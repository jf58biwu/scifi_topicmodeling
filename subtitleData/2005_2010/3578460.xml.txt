 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... So you know it 's MacPherson . - I 'm right . - Yes , I 'm afraid you are . And he now has a sword which renders him invisible . Now it 's up to you to stop him . You always hurt the one you love . Okay , just stop . Okay , stop and think this through . Guess what . I 'm still taking the artifact . I can 't let you do that , Pete . Turn around . MacPherson is alive and he 's loose somewhere in the world . - Stopping MacPherson is not your job ! - My what ? Protecting the world happens to be my job ! And right now that is being threatened by an insane ex-Warehouse agent who is competing for artifacts that belong right out there . Mrs. Frederic said that she will handle it . I can do it . He ran a sword through your chest . - I 'm all right . - You could have died . Please just let Mrs. Frederic handle it , okay ? This ? This is your job , Artie . And you 're not doing it . You have Pete , Myka , and Claudia spread out through the Warehouse taking inventory for you day after day . - Meanwhile , all ... - Meanwhile , these things are piling up . Yes , they are . I 'm pretty hard to kill . Really ? Really ? You want some of this ? Nice one . Did not see that coming . - Playing with yourself again ? - One game . A quickie . We got time . Besides , none of this stuff 's going anywhere . Right , buddy ? Okay , this stuff is dangerous , all right ? - Right . - This is Lewis Carroll 's mirror . Alice in Wonderland . " Off with their heads " . - That 's chick lit , right ? - Chick lit ? I mean , come on . Not everything in here is dangerous . You got that cuddly little ferret from a cooking pot . - Yeah , he peed in my shoes . - That was ... That was me . - That 's funny . - So what , are you still mad at Artie ? No , I 'm not . - I 'm not mad at Artie . I 'm mad at you . - No , you 're not mad at me . - Yes , I am . - You 're not mad at me . Because when you 're mad at me , your neck gets all long until it looks like that . It 's like a giraffe over here . And when you 're mad at Artie , your neck gets down over here to the right . Just like that . Look , I know the MacPherson-DC thing is still bugging you , okay ? But everybody has a past . But he lied , Pete . Artie 's past is treasonous , hazardous , there 's a crazy man who wants us dead and he wants the Warehouse for himself . Would have been nice knowing that going in . Artie should have told us about MacPherson . Yes , yes , I get it . Daddy issues . Can 't deal with the old man . You 're useless . My God ! The mirror ! I got it . Watch out . - Look , the giant thing ... - Pete ! Sick . That sounds like ... The Studio 54 disco ball . God , I hate disco . Myka , you okay ? - What 's going on ? - Myka , you okay ? What 's going on ? Ask him . You can 't ... This is ... Projet-SG ( 1.00 ) I know you 're feeling lost . What ? Artie 's past , MacPherson ... It can be a bit disorienting . I know . I feel pretty clear actually . Things are the way they are . Don 't fight it . Just go with it . Whenever I don 't , I always end up right back in the same place . Not a good one . Thank you for the tea . You 're welcome . I 'm gonna do it . I 'm doing it . I 'm doing it . They 're excellent , yes . I don 't know what ... So today 's ... Where is ... Pete , in the room , please ! You do something with your hair ? Would you help me with this bag ? Just open it up , take everything ... - Dude , dude , take your meds . - I want a turn , bro . Pete , sit . - You saved at least ? Thank you . - I saved . Focus , focus ! - Wait , what are you doing ? - Focusing . You don 't ... We 're gonna ... We ... You ... All right , nevermind , fine . Just ... Try ! try ! Pay attention . Gary and Jillian Whitman . Take one each . Aka more aliases than they would care to mention . They are small-time thieves who have inexplicably hit the big-time . - I smell artifact . - I smell a loser . Come on . Let 's let Artie get through this so we can just not be here any longer than necessary , all right ? - Thank you very much . Much appreciated . - You 're welcome . - So what is this ... this artifact ? - It 's unconfirmed . But if there 's one , it 's given these two an unbelievable amount of luck . That defies all the laws of probability . They 've had winning streaks in Miami , Detroit and Atlantic City ... Not one single gaming commission alarm bell has been tripped . Well , how ? Well , they go into a gaming room as high rollers . Anybody ? Okay , fine . And they 're really good . And they win just enough money to stay under the radar , right ? And then they get ... Fine . They move on and don 't get caught . So they 're taking a little back from the house . OMG , what 's the BFD ? What ? Iniquitous hands with the means to exploit fate . - " Iniquitous " means " bad . " - Thanks , Roget . So where are they now ? 3 hours ago , they checked into room 1510 at the Maximus hotel in Las Vegas . So I 've also prepared a rundown ... This is yours ... of possible artifacts still in the wild that might be responsible . There 's plane tickets and reservations for the Maximus and all that stuff . Vegas , baby . Kicking it . Where 's the money ? Well , we need to roll high . Yeah , there 's $ 10,000 in Pete 's envelope . Snap ! - Doubt it . Are you sure this ... - Get out . Pack . Boys . Do me a favor . Yes , my liege . I shall bring you receipts . Yeah , that too , but also , one more thing . Is she mad at me ? Maybe . A little . But look , a trip to Vegas will unbunch the pants . It should be fun . Please don 't have fun . - Yeah , or crap out . - That 's so funny . Later . - So what am I doing ? - What do you mean what are you doing ? Well , Leena told me Mrs. " F " was keeping you off the MacPherson trail , so it doesn 't mean I can 't look for him . I 'll say this once . Listen . Back off ! The man will kill you . Kill you . Understood ? Yes , sir . Hello . - How are you ? - All right . Your tie is crooked . You just knocked everything crooked . - How are my teeth ? - Your teeth are fine . Perfume ? That 's a first . So I 've been going over the possibles . And I 've been sniffing ten grand . Nothing in Artie 's hit list suggests a multi-part object , which means we 're looking for one thing and it should be in their possession . Why ? It 's Carson 's rule of linear transfer . It means they have to have it on them . Forced outcomes require tangency . Someone 's been paying attention . Some of us longer than others . Let 's assume that it 's a single artifact shared by two suspects . We each take one and we compare notes . I 'll take lady luck . You take her date . And I got these . - I ... - What is it ? I cleaned ' em with alcohol , all right ? So ... And a little bit of spit . Kidding . Testing . Sorry . You have the Tesla , right ? I 'll trade you for the Farnsworth . - But you have the gun . - I know , but it 's the boring one . - Well , you lost the toss . - I know . Let 's just go find this artifact and see if we can 't change somebody 's luck . That thing is so freaky . - What , this ? - No , the thing behind you . Yeah , that . Well , trapped desires ... Refracted by light , sound , sex ... Mind-altering drugs into a ... - Disco ball . - Disco ball . - A disco ball . - I know . - Dude , how ? - Well , unknown . Unknown , but , mirrors are usually just gonna reflect light , but this thing projects yearnings and cravings . You know what this thing does ? It imparts a grim stampeding inhumanity against anything decent . You asked . Don 't worry . No , not in here . In here it 's just a round , shiny object . - But out there ... - It 's the ' 80s . The ' 70s . By the way , I 'm sorry I came down on you a little hard at Leena 's . It 's whatever . It 's just ' cause I owe you , for helping me and saving Joshua . I mean , the guy hurt you . It pisses me off . If finding MacPherson ... Yeah . Just help me lift this thing , would you , on three . Well , can Mrs. Frederic find him ? I don 't know . On three . One , two , three . The guy used to work here though , right ? And , what , the place drove him nuts ? Something lured him to the dark side ? He is the dark side and things are lured to him , people especially , which is why you 're never gonna mention his name ever again . - Just to you . - To anyone , promise me . Is that Myka ? Whatever it is ... It 's not good . Red five . - You 're pushing our luck . - And it 's pushing right back . - Take a break . - I 'm okay . We 've got enough . Nobody 's legs are getting broken . Everybody 's paid off . College for five kids won 't be cheap . We 're having three . It won 't matter if you 're not around for the honeymoon . I 'll be around . It 's gonna be the best years of our lives . - Just five more spins . - Three . Okay , we 've found them . - You see anything ? - Besides two scoundrels in love ? No , but they might have something off-site . I 'm gonna go toss their room . Call me if you see them chewing on a rabbit 's foot or adjusting a magic girdle . Red 23 . - Careful ! - Stop yelling ! - Start listening ! - I 'm so running over your toes . - Just get it straight . Not like that ! - Okay ! - Can you close the door ? - Got it . You know what ? Pull all the Dodgson files , would you ? And anything that 's got a listed cross-reference , like Alice Liddell , Lewis Carroll . - What are you still standing here for ? - I 'm not your girl Friday . What kept you ? Three pumpkin pies and a broken oven thermostat you keep promising to fix . What 's this ? - This is why I called you . - What happened ? - Optical divagation , I think . - What ? Kind of like a retinal flare after a photo flash . My best guess is the blast from the disco ball , kind of frizzed this mirror 's primary reflective capacity and then it probably clipped part of Myka 's psyche and fused it in there . I don 't ... You know , it 's kind of like shadows on a wall after Hiroshima . - It 's a pretty lively shadow . - Yes , but is it ? - Is it what ? - Alive . Help me ! - You wanna ? - Sure . What 's that about ? I 'm gonna pull her back if she falls in . - Oh , hell . - Get your mind out of the ... - Okay . - Thanks . - So ? - Nothing . - So what is it ? Just a shadow play ? - Well , the glass is like a barrier . If that 's alive , I can 't tell . - Let 's just ask her . - " It . " " It " might have something to tell us . I mean , why can 't we just talk to her ? Because we do not converse with reflective entities , okay ? - Because ? - Because two words . Bloody Mary . That 's just an urban legend though , right ? - Of course it isn 't . - Shadows have power you let this thing speak and there is no telling what could happen . Pete was playing ping-pong with one of those things . Weren 't you supposed to go pull files or something ? Thank you . - And pull anything from Studio 54 . - Got it . - 54 . - Heard you . - Can I make a suggestion ? - Sure . - I haven 't lost a penny , Mom . - Myka with you ? No , she 's downstairs on the Whitmans . I 'm getting ready to search their room . What 's up ? How 's your radar ? You mean am I having a vibe or something ? Give it a second . Anything out of the ordinary ? - Anything at all . - With Myka ? With anything . You know , now that you mention it , there is something . - What ? - The buffet is overpriced . - Other than that ? - Nope . No vibe . No trouble . - It 's all good . - All right . Are you sure ? - Is there something I should know ? - No , no . Everything 's good . It 's just a status check . Don 't dawdle , stay in touch . Kirk out . He 's fine . So is Myka . Okay ? Put it down on red 15 . - I got nothing . - Nothing 's going on down here either . They 're still winning and I 'll be damned if I know how . I know . I am . I just think that 's ... - What if you put those two together ... - I don 't think that 's gonna work . - What about what we tried in ... - What is that ? It 's just something I whipped up . - What do you mean ? Just now ? - That 's right . Wait , wait . - What are you doing ? - I 'm opening a line of communications . CIA uses laser mics to read vibrations off windows to hear what 's going on on the other side of the window . I wanna hear what she has to say . Bloody Mary , shadows have power , I get it . But what if that 's not just a shadow ? That look on her face is somebody who 's trapped . Believe me , I know that look and so do you . If things get hinky , you can pull the plug . What do you got to lose ? I do need to do this . Wait , wait ! Let me think ! Where are you ? So Mr. Whitman doesn 't look good . - No sign of any artifact . - Not even a glimmer . - What 's up with his hand ? - I don 't know . If you want to get rest , I 'll stay with them . - Not if they split up . - I 'll call you . No , no . Let 's ... Let 's stay together . If they 've got something , it 's on ' em . I want to know what it is . I 've been burned by this before . They look real and they 'll say anything . Say something . Artie , when I get out of here , I 'm hugging her and I 'm kicking your ass . Yeah , well , that won 't be happening . Why ? - Artie , it 's me . - No , no . You 're just a reflection . The real Myka 's in Las Vegas on a mission with Pete . What ? No , no , I 'm not ! Artie ! See ? That 's exactly what I mean . You just don 't do it . Turn that thing off . Artie , if I 'm in Vegas with Pete , then how can I be here ? Just no ! Just don 't turn it off ! Whatever that thing is , it 's never getting out of here . Lewis Carroll 's Alice . You 're so sweet , so innocent , so not true . This woman was as mad as a hatter . And Charles Dodgson , aka Lewis Carroll , was not writing books . He was chronicling this young woman 's descent into a sociopathic madness in all of his books . He didn 't write these books . These are Warehouse fabrications ... Brilliant fabrications ... To hide the truth about that mirror . Here 's a report from Warehouse field agents . The mirror crossed paths with Alice Liddell . I bet it crossed paths . When ? - Before the murders . - Terrifying . Yeah , and there 's no mention of where the mirror came from . Okay , well , where do any of these things come from ? Artie , these agents , they trapped her inside of the mirror . Somehow her energy , her essence ... Even they weren 't sure how it happened . Wouldn 't it have been nice , Leena , if these Warehouse field agents had bothered to figure it out before she killed one of them ? Lot of loose ends here , okay ? So I 'm not ... That is why , Claudia , taking inventory is so important ! So what are we saying ? What are we saying ? Are we saying that just Myka 's image got melded with the crazy essence of Alice ? Yeah , that 's exactly what I 'm saying . Looks like Myka . Isn 't Myka . And if we give voice to that thing , it 'll trick us somehow to try to get out and that is not gonna happen . We 've done enough . We promised each other we 'd stop at $ 5 million . I 'm a lying , convicted thief , Gary . I 'm breaking the promise . No , we 're so close . We 're just a few thousand away . It won 't make any difference . You need to see a doctor . We don 't have any insurance . Please . We 'll be paying out of pocket . I won 't go unless we offset what that 'll cost with an hour 's worth of betting . - Listen to yourself . - You listen . My hand can rot off . I 'm not going to any doctor . We should take it now . Take what ? Whatever it is they 've got . You know , force them to hand it over . - We 're not even sure if ... - One more round of betting and - I 'm cashing us out . - You 're the boss . I was just trying to keep her distracted . We 're clear . I want him . - Sorry ? - You follow the girl . I 'll stay here and I 'll call you if he comes out . - Are you sure ? - I can handle him if there 's trouble . All right . - I 'll call you if I catch anything . - Do that . Artie , I know you 're not as sure about this as you 're pretending . I 'm not pretending . You know when you hold a mirror up to a second mirror and you get that sort of reflected infinity thing ? What happens if that mirror is reflected and it 's something like the Studio 54 disco ball ? Is it possible to get some kind of artifact interaction ? Something completely unexpected ? I don 't know . What if the disco ball goes off and someone is standing in front of the Alice 's mirror ? I think we know what happens . Do we really ? - Could reflections switch places ? - Could people ? She pulls to the right . Pardon ? I noticed it a couple months ago . When Myka 's mad at me , she pulls to the right . She 's mad at you now . Has been for about a week . - So is she ... - Pulling ... To the right ? Red 23 ! Excuse me , Miss . Hi . - You dropped this . - Keep it . Maybe you 'll get lucky . That 's what I 'm hoping . Red 21 ! Holy bananas . You 're really mad at me . - I feel sorry for you , actually . - Why is that ? Because of all the things right in front of your face that you refuse to see . Like what ? Like me . Oh , well . I need to ask you a question that only the real Myka would know the answer to . You know what ? You 're wasting time , 'cause Pete 's in danger . Yeah , well , so are you , right ? In danger if you 're who you say you are ? Okay , fine . Here 's what you and I both know but we never talk about it . All right ? That I don 't trust you . That I need you to tell me the truth . And to not treat me like some chess piece that you move around on a board that only you can see . That I am valuable . That I matter . And that I deserve to know everything I can about this world that you send me into every day so at least I have a fighting chance . You know , in spite of everything ... In spite of everything , I like you . I think you 're great . And I want you to think the same of me . I screwed up . Honey , my key 's not working . Where 's him ? Him 's not here . - What room you looking for ? - My room . Who are you ? You 're cute . And you 're faking it . You never con a con artist . You had your chance to walk away . You won 't get another . - Pete with you ? - No , listen . I 'm a bit busy . - Can I call you back ? - Yeah , no , sure . Everything okay ? It will be as soon as I can get back to work . I got some bad news . Leena tells me that your ferret escaped and she 's tried to call for it . She doesn 't know its name . I don 't even know if you finally did name that thing , did you ? No , actually , I never did . Put some food out and it 'll come back . I gotta go . Now ... Where were we ? Myka did name the ferret . She 's just not telling Pete the name . - Why not ? - Because she named it Pete . Yeah , it 's cute , but so annoying . - That 's good . I like that . - You think that 's funny , huh ? Because if she thinks we know , she 'll kill him . Name 's Pete . Look , you 're in trouble and I 'm here to help . That chip that you have , the one that 's changed your luck ... - Let go or I 'll scream . - Jillian , it 's hurting you . Okay , that is a contact wound . Wishing objects do that . This one seems to be a bit addictive and we both know that that 's bad , right ? So you keep the money , but you give me the chip . Gary 's sick too , isn 't he ? You gotta stop while you 're ahead , Jillian . Trust me . Don 't make me use this . The Jubilee Grand , right ? The fire ? What are you gonna do with it ? I am gonna put this on a shelf and ignore it forever . I know . Now watch . Watch what ? That chip allows you to see the future . Yeah , I can see the attraction . You have to tell me what 's going on , Artie . Well , he may have figured it out already . Seriously ? I mean , it 's Pete we 're talking about . I can 't get ahold of him . His cell keeps going to voice mail . - Alice has obviously the Farnsworth . - Dude ... He 's in a big hotel . There was this man at the bar one night bragging about how he miraculously survived the inferno . He said that this chip saved his life . - And you stole it ? - It 's what we do . Pete Lattimer , white courtesy telephone . Jillian , take the money and run , don 't walk . Find a beach . Never look back . I am gonna go get your husband . Wait , hold on . You 're not arresting us ? You 're letting us go ? What happens in Vegas , okay ? Just get outta here . It looks like you were telling the truth . Don 't hurt Jillian . Do you know what ? Hurting is half the fun . You wanna know what 's more fun ? The other half . Who are you ? You 've had your wishes . Now , it 's my turn . And now I 'll know when they 're coming for me . And if I can see them , I can kill them . I bet you didn 't see that coming . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . I had to use the Tesla . He 's dead . You killed him . - Pete , what 's going on ? - Change of plans . What do you think , I 'm an idiot ? Don 't answer that . Look , just stop , okay ? Just put down the gun and let 's think this through . - I 'm still taking the artifact . - I can 't let you do that . Die trying to stop me , Alice . Oh , clever boy . What tipped you ? The real Myka ... would never kiss me . Never ! Not if her life depended on it . - Which is ... - A shame . You 're a good kisser . - So Artie hasn 't figured this out yet . - Well , not yet . But when he does , he 'll set the real Myka free , and you will ... poof ... disappear . It doesn 't work that way , Pete . Meaning what ? Meaning nothing comes out of the mirror unless something goes back in . Really ? And I am done ... with that . I beg to freaking differ . Freak . I suppose I should have destroyed that mirror when I had the chance . Turn around . This is on you . You 're the one who set me free . Well , I 'm fixing that right now . Turn around . Oh , my ... I am never going back into that mirror . Do you hear me ? Never . And this . This is my ace . That 's it . Cash me out . Curiouser and curiouser . Artie , now ! Pete , help me . Artie , where is Myka ? - Thank you . - Yeah , you 're welcome . All right . Here , let 's get this . - So what now ? - Now ... Now we move Alice to the dark vault . - What 's the dark vault ? - It 's better than the " oy gevalt . " The dark vault . You 've never seen the dark vault . I 'm gonna hazard a guess here you 're never gonna want to see the dark vault after we move that to there . Okay , you get the ... No , you know what ? Let 's do this tomorrow . You know , we better secure it . You know , let 's move that trunk . When I say " let 's , " I mean you . Little known but apropos fact , by the way , Steven Rubell , who was one of the co-founders of Studio 54 , he considered calling his club Wonderland . Oh , my God ! - Other side . Other side . - Hey , lady ! Yeah , okay , let 's go . - My ten grand ? - Right , about that . Well , Artie , you know , last-minute Apache helicopter rides to the middle of nowhere , - South Dakota , don 't come cheap . - I know a guy with a Chinook . Would have cost you about half if you would have called me ! Well , I had to beat Alice here , didn 't I ? Did it work ? - Look who 's here . - Oh , my God ! Yeah , making breakfast . Come on . So , Myka , you said I was a good kisser .

 What do you want ? Your help . Do you hate me for giving you life ? The Bane get hold of this and they take over the galaxy . Hello , Sir Alistair . Sarah Jane Smith . I need to break into the Black Archive . We have to stop them bringing him back to life . Security breach ! Oh , the sweetness of revenge ! Typical . I turn vegetarian , and now I 'm Bane munchies . What happened to Mrs Wormwood ? Don 't know . Could be one of these , for all I can tell . Tap ! Come on ! Go ! Nothing eats Clyde Langer without a fight . Your kindred have the half-forms trapped . They 're not my kindred , Kaagh . Not any more . I 'm like you . An outcast with no family . Then they will feast on the Smith woman 's boy and his friend . No . Not today . Kaagh , my phonic disruptor needs an energy boost . I think they 're done playing with their food . Bane Kindred ! Humans are off the menu ! Nice one , Mrs W. CAR SCREECHES TO A HALT Luke ! I told you to stay away from her ! She saved our lives . It 's true . We were Bane bait , then Mrs W fixed them with her ring thing . Saving human lives is becoming a bit of a habit with me , Miss Smith . I do hope we can conclude our business together before I am scarred for life . Do you have the scroll ? Yes . Then give it to me . I don 't think this is the right time . Half of UNIT is probably headed this way right now ! Miss Chandra 's right . We should be on our way . And , erm ... who are you ? Brigadier Sir Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart , at your service . I know the last place UNIT 'll look for us . Let 's go ! Hiding out in a flower shop ? I think it 's an excellent idea . Rani 's right , it 's the last place UNIT will look . Tea . Come on , Mum 's got a kettle out the back . So , now may I see the scroll ? I should thank you . For saving Luke and Clyde . Oh , there 's no need . I am an outcast from the Bane Kindred . Their only interest in me now is one of digestion . I take the deepest satisfaction in ensuring they go hungry . Don 't you have any children of your own ? Any - what would you call them - spawn ? No . I am alone . Completely . I was alone . For a long , long time . Until I met Luke . Then perhaps you should be indebted to me , for enriching your sad , purposeless life . Don 't push it , Wormwood ! Just give me the scroll . First , tell me exactly how you were able to save Luke and Clyde . Mr Smith 's containment vortex is designed to draw the energy from any weapon confined within it . How very ingenious . And how unfortunate . Not another inch , Mrs Wormwood . The battle of the costume jewellery counter , how very female . Perhaps what we need here is a more masculine influence . Kaagh ! Kaagh ! A Sontaran always keeps an oath of vengeance . You alien chaps never get the message , do you ? The sonic lipstick . No ! You will regret doing that , Kaagh . You shall regret robbing me of the honour of Sontar - for all eternity ! Kaagh and I both have a score to settle , Miss Smith . Our vengeance will span a galaxy . Kaagh has the Consciousness of Horath . He is the Bane 's agent ! And you 're both double-crossing them . I could never return to Sontar . What sort of soldier is beaten by a female and half-forms ? I was reduced to working as a mercenary for the Bane . Kaagh was carrying the Consciousness of Horath for the Bane when he recognised me on a planet in the Snake-Tongue Nebula . The Bane had put a high price on my head . But I encouraged Kaagh to see the bigger picture - a much bigger picture . So , give me the scroll . Don 't do it , Sarah Jane ! Oh , I suggest you do . Or Kaagh will disintegrate your friends , one at a time . You 're mad ! It will destroy you . It will destroy everything . Oh , really , Miss Smith . You 're so negative . Power has such beauty , hasn 't it , Kaagh ? Power is the most beautiful thing in the universe . Shall I destroy them now ? No ! Leave them alone , Mrs Wormwood ! My mum 's given you what you wanted , now get out ! Such a brave boy . So much more than a boy . Keep away from him ! Luke , I will spare your friends , if you will come with me . No ! He 's going nowhere with you . He is my son ! And I gave him the intelligence to make his own choices . Well , Luke ? No , Luke ! Very well , then you all die . Kaagh ? I 'll come with you ! But you don 't hurt anyone . You have to promise . No , Luke ! I promise you , Sarah Jane Smith , that as long as you can resist that infuriating tendency to meddle , Luke will be safe . Take him away , Kaagh . Luke ! I love you ! And I love you ! We are not finished , Mrs Wormwood ! Oh , I think we are , Miss Smith . THEY SCREAM IN PAIN GATE CREAKS OPEN Sarah ? Is that you , Sarah ? Aaagh ! I didn 't realise Sarah Jane had a nephew . I didn 't think she had any relatives at all , to be honest . We 're not a close family . Well , you shouldn 't have to wait long . Sarah 's always very busy with her newspaper stories . She 's teaching my daughter - that 's Rani , very bright - all the tricks of the trade . Ooh , I could call her , if you like . Tell Sarah you 're here . No . It 's OK . When Aunt Sarah Jane gets home , I 'd like it to be a surprise . Of course . We understand . Out , half-form ! Be careful , Kaagh ! This isn 't a bout of Sontaran quicksand wrestling . He is a boy . They break . Or so I understand . I will make sure the perimeter is secure . Where are we ? Some squalid wasteland , rancid with the stench of stagnant oil and rotting fast-food wrappers , typical of this depressing planet you call home . I like Earth . Your development has been stunted by a lack of spectacular horizons . What sort of a mother has Sarah Jane Smith been ? The boy I made was more than this . You didn 't make me . You just grew me from synthesized DNA . Living here has made me what I am . KAAGH KICKS AT NEARBY DOOR I 'm like Kaagh . Bred for one purpose . But life has changed him . He 's supposed to serve the Sontaran Empire . Instead , he serves you . No Sontaran would serve a woman ! I should blast you into atoms for such an insult ! Don 't you see , the boy engages in mind games ? He 's clever . I won 't do anything for you ! KAAGH LAUGHS You already have . You are our hostage . Sarah Jane Smith won 't move against us while we have you . Too much talk , Kaagh . Get me what we came for . This way . Kaagh 's space pod ! Soon , I will look upon a galaxy crushed to stardust beneath my feet . I want Sarah Jane Smith to know she gave it to me . And that she gave you to me . Such shall be my vengeance . Why is revenge so important ? KAAGH LAUGHS Humans . The runts of the galaxy . No wonder half the species from here to the Vylixik Spiral Cluster have plans to invade you . You have no guts ! My mum does . That 's why she defeated you before . Both of you . And she will this time . She will have to find us to do that . And to our destination , there is only one guide . Kaagh ? The Eye of Horath begins to open . And the galaxy shall tremble . Sarah Jane ! Sarah Jane , wake up ! How long have I been unconscious ? Luke ! We have to get him back . And the Tunguska Scroll . She thinks kidnapping Luke will stop me going after her . She really doesn 't understand motherhood ! The scroll is a receiver , isn 't it ? It 's searching for a homing signal from Horath . It 's not so much a map as a Sat Nav . This drab world may have stunted your potential , Luke , but you still remain so very impressive . So intelligent , so perceptive , so intuitive . After 3,000 years , the signal is faint . But the scroll will locate it . And then , we shall find Horath . Horath was never a living being , was he ? Horath is a cybernetic organism . A computer ? And so much more . A computer that can command the physical laws of the universe . That can destroy worlds and give birth to them in the blink of an eye . As I gave birth to you . The universe is a cruel place , Luke . It delights at the tricks it plays . How could I ever have imagined that it would come to this , that my only kindred , my only child , would be the most perfect human ? I can see why Sarah Jane Smith is so attached to you , my boy . You 're not my mother . I gave you life , Luke , and I can give you so much more . There are such wonderful things out in space . Amazing things . Be my prince and you will inherit an entire galaxy ! You could wield such power . As my son . CLANKING AND RATTLING OF METAL What about Kaagh ? Kaagh is a foot-soldier . Bred for war , not to rule . Unlike you . Here , my son . KAAGH ! Half-form ! HE SCREAMS IN ANGER I will fry you alive , half-form ! Bring him back to me ! Alive ! You cannot escape ! Defiance will be eliminated ! I said , I want him alive , idiot Sontaran ! HE SNIFFS HE CACKLES HE CACKLES The Bane woman has her fancy idea of vengeance . But for what you and your half-form friends did to me , you will taste Sontaran reckoning ! No-one comes between a Sontaran warrior and his prize of vengeance . Except you 're no longer a Sontaran warrior , are you , Kaagh the Slayer ? Kaagh the Shambles , more like ! HE CRIES OUT Now , do we understand each other ? Yes . But not the logic in keeping a half-form alive . Of course you wouldn 't , Kaagh . You are a clone . You were born in a tub of green goo . You 've never created anything , only destroyed . But as long as the Bane hunt for me , I need you . The scroll has re-established contact with Horath . Our journey is almost done . A new age nears . No sign of UNIT . Yeah , they 're soldiers , trained to disappear into the background . Mr Smith is our only chance of finding Luke and stopping Mrs Wormwood . Hang on ! UNIT don 't know me . I can go in and do a recce . See if the coast 's really clear and they wouldn 't suspect a thing . Clyde Langer , superspy ! MOBILE RINGS Clyde ? All clear . Be right there . Where is he ? This does not look good . Clyde ? Major ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Let him go ! I always follow orders . I 'm afraid all of you are under arrest . Major , you are making an earth-shattering mistake . Give me the Tunguska Scroll . Please listen . We 're trying to save the galaxy . Just give me the scroll ! We haven 't got it anymore ! What ? ! My son 's been kidnapped . I 'm trying to save him , can 't you understand that ? My only concern is homeworld security . Yeah , well it looks to me like you 're sitting down on the job ! I 'd stay where you are if I were you . He 's got worse than that . You do what you have to . I 'll keep an eye on the Major . Rani , stay with the Brigadier . Clyde , with me . I registered these energy readings from the Tunguska Scroll . I need you to initiate a tracker search across the UK for it . When I said my only concern was homeworld security ... .. I meant my world . Not yours . 'Satellite tracking now active . ' They could be anywhere . We 've got no idea how much time we 've got . Wherever they are , however much time we have , we have one advantage - Luke . Remember that . 'Target acquired . It is apparently mobile , 'and heading along the A786 towards the village of Whitebarrow . ' Hang on ! We went there on a school trip . It 's one of those places like , er ... Stonehenge ! A neolithic burial site ! 3,000 years old ! That 's where Horath is buried . You 're Bane ? ! I 'm warning you , sir , keep your distance ! No , Sir Alistair . Remember , I invited you to dinner . And you 're it ! I warned you ! I always suspected that Major Kilburne was a slimy creep ! Come on . Well , of course you can borrow my van , Sarah . It 's the least I can do . I hope your funny little motor isn 't too poorly . Thank you . I appreciate it more than you can ever know . Don 't be late for tea . Thank you for all your help , Brigadier . Oh , my pleasure , Sarah Jane . I 'll keep an eye on what 's left of the Major until the UNIT chaps take him away . You do what you have to do , and God speed . Move ! This is it ! The resting place of Horath , the birthplace of a new galactic aeon ! The Age of Wormwood ! And Kaagh ! If you really want the empire to sound like a firm of solicitors . No female can rule an empire alone . You need me , Wormwood ! Aagh ! It seems you 're right . A blundering Sontaran has its uses . It 's a forcefield . You 've come all this way for nothing . Not at all . The force field must be attuned to non-Earth life forms - those who concealed Horath within its stones would see that humans were no threat . They 're too stupid . Only an off-worlder would know what was hidden here , and they would be kept safely at bay . Ha ! How very clever . Yet , I , Luke , have you . Of course ! I see it now . It was meant that I should give you life , then lose you to Sarah Jane Smith , that you should remain on Earth awaiting my return . For this moment . You 're talking about fate . I don 't believe in fate . I made you for this moment , Luke . To enter the circle of stones , and to be my prince . Mum was right . You are mad . Sarah Jane Smith was the wet-nurse ! I am your mother . Now , do as I say and fulfil your destiny . Bring me Horath . Like you , half-form , I believe we make our own destiny . But mine lies within that circle . So do as she says . Place the scroll on the altar stone at the heart of the circle . Do it ! Do it , my prince ! Come quickly , Mum ! The Age of Wormwood approaches ! BRAKES SCREECH It 's an earthquake ! We have to hurry . We may already be too late ! Luke , see ! The scroll is unlocking the Tomb of Horath . It 's a portal . Horath was never buried on Earth . This is a doorway to somewhere else . Another dimension , maybe . That 's where Horath is ! And you have opened that door , Luke . You have earned your place at my side - rulers of a billion stars . Soon , the most almighty power in the universe will be ours . What treachery is this , Bane ? The half-form has no place in our bargain . Consider our arrangement ... terminated ! HE SCREAMS Join me , my son . No . You can 't control the portal . It 's too powerful . Sarah Jane Smith has made you timid , Luke . But I shall make you strong . You shall be a god . I don 't want to be a god . It is your fate . To sit beside your mother and preside over all creation . You are my prince . Luke ! Mum ! Thank goodness you 're all right ! Luke ! It never looked like that when we came with the school ! Whoops ! The National Trust is gonna be pleased about that - a stone circle with a black hole in the middle ! I 'd pay to see it . The portal ! It 's opened . Luke . Come with me , Luke . I will show you things beyond even your imagination . Half-form ! I 'm trying to help you . Are you hurt ? Come to me , Luke . Come to your mother . No . Sarah Jane is my mother . Do you hear that , Mrs Wormwood ? Luke is my son ! Because I have cared for him and looked after him , because I love him ! And you don 't understand love . People who understand love don 't want to crush planets , or take over the universe . Those people aren 't people at all , they truly are monsters . You 're right , Miss Smith . And it is so much more fun to embrace one 's nature . Get me my gun ! No . I can 't . I have been a disgrace to Sontar . I have betrayed the brotherhood of warriors . Give me this chance of honour ! And what more fun could there be than to ... destroy ? With your deaths , the Age of Wormwood shall begin ! Sontar-haaaaa ! THEY SHRIEK Get down ! EXPLOSION What happened ? Mrs Wormwood was about to discharge her ring when Kaagh pushed her into the portal . I think it sort of overloaded the system . Is she dead ? I don 't know . Hey , the scoll 's still here . You 've got another one ! Do I look like the kind of girl who only has one lipstick ? What are you gonna do ? What UNIT should have done when they first found it . Now the portal is closed for good . No-one will ever find Horath . We saved the universe . Again ! Did we ? I told you when we first met , Rani , the universe is an amazing place , it 's got so many surprises for us . But one thing I never expected to see was the universe being saved by a Sontaran ! 'Yet the truly marvelous thing is to share the wonders 'that the universe brings us , with good , true friends . 'The people we can rely on , no matter what . 'The people we love . ' Bye , Sarah Jane ! 'But the universe hasn 't finished with us yet . 'There will always be some alien species visiting Earth . 'And why not ? It 's a wonderful place to be ! ' Just remember who lives here .

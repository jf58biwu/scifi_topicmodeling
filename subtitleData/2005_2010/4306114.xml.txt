 Here you go . Thanks . One more for the road ? Keep out the cold and wet . Oh , no , not for me . Curfew 's in 20 minutes , the sun 's going down even quicker and the last thing I want to do is spend the night in a Cylon jail cell . Cylons show up to help us , first thing they do is build a jail . He 's so beautiful . You two should have one . We 're working on that . Okay . Great work if you can get it . Thanks , bye . Bye , be safe . We need to find you a lady , buddy , you 're starting to walk funny . Hey , if Nora has a sister , I 'm there . Sorry , I can 't help you . Story of my life . Oh , no , no , no . We quit . If we 're going to have a baby we 've got to clean up our act . Did you hear about Longo ? No . What ? Toasters got him . They found his weapons stash . TIGH : Do you think Duck will bite ? Jammer 's finding out right now . The Cylons didn 't get them all . Longo had these hidden under his latrine . This is all that 's left ? This is frakking pathetic . If this keeps up , we 'll have nothing but rocks left to throw at the bastards . Yeah , and nobody to throw them . They shot him in cold blood ? Toasters claim when they found his stash he was reaching for his gun . What ? Charlie 's not that stupid . Those frakkers murdered him . Gods . Poor Charlie . NORA : Hiding weapons in his tent . What does he expect ? And now they want us to do their dirty work for them . Are you kidding me ? New Caprica Police ? What a bunch of crap . Some people say it 's a good thing . What ? Get the Centurions off the streets and let us patrol them ourselves . Maybe Charlie would still be alive if they had human ... Oh , no , no , no , no . No matter how you try to swing this , you work for the toasters , it 's treason . That 's it . Let 's go . Oh , hell . I forgot my hat back at the Chief 's . I 'll see you later . All right . See you , man . Yeah . What do you think about him being a godfather ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah . It 's bed time . Adama 's not going to have a hope in hell of getting us off this rock if we don 't put together an effective fighting force . I 'm going to have to keep these here until we find a better hiding place . Colonel , I got a wife , a newborn , I can 't ... We 'll move them as soon as we can . Well ? Duck hates the toasters , no doubt about that . He 's also an ex-Viper jock with 40 kills . Talk to him , make him understand that we need him . Throw in some poetic crap about the struggle for liberty against the Cylon oppressors , whatever it takes . We need more people , or this resistance movement is gonna die in its crib .

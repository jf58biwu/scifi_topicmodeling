 NARRATOR : Previously on Heroes . Give me one good reason why I shouldn 't tear open your head right here . Because you 'll never find your dad . We need to show progress . These are our targets . Hunt them , track them , and bring them home alive . If you kill me , I 'll get exactly what I want . And what is that ? They 'll see what I 've been telling them . They 'll know just how dangerous you people are . Daphne 's alive , Matt ! They have her , alive . You 're lying to me ! No , no , no , no , no . I won 't fight you . Your mother wants me to move out of the house for a while . She 's right . We keep too many secrets in this family . They 're just locking people up ? Believe it , it 's happening . Somebody sent me to warn you . You must be on a list or something . I can breathe underwater . CLAIRE : You 're in danger . You need to get out of here immediately . We 're all out of whole wheat . Sorry . Whatever . I 'm starving . Well , my mom 's going to the market soon , so hopefully , she 'll take Lyle . You can come downstairs , stretch your legs a bit . Well , that 's a good thing . I 'm starting to stink . Look , I 've got the cash . There 's a train leaving for Albuquerque tonight . Albuquerque ? I don 't know anyone in Albuquerque . Well , that 's the point . You can start over , become a new person where no one can find you . Yeah , but I never agreed to that . Okay , my family 's here , my friends , my life . Look , do you want them to find you ? Make you disappear forever ? They 're gonna find me anyways . The government has those spy satellites . They 're probably watching us right now . No . No , we 're fine . Yeah , but you don 't know that . Look , you 're not Harriet Tubman , Claire , all right ? And this isn 't the Underground Railroad . You 're just a high school girl , and you 're in way over your head . Well , if it wasn 't for this high school girl , you might already be dead . So you want to survive , you 're gonna have to do exactly what I tell you . Got it ? SANDRA : Claire ? I need to speak with you . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Claire ? Hey , Mom . What 's up ? Our house money is gone . You know , the money I keep in Mr. Muggles ' rubber sneaker . Any idea where that went ? Maybe Lyle took it . Already grilled him . Per usual , he has no clue . Okay , fine , I took it . I was gonna pay you back . Claire , I don 't get it . You have a nice allowance . What do you need $ 300 for ? Are you in some kind of trouble ? No , I just ... ( MR. MUGGLES BARKING ) What is it , Muggles ? What 's under the bed , boy ? What is it ? What is going on with you , Claire ? Nothing . Nothing , I swear . ( BANGING ) I didn 't hear anything . Mrs. Bennet , right ? Hi . Home , sweet home . Not anymore . Got a one-bedroom in Dupont Circle . You don 't mind that we 're keeping an eye on your daughter ? Making sure she 's behaving herself ? Claire 's a big girl . She makes her own decisions . If she does something wrong , she can live with the consequences . Ladies and gentlemen , your attention please . Peter Petrelli has joined Matt Parkman as priority one . Charged with kidnapping , assault and attempted murder of federal officers . Both of these men are considered armed and dangerous and should be taken down by any means necessary . Short of lethal force . Actually , Senator , my men have been given the go-ahead , shoot to kill . On whose authority , Danko ? Mine . Back to work . Do you really want to push my hand ? Your brother came into my house and put a gun to my head . I saved your life , if I remember . He made this personal . I do what I need to do . Keep an eye on him for me , will you ? Matt and Peter kidnapped me and threatened my life . What makes you think I won 't shoot them myself ? Sir , we have a lead . Manhattan . Matt . Matt . What ? Matt , you need to stop . Matt . Matt , you need to stop . Stop . Stop . What happened ? Look , you 've been painting the same image over and over again all night , okay ? I 'm guessing you 're trying to find some answers how to stop this . Oh , God . Look , we need to leave , okay ? It 's too dangerous here . We gotta go now . No ! The only thing that matters right now is finding Daphne and getting her back . One life at a time . Okay . Look , man , what ... When you were in Bennet 's head , could you see , could you tell where Daphne was ? Anything ? I don 't know . I don 't know . I mean , I didn 't see much . I saw a hallway . Okay . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) Did you turn that on ? No . Who the hell is Rebel ? I have no idea . Address . Daphne . Someone 's listening to our conversation . No , no , no . He 's just hacking in . This could be information . We need this information . No . We don 't know who this is . How can we trust this person , huh ? What if this is a setup ? And what if he 's telling the truth ? Go ! Go , go , go . AGENT : They 're gone . We just missed them . I think I know where they 're headed . Mom , this is Alex . He 's ... He 's my new boyfriend . Okay , that doesn 't explain why he 's hiding in your closet . Right . Well , we 're ... Are you really gonna make me say it out loud ? Absolutely . We 're having sex , and I know it 's wrong , very , very wrong . You do understand that my daughter is only 17 ? I haven 't touched her , okay ? I barely even make eye contact . SANDRA : Claire ? The truth ? He 's like me . He has an ability . You can tell her . I can breathe underwater . He has a power and you brought him here ? Dad was after him . I didn 't know what else to do . Do you have any idea how dangerous this is ? Yes , I do . But what was I supposed to do ? Just let him ... And on top of that , you lied to me . I am so disappointed . SYLAR : The agents still there ? Pretty sure you lost them when you skidded off onto the dirt road . But just to be sure . Yeah , we 're clear . Officially off the grid . No communications within 50 miles . You sound disappointed . Well , maybe I am . I mean , the way I see it , agents catch up with us , we just ... ( IMITATES EXPLOSION ) Charbroil them from the inside out . I don 't want to leave a trail of dead bodies directly to my father 's house . Why are we even doing this ? Parents suck . You never get what you want from them . When I was a kid , I just wanted my dad to take me fishing . He used my arm as an ashtray instead . Seriously , look , I have the scars to prove it . ( EXCLAIMING ) You should have worn a seat belt . Dude , you 're hurting me . Why don 't you want me to see my father ? I just ... I don 't get ... You don 't need to get anything . My father 's the only one with answers . ( EXHALING ) You 're the most powerful dude on the planet . I mean , what could you possibly need ? We don 't need anyone . What ? ( TIRES SCREECHING ) Hey , what are you doing ? What the hell . If you 're hungry , there 's a burger place up the road . ( EXCLAIMING ) I 'm sorry I lied to you . I should have told you about Alex . What you 're doing is extremely dangerous , Claire . Do you understand that ? ( SIGHING ) They were gonna lock him up . For no reason . And they 'll do the same thing to you . This is not a game . Mom , I have to do this . I know that it 's hard for you . You want a normal life , a regular family , but that 's why Dad and I have to lie . So we can protect you . Why ? Because I 'm some fragile creature in need of protection ? No , that 's not what I meant . I know what you meant . And I 've got news for you . I 'm strong . Much stronger than either you or your father think , and I know more than you think I know . For example , I know that right now , there 's a van parked outside on the street . They 're watching us . They 're watching you . MAN : You think she 's hiding the Woolsley kid ? Absolutely . I 'm telling you , she 's helping him . Those pool cleaners have been parked out there for four hours . Nobody 's pool is that dirty . This is bad . How are you gonna save Alex , Claire ? You can 't go out there . Are you gonna keep him up in your closet forever ? No . No , I 'll come up with something . I have a plan . I just haven 't thought of it yet . I have an idea . You do ? Yeah . And you can either keep me in the dark and lie to protect me , or you can let me help . I say we definitely let her help . All right , Mom , what 's the plan ? We 're not gonna have a lot of time . We get in there , you do your mind-control magic , and then we get Daphne and we 're out . MATT : It 's impossible . I mean , look at this building . It 's gotta be jam-packed full of people . There 're only so many minds that I can control at any given time . You know what ? You 're right . You 're right . Hey , what are you doing ? What is that ? I just borrowed your power . Great . That way we can watch each other 's backs . And you can 't fly now . Which basically rules out our rooftop escape plan . You see , we gotta get into the building first . And two guys pushing thoughts is better than one . Come on . Top floor . I love doing that . Right . It makes it a lot easier . They got cameras everywhere . Let 's go . PETER : In here , come on . Hey , you 're not allowed in here . You 're gonna finish your lunch in the hall and make sure no one comes in . I 'll just finish my lunch in the hall . I thought the plan was to find Daphne . Gotta know where to look , huh ? Sir , take a look at this . MR. BENNET : Okay , this is a problem . How the hell did they get in here ? The targets are in Operations . Shut down the computer systems . Everything . Can 't . Someone 's hacking in . Damn it , just shut it down ! Let 's go . Wait . To hell with that . I wouldn 't go out there if I were you . You 're not me . Son of a bitch . What ? How 'd you do on your history exam ? C minus . Right . You 're grounded . Driver 's license , please . Now . Thank you . That was harsh . He 's a terrible driver anyway . ( SIGHING ) SANDRA : To disappear , you 'll need a new identity . Trick is to remove the photo without tearing it . There . ( SCOFFING ) I cannot believe you know how to make a fake ID . Where did you learn that ? Dad ? No . Claire , believe it or not , I was a teenager once . An enterprising one not unlike you , young lady . There was this band once , I just had to see . Def Leppard . Oh , my God , Rick Savage , bass player , so cute . What I would have given to ... Mom ! Sorry . Alex , you need to change your looks . They 're probably using facial recognition algorithms . That I learned from your father . You can find a change of clothes upstairs . I appreciate everything that you 're doing . Wow . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) You know , I didn 't mean to drag you into all of this . You were gonna do it one way or another , Claire . Just thought I might help . I 'm sorry for being the way I am , making everything so much harder . Sometimes , I just wish I was normal . Why on Earth would you want that ? It would just make everything easier . Maybe you and Dad would still be together . Honey , your father and I had issues long before you came around . Why did you marry him ? 'Cause I fell in love with him , warts and all . He was dangerous , handsome ... I accepted everything that went with that . But now , I 'm tired of being lied to . I can 't see my marriage anymore . So , it 's over ? You guys are gonna get a divorce ? I don 't know . Maybe . But whatever happens between your father and I has nothing to do with you . Okay ? ( WHISPERING ) So , what are we looking for ? Something happened here . ( COUGHING ) Yeah , like a million years ago . I 've been here before . How do you know ? I remember . My father was here , too . ( COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ) LUKE : Hello ? Where did you just go ? I can remember my father . Are you sure ? Positive . Sorry . It 's okay . I still don 't know why you 're doing all this for me . Well , we 're an endangered species , I just ... Doing my best to try to save us . Hell , I didn 't even know there were others like me . I remember that feeling . So , how do I look ? Like an exceptionally cute boy who can breathe underwater . You 're special , Claire . And not just because of the whole immortal , healing thing . I don 't know , maybe if things were different , we could 've gone out or something . We could 've been hiding in your bedroom for entirely different reasons . Even if things were different , I 'm not really into the whole relationship thing right now . Hmm . It just seems like everyone who gets married gets a divorce . Okay , I think it 's more like half of all marriages get a divorce or something . Yeah , but who knows how happy that other half is ? I don 't know . I still think it 's worth it . Why ? For moments like this . When someone gets you the way that no one else does , it 's definitely worth it . Those agents are coming toward the house . Alex , come with me . Come with me ! Go ! Come on . In here . This is the first place they 're gonna look . SANDRA : You have to whack it . Watch . Now , get down here and push it with your foot . Your dad used to store guns , files , God knows what else in there . He doesn 't think I know about it . Careful . Okay . Now , close it . Close it behind you . ALEX : Okay . Just another day in the Bennet house . Let 's go . That is so weird . Let 's go . You 're not supposed to be here . I 'm off-limits . Top floor is clear . I told you , you 're wasting your time . Come on , Claire . We both know what 's going on . Hot guy , just your type . Where is he ? He 's here . I know it . Well , that would be wrong , wouldn 't it ? SANDRA : If you two are finished here , I need you to get the hell out of my house . ALEX : Wow , that was close . I can 't believe the way you stood up to that bitch . Let 's not celebrate yet . They 're not gonna give up so easily . The train 's leaving soon . We need to find a way to get you to the station . You have both done enough . Maybe I can slip out back , make a run for it . No , they 'll catch you . Maybe not . We 're gonna give him a head start . I think I got something . Daphne ? Millbrook , right ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah , she 's not here anymore , Matt . Transferred to a medical facility . Damn it , of course . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) Wait , hold on a second . Okay , your friend is back . Rebel ? Tell him he screwed us . Daphne 's gone ! He 's opening up a file . I think there 's something he wants us to see . What ? What is it ? Come here . Come here . That 's us . ( EXCLAIMING ) That 's us . That 's the entire operation . They got the whole thing on tape . What are you doing ? Copying the files . What for ? To expose them . Look ... American citizens rounded up like this , no warrants , no trials . This is gonna look great on the evening news . Nathan 's not gonna know what hit him . We 'll use this as leverage . Daphne 's not here , Matt . There 's no guarantee that we 're gonna find her . But if we have this ... We can make a deal . Everything we 've got in exchange for Daphne . One life at a time . Parkman 's a telepath , incredibly powerful , but when he uses his ability his senses become raw nerves , and he becomes susceptible . We exploit that , we can disrupt his thoughts . It just might work . Let 's do it . ( FIRE ALARM BLARING ) Peter , I can 't focus . We gotta get out of here . I need more time ! It 's done . I got it ! Matt ! What ? 30 seconds for what ? It 's off . Come on . Let 's go . Go ! Whoa , whoa ! Wait , you do not want to shoot us . Wait , wait . Down , down . Good , good , good . Don 't do it . This is only gonna end badly . Don 't do this ! I 'll hold them . You go . No , what about you ? There 's no time ! You go . Go . I 'll hold them . Matt , you know me . Nice and easy . Something terrible happened here . What are you talking about ? It 's a toy car . What 's the big deal ? No . My father did something to me , something I forgot . Well , that 's a good thing , right ? I mean , not remembering all the crap that happens to you when you were a kid . No . It eats away at your soul . ( INAUDIBLE ) SYLAR : Mommy . Mommy . So you didn 't find Peter ? You 're not helping him , are you ? Don 't be ridiculous . Someone 's out there calling himself Rebel . He knows where Building 26 is , how it runs . So I see . You have all that information , too . Tell me this isn 't you . Of course not . First of all , I don 't know the first thing about computers . Yeah , you can hire someone for that , Mom . And beyond that , I know who 's keeping me safe , Nathan . I can live my life in peace thanks to your generosity . I would never betray you . Look , Peter ... He stole dangerous files , and there are people who want him dead because of that . You 're in charge . You can protect him . I 'm doing everything I can to contain and control these people with abilities , but there are other people that want to see them all dead . Yes , dear , I 've had a bit of experience with all this . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Hello ? It 's me . Pete , where are you ? Is he okay ? I 'm only gonna say this once . You know what I took . I 've got evidence against you and your entire organization . What you 've been doing to us . What do you want ? A trade . Matt Parkman and Daphne Millbrook for everything that I 've got . NATHAN : That 's it ? Two people ? I don 't understand . Look , if anything happens to them or me , all the information I 've got goes directly to the nightly news . Do you want that ? So , do we have a deal ? Fine . Where do you wanna meet ? Hey . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) My son and I are going to a movie . Does that threaten the federal government ? ( CRASHING ) You okay ? Yeah , fine . You can get off of me now . ( CHUCKLING ) Oh , God . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) We gotta go . That way . Yeah . MALE AGENT : End of the block . I think I see them . We all set ? The town car 's ready . Ten minutes to the exchange . Your boys know where they 're headed , right ? Exactly where your brother wants , 4001 North Nebraska Avenue . Right next to the network news . I don 't suppose that 's a coincidence . Peter 's no dummy . Daphne and Matt ready for transport ? No , Senator , they 're not . We 're not making the deal . What 's he talking about ? What the hell are you talking about ? I have another plan . You realize if my brother is harmed in any way , copies of those files are gonna make their way to every news organization in this country . Our entire operation will be compromised . I 'm aware of the situation . Then get Millbrook and Parkman released right now , put them in a car and get them down to the parking lot . Or do you wanna disobey a direct order ? I 'm following orders , Senator . Just not yours . " The United States government " will not make deals with terrorists . " Those were the President 's exact words . Despite your endless protestations , your brother is a terrorist . Terrorist ? My brother 's not a terrorist . WOMAN ON RADIO : Target spotted approaching parking lot . I 'm en route . Hold your stations . Just stay out of my way . Let 's go . I 'm all right . Just remember , Peter can hear your thoughts . Where are they , Bennet ? Peter ... PETER : Matt ? Daphne ? Listen to me . Are you in there ? Come with me ... Matt ? ... and nobody has to get hurt . Peter . MR. BENNET : Listen to me . They 're not here . You 're being set up . DANKO : Time to die , Petrelli . Just a little further . Give me the kill shot . MR. BENNET : I 'm trying to save your life . Get out of here ! He 's gonna ... ( WHOOSHING ) Are you all right ? It 's just a scratch . He 'll be fine . What do you want , a thank you ? Why are you doing this , Nathan ? Doing what ? Saving your life or trying to save the world ? Perhaps there 's a better way of doing it . Ma , this hasn 't turned out exactly the way I 've wanted it to , okay ? I 'm aware of that . There 's a lot of different agendas going on . Yeah , all leading to killing us . You realize you 're responsible for that . Yeah , I do . It 's out of control , and it 's my fault . But I can fix it . In fact , I 'm the only one who can fix it . Why is that ? Because you 're one of us ? Because I 'm the only one who really cares if you 're alive or not , Pete . Come with me , okay ? And I promise you 'll be treated well . Don 't do this , Nathan . It 's okay . Ma , please . You have my word . I know you 'll take care of me . I will . Because you love me . Pete , I 'm just trying to help . Yeah . Goodbye , Nathan . Pete ! No , Nathan , don 't . You give me one good reason why I shouldn 't go after him right now . Because the game has changed . I 've seen it . And you need to be ready . NEWSCASTER : And we have some breaking news for you now . Rumors have surfaced that the US government has recently broadened the reach of the Patriot Act . Thanks , Brian . Well , tonight , sources have provided our news bureau some startling footage taken directly from an unnamed government agency right here in Washington . Now , this video shows American citizens in hoods and restraints in what appears to be a clear violation of their constitutional rights . Is the government running a secret military organization with the authority to disregard ... LUKE : So , what ? We 're just gonna stay here all day ? Look , the guy 's an ass , plain and simple , all right ? I told you parents suck . He killed my mother . ( SIGHING ) I 'm sorry . I didn 't know . I mean , I 've been trying to tell you that he 's a jerk , but ... You 've been trying to tell me ? Really ? When did that happen ? 'Cause all I can remember is the cute little stories of you two bird-watching around the neighborhood . You made him sound like Mr. Freaking Rogers . I was just waiting for the right time ... ( GROANING ) Hey , I got an idea . Why don 't we drive up to Canada ? Because we 're close to the border and we can rob some old ladies . That 's not gonna happen . Why are you doing this to me ? Because you 're here and I need to express my feelings . You used me for some joyride , an escape . I got news for you , kid . There is no escape . There 's only pain . And you can never outrun it , no matter what you do , no matter where you go . ( GRUNTING ) Go home to your mother , Luke . You 're not gonna kill me ? Seems a little on the nose . Wait . Where are you going ? To find my father . Because now that I 've seen the truth , I want him to die . Wait . What are you doing ? You must 've realized there 'd be consequences for your actions . Yeah , when that story breaks , you 're exposed , and the world will see what you 're doing . You 're hunting innocent people . You 're not innocent . The world just doesn 't realize how dangerous you are . Now they will , and they 'll beg me to hunt you down and kill you . The enemy has a face , Parkman . It 's you . No . No , I don 't want to hurt anyone . Really ? To me , you look exactly like a terrorist . ( MATT GRUNTING ) What did you ... ( MATT PANTING ) You gonna miss having a cute guy in your closet ? A little . You were incredible . Nice to know I still have a few tricks up my sleeve . I love you . I love you just the way you are . I wouldn 't trade this life for anything . Me neither . So , I made popcorn . Figured we could watch a movie , some sappy love story . Sounds perfect . I 'll be right down . ( GASPS ) Hey , Barbie . You ! I got a message from someone named Rebel . I need your help , Barbie .

 - previously on heroes : We have a problem with Sylar . He 's gone . Nathan , what are you- - Hey . I think i 'm in trouble , Pete . Ever think that we can just live , Noah , - Out in the open ? - No . - I 'm a friend , tracy . - What is this place ? Home , please take this . To find your way back here . I pushed Nathan 's memories into your mind . I made your body think that it was him . I 've gotta go find nathan . Get my body back . Then I kill every single person even remotely involved . Police , freeze . What the hell are you doing ? I 'm crossing that line . You idiot , you 'll die with me . I know . - [ grunts ] - Gun . [ police siren blaring ] - Where is Charlie ? I 'm the only one ... Who knows exactly where your sweet Charlie is . And you can save her , But only if you do exactly what I ask you to do . I made a mistake about eight weeks ago . [ grunts ] This green earth has given us so much . Feels good to give back what we can . Then why don 't you give back Charlie ? You 're an evil man , butterfly man . You must release Charlie From wherever you 're holding her . I have a way for you to earn her freedom . I met a man eight weeks ago . He had something I wanted ... A film from 1961 . His name was mohinder suresh . I know Dr. Suresh . I don 't need to time travel . I can find him right now . Dr. Suresh is dead . You killed Dr. Suresh . I need you to go back eight weeks , Hiro , To a motel room in Texas . - To save his life ? - No , to save that film Before he destroyed it . Once you return , deliver it to me , Your sweet Charlie will be set free . I don 't know if I can even time travel anymore . Then you 're gonna have to try very , very hard . Your sweet Charlie 's life depends on it . - Samuel . - Yeah . - We 're done here . - Let 's go . [ grunts ] So India was connected to Australia ? Mm-hmm . As well as Madagascar and most of Southern Africa . Now together , they made a super-continent Called Pangaea . That is until India broke off and began to migrate north . Everything keeps changing , doesn 't it ? Indeed . Come on . One of the great lessons of plate tectonics Is that all things are subject to evolution , Even the earth beneath our feet . Remember to read chapter six before class . Thank you , Dr. Suresh . Your students adore you , Mohinder . Teaching is what you were born to do . It does feel good to be back in the classroom again . Listen , I was thinking of making lamb biryani For dinner tonight . You promised you were going to throw this away . I am . it was delivered over a month ago . I assumed you meant immediately . look , it 's all of my father 's work From coyote sands in the ' 60s . And I didn 't mean to lie to you . It 's just hard to let go . we have a good life , Mohinder . A good , simple life here . Every time you dig into your father 's research , You disappear into a rabbit hole . It only leads you to a dark place . Perhaps you 're right . You doing okay ? You 've been sitting here staring at that poster For two hours . You ever wonder what it would be like Running off and joining a carnival ? Oh , yeah . that 'd be a dream come true . Living with a bunch of fire-breathing freaks . just because they 're different doesn 't make them freaks . Well seriously , Can you imagine spending your life in some trailer Moving from town to town ? and you spend your life where , in some crappy diner ? I 'm sorry . are you sure you 're okay ? Yeah . I 'm great . I 'm fantastic . Oh , my god . I 'm sorry if something 's going on , we 'll figure it out . Hey , it 's not like I lost my car keys . I lost a week of my life . Yeah , and you woke up in a carnival . You sure you wanna remember that ? Yeah . Senator Petrelli , welcome back . It 's good to be back . Elizabeth , do me a favor . Will you get my schedule out of the front office , please ? Sure . That was awfully casual . Yeah . I 'm telling you , Pete . it doesn 't make any sense . What 's that ? Even if my lost weekend was just some crazy bender Under the big top , A senator going off the grid . That ought to raise one or two alarms , Don 't you think ? Mom say anything when you talked to her ? She 's in Washington , wants to meet us here . What are you thinking ? Talk to me . I thought I had a handle on this , Pete . But these last few weeks , it 's just been like I don 't know who I am anymore . Just the last guy I figured for an identity crisis , Nathan . [ exhales sharply ] [ knocking on door ] Senator ? Go ahead . The good news is your day 's wide open . We cleared your calendar when you went on vacation . Vacation ? Sir , your mother said you weren 't sure How long you 'd be gone , so ... My mother . Right . Thank you . Deja vu . Oh ! so sorry , you startled me . Uh , can I help you ? Rene ? It 's okay . Did my mother send you ? don 't come any closer . I 've come here to speak with Peter . Okay . It 's okay. come on . What are you doing here ? I came to warn you , Peter . You need to know the truth . - Freeze ! - Claire . Claire . It 's me , Tracy Strauss . And you are breaking and entering In my dad 's apartment because ? I really need to see him . [ sighs ] Yeah , well , that 's why god invented doorbells . I didn 't mean to . I put my hand on the doorknob and it just ... Look , do you know where he is ? Something is going wrong with my power . I can 't control it . I didn 't know where else to go . Tracy , you 're freezing . So this was my mother 's idea to clean up Nathan 's mess . She sends you to wipe out our memories . It 's what she wants me to do , But I cannot do it . okay , and why is that ? your mother is blinded by her emotions . There are some lines that should never be crossed . why do you keep looking at him ? it is not up to me to reveal this thing . The decision must be yours . The answer you seek is here . If you go , Peter , Go alone . What you discover may be more terrible than you can bear . This is Dr. Chandra Suresh . And this is entry number four , Coyote sands relocation center , march 5 , 1961 . I 've been trying to alert the authorities here To the potential danger of gathering so many persons With abilities in one location . My concern centers around an apparent force- - Small , but measurable- - That emanates from all such individuals . When two or more of these forces are proximate , They amplify , exponentially , Like a kind of gravity or magnetism . An abnormal spike in seismic activity as of late Appears to be emanating from one of the individuals Being held here . A pregnant woman by the name of- - [ violent tremors ] This is entry number 21 . It is my intention to document the birth of the child . There has been an enormous release Of seismic activity throughout the day . Doctor , he 's crowning ! I fear that this child may indeed- - [ tremors resume ] I 'm coming ! it 's okay ! It 's okay . [ baby crying ] It 's okay , don 't worry . nurse ! [ shivering ] You okay ? [ shivering slows down ] That 's better . Why is this happening to me ? [ teapot whistling ] I thought it would be a good idea To make you some tea . You sure you 're okay ? Thanks , Claire . [ whistling continues ] [ sighs ] What happened ? The water started to freeze . It is happening over and over again , And I can 't stop it . Tracy , just calm down . Try to take a deep breath . Oh , no . Claire . Can you hear me ? Oh , my god . 106 . I really thought we were done With this cloak and dagger stuff . I still can 't figure out why the haitian Didn 't want me in the loop . Well , does it matter now ? This just gets better and better . [ metal bangs ] - Check it out . - Yeah . - Are we good ? - Good . - What do you got ? - It 's a body . What is it ? It 's me . That 's not you . could be , uh ... A shape-shifter or something , it 's not- - There 's got to be a reason The Haitian wanted you to see this . This is just weird . - Don 't- - - Sorry . You 're now Nathan Petrelli . What did you see ? Bits and pieces of things . a hotel room . Sylar . Sylar , that 's old news . that guy 's been dead for weeks . I know . I know . I heard ... Parkman . Matt ? His voice , he was angry . Whatever 's going on , we 're not gonna get Any straight answers out of mom or the haitian . - Okay , so we gotta find matt . - Where is he ? - L.A. - Let 's go find him . You sure ? I 'm not sure of anything . I gotta get you in the bath . Gotta get you in . [ screams ] [ crying ] - Tracy . [ gasps ] No , I heal . I heal . It 's , like , what I do . [ chuckles sheepishly ] Okay ? [ both laughing ] You think you ever really know somebody ? God , are you hearing yourself ? Yeah . Okay , you know what i see when i look at all this ? I see the big brother that would let me win by a nose When we would race . I see the naval officer who would rearrange his leave So that I could have a good birthday . And the past couple years , I 've seen the guy that 's saved my ass More than a few times . - I made a lot of mistakes . - So have I. Don 't beat yourself up over it . - Senator Petrelli . - Yeah . I found something . I just hope this isn 't The Matt Parkman you 're looking for . He 's in a hospital in Texas under guard . They 're saying he tried to commit suicide by cop . Thank you , Elizabeth . Multiple gunshot wounds . Yeah . He 's in critical condition . You know , Nathan , I can heal people now . If we could get in , I think I can save him . Hiro . tick tock , tick tock . I 'm trying . you can do this , Hiro . I have faith in you . Mohinder ? Mira . I 've made a remarkable discovery . There 's a power , an actual quantifiable force- - You promised me , Mohinder . No , Mira , this is important . Using my father 's equations , I built a device , A sort of compass that I can use to- - Will you listen to yourself ? You 're possessed again by these voices in your head . Mira , you don 't understand . By following this compass- - If the child on that film is still alive And surrounds himself with a large enough number Of specials , he can become the most pow- - Stop . I 'm begging you , Mohinder . Please think very carefully about what you have , About what you have to lose . I love you . But if you disappear again , I will not wait for you to return . Can you help him ? I can try . [ gasping ] Matt . You 're okay . [ coughing ] You 're okay . it 's me , Peter . - What happened ? - You 're okay . Good things do come to those who wait . Son of a bitch , get out of my head . You 're in the hospital , I brought you back . No , you don 't understand . This is exactly what he wants . What 's he talking about ? Bring him closer , Parkman . One touch is all I need . Then you can have your miserable life back . I can have my body back . Shut up ! you guys , run . Get away from me before he comes back . - Before who comes back ? - Sylar . - Sylar 's dead , Matt . - No , he 's in my head . He 's trying to con- - control my mind . I know this sounds crazy , but if he controls me , If he gets my power , he 's gonna jump back into his body . Whoa , whoa , whoa . slow down , Matt . What do you mean , " his body " ? This should be good . Nathan , you 're- - you 're dead . Sylar murdered you , he cut your throat . I used my power to purge his mind from his body And put your thoughts in . You 're weakening , Parkman . I 'm not gonna let you do this . I don 't have time for all the five stages of grief . Let 's go right from denial to acceptance . [ grunting ] [ gagging ] Oh , my- - oh , my god , you son of a bitch . Nathan . It 's true . No , no , no . I 'm so sorry . - Stay back . - You 're saying I 'm Sylar ? Yes . But I can make it all right . All you need to do is take my hand . All you need to do is take my hand . - Don 't. don 't take his hand . - It all makes sense , pete . - Nathan , get away from him . - Stop ! It all adds up . These new powers aren 't mine . - Stop . - They 're Sylar 's . I don 't exist . Doesn 't make sense . I don 't buy that . Take my hand , Nathan . He 's controlling you ! - Take my hand now . - No ! no ! Do it , take my hand . I 'll kill you first . Nathan , no ! It 's okay , Pete . matt 's right . It 's time to end it . One touch , Nathan . and it 's over . No , don 't touch him . You touch him , he 's got my power . His mind 'll go back into his body . Stop. stop ! You . back away from the prisoner . Take my hand , do it now . I said , get away . Back away ! No ! no . Nathan , where is he ? Nathan , where is he ? Pete , come here . We gotta get out of here . No ! Nathan ! Nathan , is he in you ? You son of a bitch , is he in you ? They 're in here ! Can I help you with something ? I hope so . I 'm looking for someone who may or may not even exist . If he does , his name would be Samuel Sullivan . I 'm Joseph Sullivan , proprietor . The man you are looking for is my brother . Come with me . If my evidence is correct , Your brother may be capable of magnifying his powers Simply by being near others with abilities . Powers , abilities . I 'd like to help you , doctor . But I 'm afraid I have no idea what you 're talking about . I thought you were going to build a fire . Figured , uh , Edgar and Damian could handle that . I 'm Samuel . Samuel Sullivan ? Dr. Suresh here has a few questions for me . He 's writing a book on the life of traveling carnies . People wanna read a thing like that ? It 's a colorful and exotic world . Why don 't you join the others at the fire pit . I 'm sure they could use your help . Yeah , of course . I 've just traveled 8,000 miles To speak with your brother . If you 're gonna try and stop me , You 'd better have a damn good reason . Please. come inside . [ catching breath ] Oh , uh , when you came in the room , I was already dead . You don 't remember seeing anyone else in that room . You took me to the morgue . And that 's all you remember . Oh , and do me a favor . take off all your clothes . Oh , let me give you my clothes . Yeah , good idea . Hurry up , let 's go , let 's go . come on . [ grunts ] Why are we here , nathan ? I shouldn 't be around people right now . Something happened to me out there , Pete . What ? I nearly put you through a wall With a flick of my hand . If Sylar gets into my head The way he got into Parkman 's ... I can 't risk that with you . There 's a road around here somewhere . You 'll find your way home . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Go ahead . I 'll be right behind you . The images on that film leave little doubt . The destruction your brother is capable of cannot be- - I am well aware of what he 's capable of . But Samuel himself has no idea . And it 's been my life 's work to keep it that way , To keep him in the dark about the true nature Of his power . Soon after our release from internment at Coyote Sands , My mother told me the truth about Samuel . You saw it on film . My mother lived it . She knew exactly how dangerous he could become . I 've kept our community small in number To ensure Samuel 's power remains subdued . I love my brother . But he 's become a man of great ambition . Somewhere inside , he can taste it , The immense potential he was born with . Under the right circumstances , Your brother 's powers could increase a thousand-fold . The information on that film- - Burn the film ! Go back to India . We must do everything possible To keep this genie in a bottle . How do I know I can trust you ? I have watched over him for 40 years , And everything 's been just fine . You 're no longer welcome here . [ door slams ] Mira , it 's me . You were right . This was all a mistake . I should have left that film in the trash . I should have left that box unopened . I miss you . I 'll be on the next plane home . Be careful , Dr. Suresh . Evil butterfly man will be coming for you . You know , you have not lost control Of your abilities in over an hour . Whatever 's happening with you , I don 't think it 's physical . It 's psychological . Great . I panic attack with powers . [ laughs ] When did it start ? Just this morning . I was sitting in this diner thinking about ... About what ? About changing everything . My entire life . I 've been so lost , claire . I tried so hard to put my old life back together , But once I did , nothing fit anymore . Then I met this strange man named Samuel . He lives with a group of people- - Who all have abilities . Yeah , I met him too . He invited me to join them , To move to this place where we 're all accepted . I think I might do it . Give up everything . Just start a new life . Maybe you should . Maybe that 's what your body is telling you it wants . It 's great to have someone to talk to about all this . It 's hard to find a friend out there in the normal world . Someone you can trust . Yeah . I had something like that , But I 'm pretty sure that 's over . Oh , it just sounded so good on paper , College . Now i 'm starting to wonder if- - It 's hard out there For girls like us . [ door creaking open ] Ladies . How was your day ? Oh , you know . Same old same old . [ exhales forcefully ] I need to know what was on that film . It 's about my ability , isn 't it ? A way for me to increase my power a thousand-fold . [ chuckles ] Tell me ! Your brother warned me about you . After all these years , he 's been betraying me ? Holding me back so that he could keep Playing the king . This is your last chance . Tell me what 's on that film . Never . I will learn the truth . and I will do everything I can to stop you . I 'm sorry . [ gasping , coughing ] Hiro ? Hello , old friend . I am not the Hiro Nakamura you know . I have come eight weeks from the future . - To save my life ? - No . To save this film . In the future I come from , you were dead . I was murdered right here in this room . How did you know I would need that Kevlar vest ? My time travel is not so good lately . The first time I tried , I arrived ten minutes from now . Wasn 't pretty . If I hadn 't gone right to Samuel , He would have never known the secrets of his power . My investigation has corrupted him . We have to stop him , Hiro . And we will . But first , you have to disappear For eight more weeks until he releases Charlie . Charlie ? Yes . Samuel is holding captive the woman I love Until I deliver this film . Hiro , this man is extremely dangerous . I can 't just go away for eight weeks While he consolidates his power . Please . If he knew I spared your life , He will never release Charlie . I understand your concern , And I appreciate all that you 've done for me . But our primary focus must be stopping Samuel . I will not risk Charlie 's life . Well then , we 'll have to agree to disagree , Hiro . If you will not disappear until Charlie is safe , Then I will have to make you disappear . What do you mean ? Sorry . He used to say , " put your finger " in a bucket of water , pull it out , And see how fast that hole fills up . " [ laughter ] Thanks a lot . thanks a lot . [ chuckles ] Your have your film . Now I want Charlie . Soon . Sorry your friend had to die . Mr. Ahmadi , Time for your medication . My name is Mohinder Suresh . My name is Mohinder- - Yes . Janice , honey , it 's me . Look , this is tough to explain into a machine . Remember I told you there was a guy inside my head Taking control of my mind , a monster named Sylar ? Well , I just want to let you know The craziness over the last few weeks is finally over . And , uh , Sylar 's gone . He 's gone back into his own body . I think he got what he wanted . I 'm not really sure what I 'm doing here . Not even sure I hope to find a- - I just know that I can 't go on living my old life anymore . I 'm glad you called , Tracy . I 'd hoped you would . I felt a real connection between us . There 's something I 'm gonna ask of you . A way for you to use your gifts To help make this a better world for all people Of abilities . Together , we can accomplish great things . You have unique talents , Tracy . Nathan , this , uh , This idea , this thought that you 're- - Sylar . Yeah . Change the voice , chance the face , Still him underneath . These hands have killed dozens of people , pete . Friends of ours . Who ever Nathan Petrelli was , he 's gone now . Just some random thoughts in a mass murderer 's head . Okay , look , assuming that I believe any of that , What would it matter ? I mean , didn 't matt say that he forced Sylar out ? You really think Matt could purge Every sick thought from that head ? To the rest of the world , I 'm Nathan Petrelli , Pete . But every time you look at me , The way you 're looking at me right now , You 're gonna see Sylar . Tell me I 'm wrong . Tell me I 'm wrong , Pete .

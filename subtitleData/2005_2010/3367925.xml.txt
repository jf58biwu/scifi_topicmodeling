 Torchwood Outside the Government , beyond the police . Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race . The 21st century is when everything changes ... and Torchwood is ready . My name is Dr. Owen Harper , and this is my life . A life that is full of action and violence and work , and wonder . And secrets , and sex , and love , and heartbreak . And death ... my death . The death I survived , the death I am now living through . Except ... this isn 't living . Every day it 's the same . I get up , get ready for work the same as everyone else . The thing is , I 'm not the same . I get to work and everyone 's doing the same old thing . Babbling away about aliens and weddings . I 'm not real . Three days ago , I died . And they think I 'm fine , but they 're wrong . So , are you ready to jump ? Would you just piss off . Get off my roof . Your roof ? I 'm going to jump , so just leave me alone . Look , darlin ' , you know , I 'm not here to stop you . Seriously . You think you 've got problems ? What , did your man dump you ? Sorry , love , were you talking to me ? It 's just , you know , I 'm a bit busy right now . I 'm not really interested in listening ... What is that ? I got shot . Yeah , right . Oh , my God , what the hell are you ? I 'm dead . That 's not ... look , you can 't be dead . You 're standing here . You 're talking . You 're moving . You 're not dead . You 're ... you 're dead ? Yeah , I was brought back ... like Jesus really , uh , but without the beard , you know ? Shit , I 'm never gonna have a beard . Not that I wanted one you understand , but you know , one day I- - Yeah , okay . Okay . You 're dead and that 's ... that 's clearly a bit shit and I 'm sorry and everything but , if you are dead , then why are you here ? You can 't be wanting to jump . You can 't die twice . Sorry , are you an expert ? Sorry , are you an idiot ? Yeah . I 'm a dead idiot . So , come on then , what 's it like ? What ? Well , being dead . What delights have I got to look forward to ? Darkness . Nothing . Cheery , thanks . Look , why are you here ? Dr. Owen Harper , Torchwood officer 565 , I 'm relieving you of your position . Bollocks . I 'm sorry , Jack , this is bollocks . Hand in your weapon and your security pass . But why ? I 'm fine . Three days ago , you died . We need to examine you . We need to find out what you are . We need to be certain you 're okay . Yeah , well it almost sounds as if you care , well done . Until I 'm confident you 're fit for duty , Martha Jones will replace you as Torchwood 's new medical officer . She 's doing all right out of this , isn 't she ? She 's worked out a series of tests and examinations . And what if I refuse ? You 'll be confined to the cells , tested and if the results show that you 're a danger to the team , appropriate steps will be taken . I 'm asking you , Owen . Please , let us help you . Let us make sure you 're safe . I 'm gonna need your gun . And your security pass . Please ... And how long are Dr. Jones' tests going to take ? As long as they need to . And what the hell am I supposed to do in the meantime ? We always need someone to make coffee . Oh , no . Voila . Fresh and strong . And , we couldn 't just have a jar of instant , no ? I thought you liked your coffee ? Have you seen what happens when I drink , these days ? Yeah . Thank you , Owen . You want to go ? Ooh , please . What 's wrong with this ? You okay ? What do you think ? I bet you 're loving this , aren 't you ? It 's like you 've finally won . I didn 't realise we were in competition . Oh , come on ! Even Tosh had more of a life than you used to . And now you 're always out on missions , you 're shagging Jack , and I 'm stuck here making the coffee . It 's not like that , me and Jack . You and Jack . Gwen 's getting married . Martha 's got her bloke . God , even Tosh had Tommy . This is really shit ! We 've all gone through shit , I 've seen you dissect alien corpses , I 've seen you save so many lives , are you really going to let this beat you ? So , you 're choosing me over the boyfriend ? Yeah , that 's it . You really don 't need to worry , you know , I don 't want your job . Yes , I know . You just find me irresistible . Oh , yeah , that 's it . Every morning I wake up and think of ways to get you alone like this . There is no sign of any muscle decay . You 're in great shape , as ever . Hmm , no use coming onto me , Jones . I 'm a changed man . And , erm , no stiffening anywhere ? Well ... Just answer the question . No , no signs of rigor mortis . So , if I keep up the exercise , I won 't atrophy ? Yep . And a bonus , definitely looks like you 're not going to age either . There 's no further sign of cell mutation . You 're 100 % human . 100 % Owen . Hi , Martha . Meeting in the boardroom . Can you come down ? You 'd better go , doctor . What about you ? Cappuccino with chocolate sprinkles . What ? That 's what you drink , isn 't it ? Henry John Parker , he used to be a looker , now he 's 80-odd and even I have my limits . Your basic millionaire collector of alien hoo-hah . And we fall in with the " mostly harmless " category ? So , what 's the problem ? I detected this at 0517 this morning . Parker 's house . There 's an energy spike coming from it . I 've never seen anything like it before . Okay , so , the big question is , what 's our Mr. Parker gone and found this time ? Why ? Do you think he 's a threat ? Well , he hasn 't been up until now . He 's a bit Howard Hughes . We know he 's there , we know he 's not a threat . But as the story goes , he hasn 't left the house since his wife died . Nobody 's seen him since 1986 . We 've been monitoring Parker for ages . There 's nothing to be scared of is there ? Unlike , say , Tintin ? Okay . I never liked Tintin . What , he 's weird . He 's got a funny face and his hair is just , is horrible . - I always loved Tintin . - Yeah , well you would . And he never had a girlfriend did he , just the dog , so I reckon he was actually shagging the dog . Okay , meanwhile , back at Torchwood . Alien energy pulse . We 've got to check this Parker out , okay ? Tosh , can you get me a complete schematic of the house . Ianto , find out exactly what he 's got . Get me an inventory of everything that he 's bought for the last 10 years . Martha , can you get a hold of his medical history ? - Sure . - Okay , let 's get to it , guys . Hey , Gwen , any news on Banana Boat ? Can you believe it ? Best Man , arrested in Lanzarote . - What for ? - Ah , dodgy CDs . Worldwide , nearly a million people kill themselves each year . That 's almost three times the population of Cardiff . - Makes you think . - What are you ? - Some sort of suicide geek ? - No , just a doctor . Infact , I 'm not just a doctor . I 'm a bloody brilliant doctor . I know you are . So why are you doing my job ? - Because Gwen asked me to . - That 's not what I mean . Because you died , and because you need help . That 's not a bad thing . It is a bad thing that you died obviously , but it 's not bad that you need help , if you know what I mean ? You 're kinda cute when you babble . And you 're kinda cute when you 're not chucking a scalpel about . But I 'm making the sodding coffee ! I mean , come on , won 't your bloke be missing you ? Has he seen Jack ? They always get jealous when they meet Jack . Owen , I don 't want your job . I just want to do mine . Okay , I 'm dead , but I am 100 % human . I 'm fine . You 've sliced your hand open . The wound 's not going to heal , so , you 're going to have to re-stitch it every week or so . At least you don 't need anaesthetic . Yeah ... can 't feel anything . Can 't feel the needle or thread , can 't feel your hands on mine . Yet , I can touch things , I can hold ' em , I know they 're there . But I just can 't feel anything . I 'm numb . Do you see why Jack 's worried ? Bruises won 't heal . Bones won 't mend . You 're ... fragile . Yeah , well , I 'd better get used to doing things myself . So she offers to help you and you push her away ? Charming . Yeah , hole in the chest . Sorry if I don 't follow social niceties any more . You mean you did before ? God , you 're a pain in the arse , aren 't you ? Is that why your man dumped you ? Oh , I hit a nerve ? What , did you get your heart broken ? No , actually . He died . I 'm sorry . No you 're not . You couldn 't care less about me and I don 't care about you . Just because we 're both planning on jumping , it doesn 't mean we have some sort of special connection . You don 't know the half of it . Give me something to do . You know I can 't . Rules and regulations . Fine . I might as well go home then . Okay . What exactly do I do when I get there ? Watch TV ... chill . Jack , I 'm dead . I 'm permanently chilled . You know , you get to live forever . I get to die forever . It 's funny that . Oh , hello ! And welcome to " To Buy or Not to Buy " , the property show that lets you ... Do you mind if I eat , I 'm starving ? No , help yourself . So , Jack asked you to come round did he ? " Talk to Owen . Get him to open up , godammit ! " You haven 't changed , have you ? It 's all about Owen . I 've actually had a hell of a morning , you know ? - Do you have a .. ? - Top drawer . So , Jack calls me in at 5.00 this morning . He could have waited until I got in , but no , strange energy spike and it 's " Let 's get Tosh in . " Oh , and when Gwen got in , first thing she did ? Say sorry for not asking me to be bridesmaid . I mean , me , a bridesmaid ? You sound like an old married couple . Brian used to say I talked too much . Tell me about him . Today 's my wedding anniversary . My perfect day ... It was an accident . We 'd been married less than an hour . I was picking confetti out of my hair when it happend . - Shit . I 'm- - - Sorry , yeah . I know . You waited until your wedding anniversary to kill yourself ? - Why ? - Does it matter ? - Why have you waited ? - Because I believe people . I believe them when they said it would get better . So , what do you think , doctor ? Do you really think it 's going to get any better ? I ran it through the language translator - and it 's flipping Croatian- - - Why are you here , Tosh ? I want to help you . And how are you going to do that ? How are you going to help me ? I mean , am I going to be a new special project ? Come on , Owen , I just ... That 's not why you 're here is it ? For some reason you want me , you know I don 't know why , but you always have , you 're always looking at me , watching me screw other women , your heart breaking and now it 's different , because I 'm safe now , aren 't I ? And it 's all cosy and it 's romantic and isn 't it beautiful , you know ? You can say what you like . I 'm not leaving you . Well , of course you 're not . Because this is it , isn 't it ? This is the date that we were talking about . You 've got your beer , you 've got pizza , you and me , it 's just how you wanted it . All we need now is a sodding pool table . - Stop it ! What 's wrong with you ? - I 'm broken , Tosh ! I don 't work , I 've got no heartbeat , no feelings , no tears , I have got nothing to give you ! - I- - - Do you understand that ? Maybe that 's what you want , maybe you want somebody who 's as screwed up as you ! Who 's twisted and screwed up like you are . You want to see broken , do you want to see broken , Tosh ? Owen ! Stop it ! What are you doing ? ! 36 minutes . Not bad . You were watching ? Skinny guy in tight jeans runs into water ? I was taking pictures ! How long 's this going to go on for , Owen ? Ianto , what have you found out about Parker ? I 've identified some of the things he 's purchased over the past year . We 've got a Dogon eye . A pair of Myakian wings , meteorites . An Arcateenian translation of James Herbert 's " The Fog " . But there are a few things we 've never seen before . So one of these is causing the energy spikes ? Looks like it . And they 're getting bigger , dangerously bigger . Right , okay , we need to get in there . Parker employs a mr . Philip Farrington to run security . There 's at least six guards , CCTV everywhere , all of which we can bring down by taking out the generator , but then there 's these ... Heat sensors . - As in body heat ? - Yep . Solar-powered . There 's one on every doorway , every window . So , how do we get past them ? Sounds like you need a dead man . Someone with no body heat . What have you got to lose ? Tosh ? I turned your telly off . You screamed at her , you said all those things , and that 's it ? That 's Tosh . Always the professional . I don 't care ! I 'm not interested in you , in old men or alien meteors . I came here because my husband died . I just want to jump . - Let 's get on with it . - Get off me ! You , you 're too scared . Aren 't you ? How did ... how did you get from that to here ? What happened ? If you hurt yourself , you will not recover . Like I said , any bruises you get , they 're not gonna heal . Do not engage in physical combat . One punch you 're gone . Be careful . I understand , I 'm made of glass . Owen ? Just take care . Oh , and you 'll need this . Owen ? Yeah ... hi , Tosh . Okay , the power in the house is supplied from one private electrical generator . There 's a backup unit but take the main one down and you 've got 1 minute , 20 of blackout time . Can only get rid of one of the blokes , yet ? Might look suspicious with those two phone calls . Try and make it the big one , okay ? Arse ! - Hello ? - Mr. Taylor ? Yeah , that 's right , who 's this ? I 'm calling from St. Helen 's Hospital . Mrs. Christine Taylor was brought in an hour ago . She 's been involved in a car accident . Is she hurt ? She 's going to be fine but she 's asking to see you . - Of course . I 'm on my way . - You all right ? It 's Chrissie , she 's been in an accident . Look , I 've got to go . Yeah , of course . Mr. Farrington ? Ben 's had to go . His wife 's been in an accident . Okay , guys , I 'm here . Move away from there . I said- - Yeah , okay , guys . Very funny . No , no , no . - Do you want to see what I can do ? - What ? I 'm dead already , mate . Webb to Dave , are you there ? 1 minute , 20 until the backup generator comes online . This is Farrington to all units . The backup generator will be running in 45 seconds . Stay at your posts , please . Mr. Parker 's personal generator is unaffected . Sorry , Owen , they 've obviously had some work done . Heat sensors . I am literally too cool for school . Right , I 'm in . Okay , the energy reading seems to be coming from the first floor . A room at the back of the house . Can you give me anything else ? No , the energy source is playing havoc with the system , sorry . No worries . I 'm getting used to being in the dark . Hold it there . Evenin ' . Nice place you 've got here . Love what you 've done with the pictures . Who are you ? Why aren 't the sensors picking you up ? Okay , stop . Stop or I 'll shoot . No , you won 't . You 're a security guard . Come on . That gun 's just for show , innit ? Do you know what a bullet does to a living person ? It 's not like a knife through butter , no , no , no , no . It rotates , tears into the flesh and the gooey stuff behind . Rips into the organs , and , ooh , it 's not nice . But anyway , I haven 't got any body heat , you must know what that means ? You can 't kill a dead man . What are you ? - I 'm wrong . - What are you ? ! I 'm broken . I 'm Dr. Owen Harper . And I 'm having one hell of a day . Yes ? It 's okay , mate . I 'm not going to hurt you . I 'm a doctor . You 're a very violent doctor . I 've been watching you . - Henry Parker , yeah ? - You 're Torchwood , yes ? - Did the American send you ? - Yeah , he sent me . How do you know so much about us ? They could 've sent that Japanese girl , I liked her . Yeah , well , I 'm sorry you got me . Is she on your phone thing ? - The earpiece ? - Yeah . Hello ! Just to say you 've got very lovely legs . You should show them off more . What 's wrong with you ? Three heart attacks and a failed bypass . But I 'm fine , because I have this . It 's called the Pulse . - You know what it is ? - I named it . It 's keeping me alive . No ! You 're not taking it . It could be dangerous . We 've been detecting massive energy readings . I don 't care . All I know is , it works . Well , I 'm sorry , it doesn 't . What ? The energy isn 't going into you . The power 'sjust building up inside that thing , that 's what we 've been detecting , but ... it isn 't actually doing anything for you . You 're wrong . I can feel it . - No , no . I 'm not going to die . - Please , listen to me . There are loads of peoples ' lives at risk . If that thing explodes then we don 't know what the fall-out will be . You 're young , you don 't understand what dying feels like . Believe me , I do . I really do . - There 's nothing there . - Where ? On the other side , nothing , I 'm dying . Take away my Pulse and I 'm gone . My body decomposing . You can 't stop it , Mr. Parker . I 'm sorry , but it 's going to happen one day . It 'll be dark and I 'll be alone . Where are you now ? It 's dark and you 're all alone , so what 's the difference ? I don 't understand what 's keeping me here . It 's hope . That thing , it 's just hope . Do you really think all this is better than death ? It 's got to be . It is better . You 're just scared of the darkness . Join the club . Trust me , I know how shit everything can be . Don 't you sit there pontificating , you 're just a boy , what do you know about anything ? I 've travelled the world . I fought in the war . Started my own business . I made a fortune . Married ... widowed . My collection , all of it . I 've done so much and this is where I ended up . Alone . Lying in my own piss ! And do you know what I want ? - Clean sheets ? - I want a steak . Medium rare . Black pepper sauce . Look at me . Fed through a tube . I might as well be dead already . I might as well be dead . Why don 't you take it ? Well ? Oh , Christ , it 's dark , I 'm alone , I 'm so alone . It 's all right , I 'm here with you . I 'm still stuck here , though . In this bed , in the dark . You know what ? I 'm going to come back . You and me . We 're going to face all of this together , I 'm going to help you . Torchwood , if you come back , you can tell me all about it . Tell me what it 's like . I want to hear about the aliens and everything ! I need to know that there 's more out there . That this isn 't all there is . Oh , come on , I 'm dying , who am I going to tell , the Angel Gabriel ? If you come back , I won 't tell the Japanese girl that you 're still holding my hand . Well , maybe . Mr. Parker ? Henry ? Henry ? I 'm so sorry . I couldn 't save him . He needed me to give him air , but I couldn 't . I 've got no breath . Everything I 've seen , everything that 's out there and it was an old man dying of a heart attack . It was just another person dying because of me . Everything that 's happened and that was the final straw . Because at that moment I just wanted it all to end . Owen . Owen , can you hear me ? Owen , come in ! Yeah , yeah , I 'm here . The device , is it doing anything ? Because the energy levels coming from it are ... Owen ? It 's going off the screen . It 's going to explode ! Tosh ? What can we do ? Nothing ! There 's nothing ! It 's okay . I 'm going to hold it . Owen , what are you doing ? See if I can absorb it . Owen , the energy reading 's off the scale . You won 't survive . Yeah , well , that 's okay . These things happen . There must be something we can do . - Martha , Martha ... - Owen ? If it destroys me , they 're going to need a new doctor . You 've got all the credentials . Medical skills , and a cracking arse . Jack ? If you even attempt to bring me back again . Gwen , Ianto , it was fun , mostly ... thank you . Tosh ? Tosh ? Come on , answer me . Owen . I 'm sorry . I love you . What happened ? We all assume life 's going to be shit , don 't we ? That it 's all just darkness . But you know what ? Sometimes , it 's not . What is it ? Do you remember in the ' 70s , NASA sent messages into space ? A map of our solar system , pictures of what we look like . It had images , voices , music . Even a bit of Chuck Berry . Well this is a reply , not that we know who from . Well , what does it do ? It sang to me . It 's a glimmer of light in the darkness . See ? Sometimes it does get better . Well , I 'm sorry , Dr. Jones . - No vacancies in Cardiff just yet . - That 's okay . I reckon you 're ... I was going to say fine , but you 're a hell of a lot more than that . Thank you . For everything . It 's what I 'm here for . You take care . Well , it 's been ... interesting . Oh , it 's been fun . You know it has . Well , everyone else has had a go . You can so come back any time ! Well , maybe I will . One day . Promise me something . - What 's that ? - No more locking it all away . You tell me when it 's bad . Share it with me . Okay ? Tosh , I 'm scared . I 'm scared that if I close my eyes I 'll get trapped , in the darkness . I 'm here . That 's when I saw you . I thought you came here to jump ? No ... I came here to help . - What do I do now ? - You 've got a choice . If you think that the darkness is too much then go for it . But if there is a chance , just some hope . It could be having a cigarette , or that first sip of hot tea on a cold morning , or it could be your mates . But if there 's even a tiny glimmer of light then don 't you think that 's worth taking a chance ? What 's your name ? Maggie . Maggie Hopley . Well , Maggie , it 's up to you . Your choice . Do you still want to jump ? My name is Owen Harper , and this is my life . Careful , Gwen . This thing eats people . - And what is that exactly ? - It 's a shapeshifter . With a taste for human flesh . You 're going to have to postpone the wedding . You 're pregnant ! An alien egg in your belly and it 's mother coming to rip you open . That is all we need . In five hours , I 'm walking down the aisle . You are not thinking straight ! All I want to do today is marry you . That 's the problem with shapeshifters . I 'm not an alien ! You never know what you 're looking at .

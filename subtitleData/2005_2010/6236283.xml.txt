 " Destiny " ... The design is clearly ancient , Launched hundreds of thousands of years ago . Where the hell are we ? Several billion light-years from home . We 're on a ship , But we have no idea where we are , In relation to earth . This ship could be the most important discovery Mankind has made since the Stargate itself . These are the wrong people in the wrong place ... We 've got a lot of wounded , and we need to get home . We barely have enough power to operate the main systems . This ship simply doesn 't have the capability to dial earth . We 've got a problem . One of the air vents just shut down in here . Our first priority must be to seal off any of the leaks . We can maybe buy ourselves a day or so before the build-up of CO2 kills us . We can 't ask someone to sacrifice themselves , Period ! Dad ! No ! Wait ! It looks like we 've dropped out of ftl . RUSH : The ship detected a stargate on a planet within range that may have what we need . What we need 's on the other side of that wormhole . Hot . Cool . SCOTT : Make sure we can dial back to the ship . FRANKLIN : Already on it . - PALMER : Looks like gypsum . - That would be good . Why ? - We 're looking for calcium carbonate . - RUSH : Calcite . Gypsum is calcium sulfate , which is 36 % calcium carbonate . ELI : Hmm . Huh . It dissolves . Are you saying we can use this sand to fix the scrubbers ? - That would be convenient . - PALMER : No . RUSH : Well , it 's a fair indication that the components may exist nearby . PALMER : For the sake of portability and efficiency , I 'm hoping to find high-concentration granular limestone . We are looking for the dried lake bed or salt-water body all this sand came from . It 's a desert . Lime is formed mostly from the remains of marine organisms . - Huh . - Are you saying there was life here ? RUSH : Not likely anything we 've seen before . Yeah , the water may be gone now , but this desert was formed by H20 evaporating on a playa floor , causing gypsum to be deposited in a fine crystalline form called selenite . - Where are you going ? - Higher ground . Is that supposed to happen ? PALMER : If this sand is high enough in calcite concentration , the solution would absorb the acid . - Right . - The liquid would turn clear . It 's not . We 're good ! This is Scott . Unfortunately , there 's nothing useful in the immediate vicinity of the gate . YOUNG : You have 12 hours , Lieutenant . Make them count . Copy that . We 're moving out ! Too bad we can 't just use this sand . There certainly is enough of it . STARGATE UNIVERSE : " Air pt.3 " Season 1 Episode 3 I 'm fine . No , you 're not , and neither am I , but we 're ... We 're still alive because of what he did . - Look , for what it 's worth ... - Well , it 's worth a lot . You know , as long as we 're still here , I promise you ... Colonel , I 've edited enough of my father 's speeches to know what you 're going to say . You don 't have a clue what I was going to say , because I don 't . We ... We brought along an Ancient device . Communication stones . - They allow us to ... - Yeah , I know what they are . Good . Well , I 'm about to use one of them to report to my superiors on Earth , tell them our situation . I want to tell her myself . You 've been sitting here since Rush made contact . Let somebody else take a shift . I 'm not leaving this chair . I 've been on this project for the last six months , and I 'll be damned if ... Colonel ? This is strange . MEHTA : Dr. Rush , is that you ? No , it 's Colonel Young . I need you to put me in a room with General O 'Neill . I 'm going to need you , too . JOHANSEN : Sir , I told you not to get up . TELFORD : What did he do to himself ? He 's got cracked ribs , more bruises than I can count and a concussion that resulted in neuropraxia . - Oh , that 's just great . - Chloe ? - Dr. Mehta . - Can you help me , please ? You know , I had some of my favorite arguments with your father . Are you saying you won some ? Depends on who you ask . Listen , Major Green 'll be escorting you to see your mother . - Please give her my condolences . - Thank you . Yeah . So , how is it going out there really ? I don 't know what Rush has told you . We may not have much time left . The ship 's very old . It 's falling apart . - Fix it . - We 're trying . Even if we can get the life support working , we don 't have much food and water . - Then go get some . - We 're not supposed to be there , sir . These are the wrong people in the wrong place , and as a group , they 're just not qualified . Oh , please . I wasn 't qualified to lead that first team through the stargate ... - I understand that , sir . - In the past dozen years or so , we 've sent hundreds of teams through that thing ... And I think the bottom line is , none of us are qualified . I just think we 're going to get to a point very soon where everyone onboard should get a chance to say goodbye . Understood . Save it . FRANKLIN : That 's not very smart . Temperatures like these , the human body needs at least ... GREER : Walk , don 't talk . Just FYI , he 's right about the whole human body and water ... - Eli ! - Walk , don 't ... Oh . Look . More sand . FRANKLIN : This is pointless . We should go back . PALMER : We just got here . I still think we should be checking out the other planets in range of the ship . RUSH : I still think you 're wrong . The solution 's here . ELI : I know . It was a mirage , but when we were walking over that last dune , I thought I saw the Statue of Liberty sticking half out of the sand . Just for a second there . I was all ready to yell , " Damn you ! " " Damn you all to hell ! " Oh , come on . That was funny . Was it ? Because it would mean we were really on Earth , but in the future , and the apes had taken over and then buried the Statue of Liberty for some reason . Eli ? Have a drink . Greer , hold up ! Hold up ! - This isn 't going to work . - GREER : Not if we keep stopping . I 'm saying we need to split up . Fine with me . I agree . Franklin , you should come with me . Nah . No , no , no , you 're with me and Greer . Sun 's been moving that way , we 'll call it west . Eli , Franklin , Palmer , and Curtis , you head that way . We 'll test every 20 minutes or so . After two hours , you head southeast . That should take you back in the direction of the gate . Whoa , wait a second . Do we really think that splitting up is the best idea ? I say we head straight back . There 's no point in crossing over the same territory we 've just crossed . Or we could just stick together . Look , Matt , I 'm sorry . I just have this really , really sick feeling that you 're going to go that way , and we 're going to go this way . Eli , I need someone that I can trust to lead the second team , okay ? That is you . Curtis is a good soldier . He 's a tough guy . He 's not going to let anything happen to you . Truth is , I 'm slowing you down and you want to get rid of me . I 'm doing what I think will best accomplish this mission . You asked to come . I 'm telling you how you can help me . Now suck it up . Yeah . Okay . Okay , guys , we 're going this way . Move out ! SCOTT : Radio if you find the lake bed , we 'll double back . ELI : When you see the Statue of Liberty , you know what to say , right ? Right . Now we can make some time . She 's here ? Right now ? She 's here ? Right now ? - Yes , ma 'am , but as I 've explained ... - Chloe ! Mrs. Armstrong ... I know I look different and I sound different , but it 's me . Mom , please . I have something to tell you . Mom ... Stop ! I 'm sorry . It 's just ... The thought that you 're actually on some ship so far away , I can 't even imagine . - Mom ... - Just tell me you 're coming home . I don 't know . Mom , please ! The ship is old and damaged . We were losing air and somebody had to ... He 's dead . He 's dead , isn 't he ? MEHTA : Where is everyone ? Able bodies are searching the ship for anything that might have CO2 sequestration properties , and the rest are in crew quarters . Colonel , we were able to dial out to the planet again . JOHANSEN : Colonel Young and Chloe are using the communication stones . This is Colonel Telford , Dr. Mehta . Uh ... Right . Okay . Did you make radio contact with the off-world team ? Yes , nothing to report yet . They 've split up . How much time before the ship jumps back to FTL ? Roughly nine hours . Dial out every 20 minutes . Maintain regular contact . We do have power issues to be aware of . Dialing the gate is a significant drain on what seems to be limited resources at this point . The away mission is priority one right now . - Sir ? - I 'm fine . I understand that there are other stargates in range . Four other addresses came up in the system , but we seem to be locked out from here . Well , have you tried working around it ? Dr. Rush didn 't think that was a good idea . I think it makes sense to know what our options are , so do what you can . There has to be a good reason why these addresses are being disqualified . If I wasn 't being clear , I was giving you an order . If there are good reasons , find out exactly what they are . - Let 's keep moving , I want to see more . - You should rest . Lieutenant . Sir , Colonel Young 's body needs time to recover . TELFORD : Give me something for the pain . The body feels pain for a reason . I would rather not mask it . Just do it , Lieutenant . From the sound of things , you need my help here . All right , come on . Let 's go . You better save some of that . - We need to slow down . - We need to cover more ground . RUSH : It 's going to be impossible to maintain this pace on the way back . GREER : Maybe for you . How tedious . Little boys playing soldier . Well , I 'm sorry . I 've no interest in playing your game . I 'm not playing anything , I 'm trying to save the lives of everyone aboard that ship . If we continue this pace , we 're going to die out here . Yeah , maybe we will . Light years away from the admiring eyes of your father , or your drill sergeant , or whoever 's approval it is you so desperately seek . - How dare you ! - Get up and move . Hey , did you see that ? What ? I don 't know . Nothing . Let 's move . One hour . One hour , and then we start circling back . All right , fine . - Just hold that there . - Thank you . What did you ... That was supposed to be for the pain . What did you give to him ? A strong sedative , which we are desperately short on and I should not have had to use just so that Colonel Young can return to a body in working condition . You are out of line , Lieutenant . Disregarding the health of another human being is out of line . I am well within my rights as ranking medical officer . He 'll be out an hour or two . Well , what am I supposed to do ? I don 't care . I have other patients to attend to . Something wrong ? No , I 'm fine . Good a place as any to stop and test . - I take it that 's not good ? - No . I don 't know . I think that ... Hey , guys . Another negative over here . I 'll radio Scott and tell him we 're moving on . Uh , yeah , but that 's not what 's going down . - It 's not ? - No . There are four other viable addresses in this thing . I think I found an override that 'll allow us to dial from here ... - Yeah , but ... - Look around . This planet is a dead zone . - ELI : But ... - We should 've been trying to dial these other planets from the start . - Rush said ... - We don 't care what Rush said . We don 't trust him . Rush doesn 't want us all to die . That doesn 't mean we trust him to make the right decisions . You , too ? What about the lake bed ? It could be hundreds of miles from here . We could be blowing our only chance at finding a decent place to evac . Maybe the ship did bring us here because there 's lime on this planet . For all we know , the Ancients had a way of locating it that we don 't . For that matter , I 'm sure they could 've stopped the ship for longer than 12 hours to find it and recover it with the proper tools . The fact is , the Ancients wouldn 't have let the life-support system get that screwed up in the first place . Rush is set on fixing the ship . He 's deaf to any other logic . We need to find a planet we can survive on . This might be our last chance . Gotta keep going . Here . Take it . - I have my own . - No , no . I can 't go on . I 'm never going to make it back . I know it 's here . You have to find it . Take it . - We 're going to leave him here ? - I 'll make my way back to the gate . - Go with him . - I 'm not leaving you here alone . - Make sure he gets back alive . - What difference does it make ? Because if I don 't find what we need , he 's going to be the one to find some other way to save his own ass , and yours along with it . You 're losing it . I 'll be okay . ON RADIO : Scott , this is Eli . Come in . If you can hear me , please respond . This is Scott , what 's up ? We have a problem . Franklin , Curtis , and Palmer have given up and are headed back to the gate to try dialing the other addresses in the remote . They also have the Kino . They don 't think we 're going to find the lime here . They want to look for another planet that will support life . They 're going to get themselves killed . Don 't we need the remote to get back to the ship ? That 's not the point . A few hours is nowhere near enough time to determine whether a planet is even safe , let alone viable for sustaining life . The ship . The ship 's our only real hope of ever getting home . Stop them if you can . I 'll turn back when I have to . - Yes , sir . - Go ! You lead . I 'm sorry , excuse me . Miss Armstrong , we better be going soon . You get my daughter home . Everyone is doing the best they can , I assure you . That 's not good enough . Mom , it 's not his fault . I 'm a personal friend of the President and of the First Lady . - Yes , ma 'am . - You tell your superiors if anything happens to her , I will go public with what I know . Mom ... I 'm sorry , she 's upset . My husband gave his life for my daughter . You get her back to me , or the whole world is going to know what has really been going on these past years . - RUSH : I need water . - We 're almost there . I thought since I gave Scott my canteen , we 'd share . And you were wrong about that . I should 've known . Yeah ? You think you know me pretty well , don 't you ? I helped choose the personnel for Icarus Base . I read your file . And neither you nor Captain Marvel back there were on my list , I can tell you . You think I care ? Give me some water . Keep walking . You think just because you were born poor that it gives you the right to be angry at the world . - How pathetic . - Mmm , yeah , yeah . You think that 's why I 'm angry ? If it wasn 't for the army , you 'd be in jail , or worse . That 's what all you rich people think . Rich ? My father worked in the shipyards in Glasgow . I earned a scholarship to Oxford while I was working two jobs . I have earned the right to make decisions without explaining myself to you or anyone else . You give me some of that water ! Keep walking . You give me some of that water ! - Don 't you ever touch me . - Give me some ... And you do that again , and I 'm gonna put a bullet - in your face . - Oh , really ? I don 't think so . You need me . Otherwise , you 'd have gladly done it by now . Right now , I pray to the God above that dehydration will shut you the hell up . Walk ! Or die here ! It 's your choice , Mr. Decision-maker . Looks like it 's worth a shot to me . Let 's do it . ELI : Wait ! Stop ! Look , it 's not perfect , but it 's better than here . Vegetation , water , air . It 's not too late for you to come with us . - Don 't go . - FRANKLIN : We 'll dial back when we know it 's safe to evacuate everyone . - ELI : You 'll never get back home . - You don 't know that . Maybe there 's a way we can use the gate system to connect the dots . There has to be a reason the ship locked out those addresses ! Don 't . Please . Shoot him ! Why did you do that ? He told me to . - I saved his life . - By shooting him ? He 'll live . You just stranded Curtis and Palmer . We 'll send them another remote . I wasn 't taking any chances . - Where 's Scott ? - RUSH : Still looking for limestone . ELI : It 's almost halftime . We only have six hours before the ship leaves . Lieutenant , this is Greer . Come in . I hope he 's turned back by now . Lieutenant ! Come in . You must keep going , my boy . Don 't give up . I don 't need you to tell me that . I 'm not going to let anyone else down the way I let you down . You really don 't have to follow me around to remind me . He has his plan for all of us . He 's either out of radio range or he 's lying face-down in the sand , dead , or soon to be . I 'm going back for him . - Well , that 's great . Suicide . - I 'm not leaving him out here . - I 'll go with you . - No , no , you 're just gonna slow me down . Look , this man has to get back to the ship . He needs medical attention . Dial . He can take Franklin back . You wait here for me . You have five hours to find him and get back here . Well , it 's not been a pleasure knowing you . - What do I need that for ? - Just in case . In case what ? I don 't even know how to fire this thing . You 'd better be here . I will . I have a gun . - Why do I feel like I 've been drugged ? - Oh . Good to have you back , sir . Son of a ... What the hell was Telford doing ? Well ... You 're going to need this . BRODY : There they are . RILEY : Hurry up , hurry up . Come on , help him , help him . BRODY : What happened ? Greer ... Greer shot him . Water . Water . Hey . That was my ration for the day . What 's going on ? Oh , we 've had a lovely day at the beach . How about you ? I have sinned , Father . I 've failed you . I 've failed him . I 've failed myself . We have redemption through his blood . Curtis ? Palmer ? This is Eli . If you can hear me , please come in . Curtis . Palmer . Please , respond . PRIEST : Do you love her ? - SCOTT : She 's not going to have it . - You 're certain ? She 's 16 . We barely even know each other . What are you going to do ? I don 't know about anything . I thought He was my calling . But now ... I am sorry . Why ? I 'm the one who 's weak . It 's my fault . No , it isn 't . It 's not yours . This is Scott ! Come in ! I found it . I found the lake bed ! I 've got the lime ! Oh , my God . If you can hear me , wait . Just wait , I 'm coming ! Eli . Which way ? Let 's move out . Scott ... Come on . Ready ? Drink . Come on , come on , come on , man . Take the bag . There 's no time ! - You have to take it . - Yes , you can . - No , I can 't make it . - Get the hell up ! Come on ! I can 't make it . I can 't carry you and this ! Get your weak ass up ! Come on ! Come on , soldier ! Less than three minutes before the ship jumps again . Incoming ! - I 'll stay . - It 's okay . I got it . - Sorry , sir . - You did your best . Less than one minute . I see them ! They 're carrying something ! GREER : We 've got it ! Don 't go ! We 've got it ! They 've got the lime ! And they 're not going to make it . Forty seconds . Give me the radio . Eli , I want you to stick your arm into the event horizon of the puddle . Seriously ? Are you sure ? No . But I 'm betting there 's some kind of safety protocol that prevents someone getting cut off en route . And what if there isn 't ? Twenty seconds . Eli , do it now ! Come on , man . Come on . Come on ! Five , four , three , two , one ! Eli , drink . YOUNG : Scott , look at me . Lieutenant , look at me . ♪ Look at me ! Look at me ♪ ♪ Well done , Eli .

 Come on ! Is she there ? Right down in front . It 's not their fault , you know . They just ... They don 't know what they 're doing . Guys , we should leave before we get caught . It 's happening . Don 't they ever get tired of this ? It 's so sick . Don 't worry , this will all change . And she 's gonna help change it . Come on ! Do it ! - Do it ! Come on ! Yeah . Come on . Go , Lindsay ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Damn it ! - What happened ? She derezzed . She flipped out or something . She must 've defaulted back to the last copy . I guess she 's not as strong as you yet . I have faith in you . She 'll be perfect , 'cause you 're perfect . Graystone . What a surprise . Go frak yourself , Caston . Are you okay ? Yeah . Anything happen after I left ? Some more blood and guts . I logged off a couple of minutes after you . So , did you check on our girl after she disappeared ? No . Frakkers confiscated my Holoband . I can access her from home . From home ? We 're not splitting for Gemenon until tomorrow . There 'll be plenty of time for tweakage . But , Zoe ... No buts . Not ever . For the one true God knows all and directs us all . So say we all . - So say we all . Out ! - What ? It was as out as can be . Do we need to turn on the line sensors ? That 's exactly what we 're going to do , cheater-girl . Serge . SERGE : - Yes , sir . Activate the line sensors , please . And the auto-umpire . Of course , Amanda . Come on , Miss Cheater . Honey , don 't go all immature on me just ' cause you know I 'm better than you . What 's that , cheater ? Sorry , I can 't hear you , cheater . Gods ! If only the worlds knew what a baby you are . Excuse me , Daniel . There 's an urgent message for you and Amanda from the Athenian Academy regarding Zoe . Here we go again . Let 's not prejudge this . We don 't even know what we 're dealing with yet . Holobands at school ? Cutting class ? Defiance ! - Let 's all just take a deep breath , here . Guess you better lock me up , huh ? Now what did I just say , honey ? You think that 's funny , do you ? Well , maybe you 'll think this is funny . No car privileges , no phone , no Holoband and you 're grounded for a month . Hey , hey , hey . Come on , now . Can we just ... We got a big day tomorrow . Z , your building , remember ? Oh ! Daddy , I 'm sorry , I can 't go . See , I 'm grounded . Well , we 're going to make an exception . It 's not every day you get a building named after you . Well , there 's something to be excited about . Having your name on the side of the new computer-science wing at Apollo University ' cause your daddy donated about a billion cubits to the alumni fund . You 're on thin ice already , little girl . Come on , like I even want to be associated with you and the filthy science ... Hey , that dirty science put a roof over your head , young lady . That 's enough ! You are so lucky , and you have everything in the worlds that you could possibly want , and all you do is complain about this family . You have no idea what it means to build something or to work hard for anything . It 's all just been handed to you , Zoe . I guess I 'll have to learn how to marry into money . You are gonna regret that for the rest of your life . I can 't believe I did that . Well , I think it 's okay . She knows that you didn 't mean it . I 'm sorry . No worries . I just couldn 't . When he pulled out that knife and started to ... Hey . Relax . Why do they think watching something like that is fun ? Because they 're asleep . No , that 's too easy an answer . I saw their faces . They definitely knew what they were doing . And they loved it . You sound just like me . Gee , I wonder why . So now what ? Now , we have to make sure that you don 't derez on us again . I thought I 'd solved that in the fail-safe protocol , but clearly not . Just don 't make me go back in there again and you won 't have to worry about it . It really got to you , didn 't it ? Yeah . I mean , I knew that wasn 't real . Nothing in here is real . It was the way that people were watching , the way they drew strength from what was happening . It 's all right . It 's all right . I won 't make you go back there . People are really like that ? I mean , on the outside , are they really ? Some . But that 's all gonna change . And you 're gonna help bring that change . I thought the whole idea was to travel light . Yeah , well . Do you have the passports ? Uh ... Yeah . Hey , just checking on your ETA tonight . I 'm thinking about 7 : 00 . You always say that . Oh , it shouldn 't be much later than that . The party starts at 7 : 30 . I know . I know . Hi , Dad ? You can 't be late . It 's his birthday . Do you want to put Willie in therapy for the rest of his life ? All right . Like I told your mom , sweetie , I 'm headed to court and I should be done no later than 7 : 00 . No , Daddy , no . That 's unacceptable . - That 's the best I can do . You need to promise me you 'll be there on time . Then you 'll be there . - Unacceptable ? So do I hear a promise ? - All right . All right , Your Honor . I promise . Now , put your mother back on for me . Hey , we 're getting on the lev . - What ? Can 't hear you . Talk to you at home . No , no , wait a minute . Sweetie , I want to tell you something . I ... Hello ? Frak . Hurry up , Lace . Come on , Lacy . I 'm sorry . I can 't ! Look , it 's okay . I promise , okay ? They 're gonna welcome us on Gemenon ... It 's not like it is here on Caprica . We 'll have a whole new family . I 'm sorry . I knew she 'd back out . She won 't tell anyone before we 're off-world . She won 't . Yeah . Whatever . Relax . You 're more keyed up than I am . Okay , remember that guy ? Okay , yeah . This little creep actually comes up to me and is like , " She smells like a Tauron . " You can smell them the second they walk into the room " ' cause they 're dirt eaters . " I hope you walked away . I did . After I kicked him in the balls . Tamara , you didn 't . He deserved way worse . Are you going to be like this all the way to Gemenon , or what ? Ben ? Ben ! I 'm sorry , Zo . It 's God 's will . What ? No ! Ben , wait ! The one true God shall drive out the many . What happened ? In this senseless tragedy , it 's important that you know that the government of Caprica takes matters of terrorism seriously , and that this case will be pursued until justice is served . Agent Duram . Thank you , Mr. Mayor . On behalf of the Prime Minister , let me take this opportunity to express your government 's deepest sympathy . This is what we know . A group known as Soldiers of the One is responsible for the bombing . Now , while this organization has been dormant for the past 10 years and we still have a lot of evidence to sift through , everything points to their involvement . Now , as I 'm sure you all know , the STO espouses a monotheistic religious philosophy , advocating the worship of a single , all-knowing , all-powerful God . Hey , you need a light ? Thank you . I 've never seen you smoke on TV . No , well ... Company image and all that . I quit a few years ago , actually . Started up again last week . Been trying to quit myself . Joe Adams . Daniel Graystone . Oh , sorry . Oh ! No . Gloves are symbolic . They 're to keep us away from the world during mourning , or something like that . I don 't even know why they do it . It 's an old custom . Well , at times like these , old ways are supposed to help , I guess . I ... I lost my daughter . Me , too . And my wife . I could use a cup of coffee . There 's a coffee shop around the corner . Zoe walks with Our Mother Goddess Athena now , Lacy . She will be cared for and loved and cherished for all eternity . It 's not very comforting , is it ? Truth is , it doesn 't do much for me , either . Zoe 's gone . And all the scriptures , all the prayers , all the sacrifices offered in the temples , none of these are gonna bring her back to us . Are they ? I am angry . At the Gods ? At whoever did this . It 's not right . No , it 's not . To be cut down when her life was full of so much promise . I should 've been on that train . No . I should be with Zoe . I should be dead . No . It wasn 't your time . The Gods weren 't ready to call your spirit . They have another purpose for you here . Me ? Zoe was somebody special . A genius . The things she could do with a computer ... She just seemed gifted that way . If you knew of any particular work that Zoe was doing , any work that you could find , then perhaps that would be a way for you to reconnect with her , to find comfort in discovering her in a different way . Reconnect ? Mmm . Amanda ? Yeah ? Lacy . Hi , Dr. Graystone . Are you all right ? Yeah . I know this is gonna sound kind of weird , but I was just wondering if I could sit in her room for a while . Allow entry Lacy Rand . Welcome , Lacy Rand . Thank you . Stay as long as you like . Listen , I should be going . Thanks for the coffee . Are you okay ? Sorry . Yeah . Sorry . - No , no . Hey , listen . I understand . In about five seconds , I 'm jumping off a bridge myself . I needed this , you know . Just to sit and smoke ... It 's the easiest job I 've had all day . Can I offer you a ride home ? Uh , no , I live in the city . Hey , do you follow Pyramid at all ? I 've been known to lay a few cubits on the Bucks , much to my misfortune . Yes , they have had better seasons , but I 've got courtside seats . Any interest ? Uh ... Listen , I 've got an 11-year-old boy . Is there any chance he could join us ? Absolutely . Listen , this is my private number . Why don 't you give me a call , and we 'll set up the details , okay ? Thanks . Sir . Lacy ? Is that you ? Yeah . I 'm glad you 're here . Something terrible has happened , hasn 't it ? So I 'm dead ? She 's dead . Yes . Where did all this blood come from ? I don 't see any wounds on your body . I don 't know . Maybe the bombing . The bombing ? But you weren 't even there . You couldn 't have been there . I know , but still I felt it . Zoe was working on a biofeedback protocol . She wanted me to feel what she felt in real time . She never got it working exactly , but something happened . It 's like I felt her death . Zoe is dead . What happens to me ? She had some kind of plan for you once we got to Gemenon , but I don 't even know what that was . We 're not going to Gemenon anymore , are we ? No . What am I without her ? She 's me . I 'm her . I 'm all that 's left of her . Help me , Lace . Make me understand . What am I supposed to do next ? I don 't have the answers you want , okay ? I didn 't even know for sure if you were gonna still be here once Zoe died . You 're scared of me . Why ? - I don 't know you . You grew up with me . I grew up with Zoe Graystone , and you 're not her , okay ? You 're something she created . You 're just a thing . Zoe promised me I 'd see the real world one day . And the crazy thing is , I already knew what the real world feels like . I remember it , just like I remember growing up with you . No . It 's true . I 've never been to your house , never played in your room , never puked in your bathroom or put on your make-up , or tried on your clothes . I 'm not a person . I know that . But I feel like one . It 's gonna be okay . It 's gonna be okay . Somehow . Somehow . I promise . I promise . Lacy ? Dr. Graystone . What ... What are you doing ? I ... I ... - What ? I gotta go . Lacy , why are you here ? How does the defendant plead ? Not guilty , Your Honor . The clerk will set a date for trial within the month . Bail will be set at 10,000 cubits . Your Honor , the defendant is a known member of the Ha 'la 'tha crime syndicate . There is a serious flight risk to Tauron . The State strongly recommends that bail be denied . I thank the State for its input . Ruling stands . Ten thousand cubits for the bail and 20,000 for the judge . The Guatrau is very grateful for the work you 've done for him . He has pledged to help us find the nothos that killed Shannon and Tamara . Tell the Guatrau I said thanks , but no . We 're on Caprica now . Caprica . What has this frakking planet ever done for us ? I 've got a deposition in an hour . No , no , we cannot let this pass , Joseph . We need to find them . Let me grieve in my own way . Whatever you say , my brother . But I will pray to Mars and all the Gods for a swift and terrible vengeance to come to those who have torn your wife and daughter from this world . There are no Gods , Sam . Evaluation protocol 42 . Independent identification , acquisition , resolution and execution of conflict . I had a conversation with the Minister of Defense this morning . The Prime Minister 's getting a lot of heat . The media is playing up the fact that we 're five years behind schedule and half-a-billion cubits over budget . He 's getting a lot of pressure to yank the Cyber Combat Unit contract from us and go off-world with it . They 're talking about going to Vergis . Evaluation demonstration , proceed in three , two , one . I 'll be out for the rest of the day . No calls . Let 's go . They 're waiting for us , sweetie . - Willie . How was school today ? All right . I got off of work early and thought maybe we could walk home together . All right . Okay . - Stop off for a shaved ice , huh ? You like that ? - Yeah , sure . All right . You know , I met a man who offered to take us to see the Buccaneers play . What do you think ? Sure . I thought you liked Pyramid . Sort of . Courtside seats . Could Tsattie come with us , too ? You know , I think I want to give Grandma a night off . It 's a guys ' night out . We haven 't been spending much time together lately . Ever . Do you think they still feel pain ? Sorry ? You know , Mom and Tamara , where they are . Do you still think they hurt ? What ? - I know you said no calls . Tomas Vergis is on Caprica . He 's meeting Defense Minister Chambers today . Obviously he 's making a play for the U-87 contract . I hate to say I told you so . His company is years behind us . Word is , Vergis has developed a Meta-Cognitive Processor . We 've been trying to crack that technology for a decade . Suddenly he 's got it ? I don 't think so . Vergis is going to tell Chambers that he has an MCP , that much I know . If it 's true ... I mean , if they really have a viable , independent artificial brain ... Can 't be . ... then the only thing they need is a robotic body to put it in . - I know . I know . First thing is , find out if it 's true . Saying you 've got the MCP is one thing . Actually having it is another . See what you can find out . - Okay . And , Cyrus ... Did you ever hear of these virtual nightclubs for kids , teenagers ? You know , they hack the Holobands and create these places where they can go and do things . It 's only been an underground phenomenon for about , oh , five years now . Why ? Just keep me posted on Vergis . Zoe ! Morning . - Morning . William was up all night . Again . I know . I don 't know what to do with him . Let him experience his roots . Take him home to Tauron . It 's what my daughter would have wanted . Will was born on Caprica . This is his home . Let 's not get into this , okay ? Not now . Hey , kiddo . Hey . Good morning . - Morning . How are you ? - Good . There 's an extra slice of that cherry cake you like so much . Awesome . Hey , Tsattie , are you gonna take me to school ? It 's on my way to work . I 'll take you . Okay . Dr. Graystone ? Yes . Agent Duram , Global Defense Department . I 'm wondering if you have a few minutes . What for ? Well , as you probably know , I 'm investigating the attack on the MLMT train . Should I know that ? Sorry . I 've been avoiding the news lately . That 's completely understandable . May I ? Yes . It 's about your daughter , Zoe . Yes . Was there anything in her behavior before the incident that seemed unusual to you ? She was angry , defiant , rude , vulgar , obnoxious , unreasonable , just your typical 16-year-old girl . And how would you describe her circle of friends ? Was there an anti ... Do me the courtesy of cutting to the chase , Agent Duram . We have evidence that we believe positively links your daughter to the bombers . I 'm sorry . You think that Zoe knew one of the terrorists ? Dr. Graystone , we think that Zoe might have been one of the terrorists . My daughter didn 't have a political bone in her body . Her biggest concerns in life were partying with her friends and finding new and creative ways to piss off her parents . I understand how upsetting this must be for you . We think that was sent from your daughter 's computer sheet . The message was transmitted just before the explosion , but never had a chance to uplink to the server . It took a fair amount of digital forensics to reconstruct it . It sounds like a last message to me , like someone who knows the end is near and wants to make amends . Get out . Here 's my card . If you think of anything , please don 't hesitate to call me . Welcome , Lacy Rand . May I come in ? Your security authorization is still valid . Please enter . Thanks . I 'm just going to go to Zoe 's room . As you wish . Looking for this ? You 'll pardon the way I look , but I 've been up all night trying to crack one of the better security codes I 've ever run up against . I 've been to the V-Club . I 've seen her . I saw her go into a room with an infinity symbol on the door . Now , I don 't have any idea what this means or how it 's even possible , but I have the feeling that you do . I 'm sorry , Dr. Graystone ... I want to see her , Lacy . Whatever she is , I need to know . I need to know . I 'm glad you came to see me , Joseph . We grieve for your terrible loss . Thank you for saying so , Guatrau . There 's a delicate matter I need your help on . If I can , you know I will . There is a man , an important man , who has conveniently forgotten how he got to be so important . Regrettably , he is embarking on an enterprise that will cause a great deal of distress , not only to my personal interest , but to many of my colleagues . This I cannot sanction . So action must be taken . You want me to threaten him ? I 'd like this matter to be resolved in a civilized manner , and I can think of no other Tauron as civilized as you , Tse ' Jospeh .

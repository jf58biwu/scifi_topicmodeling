 Oh , my ... - I can see the ... What ? I can see the keys . The keys . Here , I can see them . Okay ? - I can see them outside . It 's okay . - Okay . Okay . I 'm gonna come back and I 'm gonna bring the keys and we 're gonna be okay . Okay ? - Okay . - We 're gonna be okay . I 'm gonna come back . What was that ? - That was strange . What ? TV turned itself on . Come back . Okay . Mmm . - What time is it ? - Twelve-fifteen . You 're kidding . Are you serious ? Oh , God . I 'm sorry , I have to call him . My phone 's out . Thank you . Your phone 's out too . What ? I have to go . Just ... Just sit down and relax . I can 't relax , Ben . I 've never done this before . I don 't know what I 'm doing . I don 't know how . - I don 't know how to do this . - First you breathe and then realize that it 's okay . - It 's okay ? What we 're doing ? - Do you love your husband ? It doesn 't matter . All right . I 'm just gonna tell him that I went and had drinks with the girls and my phone didn 't work . Makes sense , right ? Don 't even have time to shower here . Wouldn 't want him to smell you on me . You know , you could just leave him . It 's not that simple , Ben . - I mean , I can 't possibly just ... - Anything 's possible , come on . Anything . You can drop your stuff right now and stay here tonight and never go back there again . - Ben . - Or we could go up to the rooftop and build an exotic flower garden or we could take one of my cameras and dress up like homeless people and infiltrate their community and take pictures of their lives . Or we could take my TV and throw it off the balcony and replace it with coloring books or we could leave Terminus tomorrow . New Year 's fucking Eve . We could . Leave ? We 'll go down to the station , we 'll walk up to Terminal 13 and we 'll get on a train and we 'll get in our own private compartment rip each other 's clothes off and fuck our way to freedom . We 'll go to the country and start a life . A real life . Mya and Ben . New Year 's Eve , Terminal 13 , Mya and Ben . And you don 't look back . - That 's beautiful . - It 's possible . Leave him . Leave him . I have to go . - Okay . - Okay . - What 's this ? - It 's a present . It 's a mix CD . I made it for you . Because I 'm an awesome guy . And I like you . Jesus . Fuck . Hello ? I need some help . - What ? - Please . - I don 't have any money . - I don 't need money . I 'm hurt . If you could come here a minute . Please , I need some help . Please . If you could just come here a minute . Okay ? Please , for fuck 's sake , you know ? I 'm just walking around , going to my car ... Are you okay ? - And now I 'm bleeding . Bleeding everywhere . This guy comes up and cuts me and he runs away and I think I ... Look , okay , all right , all right . You need to go to a hospital . Okay ? - Whoa ! Whoa ! - Please , help me right now . Please . - Please . No . Don 't listen to him . He 's crazy . Okay . And just because you did that for me , doesn 't mean I would . When I leave here , I 'm not coming back into your life . Did you ? Did you have any money ? Bullshit . I 'm tired of it . I 'm a woman . I cook , I clean , I wash . That 's it . It 's your deal . Now , I 'm leaving here . I 'm out of here . Do you hear me ? Fuck off . - Hey . - Hey , Janice . - Lewis is looking for you . - I know , thank you . He 's got his friends in there . You look rough . You 've got blood on your shirt . Would you guys shut the hell up already ? It 's 1 : 00 in the morning ! Thank you , Janice . I 'm going in . It 's not gonna work . Would you shut up for two seconds ? Damn it , give me a hand here . - What 's going on ? - Cable 's out . - No , outside in the hallway . This sucks . It was the best game probably there ever was . - Where 's Lewis ? - He 's in the bathroom . I mean ... Yeah ? Jerry , put the bat down and help me . First of all , the bat doesn 't get put down . But I will ... Jesus Christ . Where have you been ? I went to have a drink with the girls . I tried calling you but my phone 's dead . I tried calling you from the bar but the phone was dead there too ... Jerry , man . Give me the duct ... I decided I was ready to leave , so I just finally left . Duct tape . - But I don 't ... Reach your hand out and give me the tape . This was to be used in case of a chemical attack . Jerry , Jerry , Jerry . What 's going on ? Why isn 't anything working ? Everybody 's in the hall . Your phone work ? No . I tried calling you . I didn 't know where you were . I 'm sorry . I should have called you before I left the restaurant . - That was stupid . Give me the duct ... Who did you have drinks with ? - Donna and Emily . - Where 'd you go ? Who 's Donna ? Starbar . Donna 's new , she just started yesterday . - She 's a waitress ? - Hostess . - What did you have ? - What did I have ? What did you have to drink ? Gin and tonic and a shot of tequila . You got something on your shirt . Yeah . What is it ? It 's barbeque sauce or something , I don 't know . You reek of perfume . I don 't want to smell like a restaurant . I feel gross . You know how much I love you . You know how much I love you . You can look at me when you say that . Did you pay the cable bill , man ? I 'm having a moment with my wife . Excuse me . Why don 't you go wash up ? Get rid of that perfume . I like the way you sweat . It 's really odd , man . It 's the same sound that 's coming from the phone . Go on , take a shower , Mya . - Hey , put the fucking bat down . - What ? You almost clocked Mya in the head . Put the fucking bat down now . - It 's not hurting anybody . Just put the bat down . No . I can 't watch the game , I 'm gonna swing the bat , all right ? I told you , put it down . Sit . - What 's the matter with you ? - You could hurt somebody . - Why are you looking at me like that ? - You almost fucking killed my wife . - Sit down . - What is wrong with you ? You almost fucked my wife . What did you just say ? - You almost fucking hit her in the head . - Okay , okay , okay , boys . - Just relax , Lewis , take a seat . - I 'm not sitting down . This is my house . You guys are my guests . You 're watching my TV . You 're drinking my beer . This is my baseball bat . - That 's my wife you almost hit . - Lewis , I think maybe we ... Take a shower , baby . Okay . I understand that . You 're a little aggressive right now , man . Why is he staring at me like that ? - I 'm not even looking at you . - You 're doing it right now . - Look , look at him . He 's doing it now . Okay , fellas . Look , just take a deep breath and sit down , please . Lewis , God ... Lewis ! Lewis . What have you done ? What 's wrong with you ? Let go . Get off . Let ... Get off . Get in the shower , babe . Lewis , what 's the matter with you ? Lewis , what have you done ? Janice . Janice . Janice . Janice ! Janice ! Janice ! Janice ! - Janice . Janice , the door . Come inside . - Come inside . Close the door . - Look , you gotta close the door . No , no , you 're safe . - Janice , there 's a man ... - Stay in here . Stay in here . Just stay in here . Stay in here . Honey ... Shh , shh , shh . You 're gonna be okay . You 're with me . You 're okay . Steven , come out here now . Steven , come over here . Did you hear me ? Come here , come here . Come here . Mya ? Did you get crazy in your head ? How am I supposed to know ? Tell me . Look me in the eyes . Are you looking ? I 'm gonna pull this duct tape off . You make any noises I 'm gonna whack you , do you understand ? Hm ? Huh ? Did you kill anybody last night ? How am I supposed to know ? Tell me , I 'm ... Wait , where did you go ? Where were you ? I hid in the apartment across the hall . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . I couldn 't trust anybody , I went looking for you , I couldn 't find shit . Everybody 's either dead , dying or completely flipped . Mad , crazy . - Why did Lewis hurt Jerry ? - Hurt ? Jerry 's dead , lady . Lewis got him . Fucking snapped . I couldn 't get any sense into him . I knocked him out . I taped him up so he couldn 't hurt anybody else . I had no choice . Then I saw the hallway . I 've never seen anything like that . One out of two people just started killing each other . They decided to kill people . I 've never killed anybody before . What do I do ? I 'm not gonna fuck around . But , you know , what do I do ? So anybody who comes at me I take them out . No questions asked . Got to . Anybody . Anybody else , I secure and I put in a safe place . No telling who 's gonna go crazy next . You got to put them up . I pulled the fire alarm . I don 't know why . Maybe somebody 'll come . Maybe they won 't . Maybe they 're screwed up too . So I went to the roof . Gotta see the big picture . One 's gotta know , have to know , right ? Then I see it , in the streets . All of Terminus , it 's happening everywhere . People are going crazy in their head . First it 's just murder , the crazy kill anybody , everybody , each other . Indiscriminate , it looks like chaos . Then I realized , they 're thinking . Then I really get scared because it 's rational . They know what they 're doing . I mean , they think it makes sense . But it doesn 't make any sense . It 's different for everybody . Let me tell you , they are gonna fucking murder the world . And I 'm thinking they all gotta die . You know , but I can 't kill them all . I 'm thinking that there 's too many . Maybe I 'll run . But run where ? I 'm thinking then I get hit in the head . Is it so bad ? You 'll be fine . Fucker has a hammer . I have a hammer go into my head . So I smash his face . And I realize he 's not crazy . He thinks I 'm crazy . I 'm not crazy . He 's hurt really bad , so I finish him . I taped up 12 people last night . All of them had been killed by morning . All but Lewis . What do I do ? Yeah , we go . We go . We walk out that door and we start walking , and we don 't stop . We don 't stop . We don 't talk to anybody . We don 't draw attention to ourselves . We just keep walking . We go to my car ... We go to my car , and we get in and we drive . Okay ? We do this right now . We drive ? - Yeah . - Where we gonna go ? Is it safe ? Come on , Rod , keep walking . Walk , Rod . Hey . Roger ? - Is that you ? - Keep walking , Rod . - Wait . Wait , wait , wait . Rod . - Maybe she 's just confused . - Rod ! Do you ... ? Rod ! - Do you have the crazy ? Fuck . You fucking bitch . You fucking bitch , you fucking bitch ! Rod . Shit . Wait . Wait . Wait . Wait ! Wait ! What are you ... ? Wait . I got a gun . I got shot . I got shot , and you were gonna leave me back there . - Put your seat belt on . - You were gonna leave me . Fuck . Yeah , fuck right , you were gonna leave me . Can 't trust anyone . Fuck , the radio too . - Turn it off . Rod , turn the fucking radio off . - Do you hear that ? Do you think I wanted to kill those people ? I had to . I 'm sorry . Goddamn it . Now I 'm gonna fucking bleed to death . - You 're gonna be okay . - Fuck , fuck , fuck . I don 't wanna die like this . You 're gonna be okay , Rod . You 're lying . You 're lying to me . We should not be out here . We should have stayed . I trusted you . Please keep quiet . Look at me , you fucking crazy bitch . I 'm bleeding to death . - Please be quiet . Shut up ! - You shot me in the stomach . You left me to bleed in the street . - Shut up , shut up , shut up . - I 'm not saying anything . What are you doing ? Don 't leave me . You 're crazy , Rod . Just like all those other people . Don 't . I don 't have the crazy . - Are you okay ? - Don 't come near me . I 'm just trying to help . Hey , it 's not safe out here . I 've got a place here . You should come inside . Where are you going ? I 'm going to Terminal 13 to meet somebody and we 're gonna leave this fucking town and never look back . Do you understand ? Don 't fucking follow me . Well , what about the guy in the car ? I know what you 're thinking . You don 't have to say it . No need to tell me , because I already know . You think this party is a bad idea . I just don 't think we can have people over right now . I 'll just tell them that the party 's been canceled . Clark ? You look chapped . This is a dress-up party here tonight . I need a couple of things that Ken borrowed , namely my hatchet . And some garbage bags . Ken , I 'm gonna need that hatchet you borrowed . I also need to borrow a couple of ... - He 's dead . - Yeah . - I 'm going to turn our program on . - Sounds glorious . - How many more balloons do we need ? - At least seven . - That 's how many I was thinking . - Well , that 's why you married me . Honey ? What is it ? Honey , people are coming over . Honey . Honey . You 're hurting me . Stop , honey , you 're hurting me . Honey , stop . Oh , my God . I know . He 's kind of gross now . Anna , I 'm sorry . Are you mad at me for killing your friend ? - What ? - I know he 's your friend and all . - We weren 't that close . - You always helped him fix stuff . - I 'm your landlord . - I know , but are you mad at me ? No . You did what you had to do . We all do what we have to do sometimes . Oh , shit . What are you doing ? So I guess we 're in this together . What should we do now ? I 'm still trying to figure out that one . What if my party guests show up ? Anna , I don 't know if you know this but there is some seriously insane shit going on out there right now . People are losing their minds . There 's a bad sector in the electromagnetic spectrum which is causing a rift in logical thinking . Rational behavior has given way to primordial action . We 've reached a critical juncture in the consistency of everyday living . Societal norms are being completely abandoned . Anarchy has replaced etiquette . Chaos is the ruling class of this civilization . I think coming to a goddamn New Year 's Eve party is the last thing on people 's minds . All right . You get rid of them , I 'm gonna move Ken into the bedroom . Well , what should I say ? Anything . Just don 't let them in , no matter what . Okay . - Yes ? Pest control . There 's no party , thanks . Somebody here call an exterminator ? - We don 't have bugs . I think they were rats , ma 'am . Your husband must have called it in . - Ken ? - Yeah . - Ken . - Hey , we 're fine . Thank God it 's you . You 're alive . Wait , do you have it ? Are you crazy ? Look , I know you left me in the chair because you thought I 'd lost it . But I didn 't . I saw your car outside , and I thought the worst had happened . I thought that one of ... One of those people had gotten to you and taken you away from me . They can 't get to you . No one can get to you . What 's this now ? Stop , what are you doing ? Don 't do that to him . He was coming at you , I thought he might be one of them . He 's my friend , he 's helping me . You can 't do that to friends . - Looked like he was going to hurt you . He 's Clark , you idiot . - He 's not gonna hurt me . - You can 't trust anybody . Oh , his poor eyes are burning . Mya , I 'm sorry . Who 's Mya ? I 'll check in the bathroom to see if there 's anything to flush the poison with . Don 't go in there . Don 't go in there . What do you have here ? It 's , you know , Ken . He 's napping . He looks dead . - He is . - I see . - Who did this ? - I did . - But I didn 't want to . - You killed him ? - And Clark killed somebody too . - I didn 't ... I did . - It was self-defense . - You chopped his head off . He had it coming . Probably . These are wild times . Everybody 's being driven to desperate measures . I guess this happens to everybody . I 've got something to show you too . You just don 't know who to trust right now . Mya . Where 's Mya ? Untie me . Ah ! Fuck . You 're him . Rod ! The TV must have gotten into his head and told him to kill you . Yeah , that 's what happened to Ken . He was watching TV and it made him go bad . This is , without a doubt , the most fucked-up day in the history of mankind . We should get back inside . Who wants cocktails ? Party guests . Act natural . - Hi . - You gotta help me . My mom was trying to kill me and so I ran over her and my dad made the dog die because it tried to bite me and I left it in the car , and I didn 't know where to go and I remembered that Anna and Ken lived here , and I 'm Laura . - Laura . - Anna . Laura ! What the fuck ? You killed Laura . She was coming at you . Stay away from me . You killed Laura . She was heading for you with that knife . - She doesn 't have a knife . - That 's a key chain . I was trying to protect you . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's all right . - He beat her face in . - I know . I know , and I 'm gonna find out what happened but I need you to be strong for me . Okay ? Laura might have actually wanted to hurt you . Her puppy 's name was Charlie Man . We don 't know where Laura was at in her head . We don 't , okay ? Look , for all we know , she might have received this cancerous signal . This hypnotic frequency that 's all around . She might have transmitted it , from her car radio . Or the television or stereo or ... We don 't know . I mean , everybody 's a suspect right now , everyone . Turn that off . - Why did you turn that on ? - I didn 't . She did . Ah ! The TV went on , she came back to life . She 's trying to get me . Get back at me for what I did to her . This is getting to be ridiculous . God in heaven . Just open the door , then I 'll take them down . That 's not the way to play this . Can 't be sure . We have to exterminate with extreme prejudice . It might be somebody who could help us . We don 't know . We can 't risk it . I 'm killing whoever walks through that door . It 's Jim . It 's Jim Parsons . - Trust no one . - You were watching TV . I told you I wasn 't watching the TV . Listen , if I had it , I would 've killed you by now , right ? I guess . I 'm fine , and you 're fine and she 's fine . This we know . But he may not be , and probably isn 't . You might be right . He might be infected . Then we 'd have to kill Jim . Jim Parsons . Maybe if we 're quiet , he 'll go away . - He wants in , to get us . - Shush ! Shh ! He 's gone . Sweet ... Clark . Clark , is that you ? I have to let the poor guy in , he might be in trouble . Please , let me handle this . If he 's not okay , I 'll kill him myself . Don 't leave me out here , man . - Clark , come on , let me in . - Jim ? Yeah , it 's me , Clark . Hey , Clark . Let me in . Okay , just give me a second . Come on , buddy . I ain 't got any ... Anywhere else to go tonight . Clark . You just gotta turn the handle . Okay . Where is everybody ? Oh , I 'm early . - Early ? - The shindig . The fiesta . That 's tonight , right ? It better be . That ball drops , I 'm gonna grab a slut , and I 'm just gonna pee in her butt . - Jim , are you aware that ... ? - Oh , no , I 'm so sorry . - Jim . Jim Parsons . - Jim Parsons . This is , um ... - Lewis . - Lewis . Lewis . Clark . Lewis and Clark . Where 's Sacagawea ? I would totally fuck an Indian girl . I would . Those kind , if I ever saw one . I would just take her back to the tepee , " Oh , nice little squaw . Oh , peel my corn , " you know ? Seriously , is there gonna be some pussy here ? Because I really don 't wanna make out with my two brave explorers here . So you 're here for the party ? You know this , yeah . Are Ken and Anna around ? Anna 's getting ready . And Ken is just laying down for a second . He 's dead tired . Can I get you a cocktail , Jim ? Oh , yeah , please . Put that in the fridge , I 'll get that later . Hm . It says " Lewis " on your shirt . That 's funny . I didn 't even see it . Place looks good . Ken . I knew you 'd get better . She 's got nice boobs in there . I hope she has some cute friends . That 'd be nice . I went to a party last year everybody started kissing each other , you know , at midnight like , the tradition , or how did that start ? Everybody starts kissing each other and I had no one else to kiss , so I , just as a joke , kissed the dog but then I realized when I got home I made out with the dog for New Year 's . It 's wrong . Tonight I really wouldn 't mind just cleaning out my pipes , you know ? Maybe a m茅nage 脿three in there . Clark 's been in there a long time . You know she 's with everybody , I guess . You . Me . Clark . The milkman . She 's damaged goods . Somebody should just put her out of her misery . That 's my wife . What ? That 's not your wife , that 's Ken 's wife . Your wife 's not here . Your wife has gone far away out of your sight where you can 't help her anymore . You don 't know what you 're saying . No . You don 't know what you 're saying . That TV got in your brain and has distorted your perception . I 'm not crazy like those others . No , man . You 're much worse off because you don 't even realize what 's happening to you . You don 't even know . Your wife left you , alone , tied to a chair , helpless so the world could take your life and the savages could feast on your remains . No . She 's here . She 's fine . Sorry . But that 's just not true . I love you , Ken . But I know where she is and I 'm going to find her and free her of the burden of being the used-up , adulterous whore that she is . I 'm going to get to her . I 'm gonna get to her before you and there 's nothing you can do about that . My wife 's in there and she 's upset because I accidentally killed her friend . But she 's safe now and you can 't get to her . I won 't let you get to her . What ? That was kind of odd . What are you saying ? Where is she ? Who ? My wife . How the hell do I know ? I just met you . I didn 't know you were married , that 's kind of ... Kind of cool . I wish I was married . What did you do that for ? Where 's my wife ? Where 's Mya ? She 's fine . She didn 't leave me . She loves me and only me . And everything is going to be safe and quiet . Don 't touch her . She was just upset , and I was consoling her . Please leave us alone , we don 't want you here . I 'm trying to have an intimate moment with my husband before the end of the world . But I 'm your husband . You 're not my husband . You 're a homicidal maniac . But I killed him for you . I didn 't want that , and I didn 't ask for it . And the last person I wanna die with is you . Ken . I think he 's gonna kill us . I 'm not Ken . Okay ? Look , that 's Ken . Shit , okay . - No , I ... I 'm Ken . I can be Ken . - You 're not Ken . She 's not Mya . I 'll be whoever you guys want me to be . If she 's not Mya , that means you did something to Mya . No , no . She can be Mya . Right ? Right . Mya , Mya ... Look at me . Look at me . So I was admittedly a little fucked up earlier . It 's been a crazy day for me as I 'm sure it has been for you as well . But I get it now . You 're not Mya . You never were Mya . You 're just some other woman that doesn 't matter . So , what I need you to tell me so we don 't stretch this out any longer than either of us wants where is Mya ? Where is my wife ? Answer me or you get the spray again . Where is Mya ? I can 't see . She has to be here somewhere . Her car is outside . I know she 's been here . I can smell her perfume all over this place . We were having a party . I need to know where she is . I have to find her . I love her . I have to save her . I gotta see so I can have a party . Look , I know my wife came in here so tell me where you 're hiding her or where she went so I can kill you and get it over with and then I 'll know where she is . Where Ken ? I want to see Ken . Ken 's enjoying the party . Ken . I want to see you . Ken ? Ken ? What are you doing to her ? It 's time to go home now . Ken , I am home , silly . Oh , my God . You . You know . You know where she went . You 're wrong . You 're wrong , man . You 're seeing things wrong . The stuff that 's in your head is not real . You 'll see things the way I 'm seeing them . You just gotta understand . Understand the message coming through . No , it 's making people think the wrong things . Everything is not what it seems . I was misunderstanding it before but I get it now . It 's telling me what I should do . What I should want . I want my wife and I want my home . And I want all of you people to stop bothering us . So tell me where she is . You can 't just kill ... What 's in your head to tell you ... It 's not what ... It 's a poisonous ... It 's radioactive ... You had to kill those people , didn 't you ? That 's right . They were keeping you from happiness . Now you understand . - I wanna be happy . - You will . You will if you let go and tell me . Tell me where she went . Terminal 13 . She said she was going to Terminal 13 to get out . - Get out of Terminus . - See ? See how easy that was ? You 're him . Rod ! Fuck . Come on . Stand up . Come on . Don 't do that . Come on , get up . See how easy that was ? Stop . Please stop . Please stop , Lewis . I 'm not Lewis . Look , I ... I really need your help , okay ? The girl in the car wreck outside , did you see her ? Did you see where she went ? Look , everything 's gonna be fine . Okay ? But I need you to listen to me . Okay ? Just listen . If you listen to me , I can help you make it go away . Okay ? Who are you ? What 's your name ? Just tell me your name . - Clark . I 'm Clark . - Hi , Clark . - Um , I 'm Ben . - Ben . We need to get out of here right now . All right ? - Just hold on . It 's all right . - No . No . No . - All right . This might hurt just a little . - No . No . No . Wait , wait , wait . Clark . Clark . Goddamn it , Clark . I need your help . Clark . Clark . Clark . Clark , open the door . Right now . Clark ? Lewis Denton . Open the door ! - Listen to me . Open the fucking door . The car , the one that 's wrecked outside . The girl inside of it , where did she go ? - I told you already . - Not me . That wasn 't me . We 've got to find her . I don 't know . I don 't know . Maybe he knows . He was with her . Man , he 's not gonna be able to talk to us . I killed him . Didn 't I ? Think back , okay ? Did he say anything before he died ? No . God . - Fuck . - Look , he 's going to help us , all right ? - We just gotta get the brain fired . - What ? If we stimulate the premotor cortex we can definitely restore some limited speech patterns . Right ? Okay . Sure . Do it . - Oh , God . Oh , God . - Just relax . Relax . Hold on . I got this , okay . You just finish jump-starting the head . Okay ? Okay . Clark . All right , then . Fuck you want ? Can you hear me ? - Got a smoke ? - I don 't smoke . Ask him about the girl . You want to know about the girl , give me a c ... - Cigarette . - He wants a cigarette . What ? You can 't be ... You gotta be fucking kidding me . What 's he saying ? Where 'd she go ? She told you she went to Terminal 13 . Bitch . Terminal 13 . She said she was going to Terminal 13 . Terminal 13 . No . - She was going to find you . - Nobody leaves Terminus . Hey , he also says that no one can leave Terminus . Because it 's an impossibility , so I guess we 'll have to stay here . - That right ? - Yeah . Good work . Now , um ... You 're aware you 're having a conversation with a decapitated head . Right ? Listen to me . Listen . Listen to me . You hear that ? Listen , it 's ... Past the noise in your head that is the natural world . That 's been here a long time before us . It 's gonna be here a long time after we 're gone . That is real . And that is what we focus on . - Past the noise . - Yeah . This calls for a radical reassessment of all the facts . Clark ? Lewis Denton again . Look , man , I think I found your sledgehammer out here . So I 'm gonna borrow it for a second if that 's okay . I 'm gonna knock this door off its fucking hinges . I thought we had an understanding . Apparently I was wrong . Fuck . Clark , don 't . You fucking A-hole ! Breathe . Breathe , man . Just breathe . We wanna save our breathing . Do you have a car ? - All right , it 's all right . - Ow ! Fuck . Okay . You got it ? Are you sure you 're okay to drive ? - It 's the generator . - What ? It 's supposed to be self-sustaining . Adaptable . The only way to get the system out is to add indeterminism ... - Watch the road . ... to the dynamic . Give the system the possibility to make transitions to smarter states . You 're making complete sentences . Good . But the filter must have failed . So now it 's broadcasting that frequency . What the hell are you talking about ? It disrupts synaptic neural networks , causing extreme behavioral shifts . - Great panic . - I got it , I got it . Paranoia . Rage . Enhanced suggestibility . There go your calcium ions . Snap , crackle , pop . What are you talking about ? - Out of your brain cells . - Drive the car . - What are you trying to tell me ? - Psychotron resonance . A broadcast on that scale could cause mass psychosis . Clark , I don 't know who or what started it but we all sure as shit signed up for it . We made ourselves vulnerable . When Mya left last night I turned the TV back on , and there it was . It was replacing my thoughts . The sun came up . I see it . It 's a lie . The signal . It 's a trick .

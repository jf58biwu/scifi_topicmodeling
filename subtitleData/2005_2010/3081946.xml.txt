 Where does it come from ? This quest , this need to solve life 's mysteries when the simplest of questions can never be answered . Why are we are ? What is the soul ? Why do we dream ? Perhaps we 'd be better off not looking at all . Not dwelving , not yearning . That 's not human nature . Not the human heart . That is not why we are here . How is he doing ? I 'm sorry , did I scare you ? No . No , I just ... I keep having these amazing dreams everytime I close my eyes and ... Nevermind . He likes me reading the stock page . Is he even conscious at all ? No . It 's been a week now . I think he 's close . A couple more days maybe . You know I don 't know what he 'd do without you . You have a real gift . Just doing my job . No . You 're like a son to him . Yeah , well , that would make us like brother and sister , it 'd be a little ankward if I ever wanted to ask out . I 'm sorry . That was ... That was inappropriate . No , it 's sweet , it 's ... - I 'm dating somebody and I ... - Yeah . No , really , it 's okay . I need to change his IV . I 'm sorry . Man is a narcissistic species by nature . We have colonized the 4 corners of our tiny planet . But we are not the pinacle of so-called evolution . That honor belongs to the lowly cockroach . Capable of living for months without food . Remaining alive headless for weeks at a time . Resistant to radiation . If god has indeed created himself in his own image , then I submit to you that god is a cockroach . They say that man uses only a 10th of his brain power . Another percent and we might actually be worthy of God 's image . Unless of course that day has already arrived , the human genome project has discovered that tiny variations in man 's genetic code are taking place at increasingly rapid rates . Teleportation , levitation , tissue regeneration , is this outside the realm of possibility ? Or is man entering a new gateway to evolution ? Is he finally standing at the threshold of true human potential ? I 'm sorry . I 'm out of time . I know , I know , I 'm beginning to sound like my father . I can 't help it . You know they can fire me too if they like . But there is something to it , Merad . As crazy as it sounds ... - What is it ? - It 's your father . He 's dead . How ? Driving a taxi in New York City is a very dangerous job . The wrong fare , the wrong time , we may never know what really happened . You know I spoke to him 2 days ago . He was convincing someone was following him , trying to steal his research . He died because of his thesis . - That 's crazy ! - Is it ? The man left his family , discredited his career to chase wild theories halfway around the world . Where are you going ? To his apartment , to get his papers and research . He was this close to finding the first of them . His patient zero . He tracked him to Queens , New York . Mohinder , listen to me . Your father was my colleague and my friend . A respected professor , a brilliant geneticist but he had clearly lost touch with reality . I followed in his footsteps . My thesis is based on his research . Yes , you always wanted his approval . And now you 're telling that it was all for nothing ? I 'm telling you ... to let go . I need to know why he died . I need to know that it wasn 't all for nothing . And then I need to finish what he started . Hello ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm in his place now . No , no , no , he left everything behind but his computer . Research , the map . Yeah , let 's get a team in here to bag and tag everything . I gotta call you right back . Pervert ! Time to get up , Mika ! Mika . Mika ! Mika ! - Mika ! - What ? Damn , Mika , don 't do that to me . Do what ? You need to be careful . Right ? I 'm just working on my computer . Prologic prog 's bad . So I had to build a new one . A new one . Anyone ever tell you you 're the smartest little man on the planet ? You do , all the time . What 's this ? It 's a pinhall camera . It 's for the eclipse . The moon 's gonna cover up the sun today . We 're supposed to look at it at school . Speaking of which , you need to go get ready . You can 't be late . Not today . Mom , I 'm already dressed and I 've packed my own lunch . That 's what I 've been doing this morning . What about you ? Don 't get smart with me . I 've been working to pay our bills . Yeah , that 's why they turned down our gas again ? Go grab your stuff and wait by the backdoor , okay ? - Why ? - Just do it . Mom , what 's going on ? Nevermind , just keep your voice down and stay close to me . - Camera ready ? - Yeah , almost . Hold on . It 's like 70 , 80 feet . This is so unreal . Okay , I 'm good . Okay . Oh my ... Oh my God ! Oh my God ! Claire ! Oh my God ! Claire ! This is Claire Bennett . That was attempt number 6 . You get out here , yes ? Mr. Linderman , I 'm gonna have to call you back in 5 minutes , okay ? Thank you . I 'm late . I 've got a fundraiser and a drinks meeting It happened two more times . Sometimes I 'm falling , sometimes I 'm flying . - Sometimes you 're in ' em . - I don 't have time for this now . They aren 't just dreams , Nathan . Hold this . I thought they 'd go away but they 're not . I 'm gonna need this back by 6 , please . Thanks . This morning when I got out of bed , my foot hovered before it touched the ground . Hovered for a split second like I was floating . I 'm telling you , I think I can fly . Is Owen decided ? I 'll tell you what , you think you can fly , why don 't you just off the Brooklyn Bridge ? See what happens . Maybe I oughta start with something a little lower first . It 's le leng twalk . - You 're serious ? - Oh , I 'm serious . You need to snap out of it , Peter . Go see a doctor . Get some drugs . Do not pull a Roger Clinton on me , man . I 'm 8 points down in the polls . This is not about you , all right ? Something is happening to me . And I have this feeling that you 're the only person that 's gonna understand . Why the hell would I understand that you think you can fly ? Because you 're my brother . Mom , look , I can 't talk right now , I 've got ... What ? I 'll be there in ten minutes . - What did she do now ? - She got arrested . - Arrested for what ? - Shoplifting . I 'm so depressed . What ? What are you talking about ? Why ? - Camera ready ? - Yeah . Besides the fact that it was so gross , I almost fudge myself , this is the single coolest thing that happened in this town in like a 100 years . Not if nobody finds out , it 's not . Why did you want me to tape you ? I have my reasons . It 's not like you 're not gonna be popular anymore Popular ? who said anything about being popular ? my life as I know it is over , okay ? I 've got the Bishop game next week , SATs in October , homecoming is 3 weeks from today and I 'm a freak show ! You 're being a little dramatic , don 't you think ? No , I don 't think . I have busted like every bone in my body , stabbed myself in the chest , I 've shoved a two foot steel rod through my neck and I don 't have a scratch on me . What do you call that thing , sticking out ? Great ! Just give me the tape , okay ? I can give you a ride on my handlebars . If you want . Look ... thanks , okay ? I 'll talk to you in front of people at school tomorrow . Promise . Your son is a very intelligent boy . Gifted , actually . That 's not the issue . His father is not around and sometimes I think he could use a bit of a tronger hand , you know . I work nights a lot but uh ... we can both work harder . It 's not about the work . The truth is I just don 't know if this school is the right fit for him . - But he 's made friends . - I 'm sorry . - He 's on the soccer team . - I 'm sorry . I wrote a check for $ 25,000 to get him into this snob fest . I was told that 's what it took . That 's on top of the tuition . About the tuition , your last 3 checks have bounced . Fine , take it out of the 25 grand that I gave you . That was a donation and it was very appreciated . Well , I want my money back . I want my money back now . That money went to capital campaign for the new wing . - It 's already been spent . - Then unspend it . I 'm sorry . We can maybe discuss an extension of the money you owe but I ... I want my money back . That 's not possible . Come on , baby . Let 's get out of here . You 're too good for this lousy school . Mom ? Leave me alone ! For god 's sakes , ma . Are you okay ? They dropped the charges . I had to fill out a form . No big deal . No big deal ? I 'm running for Congress . Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to me if it gets out ? With our family 's past . What could you possibly need so bad that you had to steal it ? Nevermind , I don 't wanna know . - Socks ? - Socks . Dad left you a fortune . What are you thinking ? You know , it 's been one ridiculous stunt after another with you for the last 6 months . Dad 's gone . Just get over it . You know what ? Leave her alone . She 's okay . That 's all that matters . I gotta keep this out of the press . You know what ? Just get out of here . Go worry about you , I 'll handle this . Yeah , good , I gotta make sure this stays buried . Thanks a lot , ma ' ! What were you thinking ? I just wanted to feel alive again . Nathan only cares about himself . Your father was the same way . Alpha dogs , both of them . You , in the meantime , for all your selflessness and sitting with dying people ... What ? You 're gonna retire with what you make ? Maybe I 'll shoplift my socks . Don 't get smart . When you put everyone else first , you end up last . You always put Nathan first , he took advantage . It wasn 't you that was just pushing him right out in front of me ? He takes up more space than you . Demanded more attention . And besides it 's not my fault , you allowed it . He 's my brother , I love him . Love is overrrated . He loves me too . You know it . You 've always been close . Croseolorlasses . That 's cruel , mom . Since dad died I know you 've been feeling free to speak your mind but it wouldn 't hurt to edit yourself every once in a while . I 'm sorry if the truth hurts . I 'm just saying you hero worships him . And those feelings will never return . You 're wrong . It 's biological . I can 't help it . We 're .. We 're connected . I never told you this but when Nathan had his accident , I knew it . We all got the same call . No , I 'm saying before the call . Like he was telling me . 300 miles away . I woke up and I knew that he 'd been hurt . I hate it here . She doesn 't even have any books to read . Baby , I 'll be right back . I 'm just gonna go and pack up a few things , okay ? We should really go see dad . - What good would that do ? - He could help . He should know that someone is trying to hurt us . Your dad is in no position to help us right now . Look , I made some mistakes . - I admit it . - Mom , what did you do ? Hey . I need you to know that I would never let anything happen to you . I promise . Mom , why did you look at yourself like that in the fish tank ? - How long ? - A couple hours tops . There 's some ice cream in the fridge . Go ahead . - What happened ? - I went to see Linderman . How much ? 30 . You 're gambling again ? No , it 's just bills . I used the rest to get Mika into private school . I don 't know what to do with him in public and ... it 's just I needed them to think that we had money on the mob ? Hell , Nicky . - You weren 't born yesterday . - It 's just 2 weeks overdue . I thought that I could handle it , okay ? - I 'm under a lot of stress , okay ? - Gee , I wonder why ! I feel like I 'm kinda losing it a little bit . I 'm seeing things . Like ? Like I keep feeling like someone is watching me . Yeah , Linderman wants his money back so he sent some mouthbreather that 's gonna put you in the hospital . No , it is someone else . It 's someone that I can 't see . Does this make any sense to you ? No . - I 'm sorry . You know what ... - But I 'll tell you what does . I shouldn 't be telling you this . No , let me tell you what does make sense . You need to come up with that 30 grand plus interests now . Or you gotta run . Watch him . All right . Cool , huh ? How hot do you think it is in there ? Turn on the camera . Scotty ! Scotty ! Come on ! - Take it easy . - I 'm okay . - You 're all right . - I 'm fine . There 's no burns . I was real sorry to hear about your father . Seemed like a good guy . Man ! I thought I was a slob ! They were here too . - What ? - Nothing . I got a guy who can clean this up for a 100 bucks . No , it 's all right . I 'll take it as it is . We rent by the week . I 'm gonna need to know you can afford it . - I have a job . - Doing what ? Driving a taxi . I 'll get you an application . Oh , god , what ? The si tntreatment ? Oh , boy . Isaac ... what are you doing ? What the hell is wrong with you Isaac Okay , stop What are you , crazy ? clearly . I don 't even remember painting these . I Was high , okay ? - I lied to you . - Damn it . I 've been chasing for a month . Well , then get yourself back into a program and make it stick this time . What are you talking out ? Want to know what I 'm talking about ? You see this ? Suice bombingin israel . - I painted it three weeks ago - Yeah . and so ? so ... that 's this morning 's paper . Look at the number on thhe bus This happened yesterday . Yesterday . Something 's wrong with me . Well i 'll get you help , isaac .

It only took half of my political capital to pull her off . Why can 't she get herself a hobby ? Like a normal person ? They were married 41 years . It 's a plea for attention . She 's lonely . Give her some time , will you ? I don 't have time . I 've got 8 days to make up 10 points . I need all the help I can get which is what I want to talk to you about . I wanna offer you a job . - A job ? - Yeah . I trust you . You 're good with people . I need a coordinator to help organize the volunteers and you got nice guy instincts , I could use that . I 'm a shark , Pete . Everybody knows it . It 's starting to show up in the polls . I bring you on , it kinda reflects well on me . You know what I mean ? All right , so I 'm making you look good ? That 's a new one . Makes me look like I put family first . I mean I know that sounds self-serving but this is for you too , right ? You gotta think of your future . How do you do that ? Do what ? Even try to make it look like this has something to do with me . You didn 't hear anything that I said earlier today , did you ? You mean about how you can fly ? Yeah , I did . I 'm gonna pretend fo both our sakes you didn 't say anything like that . I 'm trying to do the right thing here . I already have a job . Yeah , watching old people die , now there 's a career . It 's not cute anymore , man . The dreamy kid sitting in the back of the classroom , staring at the window . It 's time for you to grow up . Look , I cast a big shadow , Pete . I get it .

Makes one appreciate just how small our planet really is . And we 're all quite small really , aren 't we ? What 's your name ? Mohinder . I 'm Peter . May I ask you something , Mohinder ? Do you ever get the feeling like you were meant to do something extraordinary ? I 'm driving a cab , you may have noticed . I 'm not talking about what you do , I 'm talking about ... who you are . I 'm talking about ... being special . Yes , we are all special . It 's not what I meant . Some individuals , it is true , are more special . This is natural selection . It begins as a single individual . Born or hatched like every other member of their species . Anonymous , seemingly ordinary . Except they 're not . They carry inside them the genetic code that will take their species to the next evolutionary round . It 's destiny . Hey , I can 't believe you left like that . I know , I was there . You saved that dude 's life . Welcome home . Get over there . 50 grand is a lot of money . 50 ? It was 30 . Even with interest ... Mr. Linderman wants to be nice about this . You should have read the fine print . Look , I have a son . I 'm all he 's got . Please , I can get you the money . I 'll tell you what I 'm gonna do . I 'm gonna make you a little business proposition . You make what ? 40 bucks for every 20 minutes you take off your clothes ? I 'm gonna give you a chance to lower your debt a little . And see where it goes from there . Come on . Come on . Show me what you got . Lift up your shirt , baby . Ooh , look at that belly . Smile for me . Is that what you want ? Ah , yes .

There was a professor Suresh in the university of Madras . Geneticist . Interesting theories . Don 't think he 's teaching anymore . But you wouldn 't know anything about that , would you ? Probably a lot of Sureshs where you 're from . Like Smith ... or Anderson . And then Carla had the nerve to tell me he 's not breed worthy . Like he didn 't win 5 all breed rallies , two regionals . Can you believe it ? It 's just not true , Mr. Mubbles . It 's not true , He 's a little stud muffin . That 's what he is . He still humps my leg when I watch TV . All right , enough about , Mr. Mubbles . What did everybody else do today ? Doug and I saw this mexican guy . A homeless dude , on the way to school . We thought he was dead . But he wasn 't . I thought dad was coming home today . Well , I was gonna surprise you ... He finished up early , he 's coming home tonight . Ain 't that great ? Just in time to read my report card . So what about you Claire ? Do anything special today ? I walked through fire and I didn 't get burned . What the hell is that supposed to mean ? God ! You 're so crazy sometimes . Lyle ! I think I know exactly what you mean . Here I am talking dogs again and you go and say something really profound ! We come up against all kinds of fires in our lives and when we test ourselves and face our fears , we usually don 't get burned . You are very wise , sweetheart . Whatever it is you did , I 'm proud of you . And so is Mr. Mubbles . He 's just so proud of Claire . Aren 't we ? We 're proud of Claire . Yes , we 're so proud of Claire , aren 't we ? What are you looking for ? - Morphine . - What for ? I need you to come with me some place . Where ? You 'll see . Look , there 's something I need to tell you . That is gonna have to wait . No , look , I need to tell you about this , okay ? I need to stop living for other people . My whole life , I 've ... I 've no idea what I 'm supposed to do , what I 'm supposed to be if I 'm gonna have a destiny of my own ... I promise you we will talk about this later , okay ? All right , now I really need you to come with me . You 're a nurse . You can give out a shot . - You can help him . - Help who ? I thought we could go to the movies . It 's Saturday . Maybe ... try on some shoes at the new mall in Garden Dale . Sure . I love you , mom . But ? No buts , I just ... wanted to tell you that . No , you think I 'm trying to be your best friend again , admit it . No , it 's ... It 's all right , we can go to the movies together . It 's no big deal . I just miss you . That 's all . I wanna be your mom . I wanna ... give you advice but I don 't wanna push you away . I want advice , I do . I ... I won 't push you away I promise . I just don 't think you should be so worried about ... fitting in all the time . About being so popular . I don 't wanna see you make mistakes like I did . I wanted to be someone more interesting than I am . You are interesting . You breed show dogs . Whose mom does that ? No , I wanted to hitchhike across Europe , study art , fall in love with some ... poetry quoting french man . Not that your dad isn 't wonderful but my point is ... You should know who you are and know that it 's enough . 'Cause who you are is special . About that . There 's something I need to say . Something I never talked about ' cause I thought it would upset you and dad . Sweetheart , you can say anything to us , you know that . I think I 'm old enough for you to tell me who my real parents are . Of course , you are . Honey ! I 'm home ! Your father ... Hey , honey . Bad Mr. Mubbles ! No ! - I 'm glad you 're home . - Oh , me too . I 've such a headache . I slammed my head getting out of a taxi cab . Hi , daddy ! Hey , baby ! I 'm just saying it 's impossible , okay ? - Nobody can predict the future . - I saw it with my own eyes , Peter . Isaac ! I brought someone here to help . He 's a nurse . Isaac ! Isaac ! Isaac ! isaac Simone Oh God ! Okay . - Oh my God ! Isaac ? - He 's alive . - Call 911 . - Yes . What have you done ? God , he 's overdosed . Yeah , I 'm at 215 Reed Street . Number 7 . I need an ambulance here immediately . he 's OD no , no , he 's conscious Just barely . I know . Listen , could you just come and get here soon , please . Okay , baby , it 's okay . they 'rr sending an ambance right away , okay ? you just hang in there , okay ? You 're gonna be okay , I swear . We have to stop it . We have to stop it . This quest , this need to solve life 's mysteries . In the end what does it matter when the human heart can only find a meaning the smallest of moments . They 're here . Among us . In the shadows , in the light . Everywhere . Do they even know yet ? All right , I 'm here . Now what do you want ? Peter ? I 've been up here all night . Thinking about this . Thinking about my destiny . What you doing , Pete ? It 's my turn to be somebody now , Nathan . Come on , Peter . Quit screwing around . Peter ! You 're flying nathen You 're flying ... How did you I don 't know . no

 All drivers to your cars , please . All drivers to your cars . - Distracted ? - No , that 's not exactly right . Your son seems to be interested in only one thing . All he talks about , all he seems capable of thinking about is automobile racing . Well , you know , his father designs racing cars . And where is your husband ? Working . He couldn 't be here . Perhaps the apple hasn 't fallen very far from the tree . Is your husband 's name Rex ? No , that 's his older brother , Rex . Why ? This is the test he turned in last week . Hm . All right , pencils down . Take your answer sheets , place it into the first part of your booklet pack up your things and bring your ... to my desk . Speed Racer , slow down ! Take it you 're ready to go ? - How was school ? - Fine . Are you going to the track ? Mom said you were . You don 't have to drop me off . I could just go with you . - No way . - Oh , come on . Take me with you . Come on , please . I can 't , Speed . - Pops would kill me . - He doesn 't have to know . I won 't say anything . Nobody will know . Come on , please , Rex . Please , please , please . Are you wearing the socks ? Hm ? Hm ? Okay . But if you roll us again , this 'll be the last time . Deal ? Deal . Oh , yeah ! Come on ! Yee-haw ! You feel that shimmy ? It 's your hind legs trying to outrun your front . What do I do ? You stop steering and you start driving . This ain 't no dead piece of metal . A car is a living , breathing thing , all right ? She 's alive . You can feel her talking to you , telling you what she wants , what she needs . Listen . Close your eyes and listen . They say that Ben Burns drove the final lap of the Vanderbilt Cup with his eyes closed . - No way ! - No ? Maybe you just can 't hear it , then . Ought to start hitting those books . - No , I hear it ! - Oh , is that so , Mr. Burns ? All right . Tell me when to punch it for the jump . - Now ? - Uh-uh . Now ! Local fan favorite Speed Racer is gobbling up this track . Let us hope he does not make the same mistakes that his brother made . Heads up , Speed . Seven o 'clock . I got Snake drafting Pitter-Pat . I got him . I figure he 'll slingshot after you in the next turn . I 'm ready . Great move , Speed ! All right , watch out for the dog balls coming up . You may wanna ease off a little . Not this time , Sparky . Holy cannoli , Speed . - You know who you 're racing ? - Yeah . Rex is gonna win it , ain 't he , Pops ? Nobody 's gonna catch him . He 's gonna win it . He 's gonna set the course record . Nobody 's gonna stop him . - Quiet . There 's still a lot of race to go . - No way . It 's over . My brother 's the best racer in the world . Everyone else is running for second . Yeah ! I told you to take him out ! We 're trying , sir , we 're trying , but he 's just too fast . It 's unbelievable , folks ! No one has seen moves like this since that remarkable night eight years ago . There 's no doubt in my mind . He 's gunning for the record . He is not alone out there , he is chasing someone . He is chasing the ghost of Rex Racer . Jeepers , he could do it , Pops . He could really do it . What if he does it ? What if he does it , Pops ? I don 't know if I can watch this . There 's that Speed Racer . My daddy told me that his daddy used to work for the Mishida Motorwerks but he quit . My daddy told me that it was a completely crazy thing to do . He says the whole family is crazy . Speed 's not crazy . No . He 's just dumb . Probably the dumbest kid in the class . Mrs. Waterstraat had me alphabetize the IRB tests and you wouldn 't believe what the retard did . Speed ! Speed ! Are you all right ? Who are you ? I 'm Trixie . I 'm in your class . Oh , yeah . Hey , you wanna see my car collection ? I 'd love to . Hey , Rex . Hey , Pops . - Hey , Speedy . - Who 's your friend ? Her name 's Trixie . She 's in my class . - Hi . - Pleasure to meet you , young lady . Hey , Pops , a guy told me to give this to you . Says he was a big fan . Oh . A fan , is it ? Well , it 's not every day we get people with such good taste around here . - Where is he ? - He was in a hurry , driving a ' 68 Fendersin . - Sweet set of wheels . - Let me see that . Cool beans . No one from these parts will ever forget the tragic story of Rex Racer . He nearly ruined racing . One of the bravest men to ever drive a racecar . Can I come with you , Rex ? Not this time , Speedy . When are you coming back ? I don 't know . I don 't know . Hey , there 's something I want you to have . But the Mach 5 's your car . Not anymore . Look , Speed one day , people might say things about me . But no matter what they say I just ... Look , I hope you never believe them . I won 't . Come here . So you 're quitting ? I have to . No , you don 't . This is a choice . You 're selling out . Turning your back on everything we built here . I 'm done arguing with you , Pops . Don 't you turn your back on me . You can 't tell me what to do . It 's my life to live . You walk out that door now , you better not ever come back . Rex Racer , driving the black-and-red Uniron car got into a tangle with Richenbach , who was favored to win . That was no tangle . He took Richenbach out . Well , we don 't know that but I imagine the WRL will be reviewing this crash . That 's the third DNF crash Racer 's been in . - Turn it off , Speed . - They ought to just suspend him . I don 't want you watching this anymore . The trial of Rex Racer shook the World Racing League to its very foundation . Once a rat , always a rat and in my book , Rex Racer 's nothing but a rat . Did you see that ? That will definitely leave a mark . And Rex Racer nearly took Yokima 's head off with that jump . Hey , there is no doubt in my mind that Rex Racer is one of the dirtiest drivers in the world . For five years , Rex Racer took orders from the criminal underworld . KIDS Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! No ! You stop this ! You stop it right now ! I just told him the truth ! His crumbum brother doesn 't belong on a racetrack , he belongs in jail ! The indictment brought down the perennial racing powerhouse , Uniron . Uniron was linked to the notorious fixer , Blackjack Benelli . Still in prison today Benelli was rumored to be behind the Casa Cristo tragedy . This is one of the worst crashes I have ever s ... REPORTER How could this happen ? This is terrible . This is just terrible . And still no sign of driver Rex Racer . Oh . I know . CROWD Go ! Go ! Go ! ALL Go ! Go ! Go ! " Forget the past , " he 's saying . " This is my night ! " - He 's coming hard . - It 's gonna be close ! Unbelievable ! A split second late . The record still stands . Come on , let 's go . Victory Lane . Folks , I knew Rex Racer , and if he 's up there somewhere watching this race you can bet your ass he 's damn proud of his little brother . ANNOUNCER Pulling into Victory Lane , the winner , Speed Racer ! He 's going to be very good . No , he 's going to be the best if they don 't destroy him first . Hi-ya ! KEN : Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Hey , hey ! What are you two doing ? Nothing . Was that the same nothing that broke my last couch ? No , that was a totally different nothing . Got it ! - Racer residence . - Morning . - May I speak to Speed Racer ? - He 's not interested . Spritle ? - What ? Was that for Speed ? Yeah , but Speed doesn 't wanna talk to them . You don 't know that . Sure , I do . Speed 's gotta drive for Pops . He 's gotta . Well , that 's for Speed to decide . Now get dressed . - Tell your father breakfast is ready . - Ooh . " It was a virtuoso display of talent which has not been seen since Racer the elder dropped jaws eight years ago . As we once again pull our collective jaw up from the floor , we ask : - ' Will it be different or will tragedy ... ? " ' - That 's enough . I can 't believe there 's not one mention of Racer Motors in here . That 's because the sponsors control the media , Sparky . Good morning , everyone . - Good morning . - Is Speed up yet ? - In spirit , anyway . Oh , thanks . - Hey , superstar . - Hey , Trix . Have you seen the papers ? They 're all in love with you . Really ? Yeah . There seems to be a lot of speculation about which team you 'll sign with . Really ? - What the ... ? - Earthquake ! Earthquake ! Quick , Pops ! The kitchen is the most dangerous place in an earthquake . - Everybody , run for your life ! - Spritle , calm down ! Mr. Racer , morning . What ? Oh , um , may I ? Oh ! Mr. and Mrs. Racer , I hope you will forgive this imposition . These are bluebells from Eden , Inc . I 'm told they 'll bloom at least three times , each time a different color . And Mr. Racer , these are for you . Straight from the Isle of Kamut , hand-rolled , premium blend . Thanks , but who are you ? I am E.P. Arnold Royalton , Esquire president and chairman of Royalton Industries . And it is my honor to meet you both . Oh , dear , I seem to have interrupted your breakfast . Is that pancakes I smell ? Oh , are you hungry , Mr. Royalton ? A figure like mine requires constant attention , Mrs. Racer . And do you like pancakes ? When I was a child , we used to say : Pancakes are love . Mm . Mm . Gorgeous , Mrs. Racer . Superb density . Hints of vanilla . Cinnamon ? - That 's right . - Absolutely gorgeous . - Well , I 'm glad you like them . - Like them ? I wanna buy your recipe . - Oh ! I 'll give you the recipe , Mr. Royalton . - Nonsense ! Cenestro Foods , a subdivision of Royalton Industries is planning a range of homecooked meals for travelers and this is just the kind of magic we 're looking for . I 'll have my attorney draw up the paperwork . Hmm . Now , then , we all know the reason I 'm here is because of you , Speed . I was watching last night and I have to tell you , young man , you gave me goose bumps . I knew at once this was no mere driver I was watching . This was an artist . Oh ... I imagine the phone 's been ringing off the hook . Yeah . But Speed doesn 't wanna drive for you or any other sponsors . Is this your manager , then ? - That 's our youngest , Spritle . - Nice to meet you , youngster . We got our eye on you , mister . Excellent . The first thing I want to make clear is that I have no intention whatsoever of trying to get Speed away from Racer Motors . What you have here is what teams spend years and millions of dollars trying to achieve , chemistry . I wouldn 't dare touch a thing . Well , excuse me for asking , but what do you want ? To help . I want to make sure you have access to whatever resources you need to continue doing exactly what you 're doing . No offense , Royalton , but Racer Motors has always run as an independent . None taken . I completely understand . I sympathize . - Strike that . I empathize . - Hmm . You may think of R.I. as a huge corporate conglomerate but I will have you know I still remember working all night on a Commodore 64 in the basement of my foster parents ' home . I built R.I. from below the ground up . So while Royalton Industries may look like a major sponsor to you it remains in my heart as independent to me as the first day I quit my job at GloBoCom to start working for myself . Now , then I 've had this wonderful opportunity to meet your family . All I 'm asking for is the chance to introduce you to mine . I 've never flown so low through the city . Special permit . Only six of them are granted a year . Take whatever you like . Thank you . Spritle ! - What ? She said we could have some . All right , maybe one apiece . Hey , look , that 's the Grand Prix Colosseum . My brother 's gonna win the Grand Prix someday . No doubt in my mind , young man . Given the right circumstances , no doubt in my mind whatsoever . This is Gennie , our talent manager . Ask for anything . Her job is to make it come true . Hello , Speed . Welcome to Royalton . - What 's this ? - To make an informed decision you 'll have to understand how we take care of our drivers . All aboard . Oh , cool ! Royalton Tower is the crown jewel among the properties that I control . It functions as the corporate headquarters for the top 12 divisions of our parent corp . One big industrious family . Our vertically integrated plant is the fastest in the world from initial carbon bond to finished car in 36 hours . How long does it take at Racer Motors ? - Mmm ... - Several weeks , at least . This kind of production facility could be at your disposal , Mr. Racer . Hm . Yeah . This is our operating theater where our patented Refusion Distributor is installed in the turbine drive . Is that an Inner-Positive Transponder ? We control the only transponder foundry in the world outside of Musha Motors . Oops . Sorry , trade secret . As you know , a T-180 driver 's got to be in peak physical condition . No expense is spared to ensure that when our drivers suit up they are as perfectly tuned as the machines they are controlling . The best drivers must be able to withstand over four G 's of force in a typical race . The will to win is nothing without the will to prepare . And at Team Royalton , we prepare our drivers for any eventuality and every possible condition . I hope I didn 't scare you , Speed , with how hard we push our team . I just wanted you to see how committed we are to winning . - I get that . - Good . Because I also want you to understand that R.I. isn 't all work and no play . That 's Cannonball Taylor . Stop the car . Jack . Jack , come here . There 's someone I 'd like you to meet . Speed Racer . Allow me to introduce two-time Grand Prix winner five-time WRL Champion and future hall of famer Jack " Cannonball " Taylor . Oh ... Honor to meet you . Caught that Thunderhead replay . Nice piece of work . Wow . Thanks . There was a rumor you might be visiting . It 's pretty impressive . Only thing I cared about was that wall over there . That 's what sold me . You want to win in this league , you 're talking to the right guy . Thanks , Jack . Sweet ! We treat our thoroughbreds the way they deserve to be treated . - Sweet ! - There 's a full maid service , of course with personal chef and masseurs available 24 / 7 . Sweet ! Thank you . It should be perfect . Try it on . Mm-hm . Okay . So , Mrs. Racer what do you think about my family ? Impressed ? - You could say that . - Good . Because I want you to understand the possibilities that exist for your son now . What 's wrong , Mr. Racer ? To be honest , Royalton , I 'm feeling more intimidated than impressed . This kind of company scares me . People like you have way too much money . When someone gets that kind of money , they think that the rules everybody else plays by don 't mean squat to them . However , my sons are the most important thing I 've ever done in my life besides marrying my best friend . And if Speed wants us to figure out some kind of an alliance then you can bet your ass we 'll be in business . Ah . Hubba-hubba . - Oh , honey , you look so handsome . - Yeah ? Very sharp , Speed . Suits you perfectly . Regardless of what happens , I want you to have it as a gift . Thanks , Mr. Royalton . So how are you feeling , Speed ? It 's very impressive . You think that maybe there 's something that could work out here ? I guess I 'd like to think about it , if I could . This isn 't the kind of offer I go around making every day , son . No , I understand that , sir . So if I had to give you an answer now , then to be honest ... Stop right there . You 're right . You should think about it . I 'm sure you 're feeling a bit overwhelmed . You should take a little time think about what you saw and heard here , and we 'll get together early next week . - Deal ? - Deal . I thought we had a deal . I thought we were friends . Well , maybe where you come from , that 's how you treat your friends . But around here , we don 't take too kindly to it , do we , fellas ? It hurts our feelings . Problem is I like you , Taejo . And I 've got a real soft spot in my heart for that sister of yours . And normally , under circumstances such as this we 'd be pouring you a nice ... But I think I thought of another solution . How are my babies , huh ? Hungry ? Ready for seconds ? Boys . No ! Don 't worry , it only hurts for a few seconds , then you 'll probably black out . No , please ! It 'll be hard to drive with skellie hands . No , please . - You even think about turning rat and next time it 's your sister going in there ! - What ? - Someone 's tailing us . - Is it him ? - It could be . - Oh , God . - It 's him ! Crush him ! He 's out front . Got you . - Boss ! - My babies . My babies ! Put your finger in there . Do it ! Nice fishies , nice fishes . No , no , no . We can 't take another hit , boss ! Aah ! - Pull over . But don 't stop . Are you hurt ? No . Then get up . Thank you . You saved my life . I didn 't save anything worth saving unless you get smart real fast . You thought you could take on the cartel . You can 't . Not without help . I don 't know what you 're talking about . You have been on Cruncher Block 's leash for so long maybe you forgot how it feels to stand up and be a man . The only way you 'll ever stop these people is to bring them to justice . Justice ? That 's a commodity I don 't waste my money on . Hm . Get out . - I 'll see you at Fuji . - You won 't finish . When you lose , if you can still dial a phone call this number . You 're really considering signing with Royalton . - I just said it was tempting . - Why ? Well , they got a really good team . Cannonball Taylor , Maggie Manifold . They win a lot of majors . And since when did winning become so important ? It is important . You gotta win if you wanna keep driving , and that 's what I wanna do . - It 's the only thing I really know how to do . - That 's not true . Come on . I wouldn 't have made it out of high school without your help . Okay , well , that 's true . But when I 'm in a T-180 , I don 't know , everything just makes sense . So are you saying this doesn 't make sense ? Okay , this makes sense too . Oh . So you like this ? Yeah . This ain 't so bad . I was starting to wonder . Wonder what ? Well , with you so busy becoming Mr. Super-Famous-Racecar-Driver I was starting to wonder if you were still interested in this . - You know I am . - Do I ? What , like you forgot ? - Maybe I need a reminder . - A reminder . Sometimes a girl could use a reminder . You mean like a new igniter for your helicopter ? Mm-mm . Well , how about a tire burn that spells out your name ? Warmer . Maybe at the end of some big race , when I pull into Victory Lane I scoop you up and kiss you , with thousands of flashbulbs going off . Would that be so terrible , Mr. Super-Famous-Racecar-Driver ? I don 't know . - Maybe we should practice . - Maybe we should . Oh , God , I 'm gonna hurl . - Spritle . - He did not . - Ooh , Spritle . - You little sneak . - It wasn 't my idea . - Oh , no ? - It was his . - Wait till we tell Pops . No , don 't do that . We couldn 't sleep . We just wanted to hang out . We didn 't know you were going to In-spew-ation Point . By the way , cootie shot . I 'm taking you home . Wait . Wait . Can we stop for ice cream first ? The new GRX has a supercharged Inner-Positive Transponder and will be capable of speeds in excess of 800 kilometers an hour . If such a car were to win the Grand Prix this year one would expect the demand for transponders to increase dramatically . One would expect . And if a single company gained control of all the transponder foundries in the world one might expect that company to do very well for itself . You know what I want . I know for the last few years you 've been trying to buy out your main rival , Tetsua Togokahn . The question is , can we make a deal ? Deliver Togokahn at that price and the transponder foundry is yours . Done . - Speed ! - Mr. Royalton . Welcome ! Come here . Look at this . Oh . Wow . That 's what I thought . We 're still working on the R and R , but it 's getting there . Come , sit . We can talk logos later . Can I get you something to drink ? Water ? Bubbly ? A shot of rye ? No . I 'm okay . So I can see you 've been giving some serious thought to this thing . - I have . Yes , sir . - Good . Means you understand we 're talking about not just your future but your family 's future . My family means a lot to me . I know . I can tell . That 's why this is so important , because you can help them . All you have to say is yes . That 's all I need to hear and I can make so many things happen for you and your family . You ready for that ? You ready to say yes , Speed ? Jackpot . Oh , boy , oh , boy . This isn 't an easy decision for me , Mr. Royalton . For my family , racing 's everything . I was tooling timing pins with Pops while I was still wearing diapers . I mean , there 's nothing more perfect than a picnic at Thunderhead . But when my brother died , all that went away . I can 't tell you how painful that was . It nearly killed all of us . Especially Pops . He didn 't set foot in his shop for over a year . But one night , when I was still pretty young , I couldn 't sleep and I went into the living room , and there was Pops in his beat-up robe watching some old race recordings . So I sat with him there watching old Ben Burns coming around the last turn of the 43 Prix and all of a sudden , Pops started screaming . Go ! And then I started screaming . As Burns and Stickleton headed for the finish we were cheering our heads off . And the second the black-and-white came down we looked at each other and we realized racing 's in our blood . But for Pops it isn 't just a sport . It 's way more important than that . It 's like a religion . And in our house , the major sponsors are kind of like the devil . I don 't mean to offend you , sir , and I do appreciate your offer but after all we 've been through I don 't think this kind of deal 's for me . You poor , naive chump . I 'll pretend I didn 't hear that sickening schmaltz and I 'll give you an education . At the end , if you 're smart you 'll thank me and then you 'll sign that contract . Huh ? Huh ? Jig 's up . Holy moly . Hey . This is Marvin , down at the landing pad . I think we got mice again . All right . We 'll send someone over to take care of it . Over . Look . There is the true spirit of the golden age of racing . Benjamin Braddack , Reginald White , George Wheeler , Diamond Dave Tewksbury and Oliver Potter . The five most powerful men in the world at the turn of the last century . For all intents and purposes , they created the modern automotive industry . But the true stroke of their genius was the invention of the WRL the world 's first racing league . Interesting that you and your father were so moved by the 43 Prix . One of the great finishes in the history of racing , right ? Everyone remembers Burns and Stickleton slugging it out . But who remembers Carl Potts ? Driving this rebuilt Wittigan for Iodyne Industries Potts spun out in the second lap and went down as a DNF a forgettable and pathetic finish . So bad that afterwards , Iodyne stock dropped six points . But as Ben Burns sat guzzling cold , fresh milk in Victory Lane a thousand cameras taking his picture Sirrus Aeronautics saw almost a 12-point gain which blocked Peninsula Power Cell from being able to afford the price of a takeover . This put Joel Goldman , the CEO of Iodyne , Inc. in the exact position he wanted to be in . By first buying controlling interest in his own company at a devalued price he then brokered a merger with Sirrus that sent Iodyne into the gains record book the only record book that matters . Look out that window . There isn 't a single plane or helicopter or K-Harrier that isn 't powered by Iodyne fuel cells . That 's what racing is about . It has nothing to do with cars or drivers . All that matters is power and the unassailable might of money . Whoo ! Dude ! Yeah ! Oh , no ! Woo-hoo ! Get out of the way ! Out of the way ! Get out of the way ! You understand ? Burns knew he was going to win . It was already decided . A week before the Prix , Goldman and Sirrus met with other major players at the Cargyle Hotel . They met there as they had for years . They met to negotiate the finish order of the Grand Prix . No race is more important and no race is more controlled . Goldman was supposed to win , but he knew if he sold his win whatever that win might be worth was nothing compared to what could be gained . That 's why I spent $ 3 million on this burnt and twisted lump of metal . Because it reminds me of what really matters . This is the true heart of racing , boy . This is my religion . You don 't know how often I 've seen that same cow-eyed " say it isn 't so " look of disbelief . Every bumpkin who comes in from the sticks looks exactly as you do now . I won 't bother proving it to you . You walk away from me and this deal , you 'll know how true it is soon enough . So last chance . You ready to put away your toys and grow up ? Are you ready to make more money in one year than your father made in his life ? Are you ready to become a real racecar driver ? Then sign that contract ! Spearhook . What 's this ? If that 's your idea of racing , you can keep it . Listen to me and listen good because I 'm gonna give you one more history lesson . You 're gonna go to Fuji and try and prove everything I told you is nothing but a lie . But no matter how well you drive , you won 't win , you won 't place . I guarantee you right now , you won 't even finish the race . Speed Racer 's making his move , gunning for the lead . Ha ! The Harbinger of Boom once again leaves his mark a trail of carnage and chaos cartwheeling behind him ! - Oh , but the fans love it , don 't they ? - They do , God help them . They 're about to get more as Iodyne is now slugging it out with young Taejo Togokahn . Whoo ! Oh , terrible crash ! They 'll have to fish Taejo and Billy Ray out of the drink . But this race is far from over . Right now , one car stands between Speed Racer and the lead : - The Grey Ghost . - We got ourselves a real race here ! Show me what you got . Show me what you got ! Woo-hoo ! - Speed , get out of there ! - I can 't . I can 't move ! Soon after that , there will be litigation against some of your father 's designs . Are you Pops Racer of Racer Motors ? - Yeah , but I 'm still on vacation . - You are hereby served a summons . - What ? - You are being sued for IP infringement by Janus Automakers . - No way ! - That 's ridiculous . That 's for a jury to decide . The legitimacy of the lawsuits won 't matter . They 'll be enough to discredit his company . Whatever contracts he has , he 'll lose . Within a year , he 'll be filing for bankruptcy . After that , you and the rest of your pathetic family will be history . Pops is right . You are the devil . Mr. Royalton . - What ? ! - Speed ! - Spritle ? I found these two sneaking around a restricted area . Get this Racer trash out of my building . - I 'll see you in Fuji . - Yes . And then you 'll find out you just made the biggest mistake of your life ! Hey , kid . - Ben Burns ? - Nice race . I ain 't seen moves like that in a long time . It didn 't matter , I still lost . Yeah . Tough break . Well , good luck . Mr. Burns , can I ask you something ? Sure , kid . The 43 Prix . Did you know you were gonna win ? You know , everybody thought that me and Stickleton hated each other . Funny , ain 't it ? " Controversy surrounds Racer Motors , now embroiled in IP litigation . And while evidence remains inconclusive whether or not Speed used an illegal device the Fuji-Helexicon seems destined to become another mark of shame added to the notorious Racer family legacy a legacy that has forever tainted the integrity of this ... " Sparky . Sorry , ma 'am . I 'm gonna send that guy some Chim Chim cookies . - You 'll do no such thing . - We gotta do something , Pops . This is exactly what he said would happen if I didn 't drive for him . He 's just trying to scare you . They tried the same thing with Rex . It 's a fight they want , it 's a fight they 'll get . How ? What can we do ? How can we fight this ? The truth 'll come out . The truth ? Don 't be naive , Pops . Speed ? Are you all right ? I don 't know . It 's gonna be okay . We 'll work this out . I don 't know , Mom . I may have really messed things up . How ? By not joining Royalton . Oh , don 't be silly . You never would have been happy racing for that terrible man . Maybe that 's not the point . Maybe Royalton 's right and racing 's all about business and anyone who doesn 't understand that is just a chump . Now you listen to me , young man . What you do behind the wheel of a racecar has nothing to do with business . Before you could even talk , you were making noises that sounded like an engine . We tried to take you to the park and you never wanted to get out of the car . I loved that old wagon . And you remember when Rex took you out to Thunderhead and let you drive ? And I turned it over . Oh , my heart starts pounding just thinking about it . Mom ! Yeah , you should 've seen it ! Yeah ! Rex told me the only reason we survived was because I was wearing red socks . I thought your father would have a heart attack when you came in with that crazy smile . Speed , when I watch you do some of the things you do I feel like I 'm watching someone paint or make music . I go to the races to watch you make art . And it 's beautiful and inspiring and everything that art should be . Even though there are times when I have to close my eyes . But then there are other times when you just take my breath away . And it 's at those moments when I feel your father 's chest swell and I know that he 's smiling because he 's pretending that he doesn 't have tears in his eyes that I just go to pieces . Why ? Because I am so impossibly proud to be your mom . It 's gonna be okay , honey . You 'll see . We 'll work this out . We just have to stick together and something good will happen . You 'll see . Racer X ! The Harbinger of Boom ! Run for your lives ! What are you two squawking about ? Pops , whatever you do , don 't open that door . This is a bad idea . If it was any other driver , you 'd be here . Inspector Detector . Good morning , Mr. Racer . I know it 's been a long time . Ten years . We 've been after Royalton for years for dozens of capital corporate crimes including WRL fixing , but we haven 't had the evidence we needed to convict him until now . What 's he doing here ? Racer X works closely with our WRL Corporate Crimes Division helping us recruit drivers like you , Speed . Why does he always wear that mask ? If any of you knew his identity , you 'd become targets for his enemies which include some of the most vicious fixers in the world . What do you want with me ? Are you familiar with the driver Taejo Togokahn ? - Of course . - For years he 's been contracted by a fixer named Cruncher Block . Recently , Taejo 's been forced to lose races , and he began resisting thinking that he could do it on his own . - After Fuji , he realized he needed help . - Why help him ? Because he has a file with enough information to connect Block to Royalton which could put both of them behind bars for the rest of their lives . The problem is , he won 't give us the file unless we help him stop the takeover of his family 's company . How ? There 's an upcoming race that Taejo believes if he can win it 'll catapult Togokahn Motors into the spotlight double the cost of the buyout , which should kill it . There aren 't any more races left except the Grand Prix and we both failed to qualify . Ahem . There aren 't any more track races . This is a cross-country rally . Casa Cristo . What ? I know it seems cruel of me to ask . Taejo made it clear he had to have Speed and X on his team or there would be no deal . - Absolutely not . - You 'll have the support of the entire C.I.B. - No . Rally racing is a back-alley sport filled with jackals , headhunters and thugs . I 'm sorry , but I 've already lost one son to that deathtrap . I won 't lose another . I understand . - If you change your mind ... - Keep your card , Chief Inspector . Thank you for your time . But Pops 'll never let you go . He won 't if I ask him . Speed Racer , what are you thinking ? You weren 't in Royalton 's office , Trix . You don 't know what it was like . It felt as though he had his hand inside my chest and he was trying to crush everything in my life that mattered to me . All right . Let 's do it . You 're gonna need an alibi . We 'll say we 're going skiing . What ? No way . You 're gonna need my help . Casa Cristo is a rally . I can spot from a copter . Trixie , this isn 't a game . These people play rough . I know . That 's why I 'm going with you . If you even try to argue with me , I 'll tell Pops and he 'll never let you out of his sight . You would , wouldn 't you ? Well I guess we 're going skiing . We 're just minutes away from the start of the 82nd annual Casa Cristo Classic the grande dame of cross-country , the second-oldest rally race in the world spanning two continents , three climate changes and 5,000 kilometers of the most winding and treacherous roads ever raced . With me again is five-time Casa Cristo champion ... Spritle . - ... Johnny " Goodboy " Jones . What are you two doing ? Just watching a little TV , Pops . It 's his favorite show . - It 's in German . - Not the monkey parts . Oh , no , you don 't . You are not watching that race . Out you go . Outside . Get some exercise . You 're too pale . Speed . I want you to understand how much the C.I.B. appreciates your help on this . I 'm not doing this to help the C.I.B. I don 't know anything about corporate crimes and if I did , it wouldn 't really matter . I 'm doing this because someone 's trying to hurt my family and I 'm gonna do everything I can to hurt him back . Safety has been a primary concern for Casa Cristo officials , especially the last few years . That 's right . There were a number of fatalities years ago . It really had a bad reputation . Fans started calling it " The Crucible . " These are some of the most dangerous drivers in the world . And we expect they 'll do anything they can to stop you . Their cars will probably be equipped with secret weapons so we 've modified the Mach 5 to try to counter their attacks . The A button will operate your normal jump-jacks . B will seal your cockpit , which we fortified with bulletproof polymer . Should someone go after your tires with , say , a hidden shank or shredder the C button will activate your tire shields . However , in the event of any blowout D will inflate a Hexadyno emergency spare . E will activate these zircon-tipped saw blades . They 'll cut through almost anything . Use with discretion . F will project the tire crampons . Finally , G will launch a remote-control homing bird that is capable of transmitting U-CAP footage anywhere you are . Every race fan has heard the rumors of spearhooks , tire shanks , battery boosters . Oh , no . While it 's true there have been a few bad apples on the whole , most teams stay within league rules . Or at least try not to get caught . This is wrong , what you are trying to do . Musha 's price is an insult to five generations of our family . And if you die ? Then will the price be high enough ? - I have no choice . - Why ? He is your father too . I finally understand it now , Trix . I know why he left us . He was trying to change this rotten business and they killed him for it . A lot of drivers believe that the hardest part of Cristo is the start . The Muqranna ? - Yeah , those archways are tricky . And speaking of starts , here comes the queen of Casa Cristo now . The moment the queen sees the sun , she 'll signal the start . No , no , no . This is supposed to be my race . I 'm supposed to win . I got the green light . They promised I would go to the Grand Prix . For eight years , I played by the rules ! - This is supposed to be my race ! - Enough ! I can 't stand the whining . Like a baby needing its diaper changed . It 's simple . We have a team of wild cards . The problem is , these wild cards are better drivers than you . What ? Like hell they are ! Prove it . Take out Taejo and the other two will quit . You just watch me . Come on ! I got Racer . This team Taejo Togokahn 's put together looks like they mean business . As they head out of the city and into the Zunubian Desert the team leading the pack is Snake Oiler ! Let 's pinch these turds off . Come on ! We are falling behind ! Speed ! On your right , Flying Foxes ! Got them . Headhunters . They 're not alone . - Oh , no . - Speed Racer has a blowout ! Move it , Speed . It 's getting ugly out there . Okay , no more Mr. Nice-Guy . Hurry , Speed , they need you ! Where have you been ? Have any of these drivers read the rulebook ? See ? This race is full of cheaters . It 's tough to see what goes on in those dust clouds . It can get really nasty in there . Watch the backdraft . You want some ? Come on ! Thor-Azine , yeah ! Wing left . Flying in . - Lead them . - Here you go . Ha-ha ! Watch the blind side ! Broom Hilda ! Crom ! Taejo ! - Oh , my God , did I just see that ? - A rear single-set jump into a flying kick . I know he blew up at Fuji , but this kid is flat-out magic . I 'm going into town for some parts . I 'll be back for lunch . Sure thing , Pops . Hm ? Mm . Let 's go ! - The Togokahn Team is fighting their way ... - Game on . ... back into the race behind the electrifying driving of Speed Racer . The fans are getting their money 's worth . Honey , I can 't find my wallet . Spritle ! - You two are in big trouble . - Wait . Wait , before you get mad at us , look ! I 'm not falling for that . - It 's Speed ! - Speed 's skiing ! Then who 's driving the Mach 5 ? - relentless as the eight remaining teams slice their way through the aqueducts of Sassicaia . Oh , no . As we near the end of the first leg of the Casa Cristo , one team has dominated . And here they come through the streets of Cortega , heading for the finish . Yeah ! If we drive tomorrow like we drove today , we will lose ! You will get nothing . All of this will be meaningless ! Relax . Snake 's weak on turns . We 'll catch him in the mountains . We might , if you stop showing off . Hey , all I was doing was saving your ass . Don 't fall apart yet . There 's still a lot of race to run . A C.I.B. man will be posted outside your door . We got their attention today . You and Trixie should be very careful tonight . Racer X. I thought we made a good team today . It felt like we 've been doing it for a long time . If you say so . Ineptitude . Is this what I pay you for ? ! They ain 't checkered yet . If they do , I assure you it 'll be a very costly mistake for everyone . It was very weird , Trix . I knew every move he was gonna make and he knew mine . It was so familiar . Maybe I 'm crazy , but Racer X first showed up two years after Rex 's death . But , Speed , we buried Rex . A body was buried . Remember , it had already been badly burned in the crash . Even if it was Rex , no one could have recognized him . So you think he faked the crash with a different body in the driver 's seat ? Somehow the kwik-save was disconnected . Inspector Detector suspected foul play , but nothing could be proved . Do you really think Rex could put everyone through all that ? Maybe he felt he didn 't have any other choice . I 'm sorry to disturb you , sir , but do you know these people ? Yeah . Is this the kind of driver I have ? Someone who disobeys ? Someone who lies to me ? Is this the kind of son I 've raised ? And you , Trixie . You know what this race did to this family . Did either of you stop and think about us ? That 's all I 've been thinking about , Pops . You , Mom , Spritle , Sparky . Yeah , you too , Chim Chim . We 're in serious trouble , Pops , and it 's all my fault . This is not the place or race to do anything about that . - Why not ? - Because it won 't do any good . You don 't know that . You think you can drive a car and change the world ? It doesn 't work like that . Maybe not . But it 's the only thing I know how to do , and I gotta do something . That 's unacceptable . This is over . Pack your things . We 're going home . I can 't . I 'm sorry , Pops . What ? - I 'm staying . - So am I. No , you 're not . We 're going home right now ! I 'm not a child , Pops . You can 't tell me how to live my life . If you wanna fire me as your driver , then , fine , do it . But it won 't change the fact that I am going to finish this race . God , you sound like Rex ! You wanna die like him too ? Will that make you happy ? Don 't take it out on me because you feel guilty for Rex ! Okay , you two , that 's enough . Pops . If they 're staying , we 're staying . Woo-hoo ! Room service ! And I suggest that we all find a way to go home together . - Where 's the Mach 5 ? - Logged with security . - You added something to it , didn 't you ? - Some defensive modifications . Whole thing 's out of balance , isn 't it ? It pulls left , rides a little stiff . - Mmm . Sparky ! - Huh ? I 'm sorry , Mom . Your father loves you . It 's just ... I know . It 's gonna be okay . You wouldn 't lie to your mother , would you ? Never again . I got him , Speed ! I got him ! I got him ! Still got him ! Speed ! Attack ! Hi-ya ! What 's going on out there ? Uh-oh . Ooh ! You attack my family . You try to hurt my sons . Here we go ! What 's going ... ? Whoa . Oh , my God . Was that a ninja ? More like a non-ja . Terrible what passes for a ninja these days . Cool beans . Oh , I 'm sorry . I was looking for Speed Racer . Horuko . Are you all right ? No . Something terrible has happened . Narcolyte benzamine . A highly effective and debilitating drug . Stays in the system for hours , but leaves with no trace . I 'll be fine by morning . No , you won 't . You can 't drive a car . You can barely stand up . You do not tell me what I can do . Taejo . What are we gonna do ? The second leg of the Casa Cristo is under way and the stage is set for what might be one of the most ferocious rallies we 've seen in years . This is my race . She 's leaving the hotel now . Wicked sidewinder coming up . Watch the inside-out , could get dicey . Watch your line ! Watch it ! This is abso ... - lutely crazy . Yeah , boss . Signal 's loud and clear . Don 't do it ! On the ground ! Now ! Gotcha . What the ... ? You cheater ! If you 're here , who 's ? That 's better . I couldn 't see a thing . That 's it . Nice line , Trix . Top of the hill 's coming up . Snake 's got about a quarter of a mile on you . All right . Let 's get him . If you 'd been more careful , he wouldn 't be ahead . I told you , I couldn 't see a thing out of this dang helmet . I can 't believe you talked us into this ridiculous idea . What 's ridiculous about it ? You 're always saying I 'm a better driver than most of the WRL . - Now 's not the time to prove it . - Why not ? It 's too dangerous . It 's too dangerous for me , but not for you ? Children , focus . If we 're going to have a chance , we 'll have to pass Snake before the rendezvous . I 'm ready . Let 's roll . Woo-hoo ! Go get them , girl ! Here they come . Let 's pick it up ! - Take him . - With pleasure . Bring it on ! Come on ! Now the gloves are off and they 're pounding one another , bumper to bumper , rail to rail . Take that , Togokahn ! You 're going down ! - Oh , yeah ! - That 's my boy ! Oh , God . Speed . Please ! Please ! Please ! Oh , please ! Please ! Aah ! The Togokahn Team roars into the lead behind some very aggressive driving by Speed Racer . You kidding ? He just tore Snake a new tailpipe . Trix , you all right ? Ten-four . Ready for more . Then let 's move it . We 've got some time to eat up . You 're sure , no cameras here ? No , I checked it this morning . There 's quite a few dead spots in these mountains . What 's he doing here ? Stowaway . We weren 't sure what to do with him . Do what he 'd do . Break his legs and let him walk back . - Thank you so much . - It was a blast . The cell 's reloaded . - Let 's go ! Good luck . Nobody move . Waiting for the Togokahn Team to come out of the pass . Those roads can really ice up . Very dangerous . - What is this ? - This is called a change of plan . Yeah , that 's right . We 're changing your plan that changed our plan to change your plan . Right , boss ? The new plan , what was it ? " Break your legs and make you walk back . " I like that . But first , it 's time to play a little game of peekaboo I see you . - Ow ! - Monkey cookie ! - Nice shot ! - Spritle ? Get that monkey ! Whoa ! Ah ? Ha ! Aw ! Hyah ! Hyah ! Nobody messes with Spark ... Huh ? Looks like another change of plan . Take him away , boys . Spritle ! Go ! Go , go ! No . Oh , no , you don 't . You 're in big trouble . First out of the pass is the Hydra-Cell Team . Uh-oh . They better send the emergency trailer . Wait , is that ... ? Here we go again . Whatever happened in that pass left Togokahn where they started but now only one obstacle stands between Snake Oiler and victory . The Maltese Ice Caves . This is where Rex cr ... Speed , what are you doing ? Are you all right ? - I 'm fine . This next cave 's a rattler . We 'll make our move in there . Now . Ah , not this time , punk . Yahoo ! Speed ! Bye-bye , little turd . Ha-ha-ha ! He did not ! He did not just do that ! Speed Racer is driving straight up a cliff face . Are we getting this ? - Come on ! - Go , Speed , go ! - Hi . Remember me ? - No way . No , no , no ! Not again ! Not again ! Gun ! Snake Oiler completely going out of his mind ! Could have been altitude sickness . It gets crazy . Speed handled it beautifully . And with less than 250 kilometers to go nothing seems to stand between Togokahn and victory . Whoo ! Get me Tetsua Togokahn . Whoo ! Thank you . Whoo ! We make a good team . We did our part . Make sure you do yours . Of course . Congratulations , Mr. Togokahn . - Very impressive race . - Yes , thank you . You 're very generous , Mr. Royalton . Here 's Speed . Does this mean you 've signed with Togokahn ? Uh , no , this was a mutually beneficial opportunity . Yes . Well put . Taejo , will you be running in the Grand Prix this weekend ? We 'll see . Right now I 'm just going to enjoy this victory . Whoo ! The price is 78 a share . That 's outrageous . The price is barely above 50 . This is extortion , blackmail . I 'll sue you , tie up every asset you own for the next 20 years . As you wish , Mr. Royalton . Have a nice day ... Wait . Seventy-eight a share . I 'll have the paperwork drawn up . A pleasure doing business with you . You have done very well for us , my son . - I don 't get it . What just happened ? - Togokahn played us for chumps . He wanted our help to drive up the stock in his family business . Even if he had a file , he wouldn 't turn it over . You mean the whole race was for nothing ? X ? Racer X. Racer X ! Jesus , kid , you can drive . I haven 't been thrown like that in years . What are you doing here ? The inspector told me what happened . I came looking for you . Why would you care ? Because you 're a fighter and a friend . Why don 't you just tell me the truth ? - You 're Rex , aren 't you ? - You mean your brother ? You first appeared two years after Rex died . You drive just like him . You knew I 'd be here , because this is where he always used to take me . Just tell me the truth . You 're not Rex . No , Speed . I 'm sorry , but your brother is dead . - I 'm sorry . - Don 't be . I 'm sure if he was here , he 'd be immensely proud of you . For what ? Making the same mistakes he did ? For trying to make a difference . From what I 've read , that 's all he tried to do . And what good did it do ? He got killed for nothing . Racing hasn 't changed and it never will . It doesn 't matter if racing never changes . What matters is if we let racing change us . Everyone has to find a reason to do this . You don 't climb into a T-180 to be a driver . You do it because you 're driven . If you know so much , why don 't you tell me why I should keep driving ? Sorry . That 's for you to figure out . I just hope when you do that I 'm there to see it . - What you doing ? - What 's it look like ? Where you going ? I don 't know . I just gotta get away from here . Can I come with you , Rex ? - What ? Can we come with you ? - No . - Why not ? You 'll understand when it 's your turn . Speed . Before you go , I 'd like to say a few things . Will you sit with your old man for a minute ? - Don 't try to stop me . - I won 't . Speed , I want you to know I acted rashly . I said things I wish I hadn 't . Your mother usually protects me from making an ass out of myself but I was determined to do it this time , and I guess I did a pretty good job of it . I just wanted to make sure you understood how sorry I was . Thanks . The truth was I couldn 't have been more proud of you , son . Not because you won , but because you stood up , you weren 't afraid and you did what you thought was right . It didn 't amount to anything . It was completely meaningless . How could it be meaningless ? I saw my son become a man . I watched him act with courage and integrity and drive the pants off every other driver on that road . This is not meaningless . This is a reason for a father 's life . I went to Cortega because I was afraid what happened to Rex was gonna happen to you , and I just couldn 't take that . But what I realized at Cortega was I didn 't lose Rex when he crashed . I lost him here . I let him think that a stupid motor company meant more to me than he did . He 'll never know how much I regret that mistake . It 's enough I 'll never make it again . Speed , I understand that every child has to leave home but I want you to know , that door is always open . You can always come back . Because I love you . I love you , Pops . I 'm just so confused right now . I feel like I 'm caught in some kind of a tailspin and no direction makes sense . Yeah , I know what you mean . When Rex died , I didn 't know if I wanted salt on my eggs , let alone keep building cars . But then ... You remember that night we sat together , we watched old Ben Burns and Stickleton ? You remember that ? That night , something just clicked . Like a light being switched on inside of me . After that , I never had trouble remembering how I liked my eggs . Jeez , Pops , that 's just it . That 's part of my problem . - What ? - That race the 43 Prix . Burns and Stickleton ? It was fixed . Royalton told me the whole story . It was all about some DNF named Potts . They 've known the winner of every Grand Prix for the past 50 years . It 's always fixed . Pfft ! I don 't believe that . Royalton 's a crook . You can 't believe a crook . I don 't think he was lying , Pops . The Grand Prix , a sham ? - Horuko . - Forgive me for intruding but I had to come before it was too late . This is not a trick . I swear to you . I 'm not my brother . You gonna ask the lovely lady in ? Yeah , sure . Come on in . - Can I get you something to drink ? - No . My security man believes I 'm still at the opera so I only have a moment . I 'm very sorry for what happened . What my father and brother did was not right , and I 'm ashamed . It 's fine . Just another lesson learned . No . It is they who are in need of a lesson . This rightfully belongs to you . An invitation to compete in the 91 st annual Grand Prix . My brother was planning to decline anyway . But I studied the rules very carefully . And as a member of the winning Togokahn Team if you present this invitation on the day of the race , they must allow you to compete . Ha ! What do you think of that , Mr. It 's-Always-Fixed ? - l ... - You don 't have to say anything . I only hope you drive as you did in Casa Cristo and you wipe the smiles from their faces . We don 't have a car . - Sparky ! - No . No . He 'll yell at me ! - Right here , Pops . - What are you doing in the kitchen ? Same as everyone else . I don 't believe it . You were listening the whole time ? - And I 'm so glad I did . - We were so worried about you . Horuko . Thank you . I would say , " Good luck Saturday , " but you don 't need it . You 're already very lucky to have such a family . - Come on , we got work to do . - The race is less than two days away . How fast did Royalton say he could build that tin can with his machines ? Thirty-six hours . Then we 'll do it in 32 . Come on , let 's go . Cameraman . Ladies and gentlemen , behold the future ! Sparky ? You ready ? Ready , Pops . Pops , that 's a Bernoulli Convergenator . Transponder schmonder . You want real kick , you go Bernoulli . Were you here last year ? - Yes , you were . - No . The Colosseum has begun to fill , final preparations are under way . We 're expecting the largest television audience in Grand Prix history . We 've got an incredible lineup this year , like the Grey Ghost Sonic " Boom-boom " Renaldi , Nitro Venderhoss and The Scarlet Valentine . Not to mention C-Ball . Cannonball Taylor , fastest Grand Prix seed in history driving the new GRX from Royalton Race Cars . - Thanks , doll . - You 're welcome . We 've got an odd-numbered field this year , one shy of a full boat as Taejo Togokahn declined his automatic invitation after winning the Casa Cristo . All right , let 's start her up . Sounds beefy , Pops . Yeah , I gave it a little something extra . Come on , let 's load it up . Hold on . Something 's going on over there . We 're seeing some kind of commotion down at the trailer entrance . Excuse me . Is there a problem here , officer ? Why , you sly dog . Sir , we have a problem . Excuse me . What madness is going on here ? Mr. Royalton , this is a legitimate invitation . We have verified it . - Where did you get this ? - I won it fair and square . This is preposterous . He can 't be allowed to race . It 's too late . The ruling on this is clear . Try to stop it and you 'll be in blatant violation of the WRL charter leaving me no option but to shut this year 's Prix down until a full investigation can be completed . What ? Have you any idea what that would cost ? Are you insane ? Try me . Something big is going on because every race official has ... Wait , wait , an announcement is being made . Now driving in the 40th and final position ... Holy sh * * ! ... for Racer Motors in the Mach 6 , Speed Racer . A million dollars to the driver that takes out Racer . He won 't even get out of the blocks . I 'd prefer him to not even make it out of the locker room . We 're installing a spearhook in the GRX . I don 't need one to beat that punk . A precaution . As the cars take to the field you can feel the anticipation mounting in the audience . Something is different . There 's an electricity in the air . The presence of Speed Racer has completely changed the equation . How are you feeling ? It 's big . That cockpit is the exact same size it was at Thunderhead . Right . I wanna say thank you for what could be the most exciting moment in my whole life . Couldn 't have gotten here without you . - I 'm looking forward to that cold milk . - Me too . Ladies and gentlemen , start your engines ! The final countdown has begun and a stillness has fallen over this stadium as all eyes turn to one car . Ten . This ain 't a race , this is a showdown . Trouble at the start . A misfire traps Speed Racer , causing a collision . Uh-oh . Look out . Ooh , that kid is wily ! I don 't know how he got out of that one . Nice , nice . Speed Racer blows by Katsu Toppledama , charging into the Moguls . He 's taking on all comers . Kelly Kellencoff makes a move , cuts him off ! Ah , big mistake ! - Speed fakes left , jumps right . He slips in behind Gearbox . Here comes over-under . I told you ! I told you ! Speed Racer seems unstoppable , moving up from dead last , nearing the leaders . Go , Speed , go ! But look out . As they approach the Big Drop , here comes Speed Racer . Speed Racer is knocking on the door of Cannonball Taylor . " Yoo-hoo , anybody home ? " Okay , Mr. Two-Time-Grand-Prix - Five-Time-WRL-Future-Hall-of-Fame teach me something . You ready ? - Ha-ha . - Let 's go . Get that weak shit off my track . Come on , that move is weak . Cannonball Taylor 's in trouble . Tear him up , kid , tear him up . Come on , is that all you got ? Lesson 's over . See you at the finish line . Do it . Stop him . Stop him now . - Oh , no . - What is it ? Spearhook ! He 's got me . Cannonball has Speed pinned as they grind through the butterfly turn . That cheater . He 's using a spearhook ! Cannonball clearly using a spearhook . That could cost him the hall of fame . Not to mention what it 'll do to Royalton Industries . Shame on them . Oh , no , no , no , don 't do this ! - The Triple Phase Conductor 's fried . - Sparky , get me back in this race . - What 's wrong ? - The crash must 've dislodged the conductor . Starter 's overloaded . - The nickelhydrate cells are hemorrhaging . - What do I do ? Don 't panic . Just listen , Speed . Just listen to her . - If I could defibrillate the ... - Shh . Sparky . Give me a second . Is there anything he can do ? I ran a patch through the starter to the Convergenator . If he puts the car in fifth gear , he could jump-start it . Will he know that ? Would Sparky ? What do you need ? He 's back in it ! Come on , kid , move it ! He 's gonna do it . I don 't know why I 'm doing it anymore . You don 't climb into a T-180 to be a driver . You do it because you 're driven . Racing has nothing to do with cars or drivers . You ready to put away your toys and grow up ? Are you ready to become a real racecar driver ? Look at the split . He 's shattering the lap record . If you know so much , tell me why I should keep driving . That 's for you to figure out . I just hope when you do that I 'm there to see it . When I watch you do some of the things you do when you just take my breath away . You remember that night ? We sat together , we watched old Ben Burns and Stickleton . That night , something just clicked . Racing hasn 't changed and it never will . It doesn 't matter if racing never changes . What matters is if we let racing change us . When I 'm in a T - 180 , I don 't know , everything just makes sense . No hesitation . Nothing fazes him . No one seems capable of stopping him . He 's on a mission . With a quarter-lap to go , Speed Racer is back . Two cars between him and destiny . Stop him ! Here we go again . Yes ! Speed Racer ! It 's pandemonium . People here have gone completely crazy . In 14 years , we 've never seen anything like this . It 's a whole new world , baby . It 's a whole new world . He did it . - Yes , he did . - This could change everything . It already has . My men are bringing the family down . Do you wanna go with them ? No . Can I ask you a question ? Did you ever think you made a mistake , hiding the truth from them ? If I did it 's a mistake I have to live with . Whoa ! Speed ! Speed ! Thank you , Speed . I love you , sweetie . That was so beautiful . I 'm proud of you , son .

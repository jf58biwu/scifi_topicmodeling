 Previously on Heroes . I must wipe your memory . 9th Wonders ! Can we leave Matt out of this ? If you 're unhappy , I can always arrange for you to return to your former life . Just tell me what I 'm supposed to do . ARTHUR : Stay with Parkman . I came here looking for you , and what did I find ? You 're waiting for me . I mean , that 's gotta mean something , right ? You saved my life once , Elle . Don 't you see ? I owe you . I forgive you . Now you need to forgive yourself . Arthur 's probably figured out by now that there 's a third piece of the formula . It 's a catalyst . Hidden away in the blood of a human host . I think I 'm the catalyst . I see we share a fascination . It seems most of the powers I 've documented took place during the last total annular eclipse . It 's coming . There 's a moment in every war where everything changes . A moment when the road bends . Alliances and battle lines shift , and the rules of engagement are rewritten . Moments like these can change the nature of the battle , and turn the tide for either side . So we do what we can to understand them . To be ready for change , we steady our hearts , curb our fears , muster our forces , and look for signs in the stars . At these moments , these game changes remain a mystery . Destiny 's invisible hand moving pieces on a chessboard . No matter how much we prepare for them , how much we resist the change , anticipate the moment , fight the inevitable outcome , in the end , we 're never truly ready when it strikes . You 're getting pretty good at that . Yeah , well , it 's not as easy as you make it look . You 'll get there , don 't sweat it . Well , I need to get there now . I have to prove myself . To who ? He 's nobody , I 'm not sure you 'd understand . Okay . Then let 's go again . Gabriel , I need you to do something . Find Claire Bennet . Bring her back to me . You think you can do that ? Yes , sir , of course , I can . I 'm going , too . What ? Well , they 're not gonna make it easy for you , getting Claire . You need help , and I was raised to be a Company girl . Hey , wait , I thought you 'd left all that behind you . Yeah , well , it 's all I know . You need help . Let me help you . You okay with this , Dad ? I think the two of you together , it 's a good pairing . Let 's go get the cheerleader . Why is it always me ? You 're the catalyst , Arthur 's formula doesn 't work without you . I have a plan , but we all have to work together to stop him . Okay , so where 's everyone else ? Nathan is going to find the Haitian , Matt Parkman will get Hiro Nakamura , and you , Claire , have the most important part to play . Great ! What 's my assignment ? Your assignment is to keep from getting caught . Just stay out of harm 's way . But I can fight . I can do more , I can be more . Only place you 're going to be is underground , off the grid . No . No way . I am done hiding . We all have to make sacrifices . What are you gonna do , lock me up ? Don 't think it hasn 't crossed my mind , but no . I have another plan . Hi , Claire-bear . It 's too dangerous for you to go there alone . I 'm just going down there to get the Haitian , and I 'm coming right back . The Haitian is there to hunt down a Level 5 escapee , this guy , Baron Samedi , look . Baron ? No , it 's an alias . Voodoo God of Death . This guy 's into some bad stuff , drug trafficking , kidnapping , slavery . I 'm telling you , Nathan , you 're going to need some help . Pete , I 'm not going down there to save the country . Okay , just ... You don 't understand . Then help me out . When I found my abilities , I knew who I was supposed to be . Okay ? But now ... Pete . Just because you don 't have your abilities , it doesn 't mean you don 't have a purpose . It will if you don 't take me with you . Nathan ... All right . Come on . I need the catalyst . You said you would have it by now . You said you were going to cure me ! I 've got people on it , but all our plans might be for nothing . What are you talking about ? I drew that . It 's going to happen . Today . This is Claire Bennet . She can 't die , it 's impossible . That 's my point . It can 't happen , but it 's going to . You 're the scientist . You tell me how . There 's an eclipse today . Yes . When I first noted abilities manifesting , there was an eclipse . A global event . You said it was a coincidence . Well , I thought it was , but ... But what ? What does it mean ? Look , I don 't know ! But I do know if Claire Bennet dies , then the catalyst dies with her . And there 's no hope for me being cured . That explains this . I 'm going to die . Everything 's going to change today . Everything . I don 't understand what Hiro Nakamura has to do with any of this . Angela made our orders very clear . Yeah , the guy 's a spaz . No , he 's a time-traveler . If Arthur Petrelli has us on the ropes , the man is a walking do-over . I know I have Hiro 's number in his dad 's homicide file . Are you nervous about something ? Arthur Petrelli scares me . Oh , you don 't have to be scared about him . Of course I do . He can take away abilities , and I betrayed him . I betrayed you . No , no , you didn 't . I 'm a betrayer . What ? And a liar , and a thief , and ... No . And I 'm selfish . You know , honestly , I don 't understand why you even keep me around . Because you 're one of the good guys now . So you trust me ? Yes . Completely ? Yes , I trust you completely . I know you , Daphne . Yeah , well , no . You say that , but you don 't know me . Not really . We had a life together . In a dream . It was a spirit walk . It wasn 't real . Arthur killed your father , he could kill us all , or worse . I ... I 'm not gonna let anything happen to you . I promise . Please , just help me find Hiro . Come on . How are we gonna do that exactly ? The guy 's a freaking teleporter . Hey , I need your help . You have to fix Hiro . Look . What does it say ? It says you have to fix Hiro . Arthur Petrelli erased his memory . Hiro now thinks he 's 10 years old . Oh , it 's back there . We 're all gonna die . This is Stephen Canfield 's house . You 'll be safe here . Out of harm 's way . Last time we were here , we almost got sucked into a black hole . What makes it so safe now ? Simple setup . Controllable . I know how you like to control things . Okay , I 'll bite . What does that mean ? It means you 'll do whatever it takes to keep the catalyst safe , right ? Hey , I wanna keep you safe , Claire . You . Not some catalyst . Do you understand ? Yeah , I understand . Aren 't you dead ? Yeah . You 'd like that . What 's your game , nemesis ? I 'm not a nemesis anymore . I 'm a good guy now . I can 't help him , I can 't understand him . Well , Arthur really did a number on Hiro . He really thinks he 's 10 . So , get inside his head and fix him . I don 't think I can . He 's thinking in Japanese . But the comic book says that you ... I don 't know what to tell you . This is way beyond me . Hiro is our reset button . Our walking do-over , remember ? I know , but he still can time travel , he can teleport , and he 's still very powerful . I can 't ... I can 't do this , I 'm sorry , I gotta get out of here . What ? What are you talking about ? Daphne . You paused . What ? When I asked you if you trusted me , you paused . No . No , I didn 't . I 'm a speedster . Fractions of seconds feel like hours to me , and you paused . You don 't know me , and you don 't know what I 've been through . What is that supposed to mean ? Daphne , come on . Matt ? Lawrence , Kansas ? Stop reading my mind . What 's in Kansas ? Come on . Just back off ! Your home . Leave me alone ! Yes , sir , it 'll all be taken care of . Who was on the phone ? Arthur . Just updating him on our status . He thinks Claire is with her father . Glasses himself . He 's scary , he 's not going to make this any easier . Actually , he is . I don 't want him to get inside my head so he could kill me , but it 'd work both ways . I know how he thinks . I know where he 'll hide her . I 'm worried about you . All these " Yes , sirs " and checking in like a good little boy . Just trying to be responsible . Oh , sure . Responsible . Where is this damn rental car guy ? Probably calling the police because I told him you were a serial killer and that you kidnapped me . You must be joking . Why the hell would you do that ? Because I 'm trying to help you . Because it was wrong of the Company to hide our abilities . Because we can do whatever we want . We can take whatever we want . Trust me . Come on . We 're going . You 're not going anywhere ! Oh , God . Oh , help , please help . Please . Let go of the girl . Thank you . Oh , God , thank you . Oh , my God , thank you . Sir , please put down the gun . You really don 't understand what 's happening here . She filled me in pretty good . You serial-killing scum of the earth . They 're all trying to make you into something . A boy scout , a monster . Who 's it gonna be , huh ? Who are you really ? Shut up . I should kill you right now , say it was self-defense . I 'll be famous , a bona fide hero . I hate heroes . What does this eclipse mean , and how could it possibly affect us ? The moon controls the ocean 's waves , the sun , our internal timing , but something is happening to me . I 'm changing , I can feel it . And I can 't control it . What 's this for ? Hit me with it . You wanted me to train you ? Let 's do it , right here , right now . This is how you get over your guilt ? Because I 've been just fine without you . Have you ? I caught the puppet guy . Yeah . You got lucky . And you almost got your mother killed . These are serious , dangerous criminals . I know . You 're not acting like it . What am I acting like ? Like a girl who can 't get hurt . Stupid and careless . What do you know ? You 're the one who left , remember ? My absence does not give you license to act like a brat . I have been trying to do something good with my ability . And I 'm trying to keep you safe . I don 't need your help ! Then hit me . I said hit me . The good news is you 've certainly got the strength . The bad news is you 're clumsy , slow and obvious . Thanks . This time , get your body weight into it . That way all the power will be on the end of the board . Okay ? Let 's go again . What is this , Taekwon-Do ? No , it 's baseball . Let 's go again . It 's Tracy . Nathan 's veering off plan . He 's going to find this Haitian guy . That 's smart , using the Haitian against me . We can 't have that . You 're not gonna hurt him ? I 'm learning today there are some things out of my control . What is that supposed to mean ? It 's time for Nathan to see the world for what it really is . Look , I agreed to help you because you said that we could get Nathan into the White House . You need him , Arthur . So do you . I need you to go to Parris Island , use those connections you 've got . I don 't take orders from you . If you want your way into the Oval Office , you 'll do exactly as I say . Parris Island . The Marine training facility ? Every war needs an army . Washington . I guess there 's no rest for the wicked . Obviously not . I need Hiro to help me find Daphne . But she stole the formula , she 's a villain . No , she 's not . She 's just scared . Of what ? I don 't know . I don 't know , but I gotta find out . Oh , God , I told her that I doubted her . I practically packed her bags for her . Look , we need to help Hiro . Get him back to normal , stop Arthur Petrelli ... But it 'll only take a minute . All he has to do is teleport me to Lawrence , Kansas , I grab Daphne , and ... Lawrence , Kansas ? Lawrence , Kansas . Yes ! That 's us . We 're in a cornfield . She told me that she grew up on a corn farm . Corn farm . Yeah . Lawrence , Kansas . Holy crap , it worked . This is it , this is Daphne 's house . I can hear her thoughts , she 's in there . Holy crap ! Pete . Pete . You all right ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm okay . You ? I 'm good . What happened ? I don 't know . I was flying and then I wasn 't . I was falling really fast . And now ? Nothing . I can 't fly . Hey , wasn 't there an eclipse that first day you flew ? Yeah , so ? So you don 't find that significant ? The guy we 're looking for , the Haitian , he takes powers away . Maybe he saw us coming . I don 't know . Maybe it 's this whole damn country . We gotta find him . Come on , let 's make tracks . All right . Got a long walk ahead of us . What the hell are these , voodoo dolls ? No , they 're called pwen . They 're messengers . Prayers for salvation , redemption . Let 's go . Looking at the map , the Haitian 's village is this way . I saw it from two clicks up . We were falling . Yeah . It 's still this way . Hey , are you ... Don 't you want ... Something I can do for you ? Hi , yeah . I 'm a friend of Daphne 's , can I talk to her for a second ? Daphne 's not here . Daphne ! I know you 're inside , come on . I just need a minute . Go away , Matt . Like I said , she 's not home . Yeah . Why don 't you just let me inside ? Are you threatening me ? I said let me in . Why are you turning your head sideways ? What 's your problem , son ? Psst . What happened ? My powers are gone . His also . What 's going on ? Are you gonna tell me who that was ? Nope . I 'm not asking a lot of questions here . And I appreciate that . But you 've been gone a long time . It 's my home . Can 't I just come home ? Are you feeling okay ? No . It 's happening again . Sweetheart , I 'm sorry . Do you still have them ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'll go get them . All right . All right . If we double back , we should be able to make it to the village in an hour . You 're not even going to admit you were wrong ? You really want to get into this now ? Come on . You gotta stop treating me like your idiot kid brother . You read the map right . Congratulations . God , I wish I could fly . But you can 't . That 's right , I 'm powerless just like you . Hey , if it wasn 't for me , you 'd be lost and alone . If it wasn 't for you , I 'd be home by now . I only brought you down here to protect your fragile ego . You know what ? I don 't need your pity . No , but you know what you do need ? My help . I 've been saving your ass my entire life . Is that so ? That 's right . When you jumped off that roof like a moron , who caught you ? Who pulled you out of Kirby Plaza when you were about to blow up ? You want my respect ? You want my approval ? Earn it . Why would I want your respect ? You 're a puppet . Excuse me ? You have no spine . I 'm a US senator . No . You 're a nurse . You 're everything that Dad ever wanted you to be . His dreams . His goals . He would always find a way to get under your skin and manipulate you , use you . Where 's this coming from ? In the future , you choose him . You choose Dad , Nathan . I 'm down here right now , Pete , and I 'm trying to stop him . You wanna help me ? Good ! Control first , follow-through second . You feel that power ? Again . Tell me what you 're thinking . No . Tap into that anger . It will give you strength . Here , take a swing at me now . I don 't want to swing at you . Come on . Swing at me . See if you can hit me . Let 's go . Come on . You 're not even trying , Claire . Tell me what you 're thinking . Every time you would come home from a trip , I 'd always hug you as tight as I could . 'Cause I thought if I held you tight enough , you wouldn 't leave me again . Why did you always leave ? I need to get some air . Claire , wait a minute , let 's talk about this . No , I didn 't mean to bring it up . Just forget it . Hey , girls . You have the Haitian in here ? No . Just me . Back out of the house now . You 're not getting Claire . Funny story . We are . Claire , stay back . No ! Claire ! Sandra ! Oh , my God ! What happened ? She got shot . Okay . Why isn 't she healing ? I don 't know . Something 's wrong . Her ability 's not working . We have to get her to a hospital . No . They report gunshot wounds to the police . They 'll ask questions . She is bleeding . She is hurt . I 'm calling 911 . And what happens when her healing comes back ? Noah . This is a surface wound . We can deal with it . Hang up the phone . Please . I 'll get the first-aid kit . Thank you . What happened ? I don 't know . I wish I did . Maybe you were right . I have been stupid . Careless . I thought I was invulnerable . Well , you shouldn 't have ... It hurts . I never thought I 'd be able to hurt again . It sucks , but it 's wonderful . Thank you for saving my life . Any time . Still no powers . Yeah . That much I get . Why is this happening ? How do we get it back ? Maybe Daphne was right . Maybe Arthur took them away . You know , I never , ever thought that I would miss my ... Right now , all I wanna do is just know what 's going on inside her head . What are we supposed to do ? He says you must save Daphne . I can 't . I can 't . Not without my brain thingy . What ? He says , this is part of the Hero 's Quest . Hey ! Hey ! Seriously , dude , stop it . Hey ! Hiro ! How do you say " stop it " ? You must not doubt . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I 'm gonna save Daphne . Holy crap . It 's a miracle . Complete remission . All effects of the formula have disappeared . Scales . Abilities . I have no idea how or why . Some correlation to the eclipse . Further study is warranted . But not yet . You 're not going anywhere . Now we know the meaning of the eclipse . Everyone 's abilities have gone away . You have to get them back . I 'm not sure that 's entirely possible . I mean , who knows what the implications of this event are ? They could be irreversible . That 's unacceptable . What are you doing ? Without abilities , I 'm nobody . I already been nobody . You understand ? So we 're gonna stay right here until you get it all back for us . Excuse me . Yeah , I 'll be with you in a second . Don 't worry . We got plenty of Red Hulks for everybody . Sam . Yeah ? Dude , this is so awesome . Is he always this quiet ? I don 't know . Why don 't you ask him ? Listen , I really appreciate your help , but we need to get you back home . My father 's alive . Arthur 's alive ? Yeah . You 're one of the only people who can stop him . Now , the sooner you take this juju off of me , the sooner I can fly us home and deal with him . I 'm not responsible for your condition . My ability is gone as well . The universe has decided our fate . Can the universe get me a phone ? I can call the military . Get us on a C-130 . Get this sorted . I 'm not going anywhere until I stop Samedi . Big guy from Level 5 . I 'm responsible for his evil . He 's my brother . He 's like us . Special . His skin is impenetrable . Not by knife . Not by fire . Not by bullet . Many people here believe him to be a god . He uses fear to form an army . They murdered . Stole . Kidnapped . I stopped him once , put him away , but now ... You can 't do this on your own . Peter , this is not your fight . Come on , you helped our family out once . At least let us repay that favor . Hey , look . All right , you 've proved you can be brave , okay ? Don 't be stupid . Think about it , Nate . The only way to get this guy to come back home with us is if we help him stop his brother . Look , if you 're not gonna do this for the right reasons , at least do it for the selfish ones . Samedi ! Run ! Move out ! Run ! Run ! We know all about you , Senator Nathan Petrelli . Your father warned us you 'd come . My father ? Yes . What did he tell you ? He told me to be myself . No fever . Are you feeling okay ? Yeah . Pretty good , all things considered . We 're gonna figure out what 's happening to you . But for now , you just rest . I 'll be right downstairs . I love you , Dad . And I love you , Claire-bear . No . No what ? You 're leaving , aren 't you ? Do not leave your daughter . Not now . She 's fine . She 's scared . She doesn 't know what 's happening . She needs you . There 's something I need to finish . Daphne ? Daphne , I 'm not leaving until I talk to you . Go away , Matt . No . No . I came here because I know exactly who you are . You are smart and beautiful and funny . I don 't even care if the spirit walk is all a bunk . I 'm not gonna ... I 'm never gonna give up because ... Because I 'm in love with you . Daphne ! The door is open . Daph ? I 'm in here . I just didn 't want you to see me like this . Like what ? Like this . How you doing , sweetie ? Claire ? Oh , my God ! Oh , God , Claire ! God ! It hurts ! Well , it 's gonna hurt forever if I can 't set it . Quit being such a baby . Oh , God . Thanks . Yeah . What 's happening to us ? I have no idea . I used to understand everything , but nothing makes sense . We 're just human . You okay with that ? It 's actually a relief . I felt the hunger , the need to have power was so numbing . My mind felt like it was full of cotton and ice and I haven 't felt like this since I first met you . I pushed you to become that monster . It 's my fault . No . You were just following orders . A Company girl . Exactly . We 're both so ... What , powerless ? We can 't take what we want anymore . Says who ?

Oh , um , Al . Pleased to meet you , Samantha . You 're not dad , are you ? No way ! No , we met on the road . Right , it 's great to have you here . I 'm not sure how much Abby 's told you , but there 's really only one rule here . You reap what you sow . Lots of rewards , security , food , water ; hot water , alcohol ... sweets , games . X-Box ? Playstation ? yes , rewards and work to earn them . Absolutely . Janine , would you show our new friends around ? And then Gavin will assign you to a task-group . And I 'll see you later . Thank you , Ma 'am . No need for that . Abby , um , told me what you did to the thief . That , um ... must have taken a lot of courage . I 'm Tom . How you doing ? Where are you from ? Salford . Yeah ? 15 Hopper Street . Do you want the postcode ? Come on , move it ! Spread out ! Spread out ! Aargh ! Ha , ha , ha ! I got him , I got him . Come on , he 's wounded . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? So sorry . I won 't be with you long . You can 't just ... Drive ! Wheels , wheels , wheels ! Come on , get him ! Open this door now ! Great , keep going . That 's it , keep going . We 're clear . The tyre 's burst , the windscreen 's ... WE are not clear ... We are not , " we ! " I 'm sorry . And it 's not funny ! You 're quite right . Why were they chasing you ? Turn here . Anywhere down this track . It should be OK here . Jimmy Garland . Thanks for saving my life . Why were they chasing you ? I 'll explain that . Let 's change your wheel quickly , so you can get away . Now they 'll be cross with you too . Oh , great , shredded ! OK , right , we need to find you another vehicle which given the windscreen 's probably a good idea . You 're hurt . It 's just a scratch . There are cars a few miles off . I can take you . No , you can 't . All right . Right now , I 'll ... I 'll dress this first . If you don 't mind , perhaps you could come to my place ... for a moment . I 'm not trying to pick you up . Well , that 's a relief . Only me . Who did you think it was ? No-one . Taxis can never find it . Wow . I 'll make some tea in a sec ... .. just fix my puncture . What can I do ? Er ... shine a light ? Oh ! I found this cave with my cousin ... when we were nine . We used to sleep here . So , you live ... lived nearby ? He did , yeah . We 're on the Estate now . My family was in London . They used to come and stay every summer . God , it was so sudden , wasn 't it ? London was bad , so I came out here . They were all dead ... my cousins , my aunt and uncle ... and the house was ... occupied . By the kids who attacked us ? Yeah . I did ask them to leave . They declined . So I retreated ... to sit out the invasion . As the last of the family it 's my job , for better or worse , to maintain the place . Waterhouse ? Yeah . What ? Are ... ? I knew I was nearby . I must have missed the turning . The house ? Yeah , it was just before you ran into me . Is there a 12-year-old boy there ? His name 's Peter ? I , I don 't know . It could be . Your son ? He was on a school field trip and he left the centre . I can 't tell . I need to go to the house . Of course you do . I 'm sorry ... now you 've helped me , you won 't be welcome . Yes , I will ... if I 'm his mother . I 'll get you close . A vantage point . Use the binoculars , see if it 's him . Ow ! Are you OK ? Sorry , it 's just a bit sore . Look , you can 't go anywhere now . Be all right in a minute . Ah , there 's some , there 's tea on the shelf and milk and honey ... The promised land . How 's it going ? Good . Good to work . Simple pleasures . Bloody hell . Time to stop soon . Time to stop now , love . Come on ... Come on , pal . On your feet . That 's the spirit . Maybe it 's Abby . How are you doing ? Do I look like a leper ? So is it just the pair of you ? No . There are four others , three men . Oh . Where are they ? Foraging . Foraging ? What 's that ? Looking for stuff . Oh , that 's what we 're doing . Ha , ha , ha ! Yeah , we 're foraging . We have nothing . Except the clothes on your back ? Hey ! That 's our house , you can 't just walk in . No ? We 've brought a bottle . Now can we come in ? No ! Fair enough . Another time . Leave you to it . Maybe they were OK . Night . Oh , great ( ! ) A dorm . I 'll get nightmares . Al . It 's all right for you . You 've didn 't go to boarding school , did you ? Al ? Stop complaining . You tell him , kid . Tom ? Are you sleeping here ? Blokes only allowed in here , baby . I 've got a room to myself . Great effort , everyone . What did you do before ? No , that 's what HE did ! Cars , casinos , girls ... All paid for by his rich dad . I worked in my parents ' shop . Good for you . Thanks , Naj . Impressive . All right for some . Well , you know , we all can 't be politicians , can we ? Serving the people . Tom , can I have word ? Of course . Night , all . Hey , er ... hey , Sam ? You ever get YOUR hands dirty ? Oh , yes . It 's funny you arriving with Al ... .. such opposites . I 'll take that as a compliment . And if he were to leave ? How would you feel about that ? No problem . Sometimes I feel like leaving . Just ... walking away . Well , you shouldn 't . We need you ... And if , if YOU need anything then , just ask . Thanks . Yes ? Can I have a word ? No rest for the wicked . Mm-hm ! Thank you . Good night . # It will not be long , love # Till our wedding day . # Morning . Morning . I 'm so sorry I 've delayed you . You must be desperate to get to the house . Let 's go . Morning . We like to have a few moments silence at the beginning of the day . Great . Before we eat . How was I supposed to know ? By getting up when you 're asked to . By being down on time . I 'm not a kid . # Bring me my bow of burning gold # # Bring me my arrow of desire ... # That 's enough ! # Bring me my spear ... # Shut up ! I 'm going to have to ask you to leave . How do people feel ? Who here , would like Al to stay ? Me ! Motion carried . You finished , Naj ? We 'd like Najid to stay . Impossible . He sticks with me . I don 't think you 're a suitable guardian . It 's in Najid 's best interests to remain here , in a secure environment . How can best put this to you ? I do not recognise your authority . You got that ? OK , mate , time to go . You 're safe here , OK ? Yeah , but Al 's all right . You have to give him a chance . It 's all right , Naj . I 'd rather be on my own . Great , I 'll help you get your stuff . I got it . I 'll give you a hand . See you out of here safely . Thank you , Tom . No problem . Enjoy . We had to be a bit strict with him , Naj , because I think he thought he was a bit better than the rest of us , didn 't he ? Whereas you , and everyone else here , are willing to work , to learn , to contribute to the community , to the future , of this ... our battered , but unbeaten human race . We 're a team , OK ? OK . Pete ! Oi , Peter , come down here . Peter ... No , Abby ! Hey , stop her ! Get her ! Stop her ! Get her ! I 've got her . The nutter 's fairy godmother ! Hidden weapon ? No ! I 've come for Peter . He 's my son . Really ? OK , just a sec . Let 's go inside . Have a seat . Where is he ? He 's upstairs . You screwed us up yesterday rescuing your friend . Show us his hideout and you can see your son . I would if I could but I , I can 't , I can 't . He blindfolded me . I want to see her . Will wants you to stay here , it might not be her . OK . OK . MUM ! MUM ! Let me see him . Lead us to your friend . Mum ! Please ! Mum ! Peter ! You 're not my mum . I 'm sorry , I 'm so sorry ... Don 't touch me ! I 'll leave you in peace . No , no you won 't . Come on , she 's been through a lot . We should let her go . That 's your plan ? Interesting . Listen , I 'm sorry about your car . Hey ! He 's freaking us out so much . We went , you know , just a bit mental . Hey , this is war . Yeah , but it 's not her fault . How bad 's his injury ? He 's fine . He 's fighting fit . We just want him to stop hassling us . Then leave . We had trouble , out there . It 's not safe . You know what ? He could make you safer . I mean , he knows the land ... He can teach you how to live off of it . So you never have to leave . Look ... maybe I can persuade him , you know , to talk to you . Before somebody really gets hurt . That 's it ... 20 miles . I 've wasted enough fuel . Thanks for the ride . Hey . Sleep well ? Yeah . You ? Dreamt about my mother . Yeah ? Hmm . She was a teacher . What did she teach ? Chemistry . We were shopping for clothes . I was 12 , and we were agreeing , so I know I was dreaming . It 's hard to defend ourselves here with only the two of us . And no weapons . Maybe we should go . Just give her one more day . Are you all right ? I 'm fine . Good , good , good . Wrong boy . I 'm sorry . This does not mean your son is dead . OK ? Come on . That was delicious . Should 've been here a couple of days ago . I got a trout from the river . Where 'd you find the courgettes ? Erm , garden in the village . You stole them ? What if the owner 's heir had turned up and caught you ? I would 've apologised , relinquished them and left him in peace . They didn 't interrogate you ? I told them you blindfolded me on the way to your hideout . Wish I 'd thought of that . Want another hit ? I 'm OK . You know what they need ? They need the right adult . They need someone who 's stronger and braver and cleverer than them . This isn 't their idea . No , no , they 're open to negotiate . They want to stop fighting . They 've had enough ? They won 't leave . But maybe that 's a good thing . You need people to work the land with you . You know to run the place , to defend it and you 're injured . You know , if they chased you again , could you get away ? Just ... just talk to them . I 'll think about it . I 'd like to take you somewhere . My favourite place . What we having ? We came back cos we like you . Lenny really likes you . You go first , Len . I 'll join you . Could be the fan belt ? Nice walk , across the fields . Anya ! Anya ! Anya ? Argh ... ! Anya . Are you OK ? Where 's the other one ? Upstairs . Come on ... You fancy me ? She can 't smell it ... but I can . Yeah ? What ? Prison . You and me in the past , we 'd never have stood side by side . But we can now . Now we need to . Out . Come on ! Why are we alive ? Got an easier one ? ( I just needed to ask you . ) ( Do you want to be here ? ) ( Come on , then . ) ( Live and let live . ) Come on ! This way . Come on . Down here . You 're good . Could 've been a pro . Gone . Good luck to them . Did that yourself ? Yeah , in the Army , years ago . Right . Come and have a drink . What did you do ? How do you mean ? What was your crime ? Gavin ... The guy 's just looking for trouble . Typical police . So you 're familiar with the police ? When I was a kid , yeah . He sees my potential and he 's threatened . Yeah . He 's jealous of what we can do here , that he can 't . You and me . I thought that too ... until I saw your prison tattoo . I worked for a year with ex-offenders . So what did you do ? What I did is done . It 's the past . I thought you were looking to the future . I thought you wanted to give everybody a chance . Be all they can be . How gullible do you think I am ? I don 't think you 're gullible at all . Presenting yourself as dependable , attractive . You give me a chance and I 'll prove myself . You should 've come clean about your criminal record . I think you 'll be better off elsewhere . Your loss . Morning . Ssh ... You want to know what I did ? I thought I 'd come and show you before I go . No ... No , you don 't want me to leave ? Or no , you don 't want me to kill you ? OK . Let 's go back to our place . Negotiation time ? At the house . Oh , yeah . Are you ready ? I meant to ask , what does that mean ? " May there never be an end . " Schoolboy Latin , carved it when I was 12 . " May there never be an end ? " To the summer . To our adventures here . You know that stuff 's been damaged . Disrespected . Saw you coming . Guys ... Listen , sorry I 've been scaring you . Time to talk , yeah ? Absolutely . Come on in . You should sack your cleaner . What are you doing ! We need to make sure he 's not armed ! Look , we came to talk ! Search him . You see ? Concealed weapon . He wasn 't going to use it . He can 't fight all five of you . He can 't now . Snared . I trusted you ! She was tricking us , bringing him here armed . She 's on his side ! You know what ? You guys are good . Yeah , now I 'm impressed . You 've taken me out . You 've won the game . It 's not a game . Agreed . Will ! So come on , then . Huh ? Cut my throat . Jimmy ! Jimmy , stop ! Give me my knife . Give me my knife ! No ! Peter . Mum ! Peter . No ... No ... Cushion . I want a pan of water to sterilise . One of you , upstairs , bathroom , cupboard , top shelf , blue tin , bring it down ! The blade hit his collarbone . Bottom of that bureau , my aunt keeps her sewing stuff . I need needles , thread . Hey . Hey . No-one dies today . Now go get me a blanket ? They 're clearing up . You could stay . The wrong boy . Yeah . We 'll find you a car . He 's sleeping ? Is that good ? Yeah . Does it drive OK ? Yeah , tank 's half full . Good man . Thanks . Be good ! " May there never be an end . " Come on , boys . We 've got work to do . Greg ? Anya ? Naj ? ! Hello ? It 's our car . Over here . They 've come to take you back . We 've left . We didn 't like the way they treated you . The way they treated me ? You 're right . You 're 100 % right to be pissed off . I was out of order , mate , and I got it wrong . Won 't happen again . I 'm sorry . Are you going back to Greg and Anya ? And the chickens . Come on . Let 's go together . Abby ? Hey ... Oh , am I glad to see you . Abby ! It wasn 't Peter . A wild goose chase . You gonna open the flipping door , or what ? Hello . Hi , guys . Come on in . Hi ! Hello . Welcome home . How are ya ? I missed you . I 'm starving . So good to see you . I never thought I 'd be pleased to see you guys again . You want to hide God from me again ! There 's nothing for you here . Do you understand ? I got the virus , I wasn 't immune . You 're fully dilated , the baby 's ready , we 're going to be fine . That 's it . So you just do it for all the people that you loved . Does it matter who we sleep with , Tom ?

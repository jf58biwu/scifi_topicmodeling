You know , the first time we talked , You were sitting by yourself in the grass . That was space too . So it was . You know I used to watch you at school ? When the bell would ring And those narrow hallways would fill up , It got so loud , and people would bump into you . You looked like you could just Jump out the window and run away . God , you 're such a little stalker . All right , so I get that ... We ran away to get some space . The only shame is ... We ran all this way , and there 's skulls everywhere .

God rest his soul . You 're with the american fbi ? Yes , that 's right . You have a boy in your custody . His arrest report lists an alias of john connor , Which matches a fugitive of mine . The domestic terrorism case . You 're familiar with the connors ? It was flagged during processing . But we dismissed it as a coincidence . Your fugitive would be 24 years old by now , If he was not already dead . Look , I 'd be grateful for just a visual identification To help bring me some closure . You have traveled an awful long way for closure . If he is who I think he is , Then I have reason to believe that your prison is in danger . And yes , I 've come a long way .

It 's a clear shot all the way of the alley Back to the jail . No , that 's where it will be waiting . Let me do that . I need to be able to use it . I should hope so . Why are you here ? John was flagged in the fbi computer . Couldn 't you just have buried it ? It 's been watching me . It ? Out there . It . And you still came to mexico ? You could have led it right to john . It wasn 't me in the trunk . So what were you going to do , Just pop him out of jail ? Set him free , no questions asked ? Yes , actually . That 's exactly what I was going to do . Hm , I have a hard time believing that . I owed you one . The fire. silberman 's cabin ? Wasn 't much . It was my life . How you feel about that now ? You have to go . I promise I 'll call you as soon as we get back to l.a. But you have to go . John. riley , don 't . Go home . I swear I 'll explain everything when we get there . Go out the back .

His name 's gonna be on an alert . He 's got other names . Then what ? There is no " then what . " Pretend I died again . I lost a lot when you died the first time . My marriage , my career . That 's a lot to you ? I suppose many people lost those things . You want answers . I just want to know my role In all of this . What happens after this ? This is it . There 's nothing else behind the curtain . This is what I do. it 's all I do . You already know why I do it . I 'm sorry for what you lost . But I can 't help you get any of it back .

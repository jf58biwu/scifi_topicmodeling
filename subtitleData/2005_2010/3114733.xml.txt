 My name is Detective Brett Hopper . And this is the day that changes everything . Put your hands up ! You 're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza I will be framed for murder . Who the hell are you people ? My girlfriend Rita will be in danger . I know all this because I 'm living the same day over and over again . The day is the same , but different things happen . Every day , I get another chance . For every decision , there 's a consequence . Somehow this old murder case is the key . Turns out my sister Jennifer had the missing piece of evidence . Autopsy report . - When she died , she was pregnant . - Isn 't this Dad 's handwriting ? Who 's Tobias Booth ? I don 't know why Garza 's widow was telling lies about me . Brett Hopper couldn 't have killed your husband , he was with me all night . I saw his face . But I think I finally know who 's pulling the strings . As Alberto Garza used to say , hope is bigger than anyone of us . You cannot kill hope ... with a bullet . Now , I need to find out why . sync : FRM @ ะกะก Someone should call Mrs. Garza at the club , tell her she can go home if she wants . I 'm taking she wanna be anywhere but here . How are we coming on the arrest warrant for Hopper ? Just signed out based on Mrs. Garza ID . As soon as we get the paper work , we can knock on Hopper 's door . Nothing worse than a cop going wrong . Makes us all look bad . Easy , Tiger , we 'll get him . Should have it open any minute . You think Garza had any secrets ? Everyone 's got secret . Morning ! Brett , your phone . It 's Jennifer . Do you want me to get it ? Thanks . Is everything OK ? They threatened me . That 's how they hurt Randall , the kids ... I know they were after Dad 's briefcase . There 's a document hidden inside the lining . A document ? How could you possibly know that ? Because these same men are after me . They 're trying to frame me for murder . Murder ? - You have to tell someone . - Listen . We are gonna handle this . We 're gonna take care of it ourselves . I 'm gonna help you . You gotta call this number . Take the briefcase to them . Ask for Fencik or Buchalter . - Alright , you got those names ? - Who are these people ? They 're ex-cops , they 're just muscle now , - I 've been tracing them . - It doesn 't make any sense . Alright , listen , just pair with me . You got that photo ? Who is she ? This is Isabella Contreras . Somehow , everything was back to her being murdered and them trying to cover it up . Do you know who killed her ? Not yet . But I know who has my vote . Thank you . This hope center was the dream of Alberto Garza . A great believer in the people of the city ... So here 's the guy in the monkey suit . Tobias Booth . City councilman . Friend of the common man , pillar of the community . Why doesn 't it sound like compliments ? Because he 's a liar , a thug and a killer . ... city of Los Angeles , Alberto tirelessly paid ... Burn it all down . The cop who lost the book , the gang leader , the girl , kill them all . ... but in distant memory , I 'd like to ... Is he behind the whole Garza thing they 're trying to pin on you ? There might be a bigger fish , but so far , yeah , all my evidence leads to Booth . Have you ever heard the Santayana Club ? Yeah , bunch of rich old white guys , try to act like rich old and white . Yeah , back in 91 , they got this girl who who worked there pregnant , Isabella Contreras . When Booth found out about the baby , he had Isabella killed . Everything that 's going down today goes back to that murder . But why now ? I mean , why after all this time ? I have to work it to find out . ... by the sound of the gun fire . This is definitely better than a day in I.A. Not now ! - Got Andrea Battle in five minutes . - No , you don 't . - She just cancelled . - What ? You don 't cancel I.A. Let me talk to her . She ... left a message . Was she looking a work security in Loserville ? I 'll just get her on the phone for you . I 've got a better idea . Go over Chinatown , see her snitch Danny Yan . If Danny Yan 's connected , he 's not gonna talk . I 'm closing this case today , with or without Battle . Thank you . And now , as proof of our resounding yes , let me introduce one of the greatest success stories of our entire gang initiative : Lewis Torrez joined the Latin Disciples at the age of fourteen . Today , Lewis is a member of my staff and a ... I wonder what he really does for Booth . Why don 't you ask him ? I haven 't been able to get close enough to him . Besides , Booth isn 't the type of guy you wanna go toe to toe with . You told me he 's untouchable . How are gonna get to him ? You cannot kill hope with a bullet . I just did . What did you do ? Scared him . Get Mrs. Garza . Scared people make mistakes . Yeah , we 're gonna be right there when he makes his . You saw your brother this morning ? You 've already decided he did it . Haven 't you ? Anything he sent to you can help us exonerate him . My father was a cop . Drop the act . OK , why did your brother kill Alberto Garza ? He didn 't . He 's being framed by the same men who are after me . It 's the truth . About a week ago , two men approached me . They said they wanted some of my father 's old things and if I didn 't give it to them , they were gonna kill my husband and my children . Why didn 't you go to the police ? Do you have kids ? I will do whatever I have to do to keep my family safe and these men made it very clear what I could and couldn 't do . Any idea why you 're set ? Because Brett is helping me . Because he tracked them . He found out their names : Fencik and Buchalter . They 're ex-cops and the same men who are framing him . A mess of conspiracy , how convenient . Why don 't you call them yourself ? We should look into these guys . Don 't tell me you believe her . We got a positive ID from Mrs. Garza ! - It 's just a phone call . - She 's Hopper 's sister ! She tell us anything to get him off the hook ! She wants him off the hook ! Fine . And if you see any little green men , tell ' em I said hi . - Now I see why Booth 's here . - That 's the grieving widow ? Don 't let the costume fool you , she 's in on it . Please ! Step back . Excuse me ... Catch that photo op . Protecting her the time I need . You can 't elaborate ... Who are you calling ? Someone who might know Booth 's gang banger friend . Where you at , Hop ? Been trying to reach you since last night ! I know about last night , I 'll get to the skinheads in a minute . Skinheads ? How do you know about the skinheads ? I just know , OK ? I promise you I 'll take care of it . Listen to me . I need some information on a Latin Disciple , an ex-gang banger named Torrez . - This ain 't about what you need ! - Come on , Damien ! - Help me ! - Sorry , Hop ' . I 've got an empire to build . - Problem with your CI ? - Yeah ... I 'll deal with him later . We need to get in that house . Here 's a plan . Marching to the crime team with public enemy number 1 ? Could you handle that ? I forgot how much fun it was being your partner . We 're closed . Detective Choi , Robbery / Homicide . Looking for the owner . - His name is Fenshik . - That 's Fencik . - He ain 't in . - You know when he 'll be back ? No . OK . If you see him ... That 's supposed to make yourself more American ? Tell Mr. Fencik he needs to get in touch with me today . I have some questions I 'd like to ask him . There 're pictures of you and Andrea Battle all over Chinatown . Photos of her giving you pay offs . We know that 's not CI money , so ? You 're selling some drugs , or what ? You got it all wrong , Officer . Sergent . Sarge ... I 'm just a small time entrepeneur ... friend of the force . Yeah , small time . Clubs are major cover for drugs and prostitution . We know you answer to the Kwai Long syndicate . That sounds to me like you 've been watching too many Bruce Lee movies . You know what I think ? I think this is not about me at all . I think this is a beef between you and ... Charlie 's Angel . But it ain 't my fault she got a junkie boyfriend with bad credit and a soft spot for strays . Do you know where Battle is or not ? I can 't tell you , but if you see her , send her my love . Now if we 're finished here , I got a business to run . You know , they go real nice with a little rice and wasabi . You go to the SPA . Do let me know how things works up with Gar , yeah ? Keep walking around , nothing to see here . What 's in the back ? I 'll meet you , buddy . My pitbull . Oh , yeah ? I love dogs . What 's his name ? Can I pet Baxter ? No men , you know what , he 's sick but you can pet this if you like . That 's really neat . I got one of those myself , except mine came with a really shiny badge . Your safe , here . I thought it was taken care of it . It was . I didn 't know there was anything else . Well , someone else clearly did . Did you ever think to check the safe ? What are you doing in here ? This is an active crime scene , sir . And you two shouldn 't be back here . This is Mrs. Garza . I 'm helping her to gather some things . Right now , you 're tampering with evidence . Now , I 'd ask you to leave . - What 's your name ? - I don 't see how that 's relevant . Your name ... Thank you for your diligence , Detective Battle , I 'll be sure to mention it to your chief . We 're playing golf in the morning . Give him my best . Yeah , it 's cool on tonight schedule . Booth says we gotta move forward . Can 't wait anything the way it was . At the summit . Stand up slowly . Step away from the door . I 'm a cop , I 'm gonna show you my badge . Alright ? Did you notice that this door was open ? - No , sir . - Why not ? Did you check for signs of forced entry ? I got this ID over here right away . Why don 't you do that ? You 're a dead man . You can 't make me go away as easy as Isabella Contreras . And before this day is done everyone 's gonna know the truth about you . Help ! Over here ! I need help ! This way ! He 's running this way ! There ! That Hopper ! He killed Garza . Go back to garage , now . No more screw-ups . Who is that ? Yeah , thanks for coming back to me , Mr. Fencik . Sure , when do you want to meet ? Where 's that ? OK , I 'll see you there . What 's up ? Torrez . What 's up ? You 're here , Hop ' ? Tell me , bro . - Damien ! - Why the hell are you whispering ? Listen , I need some info on Lewis Torrez . He 's pretty high up in the pecking order . He kicks it with the city councilman . I could tell you a lot of things . But I got problems on my own . I got bagged . I need you to call them and tell them I 'm your CI . Get me out of here ! What happened ? I was over in Chinatown and some cop just decided to make photo of me . - What were you doing in Chinatown ? - Well , what I do . Me and my boys went to a gentlemen 's club . Not the One Band . I had a lucky guess that you 'd be following me . I know that Slim runs the street joint for the Kwai Long . and I know the Kwai Long has been in war with the Latin Disciple , so why would you hang with them ? It 's a help-help situation , Hop . You want answers to your questions ? Get me out of here ! I 'll be back after the summit . This is good for all of us , hermanos . See you , man . You Choi ? Mr. Fencik . Thanks for taking the time to meet with me . I just had a couple of questions for you . - What it 's about ? - A homicide investigation . Your name came up . Really ? How ? I 'm just asking . Your name comes up in a murder investigation , you 're not gonna ask how ? I understand . You know a man named Brett Hopper ? I can 't say that I do . Hey , can I get some more peanuts here ? Good service is hard to come by these days . Yeah . - You hang on here regularly ? No . I had some other business here tonight , kinda fell appart at the last minute . But what I do like about this place ... is they don 't really care if we do this . How about those peanuts ? I didn 't want to wake you . I wasn 't sleeping . - I didn 't call you today , did I ? - No . - You didn 't . - I 'm sorry . Somewhat has been happening , I thought you 'd be safe with Chad . But then I didn 't see his car . - Why would Chad 's car ... - Never mind ... I just had a lot of calls to make and I know that you 're pissed . You have every right to be . I just ... I know , baby , I just forgot . And I 'm sorry . But you ... You knew that I 'd do this , right ? I would run and round all day with Andrea trying to prove it . Wait . You had time to tell Andrea you 're wanted for murder ? Yeah , she 's a cop . She can help . But I can 't ? I didn 't say that . Where have you been all day ? I got in a little trouble but ... it 's not what we 're talking about now . Really ? What is we 're talking about right now ? Rita , I 'm ... I 'm sorry . You know , one of the great things about having someone to love , Brett ... Is that you can tell them anything . I can 't believe you just told me that ! I thought I could tell you anything ! Yes , you can . But you can 't say " Hey , by the way " I 'll be falsely accused of murder this morning . See you later honey " . I got nothing . Did you know about these charges last night ? Yes ... No ! It depends on what you mean when you say ' last night ' . Last night last night . Chinese food ... Fooling around . But did you forget about that part too ? No ! Of course not baby ! - Is this Andrea now ? - No . She d ... I 'm gonna tell her right now . Do a better job telling her than you did me . OK . Uh ... Yeah . And now , as proof of our resounding yes , Let me introduce one of the greatest success stories of our anti gang initiative . Lewis Torrez . Can 't stay long . One deliver voice mail for Shelten pushed back the IA meeting But Sgt. Slaughter was at his desk . He found himself at the top of the gang pyramide . He was prosecuted by Alberto Garza 3 years ago and sentenced to prison . So Torrez is a liaison between Booth and a Disciple . I thought he was reformed ? If he 's reformed , I 'm Dick Chenney . Today , police is the key contributed to the community ... Torrez runs guns for the Latin Disciples . He 's going to some summit that 's going down tonight . What 's it about ? I don 't know . I gotta go down to Chinatown to check down my CI Damien . See if he can fill in any blanks . Do you need me to drag Torres down at the station and get a location out of him ? Scary how you read my mind sometimes . Come on . Excuse me . It 's your vehicule sir ? Huh , yeah . - Anything stolen ? - I 'm not sure . You should probably check out thoroughly and report it , it 'll help with the insurance . Thank you . I 'll do that later . - There 's no need to be hostile . - Hostile ? Calm down , sir . I am calm . What 's under the blanket ? Open the door and step aside . Do you know who the hell I am ? I was just up on stage with councilman Booth . And this morning , I had breakfast with Count Chocula . Now open the door , and step aside . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but didn 't councilman Booth say that you did time ? Sure hope this isn 't your third strike . Scuse me , I 'm looking for the detectives in charge of the Garza case . Well , you 're having me . Detective Choi . I 'm Rita Shelten , one of your detectives called me . I 'd like to talk to you about my boyfriend , Brett Hopper . Come with me . This whole thing is a huge mistake . Brett 's being framed . What 's this supposed to mean ? Well , at least you all have your story straight . Look , Hopper 's sister was in here earlier repeating the same thing . OK , first off ... I resent your tone . Brett was with me all night . So basically you 're calling me a liar . I never said that , Ms. Shelten . And second , I don 't think you understand the kind of man Brett is . He lives his job 24 / 7 . He believes in it . That 's the kind of guy who 'd charge into a burning building to save a stranger . You 're after the wrong man . Excuse me . Got something upon the guy the sister mentioned , Fencik . He owns a chop shop in Chasworth . You might wanna check it out . I thought you said this was a waste of time . Probably is , but at least it will look you did the leg work . You 're late . Guys in narcotics , looking for you . Yeah , I know , I 'll be in as soon as I process this guy . We do this now . Come on . Go ahead and get started . I 'll be back to question him in a bit . You 're making a big mistake , mi reina ! Then how come you 're the queen going to jail ? I 've nothing to tell you , perro Do you hear me ? Put the guns down or we 're gonna put you down . Put ' em down ! I 'm coming at a bad time ? Nah , come on in , uh ? And close the damn door . Alright , now on the count of three , we 're all gonna lower our guns . One ... Two ... Three . It was worth a try . What the hell are you doing here ? How do you know this cop ? Oh , me and D , we go a way back . We got the same thing going on as you and my partner , Andrea Battle . You and Battle ... Is that a fact ? Cast no stones , friend . Now that you two are caught up , will somebody please explain me what you 're doing hanging together ? Cause the last time I checked , Kwai Long and LDs didn 't play the same sand box . This little party has anything to do with Torrez 's got going on tonight ? D ? Outside . We 're not done here . - Where did you get in this stuff , Hop ' ? - Come on , D ... I know Torrez is working on some kind of a deal with councilman Booth . And this has nothing to do with any anti-gang initiative . Torrez is a trader man . He 's selling out the soul of the LDs , making deals with baby kissers like Booth . But what 's Torrez getting out of it ? Protection . He gets to move his product uninterrupted . - So he 's out of retirement . - Retired ? He didn 't even take the week-end off , Hop ' . Meanwhile Booth gets the cut of his profits and a nice public victory . Just in time for campaign season . Public victory ? What do you mean , like bust ? You were planning to turn in Torrez at the Feds , uh ? That 's what Baxter wanted to testify about . LD 's supposed to be family , man . See Torrez , he don 't care about how many hermanos get sold out . As long as he gets his house in burbs and a fat corporate expense account . That 's why you 're here , meeting with Slim . So you can put yourself together a little rebel alliance . Take Torrez out , maybe grab yourself a corner office while you 're at it . Spoils of war , Hop ' . Besides , ain 't gonna be no sacrificial lamb for some White politicians . Now , what about this summit Torrez has going on tonight . You wanna think about that ? No , man . Maybe he 's gearing up to make a round at me . No offense , but I doubt he 'd need a crate full of guns for that . What guns ? Hey , Ballanger ! What happened to my collar ? Told you to process the guy , now I hear he 's getting loose . Look , I booked the guy . Then he made a phone call . Next thing I know , they tell me the charges have been dropped . - Who did he call ? - I don 't know . This garage we 're going to ... What kind of heavy metal you see ? Like real heavy . Fully automatic military grade - You sure these were LDs ? - Yeah . Torrez is with them . He had a crate of this stuff , he 's supposed to leave it to the summit that 's going down tonight . This don 't sound like no casual meeting great to me , Hop . Sounds like they 're gearing up for war . War with who ? You waste these fools , I get first digs on the guns though . What happened to the weapons ? You . - Where 's the summit ? - Yeah , right . - Ho , don 't worry , Hop . We speak the same language . Hablas Smith Wesson ? Hey , Andrea , what 's up ? Torrez was let out . Charges were dropped . - Booth for progress . - Yeah , that 's what I thought too but before he was released , he made a phone call , and it wasn 't to Booth , it was to a bar . - A bar ? - Yeah , and it gets better . The place is called The Summit . It 's a biker hangout downtown . - You want the address ? - Yeah . We gotta go . What about these two ? Torrez is gonna hit the skinheads . That explains the fire power . - It should be a blood bath . - I know , we gotta move . We ? Bud , you got a mouse in your pocket ? My own people want me dead . Skinheads do too . That 's what Sun Tzu would call a lose-lose situation . Then what , is that a no ? Consider this as a start . Seven guns per case . Ten cases total . That 's seventy guns on the street . Booth is guaranteeing us protection from Jambo to Tijuana . Cops like this one will be sport . There is nothing that can stand in our way . All we have to do is get along . Get out ! What 's up , fellows ? You shoot , you die . Choi , you OK ? Do I look OK to you ? You be easy Fencik or one of these coming right at you . I gotta say , I thought I was showing up for a rumble in the jungle . But instead , this is one big happy love fest . These guns are for war ? They 're peace offering . A skinhead alliance with the Latin Disciple . All brokered by councilman Booth and his little lapdog . You 're not gonna make it outta here alive . That 's ok . As neither are you . Tell me something , Este . How many of your crew did you have to give up for that hand-tailored suit , uh ? Twenty ? Thirty percent ? And you 're ... calling yourself White Sea Premise . Listen to this Latino promise you a bigger a piece of your own American dream . What makes you think Booth is gonna deliver anyway ? What makes you think one single city councilman has enough power to keep everybody looking the other way ? You have no idea what you 're messing with . Oh , is that right , Buchalter ? Won 't you get your ass over here and help me cut him loose ? I don 't think so . Help me cut him loose ! Or what ? You 'll blow yourself up ? You don 't have the stones for it . Wanna bet ? It 's ringed ! Move ! Everyone freeze ! It 's about time you showed up . Next time , dial faster . So , I called Rita . Chad 's there . So , she 's safe . Thanks , Andrea . For everything . Hopper , I don 't know what this is all about . But I still got to do this . - You 're under arrest for the murder ... - Yeah , I know . That 's my cover . You sure ? You don 't look so good . I got it . And I gotta thank you . You didn 't have to save my ass back there , but you did . And you 'd still be free if you didn 't . Why were you at that bar ? I was following a lead . Lead from who ? From your sister . She mentioned those two guys . The ex-LA sheriffs . Fencik and Buchalter . She said there were framing you . And you believed her ? No , not at first . But then , your girldfriend came in , in a pretty passionate statement vouching for you . She said some things that ... Anyway ... they really want the best for you . It 's nice to know . Look , man . I work homicide , okay ? I don 't know anything about gangs or councilmen or ... or whatever was going on in that bar ... I didn 't killed Garza . I just can 't prove it yet . What would you need ? Mrs. Garza didn 't want to stay in the house . You can probably imagine . Walk me through . Obviously anything important we bagged and tagged . Windows were closed . No signs of forced entry . The body was here . Three bullets . Two to the chest , one to the head . Execution style . Gone through-and-throughs . Coroner pulled three clean slugs , 9 mm . Prints ? Yeah . Garza 's , Mrs. Garza , the clean lady . But not mine ? Not here . Don 't you think it 's a little funky that I would be careful enough not to leave a single print here . But then hide the murder weapon with the prints In my own closet . Where does Mrs. Garza say she saw me ? She said she heard commotion from upstairs . She came of that door away . And you were standing over her husband 's body here , with a gun . So she ran . What about the safe ? We opened it first thing . There wasn 't anything in there , it was cleaned up before LAPD showed up . Whatever Garza kept in here , he got rid of it . You called and left me a message about this package . - He told me to call you . - Who ? When he brought me the packages , they were both sealed . I think I know what was inside . Evidence from one of my father 's old cases . Garza sent it to me . That 's why he was killed . Your dad 's case ? And that 's why you think they 're framing you ? One of the reasons . And this is connected somehow with ... With that bar and the gangs , councilman Booth ? Yes , the councilman is behind Garza 's murder . - So , we bust him ! - No , it won 't be that easy . This doesn 't end with Booth . Look on the bright side . With everything we got tonight , we 're gonna get these guys . And by tomorrow , you 're a free man . I hope so . What ? Somebody messed with this . What are you talking about ? There was a fax here . I saw it this morning before we photoed the room but it 's not on the picture . Someone took it . I will check the machine , see what time the last fax was sent . Last night . That 's my home number . Wait . Garza faxed you last night ? He must have tried . I don 't have a fax at the house . Does this sort of fax has a memory ? Miguel Dominguez . Why would Garza send this to you ? That thing you asked about matched a guy named Miguel Dominguez . That Jane Doe case . Your dad already had a suspect , this Dominguez guy . Trouble was , he was locked up in Pelican Bay at the time . He is the Boogey Man . He 's like Freddy . Kill you in your dreams . He wanted me to find out . oks like I 'm going to Pelican Bay ...

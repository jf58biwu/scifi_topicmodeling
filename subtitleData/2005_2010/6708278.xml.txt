 You 're the most beautiful woman I 've ever seen , but I gotta tell you , I 'm gonna go with someone else . You what ? I 've been doing a lot of thinking and ... I found a better deal . Make love to me , Larry . - Excuse me ? - Make love to me before you walk out of my life forever . Well , I guess we 're consenting adults . Aha ! I accept your rejection . - Can you hear anything ? - No , it 's just a fast busy signal . I 'm gonna wring that I.T. Bastard 's neck . I thought you said all you had to do was ... - right , just turn it on and dial . That 's what they told me , that 's what I did . - Son of a bitch . - Well then , how are you gonna call the limo company ? - How will they ever find us ? - I don 't know . What do I look like ... the dispatcher ? I have no idea . They were supposed to meet us with the sign in by baggage claim , but no . I guess we 're not in Kansas anymore . Not even close . Oh , you know what ? This is horseshit . I 'm not gonna wait around this glorified bus station one more second . We 're taking a taxi . Come on , let 's go . Yes , hello . Uh , do you speak English ? Thank you . Hello , sir . Do you speak English ? Forget it , thank you . Yes , hello . Uh ... do you speak English ? Yes , and the capital of Nebraska is Omaha . - You 're hired , good . Load 'em up . - Ho-ho-ho , this way , John Wayne . I 'd love to take your money , but these cabs are lined up in order . You have to take the one at the head of the stand , or I will be killed , and I 'm not kidding . All right , look ... How much does it cost to get from here to the Rankov in U.S. dollars ? 20 , give or take . For crying out loud . Yes , hello . See this ? It 's money . I 'm giving you money , okay ? Thank you . Have a good day . All right . Look , do me a favor , will you ? Tell him he 's paid in full . Yeah , Hardy har har . Capitalism works every time . Welcome to Bulgaria . Talk about a gypsy cab . If you please , I 'm not gypsy . I 'm Russian . Big-time difference , Roy Rogers . Yeah . Well , if you please , my name isn 't Roy Rogers , - and it 's not John Wayne either . - It 's William Cole . - And I 'm Jackie . - My name is Yegor . Yegor ... pleased to meet you . - What brings you to Bravoda ? - Business . - Shopping . - Plenty of blue-light specials here . Capitalism is still new to us . We 're not as good at ... how you say ... price gouging ? Good morning , p-money . Your teeth are very dirty . Brush them . How are you supposed to get the women with your hair like this rolling in your ' 64 ? Brush your hair . Now you 're looking fly . Pavel . Pavel ! Come . Quickly ! Sleep ! Yes , doctor ? Tell me what you see here . Look . I see cells . Normal cells ? Normal cells . What is big whoopee ? They 're cells from two different DNA profiles . Huh ? Each one ... - Living side by each , growing ? - Yeah . Duplicating ? It appears the new inhibitor is working . That is some phat news ! Slip me some skin , my main man . Oh , come on . Excuse me , there 's no buckle for my seatbelt . What we need seatbelt for ? It 's short drive . Frankly , you don 't seem like a good driver . I 'm excellent driver . Will you slow down , please ? What is problem ? I 'm going with flow of traffic . I 've always loved the smell of European cigarettes . - Would you put that out , please ? - It 's his cab , dear . It 's my lungs . And just so you know , where I come from , a little place called America , the customer is always right . Too bad . You 're here now . Excuse me , will you please not talk on the cell phone while you drive ? - It 's my uncle . - I don 't give a shit if it 's the pope . I 'm not paying you to talk on the cell phone . I 'm paying you to drive the cab ! William , you 're being such an ugly American . Oh , what ? You like it here so much - you wanna move to Bulgaria ? - It 's tempting . Just so you know , in many states in the U.S. it is against the law to talk on a cell phone while you drive . Everything 's against law in U.S. - America is police state . - Yeah , that 's a good one - coming from you commies . - William , - give it a rest . - This idiot is insulting our way of life ! What 's to be happy about capitalism ? Under communism I had good paying job with pension , nice housing , mate . And now with capitalism I drive a taxi , I live small apartment , I work 25 hours a day to have nothing . Capitalism is the only way to go , because from capitalism flows democracy , okay ? So your miserable little life will improve eventually . Whatever you say , Donald trump . What 's going on ? Anybody 's guess . This could be a security check , could be a goat in the road . Isn 't there any other way to get to the hotel ? The only other way is through gypsy town . - I don 't recommend it . - Take it , okay ? ' Cause I 'm not gonna sit here and breathe this smelly exhaust for another second . Come on . Customer is always right . You realize what this means , don 't you ? With this new drug I have discovered , two different brains can be put together like uh ... what 's the word for " interlocking toys " ? - Legos ? - Lincoln logs , huh ? Think of it ... if the body no longer rejects , nothing is impossible . And our timing could not be better . It just so happens that the C.E.O. Of the largest drug company in the world is coming to our fair city . For why ? What does it matter for why , for who , for what ? When he arrives , we will present our case . But tonight , Pavel ... Tonight we celebrate ! Heh ! Uh ... No no , I 'm good . Red bull ... Is it impossible for you to do anything traditional ? What can I say ? I like new things . I am a global citizen . You have no sense of history . Nasdrovye . Down the hatch . Think of the minds that can be saved , repaired or even replaced . Just imagine , how would you like to have the intelligence of Albert Einstein ? The wit of mark twain ? The vision of Leonardo Da Vinci ? I 'd like to have hot water in my apartment . To comrade Alexander , the father of Russian bio-physics , in celebration of the next step . We are finally ready for human trials . This is border . In gypsy town , they have two rules ... number one , stay in car . - What 's the second ? - Same as first . No problem . Good lord , William . This wasn 't such a good idea . This crazy place ... anything can happen in gypsy town . - She an actual gypsy ? - Big time , yes . - Do you know her ? - She 's head case . Lives up ahead with grandparents . Above family bridal shop . What happened to her parents ? Who knows ? It 's gypsy town . That 's depressing . Why do you know so much about her ? How do you say in America , I take the fifth . How much further before we 're out of here ? Not far . Almost out . I was afraid of this . What do they want ? - This car . - Oh my god . Wait wait wait . What are you gonna do with that ? Discourage them . Now what was rule number one ? Stay in the car . Hello , Uri . Shouldn 't you be home playing video games ? Yegor Stragov ! What ? - What should we do ? - I don 't know . You 're the man , aren 't you ? Oh , for god 's sake . I 'm in , I 'm in . Never ask a man to do a woman 's job . When you show disrespect ... be prepared for consequences . Run fast ' cause I 'm gonna shoot you in the ass . I 'm sorry you had to see that . I 'm sorry about a lot of things , Yegor , but that wasn 't one of them . That was exciting . We might wanna keep this guy . He seems to know his way around . For once we agree . Yegor , thank you for a very memorable cab ride . Anytime , Mrs. lady . - Listen , Yaigor ... - Yegor , Yegor . Yeah , whatever . Look , we got off on the wrong foot . You seem like a pretty resourceful guy , and I 've got some meetings I have to get to today . What would take to keep you on call today ? - $ 200 , U.S. ? - I give you 150 . - Cash ? - Of course . - Plus gas , food and cigarettes . - No , I don 't smoke . You have to buy your own damned cigarettes . You got yourself a deal . Our first meeting is in two hours . Now look , my wife ... she doesn 't really know her way around the city , obviously , so ... - After you drop me , can you take her shopping ? - Of course , but there are no Saks five Avenue in Bravoda , you know ? That 's okay . Just someplace nice . Now look , do me a favor , will you ? Keep your eyes peeled for a jewelry store . I gotta get my wife , uh ... - Something special . - Trouble in paradise ? I take the fifth . I 'll find you something . Easy peace . Well , I 'm off to hear their pitch . Have fun . That Yegor guy will pick you up after he drops me . Whatever . You know , every once in a while you could pretend to care . Oh , I pretend , William . I 've been pretending for years . Excuse me . Sorry . Have I seen you before ? No . I think I have . I never forget a beautiful woman . Have a nice day . Taxi ! - Good news , Mr. Cole . - You found something ? This will make your wife very happy . Yeah , that would be a neat trick . Wow , it 's beautiful . - Where did you get it ? - What does it matter ? Well , how do I know it isn 't fake ? Let 's just say I know . Where to ? Central subway station . - There is no subway in Bravoda . - Not yet . It 's another project the commies failed to complete . Let me tell you , mass transportation would transform this city . And put me out of job to be sure . Doctor ! Doctor , doctor , you know what ? You know what ? - Guess what ? - What , Pavel ? - William Cole is in town . - He is ? ! Oh , excellent excellent . - Take a letter . - Okay . Okay . " Dear Billy . " - Too familiar . - Willy ? Mr. Cole ! " Dear Mr. Cole , allow me to introduce myself . My name is Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov . I am a research scientist . I am working on an anti-rejection drug , the same as your company is developing , but I have demonstrated the use of two different D.N.A. Profiles which can act together , side by side . " " Like Lincoln logs . " Strike that . " Side by side , together ... Which will allow perfect organ transplants of all kinds . In fact , I have human example . " " A human exam ... " we do ? Ah , I just want to get his attention . Oh ... " The world is a dangerous place , Mr. Cole . Between war , accident and illness , injured people cover the globe . Who knows if the next person may not be you ? I look forward to meeting with you and to hearing from you as soon as possible . Yours , in the interest of humanity , Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov . " Make sure you get this to him as soon as possible . Yes , doctor . But first I make letter better . The hard part , Mr. Cole , is already done . Easements are pre-existing , routes have been established , and construction is , by our estimates , 65 % complete . Finished plans have been sitting on the shelves for 30 years . All you need now is the money to finish the job . I understand . How do you like Bravoda so far , Mrs. Cole ? Yegor , I couldn 't tell you . When I travel with my husband , mostly what I see is the inside of a jet , the inside of a taxi , the inside of a hotel room . Maybe in Bravoda we change that for you . Sounds good . Let 's start with a cigarette . - I didn 't know Americans smoked . - This one does . When my husband isn 't around . It 's strong ... Like everything in Europe ... coffee , beer ... Men . Egads ... You ever wish you could get a new body and start over again ? I 'm happy with what I have , Mrs. Cole . Well , of course . Just look at you . Who was that woman we saw in gypsy town just today ? Was long time ago . I was with K.G.B. During communism . I was assigned to gypsy town . How you say , I get short straw . I promise not to tell my husband . He 'd freak out . Everyone has to make a living . Long story short , I met Tatoya in gypsy town . What happened ? We were engaged to be married , but I broke it off . She didn 't take news well . Is there a woman in your life now ? No . Why don 't we skip shopping for today , Yegor ? Show me the city . Let 's take the scenic route . Customer is always right . After you recoup your initial investment , we split 50-50 for the life of the project . Bravoda gets a subway system . My drug company gets much needed diversification . Not to mention a hell of a fourth quarter write-off . All very attractive , no ? Yes , it is . I 'll give it some serious consideration . I hate to say this , Alexander , but uh ... My cell phone doesn 't work . Can I borrow yours ? Of course . Here . Thank you . The phone 's ringing . Let it ring . That 's embarrassing . I guess I need a ride to the hotel . It 's the least we can do . Please . Mr. Cole ! Uh ... Uh , hello . - Who are you ? - Please , to read . " Mr. Cole , if you ever wanted more than you have today , if you ever looked at your successful friends and said , ' hey , my friends are successful ... ' " " a really famous research scientist has developed a powerful wonder drug that will change history and he want you to be a part of it . " That 's good . I 'm spending millions of dollars on research , and I 'm supposed to drop everything to visit some quack doctor from bullshit Bulgaria ? No , it 's a win-win situation . Let me be very clear with you ... I am simply not interested in your scam . - Okay ? - Part of your team . No , not interested . Thank you very much . - I can make ... - good day . Jackie ? Sorry , I just finishing . What 's your hurry ... Mysterious woman ? One day , we will be together . I 'm sorry , what did you say ? You and I will be married . Look , maybe this is just a cultural thing , but you and me , we 're just fooling around . I mean , if you think in a million years that I would marry some gypsy freak , - you 've got another thing coming . - As do you . Ahem . I 've heard of maid service , but this is ridiculous . Out ! - What was that all about ? - Well , I came back , you weren 't here , the maid was , I asked her to leave , - and then you showed up . - Just in time , apparently . As if you 're in a position to talk . What the hell were you doing all this time with the commie ? Shopping . But you 'll be pleased to know that I didn 't buy anything . Yeah ? Well , I did . Holy hell ... She took it . It was ... it was a ring that I bought for you ... some cash , my wallet ... that gypsy maid stole it all . Nice try , William . Look , we should stop kidding ourselves . - This hasn 't worked for quite a while . - Wait wait , - where are you going ? - I 'm taking myself to dinner , and when I get back , - you 'd better be in a different room . - What is that supposed to mean ? I 'm leaving you . This time it 's for good . Hey ! What have you done , Tatoya ? How could you give our ring away ? I didn 't . I sold it . Big difference . I loved you , Yegor . You were the most beautiful man I ever saw . I would do anything for you ! I 'd kill for you . If I cannot have you forever ... Can I at least have you ... One last time ? Double crossing ... I 'm sorry to say , Mrs. Cole , the news isn 't good . Because of the severe brain injuries , your husband isn 't able to function on his own that includes breathing , speech , motion , the five senses . We could keep a pulse going , but it 's not much of a life . You and I had something once , William . I 'm sorry you were taken away before I could ... Get that back . Goodbye . All right , doctor , pull the plug . - Gypsy town . - I wouldn 't recommend it . Who is the customer here ? Take me . Okay , lady . This is most fortuitous , Pavel . Because of this tragedy , we will be able to show Mr. Cole the value of my idea . - Bring those bodies to me . I will prepare the lab . - Da . You killed my husband , bitch , and now I 'm gonna kill you . Bitch . I 'm not through with you . You miss your husband . Now you can be with him forever . Prepare the inhibitor . - Vital signs ? - Stable , doctor . Excellent . Now all we can do is wait and see . Blonde woman found in gypsy town ? That 's most unusual . You want for me to pick her up ? In this world you never know what you 're going to get . Yeah , bring her to me . Okey-dokey . Light . Optical response , positive . Smelly . Olfactory response , positive . Auditory response , positive . Match . Sensory response , - positive . - Where am I ? This is a private facility . Allow me to introduce myself . I am Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov . I 'm Pavel . - What happened to me ? - You have suffered a terrible head injury . The right side of your brain was severely damaged . We used donor tissue also from the right side of the cerebrum and combined the two portions . Like Lincoln logs . Who is the donor ? A horrible man ... face like a fish ... it is irrelevant ! Eventually , your brain will overcome the donor portion , and will once again function as a whole . Now let me see you wiggle the fingers of your left hand . Why the left ? If your left side is able to move , it means that the new tissue on the right side of your cerebrum is functioning properly . Yeah , I must say you 're doing extremely well . Well , that 's good because I was ... I just saw an image in my head of ... Something happening to me . This is good . It means that more of your memory is returning . But it wasn 't my memory . I was seeing myself . Ah , well , the hippocampus is experiencing cerebral flushes ... waves of chemicals being released from the other brain tissue . Doc , it happened again . Only it wasn 't my memory . Well , you are suffering from post-shock stress disorder . Do not be alarmed . I think I 'm losing it . Pavel , quickly ! Where are you taking me ? Nothing to worry about . I have to make a few routine adjustments to your temporal lobe , no ? Let go of me ! You must let us do this ! - We are trying to save your life ! - What kind of a life is this ? ! There is no telling how long he will survive . What 's for dinner ? Huh ? Stop staring at me ! Don 't be afraid , comrade . - Who said that ? - I wish I could tell you . - Where are you ? - Where do you think ? Are you doing that ? I have no control over it . Looks like it . I control the right , I guess . From now on , I suggest we stop using " I " or " me . " - It 's we . - Okay ... - What do we do now ? - We need clothes , food and car . Follow me . These cars are going to be sold on black market . This one . - Somehow I know this car . - Are you kidding ? This is a piece of crap . We 'd do a lot better with these . Just take one of these . It 's my body too ! I 'll shut you down . Oh yeah ? Two can play your little game . You got a problem with me ? No ! Stop it ! Hey ! Ah ! All right , all right . We 'll take the taxi if you want it that bad . Don 't forget ... You hurt me , - you hurt yourself . - Okay . Get up . Ah ! Hey hey , where are we going ? Looking for tool . Let me help . - I got it . - It 's a two-handed job , idiot . Ha . You 're welcome . Hey ! Hey ! Fuck , you stole a car I stole , you freak ! Feels strange driving a car . I wasn 't going to say anything , - but you piss-poor driver . - Easy for you . Are you as hungry as I am ? Of course . But we have to earn some money . Aha , there is our clothes . - Hey ! Oh ! Hey ! - Go on . Give me that . Beat it . No way I 'm wearing a tie . Okay okay okay ! Not on your life ! That 's more like it . Time to work , comrade . Wait a minute , we 're not gonna beg , are we ? You 're thinking maybe we worked at McDonald 's ? No . No way , I 'm not a beggar . Never begged for anything in my life , and I 'm not about to start now . Come on . Please to give me some money ? No no . No no no . That 's okay , I 'm fine . - Thank you . - Uh ... Don 't you hear me ! Yeah ... that 's okay , ma 'am . I 'm just fine without it . Thank you very much . We will be needing food , you idiot ! What 's for dinner ? Her heart is kaputski . Her spinal column is shattered . No , I can do nothing . She needs a whole new body . - I have body . - Hmm ? - But this is a toy . - Uh , uh ... Beg pardon ... is p-money 132 mobile bot . Mobo ? ♪ Yo , throw your hands in the air ♪ ♪ If you 's a more ball player , who 's ghetto ? ♪ Enough ! All right , Pavel , we will use your ... Mobo . Thank you , doctor . - Get busy ! - Yes , doctor . Hello . Welcome to Olga 's . What can I start you with ? - We 'd like a drink . - What can I get for you ? - Scotch on the rocks . - Vodka . - No . - No scotch ? Yes . Look ... - Vodka tastes like lighter fluid . - Yeah , I agree . - Scotch tastes like piss water . - No , it doesn 't . - But you just said that ... - vodka or nothing . - I 'd like a shot of vodka too . - Mister , are you expecting someone else ? Uh , no no , I ... I always order a drink for a dear departed friend . Okay . Do you need some time to think about your order ? No no no , we can wing it . All right , slow down . Easy ... sirloin steak . - No . - How would you like that cooked ? - What 's wrong with sirloin steak ? - Nothing is wrong , sir . - You just ordered it . - Fish is better for you . - Let 's do the sturgeon . - It 's too fishy . - Sirloin is too fishy ? - What about the chicken ? - Chicken is good . - Chicken is good . - I 'll take the chicken . - Okay . You get choice of soup or salad bar . - What 's the soup ? - Borscht . Pfft . Salad bar . Okay . I 'll be right back with your ... Drinks . Oh , in meantime , help yourself to the salad bar . Plates are up there . Hey ! Gross . Hey hey hey . Are you crazy ? I might a little piece of your brain , but the rest of me is me , and I 'll determine what goes in it ! I just want a little bit of coleslaw . - Is that asking too much ? - No . We have to agree . Here you go . Enjoy . Not so fast , Humphrey Bogart . All right , all right , we 'll do it fair and square . Let go ! We 'll line up . Whoever gets to their drink first , that 's it . You get to the vodka first , fine . If I get to the scotch first , that 's the way it is , okay ? Agreed . On the count of three . One ... Two , three ! Look , we should just calm down . Let 's just read the newspaper like normal people . - Jackie ? - Jackie ! - You ? - You ! Oh my god ! I 'm William Cole . Holy hell . If I 'm William Cole , - that must make you ... - Yegor , at your service ... Permanently . I 'm on fire ! Get out ! I can 't cool down . Hey ! Look , you 're part of me , and I 'm part of you . Neither of us like it , but that 's the way it is . We gotta find the woman that killed us both . Then we go to gypsy town . Ready . Systems on . Turn her up a little . - Can you hear me ? - Yes . I 'm sure this is all very new to you . - Do you know who you are ? - Jackie . That is correct , your name is Jackie . Unfortunately , you have had a terrible accident . No accident , no accident , - no accident . - You must not exert yourself . I made one strong chick . Jackie ... Tatoya . - Ow . - Jackie , no ! Your battery supply ... Jackie ! Gypsy town . Ungrateful Americans . We have big problem . If her power pack runs out before we find her , her brain will die for lack of oxygen . She 's running on backup power now . That is why we must find her and William Cole . Yes , we must . Well , get going ! " Go find him , Pavel . " What am I supposed to do ? Roll down the window , and yell , " here , freak ! Here , freak ! " ? He don 't even know who he is talking to . I am Pavel . Old " eye eagle " Pavel . I could find a whole haystack with only one needle . Power low . - Hey , who are you , freak ? - Hello , Uri . How do you know my name ? Hey , what do you want here ? - Need power . - What ? ! Power ? ! Hey , don 't touch that , damn it .

When the world laughed at you for your ideas about mitogenic radiation , how did you continue , huh ? What pushed you to find the answer even when you yourself didn 't even know that it existed , huh ? I don 't know where to turn . I have exhausted every possible approach from every conceivable angle , and still I have nothing to show for it . I ... I cannot get ... My little cells ... To accept other little cells which are foreign to themselves . Sometimes I wish I could just ... Build a wall between them so they can live together without even knowing that ... wait a minute . Wait a minute . A wall . That 's it . A wall of protein ... it binds them and separates them at the same time ! That 's it . That 's it ! Oh-ho , thank you ! Thank you , comrade Alexander .

 I brought tea . Here you go . Thank you . It 's delicious . Here you go . Asahina-san . Haruhi established the SOS Brigade back in May and we are already in the month of June . during that period I happened to be involved in a world-cramping incident ... let 's just leave that aside . Today 's story goes like this . Everyone ! We 're entering the baseball tournament ! 98 ) } Ninth 49 ) } City 76 ) } Amateur 436 ) } Baseball 471 ) } Tournament 459 ) } Accepting Teams 71 ) } Ninth 48 ) } City 75 ) } Amateur 410 ) } Baseball 452 ) } Tournament 447 ) } Accepting Teams 50 ) } Ninth 46 ) } City 73 ) } Amateur 383 ) } Baseball 430 ) } Tournament 440 ) } Accepting Teams Since that day nothing out of the ordinary ever happened ... 247 ) \ 1cH2D3236 \ bord0 } Thermodynamics 247 ) } Particle Theory 249 ) } Astrodynamics ... and I was able to enjoy a brief period of peace and tranquil tedium ... was it brief . Because ... Whenever her face lights up with that smile I end up being run ragged and exhausted . What did you say we 're entering ? This ! 409 ) } The Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya The Ninth City Amateur Baseball Tournament . So . Who 's entering ? In this grass-lot baseball tournament ? obviously ! When you say we are you including the rest of us ? { \ 3cH000000 } - We 'll need to find four more people . she only hears the things she wants to hear . Do you know the rules for baseball ? I know the rules . I joined the baseball team for a bit so I know the basics . But it was dead boring so I left immediately . So why do we have to participate in a tournament playing that dead boring baseball ? This is a chance to make our existence known around the world ! If we win this tournament it could be a chance to make the name SOS Brigade stand on its own ! It 's a great opportunity ! Right ? Mikuru-chan ? but ... Right ? yeah ? we 're aiming for the championship ! Not a single loss will be tolerated ! I really hate to lose ! Okay ? Why not ? Don 't give your consent so cheerfully . How about objecting every once in a while ? It sounds much more productive than walking around in search of ... in my opinion . So ? When 's the game ? This Sunday . The day after tomorrow ! ? That 's way too soon ! But I already turned in the application . Don 't worry . I named the team SOS Brigade ! There won 't be any mistakes in that department ! Where are you planning on pulling together the other members from ? Just grab any bored-looking people we see walking around . She 's serious about that . Got it . You just sit tight . Taniguchi and Kunikida probably don 't have anything to do . Those are fine ! Haruhi referred to classmates as objects . Let 's see ... huh ? Um ... my friend ... Then we 'll do that ! apparently . Wait . Asahina-san 's friend ? That 's making me a little worried . Her friend from when and where ? It 's okay . She 's from this time someone I met from my class . allow me to join in . I can think of an acquaintance who has expressed interest in our ... I 'll take care of it . let 's start training ! Training ! you say ? Right this instant ? That 's right ! Where ! ? Over there ! Okay ! Okay ! And so we ended up participating in a tomfoolery of a baseball tournament . Why is that ? The answer is simple . Haruhi was just bored . you . Let us use this place . too . What are you talking about ? We have to practice baseball right away . so leave . Like hell we 're gonna leave ! It 's just for a little while ! Mikuru-chan ? Um ... A predictable adolescent response . Okay ! Let 's start with a thousand hits ! Here we go ! The future of the SOS Brigade rests upon that ball ! Catch it ! This is the first I 've heard about our future resting upon such a minuscule ball . Another round ! Mikuru-chan ! Here we go ! It hurts ! Are you okay ? Can you stand ? Kyon-kun . If you 're nice to me it 'll happen again ... Hey ! Kyon ! Mikuru-chan ! Come back here ! She 's retiring due to injury ! That 's enough . the baseball team take the field ! Why us ? Okay ! That 's enough for today . Quite amazing . That was exactly one thousand . The fact that you counted to one thousand is what 's amazing . Nagato . Could you make it rain on the day of the game ? A huge one that 'll cancel the game . It is possible . it is not recommended . Why 's that ? Alterations to the local environmental data may result in aftereffects to this planet 's ecosystem . How long will these aftereffects last ? Between a few centuries and ten millennia . Then I guess we probably shouldn 't . Yes . And just like that here comes the day of the match ! It really didn 't need to come . So you 're Kyon-kun ? I 've heard a lot about you from Mikuru ! Um . Tsuruya-san . I 'm Taniguchi ! It 's a pleasure to meet you . I 'm Kunikida . Man ... I couldn 't turn down a request from my buddy Kyon ! { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } Taniguchi-kun ... boy ... right ? { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } I 'll remember that ! Kyon ! { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } Let 's have fun today ! Come here for a second . What are you thinking ! ? You 're going to have that thing play baseball ? I watched a game the other day . Thing " is a bit rude now . { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } The catcher ... That " thing " is still my sister . She introduced herself as an 11-year-old fifth grader . She 's such a sweet little girl that it 's hard to believe she 's related to you . { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } He hit a home run ! the baseball tournament we 're entering is open to the general public ! This isn 't Little League ! Miss Haruhi ! That is exactly why I brought my sister ! Our chance of victory is nil . this is Haruhi we 're talking about . Watch us end up winning by accident ! That would definitely be a pain in the ass . If we add a fifth grader into the mix ... { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } That 's why I was really happy when I got to come along today ! ... it 'd be a joke if we won . Very well . It 's a good enough handicap . I 'd feel bad if we slaughtered the other team . she seriously intends on winning . By the way we haven 't decided on a batting order or positions yet . What are we going to do ? I already thought that through . right ? One for batting order and one for field position . I 'm the pitcher and lead-off . So all you came up with was a method to decide . What ? Do you have a problem with that ? It 's a democratic method . They used lottery to choose their government in ancient Greece ! 207 ) \ 3aH55 } Taniguchi 176 ) \ 3aH55 } Yuki 200 ) \ 3aH55 } Tsuruya-san 119 ) \ 3aH55 } Kyon 116 ) \ 3aH55 } Mikuru-chan 80 ) \ 3aH55 } Koizumi-kun Don 't compare the ancient Greek government system to modern Japan batting order selection ! 0 ) \ 3aH55 } Kunikida 35 ) \ 3aH55 } Kyon 's Sister 9 ) } Tsuruya-san And you 're the only one who gets to choose your own position . How is that democratic ? - 20 } _ _ _ _ _ _ 0 } Name - 18 } _ _ _ _ _ _ 0 } Position - 47 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ - 15 ) } Haruhi Suzumiya - 47 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ - 7 ) } Pitcher - 43 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ - 13 ) } Mikuru-chan - 43 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ - 9 ) } Right - 38 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ - 9 ) } Yuki - 38 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ - 2 ) } Center - 39 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ - 4 ) } Kyon - 39 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ - 4 ) } Second well . - 40 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ - 5 ) } Kyon 's Sister - 40 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ - 5 ) } Left Looks like I 'll get to go home even sooner than expected . 44 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ 80 ) } Koizumi-kun 44 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ 80 ) } Catcher 157 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ 192 ) } Kunikida 157 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ 192 ) } First 270 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ 305 ) } Tsuruya-san 270 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ 305 ) } Third we were just told that ... 383 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ 416 ) } Taniguchi 383 ) } _ _ _ _ _ _ 416 ) } Short the Kamigahara Pirates . The leading candidate to win this tournament . The game is called at ten runs so now would be a good time to start packing up to go home . Play ball ! That was a totally weak pitch ! The rest of you follow my lead ! Please go easy on me ... Strike ! How dare you throw a real pitch at Asahina-san ! ? there will immediate brawling ! A brawling bash ! Strike ! Mikuru-chan ! Swing like this ! Like this ! Strikeout ! Hey ! Why aren 't you swinging the bat ! ? Strike ! Strike ! Strikeout ! Yuki ! You can 't hit the ball if you don 't swing ! Kyon ! You better get a hit ! You 're clean-up ! What can you possibly expect from a clean-up chosen through lottery ? Strike ! Haruhi doubled off this pitch ? Strike ! Strikeout ! Moron ! What are you doing ! ? Crap . Let 's shut them out ! Play ! Strike ! Strike ! Strikeout ! Nice pitching ! Too easy ! Too easy ! Foul ball ! If all you can throw is straight pitches in the strike zone ... I got it ! I got it ! you 're going to get hit . And our defense has more holes than an anthill in a savanna . No ! U-Um ... Like a sieve ! The fact that we only gave up two runs this inning ... Great play ! ... must be because the other team 's goddess of victory is running late . I suppose that everyone wants to take it easy on Sunday . Way to go ! 232 ) } SOS Brigade 266 ) } Kamigahara 427 ) } Pirates Strikeout ! our offensive in the top of the next inning came to an abrupt end ... Strikeout ! Strikeout ! 232 ) } SOS Brigade 266 ) } Kamigahara 427 ) } Pirates ... and our opponents easily built up their lead in the bottom . It looks like we can end this in the next inning . Out ! That 's a toughie . Just getting the bat on the ball took everything I had . It looks like we 're going to need that . Hey ! Timeout ! W-Wait ! Suzumiya-san ! S-Stop it ! { \ 3cH000000 } - Stupid ! Come on ! Get undressed and change ! Mikuru ! { \ 3cH000000 } - Looking good there . Can I take a picture ? It 's so cute ! It might go better with a ponytail . Come on . Start cheering . Um ... How do I do that ? Like this ! C 'mon ! Yell it loud and clear ! E-Everybody ! Please hit the ball ! Please do your best ! Just watch me ! Strikeout ! There 's no way I can hit that . No matter . I wasn 't expecting anything from you . Safe ! Mikuru-chan ! You better hit it this time ! { \ 3cH000000 } - Mikuru ! You can do it ! Asahina-san ! Strike ! Mikuru-chan ! This ! This ! What is she doing ? Is she trying to reduce the magic points of the opposing pitcher ? It would appear that she 's giving a sign . Did we ever decide on any signs ? No . However she 's probably signaling for a squeeze . A squeeze towards first with two outs ? Even one of those lame duck managers could do a better job than this . Presuming that Asahina-san 's chances of hitting the ball are practically none using a squeeze when least expected to surprise the opposing team may possibly cause the infield to commit an error or perhaps she thinks that even Asahina-san can at least manage to make contact with the ball . They 've all figured it out though . Strike ! Strikeout ! Mikuru-chan ! Come over here and buckle down for some pain ! This is punishment ! Punishment ! Let everyone look at your funny face . Please stop ... Are you an idiot ? It 's your fault for giving signs that make no sense . Just steal home by yourself or whatever . Things have taken a bad turn . but go ahead . Closed space has appeared on a scale never before witnessed . It appears to be expanding at an alarming rate . it will continue to expand and those will also continue to rampage around . Just because we 're losing ? She 's so full of it . You sound as though it doesn 't concern yourself but this incident is largely due to you . we drew lots to determine the batting order . you became clean-up . I 'm not particularly happy about it . You became the clean-up batter because Suzumiya-san desired it . It wasn 't coincidence . And then she was disappointed by your dismal performance . So sorry about that . In any case let us do everything possible to prevent the game from being called this inning . If the game ends now it will mean the end of this world . Come on ! We 're starting ! We must do all we can to hold them to two runs . Two outs . Runners on first and second . 232 ) } SOS Brigade 266 ) } Kamigahara 427 ) } Pirates Current score : 0-9 . The game will be over in another run . It 's coming towards me ! Make it ... Make it ! Amazing ! Nice play ! you ! { \ 3cH000000 } - That 's my buddy ! Picking up where we left off ... Your face is really close . What do you want ? when you and Suzumiya-san were in the other world how did you make it back ? Don 't remind me of that . If we use that method again it may get us out of this crisis again . I refuse . I thought you would say that . Then I shall go secure our means to victory . After all her interests should coincide with ours . Nagato-san 's finally ... Is something up with her ? She seems to be reciting an incantation . Incantation ? What 's that ? Um ... Classified information . huh ... That was incredible ! Where are you hiding that strength ? This has been modified with a boost in attribute data . What 's that mean ? Homing mode . That ball 's gone ! is it . boy ... There 's a limit to ridiculousness . Whatever the case any more of this and we 'll be in trouble . In a variety of ways ... That 's enough . I see . Strike ! Strike ! Strike ! I 'd forgotten but there is a time limit of ninety minutes per game . Which means the next inning will be dropped . we 'll win . Is it really okay for us to win ? We cannot afford the alternative . Thanks to our efforts the expansion of closed space has been checked . it 'll be a walk-off loss . There 's no need to think about how bad of a mood Haruhi will be in then . And so I have an idea concerning that . Seriously ? Very serious . To make it through this inning while giving up a minimal number of runs this is our only remaining option . boy ... Ball ! Hey ! Be serious about it ! I let you take my place ... you have to treat everyone ! I know . the fate of the world rests on my pitching . The world sure isn 't worth much these days . Thanks to this " Mysterious Ball " ... Strike ! ... as christened by yours truly it appears we 've avoided destruction . S-Strike two ! Strikeout ! The next pitcher struck out in three pitches ... Strikeout ! ... and what would probably be the last batter had chalked up two strikes . Strike two ! Kyon ! Finish it with the next pitch ! I don 't need you to tell me to end the game . Kamigahara Pirates . Lucky ! Nagato ! Pick up the ball and throw it ! Hurry up ! Second ! { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } Here ! Huh ? I 'm terribly sorry . We happen to be a slightly unreasonable group . G-Game over ! Thanks to Nagato 's bogus magic ... but ... What shall we do about the next game ? Continuing onto the next round would be inexcusable to the Kamigahara Pirates . Besides ... The truth is that I need to go help my colleagues soon . too . Let 's forfeit . That sounds best . It would appear that it is a bad idea to allow Suzumiya-san to be bored . We should take that into consideration during future endeavors . right ? Koizumi had to leave because something came up . My legs and arms are completely worn out . I guess that 's fine . I 'm pretty hungry anyway . Let 's go have lunch ! yeah . Thank you so much ! Not at all . I 'll be going then . Wait . About that bat ... I didn 't know I had it in me . { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } So you 're Yuki Nagato-chan ? I must have talent for baseball . { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } I 've heard a lot about you from Mikuru . Everybody eat up ! It 's all Kyon 's treat ! well . I managed to get my hands on some unexpected extra cash . Here 's to the success of the Kamigahara Pirates . C 'mon ! C 'mon ! Swing harder ! Sorry I 'm late ! Hey !

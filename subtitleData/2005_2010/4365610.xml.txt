 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ... What does this mean ? I keep seeing it in my dreams , John . It means something . Weirdo . Kook . Nut . I 've been reading the dictionary . I don 't sleep . Whatever happened with the explosion flipped a switch . You don 't know what you do . I love you , John , and you love me . - Your name is ? - It 's Riley . What 's the matter ? Never brought a girl home before ? Riley climbed out John 's window . - Now is not the time for this . - Well , when is the time ? You bring danger into Riley 's life . And I 'm gonna keep seeing Riley even if everyone thinks it 's a bad idea . I understand that it 's a bad idea . So don 't worry about it and be happy you 're a machine . I 'm a machine . I can 't be happy . Anything yet ? I 've dumped about 50,000 websites . There are hundreds of companies with three dots in the logo . Organic fruit . Candles . Dog collars . Baby wipes . Ice cream . Nothing screams Skynet like baby wipes and ice cream . Keep looking . It is something you saw in a dream . And written in blood . So it means something . Will you just keep looking ? Tomorrow . I 'm beat . You never sleep . Make yourself useful . Most efficient killing machine ever invented . You got her doing laundry . You do never sleep . One glazed . One rainbow sprinkle . One cinnamon twist . You never forget , do you ? No , I don 't . So how was Mexico ? Did you get to see your buddy down there ? Where 's the rest of it ? He was gone when we got there . After you went all that way ? Bummer . Yes . It was a bummer . Is your brother still seeing that crazy blonde ? Yes . It 's become a problem . She snuck out the window one night and left the alarm off . We got robbed . No way . Did you catch who did it ? Everything worked out fine . That 's a pretty zen attitude . " The robbed that smiles steals something from the thief . " You read Othello . You asked me to . Did you like it ? It was more violent than I expected . I should 've warned you . Everything worked out fine . You 're not eating your donuts . Later . Do you have A History of California Field Artillery ? I 'm interested in the ancient muzzle-loading rifles used during the Modoc Indian War . In the California room . I 've a big week . Paper due on Thursday . Peter the Great 's war with the Turks and the technological modernization of imperial Russia . It 's better than it sounds . What are you lookin ' at ? Him . I know him . Not unless you 're about , 110 years old . That photo 's from 1920 . See , December 31 , 1920 . What was he doing in 1920 ? What is this picture from ? Famous New Year 's Eve Speakeasy fire during Prohibition . 43 people died . There were rumors someone threw a Molotov cocktail through the door . Lots of rivalries between the different Speakeasy Clubs . I need to know what happened to him . Episode 2x11 : Self Made Man V 1.00 John , can you come get me ? - Where ? What 's wrong ? - At 341 Grove Way in Van Nuys . Can you please just come ? Most periodicals from the ' 20s haven 't been transferred to digital , so this could take awhile . But fire that big , there 's always survivor stories . Like with the Titanic . There 's only one Titanic survivor left , Millvina Dean . Course , she was only two months old , so her story isn 't particularly instructive . - You 're a very happy person . - I am ? I don 't know that many happy people . Well , I guess that 's my own little survivor story . Having bone cancer was like being the Titanic and the iceberg . So , why do you want to find out about this guy ? I 'm interested in the past . It effects everything in the future . " Those who don 't know history are destined to repeat it . " Or die . - What 's wrong ? - Little cold in here . It 's 76 degrees . Check this one . D6 . That 's him . That 's the guy from the fire . - Who 's that other man ? - Rudolph Valentino . The greatest silent film star of all time ? You kids today with your rock and roll and your obsession with medieval siege weapons . Rudolf Valentino and Myron Stark at the premiere of " The Sheik " . What was Stark doing there ? Living it up on the red carpet . I enjoyed your film very much , Mr. Valentino . - Thank you . - Although I thought your decision to return the gun to Lady Diana to protect herself from the caravan of thieves was misguided given that she was a security risk . Stark is shaking hands with Valentino . But look at his eye line . He 's looking at that man . " Rupert Chandler . " Check out that hat . We could search the city and county records for more on Stark . - Where are they ? - Basement . Vital records . But it 's locked and I don 't have the keys . You 'll have to come back in the morning and talk with Barry . 'Scuse me . Where are you going ? Hey , excuse me . Hi . - Looking for someone ? - Yeah , Riley . Blonde girl . I barely know Mike 's friends . Gail Silver . Mike 's mom . Oh , hi . I 'm John . Let me help you with these . - This is the wrong kind . - You said " beer . " How come you never introduced me to your friend John ? 'Cause he 's not my friend . Some loner weirdo who dropped out of school . - What are you doing here ? - Just looking for somebody . And being helpful . You could learn a lesson from him . What , like sucking up to mom ? Is the tv in your room broken ? It 's hard to relax when you 're out here . I gotcha . I 'm goin ' . I didn 't know you could just send your mom off to her room like that . Yeah . So ? Who you lookin ' for ? Girl named Riley . Oh , I know Riley . Oh , got your beer ! Thanks . Okay , thanks . Hi . What are you doing ? You called me all upset . - What 's goin ' on ? - Oh , that ... that was just ... This guy was bothering me , that 's all . - Well , I have a car . Let 's go . - No . It 's ... It 's cool now . - Come on . We can hang out a little bit . - Hang out ? I only came to get you . I 'm sorry . It 's cool . We can ... we can ... we can stay . - Are you trying to get me fired ? - No . - Then what are you doin ' down here ? - Looking for records on Myron Stark . I don 't think he was who everyone thinks he was . I let you in after hours whenever you want . And for you to go and do this , exactly what I tell you not to , - really not cool . - I need the information . And I need this job . You broke the lock . - I 'll fix it . - Just put it back . Put it all back . Don 't . I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have gone down there . Forget it . It 's no big deal . Yes , it is . We 're friends . I don 't really have many friends . Actually , I don 't have any friends . You ? That ... that can 't be true . So did you find anything out down there ? There 's no record of Myron Stark before the fire . - Dead end . - I don 't like dead ends . He could 've been an immigrant . Came through Ellis Island , shortened his name . Worked his way up from nothing . It 's the immigrant spirit . Single-minded pursuit of a goal . Never giving up . Buying into the American dream . An effective strategy . Either that or he robbed banks . What ? Can you show me police records ? Shortly after 2 : 00 pm , a lone robber held up the La Brea Savings and Loan . Witnesses say the masked man armed with a Thompson submachine gun and a daring disregard for human life , opened fire . Eight citizens were felled and did not live to tell about it . This is the third bank robbed in this fashion in recent weeks . Detective , can you tell us how much was looted from the vault ? Over $ 70,000 in cash , silver , and liberty bonds . - Was the robber injured in the fray ? - Police let fly with a hail of bullets . The robber was hit with nearly 30 rounds , but escaped on foot . How in God 's name did he survive ? That has not been ascertained . A manhunt is underway . You really think he robbed banks ? It 's a very effective strategy . But why ? What did he need it for ? To buy into the American dream . Stark bought parcels of land in the San Fernando Valley , Burbank , Sunland , Van Nuys . Two days after the last heist . What 'd he do with all that land ? He built houses . I found this application for a business license . Construction . This is Worldwide News . Myron Stark versus Rupert Chandler . A classic David versus Goliath . Real estate magnate and builder Rupert Chandler was the undisputed king of the expanding San Fernando valley . But along came a young upstart , Myron Stark . What started as a one-man operation soon grew into a thriving business that went head to head with the largest builder in the county . It 's said Stark spoke six languages , paid double the wages of his competitors , and treated all of his workers equally regardless of their employment history or citizen status . Stark himself could always be found shoulder to shoulder with his workers , a pickaxe in his strong hands . Soon Stark Company became a thorn in the side of his rival . His meteoric rise threatened to topple the " King Chandler " from his throne . Chandler 's top foreman , Fred Jeffers , was recently asked about the rivalry . To hear Jeffers tell it , " We 're not worried . " Fly-by-nights like Stark come and go . " Chandler 's an established company with contracts booked through 1925 . " We 'll crush him like a bug . " Upon hearing Jeffers' fighting words , Stark reported to reply simply , " We 'll see . " Here 's more on Chandler and Jeffers . And something really strange . Fred Jeffers , Rupert Chandler 's man , went missing back in 1925 . Was never found . - What is this ? - A 17-round Glock 9mm semiautomatic . - Why do you have it ? - In case I need it . Have you ever used it ? Yes . - Are you in trouble ? - No . - Are you afraid of someone ? - Afraid ? I 've seen cuts on your face . There was one last week . You were wearing makeup , but ... Sometimes I get into fights . - Why ? - My brother . There are people out to hurt him . I protect him . Who protects you ? I do . Why are we doing this ? Why is Myron Stark so important ? He was doing something , and it doesn 't make sense to me . I need to find out what it was . None of this makes sense to me . Not you , not the gun , not the guy in the photograph . I know . I 've never fired a gun before . Do you want to ? Sure , but ... Wait . No . We can 't do this here . Grip it with both hands . Squeeze the trigger slowly . Slowly . Oh , yeah . Oh , my God . I 'm terrible at this . John . No , I don 't know how . What , you live in a cave ? Come on . What am I supposed to do ? I have no idea . I just pushed those buttons at random . And you sucked . Hey , check you out , Mr. Normal . Kill him , Alex . Come on , Johnny . I 'm rooting for you . Dude , you suck . Come on . Kill him , Alex . - I 'm gonna go . Stay if you want . - No , John , wait . - This was a mistake . - I 'm coming with you . You 're going ? - With that weirdo ? - I 'm sorry . We have to go . No , no , no . Wait . Give me my lighter back . Your what ? You took my lighter . - No . Come on , John . Let 's go . - No , no , no . Give it to me . - Give it to me . - Get off me . - You leave her alone . - No one 's talking to you , weirdo . - Don 't . Stop . - Come on . - Watch out . - Give it to me , you bitch . - Take the damn lighter . - Come on , John . Let 's get out of here . I 'm out here on Mulholland drive where a hiker has discovered what appears to be the body of a man who died over 60 years ago . Tom jacobs was out for an early morning walk when he spotted a piece of metal in the ravine . Tom ? I saw what looked like the bumper of a car . But when I got closer , I could see that it was one of those old-timey ones , you know , like you see in the movies . And then I saw the bones . Personal effects found in the vehicle reveal the remains to be those of Fred Jeffers , a man who disappeared in the 1920s . Wait ! What are you doing ? What do you want ? Please stop ! " Jeffers ' disappearance was a terrible blow for Chandler , " who endured a string of tragedies starting with the death of his son , " who died on new year 's eve , 1920 . " New year 's eve , 1920 . Let 's get ' em out of here . That 's Rupert Chandler 's boy . Let 's cover him up . Let 's get him out of here . Come on . Will Chandler died in the speakeasy fire . And Myron Stark was there . So there must be a connection . I thought you were gonna kill that guy . Why 'd you call me ? Because . I wanted you to come . Weird way of showing it . The flirting with Mike thing ? I 'm a teenage girl , John . We do that kind of crap to guys we like . The loner weirdo ? I don 't get it . Never gotten it . My old foster parents are these ' 60s hippies . Always talking like they were single-handedly saving the World because they recycled . They called me the deviant . Like , " The deviant got a " C " in math . " " Should we take the deviant to see Bruce Hornsby ? " That 's why I came up to you that day , John . Because I thought since you 're a weirdo , you might get me . My foster parents used to call me " the delinquent " . So you did take the lighter . I like shiny things . Bad habit . What happened to your real parents ? They died when I was little . In a fire . Why were you in a foster home ? You have your mom . She was in a mental hospital . That explains things . She was engaged once . He was a pretty cool guy . Didn 't work out , but he was kind of the only friend we had . Little while ago , he helped us with something . There was an accident and his new wife died . And he left . That 's what happens . I shouldn 't be around people . Is that why you went nuclear on mike ? No , that 's ... that 's other stuff . Do you want to talk about it ? Sometimes , yes . Mostly no . But sometimes yes . I found Will Chandler 's obituary . I 'm kind of peeing right now . Can 't it wait ? 400 people came to his funeral . He had a lot of friends . His father had a lot of money . There 's a difference . I think Stark killed him . We don 't even know if they knew each other . And if Stark wanted to kill Chandler , why take out 43 innocent people ? It happens . Do you ever think about dying ? About what ? Or about suicide ? Why would I think about that ? Because there 's something wrong with you . Gee , don 't ever look for work as a counselor . I 've never thought about killing myself . Not for a minute . It would destroy my mom , for one . I couldn 't do that to my family , to the people who love me . Could you ? Anyways , I 'm not sick anymore . I mean , I have to get a scan every six months . But so far I 'm clean . Earlier when I cross-referenced the names of survivors from the fire , this woman 's name came up in a documentary about the roaring ' 20s . It might tell us more about what happened inside the speakeasy . Film vault 's on the top floor . You 'll have to go alone . - Why ? - No wheelchair access . You 're really strong . I work out . Look at all this . DVDs are all right , but this is the real deal . Silver nitrate . Raw . Before film makers figured out all the tricks . Pure humanity on film . None of that computer generated , digital crap they do today . All these people captured , frozen in time . They never age . I mean , 100 years could pass . They 'll still be here . Still look exactly the same . It would be nice , wouldn 't it ? Freeze yourself in a moment . The best moment of your life . Have things never change . Be beautiful . Healthy . Strong . Anyway ... Don 't let me get all A.E. Housman on you . The documentaries are up there . We would go out to the gin joints every weekend . We 'd drink , and smoke , and dance the Black Bottom , the Charleston , the Shimmy . I was a real bearcat back then . And I was crazy in love with this prizefighter . We were together there , the night when the fire started . He was helping everybody out . And I just remember ... sitting on the curb ... crying . People said that someone threw a bomb in the door . Now , to tell you the truth , I was pretty zozzled . That 's what we called it then . But I didn 't see a bomb . What I did see was this ... this flash of blue light and sparks , then the craziest thing . This man in the middle of the room , naked as a jaybird . I don 't know . Maybe I just imagined the whole thing . Who knows ? Probably the liquor talking . The fire , it was an accident . Sounds like there was some electrical problem . He didn 't mean to kill all those people . No . Of course not . It 's just like in the Wizard of Oz when the house falls on the witch . Give me your clothes . Where are you going ? I know what he was looking at . He was measuring the stars ' radial velocity , the distance in parsecs , and the cartesian coordinates . What ? Why ? To pinpoint the date . You can tell the date by looking at the sky ? Stellar motion can be used to calculate what the sky will look like for hundreds of years in the future or the past . Why is the date so important ? It 's not . Unless it 's the wrong date . Myron Stark was in the wrong place at the wrong time . " If we cry because the sun has gone out of our lives , " our tears can prevent us from seeing the stars . " Chandler 's eulogy for his son ? " Today is a day for mourning . " But it is also a day to remember my son . " A gifted young man with a grand heart . " A budding architect , his dream was to build Pico Tower " on the corner of 3rd and Pico . " That was his land , the soil where his dreams were to take root . " It will remain his land forever , never to be sold or developed . " Instead , his legacy will live on in a memorial garden " I will plant there in his honor . " That can 't be right . There is a Pico Tower in downtown LA . It 's an architectural landmark . We took a field trip there in third grade . Someone must 've built it . Tax records . They show Chandler 's rivalry with Stark cost him everything . His business went under in July 1925 . His assets were auctioned off to pay off his debt , including the property at 3rd and Pico . Bankruptcy . Tragic accidents . The death of a beloved son . It 's like the family 's cursed . Mr. Chandler , I 'm Myron Stark . - Do I know you ? - No , you don 't know me . Mr. Chandler 's in a hurry . I 'm interested in purchasing a piece of property . 3rd and Pico . - That land 's not for sale . - I 'll pay twice what it 's worth . Are you deaf ? He said it 's not for sale . Does it say who bought it ? The Pico property ? M.S. So he not only bought the land , but he designed it himself ? The building . - It 's about the building . - What is ? Stark accidentally killed the man who was going to build it , so he had to build it himself . Everything he did was to drive Chandler under and get him to sell that land . There must be a reason why Stark needed to build it . You wanna know the really weird thing ? Stark disappeared two weeks before the building opened in May of 1927 . - Disappeared ? - Fell off the face of the Earth . Never seen again . What 's happened at Pico Tower since it was built ? Anything important ? - Anything on new year 's eve ? - New year 's eve when ? - Any new year 's eve . - Not that I can see . In fact , it 's closed now . They had to retrofit after the last earthquake . I 'm not sure when they 're reopening . I thought you left . What are you doing back here ? Are you all right ? What happened ? I 'm fine . Your brother again ? I 'm fine . You never touched your donuts . - I wasn 't hungry . - Your muscles are weak . It was difficult for you to pull the trigger . And you 've lost 8 % of your body weight in the past two weeks . When I carried you to the film fault , I weighed you . Wait , what ? This whole night , the entire time , you 've been examining me ? What the hell is going on here ? Your cancer is back . You have a secondary tumor in the long bone of your arm and possibly your lungs . - Are you joking ? - No . Then you 're crazy , you don 't know what you 're talking about . Ewing 's sarcoma . First identified in the 1920s ... I know what it is , okay ? I 'm the one in here ! No wonder you don 't have any friends . You can 't just do things like that . You can 't just show up whenever you need somethin ' . You can 't carry a gun around and freak people out , and walk into the bathroom when a guy 's taking a leak and ask him if he 's gonna kill himself . And you can 't just blurt things out like " You have cancer " , especially to someone who 's already had it . You have no clue , do you ? You have no idea what it 's like to have something inside of you , something that 's damaged . It 's like a bomb ... waiting to go off . I need to finish my paper . You should make an appointment with your oncologist . - The tumor 's still small . - Get out . - Where were you all night ? - Out . Carbon chain C24 . Lanolin and Red Dye # 27 . You were with Riley . We 're closed . Is Eric here ? He works the night shift . He lets me in . I have no idea . They just called and asked me to come in . Sorry . Do you like donuts ? I have one glazed , one rainbow sprinkle , one cinnamon twist .

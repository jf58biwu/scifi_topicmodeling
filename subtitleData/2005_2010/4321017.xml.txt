 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... That 'll take you directly to who has the sword , and that will lead you to MacPherson . Who Who ? I wasn 't here when everything went down between Artie and MacPherson , but I know it was bad . It 's called the past rearing its ugly head . And someone out there is running around using ... That 's right , someone , and that someone is MacPherson . He wanted more than the sword . He wanted to mess us up as a team . Now it 's up to you to stop him . Hello , Arthur . Done . I win . It 's not a race . Said the tortoise to the hare . You know , in the story , the tortoise actually wins . It 's a fairy tale . How is a turtle going to beat a rabbit ? It 's not a fairy tale . It 's a fable , a life lesson . Slow and steady wins the race . Okay , here 's a life lesson , Pete fast , Pete win . You all finished ? Hey . Hey , Artie . Artie . Yeah ? If you were making a bet , who 's faster , a turtle or a rabbit ? Yeah . You finished the reports ? Yeah . Who are these going to ? Not Mrs. Frederic . Yeah , she doesn 't seem like the paperwork type . No , these go above all our pay grades . Who ? Myka , one day you 'll know all answers to all questions . Just not today . Okay . Fine . Enjoy your top secrets . I just got to go . I just can 't leave that courier waiting . What A courier ? What is this , the Wells Fargo Wagon ? Haven 't you ever heard of e-mail ? No , no , no . That 's not nearly secure enough , because we ... It doesn 't matter . You guys are having a day to yourselves , right ? Have fun . Claudia 's doing chores . And I 'll see you later . Doing chores where ? Uh ... In the Warehouse . Scalpel . Thank you , Nurse . There 's an awful lot of blood . I think I need some suction . Ganza ! Good as new . And get into the corners this time . Don 't make me push you . Go on . Ew , warm . Mmm . Frosty goodness . Okay . " Repair auto-vac . " Slice-o-pie . " Tighten and lubricate zip line . " It sounds kind of dirty when you say it like that . God , ancient junk-oleum . You got to update this turd some day , Artie . Hey , be careful . No . No , no , no , no . Crap . Crappity , crap , crap , crap ! Oh , my God . This is not good ! This is not going to look good on my report card . Oh , my God . Okay , don 't panic . Oh , my God . WWAD ? What would Artie do ? Um ... Momentum . Got to get momentum . All right . Come on , momentum , let 's go . No , no , no , no , no . This sucks ! So if it isn 't Mrs. Frederic , then who 's getting those reports ? I don 't know . Mr. Frederic ? Claudia ? I brought donuts . Donut . It 's chocolate . Mmm . What 's " AD " ? Artifact disturbance . You know , you really need to read the manual . That can 't be good . Claudia ? Claudia ! Um ... Sorry . Yeah , I was just wondering ... I was hoping that you could take a message to the higher-ups for me . This MacPherson situation , I realize that they prefer a hands-off approach , but they ... You 're talking . We don 't talk . Oh . I didn 't think there was a rule . I just thought you weren 't particularly social . I see I was right about that . God . Hi . She would like a word . I 'm sure she would . Let 's just follow the zip line . She 's bound to turn up . I just hope she 's okay , you know . Uh , Claudia 's like bamboo . You can bend her all you want , she 'll never break . This is hers . How do you know ? We have to get rid of Artie 's BeDazzler . Hello . Hmm . Is that a dodgeball ? How did that get in here ? Hell , no . Um ... Did that just do what I think it did ? Yeah . Yeah . Gosh ! Is that thing having babies , or ... Yeah , look . Okay , okay , let 's get out of here . Okay . Those things hit us every time we look away . Yeah , I 'm going to go with you on that so I don 't end up with a concussion . Um , ooh ... The screen . What ? Right ? Let 's read the screen . Yes . " Baylor Dodgeball . " Used for military dexterity and agility training . " Multiplies upon contact . " That we already know . " Acquired after the bludgeoning deaths of five cadets in 1972 . " Bludgeoning is bad . Agreed . Agreed . Okay , there 's a neutralizing station around the corner . There should be . Okay . Ah ! Ah ! Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Ready ? On three . Okay . Three . Let 's see how these puppies like a neutralizer flea bath . Why isn 't it working ? Okay , this is bad . What 's happening ? Why isn 't it working ? I don 't know . It 's busted . Okay , what do we do now ? Plan B. What 's Plan B ? I was hoping that you knew . No . Okay , wait . What 's that one ? " Breathe underwater . " " Hear colors . " Okay . " Grow fingernails fast . " " Summon locusts . " That 's not ... They 're dodgeballs . Yes , yes , that 's already established . That 's how you win at dodgeball . You have to catch it . No , these are too fast . And what about that whole death-by-bludgeoning thing ? No , no , no , no . Look , you look away , right ? And when they go for you , I 'll catch one . I think we should go with Plan C. What 's Plan C ? Well , I run away and you get pummeled . Look ! Pete ? Pete ? Who smells like tuna fish now , Ralph Brunsky ? Who ? Huh ? Who ? Oh , I was just having a little playground flashback . Oh . Hi , there . Welcome to Ted 's . I 'm Theadora , but everybody calls me Ted . Party of one ? No , no , I 'm meeting that woman right over there , and it 's rarely a party . Hello . Oh , Arthur , have a seat . Why are we meeting here ? We need to have a chat . The pie of the day is banana cream . I highly recommend it . Made it myself . Yeah , a steak , bloody , black coffee , two pieces of the pie . Two ? Um , just a house salad . Leena 's got me on a diet . Maybe just one piece of that pie , ' cause she made it herself . How are things at the Warehouse ? They 're good . They 're fine . A little chaotic , but it 's a good kind of chaos . And the missions ? No one 's been killed . You can 't ask for more than that . And we have an excellent retrieval rate . What about the incidents in Paris or Las Vegas or Colorado ? Mrs. Frederic , you know all about those . Why are you asking me about them ? I 'm forgetful . Refresh my memory . You were saying about Paris ? Claudia , there 's half a donut in the office . How far do you think she could have gotten before the zip line snapped ? Could be the other end of the Warehouse . There 's an end ? I hope so . Duck and cover . Okay , that was bigger than usual . To hell with this . I 'm going to see if I can spot her from up here . Well , be careful . Whoa . What is it ? Go down the aisle , cross two over and turn right . It 's Leena 's . But how ? And there 's a Claudia-shaped hole in the roof . Claudia ? Are you here ? Wait , you guys ! No , no , no , no ! Don 't close the door ! Thank God . We were following the zip line , and the ... Yeah , no , I 'm good . I mean , we 're all trapped in here for eternity , but otherwise I 'm solid . Yeah . Okay . Let 's just get back to the office so we can fix the ... What What ? What the hell ? This is what I 've been saying . First the goo doesn 't work , Mmm-hmm . Then one of those static balls tries to cook us and now , a clingy house . The Warehouse is in a bad mood today . FYI , if anyone has to use the bathroom , don 't flush . Trust me . Okay . Okay , you know what ? Just ... We just have to wait and think about this for a second . New plan . Scoring that an 8.5 . Next time , you got to stick the landing ! Let 's all just stop and think about this a second . That 's a good plan . Good plan . Claudia , did you try climbing back out of the same hole that you fell in ? Yeah , came right back in through the fireplace . I don 't recommend it . And you trust Pete and Myka ? With my life . They 're consummate professionals . Mrs. Frederic , I have to ask you , why specifically ... Excuse me , we 're having a private ... Do you mind ? Oh , no , that 's all right . Okay . What is he ... Very sorry . Private party . Wait , what is going on ? I thought they would never leave . Okay , here we go . You be careful now . This is a hot plate . I think we can begin . Mr. Valda ? Hello , Irene . Mr. Valda , nice to see you again . This is Agent Nielsen . Just a minute . What is this ? That 's a house salad . Bering and Lattimer are consummate professionals . Thank you , Theadora . So , as you stated in the past , Agents Bering and Lattimer 's mission was ... Look . Do you mind telling me exactly what is happening here ? Arthur , Mr. Valda 's asking the questions . Please don 't interrupt him . Yeah . Well , I don 't think I 'm going to be answering any questions until you tell me what this is about . Sometimes he forgets we answer to a higher authority . What higher authority ? The ... The Regents . These are the Regents ? The Regents meet here ? They do today . Do you really expect me to believe ... What exactly were you expecting , Agent Nielsen ? Hooded , cloaked figures standing in half-light around a perpetually burning flame ? He 's seen too many movies . You know , I just would have thought that ... This waitress is a Regent ? John Adams was a farmer , Abraham Lincoln was a small-town lawyer . Plato , Socrates were teachers , Jesus was a carpenter . To equate judgment and wisdom with occupation is , at best , insulting . Yeah , that 's not what I meant . I know what you meant . Who would you have control the Warehouse ? Kings ? Popes ? Politicians ? There 'd be nothing left of it . Yeah . No , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . It 's just , you know , I didn 't think ... Yes , that 's one of the reasons we needed to speak with you . Your reluctance to think . Irene ? Mrs. Frederic . Thank you , Theadora . So as I was saying , you stated in the past that Agents Bering and Lattimer 's mission was to " Snag it , bag it and tag it , " correct ? Yeah , well , you know , I mean , I said that . I didn 't mean to denigrate the job description . Yet in their brief tenure as field agents , they managed to destroy James Braid 's chair ... If you just let me explain . Lewis Carroll 's mirror . That wasn 't destroyed . Your agents released a malevolent entity into the Warehouse , allowing it access to dangerous artifacts . It was an accident . It was a total accident . It is not uncommon for artifacts to be occasionally destroyed for the greater good . And Agents Lattimer and Bering , I mean , they 've repeatedly shown bravery , they 've shown quick-thinking . They 're an excellent team , and they 're probably the best agents that the Warehouse has ever had . Arthur , their abilities are not in question here . Oh . This is about me ? Not only you . Your former partner . MacPherson ? Okay , okay , so this version of the BB is in the Warehouse because ... It 's an artifact . But can this whole place be an artifact ? Like , is that even possible ? Yeah , pretty much anything is possible . Okay , so maybe there was an artifact in the original that they couldn 't take out , right ? Mmm-hmm . So they just moved the whole thing . And rebuilt the new one without it . Look for anything here that 's different from our BB . All right . Okay , that was kind of cool . All right . We had this little , like , group-think thing going on . Gold stars all around . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Hey . I do not recognize that chair . You were sleeping in it last week . What about this ugly lamp ? Those light bulbs burnt out a month ago , but this ... This is new . Or old . It 's fused to the wall . This is it . Huh . It 's a painting of this room . And we can 't leave this room . Seems like quite the coinky-dink , don 't you think ? Yeah , how very Salvador Dali . Do you think this painting 's keeping us here ? Maybe . Pete , look at the lamp . What ? Okay , now look at the painting . Claudia put it back in a different spot . It changed because of what you did . Okay , okay . So maybe if I do something to the picture ... That happens . Sick ! After you . Okay . Your turn . Don 't mind if I do . Don 't even bother . At least that was new . Man , you know what ? This thing is useless . Did I do that ? Well , neither of us did . I can see the Warehouse . Okay , there 's a letter opener , if I remember ... Yes . Okay . Okay . Let 's go . All right . Safe and sound . What ? That . Maybe we should have stayed inside . We need to get back to the office . No need . " What are you doing wasting time installing backup terminals in the aisle , " foolish red-haired girl ? " Because you never know when you might need one , Artie . Nice . Hey-oh . Okay , looks like the problem is in the Gooery . What 's a Gooery ? I 'm guessing it 's Claudia-speak for the Neutralizer Processing Center . Uh-huh . Right . Of course . Well , it 's Chapter 197 in the manual . It 's 1,000 pages long . I 'll wait for the movie . Okay , the Neutralizer Processing Center is what pumps the purple goo through the Warehouse , creating a stability field . Yeah , it 's like all the gack in here are nuclear rods , right ? As long as there 's coolant , it 's all good . The Gooery jakes out the coolant . It keeps the artifacts from getting all artifact-y on their own . Okay , so the Gooery , cool name by the way , needs to go back online . Man with a plan . Okay , so does Chapter 198 say what happens if we don 't get it working again ? The same thing that happens to the nuclear rods without the coolant , except probably worse . We 've got maybe half an hour left . What 's the fastest way there ? Let me see . We got to go through aisle Haddonfield 79 , then loop around Carlsbad 22 ... No , no , no , no . Why don 't we just go straight through here ? Because that 's the Dark Vault . Okay . See ? Now , I know what that is . Didn 't read the manual . That 's where all the dangerous stuff is . Yeah , like mega dangerous , dude . Mondo . Okay , okay , but we still ... We can 't loop around . I say we take the risk . I agree . It 's not often that I agree , but I agree . Guys , if we 're going to do this thing , let 's do this thing . Wait , no , no , no . You 're not going anywhere , Claud . You 're going to stay put . I 'm coming with . No , no . We 're the agents . We 're the ones that agreed to risk our lives , not you . Yeah , but this is my home , too . You might need my help . She 's right . She has read the manual . Am I never going to hear the end of that ? She knows this place , okay ? I say that she comes with . Please . Okay , fine , but you stick close and you do exactly as we say . All right . Suicide mission with the team . Kind of exciting . I 'm excited . Come on . And , in attempting to save Joshua Donovan , you placed his sister , yet another civilian , in danger . I 'm sorry . Excuse me , please . If this is about MacPherson , then why am I being asked about cases that have absolutely nothing to do with MacPherson ? Agent Nielsen , I will ask the questions . It might be wise to let this run its course for now . All right , fine . Fine . Yes . Yes . In saving Joshua , I maybe put Claudia in a little danger , but I promised her that if ... You promised ? You promised ? It sounds as if personal feelings became involved in professional judgment . This has been an issue in the past , has it not ? It may have come up , but his artifact-retrieval rate is excellent . It 's the highest in years . Thank you . It 's simply the facts . Very well , then . The facts . Thank you , Theadora . Did you or did you not , on two separate occasions , involve Daniel Dickinson , A high-ranking Secret Service officer , in Warehouse 13 matters , all of which were classified at the highest level ? Yes . We have a unique relationship with the United States government , a relationship that your actions have now complicated . I contacted a fellow government official in the normal course of performing my job , a job to which I have dedicated the last 40 years of my life . No one 's questioning your dedication , Arthur . What we are questioning , Agent Nielsen , is your future . It 's sealed with an omega-level security code . Can you hack it ? Pope , Catholic , bear , woods , you know the drill . And done . Man , this place is creep-tastic . Okay . Don 't look , don 't touch . Just keep moving . These objects are so dangerous they can only be controlled by purple containment fields . Why are the neutralizer systems still working in here ? Backup generators because everything 's so dangerous . Don 't worry . They should hold up long enough for us to Realize my karma sucks . We 're starting to lose them . Just keep moving . This is going to take me a minute . Is it a different code ? Yeah , I gotta use an FTL ASCII binary algorithm . Did you just make that up ? Hey , little guy . What are you in for ? Almost there . Hang in there , guys . And we 're good . Okay , let 's go . Pete ? Pete ? Pete ? Pete , what are you ... - Whoa , whoa , whoa . - Wait , wait , wait , wait . Pete . Crap . Pete ! Can you hear us ? Pete , what are you doing ? Pete , come to the door . Pete ! Pete , can you hear me ? Pete , are you okay ? Pete . Pete , are you okay ? Attention , Warehouse agents . Mrs. Frederic . Thank God . Emergency evacuation required . Repeat , emergency evacuation required . Mrs. F , we 're down here ! Energy levels approaching critical mass . That 's a recording . Yeah . Emergency evacuation required . That 's the most I 've ever heard her say . I know . Well , this is a whole other code level . It 's going to take me a few minutes . I 'm sorry . You know what ? What ? You know what ? Step aside . Just stand over there . What are you ... Okay , that was flat-out awesome . Pete , what are you doing , man ? Wait , wait , wait , wait . Stop , stop , stop . We gotta go . The circle . I think it 's there for a reason , right ? Pete , what you doing ? Nothing . He 's looking at a typewriter . It 's not just any typewriter . It 's Sylvia Plath 's . She wrote this poem called Ennui , and ultimately , she took her own life and ... Myka , I spend some serious time in the bell jar . I know who Sylvia Plath is . Right . What 's that thing doing to him ? It 's sucking the life out of him . We have to get him out of the containment field . Pete . Pete , can you come here ? Why ? What 's the point ? What do we do ? There 's no time . Okay , you , go to the Gooery , get it online . I 'll stay here and deal with this . Like , just on my own , or ... Yeah . Claudia , you know this Warehouse , okay ? I trust you . Right . Yeah . No , I 'll just ... Yeah , I 'll do it then . Go . Get going . Tick-tock . I have a few more questions . Do you ? Really ? Yeah , I have a few of my own . Arthur , don 't do anything foolish . This exercise is a pointless and insulting waste of time . I asked you not to do this . If MacPherson is out there ... What ? Lf ? Lf ? I have a wound right here , right here , in my shoulder that should prove it . He 's out there . He 's out there , and he 's planning something far worse than any of you can imagine . What are you doing about it ? What are you doing ? You 're tying my hands . You leave us no choice . You say MacPherson is a threat , and you use that to justify violating Warehouse protocol time and time again . Pretty soon , you 're going to be making up your own rules just to sanction your actions . Does this sound familiar , Agent Nielsen ? Huh ? Sound like someone we both knew ? Mr. Valda , he knows the rules . He knows that I 'm forced to follow them , don 't you see that ? And if I 'm going to take MacPherson , and I am , then rules have to be broken . That 's the only thing that 'll work . You know what 's not going to work ? Reining in the one person that can stop him before it 's too late . Look at all of you . You know , you 're not out in the field . You 're here , hiding in plain sight . What are you doing ? You 're judging me , you 're judging my methods because you 're afraid of him . Tell me I 'm wrong . Arthur . No , no , no , no , no . Mr. Valda , look at me . You tell me right to my face , tell me I 'm wrong . Yeah , well , either fire me or kill me . Or let me do my job . Better make a decision , and you better make it fast before he makes it for you . I believe the ball is in your court . Okay , Pete , we 're running out of time here , so ... Okay , look , what I 'm going to do , I 'm going to take off my belt . All right ? I 'm going to throw it to you , you grab it and I 'll pull you out of there , okay , Pete ? Whatever . Okay , grab the belt . Pete , grab the belt . Pete , grab it . Grab the belt . Okay . You 're a rabbit , right ? Pete , you 're not a tortoise , so win . Win the race . Just grab it . Win , lose , what 's the diff ? Okay . Warehouse , give me something . Give me something . Thank you . Okay , Pete . You again ! You okay ? Yeah . What was that ? Okay , listen , we 're running out of time . The Warehouse is about to explode . Okay , so just come on . Oh , boy . Critical mass in five minutes . Critical mass in five minutes . Really ? Cliche , much ? Yeah . Gross . Well , it 's not so bad . Kind of smells like chicken . Critical mass in four minutes . Are you okay ? I 'm okay . I 'm just a little drained , that 's all . You go . Go ahead . I 'll catch up . Are you sure ? Yeah , yeah . You go . Okay . Go . Myka . Yeah ? Thank you . Okay , ugly , I 'm just going to pull you out . This is slippery . Okay , the gloves are coming off . Yeah . Okay . Now I want Italian food . No . Not the plan . Nope . Critical mass in three minutes . Shut up . Claudia ? Myka ! Hey , I know it looks like I 'm having a bunch of fun , but help . Almost there . No , no , no , don 't touch . Way too sticky . No point in us both getting ground up . Okay , pull . What is this stuff ? If I remember properly , it 's hours of fun for the whole family . All right . No , they lied . It 's not even minutes of fun , really . Where 's Pete ? Still bored out of his mind ? No , he 'll be here in a minute . Just keep pulling . Critical mass in two minutes . Mind if I yell ? I 'm going to yell . Pete ! Pete , help ! Pete . Chicks . Pete . Pete , you have to find something to cut this stuff . " Stuff " ? You don 't mean our arms , right ? No . Don 't touch it . - It 's sticky . MRS. - Attention , Warehouse agents , energy levels are now at omega levels . Critical mass in one minute . We 're boned . How much time did she just say ? Fifty seconds . See , see ? Even on tape , she still creeps up . Please ! Just please go find something . Okay , okay . Wait . My tool belt . What ? Right there . Get the snow globe . Okay . I got it . Hey , hey , hey . Use it to freeze the gears . Pete . Okay , okay . I got an idea . Hold on . Hold on , hold on . All right . 30 seconds . You guys gotta pull really hard . Yes . You ready ? Now . Attention , Warehouse agents , emergency abated . Nice work . Thank you . God . How do you do that ? That was quite a performance . Sounded better in my head . So am I fired ? Worse . They want you to stay . Bering and Lattimer are not the best agents we 've ever had . You are . They said that ? It was said . And they were smart enough to believe me . Oh . Thanks . Simply the facts . What about MacPherson ? Good hunting . Try not to get yourself killed . No , no , no . Don 't try to be all friendly with me now . Um ... Hey , Myka ? Yeah ? I just wanted to say thanks for , you know , trusting me before . Claudia , I ... I know what it 's like to be your age and have no one believe in you . Yeah . You 're good . No , you 're really good . You 'll be fine . Thanks . Hey , you know , if you 're not busy later , maybe you could show me how to do that Kick thing . 'Cause , like , I tried it on a light switch and I think I broke my toe . And I know I broke the light switch . That would be fun , you know , and maybe you could teach me how to hack into the ... The grid ? Yeah . You want to hack the grid ? I want to hack the grid . Okay . Yeah , I 'm down . Okay , so I cleaned up the last of the mess . You know , I bet Artie won 't even notice . Won 't notice what ? Your welcome-back surprise party . Surprise ! You look surprised . Doesn 't he look surprised ? Tell me . The zip line crashed and there were these dodgeballs . Some glob got in the Gooery gears . And then we went to Leena 's BB ... We went to the Dark Vault and I was standing ... There was a thunderstorm brewing above the Warehouse . She came over and pushed me . In the Dark Vault ... I cut my arm . We fixed it . We fixed everything . But it 's fixed . Good as new . It 's all ... Totally . Fixed . How long did you have before the Warehouse was going to explode ? Under a minute . More like 30 seconds . That 's lucky . I once got there with 17 . And her voice gets really annoying when she 's counting down seconds one at a time . You didn 't lose that thing I had made for you , did you ? That ... Oh , no . Great . That 's good . It survived . Yay ! Wait , are we not in trouble ? You guys had it under control , right ? That we did , amigo . That we did . All right . I don 't know about you guys , but I 'm starving . Who wants Mexican ? Uh , I do . Need tacos stat . Artie ? No , I had pie . Well , I almost had pie . But go , go , go , enjoy yourselves . Enjoy yourselves . Now I want pie . You always want pie . Who doesn 't want pie ? Maybe just bring me one taco . Whatever . And rest up because you are going to need it .

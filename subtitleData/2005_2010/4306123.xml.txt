 With this mark , we dedicate Nicholas Stephen Tyrol to the service of Ares and Apollo . May he prove worthy of their blessings and those of mighty Zeus . So say we all . ALL : So say we all . He 's wet again . Oh , here , give him to me . I 'll get him . No , it 's okay . It 's my turn . Thanks , sweetie . Chief . One sec . What 's up ? What the hell is that ? I joined New Caprica Police . You 're gonna work for the toasters after they killed Nora ? Some motherfrakker obviously told them we were hiding weapons in here . If I join them , maybe I can find out who . It 's pretty dangerous . Welcome back to the fight . Thanks , Chief . Hey , Duck . Be careful . Yeah . Hey , Chief ? They know that we got more people onboard . It 's time for a major hit on the skin jobs . Anders found us a source for ammonium nitrate . TIGH : Good . We 'll need to find a place to turn it into explosives . I was thinking under the grain storage tent . That 's right across from the hospital . If we frak up and that stuff explodes , those patients ... The patients will have to take their chances . Right . Okay . Let me go check the perimeter . I thought you quit . What frakking difference does it make now ? Take it easy , bro . Yeah . Easy .

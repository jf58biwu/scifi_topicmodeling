Also called Roofies or run-trip-and-fall . The date rape drug . What about these ? - Pressure marks ? - Yep . This kid may have been gettin 'busy , but he got more than he deserved .

I 've helped ' em do it . Not on this case . You have our word . Found this in Matt 's knapsack . Looks like gibberish , but ... This isn 't random . It 's a code . A substitution cipher . It would help if there was a lookup table or a codebook . These look like transactions . Could matt have been dealing ? 2 days ago , I would have said no way , but now ... We need access to your place . We have to find that codebook . Yeah , I 'll get you a key . We 're staying at my sister-in-law 's . Irene just can 't stay at home . It uses " H " more than any other letter . Probably a substitute for " E " , the most common letter . So if the substitution was 3 letters down , then these 2 letters ... Would T.L. ring any bells ? Yeah . His friend . Tommy langer . Lucky guess . Matt was special . Once in a blue moon , you get a student like that . When was the last time you spoke to him ? Last week , in my life drawing class . He was worried about college . His phone records show that he called your house the day he died . Probably to speak to my husband . He 's the track coach here . We heard matt quit the team . Any idea why ? Paul and I try to leave work at work . Do you know anyone here who might want to hurt matt ? Are you sure it wasn 't an accident ? Kids do experiment .

And today , I followed her here . She had to come up on the service elevator . They thought she was a maid . Tell him . Is that all that you want for yourself , lily ? Where are we going ?

You 're watching too much tv . He 's like family . - I 'm calling the cops . - Sweetheart , he is a cop . My fault . We went to enoteco for gelato . The line was endless . How you doing ? You must be hallie . I 'm John Amsterdam . Omar 's told me a lot about you . Like what ? That you never cried as a baby . She was like a little porcupine . Still is . So don 't get too close . It 's late . I have to get corey to bed . See you , corey . Remember . Remember what ? My babysitter , he can 't die . Come on . You 're in a world of pain , Tommy . We got you on burg 2 , possession of a controlled substance , - possession of burglar 's tools . - Matt gave me a key . We 'll check that out with him . Wait a second . We can 't . He 's dead . Murder 2 . You 're trippin ' . I wasn 't anywhe near matt 's place on saturday night . Really ? We found this earring in matt 's bed . How 'd you lose it , Tommy ? During sex ? You boys have a lovers quarrel ? You don 't think I 'm straight ? Think I can prove it to you . Yeah . You wouldn 't last the night . We deciphered your little code . You 're going down for this . My father gets here , and I 'll be out in a minute . On a murder charge ? You can forget bail . Daddy can 't help you now . Only we can . OK . We sold a little blow . Matt needed the money . He couldn 't make it on scholarship alone . - You ever deal roofies ? - That 's for sleazebags . Your notes showed you owed your supplier large . What happened ? - I asked him to borrow some product . - But he said no , so you got into it . He was alive when I left . I swear . Ask marika soloway . - She was there ? - They were getting back together . I left before she did . You ever sail , Tommy ? You good with knots ? I get seasick . Hello , George . I want you to show miss Brown to my table when she arrives . This arrived for you , sir . " My darling , my father was right . " I was living in a wonderland . But this is reality . " I can 't see you anymore . " Please don 't call me or try to contact me , " and please don 't hate me . Lily . " Oh , detectives , this is my husband paul cleary . He was matt 's coach . - We 'd like to speak with you later . - Whatever I can do . I can 't do this now . I 'm speaking at the service . We can always go downtown . I hate this school . Tommy langer . He 's such a loser . Did you see him at Matt 's that day ? - The truth , Marika . - They had a fight , OK ? Over drugs ? Why 'd you lie before ? My family , they 're like beyond wasp . They will disown me when they find out I was seeing him . - You got back together ? - That day . - He was alive when I left . - And we believe that why ? You don 't believe me ? Stay for the service . But what made matt special wasn 't the 4 : 25 mile he ran . The race he was really interested in was the human race . Dray is a family . And it 's lost one of its own . Down , down , down into the darkness of the grave , gently they go , the beautiful , the tender , the kind . Quietly they go . The intelligent , the witty , the brave . You are all such hypocrites . Where were you when he needed you ? " Dray is a family " ? Please . Matt had to deal drugs just to keep up . Coach 's words are nice , now . But why did he kick matt off the track team ? And the teacher he went to for help , mrs . Cleary , well , here 's how that bitch was helping . You see ? We all killed Matt . Ain 't life grand ? Marika said she and matt had the same kind of cell phone . When she left his place , she took the wrong one . The pictures were on it . Well , at least now we know who the killer is . Everyone . Are you here to arreste ? Matt was 17 . You beat the law by a year . Lucky me . Want to tell me what happened ? We fell in love . Did your husband know ? He found some emails . That 's why he kicked Matt off the team . He was furious . Understandably . Where was your husband that night ? He was at the movies . - You know which one ? - No . You think what I did was wrong . I 'm not a judge . Everybody else is . Society makes these distinctions between right and wrong , but ... the heart doesn 't . It feels what it wants to feel . You like to sail . I used to . So after you found out about the affair , you confronted Matt ? You have to understand that I gave this kid everything . He had talent , but no technique . He could have been major . I don 't know ... a jim ryun . And he pays me back by sleeping with my wife . I wanted to kill him . So did you ? - Where were you that night ? - To the movies . - Alone ? - I had some thinking to do . Anyone see you there ? - I don 't know . - What movie ? I didn 't kill that boy . What movie ? Dray school . May I help you ? It 's the home secretary , and we 're doing a background check on hannah cleary . - I know she taught there . - But I 'm not at liberty to say ... Of course . Silly of me . How is the old school ? God , I miss it . - It never changes . That 's its charm . - Quite . - The prince and i were talking of that . - The prince ? Yes . We went to trinity together . A misunderstood man . I really shouldn 't , but the word was that mrs . Cleary was inappropriate with a student , a sixth-former , then she left . It was all very hush-hush . You 're doing your country a service . Well , she was a fisherman 's daughter . What can you expect ? Guess what we found on cleary 's laptop ? He 's been visiting kinky websites . One has photos of sexual asphyxiation . He didn 't do it . We found a bottle of rohypnol in his locker . - Of course . - You think he 's being set up ? I think the heart doesn 't distinguish - between right and wrong . - Is that a yes ? Because the lieutenant wants us to lean on him really hard . We 're losing him . - What 's the story ? - Looks like an O. D. Guy offed himself . - Wife came home and found him . - Sure it wasn 't accidental ? He left this . A suicide note . - And more . - Yeah , I know . A confession . I just hear from the Q-doc , it 's gone take a while , but at first look , they take another ledger . Whatever Q-doc says ... You know I hate that . What ? When I think you know something , but you won 't tell me what you know . This is the sound of me hanging up . See these " T " ? Too regular , too perfect . Look at this , 36 . This little tag at the second " o " in honor . It 's like the writer started to write a " U. " Maybe out of habit , maybe because she was used to spelling it the british way . It 's not bad work . For an art teacher from brighton . But I could do better . At least uncle sam wants me . Name ... Johann Van Der Zee . Date of birth ... june 1 1607 Place of birth ... Amsterdam , Holland . So that 's the end of the story , 29 ? You know , lily did me a favor . She got me to join the army . Maybe if i 'm lucky , I 'll get killed . I don 't understand . Why did you read me my rights ? A formality . We just have a few questions . Please sit down . It has been a hellish week . I 'm sure you understand . Oh , I understand . I thought you 'd like to take a look at this . I 've already read the suicide note . Of course , but this is a note we found in your husband 's office . I really think you should read it . - Is it a joke ? - That would make you the punchline . - He haven 't written this ! - It 's his handwriting . - It 's a lie . - Is it ? Which part , hannah ? Where it says that paul wanted to set the record straight in case something happened to him ? Or where it says that you killed Matt because you were crazy with jealousy . - I don 't have to listen to this ! - And Matt called you that day , told you he was getting back with marika . That you flipped out , drove to matt 's place , spiked his drink , tied his hands with a knot only a fisherman 's daughter would use . Now which part ? Which part is the lie ? I gave Matt everything , and he threw it all away . And you overdosed your husband and forged his confession . Rohypnol 's legal in england , isn 't it ? Paul figured it out . I had no choice . The way I felt about matt ... You will never know that kind of love . I hope not . - What are you doing ? - I never said paul wrote the letter . I only said it looked like his handwriting . Just wanted to let you know we moved back into our place . Irene feels like she can sleep there again . - That 's good . - Yeah . It 's a start . You kept your promise . You never liked to practice . My hands were too small . You ever see Oscar Peterson 's hands ? Ham hocks . Thought you should have this . There 's an inscription to your mother . It 'll tell you what you need to know . How is he ? 10 fingers , 10 toes . We 're just washing him up . You all alone , honey ? We need the father 's name . John York . Took 3 trains to get here . Did I miss it ? I never thought I 'd see you again . How did you know ? Well , let 's just say my secretary takes an unusual interest in my personal life . That 's why you sent me the letter . I found out that day . - I didn 't see another way ... - No , that 's the past . - How 's the baby ? - Beautiful . In a scrunched up kind of way . It 's for you . Figured you 'd need some sleep . I loved your mother , omar . She was fierce , brave . What ? How 'd you find this ? A lot of firemen come in here , buy a few drinks . You 'd be surprised what you could learn . You had the ambulance number wrong . It was 7-8-9 . The 8 looked like a 3 . She 's an E. R. Doc at st . Francis . Her name is sara dillane . Maybe you ought to go find her . Yeah . See you later . There was a boy ... A very strange , enchanted boy ... Give the man his son . They say he wandered very far ... very far ... So what are we going to call our golden boy ? How about after our favorite poet ? That 's perfect . It means " he who speaks . " Omar . That 's a good name . This he said ... to me ... The greatest thing ... you 'll ever learn ... is just to love ... and be loved ... in return . Transcript : sub-way Synchronisation : dmbmh

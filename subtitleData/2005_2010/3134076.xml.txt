 Come to my family again , and you and I are at war . When can we bring him in ? How soon ? We can 't just pull him off the streets . I 'm sorry , I 'm so sorry , I thought you were Tom . Daddy ! You can be anything you want to be ... Mr Hyde . Jekyll and Hyde . The comparison has occured to me , but this is fiction . Any idea who might be bribing us , Dr Jackman ? Or who might be following you in the black van ? He 's got a knife . Minimum necessary force , you understand me ? Ok , a quick half , then ! I 've gotta go home and change . Unscheduled change , he 's coming . What triggered it this time ? You might at least have had the decency to be having an affair . I 'm not sure how strong he is . Strength isn 't usually a variable . - Sorry ? - In cases like this . There aren 't any cases like this . Good luck , Ms Reimer . Good night , Dr Jackman . Who are you ? We were just talking a moment ago . That wasn 't me . Who are you ? Nice ! But it 's not your usual perfume , there 's another one underneath . Special scent for today , then ? For him ? For me ? The woman sitting opposite you is Katherine Reimer . She 's a psychiatric nurse ... with experience in ... related areas . It 's raining , it 's pouring , Jackman is ... boring . He was talking about me . I 'm Katherine Reimer . Is he doing you ? Can I ? Then what are you for ? I 'm your new nanny . Oh , Mary Poppins ! I love her ! I could eat Mary Poppins . I 'm here to work for both of you , if you approve , of course . You have a vote , too . What , we 're getting in a helpline ? I have references if you want to see them and I can start immediately if that suits . If you have any questions , I 'll be happy to answer them . Am I interviewing you ? Yes . Why do you want this job , Miss Poppins ? It 's interesting . Clearly unique , in fact . Why is it unique ? When I spoke to Dr Jackman , I assumed it was just a simple case of split personality . But there 's a physical change , too , isn 't there ? You 've got darker hair . Different hairline . Your eyes are darker too , very dark . Hard to tell , you 're sitting down ... but I 'd say you 're what , a couple of inches taller ? A few pounds lighter , too ? That 's gotta be handy . And you 've got a slightly different jawline . Next question . Why did you lie to me ? I 'm sorry ? When I asked you why you wanted the job , why did you lie ? - I 'm sorry , I didn 't lie ... - Rule one ! Don 't ever lie to me ! I can smell lies . Thing is , darling , I don 't really care why you want the job . Don 't mind if you 've got secrets or if you don 't answer my questions . Don 't answer many questions myself . But don 't ... Don 't ever lie to me . Now ... Why do you really want this job ? Don 't open your mouth unless you 're telling me the truth . Good girl . Good girl , Mary Poppins , you 're learning . - Love a girl with secrets . - Next question . - Can you release me from this chair ? - I can , yes . - Are you going to ? - Do I have a job ? - Release me from the chair . - What happens if I don 't ? Find out . Not good enough . Gonna need some assurances . The lights are on , so are the cameras . You 're perfectly safe if the lights are on and Daddy can see me . So here 's the deal . Here 's the job . As long as the lights and cameras are on , you 're safe . Lights out you 're dinner . What d 'you think ? I think you must have quite an appetite . Gonna watch telly for a while before I go out . There 's beers in the fridge . Bring several . Welcome to the company , Mary Poppins . Subtitles : Nathbot How many times ? How many bloody times ? You feel an unscheduled change coming , you tell me where I am ! She left , sir . Fine . Good . Well , can I have the bill , please ? You 've already paid . Happen to know where I parked ? You could 've told me I was seeing someone . - Lose your keys again ? - I don 't know where he leaves ' em . So , who is she ? He 's left-handed . Why can 't either of you check the other pocket ? Who is she ? I keep your secrets , I keep his too . I know he sees lots of women . " Sees " is a nice word . But I need know if he 's got anything close to a relationship . What qualifies this one as a relationship ? Dinner , no sex . Have you been drinking ? Don 't tell me you took the car . He drank , he took the car . Why am I getting the look ? How was your driving ? Expressive . I gave you a Breathalizer . You must always check , you don 't know where you 've been ! Ta . The age-old family curse is enough , no need to lose your driving license too . - Is this the tea I like ? - It 's always the same tea . Tastes like the other one . There isn 't another one . It 's always the same tea . I wasn 't due this evening . I owe him the time . Tell him he can have it whenever he wants , but not tomorrow . I 'll tell him . Hyde . Can 't believe he 's calling himself Hyde now . - He read the book , he like it . - Liked it ? Read it ? Made him laugh . So ... What 's she like ? Have you met her ? Has he brought her home to Mummy ? That information is off-limits , Dr Jackman . I could listen to the audio logs . He asked for three hours off-the-record , which I granted . As you can see from the GPS , he didn 't change location during that time . All within the terms of your agreement . He 's entitled to a private life . I 'm dating someone and I 'm not allowed to know about it ? - You didn 't tell me he was married . - I 'm married ! And he 's dating someone ! He 's met my wife , played with my kids , I can 't even get equal rights with myself ! He saw your family once and he 's kept away from them ever since . He made a promise and he 's keeping it . Only because I kept him in the chair for a week . He does get angry , doesn 't he ? - Definitely tastes like the other tea . - There 's only one tea . Excuse me . No , you 're at it , but it 's fine . I told you , there 'll be no aftereffects , it 's low dosed . It causes amnesia . He won 't remember a thing since he got back here . Later . It causes amnesia . He won 't remember a thing since he got back here . I still don 't understand why you had to drug him . Because I 've got every key in the flat except one . Still trying to take down the security . It 's like Big Brother in here . It 's got too many safeguards . I 'm gonna have to cut the power . - Is that safe ? - Of course it 's not safe . The dose I gave him won 't keep under for long , and I don 't know who he 'll be when he wakes up . So no offence . You win . I believe you . Your letter was in the box . Did you hear me ? I believe you . Hello , Katherine . Mr Hyde ? Jackman 's in bed now . Hyde is awake . And you 're dead now . You knocked him out , didn 't you ? Silly little Katherine , silly little dead girl ! When the doctor is out , I 'm in . Oh , Katherine ! Alone at last ! Mr Hyde , you don 't play these games , not with me ! You 've always had more sens . You know what I 've got now ? You . I 've also got the main fuse . Yep , took your keys . Yep , took my keys too . Well , look at here , Katherine . Everything you need for the perfect night in . A beautiful woman , a locked door and soundproofing . - You won 't hurt me . - I 'll eat you ! You know the rules . You hurt me or anyone , he turns himself in . You turned off the cameras . Anything happens to me , you think he won 't know it was you ? You think he won 't guess ? You 're guessing . - I know how he thinks . - I am how he thinks ! Then you 've got a problem because you like me ! Bet your life ? Are you messing with me , Mr Hyde ? Ten ... What ? Nine ... What is this , what 're you doing ? Eight ... Seven ... What are you doing ? Six ... Five ... Four ... Three ... Two ... Come to Daddy ! She 's running , she 's crying She 's turned out the lights and she 's dying If I tell you who I am , you won 't kill me . Are you listening ? If I tell you who I am and who sent me here , we turn the lights back and the cameras , you won 't hurt me . Go on , then . Try me , ask me who sent me here . Feeling a bit weird . I don 't really remember getting home last night . He hasn 't been taking drugs again , has he ? I don 't think so . You okay ? Yeah , sure . What 's wrong ? Sorry . Jumpy today . It 's nothing . Time of the month ? A bit rich , coming from the wolf-man . See you later . See you . Daddy ! Uncle Billy ! Hello , boys . Where has Uncle Billy gone ? Sorry , no Uncle Billy . He says he 'll come another day . But I saw him , he was sitting right next to you . No , you didn 't ! I did , I saw him ! He 's not there , stupid ! I saw him ! Come on , boys . On you go . Tom ! Peter . What 're you doing here ? I just thought I 'd ... drop by . What , socially ? What 's wrong with that ? You . Heard there was a zoo trip in the offing , thought I might pop along , help you with the boys . Is that alright ? Extra pair of hands , didn 't think you 'd mind . Well , that 's settled then . Come on , you two , let 's get you strapped in ! Am I being set up for a man-to-man ? Well , you don 't have them with me anymore ... Peter at a zoo ? He 's wearing a suit ! Who wears a suit to the zoo ? Have a good time . Sorry . Rules of estrangement . Do we kiss now ? I 've forgotten . I 'll have ' em back by 6pm . Ok , no kissing . Filed . Eddie , wipe your nose . Why ? It 's running . But I 'm eating ! And not just food . Wipe your nose . Is it always like this ? The ... eating ? Sorry , it wasn 't on purpose . No , no , just ... sharing your food . Will you for God 's sake wipe your nose ? What 's wrong ? Eddie . What 's wrong ? You shouted at him . No , I didn 't ! Of course I didn 't , I didn 't shout at anyone . Something wrong ? So , since when have you been an animal lover ? I hunt every summer . That 's not exactly loving them , is it ? That 's more shooting them . Well , it 's a ... brief relationship . Alright , at you come . Harry , you go with Uncle Peter , hold his hand . Eddie , come with me . Come on , Harry . Careful ... Good boy . What 's wrong ? Nothing . Probably nothing . Just being paranoid . Right you lot , let 's go to the zoo . What 's " paranoid " ? It 's when you think everyone 's out to get you . What 's wrong with it ? Meat wasn 't fresh . No excuse for that in a zoo , isn 't there ? Daddy , Eddie 's nose is running ! Eddie , not your jumper , use a tissue . In your pocket , there 's a tissue . Which child ? How about the snotty one ? Eddie , use the tissue ! If you had to lose a kid , I guess you 'd choose the snotty one . Let 's make this work , people . Our last , best chance for a long time , according to our man on the inside . I 'm on my way . But listen , I 'm not sure about any of this anymore . It 's too late now , Katherine . I 'm at the café . It 's like a leaky tap , your nose . D 'you know that ? Like a leaky tap . I 'm gonna have to send you back to the factory and get it mended . Yeah , the man can take him back , won 't he Daddy , to the factory ! Use the tissue , ok ? Not your coat . But I don 't want to go to the factory ! No , you 're not going to the factory . There is no factory . I 'm joking , ok ? Big silly Daddy joke . So , you walk out on your wife , now there 's an Uncle Billy . Good looking young man , I hear . You don 't think ... - Claire doesn 't think ... - Claire thinks he 's actually a relative . - People have relatives . - You don 't . Eddie , stop it ! Daddy ! Is that yours or mine ? What ? It 's mine , hand on . Hello , who is this ? Dr Jackman , it 's me . - Katherine ? - Hyde 's awake . I 'm sorry ? He 's awake , Hyde , in your head , right now . What are you talking about ? Can we talk ? Are you alone ? I 'm at the zoo , I 'm with my kids . Go somewhere we can talk . I 'm sorry , I have to take this call . - You keep an eye on the boys ? - Yeah , sure . Are you alone ? I 'm at the zoo , Katherine . What d 'you mean , he 's awake ? He can 't be if I am . That 's not what you thought at the station when you shouted at Eddie . You thought it might 've been Hyde then , didn 't you ? How do you know about that ? When you arrived at the house , Eddie thought he saw Hyde on the passenger seat , remember ? It could 've been some kind of psychic impression . What d 'you think ? Sensitive child ? How do you know about that ? He 's awake , Hyde is awake , in your head , right now ! He can 't be . He 's awake . Look at your phone ! - My phone ? - Look at it ! It 's not connected . So the question is , Dr Jackman , how can I be phoning you if your phone isn 't connected ? How is that physically possible ? How is that possible , Dr Jackman ? How is that possible ... Daddy ? How can you be phoning me ? Jesus , I 'm not phoning you , I 'm in your head ! Keep the phone on your ear , or people will think we 're schizo . What , schizo , d 'you think ? I 've just taken a call from my own head ! Why aren 't you asleep ? There 's something in our bloodstream keeping me awake . Something new . A drug . - Tickles . - You can feel your blood ? You can 't do that ? - Who drugged us ? - That 's not why I called . - You had a reason ? - I 'm your dark side , it 's not like we chat . What was that ? Pulled it from your memory . Who are those guys ? Which guys ? Those guys . - How do you do that ? - You can 't do that ? They 're following me . Not you . - Eddie ! - Yeah , cause remember ? I don 't wanna go to the factory ! I don 't wanna go to the factory ! What is this ? What 's happening ? Daddy ! Daddy ! Stop doing his voice , stop it ! I have stopped . Daddy ! Daddy ! Eddie ? Daddy ! Stay there . Don 't move . My son 's in there ! My son 's in there with the lions , you 've gotta get him out ! My son 's in there ! Please , I need your help ! My son 's in there ! What are you doing ? Who are you ? What do you want ? What do you want ? Me . They want me . Ok , take me . Take him ! Take Hyde , whatever you want , just get my son out of there ! At least , they took the snotty one . That shows consideration . It 's okay , son ! God , Eddie ! Daddy ! He 's got in ! - Has he changed ? - I don 't know . I take total responsability for any mistakes today , which means I fire everybody ! You said this would work . Has he changed ? What the hell was that ? Jesus . Oh , my God . Shit . Going out on a limb here , he 's changed . What 's he doing ? He just threw a lion over the wall . Anything he likes . Gave it up for a ballsy song choice . - There 's a note . - What ? On the lion , there 's a note . Well ? - What ? - Get the note from the lion ! - It 's for you . - What , me ? " Dear Benjamin , meet me in the lion 's den . " He can 't be serious . He just sent a note with a dead lion . How much more freakin ' serious do you get ? " PS : alone . " I 've got several clear lines of sight . I 'll get my best shots on it . Don 't kill him . Or me . In that order . Clean up the van ! In the jungle , the mighty jungle The lion sleeps tonight In the jungle , the quite jungle The lion sleeps tonight Mr Hyde ! Ever killed anyone , Benjamin ? Not personally , I have people . You 're missing out . It 's like sex , only there 's a winner . Thought you might be here somwhere . Come in . You know what ? I 'm doing fine , just here . You nervous , Benjamin ? Uh ? Not nervous , no ! I 'm just a little lion-aware . Not nice to turn down someone 's hospitality , Benjamin . I 've got my pride . You can control them ? They 're just lions ! Can 't you ? Kid seems a little freaked . Yeah , what can you do ? Somebody tried to feed him to a lion . Yeah , sorry about that . Just an experiment . A what ? We wanted to precipitate the change . According to our understanding , placing your child in danger , especially the primal kind of danger , the threat of a savage beast , would create exactly the right chemical conditions to bring us ... Well you . Why should I care if the kid 's in danger ? Have you seen his nose ? Well , you did just save his life . I killed a lion . There 's a difference . You know what ? You don 't have to care about him . Tom Jackman cares . So you came . So , you took over a whole zoo for an experiment . It 's our zoo . What ? We didn 't have to take it out , it 's ours . Since when ? This morning . Tom Jackman bought tickets , we bought the zoo . What , you thought we 'd send in a SWAT team ? Money . It 's the new war . That 's who you 're talking to . That 's what we can do . Which of your guys put my son in here ? Why do you wanna know ? I don 't , Tom Jackman does . He 's awake . I can feel him . Tickles . Sorry , can 't give you that information . Ok , I 'm getting the big guy I put through the window , what 's his name ? You mentioned his name ... Christopher ! That 's amazing . What you can do . All of it , amazing . Look at you ! The most powerful creature on the planet , that 's what I 'm looking at . The fastest , the smartest , the best . And you 're British , so it 's even funny . We have waited and you have come ! Fourty years ago , a child , a baby , was left in a railway station . Six months old . But we knew who he was . Who he had to be . And we have cared for Tom Jackman ever since . More than cared . Controlled every step of his life . Waiting for you to emerge . And here you stand ! Mr Hyde , reborn ! The second coming ! With balls ! Who left me at the station ? - Who knows ? - You don 't . We know more about Dr Jekyll 's experiment and your creation than anyone else alive . We could help you ... You don 't know who left me at the station ! Let 's find out together . Work with us . What do you say ? What if I say no ? People don 't say no to us , Mr Hyde . Not even you . Sure , you can kill a lion with your bare hands , that 's cool . But when it comes right down to it , we can buy the freakin ' zoo . Give me an answer , Mr Hyde . We 've got a man down . Mr Lennox , he 's on the roof of the van . Shit ! That 's not me on the roof ! Start up , we 're getting out of here ! Sorry , Christopher . That 's enough zoo for today . My daddy wants a word with you . Wakey-wakey . Dr Jackman ? Who are you ? What 's your name ? Christopher Browning . Christopher Browning . You put my son in a cage with lions , Christopher Browning . Why ? I was ordered to . Why ? - To make you change . - Why ? I don 't know why . One last chance . Why ? - I don 't know . - Don 't lie to me ! Don 't annoy me ! That 's not a good way to go . You 've heard of good cop-bad cop ? This is the movie . I 'm nobody , mate , I 'm nothing . And I don 't know anything . And I 'm not lying . Just please , don 't let him in again , eh ? Forget Hyde . I don 't need Hyde . All I 've got to do , pick up the phone . You tried to kill a child . D 'you wanna spend your life in prison as a child killer ? Think about that . That phone there , all I need . Do you want me to phone the police ? Yeah ! Appelez-les . Vous m 'avez eu , et il y a des témoins . Go and phone ' em ! Turn me in , please . Otherwise ... He 's gonna come back ! For God 's sake , just phone ' em ! Still can 't sleep ? He 's telling you the truth . He 's nothing , just a little man , taking orders . So ? They 've got a lot of little men like him . So many . Coming for your family . Send them a message . What message ? The only message they 'll understand . " Look what happened to the last one . " I can 't do that . Of course you can 't . You 're weak . Just be weak a moment longer . Close your eyes and let me fly . Then I hope you 're strong enough to bury your children . You don 't care about my children ! I love children meat ! Snack size people always leave you wanting more ! I 'll tell you what . You 're the one who doesn 't care , if that man walks out of here . What is that , eh ? I mean , that phone is not even connected . What is it ? Bad news . Hi ! What 's that ? Well , that 's entirely up to you , of course , but I 'd say ... The front of the queue . Oh , my God ! My God ! You 're still shaking . - I 'm fine . - No , you 're not . I 'm getting there - You told him who you work for ? - I had to . What did he say ? - He laughed . - Which saved your life . Did you think he wouldn 't attack you ? I thought we had an understanding . You do , keep the lights on . - I thought we had better than that . - He 's a wild animal . When you care for a wild animal , never forget what you 're dealing with . Or you 'll lose a limb . - Or your life . - It was your idea . - Not turning off the power ! - It 's the only way ... Don 't fall in love with Tom Jackman . I 'm not in love with Dr Jackman . It 's appealing , a man so determined to beat his own demons . But he never can . Hyde is a savage beast . Stronger every day . And Tom Jackman is a man who wakes up every morning wondering what he 's done this time . Are you with Claire ? Jesus , Tom , where are you ? If you 're with Claire , don 't tell her it 's me . Of course I 'm with Claire , where did you go , what happened ? Yes . How 's Eddie ? Confused . Shocked , probably . Doesn 't seem to remember much . He keeps going on about Uncle Billy . For God 's sake , Tom , what happened in there ? Can 't get a word of sense out of anyone at the zoo , and then you go and bloody disappear ! I need to talk to you now . Where are you ? Sherringham Hospital , intensive care . Head for the visiting area . Don 't tell Claire . I 'm on my way . If you hear anything , Peter , anything at all ... You 'll be the first to know . You were asking about Mr Browning ? I 'm afraid you 're gonna have to speak to a doctor . He 's here . Ok , people , let 's move it ! Let 's everybody not screw up ! Sherringham Hospital . What 've you got ? Who owns that ? Do we own that ? NHS . Speaking english ! You were asking about Christopher Browning ? I heard you , with the nurse . Yes , I 'm ... I know him . He 's never gonna walk again , or speak , or eat , except through a straw . Blind in both eyes , deaf in both ears . Almost every bone in his body broken . Who does that to a person ? What kind of man ? You 're his mother , aren 't you ? It was in the tea . You drugged me . You 're working for them ! No , she 's working for me . I 'm not that poor man 's mother , that 's not why I 'm crying . I 'm yours . There 's a team on the way . We 'll have him here in an hour . I 'll meet them there . Good work , Mr Syme . You 're welcome . The horror 's in , then ? No , he knows we 're coming after him now . Can 't leave him out on the loose . No more kids and lions . We 're done being nice . So ... You 're my mother . I 'm the nearest thing you 've got . What does that mean ? It means I left you in a railway station fourty years ago , with a letter and a photograph . What about my father ? He died many years ago . What did he die of ? Was he like me ? Did he have what I have ? Is that what killed him ? Either way , it 's a long story . Did you tell Hyde ? I didn 't tell Hyde much of anything . I know what he is . I just wanted to meet both my boys . I don 't think he was interested in me anyway , you know your brother . Anything he can 't screw or eat ... Why did Katherine drug me ? You advertised for someone to work for you . I made sure you found someone you could trust . But once she met you , she didn 't trust me . Wanted proof I was who I said I was . But you keep your secrets so close , drugging you was the only way she could get to them . We didn 't know there 'd be side effects . I 'm sorry . I think she 's a little bit in love with you , but I 'm sure you know that . I let him loose today . On that man . Hyde whispered in my ear ... and I let him tear a man apart . That 's how Hyde works . He reduces you piece by piece . All the easy options . He 's evil , that 's what evil does . The nearest thing that I 've got to a mother ... What does that mean ? It 's complicated . I think you 're my mother or you 're not , it 's simple . You are a direct descendent of Dr Henry Jekyll of Edimburgh , correct ? And yet , Dr Henry Jekyll had no family , correct ? Then how can anything be simple ? I need to know where I came from ! Of course you do . Are you going to tell me ? That 's why I 'm here . Dr Jackman ! Did you tell anyone where you were ? No ... Well , a friend . - Who ? - Peter Syme . Peter Syme isn 't your friend , he 's your keeper . You 've got to go now . If they 've decided to pull you in , you 've got to disappear . Who 's going to pull me in ? - I 'll delay them . - How ? Don 't go home , don 't contact anyone . Just for God 's sake , please disappear . What about Hyde , how do I control him ? You can 't . Excuse me , who are you ? - Official business . - Who 's " official business " ? Sorry boys , you just missed him . Come on , Mr Syme , you must have seen photographs of me . Have I really aged that much ? Dear God ! I 've been told there 's no one I can trust , but I 've decided to trust you . Dr Jackman ? There 's a woman called Katherine , she 'll contact you . Help her . Dr Jackman , where are you ? Gone away . That was him ! Phone him back ! I 'm phoning him back . Mrs Jackman ? Good morning . They 'll be down to talk to you in five minutes . Do you want a coffee or anything ? No coffee . Tell them five minutes will be fine . And what 's going to happen to me ? The truth , please . He will get stronger , you will get weaker . It 's always the same , every Jekyll , every Hyde . Not this time . I 'll fight him . - You can 't . - I won 't ever stop fighting him . Then he will kill you . Then , I won 't die . How 's Mum this morning ? No trouble . Didn 't even want coffee . I 'll fight him . - You can 't . - I won 't ever stop fighting him . Then he will kill you . Then , I won 't die . I have a family . I have a wife and children . I won 't die . I don 't have the time . - Nobody in or out ? - Nobody . - But you offered her coffee . - I used the com . Two minutes ago I spoke to her . She was fine . Then where is she ? Nobody in or out , one door ! Where is she , uh ? Shit !

 Yes , chilling ! I 'm so scared of your leftover prop from a Styx video . Oh , please spare my life , Mr. Roboto . Miss me , darling ? What ? No , I just saw you , like , five minutes ago . You have thwarted my robot , my dear Monarch ! But Dr. Dugong has plenty more tricks up his sleeve . You don 't have sleeves . You 're in a seal costume . Dugong ! And it 's not a costume ! - Boys , locate Dr. Manatee . - Dugong ! He 's been on the stupid PA the whole time . There 's a speaker right over my head . It 's so loud . It 's blah , blah blah , blah blah . ... desperate attempt to learn the secrets of love and caring , was chemically fused with a gentle sea cow ! Dr. Sea Lion won 't stop with the third person . Dugong ! A dugong ! Douglas Ong . Dr. Dugong - - Oh , my God , thank you . OK , I know he 's annoying , but you have to get into it . You gotta at least pretend to try . He 's such a weenus . Did you hear that origin story ? " Secrets of love and caring " ? - " Caring " ? - Yeah , that was kinda gay . But I really want you to try to take this seriously . We 've located Dr. Dugong , mum . Good work . Mommy 's little babies . It 's bad enough that they ignore me ... but do you have to call them that ? Man seeks a good time , but he is not a hedonist . He seeks love , he just doesn 't know where to look . He looks under the beds ... of whores and in the hot stem of a crack pipe ... but he should look to nature . Gentle aquatic mammals have all the answers . Your door was locked , so we let ourselves in . Yeah , we got our own key . Well , if it isn 't Dr. Mrs. The Monarch ... the pupa twins , and ... a-and ... Come on , Monarch . What 's the holdup ? OK , OK . Oh , man ! You 're all flesh colored . How much thalidomide did your mom take ? You may have found my inner sanctum , but you are not - - Yeah , yeah , yeah . Can you hold that speech for a second ? - Don 't forget it . - I won 't . One second ! Will you just try to do this right ? This guy 's a chump . You get me in front of Dr. Venture ... and I 'll show you how I dance . We 'll talk about that later . Now , please , do it for me . OK , fine . Go ahead . Oh , oh . You may have found my inner sanctum - - Shut up ! Now give us the key , or the plans or whatever-the-hell you have ! I have a tank full of gentle cuttlefish . Give us the cuttlefish ! Cuttle ... I can 't do this ! Oh , you were so close , sweetie . Just pretend he 's Dr. Venture . Give me that gun . You abandoned me ! You abandoned my hatred ! I-I-I have cuttlefish . Look into my eyes ! ♪ His pernicious steed circles the graves ♪ ♪ Of the damned souls ♪ ♪ Blood morphs into fire ♪ ♪ Demon sword in flames ♪ ♪ Hell lava licks the wounds of my insanity ♪ ♪ My insanity ♪ So ? Hmm , rock band music ? OK , I 'll do the feature . What 's your angle ? You 're incredibly lame . Here 's the angle . The next big thing since Eddy and The Cruisers . My boyband good looks , Dermott 's bizarre anger ... and a robot on drums . Hmm , I like it . It has a science angle . So , what does the band go by ? I like " Lip Glossary . " And I 'm leaning towards " Goat Blood Sacrifice . " Well , there 's your story . We 'll have a readers ' contest . Dean , we 're your only readers . My subscribers number well into the teens ! Right here in " Affection Directions " ... a troubled reader queries - - " I 'm on love with my boss ' wife . " But because my boss is a known killer and private torturer ... " I 'm afraid to say something . " Signed , G. Viceroy . So I reply - - " It 's a slippery slope you ski , Mr. Viceroy . " But yours truly Deany Vee " thinks it 's best to march up to her " and tell her how you feel . " It doesn 't matter that she 's kinda scary ... " and that her Dad is magic . " It 's best to make your noble intentions known . " Complete weenus . I thought it was pretty good advice . I mean , a man can 't live a lie and still be a man ! This Viceroy guy is probably dying inside . Dude , this Viceroy guy is probably fictitious . Or one of you guys . Why would you say that ? I mean , it 's absurd . There 's no proof that it 's one of us . Well , it 's Dean Venture 's fake little newspaper . How many people read it ? Well , yeah . That 's what I meant . Because it sounds like a joke . That 's joking . That 's totally joking talk . Drop it . Hey , the buffoon answered my question . Unbelievable ! OK , OK , check this out . I wrote - - " Dear Deany Vee , I 'm remodeling my bachelor pad . " And everybody knows that Deany Vee lives in the coolest home ever . " Could you please print out a layout of the Venture compound . " Complete with security schematics and access codes ? " " You are in luck , Bare Walls in Baltimore . " Because I plan a whole feature on the Venture compound ... " and a two page spread ... " on Rusty Venture 's amazing Vacuum-boombroom ... " fresh from it 's triumphant showing at the Science Now Conference . " That , plus word jumbles , comics , and coupons ... " all in the next Venture Home News ! " Showing the Vacuum-boombroom . Do you know what that means ? That Venture 's invented an exploding vacuum ? And that he gave it the stupidest name ever ? Close ! It means that Venture is , as we speak ... showing his lame-ass invention ... at the Science Now Conference . Ahh ! This is the first year I won 't be there to piss on his parade ! Dude ! Oh , I mean , Mighty Monarch ! We should do it . - Come on , it would be so sweet . - Can 't . Guild won 't let me arch Venture . Why do you think I 'm hanging out with you guys ? Because we 're super-cool ! Yeah , that 's it . As cool as we are , undeniable . If I had a lady like your wife , I would be with her right now . And I 'd be brushing her hair ... and then we 'd explore our feelings . If you had a lady like my wife ... you would be in an alternate universe where - - where dogs talk and birds have human pets . Wooo- - oh , crap ! You just reminded me . I have to go to my wife 's little post game pow wow . He went arching ? Without us ? Ow ! Ohh ! We don 't get to do anything . I 'm , like , this close to arching the paper boy . Sweetie , you just killed your arch enemy . You killed him . He 's dead . Well , I 'm that good . What can I say ? You 're not an assassin , you 're a villain . The Guild is very touchy ... with cold-blooded murder on day one ! With a fucking cripple that thinks he 's half a sea cow . That guy was lame ! I can 't go from Dr. Venture to that guy . If these are the kind of Protagonists I keep getting ... I 'm gonna quit . Yeah , quit . Mature . You kill every arch enemy you get assigned ... and I keep apologizing to the Guild . Just quit . That 's fair . Now you 're trying to make me out to be the bad guy . Yes ! I 'm trying to make you a bad guy ! We 're both bad guys ! We 're professional bad guys . Ding ! Hello ? ! Yes , please , belittle me in front of my henchmen . It 's a real morale booster . Well , why are we arguing in front of the henchmen anyway ? Because the henchmen are standing here . Are you two gonna get a divorce ? That 's a very pretty costume , Mrs. Monarch . I have a cocoon parked in a tree that is full of guys ... that do nothing but play a video game that uses a little plastic baby guitar ! They have nothing to do since those mean little freaks moved in . I don 't wanna sound prejudice or anything ... but they are super creepy . As long as this is all out in the open ... I have evidence that they pee in the corners of my room . They 're marking my room . You wanna lose some of that belly fat right fast ? Put you on a cold steel diet . Be the last diet you ever go on . Boys , don 't cut anybody . No , go ahead and kill him . Metaphorically ! Do it . The henchmen aren 't being used for anything ! I mean , you and your knife wielding ... miniature psychos seem to do just fine without us ! Come on , Minions . We are not needed here ! - Time ! - 3.23 seconds . Not bad considering your lack of training . Alright , it 's my turn . Here 's the secret . You have to lead H.E.L.P.eR. Duh . Aw , come on ! Your ceiling 's too low for me to do my sweet Gymkata ... hand-spring wheel-kick . OK , ready , set ... Go ! Our drummer wasn 't ready ! I came at him with my chi ... totally focused right here in my upper chest . Plus , if I had on my tabbi boots , I - - Shhh ! - What ? - Somebody 's coming ! Oh , forget it . Just let him in . What is going on in here ? Hey , loser . Changed out of your 1 91 0 banker 's costume ... into your Umpa Lumpa costume for us ? It 's a speed suit . I wear it when I 'm doing science . Dean , putting plastic dinosaurs in water ... till they get huge and all bloated isn 't " doing science . " That hurt , Hank . I expect that kind of sass from Dermott , but not from you . Can you please stop H.E.L.P.eR. from drumming ? ! No , I 'm not even sure how we got him to start . We can 't even get him to play something different . OK , it 's 1 0 : 30 . I 'm gonna clean up the mess in the kitchen , you 're welcome . And then it 's bedtime for all of us . What , are you going through menopause ? Have some fun for once . Yeah , Deano . Lighten up . You are missing the big picture , Hank . If Dad sees that we can handle ourselves without him ... we get more privileges . Scooter rides off the compound ... sleep away astronaut camp , public school . Hank , public school ! We are being tested ! You guys are sad . Why did he decide to leave you here in the first place ? Something about the Conference having " hot desperate women . " And we had a bad run-in ... with the Hot Lava men of Tanga Island . So I can imagine ... how dangerous their women get when they 're desperate . I can 't take it anymore ! I-I gotta blow off some steam or something . Two words , titty bar . I 'm just gonna throw that out there . Totally ! And two more words - - potato skins . I got a better idea . We return to suckle the teat of hate ... that once nourished us like so much butterfly themed Romulus and Remus . So , yes , to the strip club ? No ! We are going to fuck up an empty Venture Compound ! Your wife isn 't gonna like that . Whatever ! When did this happen ? Last thing I remember ... I was planting dynamite under Venture 's baby blue jeep ! That was the best ! And we had that plunger thing you push down . So classic . We need to get an anvil and drop that on him . Sweet ! Or a round bomb ! Oh , the black ones with the fuse ? I love those . But look at my life now . Hatred 's become a job . I had true hatred with Venture . I didn 't have to fake it . That sweet loathing just poured out of me ... whenever I saw his pathetic face . I just - - I just wanted to kick his ass . I wanted to build a machine to kick his ass . I wanted to build an empire ... to house the machine to kick his ass ! Then , by God , let 's go take a dump in his pool ! What 's with the sidecar ? It 's your Queen 's throne . Yeah , just one of the many super-features we worked into the new cocoon . Why don 't you just paint the place pink , while you 're at it . Cool . I rebuilt that throne and never knew it did that . To the Monarchmobile ! This rules ! I 'm gonna take the stairs . OK , Monarch , I 'm gaining serious fucking momentum over here ! Well , use your feet to slow yourself down . I 'm wearing booties ! I can feel every seam on this thing ! It kills ! Ow ! The crown ! Can you pull over please ? I can 't stop ! Aaah ! Ow ! Oh , right on my coccyx . Ow , right on your coccyx . Who put the top up ? You 'll thank me later . It 's gonna rain . Whoa ! What is this , Chitty Chitty Bang Bang ? Who else knew it could do this ? This is driving me crazy ! H.E.L.P.eR. , activate ! H.E.L.P.eR. , disable vocal functions . H.E.L.P.eR. , disable alarm functions ! Oh , come on ! H.E.L.P.eR. , disable all accessible audio functions . Access password , Rusty is a cowboy . - Hey , what gives ? - I didn 't do it . Man , I hope the tape didn 't snap . Brock would kill me . It 's his only tape . It 's Brock 's ? Hey , you think I could borrow it . You know , just for a few days . What 's that ? I freaking knew it . Why didn 't the alarms go off ? 'Cause that 's a UFO . They screw with electrical fields , duh . - Are you sure ? - I 'm totally positive . They just landed behind your freaking house . So that rules out a weather balloon or the moon . I have to call my Dad and Brock and tell them the aliens are back . Back ? What , does this happen a lot ? About as much as ghost hauntings , or time machine guys ... from the past showing up to yell at my Dad . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna put this lighter up my corn hole . So when the aliens try to probe me , and they totally will ... they 'll get a face full of freakin ' fire ! Nobody goes in through my out door . Come on , somebody . Answer your watch . Beggin ' your pardon , mum . Aah ! What are you doing in here ? Monarch is gone . So is the Monarchmobile . He 's with his two cronies . It figures . You want we should go find him ? No , no , no . I know exactly where he is . What I want is for you to get outta here so I can change . We could just close our eyes . And promise not to peek ? - At your body . - At your naked body . Get out ! This is what it 's all about . Ahh , just smell that air . Oh , jeez , that is foul ! Don 't look at me ! There 's a septic tank somewhere around here . That 's the smell of pure hate . I remember the first time I smelled that . I was so young back then . It feels like it was just yest- - Is anybody else really hot ? I am baking here . Why are you fucking hitting your leader ? Your wings are on fire ! There 're lasers all over the place ! What 's - - It 's the septic tank ! It 's gonna blow ! Fuck it ! Run ! Aaah ! What the heck just happened ? Finally , somebody answers . Dude , a UFO landed in Compound East . We 're investigating ! Were you dumped into the panic room ? No , but my stuffed giraffe and your bed sheets were . Well , the security system must be working . But the alarm is busted because of the aliens . Eh- - I 'm sure there 's a scientific and rational explanation . - Did you call Pop ? - Yeah , no answer . - OK , don 't panic . - I won 't . OK ... Well I think I 'm gonna . Dean , don 't hide in the closet . I just need a few moments in here . OK , then take the Uzi . I 'm gonna use this Kalashnikov . Where 'd you get that ? I want an AK , too . Boys , put the weapons back . I want you both to stay here . We need to protect you , mum . From the Monarch . He 's gone all crazy . He 's probably dangerous . - Or worse . - Yeah , or worse . Tim-Tom , Kevin ... The Monarch would never hurt me . You just don 't understand him . He has a deep hate for Dr. Venture . Why ? Because the Monarch has passion . He has more hate in his yellow glove ... than most villains have in their whole costume . Well , why does he hate Dr. Venture ? Because he can 't fake it . He would rather jeopardize his whole career than arch somebody else . That 's why . Because he 's the real thing ! No , mum . What did Dr. Venture do to the Monarch to make them enemies ? Nothing worth destroying a career ... a marriage . I know what I have to do . You boys stay here ! Why can 't we get a straight answer ? I just saw mum 's clean panties . When she was crouching ? I tried not to look . Were they - - They were white panties , Kevin . - White ... - Oooh , white . I can 't believe we didn 't get blown up . Dude , we 're like those guys on TV that never get shot . Hey , we 're like main characters . Don 't jinx it . You see anything ? No , I can 't see squat with these tinted goggles on . Douche , use the night vision . What 's wrong with you ? I can see everything . This is so cool . When did we get these ? Like , 1 994 . Why don 't I know this stuff ? Man , this is so rad . It 's like Blair Witch-o-vision . Those kids eyes look all glowing . - What kids ? - Those two right over there . What are you doing ? Get them ! Super run away ! Take a look at that , Rusty . Ah ! You rebuilding G.U.A.R.D.O. , you pathetic loser . Wanna see if you can get it to suck again ? Huh ? Is that what you want ? Huh ? Well , hello . Dude , what are you doing ? I 'm giving you my Earth germs . I 'm gonna kill you with my cold ! - Die , alien ! - I 'm not an alien , dill-weed . I 'm a henchman . You 're not a Venture brother . Who the hell are you ? - I 'm Hank 's friend . - Yeah , I doubt that . Would you believe I 'm Brock Samson 's long lost son ? If that were true I don 't think I would have caught you so easily . I couldn 't run because I got a lighter up my ass . OK , now I believe you 're Hank 's friend . Here we go . All hands , this is your Queen Butterfly ! Man your stations ! Engine room , prepare for flight ! Navigators to their controls , double time ! Hank ! Hank , I 'm gonna throw up ! Can we stop for a second ? ! - Truce ? - Truce , yes . I 'm dying ! Alright . What are the warning signs of a heart attack ? Get out of my yard . You guys aren 't allowed within 500 feet of us ! Well , you weren 't supposed to be here ! Well , we are . You guys just blew up my backyard . Aw , I 'm gonna get blamed for that . I 'm gonna tell my Dad ! OK , wait , wait ! Don 't call your Dad . Just listen first , OK ? OK , but it better be that you are gonna fix the lawn . Alright , listen . I 'm about to lay some heavy on you . Hank , you can 't die . You 're , like , magic or something . Wait . Are you funnin ' me ? I have personally seen you die twice . Seriously . Like shotgun to the face . You can 't be killed . I shit you not . You are an immortal . - Like the Highlander ? - Yes , like the Highlander . Why are you telling me this ? Because I have something for you . Cool ! Is that for me ? Kinda . I hate killing you , dude . But it 's all I could come up with . It 's OK , Mr. Reachy . Brock will be here soon and everything will be fine . Hello ? Hank ? Hank , is that you ? Did you find out what happened ? Hank ? What are you doing to her ? Umm , giving your robot Chlamydia ? When my Dad finds out about this you 're gonna be in big trouble ! Big trouble ! Yes , good ! Tell your father ! That is the final step in your training . What ? Narc on me and your training will be complete ! You will have become completely evil ! Join me , Dean ! Tell your Dad on me ! No ! I won 't be like you ! Never ever ! Never ever ! Yes , Dean . Complete your final test and tattle on me . Then , and only then will you be a super villain . You can 't make me ! I 'll never tell my Dad ! I will never be evil like you ! Oh , you have bested me this time , master Venture . But next time I 'll be ready ! OK ... Bye . Look , kid , I threw in the grapple cannon ... and the climbing claws . What else do you want ? 50 bucks . I 'm a henchman . We don 't carry cash . Dude , we don 't even really make cash . Alright , fine . I won 't tell anybody about this then . You have my word . - What the hell is that thing ? - My ride . Yeah , a bribe . That kid drove a hard bargain . How did you handle Hank ? Shot him in the chest with a dart gun . Oh , a trank ! I never thought of that . Not a tranquilizer . I used the rifle . No way . They shoot tranquilizers . The- - do ? What- - Why don 't I know that ? Why don 't you people tell me anything ? Enter stealth mode and take her home , boys ! Aye , aye , my love ! - What ? - What ? Hi honey , I 'm home . Uh . Give me the prize ! I am the one ! Now , it took a lot of work ... to get the Guild to agree to this . And it 's only on a trial basis . OK , fine . Can I open my eyes yet ? Ahhh !

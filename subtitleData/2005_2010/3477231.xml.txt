 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ... I 'm here because Sarah Connor is a deluded , dangerous , grade a whack-a-mole who killed a man because she believes he 'll invent a computer system that declares war on the world . I 'm looking for this girl . Have you seen my niece ? There was a guy here looking for your sister . - I 'll get rid of him ! - Riley ! If you don 't leave , I call the police . That guy is really dangerous . That 's all you need to know . This has nothing to do with Riley . You 're pissed off because I found someone I actually like spending time with , and it 's not you . Riley , look at me . Show me that . That 's horrifying . It 's supposed to stop cars from playing ping-pong with your head . I think your mom 's out here . Hi , Mrs. Baum ! Thank you so much for having me over . I didn 't even know if you were busy tonight when I texted you . I 'm never busy . - So , I should do it again sometime . - Or maybe you could call . You know , with your voice . Maybe I could try that . Maybe you should . See you soon ? Okay , be safe . I bought her a helmet . Responsible . You think it 'll stop a bullet ? Why , you gonna take a shot at her ? A lot of bullets fly around here . Someone will . You care about this girl ? Yeah . Then leave her alone . I 'll talk to John . John 's not listening . He 's always listening . I was going to suggest a safe . Well , you might have suggested it before we got robbed . Where are you going ? I need to restock the supply drop . We 've been using a lot of ammunition . Business has been booming . Where 's John ? - Still in his room . - He hasn 't gotten up yet ? He needs more sleep than you do . It 's because the circadian rhythm of teenagers is abnormal . How late were you up talking to him ? Not late . - He won 't be seeing Riley anymore . - Is that so ? John 's not stupid . I don 't like the way he responds to you . You got what you wanted . Where is he ? Check under the bed . You don 't know . I didn 't even know if you were busy when I texted you tonight . I 'm never busy . So then I guess I should do it again sometime . Or maybe you could even call . You know , with your voice . Maybe I could try that . Maybe you should . See you soon . Go , be safe . I 'll talk to John . John 's not listening . He 's always listening . Are you busy ? Did you change ? It 's hot out . Since when do you feel heat ? I feel heat . Are you hoping that Riley 's gonna see us in bed together , and be totally scarred for the rest of her life or something ? I watched Riley leave till I couldn 't see her anymore . And then you and mom high-fived . You bring danger into Riley 's life . I know that . I 'm not stupid . But sometimes you do stupid things . It would help me to understand why . Humans do stupid things . So don 't worry about it , and be happy you 're a machine . I 'm a machine . I can 't be happy . But I understand more than you think . So you understand that I 'm gonna keep seeing Riley , even if everyone thinks it 's a bad idea . I understand that it 's a bad idea . And I understand that being John Connor can be lonely . Oh , yeah ? How do you understand that ? You and I talk about it a lot . We do ? We do . We will . I need to get some sleep . And Riley ? I know . I know . - He won 't be seeing Riley anymore . - I don 't like the way he responds to you . You got what you wanted . It 's just you . You been stealing my supplies ? We needed to make a small bomb . I set this drop up with my people for my people . And everything 's in here for a reason . John was supposed to ask . John needs to get his head in the game . Maybe he couldn 't find you . - You don 't spend time at the house . - I don 't have a bed , remember ? You didn 't have a bed in the old house . I had a gunshot wound at the old house . Yes . You almost died . It 's not the first time . Who 's that ? Alarm code from John . He 's in trouble . I need to get some sleep . And Riley ? I know . I know . Yeah , right . Hey . I 'll be there in a few minutes . Episode 208 : Mr. Ferguson is Ill Today v 1.00 Please stop doing that . Look , I got this from my foster parents . And it 's a rape whistle . It 's totally for moments like this . Moments like this ? Yeah , all right . When I was a kid , I lived in Mexico for a year and a half . In this little village called Dejalo . And ... that 's where we 're going . Thought I 'd show you around . Well , did you run this idea by your mom ? Because sometimes I get the impression that she doesn 't really like surprises . I don 't care . Did you guys get in a fight last night ? No . So this is definitely a field trip , and not some revenge fantasy ? If you don 't wanna go , that 's cool . Don 't make me feel like I 'm kidnapping you . Oh , no , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . You just caught me off guard . I 'm really , really happy that you want to show me where you grew up . Good . 'Cause I booked the honeymoon suite . Wait , what ? It 's good , right ? It 's nice to get some space . You and space . The first time we talked , you were sitting by yourself in the grass . That was space too . So it was . You know I used to watch you at school ? When the bell would ring and those narrow hallways would fill up , it got so loud , and people would bump into you . You looked like you could just jump out the window and run away . God , you 're such a little stalker . All right , so I get that ... We ran away to get some space . The only shame is ... We ran all this way , and there 's skulls everywhere . What , you don 't like skulls ? I like other things better . It 's for Dia de los Muertos . The festival 's tonight . Nice . Skulls and darkness , how charming . Doing the best I can . I never want to leave this room . Wait , I think I see the problem . Would you just get in here ? We don 't need bubbles . Well , there 's bubbles to be had , and I 'm gonna have bubbles . Not bad , huh ? You 're a total pro . Wait , you didn 't live here with your mom , did you ? No . We ... we actually had a cabana on the beach . - We had very different childhoods . - It wasn 't always good . Sometimes I wish we just stayed here . Away from everybody . People suck . Not just people . No , I mean ... when you meet someone , you don 't really expect to give a damn about them , right ? Who 's got the time ? Life 's too short , and people suck . I don 't like getting attached to people . So ... why were you living in Mexico ? - You 're thinking of a lie or a joke . - No , I 'm not . Yes , you are . You have a tell . I just don 't want to sit around and talk about my messed up childhood . Can 't we just enjoy ourselves ? Yeah , fine . Enjoy yourself , John . I 'm sure we 're not the only ones that 's found themselves in a honeymoon suite , and not known the first thing about each other . You 're right . People suck . Podemos tener picante , por favor ? El verde ? Es muy picante como fuego . Si , exactamente . - What was that about ? - Hot sauce . You know , they do this killer Thanksgiving buffet here . I bet . See ? I 'm telling you all sorts of good stuff . I 'm not trying to be your stalker , I just ... This is what we should be doing . Getting to know each other . Well , I have a question for you . You said that I have a tell . What is it ? Okay , you promise not to obsess over it or anything ? What a handsome couple . And for only $ 5 , - a photo memory . - No , thanks . See , a beautiful shot . And it 's all digital . Which means I can email it to you . I think I have something in my teeth . - Oh , well , let me take another . - No , no , really , that 's okay . Hey , I said that 's okay . Look , man , why don 't I ... Why don 't I just give you five bucks , and you 'll delete it . Can you do that ? Gracias , joven . The young boy and mother who stayed in Vivian 's cabana . Thanks a lot . John Connor . No se de quien estas hablando . You 're Sarah Connor 's son . I 'll be right back . I remember when the Connors left Dejalo . And I remember the stories that were told after you were gone . Man , you really ... you really mixed me up with somebody else . I 'm just ... These are pictures you wouldn 't want the authorities to see . - How much ? - Everything you 've got . Hey , back off , man . We gotta get out of here , now . Run ! No ! No se puede salir sin pagar ! Puedo pagar la camara . Stick to English , kid . The American accent is killing me . This is a misunderstanding , that 's all . I 'll pay for the camera , okay ? What the hell were you doing down here anyway ? - We 're just tourists . - Cancun 's not good for you ? This is the guy ? Yes , sir . I was about to take his statement . A man took a picture of me and my girlfriend , he wanted us to buy it . It was crowded , someone bumped into him , he dropped his camera . I was afraid a fight was gonna start , so we tried to leave , that 's all . - How old are you ? - 16 . - You were drinking ? - No . You have parents . My mother and an uncle . They know where you are ? No . I 'll make you a deal . If they come pick you up , I 'll let you go with a warning . Leave a message . - What the hell was that ? - My uncle 's voice mail . Call your mother . Hello ? John , thank God . Where are you ? I 've been going out of my mind . - Did you get through ? - John , are you there ? Are you in trouble ? She didn 't answer . Put him in holding . In a few hours , give him another phone call . And run his name through Interpol . Yes , sir . So which name should I run ? The one on your passport ? Or the real one ? Sir , Sir , hello ? Hi , can you come here , please ? I need your help , please . This guy in here is a complete psycho . He 's been trying to make moves on me . You two came in together . Sir , do you have children ? Do you have a daughter ? My dad told me to stay away from him , and he was totally right . This guy 's a complete freak . I don 't care how much trouble I 'm in . All I want to do is call home and tell them where I am . Please ? Take a step back . - I 'm going to open the door . - Thank you . Lo siento , señor . Lo siento . Riley , you need to listen to me . No matter what happens , if you see daylight , you run . Okay , don 't wait for me . Just run . - What ? What are you do ... - If you see daylight , you run . Your strategy has changed . Has it ? The first time we met , you tried to kill yourself . You 're right . This time I 'm going to kill you . She hasn 't been careful . She 's made mistakes . Not as many as you , but enough . Does she have damage to her chip ? - She has damage to her chip . - How did you find the house ? The boy told me . The one from the bowling alley . You should have killed him . Just like you should have killed yourself . - I 'm not a murderer . - Who is ? I need you to come with me . Agent Crossman , how you doing ? It 's good to hear from you . What 's on your mind ? Mexico . You don 't say . I suppose that they don 't have anyone looking into it over at the bureau . I know . That case has been cold since ' 99 . I was just curious . Sure , email it over and I 'll take a look . Hold on . Yeah , yeah , you 're right . It does look a little bit like him . God rest his soul . You 're with the American FBI ? Yes , that 's right . You have a boy in your custody . His arrest report lists an alias of John Connor , which matches a fugitive of mine . The domestic terrorism case . You 're familiar with the Connors ? It was flagged during processing . But we dismissed it as a coincidence . Your fugitive would be 24 years old by now , if he was not already dead . Look , I 'd be grateful for just a visual identification to help bring me some closure . You have traveled an awful long way for closure . If he is who I think he is , then I have reason to believe that your prisoner is in danger . And yes , I 've come a long way . Excuse me . Daylight , run ! John ! I 'm here to help you . Oh , my God ! The car , Riley ! Get in the car , now ! Now ! Get in ! - You okay ? - Yeah . I 'm fine . Are there any rounds in this thing ? Look for more ammunition . We need more ! - What , you okay ? - I felt something ! Stop the car . Stop the car . I need you to come with me . Mom . We need to move . It 's a clear shot all the way up the alley back to the jail . No , that 's where it will be waiting . Let me do that . I need to be able to use it . I should hope so . Why are you here ? John was flagged in the FBI computer . Couldn 't you just have buried it ? It 's been watching me . It ? Out there . And you still came to Mexico ? - You could have led it right to John . - It wasn 't me in the trunk . So what were you gonna do , just pop him out of jail ? Set him free , no questions asked ? Yes , actually . - That 's exactly what I was going to do . - I have a hard time believing that . I owed you one . The fire . Silberman 's cabin ? Wasn 't much . It was my life . How you feel about that now ? You have to go . I promise I 'll call you as soon as we get back to LA . But you have to go . Riley , don 't . Go home . I swear I 'll explain everything when I get there . Go out the back . Run due east . There 's a bus route . You know what else there is ? A man with a gun who 's killing people . He won 't follow you if you run away from me . I don 't wanna run away from you . Get her out of here . I need your phone . Have a plan ? I 've got a weapon . The girl from the bank vault ? - John and I are in trouble . I need you . - John 's with you ? We 're here already . We 're at the jail . What ? Cromartie 's here . Then we should stay undercover . I 'm looking for John Baum . - Where is he ? - Yo no se . We gotta get out of here . - We gotta find John . - We 're no good to him dead . I can 't let anything happen to him . Escaped or dead ? Escaped ! A little help , por favor ? Don 't worry , it won 't be back . Please ! - John and I are in trouble . I need you . - John 's with you ? We 're here already . We 're at the jail . What ? Wait , wait , wait , Sarah . Then where 's Cromartie ? I am sorry , señor , but I 'm going to have to ask you to leave . I 'm gonna need to see John Connor . - I 'm looking for John Connor . - He 's gone . Are there any other exits ? Have you come to repent ? I 'm looking for John Connor . All things are possible to him who believes . We 'll attract less attention if we don 't travel together . You want me to leave ? What 's next ? We 'll come back down here . And bring something with us to destroy it . His name 's gonna be on an alert . He 's got other names . Then what ? There is no " then what " . Pretend I died again . I lost a lot when you died the first time . My marriage , my career . That 's a lot to you ? I suppose many people lost those things . You want answers . I just want to know my role in all of this . What happens after this ? This is it . There 's nothing else behind the curtain . This is what I do . It 's all I do . You already know why I do it . I 'm sorry for what you lost . But I can 't help you get any of it back . Can I have the chip ?

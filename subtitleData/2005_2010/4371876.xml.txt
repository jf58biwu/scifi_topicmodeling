 Previously on Heroes ... This is good-bye . [ gunshot ] [ groans ] [ sobbing ] I love you , Dad . I love you , Claire-Bear . LINDERMAN : I care about the world . I just want to heal it . What could you possibly know about healing ? A few things . The company has developed a new tracking system . It doesn 't rely on isotopes and satellites . It just finds you wherever you are . We go to New York , we wipe out the Walker System . There 's someone you need to meet . Molly Walker . I hear you have an amazing ability . They ask me where people are , and I find them . THOMPSON : Molly is the only one who can stop Sylar . I must stop you . Then do it . [ gasps ] Do it ! Kill me ! You can 't . Now I 'm gonna have to kill you . No ! Your destiny , Nathan , is to set the course of history after this unspeakable act has occurred . Can 't you be the one we need ? That 's my boy . I explode . I wipe out this whole city- - you , Nathan , everyone . You explode ? Like a nuclear bomb . PETER : If I lose it , you 're the only one who can get close enough to stop me . Me , Ted , doesn 't really matter . But you have to do this . I just miss my family . I hope I can make them proud . Dad ! Claire ! Claire ! What 's he doing ? He 's absorbing your ability . He 's gotta make it stop . Claire , you know what you have to do . Do it . Wait ! I 'm okay . [ speaking Japanese ] [ male voice answers ] Ah . Hello ? Yes . Do you fix ancient Samurai swords ? MAN : Yeah . My name is Hiro Nakamura , and the fate of the world is in your hands . BENNET : So Peter Petrelli is your uncle . CLAIRE : You didn 't know that ? There are a lot of things they never told me . I thought Peter was the only person who could protect me . Now you 're here . Why did you come here ? With them ? The people I used to work for have a tracking system . They can find anybody anywhere in the world . We came here to destroy it . That 's the only way we can ever start over . And build a normal life . Is that even possible ? I mean , I 'm not normal , and they 're not normal . Everything that 's been happening to us has been so monumentally un-normal . I mean , maybe Peter 's right . Maybe we all have a destiny . And it 's to save the world ... together . TED : I just rode 26 hours from Texas to take down the evil bastards who want me dead , and you 're saying I should turn around and go back because of a painting that you saw ? Yeah . That and a dream . He might be nuts , Ted , but he 's not lying . He believes every word of it . PETER : They 'll take out the tracking system , then you 're gonna be free . Free ? I killed people with my powers , okay ? I didn 't mean to , but it happened . And now the FBI thinks I 'm a terrorist . Yeah , but you 're not a terrorist . You need to get out of town before you become one . There 's a town in Nebraska . Windy Fork . Population 15 . I want you to go there and wait for me to contact you . He gave me directions . You 're sending your daughter with them ? Claire tells me she has a destiny . She stopped Ted from melting down once before and saved all our lives- - she could do it again . She could stop both of you . You coming ? I 'm in . SYLAR : Me too . We can do the photo op outside the polls . Yes , Marty--Marty ! I know we 're still behind . That 's why every vote counts . Exit polls have me five points down . Oh , I never listen to polls . [ chuckles ] Be ready , Nathan . Today you will become a congressman . In time , you will lead the country . As long as I let this city become a nuclear wasteland . And let my brother explode . You can 't stop that . No one can . But it 's what comes next . And that ... that is entirely up to us . Your father would be very proud . Pop would have me committed for even considering this nonsense . Clearly , your mother didn 't tell you . Tell me what ? Your father was one of us , someone with great power . He tried to make a difference in the world . He did all he could , and when that wasn 't enough ... he just gave up . Your father was weak . My father was my hero . And when I win- - HEIDI : Nathan ? I thought you were gonna see the boys before they went to school . They wanted to wish you good luck . Oh , u-um . I 'm sorry . I-I didn 't know you were here . That 's all right . I 'm just on my way out . Mrs. Petrelli , your husband is about to become a very powerful man . I would like to give you both a gift to honor his forthcoming victory . Something to make the days ahead a little easier . What is he talking about ? I don 't know . Hmm . I can 't believe you let that man into our house . Honey ... he 's my largest campaign contributor . He 's a thief and a liar and God knows what else . And if I win this election , he 'll be the reason . Why ? Because he gave you money ? Nathan , don 't forget who you are . I know exactly who I am . I 'm a man who 's being asked to make a hard choice for the greater good . And you will . And you 're gonna do great things . But you don 't have to sell your soul ! What ? What is it ? Your foot . It 's moving . What ? [ whispering ] Oh , my God . Oh ... Nathan . Oh , my God . [ breathing heavily ] Oh , oh ! Oh , my God ! It 's a miracle . CLAIRE : You know , I 've been thinking after we save the world , I might go on patrol . You know , jumping in front of bullets and dragging people out of burning buildings . Not gonna catch me wearing a cape , zipping around with my underwear outside my pants . Why do we have to rent a car ? Can 't we just fly to Nebraska ? In a plane . The FBI 's got my face all over wanted posters . I wouldn 't get very far in an airport . SYLAR : Ted 's a fugitive . I can use that to get his power . What is it ? It 's Sylar . He 's here . He 's watching us . CLAIRE : Right now ? He knows what Ted can do . We need to get off the streets . Who 's Sylar ? Would have been nice to have Heidi for the photo op . Something happened back at the house . She all right ? She 's fine . She 's better than fine , actually . Oh , oh ! Nathan Petrelli ! Nathan ! We 'll make an announcement after the election . What 's going on ? Miracles , Marty . HIRO : Nathan Petrelli , Nathan ! Nathan Petrelli ! [ man , indistinct ] HIRO : No , I need to speak to Nathan . It 's all right . Mr. Hiro , how are you ? Fine . Thank you very much . We are trying to stop a bad thing . Shh , shh , shh , shh . The bomb . Big boom . You must help . Or bad future will come . Bad future ? Yes , we went there . But I was already dead . You become a ... bad person , Nathan . But you can come with us now , help us stop bomb- - together . Sorry , Hiro . I can 't stop it . Nobody can . It 's a pleasure to see you again . Thanks for your support . You already bad guy . You are villain ! Villain ! Thank you all . Villain ! D.J. : That 's Petrelli ? JESSICA : Yep . I don 't see Micah . Or Linderman . We know they 're in town . Nathan can tell us where . He 'll never see us coming . [ speaking Japanese ] Mr. Claremont ? It 's me . Hiro Nakamura . I spoke to you on the phone . About my problem . My God . The Kensei . What happened ? It got cold . Frozen . Then ... snap . Can you fix it ? Depends . On him . [ speaking Japanese ] I have a cousin who eats like you . He 's huge . [ chuckles ] So am I. You said you like comic books , so ... I bought you a stack . CANDICE : Anything good ? The original Silver Surfer number one ? This must have cost you a fortune ! Yeah . You 're nice . Even when you 're scary . [ chuckles ] I just don 't understand why you 're working for such a bad guy . You could use your power to be a hero . Oh . [ laughs ] Okay . You 're just too young to see how much the world sucks . How people can be so mean to each other just because of where they were born or what they look like . Mr. Linderman 's gonna change all that . He 's gonna heal the world . I didn 't know it was sick . [ knock on door ] Ah , Candice . Mr. Linderman . How are you ? CANDICE : Good . And how is our boy ? Good , sir . Mm . I wanna see my mom . After today , you can go home . I don 't believe you . I 'm sure other grownups talk down to you , Micah . I 'm not gonna make that mistake . I 'm gonna look you straight in the eye and tell you one simple truth . What you do here today with your incredible ability is going to save many lives . What do you want me to do ? What comes naturally . Talking to machines . And after that , you 'll take me home ? I 'll tell you what . I 'll do better than that . You do as you 're told , and I 'll make sure that you and your parents have enough money to live happily ever after . So this guy Sylar , he kills people like us ? Yeah , to take what we can do . How does he manage that ? He rips your head open . I say we stick with the plan , get out of the city . [ sirens , brakes screeching ] Get out of here . Go ! Federal agents . On your knees ! Now ! Now ! Let 's go ! There were two others ! Find them . You 're under arrest . Agent Hanson ? I 've been chasing you all across the country , Ted . Y-you know I 'm not a terrorist . Do I ? You blew up a van full of federal agents in Los Angeles . But I-I didn 't mean to hurt anybody . Good . Your next stop- - Guantanamo Bay . I 'm gonna need a concrete cell lined with lead . So everyone is safe ! We got him , thanks to your tip , Mister ... Mendez . Isaac Mendez . I thought I recognized Sprague from his picture in the post office . I knew it was my duty to call . Especially with it being election day and all . Well , you helped us capture a very dangerous man . Most people wouldn 't take the risk . I 'm not most people . Welcome , Ms ... Baker . Do you mind if I take my son into the voting booth with me ? I 'm trying to teach him about democracy in action . Oh , what a lovely thought . Follow me . I 've been thinking about how you make yourself look like that . You must bend light or something . [ chuckles ] How do you know this isn 't the real me ? [ chuckling ] Okay , Micah , it 's time to boot up . What do you want me to do ? You can tell computers what to do . So I want you to tell this one and all the others here to vote for Nathan Petrelli . After this , we do the same thing in 12 other precincts . We don 't have to go anywhere else . It says that they 're all networked . So from here , I can change every one in the city . It says that . Yeah . How many votes does your boss want him to win by ? Make it a landslide . [ grunts ] [ breathing heavily ] Can I go home now ? JESSICA : Sorry to interrupt your big day . How did- - I didn 't think I 'd be seeing you again . I thought after you tipped me off about Linderman , you 'd--I figured you 'd be dead . And Niki thought that you were gonna take him out . Let me guess . He made you an offer that you couldn 't refuse . Something like that , yeah . We came here to find Linderman . Who are you ? He took our son . Why would he do that ? Something to do with you and the election . Kidnapping . That 's a serious accusation . I hope you have evidence . Cut the crap , Nathan . We both know that you hate Linderman as much as we do . You were gonna kill him . Let us finish the job . Look , whatever you think you 're getting from this man , he 's gonna take back ten times more from you . And he ain 't never gonna stop until everything you care about is gone . [ cheers and applause outside ] If I tell you where Linderman is ... I have to know that he 's not gonna come after us . The man took my son . He 's gonna pay for that in full . [ Hiro yelling , grunting ] HIRO VOICEOVER : Takezo Kenzei longed to unite Japan . He went to the dragon of Kiso Mountain and asked the dragon to teach him the secrets of the sword . The dragon taught him to become the Kensei , the sword saint . He fought his enemies and won , saving his people . Then the dragon came to his palace , demanding the life of the princess . Kensei drew his sword and plunged it into his own heart . He handed it to the dragon and said , " My love is in here . Take it . " And then he died . [ battle cry ] Tracking system 's on the 42nd floor . Get a read on someone . Yeah . You sure there isn 't another way ? The reason I brought you here , Parkman , was so that you could get us to those elevators without raising a ruckus . Now , if you can 't do that , you might as well give up on your wife and unborn child right now . Because no matter how far you run ... they will find you . Okay . A simple " no " would have done the trick . MAN : Good morning , Stanley . Okay , I got it . Stanley , hey , man . I just took my buddy to lunch . I forgot my ID . Can you buzz us through ? I don 't know you . It 's Matt from accounting on 3-6 . What are you talking about ? We just went to Ray 's for an egg parm . I 'm gonna need to see your ID , buddy . Stan , come on , buddy , you don 't remember ? Remember on the weekend , I ran into you at the , um ... at that restaurant ? STANLEY THINKING : Where did I take Tanya , Shopsins ? Shopsins . Right ? You introduced me to Tanya . I did ? Drank and , God , I hope I didn 't- - You okay , Stan ? Remember ? You were really drunk . And you were worried about people finding out about the ... Uh , you know , the ... the porno . Oh , hey , yeah , don 't worry about it--here . You guys go ahead . Have a good day . Thanks . Thanks , Stan . No problem , sir . [ beeping ] The password doesn 't work . They must have changed the protocol . Great . We have to wait until you can pick it out of somebody 's head . We gotta move . Right now . That blonde works for Linderman . Let 's go . Linderman could be on any floor . Then we 'll search them all . Come on . Mr. Hawkins . Ms. Sanders ? Relax . My friend can hear your thoughts . He says we have similar goals . Didn 't I throw you out a window ? You 're responding well to the treatment . The important question is how are you feeling , Molly ? Good , I guess . As long as I don 't get any more shots . The antibodies in my blood are a cure for the virus . I 'm afraid we will need to continue the treatments . I 'm all better . See ? Look what I can do . Just like before I was sick- - I think about someone , and I know where they are in my head . Right ... here . How do I know you 're not playing a trick just to get out of more shots ? Now , you 've put that pin in this building . Is that supposed to be me ? No . It 's my other hero . If he 's here , can I see him ? Your other hero ? The police officer that saved me from the bogeyman . Molly ... if your power has returned , we can stop the bogeyman so he never hurts anyone else . Can you think about it ? Show me where he is ? You sure you wanna know ? [ door opens ] And how 's our favorite patient , Dr. Suresh ? Much improved . Molly says she can locate Sylar . We should go after him immediately . We will , soon . Right now , you need to go away with Molly . We have a helicopter on its way to take you both to a safe location . [ elevator bell dings ] BENNET : You 'll find Linderman on 51 . Good luck finding your son . Right . Nice to see you too . How do we take out this tracking system ? Erase a hard disk , destroy a satellite link , what ? You did your part . This is mine . THOMPSON : Surveillance picked ' em up in the elevator . What does he want ? Molly . [ thinking ] Good night , Bennet . It was Thompson . I heard him waiting for you . Anybody else ? No . He 's alone . All right , stay here ! What ? No , no , I don 't have a gun ! What am I thinking now , Parkman ? Your last thought . [ gunshots ] [ body drops ] How 'd you know he was gonna come up on me ? We were old friends . MOLLY : Dr. Suresh ? I thought I heard a noise . It 's nothing , Molly . Go back to your room , okay ? Good girl . [ Molly runs off ] All right , look , whatever happens in here , you gotta know this is the only way our families are ever gonna be safe . Why ? What do you mean ? What 's here ? Where 's the tracking system ? It 's in there . That 's the tracking system ? A kid ? We came here to kill a little girl ? No . I knew it was a person , but I had no idea . Lower your gun . As long as she 's alive , my daughter will never be safe . None of them will . Lower your gun , or I will kill you . Shoot me , and she dies . I 'm hurt ! [ sobbing ] I think it 's bad ! Here , let me help . [ screaming ] Ando ! Where is my friend ? He bought one of my Nagamakis and left . He bought a sword ? He said if you weren 't going to save the world , he would . [ horns honking ] PETER : Hey , move the car ! Come on , get moving ! Is this the only way out of the city ? No , but it 's the fastest . This is the sickest thing I 've ever seen . Did this happen in the accident ? The top of the guy 's head came off ! How else does that happen ? You don 't wanna know . Sylar got him . He killed Ted . Does that mean Sylar can do what Ted can do ? He 's the one . He 's gonna wipe out the entire city . You 've gotta stop him . I don 't think I can . The last time I fought Sylar , he killed me . Come on . Come on . LINDERMAN : Yes , we 'll send a helicopter to retrieve the Petrelli family . Just make sure they 're not late . Bill . Jessica ? I must admit , I 'm quite surprised to see you here . Where 's Micah ? She asked you a question . You wouldn 't even have Micah if it wasn 't for me ... arranging your relationship . Crafting your opportunities . What gives you the right to ruin our lives , take our boy from his home , your money ? You think being rich makes you better than us ? Well , social Darwinism did play its part . I believe destiny to be intrinsic . Your destiny ... is to give me back my son . He 's in the building . 42nd floor . I 'll go look for Micah . Watch him . You 'll never see him again , you know . D.L. : How 's that ? Jessica 's gonna kill you for me . [ softly ] Open the bag . You just caught me preparing for a trip . Yes . Hmm . Well , consider this a deposit with more to follow . How much more ? You can 't be listening to this ! Of course she is . Like most women whose lives have been ruined by men , all Jessica really wants is security , and money buys that . Money 's all she 's ever really cared about . She cares about our son . How much ? 5 , 10 million ? Think about Micah . You saw that painting . You came here to save him . All right . $ 20 million to kill your husband and walk away . He 's right , D.L. I wanna take the money . I really do . I would even kill you for it . But Niki wouldn 't . [ inhales ] Niki ! D ! You don 't love him . Everything I 've done ... I did for them . Unh ! You should have taken the money . [ groans ] I don 't care what he said . Me and you getting together- - that was real . Jessica wasn 't the strong one . It was you . NIKI : Baby ... [ crowd murmuring ] I feel so stupid sitting here . I wanna jump out of this damn chair . People don 't believe in miracles . When the time is right , we 'll tell everyone . MARTY : We 're ready . [ audience cheers ] Thank you . Thank you all . Thank you very much for your amazing support . A landslide . That 's what they 're calling it . [ cheering ] I 'm sorry my brother couldn 't be with us tonight . But I know that Peter cares about this city more than anyone . You know , our father always said that we had a responsibility to use what God gave us . To help people . To make a real difference . Pop always made the hard choices for the greater good . He believed in that . And so do I. Our children deserve that . They deserve a better future . A future where they don 't have to face their fears alone ... but can look into the darkness and find hope . I challenge everyone in here to inspire by example to fight the battle , no matter the cost . Because the world is sick and spinning out of control . But we can help . With our help , it can heal . With our love , with our compassion , and with our strength we can heal it . Let 's put aside our differences . Let 's embrace our common goals . Let 's do it for our children . Let 's show them all exactly what we 're capable of . Thank you all . [ audiences starts cheering ] Thank you very much . Thank you . [ cheering continues ] SYLAR : Boom .

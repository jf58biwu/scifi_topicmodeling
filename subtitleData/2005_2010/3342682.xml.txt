One of the oldest ontinuously functioning convents in Central Asia . Now occupied by a necetic branch of no light The convent was struckedby a missile late last night There were no survivors . An initial reaction from the No light . It is a tragedy to think that even defenseless women who make the choice to withdraw from society and lead a life of purity suffer the attacks from terrorists who have no respect for the lives of decent god-fearing people . We shall mourn our sisters . The No lights has been persecuted too long Tomorrow will be the dawn of a new age Congratulations , my friend . You made it safe and sound Gorsky . Did you destroyed the convent ? I am not a terrorist , Toorop I am a mercenary like you . Bullshit What the hell is going on ?

Deliver the package , my men will be there to be sure you do They never hurt anybody Maybe it was an accident . It was not an accident . It was destroyed right after we crossed the border . would you like to pray with me ? I don 't feel like prayinmg anymore . Toorop said I am just a package to him . Is that all I am to you ? Of course not , I love you . How is he ? Scared . It should be . Who are they ? To the left the range rover going works for your sect of No lights To the right , the bikers works for Gorsky . They 're all here to make sure I deliver And if we don 't ? It 's gonna be a free fall . Look sister . We traveled 6 thousand miles together . The truth is that this has been a suicide mission from the beginning They won 't let either one of use walk out here alive . The doctor that came to the convent 3 months ago . Answer the door , act with nothing is wrong . OK Good Eveningt sister . Good Evening . Good Evening Where is she ? In the room . You are a bad man . Thank you Aurora . Thank you so much .

Protect them . I need you to live Aurora was our miracle . A true virgin . This was to make our the dominant religion of the world . Now we don 't know that happened to her . In this mess , there 's no sign of Aurora . We can 't find her . We 're finally on a verge of becoming a bonafide religion . and your incompetence has thrown 20 years of careful planning down the tubes . Who gave the order to use guns to retrieve her ? You left Gorsky no choice , What were you thinking ? Your Highness . What ? The body stolen from the morgue was Toorop they found the van that transported him to New Jersey Who would want to abduct the body of a dead man ? He is back on line . Where are you taking me ? Mr. Toorop is not a prisoner , you can release him . Good evening , Mr. Toorop . I 'm Dr. Darquandier , Aurora 's father . I thought you were dead Sometimes it is useful to be dead if the last one has the second chance .. You 'll see . Oh yes , you were clinically dead for two hours We lost quitea bit of time getting you from the morgue . And then you went into a coma for 5 days . I fixed you up as best I could . Now , Mr. Toorop , I believe I owe you some explanation . you see , 20 years ago , I was drummed out of the medical profession for trying to implant human babies with artificial intelligence . Around that time , the no lights came to me to create smartest , stronger , healthier human beings .. So I built a super computer to be Aurora 's artificail mother .. Ass a fetus Aurora learned to process information just like a computer . Until she was born , she became much more than just an experiment you see , she became .. she became my daughter . She was beautiful , she was unique , and I couldn 't bring myself to give her away . That 's when they hired Gorsky to kill me and .. well , they almost suceeded . He took my baby away and hid her from the No lights , I searched for her for years , but I couldn 't find her . I knew , that one day the No lights would have to present a miracle to the rest of the world . What do you want from me ? I want you to find my daughter We think she is still alive . And if she has left you a message , you died with your eyes open . but your brain recorded more than you can actually remember . we just need to rewind the tape . You need to return to the same condition when she would have found you . Almost dead ? Quite . What am I looking for ? What you missed the first time . Will guide your memory with our computer . Are you ready , Mr. Toorop ? Stay with the memory . Move forward a little bit . Focus on the memories of Aurora . We are going to be seeing her . very Good . That 's right , We are getting there . Now good , focus on his gun . Easy , easy , steady steady . He 's way past the danger threshold I know , but he 'll be fine . He 'll be fine OK , slow down slow down now. slow down . let 's push .. I need you to live . His dead Wait , don 't bring him back yet . He 's almost there . Go home . Alright , alright . you 're back , you 're safe .. I know where she is . Mr. Gorsky . I hoped I wouldn 't have to see you again . Where is my Money ? You still haven 't paid me . You have an odd way of killing people . What are you talking about ? I am on my way to see our old friend Darquandier Impossible , I made his car explode myself . Mr. Gorsky when I kill I kill for good . Are you threatening me ? Blessed your soul . you 'll need a nuke to kill me . Beef . How did you survived the blast ? it 's the babies you see .. .. I gave him power , they are the one guiding her . The rescue for survival is greater than anything we could have ever imagined . Professor , your wife is found . she 'll be here in two minutes . Find the door opened , you 're the only that can save her now . So where we go ? North . Hello my dear , it 's lovely to see you . Where is my daughter ? I see you haven 't found her . And you never will . you selfish bastard .. 20 years ago I gave you the opportunity you want . Now it 's my turn . Where is my daughter ? She 's not your daughter . She comes from me . I design her . For me , she 's my miracle , she belongs to my church . Your church is a lie . you 're paying miracles for your own profits .. Are you willing to die for her ? Yes . Find Toorop . He knows where she is . We 're here . You 're finally home What 's left of it . But I came back for you . Have a little faith . Toorop , they are coming . Quick left . Toorop , they need help . Take the wheel .. Toorop . Thank you Protect them . You 're their father now . Aurora Thank you , my children will be fine . You 're gonna be OK . Take care of them Toorop . Hey kids ... There is a storm coming we need to go Ready ? OK , Dad . by virstud

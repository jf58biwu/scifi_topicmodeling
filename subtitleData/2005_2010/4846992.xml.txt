 Previously on Defying Gravity . [ Evram ] This is what 's been causing our hallucinations . - It 's fractal - It 's-It 's a fractal . - Like my tomatoes . - [ Wass ] She cut ' em down ! - Why , Jen ? - I don 't feel chosen . - You are , trust me . It 's the coming of the rapture . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to Beta . There 's seven of these containers . Only one of 'em 's full . Five other focused signals ... have communicated with the Beta object over the years . The Gamma object is on Venus , Delta on Mercury ... Epsilon on Europa , Zeta on the rings of Saturn ... and Eta on the surface of Pluto . - It 's gonna be our job to go pick these things up ? - Yes . That is the primary goal of the Antares mission . I 'm second in command . I need to know what 's going on . I need to know what I 'm doing ! This is history repeating itself . - We were there to pick up the Alpha object . - Launch now ! Goss knew . Walker knew . Sharon knew . Those that hear the Lord 's trumpet will be saved ... and those that don 't will be damned . [ Maddux ] As an astronaut , you expect to face the unknown . You hope for it . If you 're a true spacejunkie , you crave it . Hell , that 's what gets you into the game in the first place - the face time with the ultimate stranger . [ Gasps , Exhales ] But then , when you get up here ... and you 're facing a billion miles of darkness in every direction ... the dream 's become a reality ... and , uh - You know , that 's - that 's when it hits you ... - that - - [ Droning ] Did I make some kind of mistake ? Did it make some kind of mistake ? I mean , what - what am I even doing up here ... if I can 't see or hear the thing ? I have no idea what this thing is . That should scare me . [ Droning ] But the truth is , it doesn 't scare me . It kind of scares me that it doesn 't scare me . # Why you doing your happy dance Because I 'm happy # # Because I know I 'm on a ship You don 't # # I know I 'm on a ship You don 't # # I know I 'm on a ship and you don 't # # Because it 's fractalrific , what Because it 's fractalrific # # - [ Droning ] - [ Exhales ] [ Inhales ] [ Maddux ] When you come face-to-face with the unknown ... you can 't run away . You have no choice but to deal with it . Can you confirm that Sharon and Walker were pickin ' one of these things up on Mars ? - Yes . - And we 're goin ' back to finish what they couldn 't do . - Yes . - Full disclosure , Eve ? - Except for that little detail ? - Ted - Did they even know what the hell they were doing down there on Mars ... or did you keep the real mission from them too ? They knew what we knew , which was very little back then . [ Chuckles ] So we 're experts now ? We 've come a long way in understanding Beta . Yeah , yeah . Well , it feels that way from up here . How do we know the same thing 's not gonna happen again ? The Mars mission failed because it didn 't want Walker . I knew it then , but I didn 't have the authority to shut it down . - You have that now . - Yes . It was because of Mars ... that I was given a voice on the Antares mission . But right now , there is no evidence of a problem with Venus . So why do you keep hiding things from us ? How does it help to remind this crew of a horrific disaster ? You 're all dealing with so much right now , emotionally , physically - You need to stay focused on the task at hand ... and look forward , not back . I 'm trying to protect you . I 'm trying to keep you safe . I 'm concerned about the medical side effects of Beta . The heart plaque , hallucinations . I 'd like to understand what it might do next ... and share the rest of our findings with Dr. Mintz . We need to keep medical hypotheses to a minimum ... and right now Evram has to concentrate on crew psych evals . - Mike - - Surgeon . Let 's just stick to the plan . Rollie , as first line of communication ... you need to report on any unusual changes in crew behavior . - Copy that . - Changes will be subtle . They 're trained to keep their emotions in check . And rebuilding trust may take some time . [ Maddux ] So that 's it ? We 're done talkin 'about this ? What do you want me to do , Donner ? Turn this ship around and go home ? No . What I would like is for somebody down in Mission Control ... to admit that because they kept us in the dark , we don 't know what 's goin ' on . We 're not ready for Venus , Ted , and nobody down there even seems to care . I do not agree with Eve 's approach , Donner ... but believe it or not , she does care about the success of this mission . Is that your professional opinion , or your personal ? - Oh , you wanna talk about the truth ? - Yeah . Well , as a husband , I 'm pissed . I 'm mad as hell . But don 't you ever accuse me of letting my feelings get in the way of me doing my job . - D. , I get it . You lost Sharon . You don 't wanna lose Zoe too . - What-Where - You are not the only one who feels guilt about what happened 10 years ago . - We all know what 's at stake here . - Do we ? You know , until we hear differently , it 's all systems go . Now , what I need from you is for you to forget about Mars right now . - Oh ! - And please forget about Sharon . [ Droning ] Hey . Form 24 's in 10 minutes . - So , you good with Venus ? - I 'm fine , Donner . [ Thunder Crashing ] I must have burned through 600 red crayons drawing that sky as a kid . I get up here , and the damn thing 's orange . [ Child 's Voice , Echoing ] Sharon ! Might have changed things for me . [ Child ] Sharon ! What ? The color of the sky looks pretty on you . [ Chuckles ] You all right ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I 'm - I 'm fine . L - I just , uh - I keep thinking about my childhood best friend , Tabitha . - Haven 't seen her since I was eight year old . - Mmm . Random childhood memories . You know , that 's a textbook symptom of cabin fever . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . Day six of the last mission , I was reciting chapter three of the Cub Scout guidebook . It was the campfire - building it , enjoying it , putting it out . - [ Giggling ] - I was a lot of fun . I 'm sure you were . Did you have a cure for cabin fever ? Well , they say that in times of extra-orbital crisis ... one helps a crewmate , uh , think of other things . - Mmm . Things . - Mm-hmm . You know , like ... things . Donner . You know the rule . - That 's another symptom - memory loss . - Mmm . [ Panting ] You guys , very sweet ... but get a room . [ Maddux ] You just work out ? Nope , but I 'm about to . What the hell were you doing back there , lonely heart ? You 're sweatin 'like a pig , you haven 't lifted a finger yet . [ Droning ] Come on . [ Trevor ] It 's a first in history . The American members of the Antares crew ... will cast their ballots in real time ... nearly 45 million kilometers from Earth . Universal frontiersmen and women ... but first and foremost , loyal citizens of their country . - Tara ? - Stay tuned for U.S. Election results ... brought to you live from the reaches of outer space . - Let the countdown begin . - [ Droning ] Although somehow electing the new leader of the free world seems rather trivial . - Do you have a favorite ? - Daddy 's rule : Never reveal your lovers or your politicians . - That 's a wise man . - Yeah . Jen . - I 'm Canadian . - You 're married to an American . Which makes him Canadian . Okay . Here you go . Okay . I 'm gonna need some peroxide and an ice cube . Nipple piercing ? [ Paula ] Ew . That 's nasty . [ Droning ] Okay , Beta thought it was funny . Just trying to lighten things up , guys . Oh ! - Ah . That 's it . - [ Paula ] Take this seriously . Okay , fine . Here , look . I 'm like a giant with this . - [ Imitates Wind Blowing ] - [ Chuckles ] - Paula 's thumb looks really good . - Okay . Good enough to pilot the lander ? - Paula 's busting her ass . - I didn 't say she wasn 't . - Check this out . It 's cool . - Full lander rundown today , and Paula 's at the wheel . - She 'll ace it . - Well , then she 's cleared . [ Laughing ] How 's it possible that we 've gone through a two-month supply of dental floss in a day ? I don 't know . I 'm a toothpick guy . [ Nadia ] No , I will not keep it status quo . Form 24 will wait until we have a clear set of instructions . Your instructions are to move forward . Venus insertion tonight , Nadia . Well , until someone tells me what this thing is ... this ship moves forward without me . [ Chattering ] - Hey , Arnel . - [ Woman On P.A. , Indistinct ] - Mike ! - Answer 's no . You have no idea what I was gonna say . You show me something new , I 'll polish your Pulitzer . Oh ! You 're a funny man , Goss , but I did have one small question . Something along the lines of , why am I stuck doing a puff piece ... on an election that half the crew are not eligible to vote in ... when I.S.O. Refuses to give a reasonable explanation ... for the high-security lockdown yesterday ? Solar flare drill . You got the memo . Well , it seemed rather incomplete ... given the trillions of dollars of public money being spent . And what about that meeting ? Everyone seemed a little rattled . - Makeup on your collar . - Rapid swallow . Stress gesture . That meeting was a standard protocol brief . It 's business as usual . Great . Then you 'll have no problem giving me an exclusive with the Antares crew . Rest assured , Mr. Williams , this little puff piece you 're doing ... is as close as you are ever gonna get to my astronauts . You like things in order . According to plan . By the book . And suddenly , with the reveal of Beta , poof - the plan has changed . That must bother you . That must make you feel vulnerable . Are we done ? I don 't know . Are we ? Things have changed up here . They will continue to change . How do you feel about that ? I feel lied to , I feel pissed , and I feel stupid . I knew we weren 't being given the whole story . I should have called this weeks ago . And what would you have done ? I would have asked the question we all should be asking right now . What is this thing , and what does it do ? And what if they don 't know ? Don 't know , or ... don 't want to know ? [ Chuckles ] - Your pilot 's handling it well . - She will come around . Yeah ? Nadia Schilling 's the only candidate in I.S.O. History with 137 % attendance record . - I don 't think she quits without a damn good reason . - Neither do you . You really not gonna let this thing go ? No , ' cause we 're making all the same mistakes we made on Mars , Ted . The hallucinations that Zoe 's having ? Sharon had those . Paula 's thumb ? Remember when Walker had his health problems ? He had the angina , he had the shortness of breath . - Beta didn 't want Walker , and they didn 't listen . - Maybe he doesn 't want Paula . - Beta chose Paula . It didn 't injure her thumb . - Says who ? If she 's not the one , it 'll let us know . Like it did with Sharon and Walker ? I should be piloting that lander , Ted . Tell me you don 't believe that . What I believe is that I 'm doing the right thing by letting it play out . Now , I have to believe that . That is all I have . - [ Thunder Crashing ] - [ Sobbing ] [ Children 's Voices ] What 's wrong ? Hey . What are you lookin ' at ? [ Sobbing ] Hey . What 's the matter ? Do me a favor . Don 't strain yourself . See all this right here ? I got it . Story of my life . Movin ' - Day Ted . You know you 're gonna owe me when we get back home , right ? - Hot beer and cold pizza . - Sharon was up all night last night . I did the manly , supportive thing , let her keep me up too . [ Chuckling ] Nervous about that last walk ? One of us is . - You talk to Goss about Walker 's breathing ? - This morning . Gave him the thumbs-up to do his own self-eval . - [ Grunting ] Don 't worry . I got it . - You know what he 's gonna say . He wants another crack on the rover . Did they run his med band at M. C ? [ Sighs ] That 's what they said . [ Exhales ] You know Goss isn 't gonna clear him unless he 's okay . They 're old air force buddies . Walker says he can fly , Goss offers him a scotch and an extra pillow . Hey . You know what ? If he 's not a hundred percent , I should be on that rover with Sharon . Absolutely not , because you arejust trying to get out of packing 'this place up . Think I 'm doing a good job too . All right . And take a nice Sunday ride on Mars with your lady . - Perfect weather for it . - Mmm . You 're not goin ' . This means no . [ Chuckling ] [ Sighs ] - [ Beeping ] - [ Zoe ] Thrust translation . - [ Paula ] Fore jets ? - Balance couple . On . - [ Powering Up ] - Starting landing sequence . Thirty meters . Twenty . T.C.A. Throttle minimum mode control set . A.G.S. Reading 400 plus one . Stand by . Stand by for [ Computer Voice ] Simulation complete . - Touchdown ! Whoo-hoo ! You rock , Paula . Flawless . Two more days . I can 't believe it 's finally happening . Yeah , I wish we were all this excited about Venus . Natural brightest spot in the night sky , named after a Roman goddess . - What is not to love ? - Has Donner said anything to you about the mission ? No . Why ? Since we found out about Beta , he 's been looking at me like , um - I don 't know . Like he really doesn 't want it to happen . Well , he 's just being cautious . It 's understandable , especially now . Yeah , I think he 's already written the headline . " Naive geologist incinerated while picking up alien rock . " Beta isn 't alien , Zoe . Don 't you see ? It 's God . It 's God sending us a sign that our faith will be rewarded . He will guide us . That and five years of brutal I.S.O. Training . My mom gave me a Saint Christopher when I was confirmed . - Your mom ? - Yeah . An Episcopalian astrologer . Go figure . Well , don 't let Donner shake you . We 're in God 's hands in this lander , not just mine . [ Rollie On Radio ] I was planning to wait for your birthday , but - Cold . - I 'm really not in the mood - - Warmer . [ Sighs ] For games right now . Toasty . Okay . Toasty . Oh , you 're hot . You 're hot - Scorching . - What 's this ? - You 'll see . [ Exhales ] It 's beautiful . - It 's your birthstone . - [ Sighs ] Aquamarine . It means courage . They were out of nervous wreck ? Yeah . Babe , I - I know everything is heavy . Everything that you 're dealing with . Rollie , there is a thing on board with us . Okay , a thing that you knew about and just forgot to mention to me . So while this is thoughtful and sweet ... it doesn 't make that right . Jen . I did what I had to do , and I 'm sorry . - I 'm your wife . - How many times do you want me to say it ? 'Cause I will , as many times as it takes . I am sorry . I know you 're furious right now ... but you can 't keep shutting me out . [ Hatch Opens ] I gotta roll . - [ Exhales ] Good chat with Rollie ? - Where 've you been ? Huh . Argument with Rollie . - I was helping Paula practice in the lander . - Yeah ? How 's she doing ? Great , in a weird , churchy sort of way . - So all systems go ? - Yeah . She passes Mintz 's test this afternoon , and Paula , the big guy and I ... are goin ' to Venus . You know , I can 't blame her for being weird though . Everything that 's happened with her thumb ? Oh , and by the way , there 's an alien thingy on board , and guess what - - It has friends . - Donner got to you too ? Zoe , we just found out that the I.S.O. Is using this ship as a courier service . Jen , it 's science . I mean , this is it . It 's science that we scientists can 't study or touch or s - Jen ? [ Exhales ] Can we just rewind back to the girl talk ? All right . Like how you 've been avoiding me all morning ? [ Droning ] Why don 't we just say that it actually has nothing to do with you ? How ' bout we say we share a lab , you went nuts ... and massacred your pet tomato experiment a few days ago ... and , uh , it 's a professional courtesy to make sure I 'm not next . Jen , I 'm kidding . Zoe , I can 't see it . I can 't see it . I can 't hear it . I can 't see Beta . Just thank you very much indeed . Uh , Mr. Poe ? Would you care to comment on the election festivities ? People going through the motions . Election ? Come on . As if they actually have a choice . Right . True . Very true . But then it 's a big distraction , isn 't it , from what 's happening on the ship ? I can read the faces on the floor . - Something 's going on . - See , that 's the thing about high security . - We 're not allowed to talk about it . - " It " ? So there is something . Come on , Arnel ! Six years . Every movement , body function and thought process closely monitored . Pressures many , rewards dubious . Can 't be easy . They 're highly skilled astronauts , Trevor . No matter what the crisis , the Antares crew are trained , and they 'll be fine . I was talking about you . - [ Walker ] Sharon ? - Mission Base ? - [ Buzzing ] - Mission Base ? - Sharon . - Donner ? - Walker has chest pains . - Sharon ? [ Maddux ] Push , Sharon . You gotta keep moving . [ Sharon 's Voice ] Donner . We are gonna figure this out , all right ? There 's some reason for this . Eve said it wants what it wants . Well , then it clearly doesn 't want me . If it chose us , then maybe it made a mistake . Maybe I 'm not even supposed to be here . - That is crazy . - Is it ? I 'm a biologist . Eve said it 's organic . If anyone should be able to see it , it 's me . It 's gonna be okay . We 're gonna figure out the reason . Did it tell you that ? If you are meant to communicate with Beta , it will happen . [ Scoffs ] And what ? In the meantime , just shut up , grow more tomatoes ? I mean , nobody in the crew even likes tomatoes . It 's symbolic , really . They 're sitting there in the galley , rotting away . [ Sighs ] I don 't understand how you are not totally freaked out by this . L - I don 't know . I just - I feel really positive . [ Exhales ] Wow . Again with the " me . " Jen , the Venus walk is in two days . This mission , it means everything to me . Forgive me for not berating myself for feeling positive about it . How is it that me not seeing Beta has suddenly become about you walking on Venus ? No , no . I am trying to help here . Go help Paula . [ Woman On P.A. , Indistinct ] What 's up ? Um ... it 's Jen . - Hallucinations ? - No , no . Nothing like that . She 's , uh - She 's angry ... and she 's not talking to me , and she 's fighting with Zoe . Well - [ Sighs ] Emotional withdrawal is perfectly normal under the circumstances . Yeah . Well , not for us . Not forJen . You know , when we got married , we made a rule . We could get angry , fight , slam doors , sulk , whatever ... but three hours ' time , we would come back and discuss it ... try to work it out . Or screw . Well , are the three hours up ? [ Chuckles ] No . No , they 're just starting actually . You know , I know Jen . She 'll come around . - You 're not voting ? - Think I 'll pass this time . - But it 's your constitutional right . - Sure . Just like it was our choice to be part of the Antares mission . Arnel ? Six years of undergrad , two Ph.D. ' s , five years of training . You have to believe that there 's a higher purpose in all of this . I know you 've sacrificed a lot for I.S.O. We all know that . Eve said that the Antares crew was chosen ... that it was all predestined . What did I sacrifice for , Ajay ? I never even had a shot . # # [ Slow Rock ] [ Man ] # Do you really think you can just put it in a safe # # Behind a painting Lock it up and leave # # Do you really think you can just put it in a safe # # Behind a painting Lock it up and leave # # Walk away now # # And you 're gonna start a war # # Whatever went away I 'll get it over now # # I 'll get money I 'll get funny again # # Whatever went away I 'll get it over now # # I 'll get money I 'll get funny again # # Walk away now # # And you 're gonna start a war # # Can I have a word , now ? What is it with you ? You 've been staring at me all day . Frankly , it 's creeping me out . - You having the dream again ? - No . - Then what ? - Paula can 't pilot that lander . I have been with her all day . Her reflex scores are through the roof . No . Zoe . I 'm telling you , this is the Mars disaster all over again ... unless we start doing things the right way . The right way , or your way ? You 're not goin ' to Venus without me . [ Maddux ] Walker should have never been on that rover , okay ? He wasn 't supposed to be there . That 's why the mission failed - because the thing rejected him . - The object caused a storm on Mars ? - That 's from Eve . Okay ? Plus , I was there , and I didn 't know the signs to look for at the time ... but I do now , and they were there . [ Exhales ] Sharon was hallucinating in the hab . Right before she was scheduled to do that walk , just like you are ... she was hearing things , she was seeing things . - What things ? - Things . Personal things . Stuff . Like Mintz was talking about . The - The - I don 't know . There was a storm , okay ? She had an accident when she was a kid . There was a thunderstorm in the woods , and there was a friend of hers , a little girl . Got lost and she didn 't make it back . Sharon - She took it hard . She thought it was her fault . So when we were in the hab , she would hear thunder . And - What have you been hearing ? Huh ? I 'm sorry . It 's - I can 't . All right . It doesn 't matter . Listen . There 'll be other missions . You don 't have to do this one . Um , I 'm going to Venus ... with Paula ... and it 's going to be fine . - What if you 're wrong ? - Then I 'll be wrong . But I am not Sharon . I don 't need you to save me . Jen . Did you take the straws ? Yeah . Symbolic gesture of how much it sucks to be on this ship right now . [ Sighs ] You all really look like you need a drink . And the election results are coming in . - Major Tom 's ? My treat . - Already there . Yeah , me too , soon as we finish up with Paula . Yeah . I 'll meet you in a few . [ Woman On P.A. ] Mike Dodd , line three . Mike Dodd , line three . Hey , do me a favor . Go get a coffee , will ya ? [ Beeping ] [ Sighs ] - What 's up , Ajay ? - Jen , it 's me . That 's tricky . It 's , um , two hours and three minutes , baby . [ Woman On Radio ] A couple other system functions that we 're still trying to restore . - Jen , please . - What do you want me to say to you , Rollie ? That I have no idea what I am doing on this ship ? Of course you know what you 're doing . You 're a biologist . This is the mission of a lifetime . I can 't see it . Rollie , I can 't see it . I can 't hear it . L-I can 't - Wait . You can 't see Beta ? Okay . Look . I don 't know how this thing works or why ... but if it didn 't want you on the ship , you would know it . It chose you , Jen . Oh , I am so sick of hearing that from everyone ! What have I been chosen for ? Am-Am I up here to be some kind of sacrificial lamb ? Jen , I know you 're scared . I 'm scared too . But it 's not me you 're angry with . It 's the universe , and that is an unfair match . Well , what do we do after three hours up here , Rollie ? What then ? - # # [ News Theme ] - [ Tara ] Welcome back on this exciting electoral day . We have a result out of South Carolina now . Jane Kendrick the projected winner out of South Carolina . - [ Zoe ] Thumb dexterity . - [ Evram ] Nominal . - Muscle memory . - Nominal . Good work , Paula . Run through mode control , and you are good to go . Elevated pulse . It 's to be expected under the circumstance . [ Beeping ] - [ Computer Voice ] Flight parameters have been exceeded . - What ? - No , no , no , no . - Simulation failed . Wait . Hold on . Hold on . And restarting landing sequence . [ Beeping ] - Flight parameters have been exceeded . - No . Simulation failed . - [ Paula ] Restarting landing sequence . - Evram ? - Zoe , what 's happening ? - I 'm not sure . Let 's just give her a minute here . [ Rapid Beeping ] Her B.P. ' s up . I 'm seeing stress in her extremities . - Flight parameters have been exceeded . - I don 't know . Simulation failed . My thumb . Oh , Paula . Paula failed . - [ Beeping ] - [ Motor Stops ] Looks like you 're the pilot . Open up , Wassenfelder . [ Singsong ] Not decent . I don 't care if you 're wearing chaps and a plunger . Let me in . Meow . [ Snarls ] Straws and dental floss ? L-It 's a ... mechanical model . Yeah . Of a - Of an N-plus-1 - dimensional universe ... arising from quantum fluctuations - said quantum fluctuation being the alien Beta . Yeah , I just wanna be able to grease my calculations without M. C ... tracking my every cha-cha on the computer , you know what I 'm sayin ' ? So then you know what Beta is ? Oh , no . Not a clue . No . I mean , it 's everything , you know , and nothing . It 's - It 's here , it 's there ... it 's-it 's us , them , it 's the universe , it 's - Screw the physics haiku . I need to know what it 's for , what it does . Yeah , well , you know , I 'm still tinkering with the practical implications . I mean , this - this is next-level stuff . I just need a little time . And I don 't have time , Steven . Venus orbit insertion in six hours . Okay . Well , you know ... isn 't it enough to know you made the cut ... that out of everyjerk in the galaxy , it picked us ? Picked us for what ? The greatest - greatest space mission in , like , the history of humankind ! No ? Not good enough . What happened to you ? You 're the leader of the pack , the charger , numero eins ! But you 're not gettin 'this ? This is the cool part . This is where you finally get to charge . [ Maddux ] What ? What 's that ? [ Russian Accent ] This is a gift from the Russians . - [ Chuckling ] - Ah , well , God bless the Russians . [ Chuckles ] Ah . [ Sighs ] - Nazdrovia . - Nasty over you . Mmm . You know you knew all along that you were gonna be going to Venus . No , uh , I wanted it , but , uh - I , uh - I don 't know - hope I 'm not wrong . - What if I 'm wrong ? - Maybe you are . I don 't know . You know , I so don 't know anymore ... that ... I don 't even know what it is ... that I don 't even know anymore . [ Chuckles ] Yeah , I don 't know . So maybe this isn 't about the mistakes we made on Mars . Maybe ... it 's about second chances . Hmm . Paula , who cares about the stupid election coverage ? You don 't need to do this . Not now . It 's okay . I can totally do this . - Really ? - Yeah . - [ Man ] One minute to air , Antares . - Copy that . - It 's really okay . - Okay . Yo . [ Man ] Five , four , three , two - And we are live to air , Antares . - Hello , Paula Morales . - Hello , Tara ! I am here on the Antares with the results ... from the world 's spaciest polling station ... Venus . Where , I understand , you 'll be landing in a couple of days . Well , not exactly , Tara . Um - - You see , unfortunately - - Why the hell don 't they have the press release on Paula ? - It went out two hours ago . - My injured thumb is refusing to heal . - Oh . I 'm sorry to hear that . - Oh , that 's okay . The Lord giveth , and the Lord taketh away . Like - LikeJob , I feel I am being tested , you see ... as if Satan himself ... were on this ship and - And that Satan is me . Yeah , yeah . The , uh , little devil that just won 't stop pickin ' on Paula ... even , uh , during election time ... which we are all , uh , very excited about ... because it is time for the changing of the brass of the old red , white and blue . Get the producer on the line and wrap him up fast . - [ Wass ] That 's right . Wassenfelder 's your man . - Paula . Is Mintz on this ? As best he can . We can 't keep them prisoners , Mike . They will continue to make calls ... send messages , fall apart . Who knows what they 're gonna do next ? Frankly , I don 't think it 's the crew we need to be worried about right now . So , who will it be , Mike ? Who is going to leak this first ? [ Chattering ] [ Tara ] With only eight of you up there , it 's crucial everyone lends a hand . Yeah , we 're all workin 'side by side , you know ? Something 's going on . That 's supposed to be Paula up there , isn 't it ? [ Tara Continues , Faint ] One down . [ Tara ] All of us back on Earth are rooting for a speedy recovery . [ Maddux Narrating ] We 're astronauts . Hey . Another round , please . I 'm fine .

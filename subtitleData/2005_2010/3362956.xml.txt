 Torchwood . outside the Government , beyond the police . Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race . The 21st century is when everything changes , and Torchwood is ready . Mike , did you hear that ? Someone 's in the living room ! - Are you gonna go in there ? - Are you ? - Emergency , which service ? - Police . My name 's Beth Halloran , I 'm at 114 Brodsky Gardens . I think there 's a burglar in the flat , come quickly . - Come on ! - Mike ! Mike ! Sit down ! - of them ! My husband 's been injured , send an ambulance ! Get the TV stuff unhooked . - just take whatever you want ! - Keep her quiet . Wait , wait . Did you hear that ? What is your emergency ? - What 's happening ? - Get away from me ! - What is that thing ? - Please , don 't ... Don 't ... Please ... Stop , Stop ! - I 'm sorry ! - What 's going on ? ! I 'm sorry ! No-o-o-o ! Get away ! No-o-o-o ! Tosh , what happened ? Two IC one males , one fatality , one seriously wounded after a fall from a fifth-floor window onto a police vehicle . Bloody hell ! Here you are , has he been stabilised ? Gwen , Owen , go with him to the hospital , see if he says anything . Interview the husband and wife while you 're there . Tosh , with me . Bit weird , this one . Might be one of yours . Nobody saw anything , heard anything , blah , blah , blah . Dunno why we bother asking anymore . Thanks , we 'll take it from here . If you could just wait outside . - In my opinion , the husband did it . He was expecting to be burgled . - Really ? Yeah , look . No other reason I can think of for keeping sports equipment in the bedroom . 0h , you should come round to my house for a game of hockey sometime . - Making friends ? - Not really . What have you got ? No glass inside , so it was definitely broken out . Police say the stab wounds were caused by some long , narrow blade . Which that isn 't . No other weapons in the room could have done this . So how the hell did they manage it ? Husband was unconscious , and the wife probably weighs less than I do . - I can 't see either of them doing this . - you 'd be surprised what you can do . I didn 't see anything . We all heard this weird noise , then the next thing I know , I 'm in the corner and he 's just sitting there , dead . - The other one was just gone . - And then what ? Nothing . I just stayed there till the police arrived . I couldn 't move . I should have checked on Mike . Don 't be silly . You did the right thing . I 'm fine . Be quiet , you . The doctor said you should rest . I don 't think the doctor meant my mouth . Actually , he did , he was very specific . He said , ' No talking for a whole week . ' Lies , lies ! Why so many lies ? ! OK , thanks for your time . We 'll let you get some rest now . - Not a trace of blood on their hands , either of them . - Then who did it ? - She did , obviously . - Why obviously ? Well , look at her . It 's OK . Yeah , I can see what you 're saying , he 's absolutely terrified . It 's always the one you least suspect . Hubby 's out cold , and she survives while two burglars get mangled ? - She did it , she must have . - How ? - I haven 't worked that bit out yet . - Ah , I see , I see . All right then , jessica Fletcher , who dunn it ? The husband . His wife 's in danger , he has a cricket bat under the bed . - You fill in the blanks . - Right , OK . So , he kills one man , wearing gloves , and then he swallows the murder weapon and the gloves , and then he knocks himself out ? - Something like that , yeah . - To be continued . - Yeah ? / It 's me . Anything ? - No , nothing . They 're completely clear . Well , one of them did it , we just need to figure out how . Stay with the burglar all night if you have to . Keep an eye on those two . - OK , fair enough . - Tosh ... That was Jack . He says that you should stay with the burglar , and find out if he knows anything , all night , if you have to . I know . - And keep an eye on the other two . - Brilliant . Brilliant . Oh , will you get me a coffee before you go ? Yeah , course . What are team mates for ? You haven 't got a pound for the machine , have you ? Hospitals . They have to fall apart before anyone fixes them . - Pound . Coffee . - Thank you ! Oh , you 're safe , all right ? You 're safe , just tell me who did this to you . The woman ... .. in the flat , keep her away from me ! Page the doctor . Can you move , please ? We need to lie him down . Start Charging , now ! - Tell me everything . - Where am I ? - Where 's my husband ? - He 's safe . - What do you mean , safe ? What have you done with him ? - Nothing yet . Tell me what happened in the flat , Beth . It had to be you or Mike , so how did you do it ? You can 't treat people like this . I 've been burgled , attacked ! I want a lawyer , I want a phone call . - If you 're charging me ... - We 're not charging you . We don 't have to . There 'll be no lawyer , no phone calls , just us , and this room for as long as it takes . Now , tell me what happened ! I told her ... and the police . Please , I don 't know anything ! Look at them . The second one just died in hospital . 'Keep her away from me , the woman in the flat . ' Those were his dying words . Why would he say something like that ? ! I don 't know , I swear . I never touched him . - Is it Mike ? Are you covering for him ? - No ! Jack ? Beth , we know these men attacked you and your husband . Now , if you fought back , people will understand . It was self-defence . I promise ... I promise I have no idea what happened to them . All I know is that it wasn 't me . 'just us and this room for as long as it takes ? ' Terrifying . - Really ? - Absolutely . Shivers down my spine . - You don 't look scared . - Oh , it ... passed . - Tosh , anything on the body scan ? - Nothing out of the ordinary . - What about the light ? Power surge ? - Nothing from us . There was an electro-magnetic build-up around her , but how did she cause it ? Same thing happened at the hospital . Can 't be a coincidence . It 's her , I know it is . - OK , let 's do some tests , see who or what we 're dealing with . - I 'm on it . What kind of tests ? just little things to clear this all up . Blood samples ... Blood samples ? I haven 't done anything ! Look . .. I believe you , but this is our job . Something strange happened at your flat . We 've gotta make sure you had nothing to do with it . - I didn 't . - Then you 've nothing to worry about . They 're doing these tests whether you like it or not . Don 't make this any harder on yourself . Come on . This is where you work ? Yep . Cosy , isn 't it ? Who are you people ? Don 't you have any windows ? It wouldn 't really be in keeping with the whole secrecy thing , people looking in . - We don 't sniff the sub-etheric resonator . - Sorry . It 's so big . - This is crazy . - Yep . I suddenly feel very , very small . Come on . Let 's just get these tests done . Then you can get home , OK ? - Come on , Owen . - We 'll start with a few blood tests , nothing to worry about , just a little ... needle . - What ? - Needle 's snapped . - Haven 't you got a nurse to do this ? - He 's a doctor . It 's OK . I 'm not gonna do this if you can 't even ... What are you doing ? - Bear with me . - Hey , hey ! When was the last time you were in hospital , Beth ? I don 't remember . I don 't think I ever have . Why , what 's wrong with me ? - Any operations ? Checkups ? - No , nothing . When was the last time you felt ill ? You had a cold ? I don 't think I ever have . I take a lot of vitamin C. Mm , hell of a lot I reckon . OK , Beth . You make light bulbs blow , we can 't break your skin . What planet are you from ? Earth . Stop wasting our time ! We know you 're an alien ! There 's no such thing as aliens . Beth , janet . janet , Beth . - What is it ? - It 's an alien . But you know that cos you are , too . No , it 's not . I 'm not . I work in an office ... Why do you give off electro-magnetic waves ? Why ? ! I don 't know ! Stop it ! Why are you doing this ? ! I want Mike . I want to go home . Why is it doing that ? I don 't know . It 's never done it before . - This is real , isn 't it ? - Yeah . I don 't know about my skin , or any of that other stuff . I just ... How can I prove it to you ? How can I ... prove to you ... that I 'm not an alien ? - You said we weren 't allowed to use that again . - It 's just a mind probe . - Remember what happened last time we used it ? - That was different . That species has extremely high blood pressure . 0h , right , their heads must explode all the time . Jack , You can 't do this . What if you 're wrong ? - If she 's human , it 'll kill her . - I 'm not wrong . - We have to find out what she is . - Take it easy , Jack . - Stop at the first sign of trouble . - Or the first sign of exploding . Gwen ... bring her up . OK . Hey ! - Not too tight , is it ? - It 's fine . - Are you sure this is safe ? - Yep . just try not to , you know , kill me , or anything , OK ? You 'll probably get dehydrated during the probing . Thank you . - We 're all set . - The probe drills down through your consciousness , so if there 's anything hidden , it 'll pop to the surface . Will it hurt ? Yeah . Your bedside manner 's rubbish . You should see his manners in bed , they 're atrocious . So I 've heard . 0h , they are . I remember this ... - All right , we all ready ? - I suppose . OK , we 'll do this slowly . Tosh will controlthe probe , Owen will make sure you 're not in danger , Ianto will have more water when you need it , and I 'll be right here , OK ? What about him ? What does he do ? I 'll be watching . Are you ready , Beth ? All right . OK , Tosh . Human . - Safe . - Who killed the burglars , Beth ? I don 't know ! I ... Ah ! - Safe . - What planet are you from ? I 'm human ! 0h , God , it hurts ! - Please , please , stop ! - Go deeper . - Are you sure ? She ... - Do it ! Vital signs are all over the place , but still safe . Getting electro-magnetic build-up again . Who killed those men ? ! I don 't know ! Make it stop ! - That 's it , come on ! - Go deeper . - Safe . - Deeper ! Something 's happening to the lights ! - The electro-magnetic pulse is off the scale . - She can 't take much more ! Jack , we 've got to stop this ! Oh , my God ! I wouldn 't get that close . Toshiko , what happened ? Hit a buried compartment . Locked away . She couldn 't have been aware of it . - Who are you ? - Kayehla janees , putaak graszh , ish nin fas du hap vac nal . - Where are you from ? - Kayehla janees , putaak graszh , ish nin fas du hap vac nal . How do you like my boots ? Kayehla janees , putaak graszh , ish nin fas du hap vac nal . Jack , what is it , what is she saying ? Name , rank , serial number , and that 's all she 's gonna say . How do you know ? Cos I know who she is and why she 's here . - Switch off the probe . - Off . 0h , you weren 't lying , that really hurt ! Did you find anything ? She 's a sleeper agent . It all clicked when I saw the implant . A sleeper agent ? Who for ? No-one knows very much , they don 't leave survivors . Official designation is Cell 114 . They infiltrate planets , adapting their bodies , gathering intelligence , sometimes for years , watching , until they 're ready to take over . OK , that 's ... creepy . If we 're lucky , she 's the first . They send an advance guard to gather intel . Given false memories so they blend in . She has no idea she 's not human . Her real self must have taken over briefly , killed the burglars . - Self preservation . - Told you she did it . Yeah , The point is , by the time they attack , they know every single thing about the planet . Tosh . The implant gathers information . Normal X-rays don 't show it . She 's projecting a false image . It 's got all this data stored inside it . This is a force-field generator . it creates an impervious layer above the skin , just a nanometre thick . - That 's why you couldn 't get the needle inside her . - Right , well ... God , look , they even know about us . They know more about this place than I do . Nobody knows more than I do . What if there 's more of them ? What are we gonna do about this ? For a start ... I think we should tell her . Kayehla janees , putaak graszh , ish nin fas du hap vac nal . - Where are you from ? - Kayehla janees , putaak graszh ... Can you turn it off , please ? - So I killed those men ? - Yes . And I 'm a mass-murdering alien ? - Yes . - My whole life ... all my memories , they can 't be fake . I know I love Mike ... - and he loves me . - He does , and you do . - So what 's real ? - You both are , you both fell in love . That happened . Do you feel human ? - Yes . - Yes . Well , then you are . What makes us human ? Is it our minds or our bodies ? And what happens when the disguise comes off ? I want to have kids one day . Is feeling human ... enough for that ? Can you fix me ? Can you make me human ? No . Eventually , you 'll activate . Your real memories will come back , and Beth will disappear . What do you mean , activate ? Once you gather enough information , you 'll send it back home , and start the invasion . There must be something you can do . All this technology , everything you do here ... You can 't keep me locked up next to that thing ! - Are you gonna kill me ? - No . No , of course we 're not . Have you killed other aliens ? Only when we 've had to . When it was the last resort - kill or be killed . I wish this wasn 't happening . I 'd never know . I 'd just live a normal life . - Until the day ofthe attack . - I won 't do anything ! I 'm not that person ! I 'm sorry , but you are . We can 't let her go , she 's too dangerous . We could freeze her . Use the alien cryogenics . Wake her up if we figure out how to stop her memories from coming back . - Freeze her ? For how long ? - As long as it takes . - At least she 'd be alive . - Her implant would still gather information . - Can 't we deactivate it ? - I can isolate the transceiver and fry it in an EM pulse . Right now It 's not sending or receiving anything now . I 've checked it five times on every frequency . Won 't that let them know we 're onto them ? No . If we freeze her , she 'll never activate and they 'll never know . What about her husband ? She 'd have to disappear completely . No goodbyes . We had a holiday booked . Nothing special , just a weekend away . - Am I ever gonna see him again ? - I don 't know . 0h , those men ... 0h , my God , those poor men ! What 's happening ? ! The real memory is coming back , destroying the fake human persona . The sooner we do this , the better for everyone . Beth ? Beth , come on . Promise me something , if you can 't figure out how to keep me human , don 't wake me up . just turn the machine off . That 's not a promise I can keep . OK , you then . I bet you can . - just don 't let me hurt anyone . - You have my word . It 's funny , I 've always had this nagging feeling like I didn 't fit in . just ... so desperate to have a more exciting life . - I 'm going to hit the transceiver with an EM pulse . - You won 't feel anything . It won 't harm you . It 'll take out the force-field generator too so I 'll have to fry them both . Do it . I don 't want to be invincible . After that I 'm gonna sedate you , then we 'll freeze you . It 'll be just like going to sleep . Only a bit colder . - Bye , Gwen . - Bye . Done . 'If you want the whole bloody seat to yourself , be my guest . 'In fact , ' I said , 'why don 't we ask the other passengers to get off , 'and you can have the whole carriage to yourself ? Would you like that ? ' - You didn 't ! - I did . I was really loud , too . I couldn 't help it , I was just really annoyed . So then ... So then , right , she gives me the dirtiest look , right , and she ... David ? What is that ? ! What 's happened to your arm ? Hey ! Where are you going ? David , you 're scaring me ! What are you doing ? What 's happening ? Come back here ! David ! It 's done . I 'm sending her down to the vault . - Can somebody tell me what the hell is going on ? - 0h , shit ! - What happened ? - Beth 's gone . - I thought she was frozen ! - She was ! Her vitals were at zero . - Checking systems , command history ... - What did she do ? Is it a virus , a lockdown ? - No , she just turned off the lights . - What is it with her and light bulbs ? - She went through the tunnels . - Time to change the locks again . She knew everything about this place , it was all in her arm . The tunnels , layout , security codes . She could 've shut us down , blown us up , anything ! - She didn 't . - I swear she was frozen . - Tosh , you switched off the transceiver ? - Yes . - Are you sure ? - Well , I was until you asked . - Unless there was another false image . - Hang on , hang on . Everything about her was a lie . All of her vital signs were a false image . She can fool the equipment , tell it what we 're expecting to see , so she gets scared and it projects an increased heart rate , we try and freeze it and it does the opposite . Simulating that much information would need a huge amount of energy . - No wonder she had a big electro-magnetic field . - That 's why the lights blew when she got upset . So , what 's she doing ? Did we activate her ? She couldn 't be activated . If she was , we 'd all be dead . We took her off the network . She has some other agenda . Hey . How are you feeling ? What 's going on ? Nobody will tell me anything . - You all right ? - I 'm fine . Listen , you know I love you , don 't you ? Course I do . I love you , too . - Do you promise ? - Why ? I just had to be sure . I have to go away . What do you mean ? Where ? I can 't tell you , but it 's for your own good . Beth , what are you talking about ? No . I 'm sorry . I just ... I have to stay away from you . If I don 't ... I 'm gonna end up hurting you . Well , this is hurting me . Don 't go . Whatever happens ... just know that I love you ... and I always will . If you 've ... If you 've done something , I don 't care , - just don 't leave me . We 'll get through this . - No , not this time . I have to put things straight , and I can 't do that anywhere near you . - I love you too much for that . - Don 't let the police take you ! I 'm not gonna let you go . I don 't care what it is , I don 't care what ... - What was that ? - I don 't know . It sounded like ... He ... Help ! Help ! Somebody , get a doctor ! Help ! - Somebody ! - What are ... Somebody ! - Beth ! - Sorry ... I was just ... It was an accident , I just wanted to say goodbye ... She 's got a weapon system built into her arm . Clear . It 's getting worse . She 's losing control , we need to contain her fast . Come on , Beth . Let 's get you back . - No ! No ! - Come on ! Come on ! Get up ! Go . So , what else happened at school today ? - Alex has got a girlfriend . - Oh ? - Have not ! - Have too . - She 's called jessica . - I 'm gonna kill you so much . - Patrick Grainger ? - Alex , don 't kill your sister . Not before tea anyway ! Patrick ? 0h , my God , stop it ! Get away from him ! Oh , no ! Please , don 't hurt my children ! No , please ! Oi ! Fuckflap ! Get back in that truck or I 'll shove it up your arse ! 0h , shit ! Tosh ? We got her . It 's all over . We 're on our way . You OK ? Yeah ... I think so , yeah . - What the hell was that ? - Petrol tanker . Looks like someone wanted to take out the M4 link road for some ... No ! It 's not the road . There 's an underground fuel pipeline . It 's the special fuel supply for the military , they use it in emergencies . Not any more . Hold on . I 've got a report coming through . - Patrick Grainger 's been murdered . - Who ? Leader of the Council , stabbed several times in the chest , and once in the forehead . - Sound familiar ? - Why would anyone want to kill him ? He 's also the city co-ordinator . Takes charge of the city during major emergencies , - has all the security protocols . - How do you know that ? I know everything . And it says so on the screen . They 're putting all the pieces in place . Gwen , take her . Tosh , Owen , it 's starting , it 's happening right now . Tosh ? It 's not just her . She 's part of a cell , and they 've activated . It 's happening . - Tell me how to stop it ! - It can 't be . - Think ! - Beth , look at me . Look at me ! - How do we stop this ? - I don 't know . I 'm cut off from the cell . I don 't know what the mission is . I 'm sorry . What about your implant . How did you get out of Torchwood ? The technology is part of me . I can switch it on , I can use the tools . Can you do that now ? Can you trace the other cell ? ! No ! What if it goes wrong ? If you don 't , Beth , other people will die . Not just Mike . There 's only one left . - I can track him . - Let 's go . Come on . Hang on , I 've got an idea . No . I can 't just hook something up ! The entire telephone network is down ! - What about a mobile connection ? - The entire telephone network is down ! Mobiles , landlines , tin cans with bits of string . Everything . Absolutely everything . All phones broken . Hello ? Anyone there ? No , cos the phones aren 't working . - What 's that ? - CB radio . They knocked out the phones , but they can 't knock out the radio waves . Not yet , anyway . - What about we try ... - There is no way of getting in touch with Jack ! - No way ! - Tosh , Owen , can you hear me ? Jack ; - Thank God . What happened ? - There 's a cell , it 's active . Four including Beth , two are dead . We 're tracking the last guy now . - If we can get to him , we can stop this . - What can I do ? He 's heading for an abandoned farm outside the city . I need to know what 's there . Where the hell 's he going ? There 's nothing there ! Nothing on the surface . - He 's nearly there , we need to hurry . - Hurrying , thank you . - What happens when it starts ? - How do you get in the heavy weapons ? I don 't know . I think we just have this arm stuff . How do you manage to take over so quickly ? I don 't know . I didn 't even know how to use this thing until today . This is as far back as they go . There used to be a coal mine in the cliff . The army sealed it off in the ' 40s , doesn 't say why . Let me see if I can get into the military files . Come on , guys , that wasn 't even difficult . You disappoint me . It 's almost obscene what you do to security systems . - 0h , God . / What is it ? - The mineshaft . The military are using it for storage . Nuclear warheads . Ten of them . - Nobody 's supposed to know , not even us . - That 's how it starts . - No heavy weapons . - Exactly . They don 't need any ! They use our own against us . We left the key under the doormat . All you need is to walk in and take over . - Tell me you can stop it . - Going as fast as we can . If we don 't , we won 't feel a thing . We 're at the centre of the blast radius . - That 's comforting . - Come on , have a little faith ! With a dashing hero like me on the case , how can we fail ? He is dashing , you have to give him that . - And what if they can 't stop it ? - They 'll stop it . - Yeah , but if they can 't ? - Then it 's all over . Let 's all have sex . I thought the end of the world couldn 't get any worse . Halt ! Stop the vehicle ! Get out ofthe vehicle now ! Lie face down on the ground ! 0n the ground or we shoot ! Fire ! - Have we thought this part of the plan through ? - This isn 't gonna be pretty , brace yourselves . - How are we going to stop him , Jack ? - Like this . This wasn 't supposed to happen today . How do we stop it ? Gwen ? Gwen ! It doesn 't matter . You can 't stop us . We know what your weakness is . We know who you are , Jack Harkness . We know all about you , and Torchwood . We got a lot of information before you switched her off . You 'll be factored into our plans . - Gwen ? - Nearly there . I 've got it . He 's done . Don 't bother , your transmitter 's dead . - So is your force-field . - You 're lying . 0h , yeah ? Factor that into your plans . Now , when are the others coming ? They 're already here . I won 't let you take me . Run ! It 's done . - I 'll do it , but I 'm not happy . - Just do what you have to . We 're set with the cryogenics when you 're ready . Will it work this time ? Tosh has reconfigured the casket . It 'll work around the implant . - No more false images . - If we 'd been one minute later We weren 't . - We stopped him . - What happens when you have to stop me ? - If the freezing doesn 't work ? - It won 't come to that . I can feel it coming . It 's pushing me out . What will you do when I lose my last bit of me ? We will figure something out , Beth . No , we won 't . I 'm too dangerous for that , we both know it . Do you ... have someone ... at home ? A fiance . Have you ever hurt them ? More than once , yes . Remember how guilty you felt ? Imagine that ... times a billion ... all the time ... every second of the day . That 's how I feel now . And the worst part is , when I turn back , I won 't feel guilty any more . I 'll want to carry out my mission . I won 't even care about Mike . I 'll forget all about him . I don 't wanna die as one of those things , Gwen . - I don 't wanna forget about Mike . - Then don 't . Let 's do this . Who knows what we 'll be able to do in a month ? A year ? Thanks for being so good to me . Remember me the way I am now . Remember ... Beth . Beth ... Beth ... I won 't let you freeze me ! I 'll kill you all ! Let her go ! Let her go ! No ! Wait , wait , wait , don 't shoot ! It 's a trick . She won 't hurt me . Move away from her now ! Everybody , calm down ! Beth ... .. you don 't want to do this . Let Gwen go . I 'll kill her first , then all of you , then the rest of your miserable species ! Beth , please ! They will kill you . You have proved to be better than that , you helped us to stop the invasion . You can be human . Please ! - Not human enough . - Beth . Goodbye , Gwen . Good luck . She wanted you to shoot her ! She used her last shred of humanity to do this . We couldn 't take that chance . She must have known that . She did . She just wanted to make it easier for us . Do you think we stopped it ? Maybe . Maybe we 've just put it off for a while , I don 't know . - We don 't know anything . - We know plenty . We know about the implant . We can disable their force-field . We know how they attack . We know that they can be killed . While they think they have the element of surprise , we know they haven 't . But , until that day , we just keep doing what we do . 0h , them be fightin ' words , they be , Gwen . - So , have you set a date ? - Oh , don 't get me started , please . My mam 's already been on the phone , saying , 'What about the local church ? It 's ever so lovely . ' Go home . Keep doing what we do . Good night , Jack . He 's a frozen soldier from 1918 . - We have to wake him up every 12 months . - Leave me alone ! - It 's me . Toshiko . - Is it time again ? Two different times should never exist simultaneously . You shouldn 't be here ! Chunks of 1918 will start to appear at the hospital . We 've got a few ghosts . I think you 'd better come with us . He needs to be in the hospital , ready to step from one time to another . - You 're the only one who can stop this . - Why me ? ! It 's not years in the future . It 's now .

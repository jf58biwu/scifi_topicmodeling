 Dr King allowed DS Holt to see the image of his own death . Is he deliberately trying to sabotage the team ? The images aren 't random . Some other being has to be behind it . One of the images was taken directly by your own satellite . - It appears so . - How ? I don 't know . This isn 't about solving crime or keeping people alive . It 's about your ego . Do you know this man ? Have you noticed him hanging around ? No . If you see him , ring me immediately , OK ? What if it 's my investigations that are somehow triggering it ? Which is the bigger risk ? Do something or do nothing ? No ! It 's not enough to charge him . I 've got a role to play here . I 'm beginning to understand that . This isn 't justice . Christian . Hello ? You should come in . - Why 12 images this time ? - Why seven last time ? You still haven 't figured that out ? Do they all point to the same thing ? Could one of them be random , like last time ? That body 's carbonised . Takes a serious fire to do that . - We could be looking at arson . - What makes you think arson ? I 've got one of those in the car boot . Petrol canister . Petrol fire ? - Charred body ? Arson ? - Elementary . What 's your problem ? A more rigorous approach would be to positively identify each individual image before constructing a story . It 's not a story . It 's what 's going to happen . You 're a policeman . You gather pieces of evidence and turn them into a story you can tell in court . - That may not be the best method ... - Are you saying I fake cases ? - You misunderstand . - Arson is a possibility . - What about this body ? - Jumped ? To avoid the fire ? OK , we have two bodies and a fire . In 16 hours and eight minutes ... if we don 't stop it . Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! What are you doing ? She won 't stop . Why won 't she stop ? It 's just a phase . She 'll grow out of it . - What if she doesn 't ? - She will . - I can 't do this any more . - Of course you can , love . I 'll take her . There you go . There you go . You just need a break . That 's all . - What is that , a bit of cloth ? - Curtains ? Pyjamas . You have a strange taste in nightwear . That 's a hydrant marker . Do you think those numbers would give us a location ? - Callum ? - What 's this code mean ? Accounts ? An invoice ? That is a lot of money . Could it refer to a cash transaction ? - Money 's a motive for arson . - Money can be a motive for anything . - Bank ? Post Office ? - You 're thinking criminal link ? It would be nice if there was . It 's four in the morning . I have been worried sick ! It is practically daylight . What have you been doing ? Like you care Of course I care , I 'm your mother . - You 've been smoking . - No . - Don 't touch me ! - This has got to stop . You do know it 's my last exam tomorrow , don 't you ? Can I go to bed now ? OK , we have a serial number . - Cross-ref it with ... - Yeah . Do not duplicate . That 's a high-security key . Vaults , safety-deposit box . ID the make . Find out how many security companies are using it . If we ID the key , we can work out what it opens . That looks like some sort of reflective surface . A window , a glass ? Door ? Could those be buildings ? - Get Christian to enhance it . - I can ask . Right , well , at least we have a partial address . I 'll check this one out . And this . Another one , Spock . Oh , that I like , that I like very much . That note 's part of a 200-grand haul from an armed robbery , as yet unrecovered . - What robbery ? - Post Office , Travers Road . They had a cash top-up that day . We got some numbers . It 's one of Tony Gooding 's jobs . I thought we didn 't know that for sure . Knowing and proving are two different things . We know it was Gooding . But do we ? I don 't want you going off-piste again . I 'm not . It 's a link to a robbery . I know somebody who can tell me about it . If this does take us to Tony Gooding , you can sign me up to Operation Talisman till pension day . Any idea what this is ? - It 's a cross-section of metal . - What kind of metal ? - Can you be more specific ? - No . Can you find out ? That 's the image that was taken by your satellite . Could it have taken all these images ? No . The varying resolutions and perspectives make that inconceivable . Prometheus II is solely designed to take high-resolution photos - of the terrain beneath it . - Who for ? The Ministry of Defence . Could they be controlling it ? I would have said that 's ... impossible , but then so 's receiving images from the future . Morning , Derek . How are you doing ? Nice to see ya . What do you want ? Just a wee chat . Pass the time of day . Come back later ? Now ? I ain 't done nothing . That doesn 't sound like the Derek I know . Where 's the money from the Travers Road job ? - What ? - The robbery . I know Gooding pulled it . You know what happened to the cash . - Look , mate , you 've got the wrong idea . - No , I 've got the right idea . How 's your brother ? How 's his wife ? She 's all right . You would know , eh ? What have you got ? A lead on the cash , and it takes us straight to Tony Gooding . - How ? - He 's laundering the money today . I want to pull him . - The images show cash , not Tony Gooding . - We know we 're looking for stolen money . We know Gooding 's the guy that stole it . Plus he 's got form for arson . This isn 't about an arrest , Ben . This is about following the money . Surveillance , then . - Unless you 've got anything better . - Surveillance only . Yeah . That is one of your keys . Do you keep a record of who you supplied it to ? Yeah ? Great . No . No , that 's all I 've got . 584 . I see . No , no , I understand . It was worth a shot . Thanks . This image ... the one that came through last week . When 's it going to happen ? - What ? - It came through for a reason . Why does there have to be a reason ? - It could simply be random . - No . - Corrupted data , noise ... - You don 't understand . There is a purpose . - Mr Hudson . - Yeah ? DI Flint . Do you recognise this ? Yes , it 's from me daughter 's school . - What 's it about ? - Don 't know . I haven 't received any letter . Can I talk to your daughter ? I 'm not the one to ask . - Who is the one to ask ? - Her mother . Where would I find her ? I 've no idea . Well , you must have an address . Why would I want to see her again ? - No idea . - What about these numbers ? - Don 't they give you a location ? - Not them . That is the diameter of the main and that 's how far it is from the sign . There 's a location code above them . - Have you got the rest of the picture ? - No . Do you know how many water hydrants there are - in the Greater Manchester area ? - No . Thousands . Can Prometheus do more than take photographs ? What do you mean ? Of course not . Why ? Has the MoD got something on that satellite that I don 't know about ? No . Absolutely not , no . Well , you designed it , you saw it being built . We both watched it launch . For the MoD to somehow sneak something onto the payload ... it 's impossible . Ridiculous . The only link with Prometheus is through my control room ? - Yeah . - You can guarantee that ? Yes , I can . Christian , if you need to talk something through ... I wouldn 't do it here . I 've had too much time off as it is . I 've got to go . Yeah , I 'll manage . You 'll be all right with her on your own ? I 'll be fine . I 'll be back as soon as I can . I 'm going to work . I have to . - OK . - I 'll call you . What time did they come in ? 2.27 am . That 's one of the images from the last incident . Hm . Simon tells me it was taken by Prometheus . How is that possible ? I was wondering whether or not you might be able to answer that question . What do you mean ? I just need you to honour that cheque . Change the limit . Just a couple of grand for a few days . But I need ... Look ... OK , look . I realise this isn 't your fault . I just need that money to be in that account . - Morning , Mr Bennett . - Morning . Any messages ? The Marshalls cancelled their Aspen trip . - Did they ? Thank you . - Mr Bennett , I was just wondering ... This month 's payment still hasn 't come through . Really ? I don 't like to , you know , it 's just it 's been almost two weeks . No , you 're quite right to raise it . - It 's just I 've got to pay my rent . - Of course you have . - Take this for now . - Thanks . Ah , er ... it 's Bennett . Still on for today , are we ? My husband and I , we 've had some problems . It 's been ... well , it 's been a difficult time . This is a very serious incident . It wasn 't an excuse ... or an explanation . Be that as it may , Mrs Hudson , we have a clear code of discipline at St Dominic 's . This is formal notice of Dionne 's ten-day suspension . The thing is , I have an exam today , this afternoon . It 's not something I can ... If you like , Dionne can remain on school premises under supervision for the remainder of the day . Thank you . So , do you know what colour you want ? I 'm thinking a dark one , black or something ? That 's cool . Yeah , I think dark colours look good . Hi . What is it this time ? Here . One you can keep . Why do you keep coming here ? What do you really want ? He 's just the one you need to watch out for . So you keep saying , but what 's he got to do with me ? I can 't tell you . Well , in that case , I think you should stop coming round here . - You 're starting to freak me out . - I 'm sorry . That 's not what I intended ... I 've got to get this . Sarge ? Yeah , I am on my way . Weird . Yeah , it 's metal . Well , what kind ? What structure ? You want me to identify it from this ? You have some background in materials science , don 't you ? 30 years ago . I can 't show it to anyone else . Leave it with me . Dionne Hudson ? Not ten minutes ago , a formal warning of suspension . What did she do ? She set fire to a waste bin . Is Dionne suspected of a criminal act ? No , it 's a routine inquiry , but I would like to speak to her , if that 's possible . I don 't see why not . OK . Here 's Tony Gooding now . 5 ' 10 " , black leatherjacket and short , fair hair . He 's sitting on the bench now . Yeah , I 've got him . Oh , no . Callum , what is it ? I think he clocked me . Well , find a new obs ! Bollocks ! 180 grand , you get 5 % . I know that 's what we agreed , but the exchange rate at the moment ... 5 % , plus ... what you owe me goes away . Dollars or euros ? Er , it 's a mix of both . It makes it easier to bury the paperwork . - Right . - Look , Tony ... you are an entrepreneur , looking to broaden your portfolio . - I was wondering if ... - What is it you want ? I was thinking you might want to buy into the agency . No . It 's a good business , good turnover . We could make this part ... I already own you . I don 't need your business . Gooding 's handed over the cash . Go with the other guy . Yeah , I 'm on him . It 's a tie . His tie . It 's the fabric from the image . SOCA , come with me . - Ho ! - You need to come with me . I 'm part of Operation Talisman . You 're part of a major operational blunder . You overstepped both your authority and your ability . Serious Organised Crime Agency ? Serious waste of money , mate . How many arrests have you made recently ? Oh , we leave the kicking down the doors to people like you , Sergeant Holt . OK , OK ... We messed up your op . We 've been tracking Gooding for six months . It 's down to me , and I 'm sorry . But I need to know the name of the guy he was meeting . Who is he ? Oh , come on ! Who 's the money man ? Why did you do it ? There must be a reason . What were you angry about ? You don 't get on with your mum ? What about your dad ? Why did they split up ? He 's a dick . You want to burn down his house ? No . The school ? I don 't want to burn anything down . Your head thinks you 've got potential . Mum talks a lot about that . It doesn 't get you nothing . I haven 't finished with you . DI Flynn . Don 't let her out of your sight , I 'll be back . - What 's going on ? - They 've lost the key . - What d 'you mean , they 've lost the key ? - I mean they can 't find it . - Let 's break the bloody door down . - Secure access . Steel frame . - You 're joking me . - No , mate . - What about our money ? - Call-out fee . Great Jaz ... Mate ! She just can 't cope . The first one 's the worst . By the time you get your fourth , you hardly notice . Oh , thanks . I 'm worried about her . What if she takes it out on the baby ? - Get someone in to help . - Like who ? She won 't have it . - It 's her mother she needs . - Where 's she , then ? At Hyderabad . She won 't fly . Even if she would , she can 't afford it . Well , you can 't afford to go on the way you are doing . And I can 't afford to fly us all to see her mother . It 's just not worth it . - Did you authorise that operation ? - Yes , I did . In breach of every protocol going ? Time was of the essence . That 's no reason . Gooding was flagged months ago , he 's a SOCA target . You do not touch . Your vice squad knows that , your drugs squad knows that , your DCI knows that . - How come you didn 't know it ? - All I can ... Because you didn 't clear it . I 'm sorry they compromised your operation , but I want those officers back on the street now . - Why ? - Time is short . Lives are at stake . I can 't tell you more , we 're covered - by the Official Secrets Act . - You 're really clutching at straws . Er , boss ... It 's more than I expected . Well , if you can book in advance these flights are a lot cheaper . Could I pay it in instalments or something ? Again , um , if you could have booked in advance ... Perhaps I can do a manager 's discount . What 's the point of being manager if you can 't do your best for your customers . How will that do ? An excellent example of inter-agency co-operation . Shut up . Just tell me his name . - Thanks . - I didn 't get you out . - Who did ? - What the bloody hell were you doing ? - I told you not to go after Gooding ! - I didn 't . You lost track of our best lead by going off - with some self-righteous ... - No , I didn 't . The money guy , his tie was the same pattern and colour as the cloth in the image . Callum ? Yeah . We 'd be all over him now if it wasn 't for that serious piece of shit . I know this matters . Dionne Hudson , 14 , female , IC4 , 4 ' 8 " , last seen wearing a school uniform , navy-blue blazer . If her name crops up in connection with any kind of incident , I want to know immediately . - She 's gone . - What ? The girl , done a runner . Receptionist was supposed to be keeping an eye on her . We 'll pick her up at home . No address , no number , she hadn 't told the school she was moving , they haven 't even got a mobile number for her . So we 've lost track of the money and Dionne . We 've got four-and-a-half hours and no leads . So what now ? We look for something else . Holly 's nail salon . It 's DC Gada . - Callum . I ... - I told you to stop hassling me . - I know , but ... - Are you even a copper ? Of course I am . So , if I ring of the local nick and ask for DC Gada , they 'll put me through to you , will they ? - I 'm not there at the moment . - Right . Sonia , please , don 't hang up . The man in the photograph , he 's dangerous . We can 't charge him . Who can 't ? You have to believe me . I 've been told to protect you . I 've had enough of this . Don 't call me again . Oh , takes me back . What are you testing ? Differentials ? Got something ? Section of aluminium alloy 7075T6 , low-res image , round times 80 . Uses ? Highly stressed structural parts , often used in aerospace and defence applications . And bike frames . That might be significant . A corrosion bit . Something 's going to break ? What , when , where , I can 't say . Not much help . What are you doing ? Detecting the invisible . We have less than four hours . How can you see a black hole if light itself can 't escape its gravitational pull ? You can 't . All you can see is the effect it has on the objects around it . A wormhole is a distortion in space time . Theory has it you detect a wormhole the same way you detect a black hole . Anything you see through it will be distorted . So , stars will move ... - from their known positions . - You 're saying you 've found a wormhole ? I 'm saying I may have found a way of detecting one . At 8.27 tonight , two people are going to die , and you are conducting an experiment . We need to find out what those images mean . Feel free to chip in . - What have you got ? - It 's not Gooding , it 's his money man . How 's Gooding going to launder the cash ? Must need it turned round fast if he 's carrying bags of it around town . It 's a big chunk of notes , so it 's not a launderette or an amusement arcade . Bureau de change . They 're not as tight as they should be , street cornerjob , a decent turnover and a bent manager , doddle . Street corner , one-man-band travel agent . That could be a flight number . - Booking reference . - T031 ... T-O . What 's the number you need - if your travel operator goes bust ? - AITO , isn 't it ? AITO - Association of Independent Tour Operators . Run the address through . Start the car . You realise you put me in an extremely difficult position . - I haven 't got time to do this now . - I hope I don 't have to step in again . So do I. Your new role carries with it certain responsibilities . It is essential that this operation doesn 't attract the attention of other agencies . - Can we afford it ? - Don 't worry about it . I 'll have to do extra shifts , pick up what I can , but we 'll manage . - Are you sure ? - I thought you wanted a break . It 's not just getting help from your mum , it 's getting away from here . From this routine . A proper holiday for all of us . You 're important . Both of you . - You think it 's a bike part ? - It might be . 9mm diameter , aluminium 7075T6 . - How sure are you ? - I can 't quantify it . Is it worth checking out or not ? What does that look like to you ? - A strap . - Buckle . Cycle helmet . OK . Where am I dead ? The image that came through of me dead , where is that ? Where am ... I ? In the ... parallel universe that sparked into existence the moment you chose not to touch the live cable that should 've killed you , if you adhere to the multiverse interpretation . So there 's more than one of me . As far as that means anything at all ... yeah . So what does it matter whether I live or die ? Because ... Because life is all we have . The vitality of ... the universe is the only necessary god . 9mm . - Aluminium 7075 . ... T6 . Lorrayne , I 'm , er ... I 'm not in . What ? I 'm out , meeting , doesn 't matter . Whatever they want , I 'm not here . But ... Hi . DI Flint . This is DC Gada . Is your manager available ? I 'm afraid not , he 's out for a meeting . Can I help you ? Any of these frames made with aluminium 7075 ? - What are you looking for ? - Aluminium 7075 . I suppose , but to be honest , they 're all ... What 's the diameter of the tubes ? Is this an average size ? - Yeah , but ... - It 's too big . What about parts ? In aluminium ? 7075 . T6 ? Maybe I should check inventory . Maybe you should . Is it a recent booking ? I don 't know . It 's not like we 've been rushed off our feet , you 'd think I 'd remember . Oh , here . Two adults , one infant for Hyderabad , Mr Roy . - Can I take a copy ? - I should ask Mr Bennett . He 's in a meeting and I am a detective inspector . Do you run a bureau de change ? We take care of our clients foreign currency requirements , of course , but we don 't run an exchange counter as such . We haven 't got bike parts in that type of aluminium . But we 've got clips . What kind of clips ? I 'll have this , you can keep that . Sorry , I didn 't hear the door , she 's making that much noise . Police . I hear you 're planning a holiday . Neet , it 's the police . What ? What for ? - There 's nothing wrong with her . - They 're not saying there is , - they just want to ask ... - I 'm just really tired , that 's all . Of course you are , it 's the hardest thing in the world . Is she your first ? It gets easier . And it gets better . Does it ? Yeah . I 'd better go and change her . 9mm , aluminium 7075 . Fit your profile ? Yeah . There 's no mountains that close to Deansgate . Climbing wall ? An hour and 40 minutes to check out every climbing wall in the city . I 've got to find something else . Sorry to have bothered you . If those names do ring a bell , - you 've got my number . - Yeah , thanks . - I meant to ask , where do you work ? - Building maintenance firm , - rigging , repair , bit of scaff . - Are you working tonight ? No , I 'll take the little one , give Neeta a break . I hope she lets you get your head down tonight . - I only need a couple of hours , me . - Thank you . See you . It 's got nothing to do with Dionne , nothing to do with Gooding and none of them have a connection to the money . People are going to burn to death and all we know is when . We don 't know how , we don 't know where , it 's like we 're the butt of some great cosmicjoke . God doesn 't tell jokes . Maybe it 's the way he tells them . Mr Bennett ? That was the bank on the phone . Mr Bennett ? Look , I 'd better be off . Are you OK to lock up ? Mr Bennett ? We 're closed . Hiya . Can I help you ? It 's fine . It 's OK . Calm down . Calm down . - I 'm going out . - No , you 're not ! - Yes ... # I 've finished my exams . # I 'm going to get to spend more time with you . You 're lame . I 'm going to make it up to you . I 'm going to earn some real money , get us out of this squat and into a proper flat . I 'm sorry . What for ? I 'm the one who started the fire . For treating you like you 're a little girl . You 're not . You 're a young woman . New life , new rules . For both of us . Friends ? Nah , let 's not push it . Now , celebrate with your loving mother ! You can have one glass . Get a takeaway . - Chicken . - Thai . Tenner in the pot . You get the champagne , I get to choose . Chicken . That 's the moon , in its current phase , as it would appear at 8.27 . And so 's that . How does that help ? The image we received is of the moon reflected on some glass surface , possibly a door . Those look like buildings to me . Now , I know exactly what the moon 's position will be at 8.27 this evening . 26.14 degrees east , 147.08 degrees ... azimuth elevation 2.87 . You see ? Well , if we can identify the building 's silhouette in this image , we can triangulate the position of this reflection . And we have a location ? Well , assuming the reflected image is visible from ground level . It 's a leap of logic , but we have to start somewhere . Spoken like a detective . There are a limited number of buildings in the Greater Manchester area high enough to fit the silhouette . If that is a door , could it be related to the fire ? Find it . What ? Now . You have 50 minutes . Callum , drive him . It 's here . It 's the moon that pulls it all together . Just tell us where . You all right , mate ? What , they found the key ? Where was it ? Huh ! No , mate , I don 't know . It 's late . I 'm giving Neeta a ... Well , how much ? Bloody hell , are you serious ? No , mate , I ... Sure . I 'm on . They 're so desperate to seal up the electrical unit , - they 're paying triple time . - It 's half seven at night . It 's a quick job . I 'll be back before midnight . Where have I heard that before ? It 's not about the money . It 's about the holiday . I don 't deserve you . - I 'll call you . - We 'll be waiting . Best thing I could have done . Worth every penny . It takes a mother 's love . You 'll come back with a smile on your face and a bun in the oven . Don 't . Give us it , then . # Me say every Sunday morning in front of the TV # Recording with the microphone ... # This isn 't going to work . I can 't ID these buildings like this . I need a panoramic view . We need to get higher . Petrol , fire hydrant sign , letter . Crash helmet , flight booking , cash . Follow the money . The guy 's got to launder the cash . What about that bureau de change ? - Travel agent didn 't have one . - Who told you that ? Manager wasn 't there . Bennett Travel . That 's him . That 's Gooding 's money man . Come on ! Got the taller of the two buildings . Just need to find the lower one . It 's all right , this . Well , get a shift on . It might be triple time , but I don 't want to leave Neeta too long . There , stop . There , there , there , stop , stop ! Watch out ! Are you coming or what ? Got it . This is it . It 's not the image . It 's what it reflects . Building maintenance . It was work . Christian , come on . Christian ! Help ! Help ! Help ! DI Flint , Police . There 's a fire at Bennett Travel . 49 Port Street . Urgent assistance required . Callum ! It 's the guy going on holiday - he 's up the Arndale Tower . His safety clip 's going to fail . Oh , my God ! Ben ! Ben ! It 's not just him , it 's them . There are two incidents at the same time ! Mate , are you all right ? Yeah , I 'll hook onto my safety line . Mum ! Mum ! Get back ! - Mum ! - Dionne , what are you doing here ? Mum ! My mum 's in there ! My mum ! Get off me ! Mum ! Get her out ! Get her out ! Mum ! Get off me ! We 're squatting in there . Help us , please ! - We can 't use the stairs . - It 's the only way up ! Mum ! Use another clip ! Help ! Please , help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! That ladder 's too short . They need an aerial platform . You 're going to be all right . Just stay calm . No ! The only thing that 's holding him is the karabiner , and we know that 's going to fail . We need an aerial platform here now ! This is DI Flint . I need two aerial platforms . One ALP to 49 Port Street . And one to the Arndale Tower . There 's one ALPon call in the area . It takes 10 minutes for another to reach either address . Which incident takes priority ? There 's only one platform . Ma 'am ... which incident takes priority ? You 've got to call it . He 's got a baby . Please ! Fire ! Help ! Mummy ! Help ! Port Street . To Port Street . Use another clip ! Your karabiner , use another one ! Mummy ! - This time 's different , isn 't it ? - How do you mean ? It 's about us . We 've had this before . This has to be a mistake . We didn 't get Taylor the last time . We 're being told we 've got unfinished business . If I stay here , five students die . Without justice , what are we ? The decisions , the people we meet , they all lead us to the final incident . Please , God , give me the strength . Stop him ! - Jesus , Ben , what 's happened to you ? - I don 't know . Please , put the gun down . Perhaps it 's all been leading to this from the very first day .

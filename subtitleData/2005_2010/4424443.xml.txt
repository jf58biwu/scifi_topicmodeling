 the.prisoner.2009.part02 You can tell a lot about a person from their apartment . If you know how to look . Here 's to forgetting . Some things . There you are . Here . Don 't you recognize your brother ? Six ? He 's not my brother . Why would a man deny the existence of his own brother , When he 's standing right in front of you ? Because he 's sick , demented . Isn 't that what you want me to think ? Let us concern ourselves only with evidence . Brought these from home . Remember that ? Stuff could be fake . And does your flesh also lie , Six ? You fell out of a tree and cut your arm . You could have done it , while I was sleeping . Buddy , we-we just want you back , the way you were . You 're not gonna catch anything . Yes , I will- - I did last week . Perhaps therapy might work , yes ? What do you say , Six ? Give the talking cure a try . Oh , you would like that , wouldn 't you ? Meddling with my mind . What are you afraid of , Six ? A glimpse into your psyche , Discovering that you are the problem , after all ? I 'm not afraid . Come on ! Good- - the sessions are booked . A man with nothing to hide , is a man with nothing to find . Good to see you , Six . Home at last . Hey , look who it is . Hey , Uncle Six- - your not dead . Hey , good evening . Oh , it 's good to see you . - Hey , dad- - - I 've made your favorite for dinner . Barbeque pork wraps . It 's " Wonkers ! " Let 's go into the bar . Ah , see , we never miss " Wonkers . " 46-5 ... Yes . Oops , here we go . Nothing . I don 't like pork . Oh , go on- - it 's your favorite . There is something . Okay , so , 765 is in love with 23-30 , But 23-56 is pregnant to 46-5 , And 913 had an affair with 23-30 . So , 765 is jealous of 23-30 , And so she , like , took her revenge by sleeping with 46-5 . - 46-5 . - Yes . I 'm leaving you . - No- - - Yes . Oh , no ! Why ? I love your brother . You have a lovely family . I know it ... And I 'm proud of it . But it 's not real , is it ? And I 'm not your brother . My brother 's dead , and I 'm somebody else . Six , it kills me to see you like this- - Did you take anything ? - What ? - Papers from my pocket ? No . Cause maybe you work for them . I don 't know . I only know that none of this is real . If you won 't go to your therapy , Then , I will . I have to , because let me tell you , I just want my brother back . And it just kills me to Why is it so dark in here ? Why does it feel so dark to you ? Well , my home is not my home . My brother 's not my brother . Nothing 's real . And what feels real to you , Six ? Why should I tell you ? Because it bothers you ... Doesn 't it ? You can 't cure your thinking with your thinking , Six . You have to hand it over . There is something in you , Which you feel the need to find . You feel the need to resolve it . Am I right ? Let me tell you something interesting . Numbers on a phone , how they work . They have a logic , a purpose . I get the feeling this is not merely information . When you borrowed my phone , the number you dialed , It wasn 't a number . That 's pretty observant . What kind of a guy notices stuff like that ? Just someone suspicious . You didn 't make a call . There was something came into your head ? I saw a seagull this morning . Some kind of bird ? Yeah , that 's right , some kind of bird . And I got to thinking ... " Either you 're a long way from home , " Or we 're a lot closer to the beach , than I realized . " And what is " the beach ? " That 's where you go on vacation . Tell us about your vacation . Not much to tell . Me and my brother , We 'd take the train to the sea . We called it " the edge of the world . " Giant salt water rod for him . An old fishing net for me . Wait a minute- - did you say " us ? " Who 's " us ? " He is me ... We are me . I find it conducive to work in this way . I can engage . And I can reflect . I think we 're done here . Six , wait ! There 's no requirement That you share your thoughts here with me- - us . Simply to have them . Six ! Six , wait ! I met your brother . Seems like a sweet man . He spies a lot . I mean-I mean , I think he 's a worrier , And I think he 's worried about you , Six- - He 's not my brother . Six , maybe you could just accept the possibility that he is Listen to me , I am not a number . Right . There was something in my pockets . Did you take it ? No , there was nothing in your pockets , six . Six , there you are . I was thinking , " what is the one thing That helps a man not dwell on his troubles ? " Work- - huh ? Come on- - let 's go see the guys . Hey , 130 . Look who 's here . hey , welcome back . He 's lost some weight , don 't you think , boys ? Looks to me like a man who needs a beer or 12 . We 'll take you out with the boys tonight , six . Put some flesh on them bones , huh ? How do you fancy getting behind the old wheel ? Why do you think I can drive this thing ? You 're the best there is , six . But I 've never driven a bus in my life . Listen to him , boys . How ' bout you just get behind the wheel , And see if it all comes back to ya , huh ? Fire her up . Ah , as sweet as a honey nut wrap . The village tour will depart in Approximately One minute and 20 seconds . See the sights ! If you 've already seen them , see them again . - See ya - bye . Your driver today , my buddy and my brother , Number six . Coming up here , on your left , Is the village museum of modern art , Containing the famous painting of Crying 38-30 , by 794 . And then , coming up , One of the highlights of our tour , the clinic . Every day is a sunny day in the village . Moving on now , over to the corner , The newly rebuilt " solar cafe . " You were right , of course . He is resistant to the possibility of revealing the six inside . And why is that ? He feels alone . Oh ! Very good . He dreams of escape . He feels rootless . And yet , his roots are right here , Under our feet . What ails the man ? He described ... A fishing trip . Fishing ? We like six 's fishing stories , don 't we , 70 ? Some kind of fantasy . Perhaps you 'd do better Trying to find the two inside . Why not , since I 'm here . We can have a poke around . See what makes two tick . The inside two . I 'm curious . I want to know what 's going on inside of me . Let 's start ... My wife ... I 'm the reason she 's the way she is . Perhaps we should stay with the matter of six . I know I can trust you . I love my son . But , I have thoughts , If he knew me , if he truly know his father , He might not like me . Do you like me , 70 ? You are two , we all love you . But , do you like me ? I don 't really know you . I- - what I do know is that you are a wonderful man . Of course . You think I believe all of this therapy babble , do you ? My mother sat me sideways On the potty when I was a toddler , Now I want to sleep with her ? Oh , grow up , man ! Have you had sex with your mother , 70 ? No- - never . Well , don 't . Two , if I might ask , If you don 't believe in the value of the talking cure- - it 's not necessary for me to believe . It is necessary for six to believe . The sight to delights just don 't stop , folks . Actually , this is one of my favorite parts of the trip , The desert . My kids , they always say to me , " Dad , what 's beyond the desert ? " And I tell ' em , " More desert . " Around every dune , there 's another dune , right ? In a few moments , We 're gonna be pulling up for some light refreshments . 91 will be coming around with , uh , some delicious wraps . And remember , take out your cameras . This is one of the best views of the towers . Where are you going ? There 's something I wanna see . Ah , a very slight detour- - no cause for alarm . Okay , everyone , this is an unscheduled stop . Can you see it on the map ? Who can tell me what it is ? Some kind of bus that broke down ? Ah , not even close . What are you doing ? It 's an anchor . Which means , somewhere around here is a boat , Yeah , or a ship . A ship means water , and water means ocean , right ? What does ocean say to you- - anyone ? Uh , this is what 's known as a desert folly , Which means it 's a nothing . No , it 's not- - it means escape . Escape of what ? Yeah ? Come on . Something I wanna show you . Where they are going ? Will they just leave us here ? What is this place ? It 's the ruins . Were there ever trains ? I don 't get you , six . It 's the ruins- - it 's the same as it 's always been . We came here every day , when we were kids . We played soldiers , and hide-and-seek . We used to call it the " edge of the world , " remember ? How can you forget that ? Guess I do feel something , being here . I can 't-I can 't deny it . But , why ? Why should I feel belonging , When I 've never been here before ? Try to ask yourself , Do you - really think that whole family , those kids , Are living their lives just to deceive you ? Maybe . If you 're right , There 's no way out of here , then . Can 't we have life here ? Isn 't that something ? Two people , like your brother , his family- - no-no-no-no-no . That 's what they want us to think . 313 , you ever been on a boat ? Why would I ? You don 't know what you 're missing . I noticed you , sitting on your own . I decided that if I spoke to you , You might wanna get to know me . Is that so bad ? Why tonight ? Why choose the day that I resign ? Well , maybe , it 's a coincidence . Do you know the way ? Every day is a sunny day . It 's " wonkers ! " Life is short . It 's the same thing , over and over , Day in and day out . It 's like we can never escape . I 'm 16 , your guide . You driver today , my buddy and brother , number six . Coming up here , on your left , Is the village philharmonic hall . And then , coming up , One of the highlights of the tour ... The clinic . And next , today , especially for you , The home of our great patron . The one , the only , home of you know who , Palais two . " wow , " being the operative word here . Wouldn 't it be amazing if two came out right now ? Oh , he- - Much bigger than on tv . He 's coming.Okay. It 's good to see you looking so much better , six . Driving your bus around , Spending time with your brother . Family is the greatest gift the village can give us . Isn 't that right ? Hmm . Perhaps one day , you will have a son , six . I recommend it . It 's only when you have family , That you learn the meaning of love . Oh , do sit down . Are we enjoying our little sight seeing trip ? - Wonderful . - Good . And what do you think of your driver ? There , good news . One family , here on this bus , has won a holiday , To the escape resort . I have the ticket here . And the lucky family is ... 16 . Yes ! I 've always wanted to go to escape resort . Can 't wait to tell the kids . Fantastic--thank you . And that wraps up our tour for today . I bet you 're all ready for a beer , or 12 . Escape resort . You 're gonna come with us , aren 't you , six ? This resort , is it by the sea ? A sea ? Yeah , you know , the sea , the ocean , water , waves . What do you mean , the pool ? You gotta come , six . Come away with me . Life is short . So come away . You 'd never escape the guilt . 913 wouldn 't care . You would break 46-5 's heart . His wife and his own brother . I can 't let you go . You took them . No , I found them in your pocket . You fool around with me like everything 's a joke . What do you-you report on me ? Tell them what I say to you ? Why 'd you take them ? I like them . I like the idea of another place . I 'm sorry , I-I don 't wanna lose you ... Lose our friendship . I was being stupid , and look , it won 't happen again . I lied to you . You really are suspicious of people , aren 't you ? You would be too if you worked there . You haven 't told me where you work . I am- - I was an analyst for a company called " semicorp . " We collect C.C.Tv footage from around the world . I watch people , I see things . I collect data and statistics . My job is to look for patterns , How we live . Trying to find out what is going on , And finding out what is going on is not good news . Is that why you resigned ? Why do you ask ? Well , why shouldn 't I be interested in you ? Sorry , it 's what that place does to you . What you need is a distraction . You know , I watch people like us , doing things like this , And I write about them in my reports . So , if you were watching us now , what would you see ? Two people , a man and a woman in a room , For one night , 'Cause that 's all they 're capable of anymore . Please , tell me that is not true . It 's only a report- - It 's what you believe . It 's what I see . It 's ridiculous , I know , but ... I 've been lying awake , thinking , " Maybe if I came down , they wouldn 't be here . " You loved that thing . You always say that . I don 't remember it at all . Memory is fickle . Six says that everything here is fake , unreal . It 's not possible . I mean , why would the world be like that ? It is like that , in six 's mind . Look at me , 11-12 . Is this real ? Do I love you like No father ever loved a son before ? When I was your age , I questioned everything . Young men always doubt , challenge , But never doubt your family . Never . Steven , come back . Something happened , in you ... A memory . Your fishing trip , perhaps . Your brother ? Do you think it would help me to tell you ? I know it would . 765 is in love with 23-30 . 23-56 is pregnant to 46-59 . 913 had an affair with 23-30 , So 765 is jealous of 23-30 , So she He 's running rings around us ! I see your fear , 70 . I 've been watching you . You know you 're a prisoner- - you 're just like me . But you don 't wanna know . Well , I refuse to become you . I do remember something about this place . Like something happened here . Doesn 't that make it true ? They do it to me somehow . They do it to all of us . One , two ... Three , four , five ... Six . " Hello to you , who-whoever you are . " I 'm six . " I 'm eight years old . You sound like such a clever , little six . It 's a trick . You knew where it was- - you went straight to it . It has to be a trick . Has to be . Tell me why you resigned , please ? I worked on a floor called " analysis . " We don 't know who works on the next floor . We never see them . I started to notice something , And like a good boy , I reported up . And what was it ? People changing . Too many people . So I sent in the report , got a three-word reply . " Cease and desist . " But if you could find out why " solutions " want you to stop Who are you ? You work in " semicorp , " you said " solutions . " I didn 't say , " solutions . " No more bullshit- - who are you ? Yes , I work there . You sit there , you look at me , And you tell me why you 're here ? You think you resigned- - maybe you did , But it 's not over . They still control you . I 'm going on vacation with my brother tomorrow . You called him your brother . Do you see ? I see I need to get out of here , Before I become a part of this place . I , be seeing ya . There 's a reason I go on those bus trips . I heard the ocean once . They stopped the bus . I kind of wandered off away . I heard waves crashing . I heard the ocean . You know , I 'm all for a wild goose chase . I 'm an affirmative kind of guy , generally speaking , But , " I can hear big water ? " " Somewhere , there 's a sound of splashing ? " Please . You mind if we just shut up and drive , please ? Sounds good . It 's non-stop to the escape resort , Departing in approximately four and half minutes . - Where is he ? - I don 't know . She 's a crazy , six . Man , we are right where we were , And we were here , even before that- - And we are right here , again . Maybe it was an illusion . Maybe I never heard it . Listen to me , you did hear something . You have to keep believing that you heard it . I wish I could . I wish I could hear it now . Try . Listen . Follow the towers . Two put you up to this , didn 't he ? What ? All this talk of the ocean- - yes , he did . He wants to throw me off track . - We 're going on a trip - No , no , no , it 's today ! - Where you going , man ? - My family ! I knew you wouldn 't let us down . I told them- - didn 't I tell ya ? Six never missed a vacation in his life . Come on , what are we waiting for ? All right , everyone , We 're all gonna have a nice , normal vacation . You can 't get to the towers It 's not possible . You know that , six . Do you know the way ? Is it hot as hell in here Or is it me It really is a mystery If I die before I wake I pray the lord my soul to take my misery I could really use a drop to drink Feel like I was really in the pink I knew it was a dream when I don 't sleep I 'm slumbering There 's still a promise dreamers keep I 'm wondering Lay beyond the sea You hear me ? You gotta cut this out ! You gotta stop this ! I found something the monster wants . Something of mine from when I was a boy . I keep trying to prove I 'm right , Find a way out . But what if I am wrong ? What if I am your brother ? All you 've given me is love and kindness . I 've repaid you with cruel accusations . Maybe I am insane . I 'm sorry for all the pain I 've caused you . You 're a good man . I do trust you . I 'm glad I have a brother . Six ... I 'm not your brother . I 'm sorry ! Please , you 've gotta help me , now ! You 've gotta help me . I 'm sorry . I try to be a good father . You know , give them something good to look back on . This place , it 's what you dream of . For a guy like me , it 's out of reach . I 'm scared of them , six . They 're watching us all the time . Look at me , I 'm shaking like a leaf . Look , I need a beer . What is it they want from me ? They must have told you something . My head is so confused with confusion . I-I don 't even know if what I just told you Is true or not . The other place . Something about you talking about some other place . Are they really your family ? I don 't even know anymore . I know it sounds stupid , but , I sort of do think of you as my brother . Me , too . Six , is there another place ? There is . You gotta help me get out there . They will get me- - they 're gonna get me . No , we 'll get out first . It isn 't there , is it ? Two will know we were out here . He 'll know that I betrayed him . I promise you , we 'll find it . Steven , come back . 16 , come back . I 'm only just getting started- - come on ! Come back here ! It 's gone . I have to tell you something . Shh , uncle six- - " Wonkers " is on . Your father- - Your father 's dead ! He drowned . Yeah , well , 11-12 , none of us can choose our family . He swam in the ocean . Taste the saltwater in his mouth . Felt the power of the waves . There is a way out of this place . No matter how loudly you shout that there isn 't ! You 're the one who 's shouting , six . The louder a man shouts , The more profoundly he 's wrong . I 'm not wrong . I 'm telling you the truth . My brother is dead . Six . Saying these things about his brother- - It hurts . Only a family can heal . I didn 't mean that . I didn 't mean " my brother . " Six- - oh , six . I am not a number- - I am not a number . I am - I am- - Yes , six . My name is- - damn it ! My name is- - I am six He 's six . I am six ! That 's right . I am six- - I am six , you bastard ! Six .

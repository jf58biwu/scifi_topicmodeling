 The 4400 Season 3 Episode 6 ( 2006 ) - Graduation Day - SYNC CORRECTIONS : klepal We 're not a threat . We 're salvation . The world will have to deal with us . Previously on the 4400 ... my name is daniel armand . You know who I am ? Of the nova group ? I called to arrange a truce and to talk about shawn farrell . We need to discuss his future , because unless you and i can come to some kind of an agreement , I 'm not sure he 's going to have one . Believe me , I know which bench i dedicated to my husband and son . They died in a car accident shortly before I was abducted . Our enemies are more resourceful than we imagined , and they 've let loose a terrible evil into your time . This evil , there has to be some other way to deal with it . There is . You . ( kill isabelle ) You are the other way . Oh , tom.Good. You 're here . Yeah , just like always . Well , come on , we need to get started . Started with what ? Diana , I have no idea what you 're talking about . She 's waiting . What is this ? I brought her in.You can just do it , and we can get on with our day . " It " ? No ... no way , I 'm not ... tom , you 're supposed to do this.They told you so . I know . It 's just ... they didn 't say why . I don 't think I can.Maybe I 'm bad . Maybe I 'll kill a bunch of people . You can stop it . I could be responsible for millions of deaths , unless you do something . We 've got a lot to do today . It 's all right , tom.I don 't mind . Come on . Take the needle . Come on , tom . Do it . Do it . I 'm sorry . I can 't find it ... I can 't find the bug ... I can 't find it ... I know you 're listening . I know you put it somewhere inside of me . I 'm going to find it . I can 't find it . I can 't find the bug . I can 't find it . I can 't find the bug . Inside me somewhere . I know you 're listening . I 'm going to find it . I 'm going to get an x-ray of my whole body ... maia 's it ! Maia 's it ! I 'm going to get you , amy ! No , you won 't ! Yes , I will ! maia ... maia , are you all right ? It hurts . I can help you . It 's just a bump , shawn . I can make it better . It hurts ... you 're getting better . Hey ! Let her go ! You 're hurting her ! Somebody help ! Let go ! Help ! what 's going on ? He 's killing her ! Get him away ! Mr. Farrell , let go . Stay away from her ! I don 't understand.I was healing her . I was making her better . 4400 Season 03 Episode 06 Sweetheart ... hey , mom . How are you doing ? I 'm okay . Maia 's vital signs are fine . There 's no lasting damage that I can detect . At the moment , she 's mostly just dehydrated . Sweetheart ... mommy ? What is it ? Why ... would shawn hurt me ? Oh , my god ... shawn did this ? He missed some meetings yesterday , but I had no idea it had gotten this bad . How 's shawn ? Is he okay ? We don 't know . We called a psychiatrist for him.They 're back in the bedroom now . Well , I want to see him.He 'll feel better . Isabelle , not right now . Let him be with the doctor for a while , okay ? Sorry . This is my daughter , isabelle . Isabelle , this is tom baldwin . Shawn told me about you . Hi . Hi . You 're staring at me . Why ? How is he ? I gave him a sedative.He 's sleeping right now . Shawn is experiencing persistent and powerful auditory hallucinations . They 're contributing to his delusions . Delusions ? I don 't understand.What 's happening to him ? Shawn 's symptoms are ... well , I 'm afraid they 're consistent with the onset of disorganized schizophrenia . But you 're going to fix him , right ? You 're going to make him better . Well , I 've never seen a case quite like this . Typically , schizophrenia has a gradual onset . Patients slowly withdraw from the world as their symptoms get worse , but with shawn , it 's almost as if the disease was just turned on . Last week , we got a phone call from daniel armand . He said if we weren 't willing to reach a compromise with nova , he 'd come gunning for shawn , and now it 's two days later , and he just happens to come down with schizophrenia ? You think the nova group did this to shawn ? Well , we 'll investigate it , but until the matter is cleared up , shawn just can 't walk around free . I mean , okay , he 's probably a victim in this , but his mental state has been compromised . He can 't control his ability . Shawn is one of the leaders of this place . People love him . If he just disappears into the basement at ntac , there 's going to be a lot of unhappiness around here . Nobody 's talking about disappearing anyone . You need to just distance yourself from the situation just for a second . Now , we have an insane 4400 with a potentially lethal ability . This is an ability that has turned against my daughter . If you don 't voluntarily remand him to a psychiatric hospital , then I 'll file a complaint for assault . And take the decision out of your hands . No ! You can 't lock him up.This isn 't his fault . Isabelle , shawn is in trouble.He needs help . I know he does , and instead , you just want to abandon him ? He sacrificed for this place . He told you not to talk to nova , even if it meant they were going to come after him . Now they did , and you just want to cut himoose ? We 're not cutting him loose , we are protecting him . Oh , by locking him up ? Isabelle ... that is not true , and we are not having this discussion now . This is not the place . If you 'll agree that shawn goes nowhere near a government facility , we 'll commit him to a private hospital until all this is cleared up . How much did they tell you about what I do here at the school ? Um , not much . You 're some sort of guidance counselor , right ? I 'm something like that . It 's more like a therapist , I guess you could say . I work with the students here using my ability . All the kids here are 4400s , which means you missed years of your families ' lives . Your parents had another child while you were gone , your brother curtis ? Yeah , before they got divorced . I barely know him . That 's where I come in . It 's hard to explain , but if you let me , I can take you back to the years when you were gone . You can meet your brother when he was a baby , see him grow up , and spend all the time you need with him , and build the relationship you don 't have . Um ... I 'm sorry . What , you want to take me back in time ? No . We go into a world we create using both our minds , and it will seem just as real as this one . Look , uh ... no offense ... but maybe you should worry about helping yourself . You think I need help ? You have this ... sadness inside you . Not sadness , exactly . I guess " rage " would be the best word . It 's because of what happened to your husband and son all those years ago . You know about billy and paul ? They got killed in a hit-and-run . The police never caught the guy . You try to move on , and , uh ... I guess you kind of have , but you still think about it every day . And ... and there 's still that rage . How ... how do you know all that ? Well , you have an ability ... and I have an ability . Look , uh ... I 'm sorry ... I 'm just not up for this . So , uh ... is it okay if I go back to class ? You 're right to be mad , you know . The guy ? The driver ? He 'S ... kind of out there . It 's not fair . But you did see shawn farrell on tuesday ? A home loan from the center . And how did the meeting end ? Oh , well , congratulations . That 's a really nice neighborhood . No , no , mr . Donovan , thanks for your time . We 'll be in touch if we need anything further . You know , your nephew is one of the leaders of the center . He sees dozens of 4400s every day , and the ones we 've spoken to who have registered abilities with us , they have minor stuff . Nothing like the capacity to induce insanity , and that 's assuming that whoever did this had to be in proximity to shawn to make it happen . " Whoever " ? We basically know who did this.It was daniel armand . Either he did it , or he gave the order . Well , no , the truth is , we don 't actually know that shawn 's condition is the result of an attack . Nova 's not claiming credit , and shawn 's exactly the right age for onset of schizophrenia . So it 's possible that we 're looking for a crime , and the only thing we 'll find is a tragedy . Then there 's nothing we can do ... and I cannot accept that . Nova threatened shawn , shawn got sick . For right now , that 's all the cause and effect i need . You 're zachary ? Yeah , thanks for meeting me out here . It 's all right . Matthew said you had something you wanted to discuss ? About six weeks ago , a friend of mine from quarantine , she asked me to meet her for dinner . So I go , and ... and she 's asking me all sorts of questions . Now , she never came right out and said it , but I swear she was feeling me out to see if I would join the nova group . She was recruiting you ? I wouldn 't be surprised if she was a member . I mean , she used to bitch about the government all the time . I guess she just finally got fed up- - zachary ... if you got a name , give it to me . Jane nance . Thank you for coming forward . Hi . Todd ... ms . Mareva . What 's up ? Those things you said about me . They 're very private . How did you know ? Sometimes , when I 'm talking to somebody , if they feel something real strong , um , I feel it , too , and then I know why they feel that way . I see it . So , uh ... you saw what happened to my family ? Not the whole thing . I just get , like , fragments . Um , I saw the two cars hit . I saw this guy . There were empty beer bottles by his seat . He thought about getting out , calling the cops . I guess he changed his mind . The man who hit them ... you know who he is ? Yeah . I already wrote it down . I figured you 'd want it . Keane driscoll ... security told me you were up here . What are you doing ? I 'm packing shawn 's stuff . I 'm taking him out of that hospital . Isabelle , I have to caution you against overreaction . I know you 're worried about shawn , but all we have is a tip . We might know the name of one person in the nova group . What 's my dad going to do with that ? Let me guess , call ntac ? What 'll they do for shawn that I can 't ? They 're equipped to deal with 4400s . Not as well as I am . No . Matthew , get out of my way . What are you going to do ? We don 't even know if that tip is any good , and if this woman , jane nance , is in the nova group , there 's no guarantee that she 's the one that 's doing this to shawn . Well , if she 's not , she 'll get me closer to the person who is . She was recruited into nova , right ? So she 'll know at least one name . I 'll find that person . If they 're not the one , they 'll know a name , too , and eventually , I 'll find the person who 's hurting shawn , and I 'll make him stop . Wait . Hey , wait . Do you remember the first time i came to see you ? You were so sad . You didn 't know who you were , why you grew up so fast , why you were making your mother so sick , and I told you , you were one of the lucky ones . You have a purpose , a job to do . I even told you what it was . Do you remember ? Say it . I 'm supposed to eliminate the 4400 . That 's right . Not everyone from the future thinks they 're a good thing . Not everyone thinks they 're going to save the world . All this talk of a catastrophe the 4400 are supposed to prevent ? It 's lies . They are the catastrophe.All of them . Your father , shawn , and if he 's in trouble ... that 's good for us . So you keep telling me . Goodbye . No ! I can 't allow you to do this ! You 're not ready to be on your own.You need me . You need my guidance . I don 't think I do , matthew . Today 's graduation day . abendson psychiatric care facility shawn ? Isabelle . We have to go now , okay ? Isabelle ... isabelle ... my back teeth are melting , and ... They 're going to run down my throat . I can feel it . it 's okay . I 'm going to make you better . Just come with me , okay ? Okay ? Her name is jane nance , and she lives about 20 minutes away . We think the tip is good . If she really is a member of nova , you can bet she 'll be ready to defend herself , so let 's be careful . Here you go , triton . Here you go . Yeah , you 've been a very patient boy . Fidget ... what did I tell you about sitting on the tv ? Not yet , herkie . Who are you ? We all know what it 's like to hit bottom . We wouldn 't be here if we didn 'T . It comes in a different way for each of us , that ... that moment when we realize our drinking is out of control . I- - sorry to interrupt . It 's okay . It 's okay . Come on in . Grab a seat . I was just saying ... my name is keane , and I 'm an alcoholic . Hi , keane . Jane nance ! Oh , my god . What ? Get those animals away from her . What the hell happened here ? It 's like all these pets she keeps , they turned on her . Maybe someone ... turned them on her . He died very quickly . It could have been a massive stroke , maybe a coronary . I 'll call an ambulance , and the coroner . Mr. Tyler , those two ntac agents are here again . They say they need to see you . Look , mr . Tyler , isabelle broke shawn out of the hospital . We know that for a fact , and now we learn that matthew ross , a 36-year-old man , just happened to die of a stroke on the floor of shawn farrell 's living room . Within the hour , jane nance dies as well . I mean , are you telling us that you don 't see a connection ? I 'm telling you you 're talking about my daughter . She shouldn 't have taken shawn , I 'll admit that . She can be immature sometimes , yes , but she is not a killer . Any idea where isabelle may have taken shawn ? No , but if she calls , I 'll try to convince her to come in , and I 'll let you know . That 's the best I can do . Is there anything else ? See you . Thanks . it 's okay to be shy . I remember my first meeting . I didn 't say anything , either . I was ... at rock bottom . Embarrassed just to be breathing . How long ago was that ? About nine years . I , uh ... I was in a car accident . Truth is , I can barely even remember it . I came to ... and I knew ... I had to change my life . So I did . I 've been leading these meetings for five years now . How about you ? You have a moment like that ? Diana , we opened a trace on shawn 's cell phone . Richard tyler 's , too . If isabelle calls , we 'll be listening . Does this girl scare you as much as she scares me ? I mean , never mind what she did or didn 't do today . You just meet her ... I mean ... she looks like a normal kid . Attractive , maybe a bit naive , but when she says something ... you realize she 's looking at you like you 're an ant , and she 's just deciding whether or not she 's going to rip your legs off . Every other 4400 had a past before they were taken , a history . Not her . She just ... kind of sprouted . She 's not even a 4400 . She 's something else.A new category . We got a hit on the apb . Shawn 's car was spotted headed east on forbes avenue . That 's in everett.Let 's go . Uh , diana , I need to make a stop at home first . i 'm not taking those . I 'm not taking those . There 's radio antennas inside of there , and ... and ... that 's how they hear what I 'm thinking . I 'm not taking those . shawn , there are no radio antennas . They 're just pills.They make you feel better . The label says you 're supposed to take them every four hours . Shawn , stop that ! Wait a minute . There he is . It 's so late . You scared me . Sorry . Someone called in a tip on shawn 's car . It was abandoned , though . He 's still missing . everything okay ? Yeah . I don 't know . No . A boy at school , he has this gift . He sees things , things that already happened . He says he saw the ... accident that killed billy . Oh , my god . Baby ... why would he tell you that ? Because ... he also gave me the name of the man who did it . I went to see him , thomas . You did what ? He was leading an A.A. Meeting . He told me had a car accident while he was drunk nine years ago . Alana , sweetie , if this really is the guy , we 'll look into it . Based on what ? The visions of a 4400 who was a little kid when the accident happened ? Alana , please , don 't go see this guy again . It could be dangerous . You should pick up , thomas . Yeah , but ... are you sure you 're okay ? I 'm fine . Better than your nephew , anyway . Baldwin . The place is owned by a 4400 named jorge molina . The fire department found some burnt remains inside . They think it 's him . What started the fire ? They 're not sure . Apparently , molina had a habit of leaving oily rags laying around the garage . Someone in health and safety gave him a bunch of citations for it . Said it was a fire hazard . Guess they were right , huh ? Yeah , either that , or isabelle found the name of another member of the nova group . Hello ? This will all be over soon , daddy . Hello ? I found out who 's doing this to shawn . It 's daniel armand . Isabelle ? The last nova I talked to told me . Isabelle , w-where are you ? I 'm just waiting for him to come home , and then i 'm going to make him stop . Isabelle , if you know where armand is , we 'll tell ntac . They 'll take care of it . I 'm not stopping . Daddy ... when all this is done , can I come home ? Will they let me , or ... am I in too much trouble ? I don 't know . Maybe . If you stop now , maybe . Just tell me where you 're going so I can come meet you . Okay . Diana , we just intercepted a call to richard tyler 's phone . It was isabelle . Where is she ? She 's headed to an address in munhall . She says daniel armand is there . you 'd better not be hurting him . I 'm not . It 's almost done . Isabelle ... shawn ? Are you okay ? Yeah , I think so . What happened ? I don 't remember anything . What 's armand doing here ? He was hurting you . He broke your mind . That 's his ability.But I made him stop . He 's yours now . You can do what you want . Now she wants you to kill me . I 'm not killing anybody , isabelle . If you don 't , she will . Is that true ? I did what I had to do to make you better , and what does it matter anyway ? You 're not sick anymore . I know , I know . Thank you , but it 's over . It 's over . I 'm better.We have armand . Let 's just go.We can walk away . You don 't really know this girl at all , do you ? You think she 's one of us ? Don 't listen to him , isabelle . Stop talking . She 's not , shawn . She killed her way across town to find me , and there 's no way she 's walking away . I said , stop talking now . Don 't , isabelle . Don 't ! For the record , daniel , I didn 't kill your people , not exactly . All I did was turn their abilities against them . And what do you do again ? Oh , right . You make people crazy . No ... isabelle ... isabelle , stop it ! Stop it ! They want to take my organs out . All of them . They 're halfway done . why did you do that to him ? He was still a threat to you , shawn . If we just left , what 's to keep him from attacking you again ? Everything I did , I did to make you better . I don 't regret any of it . If I had to kill a hundred people , I would have . Who are you ? If anyone gets any resistance from the girl or daniel armand , xxx tom ? Anything to add ? No , let 's move . Stop ! Can 't do that , mr . Tyler , we need to end this . Look , if you go in there with your guns out , this can end badly for everybody . Let me talk to isabelle . See if I can get her to come out quietly . You guys got the place surrounded , right ? If I 'm gone more than five minutes , you can just come in anyway . Isabelle ? Shawn ? Richard . you 've got to talk to her . You 've got to talk to her . She wants to fight them . She 's going to get everyone killed . Daddy ! We can get past them . You can help me . We can get the guns out of their hands , right ? No , isabelle.We 're not here to fight the government . Not today . I don 't have a choice . Yes , you do . Walk out there with me . You 're going to get in trouble for breaking shawn out of the hospital . But we can deal with it . I don 't know what happened with matthew and the others , but we can deal with that , too , but if you go after those agents , that is it . You are an enemy of the government . They will catch you eventually . They will put you away forever . I don 't care how strong you are , and there won 't be anything i can do about it . All this ... I did it to save shawn , and he hates me now . Isabelle ... isabelle ... I don 't hate you . He 's just scared , that 's all.We all are . Let 's go . They 're coming out ! Shawn ! Are you all right ? Yeah , yeah . Daniel armand 's inside . He 's all yours . So this is what feels like to watch someone get away with murder . If there 's no evidence of foul play . How can there be a murder ? As for the deaths , shawn doesn 't remember anything . There 's no witnesses , so officially , we don 't have a case . Yeah , but ... she did it , and I can 't help but think when all this is over she 's going to do a lot more . Their names were billy and paul . Paul was my husband . Billy was our son . They were killed in a hit-and-run accident in 1997 . The same year you hit bottom . Everything . You killed them . Look , I told you before . Nine years ago ... I was a different man . Something happened . Something ... terrible ... and I had a choice . I could end my life , or I could try to live it better , and I decided to live , and I did do better . I dedicated myself to it . I mean , look around ! I help people . You do , and you probably feel like that 's enough . I bet you you go days , whole weeks , even , without ever thinking about that other man and what he did . I think about it every day . It never goes away for me ... and I 'm going to make sure it never goes away for you , either . I won 't let you forget them . I 'm fine , daddy . They treated me fine . I just need ... a little time alone , okay ? Isabelle ... you know , sometime very soon , we 're going to have to talk about matthew , about all this . How did you get in here ? shut the door . We need to talk . About what ? Some people want me to kill you . I was hoping you could tell me why . Who gave you that ? Long story . Let 's just say the woman who left it for me , she called you evil . Said if humanity was going to survive , you had to die . What , you think that 's funny ? No . It 's just , it seems like a lot of people have opinions about me . Either I 'M ... the savior , or I 'm the end of the world . It 's nice to have options , I guess . That man , matthew ? The one who had a stroke ? He came to me right after I grew up . He said I was supposed to do all kinds of things . Destroy the 4400 . Kill them all . He told me it was the only way to save the world . I told him no . I might have been concei in the future , but I 'm not their puppet . He didn 't like that . He 's not around anymore . Neither are those members of the nova group . Those people wterrorists . They were murderers ! They were hurting shawn ! Look ... whoever told you that I 'm bad , that I 'm some sort of walking armageddon , is wrong . I turned my back on all that . I 'm not a murderer , and you know what ? I don 't care how much I scare you , I don 't think you are , either . You don 't know me . No ? Let 's find out . Here I am . The angel of death , the end of the human race , or whatever the hell it is they call me . I won 't move . I promise . No . Not yet . Not until I 'm sure . And you 're not a murderer . It 's okay . You should take that with you in case you change your mind . You better hope I don 'T . local man in critical condition after one-car accident I made that happen , didn 't I ? No , todd . I did . I didn 't mean to . I didn 't want to ... but I did . Welcome to haspel corp.How may i help you ? Hi . I have an appointment with dennis ryland . My name 's isabelle tyler . Miss tyler . Mr. Ryland 's expecting you . Go on up to 24.He 's waiting . The 4400 Season 3 Episode 6 ( 2006 ) - Graduation Day -

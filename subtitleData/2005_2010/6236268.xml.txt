 All right , get out of the way . Get out of the way ! Come here ! Come here ! Move , move ! Come on , come on , come on , come on ! This is Scott . Slow down the evac ! We are coming in too hot ! Colonel , come in ! MAN 1 : Move it back ! MAN 2 : Oh , my God , where are we ? WOMAN 1 : What is this place ? SCOTT : Move away from the gate ! - Where are we ? - MAN 3 : Where is this ? Why didn 't we come through to Earth ? There 's no time to explain . Off to the side ! WOMAN 2 : What 's going on ? SCOTT : All right . Come on , come on , come on . This is Scott . Come in ! Colonel , come in ! - I need a medic ! - Over here ! JOHANSEN : Can you move your fingers ? VOLKER : No . I think my arm 's broken . Okay , just hold your arm there and we 'll put it in a sling , okay ? Keep calm . Keep coming . Clear this area . There could still be more incoming . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . We 've got to move . Move ! Where the hell are we ? - Greer ? Where 's Colonel Young ? - He was right behind me . - Move . Move . Move . - SCOTT : Quiet ! - GREER : Stay calm ! - Move . Excuse me . GREER : Keep it down ! Move . Move . Move . Move . Move . Colonel ? Colonel ? Don 't move . Where are ... Where are we ? I don 't know , sir . Are you ... You 're in charge , okay ? You 're ... Sir ? - T.J. ! - JOHANSEN : I 'm coming ! GREER : Move back , people ! Coming through ! JOHANSEN : Let 's go ! Move , move , move ! GREER : Get back , people . - Is he okay ? - I don 't know . WRAY : Get back ! Wallace ! What is this place ? - Look , I just did what Rush told me ... - Where is he ? I don 't know . He went through ahead of me . Rush ! Rush ! Eli , help me find him . What , I ... MAN 5 : What 's that ? What in the hell was that ? I don 't know . Look , Sergeant , I need you to get these people settled . And you find out who and what we 've got . Nobody leaves this room . Yes , sir . Eli ! Now ! ELI : The core of the planet is the power source . You have to channel it into the weapon to destroy the enemy ship . - MAN : Can 't do it , dude . - Uh , doing it . It 's one of those programmer 's jokes , a problem that can 't be solved . - Already solved it . - No , you didn 't . Just shut up ! Watch this . - What the hell ! - What happened ? Nothing happened . I 'm back at the beginning of the level . - You 're so full of yourself . - No . No , no , no . It worked . - The firing code locked in . - Whatever . That was extremely unsatisfying . Eli Wallace ? Actually , Eli 's not here right now . Okay , okay . Whatever you guys think that I did , I swear you got the wrong guy . Do I look like someone who 'd be standing here if I didn 't already know everything there is to know about you ? - Yeah , not really . - Right . ELI : Who are you ? Dr. Nicholas Rush . May we come in ? Why ? You just spent a great deal of time recently playing an online fantasy game called Prometheus . Big Brother 's got nothing better to do ? Last night you solved the Dakara weapons puzzle . Yeah , a month of my life went into that . You know what happens when you solve that thing ? Nothing . We 're here . That happened . To complete that particular puzzle , you had to solve a millennia-old mathematical proof , written in another language . For that , you 've won something of a prize . Well , whatever it is , I 'll take the cash equivalent . There isn 't one . It 's a non-disclosure agreement . Non-disclosure ? So , you guys really embedded a top-secret problem into a game , hoping someone like me would solve it ? Yup . So , what do you need me for now ? I assure you , it 'll be worth your while to sign it . And if I don 't ? We 'll beam you up to our spaceship . Right . I think I want my lawyer to look it over first . And by " lawyer , " I assume you mean " mother . " So , we 'll just agree then that I will call you . What the ... Welcome aboard the Hammond , Eli . Yes , that is planet Earth , and yes , you are on a spaceship . We need your help , Eli . To be honest , I don 't know how long it 's going to take . I should call my mom to tell her where I am . That 's probably not going to work up here . Right . You can speak to her on the way . There 's a cover story you 'll have to follow . I 'm sorry . On the way to ? To another planet , 21 light years from here . I can 't go . I have things that ... We know about your mother 's condition . You just know everything , don 't you ? We also know that you are currently unemployed , and that your mother 's medical coverage is an ongoing issue . We 'll see she gets the best available care while you 're gone . And if I don 't sign , what ? You going to erase my memory ? Something like that . Can I get some pants ? Hello , I 'm Dr. Daniel Jackson , and behind me is a stargate . It was originally built millennia ago by an alien race who we call the Ancients . Over the next few hours , we 'll be touching on some of the things ... There are 39 symbols representing star constellations as seen from Earth ... When a connection is made between two stargates , an unstable energy vortex emerges from the gate ... Whoa ! And settles into the event horizon , or " puddle , " as we like to call it . Later , it was discovered that using an eighth symbol would actually dial another galaxy in hundreds of thousands of light years via an interstellar wormhole . It is believed an unprecedented amount of power is required to reach the near-mythical ninth chevron . The first six symbols ... Icarus Base was established on a planet discovered two years ago to have a uniquely powerful core . The entire purpose of the project is to hopefully one day dial the nine chevron address found in the Ancient database . Hi ! I 'm Dr. Daniel Jackson . Now , you 've heard the term " hyperspace " for years ... - Where are you ? - ELI : It 's top secret . - Eli ! - I 'm serious , Ma . I can 't say anything more than that . But I don 't understand . Why could you not at least tell me you were leaving ? I 'm sorry , but did you get the letter from ... Yeah , the Air Force . I got it . Are you in a plane now ? You sound like you 're in an airplane . Uh , no . It 's nothing like that . I want you to know that they 're going to look after you . Well , you didn 't have to do this . This is good . Really . It 's the kind of thing I always dreamed of . - Hi . - You mind ? - No , go ahead . - Thank you . First time on a spaceship , too ? Me ? I 've been on lots of various ... - Eli Wallace . - I know . - You 've heard of me ? - I have . Wow , that almost never happens . And you are ? Chloe . I work for Alan Armstrong . Senator of California ? Oh , yeah , yeah . I have heard of California . My last job was in the burger and fries field . How 'd you line that up ? I was a political science major at Harvard , so ... Mmm . I hear it 's a good school . For a while there I was at ... MIT . I know . Really ? What else have they told you about me ? - What ? - I 've seen this writing before . - In the game ? - Yeah . Sheesh . We 're on a ship ? RUSH : The design is clearly Ancient , in the truest sense of the word . Launched hundreds of thousands of years ago . Dr. Rush ? Faster than light , yet not through hyperspace . - What are you doing ? - Who knows how far it 's traveled . Dr. Rush , I 've got a lot of wounded . We need to get home . JOHANSEN ON RADIO : Lieutenant Scott , come in . Go ahead . We 've got a problem . One of the air vents just shut down in here . Copy that . Yeah , the air 's getting pretty thin in here , too . - What does that mean ? - That the life support system is failing . And we should probably do something about that . EMILY : Well , it 's always just one more year . It 's a command . - Where ? - It 's a lot safer than other places I 've been . - You 've put your time in , Everett . - When this tour is over , I promise ... You know what ? Never mind . Don 't bother . You always end up choosing somewhere other than here . I am not choosing my job over you . How you can even say ... How you can even say that to me ? I love you , but I can 't wait anymore . I can 't wait anymore . Everett ? Are you okay ? Sweetheart , baby , look at me . Colonel ? Colonel ? Oh , my God . Can 't you do something ? He 's having a seizure . There 's nothing I can do . ON RADIO : Scott , this is Colonel Young . Come in , please . Our guests have arrived a few minutes early , Lieutenant . What 's your position ? Come on . Not yet . Not yet . Lieutenant , drop whatever you 're doing and get your ass up here . I 'm on my way , sir . Bye . Holy ... Senator , it is my honor to welcome you to Icarus Base . Colonel . This is my executive assistant , Chloe . - It 's a pleasure to meet you , sir . - The pleasure 's mine . She 's also my daughter . - You must be the ... - Contest winner , yeah . That is a big gun . Rail gun . 500 rounds per minute . This is Lieutenant Scott . He 's been assigned to you , Mr. Wallace . Shall we go inside ? ELI : Unbelievable . SCOTT : Yeah , it is . It 's weird how fast you can start to take something like this for granted . So , if a stargate can instantly transport you to another planet , why did we fly here on a spaceship ? Something to do with how this one 's tied into the planet for power . Apparently , it 's been modified to only dial out because incoming wormholes are too dangerous . You 're the genius . You can probably tell me better . All I did was solve a puzzle in a video game . Hey , you figured out something Dr. Rush has been trying to figure out for months , which , by the way , a lot of people were glad to see . RUSH : And , of course , you know Colonel Telford . - Ready for this , Colonel ? - You just give the word , sir . Oh , I gave it quite a while ago , Colonel . I 'm just here to see how my $ 1.6 billion is being spent . Very good . Thank you , everyone . Dismissed . As you know , up until now , we have been unable to channel the precise amount of power necessary to unlock the stargate 's ninth and final chevron . However , thanks to some ingenuity from young Mr. Wallace here , that problem has finally been solved . YOUNG : We 've heard that before . This time we 're sure . That 's what I figured out ? I embedded the mathematical problem we had to solve into the game . I then engineered your solution into a practical , workable application . - What say we get on with it ? - Absolutely . Sergeant Riley . - RILEY : Chevron one encoded . - Sir . We 're dialing now ? - A test , to see if we can make a connection . - RILEY : Chevron one locked . If we do , we will send an automated reconnaissance drone through . We 'll see what 's on the other side . RILEY : Chevron two locked . And then they 'll go ? No , first , we close down again , assess the data we receive , - and then perhaps send the away team . - If it works . RILEY : Chevron four locked . Until then , they 're just interested observers , like us . RILEY : Chevron five locked . Chevron six encoded . Chevron six locked . Chevron seven encoded . Chevron seven locked . Chevron eight encoded . Chevron eight locked . Chevron nine encoded . - Whoa , what 's going on ? - I don 't know . We never got this far before . Chevron nine ... Chevron nine will not lock . We matched the power requirements down to the EMU . It must work . Power levels in the gate capacitors are going into the red . - Shut it down . - No , wait , wait , wait . RILEY : We 're reading fluctuations in the output from the core ... Shut it down now . - It should have worked . - Well , it didn 't . And drawing power from the planet 's core ... Dangerous ? Yes . We 're all aware of that ... Regardless of what 's been spent or what 's at stake , my first priority is to ensure the safety of the people on this base . Of course . Of course . Eli , we 'd best run through your equations again . If you 'll excuse me . You are not seriously putting this on me ! Not my fault . SCOTT : People , you have to calm down . Seriously , you have to calm down . MAN : We got power ! WOMAN : Thank God ! Everybody 's attention , please . All right , please listen . Hey , listen up ! What is going on ? We are on an Ancient spaceship . - MAN : What ? - That 's all I 've got . Now , what that means is that ... That means you need to use the stargate to get us all back home . That is definitely on the list of things to do , sir , - but I think right now ... - You can consider that an order . We are working on it , sir . Now , I need to speak to the person responsible for this . Where is Dr. Rush ? - Just shut up for a second , will you ! - How dare you talk to ... - Dad ? Dad , please . - WOMAN : Medic ! - Water ? Water ? Quickly . Over here . - Get ... CHLOE : Sit down . ARMSTRONG : The pills . Look , I 'm sorry . I 'm just trying to explain the situation . We are on a ship , but we have no idea where we are in relation to Earth . Now , with respect , sir , the reason you might be having a hard time breathing right now is because the ship 's life-support system is not functioning properly . Dr. Rush is working on that right now . Brody and Park ? - Here ! - Here . Okay , good , you two are with me . - But these consoles just came on . - No , nobody touch anything yet ! Dr. Rush needs your help . Everybody else , just stay calm , stay put . Please . MAN : " Stay put " ? Wait , what do you mean ? You 're just going like that ? There has to be a mistake in here somewhere . Seriously , who uses a whiteboard anymore ? You have computers , like , everywhere around here . The power flow was in the target range . Why wouldn 't the address connect ? Wrong address ? There is only one found in the Ancient database in Atlantis . With no other instructions ? No , but that 's not the issue . It has to be your proof . My proof works . You know how I know that it does ? Because you said so . Gentlemen . How 's it coming ? - Whoa , whoa ! What are you doing ? - Starting from the beginning . Wait . Save ! Save ! Save ! I can 't ... Mr. Wallace , I would like you to join me for dinner in the officers ' mess . - Thank you , I 'm starving . - We 're quite close to a breakthrough , actually . I 'd like Eli to keep working . Well , we 've been here for six months . It can wait a few more hours . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . So , Colonel , you really have no idea where this ninth chevron stargate address is gonna send you ? No idea at all . Hmm . But the Ancients built the stargate with nine chevrons . It 's got to go somewhere . YOUNG : We 've also known for some time that the only way to unlock the ninth chevron was to solve the power issues . Well , if anyone 's going to solve it , I think Eli will . Yes , that 's right . It 's true . I am Math Boy . Dr. Rush . Dr. Rush ! ARMSTRONG : I would like to propose a toast . Oh , no , that 's really not necessary . - Not to you . - Oh . When the proposal for this project first crossed my desk , I did not want to approve it . - Oh , my God . - It seemed clear to me at the time that there were enough terrestrial matters of importance that needed that kind of money . Now , being a proud father of a beautiful young woman is one thing . Having that young woman exceed every possible expectation is quite another . It was my daughter , Chloe , who reminded me that there is no greater endeavor than seeking an understanding of who we are , and the mysteries of the universe in which we all exist . - Not in those exact words . - It was also her idea to embed the Ancient proof in a medium that would give us access to brilliant young minds that we would have otherwise overlooked . And so to all the brave men and women who have volunteered ... Okay , what was that ? This is Young . YOUNG : The base is under attack . All non-combatant personnel report to your designated areas . Everyone else to your battle stations . This is not a drill . Senator , I need you and your daughter to go with Lieutenant Scott . - Eli ! You as well . - Oh , yeah . WOMAN : Hurry . SCOTT : Yeah , we 're on our way . GREER : What 's going on in here ? The life-support system is on , but for some reason , it 's not working properly . I 'm attempting to reset it . He has no idea what he 's doing . - Step away from that thing . - ELI : That screen says that what you 're doing is gonna overload it ... - Eli , please ! - Is that what it says or not ? You only think you know what it says in this screen because I embedded a rudimentary version of the Ancient language into the game . - This is not a game . - Don 't touch it , Rush . When the oxygen aboard this ship falls below critical level , it will become increasingly difficult to concentrate . And what you 're doing could blow up the whole ship . - Are you sure , Eli ? - Back off now or I will shoot ! Lower your weapon , Sergeant ! He already screwed us once . I 'm not going to let him do it again ! I need to get through , people . Stand aside . Sergeant , we 're under attack . Don 't know who , don 't know why . Consider the charges dropped . Go take your anger out on them . Yes , sir . YOUNG ON RADIO : What do we got , Colonel , Lucian Alliance ? That would be my guess . They haven 't introduced themselves . They started shooting the minute they came out of hyperspace . Our shields are holding , but we 're not the target . What 's heading our way ? A full squadron of gliders and a troop transport . We cut them down some , but the rest will be on your doorstep in less than three minutes . - Telford , did you copy ? - Roger that . If we can get to the transport before they land their troops , we stand a chance . RUSH : I am going to press that button . It 's going to fix the life support , and then you and I , and everyone else , will be able to breathe and think much better . Don 't do it . Okay , look . Sergeant , I know we are in a tough situation here , but I am giving you an order . Lower your weapon . So ? Well , I suppose that would have been too simple . Apparently , that did nothing . This may take a little more time , T.J. Hang in there . Copy . Does Colonel Young know about this ? He knows . Two weeks ago you told me that this was the best experience of your life . - Something must have happened . - The scholarship came in . I guess I 've just been too afraid to admit what I really want . Wow , you didn 't tell me you had even applied . There 's nothing else going on . You know I 'd tell you . - Unless you were protecting someone else . - I 'm not . Like I said , I just hadn 't made up my mind . RILEY : Dr. Rush ? I 'm reading a dangerous energy spike in the core . Eli ! Eli ! I need your help . - With what ? - The ninth chevron . What ? We need to get the hell out of here . Look , it took us two years to find this site . The properties are unique . This may be our last chance . If this bombardment continues , the radioactive core is going to go critical . You mean the planet ... It 's going to explode ? - Yes . - Ah ! Okay , okay , okay , okay . - If my math works ... - We can 't assume that ... I said " if " ! Then if it works , then it 's not a power supply issue , it 's the gate address . We 've known the first eight symbols for years , the ninth has to be the point of origin . So , what if we 're not on the planet you 're supposed to be dialing from ? This is where we are . Okay , what if we are not supposed to be here ? Icarus Base , Telford . We can 't hold them back . Let 's go ! Go ! Sergeant Riley , dial the stargate to Earth ! - SOLDIER : Incoming ! - Come on , come on . RILEY : Chevron one locked . ELI : Okay , follow me . The symbols on the stargate are constellations as seen from Earth . - That 's what you said ... - Yes , yes . Okay , so what if Earth is supposed to be the point of origin ? - RILEY : Chevron two locked . - The only viable power source was here , - light years away . - What if that doesn 't matter ? What if it 's the only combination that will work , like a code ? - RILEY : Chevron three locked . - A code ? - Yeah . - RILEY : Chevron four encoded . - Stop the dialing sequence . - RILEY : I have my orders . Get out of my way . Get out of the way ! We can 't risk dialing Earth . ARMSTRONG : Come on , let 's go . SCOTT : Go , go , keep moving . - Dad ? Dad ? Dad ! - SCOTT : Chloe ! My father ! There could still be people trapped on the other side . All right , let 's go , people . You need to move it to the Gate Room ! This is Scott . I got about a dozen or so people cut off from the Gate Room , southeast corridor . - Oh , God ! Okay . Damn it ! - YOUNG : Oh , my God ! - Is that Dr. Simms ? - Stay with me , okay ? He was helping pull people back from the surface . - Simms , can you hear me ? - T.J. - T.J. - No ! Hey , Tamara . Hey , Tamara . Come on , we got to go . That is impressive . The power 's fluctuating at critical levels . Colonel , I 'm detecting a massive buildup of energy from the planet . Recall our fighters . Radio Colonel Telford . He 's got two minutes to get his people aboard before we jump to hyperspace . What 's everybody doing ? I ordered an evacuation . He , uh ... He didn 't dial Earth . It 's the ninth chevron address . What ? The attack started a chain reaction in the planet 's core . There 's no way of stopping that . And any blast could easily translate through an open wormhole . It 's too dangerous to dial Earth . You could have dialed somewhere else . Anywhere else . - RUSH : This could be our only chance . - Shut it down . - You can 't , it 's too late . - Riley ! - System 's not responding , sir . - I need to get these people out of here . - We have a way out . - We don 't know what 's on the other side ! - Damn it , Rush ! - Can 't be worse than here , can it ? Nobody move . Await further instructions . What 's that ? Well , it doesn 't look like life support . RUSH : Yes , I realize that . Whoa ! - What are we looking at ? - It 's a star map . PARK : That 's the Milky Way . RUSH : I believe it 's a visual log of the ship 's journey . So , this is where we are now ? No . That 's where the ship originally embarked from . ELI : Earth . - It 's leaving the galaxy . - RUSH : It did . Long ago . That was Pegasus . So , those points are more stars ? No , they 're galaxies . Rush , where the hell are we ? Several billion light years from home . - Please . - YOUNG : Scott . Stand clear . You could take down the rest of the roof with that . Look , we don 't have time to argue . I need you to lead the evacuees through the gate . You need to go with him . No ! I 'm staying here until I know my father 's okay . Make sure everyone carries as much of the expedition supplies as they can . - Why ? - ' Cause you 're not going to Earth . Rush dialed the ninth chevron . Go . Go ! Once I 'm through , follow one at a time on a three-count . SOLDIER : Okay , people . Make way . Come on , let 's go . Keep it going . You good ? Okay , let 's go . If you can hear me , stand back ! Okay , get down . Fire in the hole ! Dad ? Dad ? GREER : Put your weight on me . - Put your weight on me . - YOUNG : Stay calm , everybody . - I got you . - CHLOE : Please . Okay , everybody stay calm ! Don 't push . Dad ! Careful , careful . - YOUNG : You 're okay , sir . - Are you okay ? I 'm the last one . I 'm all right . Greer , go . I 'm right behind you . Hammond , this is Young , come in . Hammond , this is Young . Come in . GREER : Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go , come on , people . Let 's do it . Let 's do it . SOLDIER : Hurry up ! - Sir ! - Go ! Sir . We 've got Colonel Carter . On screen . General , we barely got away . The planet was destroyed . We managed to beam most of our people off the surface before jumping to hyperspace . We also believe that the enemy forces were destroyed . Any word on how they gained intel on our base ? No . What about casualties ? Twelve . Eighty-plus MIA . The bunker-shielding technology prevented us from beaming out anyone inside . How many people made it through the gate to Earth ? None . None ? Our sensors indicated that the stargate was active for a full six minutes before the core went critical . Well , they didn 't come through here . Then where 'd they go ?

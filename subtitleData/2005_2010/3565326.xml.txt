 Previously on warehouse 13 ... claudia donovan , warehouse 13 : Next generation . Don 't you want to be with people your own age ? Artie , I 'm at my own age . This place is my home . Macpherson 's headed east on st.Catherine ! I want what you risked your lives to get . I can get macpherson again . I don 't doubt it . You came after family . Arthur started it . What is that supposed to mean ? Ask him . 15 YEARS AGO Don 't quote warehouse dogma to me , arthur ! A woman 's life is at stake . Many people 's lives are at stake ! - And you made an oath . - I love her . I will save her . You love her . I know that you love her too . Then you know how agonizing this is for me . You can save her life ! What about the consequences ? She lives , other people die ! You want that on your head ? You can 't play god ! Well , neither can you . Neither you nor physics nor the regents . They sit in there , arthur , and they hoard the things that can save the world . We help them . Well , not anymore . I 'm finished with it . Now , give me that ! No . No ! I can 'T . Arthur ... arthur . Five firemen died that night . Only the woman survived . Who was she ? Carol augustine . She lives in D.C. Now , alone , as far as we know . And she was macpherson 's wife ? Yes . Did they ever nail the murdering son of a - macpherson was given five consecutive life sentences and banished from the warehouse . So obviously macpherson escaped . After serving two years in confinement , there was an unexplained explosion in the prison . Dozens were killed . We were told that macpherson was among them . We were misinformed . Then he shows up at the japanese embassy in D.C. We 've had carol under surveillance ever since . I 've been monitoring the D.C.Operation , and he hasn 't made any contact . No , he went after my family instead . I can understand why artie 's obsessed with him . Well , this guy has no trouble killing anybody , does he ? As you go after him , you 'd do well to remember that . Come on So how do you banish somebody from the warehouse anyway ? It 's sounds very romeo juliet . No , no , no , there 's nothing romantic about it . The walls of this warehouse are infused with this very rare mineral called painite . And before macpherson was incarcerated , he was permanently injected with a substance that reacts violently when in proximity of this painite . Violently ? Could you be a tad more specific with your modifiers ? I could . If macpherson ran through this warehouse , then his blood would turn acidic and immediately eat through his own veins . Dude ... indeed . Where are you , by the way ? Already through the middle east , heading into north africa-I 'll find him . - Yeah ? - It 's what I does . Well , you may have met your match when it comes to hacking through what macpherson - oh , yes.Who da best ? You got a nibble ? - A chomp . - What ? Edgar allen poe 's pen . For sale . No.Let me see.Excuse me . " To view the rest of this elite collection ... " collection ? Why would he be selling artifacts if-don 't don 't click that ! Um , I always run a virus scan before I enter an unknown site . - That 's a good idea . - So yeah ... oh , no.No , no , no , no , no . You do not shut down the claudiometer . I 'm terribly , terribly sorry . Life in the cyberworld , bro . Gonna need a sec . - You know , you could try - touch it and die . WASHINGTON , DC Thank you for waiting , sir . Mr.Freitag , I feel that this may be of particular interest to you . What , exactly , does this do , mr.Macpherson ? Run your fingers along the rim . Oh , god ! Consider it a gift . A taste of things to come . Mr.Macpherson , what other artifacts will be for sale ? Mr.Pak , already greedy for more I see . Well , I am in the process of collecting others as we speak . But in the meantime , behold the phoenix . This is the reason why we are here in my factory-this demonstration ? Very perceptive , mr.Freitag. Yes , I didn 't think that cautious gentlemen , such as yourselves , would want to spend this kind of money on hearsay or legend . You would be correct . Carson , would you just hold this for a moment ? Thank you . What are you doing , man ? Wait ! Stop ! He 'll die in there . Patient ! Patience . Patience . Yes.There. As you see , in the right hands , this can be uniquely useful . What is it ? What 's wrong with them ? - Cause and effect , gentlemen . - Cause and effect . Even anomalies are bound by their own laws of nature . Insignificant collateral damage . But appropriate for a demonstration . Mr.Macpherson , make it stop . It cannot be stopped . For every life the phoenix saves , others will be lost . Those who touch the phoenix , they will be spared . But others are less fortunate . You dare to do this in my factory ? A demonstration , mr.Freitag. If you haven 't the stomach for it , perhaps the phoenix is not for you . Gentlemen ... can you imagine this tool in the hands of one of your patriots ? The commitment of a suicide bomber who never , ever dies . Warehouse13 Season1 Episode13 I managed to crashthe computer system , so I 'm sorry , till we 're up and running , deaf , dumb , and blind . Don 't worry , I 'll get us back online . A girl loves a challenge . Oh , that 's just great . The fate of the warehousein the hands of a 16-year-old kid . - Perfect . - Okay , 19.19 And the same kid who found you and hacked into supersecretville once already.Okay ? A little faith , please . Why is he selling the pen ? I mean , god knowswhat else he 's got . What is he up to ? Okay , let 's go overwhat we don 't know . That could take weeks . - Months . - Years . Look , artie , you must haveforgotten something . You know macpherson betterthan anybody . There must be some small detailthat you 've overlooked . Yeah , somethinginsignificant . A contacthe might have used . A favorite place . A relative . Just ... you two are what , interrogating me ? They 're investigating . That 's why we hired them.Is it not ? Um , so about carol . How do you knowabout carol ? What did--what--you told them ? Everything ? No , of course you did . Of course you did . No wonder I 'm gettingthe third degree . You think you might haveasked me before you justblurt it out ? Agent nielsen ! You 're forgettingyourself . Arthur , no one knowswhat he 's capable of better than you . Except , possibly , me . Bering and agent lattimerwill need to know everything if they 're to survive this . Everything . Yeah.Sorry.You 're right . It 's just that I nevershould have gone to see carolin the first place . When macpherson went to D.C ... and the years have justtwisted his thinking . I just didn 't know if I wasputting her life in danger . The three of you needto speak to her . No.No , no , no . I 've already put enoughof a spotlight on that woman . You 've got no choice , arthur . She 's our only lead . Dude Don 't sweat it . I 'll cover it from here . After being magnetizedto the ceiling and nearly ground upin the gooery , I think I 'm prepped.What ? Why are you shakingyour jowls at me ? You should all get going . I 'll stay with claudia , and she will brief meon those two events . No matter what he said , you 're not safe . I haven 't seen james macphersonin 15 years . I never even visited himin prison . Well , that 's hard to believesince he saved your life . Others died that nightin my place . I wouldn 't have madethat choice . And I have never forgiven jamesfor making it for me . Artie knows that . You like fresh-cut flowers . - I beg your pardon . - They 're all aroundthe apartment . Well , as you said , I like them . There 's a jewelry box in the trash with some wrapping paper . - I had a birthday . - Your birthday 'sin four months . We 're very good at the google . There 's two umbrellasbehind me . One 's pink , one 's black . - Was it raining three days ago ? - I think it was . He 's not the manyou think he is . - he 's changed . - Carol ... carol ... Listen to me . I would like to protect you from whatever the hell it ishe 's planning to do . God , you know , you come barging in here disrupting my life . He 's only been herea few times . When was the last ? Three days ago . Oh , well , it 's easy to understand how you would haveforgotten that . What 's this ? - I have no idea . - Let me see that . This is an egyptian symbol . It 's a was scepter . It represents power . The deities used tocarry this around as a sign of their controlover the forces of chaos . It 's funny ... it 's the same as the pendant you 're wearingaround your neck . Oh , let me see that . That 's very nice . - It 's from james ? - Yes . You know I haveto ask you for it , carol . Amazing . You think working insome magical storage unit gives you the rightto do as you please ? Stop protecting him . I never could decide , does mrs.Frederic hirearrogant people , or do you just get arrogantby working there ? - What is it ? - I got a really bad feeling . About what ? Well , I think it 's about ... artie . I think--I think he 's gonna - never mind.It 's gone now . 6166 broadview . Ironically , the warehouse district . We are up and running . Taking her to warp speed , captain . Okay , do you think you canhack into macpherson 's site ? Well , yeah , duh.But major fire-wallage . I mean , you get past one , and there 's another one set up right at - claudia.Claudia , what 's wrong ? Who 's that ? That 's him . That-that 's james macpherson ? Claudia ... leena ... I know him . How ? He was joshua 'sphysics professor . I mean , I was just a kid , but I remember that face . He was the one who gave joshuarheticus 's compass . He contacted me . What ? When ? Eight months ago . I was tracking artie , trying to find this place , and I hit a snag . And out of the blue I hear fromprofessor reynolds , right . He " friends " me.We email back and forth . " How 's joshua ? " Blah blah blah . I fill him in , tell him about my project , and he suggests a few waysaround the firewall . The warehouse firewall ? Leena , I thinkjames macpherson helped me hack into the warehouse . Tool and die factory ? Why tool and die . What is he doing ? I don 't know , maybehe 's got a new career . He doesn 't exactly strike meas the blue-collar type . All right , this is-this is a german machine , I think . I think they all are . - Why would he go to the trouble - can I help you ? We 're not opento the public . We 're looking forjames macpherson . There 's no one hereby that name . Do you know him ? Who are you ? Secret service . We 're gonna need to look around . Yes , well , by all meansmake yourself at home . What are you doing ? Close your eyes . Okay . All right . Just close your eyes . There.You can hear me ? - Oh ! Yeah . - Yes ? All right . - Okay ? - Okay . Artie , what was that ? That was the gobletof severan . A goblet of severanbecause , obviously , the goblet 's in the warehouse , so there must have beenanother one that survived . Well , I bet I can guesswhat it does . Pete , put this glassing your pocket . This--this-this was designedby a roman glass blower in 221 for the emperor elagabalus , who was a ridiculouslyincompetent young man . The only way he couldget a room quiet was by using this thing . It emitteda high-pitched sound and brought everyoneto their knees . I could 've used one of thosein high school . Indeed . All right , so just , um-artie , this has thategyptian symbol on it . - The was scepter . - Yes . Maybe carol 'S ... like ... this . And now it ... opens . Always interesting . Hold this . - The phoenix . - What ? - It 's the phoenix . - Wait , wait . Let me see , let me see . I look great in glasses . Oh , my--that is amazing ! What ? What is that ? " Starting bid $ 20 million " ? - It says that ? - Yeah , it 's like a catalog . But the phoenix isin the warehouse . He 's selling it ? 20 million , and that 's just the starter . No , he can 't have it.It 's in the warehouse . That doesn 't make any sense . Why would he sell it ? I mean , he 's not doing thisfor the money . Yeah , what kind of a villainwould he be ? Listen to me . The phoenix is in the warehouse . He doesn 't have it . Well--but even if he didhave it , right , he 's not doing thisfor the money . No , he 's not doing itfor the money . He 's doing itfor another reason.I just don 't know what . Here , check it . This is too easy . He wants us to findthese things . Exactly , which is what 'smaking me very , very nervous about following this lead . And making me very nervous ... about dragging the two of youwith me . - Don 't even worry about that . - No , no , no . All right , fine . Yes , obviously it 's a trapof some sort . But he would knowthat I know it 's a trap . So what is he planning , knowing that I know he knows ? Guys , this-this has the date , time , and address of the auction , and ... it 's today . The auction is today . Is she certain ? She claims that macphersonwas posing as joshua 's professor . That 's how he madehis initial contact . She 's very upset . Where is she now ? At the b 'n'B . Your bodyguard 's keepingan eye on her . What is it ? I 've just always felt thatshe was out of tune . Something hovering . I just could nevertell what , exactly . This is troubling . Do you think that he couldstill be using her somehow ? Yes . Macpherson claimsto have the phoenix . The phoenix isin the warehouse . I know . I 'll get back to you . Now I 'm getting angry . When I told himthe phoenix was gone , he was genuinely surprisedand distraught . Then he told me aboutthe goblet of severan . Well , here it is . Safe and sound . Open it , please . Okay . That 's not possible . - He can 't possibly have accessto warehouse things unless - yes . These new video displaysrecord access , do they not ? Hang on . There 's my access , which was a few moments ago . Let me just toggle backto see the last person ... macpherson certainly knowshow to pick his spots . - This is frederic . - Go ahead , I 'll catch up . I feel like custer walkinginto little big horn . If he wanted us dead , he 's had several opportunities . This--this is aboutsomething else . All right , well , what ? This is the place . This is the time . There 's nothing here . Hey , guys , the phoenixand the goblet of severan ... mrs.Frederic says it 's beentaken from the warehouse . And she seemed shaken . - Mrs.Frederic ? - Yeah . - Seemed shaken ? - Yeah . That is so not comforting . Oh , great , great . So what do we do now ? Just wait for macphersonto drop a net on us ? If he 's ahead of usand we can 't see him , then we 're gonna have tofollow the trail he leaves until we can see him . And we watcheach other 's backs . What ? - Good afternoon . - Nothing.Nothing. Do you see that ? Did--did the boycause this ? Artie , artie , you still got those glasses ? Good idea . You know ... oh , I thought I knewwhat these were--this is-but they 're notthe originals . He replicated timothy leary 'sreading glasses , but why ? Check these out . The guy who gave us lsd ? Dr.Leary experimentedwith a lot of different ways to see beyond what our brainsare capable of seeing . Okay , can I see those , please ? You know , the originals , when you put them on , you never want totake ' em off . Tell me about it . - Artie ? - Yeah . Um , that wooden box.Can I see that ? Thank you . Fancy ! James always did havea flair for the dramatic . - Ladies first . - What ? Uh , yeah , age before beauty . What ? He 's older than me . He 's older than both of usput together . All right , shut up . Hold that . Children.I 'm working with children . Okay ... hand that to me . - Be careful . - Here . Okay , don 't tilt it.I 've got my lunch in there . Okay . These are warehouse 13 cratesthere . Okay , it 's--it 's really bad again . - What is ? Your vibe ? - Yeah . About ... ? Yes . Well , when did youget it again ? As soon as we walkedin here.It just kicked mein the gut . Are you sure ? Yeah , that 's whyi 'm telling you . Yeah , but you can 't tell himunless you 're positive . Okay , stop , stop . What are you talking about ? What vibe ? About me ? - Yeah . - What about me ? Look , I don 't know . Artie , man , I hate this . - Just tell me exactlywhat you 're feeling . - It 's nothing . I mean , I don 't know yet . Look , artie , all I know isI got a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach . Well , when you geta really specific feeling , just let me know , will you ? You 'll be the first . Okay , look , down here ... see ? - Yeah . - I 'm gonna go down there alone . Yes.And I want you guysto go back around that way . - I think it meets uparound the other side . - No , no , no , no ! Artie ! Artie ! Artie ! No ! We shouldn 't split up . Look , if he really is planningan ambush , don 't you think it 's best thatwe 're not all caught up in it ? He does have a point.He has a point . Artie ! Keep your tesla handy . I 'm fine . Go . I don 't want to tell youanything more about it because I 'd prefer not to haveany competition with anybody . It 's all true . I 've seen itwith my own eyes . A man rose from the ashes to survive the blastof a furnace . And seeing truly isbelieving . - Wouldn 't you say ? - Gentlemen , thank you all so muchfor joining me here today . Mr.Pak , how are your ears ? A little better ? How 's your vibe now ? - Not good . - It 's nice to see you . As mr.Freitag hastold you all ... - what 's he doing ? - I don 't know . The priceof this particular item at 20 million , U.S.Currency. Okay , possibilities.Um , artie knockedmacpherson out and is pretendingto take his place . Yeah , but they knew him.They called him " mr.Nielsen. " No , macpherson has some kindof mind control over artie . Well , it 's a strange wayto use it . - Well ... - okay , pete ... what if artie 's trading in30 years at the warehouse for $ 20 million ? Or ... oh , snap ! Artie is macpherson . Uh , no . Ohcome on , you don 'tactually believe that , do you ? Hold it right there , buddy ? Yeah , yeah , stay-stay there untilwe figure this out . Cut it out , you two.That 's not me.I 'm me . I 'll make an exception . How are we supposedto know that ? Look . Security cameras . So ? He 's setting me up.He tried to do ita few weeks ago with honjo masamune . You don 't remember ? He went after the swordplus he dug up my past . I was arrested for treason ! This time he 's gonnamake sure it sticks . That must be why mrs.Fredericsounded so strange . Oh , so what , did he go outand get an artie suit ? Huh ? How do we know thatyou 're not him pretending to be you ? The thimble . You really did readthe whole manual , didn 't you ? I did . What--what thimble ? Harriet tubman 's thimble . She wore it as she stitchedthe rags of her fellow slaves . It became imbued with her dreamof a better life . And it developed propertiesof light refraction , so that people saw an imagedifferent from the image of the personwearing the thimble . It came in very handyfor the underground railroad during the civil war . All right , well , let 's justgo in and blast him . No , no , no , no , no , no . No , he 's expecting that . Well , what 's he notexpecting ? This--I didn 't--no . No.There 's no way . Claudia.Claudia ! Leena ... mrs.Frederic , this place is my home . I would never do anythingto hurt any of you , least of all artie . We know you wouldn 'T.Not on purpose . What does that mean ? Do you think he putsome kind of bug in my brain or something ? There are any numberof methods to create sleeper agents . Apparently macphersonhas amassed quite a collectionof warehouse artifacts . Then torture me . You people do that.You 've gotta have some kindof truth serum laying around here somewhere . Pump me full of it . Read me ! Read my colors.Tell my fortune . Whatever it is you do , you can tell , right ? Yes , I can . And I have . Claudia , I 'm sorry , but something is wrong . Oh , my god . I 'm like the freakin manchurian candidateor something . What the hell ! Let her go . For the time being it 's bestif she weren 't in the warehouse . - What if she disappears ? - She 's being watched . I 've never seen herthis upset before . That 's what made jamessuch an excellent agent . He 'd get inside your head , throw you off your game . Just when you thoughtyou had the upper hand , he 'd strike . 48 million going once ... twice ... sold to mr.Pak. And when I get confirmation thatthe money is in our account , then the phoenixwill be yours . Wrong again , arthur . Remember these ? Gentlemen , this next itemis something that we went to a great dealof trouble to acquire . Edgar allen poe 's notebook , and his pen . Together they give their ownerthe unique ability to make what they writeactually happen . - What is that ? - It 's a fire alarm . - We must get out of here . - There 's no need to panic . Mr.Nielsen , I 'd rather not be here when the authorities arrive . Excellent point . Next time , mr.Nielsen. Gentlemen ... federal agents ! Don 't bother ! I 'm sorry you went to all thattrouble getting poe 's pen . I guess you wasted your timeattacking my family . Okay , pal , time for youto finally get yours . Just don 't kill him . He 's an excellent bodyguard.I 'd hate to lose him . Wha-who the hell - james macpherson , you 're under arrest . Aren 't you adorable ? You didn 't really think it wasgonna be that easy , did you ? Do you rememberour old friend erik ? He made those wonderfulimplosion grenades , which I demonstrated for youa few weeks ago . Before his untimely death , I had him bring back yet another old favorite--the eggshell bomb . This time with a pinch of promethium . If the slightest pressurecracks the shell , it results in a smallnuclear reaction . Small but dazzling . Carson . Now , you two dropthose little toys of yours or arthur will losehis footing . Thank you . Jaw getting tired , arthur ? It won 't be long now . You were a warehouse agent . What the hell happenedto you ? 15 years of exile . And now I wantto give arthur back the gift he gave me . But unfortunately , you 're going to be tried for your crimes ... posthumously.You think ? In your soul , you believe as I do . That 's the vibeyou 've been feeling . How do you knowwhat I 'm feeling ? Because I know you , peter lattimer , better than you know yourself . I was you . Shall I tell you the thought that crosses your mindoccasionally ? What if these artifactsreally do belong out in the world , instead of being locked upby a gang of autocratic regentswho see the universe through the blindersof their own bureaucracy ? Walk out of herewith me now ... and follow what you knowto be true in your soul . That 's a nice speech . It sounds even betterwith the fancy accent . - But it still doesn 't coverthe fact that - you are out of your gourd , mcnutty-pants ! You put a bombing a man 's mouth . Not really a greatrecruiting tool . Fair enough . Well , I 'll be sayinggood-bye , then . You expect us to justlet you walk out of here ? No , no , I expect you to die while you 're tryingto save arthur . And I 'd say he 's gotabout ... 30 seconds . Hey , mac . Good catch . So we 're never turning him into the government ? The government ? I don 't think so . He 's already proventhat prisons can 't hold him . So then , what happens to him ? I mean , we 're not going to , you know ... no , no , no , no.Although he would happilykill all of us without blinking an eye . No , we don 't operatelike that . We 'll put himin the bronze sector . Arthur , I 'm honored . Okay , I promiseto read the manual this weekend , but what--what is the bronze sector ? Actually , I don 't rememberthat being in the manual . The bronze sector , children , is where the mostdangerous people in history have been , um ... what 's the generous phrase ? Preserved . Yes , preserved . People whose removalfrom society had to be certain . They 're put in the bronzesector . Locked for all eternityin warehouse 13 ? How poetic . Even a twisted mindcan be an artifact . Let 's go . Aren 't you forgettingsomething ? Uh , not that I canthink of . My blood.If I remember correctly , my veins will burstupon entry . I say we give it a try , see what happens . James ... what a bittersweet reunion.You 've aged . Mrs.Frederic , you haven 'T . You must tell meyour secret . Perhaps on a warm summer dayover tea . Perhaps not . All this timeyou 've had them . How simple . I wish I 'd thought of it . What are those ? Crystalline diamondswith a trace of palladium . Palladium ? It neutralizes the mineralsin his blood . So he doesn 't go kablooey . Unfortunately . That is a load off my mind . Good-bye , james . Yeah . Let 's go . So why is the bronze sectornot in the manual ? No , no , no , it 's far too dangerous for there to bea written record . If someone were to findthis place , somehow reverse the process-the point is we don 't wantthese people out in the world . So this place is filledwith , like , the worst guys ever , right ? Hitler , mussolini , michael vick . No , no , these aremen and women who would have become hitlersand mussolinis or worse , except ... we got to them first . A room filled with evilthat you 've never heard of . Seems so unfair . No , this is a processthat was first explored in ... mesopotamia . - In 1230 b- - uh , 50 . 1250 B.C. Anyway , the bronzing processwas too heavy , and it kind of cracked open-let 's just sayit was unsuccessful . Here , what we do is we flash-freeze the bodiescryogenically , and we preserve themby bronzing . Unfortunately ... it 's a painless process . Really ? How many timeshave you tried it ? It 's about as painfulas a sword in the chest . Touche . What a beautiful creature . A farewell gift , arthur ? You shouldn 't have . Just ignore the monsterin the cage . Pete and myka , the stolen artifacts have been loaded in . Can I get your helpreplacing them ? Fine by me . I 'd rather not see this . Oh , wait , come on.I want to watch this . When 's the next time somethinglike this is gonna happen ? Hopefully never . Who says you can nevergo home again , eh , arthur ? James . You know , I thought I 'd havea lot more to say to you . Good-bye , james . Arthur ... we can still be partners . Pleading for your life ? That 's out of characterfor you . I 'm not pleadingfor my life . I 'm pleading for yours . You know , maybe I shouldgo check on artie . I 'm sure he 's fine . You know what , I 'll go check . I 'll be back in a second . What a waste . Gonna go downtown with my baby ' cause she looks so - Turn around . My dear , thank youfor remembering our appointment . Oh , that is a relief ! Wave to arthur so he can enjoythe tape later . We 're clear . You won 't be needing thatanymore . So was it all worth it ? Unfettered accessto warehouse 13 ? Time will tell . There 's work to be done . The codes I implanted whenarthur tried to access my site need to be activated . Go on . Tempus fugit . Late , as usual . How did you--get away from there ! Or what ? You 've had your chance , arthur ! So many chances ! Go ahead , fire it ! You see , there 's a way aroundalmost anything ... partner ! No ! Artie.Artie ! Artie ! Can you hear me ? Artie ! Get up ! Artie.Artie ! Artie ! Get up ! Pete , hurry ! Look out . * * * James , wait ! * * sync.gioni666

 Somebody just walked over my grave . - Where is she ? - I don 't know . - Sarah Jane Smith . - Never heard of her . - Get out of my house . - This isn 't your house ! - Get out ! - I 'm gonna sort things out . I 'm gonna work out how time got changed , I 'm gonna find Sarah Jane , and then I 'm gonna bring her back . - There 's a huge meteor heading for Earth . - Is there ? Only Sarah Jane can stop it and she 's vanished . Pleased to meet you , Maria . I 'm Sarah Jane Smith . - And you 're Andrea Yates ? - So what if I am ? I don 't know you , how come you know me ? July 13th , 1964 . I 've gone back in time . Sarah Jane , I will know you . - She 's a loony . Leave her alone . - Don 't be so mean . If you 're lost , I 'll take you to our teacher . - We 're not going back , it 's boring . - You 're going down the pier ? Now ? It 's closed but we 'll get through . I want to explore . - But you mustn 't ! - What ? Sarah Jane , you 've got to believe me . You mustn 't go down there ! - Why not ? - July 13th , 1964 . It 's today , the accident , it 's about to happen . I shouldn 't be here , but I was travelling with this thing . It 's too complicated to explain . I broke free and ended up here 'cause this was the last place he came to , 'cause he was here in 1964 . He must have been , he swapped you two over . - I 'm not getting any of this . - There 's nothing to get , she 's creepy . Just listen to me . It 's not safe ! Go back , find your mates , just get back on the coach to school , go home ! I told you she was mad . Now come on , leave her ! - Where 'd she go ? - Who cares ? What a creep . She said we shouldn 't . - Sarah Jane , don 't be so dull ! - But she was scared . It 's weird , I sort of believed her . You 'd believe a Triffid 's gonna come and get us ! Just follow me , I 'll look after you . - Where is this ? You tell me . Oh ! - I thought I 'd never see you again ! - It 's so good to see you . - I was all on my own . - Where are we ? - Is this a different planet ? - I don 't think we 're anywhere at all . - We 're in limbo . - What does that mean ? It 's nowhere . It 's nothing , Maria . We 're lost . But you came here earlier to see her . It 's our daughter , she 's disappeared ! This isn 't funny , Alan . We never had kids . She 's about that high , she 's got dark hair like me , and she 's beautiful ... Are you getting some kick out of this ? There is no Maria ! This is cruel , now stop it . Maybe if there had been , we wouldn 't have split up . But it 's too late for that now . - It 's this box . - Oh , you 're full of nonsense , you are . You stay here . I 'm going to Andrea 's birthday party , although she 's real flesh and blood , Alan , so probably not your type . Oh ! You should make this into a utility room . - This was her bedroom . - Alan , stop it . She said something protected her . What if this protected her ? If we 've got a daughter , where is she ? Look . The day you moved in . Andrea came to help , I took the photo . You and her and me . No one called Maria . - Maria was telling the truth . - Oh , this is why ! People say , " He 's gorgeous , why did you split ? " This just brings it all flooding back ! What if there 's meant to be Maria and someone else ? A woman called Sarah Jane Smith . Andrea Yates . Oh , I could never forget . When I was 13 , we were on a school trip . We went onto the pier . She fell and there was nothing I could do . I always thought , " That could have been me . " But now she 's alive , like she 's always been alive . - What sort of woman is she ? - Bit full-on , likes a party . Yeah , that sounds like her . So , in the parallel world , you died and she lived . It 's not a parallel world , if only . It 's our timeline and it 's been changed . But without you , that meteor must still be on its way . It 's gonna smash into the Earth . If I 'm not there , that means the end of the world . I was the only one that knew about it . I got protected somehow by that box . Box ! The Verron soothsayer must have known this was going to happen . He said , " Give it to the person you trust the most . " It linked us somehow . I could sense you searching for me . I called out to you . But I dropped it , I lost it . That little alien thing came along and I ran . - Did he do all this ? - No . That alien , he 's called a Graske . There was Graske activity on Earth a couple of years back , but this isn 't their style at all . - What do you mean ? - This is much more powerful . Some other creature must be using the Graske as a slave . Sarah Jane ... - Who 's that ? Sarah Jane ... - I 'm being summoned . Maria , you stay here . - Don 't leave me on my own . Oh , I 'll come back . I promise . I 'll never leave you , Maria , never . Have you got that ? Just wait . Sarah Jane ... - Thank you for coming . - Thank you for inviting me . Wouldn 't be the same without you . Hello , Joan , how are you , love ? Go and find a drink . - Den , lovely to see you . - Hiya . I take it this is your domain ? Who are you ? Nobody . I am nothing . - Any chance you could be a bit less cryptic ? - It 's hard for me to make you understand . Ephemeral minds are so limited . Behold . As you can see , I have no self . I exist only to bring disorder . That is my purpose . - But why ? - Chaos is my blood and air and food . You are the key to that chaos . I have been waiting , searching through time , for just the right person at just the right moment . I took you to aid the coming of darkness . - Where 's Luke ? Where is my son ? - The Bane never came to Earth in the timeline that I have created . Luke Smith never existed . People who don 't exist end up here , don 't they ? So where is he ? I demand to see my son ! He is lost in the forgotten places , even further out than you . But if I died all those years ago ... Never mind the Bane . What about the Slitheen , Gorgons , Patriarchs of the Tin Vagabond ? I stopped them from taking over the Earth . - What happened to them ? - I turned them all away . - All I need is the meteor . - Why ? What 's so special about that ? Those other species , they invade for profit , power , revenge . The meteor is pure chaos . The destruction of the Earth , for no reason at all . Just blind chance . This is food for me . You 'll destroy all life on Earth and you don 't even care ? I care about you . You are so wonderful , Sarah Jane Smith . Your life was so important and I found the right moment to snuff it out , with the help of Andrea Yates . - Andrea was my friend . - She wished to save her own life . I could only remove you with her consent . - She agreed to it ? - I must go now . Events are moving towards their end . - No , don 't go . - I will return when the Earth is no more . And I will explore your potential further . In particular , your memories of this Doctor . - You leave him alone ! - I can use you to find him . Imagine if the Doctor had never existed . What chaos there would be across the stars . Don 't you dare ! Don 't you dare ! Don 't you dare ! That 's lovely ! Tell your mum thanks . I 'm sorry she couldn 't make it . - I 'll be off . - No , no , stick around . Here , have a bit of cake ! Okay , no complaints from me ! Well , look who 's here ! Hello , love , welcome . Oh , Alan , still not found anyone ? He is mine . More gorgeous every day . If I was a few years younger . Ah , you can have him . What 's the matter , Alan , cat got your tongue ? You could say that . Clyde , don 't put that modern stuff on . - Let it play . - This stuff 's ancient . Not to me , it isn 't . It 's like yesterday . Oh , the ' 60s . That was my time . I was just a kid back then . - You okay ? - I heard what it said . And the meteor 's coming . - We can 't do anything . - There must be something . There 's always something . - My dad ? - What can he do ? He didn 't remember me . Now you 've been taken out of time , he won 't remember you , either . You what ? Danny , are you serious ? All right , I 'll check it out . - Clyde , not again . - My mate said there 's something on the news . Can we turn on the telly ? - You kids and your TV . It 's meant to be a party ! - I won 't be a minute . The huge meteor , which was sighted at 2.15 p. m . , is heading towards Earth at colossal speed , but scientists are stressing that the situation is being closely monitored . - No need to panic . - That 's what Danny said ! - There 's this huge rock headed for Earth . - A meteor . It 's all true . - Is it gonna hit us ? - No , Danny said it 's gonna fly past . Nothing 's going to spoil my birthday ! We need more glasses . - I 'll give you a hand . - Andrea , now 's your chance . Well , I 'll bring him back if he 's good . Now , I 've got some paper cups somewhere . Saves wear and tear . Where did I put them ? - What does the name Maria mean to you ? - Oh , I don 't know . Ave Maria . Maria Callas . Maria who works down the petrol station . Which Maria ? My daughter , Maria . Where is she ? - I don 't know what you mean . - You do ! You remember . So do I. Whatever you 've done , I 'm gonna get her back ! - You mustn 't , please . - Is it you ? You 're the centre of it . I know about the accident , about Sarah Jane . What are you talking about ? You got me out of the way , then she was gone ! I asked you to help me with my banner ... - Where 'd you get that ? - What have you done to her ? The whole world 's forgotten her . - It 's your word against mine . - I haven 't forgotten . This box , it protected Maria , and now it 's protected me . I was gonna forget . He promised me . One night 's sleep and I 'd have forgotten her . Who ? Who promised you ? Come on , tell me ! Where is she ? - You 'd never believe me . - I think I would . Andrea , please . Tell me . It was years ago . I was 13 . I thought I was so grown-up . Knew it all . Indestructible , that 's what I was . And I had this friend ... Oh , Alan , I 'm so sorry . I had this friend called Sarah Jane Smith . If I 've come all the way to the seaside , I wanna see the flaming sea ! We 're due back at the bus . Jeffers will skin us ! We larked about for a bit . Then I went to the edge . There was nothing there . Andrea ! Andrea ! Andrea , grab my hand ! Grab my hand , come on , Andrea . Come on , come on , grab my hand . I tried and tried , but I couldn 't hold on . Andrea , come on , hold my hand ! And then I heard the voice . Andrea . You don 't have to die . I can save you . Somebody has to fall , it doesn 't have to be you . You only have to agree . Help ! Help ! I need your answer or I can 't help . Let her die in your place ? Yes , yes ! - Andrea , help me ! - What happened ? Sarah Jane ! Sarah , take my hand , take my hand . Sarah , take my hand ! She was just a kid . My gift to you , Andrea . Same as yours . You will forget , so that you will live a full life . But waking or sleeping , I will always be with you , Andrea Yates . Always . I remembered the accident , but he made me forget everything else . I never knew where I got this . But somehow I could never throw it away . When Maria came over this morning shouting about Sarah Jane , it all came back . The voice , the deal I did . - Sacrificing your friend to save your own life . - I was 13 , I was terrified . Do you know what it 's like to know you 're going to die ? To feel the end of everything closing in on you ? Why am I even asking ? I 'm the only person alive who could possibly know . - She was your friend ! - Yes , and I loved her . I did . Don 't look at me like that . Oh , she was funny . I used to crack up , the things she said . Clever , not swotty . In class , she didn 't have to try . Alan , I had to do it . I had to survive . The minute you remembered , you did it again , to Maria ! If I didn 't have this box , I would have forgotten my own daughter . - I had to send her away . - What could Maria do to you ? She made me remember . She made me face what I had done . What do you want me to do , Andrea ? And yeah , now I 've done it again . Sent your daughter away . And how can I face that ? - I can send him away too , but you must agree . - I agree , I agree ! - Agree to what ? - I 'm so sorry . The meteor is on collision course with Britain , but the RAF has released a statement saying they are confident it can be shot down , and missiles are already being prepared . - This is amazing . - Let the army deal with it , it 's what they get paid for . Wonder what 's keeping Alan . Well , that 's just ridiculous . My ex-husband and a dwarf in a suit , now I 've seen it all . Just shut up and listen ! The meteor is now approximately 10 minutes from impact , but hold on , we have some breaking news . I 'm being told ... It 's been confirmed . I 'm sorry . The missile strike has failed . It 's gonna hit us ! It 's gonna blow up the Earth ! Set me free ! Show me how to get my daughter back here . Now ! It 's a joke , it must be a joke . Can you hear it ? That 's it ! Come on ! It 's the end of the world . But it can 't be . Why is this happening now ? There it is ! They 'll find a way to deal with it . They 've got to . That 's real , though . There 's no way of stopping it ! Maria said Sarah Jane can stop the meteor . The snare will retrieve her . Then , you set me free ! Maria ! Maria ! There must be something somebody can do . - Maria ... - Maria ! Where 's Maria ? How could I forget Maria ? - Dad , you genius ! - No , no , no , listen ... The meteor , it 's heading straight for us . - We can stop it , but we need Sarah Jane . - I don 't remember Sarah Jane . Dad , trust me . You remembered me when I disappeared , yeah ? I remember Sarah Jane . She 's the only person who can save us ! - How ? She 's just a normal woman , isn 't she ? - She 's a lot more than that . Help me . We can get Sarah Jane back . Whatever you did with that thing , do it again ! - Nothing . Nothing . - I got put back here , where I belong . So , she 'll be where she belongs . Her attic . Freedom ! Please . You saved me once before , you can do it again . Please . No . Not you . - Mum ! - Oh , it 's too late , sweetheart . It 's too late for all of us . I 'm sorry . All the times I let you down , sorry ! Not now ! Andrea Yates . It 's you . All grown up . Well , look at you . Scrubbed up well . Always did look younger than you were . But you can 't be here , not while I 'm here , you can 't come back . - Sarah Jane ! - That 's her ? She 's only in the mirror . This didn 't work . I can 't get back while Andrea 's here . And I must get back , to save Luke . To save the world ! - But what do we do ? - There is a way . It 's why the creature got rid of Maria . She confronted you , might have persuaded you to go back on your deal . This whole thing depends upon your agreement to my death all those years ago . If you break off the deal , Sarah Jane comes back . - All you have to do is pull out of it , say no ! - I can 't ! If you don 't , that meteor 's gonna hit ! Is that what you want ? I 'm sorry , Andrea , but you were meant to die . Meant ? Who says I 'm meant to die ? I was so young , I had so much to do , and I did it , look at me . I lived every single moment , - ' cause I knew what it was worth . - So did I. - And you 're the chosen one , the golden girl ? - Oh , nobody was chosen . It was stupid what happened that day , but this is worse ! That thing twisted it , he used you ! So I die , at 13 . And my son gets a chance to live . He 's lost out there , Andrea , somewhere terrible , and I am begging you , please save him . If I do , what happens to my life ? All the things I did as I grew up , they get scrubbed out ? I get forgotten ? No , you were never forgotten , never . What I saw that day , it changed me forever . I saw how precious life is . And it made me fight to defend it all these years . Because of you , Andrea . It was all because of you . My best friend . - Is that him ? The Trickster ? - Dad , no , don 't go near him . Andrea Yates . They want to kill you all over again . Remember your bargain with me . You tricked me ! You used a child . - And now you 're destroying the Earth ! - Chaos is good . Well , I say no . If there 's one thing I can do with my life , I can put a stop to you . I 've changed my mind ! I 'm taking the deal back ! Then you will die . I 've been dead for 40 years . Been a good life . It 's my birthday . Bye , Sarah Jane . I 'm going now . And you 're free ! Andrea ! Grab my hand , grab my hand . - Grab my hand , Andrea ! - Remember me . No ! I 'm back . We 're back , all of us ! Back where we belong . That felt like a spatiotemporal shift caused by extra quantum forces . - In English ? - Oh , it 's all back to normal ! - The meteor ! - It 's still coming ! Sarah Jane , do something ! - Thirty seconds to impact . - Mr Smith , I need you ! Emergency measures required . I know ! Luke , steady the magnetic buffer . - Done ! - Come on ! Right , Mr Smith , activate ! She did it ! She did it ! Like Bobby Sue had anything to do with that . You 'll be telling me she invented the zip fastener next . Meteor K67 has been deflected . - Never mind that , you 're back . - Was I away ? And you are never , ever , ever going away again ! - What just happened ? - A friend of mine just saved the world . Her name was Andrea Yates . Oh ! That was brilliant , we did it , you should 've seen it . What 's he doing here ? Right . Aliens , monsters , supercomputers . Is anybody going to tell me what 's going on ? Come on . I need some answers . Who 's going first ? It 's been five months since we saw Ashley . Mr Smith , I need you , more than ever . I told you , there 's something wrong with that woman . Ashley , oh , my God ! - I wish I had all the answers . - No ! We 're part of something bigger than living on Bannerman Road . You 've got powerful friends . I told you when we met . My life is dangerous . This is serious stuff , Maria . Crazy , but serious . Dad says we 're moving . Says I can 't have anything to do with you . Sometimes it 's the only way to survive .

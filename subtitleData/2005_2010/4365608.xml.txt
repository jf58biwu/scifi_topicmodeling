 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ... Dr. Boyd Sherman , child psychologist , family therapist . What 's his link to Skynet ... Friend or foe ? - Jesse . - Hey , baby . Are you AWOL ? Jesse , did you run from the war ? I need a place to rest . What 's next ? We 'll come back and bring something with us to destroy it . I 'm gonna be sick . - What 's wrong with her ? - I don 't know . - She 's burning up . - I 'm fine . Is she pregnant ? Why in the hell would you even ask that ? Kacy vomited when she was pregnant . You 're vomiting . It 's morning . - That 's when it happens . - Just shut up . It 's a bug or something . Stomach flu or something . We 'll be home soon , okay ? Here . Wait . How do you feel ? How do I look ? Like crap . I wish I felt that good . - What 's that ? - It 's rehydration fluid . Drink one cup every half hour or right after you vomit . Where are you going ? We have to go back now . - Back where ? - Mexico . There 's thermite in the garage . We need to burn Cromartie 's body . Cromartie 's dead . You have to incinerate him , John . To be sure . He 's buried in the middle of a desert , and his chip has been obliterated . - I think we 're pretty ... - Safe ? It 's not safe . Oh , God , she 's starting to sound like you . She 's right . I need to see you . Now . Bring a gun . I was over at the shopping mall this morning , right ? And I just ... I don 't know . I can 't stop eating Chinese food . So I 'm there , and I 'm just waiting for my food , and I look across the way , and I see him . I just see him . You see him who ? Fischer . I see Fischer . - Who 's Fischer ? - Charles Fischer . I don 't know who you 're talking about . You do . You know him . Charles Fischer , sent back from the future , and he works for the machines . And he 's gonna die . - What are you doing ? - Feeling what it 's like to get away . I don 't think you are . - What do you mean ? - If by feelings you mean emotions , I 'm pretty sure you still don 't have any of those . And if by feeling you mean what it feels like to have the wind blow through your toes or your hair ... I 'm pretty sure you can 't feel that either . I don 't think you understand how we work . I have sensation . I feel . I wouldn 't be worth much if I couldn 't feel . - So go through this again . - I 've gone through it again . - One more time . - I told you . - I 'm at the mall ... - Just skip to where you follow this man to the parking garage and hit him with a brick . He 's a Grey . Tell me you remember the Greys . Of course I remember the Greys . They were traitors . They worked for Skynet . - Helped the trip-eights act more human . - You don 't remember him ? He was on the top of the list . Tell him ! Tell him who you are and why you 're here ! I don 't know what you 're talking about . My name is Paul Stewart . That 's my license . Look at my license . Please . I 'm not who she says I am ! - Liar ! - It 's a mistake ! For your sake , brother , I hope you 're right . Episode 209 : Complications v 1.00 I told you . I repair watches . I have a shop in Pasadena . That 's my license . What are you doing here , Fischer ? I was looking for an Omega . 321 movement . There 's a secondhand store . Tin cans didn 't send him back here to fix watches . I think we all know that . Why don 't you save us the trouble and tell us the truth ? Why are you here ? I 'm Paul Stewart , I live on Blackburn Avenue . Your name is Fischer . - You work for Skynet . - Skynet ? No . What are you doing here , you murdering bastard ! Do I know you ? No , you don 't know me , and I don 't know her . I don 't . For the love of God , I 'm not Charles Fischer . I 'm not . - I need you to be sure . - Of what ? - Him . - I am sure . You don 't trust me ? It 's not that I don 't trust you . It 's ... I knew the Greys . Jesse , I knew them just like you did . They were war criminals . We caught four of them ? Right , but we couldn 't find Fischer . They kept him hidden . Too valuable . You really don 't remember ? Listen , if he is who you say he is , then he deserves whatever is gonna happen to him in that room , but not until he tells us who he is and what he 's doing here . Do you understand ? - He is who I say he is . - I want to hear him say it . He will . I 'll show you . - Where 's the rest of him ? - It 's not here . Not possible . We destroyed his chip . He didn 't walk out of here , but he 's gone . There 's only one other person who knew about this . And only one other person crazy enough to dig him up . You hungry ? Not hungry . You a vegetarian ? No , I just ... I don 't know what 's in that . Cheeseburger 's in that . Eat . Where 's your friend ? Out . I 'm not who she thinks I am . I sure hope not . I fix watches . I used to be an engineer , but it got old . I was just a guy in a cubicle with a bunch of other guys in cubicles , so I decided to go to Bern to learn ... watch repair . It 's in Switzerland . You ever been to Switzerland ? That 's a nice story . You don 't believe me . I 've told a few myself . Is she your girlfriend , this woman ? Do you love her ? It 's complicated . Well , I know complication . I 'm a watchmaker . It 's a ... It 's a watch joke . If I were you , I 'd eat . Listen to me . People do crazy things when they 're in love . Well , I do . But this is insane . She says that you know me , and clearly you don 't know me . There 's something wrong with her . So what 'd they get you for ? Did you hear what I just said ? It 's prison ink . - Where 'd you do time ? - I haven 't done any time . Yes , you have . No , it 's a ta ... It 's a tattoo , 'cause I fi ... I fix watches . It 's a clock . With no hands . It means till the end of time . Life sentence . If I had a life sentence , what would I be doing here ? That 's what I 'm trying to figure out . Lunch is over . - Hello ? - Hey . It 's Derek . - Is it ? - Yeah , I know . Shocks the hell out of me , too . Listen , I need to talk ... Hello ? I need to talk to you . - So talk . - I 'm sending a picture to your phone . I got it . - Who is it ? - I don 't know . You 've never seen him ? He 's not in your memory banks or whatever ? There 's no record of him ? No . Who is he ? He 's ... He 's just this guy . I thought maybe I knew him . He looks hurt . Don 't worry about it . - Who was that ? - Derek . Derek . What 'd he say ? Is everything okay ? Is mom okay ? Everything 's okay . Don 't worry about it . Can I help you ? I was waiting . I heard ... - Do you remember me ? - Of course I remember you . I have ... It 's possible I have an emergency . You came to my office over a month ago , and you said your son needed help ... Therapy . I never saw either of you again . Wait . Dr. Sherman , please . I 've had some bad luck with shrinks . Well , you could stop calling them shrinks ... That might help . - Sorry . - It 's okay . My assistant will be here tomorrow morning at 7 : 00 . - Make an appointment . - I 'm here now . Sarah , make an appointment , please . We 'll see what we can do . I 've been sick ... Flu or something . I 'm exhausted . I can 't sleep , and when I do , I have dreams . Nightmares , actually . I walk in my sleep . Where are you walking to ? - What do you mean ? - I mean , where do you go when you walk ? I 'm chasing someone , or I 'm being chased . But where do you go ? Out . I get the hell out . You 're here . Come on in . There are many things I don 't understand . Like what ? The tortoise . What tortoise ? It was on its back by the side of the road in Mexico . Your mother turned it over . She was helping it . I know . But why ? 'Cause that 's what we do . When we ... When we see something that 's in pain , or in trouble , or whatever , we try and help it . Empathy . Something like that . But not everyone would turn the tortoise over . No . Some would just leave it there . Some would probably drive over it and crush it . Yeah , I guess they would . Is that what you 'd do ? It didn 't seem like much of a threat . We 're not built to be cruel . Yeah , that 's one for cyborgs . Yes . That 's one for us . - What are you doing ? - The body is gone . - What ? - Cromartie 's body is gone . Impossible . You are the only one who knew where we buried it . We need it . We have to destroy it . What would I possibly want with it ? - He 's lying . - You don 't know that . Please , John . If you know , you better tell me right now . I don 't know . I don 't know . Let him go . - Why ? - He 's telling the truth . - We could find out for certain . - Let him go . Sorry . What the hell ? He doesn 't wanna tell us who he is . - I brought proof . - Proof ? Please , please don 't hurt me . - Don 't hurt me , please . - That 's up to him . - Who 's he ? - Who are you ? My name is Charlie Fischer . You were at my job ... SRF . We do seismic retrofitting . I 'm a service technician . That 's all . I 'm nobody . I don 't even know what I 'm doing here . Tell him who you are . I 've already told you who I am . This is a trick , some crazy trick , and you 're all in on it , and you too . What do you want from me ? ! I want you ... to tell me ... - the truth ! - Oh , God ! If he is who you say he is ... - He is ! - All right , fine . He is . We need to know what he 's doing here . - Unless he 's AWOL , like you . - He 's not . Not this guy , not Charles Fischer . He 's been sent back by them for a reason . You need to beat the hell out of him . You need to get him to talk . No , please . I 'm sorry , really . Don 't hurt the boy . Don 't ... Some people , you can beat them and beat them , and they 'll take it . Whatever pain you give them , they absorb it , like it was theirs all along , and you 're giving it back to them . You see , deep down , they hate themselves , and they use that hate to eat the pain . See , we were all good once . We all loved ourselves once , as young men trying to get through the day , or as kids playing in the park . Stop it , stop it , stop it , stop it . My name is Charles Fischer . I 'm Charles Fischer . Now let him go . He 's got nothing to do with this . Just let him go . This is impossible ! Can 't you people see that this is insane ? Why are you here ? - Why did they send you back ? - They didn 't . I 'm not here on a mission . Nobody comes back without a mission . This is my reward . When the bombs dropped , I was locked up in Pelican Bay . Solitary confinement . Life sentence . If I hadn 't been in prison , I never would 've made it through Judgment Day . Once they got their hands on me , it was either I teach them everything I learned inside or say good-bye . And what 'd you learn ? I learned what makes people tick . So the fever that brought on the dreams was caused by something you ate , you think , in Mexico . - What were you doing in Mexico ? - Vacation . Family vacation ? Has anything happened since I saw you last ? - What do you mean ? - I mean , have you suffered a trauma ? Has there been a crisis in the family , something more between you and John since I 've seen you last ? I came to you for help in understanding my dreams . Well , the problem is , without knowing the details of your life , I 'm not sure what I can tell you , beyond generalities . I can tell you that dreams tend to mirror the central conflict in the dreamer . Would it be accurate to say that the central conflict in your life is your son ? And your daughter , you have less conflict with . - It 's different with her . - What is ? Conflict , type of conflict , the nature of your relationship , what ? - Everything . - Specifically . I don 't want to talk about her . Then why are you here ? I mean , you come in here pretending to want to talk about your dreams , and refusing to talk about John and Cameron , which , in my opinion , is what your obsession with the three dots is all about . So if you only want to talk about one of those dots , there 's not much I can do . I have no one else to talk to . Nothing is going to happen in here until you decide to be honest . You seem surprised . Judgment Day ... Machines ... You have no idea what you 'd do . What 's the hardest decision you 've ever had to make ? Whether to stay with Rebecca or take a chance on Christine ? Whether to ask for time off for grandfather 's funeral because you 're too afraid you 'll be fired if you just take it ? You think you know who you are ? You don 't have a clue . Can 't you just tell them what they want to know ? What does it matter now ? You 're here . You 're safe . Are you ? No , he 's playing with us , he 's making us think he 's weak . - He 's not weak . - How do you know ? I know , all right ? I know . You may not remember , but I know . He is the worst of them . He 's the worst . He needs to die . Forget why he 's here . Forget whatever the mission is . He just needs to die . What did he do ? Jess , what did he do to you ? There was a raid on a bunker . Metal was everywhere . They took out our command , killed everyone over 30 , killed the children . They took the prisoners to this place . He was there . He said he was gonna teach them how to talk to people , how to get information from people , how to be people . It was a kind of perverse theater , like ... like he was teaching them . How long did it go on ? Weeks . Months . There were drugs ... and starvation . And he talked to you ... for hours ... for days ... Just to break you down , just to get to your in ... to get to you . How 'd you get out ? I don 't know . You never told me . What ? It wasn 't me Fischer had , baby . It was you . Go to hell . You don 't remember . I can 't believe you don 't remember . But it was you . My name is Derek Reese , first lieutenant , 132nd SOC . - Yeah , well , good for you . - Not for you . - I told you I 'm not on a mission . - I don 't care . You remember . You remember now . I was wondering how long that was gonna take . No , I don 't remember . But she does , and that 's good enough for me . You gonna kill me ? Not you . Oh , God . Thank you . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to wake you . I wasn 't sleeping . Just needed to close my eyes for a few minutes . How you feeling ? What does this mean to you ? I keep seeing it in my dreams , John . It means something . Mom , you 're tired . You 've been sick . Chasing killer robots will do that to you . We couldn 't find Cromartie 's body . It wasn 't there . It 's gone . - He doesn 't have it . - Are you sure ? I 'm sure . Cromartie was in my dreams . It 's connected . It 's all connected . Mom , you had a dream . It was my fault . What was your fault ? Cromartie ... I led him to you . What are you talking about ? There was this kid , a boy ... in the bowling alley . He was with the guys who broke into our house , and I sh ... I knew what I had to do , John . I didn 't do it . I let him go . Cromartie must 've found him . We 're not murderers . You 're not . Tell that to the boy . I 'm sure he 's dead . We have to find that body , John . You don 't think he 'll ... talk ... Young Fischer . We had to let him go . He 's not the monster we just buried . Let 's hope he doesn 't become one . Do you remember any of it ? Even a flash ? Nothing . It was all we talked about , Derek ... What he 'd done , how you were gonna find him one day . You were obsessed . It was a trauma . You 've blocked it . Maybe , maybe not . Maybe it never happened to me . I was there . Maybe I came from a future where it never happened , and now you 've come from a future where it did . Is that possible ? Ever since I 've been back here , I 've done ... things . I 've changed things . Maybe I changed the future . That 's why we 're here , isn 't it ? To change the future . Do you think there 's a version of it where we 're not together ? FBI , Department of Homeland Security . Need you to come with us please . Two nights ago , you entered the building unauthorized at 4 : 16 AM . What were you doing here ? That 's a mistake . Two nights ago ? No . I wasn 't there . I would have no reason to be there at that time . Computers don 't lie , Mr. Fischer . At 4 : 23 , seven minutes after you entered the building , there was an unauthorized access to the computer networking system . That wasn 't me . This system allows user access to all primary military-industrial complex computer systems . I 'm telling you that this is all a big mistake . I do seismic retrofitting . I don 't know how to access a computer . Why would I do that ? I don 't know , Mr. Fischer . You tell me . Why would you install a roving back door into those computer systems ? One that we can 't dismantle so far . You want to tell us how to do that as well ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I wasn 't there . What happened to you ? You look a little banged up . Wanna explain that ? I don 't know if I can . Try . So ... what is it you wanted to show me ? We need to learn how they work ... How to fight them . We can 't allow history to repeat itself , not when we have the power to stop it . It 's up to us now ... The two of us . It is . What am I doing here ? I don 't know . It 's a waste of time . You just lie and lie . It 's a waste of time . - I just lie and lie . - Don 't you have things to do ? Yes , I do . I have things to do . I should get back to work .

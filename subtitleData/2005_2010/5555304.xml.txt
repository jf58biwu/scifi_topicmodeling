 Previously on Dollhouse ... I can 't beat you . The FBI kicked me out for trying . I want you to consider becoming Echo 's Handler . Everything 's gonna be all right . Now that you 're here . - She 's not gonna ... - Glitch ? She 's fine , Agent Ballard . My head is on fire . All you had to do was remember who you were ! I remember everything . I 've been many people . Do you know who 's real ? Caroline . Will you help me ? Goodness gracious , but it is good to be out-of-doors . It certainly is . And aren 't Little Sister and Aunt Sheila having a time , though ? What a healthsome and robust young lady you are , too . You better watch out , Aunt Sheila . Little Sister 's playing to win . No use in moaning about it . What ? Me ? Why , I 'd love to join . All right . Don 't think I 'll be much match for Little Sister . Now watch this drive . Aunt Sheila . It 's not very sportsmanlike to just walk off because you don 't like the way the game is going , is it ? Right when it 's my turn to play , everyone wants to quit . Well , not this time . Damn it , Aunt Sheila . This is not how we play the game . I guess we have to find a new Aunt Sheila . Echo ? Echo ? I 'm Echo . Uh-huh . Hi . I was looking for you . I 'm glad . Would you like a towel ? Yes , thank you . I 'm wet . - Good day . - A treatment . Would you like a treatment ? Yes , please . I enjoy my treatments . - Shall I dress ? - Yes . Dress would be good . Has Mr. Ballard been given his engagement ? He has . And any progress on locating our troubled missing employee ? She 's not really missing , is she ? She left . Well , I call that missing . I call that leaving . One doesn 't just leave this place . - Claire did . - Claire now , is it ? - Dr. Saunders . - Dr. Saunders ? - Where is Dr. Saunders , please ? - She 's not here , Victor . There is a man . He 's not his best . Dr. Saunders can help him . Thank you , Victor . We 'll help him . And we can also keep looking for Dr. Saunders , yes ? How 's the patient ? Not complaining , considering he was hit by a car . Have we determined yet if the condition is reversible ? I have to finish mapping his neural landscape , but if I can figure out a way to sneak up behind his reticular activating system and give it a goose , that might do it . It could also give him a man reaction . - I choose not to hear that . - Okay . Do we really want to wake this guy up ? Mr. Langton , have you no charity ? We are working to reunite a desperate family with their wayward loved one . And by wayward , do you mean that they 've been looking for him ever since he skipped his last bail hearing ? A bail hearing over a minor matter which has since been resolved . - And by resolved , do you mean ... - Yes , yes . A judge was bought off . There is no need to continue to translate me . In any event , Bradley Karrens is not only a valued client , he happens to be a major shareholder in our parent organization . If we can apply our resources to resolving his nephew 's slight medical condition , we do it . Report any progress . See ? We 're doing good . Uh-huh . Uh-oh . Boyd ? So your client is an Edmond Gossen . He 's a Liberal Arts professor at Clairfield College . Echo is being imprinted as one of his students . What 's the " R " stand for ? Oh , that 's the engagement designation . " R " means romance . As in R-rated ? Great . So she 's the sex fantasy for some egghead academic who can 't get one of his real students to sleep with him . - Don 't you just feel like dancing ? - Not overly . You know what it is ? Normally at this time , I 'm at yoga disco , so my body 's just sort of programmed to do this . She 's not wrong . What is it , Thursday ? Tell me I didn 't miss Gossen 's lecture . He 's hard enough to understand even when you 're there . You 're fine . Paul here is going to see to it that you get there on time . - Thanks , Paul . I 'm Kiki . - Kiki . First , Paul is gonna take you on a little spree . Shopping or killing ? Joke . Good news on the coma front ? Yeah . Good news is that he 's in a coma . - I beg your pardon ? - Just show her what you showed me . This is a brain , a healthy brain . Frankly , an overly smart brain . It 's my brain . And this is Terry Karrens ' brain . See these dark areas , how they extend all the way out to here ? You know why that looks like that ? That 's because Terry Karrens doesn 't use that part of his brain , and that 'd be where you find stored such things as empathy , compassion , an aversion to disemboweling puppies . Basically , this is what some of your more famous serial killers ' brains look like . You 're quite certain of this ? Certain enough that I have serious ethical problems trying to wake him up . Topher has ethical problems . Topher . Way to land it . Judith , get me Bradley Karrens . Hello . You 're new . And , of course , you 're always new . And who are we today ? - She 's Kiki . - Of course she is . Excuse me . Work order , Echo . Echo ? Echo ? Who 's doing that ? I am . Right , okay . So not exactly a rocket scientist . And normally that would be irony , but here , one never knows . Stacy , why don 't you take Miss Kiki here on back and stick her in the works ? Wait . Who 's gonna pay for this ? - Isn 't that cute ? On la casa . - Free ? Oui , oui . - Did I win a prize ? - You are a prize . - Come with me . - Oh , it 's ... How long is this gonna take ? Changing their insides is nothing . Zip zip . The outsides , that 's art . Art takes time . Magazine . I won 't even do this for my wife . I was trained at Quantico . Adelle , tell me there 's been a breakthrough . - Of a kind . - Can your people bring him back ? - Convince me why they should . - What ? Bradley , when you came to me with your request , you assured me that conventional medical science would fail to revive your nephew , that news of his condition would be a crushing blow to your brother , Terry 's father . - All true . - Yet somewhat incomplete . Yes ? I encourage candor . I have a team standing by to return him to Mercy . A return to mercy ? That has a poetry . All right . All right . All right . When I told you the doctor said he couldn 't be revived , that was true . Revived in time is what I neglected to add . In time for what ? Well , you are no doubt aware of Terry 's past , - his troubles with the law . - Minor offenses . What you know about is only what the family hasn 't been able to scrub . There have been other indiscretions . Women , survivors I should call them , and when you have a survivor , you have a person that might be persuaded , monetarily or by other means , to stay quiet . But when all you have are bodies ... - I see . - We can 't be certain , of course , but recent reports of abductions , missing persons might suggest ... Survivors ? Terry and I have always been close . If there are women out there , he 'd tell me . And I just know that if I can talk to him ... If he is to be questioned , we do it on my terms . - Oh , I just ... - My terms . That 's all . And I just love these . They 're my size . They 're just so ... I 'll take her . What ? I 'll cover your engagement . You 're staying here . Why ? It turns out we have a sudden need for an FBI profiler . - I suggested you . - For what ? To interrogate a possible serial killer . Serial killer ? Thank God . Car ! - Goodness gracious . - Hello , Terry . Hello ? I 'd like to know if I 'm being charged with something . You know you have to charge me with something eventually . I know my rights . How much does he know about who he is ? Where he is ? Straight brain dump . He is Terry Karrens . Right up to the moment he got hit by that car . I don 't understand why you won 't just let me speak with him . Mr. Ballard received his training from the FBI . He 's very experienced in these matters . We defer to him . These missing persons reports , why do you think he 's connected ? Just a hunch . No . It 's not a hunch . A 42-year-old woman from Covina , a 16-year-old girl from El Monte , a 20-year-old from Whittier and a 38-year-old from Alhambra . I don 't see a pattern here . For some reason , you do . Who are these women ? Who are they to him ? They were in a real sense nobody . The authors of some of the most important medieval literature had no concept of self-identity as we might understand it . We think of them as anonymous . They didn 't think of themselves at all . And I can see many of you would rather not be thinking of them , either . Okay . Your essays on the economics of love in Chaucer 's " The Wife of Bath " are being returned to you . If you have any questions or quibbles , my office is open . Excuse me . Professor , this can 't be right . - Miss Turner ? - Kiki . Okay , so I probably never should 've taken this course to begin with , but I figured it was Medieval Lit , not Advanced Evil , how hard could it be . So I skipped Intro to Evil or whatever . But how is it that I get an F when this guy that we 're reading , Chauncey , can 't even spell ? It 's Chaucer . It 's Middle English . Right . Like Hobbits or something . As I said , my office is open if you 'd care to discuss it . Yeah . I 'd care to discuss it . I 'm like the Scarlet lady with the " F " on her chest . - A. - Lf only . The detail is exquisite . - Huh ? - Chaucer 's detail . Alison is his most fully realized character . Well , then he sucks because I don 't get her . Really ? Because I think I can detect a little Alison in you . Yeah ? Hello ? These cuffs are digging into my wrists . I have no circulation . Hello ? Well , about time . Terry Marion Karrens ? - Any part of that a boy 's name ? - What ? So , Terry , I gotta ask , and I think you know I gotta ask , have you been practicing dentistry on large cats ? Leopards ? Pumas ? What ? I 'm just wondering why it is you have traces of a veterinary-grade paralytic in your system . I demand my phone call . I want my attorney present . No attorneys , no phone calls . - I know my rights . - And no rights . You are in big trouble . When my family finds out what you 're doing , you and this entire department ... - This isn 't a department . - What ? And I 'm not a cop . What do you mean ? Who are you then ? What is this place ? This is the place you 're not in . And I 'm the guy you 're not talking to . And these ... These are the women you 're gonna tell me how to find . I 've never seen any of these women before . Take another look , Terry . Uh ... Squint if you have to . I told you , I 've never seen these women before . I don 't know them . Let me help you out . Mother , Big Sis , Little Sis and Aunt Sheila . At least that 's how you know them . No . No , no , no , no , no . This is exactly the wrong approach to take with Terry . He needs to know you 're on his side . - But we 're not on his side . - Adelle , I know my nephew . And you should visit your nephew . Topher , escort Mr. Karrens downstairs where he can see for himself the care being provided . I 'm sure you 'll be impressed . He 's got his own private room . And we 've kept him very clean . You know , Terry , when I was first told that this is what you did , abducted women who look like the women you grew up with ... - Who told you that ? ... I figured , hell , this sick little twist must 've killed his family . It 's a whole Norman Bates thing . But , no . Your real mother and sisters and your aunt are all still living in the family home . You know what that makes you ? Very weird . - I 'm not weird . - No . No , you 're weird , Terry . But what you 're not is special . It doesn 't take a criminal profiler to figure you out . Maybe just a pimp . It 's ordinary . You 're ordinary . Maybe you got bottle fed . Maybe you got dumped . It doesn 't matter . At some point , you decided real people weren 't worth it . You pushed them away , alienated everyone in your life so you could surround yourself with the fakes , the copies . It made you feel like you had some control . You 're not in control . Does this look like a guy who 's in control ? Goodness gracious . No , that 's impossible . That can 't be me . Oh , it 's you , Terry . - What is this ? - You remember that car , don 't you ? You think you walked away from that without a scratch . Is that what you think ? This is a trick . Is it ? Uncle Brad ? You need to tell me where to find those women , Terry . They 're the reason you 're in that bed , they 're the reason your Uncle Brad looks so worried , and they 're your only hope of ever getting up again . - They did this to me . - You did this to yourself . It 's her . That one . It 's all her fault . What about her ? Terry ? She made me . I didn 't mean to . I didn 't want to . She meant for this to happen . Oh , you bitch . You bitch ! What did she make you do , Terry ? You just want to have a nice time . You want to have a nice day . But they won 't let you because they 're not nice . They are never nice . They care more about their dates and their boyfriends , and they don 't pay attention to Terry . They never let Terry play . No time for Terry . They are whores . No , she 's not a whore . You 're saying she uses sex to get what she wants . Yeah , I 'm saying she 's a lusty , bawdy , self-aware woman . She doesn 't allow men to define her . She knows she 's the one with the real power . What power ? Well , the same power that all women have . I mean , you make a nice day . You make shade . You put plastic umbrellas in the drinks . It doesn 't matter . It never matters . But I thought women back then had to do whatever a man said . Alison knows better . Alison knows it 's all up to her . She can have what she wants . She knows how to get it . " Myself have been the whippe . " She is the whip . She 's the one in control . They never do what Terry wants . They always do what they want . She made me . It 's not my fault . She made me . So if she were here and you were Chauncey ... Chaucer . And he 's the author . Doesn 't matter . She 'd know how to get the F on her chest turned into an A. You 're learning . Not literature , but still . But I can fix this . I can make this right . They 'll let me play again . We just need a new Aunt Sheila . We know he 's killed at least one . The unfortunate , ubiquitous Aunt Sheila ? I wasn 't expecting that . I didn 't think he 'd cross that line . But it makes sense . She probably fought back . That 's why he was wandering around with traces of that paralytic in his system . He lost a piece and was out looking to replace it when the accident happened . You gleaned quite a bit in there , all things considered . But not enough . By the way , smart move sending the uncle down there . Well , I knew what you had planned . I thought it might add a touch of pathos . He was really getting on your nerves , huh ? I couldn 't stand another moment . Yes ? - What happened ? - I don 't know . His uncle was visiting him . And then he went into cardiac arrest or something . - Where is Bradley ? - He was right here . False alarm . It was nothing . How was that cacophony nothing ? Somebody tampered with the main lead . Bradley , this is entirely unacceptable . We tried it your way , Addy . It didn 't work . Terry 's gonna have a little chat with his unc . Everything will be fine . Now , Terry , I ... He 's refusing to pick up . Well , I would say this is a very positive turn of events . - You think ? - I do , assuming your profile is correct . You still believe Terry Karrens will return to his victims ? I think he 's in the market for a new Aunt Sheila , but yeah . All our Actives are tagged with a GPS strip . We can find them anywhere at any time . So if there are survivors , Victor will lead us to them . What do you mean he wasn 't tagged ? Why not ? They took his GPS strip out before they started all that complicated facial reconstruction , - the scar removal . - But the surgery 's complete . Right . But Dr. Saunders is the one who signed off on having it taken out , and she kind of left before telling anybody to put it back . Lovely . So you 're saying that we 've imprinted an Active as a serial killer and then blindly let him loose upon the streets ? I wasn 't saying that . Victor might not have a working GPS in his body but maybe Bradley Karrens has one in his car . Oh . Funny how my mind would never think to go there . - What 's happening ? - That stuff , it 's wearing off . - Where is he ? - I don 't know . He killed her . He killed her . - I know . - And he 's gonna kill us , too . No , he isn 't . We won 't let him . What 's your name ? - Megan . - Megan . I 'm Robin . We have names . Remember that . We 're human , not his toys . We 're getting out of here . Find a weakness . - He 's on foot . - Damn . Or maybe not on foot . - What do you see ? - Metrolink station . If he got on it , he could be anywhere from the Valley , downtown , Hollywood . The accident , the hit and run , where did it happen ? Just outside Beverly Hills . That has to be close to where he 's keeping the women . You think he 's headed back there ? Probably with a stop along the way to pick up a new Aunt Sheila . The Hollywood line would put him straight towards Beverly Hills . Yeah . I 'm gonna see if I can pick up his trail . Your one-man manhunt 's using public transportation now ? Which is why you are going to provide assurance . Beg pardon ? Well , we cannot allow Victor to be used as Terry Karrens ' vehicle for abduction and murder . - I 'm personally against it . - You need to free Victor of him . - Love to . He 's not here . - I do know this . A remote wipe ? - It can 't be done . - It can be done . - Alpha did it with Echo . - But he used a tonal interface . Serial Killer Victor would need to have a phone . I 'd need to have a tone . I 'd have to get him to answer the phone . - Do you have his number ? - Obviously not . - Well ... - Think of another way . Think of it fast . " Upon an ambler easily she sat , " Well wimpled , aye , and over all a hat " As broad as is a buckler or a targe ... " A targe is a shield . Yeah , still not following . " A rug was tucked around her buttocks large " I guess a fat ass was a good thing in the 1300s . " And on her feet , a pair of spurs quite sharp . " Oh , nasty . " The remedies of love she knew , perchance , " For of that art she 'd learned the old , old dance . " I 'm liking that . Where 's your tune-age ? Don 't you just feel like dancing ? Yes . Are you feeling my Bathy girl power ? 'Cause I 'm pretty sure I 'm feeling your boy power . Now let 's talk about this F. It must be love or something . - This is Boyd . - Hey , Boyd , it 's Topher . We 're trying something here , and so we 're calling all the Handlers in the field to let them know that I 'm gonna be taking the biolink grid offline for a few seconds . So when your screen goes dead , there 's nothing to worry about . Okay . What are you trying ? - A remote wipe . - Why ? Well , Victor 's loose , doesn 't have GPS , and apparently he 's a serial killer . Ah . So what I 'm going to attempt to do is go into his biolink feed , which doesn 't tell me where he is but it does give me a way into his head . I 'm gonna reverse the signal , send a purgation tone and blow his mind . - Literally . - Thank you . And what , just leave him out there in his doll state , totally wiped ? He 'll be an empty-headed robot wandering around Hollywood . He 'll be fine . We 'll find him . - How will we know if we 're successful ? - Okay , look . See this ? Right now , his vitals are doing the mamba . He 's excited about something . If the wipe takes , they should flatten out . Go . Huh . You do have power over me . You are an incredible woman . What did you call me ? I am an incredible woman . Goodness gracious . Hello , Mr. Langton , how 's your evening out ? A lot like my evenings in . I 'm afraid there 's been a little bit of a situation here . Yeah . I spoke to Topher . - Did the remote wipe take ? - It remains to be seen . The attempt seems to have thrown the entire system offline . We 'll know all once Topher has rebuilt it . Until then , we 're blind . We need to bring in all our field Actives . Get them in pocket till the situation is resolved . - I agree . - You 'll take point on this ? I will do . I 'll start sending out the word , then grab Echo and come home . Very good . I thought I would make a nice day . But they just won 't let me . You know what ? Now they don 't even get a new Aunt Sheila . Yeah . Full recall . Everybody 's coming home . Hang on , that 's my other line . This is Boyd . Cooper , did you end the engagement ? What ? Cooper ? Get back to the house . It 's fine . Everything is gonna be fine . Yeah . This is Boyd . I need an ambulance . So how did it happen ? Do we even know what happened ? My best guess , I had to access the biolink grid for the remote wipe . I thought I isolated Victor , but everything must 've gotten scrambled . So we assume Terry Karrens ' imprint somehow got transferred to Echo . Either that or my attempt to make her hot for teacher really didn 't come off . If Terry 's in Echo , where did Kiki go ? I can see you stalking like a predator I 've been here before Temptation calls like Adam to the apple but I will not be caught Hey , save a little , buddy . 'Cause I can read those velvet eyes And all I see is lies No more poison ... You like dancing ? I 'm Kiki . I don 't know how I got here . I sort of don 't care . Am I drunk ? Have you seen this guy ? Spin me faster Like a kaleidoscope ... Hello ? Hello ? Hang on just a minute . Music is the cure So you can try to paralyze ... Hey , I noticed you watching me . I think we both know why . " As help me God , I laugh when I think how piteously a-nyght I made them swynke . " Do you know what that means ? I have no idea but it 's wicked filthy . How about buying a girl a drink before you swynke ? - Okay . - You think he might be what ? You suck . Trying to hit a girl . Oh , Paul . Paul . Thank God . Why did you ever leave me ? You got a problem ? - I got it . I got it . - You got it ? Oh , God . Go , go , go . Okay , let 's go . Let 's go . Oh , thank God . We thought that you were him . I am him . Hello , ladies . Ready to finish our game ? - She 's really hurt . - She 's really hurt ? How do you think I feel ? You tried to kill me with a car . - What ? - What ? Don 't play stupid . You think I don 't know what 's going on here ? What you 've been up to ? We need to get her to a hospital . Oh , please , Mother . Always protecting your little princess . I am not your mother . Well , then , I guess I 'm not your son . You always said , " Be a man . " You do make it a little difficult . You think ... You think you can make me dirty like you . I am not ... They are whores . - You did this to me . - Please . We just want to leave . I 'll just bet you do . Everybody always wants to leave Terry . How about you , Aunt Sheila ? Huh ? You still feel like leaving ? Aunt Sheila ? Aunt Sheila doesn 't want to leave . I say we all take a tip from her . You 're staying . No . No ! Did I fall asleep ? No , no , no , no , no . Don 't engage until we know the worm is dead . You have to kill it in the G-line . - The wave is hiding . - Well , why is it moving ? Because it 's designed to go where it 's not supposed to . It 's the whole point . - What about now ? - System 's still down ? Evidently . I see you 've made a friend . I 'm Kiki . Wait , wait , okay . - Okay , I think we 're good . - Yes . - Yeah . - All right . Where is she ? Beverly Hills . I think she 's gone shopping . Maybe they 're both Kiki . He was here . He 's still here . He wants to kill you . You have to kill him first . He 's coming back . He 's coming back . Get away from the door . - He won 't let me . - What are you talking about ? - Get away from the door . - You have to kill him . - What do you mean ? - We have to kill her . Yes . No problem . No . No . Yes . He 'll find you . He won 't stop . He 'll never stop . He can 't . What you 're saying doesn 't make sense . It doesn 't have to make sense . It just is . He took you from a shopping mall . He followed you from your house . He 'd been watching you for days . Your little house , the yellow house . He watched you from the street . He sat in his car , and he watched you . He could see your kitchen from the street . He saw the boy , the red-headed boy . He liked the way the boy looked at you . That 's why he took you . He 'll do it again . You need to stop him for that little boy . You won 't get another chance . Echo , are you okay ? I don 't think so . Would you like a treatment ? I rather like him this way . You know , you asked me to get into his head . I never really could . His uncle 's having him transported back to the hospital this afternoon . You think he 'll ever wake up ? Wouldn 't it be nice if he didn 't ? - Good day . - Good day . I think he dreams . Not anymore . Goodness gracious . English - US - SDH Ripped by stlc8tr

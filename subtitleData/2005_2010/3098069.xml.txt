 You need new pillows . My pillows rule , and you know it . You know , we could stay at your place tonight . Maybe . We 'll see how the day goes . Sigalert on the northbound 405 at the 10 due to an overturned semi . It spilled over a hundred cases of diapers all across the lanes of traffic . - Somebody 's tense . - Sure . Keep going . I 'll get over it . You 've been working too hard . This coming from a girl who works four double shifts in five days ? Hey , life of nurse . Life of a cop . Hey ... let 's just take a drive up the coast ... Blow off the world for a day . I got a meeting with internal affairs at 3 : 00 . - This is about Andrea ? - Yeah . How serious is it ? Serious enough . I 'd hate to lose another partner just 'cause ... somebody 's got a personal ax to grind . You think Chad has something to do with it ? Ah , no . Listen ... your business is your business , and me bringing up my ex-husband in the shower just ... that wasn 't right , so ... I 'll never do it again . I didn 't mean to break your ... your palm tree thing . My mom gave it to me . I 'm sorry . Where can I- - where can I get you a new one ? This cute little place in Palm Springs . I think it 's called a gas station . Listen ... I know things haven 't been exactly - No , everything 's ... all good , all right ? I 'll call you at the hospital ? - All right . - Be safe . Give Rambis a hug for me . Okay . I 've got a dozen e-mails to return , a conference call that starts , like , now . And the note says ... What ? You want me in Burbank by 8 : 00 ? That 's in 20 minutes . I 'm in Venice . Oh , gosh . Crap . Oh , it 's okay , ma 'am . I 'm a cop . Thank you , officer . Excuse me , ma 'am . - yeah , there 's a traffic jam on the 405 . - Miss . - I don 't know some diapers or some ... - Excuse me , miss . You dropped this . - Somebody call 9-1-1 . - Oh , my God ! Are you okay ? My car ! My car ! Mr. Harper , your dog bark very hard last night . Oh , sorry about that , Mr. Zeitoun . You have a leak from upstairs . My wife say plumbers come . - Now we have leak . - Okay . - Thank you . - You have leak . We have leak . Rambis ? Rambis . Rambis . Psycho dog , did you make this mess ? All right , all right , I get it . Give me this . You have nine messages . Message one . Message two . Hello . Sis , I got six hang ups from you last night . What 's goin 'on ? Nothing . We just ... we just had a little , problem with the phone . But it 's okay now . You sure ? You sound kinda rattled ? Oh , no , no , no , no , no . it 's ... we 're just late for school . So we 'll talk later , okay ? Bye . Message seven . Damn it , where you at ? It 's me , Damien . Turn on your cell phone . They hit the safe house , Hop . You need to come get my ass . Police ! Hands up ! Easy ! Easy ! I 'm a cop . I 'm a cop ! Okay , all right . Okay , I 'm relaxed . - I 'm relaxed . I 'm relaxed . - Detective brett hopper ? Yeah . Get these guys off of me . Can 't . You 're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto garza . - What ? - " You have the right to remain silent . " If you give up the right to remain silent , anything you say can - Have a seat . - Before y 'all apologize for breaking down my door , I want to see the warrant . 'Cause you had to have more than some lame-ass anonymous tip to get a judge to sign off on that kind of a blitz . Well , they told us you 'd puff up . I 'm Detective Choi . - Detective Spivak . - I 've had the pleasure . Look , you know what we do in here , all the tactics , the back and forth , so I 'm coming straight at you . What did you have against Garza ? You gotta be kidding , right ? We 've got the murder weapon with your prints on it . All right , well , a gun 's easy enough to plant . Prints are doable , too , a little tougher . Where 'd you get it ? Where do you think we got it ? I don 't know , but chances are , whoever gave you the gun is in on it . Now tell me where you got it . Your place . Your closet . The closet ? Pretty stupid move , man . Why would you hang on to something like that ? Somebody broke into my place and put that gun there . Now the neighbor said something about a plumber , - and my dog was going crazy , so - - Why 'd you do it , Hopper ? Was it personal , or did Garza have something on you ? All right , you guys aren 't ... According to the newspapers , Garza was hit sometime last night , right ? Well , I was with somebody last night . Rita Shelton . She 's a nurse at Westside . So I got an alibi . Secondly , I 've never even met Garza , so ... - you got no motive . - How about murder-for-hire ? I want my lawyer and a phone . After you 're booked , like everyone else . Look into the camera , please . Thank you very much . You can step away . Andrea ... Hang on . That 's my partner . - Hopper , what 's goin 'on ? - I don 't know . Your guess is as good as mine . I 've got to get to my brother ! They put me on leave . So before you go telling certain people things - you think - - Andrea , hello ? Fingerprints , mug shot . I 'm a little busy right now . Let 's go , detective . You are a lucky man , Hopper . I got you one of the best criminal defense attorneys in the state . Barry Colburn . He 'll meet you at the courts 'building for arraignment . Come on , Baxter . You gotta do better than that . Now flex some federal muscle and get me outta here . I 'm doing the best I can . Been on the phone all morning . Nobody 's giving an inch not the D.A. ' S office , not L.A.P.D. I 'm a cop with a clean record and an alibi . - How is this happening ? - Hey , I know you 're pissed . But this hurts me , too . Damien is on the run , and you 're the only one he trusts . This case hinges on his testimony . Well , I 'm sorry for being so insensitive . Seriously , Hopper . How am I supposed to find my star witness without you ? Did you see Damien last night ? Did you talk to him ? Give me something . All right , he left a message on my machine . He wants me to come get him . Where is he ? What happened at the safe house ? Focus , Baxter . I 'm the one in jail . Now I can 't help you or Damien unless you get me outta here . - Let 's go . - Why did you kill Garza ? Why did you kill Garza , detective Hopper ? Detective Hopper , this way ! Was it murder-for-hire ? Baxter tried to put in a good word for you with the L.A. County D.A. , - But Garza was one of theirs . - All right , Colburn - - Barry . - Where 's Rita ? We can 't find her . What do you mean , you can 't find her . did you check the hospital ? She 's not at the hospital , she 's not in her apartment , she 's not answering her cell . The cops are looking for her , - and I 've got my people out in the street . - Colburn , your first and last priority as of right now Rita Shelton . Do you understand me ? Okay . Oh , by the way , pulled in a couple of favors and got you some time with your sister . Jen , where is she ? I 'll see you in there , Hopper . Oh , my god . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm gonna be fine . I 'm fine . - They said they found a gun . - No . Well , they did . - Someone else put it there . - Who would put - I don 't know . It doesn 't matter because I have an alibi . Rita Shelton . Wait , you and Rita , as in Chad 's wife ? Well , ex-wife , but ... and you didn 't tell me . Well , Jen , we haven 't been talking as much as we- - never mind about that . I wanna know about those six hang ups from last night . And don 't give me that mess about the phones . - I told you it was nothing . - Is everything ok between you and Randall ? - Of course . - Jen , I ... - I 'm gonna kill him . - Who you killin 'now ? Chad . Jennifer . You 're lookin 'well . Come on , partner . Time to face the music . Boy , you know , cops will pull a lot of crazy stunts to weasel out of a meeting with internal affairs . But committing a murder , that definitely wins a prize , huh , Hopper ? You have an ugly smile . People say that about you , especially women . We 'll meet you up on four , guys . I need a little quality time with my old partner here . I said we 'll you up on four . Come on . You get the score of the dodger game ? I know Andrea is a dirty cop . You 're gonna help me prove it . Yeah , I got a few other things on my mind right now besides what my partner may or may not be into . Yeah , this whole " murdering the assistant D.A. " thing . - it 's a real shame , isn 't it ? - You know this thing screams setup from - from , like a mile away . - Setup ? No , they got you cold , man . Weapon , prints ... but you got an alibi , right ? Rita ? Been spending a lot of time with her lately . When you gonna make an honest woman of her , get married already ? Tell the truth . It bugs you she kept my last name , doesn 't it ? You need a breath mint . Here 's what I don 't understand . You don 't want to break some unspoken code by turning in your partner , yet you got no problem sleeping with - another man 's wife ? - You were divorced , and we weren 't partners anymore . You expect me to believe those years we rolled together , - you never - - It never happened , Chad . Never . How is she these days , my little Rita ? It 's been a while , but there 's certain things you just never forget . You know , like in the shower . you better watch it , convict . You play this right , I can help you . But you screw with me ... Shelton . Why do I get the feeling you know more than you 're telling ? Because I do . And due to the severity of the crime and the physical evidence against the suspect , the county requests no bail . - We ask - - Your honor , the District Attorney 's office has been made aware of an exculpatory witness - who can attest my client 's whereabouts - - a witness that we can 't locate at this time your honor . We consider the suspect to be a danger - and a flight risk , and we ask - - flight risk ? He 's a decorated 12-year veteran of the department . Veteran or not , the people are pursuing a charge of first-degree murder . Very well . People 's request is granted . Suspect will be held without bail and remanded to county jail . Preliminary hearing is set for a week from today , whether or not this witness has been produced . Dismissed . Find Rita . ... these series in the books . A single here , a double there , and the Dodgers pull off an amazing 7-run rally in the 9th to beat the Giants 11-10 . Folks , it just doesn 't get any better than this . What is this ? Where am I ? Chad , is that you ? Is this how internal affairs is running things now ? Now that 's enough questions , detective Hopper . You 're going to admit to killing Alberto Garza . What ? Garza , the assistant D.A. You 're going to confess . I 'm not gonna do a damn thing . Who the hell are you people ? you know , you really need to get over this tough guy persona . It 's not going to help you here . Show him . You know firsthand how dangerous this city can be . Anything can happen to anyone . - Rita . - Random acts of assault and battery , r ape ... carjacking . I 'm gonna kill you ! I 'm gonna kill you ! - I will kill you ! - Calm down . There 's more . No . Don 't worry . Your sister and the kids are okay . I swear to God , I will find you . Well , whatever you do is your choice , detective , but just remember , for every decision ... - I 'm gonna kill you . - There 's a consequence . Relax . Just a mild sedative . We 'd like you to ... unwind . Sleep on it . Remember ... decision ... consequence . Decision ... consequence . decision ... consequence . What was that for ? I had the worst nightmare . It was so real . Are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah . I just ... I feel a little sore . Brett , what 's wrong ? You ever have a déjà vu ? Yeah . Gives me the creeps when that happens . ... on the freeways today . Starting out , out here on the westside , we 've got a sigalert on the northbound 405 at the 10 due to an overturned semi . - It spilled over a hundred cases of ... - diapers . All across the lanes of traffic ... . Brett ? Baby , you don 't ... you don 't look so good . I need a shower . Slow down . - What happened ? - Oh , my side . Did I shave last night ? What ? No . Why ? What happened ? I gotta go walk Rambis . You gotta be kidding me . You have nine messages . - Message seven . - Damn it , where you at ? - It 's me , Damien . - Turn on your cell phone ! Yes , Rita Shelton . When she gets in , tell her not to go any - Jen , stay at home with the kids today . Don 't go to school . - Call me at the second where you got it . - Your place ! I need a patrol car right outside her apartment . In your closet . - It 's pretty stupid move , man . - ... the murder weapon with your prints on it . Why would you hang on to something like that ? My name ? Detective Spivak . he just dropped it in the water . Rita Shelton . Where is she ? - I 'm sorry , sir , you need to wait . - I 'm detective Hopper . I called earlier . - I need to see her now . - She 's not here now . What do you mean she 's not here ? Her shift started at 8 : 00 . She called in and said she was taking a vacation day . A vacation day ? She never said anything to me about - Out of the way . Massive trauma to her head , internal bleeding , multiple fractures . - What happened ? - Bus crash . Driver had a stroke , went out of control . Miss ... you dropped this . - Crash cart ready . - Move her into bay three . I didn 't go for coffee . This is not a request . You will sit in my office until you learn to ... Brett ? What are you doing here ? Randall . I 'm gonna kill him . You 're dismissed . Don 't you ever touch my sister again . From the assignment last night , who can tell me what country Jules Verne was referring to ? Brett , what are you doing here ? - Security to first floor west . - I can 't find Rita . She 's missing , so they 're probably watching you . Rita ? Rita who ? Never mind . You 're in danger . I need you to get the kids , get in a car and just drive . Don 't tell me where you 're going . - Don 't tell Randall . But it 's gotta be now . - What is wrong with you ? - You 're acting really crazy . - There isn 't any time ! - What is this about , brett ? - Just do what I say and go far away from here . What did you do ? - Just go . Go . - Go get the kids . What if I pull the wrong block ? Then we start the game over , all right ? Hopper ? Andrea . Thanks for coming . Didn 't think you 'd call , considering the circumstances . Well , believe me , I didn 't have anyone else to turn . Good to know you think so highly of me . I didn 't mean it like that . Listen , I need you to do me a favor in case I get caught again . Again ? What do you mean ? Never mind . I need your help . I can 't find Rita , and I think that she may be in danger . Now look , I know that you got your own troubles to deal with right now , - butI didn 't say anything to I.A. about what - - let 's just stick to your problem , okay ? Tell me what happened with Garza . Garza ? Why would you ask me ... I 'm sorry . Move ! Get out of my way ! Get out of my way ! Move ! Move ! Move ! I got him . We got him . Suspect 's on the Westbound train . Cover all exits . Doors closing . Doors closing . Doors closing . Great minds , huh ? Might as well tattoo the word " guilty " right across your forehead . I know I 'm clean . Y 'all ain 't got nothing . How about the murder weapon ? I don 't know what you talking about . Really ? So you 're saying the dive teams won 't find anything off the Santa Monica pier ? ... in the water . oh , I think we hit a nerve . Who 's feeding you this crap ? - Who 's your source ? - You 're not asking the questions , Hopper . We are . Now why did you kill Garza ? You wanted the phone . - Message seven . - Damn it , where you at ? It 's me , Damien . Turn on your cell phone ! They hit the safe house , Hop . You need to come get my ass ! Look , I 'll be layin 'low where you first got it all started , you know what I 'm saying ? Meet me there at 9 : 00 tomorrow night . Ah , that 's tonight . - Message eight . - All right , time 's up . Hopper , you should have received a package today . - Let 's go . - It 's important . Don 't let anyone - Bad engouh you 're in here for murder . You had to kick the crap out of your brother-in-law , too ? It felt necessary and good . Well , that 's great . Anyway , I spoke to your sister . And ... she 's trying to get him to drop the charges , - but he 's pretty pissed off . - Wait , she 's still with him ? Yeah , at the hospital . They 're still picking the glass out of his back . Okay , listen , Colburn ... Barry , I need you to do me a favor and get my sister and her kids someplace safe . - Why ? - Please don 't ask me questions . Just do it . - What about you ? - Don 't worry about me . - I 'll get out of here soon enough . - Yeah , that 's what they all say . Stinkin 'dodgers , down six runs going into the ninth . I had to turn it off . Meet you up on four , guys . I need a little quality time with my old partner here . Don 't worry , fellas . I 'll be gentle . You want to know a secret , Chad ? The dodgers rally in the ninth . They win . Where is Rita ? You are itching for a toe tag , aren 't ya ? Who is behind this , huh ? ! - Who 's watching ? Where 's Rita ? - You are certifiable . I 'll make sure you end up on death row . You believe in second chances , Andrea ? You cut a deal with I.A. to bring me in , yes or no ? I 'm not proud of it , okay . But I.A. Is convinced I 'm taking a payoff from - - Are you ? - No ! You shouldn 't keep that thing under your mattress . I found it in 30 seconds . What are you doing in my home , Hopper ? I need to know if I can trust you ... if we 're still partners . Partners ? You 've been giving your partner the cold shoulder the last six months . Now you 're wanted for murder , and you 're telling me Rita 's missing . - What the hell is going on with you ? - I don 't know . I 'm ... I 'm just trying to get control of this day . This day is over . You gotta worry about tomorrow . This ... mess you 're in ... have anything to do with the fact you 've been looking into the latin disciples ? - Where did you hear that ? - Don 't worry . I haven 't told anyone . I 'm working this case for the U.S. Attorney 's office . It 's strictly confidential . We flipped this kid , Damien Ortiz , against the disciples . - Trial 's tomorrow . Now he 's on the run . - If they 're after this kid , - they 're gonna get to him . - Hopefully not before I do . Think the disciples have something to do - with Rita going missing ? - That 's what I 'm gonna find out . I need you to search her place for me , check for signs of a struggle , - run a trace on - - cell pho , yeah . Done this before . Does that mean you 're gonna help me ? You 're gonna need this . Thanks . Where you headed ? I 'm going clubbing . Hey . I 'm Damien 's 9 : 00 . Come on through . Arms out to your side . Turn around . What do you got here ? Nice . Easy ! Oh , no . Listen , wait , wait , wait . You don 't wanna do this , okay ? Get Damien , and we can discuss this like men . Stop , stop ! you think that first step 's a bitch ? Wait till the next one . Turned me against my own only so you could sell my ass out ? I didn 't sell you out . - Tell me what happened . - You know what happened . Your safe house was a death trap . Why would I be here helping you while I 'm on the run for murder ? - Murder ? - Yeah . - Hey , yo , who you playin ' ? - Hey , hey , don 't you watch the news ? I 'm wanted for killing an assistant D.A. You gotta tell me exactly what happened , D. , All right ? 'Cause only a handful of people knew where we were hiding you . Yeah , well , somebody said something , eh ? 'Cause them feds that 's supposed to be looking out for me , protecting my ass , are long gone . I wake up , don 't hear nobody in the house . Check the window ? All the cars are gone . See some skinheaded fools coming my way ... - strapped . - Wait , skinheads ? - Not disciples ? - Nah , some good ol 'hog-ridin 'boys . Look , I ain 't no fool , Hop . I figure the L. D. ' s farmed it out , make it look like some other crew . All right , did any of these disciples say anything about Garza - or me ? - You ? Nah , this is bigger than you or some D.A. , Man . - I need names , Damien . - You 're crazy . Our deal 's off , Hop . You on your own . Just give me one name , D. Forget about feds , forget about Baxter , all right ? I will personally find you protection myself . - Nah , man . I don 't think so . - You 're making a mistake . Just give me a - you people know you just blew away a federal witness ? Or is that part of the plan ? Forget the kid . We have business to discuss , detective Hopper . Yeah , yeah , I know . I know what you 're capable of . I know you can get at Rita and my sister and her kids . But if you want me to take the fall for Garza , you better not touch them . You understand me ? How did you know this was about Garza ? You 're the one behind the curtain . You tell me . I need to know how you came to this information . What are you talking about ? You told me last time I was here . You think this is a game ? Oh , no . Okay , listen , listen , I 'll do whatever you tell me . Just don 't hurt them ! A little late for that . No ! No ! - For every decision ... - No . There 's a consequence . Why ? ! Tell me why this is happening ! Relax . Just a mild sedative . We 'd like you to ... unwind ... Sleep on it . But remember , decision ... consequence . decision ... consequence . decision ... consequence .

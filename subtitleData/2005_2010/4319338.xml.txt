 JACK : Previously on Kings ... SILAS : You 've been transferred to Shiloh . You saved my Iife . We can skip all that . Besides , you 're the darling today . You allowed an assault on your own soldiers . You are not my King . He 's harmless . He 's a cocker spaniel . That cocker spaniel just got the best post in the military . SILAS : I wonder how he 'd react if he knew about you . Have you forgotten your vow ? What you do at night with your boys is a disgrace . We give up what we want when we want power . I woke you . I was up . Why do I ever leave ? I 'm happy when I 'm here . Daddy 's here . ROSE : Finally . How many tickets left in the lottery ? UNN REPORTER : Only two seats remaining . By order of the Queen , the first three rows for the First Night of the Royal Ballet and Gala tonight have been held for any citizen wanting to attend . And clearly , there are a Iot of them . Any official response to Reverend Samuels' condemnation of the King ? Polls show us divided on Port Prosperity . Not tonight , we aren 't . No division , nor anything else can disrupt First Night . Strict orders from the Queen . ( REPORTERS LAUGHING ) REPORTER 1 : Do you have a ticket ? J 86 . Next . MINISTER OF WATER : Pella Dam is underway to compensate for the reservoirs lost with Port Prosperity . Drilling slowed by protest . Part of the campaign against the turnover of Port Prosperity . " Our blood , our land . " Good slogan . Let me guess . Reverend Samuels . He 's spoken out against the Port for Peace plan in his sermon . Calling for ... The court is no Ionger interested in the opinions of the good reverend . Perry ? Deleted from the record , sir . HANSON : Next petitioner . Court calls Miss Michelle Benjamin , petition on healthcare improvement , revised . Revised ? We 've seen this movie before , Miss Benjamin . Will it be more woeful pictures with no viable plan ? Numbers , sir . Cold , hard numbers . Independent auditing indicating national savings , should we incorporate early stage preventatives , and avoidable losses if we don 't . Esteemed King is welcome to ignore the boons considered action owe him , only he does so now at the expense of fact , profit , and public record . Miss , you 've been learning to speak fancy . ( PEOPLE CHUCKLE ) I have a fair teacher . ( CHUCKLES ) Your sister certainly makes her presence known . I 'II grant her that . She 's starting to sound like him . Yes . You said he 'd be ready at 4 : 00 . I 'II employ my military escort if I have to . And I don 't want any surprises tonight . There 's just been one . A seating change . Undersecretary Acharon has requested to be seated next to Captain Shepherd . ( SIGHS ) along with a generous donation . What kind of donation ? 1 00,000 . He , quote , " Wants to see what he 'II do next . " We ask for 10,000 for a seat by the King . ( LAUGHS ) Well ... I see Silas commands his thousands , while David brings his hundred thousands . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) His star seems to be shining bright . Yes . Well , someone should see to that , and maybe consider tending his own . 4 : 00 . Well , then deserve such a healthcare plan , and I would hope that the government would ... Apologies to the petitioner . But the King is through with politics for the day . I waited a Iong time for peace to prevail so the arts might have their day in Shiloh . Pass law , wage war tomorrow , if you Iike . Tonight he 's mine . You 're starting to find your rhythm , sir . I was just a Iittle worried I wouldn 't get out of there in time . I never thought I 'd be this excited about a ballet . About that . Unfortunately , we 're one ticket short . Last minute need . One of the Queen 's biggest fundraisers . We had to give away your seat . The Queen appreciates it . It 's not something I did . Is it ? There will be other invitations . A hundred grand . Not bad . I got to close session in the boardroom , but that didn 't cost anyone a dime . I 'm sorry , sir ? First Night . It should be fun . Oh , I 'm not going . They needed my ticket , so ... Let me guess . Thomasina . Maybe a story about a last minute seat for a donor . ( LAUGHS ) You 've been uninvited . My mother must have seen some advantage in not having you there and she pursued it . You didn 't honestly want to go , did you ? I was hoping to see Michelle there . She 's the Princess . If she wanted you there , you 'd be there . Don 't get me wrong . She 's my sister , but you can 't mind her moods . No one has that much free time . Don 't blame yourself . This is the greatest city in the world . Provided you don 't wait on my family to show it to you . Believe me . My father throws me a bone in court and thinks I 'II forget a life of looking at me like a disappointment . ( SIGHS ) You know what ? I 'II do you one better . Yeah . My ticket 's going to have to go to charity tonight . I 'm taking you out . ( LAUGHING ) You don 't ... You don 't need to do that . I think I do . I think you need a friend . I think you need a few friends . ( CELL PHONE DIALING ) I think it 's lucky I ran into you . Ho ! Yeah ! I believe you know these gentlemen . ( LAUGHS ) You flew my friends in from the front ? ( MEN LAUGHING ) ( MATTHEWS EXCLAIMS ) SAVOY : What 's up ? MATTHEWS : What are you doing ? ( CAMERAS SNAPPING ) First Night . I can 't believe we 're really there . Technically , we 're not there . We 're outside . I think I saw a ballerina . I don 't see Jack . He just called to say he won 't be coming . Something about attending to his star . Hmm . Sometimes , your mother has a point . ( AUDIENCE CLAPPING ) Thank you . I remember my first ballet . Every ruffle . Every note . I thought I was watching angels and asked where their wings went . ( AUDIENCE LAUGHING ) I had a dream I hope is not too silly . To take what captured my imagination so absolutely once and bring it to you . When we have art , we have inspiration . ( AUDIENCE AGREEING ) This is the true gift of my husband to whom this night and my thanks is due . ( AUDIENCE CLAPPING ) MAN : Hear , hear ! You inspire all of us , sir . And so , tonight , for the first time in our lifetimes , let angels dance in Shiloh . ( AUDIENCE LAUGHS ) ( AUDIENCE CLAPPING ) ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) ( MEN CHEERING ) ( RONNY EXCLAIMS ) Listen up , soldiers . You 've been recruited for a special assignment . To show Shepherd a good time . Yeah . There are rules . Rules ? Yes . Rule number one . Stay within earshot . Someone messes with you , they handle it . Yeah ? Guys like fights because guys like lawsuits . always party protected . Speaking of rule number two . Take these . Mmm-hmm . Mmm-hmm . ( MEN LAUGHING ) RONNY : When the time comes , and it will , use your own . Unless you Iike being called Daddy , stay away from pins , needles and the sharp nails of gold diggers . Ronny makes good things happen . Often in little skirts and in little baggies . MATTHEWS : What ? Whoa ! The man 's got taste . AII in good time . You are partying with royalty tonight . ( LAUGHS ) So , things are different . Physics don 't apply . Velvet ropes unhook like bra straps . And everything comes free . We don 't pay for food . We don 't pay for drinks . We don 't approach girls . ( LAUGHS ) AII things come to us . And only the best . The fattiest tuna . ( RONNY MOANING ) ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) I thought we saved a place for Shepherd . A ballet would have bored an uncouth soldier . I was an uncouth soldier once . Sorry , sir . You have a call . I don 't . It 's the countryside , sir . There 's an emergency . ( SIGHS ) Send the usual team . Whatever they need . ( MEN LAUGHING ) Where are we ? Relax . Trust in God . BRUNO : Your Highness . Who are your friends ? JACK : Bruno , they 're all with me . Very important people . I 've got my brother , my cousin , my reflexologist , tennis instructor ... ( REPORTERS CLAMORING ) Oh ! I can 't forget about my shrinks . ( TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Is that ... JACK : It 's her party . Who wants to meet her ? Meet her ? I 'd nail her pregnant . Sit . Say little . Hey . Hey ! Meet Private Matthews . He 's on furlough from the front , and no one has offered him a drink in whole minutes . We can 't have that , now , can we ? Private . Gentlemen . That 's got to be fun . What ? Being you . My dad has his boardroom . I have this . It 's a mystery . My parents did whatever they did long ago , and then had sex and had me . And now , people care what I wear and where I go . Is it always like this ? ( LAUGHS ) Oh , it only gets better . If you 're even interested . I 'm not a saint . No . I 'm guessing you just lacked for opportunity . The thing about royalty is , there 's no end to what people will do to get close to you . Like it will rub off and suddenly make them less obscure . Something in the way my mom set up the monarchy . They think we 're something other than human . So , they give you things . Whatever they have . The waters part and dignity crumbles . I have a room in my apartment just for that . It 's all there . Things you can do or have or have done to you . I can 't even begin to tell you how deep it goes . And I 've dug . But I can promise you , if you start digging , you won 't be thinking about my sister after . ( LAUGHING ) ( DAVID CLEARS THROAT ) ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) Sir . How is he ? He 's not well . I had to bring him in . We 've been here before . Not like this . He 's bad , Silas . He 's struggling . Specialists are on their way . Whatever he needs . HELEN : He needs his father . And he 's been asking for you and he is in pain and I just don 't know how to tell him no . I don 't know if I can . A thousand times you 've told me , you 'd do anything for me . I never asked for a thing . I am asking now . ( AUDIENCE APPLAUDING ) ( AUDIENCE CHEERING ) I 'II be there . There he is . You missed the finale . That 's enough of that . Come . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) You made people care about ballet as much as you do . Really , it was an achievement . Oh ! I 'm only trying to share my passions . I thought David Shepherd was coming . AII right . If you must know , security detail said he went out with Jack . Apparently , they thought a twitty girl 's party was a better offer . I 'm sorry . But if you are looking for a dance partner , there are plenty here . Not all heroes , but ... Oh , Iet me guess . Paul Lash . You used to play with him very nicely back in the day . He manages a healthy fund now . He 's one of the city 's top financiers . We played when he was three , and he used to eat my crayons . Enough . You can 't be mad at the world just because you didn 't get your way at court . It 's your fault . What ? That he didn 't grant my petition ? Well , you honestly can 't expect your father to give you everything . You know what ? You make a strong point . ( SAMUELS LAUGHING ) That laughter at my expense ? Merely appreciating the evening . But I can 't say I support what you have done . Offering away our lands ? You don 't support peace ? After all your words , you 'd rather war ? I 'd rather an undivided nation , as planned , as promised . Those plans , those promises weren 't vouchsafed by treaty , by action . I did that . You come to my house , drink my Scotch , criticize me ? I thought we agreed to no politics . This is beyond politics . The Reverend has recently made this personal . Ma 'am . You have brought art to Shiloh and music to hearts . You have raised the level . This is why we end wars . And perhaps it 's best I take my leave . Mmm . Can 't you manage pleasantries for one night ? Not this one . We 've had a collapse at Pella . The whole timetable for the peace treaty ... Absolutely not . I 'II bar the door if I have to . I 'II pitch a fit to make you wish for war . Whatever it is , you stay by my side and you handle it here . This one night , Silas . Hmm ? You promised . And by God , I 'm going to take it . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( LAUGHS ) How quickly they grow up . JOSEPH : I wasn 't sure you 'd be here . Last minute thing . Came with friends . You 've got to do your thing . Yeah . See you after . Not a good idea . Why ? No eyes on you tonight . Look , I know the drill . I 'II meet you later . I miss you . What is it ? Is this the guy you came with ? If I didn 't call you , there 's a reason . Take the hint . Time to go . Next stop . Round up the kids . ( SNAPPING FINGERS ) Hey . DAVID : Jack . Time to go , buddy . already ? I 'm sort of okay here . You can do better . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) I don 't drink often enough to know what I want , but I find myself suddenly in need . Pick me something . You 're talking to me . Is that strange ? I 've been to a Iot of events at altar Mansion and tried to talk to you at all of them . And ... How did you do ? ( MICHELLE LAUGHS ) Not well . Well , maybe today is a good day . But maybe today you want something . I never lived down being caught with a few munched crayons . I did grow up , Michelle . I read the papers and everything . And your petition crashed again . And if you 're as smart as your proposal , you figured you 'd do better if you came armed with outside funding . Well , are you willing to listen ? Not for free . So , what 's a sales pitch cost these days ? Um , a dance . Everyone gets to dance with you . I want to see something no one else does . Ma 'am . Ah , Perry . Did you enjoy yourself ? Or were you stifling a yawn the whole time ? Be honest . Honest ? When curtain came , daresay , I cried , ma 'am . You weren 't taking notes the whole time ? The King demanded my stylus left bedside . Well , that ... Excuse me . Wedgewood is moving . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Sorry to bother you , ma 'am . Just giving you the update on the King 's return . His return ? He left ? I 'm sorry . There was an accident at Pella . I initiated emergency protocol to Unity . Was I not supposed to ? No , Hanson , you weren 't . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ) Trouble comes . Trouble called . Mmm , claudia . I can always count on you . I was hoping one of yours would take care of one of mine . From the tank ? Hardly seems fair . He 's feeling a Iittle clean . ( LAUGHS ) You 're an awful human being . I miss our Wednesdays . Help me , and maybe we can reinstate . I know just the girl . You mean you ? I should warn you . He has a Iittle thing for my sister . Things change . Hello . What are you drinking ? ( CRYING ) I 'm so sorry . Don 't . Don 't . Shh ! ( HEART MONITOR BEEPING ) Hey , puppy . It 's me . I 'm here . THOMASINA : How 's he doing ? An entire floor of my hospital cleared , and two servicemen dragging me around it ? Are you going to tell me why ? You 're the most qualified specialist available . You treated him before . I want to know about his progress and your intention for him . May I ask your relation ? He came in a few hours ago . Counts bad and fever climbing . He 's fighting infection . And given the immuno-suppressants ... You 've run through the antibiotics ? He 's responded in the past to ... We tried them all . What 's been working , isn 't . We considered a course of glycopeptides ... And the risk to the kidneys ? His system is so strained . If he 's going to make it through the night , we 're hoping to find something he can handle . SILAS : Hoping ? You 'd best have a better course of action than hope . When was his last blood culture taken ? Uh , within the hour . Seth was doing so well after his last round . He can 't stay this way . What do we do ? Well , we held off on last resorts before , given the risks . Are you saying we 're there ? ( STAMMERING ) I ... It 's hard . Are we there ? I don 't see an option . Do you ... I 'm sorry . Do you know the family ? Prepare it . Your treatment . DOCTOR : Yes , sir . You 'II need a transfusion . I 'II order it from the bank . ( CLEARS THROAT ) No . You 'II use mine . You 're certain you 're a match ? I 'II get a nurse . SILAS : No , you won 't . So , you 're the one who brings him . Ma 'am . Thank you . Ma 'am . ( UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Didn 't think we 'd ever get you out on Jack 's scene . You 're all Michelle 's if the tabloids are to be believed . I made the mistake of believing them , too . Whatever happened , it wasn 't your fault . Trust me . I 'm an idiot for thinking I had a chance . I 've been friends with Michelle since before we knew what sex was . It 's just who she is . Ice doesn 't melt in her mouth . No one ever does . No one 's ever good enough for her . Even the ones who are . Come on . No . No , you don 't have to ... I mean ... Dance with me . ( DOOR CLOSING ) ( LAUGHING ) Yep . The King 's socks . And that one 's even got a hole in it . Just like us , only somehow better . AII right . So , I 've taken you behind the curtain . The man is down from the mountain . Well , a deal 's a deal . Send me your proposal . And if it 's sound , then my board can offer funds to match government contribution . And they love this sort of thing . That 's it ? It 's that easy ? Yeah . I Iook forward to talking the details with you . I guess we 'II be having a Iot of dinners together . Business partners and all . Okay . Thank you , Paul . I ... You may not realize this , but you just saved lives over socks . ( LAUGHS ) Yeah , I wouldn 't have guessed that our setup would have a humanitarian outcome , but it 's an auspicious start . ( STAMMERS ) I 'm sorry . What setup ? Oh . This . I thought ... Your mother ... She called me this afternoon to tell me that you wouldn 't have a date tonight and were open ... My mother called you . Yeah . Right before the ballet . ( SIGHS ) ( CAMERA CLICKING ) Be sure to send an extra copy to Mr. Walker 's parents . You knew all along that David wouldn 't be here tonight . You planned it to push me into Paul . If he took a night out with your brother , no one held a gun to his head . Or yours . He 's a good person . Probably the only person in this city without an agenda . He is not that virtuous . No one is . Are you so worried that I 'd Iike him ? No . I was confident that you would lose interest in him eventually . As always . Then why are you cutting him out ? Because he is taking up too much attention . Because the press writes about David ? Our whole lives are attention . We can spare some . This country only works if people look up to us . Not some boy . When I plan parties and force your father to sit still long enough so that people can see him , it isn 't because I want it . It 's because they need it . People like them . You think they need you because you choose nice china patterns ? This country was nothing before it had a king . It was Stone Age clans at war . It 's why I designed every inch of this monarchy as I did . The color of the flag down to , yes , the china . So they could have something larger than life to be inspired by . Decadence . Kings . Huge and poreless . You think I care about ballet ? They didn 't wait in line to see dancing . They came to see us . The royal family . We are the performance . I thought you loved ballet . ( SIGHS ) ( HEART MONITOR BEEPING ) HELEN : How long before we see a change ? Morning . We 'II know by morning . Hmm . I think of all the evenings I wasn 't there . Mornings I could stay through . You 're here now . You 're a pure thing found in the woods . You 're the only thing . ( MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY ) Fever 's spiking . He 's not responding . He 's crashing . I 'm bringing in my team . THOMASINA : You can 't . He 'II die if I don 't . I 'm bringing them in . Sir , we need to get you out of here . ( ALARM SOUNDING ) ( NURSES CHATTERING ) NURSE : Okay , come on . Bring the cart along . Your keys . Now . THOMASINA : We can take you wherever you want to go . I go alone . ( POLICE SIREN SOUNDING ) ( POLICE RADIO CHATTERING ) Arrested for treason . So , this is how it comes ? I seek counsel . Are you still hearing them ? Things usually go well for me . Of late , my plans are frustrated . I can 't lose what 's threatened tonight . And it hangs by threads . By minutes . What does He want from me ? Why does He act my enemy ? Port Prosperity . Is that the cost ? I 'II take it back . I 'II rescind the offer . I cannot tell you of God 's mind . He shares with me at His pleasure . And on the subject of Silas , He is silent . I did right by Him . This land was once a place where men of faith feared to walk the streets and prayers came in whispers . I made it safe for men like you . So , God owes you ? If not Him , you . Tell me what 's the fair trade . One offers sacrifice , according to the offense . Only you can name that . Sacrifice ? Has He not moved past that , yet ? Give Him my best . Tell Him I 've given too much . We make amends , Silas . The pure . The unblemished . For our sins . He wants what I will not let Him take . I will not leave this on the altar and live ... Then , you find another lamb . No . Not even God is that cruel . ( SIGHS ) ( GASPS ) ( WINDOW SHATTERING ) ( BANGING ON DOOR ) ( ANIMAL SCREECHING ) ( SIGHING ) Is this what you need ? Something beautiful has to die to make you happy ? JOSEPH : Jack , just talk to me . It can 't be like it was , Joseph . I can 't . I don 't understand . What happened ? Stay away . But I Iove you . ( PANTING ) ( GROANS ) I 'II get a beer . AII right . Watch it . Hey . Don 't touch me , dude . Hey , don 't touch me , man . Hey . You have a problem with my friend , here ? No . It 's cool . You backing away ? The Crown Pimp has to fight his own fights . I swing , your backup takes over . Yeah . That could ... ( LAUGHS ) That could be a problem for you . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Hey , hey , hey . Jack . Jack . Stay away from me . ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTING ) No . No ! No ! Just come here ! Hit me ! Hit me ! Hit me , man ! Go ahead . ( MEN GRUNTING ) ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) Let 's go . Let 's go . ( JACK GRUNTING ) Come on . Wait . Jack . My friends . They 'II be fine . Jack will take care of it . ( SIGHING ) He just dug a Iittle deeper . Mmm-hmm . Is this what it 's like out every night ? This part 's new . ( CAMERA CLICKING ) Sir . Are you all right ? Any change ? What do you call it when I go to the countryside ? Your code ? We don 't have a code . You have a code when I take too long in the bathroom . We say , " You 're in Serenity . " Then , Serenity ends . ( JACK LAUGHING ) Oh . It 's always midnight in the clock shop . I was starting to worry about you . Worried about me ? He was in good hands . Don 't sweat your buddies . They 're sleeping it off in a hotel . Not alone . ( BOTH LAUGH ) So , did you have a good time ? Did I do my job ? I don 't know why you 're being so nice to me . We 're in the same boat . ( LAUGHS ) ( SIGHS ) I 'm done for the night . You and claudia can have the other room . ID ? Now , hold it up to the camera , please . Are you here freely and of your own volition ? Go ahead . Let 's go . This might not be a good idea . ( LAUGHING ) It 's not . It 's a very bad idea . You don 't have to worry . I don 't need anything from you . I just want to take you in the other room and see what a real hero feels like . He didn 't fall asleep on you , did he ? He said to tell you he 's sorry . He couldn 't dig anymore . He left you ? I think the poor dope is in love and doesn 't know how to let go . He 's not Iike you at all . But it 's okay . You always have me . Wednesdays , Saturdays . Get out . ( LAUGHS ) What ? AII of you , get out ! I got the pictures . You still want to leak them ? Not so virtuous after all . SETH : Daddy ? Daddy ? Yes . Daddy came . He came . No . You have to go ? What is it ? The cost . HELEN : Silas ? Silas ? HELEN : Silas !

 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ... Kaliba was building something . John Henry was infiltrated . Someone out there wants to kill him . - Who 's John Henry ? - He 's my friend . Savannah 's survival may someday depend upon John Henry . What were you doing at the Weaver House ? - Why 'd you take the girl ? - To protect her . Girl 's in danger . When we jumped through time , you told me I died of cancer . - She 's lost weight . - What ? Let me talk to Weaver . I 'll meet with Sarah Connor . Make it happen . Put hands behind your head ! Kneel on the ground . I know you 've been told this already , but as I am a measure twice , cut once kind of carpenter , I do want to reiterate that you have the right to an attorney , if you are so inclined , and if you are not so inclined , anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . Not inclined . Fair enough and noted . So here 's where we come down on all this . Ten years ago , you murdered one Miles Dyson , employee of CyberDyne . Long time gone , but the man 's still dead , so we 've got that . Eight years ago , you and your son and a high school friend of his blow up a bank vault and die in the explosion . Now , of course , you 're still alive , which is inconvenient for many , but the bank 's still blown , so we 've got that . More recently , and by that I mean Monday , you participated in a firefight leaving five dead and kidnapping one Savannah Weaver , daughter of Catherine Weaver and citizen of Scotland , making this incident both federal and international . Two of the dead were off-duty law enforcement officers , and that usually gets you the needle . But in that , I do digress . - Agent Aldridge . - Yeah . You 're a funny boy . Well , that 's what Mom says . I never liked funny boys . I doubt they like you either , Ms. Connor . So there 's two ways I can bring your son into custody ... with your help , or dead . Which do you think it should be ? - My son ? - Your son , John Connor . - John is dead . - I don 't think so . - He died in the bank . - Oh , I don 't think so . I don 't think anyone died in the bank . - Well , you 're wrong . - Sometimes . But not today . Not yet . Think about it . ... was arrested and is now in local custody , facing a series of new charges as well as a host of old ones . Authorities are also on the lookout for Connor 's son John , as well as an unidentified female accomplice . What you see here are photos dating back eight years . Both fugitives would now be in their mid-20s . The FBI - - We should move . - This motel is out of the way . The desk clerk could have clocked us last night . Relocating within 24 hours of the incident has high risk factors . This room provides excellent sight lines down the highway . This is not an incident . This is my mother . I need a computer . I need to do research . You want the blueprints for the Los Angeles County Jail . Do I ? So you can plan how to get your mother out . But I 'm not going to let you do that . - You should know that by now . - I do know that by now . Then what is there to research ? Power sources . Shielded nuclear power sources . Like mine . Just like yours . Why ? I wanna know if being around them all the time can give you cancer . Also in the news today , authorities arrested Sarah Connor , A known domestic terrorist . Okay , it 's a large room . It 's dark , it 's quiet . It 's impossible to see . You may wanna roll a scan . I 'll roll a scan . I rolled a one . One . Okay ! Tough luck . You don 't see the umber hulk as it crawls from its nest in the stone and attacks you . You take ... three hit points of damage from a bite to the shoulder . I attack the umber hulk . Twenty . Wow . Okay , that 's ... Crit with the vorpal long sword to the umber hulk . Unbelievable . Lucky roll . Hello , Ms. Weaver . I just delivered a crit hit to the umber hulk . Congratulations . Mr. Murch . Who 's winning , Mr. Murch ? Well , it 's not really that kind of game . Although , I 'm a little bummed that he killed the umber hulk so fast . I 'm sure you 've considered the possibility he can roll whatever number he desires . Mr. Murch , how long will it take to disassemble everything and prepare it for transport ? Uh ... everything ? You mean like , everything ? Is that something you 're planning on doing ? No . But John Henry 's been attacked once . We should be prepared . John Henry was hacked . We fixed that . And besides , I - I think we 're past the point where moving the hardware 's a good idea . In fact , I think it 's ... Potentially a really , bad idea . Oh ? How 's that so ? For example , the other day , one of the fan wires on the server was ... glitchy . So we switched it out . Same wire , same length . Identical . Like , uh , changing a spark plug . - And ... - It sort of ... tweaked him . I 'm not sure what you 're getting at . What I 'm getting at is I think what we know to be John Henry , only exists as this specific collection of hardware and software ... Body and soul . We change a wire , we change John Henry . Yes . Mr. Murch . I 'm ready to confront the mind flayer now . Twenty . They followed me to the movie theater . I didn 't know , I swear . I just spent the last four hours convincing them we weren 't in this together . Maybe I should tell them we were . Maybe we were in this together . I just wanted the girl to be safe . - Well , so did I. - From whom ? I don 't know . You don 't know , or you can 't say ? I don 't know , but if I did , I probably couldn 't say . They wanna know what you 've been doing for the last ten years . What 'd you tell them ? I told them I have no idea what you 've been doing . What else could I tell them ? You can tell them . You can tell them everything you 've been doing . You can draw them a picture of everything they know and everything you know . If you 're innocent , you could do that . The last time I drew a picture ... I ended up in a psych ward . Maybe things will be different now . Maybe you got nothing to lose . There 's always something to lose . I am sorry for this . Yeah . Sure you are . - Where 's the girl ? - Back with her mother . Where else would a child be ? She 's not safe . She 's not safe . She 's not safe . Born To Run Transcript : Yyets. net Final Edits By : VeRdiKT - Agent ? - Mr. Ellison , come in . It 's open . This is where they stick us now . Pretty sure I know what the subtext is , but I refuse to read that deep . She 's not budging on the son . Maybe she 's telling the truth . Maybe she 's a liar lacking the proper motivation to telling the truth . But she 's got a guilty conscience . What makes you think that ? Well , for starters , she 's requested a priest . - What ? - Yep . Man of the cloth in the flesh . Black and white and God all over . Father Armando Bonilla ring a bell ? No . Can 't imagine what the connection is . Did it ever occur to you she might just wanna pray ? Not for a second . It occurs to me that other than a lawyer , a priest is the only other person she could ask to speak with that we can 't listen to . Buenas dias , Father . Buenas dias . Do you remember me ? You and your son were in my church . There was a problem with your daughter . At least , that is what you told me . Yeah . She 's better now . - Where is she ? - She 's in hiding . With my son . I don 't know where . And they are wanted . You have included them in your crimes . Do you believe in the Devil , Father ? The Devil . Do you believe in the actual Devil ? Something opposes God . Something tempts man into sin . I don 't know about God or Heaven ... but I do believe that someone or something wants this world to burn ... The Devil , demons ... I believe . And that day in the church , my daughter ... You saw things , didn 't you ? I pray ... every day ... to understand ... what happened that day . I can explain it to you . I don 't know if you 'll believe me , but I can explain it to you . And after I 'm done , I 'm gonna ask you to do something for me . Will you do something for me ? Mr. Ellison , welcome back . How are your friends in law enforcement ? How are your friends in law enforcement , Mr. Ellison ? They 're very determined . What is this ? Sarah Connor is talking with a priest . Father Armando Bonilla . I can see that . Why is it here ? Why are you watching it ? John Henry monitors all law enforcement channels . Seems prudent . It seems illegal . So 's lying to the FBI . I don 't think now 's the time to be parsing which laws we 'll be obeying and which we will not . Now 's not the time . I heard her when she said it . Those cameras should be off . I want to meet him . The priest ? No , the boy . You wanna meet John Connor ? Someone 's attacked my family . They may attack again . I think he knows something . And besides , he saved my daughter ... and I want to thank him . Thank you . Can we talk outside ? It 's a bad idea . I don 't know what you think John knows . I know he was at my House when the attacker showed up . I want to know why . His mother thinks he 's a Messiah . I want to know why . And despite your reluctance to tell me , I surmise that he and his cyber companion are connected to the John Henry body , and I want to know why . Yes . She 's a cyborg . Don 't pretend you didn 't know . She 's dangerous . And you think I need protecting . That 's sweet . But don 't ever lie to me again . Now . About John Connor ... I don 't know how to find him . Well , I do . Twenty ! - Can I help you ? - Yes . How ? - Ammo ? - Silencers . You know we can 't sell that kinda stuff . Ask to speak to Manny . I want to speak to Manny . Call the number first . Then ask . You know , I always thought the best things about those guns was the sound . No , it 's not . How much weight has she lost ? You think she has cancer because she 's lost weight . So how much weight has she lost ? 11 % of her mass in the last six weeks . She was healthy before you showed up . That 's all I know . She was healthy . If my power source was leaking radiation , I would know . I have sensors for that . - Where are they ? - You can 't see them . No , of course not . So I just have to trust you on it . Stuff does go wrong with you , doesn 't it ? Stuff breaks ... You kill birds , you twitch . You try to murder me . You 're not perfect . You 're a machine . Mom ! Uh , yes , I remember you . Buenos dias to you too , Father . Underneath the bench , there is an envelope . I hope it is enough . Is all I could find . I have a message for you , as well . What 's wrong ? The IDs are flawless . They 're flawless . There 's nothing else there . There 's nothing hidden there . No secret message there for her escape . I am to tell you this . From your mother . Leave this place . As soon as it is safe . Leave this place . Do not think of her . Do not come for her . Leave . You are to make sure that he does . We lose everybody we love . - She said that ? - No . Hasta luego . That 's interesting . Let me repeat . I had nothing to do with your mother 's arrest . If I had ... there 'd be a SWAT team outside your door right now . And the same thing would happen to this SWAT team as happened to your last one . Catherine Weaver would like to meet you . Why ? She wants to thank you for saving Savannah . Well , she just did . Your mother wanted to meet her . Well , when my mother gets out , trust me , she will . I told Ms. Weaver you 'd never come without your mom . She said , if that was the case , I 'm supposed to ask one question . She says I 'm supposed to ask you . Will you join us ? She says she hopes you 'll know what that means . Do you know what that means ? No , I don 't . Please leave now , Mr. Ellison . I think you 've said enough . John ... You 've said enough , Mr. Ellison . I won 't ask you again . He upset you . Me ? I think he upset you . You know that 's impossible . Is it ? You said it yourself , John . I 'm just a machine . I believe you . You believe me what ? I believe they are machines . I believe they 've come back from the future to first kill you and then your son . I believe in time travel . I believe in cyborgs . I believe there 's a world that I 've not yet seen . But you have , and John . In the last eight hours , I 've received 37 calls from people who have met a young man named John Baum or his sister , Cameron or Sarah Baum , the mother . They now know her to be Sarah Connor . By all accounts , your son looks 16 and not 24 , just as you look 35 and not 43 . I believe you have participated in the miraculous and the terrible , and through it all , you have maintained a moral and good soul . I want to help you . I want to help your son . Help me do that . My son is dead . Do you know who Danny Dyson is ? Danny ? Miles Dyson 's son . - Do you know where he is ? - No . Why ? He 's been missing for three months . Hey .

I know what happened . I saw it happen . Can any data be recovered ? I can try , but it 's highly doubtful . We need to know what it knows , who sent it . It 's safe to assume my brother sent it . Mr. Ellison , where have you been ? Where have I been ? It 's 7 : 00 in the morning . I 've been asleep . Didn 't you get my message ? It was very disappointing . Did you give the message exactly as I said it ? Of course . Look , I told you before . She 'll never leave his side , and he 'll never leave his mother 's . - We 'll see . - We 'll see . Don 't do that . My mom used to do that . I really hate that . What 's going on ? You need to understand how it works . What ? This chip . This body . The software is designed to terminate humans . The hardware is designed to terminate humans . That 's our sole function . Not you . No . Not anymore . But what was there is still there . And will always be there . So down deep ... You wanna kill me . Yes , I do . Then why don 't you ? I might someday . I need to show you something . This body ... Get on top of me . Put your knee here . Right here . If I 'm damaged , we should know . Reach down under the breast plate . There . What does it feel like ? Cold . That 's good , right ? That 's good . That 's perfect . John . It 's time to go . Buenos dias , Father Bonilla . Buenos dias . So . Door ! You did what I asked ? - I did . - And ? Why are you here ? They have a message for you . She 's coming . I don 't know what to do .

 Previously on Heroes ... I 'm going home . I 'm scared for my life , okay ? - I know . - Do you ? I 'm just not like you . And this thing here , just pretend it never happened , okay ? I 'm haitianing you . We 're pretending that we 've never been to the Burnt Toast Diner . I came to warn you { \ , peter } . You need to know the truth . The answer you seek is here . - What do you got ? - { \ It 's a } A body . - What is it ? - It 's me . One touch , Nathan , and it 's over . { o , d } Don 't touch him . You touch him . He 's got my power . - His mind will go back into his body . - Take my hand now . Do it now . - I said , get away . - Back away . I need you to go back eight weeks , { \ , Hiro , } to a motel room in Texas . To save his life ? No , to save that film before he destroyed it . Once you return , deliver it to me , your sweet Charlie will be set free . I have your film . Now I want Charlie . { \ pos ( 230,240 ) } Soon . { \ pos ( 285,240 ) } This is entry number four . { \ pos ( 270,210 ) } When two or more of these forces are proximate , { \ pos ( 270,210 ) } they amplify exponentially , { \ pos ( 210,250 ) } like a kind of gravity or magnetism . { \ pos ( 210,250 ) } An abnormal spike in seismic activity as of late appears to be { \ pos ( 210,250 ) } emanating from one of the individuals being held here . - A pregnant woman . - Doctor ! - He 's crowning . - And I fear ... I fear that this child may indeed ... I 'm coming . It 's okay . It 's okay . Butterfly man , open up . You can 't avoid me . I can see you in there . Open up ! You are in there , I know ! Come out ! Butterfly man ! Hiro , is that you making all that noise ? I 've done what you asked . Now , { \ * please } tell me where and when you put Charlie . It 's beautiful out , isn 't it ? Makes a man glad to be alive . It feels poetic that today is the day we give thanks . Stop ignoring me , butterfly man . I want Charlie . { \ And } You will have her . But there are more pressing matters to discuss . That film that you retrieved , it 's brought everything into focus . I discovered the truth about my destiny . Our destiny . - Give me Charlie . - Sorry . Not yet . { \ * Feeling brave , Samurai warrior ? } There 's a nice sharp ax right over there . Go on . Freeze time . Chop me into bits . No , that 's right . You can 't . 'cause if you kill me , you 'll never find Charlie . I 'm your savior , Hiro . You just don 't know it yet . Now go help set the table . And smile . It 's Thanksgiving . - So when should I expect you ? - Oh , I don 't know . { \ Well , } You 've got to come . Happy Thanksgiving . I just don 't know that I 'm in the mood . Come on . You can invite Gretchen . Actually , I can 't . She moved all the way across campus . I 'm sorry to hear that . And that 's my fault , isn 't it ? It 's okay . It wasn 't gonna work out anyway . So I guess it 's official . I 'm a social pariah . And I haven 't helped things much . I want to make it up to you , starting with a real Bennet family Thanksgiving dinner ... Turkey , trimmings , the whole thing . What do you say ? And since when do you cook ? Well , you know , I 'm learning as I go . Is that a yes ? I don 't know . Is Lyle coming ? No , he sends his regrets . He can 't get away from school . Don 't make me be alone with your mother and Doug . She 's bringing the new boyfriend ? { \ Oh , } She never goes anywhere without him . It would mean a lot to me { \ , Claire } . Okay . There 's something I 've been meaning to talk to you about anyway . Great , I 'll see you at 4 : 30 . Don 't be late . Love you . - Oh , my God . - Lauren . Of all the supermarkets in all the towns in all the world . - It 's great to see you . - You too . Well , what are you doing in Washington ? Well , after Primatech exploded , I was kind of unemployed . CIA seemed like the obvious choice . And you ? You know , a little bit of this , a little bit of that . - All right . - Mostly that . - I got a place in Dupont circle . - Nice . What brings you to this side of town ? These yams . These canned yams . I love them , and I can 't get ' em anywhere else . Didn 't peg you for a yam man . Oh , yeah , big yam man . You 're stalking me , aren 't you ? Yes , but I am also cooking Thanksgiving dinner for my daughter and my ex-wife . Ex-wife . Yes . Sandra left me . Can 't say as I really blame her , but we 're still on good terms . I mean , hence the oversized bird . Are you having Thanksgiving on Christmas ? Because this frozen beast is not gonna thaw until tomorrow . You need one of those already-cooked birds . Follow me . Thanks . I appreciate it . 'cause I 'm not exactly an expert in ... life skills . How many people ? Four . Five , if you would like to join us . That is , if you don 't already have plans . And by the way you 're sizing up my single-serve turkey pot pie , you 've already surmised that I don 't have plans . It would be great to catch up . Happy Thanksgiving . Mom ... Please , set up in there , boys . What is this ? - Where 's your brother , honey ? - That 's a good question . Would you please put these in a bowl for me ? We need to talk . { \ * Yes , } I know . That 's what Thanksgiving 's all about . Just families sharing our lives . Thank you , gentlemen . Okay , and please remember to stir some milk into that . That 's the way your brother likes it . I went to a storage unit yesterday { \ , mom } . Rented out to you . Saw Nathan 's dead body . Rene told you about that . Well , it was not your brother 's body you saw . It was a shape-shifter posing as your brother . It 's the worst kind of identity theft . And he had to be stopped , and then we had to store him away discreetly . You can imagine if the press had gotten wind . Matt { \ Parkman } also said that ... Matt Parkman said what ? Officer Parkman is unbalanced . Suicidal , last I heard . Because Sylar 's in his head ? Is that right ? What did you do , ma ? Is my brother really dead ? Answer him , mom . We 'd all like to hear that one . Happy Thanksgiving , Nathan . So , if you two will just help me set the table , we will sit down like a family and we will discuss everything . Let go of me , Nathan . Answer him . It 's Thanksgiving , and you are my family . And we will sit down like a family as we do every year , or I will leave here , and you will never hear from me again . Your choice . - Hello . - Hey . Happy Thanksgiving . Come on in . Something smells good . Look at this place . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Are you sure this is your apartment ? We clean up good . So what can I get you ? Some sparkling cider ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } No , I 'm all right , but before everyone gets here , { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } I do want to talk to you about something . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } { \ Okay , } Just let me check the gravy first , okay ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Oh , I got that . Claire , you remember Lauren ? She worked with me at primatech . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Hi . You 're all grown-up . You look beautiful . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } It 's okay . I 've got this , Wolfgang . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Thanks . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Does mom know you brought a date ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } No , Lauren 's not a date . She 's an old friend . She 's helping me cook . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } She is so a date . - You should have told mom . - Your mother will understand . We 're a complex , modern family , and ... { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } She 's got Doug . So what did you want to talk about ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Hold that thought . - Happy Thanksgiving . - You too . Good boy . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Hey , Noah . Happy Thanksgiving . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } - A host gift . - Thanks , Doug . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Come on in . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } - Hi . - How are you ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Good . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Who 's your little friend ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Dame Penelope Jean Lovegood III . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } But you can call her Ms. Lovegood . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Can 't she , snookums ? Yes , she can . Yes , she can . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Claire , you remember Doug . Enchanté . Dinner 's ready { \ , everyone } . You hired a cook ? No , that 's Lauren . { \ pos ( 230,260 ) } Mistaken for a domestic . That certainly breaks the ice . Lauren Gilmore . It 's nice to finally meet you , Sandra . { \ pos ( 260,260 ) } Okay . Let 's eat . You brought a date ? That 's Lauren . Okay . Who 's hungry ? { \ pos ( 260,260 ) } Got lots to eat . Come on . Not a fan of Thanksgiving ? I 'm from japan . { \ pos ( 250,230 ) } We celebrate Kinro Kansha , not Thanksgiving . { \ pos ( 220,210 ) } What 's the matter { \ , hiro } ? You can talk to me . We 're family . { \ pos ( 220,210 ) } I 'm not part of this family . I 'm a prisoner . - No one 's a prisoner here . - Samuel broke his promise . { \ pos ( 220,210 ) } I fixed the past , but he won 't give me back Charlie . He 's a liar and an evil man . { \ pos ( 270,270 ) } If the time traveler fixed the past , where 's Joseph ? That 's a good question . You got a minute , Hiro ? Come inside . We need to talk . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Tell me , what did you do when you fixed the past for Samuel ? I 'm sorry . I cannot say . Samuel might get mad , and Charlie 's at stake . I understand . I have to change for dinner . You stay a minute , will you ? You know , Hiro , we can help each other . - I could use my ability . - Really ? I can be inside of your soul . We can be ... as one . Painted lady , I think you are trying to seduce me . But you should know my heart belongs to Charlie . I 'm sorry ... If I 'm making you uncomfortable . { \ * I can help you . } But ... I need contact , closeness to make this work . Of course . Every ability has a different ... set of rules . I can feel what you feel , Hiro . Touch me . You want Charlie back desperately . And now Samuel 's forcing you to work for him . Why didn 't he have you save his brother Joseph ? I don 't know . You should ask Samuel . He 'll never tell me . You need to take me back . Eight weeks ago , when a man { \ * from the government } came to the carnival and murdered Joseph . - I don 't think I should ... - Please . I need to know the truth . You made us time travel . We must go back . - Is that the man that killed Joseph ? - No , that 's Dr. Suresh . - We need to talk . - Joseph ? - I 'm behind on my chores . - Forget the chores . This is not good . All right , brother . But not here . Is this it ? Is this the night that Joseph gets murdered ? I don 't know . But it is very dangerous to be here . We must go before we step on a ... Butterfly . Okay , mom , you got us here , sitting , just like you wanted . So talk . Peter , where are your manners ? Nathan , would you please say grace ? It 's Thanksgiving , Nathan . It 's the one day we should express our gratitude . What do I have to be grateful for ? I 'm dead . He knows it . You know it . Why don 't you tell us why and put us all out of our misery ? Tell us . I don 't expect you to understand or approve of the decision I made , but I hope you can keep an open mind and not condemn it . Sylar was gonna kill the president , and you two had flown off to stop him at that hotel in Washington . And I had a dream about you , Nathan . I saw you fighting for your life . I also saw Matt Parkman save you . But I panicked and I went and found him , and I dragged him to the hotel . - But by the time we got there ... - I was already dead . I made Matt Parkman do it . This is the part where I ask you to forgive me . So that body that we saw ... That was Nathan . Technically ... yes . But ... as far as the world is concerned , Nathan is still alive . Yeah , but I 'm not me . It 's your mind . They are your memories . You look exactly the same . You are Nathan Petrelli . You are my son . You 're Peter 's brother . And it 's been this way for months . Just because you know the truth , nothing has to change . We are still a family . To us . I would like to propose a toast to all of you for being here on this my first Thanksgiving in this apartment , my first Thanksgiving I 've ever hosted . I ... And that 's especially to Lauren . Without her , we would all be eating Japanese takeout right now . So Sandra , how did you and Doug meet ? - May I ? - Please . It was love at first sight . For Mr. Muggles and Ms. Lovegood , that is . We met at the groomer . My little angel wouldn 't stop barking until they put her cage right next to his , am I right { \ * , Sandy } ? It 's true . Nasty . - Dougy 's allergic . - Legume-intolerant . So how did the two of you meet ? Well , Lauren and I used to work together at Primatech . And we ... we recently reconnected . { \ * Yeah , } This morning , actually . Frozen food aisle . I troll the place for eligible men . Primatech . Is that the paper company or that other thing ? You know about that other thing ? Yes , dear . A memory can be erased only so many times . So you worked closely then ? - It wasn 't like that , you know . - Or am I ... stumbling onto something that I 'm not supposed to remember ? You 're not stumbling onto anything . I think we should all just enjoy our Thanksgiving dinner . You know , in my family , on Thanksgiving , we used to go around the table and everyone would say what they were thankful for . Okay , I 'll go first . I am thankful for the two beautiful women in my life ... Ms. Lovegood and my beautiful Sandy . Nice . I am thankful that my daughter Claire decided to come for Thanksgiving . It would not be the same without her . I 'll second that . I 'm thankful for canned yams . How about you , Claire ? I know that I should be thankful , but I 'm just not feeling it right now . Is everything okay ? Her roommate moved out . Why on earth would she do that ? You 're so likable . Doug , you don 't know anything about me . What ? You want to talk about it right now ? Fine . I 'm thinking about dropping out of school . My family ... This will surely be a Thanksgiving ... to remember . Where 's Lydia ? Not { \ * really } sure . Amanda , sweetheart , where 's your mother ? I think she went to go find the Japanese man . Did she now ? Happy Thanksgiving . That man from India , he wasn 't writing a book . He wanted to talk about me . You sent me away , but I stayed , I listened , I heard everything . - How long have you been lying to me { \ , huh } ? - You need to calm down , brother . Then stop controlling me . - Stop manipulating my emotions . - Fine . You want me to let go . I will . My whole life , you 've kept me under your thumb . Why ? Because you 're dangerous { \ , Samuel } . What 's that supposed to mean ? - Oh , never mind . - No , tell me what you meant . You can move the earth { \ , Samuel } . But it 's more than that . Cities . Mountains . You have the power to kill millions . I can 't let that happen . I always thought I was missing out on something . Some untapped potential . Just tell me how . How can I be that powerful ? I 've already said too much . You think I wanted this life ? You had to be controlled . From the day you were born , I gave up everything to watch over you . Let me free you of that burden . Show me the film . Let me learn what I am . - Take responsibility for myself . - Too late . I told Dr. Suresh to burn it . Why would you do that ? You can never know the truth . I 've made arrangements . A man from the government is coming to take you in . I gave him a compass . You 've betrayed me . My entire life , you 've betrayed me . I 'm still your brother . I love you . God , what have I done ? What have I done ? He 's coming . He 's coming . I know that you guys are freaking out , but I don 't think college is where I 'm supposed to be . Is this about Gretchen ? Because that is one relationship . Yeah , it is about Gretchen . And it 's about Becky , - and { \ it 's about } everything that 's happened . - Who 's Becky ? Mom , look , I just don 't think that I belong in college . { \ * And } Where do you think you belong , or have you even thought about it yet ? Maybe I 'll go for a year abroad . Maybe I 'll go backpack through Europe . A job . I just need to find somewhere where I fit in , where I could be myself . And the $ 40,000 I just gave to the school , where { \ do you think } that should go ? I don 't know { \ , dad } . Where 'd it come from ? This is about what that guy Samuel said { \ * right } ? Who is Samuel ? What is going on ? - Maybe it is . - How could you even consider - listening to him ? - { \ What is happening ? } What did your father do ? This is not about dad . It 's about me . I can 't lie anymore . I 'm a freak , and people don 't like freaks . - Can I just interject something here ? - No ! { \ I think that } We should all just take a deep breath . All I was gonna say is that what Claire is feeling is perfectly normal . I mean , we 've all felt like we didn 't fit in at one point or another in our lives . Heck , growing up and discovering I had a penchant for dog breeding , you think I had any friends ? Trust me , Claire , this will all blow over . Really ? Is it , Doug ? Do you think that this is going to blow over ? What are you doing ? Jeez . How 's that for normal ? Great . { \ fad ( 500,500 ) } { \ PRESENT DAY } Get more wine . - I have to tell them . - No . You can 't say anything . If someone finds out I took you to the past , I will never see Charlie again . { \ césure ? } I have something special . I 'll be right back . - Please . - I 'm sorry , Hiro . But we have to stand up to him . Some things are just too important . Where you been , friend ? I got lost . Well , now you 're found . Something going on over here ? Something in your hair . Well , then , you must be starved . Join me . Make yourself useful . Pass the chair , will you ? Guess he 's never seen her regen before . - So some dinner , huh ? - Par for the course . Especially when it comes to my ex-husband . I don 't know what 's going on between him and Claire . { \ * Well , } I don 't know either , { \ * But } I think that Thanksgiving dinner was just his way of letting Claire know that she has a family that loves her . Nothing wrong with that . I thought you gave up all this . Yeah , so did I. And then I come across this compass , which almost gets me killed . It turns out it belongs to the strange man who shows up in my daughter 's dorm room threatening the normal life she so desperately wants . Well , maybe it 's impossible . Maybe I 'm just not supposed to have a normal life . It sounds like you 're giving up . Why did you cut yourself ? I don 't know . Maybe ... because you guys all think that you know what it 's like to be me , but you don 't . How could you possibly ? I have to lie to everyone . Otherwise , they faint . I know that it has been hard , and I know that I have caused you pain , but I 'm concerned about you , Claire . These are not good people . They 're dangerous . You just have to trust me on this . Would you stop treating me like I 'm a child ? Then stop acting like one . Let me get this . - Sorry I 'm late . - Hey , come on in . Who 's ready for pie ? Is there a problem , mom ? Some family . You look at me , you don 't see your son . You see the man who killed your son . Don 't be silly . You don 't see your brother . Well , that 's because I 'm not your brother . Guess again . God , Sylar 's in there with you , isn 't he ? We never should have gone to Texas , Pete . It feels good to finally be me again . What 's for dinner ? I 'm starved . You know what makes this meal truly special ? It 's knowing that each and every one of you had a hand in making it happen . Just as we 've had a hand in each other 's lives , in our shared destiny . Heaven . We have depended on each other for so long . Through good times and bad . But tonight , we should be especially thankful . The future ... is here . And it will be greater than my brother { \ * Joseph } could ever have imagined . But I can 't tell you about it yet . Not while there 's a traitor in our midst . I just learned that the person who killed my brother is here , sitting at this table . It 's time we all knew the truth , isn 't it ? Tell them , Samuel . You murdered Joseph . The time traveler saw it . Really ? Is that what you saw , Hiro ? I 'm sorry . I have to think about Charlie . - I didn 't see anything . - We know what you did . Why so angry , Edgar ? Is it because you 've done something ... shameful ? You killed Joseph , didn 't you ? You betrayed us to the government . And when Joseph found out , you killed him . You lying bastard . What have you done ? I saved your life . Look . Thanks . - I 'm gonna finish him . - No , you can 't hurt him . He 's the only one who knows where Charlie is . He killed Joseph . I know , but this is not the time for revenge . Sometimes a hero has to run away to live to fight another day . We will defeat him . I promise you . I 'll hold you to that . Only the guilty turn tail and run . Edgar is gone . Good riddance . I feel like I haven 't eaten in months . You think that 's some kind of existential soul thing ? You have a soul ? Come on , buddy . That 's the best you got ? No big speeches about hope ? Triumph of the human spirit ? Why don 't you let me out of this chair and find out ? And you ... You have raised the evil incarnate bar to an entirely new level . Thank you ... For giving me something to strive for . All this talk of ... souls and ... spirits sends my head spinning . I am not ... a religious man . But ... there is one thing I do believe in . Blood . Time to carve the turkey . Get away from her . What 's happening ? It 's Nathan . He 's in there . Come on , fight him , Nathan . { \ * Come on , } Fight him . Nathan 's dead . No , he isn 't . He 's still in you . His spirit and his mind are fighting for his family . Come on , Nathan ! Nathan , fight him . What have you done to me ? - Thanks . - I 'm so sorry . It 's okay . So my dad called you ? Yeah , well , he said you were feeling low , and he knew I was feeling low , so ... How 's your new roommate ? Fine . Dull . Actually , it 's awful . No one 's tried to kill me for days now . And she 's a slob . Well , you know , the other side of the room is still available . Sorry . You 're right . I don 't know ... why you would ever want to move in with me again . Maybe because of all the people that I 've met in college so far , you 're the only one who 's ever made any sense to me . Now see , I told you you were gonna have fun . - What do you think about Christmas ? - How about a movie ? Much better . Should I give you my number or were you just planning - on stalking me in the produce aisle ? - Canned goods I think it was . My home number is on the back . Use it . - Happy Thanksgiving . - You too . Good night , ladies . Nice meeting you . We 're leaving , Claire . Happy Thanksgiving . Sorry about Doug . He 's fine . I told him he ate a peanut . He 's not the sharpest tack , but he 's a good man . Never a dull moment , Noah . - Not if I can help it . - Thank you . I 'm gonna go wait in the car . - Thanks for the invite , Mr. Bennet . - Anytime . I guess ... " I 'm sorry " doesn 't begin to cover it ? No , it 's not your fault . I 'm just ... I know { \ * , I know } . You 've got a lot to figure out . I just want you to take your time and really think about your choices , because you do have choices . - You 're absolutely right . - So you 're going back to school ? Yeah , classes start Monday , and I will be there . { \ * That 's } Great news . - Love you . - Love you . And thank you for inviting Gretchen . I wasn 't overreaching ? No , it was actually the perfect dad thing to do . Next Thanksgiving , your place . It 's a date . Ready to head back ? Actually , no . We have a couple days off before classes start , and ... I want to find out where this leads . Where 'd you get that ? I stole it from my dad . He said I had choices . And I want to know what they are . And this is going to lead me to ' em . A compass ? - Okay . - You up for an adventure ? It 's okay if you 're not . I understand . I mean ... We might run into Becky there . Yeah , she 's not one of my favorite people . But you are . So which way ? Take a right . You saved Edgar . How honorable . Of course , when you betray me , you put Charlie in danger . Your brother was right . You are powerful . But I am powerful too . I 'll make it so you never see her again . You won 't do that . You still need me . So ... you tell me exactly when and where Charlie is , or I am leaving . And you will be the one who is lost . I like this . Little man standing up for himself . But you don 't actually think I 'd ever let you leave , do you ? - You don 't have a choice . - I always have a choice . How do you feel , Hiro ? { \ Must rescue Waston ... } { \ Beam me up , Scotty ... } What have you done ? I 'm gonna find him , and I 'm gonna bring him back , mom . It 's over . It isn 't possible anymore . The one thing I know , the one thing I can count on since all this started , is that anything is possible . It 's Sylar . Nobody wants him dead more than me . You want to know what I want even more ? My brother alive . I 'll find a way . { \ fad ( 500,500 ) } { \ TO BE CONTINUED }

 Security breach . Security breach . Hey , Matty . Dispatch to one-one-three . Dispatch to one-one-three . Are you there , Reardon ? Who wants to know ? Don 't tell me you don 't recognize my sultry tones . Are you reading Cosmo Girl again ? Don 't start . I told you not to read that crap . It doesn 't work on me . What do you want ? Hey , lover boy , I gotta drive to grab some food . Do you want anything ? Just a sec . What are you gettin ' ? Food . Nah , I 'm brown baggin ' it today . Suit yourself . Say hi to your future ex-girlfriend . Is this another one of your social calls or we 're actually making a living here ? The old man Jenkins called in . Something about a trespasser . Said the guy was dressed funny , kind of military looking . Said this guy was heading across his property , then he ducked in the old 48 . What the heck was he thinking going into the old 48 ? Well , old man Jenkins took a shot at him . He didn 't hit him , though . This guy could be in there for hours . Or days . Well , there 's only one way out of there . Yeah , that 's if he finds it . I 'm about 30 minutes away from the exit . I 'll go check it out . Are you sure ? There 's nothing going on here . I 'm on my way . Hey , Lins , don 't be afraid to call for backup . I won 't . You know me . How did he get out ? Out through the duct system . He inadvertently manages to skip all our security stairs . He 's out of the complex and across the yard before we could even mark the exits . There are people with broken arms , broken legs . A couple of fractured skulls . So , he 's precise . I 've sent off Mr. Beck with his search team . In the meantime , clear the facility of nonessential personnel . I 'm gonna need statements from all the victims . That 's gonna take some time . You know , Dr. Voller , I 'm torn . Part of me is apopleptic at the thought that the program has been compromised . If we don 't get this locked down in 24 hours , we 're gonna have a national crisis of Brobdingnagian proportions on our hands . What 's the other part ? I feel like a kid . on Christmas morning . He 's doing just what we programmed him to do . One last thing . The corporation sent security of their own to investigate . Oh , crap . Who ? Fraser . How much time to tidy up before she gets here ? Uh , she 's already here . Dr. Hart . Ms. Fraser , always a pleasure . Got a lock on your escaped convict ? No ? Can I help you ? We 're looking for Deputy Reardon . She 's out on a call . Something I can do for you ? Ship the old 48 exit , ' cause we can 't seem to find it on our maps . That 's just a name locals have given an old mine north of here . You wanna check it out . The Inn down the road 's got some hand-drawn maps . We are really in a kind of a hurry . I 'm thinking , why don 't you just tell us where it is ? You wanna wait ' till the sheriff gets back . He can answer any of your questions . Are you are here alone ? Hey , there . How 're you doing ? Hello . Anyone who 's grown up around here knows there 's only one way out of the old 48 . You actually made it . What are you doing ? I 'm running . You running from something or running to something ? I 'm running . Well , uh , it 's pretty far out here . Are you lost ? No . You , uh , you do realize that you were trespassing , right ? All right , sir . Don 't move . Don 't move , okay ? Just stay where you are . One-one-three to dispatch . One-one-three to dispatch . Larkin , are you there ? Matty , are you there ? Sir , do you have a name ? Slr , I asked you if you had a name . We 're closing in , guys . Be ready . A quarter mile . Slr . Don 't move Sir , back behind the car . Now ! Jeez . I need your weapon . Take cover . Matt , come in . Matt , this is Lins . Come in ! Anyone there ? You came a long way . I did . It 's time to come home . It 's okay . Come on . No . I sorted everything out . No more crazy exercises . I do not believe you . I 'm giving you a direct order , Soldier . I will not comply . I gotta tell you , I think different . What ? Drive . Son of a ... He 's dead . He 'll bleed out . No , we didn 't hit him enough . Give me the dispatch tape to those two cops talking . Someone plant that gun back at the cop station . Quit your whining . Get him to medical . Tell Hart the rabbit is still loose . And someone change that flat tire . You 're bleeding . It will stop . That 's it ? That 's all you 're gonna say ? I saw what they did ! I saw you take those hits . Look at you . You should be lying in pieces back there . Okay . You know , I 'm gonna pull over . No . What do you mean no ? When there 's enough distance between us and them , I will let you go . Turn off here . You , uh , you gonna tell me where we 're going ? I am kind of the driver . I don 't know . Drive . Who the hell were those guys ? Who are you ? My name is Isaac . Isaac . Intuitive Synthetic Autonomous Assault Commando . I thought this guy was ex-death row . Sounds more like a robot . No , he 's human . Issac is the classified project name for which our elusive friend is the opponent 's prototype . " I " for intuitive , because he can instinctively reason his way through any combat situation . This is where being a convicted murderer comes in handy . Actually , his brain 's been modified . All his natural senses have been heightened . He 's the purest example of the human animal . He 's been reprogrammed for just one thing . Survival . " S. " Synthetic . His physical makeup has been enhanced with selected D NA , and his molecular structure has been intensified with a variety of synthetic polymers . So he 's kind of a best of a best scenario on a genetic level . Yes , exactly . And as with most amphibians , if you cut off their tail , they 'll grow a new one . Thanks to recent advances in nanotechnology , Isaac is the world 's first regenerative human . Nanotechnology . Nanobots . Nanorobotics , to be more precise , Ms. Fraser . The technology of engineering machines that function on a microscopic scale . Yeah . They 're strictly a hypothetical concept . Actually , we 've had the technology for over a year . Isaac 's blood stream is literally swarming with nanobots . He suffers even the slightest damage , they all work together to rebuild him . Like a little molecular pit crew . To what extent ? I mean , can he sustain puncture wounds , gunshots ? Oh , yeah . He 's bulletproof ? No , no . He 's not bulletproof . He 's bullet resistant . If you shoot Isaac enough , like a lot of times , you might be able to kill him . But generally speaking , our buddy is a walking self-healing machine . His metabolism is off the charts . He 's like a friend of yours who keeps eating and eating and never gains a pound . I would know . I 'm that friend for my friends . So , autonomous assault commando . You can imagine . Yeah , I can imagine . So , what are we doing sitting around here ? You need to know what you 're up against . Excuse me . Simon Hart . Well , that is most unfortunate . What ? What do you smell ? Nothing . Well , whoever it was , they sure left in a hurry . Judging from the width of those skid marks , it was pretty heavy . Possibly military . Which would seem to support the presence of these nine-millimeter shell casings . No manufacturer 's stamp . They used military ammunition . Now , we got a concentration of shell casings over here . So , whoever did the shooting got out , kept on firing . We got boot prints over there by the side of the road . Heavy treads , size 11 or so . A lot of big boys . So what were they shooting at ? Oh . Ho-ho . So , whoever your theoretical military guys were theoretically aiming for ... Theoretically ruptured their engine block . Darn it . You keep another container of oil ? No . Another container of oil might allow us to continue . A helpful hint though that might be . Still doesn 't change the fact that I don 't have one . But thanks , Captain Logic . My name is Isaac . Right . Your name is Isaac . How could I forget ? We need to keep moving . Yeah . Great . Your dispatcher 's likely been killed . Well , you don 't know that . You weren 't able to reach him earlier . So ? That doesn 't mean anything . If your dispatcher 's been killed , that would explain why he didn 't take your radio call . That 's only logical . If you 're lucky , I will be captured soon , and you will no longer be of any use to me . If not , they will find you and they will kill you after you 've led them to me . Who are they ? That information is classified . Well , Matt isn 't dead . You 've a personal connection with him . We 're friends . You were friends . All available evidence points to his elimination . You know , you don 't know what you 're talking about . Jeez . Personal connections are counterproductive , and they need to be avoided at all costs . They make one emotionally vulnerable . Is that your , uh , philosophy of life ? What is this , this mission ? We need to keep moving . So , we 're dealing with a sentient being ? Issac , on the other hand , experiences neither emotion nor pain . It 's human . Was . Hasn 't occurred to you that he might 've broke out for a reason ? Some kind of memories ? We wiped his memory . A toaster doesn 't burn your bread because it was abused as a child . Dr. Voller will remain here in constant contact . Ms. Fraser will accompany me to where Isaac was last seen . There 's a load of people back at head office who 'd be interested to know that their investment is out there running around unaccounted for . Just a couple of concerns . Time is of the essence . Ms. Fraser , you go ahead . Just let me confer with Dr. Voller for a minute . What are you exactly doing ? She 's been debriefed a whole half an hour . She was gonna find out sooner or later . I decided it was gonna be sooner . I don 't want her left here alone . What do you think she 's gonna do ? It 's not what I think . It 's what I know . I don 't want her nosing around here unattended . She 's a security expert I don 't want her anywhere near the project 's computer systems . She 's a woman . In charge . Do you trust her ? Ah , that looks promising . No , really , go ahead . I know you guys are scientists and all , but next time you wanna build a synthetically modified super soldier , The problem with installing a beacon within Isaac is that it makes him extremely vulnerable to enemy forces . You can 't scramble the code ? We built an analog superhero for a digital world . We have to find him the old-fashioned way . Wow . See , you know , what you 're doing it 's just kinda freaking me out . Why ? Why do you ask ? Well . Oh , Jesus . Who is Jesus ? You speak of him a lot . Yet , he never answers . Is he dead as well ? Sometimes I wonder . When I 'm finished repairing myself , I 'll require food . Oh , ha-ha , you eat , huh ? I do . Aren 't you cold ? No . Well , do me a favor . When you 're , uh , done with all that , won 't you put this on , huh ? Hey , uh , Issac . Yes ? Are you , um , are you human ? I do not understand the question . Well , you know , like , um , where did you come from ? Do you , uh , do you have a family ? Oh , dear . Did you lose your memory ? Why were you on the road ? Well , you know , except running . Leaving . Leaving , huh ? Leaving from what ? Did you locate food ? No . What ? Why are there heads on the wall ? What ? Animal heads on the wall . Oh , um , it 's a hunting cabin . People hunt animals . For their heads ? Yes . Well , no . Sometimes . Where are you going ? Outside to scout the area . You remain here . Hello . Is anyone there ? Please , is anyone there ? Can you hear me ? This is Deputy Lindsay Reardon . Please . This is an emergency . Anyone , please . Isaac ? Isaac ? It 's me . It 's me . Hello . Yeah . Just send me those coordinates . Okay . We got a VP R lock on Reardon . How ? She tried using a two-way radio . Mr. Beck was using a voice recognition program . He 's triangulated the position . It 's less than 50 miles from here . Kudos Mr. Beck . Come on . Come on . Thank you . Where are you going , Lindsay ? I will drive . You know , I wasn 't gonna leave you back there . Just , just so you know . And you 're welcome , by the way . I 'm welcome . Yeah . You know , I found the car , driving the car . We 're getting away in the car . Kudos . They were here . Yeah . Now they have transportation . One thing doesn 't make sense to me . Why would Issac take this Reardon hostage ? What 's his motive ? We don 't know that she is a hostage . What we do know is that Deputy Reardon 's dispatcher was murdered about the same time we intercepted the phone call from Reardon this morning . Murdered . Yeah , in cold blood . Maybe . You don 't think it was Reardon . Perhaps . Now she 's an accomplice ? I don 't have that information . I don 't know what her agenda is . Either way , someone else has knowledge of Isaac . Makes this a national security matter . It means we have to call the FBI , the NSA . What ? The F ... what ? The FBI ? The FBI and the NSA don 't even know this project exists . You know that as well as I do . But Isaac has been programmed not to reveal anything about his identity . As long as the girl 's with him , she represents the threat , not him . Simon ! A law enforcement officer was killed . Which means there 's an investigation going on already . I 'm sure there is . We are just not gonna be part of it . How do you propose we do this ? As I 've been doing it . With my own people . Mr. Beck . Dr. Hart . What are your orders ? Search the area . Remove any evidence they were here . You heard him . When you finish , burn It down . It 's under control . Not a lot going on around here . Reduces the possibility of recognition . It also reduces the possibility of us eating any time soon . And that noise you hear like it sounds like a muffler , well , it 's my stomach . My blood sugar is in the basement . You really are gonna need to head towards civilization soon . Your points are being considered . Lindsay . That is your name ? Yes . And it would be really nice if you used it every now and then . You make me feel like I 'm spending time with a real life and not a creepy human . It was just a suggestion . Lindsay . What ? I was using your name . It 's a start . Isaac , stop the car . Stop , stop , stop , stop . Stop , please . Isaac , stop the car ! Stop ! Stop the car ! Please . Thank you . Calm down . I 'm a Deputy Sheriff . Tell me what 's going on . We were driving and we had a flat tire . So , I told Katie , " Please , stay in the car . Look after your baby sister . " She said she had to take the dog out because he had to go to the bathroom . I tried to fix it . I went to check on the kids , Katie , she 'd gone with the dog . The dog came back , but Katie didn 't come back . I don 't know where she is ! Katie ! Katie ! Just calm down , okay ? Do you have a cell phone ? Did you call 911 ? Yes , I called them , but I can 't get through . Okay . This is what I want you to do . I want you to go up the road , and see if you can get cell reception . Why are you hiding ? Are you afraid ? Why ? I got lost . But your mother , she 's far from here and she cannot hear you . I can take you to her . Oh , Katie . Oh , sweetie ! What 's your name ? My name is Isaac . Thank you , Isaac . Thank you . We cannot take you with us . We must go . You built a Gollum . What are you talking about ? It 's a creature from Jewish relig ... Yeah , I know what a Gollum is . When you track Issac down . Exactly how do you plan to stop him ? That 's what the boys in black are for . So much for your Gollum . We traced a cell call . From whom ? Someone called 911 about a missing daughter . She called back . Canceled . Asked for a tow truck instead . Said she was helped by a deputy sheriff . A woman deputy sheriff . And guess what ? She was accompanied by a man . 50 miles east of here . Not many towns in the area . I think they 're gonna head north . Our hard work is done here , Mr. Beck . We 'll run parallel to you on highway five . You continue to monitor all calls or radio transmissions . Just let 's get this son of a bitch . Hi . Hey . Coffee , please ? You got it . How about sugar ? Thanks . So , um , what 's good here ? Eggs special won 't kill ya . I 'll have that with hash browns and a Cherry Coke . What about your boyfriend ? Honey , what do you want to eat ? I 'd like page two , Delores . What do you want on page two ? All the items . We 've been , you know , driving all night . Uh-huh . Back in a jiff . Thanks . Mm . Don 't . I 'm going to the little girl 's room . Can you try not to eat things while I 'm gone ? I require food , Lindsay . It 's coming . When ? Soon . Okay ? I got a coat just like that . Let 's push on a little farther . Two-seven to base , come in . Come in , two-seven . Yep . Everything 's okeydokey out here . We 're gonna take five and grab a bite . Roger that , two-seven . That was a slow night . Morning . Yes . Delores , a little service here . I 'm coming . Hold your horses . Sheriff 's office . Ottaway ? Lindsay . I 'm glad you called . I 'm worried about you . I have been trying to get a hold of Larkin . Larkin 's dead . What happened ? There 's a lot of people here that hope you can shed some light on that . What do you mean ? Have you watched the news ? They 're saying you did it . What ? Your gun . They ... We found it here in the office . Matty 's throat was cut , and you shot twice . We 've got the slugs and the brass . You have to believe me . I didn 't kill Matty . Lins , look , I believe you . I 'm not throwing in with those guys . I 've known you a long time . They think they 've got a case against you . This whole thing will be cleared up quick if you surrender yourself to the proper authorities and trust it 'll work itself out . Got you . Lins ? Lins ? Lins ! Yeah . All right . Route 7 . Highway 19 . You gotta get there quick and intercept them before every government agent 50 miles arrives . We 're two minutes behind you . Reardon just called in . They traced it . Come on , Let 's go . Your food is here . I 'm not feeling very well . Let 's go . Hey ! What about the check ? Oh. yeah . You know , if my head wasn 't screwed to my shoulders , I 'd forget that , too . Keep going . Freeze ! Place your weapon on the table . Take it easy there , mister . Do as I say . All right . Morning . Find the freaking key , Don ! Get up ! Get in the car . Wasn 't that your Elky ? The man and the woman are still in there ? They left in his Elky . Give me the 50 . Oh ! Go , go go ! There they are . Lindsay . Yeah . I think I just ... I just banged my head . Isaac . Ram him . I hope he was wearing a seat belt . Isaac , don 't let go . Listen up , people . We 're here in pursuit of an individual , we believe to be Deputy Lindsay Reardon . I have some questions to ask you . No questions . Oh , fuck . Yeah . Yeah , okay . Good . It 's a watershed culvert that drains into three rigs below . We 're gonna have to search all of them . Way this weather 's coming , it 's gonna take us a while . If they 're down there , we will find them . I 'm sure you will , Mr. Beck . Before you do , you have to clean up this mess . The authorities are gonna be here soon . When they get here , we have to be gone . You understand ? Yes , sir . The bad news is I don 't think they 're gonna find them . Which means it 's highly likely they 're still on the run . You 'd like to hear the good news ? The good news is , Isaac is still performing well beyond the expectations . They were men , Simon . Not nameless stats on some report . They were real men . Men with families . You show me the war that ever excluded men with families from the battlefield . This is not your personal crusade . People are in danger . You need to inform the proper authorities of what happened here . What do you think your employers will think of that ? They funded the project . I would think that makes them tacitly responsible as well . As are you , Ms. Fraser . Nice try , Simon . I 'm not playing that game . It 's not a game . I , uh , I need to rest . Did you hear me ? Really , I need to rest . We haven 't heard anything . They retreated . Does that help you ? What ? When you touch that . I like to think it does . Your hand is hot . Are you all right ? My body temperature is high due to my metabolic rate . You 're frigid . Yeah , well , I 'm , uh , I 'm tired . And it 's cold . There is snow on the ground if you haven 't realized . I can keep you warm . It 's better . Just don 't get any ideas , okay ? I do not understand . The story of my life . What ? I , uh , I felt you twitch . They 're coming . Did you sleep ? I have what could be construed as rest periods . Do you dream when you rest ? Sometimes I see images in my head . I mean , like memories ? I do not always recognize the people in them . Isaac . You saved my life . Thank you . Have you always been like this ? Do you know who you are ? That information is classified . But do you know ? You don 't know , do you ? You know , we could actually find out . How ? I do have a little experience in tracing people 's pasts . Let me see your hand . We need to keep moving . Just show me your hand . Uh . Looks like they didn 't want you to know . Your fingerprints , see ? They 've been burned off . You see ? See how I have mine ? Not this one . Let me see . Looks like those healing abilities actually come in handy . You should know who you are , Isaac . Why ? 'Cause a person 's history defines who they are . And this fingerprint will tell us ? It could tell us a lot . Just gotta get out of here first . They were here , but they 're gone now . We 're heading back up . Suit yourself . Something you 'd like to add ? Nope . Come on , let 's go . N ice truck . It comes with a phone . Do you think you can get this thing started ? Yes . All right , get in . Yes , Ms. Fraser . This creation of yours , he might be easier to find if we had some idea where he 's going . I don 't believe he knows . Maybe he went back home . What do you mean by home ? Back to the lab . Well , forgive me , but I think that 's ... it 's highly unlikely . At the end of the day it 's all he really knows . If that was his plan , he could just sit there and wait for an armed escort . He 's made every effort to elude us . Let 's just call it a hunch . I 'm heading back up . There . Yeah , I 'd like to report a sighting on the Deputy Reardon . The one who killed her partner . Yeah . No , I 'm sure it was her . The farmers ' market on route nine . Yeah . She was driving a green Elky . My name ? Mrs. Isaacson . Come on , come on , come on . Let 's go , guys . Come on . Hurry . Hurry . Look at that . Small-town cops . They 're fast , huh ? They 're going . All right . Let 's go around the back . Just one . I got something . Who 's Wesley Hall ? You are . It says you were charged with three counts of first degree murder . When ? Four years ago . Who did I kill ? Who did I kill , Lindsay ? I don 't know . It says you 're dead . I 'm not dead . I know that . Let me close out this file . I know where to go next . My name is Wesley Hall . Sh . He might hear you . But Lindsay , my name is Wesley Hall . And I 'm trying to read this . It says you were killed three years ago trying to escape prison . Can you find out who I killed ? I 'm still looking . Lindsay . Lindsay . I need air . Lindsay . Lindsay . Your name was Wesley Hall . And you killed your wife . You killed your , your two daughters . You murdered your family . You don 't remember , do you ? I have no memories . I have no memories . The facility 's close by . How do you know ? 'Cause that 's the first thing I saw when I escaped . You ran a long way . It 's right there . Lindsay , please . Okay . Listen , I tried . I ran every personal bioprogram we have again and it leads nowhere . We have to find him . That 's why we go back . We find the original tissues . No ! Why no ? They weren 't collected with the intention of creating a new Isaac . But in given time . Time is what he haven 't got . I haven 't got another two years worth of funding to start all of this from scratch . I spent 20 years developing this from nothing but an instinct for the possibilities into the math and the chemistry and that countless clinical trials . The set back after set back . The begging for funding . And I created a new man ! Oh , dear God . They 're Tinkertoys by comparison . And you think I 'm gonna let that be ripped out of my hands the last minute ? So that when he 's found , somebody else can conceal my work like a change in hair color or a change in race and take the credit ? I spent 20 years in the shadows for one thing . Because everything Isaac is , is mine . You lost him , you find him . Isaac ? I kill , Lindsay . It 's what I 've been programmed to do . But I don 't know why I would 've wanted to kill them . This must end . Where are you going ? I must stop it . They 'll kill you . Then I 'll die . Hey ! It doesn 't work like this . Don 't follow me . Yeah , yeah . Just one more variation . All right . Simon ! Yeah . Late for April fools . That 's true . I 'm sorry , I don 't get the joke . I know about Isaac . I know everything . Sit ! Yeah . I got an idea . Why don 't you put the gun down and we can have a proper chat . I 'm fine . Chat away . Okay . But I find it kind of difficult to talk with a weapon in my face . It 's a ... Shut the hell up . Tyler . Don 't even think about it , unless you wanna sip supper through a straw for the rest of your life . So , what do you know about Isaac ? A couple of things . This and that . I prefer to hear them in your own words though . Now . With the test we ran , all his capabilities were flawless . Simulating missions , control circumstances , he performed beyond expectations . He was the definition of a killing machine , but It was simulated . And that wasn 't enough . No . We had to see it with the real thing . So that 's when I decided to use prisoners . We needed to test to see if he would kill on command . He would be executed anyway . Oh , well . Sticky death penalty issues aside . I 'm not a politician . I 'm a scientist . Keep talking . Isaac 's Ideology for whatever reason couldn 't support killing in cold blood . To kill a person that didn 't impose a direct threat or perceived danger put his psyche into a crisis point and he was forced to make a decision . He broke out . Yeah . Let me just ask you something , Ms. Fraser . When the time comes for you to make that life or death decision , do you think you 'll be able to pull that trigger ? I don 't know . It 's your lab . Do you want to test me ? So , let 's talk about Wesley Hall . No . No , just listen to me , okay ? Get them to Grantford right now . So you want me to call in the FBI . No . I want you to turn to the FBI agent who 's standing right next to you and have him call the closest field office and get them here right now . Did you have enough time to trace my phone call or do you need the address again ? No , we 're good . Good . For a scientist , you are stupid . Well , Ms. Fraser , any other brilliant plans ? It 's Isaac . Where ? Uh . He wa ... He was just here ! Switch cameras . Where the hell is he ? You must be Isaac . Leave . I know who you were . I was Wesley Hall . I was a convicted murderer . No , you were a scientist . You were Simon Hart 's partner . God . Why would I 've killed my family ? I don 't know . Maybe Simon . What ? I think maybe he had something to do with it . Leave . Okay , okay , okay . I 'm on your side . Really ? Then why were you following us ? I saw you with them . Oh . Where 's Isaac ? He 's back there . Take me there . You 're making a very big mistake . Deputy Reardon . Oh , shit . If Isaac was paying me a visit , you couldn 't be far behind . You guys come any closer , I 'll blow her brains out . I haven 't seen anybody 's brains blow out in about a day now . I 'm serious . As a heart attack ? You 'll be doing him a favor . I know about Wesley Hall . Lindsay , please . You 're outgunned . I suggest if you wanna see your friend Isaac again , you put the gun down now . Let 's say right now . Simon Hart . N ice to meet you . Hey , soldier , welcome home . Wait ' till you see what I 'm gonna do to you now . I gotta admit , boy . You 're fast . Yes , I am . Isaac ? Isaac ? Isaac ? Lindsay . Hello , Wes . What do you think of our security snare ? Very specific microwave frequency . Throws every nanobot into your system in a complete disarray . Must be terribly painful . Oh , oh , by the way , thank you for your time , Deputy , but I 'll no longer be needing your help . Oh ! God you 're looking well , Wes . Minus a few hundred bullet hits , of course . You always were the sentimental type , weren 't you , Wes ? You wanna go along with me ? When I suggested using inmates for our experiments , you thought they should be volunteers . Volunteers ! You saw how well the volunteer service worked out for the armed forces . Deserters by the hundreds overseas . Public outcry over the deaths of thousands of this country 's best and brightest . Meanwhile , a host of rapists , thugs and killers taking up space behind bars at tax payer 's expense . Prisons full of potential soldiers . They rejected society . They should be the volunteers . But you wanted to save that privilege for yourself ? Started testing the phase one drugs on yourself . You , having no idea I already made extensive contacts within the military industrial complex endorsing my plan . And you found out and it just jeopardized everything . You said you could no longer trust me . Let me tell you , a little lack of trust between business partners is a dangerous thing . You killed my family . No . No . Mr. Beck did . Mr. Beck killed your family . But once you were found guilty of their murders , it did make things go more smoothly . Although you didn 't make it easy to replicate your phase one research . Something about all your files being destroyed . It 's just why I arranged to have you brought back here for phases two through four . Out of professional respect for you , of course . You know what , Wes ? I 'm gonna fry your brain until there 's only enough left to spoon into a test tube . And I 'm gonna scrape up the D NA and the tissue samples , and I 'm gonna build you again . Only this time I 'm gonna do it right . Oh . See ? You 're not the only superhuman here . You all right ? Yeah , I 'll be all right . Thank you , Lindsay Reardon . Kudos . Open up your hand . You gotta bad guy to catch . Okay , hold it . Put your hands on your head . Do as I say . Okay . Look , I 'll do whatever you say . Just get the hell in there . Get on your knees . Get on your knees ! No , not me . In there ! Listen , Isaac ... Isaac , please . Please . Listen . Listen to me . It all ends here . Your programming won 't allow you to self-destruct . You never did understand human nature . Oh , really ? Yes , Simon . You have to be human . Subtitles by LeapinLar

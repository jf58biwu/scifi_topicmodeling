 ( panting ) ( car alarms blaring in distance ) ( woman screaming ) ( grunts ) WOMAN : Over here ! ( groans ) ( car alarms continue blaring ) ( grunts ) ( sobbing ) Please , help me ! Please ! WOMAN : ( screaming ) Someone , please ! Please ! ( man shouting indistinctly ) Demetri ! Demetri ! ( man screaming ) Aah ! Aah ! " No More Good Days " WOMAN AT RADIO : Good morning , Los Angeles . It 's 7 : 00 , and it looks like it 's gonna be another beautiful day . We 're looking at light clouds and highs in the mid 70s today . Keep that umbrella handy because we 've got a chance of sprinkles later ... ( beeps ) ( chuckles ) I hate you , too . ( chuckles ) Mmm . Mm , babe , don 't forget to look at the garage door . It 's acting up again . Already forgotten . Bye . ( laughs ) Just because I 'm a squirrel doesn 't mean I like acorns . ( gasps ) Mmm , smells good . ( cartoon continues indistinctly ) Here you go , my princess . Mmm . ( kisses ) ( metal grinding ) ( gears squeak ) Te ayudo . ( I 'll help ) ( chuckles ) Hey , Hector . Buenos dias . ( Good morning ) ( man ) # And it don 't take much to get ... # Hey , Nicole . - I 'm sorry I 'm late . - Don 't worry . Hey , Olivia 's working the late shift at the hospital tonight . You think you can stay an extra hour or two ? Yeah , no problem . - I 've got studying to do anyway . - You 're a saint . MAN : Hey , this is Bryce . You know what to do . ( beep ) Bryce , it 's Olivia . You weren 't around yesterday . You better have a damn good reason why . Okay , you call me immediately . I 'm worried about you . ( indistinct conversations , seagulls calling ) MAN : My daughter Tracy was 5 ' 5 " , 118 pounds . But ... when the marines shipped her body back from Afghanistan ... Sorry , her remains ... They weighed 37 . Only reason I knew it was her at all was because they DNA 'd what was left . So ... Yeah . I took a drink that night . - You call Amanda yet ? - Yeah , we 're talking . Oh , you 're talking ? Really ? Really , that 's kinda weird because she told Olivia she never heard from you . Hey , I 'm your sponsor . I 'm the one who 's supposed to be riding you , not the other way around . All right , all right . I 'm getting around to it . Come on , Aaron . Just call . She 's cool . - Nurses freak me out , man . - It 's a date . She 's not giving you a friggin ' enema . How do you know that 's not my thing ? ( Mos Def 's " Quiet Dog " playing ) ( Nicole laughs ) # To the rhythm of the boogie to be # # There it go like simple the plainless # # The prominent bassness , Zulu arrangement # # Rockin ' amazement , fly gold # - What 's wrong ? - I thought I heard Charlie . - Charlie 's asleep . - This is so wrong . ( laughs ) Which is why you love it . Dude , as soon as we 're done , you have to get your ass out of here . All right , well , stop talking and get to work . ( camera shutter clicking ) MAN : So then we get to the subject of the first dance , right ? I 'm sorry , but Zoey picks one of the corniest songs of all time- - " Islands in the Stream . " Yeah . The old Kenny Rogers / Dolly Parton duet . Okay , and we used to sing it when we did karaoke , but that was when we were , like , really , really drunk , you know ? And I put up with it because we were dating , and that 's what you do . But my friends are gonna be there , my family . I cannot dance to " Islands in the Stream . " I will never live it down . You don 't care about any of this , do you ? Oh , I do . I do care . I 'm riveted . I 'm fascinated . - # Uh-huh # - ( Demetri laughs ) But , uh , what do you want me to say , don 't marry her ? Don 't marry her . The odds are against you anyway . Oh , that 's good . Thank you . You 're still married . I 'm surprised Olivia didn 't leave me a long time ago . Me , too , buddy . So what 'd you guys dance to ? # Simmer down , I manage your mayhem , I 'm bright as the A.M. # I can 't even remember . # Quiet dog , wild hog , my God # # Huh , simmer down , simmer down , simmer down # # You keep up the rock and you don 't stop the rock # # Maintain the rock and you don 't stop the rock # # You keep up the rock and you don 't stop the rock # He 's a holy terror . - Terrible twos at one year . - Mm . ( chuckles ) You 're lucky you have a girl . Ugh . Are you kidding me ? You only have to worry about one penis . - I gotta worry about all of them . - ( laughs ) Here we go . Showtime . ( camera shutter clicking ) Khalid , Omar , unknown female going mobile in a black S.U.V. Bobby , you 're on point . They should hit you in 20 seconds . ( beep ) FBI . Janis Hawk . It 's Benford . Get Wedeck . - Suspects are on the move . - Three weeks . It 's finally about to start getting interesting . Okay , Mark , I 'm putting you on speaker . What do you got ? Khalid , Omar and an unidentified Caucasian woman . We 're e-mailing you pictures right now . Who is she ? Uh , that 's the " unidentified " part , sweetheart . ( typing on keyboard ) Get this to Digital Forensics and run it by I.C.E. Okay . ( brakes squeal ) They made us . They 're on the move . ( siren wailing ) ( tires screech ) BOTH : Whoa ! Holy ! Ohh !

Black Escalade , license plate 8 , " Queen , " " Robin , " 7-2-2 , " Young . " We need L.A.P.D. and air support now ! ( horn blares ) No ! - Drop ! Car ! - Calm down ! Car ! - Shut up ! - No ! No ! ( laughs ) What are you laughing at ? I don 't know . I 've never done this before . ( tires screeching ) ( brakes squealing ) Come on . ( shouts indistinctly ) ( tires screech ) Aah ! ( whoosh ) ( whoosh ) ( whispering indistinctly ) ( cocks gun ) ( panting ) ( car alarms blaring in distance ) ( woman screaming ) ( man shouting indistinctly ) MAN : We need help ! - ( woman continues screaming ) - ( grunts ) ( groans ) ( sobbing ) Please help me ! ( people screaming ) ( gasps ) ( surf rolling , seagulls calling ) ( alarm beeping rapidly ) WOMAN : Dr. Benford , what happened ? I don 't know . I lost consciousness . - You okay ? - Yeah . MAN : Nicole ? ( car alarms blaring in distance ) ( groans ) What happened ? I-I blacked out . ( birds chirping ) Help ! - ( woman screaming ) - Demetri ! Demetri ! ( dog barks ) ( screaming continues ) ( shouting in Asian language ) Calm down . Relax , man . - Okay . Try to calm down . - ( continues shouting ) Aah ! Aah ! ( loud explosion ) ( glass shattering ) ( loud whoosh ) WOMAN : Aah ! ( loud crash ) ( screaming continues ) MAN : Aah ! Look out ! Aah ! ( loud explosion ) ( people screaming ) ( loud explosion ) ( woman screaming ) Mark ! Over here ! - Hey ! - Hey ! MARK : Are you all right ? Yeah . Yeah , I think so . We were driving , right ? - I blacked out . - Me , too . WOMAN : Help me ! - All right , all right , move aside . - Sorry . - Move aside . - Excuse me . MARK : Stay calm . We got you . DEMETRI : Yeah , got him . Get back ! This thing could blow . All right , we gotta call this in ! We gotta call 9-1-1 . Trust me , they know . Try the office . See if they can tell us what the hell happened . ( loud explosion ) ( people screaming ) ( loud crash ) MAN ( in distance ) : ... the water ! Somebody ! They 're not moving ! Help ! Hey ! Hey ! Help ! Please ! Help ! I-I need some help ! Please , somebody ! Help ! Hey ! Help ! Just hold on ! I 'm a doctor ! I 'll be right there ! Oh , crap . Charlie ! Charlie ! ( exhales deeply ) Sweetheart , are you okay ? I had a bad dream . I dreamt there were no more good days . ( people shouting indistinctly ) ( beep ) Can 't get my family . That 's our S.U.V. That 's what I was thinkin ' . MAN : Help me ! Can you hear me ? ! ( man shouts indistinctly ) Hey , go this way ! - Get up and move it around ! - ( woman sobbing ) Hands up ! Hands up ! I got her . Get out . Come on . - Get out . Get out ! - ( woman groans ) We know you were planning an attack . - What did you do , huh ? - ( groans ) Uhh ! Tell me what happened ! Take it easy . We know about the suitcase . Did you set it off ? Answer me ! ( panting ) I blacked out . I was somewhere else . There was a storm . The horses were scared . What are you talking about ? What are you talking about ? - What are you talking- - - Calm down ! Does this look like a dirty bomb to you ? Does it ? We don 't know what this is . - Maybe they weren 't even involved . - Are--are you guys cops ? FBI . It 's okay . - What happened ? WOMAN : Was it a nuclear attack ? I don 't know . It 's gotta be the big one . I mean , look . Look at this mess . It 's gotta be . When 's help getting here ? Look , until emergency services arrive , we need to stay calm and help whoever we can , all right ? They ain 't comin ' . - What ? DEMETRI : What 'd you say ? I just heard on my radio , some guy in San Diego . They 're dealing with the same thing . It 's more than just L.A. , man . Sit down . You move , I shoot . ( man shouting indistinctly ) ( beeping ) I can 't get through to Zoey . What about Olivia ? - No . - Listen , Zoey 's in Seattle right now . But Olivia 's close by , right ? Hospital 's 2 miles . You can make it on foot . No , no , I-I-I can 't just leave- - There 's nothing we can do here right now . Okay ? Go check on your family . Go ! ( sirens continue wailing ) ( man shouting indistinctly ) ( electricity crackles ) ( woman screams ) Help me ! ( alarm bell ringing ) ( people shouting indistinctly ) MAN : Look out ! Move ! Aah ! - ( tires screech ) - Watch out ! Look out , man ! Hey ! Son of a ... ( indistinct police radio chatter ) ( helicopters whirring overhead ) ( siren wailing ) MAN : Roger . MAN : Come on , man , get out ! ( man on TV speaking indistinctly ) WOMAN : There are thousands and thousands of injured people waiting for emergency ... WOMAN IN BRITISH ACCENT : Uh , all we know for certain is that everyone on the planet seemed to have blacked out at exactly the same time . MAN : ... Confirming that the blackout was a worldwide phenomenon . Officials are ... WOMAN : Fire services and police services are completely overwhelmed at this time . MAN : ... En este momento . ( At this time ) My God . It 's the whole world . WOMAN : ... Information as to the cause of the blackout . WOMAN : Hospitals are overflowing . Fire services ... and police services are completely overwhelmed ... Livy ! Livy , I 'm here . Oh , thank God ! - I got ahold of you . - What about Charlie ? Is she okay ? She 's fine . Nicole called . She can stay put till one of us gets home . And you 're all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . We were in the middle of surgery and we all lost consciousness . Everyone . Patient died while we were out . I 'm downtown right now . Same thing . So , uh , w-what ? Everyone there blacked out ? Yeah , everyone . We thought it was just the hospital , but then Corrie got a call from her mother in Chicago . Same thing happened there . I know . It looks like this thing is global . Global ? That 's impossible . Oh , I-I love you , but , babe , I gotta go . ( beep ) - All right , I love you . Livy ? - ( siren wailing ) - What do you got ? - Got an 8-year-old boy . Pede versus car , plowed straight through a fence at an elementary school . Head injury on the right , - abdominal bruising on the left . - Dr. Benford ! Bryce , where the hell have you been ? Go get into your scrubs . Meet me in E.R. Okay , let 's get him into trauma . - You 're gonna be okay , honey . - I know , Olivia . How did you know my name ? ( monitor beeping steadily ) What have we heard from Washington ? We 're the same . Everyone 's just gathering intel . CIA , Homeland Security . Our various legats offices overseas . In other words , nobody knows anything . How 's he doing ? BRYCE : He 's taking a turn for the worse . ( monitor beeping steadily ) - ( boy gasping ) - I got no breath sounds on the left , possible punctured lung . He needs a left chest tube stat . - ( monitor beeping rapidly ) - We don 't release the pressure soon , - it 's gonna stop his heart from beating . - He 's going south . Sats are dropping . - What the hell is this ? - Worldwide phenomenon . Near as we can tell . People from all corners losing consciousness - at exactly the same moment . - And for the same duration- - 2 minutes , 17 seconds . How is that even possible ? Where the hell is that chest tube tray ? I need it now ! BRYCE : We got no pulse . - Blood pressure 's 40 . - Thoracotomy . - What are we gonna do ? OLIVIA : Come on , sweetie . - Hang in there . - Pulse ox 90 . Pulse ox 80 . We 're dropping ! - We 're losing him ! No pulse . - How are we doing ? No pulse . Blood pressure 's dropping . So we 've eliminated nuclear launches , EMPs , - and chemical agents . - What about natural phenomena then ? NASA 's checking into more exotic explanations- - Solar flares , gamma bursts , that kind of thing . But so far they 've come up empty . What about the Vatican ? Has the Pope chimed in yet ? ( monitor beeping rapidly ) OLIVIA : Let 's get this chest tube in . Sats improving , B.P. ' s normalizing . ( monitor beeping steadily ) WOMAN : Pleur-evac . ( chest tube sucking ) Doing great , buddy . Doing real good . Okay , let 's get him into the C.T. scanner , check out that head injury . Bryce , you close him up . Nice job . But don 't think you 're off the hook . I still wanna know where you were yesterday . ( monitor continues beeping steadily ) WOMAN : Yeah , clean that up . We need to wrap our heads around the scope of this thing , people . It 's now been four hours since the blackout . You shut off the consciousness of the entire human race for two minutes . What would the death toll be ? How many cars collided ? We have planes down at L.A.X. How many more across the country ? Around the world ? MAN : F.A.A. ' s reporting 877 aircraft down in the United States alone . Air Force Two was one of ' em . The veep was on board . Okay . What about hospitals ? Operations ? Births that were in process . People probably died walking up a flight of stairs . ( indistinct whispering ) MAN : Global projections are pretty staggering . What about the blackouts themselves , sir ? What about them ? Well , we 've been saying people have been blacking out , but ... that wasn 't my experience . For me , it was ... more like a dream , only more vivid than that . One second , I was in a car . The next ... I was somewhere else . Yeah , the same thing happened to me . Me , too . During the blackout , people seem to have experienced some kind of ... hallucination . No . No , no . Except that mine didn 't feel like a hallucination . - What 's your point , Benford ? - I didn 't just lose consciousness . It felt more like my ... consciousness went somewhere else . Like I was having a memory , only it--it wasn 't of the past . It was of the future . I was in my office . It was night . It was 10 : 00 on the hour . I was looking out into the atrium , and I happened to see the date- - April 29 , 2010 , about half a year from now . Hold on . April 29th ? I saw the same date . It was on the news . Same for me- - April 29th , 10 : 00 P.M. So you 're saying what , everyone 's consciousness just jumped forward six months to ... April 29th ? Crazy as that sounds , yeah . ( indistinct conversations ) Sit down . Sit down ! J.T. , could you , uh , give me a hand ? Thanks . We didn 't do this . Even if you didn 't , you were still planning on killing thousands of people . So stay still ... and shut up . - Hey . - Hey . - You get ahold of Zoey ? - Yeah , she 's all right . - Mark , hey . You got a sec ? - Sure . I think there may be a way to corroborate what we were talking about in there . What do you mean ? Well , in my ... flash-forward , it was April 30th , 6 : 00 A.M. , but I was in London , which is eight hours ahead of the west coast , so it makes sense . Wait , " flash-forward " ? What are we talking about here ? I 'll explain later . Tell me what you saw . I was having a meeting with our liaison at New Scotland Yard . ( indistinct conversations ) I remember we were interrupted because ... this bird just crashed into the window . The point is , I had a vision of Fiona Banks . Let 's see if she had a vision of me . Inspector Banks . Fiona , this is Al Gough , FBI . I 'm here with my colleagues in L.A. My God . Uh , I know why you 're calling . You want to know what I saw . - We all do . - Okay . Um ... We were sitting in my office . - What was the date ? - April 30th . What time ? Uh , I don 't know . Uh , 6 : 00 in the morning . Don 't ask me why it was so early . Something to do with the Rutherford case . Yes ! Yes , and--and something interrupted us . Yes . Uh , uh , a bird . It flew at the window . It broke its neck . So our visions were the same . When the worldwide blackout occurred earlier today , people were undergoing brain scans at that exact moment . MAN : So like MRIs or PET scans ? That kind of thing ? Exactly . And in each of these cases , the hippocampus , that 's the memory center of the brain , was actively engaged for the entire 2 minutes and 17 seconds . These thought patterns are consistent with a waking experience . People were not asleep . They were not dreaming . So then what is it that they were experiencing ? - ( crying softly ) - Well , by all appearances , uh , memories of events that haven 't occurred yet . So everyone saw the future . But did they see the same future ? I mean , are these accounts consistent ? Well , they certainly seem to be . Hundreds of thousands of people were watching news broadcasts , reading newspapers , and their details seem to be the same- - Senator Glenway will be facing ethics charges . the Dow will be on an upswing . There 'll be food riots in Ghana - and the list goes on . - ( cell phone vibrating ) A remarkably concise series of events are starting to come together from that day . It 's like a grand mosaic is being filled in . Everyone on earth ... Mosaic . That was the name of the investigation I was working on in my vision . It had to do with what caused all this . So did you see anything in your vision that was helpful ? Photographs , names , people of interest . If this really was the future we all saw , then I guess maybe they will be leads , but none of them make any sense to me right now . Anything else ? - No . No , that--that was it . - What about you ? What did you see ? Nothing . I , uh , I blacked out like everybody else and woke up on the road . What about our , uh , person of interest ? - Do we think she 's involved ? MARK : She 's a dead end , if you ask me , - and clueless as the rest of us . WEDECK : Well , circle back on it anyway . We 're grasping at straws at this point . Janis , you wanna share what you saw ? Yeah , I was ... ( chuckles ) getting a prenatal sonogram . The baby was about 17 weeks , and it was a little girl . It was totally bizarre . But I 'm obviously not pregnant . I don 't even have a boyfriend . What about you , sir ? I ... was in a meeting . A meeting ... ( whistling ) And I happened to glance down at the paper . Sports page . The Rays rallied from 3 runs down to sweep the Sox at Fenway . And there was another story . Kobe Bryant tore his ligament in his knee . Out for the season . ( toilet flushes ) You know what ? We should start writing these stories down . JANIS : Yeah . - I mean , the " Post " has a circulation of what , a million ? A million , yeah . How many other people were reading it then , too ? We gotta start comparing stories . Yeah , it 's not just the " Post . " It 's all the other news outlets . 7 billion people caught a glimpse of the future . Maybe just one of them knows why this happened . How do we compare 7 billion stories ? - You create a web site . MARK : Right . People can log on and post what they saw and cross-reference their visions . We can piggyback on that and search for patterns . I think that 's what I was already doing . WEDECK : What do you mean ? MARK : Mosaic . All those leads I was running down . We should start following up on ' em now . Assuming your vision is even accurate , the investigation doesn 't exist yet . But it could . It will . In my flash-forward , I was investigating what caused all this . I seemed to have an idea why all of this was happening . And those people , the places I saw on the board- - They were part of this puzzle- - Mosaic . Look , I 'm certain of it . Fine . We 'll set up interagency task force . And as far as this office is concerned , - you three , you own this . - This is kind of insane . I mean , we 're running point on this because he had a vision of us running point on this ? MARK : What , you- - You find that funny ? DEMETRI : We don 't even know- - MARK : Come on . It 's the only lead we have . - We don 't have anything right now . - It works . It works for me . It works for me ! The whole world 's on pins and needles , people . Air traffic 's been grounded . People scared to leave their homes , walk across the street . Hell , we 've got martial law across half this country . Priority number one- - Finding out what caused this . Priority number two is figuring out whether or not it 'll happen again . You got it ? ALL : Yes , sir . Good . I 'm out . Okay , my psychic friend , what do you got ? I remember a name- - D. Gibbons . DEMETRI : Gibbons . MARK : That 's right . Yeah . What else you got ? There was a photograph here of a doll . The doll was burned . The head was melted . There was a-a bullet casing nearby . Something about Baltimore . A hand . Baltimore ... No . No , no , wait . Wait , wait , wait , wait . A ... A " blue hand . " - That 's what it said . - What the hell does that mean ? I have no idea . Just put it up . No , no , no . Wait , wait , wait . Here , in the center . This is gonna sound stupid , but I was wearing one of those , uh ... friendship bracelets . - You know , like kids make . - Yeah . - Okay , that 's good . What else ? - What else ? That 's it . Those are all the leads I can remember . What about your state of mind ? What were you doing ? ( sighs ) I was ... chambering a round . I was scared to death . You were scared to death in here ? Yeah . The office was empty , but ... Someone was coming for me . They were wearing masks . They wanted to kill me because of what I knew . One of ' em had a ... tattoo . How many D. Gibbons do you think there are in the world ? Maybe thousands . Have Janis compile a list . ( sighs ) Not a hell of a lot to go on yet . At least you remember something . What do you mean ? Everybody saw something . Everybody had some kind of a vision . I didn 't see a damn thing , Mark . Maybe it means you 'll be sleeping six months from now . If I was sleeping , why wasn 't I dreaming ? Look , I never remember my dreams . Stop , all right ? We 're both thinking the same thing , so let 's just say it . What if I didn 't see anything because six months from now ... I 'm gonna be dead ? - ( crickets chirping ) - Mr. Benford ? Are you all right ? Yeah . How 's Charlie ? She 's fine . She 's sleeping . I was watching the news all day . They say it happened everywhere . It 's gonna be okay . Is that what they 're saying at the FBI ? Do you have inside information ? I wish we did . So then you don 't know it 's gonna be okay . I think God did this . Why ? To punish us . OLIVIA : Still no luck finding his parents ? Well , his mother died on the 405 . Father 's name is Lloyd Simcoe . He works at Stanford . But , uh , no one 's been able to locate him yet . ( whispers ) Yeah . ( normal voice ) So even if the kid pulls through , he could still wind up an orphan . Hey , you saved his life today . You chalk that up as a victory . Yeah , I 'm trying , but after a day like today ... What about you ? How are you staying so zen through all this ? Who says I am ? You wanna know why I wasn 't at work yesterday ? Mm-hmm . I 've been going through some really heavy things recently . I don 't want to get into it now . But the--the point is ... This morning , I was out on the Venice Pier , and ... And I was thinking about committing suicide . Oh , my God ! It 's okay . I 'm--I 'm okay . I saw a glimpse of my future , and ... I was alive . You know , and everything 's changed for me now . Whatever I was thinking about doing obviously wasn 't meant to happen . It--it 's like a sign from God or something . You know , these visions were a gift . Don 't you think ? A gift ? I don 't know . Not for me . Why ? What- - What did you see ? I saw the end of my marriage . I was drinking again , in my flash-forward . And in my head , I ... I know it wasn 't just a one-time thing . I was full-fledged drinking again . All the anxiety , shame . ( whispers ) It was all back . Just because you saw that doesn 't mean it 's gonna happen . Even if this future stuff is real , maybe it 's a blessing in disguise . Maybe because you saw it , you can change it . Ghost of Christmas future crap . What if I can 't ? People relapse . I did . You pick yourself up again . Olivia said she 'd- - She 'd leave me if I slip again . - She made that clear . - Then don 't slip . Until you see something that corroborates these visions , it--it 's all fantasy . The future is still up in the air . You 're a terrible sponsor . You know that ? What do you want me to say , Mark ? You 're not the only one this- - this has happened to , you know ? I 've got the opposite problem . What do you mean ? Tracy was killed in Afghanistan . - And you were at the funeral , right ? - Right . But in my flash-forward , she 's alive . ( explosion in distance ) MARK : Doesn 't make any sense . They I.D. ' d her remains . I know . I can 't explain it , but ... It was her . I 'm--I 'm certain of it . And if she 's out there somewhere , she needs me . For two years , I 've- - I 've been putting her to rest . Now ... I don 't know what to think . I-I 'm--I 'm confused . I 'm ... hopeful . And I 'm angry that I 'm hopeful . ( sighs ) You 're worried ... your future 's gonna come true . I 'm worried mine won 't . ( Mojave 3 's " All Your Tears " playing ) ( garage door whirring ) You fixed the garage door . It was a slow day . # Where 's the magic that you wear ? # # That keeps you safe and keeps you feeling free # # Whose arms have held you # # that you don 't know who you are anymore # Do you remember our song ? What ? The one we danced to at our wedding . Etta James . " At Last . " ( chuckles ) Right . What did you see ? ( sighs ) I was at the office , working on a case . It was--it was this- - What caused the flash-forwards . I got the sense I was in danger . Then ... Then it ended . Nothing else ? No , that was it . What about you ? Babe ? I don 't want to talk about it . Why ? 'Cause it was too upsetting . I need to hear it , whatever it was . No . No , you don 't . ( whispers ) Come on . What did you see ? You know what ? Just ... let it go . ( normal voice ) Olivia , what did you see ? ( crying ) I was with another man . ( whispers ) Who ? I don 't know . I 've never seen him before . He was downstairs . I don 't know who he was , and yet my vision- - I had all these intense ... ( cries ) feelings for him . I ... ( voice echoes ) Hey , honey . I don 't understand , Mark . I would never cheat on you . I wouldn 't betray you . I wouldn 't--I ... Just because we saw these things doesn 't mean they 're gonna happen . Dylan ! Uh , I 'm sorry . You are ... ( British accent ) His father Lloyd Simcoe . - How is he ? - He 'll be fine . His attending physician , Dr. Benford , will be here in the morning . She can fill you in on some of the details . Then I 'll wait for her . ( whispering ) Daddy ? What are you doing up , sweetie ? It 's after midnight . I had a bad dream . Come here . You wanna talk about it ? ( normal voice ) Why was Mommy crying ? Oh , she was just scared . It 's gonna be okay . Are you scared ? No , honey . I 'm fine . What do you have there ? What do you got in your hand ? - Hmm ? - Something I made for you . I want you to have it . Take it , Daddy . Do you want me to help you put it on ? Sure . Okay . There you go . I 'm still at work , babe . - # Islands in the stream # - Mm , they got us working late . - # That is what we are # - Yeah , I 'm watching it right now . - # No one in between , # How can we be wrong ? # - # Sail away with me # - If , uh , this is the song you want , - You got it , baby . - # To another world # # And we rely on each other , uh-huh # # From one lover # - # to another , uh-huh # - Let 's , um , let 's talk about the future when you get home . Dem , come here . You have to see this . - # That is what we are # - Gotta go . # No one in between # I love you , too . What 's up ? Okay , so as far as we know , every single person on the entire planet lost consciousness at the exact same period of time , right ? - Right . - Okay , so I started cycling through a bunch of surveillance cameras for the last five hours ... - because I was curious to see - ( hits key ) what they recorded . I looked at hundreds of ' em . I checked every major city , even web cams in other countries ... and they all show the exact same thing . At 11 : 00 A.M. , people start dropping like flies . Okay , and then 2 minutes and 17 seconds later , they start to come to . And then I saw this . ( hits key ) This was in Detroit . - What am I looking at here ? - Just hang on a second . ( hits keys ) Right there . Look right there . - No way . - Yeah . Who the hell is that ? And why are they awake ? ( hits key )

Back you go , that 's it , back you go . What 's going on ? What 's happening ? Buggered if I know . It 's orders from above . But the body 's still in there though , isn 't it ? We can 't just leave it . Move back , they said , clear the site . Special access , they said . For who ? Torchwood . Who 's Torchwood ? Special ops or something . Is that hot ? Er , yeah . They 're not allowed in , they could contaminate the evidence . How come ... ? Don 't ask me , there 's no procedure any more . It 's a fucking disgrace . There you go . I can taste it . Oestrogen , definitely oestrogen . You take the Pill , flush it away , it enters the water cycle , feminises the fish , goes all the way up into the sky , then falls all the way back down on to me . Contraceptives in the rain . Love this planet . Still , at least I won 't get pregnant . Never doing that again . How 's it going ? Nothing yet . It 's got to connect , I 've just got to feel it . Hurry up ! I 'm freezing my arse off . I can 't just flick a switch , it 's more like it grants me access . Whatever that means . It 's like ... Oh , oh , oh ! Positions . If I get punched again , I 'm punching it right back . Just , concentrate . Suzie ? There was ... What was ? I was .. Oh , my God , I was going home . Listen to me , we 've only got two minutes so it 's important that you listen , OK ? Who are you ? Trust me . You 're dead . How am I dead ? You were stabbed . I 'm not dead , I can see you . We 've brought you back but we haven 't got long , I 'm sorry but you 've got to concentrate , who did this to you ? What did you see ? Why am I dead ? Who attacked you ? I don 't want to be dead . Sixty seconds . You 've got to think , just focus on me . What was the last thing you saw ? I didn 't see ... I don 't know . Who killed you , did you see them ? I don 't know . There was ... something behind me . Police said one stab wound in the back . So you didn 't see anything ? No . What happens now ? Thirty seconds . But he didn 't see anyone . Don 't waste it . What else do I say ? What 's your name ? John . John Tucker . OK , John . Not long now . Who are you ? Captain Jack Harkness . Tell me ... what was it like when you died ? What did you see ? John . Tell me what you saw . Ten seconds . Nothing . I saw nothing . Oh , my God . There 's nothing . Shit . I said it was stupid , telling him he was dead . Well , you try it . " Trust me " , like that 's gonna work . Told the last corpse he was injured , he wasted the whole two minutes screaming for an ambulance . Maybe there 's no right way of doing it . What do you think ? You still up ? In here . They said on the news , murder in the city centre , were you there ? No , I dunno , nothing to do with me . How come you 're still up though ? Banana Boat came round . He was saying he 's got plans , he 's off again next summer . How come you 're not pissed then ? No , we had a cup of tea . He 's read this thing about diabetes . Me and him having tea , that 's middle age , that is . There 's some Chinese in the fridge . No , I 'm knackered . You coming to bed ? I 'll just finish here . This man 's found his sister . I 'll see you in a minute . Von , can you do a search for me ? Oh , join the queue . It 's a Captain Jack Harkness . Could you check him out ? I 'm busy . There 's proper channels , Gwen . What sort of Captain ? Don 't know . Just Captain . If I 've got time . Thanks ! If ! Sarah Pallister , 72 , murdered in her front room . Rani Ghosh , 45 , murdered in Robintree Alley . And now John Tucker , 19 , murdered in Llangyfelach Lane . So far , there 's absolutely nothing linking these three victims , apart from the way they died . As far as we can tell , all with the same weapon . A blade , approximately eight inches long , three inches deep . The women were stabbed from the front , but Tucker from behind . What does that tell us about the killer ? That he 's a coward . But those people last night , the people in the car , who were they ? What 's Torchwood ? Dunno , special ops . Yeah , but what does that mean ? Bet you ten quid they 're DNA specialists , it 's all DNA these days , like that CSI bollocks . CSI Cardiff , I 'd like to see that . They 'd be measuring the velocity of a kebab . Thank you ( ! ) Break it up ! DOOR SLAMS Excuse me . It 's all sealed off up there . Who did that ? Thought it was you lot . But what 's it for , what 's happened ? 9am , it was all sealed off , they never said . Chemicals or something . Hello ? Sorry , I 'm just looking for someone . Right , yeah . Clever . Anyway , I don 't know if you saw a man come through here - a tall man , in one of those big sort of military coats . OK . If you could answer ? This is official business . You all right ? That 's good . That 's a good mask sort of thing . Look , I 'm sorry if I 'm interrupting something , but ... I think we can stop this now , OK ? It 's all very well playing silly buggers , but I 'm busy , all right ? Now , I 'm looking for a man in a big grey coat . I said we can stop being silly . Ah , there you are , I did ask when I saw Dr Mahib cos I thought it was him who said about the police , but he said no , then I said about the chemicals but he said don 't be stupid , what chemicals ? So I don 't know , could be anything , who 've you got with you there then ? So much for sealing it off . Ooh , there 's a face ! Nice one . Hey , I tell you mate , you should try plastic surgery . Not on the NHS mind ! You all right ? Yeah . Bloody hell , that is brilliant . That 's like , em , Hellraiser . That 's first class , that is . Look at that , it 's just like real teeth . Go ! Go ! Go ! CAR ENGINE REVS Registration - Charlie Foxtrot Zero Six Foxtrot Delta Uniform . Charlie Foxtrot Zero Six Foxtrot Delta Uniform . Hold on . I think Yvonne wants a word . No sign of a Captain Jack Harkness . Did you search outside Cardiff ? No , that never occurred to me ( ! ) Of course I did . I went nationwide . There 's about 15 Jacks and Johns with that surname , none of them 's a captain . He could 've made it up . The only Captain Jack Harkness on record was American . That 's it , he 's American ! Which you forgot to tell me . So who is he ? American volunteer , Royal Air Force , 133 Squadron . Except he disappeared . Vanished off the records . Presumed dead . When was that ? 1941 . At the height of the Blitz . On the morning of January 21 1941 , Captain Jack Harkness failed to report for duty , never seen again , till now . What 's going on , Gwen , you seeing ghosts ? You lot ! Oi ! Torchwood ! You can 't leave that there . Police . I can see that , love , and you 're still not leaving it there . I 'm talking to you . Excuse me ! Move your bloody car ... Did you get anything on that registration ? No such number . What does that mean ? Doesn 't exist . Double checked with Swansea , triple-checked , there 's nothing , no such vehicle . But Temple 's been asking about you , Gwen . Are you in trouble ? I have walked . I have bloody walked . They were here , and then they were gone . And look , there 's nowhere to hide . They just disappeared . Temple 's not just livid , he 's doing his nut . There was a man , I 'm telling you , there was this porter , he was in a porter 's uniform , and he was killed , or at least he was injured , he must 've been injured , right in front of me , this man in a mask , sort of lashed out , and ... And I 've told you , all hospital staff , present and correct . I saw it . That 's it ? Gwen , sweetheart , think about it , what sort of story is that ? You 're not well . Come with me . I 'll take you home . They were here . Come on . Look at me ! Hot pot ! Or , as the French call it , ho po . Oh , I should 've phoned . I 've got to work . You should be off sick . I know , but they were short and there 's a match on tonight , so I said I 'd take another shift . I 'm sorry . Forgive me . Go on , forgive me . Say you forgive me , you do , don 't you ? OK I got to go . Excuse me , Gwen Cooper , CID . I 'm making some enquiries round the Bay . I need to check some people out on your list , if that 's OK . I don 't suppose you deliver to a Captain Jack Harkness ? I dunno . Well , could you have a look ? Nope . He 's not a regular anyway . J Harkness ? Or just Harkness ? No . OK . Never mind . Thanks anyway . I don 't suppose you 've got a Torchwood ? Oh , aye , we do them all the time . They 're good customers . Oh , hiya . Sorry I 'm late . Someone ordered pizza . Who 's it for ? I think it 's a ... Mr Harkness . Don 't keep them waiting . SHE LAUGHS I can 't do this , I 'm sorry . I 'm rubbish . I give up ! He set me off . Well , that lasted nought point two seconds . She 's actually carrying pizza ! Come on ! She was gonna say , " Here 's your pizza , " and I was going to say , " How much ? " and she says , " Oh , whatever , twenty quid , " and I say , " Oh , I don 't have any money . " I was working on a punchline . I 'd have got there . But it would 've been good ! There 's your pizza . I 'd better go . We 've gone past that stage . You must 've been freezing out there . How long were you walking around ? Three hours ? You could see me ? And before we go any further , who the hell orders pizza under the name of Torchwood ? Me . I 'm sorry . I 'm a twat . That man , at the hospital , that porter , what happened to him ? That was real , wasn 't it ? He was attacked . He 's dead . But there 's no-one gone missing . We took the body , changed the work rota , planted a false witness who saw him leaving the hospital , giving him an alibi for the next 48 hours , so when his body 's pulled out of the docks next Tuesday night , he 's only been missing for three days . He was murdered ? Yes . And you covered it up ? That 's my job . And that other man , John Tucker ? Last night in the alleyway , I saw you . And what did you see ? You revived him . No . What did you see ? You resuscitated him . No , what did you see ? You brought him back to life . Yeah . Who are you ? Torchwood . What 's Torchwood ? This is Torchwood . All around you . And what happens to me ? I 'm police . Constable Gwen Cooper . You can 't do anything . Right then , PC Cooper ... .. d 'you want to come see ? See what ? You saw the murder . Come and see the murderer . Go with him . What is Torchwood ? Who are you ? What is this place ? SCREECHING What was that ? Pterodactyl . Are you coming ? It 's all right - it 's safe , it 's sedated . It 's called a Weevil . Or at least , we call them Weevils . We don 't know their real name , cos they 're not too good at communicating . But we 've got a couple of hundred of them in the city living in the sewers , feeding off the ... Well , it 's the sewers , you can guess . But every once in a while , one of them goes rogue , comes to the surface , attacks . Actually , it 's been happening more and more and we have no idea why . But it 's alien . Look into its eyes . There you go . Take your time . It was born on a different world and it 's real . Owen Harper , Gwen Cooper . " Doctor " Owen Harper , thank you . Toshiko Sato , Suzie Costello , she 's second-in-command . And this is Ianto Jones , Ianto cleans up after us and gets us everywhere on time . I try my best . And he looks good in a suit . Careful , that 's harassment , sir . Why are you telling me their names ? I 'm not supposed to know , am I ? This is classified , isn 't it ? Way beyond classified . Then you shouldn 't be telling me . What are you gonna do to me ? What d 'you imagine ? Well , I 've seen too much . Your names and everything , and the Weevil , and ... You can dump a man in the water and lie about his death . OK ! Tosh , finish that calibration tomorrow morning . Owen , first thing , get a hold of Chandler and Bell , cos I think they 're lying . Ianto , if he needs back-up , then you 'd better be on stand-by . Suzie , I know it 's a pain in the ass , but I need the costing on the glove research , and you 're coming with me . I 'm getting tired of following you . No you 're not , and you never will . Stand on here . C 'mon , next to me . Good night ! Now , you came in through the front door . Let 's take the scenic route . But they can see the lift . Why aren 't they ... ? We 're right out in the open . They can see everything ! Do they look like they can see us ? No , but ... Look at us ! We couldn 't be any more public ! Hello ! Hey , you there , hello ! It 's called a perception filter . He can sort of see us , but we don 't quite register . Just like something in the corner of your eye . It only works on this exact spot . Step off ... Hi ! Nice night ! And lo , we are perceived . How does it work ? No idea . We know how to use it , not how it happens . But if I were to guess , I 'd say that there was once a dimensionally transcendental chameleon-circuit placed right on this spot which welded its perception properties to a spatio-temporal rift . But that sounds kind of ridiculous . " Invisible lift " has got more of a ring to it . But if no-one can see it when the lift 's coming up , there 's a bloody big hole in the floor , don 't people fall in ? That is so Welsh . What is ? I show you something fantastic - you find fault . I just don 't understand ... I tell you what I don 't understand . You 're gonna rattle on with that , " How can this be true ? " What 's it gonna take for you people ? If you want evidence of aliens , how about that great spaceship hovering over London on Christmas Day ? What about the battle of Canary Wharf ? A Cyberman in every home ! My boyfriend says it 's like a sort of terrorism . Like they put drugs in the water supplies - psychotropic drugs , causing mass hallucinations and stuff . Yeah , well your boyfriend 's stupid . Oh , you 've met him ? So ... you catch aliens ? Yup . You catch aliens for a living ? Yes , we do . You 're an alien-catcher ? Yes , I am . Caught any good aliens ? Tons of ' em ! That 's hell of a job . Sure is . This is so weird . And who are you , then ? Captain Jack Harkness . I did some research and there 's only one Captain Jack Harkness on record . And he disappeared in 1941 . Well ... that couldn 't be me ... could it ? We don 't just catch aliens . We scavenge the stuff they leave behind . Find ways of using it . Arming the human race for the future . The twenty-first century is when it all changes , and you 've got to be ready . But who 's in charge of you ? We 're separate from the government . Outside the police . Beyond the United Nations . Cos if one power got hold of this stuff , they could use it for their own purposes . But so could you . All alien technology stays on the base . No-one 's allowed to take anything outside . So go on , then . How the hell did you end up in Cardiff ? This is Torchwood Three . Torchwood One was London , destroyed in the battle . Torchwood Two is an office in Glasgow , very strange man . Torchwood three , Cardiff . Torchwood Four 's kinda gone missing , but we 'll find it one day . So you just fancied Cardiff ? There 's a rift in space and time running right through the city . The Weevils didn 't come in a spaceship . They just slip through . All sorts of things get washed up here . Creatures , timeshifts , space junk , debris , flotsam and jetsam . Sounds like Cardiff , yeah . Hey , don 't knock it , I 'm a citizen . But where are you from ? All sorts of places . Thing is , we could liaise on this ... the serial killer . I could be like your liaison with the police . Right , I can see the mistake . You think because we showed up we 're out to catch the killer . Sorry . Nothing to do with us . Then what were you doing there ? Testing the glove . We need murder victims , simple as that . The glove only works on the recently deceased , and the more violent the trauma , the stronger the resurrection . All we need is fresh meat . No , you were asking that man , John Tucker , I saw you , you were asking him about his killer . He 'd just been murdered , what else are you gonna ask ? You could get an ID . You could help . We 're busy . And your work is more important ? Now you 've got it . Well , that 's tough shit . Cos if you let me go , then I have a duty , cos that glove could help us . If you remember . What d 'you mean ? How 's your drink ? Have you poisoned me ? Don 't be so dramatic . It 's an amnesia pill . My own recipe , with a touch of denial and a dash of retcon . Wake up tomorrow morning , you 'll have forgotten everything about Torchwood . Worse still , you 'll have forgotten me ... .. which is kind of tragic . Don 't think you can fight it by staying awake . I mixed in a little bit of sedative too . Then I 'll tell someone ! D 'you really want us to come and find them too ? You bastard . Language ! Nice knowing you , Gwen Cooper . Hello . All right ? You having a good time ? I was . Can I buy you a drink ? No , thanks , I 'm fine . Am I wasting my time ? I dunno , are you ? I 've got to be up early and I 've got hell of a day tomorrow and I can 't be bothered with all the chat . So ... do you want a drink or what ? Bloody hell fire . You 're coming home with me , you are . Right now ! Oi , you bastard , come here ! Linda , what the fuck do you think you are doing ? ! I 'm taking him home and I 'm having him , now piss off ! What the fuck d 'you think you 're doing with my girlfriend ? Hey , she was on her own . She never said . You fucking tosser . Colin , button it , he 's mine . Do you want to have a go ? You want to have a go ? Come on then mate ! Well , if it makes it easier ... I am so having you . I 'm having him first ! Taxi ! Did you get pissed ? No . What time is it ? Seven thirty . You said you were working last night . I was . Then how come you fell asleep in here ? I haven 't , I was ... typing . That is work . I 'm not having a go , I 'm just saying . Not exactly clever going out on the lash when you 've just had a bang on the head . I hope you didn 't drive in that state . Who were you with ? Diane ? Must 've been . Yeah . Have any luck ? With what ? Captain Jack Harkness . How d 'you mean ? Who 's he ? Oh , well don 't worry about me , just go ahead , wasting my time . Aye , aye . Come to see where the real work 's done ? Yes , sir , that 's right , sir . How 's it going ? Sod all . Is that the murder weapon ? Clever , mind , they worked it all out on a computer . Took measurements from the stab wounds , calculated the shape of the blade and stuff , even those prongs - I don 't know how they do it . Nasty-looking beast , though . D 'you recognise it ? No . We 're trying to trace it . Can 't be that many of ' em . Sort of ornamental . We 're checking the CDE logs with customs in case it 's been imported . Find the knife , we might find the killer . Anyway , if it rings any bells , give 's a shout . Yeah . Thanks . .. I said to Geoff , it 's not demotion being put in goal , it 's vital , but was he having any of it ? He 's off and moaning , says , who books the ground , who pays the subs ? And all the time , he 's wheezing away , and I 'm like , Geoff , you 're proving my point mate ... " You never come down , you 're in charge of transport . " I said , " Mam , I can 't go hopping on a truck ! " All that Christmas stuff , all over again , I was like , for God 's sake , leave it ... Hello again . You were right . You told Jack we should liaise with the police . I was the only one who bothered . So I was the only one who saw the report . They got a good likeness . I 'm arresting you for ... How do I know you ? I thought you saw it . And that can trip the amnesia , one image , if you 're clever . He said you were good . Anyway . It 's not much good now , I can 't really ... But you 're gonna put up a fight . So I 've got ... Um . Hold on . Sorry . There . That 's better . Put it down . You had to come back . Put down the gun . You 're the only one who can make the link . Well , the only one in public . Torchwood 's gonna find out by morning , but I 'll be gone . I don 't know where . Far away . What am I gonna do ? I loved this job . I really loved it . And now I 've got to run . Oh , Christ . How can you do any other job after this one ? Please . Put down the gun . Cos it gets inside you . You do this job for long enough , and you end up thinking , " How come we get all the Weevils and bollocks and shit ? " Is that what alien life is ? Filth ? But maybe there 's better stuff out there , brilliant stuff , beautiful stuff . Just ... they don 't come here . This planet 's so dirty , that 's all we get - the shit . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I wish I could forget . Why did you kill those people ? For the glove . Stay where you are . I needed the bodies . That 's how it works . Violent death . And it was so easy . To bring them back , I 'd position myself behind the head , so they 'd never see me twice . You killed three people . It was the only way . The more I use the glove , the more I control it . I don 't understand , what glove ? If I can get enough practice , then think what that glove could do . If I could get it work all the time , on anything , beyond the two minutes , if it could work permanently , it could resurrect . Resurrection on demand for the whole world , isn 't that good ? Isn 't it though ? Well , that 's what I 've been working for , all day and all night . The rest of them go swanning about , but I 'm working . You 've got to get inside this stuff . Surrender yourself to it . I did , with the knife , and the glove , and that 's why the perception filter isn 't gonna work on me . Where did he come from ? What have you done ? Please don 't . I can 't let you go . Please . I 've got to . I 'm sorry . Don 't , don 't , don 't . I 've got to , I 've got to , I 've got to . Put down the gun . Susie , it 's over . Now , come with me . I remember . I remember . I remember . Owen and Toshiko , you didn 't tell them that you were shot in the head and survived . You didn 't tell them either . Followed my lead . Keep doing that , and you might just get through this . But she killed you . I can 't die . OK . But I can 't . Something happened to me a while back . Long story . And far away . But I was killed , and then I was brought back to life , and ever since then ... I can 't die . But how ? I don 't know . One day , I 'll find a doctor , the right sort of doctor and maybe he can explain it . But until then ... Nothing kills you ? Kind of freaks people out , so ... Best if you don 't say anything . It doesn 't matter anyway . You 'll only wipe my memory again . Why would I do that ? Torchwood 's got a vacancy . Job going spare . Do you want it ? But what d 'you need me for ? Cos maybe you were right . We could do more to help . What d 'you think , d 'you want to join up ? Yeah . I do . Yes . Is that plane on fire ? I 've got to go to work . So let 's see what we came for . There 's an alien on the loose , we don 't know where it is , why it 's here . The over-riding factor for the parasite is to have sex . It 's a struggle between where Carys ends and the alien begins . Sorry ? What 's this for ? Please help me . Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd 2006 E-mail : subtitling @ bbc.co.uk

 Previously on Heroes . You 're special . And I couldn 't kill you even if I wanted to . That formula could destroy the whole world . I was just heading out to get the other half of this . It 's not right that you 're here . Tells me the future is not as I have painted it . You must spirit walk for many miles . I was the one who shot you . What do I do next ? You 're gonna make the right choices . I 'd be honored to serve as junior senator from New York . That 's not me . You can 't run this story . And I 've called someone to help out while I 'm gone . Mom ? They 're villains , Claire . I 'm one of the only people on the planet that knows enough to stop them . Come on . Come on . Hurry , hurry . Jesse ! Where is he ? Where did they go ? Escaped . I put him in the body of that guy in that cell , right there . You need to look out for someone who looks just like me . My sons have been such a disappointment . But you , I can give you what all boys crave from their mothers . Inspiration and guidance , comfort . You are not my mother . But I am , dear . I should never have given you up for adoption . But now , I 'm going to take good care of you , just like a good mother . My mother . Yes . Because you 're right . You are very special . And you need to be strong for what 's to come . Bridget ? Would you join us please ? You wanted to see me ? This is Bridget , and she has a very special ability . Any object she touches , she can see its history . Everywhere it 's been , everyone who 's ever touched it . What 's she gonna do to me ? Feed you . In the ongoing search for self , there are days when we learn something genuinely new . Something uncovered , hidden , that we never knew was there . Something that surprises us . And on that day of self-discovery , a question remains . What kind of person are we ? Does the hero or the villain inside us win the day ? Is Tracy here yet ? No , sir , still no answer . Where 's my brother ? I don 't know . I 'm looking for him , too . You called me ? Peter left me a message last night . But it wasn 't his voice . Nathan , it 's Peter . I 'm trapped in the body of this guy . I just broke out of Level 5 with these criminals . I 'm trying to get back , but I 'm really afraid they 're gonna hurt somebody . Maybe we should come back at night . It 'll be empty . That 's not exactly the plan now , is it ? You 're terrified , Jesse . I can feel it . What 's up ? Nothing . Nothing , I 'm good . Light it up . Everyone on the ground , now ! I expected you back earlier , Noah . All of these prisoners escaped , most of whom you put away . You can take the man out of the Company ... Let me be clear . I am not here to reenlist . I 'm here to make sure these psychopaths get put back in their cages where they belong , and then I return to my family . And our Claire . I 'm gonna need my old partner . Well , unfortunately , the Haitian is unavailable . He 's on a pickup assignment for me . I can 't do this alone . You know how it works . One of us , one of them . Don 't worry . I have the perfect one of them in mind . Meet your new partner . Just keep your heads down . All of you . Uh , uh , uh . No alarms . I 'm sorry . Yeah , you are . But maybe you can work it off . I hear that Stockholm syndrome is like Spanish fly . Leave her alone . What are you gonna do , Jesse ? You gonna stop me ? Yeah , I am . This is open . Let 's go collect our winnings . Thank you . Mom ? Oh ... We don 't smoke in the house . Sorry . So , you 're Claire 's real mom ? Biological mom . Your dad asked me to stick around , help protect you guys while he 's away . With fire ? Yeah . Claire , you got everything ready to get back to school today ? I 'm not going . Excuse me ? Well , it is very clear that my life will never be normal , so I 've decided to stop trying . You decided ? Your father and I ... Dad 's not here . He doesn 't get a vote . He 's out there protecting all of us . Yeah , he 's out there stopping villains , helping people , doing the same thing that I should be doing with my life . You 're a 17-year-old girl . Who can 't get hurt . Can 't die . Can 't even feel pain . You just don 't understand . I think that what Claire 's trying to say here is that when you 're like us ... Meredith , I 'm thrilled that you 're here to protect us , but I know how to talk to my daughter , thank you . Claire , get ready for school . Now . You expect me to work with this animal after what he did to my daughter ? Your granddaughter ? He nearly killed her . She can 't die . You really don 't understand her , do you ? Noah . We just let a dozen criminals out into a world that is grossly unprepared to deal with them . So your solution is to send the psychopath after the psychopaths . He 's the perfect partner . And he can 't be killed anyway , you know that . He 's a murderer . Then you and Gabriel have more in common than you care to admit . He 's been misunderstood . He just needs structure , and you 're the perfect person to give it to him . And if I refuse ? I can 't make you do anything you don 't want to , but I am going to put Gabriel in play . It 's your call whether or not it 's under your supervision . Nemesis . Stop calling me that . My name is Daphne . And why are you two following me ? You know why . I want my father 's formula back . That ? Too late . It 's been delivered and paid for . I 'm on to the next half . There 's another half ? There 's supposed to be some sort of exchange going down at this theater , and I 'm waiting to intercept . You 're telling us your plan ? What kind of overconfident nemesis are you ? You 're 0-2 against me , Pikachu . That 's just regular confidence . Pikachu ? We will find the other half of the formula before you , and we will save the world . Yeah , good luck with that . I 'm slow . What did you do ? Whatever . I don 't need powers to beat you two losers . Well , that went well , don 't you think ? Welcome to the Bennet household . What is with this new superhero kick , anyway ? There are bad people out there . I just feel like I should help . Sure , you wanna help people , huh ? I keep trying to be normal . Fit in . But I just end up the victim . Your mom told me about your attack . You feel like talking about it ? I just wanna move past it , and I want to do something . Fight them . How are you gonna do that , huh ? How are you gonna learn how to fight ? Well , I was hoping you could teach me . Hop in . We 're gonna play hooky today . It 's open . Had my swearing in this morning . You kind of missed it . Everything okay ? You called me Niki Sanders yesterday . Then a reporter shows me this . Last year , at the Corinthian Hotel in Las Vegas . Just tell me who the hell she is . I still kind of think that 's you . I 'm just waiting for this all to make sense . It 's not me . Look , I 'm trying to find her , talk to her . All I can get is an address is New Orleans . Tell me what you know about her . You 're really not Niki Sanders ? I need to go to New Orleans . This is all of it . Let 's move . How the hell did they know we were here ? Probably because I called them . You what ? It wasn 't just about the money . In fact , it was mostly about revenge . It 's only about the money for me . That 's why I 'm going to take mine and leave before the Company shows up . The Company 's supposed to show up while I got all these scared people powering me up . Hey , we got what we need . Let 's just get out of here . You 're scared , too , aren 't you ? What the hell are you doing ? He was gonna ruin your plan . Yeah , what is the plan exactly ? We stay put , raise hell , and wait for the man the Company sends when super-people do bad things . And after he gets here , then I beat his horn-rimmed glasses right into his skull . Right , Jesse ? Hey , man . This spirit walk , how long does it last ? It 's your spirit walk , Parkman , not mine . Why the hell was I teleported to Africa ? For that matter , how do you know my name ? From your badge . From my badge ? What do you mean ? My police badge ? When I was boy , I went on the spirit walk to find truth . To hunt . But my spirit animal tell me to gather berries , many colors . They were my paint . And you were my subject , Parkman . So , you learned everything about me from this painting ? This I paint when I was a boy . I 'm not a boy anymore . It fits . Good . Are you really my mother ? You 've always understood , on some level , that you weren 't the son of a watch repairman and a woman who collects Hummel figurines . He 's right , I 'm a killer . That 's all I am . No , it 's not your fault . It 's your ability . There 's a hunger that you cannot control . It 's made you that way . But we 're gonna fix that . I think I 've just found a few of them . They made the news . Police were called to what was described as an incredible scene when four gunmen came in to rob the First Federal Bank in Poughkeepsie , New York , this morning . One of the robbers was equipped with ... Peter . ... what appears to be a flamethrower . Police are saying ... He 's in the body of one of those escapees . Which one ? Jesse . Does he have Jesse 's ability ? If he does , he doesn 't know what it is . ... video taken from a surveillance camera in hopes of identifying the robbers . Police have called in SWAT teams and hostage negotiators ... Is he ready ? That 's all the Japanese I know . What are you guys looking at , anyway ? Go away , we were here first . You can 't call dibs . Can , too . Dibs . Why are you doing this ? Do you want the world to end ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I work for a guy . I find stuff , he pays me . Simple as that . You 're doing this for money ? Is your friend always so self-righteous ? Hiro takes his job very seriously . And what are you , like , his sidekick ? Partner . Like Robin to his Batman . I understand what you 're doing . But Hiro 's my best friend . We will never leave each other 's side . Hiro ? This is my life . It happened exactly like this . The future can only be the future for so long . Then it becomes the present . Except for this one . I don 't remember this . This must be my future future . It was , but not anymore . The future has changed . Changed to what ? Hey . Come on . You can 't just tell a guy that his future has changed and not ... Hey , man , come on . Are you even listening to ... So , what if he doesn 't show ? He always does . He 's like Santa Claus . And then we 're gonna get our payback . I don 't think I want it anymore . I sat in a cell next to you , month after month , this is all you talked about . One-stop shopping , revenge and retirement . About being free ? I never told you , but it gave me hope . It probably saved my life . Yeah , but we 're free now . Why do you wanna tempt fate ? What are you so afraid of ? I just don 't wanna go back . I don 't like feeling trapped , powerless . I just wanna get back to my old life . Yeah , I bet you can 't wait to get to your family and friends in Detroit . Yeah , exactly . Except Jesse 's family 's from Vegas . And he ain 't got no friends . So who the hell are you ? You do realize she 's playing us , don 't you ? This is all one big game to her . Maybe . But aren 't you curious to see how it all plays out ? So , how do we do this ? We do nothing . I take care of the escapees and Petrelli . That sounds like a one-sided partnership . We 're not partners . You just stay close and keep your mouth shut . Who the hell is in charge around here ? What are you doing ? I 'm Lieutenant Chory , who are you ? Special Agent Andrew Hanson , FBI . Lieutenant , you mind telling me why these barricades aren 't 30 feet further back ? You want the media up our ass ? Sir ! I 'm in the middle ... Or are you just trying to get one of these lookie-Ioo civilians killed ? You heard the man . Back these horses up . All hands . And we 're gonna need some coffee . Decaf . You drink decaf , right , Noah ? I already told you . Somebody put me in his body against my will . I swear . Then why did you come along with us ? You had plenty of chances to bail . You said you were going to hurt people . I couldn 't let that happen . Now I know you 're full of it . Nobody 's that heroic . The formula hasn 't been moved in years . Why now ? Given recent events , Mrs. Petrelli deemed it wise to keep her half closer to home . We going in ? I am . You 're waiting out here . What 's that gonna protect you from ? Nothing . It 's for show . You 're going in without your gun , too ? Knox wants me unarmed , he says he 'll release the hostages . You do realize they 're not gonna let you out alive ? That 's very touching . The monster cares about my well being . Are you so concerned with proving that you 're better than me , that you 're willing to get yourself killed ? I am better than you . I can help . Let me do something . All right . Debrief the hostages . Use that silver tongue of yours to defuse their stories , but under no circumstances are you to go anywhere near that buffet in there . Got me ? Yeah . Hello ? Mom ? You 're not my mother . No , I 'm not . Your mom and I look so much alike . But I don 't know anything about her . God , I imagine this is so strange for you . Yeah , kind of . I should go . I 'm sorry . You look just like her . Are you special , too ? Like my mom ? I 'm not sure what you mean . She had a power . She was super strong , like the Hulk . It 's okay if you don 't wanna talk about it . It was hard for my mom to handle at first , too . Gets easier , though . Are you special , too , Micah ? I can talk to machines . You can talk to machines ? Yeah . Maybe I can help you get some of your answers . What 's your last name ? Strauss , two Ss . I can cross-reference every bit of information on both you and my mom . Just one match . You were both born in the same hospital in California . Same day . Same doctor , too . Dr. Zimmerman . Now you know one thing about her . Goodbye . I 've got it . I 've been looking everywhere . I believe this is my briefcase . No , you are mistaken . This is mine . Wait , we call someone . Usher ! Movie usher ! Hold on . Please ! Huh ? Popcorn ? The hostages are coming out . Hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! This way , this way . Follow the officer to safety . You took away my life . You 're a criminal , Knox . Criminals get trials and lawyers . Me , I got stuck in super Guantanamo . You got a bum rap , is that it ? I think you get off being judge , jury and executioner . Now it 's my turn . Knox , you don 't have to do this . You can walk away , you 're free now . Shut up ! I 'm done listening to you . No . No one dies today ! Listen to me ! You . What the hell did you do ? I came to find you , get you out of here . Out of here ? We need to stop this , he 's in trouble . The world is in trouble , don 't you get it ? You need to listen to me . You shot my brother . Trapped me . Why should I believe a thing you say ? You 're right . I need to show you . Thanks , Peter . You okay ? Peter 's not here anymore . Where are we going ? You wanted to learn how to fight . Lock the door . Are you sure you wanna do this ? Yeah . All right , we 'll start at the beginning . Survival . I 've already mastered survival . I need to learn how to fight . There 's some things you can 't fight , Claire . Looks like the man with the plan just ran out of options . Turn yourself in , and nobody has to get hurt . Who the hell do you think you are ? Just a guy with a partner standing right behind you . I told you to stay put . You told me that to make sure I wouldn 't , didn 't you ? What 's this supposed to prove ? I 've walked through fire before and I haven 't gotten burned . You 've never been burned ? I 'm indestructible . I can 't feel pain . Well , you ever suffocate ? 'Cause I would imagine , the air is getting pretty thin in here . Why are you doing this ? Why do you wanna stop bad guys ? I told you , to help people . That 's what you keep saying , but I don 't believe you . You know what water boarding is , Claire ? No . It 's a method of torture . You 're not drowning , but your body tells your mind that you are . You think you 're doing to die . Trapped , you panic . Trapped . Does that remind you of anything ? Stop it . Turn it off . Is this how it was with Sylar , huh ? You 're indestructible , but you couldn 't get away , right ? That must have made you feel trapped , helpless . Please , stop . I can 't . Why do you want to stop the bad guys , huh ? To help people . I don 't believe you . You tell me why . To hurt him , okay ? To hurt him for what he did . Like he hurt me . What do we do now ? While I get him patched up , you tell the locals that these are federal prisoners and we get them back to Level 5 . Yeah , okay . Hey ! What are you doing ? He 's getting away . You were right . I am just a killer . No . No , you don 't have to do this . She 's right . You don 't have to do this . You can fight it . No . I don 't think I can . It 's the hunger . I 'm sorry I tricked you like that . I just did it for your own good . Right . It 's only been a couple of days since you went through all that . You got a really good family . You got a nice home . I know . You 're right . You don 't just wake up one day and know what life 's all about . You know , you got to build it brick by brick . And you got to learn to save yourself before you can save the world . There ain 't nothing wrong with just being a 17-year-old girl for a while . You got that ? Yeah . I got that . Come here . Who is she ? What happened to her ? It 's your future , Parkman . Not mine . Yeah . We cannot understand these things . No , this is it . This is it . I can feel it . This is the reason I 'm here . My spirit walk . So , that means I can stop that from happening , right ? You really want to know ? Hmm . School just called . Claire didn 't show up today . You know anything about that ? I 'm sorry . You know , I just thought that seeing as she 's ... You don 't get to do that . Think about Claire . That 's me , not you . I 'm the one who 's been here . Changed her diapers , checked her spelling . Me . Not you . Sandra , I 'm not trying to take your place . Do you think this is a game ? She just got attacked . Hurt . Yeah , that 's right . And she 's looking to push back . And there 's nothing you can do to stop that . In fact , smothering her , that 's the best way to drive her away real quick . Don 't you ever assume you know anything about me and my daughter . I just did what I thought was best to keep her here . Safe . I got it . Hey . Hey , you ready ? One second . I totally forgot about the cheerleader sleepover retreat , I 'm sorry . Is it cool ? Sure . Barbara ? No , my name is Tracy Strauss . Are you Dr. Zimmerman ? Oh ... The one from Beverly Hills , huh ? Come in . How do you know I 'm from Beverly Hills ? Do you know me ? Know you ? I created you . No , I don 't think it 's working . Here . Try this . And as the search for self continues , we look for answers everywhere . In nature . In God . In tiny tragedies that may never be understood . But still we are driven to it . Single-minded , on one goal . To find our purpose on this earth . No matter what the ramification , the friendships that may be hurt or the deals with the devil we need to make . I guess you were wrong about me . We 'll see . Am I being replaced ? Only for a while . Just until I find his weakness . And then I 'm gonna kill him .

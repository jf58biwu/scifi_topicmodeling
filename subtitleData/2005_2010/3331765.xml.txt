 I forgot where I am . You 're at the place where the killers meet to decide what to do with the crippled girl . that 's right . That 's right . Did you hear that ? That 's funny . That 's weird . Those people look like they 're clawing at themselves . Is that blood ? are you seeing this ? Claire . Claire ? Claire ? What page was I on ? Page . I need an extension over here . Fall back . Fall back . You kidding me ? Like another 20 feet . Don 't touch that . That 's for the drywall guys . I told you he wouldn 't do it ! I saw your thing and it said ' WY . " ' have a nice day . " ' McKenzie fell . we have a major accident at the south side of the building . We 'll need an ambulance . Copy . Jesus . Give him some room . Hey ! Somebody fell ! he just fell ! Someone fell ! Over that building ! my God ! my God ! Watch it . Get out of there ! Help ! Look out ! Look out ! God in heaven . I don 't know if you guys have heard about this article in The New York Times about honeybees vanishing ? honeybees are disappearing all over the country . Tens of millions of them . Just disappearing . no sign of them . They 're just mysteriously gone . huh ? let 's hear some theories about why this might be happening . guys . Laura . Disease ? Right . Could be a virus or infection . But it 's all over the country . It 's a coordinated event in 24 states . It 's a little tricky . Pollution ? Could be . we 're just pumping so much junk into the environment they 're just keeling over . But there are no bodies . Keep guessing . Dylan . Global warming . makes them disoriented ? Maybe . Jake ? You don 't have an opinion ? You 're not interested in what happened to the bees ? Jake . You know why ? Because your face is perfect . your face is perfect at 15 . you would know facts like the human nose and ears grow a fraction of an inch each year . So a perfect balance of features now might not look so perfect five years from now . They might look downright whack 10 years from now . buddy . Take an interest in science . What could be a reason the bees have vanished ? An act of nature and we 'll never fully understand it . Jake . He 's right . it 'll be just a theory . We will fail to acknowledge that there are forces at work beyond our understanding . you must have a respectful awe for the laws of nature . Jake ? How much does the human nose grow each year ? okay ? Don 't worry about it . You 're gonna be a heartthrob your whole life . I was just messing with you . The Dark Lord . Don 't look into her eyes . Vice Principal ! What can we do for you ? Mr. Moore . calm down . I 'll be right back . What is that ? I can 't believe it . my God . I 've never seen anything like it before . What 's going on ? I don 't know . You excused all the teachers ? The administration makes us teach with a foot of snow on the ground . What is this ? They stopped class . Elliot ! All right . There appears to be an event happening . Central Park was just hit by what seems to be a terrorist attack . no . They 're not clear on the scale yet . It 's some kind of airborne chemical toxin that 's been released in and around the park . They said to watch for warning signs . The first stage is confused speech . loss of direction . The third stage is fatal . Central Park ? That 's kind of odd . I spoke with the head of schools . He said we should dismiss the students . So take your planners home so we can get back when this is over . All right ? Let 's do our jobs . you guys still got to work on your science projects for next week . What are the rules of scientific investigation ? Identify variables . Design the experiment . Careful observation and measurement . Interpretation of experimental data . guys ? Nothing . please . My mother just called my cell again . She 's hysterical . Hysterical . I told her the probability of something happening in Philadelphia is very low . right ? So I threw some figures at her . It 's good to be a math teacher sometimes . people are comforted by percentages . Didn 't work . She still wants us to get out of the city and come out to her house . But she said for you and Alma to come . okay ? Did you hear about New York ? Are you okay ? are you okay ? I want to talk about it more . Julian 's mom offered for all of us to get out of the city and stay with her . What do you think ? Chris ! I 'll bring Jess and Evette and I 'll meet you at the station . okay ? What 's going on ? okay ? Odd ? if she 's acting like she 's distant or something . What ? I can 't say any more . Is she leaving you ? please ? Hey . I 'm going to tell you something you should never tell your best friend . Why is everybody saying that ? I saw her on your wedding day . Again with the wedding . What ? and she was crying . She looked up . I saw her face . Elliot . That 's not who she is . man . state and local officials have a plan in place for this type of catastrophe ? Are they utilizing all the manpower or the money . Hi . Are you packed ? Yes . What are they saying ? They 're evacuating New York City . our brains come equipped with a selfpreservation mechanism to stop us from harmful actions . This is controlled by a combination of electrochemical signals in the brain . The blocking of neurotransmitters by certain toxins asphyxiation and paralysis . causing specific selfdamaging and catastrophic effects . Just how the toxin works and who the terrorists are . It makes you kill yourself . Just when you thought there couldn 't be any more evil that could be invented . I 'll be packed in two minutes . Hello ? No need to rush . Sir . Thank you . we need to check your suitcase . Elliot ! Elliot ! Elliot ! This just in to the Eyewitness News room and this is the latest development . Autopsies on the first victims confirm the toxin is a natural compound . The attacks remain confined to the New York metropolitan area . very disturbing story . Track three now boarding for Harrisburg . Jess . Where 's Evette ? she got stuck in traffic . She 's gonna take the next train . We 'll wait . no . She wanted us to get on this train with Jess . She 'll feel a lot safer . Where 's Alma ? Restroom . Julian ! ladies and gentlemen . I bought them . It was like getting one of those Cabbage Patch Dolls when they first came out . Madhouse . How are you ? Good . You ? Good . good . Why don 't we all . I 'm really glad you chose to come . can I talk to you for a second ? Yeah . ladies and gentlemen . You told him about our fight ? No . Why did he say that ? He guessed . but I don 't like to put my feelings out there for everyone to see . I 'm not that type of person . these are our problems . I am upset . I 'm going to sit alone and cool off . By the time we get there I 'll be fine . Is that okay ? Fine . I 'm going to get on the train . We 're not gonna get to sit together anyways . Okay . babe . Aunt Alma . How you doing ? too . What 's wrong with you ? What ? You 're wrong about her . She just needs time to figure it out . don 't get all sensitive . fine . If you don 't want my help . I don 't want your help ! Okay . I heard it . please ? Jess . Track 3 now boarding all ticketed passengers . Here we go . When will Mom meet us at Grandma 's ? Mommy 's gonna get on the next train . You know how she 's always late . Come on . Come on . I know . I know . Mom . Sal ? Maybe a little . okay ? You 've got to stop calling me . here . I feel like I 'm going to take a shower and see your silhouette on the shower curtain . that is it . I told you that would be it . You have got to chill out . What ? When ? In Philadelphia ? my God . I can 't believe it . What 's the news ? Apparently Philadelphia was just attacked . my God . Evette . Call Mommy . Call Mommy ! Honey ! where are you ? What ? What ? I can 't hear you . I said I can 't hear you ! Text me . Text me . I can 't hear you ! They think it started in Rittenhouse Square Park . Another park ? She got on a bus going to New Jersey . I want to talk to her . baby . I know . She got out . She 's headed to the town of Princeton . I want to talk to her . I 'm sorry . too . Where 'd you hear that ? A friend from work . What about Evette ? God . She made it out on a bus . Elliot ? I honestly don 't know . Now what ? It just stopped . I don 't know . Can 't go nowhere . They 're not telling us anything . until we hear from . Sir ? Train service has been discontinued . This will be the last stop for all passengers . Hey ! What do you mean ? Where are we ? Pennsylvania . Filbert ? Does anybody know where that is ? Why are you giving me one useless piece of information at a time ? What 's going on ? why would you just stop ? You can 't just leave us here . we lost contact . With whom ? Everyone . I 'm scared . I don 't like it here . I want Mom . okay ? Sorry . She whispers to us when she gets scared . either . She 's shivering . I know . I know . She 's never right without her mom . It 's okay . They 're not saying anything . We 're stuck here . Is Jess okay ? She 's not talking . Jess . Nothing will happen to us here . Don 't know what you want ? okay ? come over here . you know what ? Why don 't you stay here ? all right ? You can see me from over there . you want to come with me ? You can come with me and wait in line . You want to do that ? I got it . Go get the milk . yeah . Okay . right ? It 's scientifically proven . They got these cameras that can record what color you are when you 're feeling different things . People that are angry give off a different color than people that are sad . See this ring ? This ring can supposedly tell you what you 're feeling . Let 's see what you 're feeling right now . Yellow ! That 's cool . That means you 're about to laugh . I 'm not making it up . That 's what yellow means . You must be about to laugh or something . It 's probably just about to come out . We 'll wait . We got all day . my God . There it is ! Cool . That ring really works . That 's amazing . my God . Look at this . My sister sent it to me . It was taken an hour ago at the Philadelphia Zoo . what kind of terrorists are these ? They 're not sure it 's terrorists now . the government moved away from its initial position that this was a terrorist attack . that a terrorist group being responsible is becoming less and less likely . where smaller and smaller towns are being attacked . Where are we ? from Massachusetts to Maryland . We 're dead center . Everything okay ? we are gonna die here . it looks like it 's not occurring about 90 miles from here . Let 's go . Anyone got a car ? Can anyone give us a ride ? Hey ! sir ? please ? We don 't have any transportation . We 're stuck here . did you hear what I said ? We don 't have any transportation ! We have a little girl with us . Please . Drive . Just roll up the window . Sir ! You 're not just going to . Can you believe how crappy people are ? There 's a car . Hi . I run a plant nursery up the street . then heading wherever this isn 't happening . We have room . We have two others . That 's okay . Julian ! Is Julian okay ? We got a ride . He can fit all of us . I can 't get Evette on the phone or email or nothing . How long ? It 's been about two hours . She was on that bus headed to Princeton . they said they could squeeze one more . We got to go . think real carefully about this . She was looking for a birthday present for Jess . Some kind of dollhouse . That 's why she wasn 't with us . and then I 'm gonna find you guys . okay ? She 's gonna be a lot safer with you . Don 't do this to me . I 'm doing my best here not to fall down . I 'm sure the probability of Princeton not being hit is good . Yeah . You want me to throw some figures and percentages at you so we both feel better ? Please . All right . 62 % chance . 62 % chance it hasn 't even been hit . of course . that 's all . We 're all gonna be fine . I 'm gonna find you guys real soon . I have to go . Julian . Don 't take my daughter 's hand unless you mean it . I 'm going to go get Mommy . Hold our picture . Take a look around . We 'll be ready in a jiffy . We 're packing hot dogs for the road . hot dogs get a bad rap . they 've got protein . right ? I think I know what 's causing this . You do ? It 's the plants . They can release chemicals . don 't you ? okay ? plants react to human stimulus . They 've proved it in tests . Did you get the mustard ? Don 't look outside . Stop it ! Stop it ! Just look at me ! Just keep looking at me ! Close the vents . okay ? And you 're gonna tell me the answer . What ? How much would you have if I said I would pay you a penny on the first day and then four pennies on the third day and I just kept doubling it and I did this for a month ? How much money would you have at the end of the month ? higher . Just keep looking at me . Just keep looking at me . Twenty dollars ? keep going . Keep going . Thirty . It 's thirty . It 's $ 30 . I 'm gonna tell you the answer . It 's over $ 10 million . You 'd have over $ 10 million at the end of the month . You want to hear another one ? Water contamination has surfaced as one of the many theories being taken seriously as to the cause of the events in the Northeast . We have to go through this little community of homes . then we hit the highway . we 're 30 miles from the state line . Are those dead animals up ahead ? Stop the car . You don 't think it 's . I don 't know . from when you were spying on our neighbors . Can I have the map ? Elliot . okay ? Jess can hear you . isn 't it ? I knew it would be bodies . How could it not be bodies ? give me the map . we have to turn around . There 's a right turn about a quarter of a mile back . okay ? it 's the Army . We 're safe ! My name is Private Auster . about 10 miles back . I think they 've been affected by whatever 's happening . I lost communication with them . in the fence . So I suggest no one take that road . There 's a town about eight miles behind us . There were bodies on the road into town . Cheese and crackers . that still leaves us two directions . Just stop ! Stop the vehicle ! What 's going on ? Is everyone all right ? We have no communication with anybody . I 'll talk to them . Did you see anything out of the ordinary ? Hello ! Please stop ! Excuse me . Who 's Joey ? it 's no one . Any luck ? I can 't get Julian on his cell phone . I 'm sure he 'll be all right . They 'll be okay . Has anyone seen any other people on the roads ? Maybe he 's on to something . What are you talking about ? I don 't know . Why did it start in parks ? nine miles back . They say there 's a bus in a lake . Five miles back . There were dozens of bodies . Okay . Nobody 's going anywhere . We 're gonna stay right here for a while . There 's a woman talking to her daughter . She 's talking to her daughter in Princeton . Isn 't that where your friend went ? Come on . it 's okay . She 's so scared . You just stay in that room . You don 't open the door for nothing . baby . Someone will come and get you soon . Tell her not to go near the window with the tree . Just tell her . don 't go near the window with the tree . Ask her if Princeton 's been affected . someone wants to know if Princeton 's had any problems . She says everyone 's dead outside . You just stay in your room . Honey ? you 're talking funny . What 's wrong with you ? What do you mean ? Everyone 's dead ? What ? you 're scaring me . I don 't understand what you 're saying . baby ? She 's just not making any sense . Calculus . I see in calculus . Calculus . Stacy ! Calculus . Stacy ! Stacy Ann ! my God . no . Stacy . no ! Jess ? where would that take us ? it was clean . no nothing . Quarter mile ? That 's not enough . it 's better than going back the other way . Get a battle plan . Everybody makes a clean break . isn 't he ? Yeah . He never gives up . plants have the ability to target specific threats . when attacked by Heliothis caterpillars will send out a chemical attracting wasps to kill just those caterpillars . We don 't know how plants attain these abilities . They just evolve very rapidly . Which species do you think is doing it if you think it 's true ? Plants have the ability to communicate with other species of plants . bushes with grass and everything in between . The radio says these attacks started happening in the cities then went to the towns and now the roads . That 's right . Whatever 's happening is happening to smaller and smaller populations . then . or whatever could be watching the roads . I don 't have any reason to disagree right now . We are in the area of attack . If you can 't find a way through the area of attack we are told to find a safe zone within the area being attacked . They 're attacking populations . We need to go where there aren 't that many people . Where people don 't travel . Now this is Mr. Collins . He 's a realtor that works in this area . we 'll hit a county called Arundell . It 's not on that map . It would only be on local maps . Dirt roads . Hardly anybody lives out there . There 's no significant population there . That 's our safe zone . We wait it out there till it 's over . Is everyone in agreement ? We should go into two groups . Those that are ready to go right now and those that need to get things from their cars . We need to stay in groups . Stay together . honey . We 'll go soon . like the Private said . too ? What 's wrong ? okay ? Joey . His name is Joey . He 's at work . We went out and we had dessert . I went out and I had dessert with him when I told you I worked late . And I didn 't work late . I 'm feeling really guilty in case we 're gonna die . I just wanted you to know that . You lied to me ? How much farther is it ? I don 't know . We need to keep going forward . Who the hell made you boss ? you 're gonna live . I 'm in charge of this group ! Ain 't nobody else in charge of this group ! My firearm is my friend ! It will not leave my side ! Private Auster ? My firearm is my friend . Jesus . no . no " ? The toxin ? The toxin is affecting them ? Are those people killing themselves ? You were with the Private . What do we do ? We need to do something ! Just let me think . They 're dying ! I need a second . They released it ? We 're not near the roads . We can 't just stand here as uninvolved observers ! okay . Just give me a second ! We are not going to be one of those assholes on the news who watches a crime happen and not do something ! We 're not assholes ! Just a second ! There were children in that group ! okay ! Why can 't anybody give me a goddamn second ? douchebag . Identify the variables . That 's the two groups . Design an experiment . That 's what we 're in . Careful observation and measurements . That 's what I 'm trying to do . Interpret the experimental data . Interpret . What if it is the plants ? Their group was larger than ours . This thing has been escalating all day . Smaller and smaller populations have been setting this off . They react to human stimulus . Maybe people are setting off the plants ? What are you saying ? That guy was crazy . We have to save them . They 're already dead . What if they 're targeting us as threats ? This part of the field may not have been set off . Something in this field could be releasing the chemical into the air when there 's too many of us together . Let 's just stay ahead of the wind . Let 's just break up into groups . follow me ! I 'm right here ! Keep going ! I 'm right behind you ! Here it comes ! Don 't you let go of my hand . Nothing happened . I think . Could this really be happening ? What are your names ? Jared . Josh . wait ! I 'm going to go see if that truck has a map . You guys wait here . Why aren 't they looking into nuclear power plants ? There are 15 or more in the Northeast alone . More than anywhere else in the United States . There 's probably been some leak or something . It 's probably poisoning the air . There 's a house over there ! Come on ! someone stepped on it out in the field . Pennsylvania . I don 't know . a toxin dissipates quickly in the air . They 're only potent in a certain density . if not in the field . Here 's one . Plants have the chemistry to do this . They release cotransporters into the air . You think it could be plants ? I don 't know . we need to go to the least populated place we can to be safe . Alma . It 's too far . it 's probably safe to get away from people right now . That must be Arundell . It 's 10 miles from here . then we can leave . Hurry . Hello ? My name is Elliot Moore . I 'm just going to talk in a very positive manner . Giving off good vibes . We 're just here to use the bathroom and then we 're just gonna leave . I hope that 's okay . Plastic . I 'm talking to a plastic plant . I 'm still doing it . You guys ready to leave ? leaving the front door unlocked ? everything 's fake . Why is this happening ? Josh . But I read this article about the coast of Australia . It said they found large quantities of a primordial bacteria . it just appeared in the water . fishermen who come in contact with it are dying . It feels kind of similar to that . it feels like a pattern . The nature of events like the one in Australia is that they crest and then stop . We just have to be alive when it 's over . I don 't believe it 's nature . It may not be . There could be some other explanation . I don 't know . Let 's go . There are people coming ! We can 't stay here . It 's close to the roads . More and more people will come here . There 's two groups coming together . There 's too many of them together . Run . Run . Is she your kid ? No . You got kids ? No . How come ? You got a problem ? No . She wanted to wait . Really ? For what ? Me to grow up . Why are we talking about this ? Sweet . I used to love those . Can I see it ? You need to take personal responsibility for yourself in a relationship . That 'll make a difference . Okay . Thank you . that 's not a toy . It 's got meaning to me . Elliot ! Look ! Come on . wow . .is an emergency broadcast . All those who are still inside the affected area of the Northeast are asked to proceed to the police borders west of your state . Come on . This is an emergency broadcast . .inside the affected area . Jess needs a 10minute rest and some food . Are you sure ? We should keep going . but she 's only eight . What ? I want you to know something . and there was a really goodlooking pharmacist behind the counter . Really goodLooking . And I went up and I asked her where the cough syrup was . I didn 't even have a cough . And I almost bought it . And I 'm talking about a completely superfluous bottle of cough syrup . That 's like six bucks . Are you joking ? Thank you . Maybe that 's not a good idea . I told her just for a minute . I think I can open this door . Wait . We 're a gang now ? We 're gonna take whatever we want ? nobody 's home . We 're just gonna get some food for Jess . and it looks like nobody 's lived here for a long time anyway . it 's all boarded up . Maybe we could leave some money . What kind of tree is this ? I think it 's a maple . Not so high . open the door . Wait ! I see something . There 's somebody in there ! You sure ? I saw him move . I see him ! Let 's stop . Is there any way we could get some food ? We have a little girl . We just want to get her some food . You best leave now . You ain 't gonna bring that poison gas in here with you . it 's not poison gas . There 's none out here . They said to stay inside . We 're fine right now . Nothing 's happened out here yet . you can see that . Just listen to our voices . We 're perfectly normal . keep on rolling Mississippi moon Won 't you keep on shining on me ? See ? We 're normal . You ain 't from around here . You 'd best leave now . Okay . It 's not worth it . bitch ! don 't do that . He didn 't mean that ! come here . you pussies ! stop it . You 'd best not let that gas in here . the air is fine out here right now . You don 't need to worry . sir . Mr. Moore ! Show your faces ! Let the gas in . No ! Jared ! We 're gonna get out of this nightmare . Elliot ! We have to go . We have to protect Jess . Okay ? You 've got to three to get off our porch ! Come here . No new people have crossed over the border for a few hours . It appears those residents that are still in the affected area of the Northeast are trying to wait it out . what can you tell us ? Calculating by the rise in intensity of reports of incidents one can guess at a crude timetable . One can see the incident is rising in sensitivity . We 've seen fewer and fewer people can provoke the attacks . The event should be at its most sensitive tomorrow morning . at any moment . these are only probabilities . There are some quiet rumblings that the government may be involved in the tragic events these rumors have been fuelled by the statements of a confidential informant where they are testing drugs with some similar psychotropic properties as a defense against chemical weapons . CIA and White House officials have declined to respond to these accusations . Perimeters have been set up all along the East Coast from Maryland all the way to Massachusetts . This house has no power going to it . either . Let me go . You guys stay right here . That 's for Clement . He 's a retriever . You lost ? You must be . There ain 't nothing around here for miles . Why are you eyeing my lemon drink ? I suppose the kind thing for me to do is to offer you supper . I ain 't gonna ask you again . I hope the meal was sufficient . I wasn 't expecting guests . This is a beautiful place . There 's a springhouse in the back . They used to hide people from slave chasers back there . It has a speaking tube running under the ground to the main house . You can hear each other like you were in the same room . what 's with you two ? Who 's chasing who ? I 'm sorry ? equal . someone is chasing someone . That 's the way we 's built . So ? Who 's chasing ? I knew that . I knew that . Don 't touch things that aren 't yours . Mrs. Jones ? No . I got enough to fill my time right here . I mend my own things . I grow my own food . Although I ain 't got the touch . Gardens don 't grow the way they should . Never have . How do you stay in contact with others ? I don 't . How would you know if something were to happen ? Like a world event ? something 's happened along the East Coast . Whatever it is that you think is so important don 't . Just keep it to yourself . The world don 't care about me . I don 't care about it . Suppose I have to let you spend the night . Guest room 's up on the left . Mind the steps . Elliot . It 's okay . I 'm sorry about everything . That Joey thing . I was being stupid . You 've been great taking care of Jess . I don 't like this woman . There 's something Exorcisty about her . How could she hit Jess like that ? we need to stay in this house . this is how we have to do it . Let 's just deal with her . I hear you whispering . Planning on stealing something ? we 're not . Plan on murdering me in my sleep ? What ? No ! Mrs. Jones ? Mrs. Jones ? Crazy lady . You trying to steal my things ? I actually wanted to talk with you . you don 't understand . in this region . It 's not safe ! Leave now ! The Lord is my shepherd . could we talk calmly for a second ? I 'm a teacher . Mrs. Jones ? my God . shut the windows and the doors ! Alma ? Alma ? Alma ? Jess ? froggie ! yeah . Wait . How old do you think he is ? Is he a baby ? I think he 's a baby . He 's so tiny . I didn 't know frogs could be like that . he got water on my shoe . Isn 't this a cool house ? we could make it look so pretty . froggie . Alma ? Elliot . Sounds like you 're right here . Alma . Why ? Mrs. Jones just died . Close the windows . Jess ! Is everything closed ? Yes . Elliot ? It 's happening here . It could be the grass and the trees are doing this now . She was alone when it happened . Seems like they might have gotten more sensitive . isn 't it ? Yes . isn 't it ? I wish you were here . too . You remember our first date ? You were so quiet . You bought me the mood ring . It turned purple when you wore it . " That means you 're in love . didn 't it ? and it turned out that purple meant I was horny . You loved that . I had no idea . right ? Right . What color was love ? I don 't remember . neither . Elliot ? Yeah ? I was just making sure you 're there . It 's not right for it to end like this . I want to be with you . and I 'm gonna come and be with you . don 't ! The event must have ended before we went out there . I found the hair clip ! You don 't want to be late for the first day schools are open . wait . I 'm just gonna put this right here . Okay ? Aunt Alma . I love you . too . Come here . okay ? Bye . traces of the neurotoxin have been found in some plants and trees . most environmentalists feel this happened on land . plants and trees just can 't pick up and move like other species . to rapidly evolve their chemistry . Well . on a Tuesday at 8 : 33 and then ended so suddenly at 9 : 27 the next morning . and we 'll never fully understand it . there 's been a lot of speculation as to why this happened in the Northeast only . How do you explain that ? okay ? like the first spot of a rash . We have become a threat to this planet . I don 't think anybody will argue that . And this is a warning . A warning ? I think the skeptics would believe that if it had occurred anywhere else . That 's why most people believe it was the government . we could all believe what you 're saying . I should drop my bicycle off at the apartment before I go to work . Can you make Nadia 's party tonight ? I should drop my bicycle off at the apartment before I go to work . That frightened me . I should drop my bicycle off What ? My God . My bicycle .

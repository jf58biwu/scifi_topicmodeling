 Previously on the 4400 ... A comet cannot change course . - This one has . - Then it 's not a comet . We 're not sure what 's just happened . There appears to be something out there . The light is gone , and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared . Diana Skouris . Tom Baldwin . You two will be one of the teams that 's responsible for investigating what happened to the returnees . We 're letting them go . We 're letting them go ? We don 't have a legal right to hold them . Why disappear a little girl from the 1940s , hold her for 60 years , and then send her back with the ability to predict the future ? - Can i go home ? - Home ? With you . I don 't like being here alone . Shawn Farrell ... Uncle Tommy . Hi . He 's all yours . Hey , what about Kyle ? Kyle 's in a coma , Shawn . What the hell did you do to Kyle ?

The incidents themselves are just catalysts for change . I swear to god . I 'll ask you one more time ... Where 's my son ? - Kyle ! Kyle ! - No ! Tom , don 't ! You 're not my son . Who are you ? What are you ? I 'm human . I come from a different time . Your future . In my time , humanity is dying out . Only those we took can prevent the catastrophe from happening . That 's why they 've been altered and seeded back into the timeline . You mean it 's all going to end ? - You have to help them . - Help them ? How ? Dad ? Kyle ... I intend to provide a safe haven for any 4400 in this country who needs one . You goddamn freak ! Danny , stop it ! Stop blaming me for nikki ! I guess what i 'm asking is if i could stay here for awhile . Tell me a little more about this ... ability of yours . I wasn 't pregnant when i was abducted , but i was when i got back . That baby could be the key to the future , and it has to be protected , and i can do that . Go ahead ! Run ! I will find you . That baby belongs with me . Isabelle ... Isabelle ... What is it , baby ? Bad dream ? Same one . She 's fine , richard . We 're all fine . Come back to bed . It 's probably just a raccoon ... Who was it ? They took off before i could ask . They left something behind . Someone tracked us down . Who ? NTAC ? Collier ? This look like their calling card to you ? I don 't know who it is , but someone knows we 're 4400s . Start packing . I 'll drive into town tomorrow morning to pick up my last paycheck , and then we 're out of here . Can 't we just go now ? We 're gonna need that money , Lily . Mr. and Mrs. Sumlin . Peter . If you 'll follow me . Forgive our appearance . As you know , the Center doesn 't officially open until tomorrow . Peter doesn 't have time to wait . That 's where you 're wrong , Mrs. Sumlin . Peter has all the time in the world . Hi , peter . My name is Jordan Collier . Just this way . Our medical lab isn 't quite ready , so we thought Peter would be more comfortable up here . Hello , Peter . I 'm Shawn . What do you say we get started ? Yeah ? Okay , buddy . I want you to take my hands . Try to relax . Okay ? You 're okay . You 're doing good . You 're doing so good . It 's okay . Oh , my god . Is he okay ? He 's fine . Just watch . It 's okay . You 're okay . You 're okay . Peter ? How do you feel , honey ? Son ? Thank you for your generous donation . We tried everything . Radiation , bone marrow transplants ... Is he really cured ? Take him back to his doctor . Run some tests . Peter 's leukemia is gone . This is a miracle . For now , it has to remain a private miracle . May i remind you that the confidentiality agreement you 've signed is strictly binding . But people should know about that young man . And they will . In time , they 'll know everything . Very nice . Floating the five . Floating the five . - You nervous ? - Aren 't you ? No , not at all . Well , maybe a little bit . Okay . A lot . Now , you really want to do this , right ? Right . Let 's go . Okay . Says here she registered an ability under the dinstman-lenhoff bill . Some kind of precognitive insight ? Yes , her visions stopped about four months ago . We 're not sure why . Oh , too bad . I was going to ask if Teledex will hit its quarterly projection . Well , we 'd like to get started , if that 's all right . Certainly . If you 'll just sign where indicated . Diana Skouris , Your adoption of maia rutledge is hereby complete , Legal , and binding . So witnessed by me , Henry Biederman , 10th circuit family court of Seattle . You know , some of us have to look far and wide to find the people we 'll call " family . " You two had to look clear across time . Diana , let me introduce you t o your daughter Maia . Maia , say hello to mommy . I 'm not doing it . I mean it this time . No way . It 's just a cat scan , Kyle . You 've had them before . This one 's gonna tell them the same thing the last 150 told them ... nothing . There 's nobody in here but me . I know that , and sooner or later , they 're going to stop looking . When ? When ? I wish i knew , But with NTAC , the Government , they 've got bigger issues than you or me , okay ? Just ... Kyle , they 're still trying to make sense about what happened that night at Highland Beach . That 's all . They 're afraid if they let me out I 'm gonna spill the beans about their big secret ? Well , they can relax , because i just want to get out of here and be normal again , and normal people don 't go around sounding off about future humans and the end of the world . Besides , I don 't even remember what happened . I know . You listening ? I don 't remember ! Just calm down . Just calm down . Dad , get me out of here . Talk to someone . Anyone . Please , ' cause ... Shh . Okay , okay . Okay Okay . Okay . Tom . Been awhile , huh ? Yeah , you know how it is . Us desk jockeys don 't have much cause to mingle with you hot-shot field agents . Someone feeling a little sorry for himself today ? " The path to oblivion starts here . " The 4400 were sent back to save humanity , and i 'm supposed to help them . I was there on the beach , remember ? They gave me a mission , and what 's my biggest accomplishment of the week ? I convinced my son to take another cat scan . Somehow , I don 't think that 's what they had in mind . Diana , you ready to roll ? In a minute . It 's just we have to check in on three more returnees . I want to make sure we get our reports in by 5 : 00 . Okay , why don 't you keep the car warmed up ? And i 'll be right there . You bet . Vic Hubbard 's the best lead investigator you could find ? Oh , no , he 's the fourth one this year . Two more , I break a record . We 've got to get you out from behind that desk . I 'm lucky to have a job here . I put a gun to another agent 's head , remember ? Yeah , well , I never said it was going to be easy . It 's obvious what really happened . Are you going to start in with your negative energy again ? White holes . See , they 're the answer . That 's how they took them , and that 's how they brought them back . - Yeah , but white holes ... the second law of ... - Yeah , because I 'm right . Come on , come on . - Guys ! - What 's it like to not be right ? Am I interrupting ? Brady 's back on his " white hole " kick again . Well , one day you 'll explain to me the difference between the white ones and the black ones , right ? Well , how about tonight ? How about you just give me that thing that we discussed ? - Can 't . - Why not ? I already sent it upstairs . I wonder if anyone 's read it yet . When they do , I 'm sure you 'll hear about it . I owe you one , handsome . H. P. Lovecraft 's The Mountains of Madness . Are you trying to tell me something ? Which orderly did you steal it from ? Matt ? Arlo ? You 're so sweet . You 're the only person here who doesn 't want me dead . I wish I could take you with me when I go , but I can 't . They only want me . But I 'll be leaving soon . Very soon . Joanne ? Paul ? What are you doing ? Sex maniac . Don 't go flashing those bedroom eyes at me . Joanne , I 'm serious . Put that stuff down before you hurt yourself . We 're building something . I can see that . Can you really ? It 's gonna be gigantic . Humongous . Rival the pyramids . But some things are better left to the imagination , Joanne . Besides , you two have physical therapy now . Let 's go . Building something ... Building nothing . Help me get rid of this junk . You wanted to see me , Nina ? Are you sleeping with Tom Baldwin ? Should I come back in ? Maybe we could start over ... Answer the question . Never even held hands . Do you owe him money ? Okay , what game are we playing here ? Because if I knew the rules ... I am playing the theory room paper game . - I don 't know that one . - Well , let me give you a hint . " The necessity for the immediate reassignment of Thomas Baldwin to active field duty . " Catchy title . Did you come up with it yourself , or did the big brains in the basement pitch in ? Let 's just say that I agree with the sentiment . Tom is the best agent i 've ever worked with , maybe the best you 've got in this division . In the three months that baldwin was investigating the 4400 , this department learned more , far more , than it has in the entire year he 's been shuffling paper . He threatened another agent 's life . He was trying to protect his son , who these future people , whoever they are , chose as their spokesman . That 's not to mention that his nephew Shawn is one of the 4400 . All of which sound like major conflicts of interest to me . That 's not what Dennis Ryland believed . Dennis Ryland is no longer in charge here . Maybe you should call Washington and talk to him . I don 't have to call washington . They 've got me on speed dial . Congressmen , senators , committee chairs , subcommittee chairs , all of them looking to this department , to me , for answers . Which is why you can 't keep an agent like Tom Baldwin on the shelf . He 's a major player in this case . He 's maybe the major player . See , funny , that 's exactly what it says in this paper . Maybe Marco had me check it for typos . Uh , the next time that you want to send me a message , put your own name on it . Mr. Walcott ! Get down from there ! Arlo ! Mr. Walcott , get down from there ! Arlo ! You heard the man ! Mr. Walcott , Get down from there this instant ! I 'm calling security if you don 't come down right now . Arlo ! This is your last chance . What the hell are you doing up there ? I got it . Arlo ! Arlo , this is your last warning . Arlo , please ! Be careful ! I 'm coming down . Arlo , be careful ! Watch what you 're doing . I got it . I got it . Oh , oh ... oh , my god . Oh , my god ! No ! Lily , I 'm home . Lily , relax . We don 't have to leave . Some nut papered the entire town with these things . He wasn 't singling us out . Well , I still think we should go . I was scared last night too , but did you read this ? It 's a rant , not a witch hunt . Maybe , but Richard , we still don 't feel safe here anymore . You mean Isabelle doesn 't feel safe . Richard , we 've gone over this a dozen times . I don 't know why she talks to me and not to you . " talks ? " Communicates . Whatever . Did she happen to mention where we should go ? Does she have a place picked out , or will she know it when she sees it ? We can find a town . We already did . Right here . Isabelle is six months old . I know she 's a special kid , but we 're still her parents . We make decisions for her . She doesn 't make them for us . I know . It 's time we get out of here . You 're right . You 're absolutely right . We 're staying put . Sign this . What is it ? Your letter of resignation . I thought I was being reassigned to field duty . You are Effective immediately . I need results . We have a high-priced collection of sheepskin in the basement that tells me you 're the best way to get them . So i 'm willing to take a risk . But I need some insurance . This . I left the date blank . You cross the line , I fill it in . Fair enough . Good . Here . Look at this . Tess Doerner . Diagnose of paranoïd schizophrenia at the age of 15 . Disapeared from Abendson Psychiatric Hospital in April of 1955 . Let me guess , they sent her back without bothering to cure her ? Curing people was not part of their agenda . We just got a call from the C. A. over the hospital . One of their orderlies is dead . He claims that there 's some kind of connection . We 'll check it out . Hold on . There 's still one piece of business we need to get straight . You 're setting conditions ? This is your new house ? It 's yours too . Well , all your stuff is here . I ... Kind of looks like your old place , huh ? Well , I tried , anyway . Only one thing missing , Mom . Yeah I know . Sometimes I can 't believe she 's not here either . But we tried , Kyle , you know , we ... we really tried to make it work . I wish you both would have tried a little harder . I 'm sorry , it 's just ... You know , when something terrible happens to a family , like when you were in the hospital , it can ... bring people closer together or ... drive them apart . Your mom and me ... I 'll have to call her , let her know I 'm out the quarantine . Yeah , you should do that . You know , it 'd make her really happy ... Shawn is gonna freak out too . What ? You know I 'm gonna see him , right ? You 're a good cousin . Just don 't expect too much . You know , people change in four years . I can 't believe you 're standing here . I ... I 've been looking forward to this moment for too long . Hey ... You remember how we used to love to go to the batting cages ? You never could hit that curve ball . Me ? No , it was you , And I got plenty of quarters saved up , so ... Maybe we should stop off at the driving range too . You want to learn how to play golf ? I used to beg to teach you ! Lot of things I want to try now , dad . You make a list . You want it , and we 'll do it . Anything . You can show me tonight , okay ? You 're leaving ? I just got here ! That 's my job , buddy . Now , get started on that list . You people really take your arts and crafts seriously , don 't you ? You 're sure Tess drew this before they started building ? Ske made her first sketch 2 weeks ago . That thing started going up yesterday . And you think that the orderly who died is connected to all of this ? Arlo was on the ledge of " B " building prying loose a weather vane . I believe it was this weather vane . So why don 't you just confine all the other patients to their rooms ? Well , i 've been tempted , but this kind of cooperative behavior , it 's unheard of with these illnesses . Besides , I wanted you to get a look at that thing before we tore it down again . It 's all right , Kevin . They 're just here to talk to Tess . He 's very protective of her . She 's his only friend in here . Really , it 's okay . I 'll just let her know you 're coming . Great . We saw some of the pictures you did , Tess . They 're really good . They 'll hear you . There 's microphones in the walls . They broadcast by sattellite to the submarines . Who does ? The doctors . The doctors here in the hospital ? Some of them are in the hospital . Some of them are stationed on the submarine . All right , we 'll just talk really softly . They took my crayons away , but they 're too late . Yeah ? Why 's that ? Because it 's gonna get built anyway . They want me to get in touch with them , that 's why they put the plans in my head . Huh , now , are we talking about the doctors here in the hospital or the doctors under the sea ? Neither We 're talking about the people who took me stupid . So the people who took you ... they want the patients here to build that tower ? They 'll do anything to get me back . They like me . Did you ask the other patients for help , Tess ? I don 't like talking t them . They 're crazy . Was Arlo crazy ? I never thought he was ... but maybe crazy is catching . He was dictating a letter . I don 't know what happened . He just grabbed his head and started screaming . Wait outside . Now . Hold still . Hold still . Thanks . Thank you . They 're getting worse . Jordan ... They 're coming more often too . - You 're okay ? - I 'm fine I don 't get it . I don 't get why these attacks keep coming back . I 've cured ... emphysema , leukemia ... broken bones ... That baby really kicked your ass . Well , you just remember that when we find Richard and Lily . You sound pretty confident , Jordan , but it 's been a year . Sometimes I forget they 're still out there . I never forget , and neither do the men I 'm paying to find them . Okay , but if I were you , I wouldn 't want to be in the same time zone as that kid . If you two meet up again , it might just finish you off . I have my reasons . In the breaking news , revelation about the origins of the 4400 . In his newly published autobiography , former real estate mogul , Jordan Collier , claims that the 4400 were abducted by human beings , from the future . The book contains copies of classified government memoranda , that Collier says prove his claims . The documents are said to come from an anonymous source within the national threat assessment command . According to Collier , the 4400 were returned to avert a catastrophe that threatens the survival of mankind . Why didn 't you tell me ? Collier charges that the government has had this information for more than a year , but has kept it secret in an effort to avert a public panic . The government claims that the documents are purely speculative and have been quoted out of context . Don 't care who took them . Don 't care who sent them back . The government should have kept them behind bars . Didn 't you hear what the man said ? They 're here to save the world . What do you expect him to say ? He 's one of them . You 're awful quiet . I deal in facts ... And the fact is , I 've got to flush this radiator before lunch . You 'll be happy to hear that M. Collier 's anonymous source is anonymous no more . Agent Hubbard will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law . So , what about Collier ? Guy bought national secrets on the black market . I 'm sure we 'd all like to see Collier charged with treason , but it 's unlikely . I doubt we 'll be able to trace the payments directly to him . Now , as for this so-called " 4400 Center " , Round-the-clock surveillance is in effect until further notice . I want pictures of everyone who comes within a hundred yards of that place . Is it true that Collier 's filing for tax-exempt status ? Apparently . He 's turning the 4400 into some kind of religion ? More like a cult . Well , " cult " is what the big congregation calls the little congregation . Cult , religion , whatever . What 's he basing it on ? Have you read this thing ? Collier claims that he can unlock the 4400 within anybody . So he expects a guy punching a clock in Pittsburgh to believe he has some kind of latent superpower ? Most of the 4400 don 't even have those kinds of abilities . Not yet , anyway . No , but if you thought there was a chance that you had an ability locked away inside you ... You sound like you 're ready to sign up . No , but I wouldn 't blame anyone for being curious . We keep telling the public that biologically , the 4400 aren 't any different than the rest of us . They haven 't been altered genetically , neurologically ... As far as we can tell . But if Collier thinks people are just going to sign their lives and their life savings over to some ... metaphysical pyramid scheme , then ... He 's in for a rude awakening . Welcome to the Center . My name 's Devon . - What 's yours ? - Kyle . Nice to meet you , Kyle . Can I sign you up for a tour ? Huh , thanks . I 'm just looking for my cousin , Shawn Farrell ? I 'm sorry , M. Farrell 's not available right now . Could you tell him Kyle 's looking for him ? He does live here , right ? I 'm afraid policy prohibits me from discussing our membership . I 'm not looking for a discussion . I just want to say hi to my cousin . If you 'd like to leave your name and number ... I 'm not leaving anything ! What 's the problem here ? There 's no problem . Then tell Shawn I 'm here ! If he doesn 't want to see me , fine , but that 's up to him , right ? Would you lower your voice , please ? Look , I 've got nothing against you . Personally , I hope the pod people return your body to you someday . If it 's all the same , I 'll find Shawn myself . This way , sir . - Get your hands off me ! - You have to leave . You guys didn 't tell me this thing was so big . - It wasn 't . - Not yesterday . And those don 't look like patients to me . They 're not . Dr. Clayton ! I know what you 're going to say . We 're falling behind . We 'll make up the time this afternoon . So is the entire hospital working on this thing ? It 's the only way to get it done . Excuse me . Uh , Randy , Winston , we need a little help here . Dr. Cho 's back there with the satellite dish . Okay . So first the patients , now the staff . If this is some kind of mass hysteria , it 's spreading . This is outrageous ! We have work to finish here . Important work . The doctors want to work . Tell them to make their rounds . No one 's stopping them from taking care of their patients . Now on , - the tower and the courtyard are off-limits , you got it ? - Got it . Man , look at the size of that thing . Wouldn 't mind having one of those in my backyard , huh ? Road trip 's over . Wait in the car . So yesterday , a few patients were compelled to work on this thing , and today it 's the entire hospital . If we get Tess out of here , do you think this compulsion will fade ? I don 't know . It 's worth a try , isn 't it ? All right , I got you . It 's okay . I 'm not a bad person . I 'm not . No , no , no one 's saying you are , Tess . Then why are you going to stick wires in my brain ? I promise , Tess . No one 's going to hurt you . That 's what everyone says , right before they hurt you . Why am I being punished ? I 'm a good person . Really . I 'm only doing what they want . Guys ! Guys ! Get over here ! Kevin ! Okay , Tess . Let 's go . Come on . - It 's all right . - Kevin ... I just got the full medical workup on Tess . Let me guess ... Physically normal across the board . You can say this for the 4400 ... They 're consistent . Tess draws a picture of a ... a tower , or a monument ... Yeah , or a beacon ... And the people around her drop everything and start building it . Well , they can 't help themselves . They have to work . It 's like ants . Come here . The queen secretes a chemical , tells the other ants what to do . The drones don 't stop working until the job is done . Doesn 't matter if one of them dies , or if a storm comes and washes away the anthill . They just keep working ... Unless you take the queen away . Let 's hope our drones respond the same way . Right , so the future sent back a schizophrenic queen ant with a blueprint for what , some interstellar walkie-talkie ? Let 's see what Tess can tell us . We 'd just better not get too close , because if your theory 's right , anyone who gets exposed to her could be vulnerable . All right , I 'll talk to Tess . You check in with Garrity at the hospital . These friends of yours , the ones who took you , what do you think they want to talk about ? They 're so much smarter than you , it isn 't even funny . Yeah , well ... Yeah , I don 't doubt it . I mean , they figured out how to take you and how to send you back . Sending me back was a mistake , and they know it . I 'm supposed to be there . Where exactly is " there ? " There were doctors there too . They were nice . All of them . They were nice . You remember where you were taken ? We slept a lot , but not all the time . We wore gray clothes . There was a giant building . The doctors wore shiny jackets . I miss it so much . Go on . I really like hearing you talk about it . Our rooms had round windows . High doorways with arches in them . The stones had writing in them . Math symbols or something , inscriptions , jars of purplish metals , and rods with stained tips . These symbols , Tess , what did they look like ? Tess ? Tess , do you remember what the inscriptions said ? They 're waiting to hear from me . I need to get in touch with them . Tess . Tess . Just wait ... Tess , just wait . Garrity , why haven 't you been picking up your cellphone ? I 'm sorry . It 's been kind of crazy down here . So is everything all right ? Yeah . Fine . We 're just about done here . Done ? Well , the satellite dishes are a bitch to hook up , but we 'll get ' em . Come on , people . Let 's get those dishes secured . We don 't have all day . I just had the most unbelievable conversation with Tess . Well , it couldn 't have been any more unbelievable than the one I just had with Garrity . Can 't say I see it that way . No other way to see it . That book is blasphemy . Well , don 't buy it if that 's how you feel . " The third angel blew his trumpet , and a great star fell from heaven , burning like a torch . " Revelations 8 : 10 . I 'll take your word for it . The day they came back was the beginning of the end times . Sounds like you 've done a little more thinking on it than I have . Either remove the book from the store , or my boy here will remove it for you . Like hell he will ! Do you know what you 're carrying there , woman ? It 's just a book . It 's the doorway to hell . That child yours ? That 's my daughter . Abomination begets abomination . Richard ! What 's going on ? We 've got to get out of here . Now . Ok ... Sheriff , what 's the hell happen ? These new guys you sent us are no good . Park told me he had experience with a welding torch . Experience at what ? Starting fires ? Now our schedule 's in the toilet . Did either of you call the fire department ? Time to go .

 * * * VERIDIAN DYNAMICS IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES IN THE WORLD . TO MAKE IT HERE , YOU HAVE TO BE VERY COMPETITIVE . SOME COMPETE TO SEE WHO HAS THE BIGGEST ROCKET . OTHERS COMPETE TO SEE WHO CAN BE THE FASTEST . BUT NO ONE 'S MORE COMPETITIVE THAN ME AND VERONICA . RACE YOU TO THE ELEVATOR ? FEELIN ' LUCKY ? BUT IT 'S THAT DRIVE TO WIN THAT KEEPS US AT THE TOP OF OUR GAME . I WIN ! THIS IS THE MOST FUN ANYONE HAS EVER HAD WITH HYPODERMIC NEEDLES . IT 'S NOT OVER YET . IT 'S STILL WOBBLING . AND IT CAN 'T COME OUT FOR AT LEAST A MINUTE ... SAME RULES AS FOR LOSING YOUR VIRGINITY . WOULD YOU TWO SAY THAT YOU WERE OVERLY CONCERNED WITH THE OUTRAGEOUS PRICES OF STORE-BOUGHT WRAPPING PAPER ? YES , WE 'RE SO CONCERNED , WE NEED TO BE ALONE RIGHT NOW . MY DAUGHTER IS SELLING WRAPPING PAPER TO RAISE MONEY FOR HER SCHOOL . WHOEVER SELLS THE MOST WINS A TRIP TO DISNEYLAND . SECOND PLACE GETS TO CRY WHILE ROSE AND I GO TO DISNEYLAND . UH , PHIL WILL TAKE TEN ROLLS . WHAT ? YOU HEARD HIM . I 'D LEAVE NOW BEFORE HE CHANGES HIS MIND . AND , LEM , I 'LL ALSO PUT YOU DOWN FOR TEN . ONE FOR EACH TIME I TOLD YOU NOT TO PLAY THE NEEDLE GAME . TED KNOWS EVERYTHING WE DO . HE 'S LIKE A GOD , ONLY IT HURTS MORE WHEN HE JUDGES US . HEY , DO YOU GUYS HAVE THE SPECS FOR THE SOLAR-POWERED OVENS ? I HATE COMING DOWN HERE . SORRY . DON 'T WORRY . AH . WE ONLY PLAY THE CLEAN NEEDLE GAME WITH CLEAN NEEDLES . HERE 'S A BAND-AID . AND THERE 'S YOUR LADY SHOULDER . JUST BRING THE SPECS TO MY DESK . I 'LL BE THE ONE HOPING I NEVER HEAR THE TERM " LADY SHOULDER " EVER AGAIN . WAIT . I THOUGHT WE USED THE LAST OF THE BAND-AIDS WHEN YOU WANTED TO SEE WHAT I 'D LOOK LIKE WITH A MOUSTACHE . THESE AREN 'T BAND-AIDS . THIS IS THAT EXPERIMENTAL ENERGY PATCH . WE JUST DRUGGED LINDA . I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY , PHIL . WHEN WE SET OUT TO MAKE AN ENERGY PATCH LOOK EXACTLY LIKE A BAND-AID , I SAID IT COULDN 'T BE DONE . I WAS WRONG . WE SHOULD TELL HER . OR WE DON 'T TELL HER SO SHE DOESN 'T GET MAD AT US AGAIN . I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING . WE 'RE GOING . THAT 'S IT . IT WENT . YEAH . SHE 'S JUST GONNA HAVE A LITTLE EXTRA ENERGY . WHY TROUBLE HER WITH SOMETHING THAT MIGHT FORCE HER TO YELL AT US AGAIN ? WE 'RE DOING HER A FAVOR . THAT 'S WHAT 'S HAPPENING HERE . SO WE 'RE EVEN . EVEN ? SHE OWES US . AS YOU ALL KNOW , WE 'VE BEEN WORKING ON VERIDIAN 'S NEW SOLAR-POWERED OVENS . WE 'VE HAD A GREAT AMOUNT OF SUCCESS WITH IT SO FAR . IF YOU GUYS WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHART , THESE ... WE 'RE WORKING ON A CONTRACT FOR SOLAR-POWERED OVENS , WHICH THE MILITARY PLANS TO AIR-DROP INTO REMOTE VILLAGES AS A GOODWILL GESTURE . IT 'LL BE THE ONLY THING THE MILITARY DROPS THAT DOESN 'T KILL PEOPLE . THE PROBLEM IS ... IT KILLS PEOPLE . YEAH , THE PLASTIC WE 'RE USING LEACHES TOXINS INTO FOOD . HOWEVER , THE TOXINS ARE ONLY RELEASED WHEN THE OVENS ARE EXPOSED TO SUNLIGHT . WHICH IS THE ONLY TIME SOLAR OVENS WORK . SOME DAYS , IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING WE DO LEACHES TOXINS . WELL , LUCKILY , IT CAN BE FIXED . OF COURSE IT CAN . WE CAN DO ANYTHING , BECAUSE THIS IS THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC TEAM THAT 'S EVER BEEN ASSEMBLED . LET 'S DO IT ! WHERE IS SHE GOING ? TO DO IT ? HUH . ANYWAY , THE SOLAR OVENS CAN BE FIXED BY USING A MORE EXPENSIVE MATERIAL . NOW THE , UH , PLASTIC IN OUR BOMB CASINGS IS COMPLETELY HARMLESS . WELL , IT 'S NICE TO KNOW PEOPLE CAN SAFELY EAT OFF OUR UNEXPLODED BOMBS . THANK YOU , EVERYONE . HANG ON . WE HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM . IS THIS ABOUT THE WRAPPING PAPER ? NO , THIS IS ABOUT A LITTLE GIRL 'S DREAM TO SELL THE MOST WRAPPING PAPER , A DREAM THAT IS NOW BEING CHALLENGED BY SOME INSANELY COMPETITIVE GIRL NAMED CYNTHIA . DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK THAT MAYBE YOU 'RE THE INSANELY COMPETITIVE ONE ? LET ME REPHRASE THAT . I 'D LIKE FIVE MORE ROLLS , PLEASE . TED , SINCE THE MILITARY DOESN 'T USUALLY PAY MORE FOR SOMETHING THAT KILLS FEWER PEOPLE , I NEED YOU TO BUTTER UP GENERAL McMILLAN OVER DINNER AND GET SOME EXTRA MONEY OUT OF THEM . OH , MAN . CAN 'T WE JUST HOPE THEY DON 'T LOOK AT THE INVOICE ? COME ON . THE GENERAL RESPECTS YOU , TED ... YOUR EXPERIENCE , YOUR CHARM , THE WHOLE PACKAGE . OH , AND YOUR PACKAGE . IT 'S TRUE . I HAD CAUGHT THE GENERAL 'S EYE . AND HE WAS AN OFFICER , BUT NO GENTLEMAN . I ALWAYS ENJOY DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU , TED . * * * LOOK , I LIKE THE GENERAL , AND I LIKE GAY PEOPLE ... DONE . WAIT . I JUST DON 'T THINK IT 'S RIGHT TO FLIRT FOR THE SAKE OF A DEAL . BESIDES , HE 'S SO GRABBY . I MEAN , WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO ROMANCE ? WHAT IF I WERE TO HELP YOU SELL YOUR DAUGHTER 'S PRECIOUS TOILET PAPER ? IT 'S WRAPPING PAPER . IT 'S NOT MY FAULT I DON 'T LISTEN WHEN YOU TALK . BUT FINE , WHATEVER . I CAN SELL ANYTHING , TED . I ONCE SOLD A GUY ON HAVING DINNER WITH A GRABBY GENERAL TO HELP HIS DAUGHTER WIN A CONTEST . REALLY , WHO ? BECAUSE I HAVEN 'T AGREED TO THAT YET . YOU WILL . YOU 'RE THAT COMPETITIVE . FINE . IT 'S A DEAL . IF ROSE WINS , I WILL HAVE DINNER WITH THE GENERAL . BUT IF HE TRIES THAT " LADY AND THE TRAMP " SPAGHETTI THING AGAIN , I 'M OUTTA THERE . MM. PHIL AND LEM REALIZED LINDA HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH ENERGY FOR HER OWN GOOD , SO THEY HAD TO TAKE ACTION ... COWARDLY ACTION . WE NEED OUR BAND-AID BACK . WHAT ? THAT 'S GROSS . WHY DO YOU WANT IT BACK ? BECAUSE IT 'S OURS . YEAH . WE WERE JUST LOANING IT TO YOU . OKAY , YOU CAN HAVE IT BACK ... BUT YOU GOTTA CATCH ME FIRST . OOH ! * * * * * * GOT IT ! * * * SO I SOLD 50 ROLLS . VERONICA SOLD 20 ROLLS . AND YOU SOLD ... SIX . I ONLY KNOW , LIKE , THREE GROWN-UPS . YOU KNOW , YOU 'RE KIND OF A FREAK ABOUT COMPETITION , DAD . COMPETITION 'S IMPORTANT , HONEY . IT MOTIVATES PEOPLE TO DO THEIR VERY BEST . BESIDES , YOU WON 'T BE CALLING ME A FREAK WHEN I 'M WEARING MY PLUTO HAT SPINNING IN A TEACUP . WAIT A MINUTE . THIS CYNTHIA CHARACTER HAS SOLD 15 MORE ROLLS THAN US . WHO IS THIS GIRL ? SHE 'S NEW . YOU CAN CLICK ON HER NAME TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HER . LET 'S DO THAT . IF YOU WANT TO CRUSH YOUR COMPETITION , WHICH I ... WE ... DO , YOU WANT TO GET TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM , HOW THEY THINK , WHAT THEIR INTERESTS ARE ... WHAT KIND OF WHEELCHAIR THEY 'RE CONFINED TO . * * * * * * COMPETITION ... WHETHER IT 'S ANIMALS OR THIS OLD WOMAN AND BABY , FIGHTING TO THE DEATH ... COMPETITION MAKES US STRONGER . IN BUSINESS , THAT MEANS BETTER PRODUCTS ... PILLS THAT LOOK LIKE CANDY , HANDS THAT CAN SHOOT LIGHTNING AND A NEW GENERATION OF HURRICANE-PROOF DOGS ... WE HAVE A PROBLEM . CYNTHIA , OUR COMPETITION IN THE WRAPPING PAPER CONTEST , IS IN A WHEELCHAIR . OOH . YEAH , THAT IS A PROBLEM . IT GIVES HER A HUGE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE . WE 'RE GONNA HAVE TO STEP IT UP . WAIT . YOU DON 'T THINK COMPETING ALL-OUT AGAINST A GIRL WHO 'S DISABLED IS WRONG ? WRONG ? HOW SHOULD I KNOW WHAT 'S WRONG ? I 'M NOT SOME GREEK PHILOSOPHER . WHAT DOES ROSE THINK ? AH , SHE 'S NO HELP . I TAUGHT HER EVERYONE SHOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY . WELL , THEN TREAT EVERYONE EQUALLY . NO , YOU 'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO REALLY DO THAT . YOU 'RE JUST SUPPOSED TO TEACH IT . TED , YOU 'RE A COMPETITOR . YOU WANT TO WIN . YOU JUST NEED TO HEAR IT 'S OKAY . NO , I DON 'T . BUT IT IS , RIGHT ? YES , WE SHOULD TREAT THIS CYNTHIA EQUALLY AND BEAT THE ... DOES SHE WEAR PANTS ? I THINK SO . THEN LET 'S BEAT THEM OFF HER . WAIT . YOU JUST WANT ROSE TO WIN SO THAT I 'LL GO HAVE DINNER WITH GENERAL McMILLAN . GOD , IT 'S LIKE YOU 'RE OBSESSED WITH THE GUY . TED , YOU 'VE GOT TO FOCUS . THIS IS ABOUT SELLING SOLAR OVENS , NOT YOUR LOVE LIFE . LINDA 'S CRYING . WELL , WE GOT THE PATCH OFF HER , SO WE 'RE GOOD . STILL , SHE 'S CRYING , AND WE LIKE HER , SO ... WE SHOULD SEE WHAT 'S WRONG . HEY , LINDA . WHAT 'S WRONG ? THE JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE HAD SUCH A TUMULTUOUS HISTORY . AND YET THEY WERE STILL ABLE TO GIVE US THIS ? THE EVERYTHING BAGEL ... IT 'S ALL YOU 'D EVER WANT IN ONE BAGEL . I LOVE IT ... AND THE CHOSEN PEOPLE WHO CREATED IT . OH , I HAVE BEEN SO EMOTIONAL LATELY . WELL , MAYBE IT 'S JUST ... WHY DON 'T YOU SHUT UP AND STOP TRYING TO ANALYZE ME ? DO YOU THINK WILDLY ERRATIC EMOTIONS COULD BE A RESIDUAL EFFECT OF THE ENERGY PATCH ? HARD TO TELL . THIS IS THE PROBLEM WHEN THE COMPANY WILL ONLY PAY FOR TESTING ON DRUNK FRAT GUYS . SO WHAT DO WE DO ? I DON 'T KNOW . WE COULD JUST STAND HERE WITHOUT A PLAN . I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING . I CAN GIVE YOU 6 ROLLS FOR $ 5 A ROLL . WHOA . THAT 'S CRAZY . WHY , THAT 'S WELL BELOW THE CURRENT WHOLESALE PRICE . TOO LATE . SHE PROMISED . I 'M GETTING MY CHECKBOOK . WE WORK WELL TOGETHER . LIKE BATMAN AND ... I 'M BATMAN . WELL , IT WAS MY IDEA . I THINK ... I 'M BATMAN AND ROBIN . HI , GUYS . HI , BEST-LOOKING WOMAN IN THE COMPANY , POSSIBLY THE UNIVERSE . HELLO , PERSON WHO CLEARLY WANTS SOMETHING FROM ME . I DO WANT SOMETHING FROM YOU . I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU GOT TO BE SO FREAKIN ' AWESOME . LOOK AT YOU ... YOU GOT IT ALL GOING ON . YOUaposRE AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL WOMAN , YOU ARE SO PRETTY . AND YOUR CALVES ? OH . THEY 'RE LIKE GRANITE WRAPPED IN SILK . IS EVERYTHING OKAY , LINDA ? YOU JUST SAID A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF , ANY ONE OF WHICH WOULD BE DISTURBING ON ITS OWN . DISTURBING ? WELL , MAYBE YOU WOULDN 'T FIND ME DISTURBING IF I WAS MORE LIKE VERONICA . LOOK AT ME . I 'M MORE LIKE VERONICA . I 'M TILTING MY HEAD CURIOUSLY . I ONCE LEFT THE LADIES ROOM WITHOUT WASHING MY HANDS . THAT 'S RIGHT . I SAW YOU . CLEARLY SHE 'S LOST HER MIND . I WOULDN 'T BELIEVE A WORD SHE SAID PAST THAT CALF THING . OKAY , THERE 'S SOMETHING WE HOPED WE 'D NEVER HAVE TO TELL YOU . YOU KNOW HOW WHEN YOU ACCIDENTALLY DOSE SOMEONE , LIKE WITH AN EXPERIMENTAL ENERGY PATCH , AND YOU HOPE THEY 'LL SIT QUIETLY AT THEIR DESKS , BUT INSTEAD THEY WANDER AROUND DRAWING UNNECESSARY ATTENTION TO THEMSELVES ? WE 'VE DONE SOMETHING EERILY SIMILAR TO THAT . WHAT ? YOU BONEHEADS DOSED ME ? I COULD KILL YOU ! BUT THEN I WOULD MISS YOU SO MUCH . BASED ON THE DOSE SHE RECEIVED , WE 'RE CONFIDENT THE EFFECTS SHOULD WEAR OFF WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS . THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND FORGIVENESS . STOP . TURN BACK . DOSING ANEMPLOYEE IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE . I 'M VERONICA . I 'M SO SERIOUS , AND I HAVE PEE-PEE ON MY HANDS . I WASH MY HANDS , YOU DRUGGED UP FRUITCAKE . OKAY , HERE 'S WHAT 'S GONNA HAPPEN ... OKAY , HERE 'S WHAT 'S GONNA HAPPEN ... FIRST , WE 'RE GONNA CUT YOU A LOT OF SLACK AND HOPE YOU DON 'T SAY SOMETHING THAT GETS YOU FIRED . SECOND , PHIL AND LEM , YOU 'RE NOT GONNA LET LINDA OUT OF YOUR SIGHT UNTIL SHE 'S COMPLETELY BACK TO NORMAL . LOOK AT ME . I 'M LINDA . I 'M MAKING FUN OF EVERYONE . HEY . OH , GOOD . YOU 'RE STILL AWAKE . CRAZY DAY , BUT ... VERONICA AND I SOLD SO MUCH WRAPPING PAPER , NOT ONLY ARE YOU GOING TO DISNEYLAND , BUT MICKEY 'S GONNA BE WEARING YOUR EARS ON HIS HEAD . OH , WAIT . THAT 'S A HORRIFYING IMAGE . EVERYONE AT SCHOOL HATES ME BECAUSE I 'M BEATING THE DISABLED GIRL . BUT EVERYBODY 'S EQUAL . WE DON 'T SEE DISABLED PEOPLE . WELL , WE SEE THEM , WE JUST DON 'T CARE . WELL , WE CARE , WE JUST DON 'T TREAT THEM DIFFERENTLY . WELL , THEY DO HAVE THEIR OWN PARKING . CYNTHIA 'S HAD A REALLY HARD LIFE , AND EVERYONE ELSE IS LETTING HER WIN . IF I WIN , EVERYONE 'S GONNA BE SO MAD AT ME , WON 'T BE ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL ANYMORE . CAN WE NOT WIN , DADDY ? PLEASE . I KNOW IT 'S HARD FOR YOU . NO , IT 'S OKAY . WE 'LL LET CYNTHIA WIN . COME ON . MICKEY WILL WEAR HER EARS . THANK YOU , DADDY . COULD I SLEEP WITH THE LIGHT ON TONIGHT ? IT WAS THE EAR THING , WASN 'T IT ? LITTLE BIT . * * * THESE COOKIES ARE INEDIBLE . I MADE COOKIES ! YOU MADE COOKIES AN HOUR AGO . EAT THEM ! THIS IS SO MUCH FUN , HAVING A SLEEPOVER . WELL , TED WANTED US TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU , AND WHEN WE TRIED TO TAKE YOU TO MY HOUSE , YOU BIT ME , SO HERE WE ARE . THERE 'S A PENNY IN THIS COOKIE . JUST EAT IT . EAT IT . DON 'T GET HER MAD AGAIN . THERE 'S THAT BABY AGAIN . IT CRIES EVERY NIGHT . BABIES DO THAT . NOT TONIGHT THEY DON 'T . THIS ENDS NOW . LINDA , YOU CAN 'T HURT A BABY . WELL , YOU CAN HURT THEM . THEY 'RE NOT INDESTRUCTIBLE . I MEANT IT 'S MORALLY INDEFENSIBLE . WELL , WHAT IF THE BABY KILLED A MAN ? YOU AND YOUR MORAL PUZZLES . I JUST LOVE ' EM . ANSWER THE DOOR , BABY . I KNOW YOU 'RE IN THERE . I CAN HEAR YOU CRYING . LINDA , WHAT 'S GOING ON ? WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT STELLA ? STAY OUT OF THIS , KATHY . THIS IS BETWEEN ME AND THE BABY ... WHO IS JUST THE CUTEST THING IN THE WORLD . OH , MY GOD . LOOK AT YOU . HI , STELLA . CAN I HOLD HER ? PLEASE . I DON 'T THINK THAT 'S A GOOD IDEA . SO YOU 'RE SAYING UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD YOU HARM THE BABY HITLER ? HEY , FELLAS . LOOK WHAT I GOT ... A BABY . I 'M NAMING HER TED . THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF THING THE OTHER TED WANTED US TO PREVENT . LINDA ? LINDA ? THE NEXT MORNING , I TOLD VERONICA THAT WE HAD TO LET CYNTHIA WIN THE WRAPPING PAPER CONTEST . fontStyl = " italic " SHE TOOK IT BETTER THAN EXPECTED . YOU 'RE SOFT AND WEAK , TED , LIKE A GEISHA . ROSE IS BEING TEASED AT SCHOOL . SHE 'S FAR MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN A WRAPPING PAPER CONTEST . IF SHE WANTS ME TO STOP SELLING , I 'M STOPPING . FINE , QUIT . I DON 'T GIVE A CRAP . SO WHEN ARE YOU HAVING DINNER WITH THE GENERAL ? I 'M NOT , BECAUSE TECHNICALLY , I ONLY HAD TO DO THAT IF ROSE WON THE TRIP TO DISNEYLAND . IF SHE 'S NOT GONNA HAVE A MAGICAL EXPERIENCE , NEITHER IS THE GENERAL . WELL , IF ROSE HAS TO WIN FOR YOU TO HAVE THAT DINNER , THEN I 'M GONNA MAKE SURE ROSE WINS . THEN I 'M GONNA MAKE SURE SHE LOSES . THEN IT IS ON . IT 'LL BE LIKE TWO GREAT HEAVYWEIGHTS GOING TOE-TO-TOE , AND I 'M ALI AND FRAZIER AND FOREMAN . SURE , I COULD 'VE JUST AGREED TO HAVE DINNER WITH THE GENERAL TO END THIS THING , BUT I KNOW I CAN BEAT VERONICA . AT THE COMPANY PICNIC , I BEAT HER IN THE 3-LEGGED RACE . ALTHOUGH , WE BOTH LOST TO SOMETHING LEM AND PHIL CREATED IN THE LAB . I DON 'T GET IT . WHY DO YOU NEED TO BUY BACK ALL THE WRAPPING PAPER ? BECAUSE IT 'S DANGEROUS , MINDY . IT 'S A CHOKING HAZARD , IT 'S MADE OF LEAD AND PROLONGED EXPOSURE COULD CAUSE VIOLET INCONTINENCE IT COULD STAIN YOUR HANDS , STUNT YOUR GROWTH AND CAUSE TESTICULAR DESICCATION . HOOF-AND-MOUTH , DRY MOUTH , TRENCH MOUTH , AND IF YOU HOLD IT UP TO THE LIGHT , YOU CAN SEE SANTA 'S PENIS . TED . WHAT ? WHAT 'S COMING ? RELAX . I 'M OKAY NOW . THE EFFECTS WORE OFF . UNFORTUNATELY , IT WAS SEVERAL HOURS AFTER I STOLE A BABY . YOU STOLE A BABY ? ONLY FOR A FEW SECONDS . TURNS OUT , JUST BECAUSE YOU WRITE YOUR NAME ON SOMETHING DOESN 'T MEAN YOU GET TO KEEP IT . YEAH , I THINK BABIES HAVE TO BE NOTARIZED . WAIT . WEREN 'T LEM AND PHIL SUPPOSED TO BE WATCHING YOU ? YEAH , THERE 'S A LOT OF THINGS THOSE GUYS DON 'T DO WELL ... WATCH ME , NOT DOSE ME , STOP ME BEFORE I WRITE MY NAME ON A BABY . I 'M SO PISSED AT THEM . I WANT PAYBACK . OH , I 'M LINDA . I WANT PAYBACK . THAT 'S MY PAYBACK . I GOT THE WRAPPING PAPER BACK FROM HALF THE PEOPLE I SOLD IT TO . THE OTHER HALF WERE WILLING TO RISK THEIR LIVES TO SEE SANTA 'S JUNK . THAT 'S ROSE . CONGRATULATIONS , LOSER . WHAT ? WHAT DO YOU MEAN , YOU 'RE WAY AHEAD ? IT TURNS OUT VERONICA WASNapo ; T JUST SELLING WRAPPING PAPER . SHE WAS SELLING IT AT A WHOLE NEW LEVEL . THEY 'RE CALLED DERIVATIVES , AND YOU CAN 'T LOSE . MULTIPLE BUYERS OWE A BALANCE OF PAYMENTS ON THEIR GIFT WRAP , AND SO YOU BUY SHARES OF POOLED DEBT , GENERATING LONG-TERM DIVIDENDS WITH MINIMAL RISK . THAT 'S HOW I BOUGHT MY HOUSE . I 'M IN . DAMN , SHE 'S GOOD . VERONICA HAS BEEN BUSY ALL AFTERNOON . SHE WASN 'T JUST GONNA HAND ME MY ASS , SHE WAS GONNA HAND IT TO ME GIFT WRAPPED . ANALYSTS PROJECT THAT WRAPPING PAPER SALES ARE GOING TO IMPROVE , SO IF YOU BUY FUTURES NOW WITH THE OPTION TO SELL LATER , YOU CAN ANTICIPATE A ROBUST RETURN . VERONICA , WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? I 'M SORRY , TED . I 'VE PUT ROSE SO FAR AHEAD , THERE 'S NO WAY ANYONE CAN CATCH HER . ALTHOUGH , THERE 'S A 3 % CHANCE SHE COULD END UP IN JAIL . FINE . YOU WIN . I LIKE WHEN THAT HAPPENS , AND IT HAPPENS A LOT . ROSE WAS GONNA BE UPSET CYNTHIA DIDN 'T WIN . I WASN 'T THRILLED , EITHER , BECAUSE IT MEANT I HAD TO HAVE A LOVELY DINNER WITH THE GENERAL TO CONVINCE HIM TO PAY MORE FOR THE SOLAR OVENS . YOU KNOW HAT YOU HAVE ? A BODY LIKE A YOUNG MARK SPITZ . WELL , THANK YOU , GENERAL . I CAN 'T HEAR THAT ENOUGH . ALTHOUGH , FIVE TIMES IS GETTING PRETTY CLOSE . SO ... LET 'S TALK BUSINESS . I THINK WE CAN GO AN ADDITIONAL 10 CENTS PER UNIT . REALLY ? THAT ... THAT 'S TERRIFIC . YOU 'RE A HANDSOME MAN , TED . I HOPE THAT 'S NOT INAPPROPRIATE FOR ME TO SAY . IT 'S JUST A FACT . EVERYBODY 'S SO DAMN TOUCHY NOWADAYS , I - I NEVER KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE . TIME WAS , ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS KILL PEOPLE . NOW WE HAVE TO LEAVE THEM WITH PARTING GIFTS . PARTING GIFTS . HUH . ARE YOU PROPOSITIONING ME ? WHAT ? NO . IT 'S JUST ... THESE SOLAR OVENS , THEY 'RE NOT MEANT AS HANDOUTS . THEY 'RE MEANT AS GIFTS , RIGHT ? AND IF YOU WANT A GIFT TO BE APPRECIATED , IT SHOULD BE PRESENTED AS A GIFT . THAT 'S INTERESTING . OF COURSE , COMING FROM THAT MOUTH , EVERYTHING 'S INTERESTING . I AM A COMPETITIVE GUY . I MAKE NO APOLOGIES FOR THAT IF I SEE A WAY TO WIN , I 'M GONNA TAKE IT . AND SO I SOLD $ 5 MILLION OF WRAPPING PAPER TO THE MILITARY , AND I DID IT IN CYNTHIA 'S NAME . SHE WON THE TRIP TO DISNEYLAND , ROSE COULD KEEP GOING TO SCHOOL , AND I BEAT VERONICA . NO , YOU DIDN 'T . YOU STILL HAD TO GO TO DINNER WITH THE GENERAL . I SOLD MORE WRAPPING PAPER THAN YOU . THAT 'S NOT WHAT WE WERE COMPETING OVER . IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE COMPETING OVER . YOU 'RE SO COMPETITIVE , IT 'S SICK . NOT AS SICK AS YOU . THAT 'S RIGHT . I WIN ... AGAIN . HEY , DO YOU THINK THAT PATCH COULD 'VE HAD ANY OTHER SIDE EFFECTS ? BECAUSE I ... I 'VE BEEN REALLY ITCHY LATELY . WELL , ITCHINESS IS A SIDE EFFECT OF MANY DRUGS . SURE BEATS CRAZY , THOUGH , DOESN 'T IT ? I - I GUESS . IT 'S JUST , MY BACK IS SO SCRATCHY . MAYBE I SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR OR A LAWYER OR SOMETHING . AS SCIENTISTS WITH VERY LITTLE MONEY , WE SUGGEST YOU DON 'T SEE A LAWYER . WE COULD TAKE A LOOK . WOULD YOU ? FEATHERS ? SHE 'S GROWING FEATHERS . OH , MY GOD . WHAT DO WE DO ? CALM DOWN . JUST STAY CALM . WHAT ? DID HE JUST SAY " FEATHERS " ? YOU 'LL BE FINE . CHICKEN LADY ! CHICKEN LADY ! NO , I CAN 'T BE A CHICKEN LADY . I HAVE SO MUCH I WANT TO DO IN MY LIFE . I WANT TO GET MARRIED AND HAVE CHILDREN AND GLUE FEATHERS TO MY BACK TO MESS WITH IDIOT SCIENTISTS WHO ARE CARELESS WITH EXPERIMENTAL DRUGS . YOU CAN STILL DO ALL THOSE THINGS . OH , WAIT . WELL , NOW WE 'RE EVEN . AND NEXT TIME YOU DOSE ME , YOU BETTER FINISH THE JOB . HI , VERONICA . HI , CRAZY PANTS . LISTEN , ABOUT WHAT I SAID THE OTHER DAY ... YOU CALLED ME POWERFUL AND COMPLIMENTED MY CALVES . THAT 'S ALL I REMEMBER . OH , GOOD . SO YOU 'RE NOT MAD ? YOU 'RE OBSESSED WITH ME , LINDA . I LIKE THAT ABOUT YOU . NO , I 'M NOT . EVERYONE IN THIS PLACE IS NUTS .

 ( Shrieking ) ( Plaintive cries ) Hey ... You still in that cave ? I just feel so bad that I led her in there . You can 't blame yourself . It 's because of me that the witch got out . Look , you were just a kid . And I ran . You 're not running now , are you ? Your light must brighten a place that is dark . ( Tutor ) What is it , another memory ? It 's where you 'll find a message about your future and your past . I just need to find my mother 's message . Where ? Here in Finaqua . Concentrate , DG . You must let the light flow through you . ( Splashing echoes ) Flat rocks fly . ( DG ) Round rocks die . ( Glitch ) How 's she gonna find anything now ? The palace and the lake are gone . Azkadellia 's torched the place ... ( Cain ) Shh ! Quiet , Glitch . We need to find the perfect stone . Come on . ( Girls giggling ) ( Running footsteps ) It 's perfect ! Let 's save it . We 'll hide it for the perfect day . ♪ Two little princesses dancing in a row ♪ Spinning fast and freely on their little toes ♪ Where the light will take them no one ever knows ♪ Two little princesses dancing in a row ♪ I hope this is the perfect day . DG , if you 're seeing this message , then you 've overcome much on your journey to find the emerald . The emerald of the eclipse contains the power to bring either light or darkness to the O.Z. As you now know , the evil witch of the dark lives inside your sister . That is why she knows not of my plan and why I could only entrust the emerald 's power to you , my angel . Make haste now , south to the realm of the unwanted . There you must find a man named Ahamo . He will help you in the final leg of your journey to save the O.Z. To the gray gale , to the emerald . Wait ! Who 's Ahamo ? Ahamo is your father . I 'm so sorry , Sorceress . Wait for me here . I go into Finaqua alone . You 've found the past , little sister . What else have you found ? You 've brought Finaqua back . ( Young DG ) ' s perfect ! ( Young Azkadellia ) We 'll hide it , for the perfect day . ( Young Azkadellia ) Flat rocks fly . ( Young DG ) Round rocks die . ( Breathes deeply ) DG , if you 're seeing this message , then you 've overcome much on your journey to find the emerald . The emerald of the eclipse contains the power to bring either light or darkness to the O.Z. As you now know , the evil witch of the dark lives inside your sister . Make haste now , south to the realm of the unwanted . There you must find a man named Ahamo . He will help you in the final leg of your journey to save the O.Z. To the gray gale , to the emerald . How very clever , Mother . Hey , pooch . You OK over there ? You 've just been antsy as a guild fighter since we left Finaqua . I 'm ... just nervous about being a man on the run , I suppose . Yeah , I hear you . The sky 's clear . Yeah . But I get this funny feeling that we 're being followed . What do you think ? ( Chuckles ) Another mobat ? Didn 't you say it was probably just a random scout who stumbled across us ? Didn 't you say we should pretend it never happened ? You were sweating then , too . Let go of me ! Let go ... I 'd shoot you in the heart if I thought you had one . Cain ... What are those ? Breadcrumbs for Azkadellia . She had an inside man all along , didn 't she ? A spy . Tutor ? Your trail ends here . ( Tutor ) You don 't understand . I stopped dropping those a while back . Afraid you 'd get caught ? But you were family . I still am , DG . I care more about you than anybody else in the whole wide world . Then why would you do that ? For the last ... 15 annuals , I 've been locked up in a dark hole . Azkadellia came to me . She offered me my freedom if I 'd track you . If I had said no , she ... she would have killed me on the spot . So I figured ... at least I could keep her off your back while I help you rediscover your magic . But if that were the truth , why did you drop those disks ? Why didn 't you let us get away clean ? You know as well as I do that would have never worked . She would have been on us quick as death . Now , look , you guys , whether you like it or not ... those things bought us valuable time . Why didn 't you tell me sooner ? I swear , DG , I was just about to . I think it 's time to put this dog down . No . We 're all looking for second chances . Tutor , too . Thank you , DG . It doesn 't mean that I trust you , but we 're almost at the realm , and you 're the only one who knows what Ahamo looks like . Well , we can 't just let him walk . Maybe we could keep him on a short leash . That 's a good idea . If you really mean what you say , you won 't mind traveling with us as Toto . One wrong move , and I 'll take you on a walk you don 't come back from . You hear me ? Yeah . Now that we know that Azkadellia had a spy , she 's a lot closer than we thought . We 've got to pick it up a notch . Come on , let 's go . Come on . Ahamo ... Can 't a man just abandon his family and stay gone ? Even the most hated outcast still yearns for redemption in his heart . My mother and father planned all this from the beginning , didn 't they ? They know all about us , don 't they ? ( Witch 's voice ) They knew , and they left you for dead . I , on the other hand , will never leave you . Think ! Ahamo is a man weak of heart , blinded by emotion , nostalgic , sentimental . He was so happy here . That 's it . That 's it . There must be a trace we can follow . DG 's not the only one who can remember , is she ? Remember . Focus . ( Young Azkadellia ) DG ? ( Gasps ) ( Whispering ) ( Giggling ) ( Moans softly ) Leave them here . He 'll find them when he comes back with Mother . ( Young DG ) Do you think Father will know they 're from us ? Well , he told us to make him something he could keep forever , and he taught us how to sculpt clay . What if they 're touched with our magic ? Good idea . Now he 'll definitely know . Come on . Daddy . You loved that sappy little token of your daughters ' love , didn 't you ? I bet you still have it with you , glowing bright as a beacon . Go find the glow . ( Shrieking ) Find Ahamo . ( Barking ) What ? Trust me , the realm of the unwanted is here . Somewhere . ( Barking ) I think he 's found something . Come on . ( Barking ) I 'm fine . Where 'd he go ? ( Barking ) ( Glitch ) Over there ! ( Growling ) ( Glitch ) Come on . ( Toto barks ) Yeah . ( Glitch ) Well , that 's something you don 't see every day . ( Distant explosions and shouting ) ( Cain ) Careful , DG , careful . Easy . ( Fireworks explode ) Yeah , come on , let 's go . ( Carnival barkers shout ) Come on ... Come on , let 's go . Let 's go . Come on , come on . ( Cain ) Glitch ! Come on ! ( Whistling ) ( Drumming ) ( Bell chimes ) ( Man ) Come on ! ( Cheering ) ( Glitch ) Cain , uh , help a zipperhead out with a memory or two ? In this realm , who exactly are the unwanted ? Criminals , outlaws , and a few living experiments gone wrong . Oh , and my father 's here ? How odd . Hey , look . What 's he doing now ? I don 't know . Anybody got any money ? Can 't say they didn 't welcome us with open arms . Questions are answers unspoken . Isn 't it a little cramped in there ? Reference to uncomfortable tight spaces . Answer , yes . Isn 't that good ? OK . We gotta go find Ahamo . Answer , Ahamo is a hard man to find . You know him ? More money . Answer , know personally ? No . OK , great . Thank you for nothing . Goodbye . We were told that Ahamo was here in the realm . Reply , know of someone who might know this Ahamo . Answer , the Seeker . Where can we find the Seeker ? ( Laughs ) And you thought I had trouble with directions . The Seeker doesn 't talk to just anybody . Doesn 't like strangers . He 'll like us . Where is he ? I might be able to arrange a meeting . Really ? What 's the catch ? 20 platinums . 20 platinums ? Done . Where is this meeting place ? Local tavern at the edge of the realm . Meet there at the rising of the first moon after midnight . We 'll be there . ( Sniffs ) ( Clucks ) ( Shrieks ) Airofday . Seeker . They are looking for Ahamo . They asked for him by name ? Yes . I 've been seeking Ahamo many years . He holds valuable secrets . You can ask them all the questions you want before we turn them in . I am offering you my usual split for your help . Are you in ? I am . But we do it my way , just the two of us . Oh , Daddy ... Hm . I don 't like the looks of this place . Why don 't you guys wait outside ? I 'll cut the deal myself . No , I think we should stick together . I feel very safe with you guys . Really ? I don 't . You , sit and stay . There 's nothing to be afraid of . Where can we find the Seeker ? I 'm here . We were told that you knew where to find Ahamo . Show me your palm . What for ? Do you want my help or not ? It 's OK . The other one . Now ! We had a deal ! ( Screams ) Put me down ! ( Screaming ) ( Man ) I can 't see ! Get it off me ! ( Cain ) DG ! ( Cain ) DG ! ( Hammering ) Ow ! Ow ! Yeah , that 's right , abuse the guy with the zipperhead . It amazes me that you once influenced the queen . I know . Me too . Bet she wouldn 't be very proud of me right now , though , being empty-headed enough to let her daughter walk right into a trap . Yeah , you and me both . Look ! Look ! ( Raw ) Toto ! Hey , Toto , come on , show these Longcoats what you 're really made of . He just did . I believe you owe me something . A slow death or a quick one ? Didn 't I capture three of the most wanted men in the Zone ? What you did was stick your six greedy little hands into something far bigger than a bounty . Get rid of her . What ? No . No , Zero , don 't do this . Give me my money . Zero ! Word from the Sorceress . We should return to the tower . At least I 'll have a souvenir to remember you by . Why don 't you unshackle me ? I 'll teach you how to use it . ( Laughs ) You surprise me , Cain . Not a lot of men make it out of the iron suit with their sense of humor intact . Let 's see how funny you are when you 're ... hanging from the gallows in Central City Square . Let 's go ! ( Waves breaking ) ( Door opens ) ( Door closes ) Going somewhere ? What have you done with my friends ? Well , last I saw of them , they were putting up a good fight . Oh , so you only got a quarter of the bounty . I didn 't take you for the money . Oh ... Where I come from , freaks like you drive vans . DG , you don 't understand , so just calm yourself . Calm myself ? I 'm not a kidnapper . OK , so take me to my friends , Seeker . I only call myself Seeker so others in the realm will come to me when they want to find Ahamo . What ? It was your mother 's idea . What do you know about my mother ? Well , I know you look just like her . You got your passion and your grit from her ... your artistic ability from me . You 're my father ? Yes , DG . The one your mother calls Ahamo . I have been dreaming of this day , of seeing you again . OK . So you 've seen me , so ... give me whatever it is my mother sent me here for , and I 'll be leaving your , uh , teepee . Like it or not , DG , I 'm your father . No , no , I had a real father . He was a robot , but he was there for me . He was a good guy . That 's for kidnapping me ! And that 's for abandoning my mother ! And that 's for being a complete bastard ! Stop , DG ! Stop ! Everything you think you know , you don 't . Now , let me explain . Explain what ? Oh , you 're a pistol , I 'll give you that much . Just like your mother . Just as lovely , too . Don 't play that fake lovey-dovey card with me . I don 't buy it for one second . My feelings are as real as they get , DG . Go on , it 's from your mother . It 's from my mother ? Yeah . What is it ? It 'll lead you to the gray gale . And the emerald . DG ... I know this is a lot for you to handle right now . All I ask is that you open your heart . Trust me . Can you ? We have a long way to go and not much time . But I can 't go anywhere without my friends . DG , the eclipse is almost here , and you 're the O.Z. ' s only hope . Your friends understand how important this mission is . Ask yourself , what would they want you to do ? Come on , help me turn it over . Get this out of our way . I 'm sorry . ( Zero ) Now ! Would you and your troops like a drink of water ? ( Grunts ) ( Shouting ) Father ... Son . It just keeps spinning . Maybe you 're just trying too hard . Clear your mind . Remember how it felt when you were a little girl , how the light flowed through you . Just concentrate , Deej . ( Bell tinkles ) Hey , did you see that ? Hey ... ( Whooshing ) Hurry . Here , let me help you . Help me lift him off the cart . Right . Grab the other side . Fetch some bandages . On three ... This way . Move ! What 's that doing here ? ( Jeb ) I keep it to remind me . To remind everyone . What we 're fighting for . You know , I , uh ... I thought you were dead . They told Mother and I you were dead . If I knew you were still alive , I would have risked everything , crossed enemy lines to come get you . You know that , don 't you ? Yeah , I do . Excuse me , sir . Sergeant Mackinch is asking for you . " Sir ? " You , uh ... You running things around here ? It just worked out like that . I 'm proud of you , son . Hey ... You all right ? Sure . When I took off from the Nebraska State Fair , I got caught in a freak storm and somehow slipped over to this side . It was a rough crossing , but when the clouds cleared , I was hovering over this crystal blue lake , and the most beautiful woman I 'd ever seen . My mother ? From that day on , I was hers . We married , had two beautiful daughters . The perfect life . Until I messed it all up ... by letting the old witch escape . Your mother and I would have given anything to keep that memory hidden from you . No . I have to know . Well , when your sister ... killed you , when your mother gave you second life , we both knew something drastic had to be done , both for the O.Z. and for you . That 's why I took you to the other side , brought you to that tiny farmhouse . Why didn 't you stay ? Well , my job was here , to protect the secret of the emerald and prepare for your return . So all that time , you and my mother could never be together ? ( Bell tinkles ) There ! Azkadellia shield his mind . Raw cannot see . I 'll make this easier for you if you tell us everything you know about the machine . Bring it in . What do you got there ? ( Zero chuckles ) ( Metallic rattling ) ( Squeaking ) ( Gears ratchet ) ( Blades scrape ) What ... what are you ... What is that ? What , uh ... What , um ... Uh , what ... Are you , um ... OK ... OK , um ... ( Jeb ) Hold his fingers . No ... No , no ! No , wait , wait ! Wait , wait , wait ! No , not the fingers , not the ... ( Clicking , thudding ) Ah ! Ah ! Not the fingers ! I 'll tell you anything you want ! Shut up ! Oh , it 's too late . I 'll talk , OK ? ! ( Jeb ) Too late ! Son ... Let him talk . Talk . The machine forms an intense beam of light . Why ? It focuses the power of the emerald at the double eclipse . Locks the two suns behind the moon . It 'll bring darkness to the O.Z. forever . Damn thing 's the anti-sunseeder . Sunseeder ? Yeah , it 's a little doohickey I designed to slow the suns and extend the growing season . How do we shut it down ? Ask him . Well , it sounds like what she 's using it for is an entirely different barrel of monkeybats . I don 't know how her machine works . Part of you does ... Ambrose . ( Jeb ) Ambrose ? ( Cain ) Jeb ? Our spies found out " Ambrose " is the code word for the brain that runs the machine . My marbles are in the tower ? ( Cain ) Where are they ? Brain room . Brain room , sub-level three . Look , I ... I 've told you everything that you need to know . Can you just ... put that thing away ? Just , put the thing away , OK ? Can you just ... ( Clanks ) Glad to . ( Spoons clatter on table ) Jeb , what are you doing ? Job 's not done yet . Now we can finally finish this . Not like this . Put it away . This is the guy that killed Mother . He destroyed your life and mine . You want to let him live ? He deserves to die . I won 't deny that . ( Jeb ) Yeah ! Then what ? Killing him won 't bring back your mother . And it won 't honor her memory either . ( Clockwork gadget whirring ) ( Whirring stops ) ( Clockwork whirring ) ( Whirring ) ( Bell tinkling ) ( Bell buzzes and chimes ) I think that means we 're here . But I don 't see anything . Your mother told me about this place , but I never dreamed it would be so beautiful . Who 's buried here ? The ones whose blood runs through your veins , a royal succession that leads to you . And the oldest rests here . She was your greatest great-grandmother . The original slipper . First to make it through to the O.Z. from the other side . Dorothy Gale . You were named in her honor . The emerald is guarded by the gray gale . This you must do alone . ( Meows ) I 've been waiting for you . You 're Dorothy ? The emerald of the eclipse is in your hands now . Come on . ( Woman screams ) ( Cain ) Adora ! Adora ! ( Screams ) Adora ! No ! It won 't be long until the eclipse . We have to hurry . DG , you are everything I had hoped you 'd be . I am so proud of you . ( Horses whinny ) " I 'm so proud of you , my little girl . " You 're everything I hoped you 'd be . " Daddy ... you old romantic . ( Cries out ) No ! Daddy ... I 've missed you so much . What did you do to him ? He 's quite comfortable . You have something for me . Come on . Don 't you want to share your shiny new trinket with your big sister ? No ... You 're not my sister . It doesn 't look like much , does it ? But it has so much power . Oh ! Green 's not your color . ( Coughing ) I thought you were dead , little sister . Buried in the ground all these years . You 're not ... No . It 's where you belonged . You look good in marble . Green marble . ( Gasps ) ( Yells ) Help ! Help ! ( Thumping ) ( Screaming ) Help ! ( Man ) Break camp . We leave in an hour . ( Grunt ) What did you do ? ( Cain ) If we stop Azkadellia , we 'll be back for him in a few days . If not , he 'll be there a long time . I hope that 's justice enough for you . It 's not my first choice , but Mother would approve . If you don 't have heart ... you have nothing . Oh , who am I kidding ? This is all my fault . If I hadn 't thought of my machine in the first place , she never would have been able to twist it . Yeah . ( Sniffs ) ( Barks ) ( Crying ) I 'm scared . I don 't know what to do . ( Barking ) History is about to be repeated . And this time , I 'll get it right . ( Barks ) ( Sniffs ) Hey ... Hey . Are you sure you trying to find DG is the right thing ? She 's alive , I know she is . Someone in the realm has to know how to find this Seeker . DG is the key to bringing the witch down . Well , gods willing , I 'll see you at the tower then . Thank you . OK , let 's move it , men . We don 't have much time . Aw . Don 't you look pretty ? Good thing , 'cause I brought you a date . Oh ! Is it really you ? I have dreamed of this day . Oh , I love you . Enough . Do you know how long I have waited to see that look on your face ? No phony smile ... no brave front . Just pure and utter shock . It may be the most honest gift you 've ever given me , Mother . I am not your mother . Our daughter is really gone ? Both of your daughters are gone . DG is dead ? Your little girl 's quest has ended , as your royal line ends today . In darkness . Permanent ... darkness . ( Barks ) Toto ! ( Barking ) I can take you to DG . I know where she is . She 's in trouble . How do we know you 're not lying to us again ? Speak truth . All right , where is she ? She 's a long ways away , and we 'd better hurry . Hurry ? How ? ( Horses whinnying ) ( Ahamo ) Clear your mind . Remember how it felt when you were a little girl . How the light flowed through you . ( Tutor ) Concentrate , DG . Show me how she spins without touching it . ( Grinding ) Toto ? You OK ? DG ... ( Barks ) Do you have the emerald ? Where is it ? She 's got it , Cain . OK , come on . Let 's go . We don 't have much time . Security 's as high as I 've ever seen it . Yeah . Of course . Why would it be easy ? Well , if you guys can blow the generators that power those turbines , we can sneak in the same way we escaped . ( Jeb ) I 'll send my best men down to lay charges . Kind of boggles the noggin to think we 're going in there with all guns blazing . Well , let 's hope we 're the quiet part of this plan . We 're almost ready . Have you guys seen Raw ? I , uh , think he 's lost his nerve . Hey , Raw . I wanted to show you something . That 's bad , right ? I mean ... . you lost the emerald , so ... What does that mean ? It means ... that I don 't need it anymore . All that I need is right here . Raw ... You are no coward . You have taught me ... that courage is not about being fearless , It 's about standing up in spite of your fear . And you stood up ... to the pa-pays , you threw yourself off a cliff ... you escaped from prison . Raw do that for DG . No . You did that for you . Courage has been in you all along . You know , when I had a brain , I was twice as scared as I am now with only half a brain , which means that if I had no brain at all , I would be four times braver than I was when I was brainy . Glitch . You 're the smartest guy I know . Uh-uh . No , you 're just saying that to make me feel good . You helped me remember my past , and that 's probably the most important weapon I have now . Thank you . I know what you 're doing , kid . I 've led men through battle myself . And , um , how am I doing ? Well , there 's less hugging when I do it . But not so bad . We better get going ... Look ... You may not be able to save your sister . So if our plan doesn 't work , you will try to get out of there . Right ? This is the one time that I 'm not going to be there to help . You 've already helped me , Mr. Cain . I 'm serious . Don 't go up there and lose your head , and ... forget about what 's really important . What 's really important ... is family . I can 't remember who taught me that . Good luck , Mr. Cain . I want no interruptions once it begins . After 500 years , I want this moment to be ... perfect . Forward light pulse is at 100 percent . All we need now is power . ( Sighs ) ( Man ) Explosion ! The west wall , quickly ! ( Man ) Come on , men ! Move , move , move ! The resistance is giving me a fireworks display . Hm ! You three with me . Yes , sir ! ( Gasps ) Let it begin . ( Revving up ) ( Klaxon ) What is it ? Intruders . We 're doubling the guard . ( Man ) This way ! Let 's go . Raw , which way ? Up one floor . All right , let 's do it . Good luck . ( Toto barks ) I thought you hightailed it . Go . I 'll watch out . Go . Hey , look ! I 'd recognize me anywhere . Glitch ... Hmm ? It 's time to get reacquainted with yourself . ( Chuckles ) Connect him to it . All right , Glitch , I need you to remember something for me . Glitch , can you hear me ? My name isn 't Glitch . It 's Ambrose . OK . Ambrose . I need you to remember how you designed the sunseeder , and how to shut it down . Do you see the keyboard numbers that control the light pulsing ? Yeah . About a million of them . Which ones do I turn off ? Proper shut-down sequencing to reverse light pulsing is imperative ... OK . Which numbers ? 1066 . ( Buzzer drones ) 1418 . 1666 . What 's causing the problem ? Power surging in the brain cortex . Some kind of synapse interference . Get Kalm . You two , come with me . Azkadellia ! There 's still time to stop this ! Look up ! The power of the emerald is about to lock the eclipse in the sky and bring permanent darkness to the O.Z. A fierce new world is awakening . No ! Listen to me , my sister ! This is not what you want ! Remember who you are ! ( Witch 's voice ) Your sister is dead . No . ( Screams ) ( Whines ) Ah ! Please , please ... Ah ! Ah , good . Oh . I think it 's working . 1789 . Why are we losing power ? ( Laughs ) And the last number ... Yeah . To reverse light pulsing ... Yeah ? Ah ! ( Clang ) ( Groans ) One more , and it will be your last . Aah ! No ! Don 't fire your weapon in here ! Kalm , tell me what they did and how to fix it . Now ! Ah ! Turn on ... 1789 . 1666 ... 14 ... 18 . 2025 ... Shut him up ! One more number , Kalm . I can 't find it ! I need the final number for full power ! ( Screams ) 1485 . ( Whirring ) ( Sighs ) Ah ... Ah , good . ( Azkadellia ) Finally ... permanent darkness . It 's over . I won . ♪ Two little princesses dancing in a row ♪ Spinning fast and freely on their little toes ♪ Where the light will take you no one ever knows ♪ Two little princesses dancing in a row ♪ Spinning fast and freely on their little toes ♪ Where the light will take them no one ever knows ♪ Two little princesses dancing in a row ♪ Do you remember that time at the cave when you remembered what all those symbols meant ?

( Shrieking ) She melted . ( Laughing ) ( Door opens ) My Azkadellia ? Mother ... Oh , is it really you ? The witch is gone . It 's over . DG ! Oh ! I thought I 'd never see you again . Oh ! Welcome home . Thank you . ( Laughs ) That 's the O.Z. I remember . I 'm so glad to be home .

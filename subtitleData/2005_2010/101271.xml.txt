 [ Jordan ] : we 're not a threat . We 're salvation . The world will have to deal with us . Previously on the 4400 ... I 'm blacking out . If you 're losing chunks of time , You should talk to your dad about it . What 's he going to do ? Turn me over to ntac medical ? Let me see if i 've got this straight . You two met , fell in love , And spent eight years together In some kind of alternative reality ? Liv , you were pretty far gone last night . When i o.D. , It 's not going to be any big loss , right ? Maybe i can save you . Whatever it is , There 's a way out of it . That 's easy to say . You don 't know what " it " is . You told me everything that happened that night , right ? Yeah . If you need some time To clear your head and get away from everything So you can figure stuff out , I can make that happen . [ Kyle ] : dad , i had to leave . I 'm sorry . Look , i 'm not interested in excuses . I don 't care how you do it , who you have to lean on , You just get him out of lock-Up and over to l.A.X. I want him on the next plane out . Skouris , where 's baldwin ? He 's not in yet . Why ? What 's going on ? L.A.P.D. Is holding Some piece of street garbage Who wants to see daylight again . Says he can make the dealer Who sold the collier murder weapon . Who 's handling the l.A. Interview ? Nobody . I 'm having him shipped up here For questioning . This one feels good . My partner 's going to like hearing that . You can fill me in when i get to the office . Look , i know we 're not ready To pop any champagne yet , But this witness has intel we kept out of the media , Specific details about the collier murder weapon . Sounds like we finally caught a break . Look , diana , i really have to go . Are you okay ? You sound a little distracted . It 's personal business . Not your worry . Well , any idea what time you 'll be in ? I can 't really say just yet . Look , i 'll get in touch with you as soon as i can , okay ? Okay , no problem . Bye . How long has this Been going on ? Calm down . No . I asked you a question . How long ? Look , kyle told me , like , a month ago . Look , you remember that night ? Wha- - What night ? The night That he almost got arrested for smashing that store window . You mean when he got drunk ? He never said he was drunk . You said he was drunk . Kyle said he blacked out . It happened a bunch of times After that . One minute , he 'd be one place , The next thing he knew , he was someplace else . He never mentioned it to me . He never said anything . Well , he tried once , but you wouldn 't listen . Look , you could have come to me , danny , Told me what was going on . He 's your cousin , your friend . Which is why i promised him not to . The last thing kyle wanted Was to be thrown back into quarantine . Danny , kyle never came home last night . If you know where he is , Please , tell me . He went to stay with shawn over at the 4400 center . Great . Uncle tommy ... There 's something else you ought to know . Kyle thinks he did something During one of his blackouts . He wouldn 't tell us what it was , But he really seemed freaked out about it . E committee 's latest recommendation . 37-Year-Old pipe fitter from detroit . He was diagnosed with hodgkin 's disease Four months ago . When do we fly him in ? Two days from now . Shawn . Where is he ? Who ? Kyle ? He 's not here . Don 't play games with me , shawn . Can you excuse us , lucy ? Thank you . Danny said kyle came here . Yeah , well , danny needs to check his text messages , Because kyle never showed . You 're not listening to me , shawn . I want my son . You 're not hearing me . He 's not here . Where do you think i have him stashed , In the basement ? I wouldn 't put it past you . Oh , my g- - Uncle tommy ! Just because kyle is having a rough time Does not make it my fault ! Been known to happen , shawn . He 's not here ! [ Gentler ] : he 's not here . Kyle ? Thomas . I picked this up In a village outside barcelona , And they said it was very special . What 's wrong ? Kyle never told me any of this . At least i 'm not the only one out of the loop . I thought the doctors said he was fine When he left quarantine . They did ... But he spent three years With a separate consciousness living inside of him . I don 't think the doctors knew what to do with that . Have you called the police ? I can 't get them involved , Not until i know what kyle did . What about linda ? Well , she says she hasn 't heard from him . Promises to call if she does . I 'm sorry about all of this . I 'm just glad i 'm back . Where are you going ? Well , i 'm not going to find him sitting here . I 'll come with you . No . Look ... I 'd rather you stay here by the phone . This way , if he calls ... You 'll be here . Okay . I 'll stay in touch . [ Shawn ] : and this guy Is some big-Deal media consultant ? [ Matthew ] : oh , he 's more than that . Keith petrick has prepped prime ministers , Members of parliament . I 'd say an interview with sky news Merits a few hours homework . So he 's going to tell me what ? Just new and different ways To say " we 're not a cult ? " No , he 's going to teach you To stay on message . The british press loves to play " gotcha . " Keith . Matthew ross . Thank you for coming . This is shawn farrell . Hi . Hi . Nice to meet you . Shawn . Just one minute . Sorry . Uncle tommy came to see me . Yeah . That 's what i figured . He came here , too . What 'd you tell him ? Well , the truth . Kyle ditched us . He never showed . Listen , you know , he might still show up . You know ? Yeah . I 'd give you the big tour , but ... Yeah . No . Things are crazy . I get it . Wait , just wait , just wait . Liv . Liv . Hey . This is danny , my brother . Hi . Hey . This is liv . She 's one of our first keys . Actually , i 'm second key now . Really ? I 'm impressed . Star pupil . Hey , do you think You could give him a tour ? You know , shawn , you don 't have to- - I want you to see the place . Just hold on . Is that cool ? Sure . Yeah . It 's cool . You two kids have fun . I 've got to- - I have to go back to work , so ... . That 's my brother , off to heal the world . Somebody has to . You ready ? Yeah . I 'm all yours . Come on . I know who sold the rifle that killed collier . That 's a start . Does we have a name ? Victor rios . R-I-O-S . He lives at 43207 sumac drive . S-U-M-A-C- - I 've got it . Thank you . I 'm at victor 's place last month . He gets all cranked up And starts waving this cannon around Like he 's the second coming of tony montana . He wants to swap it for some of my product . I told him i wasn 't interested . Can you describe the weapon , mr . Kovec ? I watched him put that sucker together . .50 caliber . Never saw bullets so big . And it had this humongous scope on it , Like a huge neon sign saying " can 't miss . " What makes you so sure This was the weapon that killed collier ? Because ... Next time i saw rios , He was bragging on how much he scored For that piece . This was , like ... Two days before collier got taken out . I figure that 's not a coincidence . What do you think ? I ask you to give him a quick tour , And two hours later ... She 's a good guide . Really sells this place . Danny was expecting shaved heads and robes . Yeah . I didn 't see a single tambourine . Are you disappointed ? Ah , you don 't hear me complaining . So , hey , listen , big boss man , You let your workers off the farm at night ? So i invited liv to a party , But she 's too shy To ask if it 's okay . Think of her Like a missionary- - A lot of potential recruits Out there at the northmount campus . Could be cool . I haven 't left the center in a while . I don 't think it 's a good idea . I 'm sorry , man . You 're going to have to find yourself a different date . Who are you , her warden ? Danny . Listen , you guys can hang out here As much as you want , no problem . But a kegger , that 's another story . The wise and powerful shawn Has spoken . I hear and obey , your majesty . I 'm serious . Since when did shawn Have such a problem with keggers ? Since he developed a messiah complex . So what time 's this party ? All right . I woke up in the middle of the night And there was kyle , out here , Crouching in the hallway . With no idea how he got there . That 's right . And i sent him away . You were , uh ... you were scared . It 's understandable . Not as scared as he was . I told him he needed to get help , That he should talk to you About these blackouts . I wish he had . We 'd have worked it out . Well , he wanted to . Then what stopped him ? Look , mr . Baldwin , Your relationship with your son is none of my business- - Agreed , But if you have something to say , say it . I 'm sure kyle loves you ... But i don 't think he really trusts you . What ? He told you that ? Pretty much . Eggs , butter , walnuts , cocoa powder . Who said making brownies was difficult ? Don 't forget to preheat the oven At 350 degrees . Uh-Oh . Now things are getting really complicated . Relax . I 'm just kidding . Yeah ? Now ? No . That shouldn 't be a problem . I just need to get a sitter first . If there 's a problem , i 'll call you back . I 'm sorry , sweetie , i 've got to go to work . I 'll call mrs . Skalka , see if she can come- - No , wait . Don 't go . Well , i have to . We can make brownies another time . That man ... You don 't want to catch him . What man ? The man you 're chasing after . Someone 's going to get hurt . Who ? Is it someone i work with ? I don 't know . Just don 't go . Are you worried about me ? Don 't go . I think he get my car and head for the border ? Or ask to be assigned to another case . Hmm . Hand the risk off to another agent ? It 's not an option . Have you told tom ? No , not yet . He 's been off the case for a while . Might be better for his health if he stays that way . She said someone was going to get hurt , But she didn 't say who . I don 't know . Maia 's visions aren 't usually so vague . This time , She 's had a vision involving her mother . Maybe she doesn 't want to see it too clearly . You 're not making me feel any better . Okay . How about this ? Hmm ? Any better ? Sure . You recognize that man , Mrs. Rios ? He was a customer of your husband 's . Husband ? He got me my green card And more trouble than i need . Why don 't you ask victor ? If you can find him . Yeah , well , that 's the problem , mrs . Rios . Your husband has left the country . Now , we know he 's in puerto rico . You see ? You know more than me . He didn 't tell you he was leaving ? I haven 't seen him in two weeks . Look , i need to get back to work . A month ago , your husband Sold this man a weapon . Your husband is implicated In a murder , mrs . Rios . This is not a very good thing for you . Particularly if you value Your green card . Why don 't you just take Another look at the sketch ? [ Dishes clatter on counter ] I remember the beanie . Not a regular customer . He only stopped by once . He was the one who bought the big rifle . And the handgun . What handgun ? Uh , you know . What do you call it ? A 9 mm . Anything else ? He was young ... In his twenties . Very quiet . He only stayed a few minutes , then left in a taxi . How do you know that ? I called it for him . Oh , we 're going to need that number . We were in the middle of a bio-Lab practical , Kyle stood up , Said he 'd be right back , and that was it- - Bye-Bye . Didn 't see him again till the next day . About what time did he leave ? Had to be 7 : 00 , 8 : 00 , tops . He 's wrong , as usual . It was closer to 6 : 00 . Don 't you remember ? We broke up right after kyle ditched . Yeah , look . Anybody remember the date ? End of last month , wasn 't it ? It was the 25th . You sure ? Yeah . I remember when i got back to the dorm , It was all over the news . Jordan collier 's murder . [ Cellphone ringing ] Baldwin . You going to grace us with a visit tomorrow ? Yeah , i 'm hoping , But right now it 's looking doubtful . Doubtful doesn 't cut it . We 're closing in on this guy . Look , we 've got real leads , and i need you in here . What kind of leads ? You want to know ? You get your ass into work . Thomas , it could be anyone . Look closer . Tell me there isn 't a resemblance . This is insane . Why would kyle want to shoot jordan collier ? If it happened during one of the blackouts , He wouldn 't need a reason . Not if the future wanted their number one prophet dead . So you think they were controlling him again ? Yeah , directing his actions , Moving him around like a puppet . Anything 's possible . Well , in that case , he wasn 't responsible . The " body snatcher " defense ? Alana , i 'm not sure the jury 's going to buy it . What the hell do they want from kyle ? They took four years of his life . Isn 't that enough ? They warned us about this , remember ? They said you 'd be facing a crisis . What , and that makes it all right ? They warned me ? I don 't remember them telling me They 'd turn my son into a murderer . There must be a reason . Don 't defend them , alana . Just don 't ! They used me ... All of us- - Kyle , shawn . I 'm fed up . I love him too . I know . I know you do , alana . Just ... I 've got to find him before ntac does . I 've got to find him . [ Liv ] : stop it . [ Laughing ] : serious business . Your answers are going to determine How far you go in the center . If that security guard comes by , we 'll both get kicked out . Is that far enough ? Okay ... question number one- - Did you have fun tonight ? Aren 't you glad we didn 't listen to shawn ? That 's two questions . Shh . Oh ! You 're supposed to think about your answers , Not say them out loud . Right . Rules are rules . Okay . What are we , done ? Question number two ... Are you ready for the night to be over ? If your answer to question number two Is " no , " Remove your goggles and take your medicine . Percocet . Where 'd you get these ? At the party . Your buddy had them in the medicine cabinet . So you stole them ? [ Guard ] : what 's going on in here ? Thanks so much , mrs . Skalka . I couldn 't sleep . Was that because of me ? Well , i 'm home now , sweetie . No worries . You know this case that i 'm working on , Can you tell me anything else about what you saw ? Anything at all ? Because if you 're keeping something from me ... I told you everything . Don 't you believe me ? Of course i do . Are you going to work tomorrow ? Well , honey , it 's my job . Can i go to sleep now ? Sure . Here . Linda . Have you heard from kyle ? No . I would 've called you if i had . I was hoping you 'd heard something . Linda , you two talk all the time . Yeah , i don 't remember any law against it In the divorce settlement . Listen , linda , If you have any idea where he is- - What , you think i 'm holding something back ? You 're the one with all the secrets . Look , you 're his mother . It makes sense you 'd try to protect him . In any way i could . But i thought that 's why he was living with you , wasn 't it ? Protecting him was supposed to be Your specialty . You want to blame me ? Fine . Go ahead , but i 've got to find kyle now . What if he doesn 't want you to find him ? I think he may be in trouble . Serious trouble . Tom , what is it ? What did he do ? At least give me a hint . You don 't want to know . It 's like i said ... You 're the one with all the secrets . [ Ringing ] Hello ? Kyle , i just spoke to your father . You didn 't tell him where i was . You came to me Because you didn 't want to go back to ntac . That 's what you said . Mom , i can 't talk to you about this . I told you . Well , that 's not the whole story , is it ? Mom , please . Kyle , tell me what 's going on . Could you excuse me for a moment ? Sure . Thank you . Just don 't tell me " i told you so . " Okay , i won 't , but i did . Don 't go blaming danny for any of this . It was all me , okay ? The night just got away from me . I had some beers , and i ... You shouldn 't be having beers , liv . You shouldn 't be having anything . A month ago , you were an addict . We can quit the lecture . I 've already packed my bags . You know , you want to quit , i can 't stop you . But if you want to stay ... And you can promise me That nothing like this is ever going to happen again , Then please , enjoy life as a first key . I 'm a second key . Not anymore . Ahem . Mr. Farrell ? Are you going to be much longer ? No . Come in . So i 've got a bunch of new songs I 've written . Maybe i can play them for you sometime . Yeah . We 'll see . It 's not like I know him better than you , But we do talk . And he told you Where his secret hiding place was ? No , but you looked In all the obvious places , And kyle likes his privacy . Maybe you do know him better than i do . No ... I didn 't want to believe it , i kept ... I kept hoping i was wrong about this . Thomas , This is not kyle 's doing . You 've got to hold on to that . [ Jarvis ] : okay ... I want a couple of you guys to go down there ... Wait , don 't turn around . [ Man over p.A. ] : Express line direct to vancouver , Please board now on platform three . Chris benson , please report to lost and found . Chris benson , lost and found , please . Alana , take this , hide it in the house . What are you going to do ? Go back to work . All right , i want this area secured . Garrity , i want a warrant To have these lockers opened and searched , a.S.A.P. Well ... Look who came out of retirement . Good timing , baldwin . Your partner can bring you Up to speed . That is , assuming You intend to stick around . I 'm here . Mm-Hmm . Well , we do know That two days before the assassination , Our man arrived at this station With a bag full of firearms . Well , he could 've gone anywhere from here . Yes , so we 're canvassing all the metro routes , We 're talking to the baggage handlers , Ticket agents , bus drivers ... That sounds right . Meantime , we just had a shoeshine guy I.D. The sketch . He claims he helped our man make change to buy a locker . Does he recall which locker ? He thinks it 's in that group there . [ Scoffs ] : but all the people Who use these lockers in a month ... The odds are , like , 1 in , what , 10,000 We 'll turn up anything useful . Yeah , so why are we even bothering ? You never know . All we need is one print . Yeah . We can only hope . I guess . You okay ? Maia had another vision . Now , she says if we catch this guy , Someone 's going to get hurt . Did she say who ? Welcome back . [ Doorbell rings ] Is tom here ? Uh , no , he isn 't . You must be alana . I 'm linda . I know . That my interview ? I don 't want to see it . I know i sucked . I wouldn 't go so far as " sucked . " But you could do with more eye contact , Better enunciation . But they didn 't drag any unnecessary dirt out of you , And that 's something . I was all distracted . Liv was here right before , and we got into this thing- - Because you told that junkie not to go out with your brother . Ex-Junkie . I 'm just trying to protect her , that 's all . I 'm sure that was part of it . What do you think , i 'm jealous of danny ? You do realize That a relationship with this girl Is out of the question . Matthew , advise me all you want about the center ... But that 's where it stops . You don 't understand , shawn . You are the center . Everything about you , everything you do . You cannot afford to have an inappropriate relationship . Jordan collier was all about inappropriate relationships . I mean , every girl in this place was fair game to him . All the more reason not to repeat his mistakes . So what girl is worthy of the great shawn farrell ? I will let you know when you meet her . On to more important things ... I wish i had time to wipe that locker clean . Kyle 's prints could be all over it . We 've got to find him , get him out of town . Out of the country . You didn 't get anything else out of linda ? Something she wouldn 't tell me ? No , she 's as scared as we are . I felt guilty lying to her . The less people who know the truth , The better . Still , i know how hopeless she feels . Her son is missing . She needs answers , And all she has to go on Is a three-Line goodbye note . Did you tell her about the note ? No . She brought it up herself . I never mentioned it to her . Kyle ... Dad . No , kyle , wait ! Wait ! Goddammit , stop it ! Let go of me ! Enough ! Enough , kyle . Then i being up havon that roof , er . Watching collier through the scope , The way the trigger felt When i pulled it , And how his body twisted Before it hit the ground ... I mean , i remember all of it , But it just feels like somebody else 's memories . They are . You weren 't in control of your actions , kyle . You did not kill jordan collier . I haven 't had another blackout since . You think it 's over ? Let 's hope so . How long do you think i 'll be put away for ? Kyle , i am not going to let them Put you in prison for something you did not do . Do you hear me ? Yeah . I just only wish You would have told me about these blackouts When they first started . You tried . I didn 't listen . You know ... It 's not a new thing , dad . I- - I know i haven 't always been there for you , kyle , But i thought we had a pretty good relationship . We do . It 's just , you know , growing up With a dad who works for the fbi , ntac ... It can be pretty intense , you know ? You mean i can be pretty intense . You can be scary at times . If you don 't believe me , ask mom . I don 't have to . I believe you . I 'm sorry , dad . Me too . Hey , baby . Kyle . Hi . I packed a few things for you . Anything else you need , We 'll get in brussels . What time is the flight ? Noon . All right , we 'd better check in at the airport . We 'll be safer there . Okay , i emailed my friend , And they 'll meet us when we land . They promised To take good care of kyle . Say goodbye to mom for me , okay ? Sure . I promise to break the news to her gently . I 'll come and visit you as soon as i can , kyle . That 'd be good . Okay . I love you . I love you . All right . Thanks , dad . Yeah . Alana ... Keep a close eye on him , okay ? I will , thomas . I will . So far , we 've found two ounces of hash , Some bootleg dvds , And three dop kits that belong to people Who shower in the terminal bathrooms . I 'm hoping we find a picture of collier With a big fat " x " marked through it , All covered in usable prints . Yeah . Is everything okay at home ? Because if you need to take care of business , Now is a good time . I can hang with forensics In case something turns up . Thanks . I 'll , uh ... I 'll stick around here . Skouris . When did that happen ? No . We 'll be right there . That was jarvis . She just got a call from metro west . They arrested a suspect 40 minutes ago , Claim he 's our guy . [ Jarvis ] : roy keith marsden . 25 , unemployed , Made threats against collier After his uncle joined the 4400 center . Oh , and get this- - He owned a .50-Caliber jlhp-6 . Alana ? Forget about the flight . Bring kyle home . They just arrested a suspect in the collier killing . [ Music playing on radio ] You know , if you 're here To give me grief about liv , You can forget it . What happened was your screw-Up , Not mine . You know , you could 've pulled me aside , Told me she had this drug problem . I would 've backed off . So if you 're expecting me To apologize And kiss your robe , You 're wasting your time . I didn 't come here for that . Look , i just don 't want this to become a big thing . Okay ? When we were kids , We used to fight like crazy . Yeah . All the time . Yeah , and then the next day , we 'd blow it off . Everything would go back to normal . Yeah . Simple as that . Nothing wrong with simple . Are you , uh , planning on standing there , Or are you going to help me out here ? With the car ? I don 't wash cars anymore . I 've got people that do that for me . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . Yeah , well , i don 't , so ... Grab a sponge . Oh , see , now ... I should 've known i was going to get wet . Yeah , attaboy . Get your hands dirty . It 's been a while , huh ? Oh ! Give me that ! Come on . Hey , sweetie . Hi . Look , i know you 've already had dinner , But what do you say We take another crack at those brownies ? Okay . Great . So how was your day ? Pretty good . Good . Aren 't you going to ask me about mine ? We caught that man , The one that we were looking for , And guess what . Nobody was hurt . So there 's nothing to worry about . It 's all over . Not yet .

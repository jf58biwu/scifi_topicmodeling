 'How did it happen ? 'How did the world get swallowed up so quickly ? ' Bill ! 'It was because we had our eyes closed . 'Even when we could see . ' Billy ! 'And we let them get too close . ' Bill ! 'It had been 30 years since my mother was killed by a triffid . 'She was trying to understand them . 'I 've been doing the same ever since . 'For me , it 's always been personal . 'For the rest of the world , the triffids were simply a practical solution . 'They contained an oil that quickly replaced fossil fuels . 'Triffids became man 's best friend . 'But they didn 't see the consequences . 'And I couldn 't get them to listen . ' I 'm disconnecting this triffid . Confirmed . Triffid tether de-activated . Dr Masen , you 're clear to start your reaction test . GURGLING Still trying to get something else out of the triffs , Dr Bill ? Well , yes . I suppose I am . You really think they can hear ? More like they can feel the sound waves . The reaction time ... The triffids are getting faster with every new generation . They seem to be evolving on their own . Um , Lucy ... Yeah ? Taser . Oh , sorry . Thank you . 'Breeding triffids for their oil came at a price . 'The oil companies were forced to lock them away and keep the world in the dark . ' Paper check . Sure . Can I see your papers ? 'Some thought we shouldn 't interfere with Mother Nature . ' 'Yet were ignorant to the danger that waited inside the refinery walls . ' 'Waiting for the chance to be free . ' PURRING We have an orchard security breach . Received and understood . Tether the triffid . ALARM SOUNDS Do not enter the orchard without back-up . Negative . They 'll never last that long . I 'm going in now . All units to the orchard immediately . Security needs urgent assistance . Agh ! Get back ! Stay back , or she gets that again ! So what goes on in here , then , uh ? What are you hiding ? Put her glasses back on and then we can talk . Glasses ? Please , put them on . Please . I don 't think so . Put mine on her . GROWLING Please ! You do it . I know who you are ! Dr Bill Masen . I bet the triffids know exactly what you are . You should listen to them , Doctor , huh ? You might learn something , instead of stealing their oil , messing with their genes . What 's wrong ? You lost your tongue , huh ? You got an opinion , Doctor ? Agh ! Agh ! Agh ! Agh ! Arrrgh ! Agh . Agh . People need to know what 's going on in here ! Get him out of here ! Look at the sky ! Stay where you are , don 't move . Agh ! Look at the sun ! Look at it ! Agh . Open the door ! Let me go ! Get out of the way ! Bill . HE MOANS Oh , thank God . I thought I 'd lost you . Must have been a young plant . Venom sac 's not fully developed yet . You hold on in there , Dr Bill . We 'll be in London soon . RADIO : They say it 'll be the greatest light show ever . Northern lights seen as far south as Hawaii , a veritable rainbow of comets . But is it another result of the global cooling triffid scientists have been boasting about , or something else ? With me is astrophysicist Edward Vorless . Welcome , Professor . So , tell me , do we have the triffids to thank for the fireworks , too ? Oh , we can certainly thank the triffids , or at least their marvellous oil for saving us from global warming . But the fireworks , no . So , what is the cause ? The sun . Tonight we will see its true power . It will unleash a solar storm . An unbelievably vast explosion of gas and nuclear fire that will send billions of tons of irradiated plasma shooting towards the Earth . And is there any risk to us ? Any precautions we should take ? Only if you are a satellite . We humans will suffer no harm . We should sit back and enjoy the fireworks . Well , thank you , Professor . So tonight we 'll be covering this phenomenon from round the globe . My bosses are even putting me on camera . You know , you people should come clean how dangerous these plants are . Tell me , why do triffids always go for the eyes ? I don 't know . Well , you should find out . Cos I 'd say you have a 50-50 chance of losing your sight . Or of keeping it . 'Hello , I 'm Jo Playton , ' coming to you from the heart of London . And the sky really is quite spectacular . It 's like the aurora borealis , only a lot brighter ...

Jo , bring him in . .. happening millions of miles away . Later , I 'll be talking to people here and getting their reactions . But now , let 's go over to Jim Watts in Sydney . OK , Jim . The sun is so bright , it 's really hard to see the sky . Jo , get yourself down the Tube . Talk to some people who are ignoring this whole damn thing . Make it entertaining , will you , love ? All right , I 'm trying . I 'll be back for you , Dr Bill . How long will he be out for ? At least 24 hours . Shame he 'll miss the light show . Is everything OK ? Yeah . Looks like it 's about to start . 'I 've often dreamt about that night . 'About what it would have looked like . 'Some said it was glorious , 'as if the heavens ignited 'and God himself was conducting the show . ' It 's started and it 's unbelievable . We never expected anything like this .

I don 't understand . You 're telling me that triffids can move ? And do this to people ? Yes . Keep your eyes open and keep moving . The orchard 's been breached as well . What is this place ? It 's where the male triffids are confined . Or it should be . Stay close . What happened to him ? Triffids are carnivores . They eat people . Did you know him ? No . No . He 's the idiot who let them out . Oh , no . Not Lucy . She fought . She was blind , but she fought . I 'm sorry . Was she your , er ... ? She was my friend . You people knew . You knew that they were dangerous and yet it never got out . Triffid oil saved the world from global warming . You think it would have made any difference if you had known ? But if ... At least you have a generator . Until the Triffoil runs out . There 's a sofa . You should get some rest . What are you going to do ? I need to get my research before it 's too late . Bill , will you take me to my dad 's ? He lives near Windsor . It 's miles from the triffid farms . Yeah . 'I spent my whole life working with triffids , trying to make sense of them . 'And now my obsession seemed more important than ever . ' GROWLING What 's that sound ? Triffid recordings . They 're communicating . So what are they saying ? That 's what I 've been trying to work out . It 's the basis of my research . This device contains years of triffids ' communications . I 've proved there 's signs of evolving intelligence . So far I 've failed to work out what they 're saying . And now they 're free . Come on . Let 's get your dad . How many farms are there ? Across the world ? Tens of thousands . In England , 500 . Each one holds about 20,000 triffids . Ten million meat-eating plants . How do they reproduce ? Same as other plants . The males pollinate the females . That 's why it was essential that we controlled the males . And now they 're out . Dad ! Dad ? Dad , it 's me , Jo ! Dad ? Dad ? Dad ! Jo ! Dad ! Dad ! Jo , stop ! Argh ! Dad ! Stop ! GROWLING Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Stop ! Stop ! Dad ! Jo ! No ! Don 't ! Don 't . Do something ! There 's nothing we can do . He 's dead ! We have to get out of here . They 're everywhere , Jo ! No , he can 't be dead . You bastard ! He 's my dad ! Give it to me . GUNSHOTS SCREECHING Oh ! SHE SOBS Oh , I shouldn 't have left you . I shouldn 't have left you ... GROWLING INTENSIFIES Jo . Jo , we have to get out of here . Come on . If we stay here , they 'll kill us , too . Come on . They 're all around us . Jo , we have to go . Bill , stop the car . 'That 's when we knew that our day was over 'and the day of the triffids had begun . ' We need to warn people . Bill , go over there . This is an emergency broadcast from the BBC in London . Most of the people in the United Kingdom , and we believe the world , have been struck blind . There is no government . But there is a bigger threat to us at this time . With me is triffid expert , Dr Bill Masen . Dr Masen , what do people need to know about the triffids ? They 're extremely dangerous . And how are they dangerous ? What do they do ? Well , triffids are large , carnivorous plants that can move independently . But because of the blinding , they 've escaped and so they 're no longer being fed on the farm . They 've started ... They 've started to , um ... We know that they have started to attack and eat people . They have a fatal sting capable of reaching up to 15ft . And they make a distinctive rustling tick-tocking kind of noise . So if you hear or see one , you must keep your distance . Where do you think that the triffids are heading ? They 'll gravitate towards the cities , to where the most abundant source of food is ... .. us . So , if you are sighted , then arm yourselves and do what you can to protect those around you , especially the blind , and ... .. tell anyone that you can . My parents were botanists and they researched the triffids in Zaire . I was six , so I was with them . It was my father that saw , with , um ... .. some genetic modification , the tremendous opportunity for oil production . So he brought them back ? All of this is his fault . Hm . Well , no . He provided us with a cheap , endlessly replaceable , pollution-free source of fuel that solved the energy crisis . He saved the world . Hm . My mother felt differently . Where are they now ? Well , I haven 't seen my father for years . We don 't get on . And my mother ... she died in Zaire ... .. of a triffid sting . Billy ! DISTANT CRIES , SHOUTS AND EXPLOSIONS This really is it , isn 't it ? I 'm afraid so . To the future . No . To the past . It was beautiful ... and we didn 't take care of it . Hello ? Who are you ? I 'm from MI5 . I 'd like to see the Prime Minister . This is where he lives , isn 't it ? You 'll need to make an appointment . Of course . Hilda . Who are you ? I 'm Torrence . I 'll just have a look round . But you can 't ... Excuse me . Excuse me ! SOBBING You OK ? Yeah . Yeah . I 'm brilliant . I 'll be next door . You know what ? If it 's all the same , would you stay in here ? Morning , Hilda . You can 't stay here . Well ... the PM 's not coming back , I take it . Out running the country ? He 's gone . They all have . Well , then there 's just you and me . There must be others . There 's an emergency broadcast on the radio . Well , play it for me , Hilda . 'With me is triffid expert , Dr Bill Masen . 'Dr Masen , what do people need to know about the triffids ? 'They 're extremely dangerous . 'And how are they dangerous ? 'What do they do ? Well , triffids are large , carnivorous plants that can move independently . 'But because of the blinding they ... ' Haven 't got anything to eat , have you ? A sandwich ? I 'll make it . Then we can go for a little drive . Hm ? Jo . Jo , wake up . Just saw two flares coming from the city . A signal ? Yeah . This means there 's other people . People like us . People who can see . Triffids . Yeah , they 're moving faster than I thought . They 're only a couple of miles from the city . Bill , who is that ? Hello . Hi . I 'm Torrence . Heard on the radio there 's a bit of panic developing about triffids . Judging from the mess here , I think they 're right . Help yourself to guns . We could do with some weapons . I 'm Jo . Are you on your own ? Why do you ask ? We 're going to the city . We believe there 's a sighted group there . Tell you what , why don 't you come and join my group ? Who 's in it ? Me . I think we 're fine on our own . OK . See you down the road . Torrence ? Yeah ? How come you can see ? Luck . I 'm a naval engineer . Military submarines . Got caught doing a routine maintenance when all that went up . People I was with ... Well ... Enjoy the weather . Jo ... Enchante . Seatbelt on , please , Hilda . Is this justice ? To leave the rest of your fellow citizens in the dark ? Do you think you 're special ? These people aren 't good enough ? Where 's your British sense of fair play ? Look at them ! Are we supposed to just stand by and let them die ? We have to help . I 've done everything I can to keep these people fed and safe . But I can 't do it on my own ! Everyone who can see can easily look after those who can 't . One day they 'll find a cure and these people will find out who helped and who looked away . These people have every right to live , the same as you ! That 's enough . You and your friends must move along . We 're not going anywhere . Come on , guys . Release her . My men will shoot . Shoot the blind ? You wouldn 't dare . Over their heads , one round . Leave or the next ones will hit . Don 't you have any compassion ? You don 't deserve to have your sight . None of you do . It 's not over . What should we do ? I need to know if these people can help . Go ahead . Crawl in there with the rest of the cowards . There are 30 of us so far , all sighted and another ten highly-skilled , blind . We expect more will come . And we have our own generator . Who are you ? Michele Beadley . I work for the Home Office . So there is still a government ? No . Just us . If you want to join us , you 'll have to pull your weight . Do what , exactly ? To forage for essential supplies . The colonel has lists of what we need . And what plans have you made to defend yourselves against the triffids ? I 'm more concerned about our nuclear power stations , Mr Masen . It 's Dr Masen , and nuclear power stations can 't move , triffids can . The triffids will stay on the farms . They won 't and they 're not . Excuse me ? I 've read the official research . In the event ... That research was commissioned by the Triffoil companies . Triffids need food , meat . If it 's not there , they 'll go and get it . And the biggest available source of food is us . They 're large , slow , easy to avoid . Not if you 're blind . Triffids have been modified to die within three years and the male plants are under strict control on the farms . Kingston Farm was sabotaged and the male plants have escaped . And when they start to pollinate the females it will be catastrophic . Which will take what , months , weeks ? It could be days . Well , whatever emergency plans there were , they clearly can 't be implemented . Therefore our priorities remain as food , fuel , weapons and accommodation . And what about the triffids ? Well , you 're the expert . What would you do ? Don 't worry . I promised to look after you and I will , one way or another . Yeah . I 'm Torrence . I 'm Steve . Hi . Cory . Hi . You better meet Major Coker . Major Coker . I 'm Torrence . Torrence , hey . I was driving . I saw you . Need any help ? You bet . The blind won 't survive on their own . So we 're planning to round up all the sighted we can , if they want to help or not . Have you seen Dr Masen ? No . Let 's come to order . OK , let 's begin . We face what happened to Britain when the Romans left , 1600 years ago . Everything will crumble - roads , railways , hospitals . This is our proposal . We find somewhere in the country and then we start to rebuild . Have you had news from other countries ? Is there any help on its way ? We think what happened here happened everywhere . We 're not expecting any help from outside . And what about the blind ? I 'm afraid we have no plans for them . What ? We have no alternative . We are too few , they are too many . We can 't look after them . We can 't feed them . I see no way to save them . And no point in dying with them . It 's wrong . It 's so wrong . Bill ? You 're leaving ? Where are you going ? To my father 's place in Shirning . I 've got to work out how to deal with them . Well , you 'd better go then . Look , it 's not my first choice ... it 's my only choice . You know , I 'm clutching at straws . He may not even have survived . I don 't know . His original research , it might help . But we 're running out of time . I 'm coming with you . Jo . Jo ... you might not agree with Beadley , but you 'll have a much better chance of survival if you stay with her . She 's wrong . What they 're doing is ruthless . Jo , you need people . I don 't need these people . You 'll be safer with her . Jo ... we were an accident . Oh ... We met by accident but ... we stayed together on purpose , didn 't we ? TASER BUZZES I 'll get the gate ! Remember , tear gas and smoke grenades only ! I don 't want to hurt them ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Tear gas ! Get off ! Jo . Get off me ! Bill ! Agh ! Get off me ! Get off me ! Bill ! Torrence ! Get him out of here ! Bill ! Take him out ! Take him out ! Bill . Yeah , turn around . Yeah , look at me . Look at me . Look at me . Can you stand ? Yeah . Attention , all sighted . Each of you will be handcuffed to a blind citizen . It is now your job to keep them alive . I 'm Jeff . Sorry about all this . Don 't be . It 's not your fault . I used to be a mechanic . Weren 't a bad old life as long it lasted . Well , I guess I 'm one of the lucky ones . Why , because you can still see ? Rather you than me , mate . Sorry about the strong-arm tactics , but you weren 't going to help us . Coker , what 's going on ? You 've been split into groups . The sighted will take care of the blind . Make sure they have food and shelter . We 're going to divide London into sections . And what do you plan to do in these sections ? I mean , about the triffids ? The triffids aren 't our priority . Yeah , well , they should be . We 've seen what they can do and so has he . What matters now is organization . What 's your role in all of this ? My role ? I thought you said you were on your own . Then I met Major Coker . His plan to take over London interests me . Sorry , Jo . All right . Guides will take you to your sections . Let 's load up , guys . Look after Hilda for me , Joe ! We got to load the trucks . Double time , everybody . Torrence , come on , help out . Guides will lead you to your sections . Let 's load up . Here we go . I 'll get moving when I 'm good and ready . Get in the truck . Here we go . 'Coker sent sighted and blind to forage for food and water . 'His heart was in the right place , but he was ignoring the threat of 'the encroaching triffids , delaying me from getting to Shirning 'and the solution I was hoping to find there . ' Everybody out ! Move it , people ! Come on ! You and you , you 're coming with me . Let 's do it . Where are we going ? We 're going in ! In the door ! All right ! All right ! Come on ! I 'm going ! I 'm going ! Anybody in ? What 's that ? Who 's here ? Nice and easy . Watch your backs . Wouldn 't want to see you get hurt . Don 't shoot ! Come on . Come on . Come on . Son of a ... Put that down ! You stupid idiot ! No ! All right . There 's no food here ! We 're taking over your pub , psycho . What 's your name ? Vronsky . You got to pay . We don 't got to do nothing . What you doing , you ... prat ? RUSTLING That 's disturbing . What is it ? It 's triffid recordings . Something I 've been working on . Discover anything interesting ? Maybe . As long as it isn 't attracting them to us . I thought Major Coker said they weren 't important ? Major Coker wants to talk to you , Jo . Me ? Why ? Read your name off the list . Realised you were behind the emergency broadcast . He 'd like you to do another . It seems you 're the famous Jo Playton . I always thought there was something special about you . No , I just work on the radio , that 's all . Well , that 's the thing . See , Major Coker was in the US Air Force . Appreciates the , er ... the importance of clear communication . Good for Major Croker , but tell him I 'm fine where I am . Look , Jo , people know your voice . We think we can get a transmitter going and you can talk to the people . You can reassure the afflicted , just like you 're doing with Hilda . Yeah , well , thanks for the offer , but like I said , I 'm fine where I am . You heard what she said , Torrence . OK . Major Coker 's going to be very disappointed . Seems you prefer hanging out with Dr Masen than saving your country . Charlie ... right here , buddy . Jackpot . Everybody out . How 'd you know about this place ? Charlie led us here . I worked here half my life before the blinding . Night watchman . Not much of a night watchman now . All right , Osman . Rope up . Coker ... Coker . Will you shut up about the triffids and help ? Charlie , you 're the watchman . Stay here and watch . Three groups . Osman , Cheryl , Vronsky , get water . Jo , Hilda , canned goods . Bill , medical supplies . Got it ? What d 'you think ? Keep your eyes open . That supposed to be funny ? Hey , Torrence , come in . It 's Coker . Reading you , Major . We need you to come to the warehouse and give us back-up . This place is full of supplies . Understood . We 're going to need a bigger car . So what was it like being a star ? Shut up , Hilda . Vronsky , come on . Make it quick . Oh , yeah ... Coker ? Coker ? Stay here . What 's this ? Jeez ... Agh . What 's that smell ? Rotting meat . Would someone tell me what 's happ ... ? Be quiet ! Triffids . SHE SCREAMS Where are you going ? To get Jo . SHE SCREAMS Charlie ? Charlie , are you there ? Charlie ! Come on ! Argh ! Osman ? ! Anyone ? ! My arm ! Help ! No ! No ! No ! Right here ! SCREAMING No ! No ! Agh ! No ! SCREAMING No ! No ! Agh ! SCREAMING Get back ! Agh ! Come on ! Come on , let 's go ! My leg ! Ow ! I think it 's broken . Ow ! Please ! Shut up . Don 't leave me ! Osman ? Osman ? Osman ! Don 't leave me ! Osman ! Come on , faster ! Faster ! Faster ! SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE Agh ! My leg ! They just left me . Come on , help ! Come on ! She 's gone . Jo , she 's gone . Come on ! Ow ! Get her in the van ! Is this what you wanted ? Is it ? Is this what you wanted ? ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I should have listened . You 've got to get to Shirning , with or without me . Hey ! Your man Osman is a coward . And I want Bill Masen on our team . You get him whatever he needs to deal with the triffids . Of course , mate . Excellent idea . Leave it to me . Come on . OK , kids ... We 're leaving . Jo , you OK ? I 'm all right . But if it wasn 't for Bill , I wouldn 't even be here now . Yes , he 's quite the hero , isn 't he ? And he 's our only hope against the triffids . Er , you wanted to see me ? I did . About the radio broadcast for Major Coker . I changed my mind . And if there 's anything I can do to help , I 'd like to do it before Bill and I leave for his father 's . Well ! Um ... He will be delighted . What would be fantastic is if you could record something right now . Right now ? Yeah . OK . Excellent . After you . Hi , Jeff . What are you doing ? I 'm leaving . Does Coker know ? I 'm going to see him now . Ah . 'Hello . This is Radio Britain and I 'm Jo Playton coming to you live from London . ' Please listen carefully to the following announcement . Triffids are now known to have reached major cities across the country . As you know , these plants can and will kill humans .

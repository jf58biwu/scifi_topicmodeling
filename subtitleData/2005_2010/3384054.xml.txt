 ( Mohinder ) previously on heroes ... Find claire bennet . Bring her back to me . You think you can do that ? Yes , sir , of course i can . I 'm coming too . Isaac mendez is dead . This is the last posthumous issue . But it 's not the last story . The day that he died , Isaac mendez bequeathed his sketchbook To a humble bike messenger . You find that messenger , You find your story . ( Nathan ) it 's got nothing to do with dad . I 'm going to pinehurst . His idea , Giving people abilities , The right people . It 's wrong . It 's not wrong . It 's so right . [ Sandra screams ] ( Sylar ) we 're taking claire with us . That 's what we came for in the first place . Well , i 've read your files , gabriel . You 're not their son . They 're just leveraging your mommy issues And turning you into their weapon . And i understand now That i 'm never gonna change . Theoretically this formula is sound , But something is missing , Some kind of catalyst . The key component of this catalyst Would live in a human host . I think i 'm the catalyst . That 's claire , and that 's hiro hiding behind the ferns . I think hiro has to take claire here To get his memory back . Jan ( Ando ) hiro ! Jan [ Clears throat ] What did you do ? What the hell is going on ? Jan Dad ? Jan That baby 's me . You 're hiro nakamura , aren 't you ? Jan Peter told me about you . You 're a time traveler , So you brought me back in time . Why did you bring me here ? Jan You don 't speak english ? Jan Jan Oh , look . Is that you ? Am i here for you ? Jan Jan Where is train station ? I must use toilet . More waffles , please . Hiro . Jan Jan Jan Hey , where are you going ? Should i stay with me , or should i go with you ? Hey , what am i supposed to do ? [ Woman laughing ] Jan Jan Jan Our son can hear us . Speak english . Are you feeling better ? We must face the inevitable . I am dying . I think it will happen tonight . We must make arrangements For the catalyst Before it is lost forever . The catalyst . Jan Jan Jan Are you sure ? Nothing will ever be the same . You must think of the future , kaito . I will have noah return with the baby . She is the perfect candidate . I wanted to keep it in the family . Absolutely not . Our son couldn 't possibly . Jan Jan Jan This conversation isn 't over yet . Jan Jan Jan [ Chuckling ] Jan I know what i have to do . I think i can stop the catalyst Before they put it in me . I can be a hero . I don 't understand what you 're saying . I have to follow my dad , protect that baby , So they don 't inject the catalyst into me . I 'll meet you here tonight . Stay out of trouble , okay ? Okay . Jan Jan Jan Jan Jan Jan [ Seagulls cawing ] [ Cell phone rings ] What ? You were supposed to be here by now . Where 's claire ? Gone into thin air . What happened ? Don 't know , don 't care . I 'm not helping you anymore , arthur . I 'm not helping anyone . I talked to bennet . He told me everything . He told me you 're not my father . I want the truth . And i know exactly where i 'm gonna find it . I 've got a whole new list of people with abilities . It 's gonna be very useful . Don 't do this . Come see me . Don 't worry , i will . Very soon . Good-Bye , elle . [ Dramatic music ] ? One shot to the back of his head And it 's done . You want me to kill him ? Why do you think i sent you and your brother To find the haitian ? He makes arthur vulnerable . And now that nathan Has switched his allegiance , It 's all up to you . Your father is far too powerful . He won 't be contained . If the tables were turned , He would not hesitate to put a bullet in your brain , Or nathan 's . Why do you think i poisoned him , The man i loved , Father of my children ? He tried to kill your brother . And if you get in his way , he will destroy you . You don 't know that . I know that he will stop at nothing To get what he wants By any means necessary , no matter who gets hurt . There 's no other way . [ Cocks gun ] So d.O.D. Is on board . We 're all set . ( Arthur ) well done , tracy . Nathan , nice to see you . What are you doing here ? It 's my job , senator- - Finding opportunities for you . Have you reconsidered my offer , son ? I agree with what you 're trying to do . The world 's a dangerous place and it 's not getting any better . We need a leader , somebody with vision . And that somebody isn 't you . Is it you ? I 'm taking over pinehurst , The complete program . I 'll work out of my office . We can use my resources . Who do you think you 're talking to ? I made you . You wouldn 't have gone To all this trouble to make me If you didn 't need me . You wanted a legitimate face for pinehurst , A person with authority . Senator nathan petrelli . All right , nathan . You win . Brief him on what we 've done . ( Tracy ) you 're angry . What do you expect ? You went behind my back . You 're supposed to be working for me . That 's exactly what i was doing . We 're on your side , nathan . Your father sees the problems in this world- - War , terrorism . He wants to make it a better place . You have no idea who my father is . I know he 's crossed some lines , But he has a vision for the future , And you 're in it as president of the united states . That is where you belong , nathan . And i belong there with you . We 'd like to call it " intelligent design . " Until now abilities have been random , Given to good people and bad , Whether they deserve them or not . When we perfect the formula , We get to choose who gets what power . And we have chosen the best . Meet the future . ( Commander ) fall in ! A-Ten-Hut ! [ Baby cooing ] Okay , almost there . Hang in there . Oh , gosh . [ Sandra groaning ] Come on . Hang in there . Okay , here we go . Oh , my gosh , let me help you . Oh , thanks . Oh , my husband bailed on me . Our first day with an adopted baby , And he had to go back to work . Oh , my gosh , thank you . No worries . I 'm bonnie , by the way . I 'm staying next door with the monacos . I 'm their niece .

There we go , little one . Oh , wow . There we go . I 'm so glad i ran into you . To be honest , i 'm a little overwhelmed . She 's so little . And i 'm completely unprepared . I don 't have a clue about how to take care of a baby . Well , i have a feeling you 'll do just fine . Besides , i have major babysitting skills . I could teach you a thing or two if you want . That would be great . What about your husband , is he good with kids ? Not really . Noah 's very busy at work . He just got a promotion . Apparently he is , um- - He 's very good at what he does . I 'll bet he is . All done . There we go . Thank you . There we go . Oh , it 's so strange . I 've only known claire a few hours , And i 'm so in love with her . I think she knows that . Yeah . Don 't let her out of your sight , okay ? What do you mean ? Oh , i just mean that She 's gonna grow up really fast . Believe me , i am gonna watch her like a hawk . Hi , baby girl . [ Phone ringing ] Hey , sue , is it really your birthday ? ( Man ) hey , birthday girl ! Sue landers ? Special delivery . [ Ringing sound ] You 're lying . You 're not here to make a delivery . Impressive . How did you do that ? What do you want ? To understand what you do . Human lie detector , how does that work ? When someone tells a lie , does it tingle ? How did you know about me ? Who are you ? Someone who covets your ability . I have to find out the truth about something . No , you don 't . Trust me . I 'm sure it 's hard , Seeing the ugly truth at every turn . It must make it hard to trust anyone . [ Panting ] Shh . It 's not gonna hurt a bit . [ Ringing sound ] Got me . That 's a lie . [ Screaming ] I almost forgot how good this feels . ( All ) happy birthday ! Cake . Tell me what you know about this program . It 's gonna make us better marines , sir . Yeah . But how ? Not exactly sure . Some kind of drug . I 'm told it 's safe . Sergeant , i want you to know Exactly what it is you 've signed up for . The drug that we 're developing , It 'll change your life In ways you can 't possibly imagine . Forever . I get it , sir , but i have my reasons . I did two tours in iraq . In the last mission , last tour , Rpg took out our humvee Three klicks south of kirkut . Boatload of hadjis has us pinned down , And we fought as best we could . End of the day though , 12 of us went in , only 2 came out . That 's tough . The trip back to stateside , I couldn 't help thinking , " Why couldn 't i have been better ? " You 're being too hard on yourself , marine . Everybody says that . You 're only human . If only i was more than that , Maybe they 'd still be alive , you know ? Yeah , i think i do . I like teleporting better . Less windy . I don 't care where you are . Hey . It should been there an hour ago . They 're ready . Get it to them . Excuse me , we 're looking for a messenger . Sure , pal , what do you need delivered ? We need to find something , someone .

Just look it up . His name was isaac mendez . M-E-N-D-E- - Look , i would like to help . City regulations prevent me from talking about deliveries . There 's no city regulation About that . What are you , a cop ? He knows something , matt . Right . Sorry to do this to you , buddy . He does know about the sketches . Wait , how do you know that i know ? I also know that you 're skimming off the top . What , $ 5,200 already this year . Whoa . Give us the sketches now . Okay , fine . I got it in the back . It 's in the safe . I 'll go get it . That 's a great idea . We found them . Hey , you 've been a good friend to hiro , nemesis . How come ? Well , it 's kinda my fault . I mean , i started this whole mess stealing the formula- - No , no , no , it 's more than that . You 're doing it because that 's the right thing to do , And that 's who you are . Guys . ( Ando ) he 's getting away . He 's got the sketchbook . We have to stop him . Allow me . [ Horns honking ] ( Man ) hey , watch it ! ( Woman ) watch out ! What the- - ? Fine , i give . 16 years ago [ Coughs ] J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J Remember , fifth grade a boy named danny .

I was just watching the baby while sandra set up the nursery . ( Sandra ) hi , hon . I thought i heard you come in . How 's work ? You left the baby alone with some strange girl ? She 's not strange . Bonnie , this is mr . Bennet . She 's a potential new babysitter for us . Is there a problem ? [ Whispering ] you can 't let a stranger come in our home Under any circumstances . Don 't worry , claire . I 'm here to protect both of us . Something wrong ? Tell me who you are again . I 'm the monacos ' niece . The monacos don 't have a niece . So i 'm gonna ask you one last time . Who are you ? And what the hell do you want ? ( Claire ) you don 't understand . I 'm here to protect her and this family . Who sent you ? What 's going on , noah ? Nothing ; just go on back in the bedroom . Does this have something to do With how we got the baby ? No questions . That was the arrangement . Please , just go sit in the bedroom and wait . I 'll take the baby . No , everything is fine , sandra . Please , just go . I know you 're scared . You 're a company man . And this little baby is your assignment . You 're thinking , how can she possibly Be your daughter when they could Take her away from you at any moment ? You 're trying so hard , But you can 't let yourself love her . What is this ? Are you one of them ? Are you a mind reader ? Something like that . Believe me , this little baby Will be in your life for at least 16 more years . And many more hopefully after that . She 's gonna need you to protect her From so many things , Terrible things . But you 're gonna love each other so much . How do you know all this ? [ Phone ringing ] No , don 't answer that . Why not ? It 's the company , okay ? They want to take her back just for a minute .

What ? No , i 'm fine . You know , i was just thinking It 's too bad the eclipse had to end . The world be a lot simpler without powers . To kill one 's own father is a horrible thing . He tried to kill my brother . He took away my powers . He 'd kill me if he had to . But he didn 't . You and i both know The world isn 't safe with my father in it . But i also know you , peter . You want to save the world . You always have . It 's that part of you that wants to save your father . Give the gun to me . I 'll do it . No . Just like your brother was your responsibility . This one is mine . [ Easy listening music plays ] ? Something wrong ? No . [ Ringing sound ] No . Hmm . Does kind of tingle . ? I found it in some guy 's locker After he got canned . I had no idea how much it was worth . Every fanboy in the city 's been trying to grab it . My life 's been a living hell . I don 't understand . This is how it ends ? What 's happened to hiro ? ( Matt ) maybe it 's not so bad . Right . Maybe this is just the cover to get people to buy it . Hiro will come back . He has to . [ Sighs ] [ Door opens ] Cheerleader , it 's over . We can go home now . Hey , you speak english . I thought that- - It 's a long story . Just know that i have taken the catalyst . The light is in me now . We have saved the future . Wait , you put the catalyst in you ? Guess i showed up just in time . Keep away , arthur petrelli . I will save the cheerleader again . I don 't think so . I 'll take the catalyst and your powers too , hiro . You 're a dead man . [ Screaming ] No ! Hiro . As for you , I need you to deliver a message For me . Tell angela it 's over . I 've won . [ Hiro screaming ] Cheerleader ! Hello ? ! Anybody there ? Help ! Help . Please . ( Ando ) i can 't believe it . Hiro 's stuck back in time 16 years ago and no powers . Maybe it isn 't all bad news . Arthur petrelli has the catalyst . He could perfect the formula . Yeah , wait , he- - He can give people powers . So that means that there could be another time traveler . Someone to save hiro . Maybe it could be me . I can go back in time And save hiro . We 've got to find the formula . How do we find the formula ? [ Dramatic music ] ? Doctor . Ready to change the world ? I.D. Please . We 'll need 50 doses to begin- - One for every marine ? We 'll just try it on one first . Let 's make sure this thing works . No offense . What is it ? Nothing . Just a minor inconvenience . Call your first marine . I 'll be back . Peter . I 'm glad you 're here . Nathan and i have just been- - Don 't be ridiculous . So ... You 're here to kill me . I 'm here to stop you . Creating abilities like this , Giving them out , It 'll destroy the world . In your opinion . I 've seen it . This ends now . I don 't think you have the nerve to kill me , peter . [ Cocks gun ] ( Tracy ) i like your choice . Very all-American . We could put him on a poster . Where 's my father ? We don 't need him . You 're in charge , remember ? All right , let 's do this . What the hell happened to you ? A mistake . Hopefully this formula will fix all that . What 's in there ? It 's all right , scott . Who is this guy ? ! What 's happening ? I 'm not sure . He 's too strong . I cannot hold his powers back . Listen to me , son . There is another way . The formula is ready . Nathan is here . I can give you your abilities back . We can start over . No . Peter ! Wait . Just wait . That your problem , son . Too much thought . Not enough action . How could you be my son ? Hello , arthur . Gabriel , you 're here . I am . No place i 'd rather be than with family . Are you really my family ? Of course . I 'm your father . [ Ringing sound ] No , you 're not . Now i know the truth . You 're not a killer , peter . I am . There 'll be no need for that . I 'm not gonna kill you . You don 't have anything i need anymore . ( Haitian ) i 'm sorry , peter . Your father was the one who had to die . Go after sylar . It 's over . [ Groaning ] [ Hyperventilating ] ( Mohinder ) how do you feel ? I feel good .

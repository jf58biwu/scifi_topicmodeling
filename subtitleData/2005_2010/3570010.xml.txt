 'My name 's Maria Jackson , and this is Bannerman Road . 'I 've just moved in with my dad after he and my mum got divorced . ' Oh , right , on the brush . You 've got some on your face . There , just there . Then , in this big old house over the road , I met Sarah Jane Smith . She 's a journalist ... who investigates aliens . That 's Luke . Born yesterday , near enough . Sarah Jane 's adopted him , and together , we saved the world . I discovered that life was so much bigger and stranger and better than I ever thought possible . Oi ! Thank you . Don 't do anything I wouldn 't do . But when school began , I thought things might go back to normal . I was wrong . They just got weirder ... .. and weirder ... .. and weirder . Wahhhh ! Now , you take care . OK ? Goodbye , Mum . Oh , I don 't think so . No , Sarah Jane 's just fine . Oh , hi , Maria . CHILDREN LAUGH Why were they laughing ? First day , and your mum 's kissing you goodbye ? Is that bad ? Bit embarrassing . Plus , she so wants you to call her Mum . She said she didn 't . It 's not what she said . That 's a bit flashy . It 's a brand new building . There was an article about it in the paper . Wonder what 's inside it ? Not them . Scan along . Where is he ? There ! Him . He 's not that big . How will I fit ? He 'll do . Get yourself ready . I 'll go fetch . What can I do for you ? Stand right there , Tim . Any particular reason ? Very particular . HE BREAKS WIND Oops ! Happens to us all . And I 'll need those . Sorry ? Waaaaahhhhh ! I 'm feeling anxious . So am I. But you 've been to school before . Not this one . Budge up . You new today ? Yeah . Maria . Clyde . New too . Probably hang around with you till I meet some cooler people . How do you do ? I 'm Luke Smith . OK , that was a joke . Now I mean it . Good morning everybody . ALL : Good morning , Mr Blakeman . HE BREAKS WIND , EVERYONE LAUGHS What 's funny ? The wife gave me cabbage and bean tartlets last night . Yet another reason to despise Jamie Oliver . Welcome back everybody , it 's a new year , hope you all do well . Don 't run in the courtyard , don 't even think of wearing make-up , and study hard , because I guarantee none of you are gonna be pop stars . What 's his problem ? So ... . What else ? HE BREAKS WIND Oh , yeah . What a bright future you 've all got , children of the world ! Etcetera . Right ... as you 've seen , we have a new technology block . I 'll be taking you over in groups to look at our amazing new facilities , starting with ... Form 10B . There are 16 classrooms with broadband connections , but anything dubious your adolescent minds may be drawn to , I 've locked out . I 've signed us up for this . First meeting 's tomorrow . Lunchtime science club ? And now I 'm backing away . HE BREAKS WIND Shut up ! Why is farting funny ? It just is . But it 's a normal process of the human bowel . Are you for real ? Smells weird in here . Farts ? Dunno ... metal , electric . Like batteries . Can I sit here ? Only if I 'm not gonna shame you . Well , I either sit here with you or sit there with that . What , there 's someone worse than me ? Just . So where are you from ? Hounslow . My parents split up , so I moved here with Mum . Like me . Only I moved with my dad . Yeah , how 's that ? Better than them rowing all the time . Yeah . Ow ! What 's wrong with that ? It 's mouldy ! What kind of slop are they serving here ? Is it leftovers from last term or something ? Sir ? Sir ? What ? How am I meant to eat that ? Just pick the bad bits off . Great . That leaves me with a pea . Mine 's off too ! That is disgusting ! What 's wrong with this place ? It stinks , the food 's rotten . Something weird 's going on here . Goodbye , repellent pubescents . Until tomorrow . This skin ... it 's killing me round the legs . Right . Time for a test run . Now ? What about the caretaker ? I 've taken care of the caretaker . Everything 's ready . Come on ! Oh , I see , you 've cadged a lift , have you ? I offered . I dunno , Lady Muck , getting the neighbours to chauffeur her around . Shut up , Dad . How was the first day , then ? OK . A bit weird , though . The headmaster keeps farting . Really ? What , noisy smelly ones or silent but deadlies ? Eugh ! What ? Place stinks like batteries . And the food was off . I 'll make you a proper tea . You go and get changed . Bye . See you , Maria . I want a proper tea too ! Make it yourself ! I 'm not your cook . Whatever . No , forget it , it 's all right . We 'll phone out for a curry . Can 't have you straining yourself after your long voyage home , can we ? You think you 're so funny ! Yeah . How do you get like that , you and Maria ? Always been like that , don 't really think about it . Anyway , the school can 't be that bad , they 've just built this . Someone donated the money and this technology block was put up . Looks incredible . Hold on . I did an IT job in a school , in a new block that looks like that . Was it built by Coldfire Construction ? Yeah . Where ? On the other side of town . St Sheldon 's , in Upminster . That place smelt odd . Sort of metallic . Anyway , better go . Stop her ordering the entire menu . Bye ! Systems online . That 's it . Now , synchronise the mega-wattage . Synchronizing mega ... watty ... er ... That one ! Kept making social mistakes today . I think I made one too . Driving to school when it 's round the corner , kissing you goodbye . Oh , we 're both new hands at this . I don 't know anyone except Maria and Clyde . Maria 's in different classes to me most of the time . And Clyde thinks I 'm uncool . Clyde 's not the only kid in the school . What if I make more mistakes ? Never make the same ones again . Listen , anyone is nervous starting a new school , a new job . I 've never been a mum before . Do I have to go ? I could take you out , teach you here . I considered it . But you , Luke Smith , you 're going to live a normal life , as normal a life as I can give you . What if I get it wrong again ? It makes me feel ... stupid . Remember , you saved the world the day you were born . Not many people can say that . No-one else can say that . That 's the problem . Nobody else is like me . What are you doing ? Checking up on the firm who built your new block . Coldfire Construction . They started expanding 18 months ago , contracts all round the world . Some odd things cropping up . Now they 're putting up school buildings all round London . Makes a change for me . Not aliens , is it ? Stabilising ... There ! Aaah ! Only me , come for a gawp . Alan , this is really kind of all right ! Thanks , Chrissie , I really value your opinion . Don 't be sarky . Is Maria upstairs ? I think it went OK for her today . What went OK for her today ? Her first day at the new school . Today ? My mind 's just been all over the place , stress like you would not believe . So why did you come round ? To see my daughter . Do I need another reason ? Oh , while I think about it , you were gonna give me that 13.5 tog double duvet ? Only you don 't need it , you 've got the single . Maria , love , it 's your mum ! Lights out , London ! School can 't be that bad . I mean , like I said , it 's a much better catchment area . Ooh , got to go , love . Ivan 's taking me to the pub , it 's opera night . The waiters sing while you 're eating . Oh , great ( ! ) There 's a torch . With a flat battery . I 'm not saying anything I 'll get the candles . Power cut ? Yes , Mr Smith 's not responding . The computer just went pffft , and guess who forgot to save her work ? I 'll just see how long it 'll be , I can check the local power grid . That 's impossible . It never loses power . Can 't lose power . There we go . Goes as far as I can see . Happened all the time when I was a kid . It once went off right in the middle of Manimal , I was distraught . Weird . Why 's that happening ? Give them to me ! I can do it . No , I 'll do it . What was that ? It 's destabilising hell ! Turn it off , turn it off ! Turn it off ! What ? Weird . Must be faulty . Or the same thing that cut the electric off cut this off . Fantastic ( ! ) Every station in the loop is working , but the stabiliser cuts out ! I 'll fix it . You bought those plans off that Wallarian , you took his word it worked ! I 'll sort out the storage problem , then it 'll stabilise , OK ? Until then I 'm stuck here , in this . Teaching science on the planet Thick where they still haven 't worked out string theory ! Ooh , it chafes ! Oh , shut up ! Don 't you get it ? We 're nearly there ! One more step ... and we destroy this planet ! Science is my first class today . Lab 2A , with Mr Jeffrey . You 'll be fine ! See you , then . Oh , hi . Oh , not interrupting ? No , no , no . Just making a start . Had a bigger garden in the old house . Do you miss it ? Yeah , well , needs must and all that . Shame , I had a lot of plans for that old garden . Just didn 't plan on my wife running off with a judo instructor . You ever been married ? No . Never found time . Wise move . Anyway ... sorry ? Oh , I was just wondering , that school you mentioned in Upminster . St Sheldon 's ? I 'm sure I 've still got the plans here somewhere . Yeah , there we go . Cost a fortune . They had broadband installed , the works . Where did the money come from ? I dunno , private funding . What sort of journalist are you ? Oh , local stories , nothing exciting . Maria was saying you 'd travelled a fair bit ? Could say that , yeah . What 's that bit ? It 's blank . Never went in . Coldfire kept that to themselves , it was sealed off . There 's no door . You reckon they 're hiding something , do you ? Ooh , something mysterious inside a school . That would be ridiculous ! A bit . Do you mind if I keep this ? No . A transformer is an electrical device that changes the voltage of the AC supply . Such as your ... our mains electrical supply . Anybody know who invented the first transformer ? .. You . Faraday . Correct . Though he didn 't know what to use it for . What ? I 've thought about it too . You could get rid of the transformers , get a better system and induct power instead . Just pointing out , I 'm nothing to do with him . Quiet ! Name . Clyde Langer . Troublemaker . Noted . OK . You 're cool because you make trouble . Should I make trouble ? I hear talking ! run out , I 'm getting a new one . Let me see that . Oh ! What is it ? Cold chip sandwich . Made it this morning . Not chancing my life in that canteen again . Oi , you can 't do that ! You can wait until lunchtime and use the canteen like everybody else . I 'll report you for that ! Go on , try it . HE BREAKS WIND PUPILS LAUGH , BELL RINGS Right . For tomorrow , 1,000 words on transformers ! Oh ! 2,000 ! Hopeless , Miss Smith ! Even worse this term . I believe you had the wiring in your new block re-installed . keep crashing . And look . Look at this . Fresh this morning . Everything goes off . And there 's that smell . Like batteries . And it started when you got your new technology block ? Hasn 't anyone tried to work out what 's wrong ? a parent governor raised it at our meeting . And ? Fell off his bike the next morning , three months in traction . Can 't you feel it , Miss Smith ? Like ... a thunderstorm 's coming . Hello , Miss Smith . SHE LAUGHS Incredible knowledge ! This child , Luke Smith , is a freak . You really think he can help us ? Yes ! We 'll use him to solve the storage problem . A 14-year-old human ? Something 's strange about him . These kids stink . Acne and grease and coats and crisps . But he smells ... fresh . When can you get to him ? Very soon . We have a rendezvous . Welcome to lunchtime science club . I had hoped for a slightly higher turnout , but never mind . There 's only me . And me . Carl . Luke . Pleased to meet you . Hi . Carl 's the science star of the school , supposedly . Though I imagine he 's probably pretty rubbish compared to you . Take a look at this . Now , over the summer I 've been having tons of fun working on a new project . What do you make of this ? Um ... It 's a model for a giant capacitor system . Purely theoretical . Nobody could possibly build this for real . You designed this ? Yes , I 'm wasted here . Do you like it ? It 's amazing . Let me see . Now , I have a problem . My purely theoretical problem is ... anyone ? Don 't tell me . Oh , yeah . With this , you could store huge amounts of electrical energy . But there 's a loophole . Here in the storage , it wouldn 't stabilise . That 's my problem , well done . Gold star . No star . You went wrong here . You need to add an equation into the computer control . Yeah ? I 'll take your word for it . The power stabilises , your problems are over . Yes . All my problems are ... I don 't know about yours , though . And that school has exactly the same problem as yours . So I 'm off to Coldfire Construction . Do you want me to do anything ? Yeah , have a look round , see if you can find where that smell 's coming from . OK , see you later . Good luck ! Who was that , then ? Nobody . Result ! Yes ! That 's it ! And he just handed it over ! Hilarious ! Humans ... even the clever ones are stupid ! At last ! We will be avenged ! We 'll finish this planet tonight ! Someone looks happy ! I had double maths this afternoon . Science club was brilliant . Mr Jeffrey 's really nice . I think we 'll be friends . You don 't make friends with a teacher . Why not ? You just don 't . Anyway , Sarah Jane phoned , she wants us to look inside the new block . What are you doing ? Investigating the new block . I left something in the new block . What is it with you and her ? I 've seen weird people , I know weird people . But you two , you 're beyond weird . Go find some normal people then . Can I help you ? That 's not right . I want answers . Where are you from ? doesn 't make any sense . But where 've you been all your life ? You don 't know farting 's funny , you let your mum kiss you in public . Where was your last school ? I 've never been to school . Your mum taught you at home ? No . And she isn 't my mum . There are 16 classrooms in this building . Hold on . What 's Sarah Jane to you ? She adopted me . Why don 't you call her Mum ? She doesn 't want me to . What about your real mum and dad ? I haven 't got a mum or dad . Everybody 's got a mum and dad . I have a dad ... somewhere . This block measures about 1,539 metres squared , so double that for both floors ... The area of each room doesn 't add up to that . So there 's an empty space ... through there ! I think you should go home . So what are you saying about our company then ? Miss ... ? Oh , you can call me Janine . Janine . I 've been reading up . It 's not just these school projects in London . You 've moved from country to country , hiring cheap local labour . Yes ? At your building in Santiago , workers refuse to go in . Food goes off . Endless technical problems . Valencia , Paris , the same story . And another thing . The plans for each building have a large empty area behind a wall . Why is that ? There 's another room , a secret room . Behind there ! I 'll tell you this ... But how do you get inside ? I 'm not getting through . Stop ... being ... strange . Who 's that ? I know you 're in here ... I can smell you . HE SNIFFS Ah , a little girl . Fresh as a daisy . Sugar and spice and all things nice . She really shouldn 't be hanging around school after home time . Not when I 've got no reason to hide in this stupid skin any longer . SQUEAKING because these projects are so far apart , nobody connects them . I strongly advise you to leave right now . If you know what 's good for you . Is that a threat ? Yes . What ? After all ... why should I hide ? That was your last chance , Miss Smith . Be fair . I did give you fair warning ... I am Slitheen ! Oh , I love it when they run ! Your Luke Smith 's too clever by half . He 's right outside ! There 's another one . I 'm after her now . Oh , it feels good , after so long . Rejoice in your hunt , brother ! I know you 're in here , I can smell you . Mmm , what lovely perfume you 're wearing , Miss Smith ! You 're positively fragrant ! We 're out of here , now , come on ! What ? Where 's Luke ? I know you 're out there , girl ... That 's only Mr Jeffrey . And another one ! A boy ! You are sad . Hiding from a teacher . What can he do ? Give you a detention ? Come on ! Oh , no ! Run ! It 's no fun if you don 't run ! The smell of human fear ... love it ! Kiddies ! Kiddywinks ! Run as fast as you can , I 'm coming to find you . Raarghh ! It 's a door . And every door must have a door handle . About here ? Children , children , come to me . We 've gotta get out of here ! We can 't . We need to fight them . Quick , in here ! So , Luke , how d 'you like our little science project ? So where 's Jeffrey ? I heard him . That 's Jeffrey , that thing chasing us . Oh , I 'll believe it , why not ? Thanks . Is there a way out through here ? No . There 's no way out . HE BREAKS WIND Oh , no . Ha-ha-ha ! I am a child of the Slitheen and this is my hunt !

 ( Gary ) Control , the hive is humming . I repeat , the hive is humming . ( Gary ) Control , we have confirmed cloud formation . ( Gary ) I repeat , the cotton is in the gin . ( Joanne ) Roger that . We have minimal winds and a very high ceiling . Looking good . And Gary , can you quit with the metaphors ? You 're driving us crazy . Roger that . [ thunder ] [ walla ] ( male ) Mr. Price , are your writings based on science or apocalyptic sensation ? ( Charlie ) I think the whole science community is missing the big picture . ( Charlie ) Apocalyptic ? Well , maybe a little . And again , that 's what sells these days , doesn 't it ? Remind me to write a book that more women would be interested in something about relationships , or dogs , or both . Can we just finish up ? I 'm starved . And I 'd like to get my nails done before the TV interview tonight . I 'm the one being interviewed , not you but what time is it ? 6 : 00 , why ? No reason . Why ? I have got a date . We just got here . Plenty of time . Remember the Coffee Barista and her nice cappuccinos ? Charlie ! I 'm kidding . She 's an old colleague . Here ? I find it hard to believe . Me too ! Mr. Price . I 've read all your novels . I 'm sorry to hear that . Well , me too . ( reader ) In all of your sensationalistic writings I 've come to find that you 're just as big a hypocrite as the scientific and government establishment that you seek so often to condemn . Really ? How so ? Do you think the solutions offered by any of the characters to any of the disasters in your book are any better than what 's being tried right now ? I don 't know , I 'm not a scientist I 'm a writer who 's blessed with the luxury of dreaming of disasters . I will leave solutions for lab rats . But I read that you were once a lab rat yourself that you left the scientific community . Right ? Who do I make this out to ? [ ominous music ] Hey , guys , I think it 's raining . [ ominous music and rumble of thunder ] [ laughs ] Yes ! Wow ! It is raining . We did it , Jo . [ wind howls ] You should see this . [ intensified wind howling and thunder ] ( Charlie ) You don 't see that everyday . [ alarm sound ] ( Gary ) Guys , we have a situation 14 miles East of here in the town of Harrisford . [ thunder and ominous music intensify ] [ howling wind intensifies ] That 's not good . [ walla and screaming ] What 's taking you so long ? Would you just relax ? I thought I told you to go at the restaurant 10 miles ago . I didn 't have to go then . But you don 't understand how women work once we know we can 't go that 's exactly when we have to go . That makes no sense . Can we drop it ? I 'm done . So is the book signing if we don 't hurry . Hurry ? You 've been driving like my grandma . I 'm hypermiling , okay ? Going 55 miles an hour gets me an extra 50 miles per tank of gas . I don 't care . Just don 't blame me that we 'll miss the book signing . [ howling wind and barking dogs ] Hello ? Our assignment was A Day in the Life of Charlie Price . A day , not 10 minutes , not an hour . Did you see that ? Did you see those clouds ? Those aren 't normal . I 'm gonna get the camera . What are you talking about ? You didn 't see it ? I 'll tell you what I see . I see my future when I fail this class , and it isn 't good . It 's gone . So , let 's go . ( Frank ) What we need to focus on is why the first quarter didn 't perform as well as the third quarter- - ( Frank ) Excuse me one moment , ladies and gentlemen . What is it ? ( Bill ) Our weather sat detected a blip on the radar and your Project Rain Dance- - What is a " blip " ? Yeah , uh- - [ sighs ] It 's a storm . That 's what Rain Dance is supposed to do . Rain Dance is close to 14 miles away from this . [ ominous music ] [ sighs ] Put Damon on the phone . Sorry about that , ladies and gentlemen . [ clears throat ] [ police sirens in background ] Yeah . This can 't be . This can 't be . Let 's just not jump to conclusions . [ phone rings ] Gary , talk to me . ( Gary ) I 've checked the data , it makes no sense . Radar , thermals ? Yes , of course , ULF scan , infrared , we didn 't pick up on anything until after it hit . So what , then ? The computers aren 't telling anything . Keep looking . I 'm looking ! Widen your search . Data doesn 't point to us . Let 's hope not . ( Charlie ) Sure your okay ? ( Nora ) I 'm fine ! Really , I 'm fine . ( Charlie ) They just wanna take a look at the cut . You think I 'm gonna let- - Guys , put a gag in her mouth . ( Charlie ) I 'll meet you there . [ approaching sirens ] ( Charlie ) Joanne Dyson . Are you still trying to save the world one drop at a time or are you just thirsty ? Charlie . So you came to my book signing after all . How thoughtful . There were drinks inside , you know . Yeah , I wasn 't really- - Did you see what happened here ? ( Damon ) Hey , uh , you two know each other ? Yes . Damon , meet Charlie Price . ( Damon ) Yeah , I know who Charlie Price is . I was his research assistant at the university before he became a famous writer . ( Damon ) I didn 't know that . You left science fact for science fiction . Huh ? So why are you here ? I 've always had this uncanny sense for being where the action is . [ phone rings ] Oh , excuse me . It 's Frank . Yeah , Frank , it 's me . Frank sounds important ? He is . What happened here , Charlie ? Just this massive storm cell appeared out of thin air then this guy opened up like Armageddon and in the blink of an eye disappeared . What are you doing here ? And so fast . We picked the storm up on our radars , we raced over as soon as we could . Storm radars . Working on anything related ? No . Pull this leg it 'll play Swanee River . What do you want me to say ? You know I can 't talk . Look , Frank . We just got on the scene . We don 't know anything for sure yet , but- - Relax , Damon . Let 's not jump to any half baked conclusions there 's time to figure out what happened . ( Frank ) The seraphs have a 48 hour cycle the next 24 hours are vital , you know that . [ ominous music ] You made it rain , Damon , let 's not lose sight of that . Yes , sir . And Damon , when you do figure it out , make sure it wasn 't us . You know what I mean ? Yeah , I understand . I 'm just curious why the federal science foundation is in the middle of nowhere , when this happens . We 've been stationed here for three years , you know that . Doing what ? Mostly robotics . Come on , Jo . Sorry about the interruption . Damon Jarwell , I 'm a fan of your books , crazy as that may be . Well , it 's fiction , it 's supposed to be crazy . Like a grown woman in trench coat sifting through puddles with a test tube . Hm . Don 't tell me . Earth worms . Your latest experiment is with mechanical earth worms . Or maybe it 's drainage or maybe it has to do with the freak storm that just tore through this town . I 'm sorry , we got a lot of work to do . I 'm sure you both do . So I take that our dinner plans are off for tonight ? Yes . Sorry , Charlie . Rain check ? No pun intended . I have a TV interview tonight anyway . I can 't wait to tell about all the fun stuff the FSF is doing out here . Earth worm robotics , all that kind of stuff . What 's Frank 's last name ? I 'd love a quote . Don 't do this , Charlie . I can 't help myself . What do you want ? I wanna know what you 're doing . No way . Come on . This conversation is over . I 'm no genius but you come here checking puddles for residual trace elements If I did my own sampling I bet I 'd find heavy oxygen maybe some elevated nitrogen levels or maybe I 'll just find some anti depressants . Trying to make everybody feel good about the economy ? Be careful . You 're smacking a hornet 's nest on this one . That 's a terrible analogy . It 's the truth . Is it ? People died here . This isn 't going away . I 'll make sure of that . Just excuse us for a second . Look , Damon . I know Charlie . He 's a dog with a bone . I 'll bury him and that bone if I have to . This is our entire career . Forget the science community , the news will eat up anything he finds on his own . The only way to control the situation is to keep him close . So ? What 's the verdict ? [ thunder and wind howling ] [ alert sound and suspense music ] Oh , no . No . No . No . Where the heck are they drawing their energy from ? ( Joanne ) Where ? Another storm cell formed . So we 're storm chasers now , huh ? Get in the car ! [ suspense music ] [ thunder ] Ugh ! [ crackling sound ] [ sighs ] No one 's here . Oh , I know . They said the signing ended early . I 'm sure it did . They said something happened . A freak storm or something . Seriously . You 're not gonna talk to me for the rest of the day ? It was your bathroom break . What ? It was your lame hyper gassy thing . Whatever . You 're so immature . We have plenty of bathrooms . You have to go ? Nope . Yup . So what now ? Well , we missed Charlie at the book signing we could go to the TV station and wait from here . Plan ? We 're fine . It must have been something to do with those crazy clouds we found something happened here . Yeah , it 's called weather . It happens in a lot of places . Look . Could we just go and get our failing grade over with ? There you go . What 's that for ? In case you need it on the way . You gotta go ? There it is . Gee , thanks . [ wind howls ] Are you sure this is the right place ? ( Joanne ) This is where Gary said the storms formed . ( Charlie ) What do you expect to find ? Hopefully nothing . See anything ? ( Damon ) We can 't go chasing a little gust of wind now . ( Joanne ) Yes , we can , so we can confirm it wasn 't us that caused it . Gary , we 're here , there isn 't a cloud in the sky . ( Joanne ) What 's causing these cells to form ? I don 't know . They are like ghosts they are coming and going with no rhyme or reason moving through areas of absolutely no frontal activity . ( Joanne ) I 'll tell Damon , I 'm sure Frank would love to hear about ghost storms . What do you want me to say ? Everything is on the table . ( Joanne ) Keep looking , Gary . We have to figure this out . ( Gary ) Okay , fine . Bye . What 's this ? ( Charlie ) Oh ! Cold . What 's wrong ? This water 's freezing . ( Joanne ) Charlie , give me that . I could make a fortune selling this online . Just give it back . What is this ? This is our experiment . The culmination of years of research . Sorry it ended this way . It didn 't end . We 've got about 1,999 more still floating around . Why doesn 't that sound comforting ? What 's it do ? Hold on . This is classified information . Oh , you mean this ? Finder 's keepers . We have more important things to do . If something 's gone wrong it 's because we missed it . We need to challenge what we know with some fresh perspective . Charlie is one of the most brilliant men I 've ever known . I agree . You 're not helping . Look . We need to think out of the box and he could be a zero gravity thinker . [ scoffs ] Him ? Why not ? I 'm feeling lighter already . Fine . Whatever . It 's part of a seraph . It 's a self propelled self sustaining silver iodide generator . They 've been seeding clouds for 50 years that 's nothing new . [ scoffs ] Well , to seed clouds you actually need clouds . Something increasingly rare in drought-plagued regions . Joanne 's technology first makes the clouds . Then it seeds them . It 's revolutionary . But is it incendiary ? What ? This can be a pretty nasty weapon if pointed in the right direction . [ scoffs ] Mr. Conspiracy . Not every government science project is a weapon . Said the blind man to his deaf dog . What ? You can 't make something out of nothing . It 's water . A chemical reaction creates its sounds . Let 's fan out and see if any more dropped out of their formation . [ phone rings ] Hello . Charlie ? It 's me . Nora ! You 're out already . How are you , sweetheart ? I told you it was nothing . Just a bit shaken up . That 's a relief . I 'm gonna head out of town early . I 'm a city girl . Would you like me to take you ? No , you should stay . You love this stuff . Good for a new book . No ? I think I wrote this one already . Make sure you make that interview and we 'll meet up in LA . I 'm not sure that I can . Something 's come up . ( Nora ) It better be the bubonic plague . You are making that interview ! As much as I can 't stand this place the small towns are the foundation of your fan base . Yeah , but Nora- - Charlie , promise me ! I set your alarm 6 : 00 PM . I promise . Bye , Nora . [ sighs ] Charlie ! Damon ! ( Charlie ) Boy , he 's blue . It 's really bad . He 's frozen solid . This is silver poisoning . He 's full of silver iodide . Any idea how this happened ? Okay . This is enough , let 's- - Let 's take the seraph back to the base . Damon get Frank on the line I 'm recommending we abort the test . If you pull the plug now it 'll be bad for the future of the program . People are dead , Damon . We had a hand in this . Whoa . Hang on . You don 't know what 's at stake here . It took us way to long to get this funding to begin with . I understand the ramifications but- - I 'm sorry . I 'll recommend full abort . ( Damon ) Hey , Frank . Talk . The second storm is confirmed . Our fingerprints are all over it . Any idea why this is happening ? Not yet , but we found a downed seraph we 're taking it back to the mobile lab to run diagnostics on it . Let me know what you find out . Uh , Frank , uh , listen . Joanne is suggesting that we do a full abort now . The cycle isn 't complete . All the work you 've done will be wasted . I can 't promise continual funding with a mess like this . What am I gonna tell Joanne ? We have confirmed casualties . Don 't tell her anything . You don 't work for her , you work for me . There 's too much at risk to take those things down now . [ Frank hangs up ] [ thunder ] I have to go . Oh . Eric ! [ thunder ] Oh , my God ! [ ominous music ] [ blasting wind ] Is that a tornado ? I 'm filming it . You 're gonna do what ? I 'm gonna shoot it . Hold on ! ( Nora ) Ah ! [ honks horn ] ( Charlie ) Nice little operation you got here . ( Joanne ) It 's a mobile unit . Ever seen one ? Sir ? ( Damon ) Here . Phil ! I got it . ( Gary ) Can you check this ? ( Joanne ) Gary- - Yeah . I know who this is . Hi . Hello . I have work to do . What 's eating him ? He 's busy right now . Not everyone 's a fan . Ash ! You okay ? Yeah . I think so . What does that mean ? Anything broken ? No , I said I 'm okay . You ? No , I 'm fine . I think . Why is it freezing ? I don 't know . What happened to the other car ? I don 't know . It must 've got sucked away or something . [ busy tone ] I can 't get any service . Great . The truck is stuck . What are we gonna do now ? I guess we try and walk up to the TV station . The truck 's not gonna get us anywhere . Okay ? A hell of a day , huh ? ( Ash ) Oh , yeah . Ah , shoot ! My camera . ( Ash ) What are you doing ? Hey , do you remember the last time a confirmed twister hit this area ? [ laughs ] Ten minutes ago ? No , before that . No . How 's " never " ? [ thunder ] ( Joanne ) Do we have workups on the storms ? ( Gary ) Right here , guys . ( Joanne ) Have we mapped them yet ? ( Gary ) Everything 's right there , Jo . No , she means if you started to profile it . Excuse me ? She 's looking for a pattern here . Okay , can someone please tell the fiction writer not to tell me how to do my job ? First storm hit here and then there were two more . ( Phil ) Area 's unstable , storms pop up everywhere . There 's a mandatory evacuation of five counties , including this one . ( Gary ) It looks like it 's growing but I can 't make out a pattern yet . Other than the fact that there is no pattern . He just said that . Are you guys twins ? Relax , guys . We 're all trying to figure this out . ( Gary ) They 're completely unpredictable I 'm only getting signals after they 're formed when it 's too late . And therein lies a pattern . Is he writing riddles now ? ( Damon ) What is your point ? In my latest book , my little hero solved the CO2 emissions problem but he didn 't solve global warming . CO2 levels continued to rise . Pockets of long buried CO2 melted out of glaciers and receding ice caps . The consequences had consequences . My little hero was so buried in the human equation , he missed the bigger picture . A systemic reaction . We 're still missing the point . We 're not looking in the right place . ( Damon ) It took a long way to get there . I 'm a fiction writer . I do that . ( Charlie ) The seraphs are the match , the storms are the fire we should figure out where the fuel is coming from . I bet you already have an idea . There 's a very loud sonic boom during the storm . You heard thunder . Not thunder . It was something else , these seraphs make the clouds and seed them with silver iodide ? How exactly are they doing this ? ( Jo ) These tiny wind turbines supply power to their propulsion systems there 's no limit to how long they can stay airborne . Once up , each one has a moisture evaporator designed to condense liquid nitrogen out of the upper atmosphere . I thought these were in the Troposphere . They are . Right at the ceiling just below the Tropopause . ( Gary ) It 's useless . Chips are fried . We 're not getting anything off it . What were your temp readings during your control storms ? Normal . The storms don 't affect the temps . They don 't ? There was a massive change of temp when the storm hit Harrisford . I pulled that thing out of near freezing water . What are you getting at ? Marker ? Pen ? ( Joanne ) Behind you . ( Charlie ) Okay . Your seraphs are here taking moisture in the atmosphere and processing it into liquid nitrogen , right , making this area here extremely dry at first . Even if the clouds form here this area is nearly devoid of moisture , right ? Am I wrong ? No , you 're right . There 's a sub atomic reaction happening it 's drawing moisture from the upper atmosphere the effect of this process is creating vertical weather . [ scoffs ] Come on , you know it doesn 't work like that . ( Charlie ) No , it hasn 't . It is now . The boom I heard has got to be the pauses that separate the layers being shredded apart , that would account for the severe drop in temperature and unpredictability of these storms . ( Damon ) We 've been on this project for three years . ( Charlie ) But you can 't explain why this is happening . Huh ? The reason you can 't track these storms is because they 're not happening here . They 're starting here and forcing their way down . I 've had enough of this . What ? Something I said ? Damon . We have a real problem and I 'm not gonna listen to this joker concoct his next book idea . Let 's just get the seraphs down , collect the data and we 'll know for sure . ( Jo ) What ? You did get the order , right ? Frank is taking them down . No . The seraphs aren 't coming . And you 're just telling me this now ? ( Damon ) Calm down , it 's not our call . He wants them to complete their cycle or else he 'll kill the project . Over my dead body . Jo ! ( Assistant ) Sir , I have Joanne Dyson on the line for you . Sir ? ( Frank ) Take a message . ( Eric ) You 're telling me , you don 't see that ? ( Eric ) You 're telling me you don 't see that ? See what ? I have no idea of what you 're talking about . It 's like a circle it kind of fades and then darkens . Oh , yeah , look at that cloud . It 's like a circus cloud . Oh , oh , and that one looks like a chihuahua riding a tricycle . I 'm serious . No , I think the accident damaged your brain . Are you still cold ? No . Not anymore . You ? No . Seems to have warmed up a bit , huh ? And that 's not weird to you ? I didn 't think much about it . Before I was cold and now I 'm not . Yeah , it was near freezing earlier . Normally , one would have to be in the deserts of Mongolia to experience a weather change that drastic and this one happened in the course of an hour . Less ? Eric , it 's getting cold again . We need to find shelter . I 'm seriously scared . It 's okay . We 're gonna be fine . I can 't believe you didn 't tell me this earlier . Okay , Jo , just breathe , alright ? We 're being a bit crazy now . It 's still my project , Damon ! Uh , well , I don 't think Frank sees it that way . Why ? What did he say ? Uh- - [ computer sound ] He said that he finances , so he owns it . You know . He- - Well- - He can 't be that dumb ! I sense we have a disparity in the chain of command around here . This guy 's powers of perception are outstanding . I also sense that you don 't like me . You stole my idea . I what ? You stole his idea . ( Gary ) Your book , your best seller , that was my idea and you stole it . What on God 's earth are you talking about ? ( Phil ) Gary was working on a wonderful book on the rising CO2 levels . So ? So , well , ( both ) you stole it ! You penned it off as your own . I 'm completely lost here , fellas . ( Jo ) Gary , are we still linked with the seraphs ? Phil ? Uh , well , uh , I believe so . How about control ? Yeah . Why ? ( Jo ) Good . Take them down . Wait . You 're playing a dangerous game . Take them down ! ( both ) We can 't ! Why ? The kill command sit with Frank in the Department Head , we don 't have that power . That 's garbage . If we can 't down them we can change what they 're doing , right ? ( Damon ) Once you go down this path , there 's no coming back . But we could reverse the process . What ? Reverse the ionization , they won 't grab moisture , they 'll redistribute instead of process . We 've never done it . We haven 't had to . Will that work ? I don 't know . Maybe . It would work on one of my books . ( Damon ) There 's the zero gravity thinking we needed . Or maybe it 's just " zero thinking . " Or maybe it 's Gary 's next best seller . ( Jo ) Can that be done ? It would 've been if he hadn 't stolen it ! No , Gary ! Can we reverse the ionization process ? Oh , uh , theoretically , I 'll try . ( Gary ) I 'll have to update my resume after I do . [ alarm signal ] [ ominous music ] Whoa , that 's not good . What ? We 've got another cell . A bad one . ( Joanne ) Where ? ( Gary ) Here , guys , the temp just crashed in the test area . ( Jo ) Get the signal down . ( Jo ) Then we can change the seraphs ' activity . I don 't know . I said I 've never done this . ( Jo ) Look , hurry . [ whistles ] We got a twister ! [ wind howls ] Oh , man , that 's coming straight for us . ( Jo ) It 's freezing everything in its path . Everybody , in the trucks , let 's go ! Guys , we need the data . ( Damon ) No , leave it ! Go to the truck and get out ! ( Damon ) Don 't ! Leave it ! Go ! ( Charlie ) Damon , move ! Come on ! Wait ! ( Charlie ) Get out ! ( Joanne ) Phil ! ( Phil ) Ah ! Come on , let 's go ! Did they make it ? I don 't know . I can 't see . [ brakes screech ] Come on . We 'll be safe there . Come on . Grab my hand . ( Charlie ) Hug me . Hold on tight . Hold on . ( Frank ) How long ago was this ? A half hour , sir . You 've tried making contact ? ( Bill ) Yes , but hard lines are out and cell towers must be down . I 'm having trouble getting through . We 've lost all visuals . Okay , here 's what I want you to do . I wanna fly over within the next hour if we can 't find out what 's going on from the ground maybe we can from the air . [ ominous music ] Good . Good ? Yes . I just don 't understand . What could be causing this ? Government testing . Come on . Governments want to control the weather . This looks more like out of control . China does it all the time . Russia accused China of stealing their rain . They almost went to war over it . Wait , China and Russia at war ? Now you 're starting to sound like Charlie Price . Hey , maybe we ought to burn this tape so the U.S. doesn 't end up going to war with Canada , huh ? It 's possible . No ! What 's possible is us failing this class . What if we change the assignment ? We get to the TV station , we cut the footage , we get together a piece , it always happens on the news , you 're covering one story , something else happens , boom . No ? Well , that 's the best idea you 've had all day . Are you being facetious ? No , it 's actually a really good idea . I know , right ? [ ominous music ] Sir , the plane will be over the target area in over two hours . What about FSF ? Have you been able to reestablish contact ? No . The storms are growing and they 've wreaked havoc on local communications . And the seraphs ? 18 hours and counting . That 's good . Where 'd they go ? You think they 're okay ? I don 't know . They got the signal off the seraphs in time ? I don 't think so . Me neither . I swear , if I ever get hold of Frank- - Ha ! Government and scientists don 't make good bed fellows . Don 't go there , Charlie . Do you think it 's easy ? I didn 't say that . You think this is bad ? You wanna take a snapshot of the Sudan right now ? Of Darfur ? Ethiopia ? Hundreds of thousands of people are dying . And we 're close . I understand the world 's problems . So what are you doing about it then ? What happened to you , Charlie ? You were one of the most promising scientists I ever knew . You could 've done great things and now you write fiction . Yeah , that 's right . I got tired of wasting time . Sitting around for funding for worthwhile solutions to real problems . Well , that 's a part of it . I also got sick of kowtowing the Government whims under the name of science . Thanks . I 'd rather try and do whatever good I can than waste my brain writing dime novel sci-fi waiting for my next movie deal . Who 's that helping ? Book stores ? Movie studios ? Me ? Good for you . Let 's try to stay on the same team here . You never were a team player , were you ? What happened to the hugging ? We were hugging . I felt the warmth . I 'm just trying to stay alive . [ honking ] ( Damon ) Hey . Are you alright ? ( Damon ) Yeah . How about you two ? Where 's Phil ? Get in . Get in . [ busy tone ] Anything ? No . ( Jo ) So how are we gonna fix this ? ( Charlie ) Gary ? ( Gary ) We only need a broadband connection . You guys see what I see ? I 'm not hungry . ( Damon ) No , Gary . He means the WiFi . Oh , uh , yeah , it 's probably worth a shot . ( Damon ) Hello ? Hello ! There 's nobody here . They 're in the storm cellar with Auntie Em . Enough with that . ( Jo ) Remember the mandatory evacuation ? Sorry , bad habit , I think . I didn 't realize you were thinking at all . What are you doing ? ( Gary ) Well , hospitality 's a little slow here , Jo , can you get that table , Damon ? Phones are still out . [ sighs ] If phones are out , how are we getting online ? WiFi runs to the cable modems , they 're underground . ( Gary ) Will someone try the lights ? Power 's out . For Pete 's sake ! It 's a motel , there 's gotta be a generator here somewhere . ( Gary ) Bottom line , no power , no modem . No modem , no connection . Let 's let the cyber geeks get online , we 'll go find the generator . Or maybe the hot tub . Got the disks ? Yeah . Come on . [ door opens ] [ suspense music ] ( Jo ) I 'm sure there are some keys back- - [ smashes door ] Or you can do that . A generator . You can 't write it better than this . [ Damon mumbles ] " Cyber geeks . " He called us cyber geeks ? Or maybe you can . What do you mean ? We 're out of gas . We have gas in the SUV . We can siphon some out . Yes we do . ( Eric ) Where 's everybody ? ( Ash ) They 're evacuated and with their families . News ? News doesn 't sleep . They don 't close . This is not New York . This is small town USA . Don 't knock small towns . Your first jobs are gonna be in places like this . I wonder if they scrapped the interview with Price altogether . Probably . [ sighs ] Alright , where to now ? Where to ? I 'd cut this footage and write this story . They 're not going to . So let 's find a way back to the university . We 're breaking a story . Time 's of the essence here . I get it but this place is closed . Yeah , but how closed ? You 're not talking about breaking in , are you ? It 's not breaking in . We were invited . Eric , it 's closed . There 's no sign . I 'd say the doors are mistakenly locked . Breaking and entering will not look good on our resumes . You kidding ? It 's Reporter 101 ! Breaking in and not getting caught is our job . That 's how it 's done in this field . Look at this . Huh ? If you want something the universe conspires with you . I wanted a pony as a kid but I never got it . You help me break this story ? I 'll get you two ponies . [ rattling sound ] And the Lord said . Let there be light . I sure hope this works . It 's got to . ( Gary ) Okay , I have the up link . It 's weak but it 's there . ( Damon ) Will the signal get through ? It should . ( Jo ) Gary , pull up the Doppler for me . [ ominous drone ] ( Gary ) Oh ! Oh , great . It 's getting awfully close to Portland . How much longer ? Uh , I don 't think they 're responding . [ ominous drone ] What are you doing ? It 's my attempt to email a punch in the face . How did that feel ? I 'll feel better when this is over . This is Frank , Where 's that plane ? I need some kind of visual . We 're flying blind here ! [ thunder ] It 's like we 're shut out . Frank . Keep trying . ( Jo ) We 're losing power . We can 't be . The generator 's full . ( Gary ) Signal 's fluctuating . We need more power ! I 'll check the genny . Wait ! I have a link . ( Gary ) It 's weak but it 's there . What about the seraphs ? ( Gary ) They 're holding their pattern . They 're not responding . ( Joanne ) We have to override them , keep trying . ( Pilot ) Something 's wrong with the pressure . ( Pilot ) We lost an engine . ( Pilot ) We 're going down . ( Pilot ) Mayday ! Mayday ! ( Male voice over phone ) We lost contact with the recon plane . [ shouts ] Where 's our eye in the sky ? Like I said , can 't write it any better than this . The tank 's cracked . Even I can 't fix it . We 're running out of time . The seraphs weren 't responding . Damon , are you saying Frank locked us out ? That 's where my money is . But the connection was weak , the signal could have been jumbled in the transmission maybe coming from another source and the seraphs just ignored it . So they 're artificially intelligent ? No , I 'm saying I need a solid signal I need some satellite up link that isn 't land based . What if Frank did lock us out ? Then it 's useless . No . Of course it 's not ! ( Gary ) Even if he did , I can hack it . He can 't keep me out . [ chuckles ] We can 't even get a phone line to work . We 're far away , where will we get a satellite feed ? [ phone signal ] Thank you , Nora . Who ? How about a TV station ? Yeah , that would work . Where ? I 'll show you . I 'm supposed to be there in an hour . ( Eric ) Oh , this is terrific stuff . Oh , this footage is priceless ! How 's the piece coming ? Here . How 's this sound ? " What was supposed to be a day following the controversial author " Charlie Price , quickly turned into a harrowed " real life struggle for survival " as the very disasters that his latest novel fictionalizes materialized in a small town with fatal consequences . " That 's not bad . Yeah ? It needs some finesse . Like what ? " Materializes " and " fictionalizes " are right next to each other . Yeah , it 's kind of a mouthful . " Fatal consequence " sounds like a sort of soup . A what ? You know what I mean . Eric , we 'd better not get in trouble for this . Relax , we 're done already . No one 's going to jail for editing . Worst thing they 'll do is charge us a rental fee . Oh , my Gosh . ( Damon ) Look at that . ( Charlie ) It must have been right in it 's path . Hello ! Can anybody hear me ? ( Charlie ) Can anybody hear me ? ( Charlie ) Watch yourselves , guys . Hello ! Can anyone hear me ? Nora . Nora ! Nora ! Joanne . Joanne ! [ sobs ] How did this get so out of control ? [ sobs ] We 're supposed to be saving lives . No one wanted this . How could we know this would possibly happen ? Because it 's our job to know ! I mean , how could we be so stupid ? And you let Frank take us over . You handed him this ! You let him hijack my research ! Well , no one else would fund it . And that 's the price we paid . Well , take a good look because this is our handy work . We 're murderers ! Where 's Frank ? Probably in his office reading sports pages . ( Damon ) Joanne ! Don 't touch me ! I 'm sorry , Charlie . I don 't know what to say . You don 't have to say anything . She shouldn 't have been out here . This is all my fault . Don 't do that . Why not ? It 's true . I should have been with her at the hospital instead of hanging around here pretending I 'm still in the game . You can 't control these things . What ? The weather ? I 'm sorry , Jo . That was wrong . No , you were right . When you start these things you never expect something like this to happen . [ sniffs ] But I knew who I was getting into bed with . And I thought I could handle the politics and the bureaucracy but I guess I 'm not strong enough . Damon may act like he can but , ( Jo ) deep down I don 't think he can stomach it either . And Gary 's- - ( Jo ) Gary 's just a boy genius in a big world . [ distant rumble ] [ ominous music ] No . Here we go again . Gary ! Damon ! Get in the car now ! Hurry ! Come on , let 's go ! ( Charlie ) Come on ! The twister 's coming ! Let 's go ! Sir , we 're not sure yet what happened to the plane , Intel is reporting vertical weather . Yes , sir , vertical weather . We 're not sure but it 's definitely not the seraphs . Yes , sir . How long before the seraphs complete ? 39 hours . I think we have all the proof we need . Time to pull the plug . Uh , sir , there 's a problem with that . What 's that ? They aren 't responding to any commands . I don 't care . Shoot them out of the sky . I don 't need these storms hitting a populated area . These things are all over the place . Whoa . Oh , my- - My God ! [ whispers ] We 're not sure where these storms are coming from ( Eric ) Okay , look at me for a minute . Alright . Okay . Feel pretty good about it ? Yup ! Yeah , I think so . Let 's do it . Okay . [ brakes screech ] ( Eric ) Uh-oh . ( Eric ) Oh , crap . We got company . Hide ! ( Ash ) Hide ? I thought you said no one goes to jail for this ! Maybe . It 's just the breaking and entering part I 'm a little iffy on . I 'm not hiding . Look at the truck it says FSF , that 's Federal Special Forces . ( Damon ) It looks closed . The news is never closed . [ knocks ] Hello ? Anybody in there ? [ knocking ] Would you hide ? Hey ! Special Forces ? Really . Look at the truck . ( Jo ) I don 't think anyone 's here . See ? Where 's the station manager ? Uh , not here . Who 's in charge ? So who are you ? Eric . Hey , you 're Charlie Price ! Ash , it 's Charlie Price . ( Gary ) Yeah , yeah , it 's Charlie Price . ( Jo ) Hi . Wait a minute . Who are you again ? ( Ash ) We 're from the university . We 're supposed to be doing an interview with him but there 's some crazy weather going on outside , we were stranded- - Did you guys see what 's going on ? So neither of you two work here ? Yeah , they co host the news . Try the phones . They 're dead . Sorry . We already tried . Satellite feed 's up and running . Working on it . ( Damon ) Let 's track the storms on the Doppler . ( Charlie ) What are you doing here ? We were late to your book signing so we tried to get you here . We got this crazy footage . Like something outta your books . You taped it ? Yeah , we were going to put a piece together . Where would that tape be ? Right there . ( Damon ) Thanks . That 's my tape . Not any more . ( Ash ) You can 't do that ! Who are you ? ( Charlie ) She 's right . Reestablished contact . Give him back that tape . So order them down . I said we had contact , not that we were in control , we 're still locked out . ( Charlie ) How long do we have ? I 'd say only a few hours . A few hours before what ? Nothing . You testing some kind of crazy weather program ? Can you get those things down ? Back off . I 'm trying . We don 't have time . What 's on the tape ? I 'm right . What 's on your mind ? Can we get Frank ? We must recover control . How do you plan to do that ? Don 't know . I 'm writing this as we go . ( Frank ) Thank God you 're alive , we 've been trying to reestablished contact . We 're not all alive . People are dead . Phil is dead . ( Damon ) If our calculations are correct in about two hours massive storms are gonna hit Portland and Seattle and a lot more can die . Yes , we know . You know ? When we lost contact we tried to abort but we couldn 't . So what are you doing about it , Frank ? Relax , Jo . We have ordnance on the way to take the down now , I understand that you 've been through hell and back but we have no choice but to terminate the project in its entirety . I 'm sorry , Jo , Damon . I know how hard you 've worked , we 'll talk about this when it 's over . Damn him . It 's all over now . He 's hiding something . This is Frank . Project Rain Dance is a success . We 're terminating the storm sequence . [ rings ] Yeah ? Yeah , it 's done . [ shreds ] They 're down . Seraphs are gone . ( Eric ) What 's a seraph ? You okay ? That 's a stupid question . I was close , Charlie . I know . But I feel like I 'm back at square one . So much time wasted . It wasn 't wasted . You made great strides . You advanced the field . They 're gonna do great things , Joanne . But I should 've know better , right ? Not necessarily . As bad as this is , no matter what you think of me , the reality is progress doesn 't fund itself . No , it doesn 't , does it ? Question is , is this progress ? Whoa , what do you mean ? Frank didn 't lock you out as a precaution or as a safety measure he wanted to see how powerful these storms would get . They used you . They hijacked your research and they used both of you . [ alarm ] What ? It 's not breaking up . ( Joanne ) What do you mean ? ( Gary ) It 's actually getting worse . ( Gary ) It 's headed straight for Portland . ( Joanne ) How can it be getting worse ? The match is gone but the fire is still lit . The reaction 's perpetuating itself . ( Damon ) That 's outrageous . The seraphs are down . ( Charlie ) And if it doesn 't ? ( Jo ) What are you talking about ? The eye of Jupiter . ( Gary ) Brace yourself . He 's cracking another can of zero gravity . I don 't care what you think . This storm won 't dissipate . ( Charlie ) The eye of Jupiter 's lasted 300 years , it draws it 's power source much like the ones you 've created , if I 'm wrong , this storm dies out . if I 'm right , we could 've stopped something that 's gaining the momentum to kill thousands , maybe millions of people . But we took down the seraphs . ( Gary ) I hate to add to the sense of panic here , but these storms are rapidly gaining in size . What do you mean they 're not stopping ? The seraphs are down , right ? Somehow the storms are still gaining momentum . This isn 't over . It 's Frank again . ( Frank ) The cells have gotten worse . How is this possible ? ( Jo ) We 're trying to figure that out . I 'm offering help . I just need to know what that is . Would 've been nice a few hours ago . Hey , uh , Frank , Eric here . ( Eric ) In the critically acclaimed book lonos-fear , these mercenaries take over H.A.R.T. and they shoot holes in ozones . Cool . ( Eric ) Maybe you could drown these storms like that ? Wow , Eric , that 's real sweet , I 'm sure Mr. Price thanks you but it would be best if you didn 't speak . Actually , the kid 's right . Who the heck is talking ? They picked up a few people along the way . It 's Charlie Price . The author ? ( Charlie ) No , the tin man . Theoretically , that 's what we should do , heat up the upper atmosphere expand the upper air masses to a point where we could cut off the power source completely . This dude is crazy . Is that possible , Joanne ? Theoretically . ( Eric ) Yeah , the H.A.R.T facility is real . Hey , it 's really far away . ( Joanne ) It 's in Alaska . The university has a high altitude array . ( Eric ) It 's a smaller facility but it 's similar to H.A.R.T. I just need to know if something like that would work . Well , would it ? ( Charlie ) H.A.R.T could open up the ozone but we need a heating element like reflective satellites to concentrate the sun 's energy where we need it . ( Frank ) It would take me weeks to free up those satellites . You don 't want to do it because you don 't want your fingerprints all over it . I 'm offering all the help I can give ! But you want it , you take it now . Or what ? I can get this done a lot sooner . What do you think you have me around for ? Frank , I need access code for the satellites . We 'd only borrow them for a bit . Do you know where this facility is ? 30 miles from here , just outside Beaverton . I 'll get you those access codes but I need assurances . Well you 're not getting any . We 're not doing a damn thing until you give Joanne back her program . What ? ( Charlie ) We all know you hijacked the research . ( Charlie ) You locked us out , we could 've stop this . We have proof . How long before the full brunt of those storms reaches the major cities ? Uh , about an hour . He 's right . It 's what we 're looking at . What are my assurances ? None . But you don 't have a choice , do you ? If you did , you would have taken it already . ( Frank ) Alright , I 'll give you what you want . Just stop those things . [ throws chair ] [ suspense music ] Well , we 've got some storms to stop . When this is over , I want Frank 's head . I 'll help you but we have bigger problems right now . Uh , FYI , hello ? ( Gary ) You 're heading for the heart of the storms . I love a challenge . You love suicide runs ? That 's what you 're dealing with . Here , kid . You know how to work the TV equipment ? ( Jo ) Send out a storm warning . Get the footage out , contact every station . Tell people to stay inside . Take shelter . ( Charlie ) Let 's set the sky on fire ! ( Charlie ) Let 's set the sky on fire ! [ suspense music ] [ alarm ] ( Eric ) Let 's go . ( Ash ) This is KJRX . We 've been hit by a massive storm cell . Several twisters tore through town raising buildings leaving many dead . It looks to be headed your way . You need to issue warnings . Come on , Frank . Give me those codes . Here we go . Did I ever tell you you 're a beautiful woman ? What ? Now 's a good time for a confession . Come on , Frank ! Give me the codes . Yes ! Give me that print out . Hey , are these the access codes ? Yup . Can I make a copy of these ? ( Gary ) Nope . Come on . Come on . Damn it ! They 're all around us . What do we do ? We gotta stop . ( Charlie ) Better buckle up . We 're going through it . We can 't do that ! We need to shoot through at the right angle . It 'll shoot us through like a slingshot . Are you crazy ? Are you just figuring that out ? That 's not gonna work . For my book I researched some physics . It 's called the moment of inertia . I just need the right speed . Hang on ! [ accelerates ] [ alarm ] Oh , no . ( Ash ) What 's going on ? They 're not gonna make it . ( Charlie ) We 're gonna make it ! ( Damon ) Oh , my God , we 're gonna die . Beautiful . Let 's play . Move ! Get the inside , now ! [ wind howls ] You gotta be kidding me ! Come on . Hurry up . Take cover ! Ugh ! Damon ! No ! Damon ! Ah ! Ugh ! Joanne ! Damon ! ( Charlie ) There 's nothing we can do . AII we can do is stop this from happening . Are you all okay ? Unfortunately , not all of us . Is this facility operational ? Yes . Alright . We don 't have much time . I knew you were coming . I 'm just not sure what you need . These are cyclonic storms drawing their power from the upper atmosphere . We need to punch a hole in the ozone to use our satellites to reach the Mesosphere so we can extinguish these storms and save millions of lives . ( Charlie ) Are you getting the picture ? Control room is this way . ( Eric ) What 's wrong ? I don 't think these are the right codes . How can they not be ? Well if I knew that ! Try your cases . My what ? It could be case sensitive . It happens to me all the time . Why don 't you just go back to your little corner there- - Take a hike ! Wow . I 'm in . ( Charlie ) How long to power up the array ? Not long . What 's your plan ? Open a wedge up in the ozone . ( Lady ) Okay . Powering up . I hope Gary got the codes . ( Charlie ) You can 't write it- - Please don 't say that stupid line ! Nothing good happens when you say that . ( Ash ) You have to hurry , we 're getting reports of massive storms over the cities . ( Gary ) And one of them 's over H.A.R.T. Well , no one 's gonna be waiting on me . You did it ? Yeah . Yeah ? Dude . Good stuff . Gary did it . We 've 3 minutes until the satellites are in place . ( Lady ) We 'll be at full power by then . Let 's just hope the storm doesn 't freeze the array . They 're in control of the satellites . It 's all on them now . The storms ? Critical mass . Lord help us . [ alarms ] What is that ? ( Lady ) We just went to generator power . Not another generator . Is it enough to power the array ? ( Lady ) It should be . ( Security ) No ! [ wind howls ] ( Charlie ) We 're out of time ! ( Lady ) Power 's coming back , we 're at 75 percent . ( Lady ) We 're at 85 percent ! Come on , guys , fire it now ! Come on ! ( Lady ) 95 percent ! Almost there ! It 's now or never . Fire it ! [ suspense music ] [ alarm ] ( Gary ) Guys , something 's happening . ( Ash ) What 's going on ? The facility wasn 't built for this ! Is it working ? The beam is getting cold . Yes ! ( Jo ) They fired the satellite but is it working ? Is it working ? Uh , I don 't know . They 're dying out . Oh , they hit it . ( Eric ) Yes ! ( Gary ) Yes , they did it . ( Ash ) Yes ! I can 't believe it . Huh ? Yes ! They did it ! ( Eric ) Yes ! Sir , I think it worked . I think they did it . [ both laugh ] ( Charlie ) Here they are . So it was you . I told you it was Charlie . So ? What 's with all the hush rush stuff ? Why are we meeting so secretively ? Your assignment was A Day in the Life of Charlie Price . Yeah , it was . What do you say we do something better ? Yeah . What 's on your mind ? You ready for this ? I think so . As ready as I 'm ever gonna be . After this I 'll have to go back to being your research assistant . I should be so lucky . Set up the camera . Alright . [ thunder ] It 's supposed to rain today ? [ Joanne laughs ] No , Charlie . You can 't write it any better than this . Hey , I didn 't say it . Sir , we have a problem . Why do I care about this ? Because copies were sent to the Senate investigation committee . [ phone rings ] What ? ( Assistant ) Sir , there are a couple of federal agents here to see you .

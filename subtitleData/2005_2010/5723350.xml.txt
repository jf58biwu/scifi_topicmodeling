 JACK : Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race . The 2 1 st century is when everything changes . And Torchwood is ready . ( DISTANT BANGING ) Mike , did you hear that ? Someone 's in the living room . - Are you going to go in there ? - Are you ? - Emergency . Which service ? - Police . MIKE : Who 's there ? My name 's Beth Halloran , I 'm at 114 Brodsky Gardens . I think there 's a burglar in the flat . Come quickly . - Come on , then ! - Get back in there ! - Mike ! - MAN : Sit down there . There 's two of them . My husband 's been injured . Send an ambulance ! - Get the TV stuff unhooked . - Wait . Just take whatever you want . - Keep her quiet . - Wait , wait . Do you hear that ? OPERATOR : Beth , are there any other exits you can take ? Beth , can you hear me ? BURGLAR : What 's happening ? BURGLAR 2 : Get away ! ( BETH SCREAMING ) BURGLAR : No , please ! Don 't , don 't , please stop . - I 'm sorry ! - BURGLAR 2 : What 's going on ! I 'm sorry . No ! Get away ! No ! - JACK : Tosh , what happened here ? - Two IC1 males . One fatality , one seriously wounded after a fall from a fifth floor window onto a police vehicle . Bloody hell . Here you are , has he been stabilised ? Gwen , Owen , go with him to the hospital . See if he says anything . Interview the husband and wife while you 're there . Tosh , with me . Bit weird this one . Might be one of yours . Nobody saw anything , heard anything , blah , blah , blah , the usual . Don 't know why I bother asking any more . Thanks so much . We 'll take it from here . If you could just wait outside . In my opinion , the husband did it . He was looking for trouble , expecting to be burgled . - Really ? - Yeah , look . No other reason I can think of for keeping sports equipment in the bedroom . Oh , you should come round to my house for a game of hockey sometime . - Making friends ? - Not really . What have you got ? Well , no glass inside , so it was definitely broken out . Police say the stab wounds were caused by some sort of long , narrow blade , which that isn 't . No other weapons in the room could have done this , so how the hell did they manage it ? Husband was unconscious and the wife probably weighs less than I do . I can 't see either of them doing this . When you fear for your life , you 'd be surprised what you can do . BETH : I didn 't see anything . We all heard this weird noise , then the next thing I know , I 'm in the corner and he 's just sitting there , dead . - The other one was just gone . - And then what ? Nothing . I just stayed there till the police arrived . I couldn 't move . - I should have checked on Mike . - Don 't be silly . You did the right thing . I 'm fine . Be quiet you . The doctor said you should rest . I don 't think the doctor meant my mouth . Actually , he did . He was very specific . He said no talking for a whole week . Lies , lies , why so many lies ? Okay . Thanks for your time . We 'll let you get some rest now . Not a trace of blood on their hands , either of them . - Then who did it ? - She did , obviously . - Why obviously ? - Well , look at her . - I 'm sorry . - Hey , it 's okay . Yeah . I can see what you 're saying . She 's absolutely terrifying . It 's always the one you least suspect . They 're all in a room together , the hubby 's out cold and somehow she survives while two burglars get mangled ? - She did it . She must have . - How ? - I haven 't worked that bit out yet ... - Ah , I see , I see . All right then , Jessica Fletcher , whodunnit ? The husband . His wife 's in danger . He keeps a cricket bat under the bed . - You fill in the blanks from there . - Right , okay . So he kills one man , wearing gloves , and then he swallows the murder weapon and the gloves and then he knocks himself out ? - Something like that , yeah . - Right . To be continued . - Yeah ? - JACK : It 's me . Anything ? No , nothing . They 're completely clear . Well , one of them did it . We just need to figure out how . Stay with the burglar all night if you have to . Keep an eye on those two . - Okay , fair enough . - Tosh . That was Jack . He says that you should stay with the burglar and find out if he knows anything , all night if you have to . I know , and keep an eye on the other two . Brilliant , brilliant . Oh , will you get me a coffee before you go ? Yeah , yeah , of course . What are teammates for ? You haven 't got a pound for the machine , have you ? Hospitals . They have to fall apart before anyone fixes them . - Pound . Coffee . - Thank you . ( MONITOR BEEPING ) ( CLATTERING ) Oh , shh . Okay . You 're safe now , all right ? You 're safe . Just tell me who did this to you . The woman in the flat . Keep her away from me . NURSE : Page the doctor . Can you move , please ? Quickly , we need to get him lying down . - Tell me everything . - Where am I ? - Where 's my husband ? - He 's safe . What do you mean , safe ? What 've you done with him ? Nothing yet . Tell me what happened in the flat , Beth . It had to be you or Mike , so how did you do it ? You can 't treat people like this . I 've been burgled , attacked . I want a lawyer . I want a phone call . - If you 're charging me with something ... - We 're not charging you with anything . We don 't have to . And there 'll be no lawyer , no phone calls . Just us and this room for as long as it takes . Now , tell me what happened ! I told her . And the police . Please , I don 't know anything . Look at them . The second one just died in the hospital . " Keep her away from me . The woman in the flat . " Those were his dying words . Now why would he say something like that ? I don 't know , I swear . I never touched him . - Is it Mike ? Are you covering for him ? - No ! Jack . Beth , we know these men attacked you and your husband . Now , if you fought back , people will understand , it was self-defence . I promise . I promise I have no idea what happened to them . All I know is that it wasn 't me . " Just us and this room for as long as it takes ? " - Terrifying . - Really ? - Absolutely . Shivers down my spine . - You don 't look scared . Oh , it passed . - Tosh , anything on the body scan ? - Nothing out of the ordinary . - What about the light ? Power surge ? - Nothing from us . There was an electromagnetic build-up around her , but I can 't see how she caused it . Same thing happened at the hospital , Jack . - Can 't be a coincidence . - It 's her . I know it is . Okay , let 's do some tests . See who or what we 're dealing with . I 'm on it . What kind of tests ? Just little things to clear this all up . Blood samples ... Blood samples ? I haven 't done anything ! Look , I believe you , but this is our job . Something really strange happened at your flat and we 've got to make sure you had nothing to do with it . - But I didn 't . - Then you 've nothing to worry about . They 're doing these tests whether you like it or not , Beth . Don 't make this any harder on yourself . Come on . - This is where you work ? - Yep . Cosy , isn 't it ? Who are you people ? Don 't you have any windows ? It wouldn 't really be in-keeping with the whole secrecy thing , people looking in , would it ? We don 't sniff the sub-etheric resonator . Sorry . - It 's so big . This is crazy . - Yep . I suddenly feel very , very small . Come on , let 's just get these tests done , then you can get home , okay ? Come on , Owen . We 'll start with a few blood tests . Nothing to worry about , just a little needle . - What ? - Needle 's snapped . - Haven 't you got a nurse to do this ? - He 's a doctor . It 's okay . Okay , look , I 'm not going to do this if you can 't even ... What are you doing ? - Bear with me . - Hey , hey . When was the last time you were in hospital , Beth ? I don 't remember . I don 't think I ever have . Why , what 's wrong with me ? - Well , any operations ? Check-ups ? - No , nothing . When was the last time you felt ill ? You had a cold ? Anything ? I don 't think I ever have . I take a lot of vitamin C. Hmm , hell of a lot , I reckon . Okay , Beth , you make light bulbs blow , we can 't break your skin . What planet are you from ? Earth . Stop wasting our time . We know you 're an alien . There 's no such thing as aliens . Beth , Janet . Janet , Beth . BETH : what is it ? JACK : It 's an alien . But you know that because you are , too . No , it 's not . I 'm not . I work in an office ... Why do you give off electromagnetic waves ? - Why ? - I don 't know . Stop it . Why are you doing this ? I want Mike . I want to go home . ( MOANING ) Why is it doing that ? I don 't know . It 's never done it before . ( MOANING ) - This is real , isn 't it ? - Yeah . I don 't know about my skin or any of that other stuff . I just ... How can I prove it to you ? How can I prove to you that I 'm not an alien ? ( MOANING ) You said we weren 't allowed to use that again . It 's just a mind probe . You remember what happened last time we used it ? That was different and that species has extremely high blood pressure . Oh , right . Their heads must explode all the time . Jack , you can 't do this . What if you 're wrong ? If she is human , it 'll kill her . I 'm not wrong . - We have to find out what she is . - Take it easy , Jack . - Stop at the first sign of trouble . - Or the first sign of exploding . Gwen , bring her up . Okay . ( BUZZING LIKE BEING ELECTROCUTED ) Hey ! - Not too tight , is it ? - It 's fine . - Are you sure this is safe ? - Yep . Just try not to , you know , kill me or anything , okay ? You 'll probably get dehydrated during the probing . Thank you . ( CLEARS THROAT ) We 're all set . The probe drills down through your consciousness , so if there 's anything hidden , it 'll pop to the surface . - Will it hurt ? - Yeah . Your bedside manner 's rubbish . You should see his manners in bed . They 're atrocious . - Apparently , so I 've heard . - Oh , they are . I remember ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) - All right . We all ready ? - I suppose . Okay , we 'll do this slowly . Tosh will control the probe . Owen will make sure you 're not in any danger . And Ianto , he 'll have more water when you need it . And I 'll be right here . Okay ? - What about him ? What does he do ? - I 'll be watching . Are you ready , Beth ? Okay , Tosh . ( PROBE HUMMING ) ( YELLING ) I 'm human ... - Safe . - Who killed the burglars , Beth ? I don 't know ! I ... - Safe . - What planet are you from ? I 'm human ! Oh , God , it hurts . Please , please stop ! - Go deeper . - Are you sure ? Do it ! ( SCREAMING ) Vital signs are all over the place , but still safe . Getting electromagnetic build-up again . - Who killed those men ? - I don 't know . Make it stop ! - For God 's sake , come on ! - Go deeper . - Safe . - Deeper ! ( ALARM RINGING ) IANTO : Something 's happening to the lights . The electromagnetic pulse is going off the scale . - Don 't know how much more she can take . - GWEN : Jack , we 've got to stop this ! ( GASPS ) ( BEEPING ) Oh , my God . I wouldn 't get that close . Toshiko , what happened ? Hit a buried compartment . Locked away . She couldn 't have been aware of it . Who are you ? ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Where are you from ? ( REPEATS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE ) How do you like my boots ? ( REPEATS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE ) - Jack , what is it ? What is she saying ? - Name , rank , serial number . - That 's all she 's going to say . - How do you know ? 'Cause I know who she is and why she 's here . - Switch off the probe . - Off . You weren 't lying . That really hurt . Did you find anything ? She 's a sleeper agent . It all clicked when I saw the implant . A sleeper agent ? Who for ? No one knows very much . They don 't leave survivors . Official designation is Cell 114 . They infiltrate planets , adapting their bodies , gathering intelligence , sometimes for years , watching , - until they 're ready to take over . - Okay , that 's creepy . If we 're lucky , she 's the first . They send an advance guard to gather intel , give them false memories so they blend in . She has no idea she 's not human . Her real self must have taken over briefly , killed the burglars , self-preservation . Told you she did it . The point is , by the time they attack , they know every single thing about the planet . - Tosh . - The implant gathers information . Normal X-rays don 't show it . She 's projecting a false image . It 's got all this data stored inside it . This is a force-field generator . It creates an impervious layer above the skin , just a nanometre thick . That 's why you couldn 't get the needle inside her . Right , well ... God , look . They even know about us . They know more about this place than I do . Nobody knows more than I do . What if there 's more of them ? What are we going to do about this ? For a start , I think we should tell her . ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) JACK : Where are you from ? ( REPEATS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Can you turn it off , please ? - So I killed those men ? - Yes . And I 'm a mass-murdering alien ? - Yes . - My whole life . All my memories , they can 't be fake . I know I love Mike and he loves me . He does and you do . So what 's real ? You both are , you both fell in love . That happened . Do you feel human ? - Yes . - Yes , well , then you are . What makes us human ? Is it our minds or our bodies ? And what happens when the disguise comes off ? I want to have kids one day . Is " feeling human " enough for that ? Can you fix me ? Can you make me human ? No . Eventually you 'll activate . Your real memories will come back and Beth will disappear . What do you mean , activate ? Once you gather enough information , you 'll send it back home and start the invasion . There must be something you can do . All this technology and everything you do here . You can 't keep me locked up next to that thing . - Are you going to kill me ? - No . No , of course we 're not . - Have you killed other aliens ? - Only when we 've had to . When it was the last resort , kill or be killed . I wish this wasn 't happening . I 'd never know . I 'd just live a normal life . - Until the day of the attack . - I won 't do anything . I 'm not that person ! I 'm sorry , but you are . We can 't let her go . She 's too dangerous . We could freeze her . Use the alien cryogenics . Wake her up if we figure out how to stop her memories from coming back . - Freeze her ? For how long ? - As long as it takes . At least she 'd be alive . Her implant would still gather information . Can 't we deactivate it ? I can isolate the transceiver and fry it in an EM pulse . Right now , it 's not sending or receiving anything . I 've checked it five times on every frequency . Won 't that let them know we 're onto them ? No . If we freeze her , she 'll never activate and they 'll never know . - What about her husband ? - She 'd have to disappear completely . No goodbyes . We had a holiday booked . Nothing special , just a weekend away . - Am I ever going to see him again ? - I don 't know . ( BETH SCREAMING ) Those men . Oh , my God , those poor men ! What 's happening ? The real memory is coming back , destroying the fake human persona . The sooner we do this , the better for everyone . Beth . Beth , come on . Promise me something . If you can 't figure out how to keep me human , then don 't wake me up . Just turn the machine off . That 's not a promise I can keep . Okay , you then . I bet you can . - Just don 't let me hurt anyone . - You have my word . It 's funny , I 've always had this nagging feeling , like I didn 't fit in . Just so desperate to have a more exciting life . I 'm going to hit the transceiver with an EM pulse . You won 't feel anything . It won 't harm you . It 'll take out the force-field generator , too , I 'm afraid , - so I 'll have to fry them both . - Do it . - I don 't want to be invincible . - After that , I 'm going to sedate you . Then we 'll freeze you . It 'll be like ... Just like going to sleep . Only a bit colder . - Bye , Gwen . - Bye . ( ELECTRICAL BUZZING ) Done . " You want the whole bloody seat to yourself , be my guest . " In fact , " I said , " why don 't we just ask all the other passengers " just to get off and then you can have the whole carriage to yourself ? " Would you like that ? " - You didn 't . - I did . I was really loud , too . I couldn 't help it . I was just really annoyed . So then , so then , right , she gives me the dirtiest look , right , and she ... ( BEEPING ) David ? What is that ? What 's happened to your arm ? Hey ! Where are you going ? David , you 're scaring me . What are you doing ? What 's happening ? Come back here . David ! ( BEEPING ) ( BABY CRYING ) ( TYRES SCREECHING ) It 's done . I 'm sending her down to the vault . ( CLATTERING ) ( BEEPING ) ( SIREN WAILING ) JACK : Can somebody tell me what the hell is going on ? Oh , shit ! - What happened ? - Beth 's gone . - I thought she was frozen . - She was . All her vitals were at zero . Checking systems , command history . What did she do ? Is it a virus , a lockdown ? - No . She just turned off the lights . - What is it with her and light bulbs ? - She went through the tunnels . - Time to change the locks again . She knew everything about this place . It was all in her arm . The tunnels , layout , security codes ... She could have shut us down , blown us up , anything . - But she didn 't . - I swear , she was frozen . Tosh , you switched off the transceiver ? - Yes . - Are you sure ? Well , I was until you asked . - Unless it was another false image . - Hang on , hang on . Everything about her was a lie . All of her vital signs were a false image . She can fool the equipment . She can tell it what we 're expecting to see , so she gets scared and it projects an increased heart rate , we try and freeze it and it does the opposite . Simulating that much information would need a huge amount of energy . No wonder she had a big electromagnetic field . That 's why the lights blew every time she got upset . So what 's she doing ? Did we activate her ? She couldn 't be activated . If she was , we 'd all be dead . We took her off the network . She has some other agenda . Hey . How are you feeling ? What 's going on ? Nobody will tell me anything . - You all right ? - I 'm fine . I ... Listen , you know I love you , don 't you ? Of course I do . I love you , too . - Do you promise ? - Why ? I just had to be sure . - I have to go away . - What do you mean ? Where ? I can 't tell you , but it 's for your own good . Beth , what are you talking about ? No . I 'm sorry , I just ... I have to stay away from you . If I don 't , I 'm going to end up hurting you . Well , this is hurting me . Don 't go . Whatever happens , just know that I love you . And I always will . If you 've done something , I don 't care . Just don 't leave me . - We 'll get through this . - No , not this time . I have to put things straight and I can 't do that anywhere near you . - I love you too much for that . - Don 't let the police take you . I 'm not going to let you go . I don 't care what it is . I don 't care ... ( BEEPING ) - What was that ? - I don 't know . It sounded like ... Oh , my God ! Mike ! Help ! Help ! Somebody get a doctor . Help ! Somebody ! Beth ! It was just an accident . I just wanted to say goodbye . She 's got a weapon system built into her arm . - Clear . - It 's getting worse . She 's losing control . We need to contain her fast . - Come on , Beth . Let 's get you back . - No ! - Come on . - No , no , no . Pick her up . ( NURSES AND DOCTORS SHOUTING ) - So what else happened at school today ? - Alex 's got a girlfriend . - Have not ! - Have , too . - She 's called Jessica . - I 'm gonna kill you so much . - Patrick Grainger ? - Alex , don 't kill your sister . Not before tea anyway . Patrick ? Oh , my God . Stop it ! Get away from him ! Please , don 't hurt my children . No ! Please . ( BEEPING ) Oi ! Get back in that truck or I 'll shove it up your arse ! Oh , shit ! Tosh ? We got her . It 's all over . We 're on our way . What 's going on ? - You okay ? - Yeah . I think so , yeah . - What the hell was that ? - A petrol tanker . Looks like someone wanted to take out the M4 link road , for some ... No , it 's not the road . There 's an underground fuel pipeline . It 's a special supply for the military . They use it in emergencies . Not any more . Hold on . I 've got a report coming through . Patrick Grainger 's been murdered . - Who ? - Leader of the council , stabbed several times in the chest and once in the forehead . Sound familiar ? - Why would anyone want to kill him ? - He 's also the city coordinator . Takes charge of the city in case of major emergencies . - Has all the security protocols . - How do you know all that ? I know everything . And it says so on the bottom of the screen . They 're putting all the pieces in place . Gwen , take her . Tosh , Owen , it 's starting . It 's happening right now . ( HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING ) Tosh ? It 's not just her . She 's part of a cell and they 've activated . It 's happening . Tell me how to stop it ! - It can 't be ... - Think ! Beth , look at me . Look at me ! - How do we stop this ? - I don 't know . I 'm cut off from the cell . I don 't know what the mission is . - I 'm sorry . - What about your implant ? - How did you get out of Torchwood ? - The technology is part of me . I can switch it on . I can use the tools . Can you do that now ? Can you trace the other cell , Beth ? No . What if it goes wrong ? If you don 't , Beth , other people will die , not just Mike . - There 's only one left . I can track him . - Let 's go . Come on . Hang on . I 've got an idea . No , I can 't just hook something up . The entire telephone network is down . - What about a mobile connection ? - The entire telephone network is down . Mobiles , landlines , tin cans with bits of string . Everything . Absolutely everything . No phones . Phones all broken . Hello ? Anyone there ? No , because the phones aren 't working . - What 's that ? - CB radio . They knocked out the phones , but they can 't knock out the radio waves . Not yet anyway . What about we try ... There is no way of getting in touch with Jack . No way ! ( STATIC ON RADIO ) - Tosh , Owen , can you hear me ? - Jack ! - Thank God . What happened ? - There 's a cell . It 's active . Four including Beth , two are dead . We 're tracking the last guy now . If we can get to him before he does anything , we can stop this . What can I do ? He 's heading for an abandoned farm , just outside the city . I need to know what 's out there . Where the hell 's he going ? There 's nothing there ! Nothing on the surface . - He 's nearly there . We need to hurry . - Yeah . Hurrying , thank you . - What happens when it starts , Beth ? - How do you get in the heavy weapons ? I don 't know . I think we just have this arm stuff . So how do you manage to take over so quickly ? I don 't know . I didn 't even know how to use this thing until today . This is as far back as they could go . There used to be a coal mine in the cliff . The army sealed it off in the ' 40s . Doesn 't say why . Let me see if I can get into the military files . Come on , guys . That wasn 't even difficult . You disappoint me . It 's almost obscene what you do to security systems . - Oh , God . - JACK : What is it ? The mineshaft . The military are using it for storage . Nuclear warheads . 10 of them . Nobody 's supposed to know , not even us . - That 's how it starts . - No heavy weapons . Exactly . They don 't need any . They use our own against us . We left the key under the doormat . All you need is to walk in and take over . Please tell me you can stop this . Going as fast as we can . If we don 't , we won 't feel a thing . We 're all at the centre of the blast radius . - That 's comforting . - Come on , have a little faith ! With a dashing hero like me on the case , how can we fail ? He is dashing , you have to give him that . - And what if they can 't stop it ? - They 'll stop it . - Yeah , but if they can 't ? - Then it 's all over . Let 's all have sex . And I thought the end of the world couldn 't get any worse . SOLDIER : Halt ! Stop the vehicle . Get out of the vehicle now ! Lie face down on the ground ! On the ground , or we shoot ! Fire ! ( DOORS OPENING ) Have we thought this part of the plan through ? This isn 't going to be pretty . Brace yourselves . - How are we going to stop him , Jack ? - Like this . This wasn 't supposed to happen today . How do we stop it ? Gwen ? Gwen ! ( JACK GRUNTING ) It doesn 't matter . You can 't stop us . We know what your weakness is . We know who you are , Jack Harkness . We know all about you and Torchwood . We got a lot of information before you switched her off . - You 'll be factored into our plans . - Gwen ? Nearly there . I 've got it . He 's done . Don 't bother . Your transmitter 's dead . And so 's your force-field . - You 're lying . - Oh , yeah ? Factor that into your plans . Now , when are the others coming ? They 're already here . ( BEEPING ) I won 't let you take me . Run ! ( LAUGHING ) Whoo ! It 's done . TOSHIKO : I 'll do it , but I 'm not happy . JACK : Just do what you have to . We 're set with the cryogenics when you 're ready . Will it work this time ? Tosh has reconfigured the casket . It 'll work around the implant . No more false images . - If we 'd been one minute later ... - We weren 't . We stopped him . And what happens when you have to stop me ? - If the freezing doesn 't work ? - It won 't come to that . I can feel it coming . It 's pushing me out . What will you do when I lose my last bit of me ? - We will figure something out , Beth . - No , we won 't . I 'm too dangerous for that . We both know it . Do you have someone at home ? A fiancé . - Have you ever hurt them ? - More than once , yes . Remember how guilty you felt ? Imagine that times a billion , all the time , every second of the day . That 's how I feel now . And the worst part is , when I turn back , I won 't feel guilty any more . I 'll want to carry out my mission . I won 't even care about Mike . I 'll forget all about him . I don 't want to die as one of those things , Gwen . - I don 't want to forget about Mike ... - Then don 't . Let 's do this . Who knows what we 'll be able to do in a month ? A year ? Thanks for being so good to me . Remember me the way I am now . Remember Beth . Beth . Beth ? I won 't let you freeze me ! I 'll kill you all ! Let her go ! Let her go ! No ! Wait , wait , wait , wait , don 't shoot ! It 's a trick . She won 't hurt me ! She won 't hurt me . - Move away from her now ! - Everybody , calm down . - Beth ? - Beth . You don 't want to do this . Let Gwen go . I 'll kill her first , then all of you , then the rest of your miserable species . Beth , please . They will kill you . You have proved to be better than that . You helped us to stop the invasion . You can be human . Please , Beth . - Not human enough . - Beth . Goodbye , Gwen . Good luck . She wanted you to shoot her ! She used her last shred of humanity to do this . We couldn 't take that chance . She must have known that . JACK : She did . She just wanted to make it easier for us . Do you think we stopped it ? Maybe . Maybe we just put it off for a while , I don 't know . - We don 't know anything . - We know plenty . We know about the implant . We can disable their force-field . We know how they attack . We know that they can be killed . And while they think they have the element of surprise , we know they haven 't , but until that day , we just keep doing what we do . Oh , them be fightin ' words , they be , Gwen ! - So have you set a date ? - Oh , don 't get me started , please . My mam 's already been on the phone , saying , " What about the local church , Gwen ? It 's ever so lovely . " Go home . Keep doing what we do . Good night , Jack . GWEN : He 's a frozen soldier from 1918 . OWEN : We have to wake him up every 12 months . - Leave me alone ! - It 's me . - Toshiko . - Is it time again ? JACK : Two different times should never exist simultaneously . You shouldn 't be here ! JACK : Chunks of 1918 will start to appear at the hospital . Yeah , we 've got a few ghosts here . I think you 'd better come with us . JACK : He needs to be in the hospital , ready to step from one time to another . You 're the only one who can stop this . Why me ? OWEN : It 's not years in the future . It 's now .

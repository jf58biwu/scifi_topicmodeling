 Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race . The 21st century is when everything changes and Torchwood is ready . ♪ So who can you trust to transport your goods ? ♪ Harwood 's ♪ You won 't be sorry With a Harwood 's lorry ♪ Yeah , Ruth . Did you hear it ? I wrote the last bit . What sort of accident ? Yeah , I know it . Yeah , I 'll get over there now . Stay back , please . You 're going to have to move your car . I 'm Rhys Williams . I 'm manager of Harwood 's Haulage . You can check on the vehicle later . Bollocks to that , mate . I know the driver . Is he ... Didn 't make it . Sorry . Can you give me some details , sir ? It 's Leighton . Uh , Leighton Reynolds . - Next of kin ? - Yeah , he 's got a wife . Jen . - Just had a baby . - Do you know the address ? Yeah , erm , 54 Keppoch St , Roath . - I give him a lift to football . - Thank you , sir . Er , right . I 'm going to need to arrange to move the lorry . Not yet . There 's something suspicious in the back . It 's just meat . Leighton was taking it to the abattoir . Yeah , well , whatever . Torchwood want to look at it first . Oh , it stinks . No bones . Just dense flesh . It 's not like any flesh I 've ever seen . What is it ? Well , as there haven 't been any giant cow sightings , I suggest we take a sample back to the Hub . We 're gonna need to take the contents of the van . Confiscate it until we 've done further investigations . Did you find out where it came from ? No , but it 's a Harwood 's lorry , so they should know . Oh , erm , that 's Rhys ' firm . - Right , done . - Let 's go . Sorry , sir , you can 't come this way now . There is evidence of a vertebral column , but its genetic make-up isn 't compatible with any known animal . - Any idea what it is ? - I 'll have to scan it . But whoever 's farming this meat knows it 's dodgy . See this ? Official vet stamp . " Fit for Human Consumption . " It 's fake . - It 's good , but it 's fake . - Tosh , get onto the haulage firm . Find out where that meat is from and where it 's heading . Why does it have to be Rhys ' firm ? It 's a bit too close to home . Do you want to stand down ? No . I want to find out what 's going on . Thank you , Ianto . ♪ You won 't be sorry with a Harwood 's lorry ♪ - Catchy . - Do you think the haulage firm - might be in on it , too ? - Rhys ? No . He doesn 't know what goes in the vans . He just hires them out . - The driver must have seen it loaded . - That doesn 't implicate Rhys . - He 's the most honest man I know . - Have you got his direct line ? Harwood 's Haulage , how may I help you ? It 's the police . Hello . Yeah , speaking . Yes , I 'm aware of the accident . It 's a firm called Harris and Harris . They came to us about two months back . It 's a weekly contract . - Are they licensed ? - Yeah , of course they 're licensed . Could you give me their address ? - There 's no address down here . - There 's a pick-up point . They said it was hard to find . Hello , sorry . All I 've got is a service station on the A470 . - 15 miles from Cardiff . - Do you have their contact number ? No , there 's no contact number either . Can you tell me where your driver took the meat ? Yes , he was taking it to Caerwen Abattoir . It 's a processing plant . Just a general meat suppliers . What time did the driver leave base ? Signed out at 12 : 50 . Can I ask what 's this about ? I can 't release that information , sir . Thanks for your cooperation . Yeah , but I 'm the manager ... Brilliant . Leighton was their regular . Apart from that first booking , they just went through him . Yes , but now it looks like I 'm hiding something , Ruth . Got him . There he is coming back 40 minutes later . Let 's say it takes 20 minutes to load , we are talking a 10-mile radius . - Jack ? - Yeah ? The scan shows it 's definitely alien meat . Where the hell would they get it from ? If it 's going into the processing plant , that means it 's going into pies , burgers , pasties , everything . That means people have been eating it for months . Well , the DNA traces are stable . There are some signs of animal sedative , but no detectable diseases or residues . My guess is it 's good to eat . Would you eat it ? Pizza 's arrived . I presumed it would be a late one . - What did you get me ? - Your usual , Meat Feast . Lovely . I 've narrowed it down to three potential areas . Only one warehouse is unoccupied . - It 's just outside Merthyr . - Makes sense . Who knows what goes on there ? We 've got to shut the operation down , neutralize whoever 's doing this ... and identify the alien meat . Tosh , you can coordinate . I have to slip home and check on Rhys first . Good idea . Find out how much he knows . That 's not what I meant . Hiya . I got your message . Are you all right ? Bit of a tough day . Had an accident at work . One of our lorries crashed . - Anyone hurt ? - Leighton , one of my drivers , died . - Oh , no . - Only 24 . - Were you close ? - For God 's sake , Gwen , you met him . Small , dark hair , played five-a-side with me . Sorry , I can 't ... I can 't place him . Well . Then I hear that the police have taken the meat out the back of the van . You any idea why ? - How would I know ? - You work for them . I don 't deal in traffic accidents , so ... Well , they phoned the office and , erm , they asked a load of questions . Thing is , all I do is hire out the lorries , so I ... Then there 's nothing for you to worry about , is there ? Must be something dodgy going on , though . Well , if there was , you weren 't to know , were you ? - No , of course not . - No . I wish I didn 't have to go back to work now . - Hardly worth you coming home . - Yes , it was . To see you . I 'm sorry . I 'll see you later . Go and have a pint . Call Daf . Yeah . Yeah , maybe I will . Like I thought , he has no idea what 's going on . Would you care to accompany me to the slaughterhouse ? - Have you ever eaten alien meat ? - Yeah . - What was it like ? - He seemed to enjoy it . You 're rough . Ianto , Owen , we 're just on our way in . How are things looking at the slaughterhouse ? Are you in position ? Yes , it 's all quiet here . There 's a deserted access road to the side . We won 't get noticed . I 'll direct you in . Ianto , nearly there . Take the second turning . Park on the left . No one will see the car there . There 's a main entrance at the front . It 's the only one open . The rest are padlocked and alarmed . How many are in there ? It 's difficult to tell , there are no windows . I 've got blueprints of the warehouse . The stock has to be in the central area . Having fun ? You don 't know what you 're missing . According to the sensor , there 's a heat signature across the entire building . That 's a lot of meat . Answer the phone , Gwen ! You two take the sides , Gwen and I will go in the front . We don 't want any casualties . We stun gun whoever 's in there and put a stop to what they 're doing . Let 's go . There 's someone there . It 's Rhys . It 's ... What 's he doing ? Did you bring the alarm deactivator ? Well , that 's one way of doing it . He must be in on it . Don 't bother running , mate . Never . No . Greg , we 've got a bit of a problem , bruv . How else do you explain that ? Ianto , Owen . Stand down . Repeat , stand down . He told me he didn 't know what was going on . He wouldn 't lie to me . He also said he didn 't know where they were based , but he did . There 's something wrong . There has to be . Gwen ! No . - No ! - Come with me . - I just have to get him out . - What , by charging in there ? What then ? You gonna knock him out ? Look , lads . I don 't mean any harm , honestly . You can 't just go in there . You have to do as I say . We wait until he comes out . Boys , you should have waited for the Ketamine injection before doing that . - What about the hoses ? - That 's only lidocaine . It 's not strong enough . Well , if you care so much , go and work for the RSPCA . - Or don 't they pay as good ? - Oi , you , through here . Shift ! I want you and one of those with me now ! - Who sent you ? - Come on now , don 't waste our time . No one sent me . I , erm ... I came on my own . I 'm looking for the boss . - You 're looking at him . - Ignore my little brother . I 'm ... I 'm from Harwood 's , Harwood 's Haulage . Leighton ... Leighton , your driver , he , um ... Well , he , er ... He sort of told me what was going on like . Mouthy git . He was paid to keep quiet . Shh . Yeah , well , he 's dead . - Lorry crashed . - With the goods inside ? What happened to the meat ? Did anyone see it ? No , no , no . I picked it all up and took it all to be incinerated . You see , um , I was hoping maybe I could pick up from where he left off , boys ? How do we know you won 't report us ? I 'm here , aren 't I ? So what exactly did he tell you ? Everything . You know , that you were cleaning up old meat . Oh , it 's a lot bigger than that . What 's that noise ? - What is it , boys ? - No idea . The beauty of it is , it just keeps growing . No matter how much we cut it . He 'll get used to it . I don 't get it . Come on , let 's go . - What were you doing in that warehouse ? - You lied to me ! You were at that crash . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Stop pissing me around , Gwen ! You 're so used to lying , fobbing me off , like the idiot that I obviously am ! Are those blokes paying you ? Why were you there ? No ! I 'm asking the questions , all right ! I followed you , okay ? Yeah . So that bloke , the tall bloke in the coat , you fucking him or what ? All I ever asked was you trust me . What , like you trust me ? It 's a two-way street , Gwen ! There 's stuff you don 't understand , Rhys . Oh , of course not ! I 'm just a big dumb animal , aren 't I ? What 's so secret you can 't even tell your own fiancé , eh ? In fact , why are you marrying me , Gwen , eh ? What am I , just a habit you can 't be arsed to break ? - No . - Then tell the truth ! All right ! All right , my job , the Special Ops thing , it 's a lie , a cover story . Thank you . At last ! God , what 's that taken , about a year ? That 's one lie down , how many more have we got to deal with , eh ? Is there anything in your life that 's actually based on truth ? - Us . - Us ? Us ? Us is crumbling , Gwen ! Us is falling to shit ! You think I enjoy keeping all this stuff to myself ? - Then why did you ? - Because I 'm trying to protect you ! Have you ever stopped to think about that ? No . No , because you prefer to blunder in without thinking or looking , good old ham-fisted Rhys . His heart is in the right place , but his brain is a million miles fucking back . Let 's have it all , shall we ? What exactly do I need protecting from ? I catch aliens . - Piss off . - No , you piss off ... If you 're not gonna take it seriously ... This is why I couldn 't tell you because I hunt down aliens , and I scavenge the stuff they leave behind . - Sometimes I don 't believe it myself . - Jesus Christ , what 's got into you ? Have you been brainwashed , is that it ? Is that what 's happened ? 'Cause you are talking some high-grade shit here . Every word is the truth . Rhys , the things I have seen ... The times I have wanted to tell you ... Aliens ? In Cardiff . Have you never seen something so mad , so extraordinary , that just for one second you think that there might be more out there ? Prove it . Well , this is unprecedented . The fiancé finding out . Mainly because we 're all sad and single . Speak for yourself . I am better off without all that kind of hassle . Maybe the answer is to go out with someone who knows what you do . Look around you , Tosh . Only we know what we do . I saw you a bit earlier , with him , that bloke . He just appeared out of nowhere . It 's an invisible lift . Oh , it 's too complicated to explain . Come on , trust me . - Ready ? - Yeah . Wow ! Who 'd have thought this was here ? Ooh ! - That looked so real . - It was real . - They 're extinct , Gwen . - Oh , boy . In your time-line , yes . Captain Jack Harkness . Thanks for dropping in , Rhys . This is the rest of the team . Owen and Toshiko , Ianto . Pleased to meet you . - Welcome to our headquarters . - It 's a bit bigger than mine . - So Gwen tells me you catch aliens . - That 's right . There 's a rift through space and time that runs through Cardiff and stuff slips through it from other time-lines and planets , and it 's our job to monitor it . Are you sure they 're not some kind of weird cult ? You saw that alien in the warehouse . Go on . What did you see ? It was like this huge shapeless beast , filling the space . Like a mound of flesh . So it 's one massive entity as opposed to several organisms ? The latest tests reveal high levels of chloride , so it probably lived in the water . I reckon it came through the rift into the sea and it 's beached itself . Like a giant alien manatee . But how did they get it there ? That warehouse must be 50 metres long . Maybe it was smaller when they found it because they said it 's growing . - It 's not dead ? - No , it 's breathing . Its eye opened . So the protein chains are regenerating despite the mutilation . So not only is it replenishing its own flesh , but it 's increasing it , giving them a brand new meat supply . It 'll last them for years , then . If we understood how it worked , we could feed the world . - We could release a single . - Before we get ahead of ourselves , we 're talking about dodgy pies in Merthyr , okay ? And the fact that they 're cutting it up alive , which we could have put a stop to already if it wasn 't for you . I thought my fiancée was in danger . Well , Mr Caveman , she wasn 't . She can handle herself . - Jack . - All you did tonight was mess things up . Now we have to think of a way to get back in and , thanks to you , they 'll have tightened security . Well , if you stopped and asked me exactly what I saw in there instead of showing off round the place . - Do I show off ? - Just a bit . You 'd know that I got out by telling them I wanted a job as a delivery boy . So rather than cock things up , I 've found you a way to get in . But if you can 't handle that , big boy , then you can stuff it ! - This is quite homoerotic . - No . No , no , no , Jack . - He is not getting us in . - Team meeting . You , too . Jack ! That 's where the thing is . That 's the sedatives room . That 's where they hang and pack all the meat . - That 's good to know . - Yeah , that is good to know . - But he 's not driving us in . - They 're expecting me . - You can hide in the back of the van . - What is this , Scooby Doo ? Absolutely no way is he getting involved . Oh , where was I when you decided to get involved ? - Did you give me a second thought ? - Oh , joy , a domestic . Rhys is right , he 's our best way in . Stun guns only . We 've handled bigger than this . Why don 't we just storm in , - guns in the air and arrest them ? - Those men aren 't organized criminals . If we go in guns blazing , they 'll kill the evidence and run . I wasn 't suggesting blazing . Just waving . - The last thing we need is a blood bath . - Point taken . - I know that ... - Once Rhys has loaded up , he can clear . You don 't have to come . You can stand down . It might be better . You love him . Makes you vulnerable . - He 's not going in there without me . - That 's your decision . Yes , it is . You both have to live by it . - Aw , come on , you and me , a team ! - Damn it , Rhys ! This is for real , do you understand that ? This is for real ! And if you mess up , I will kill you ! So after we 've stun-gunned the workers , we put the creature out of its misery . No . We 're going to save it . Stabilize it , wait for the rift to open and send it back . Guess who 'll have to look after it in the meantime . Tell me exactly how we are going to use it to arm ourselves against the future ? - We could always hide behind it . - Why shouldn 't we save it ? Because it 's an alien ? It needs our protection . You didn 't hear its cry . Heartbreaking . - Listen to Ahab . - Jack , it 's growing . Well , we 'll find a way to stop it mutating . We are doing this . - That 's an order . - Fine . I 'll stock up on plankton . So you do have a heart ? We see enough death . What 's that ? Oh , it 's just an idea of what it looks like . I had it made up from the genetic make-up . It looks lovely . You 're just a big softie , really , aren 't you ? - I 'd better get on with that report . - I brought you some sandwiches . - Thanks , Tosh . - It 's okay , just cheese and pickle . I can keep you company . I 'm not tired . In that case , maybe you could do it . I 'm knackered . That 's another big lump out of its habitat . Makes you realise , maybe it is possible to do this job and have a relationship . Do you fancy a game of pool sometime ? We 're always in here , slaving away . It might be nice to , I don 't know , kick back and have some fun . - Yeah , why not ? - When ? Well , I 'll check with the others . We could have a Torchwood tournament . Be fun . Thanks for the sandwiches , Tosh . I thought you worked for anti-terrorism or something , that was bad enough , but knowing you are in this much danger . Yeah , you 'd feel like I do now . Worried sick . You don 't have to do this to prove anything to me . And I 'm not leaving you with all these sexy young men . There 's only one from where I 'm sitting . - Sure about this ? - Yeah . 'Cause once they ring , there 's no turning back . - Morning . - You just missed the advert . Yeah ? Just popped in for my jacket and to sign for a van . Here 's your tea . And I got you a Danish , your favourite . - I 'm in the wrong job . - We have got job vacancies . - Maybe you could fit me in . - I 'd be delighted to . Would I need a license for trucking ? Yes . Takes four weeks , and then you can go long distance . That wouldn 't be a problem . It 's them . Okay . Yeah , hello ? Why her ? Of all the women you could have chosen ? She chose us . Kind of stumbled upon us . So did I , doubt you 'll be asking me to join . We needed someone with police skills . Could have chosen anyone . Did you ever think about us ? You know , me , her parents , people who love her ? Who want her safe ? No . I 'm sorry . We needed her . On her first day of work , she told me off for being too clinical . She doesn 't hold back , mind . - Stubborn as hell . - Tell me about it . Yeah , she 's an amazing girl . I 'm a lucky man , Jack . - Yeah , you said it . - I just wish you were a bit uglier . You 're not gay by any chance , are you ? Brought you a Danish , your favourite . I know what you 're like on an empty stomach . Cheers . - Get out as soon as you can , remember . - Yes , yes , yes . - I love you . - I love you , too . Now stop fussing and get in the back of the van . Go on . I 'll prepare an antidote to the Ketamine so we can start weaning it off . Gwen , Tosh and I will take the main area . Owen , Ianto , cover the corridors and the small rooms . - You okay ? - What do you think ? He 'll be fine . He 's a good bloke . Let 's go . Yeah , I just need your boss to sign this , mate . I don 't want any questions asked , see . You couldn 't get us a cup of tea , could you ? Yes . Where do you want my autograph ? Er ... - Er , just on there , mate . - Here 's a oner for your trouble . - Count it if you like . - No , no , it 's fine , mate , I trust you . When you get to the abattoir , ask for Graham . Him and the boys clean it up and process it . All right . Mmm . Oh , my God . It 's amazing . How did it get here ? Shh ! Imprisoned , chained and drugged . Welcome to planet Earth . It heard you . It 's sentient . Jack . Oh , that 's disgusting . What have they done to you ? What have they done to you , my poor friend ? Everyone . They 're armed . - Rhys . - Gwen , stay here . Where have you been ? An injection was due 10 minutes ago . I needed more Ketamine . I 've had to up the dose , Dale . - The thing 's in agony , man . - It 's meat . It can 't feel anything . You going soft or what ? Get inside and play nurse if you 're so bothered . We 've got work to do . Whoa , whoa , whoa , hang on . There 's only 12 bags in here . He 's supposed to have three more . Come on , hurry up ! Hello , I have a thingy here , somewhere . Hell of a day . I should be getting off , mate . I 've ... - I 've got jobs backing up , you see . - Well , they 'll have to wait , won 't they ? Dale , we got trouble . There 's people in the building . You want to mess with me ? - Ianto , did Rhys get away ? - I 'll check now . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ! You looking for someone ? How many more of you ? Just us . You thought the two of you could take us out ? Nah , you 're not that stupid . Dave , get some ropes , tie their hands . I want every door locked inside and out . Nobody leaves the building till this is sorted . Move it . They 've got Rhys and Ianto . - Gwen . No , Gwen . - Let go ! Hey . It will be okay . - Locked . - There 's no way here . This way . - What is it ? - The lads call it the cash cow . Dale , what are you doing ? They couldn 't bear to see us making money , Vic . Fancied some for yourselves , eh ? Thought we 'd be a pushover ? Mate , you are so out of your depth . It 's funny , I was just thinking the same about you . Dale , don 't be an idiot ! Show yourselves or I shoot the delivery boy . Okay . There 's no need to make any threats . Just the two of you , is it ? - Gun down , kick it over here . - I don 't have a gun ... - He had one , so you must have . - Okay . Okay . Any more of you ? And before you answer , have a proper think . 'Cause if you lie , I will shoot you . There 's just me . - Get against the drum . - We can help you out , Dale . Yeah , help yourselves more like . Come on , stand next to her . You , too . Dale ! Two more . Far corner . They can 't get out , it 's locked . Take out your weapons , stand where I can see you . Drop your weapons . - You know what you 've got here , Dale ? - Shut up now . It 's an alien . A creature from another galaxy . It came through a rift in time and space , and it was unlucky enough to find you . No . No way . Did you really think it originated on this planet ? Have you ever seen anything like it before ? It can 't be . Can it ? Look at it . It 's just meat . That 's all . You 're carving up a sentient creature , and you 've got to stop . And then what 've I got ? I 'm making money here ! This is my business ! For the first time in my life , I 've actually got something for myself ! Dale , stop , you can still walk away from this . No . You lied to me . No ! Die ! Shit . Ianto ! Go ! After them ! Owen , Rhys has been shot . The creature 's coming loose , we need that sedative now ! Open your eyes , come on , you can do this . Open your eyes now , okay ? Yeah , I 'm on it ! I 'm on it . Owen , we need you ! We 're trapped , the creature 's breaking free . If we try and get past , we 'll be crushed . It wasn 't me ! I never wanted to be a part of this . Sedatives won 't work now . If it 's got loose , you 're never gonna stop it ! We 've gotta help them . It 's out of control . Change of plan . You went and shot him , bruv ! Come on ! - Go , go , fill the other one . - I 'm going as fast as I can . Pray they survive . Bloody hell . I 'm sorry . He 's okay . Owen , you 're making it worse ! Open your eyes . You can do it . Come on . It 's working . Yeah . It 's working . What did you do ? Mercy killing . Rhys , Rhys , listen to me , listen to me . That 's it . Breathe with me , okay ? I 've got you tight , keep your eyes nice and open . Gwen , let me look at him . Okay . Stop , stop , stop ... Okay . I 'm going to rip this . Keep the pressure on , okay ? Okay . I 'm so sorry . So sorry . Here he is . Hero of the hour . - Hey . - Hey . Are you all right ? I am now you are , yeah . - Sorry . - Next time , let her take the bullet . Never . - What happened to the blokes ? - We gave them amnesia pills . They 'll remember who they are , but not what they did over the past few months . - So they got away with it ? - It 'd never stand up in a court of law . And the creature ? Incinerated . So there 's nothing left . - It was never there . - Gwen , I need a word . Sure . Rhys has to forget , too , you know . At least let me give it to him at home . Let 's not go home just yet . Rhys , you 've just been shot . I know . Come on , let 's go for an ice cream . Look around us . Nobody else knows what we 've been through . Or what else is out there . The sky won 't be the same to me any more . I used to look up and think , " Ah , looks like rain , man , " but now , oh , now I 'll ... I 'll look and I 'll think of all the other worlds and the planets and stuff spinning around out there . And I got to be a part of it all . Fantastic ! Which puts worrying about unsigned dockets into perspective , I can tell you . You 've got some ... Some ice cream on your chin . Gone ? I want to know about all of it , about every alien you 've ever seen . You could take photos . I 'll keep a scrapbook . Wouldn 't show no one , no way . No , because you won 't be keeping one . And , you know , I 'm even cool about Jack . Yeah , all right , yeah , he 's handsome , enigmatic , saves the world and all that , but it 's me you come home to at the end of it all . And I always will . Hey , Daf ! All right ? Oh , nothing much , same old , same old . Yeah . What ? No way ! - I 'm not doing it . I won 't drug him . - You have to . - You can 't allow him to remember . - It 's the rules . But none of you have any partners outside of this . - But we understand how you feel . - No , you don 't . No , you don 't , Jack . You all think it 's cold and lonely out there . But it isn 't for me , because I have him . He matters . And I 've lied to him for long enough . What he did today was so brave , braver than any of us because we signed up for this , but he didn 't . He did it because he loves me . And I won 't take that away from him . I won 't . And if that means I have to quit or you retcon me or whatever , then fine , fine . You really think you could go back to your old life before Torchwood ? - I wouldn 't know anything different . - I would . Give Rhys my love , and I will see you tomorrow . If he comes after me again , I 'll kill him . I love you . Oh , God , say something . - You okay with that ? - I have been for the last three years . I killed three girls , and it felt so good . - Would you die for me ? - Yes . Why did you come here ? I 'm the one you can confide in , remember ? I buried the memory over 150 years ago . Greg . My little brother . I can 't afford to remember . Drop the gun , Jack ! And you always remember what you killed . Don 't you , Jack ? I let go of his hand . It was the worst day of my life .

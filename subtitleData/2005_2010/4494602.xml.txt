 You were right . Earth won 't make it . The last ones have left earth to join us , but there is no more room here . Epidemics are spreading ever faster . I 'm not able to keep up . The people are dying in my arms . I applied as a doctor on a cargo ship . 4 years there and 4 years back . I 'll spend most of the time in hibernation . This single flight ... and I 'll have enough money to ... go to Rhea . Then we 'll finally be together again . Did you hear my dear sister ? I have to go . I want to go to Rhea to see you and the kids again . Dr. Laura Portmann ? Anna Lindbergh , first officer . Welcome aboard . Everybody listen . Miyuki Yoshida , system administrator . This loudmouth here is Vespucci . Prokoff isn 't as talkative , thank God . Dr. Portmann . Station 42 will be upgraded to a transport hub . It 's in the Orth Cloud , halfway to Proxima ... and is in a stable orbit around RH278 . The autopilot is activated . Because of all the recent terror attacks ... the transitional government has ordered ... that there be a sky marshal on every ship . Damn narks . It is said , that the " Maschinen Stuermer " are ... preparing for major sabotage acts . This ship is so decrepit already , no one would sabotage anything . Lt. Samuel Decker . Space Security Agency . We will seal the cargo hold in 30 minutes . If you want to get to know each other , now 's your chance . At 0200 the engines will start . At 0230 we will meet at the cryo-chambers . I hope you have a good stay . According to resolution 278 of the RBS ... there will be sky marshals even on cargo flights from now on . Just accept me as a part of the crew . " This is an information broadcast of the TSA . " " The threat of terror attacks has never been greater since The Collapse . " " Klaus Bruckner is still at large after the terror attack . " " This man is responsible for the earlier bombings ... " on stations 20 , 23 and 24 . " " While he is claiming responsibility for the current attacks ... " " he keeps on propagating the messages of the " Maschinen Stuermer " . " " We are living in machines . " " What are we producing ? Machines . " " Our enemy is the TSA . " " There will be no peace as long as technology is ruling us . " " Down with the machines ! " " Down with the stations ! " " Because of the latest incidents , the TSA has decided ... " " so as to ensure the safety of the ship and crew ... " " that every flight be supervised by a security officer . " " Support the sky marshal on his duty and ... " Listen everybody , this will be the order of shifts . Each shift lasts 8 and a half months . I 'll take the first . Then Lindbergh ... Yoshida ... Vespucci ... Prokoff ... Portmann . At the end of unloading , Lindbergh again . And if someone has any problems ... he can knock on Decker 's tank . " Dear Laura , " " I 'm sending you some sunshine from Rhea . " " I haven 't held you in my arms for such a long time ... " " It 's not good that you are doing cargo flights . " " We are worried . " " People are telling each other that the " Maschinen Stuermer " " are becoming more and more aggressive . " " But what do you expect us to believe from information that 's 4 years old ? " " I don 't even want to think about what could have happened in the meantime . " " I really hope that you are doing well . " " Please stay in touch . " " See you soon . " " I miss you . " Initiation of day phase Day phase commencing Beginning of night phase . Please adopt rest position . Dear Arianne , I miss you too . It is so unbelievably cold in here , you couldn 't imagine . I 'll show you a few images , so you can picture this junk ship . Well ... Just 2 months left 'til the end of my shift . We are 4 light years away from Earth . And are transporting materials to build a station , so that one day , we will be able to fly to Proxima . It isn 't clear if there are any inhabitable planets . I really want to be with you . Please don 't worry , I 'm doing fine . See you soon . Beginning of night phase . Please adopt rest position . What are you doing here ? Someone opened the cargo hold . I was automatically woken up . Why did you open up the door ? You know that it is strictly forbidden to enter the cargo hold . Something is inside the cargo hold . That 's impossible . Something is behind the door . We have to wake the crew . No , the hibernation phases must be kept intact . But why don 't you show it to me ? The rules say that under exceptional circumstances ... we have to wake up the captain . It seems as if Dr. Portmann isn 't able to handle loneliness very well . I 'm sorry that we 've awakened you . Let 's just hope that you are sure . The cold suits have been thrown around because of the high pressure . The bulkhead was opened several times during your shift . I hope for your sake that this was just a technical problem . Come on , then . The cargo hold is split up into 9 sectors . You take A to C. You take D to F. And I 'll take the rest . Shouldn 't we stay together ? I don 't want to stay overnight . We 'll stay in radio contact ... The containers are all locked . That is as it should be . You should know that Decker . Haven 't found anything suspicious yet ... Except that we are not fully loaded . Answer . Me either . Roger . Keep searching . Over . Lacroix , here Laura . Lacroix ! Fuck ! Decker ? Decker ! " What happened ? " I think Lacroix has fallen down . " What ? Where are you ? " In sector E4-20 . I 'm going down to sector G. " I 'm coming ! " Lacroix ! Do you hear me ? Lacroix , do you hear me ? Is he still alive ? We must get him out of the cold now ! The door ! According to the regulations , I 'll be in command of the ship . Prokoff , Vespucci , fix the door . The cargo hold must be sealed as soon as possible . Yoshida , you 'll verify all entries in the main computer ... and check for suspicious activities . And you will examine Lacroix 's body . I want an exact cause of death . Start recording . Multiple spine fracture . Cranio-cerebral injury . Apparently caused by a fall from a great height . Time of death : a few minutes after impact . I thought that we were just transporting construction materials . So did I. What 's wrong with the door ? It 's buggered , jammed , and the gears are buggered too . It must have been here . Sealed . I have Lacroix 's I.D. card . A child . It 's a child ! Most of the containers are full of people . " Vespucci , Prokoff . " Yes ? " Please come to sector F7-21 . " Why the devil are we transporting people to Station 42 ? Fuck ! That 's really ... Shit ! Run ! Go go go ! Laura ! Laura ! What 's going on here ? The containers are full of people . The cargo is the shipping companies ' business . Lacroix was murdered . Lacroix opened the door and the high pressure ... in the container pushed him over the edge . Someone set the containers in motion and we got almost killed . The containers move automatically , to prevent freezing . That 's the reason why it 's forbidden to go into the cargo hold . There is somebody on board the ship . He killed Lacroix and almost got us too . Did you know that there are people in the containers ? This tank will be returned immediately . This is a person ! As a doctor , I am responsible for the people on board . And I will examine this girl now . I agree . And furthermore I am authorized to investigate the incident . The containers with the tanks may have something to do with Lacroix 's death . Then do your duty . But you can be sure that I will report this incident . Inspecting tank . Starting record . No usable scans from the abdomen retrievable . Switching to high frequency . HF scans in the head area possible . The girl shows weak brain activity , A result of the hibernation coma . Stopping record . Did you find anything ? It will take some time to get precise results . May I help ? Yes , maybe . The tank is blocking the scanner and it 's secured with an electronic lock . Have you found anything ? I need anything you can find on Decker . Something is wrong with him . He should be on our side . And ? - Because of an asymmetric RSA encryption It could take some time . What do you know about Station 42 ? An uninhabited station . It is being upgraded to a transport hub for ships heading to Proxima . And unofficially ? Why did you enlist for this mission ? I need money , that 's it . You want to go to Rhea . Yes . Why ? My sister lives on Rhea . She gained her visa for Rhea 7 years ago . She is living our dream . Probably the automatic sorting again . And if there is really something on board ? Fuck it . Let 's just try to fix this mess ASAP . Starting record . The girl 's brain is woven through with inorganic tissue . Entry of the tissue into the body ... Cervical C4 , neck vertebra . Looks like something growing in Or inserted . A VR connector . Apparently a demanding one . I 've never seen anything like this . We could connect her to an external system . That 's too dangerous . That could lead to irreparable neural damage . That 's the only way to get more information about the connector . Under no circumstances . I will not risk the child 's life . Very well . For now , better keep the results of the examination just between us . Ok ? Hello Hanna . So much stuff is going on here ... that I could tell you . Why are we that far away from each other ? And it takes ages for messages to arrive . I just don 't understand what 's happening on board anymore . We found a girl in the cargo hold . I 'm trying to help her . We 'll see each other soon . And then I 'll tell you everything . I was so delighted to receive your message ! It 's so good to hear your voice and know that you are alive . You found a girl ? I don 't get it . I would like to talk to you in person . Why is it taking so long for our messages to arrive ? Laura , listen . We don 't want you to do any more cargo flights . Come directly to Rhea . You could stay with us for a while . We will prepare a room for you and ... I 'm looking forward to seeing you . You 'll be with us soon . I don 't get what 's happening here . How is it possible that my sister answered this fast ? Why do you know about neuronal ports ? Why shouldn 't I tell anybody about the examination ? What do you know about the people in the tanks ? Who the hell are you ? First officer Lindbergh here . Everybody report to the bridge ASAP . Yoshida has compared all log entries to those in backup . She has discovered that a crew member has manipulated the log files of the cryo-chambers . Why didn 't you tell us that you have been awakened on a regular basis ? It 's part of my duties to check the ship periodically . So you are not denying that you left the cryo-chambers without our knowledge ? No , that is correct . Where were you when Lacroix died ? I knew it ! Come clean ! I was in sector F5-17 . And you can 't demand an account for the work I am doing for RBS . Arrest him . Put your weapon away ! I have immunity . You know that . Not if you are suspected of murder . Put your weapon away ! I might have believed you if you hadn 't resisted . Vespucci , how much more time do you need with the cargo door ? 48 hours . Dr. Portmann , return that tank to the cargo hold ASAP . That 's impossible . I gave the patient a drug that reduces muscle contractions . She is not stable . She can 't be returned . I 'm not interested ! I want that tank returned before the door is closed . This is an order ! Have I made myself clear ? Get him to the cryo-chambers . He must go to the medical station first . I must treat his wounds or the blood will contaminate the cooling fluid . You do that well . Did you receive another message from your sister ? Vespucci , medical station please . Laura ! Laura wait ! We are not flying to Station 42 . Where are we heading then ? To Rhea . Could you do me a favour ? Would you please take a look if we are really heading for Station 42 ? And ? I was on the bridge and locked into the system . The target coordinates of our flight are well protected , but ... I can tell you for certain that we are not heading for Station 42 . And it 's also definite that ... nobody would 've been able to change the coordinates during the journey . Because you can only set them before the departure . I 'm trying to figure out where else we might fly into . But that means that Decker never able to change the coordinates . How long does it take a message to arrive at Rhea ? Most likely an eternity . As always . Several years ? My sister answered me within 20 minutes . If that 's true , then Lindbergh has lied to us . Only she has the login for the target coordinates . Decker told me that we are flying to Rhea . Hey hey hey , look who 's here ! The door has been fixed . And that 's why Prokoff and I are throwing a little party in the squad rooms . I don 't have any time . Got things to finish off . And what about our little party ? Thanks for your help ! But you are coming , right ? We heated the room extra . You won 't stay that long either , right ? The last doctor left afterwards for Rhea . Our lot will never be able to afford that . Doesn 't taste so bad ! Probably the radiator . What are you doing ? The party isn 't over yet . I 'll take Yoshida some tea . Ok ... but hurry . And make sure Lindbergh doesn 't notice anything . She 'd ruin our party . Don 't worry , I 'll be right back . Yoshida ? Decker ... That son of a bitch is gone . If I get my hands on him ... He was woken up manually . Someone must have let him out . So we have a stowaway on board after all . Shit ... We 'll search the whole ship . You go with Portmann . I 'll go with Prokoff . We 'll start on the main section . I 'll lock all cargo bay entries . If we don 't find anything , then we 'll check the rest . Sick bay is clear . What 's your situation ? Nothing so far . We 're at the airlock . There 's something below us . Let 's check out the lower deck . Looks like we 've found him . He must be in this duct . Ok ... you go in here . I 'll come from the other side . We 'll kick his ass . Once he notices that I 'm front of him , he 'll have to turn around . When you see him , you shoot . Boom , over and out . That bastard ... he killed Yoshida and Lacroix . Don 't forget that . ... blow ... up ... Everything is growing like it used to . We 've been lied to from the very beginning . These plants here ... they 're edible . The greenhouses keep out the acid rain . We purify our own water in the underground tanks . We 're completely independent from the system . And we continue to grow stronger . More people join us every day . Don 't move ! Laura ... Thank God , you 're alive . - Vespucci ! - Calm down . Where the devil were you ? We have everything under control . We have him . Did you have to shoot him ? Who is that ? Bruckner ... What was your plan ? No point in playing the hero . Bruckner is dead . Who are you trying to protect ? Rhea ... is a simulation , a lie . The people in the tanks ... Imbecile . Their brains are being used as neural units to create the simulation . We talk to the people on Rhea all the time . Kuiper is lying to all of humanity . Everything is being systematically kept secret . Get him out of here . If people knew that parts of Earth were habitable again ... then the whole system would break down . You killed him , didn 't you ? He was crazy . He killed Lacroix . And Yoshida ? Move it . How 's your little patient ? Good . I think we can move her back into the cargo hold . Excellent . Prokoff and Vespucci will give you a hand . Then we can finally close the cargo hold and ... you 'll go into cryo-sleep . I will handle your shift . So you know something about Rhea ... The simulation is only a temporary solution . The colonization of Rhea was a failure from the start . Our changes to the planet 's ecosystem caused unforeseen consequences . We will find another planet . And we won 't repeat the mistakes we made on Rhea . But until then ... people need something to keep them alive . And that thing is hope . What happens to those who find out they 're living in a simulation ? The simulation is perfect ... I was in there myself . It 's impossible for anyone to notice anything . Why are you doing all this ? You just don 't get it . Soon we 'll be on Rhea . But you and your ... saboteur ... won 't make it there alive . No one will care about the death of the ones who murdered the captain . Did you know that we were flying to Rhea ? But ... Rhea is a simulation ... I don 't give a shit . Better than staying on this rust heap . What about all my plants ? You idiot , there will be more plants than you ever dreamed of . On Rhea , there is everything . Everything . I couldn 't tell you the truth . Laura ... there 's many reasons not to trust me ... But we are the only ones who can finish this mission . Will you help me ? Will you help me get my sister out of the tank ? We need 2 people to do this . It 's impossible to enter the simulation on your own . We 'll dock at Station 42 according to plan . We can delay the unloading procedure by 30 minutes at most . The Kassandra will then unload automatically . Laura and I will disembark at the station . And we 'll log into the system . And how does that work ? The hardware used for the simulation is here , in the connection module . With this pre-programmed interface , I will connect Laura ... directly into the simulation here in the main module . Once she 's in , she will send a message from Rhea to Earth . Meanwhile , I 'll go look for her sister 's tank . When we 're done , we 'll blow up the transponder of the main antenna . The station itself stays fully operational . That means ... Everyone will keep living in the simulation . But they won 't be able to send any more messages . Laura 's message ... will be the last . I hope people back home will believe us . Is the Earth really habitable again ? We 've had 3 expeditions . Nature is rampant . She 's taking everything back . Whole cities are grown over up to the 2nd floor . I 'll bring Arianne back to Earth . There 's millions of tanks , Laura ... Even if we do find her ... I don 't know what condition she 'll be in . She was in the simulation for a long time . We have to try . I want to show her the Earth ... Has this interface been used before ? No , it 's a prototype . It works like a neural connection for the simulation . Don 't be scared . 27 minutes . Don 't you think we should ... ? What ? I 'm doing this for you , and me . For both of us ! As if I 'll let this pass us by . We 'll tip some guys out of their tanks and go in ourselves . When the ship is unloaded , we 'll be on Rhea ! God damn it ... Prokoff . Do you hear me ? I have Lindbergh 's card . Reprogram the unloading timer for 10 minutes , got it ? Otherwise those 2 will make it back ... and the containers won 't be unloaded ... and we won 't be on Rhea , got it ? We have to hurry ... let 's meet in the cargo hold , ok ? Decker ? Can you hear me ? I 'm having problems with my fuel cell . The cell isn 't working right . [ scrambled ] Under no circumstances ... open ... door Rhea , here we come ! Haven 't you found ... the container ... I 'm coming anyway ... I don 't think that 's a good idea . Stay where you are ... I 'm trying to find Arianne 's tank . Laura ... copy .. ? Decker , can you hear me ? Decker ! I can 't control my jetpack anymore ! I 'm drifting off ! Decker ! Where are you ? ! Decker ... where are you ? I see you . I found Arianne 's tank ... Impossible ... I 'm sorry . I want to see her . Set the module to my sister 's simulation . I 'll send the message from there . The Kassandra . Prokoff and Vespucci ... Those idiots . That means we have 7 minutes at the most ... then I 'll get you out manually . OK . Look how beautiful we have it here ... At last you can actually see it . Finally ... And your room is almost ready too ! You look beautiful . Come in . I 'll show you everything . Kids , look who 's here ! Laura , are you crying ? Arianne , I have to go for a minute . What 's wrong ? I love you , Arianne . Laura , where are you going ? My name is Laura Portmann . This is the last message from Rhea . Rhea is not paradise . Rhea is a simulation . We will bring you proof . We were all betrayed . Everything about Rhea is a lie . We don 't need Rhea . However , we still have Earth . Earth is habitable again . Nobody will have any contact with Rhea again . We 're destroying the antennas now . Do you hear me ? Yes . Good , we must hurry . The Kassandra could launch anytime now ... and you 'll have to go back on your own . On my own ? Yes . I 'm not leaving without you . You have to . We won 't make it far with only one jetpack . I gave you my fuel cell . It has enough fuel to get you to the Kassandra . I 'm not leaving without you . Go back to the girl . She 's our only proof . Go . I can 't ! You can . No ... I love you . Where is the girl ! ? No one will be able to send messages from Rhea now . My name is Laura Portmann . This is the last message from Rhea . Rhea is not paradise . Rhea is a simulation . We will bring you proof . We were all betrayed . We don 't need Rhea . However , we still have Earth . Earth is habitable again . Nobody will have any contact with Rhea again . We 're destroying the antennas now .

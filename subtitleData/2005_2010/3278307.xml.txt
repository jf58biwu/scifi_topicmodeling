Could Matt have been dealing ? 2 days ago , I would haveNsaid no way , but now- - we need access to your place . We have to find that codebook . Yeah , I 'll get you a key . We 're staying atNmy sister-in-law 'S . Irene just can 't stay at home . It uses " h " more than any other letter . Probably a substitute for " E " , Nthe most common letter in the alphabet .

The line was endless . How you doing ? You must be Hallie . I 'm John Amsterdam . Omar 's told me a lot about you . Like what ? That you never cried as a baby . She was like a little porcupine . Still is . So don 't get too close . It 's late . I have to get Corey to bed . See you , Corey . Remember . Remember what ? My babysitter , he can 't die . Come on . You 're in a world of pain , Tommy . We got you on burg 2 , Npossession of a controlled substance , possession ofNburglar 's tools- - Matt gave me a key . We 'll check that out with him . Wait a second . We can 'T . He 's dead . Murder 2 . You 're trippin ' . All right ? I wasn 't anywhe near Matt 'sNplace on saturday night . Really ? We found this earring in Matt 's bed . How 'd you lose it , Tommy ? During sex ? You boys have a lovers ' quarrel ? You don 't think I 'm straight ? Think I can prove it to you . Yeah . You wouldn 't last the night .

Only we can . Ok . We sold a little blow . All right ? Matt needed the money . He couldn 't make itNon scholarship alone . You ever deal roofies ? That 's for sleazebags . Your notes showed youNowed your supplier large . What happened ? Look , I just asked MattNto borrow some product . But he said no , so you got into it . He was alive when I left . I swear . Ask Marika Soloway . She was there ? They were getting back together . I left before she did . You ever sail , Tommy ? You good with knots ? I get seasick . Hello , George . I want you to show Miss BrownNto my table when she arrives , ok ? This arrived for you , sir . " My darling , my father was right . " " I was living in a wonderland . " " But this is reality . " " I can 't see you anymore . " " Please don 't call me or try to contactNme , and please don 't hate me . Lily . " Oh , detectives , this isNmy husband Paul Cleary . - He was Matt 's coach.N - Paul . We 'd like to speak with you later . Whatever I can do . Look , I can 't do this now . I 'm speaking at the service . We can always go downtown . I hate this school . Tommy Langer . He 's such a loser . Did you see him at Matt 's that day ? The truth , Marika . They had a fight , ok ? Over drugs ? Why 'd you lie before about being there ? My family , they 're like beyond wasp . They will disown me when theyNfind out I was seeing him . You got back together ? That day . He was alive when I left . And we believe that why ? You don 't believe me ? Stay for the service . But what made Matt specialNwasn 't the 4 : 25 mile he ran . The race he was reallyNinterested in was the human race . Dray is a family . And it 's lost one of its own . Down , down , down into the darknessNof the grave , gently they go , the beautiful , the tender , the kind . Quietly they go . The intelligent , the witty , the brave . You are all such hypocrites . Where were you when he needed you ? " Dray is a family " ? Please . Matt had to deal drugs just to keep up . Coach 's words are nice , now . But why did he kickNMatt off the track team ? And the teacher he wentNto for help , Mrs. Cleary , well , here 's how that bitch was helping . You see ? We all killed Matt . Ain 't life grand ? Marika said she and Matt hadNthe same kind of cell phone . When she left his place , Nshe took the wrong one . The pictures were on it . Well , at least now weNknow who the killer is . Everyone . Are you here to arreste ? Matt was 17 . You beat the law by a year . Lucky me . Want to tell me what happened ? We fell in love . Did your husband know ? He found some emails . That 's why he kicked Matt off the team . He was furious . Understandably . Where was your husband that night ? He was at the movies . - You know which one ? N - No . You think what I did was wrong . I 'm not a judge . Everybody else is . Society makes these distinctions betweenNright and wrong , but the heart doesn 't . It feels what it wants to feel . You like to sail . I used to . So after you found out aboutNthe affair , you confronted Matt ? You have to understand thatNI gave this kid everything . He had talent , but no technique . He could have been major . A--I don 't know--a Jim Ryun . And he pays me back byNsleeping with my wife . I wanted to kill him . So did you ? Where were you that night ? I went to the movies . Alone ? I had some thinking to do . Anyone see you there ? I don 't know . What movie ? I didn 't kill that boy . What movie ? School . How may I help you ? I 'm working with the home secretary , and we 'reNdoing a background check on Hannah Cleary . Understand she taught there . Yes , but I 'm not at liberty to say- - of course . Silly of me . How is the old school ? God , I miss it . It never changes . That 's its charm . Quite . The prince and i wereNjust talking of that . The prince ? Yes . We went to trinity together . A misunderstood man . I really shouldn 't , but the word was thatNMrs . Cleary was inappropriate with a student , a sixth-former , then she left . It was all very hush-hush . You 're doing your country a service . Well , she was a fisherman 's daughter . What can you expect ? Guess what we found on Cleary 's laptop ? He 's been visiting kinky websites . One has photos of sexual asphyxiation . He didn 't do it . We found a bottle ofNrohypnol in his locker . Of course . You think he 's being set up ? I think the heart doesn 'tNdistinguish between right and wrong . Is that a yes ? Because the lieutenant wantsNus to lean on him really hard . We 're losing him . What 's the story ? Looks like an O.D.Guy offed himself . Wife came home and found him . Sure it wasn 't accidental ? He left this . A suicide note . And more . Yeah , I know . A confession . I just hear from the Q-doc , it 's gone take a while , Nbut at first look , they take another ledger . Whatever Q-doc says ... You know I hate that . What ? When you make me think you know something , Nbut you won 't tell me what you think you know . This is the sound of me hanging up . See these ts ? Too regular , too perfect . Look at this , 36 . This little tag at theNsecond " O " in " Honor " . It 's like the writerNstarted to write a " U. " Maybe out of habit , maybe because sheNwas used to spelling it the british way . It 's not bad work . For an art teacher from Brighton . But I could do better . * * * * at least uncle sam wants me . * Name- - Johann van der zee . Date of birth--June 1 , 1607 . Place of birth- - Amsterdam , Holland . So that 's the end of the story , huh , 29 ? You know , Lily did me a favor . She got me to join the army . Maybe if i 'm lucky , I 'll get killed . I don 't understand . Why did you read me my rights ? A formality . We just have a few questions . Please sit down . It has been a hellish week . I 'm sure you understand . Oh , I understand . I thought you 'd likeNto take a look at this . I 've already readNthe suicide note.I- - of course , but this is a note weNfound in your husband 's office . I really think you should read it . What is this ? Some kind of joke ? That would make you the punchline . Paul couldn 't have written this ! It looks like his handwriting . - It 's a lie.N - Is it ? Which part , Hannah ? Where it says that Paul wanted to set the recordNstraight in case something happened to him ? Or where it says that you killed MattNbecause you were crazy with jealousy . I don 't have to listen to this ! And Matt called you that day , toldNyou he was getting back with Marika . That you flipped out , drove toNMatt 's place , spiked his drink , tied his hands with a knot onlyNa fisherman 's daughter would use . Now which part ? Which part is the lie ? I gave Matt everything , Nand he threw it all away . And you overdosed your husbandNand forged his confession . Rohypnol 's legal in England , isn 't it ? Paul figured it out . I had no choice . The way I felt about Matt ... you will never know that kind of love . I hope not . What are you doing ? I never said paul wrote the letter . I only said it lookedNlike his handwriting . Just wanted to let you knowNwe moved back into our place . Irene feels like sheNcan sleep there again . - That 's good.N - Yeah . It 's a start . You kept your promise . You never liked to practice . My hands were too small . You ever see Oscar Peterson 's hands ? Ham hocks . Thought you should have this . There 's an inscription to your mother . It 'll tell you what you need to know . How is he ? 10 fingers , 10 toes . We 're just washing him up . You all alone , honey ? We 're going to need the father 's name . John York . Took 3 trains to get here . Did I miss it ? I never thought I 'd see you again . How did you know ? Well , let 's just say my secretary takesNan unusual interest in my personal life . That 's why you sent me the letter . I found out that day . - I didn 't see another wayN - No , that 's the past . How 's the baby ? Beautiful . In a scrunched up kind of way . It 's for you . Figured you 'd need some sleep . " you will always be the one " I loved your mother , Omar . She was fierce , brave . What ? How 'd you find this ? A lot of firemen comeNin here , buy a few drinks . You 'd be surprised what you could learn . You had the ambulance number wrong . It wasN7-8-9 . The 8 looked like a 3 . She 's an E.R. Doc at St. Francis . Her name is Sara Dillane . Maybe you ought to go find her . Yeah . See you later .

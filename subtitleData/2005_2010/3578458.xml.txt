 So what kind of artifact could cause a gas explosion ? I thought we were gonna get a break . Did you ask Artie ? Yeah , he laughed for about five minutes . I guess that 's an answer . You know , I 'm not asking for two weeks in Tahiti , you know ? I just want a couple days to get out of podunk Dakota and go someplace that serves martinis . Well , you are looking pretty ragged ... you got those bags under your eyes ... What ... I 'm supporting you here . It 's very helpful . Thanks . Secret service . That 's a big-ass generator , huh ? I count six body bags . Excuse me , can I see this body , please ? Oh , God . Kentucky fried , extra crispy . Thank you . - Can I help you ? - Hi , I 'm agent Bering . - This is agent Lattimer . - Captain Powell . - Secret service ? - So what went down here last night ? Underground gas main ruptured . It ignited . City engineers are checking to see if it 's safe . Until then , that 's all I know . Thanks for stopping by . I think I have more questions . You ? Let 's go meet the engineer . Let 's . It 's us again . Look , General , I 'm gonna need a list of all the casualties and a list of all the witnesses to the accident . Well , it 's pretty much the same list ... half a dozen suspects , hadn 't even been processed yet . We 're still trying to confirm the IDs . I wasn 't here , but a desk sergeant and an officer got knocked out by the blast . One 's comatose , and the other one 's in surgery . - I 'm sorry to hear that . - Good . So maybe now you 'll let me get to the ton of paperwork I have ahead of me . What do you think ? Is it safe to go down there ? There 's not much to see , but it appears to be structurally sound . It 's dark . Thanks . So this must 've been a cellar they sealed up when they built the police station . You got a vibe ? Something else happened . Check this out . The explosion must 've blown this door open . I guess he 's been down here quite a while . Secret service . This guy was a Warehouse agent . Projet-SG ( 1.00 ) Look , he has a secret service star , but his ID and his credentials are dust . I 'm sending for the body right now , okay ? And meanwhile , what I want you to do is I want you to get me pictures . Meanwhile , I am gonna find who this agent is , I 'll ID him , and I will find out , if I can , what mission he was on . It looks like the blast opened up the wall , and somehow people were fried . I mean , could an artifact cause an explosion like that ? Or did the explosion release the artifact and then burn everybody up ? Yeah , that is a very good question , Pete , very good question . That 's exactly what you have to figure out . Bye . How the hell ... How the hell ... am I gonna figure out ... who that mysterious agent is ? Unfortunately , the Warehouse filing system never quite caught up to the computer age . Like your wardrobe ? What ? These are Earth tones . They never go out of style . The files on all the Warehouse agents for the last 200 years , give or take , and missing agents , too , somewhere . Excellent . You can teach me about scrapbooking . I 'll call you if I need you . All right , all right , I got my own stuff . Besides , I 'm allergic to old . Myka just sent pics from the scene . We 're getting the actual body later today , so we don 't need that digital crap . Digital 's just as good , Artie . - No . - Welcome to the new millennium . Pixels will never replace the real thing . Pixels ... you know what they are ? They 're just ... look , they 're a start , but they 're ... God , they 're a really small start . But they don 't have to be . They can be so much more . I 've been working on something , okay ? - I really want to show you . - I don 't need any kind of newfangled ... Chill . This is totally old-fangled . Check it out . What is ... Is that ... part of that a Bell Howell spectroscope ? Surprise . I re-purposed it . What , without asking me ? What ... it 's just a hologram projector . It 's perfectly safe . - Now , behold ... - No , I don 't need to behold . - Can we behold a whole other time ? - I 've composited Myka 's pictures and ... Wait , no . No , hold on . No , I know this works . Yeah , I 'm sure it 's fabulous . Can we do this at a more appropriate ... Percussive maintenance . Wait , it gets better . What did you ... what did you do ? I upgraded the whole megillah . Strung together a bunch of Haswells on a Cray XT backbone . I guess keeping me around here wasn 't the worst idea you ever had . What is that ? Is that a ... tattoo on what 's left of his skin there ? Could be . Can you zoom in on that a little bit ? Yeah , I can 't ... I can 't ... Could you digitally reconstruct that ? - Couldn 't any genius whiz kid ? - Okay , you do that . I 'll be in the records room . Oh , God . " Really , God , brilliant job , Claudia . Love the initiative . " " Oh , thank you . Thanks , Artie . " - Nothing on the tapes . - Like I said . I 'm really enjoying our time together . These are the personal effects from the suspects , right ? Yeah , and processing them is a very low priority right now . Yeah , but whoever started the job put out seven trays . But there were only six bodies . Son of a bitch . Son of a bitch . Everybody , drop what you 're doing right now . Which means we might have a survivor or a witness . Or a guy with an artifact that fries people . Reggie Hinton , where are you now ? Give me some of that . - Reggie ? - Shut up . We gotta get outta here , y 'all , now . - He 's coming after us , all of us . - Who is ? Come on . We gotta get outta here now . Reggie ! Wait , Reggie ! Reggie , who is this guy ? It 's him . It 's consistent with a fast , hot fire ... the same as the bodies at the station . Except this time no gas leak . It 's like they were microwaved . We ID 'd this one as Reggie Hinton , your suspect . What killed these guys ? Why is this ... not ... - Okay , it 's an eagle ... - Yeah . And an anchor ... And just a circle , I guess . - Could it be a globe ? - Yeah , why not ? Okay , so eagle , anchor , globe ... He 's a marine . That 's gonna narrow it down . There 's only lee a dozen or so agents who were former marines . You know , we ... we could ... There are more bodies burnt to a crisp , but still no sign of an actual fire . No fire ? Wait a minute . No fire . Okay , so there was ... there was ... There was a Babylonian battery . It was unearthed and then lost again in 1952 in Texas , not Missouri . But there was also a rumor that Edward Teller was working on a micro-fission thing , but it 's not that . Well , here 's a wrinkle . There 's a hand-print on the bodies . It 's the only part not burned , our only suspect was one of the victims . It was like he was , I don 't know , followed from the police station , Artie . No , not like he was followed . He was chased . These deaths are random . So somebody at the station last night found the artifact , whatever it is , - and used it to settle some old scores . - Yeah , okay , you know what ? Trace the victims . See if they 've got enemies , then you can get ahead of this guy before he settles more ... scores . Yeah , if that 's what it was , which I really doubt . Would it have killed you to leave a note ? Captain Powell . Did you know all these burn victims were members of the same gang ? And they were brought in the other night after an altercation with a rival gang . Could this be payback ? It 's just what we need ... a turf war with a new kind of weapon in play . Okay , we 're gonna need names , addresses , whatever you 've got . The head of our gang unit , Sergeant Clark , is out on leave . As soon as I get in touch with him , I will put him through to you . And this is Clark ? Till then , this is his latest stuff . - Will you need a blue-and-white escort ? - No . We can handle it . Good , I can 't spare one . I think he 's starting to warm up to us , you know , a little . I can 't ... It 's not ... Your uncle staying the weekend or just the night ? Yeah , he just arrived . This is actually the missing agent . It 's a little bit better than hologram or pixel , isn 't it ? - If you 're into that kind of thing . - Yeah , I 'm trying to scan it with your dingus . I can 't connect it with the ... - Hold on . May I ? Seriously . - Yeah , what ? Just do that , but go slower . All right , wow me with your 3-D . I don 't appreciate the tone , young man . A little speed would be good . People are actually dying . Yeah , go . - Nice . - Okay , this is what I 'm saying . He 's kind of cute for an old-timey guy . Welcome back to the Warehouse ... Jack Secord . Joined the marines in ' 48 , recruited to the Warehouse in ' 55 . Last known location , Minneapolis . That 's a long way from St. Louis , Louis . Here , put these on . Oh , what , are we going into surgery ? - Just do as you 're told , please . - Okay . Jack Secord ... living quarters , personal effects , sealed 6 / 22 / 62 . Holy bed-and-breakfast , Batman . This is Leena 's . No , this is the Warehouse , but , yes , it is room 5 of the bed-and-breakfast , but it 's still the Warehouse . See , whenever a Warehouse agent ... if he disappears , if he dies ... Listen to me . If he dies mysteriously , then , you know , living quarters , personal effects ... they 're collected and preserved here . So he smoked ... - a lot . - Hey , it was the ' 60s . Everybody smoked . - What 's this ? - What ? " I 'll be in town a few days . Until then ... " - Are there envelopes ? - No . So there 's no addresses ? No , maybe somebody was reading his mail . Well , it was the cold war . Probably somebody was reading his mail , but girlfriends weren 't against the rules ... Wait , girlfriends ? Yeah , it 's female writing , see ? You can still smell the perfume . So is that like an old-school booty call ? Yeah , before there was texting , grasshopper , there was a time when people actually did put pen to ... You know what ? That 's the ticket . Here . You know , it 's not what he got . It 's what he actually ... wrote . The indentations ... left behind ... Oh , sweet . Yeah , a product of a misspent youth . And that is ... - Who 's that ? - Rebecca . And where do you live , Rebecca ? - Is that " St. Louis " ? - Yeah . St. Louis , wow . What do you know , Jack Secord ? You actually did leave a note . Rad . Rebecca St. Clair ? I 'm agent Lattimer . This is agent Bering . We 're with the secret service . Oh , my . How can I help you ? Would you mind if we came inside ? Well , sure . Thank you . Ma 'am , we 're just in the middle of an investigation , and a body was found today . - A body ? - Yes . In the personal effects of the deceased was this address . Oh , my God . You found Jack . - So you knew him ? - Jack Secord , yes . I knew him quite well . - Where did you find him ? - Well , he was ... he was ... sealed up underground . We 're very sorry . Did he mention any strange occurrences before he went missing ? Jack didn 't talk about his work . Is this connected with that awful thing at the police station ? We 're really not at liberty to say , but if you have anything , if you know anything , no matter how seemingly insignificant , it would be very helpful . Some tea and cookies ? - No . - Yes , please . Yeah , ple ... I ... yeah , I just ... I love cookies . He does . - Let me put on a kettle . - Okay . Thank you . - What are you doing ? - Establishing a rapport , making her feel comfortable . I think she knows something . Is that a vibe , or your stomach ? I haven 't eaten since last night , okay ? Unbelievable . Oh , those ... they look great . Thank you . The tea will be here in a minute . I 'd just like to ask you ... when his body was found , - was there anything strange about ... - Agent Bering . They 're good cooking . What ? When ? What 's the address ? Thank you . - It happened again . - Same conditions ? I 'm sorry , ma 'am , but we 've gotta go . Thank you so much for everything . I 'm ... I 'm sorry . Just got to have a little ... - Pete , don 't take them all . - Okay , that ... that one is ... these ... Have more people been electrocuted ? Listen , we 're very sorry , but we really can 't talk about it . - Thank you . - Thank you . - Let go of me . - Take it easy . Don 't touch me , you stupid pig . Just don 't kill me . We 're not here to hurt you , okay ? We just wanna ask you a few questions . No , the cops that killed him are gonna kill me too . - What do you mean " like him " ? Like who ? - The killer guy . Are you saying a cop did this ? 5-0 walked straight up and started burning people . I was just over there . I don 't know . It was crazy . - Who 's this ? - It 's a witness , he says a cop did this . They never say that . He 's probably covering for a gang he wants to join . Hey , get the hell out of here . Look , have all of your officers checked in after the explosion ? But only Clark is out , the head of the gang unit . Why ? He needed to decompress . He lost his temper . So these bodies , these gang members fall under his jurisdiction ? Well , of course , but like I said , he 's on R R ... R R , right . Could we get his address ? We could use his expertise . Give me a second . So the volatile lead of the gang unit is on mandated leave . While gang members get mysteriously killed by what looks to be a cop . What do you think ... two plus two equals four ? Have you ever stopped by the office on your day off ? No , but I 'm sure you have . Sergeant Clark and I call it dedication . You hear that ? Look at that . Sergeant Clark , federal agents ! Open up ! One , two , three , go . - Oh , my God , what is that ? - Clark , no ! Come on . He went down here . There ! He 's dead . Help me . That thing ... it 's gone . Go ! Just tell me that Clark 's body is on the way to me right now . No , Powell took it . For God . You know , I just don 't have time to play bureaucracy games to get it back ! I sent you pictures that Claudia asked for . - Great pictures . - Got them . Look , there was something on his back , Artie , some kind of ... a nasty , metallic lobster-looking thingy , and it 's gone now . Okay , so maybe , you know , if we find out what that thingy was , then we can track where it went . And you say that it also leaves a body when the body dies , maybe . Okay , that 's a good start . Please , tell me you have something else . It looked like it was fused to his back . Hold it . I got an idea . We 'll do it right now . Now , come on , come on . Right . Right away , just do it . One , two , three . Go do your thing . Do your thing . All right , talk to me . It gave off arcs of electricity . It must be how he burned those people . - You got it ? - Yeah , yeah . All right . So the electricity ... did it emanate from Clark - or from the artifact ? - Both . Okay , you know what ? So that just ... eliminates our last possibility . All right , just did it have buttons ? Did it have wires ? - Did it have an antenna ? - Artie . Digital rendering shows Jack had something on his back too . Okay , just ... all right , can you guys hear me ? Okay , attached ... to the vertebra at T-2 , 4 , 7 , and 9 and accesses the spinal cord , I think . I can 't really tell . Listen to me . Jack Secord , when he died , did not just have this artifact . He had it ... on him . I mean , this thing was like some kind of a ... it 's like a parasite . Dude , Ripley 's believe it or not . Same markings on Clark 's back . All right , did you get that ? Clark 's back too . So what powers it , Artie ? I mean , it must be drawing electricity from somewhere to electrocute people the way it did . I 'll just add that to our already-huge list of questions . Thank you . All right , good-bye . What ? Why are you making that face ? What are you ... you got something ? Electrocution ... that 's the word Rebecca used , but we didn 't know it did that yet . We hadn 't figured it out . - I see more cookies in my future . - Of course you do . I don 't know what you 're talking about . You asked if there were any more electrocutions . What exactly did you mean by that ? I heard it on the news . No , it was never mentioned in the news . Ma 'am , you know more than you 're saying . Okay , let 's cut to the chase , shall we ? You didn 't come in from DC . The unexplained electrocutions raised a flag . You found Jack , and you finally figured out there was an artifact . You 're from South Dakota , right ? This artifact that Jack was hunting for before he disappeared , it 's active again . Am I correct ? You weren 't just his girlfriend . - You 're a Warehouse agent . - Welcome to the conversation . Come here . - This is it . - That 's definitely - a nasty lobster-looking thing . - And what is ... that 's electrocution , right ? What was that writing ? - This one . - Okay , see , this ... this writing ... is very ... old . I have no idea what that writing is . Well , you want me to , you know , scan it in , do my thing ? - You go , girl . - Don 't . Sorry . That 's wrong . You left before I could be certain you were Warehouse . I wanted to share this with you ... what I dug up back then , what I think Jack was following . There 'd been several unexplained deaths , burned bodies . It started at a museum shortly after an 11th-century exhibit passed through . I couldn 't find a connection , but Jack had vibes about these things ... very annoying . He must 've started to investigate , and then he just disappeared . I always knew if we didn 't quit , one of us , one day , would lose the other . But for Jack , the Warehouse was his first love . Till death do them part . I scoured the crime scenes , but I never found any answers . You never went back to the Warehouse ? I couldn 't do that . Changed my last name , just disappeared . I stayed in St. Louis , hoping to find him one day ... Maybe lost , confused . Eventually my life was here . Does this look familiar to you ? That 's what we saw on Clark 's back . That 's the device . That 's Jack 's handwriting . Jack knew what he was looking for . - Are you still using that old thing ? - Yeah , right ? Okay , can you see this ? This is what you 're looking for . It 's called " the Spine of the Saracen " . Okay , great . So it has a name ? - What is a Saracen ? - A Saracen 's a Turk . Listen , there 's a legend that during the first crusade , the Turks had this elite warrior cult , and these warriors were rumored to be unstoppable for some reason in the field of battle . What I 'm thinking is that the spine ... Can you see this ? The spine was specifically designed as a weapon for these warriors . 11th Century . It 's the same as the museum exhibit . - What exhibit ? - Well , we found pictures too . Something happened at a museum exhibit that Jack Secord stumbled on . Rebecca showed us this . So maybe this thing was sealed and it got out somehow . Okay , so if we find it , how can we stop it ? I 'm deciphering the text right now . It 's a little difficult , but I 'm trying . It 's the words under this drawing , and loosely translated , it says , " The spine requires a lifetime commitment " . Yeah , man , I had a girlfriend like that once . So this thing must get its power from somewhere , right ? So if we shut down its source , can we stop it ? Yeah , well , you know , when I figure it out , you know what ? You 'll be the second to know . So this spine , you know , it 's probably still at Clark 's apartment . So we should get there before somebody else finds it . Now , Jack was a very good agent , the best . You be careful . Yeah , we will . Okay , so the last time we saw Clark alive , he ran into this alley , so we should start here ? Well , unless you wanna look under the arch . Help ! - What is that ? - Help me ! Help me ! - Hold it ! Hold it ! - He 's trying to kill me ! - Bring the gun here . - I shot him . I shot him in the chest , and he just kept coming at me . Who are you talking about ? Okay , now would be a good time to take the shot . Okay , that didn 't work . No , but the good news is , we 've pissed him off . Okay , stop it ! We 're on your side ! Please help me . Please help me . What happened ? Is he ... He 's gone . He was my ex-husband . There was a restraining order , but I 've never seen him ... Wait . - It 's gone . - But how ? Ma 'am , get out of the area now . Now ! Do you see it ? Do you ? Look out ! Pete , what 's going ... - Pete , don 't move ! - I 'm okay . Just let me call Artie . - All right , just let me ... - No , stay away ! I don 't wanna hurt you . Are you okay ? - Where 's Pete ? - He 's not here . What happened ? The same thing that happened to Clark and Jack , it 's happening to Pete . I have to go find him . Hang on one second . You were knocked out . We need to call an ambulance . I 'm fine , okay ? Just excuse me . I have to go . The spine was designed for one thing . It turns a person into a killing machine . It 's a warrior-maker . It uses the body like a big battery , heightening and redirecting the host 's natural electrical impulses . Yeah , it 's like ancient PCP . It jacks up adrenaline and testosterone . So on a scale of 1 to 10 , you 're about a 25 . Until the battery is drained and the barbs retract , it lies dormant , waiting for the next nearest living host to latch onto . Artie , the spine is on Pete . Okay , where is he right now ? I don 't know . Just tell me that you can remove it . We will , we will . There 's a way . There 's always a way , Myka . Artie , listen to me , I can 't ... I will not lose another partner . Just the look in Pete 's eyes . Artie , he looked ... I 've never seen him so angry . That 's not Pete . That 's the artifact . It just ... it feeds on aggression . It makes you go after what you hate , right ? Clark went after the gangs , and the last victim went after his ex-wife . A warrior that 's been programmed to kill his enemies . Jack fought it . He fought his feelings long enough so that he could seal himself up and not hurt anyone . What are you saying , Myka ? You think ... Pete is gonna do exactly the same thing ? I don 't know . Artie , what do I do when I find him ? What have you got ? Tell me anything you 've got . Okay , hold up , so when this thing was built , electricity didn 't exist yet , right ? So it 'd zap people , but what would happen if it got zapped ? That 's what the bolt of lightning was in the picture that they found . Remember , Jack wrote " Hand of God " . Maybe that 's what shuts down the spine , a bolt of lightning . Overwhelming the spine 's receptors might make it automatically detach . That 's not bad . Just turn the Tesla 's power to full . No , Artie , look , we already tried that . All right , listen ... Find Pete . Your Tesla 's not strong enough , so you 'll have to find a powerful electrical source somehow , somewhere . He 's gonna take a bullet . - What ? - That 's what we 're trained to do . Every secret service agent will take the bullet for the president , for his country . That 's what Jack did . He sacrificed himself . That 's what Pete 's going to do now . No , because Pete ... Pete knows that the spine will just latch on to another person . Then he 's going to make sure . That 's what Jack did . Your partner , two of my men just saw him headed back to the station house . What ... Why would he ... - The generators . - He 's found his bolt of lightning . Stop . Get out ! Powell , wait ! Wait . Look , it channels anger . You have to go outside . Please , just go . It 's gonna be okay . Okay , Artie can fix this . The spine ... requires a lifetime commitment . You can 't help me . Yes , I can , okay ? - You just have to ... - No ! I can feel it . This thing is stronger than I am . I don 't think I can fight it much longer . Yes , you can . We can find a solution . We can lock you up until we find an answer . Like Jack ? Buried for all those years to have that thing come back to life ? No ! It 's gotta end here . I have to die . And I have to take the spine with me . You understand , right ? Take these ... and clamp them to the spine . I tried , but I ... I can 't reach . If I miss , I 'll just kill myself and it will attach to its next victim . Myka , you 've gotta do this . Pete , I can 't . Please ! Please . Listen to me . You will come back . Do you hear me ? You will . Do it . Come on . Damn it . Come on , Pete . Don 't leave . Come on , Pete . Come on ! Don 't leave ! Oh , God . Are you okay ? I 'm okay . Oh , God . - Man , this trip really killed me . - Could you stop that , please ? Seriously , I am totally dead . - Hey , I 'm surprised to see you alive . - Don 't encourage him . I have but one life to live for my ... No , wait . All right , you know how I felt when you were actually close to ... So when you ... - This is Rebecca . - Right . Right . This is quite an honor . - Hello , I 'm Artie . - Hello . I wanted to be 100 % certain that this thing would never again see the light of day . Absolutely . I can take care of that . Place hasn 't changed very much . I 'm working on that . Claudia Donovan . Warehouse 13 : next generation . Thank you very much , Claudia . Thanks . Thank you . So I was wondering , we could always use an extra pair of hands . Use ... that 's the perfect word . Like I said , this place hasn 't changed very much . And it never will . It hates to let go of anything . Thank you , but no thank you . I came here to complete Jack 's mission . Now I 'm going home . I understand . Oh , right . Rebecca , just ... there is one last thing that you might be interested in seeing . Just like he left it . His lucky lighter . Rebecca , there 's something in here in Jack 's desk that claudia found that obviously belongs to you , so ... " Rebecca and Jack ... together forever . " Yeah , I 'm gonna give you a minute here . I guess Jack chose you over the Warehouse after all . Get out of here ... while you have time , while you still have a life left to live . This place ... it 's like the ... the spine . It 'll use you up .

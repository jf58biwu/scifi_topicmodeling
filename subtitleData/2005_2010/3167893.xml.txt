He will help you in the final leg of your journey To save the O. Z. To the gray gale . To the emerald . How very clever , mother . Hey , pooch . You okay over there ? You 've just been antsy as a guild fighter since we left finaqua . I 'm ... Just nervous about being a man on the run , I suppose . Yeah , I hear you . The sky 's clear . Yeah . But I get this funny feeling that we 're being followed . What do you think ? Another mobat ? Didn 't you say it was probably just a random scout Who just stumbled across us ? Didn 't you say we should pretend it never happened ? You were sweating then , too . Let go of me ! Let go - I 'd shoot you in the heart if I thought you had one . Cain ... What are those ? Bread crumbs for Azkadellia . She had an inside man all along , didn 't she ? A spy . Tutor ? Your trail ends here . You don 't understand . I stopped dropping those a while back . Afraid you 'd get caught ? But you were family . I still am , Dg . I care more about you than anybody else in the whole wide world . Then why would you do that ? For the last ... 15 annuals , I 've been locked up in a dark hole . Azkadellia came to me . She offered me my freedom if I 'd track you . If I had said no , She would have killed me on the spot . So I figured , At least I could keep her off your back while you rediscover your magic . But if that were the truth , why did you drop those disks ? Why didn 't you let us get away clean ? You know as well as I do that would have never worked . She would have been on us quick as death . Now , look , you guys , Whether you like it or not , Those things bought us valuable time . Why didn 't you tell me sooner ? I swear , Dg , I was just about to . I think it 's time to put this dog down . No . We 're all looking for second chances . Toto , too . Thank you , Dg . It doesn 't mean that I trust you , But we 're almost at the realm , And you 're the only one Well , we can 't just let him walk . Maybe we could keep him on a short leash . That 's a good idea . If you really mean what you say , you won 't mind traveling with us as Tutor . One wrong move , and I 'll take you on a walk you don 't come back from . You hear me ? Yeah . Now that we know that Azkadellia had a spy , She 's a lot closer than we thought we 've got to pick it up a notch . Come on , let 's go . Come on . My mother and father planned all this from the beginning , didn 't they ? They know all about us , don 't they ? They knew , and they left you for dead . I on the other hand , will never leave you . Think ! Ahamo is a man weak of heart , blinded by emotion , nostalgic , sentimental . He was so happy here . That 's it . That 's it . There must be a trace we can follow . Dg 's not the only one who can remember , is she ? Remember . Focus . Dg ? Leave them here . He 'll find them when he comes back with mother . Do you think father will know they 're from us ? Well , he told us to make him something he could keep forever , and he taught us how to sculpt clay . What if they 're touched with our magic ? Good idea . Now he 'll definitely know . Come on . Daddy . You loved that sappy little token of your daughters 'love , didn 't you ? I bet you still have it with you , glowing bright as a beacon . Go find the glow . Find Ahamo . What ? Trust me , the realm of the unwanted is here . Somewhere . I think he 's found something . Come on . I 'm fine . Where 'd he go ? Over there ! Come on . Come on . Yeah . Well , that 's some you don 't see everyday . Careful , Dg , careful . Easy ... Yeah , come on , let 's go . Come on ... Come on , let 's go . Let 's go . Come on , come on . Glitch , come on ! Come on ! Cain , uh , help a zipperhead out with a memory or two . In this realm , who exactly are the unwanted ? Criminals , outlaws , and a few living experiments gone wrong .

But she wouldn 't be very proud of me right now , Though , being empty-headed enough to let her daughter walk right into a trap . Yeah , you and me both . Look ! Toto ! Hey , toto , come on , show these longcoats what you 're really made of . He just did . I believe you owe me something . A slow death or a quick one . Didn 't I capture three of the most wanted men in the zone ? What you did was stick your six greedy little hands into something far bigger than a bounty . Get rid of her . What ? No . No , zero , don 't do this . Give me my money . Zero ! Word from the Sorceress . We should return to the tower . At least I 'll have a souvenir to remember you by . Why don 't you unshackle me . I 'll teach you how to use it . You surprise me , cain . Not a lot of men make it out of the iron suit with their sense of humor intact . Let 's see how funny you are when you 're ... Hanging from the gallows in central city square . Let 's go ! Going somewhere ? What haou done with my friends ? Well , last I saw of them , they were putting up a good fight . Oh , so you only get a quarter of the bounty . I didn 't take you for the money . Oh ... Where I come from , freaks like you drive vans . Dg , you don 't understand , So just calm yourself . Calm myself ? I 'm not a kidnapper . Okay , so take me to my friends , seeker . I only call myself " seeker " so others in the realm Will come to me when they want to find Ahamo . What ? It was your mother 's idea . What do you know about my mother ? Well , I know you look just like her . You got your passion and your grit from her ... Your artistic ability from me . You 're my father ? Yes , Dg . The one your mother calls Ahamo . I have been dreaming of this day , of seeing you again . Okay , so you 've seen me , so ... Give me whatever it is my mother sent me for , And I 'll be leaving your , uh , teepee . Like it or not , Dg , I 'm your father . No , no , I had a real father .

' s only hope , Now , your friends understand how important this mission is . Help me turn it over . Get this out of our way . Sorry . Now ! Would you and your troops like a drink of water ? Father ... Son . It just keeps spinning . Maybe you 're just trying too hard . Clear your mind . Remember how it felt when you were a little girl , How the light flowed through you . Just concentrate , Deeg . Hey , did you see that ? Hey ... Hurry . Here , let me help you . Help me lift him off the cart . Grab the other side . Fetch some bandages . On three ... This way . Move ! What 's that doing here ? I keep it to remind me . To remind everyone . What we 're fighting for . You know , i , uh ... I thought you were dead . They told mother and I you were dead . If I knew you were still alive , I would have risked everything , Crossed enemy lines to come get you . You know that , don 't you ? Yeah , I do . Excuse me , sir . Sergeant is asking for you . Sir ? You , uh ... It just worked out like that . I 'm proud of you , son . Hey ... You all right ? Sure . When I took off from the nebraska state fair , I got caught in a freak storm And somehow slipped over to this side . It was a rough crossing , But when the clouds cleared , I was hovering over this crystal blue lake , And the most beautiful woman I 'd ever seen . My mother ? From that day on , I was hers . We married , two beautiful daughters . The perfect life . Until I messed it all up Letting the old witch escape . Your mother and I would given anything to keep that memory hidden from you . No . I have to know . Well , when your sister ... Killed you , When your mother gave you second life , We both knew something drastic had to be done , Both for the O. Z. and for you . That 's why I took you to the other side , Brought you to that tiny farmhouse . Why didn 't u stay ? Well , my job was here , To protect the secret of the emerald and prepare for u return . ? you and my mother could never be together ? There ! Azkadellia shield his mind . Raw cannot see . I 'll make this easy for you If you tell us everything you know about the machine . Bring it in . What do you got there ? What-what is that ? What , uh ... What , um ... Uh , what ... Are you , um ... O - okay , um ... Hold his fingers . No ... No ! No , wait , wait ! Wait , wait , wait ! No , not the fingers , not the ... Not the fingers - shut up ! I 'll tell you anything you want to know ! Oh , it 's too late . I 'll talk , okay ? - It 's too late ! Son ... Let him talk . Talk . The machine forms an intense beam of light . Why ? It focuses the power of the emerald at the double eclipse . Locks the two suns behind the moon . It 'll bring darkness to the O. Z. forever . Damn thing 's the anti-Sunseeder . Sunseeder ? Yeah , it 's a little doe I designed To slow the suns and extend the growing season . How do we shut it down ? - Ask him . Well , it soun wh 'sat she using it for is an entirely different barrel of monkeybats . I don 't know how her machine works . Part of you does ... Ambrose . - Ambrose ? Jeb ? Our spies found out " ambrose " is the code word for the brain that runs the machine . My marbe in the tower ? - Where are they ? Brain room . - Brain room , sub-level three . Look , i ... I 've told yourything that you need to know . Can you just ... Put that thing away . Just , put the thing away , okay ? Can you just ... Glad to . Jeb , what are you doing ? Job 's not done yet . Now we can finally finish this . Not like this . Put it away . This is the guy that killed mother . He destroyed your life and mine , and you want to let him live ? He deserves to die . - Yeah ! I won 't deny that , then what killiim won 'g back your mother ... And it won 't honor her memory either . I think that means we 're here . But i don 't see anything . Your mother told me about this place , but i never dreamed it would be so beautiful . Who 's buried here ? The ones whose blood runs through your veins , a royal succession that lead to you . And the oldest rests here . She was your greatest great grandmother . The original slipper . First to make it through to the O. Z. From the other side . Dorothy gale . You were named in her honor . The emerald is guarded by the gray gale . This you must do alone . I 've been waiting for you . You 're dorothy ? The emerald of the eclipse is in your hands now . Come on . Adora ! Adora ! No ! It won 't be long until the eclipse . We have to hurry . Dg , you are everything i had hoped you 'd be . I am so proud of you . " i 'm so proud of you . " my little girl . You 're everything i hoped you 'd be . " daddy ... You old romantic . - No ! Daddy ... I have missed you so much . What did you do to him ? He 's quite comfortable . You have something for me . Come on . You want to share your shiny new trinket with your big sister ? No ... You 're not my sister . It doesn 't look like much , does it ? But it has so much power . Green 's not your colour . I thought you were dead , little sister . Buried in the ground all these years . - You 're a ... No . It 's where you belonged . You look good in marble . Green marble . Make camp . We leave in an hour . What did you do ? If we stop azkadellia , we 'll be back for him in a few days . If not , he 'll be there a long time . I hope that 's justice enough for you . It 's not my first choice , but mother would approve . If you don 't have heart ... You have nothing . Oh , who am i kidding , this is all my fault . If i hadn 't thought of my machine in the first place , she never would have been able to twist it . Yeah . I 'm scared . I don 't know what to do . Are you sure you trying to find dg is the right thing ? She 's alive , i know she is . Someone in the realm has to know how to find the seeker . Dg is the key to bringing the witch down . Well , gods willing , i 'll see you at the tower then . Thank you . Okay , let 's move it , men . We don 't have much time . Don 't you look pretty . Good thing , ' cause i brought you a date . Is it really you ? I have dreamed of this day . Oh , i love you . Enough . Do you know how long i have waited to see that look on your face ? No phony smile , no brave front , just pure and utter shock . It may be the most honest gift you 've ever given me , mother . I am not your mother . Our daughter is really gone ? Both of your daughters are gone . Dg is dead ? Your little girl 's quest has ended as your royal line ends today , in darkness . Permanent darkness . Toto ! I can take you to dg . I know where she is . She 's in trouble . Clear your mind . Remember how it felt when you were a little girl . How the light flowed through you . Concentrate , dg . Show me how she spins without touching it . You okay ? Dg ... Do you have the emerald ? Where is it ? She 's got it , cain . Okay , let 's go . Of course . Why would it be easy ? Well , if you guys can blow the generators that power those turbines , we can sneak in the same way we escaped . I 'll send my best men down to lay charges . Kind of boggles the noggin to think we 're going in there with all guns blazing . Well , let 's hope we 're the quiet part of this plan . We 're almost ready . - Have you guys seen raw ? I , uh , think he 's lost his nerve . Hey , raw , i wanted to show you something . That 's bad , right ? I mean ... You lost the emerald , so ... W - what does that mean ? It means ... That i don 't need it anymore . All that i need is right here . Raw ... You are no coward . You have taught me that courage is not about being fearless , it 's about standing up in spite of your fear , and you stood up to the papays , you threw yourself off a cliff , you escaped from prison . Raw do that for dg . No . You did that for you . Courage has been in you all along . You know , when i had a brain , i was twice as scared as i am now with only half a brain , which means that if i had no brain at all , i would be four times braver than i was when i was brainy . Glitch ... You 're the smartest guy i know . No , you 're just saying that to make me feel good . You helped me remember my past , and that 's probably the most important weapon i have now . Thank you . I know what you 're doing , kid . I 've led men through battle myself . And , um , how am i doing ? There 's less hugging when i do it ... But not so bad . We better get going - look ... You may not be able to save your sister . So if our plan doesn 't work , you will try to get out of there ... Right ? This is the one time that i 'm not going to be there to help . You 've already helped me , mr . Cain . I 'm serious . Don 't go up there and lose you head , and ... Forget about what 's really important . What 's really important is family . I can 't remember who taught me that . Good luck , mr . Cain . I want no interruptions once it begins . After 500 years , i want this moment to be ... Perfect . Forward light pulse is at 100 % . All we need now is power . The west wall , quickly ! Move , move , move ! The resistance is giving me a fireworks display . You three with me . - Yes , sir ! Let it begin . What is it ? - Intruders . We 're doubling the guard . This way ! Let 's go . Raw , which way ? Up one floor . All right , let 's do it . Good luck . I thought you hightailed it . Go . I 'll watch out . Go . Hey , look . I 'd recognize me anywhere . Glitch ... - Hmm ? It 's time to get reacquainted with yourself . Connect him to it . All right , glitch , i need you to remember something for me . Glitch , can you hear me ? My name isn 't glitch . It 's ambrose . Okay , ambrose . I need you to remember how you designed the sunseeder , and how to shut it down . Do you see the keyboard numbers that control the light pulsing ? Yeah , about a million of them . Which ones do i turn off ? Proper shut-down sequencing to reverse light pulsing is imperative - okay , which numbers ? What 's causing the problem ? Power surging in the brain cortex . Some kind of synapse interference . Get kalm . You two , come with me . Azkadellia ! There 's still time to stop this ! Look up ! The power of the emerald is about to lock the eclipse in the sky and bring permanent darkness to the O. Z. A fierce new world is awakening . No ! Listen to me , my sister ! This is not what you want ! Remember who you are ! Your sister is dead . No . Ah , good . I think it 's working . Why are we losing power ? And the last number to reverse light pulsing ... Yeah . One more , and it will be your last . No ! Don 't fire your weapon in here ! Kalm , tell me what they did and how to fix it . Now ! Turn on ... 1666 ... 14 ... 2025 - shut him up ! One more number , kalm . I can 't find it ! I need the final number for full power ! Ah , good . Finally ... Permanent darkness . two little princesses dancing in a row spinning fast and freely on their little toes where the light will take you no one ever knows ... do you remember that time at the cave when you remembered what all those symbols meant ? You were so smart . It 's the picture language of the ancients ... " your adventures have a way of getting me into trouble , " that 's what you said . You said " you veadntures have a of getting me into trouble . Do you rememberpinning do how we made it fly together ? " concentrate ... " just concentrate , deeg . And do you remember the bear ? How scary it was , and you stood up . You were so brave , it made me brave . Just hold my hand , deeg ! Nothing can hurt us if we stay together ! Hold my hand . Nothing can hurt us if we 're together . Take it . Take it ! Take my hand . I 'm sorry i let go , az . I 'm scared . I 'm here , and i 'll never run away again . Take my hand . You 're talking into the wind , girl . Take my hand . Not now ! Take my hand . Have the little bitch . I care not . For the heavens do my bidding ! The emerald ... Give me the emerald . Give me the emerald ! Hold on . I 'm not going anywhere . Leave him alone ! You never understood . All you people need is encouragement . Raw just need courage . Glitch ... Wake up . Come on , glitch , wake up . Hello . Do i know you ? Good morning , sweetheart . - Cain ! We need that last number to reverse the beam . Now , think . The number , ambrose . The number ! Is it my locker combination ? Come on ! My parents ' anniversary ? I can 't think ! I won 't let go . You can do this . I can 't think . - Feel . I - i can 't ... I can 't think . I know what to do . Hold on . If we can 't reverse the number , i 've got to shut it down . I 'm sorry , ambrose . No , no , wait ! Wait ... 1208 ! The queen 's birthday , of course . Commence the reverse pulsing ! She melted . My azkadellia ? - Mother ... Oh , is it really you ? The witch is gone . It 's over . Dg ! I thought i 'd never see you again . Welcome home . Thank you . That 's the O. Z. I remember . I 'm so glad to be home .

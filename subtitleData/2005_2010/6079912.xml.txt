 'It had been thirty years since my mother was killed by a triffid . 'She was trying to understand them . I 've been doing the same ever since . ' Hello . I 'm Jo Playton coming to you from the heart of London . Why do triffids always go for the eyes ? Argh ! Dr Kotch , it 's me , Bill Masen . What 's happening ? 'This is an emergency broadcast from the BBC . 'Most of the people in the world have been struck blind . There is no government . ' These people have every right to live ! Over their heads . I 'm Torrence . Hear there was a bit of panic about triffids . Triffids are carnivorous plants that can move . Their most abundant source of food is us . I 've got to get to my father 's place in Shirning if we 're going to work out how to deal with them . No ! You 've got to get to Shirning , with or without me . Masen , you 're under arrest ! Agh ! Being taken up to the Heath . It 's all Torrence . He 's running the show . It was a vicious attack . He 's dead , Jo . Where d 'you think you 're going , boys ? Stay where you are ! Don 't move ! Ain 't going to tell you again . TRIFFID RECORDING PLAYS What have got in your hands , Masen ? Show me your hands ! Show me ! Argh ! Argh ! Masen , you ... Argh ! Argh ! Argh ! Let 's go ! ENGINE SPLUTTERS ENGINE REVS Oh ! Oh ! Ah ! The triffids , they are coming . ENGINE SPLUTTERS Bill ... Bill , wake up . The engine 's had it . The weather 's getting worse . We 'll have to walk . Try and find some shelter . At least the snow will slow them down . Triffids have been engineered to survive in any weather . This is Radio Britain calling to you live from London . Calling all citizens - men , women and children . If you are sighted , help the blind . Come to London . Here you 'll find safety , food and shelter . Gathering points have been set up around the M25 . Make your way there and you 'll be safe . I 'm Jo Playton . And you are not alone . Need some help . Are there any others ? Oh , no . Shut the gates . Where is he ? Lead me to him . Here , he 's been shot in the shoulder . Thank you , Father Thomas . I 'll clean the wound and close it , then you 'll need serious rest . You 're lucky your friend brought you here . I was lucky I found you . I don 't believe in luck . Mother Superior . You were meant to come here , meant to be cured . Body and soul . I hope you will stay . Here , we are all equal . Ah ! When you 're better , you 'll see clearly . London will seem like another world . Who 's in charge in London ? We don 't get any news . There 's no London now , Father Thomas . There 's only us . 'If I was going to make it to Shirning , I had to stop , regain my strength . 'But I knew the triffids would never rest . 'They would continue to hunt us down , find populated places , march towards London . Towards Jo . ' Are we winning ? Yes . So my messages are getting through ? Absolutely . More every day . Let me explain . The blue areas , right , we control . The red areas , we defend . Green is triffids . That 's an awful lot of green . It 's still the safest place in the country . The important thing is that we survive . You 're still here . I 'm still here . Yeah , I wish Bill was . He could have helped us . Yeah , well , Bill 's dead , all right ? And you say that Major Coker 's too busy running the country ? I mean , what 's his plan ? The broadcasts were his idea , after all . Well , to be honest , Major Coker 's struggling . It 's people like you and me that are keeping things going . I mean , you have done brilliantly . You 're bringing them in . That 's what they say , " I heard Jo on the radio . " I heard her voice , that 's why I came . " Have dinner with me . Dinner ? Yeah . Just ... just the two of us . As if everything was just normal ? It 's the way you survive - by insisting everything 's normal . By refusing to give in . Sheer force of will . That 's why they follow me - they know I 'll never give in . Follow YOU ? Just because the whole world 's gone crazy doesn 't mean we can 't have a little bit of fun . Oh , well , you know what ? That is really sweet of you . Maybe next time . OK ? OK . How long have they been there ? At least as long as we have . I don 't understand . Why aren 't they hunting ? Food must be getting scarce and there 's so much of it in the abbey . Yeah , I asked her about that and she said ... She ? Durrant . She 's the Mother Superior . She 's in charge here . I want to see her . Go with peace in your heart , dear Father Thomas . Father , come along . It 's always sad when first-class people have to go . But he wanted to spread the word . Father Thomas will find more survivors , he will begin a new community and build on what we 've done here . Well , he 's a brave man . You 're looking much better , Dr Masen . I 'm much stronger , thanks . Major Coker tells me you 're a triffid expert . Well ... Yes . The triffids , out there in the country , were they always so passive ? First , they were quite troublesome . I lost many friends . But then God intervened . Really ? How did God do that ? He answered our prayers . When the peaceful nature of our community became clear , the triffids returned to the wood and killed no more . Do you know , I 've been amongst triffids all my life . I 've never known them to behave like that . We strive to live in harmony with nature . We intend no harm . They seem content with that . I was in your cellar . You know you have a generator down there ? I could get it going for you . Get you proper lighting , heating ... No . I don 't think so . But it would make things easier . Come . Look , look , look , look . Look at that tower . Men built that tower long before there was electricity or power tools . It wasn 't easy , but it stands . I don 't want things to be easy . I want them to be right . BUZZING What are you doing ? Leaving to go to my father 's . I need some help with the triffids . But they 're quiet here . You heard what she said . She may be a little eccentric , but if she 's figured out a way to co-exist with them ... By being " peaceful " ? We 've both seen what the triffids can do . Look , Coker , they 've got over fifty beehives out there . All it takes is warmer weather , then the triffids will be pollinated . Then they 'll spore and we 'll have hundreds and thousands of new plants . Durrant and the rest of the world won 't stand a chance . If we don 't find a way to defeat the triffids , the human race will become extinct . I 've marked the safe path through the woods . And , God willing , it 's only a mile , you 'll get there safe , find a vehicle . Thank you . They 're building a wall to keep the triffids out . Torrence 's idea . But they all fight for Major Coker . Torrence gives the orders . Torrence seems to have an awful lot on his plate at the moment . I mean , why isn 't Osman helping ? I haven 't seen that little creep in a while . He got what he deserved . We found bits of him up on the Heath after the triffid attack . Never nothing of the other two . Nothing ? Coker was all right . Didn 't know the other bloke . So they really found nothing of the other two ? Just what Torrence has got in that red box . Some bust-up old MP3 player . Oh , Troy , is Bill Masen alive ? Is he ? I don 't know , but Torrence thinks he might be . Come on ! Come on ! Move it ! Agh ! Agh ! APPROACHING VOICES Time for your broadcast , miss . OK . Thanks . Let 's go . ♪ .. He leadeth me ♪ The quiet waters by . ♪ Join me in giving thanks and praise to Peggy , who has been chosen ... .. like Father Thomas and the others , to go out and build new communities . Dr Masen , please ... welcome , be seated . I know all about your new communities . I found Father Thomas 's body in the woods . CONGREGATION GASPS Tied . Sacrificed . Dr Masen , do you know anything about beekeeping ? The beehive is a symbol of the perfect harmonious society . Each bee has its appropriate place , its own task . And when the task is done , the bee is replaced , quickly and efficiently . The hive acts as one , always for the good of the hive . Not for the good of the queen ? Father Thomas was old . He could do nothing more for our little community . We cannot accommodate everyone who finds their way to our door . We have to prioritise . We have to make room . By feeding the surplus to the triffids ? The triffids are also God 's creatures . I did what God wanted me to do . What he TOLD me to do . CONGREGATION GASPS Outside these walls is chaos . Here , everything is customary , ceremonial , safe . As long as you do exactly as she says . As long as you abandon the weak and the helpless ! Believe me , everyone of you here will die before she does . I control the triffids . Without me , you 'll all be overrun . No-one has the right to choose who lives and who dies . Stop them ! Let him go . Let him go . You ... These people trusted you and you betrayed them . If you defy me , you will be damned ! Three , two , one ... Hello , again , whoever you are , wherever you are . I hope you can hear me . You can always stay . Work with us , as an equal . You think it 's going to be easy without me . I don 't think they want it to be easy . They want it to be right . The triffids know me . This community will not survive . I was thinking today about missed opportunities . We 're taking over London ! 'Did you ever know the right thing to do and then you hesitated ? ' And then it was too late . 'And do you long for that chance again ? 'Except yearning won 't make it happen . ' To keep you company so you know Jo is safe and well . 'Sometimes you have to act . 'Sometimes you have to make that chance happen again . ' This is Jo Playton , Radio Britain . Miss ? Now , you take care . Come back soon , yeah ? Yeah . Thank you . I heard your latest broadcast . Who were you talking to ? My father . But he 's dead , isn 't he ? Oh , not to me , he isn 't . For a minute there , I thought you were talking to me . I was thinking about my dad and how I missed the opportunity to be with him . How I don 't want to make the same mistake with you . What are you trying to tell me , Jo ? That I 've changed my mind . I want to have dinner with you . You 're just saying that cos you 're scared . Well , I am scared , but I know that you 'll protect me . Better than anyone . Better than Major Coker . I know he 's supposed to be running the country , but as far as I can see , you 're doing it all for him . And I have been ever since he died . Huh ? Triffid attack . Why didn 't you tell me ? I didn 't want to give you any more bad news . You see , I 've been protecting you longer than you know . So you 're the one that 's in charge now . It 's a new world , Jo , you know ? We can be anything we want , can do anything we want . Look at us . Look where we are . So , dinner ? Yes . When ? Tonight . After my broadcast . 'I forced myself on . 'The pollination of the triffids was inevitable . 'Once they spored , any hope of defeating them would be lost . 'Time was my greatest enemy .

As long as you 're prepared to die . 'Because that 's what you 're going to have to do - be prepared to fight and die , 'so that this so-called government can live in luxury and pretend that it is not losing the war ... ' Jo , what are you doing ? So , don 't come to London , the triffids are here , too . If you 've survived this far , 'don 't come to the centre . The voice of Britain is a lie . 'I am Jo Playton , but I am not the voice of Britain . 'The voice of Britain is you , wherever you are . ' What is going on ? I told her , but she won 't stop ... 'If you 've survived this far , don 't come to the centre , don 't listen to me ... ' I told you to watch her . I ... I saw her start . She was here . But she 's not here now . FIND HER ! Troy !

Where are your parents ? We don 't want to talk about it . I 'm going to this house that I know , which I hope will be safe . But , listen , I need a car . Have you any idea where I can get one ? If we help you , you help us . Yeah . Fine . Thanks . I can 't see the name . Shirning ? Well , I think it 's in a very secluded spot . It 's probably not even marked . " Probably " ? STATIC ON RADIO I haven 't actually been there myself . Who lives there , then ? My father . Stay in the car . Stay in the car . Put it down . Dennis . Hello , son . There ... Shirning . So ... you 're here because of the triffids . Aye . And no doubt you want my research , so you can try and stop them . Come back from there ! Be very , very careful . Is he really your father ? Yeah . He 's scary . I heard that . 'Calling woman and child . This is the voice of Britain . 'Come to London and lay your burdens down . 'Here there is safety , food and shelter ...

And to look after him . Thank you for bringing him home . I was ... Well , I thought that you were ... Come along , girls . It is so good to see you . And these belong to you . My triffid recordings . How did you get this ? From Torrence . How did those girls survive ? Maybe they were too small and the triffids had easier prey . I don 't know . I promised to look after them . Just them ?

It 's not good news , sir . The latest triffid reports from the front . Go ... away . Huh ! So ? So , this is what you do with your retirement . Keep busy . When you devote your life to studying triffids , they tend to take over . But it does have its compensations . Here is how we stop the triffids . Create an entirely new triffid ? ! One which would generate pollen that sterilises rather than fertilises . We extract pollen from the male specimen , modify it , fertilise the young female triffid with it . She produces spores with the infertile strain . Simple . Elegant . With the same genetic fix that got us in this mess ? There are always unintended consequences , Bill , to everything we do . Sooner or later someone has got to deal with them and make sense of what happened . You remind me of your mother . She was the genuine article , the real thing . A brilliant scientist , interested only in knowledge for its own sake . Me ? My motivation was a wee bit more practical . I 've had this same picture with me for as long as I can remember . When that picture was taken , the future looked very bright for all three of us - the world even . Yeah . Now look at it . Mother Nature is finally taking her revenge and reclaiming the planet . No-one intended this . And now , given the consequences and the price that we both paid ... .. do you think it was it worth it ? Do you ? I can understand why you feel so angry . Angry ? I was a wee boy , my mum had just died and my dad ... My dad , he just didn 't seem to notice me . Too busy saving the world . No , no , no . No , you 're right . I never made time for you . I didn 't know how . Well , you were so young and I did try , but ... Without your mum ... Erm ... These triffids are going to start sporing any day now . How far have you got with your plans ? I 've got everything we need . Except a male . I 've been hunting for one in and out of the old triffid facility , but as of yet , no luck . I 'll get you a male triffid . BURSTS OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE Good shooting . Reload . I need the practice . You don 't need your mask . Yes , I do . And you should , too . Mum and Dad don 't . They 're not Mum and Dad . They 're Jo and Bill . Well , they 're Mum and Dad to me . TRIFFID HISS So that 's his plan and you 're going along with it ? We have to try something , before it 's too late . Great . We spent our lives trying to avoid the triffids , then end up back in a place that 's going to grow them . Did you consider me and the girls when you thought of sacrificing yourself ? If you 've got a better idea , I 'd like to hear it . I suppose Dennis could could go , but last time he went out looking , he came back with you . I will come back . I promise . The clutch sticks a bit . Don 't go over 50 . And I would like it back exactly as it is . Susan ? 'I didn 't agree with my father 's plan , 'but I wasn 't doing it for him . 'I was doing it for Jo and the girls 'and for the rest of the world . ' You 've just got to understand ... MUSIC DROWNS OUT SPEECH Hello ? Come . Whoa ! That smells terrible . Well , she needs to build her strength up , if she 's going to save mankind . TRIFFID RECORDING PLAYS Agh ! Susan ! TRIFFID HISSES What are you doing here ? I 'm here to help . Don 't worry . I can take care of myself . Yeah , I 've noticed . Susan ! Argh ! Bill ! Bill ! Bill ! Bill ! Agh ! Help ! Help ! Aaaaargh ! Aaargh ! No ! Aaargh ! Urgh ! TRIFFID SCREAMS You OK ? You got it . We got it . Here , come . CAR HORN TOOTS Well ? Oh ! Did you get it ? One male triffid head . You 're in a lot of trouble with Mum . Oh , no ! Just don 't do it again . You did well , son . How did you do it ? With this . It 's got triffid sounds from the farm on it . I have a theory that different sounds provoke different emotions . And the proof ? I tried to identify the obvious emotions like fear and hunger , but they 're so complex and I 've barely scratched the surface . Your mother was of the same opinion . Her biggest fear was that we 'd exploit the triffids without understanding them . I couldn 't persuade her to leave Zaire . It was more than just oil for her . She recognized some indications of sensibility . They could communicate with each other . She was convinced that if we didn 't understand them thoroughly ... we might live to regret it . She wouldn 't let go . She just kept pushing and pushing , and in the end ... she got too close . I miss her , too . Yes . You know , I ... I always ... wanted to give you these . I never had the opportunity ... or the words . From Zaire . Your mother 's recordings of triffids . Thanks . You know what ? Once we 've fertilized the female maybe we can work on them together . Right . Maybe together we could crack it . Ah . It 's happening . 'The triffids are sporing . ' You knew this was going to happen ? Not like this . Nothing like this . What did you find ? Got that from one of the farms . Good boy , Troy . That 'll be all . AIRCRAFT ENGINE HUMS Jo ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! What 's it say ? There 's people on the Isle of Wight . There 's more than 200 of them . And they want people to join them . They 've got families , doctors , schools . Where there 's life , there 's hope . At least we have somewhere safe to go once we release the new breed of triffids . Oh , talking of which , feeding time . I 'll be up in a minute . This is good . This is very good ! This is very good ! Patience , little one . Patience . 'This is Dr Ruth Masen . 'It 's the 16th of September , 11am . 'We 're one mile outside base camp by the Kasai River basin . 'This is triffid recording number 0050 . ' TRIFFID HISSES ON TAPE Agh ! Agh ... Argh ! Bill ! Bill ! BILL ! Bill ! Bill ! Bill ! Bill ! The tape ! The tape ! Turn off the tape ! Dad ? ! Get the tape ! Agh ! No ! No ! Don 't kill it ! Don 't ... ! Agh ! Oh , no ! Argh ! I 'm sorry , Bill . Oh , no ... ! Oh , sorry , Bill . No ! No ! Your mother was ... your mother , she was right . No . I 'm so sorry , Bill . Stay still . Don 't talk . TRIFFID HISSES That recording 's from a triffid in Africa . It wasn 't genetically modified . So that could be the reason that the one your dad grew reacted to the sound . Perhaps it thought it was under attack . I don 't know . Can you start again ? No time . There 's never enough time ! We can stay here a little longer ... if you want to . There 's nothing here for us now . We 'll leave for the Isle of Wight first thing in the morning . Hello ? 'Hello again . 'Whoever you are , wherever you are , 'I hope you can hear me . 'I was thinking today about missed opportunities ... ' Bill . Hmm ? What is that ? What ? Something 's wrong . The radio 's on . Come on . ' .. maybe out of fear . 'Do you long for that chance again ? 'Except yearning won 't make it ha ... ' Imogen , where 's Susan ? What 's wrong ? Nothing 's wrong . Hello , Jo ... If you hurt her ... ! No ! Cute child . Get away from her . As you can see , I 've come with friends . Where 's Susan ? Where is she ? Susan ? Um ... All tied up . She wouldn 't co-operate . I want you to take her , put her with the sister and watch her . Well , good to see you , too , Jo ! Triffids too much for you , were they , Torrence ? Huh ? We had terrible trouble with the triffids . They started using the underground tunnels and sewers . Not very sporting . But now , now you 're going to help us , Bill . Good job you didn 't die , huh ? So what do we do , eh ? How do we stop the triffids ? I don 't know . Well , that is very disappointing ! Cos I was relying on you . I said to Troy there , " Troy , you know who we need to help us with the triffids ? " It 's Dr Bill Masen . " You 'd better put your thinking cap on . It 's too late . They 've already spored . We either fight them or we give up . Or we could go to the Isle of Wight . I found a message from Major Coker . Why would you want to go to the Isle of Wight ? You need the triffids . Oh , do I , Jo ? Yes , you do , because they made you . I mean , without them , you 're nothing . You 're nothing but a jumped-up little ... ! You shut ... ! Don 't touch her ! Don 't you touch her ! OK , finger off the trigger . Stay of execution . You 've got until tomorrow morning to come up with SOMETHING ! Something to get us all safely out of here and down to the coast ! You do that , that 'll be great . If you fail , I take Jo , kill you , I give the girls to the triffids . Is it a plan ? OK . OK . Yeah . Excellent . OK . Lock them up . CCTV and controls for the electric gates if the triffids attack . The old man really had this place triffid-proof , huh ? Bring Masen to me . The solution to the triffids is in my mother 's recordings . It has to be . If we can ... use the sounds to communicate with them ... somehow , then maybe we can control them . We 've only got until tomorrow morning . And the noise of those men will bring the triffids . Well , we have to escape . We 've done it before and we will do it again . Torrence is not going to make the same mistake twice . We have a much better chance against the triffids than against Torrence . Triffids . What , Bill ? The triffids could be the answer . How ? We use my triffids recordings . We draw them in en masse as a distraction so we can get out . Bill , it 's a brilliant idea , but how are we going to get out surrounded by hundreds of triffids ? They 'll kill us all ! It 'll be all right . It 'll cause confusion , then maybe , maybe it 'll give us a chance to escape . Mr Torrence wants to see you . OK . It 's all right . I was upstairs in the laboratory . Looks like you had a bit of a problem . Dad not make it ? Is this your mum ? She 's foxy . How 's your plan getting on ? You 'll let me know when you come up with a solution ? You 've got till dawn . Otherwise I reunite you with Mummy and Daddy . It 's OK . Where 's the device ? I did it . I put it outside . TRIFFID RECORDING PLAYS TRIFFIDS CLICK Triffids . Triffids ! TRIFFIDS ! They 're everywhere ! Found this . Hold that . Bill , what have you gone and done ? Troy , shoot Masen . No ! Damn . Shoot the girls . Go now . And be ready to put the electric fence on full power . My command . They 're everywhere . I 've got orders to shoot the girls . Troy , this isn 't you . Stop it . There 's no way Torrence can get past the triffids . We 're leaving . Come with us . BURST OF GUNFIRE Fire now ! Are you done ? Yeah , I 'm done . ( OK . ) Troy ? 'Is everything OK ? ' Sir . OK .

We 're making a run for it , Torrence . I mean , look , they 're everywhere . I know . They 'll kill us all . Except you . I 'm going to kill you . Why don 't you come with us ? Huh ? What , me ? But I 'm just a " jumped-up nobody " . Torrence , come on . If anyone can get us through an army of triffids , Torrence , it 's you . Nice try , Jo . Come on ! Come on ! Get the door ! Get the door ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! We 'll never make it ! There are too many of them ! We have to try ! No , Bill ! They 're already in the courtyard ! Aaaargh ! OK , does everyone have goggles ?

'The sea was our wall against the triffids . 'We cleaned the isle of them and our community started to grow again . 'Future generations will ask how it happened . 'How did the world get swallowed up so quickly ? 'It was because we had our eyes closed . 'Even when we could see . ' Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail subtitling @ bbc.co.uk

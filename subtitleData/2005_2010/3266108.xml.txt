Fade away . eventually . I 'm thinking sooner rather than later . et cetera . Follow-up letter to dr . Prender 's article on ptsd . Alludes to litigation involving dr . Prender . Lucas vs.Prender. Evelyn prender was the defendant ... psychiatric malpractice . how it works . found a publisher . We never have as much time as we think . I wanted to ask you about a lawsuit . Your wife was a defendant . Lucas vs.Prender ? Yes . A patient 's family sued her for malpractice . - You 've heard of recovered memory ? - Yeah . that lawsuit helped evelyn realize how terribly mistaken she 'd been . That 's when she started working with veterans . I suppose . is the opposite of recovered memory . as opposed to the ones you can 't remember . before we met . I--I don 't really know the details . it wasn 't something she liked to talk about . Who would know ? what can you tell us about the lawsuit ? Evelyn and I were partners when the lucas family sued her . Susan lucas was one of dr . Prender 's recovered memory patients . I was always very fond of evelyn . But ... I can 't forgive her . Why is that ? but she actually recanted . Recanted ? urged them to return to their families . The perpetrators . The cause of their misery . very damaging . that her father never abused her ? She became my patient . We 'd like to speak with her . Give me your number . I 'll pass it along . I 'm sure she will . And you and dr . Prender ? amicably . Do you still practice recovered memory ? I can 't abandon my patients . Some of them have been with me for years . Shouldn 't they be getting better by now ? the root causes primal . that susan lucas ' father did abuse her ? I have never doubted that for a moment . There 's no greater crime ... than for a parent to do that to a child . how old was susan when she became dr . Prender 's patient ? That 's when everything changed . That 's when the whole world turned upside down . work . Maybe I should talk to somebody . Sure . Whatever you want . I 'll pay for it . you 're accused of being a child molester . Your whole life is in shambles . convinces your precious child that you committed unspeakable acts . You sued dr . Prender . We had to do something . said we had no standing . Her own family . We couldn 't sue the doctor that destroyed everything we had . though . The lawyers didn 't give us a refund . We 'd like to talk to your daughter . So would I. She hasn 't spoken to us in 10 years . Have a nice day . Angry guy . except for the fact we already have a suspect in custody . Why are we doing this ? You already got wilcox to confess . Staff sergeant harold wilcox- - the guy was a hero . Evelyn prender was trying to help him . felt emasculated . I want to keep working this just a little longer . - Wilcox reminds me of someone . - Who ? Another vet . Someone I knew a long time ago . Someone I failed . Sullivan ... he 's melancholy . It 's temporary . I 'm not so certain . He 's pining away for something he 'll never have . What 's that ? His old life . Nostalgia . More than that . they call it . Soldier 's heart . too long . What can I do ? Sit with him . Talk to him . I haven 't the time . we 've all done that . What ? Studied too much war . we 'd all have soldier 's heart . Maybe we do . wilcox confessed . You broke him . That 's what I 'm afraid of . Amsterdam . Yes . See you ere . That was the daughter . Susan lucas . about her father . yeah . Dr. Prender tried to apologize . And you wouldn 't accept it . I know my memories are true . You know your father abused you ? I do . And I know he won 't take responsibility for what he did to me . And I know he blames dr . Prender for everything . If he 'd just ... he 'd say he was sorry ... I don 't know . Maybe I could forgive him . Do you think your father could have killed dr . Prender ? My father 's capable of anything . But why now ? The lawsuit was years ago . Because he 's going bankrupt . Because my mother 's leaving him . And he blames dr . Prender . For ruining his life . What about you ? too ? No . She helped me . She 's the one who helped me remember . that it never happened . I think it was just too much for her . What was ? The truth . What happened to her patients . so she decided it wasn 't real . But it was . I didn 't hate dr . Prender . I felt sorry for her . James lucas . hated prender with a passion . but nothing places lucas at the scene . we already have a suspect in custody whose fingerprints are on the weapon and who 's confessed . Amsterdam doesn 't buy it was wilcox . Of course not . Forensics and a confession- - that 's too easy for amsterdam . He 's gotta go fishing for more esoteric suspects . the daughter ? She 's got no alibi either . Says she can 't remember where she was that day . she staked everything on her therapy . you know what ? It never happened . After she destroyed her family . too . Whatever . Knock yourselves out . because the D. A.Likes the guy we got . And so do I. You saw her lying there in her own blood . I did . And you felt bad about it . I did . You tried to help her . What are you doing ? Watch this . I did . I was there in the observation room . I didn 't see it . - See what ? - I led him . Watch . harold . - Yeah . And you killed her . I led wilcox . Got him to remember something that didn 't actually happen . but I did . I ended up hurting him in the worse possible way . Which is exactly what prender did to susan lucas and her family . You guess you did ... or you did ? I did . - That was a false confession ? - Yeah . What are you gonna do about it ? Follow evelyn prender 's example . I remember now . I did it . I didn 't do it ? No . How do you know ? How do you know I didn 't do it ? How do I know ? Sullivan . Now give me the gun . doctor . I ain 't nothin ' but grateful if I didn 't kill that woman . But how do I know for sure ? I 'm not sure I can live with myself . - I can help you . - Can you ? Can you give me my leg back ? I remember hitting her . It never happened . It 's a false memory . the way that I was ? I think not . - I picked up the glass . - Yeah . She died in my arms . don 't ! That part 's true . That part of what you remember is true . You didn 't kill her . I 'll prove it to you . How ? Arrest the person who did it . What are you doing here ? Thought I 'd make that appointment . You could have called . I could have . Follow me . - What are you doing ? - Checking my pulse . That 's my job . It 's just a little experiment . It 's not just traumatic events that make the pulse race . This won 't be traumatic . It is racing . Told you . I read the articles you wrote on ptsd therapies with dr . Prender . Evelyn was intensely interested in how memory works . Especially the effect of trauma on memory . not bury it . Traumatic events are seared into the memory by adrenaline . Adrenaline ? the pulse races . That 's why soldiers and crime victims and holocaust survivors and the victims and first responders from 9 / 11 have had such a hard time putting the past behind them . You ok ? When did dr . Prender change her mind about recovered memory ? Her epiphany came one day when one of her patients and making her eat it . Fried babies . Think you 'd remember something like that . That 's when evelyn realized the whole thing was just hysteria and that she 'd been complicit in encouraging these destructive fantasies . She had a partner at that time . Leonard macvittie ? They had a really bitter falling-out over it . Are you sure prender 's ok with this ? didn 't he ? Relax . and whatever we find is admissible . I wish we had a warrant . There 's an old one in the glove compartment if it makes you feel better . What exactly are we looking for ? Prender said his wife was publishing a book . Why would she hide the manuscript ? Someone found out she was writing a book . Someone didn 't care for something that was in it . Someone asked her to take it out before it was published . When she refused ... someone killed her . Do you have an idea who ? I 'll tell you when we find it . It 's a desk . I already looked through it . It 's a campaign desk from the civil war . Heavy suckers . Fascinating . so they usually had a hidden compartment built in . Like this . You are a freak of nature . so I 've been told . Dr. Leonard macvittie . It must have been a real shock to you when she recanted . Evelyn caved . she abandoned the truth . Did you know she was writing a book ? Was she ? prominently featured ? I don 't see my name anywhere . Sorry . garbage . Libelous trash . Which page was that ? The page where dr . Prender accuses dr . Macvittie here of knowing the therapy was bogus . That the memories they were recovering were false . Isn 't that called malpractice ? What case was that again ? Susan lucas and her family . maybe they 'll sue dr . Macvittie this time . You were still treating her for abuse that never happened . unethical . Have I left anything out ? anything else- - We 're just the messengers . Ok ? You can 't sue us . But if he could ... he 'D ... kill us . Ok . These are dr . Macvittie 's prints from the manuscript page . And these ... are from the murder weapon . I 've identified 18 ridge characteristics in alignment . Which is about as definitive a match as you can get . Want to pick him up ? I 'll take santori . He just loves shrinks . What are you gonna do ? Doctor 's appointment . Everything ok ? Routine tests . thank you . Thank you . Thank you . For what ? It 's a long story . Get yourself some help . Some real help . - I 'll try . - Don 't try . Do it . Find somebody . All right . Somebody who knows what they 're doing . You did what you could . but the physician botched the convalescence . but not how to cure his melancholy . Melancholy . It 's a mystery . It either gets better of its own accord or not . Still ... as you suggested . It ... it might have helped him . I 've written something . Published it myself . Thank you . Leaves of grass What are you grinnin ' about ? I 'm remembering an old friend . He gave me a copy of his book . It 'd be worth some money these days . Somebody we heard of ? He used to be famous . who knows ? Better strike while the iron is hot . by the way ? I need to follow up on that . Dr. Dillane ? Detective . ask you about those test results . You should come by the office . Of course . this is detective amsterdam . Detective . this is my husband robert camp . Pleased to meet you .

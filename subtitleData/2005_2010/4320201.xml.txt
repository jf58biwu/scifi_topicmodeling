 Tyler ? Did you feel that ? Tyler ! Yeah , Mom ? Yeah , you 're in big trouble . No , huge . - I 'm not kidding . - Yeah , I know . Good morning , Roy . Morning , Father Jack . Foreclosures are on the rise , up another 6 % in the last month alone . And housing prices continue to fall ... Even as the latest economic stimulus package ... - Thanks for coming in so early . - Oh , it 's a pleasure . It 's the only time I could make it down here . Ah , don 't even mention it . All right . I 'm a little excited . You got the ring ? Oh , of course I got the ring . She is gonna like this , isn 't she ? She 's gonna love it . You know , I was gonna do the whole " get down on one knee " thing . That 's not too corny , is it ? Knee 's a classic . Can 't go wrong with the knee . - Knee it is . - Good . - What was that ? - I don 't know . Morning , Haley . Hey ! Good morning . - Here . - Thank you . You pitch Freddie my idea ? He loved it , thought it was a great take on the vice president . And let me guess- - he wants Martinez to do it . They love you and all ... Hey , it 's cool . I get it . Shut up , Chad , and read the news . How exactly did you get into a fight ? Crashing a party in Soho . So you snuck out in the middle of the night to go to a party ? Well , it was Brandon 's dumb-ass idea . Who 's a dumb-ass ? Where are you ? Some clinic off of Bloomfield . I 'm coming to get you . Yeah , I-I 'll just take my bike home . It 's ... What 's going on ? ! What is this ? ! - Tyler ! - Mom , what is this ? ! Roy ! Look out ! It 's coming down ! Mom ? Mom ? ! Tyler ? Stay where you are . Tyler , are you somewhere safe ? Mom ? - Mom ! Mom ! - Tyler ? Tyler ! Stay where you are ! - I 'm coming for you ! Tyler ! - Mom ? Something 's wrong , man . I gotta go . I 'm not going anywhere . Oh , my God ! Idiot ! Hey ! Let 's go , kid ! Let 's move it ! Come on ! It 's the only way I can get home ! - Let 's move ! - I mean , all the streets - are blocked , man ! - This area is restricted , kid ! Move ! But w--I mean , what about my bike ? ! No more ! Let 's go ! Move out , people ! Move , move ! - Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - What is that ? Since their arrival , there 's been no contact with any of the 29 ships , now hovering over the major cities of the world . Come on , Ryan , pick up . Streets are jammed . People are trying to flee- - The sheer mass of the ships moving through New York and L.A. was enough to rock both cities for miles- - And N.O.R.A.D. is now confirming the first jet to encounter the spacecrafts experienced full electrical failure . Dude , this is " Independence Day " ! Which was a rip-off of any number of alien invasion predecessors . Oh , thank God ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm okay . Good . Oh , thank God ! - I need to get through . - Nobody is getting through . Look again , Sergeant . - I 'm FBI . - Counterterrorism division . I can read . - You 're still not getting past . - I 'm looking for my son . Everybody is looking - for their son right now . - My son is in there . If you will let me in there , I can find him . I 'm not gonna tell you again . Turn around . Nobody is getting through . - Turn around . - Please ! He called me an hour ago . He 's in there ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Come on , now ! Tyler ? Ty ? Mom ? Tyler ! - Mom ! Oh . - Oh ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm okay . Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Oh , my God . Yeah . " Pilot " Don 't be frightened . We mean no harm . Please accept our apologies . We 're truly anguished by the turmoil our arrival has caused . This is a momentous day . Until now , we believed we were the only intelligent life in the Universe . We 're overjoyed to find that we 're not alone . My name is Anna , and I am the leader of my people . We 're delighted to meet you , but we need your help . We 're far from home ... After we 've replenished ourselves and shared with you what we can , we will leave you , hopefully better than we found you . We look forward to getting to know our new friends . There will be more communication with your world 's leaders in the hours to come . Until then , we are of peace always . " We 're all God 's creatures " ? That 's how the Vatican explains the existence of aliens ? Yes . - They decided that in a day ? - Yes . Rattlesnakes are God 's creatures , too . Doesn 't mean they 're good for us . - Have faith in our leaders , Jack . - I do , Father . It 's just that there 's not a lot of scripture on the subject . Meaning ? I 'm at a loss to explain how God and aliens exist in the same world . Aren 't you ? What do you want to do , Jack ? Call the Vatican and question their position ? No , I just ... I don 't know what to do . All we can do is pray and minster to our congregation . Our congregation amounts to two bag ladies , a heroin addict and Roy . That may be , Father Landry , but we will minister to any size ... congregation . And it appears - there 's some kind of translation ... - Look at that . It--It 's opening up . Oh ! Dude--Dude , that is so cool ! I was right there , man . I was right underneath that thing . Ohh ! Why didn 't I come with you , man ? They 're calling themselves " the Visitors . " You say that like it bothers you . Visitors are old friends who drop by for a drink . Did you see that we got a COMSAT alert today ? Uh , no , I was a little busy looking at the spaceships outside my window . You 're looking at terrorist alerts ? The chatter among terrorist cells worldwide dropped like a rock when the V 's showed up . Except for one of the cells we 've been tracking . Their chatter--instead of falling off , it actually spiked . So what , you think there 's a connection between the two ? We intercepted an uncoded message from them . As of yesterday , they 're suddenly looking to acquire large amounts of C-4 . Why do that unless you 're going after a target ? Like say us , while we 're distracted ? I 'll run the databases . I 'll put together a profile on them . Thank you . You watching ? Yeah , I 'm watching . Anna and her entourage will be escorted into the building where she ... Hey , how are you with all of this ? Are you and Tyler okay ? We 're fine . Did you hear from the ex ? He , uh , he left a message . He wanted us to know he 's okay . Um . I 'm not bitter . It 's fine . I feel good , happy . Hey , you know that I 'm here for you , anything you need . Look , we 'll hit the ground running tomorrow . Go be a mom . You rock . These are live pictures coming to you from the lobby of the United Nations ... - Hey , Mom , it 's starting . - Yeah . Here--here is Anna . She is now approaching the mike for a statement . - Let 's listen in . - Anna , please ! Anna ! - Damn , she 's hot . - I know , right ? ! Right here , guys . This is an inspiring moment for us all- - Mankind and visitors coming together . We are honored by your friendship . We will cherish it , nurture it , and never abandon it . We are of peace always . Anna ! Anna ! Anna , how long have you been ... Anna , what do you have to say about the damage caused by your arrival ? Explain the similarities between visitors and humans . Our scientists say it 's impossible . Our scientists can explain it . That 's not an answer . Why don 't you explain it ? Hey , why don 't you show some respect ? Ooh ! Do you have a question ? Yeah . I have a question . Is there such a thing as an ugly visitor ? I don 't understand . Oh , you all seem to be what we consider attractive . Thank you . You 're not so bad yourself . No , I 'm sorry . No one allowed past this point . Come back here ! Anna ! It was a truly remarkable moment . In the midst of all the chaos and , yes , even hostility from some , came something unexpected from our new friends- - a sense of humor . Should the press be so tough on the V 's ? They did just get here , after all . When we come back , I 'll be joined by a panel of media experts to discuss that and much , much more . Stay with us . We 'll be right back . I want him . It 's been three weeks since the Visitors ' arrival yet thousands are still flocking to see the mother ships in person . As a result , host cities find themselves in the midst of a mini-economic boom- - Tourism , spending on V merchandise- - All a welcome shot in the arm to local economies . The newly opened visitor healing centers are drawing huge crowds . People afflicted with one of the 65 ailments the V 's can cure are jamming the centers , hoping for their own personal miracle . And government officials have begun talks to open Visitor embassies . But not everyone likes the idea . Violent protests denouncing the V 's have broken out in numerous host cities . And more demonstrations are planned in the days to come . More on this ... We finally got a real lead on our cell . Our cell ? - I 've heard that one before . - No , this is a good one . That 's my coffee . A truck suspected of hauling drugs was impounded by N.Y.P.D. last night . They searched for residue- - no drugs . But they did find traces of ... C-4 . Uh-huh . See this ? The truck came from here on Long Island . - Nice ! - Field trip ? Can I drive ? No . - Copy that . - Silos are empty . We 're still searching the grounds , but I gotta tell you , E. , this feels like another dead end . - Yeah . - What 's this , 20 leads we found on this cell so far ? - Every one of them 's fallen through . - Uh-huh . What ? Look at the sat photo . - Yeah ? - That 's our truck . What is a white truck doing parked in front of that shack ? Nothin ' . I think we can rule out suicide . C-4 . Yeah , this is Ryan . I need your help . How 'd you get this number ? They 're here . It 's starting . I 'm not that guy anymore . Don 't call me again . Hey . - Ready for lunch ? - Hey . Oh , yeah . I 'm hungry . What if that was important ? Sweetheart , there is nothing more important than you . How 'd you get tickets ? Dude , I can 't believe we 're about to see the inside of a freakin ' spaceship . You rock . Holy ! This is awesome . Dude ! This is incredible , man ! - It 's like an amusement park . - ... To the main docking station Will only take about two minutes , so hang on tight and enjoy the ride . Wow . Unbelievable , man . Step this way , please , and welcome . Hello . Welcome to the New York mother ship . My name is Lisa . The examiner says the body 's been dead less than a day , but he was tortured before he was killed . They 've been printing fake docs--passports , I.D.s. Best fakes I 've ever seen . It 's a major operation , but no one was here . They cleared out like they knew we were coming . We 'll get the prints off the victim , see if we can get his I.D. Our ability to manipulate gravity is essential for long-term space travel . Dude , dude , check it out . Oh , dude . That V girl 's coming over here . Be cool . Having a good time ? Having a great time . Good . Have you heard about our new peace ambassador program ? Peace ambassador program ? Yeah . You sign up , hang out with V 's , learn about our culture , and you act as V ambassadors to your own communities . You even get a uniform . Ah , it sucks . You have to be 18 years old to join . We 're only 17 . You can still join . You just need your parent 's signature . Yeah . Well , that 's , uh , kind of a tough sell right now . Our parents don 't even know we 're here . It 's too bad . I just got assigned to the New York chapter . We could 've spent some time together . We 're all so quick to jump on the bandwagon . And a ride on the bandwagon , it 's ... It sounds like fun . But before we get on , let us at least make sure it is sturdy ... and sound . Let us at least examine it to really make sure it is something that we want to climb aboard . No one is saying , " Don 't trust the Visitors . " Don 't they need to earn our trust ? It 's something we all need to think about . I thought we were clear about this , Jack . People need to hear the V 's are part of God 's plan . They hear it from you , Father . They need to hear it from you , too . I thank God for the Visitors every day , Jack . This church stood empty for years . Now look at it . The Visitors are not driving people away from God . They 're driving people back to God . People are scared , Father . That 's why they come . But they come , and that 's the blessing in disguise . It bothers me that they showed up right when we needed them the most . The world 's in bad shape , Father . Who wouldn 't welcome a savior right now ? I agree they 're a godsend , and we should be grateful . But that 's the danger . Under the right conditions and with enough time , gratitude can morph into worship ... Or worse--devotion . Hey . I thought you priest types would like to see somethin ' . They healed me . I got no pain . My God , Roy . It 's amazing . Yeah . Ty . Come here for a second . Your principal sent me this link to this ... awesome video . What are you doing on my account ? Check it out . More , more , more ! Come on ! V 's rule ! Come on ! Hurry up . There 's gonna be people coming . - V 's rule ! - V 's rule , man ! First and foremost , the fact that you 're tagging now- - So proud . I called Brandon 's folks to kind of , you know , spread the joy . They weren 't surprised . They said that you two are obsessed with the V 's . I 'm not obsessed . Really ? Because this looks very obsessive to me . Texts , instant messages . And here 's an--an entire page about how to spread their word through tagging . Those aren 't even my links . Brandon sent them to me . Oh . Well , that 's okay then . Brandon sent them to you . So you 're gonna do whatever Brandon or--or the V 's or who--whoever tells you to do ? - You have to think for yourself , Tyler . - I do think for myself ! Tagging someone 's property because a web site tell you to - is thinking for yourself ? - You call it tagging . But you know what ? The V 's- - They call it spreading hope . Okay . Okay . You have to talk to me . Talk to me . You and me , we talk . What 's going on with you ? Is it because of your dad ? Is it because he left ? You 're blaming him ? At least he has an excuse to be out of touch with his kid . He left me . I did not leave . I am here for you . Oh , when you 're here . There he is- - the man of the hour . Hello , Mr. Decker . Hello . - What 's going on , Freddie ? - You 've been selected . For ? Anna would like to do a live broadcast from the ship , and intimate one-on-one to help ease the protests against us . She 'd like you to do the interview . I-I-I got it . Who was that ? It 's no one . - No one ? - Yes . No one . You 've been getting a lot of calls from " no one . " It 's nothing . Okay ? We don 't do this , you and me- - Keep secrets . Talk to me . What 's going on ? What 's going on ? Sweetheart ... Just ... don 't read things into things , okay ? It was no one . Really . So pretty ... - I forgot my spoon . - Yeah . Uh , can I get an extra spoon ? Okay . Thank you , sir . What do you know ? Another fake one . Others like this . Solve the case yet , Sherlock ? Not one name , not one photo , not anything from these passports matches anyone in our system . How can you not find this guy ? He 's very creepy . If only " creepy " were a biometric parameter in our facial recognition software . You 're kind of sexy when you talk all computer-y . - I am ? - Absolutely . What 's this ? Progress . I I.D.ed our victim from the silo . His name is Owen Chapman . This is a search warrant for his house . All right . Clear here ! Yeah , I 'll check ... They knew we were coming again . Someone tipped them off . Who are you calling ? Owen . Owen--our victim Owen ? Text . " To : All attending tonight . " Location : 400 Pier Avenue , Brooklyn , 10 : 00 P.M. Pass code . " If you 're new , be prepared for the test . Any info you can share about this cell is important . " Owen was going to a meeting about a sleeper cell ? If you have info about a sleeper cell , you call the cops . You don 't go to a meeting . Ryan . Stay away from me , Georgie . Ryan , please . Look , I told you I 'm not that guy anymore , okay ? - Stop calling me . - We need your help . " We " ? Who 's " we " ? There 's about 25 of us . We 've only met a couple times but we 're still recruiting . Again ? You 're trying that again after all those people got killed the last time ? We 're being a lot more careful this time . Please , you gotta help us . Look , I 'm about to get engaged , okay ? I 'm not gonna put my fiancé at risk . If I get involved , it puts her at risk , and I 'm not gonna let that happen . So you 're just gonna sit there on the sidelines ? You know how many lives are at stake ? She doesn 't know about my past , okay ? I 'd like to keep it that way . That 's where we 're meeting if you change your mind ... Or grow a conscience . I liked your sermon the other day . You 're right to question the V 's . Are you all right ? I know the real reason they 're here , Father , and I am not the only one . The real reason ? The V 's are gonna obliterate us . You 're bleeding ! I was coming to see you . - The V 's did this to me . - Let me get you some help . No , no , no , no . Take this and go to this address and give it to the people there . All right , all the information 's inside . - Promise me . - Okay . Please , it 's important . Okay . Okay , okay . I 'm gonna get you some help . I 'll be right back . Thanks again for choosing me to do this . - I 'm really excited . - So are we . Do you have any questions before we go to air ? No . Just be sure not to ask anything that would paint us in a negative light . Excuse me ? Don 't ask any questions that would portray us negatively . Ask ones like you did when we first met . Oh , I think there 's a mistake . I 'm a journalist . It 's my job to ask questions even if they make the other person uncomfortable . That was not my understanding . Standing by to go to air . Afraid I don 't have a choice . This interview is now canceled . Whoa , whoa , whoa , hang on . Hang on . Look , this is just how it 's done . I swear I 'll be fair . You 'll need to be more than fair if you want to proceed . Two minutes to air . We can 't be seen in a negative light . This interview would elevate your career , wouldn 't it , Mr. Decker ? Don 't you want to elevate your career ? You don 't even know what this meeting is , and you 're just gonna go in like you 're invited . They 're expecting people they haven 't met before , so , yeah . This is stupid . Why don 't we call for backup ? You know why . Because you think that there 's a mole tipping off our cell . It 's a closed loop if it 's just you and me . All right , then I 'm coming in with you . No . It 's a bad idea . I need you to watch the perimeter . I will be back in 30 minutes . If I 'm not , you can call in the cavalry . I 'm here for the meeting . This is a word-of-mouth group . You 're here because someone we trust personally referred you . This is how we do things . This woman is a doctor . She 'll be injecting a small dose of anesthetic into each of you . Wait--wait a minute . Anesthetic for what ... exactly ? Good evening and welcome . Tonight , " Prime Focus with Chad Decker " is proud to present an up close and personal interview with Anna , the Visitor high commander . On behalf of all of us , I wanna thank you for this opportunity to get to know you a little better . Thank you , Chad , and please , feel free to ask anything and everything . I 'm here to discuss all topics without reserve . I want you to confirm that you see skull bone . Take a good look at it . It 's important . You 're next . What is life like where you come from ? We come from a place of great beauty , vast cities , massive oceans . Much like Earth . Though unlike you , we don 't divide ourselves into countries . We 're one united people . You 've all passed the test . Test for what ? To ensure that you 're not a Visitor . In order to walk among us , they disguise their appearance by cloning human flesh over their own reptilian skin . I thought everyone here was up to speed . The Visitors didn 't just get here . They 've been here for years . You 've said we 're the only other intelligent life you 've encountered in your travels . Yes . Humanity is a rare gift , one we hold in the highest regard . For decades , they 've been implementing a plan that will result in the extermination of every man , woman and child on the face of this earth . We 're honored and privileged to be able to assist mankind with our knowledge and technology . Truth be told , it stirs great emotion in us . So you are emotional beings ? We are , but we 've evolved to quickly process and expel all negative feelings . Happiness , we 've learned , comes from tranquility and peace . V 's posing as humans established themselves in all facets of life , whether it be business , government , religion , the military . It took years . And once embedded among us , they set out to cause worldwide instability- - Unnecessary wars , economic meltdown , faith twisted into extremism . If you could speak to the protesters , what would you say ? That embracing change is never easy , but the reward for doing so can be far greater than anything you can imagine . Tonight we 're announcing the expansion of our healing centers . The goal is to open one in every major city across the world . The final stage of the Visitors ' plan began with them revealing themselves to us . They gain trust with the promise of friendship and technology . And , of course , all they 're really doing is positioning themselves as the saviors of mankind . The intent goes beyond just healing . We want to provide complete medical services to all . You 're talking about ... universal health care ? I believe that 's what you call it , yes . By the time people figure this out , it 'll be too late . They 'll take over ... unless we can stop ' em . I see the looks . It 's the first time hearing this for some of you . You think we 're crazy . Right ? Do you have any proof ? You know , other than scary stories being passed around the Internet . Who are you ? Who referred you ? It doesn 't matter . I 'm leaving . Wait , wait . I have proof ... I think . It 's a bunch of photos- - Supposedly Visitors living on Earth . - This guy is a visitor ? - Yeah . This guy is a terrorist . He 's part of a sleeper cell . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . A sleeper cell of visitors . Yeah , a sleeper cell of visitors . You did a brave thing coming here tonight . Well , if I 'm so brave , why am I scared to death ? I think that makes you human . I 'm Erica . Jack . Get down ! Ryan ! What the hell , Dale ? ! Aah ! Aah ! No , Erica ! Let 's go ! Where the hell did they come from ? - We were so careful this time . - Georgie- - No . You were right to walk away . - What hope do we have ? - There is hope . But they are animals ! No . No . Not all of them . I was wrong to walk away from this , Georgie . You were right to fight . There 's others out there like me ... Other traitors , deserters . We 'll help . Ryan . Where you going ? I gotta go tell Val I 'm leaving . It 's not safe for her to be around me anymore . Mr. Decker ? Mr. Decker , may I have a word with you , please ? Anna loved you . I 'm sure she did . She wants you to know we intend to call on you again . She trusts you . Yeah , I 'm not so sure I trust her . Look , I 'm sorry for the misunderstanding tonight , but you did the right thing . Compromising one 's principles for the greater good is not a shameful act . It 's a noble one . Really ? I find that hard to believe . Your people are easily threatened . What you did tonight went a long way toward reassuring them . What 's the harm ? She backed me into a corner . She could 've chosen anyone to interview her . She chose you . We would like to continue with the arrangement . Whenever Anna has something significant to say , we would like her to say it through you . Unless you have an aversion to a worldwide audience hanging on your every word . Val ? I hate myself . You just--you kept getting these calls from " no one , " and ... I thought there was somebody else . I-I looked around and I found this . You were gonna ask me to marry you . I was even gonna get down on one knee . Do you still love me ? More than you 'll ever know . I don 't know who to trust anymore . I can 't get the image of Dale just lying there out of my head . What do we do now ? We help build a resistance . We recruit ... Bring more into the fold . We have to be careful . We 'll be careful , but we have to fight . Oh , we 'll fight . They have a big head start . They 're arming themselves with the most ... powerful weapon out there . Yeah ? What 's that ? Erica , what big weapon ? Devotion . To the dawn of a new day . We are of peace always .

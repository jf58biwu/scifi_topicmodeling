 This programme contains some violent scenes . 'Torchwood - tracking down alien life on earth , arming the human race against the future . 'The 21st century is when everything changes and you 've got to be ready . ' Suzie Costelloe . Why did you kill those people ? The more I used the glove , the more I control it . If I could get it to work all the time , it could resurrect ... I loved this job . I really loved it . At last . You must be Torchwood ? My team bitch about you all the time . And you are ? Detective Swanson . I 'm Captain Jack Harkness . So I 've heard . Are you always this dressy for a murder investigation ? What , d 'you rather me naked ? God help me , the stories are true . So who 's the victim ? That 's victims , plural . Yesterday , a man was murdered at 96 Oakham Street , Alex Arwyn , 28 , single , estate agent , here we go , that 's from the scene of crime . Today , in here , we get two more , Mark and Sarah Brisco , both 33 , married , he 's a surveyor , she works in education . What about the smears of blood ? Is that writing ? Work in progress . Come inside and see the finished thing . Oh , my God ... Looks like somebody wants your attention . They 've got it . We found a few of the killer 's hairs from the first murder . Lab results should be in soon . Good , we 'll need that . Now , if you could just clear the room ? Some of this equipment is strictly need to know . It was only a matter of time . What was ? Torchwood walks all over this city , like you own it . Now these people are paying the price - ordinary people , ripped apart , with your name written in their own blood . From where I 'm standing , you did this , Captain Jack Harkness . You did it . Still , at least we 've got a head start . If it 's someone we 've pissed off , that narrows it down to ... ooh , four or five million . And that 's just the humans . Tosh , how we doing ? There 's no record of Mr and Mrs Brisco on our database . Nor yesterday 's victim , and no link between him and the Briscos . No connection between any of them . Jack ? They 've got the results on the killer 's hair . Initial findings say , Caucasian male , early 40s , smoker , drinks tequila . Doesn 't match any DNA profiles . Only thing of interest is a compound we 've never seen before . Recognise it ? Oh , we 're in trouble . What is it ? Compound B67 . You 're kidding ? Retcon . He 's got Retcon in his blood . B67 , aka Retcon , aka the magic ingredient of the amnesia pill . And this belongs to us ? This killer is somebody we gave the amnesia pill to ? Is he remembering that he 's a serial killer ? Or is he becoming a serial killer because of the Retcon ? Wait a minute . I 've taken Retcon . Then better stay away from sharp objects . Ianto , how many people have we given amnesia pills to ? 2,008 . Hey , what if they all become psychotic ? ! D 'you have to sound so happy ? I 'm just saying . Mean Streets ! Tosh , narrow the list down to fit Swanson 's profile , start checking them out . You two , there 's got to be a link between the victims , find the link , find the killer . Get to it ! Jack ? If there is a link , why don 't we just ask the victims ourselves ? Not the right time for a seance , thank you very much . The first time I met Torchwood , you had that glove . Heh-heh , no way ! Not after what it did to Suzie . It brings people back to life . We could question the murder victims . That 's exactly what she said . She was one of us , we trusted her and she 's dead cos of that thing . The glove stays in the safe where it belongs . These murders are happening because of Torchwood . So Torchwood has got to do something . It fell through the Rift about 40 years ago . Lay at the bottom of the Bay till we dredged it up . I always figured , this wasn 't just lost . Whoever made it , wanted rid of it . You know , we never gave it a cool name . I thought we called it the resurrection gauntlet ? COOL name . What about the Risen Mitten ? I think it 's catchy . Jack ? You OK ? Don 't forget , the maximum resurrection time is two minutes , and that was only cos Suzie had practice . The most we 're likely to get is 30 seconds . Tosh , ready ? Ready . And , recording . This man was victim number one . Name - Alex Arwyn . Come on , Alex . Come back . How does it work ? You just sort of feel . Like reaching into the dark . Finding the dead . I can 't ... I don 't ... Ah . Damn ! Ah ! Ah ! Nothing ! Sorry . Never was very good with this thing . Owen ? I tried last time . We all had a go , it only responded to Suzie . Well , I never had a go . It 's cold . It warms up . The glove relies on some sort of empathy . Maybe compassion and ... Just be yourself . BEEPING SHE GASPS Somebody help me ! Oh , my God , help me , help me , help me ! Alex ! I need you to listen to me . Somebody help ! HELP ME ! Alex , you were attacked . Do you know who it was ? Who attacked you ! ? Who are you ? How long ? - Where am I ? - 15 seconds . Who are you ? I 'm trying to help , sweetheart . I want my mum . Please ! Let me see my mum ... REPETITIVE BEEPING FOLLOWED BY PROLONGED BEEP He 's gone . Let me keep trying . Gwen , he 's dead . I can bring him back . The glove only works once . I can do it , let me try . Gwen . Look at me . He 's gone . That was amazing , she 's a natural . 24 seconds ! Give Ianto a stopwatch , and he 's happy . It 's the button on the top . What d 'you think , Gwen ? D 'you want to stop ? Recording . Victim number two - Mark Brisco . Oh God , I can feel him , it 's like a rope from my heart to the glove ... Oh , it 's so warm . Hey , there . Just look at me . Look me in the eye . That 's it . You 've been hurt , we don 't have long , we need to know who attacked you . We 're looking after her . Now Mark , who was it ? What 's Pilgrim ? No , Mark , he 's gone , we don 't have long , quickly , what was his name ? 35 seconds . Never knew his surname . Trying Pilgrim and Max , get a description . You gotta give us something more so we can catch him . He 's going . There was ... There was someone who knew him better ... That woman ... She was always talking to him ... What was her name ? Where 's my wife ? Her name ! Suzie . REPETITIVE BEEPING FOLLOWED BY PROLONGED BEEP One minute five seconds . Jack ? Did I hear that right ? Could be anyone , Could be anyone , there must be lots of women called Suzie . Not connected to this case . there must be lots of women called Suzie . Not connected to this case . We 've been talking to the wrong corpse . Pilgrim . A religious support group , more like a debating society , meaning of life , does God exist ? All that stuff . The point is , it was tiny , more like a hobby , run by Mark Brisco 's wife , Sarah . She had all that stashed in the wardrobe . Handwritten and photocopied , that 's why we couldn 't find any records , she wasn 't even online . No mention of Suzie , or Max ? Not a word . She didn 't even keep a register . It wouldn 't be our Suzie , though . She wouldn 't go to that support group bollocks . How do you know ? I mean , were you friends ? Any of you ? Who was her best friend in this place ? She sort of kept herself to herself . Well , then . If she needed to talk , maybe that 's exactly where she 'd go , a group of complete strangers . Could be . You 've got a point , Gwen . Time we got to know our deceased colleague a little better . Have I got this right ? When I die , you get to keep all my possessions ? My whole life 's gonna get stashed in a locker ? Rules and regulations . What if I leave all my stuff to Rhys ? We 'll stash him away , too . Tread carefully , people . With respect . This is the life of Suzie Costello . That 's all we are , in the end . A pile of boxes . Is her father still alive ? Don 't know . But you must 've looked him up ? To tell him his daughter was dead ? When Suzie left Torchwood , she was on the run . She wiped all her records . I couldn 't retrieve her files , she was good at computers . Huh ... She was good at everything . She was good at murder too . Laugh a minute , that was Suzie . What 's that ? A book . Emily Dickinson . Poet . Jack . Pilgrim . She 's part of it . That proves it , then . No choice . It 's time Suzie came back . Do we all get frozen ? Torchwood staff , when we die , do we all get kept ? Rules and regulations . How long for ? Forever . Recording . Have you got your stopwatch ? Always . I 'll record from my station . I 'm sorry , but I don 't want to look her in the eye . Sorry . Anyone else ? Any advice ? Yeah , I know . Empathy . Even though she did try to kill me . You and me both . SHE GASPS I 'm getting a reading . No , it 's gone ... SHE BREATHES HEAVILY Just ... memories . Nothing living . She 's too far gone . What do we do now ? Nothing we can do . That 's it . We 're out of options . There 's always the knife . When she killed all those people , she always used the knife , it 's made out of the same metal as the glove . We 've seen it before , metallic resonance . The glove works better if the knife 's part of the process , like closing a circuit . Then let 's use it . Small detail . The knife was used to kill people . She 's already dead . So we kill her again . Ianto ? Life knife . Anything ? No , there was just a sort of spark and then it was gone . I 'm sorry , Jack . You 're gonna have do it properly . What the hell . SUZIE AND GWEN GASP Suzie ? I 've gotta go ! I can 't stay , they know . Just look at where you are . Think back , try to remember ... Suzie ! Suzie ! Look at me ! Jack . Oh , my God . There 's a knife in my chest , did you kill me ? You killed yourself , remember ? But ... Oh my God , I shot myself . We 've got to ask you about Pilgrim . No . Wait a minute . Didn 't I kill you ? Never mind that , we need names and details . Who 's using the glove ? I 'm sorry . Oh , wouldn 't you know it , Gwen bloody Cooper . 30 seconds . When you were in Pilgrim you gave the amnesia pill to a man , Max , do you remember ? What ? You brought me all the way back , just for Max ? ! We need to find him . Who is he ? What 's his surname ? He was ... some loser ... We 're losing her ! Stay here . Damn you ! Don 't force it , Gwen . She 's not getting away this time , stay here ! No ! I told you to stop ! It 's all right , I 've got her , I 've got her ... Hold on ... OK , pulse . She 's all right . We need to get her out of here . Can you give me a hand ? It 's the glove , I told you they get hooked . All right , don 't make a fuss , it 's over now . Um , excuse me . I 'm still counting . There 's not much point , she 's dead . No , according to the equipment , she 's unconscious . What the hell 's going on ? Oh , my God . He 's right . She 's alive ! Suzie 's still alive . Look at her , she 's bloody breathing ! She can 't be ... Nope . Still breathing . No stopping her . She won 't die . One minute thirty and counting . MACHINE BEEPS How long 's it been ? Three months . When can I die ? I just want to go . Can 't you leave me alone ? You seem to be stuck . But ... Am I gonna stay like this ? For how long ? Don 't know . Can I see my father ? No . You wiped your records . We had no trace of him . So , he doesn 't even know that I 'm dead ? Well , you 're not any more . This is sick . You started it . Right now , we 've got an investigation underway . Pilgrim . You visited these Pilgrim meetings and gave an amnesia pill to someone called Max . How do we find him ? What for ? What did he do ? He was just an ordinary bloke . We think the Retcon triggered a psychosis . He 's started killing . How many victims ? Three . Same as you . We need to know , how much Retcon did you give him ? Owen . Hello . Scared to face me ? You frighten the shit out of me , yeah . What about Toshiko ? Is she still here ? Yeah , she 's here . All the gang . Happy days . But the amnesia pills , how many did you give him ? One a week . Every week . For two years . Christ ! No wonder . What the hell did you do that for ? I just ... I wanted someone to talk to . About this place . It was driving me mad . And he was just ... He listened , that 's all , he listened . Every week , as soon as I 'd finished talking , I 'd give him the pill . You overdosed him . I didn 't know that ! Keep getting it wrong , don 't I ? Is that why you brought me back ? Did you think I wasn 't guilty enough ? What was his surname ? I don 't know . All I ever did was talk about me . It 's all my fault , isn 't it ? Never bloody stops being my fault . Can 't you just let me die ? You don 't get off that easy . Yeah , you did warn me , right at the beginning . He said , " This is the one job you can never quit . " Then let 's get to work . Come on , Suzie ! Just like the old days . There 's gotta be something . Hold on ... There 's someone missing . This girl came every week , student , blonde ... She 's not in these photos . Who was she ? Lucy . Lucy Mackenzie . Said she worked at a club . Which one ? Uhhh ... Come on , Suzie ? Which club ? For God 's sake , this Max is killing every single member of Pilgrim . Now tell me , Lucy Mackenzie , where did she work , which club ? ! Wolf . The Wolf Bar . POUNDING ROCK MUSIC Cover the exits . Bloody hell , like I didn 't have a banging headache already . That 's the glove , Gwen . Gets inside your mind . Yeah , all right Suzie , stop creeping me out . Just tell us , any sign of Max or this Lucy Mackenzie ? Nothing yet . Keep moving round . Keep alert , people . To repeat , Max is described as 40 , six-three , six-four , stocky , short dark hair , tattoo down his left arm . That narrows it down . Can 't even look at me , can you ? It 's not like you to be so judgemental . Not like you to go on a murder spree . All right , so it drives us mad , this job . God knows , I 've done some stupid stuff . But now , I 've got to keep on working , every day , in a job that 's got a bit less honour , because of you . Wait , I 've got a match on that guy . Where is he ? Northwest Bar . Show me . Owen , get in closer , which one do you mean ? Wait , he 's going over for the ... Wait , I 've got a match on our girl , Lucy Mackenzie , the student . That 's her , that 's definitely her . It 's too late , he 's going over . Got the bastard ! That isn 't him . Gwen ! Behind you ! That 's one for Ianto . Risen mitten , life knife and that old classic , stun gun . Come on , let 's get him out of here . You saved my life . Maybe I came back for a reason . SIRENS WAIL OK , so your name is Max Tresillian , can you confirm that ? You live at 106 Endeavour Terrace , is that right ? Parents , Sandra and Dave , yeah ? You 're inside the Torchwood facility . GROWLS And five , six ... Keep watching . Soon as we reach ten ... Just stops dead . If this is a drug-induced psychosis , it 's a very specific one . Like he reacts to the word Torchwood . Thanks , Jack . Sorry . But if that 's caused by Retcon , we 've got a million more problems on the way . Let me know what the scan says . But , what about Suzie ? What are you gonna do with her ? No idea . What do you think ? You 're the boss . Torchwood ! GROWLS Can 't you ask Jack ? Just one favour ? I want to see my father . Tell us where he is , we could bring him in . I 'm not letting him anywhere near Torchwood . If he 's still alive . What 's wrong with him ? Cancer . All that waiting , and then I go and die first . I could contact him on your behalf . And say what ? So , tell me . Since I 've been gone , you enjoying it ? Yes . Well , you know , this place is sort of ... It 's mad , isn 't it ? Insane . Bloody nuts . Best job I ever had . Me too . And the worst . Yeah , tell me about it . Funny thing is , you always imagine when you 're dead , they 're gonna miss me at work . Indispensable ! But look what happened . I got replaced ... .. by someone better . You got that glove working , better than I did . Just got lucky . No , it 's more than that . The others , they prefer you . Don 't say that . You got my job . Almost like you planned it . Except I didn 't . And I 'm sorry , but I 've got my own function at Torchwood and I 'm a lot more than just a replacement . Have you slept with Owen ? There you go , replaced me completely . I had a boyfriend who used to walk into rooms like that . The grand entrance . It got kind of boring . Although , he was one of twins , so I put up with it . Twin acrobats . Man , I gotta write that book . Maybe even illustrate it . I can talk for a long time , a very long time . Takes me a while to piece things together . Meaning ? Suzie had the glove . You put her in charge of it . But tell me , Jack , did you ever ask about her father ? How do you mean ? He 's got cancer . He 's been dying slowly now for years . And what do you do ? You give his daughter the one device that brings people back to life ! Is it any wonder she got obsessed ? Oh , so is this all my fault ? ! Well , isn 't it ? Did you ever stop and think ? Did you ... Did you ever look at Suzie ? Did you ever ... think what that glove would do to her , did you ? Right from the start , you thought that Suzie 's death was because of you , Cos it happened when you arrived . Then you brought her back to life , all the way , because you wanted it so much . OK ! We 're both responsible ! Now , what the hell are we going to do with her ? ! I don 't know . What if she never dies ? Have you thought of that ? Like ... Undying , forever . Just you and her . No way . Could be . I wouldn 't wish that on her . I 'd sooner kill her right now . Could you , though ? Kill her ? Yeah . Really ? Oh , yeah . 'Jack , can you come to the conference room ? Something I need you to see . Kind of urgent . ' I was going over Suzie and Gwen 's medical records . I ran them through the filter . Watch the footage . This is the moment when Gwen brought back Mark Brisco , the husband . See ? Now look at his death . See ? The energy flow stops just as he 's about to die . But ... have a look at Gwen with Suzie . Whoa . What is that ? Energy . Life . But with Suzie , it 's a permanent connection and she 's getting stronger . It 's still going , now . She 's draining the life out of Gwen . There 's always a price . More coffee ? Is that all you do ? Just leave me alone . Have a biscuit , at least . Go on . Just for me . The wearer of the glove can bring somebody back , but loses their own life in return . How do we stop it ? We 've got to kill her . Suzie 's got to die . Again . Who 's gonna do it ? Like you said . I 'm the boss . Toshiko ! Where the hell 's Suzie ? And where 's Gwen ? Interrogation Room . No they 're not ... Find them , fast ! I can 't see them . Hold on . Scanning . Nope . Nothing on internal scans . What 's going on , where 've they gone ? Just keep looking ... Bring up the SUV . Still there . I 'll try exteriors ... What about Gwen 's car ? What 's she doing ? Getting herself fired . Unbelievable . How stupid is that ? Thinking she could just drive off . Come on . Let 's go get them . What the hell ... Ianto ? Ianto ? Captain ! What happened ? I thought you must 've done it . We 've gone into lockdown . Then reverse it ! I can 't . It 's 100 % . The doors are sealed . We 're locked in ! I 'm taking you to see your dad and that 's it , OK ? Sorry . I must be mad . Jack 's not stupid . He 's gonna catch us . Oh , you never know . We might get lucky . Everything 's gone . Computers , mobile coverage , the lifts , everything ... We 're sealed in . How long does Gwen have before she dies ? Two hours , maybe less . Come on ! Think ! If Suzie set up the lockdown , how did she do it ? Entered an override ? She 's officially dead , she wouldn 't get access . Then how did she do it ? What the hell did she do ? ! There 's got to be an answer . Suzie couldn 't physically start the lockdown , Gwen wouldn 't have let her . But there 's no-one else ! Wait a minute ... We 've got a guest . .. Stopped for me The carriage held but just ourselves and immortality Because I could not stop for death ... Is that a poem ? I wonder . Emily Dickinson ? But what does it mean ? It 's a verbal trigger . Say it out loud , maybe repeat it 100 times over and the Hub locks down . But if that 's part of the system , Suzie must 've installed a vocal command programme , way back . Back when she was alive , yeah . Max is just a Trojan horse . Suzie planned this right from the start . 'Do you see ? Max , the Retcon , everything , it 's all been a hoax to get us to resurrect Suzie . ' She gave Max a whole complex of subconscious triggers . Like , she dies , Max becomes a time bomb ... He doesn 't see her for three months and , wham , the orders kick in . He follows Suzie 's program , and starts killing . And the whole chain of events forces us to bring Suzie back . And then she escapes ! That is not bad ! I 'm picking her for my team . If she could lockdown the Hub , she must 've installed a way of reversing it . A bit more colour in your cheeks . It 's all thanks to you . That night ... my last night on Earth , or so I thought ... .. before I shot myself , I shot Jack right through the head . I killed him , stone dead and then he just stood up and lived . Am I right ? Did that happen ? Gwen ? Yes , it did . So he can survive a bullet through the head ? Yeah . How ? I don 't know . He won 't explain it properly . Said something happened to him a while back . He said ... He said he can 't die . Not ever . And he makes judgments about whether I 'm allowed to live . It 's all very easy for Captain Jack , isn 't it ? Do you ever wonder ? What ? Who is he ? All the time . DIALLING TONE I 've got reception , sir . How do you do that ? We 're sealed off ! Just used the Water Tower as a relay . Nice work , Ianto ! But who the hell do we phone ? ! PHONE RINGS Detective Swanson . Who is it ? Torchwood . You 'd better not be wasting my time . I was wondering if you could do us a favour . The humble police , helping the mighty Torchwood ? Why don 't you just help yourselves ? Like you normally do . Because we can 't . Why 's that ? Why don 't you just help yourselves ? Like you normally do . Because we can 't . Why 's that ? We 're sort of busy . Well , I 'm busy too , try someone else . No , no , no ... It 's just because we can 't at the moment because we 're sort of stuck . In what way ? We 're locked in . You 're locked in ? Just a bit . Locked in where ? Um . In our own base . You 're locked inside your own base ? And it 's not funny . And how am I supposed to help you , exactly ? We need a book of poetry . 'It 's NOT funny ! ' Oh , God , driving at night ... GWEN SWITCHES RADIO ON # Just a little ... # Oh , my God . I don 't know this one . It 's ancient . My Mum used to sing this , when I was a kid . All those years ago ... # O-o-o-oh , soleil , soleil ... # .. before I died . # Soleil , soleil # O-o-o-oh , soleil , soleil ... # All right , Captain Jack , just say that one more time . Nice and clear . We 're locked in our own base and we can 't get out . LAUGHTER OK , you 've had your fun . Listen , Detective Swanson , one of our team is in danger . Right , you lot , back to work ... OK , we 've got it . The Complete Poems , it 's gonna cost you 20 quid . What does the book say ? Er , I don 't know , what am I supposed to do ? ! Find I Could Not Stop For Death . Read out the next verse . What if it doesn 't work ? Read out the whole book . It 's gonna be a long night . Tired ? I 'm fine . Don 't want you falling asleep at the wheel . One corpse is enough for this car , thanks . Don 't say that . What ? Corpse . Cos you 're not . What am I , then ? I dunno , you 're just not , though . When you 're dead ... I mean , when you die ... What happens ? What do you want me to say ? The truth . Really ? Tell me . You religious ? Just sort of in passing , you know . Do you believe in Heaven ? I dunno . Yes , you do . What do you believe ? Stupid , but I always sort of think ... Like , you know , white light and all that . And I think of my Gran . Like she 'll be there . Waiting for me . The smell of carbolic . Your faith never left primary school . So what 's out there ? Nothing . Just nothing . But , if there 's nothing , what 's the point of it all ? This is . Driving through the dark . All this stupid , tiny stuff . We 're just animals , howling in the night , cos it 's better than silence . I used to think about Torchwood , all those aliens , coming to Earth ... What the hell for ? But it 's just instinct . They come here cos there 's life , that 's all . Moths around a flame . Creatures clinging together in the cold . So when you die , it 's just ... Darkness . And you 're all alone ? There 's no-one else ? I didn 't say that . What do you mean ? Why do you think I 'm so desperate to come back ? There 's something out there ... in the dark ... .. and it 's moving . Parting is all we know of heaven and all we need of hell . No , try another . Success is counted sweetest by those who ne 'er succeed . Christ , she was a bundle of laughs . Success is counted sweetest by those who ne 'er succeed . Nope . Wait a minute , just had a thought ... If words cause the lockdown , maybe numbers reverse it ... Try the ISBN , every book 's got a different number . You getting this ? Yup , hang on , I 'm looking ... Read it out . The keyboards aren 't working . The membrane might recognise the code . OK . Got it ! ISBN 0198600585 . That 's it ! Everybody , move , move ! Cathy , thank you . Pleasure ! I 've got the tracker on Gwen 's car . It 's a hospital . Giving you the co-ordinates now . On the way . How long 's she got ? It 's only a guess , but I 'd give Gwen about 40 minutes . Kathy , I want the road ahead clear . I 'm gonna break the speed limit , big time . All units , give Torchwood priority , repeat , give Torchwood priority . MACHINE BEEPS Suzie ... I don 't , em ... I 'm not ... Oh , my God , this headache , it 's ... What 's happening to me ? I 'm sorry , Gwen . You 're getting shot in the head . Slowly . And believe me , it hurts . Almost better . Completely gone , soon . No ! No , no , no ... Dad ? GWEN CRIES It 's me , Dad . Wake up ! Dad ? It 's Suzie . Hello , Dad . Ow ! And goodbye . What are you doing ? BEEPING Oh , that 's worth coming back for . Sending him into the dark . Just what the bastard deserves . They 're moving again . Can 't predict a specific destination , not yet . Keep feeding it through , we 're catching up . PHONE RINGS Hello ? Did you like the poem , Jack ? Suzie , don 't let her die . The glove is killing Gwen and keeping you alive . I know . Then stop . But I get to live . Why would I stop ? For Gwen 's sake . She replaced me . Now , I 'm doing the same to her . Isn 't that fair ? Suzie , we 've got a tracker on that car , we 're gonna catch up , I promise . And what happens then ? If she 's dead , then I 'm gonna kill you , Suzie Costello . I promise , I 'm gonna kill you for the last and final time . But would you ? When there 's a part of her that 's now me ? Could you really do that if I 'm the only thing left of her ? Why are you doing this ? Because life is all , Jack . You should know . I 'd do anything to stay . Anything . Suzie . Please . Just stop . She 's a real find , this one . Gwen Cooper . She 's better than me . She 's so much better . I was never any good . Jack , I 'm sorry . SUZIE ! Jack , she 's heading for the coast line on the B587 . It 's a place called Hedley Point , there 's some sort of ferry , goes out to the islands . Get a move on . Owen , how long we got ? Minutes . It 's beautiful , Gwen . Can you see ? We 'll take the ferry . Go out . As far as we can . Keep on running cos he won 't hurt us . We 'll keep on going , you and me ... Oh , I 'm sorry . Have you gone ? Gwen ? Can you hear me ? Gwen ? Poor Gwen Cooper . Safe journey . Let her go . I can 't . Let Gwen go . I can 't . Owen , how is she ? Owen ! Report ! I think we 're too late . If I kill you , does she live ? But you can 't , Jack . Cos look at me . I 'm the last thing left of Gwen Cooper , can 't you see it ? Just the smallest bit of her ? Not one bit . Owen ? Anything ? Nothing . But I broke the connection . I killed you . Can 't die . Never gonna die . How much more of this do you want ? It 's all your fault , Jack . You recruited me . The glove . Tosh !

There 's something moving in the dark and it 's coming , Jack Harkness . It 's coming for you . Whoah ! Whoah ! It 's OK . It 's OK , it 's OK , it 's OK . SIRENS WAIL # If I should die this very moment # I wouldn 't fear # For I have never known completeness # Like being here # Wrapped in the warmth of you # Loving every breath of you # Still my heart , this moment # Or it might burst # Could we stay right here till the end of time ? # Till the earth stops turning ? # Wanna love you till the seas run dry # I found the one I 've waited for . # Thanks for doing this . Part of my job , sir . No , I should be doing it , but ... One day , we 're going to run out of space ... If you 're interested ... I 've still got that stopwatch . So ? Well . Well , think about it . Lots of things you can do with a stopwatch . Oh , yeah . I can think of a few . There 's quite a list . I 'll send the others home early . See you in my office in ten . That 's ten minutes and counting . Oh , Jack ? What do you want me to say on the death certificate ? Good question . She had quite a few deaths in the end . I don 't know . Death by Torchwood . I 'll put a lock on the door , just in case she goes walking again . Nah , no chance of that . The resurrection days are over , thank God . Oh , I wouldn 't be too sure . That 's the thing about gloves , sir . They come in pairs . Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd

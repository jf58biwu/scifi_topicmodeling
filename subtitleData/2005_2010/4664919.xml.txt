 Self-proclaimed artificial human made by aliens . Self-proclaimed time traveling girl . Self-proclaimed squad of esper boys . Each one has shown me honest proof of their identity . Good morning ! each for their own reasons ... Kyon-kun ! ... have been focusing on Haruhi Suzumiya . Wake up already ! Come on ! Even if I accept everything that 's happened or been said ... You 'll be late ! ... there is still one thing I just don 't get . Hurry up ! Why me ? time travelers and the esper boys are swarming around Haruhi ... according to Koizumi she wished for it to happen . Then what about me ? Why have I been dragged into this bizarre mess ? I 'm off ! I 'm a 100 % genuine ordinary high school student . No special powers or anything . Good morning ! Who came up with this scenario ? Haruhi ? right . It 's no concern of mine . Why should I have to worry about this crap ? It looks like everything is Haruhi 's fault . In that case ... not me . and Asahina-san they should just tell everything directly to her . Whatever happens to the world afterwards will be Haruhi 's responsibility and have nothing to do with me . Run around all you want . Just don 't get me involved . Yo ! Taniguchi . right ? Not too sure about that . A normal high school student wouldn 't push down a girl in an empty classroom . an A - by my ranking . I explained . The story going through Taniguchi 's mind ... and completely fictional . Nagato was the unfortunate victim when the literary club clubroom was turned into Haruhi 's base . She was troubled so she came to me for help . I had to sympathize with her sincere request so I felt I should help out the poor girl . We decided to discuss remedial measures in the classroom after Haruhi had gone home . Then Nagato 's chronic anemia kicked in and she fainted ... which was when ... Taniguchi . once the truth has been brought to light it seems like such a trivial thing . 237 ) } Liar . 222 ) } Bah Even if I believe your lies the fact that the antisocial Yuki Nagato would come to you for help already makes you not normal . huh ? you 're one of Suzumiya 's people . If you can be considered a normal high school student then I 'm as normal as a water flea . Taniguchi . Can you use ESP ? I see ... You 've finally been infected by Suzumiya 's poison ... Stay away from me ... I 'll catch Suzumiya . 50 ) } The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya VI Why aren 't you getting changed ? Because it 's hot . Who cares . I 'll have to change again once I get to the clubroom anyway . and it 's easier to move in these . Guess that makes sense . What should we have Mikuru-chan wear next ? After bunny and maid the next would be ... Wait ! There 's more ? Kitty ears ? Nurse outfit ? Or perhaps a queen ? Kitty ears ... Nurse outfit ... Or a que â€” Dumb face . You 're the one who brought up the subject . Seriously ...

That 's what she meant . Did you just figure something out ? No . It 's nothing . Huh ? What is this ? Jacked up ! Why is my name on here ? What 's inside ? show me ! well ... I wonder what this is . I 'm sure it 's nothing important . Sounds like a lie . Asahina-san . Could you let go ... Geez . Come on . Just for a bit ! Okay ? Okay ? Pretty please ? What are you people doing ? So maids turn you on ? What are you talking about ? I 'm going to get changed . Go ahead . I said I 'm going to get changed ! What about it ? Get out ! What 's with her ? She never has any qualms about changing in the classroom . My arms and shoulders feel cool but this outfit doesn 't allow much ventilation ! Oh ? Was today a costume party ? Don 't complicate the situation . Mikuru-chan . Sit down here . They almost look like a pair of close sisters . She probably just wants to turn her into a maid with braids . In the end it was what you would call an ordinary day . We didn 't know what we wanted to do . We didn 't know what we should do . We just let the clock tick by ... A moratorium sort of life . The everyday happenings of a natural world . While I did feel a bit dissatisfied when nothing was going on ... Oh well . There 's still plenty of time . And aimlessly look to the next day and repeat . But still this had its own sort of essence of the unordinary and really wasn 't too bad . As for almost getting killed by a classmate ... uninhabited world those things just don 't happen that often . That 's right . I wanted everything to stay this way . Wouldn 't anyone agree normally ? But there was someone who didn 't agree . You know who . Haruhi Suzumiya . What are you doing ? Scissors ! I need them for art tomorrow ! Okay . Just say something first next time . huh ? Incidentally do you know why people dream ? Sleep rotates between cycles of REM and non-REM stages . When the body is resting and the brain semi-active you 're in REM sleep ... This is when we dream . Kyon . Kyon ! My alarm clock hasn 't gone off yet . Wake up ! Don 't wanna . I told you to wake your ass up ! Do you know where we are ? I thought I had woken up but then I found myself in this place and you were lying down next to me . What 's going on ? Why are we at school ? Closed space . I know I was sleeping in my bed so how did I end up here ? And the sky looks strange ... Did you see Koizumi ? No ... Why ? No reason . Just asking . let 's escape from the school . We might run into someone somewhere . You don 't seem very surprised . I 'm surprised . Especially at the fact that you 're here . What is this ! ? It extends all the way around the school premises . So we can 't get out ? If you 're scared you might as well just cling to my arm . Creates more of an atmosphere . Stupid . Doesn 't seem to work . That 's what I figured . Kyon ... Look . Where are we ... This gives me the creeps . Want tea ? Don 't want any . What 's going on ? What is this ? I don 't get it . Where are we ? Why am I in this place ? And why is it just you and me ? Hell if I know . I 'm going to go explore a bit ! You stay here . I 'll be right back ! Guess that 's typical of her . Koizumi ? hello . Took you long enough . I was expecting you to appear in a more tangible form ... Regarding that ... I need to tell you a few things . I 'll be frank . This is an abnormal situation . When it 's normal closed space I am easily able to gain entry . However I could only appear in this incomplete form this time and it was only after borrowing the power of all of my colleagues . And it probably won 't last very long . The powers that rest within us are beginning to disappear . What 's going on ? Are Haruhi and I the only ones here ? Precisely . What we feared has already begun to happen . Suzumiya-san has finally given up on the current world and decided to create a new world . In other words we 're on the brink of Armageddon . What was that ! ? The higher-ups in our organization are in a state of panic . Nobody knows what will happen to our world once it has lost its God . If Suzumiya-san is feeling merciful our world may continue to exist without change . But it could also return to nothing in the next second . Why did this ... Who knows . In any case you and Suzumiya-san have completely vanished from our world . You are not in ordinary closed space . It is an entirely new dimension created by Suzumiya-san . Perhaps all the previous instances of closed space were merely practice runs . The world you are in is probably the manifestation nearest to the world Suzumiya-san desires . Though we aren 't sure what it is that she wants . who knows what will happen . Why am I in this place ? Do you really not know ? You have been chosen by Suzumiya-san . The only person from the old world Suzumiya-san truly wanted to be with . I thought that you had realized this long ago . It would appear that I 'm almost out of time . The way things look now I probably won 't be seeing you again . Do I have to live in this gray world all alone with Haruhi ? Adam and Eve . If you reproduce enough it 'll work out ? I 'll smack you . Just a joke . I would assume that you should soon see a familiar-looking world . However it probably won 't be entirely the same . Well ... If I happen to be born into the new world please look after me . We can no longer go back to the old world ? If Suzumiya-san desires it then perhaps . The possibility is slim though . As for myself I would have liked to spend more time with you and Suzumiya-san so I regret this turn of events . that 's right . I was asked to deliver messages from Mikuru Asahina and Yuki Nagato . Mikuru Asahina wanted to apologize . I 'm sorry . It 's all my fault . Yuki Nagato said to turn on the computer . I 'll be going .

Nagato ? Koizumi ? Kyon ! Something 's here ! What is that ! ? A monster ! ? right ? Maybe it 's an alien ! Or the revival of some super weapon developed by an ancient race ! Hey ! What are you doing ? Say . Do you think it 'll attack us ? I don 't think it 's anything evil . Dunno . seriously ? This weird world and that giant ... Don 't you want to go back to our old world ? We can 't stay in this place for the rest of our lives . Doesn 't look like there 's a place to eat when we get hungry . It 's kind of strange but I get the feeling it 'll work itself out . I wonder why . I 'm having fun right now . What about the SOS Brigade ? It 's the club you made . You 're just gonna ditch it ? That doesn 't matter anymore . look . I 'm having this really fun experience right now . There 's no need to go look for anything mysterious anymore ! I want to go back . I found out something after being thrown into this situation . I may complain all the time but I actually liked how my life was . Including that idiot Taniguchi and Kunikida ... and Asahina-san ... You can even include the vanished Asakura . What are you talking about ... I want to see them again . I feel like I still have so many things I have to tell them . I 'm sure we 'll see them . This world won 't be covered in darkness forever . The sun will rise tomorrow . I can tell . That 's not what I mean . I don 't mean in this world . I want to see the old them in the old world . I don 't get it . Weren 't you fed up with that boring world ! ? Didn 't you want something more interesting to happen ! ? I did indeed . Haruhi . I 've been through some really interesting experiences the past few days . You probably don 't know anything but you could say that the world is revolving around you . You just didn 't know but the world was definitely moving in an interesting direction . Nagato said ... " The potential for evolution . According to Asahina-san she was a " time warp . Koizumi treated her as " God . Then what about me ? What does the person Haruhi Suzumiya mean to me ? Haruhi is Haruhi and nobody else . I 'm not gonna use such tautology to dodge the question . But I don 't happen to have a decisive answer . Isn 't that natural ? If someone points to the classmate sitting behind you ... What is she to you ? How are you supposed to respond ? sorry . Guess that 's still dodging the question . Haruhi isn 't just a classmate to me . she isn 't the potential for evolution or a time warp much less God . Couldn 't possibly be ! Do you know what Snow White is ? What is it ... Actually ... Ponytails turn me on . What ? That ponytail you had back whenever looked so good it was criminal . Are you retarded ? The hell was that dream ! ? Freud would have a field day with this ! The most realistic dream I 've ever had ... . ? Or ... This is no longer the old world . It 's the new world Haruhi created ? If that 's the case is there a way for me to confirm that ? Yo . How you doing ? I feel miserable . I had a nightmare last night . I ended up not getting any sleep . I 've never wanted to skip school as badly as I do today . really ? Haruhi . What ? Looks good on you . I must be grateful to you . It looks like I won 't be out of a job just yet . we can 't discount the possibility that this world was newly created last night . In any case I feel privileged to meet you and Suzumiya-san again . I 'll see you after school . You and Haruhi Suzumiya disappeared from this world for two and a half hours . How many others like you are on Earth ? Many . Will another one like Asakura attack me ? Don 't worry . I won 't let them . Kyon-kun ! I 'm so glad I could see you again ... I thought you 'd never be able to return to this world ... Asahina-san . We ... We mustn 't ! If Suzumiya-san sees us like this it 'll happen all over again ! I don 't understand what you mean ! Asahina-san . right ? H-How did you know ! ? I never knew it was shaped like a star ! Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-When did you see it ! ? What are you people doing ? Mikuru-chan . right ? Come on . Time to change ! Stop struggling ! Resistance is futile . you 'll be a nurse . A nurse ! A nurse . Or do they say hospital attendant these days ? Doesn 't matter . It means the same thing ! Let 's talk a little about what happened afterwards . I finally turned in the paperwork for chartering the SOS Brigade into the student council . The save the world by overloading it with fun . Haruhi Suzumiya 's Brigade would definitely be rejected so I arbitrarily changed the name to the support the student body by overworking to make the world a better place Student Service Brigade . The city-wide " magical mystery patrol " is also going strong . Today would be the second occurrence . By some freak coincidence ... and Koizumi were all suddenly unable to go . So I 'm waiting for Haruhi myself . I arrived an hour before the meeting time . Because the person who arrives last ... regardless of whether that person 's late or not . Is the scowl on her face lamenting the low attendance or lamenting her failure in arriving after me ? I 'll have plenty of time to ask later . While Haruhi treats me at the cafÃ© . In fact I have a number of things I want to talk to her about . Like what kind of activities she has planned for the SOS Brigade . etcetera etcetera . when it comes down to it . I already know what I 'm going to tell her first . for now ... and espers .

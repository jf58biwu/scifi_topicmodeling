 Of all the people for the toasters to grab , it had to be Jammer . That little frak could give us all up . Jammer may be a pain in the ass but he 's no traitor . He 's not going to talk . Well , I hope you 're right about him , for all our sakes . This is so frakked up . I am so completely frakked . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) ( DOOR OPENING ) Sorry to keep you waiting . Have a seat , Mr. Lyman . What the hell am I doing here ? I haven 't done anything . Please . Can I call you James , or do you prefer Jammer ? They weren 't supposed to cuff you . Totally unnecessary . I apologize . You 're going to tell me why I was arrested ? You 're not under arrest . I brought you here because I wanted to talk about what happened at the temple .

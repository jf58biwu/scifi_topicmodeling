 This is entry number four . When two or more of these forces are proximate , They amplify exponentially Like a kind of gravity or magnetism .

But there are more pressing matters to discuss . That film that you retrieved , It 's brought everything into focus . I discovered the truth about my destiny . Our destiny . Give me charlie . Sorry . Not yet . There 's a nice sharp axe right over there . Go on . Freeze time . Chop me into bits . No , that 's right . You can 't .

Actually , i can 't . She moved all the way across campus . I 'm sorry to hear that . And that 's my fault , isn 't it ? It 's okay . It wasn 't gonna work out anyway . So i guess it 's official . I 'm a social pariah . And i haven 't helped things much . I want to make it up to you , Starting with a real bennet family thanksgiving dinner - Turkey , trimmings , the whole thing . What do you say ? And since when do you cook ? Well , you know , i 'm learning as i go . Is that a yes ? I don 't know . Is lyle coming ? No , he sends his regrets . He can 't get away from school .

Wow . - Of all the supermarkets In all the towns in all the world . It 's great to see you . You too . Well , what are you doing in washington ? Well , after primatech exploded , I was kind of unemployed . Cia seemed like the obvious choice . Ah . - You ? Um , you know , a little bit of this , a little bit of that . All right . - Mostly that . I got a place in dupont circle . Nice . What brings you to this side of town ? These yams . These canned yams . I love them , and i can 't get ' em anywhere else . Huh . Hmm , didn 't peg you for a yam man . Oh , yeah , big yam man . You 're stalking me , aren 't you ? Yes , but i am also cooking thanksgiving dinner For my daughter and my ex-Wife . Ex-Wife . Yes . Sandra left me . Can 't say as i really blame her , But we 're still on good terms . I mean , hence the oversized bird . Are you having thanksgiving on christmas ? Because this frozen beast is not gonna thaw until tomorrow . You need one of those already-Cooked birds . Oh ... okay . Follow me . Thanks . I appreciate it . 'Cause i 'm not exactly an expert In life skills . How many people ? Four . Five , if you would like to join us . That is , if you don 't already have plans . And by the way you 're sizing up My single-Serve turkey pot pie , You 've already surmised that i don 't have plans . It would be great to catch up . Happy thanksgiving . Mom , what are you - - Mm-Mm-Mm . Please , set up in there , boys . What is this ? Where 's your brother , honey ? That 's a good question . - Ah . Would you please put these in a bowl for me ? We need to talk . - Yes , i know . That 's what thanksgiving 's all about . Just families sharing our lives . Thank you , gentlemen . Okay , and please remember to stir some milk into that . That 's the way your brother likes it . I went to a storage unit yesterday , mom . Rented out to you . Saw nathan 's dead body . Rene told you about that . Well , it was not your brother 's body you saw . It was a shape-Shifter posing as your brother . It 's the worst kind of identity theft . And he had to be stopped , And then we had to store him away discreetly . You can imagine if the press had gotten wind . Matt parkman also said that ... Matt parkman said what ? Officer parkman is unbalanced . Suicidal , last i heard . Because sylar 's in his head ? Is that right ? What did you do , ma ? Is my brother really dead ? Answer him , mom . We 'd all like to hear that one . Happy thanksgiving , Nathan . So if you two will just help me set the table , We will sit down like a family And we will discuss everything . Ow . Let go of me , nathan . Answer him . It 's thanksgiving , and you are my family . And we will sit down like a family As we do every year , or i will leave here , And you will never hear from me again . Your choice . Hello . - Hey . Happy thanksgiving . Mm . - Come on in . Something smells good . Look at this place . Are you sure this is your apartment ? We clean up good . So what can i get you ? Some sparkling cider ? No , i 'm all right , but before everyone gets here , I do want to talk to you about something . Okay , just let me check the gravy first , okay ? Oh , i got that . Claire , you remember Lauren ? She worked with me at primatech . Uh , hi . Hi . You 're all grown-Up . You look beautiful . It 's okay . I 've got this , wolfgang . Thanks . Does mom know you brought a date ? No . No , no , no . Lauren 's not a date . She 's an old friend . She 's helping me cook . She is so a date . You should have told mom . Your mother will understand . We 're a complex , modern family . And she 's got doug . So what did you want to talk about ? Hold that thought . Mm . Hi . - Mr . Muggles . Hey . Happy thanksgiving . You too . - Good boy . - Hey , noah . Happy thanksgiving . A host gift . - Oh , thanks , doug . Come on in . Hi . - Hi . How are you ? Good . - Good . Who 's your little friend ? Dame Penelope Jean lovegood iii . But you can call her ms . Lovegood . Can 't she , snookums ? Yes , she can . Yes , she can . Claire , you remember doug . Yeah . Hi . Enchante . Dinner 's ready , everyone . You hired a cook ? No , that 's lauren . Wow . Mistaken for a domestic . That certainly breaks the ice . Lauren gilmore . It 's nice to finally meet you , sandra . Okay . Uh , let 's eat . You brought a date ? No . That 's lauren . Okay . Who 's hungry ? Got lots to eat . Come on . Not a fan of thanksgiving ? I 'm from japan . We celebrate kinro kansha , not thanksgiving . What 's the matter , hiro ? You can talk to me . We 're family . I 'm not part of this family . I 'm a prisoner . - No one 's a prisoner here . Samuel broke his promise . I fixed the past , but he won 't give me back charlie . He 's a liar and an evil man . If the time traveler fixed the past , where 's joseph ? That 's a good question . You got a minute , hiro ? Come inside . We need to talk . Tell me , what did you do When you fixed the past for samuel ? Oh , i 'm sorry . I cannot say . Samuel might get mad , and charlie 's at stake . I understand . I have to change for dinner . You stay a minute , will you ? You know , hiro , We can help each other . I could use my ability . Really ? I can be inside of your soul . We can be as one . Oh , painted lady , I think you are trying to seduce me . But you should know my heart belongs to charlie . I 'm sorry If i 'm making you uncomfortable . I can help you . But i need contact , Closeness to make this work . Of course . Every ability has a different set of rules . I can feel what you feel , hiro . Touch me . You want charlie back desperately . Yes . And now Samuel 's forcing you to work for him . Why didn 't he have you save his brother joseph ? Huh ? I don 't know . You should ask samuel . He 'll never tell me . You need to take me back . Eight weeks ago , when a man from the government Came to the carnival and murdered joseph . No , i don 't think i should - - Please . I need to know the truth . Oh , no , you made us time travel . We must go back . Is that the man that killed joseph ? No , that 's dr . Suresh . We need to talk . - Joseph ? I 'm behind on my chores . Forget the chores . This is not good . All right , brother . But not here . Is this it ? Is this the night that joseph gets murdered ? I don 't know . But it is very dangerous to be here . We must go before we step on a ... Butterfly . Okay , mom , you got us here , sitting , just like you wanted . So talk . Peter , where are your manners ? Nathan , would you please say grace ? No . It 's thanksgiving , nathan . It 's the one day we should express our gratitude . What do i have to be grateful for ? I 'm dead . He knows it . You know it . Why don 't you tell us why and put us all out of our misery ? Tell us . I don 't expect you to understand Or approve of the decision i made , But i hope you can keep an open mind And not condemn it . Sylar was gonna kill the president , And you two had flown off to stop him At that hotel in washington . And i had a dream about you , nathan . I saw you fighting for your life . I also saw matt parkman save you . But i panicked , And i went and found him , and i dragged him to the hotel . But by the time we got there ... I was already dead . I made matt parkman do it . This is the part where i ask you to forgive me . So that body that we saw ... That was nathan . Technically , yes . But , as far as the world is concerned , Nathan is still alive . - Yeah , but i 'm not me . It 's your mind . They are your memories . You look exactly the same . You are nathan petrelli . You are my son . You 're peter 's brother . And it 's been this way for months . And just because you know the truth , Nothing has to change . We are still a family . To us . I would like to propose a toast To all of you for being here On this , my first thanksgiving in this apartment , My first thanksgiving i 've ever hosted . I ... And that 's especially to lauren . Without her , We would all be eating japanese takeout right now . Cheers . Lauren . So Sandra , how did you and doug meet ? Mm , well ... May I ? - Please . It was love at first sight . For mr . Muggles and ms . Lovegood , that is . We met at the groomer . My little angel wouldn 't stop barking Until they put her cage Right next to his , am i right , sandy ? It 's true . Nasty . Uh-Uh . Dougy 's allergic . Legume-Intolerant . So how did the two of you meet ? Well , lauren and i used to work together At primatech . And we-We recently reconnected . Yeah , this morning , actually . Frozen food aisle . I troll the place for eligible men . Primatech . Is that the paper company or that other thing ? Oh , you know about that other thing ? Yes , dear . A memory can be erased only so many times . So you worked closely then ? Well , it wasn 't like that , you know . Or am i stumbling onto something That i 'm not supposed to remember ? You 're not stumbling onto anything . I think we should all just enjoy our thanksgiving dinner . You know , in my family , on thanksgiving , We used to go around the table And everyone would say what they were thankful for . Okay , i 'll go first . I am thankful for the two beautiful women in my life - Ms. Lovegood and my beautiful sandy . Aw . Nice . Okay . Um , i am thankful that my daughter claire Decided to come for thanksgiving . It would not be the same without her . I 'll second that . I 'm thankful for canned yams . How about you , claire ? Um , i know that i should be thankful , But i 'm just not feeling it right now . Is everything okay ? Her roommate moved out . Oh , why on earth would she do that ? You 're so likeable . Doug , you don 't know anything about me . Claire . What ? You want to talk about it right now ? Fine . I 'm thinking about dropping out of school . My family ... This will surely be A thanksgiving to remember . Where 's lydia ? Not really sure . Amanda , sweetheart , where 's your mother ? I think she went to go find the japanese man . Did she now ? Happy thanksgiving . That man from india , he wasn 't writing a book . He wanted to talk about me . You sent me away , but i stayed , I listened , i heard everything . How long have you been lying to me , huh ? You need to calm down , brother . Then stop controlling me . Stop manipulating my emotions . Fine . You want me to let go . I will . My whole life , you 've kept me under your thumb . Why ? Because you 're dangerous , Samuel . What 's that supposed to mean ? - Oh , never mind . No , tell me what you meant . You can move the earth , Samuel . But it 's more than that . Cities . Mountains . You have the power to kill millions . I can 't let that happen . I always thought i was missing out On something , Some untapped potential . Just tell me how . How can i be that powerful ? No . I 've already said too much . You think i wanted this life ? You had to be controlled . From the day you were born , I gave up everything to watch over you . Let me free you of that burden . Show me the film . Let me learn what i am . Take responsibility for myself . Too late . I told dr . Suresh to burn it . Why would you do that ? You can never know the truth . I 've made arrangements . A man from the government is coming To take you in . I gave him a compass . You 've betrayed me . My entire life , you 've betrayed me . I 'm still your brother . I love you . Joseph . No , no , no , no . Oh , joseph . Oh , god , what have i done ? What have i done ? He 's coming . I know that you guys are freaking out , But i don 't think college is where i 'm supposed to be . Is this about gretchen ? Because that is one relationship . Yeah , it is about gretchen . And it 's about becky , And it 's about everything that 's happened . Who 's becky ? Mom , look , i just don 't think That i belong in college . And where do you think you belong , Or have you even thought about it yet ? Maybe i 'll go for a year abroad . Maybe i 'll go backpack through europe . A job . I just need to find somewhere where i fit in , Where i could be myself . And the $ 40,000 i just gave to the school , Where do you think that should go ? I don 't know , dad . Where 'd it come from ? This is about what that guy samuel said , right ? Who is samuel ? What is going on ? Maybe it is . How could you even consider listening to him ? What is happening ? What did your father do ? This is not about dad . It 's about me . I can 't lie anymore . I 'm a freak , and people don 't like freaks . Can i just interject something here ? All : no ! I think that we should all just take a deep breath . All i was gonna say is that what claire is feeling Is perfectly normal . I mean , we 've all felt like we didn 't fit in At one point or another in our lives . Heck , growing up and discovering i had a penchant For dog breeding , you think i had any friends ? Uh-Uh . Trust me , claire , this will all blow over . Really ? Is it , doug ? Do you think that this is going to blow over ? What are you doing ? Both : claire ! Aw , jeez . How 's that for normal ? Great . Get more wine . I have to tell them . - No . You can 't say anything . If someone finds out i took you to the past , I will never see charlie again . I have something special . I 'll be right back . Please . - I 'm sorry , hiro . But we have to stand up to him . Some things are just too important . Where you been , friend ? Oh . I got lost . Well , now you 're found . Something going on over here ? No . Something in your hair . Hmm . Well , then , you must be starved . Hiro , join me . Make yourself useful . Pass the chair , will you ? Guess he 's never seen her regen before . So some dinner , huh ? - Par for the course . Especially when it comes to my ex-Husband . I don 't know what 's going on between him and claire . Well , i don 't know either , But i think that thanksgiving dinner was just his way Of letting claire know that she has a family That loves her . Nothing wrong with that . I thought you gave up all this . Yeah , so did i . And then i come across this compass , Which almost gets me killed . It turns out it belongs to the strange man Who shows up in my daughter 's dorm room Threatening the normal life she so desperately wants . Well , maybe it 's impossible . Maybe i 'm just not supposed to have a normal life . It sounds like you 're giving up . Why did you cut yourself ? I don 't know . Maybe because you guys all think that you know What it 's like to be me , but you don 't . How could you possibly ? I have to lie to everyone . Otherwise , they faint . I know that it has been hard , And i know that i have caused you pain , But i 'm concerned about you , claire . These are not good people . They 're dangerous . You just have to trust me on this . Would you stop treating me like i 'm a child ? Then stop acting like one . Let me get this . Sorry i 'm late . Hey , come on in . Who 's ready for pie ? Is there a problem , mom ? Some family . You look at me , you don 't see your son . You see the man who killed your son . Don 't be silly . You don 't see your brother . Well , that 's because i 'm not your brother . Nathan . Guess again . Oh , god , sylar 's in there with you , isn 't he ? We never should have gone to texas , pete . Nathan . Nathan ! Nathan . It feels good to finally be me again . What 's for dinner ? I 'm starved . You know what makes this meal truly special ? It 's knowing that each and every one of you Had a hand in making it happen . Just as we 've had a hand in each other 's lives , In our shared destiny . Uh . Heaven . We have depended on each other for so long . Through good times and bad . But tonight we should be especially thankful . The future is here . And it will be greater than my brother joseph Could ever have imagined . But i can 't tell you about it yet . Not while there 's a traitor in our midst . I just learned that the person who killed my brother Is here , Sitting at this table . It 's time we all knew the truth , Isn 't it ? Tell them , samuel . You murdered joseph . The time traveler saw it . Really ? Is that what you saw , hiro ? I 'm sorry . I have to think about charlie . I didn 't see anything . - We know what you did . Why so angry , edgar ? Is it because you 've done something shameful ? You killed joseph , didn 't you ? You betrayed us to the government . And when joseph found out , you killed him . You lying bastard . What have you done ? I saved your life . Look . Thanks . I 'm gonna finish him . No , you can 't hurt him . He 's the only one who knows where charlie is . He killed joseph . I know , but this is not the time for revenge . Sometimes a hero has to run away To live to fight another day . We will defeat him . I promise you . I 'll hold you to that . Only the guilty turn tail and run . Edgar is gone . Good riddance . Mm . I feel like i haven 't eaten in months . Mm . You think that 's some kind of existential soul thing ? You have a soul ? Come on , buddy . That 's the best you got ? No big speeches about hope ? Triumph of the human spirit ? Why don 't you let me out of this chair and find out ? And you ... You have raised the evil incarnate bar To an entirely new level . Thank you ... For giving me something to strive for . All this talk of souls and spirits Sends my head spinning . I am not a religious man . But there is one thing i do believe in . Blood . Time to carve the turkey . Get away from her . What 's happening ? It 's nathan . He 's in there . Come on , fight him , nathan . Come on , fight him . Nathan 's dead . No , he isn 't . He 's still in you . His spirit and his mind Are fighting for his family . Nathan ! Come on , nathan ! Nathan ! Nathan . Nathan , fight him . What have you done to me ? Nathan ? - Thanks . - Oh , i 'm so sorry . It 's okay . So my dad called you ? - Yeah , well , he said you were feeling low , And he knew i was feeling low , so ... How 's your new roommate ? Fine . Dull . Actually , it 's awful . No one 's tried to kill me for days now . And she 's a slob . Well , you know , The other side of the room is still available . Sorry . You 're right . I don 't know why you would ever want to move in with me again . - Maybe because of all the people that i 've met in college So far , you 're the only one who 's ever made any sense to me . Now see , i told you you were gonna have fun . What do you think about christmas ? How about a movie ? Much better . Should i give you my number , or were you just planning On stalking me in the produce aisle ? Uh , canned goods i think it was . - My home number is on the back . Use it . Happy thanksgiving . - You too . Good night , ladies . Nice meeting you . Both : bye . We 're leaving , claire . Happy thanksgiving . Bye . Sorry about doug . He 's fine . I told him he ate a peanut . He 's not the sharpest tack , but he 's a good man . Never a dull moment , noah . Not if i can help it . Thank you . - Bye . Bye-Bye . I 'm gonna go wait in the car . Thanks for the invite , mr . Bennet . Anytime . I guess " i 'm sorry " doesn 't begin to cover it ? No , it 's not your fault . I 'm just - I know , i know . You 've got a lot to figure out . I just want you to take your time and really think About your choices , claire , because you do have choices . You 're absolutely right . So you 're going back to school ? Yeah , classes start monday , And i will be there . That 's great news . Mm . Love you . - Love you . And thank you for inviting gretchen . I wasn 't overreaching ? No , it was actually the perfect dad thing to do . Next thanksgiving , your place . It 's a date . Hey . Ready to head back ? Actually , no . We have a couple days off Before classes start , And i want to find out where this leads . Where 'd you get that ? I stole it from my dad . He said i had choices . And i want to know what they are . And this is going to lead me to ' em . A compass ? Okay . - You up for an adventure ? It 's okay if you 're not . I understand . I mean ... We might run into becky there . Oh , yeah , she 's not one of my favorite people . But you are . So which way ? Take a right . You saved edgar . How honorable . Of course , when you betray me , You put charlie in danger . Your brother was right . You are powerful . But i am powerful too . I 'll make it so you never see her again . You won 't do that . You still need me . So you tell me exactly when And where charlie is , or i am leaving . And you will be the one who is lost . I like this . Little man standing up for himself . But you don 't actually think i 'd ever let you leave , do you ? You don 't have a choice . I always have a choice . How do you feel , hiro ? What have you done ? I 'm gonna find him , And i 'm gonna bring him back , mom . It 's over . It isn 't possible anymore . The one thing i know , the one thing i can count on Since all this started , is that anything is possible . It 's sylar . Nobody wants him dead more than me . You want to know what i want even more ? My brother alive . I 'll find a way .

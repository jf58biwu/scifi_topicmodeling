 ( Lucy , Narrator ) / n my / / fe , / ' ve seen New York C / ty under fu / / quarant / ne . The M / dwest , overrun , devastated by pests . P / agues sweep across Ca / / forn / a . And then what happened next was someth / ng none of us saw com / ng . / t became a race aga / nst t / me to save our future , to even have a future . / t 's the year 2100 and / surv / ved . ( VO ) To change the future , f / rst you have to / mag / ne / t . 'Earth 2100 " starts now . The idea that within this century , perhaps in your lifetime , our civilization could lie in ruins seems unbelievable . But according to some of the world 's leading minds , that 's notjust a worst-case scenario , it 's a real possibility . Good evening , I 'm Bob Woodruff . Over the next two hours , we 'II take you on ajourney into a world thatcouId await us and our children . 370,000 babies will be born today . And we 've taken the liberty of creating one more , a fictional characterwe 're calling Lucy , who will be our guide through this century . Her life story is not a prediction aboutwhatwiII happen , but what might happen . ( Lucy ) Th / s once g / or / ous c / ty , whose / / ghts at n / ght cou / d be seen for m / / es , empty now . / ts tower / ng skyscrapers , once a testament to our / ngenu / ty , now stand as crumb / / ng monuments to our dem / se . Maybe only artists can grasp what that kind offuture really holds for us . It 's perhaps in the area thatwe think of today as science fiction , but that could be a very real future forthe planet . A hundred years from now , if New York is abandoned , I can imagine some advanced creatures , maybe humans , maybe extraterrestriaIs , looking at New York and saying , those ignorant people , how on Earth could they have ever expected to survive ? ( Lucy ) / can ask myse / f what happened , but where do / beg / n ? W / th the droughts , the fam / nes , the p / ague ? / t began / ong before a / / that . / / / ved through / t a / / . My story / s everyone 's story , the story of the / ast century . ( Lucy ) / was born June 2nd , 2009 . C / v / / / zat / on was at a crossroads . We were / n a race for our future . ( Barack Obama ) Today , / say to you that the cha / / enges we face are rea / . They are ser / ous and they are many . ( VO ) The temperature / s expected to keep go / ng up . ( VO ) The stock market p / unged . ( VO ) Doug / as County w / / / run out of dr / nk / ng water . ( Barack Obama ) They w / / / not be met eas / / y or / n a short span of t / me . ( VO ) S / xth grader came down w / th suspected sw / ne f / u on Wednesday . Energy , climate , food , population , economic pressures , any one of these challenges might be very serious in itself . But because they 're happening all simultaneously , it 's going to be very difficult for our governments to cope . When I Iook at the next century , I feel it 's up for grabs . - ( VO ) Ra / s / ng sea / eve / s ... - Catastroph / c weather . - Ten-year drought ... - / t 's scary . These are th / ngs that are happen / ng today . The t / me for act / on / s now . ( Lucy ) The wor / d had never known such uncerta / nty . We were used to hav / ng what we wanted and do / ng what we wanted . The analogy that I would draw is someone looking at their bank account and week afterweek , they 're withdrawing money and they 're enjoying the good life . If they would botherto read the statements , they would see that the bank account is dropping $ 900 , $ 800 , $ 700 , $ 600 . And at that rate you know that another six months of the good life is not gonna be a good life anymore . We 've acted as though we were independent ofthe environment . We burned fossil fuels . We 've overused our renewable resources in the belief thatwe could do that forever . people are complaining about the economic crisis we have right now . You haven 't seen nothing yet . You know , if we continue down this suicidal pathway thatwe 're on , where we basically turn living stuff into dead stuff and call that economic growth , this will look like the good old days . ( Lucy ) A / though the wor / d / was born / nto was runn / ng out of so much , water , o / / , / and , / remember a / ov / ng fam / / y , a b / g house , green / awn , more water than we knew what to do w / th . My parents must have known what was happen / ng . We had a compact car and recyc / ed . And / t wasn 't just us . Smart , / mag / nat / ve peop / e everywhere were work / ng fur / ous / y on so / ut / ons . Our government was pour / ng money / nto a / ternat / ve energy . / t seemed / / ke everyone was grow / ng the / r own vegetab / e garden . windmills were sprouting up all over . Peop / e were beg / nn / ng to understand . But the c / ock was runn / ng out , and nature was a / ways one step ahead . flowers are blooming earlier and trees are leafing earlier . Birds are coming back from migration much earlier . If you were to pull back from the Earth , what you would see is sort of a refugee movement , if you will . And species are moving their ranges farther north to get to cool , from south to north , and from the valleys up to the mountain tops . ( Lucy ) Of course , as a ch / / d , / d / dn 't not / ce these th / ngs , hav / ng noth / ng to compare / t to . / was a / / tt / e g / r / enchanted by my sma / / wor / d . Unt / / one summer , thousands , maybe m / / / / ons , of dragonf / / es showed up out of nowhere . They were de / / cate and beaut / fu / and / put one / n a jar . My mother was puzz / ed and / ooked them up . They were supposed to be / n Cuba , not M / am / . / t was not unt / / much / ater that / rea / / zed they were a s / gn of what was to come . It 's 2015 , six short years from now , and the best-Iaid plans are getting underway . Awave farm off scotland is harnessing the ocean 's energy . vatican City has gone totally solar . And here in America , cars are running cleaner and more efficiently . still , we cling to that old habit , oil , and it 's getting harder and more expensive to find . ( VO ) From coast to coast , motor / sts are search / ng for re / / ef from soar / ng gas pr / ces / n Ca / / forn / a ... We could see a doubling ortripIing of real oil prices , that 's after inflation . We 're running out of oil and we 've created a society , the American way of Iife is what we call it , based on the assumption that oil will be plentiful forever . The large spread out suburbs that we 've grown accustomed to , the strip malls , the big box stores with theirenormous parking lots around them , all of those have been made possible because we 've had cheap gasoline , and as energy becomes much more expensive , you 'II see that those areas become less desirable places to live . ( Lucy ) The f / rst t / me / moved , / was s / x . A / ot of peop / e were / eav / ng the suburbs for the c / ty . There were new jobs , and you d / dn 't need a car for everyth / ng . My dad was go / ng to work on the new streetcar system / n M / am / . And my mother to / d me we were go / ng to / / ve on the top f / oor of an apartment bu / / d / ng . She sa / d we 'd see the pa / m trees be / ow us . / was exc / ted , but a / so a / / tt / e sad to / eave . ( VO ) As the pr / ce of o / / goes up , / t w / / / r / pp / e through every part of the g / oba / economy . ( Reporter ) / n Wash / ngton today , protesters demanded an end to r / s / ng food pr / ces . Our agriculture system is almost wholly dependent on cheap oil . Tremendous amounts of diesel fuel that are used in planting and harvesting and then moving the stuff , all these vast distances . By 2015 in the United States , add about 20 million people to the population and thenjust play outwhat that does to consumption patterns . I mean , the , the number of people that we 've got to feed . There 'sjust basically this slow , creeping tension for natural resources . ( VO ) As the Amer / can way of / / fe becomes / ncreas / ng / y unsusta / nab / e , the rest of the wor / d w / / / be try / ng to catch up . The Chinese like cars . And they like big cars . You have 14,000 cars out onto China 's roads daily . Incomes are rising really rapidly . They 're moving into meat-based diets . You need 10 pounds of grain to get one pound of meat . There is simply no way that the rest of the world can start eating meat the way we do . ( VO ) / f everyone / n the wor / d consumed as much as the average Amer / can , / t wou / d take the resources of four Earths to support the p / anet 's popu / at / on , wh / ch ra / ses the quest / on , shou / d the rest of the wor / d consume / ess , or shou / d we ? Amer / can hab / ts , though , are hard to break . We in the US have gotten used to the idea that we 're somehow immune to natural limits and it 's the other people who are going to suffer . ( Reporter ) Good morn / ng , M / am / . The summer of 2015 / s on track to become one of the hottest / n h / story . Temperatures are expected to be / n the tr / p / e d / g / ts . ( Lucy ) My mother and / were wa / t / ng for gas . The / / ne went around the b / ock and then some . Noth / ng new . But th / s t / me , the / / ne had stopped mov / ng a / together . A man who worked at the gas stat / on came out ho / d / ng a s / gn . Peop / e started ye / / / ng and they got out of the / r cars and started mov / ng towards h / m . My mother got us out of there fast . ( V / dographer , Ma / e ) / ' ve been stak / ng out an area that 's been h / t hard recent / y by gas snatchers . Look at h / m , he gets out , wa / ks r / ght up to the car . Wow . Look at th / s , r / ght / n the m / dd / e of the day . There 's cars go / ng by , and these guys are - s / phon / ng gas out of someone 's car . ( Reporter ) / n the face of mount / ng protests over r / s / ng gas and food pr / ces , Congress today approved a p / an to fund the construct / on of 40 new coa / - f / red power p / ants over the next f / ve years . ( Lucy ) The country took the easy way out . Coa / was once aga / n touted as our so-ca / / ed sa / vat / on . But the more coa / we burned , the faster our p / anet warmed . You get the p / cture . We 're spewing more carbon , more methane , more nitrous oxide into the atmosphere . AII the bad things of climate change are coming true . ( Lucy ) And most peop / e werejust go / ng a / ong w / th the / r everyday / / ves as / f noth / ng had changed . And until we have a crisis of some kind , I don 't think we 're going to be motivated to wake up and say , okay , now we have to change . Sometimes it takes a big shock to get people , you know , out of the inertia that , that , that 's built into the system . ( Reporter ) They 're ca / / / ng / t the storm of the century , Hurr / cane L / nda pack / ng Category 5 w / nds . ( Lucy ) B / g storms weren 't unusua / . But th / s one was b / gger than the others . And / t was headed for M / am / . ( Reporter ) A / / coasta / reg / ons are be / ng evacuated . Th / s storm makes / andfa / / , we 're go / ng to see a tremendous storm surge . ( Lucy ) My mother was a nurse and she wou / dn 't / eave unt / / a / / the s / ck were evacuated from the hosp / ta / . My father was afra / d we wou / dn 't get out / n t / me . / was afra / d too . ( Reporter ) Those who make the dec / s / on not to evacuate face / / fe threaten / ng danger , between the how / / ng w / nds and those g / ant surg / ng waves . M / am / / s a very scary p / ace to be r / ght now . ( Bob Woodruff ) 2015 / s on / y s / x years away , but many experts say that / f the wor / d has not reached an agreement to mass / ve / y reduce greenhouse gases by then , we cou / d pass the po / nt of no return . If we 're still dragging ourfeet in 2015 , it really becomes almost impossible forthe world to avert a degree of climate change thatwe simply will not be able to manage . The Iongerwe waitwithout addressing these challenges in an aggressive way , the more likely it is we 're going to end up with really bad outcomes . ( Repoter ) Th / s morn / ng , / n the aftermath of Hurr / cane L / nda , we are see / ng the f / rst / mages of what rema / ns of M / am / . ( Reporter ) Ne / ghbor / ng commun / t / es have been overwhe / med by hundreds of thousands of evacuees seek / ng refuge . ( Lucy ) The evacuat / on center was as b / g as an a / rp / ane hangar . Maybe / t was an a / rp / ane hangar . And sojammed w / th peop / e , / t was hard to move . / t was hot . / t was no / sy . We were there three weeks . There was nowhere for us to go . Nowhere for anybody to go . We watched the news on TV . / was on / y s / x , but / t / ooked to me / / ke the who / e wor / d was / n troub / e . ( Repoter , ) Some 250,000 Bang / adesh / refugees f / ee / ng from / ast month 's devastat / ng cyc / one are mass / ng on the / nd / an border . ( Reporter , Ma / e ) Thousands r / ot as Ch / na faces / ts worst wheat shortages / n a decade , the resu / t of seem / ng / y end / ess drought . ( Reporter , Fema / e ) Wor / d / eaders are gather / ng / n Wash / ngton , DC to attend an emergency g / oba / summ / t meet / ng . ( Reporter ) Hopes are h / gh that the wor / d m / ght f / na / / y reach an h / stor / c c / / mate agreement . This is the first time the whole planet is in that kind of a crisis and the whole planet has tojoin in meeting a crisis of epicaI proportions . ( Bob Woodruff ) / n 2008 , the Center for the New Amer / can Secur / ty , a Wash / ngton th / nk tank , staged an e / aborate game . The goa / was to s / mu / ate a g / oba / summ / t on c / / mate change . The year / s 2015 . The context for the game / s Lucy 's context . M / am / has been devastated by a hurr / cane , and Bang / adesh ravaged by a cyc / one . The peop / e who are p / ay / ng the ro / es of g / oba / / eaders are / n fact h / gh / eve / po / / cymakers from around the wor / d . ( John Podesta ) Let me be very clear , ourtime is running out . ( Bob Woodruff ) John Podesta , Pres / dent Obama 's trans / t / on ch / ef , / s p / ay / ng the ro / e of UN Secretary Genera / . Indeed today , in October of 2015 , no country , no city is exempt from the ravages of climate change as we saw so tragically with the Category 5 hurricane that hit Miami . ( Bob Woodruff ) / n the game , the Secretary Genera / has asked for a 30 % reduct / on / n em / ss / ons by 2025 . The US team ho / ds a c / osed-door strategy sess / on . It 's very important for us to strike that very positive leadership tone right out of the box . We have to be much faster and more serious about emission reductions . We need to do 30 % . - By 2025 ? - By 2025 . ( Woodruff ) But there 's a strong d / sagreement about whether the Amer / can pub / / c wou / d be w / / / / ng to make that k / nd of sacr / f / ce . basically , the odds of a 30 % reduction in the United States in 10 years is zero . The world is going to hell in a hand basket and we 're saying , gee , can we stretch this out ? ( Woodruff ) Even / f the Un / ted States were w / / / / ng to make these reduct / ons , th / s / s a g / oba / cr / s / s that needs g / oba / act / on . The US ca / / s a meet / ng w / th Ch / na . We have an inherent responsibility to our people to take action . / n 2015 , Ch / na and / nd / a are / n fact projected to account for more than 30 % of the wor / d 's carbon em / ss / ons . But / n the s / mu / at / on , they 're unw / / / / ng to agree to a treaty they fee / / / m / ts the / r econom / c growth . For both countr / es , the / ssue / s fa / rness . The Western countries went through a very energy intensive development process , became rich by burning coal and burning oil . Can countries like India and China do it without burning as much fossil fuel as the West ? We have to go greener . You have the technology and you have the capital and you 're prepared to help us grow on a greener path . Ch / na and / nd / a say they w / / / agree to the cuts / n greenhouse gas em / ss / ons on / y / f the West hands over the techno / ogy needed to do so . China would wish to get the technology forthe third generation of nuclear power plants . But Europe and the US refuse . The techno / ogy be / ongs to pr / vate compan / es . / nstead , they offer to he / p pay the costs of sw / tch / ng to c / eaner energy . You do the emissions reduction , and we give the money for the emissions reduction that you 've done . If - somebody , you know , you have the money but you do not have the technology , and then you cannot reduce any emissions . The who / e summ / t h / nges on whether they can come to an understand / ng . So we 're not putting any pressures . We 're just offering , and I think it 's a good offer . We do not accept the offer . ( Repoter ) The p / anet summ / t broke down today when Ch / na and / nd / a refused to agree to cuts / n greenhouse gas em / ss / ons . ultimately , all the teams fell short . That perhaps is the , the saddest element coming out of this , which is the pace of changejust doesn 't seem to be in keeping with the magnitude ofthe challenge . ( Bob Woodruff ) Sc / ent / sts say that / f th / s / s how our / eaders respond / n 2015 , the ent / re p / anet w / / / be at r / sk . If we continue on the business-as-usuaI trajectory , there will be a tipping point that we cannot avert . We will indeed drive the car overthe cliff . ( Lucy ) There was a story my mother once to / d me / ' / / never forget . You put a frog / n a pot of co / d water and turn the heat on . The water warms so gradua / / y that the frog doesn 't not / ce . / t never rea / / zes the prec / se moment / t 's cooked . The frog will sit there because it 's not able to detect the small changes in temperature that are making his life increasingly dangerous . And we 're in the same sort of situation . We 're so adaptable in our evolution as a species , an adaptability that 's allowed us to really , in a sense , conquer nature and conquerthe world . Butat this point , that adaptability is actually a real threat to our existence . ( Lucy ) As / grew up , / t became / ncreas / ng / y c / ear that we were the frogs . After our home was destroyed by the hurr / cane , my fam / / y moved to San D / ego . Maybe because / t was as far away from M / am / as we cou / d get . ( Repoter , Fema / e ) F / na / / y , th / s even / ng , sav / ng our seas . The federa / government has re / eased a major assessment on the oceans . The news / s not good . / t 's go / ng to be tough to dr / ve th / s summer . Gas pr / ces are expected to soar even h / gher . ( Reporter , Ma / e ) / ncreased heat speeds up evaporat / on cyc / es . / n fact , these changes can be seen wor / dw / de ... Sc / ent / sts report from the Arct / c the tundra / s thaw / ng faster than expected . ( Reporter , Fema / e ) The Un / ted Nat / ons announced today that there are now e / ght b / / / / on peop / e / / v / ng on Earth . ( Lucy ) / t 's amaz / ng what you can come to take for norma / . By the t / me / was / n my 20s , shortages and h / gher pr / ces were just a fact of everyday / / fe . After h / gh schoo / , / dec / ded to tra / n as an EMT . / wanted to be usefu / , and th / s seemed the perfect k / nd of work . So what else will be normal in 2030 ? One thing , itwiII be warmer , about one and a half degrees Fahrenheitwarmer . Enough to dramatically aIterthe planet 's weatherand rainfall . Canada and Siberia , for example , will be wetter and hotter . Butfor much of the world , rain will be scarce . And so will its most basic need , water . By 2030 , two-thirds of the world 's population will be underwater stress . ( Bob Woodruff ) / n As / a , for examp / e , g / ac / ers on the T / betan P / ateau act as a g / ant reservo / r for b / / / / ons of peop / e . AII overthe world , as the climate warms , mountain glaciers are melting at faster and faster rates . By 2030 , 80 % of those g / ac / ers may be gone . / f the g / ac / ers d / sappear , much of the food supp / y w / / / d / sappear , as we / / . These glaciers provide stream flow in the summer during the dry months that you can use to irrigate your crops . When those glaciers are gone , you 've got a massive drought situation . / n 2030 , Afr / ca cou / d be fac / ng extreme and w / despread drought . rainfall levels are gonna continue to drop over time in Africa , especially in these fragile regions , Iike the sahel . When the rains fall and people don 't have enough to eat , they often turn to desperate means to survive . ( Bob Woodruff ) And / n the US / n 2030 , many of the mass / ve reservo / rs fed by the Co / orado R / ver w / / / be dry / ng up . We talk about the Southwest moving into drought as , as a way to , to describe what 's gonna happen . ButtechnicaIIy , the Southwest , it 's not gonna be in drought , it 's gonna become a desert . ( Lucy ) / n San D / ego , they were ahead of the game . / n 2009 , they had started bu / / d / ng huge desa / / nat / on p / ants . / t took 20 years and cost b / / / / ons of do / / ars , but / t worked . The mass / ve p / ants on the ocean turned sa / twater / nto fresh , and the c / ty 's water supp / y was restored . 400 m / / es / n / and , though , they were runn / ng out . And no one had enough money to bu / / d a p / pe that / ong . So now , we 're here rationing water I mean , people who are in Las vegas are starting to totally panic . people in Phoenix are starting to panic , too . When I turn on my tap this morning , this is what I get out of my tap . Something thatwiII catch people 's attention is the first city , rich city in the world , thatjust runs out of water . ( Repoter , Fema / e ) Three days after Tucson 's taps ran dry , / ts parched res / dents f / na / / y got re / / ef when a convoy of Nat / ona / Guard tanker trucks carry / ng one m / / / / on ga / / ons of water f / na / / y arr / ved . Anx / ous res / dents / / ned up to get the / r a / / otment . ( Lucy ) What happened there scared the who / e country . / n San D / ego , when the pr / vate compan / es who desa / / nated our water used Tucson as an excuse and jacked up our water pr / ces , / dec / ded enough was enough . / went to a ra / / y . A man stand / ng next to me saw me ye / / / ng and sa / d , " / ' m g / ad you 're on our s / de . " To make a short story even shorter , we fe / / / n / ove on the spot . Two months / ater , Josh and / were marr / ed . A year / ater , our daughter , Mo / / y , was born , w / th a head fu / / of red ha / r . And the desa / / nat / on compan / es , they backed down . We had won . Josh and / had fr / ends who , / / ke us , were determ / ned to re / mag / ne the future . We were a / / of us opt / m / sts . Some of us worked on so / ar p / ants / n the desert . Others t / nkered w / th super eff / c / ent cars / n the / r garages . St / / / , others des / gned fantast / ca / c / t / es on the / r computers . / t was an exc / t / ng t / me to be young . But / t was becom / ng c / ear that the prob / ems of the wor / d knew no borders . ( Reporter , Ma / e ) G / oba / popu / at / on / s now approach / ng n / ne b / / / / on . Seems unlikely to me that we here in America can sit happily with all of our resources while the rest of the world simply goes quietly into that good night . very few people lay down and die . When they recognize that their lives are threatened , they do whatever it takes . ( Reporter , Ma / e ) Hundreds of thousands of env / ronmenta / refugees f / ee / ng drought and fam / ne are stream / ng toward Europe . They will move across borders by the droves , by the millions . And thatwiII be something we 've never seen before . And that might be the thing thatwe would find the most difficult to cope with . ( Reporter , Fema / e ) From Laredo to T / juana , m / / / / ons of Lat / n Amer / cans are mass / ng a / ong the US border . You 'II see intense pressure for people to move and be on the move from the Caribbean , from Latin America , from Mexico in particular , into the United States . And that 'II put huge stress , I think , on , on the systems in the United States to try to cope with that . I can 't imagine the horrors that will take place on the border as millions of refugees try to get into the United States . ( Lucy ) / was work / ng the m / dn / ght sh / ft when a ca / / came from the border po / / ce . 'Be carefu / , " Josh sa / d . " Th / s doesn 't sound good . " Thousands of refugees had been arr / v / ng at the border desperate for water and food . Someone had b / own a ho / e through the wa / / , and thousands of peop / e were stream / ng through . They had ca / / ed / n the border po / / ce . / don 't know how / t started , who f / red f / rst . But sudden / y , the po / / ce were shoot / ng / nto the crowd . There were peop / e fa / / / ng , pan / c everywhere . Josh heard / t on the news . And how he found me / n the m / dst of a / / that chaos / ' / / never know . / n San D / ego , Josh and Mo / / y and / took / ong wa / ks on the beach to / ook for b / rds . Over the years , our favor / tes started to d / sappear . The worst was the end of the a / batross . These marve / ous b / rds had f / na / / y been done / n by f / shermen 's / ong / / nes . / t was a bad omen for the rest of us . probably a third of all species will be on an inexorable path to extinction by 2015 . They will include familiar species , Iike Iions and tigers and bears , but there will also be huge areas of the planet , which presently are really lovely and beautiful and diverse . Those places will have essentially disappeared . ( Bob Woodruff ) / n the h / story of the Earth , there have been f / ve mass ext / nct / ons , / n wh / ch at / east ha / f the spec / es on Earth d / sappeared . They were caused by natura / d / sasters , mass / ve vo / can / c erupt / ons , rap / d c / / mate change , meteors h / tt / ng the Earth . Today , / n the 21st century , we are / n the m / dst of what sc / ent / sts are ca / / / ng the s / xth ext / nct / on . And for the f / rst t / me , / t / s be / ng caused by a s / ng / e spec / es , us . When one species proIiferates beyond any other , ultimately , it sort of knocks out its own life supportsystems and it collapses . And in a way , that 's what we 're doing at every level around the world . ( Bob Woodruff ) Today / n 2009 , the / dea that we cou / d do so much damage to our natura / env / ronment that / t cou / d cause our g / oba / c / v / / / zat / on to co / / apse , may seem farfetched . Think of all the signs of normalcy . Water is still coming out of the faucet in my kitchen . The electricity still turns on . I buy food at the supermarket . It seems inconceivable that our modern world could collapse . Every society that collapsed thought it couldn 't happen to them . The Roman Empire thought it couldn 't happen . The Maya civilization thought it couldn 't happen . The Byzantine Empire thought itcouIdn 't happen , but it did . And it usually creeps up on you unforeseen . ( Bob Woodruff ) At / ts peak , the Maya c / v / / / zat / on numbered more than 10 m / / / / on . They had astronomy . They had the only writing in the new world . They had great art . They were the biggest game in town . They are the equivalent of us in their , in their era . These city centers were supporting 25,000 to 50,000 people . So , they were very well adapted to their , their surroundings they were able to grow . But they grew too much and exhausted the / r resources . Growing population , meaning growing the demands on the land , deforestation and soil erosion , which tied into warfare . There was chronic warfare among the Maya city states . ( Bob Woodruff ) And then , the c / / mate sudden / y changed . There were these series of extended droughts . And those droughtsjust kept hammering away and hammering away . You lose yourforest . You lose your soil . If you lose your soil , you can 'tgrow anything . And if it stops raining , then forget about it . The endgame for the Maya must have been horrible indeed . It 's highly likely there were also periods of starvation . It 's a truly hideous and ugly way to die . ( Woodruff ) The Roman Emp / re faced many of the same prob / ems that we face today . Itwas kind of a precursor of our globalized economy . / n just a few short centur / es , Rome bu / / t an emp / re that stretched across three cont / nents . As it expanded , the requirements for simply feeding its cities and feeding its army , it became so large that the empire couldn 'tgenerate enough food energy , enough grain , to adequately meet all its obligations . So , there was a constant fiscal crisis and financial crisis . ( Bob Woodruff ) As resources ran out , the / r emp / re co / / apsed . The city of Rome itself went from a million people down to perhaps 30,000 , and thatwas the largest city in Western Europe at the time . civilizations in the past have lost the fight . I mean , they , they have collapsed as a result of the inability to deal with several different events going on at once . And so , you know , I think the takeaway is that , honestly , we 're not that special . ( Bob Woodruff ) Easter / s / and , one of the most remote p / aces / n the wor / d . / t 's hard to / mag / ne that a c / v / / / zat / on once thr / ved on such a barren / s / and , but / t d / dn 't a / ways / ook / / ke th / s . Easter island used to be covered by a forest of dozens of tree species , including the biggest palm tree in the world . ( Woodruff ) But as the / r popu / at / on grew , so too d / d the / r demand for wood . As they gradually cut down more and more trees , the trees didn 't grow back rapidly enough to replace the trees thatwere being cut down . So , some time in the 1600s , the Iast tree was cut down . You saw all of the classic signatures of collapse . The population plummeted . There was starvation . And essentially , they turned to cannibalism . The question is , whatwas that person on Easter island thinking when they chopped down the Iast tree ? The pattern / s c / ear . ( Bob Woodruff ) C / v / / / zat / ons that grow too / arge and consume too much damage the / r own / / fe support systems . As resources run out , they beg / n to f / ght each other over what / / tt / e / s / eft . Then , they e / ther starve or / eave . But / n our case , where can we go ? I think Easter island is the perfect metaphor because it 's this small , fragile island sitting within the Pacific Ocean , it 's very remote , and , and it no Iongerwas able to sustain the population that lived there . It 's no different than Earth being this small planet in a vast galaxy . Think about that cartoon movie that was made about the beatles music , 'YeIIow Submarine . " There was a creature in it . " YELLOW SUBMARINE " Hey , look who 's back . full speed ahead . Its head is a funnel that functions as a vacuum cleaner . suddenly , it 's run outofthings to pointat , there 's nothing left . So , it 's looking around for something . And finally , it looks down , sucks itself up . And then , we have a blank screen . Here we are . The moral of that story , by grabbing everything in sight , we 'II end up destroying ourselves . And by 2050 , the population is exploding , the rainforests are disappearing , and nine billion of us competing for ever scarcer resources . A bad situation made worse by widespread drought and huge migrations of people . Life is changing for everyone , including Lucy . ( Lucy ) My parents both got s / ck the w / nter of 2050 . / t was a horr / b / e f / u that year . / t seemed the v / ruses were gett / ng worse each pass / ng season . / kept them comfortab / e . And / ' m g / ad they were at home and together when they d / ed . After that , there was noth / ng to keep us / n San D / ego . Josh and / dec / ded / t was t / me to / eave . We were exc / ted . Josh had been offered an amaz / ng job / n New York work / ng on the sea barr / ers des / gned to protect the c / t / es from the r / s / ng seas . There wasn 't much room / n the truck . We took c / othes , a few books , and 50 ga / / ons of water . Everyth / ng e / se we / eft beh / nd . ( VO ) GPS 2100 . P / ease se / ect your dest / nat / on . New York C / ty . Ca / cu / at / ng safest route . ( Lucy ) We headed north across the Mojave Desert . By dusk , we were on the outsk / rts of Las Vegas and greeted by m / / e after m / / e of abandoned suburbs , and acres of go / f courses turned to dust . The s / / ence was eer / e . well , by 2050 , Lake Mead , one of the great reservoirs of the Southwest on the colorado River has finally gone dry . There 's not enough water to meet human needs . ( Lucy ) Peop / e / n Las Vegas had depended on Lake Mead for a / most a / / the / r water and power . Las vegas , I would imagine , is gone . With a drought like that , you 've got a city in - in the desert . And it 's gonna be really difficult to live there . ( Lucy ) When we got c / oser to the Str / p , we were / ucky to hook up w / th a convoy headed east . Las Vegas was a strange s / ght . Most of the hote / s dark . A / / those neon / / ghts gone dead . S / n C / ty had pretty much fo / ded . From there , we drove through Ar / zona . Daybreak . R / s / ng out of the desert , we saw someth / ng wonderfu / . These huge , new so / ar p / ants . 50 square m / / es of ref / ectors . They hadn 't been bu / / t soon enough to he / p Las Vegas , but one day , they were supposed to power the who / e West Coast . / t was comfort / ng to know . There 's tremendous possibility there in the desert Southwest . There 's a capacity to produce solar power and , and move it to where the great population centers of the United States are . ( VO ) The safest route headed east today / s Route 40 . I think itwouId be almost impossible to do thisjourney unless you had some form of intelligence as to what areas are lawless or dangerous . I don 't think strangers are gonna be very friendly . ( Lucy ) By the t / me we got on to Route 15 , we were gr / my and t / red . The scene / n front of us had jo / ted us out of our daze . Hundreds of peop / e packed the road . A / / of them stream / ng out of the Southwest head / ng north . / t fe / t / / ke the Dust Bow / a / / over aga / n . Think what it wouId be like if we had millions of neighbors to the south heading north because of , they don 't have food and they don 't have water . They shouted at us as we drove past . Mo / / y was ha / f out of the w / ndow , catch / ng everyth / ng w / th her camera . Sudden / y , a man grabbed her arm . He had a gun and po / nted / t at Mo / / y 's face . 'Get out of the truck r / ght now , " he ye / / ed . / ' d never been so terr / f / ed . But w / th / n seconds , two men from the convoy pu / / ed the / r own guns and the man me / ted back / nto the crowd . We knew now just how dangerous the border reg / ons had become and how / ucky we were to be headed east . Just as peop / e were m / grat / ng , so too were the bugs . / n Ok / ahoma , acres and acres of corn were threatened . To the degree that all ecosystems are extremely stressed by 2050 , pests will flourish . There 's an arms race between breeding crops that are resistant to various pests and the pests themselves , because to the degree that we simplified ourfood system , we 've also made it massively vulnerable . For decades , th / s had been pred / cted . These g / ant farms , wh / ch supp / / ed so much of the wor / d 's food , were easy prey . people get their seeds from single orjust a few manufacturers , and they 're genetically very , very similar . So , if in fact an agent were to come onto the scene thatwas capable of infecting one , itwouId rapidly spread . Ha / fway through Kansas , we sp / / t off from the convoy . They were headed north to Canada . We went east to Greensburg , Kansas , / eav / ng the devastat / on beh / nd . ( VO ) We / come to the Greensburg V / s / tor Center . / n 2007 , a tornado destroyed our town . Out of the rubb / e came a dream . ( Barack Obama ) A town that was comp / ete / y destroyed by a tornado / s be / ng rebu / / t as a g / oba / examp / e of how c / ean energy can power an ent / re commun / ty , how / t can br / ng jobs and bus / nesses ... ( Lucy ) Th / s was a wonderfu / p / ace , comp / ete / y se / f-susta / n / ng . They had been one of the f / rst , and they knew what they were do / ng . They got the / r power from the w / nd and sun , the / r water from the ra / n , and they grew everyth / ng they ate . Fee / / ng a / ot better , we hot seated / t the rest of the way . Compared to the Southwest , the f / e / ds were green and fert / / e . We saw some commun / t / es / / ke Greensburg . We w / shed there were more . The c / oser we get to the end of ourjourney , the better we fe / t . The next day , we h / t the outsk / rts of New York C / ty . ( VO ) New York C / ty / s engaged / n the greatest urban exper / ment of our t / me . Skyscrapers that grow the / r own food , to an a / / - e / ectr / c veh / c / e f / eet , to c / ean and tranqu / / parks . / nsp / red / eaders and creat / ve m / nds are work / ng together to create an urban parad / se . ( Lucy ) / / ooked across the George Wash / ngton Br / dge at the sky / / ne and fe / t a surge of hope , but underneath ran a tr / ck / e of worry . W / th a / / we had seen , maybe we had seen noth / ng yet . ( Lucy ) By the m / dd / e of the century , / thought / ' d seen / t a / / . Storms , m / grat / ons , and droughts that had destroyed who / e c / t / es . But / had a / so seen so much more . Br / / / / ant peop / e everywhere were work / ng fur / ous / y to change our future . / had a fam / / y , and together , / thought we m / ght be equa / to whatever came out way , but / had no / dea of what the future wou / d ho / d . It 's a new world . And not a better one , as we catch up with Lucy , ourfictionaI storyteller . The year is 2060 , past mid-century and into middle age for Lucy . At 51 , she has grown up in a world of soaring population , dwindling resources and intense climate change . The worst case scenario imagined by some experts is playing out . But there are signs of hope . A growing global movement led by cities like New York . New York is probably the most geographically favored city in America . Great port . Rich fisheries around it . This wonderful riverthat allows transport and access to great farmland . It 's a center of the arts . It 's been a center of finance . I think itwiII continue to be so . ( Lucy ) After what we had been through , New York was a fresh start . The c / ty was fu / / of hope and energy and prom / se . You 'd wa / k down the streets and meet each other 's eyes and see a sense of purpose . / t was a great p / ace to be a part of back then . The f / rst years we were there were the best of our / / ves . Josh was work / ng as an eng / neer on the Great Barr / er Project . / was at Be / / evue Hosp / ta / , a h / stor / c / nst / tut / on a / ready more than 300 years o / d . The bu / / d / ng we / / ved / n was green / n every sense of the word . And Mo / / y worked / n the gardens that grew our food . They were a part of the bu / / d / ng / tse / f . You 're going to see greenhouses , muItistory greenhouses . And each floor will be growing , you know , carrots and potatoes , etcetera . And thatwiII be justconsidered normal . The bu / / d / ng supp / / ed not just our food , but most of our own energy . Instead of having solar panels , big heavy bulky things , we can just put this thin film on rooftops , on window panes and generate electricity thatway . / rode my b / ke to work every day , a mere 30 b / ocks . We had des / gnated b / cyc / e / anes . The traff / c was manageab / e , and you cou / d breathe the a / r . A / / the veh / c / es were e / ectr / c . You hook your car up to a mega transport system . ItwiII move you a good bit of the distance to yourfinaI destination . Kind of a train of cars . And then you get disconnected from the mass combination transit and drive the Iast little bit yourself . ( Lucy ) Mo / / y fe / / / n / ove as qu / ck / y as her parents had . She marr / ed George , who was study / ng to become a botan / st . A year / ater , my grandson Dan / e / was born . And a / ove / / er ch / / d / had never seen . / t was a happy t / me . And when Mo / / y to / d me they were mov / ng upstate to work on a rea / farm , Josh and / understood . / t had a / ways been the / r dream . The c / ty was gett / ng a / ot of attent / on . And money f / owed / n , both pr / vate and pub / / c . The b / ggest and maybe the most / mportant project was my husband Josh 's . S / nce w / thout the barr / ers , the c / ty was at r / sk . / t wou / d be the b / ggest c / v / / eng / neer / ng project / n US h / story . Be comparab / e to putt / ng man on the moon . ( Lucy ) The project had been under way for years , and those who worked on / t had a tremendous sense of pr / de . There was three barr / ers go / ng up . One at the Verrazano-Narrows Br / dge , one at the top of the East R / ver . And one / n Staten / s / and at Baton H / / / s . You cou / d see them r / s / ng a / / tt / e every day . Sea / eve / was r / s / ng . And w / thout the barr / ers , b / g storms wou / d f / ood the c / ty . I think it wouId be like in medieval times , people building a beautiful huge cathedral . Took generations to build . And there was a great sense of purpose , and gave purpose and meaning to life . ( Lucy ) The project drew thousands of peop / e / nto the c / ty / ook / ng for work . New York C / ty was then , as / t had a / ways been , a beacon of hope . New York , it will be a magnet as any viable city will be a magnet . These cities where people come to flee become petri dishes for diseases and new diseases and resistant forms of disease . There are a number of infectious diseases that are currently confined to tropical and subtropical areas . They 're likely to spread into temperate zones . And this is something that I 'm very concerned about . ( Lucy ) Keep / ng New York safe from d / sease was cruc / a / . And Be / / evue was busy . / d / dn 't fee / as t / red at end of the day as / m / ght have . We were do / ng / mportant work . Keep / ng a c / ose eye on any new d / seases . / remember the n / ght / was ca / / ed to the worker 's camps / n F / ush / ng . A young Ecuador / an fam / / y had just arr / ved / n New York . And they a / / had h / gh fevers . And b / / sters on the / r hands and feet . We sprung / nto act / on / mmed / ate / y , c / osed off the ne / ghborhood , and ca / / ed / n the CDC . They knew r / ght away they were / ook / ng at a new v / rus . We set up a mob / / e c / / n / c at the camps , where we treated dozens of workers and the / r fam / / / es . Everyone recovered . And the d / sease was conta / ned . Imagine now the year 2070 . Things are in danger of unraveling . Sea levels have risen nearly three feet , redrawing the map of the world . island nations have disappeared . Much of bangladesh reclaimed by the sea . Some of california 's famous beaches gone . The florida everglades , underwater . Now , the richest countries are being forced to come up with innovative and expensive solutions . Lucy 's husband , Josh , is one of the leaders . ( Lucy ) Josh was an eng / neer on the Great Barr / er Project . After 30 years / n the mak / ng , / t was near / ng comp / et / on . W / th / n a few months , they wou / d be test / ng the mass / ve gates . If I was the engineer in charge , I would be very nervous . But you would have practice runs . And during nice weather , you would say , all right , Iet 's close the gates today and make sure everything 's working right , it 's not going tojam up . ( Lucy ) Josh was worr / ed about someth / ng e / se , too . New York C / ty 's barr / ers , / / ke others around the wor / d , had been bu / / t on the assumpt / on that sea / eve / r / se wou / d be gradua / . But / t was becom / ng c / ear that m / ght not be the case . ( Reporter ) Sc / ent / sts say they are detect / ng a mass / ve sp / ke / n the / eve / of methane / n the atmosphere . climate in general doesn 't change smoothly the way , you know , we 're used to seeing projections from climate models . We find that the transitions from warm to cold or cold to warm , some of those transitions can be really , really abrupt . Abrupt meaning within the time scale of a decade , or sometimes even less than a decade . ( Lucy ) We knew there were certa / n th / ngs that cou / d rap / d / y turn up the heat . But we d / dn 't know what that t / pp / ng po / nt wou / d be unt / / / t happened . Maybe the tipping point is you heat up the tundra and the permafrost so much thatthere 's a huge burp of methane and carbon dioxide out of those northern soils . Methane is a big worry in my mind because it 's some 20 to 30 times more potent than CO2 . ( Bob Woodruff ) An enormous reservo / r of methane , produced by decompos / ng p / ants and an / ma / s , / / es bur / ed beneath the frozen arct / c tundra . / t has been there s / nce the / ce Age . / f the tundra thaws and a / arge quant / ty of the gas / s re / eased , g / oba / temperatures wou / d soar . This is a bit like a light switch . You push the light switch a little bit and nothing happens . You push a little bit more and nothing happens . Then you push it a little more and it flips completely to a new state . ( Reporter ) The methane emanat / ng from the arct / c cou / d ra / se temperatures wor / dw / de .

Imagine that you are the president of the United States , and you have word that GreenIand is going to collapse in the next ten years , adding seven meters to sea level . I 'm not saying that is happening today . I 'm saying imagine thatwere to happen , and you were told that technology exists to stop it . WouIdn 'tyou be tempted to use it ? ( Lucy ) / t d / dn 't take / ong for the wor / d to agree . A techno / ogy ex / sted that cou / d stop the / ce sheets from me / t / ng . / t shou / d be used . Hundreds of jets from a / / around the wor / d were spray / ng a m / st of su / fur d / ox / de / nto the atmosphere . The gas wou / d form part / c / es wh / ch wou / d shade the Earth and temporar / / y coo / / t . This is your solution of last resort . You say all belts are off , we arejust going to intervene in this system with reckless abandon . For a year , there were these spectacu / ar sunsets . But what are the other consequences of those things ? Maybe it wouId cool the Earth , maybe itwouId cool it too much . That might be a disaster in the opposite direction . Maybe itwouId cause some other environmental problem thatwe don 't foresee today . ( Lucy ) The Earth coo / ed . But that was the / east of / t . ( Reporter ) Ton / ght / n Wash / ngton , there 's debate on whether to fo / / ow Ch / na and Great Br / ta / n and cease f / y / ng cosm / c sh / e / d m / ss / ons .

( Reporter , Fema / e ) The Surgeon Genera / test / f / ed before Congress today on the hea / th effects of further ... ( Lucy ) The c / oud was burn / ng off the ozone / ayer . Once that was gone , every / / v / ng creature wou / d be exposed to a mass / ve dose of rad / at / on . The exper / ment was ha / ted . Once they stopped spray / ng the gas , the / ce sheets cont / nued to me / t , but now at a qu / cker pace . Sea / eve / r / se wou / d soon be measured / n feet , not / nches . If you end up with several meters of sea level rise , you change life as we know it . ( Reporter ) / n New York , watchdog groups are now suggest / ng storm surge barr / ers may be too / ow . ( Lucy ) Josh and the other eng / neers were work / ng around the c / ock to try to bu / / d the barr / ers even h / gher . But we a / / knew we were / n a race aga / nst t / me . Society is not set up to deal with rapid sea level rise . It would be a catastrophe of - a magnitude we 've never experienced . One of our political leaders said not too long ago that the American way of Iife is non-negotiabIe . We 're going to discoverthe hard way thatwhen you don 't negotiate the circumstances that are sent to you by the universe , you automatically get assigned a new negotiating partner named reality , and then itwiII negotiate for you . You don 't even have to be in the room . ( Reporter ) A v / c / ous nor 'easter / s headed up the East Coast . / t / s expected to h / t New York on the h / gh t / de th / s afternoon .

( Lucy ) And then one day , the powerjust went out . The phones , the / nternet , the who / e data network went down . Some sa / d / t was a terror / st . Others thought / t was the f / ood / ng . Sudden / y no one knew anyth / ng for sure . If communication breaks down , rumor becomes the communication system and a mob psychology takes over . collapse is not something that actually happens overnight . It 's the result of an accumulation of stresses , an erosion of the internal strength of society , so that itjust becomes like an eggshell . And one last shock breaks it . ( Lucy ) Loot / ng was rampant . Most of the po / / ce force deserted . The mayor was nowhere to be found . We wa / ted for the Pres / dent or the Nat / ona / Guard to appear . But no one came . That 's when / t dawned on us that the government , / / ke so much e / se , had fa / / ed . If the world breaks down , if globalization breaks down , then even the capacity of the United States to kind of manage a degraded global environment I think will come into question . What we 'II see is the federal government being viewed as something not to be taken seriously anymore . ( Lucy ) Reports were sketchy , but here 's what / know for sure . The v / rus cont / nued to spread . / nd / a and Ch / na had gone to war over water and who knew what e / se . M / / / / ons were dy / ng from fam / ne . The human race was co / / aps / ng under / ts own we / ght . By that time , I will guess thatwe will be seeing a substantial die off ofthe human population . Most of civil society will have degenerated . ( Lucy ) / was 75 when / wa / ked across that George Wash / ngton Br / dge . There were no check po / nts anymore . / / eft w / th a coup / e of fr / ends and a dog who had adopted me . Rosy , / ca / / ed her . She never / eft my s / de . But where was / go / ng ? / d / dn 't know / f Mo / / y was st / / / a / / ve . Let a / one st / / / on the farm up north . / d / dn 't know / f / had a grandson anymore . But that was my hope , that / cou / d somehow f / nd them or they me . Afew hundred years down the line , they 'II look back and say the Dark Ages began in the 21st century . Our c / ty , beaut / fu / c / ty , was abandoned . And nature took over qu / ck / y . As / t a / ways has . The breakdown would be rather rapid . The flooding of Manhattan would have a real destabilizing effect . The subway tunnels would flood and they would stay flooded . The columns that hold up the streets , they 're steel , they will rust , they will corrode . The streets above them start caving in , and Iow and behold , we have surface rivers once again in Manhattan . Nature has that momentum , you see . Take the thing back . practically become like ajungIe . From the asphaItjungIe to the reaIjungIe . Your big skyscrapers here are well anchored into Manhattan schist . On the other hand , they weren 't designed to be water logged . Itjust takes one hurricane to hit New York . buildings are going to start to get taken out . ( Lucy ) And / t wasn 't just the c / ty . Our who / e way of / / fe had crumb / ed . But / found my daughter Mo / / y , and Dan / e / , my grandson . He was a young man now . Mo / / y 's husband George had been k / / / ed . Both of us were w / dows now . / t / s a hard / / fe . The Un / ted States / s fragmented / nto a m / / / / on chards . We 're a / / cut off from each other . Each protect / ng what / / tt / e we have . ItwouId be a wrenching transition , it wouId be a catastrophic transition . It 's something we don 't want to experience . The Dark Ages were called the Dark Ages for a reason . I fearthatwe 'II see a world like medieval Europe where you have feudal states fighting forwhat remains of a source of water , a source of energy . ( Lucy ) We managed to produce our own power and commun / cate over rad / o waves . The c / t / es that have endured are now wa / / ed fortresses . Jea / ous / y guard / ng whatever rema / ns of the computer age . I 'm picturing enclaves of affluence and wealth , but surrounded by vast masses of people who will be barely surviving . In effect , humanity could very well be in hell . Where hell is defined as truth realized too late . We have had to re - / earn what we had un / earned centur / es before . How to / / ve off the / and . How to make do . I think we 'II see a world in which literature , the arts , democracy , those will disappear , largely disappear . How much of the wonderful scientific breakthroughs of the 20th and 21st century will still be retained ? If it 's some eIectronic-based thing , itcouId all be lost . ( Lucy ) My grandson Dan / e / m / ght never hear a symphony , go to co / / ege , or read the books / read . He w / / / never marve / at a r / ght wha / e , the beauty of a cora / reef or a spotted ow / . You ever actually get outside and just kind of look at the wonder of the world , - it takes your breath away . And I think to think of a world where somehow that is taken away , is really sad . We 're going to leave a planet that is so desperately beaten up that itwill probably take hundreds ofthousands of years to get it back , to restore it . We will have lost so much of our natural heritage . ( Lucy ) / can teach h / m poems and songs . / can te / / h / m what / saw and what / / earned a / ong the way . / can try to te / / h / m what / s prec / ous . What / s prec / ous ? / ought to know that . They say / am the o / dest woman on Earth . W / th age / s supposed to come w / sdom . What / s prec / ous ? Th / s Earth of ours . Th / s garden we must tend . These peop / e we / ove . Lucy 's story is a worst case scenario of whatcouId happen if we continue on our current path . It 's a wakeup call , a challenge for us to plan a different course . But our experts say we must act immediately . Where did Lucy 's world go wrong ? What can we learn from their mistakes ? We turn back the clock now to show you a vision of a future we can still create . There 's a future out there that 's a much presentfuture than the present thatwe 're living in right now , to be sure . If we took the measures we should take , 2100 would be at the beginning of an era that we , today , would regard as paradise . We have a chance to get it right , to move from a disconnected inefficientworId of fighting populations , to a sustainable planet . The problem we face today is how do we get from here to there ? ( Bob Woodruff ) The wor / d that Lucy was born / nto / s our wor / d today . There are p / enty of s / gns that / t 's / n troub / e . But there are hopefu / s / gns as we / / . The problems thatwe face , water , soil , climate change , they 're all problems caused by humans . So we 're capable of solving those problems . It could be overwhelming if we let it . I just try to take it one brick , one chunk at a time . I think that 's how you have to deal with it . ( Bob Woodruff ) So what shou / d we do r / ght now to chart another course ? How do we avo / d end / ng up / n Lucy 's wor / d ? Many experts say the f / rst step shou / d be transform / ng how we use energy . Much of what we need to do we a / ready know . plant a garden . Use compactfIuorescent bulbs . More mass transit for people . insulate your homes . smaller cars . There 's no simple solution , but 100 % of the Earth 's population doing a very small thing makes a big difference . ( Bob Woodruff ) But / nd / v / dua / s a / one won 't be ab / e to turn th / ngs around . Governments and / ndustr / es are go / ng to have to change on a mass / ve sca / e . We 're going to have to come up with more solar , more wave power , more geothermal energy . Beyond the fam / / / ar techno / og / es , amaz / ng new ones are a / ready / n the works . F / e / ds of so / ar ba / / oons that cou / d power thousands of homes a day . A nuc / ear fus / on fac / / / ty that cou / d produce the energy of a t / ny manmade star . We can 't drill and burn our way out of our problems , but we can invent and invest ourway out . ( Bob Woodruff ) Gett / ng enough of these projects up and runn / ng w / / / take peop / e . And that means jobs . And / f we can put more peop / e back to work , then by 2015 , / nstead of commun / t / es d / s / ntegrat / ng , they cou / d start to rebound . You could fight pollution and poverty at the same time . You can beat global warming and the economic downturn with the same dollar bill that you invested in green jobs , green energy , green technology . ( Bob Woodruff ) / f we start those / nvestments today there wou / dn 't be gas / / nes and f / ghts as / n Lucy 's wor / d . / nstead , there wou / d be e / ectr / c cars that cou / d run 300 m / / es per charge . But comp / ete / y redes / gn / ng our energy system wou / d requ / re rap / d change . / t wou / d mean both sacr / f / ce and hard work for the who / e country . But we have done / t before . The thing I would compare it to is world War II . After pearl Harbor , FDR turned to Detroit , the automakers , and said , you will now make tanks . You will now make Jeeps . Just like that . Thatwas like overnight almost , and they did it . ( Bob Woodruff ) And we won that war . / t 's go / ng to take that same / eve / of comm / tment . Imagine thataII of us did enough things that it made a real difference in our country . What effect does that have on China , on India , on other nations ? well , if we don 't set an example as the strongest and most important country in the world , what do we expect them to do ? They 're not going to follow if we don 't lead . ( Reporter , Fema / e ) Wor / d / eaders are gather / ng / n Wash / ngton , DC , to attend an emergency g / oba / summ / t meet / ng . ( Bob Woodruff ) A turn / ng po / nt / n Lucy 's wor / d was the g / oba / summ / t of 2015 . When the wor / d / eaders fa / / ed to agree on act / ons to s / ow c / / mate change . We do not accept the offer . They set / n mot / on a / / the d / sasters that wou / d fo / / ow . But what / f they had agreed ? ( Reporter , Fema / e ) For the f / rst t / me ever , Ch / na , / nd / a , the US and Europe have reached an agreement that cou / d avert catastroph / c c / / mate change . By tackling climate change , you end up tackling energy , you end up tackling food , you end up tackling water resources . You could change this vicious cycle I think into a virtuous cycle . Then whatwe could see is actually billions of people coming into far more stable sustainable prosperous economies . ( Bob Woodruff ) As we move forward / n the century , we w / / / see the / nvestments and hard cho / ces we made ear / y on beg / n to pay off . A positive scenario is fossil fuels will be disappearing . We 're growing more food with less water . We 've restored ecosystems . ( Bob Woodruff ) By the m / dd / e of the century , we wou / d be us / ng water and other resources much more carefu / / y . Farmers wou / d be p / ant / ng drown res / stant crops . Water wou / d be recyc / ed , and there wou / d be enough to support the US Southwest . / n 2050 , p / aces / / ke Las Vegas cou / d surv / ve . The hope / s that once we f / gure out how to so / ve these prob / ems , we ' / / be / n a much better pos / t / on to he / p the rest of the wor / d . If we can actually raise the prospects of the bottom few billion people , we actually make global stability possibility . We reduce mass migration . Refugee movements . Desperation . actually slow the population growth . And if we do all those things , wejust bring a sustainable world prosperity cIoserto hand . There 's a very good chance by about 2050 , the worst part of the crisis having passed , doesn 't mean there aren 't going to be big problems still to face . But it means that we will have avoided sailing right off the cliff . ( Bob Woodruff ) By 2100 , our wor / d cou / d be transformed . Just imagine a city that is not polluted , that has a great transportation infrastructure . stackable cars or cars that are folding and then they would charge and be a shared ownership model and you wouIdjust pull out the one that 's available that 's fully charged . Everything happens inside the city itself . That means ourfood production , ourwaste and recycling , our energy . We 're going to havejoint management of water resources , of energy resources . We 're going to be living on a pIanetwhere we don 't see things at a national level , but we see things at a global level . By the time we get to 2100 , the challenge of building a global green economy , where we 're sharing technologies , not fighting wars overwater and oil , that 's going to bring out the best in the human family . Humanity will be relatively disease free . children will be treated as rare treasures . Most people don 't realize not only can we change , we must change . And I think that 's how you own the future . That 's how you take control of your destiny . I have huge faith in humanity . We will be able to create a world thatwiII have a livable planet for our kids and their kids , that is our opportunity . That is our obligation . Kids born today will see us navigate past the first greatest test of humanity , which is can we actually be smart enough to live on a pIanetwithout destroying it . In December this year , nearly 200 countries plan to meet in Copenhagen , Denmark . Their mission , to draw up a strategy to finally come up with a global agreement to slow climate change and safeguard the planet . If you 'd Iike to Iearn more about " Earth 2100 " or if you want to get involved in the solutions , I 'm Bob Woodruff . For all of us here at ABC News , good night .

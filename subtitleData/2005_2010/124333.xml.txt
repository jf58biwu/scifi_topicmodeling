 Some call Bregna the perfect society . Some call it the heigth of human civilization . But others know better . The Goodchilds built Bregna to ensure us a future . They built The Relical . A memorial to remind us of what we survived . They built walls to protect us . They tell us that outside ... Nature has retaken the world . But the real problems lie within . We are haunted by sorrows we cannot name . People disappear ... and our government denies these crimes . The Goodchild regime provides for us ... as long as we stay quiet . So we trade freedom ... for a guilded cage . But there are rebels who refuse to make that trade . Who fight to overthrow a government that silences us . Who fight in the name of the disappeared . They call themselves the Monicans . I ... am one of them . Hello . Aeon ! We have an assignment . We want you to sabotage Goodchild 's central surveillance facility . Your entry will be noticed ... but we will breifly disrupt their interior alarms . Surveillance is their greatest tool against us . As long as Monicans can be seen ... we can be targeted . We need you to blind them . Each mission brings us closer to defeating the Goodchild regime . This is my daughter . Have you seen her ? She disappeared two months ago . Help me please , miss . She disappeared two months ago . Shopping for me Una ? Haven 't you heard ? Special occasion ! My sister 's finally coming to dinner . Claudius and I are looking forward to tonight . For once you 'll be in the house long enough to sit down . That 's why I wanted to meet with you here . Aeon . I may not make it tonight , I 'm sorry . Don 't be upset . - It 's not that you can 't come to dinner . It 's why ! You know I used to imagine you 'd come with me . We have different ways of solving problems . Yes . You ignore them . How could I possibly ignore them ? Excuse me , this is my daughter . I see the problems . I feel them . and I 'm trying to make something good out of it . A life . - What kind of life is it ? There are good things here . There 's one . So I have a surprise for you . Tell me . Tonight . So be careful . Come back . Possible Monican contact . Subject ... Identification requested . Possible Monican activity suspected . ... you can 't come to dinner . It 's why ! You know I used to imagine you 'd come with me . We have different ways of solving problems . ... make something good out of it . A life . Identification requested . Possible Monican contact . Identification requested . You 're early Claudius . They 're everywhere . We have to protect you from them . This is how Chairman Goodchild deals with Monicans . She wasn 't ... She wasn 't a Monican . I had a family once . I had a life . Now , all I have is a mission . Come back . Yes . She will see you now . Handler . - Aeon . We have an assignent . One you 've been waiting for . Goodchild ? We 've intercepted information that will allow us to penetrate his security . We want you to eliminate him . You should have sent me in earlier . That would have been suicide . - Not for me . Patience Aeon . It has taken us years to get the information we need . I know you want to do this for Una ... but you must remember this is larger than you . She 's not the only innocent person who 's been killed . This is our moment . We have never been stronger . People are frightened yes but if we show them the way ... they will rise behind us when he 's gone . I 'm ready . Tomorrow Goodchild will be preparing his address to the council . To reach the government zone you will need to cross the frontier garden . Once you are through the garden ... you must move quickly to the citidel . The underground interior has been built to be confusing . We 've implanted a route for you . Follow it . I want Sithandra with me for the crossing . Of course . Get to the forum . That 's where Chairman Goodchild will be . You know what to do from there . - Yes . Do this and you will have your revenge . We 'll all have our victory . Hello Sithandra . Still can 't surprise you . Not yet . How are the modifications ? Usefull . You should have it done . I like my shoes . Warning , end of civilian zone . Do Not proceed . Warning , do not proceed . Ready ? Always . Warning , do not proceed . Sithandra ? - Let 's keep moving . We understand these now ? Completely . I 'd keep off the grass . Rendezvous at 16 : 20 . I 'll be waiting . I agree with the policy of targeting proven Monican threats ... but I 'm affraid we 're going too far . We can 't go too far with them . There are advantages to showing a degree of leniency . We can 't allow them the luxury of hope . Not even one of them . Brute force isn 't the only option . It 's an effective one . The Monicans are growing strong ... soon force won 't be enough . So you want to compromise ? Negotiate ! The policy should be reconsidered . Put to a vote . The policy is not up for debate ! I 'm ... debating it . I would encourage you to look at this with a little more detachment Giroux . Here we must be impersonal . You wouldn 't want me to take yor outburst personally . Would you ? That is all . Oren . I getting worried about you , Oren , This edge you 've taken . Displays like that are uncomfortable to us . I believe in protecting what we 've created . I won 't apologize for that . This was created to allow me to do my work . I can 't do that if you can 't control yourself . Understood . Is it ? Yes . And what about the test results ? All negative . Sorry . Find me a new test group by morning . Maybe it 's time to give up on the tests , Trevor . We 're living the solution already . This is prefection . Why can 't you just embrace it ? - You see what 's happenng to people . You know how desparate this has become . - It can be contained . Controlled . I think you 're forgetting that this was all meant to be temporary . You 've always said that but why should it be ? Because it 's wrong . - Things change . But I know that you won 't . You know me . I 've been your brother a long time . You 're right about that . Trevor , your speech . Trevor . Useless ! State destination . Forum . Proceed forward . Proceed left . I know that you have fears ... and sorrows that shake your belief and try your patience . Now more than ever ... we must stand together ... because there are those among us ... who would tear down what we have built . The Monicans seek to divide us . We must never forget who we are . A lonely outpost in a tiny land . We 're all that remains of the people that once covered the earth . We must adapt together to these new challenges . Remember what we have faced . But we have survived . We will adapt . We have always doubted . That 's the fabric of who we are . Catherine ... It 's you . Wait outside . Aeon . You called me by another name earlier . I did ? and you let me live . Give me my gun . We 'll try it again . Maybe later . What was that name ? You know me , don 't you ? No . Do you know who you are you ? I know I came here to kill you . That 's why you 're in a cell . But we 're both still alive for a reason . I don 't know what this is . But it 's good to see you . Amateurs . Good boys . Aeon ? Little busy Sithandra . Is it done ? I need more time . Our information on him my be wrong . I don 't understand this . We have to move . I hope ... Don 't question me Sithandra . I 'll contact you soon . Aeon , you know that there will be consequences of this . I know what I 'm doing This is outrageous . One Monican eluding all of our defenses . The problem will be taken care of . The problem is Trevor 's concept of security . He needs to learn to accept more traditional ... He needs to learn to accept our input . Another example of him pursuing his own agenda no matter what we think . I 'm beginning to question his agenda . Meaning ? A Monican tries to kill him and he lets her live . An unusual choice . And now she 's escaped . Does anyone believe this is a coincidence ? Do you really think that I 'm a sympathetic ear for your complaints about Trevor ? You don 't have the right to question what he does . You must be concerned Oren . This is hardly routine . I think I should talk with Trevor . And I think all of you should be more descreet . Inari . Image retrieval commencing . What happened ? My sources were clear on this . Aeon Flux is the best the Monicans have . She failed . It 's the first time she has . I wanted this done cleanly . My brother ... will be vulnerable ... preparing his speech ... tomorrow ... 13 : 00 . It can 't be traced to you in any case . It 's comforting . We did everything correctly . She had her opportunity . And she stopped . Why ? I don 't know . Image retrieval underway . It 'll be too risky to call another hit . The Monicans may suspect they are being used . Stop . Oren ? No . That 's impossible . Claudius ! Why are you still here ? It 's not as simple as you think . Una 's murdered and you keep working for the people who did it . What should I be thinking ? You don 't know . What don 't I know ? They killed her . and you 're still alive . You killed her , Aeon They thought she was a Monican , that 's why she died . Una 's life was worth more than that . She was all I had . You 're not the only one . What are you really doing here , CIaudius ? Working . It 's all that 's left . Working ... for Trevor Goodchild . I blame him too . But now I don 't think it was Trevor 's fault Trevor is trying to help . Something is wrong with us , Aeon . With everybody . You have the dreams don 't you ? Memories of things that never happened to you ? Una had them . I have them . It 's happening all across Bregna . What is it ? I don 't know . They only tell us what we need to know . My work is a small part of a larger experiment . Whose experiment ? Trevor 's . We are studying what 's growing outside the wall . Something happened when they cured the industrial disease . Something else sprung up in its place . We 're sick ... and Trevor is trying to cure us . That 's all I know . Trevor tried to dope me . Tell me what 's in this . It 's a message . Well , what does it say ? You have to drink it . That 's how it works . I loved her . You know that . Aeon . Sorry for the pain but it 's not safe to talk in the open . Nothing is as it seems . You had your chance , why did you hesitate ? You know where to find me . Why am I here ? I needed to see you again . You killed my sister . I didn 't know anything about it . I 'm sorry . And that excuses you ? No . But this is a war . People on all sides die . She shouldn 't . She had nothing to do with this . Everyone is involved in this . She wasn 't . I don 't need that to kill you . But it would be easier wouldn 't it ? Everything changed when I saw you . I know you and you know me . Why do I know you ? Why ? Why did you come back ? What you want from me ? What do I want ? I want my sister back . I want to remember what it feels like to be a person . Aeon . Why I feel this way around you ? Catherine . You know me . We want you to eliminate him . Come back ! I 'm not who you think I am , Aeon . Something is missing here . We identified the variables that compromised test group 7A . Schedule a Relical visit regarding 7B and make sure we isolate them . It 's just a matter of time before people will look up ... and question what 's happening here . Found you . No permanent damage here Chairman . You may leave . She 's escaped . Why am I not surprised ? I found her in the library . I think I wounded her . You attacked her ? She 's a Moican agent who tried to kill you . I assumed it was obvious what I should do . Freya , I want her alive , do you understood . Is Oren aware of this ? I can 't find him . Stay close . No matter what Trevor 's done for us in the past ... he 's not above reproach . This is treason . Oren ? Trevor has been moving away from us for a long time . What we 've built here ... is larger than him . I never thought it would come to this , but we have to face the truth . He choose that Monican and he knew what that would mean . He must be removed . and Oren is next in line . Isn 't that right ? Yes . It 's done then . Mr. Chairman . Trevor has betrayed all of us . He 's a criminal . We 'll treat him as one . ... test group 7A . Schedule a Relical visit regarding 7B and make sure we isolate them . It 's just a matter of time before people look up and question what 's happening here . Review progress of subjects from test group 7B Sandran Veims , Gretta Salk , Una Flux Schedule a Relical visit to retreive new data . 8.26 7.19 Gretta Salk , Una Flux . Schedule a Relical visit to retreive new data . 8.26 7.19 Collect additional samples from Relical strands 5.88 You 're certainly killing him kindly . The situation has changed . Our orders haven 't . I 'm not following orders anymore . Why are you doing this , Aeon ? Everything has become more complicated . No , it 's simple . Trevor may not be responsible for Una 's death . Trevor ? I 'm trying to find out who is . Your mission was to kill Goodchild ... and you can 't or won 't do this so ... give me a weapon and return across the frontier . Didn 't I teach you to think for yourself ? You taught me a lot more than that . Please . I can hurt you if I have to . Don 't you feel something wrong inside you ? Sithandra I don 't know who I am . You feel it too , don 't you ? Come with me . We 'll finish the mission together . I can 't . This sort of thing used to be fun . Now what do I do with you ? Catherine . Come back . ... 07.4.872 Noted , returned to stream . 70.5.872 Noted , returned to stream . Suki Denali . 02.4.875 Noted , returned to stream . Welcome back . Una Flux . 32.4.870 Collected . Sucessfully reassigned as Sasha Prillo . Repeat . Una flux , reassigned as Sasha Prillo . Sasha Prillo ... address . Sasha Prillo . Address . Handler . - Sithandra . Goodchild is still alive . Aeon failed ? She let him live . There 's something between them . Something personal . Explain . She abandoned the mission . I tried to stop her ... and she attacked me and left me here . Are you secure where you are ? Fairly . Help is coming . Aeon flux is now considered a fugitive . She has betrayed the resistance and must be considered a threat . She has aligned herself with Goodchild and is with him now . We must move quickly . You will eliminate her . Kill her and then complete her mission . Sithandra , show them where you are . Do you see ? Yes ... Yes Yes Extricate her and proceed from there . Trevor ! It 's her . Yes . She was here . What was she looking for ? Her sister ... Una . Una Flux . Scroll down . Member of test group 7B . Show me all of 7B . Sandra Tlopiz . Member of 7B . Killed in police action . Where is she ? Gretta Salk . Member of 7B . Killed in police action . There 's nobody here . Camille Abdie . Member of 7B . Killed in police action . Una Flux . Member of 7B . Killed in police action . Who did this ? All actions authorized by Adjunct Chairman Oren Goodchild . Freya , go to my lab , find the notes on group 7B . You need to get to a safe place . There 're moving against you . Meet me there in two hours . Where are you going . I have to find her before they do . Trevor . Freya , I 'll see you at the lab . Take care of yourself . Una . You 're right . Please don 't hurt my baby . She 's safe . You cloned her . I cloned everybody . There was a complication when we cured the industrial disease . The vaccine had an unintended side effect . Sterility . Only one more generation of our species could survive . It was a desparate time . Cloning had never been used on humans successfully . But we succeded . Now when a person dies , their DNA is recycled . Oren and I built The Relical to store the DNA and to conceal the cloning process . The keeper finds a suitable couple and using food additives we induce a chemical pregnacy . When the woman comes in for an exam , we implant a cloned embryo . From there things happen naturaly . In nine months , the citizen who died is reborn . For seven generations Oren and I have cloned ourselves , taught ourselves ... so that I could keep trying to find a cure . While we all live on . That 's what we are ? Copies ? We 're more than that . It wasn 't supposed to be permanent . I 've been trying to cure the infertility . Una was part of one of my test groups . Oren lied to me . He told me her test had failed like the others . But she had become pregnant . He killed all of the subjects . Your sister included . He killed her because she was pregnant . Una didn 't know it but her baby would have been one of the first new children in 400 years . Oren 's changed . He doesn 't want to go back . He doesn 't want a cure . He wants to live forever . You must have been expecting us after helping that Monican . Your loyalty to Trevor can 't protect you anymore . I 'm loyal to something deeper than any of this . I don 't understand people like you and Trevor . Your sentimentality , your devotion to the past ... To things that are gone . I couldn 't live without those things . How can you ? Sasha . We should go . It won 't take long for Oren to find us . She 's going to be a handfull . Go . They don 't want you . Go ! Down ! You need to stay conscious . Please remain calm . We 're experiencing a technical malfunction . Please remain calm . We 're experiencing a technical malfunction . We can 't go to a Monican safehouse . Nowhere is going to be safe for us . We need to get the bullets out . Are you hit anywhere else ? Did any of them manage to miss you ? We might have to go outside the wall . I know . First , I have to end this . I need to go back in . I have to get my notes from the last test group . Oren will find the lab and destroy it . Everything I 've done . All military units should report to their stations and wait for further instructions . Who 's in charge here ? We need your help . We have orders to shoot you on sight . There 's been a coup . Your orders are coming from an illegitimate government . Stay where you are sir . What 's your name ? Sir ? I want to know your name . It 's Ord. Garret Ord. I can 't command you anymore Garret ... but neither can they . You 're free . You need to make a decision . Shoot us or help us but do it quickly . Lieutenant ? How can I help you Chairman Goodchild ? We need weapons . We need to get back into the citidel . Yes sir . Attention , please return to your homes and wait for further instructions . You will be updated frequently . This is an announcement from the Council and Chairman Oren Goodchild . Attention , please return to your homes and wait for further instructions . We 're getting closer . Wait . Trevor . The name you called me . Catherine . That was my name . You were my wife . We had a life together just like anybody else . Wait . You need to tell me . I lost you during the disease and you couldn 't be brought back . I 've lived and died seven times since then . And each time I taught myself about you . You were an idea I kept alive . Something I had to imagine . But when I saw you ... what I felt was real . I knew you . I remembered you . What we had then survived in us past death , past everything . I was looking for you . I 've been waiting . We were different people . We were . Those people are gone . But something in them came back . Yes . I remember . It 's chaos out there . There 's a coup against Goodchild . Made it easier to slip in . Did you bring a way to find her ? As long as there 's a trace of the pill in her , we can track her . No ! Freya . It 's gone . I 'd cured it . I 'd found the answer . It 's all gone . We have to keep moving . They 're still one more thing to do . There 's nothing left to do . You and I need to get out of here . We 'll go outside the wall . We 'll find a way to live . There 's one more thing to do . I need to destroy it . No . This isn 't the answer , Aeon . There 's no guarantee I can find the cure again . The cloning is all we have . It 's not enough . Our minds are unraveling and every time you bring us back it gets worse . If you do this we end . We 're meant to die . That 's what makes anything about us matter . Living like this is torture . We 're just ghosts . That 's not how I feel . Not now . Let 's be careful . You know who we 're up against . This is an empty gesture . It 's a leap of faith . It 's not for you to decide . Aeon . I don 't want to lose you again . You don 't have to . You 'll find a cure again . It 's over Trevor . Moving into position on the south spire . It goes so much deeper than your cure . Other women have been getting pregnant naturally . Outside of your experiments . More and more of them . They healed themselves . And you killed them too ? I had to stop it . How many ? How many , Oren ? It doesn 't matter . Nature 's finally found a way . In position . In position . Position aquired . Nature 's the one who 's obsolete . Not us . How can you not understand the beauty of what you made ? I do . Situation 's getting complcated . You told me she was gone . There was nothing that they could do . I ordered her DNA destroyed . You were a different man with her , Trevor . She would have stopped you from doing what needed to be done . Like she 's stopping you now . No , Oren . Yes . Waiting for the go . On my signal . This world , our world , is beautiful . Worth preserving at any cost . It can 't last . It 's falling apart . Sithandra , give us a signal . Sithandra ! - Take Flux down first . You 're wrong is this , Oren . We 've beaten death . We 've beaten Nature . We 've gone beyond you . Now I need to be free of you . Wait . Sithandra . You choose this , Aeon . It 's too late . You know how much we can set free . I 'm trying to end it and so is Trevor . We will never betray you . Help me . Sithandra . You still know me . Finish it . You can choose to trust me . Finish it . Sorry , Oren . I 'm sorry . I am too . Orders have changed , cover Aeon , cover Goodchild . Goodchild 's been hit . Flux is headed to the courtyard . Cover Aeon . Sithandra . Oren . They 're coming . Aeon . We 're waiting for your orders . You 're not part of this ? Whatever we are , we 're not anarchists . There has to be rules . Thank you . You 're the one You saved me . Yes . I knew you then . This one was corrupted . Destroy it . I knew you were important . The DNA is good . Destroy it . I knew that I needed to protect you . I kept your DNA hidden here dormant . I 've waited until now to bring you back . Why ? I knew that your strength would survive with you . I thought that if I brought you back you could reach Trevor . You always could . I have to end it . Yes . Start over . What about you ? I 've waited four hundred years for this day . I 'm tired . Stay alive , Aeon . You are needed . Look ! Now we can move forward ... to live once ... for real ... and then give way ... to people who might do it better . Hey ! Catherine ! Will I see you again ? To live only once ... but with hope . The End

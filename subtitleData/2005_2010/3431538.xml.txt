 Any ship , Raptor 7-1-8 , please respond . Any ship respond . Any ship , Raptor 7-1-8 , please respond . Any ship respond . - I entered the coordinates right . - Godsdamn him Cap . - Jump us back . - They 'll leave a Raptor behind , right ? That depends . If they don 't want to give away our location ... That true . Cavil 's baseships could be out there anywhere . Exactly . They 'd know we didn 't make it . They 'd leave somebody . Maybe . - Jump drive 's not responding . - What ? What 's the frak ? - Why not ? - Give me a sec . Poseidon , please protect us from death ... Poseidon , please protect ... A Poseidon medal ? - Hey , we 're a long way from water . - It 's a ship , isn 't it ? I know why the drive is not responding . We jumped over the red line . So now we can 't even jump back to where we started ? Our calculations just got nonlinear ! I knew I didn 't recognize these star patterns . You can recognize star patterns with the naked eye ? They 've never sent us so far . I must have frakked up the coordinates . Or you didn 't . If a high energy charge subatomic particle had hit us , it could have randomly flipped one bit of data in our jump coordinates . It got entered correctly , but corrupted . So , something flips from 1 to 0 sends us to parking end of no place . We don 't know where the fleet is and if we did , we couldn 't go there . { You know what ? } Cavil 's enemy baseships - could be out there anywhere . - Quiet , let me think . Calculations are nonlinear , but they 're not impossible . But we don 't know where we are . There 's still a chance I frakked up ! Don 't you recognize me , Felix ? It makes sense . There 's a star cluster ... It 's me . Pull yourself together , Lieutenant . - They know where the fleet is . - That 's my point , Sir . There was a false alarm . Everyone has jumped back . Over two days , they 're not here . Just give me a Raptor and a pilot . And what would you do with that ? Jump randomly ? There is something in the universe . Something let us find Earth , dead as it is . And I know , I know I can find Felix . - Lieutenant ... - Me and Felix ... There 's been too much loss already . I 'll have to run it by the old man . Thank you , sir . Thank you . Enough food and water for two weeks if we 're not fussy about recycling , so our limiting factor is ... air . 20 hours 's left . Of course , shuttle-dee-doo . On a Raptor with clapped out CO2 scrubbers , frak you very much . Every breath counts now , folks . We 've got to limit exertion , sleep as much as we can . 20 hours . My Gods . After it thinned the air , pulled it into the tanks , we 're at 68 % ship normal load of O2 . 68 ! At that level , you 're talking memory loss , irrational behavior , - depression , dizziness ... - Better dizzy than dead .

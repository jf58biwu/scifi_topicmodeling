Your memory 'sjust playing tricks on you , that 's all . 'She starts to laugh . 'She calls me Rhys the Rant ' and then she kissed me , right there in the queue . ' And I thought then , jack , I thought , ' I 'm going to marry this bloody mad woman , ' even if it kills me . ' BEEPING Worked out what that thing is yet ? No joy yet . But you should have a look at the detail , Tosh . It 's gorgeous . 0h , let me get that . Have you managed to open it yet ? Er , no , sorry . I 'm not doing very well , am I ? It 's gonna be a long night . Yes , which is why I brought . .. .. some sandwiches ! One for you ... And one for me . Smoked salmon , that is your favourite , isn 't it ? How d 'you know that ?

No . How did you get here ? I came with you , jack , remember ? Yeah , ofcourse . Are you OK ? jack , what did you see ? My past . - If what you say is true ... - It is . We love each other . But how could I forget that ? Nothing in . I WAS going to take you out for a meal . Didn 't want the weekend to finish , I suppose . jack , please . Talk to me . What about the past ? Is it your childhood ? I 've always been here for you , jack . From the very beginning . I 'm the one you can confide in , remember ? It was meant to be buried . I buried the memory over 150 years ago . Why now ? Well , maybe it 's time . Maybe up until now , your subconscious was protecting you . But you can 't block out the past forever . I can 't afford to remember . - jack , talk to me , please . - Why ? I can help . Trust me . I 'm not sure I should do this . just tell me what you see . I can help you . That 's why I 'm here . Where are you , jack ? Boeshane Peninsula . My home in the 51st century . We lived under the threat of invasion . They came without warning . We thought they 'd pass over us , like they always did . But they didn 't . - Not that day . - Who ? The most horrible creatures you could possibly imagine . Their howls travelled before them . Run ! Take Gray . Keep him safe ! - Take Gray . - Gray ? My little brother . No , no , Dad . Come with us . No , I 've got to go get your mother . Run ! One minute , I was holding his hand . I don 't know when he let go . Gray ? Gray ? Gray ! Gray , where are you ? Gray ! One minute , his hand was in mine , I don 't know when he let go . I don 't thinkl noticed , I thought he was there , just behind me . Gray ! I retraced my steps , hoping that I 'd see him again . Did you find him ? Gray ! I ran all the way home . Where are you ? Gray ! jack , what did you find ? Dad ? No ! Can someone help ? Please ! I searched for Gray for years . I never found the body . It wasn 't your fault . I let go of his hand ! It was the worst day of my life . It 's the last thing I want to remember . So , according to the molecular breakdown , this potentially alien complex artefact is , in fact , made out of wood . Well , perhaps it fell in the crate by mistake . Picked up meson energy from the other stuff . Yeah , right ! 0h , yes , sorry , it 's a stupid idea . I thinkjack brought it in . No , I 'm sure Adam found it on an excavation a few months back . I 'll have a look in the diary . I like to log the interesting stuff . You write about artefacts in your diary ? Among other things . So , we are done for the night . I guess . Everything all right ? Yeah , just , Adam hasn 't rung yet . Sure he will . I know I would , if it was our anniversary . I wouldn 't disappear . Infact , I would ... cherish you . Ah , Owen ! Yeah , no , no , really , really , Iwould . Infact , I wouldn 't let you out of my sight , Tosh ... .. because I love you . What ? Yeah , there we are . I 've said it . I love you . Yes , I always have , actually , ever since we started working together , and in fact , I actually ache for you . When you 're in the room , I want to reach out and touch you and ... - Owen ! - No , no , no , I can 't keep this secret any more ! My mum said to me , ' Seize the day ' , and so I am seizing it , and I 've got so much love to give you , Tosh , and you won 't know that unless I tell you . So here I am , telling you that I love you . You know I know there 's Adam , OK , but you know , I think ... In fact , I know that we would be amazing together , erm . .. if you would only just give it a chance . Oh , God . Say something . That is completely inappropriate . - Pardon ? - What are you thinking of ? - I 'm sorry , Ijust wanted you to know . - How dare you ! I 'm with Adam . And even if I wasn 't . .. you 're not my type . Never will be . Maybe I should be on my own tonight . No way . What if you forget who you are ? I know who I am . It 's not just you who 's lost something . MOBILE PHONE RINGS But you remember . All you know about me . You 're my girl , my best friend . Suddenly , all that 's gone . A stormer of a night ! What about her , mate ? Where 's he going now ? He just walked off ! He knows I 'm waiting . 0h , fine . I 'll help myself , then ! Here you are . Keep the change . Buy some spot cream ! I 'm not coming here again . It 's overpriced . There 's a Â £ 1.50 charge on the cash machine . It 's a bloody disgrace . GWEN LAUGHS Honestly . Kids these days . Don 't know the meaning of hard work . - What ? - Rhys the Rant ! Always when you 're in a queue , or driving , or when you 're on the phone to one of those automated phone thingies . .. Hey , it 's OK . It 's OK . SHE CRIES Come on , sweetheart . What 's wrong ? My diary.- - You 're not in it . Everyone else is . Why would I leave you out when you 've been here so long ? Like I 'm remembering a man who doesn 't exist . What are you ? Cross me , and I will fill you full of fake memorie until your head is on fire , because that 's howl exist . Gwen . What did you do to her ? Memory is a very delicate thing . Feeding myself in wiped other memories out . It 's a side-effect of what I have to do in order to survive . jack has to know . Remember this . I know you didn 't mean to kill her . You just couldn 't stop yourself . Remember this . I didn 't do that . 0h , yes , you did , and she wasn 't the first . Please don 't hurt me ! 'Good old Ianto , loyal Ianto . 'Roaming the streets at night for bait . ' My ... diary ! All human record is a lie . You twist it into what you want to believe . But we know the rot in your heart . You crave flesh . No . Please . Remember it . Remember it . Remember it ! Remember it ! Remember it ! I helped you dump the bodies . It 's me you call . You know , I forgot what a rush it is , feeding in the bad stuff . Franklin ? Franklin , wake up . Please ! Mom ? Where 's Gray ? Where 's Gray ? Where is he , son ? Where is he ? We were running so fast . One moment , his hand was in mine ... No , not my little boy ! Not my little boy ! Why now ? Why now ? Anything ? It 's still a bit of a blur , but I 'm getting there . That 's all we 've got , really . Memories . That 's what brought us to here . To this point . We found it before , we 'll find it again . You know , I , um , I always worried that you 'd . .. .. that you 'd just settled for me , you know . Cos if you met me now , Gwen , with all that goes on in your life , could be that you wouldn 't look twice at me . Don 't say that . - Do you remember that ? - No . It felt like the first time . But it was nice . I like that . I know . Remind me some more . What 's wrong ? How far would you go for me ? I need to know . Would you die for me ? Yes . Jack ; Ianto . What 's wrong ? You 'll have to put me in the vaults . Lock me up . I killed three girls . Strangled them . Stop kidding around ! I 'm serious . I murdered them , in cold blood . I took their bodies , and ... You have to lock me away ... .. before I turn on you . None of you are safe . Hey , hey , come here , come here . What 's happened to you ? I 'm a monster . Best lie detector on the planet . If something 's untrue , the light turns red . Go . MY " ` .. hands on her throat . And it felt so good . Squeezing the life out of her . It reads as truth . I don 't believe it . OK , tell me about the second girl . She tried to get away ... .. but I was too quick . Pleading . .. And I ... I didn 't care . Something in me wants to kill . No . This is not you . Something 's changed you . You 're not a murderer . I 'm certain of it . 'All human record is a lie . 'You crave flesh . 'Remember this . ' A year ago today ... you remembered . ' Do you remember that ? 'Who the hell is this ? ' 'just cos that 's what I said to you on your first day , remember . ' JACK REWINDS ' Remember ? Remember ? ' Well , I came with you , jack , remember . Remember , remember . I can help you - that 's why I 'm here . 'Remember this . ' Come here , come here , just look , look . 'Remember it . ' IANT0 SCREAMS ' Remember it , remember it , remember it . 'Remember it . ' Where 's Adam 's blood sample ? Everything 's in order here . When was it last updated ? Um ... 2lâ € ? hours ago . Owen ... About last night , um , it was selfish of me . Owen , I think the world of you . .. I know . I 'm really sorry . I don 't want to jeopardise our friendship . The most important thing is that you 're happy . Thank you . Tosh ... You are ... you are happy with Adam , aren 't you ? Completely . OK . Hey , how are you today ? Um , things are coming back slowly . Rhys thought I shouldn 't come into work but ... Hey , we 'll look after you . You just have to give yourself time . COITIC 0 | â € ™ I , g | â € ? Up THEY CHAT AND GIGGLE Hey Ianto , come here . You all right , mate ? Listen , I could murder a coffee . Talk to me , Adam . If that 's even your name . - What ? - What are you doing , jack ? He 's not who you think he is . He 's been feeding himself into our memories , by touch . Is this some kind of sickjoke ? He didn 't exist until two days ago . Can somebody tell me what 's going on , please ? jack , we 've known him for years . - He is part ofthe team . - No . He just made you think that . Come on , jack . Ah , you don 't get to me like that . jack , you know me . You recruited me three years ago . When I think of my team I see you there . But I don 't feel anything for you . No pride , no warmth ... You , the one who I can confide in , the one who unburied the dead . jack , maybe you 've forgotten him . Like I did with Rhys ? I should have spotted it then . That wasn 't stress . That was him . By making us think we know him , he disturbs our real memories . I have no idea what you 're talking about . I 'm taking him to the vaults . - jack , this is ridiculous . - No ! No ! - Tosh , that 's not gonna help . - It 's fine . I 'm just going to lock him up . Let him go . I 'm not going to harm him . Why should I believe you ? Tosh , Tosh , we can talk about this . Drop the gun , jack . Get off me ! This is what y0u 've done to us . Move . ADAM ! Don 't kill me . I had to become part of your memories in order to survive . I didn 't mean any harm . - You 've changed us . - For the better ! You didn 't remember who you were . I helped you . Look at Owen , all his cynicism gone . He 's a different man now . Selfless , happier . And Toshiko , too - she 's never been this confident . How did you come here ? Why us ? All of you have such unique memories , specially you , jack . All those extraordinary memories you hold - some hidden , some absent . Your singular mind . That 's what drew me here . Good job . It 's what we do best ... wipe out aliens . You can 't shoot me . You made me live . And you always remember what you killed ... don 't you , jack ? Our memories define us . Adam changed those memories ... changed who we are . Now I have to help you all go back , find a memory that defines you . Rediscover who you are . If I 'm wrong , he 'll still be here when we 've done this . Let me take you back to before we all met ... Feel around for anything that makes you what you are ... .. the hidden and the forgotten . Tell me where you are . 'The college canteen ... 'Rhys is sitting opposite me , telling stupid jokes . ' RHYS : ' Where do you find a tortoise with no legs ? Where you left it . ' 'It 's my birthday . I 'm ten . 'Mum spends the whole day screaming , ' I love you because you 're my son ' 'but that doesn 't mean I have to like you . ' ' 'Maths club , ' something so reliable about maths ... 'always the right answer . ' 'Meeting Lisa , ' falling in love , ' never felt so alive . ' 'I turn 16 . She packs my bags . ' That is the nicest thing y0u 've done for me in years , Mother . 'Kissing him in the supermarket . ' The look on his face . 'My first flat . ' I don 't have a flat-warming . 'There 's no-one I want to invite . ' 'Losing Lisa . ' Like the world had ended . 'The way he looks at me sometimes . 'As if he 's scared of what he feels for me , ' I love him . But not in the way I love you . Take this . 'Knowing there has to be more to life than this . ' 'Knowing I 'm special , ' waiting for someone to see it . I saw it . You save one life , 100 lives but it 's never enough . Who 'll save me ? I will . 'Coming here gave me meaning again . You . You each have a short-tern amnesia pill . It 'll make you forget Adam . We have to wipe out the last 48 hours from our memories , go back to who we were . I 'm going to lose so much . None of it was real . He loved me ... and I loved him . It 's no different from real memory . He forced it on you . You have to let it go . Goodbye , Adam . just me left . jack , I know what it 's like not to exist . Please don 't send me back there . I have to . What are you going to do ? This will wipe out the past two days . Well , you 'll still keep the bad memories . Because they were always yours . But what about the good times , jack ? What about the last good memory of you and your dad ? - It 's lost . - I can help you find it . I can take you back there . Before I die . Why would you do that ? I was in the void for so long , the colours of this world almost blinded me , jack . It was so beautiful after the darkness and the stench of fear . You gave me that . Let me do this for you . Come on . You want this . It 's early evening ... just me and Dad . Oh , no , you don 't ! JACK GIGGLES You 're out ! You know , one day you won 't want to play with your old dad any more . Never . Are you there ? Yeah . Me , Dad and ... - Dad ! Mom said I could play too . .. - Gray . Hey , Gray ! - All right , son . One more . - OK . Whoa , I 'll get it . JACK LAUGHS I 'm running for the ball ! Some other boy is there . I don 't know who . - Can I play ? - Who are you ? - My name 's Adam . - Let me play . Before it gets dark . There 's lots of room . Hey , what are you doing ? Are you all right ? Ijust want to play . He can play . No ! He doesn 't belong here . I don 't want him playing with us . I 'm Adam . Don 't touch my dad . Hey , easy ! Are you all right , Adam ? Yes , he just doesn 't want to share . Right , well , if you 're going to behave that way , we 're going home . - What ? ! - Come on , Gray . No , we don 't leave yet . We play some more , it gets dark , we light a fire ... Mum joins us . Come on , son . I 'll race you . Race you ! Dad ! You did this . You spoilt it . I made it happen . Dad ! Dad , I love you . Dad , wait ... Dad ! I want the real memory back . Then let me live . That box you found contains my last good memory of you , your dad and Gray . You see , I 'm a part of it now and I 'll always live as long as you remember it . That 's why you took me back . Wasn 't it lovely ? Playing in the sand , no-one knowing what was ahead ... your dad laughing . Gray , safe and happy . I don 't want to die ! You take that pill and you will lose everything I 've given you . Wipe me out now and you will lose all your memories of your father . He will cease to have existed for you . Goodbye , Adam . Dad ! Gray ! Come back ! It wasn 't like this ! Dad ! Gray ! jack , how have we lost two days ? What d 'you mean ? The last 48 hours . None of us can remember a thing . The system 's blank , the CCIâ € ™ V 's been wiped . What 's been going on ? What 've we been doing ? I don 't know . Great ! That 's two days of my life that I 'll never get back ! Looks like Toshiko got herself a secret admirer , though . 0h , yeah ? To Tosh , love and apologies , Owen . They 're from you ! In your dreams , Tosh . I think someone 's winding you up , darling ... No , I don 't do flowers ... .. and I definitely don 't do apologies . Did you call ? Found your diary . Yep , been looking for that . And for the record ... measuring tapes never lie . Yep ? Who 's Adam ? Don 't know . Torchwood Season02 Episode05 Adam

For Christ 's sake ! Where did they go ? Where did who go ? - The door knocked . - No , it didn 't . There was someone trying to get in , I heard them . Tom , nobody knocked . Three words . Ho-li-day . I 'll be with you shortly . There 's sombody on the door if you want anything . I warned you about the coffee , didn 't I ? Remember you said " rich " on the day you took my family . On the day you took my children and put my husband in a box . Remember you said " rich " . I apologise for the coffee . Hello ? - Quite a handful , isn 't she ? - Who 's speaking ? And attractive , too , I 'm sure you 've noticed . But then , you have quite an eye for the ladies , don 't you , Mr Syme ? Pot , kettle ... Although I 'm not sure I 'd trust you with the wife of a friend . Pot , kettle ... Who is this ? Who 's speaking ? Miranda Callendar , private investigator .

And his principle betrayer , and abducter of his wife . Abducter ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I 've just watched her being driven into your offices .

She says we paid her off for something . - Peter , excuse me ... - What is it ? - May . - Peter . Thanks . - What is it ? - Can we talk outside ? Why ? Mr Syme ...

It just never gets old . What do you say , lover ? Ready to go again ? Please , don 't ! Just let me . Now , now . It 'll be over in a minute . Finishing touches . Look at this ! Please ! What ? She 'll be here any second . Oh , jolly good . Do sit down . Thank you ... Just to remind us why we 're all here . I hope your hand is as strong as you think it is . No , you don 't . Ah , Claire . Mrs Jackman . Mrs Jackman . Miranda Callendar , I think you know , who you employed to follow your husband . She 's been a little unforthcoming on what she found . Do I get a refund ? And this is Min , her assistant . Actually , I 'm a detective too . No , she isn 't . - I 'm on the cusp . - No , you 're not . - It 's a gray area . - Min ! And this is Katherine Reimer , I 'm sure Tom 's mentioned her . I 've heard a lot about you , Mrs Jackman . Well , I 've heard bloody nothing about you , dear . I work for your husband . And you dress like that when you do , or do you wear clothes ? - I wear clothes . - Does he notice ? Half the time . As you can see , everyone here is aware of your husband 's interesting condition . Great . You all knew . Fantastic . No one think it was worth telling me ? I married a werewolf , someone could 've mentioned it . You didn 't marry a werewolf , Mrs Jackman , you married Dr Jekyll . Dr Jekyll ? Dr Henry Jekyll . Died in Edinburgh in 1886 . Dr Jekyll ... and Mr Hyde ? " Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde " was a story . - It wasn 't . - No , it isn 't . Sorry . I just ... Just trying to catch on here , just trying to be clear . I married Dr Jekkyl and Mr Hyde ? Yes , you did . Come on , seriously . I 'm Mrs Jekyll Hyde ? Yes , you are . Isn 't that just typical ? That 's so like a man . There 's always something they 're not telling you . " Sorry hun , should have mentioned , I 'm Dracula . " - This is not a joke . - This is not serious . Henry Jekyll died without issue , he 's the last of the Jekyll line . I 'm sorry ? That means no children . I know what it means ! Tom Jackman can 't be Jekyll 's descendent , because Henry Jekyll had no descendents . That doesn 't make any sense . None , whatsoever . What has Tom told you about his parents ? He was fostered . His mother abandoned him . On a railway platform in Belfast in 1967 . Six months after he was born . I don 't believe that . You don 't think he was abandoned ? I don 't think he was born . Excuse me . But please ... I don 't wanna miss anything . We 're ready then ? As soon as you give the word . Is she there ? How 's she been ? Well , Venice , she 's jetlagged . I should 've contemplated it . OK , off you go , might as well get started . I 'm just gonna say this again . You know that there 's no guarantee . I know . Good luck . OK everyone , it 's a go . We 're gonna have to clear the room . Miss Utterson ? We 're clearing the room now . Of course . Where are you ? I went to the hospital . I don 't know , I feel ... You 've been gone a whole night ! Where have you been ? I don 't know , I woke up on the beach . Claire , it 's weird , I feel ... I feel ... You feel what ? Fantastic ! I feel fantastic ! - What 've you been doing ? - I don 't know , I just ... I feel ... I don 't need my glasses . What ? My glasses , I don 't need them , I don 't even know where they are . I can see perfectly , 20 / 20 vision . It 's like being a kid again , I can see ! Do you have your wallet ? My wallet ? Have you had a bang on the head ? Tom , you 're not making any sense ! How could a bang on the head fix my eyesight ? I don 't know ! Tom , something 's happened to you , something bad , and it hasn 't fixed your eyesight ! Just check your wallet . For God 's sake , I 'm telling you I can see . Tom , where 's the hospital , I 'm coming over . Where 's the hospital ? Shit ! No ! Get in ... - Is everything OK ? - What ? Are you alright in there ? I 'm fine . Jesus ! Who are you ? What are you ? This way . Sorry about the lights . Watch your step . I mean , you gotta think " fixer upper " . There 's a lot of potentiel here , there 's a lot of rooms . Okay . I can read a face , mate . There 's a couple of rentals in Hammersmith . They 'll probably be more up your street . I mean , this place ... I know I shouldn 't say , but quite honestly ... I wouldn 't lock up my worst enemy in this place . i would . Dr Henry Jekyll died in Edinburgh in 1886 . Six months after his death , all of his research notes , plus whatever survived from his various experiments pass on to the ownership of a newly formed company , Klein Utterson . Klein Utterson still survived to this day . And how do you find the Mason employer , Mr Syme ? American . And initially Scottish . That 's a frightening combination . Klein Utterson also took possession of something else . The body of Dr Henry Jekyll . How am I doing ? Fascinating fairy tale . There 's a copy of this fairy tale with my lawyer . I hope that 's enough to secure my safety for the evening . Oh , absolutely . You should definitely hope that . In the seventy years following Jekyll 's death and in total secrecy , there were , I think , sixteen attempts to recreate his experiment . Resulting in sixteen deaths . Then , in 1965 , Winston Churchill died . And in the papers , a few months later , a silly season 's story ... about our old friends Klein Utterson and how they were going to bring good old Winston back . How ? Cloning . A clone ... created from the DNA harvested from his body . A brand new grow-you-own Winston . How 's that going , by the way ? Is he done yet ? You 're going to make a clone of Winston Churchill ? Of course not . Just some bloody idiot mouthing off in a pub . Tried to impress a girl from Hull , according to the records . Unfortunately , her father worked for one of our more estimed tabloids . You weren 't trying to clone Winston Churchill , of course . You were trying to clone Henry Jekyll . After all those years of failing to recreate his experiment , you finally decided to throw in the towel and recreate the man himself . How am I doing now ? It took until 1997 to succesfully clone a sheep . You really imagine that in 1965 , we were able to clone a dead Victorian ? Klein Utterson were successfully cloning farm animals in the 1950s . Although , anyone who tried to speak about it ended up very rich or disappeared . - Which are you hoping for ? - Neither . You think Tom Jackman is a clone ? A genetic experiment ? Grown in a lab ? Yes . I see . Tell Colonel Hart we 'll be needing him . This is over . Why ? Because Tom Jackman is not a clone . You have nothing . You have walked in here with nothing . I 'm sorry . Why are you sorry , Peter ? - So soon ? - We think he 's stabilised . - Vital signs ? - All normal . Tom ? What 've you done to him ? I told you about a cure for his condition over 50 years ago what d 'you think ? You 're gonna cure him . No . We 've already cured him . I think we should take Mrs Jackman down with us . - Why ? - Because she 's entitled . What about them ? They 'll have to stay here . Why ? No , it 's OK , Mrs Jackman , you go ... See your husband . We 'll see you again shortly . Yeah , see you . Bloody shame , actually . You should 've been working for me . You said I had nothing . Nothing at all , really . But you were so close . But if ... If Henry Jekyll had no descendents , is Tom Jackman is not a clone , then where did he come from ? I was hoping you were gonna tell us , because ... We don 't have the faintest idea . Daddy ? Is that you , Daddy ? Are you my daddy ? Did you wanna know what I look like , Daddy ? You did , didn 't you ? What do you think , are you proud ? What do you look like , Daddy ? Are you old ? Are you really really old ? You feel old . I can feel you in here . Feel your thoughts . Old dusty thoughts . Old and scared . You 're so scared ! Why are you so scared , Daddy ? You scared of me ? Are you married ? Do I have a mummy ? Or are you alone ? You feel alone . You think alone . I can feel what you think . Think of a number . No , do it , Daddy ! Think of a number ! A big silly number , go on , it 's a game ! Say it out loud , a big fat number , any big fat number . One hundred and three . Oh , God ! I was right , wasn 't I ? Bet I was . I 'm in your head ! I know what you think , I am what you think ! Scared now , aren 't you Daddy ? Scaredy-scaredy Daddy ! I 'm not scared of you ! Yes , you are . Coming to get you , Daddy . Coming to eat you , Daddy . You 've got a vivid imagination , Daddy ! I 've been there . Shut up . Shut up ! Shut up ! Just a moment . Who is it ? Delivery , sir . I didn 't order anything . 6 , Statler Street ? Dr Jackman ? You phoned yesterday , you said it was an emergency . New television set . D 'you want some help opening the box ? Why is he in that box ? It 's the only way to keep him stable . He 'll be ready for us in a moment . D 'you want some coffee ? Can somebody get one ? Why now ? You 've had a cure for over 50 years , you said . Because your husband ... Claire ... Tom 's dying . Every change is shredding his DNA . He won 't see fourty-five . He may not even see the end of the month . We couldn 't wait any longer , we wanted to . Why ? About a minute and he 's all yours . Thank you . Why did you want to wait , Peter ? We know how to stabilise him , and how to stop the changes , but we didn 't know in which form he 'd stabilise . - It 's Hyde we want . - I don 't want Hyde . I know . Watch it , it 's hot . - Go away . - It 's alright . Who 's he now ? How do you know which one he 's stabilised as ? We open the box . And then what ? Either you take Dr Jackman home , or ... Mr Hyde stays here . They 're both my husband . No , Hyde is ours . I see . Well , then ... I 'll have that coffee , thanks . I 'd wish you luck , but you wouldn 't believe me . It 's not an even chance , is it ? You wouldn 't be doing this if it was . You think it 's Hyde in there . They do . You don 't ? At every stage of this , Tom 's been stronger than expected . - I 'd never bet against him . - You sound like you 're proud of him . He 's my friend . Yes . He 's your friend . - How hot ? - Ver hot . Thanks . - Ice ! - I apologise for the coffee . Come on then , what are you waiting for ? Get my husband out of that bloody box .

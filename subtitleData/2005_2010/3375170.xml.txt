During the blackout , The A.I. reseerve generator powered for itself In doing so shut down the Building 's other systems . This ai , gas control over The building ? You make it sound like a Monster movie . The facility and ai are Interconnected to the extent That it needs the facility 's Resources to help it grow . Does growing involve Allowing to agonizing death of an otherwise healthy man ? I don 't know what his Intentions were . Intentions . Now that does osound like a Monster movie . Which is why we need to Find out . Thank you , colonel . Good to see you . Sarah Gail , Alex , Welcome to Dakara Have to bear with us , we Had a break-in last night .

Chip . It 's a super computer . Small enough to fit on the end Of your finger . They want to license it to us . We quietly put it through its Paces , and they get a real World test , and if it works , We are all geniuses . Very rich geniuses . What do you need for this Chip ? A deposit . Japanese friends are very risk Averse . They want half a million to Demonstrate seriousness . You think it works . This chip ? It 's the future . I have been in warmer morgues . Got to keep the temperature not to go frozen Towers would fry . Computer is like everything Else . Power it generates heat , Requires cooling , needs more Power . You know Babylon is a kind of a pig . Babylon . You know the story £ ¿ I minored in beer bang Engineering . I didn 't read a lot of Stories . It was a marvel . God destroyed it . God have gave it a shot yesterday . The blackout should have shut it down completely . Should it Babylon routed every watt From the generates to keep Itself running . It broke the rules . It invented new ones . Mr Waiver said dr. sherman Worked on the ... Yeah . Touchy feely , BS , if you Ask me . How did it feel about him ? Sorry ? Babylon . How did it feel about Dr. sherman ? I know how that sounds . It 's a computer . I mean , how does a coffee Maker feel about coffee ? You heard me . You are asking if I knew It was killing sherman when it threw the switch ? Impossible . Help . It 's not enough . What would be enough ? Everything . Everything then . You are certain ? Certain as - - is a luxury . The rules do not apply . I guess it 's enough . Are you okay ? I 'm still patient Big prolong . You have to use the full range Of tools on a guy like him Before you can close . You are lucky you and your Tech pair aren 't as tight . You are kidding ? A little bit . Are you sure you want to do This in cash ? I don 't like banks . Return the toast , proper Etiquette . Used to think that it was Impossible . Circuits are so tiny you are All but in the quantum realm . It 's the most sophisticated Process on earth . If you could take your Memories , your consciousness , Everything that makes you a Person , turn it into pure data And download it on to a Machine . That you could run it . Are you going to eat that ? America . I love it here . No pressure . No expectations . Good sucker So how long do you estimate Before we stop screwing around Here and you hand over the Chip ? Pleasure to do business With you . Don 't worry . Didn 't know you spoke Japanese . I was into stix before Duran , duran . My turn . No , it 's not , it 's my turn . Whatever . It 's my turn . Hand me the remote . You missed dinner again . Leftovers are in the Fridge . All right . Give it back . The remote . You took it , and I know you Did . Riley saw . I did not , you lier .

He was in the lab when the Power went out . Biometrics showed normal . Generators came on line . Power went to the server Farms . Dr. sherman tried to leave but The electronic door failed . His pulse increased . There was only enough power to run and cool the servers . Security and biometric Monitoring went off line . John henry , show me Security video and biometrics For the lab at the time External power returned . His heart had stopped . His body temperature had risen To the room to almost double Standard temperatures . Well above human Survivorability levels . He was dead . But john henry says medical attention require it .

John henry , What image do you associate With that information ? Has no feeling for what it Did . Has no opinion . That 's what I was telling you . Sure , you taught it Procedures . You taught it rules . But it has got no ethics , no Morales . Whether it had any feeling About dr. sherman shouldn 't Matter . If you had taught it to value Sherman 's life . Someone killed a man .

 You shouldn 't nest in the chimney . You 're migratory. you need to find a mate . That 's a window , bird . What am I going to do with you ? A bird in a chimney is a fire hazard . I 'm not supposed to kill you , but you can 't stay here . Go . I was wondering when we 'd see you again . They make you rest a couple days . Does it help ? Not really . Is there any more somewhere ? Yeah. downstairs under the sink . I just needed a minute alone . Sorry . She say something ? She asked about it . To be nice , I think . Well , it 's nobody 's business . Well , it shouldn 't have happened here . Or not at all . It 's in the past . People don 't forget about the past . I 'm not saying " forget it . " I 'm saying it 's in the past . Sight 's off . Give me . It 's nice being able to waste bullets on apples . Yeah. it 's nice being able to waste apples . April 21st , 2011 . I never asked you for judgment day . Your judgment day . You 're right about the sight . April 21st , 2011. that 's mine . What 's yours ? Whatever mine is . It might not be anymore . So don 't be afraid about love or not when it happens . I want you to help me with something . Didn 't I just help with something this morning in the shower ? There 's a guy. he 's got some information I need . So ask him . Not that kind of guy. not that kind of information . Skynet ? I 'm not here to stop the war , sweetie . I 'm here to win it . - John connor . - John connor . You keep saying that . But I don 't know what it means . I 'm the one living with him . How 's that working out for you ? Is the metal alive and well ? Sarah running you around ? I 'm here . I 'm asking you . Either help me with my plan or show me some progress on yours . Okay. what do you need ? There was a stack of research here on that lawyer . The one who set up the drone shell company . Derek took it . - When ? - while you were gone . So he 's chasing it down ? - I don 't know . - he should keep me in the loop . It 's my loop . You 've been distracted . I was kidnapped . Which is distracting . Talk to me about riley . What happened the day she tried to kill herself ? She was very upset. john could tell . She had a bruise on her face . Who gave her the bruise ? John thought it was her foster dad . - She said it was a door . - liar. then what ? Riley cut her wrists like this . She almost bled to death . Do you think it was her foster dad ? It 's hard to say . We don 't know much about riley . We should know more . I know where she lives . I 'll go talk to her foster parents . I 'll go. my loop . I killed a bird . Not the one in the chimney . I thought you should know . A bird did that ? No . I did that. look . The bird experienced an involuntary moment of my fingers . It was fragile . Wiggle your fingers . Yeah , there 's damage , but it 's buried pretty deep in there . I don 't know how it happened . It was probably during a fight . You 're not designed to fight other machines . All right , look , maybe I could swap this out . But it 's not like we just have spare parts lying around . You 're supposed to burn the endos . Not all of them . Says who ? You . What , future me ? Future you . Yeah , why doesn 't that surprise me ? I have damage to my hand and now you 're able to fix it . Future john has better information than you do . - Jesse , she 's gonna kill me . - What ? Who ? - Her . Cameron . - What happened ? What did it do ? I saw something . The metal . - The metal . - She cut her wrists . Why did it cut itself ? I don 't know. but I saw the metal . And she knows that I saw it . Sweetie , if she knew you saw , you 'd be dead . I can 't go back there . I wonder what 's wrong with it . - Has it been acting strange ? - strange ? Everything she does is strange . Did you not hear me ? - I can 't go back there . - Of course you can , dear . You put one foot in front of the other . Master your fear . Remember the mission . There 's gotta be another way . Trust me . There is only one way . I won 't let cameron hurt you . I won 't let anyone hurt you . Here 's one from my private stash . Kay doesn 't buy the kind with sugar or caffeine but What 's the point ? I hear you . Must 've been a shock , what happened to riley . What 's john say ? Getting anything out of that boy is like pulling teeth . But he did say that she seemed upset that day and , uh , She had a bruise on her face . Bruise ? I 'm a patient person , but I swear , there have been times ... Kids. they know how to push your buttons . Just saying if someone was to lose their temper ... Get physical ... If by someone , you mean me ... These things do happen . These things do happen . But not the way you 're thinking . Not--not by a long shot . That girl assaulted my wife . Went absolutely nuts . Started yelling about the world burning Up and bleached skulls or some such nonsense . She said that ? I wanted to report it . Kay wouldn 't let me . But now I wish I had with you coming around here accusing us . I 'm not accusing anybody . First your kid drops out of school , then so does she . Next thing you know , we got a guidance counselor at our door . Even she thinks john 's a bad influence . A guidance counselor . She had a lot to say about you and your family . I was willing to dismiss it as gossip ... Until I met you . Do you have her name ? Keep john away from riley . She 's been through enough . Okay , clench your fist . And , okay , now , fingers straight . Okay . You feel any different ? Yes . Are you all fixed ? I don 't know . Well , just try not to kill any more birds . You 're ahead of schedule . With what ? What you need to learn . I know it 's just recon , derek , But I can 't have you running off like that . I gotta go . Miss wilson , thanks for coming . Ms. baum . So your family 's moved around a lot , I take it . Unfortunately , my job requires it . It 's been difficult on john . hard for him to make friends . I can imagine . That 's why I was so happy when riley first came home with him . I didn 't realize she was so troubled . Foster kids like these , it 's hard to tell . A lot of them come from broken homes , abuse . Where does she come from ? An orphan out of Riverside . Her parents died in a fire in a meth lab . It 's tragic . I met her foster dad . He said you talked to him about us . I was curious about why it happened in your home . In your bathroom . I have no idea . My main concern is that the girl get help . Of course . I 've only known her a short while , but I 've grown fond of her . It 's funny , she thinks you don 't like her . It 's not the case . So you 're the one who took her to the hospital afterwards ? No . I was out of town . So there was no adult supervision in the household at the time . John 's uncle stays with us sometimes . Yeah , riley 's mentioned the uncle . Uncle derek . John 's uncle on his father 's side . We 're not involved if that 's what you 're getting at . Not getting at anything. just trying to paint a picture . Do you think it 's wise to have an unattached , Adult male hanging around a pretty , Teenage girl who 's obviously so desperate for attention ? What , did she say something about him ? She might have. if she did , it 's confidential . Miss wilson , look , John 's a good kid . Whatever 's going on with this girl , he 's trying to be her friend . He 's trying to help her . Like by taking her to mexico ? Mexico ? Riley said she and john took a trip to mexico . Now , I don 't have to tell you that transporting a minor across The border without her parents permission is a federal offense . I didn 't know . Obviously , I will talk to my son . Miss baum , I 'm not out to get anyone here . My sense is that you 're a decent person , a hardworking mom . I 'i'm a big believer in keeping your own house in order . So why don 't I let you handle this your way ... For now . I 'd appreciate that . Consider it done . Keep taking the antibiotics . - That 's it ? - Why ? Is there something else you need , sweetie ? - No . - ' Cause we really could use the room . What are you doing ? I 'm looking up a restaurant address . Are you hungry ? Yeah. but , uh , this is actually for derek . That kaliba lawyer he 's been tracking , The guy 's got a booth reserved there . Not an ideal location for derek to acquire his target . It 's underground , and according to this , crowded with friendly people . Hard to dispose of the body . I don 't think that 's gonna be necessary . Derek 's just gonna follow him and grab him and press him about kaliba . To see if it 's connected to skynet ? Exactly. it 's going to be necessary . I 'll make you a sandwich . Wait. why ? You 're hungry . Why don 't we let hungry be my problem ? Sometimes it 's nice to have help . How 's the hand ? Not a problem . Aren 't you supposed to be really good at self-repair ? Yes . But sometimes it 's nice to have help . Yes . Well , I 'll make my own sandwich . This one taken ? No . You buying ? Nope . I could , uh , introduce you to davy . I 'm here for business , not pleasure , thanks . My mistake . That one , huh ? What 's he do anyway ? Lawyer . He ever buy you a drink ? Once or twice . How 'd the muscle feel about that ? They very much enjoy the show . It 's nice having an audience . It 's you coming over later , right ? Yeah , we 'll just- - just watch a movie or something . OK , i 'll see you soon It 's suddenly a interesting conversation with a guidance counselor from your old school . Oh , i-i , uh , I forgot to send in the quarterly home schooling thing . Actually , that didn 't come up . The main topic of conversation was riley . What about her ? She has a lot to say about you and me and derek and ... Mexico . School counselor told you this ? All those things . From a stranger 's lips to my own ears , john . No , that doesn 't make any sense . And I talked to her foster dad . I would 've talked to him longer , but he asked me to leave . He thinks we 're the reason she tried to kill herself . Because of mexico ? Because riley had a violent breakdown About bleached skulls and the end of the world . I haven 't told her anything . I don 't believe you . Well , I swear to god I 've said nothing . I 'll talk to her . Might be too late for that . Well , what do you want me to do ? I want you to prepare yourself for what 's gonna happen when cameron finds out . Cameron , do you think it 's possible for me to Know something future john doesn 't know ? That 's hard to know . Seems unlikely . Do you think it 's possible for me to know something you don 't know ? Are you asking me if future john kept secrets from me ? I 'm sure he did . Is john here ? Yeah . You owe him an explanation for all the things you said . What I 've said ? To your foster dad. to your guidance counselor . Guidance counselor ? You 're a terrible liar. you don 't owe me . It 's him who put his trust in you . People know things , riley. true things . They know about Mexico . John Why would I spill my guts to my foster dad or to a guidance counselor ? I 've never said anything to anyone , I swear . What would I even say ? Can we go somewhere more private , please ? You expecting someone else ? No . Someone with a clipboard . May I help you ? Hi , there . I 'm molly malloy . I 'm with the department of child and family services . How can I help you ? Well , I was hoping that I could speak with you about Riley Dawson . She 's not here , is she ? No , she 's not . Are you john ? yes . What 's this regarding ? Would it be easier if I came in for a quick chat ? Thank you . This is your fault . What 's my fault ? You 're the reason that person is here . You 're john 's sister . You can 't keep me here . They don 't always like the way I do things . I 've heard you keep guns in the home , which , of course , Is every american 's right . For security . We were robbed . Have you ever carried a weapon outside of the house ? Can I ask again what this is about ? I 'm just clearing up a few details about what kind of Environment you 've got for kids like riley or even john here . I did a little search and couldn 't find A concealed weapons permit in your name . Check the state of new mexico . Hmm. well , out of state permits aren 't valid in California . True , but we have 60 days to file an ownership report with the d.o.j. Sharp kid . I 'll be on the lookout for that . What am I going to do with you ? I don 't understand . I don 't know what you mean . Children and family services respond to complaints . Are you a complainer ? No. no . I never told them anything . What would I even tell them ? You don 't belong here . John isn 't right for you and you 're not right for him . He can 't see that . Stop. please. you 're freaking me out . You 're unreliable . I don 't know what you do . I 'm just john 's girlfriend. that 's it . You can 't be john 's girlfriend . You 're a threat . You can 't stay here anymore . But I can 't let you leave . You 're John 's sister . What am I going to do with you ? Nothing . You can 't do anything to me 'Cause you 're John 's sister . Get it through your head . You 're just his sister . Riley , come with me . All right . You wanna wait outside for me ? Were you gonna kill her ? I don 't know what I was going to do . What do you mean you didn 't know what you were gonna do ? Since when do you not know what you 're gonna do ? I don 't know . I should 've killed her . she 's a threat to you . That is not your decision to make . It 's usually not a decision . Well , obviously it is this time . And it 's not yours . What 's happening with you ? I don 't know . I didn 't make that call . I know that . I believe you. really . Riley , is there anything you want to tell me ? About what ? About anything . Is there anything you want to tell me ? - John ... - Because today is the day . Today is the day where you tell me Whatever it is that you might want to tell me . Today . No . Is there anything that you want to tell me , john ? 'Cause you 're right . I think today is the day . No . You 're late . Where have you been ? I was hungry and I hate room service . What 's all this ? Recon on our guy . He 's got security 24 / 7 . Two 12 hour shifts . Four guys total. armed . The place he 's staying at is up in the hills . High walls. lots of cameras. guys with guns . We should take this slow . No. no slow . He 's chartered a flight out of the country . We 'll grab him on the way to the airport . It 's a moving target with a precise window . But , you see , the roads up there are narrow and isolated . I 'm not sure I can do this .

That 's absurd . No , it 's not . You knew that was the only thing that would turn John against her . She 's supposed to kill me . You called the dcfs . You called my foster parents . You called my school . How could you do that to me ? I trusted you . I loved you ! I rescued you from hell and I took you to paradise ! I gave you a purpose . A chance to be a hero . You know how few people get a chance for their lives to mean something ? For their deaths to mean something ? I made you matter . Stop ! Stop ! You could 've been beautiful .

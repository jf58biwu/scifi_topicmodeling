 Take that ! Hank , are you even close to finished ? Dad ! Dean , you smell like a whore . What 's that ? Not again ! - Brock ! - What ? - You said to put on your best outfit . - Outfit , Hank . - Not costume . - What the f ... ? I guess you can 't come . - Right ? Hank can 't come ? - Nice try , Dean . I 'm giving you three minutes to get changed ... or you walk and I let Dean drive the Charger . - What did you do , shave with a hatchet ? - I used the razor with the pink handle . That 's my daisy ! I use that one for my head . - I thought God shaved your head . - He does ! But he leaves the sides , Mr. Wisenheimer . I have been attempting to stave off this awkward , yet necessary conversation . - Please , dad . - This is my duty ! What is funny about my duty ? You know I take my duty quite seriously . You said ... - Never mind . - I share your nervousness . But there are certain facts that a father must impart to his daughter ... on occasions such as this ... Yes , " doody " . Clever . - Dad ... - Hear me out ! When young women reach oestrus ... the lingam craves ... the stamen-like skills of the yoni . - This is quite natural . - Dad , come on . I 'm doing you a favor . Yes , Mr. Venture has been kind enough to give me some leeway with the rent ... if I get the boys , as he says , " out of his hair " for the evening . But as you know , tonight I teach conjuring at the new school . It 's not a problem . Kim and I could use a free dinner . It 's just that boys at their age have unchecked desires coursing ... nay , raging , as a tempest would , through their tingling nethers ! Come on , dad ! I 'm going on a date with ... the Venture Brothers ! Rembrandt van Rijn . 150 years ago , Delacroix said of Rembrandt ... that his works would be held higher than those of Raphael . His blasphemous prophecy came true within 50 years . And this one could be yours for the pittance of 10 million . American . - No , I want the Mona Lisa . - Look . The Mona Lisa 's not a better painting , merely more famous . And it was made more famous because it was stolen . - And this was stolen , so ... - What about her famous smile ? Whatever . She looks like a horse ! It 's tiny , you know , the thing is like , this big . - Really ? - Yes , really . So this is cheaper . By the ... By the foot . My queen has arrived . And bearing wine shandies . My own variation on tinto de verano . Just a little what-not I picked up in Costa de la Lu ... - What is this crap ? - It 's a Rembrandt , how dare you ? I know it 's a Rembrandt . This is arch-villainy to you ! It 's a stolen Rembrandt . That 's nefarious . That 's ... That 's kind of evil . No ? When I met you , you wouldn 't even bother with guys like that . Not everybody has a trust fund like your insect ex-boyfriend . If you think I 'll go back to a diet of Rammen Noodles and Spaghetti-Os ... driving around in a Honda Accord with a ghost on the hood , sorry . I have plans . - What are you doing ? - I 'm wringing my hands ... menacingly . Well , nobody can see that ! You 're a bookkeeper . Nothing more than an accountant in spandex , and you don 't even know it ! You want evil ! You want the old stuff ? Fine ! Happy ? - F ... great , I think I killed him . - No , I 'm not happy . - All of this is ludicrous ! - Great ! He 's bleeding from his wounds . - Way to over-react ! - I 'll need some seltzer . - What are you thinking ? - This carpet is Persian ! Irreplaceable ! What with there not being a Persia anymore . Forget it ! I 'm gonna go change . We 've those stupid dinner plans with The Monarch at eight . That seltzer isn 't going to get itself ! 24 ! Ready The Monarch Mobile ! Your leader has a date . We kind of don 't have a Monarch Mobile anymore . - Why not ? - We ditched it ! The heat was on us , after that Venture brother thing , so we thought ... - All right , fine . What are our options ? - We can take my Nissan Stanza . - Shotgun call , totally ! - What color is it ? Is it diabolical ? Or at least butterfly colored ? - It 's powder blue . Mostly . - Great . - 21 , what do you drive ? - His powder blue Stanza . I 'm finished with work for today . No , I wanted the boys away because I made a discovery of the ... Bond scientific kind . - What did you find ? Are you OK ? - I 'm more than OK . While perusing TV guide , I found a little , shall I say , flick ... starring a one Miss Dolly Parton . Yeah , it seems she made a racy film ... called / The Best / Little Whorehouse in Texas ! Yeah , Doc , you 're gonna be disappointed there ... Don 't ruin it for me ! I have popcorn popping and the VCR set for stun . - You wanna watch it with me ? - No , I 'm cool , I ... I gotta drive the boys to dinner . I get it ! Yeah , this kind of films are meant to be watched solo , mono . Yeah , that 's it . So , are they cute ? Well , Dean , he 's kinda cute . He dresses like Buddy Holly . - That 's cool . - But I think he does it accidentally . - What about my date ? - Hank ? Yeah . Well ... He 's blond , and ... more , like , athletic . - Sounds good . How does he dress ? - Like Fred from Scooby Doo . Well , put in my mix tape , it 's right on the dash . It says , " Chillin ' with my peeps , and my main man The Monarch . " We have to stop and pick up my ... date . I thought Dr. Girlfriend was gonna be there ! Yes , with that dick , Phantom Limb ! I plan to use the never-failed strategy of jealousy ! - Who 's your date ? - I met her on the / Live Journal . Which I kept in prison . I have been blogging . After posting an especially attractive picture of my prison-sculpted abs ... she commented that I was not only " lean " ... I was " to have sex " , whatever that means . Any advice ? You know , this being our first big date and all ? Yeah . - No ? - No . Don 't pull out her chair , kiss her hand , or anything like that , it 's kind of dorky . Just be yourself . Wait ! Here , take this . It 's got plenty of money , and it doesn 't have a cartoon bee on it . Don 't let them pay for anything , and if you end up going to , like , a movie ... you call me on the two-way , OK ? What about me ? Any advice to help me score with my mystery date ? Yeah , don 't say " score " or anything close to " mystery date " in front of her . And don 't do that " Do you like seafood ? " joke either . Can do ! Gosh , she would totally know that joke already . You 're awfully quiet . What ? Stop that ! And then you go , " My brother can jump over , like , ten garbage cans ! " And then I 'll say something cool , like ... " If I can keep the front wheel from bursting into flames . " OK ? And don 't forget to call me " the Hankanator . " I 'll do no such ... They 're here ! Dude , sit down ! We have to play it cool . Observe how I scope out my mystery date ... whilst I pretend to look at my watch . Holy moly , look at my date ! She 's a Supervillain ! Possibly a Medusa . Dean , I am not kidding . She has rope for hair and a shiny costume ! Not fair , she 's wearing goggles ! Told you she would dig my Batman suit , but no ! Go sit somewhere ! Watch my back and pretend you don 't know me . We 're dressed like butterflies , it 's gonna be kinda difficult . Jollyrancher82 , never get henchmen . You know , that 's not my real name . Well , how was I supposed to know ? I used / my real name . I just thought , you know , " The Monarch , " I thought you were into cos play . Real name . And I am into costume / business , not costume play . Sh ... ! They 're here ! Fawn over me ! Treat me as if I am candy ! She 's gorgeous ! She is heat incarnate . When I met her she looked like that girl Saffron from the band / Republica . She had those red streaky things in her hair . - I heard she was kind of manly . - That 's ridiculous ! Who would say such things ? The woman is a delicate flower . That dude she 's with ? That 's Phantom Limb . When he was at college , he was a scrawny little wuss . In a desperate attempt to be cooler than guys like me ... he had his 12-year old roommate create a machine that speeds up muscle-building . The machine worked so well that every molecule in his extremities ... was accelerated beyond the speed of light ! There were two side effects . One , he can mess up a guy just by touching him . And two , he became a humorless dick ! - How do you think he floats like that ? - He 's not floating , his legs are invisible . - What ? - Yeah . Used to be a good guy actually . When he and Billy , that weird midget ... won a bunch of money at / Card Sharks , invented a time machine . He became a villain , and the story is that ... the time machine was , like , broken or something . So Phantom Limbs ' arms and legs and Billy 's hand ... were sent 40 years into the future . - I loved / Card Sharks ! - Great show . - That guy 's , like , just a torso . - Yeah ! That 's Phantom Limb . I don 't think he professionally hates my dad , but he totally hates my dad . I think he used to be a famous magician . And one time , while performing for the Queen of England ... he accidentally made his arms and legs disappear . They 're now on the moon , with a whole bunch of rabbits and doves ... and playing cards and pretty assistants and some milk . - Never happened . - Did ! I also heard that he sliced off a kid 's hand . And ate it ! Yeah . It was that bigheaded guy ... that operated on your balls , Dean . Hank , don 't you have to go to the bathroom ? What are you , psychic ? I totally do ! Weird ! Well ladies ... seems that young Dean here needs an escort to the bathroom . If there 's any trouble , you just give Hank here a holler . Now this one allows the holder to watch three separate scientists . Headquarters insurance , with the exception of bog or volcano hideouts ... full henchmen coverage , and a nice little mutiny clause . Whatever ! Just give me the one that lets me take down Venture ! We like to keep our dreams small , don 't we ? Fine , another 38 with henchmen . Look who 's talking ! The Great Phantom Limb ! The most deadly villain of all time , my ass ! You 're in granny glasses , selling me insurance ! - Keep it down , please . - I 'll have you know ... I could take the entire Venture family out with one phone call ! Sure you could ! That family 's indestructible ! - I dare you ! - Fine ! I need an immediate blackout . Four , and a robot . Syndicate number , Victor . Echo . November . Seven-Niner . Roger , dispatching Blackout Team now . - What are you doing ? - I hate that song . Niner , nice touch . Within the hour ... the entire Venture family ... will be dead . Come on ! Not again ! I need you in the panic room , The compound is on full lock-down . I am this close to seeing Dolly 's goods ! I mean , they can 't sing forever ! Honestly , this nonsense happens once a week , I 'm not gonna ... - Why are you naked ? - To prey on their fear . Move like an animal to feel the kill . Right , now you 're scaring me . What 's going on ? I don 't know . But judging from these goggles , it 's the Guild . Seems like you made it to the big league , what did you do ? Nothing , I was just sitting here watching the worst porno ever . Is that a head ? Don 't be a nervous nellie . The generators 'll kick in in ... There you go . This is different , Brock . Isn 't it ? We might not win this one . You get to the panic room ! OK . Just let me finish peeing on myself . H.E.L.P. ER , institute tactical and defensive weaponry . Escort the doctor to the panic room ! Well , isn 't this wonderful ? My favorite part is when / you decided to kill the Venture family . No , wait ! It was when / your fake date ran off crying ! - Come on , Monarch , how old was she ? - Will you look at me ? I 'm in a f ... butterfly costume . What age group do you think is attracted to me ? Super . Well , if you gentlemen will excuse me ... I 'm going to powder my nose , or whatever the / cliché is . Nice one ! Look what you did ! Yeah . I did that . Strange , you almost can 't feel it . No , don 't move . The knife is still in you , the blade right between the kidney and the spleen . - Just a twitch ... - It feels almost cold . You tell me your target , and I slide the knife out . You might live , or ... Blackout . Four and a robot . Good boy . I think you may have got the kidney . I don 't wanna die alone . - Don 't go . - I don 't think I hit your kidney . No , no , you totally did . Please , hold me . I 'm pretty sure I missed the kidney . You could bleed to death in , like , four hours , but ... I see a tunnel . I 'm scared . - Could you stroke my hair ? - Look , you are not gonna ... Can you sing to me ? Could you sing a / Technotronic song ? - Maybe / Pump up the Jam ? - I don 't know ... What about / Move This ? Do you know that one ? Baby let me ... All signed . Guess I 'm back in the Guild . Not that it matters , with you believing you destroyed the Venture Family . Do you love her ? Don 't do this crap . This is way too high school for me . It 's embarrassing . I 'm not letting her go . So for your sake , I hope you do . I hope you don 't . H.E.L.P. ER , I need you to get the boys ! H.E.L.P. ER , the boys are in danger ! What the ? H.E.L.P. ER ! Damn it ! Doc ! Doc ! Stay in the panic room ! I have to protect the boys , Doc ! Don 't move ! I 'll be back . Totally ruined ! Special thanks to you , Hankanator ! - She 'll never talk to me again ! - You can 't hide in here all night . You have to get back on that horse . You gotta grab her and go " Triana , I 'm gonna kiss you . - Hank ... " I 'm gonna kiss you on the mouth , and you 're gonna love ... " - Hank ! - What ? ! - You have a stain . - What ? Come on ! Why does that happened ? I shook it so hard I almost hit that pink puck . - Well , did you dab ? - What ? - Dab ! Did you dab ? - No . - I dab . - I don 't . - You should dab . - Stop saying dab ! - Brock , please , Brock ! - Doc , I 'm going for the boys . - They 're a target . - Brock ? Brock ? - Doc , you OK ? - Emphatically no , Brock . - Can 't see you , what 's going on ? - I 'm on the V-com . I made it to the panic room . H.E.L.P. ER kept them off at first , but man , those guys were persistent ! Most of my blood is on the floor ... and the only thing keeping me alive is our lack of storage . If you don 't come save me , I 'm going to fire you , Brock . You gotta try to hold on , Doc . I 'll be back soon ! Brock , you 're fired . Steak fries . Always soggy . F ... - this ! Well , maybe you could put more water on it . Then it 'll look like you accidentally splashed it washing your hands . Or like I completely hauled off and whizzed all over myself . - I 'll get it . Hi , Brock . - Dean , are you safe ? Where are you ? - Yeah , we 're fine . We 're in the bathroom . - Date 's over , I 'm coming to get you . You heard ? I swear , I didn 't kiss her hand or anything . - But Hank ... - Enter ingenuity , Deano ! You 've gotta try this . It feels too good ! It feels like somebody with a fever is yelling at my pants ! - This rules ! - OK . Brock , this place is crawling with guys who hate dad . That figures . - Stay in the bathroom ! Don 't move ! - Alright ! Where did everybody go ? - When did that happen ? - It beats me . The Monarch is probably waiting in the car , he 's gonna kill us for dawdling . - Pay the bill , I gotta use the can . - I 'm not gonna stay here alone . I look like an idiot ! You just ate dinner with a guy dressed exactly like you . At least I look like a popular idiot . We need one of these at home ! It 's better than sitting sideways on a swing ! You have got to try this ! OK ? You know , like , in the pool ? - What are they doing here ? - How do I know ? - Gotta tell the boss . - I 'm not going out there . Dude , get outta here , I gotta take a Count Dooku . I swear ... My pants are on fire ! Dean ! Dean ! My pants are on fire ! Don 't ! Dude , stop wailing on my jug ! Throw water on it ! No way ! That 's what started this ! Well , then take it easy . Just dab , dab it ! Can 't believe it 's hard to kill these two . Don 't talk to me , if I push any harder I 'm gonna pop a gasket ! Pretend you 're alone . - Wait . You hear Phantom Limb ? - Blackout target ... Victor , Echo , November , Seven-Niner is in daddy 's lap . Repeat , in daddy 's lap . Call off Blackout Team . Daddy is going to put the boys to bed ... himself . Yes , I 'm going to kill them . It 's a very simple metaphor . Copy , big daddy . Quick , just play something . How many / Yazz albums do you have on here ? Control to Blackout Team , stand down . Daddy is going to put the boys to bed himself . Can I ask you a question ? Yes , I belong in here , I just have a deep voice . - OK , can I ask you another one ? - Sure . - What color lipstick is that ? - Pink poodle . It 's a matt color . They give a Guild discount . You 're in the Guild , right ? - I don 't know what the Guild means . - Tell me about it ! I don 't know anymore myself . So , do you work single , number two a man ? - I don 't really have a guy . - Well , let me give you my card . I like your look . Now , I 've had it up to here with men ... and I think we might make a nice team . Call me . Did you see that ? That woman just totally hit on me . She wasn 't hitting on you , read the card . Oh , my God ! I knew it ! She 's a Supervillain , that is so cool . She thought I was a bad guy . I am so gonna do this . Naked . - Holy crap ! - Whatever it is , we didn 't do it . I believe you . Stay here , don 't do anything . - Do you understand ? - Yes , sir . Yes , I understand , sir . Well , on the up side , I finally dropped one . Yeah , me too . Hello , Brock . I was wondering when you 'd show up . I had nothing to do with this . Phantom Nimrod was showing off in front of my girlfriend . I told him ... - Alright , stay out of this one . - No , duh ? He 's in the next stall . - He has that dickweed boss of yours . - Don 't push it . Nice ass , Samson . Brock Samson , the Venture mule . Do you always hang out naked in the men 's bathroom ? Why did you do it ? Why do men like us do anything ? Because we can . Wrong answer ! How would you like your neck to match your arms ? You take me out and the Guild of Calamitous Intent ... will rain down on you / en masse . Every woman you 've loved , every mouth you 've kissed ... every hand you 've shaken will fall dead to the ground . I 'm aware of that . So let me give you a warning . If you ever stick your goons on the Venture family ... / my family , I will ... Yes , of course . Scary , scary . It won 't happen again . Funny , what we men are capable of when we fear our women leaving us . Being a man , it 's so much easier to kill than to love . I 'm sorry . Thank you . We 're not so different , you and I. Yeah , I don 't need another " we 're not so different " speech , I get those a lot . Yes , I 'm sure you do . Then shall we just shake hands and leave as enemies ? For a minute there ... I thought you were going to do your ... killer hand thing . So did I. What happened in there ? - You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . - You wanna get dessert ? - I do ! - I 'm gonna be a Supervillain ! Yeah , I 'm gonna be Batman . Go Team Venture ! Dude , I warned you . I think I just found my first arch-enemies . Oh yeah , it 's a musical . You never get to see anything ! Here it is new , Dr. Venture . Don 't lift anything for a while or your arm might fall off . - Really ? - No , I 'm joking , but ... don 't lift anything , cause it could fall off . - Thanks , Billy . What are you doing ? - Nothing . The hand gets kinda buggy when I use it for delicate work , it 's fine now . - How did you get that thing ? - Excellent question , I 've no idea . / Ils mangent de la soupe .

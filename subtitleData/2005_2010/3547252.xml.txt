 Who 's there ? Look , I 'm warning you . This is a restricted area . If I catch you , there goes your ride pass . Stupid kids . Look , I 'm warning you . Car problems ? Nothing seems to be going right today . Today would be a good day to stay home and knit . Well , it all depends on what kind of pattern you 've bought . You got help coming ? No . Not that I know of . Just checking , Miss Prince . It wouldn 't do for you to have been followed by one of your co-workers . Believe me ... no one would suspect that it was me who leaked that confidential file . It 's going to be a pleasure dealing with a double agent who 's above reproach . Listen , it 's taken me four very long years ... to build up a sterling reputation with the IADC ... and I think it 's about time it paid off . I take it , then , you are interested in my latest offer ? I couldn 't care less about unscrambling White House phone conversations . What ? Somebody else is interested ... to the tune of $ 100,000 . Who ? That isn 't for you to know or find out . We 're going to do everything like we did it before . Only , instead of having one week to get me the information ... you have two days . Two days ? Or no deal . There 's only one person I know of that likes to work that fast . Harrison Fynch . Come on , the IADC is very much aware ... of Mr. Fynch 's domestic spying operations . They just don 't know what , when , where , or how . That should do it , lady . Do everything I told you , and you 'll be all set . I think I deserve to know who I 'm selling to . You just be real careful , and that baby will take you 100,000 miles . Yes , sir . - How did you do that ? - That ? You haven 't seen anything yet . Is it Harrison Fynch that wants to buy the information from Diana Prince ? - Yes . - Where is he ? All I know is that he is setting up a surveillance operation here . - Here ? In Washington ? - Yes . Who 's your contact in Fynch 's organization ? I 'm meeting with a man . Well , somebody 's going to meet him , I 'm afraid it won 't be you . Now , who is he ? And where is this little rendezvous to take place ? A man with a crutch . A cafeteria at Eighth and Curtis . Password ? " The pound cake 's stale , so why don 't you try the apple pie ? " Harris ... Fynch . Harrison Fynch . Thank you . Right . Harrison Fynch . Sorry , I got a mind like a sieve . My secretary says I drink so much of this stuff ... it just flushes everything right out of my brain . Let 's see now , you 're here to discuss ... What is it ... insurance ? I 'm here to discuss buying your amusement park , Mr. Gurney . Well , that 's easy . It 's not for sale . Everything is for sale , Mr. Gurney . Everything and everyone has a price . I don 't want to sell . - Perhaps not at this moment . - No . Not at any moment . Look ... my brother and I dreamed about owning a place like this ... ever since we were little kids in kindergarten . Davey , that 's my brother , he thought up practically half the rides in this place . You seen that Super Loop back there ? Davey designed that . American history class , our junior year in high school . When that Super Loop was installed here three years ago ... it put this place right on the map . So , it was your brother David who designed that Super Loop ? Right . Might almost say that , in order to make history ... old Davey had to flunk it . Well , then , perhaps it 's David I should be speaking to . No , David 's dead . Missing in action in Vietnam . Look , what I 'm trying to say , Mr. Fynch ... is that I have no reason or desire to sell . Listen ... As long as I 'm up , please . Mr. Gurney , please don 't misunderstand me . I ... The reason for my visit here today is simply to let you know ... that should a reason develop for you to want to sell ... sometime in the future ... you have ... a very eager ... and a very qualified buyer at your beck and call . I 'll tell you again , there 's no way I 'm ever going to sell . In spite of the migraines and the ulcers ... I 've got way too much invested in this place . Well , thank you for your time , Mr. Gurney . Fynch plans to set up operations in Washington ? Sounds that way . The information that I was using to bait him ... is the kind he usually likes to buy and sell . It 's top-secret , exotic , extremely valuable on the black market . But apparently , this time he was planning on keeping what he bought ... for himself . He intends to set up some kind of system ... to monitor shortwave phone conversations . That 's probably only part of his plan . With his expertise , he 'll find a way to monitor all communications . Having him headquartered in Washington ... is like having a shark in a public swimming pool . You 're not kidding . Before long , foreign countries ... are gonna know more about our government than we do . What you got , Beverly ? You know , Steve , we 've been trying to bust this guy for three years . It 's now or never . I 'm going to check with Ira ... see if he can come up with a lead as to Fynch 's next move ... - now that we know his intentions . - I think that 's a good idea . Meanwhile , I 've got - - How does he do that ? - What ? Make those noises ? No , get into rooms when all the doors are closed . I don 't know about you , but I 've been afraid to ask . Good . Come here . - Here it is . - A 50-cent piece ? It 's a bug . Something our lab boys dreamed up . Thanks to our friend Wonder Woman ... I have a little rendezvous with one of Fynch 's operatives this afternoon . And this will give us a chance to beat Harrison Fynch at his own game . And I 'm going to cash in on my newly established career as a double agent . You should learn to play chess , Mr. Pierce . Wonderful for the mind . Are you kidding ? I have enough trouble with checkers . Hold all calls . - I 'm only telling you What I saw . - What you think you saw . What I saw ! And I 'm not the only one , Mr. Gurney ! Half the kids who work here have seen it around the Super Loop . What did it do , maul you ... carry off screaming patrons , leave gigantic footprints in the concrete ? No . But there 's something in this park that shouldn 't be here . I saw it . It 's real , and it 's horrible . And it 's wrong to keep it a secret . The only thing that I 'm covering up ... is the fact that I exercise poor judgment ... when I hire guys like you to work . Now , you can this nonsense ... or I 'm going to give your job to somebody with a little more respect for the truth . I resent being called a liar , Mr. Gurney . And I resent you spreading the irresponsible rumor ... that my Fun Universe is haunted by some kind of depraved monster . The public and the press are squirrelly enough ... When it comes to amusement parks , you understand ? Someday you 're going to be real sorry you kept this thing a secret . And I intend to be around to say , " I told you so . " Something strike you funny , Mr. Fynch ? Yes , Mr. Pierce . I just discovered a way ... to force Mr. Gurney to sell me that amusement park of his . - Ms. Patrick ? - Yeah ? I heard you 're taking a bunch of kids to Fun Universe . That 's right . Can I go ? Please ? Oh , Randy ... I could only wrangle a limited number of free passes . I was going to take the younger children . You 're going to need somebody to help watch them . Well , Jeff is coming along . Let me do it . Jeff is older than you , Randy , he 's more responsible . I 'm responsible ! Please , Ms. Patrick . He 's been there before and I haven 't . They 've got roller coasters there , three of them . You and your roller coasters . Look , I can watch the kids just as good as he can . All right . We 'll be leaving at 2 : 00 sharp . Yes , ma 'am . - Sure I didn 't give them to you ? - You said you 'd take care of it yourself . I distinctly remember putting them in a manila envelope . I 'll write up some new passes , the kids will just have to wait . All right , we got " O " for orphanage ... Never mind , Mr. Gurney . I 'll take care of it . Nothing . " P. " Patrick Home for Boys . Twelve ride passes . What did I tell you ? - I 'm telling you . - Yeah , I know . Flushes everything right out ofmy brain . It appears our friend Mr. Gurney is a bit of a philanthropist . I 'll have to remember that when I take over his amusement park . Good for my image . Your move , Mr. Pierce . Like I said , Mr. F ... checkers is hard enough . I don 't get this game . Play . When is your appointment , by the way ? Told Thorpe I 'd meet him in about half an hour . Randy , come on . The pound cake is stale , why don 't you try the apple pie ? I had the apple pie yesterday . It 's not that good . I know you expected the password to be given by a man , Mr. Pierce . But When I have information to sell ... I don 't use a go-between . I don 't know what you 're talking about ... Diana . Why don 't you have a seat ? Okay , so you know who I am , and I know who you are . You must also know ... what kind of information I have to sell you . Not interested . Well , Mr. Fynch might think differently . After all , Thorpe did trust me enough ... to allow me to take his place at this little rendezvous . My boss likes things done his way . Your being here in person isn 't part ofhis plan . So ... Pleasure . Excuse me , sir . You have left your change . Got him . Let 's arrange a meeting so that you can at least talk to Fynch . Okay ? Let 's just say the deal 's off . Thanks , lady . Ms. Patrick ? Tommy says he lost his ride pass . He said the string broke and it blew away . He must have been playing with it . Where were you when this happened , Randy ? You 're supposed to be watching them , that 's why you 're along . Look , just tell me where to go and I 'll get him another one . Those passes were donated to us . I 'm not going to have the park owner think we 're taking advantage ... by asking for another one . Tommy is just going to have to suffer the consequences of your unreliability . My ... Here , take mine . But you so much as touch it , I 'll break your arms . - Now , tell me . Which way did yours blow ? - That way . I 'll be right back . You better go on and catch up with the others ... so you don 't get lost and I get blamed for that , too . Hey ... is anybody there ? Is anybody down here ? I 'll never get out of here . Is somebody there ? Is anybody down here ? Hello ? Yeah . Diana , lunch is ready . Come on in . - Listen to this . - We got a feed ? I take back all the rotten things I ever said about the lab boys . That 50-cent piece works like a charm . - Great , is the tape rolling ? - Sure is . Let 's eat . But it wasn 't Thorpe who showed up . It was that Prince woman herself . Good pickles . Said she didn 't need any middleman . I told her to forget it ... you don 't do business that way . He must be talking to Fynch . Then I got out of there . I 'll tell you something , though . That Diana Prince is a heck of a lot better-looking in real life ... than she is in pictures . Well , I 'm sure there are many people outside the IADC ... who can supply me with the technical information I 'll require , Mr. Pierce . Right now , however ... you will find a bomb ... Yeah , I can pick it up . I 'm only about two miles from there . What kind of bomb is it , and where do I plant it ? Fine . But tell me ... what is a Crazy Wheel ? Mr. Pierce , it 's a sort of a Ferris wheel . You 'll find the name to be quite appropriate once you 've seen it . Poor Mr. Gurney . He 's just discovered ... a youngster has disappeared from his amusement park . Last night , a monster , today , a missing orphan ... tomorrow , a terrible accident . It appears that bad luck does run in threes , Mr. Pierce . Pretty soon he 'll beg you to buy his place . Talk to you tomorrow , Mr. Fynch . After the noon news . This is the biggest break we 've ever had , Diana . We nail him planting that bomb ... and it 's the beginning of the end for Mr. Fynch . What , you know where they intend to plant it ? Take a look at this . Ira 's been theorizing just how Fynch might go about ... setting up a major surveillance operation here in Washington . According to what we just heard , this is the most likely possibility . Isn 't that Fun Universe Amusement Park ? It 's the perfect cover for him . It 's a legitimate enterprise , constant crowds , lots of diversions . Perfect place for agents to rendezvous and pass information . And since we already know that Fynch is particularly fond ... - of microwave phone conversations - - Yes . That tower would be a perfect place to set up monitoring equipment . - And that 's the Crazy Wheel . - Yeah . Which they apparently intend to sabotage ... in order to encourage the park owners to sell out . You 've checked all the rest rooms , all the concession booths ? Okay , here 's what I want . I want you to post three guards at every exit until closing time . If he isn 't found then , I want you to organize a dragnet . Are you certain that that boy didn 't leave the park ... and hitchhike home ? No . Randy would never have left until the absolutely last minute . He was fascinated by the rides here . The roller coasters in particular , and especially that one . All right . I 'll double-check security around the roller coaster grounds . No offense , Mr. Gurney , but I think it 's time the police were notified . There 's no need for that . My people will find him . Your people were trained to run an amusement park ... not to find lost children . May I ? Who 's there ? Who is it ? ... in a tool case . He 's going in as a member of the cleanup crew . I 'm following . Wait a minute . You sure you don 't need some help ? If you lose him , we 'll have to tell the park not to open . Then Fynch 'll know we 're on to him . I have no intention of losing him , Steve . Wait ! Please , don 't be frightened . It 's all right . You 're gonna help me get out of here ? I can 't let you leave . What are you going to do with me ? I don 't know . We had a team out looking for him all last night . And no , the boy is definitely not in the park . Nothing like this has ever happened before . Look , didn 't I already answer that question ? What do you want ? There 's a Diana Prince out here to see you . I never heard ofher . Give her an appointment two years from today . Mr. Gurney . Kidnapping ? Listen ... you use that word on your newscast , you got yourself a libel suit , buddy ! Did you ever ride the Super Loop ? If so , in a way ... I was there . See , I designed this ride . I know it better than anybody up top . I know where it 's likely to weaken ... they don 't . So I keep tabs on it from down here . I try to let them know where they should make repairs . My name 's Dave . It 's not contagious . What happened to you ? Vietnam . I was flying in a chopper filled with napalm . I let everyone think the explosion had killed me . You see , my brother ... owns the amusement park upstairs . Having a face like mine around isn 't too good for business . Unless you want to charge a buck a stare . Besides ... he 's got enough problems as it is . What 's that ? That 's some kind of bomb . Trevor . Hi . Diana ! How 'd it go ? I 've got some good news and some bad news . Preference as to order ? Yeah , give me the good news first . Okay , Fynch 's man was not able to plant that bomb in the park . You recovered it ? You sitting down yet ? Where is it ? Still in the park ? I think so . What do you mean , you think so ? It 's a long story , Steve . Listen , I 'm going to grab a late breakfast and head on in . Any developments ? You didn 't happen to see a missing teenager in the park , did you ? No , I sure didn 't . Okay . Okay . I 'll talk to you later . Yeah , that 's real good . Run off about 200 of these . - Post them around the park . - Will do . By the way , you got a call earlier from Mr. Fynch . Who 's that ? He said he was here yesterday . He gave me his phone number ... - wanted to make sure you had it . - Probably about insurance . Please , make this phone stop ringing . I got nothing to say to anybody . I 'm afraid that 's not quite true , Mr. Gurney . How could it not be true , Sergeant ? We spent three hours talking with each other last night . That was before I did some talking to some of your employees . Now , what is this they tell me about a monster in the park ? Money is no object ... as long as you can assure me the job will be done immediately . I realize she 's an IADC agent . I realize that , too . Why do you suppose no one has ever succeeded ? No . It 's because no one has ever said , " Get Diana Prince , whatever the cost . " I 'm saying it to you , am I not ? She 's been interfering with my affairs , and I want her dead ... by the end of the day . Whatever it takes . Fine . I 'll be waiting .

 Previously on " Fringe " Olivia Dunham , FBI They are calling these events a Pattern as someone out is doing experiment , only the whole world is a lab Anybody you need you can have . His name is Walter Bishop . My father . He worked out at Harvard . He was part of classified U.S. army experimental programe ... in the area called " Fringe Science " You are telling me , my father is Dr. Frankstan ? So much happened here , so much is about . Can I get you some coffee ? Roast beef sandwich on a roll . Meat raw as possible . Room temperature water . - No ice . - Gotcha . - Do you have jalapenos ? - I think he does . 11 of those , please . On the side . 11 ... You got it . What is that ? That language , is that , like , Korean or something ? No . Good . I had Asian studies at cuny . Thought I really missed something . Help ! Watch out ! Move . Move now ! Right now . Move , move , it 's gonna hit us ! Watch out ! It 's coming - It has arrived . 150 grams of sucrose , maintained at 70 degrees fahrenheit for 120 hours . 30 milliliters at 80 degrees ... What formula are you rattling off at 3 : 00 in the morning ? The formula for root beer . Root beer . That 's what 's so important you couldn 't stop yourself from broadcasting . I haven 't had it for ages . I thought I might make some in the lab tomorrow . Where are you going ? It occurs to me it might be easier to sleep in the tub . A root beer float . Delicious . Next time , would you please drain the tub ? Oh , yes . Indeed . - I know how to get there . - I need you to slow down . Her office is right up here . I 've been there before . Sir , you don 't have clearance to walk here unescorted . Peter . We need to talk . Is that okay with you ? Do I have clearance to talk to her ? It 's okay . I got it . Come with me . - Where is your father ? - Walter is at the hotel . But don 't worry , your agents are standing guard . Not that it matters , ' cause the man is unconscious . He was awake till 5 : 00 in the morning , reciting the chemical compositions of his favorite beverages to me . That was right after he finished lecturing me on how I 'd squandered my above-average intellect and my substantial education , all while he was standing there naked . Well , your living arrangements are temporary . We 're finding you an apartment so that - Olivia , don 't bother . I wanted to help . I felt bad . I still feel bad about what happened to you . But the truth is , you don 't need me here . - That isn 't the truth . - It is . Things are happening here . Strange things that need investigating , that connect somehow to the insane work that Walter was doing way back when , but he 's the one with the answers . You need him . I 'm just a babysitter . Peter , you decipher what he says . Things that other people can 't even follow . No , not any more . Anybody can do that . There 's nothing special about me . You 're his son . That 's not the only thing . I don 't do well staying in one place . You know that . This isn 't the job for me . If you leave , so does he . Really ? You 're telling me that if the federal government wants to get Walter Bishop out of a mental institution , they can 't do that without the consent of his son ? It 's your father . He 's made it very clear that if you leave , he won 't cooperate with our investigations . I don 't believe it . He would rather go back to st . Claire 's than work here without you . He said that more than once . Was he wearing clothes at the time ? - Good morning . - Hello . Hello . Morning . Yesterday , there was an explosion at a construction site in Williamsburg , Brooklyn . A crane collapsed . Left three dead , two dozen injured . The public was told that it was a gas main explosion , which , technically , is the truth . It 's what caused the explosion I want you to see . We had it transported here late last night . We 've got NSA and CDC gathering data . But Dr. Bishop , I wanted you to see this as soon as possible . What is it ? It 's why you 're here . We don 't know . It just fell from the sky ? It came from underground . The thing blasted through an unused subway tunnel into a gas main . Underground . Cameo rest right on the surface . As if someone had carefully placed it there . Solid iridium . We think so , yes . Subsonic vibrations ? At two megahertz , and then again at four . This thing is vibrating ? Dr. Bishop , do you have an idea what this may be ? An idea , yes . Do you feel like sharing ? No. it 's too early . This isn 't the first time one of these has shown up . 1987 . At Quantico . Colonel Jacobson was in charge of the investigation . Henry Jacobson ? Spoke to him myself this morning . He 's expecting a visit . Said hs looking forward to seeing you again . What do you wanna do ? What kind of man would take off on you the minute a can of magic space soup arrives ? Who says it came from space ? - It 's a joke , Walter . - Oh . Thank you for staying . This is the last one , Olivia . Then I 'm gone . We need to get this back to the lab . We can 't risk transferring this to the university . We 'd rather you st - If you require my perspicacity such as it exists , then there are certain fundamental requirements , not the least of which is access to my equipment , my lab ... Well , well , well . I was hoping I 'd have an excuse to see you again . It 's good to see you . Oh . It 's been more than a year since she died . It 's still difficult . I suppose it always will be . Jessica took care of the house . Hell , she took care of everything . I apologize for what has to be horrible coffee . No , it 's delicious . I know you lost someone too . My condolences . It 's not easy losing a partner . I know agent Scott and you were close . What can you tell me about Quantico ? 1987 ? Master Sergeant Stuart Malick . He was at his post at the marine base on the night of June 22 . His job was to watch the motion sensors , perimeter security , to ensure that there was no breach at the base . Except on that night , the sensors went nuts . What we found was this . Metallic cylinder , 24 inches tall , 12 inches in diameter . He assumed it fell from the sky . That perhaps it was a piece of a satellite . Except it wasn 't . Stranger still , although it seemed to be a solid pie of hard metal , it was vibrating . At two megahertz . Then again at four . There 's another ? Where is this one ? Still at Quantico ? I was called in to investigate . We determined it was transmitting something . A signal that we couldn 't decode . 48 hours after we found it , there was an explosion unlike anything I 'd ever seen . It went through the floor to the basement below . It exploded down . And was gone . I 'll give you my files , whatever you need . But this was a weird one , Olivia . And if it 's happening again , as a friend , I 'd ask you to stay as far away from this thing as you can . And what exactly is this ? In time , my dear . Hello , sir , can I help you ? Code red , code red . We have a breach in sector eight . You . Where is it ? Agent Dunham . Hello ? Hello ? Olivia . Hello ? Olivia . John ? Dispatch . This is agent Dunham . 7-18-6-22-7-9 . I need a call traced from my cell . It just came in . Please hold . We have no record of any calls in the last three hours . Oh . I 'm sorry . Okay . Thank you . The precision with which this object was constructed is inspiring . Down to the molecular bonds . I sure hope that a gigantic metallic suppository is not the pinnacle of human achievement . What is it ? Let me ask you a question . If I tried reverse psychology , like , if I just said to you right now , " Walter , don 't tell me what that is , " Would that work ? Many years ago , I worked on project Thor . The Department of Defense wanted a subterranean torpedo , a missile which could , in theory , be shot from anywhere in the world through the earth 's core and hit its target on the other side . I know for a fact that that is ridiculous . Open your mind , son , or someone may open it for you . Even that doesn 't make any sense . The cylinder could be any number of things , none of which I am prepad to discuss . Great , well , I am glad I stuck around for this . I don 't believe it . What ? Look . It 's one of the photos from Jacobson 's file . Him . Remember ? The bald guy . No , who is he ? That 's the point . Olivia , you 're starting to sound like Walter . There are many things I 'm not good at , too many , but one thing I can do , that I 've always been able to do , that game , concentration . Memory . Connecting things . Putting them together . See . Two weeks ago at the hospital . That 's him . No way . Can I help you ? Still photograph from the crime scene at Quantico , 1987 . Look . He was there . Look at this . Less than two weeks ago at the hospital in Quincy . It 's the same guy . And he looks the same . And he was there with us . What ? Come with me . Excuse us , please . It took us a year to spot him . You did it in three weeks . Who the hell is this guy ? That is one excellent question . You 've run him through every database ? - Of course . - And there 's nothing on him ? - Nothing at all ? - No positive I.D. We 've recorded him at over three dozen scenes , all of which relate to The Pattern . How ? Why ? What is he doing ? What it looks like he 's doing . He 's watching . Observing . Which is why we refer to him as the observer . But what he wants and why he 's there , we don 't know . And he was there the other day ? In New York at the construction site ? This is Broyles . When did it happen ? Okay , turn it on . What is that ? It 's called sound . I know that , thank you . What 's the point ? I need to compare the numbers , confirm my suspicions . Compare them to what ? Suspicions of what ? Astrid Farnsworth . - I 'll explain later . - No , I want you to explain right now . I want to know what the hell this tin can is . Peter ? It 's Olivia . Hello ? There 's been an attack , Peter . The team at the warehouse is dead . What ? Who did it ? I don 't know , but we 're moving that thing to a secure facility . I 'm on my way . Got it . Walter , whatever the hell that thing is , you should have never brought it here . Why do you say this ? Has someone come for it ? Why would you ask that ? - Have they ? - Yes . Then we need to keep this safe . We need something - something very important . - What ? - Aluminum foil . - Why ? - Trust me . - No , thank you . - Damn it ! Must you always be such a smart ass ? I need the aluminum foil right now to shield the frequencies of the cylinder . Your life depends on it . All our lives depend on it . Go now . I 'm gonna go get you your aluminum foil , and then when I get back , you 're gonna tell me what the hell it is you think that thing does . While you 're out , if you see a chance to get me a root beer float , that would be wonderful . I 'll see what I can do . Would you be a lamb and get me that syringe ? Sure . Thank you . I got the tin foil ! Astrid ! Astrid ! Hey ! Astrid ! Astrid ! Are you okay ? Astrid , look at me , Astrid . Hey , focus , focus for a second . Where is Walter ? Someone came to you . Think about her . I know you were there . The last time . And she 's come to you now . Think about that woman . Don 't play with me . Now you tell me now , or I 'll do that again . Think . See ? That was easy . Bless you . I haven 't had a root beer float in 17 years . And ? How is it ? Heavenly . And earthly at the same time . Quite the connoisseur . Do you want some ? No , thank you . I wouldn 't taste much anyway . 17 years . That 's a long time to go without something you love . Where I 've been , you lose track of time . So much now to make up for . Thank you for hiding the beacon . I can 't touch it myself . I know you have questions . Soon you 'll have answers . Of course . Dr. Walter Bishop , I 'm forwarding his photo right now . I want surveillance posted outside his last known residence . Please do not stand there and tell me - that you have no idea where your father - - You 're assuming I have any understanding of how that man 's addled brain works . You gave us the impression that you could handle him . Hey , let 's get something straight . I didn 't promise you anything . I warned you from the word go . Agent Dunham . Thank god . Where ? We 'll be right there . Walter just got picked up , walking the median of I-95 . If it 's possible , I would ve much like my own clothes back . Let me explain how this works to you , Walter . You can 't inject a Federal Officer with sedatives , steal government property , and then escape from protective custody , and then ask to be not treated like a criminal . Have you never taken anything that didn 't belong to you because you knew it was the right thing to do ? This isn 't about me . Maybe it is , Peter . You took the cylinder . Do you remember that ? Yes , of course . What would you like to know about it ? - Where is it ? - I can 't tell you that . But I can tell you that someone is coming to seek the cylier . Thus , I had to hide it . And I don 't recall where or from whom . We need you to remember . It may be dangerous , and we need to help keep people safe . Tell me what it is . If I-if I attempted to explain it , you-you might think me mad . Don 't worry . There 's no chance of that happening . I believe there are only another four hours in which I must keep the cylinder from those who are trying to get it , a theory I have discussed with my friend , who agrees with me . Your friend ? Um , he 's a tall fellow , right ? Pink , big fuzzy ears . No , he 's a man . Quite nice . Albeit extremely bald . No eyebrows either . It 's disturbing , but you get accustomed to it . You talked to him . Do you really think it 's a good idea to feed into his delusions at this point ? Walter , who is he ? Where can we find him ? Oh , you won 't be able to find him . Oh , of course not , ' cause he 's in the seventh dimension . He 's shy . Though he wouldn 't be any use to you He just observes . Walter , you haven 't talked to this man . You 've seen him in Olivia 's photographs , so cut out the gibberish and just tell us where the cylinder is . Must you always be so small-minded ? Damn it , don 't be like her . Like your mother . Questioning my judgment . I am not a child . I will not be babied . Thank you for that . That 's exactly what I needed . Guilt relieved . Olivia , I am very sorry , but I think you 'll understand why I don 't want to hang around any longer . I upset him , didn 't I ? Where are we ? I couldn 't tell you . Walter 's hiding something . He 's being as cryptic as ever . He says he had to keep the cylinder safe . That someone is looking for it . Welcome to the joys of Walter Bishop . Where did he take it ? You 'll have to ask Walter . He won 't tell me . Apparently , he had a meeting with a man matching the description of our friend . The bald guy . Well , I know a lot of bald guys . The observer . Are you saying Walter 's saying he knows him ? I 'm saying he 's not cooperating . I 'm saying I 'm confused . Hey , man . Thanks for calling me back so fast . Look , don 't start with me right now , okay ? Well , guess what , I 'm calling this time to ask for a favor too . Nah , I need some work . Well , I don 't really care . As long as it puts some money in my pocket . Anywhere but Boston . Agent Dunham ? Agent farnsworth is on the phone . I don 't know . About an hour ago ? When he lie , he was pretty upset with Walter . Maybe he just finally left . No , there was a struggle here . I 'll check it out . Thanks , Astrid . Call Harvard campus security . There 's a closed-circuit camera outside countway library aimed at the kresge building . I need footage going back two hours . You don 't work for big eddie , do you ? Look , I think you got the wrong guy . What I 'm saying is ... Whatever it is you want , I don 't think I 'm gonna be able to give it to you . No , no ! Aah ! You have something I need . Tell me where it is . I have no idea what you 're talking about . I 'm going to ask you some questions . Please answer honestly . What 's the most pain you 've ever felt in your life ? This was taken outside your lab . Have you ever seen this man before ? I don 't believe so , no . So something happened , yes ? Something unfortunate . What is it ? I believe this man may have abducted Peter . That 's not - no . Peter will lead him to it . To what ? The cylinder ? - Yes . - How ? Did you tell him where you put it ? No , of course not . I don 't need to . You and your colleagues had the cylinder last . Where is it now ? I have no idea . and even if I did , you 're the last person I would tell . But you just did tell me . Your father hid it . You don 't know where ? And yes , to answer your question , when this is over , I just might kill you . It depends on a few things . When was the last time your father kissed you ? I think that 's your lamest question yet . Think about your father . Good . Now think about a time before he was sent away to the institution . A happy time , a time when you still believed that your father loved you . Beside his car in your old house , does your father have any other hiding places ? Answer the question . Does your father ha - Thank you . You just told me where the cylinder is . Come with me . Shame you never met him . Come on . Dig . Careful . Hey , Olivia . Over here . Are you okay ? Yeah . He went that way . Go ! He 's got a gun . Departure on schedule . Who the hell are you ? What is the cylinder ? - You know what it is , don 't you ? - You know what it is , don 't you ? - Why is it here ? - Why is it here ? - Why now ? - Why now ? - Who are you ? - Who are you ? - Apples , bananas , rhinoceros . - Apples , bananas , rhinoceros . - I want to hold your hand . - I want to hold your hand . - Lucy in the sky with diamonds . - Lucy in the sky with diamonds . Do you really know my father ? Did you talk to him this afternoon ? Are you his friend ? Peter . - Is he all right ? - He 's fine . He has a mild concussion , but he 's gonna be fine . Thank you . That 's wonderful news . Come on . I 'm gonna take you back to your hotel . If you don 't mind , there 's something I 'd like to do first . What I did to you was very untrustworthy of me . I never intended to harm you . I was simply doing what was necessary to protect us all . If it would help you feel a sense of retribution , I would tell you to inject me too . But I 'd most likely enjoy it . Hi , Peter Bishop , he was brought in about an hour ago . Excuse me . Hi . Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . So did we recover the cylinder ? We dug out the hole , but there 's no sign of it . As soon as the sun comes up , We 'll bring in an excavator , But somehow , I don 't have an expectation we 'll find it . So it just disappeared . We I.D. ' d the shooter . John Mosley . Wanted for a double homicide in Seattle last month . A few drug-related felonies before that . Seattle . Came a long way to try and get that thing . Another in a long line of questions . I should get back . As you can imagine , there are some interagency fires to quash . NSA considered that device their personal property . They 're looking for an explanation . So I 'll see you tomorrow ? Yeah . Hi . You ready to get out of here ? Something happened out there tonight , Olivia . The Pattern that Broyles refers to , I always thought it was nonsense . Inexplicable things happen every single day . It does not mean that there 's any deeper significance . I know this is gonna sound insane . Yeah , I know it sounds insane , but that man out there in the woods , He knew me . And I don 't know how , but he was inside my head . He knew what I was going to say before I said it . The man I shot ? No , the other guy , the bald guy . From your photos . Mr. no brows ? Peter , I didn 't see anyone . You know me well enough now to know that these are the last words I would ever expect to to be saying , but what if Walter is right ? What if this is just the beginning ? Listen , you took a pretty bad blow to the head . You think I did this to myself ? No , I just - I was wrong to - to demand that you stay here . Walter is not your respoibility . As you 've always said , this was just supposed to be temporary . You have your life . Olivia , did you hear what I just said ? I mean , I 'm a fairly open-minded guy , but there are things happening here that I can 't even begin to explain . And I am not going anywhere until I can . In that case , you might want this . Your credentials have been approved . Civilian consultant to the Department of Homeland Security . Does this mean I don 't need an escort to come into the Federal building anymore ? Yeah . Will it get me out of speeding tickets ? Maybe . So let me tell you about my day , Walter . I was abducted , tortured , had two wires shoved up my nose that were connected to a machine I 've never seen before . But maybe the strangest part of the day is that somehow , without talking , I was able to answer a question that I didn 't have the answer to . Where I buried the capsule ? How did I know that , Walter ? I didn 't know that . You know it , son , because I know it . No , I didn 't know because you didn 't tell me . I didn 't have to . You must adjust the way you consider communications , ideas . Ideas can be absorbed through osmosis . Through proximity . Do you remember the night of the accident when you were young ? - I was driving - - Of course , I remember . Your mother was at home . Of course , I remember . Thanksgiving dinner . She was anxious for us to get there , join everyone . When the car went off the road , the ice was so thick that it held the vehicle for what must have been two minutes . What does this have to do with what happened today ? I regained consciousness , I saw your body ... contorted horribly , and I reached for you . But the ice broke . And we sank into that dark water . And then you swam to shore and saved us both . I know . No . I was unable to control my limbs in that icy water . It wouldn 't respond . I was incapable of saving you . Or myself . We were dead , Peter , you and I. Until someone grabbed me . And we were going up . We were saved , both of us , by a man that I had never met . A man that shouldn 't have been there at all . He pulled us to the shore . I remembered that he was bald , that he had no eyebrows . And as he set us down in the snow , I recalled his stare , standing there in his suit soaking wet , seemingly indifferent to the cold . It was as if he knew my thoughts before I did . As if he were side my head . Without speaking , he made it clear that he would need me one day . A return favor , so to speak . And this is it . Today , what happened with the capsule , I 'm not sure how I knew about the vibrations , the composition . But then when I tested it myself , heard the vibrations , felt them , It was as if an envelope had been opened and I could finally read my instructions . Instantly , I knew I had to protect the capsule . For him . Who they are , what they want - As a man of science , I share your frustration in not having these answers . But what I know is that you are sitting here now ... My son ... alive . I know you must think me insane . Not nearly as much as you might think . Hello , Liv .

 MOHINDER : Where does it come from ? This quest , this need to solve life 's mysteries , when the simplest of questions can never be answered ? Why are we here ? What is the soul ? Why do we dream ? Perhaps we 'd be better off not looking at all . Not delving , not yearning . That 's not human nature . Not the human heart . That is not why we are here . How 's he doing ? I 'm sorry . Did I scare you ? No . No , I just ... I keep having these amazing dreams every time I close my eyes , and ... Never mind . He likes me to read him the stock page . Has he been conscious at all ? No . Been a week now . I think he 's close . A couple more days , maybe . Excuse me . You know , I don 't know what he 'd do without you . You got a real gift . Just doing my job . No , you 're like a son to him . Now , that 'd make us like brother and sister . Might be ... Might be a Iittle awkward if I ever wanted to ask you out . I 'm sorry , that was ... That was inappropriate . No , it 's sweet , it 's ... I 'm dating somebody . Yeah . No , really , it 's okay . I need to change his IV . I 'm sorry , of course . Man is a narcissistic species by nature . We have colonized the four corners of our tiny planet . But we are not the pinnacle of so-called evolution . That honor belongs to the lowly cockroach . Capable of living for months without food . Remaining alive headless for weeks at a time . Resistant to radiation . If God has indeed created himself in his own image , then I submit to you that God is a cockroach . They say that man uses only a tenth of his brainpower . Another percent and we might actually be worthy of God 's image . Unless , of course , that day has already arrived . The Human Genome Project has discovered that tiny variations in man 's genetic code are taking place at increasingly rapid rates . Teleportation , Ievitation , tissue regeneration . Is this outside the realm of possibility ? Or is man entering a new gateway to evolution ? Is he finally standing at the threshold to true human potential ? I 'm sorry , I 'm out of time . I know , I know . I 'm beginning to sound like my father . I can 't help it . You know , they can fire me , too , if they like , but there is something to it , Nirad , as crazy as it sounds . What is it ? It 's your father . He 's dead . How ? NIRAD : Driving a taxi in New York City is a very dangerous job . The wrong fare , the wrong time . We may never know what really happened . No , I spoke to him two days ago . He was convinced someone was following him , trying to steal his research . He died because of his theories ! That 's crazy ! Is it ? The man left his family , discredited his career , to chase wild theories halfway around the world ! Where are you going ? To his apartment , to get his papers , his research ! He was this close to finding the first of them . His Patient Zero , he tracked him to Queens , New York . Mohinder , listen to me . Your father was my colleague and my friend . A respected professor , a brilliant geneticist . But he had clearly lost touch with reality ! I 've followed in his footsteps . My thesis is based on his research ! Yes , you always wanted his approval ! And now you 're telling me that it was all for nothing . I 'm telling you to let go . I need to know why he died . I need to know that it wasn 't all for nothing . And then I need to finish what he started . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Hello ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm at his place now . No , no , no , he left everything behind but his computer . Research , the map . Yeah , Iet 's get a team in here to bag and tag everything . I gotta call you right back . ( MUSTANG SALLY PLAYING ) ( BEEPING ) Pervert . Time to get up , Micah ! Micah ! Micah ! Micah ! Micah ! What ? Damn it , Micah , don 't do that to me . Do what ? Just you need to be careful . AII right ? I 'm just working on my computer . The logic board was bad , so I had to build a new one . A new one . Did anyone ever tell you you 're the smartest little man on the planet ? You do . AII the time . What 's this ? It 's a pinhole camera . It 's for the eclipse . The moon 's gonna cover up the sun today . We 're supposed to look at it at school . Speaking of which , you need to go get ready . Can 't be late , not today . Mom , I 'm already dressed and I 've packed my own lunch . That 's what I 've been doing this morning . What about you ? Don 't get smart with me . AII right , I 've been working to pay our bills . Yeah , that 's why they turned off our gas again ? ( DOORBELL RINGING ) Go grab your stuff and wait by the back door , okay ? Why ? Just do it . Mom , what 's going on ? Never mind , just keep your voice down and stay close to me . ( POUNDING ON DOOR ) Camera ready ? MAN : Yeah , almost ! Hold on ! This looks like 70 , 80 feet . This is so unreal . Okay , I 'm good ! Okay . Oh my ... ( SCREAMING ) Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! claire ? Oh , my God . claire ! This is claire Bennet and that was attempt number six . DRIVER : You get out here , yes ? Mr. Linderman , I 'm gonna have to call you back in five minutes , okay ? Thank you . I 'm late . I 've got a fundraiser and a drinks meeting . What is it ? It happened two more times . Sometimes I 'm falling , sometimes I 'm flying . Sometimes you 're in ' em . I don 't have time for this now . They 're not just dreams , Nathan ! Hold this . I thought they 'd go away , but they 're not ! Jim , I need this back by 6 : 00 , please . Thanks . This morning when I got out of bed , my foot hovered before it hit the ground . Hovered ! For a split second , Iike I was floating . I 'm telling you , I think I can fly ! These all undecideds ? Mmm-hmm . Tell you what , you think you can fly ? Why don 't you jump off the Brooklyn Bridge ? See what happens . Maybe I ought to start with something a Iittle lower first . Just like learning to walk . You 're serious . Oh , I 'm serious . You need to snap out of it , Peter . Go see a doctor , get some drugs . But do not pull a Roger clinton on me , man , I 'm eight points down in the polls ! Look , this isn 't about you , all right ? Look , something is happening to me , and I have this feeling that you 're the only person that 's gonna understand this ! Why the hell would I understand that you think you can fly ? ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Because you 're my brother ! Mom , I can 't talk ... What ? I 'II be there in 10 minutes . What 'd she do now ? She got arrested . Arrested for what ? Shoplifting . I 'm so depressed . What ? What are you talking about ? Why ? I mean , I mean , besides the fact that it was so gross that I almost fudged myself , this is the single coolest thing to happen to this town in , Iike , 100 years . Not if nobody finds out , it 's not . Why 'd you want me to tape it ? I have my reasons . It 's not Iike you 're not gonna be popular anymore . Popular ? Who said anything about being popular ? My life as I know it is over , okay ? I 've got the Bishop game next week , SAT 's in October , Homecoming 's three weeks from today , and I 'm a freak show ! You 're being a Iittle dramatic , don 't you think ? No , I don 't think ! I have busted , Iike , every bone in my body , stabbed myself in the chest , I 've shoved a two-foot steel rod through my neck , and I don 't have a scratch on me ! What do you call that thing sticking out ? Oh , great . Just give me the tape , okay ? Sure . Hey , I can give you a ride on my handlebars if you want . ( SIGHING ) Look , thanks , okay ? I 'II talk to you in front of people at school tomorrow . Promise . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( MUSTANG SALLY PLAYING ) Your son is a very intelligent boy . Gifted , actually . That 's not the issue . His father 's not around , and sometimes I think he could use a bit of a stronger hand , you know ? I work nights a Iot , but we can both work harder . It 's not about the work . The truth is , I just don 't know if this school is the right fit for him . But he 's made friends . I 'm sorry . He 's on the soccer team . I 'm sorry . I wrote a check for $ 25,000 to get him into this snob fest . I was told that that 's what it took . That 's on top of the tuition . About the tuition . Your last three checks have bounced . Fine , take it out of the 25 grand that I gave you . That was a donation . And it was very appreciated . Well , I want my money back . I want my money back , now . That money went to the capital campaign for the new wing . It 's already been spent . Then unspend it ! I 'm sorry . We could maybe discuss an extension of the money that you owe , but ... I want my money back . That 's not possible . Come on , baby , Iet 's get out of here . You 're too good for this lousy school . Mom ? Leave me alone ! For God 's sake , Ma . Are you okay ? They dropped the charges . I have to fill out a form . No big deal . No big deal ? I 'm running for Congress . Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to me if it gets out , with our family 's past ? What could you possibly need so bad that you had to steal it ? Never mind , I don 't wanna know . Socks . Socks ? Dad left you a fortune . What are you thinking ? You know , it 's been one ridiculous stunt after another with you for the Iast six months ! Dad 's gone , just get over it ! You know what ? Leave her alone ! She 's okay , that 's all that matters . I gotta keep this out of the press . You know what ? Just get out of here . Go worry about your image , I 'II handle this . Yeah . Good . I gotta make sure this stays buried . Thanks a Iot , Mom . Mmm-hmm . What were you thinking ? I just wanted to feel alive again . Nathan only cares about himself . Your father was the same way . alpha dogs , both of them . You , in the meantime , for all your selflessness , and sitting with dying people ... What ? You 're gonna retire on what you make ? Maybe I 'II shoplift my socks . Don 't get smart . When you put everyone else first , you end up last . You always put Nathan first , he took advantage . Yeah , it wasn 't you that was just pushing him right out in front of me ? He takes up more space than you . Demanded more attention . And besides , it 's not my fault , you allowed it . He 's my brother . I Iove him . Ah , love is overrated . He loves me , too . I know him . We 've always been close . Rose-colored glasses . That 's cruel , Mom ! Look , since Dad died , I know you 've been feeling free to speak your mind , but it wouldn 't hurt to edit yourself every once in a while . I 'm sorry if the truth hurts . I 'm just saying you hero-worshipped him . And those feelings were never returned . You 're wrong ! It 's biological , and I can 't help it , we 're connected . I never told you this , but when Nathan had his accident , I knew it . We all got the same call . No , I 'm saying before the call , like he was telling me , 300 miles away . I woke up , and I knew that he 'd been hurt . I hate it here . She doesn 't even have any books to read . Baby , I 'II be right back , I 'm just gonna go and pack up a few things . We should really go see Dad . What good would that do ? He could help . He should know that someone 's trying to hurt us . Your dad 's not in any position to help us right now . Look , I made some mistakes , I admit it . Mom , what 'd you do ? Hey . I need you to know that I would never let anything happen to you . Promise . Mom , why 'd you look at yourself like that in the fish tank ? ( SIGHS ) How long ? Just a couple hours , tops . There 's some ice cream in the fridge . Go ahead . What happened ? I went to see Linderman . How much ? Thirty . You gambling again ? No , it 's just bills . And I used the rest to get Micah into private school . They didn 't know what to do with him at public , and I just ... I needed them to think that we had money . From the mob ? Hell , Niki . You weren 't born yesterday ! I 'm just two weeks overdue ! I mean , I thought that I could handle it , okay ? I 'm under a Iot of stress right now , okay ? Gee , I wonder why ? I feel like I 'm kind of losing it a Iittle bit . I 'm seeing things . Like ? Like I keep feeling like someone 's watching me . Yeah , Linderman wants his money back , so he sends some mouth-breather that 's gonna put you in the hospital . No , it is someone else . It 's someone that I can 't see . Does this make any sense to you ? No . I 'm sorry , you know what ? But I 'II tell you what does ... I shouldn 't be telling you this . No , no , Iet me tell you what does make sense . You need to come up with that 30 grand plus interest , now . Or you gotta run . Watch him . AII right . Cool , huh ? How hot do you think it is in there ? Turn on the camera . Scotty ! Scotty ! Come on ! Take it easy , you 're all right ! I 'm okay , I 'm fine ! Take it easy . There 's no burns ! Get going ! One , two , three , four , five , go ! One , two , three ... MAN : Yeah , I was real sorry to hear about your father . He seemed like a good guy . Man , I thought I was a slob . They were here , too . What ? Nothing . I got a guy who can clean this up for 100 bucks . No . It 's all right . I 'II take it as it is . We rent by the week . I 'm gonna need to know you can afford it . I have a job . Doing what ? Driving a taxi . I 'II get you an application . MAN ON RADIO : In these uncertain times ... We need a leader who ... Nathan Petrelli . He served his country in Bosnia . SIMONE : Hey ! Oh , God . What ? The silent treatment ? Oh , boy . Isaac ? What are you doing ? What the hell is wrong with you ? Isaac ! Okay , stop ! What ... What , are you crazy ? clearly . I don 't even remember painting these . I was high , okay ? I lied to you . Damn it . I 've been chasing for a month . Well , then , get yourself back into a program and make it stick this time . These are fantastic ! No ! They 're evil . What are you talking about ? What am I talking about ? You know what I 'm talking about ? You see this ? Suicide bombing in Israel . I painted it three weeks ago . Yeah , so ? So ? That 's this morning 's paper . Look at the number on the bus . This happened yesterday . Yesterday . Something 's wrong with me . We 'II get you help , Isaac . I tried that , twice . There 's only one way left . And you know it . You can 't go cold turkey , not alone ! I mean , Iet me help you , please ! No ! I Iove you ! I 'II drag you down with me , I swear to God , I will . Just leave me alone . Get out of here ! Now ! REPORTER : An unidentified Good Samaritan who witnesses describe as a young teenage girl ran into the flames and rescued the young lieutenant . Now the train is registered to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , and there has been no official statement yet as to what was in the car . But judging by the amount of security around here ... TOM : ( ON SPEAKER PHONE ) It wasn 't easy , Nathan , but consider it gone . I know I owe you big on this one , Tom . I 'm not gonna forget it . Yeah , I won 't let you forget it . Thanks . Sure thing . Mom 's rap sheet is now officially buried . It only took half my political capital to pull it off . Why can 't she get herself a hobby like a normal person ? They were married 41 years . It 's a plea for attention . She 's lonely . Give her some time , will you ? I don 't have time . I got eight days to make up ten points . I need all the help I can get , which is what I wanna talk to you about . I wanna offer you a job . A job ? Yeah . I trust you . You 're good with people . I need a coordinator to help organize the volunteers , and you got nice guy instincts , I could use that . I 'm a shark , Pete , everybody knows it . And it 's starting to show up in the polls . I bring you on , and it kind of reflects well on me , you know what I mean ? Yeah , all right , so I make you look good . That 's a new one . It makes me look like I put family first . I mean , I know that sounds self-serving , but this is for you , too , right ? You 've got to think of your future . How do you do that ? Do what ? Even try to make it look like it has something to do with me ? You didn 't hear anything that I said earlier today , did you ? About how you can fly ? Yeah , I did . I 'm gonna pretend for both our sakes you didn 't say anything like that . I 'm trying to do the right thing here . Look , I already have a job . Yeah , watching old people die , now there 's a career . It 's not cute anymore , man . The dreamy kid , sitting in the back of the classroom , staring out the window ? It 's time for you to grow up . Look , I cast a big shadow , Pete , I get it . Life isn 't fair . But there 's nothing I can do about that . I 'm trying to do the right thing by you here , okay ? I don 't want your pity . Hey . Corner of Center and Canal , please . Wow . Solar eclipse . Yeah , yeah , I wonder if it 's gonna be total . Not here , no . Some other part of the world , yes . A global event . Makes one appreciate just how small our planet really is . And we 're all quite small really , aren 't we ? What 's your name ? Mohinder . I 'm Peter . Let me ask you something , Mohinder . Do you ever get the feeling like you were meant to do something extraordinary ? I 'm driving a cab , you may have noticed . No , I 'm not talking about what you do , I 'm talking about who you are . I 'm talking about being special . Yes , we are all special . That 's not what I meant . Some individuals , it is true , are more special . This is natural selection . It begins as a single individual born or hatched like every other member of their species , anonymous , seemingly ordinary , except they 're not . They carry inside them the genetic code that will take their species to the next evolutionary rung . It 's destiny . Hey ! Hey , I can 't believe you just left like that ! Yeah , I know , I was there . You saved that dude 's life , he was okay ! Welcome home . Get over there . Fifty grand is a Iot of money . Fifty ? It was 30 . Even with interest ... Mr. Linderman wants to be nice about this . You should have read the fine print . Look , I have a son . I 'm all he 's got . Mmm . please , I can get you the money . I 'II tell you what I 'm gonna do . I 'm gonna make you a Iittle business proposition . You make , what , 40 bucks for every 20 minutes you take off you clothes ? Well , I 'm gonna give you a chance to lower your debt a Iittle . And see where it goes from there . Come on . Come on , show me what you got . Lift up your shirt , baby . Oh , look at that belly . Smile for me . That what you want ? Ah , yes . What 's the matter , baby ? You just started getting good here . What 's the problem , baby ? I said , what 's the matter ? Screw you . Screw me ? ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( SINGING I WANT IT THAT WAY ) ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) ( ON ANSWERING MACHINE ) Hi , this is Niki . Leave me a message . ( BEEPS ) MICAH : Mom , are you there ? When are you coming to get me ? I hate it here . You said you 'd be back soon . Just come pick me up , okay ? ( SHUSHING ) ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Hello ? SIMONE : Peter , it 's me . Hey ! Simone ? Are you busy ? No , I was just heading home . Listen , I need you to meet me at my dad 's . Yeah , no , I can be there in 10 minutes . Just hurry , okay ? Yeah , okay , okay , I 'II see you there . Bye . You know , I 'II hop out here , please . Thanks . Where to , my friend ? JFK , please . I 'm going home to my family . These business trips are wearing me out . Suresh , huh ? I 'm sorry ? Your name . On your license , there . That 's Indian , yes ? There was a Professor Suresh at the University of Madras , a geneticist . Interesting theories . Don 't think he 's teaching anymore . But you wouldn 't know anything about that , would you ? Probably lots of Sureshes where you 're from . Like Smith or Anderson . And then Carla had the nerve to tell me he 's not breed-worthy . Like he didn 't win five all-breed rallies , two regionals . Can you believe it ? It 's just not true , Mr. Muggles . It 's not true . He 's a Iittle stud muffin , that 's what he is . He still humps my leg when I watch TV . AII right , enough about Mr. Muggles . What 'd everybody else do today ? Doug and I saw this Mexican guy . A homeless dude , on our way to school . We thought he was dead , but he wasn 't . I thought Dad was coming home today . Well , ah , I was gonna surprise you . He finished up early , he 's coming home tonight . Isn 't that great ? Just in time to read my report card . So what about you , claire , do anything special today ? I walked through fire and I didn 't get burned . What the hell is that supposed to mean ? God , you 're so crazy sometimes . Lyle . I think I know exactly what you mean . Oh , here I am , talking dogs again . And you go and say something really profound . We come up against all kinds of fires in our lives , and when we test ourselves and face our fears , we usually don 't get burned . You are very wise , sweetheart . Whatever it is you did , I 'm proud of you . And so is Mr. Muggles ! He 's just so proud of claire ! Aren 't we ? We 're proud of claire . Yes , we 're so proud of claire , aren 't we ? She 's the best . Hiro . What are you looking for ? Morphine . What for ? I need you to come with me someplace . Where ? You 'II see . Look , there 's ... There 's something I need to tell you . Now that is gonna have to wait . No , look , I need to tell you about this , okay ? I 've gotta stop living for other people . My whole life I 've had no idea what I 'm supposed to do , what I 'm supposed to be , if I even have a destiny of my own ! I promise you we will talk about this later , okay ? But right now I really need you to come with me . You 're a nurse , you can give out a shot , you can help him . Help who ? I thought we could go to the movies this Saturday , maybe try on some shoes at the new mall in Gardendale . Sure . I Iove you , Mom . But ? No buts . I just wanted to tell you that . I know you think I 'm trying to be your best friend again , admit it . No . It 's all right , we can go to the movies together . It 's no big deal . I just miss you , that 's all . I wanna be your mom , I wanna give you advice . But I don 't wanna push you away . I want advice , I do . I won 't push you away , I promise . I just don 't think you should be so worried about fitting in all the time . About being so popular . I don 't want to see you make mistakes like I did . I wanted to be someone more interesting than I am . You are interesting . You breed show dogs . Whose mom does that ? No , I wanted to hitchhike across Europe . Study art . Fall in love with some poetry-quoting Frenchman . Not that your dad isn 't wonderful , but my point is , you should know who you are and know that it 's enough . 'Cause who you are is special . About that . There 's something I need to say . Something I never talked about 'cause I thought it would upset you and Dad . Sweetheart , you can say anything to us , you know that . I think I 'm old enough for you to tell me who my real parents are . Of course you are . Honey ! I 'm home ! Your father . Hey , honey ! Bad , Mr. Muggles ! No ! I 'm glad you 're home . Oh , me , too . I have such a headache . I slammed my head getting out of a taxicab . Hi , Daddy ! Hey , baby ! ( EXCLAIMING ) Hello , New York ! PETER : I 'm just saying it 's impossible . Nobody can predict the future . I saw it with my own eyes , Peter . Isaac ! I brought someone here to help . He 's a nurse . Isaac . Isaac ? Isaac ? Isaac ! Simone ! Oh , God ! Okay . Oh , my God . Isaac ? He 's alive . Call 91 1 . What have you done ? God , he 's overdosed . Yeah , I 'm at 215 Reed Street , number seven . I need an ambulance here immediately . He 's OD 'd . No , no , he 's conscious . Just barely . I know . Listen , could you just come ? Get here soon , please . Okay , baby , it 's okay , they 're sending an ambulance right now , okay ? You just hang in there , okay ? You 're gonna be okay , I swear . We have to stop it . ( CRYING ) Oh , baby . We have to stop it . MOHINDER : This quest , this need to solve life 's mysteries . In the end , what does it matter when the human heart can only find meaning in the smallest of moments ? They 're here among us . In the shadows , in the light . Everywhere . Do they even know yet ? AII right , I 'm here . Now what do you want ? Peter ? I 've been up here all night thinking about this . Thinking about my destiny . What are you doing , Pete ? It 's my turn to be somebody now , Nathan ! Come on , Peter , quit screwing around ! Peter ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) You 're flying , Nathan . You 're flying . How did you ... I don 't know . No ! No !

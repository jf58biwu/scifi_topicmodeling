 LAURA : Previously on Surface . KADEE : Oh , my God ! ( screaming ) AP 's reporting that the lake collapsed into a sinkhole . This footage was shot last night inside the sinkhole in Texas . The Navy robot was outfitted to withstand heat up to 800 degrees . How far did it get ? Forty-three , forty-four miles . ClRKO : This allows them to survive such a hostile environment . My brother is trying to talk to me . TRACY : Dr. Davey thinks you might have post-traumatic stress syndrome or ... MAN : Rich ! I can see by your interest that you 've had an encounter . So , how long were you a prisoner ? What ? A prisoner in the Aquatic City . Planning on telling me that you lost your job ? Girls , in the car , right now . Hey , baby .

My pet , Nimrod , he can be kinda jumpy . That 's okay . We don 't have to take him for a walk or anything . ( SQUEALlNG ) ( screaming ) Kutchy ! ( ALL screaming ) Three paragraphs of your thesis were lifted verbatim . That 's absurd . Plagiarism . Until it 's resolved , there 's not much I can do . LEE : I have some experience with whistle-blowers . So you ruined her career ? Come on , this is serious . They framed me , Carolyn . The government doesn 't want people to know about it and they don 't fight fair . So why should you ? ( LOW growling ) ( gasping ) Oh ! LAURA : Do you know what this means ? We can track its feeding patterns , dive time range , lung capacity . ( PEOPLE chattering ) ( COMPUTERS BEEPlNG ) ( BEEPlNG ) Excuse me , sir . You need to see this . So this could get you your old job back ? No . It could get me a better one . Just because you know where a whale is ? No , I told you . It 's not a whale . Oh , right , it 's an unclassified marine vertebrate . That 's right . One that 's moving at over 100 knots . Over 115 miles an hour . That 's faster than anything in the water . And you discovered it ? Well , yeah . I mean , I was the first to see it and record it . Until they screwed you out of everything . Whoa , hey , we don 't use language like that . Except when it 's accurate . LEE : Do you know what this is ? This is a GPS signal picked up off NSA Carnivore . Someone 's tagged a live one . Who ? It 's a mystery , like the crew of the Topeka . A hundred and eleven men gone without a trace . BUG : You can 't leave . You got responsibilities . Poker night , duck season ... I 'm honoring my responsibilities by doing this . Tracy and the kids are here , man . Hey , it 's all right . I ain 't going forever . What about my porch ? Come on , man . We 'll finish the dang porch when I get back . Figure out what it is I 'm supposed to do . Like you figured out your decor in the living room ? ( sighing ) Look , I 'm going to talk to the only person I know that saw the same thing I did . Man , I gotta find somebody , anybody else who 's going through what I am . I 'm dying here . Does she know you 're coming ? Not exactly . No . Look after her , all right ? Yeah . phil : He shocked me and knocked me on my butt . He 's a menace , man . No , he 's not . He just ate Amber Lu 's dog , dude . That 's bad . " lf found , please call . " We don 't need to call . People are gonna find out . Like your parents . Yeah . Hey , maybe I 'll come clean . You know , maybe they 'll just let me keep him . Don 't be a sucker . There 's only one way to go in a situation like this . What ? Full and total denial . ( CELL PHONE ringing ) ( BOAT HORN blowing ) Hello ? Hey . Hey , it 's Rich . Oh , my God , Rich . Hi .

They 're huge . Where are you ? Oh , I 'm actually in California . I had some business out here . A little conference . How far are you from Sausalito ? Uh , a couple hours . ( clearing THROAT ) We 're so dead . Amber is , like , mortified . Really ? Duh . I 'm sure she 's telling her mom that your thing ate her dog . ( SHUSHlNG ) Do you honestly think no one is gonna find out ? Find out what ? Honey , are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . ( PHONE ringing ) Don 't say anything . sylvia : Hi , Cathy . Amber 's mom . You 're such a goner . sylvia : Oh , of course I 'm listening . It just sounds so ... Oh , Cathy , I 've never allowed Miles to have a pet , let alone ... Well , if something happened next door , shouldn 't you be calling them ? Okay , then . I 'll talk to him . That was Amber 's mother . Is she on some kind of medication ? No , she 's fine . Why ? Well , Amber 's dog 's missing and I guess they 're very upset . Hey , there ! Boy , it sure beats the last boat we were on , huh ? Hey , nice to see you . Come on . Hi there . ( laughing ) Mmm-hmm . Golly , I thought I 'd gone overboard . ( sighing ) And that 's only some of it . Here you go . Oh , thank you . Sure . LAURA : You see this ? I 've got a friend at the Weather Tracking Service and she took satellite photos of my tagging trip . Oh , wow . Yeah . This is a whole pod of them . Yeah . Maybe even a school . Look at that . Huh . Now , that is amazing . But I saved the best for last . Check it out . Listen . ( BEEPlNG ) That 's him ? Yeah . Yeah , he 's at 34 North , 117 West , heading down to the north end of Baja . See ? Yeah . You can see the history of his route , track his movement over time , right here . Look at that . Well , they 're out there . He 's out there . Hi . Got a present for you . I don 't take the SAT for two more years . Never too early to start . It 's how your sister got a 1450 . I could study for 50 years and I wouldn 't make a 1450 . Now , what kind of attitude is that to have , hmm ? The truth ? ( DOORBELL ringing ) Read . Oh , no . Oh , no . Hey , Phil , it 's me . sylvia : Miles ! Yeah , just a second ! phil : Yeah , what do you want ? You gotta move Nim . Now . It 's like I told the girl 's mother , we don 't have any pets . Well , a lot of parents think that , ma 'am , then find out different . Believe me , I know what my children are up to . I 'm a very involved parent . Miles ! Well , these exotic dealers , they don 't need a note from your parents , not as long as you got the cash . Yeah ? Mr. Furella is here from Animal Control . Howdy . Did you find Amber 's dog ? I sure am glad I came out here . Yeah , me , too . It 's nice to have someone to talk to . Hmm . My neighbors think I 'm crazy . Listen , there 's something I 've been meaning to talk to you about . And I apologize if I get too personal on you here . ( sighing ) Well , I 've been having some issues since the accident and , well , I was wondering if you 'd had anything , like a daydream or a ... Like a flashback , you know ? Oh , man , it 's like a strong daydream . Like a light at the end of the tunnel type of deal . No , man , I 'm sorry . I haven 't . Well , that 's okay . ( COMPUTER beeping ) That 's weird . Huh ? What 's weird ? It 's never come that close to land before . This could be our chance to get it on tape . Do you understand what this means ? If I can get a videotape of the animal in the wild , goodbye plagiarism , hello tenure . All right . Well , how far to the Russian River ? Like , three hours . Make it two . ( gasping ) Jesse , come on ! We don 't have time for this , baby . Come on ! I 'm sorry , peanut . Here we go . Okay . We 're gonna go see Daddy . It 's gonna be great . Good boy , Jesse . Hey , buddy ! There we go . Hey . We were just checking to see ... Yeah , that 's a good boy . Put on your seatbelt . ( BUZZlNG ) This Amber told me it looked like a reptile with a head fin . Could be a Cayman or a land iguana . Killers . Gut a sheep right through . It shocked Amber 's dog . To death . Then ate it . It was horrible . It was like an electrocution . I hope I 'm not insane when I 'm your age . You 'll be in jail when you 're my age . Okay , I don 't know what 's going on here , but if it keeps up , I 'm gonna call your father . ( WATER splashing ) ( screaming ) All right , get back . I 'll get it . SAVANNAH : Ew ! Oh , my God ! Stay calm , stay calm . ( screaming ) sylvia : Savannah ! Savannah , move ! FURELLA : Oh , I didn 't do that . Oh , Mom ! Oh ! SAVANNAH : Miles ! sylvia : What am I gonna tell Cathy ? Look at this mess ! I can 't believe it . Look what you did ! FURELLA : I didn 't poke it that hard , ma 'am . That pool is just old . It 's just old . ( NlM growling ) Come on , dude . Come on , Nim . Be a good boy , please ? I wanna know what happened to Amber 's dog and I wanna know now . I told you , I don 't know . Savannah ? No , Mom . He 's lying . He does know . He 's been hiding that lizard thing in Phil 's backyard . What ? Yeah , Mom , a lizard that executed Amber 's dog with a ball of lightning . I don 't appreciate the sarcasm , Miles . Look , me ? What about her ? Well , Savannah doesn 't have some pet I don 't know about . I don 't know what happened to her dog , okay ? Maybe it woke up , got a load of Amber , and ran off . When you 're ready to tell me the truth , young man , you come talk to me . And don 't be late for school . How does everything around here get to be my fault ? Chill , homey . It 's all cool . No , Phil , it 's not cool . ( CAR engine starting ) It was cool . What ? Well , see , I thought I 'd put Nim inside your mom 's car ... You didn 't ! Come on , we gotta go . LAURA : Rich , you can 't pass here . Oh . ( HORN HONKlNG ) ( tires screeching ) You know the speed limit 's like 55 around here . Don 't worry . If I get a ticket , it won 't track back home . They ain 't on the whole computer , national computer thing yet . Not really what I was referring to . Misunderstood what that look was for . Yeah . Ah , don 't worry , this is as fast as she goes . That 's a double yellow . Not a problem , I got this . Now , what ... How long you been tracking this thing ? Since last Saturday . It 's never done anything like this , right ? It 's never gone up in a river . No , I told you . It 's never come within 20 miles of land . Oh , come on . This guy won 't get outta my way . Hey ! Whoa , Rich , come on . This is not the road . That 's what this baby 's for , off-roading . ( tires screeching ) Look , man , I wanna see this thing , too . I just don 't wanna get killed doing it . I 'll be careful , all right ? You 've got my word . You 're not out here on business , are you ? No . ( NlM rustling ) ( CAR LOCK BEEPlNG ) Excuse me . Excuse me , can I get some help over here , please ? MAN : Right away , ma 'am . See her car ? Nope , nothing . She better be here , man . Relax , we 're gonna get your critter back . Nimrod . His name is Nimrod . Okay , dude , chill . Don 't tell me to chill ! I 'm not on the honor roll , I can 't throw a football . Nim is my extracurricular , all right ? Sure , man . Whatever you say . I just hope it don 't do to your mom what it did to Amber 's dog . LEE : Yes , sir , we 're working on it . We 'll have the name of the person who 's tracking the animal shortly . Yes , sir . ( PEOPLE chattering ) I understand . Can you hang on a moment , sir ? Give me a realistic time frame . This isn 't simple , you know . They have to vet the satellite trilateralation feed and check that against ... A time , in simple , non-technical language . It takes what it takes . We 'll have a name soon , sir . ( CAR LOCK BEEPlNG ) Okay , just this . And that goes with it , too . Yeah . All right , let 's go . The manager is here today , isn 't he ? ( CAR LOCK BEEPlNG ) ( SQUAWKlNG ) ( phil whistling TO NlM ) phil : Dude , this is gonna be bad . Excuse me . Your aquarium exploded in my living room . I 'm sorry , we don 't sell aquariums . Well , you did last week . A special . The line starts right there . WOMAN : ( ON P.A. SYSTEM ) We need a check authorization on five . Check authorization on five . MAN : ( ON P.A. SYSTEM ) No waiting at check stand four . No waiting register four . Are we just cutting school ? This is an emergency , Phil . We gotta think what Nim 's gonna do . What 's a wild animal do in a grocery store ? Nim 's not wild . He ate that lap dog in one bite . Are you looking ? Yeah , dude , I 'm looking . But seriously , you give me the heebs . WOMAN : What 's all the commotion about ? phil : What are they doing to it , man ? MAN 1 : Will you look at that . WOMAN 1 : Let me in , let me in . I don 't know . MAN 2 : Okay . WOMAN 2 : Ooh . WOMAN 3 : Oh , yeah . WOMAN 1 : That 's all right . ( ALL chattering ) I guess I 'll try it . ( CHATTERlNG ) ( register BELLS ringing ) rich : How 's the signal ? How are we doing ? LAURA : Still moving upriver , 10 miles past the headwaters . ( CELL PHONE ringing ) Hello ? Rich . Bug is telling me you 're going to California . rich : Honey , you won 't believe it . I 'm on the hunt ! I 'm tracking one right now . Okay , it 's right here . It 's gonna be coming up , okay ? Oh , okay . Yeah . Okay , did I just hear a woman 's voice ? Yeah , it 's Laura . Who is Laura ? Laura Daughtery , the biologist , South Carolina , remember ? She tagged one . TRACY : You son of a bitch . Turn , turn , turn , turn , turn , turn ! Look at what the data 's migration projections are showing . They 're not projections anymore . We identified the tagger . Laura Daughtery . They are not going to do anything . It 's a difficult situation . Oh , yes . They won 't allow free radicals to run around out there . Look , she could get a tape , then it 's out . On the news , on the web . Viral . And once it 's out , you can 't get it back . So , she should be killed and dumped into the river ? Of course not . But information must be controlled . No threats . Listen , Davis , if anything happens to Dr. Daughtery , I will quit . MAN : ( ON P.A. SYSTEM ) Attention , Piggly Wiggly customers .

It should be visible in , like , a minute or two . rich : All right . LAURA : All right . Let 's go . ( rich laughing ) I knew there was a reason for me to come out here . Thirty-five seconds . Oh , man . See , I 'm not like you . I never had , like , biology or , you know , any interests , or I never had a passion at all , really . Well , maybe fishing . It should be coming right around the bend . You know , nobody really ever wakes up wanting to be an insurance salesman . These last few weeks , I tell you , I really felt like this is all happening for a reason . ( panting ) And that I got a really big part to play . You ever get that feeling ? Yeah , I do . Ten seconds . Yeah . You getting it ? Yeah , I 'm getting it . ( whistling ) Hey , boy ! I mean , if that 's not evidence , I don 't know what is . Yeah . Thanks for getting here so quickly .

Coast Guard , Humboldt Bay . We have visual . Excuse me , sir . I 'm sorry . Look . I 'm looking at it . No , the cameras . MAN : ( ON LOUDSPEAKER ) Ladies and gentlemen , we will not harm this animal . We 're going to attempt to convince this animal to head back out to sea . I repeat , we will not harm this animal . ( BOAT HORN blaring ) ( CROWD cheering ) ( CROWD whistling ) It 's still here . What ? It 's still here . Listen . ( LOW growling ) ( MAN chattering ON radio ) ( HlGH-PlTCHED PULSE ) ( CROWD EXCLAlMlNG ) Well , young man , you 've really outdone yourself . SAVANNAH : You really have . RON : Shall we review the last couple of weeks ? sylvia : Brought home by the Coast Guard at 4 : 00 in the morning . Lying to us about a pet lizard ... SAVANNAH : Which ate Amber 's dog . Oh . What am I gonna say to Amber 's mother next time I see her ? Two weeks , and you 've been in more trouble than Savannah has in her entire life . Anything you wanna say for yourself , partner ? ( PHONE ringing ) I 'll get it . Hello . Hey , baby ! It 's Daddy . rich : What 's going on ? I miss you , Daddy . Oh , I miss you , too , baby . Hey , is Mom around ? Mom , Dad wants to talk to you . I don 't think she wants to talk to you right now . emily : She wants to know why you 're in California , Dad . All right , well , it 's okay . It 's okay if she doesn 't . Just tell her Daddy loves her , okay , baby ? Okay . And I love you , too , all right ? Bye . Bye . ( PEOPLE chattering ) ( SlRENS wailing ) Hey . Hey . Hey , listen , I sure am sorry if I scared you earlier today . You know ? I can get a little riled up sometimes . Face facts . I mean , hey ... You can 't call this a coincidence , when I drive all the way from California ... Can I be honest with you ? Yeah ? You did scare me a little bit earlier . I mean , we don 't know each other that well , you know ? And the only thing we really have in common is this . And if we 're gonna keep going , I have to be able to trust you . Absolutely , and I ... Hey , you can trust me , okay ? I promise , I swear . You can trust me . Excuse me ? Yes ? Are you Dr. Laura Daughtery ? Yeah . Would you mind coming with me for a moment ? Who 's asking ? Yeah , just hang on a second . Nobody 's going anywhere . What 's the problem ? This is not a request , ma 'am . Hey , hey . I 'm talking to you , not her . Please , this is not your concern . I understand that , sir . Hey ! Get your hands off me . Hey ! Hey , hey , hey , hey ! That 's an officer . What you trying to do , man ? You know what , there 's something going on here and these people got a right to know about it ! They know what 's going on too , y 'all . They know and they don 't want you to know ! ( CROWD shouting ) Come with me . Thirty eyewitnesses all describe a large mammal , a whale some say ... Are you done watching ? My head is killing me . And here 's where the story gets stranger . It seems to have hit a submerged power cable . Never a thing on TV . Feeling any better ? How I 'm feeling isn 't the problem . He 's trying , Sylvia . Trying ? Trying to get brought home by Animal Control ? That 's not trying . Trying is standing in line at the grocery store with a broken aquarium like an idiot . Suddenly realizing that your son has been lying to you about having a pet lizard ... RON : Now , wait a second . Maybe he 's been lying to us because we 've been a little too hard on him . Hard ? The kid has every toy known to man , a 100 volume video game collection ... Oh , and have you seen his grades lately ? So he 's not an academic like his sister . Well , that 's an understatement . He 's gonna have to improve . I don 't know how he 'll ever get into college . Nice work . Got the parents fighting . Where 's the lizard ? Oh , right . Top secret . He ran away . Happy ? Oh , my God . You miss that thing . It 's a reptile , moron . It has a brain half the size of a pea . You 're , like , bonding with a vegetable . You really can 't take it personally . Well , you have the right to remain silent . Oh , I know it . But it don 't ... What does it matter ? Big old cover-up going on here , I know it . Everybody knows it . I 'm gonna prove these things exist . I 'll tell you that . My little brother didn 't die for nothing . Sure , buddy . Get in the car . ( sighing ) Freak . A little late this time , Dr. Cirko . A lot of people saw it . How you gonna spin that one ? We won 't have to . Yeah , you will . A lot of people had cameras out there . The creature pulsed , and all digital data within two kilometers was destroyed . Don 't try to scare me with your crap , man . I have some experience with this problem . ( sighing ) I 'm sorry . But listen , I want to discuss something . You can 't stop me . I 'm not here to stop you . There are government interests . They 're trying to keep control of what is happening here . They have decided to have you involved . But it is not why I want you . I want you involved because you 're a good scientist and I respect you . Which you demonstrated to me by framing me for plagiarism . I pointed out that you had managed to do something with almost no resources . That we failed to do with tens of millions and the United States military . You tagged the creature . Why should I work for you after what you 've done to me ? Because you will be present for history . ( tapping AT window ) ( NlM growling SOFTLY )

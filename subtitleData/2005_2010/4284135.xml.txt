You have my husband in a box ! Don 't let them hear you call it a box , the tech boys . Total self-contained life-support system . It 's the safest place in the world , apparently . As long as the batteries don 't run out . Let her go , it 's fine . What 's that ? What 's that noise ? He 's having a sort of ... Well , a sort of panic attack . Get him downstairs , let 's get him stabilised . OK . To me guys , come on . Be careful , though . Slowly . Uh , Claire , this way . Mrs Jackman .

I 'll be with you shortly and there 'll be somebody on the door if you want anything . I warned you about the coffee , didn 't I ? Remember you said " rich " on the day you took my family , on the day you took my children and put my husband in a box . Remember you said " rich " . I apologise for the coffee . Hello ? - A handful , isn 't she ? - Who 's this ? And attractive too , I 'm sure you 've noticed , but you have an eye for the ladies , don 't you , Mr Syme ? Pot , kettle . Although I 'm not sure I 'd trust you with the wife of a friend . - Pot , kettle . - Who is this ? Who 's speaking ? Miranda Callendar , private investigator . Mrs Jackman paid me to follow her husband , your organisation paid me to stop . - Peter , could I have a word with you ? - Sorry , just ... Sorry , just one second . And you are Peter Syme , lifelong friend of Tom Jackman and his principal betrayer and abductor of his wife . Abductor ? What on earth are you talking about ? I 've watched her being driven into your offices . I 'd say it was a pretty full-on abduction . Although maybe you just lock women up in your basement , recreationally . - Pot , kettle . - Min ! I haven 't the slightest idea what you 're talking about . There 's some woman called Miranda Callendar , check her out . Claims to be a private detective . - Says we paid her off . - On it . - Peter ... - What is it ? - Excuse me ... - Meg ... - Peter . - Take my coat . Thank you . What is it ? - Can we go outside ? - Why ? Mr Syme , she says that she wants to speak to my boyfriend . - Yes ? - She 's very attractive too . I am impressed . What is your secret ? Money or conversation ? Is there a point to this ? I 'm outside , I 'd like you to let me in . And why would I do that ? Because you 're a bad boy and I 'm a good detective . - Hello ? - Oh , you are a busy boy , aren 't you ? - I hope you 're taking vitamins . - What are you doing ? - Open up . - Are you serious ? - Hello ? - You can phone everyone I 've ever slept with in the entire building , you are not coming in here ! Go home , this doesn 't work . I know , but this will . I want to speak to Winston Churchill . Oh , and I don 't mean that dreadful MP , I mean the real one , the war leader . I want to speak to the real actual Winston Churchill . I 'm such a fan . Winston Churchill ? If you 're lucky , I 'll introduce you . It 's the best holiday ever . Your kids are having a good time too , since you ask Kids ? We have kids ? So that sea air 's working its magic , then ? Mm , nightly . Sometimes afternoonly , couple of times morningly .

We just want to go back to our hotel ... - He 's not your husband . - Yes . Yes , he is . I am her husband and we 'd like to go now , so if you could ... I 'll prove it . OK . Watch this . Are you watching me now ? Now , would your husband let me do this ? Well , come on . Would your husband let me do that ? Please . Just leave him . But you can see what I 'm saying . Would he let me do that ? What do you think ? - Yes , he would . - Oh , OK . So how about this ? Would he let me do this ? Please , stop . No . Tom ? Just ... Just let him . - It 'll be OK . - Yeah , just let me . There . Tom ! It 'll be over in a minute . Finishing touches . Very nice . Help yourself to the other one . You 're her husband . Let 's go .

I 'll flirt with the maître d' - Kind of late , isn 't it ? - What for ? - Ice-cream van . - There isn 't any ice-cream van . Tom , there were too many of them . I know . And anyway ... I don 't want the kind of man that gets involved in that kind of fight . - Don 't you ? - Of course I don 't . OK . I 'm off to flirt with the maître d' Lighten up or I 'm going all the way . - Is someone coming ? - What ? Why have you brought three ? You asked for three . Do you want me to take it away ? - Yes . - No problem . Right , I 'll go and see what I can do about a table . Don 't wait up . Oh , sorry . Um ... I was just , er ... Sorry . No problem , sir . Could you sign for the drinks ? Yes . Thank you , sir . Have a good evening . # A heart of stone , a smoking gun # I can give you life ... - Where you off to ? - Slash . Tom ? Tom ? I told you . I think he went out the window . Why would he go out the window ? Where would he go ? It 's funny , just don 't know why I want to hurt you . Don 't even know your name . Don 't know my name . Please ... Just woke up wanting to hurt you . Please , don 't . I was born to hurt you . Please ... And do you know what ? It just never gets old . What do you say , lover ? Ready to go again ? - Please . Please , don 't ... - Just let me . No , please ... Now , now , it 'll be over in a minute . Finishing touches . # I wanted to bite not destroy # To feel her underneath # Turning into the light # Cos I 'm on fire - # Cos I 'm on fire ... - Oi , look at this . Oh , please ! Oh , God ! What ? - She 'll be here any second . - Oh , jolly good . Do sit down . Thank you . Just to remind us why we 're all here . I hope your hand 's as strong as you think it is . No , you don 't . Ah , Claire . Mrs Jackman . Mrs Jackman . Miranda Callendar , I think you know , the detective you employed . She 's been a little unforthcoming on what she found . Do I get a refund ? And this is , er ... Min , her assistant . - Actually I 'm a detective too . - No , she isn 't . - I 'm on the cusp . - You 're not . - It 's a grey area . - Min ! And this is Katherine Reimer , of course , I 'm sure Tom 's mentioned her . I 've heard a lot about you . I 've heard bloody nothing about you , dear . I work for your husband . Do you dress like that or do you wear clothes ? - I wear clothes . - Does he notice ? Half the time . Everyone here is aware of your husband 's ... interesting condition . Great ! You all knew . Fantastic ! No one think it was worth telling me I married a werewolf ? You didn 't marry a werewolf , Mrs Jackman , you married Dr Jekyll . Dr Jekyll ? Dr Henry Jekyll died in Edinburgh in 1886 . - Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde ? - Yes . Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was a story . - No , it wasn 't . - No , it isn 't . OK ... Sorry . Just , um ... just trying to catch up here , just trying to be clear . - I married Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde ? - Yes , you did . Come on , seriously ? I 'm Mrs Jekyll and Hyde ? Yes , you are . That 's so like a man , isn 't it ? There 's always something they 're not telling you . - " Sorry , should have said , I 'm Dracula ! " - This is not a joke . - This is not serious ! - Henry Jekyll died without issue . - He 's the last of the Jekyll line . - Sorry ? - That means no children . - I know what it means ! Tom can 't be Jekyll 's descendent , because Henry Jekyll had no descendants . - But that doesn 't make any sense . - No , none whatsoever . Um , what has Tom told you about his parents ? He was fostered . His mother abandoned him . On a railway platform in Belfast in 1967 , six months after he was born . I don 't believe that . - You don 't think he was abandoned ? - I don 't think he was born . Yes ? Excuse me . But please , I don 't want to miss anything . - Ready ? - As soon as you say . - Is she there ? - Yeah . - How 's she been ? - Well , in fairness , she 's jet-lagged . I shudder to contemplate . Might as well get started . I 'm just going to say this again , you know that there 's no guarantee . I know , good luck . Thank you . OK everyone , it 's a go . We 're going to have to clear the room . Miss Utterson , we 're clearing the room now . Of course . Where are you ? I went to the hospital . I don 't know , I feel , I feel ... You 've been gone a whole night ! Where have you been ? I don 't know . I woke up on the beach . Claire , it 's weird , I feel ... I feel ... You feel what ? Fantastic . I feel fantastic . - What have you been doing ? - I don 't know , I just , I feel ... - I don 't need my glasses . - What ? I don 't need them , I don 't know where they are . I can see perfectly . 20 / 20 vision , it 's like being a kid again . I can see ! - Do you ... do you have your wallet ? - My wallet ? ! Have you had a bang on the head ? You 're not making any sense . How could that fix my eyesight ? I don 't know ! Something bad 's happened to you , and it hasn 't fixed your eyesight . Just ... just check your wallet . For God 's sake , I 'm telling you , I can see . Tom , where 's the hospital ? I 'm coming over . Tom ? Where 's the hospital ? Tom ? Come on , come on . Shit . Shit . Shit . - No , get down . - Everything OK ? - Are you all right in there ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Go ! Jesus ! Who are you ? What are you ? OK , this way . Sorry about the lights . Here you are , watch your step . I mean you 've got to think fixer-upper . But there 's a lot of potential here , there 's a lot of ... rooms . OK . I can read a face , me . There 's a couple of rentals in Hammersmith , they 'd probably be more up your street . I mean this place ... I know I shouldn 't say it , but quite honestly , I wouldn 't lock up my worst enemy in this place . I would . Dr Henry Jekyll died in Edinburgh in 1886 . Six months after his death , his research notes , plus whatever survived from his various experiments , passed into the ownership of a newly-formed company , Klein Utterson . Klein Utterson still survive to this day . And how do you find them as an employer , Mr Syme ? - American . - Ooh , and initially Scottish . A frightening combination . Klein Utterson also took possession of something else , the body of Dr Henry Jekyll . - How am I doing ? - Fascinating fairy tale . There 's a copy of this fairy tale with my lawyer . I hope that 's enough to secure my safety for the evening ? Oh , absolutely . You should definitely hope that . In the 70 years following Henry Jekyll 's death , and in total secrecy , there were , I think , 16 attempts to recreate his experiment , resulting in sixteen deaths . And then in 1965 Winston Churchill died . In the papers a few months later , a silly season story about our old friends Klein Utterson and how they were going to bring good old Winston back . How ? Cloning . A clone . Created from the DNA harvested from his body . A brand new grow-your-own Winston . How is that going , by the way ? Is he done ? You were going to make a clone of Winston Churchill ? Of course not . Just some bloody idiot mouthing off in a pub . Trying to impress a girl from Hull , according to the records . Unfortunately , her father worked for one of our more esteemed tabloids . You weren 't trying to clone Winston Churchill , you were trying to clone Henry Jekyll . After all those years of failing to recreate his experiment , you finally decided to throw in the towel and recreate the man himself . How am I doing now ? It took until 1997 to successfully clone a sheep . Do you really imagine in 1965 we were able to clone a dead Victorian ? Klein Utterson were successfully cloning farm animals in the 1950s . Anyone that tried to speak about it ended up very rich or disappeared . - Which are you hoping for ? - Neither . You think Tom Jackman is a clone ? A genetic experiment , grown in a lab ? Yes . I see . Tell Colonel Hart we 'll be needing him . This is over . - Why ? - Because Tom Jackman is not a clone . You have nothing . You have walked in here with nothing . I 'm sorry . - Why are you sorry , Peter ? - Mr Syme ? So soon ? Vital signs ? - All normal . - What have you done to Tom ? I told you we had a cure , what do you think we 've done ? - You 're going to cure him ? - No , we 've already cured him . - We should take Mrs Jackman with us . - Why ? - Because she 's entitled . - What about them ? - They 'll have to stay here . - Why ? No , it 's OK , you go , see your husband . We 'll see you again shortly . Yeah . Yeah , see you . Bloody shame , actually . You should have been working for me . - You said I had nothing . - Oh , nothing at all , really , but you were so close . But ... if ... if Henry Jekyll had no descendants , if Tom Jackman isn 't a clone , then where did he come from ? I was hoping you were going to tell us , because we don 't have the faintest idea . Daddy ? Is that you , Daddy ? Are you my daddy ? Did you want to know what I look like , Daddy ? You did , didn 't you ? What do you think ? Are you proud ? What do you look like , Daddy ? Are you old ? Are you really , really old ? You feel old . I can feel you in here . Feel your thoughts . Old , dusty thoughts . Old and scared . Always so scared . Why are you so scared , Daddy ? Are you scared of me ? Are you married ? Do I have a mummy ? Or are you alone ? You feel alone . You think alone . I can feel what you think . Think of a number . No , do it Daddy , think of a number . A big silly number , go on , it 's a game . Say it out loud , a big fat number , any big fat number . - 103 . - 103 . Oh , God ! I was right , wasn 't I ? Bet I was . Waaah ! I 'm in your head . I know what you think . I am what you think . Scared now , aren 't you , Daddy ? Scaredy Daddy . I 'm not scared of you ! Yes , you are . I 'm coming to get you , Daddy . I 'm coming to eat you , Daddy . Oh , you 've got a vivid imagination , Daddy . I 've been there . You , shut up . Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Just a moment . - Who is it ? - Delivery , sir . - I didn 't order anything . - 6 Stadler Street ? Dr Jackman ? You phoned yesterday , said it was an emergency . New television , sir . Do you want some help opening the box ? Why is he in that box ? It 's the only way to keep him stable . They 'll be ready for us in a moment , uh ... Coffee ? - Could someone get some coffee ? - Why now ? You 've had a cure for over 50 years , you said . Because your husband ... Claire ... Tom 's dying . Every change is shredding his DNA . He won 't see 45 . He may not even see the end of the month . We couldn 't wait any longer . - We wanted to . - Why ? - He 's all yours in a minute . - Thank you . - Why did you want to wait ? - We know how to stabilise him and we 've always known how to stop the changes , but we didn 't know in which form he 'd stabilise . - It 's Hyde we want . - I don 't want Hyde . I know . - Watch out , it 's hot . - Go away . It 's all right . Who is he now ? How do you know which one he 's ... stabilised as ? We open the box . And then what ? Either you take Dr Jackman home , or Mr Hyde stays here . - They 're both my husband . - No , no , no , Hyde is ours . I see . Well , then . I 'll have that coffee , thanks . I 'd wish you luck , but you wouldn 't believe me . It 's not an even chance , is it ? You wouldn 't be doing this if it was . You think it 's Hyde in there . - They do . - You don 't ? At every stage of this , Tom 's been stronger than anyone ever expected . - I 'd never bet against him . - You sound like you 're proud of him . - He 's my friend . - Yes . He 's your friend . - How hot ? - Very hot . - Thanks . - Arrgh ! Jesus Christ ! - I apologise for the coffee . - Well , then , what are you waiting for ? - Get my husband out of that bloody box ! - Shit !

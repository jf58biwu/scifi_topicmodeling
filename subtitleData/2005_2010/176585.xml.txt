 It 's happened ! Singh , I was looking at a sea orchid , and it hit me . Come , it was ... it was triple bond . One I 'd never seen before . Adenine , Glycine , Kerotine . Over and over again . Agk , agk , agk . With no detectable mathematical pattern . On the first chromosome , 15th sector , 29th quadrant . It wasn 't until I looked at a sea orchid ... that I realized . I haven 't had my coffee today . I 've found it . What ? The origin of the species . I know where it comes from . Ron . Ron , did you hear something ? Nim , no . What are you doing ? You stay where I put you . Okay ? You know what would happen if Mom found you down here . Salt . Like the ocean . You like that , huh ? Ranky . Everything so far ... only the beginning . We have to set you up in Washington immediately . With Dahl ? Yeah , with everyone . Pentagon , DOD , White House . Let me make a call . Get you on a plane to DC . [ speaking Croatian ] Okay . There 's a Tramway transport from Edwards . A DOD plane will meet you at the tarmac in 30 minutes . You are not going ? This is out of my league . Good luck . I don 't understand why you 're not coming home in the meantime . Because they made me sign an affidavit that says I won 't leave the state until my court date , baby . So you are not gonna see the kids for a month ? I don 't like it any more than you do , babe . Then we have to pay $ 2,500 to a bail bondsman ? Do you think Mr. Conway 's okay ? I think so . Hello ? I wasn 't gonna ask you for that money . You can 't enable him . Rich , you know we 're only getting a paycheck for three more weeks . Of course I know that , baby . Come on . Look , you 're gonna have to have some faith here , all right ? Is Daddy in jail ? I do have faith . Real faith , but ... Well how about having some real faith in me ? You know , I 'm doing what I think is right here . Hon , don 't twist this around on me when you are the one in California with some other woman . All right , well , we can 't talk about this right now . I love you . Bye . Can 't tell that woman nothin ' . She just--there comes a time you gotta trust someone . Oh , okay . Thank you very much . Thank you , sir . Everything okay ? Who was it ? Marin County sheriff . Well , thank you for coming down . Like I told you , this is an older gentleman , hit and run . No witnesses or- - No . And no skid marks before the impact . Why 'd you call me ? Well , the paramedics found your business card near the body . It 's the only lead we got . Now prepare yourselves . The victim has multiple blunt force injuries . There is significant bruising and abrasions . Yes.ou know him , ma 'am ? Um ... His name is ... His name is Alexander Cirko . [ mumbling ] Alexander ... C-I-R-K-O ? You mind if I ask you a few questions , ma 'am ? Not at all . I 'll tell you one thing ... that wasn 't no car accident . You saw him two days ago , y 'all swapped war stories , then , bam , hit and run . Come on , that doesn 't sound a little weird to you ? Cirko just told me he was bringing me into the investigation . Exactly , that 's what I 'm talking about . You 're almost in , and he gets in an accident ? Come on now . Let 's try to get out this way . Miles ! Miles , get out of bed ! It 's 1 : 00 in the afternoon . Okay , okay . Jeez , Nim . What did you do ? Oh , my gosh , Nim , I told you , not in the house . He 's gonna sleep the whole day away . Hmm . Nim , stop . No play . Nim , no play . S-stop that , boy ! Let go ! Miles ! Stay . Well , I was beginning to think you 'd gotten bitten by a tsetse fly . Um , I didn 't sleep so good . Ugh . I don 't blame you . It smells horrible in there . Why don 't you clean out the pigsty ? Yeah , okay . I mean it . I want it clean , Miles . No , I 'll do it . Well , I 'm actually walking out of the house right now . Yeah , so can I call you later ? Yeah . Oh , that . Well , holding your children accocountable . That 's all it takes , really . Yeah . Miles ? Yeah , Miles is coming around . Okay , I 'll talk to you around 2 : 00 ? Come on , where are you , Alex ? This is Alexander Cirko . Please leave me a message . Cirko 's office is to the left . ( whispering ) Come on ! Come on ! Where is he ? He 's gotta be around here somewhere . Look over there . Spread out and look for him . ( whispering ) Come on ! Come on ! We have an intrusion in corridor F. I see him ! Halt ! Hey , you ! Stop ! Don 't let him get away ! ( second man ) Yes , sir ! I 'll head him off . Hey , get him ! Hit the lights . There he is--Stop ! Stop ! Where 'd he go ? Hey ! Hey ! Stop ! He 's there ! Don 't let him get to the elevator ! Hey , get him ! Get the door ! Get the door ! Somebody open this door ! Read to me about Cirko . " He is a maverick among biologists , " whose critical refinement of Darwin 's Origin of Species polarized the scientific community . " Well , he more than just polarized it . I mean , he was stripped of his chair at Berkeley for his theory of spontaneous equilibrium . " And cast him as a defiant outsider " for the latter stages of what was once a bright academic future . " Well , the guy had enemies . Definitely was not an accident . Can you give me some salt ? Yeah , where is it ? Um , on the counter . Jesse ! Jesse ! It 's time for dinner ! Jesse ! Jesse ! Jesse ! Jesse ! Jesse ! Never do that to me again ! You hear me ? Do what ? What did that man say to you ? What did he want ? He wanted to know where to fish around here . Have you found Dr. Singh ? We haven 't been able to locate him as yet . But you 've takene ofcovered resea Yes , sir . Packed up and shipped to DC , as you requested . We 're organizing a team debriefing for lower personnel . There is one issue , however . What is it ? Videotape from the lab showed that Singh might have gotten away with a specimen . Some kind of marine flora . Find Singh . Recover the specimen . It 's of the utmost importance . I understand , sir . Oh , my God . Phil . Phil ! Don 't let my mom see us together . From now on , our friendship 's gotta be covert . Why ? They think you 're a bad influence . So--so that 's how it is ? A little adversity and you just throw me under the bus ? I 'm grounded , man . I 've never been grounded before , ever . Not for anything . Well , if it 's any consolation , Nim 's back . Big whoop . That thing never liked me anyway . Is that my dad 's car ? What 's he doing home ? Mom ? Is Dad home ? Yeah . Why do you suppose that is , Miles , huh ? Is it here ? Huh ? Uh , what ? The thing . Is it here ? I--I--I don 't know what you 're talking about . Miles , I can 't listen to this anymore . I 've had it . Your dad and I both have . Mom ... If you just gave him a chance . What did you say ? If you only met him- - I did meet him , Miles . He was in my kitchen cabinet . But this isn 't about your lizard . It 's about your lying . I 'm very disappointed in you , son . I 'm up to my ass in depositions on a Saturday . The last thing I need is your mother calling me up , hysterical , in the middle of a workday ! I know , Dad , I 'm sorry . Sorry isn 't gonna cut it anymore . I 'm tired of sorry . I wouldn 't do that , Dad . Son of a bitch . The teeth on that thing . He wouldn 't hurt anyone . It 's in the floor , isn 't it ? Isn 't it ? ! The damn thing 's in the floor ! Miles , out of the way . Out of the way ! Promise you won 't hurt him . He 's already killed a poodle , Miles . What do you want it to kill next , a baby ? Your sister ? Don 't answer that . It 's in the walls now . He 'll come to me . I trained him . You can 't train a lizard , Miles ! He 's just scared . Shh , shh , shh . I trained him to do a lot of things . He fetches , and he can do these jumps out of the pool . This is all a big joke to you , isn 't it ? You 're 14 , Miles . You 're too big for pet lizards . Time to start acting like an adult . I--I 'm trying . Like you were trying to tell the truth ? Honesty 's all we got , buddy . That 's it . Without it ... we 're strangers . Just go to your room . Please don 't hurt him . Just go , Miles . Now . Well , come on , you think you can take the champ ? Let 's have it ! You think you got what it takes to take the--oh ! ( female reporter ) The Bolinas waterfront was packed today with people trying to catch a glimpse of what locals here are calling American Nessie . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ! Look , look , look . It 's us . Hang on , buddy . With us now , an eyewitness . Now tell us , what did you see ? ( woman ) Um ... this huge thing . I don 't know what it was . Uh , it had orange eyes . Oh , come on . Really smooth skin , like a salamander . Are you seeing this ? It 's not the first time ... Salamander . I know . ( woman ) The river road at the mouth of the bay . Also on a day of the new moon . These creatures are connected to the zodiac . Oh , poor , poor woman . ( reporter ) Whatever it was , it was selling a lot of T-shirts . For now , News 3 , Michelle Adel- - Hey . Hey , man . Hey , you all right ? Huh ? Come on , now , buddy . Wake up . ( Laura ) Oh , my God . Do you know him ? Yes , it 's Krishna Singh . He is an evolutionary biologist . He 's Cirko 's right-hand guy . I 'm not getting a pulse . This ain 't good . Oh , my God . I feel sick , Rich . I really do . I can 't- - ( man ) Hey , hey ! Everything all right out here ? Hey , there 's been a bad accident . Could you please call us an ambulance ? Sure , right away . Try to open from the inside , that door . Where ? So just reach in with your hand . There 's a little handle in there . He ... he ... wanted you to have this . Just take it easy , man . Just take it easy . We could just throw it into the ocean . We could . Forget that we even ... got it . Walk away ? You know , call the police . Let the authorities deal with it . Yep . The authorities . Like Cirko ? Singh ? You know ... Whoever hit Cirko and killed Singh , they want what 's in this locker . If we go sniffing around ... we 're fair game . Not only us , I mean , our families too . Yep . Walk away . I can 't . This ain 't ... just about my brother anymore . There 's something more . I can 't explain it . But I couldn 't go back to hocking insurance policies if I tried . I understand if you want to do something different . Have you taken a look at the house upstairs ? Yes , I have . ( Ron ) Yeah , know what that 's gonna cost to replace ? ( Sylvia ) I know , and , uh , I don 't know . The trust . I don 't know- - You know , where do you start with that again ? ( Ron ) I don 't know where we start with this kid . But he 's out of control . I can tell you that right now . ( Sylvia ) Well , that 's why we need- - I think we need ... Word to wise ass . You might wanna stay in your room . What are they doing ? Uh , wondering how they ended up with such a defective son ? Just so you know ... boys and their creepy animals ... You 're supposed to have outgrown that by now . Did Dad find him ? That 's what you 're worried about ? That thing ? Did he ? You 're hitting puberty and going completely insane . Mom and Dad are only trying to help you . Finally realizing that your son has been lying to you about having a pet lizard- - ( Ron ) Maybe he 's been lying to us because he didn 't ... You 've heard the horror stories of affluent kids with a sense of entitlement , right ? Yes . I just don 't want that to happen to Miles , Ron . Well , we 've already given him too much . Way too much . First it 's lying . Then he 's sneaking out . Getting drunk with his buddies . Then he 's dealing pot . Yeah , well , I didn 't have half the advantages that he 's had . Half . Well , and look what he 's done with them . I-I-I just think we should at least explore other options . That 's all . Like what ? Well , something outward bound . Maybe military schools . Something that 'll teach him character . Discipline . I don 't even know where he was going with this whole thing . I don 't know what 's wrong with him . I don 't get it . But we 've got a decision to make . Are we gonna be parents or are we gonna be friends ? Well , where do you draw the line ? He 's 14 years old . Line 's already drawn . Already drawn , don 't you think ? Okay ... . we definitely need to find you a new crib . 'Cause , well ... we have just been voted off the island . Which , you know , in a way , I understand . What did you do ? You ... you ate some salt . and a poodle . Which , you know , I guess is wrong . But ... I swear to God , Nim ... I--I really don 't see how we 're the big problem here . Don 't worry ... I 'm gonna stash you someplace safe . Hi , Cheryl . Hi . Sorry to intrude . It 's okay . Shawn , hey . How you doing , buddy ? How you doing ? Fine . Hey , how you doing ? Rich Conway . Oh , sorry . This is Rich . My friend who I- - Shawn . Shawn , pleasure . I told you about him . He 's the one who saw , the--the- - The new vertebrate . The new vertebrate , right . So I heard about your job . What happened ? Something about plagiarism , or- - It was an allegation ... Shawn . She was framed . It 's really ... Things are really complicated right now . And I think it would be a good idea if- - if Jesse ... stayed here . There 's a body outside our house . A body . You wanna tell me what 's going on , Laura ? ( Rich ) Look ... Laura believes the government 's covering up the existence of a new species . And is killing people to do it . Well , it 's not that extreme . I mean- - Oh , come on . Well , it is that extreme . I mean- - The situation is really extreme . And I think the same thing too . For what it 's worth . Shawn , I know how this looks , and I know how it sounds . But I wouldn 't do it if I didn 't have a reason . Hey , Jesse , why don 't you come on in and I 'll put you to bed ? Yeah , okay . That 's a good idea . Right ? Hey ... you know how much I love you , don 't you ? Infinity ? Infinity plus one . Promise me you 'll find it . Okay . Tomorrow we do this . Let 's go . Not bad , right ? Me and Phil come here sometimes . It 's a good hangout . You know ... Mom and Dad aren 't usually like this . They--they just gotta get used to you . That 's all . That 's all . I gotta go ... Yes , sir , that 's right . He 's been gone about five or six hours . Yes . I understand . But he 's never run away from home before . Yes , sir . Okay , thank you . Don 't worry . He 's a smart kid . He 'll be okay . Here , here , here . Ah ! Ah , trees and ... lots of cover ! This is a good place for sniping ! Can you shut up and help me with this thing , please ? Here , here , here . That 's it . That 's it . Stop ! Stop ! It 's stuck , it 's stuck . All right , all right . Oh , gosh . Well , I 'm not really good with small spaces . I 'm a girl . Oh , come on ! You 're a girl that drives submarines and tags little sea- - All right ! Move over . Get your butt in there . If I don 't come out in 10 minutes , call the police . Yeah , yeah . Shoot , if you 're not back in 10 minutes , I 'm calling in an air strike ! All right . Just stay calm . Rich , there 's something in here you 're not gonna believe ! You gotta see this , Rich ! Rich , you gotta see this . You 're never gonna believe what 's in here . Hey ! Hey , hey ! Get down here , come on ! What are you doing ? I need you to pull me in . There 's somebody coming ! Yeah , but you won 't fit ! I can 't even- - I mean- - Come on and get me ! There 's somebody coming ! I gotta get in there ! Careful . I--I--I gotta go . Nim , look , I 'll be back , okay ? It 's just that ... I don 't know , I got school . And--and my parents ... I don 't really wanna think about my parents . Look , I- - I need you to stay . Stay . Oh , man . They must have been watching us the whole time . Don 't you think we should come clean ? I think we should come clean . No , th-these are not people that are- - are gonna list you know ? We don 't even know what kind of people these are . I 'll tell you what we need is ... You don 't even- - We need a weapon . I 'm sure we should just go out there , and just , you know , pretend like we 're totally meant to be here . We 've got keys , I mean- - Look , I 'll tell you what . You talk , I 'm gonna hit . And we 'll see who gets out of here . What the hell am I supposed to do with this ? Use your imagination . Hey , the car is gone . It 's gone ? Well , just a little bit paranoid , I guess , huh ? No , you 're not . That 's what they do . Th technique to get you out into the open . What are you talking about , " technique " ? How do you know what their technique is ? Because I 'm an oceanographer , and I spend a lot of time on boats reading spy novels . Just a second ago , you were talking about reason- - Remember that I got framed , and that Cirko is in ICU , and that Singh is dead . Just because you 're paranoid doesn 't mean they aren 't after you . ( man ) Look , this door is open . Let 's see what 's going on over here . Better go in and check it out . The door 's jammed . You ready ? Let 's do it on my count . One ... Two ... Three ... You folks having any trouble ? You 're supposed to check in at the guard station . Oh , yeah , sorry about that . Almost called the police , but I figured I 'd come ... have a look-see . Well , we 'll make sure to do that next time . Sorry about that . Promise , okay ? k yo Feel like an idiot ? No , no more than usual . Huh , funny-lookin ' thing , ain 't it ? It 's the research . Hmm ? What ? What research ? Mine . He used my research to track the migration patterns . Don 't worry , Mr. and Mrs. Barnett . The boat is gone . We know he 's on the water . I 'll find it . Be careful with him , please . There he is . There he is now ! Miles ! Miles ! ( Sylvia ) Miles !

If you turn around , we 're gonna be fine . ( Sylvia ) It 's okay , just come back ! ( Ron ) Miles , we 're not in a lot of trouble right now . If you just stop and turn around , we 're gonna be fine . We 're gonna be fine ! ( Sylvia ) Miles ! Come back ! It 's okay ! Just come back ! Miles , listen to us ! Just listen . Just listen , buddy ! Okay , I 'm gonna go . It 's not gonna be safe much longer . Get in . Nim , get in . Come on , Nim . [ door squeaks ] Crap , dude , you scared the bejeebs out of me . Good , maybe you 'll start acting normal . Your parents are wigging . How did you find me , anyways ? Did you see where I hid the boat ? How many times have we come here , idiot ? It wasn 't that difficult . Well , where did you put your bike ? Right next to the " Find Miles Here " sign I posted up on the road . Dude , are you okay ? They 're gonna take him . They 're gonna take him . [ sighs ] We--we gotta put him somewhere . We just--we gotta leave . Have you got any money ? Um , my little sister just had a birthday . She sitting on maybe $ 100 . Okay , I- - I need it here . I had almost $ 300 stashed up in my bookcase , if Nim didn 't shred it . Son , you probably think you 're in so much trouble right now . Things can 't get any worse . That 's not accurate . Now step away from that thing . You can 't take him . Is he dead ? ! We gotta call 911 . Okay , take him . Take him ! No , no . Um , that 's terrible . I 'm s--yeah . Thank you . Yes , thank you for calling . What 's up ? Cirko passed away . The police are calling it a homicide . No , no . No , what are we doing ? This is my house . I 'm not leaving .

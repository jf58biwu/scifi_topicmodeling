I mean , it must be drawing eletriity from somewhere To electrocute people the way it did . - yeah , okay , i 'll just add that To our already-huge list of questions . Thank you . all right , good-bye . - what ? why are you making that face ? - what ? what are you- - you got something ? - eletroution- - That 's the word rebeca used , But we didn 't know it did that yet . We hadn 't figured it out . - oh . - mm-hmm . - i see more ookies in my future . - of ourse you do . - i don 't know what you 're talking about . - you asked if there were any more electrocutions . What exactly did you mean by that ? - i heard it on the new . - no , it was never mentioned in the news . - ma 'am , you know more than you 're aying . - okay , let 's cut to the hase , shall we ? You didn 't ome in from d.c. The unexplained eletroutions raied a flag . You found jack , And you finally figured out there was an artifact . You 're from south dakota , right ? Thi artifact that jack was hunting for Before he disappeared- - It 's active again . Am i orrect ? - you weren 't just hi girlfriend . - you 're a warehouse agent . - welome to the onveration . - okay , come here . I mean ... - ew . - thi is it . - oh , that 's a definitely a nasty lobster-looking thing . - and what is- - That 's electrocution , right ? - yeah . - yeah . - wait , what was that writing ? Thi one . - okay , see , this- - This writing ... I very ... Old . I have no idea what that writing i . - well , you want me to , uh , you know , scan it in , Do my thing ? - [ coffs ] you go , girl . - don 't . - sorry . - that 's wrong . - yeah . - uh , you left before i could be certain you were warehouse . I wanted to share thi with you- - What i dug up back then , what i think jack was following . There 'd been several unexplained deaths , Burned bodies . It tarted at a museum Shortly after an 11h-century exhibit passed through . I couldn 't find a connetion , But jack had vibe about thee things- - Very annoying . He must 've tarted to invetigate , and then ... Then he just disappeared . I always knew if we didn 't quit , One of us , one day , would lose the other . But for jack , The warehouse was his first love . Till death do them part . I scoured the crime scenes , But i never found any answers . - you never went back to the warehouse ? - i couldn 't do that . Changed my last name , just disappeared . I stayed in st. louis , hoping to find him one day- - Maybe lost , confused . Eventually my life was here . - myka . Does this look familiar to you ? - that 's what we aw on--on lark 's back . That 's--that 's the devie . - that 's jack 's handwriting . - jack knew what he was looking for . [ farnworth buzzing ] - are you still using that old thing ? - [ chuckles ] Yeah , right ? - okay , can you see thi ? Thi is what you 're looking for . It 's alled " the pine of the saracen . " - oh , okay , great . uh , so it has a name ? What is a saracen ? - a saracen 's a turk . Now , liten , there 's a legend that during the firt crusade , The turks had thi elite warrior ult , And thee warrior were rumored to be unstoppable For some reason in the field of battle . What i 'm thinking i that the spine- - Can you see thi ? The spine was speifially deigned As a weapon for these warriors . - 11th entury--it 's the ame as the museum exhibit . - what exhibit ? - well , we found pitures too . Uh , something happened at a museum exhibit That jack secord stumbled on . Rebeca showed us thi . - so maybe this thing was sealed and it got out omehow . - okay , so if we find it , How can we top it ? - yeah , okay , well , i 'm deciphering the text right now . It 's a little diffiult , but i 'm trying . It 's the words under thi drawing , And looely translated , it ays , " the pine requires a lifetime ommitment . " - oh , yeah , man , i had a girlfriend like that once . - [ chuckles ] - [ laughs ] - so--so this thing must get its power from omewhere , right ? So if we shut down it oure , can we stop it ? - yeah , well , you know , when i figure it out , you know what ? You 'll be the second to know . - so this--this spine- - You know , it 's probably still at lark 's apartment . - so we should get there before omebody else finds it . - now , jack was a very good agent , the best . You be areful . - yeah , we will . - okay , so the last time we saw lark alive , He ran into this alley , so we should tart here ? - well , unless you want to look under the arch . - [ laughs ] - aah ! help ! - what is that ? - help me ! Help me ! - hey ! - hey , hey , hold it ! hold it ! hold it ! - he 's trying to kill me ! - bring the gun here . - i shot him . i shot him in the chest , And he just kept oming at me . - who are you talking about ? - [ grunting loudly ] - oh , god . - okay , now would be a good time to take the shot . - [ grunting ] - [ grunts , breathing heavily ] Okay , that didn 't work . pete ! - no , but the good news i , we 've pissed him off . - okay , stop it ! we 're on your side ! - [ grunting loudly ] please help me . [ breathing heavily ] Please help me . - god . [ grunts , breathing heavily ] Oh , god . - vince . What happened ? i he- he 's gone . [ breathing heavily ] - he was my ex-husband . There was a restraining order , but i 've never een him- wait . it 's gone . - but how ? - [ shriek ] - ma 'am , get out of the area now . Now ! - pete ! Do you ee it ? [ breathing heavily ] - no . Do you ? - no . [ breathing heavily ] - look out ! [ creaming ] - pete ! pete ! Pete ! pete , what 's going- [ continues screaming ] Pete , don 't move ! - i 'm okay . - okay , just let me call artie . - [ grunting loudly ] - all right , just let me- no , stay away ! I don 't want to hurt yo- - [ screaming ] - agent bering . Agent bering . Agent bering . Are you okay ? - where 's pete ? - i don 't know , he 's not here . what happened ? - the same thing that happened to lark And jack , It 's happening to pete . I--i have to go find him . - hang on one second . you were knocked out . We need to all an ambulance . - i 'm fine , okay ? Just--just exuse me . i have to go . - the spine was designed for one thing . It turns a person into a killing machine . It 's a warrior-maker . It uses the body like a big battery , Heightening and redirecting The host 's natural eletrial impulses . - yeah , it 's like ancient pcp . It jacks up your adrenaline and testoterone . So on a scale of 1 to 1 , you 're about a 25 . - until the battery i drained and the barbs retract . It lies dormant just waiting For the next nearest living hot To latch onto . - artie , the spine is on pete . - okay , where is he right now ? - i don 't know . Just tell me that you an remove it . - we will , we will . There 's a way . there 's always a way , myka . - artie , liten to me , i can 't , um- - I will not loe another partner . Just the look in pete 's eye . Artie , he looked- - I 've never een him so angry . - that 's not pete . that 's the artifact . It just- - it feeds on aggresion . - it makes you go after what you hate , right ? Clark went after the gangs , And the last vitim went after his ex-wife . - a warrior that 's been programmed To kill his enemies . - jack fought it . He fought his feelings long enough So that he ould seal himself up And not hurt anyone . - what are you aying , myka ? You think pete is gonna do exactly the same thing ? - i don 't know . Artie , what do i do when i find him ? - what have you got ? Claudia , just tell me anything you 've got . - okay , hold up , so when thi thing was built , Eletriity didn 't exist yet , right ? So it 'd zap people , But what would happen if it got zapped ? I mean , that 's what the bolt of lightning was In the piture that they found . Remember , jack wrote- - Both : hand of god . - maybe that 's what shuts down the spine , A bolt of lightning . Overwhelming the spine 's receptors Might make it automatically detach . - that 's not bad . Just turn the tesla 's power to full . - no , artie , look , we already tried that . - all right , liten , myka , Find pete . Your tesla 's not strong enough , So you 'll have to find a powerful electrical source Somehow , omewhere . - he 's gonna take a bullet . - what ? - that 's what we 're trained to do , isn 't it ? Every secret ervice agent will take the bullet For the preident , for his country . That 's what jack did . He acrificed himself . That 's what pete 's going to do now . - no , because pete- - Pete know that the spine will just lath on To another person . - then he 's going to make sure . That 's what jack did . - agent bering , Your partner lattimer , two of my men Just aw him headed back to the tation house . - what- - why would he- - The generator . - he 's found his bolt of lightning . - lattimer . lattimer ! Stop . - get out ! - powell , wait ! Wait . Look , it hannels anger . Okay , you have to go outside . please , just go . - [ breathing heavily ] - pete , it 's gonna be okay . Okay , artie can fix thi . - the spine require a lifetime ommitment . You can 't help me . - yes , i an , okay ? You just- - you just have to- no ! I can feel it . Thi thing is stronger than i am . I don 't think i can fight it much longer . - yes , you an . yes , you an . Okay , we an find a solution . We an lok you up until we find an answer . - like jack ? Buried for all those year To have that thing come back to life ? No ! It 's gotta end here . I have to die . And i have to take the spine with me . You undertand , right ? - pete . - take these ... And clamp them to the spine . I tried , but i- - I can 't reach . If i mis , i 'll just kill myself And it will attach to its next victim . Myka , you 've got to do thi . - pete , i can 't . - please ! Please . [ cream ] [ groans ] - pete , listen to me . Pete ! You will ome back . Do you hear me ? You will . - do it . - [ creaming ] Oh , god ! - oh , god . Come on . Damn it . Come on , pete . [ panting ] Don 't leave . Come on , pete . Come on !

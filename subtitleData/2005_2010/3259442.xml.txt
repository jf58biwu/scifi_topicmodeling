What Can You Tell Us About Your Son 's Relationship With Chloe ? They Went Out For A While . I Don 't Think . 000 Diamond Bracelet ? I Don 'u Know . That 's A Lot Of Money . My Fault . And Then They Don 't Know What To Do With It . But He Is Not A Killer . Manufactured In Italy Until The 1940s . This Is What Was Found Under The Victim 's Fingernails . Banned For Its Toxic Lead Content . But What 's Revealing Is The Medium Used . The Artist Added Water-Washed Linseed Oil Laced With Gold Leaf . Gold Leaf ? It Was A Marker . An Artist 's Unique Signature . Can You Date It ? I Would Say 1930s . Then She Probably Wasn 't Killed At Eddie 's . No Madagascar Red There . Maybe By Eddie . Or Someone Who Wanted To Frame Him . That Painting Could Be Anywhere . It 's Gonna Be A Very Cold Trail . Not If You Know The Painter . My Mother Seldom Worked On Canvass . She Was More Known For Her Onsite Murals . She Painted Them All Over New York- - Libraries . They Called Her One Of The First Graffiti Artists . The Paint Really Does Shimmer . She Mixed It With Gold . Did She Keep Any Records ? Not A Bookkeeper . But You Could Try Asking Her . I Thought Your Mother Passed Away . She 's Still Here . That Is . The Alzheimer 's Plays Havoc . Julianne . Hmm ? I Wanted To Ask You About Your Work . You 've Seen It . Many Times . You Used A Pigment Called Madagascar Red . Did I ? Such A Lovely Color . What About Madagascar Red ? It 's-It 's So Long Ago . It Might Have Been For A Special Commission . Julianne . It 's Important . Yes . For The Lover 's Sacrifice . You Know . I Know . Julianne ? They Won 't Let Me Take Walks Anymore . They ... They 're Worried I 'll Forget My Way Home . Sometimes It 's Better To Forget . Don 't You ? Do I Know You ? Not Anymore . She Painted The Mural In The Presidential Suite Of The Davenshire Hotel . The Eavenshire ? Sold In The Eighties To Hardwick Hotels . But Motive ? We Need Evidence . We Have To Get Into That Suite . I 'll Get A Warrant . Charlie ? You Think I Wouldn 't Remember You ? You Think I Wouldn 't Remember What We Had ? I 'm So Sorry . This Happens Sometimes . It 's Ok . Let Her Be . One Day You Left . You Just Left . I Gave Up So Much For You . Didn 't I Mean Anything ? I Knew You Were Going To Leave Me . I Knew It The First Day We Met . Ever Ask Yourself Why A Vampire Has No Reflection In A Mirror ? Not This Week . It 'd Be Too Painful . Unchanged While Everything Around Him Grows Old . To Search For Love But Know It 's Always Just Out Of Your Reach . Because To Be Human Is To Die . To Die Is What Makes Life Worth Living . It 's God 's Joke . What About The Girl In The Subway ? There Were Probably A Couple Hundred Women On That Platform . Maybe Not . Maybe She Was On Her Way To The Airport And Is Long Gone . It 's All Maybes . Maybe It 's A Sign That I 'll Never Find Her . Your Desk Is Done . Newly Painted . The Killer 's Standing Here . She Falls Against The Wall Here . Shouldn 't We Wait For Crime Scene ? Absolutely . And It 's A Mess . Hmm . This Must Be A Lab Error . These Numbers Don 't Make Sense . The Hemoglobin Level 's Over The Moon . 120 Micros Of Lead ? That 's Enough To Kill Someone . And Check Out The Blood Type . It 's This Rare Form Of Rzrz . It Became Extinct When Certain Native American Tribes Disappeared . Somebody 's Pulling Our Chain ? Hope So . But How Did Toby Remove The Body ? There Must Be Security Cameras Everywhere . You Know ... This Guy Kind Of Looks Like You . You Think ? What The Hell ? It Was Common For Turn Of The Century Hotels To Build Secret Entrances To Their Best Suite . Toby Could Have Known About This . Took A Chance . That 's Years Of Bad Luck . Only 7 . Let 's Bring Him In . No ! Ok . There 's No Way I Reserved That Room . Toby ! I Wasn 't There . There 's No Way That You Can Prove That I Was . That 's Enough . Counselor . Mr. Hardwick Is My Client . You Do So . Otherwise He 's Leaving With Me . I Don 't Need Someone To Talk For Me . Toby . There 's No Way I Could Have Killed Chloe . She 's My Friend . You Were Jealous Because She Met Someone Else . But Not Like That . Then How ? You Don 't Strike Me As The Platonic Type . Isn 't He ? Is He-Is He Watching ? Toby . What If I Could Prove That I Wasn 't At The Hotel That Night ? You Don 't Need To Say Anything . I 'm In Love With Someone Else . I Was With That Person The Night That Chloe Was Killed . Yeah ? We Need Her Name . I Can 't Do That . You Can If It 's True . Ok . His Name Is Brian Shaw . I Guess We All Have Secrets . That 's What Keeps Us In Business . What Do You Think His Father 's Saying To Him ? He 's Telling Him He Loves Him . A Romantic . I Can Read Lips . I Suppose . It Was Temporary . Normandy . A Shell Exploded Too Close To Comfort . Sorry I Asked . Talked To Toby Hardwick 's Boyfriend And Verified His Alibi . Eddie Riley 's Our Guy . Hotshot . Even Red Ruffing Lost A Few . I Just Heard From Mcmanus . He Found Eddie At The Penmar . Turns Out His Brother-In-Law Runs The Place . He 's Been Hiding Out There . Santori 's On His Way To Pick Him Up . Get In . What Happened ? Tried To Run . It 'd Work Again . It Didn 't . He 'll Be All Right . Found This On Him - A.38. Tony . Brought This One Home . I 've Been Doing This A Long Time . But Sometimes Uhings Are What They Seem . Thanks . That 's A Good Lesson . You Didn 't Buy A Word Of That . Not True . He Said I Have Good Instincts . What Do Your Instincts Tell You Now ? Same As Before . Eddie Didn 't Kill That Girl . Why Did He Run ? Why Didn 't He Give Himself Up ? Finds Chloe 's Body . Gets Blood All Over Him . The Cops Show Up . He Knows What It 'll Look Like . Body 's In His Place . Who 's Gonna Believe Him ? So He Picks Up The Gun And Runs . Then Who Did It ? The Only Person Who Would Have Known About The Secret Entrance . Peter Hardwick ? But It Would Help To Have A Motive . It 's More Than A Theory . Hardwick Was Having An Affair With Chloe . How Do You Know That ? His Son Implicated Him . I Didn 't Hear Him Say That . I Didn 't Say I Heard Him . I 'm Not Sure Lip Reading 's Exactly Admissible . Eddie . You 're The Dude Who Chased Me . I Thought You Were Dead . I Was . Now I 'm Not . Lucky Me . I Don 't Want To Face Another Murder Charge . Eddie . I Think You Loved Her . You Ever Been In Love ? I 've ! Loved . I 'm Talking About Something Else . I 'm Talking About ... Feeling Like You 're Drowning When She 's Not There . Did You Ever Feel That ? No . That 's What We Had . Eddie . But You Don 't Trust The System . Right ? Aren 't I ? Too Bad You Won 't Have The Chance To Do Something About It . Doctor Said You 're Well Enough To Be Transferred To Central Booking . Put On Your Pants . Spare 2 Bucks ? Buddy . How About 3 Bucks ? Keys . You Don 't Want To Do This . Shut Up ! Come On . Been A While Since We Did Something Like This . It Feels Good . Let 's See Where He Takes Us . What Are You Doing ? What Do You Want ? Do You Know Who I Am ? I Do . Eddie Riley . Yeah ? Listen To Me . That 's Right Listen To Me Very Carefully . I 'm A Very Rich Man . I Can Do Things For You . What Can You Do For Me ? Can You Bring Chloe Back ? Eddie - Shut Up ! Can We Just Talk ? Shut Up ! Shut Up ! Ok . Get Down On Your Knees ! I 'll Give You Anything You Want . What Are You Gonna Give Me ? What ? Like The Bracelet That You Gave Her ? She Hated It ! She Hated It ! It Was A Handcuff . Admit It . Look At Me ! Admit It . I Want To Hear You Say It . I Swear It Was An Accident . She Said She Was Gonna Leave Me . And Then Things Just Got Out Of Control . And You Dumped Her Body In My Apartment Like She Was Trash ? ! Please . Eddie . Put It Down . The Gun 's Empty . It 's Over . No One Gets To Die Today . Thought You Were Gonna Wait For Me . I Lied . You--You Didn 't Have To Come . I Did . Thought You Might Want This . Yow Asked Before How You Go On . You Do What You Can . Get Up In The Morning . It Changes . It Just Does . It 's Definitely An Original Benwaar . And In Impeccable Shape . May I Ask Where You Found It ? Goodwill . Then You 're The Luckiest Man Alive . Tell That To My Bookie . 000 ? I Did A Little Research On Him On The Internet . His Last Desk Sold At Auction 000 . I Could Go To 60 . Done . It 's Timeless . It 's As If The Artist Was Speaking To Us Today . Smoke ? I 'll Pass . Sure ? It 's Afzal Molasses Tobacco Infused With Peach Resin . That Stuff Will Kill You . Mcmanus Told Me What Happened To Your Last Partner . Said You Had A Death Wish . Really ? We Have To Trust Each Other . You Don 't Need To Worry About That . You Won 't Be Herelong . Your Application To Narcotics Wasn 't Denied . Your Father Buried It . He Wanted To Protect You . You Can Reapply In 3 Months . I Will . And You 'll Get In . But Why ? Who Are You Trying To Impress ? Amsterdam . You Don 't Need To . How Did You Find Out About This Stuff ? It 's What We Do . We Bring Closure To People Who Need It . You Seem To Need It . Closure .

 Previously on Fringe : - There is more than one of everything . Who the hell is this guy ? We 've recorded him at over three dozen scenes all of which relate to the Pattern . - Why ? What is he doing ? Watching . Observing . - We refer to him as the Observer . We were dead , Peter . Until someone grabbed me . We were saved , both of us , by a man that I had never met . - You talked to him ? He wouldn 't be any use . He just observes . I have said too much . I am not supposed to get involved . Nice specs . I 've never seen anything like them before . They 're from somewhere far away . I don 't have any money . Oh , that 's okay . I 'm gonna give you one of these anyway . There . Oh , that 's great . Thank you . - Come with me , please . - Excuse me ? What are you doing ? Get off me ! What are you doing ? Help me . Help me . - Hey ! - Let go . Help me ! - Let her go ! - Somebody help me , please . Somebody . Help ! GIRL : Please . Help me . Please . Help me . Help . Somebody . Stop ! Stop ! Morning . Good morning , Funny Face . You ready for our day ? Yep . This is the map Mom left for us . There 's four roller coasters . Oh , no , no , no . We agreed , no roller coasters . Go on any ride you like , but no roller coasters . - Because I am scared of the roller coasters . - Ha , ha . Oh , you think that 's funny ? You think that that is funny ? Okay . No roller coasters . Dunham . Where ? Uh , no , I 'll tell Walter and Peter . So we 're gonna have to take a rain check . That 's okay , Aunt Liv . I know you have an important job . Well , I 'm gonna call the Jacobsons and see if they can baby-sit . And then I 'II ... - Make pancakes ? - Yes , ha , ha . Then I 'll make you pancakes . - You 're sure it was him ? - Uh , we don 't have security footage yet but an eyewitness said that he was wearing a gray suit and a hat . Quote : " One of those old ones , from the ' 60s . " - We don 't have information on the girl ? - No . The police showed her picture around the museum . No one knew who she was . - Is Walter awake ? - Oh , yeah . He 's in ... - The kitchen . - But talking to him 's not gonna be easy . - Why ? Walter , we have company . Oh , hello , Agent Dunham . Walter , hey . I need you to tell me what you know about the man we call the Observer . You once referred to him as your friend . Seems he may have kidnapped a woman . They called it the Strawberry Supreme . His favorite ice-cream store shut down . He made me wait in line with him for four hours to get one last milkshake . They have a secret ingredient . It 's mundane , but it 's ... Oh , it 's sublime . And I 'm trying to stimulate my olfactory and gustatory senses to try to re-create it . Walter . Can you come with me ? We 've recorded him at over three dozen Fringe events . - Do you remember him ? Of course . But there 's nothing more than I 've told you before . Peter and I were in a car crash . In a frozen lake . When I was a boy . We were drowning , and he dove in and saved us . But you say he 's kidnapped a woman ? We think he may have . Why ? What are you thinking , Walter ? Hey , guys . The footage from the abduction has been downloaded . Also , the police found a book on a bench by the museum with some kind of weird writing in it . - They think it was his ? Well , they don 't know , but Agent Broyles is sending it over . Have we ID 'd the victim ? No , not yet . Wait a minute , Astrid . Can you zoom it ? Now freeze it . Peter , that isn 't him . That 's a different guy . There 's more than one Observer . Stop . Hold on . What just happened right there ? Was he hit ? Who are these people ? - Please don 't hurt me . - Please don 't hurt me . - Why are you doing this ? - Why are you doing this ? - Please let me go . - Please let me go . - I promise I won 't tell anyone . - I promise I won 't tell anyone . - You don 't have to do this to me . - You don 't have to do this . - Please . - Please . It will be safer if you stay quiet . Her name 's Christine Hollis . Twenty-seven years old , in the master 's program for fine arts at BU . Far as we can tell , she 's no one special . Parents deceased , no siblings , no arrests . Twenty-seven hundred dollars in her bank account . - Nothing unusual at all . - Do we have a home address ? We 're working on it now . Assuming she 's still alive . We have no reason yet to think otherwise . Well , that 's just it , isn 't it ? We don 't know what to think . I 'm lost . Twenty-four years ago , one of them saved Walter and Peter . Walter doesn 't know why . Can 't remember . But beyond that , everything we know about these guys the little that there is , suggests that they just watch . They don 't get involved . But now ... Figure out why he took this girl . What makes her the exception ? Do that , and I think you 'll find him . Hey , I think we may have a lead on the Observer . Walter , look at this . In his book . I think that might be blood . You might be right , son . Uh , scalpel , please . Did he ever tell you why he saved us ? The Observer . No . We 're close , Walter . Whatever 's going on , whatever William Bell was warning Olivia about these people have the answers . - I know it . I can feel it . - Mm-hm . - This does not make any sense . - What ? His handwriting . So far I have counted 1246 distinct characters and not a single one of them repeats . All right , not all of us majored in linguistics . It means every written language is based on repetition so without repeated symbols language is not possible . Well , maybe it 's a code . Maybe . But if so , it is the most complicated code I 've ever seen . The computer can 't make any sense of this either . Hey . What you got ? Nothing on the symbols , but we found a blood sample in the book . - The kidnapper 's blood ? Not sure . Walter 's analyzing it now . - Walter . - Well , ahem , we can 't be certain till we run the labs , but I 've noticed the blood has an orange tint . Perhaps a sign of hemophilia . Well , if it is his blood and if he 's a hemophiliac maybe he was treated at a hospital . There could be a record . I 'll call Broyles , have him get a list of known hemophiliacs . Guys , I think I 've found something . Looks like someone else has been investigating these symbols too . What ? Who is it ? These things have been blowing my mind for a while . Do you see the little half-circle with wings ? That appears on a cuneiform tablet at the Iraqi National Museum . It 's one of mankind 's earliest attempts at writing . And , uh , do you see this little triangular curlicue thingy ? It 's etched on the Iron Pillar of Delhi . Nine hundred B.C. It 's pretty weird , right ? So Nina Sharp says you 're FBI too . Uh ... You don 't look FBI . You have no idea what any of them mean ? - What the symbols mean ? - Yeah . No . I have no idea . But I found something else . We all remember Paul Revere 's ride . " One if by land , two if by sea . " But before that , he was famous for his engraving of the Boston Massacre . 1 770 . - Oh , come on . - Well , that could be anybody . Marie Antoinette . 1 793 . Sarajevo , 1914 . Minutes before Archduke Franz Ferdinand was shot kicking off World War I. So they 've been around forever ? Or else they 're not limited by our human perception of time . Are you with me ? We think of time as linear , right ? Life is a journey . You 're born and then you die . And to get from one end to the other there 's only one way through . Unless you look at it like this . And then you can see at any point . It 's all happening at once . - So they 're traveling through time . - No . It 's more like they 're observing time . I think these guys show up at important moments . Uh , historical , technological , scientific . But it 's rare . Maybe two dozen different definite occurrences in the past 5000 years of human history . But recently , I 've charted 26 sightings in the past three months alone . - It kind of makes you wonder . - Why now ? And what 's about to happen ? More hot sauce , gentlemen ? - Thank you . - Sure thing . We have a situation with August . OBSERVER 1 : Who is she ? OBSERVER 2 : I don 't know . But she 's supposed to be on Tropos Air flight 821 . Why did he abduct her ? We don 't know . And the flight has already left the terminal . Then he 's created an irregularity . We 'll need to repair it . Contact Donald . I just don 't understand it . Why would anyone wanna kidnap Christine ? That 's what we 're trying to figure out . So you two aren 't roommates ? No . We 're friends . We 've taken a bunch of sculpture classes together . I 'm subletting her room while she 's away . Was supposed to be away . - Where was she supposed to be ? - Italy . She was supposed to fly today . She was gonna spend the semester studying ceramics in Rome . Well , do you have a copy of her itinerary ? Her flight to Rome or maybe where she was gonna be staying ? She e-mailed me one . I can print out a copy for you . - Is this Christine ? - Uh , yeah . It 's a terrible story , actually . Her family was visiting relatives in San Francisco . A few hours after that photo was taken there was a big earthquake . The one in ' 89 ? They were driving on that bridge when it happened . The one that collapsed . Her parents were both killed . That 's the last photo she has of them . I 'II , um , get you her travel information . Take a look at this . Behind the father . Come on . Come on . I thought you might be hungry . You 've hurt yourself . Why are you doing this ? What do you want from me ? It would be easier to show you . REPORTER : Popularity polls show huge support for the president as the economy rallies and terrorism declines . The poll found that 63 percent of Americans are happy with ... It will be just a minute now . Phone . COMPUTER : Phone . Please say a command . - Call the Jacobsons . COMPUTER : Calling the Jacobsons . Whatever the Observers do to keep from aging they should market it . They 'd make a fortune . So , what does it mean ? That he has been keeping tabs on this girl for 20 years ? Hello ? - Uh , Ken , hi , it 's Olivia Dunham . I 'm just calling to check in and say hi to my niece . KEN : Oh . Jane just took her out for ice cream . You want me to call her ... ? No , no , uh , just let her know that I called . KEN : Sure thing . - Rachel 's out of town ? - Yeah . For the weekend . - And ? - And what ? You do that thing with your mouth when you 're upset . Heh . Oh , it 's ... Ella and I had this whole day at the amusement park planned and then dinner after . She was completely understanding when I told her that I had to work . When my mom took me to my first movie when I was 6 I was so excited . She bought me a box of popcorn , and we took our seats . They used to have that curtain before the movie started . It was this beautiful red velvet . We sat there eating popcorn . Ha , ha . And after a couple minutes , I turned to her and said : " Mommy , this is the best movie ever . " - I didn 't understand that it hadn 't started . - Ha-ha-ha . That 's one of my favorite memories of my mother . Don 't worry , you 'll make memories with Emma . REPORTER : New information on Tropos Air flight 821 which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean two hours outside Rome , Italy . The plane contained 211 passengers and six crew members , all of whom are assumed to be dead . - Flight 821 departed at 10 : 45 a . M ... - What ? Okay , Christine 's itinerary . It 's just in my glove box . REPORTER : ... early this morning . The plane was in the air ... Flight 821 . Boston to Rome . She was supposed to be on that flight . REPORTER : Rescue teams and divers continue to scour the wreckage . We will continue to bring you coverage of this disaster as it comes . Representatives of Tropos Air ... You were going to die . REPORTER : We will bring you live coverage just as soon as it happens . Right now ... AUGUST : I saved you . How did you ? You 're not safe yet . There is something I need to do . I have to go out . I would prefer not to gag you . But it is for your own protection . What if he did ? What if he somehow knew the plane was gonna crash ? You think Brandon was right , they can see events before they happen ? I 'm sorry , what plane crash ? Christine Hollis was supposed to be on a plane that crashed off the coast of Italy . - Two hundred people were killed . - Oh , dear . I mean , what if he wasn 't trying to kidnap her ? - What if he was trying to save her life ? - What 's special about her ? Why save her ? Why did one of them save us ? Walter . I 've got the results of the blood sample from the book . Oh . Ha , ha . High concentration of capsaicin . Which means it 's not blood at all . It 's chili-pepper juice . He must 've spilt some on the book . Well , that 's great news . We 'll add " messy " to the APB . No , it is good news . A concentration of 970,000 on the Scoville scale . That 's one of the hottest chili peppers there is . I hypothesize a naga jolokia from India , otherwise known as the king cobra chili . I once ate one . The flatulence was horrible . Very embarrassing . Walter , are these peppers sold in Boston ? Oh , uh , I imagine so though I don 't suspect one could grow them here . Astrid . Locate anyone who 's importing the peppers locally . Got it . Well , it appears you 've been busy . Your actions took us all by surprise . I take it you 've come here to explain yourself . Then you are aware of the plane crash ? Of course . Christine Hollis . Who is she ? I have observed this woman for much of her life . She is unique . They are all unique . That is not reason to interfere with the course her life was meant to take . We have interfered before . Only to correct a mistake of our own making . - She has no future . - Then why do I see it ? Why do I see that she is important ? Your perception must be in error . Perhaps . Your oversight will be forgiven , but Miss Hollis must be corrected . We 've already seen to it . You should eat something . - Thanks . If there 's something significant about this girl , I don 't see it . After her parents died , she was taken in by her mother 's friend , a veterinarian . She got decent grades in college and interned at art galleries in the summer . She 's just like anyone else . Hey , guys , I think I found something . Those king cobra chilies ? Three Boston restaurants imported them last year , and one private citizen . - Who ? - I don 't know . He paid with a money order . But we have an address . It 's an apartment in Cambridge . Give the address to Broyles . Get him to have a backup team standing by in case we need them . Sure thing . Taste this , please . - That 's what I was afraid of . - Mm ... Wha ... ? What is that ? French-vanilla ice cream and cough syrup . No , no . You see , I suspect the secret ingredient is wild cherries and I didn 't have any fresh cherries . Unless you would make a trip to the market . If I do , I am no longer your taste tester . Deal . You got my message . I suspected that a likeness of a nitrogen molecule would attract your attention . Please don 't take my son . Your friend and I had a deal . We had an arrangement . I know what I did was wrong , but ... That is not why I contacted you . I need your help . My help ? In that case , I should call him . And Agent Dunham . They 'll want to know I 'm talking to you . I suspect that they might be occupied right now . DONALD : On your knees . Down on the ground . Take it easy . Take it easy . Take it easy . What is it that requires my help ? I have interfered in the natural course of events . To correct that the others will try to kill Christine Hollis until they succeed . If we run , they will find us . If I stop the assassin , they will send another . I cannot see any course of action that will prevent her death . What makes you think I can help ? Because you have solved such a matter before . You saw beyond the limitations of your problems . Not really . I just missed my son . May I ask what is so important about Miss Hollis ? I cannot explain the reason . I merely see it . I have never experienced such certainty . But the others , they say she is of no consequence . Well , in that case , if you cannot persuade the others of your conviction then you must do something to prove it . You must make her important . And , of course , whatever you do you must be prepared to face the consequences . - The gunman leave a trail ? - No . I called in his description to the P.D. , but I expect he 's long gone by now . Broyles is sending in a CSU team to dust this place for fingerprints . I doubt he 's gonna show up on any databases . At least none from this century . What do you mean ? What Brandon said about them being around for a long time ? 1884 . Apparently , it was a great year for blubber . What ? What is it ? Do you trust me ? Yes . Then you must do exactly as I say . So far , we 've pulled two off the book . Got a possible match over here . Any ideas ? What are they looking for ? We 're looking for them , but they 're looking for something too . That 's why they keep on showing up . So , what are they looking for ? Dunham . Where ? Someone called in a description of our second Observer . He was spotted at a motel in Lowell . What are you doing ? Tell me where she is . Just tell me where she is . You know I 'm just trying to do my job . I have no quarrel with you . - Are you insane ? - Goodbye . FBI ! Christine Hollis ? Christine ? Christine Hollis ? Christine . Ugh . I 'm Agent Olivia Dunham . I 'm with the FBI . It 's gonna be all right . What ... ? What about the man ? The one who took me . Let 's get you home . Will she be safe now ? Who is she ? Why did you save her ? I saw her many years ago . She was a child . Her parents had just been killed . She was crying . But she ... She was brave . She crossed my mind . Somehow , she never left it . I think it 's what they call feelings . I think I love her . Will she be safe now ? Yes . You made her important . She is responsible for the death of one of us . So who was he ? How am I supposed to make sense of any of this ? Him . The plane . The guy who came after us . Did he say anything to you ? Anything ? Did he tell you why he saved you ? No . He ... He asked me to give you something . The bald man . In the event that he couldn 't . My dad won this for me playing Skee-Ball . I was holding on to it in the back seat when the bridge collapsed . Christine I think you 'll be safe now . When did you see the Observer ? And why didn 't you tell me ? What do you mean ? - I just did tell you . - No , that 's not good enough . We are so close . I can 't let these guys get away again . They have the answers . I know they do . Don 't worry , son . You 'll get your answer . Why don 't we go for a long drive together ? Perhaps pick up a tutti-frutti milkshake . The man you shot was named Donald Long . Ballistics tied his gun to six unsolved homicides up and down the East Coast . The earliest one dates back 10 years . - An assassin . - Maybe . - Do we know who hired him this time ? - We don 't know . Nothing in his car or on his person gave any indication . What about the Observer 's gun ? Techs have never seen anything like it . They can 't make it fire . Best we can figure , Peter shot off the last round . There 's one more thing . The tip-off that the Observer was spotted at that motel it was called in from one of the motel phones . Well , if he was trying to protect Christine and if he realized he couldn 't do it on his own ... Yeah . That 's what I thought . If it 's okay with you , I 'd like to take the rest of the day off . Sure . - Big plans ? - Yeah . Don 't worry , Aunt Liv , I 'll hold your hand . You better . - No , I 'm not gonna ... - No , no , no ! Look how happy she is . It 's a shame things are about to get so hard for her .

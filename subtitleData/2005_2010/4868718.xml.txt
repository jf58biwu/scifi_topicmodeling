 For those of you just joining us ... What you 're looking at is the work of Z.F.T. , a terrorist organization responsible for at least a half a dozen biological attacks over the last several months . Everything we know thus far can be found in your packets , including a copy of their manifesto , which elucidates their idealogy and their methods : " Destruction by the advancement of technology , " which in short boils down to the following : Attempting to provoke or prepare for a war . War ? With whom ? That 's the question , isn 't it ? What we do know is that these bizarre acts seem to be increasing in frequency . And that their targets are unpredictable , and therefore , unprotectable . Taxi . Taxi ! We 've recently developed evidence which suggests Z.F.T. is funded by an unlikely source and a name I 'm sure you 've all heard of . William Bell , founder and chairman of Massive Dynamic . Wait . Wait . Hold the bus ! You go Up Park , right ? Past Lenox Hill Hospital ? Yeah , six stops away . Are you feeling okay ? Fine . Let 's just go , please . Those of you assembled in this room now have a single , clear-cut goal To provide actionable evidence establishing a link between William Bell and Z.F.T. Special Agents Olivia Dunham and Charlie Francis will be assigning you to teams and coordinating the investigation . All efforts and information go through them . Now let 's go to work . Stop the bus . Stop the bus , please . I have to get off . Ma 'am , will you please sit down ? - I 'm not allowed to - - Please stop the bus , - I have to get off now . - Okay , okay . Open the door ! Oh , my God ! Please , please help . Somebody . Oh , my God . I can 't breathe . Oh , my God . Lady , you okay ? Yeah , it 's 911 ? The Road Not Taken Find anything new and exciting in there , Walter ? Huh ? Well , you 've read the manifesto about a dozen times cover-to-cover ... So just wondering . I need to show you something , Peter . Hey . - What 's going on ? - I don 't know . Show-and-tell , apparently . Walter ... What is this ? I don 't know what I 'm looking at . This typewriter 's Belly 's . I remember the day he purchased it . It was raining . Do you understand what you 're saying , Walter ? That William Bell doesn 't just fund Z.F.T. , he wrote their manifesto , and is actually responsible for everything that 's been happening ? Absolutely not . William Bell was many things . He was ambitious . He was egotistical . He was temperamental . But he wasn 't a madman . Although the ideas in his manifesto are radical , He wouldn 't do this - This-These horrendous things . He would never do it . There are references all throughout to the chapter of ethics . But there is no such chapter . It is missing . And I believe that someone has removed it to suite their own evil purposes . - And I can prove it . - How ? Get another copy of the book . One with all the pages . Walter , there is no other copy . This is the only one . I 'll get it . He wrote it here in , in this lab . The-It could still be here somewhere , the original . - And what if you 're wrong ? - I 'm not wrong . And when I find it , you will see . It will absolve him , Peter . Peter , it 's Olivia . So this is what I 've got so far . Bus driver called 911 , reported an agitated woman got off his bus . Moments later , she caught fire and exploded . Police combed the area . They couldn 't find any evidence of an accelerant or an incendiary device . If there 's something strange in your neighborhood ... Who you gotta call ? So what do you make of this , Walter ? Well , from what Agent Francis described , it 's possible we 're dealing with a case of spontaneous human combustion . Thought that was just a myth . Oh , myth is just an unverified fact . Maybe she was hit by a tiny meteor . It 's also possible . Until I get this body back to the lab , I won 't be able to say anything with absolute certainty . All right , I 'll get the coroner to prep the bodies for transport . Bodies ? Is there another somewhere ? You okay ? Yeah , I just ... Broyles . Send her in . - Phillip . - Nina . I won 't play coy , Phillip . I understand the FBI has opened an investigation into Massive Dynamic . As you can imagine , we spend a lot of money on counter-intelligence . And any probe into our finances raises red flags . So ... What are you fishing for ? Industrial espionage ? Treaty violations ? We have evidence that indicates William Bell may be involved with several biological attacks , perpetrated this past year . - But that 's ridiculous . - Perhaps . But as long as you 're here ... If you have something to offer , now would be the time . I 'm not one of your street thugs that you can bully , Phillip . And William Bell is not a terrorist . I 'd like to hear him tell me that himself . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . He 's traveling . You 're wasting your time . William Bell is not the enemy . Is there something else ? Matter is just energy waiting to happen . The average adult at rest contains enough potential energy to explode with the force of five very large hydrogen bombs . You know , theoretically , you 're actually right ? Ho ho ho ho ! My son finally agrees with me ! Uh , Agent Farnsworth , take a note of that . Unfortunately , we 're just not very good at releasing it . No . It needs a spark , of course . A trigger . So what do you think would 've released it in her ? Some say a particle is to blame - The appropriately named " Pyroton . " Maybe we could finally prove that it exists . Peter ! Fire up the electron microscope ! Uh ... About that , I might 've taken that apart . - What on Earth for ? - I needed the parts . For a project I 'm working on . As I said ... Potential for destruction in each of us is infinite ! Yes , Jim , I understand . Right away . I had you pegged as a creature of habit . You changed your office . Come again . Your desk . You moved it . Uh , we know from the driver what stop she got on . He 's worked up an artist sketch rendering . So we 'll canvass the area , see if we can ID her . What about the other victim ? Did the bus driver see her get on too ? Were they not together ? I 'm sorry . You mean one . There was only one victim . I 'm confused . Agent Dunham ? Where are we on this ? Uh , the bus driver remembered what stop she , uh ... What stop she got on . He gave us an artist sketch rendering . We 're gonna show it around and see if we can ID her . What the hell is going on here ? Sanford . Why is the entire 13th floor trying to link William Bell to biological terror attacks ? We have evidence that Bell might be implicated . Yeah , I know what you have . You have testimony from a dead man who himself was an admitted terrorist . Well , his testimony confirms what we 've long suspected . Massive Dynamic may be involved or behind the events we 've been witnessing . William Bell and Massive Dynamic are the Defense D epartment 's largest contractors . These waters are much too deep for a fishing expedition . Are you seriously suggesting that we just ignore ? I am telling you to drop this , considering that you have nothing more than an unsubstantiated report from a hostile source . Clear ? - Are we really going to - - No . Get more evidence . Just a few more centimeters . You know , Walter , working with you ... It 's amazing the sort of things you get used to . You 're not the first person to tell me that . Wow . Looks like somebody could 've flossed more . Okay . Let 's just hope that she has her dental records on file . File , of course ? My filing system . Perhaps that 's where I hid the manifesto ! You mean like how you seal things in the walls of your old house or how you squirrel things away in random deposit boxes around the country ? I would hardly call that a " filing system . " I was prone to hide things because I was afraid that someone would ... unlock all my secrets . I didn 't realize that the someone would be me . Where 's my Geiger counter ? I left it here . Wait , you think a radiation detector 's gonna help you find the manifesto ? No . But I find that the rhythmic ticking ... It emits helps me think . Oh , Walter , Peter actually cannibalized that for his project too . Oh , no , look ... This has got to stop . Lab rule number one : Do not borrow Walter 's equipment without asking ! Walter , we found a match on the victim . Her name is Susan Pratt . Thank you . We 'll take it from here . Susan Pratt . She 's 29 years old . Single . Worked for a New York Highway Department . Tollbooth operator . That 's a lonely line of work . Doesn 't look like she had much of a social life either . She 's definitely a table for one . Hey , Liv . You think there 's something wrong with her ? What do you mean ? You know , good-looking woman in the prime of her life . No evidence of a boyfriend . Or any friends for that matter . Just doesn 't exactly strike me as being normal . Well , I guess that depends on what your definition of normal is . Liv . Hey , Charlie , I think I found something . She has a $ 30,000 check from an Isaac Winters . I found something too . I think you should take a look at this . What the hell happened to her ? Walter , come back ! Did you get it ? No , I told you they don 't have it . Has to be franken berry , that 's what I ate back then . If I 'm to remember where I hid the manuscript , it 's simple sense memory , Peter . But they don 't have it . For all we know , they don 't even make it anymore . I did , however , get you this . All the artificial sugary sweetness a growing scientist needs . Hello , Agent Dunham ! Let me guess , you 're a cornflakes gal . Am I correct ? Uh , yeah . Why not ? So we went to the victim 's apartment and there appears to be evidence of other fires . So the bus stop wasn 't her first incident . No . Walter . Does that mean something to you ? Well , it changes everything . We can rule out spontaneous human combustion . For one , I mean , that 's strictly a one-off event as you can imagine . So what does it rule in ? Pyrokinesis . Stop . There 's no time for jokes , Walter . Pyrokinesis ? It 's not even a real word . It was made up by Stephen King . You ever see Firestarter with Drew Barrymore ? Little girl who can start fires with her mind ? Mr. King coined the term , but the phenomenon existed long before that . Well , it 's not that complicated , really . It 's merely a form of telekinesis . The ability to move objects with the mind . - Merely ? - However , with pyrokinetics , they can excite objects at a molecular level . Well , well , look , think , think of , of , of each of these grains of cereal as a molecule . Uh , as the molecules start to vibrate more quickly , they generate heat . Energy . Until that energy must be released ! It 's a fascinating demonstration , Walter . But it still doesn 't explain why it is that Susan Pratt blew up . I suspect this was a newfound ability . Well , it , it , it takes training to generate a heat source outside of the body . Without proper control , the energy is turned inward . You see ? She had no other options . So you think that she had a choice ... To either blow somebody else up , - or blow herself up . - Yes . But this poor woman had yet to master her ability . Which made her a powder keg . Emotional stress , agitation , any high anxiety would set her off . So where does this ability come from ? Is it that she was just born different or is it something that someone did to her ? That is the real question now , isn 't it ? I 'm not cleaning that up , by the way . Dunham . We got a hit from that check you found in Susan Pratt 's apartment . Uh , it was cut from a law firm . Signed by Isaac Winters . He has an office in Charlestown . No movement . Why am I not surprised you brought one of those ? Because you know me too well . If we get caught , I don 't know you at all . Looks like somebody left in a hurry . You have four new messages . Mr. Winters , this is Susan . Susan Pratt . You told me to call you if anything odd started happening . Well , it did , after I took the tests . Please call me back . I 'm gonna call ERT , have them dust for prints . Mr. Winters , it 's Susan again . You told me - You told me not to talk to anybody , but I 'm scared . What 's happening to me ? Attention , all citizens . Evacuate the area now ! Proceed to the nearest emergency shelter . This is not a test . Hey , Liv . You okay ? You sure you haven 't had any LSD ? Masculine and magic mushrooms . It wasn 't a drug trip , Walter . Well , visual hallucinations can be caused by a number of things . Could you look straight ahead , please ? Sleep deprivation , a concussion , brain tumor . I feel like I 'm losing my mind . Oh , I don 't think so . If you were actually going insane , you 'd likely have no idea what 's happening . Take it from me . When did these episodes start ? How did they feel ? First with Susan Pratt 's body . Then it was in Broyles ' office . The other on the street . The same people , the same places , but bleak . The , uh , the city was on fire . Fascinating . There 's another possibility , but it 's a bit complicated . Déjà vu . It wasn 't déjà vu , Walter . Not even close . Typical protracted déjà vu . Prolonged . What , you 're familiar with the - The pliability of space-time , yes ? Of course , who isn 't . One minute will explain . Most of us ... experience life as a - a linear progression just like this . But this is an illusion because every day , life presents us with an array of choices . As a result , life should look more like this . And each choice ... leads to a new path . To go to work . To stay home . And at each choice we take , creates a new reality . - Do you understand ? - Yes . But what does it have to do with déjà vu ? Déjà vu is , is , is simply a-a momentary glimpse to the other side . Almost everyone experiences it . We feel that we 've been somewhere before because actually , we have ... in another reality . It 's another path . The road not taken . Walter , why me ? Why am I seeing these visions ? I don 't know . Walter , what about William Bell 's drug trials ? Cortexiphan . You said that it worked on perception . Yes . If it 's true and I was part of the trials when I was a kid ... Is it possible that it 's causing these visions ? I don 't know . But what I do know is that you are a committed investigator . You 're a perceptive agent . If you are having these visions , whatever they are , there must be a reason . Trust me . Really , Walter ... From a man who routinely sees little green men prancing through the lab when Tam O 'Shanters on ? Hey , I think I found something . It 's another victim ... who died the same way Susan Pratt did . I checked it out and the guy who runs the web site lives in Malden . Yes ? Uh , my name is Olivia Dunham . I 'm a special agent with the FBI . We need to speak to Emmanuel Grayson . May I see your credentials , please ? Mr. Grayson , you operate a web site called " Galaxy Truths " , where you claim to uncover conspiracies perpetrated by foreign governments . I don 't claim . I accomplish . Unlike you two . You 're just pawns being used by the government to spread their propaganda . Look , I can appreciate your opinion , Mr. Grayson . - We just want you to ask a few - - No , no . Look . Look . You 're right , okay ? She 's a fed , but I 'm not . I 'm just like you . I am a citizen in search of the truth . Give me the photo . We downloaded this off of your web site . It claims that this person was a victim of spontaneous human combustion . Now you gotta tell us , where did this one happen ? Budapest . Three weeks ago . The victim was an American graduate student on holiday . The Hungarian police say he was attacked and set on fire . That 's not the truth . Why do you say that ? Are you familiar with William Bell ? Of course . William Bell killed these people . What do you mean ? William Bell 's company Massive Dynamic is a cover for all manner of unethical behavior . Multi-national , outside the purview of government control . He founded it to continue his experiments with impunity . Among them , secret drug trials . This was one of his test subjects . Then why would William Bell have him killed ? Well , he didn 't . At least not intentionally . You see , Bell is trying to activate his subjects ... to see which ones were successful . Some can handle the process . Others can 't . - What process ? - To create super soldiers . - Super soldiers . - Yes . Like Khan Noonien Singh . To defend us in a coming war . - What war ? - I 'm sorry . - The Khan ? - Yes . - As in the Wrath of ... - Yes . Let me guess . This war , it 's against ... The Romulans . Renegade Romulans from the future . Here to change the timeline . The sworn enemy of the Federation . The Federation . That would be the United Federation of Planets . - Yes . - Hmm . And you know all this because ... I am the Son of Seric . Which makes you Spock . Yes . Well , Mr. Spock , thank you for your time . We 'll let you get back to the bridge now . Live long and prosper . Okay , yes , you were right . But see that ? I 'm a big enough girl to admit when I 'm wrong . Oh , but I think we can prepare for that possibility . It shouldn 't be a problem . Uh , Mr. Prime Minister , I 'm very sorry , would you mind holding for just a moment ? Thanks . Hello . When ? Well , no . Don 't do that . Don 't do anything until I get there . Sir , I 'm so sorry . Something has just come up . If you 'll excuse me . Yes . You too . Get me to the helicopter fast . What if we 're overlooking something ? What if Emmanuel Grayson was right ? About which part ? Being from Planet Vulcan ? No . Forget that . But some of what he said made sense . We already know that William Bell conducted drug trials with experimental drugs . Cortexiphan , for one . Do you have anything stronger for my coffee ? Uh , yeah . Bottom drawer . In the cabinet behind you . And here I was halfway kidding . What ? What your father said about me having these visions for a reason . Maybe there 's a clue in them that I 'm meant to find . Meaning what ? We have one victim . Susan Pratt . But in my visions , there are always two bodies . - Who are they ? - I don 't know . Unidentified . But maybe if I could get back to that parallel universe as Walter describes , I can ID that second charred body . Maybe what 's happening there could help us understand - what 's happening here . - Happening where ? Nowhere . Your new assignment . Always a pleasure seeing you , sir . Hey ! Wait a sec . Harris . Can you stop ? You want me to submit for a psych exam ? That 's right . I 'm concerned for you . - Why ? - I 've read your briefs . And I 'd say your analysis borders on the paranoid . Besides which , your behavior 's been noted as erratic and driven by emotion and not just by me . Oh , that is not what this is about . My colleagues need to trust me . They need to depend on me . Not wonder in the back of their minds , whether or not I 'm losing mine . Look , this job is intense . - Not wondering to - - This has got nothing to do with my ability to do my job . - This is about something else . - This is exactly what - This is about you and me . - I 'm talking about ... Because right now , you are acting emotionally . Yes , you 're right , I am . You know , I 've tried to move past our history . I 've tried to reason with you in the interest of a working relationship . But you seem to get off on this . So fine . I don 't give a damn anymore . But I am not going to let you undermine my ability to do my job . You can color this any way you like , Dunham . But I am still your superior officer and that evaluation is a direct order . We need to get their statements ... You put a shoot to kill order out on the perps . You understand me ? Don 't get close to them . - Charlie . - Yeah , what 's up ? I was wondering where we were on the Susan Pratt case . We 're at nowhere . Same place we were yesterday . I 'd like to look again . You have half of Boston in quarantined lockdown . And you 're worried about a pair of charred twins ? Twins ? Sorry . Didn 't see you . We already ran Susan 's bio . - Well , we didn 't find a sister . - I know . And what makes you think - Look . You were right . Nancy Lewis . who went missing 11 years ago . Maybe Susan ran away . Changed her identity . She must 've been running pretty hard . Where does Nancy live ? She 's local . 934 Whittier . Thanks , Charlie . Hi . Can I help you ? Nancy Lewis , my name is Isaac Winters . Nancy Lewis . FBI . We need to ask you some questions . It 's unlocked . Nancy . Coffee 's still hot . Uh , this is Dunham . I need immediate forensic dispatch to 934 Whittier . Apartment 210 . Dunham . Take a look at this . The glass has been melted . You think she 's starting fires like her sister ? What is it ? I got an idea . I 'm not sure . I got it . Yeah , I knew . I had to , uh ... Please don 't touch that window . We haven 't pulled prints yet . You 're not gonna need to . I think the protocols and the processing of evidence are pretty clear . Let me guess , you 're new around here . - Is everything all right ? - Yeah , everything 's fine . Just tell Mr. Protocol to let me do my job , please . Uh , it 's okay . He 's with me . Are you , uh , ever gonna tell me what it is that you are actually doing ? Help me with this first . Hold the glass up here . Gently . We all hope that this is important . I was about to take my bathe . Hey . You have any problem taking it apart ? Walter tried to take back the electron microscope . But I convinced him that you needed it . So what 's going on ? Nancy Lewis was kidnapped . And we 're gonna find out who did it . I 've seen this woman before . But why does she look so familiar ? Maybe because you dissected her twin sister yesterday . Remember ? Blond girl about 5 ' 7 " . Really well done . Melted fillings . Astrid ... Can you plug that in to the DVI input ? Yes . Okay . Here 's the deal . Walter , the project that I 've been working on ... was for you . For me ? It reconstructs audio . I wanted you to be able to digitize some of those old water-damaged vinyl records you have . I know how much that mean to you . Thank you , son . You know , when he was five , he-he built me a popsicle napkin holder . Dreadful design . Utterly useless . Thank you . But this - This is ... You 're welcome . Anyway , the basic principles at work here are very simple . You all know how a record player works , right ? Yeah . A needle goes over the grooves of the vinyl and the vibrations it picks up are amplified into sound . Exactly . So the principle is the same . Except for instead of a needle , I use the electron microscope to take a high resolution , digital image of the grooves on the surface of the record . That image is then transferred into the computer , which translates it back into audio that we can hear . You sound just like him . I 'm guessing that with the software modifications I gave you , we 're gonna be able to do the same thing with this . So you 're saying that you can play back the glass somehow . Yeah . Walter says that these pyrotechnic abilities only occur during times of emotional stress . I think that when our twin was kidnapped , the heat that she generated caused that window to liquefy slightly . Which means ... that any sound that was in this room at that time would 've left microscopic impressions in the molten glass . Like the grooves on a record . Exactly right . Now if you 'll please scan the glass . Okay . You 're ready to go . All right . It 's transferring into the sound processor now . Let 's see what we got . That could 've been one of my records . It 's okay . It 's okay . I already have a digital scan of the glass in here . Let 's try that again , shall we ? Just slow it down . I don 't understand . It should be working . Yes . Yes . Now attenuate for ambient noise . Get out of here . Stay away . What do you want ? ! Please ! See you there . Poor dear . Peter , can you play it back from when he starts to talk ? Yeah . One sec . Okay , just there . Where he 's dialing . Okay , can you make that clearer ? Sure . Let me just ... isolate the sound . Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? My cell phone app can dial the number from the tones . This is Harris . Hey , Charlie . I 'm headed out for a few hours . Anybody needs me , I 'm reachable by cell . You got it . I got him , Charlie . He 's headed west . I 'm right behind you . Charlie , he 's approaching a warehouse off Moore and Adams . Roger that . We 're turning onto Adams right now . Hey . He used a remote to get in . I guess we go with the old-fashioned way . No thermal activity yet . Her body temperature 's normal . We 'll know more soon . Well , he 's losing patience . We need her active . Get it done . Liv , I heard gunshots . Are you okay ? Charlie , we 've got a man down . Charlie , I 've got her . Back northwest corner . I 'm Olivia . I am with the FBI . Help me . Please . Don 't worry . You 're gonna be okay . No ! Harris , open the door ! God damn it , Harris . Open the door . Open the door ! I can 't breathe . Well , look at that . Good work , Agent Dunham . You managed to activate her before we could . Damn it , Harris , open the door . She needs help . Not if she can control it . And if not , she 'll explode and kill the both of you . So one problem solves another . Ah ! I 'm burning up ! You 're gonna be okay . Just calm down . Just calm down . Yeah , it 's me . I need to speak to him . Just hold on . I 'm gonna get you out of here . It worked . She 's hot . We have an active . But she 's a loss . She 's highly unstable . Why is this happening to me ? They did something to you - Maybe to both of us a long time ago when we were just kids . And right now , you 're feeling the effects from that . But you can control this , okay ? You can control this and I 'm gonna help you . I just need you to focus the heat away from us . - No , I can 't . - Yes , you can . Just focus . Focus on anything . Just focus , Nancy . You can do this , Nancy . - No , I can 't . - You can . Yeah , I 'll take care of it . There won 't even be a trace . I , uh , uh ... Oh ! It 's okay . Everything 's gonna be okay . Oh , yeah . You 're gonna be okay . Oh , it 's okay . It 's okay . Okay . I think you got all of that , Walter . I 'm gonna use the bathroom . Be right back . Excuse me . Could you keep an eye on him , make sure he doesn 't leave ? Agent Dunham . Where 's Peter ? Peter 's in the bathroom . What the hell did you people do to us ? You and William Bell , Walter . What did you do to me ? Susan Pratt ... and Nancy Lewis are from Jacksonville , Florida . Just like Nick Lane , the guy that you conducted drug trials on when he was a kid . The drug trials that you conducted on me . They were Belly 's . They 're Belly 's trials . But you knew . Walter , you were there and you knew . We were trying to help . It meant no harm . No harm ? You were drugging children . Three-year-old children , Walter . Why did you do it ? We were trying to prepare you . To make you capable . Able . Something terrible is coming . - What ? - I don 't know . Walter , what did you do to us ? I don 't know . - Damm it , Walter . You do . - No , I don 't . I don 't . I - I can 't remember . I 'm sorry . Hey . Hey . Walter . What just happened ? Nina . What is it ? These were all taken in the last 24 hours . You know what happened the last time he appeared with this kind of frequency . We need to talk . Astrid , I found it . The original manuscript with the extra pages . I was right . Listen to this . " Our children are our greatest resource . " We must nurture them and protect them . " We must prepare them so they can one day protect us . " You see , I was ... Hello , Walter . Oh . Hello . It 's time to go . Is it time ? I 'll get my coat . Evening .

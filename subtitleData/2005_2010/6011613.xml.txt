 You Colonel Gathers ? What ? No , you don 't ! What do you want from me ? Who sent you , you bastard ? Special Agent In Training , Brock Samson , reporting for duty . Don 't you salute me ! Leave that Little John John crap back in Biloxi . - Yes , sir . - And don 't " Sir " me , damn you ! You 're not in the Marines any more . This is intelligence . Start using it ! OK , Colonel ... Call me Hunter . Now let me get a good look at you . God , they 're making them big nowadays ! Don 't they know there 's a gas crunch on ? Look at the size of you . Samson , Brock . Born Omaha , Nebraska to a single mother . Half Swedish , quarter Polish , quarter Winnebago . You lost your virginity at 14 , have one brother and you enjoy motocross . The Brock Samson you knew and were is dead . Happy birthday , Frankenstein ! You 're OSI 's baby now . - Will you do whatever your country asks ? - Yes . Can you keep your head when confronted with mind-blowing weirdness ? - Are you ready for anything ? - Yes ! - Are you still ready for anything ? - Ye ... Wrong ! Lesson number one , trust no one . When God created the third cave man ... a conspiracy was hatched against one of them . Get up , damn you ! Strap her on , kid , your training starts now . When we 're done ... you 'll belong in the elite agency that 's been defending this country ... since the second American Revolution . The invisible one . Welcome to the Office of Secret Intelligence , Samson . Shouldn 't be gone too long . Compound 's got a pretty good security system ... but if anyone manages to break through , we also have a panic room . I doubt you 'll need that , though . OK , you 're good . Dean ? - Any questions ? - Yes , one . - What the hell are you doing ? - The monthly head lice check . Figured I 'd get it out of the way , so you don 't have to worry about it . OK , you 're good . Wait . OK , you boys get into your PJ 's and you come say good night . Jeez , they 're gonna be here any minute . Brock Samson . The most feared man in espionage ... a nanny ? Pathetic . Brock , your talents are wasted on these ... civilians . Quit the OSI , go freelance with me . We would make such a team . Save it , Mo , this is my job . Well , was until I got this mission . So for the next couple of days it 's yours . I 'm trusting you to protect these people . From what ? Bed bugs and tummy aches ? You 'd be surprised how many enemies Dr. Venture has . We get into some pretty hot situations here . Brock , which of these looks better the velour or the Italian knit ? - Hello . - Doc , this is Molotov Cocktease . I hired her to watch out for you guys while I 'm on assignment . Charmed . And I got some iodine on this . Do you have time to get that out before you go play cowboys and Indians ? Say the word and he 's dead . We could be in Monaco by midnight . - Pardon ? - Doc , come here with me a second . - Did you check her references ? - Yeah . Great ! She 's one of your hussies , isn 't she ? You 're putting my life in the hands of a hussy . She 's a mercenary not a ... hussy . Did you have ... relations with her ? No , I didn 't . Well , then Rusty calls dibs . Gosh , she must jazzercise night and day . Hi , I 'm Hank . No , it 's not costing you anything . What is she , an intern ? She 's getting credit for this in Murder School ? I worked out a trade . You know how Russians are goofy for American jeans ? Well , I snagged a planeload of them last time we were down in Bolivia . Manaconda ! All right , she 's nimble , I 'll grant you that . - But can she close the deal ? - Wait . Wo-manaconda . That 's me . Later , Doc . Later , boys . You take care of them , Mo . Well , what say we get you settled in ? Shall I make up the fold-out couch in my dad 's old study for you or ... would you be more comfortable in the master suite ? Get something straight ... I am here only as a favor to that man whose feet you aren 't even fit to kiss . I am not protecting your lives , I am saving his . Because by the time he gets back you will no longer need a babysitter . I 'm going to turn you into men . The agency thanks you for taking this hiatus from operation Rusty 's Blanket . This is the standard Office of Secret Intelligence field kit . There 're some new additions since you were last briefed ... so take a moment to familiarize yourself with ... Gay , gay , useless , never use them ... Smokes . These I can use ! Do they do anything stupid ? Well , the filters each house a tiny , state of the art ... At least take the pen . You never know when you might need a pen . Or is it ? Go ahead , ask me what it does . This is my field kit . - This the client ? - Yes , sir . Rogue agent . One of our own . - Hunter ! - Did you know him ? He was the second-closest thing to a father I ever had . Bummer ! 'Cause we need him dead . 48 hours ago he went A.W.O. L ... with 40 mill of the agency 's money and a head full of national secrets . He was spotted in Geneva but he vanished before we could bring him in . Not before he kidnapped the enemy 's top plastic surgeon though . - So how do I find him ? - Captain Swallow will brief you from here . It 's been a real pleasure meeting you , Mr. Samson . Good luck to you . Can 't swim , my ass ! You 're from the country , damn you ! You just haven 't been properly motivated . Yes . Yes . Yes , do it . Do it , boy ! Goddammit , you are ready for the field ! Stand down , stand down . Stop and think ! Stop and think ! If I was the enemy you 'd be dead already ! Macronesia , this is where we lost the signal ... from the hostage 's subcutaneous homing chip . Our guess is Colonel Gathers is still somewhere in that vicinity . We need to find him and take him out quickly . Before he has time to change his identity and disappear forever . - How was the lobster ? - Excellent . But Macronesia 's three days away by sub . - What is this , a ' 59 ? - ' 58 . - How are we gonna get there in time ? - Not we , you . And not via submarine . Via this . Dragon , eagle , mantis ... monkey , tiger , snake , leopard . These are called " the maimers . " Strike at your enemy with one of these , and they will be your enemy no more . This is called binding . With my opponent in this hold I can have my way with him . Now ... spar ! It works ! I never used to beat Hank ! Who da master ? ! Who da master ? ! Focus , Hank , your opponent has you on your back . Are you going to let him win ? - Sho ' nuff ! - Nyet , Hank ! Nyet ! Your improvisation was excellent , but we 're not up to weapons training yet . Holy crap , you made me kill Dean ! Sudden drop in blood pressure , he 's only passed out . Well , what are you waiting for ? Pin him ! - Yeah ? - Samson , we have a problem . I 'm kind of in the middle of something here , Mo . What 's the deal ? You should be able to handle them . Please , of course I did . But you neglected to tell me this compound ... is built on top of an Indian burial ground ! Crap ! Is it the anniversary again already ? All right , look , you wanna call Dr. Orpheus , he 's a necromancer ... he 's right over in the east wing . He 'll clear that right up , no problem . Look , I gotta go . You gotta keep this channel clear unless it 's a real emergency . Normally I just come over and take care of this on the 25th ... but I forgot this was a leap year , and , well , the Apaches didn 't have those . So easy to lose track of matters temporal in my vocation . My apologies for the error , Miss ... Cocktease . - Of course . How do you do ? - Thanks for coming , Dr. O. - Too bad you can 't stay longer . - I don 't really have to be anywhere . I said , good day , sir . Well , after that rigmarole I could use a night cap . Care to join me ? I 've been squirreling away ... a bottle of cooking sherry for a special occasion , but ... well , heck , this is cause enough for celebra ... Some , other time then . No , no , it sounds delightful ! I 'll get the glasses . However will we pass the time ? What are you doing with Danica Patrick ? - I 'm over her . You want this ? - Nah , not my type . Wanna keep the Fun-Tak , at least ? Not Mary Lou Retton too ? What 's going on with you ? Dean , Dean , I sometimes forget you 're younger than me . By a lousy four minutes ! Well , then maybe in four minutes you 'll understand . It took a real woman to finally show me that these girls ... fine athletes and easy on the eye both , were but the mere crushes of a boy . And you , my friend , are looking at ... a man . You 've finally got ' em ? A gentleman never asks and a lady never tells . Morning , Molotov ! I made you ... Hank , you shouldn 't sneak up on me like that . Venture residence , Hank speaking . - Hank , hey pal , I forgot to tell you ... - Is that Brock ? Let me speak to him . Samson , where are you ? Come on , Mo , you know I can 't tell you that . So you do remember how to be a spy . When are you coming back ? - Why , you miss me ? - I miss the man you used to be . Perhaps you 'll find him on this mission . There you are . Listen , today 's the day I do my marketing ... Is that Brock ? Checking up on us ? Well , don 't you worry your pretty blond head about me . While you 're on your little vacation , me and my hotshot new bodyguard ... will be skipping down to the Bohacks , thank you . - Why 's my brother dressed like that ? - I didn 't ask . I thought you two just liked to dress like idiots . And don 't tell Orpheus but I ... " borrowed " his Sunday paper , which means , that 's right ... a double coupon . Hank ! When do we get to do something ? Stakeouts are 80 % of the job . Don 't pull at that ! A convincing cover is the other 20 % . So , no women , no children ... No women , no children . Them 's the rules . - Separates us from the baddies . - What if she 's an enemy agent ? - An assassin ? - No . A double-agent assassin who just killed the President ? No , sir . Non-lethal takedown only . President 's not the President anyway , you know that . How about , you know ... A lady Dracula ? You mean , Le Vampyr ? Nosferatu ? - Yes . - Undead . Not technically a woman in that regard , so you got no beef there . Also , fictitious . - Do not eat that , it 's C-4 ! - Woman ! 50 laps . No lunch until you 're through . - Yes , ma 'am . - I thought I was excused . Your foot does not excuse you from training . Everything through chapter four by noon . That 's one ! Dr. Venture , I didn 't realize . No , no , it 's ... fine . I was thinking of painting an accent wall there anyway . You know , jazz up the rumpus room a bit . You 're bleeding . Let me help you . Twelve ! - Hey , Dean . - Triana ! Thank God ! - Nice bod . - Thanks . I 've been working out . A lot . We came over to use the pool , is that cool ? No , it 's not cool . Nothing is cool . You seem a little weird . Are you guys OK ? She 's killing us ! Listen , we kinda got off on the wrong foot , you and I. And I don 't mean the one you just kicked my teeth in with , I mean earlier . So fine , if you 're not interested in the 135 pounds ... of grade A American come-and-get-it , I can respect that . But ... we can at least be friends . Right ? So ... tell me , friend , you might know this ... the whole Russian mail order bride deal on the internet , is that on the up-and-up ? I wouldn 't know . Because those Chinese ones are a real racket . The damn thing was already dead when the crate finally showed up . And Hank , I don 't know what his deal is . It 's like he 's actually enjoying this . - The Scooby-Doo kid ? Where 'd he go ? - He 's swimming laps . Would you mind ? I only allow Brock to smoke outside or in the hangar . Allow him ? ! You do not allow Brock Samson to do anything . He allows you to live . And every day that he does so , you should bow down and thank ... Nyet ! - Milk breath . - Incredible . Hank , we 've got big troubles . The Apaches are back ! - What ? - Look . Teepee in your trunks . My pants are haunted ! My pants are haunted ! It 's time . You better skedaddle , this might get hairy . No women , no children . So , you have turned . Hello ? Miss Cocktease ? Anyone ? I can 't believe you kept it . I like it with the boots on . You Cockease ! Does it hurt , my little Samson ? Let mama kiss it better . Incredible . Incredible ! Wait ! She took the cigarettes ! - Do you want me , Hank ? - Yes , sir . Your father will never let us be together . He 's a big old doody-head who wants me all to himself . - He 's a jerk . - Yes , Hank , he is . But what are you going to do about it ? Kill pop . Kill pop . Kill pop . You should kill pop . It 's the only way . It 's the only way . Kill pop . We should kill pop . It 's the only ... way . - Father ? - Yes , Hank ? I want to kill you . That 's nice . Play pirates somewhere else , boy , your father 's busy . Hank , nyet ! Please ! Don 't ! Molotov ... I want to ... Come on , baby ! Back . I don 't have orders to kill you but I will if you get in my way . Please . The Colonel gave me a message for you . " Brock , I knew they 'd send you . After 40 years ... " After 40 years , I 'm finally tired of the game . The years of secrets and lies , of living with constant danger of being exposed . I know you 'll understand , Brock . " I know you 'll understand . " I have my orders . He 'd understand that . Please , let him have his peace . I intend to . What the ... What the hell did you do to him ? Only what she asked me to do . This man was like a father to me . Well , think of this woman like a mother to you . Your father . Your mother . Your father ... Your mother ... He 's your mother . No women , no children ! I 'll see you around old friend . That took a lot out of me . You 're going to be OK ? OK . Had to be sure . All set . You can 't tell me you don 't miss the action , the danger . The moral ambiguity , the weirdness . Yet you choose to live here . Last chance , Samson . What 's your answer ? Sorry , Mol , but ... go Team Venture . Bye . - Where 's Hank ? - Up in his room . - Our little man is grounded . - What 'd he do ? Get this , I 'm working in the lab , and Hank sleepwalks in ... hauls off and smacks me in the head with a papier mâché sword ... pees his pants and passes out . - So , I didn 't miss much ? - What 's there to miss ? Ca , c 'est de la bonne soupe .

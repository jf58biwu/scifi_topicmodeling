Russians pay their research ads from the ' 90s . Friends , get used . There will be eight more . - Come on . - Ted , you can . You can not , come on . Everything is fine . All systems are green , ready for takeoff . Each astronaut know the rules of the jungle . Animals are not limping into space . They remain on Earth . Where they die and are eaten . I am a monster . - You 're a monster . - Worse than that . I 'm sorry , recently hospitalized nun space , which means doomed to be an astronaut mere existence in the space program . Everybody is watching me . I 've seen that look before . Here 's how to order animals to die . Those are looks stunned and amazed . " They are astonished to eat my lunch ? They are astonished to move . If you have problam with my uterus would be lying on the floor with a scoop of ice cream at my side . That was the second day . Now I feel much better .

You 're going to sit here and just going to eat . - You do not want half my sandwich ? - Why ? Because I am weak ? Because I seem to need more food ? You monster ! Has there been an increase in gamma radiation ? No , we have detected . My temperature is rising . I feel the pulse quickens . Open . Go ! Run , run ! Close . Ted Shaw . A pulse . Something like a heartbeat ? No , it 's like a wave . Reaches a peak and then disappears . It has happened a few times . Have you had a fever or your face has turned red ? - Yes , a little . - You will experience more intense hallucinations . - How Mintz ? - Maybe . He was convinced that was patches due to psychotropic drugs . And it must continue to believe it . Have you seen someone else ? - Paula has a slight fever . - I will monitor his condition . Donner said experience something well then do not say anything . He is an astronaut . Not only astronauts keep secrets , Ms. Shaw . I know . But I ask Ted . You watch them all . And yourself . Thanks , I 'll take . See who speaks mom . - Daddy ! - Hi , Roy . - Tell why you 're here . - I came to watch the commercials . When greeting from space Do you know who you stay healthy ? To you .

It is dark . It is quite dark where your trick daddy will . But you know what I do when I 'm scared ? I think of all the sweets I 'll have when when finished . It makes everything worthwhile . The boys astronauts should not be afraid . So let 's see . Four human with more training in history will use their skills to launch to the deep , relentless blackness of space , so that we can ask sweet 10 billion dollars . And if something goes wrong , die on live TV . Frankly , I do not care what are the risks involved . I 'll do anything for leave the ship . I 'm the first to admit . I am addicted to EVA . Addict . Indeed , ten billion dollars buys a lot of science . Science ? The money from the mission secured the release of the ship . These commercials pay for the sauce . Wait a minute . " Since when science is in the sauce ? Yes " And we 're not here just for that ? You mean , besides the flight plan and industrial aspirations ? Answer me this . What first removed in the first cut ? - Science . - Yes science . Trick or truth , ladies . Trick or truth . It 's my favorite holiday , I 'm at a spacecraft and I feel like shit . Is isolation . Strange to others . No , I 'm here with some sanctimonious , and can not use a disguise . Everyone here has both fear of being stupid . What happened to the spirit in Major Tom ? Major Tom is 35 million kilometers away . So what ? We are astronauts living in a can , rolling in a vacuum . Somehow dressing like vampires or pirates not so interesting . Not to mention Day the Dead , is to honor the dead . Not to corrupt them . Do you squeeze both breasts to become so prudish ? Okay . Selnes wants we use the cameras 24 , 35 92 and 120 . Nadia , you have to move the arm at 92 . Who are you ? Who 's who ? " Nadia ? Nadia ! - What day they give you peace ... - And good health . Not a bad doctor Ra . - Thanks . - Nothing . You lack the belt . It says you are very detailed . Really ? What more to say about me ? That you 're mysterious . Influential . And someone said ... you went in the opposite all of the ISO . It was not so bad . That 's what they say because you were hired . Actually work independent suppliers . And they say they 're related with training . - The selection of the crew . - Yes Just a little bit of everything . That 's why I talk to you . To know you a little better . How about tomorrow after work ? " To drink ? Why not now ? And I must warn you ... may be quite detailed . It 's just a few minutes of your time . It is on Mars . Are you sure you do not want to come ? I have extra costumes . I 'm not in the best mood . I 'm taking a hot bath , bed . - You okay ? - Yes Never better . And you are ? I 'm Greg Maddux . My namesake . Hall of Fame in the 80s . Nice . Nice . I guess what you used in the secondary in each Halloween . Yes Somewhat . - And you what are you wearing ? - Baseball am a cheerleader . Baseball has no cheerleaders . She is from Germany . I am a cheerleader German baseball . With clothes rack ? Very nice . Sorry you can not go , Zoe . You feel very weak . What tremendous suffering . We all talk about how you must feel terrible . - Please go to rest . - Yes - Take it easy , okay ? - Thanks . I will . Well . Good night . - Okay . - Bye . Okay . " Now you want go trick ? - I do not like asking for candy . - I do . Hello . Give me 20 minutes . I am going . What ? Nothing . It was nothing . You just flip head , so ... I thought someone was here . I was wrong . - Can I help with the costume ? - Sure . Thank you . See ? This is what I speak . Zoe has been uploaded the heartbeat . So Ted receipt , Paula Evram and Donner . They also have mild fever . Me too . Even from here ? " Eve ? Apparently , the distance does not matter . All these hallucinations the Beta cause . We 're not sure , if reality are hallucinating but are experiencing something . Increased heartbeat and body temperature . - How do you experienced in the past ? - Also feel now . Usually the pulse of Beta goes to a crescendo and then stops . And where we are in this symphony ? - It 's getting stronger . - Why ? Why now ? What is trying to do ? We will broadcast live to million people worldwide . I do not think it 's coincidence . What I could get ? We 've been hiding . Crew in the world . What do I know ? Maybe want it to be revealed ? No . Not now . Not in these conditions . Do we have an alternative ? Just one . We believe that this set of inhibitors of libido is contaminated . What we see indicates that at the far side of the spectrum may have a chemical reaction , serving as psychotropics . No . Wait . " Astronauts are drugged ? No , but there may be disorientation and mild hallucinations . Amazing . The specific pollutants have not been discovered yet but now we are testing . Do not think we want to risk the safety of our team to make candy business . Nadia . Evram . I thought ... You scared me ! Really ? You ? - You okay ? - No , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Keep me in the lock of pressure . " Contaminated batch of Halo ? Really ? I feel very good . Everyone Mild fever except Jen and Was . We are concerned that psychotropic drugs . How that cause hallucinations ? Definitely could explain what 's happening to me . But anyway we will record the commercial . Being negotiated . Wait . We are talking about 10 billion dollars scientific research . All we have to do is come out and say " We want candy . " An hour ago you thought was a waste of time . That was before I knew financing . If you withdraw from the program , nothing to do now be properly analyzed . At least not while we live . If we do this trade , certainly not going to give us money . Are they aware that this is not is just a commercial for candy ? This is an international event . We have bought advertising worldwide . We understand that there will be a clarification at the highest level . And of course , wait to cover costs . More than a billion dollars . In addition to the ten thousand billion , not obtained for this mission . Do not lose control . We can reprogram it to flying around Mars . " Next year ? Who will be interested in the next year in this mission ? They are old news . Look . The sum is obviously important , Mike . We 'll have to cut some programs . Science . But in terms of potential problems and not something real why not ask the crew ... . to know how they feel ? I feel good . I am in perfect condition . And certainly do not have hallucinations . I do not want to lose those dollars to science . Ready to go . I do not know what we are actually talking about but if there are problems with the halo , so we do not use , Will that be enough ? We are two . I promised my son that greet from space . That 's what I do . From my point of view all are healthy . And without hindrance . Just like me . Astronaut . Then we 're ready to go . - Let 's do it then . - Yes , sir . Antares , are allowed to go . Understood . - Hi mom . - Hey baby . - Is it time for Dr. Ra ? - Yes It 's time . I hope you 're ready ! Rollie said that Ted will as Dr. Ra . So I thought about going as Dr. Zu . How do you wear ? As something that never will be . But no . No , no , no . Oh , my God ! Astronaut pregnant Yes , folks . Exactly . They can stop look with his sad eyes because I returned and was river with you . Classic case of overcompensation . You are probably under all medicine . I hope it is enough intelligent not to drink . I need a drink . This is an invitation to disaster . Well , Nadia . And Was You are ready to assemble the cameras ? Confirmed . We are ready to go . Ted are you ready ? Correct . We only hope buckets with candy . Well . Wait a minute . We have 12 minutes to broadcast live . I understand . I hope you can see this probably have seen Comet Candy the trade a hundred times . But this is a glimpse behind the scenes to see how we did . The astronauts prepare to enter the pressure chamber that is our gateway to space . The pressure chamber is where depressurizing the atmosphere so that be the same as in outer space . Then we can exterior doors open ... " Hector ? " Hector ? Paula ! Paula ! - Ted , you okay ? - I 'm fine . Everything is fine . I sweat like a pig . For Next time we make a on deodorant commercial . Ajay . Can you pump some of air space suits ? Yes , let 's see what we can do . Ted beats are on 130 , Zoe and Donner have more than 120 . What is Dad ? The biggest astronaut . Come , come to my station . I 'll give you headphones and listen . - You okay ? - Yes Well , folks . We are in T minus 10 for the event . We opened the transmission now . " Hector ? Paul , where are you going ? " Hector ? Help ! - Paula . - You 're OK . Dying . My God . - Who ? Who dies ? - You 're OK . - You 're OK . - Paula , who is dying ? It 's my dog , Hector . It dies . - Paula , Hector is not here . - You 're OK . - My dog is dying ! - Paula , is a hallucination ! Are you okay ? - You 're doing it again . - What ? You do it again . As if heard something . What do you hear ? I do not know what you mean . Friends , can we leave the until we finish this conversation ? Did I tell you that my son sees me ? Roy is in control of the mission . I 'll say hello . Okay . Let 's do it by Roy . And ten billion dollars . - Science for all . - And for good science . - Flight , pressurizing the chamber . - Roger , Antares . - Opening of the gate . - Ready to go . Disabling magnetic gravity . Gravity Magnetic disabled . Confirmed . All right , folks . Let 's do it . Ted ! Ted , you got a problem ? I understand you do not want speak of the mission . Perhaps you 've suffered enough . But let 's go back there and I have the experience of astronauts . I can not say more than has already read somewhere . I hear firsthand . From you . Sure . The retailer . God is in the details . I do not know if you have felt responsible the loss of someone . Yes Like you . And still haunts me . Tell me about the storm . Donner and I were packing equipment . - The last day of the mission . - Sharon and Walker ? Sharon and Walker were three miles of us . The Rover . Doing experiments . Afterthought . The Rover was broken because filled with dust , so had to return on foot . And the storm just ... Do surprised ? We expected but we knew that be so bad . We try to plan very well for everything . We cover all contingencies . We do the maximum effort to avoid failure . Disappointed members crew to the mission . It happened so quickly . One , two , three , I will not pay for these ! Must be the sixth round . Would you stop worrying by Zoe Barnes ? It 's a big girl , Donna . You can take care of herself . Amazing . " It can not least call and say it 's busy ? Some have too much work . I do not want an explanation . Just a little courtesy . I tell you , because to become Dr. Zu in the last minute was not easy . Please ? I bet the the wig and blouse you have in your wardrobe . I know the things you have there . - I want some sympathy . - Okay , what about me ? - Shall we dance ? - No , no , no , no . The last thing I want to do is dance . The last thing I want to do it seems that ... last thing I want to do dancing . Understand ? I understand . Want to dance ? Astronaut pregnant , baby . I like it . - For the baby . - For the baby ! So , Dr. Ra not come ? Never trust a Vurgiano . Sure . Can you tell me what the hell happens ? Ted , we have six minutes to reach their places . We just want to know what happens . Ted , are we to do ? We need to go . Ted , do you get ? - Surgeon ? - The pressure is off the scale . You were not doing better either . Nobody is . - Mintz ? - Evram , are you in the airlock pressure ? No . I 'm with Paula on the corridor . Hallucinations are ... We can not move . I understand . Do not try . In five minutes we are on live around the world , people . In five minutes I need that are in place . - What about Daddy ? - No problem . Papi 's fine . It seems he is afraid . Dude , I know something is happening , but tell me , tell me . Come on , Ted . Look at us ! Initiate the launch sequence . - Ted , we can not leave here . - You are right , we can not . Sharon ? Walker ! Move . Donner and you thought could do it . That they had a chance . They were within a hundred yards . That 's less of a rugby stadium . And Goss wanted to leave . We all have moments we regret . No need to feel guilty . My authorization will allow me to full access to the files . I 've seen the records of the cabin , the telemetry . Sharon measurements and Walker spacesuit . I 'm a retailer , Ted . And I came to tell you they would not do it . Excuse me . Calm down for tomorrow morning do not feel so bad . You just say , Donner . VALMER . - VALME ? - Go to the m . .. - I do not swear . - Oh , I curse . I curse , I swear . I who stayed home with astronauts . - Tequila , Tommy . - Tommy , canceled the order . Two water . I told VALMER . Nadia is here just because ... Not interested , Donner . I do not care what you do . They 're your rules . Watch your ass , going there with Mr. Veteran . I know it 's charming but is a legend in candidates up drunk . - And you 're very drunk . - Watch your ass ! ? What ? Are you my copilot ? Are you watching ? Do you have something to say , Mr super driver " I was on Mars , the tragic American hero . " I do not need a copilot . I take care of myself . - I belong to this program . - I know . I told you . - I have sacrificed for this program . - I understand too . Really understand what Donner ? Mr. " I have my rules " I do not think you have no idea . Do not think you ... You know what ? You never know so I stopped to be in this program . - It 's all yours now . - You 're making a mess . Tequila , Tommy ! Maybe we should go for something to eat and the air . No . - You know ... - Take her home . I never ... You would expect all ... Especially me ... - Come on . - You stay here . Donner , go . I 'm always sick when I 'm with you . Our relationship is based on vomiting . I think better than I take home . Zoe ! Zoe , what 's up we go ! Are you listening ? What about you , curse ? Ted ? Look at me . We can do it , Donner . It 's now or never . We gotta go . Donner , we have to concentrate . Two minutes for transmission . Two minutes . It 's time to go . Donner ! Where is my banner ? Nadia , I see the banner ! - Ted ? - Nadia ! It 's fine , Dave . She says she 's seeing someone in the chamber . Come on , Ted . Look at us . Please , Ted . We can not leave here . Do it by Roy . Do it for science . Please come . Ten billion dollars . Come on , Ted , do it . - Someone should . - We can do it , Donner . No . No , Sharon . Please . Please ! We can do it , Donna ! No . We can not . Flight aborted . Are you listening ? Donner confirmed . Abort . Return all to the ship . Amazing . Ten billion dollars . That hurt . Put aside once and for science . Sorry , folks . Sorry if I disappointed . But I 'm fine , right ? You were not alone , Ted . We all went . Does anyone still have hallucinations ? - I 'm fine . - I have a little , but I 'll survive . - I 'm fine . - Me too . This Halloween is a disaster . I hope you are so ashamed and I 'm disappointed . I can not believe it . Expect to hear from our lawyers . The only shame I have suffered is to see astronauts wear buckets of candy into space . About the rest , my people made the right decision . Hopefully you feel that way morning . It has that . Maybe next time , folks . Mahalo , Mike . Fairly Aloha . Have you finished ? His vital signs begin to normalize . Over , but there is no guarantee that does not happen again . Roy , did your mom is going to carry trick ? Papi did not . There is a reason that nobody wants to show fear . We took it as sign of weakness . How to display the wound . In the Darwinian world , as food becomes vulnerable . Okay , I will order . But there is also a risk to arrogance . If not recognize your own limits . And may be the greatest from all dangers . In the cafeteria did not want talk of sandwiches . What I meant to say was that you made the right decision . You should never look back or feel remorse . Because your way is in the space . You know . Your soul must fly . Even I know . The soul of your son was intended to leave . In another body . A different path . Independent of you , but not forgotten . So you should not feel guilty because you know , both are free . You should bring a little joy . - How are you ? - Okay . Confused . A little surprised . Be afraid . Weakness , inherited from his father . Her father is the man courageous people I know . - Did he go trick ? - No . Not with the others . As I was saying . But I think ... everything will be fine . There is a narrow margin between bravery and stupidity . Thank you . If you want sweet occasionally makes sense show some weakness . And ask for help . - Donna ? - Yes Thank you for today . Some of we could have died . Who knows . I can not say it out loud , but I 'm so glad you 're here . I say the same . I 'm serious . If I say something , Do you promise not to laugh or think I 'm crazy ? Seriously . This is between you and me . Yeah , sure . I have this dream . I do not know why , but it really scares me . In the dream I have ... - ... I 'm pregnant . - Pregnant ? Yes Pregnant far . Floating . Naked . I come here to lock up pressure . I go to watch and see ... I see myself . I 'm out , I work in the propellant . And from behind the planet is a very bright light ? Yes Well . It 's the same dream that I for about two months . This is what happened today . These hallucinations , dreams . This has nothing to do with Halo , right ? No .

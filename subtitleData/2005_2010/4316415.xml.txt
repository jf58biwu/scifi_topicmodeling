 I can see . I can see , David ! - What 's wrong ? - What do you mean ? You 're frightened . - Yeah , actually . - People are talking . They think you 're acting differently . Like you 're ... I don 't know , more sensitive to their emotions . - What is this here ? - I don 't know . - Bob ! - I have to get out of here . This circuit board is from the mainframe at LAX air traffic controls . - It 's covered in some organic slime . - Like a biofilm ? Exactly and it 's all over the circuit board . Thousands of people were caught mid-air . We just narrowly averted a catastrophe . With all this magnetobacteria running around there 's gonna be a panic . Market for raw coltan is gonna skyrocket . Whoever 's sitting on a supply is looking to make a killing . Keep me posted . We need to talk . You know , it 's funny , every time he leaves a NorBAC meeting he 's on a call to you . There 's a numbered company in the Caymans . Carl Riddlemeyer on the take ? If Carl Riddlemeyer is somehow involved with all this magnetobacteria bull , was he involved with the smallpox too ? God bless you . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so ... Hey no . It 's ... Don 't be afraid . - What 's going on ? - Are you okay ? What happened ? They just came around the corner . We were crossing the street . They just ... They swerved right in front of us ! We could have been killed ! Hey , stay back . I can 't breathe ! Give me air ! - Buddy back off ! - Get me out of the car ! - Stay back , okay ! - Miss , it 's okay . Calm down Miss . Bob ! Bob ! Bob ! Bob ! Listen to me ! Come here ! It 's okay , it 's okay ! I 'm okay . I 'm okay . Bob , come on , let 's go . ReGenesis 3x13 Back To The Future Subtitles Team NorBAC Synchro Bbsiocnarf , Dapitch666 , Linwelin , Lovechange Version NoTag 1.0 After over 6 hours of delays had stranded hundreds of passengers . Now , the apparent cause of the shutdown was said to be a problem with the Air Traffic Controller 's computer system , but we 're now learning that the problem might be more widely spread than just the 4 major airports . David 's here . Reports coming in from Hong Kong and Moscow suggest a global phenomenon . Telecommunications systems in both cities have suffered the worst intermittent shutdowns Hey . - You 're sitting in a dark room ... - David , don 't . What 's going on ? I don 't know , David . I had some sort of breakdown - I 'm not sure . - What happened ? There was an accident down the block . I was a part of it . - I could feel things . - What kind of " things " ? Everything all at once . Pounding me with feelings . Emotions . Fears . Like right now . I know you 're both worried . Mayko 's more afraid . Are you worried because you think you might have made a mistake ? I 'm not worried . Yes , you are . Was this happening before we injected you with the herpes virus ? No , not really , I guess . It 's never been this ... overwhelming . Not clear . I could feel something coming on . Tonight was kind of like ... An explosion ? What ? Mayko , I don 't fucking know . Animals give off chemical signals that travel between each other . Pheromones ? You think you might be picking up on pheromones , Bob ? Pregnant women are documented to have a heightened sense of emotions . - I doubt that you 're pregnant . - Of course not , but I 'm just saying ... We 're shutting down the virus . But it 's working . My eyesight in this eye is getting better every day . Well , clearly it 's doing more than just allowing your optic nerve to grow ! - Can 't we give it a little more time ? - Bob . What we 've done here , and the risks we 've taken ... You don 't know if you 're stepping into a puddle or an abyss . 'Scuse me . I think the virus is doing something more to Bob . You 're basing this on ? The virus delivered an siRNA to knock out a particular NT receptor and allows the axons to grow on the trellises . That 's all good . But I think some of the virus traveled in the wrong direction . Up the repaired optic nerve into Bob 's brain and in particular into his Jacobson 's Organ . You can 't be serious . The Vomeronasal Organ has been dormant in humans for millions of years . - You saw all the activity up there . - I don 't see how that 's possible . We know it 's in the brain . Now , Bob is ... He 's sensing stuff . He 's ... - He 's smelling emotions . - Chemosensory development ? - Humans don 't have that . - Well , Bob does . Now , you can call it induced evolution if you want . But it 's happening way too fast . And if we don 't do something , Bob 's either gonna go catatonic or he 's gonna wind up bouncing off the walls in a padded cell . What do you propose ? When we designed the virus , we made it supersensitive to an anti-viral drug . Kind of an Achilles heel . Kill Paul Revere 's horse so the message doesn 't get through . - That 's it . - Okay . Let me sleep on it ? Not too long . I 'm bringing Bob down to New York - tomorrow morning . - Okay , bye . Good night . That 's strange . What 's going on ? We were taking another look at the RNA nano structure . - Still smiling . - Right . So we checked where on the genome the codes were placed . It wasn 't hard . All we had to do was look for the hairpin repeats . Alright , here 's the genomic code for the magnetobacterium . - Right . - And here is the code for the bacteria to create the smiley faces . Okay . I 'll meet you guys in Security , alright ? Bob . You 'll be fine . - Yeah . - See you , Bob . Smiley face . Right . There are two places on the genome that code for the smiley face ? - Yeah . On either end of that sequence . - What does that sequence code for ? Well , here are the BLAST results . No significant similarities reading the DNA . So what is it ? What is it that was put there on purpose ? - That 's what we 're working on . - Well , stay on it . We will . - How is Bob ? - He 's fine . He 's going to be fine . Look , do you prefer to wait in the car ? I 'm fine . At what time are we supposed to leave for New York ? Noon . We 've got plenty of time . But if I avoid it , try not to take it in , I 'm fine . But then I think , why should I avoid it ? I have a gift . It 's not a gift , Bob . It 's a change . But just because it 's a change , it doesn 't mean that it 's bad . It doesn 't mean it 's something I shouldn 't try to understand , to accept . - Don 't you think , Mayko ? - I don 't know , Bob . No , I know , I know . I don 't know . Yes , sir ? I 'd like to see Dr. Turnbull at her earliest convenience . I 'll arrange that . Alright ? - Taxi ! - It 's gonna snow . It 's cold enough . Did I do alright , David ? You did fine , Bob . We 'll know for sure tomorrow morning . - Okay . - Up we go . Alright ? Just watch out , the door 's in front of you , okay ? - You got him , Mayko ? - Yeah . - What ? - Where are you ? New York . - Yeah , so am I. - Creepy . What are you doing ? I 've got something on Northern Sky . What ? It turns out that they 're an Auflander Docheimer Industries investment . And Riddlemeyer was a lobbyist for a sister company . - Small fucking world . - I 've got a meeting set up in an hour . I 'll meet you there . - I 'll catch you guys back in Toronto . - Okay , David . It 's gonna get ugly . Would you at least let me start , please ? David ? Fine , whatever , hit a home run , Wes . You always make people wait an hour before you see them ? We appreciate your time , Mr. Muyerbridge . Absolutely . Let 's cut to the chase , Smiley Face . We know you 're hoarding coltan , or tantalum , or whatever the fuck you want to call it . - I beg your pardon ? - Whose idea was it to wipe out the circuit boards with the magnetobacteria ? - David . - Cost of tantalum goes up ; you unload . How much money are you standing to make ? - Okay . - Sit down ! Who 's behind the smallpox ? - Tell me ! - David ! Tell me the truth , you son of a bitch ! It 's gonna get ugly . Would you at least let me start , please ? David ? Fine , whatever , hit a home run , Wes . Gentlemen . Good to see you , Mr. Muyerbridge . Thank you very much for your time . - Absolutely . - I like my fantasy better . I beg your pardon ? I was just wondering what the market value of tantalum was these days . - David . - I 'm thinking of investing . I was told it 's important in everything from computers to cell phones . I think that should be a meeting with your financial advisor . I was told that this was going to be a meeting about Auflander Docheimer 's involvement with ... something called magnetobacterium - at our lab in Indiana . - It is . And just to be up front and personal , save us the bullshit . I think I can do that . Our investment in Northern Sky was to work on magnetobacteria in an attempt to better extract metals from ore . - Actually , tantalum . - Yes . - To extract tantalum . - From the Boreal Shield ? - Well , to find a better way ... - And the Congo . Look , we have mines in the Boreal Shield , the Congo , Australia . Am I going to be interrupted again ? - Maybe . - No . We were interested in engineering a form of magnetobacterium to bind tantalum , much like gold bonds to mercury . Bacteria would change the chemistry of the tantalum so it could be more easily extracted from the ore . So Auflander Docheimer is investing in a cheaper way to process tantalum ? Safer , cleaner , cheaper . Believe it or not , Dr. Sandström , we are not the bad guys . Really ? Then why haven 't I heard about this vunder gift for mankind ? Because we abandoned the project in May of 2005 . - Couldn 't get the process to work . - Seems like Auflander duck-fucker 's got a lot of those " couldn 't get the process to work " in its closet . We had a few successes . I believe there 's one involving the reparation of the optic nerve . How is that going ? How well do you know Carl Riddlemeyer ? - We 're acquainted . - Acquainted ? He was a lobbyist for the tantalum industry . And pharma and energy and defense . All of which we are acquainted with . - What about Robbie McCain ? Hear of him ? - Who ? What do you know about smallpox ? It 's a very nasty virus . What does this have to do with magnetobacterium ? A smiley face . I 'm sorry ? Look , this isn 't that hard . " Thank you for your time ? " That 's the best you could do ? ! What did you expect ? He answered our questions credibly . - He played us out of the fucking room . - Maybe . - You have to admit he did a good job . - I 'm glad you were impressed . David , he saw us coming . - He had his guns loaded . - He 's in this with Riddlemeyer . Of course he 's in this with Riddlemeyer . They make a great 1 / 2 combination . Riddlemeyer provides the political savvy , Muyerbridge the financial punch . He didn 't know about Robbie McCain , though . No . Or the smiley face . How 'd it go with Bob ? Fine . They should be back in Toronto by now . - Good . - Mayko dig up anything more on Robbie ? Not yet . - This is interesting . - What ? I pulled some strings at the IRS , they 'll look into his numbered company . And ? It 's a transportation company . Shipping and trucking . The kind that could , say , ship 1.3 million kilos of raw coltan out of Africa ? I 'll find out . It 's an environmental lobbyist . - She 's got a gas mask on . - Okay . You smell nice . Thank you . The caption says : " Rest assured , " this government does not have a defeatist attitude " regarding the environment . " That 's good . David 's here . - Hey , David . - Hey . So , how are we doing ? Fine . Good . Good . That 's great . You start to feel some change ? Staying about the same , eh ? Bob , what 's going on ? - I can deal with it , David . - Sure you can . You don 't believe me . The virus was deactivated , okay ? You should be at least leveling off by now . I 'm not . David , don 't be angry or frustrated . Stop , David ! - I am not angry ! - You are . You 're angry at me . Not at you . - Maybe the anti-viral just didn 't ... - It fucking worked , Mayko ! David , he 's more connected than ever . - He can 't be ! - David ! Why don 't you stop this anger ? Because nothing makes sense . 'Cause I don 't know what the fuck is going on ! Alright , I 'm sorry , Bob , alright ? Okay , I 'm just ... Sorry . You didn 't do anything wrong . " Two electronic companies announced today that they 're ... " recalling ... " over 200,000 MP3 players . " It 'll be alright . I know , Bob . " The recall affects all computers sold after June 1st ... " - Why do you think you 're wrong ? - I analyzed the DNA sequence between the smiley faces and it keeps coming up junk . The closest I got to anything was this . These three regions that might be code for a protein . Can you break out these regions into codons ? Sure . Okay ... What amino acids are we looking at here ? ATG is Methionine . GAA is Glutamic acid . What are you thinking ? I don 't know . - Can you give me a print out of this ? - Sure . Tryptophan . - Keep kicking it around . - I will . Haven 't found anything that kills it yet . So what are we doing ? What are you doing here ? I 'm here to get an update on the magnetobacteria contamination . Who sent you ? Almost every major electronics manufacturer in North America . - Really . What 's their problem ? - Have you been watching the news ? Or maybe you 're too busy harassing multi-billion dollar techno-conglomerates ? I heard about your little visit to Auflander Docheimer . Hope you found the answers you were looking for . Why don 't we just jump to what the hell do you want ? A million computer batteries are being recalled . They 're heating up , could explode . That 's interesting . ' Cause what ... With about 2 ounces of tantalum each , it 'll take a lot of tantalum to replace them all . 750,000 PCs are also being recalled . One manufacturer isn 't even shipping out his new laptop line because of a microprocessor failure . They want to know if it 's the magnetobacteria ? A little insight into the problem would be helpful . Trade you some insight for some insight . - Not interested in playing games . - Me neither . Alright . What do you want to know ? Auflander Docheimer , Robbie McCain , smallpox and magnetobacteria . - How are they connected ? - Haven 't got a clue . Now , are we under biological attack ? Are magnetobacteria controllable ? - Who 's behind it ? - Haven 't got a clue . Maybe " yes " to biological attack . What are we doing ? Did you bug my office ? If this is related in any way to the contamination , I would like to know what we 're doing . Did you know that Robbie McCain was gonna get gunned down ? We 've been through that . We found this DNA sequence between two smiley faces - on the magnetobacteria genome . - What does that mean ? Shoot . I thought you could tell me . These little groups of letters are the codes to amino acids . For example , ATG , that 's Methionine . We just write an M because we 're lazy . GAA is glutamic acid . It 's E. TGG , that 's ... tryptophan . That 's a W. You and Muyerbridge are gonna make a killing on this tantalum scam . - What ? - I 'm sure as Science Czar you already know all this . But amino acids , when they get together , they make up a protein . Right ? But I don 't see any of these amino acids getting together to make any kind of protein I 've ever seen . So I 'm asking myself ... Why would you put ... two smiley faces ... in the entire sequence ... with all these nucleotides in between ? Actually , I 'm asking you . How would I know ? Holy fuck . What ? - Got a lot of work to do . You gotta go . - What just happened ? Send us a couple of MP3 players - and some batteries . We 'll have a look . - They 're already en route . - We let you know if we find anything . - Thank you . Carlos , Rachel . My office . Yeah ? Yeah , I 'm sorry I couldn 't be on the flight with you . No , I 'm not in D.C. Listen , I think we should get out of this arrangement . Why ? Because I don 't like it , that 's why . It doesn 't feel right . Yeah , I think we need to talk . I appreciate it . These are the symbols for the amino acids between the smiley faces . Do you see it ? Hi , David , kill me with ... Chiv gas . CHIV . CH4 . Methane gas . Someone encoded a personal note to you on how to kill it . It 's the contact with the smiley face people missing from the equation . Yeah . Let 's see if they mean what they say . So , what have you got ? - The right ones have been treated . - It worked . - At least we know how to kill it . - Yeah , we sprayed every circuit , capacitor , transistor with methane . This is playing out just like the smallpox . It 's potentially devastating unless you figure out their little puzzle . But what 's their point ? What do they want this time ? Titus Muyerbridge is dead ? All they know is that the pilot reported instrument failure 5 min. after takeoff . He tried to turn the plane around , get back to White Plains but never made it . Any chance this couldn 't be an accident ? Initial reports say instrument failure . As in short-circuited control panel instrument failure ? As in somebody doesn 't want Muyerbridge around anymore ? Who that could be ? Maybe there 's a bigger fish in this pond of shit . Maybe he had a partner who didn 't like the way things were going . Maybe someone who didn 't like what Muyerbridge was up to . If we can find out who that is , we 'll know a hell of a lot more . What ? Oh hey , Dr. Turnbull . I double-checked your anti-viral . The cells I took from Dr. Melnikov 's eyes after the injection - definitely have no viral replication . - Well , then how is it ... And there 's no other damage . It worked perfectly . - Then why is he still progressing ? - What do you mean ? I think the brakes are off on his Jacobson 's Organ . Well , it 's not because of your virus . It 's dead . Well then , it 's ... What ? Shit , it 's in his genes . Somehow the , the virus must have ... changed the DNA in the dormant genes that are associated with his Jacobson 's Organ . It 's growing again . Viral activation of dormant genes ? Well , that , that would mean that Dr. Melnikov has genetically evolved into ... - a higher state of being . - A part of his brain is waking up . Who knows what it 's evolving into ? Well , If that 's the case , I want you to bring him so we can do some more tests . The only test left would involve brain surgery . We look at the stem cells in the area of the brain that 's lighting up . We need to examine him to know for sure . How is Muyerbridge 's death gonna affect your funding ? Sorry ? Titus Muyerbridge . The plane crash . With him gone , I mean , are you in danger of losing the funding for your work ? No , Mr. Roth has personally assured me that our funding is stable . - Who ? - Olivier Roth . Founder of ADI . I see . Alright , you know what , I 'll get back to you . Hi , sorry to call so late . It 's about Dr. Melnikov ... I think something interesting is developing . Hello ? What do you want ? Why are you watching me ? I know . I know you 're not gonna hurt me . Just ... just go , please . Why are you doing that ? Why are just looking at me ? What do you want ? I 'd like you to come with me , Bob . Would you be willing to do that ? - Where are we going ? - I have a plane waiting . It 's better we get there before I explain . Please ... Come with me . It 'll be alright . I want you to trust me . Do you understand that ? Yes . What ? I 'll be right there . - He cut off his bandages and he left . - It 's gonna be okay . Why the fuck did I leave him alone ? David , he said he wanted Chinese . - And he said he ... - It 's gonna be okay . Maybe he just freaked out again . Maybe he just overloaded and ... He would never do that . No matter how upset he got , - he wouldn 't want to upset you . - But why would he just up and leave ? Maybe he didn 't just up and leave . Maybe somebody took him . Let 's get back to the lab . Bob ... Look , just call me back as soon as you get this message , okay ? Fuck ! He 's not in his apartment . Doesn 't look like he 's been there all night . He 's not back at the loft . He 's not answering his cell . God . - What about the police ? - They have a description . They also know the situation . Same with immigration and customs . Not a word , not a note . Something stinks here . You still think somebody took him ? - I think Ann Turnbull took him . - Ann Turnbull ? She doesn 't even fit the profile of a kidnapper , David . No , but the company that funds her research does . Auflander Docheimer Industries ? For all intents and purposes does not exist as of the close of the markets yesterday . - What are you talking about ? - They 've pulled their funding for RD . - They 're restructuring . - That 's not possible . Turnbull told me that some guy called Roth already gave her the okay for her work with Bob . Doctor Turnbull , David Sandström . Call me ! It 's urgent ! Did you just say Roth ? He 's , like , Auflander Docheimer 's founding father or some shit . Robbie McCain 's wife , Leslie . Her maiden name 's Roth . Give me 5 minutes . - David ? - You got something for me ? Muyerbridge , the jet ... Magnetobacteria all over it . And there 's something else . - Nowhere . Not one smiley face . - And methane doesn 't kill it . You hear that ? The other shoe dropping . No shit . Excuse me . So ? Leslie Roth . Her father is Olivier Roth . More or less dropped off the map 5 months ago . Daddy 's little girl dies in one of his labs then his son-in-law gets shot . Been a rough couple of months . But what does he have to do with this ? What does he want with Bob ? That was Carl . He wants to meet . Wes ! The president wants to talk to him . - Carl 's gonna wear this tantalum scam ? - He sounded scared . I 'd be scared too if I thought the president was after my ass . - No , it was something else . - What ? He wouldn 't say on the phone . Thanks for coming . Rachel . - Carl . - Where 's Bob , fuckhead ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You 'd better tell me the fucking truth ! I am . I don 't know what you 're talking about . What are we doing here , Carl ? I heard the Auflander Docheimer jet went down . I need to know . Was it sabotage ? It was the magnetobacteria , if that 's what you mean . How it got on board , we thought you could tell us . I had nothing to do with magnetobacteria . Sure . After all the time we 've spent together , the lying , the manipulation , we believe you . I knew you were gonna be a thorn in my ass from the day we met . I wanted to bury you . - What made you change your mind now ? - He saw an opportunity . Didn 't you ? So you wormed your way in like a fucking parasite . An opportunity here , an investment there . Like smuggling raw coltan out of Africa to refine it into tantalum later ? Titus Muyerbridge offered me an opportunity to invest in a precious metal . I gave him a shipping opportunity through a company I used to lobby for . That 's all . You cleared records at the State Department . Yeah , alright . I might have done some paper shuffling . And the smallpox ? I don 't know . The smallpox , magnetobacteria . - I don 't know about that . - What about Muyerbridge ? I don 't think he knew about them either . He never said anything to me . Why should we believe you anymore , Carl ? Why ? Because I was supposed to be on that plane with Muyerbridge . Someone wanted to take me out too . - Do you know Olivier Roth ? - Of course I do . I never met him , but in the financial circles he was with Buffet and Gates . Well , I think he 's responsible for the smallpox , the magnetobacteria , and I think he 's kidnapped Bob . - So tell us where we can find him ? - I don 't know . I wish I could help you . I really do . I don 't know . Fuckin ' waste of time . I think you 'll find it much more comfortable in here . Sit . Please . Is this better ? Yes , thank you . You 've been very kind to indulge me , Dr. Melnikov . I 'm sure you 're anxious to get back to Toronto . It 's just that some people might be worried about me . But I do appreciate you bringing me here to see Dr. Turnbull . She 's very impressed with you . Bob , before I take you back to Toronto I wanted to share something with you . My daughter was a scientist . Leslie McCain . At Greenway Labs , I remember . - It was terrible what happened there . - It was a senseless accident . - It shouldn 't have happened . - I 'm sorry . I thought all my money , all the scientists it bought , could make humanity better off . There were 3 million AIDS deaths this year . Not enough drugs to go around because patents prevented countries in Asia and Africa from providing people with cheaper , generic AIDS drugs . Change the channel . That was General Mark Kimmitt 's advice to Iraqis who see TV images of innocent people killed by coalition troops . Exxon has the hubris to report the highest profit in the history of corporate America ! I did not recognize that the fundamental problem is humanity itself . We are controlled by the greed of others . We no longer understand who that person is in the mirror , let alone that child starving to death in his mother 's arms on the other side of the world . And that 's why I 'm here . You are everything Dr. Turnbull has said you are . I would like to help you . We have a chance to start over . Stop the race for higher profits . Stop the technology that 's taking this planet apart ! Stop it now in one screaming short-circuit of rebirth . Don 't you think it 's fitting that we take a moment to understand ? To relate . To reflect on the knowledge we have formulated . I understand . The world will stop and the reflection begins . We will change humanity , evolve the species . With my DNA . You , Dr. Melnikov , encompass the only hope we have left . A man who truly understands the compassion , the hopes , the fears of his fellow man . Within you , in a stem cell in your brain , lies the future of mankind . Nobody knows where she is ? We checked every inch of Visionsight and the apartment . Nothing . What about Auflander Docheimer ? I 'm there now . The doors are closed . I 'm waiting on a search warrant . - Break the fucking doors down , Wes ! - David , I can 't exactly do that ! Dammit ! Fuck you . What ? - Hello , David . - Bob ! Bob , where the fuck are you ? I 've got every cop in Toronto looking for you . I 'm alright . I won 't be into work . Where are you ? David , I believe I 've found someone who can help us . Help us ? The world , David . It won 't be the same anymore . Is he there with you now ? Olivier Roth has the answer , David . I wanna talk to him . With the stem cells from my brain from my Jacobson 's Organ we have the seeds of a new generation . I want to talk to him , Bob ! Okay . Goodbye , David . What ? I feel very privileged to speak to you , Dr. Sandström . Roth , look ... Whatever you 're planning , whatever you 've done , we 've got to talk about it . I 've tried to talk , through my son-in-law , through all the messages I 've sent you . And I 've tried to listen . I am listening . The science you 're doing is amazing . We should really get together . What I 'm doing is taking the tools that you have given me and building a better world . What I have given you is an accident . Okay , it 's a miscalculation . Most experts agree the way the world will end will be an accident . Maybe what you gave me was prophetic . No , no , no , it 's a mistake ! The world as it is now is a mistake . A giant mistake . Listen to me , Roth , you-son-of-a-bitch . If you do anything to Bob I will find you , I 'll rip your fucking head off ! See you in the future , David . Roth ? ! Bob . You ready , Bob ? Yes .

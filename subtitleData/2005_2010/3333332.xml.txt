 Hey ! That 's a great punch . Fear no good . So emotion and control . Breathe . Breathe . Wait . Okay . I can make it work for a while , but you need ... Okay . Okay . Shut that off ! Turn it off ! Watch out ! Okay ! That 's not right . Oh , you . You see that ? See that ? My ticket out of here . Damn it ! Here 's something a bit more interesting . It 's a possible gamma sickness . Milwaukee . A man drank one of those guarana sodas . Guess it had a little more kick than he was looking for . Wow . - Where was it bottled ? - Porto Verde , Brazil . Have our people look for a white man at the bottling plant . Tell them no contact ! If he even sees them , he 's gone ! I got you who I could . Short notice , but they 're all quality . And I pulled you one ace . Emil Blonsky . Born in Russia , raised in England . And on loan to SOCOM from the Royal Marines . I know you cashed in some chips for this , Joe . Glad I could help . Just make it good . This is the target and the location . Snatch and grab , live capture . You 'll have your dart clips and suppression ordnance , but live fire is for backup only . We got local out there , but we want it tight and quiet . Is he a fighter ? Your target is a fugitive from the US government who stole military secrets . He is also implicated in the deaths of two scientists , a military officer , an Idaho state trooper and possibly two Canadian hunters . So don 't wait to see if he 's a fighter ! Tranq him and bring him back . Oh , come on . Camera . Here we go . Get rid of the damn dog . Take him ! Target 's on the move . Where is he ? He 's on the ground . - Let 's go ! Go ! Move , move ! Go , go , go ! Go ! Go ! Clear everyone out ! Do not lose him ! Oh ! No ! Get around behind him ! Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0 . Oh , no . You got to be kidding me . Where is he ? - Target acquired . Gringo ! Let 's go . No ! Please ! No ! Not the computer ! Gimme that ! No ! You bad angry , G ? I very bad angry . Oh , no . You don 't understand ! Something really bad is about to happen here ! Anybody else seeing this ? We 've got a bogey of some kind . Please advice . That is the target ! Use every tranq you 've got ! Do it now ! Go live ! Go live ! Go live ! Move ! Get out of the way ! No ! It 's behind us ! Move ! Move ! Get him ! Shoot ! Leave me alone . No ! No ! I knew something was different before I got the shot off . He had it on him when he bolted . Is that a girlfriend ? She helps him , maybe ? She is no longer a factor . We closed that door to him a long time ago . He 's alone . He wants to be alone . But see if he 's been talking to anybody . Forgive me , sir ? Doesn 't anybody want to talk about what went down in there ? ' Cause ... He didn 't lose us . And he was not alone , sir . We had him . And then something hit us , something ... Something big hit us ! It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball ! It was the most powerful thing I 've ever seen . Well , it 's gone . Well , if Banner knows what it is , I 'm gonna track him down , I 'm gonna put my foot on his throat - and I 'm gonna ... - That was Banner . It was Banner . - You have to explain that statement , sir . - No , I don 't . You 've done a good job . Pack up and get our men on a plane . We 're going home . Wait . Please . Where am I ? I 've run into bad situations on crap missions before . I 've seen good men go down purely because someone didn 't let us know what we were walking into . I 've moved on to the next one , because that 's what we do , right ? I mean , that 's the job . But this ? This is a whole new level of weird . And I don 't feel inclined to step away from it . So if you 're taking another crack at him , I want in . And , with respect , you should be looking for a team that 's prepped and ready to fight , because if that thing shows up again , you 're gonna have a lot of professional tough guys pissing in their pants . Sir . Tienes m√°s stretchy ? Yeah . Perfecto . Let me emphasise that what I 'm about to share with you is tremendously sensitive , both to me personally and the Army . You 're aware that we 've got an Infantry Weapons Development programme . Well , in WWII , they initiated a subprogram for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement . Yeah , Super Soldier . Yes . An oversimplification , but yes . And I dusted it off , got ' em doing serious work again , bold work . Across the hall , they were trying to arm you better . We were tryin ' to make you better . Banner 's work was very early phase . It wasn 't even weapons application . He thought he was working on radiation resistance . I would never have told him what the project really was . But he was so sure of what he was onto , that he tested it on himself . And something went very wrong . Or it went very right . As far as I 'm concerned , that man 's whole body is the property of the US Army . You said he wasn 't working on weapons , right ? - No . - But you were . You were , weren 't you ? You were trying other things . One serum we developed was very promising . - So why did he run ? - He 's a scientist . He is not one of us . - Blonsky , how old are you ? 45 ? - 39 . - It takes a toll , doesn 't it ? - Yes , it does . So get out of the trenches . You should be a Colonel by now , with your record . No , I 'm a fighter . I 'll be one for as long as I can . You know , if I could take what I know now , put it in the body I had ten years ago , that would be someone I wouldn 't want to fight . I could probably arrange something like that . Take care , kids . Stan , I give you my word , whatever you 've heard about me , it 's not true . Oh , I know it . I always knew it . I mean , you know how I felt about you two . - Have you talked to her ? - No . She doesn 't know that I 'm here . - She 's with somebody ? - Yeah , he 's a head shrink . They say he 's one of the best . But a really nice guy . Good . That 's good . - Bruce , what can I do to help you ? - I could use a bed for a few nights . - You can have the spare room upstairs . - That 'd be so great . There is one other thing . Excuse me . Pardon me . Coming through . Hey , pal . I got a delivery on five . I don 't think there 's anybody up there . Oh , man . I 'm gonna catch hell if I don 't collect . You got to let me try . I 'll tell you what . I got an extra medium . Take it on the house . - You are the man . - God bless you , brother . All right . Okay . We 're pretty well closed here , folks . I 'm sorry . Oh , come on , Stan . It 's Friday night . Oh , kids . I got nothing but marinara now . Oh , I got to have a Mister Pink , please . She worked through dinner again , of course . Stan ? And he ... I go , " So , yeah , I mean , where were you ? " I can 't ... I don 't know where you were , Cecil . " And he goes , " Not where you been at . " I thought , " Oh , my God . " I just felt so awful . Bruce ? Betty ? What 's going on ? Betty ... Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw . - I don 't know what to say . - Please , just tell me the truth . Don 't go . Don 't go . I want you to come with me now . Please . Come with me . Please . It 's our data . I got in there before they carted it all away . I hoped somewhere that it might tell us something someday . - Does the General know that you have this ? - No , I don 't think so . I haven 't spoken to him in a couple of years . You have to be sure . Bruce , I don 't understand why we can 't just go in there together and talk to him . He told me what he wanted to do . He wants it out of me . He wants to dissect it so that he can replicate it . He wants to make it a weapon . - Hi . - Hi . - I thought you might want to ... - Thanks . Listen , I should leave early , as early as I can . Really ? You can 't stay at all ? I want to , but it 's just not safe for me to be here . - lf I could borrow some cash ... - Of course . I need to take a bus . Well , at least let me walk you to the station . Okay . - You have everything you need ? - Yeah . I ... What ? - Good night . - Good night . I hope you get some rest . We 're giving you a very low dose only . I need you sharp out there and disciplined . First sign of any side effect , we stop and you 're off team until you straighten out . - Agreed ? - Agreed . You 'll get two separate infusions . One into the deep muscle , one into the bone marrow centres . The bone ones are going to hurt . Is everything okay ? I think so . Come here . - I just wanna do this . - Oh . - It 's better like that . - Yeah ? It feels too tight , huh ? - Yeah , a little . - Okay . - What ? - They 're here . - Betty , look at me , look at me ! - Bruce ! You have to go far away from me as you can ! - Don 't argue with me , just go . Go ! - Bruce ! Damn it ! We 'd have had snipers on target in three more minutes . I wanna know who jumped the gun . He 's heading 2-7-0 . Blonsky ! Not yet ! Sir . Look alive . This could get interesting . I got him ! Stop ! Stop ! I know you 're in there ! General , please ! Sir ? Dad ! - Dad , please don 't do this . - You can 't see this clearly . Now , get inside . There he is ! Target is in the overpass . We have a visual . Do not engage ! Repeat , do not engage ! He 's locked in . Put two canisters in there with him . Fire ! Get her back here ! Now she 'll see . Alpha team ? Let him have all of it . Come on , light him up ! Where are the fifty cals ? Move your asses ! Oh , my God ! Blonsky , now you 're up ! Sir ? Cover me . Remember me ? My God , he 's doing it . Move him toward the cannons ! Move ! Hold your position ! Do it now ! Please , please , please , no ! - Please , please , please ! - Get her back ! You 're killing him ! Stop ! Get off of me ! Bruce ! Bruce ! Where 's the gunship ?

It feels like Hell 's doorstep . Miss Miyuki . Miss Miyuki . Miss Miyuki ! Are you all right ? Where are we ? Apparently we fell back to the surface . Apparently we what ? We overshot Mooneyes and were on an orbit to circle the moon when that giant hand ... didn 't you ? And that giant ? So this must be ... Yes . Miyuki . You okay ... ? A giant ? Look ! What 's this ? ! I didn 't think they could possibly be real either . huh ? I thought that was just a fairy tale . On the moon live the descendants of the giants who once created the heavens . that . My mom told me the story when I was little . And the moon giants are starfarers too ... Starfarers ? that 's a tasty-sounding name ! the gods created the world . and the scars of their struggle became the cornerstones of civilization . It is said that the first people to play sports with a ball did so in memory of that battle long ago . and a prodigious player appeared whose skills rivaled the gods ' . and saved both Earthdash and the moon in their hour of need . He was revered as a legend . That 's pretty much how the story I know goes . A thunderbolt ball ? and the path it traced was the shape of the heavens ' creation . Huh ? What ? It 's been bugging me . Why did James and his group deliberately seek us out ? and even hold championships ? For the money and ... something more ? Yes . the moon is searching for someone who can really hurl thunderbolt balls . And that 's ... What 's that ? Iceman ! This is the place I least wanted to remember . was once deluded by the legend . and this leg . Now the shards of my dream lie deep within the earth . Iceman ... This arm aches . This leg won 't be quiet . You ... you 're not like me . You 'll do it ... You 'll become the true legend . Destroy ! Iceman ... he still works ! Got it ! Iceman ! My Zephyr ... I bet I can do something . Leave it to me ! Please ! Whew ! Huh ? don 't ! How was the launch ? A pleasure to meet you . her companion . didn 't you ? I knew . Nice ! doesn 't she ? no ! We all have our reasons . Miss Sela ... I 'll handle the repairs ! Oh ... Thanks . You 're not like me . Duh ! You and me are different ! Iceman ! Wrong side up ! Ow ... What the hell ? ! Dan ! Who are you guys ? Ow ! Welcome to endsville . { Or shitsville . Whichever u think fits better szzzt } Where 'd you come from ? Where ? Don 't you — ? We came from up there ! Where is this place ? This is the abyss : Underground . Underground ? Those with nowhere to go end up here . The town that is rock bottom . for a time . all of you ! No ! Stop ! Please stop ! I don 't want to die ! Stop ! To be chosen is both a disaster and a blessing . It 's the first barrier you must overcome if you wish to crawl back up to the light . That was quick ! sniff . That 's the smell of blood . Let 's see ... This can serve for that and the other ... And there 's still ... This ! Let go ! You let go ! I want the transforming screw from this ! I want the mounting ! Oh ! give you the screw and me the mounting ! Just a — ! no time to waste ! Come where ? ! You 're lucky ! So lucky ! H-Hey ! What are you — ? ! Let go ! you — ? ! what — Let me go ! You 're lucky . Ow ... if you want to stay alive ! There are weapons over there . Wh-What ? ! Kill him ! Kill him ! Kill him ! Fight ! There are your weapons ! If it 's a weapon I need ... of course ! You moron ! What are you doing ? ! Pick up a weapon ! there 's plenty ! There 's no drills or planes I want ! " He seems to be talking about woodworking tools . Perhaps it 's a figure for not wanting a tool with a point or an edge . } Kill him ! Kill him ! Kill him ! Who did that ? No interference ! Basquash ! There . How about this ? ! The winner gives death to the loser ! Kill him ! Kill him ! Kill him ! They want you to kill him . H-Hey ! You 're really gonna do it ? You gonna kill him ? Hey ! You dumbasses ! I can 't basquat if I kill him ! Dammit ! There 's no killing in basketball ! They 're nuts ! It 's that basketball jerk . That 's a pretty good price . I heard they kept up the chase ' til he went to Dead Bottom . Shit ! The lowest level ? Here you go . Would you fellows mind telling me more ? Good work . Thank you . You 're pretty popular . For a cute boy ! The kinky impression is very good . Don 't stare at me ! Yep ! That 's what appeals to them ! I can 't believe men like this sort of thing ! gender has no bearing on beauty ! Artists down through the ages have all — Jiiya ! Be quiet while I 'm working ! Pardon me . we have one stage left to go ! No relaxing yet ! Okay ! Apparently Dan made it to a place called Dead Bottom . Bottom ? we 'll go there too . we gather information . All right . though . Who would have thought the franchise had expanded here ? There 's human industry for you . but we have a location on the moon too . Did you find your handsome man ? Nope . Still ... It 's quite something that you 're a teammate of Iceman 's . well . He always used to drink right here at the bar . Said he liked the name of the place . Three in the Key ... The 3-second rule . And then he lost his arm and leg . all of you ! you basketball jerk ! Huh ? He seems a little different . The only thing that matches is the basketball ! Wrong guy . My name is Iceman Hotty . Iceman Hotty ? Scream my name . And spread the word that Iceman Hotty has returned to Underground ! Destroy ! thanks for waiting . Thank you ! though . Is it for a Bigfoot control interface or something ? Huh ? I mean a mecha undergoing repairs . Is that for its controller or something ? right ? Can I call you my older sister ? ! Call me Thousand . You ? I never said . I 'm Miyuki . Miyuki Ayukawa . Ayukawa ... What ? so that 's it ! I get it . Get out . Get out . Thousand ? I hate you . Just get out ! Dan ! There 's a road on the other side . tasty smell is calling me . Excellent ! I doubt they 'll chase us all the way down here . It 's pretty amazing we got down here . That 's Basquash . Only someone basquatting could come down that slope . That looks like a slope to you ? why are we in this mess again ? Like I know ! the best we can do is get outside and meet up with Miyuki and the rest ... Now this is unusual . General Manager Yan . A boy fell here from the surface . You want me to kill him ? I doubt he 'll die . I can kill legends . You know him ? He 's a lucky boy . He was last seen heading toward Dead Bottom from the underground river . Can you get there ? Who do you think I am ? I 'm Price . I 'm the price of Hell . Dan ! you 're loud ... One of your relatives ? I don 't believe in cannibalism . A ball ? Look at that ! Who 's that ? What 're you gonna do ? Right now I 've got a ball ! Dan JD ! What on Earth are Dan and Iceman up to ? They 're both excellent Basquashers . They 'll be fine . I really have no luck with men .

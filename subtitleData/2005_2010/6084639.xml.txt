 Over the past 60 years 4400 people abducted . They all came back at once . She did not know where they had been . They have become not aged a day . And some have new gifts . They try the thread of their life interrupted to pick up again . We are not a threat , but a blessing . The world must learn to live with us . What went before : You should tell Shawn that he can not leave me . Isabelle does not give up without a fight . I do not want this relationship over is . So that does not happen . I have not always been there for you ... but we still have a good relationship ? Yes , but growing up with a father ... who works for the FBI and NTAC is pretty intense , you know ? I did , you had to say . Do not overdo it . You betrayed me . Ryland death of 284 400 's on his conscience . 28 people who benefit the world could change . Alana will be prosecuted as each member of the NOVA group . You 're one of the few good people here . I will find a way to get you back . Hi , Erika . Stay away from me . - I will not hurt you .

Uncle Patrick 's . Tom Baldwin ? You must sign here . What is it ? - Sorry , I 'm not psychic . This is not dinner . Take care . Diana . Baldwin . Jarvis said it was suicide . Why are we called ? I do not know . Someone from Narcotics NTAC wanted it . Anyway , thanks again for those cookies . That was thoughtful . Cookies ? - The basket that had sent you . Why are you looking ? I have not sent . I just wanted to thank you . For what ? I also had a basket of cookies . Yours . At least , that was on the card . - I have sent you nothing . Are you from NTAC ? Matt Ruddy , Narcotics . Come on . This will captivate you guys . Erika Lundgren . The third suicide in two weeks . Why examines Narcotics suicides ? We suspect a connection . The past six weeks we were reports of a new drug . It 's called Blink . We have hand managed to obtain a sample . But what does that have to do with us ? - The sample is analyzed . One of the components they had never seen before . It appears to resemble what the 4400 's saw . Promicin or so . So you think Blink created by a 4400 ? That 's why I called you . If it is a 4400 ... you can help identify him . Absolutely . Then we have to Learn more about this drug . We actually know only it 's a strong hallucinogen . How do you know Erika Lundgren Blink used ? Of her roommate . Erika morning Blink used . Shortly after she said she saw her uncle . She was freaking out . That guy still humming 12 years . How she came to the drug ? Erika wanted to be as high , she went to an old school friend . Apparently . Now that 's dealing I know not whether they worked also as arrived ... but his name is Greg . Usually he is in Cowen Park to find . He always has his old school jack . Erika said that he used an athletic hero or something . Tony , catch her briefly . We have to look at Cowen Park watch Greg get his Blink . Hello , Tommy . Dad ? Tommy , you 're middle of the street . Watch out . Tom , what are you doing ? Come . What is going on ? The guy told Narcotics Blink that caused hallucinations ? Yes , why ? I think I just saw my father . He just stood there . Tom , your father is dead nine years . Exactly . It was stuck in those cookies . - Why would someone drugging you ? I know it . A bitter 4400 . Someone who hates NTAC . But I 've also eaten some biscuit and I see no dead relatives . Tom , you 've been under a lot of pressure . And this talk about hallucinations ... Your mind keeps you fooling . Maybe . To be sure I better drive . Where do you want to talk about ? Diana , do you see him ? - Who ? My father . He sits there . - I do not see anything . No one sees me . I am only for you . Shut up , you 're not real . - Listen , there 's really no one . Real or not real , I 'm there . And you can not ignore me . What do you want , Dad ? - It 's what you want . You have brought me here . You want to tell me something solid . I have to sign anything . - Tom , listen . There 's nobody there . Try to calm down . Yes , Diana . He ... He 's gone . But he was there , really . We go along NTAC Medical , okay ? It 's all good . That was nice . See ? Everything is still good . I 'm glad you came back . Isabelle . Not right now , okay ? I have things to do . - It can wait . This time I let you think I am another , if you want . Someone whom you have fantasized . I can move the earth . Literally . Isabelle , you do not gift use to seduce me . You 're so nice enough . I just have to go . - In the past you never went so fast . We have lost something , huh ? We still fit together , but it is not the same , is it ? Indeed . But we pretend that nothing has changed . Well , I pretend . And how do you like that ? Not super . I know what to do . Beautiful . I 'm glad you realize it . We should get married . Only then can we be sure that we will never lose each other . You go do your thing but , then I draw up the guest list . The CAT scans were in order , if your blood pressure on the high side . Furthermore , all your stable functions . There were drugs in his system ? The toxicological screening did nothing to ... but we know too little Blink off . You get a sedative , more we can do . So I can leave ? I have my dad not seen six hours . Normally it takes 48 hours for such psychotropic your body is out . But now you do not know how long it takes . Or how severe it is . Hallucinogens work for everyone else . It depends on what problems you unconsciously sitting . I let Garrity give you a lift . You take a few days off . - No , I feel good . You 've also eaten those cookies . So you get both medical leave . I talked to your dad . We wanted to talk with you . I do not know if you mean it with that proposal ... but we must nip in the bud . Marriage is not a good idea . You are too young , I can not allow it . I 'm your father and I tell you : it does not happen . I agree with him . I do not work in this scheme . I understand you guys . There are millions Reasons not to marry . But more reasons to be to marry . Do not you think ... that this relationship is destined ? Shawn and I had together meet ? Love to be ? Isabelle , I do not love you . You and I are two of the most powerful people in the world . We belong together . Furthermore , no one good enough . He says he does not want just downright married . Clearly can not . You must accept it . I have nothing . You have your way of thinking . Try to see it as an arranged marriage . The future wants us to be together . We 'll be together . I 'll make sure . Are you sure you 'll be okay ? I can stay with you . No , I 'm fine . With a little happiness is all that stuff worked . Call me if you need anything . - I will . Good night . Take me home , Garrity . Josh ? - Good to see you . You look different . You look exactly the same . What are you doing here ? - We need to discuss some things . I do not think so . We have not spoken in eleven years . For me it remains so . - That 's hard , is not it ? We have been through a lot . No , you 've done me a lot . That is something else . Are you okay ? It seemed as if you were talking to yourself . No , it 's not . I also Blink dose ingested . Really ? Who did you see ? Nobody . Someone I used to know . Were you engaged ? - Yes , in college . Josh Sandler was AIO , we had something three years . Sorry , I attack you so bad . You never said anything about it . - I do not like to talk about . I would not be jealous of a hallucination ... but you must think much of him . Tom sees his father , that makes sense . Your father is always deeply buried in your psyche . Erika Lundgren saw her uncle , who knows what they did with that . Josh and I have indeed a past , and it was not fine . Ten days before the wedding were we fight and we blew the whole thing off . It was no fun . - You wanna talk about ? Talk about Josh Sandler is the last thing I want . Listen , I 'm exhausted . I want a shower and my bed . Want some company ? Not tonight . I 'll call you in the morning . The whole house to yourself , I see . However , plenty of room for a man . Now that Alana 's gone , you should the whole thing might only sell . Find an apartment . Thanks for the tip , Dad . But it suits me fine here . You still hopes that your son comes home . I do not think that will happen . Do not get angry . I try to hold a conversation . All you say nothing at all . I would not know where to start . Pick a topic . Good . Than my childhood . I hated it when you were there . You were mean to mommy . You drank . You should hate you work , that I could be. no agent When I went to the FBI , you have never called me or congratulations . You were too busy being jealous on your own child . I 'm really talking to myself . Do you feel better now ? Come on , Tommy . You 're a grown man . I did not think you would feel such anger . Father ... You know how hard it is . Take you and Kyle now . He is in the bin and he wants you not even see . Kyle takes time and give I him . Respect , they call it . I 've always been there for him . I did not love you . - I was not a good father . I tried to be there for you and Susan . Understanding you will not find here . Do me a favor and just go away . That does not happen . - Also good . Then I 'll go myself . You can not walk away from me , mate . So easy you do not get rid of me . I 'll make you go away . I the 4400 search that do this to me . And then I force him to stop . - Are you going to work ? I 'll go . I 'm going to do any research with my dead dad . You do not really have a choice , Tom . Or I go along , or we chat within just continue . Also good . But not just dive in ... when I 'm talking to someone . No problem . I have long no research done . It 'll be fun . In the evening you so take still a bowl of ice . Josh , I want you to leave . Stay out of my life . It 's funny . You only ate ice if everyone had gone to bed . I always wondered what that said about you . You 'll nevertheless once need to talk to me . No . You 're just a hallucination . So I you just have to ignore ... then you go away on their own . A good plan . But I do not think it will work . I 'm here for a reason , Diana , that must be . It is random . Josh Sandler is not even dead . I Googled him . He teaches astronomy at Ponoma College . Yes , and ? That 's Josh Sandler from now . You mess with me , your ex-fiance . I have no problems . Mom , are you okay ? I heard something . It 's all right , sweetheart . I 'm just practicing for my work . Come , go back to bed . Were you engaged ? - Why does not anybody believe that ? That 's not it . But you have never said anything about it . It was long ago . It did not work . I 'm glad you called . It 's scary , such drug in your body already claimed three lives . And those hallucinations . So far , it does not appear to experienced what Erika Lundgren . My father just want to talk . - I know . Josh has not threatened me . As long as this continues , we can Just continue with the investigation . If we can discover where those cookies come ... we find that 4400 maybe . And Cowen Park . That dealer does not know he is wanted . I go to the park , then you do the courier . Anything is better than waiting pops to my ex again . Devon , these are all messages this morning . Everyone wants to congratulate you on your engagement . Would you answer them ? - No , I want no one to speak . Even your mother ? She is in the waiting . Yes . Thanks , Devon . Hi , Mom . Mom , who has said that I 'm engaged ? No , I 'm coming . Mom , where are you ? A naughty boy so . - Look at that little face again . What cute . Look at those eyes . Look at that ass . - What is going on here ? There we have it . I leave your fiance you see baby pictures . As punishment because you did not call me first . Sit down . - Isabelle and I have to go . We have much to discuss . - Absolutely . My oldest is getting married and I 'm going to help you organize the wedding . We will decide nothing without you . We have to go . - That 's rude . I 'm sorry , but we have to go . Right now . Nice to see you again . - Likewise . I love you so much son . Actually we need the other way . Fine . You 're back . We are going to Covington ? - Do not play the boss , Josh . I found one of your greatest weaknesses . Can you talk a little louder ? I did not hear you . I was not talking to you . Sorry . I do not want to be annoying . I regret anyway . Of how things turned out . I just wanted to say out loud . Apology not accepted . Can you just shut up ? I must say that I so had not imagined . You work for the government , you carry a weapon . This thing between us , the wedding , have you fixed changed . As usual you do if everything is about you , Josh . If I 've changed , that has nothing to do with you . For you yesterday suddenly appeared , I had in five years thinking about you . You left still attracts a bit like you 're lying . Yes , I remember . This gift basket . We have reason to believe that there were drugs in those cookies . Since I do not know anything . I get things and deliver , nothing more . You gave them to me . Where did you pick them ? - That 's confidential . But for once then . It was an old building in the city . Here . 156 Liberty Avenue . Look at these people . They try disagree to hide . A lot has changed since I was a cop . You were on your own drugs helped the world . You 've become an angry , you know that ? I 'm not looking for a fight . I know I 'm not perfect . - You 're not even alive . All right . I was not perfect . This was largely due to my work . All that shit eats at you . Violence , mess . It sickened me . I could not put off me when I got home . That 's why I drank . That 's why I was sometimes mean to you and your mother . I do not talk well . But you seem to find an explanation for what I did . And I better not . You tell me nothing new , but good . Dealer that we seek , still had a school jack ? Why ? What are you worried about ? You can do nothing . Is this coincidence Blink ? So what ? Blink is new . That have they still can not keep. illegal Here we make some time for . We do that when killed . From whom do you get this stuff ? - I 'm not gonna tell you . Jarvis said what it was about ? - No , only that there was a breakthrough . Are these the affected agents ? NAOMI Bonderman disappeared : February 2 , 1992 These are Tom Baldwin and Diana Skouris . They are infected yesterday . I 'm really sorry . You were drugged . And those young people who commit suicide ... It 's awful . Who exactly are you ? My name is Naomi Bonderman . My gift did this to you . I have caused this . One day , three months ago ... I woke up what first appeared with sweaty hands . But then I realized it was not was sweat . It was a kind of oil . When I saw my sister for the first time . - He had not seen you for a long time ? Ruth has been dead for 30 years . But there she was standing by my bed . We have never been close . But once I realized I had not become crazy ... it was very cozy . After all these years we could things even finish . In the morning she was gone again . And when I hit Gordon 's hand . Gordon ? Is that your husband ? No , the postman . That night he was visited by some measure from the army ... who was killed in the war . When I started to wear gloves . Mrs. Bonderman , you know how it can that your gift is now sold ? Not at first . But now I think it has something to do with my chicken . I use a lot of herbs in cooking . I grow them myself . Only I have no gloves to , as I work in the garden . These herbs have absorbed the oil . My family came for Sunday dinner . And that night they all saw someone . It was very emotional . But it all turned out well . Nobody died . Can someone who used herbs have to make the drug It must be . The Tuesday after that dinner ... turned away all my plants . Torn from the ground . Someone stole that season , someone who knew what effect they had . I had hoped that my gift would be ever used ... as a type of therapy , to help people . But now it is sold on the street and people are dying . Terrible . Mrs. Bonderman , you know how long visions which usually last ? Sometimes the visitor days , or even weeks . But one thing I do know . The more you ignore them , the longer they stay ... and how insistent they are . Officially we are on leave , but I seeks to address just check ... that the courier gave up . See who those cookies came . Are you coming ? I wanted to Mrs. Bonderman long go , ask who were at that dinner . Since she was a little vague about . Do you think any of them to get went to grandma 's recipe ? It is a starting point . Isabelle , this must stop . You can not force me to marry . Cold feet , I read something about it . - That 's not it . Understand that I did not marry you . If you can not accept that ... Therefore , if you want to hurt me then you do that . Here I am . We 'll be there from . I would never hurt you , Shawn . That 's good to know . So it 's clear ? It 's over between us . You once said himself that good and bad was a choice . A choice you made . At the moment I have to make that choice . And if I lose you , I 'm afraid I make the wrong choice . Who are you going to threaten now ? My mother ? - I threaten anybody . I ask you for help . I was sent to do things . Bad things . Your mother and millions of others may die because of me . I do not know how you know that , but it does not have to be . You can fight it . - I 'm trying too . We must therefore remain two together . Because you 're the only that can stop me . Is it really here ? Yes . I stood here , the man came from behind and gave me the cookies . That was it . - According to the manager ... is this office for eight months empty . They were drug dealers , you said ? That relocate often fixed . Maybe they have different addresses . Do you remember the man you gave the cookies yet ? I have not really given him . Maybe I would recognize him . Can I go , if there is no one right ? I gotta get back to work . Sure . Thanks for your help . Call me if you remember anything . Sure . Is that a clue ? - I 'm trying to work . I also find little to . I also have my job . There must be something you want to say . Shall we talk about the past ? You betrayed me , two weeks before marriage . Who does that ? I thought it was . - I was not so over . That pain , the betrayal . But I have it behind me . You . I 've moved on . And I want now hear another word from you . Josh ? Are we ready ? Anyone can climb over that fence . Thanks for pointing it at me . Remember when you helped me as a kid mowing the lawn ? I remember you uitkafferde me if I skipped something . You had to do it well . Proud at work . A man . It worked . I constantly think : what would you do ? And then I do the opposite . Always good . So I know you again . Tommy knows everything . However , as for you , yes . Tell me this once . The last time I was in hospital ... why did not you come along then ? It is a simple question , Tom . Agent Baldwin , you pull in iced tea ? Barry was there , Kathleen with the twins ... They have the whole night crying . Philip and his new girlfriend . Her name I can not remember . Roger and Julie . Oh no . Julie was sick that day . Headache . She did so often . That 's my grandson , Randy . - From Door 2 Door couriers ? He is still searching . - Does he know of your gift ? Of course . He was also at the dinner . He intercepted twice . According to the neighbors Randy just left . They do not know where he went . He is not at work . I look in the bedroom , maybe I can find an address book . Have you never break ? I thought I 'd lost you . No , we still have some things to discuss . Remember when you said you were all over me ? I 'm not sure I believe that . - . I do not care Maybe not . But if you 're over me ... why did you no longer had relationships ? I had sat relationships . And all of them were more respectful and more successful than ours . Name one . - How about Marco ? A sweet boy who would do anything for you . You can learn a lot from him . - It 's a relationship without a future . Why you 're with him . I do not know what our future is . As long as I do not know him . Yet You 're dating a few months and as soon as he wants more ... you tell him the truth : That there is no chemistry . You do not match . Things you know already . I 'm really dealing with my boyfriends ? Di , you 're a great woman and I blew it . I was cruel . But you can be yourself not take forever in protection . That is not fair to yourself , or against Marco . Someone 's been baking , I guess . Yes , but where are the cookies gone ? You have my question still not answered . Why did not you come along when I was dying ? I can not talk about it now . It 's not my favorite memory . Come on , we are just as . I 'll leave you alone . If I tell you , we are ready ? Then you 're gone ? It is a step in the right direction . - I was in Baltimore for the FBI . When Mom called , I booked a flight immediately . But then the case took a new turn and I missed my flight . Then it was too late . I asked you for the truth . These are excuses . You want the truth ? I stayed away for you for a favor . You did not want me to , Dad . Everything I did , made you angry . It would be easier for you if I was not there . I let you die in peace . I wanted to see you again . You 're my son , Tommy . I love you . That 's good to know , but it 's too late . I know it . It was my fault . I 'm sorry . But I wanted you to do , Tommy . You were wrong , what my feelings are concerned . Perhaps also with other things . Hopefully you have a closet full of cookies found . Unfortunately . He took them . Look at this . Behind the closet . He kept by whom he had drugged . A list of his enemies ? He wanted take revenge on all those people ? Diana . The fair . That is today . Now we know where those cookies remained . Stand still . Arise . Where are the other cookies ? - They are . Really . We were just in time . Diana . Walk . Good work . - NTAC it gets busy . We 'll keep an eye on and offer help . You had to be busy address. your own problems Priorities , eh . If my dad suddenly appeared , I also work a lot harder . But now I want you to go home go and processing . And otherwise ... you get two rooms next together at NTAC Medical , okay ? I wanted to hurt anyone . Tell that to Erika Lundgren . I 'm sorry , really . But I just gave them the opportunity to handle their problems . I wanted to share that light . They could not handle it . I do not see the connection . Why you sent us cookies ? What are you talking about ? You have the promicin scandal revealed and saved my grandmother 's life . It was a gift . To thank you . To thank ? So you see , no good deed goes unpunished . Are you sure it is not Isabelle has invented to make you afraid ? To bind you to it ? Because this sounds insane , Shawn . I can heal people , you telekinesis . It 's a crazy world . When she was a baby , even when she was still in the womb ... I knew she was different . Dangerous . If I thought I could save lives by staying with Isabelle ... I would marry her tomorrow . But what happens next ? If she was hit me ? Or if I make her angry ? I get it . Marriage is not the solution . We must find a way to stop her . It 's my daughter , Shawn . What do you want me to do ? I was out with friends . When I heard your message , I am come immediately . Is it ? Italian food I 've met . Do not be so sweet . That does not sound good . It is not fine , but you do what is right . Can we say goodbye ? Indeed . Try not to miss me , Di . No problem . So you 're leaving ? I 've only made unhappy . I 've already done enough when you were little . We have to be ready . We will not get much further . Take care of yourself . I 'd shake your hand , but that does not work . Dad ? What I said earlier ... I missed that flight for you to have fun ? That was not true . I knew that . I did it for myself . The idea that I should watch how you died ... while there was still so much unsaid ... and we would never be as close as I 'd like ... I could not . It 's good , Tommy . I had not earned . I should have been there anyway . I 'm sorry . Suddenly our time was ticking away . Time now does not matter , right ? I have all the time in the world . But we do not need to use . Why do not you sit ? You do not need to do . - I know . But ... But just come back and sit down , okay ? I like to eat alone . There is nothing worse . Well ... where did you want to talk about ? Happy now ? You tried . It did not work . You can find me not kill , Shawn . So then we 're still married .

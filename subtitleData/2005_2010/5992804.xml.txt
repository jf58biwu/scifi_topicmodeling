 MOHINDER : Previously on Heroes . A fax came in this morning addressed to Hiro and Ando . HIRO : Someone named Rebel . Who ? Just an address in Los Angeles and the words " Save Matt Parkman . " S YLAR : I 've been here before . I remember . Mommy ? S YLAR : He killed my mother . LUKE : Where are you going ? To find my father . I want him to die . Why are you doing this , Nathan ? Saving your life or trying to save the world ? Goodbye , Nathan . Pete ! NATHAN : Tracy ... Don 't come any closer . ( MOANS ) You 'd better get used to the heat because you are never getting out of here again . Looks like your friend 's back . Rebel ? I think there 's something he wants us to see . That 's us . That 's the entire operation . They got the whole thing on tape . PETER : It 's done . I got it ! MATT : Go , go , go , go ! Don 't do this . Go ! I 'll hold them ! To me , you look exactly like a terrorist . No . You ... Hey , Barbie . I got a message from someone named Rebel . Said you could help me . I need your help , Barbie . Rebel promised . Well , he lied . Now get out ! Please , I can 't go back out there . Claire ? You okay ? Oh , my God . Mom , it 's all right . Mr. Doyle , here , was just leaving . No . Please , they 'll catch me . Rebel said you could help me start over . That 's all I want . To go back to being a puppeteer , making people happy . And you thought I would help you ? After what you did ? You should know , there are agents parked outside this house . Actually , they 're not . Rebel sent a fake call , which they 'll figure out any minute now . But if there were agents outside , why aren 't they kicking in the door looking to collect a comes-back-to-life Barbie ? They gave me a free pass . But they will come after me if I try to help anyone . So you turn your back on your own kind while we 're all out there being hunted down ? They burned down my theater while I was still inside . And you tried to kill us , you ... ( BOTH GASPING ) You and your free pass , you have no idea what it 's like to be hunted , to live on the street , to break into the home of the last person on Earth you 'd expect to help you , because she was your only hope . I thought ... ( BOTH EXHALE ) Well , I 'm not gonna force you to help me , Claire . That 's not who I am anymore . ( DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ) Where the hell have you been ? Dealing with the mess your brother left us . There wouldn 't have been a mess if you 'd released Parkman and Millbrook like I asked you to . I made the right choice . Peter just got lucky . Though I have wondered , how many people knew he was on that rooftop ? ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) Petrelli . What ? Yeah , I 'm on my way . I thought Parkman was in your custody . He was , last time I checked . Then what the hell 's he doing in front of the Capitol Building with a bomb strapped to his chest ? ( SIRENS WAILING ) No . No , no , no . No , no . Wait . Deactivate the device , now ! Then lie face down ! No , no , if I try and pull this , this could ... I didn 't do this ! I was set up ! Senator Nathan Petrelli . Sir , this is a very dangerous situation . I can 't let you ... Lieutenant , I know that man . I can get through to him . You 've got five minutes . Parkman ! Oh , you son of a bitch ! Don 't you come any closer to me . Everything 's gonna be all right . No , it 's not ! You turned me into a terrorist ! I didn 't sanction this . That was Danko . You 're lying to me ! He 's got an agenda . You 're lying to me . ( GUN COCKS ) Believe me , Matt . Use your powers , read my mind . I 'm telling you the truth . I can 't . I can 't , they drugged me . You 're gonna have to trust me , Matt . Parkman 's vest is ready , sir . But we may have a problem here . Petrelli ! How 'd he get there so fast ? Is the device armed ? We 're all set . The Senator wants to play hero ? But in a stunning turn of events ... He can be a martyr for his own cause . Take them out . ( BEEPS ) Code confirmed , sir . Do it . Take him out , now ! ( BEEPING ) I don 't know where this came from ! I 'm gonna blow up ! We 've been kicked out . Get it back ! Now ! ... on the Senator 's involvement , though there are those who believe that he may know the bomber personally . We 'll continue to bring you updates ... What 's going on here ? Come on , we 're losing our window . Routing through a different server . Matt , if we don 't disarm you , they 're gonna shoot you . There are a lot of bomb techs around here . I 'm sure one of them is thinking about how to disarm that . Get inside his head . The drugs are starting to wear off , but I don 't think I ... What 's he thinking ? BOMB TECH : Red wire . Red wire , red wire ! Red wire . BOMB TECH : It doesn 't make any sense . Why would a suicide bomber bother with dummy wiring ? Don 't touch the red wire ! I 'm not touching anything ! Senator , we have to take the shot . Just hang on ! It 's all right , Matt , take your time . BOMB TECH : Black wire is the key . Black wire , black wire ! Black wire , black wire . Do I pull the black wire , or is that the one I don 't pull ? I don 't know . He 's not thinking directly about it . I gotta dig deeper . Hold on ! I got it . We 're back up ! Weapon armed , sir . Senator ! Matt , I 'm gonna pull it . Do it . Danko ! I said , do it ! MATT : Wait ! Damn it ! OFFICER : Move in , go ! Sorry , Matt . I can 't have you using your power . It 's open . ( COUGHS ) Almost got the order ready . You have a lot of pickups today ? I 'm not here for a pickup . No ? It 's me . Gabriel . Your son . Is that so ? That is so . What brings you all the way out here ? I had some questions about myself . Who I am , where I came from . But then I remembered . You abandoned me . You killed my mother . So , what now ? Now ? I kill you . Go right ahead . ( COUGHS ) You kill me , or the cancer does . Either way , I die . I haven 't got all day . Anything ? This guy 's good . There 's no sign the system was even breached . I wanna know how the hell he 's getting inside , and I want a name . NATHAN : Me , too . So we can thank them for saving us from this disaster . Of course . Since the safety of your friends and family evidently trumps national security . Parkman wasn 't a threat until you strapped a bomb to him . Parkman and your brother exposed our operation , so I handled it , put a face to the terrorist threat . People could have died . People have died , Senator . Or don 't my men count ? I was brought in to get this job done . I 'd let go of that if I were you . You 're relieved of command . I answer to the president . If you try to get rid of me , he 's gonna want proof , and right now it 's my word against yours . Good luck getting any of my people to turn on me . We 'll see . Excuse me . Bennet , you have a minute ? I 'm not sure how much I can tell you about what happened . I know what happened last night . I wanna talk to you about putting a team together once Danko 's gone . You 're gonna head ... TRAC Y ON TV : You 're one of us , Nathan ! You 're one of us ! You 're one of us , Nathan ! You 're one of us ! Do you have a point ? That maybe this operation 's been compromised from the start . The Petrelli family has a lot of skeletons in their closet , Senator . I think we both know what yours is . So , looks like we 're both building a case against each other . Let 's see who gets there first . You 're one of us , Nathan . You 're one of us ! The son of a bitch went over my head . What did you expect ? You backed a wild dog into a corner . I had to act . But you didn 't act . All you did was show Danko your hand . And frankly , you put both of us at risk . I have a plan , Noah . Nathan , listen to me . He 's pushing your buttons so that you 'll make a mistake . Take a play from your mother 's book . Keep your head . ( DOOR UNLOCKS ) Sorry about all this . I find that hard to believe . The man who transferred you back here is gonna come in , in a few moments , and ask you some questions . I was wondering when that was gonna happen . I know this might seem hard to believe , but I still care about you . That makes one of us . Come on , you 're smarter than that . You might not realize it , but I have been helping you out all along . You and everyone else . And doing a fabulous job of it . You remember when you jumped off the bridge , and I was there ? I 'm still the same guy . You sacrificed me for your own personal gain . You don 't have to like me . But you do have to understand that I am your last hope . That 's my prisoner . You got a soft spot for this one , Petrelli ? Wanna make sure I don 't get too rough with her ? No , no , knock yourself out . I wanna know everything you know about Nathan Petrelli . He was lousy in bed . I wanna know what you meant when you said he was one of us . Does Nathan have an ability ? An ability ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . ( SIGHS ) You wanna talk about it ? ( SIGHS ) Should I have helped Doyle ? That puppet man is a sick and twisted individual , Claire . You did the right thing . I have a free pass for a reason . I should be using it to help people . Rebel seems to think so . Yes , well , this Rebel , whoever he is , can 't send psychopaths to our front doorstep . I don 't think I can take any more surprise guests . Right , which is why I was thinking that I should have a cover job . I mean , with Alex gone , they 're probably gonna need someone to fill his job at the comic-book store , and I could help whoever Rebel sends , and no more surprise guests for you and Lyle . Boy , Claire , I don 't know . I guess so . If it 's what you wanna do . Thanks . So you don 't have any retail experience ? Um , does a cheerleading bake sale count ? You 're a cheerleader ? Yeah , I was . All right , so let me ask you a few questions . Can you work Wednesdays ? Wednesdays ? Wednesdays are when all the new comics arrive . Wednesday is good for me . Flight or invisibility ? I 'm sorry , what ? Do you throw caution to the wind and fly off to save the day ? Or do you take the more calculated approach and learn the whole picture before you act ? What 's the answer ? There isn 't one . That 's why it 's the question . Put simply , what type of hero are you ? I don 't know . Hey , hey , hey , you 're not gonna cry , are you ? ( STAMMERING ) It 's okay , really . They 're only comic books . It 's nothing . I 'm gonna stop bothering you . Thank you for letting me interview , anyway . What are you talking about ? You got the job . I did ? Every guy in the store has been staring at you since you walked in . You will absolutely sell comic books . And the other stuff , we can work on . SAMSON : ( COUGHING ) You 're still here ? ( COUGHING ) This is pitiful . What 's that ? What you 've become . You used to be a killer . Now look at you , you 're pathetic . Oh , you want a fight ? That 's what you were expecting ? Son kills his father , epic battle , huh ? That 's a myth . Now , life ... Life never gives you what you want . Give me a hand with this , maybe I can explain it to you . Now when I open the trap , he 's gonna bolt , so grab him from the back , all right ? ( WHISTLING ) ( COUGHS ) You have an ability . I got lots of them . Don 't know what I got left . It 's been years since I used them or needed them . You have the same thing , taking people 's abilities . Am I right ? ( CHUCKLES ) Guess the apple didn 't fall too far from the tree . I 'm not your apple . You don 't know anything about me . I have some idea . You and I , we can 't be all that different . From where I stand , we have exactly nothing in common . Yeah , well , we pick easy targets . Like that rabbit . Weak , helpless . It 's not fair , really . Are you really drawing a moral line ? Morality ? Doesn 't figure into it . Fish gotta swim , birds gotta fly . You have to kill , it 's who you are . But you do choose your prey . And yours never had a chance . Not against you . Not really . Easy pickings . Small game . They had something I wanted . It isn 't my fault if they weren 't strong enough to fight back . ( CHUCKLES ) And those agents that have been coming after us recently ? I handled them . No , you ran away from them . Just like I did . I could wipe them out with a thought . But you haven 't . Why ? You know , there 'll come a day , maybe tomorrow , or next week , next year , when you realize the hunt , your entire life , was meaningless and disappointing , because there 's no challenge in it . You know , all the power in the world doesn 't matter if you 've lived an unsatisfied life . But I think you know that already , don 't you ? You wanna know more , or you gonna kill me now ? What do I do ? Gut him . ( FLESH TEARING ) While you were at Primatech , did you come across anyone who could fly ? Plenty . But you know that . It 's in the files . I 'm guessing a few are missing . The facility burned to the ground , who knows what was lost ? That must have been tough for you . Twenty years on the job . I 'm sure you 'd have grown close to the Petrelli family . The Petrellis were never exactly a warm and fuzzy bunch . You adopted the Senator 's daughter . Didn 't know she was his at the time . And neither did he , for that matter . We both know Nathan Petrelli is hiding something . You know what question you should be asking yourself ? " Who would want to save Peter ? " His mother , Angela ? If you wanna know what 's missing from the files , who can fly ... She 'd never betray her own son . A long time ago , I gave up trying to figure out what Angela Petrelli would or wouldn 't do . ( PHONE RINGING ) Go ahead . MR. BENNET : We 've got a problem . Nathan 's made a power play against Danko , and he 's stirred up a hornet 's nest . It 's nice to know a mother still has some influence over her son . Things will be better for us with Danko gone . Of course they will , but Nathan 's on thin ice . He 's moving too fast , and Danko 's unpredictable . The man nearly killed Peter . It had to be done . Be prepared , then , ' cause I 've pointed him in your direction . Be careful , he does his homework . So do I. Homework . Thank you . See you tomorrow . See you , Claire . Bye ! Claire ? You all right ? Everything okay at home ? Yeah , that 's not what this is about . I have a question . And I really need you to answer it . Okay . How did you lead two lives for all that time ? I can 't always be myself , and I just don 't know who I 'm supposed to be . Honestly , Claire , I 'm the worst person to ask . So how am I supposed to decide which path to take ? Which answer do you want ? You want the one that 's gonna make you feel better , or do you want the truth ? I don 't know . Well , then , my answer is , neither do I. Thanks . I miss you , Claire-bear . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) Doyle ! Freeze ! Put your hands over your head . ( GUN COCKING ) ( PANTING ) Whatever you say . When are you gonna learn ? I have this effect on women . Doyle , I 'm giving you a chance to surrender . I should kill you . But I just wanna go back to the way life was . All right , Doyle . Barbie . Mrs. Petrelli . My name is ... Mr. Danko . I was hoping you could help me . Well , everything I know about the people you 're after is in the Primatech files . I 'm not interested in the files . Elle Bishop , Hiro Nakamura , Matt Parkman all inherited abilities from their parents . As did Peter and Claire . Well , genetics is an extremely complex topic , Mr. Danko . Did you know that two blue-eyed parents can sometimes have a brown-eyed child ? So Nathan was the misfit ? Sometimes these things skip a generation . I don 't believe you . I 've met many men like you , Mr. Danko . Our company employed dozens of them . No family . Nothing to hold you back . You operate in the shadows , doing all the awful things other people just refuse to do . That 's what makes you useful . And expendable . Really ? That incident in Angola , 1997 , I believe . All those civilians lost . Tragic . I 'm surprised you survived , actually . You 're a very resourceful woman , Mrs. Petrelli . ( SLURPING ) A man needs a hobby . Something to occupy the hands , to stop the mind from thinking so much . I fix watches . Watches ? I thought it would make my father happy . How did that work out for you ? You 're still clinging to that need for connection , huh ? The only thing people are good for is disappointment . Is that why you killed my mother ? Why you abandoned me ? I don 't even remember . It didn 't matter to me . So few things do . Well , now what ? Cut the thread . Go on . ( EXCLAIMS IN PAIN ) How did you do that ? It 's just an ability I picked up from a cheerleader in California . I guess not everybody gets old . Not everybody dies . Then you just have that much longer to suffer , don 't you ? ( COUGHING ) Get that . It needs to settle . Over there , on that cabinet , if you don 't mind . Sure . ( GASPING ) What the hell are you doing ? It 's amazing how it comes right back , that desire , that hunger . You think this is gonna stop me ? You think you can beat me ? I want that power ! ( WHISTLING ) I thought you 'd given up . Yeah , well , me , too . Then why bother ? What 's the point ? Immortality . You 're my second chance . At what ? Killing again ? You said it was meaningless . It was . Then why make the same mistake twice ? Because I 'll get it right this time . Do more , be more . Take every challenge . Fight hard , risk it all . Take real power , real authority . Change everything , the world . Just to see if I can . ( GASPS ) You can move ? I can . ( CHUCKLES ) You 're the hunter . I thought you would know when someone was playing possum , when the prey isn 't so weak , so easy . ( GRUNTS ) ( CHOKING ) Please , I need that power . I don 't want to die . No , no , no . Of course not . Of course you don 't . It won 't kill you if I take it . You 'll heal . You 'll be fine . Yeah , but so will you . ( CHOKING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) No , don 't leave . Like I said , I came here to kill you . I got the answers I wanted . Now I know exactly what I need to do . Kill me . Oh , you 're gonna die . Slowly , painfully and alone with your sickness . Please , don 't . I 'm sorry . You 're just small game . Turns out the President didn 't really need that much proof after all . It 's a signed document . You 're finished . You lose me , you lose the whole team . That 's a risk I 'm prepared to take . In fact , anyone who 's not on board can step out now . You 're hitting reset on the whole operation just because of me ? I think it 's time things were done correctly . You may have friends now , Petrelli , but one day , you 're gonna find yourself all alone . You went to the President ? Mmm-hmm . And he 's eager to meet Danko 's replacement . Coming ? So , you 're the man with the plan . I sure hope you have something good to share with the President . It 's a bit unorthodox , but it 's tested . Look , it 's over . Just let it go . When are you gonna understand ? Bureaucracy , oversight , rules of conduct , none of it applies in my world . I don 't know what your world is , but it ought to be shut down . ( GUN COCKING ) Danko , take it easy . I 've seen what these people can do and it scares me . And the thing about you , Senator , is that through all this , you 've never once shown an ounce of fear . I wonder , why is that ? I don 't have time for this . Tell me you didn 't know about this . This is it , your new identity . Everything you need to start over . Rebel 's erased any trace of Eric Doyle . You saw me spare that agent 's life , is that it ? Have I earned your help ? This isn 't about you . This is about me , about who I need to be right now , and I don 't ... Just take it . Thanks , Barbie . Did you mean all that stuff you said ? About how you changed ? ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Finally ! I quit , and it takes the service two hours to find a replacement ? Well , don 't just stand there . Come in . I 'm desperate . Excuse me , please . We are looking for Matt Parkman . No duh . Anyway , he 's a mess . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Here you go . Diaper 's clean , but that won 't hold . Take it . Take it . No , thank you . Now ! Hey , wait ! We are here to save Matt Parkman . Uh-huh . You 're holding him . Matt Parkman . Lots of luck . You 're gonna need it . By the way , this babysitting service bites . MOHINDER : Generations unfold , father to son , mother to daughter . Where one leaves off , the other follows , ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) Destined to repeat each other 's mistakes , each other 's triumphs . For how do we see the world if not through their lens ? The same fears , the same desires . Do we see them as an example to follow , or as a warning of what to avoid ? Choosing to live as they have simply because it 's what we know , or driven to create our own identity ? And what happens if we find them to be a disappointment ? Can we replace them ? Our mothers , our fathers ? Or will destiny find a way to drive us back , back to the familiar comforts of home ?

 Ünderland . We were robbed . No two ways about it . I don 't know , pop , they won fair and square . The Impossible family made a really convincing Fantastic Four . Don 't make excuses for your brother . He blew it for all of us . Henry Allen Venture , are you hearing this ? What do you have to say for yourself ? - l am The Bat . - Yes , yes . You are The Bat . And The Bat is the reason we didn 't take best group costume , mister . Again ! Last year , it was Dorothy , the Scarecrow , the Cowardly Lion ... and ... The Bat . And how about the time we were the hard rocking quartet ... of Gene Simmons , Paul Stanley , Ace Frehley ... and The Bat ! - The night is mine . - Sell it somewhere else , Hank . It 's not me you should be apologizing to . Poor Brock spent a month ... sewing his group team-appropriate costume . That 's probably why he won best costume ? What is that , sass I hear ? " Look everybody , Hank 's back . " The re-circulated air on my chest is a bat ... - What 's the matter ? - My tongue got caught in the mouth slit . - Don 't stick it in the slit then . - l can 't help it . It 's maddening . He 's here , your graciousness . Who ? Dr. Venture , your ... Say it again and it will be your last ... time saying his name . Quick ! To the science box ! - What are you doing ? - We 'll pass over Ünderland , I 'll go around . What am I , made of experimental super sonic jet fuel ? - lt 's shorter this way . - lt 's smaller than Delaware , Doc . It won 't take long . Let 's just play it safe . Fire off the atomic super magnet ! Full power ! Prepare yourself to throw the switch on my order . When they are within range , we shall pluck them from the sky ... like a gleaming metal peach from a giant blue tree . My sweet little Rusty . How many years have I longed for this moment ? How many years has it been since ... college ! But now Baron Ünderbheit finally exacts his sweet revenge . - Sir , we 're ... - No ! Say hello to goodbye , Dr. Venture . We 've lost control of our engines . I 'm The Bat , I 'm The Bat . What the hell was that ? What 's up with my fillings ? Can 't ... keep her ... together . - Lock down auxiliary power . - Gotta make it to the border . Chewie , lock down auxiliary power . Everybody , get in the black box , it 's indestructible . Thank God . Out of Ünderland . Ventures , sound off . Yeah , pretty sure my scoliosis is going the other way now . - My butt won 't stop making a fist . - At least you have one . You 're blessed with your father 's ass , Dean . Learn to love stadium cushions . - l told you to lock down on ... - We don 't have auxiliary power ! This might get ugly fast , Doc . Here , take this . It 's loaded with arsenic , gold size standard field issue . Jeez , can you be anymore dramatic ? Ünderbheit 's all bluster and you know it . - Doc , the guy still blames you . - That crap with his jaw ? Never proven . Come on , it 's been 20 years . - He can 't still be mad about that ! - Look around , jackass ! Not yet . You still have a chance . Don 't take all of it . - Or else what ? I 'll overdose on poison ? - l meant , share it with the boys . Cool ! Secret super spiced suicide tooth ? Sign me up . You know what would be even cooler ? - Cherry Italian ice tooth . - Yeah . What is he doing here ? Put them in the holding cells , while I decide how they are to die . We don 't have holding cells here . No holding ... ? Fine ! Then put them in the pantry . Wait ! Leave that one with me . - Hank . - Dean . So , you thought you could keep yourself hidden from Baron Ünderbheit ? You 're much healthier looking than the others . So tender , so soft ... I bet you could use some fattening up . You 'd make a most exquisite ... dinner ... - ... guest . - What ? I said , thank you for being my dinner guest . - How 's your timber wolf ? - What ? ! This is no good . Hang on . There . - lt 's much cozier this way , don 't you think ? - What have you done with pop ? Your father 's resting comfortably in a makeshift holding cell . Soon ... - What have you done with my brother ? - He too is being held in the ... What have you done with our secret agent bodyguard ? They 're all in the same place , OK ? Please , they 're all in your past . And tonight is about the future . Eat something , please . The bounty of Ünderland is yours to enjoy . Go fish ! I 'm not fattening myself up for you . If you 're gonna eat me , then you can just ... deal with the gristle . is that why you think I brought you here ? That is rich ! I will have to tell manservant that one . And he we will have to laugh . You 're not gonna eat me ? Of course not . I am going to make you the second most powerful person in Ünderland . - Neat ! - So your answer 's yes ? Not that you have a choice . Excellent ! We will be married in the morning then . What ? ! I 'm not marrying you ! I know , you 're worried it won 't work out . It 's true I 've been married several times before . Seven , in fact . They resisted at first too , but they came around , as you will . It 's like I always say ... hopelessness is the greatest aphrodisiac ... in Ünderland . My dear ... I don 't want you on your back this soon . Wait until after the wedding . I 'd better get this back to the cave and run it through the computer for prints . Damn it ! - What does he want Dean for ? - Mental selection . Single out the weakest of the pack , separate him from the others . That was addressed to me . " You and your guests are cordially invited to attend ... " the unholy union of His Malevolence , Baron Verner Ünderbheit the Fourth ... " and your daughter ... Dawn . " Execution to follow . " I have a sister ? Named Dawn ? How long have you been keeping this from me ? - Hank , no , I think ... - Don 't defend him , Brock . You knew about this , didn 't you ? Does Dean ... ? - What else haven 't you told us ? - Brock , you speak crazy . - Do something about him . - Hank , Baron Ünderbheit ... Good grief , you 're right , Brock ! This is just what he wants for us to turn on each other . And I played right into their hands . Damn it ! How are you ? The Wallflower ! So we meet again . No , no , Wallflower had that thing on his head . Lamest villain ever . - You 're Dr. Venture . - Who the hell wants to know ? So it is true ! You are in Ünderland . This is a rescue , come . Follow me . I 'm so excited , I can hardly sleep . She 's just so ... unlike the others . Such spunk , und her disdain for me it 's sweeter , somehow . I don 't know , what do you think ? Please , Manic 8-ball , tell me now ! I 've been burnt by love before . Will this marriage be a success or not ? Why do you torture me so ? At least tell me she 'll last longer than the others . I knew it ! I had a feeling about her . Tell me , my fallen advisor ! Just one more thing and I promise I won 't ask any more . Will I have a boy ? You 've made your Baron a happy man ! Und to reward you , I grant you your release for one hour ... so that you may come to the wedding . Here we are . Colonel Catclops can hardly wait to meet you . Welcome comrades ... to the Ünderground . - l usually do my own hair . - Don 't be too proud of that , honey . What are you conditioning with , kerosene ? Touchy. I can 't work my magic if you don 't work with me , honey . Oh , my God ! Look at this . She 's got an ass like a twelve year old boy . I 'm so jealous . No wonder the master likes her . No I didn 't ! You . You 're cruising for an execution , girlfriend . Honey , I have seen seven Baronesses come and go ... and they all say the same thing . The master likes playing the back nine at Augusta . Well , I 'm done here , gotta get cracking on the gown . Girl , you are going to look spectacular . Ciao . Love and light , bitch . - How come you don 't have an accent ? - Honey , I 'm from Detroit . I guess your experimental super sonic flying laboratory crashed too , huh ? No , I wanted to go somewhere exotic for junior year abroad . And I was mad at somebody . Sorry . I didn 't mean to ... Ancient history , sweetie , you didn 't know . Now , lets get you into the tub ... and see if we can 't scrub some of the the hoi polloi off you . We want you Holy Golightly not Eliza Doolittle. I 'm a eunuch , honey ! You think Ünderbheit would let another pair of balls near his wife ? Trust me , even when I had them , you 've got nothing I 'm interested in . Rooster in the henhouse ! I 'm fixed , what 's your excuse ? Do you have Prince Albert in the can ? Well , you should get him out of the can so that he can breath maybe . Needs work . You 've gotta sell it . This is the nerve centre of the Ünderground , gentlemen . From here we launch our relentless campaign ... of sabotage , subterfuge and psychological warfare . These are some of the bravest men in Ünderland . They have to be . The penalties for treason are dire indeed . I 'm proud to say we 've only lost one man to date . Helmut . Crazy SOB tried to take on Ünderbheit by himself . He was caught trying to dip his hand in warm water while he slept . To make him pee ? Classic ! Exactly . Ünderbheit saw it coming a mile away . That was close . - Well , did it work ? - Yeah , it was perfect . - Atta girl ! - You should have seen it . We struck again tonight , should I tell them ? - Let me . - OK . We planted a cat hair in the Baron 's water glass . is that a scream or what ? That will show the bastard . Trying to blow us up ? I don 't think so ! These people deserve their crappy country . You call yourselves a resistance movement ? - We pick our battles . - Yeah , we take it where we can get it . Now that you are here to rescue us none of this will be necessary any more . So , what time are we flying out ? What the hell are you talking about ? Rescue you ? - We were the ones in prison ! - ln pantry , technically . You haven 't come to rescue us ? Then why did you bring the bat person ? - And Chewbacca Wookie ? - Oh , my God ! Look , we were in a costume party , our plane crashed . If we don 't storm Ünderbheit 's castle at dawn , he 's gonna marry Doc 's son . Not me . So are you with us or are you wasting our time ? Slow down there , Andretti . Storm the castle ? What are we , crazy ? Slow and steady wins the race . We 're out of here . Just a second , Seabiscuit . You 've seen our secret headquarters . We can 't just ... let you leave . What are you gonna do ? Put sugar in our gas tank ? Yeah , OK , you go ahead . - Nice buns . - Didn 't see that one coming . You 're really not gonna tell on me ? Of course not . Us girls have to stick together , right ? I think we own the Baron for a couple of things . - Four between us . - Stop it , you terrible boy . You just play your part , sweetie , we 're gonna call some friends first . It 's time , my Baron . How do I look ? I can 't stop pocking the slits with my tongue , it 's maddening . Be happy for the slits . The old masks were much worse without them . You would pass out . You have no idea what that means , do you ? Sure I do . You 're just having fun with your hands , aren 't you ? No . All right , we 're outnumbered , but we have the element of surprise on our side . Doc , you 're useless in a fight . Just stay behind us . Hank , remember your lessons from the judo room . Follow my lead and make sure that you leave one alive for questioning . - You got it ? - My plan would have worked . - You got it ? ! - Yes , sir . - So much for the element of surprise . - Maybe not . Useless . - Brock , questioning ? - That 's the one . Who are you working for ? We know that part , Hank . Like this . Where 's the wedding being held ? Talk ! Go ahead ! The pain will be nothing compared ... to what the master will do to me if I betray him . This is still nothing compared to what the master ... - What ? - Nothing . No , what ? Well I ... I don 't know how to tell you this but I ... I feel a ... - A lump . - Are you serious ? Yeah ... you ... I 'm so sorry , man . Oh , God . Oh , God . - Yeah , I just feel awful . - How do you think I feel ? Yeah , maybe we should ... I must go to my wife . Yeah , yeah . You should do that . Hey , look , I know it 's a bad time to ask and all , but ... The wedding ? Yeah . Yeah fine , I don 't care anymore . It 's in the observatory ... another flight up through this door . Hank ? ! What ? I didn 't get to do anything . Damn it . What now ? I 'll come back for you . Hank , no . You gotta sit tight while I figure out a way out of this . It 's OK , Brock . I know I was mixed up before but now I 'm groovy . I 'm going ahead with the mission . Lock and load . - lt 's not a gun , Hank . - Whatever . He 's got an entire army , Hank . Exactly . They won 't be expecting one lone warrior . It 's just crazy enough to work ! - Talk to your son , Doc . - Boy , listen to your bodyguard . Pop , you once spent weeks in your lab . You were all alone without sleep or food , trying desperately to isolate the gay gene . And I know you. lf it wasn 't for all the protestors and the hearings ... you would have found it and destroyed it . And why ? To keep stuff like this from happening . And Brock do you want Ünderbheit to come and live with us ? Do you really want to be that big jerk 's , pardon my French ... that big jerk 's bodyguard-in-law ? Hank , no . It 's suicide . Then I 'll see you in heck ! Thank goodness , Hank 's going to save us all . What are you so worried about ? I can make another one . Hey , maybe he 'll surprise us . He does get that kind of retard strength when he 's all worked up . Help ! Dr. Venture ! You decided to attend the wedding after all ? I 'm afraid you won 't be able to give the bride away , however ... because ... we 're already married . Weak . Hey , pop . Hey , Brock . You OK , Hank ? Caught my tongue on my mask . May I present to you ... the eighth Baroness of Ünderland , the ... I just realized I don 't know your name . It 's Dean ! Dean Venture . And stop getting all big hands on me . Dean ? Nein , nein , this is not the name for a Baroness . That 's because he 's not a Baroness . He 's not even a woman . He 's right , I 'm not a woman . I 'm a boy science adventurer , like my father before me . What I wouldn 't give for those . In the name of Ünderlaw . I demand that you arrest Baron Ünderbheit . Catclops , so you survived ? Wait a minute the cat hairs in my water ! Of course ! Same sex marriage is illegal under Ünderlaw , Ünderbheit . - Well , say that five times faster . - l 'm pretty sure that kid 's underage , too . Well I 'm ... not sure that 's illegal . Anyway , it 's over . Betrayer ! You will pay . Mess with the cat and you get the clops . Yeah , you mess with the Girl and you get the Hitler . Marry me . Welcome to Michigan , Agent Samson . That 's Brock Samson , that 's who that is . Doctor Venture , wait . We wanted to thank you . The Ünderground has all decided we shall give you this . It is the highest honor Ünderland can bestow upon an outlander . Thanks . But if you 're trying to butter me up for a ride ... No , Dr. Venture , Ünderland is free now . We 're all going to stay . Und found a democracy , we even picked our president . Listen , I 'm flattered . Girl Hitler . Really , I 'm happy for you , honey . A girl president ? How progressive ! And a Hitler . Boy , things are really looking up . Go Team Venture ! So , what will happen to Ünderbheit now ? Well , we really want to soften the image of Ünderland , so we can 't execute him . So my first official act as President is to banish the prick . You know , I 'm right here . You don 't have to talk about me . We found these when we raided the royal vaults . - l think they 're yours . - No , you didn 't . Goodbye , Ventures . Walk with God . Come back and visit us sometime ! You 're always welcome in Ünderland . Don 't anybody get up or anything . Hi . Could I maybe , crash here for a little bit ? Just got divorced . ¡ Qué sopa más buena !

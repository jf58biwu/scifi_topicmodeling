No , it 's not your fault . It 's your ability . There 's a hunger that you cannot control . It 's made you that way But we 're gonna fix that . I think I 've just found a few of them . They made the news . Police were called in what was described as An incredible scene when four gentlemen Came in to rob the first federal bank In poughkeepsie , new york , this morning . One of the robbers was equipped - With what appeared to be a flame thrower. peter . He 's in the body of one of those escapees . Which one ? Jesse . Does he have jesse 's ability ? If he does , he doesn 't know what it is . Police have called in s. w.a. t. teams and hostage - Is he ready ? Police have made several attempts to make contact ... That 's a the japanese I know . What are you guys looking at anyway ? Go away. we were here first . You can 't call dibs . Can too. dibs . Why are you doing this ? Do you want the world to end ?

Hiro takes his job very seriously . And what are you , like , his sidekick ? Partner . Like robin to his batman . I understand what you 're doing . Hiro 's my best friend . We will never leave each other 's side . Hiro ? Is is my life . I mean , it happened exactly like this . Future can only be the future for so long . Then it becomes the present . Except for this one . I - i don 't remember this . This must be my future future . It was . But not anymore . The future has ... Changed . Yeah , changed to what ? Come on . You can 't just tell a guy that his future Is changed and not - Hey , man , come on . Are you even listening to me ? So what if he doesn 't show ? He always does . He 's like santa claus . And then we 're gonna get our payback . I don 't think I want it anymore . I sat in a cell next to you month after month . This is all you talked about . One-stop shopping , revenge , and retirement . About being free . I never told you but you gave me hope . Probably saved my life . Yeah , but we 're free now . Why do you wanna tempt fate ?

Yeah , I bet you can 't wait to get To your family and friends in detroit . Yeah , exactly . Except jesse 's family 's from vegas . And he ain 't got no friends . So who the hell are you ? You do realize she 's playing us , don 't you ? This is all one big game to her . Maybe . But aren 't you curious to see how it all plays out ? So how do we do this ? " we " do nothing . I take care of the escapees and petrelli . That sounds like a one-sided partnership . We 're not partners . You just stay close and keep your mouth shut . Who the hell 's in charge around here ?

You 're waiting out here . Well , what 's that gonna protect you from ? Nothing . It 's for show . And you 're going in without your gun to ? Knox wants me unarmed . He says he 'll release the hostages . You do realize they 're not gonna let you out alive ? Well , that 's very touching . A monster cares about my well being .

Just a guy with a partner standing right behind you . I told you to stay put ! You told me that to make sure I wouldn 't , didn 't you ? What 's this supposed to prove ? I 've walked through fire before and I haven 't gotten burned . You 've never been burned ? I 'm indestructible . I can 't feel pain . You ever suffocate ?

You know , I just thought that since - You don 'get to do that . Think , about claire . That 's me. not you . I 'm the one who 's been here . Changed her diapers , checked her spelling . Me , not you . Sandra , I 'm not trying to - Do you think this is a game ? She just got attacked . - Hurt . - Yeah , that 's right . And she 's looking to push back . And there 's nothing you can do to stop that . In fact , smother in her , That 's the best way to drive her way real quick . Don 't you ever assume to know anything About me and my ughter . I just did what I thought was best to keep her here . Safe . I got it . You ready ? One second . I totally forgot about the cheerleader sleep over retreat . I 'm sorry . Is it ... cool ? Sure .

I can eated you No , I don 't think it working Here . Try this . And as the search for self continues We look for answers everywhere . In nature . In god . In tiny tragedies that may never be understood . But still , we are driven to it . Single-mind on one goal . To find our purpose on this earth . No matter what the ramification ... The friendships that may be hurt ... Or the deals with the devil we need to make . I guess you were wrong about me . We 'll see . Am I being replaced ? Only for a while . Just until I find his weakness . And then I 'm gonna kill him .

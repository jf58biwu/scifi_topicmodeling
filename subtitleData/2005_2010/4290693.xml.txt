 You are about to take a trip back in time to a world that existed before " Prehistoric Park " . This is an epic adventure into the minds of the team who dared to imagine the impossible . Journey with us through the making of " Prehistoric Park " and learn the secrets of the series from the people who refused to let sleeping dinosaurs lie . " Prehistoric Park " is not a zoo . " Prehistoric Park " is like the ultimate Wildlife sanctuary . A sanctuary Where We 're not just bringing giant pandas back from the brink , We 're looking after extinct animals , so it 's the most incredible Wildlife conservation project . There 's an adage that conservationists use Which is " extinction is for ever " , so We turned that on its head and thought , " What if extinction didn 't have to be for ever ? " What if you could bring back the creatures " that We 've lost over the billions of years since life began ? " Then you think , " how do We bring them back " and how do We look after them ? " Once the big brains had the concept for the series , it was time to find an explorer to cope with perilous environments , who could deal with being charged at by a massive dinosaur or ten . That person was Nigel Marven . Every zoologist Would love to go back in time and since I 've been knee-high to a grasshopper , I 've thought how fantastic it Would be to see dinosaurs . I love living reptiles , but imagine finding a Deinosuchus , a 65-foot crocodile , amazing things that lived in the past , and to bring them back to the present day , every naturalist 's dream ! But the team now had what seemed like an impossible obstacle to overcome . How on earth were they going to travel back in time ? ( James ) Einstein made a big deal about space and time and time-travel . I think in reality he knew really like We do now that it 's quite simple . You just need a stick With lights on it . You stick that in the ground , the time portal comes up and you go back in time . So that 's What We did . Come on ! Come on , T-Rex ! ( Roars ) Once the team had the Nobel Prize winning , time-travel solution in hand , they had another tricky task . They had to find the perfect location for " Prehistoric Park " . We recced lots of zoos and sanctuaries to get our ideas . It Was important that the " Prehistoric Park " audience don 't feel sorry that these creatures have come from open landscapes 65 million years ago to a tiny little pen , so We Worked hard at creating a place We thought prehistoric animals Would like to be . What it needed Was a sub-tropical climate . Lots of the creatures Were reptiles that rely on external sources of heat . We needed the right mosaic of habitats With big cliffs surrounding the Park , so if animals did escape , Which , fingers crossed , they Won 't , they 'll be kept in by the geography . These unusual creatures would have unusual problems . Who would make sure they stayed healthy ? They advertised in a proper veterinary journal - it Was in With all the other job ads for a horse vet and a dog vet . It said , " Do you Want to be a dinosaur vet ? " I thought it Was quite cool . If looking after their wellbeing was going to be hard , running the Park would seem to be impossible . With thousands of tons of lizard heading their way , the team needed an actor to play Bob , the park-keeper . Can you get a ten-foot pole at the bottom of the paddock ? Check everything cos it 's home to a dangerous creature . What sort of person Were they looking at to play Bob ? There 's a question ! I think they Wanted someone ... good-looking , suave , debonair . No , With avuncular qualities , somebody Warm With an interest in the history of the dinosaurs , someone With a genuine love of animals of all sorts , someone that liked the outdoors , that liked the sweltering heat of South Africa . Just basically me , I think ! It 's not always totally serious around Bob . Things go Wrong around Bob and he has to run around fixing it . So With Bob We used to play a bit . Bob the park-keeper would deal with creatures like the troublesome Titanosaur and Matilda and Terence , the tricky T-Rex . You 'd have to be very brave to look after two baby T-Rexes . They 're very hungry because they 're growing so fast , so they need a lot of food to grow . They 're constantly looking for an easy meal and an unwary park-keeper might make a good snack for a baby T-Rex . But what was Nigel going to rescue ? The team had to decide what the viewers would want to see in " Prehistoric Park " . They had the luxury of choosing from the past 500 million years . ( LoW-pitched cries ) Choosing the animals for the Park Was difficult and a real joy for me , but We Wanted the famous extinct creatures , the Sabre-toothed cats , T-Rex , the ultimate predator . T-Rex is the most famous dinosaur of all time because it 's thought to be the largest ever predator . Anything With teeth 30 centimetres long Will catch the imagination of people interested in the fantastic and the terrible . We also thought We 'd spin in a few different ones . Some of the latest research is into dino-birds found in China . There 's this crazy thing called a Microraptor With four Wings . No one 's ever seen these things realised in any form at all . It Was a chance to say , " This is brand-neW to science . Let 's see What they 're like . " It was like a prehistoric detective agency in the production office . The researchers and directors were reading all the latest papers and were speaking to the key experts to piece together the life and death of the stars of the show . Palaeontologists have many different clues . Starting With the fossil record , We have the bones , the skeletons of the animals . We can look at those and compare them With those of living animals . We also have some indirect lines of evidence coming from " trace fossils " . Trace fossils are non-body remains such as footprints , eggs , burrows and even prehistoric poo . Nigel travelled to Scotland to find out more . There 's two rows of tracks here , one along here and the other one down here . This is 36 centimetres Wide , so it must have been made by a large animal . This is a real Scottish treasure . There 's not many of these in the World . No , there 's only a handful of this age . It Was made by Arthropleura , a giant extinct millipede . I think of these things as Palaeo-Polaroids or snapshots in time of the activities of these animals . We 're seeing preserved on this surface a fleeting moment of What happened 300 million years ago . These ancient creepy-crawlies were C-List celebrities . But this was about to change as they earn their new-found status as the rock stars of " Prehistoric Park " . But before any of these became 3-D creatures , they were trapped in a 2-D world on one man 's drawing board . ( James ) At the beginning of the process , We sit around With our fevered imaginations and think , " What animals do We bring back , What are they gonna do ? " Imagine a dinosaur getting pregnant or a mammoth needing a haircut ! " LeWie , the storyboard artist , takes these mad thoughts and turns them into something people can understand . ( NeW speaker ) Storyboarding is one of my favourite parts of the process because it 's there that you 're making the programme , the film . It 's actually a time Where you can throw in as many ideas as you Want and if you 've got a talented storyboard artist like We did , When you get the boards coming back to you and you look at them , you think , " This is how We 'll film it and how it Will look . " If you 've got a document you can go back to every now and then to remind you What you 're supposed to be doing Without any ambiguity , it ensures that you 'll get What you knew you Wanted in the first place , Which can so easily start going awry in the chaos of filming . One by one , Nigel 's extraordinary adventures were coming to life , from the hot swamps of the Carboniferous to the freezing temperatures of the ice Age . ( Trumpeting ) ( Marven ) Programme two , very exciting for me , Woolly Mammoths . We know a lot about them because they Were preserved in the permafrost . They only became extinct relatively recently , 1 0,000 years ago , and you can find out about their DNA . Palaeontologists believe they are very close in their social behaviour to elephants . But building a mammoth was not as simple as dressing an elephant in a hairy coat . They had to come up with a more controllable beast . To create animals from nothing you need something . We used animatronics , Which is a life-size puppet . So they turned to a company called " Crawley Creatures " , experts in hi-tech rubber models of all shapes and sizes . When I first saw the animatronics ... Sorry , squeaky chair , start again ! When I first saw the quality of the animatronics , I Was stunned . The skill , the quality , the sculpture , the electronics that go into operating them is breathtaking . There 's no magic any more . They can do it. lt 's brilliant . Sightings of the rubber dinosaurs were reported around the globe , from Chile and Florida to Brazil and South Africa . Wherever they went , a team of operators followed . Not only did they have to look good , they needed the right moves . I think even a slower move round and more of an amalgamation of different kinds of moves on her . So push her forward a little bit , move her , rock her . Martha the Mammoth Was mostly computer animation , but there Were some moments that she had to be an animatronic as We Were looking for an interaction . - Action ! - ( Man ) Wag your ear ! The elephant was led up towards the animatronic mammoth which was hidden until the last moment . ( Kelly ) The handler told us the elephant Will ignore the animatronic mammoth or go crazy ! We Waited With baited breath and then something amazing happened . The elephant believed our mammoth Was real and she stretched out her trunk and tried to interact With her . Everybody believed that Martha , just for a little moment , Was really real . 1 3 animatronics were used throughout the series , but the majority of the creatures were created by computer graphic geniuses working at " Framestore " . ( James ) We 've Worked With " Framestore " in the past When We did " Walking With Dinosaurs " and by Working With them together over the last six to eight years , We 've kept pushing the boundaries about What you can do With factual programmes . The " Framestore " team needed environments , so the directors spent months filming nothing , but doing everything to build this fantastic world . To create a shot With computer animation in it , you shoot a back plate , an empty shot Without animation . If you Want a moving shot , you have to not just shoot a single back plate , but shoot several back plates , to sew them together and move through the shot . In this shot We put a pole in With a little ball on the top , just to give Nigel an eye line . If the actor 's looking in the Wrong place , you don 't believe the shot . So in this case he 's looking at What Will soon be Martha . ( Marven ) You imagine you 're looking a Woolly Mammoth dead in the eyes ! ( Arthur ) Acting With nothing is unusual , but you get used to it When you 're doing it every day . You sort of have to build your own World , Which all these fantasy creatures live in , this invisible World . Come on , it 's time to meet your public . I knew I could do it . I think I had the temperature too low , but these two have finally hatched out . The rascals are following me everywhere ! I Was the first thing they saw and they think I 'm their mam ! I do talk to my dog at home all the time , so I talk to them like I talk to Frankie . Tuck in ... Steady now , come on ! Don 't bolt your food . If you eat that quickly , you 'll get Wind ! It 's not easy being a mother ! That 's What I did and it seemed to Work . It 's a Triceratops ! We 've done it ! Our first dinosaur , look at him ! He 's magnificent . Hold it , hold it , calm down . While Nigel and the actors were imagining what the creatures will look like , back in London the " Framestore " team are starting to build the creatures and bring them to life . When We build our creatures , We start With a physical maquette , Which is sculpted . It is important for everyone to see What We 're looking at . This maquette is scanned in using a laser and the information is transferred onto computer . Once that comes in , you build an internal skeleton to make the Whole creature move and this allows the animators to animate freely . Once the scanning is complete , the animators take these virtual beings and breathe life into them . This is where the creatures take their first few steps and eventually run , jump , fly or swim . It 's like taking hold of a creature and just posing it in certain Ways , taking a snapshot of that and moving the time slider on . Similar to stop-frame animation , but We don 't have to redo it each time it 's filmed . We can re-import these positions on to other creatures . But a very strange creature was complex to animate and even harder to pronounce . Parasauro ... lophus . Parasaurolophus . Parasaurolophus . Parasaur ... olophus . Parasauro ... Parasaurolo ... phus . Parasophalus . Parasauro ... Parasaurolophorus . No . Parasaurolophus . No , it 's not in my programme ! The Parasaurolophus might have moved in a number of Ways . It mainly Walks on two legs . The hind legs are massive , but the front legs are not so strong . ( Glasbey ) What We believe it does , and What looks very natural , is it Will Walk on four legs . A similar gait to a camel because of the structure of the creature , but once it gets up to speed , it Would shift its Weight backwards , lift up and then run on its back legs . It Would be a very strange creature to run on all four legs . It looks like they Would get tangled up . But not all of their walks made it into the programme . But to make it look real , you have to have physical interactions . You have to have the creature looking like it 's kicking something or kicking some bones on the ground , so We shoot physical interactions . ( Bennett ) ln the new Zealand shoot , episode 3 , We had an actor , Morgan , and We have a scene Where he 's attacked by the Mei Long , Which are these vicious dinosaurs , like a pack of Wild dogs . And for that interaction We actually had to pull him backwards through a hedge . Aagh ! Aagh ! Aagh ! Aagh ! Aagh ! Aagh ! Help me ! We did about ten takes in the end and this poor guy is getting pulled through clean off his feet about six foot by this enormous stunt co-ordinator and that interaction is What these programmes are all about . You imagine you are standing next to enormous dinosaurs and it 's amazing how quickly our actors and presenters get into that . Aagh ! Aagh ! Help me ! They 're after the food . Get your bag off ! Get off ! Help me ! Aagh , get off ! Aagh ! Help ! Aagh ! Aagh ! Help ! Oh ! They 're away ! ( Snapping ) While the directors were filming in exotic locations , the sound designer was shut in a small , dark room in London , making and recording strange noises . A lot of the time We don 't have any sound at all , so We have to make the Whole thing up from the Word go . It 's exciting , but it 's also hard Work . ( GroWls ) We take a dinosaur Which has no sound recorded on location and We can give it our own special touch , so to speak , With obviously a bit of authenticity entwined With it . ( Thumping ) Big Whack if We Were creating the T-Rex sound . See What you have to do for your job ? ( Crunches ) That 's biting the bones and What have you . You 've got to have good teeth for this job and do other horrible dinosaurs . Back on location , thousands of elements were being filmed by the directors and fed back to " Framestore " . The magic is pulling these pictures together in " compositing " . In this next sequence Nigel gets chased by a Tyrannosaurus Rex and runs right past a pen of crocodiles . It Was dangerous to have Nigel running past them , so We shot them separately . There they are . And I made a lot of noise off-screen to get a reaction for When the T-Rex runs past . We then shot Nigel against a blue screen and then put the elements together . Then in the finished shot We had a footprint , a bit of stuff being kicked off . A bit of camera move , a bit of shake When the T-Rex 's foot hits the ground . Putting these shows together is like a giant jigsaw puzzle and in the final scene , that amazing chase When Matilda the T-Rex escapes , she runs past crocodiles chasing me , that Was done in South Africa . The next shot We cut to Deinosuchus , the prehistoric crocodile , erupting out of the Water and saving my life by distracting Matilda . That Was done in Australia , so you have to think about how the stories flow together . They can be shot in many locations . The Deinosuchus was one of the creatures Nigel was really looking forward to meeting . I 've done a lot With living crocodiles and alligators . The largest crocodile alive today , the saltwater crocodile , is 25 feet long , but just imagine deinosuchus , a crocodile 60 feet long ! That 's a crocodile that actually hunts dinosaurs . ( James ) Every time We do CG Work , We push the boundaries more . And I think one that 's definitely causing them cause for some concern is this crocodile roll We 're doing . It took an enormous amount of preparation . It shows you What goes into CG . Nine , ten months before the shoot , We Were having hour-long meetings about how to achieve this shot . ( James ) lt 's something We never tried before , showing a giant crocodile rolling in the Water as it does a death roll . This could get the prize as the hardest shot in the programme . The Deinosuchus roll . We 've been dreading it ever since We saw the storyboard , how We 'll film it and composite the Whole thing . The interactions are very difficult With all these splashes . ( Thompson ) To make things even harder for Sirio , I shot it in sloW-motion , so everybody can stare in loving detail at every frame . The shot 's not quite finished and my fingers are crossed that it Will come out OK . ( Sirio ) People ask , " Do you have to do stuff frame by frame ? " It gets Worse . Sometimes it 's pixel by pixel ! It Would be easier if We had a 50-foot prehistoric crocodile to film for real ! But there Wasn 't time ! But finally , the Deinosuchus was ready to rock and roll ! It 's leapt out there . The Parasaurolophus is being dragged back . ( Groans ) ( LoW-pitched cries ) With the deadly Deinosuchus roll complete , it was time for the icing on the prehistoric pudding . Composer Daniel Pemberton spent a year in a flurry of staves , crotchets and quavers . He worked with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra to tell an epic musical story that would guide us through 300 million years of prehistoric life . Making " Prehistoric Park " Was an amazing experience . Sometimes it pushed us to the limit . We Were in very difficult conditions , dealing With real animals , CG animals , actors , hostile climates , long hours , but I think What We 've made is really , really special . " Prehistoric Park " , What a roller-coaster ride , 1 50 days ' filming ! Of course , you rarely see anything until you get back here . It 's so realistic . I 've always Wanted to travel in time . It 's a dream come true to see myself With these prehistoric creatures . When I 'm an old man , I 'll believe I travelled back in time . What We hope We 've shown With this series is extinction doesn 't have to be forever . What is " Prehistoric Park " ? Ask me another one . That 's too hard . ... to the location We Wanted to ... ( Phone rings ) The phone 's down there , is it ? Hello ? No , she 's not . Certainly the tractor scene Where We allow the ... the , er ... Tyrannosaur ... Was it the Tyrannosaur ? For example , on the tractor , When We let the ... I 've forgotten its name again ! Each one of our story ... Eugh ! It 's quite hard. I 'm always on that side and it looks so darned easy ! now I really know how hard it is !

 Doctor Jackman , where are you ? Gone away . The most powerful creature on the planet is what I 'm looking at . He 's capable of anything , if he can get away with it . Mr Hyde , don 't play these games with me ! He 's got a knife . Minimum necessary force . You understand me ? My neck on the line . My personal neck . - Mrs Jackman ? - Good morning . It 's complicated . Either you 're my mother or you 're not . Rules of estrangement . Do we kiss now ? I 've forgotten . Bad news . I 'm not in love with Dr Jackman . Good work , Mr Syme . You 're welcome . You are a direct descendant of Dr Henry Jekyll of Edinburgh , correct ? - Yes . - And yet he had no family , correct ? Yes . Then how can anything be simple ? How 's Mom this morning ? Nobody in or out ! One door ! Where is she ? There 's a woman called Katherine and she 'll contact you . Help her . - I won 't stop fighting him . - Then he will kill you . Then I won 't die . I have a wife and children , I won 't die . I didn 't get any sleep , Daddy . That means you didn 't get any sleep , either . That 's body-share for you . Tired , Daddy ? Oh , bet you are . Bet you 're tired as anything . Close your eyes , Daddy . Let me drive . Trash one more hotel room and I can chain both your feet . When you sleep I will eat your children . First we lose Tom Jackman , then Mom just vanishes . We checked the video footage to see how she got out . It had erased itself . All gone . We checked the security log to see who opened the door . What do you know ? Erased . " But that 's impossible ! It 's magic ! " And so I 'm asking ... how did she get out of the cell ? I don 't know . Did she walk through the wall ? That how she did it ? Did she walk through the wall , Pete ? I don 't know . You ... Well , let me explain about walls , Pete . Come over here , let me show you . It 's OK , don 't be scared . You see this wall ? Let me explain about walls ! Oh , for Heaven 's sake , that 's enough now ! Walls stop people ! And you stop now . My daddy once said to me a long time ago , " Son , stop hitting me . " I said , " Daddy , stop getting up . " It 's OK , it 's OK . He 's finished now . Come on , up you come . That 's good . OK . Now ... you get yourself down to the nurse , get yourself cleaned up , and find someone to fire you . Don 't talk to anybody about this , otherwise we 'll do whatever it is we do to people . Probably a bit unpleasant . I mean , er ... you know , I mean , I 'd try not to find out . Sorry to be a bit vague , but , er ... do take that in the general area of a threat . OK , well ... off you pop . Quickly now . What the hell 's the matter with you ? Bad day break ahead . You know how it is . No , I don 't know " how it is " . Well , then , I 'll tell you . She 's coming . We fucked up at the zoo , we lost Mom , and guess what ? Hmm ... we can 't find Dr Jackman , and she is coming . If you want to keep your balls where you can reach them , start praying we find that son-of-a-bitch before she gets here . Mr Syme . Sleep , Tom . Sleep , darling . It 's OK . Close your eyes . Sleep . Sleep . Come on now , love . Close those eyes . Hang that head . I assume she looks a bit older now . Older ? No , not at all . She looked like that . Exactly like that ? Yeah , like that . That photograph is 15 years old . Well , she doesn 't look a day older now . Well , that 's not really possible , is it ? Sadly . Well , you could put a little more work in , dear . So , she 's lasting well . It happens . Oh , she 's lasting amazingly . She 's dead . Died 15 years ago . That 's one way to halt the ageing process . She 's not dead , though . I met her . I checked it out . All the records agree . Dead . Well , then she faked it . Or somebody did . - It 's very difficult to fake a death . - Yes , I tried it once . But that was more of a boyfriend thing . Oh , I had boyfriends once , dear . No idea I was a lesbian till Miranda explained it to me . Could have knocked me over with a feather . Which , oddly enough ... Moving on ... To fake a death properly you need limitless funds , friends in high places , and a spare corpse . It 's a virtual impossibility . Now , add to that fact that Sophia Jackman apparently hasn 't aged at all in fifteen years . Well ... Well , obviously she 's not a ghost , is she ? Now , why are we eliminating that possibility ? Because there 's no such thing . Katherine ! Your current professional engagement is working as a PA to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde . From now on , there 's no such thing as " no such thing " . Wait there , I 'm just going to get the tickets . The machine 's outside , can you see it ? I will be outside . Don 't pick your nose . Mister ? - He 's fine . - What did you do to him ? - Nothing . - What did he do ? - I didn 't do anything . - Get away from him . - Sweetie , what did he do ? - Where did the other man go ? What other man ? Darling , there was no other man . Where did he go ? Sweetie , there wasn 't another man . I was just there , I 'd have seen . I won 't let him hurt you . I won 't let him hurt anyone , I promise . - Hello ? - It 's me . - It 's him . - It 's him . Don 't say where you are . Are you on a train ? Yes . - They know we 're listening , then ? - They guess . So , how are you ? Any visits from our friend ? I try to avoid him . - How ? - Staying awake . - A train ? - You 've been awake for a whole week ? Jesus , a train . - So what , a train ? - He 's on a cell phone ... Tell him to hang up and switch off the phone now . - Ssh ... - Katherine ! Just a minute . The longer he 's constrained , the worse he gets . - Yes . - He 's like a dog , you need to run him . If I let him run , he will run to my children . You don 't know that . Who told you that ? - I did . - Will you please tell him to hang up ? He 's just making threats . He saved Eddie 's life . He 'd have killed him too , for a laugh . You don 't understand . Maybe you don 't . Katherine , I can 't let him free , he 's trying to take over ! Dr Jackman , hang up and switch off the phone now . Tell Katherine I 'm sorry I shouted , I 'll be fine . Tell her not to worry . Dr Jackman ... Oh , damn it ! You could phone him back , if it 's important . He 'll have withheld his number , he 's not that stupid . He 's exactly that stupid . Come on . - Come on . - But he 's hung up . Doesn 't matter . Phone 's still switched on . If you can be texted ... you can be tracked . How long have they been able to do this for ? Well , I know where that blonde on reception lives . And I know you know too . Track Jackman and you 're rehired . - I was fired ? - Mentally . Where are you ? You 're on the wrong end of that question . Probably , yes . You 're not at home , I tried . I 'm in a friend 's house , OK ? Staying over . For Christ 's sake ! Are you all right , Tom ? What 's happening ? - What are you doing ? - What does it matter ? It doesn 't . - Are the boys there ? - No . Where are they ? Why do you assume it 's not a man friend I 'm staying with ? I don 't . Would it matter if it were ? How 's Eddie ? Still drawing his daddy fighting lions . He thinks you 're a superhero now . What happened in there ? So where are they staying tonight ? They 've got their school trip tomorrow , I couldn 't bring them . - They 're staying with ... - Don 't tell me ! - Tom ... - Don 't tell me where they are . Don 't tell me where you are , either . I love you . Close those eyes . Hang that head . Drift away with me . Claire ? Look at you . Look at my poor baby . Sleep . Just sleep . I can 't . He 'll go to our boys . He 'll take our boys . The boys are safe with me , love . Leave the boys to me . You 're him . Get away from me , you 're him ! Of course it 's me , Daddy ! Who else lives inside your head ? But don 't I scrub up nice ? Just let go . Let me dream for you . I know what you want . I know what you like . I 've peeped . - Sleep , Daddy ! Sleep with me . - Get away from me ! My , my , Daddy ! Where did that come from ? I do declare , I 'm all a-flutter . Don 't speak to me out of her mouth ! Don 't you ever do that ! What 's so special about her ? Whiny little Claire . Oh , Tom ! Why have you left me , Tom ? Oh , Tom , come back to me . Oh , Tom , I 'm so sad , and so wronged , and so lonely . Don 't I always dress nice ? Love me , Tom . Don 't you get sick of that shit ? Don 't talk about her ! Anything else , don 't talk to me about her ! She met me , you know . Looked right at me . Didn 't see you . How thick is that ? Lois Lane with half a brain . Don 't , don 't . Just stop , just stop now . Why ? I 'm asking . I 'm serious . Tell me , Daddy . What 's the big deal about Claire ? The big deal ? What ? You want to know how I feel about her ? How it feels to miss her ? You 're inside my head , take a look ! What is that ? What is all that ? Nothing you 're ready for , stupid child . Go ... away ! Got him . He 's moving . Of course he 's moving . He 's on a train . You really don 't have the hang of England yet , do you ? Find out about that train , I want to know every place it stops . - I didn 't think he had a mobile . - He must have picked it up somewhere . We 're going to have a location fix on him any second . Are you ready to go ? - Are we ready ? - Final checks , five minutes . Two ... minutes . - You 're leaving ? - Yes . - I was about to say a few words . - The facts are not unconnected . I was just going to inspire the troops . Well , make up your mind . See , you 're being funny there . That 's ... that 's you being funny , but I don 't mind , you know ? I ... I enjoy people with a sense of humour . Well , we enjoy you , too . I see , er ... the blonde in reception isn 't working tonight . So perceptive . Safe home . Don 't bump it . Don 't bump the corners ! OK , people . Listen up , English people . You know what tonight is ? Tonight ... is the orgasm . Tonight is everything this organisation has worked towards ever since it began . Since it was a desk . Tonight is the culmination of over one hundred years of planning . We have in our hands one hundred years of the dreams of brilliant men . We have at our disposal some of the most advanced , some of the most expensive technology the world has ever seen . What we do not have are any excuses . This is going to be bigger than America . Dr Jackman is coming home . Now ... look at me . Look at my face . Tonight ... nobody ... no ... body ... screws up . And in this organisation , when we say nobody , that means you . Over a hundred years . Millions of dollars and no screw-ups . Go ! - Thanks for that . - No problem . I 'm , erm ... always forgetting mine too . Enjoyed our chat . Me too . Get your men ready . We got him . She isn 't worth it , by the way . - Who isn 't ? - Whoever put that look on your face . Dump her , you 'll feel like a different man . Now me ... I always feel like a different man . Yeah , that 's my problem too . Claire ? I 'm home . You all right ? It 's me . I 'm coming over to see you . By the time you hear this message , I 'll be there . I have questions , old friend . Tom ? Expecting someone else ? The question is , are you ? Drink ? - No . - Do you mind if I do ? Are your daughters here ? No , I think they 're in Bulgaria , or one of those countries . You have company , though ? Yes . I hope you didn 't disturb her . Scotch ? - I said I didn 't want a drink . - You might change your mind . Oh , you 've got no idea . Oh , I 'm afraid I do . Still that girl from reception ? My guilty secret . Which , apparently , everyone knows about . Know the feeling . Yes , I imagine you do . I 'm surprised to see you here . Bit risky , isn 't it ? You know they 're looking for you . Oh , I 've ... taken precautions . Of course I 'll be there . Just a bit late , that 's all I 'm saying . There 's a lot of helicopters about this evening . I thought we were friends . Yes , that was the idea . So ... - What 've you discovered so far ? - I 'm not in your classroom now . Then how will you ever learn ? There really was a Dr Jekyll . In Edinburgh , in the 1860s . - A genius and a visionary . - Who experimented on himself . - Courageous too . - And turned himself into a monster . A monster ? Be objective . Turned himself into ... someone else . Well , more than just " someone " , surely ? - A demon ? - A superman . - Ha ! That 's you being objective ? - No , no , no . The human species no longer evolves , remember ? We change the world , it no longer changes us . But at what cost ? The millennia pass and Homo sapiens remains unchanged , century after century . And then one day , Dr Jekyll drinks from a flask and what do you know , there 's life in the old girl yet . - I never drank anything . - You don 't have to . It 's part of your inheritance , your birthright . - Because I 'm his descendant ? - Clearly . - But Henry Jekyll had no children . - Correct . I can 't be his descendant . - Correct again . - Then how come I ... Did you do that ? Was that you ? Happens when when I 'm holding him in . Interesting . There was some contention the change might generate a low-level electrical field . I 'm afraid I was sceptical . Do you mind if I make a few notes ? I 'm not a bloody experiment ! What on earth gives you that idea ? Who 's following me ? - We are . - Who 's WE ? Who do you think ? The Institute ? Klein Utterson , the people I worked for ? Klein Utterson exist to follow you . You are its sole purpose . Is anything in my life not a lie ? Not much , Tom . I wasn 't even really making a note . - What are you doing ? - A very powerful sedative . - Count backwards from ten . - You idiot ! You bloody idiot ! Sit down and let it happen . There 's nothing you can do . Tom , for God 's sake , this is pointless ... Listen to me ! What sends me to sleep wakes him up ! You just committed suicide . - How long have I got ? - You should be under by now . I 've got good at hanging on . - Sit ! - What ? - Sit on it ! Sit ! - What ... what are you doing ? Rope . I need to find rope . - Tom , this is pointless . - On the chair ! I won 't let you tie me up . I know how dangerous he is . - He 's an animal . I 'm dangerous ! - What are you doing ? - Sit on the chair ! - A knife ? You 'd never use it , Tom . If Hyde wakes up now , a knife to your throat , he 'll think it 's Christmas , sit on the chair ! Tom , this is crazy . What are you ? - The wine cellar . - What ? - It locks ? - Yes . It 's secure , it could contain him . What , you 're going to lock yourself in ? If I let Hyde go free now , he 'll run to my children . He 's already been to see them . He didn 't do them any harm . He tried to save Eddie 's life . That was before I locked him up for weeks . Why would you do that ? Because they 're my children , my family , my life , and he 's not taking any of it ! - Key ! - Er ... desk , top drawer . Come on . - What are you doing ? - You 're coming with me . - You don 't need me . - I don 't trust you anymore . You 're locking me in with Hyde ? - Yes , I know . - I 'm tied up ! This is inhuman ! - Any minute now . - No , listen to me , Tom . - They 're tracking your phone . - I don 't have one . They 're tracking somebody else 's . - Hello , help ! I 'm here ... - Hello . It 's me . Naughty old me . Who is this ? Who would be following you ? From the train , remember ? I 'm the guy lent you the phone . Hello , Mr l-Have-That-Problem-Too . It 's Mr I Can-Take-A-Hint . Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! You could have killed me ! Yes , and this is my good side . Hello ? What 's happening ? Is everything all right ? Run ! Run for your life , run ! Get away from here . Oh , God ! Help me , please ! Can anybody hear me ? No ! - No ! - Eat your children . - No ! - Eat your children ! 4-7-4-8 . - Who 's that ? - Him . He got the combination . Tom , listen , I ... I need to hide this where he can 't find it . - Tom , Tom ... I need you to ... - Open ! - What ? - Open ! Open it ! Open ! Open . Swallow . Swallow . Swallow it . Swallow . Gone ? - How will we get out of here now ? - I hope you 're regular . You ... You were on the floor . How did you ? I was calling for help . She heard me and ? I 'm really sorry about this . I never meant for this to happen . But ... - she was worried , I asked her over ... - Who ? Tom . What 's wrong ? - What are you doing ? - Claire . Don 't look . Please . Don 't look . Tom ? Tom , are you all right ? Hi , honey . I 'm home . Hello ? Hello ? Hello , can you hear me ? Stay still , I 'm going to get help . Don 't move ! Don 't move . - You 're hurt . - What ? You 're bleeding . I don 't think it 's my blood . What happened to you ? I don 't know . Now , Daddy , this is so much better . Wine , a woman , a tied-up old guy ! OK , not sure about that last one . Tom ? " Tom ? " Tom 's gone , honey . Dr Jackman has left the building . It 's the night shift . Mrs Jackman ? Oh , Daddy . You are spoiling me ! Haven 't fucked anything in days . Seriously , a gust of wind and I 'd go off . So ... I hope you don 't have any plans that involve walking straight . You either . Where 's ... where 's Tom ? You just missed him . Peter ? Peter , what is this ? What 's happening ? You wanted to know where your husband goes . This is where he goes . I 've met you . You 're Billy . You 're Tom 's cousin Billy . Lovely to see you again . How are the kids ? Wh ... Where 's my husband ? Your husband 's standing right in front of you . My husband is Tom Jackman . - Tom Jackman is also Billy . - No ... He 's both of them . How can he be two people ? You saw it happen . How can you be two people ? What are you ? I thought I married a man . You miscounted . Claire , be careful . Never try to hit me , Mrs Jackman , when I haven 't eaten . It 's just a tip . Keep away from me . Keep away from me ! You are going to be fun . Let 's find somewhere more comfortable . - Did somebody lock us in ? - You did . Oh , Daddy ! No ! OK . Where 's the key ? Come on , come on . You must have seen him . Where 'd he put it ? You got the key ? Where is it ? Thank you . Where 's the key ? You 've been dribbling . Now , why have you been dribbling ? Did my daddy make you dribble ? Clever Daddy . You know what ? I think I 've found the key . Arrest you ? What would I be arresting you for ? There 's been a murder hasn 't there ? - That 's why you 're here . - Yeah . Then , arrest me . It 's Jackman . That 's a recorded feed from a security camera inside Syme 's house . - And the phone we 're tracking ? - In the woods somewhere . Doesn 't matter , that 's him . Awesome . Tell them no one goes in till I get there . Fantastiche ! Tom , no . For God 's sake , Tom ! Tom 's gone , love . Tom 's asleep . Strange as it may seem , I am on your side . Oh , that 's nice . Thanks for that . Listen to me . You 've never killed before . Jackman wouldn 't let you . Are you sure you want to start ? You think you can do it ? - You 've never killed before . - Stop me if I 'm doing it wrong . - Listen to me ! - Oops ! Nearly forgot . Anaesthetic . Count backwards from ten . Oh , dear , Mrs Jackman . It 's going to take a bit more than that with me . Fine ! I 'm your wife . Don 't ever ask me to hit you . Just a tip . - It 's the wrong key . - What ? It 's too small , it 's the wrong key . You fucking bitch ! You ... Husband , I have questions . - I 'm not your husband . - What , because you 've changed ? I don 't know what you are . I don 't know if you 're schizoid or a werewolf or the first man to discover PMT , but , honey , yes , you are my husband . So ... What the hell do you mean , you haven 't fucked anything in days ? - You 're not serious ? - Look at me . - I 'm not your husband . - You 're Tom Jackman . - No . We just share a dick . - Yeah , and it 's mine . - How many ? - How many what ? Girls , women , little boys ? How many ? - I don 't know . - You don 't know ? - I 'm not married to you ! - Yes , you are . Get used to it . How many ? I fuck . I go out , I fuck . I don 't count . Jesus ! What kind of animal are you ? Maybe if Dr Jackman was getting any , I wouldn 't always wake up with a hard-on . I try . He won 't let me anywhere near him . He can 't . He 's afraid he 'll turn into me . - Would he ? - What if he did ? Why would I turn him into you ? Oh , Mrs Jackman . You 'd turn any man into me . Are you flirting with me ? Don 't flirt with me . - I was your husband a minute ago . - That 's the problem ! Why 'd you have to go out fucking everything in sight ? Why didn 't you tell me about this ? I am telling you . The other you , the real you . I AM the real me . OK . Tell me this . Are you using protection ? I need to know . I have children . - Are you using protection ? - Yes , yes . He makes me . Great . Very considerate . Just lovely . - Ever consider using restraint ? - Too close , Mrs Jackman . Don 't put your hands in the cage . You threatening me ? Warning you . I spent an entire evening with you . You played with my children . Our children . Why should I be afraid of you ? Because I 'm not your husband , and I don 't know when to stop . Then why did you warn me ? - Your clothes don 't fit . - They 're not mine . Turn around for me . - What ? - On the spot . Twirl , husband . You 're taller than him . Bit slimmer . Younger . Maybe five years , maybe more . I remember that arse . - What else is different ? - Check here ... Dream on . What about ... memories ? Do you have his memories ? No . Bits and pieces , sometimes . Places and faces . I look at you and know exactly what you look like naked . - No , you don 't . - How can you be so sure ? You went elsewhere . You flirting with me , Mrs Jackman ? Torturing you . I think his name is Syme , and this is his house . That 's right . - You 're in his house . - Yes , I 'm in his house . - In that dress ! - He doesn 't think of me that way . - And what were you thinking ? ! - What ? - While you fucked half of London ? - I 'm not your husband ! Then , why are you jealous ? So how do you two work it ? How do you live ? Usually we have an arrangement . Recently he 's been chaining me up . - What changed ? - I found about you . - And the kids . Where you live . - And that worried him ? - I make threats . - Why ? - I don 't like being chained up . - Not threats you 'd carry out . Don 't come any closer , Mrs Jackman . I don 't know what I 'd do . When the light flickers , you look at it like it means something . - You 're quick ! - Why ? What does it mean ? I think he can hear your voice . I want to talk to him . He 's not strong enough to come through . What does that mean ? - Tom ! - Listen , no time . Syme 's one of them , you can 't trust them . You 've got to ... Got to what ? What do you mean ? - Stupid Mrs Jackman . - Don 't call me stupid . Thank you . Gonna need the key . - I can take it . - You won 't hurt me . You 're Tom Jackman , - I know you won 't . - I 'm not your husband . No ! - What have you done ? - It was your idea . - His idea . - You , him , same thing . - Stupid bitch ! - You threatened my children . - You 're not leaving . - I need the key . - You 're not going to hurt me . - I 'll get that key back any way I can . You 've never killed anyone before . You won 't start with me . If I 've never killed before , how do I know I wouldn 't enjoy it ? You are Tom Jackman . You would never hurt me . Oh , Mrs Jackman , I 'd hurt you . So , Dr Jackman , you killed your wife . Yes . But you don 't have any memory of the incident ? You just know ? I have ... episodes . Violent episodes . Keep me here long enough and you 'll see . You should put me in restraints . So you keep saying . We don 't deem it necessary . Please . For your own sake . Excuse me . Can I see my wife ? Please . I just need to see what he ... What I did . Please . - What 's wrong ? - Apparently you 're being transferred . Got to give me credit , I 'm one hell of a kisser . Didn 't really think you 'd swallow it . - What if I had ? - I had a back-up plan . - I don 't believe you . - You should . Tom . - Tom , what are we going to do ? - I 'm not Tom . Oh , you 're Tom , all right . You 're just ... I don 't know ... sick . Some weird new kind of sick . I don 't think they 're gonna find a cure for it soon . Do you ? We don 't have to . There 's been a cure for over 50 years . Mrs Jackman , would you please step away from Mr Hyde ? Gentlemen , could you lower your weapons ? I 'd hate to be taking back a corpse because one of y 'all sneezed . Thank you . Good to see you again . How are you going to take me anywhere when I know you can 't shoot me ? You see that 's a funny thing . We really didn 't expect you to become so attached to Dr Jackman 's family . Now there 's ... there 's a weakness , Mr Hyde . Are you threatening my family ? Hello , it 's me , Benjamin . The word is , " go " . I said , are you threatening my family ? Excuse me for a moment . Yeah . I am . Explicitly and directly and emphatically threatening the lives of Dr Jackman 's family . That 's all I wanted to know . There now , Benjamin . It 'll be over in a moment . It 's all right . Hush , now . Count backwards from ten . I 'm sorry , Benjamin can 't come to the phone , right now . - Aah ... - Mr Hyde . Don 't want you to move . Please . - You have orders not to kill me , right ? - First casualty of conflict , orders . As far as this conflict goes , I 'd say Benjamin might beg to differ . Can 't tell you how fast I am . But I 'll tell you this . First one of you starts getting nervous , starts pulling that trigger ... dead . Then I 'll have a gun . That 's the next two ... dead . Third one kills me , then dies of his injuries . So what you guys have got to ask yourselves ... is this ... How much did I like my boss ? I don 't think you 're faster than a bullet , but then I 'm not supposed to kill you . And personally ... I couldn 't stand the guy . Mmm ... Mrs Jackman ? - Yes ? - I 'm sorry ... but I did like it . Ssh ... Can I call you ? Gentlemen ! If any harm should come to Mrs Jackman , I will kill all of you one by one . And I shall take my time ! Hope you find a nicer boss . - No problem , we 'll pull him in . - Don 't bother . He 's got blood on his hands . Hyde 'll run , but Jackman will return . Well , Benjamin seems to be dead . I think we should probably ... tidy up a bit and , er ... I don 't know ... phone the police . Anyone got an aspirin ? Can I see my wife ? Please . I just need to see what he ... What I did . - Please . - Apparently you 're being transferred . Tonight is everything this organisation has worked towards ever since it began . - Have we met ? - Friend of a friend . Tonight is the culmination of over 100 years of planning . Claire ? - Get it open . - What is it ? We have in our hands 100 years of the dreams of brilliant men . - Get him in . - What is it ? No ! No ! No , what are you doing ? What 's happening ? Dr Jackman is coming home . No , for God 's sake , no ! Please ! For God 's sake , no ! Please ! Claire ! No ! You have some questions . A few , yes . You have my husband in a box ! Off you go . Might as well get started . I 'm going to say this again . You know there 's no guarantee . I want to speak to Winston Churchill . What if your friend has the cure for cancer ? - What then ? - Shut up ! Shut up ! I married Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde ? - Yes , you did . - I 'm Mrs Jekyll and Hyde ? What are you ?

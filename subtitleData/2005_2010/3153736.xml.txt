 ( mohinder suresh ) the sun rises on a new dawn . yet few of us realize the debt we owe to those responsible for this . to those who dwell among us , anonymous , seemingly ordinary , whom destiny brought together to repair , to heal , to save us from ourselves . if evolution can do this for even the smallest of creatures , then why not these human beings ? if someone here ... found out about me , what would happen ? when will they stop ? I don 't know . ( sylar ) she 's a shiny new toy , and she 's all mine . ( suresh ) and they 're still out there , among us , in the shadows , in the light . we pass them on the street without a glance , never suspecting , never knowing . do they even know yet ? that they are bound together by a common purpose , a glaring reality , to be extraordinary ? teleportation , tissue generation ; these are no longer simply theories . I have seen them with my own eyes . and when destiny does anoint them ... my name is hiro nakamura . i 'm from the future . how do they hide from it ? you may feel confined here , but this is far freer a cage than the one they 'd put you in . ( mohinder ) how long can they dwell in the shadows before either fate or their own flawed humanity draws them out into the light again ? and how will they know what awaits them when it finally does ? and not only are these special individuals among us , they bear a curse . a virus which strips them of their powers and leads to their eventual death . in the last few months , I have discovered what I believe to be a plague . a plague which targets only these unique individuals . it 's a disease which threatens to eradicate them all . and in doing so , deprives our species of its evolutionary advancement . without this advancement , the challenges of the modern world : global warming , terrorism , diminishing resources , seem almost insurmountable on our thin shoulders . the fate of humanity itself hangs in the balance . but with proper funding and research , we can stop the advancement of this disease . I urge each and every one of you to take up this cause , spread the word , and fight those who would keep the world from the truth . thank you all for coming . [ scattered applause ] inspirational lecture , dr. suresh . I was wondering if I could trouble you for an autograph . your father would 've been so proud . so would your sister . who the hell are you and why are you following me ? this isn 't necessary . i 'm nobody . what , you think I didn 't recognize you ? you 've been at three of my lectures . yeah . the company sent you to bag and tag me ? is that it ? a year ago , I would 've run , but not anymore ! well , that 's good , because if you had , I wouldn 't be able to offer you a job . i 've been down that road before . it doesn 't end well . where will you go , dr. suresh ? no one even believes they exist . I found your father 's book in the parapsychology section in-between hypnosis and alien abductions . they don 't take you seriously . they all think you 're nuts . but not me . so if you 're really interested in saving the world , the least you can do is let me buy you a drink . [ labored breathing ] [ speaking spanish ] ugh ! [ breathing heavily ] [ speaking spanish ] all the electives I wanted filled up last semester . come on . it 's your first day . you should be excited .

I am shark bait . oh , you 're gonna do fine . they don 't look any different from the kids in texas . okay , except for her . so maybe they 're a little bit more ... sophisticated here , but you 're gonna fit right in . [ sighs ] if you say so . just remember what we talked about . I know . I 'm claire butler . I won 't slip up . it 's not just the name . it 's everything . trust me. the company is still out there . and they will find us unless we 're flawless with our plan . from now on ... you have to be entirely un-extraordinary . right . don 't stand out in any way . exactly . don 't raise your hand in class . and don 't even think about trying out for cheerleading . oh , come on , dad . that 's all behind me . just blend in . be ordinary , right ? you got it . you know , we might want to start by you not driving me to school . it kind of draws attention to me . ouch . and , you know ... don 't you think it might be easier on all of us if ... I had my own car ? your mother and i were going to surprise you on your birthday next month . but ... oh , my gosh . the rogue ? thank you , daddy ! oh ! it 's yours . you 're the best dad in the world . [ school bell rings ] I know . I know . claire . it 's just ... I just can 't help thinking about how many times i 've said good-bye to you on the first day of school .

I 'm west . claire . you 're new , right ? yeah . so what are you ? meaning what , exactly ? meaning are you one of them ... or one of the others ? I 'm not sure I know what you 're getting at . well , let me break it down for you . are you a robot or an alien ? 'cause everyone in the world is one or the other . robots do what they 're told . stick with the herd . aliens , on the other hand , do their own thing . well , uh , I don 't know . do I have to choose ? most people do . so what are you ? ( man ) okay , everyone . in the struggle for survival , it is the fittest who win out at the expense of their rivals . now who said this ? come on , people . journey of the beagle . evolution . anyone ? charles darwin . it 's charles darwin . easy one .

I 'm gonna do it this morning . uh-huh . and if I wasn 't here watching your every move ? [ slams punch card ] you know , you 've been here for a few months , butler . I think it 's time I saw some commitment to excellence from you . when I was assistant manager , we were fully set before the first customer walked through that door . that is how I got this . paper business is dog eat dog . you gotta live it and breathe it . you gotta want it . do you want it , butler ? do you ? yes , sir . yeah . well , we 'll see . the company was formed 30 years ago with a group of like-minded individuals , ordinary men and women who were gifted with extraordinary powers . they wanted to help their own . to find them and to protect them . we find people , and we make sure they don 't become dangerous . now sometimes that can mean making sure they understand entirely what they 're capable of . and teaching them to use their abilities for the good of mankind . and sometimes it can mean eliminating them . who the hell are you to judge who lives and who dies ? if I 'm not mistaken , you yourself tried to put a bullet in the brain of a man named sylar . he was a monster . yes . and you were willing to kill him for the greater good . you acted on a moral imperative to protect your species . it doesn 't matter one way or the other about sylar . he 's no longer a threat . he 's dead . and now you have molly . you and matt parkman are protecting her . now we 're not interfering with that arrangement . we have resources to offer you , dr. suresh . the plague . you talked about the disease which killed your sister , shanti . the virus . yes . we have the funds you need for your research . now , can you imagine what would happen if that virus mutated and crossed over into the general population ? look , the type of research you 're talking about is extremely expensive . trust me . that won 't be a problem . let 's just say we have our own private fort knox . so can we count you in ?

[ nervous laughter ] why would you ask me that ? reading the answers out of people 's minds , it 's unfair . no , it is my natural talent . you wouldn 't think a baseball player 's cheating 'cause he 's athletic , would you ? it 's not the same and you know it . no . you know what , I want to talk to you about these drawings that you made at school . you 're changing the subject . ms. gerber 's concerned and so am i . you don 't want to talk about your exams , I don 't want to talk about ams . molly .

I mean , I find a stout brute , put him on a horse , put him in a field , and tell him to shout on about how he 's fearsome old kensei . then I repair to the branch of a tree and start to pick off the black guards one by one . that 's fighting dirty ! that 's fighting smart , sir . what ? I give him a fair wage . if he lives . no. this can 't be . no . I come from the future . many years from now . your noble deeds become part of our history . the future ? yes . that 's a good one . no , it is true .

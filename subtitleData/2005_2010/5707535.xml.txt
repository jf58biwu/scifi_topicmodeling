Well , the shaman told me i 'd feel it here , nln my heart . Well , maybe the shaman was wrong . Maybe it was just last night 's chinese . You don 't know . It ain 't exactly science . This was like nothing i 've ever felt ! Look , you just had a heart attacknand didn 't die . Now , I thought whennyou met the right one , You were supposed to become mortal ... only after our souls are united . What the hell does that mean ? After you kissed her , nafter you slept with her ? After you 've done lamaze class - They didn 't give an instruction manual , ok ? I didn 't exactly meet her . I was too busy trying to breathe . So you don 't even know who she is . I know she was there . I know she exists . That 's enough . Not for you . You 're gonna try to find her . And when you don 't find her , nyou 're gonna get crazy .

I don 't hate you , amsterdam . That would take too much effort . Good . Today 's a whole new day . Missing persons ? Fingerprints , crime scene reports . It 's called police work . Someone needs to do it . She 's not a missing person . How do you know that ? Her boyfriend told me . We had a little heart to heartnin the subway . His name 's eddie riley . Yeah , he 's a primary subject . Nwhen 'd you bring him in ? I didn 't . He give you her name ? He had a train to catch . Look , don 't be cute . She deserves better . Yeah , you 're absolutely right . Where you going ? Police work . Someone needs to do it . Look , we need to set somenground rules here . You sound just like my last 609 girlfriends . I hate that smell . If dead bodies make you queasy , What are you doing in homicide ? Wasn 't my choice . I wanted to work undercover narcotics , But the powers that be refused my application . And dead bodies don 't make me queasy . I just can 't stand the smellnof formaldehyde , ok ? She have a name ? Yeah , we just don 't know it . Well , the bullet perforated the right brachio-Cophalic vein And the internal thoracic artery . Oh . What caliber ? Maybe a . 38 , close range . She has some random contusions , ndefensive marks . I also found what looks like paint underneath her fingernails . Sent it over to the lab . See if it matches anything over At the s . O.C. - Any chancenthe body was moved ? Lividity is inconclusive . I 'm sorry . I have a new baby . You need a deep male voice . Try putting on npr at 10 : 00 . Cool . Baby sleeps , and brushes upnon foreign affairs . I like that . Then there 's this . The penmar . An underground club . You knew about this how ? It used to be a speakeasy during prohibition . Same name , same spot . Nypd . We 're trying to id a young woman . She had the club stamp on her wrist . Lots of girls come in here . Any that look like this ? Whoa ... what happened to her ? That 's what we want to know . Hold on a sec . You knew about this being a speakeasy , nhow ? I used to drink here . I think your dead girl is likensome wannabe celebutant . Chloe carlton . She 's the one . In all of time , There is only one personnyou were meant to be with . We feel this . We know it . But we do not know how to find the one . What was so important ? The y is supposed to be closed . It is . And you 're naked . Right again . Surveillance from chloe 's bank . She withdrew 10k from her account The morning she was murdered . That 's the guy I chased . Eddie riley . Santori 's put a wan card out on him . She also deposited a checknfor the same amount From a pawn broker 6 days ago . Only question is ... what is she selling ? Great thing about new york - Pawn shops are open all night . Why narcotics ? Most cops would kill to get into homicide . It 's after the fact . Digging through the pastnisn 't going to bring anyone back . I 'd rather be on the front lines . Why homicide ? I like to solve puzzles . And it intrigues me . What does ? Death . Likes to play hard to get . I 'll see you tomorrow . You have a good energy about you , eva . It 's true . I felt I should say something nice . So there it is . Best yankee pitcher in history , guidry . Gossage , the goose . Guidry won a cy young award . 25 and 3 in ' 78 . Red ruffing . What do you know about it ? I know his curve ball droppednlike it fell off a table . All you could do is wave at it . Hey , lone ranger , nyou know that guy you let get away ? Eddie riley ? Before he went into the army , He was no stranger to the system . G.L.A. , burglary , assault . Not murder . Nyou want to up your clearance rate Until we nail the right guy . If they 're innocent , they don 't run . Riley 's our boy . And when I find him , he won 't get away . He 's right , you know . All signs point to eddie . He could have shot me . He didn 't . I saw it in his eyes , he 's not a killer . What 'd you find ? Pawn shop keeps a photo log . Nthis is what chloe sold , Vintage , deco-Style , platinum and diamonds . Bezel and bead-Set stones . Could be 4.5 carats . You learn that from onenof your 609 girlfriends ? One of my wives . Plural . How many have you had ? Only one at a time . No way eddie gave her this . I 'd like to know who did . Hello ? Mrs. Carlton ? I 'm detective amsterdam , This is detective marquez . We 're sorry about your loss . Get out . Please . We know how hard this must be for you . You know nothing . You 're a child . Ni have work to do . We need your help , mrs . Carlton . Nwe need it now , Because i 'm not lettingnwhoever did this walk away . Will that bring her back ? She was my heart . You have no idea what i 'm feeling . It 's just words until it 's happened to you . He was 6 , my son . Well , almost 6 . It 's pain without end . Do you know who gave chloe this bracelet ? She ran with a rich crowd . Dated toby hardwick for a while . Hardwick . As in hardwick hotels ? Never liked him much . A rich boy through and through . Broke up a couple months ago . Any idea why ? She 'd met someone new . Eddie riley . She said they had something real . And now she 's gone . How do I go on ? Thanks . Right here . Mr. Hardwick ? Excuse me a moment . Hi , you must be detectives ... amsterdam and marquez . Pleasure . Let 's step over here for a moment . Thanks for coming out here . We have preliminary inspections all week . Another hotel ? Low-Cost housing for 300 families . With dreams comes responsibilities . So , how can I help you ? Chloe was a good friend of our family . We haven 't been able to contact your son . Toby ? He 's on a skiing trip . He 'll be back for the funeral . How long has he been gone ? A couple of days . Why ? He 's not a ... suspect , is he ? What can you tell us aboutnyour son 's relationship with chloe ? They went out for a while . Nothing very serious , I don 't think . Who would have given her a $ 10,000 diamond bracelet ? I don 'u know . That 's a lot of money . I suppose my son is very spoiled , My fault . We work to give them everything , And then they don 't knownwhat to do with it . Look , toby may be many things , Some of them not very attractive , But he is not a killer . Madagascar red , Manufactured in italy until the 1940s . This is what was found undernthe victim 's fingernails . Artist-Grade paint , Banned for its toxic lead content . But what 's revealing is the medium used . The artist added water-Washednlinseed oil laced with gold leaf . Gold leaf ? It was a marker . An artist 's unique signature . Can you date it ? Based on the molecular deterioration , I would say 1930s . So if chloe scratched a paintingnbefore she died , Then she probably wasn 't killed at eddie 's . No madagascar red there . That means the body was moved , nmaybe by eddie . Or someone who wanted to frame him . That painting could be anywhere . It 's gonna be a very cold trail . Not if you know the painter . My mother seldom worked on canvass . She was more known for her onsite murals . She painted them all over new york ... private homes , hotels , Libraries . They called her one ofnthe first graffiti artists . The paint really does shimmer . That is what made her work unique , She mixed it with gold . Did she keep any records ? She was an artist , not a bookkeeper . But you could try asking her . I thought your mother passed away . No , she 's still here . Sometimes , that is . The alzheimer 's plays havoc . Hello , julianne . Hmm ? I wanted to ask you about your work . You 've seen it . Oh , many times . You used a pigment called madagascar red . Did i ? I remember alizarin crimson , Such a lovely color . What about madagascar red ? It 's-It 's so long ago . It might have been for a special commission . Please , julianne . It 's important . Yes . For the lover 's sacrifice . I painted that mural , you know . I know , I know . Where did you paint it , julianne ? They won 't let me take walks anymore . Nthey ... they 're worried i 'll forget my way home . Sometimes it 's better to forget . But you remember your work , don 't you ? Do I know you ? Not anymore . She painted the mural innthe presidential suite Of the davenshire hotel . The eavenshire ? Sold in the eighties to hardwick hotels . Toby hardwick had access , but motive ? We need evidence . We have to get into that suite . I 'll get a warrant . Charlie ? You think I wouldn 't remember you ? You think I wouldn 't remembernwhat we had ? I 'm so sorry . This happens sometimes . It 's ok . Let her be . One day you left . You just left . I gave up so much for you . Didn 't I mean anything ? The thing of it is , I knew you were going to leave me . I knew it the first day we met . Ever ask yourself why a vampirenhas no reflection in a mirror ? Not this week . It 'd be too painful . To see himself year after year , Century after century , Unchanged while everythingnaround him grows old . To search for love but know it 'snalways just out of your reach . Because to be human is to die . To die is what makes life worth living . It 's god 's joke . What about the girl in the subway ? There were probably a couplenhundred women on that platform . Maybe she was the one , maybe not . Maybe she was on her way tonthe airport and is long gone . It 's all maybes . Maybe it 's a sign that i 'll never find her . Your desk is done . Newly painted . The killer 's standing here . There 's a struggle , He hits her , She falls against the wall here . Shouldn 't we wait for crime scene ? Absolutely . Got the blood work back onnyour disappearing corpse , And it 's a mess . Hmm . No , this must be a lab error . These numbers don 't make sense . I mean , the hemoglobin level 'snover the moon . 120 micros of lead ? That 's enough to kill someone . Yeah , and check out the blood type . It 's this rare form of rzrz . It became extinct when certainnnative american tribes disappeared . So , somebody 's pulling our chain ? Hope so . Ok , but how did toby remove the body ? I mean , there must bensecurity cameras everywhere . You know ... this guy kind of looks like you . You think ? What the hell ? It was common for turn ofnthe century hotels To build secret entrances to their best suite . Toby could have known about this . Took a chance . That 's years of bad luck . Only 7 . Let 's bring him in . No ! Ok . Ok , there 's no way I reserved that room . You 're name 's on the register , You 've partied there before . Ncome on , toby ! I don 't care , I wasn 't there . There 's no way that you cannprove that I was . That 's enough . Counselor . Mr. Hardwick is my client . I suggest that if you intend to charge him , You do so . Otherwise he 's leaving with me . I don 't need someone to talk for me . I 'm not 5 years old . Be quiet , toby . Look , there 's no way I couldnhave killed chloe . She 's my friend . You were jealous because she met someone else . Yes , I love her , but not like that . Well , then how ? You don 't strike me as the platonic type . My father 's here , isn 't he ? Is he-Is he watching ? Toby . What if I could prove thatni wasn 't at the hotel that night ? You don 't need to say anything . I 'm in love with someone else . I was with that person the nightnthat chloe was killed . Yeah ? We need her name . I can 't do that . You can if it 's true . Ok . His name is brian shaw . I guess we all have secrets . That 's what keeps us in business . What do you think his father 'snsaying to him ? He 's telling him he loves him . Aw , a romantic . I can read lips . And you 're also deaf , I suppose . It was temporary . Normandy . A shell exploded too close to comfort . Sorry I asked . Talked to toby hardwick 's boyfriend And verified his alibi . I told you , eddie riley 's our guy . Don 't take it too hard , hotshot . Even red ruffing lost a few . I just heard from mcmanus . He found eddie at the penmar . Turns out his brother-In-Lawnruns the place . He 's been hiding out there . Santori 's on his way to pick him up . Get in . What happened ? Tried to run . Guess he thought if it worked once , nit 'd work again . It didn 't . He 'll be all right . Found this on him - A.38. Nice work , tony . Brought this one home . I 've been doing this a long time . You got good instincts , john , But sometimes uhings are what they seem . Thanks . That 's a good lesson . You didn 't buy a word of that . Not true . He said I have good instincts . What do your instincts tell you now ? Same as before . Eddie didn 't kill that girl . But if he 's innocent , why did he run ? Why didn 't he give himself up ? He comes home , finds chloe 's body . He tries to save her , ngets blood all over him . The cops show up . He knows what it 'll look like . He has a record , body 's in his place . Now , who 's gonna believe him ? So he picks up the gun and runs . Then who did it ? The only other person withnaccess to the suite , The only person who would havenknown about the secret entrance . Peter hardwick ? Interesting theory , but it would helpnto have a motive . It 's more than a theory . Hardwick was having an affair with chloe . How do you know that ? His son implicated him . When ? I was there , ni didn 't hear him say that . I didn 't say I heard him . I 'm not sure lip reading 'snexactly admissible . Hey , eddie . You 're the dude who chased me . I thought you were dead . I was . Now i 'm not . Lucky me . I don 't want to face anothernmurder charge . I don 't think you killed her , eddie . I think you loved her . You ever been in love ? I 've ! Loved . I 'm talking about something else . I 'm talking about ... feeling like you 're drowningnwhen she 's not there . Did you ever feel that ? No . Well , that 's what we had . You know who killed her , eddie . But you don 't trust the system . You think the game 's rigged , right ? Yeah , well , i 'm here , aren 't i ? Well , too bad you won 't have the chance To do something about it . Doctor said you 're well enough To be transferred to central booking . Put on your pants . Hey , spare 2 bucks ? Talk about inflation . Sorry , buddy . How about 3 bucks ? Keys . You don 't want to do this . Shut up ! Cuffs and car . Come on , ncome on , come on . Been a while since we didnsomething like this . It feels good . Ok , let 's see where he takes us . What are you doing ? What do you want ? Do you know who I am ? Yes , I do . Yes , I do . You 're eddie , eddie riley . Yeah ? Eddie , listen to me . That 's right Listen to me very carefully . I 'm a very rich man . Ni can do things for you . What can you do for me ? Ncan you bring chloe back ? Eddie - Shut up ! Eddie , please . Please , can we just talk ? Shut up ! Shut up ! Get down on your knees ! Ok , ok . Get down on your knees ! Please , i 'll give you anything you want . What are you gonna give me ? What ? Like the bracelet that you gave her ? She hated it ! She hated it ! It was a handcuff . Admit it . Look at me ! Admit it . I want to hear you say it . I swear it was an accident . She said she was gonna leave me . And then things just got out of control . I 'm sorry . So you shot her , And you dumped her body in my apartment Like she was trash ? ! It just went off . Eddie , please . Eddie . Put it down . The gun 's empty . It 's over . No one gets to die today . Thought you were gonna wait for me . Yeah , I lied . You ... you didn 't have to come . Actually , I did . I , uh , thought you might want this . Yow asked before how you go on . You do what you can . You go to work , you see your friends , You cook food , get up in the morning . Aod one day , it changes . Don 't know why , it just does . It 's definitely an original benwaar . And in impeccable shape . May I ask where you found it ? Goodwill . Then you 're the luckiest man alive . Tell that to my bookie . How 's 15,000 ? Bout this benwaar fellow , I did a little research on him on the internet . His last desk sold at auction For 87,000 . I could go to 60 . Done . Thing about great art , It 's timeless . It 's as if the artist Was speaking to us today . Smoke ? Oh , i 'll pass . Sure ? It 's afzal molasses tobacconinfused with peach resin . That stuff will kill you . Mcmanus told me what happenednto your last partner . Said you had a death wish . Really ? If we 're gonna be working together , We have to trust each other . You don 't need to worry about that . You won 't be herelong . Your application to narcoticsnwasn 't denied . Your father buried it . He wanted to protect you . You can reapply in 3 months . I will . And you 'll get in . But why ? Who are you trying to impress ? Only you , amsterdam . You don 't need to . How did you find out about this stuff ? It 's what we do . We bring closure to people who need it . You seem to need it . Closure . It 's what we all want . You will not grow old . You will not die ... until you find the one And your souls are wed . How will I know when I find her ? You will feel it , here ... in your heart .

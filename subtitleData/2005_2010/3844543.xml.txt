Only thing up here is boonies , man . Oh , man , Duke . We gotta get off the road . Fuck no , Duke . Fuck no ! You got a better idea ? All these years we pissed away at Nixon 's farm waiting for this ? And this is the best you 've got ? I never thought we 'd catch the damned thing . We can 't trust them , Duke . Wyatt 's the only one who knows about these things . Oh , we all know about these fucking things . DUKE : Not like Wyatt . Fucking bullshit ! Not like Wyatt . Fuck this shit . ( gasping ) HOPE : Wyatt ? Baby , go back to sleep . There 's nothing out there , baby . There never is . CODY : This is fucked , Duke . otis : They 're gonna come looking . We can 't just stand out here in the open . Get back in the van . Well , the thing 's in the van . ( banging ) DUKE : Wyatt . Fuck this . ( banging ) Wyatt , I know you 're in there , Wyatt . Look ... I know you don 't wanna see us . I understand . But me and the boys , we got no choice . We 've been out to Nixon 's farm , Wyatt . They 're after us . You know that better than I do . And I bet my ass you know what we got out here in this van . Get it ! Go get it ! Dadgommit , Wyatt , we need a place to hide . You don 't let us in here , we 're all gonna die out here . I know you , Wyatt . You won 't let that happen . You can 't let that happen , Wyatt . Not this time . The fucking bitch . What 's up , Wyatt ? That 's far enough . What is this ? It 's a chance to make things right . What 's in the tarp ? You know damn well what 's in the goddamned tarp . What the fuck did you boys do ? We took some action . But you wouldn 't know shit about that . Come on , Otis . The mask was my idea . The chains . Did you kill it ? It wouldn 't come without a fight . It 's lost a lot of goop , though . Is it breathing ? Is it supposed to ? Is ... God damn it ! WYATT : Shit . This thing dies , we are all in a world of shit . We kicked this one 's ass . We 'll kick some more . You ignorant shit . You kill it , and the rest are gonna come and put us down . And I don 't just mean us in this fucking garage . Get out of the way , Otis . You ready ? Yeah . HOPE : What the fuck is this ? Hope . It 's 1 : 30 in the morning . Yeah , it 's just business . Christ , Wyatt . What the fuck kind of business ? They got guns . One of them 's bleeding . Hey , Wyatt . You need me to put your woman in her place ? Excuse me ? Well , he don 't mean nothing , ma 'am . He 's just an asshole . At this point , I 'm gonna have to ask y 'all to get the fuck out of my house . Please , baby , let it go . It 's okay . Wyatt , you in some kind of trouble ? Nothing I can 't handle . What the hell is that ? WYATT : Please . I 'd do her . Just give me a minute . That 's all I need . What is that , Wyatt ? I 'll explain everything . Do I want to know ? Please , baby . You all need to get that thing back where you found it . But we think they 're coming after us . It ain 't my goddamn problem . Wyatt . It ain 't my goddamn problem ! Now , you listen to me . The longer you keep that thing , the more dangerous things get . I told you , he ain 't changed . Wyatt , just hear us out . I 'm not getting mixed up in your shit , Duke . I left this shit in the rear view a long time ago . It 's been 15 years , guys . So let this shit go . Fuck this pussy ! We 'll take it back to Otis 's and carve it like a turkey . The hell we will . My mom would shit . Pissing on these things ain 't gonna bring back Timmy . I ain 't gonna hide like a pantywaist from the sons of bitches that murdered my brother . You know , fuck it . You do what you want , but don 't do it in here . God damn right I 'm gonna do what I want , you sack of fucking shit . Cody ? What ? Come on . We 're all friends here , Duke . You gotta trust me on this one , Cody . Trust you ? Last time we did that , you made us look like ape shit . The whole town thought we gone retard , you asshole ! My own fucking father thought I killed my brother and buried him out in the woods . I thought it would be better for you . Better ? Better ? Fucking over your friends was better ? Telling the whole world we were lying ? Telling everybody we made everything up ? Guys ? I thought if people knew the truth ... Cody ! Cody . God , that 's enough , Cody . What 'd you think about that , dipshit ? Cody . Guys . CODY : Huh ? You 're worse than any fucking cocksucking piece of shit ! You got your money 's worth , now get the fuck out of my garage . ( SHRlEKlNG ) It 's awake . That 's good , right ? Wyatt , I think it knows you , man . Wyatt ? ( GRUNTlNG ) No . No . No . What 's it doing ? Fuck if I know . Wyatt , what 's it doing ? ( SHRlLLlNG ) DUKE : Wyatt ! Wyatt ! They 're coming back . Oh , hell ! CODY : This fucknut wants to take care of us ! We should make it to the van . otis : I mean , if they 're coming , we probably should make something ... Shut up ! Nobody talk . Nobody talk . What ? Oh , fuck that shit ... Shut up ! Shut up ! CODY : What the fuck ? DUKE : Shut up ! The man says shut up , you shut up , Cody . They 're gone , right , Wyatt ? It 's sending a signal . Hold it down . Hold it down ! DUKE : Hold it down !

Get something to cut the fucking thing . Come on , Duke , cut it ! Cut it ! That 's it . Come on , cut it . Cut it , cut it , cut it ! Cut it , Duke ! ( clicking ) ( panting ) It was trying to call the others . If it 's calling its buds , why aren 't we knee deep in these sons of bitches ? It must be damaged . Probably because of that goddamn ass-whooping we put on this motherfucker out in them woods . Probably . Best not to take no chances . How 'd you know , Wyatt , about the implant ? Call it a hunch . Keep the lights out and stay quiet , they might not find us . Take it back to Nixon 's farm in the morning . Be safer to travel in the daytime . Hey , do you think we all got one of those GPS clicker thingies in us ? Wyatt would know if we did . Hey , that clicker went off the second it saw you . What the fuck is going on , man ? Wyatt ? You think you could check me for one of them clickers ? HOPE : I don 't know what it is but how soon can you get here ? Wyatt , baby , this is a dangerous situation . Who did you call ? Wyatt ! Tell me ! She was calling the cops , wasn 't she ? Shut up ! I 'm out of here . Give me the keys . The hell you are , you fucking bitch ! Shut the fuck up ! Give me the keys , Wyatt . Baby , listen to me . I can 't let you go . Not until morning . Hope , I 'm trying to protect you . By holding me hostage . First thing in the morning , I will take you anywhere you want to go . I 'm on fucking parole . Fuck off , Cody ! You fuck off , Wyatt ! I ain 't going back to prison 'cause this crazy-ass bitch is losing it . You understand that ? If this bitch called the cops , I swear to God , I 'll cut her up ... DUKE : Damn it ! Baby . What 's the play now ? You always got the answer . Put the gun down , Cody . Always thought you were the leader . Some leader . Look at us . We 're all fucked up now . I guess Timmy was the lucky one , huh ? Lucky , my ass . You got no idea what happened to Timmy . Oh , that 's right , I have no idea . But you do . DUKE : Look , we 're all friends here , okay ? Let 's not do anything stupid . Just take a deep breath and calm down . Hope ! What are you doing , baby ? Give me that knife , Hope . She looked it in the eyes , didn 't she ? Fuck ! Easy . This ain 't gonna fly , Wyatt . DUKE : The thing 's got her . CODY : Don 't matter . She ain 't got nothing to do with this ! If that thing gets loose , we 're all dead . I know she 's your girl and all , but I don 't give a shit . No ! It 's playing with us . WYATT : Oh , don 't you shoot ! CODY : See that ! I 'm shooting . No . No . No . Cody . Hope ? Hope . Please , baby . This man will kill you . She 's fucking cutting it . Please , baby . Concentrate on my voice . What do you want ? He 's talking to it . You let her go ! The gun . Put down the gun , Cody . CODY : No fucking way . No ... DUKE : Calm down , Cody . Put down the fucking gun ! Please , Cody ! Come on , God damn it ! Jesus Christ ! Please , Cody , put down the gun ! No fucking way . ( screaming ) Stop ! Let go of her ! Let go ! God damn it ! Let go ! Baby . Hope . ( muttering ) Red line 's out of bounds . Nobody crosses it . No matter what . ( GRUNTlNG HOARSELY ) Damn , that looks infected . Might need a tetanus shot . Had one when I was seven , remember ? Oh , fuck . It 's deep . Oh , jeez , Wyatt . Oh . That works ? Hell if I know . You shouldn 't be out pulling some cockamamie stunt , Duke . You got a wife and kid . Pam left me four years ago . That ain 't shit . I 've seen worse . How many nights have you boys been out trying to catch one of those things ? Nights ? Try years . Probably seven by now . Fuck ! Damn , Duke . That 's some shit . It was either that or just go out drinking . Well , there was some drinking out there , too . Actually , after a while , it was pretty much all about the drinking . Got easier when Otis started hanging out . We could watch in shifts . Then numbnuts got out of prison . Fucking bear traps was his idea . Yeah , I could have guessed that . Going out to Nixon 's farm was just our way of coping . You been coping , Wyatt ? What do you think , Duke ? Shit ! Motherfucker ! ( GROANS ) Fuck it . God damn it . Ma 'am , I 'm sorry . I 'm supposed to put this duct tape over your mouth because of the ... I thought ... Wyatt thought it 'd be better . Have you told Wyatt to go fuck himself ? ( SNlFFLES ) We all know how it feels . Having one of those things inside you like that controlling you . It 's the worst fucking thing ever . It 's hell . It 's worse when it 's longer . They did it to us for days . Well , let 's hold off on the tape for now , 'cause ... God damn it . What the fuck ? God damn it . Oh . Oh , fuck me . God damn it . What the fuck ? What the fuck ? God damn it . Oh , fuck ! Oh , God damn . Oh , fuck . Please , no . Please . What the fuck ? Oh , fuck ! God damn it . Fuck ! God damn . Fuck . Oh ! Fuck . Fuck . CODY : Oh , shit . Oh . Come on , man . I gotta drop a deuce . Oh ! Come on , quit playing . Oh , fuck . ( MUFFLED breathing ) Wyatt , is this why you gave me so much shit when I wanted to move in ? Yeah . Good call . Honey , I never wanted to get you mixed up in all of this . You understand that , right ? You 're gonna have to give me a little bit more time on the whole understanding part . CODY : Get the hell out of my way ! I 'm not fucking around here ! DUKE : Come on , Cody . Calm down , man . This was your fucking plan . No , my plan was to catch it . And now what ? You want out ? Oh , you sad fucking sack . But there 's more at stake now than just us . Damned right . They killed my brother . Now , get the fuck out of my way , Duke . Cody . Cody , put that thing down . You 're not calling the fucking shots , Wyatt . Now I 'm not playing around here . I 've got business with this thing . And I plan on taking care of it right fucking now . Get out of my fucking way , Duke ! DUKE : Cody ! CODY : Get the fuck out of my way , Duke ! Fucking savages . DUKE : Calm the fuck down . I want answers , motherfuckers . Now ! Cody , this is some dangerous shit . Dangerous ? You wanna see dangerous ? You boys still think I 'm screwing around ? It bit me . Look at that . It 's spreading . Okay , we can help you . Duke . Not too close . What ? Listen , Cody , why don 't you turn off the torch and lay down , man . You seen it before . It 's bad , ain 't it ? Ain 't it ? It 's just a rash , right , Wyatt ? It 's just a rash , Cody . Oh , shit ! Get out of the fucking way ! This is between me and it . Put the torch down , okay ? We can fix this . We can get you to a hospital . Yeah . Yeah . I could be some college boy 's thesis project . I 'm not being a lab rat . Not again . WYATT : That ain 't gonna happen , Cody . Now just put the torch down . You see , Wyatt , that 's your problem . You always think you got a say in the matter . ( GROANS ) ( GROANS ) You see what happens when you try to fuck with me ? Come on . You see what happens , motherfuckers ? I dare you . Come on . Try that shit again , you motherfucking little pussies . Duke , don 't touch him . What about you , man ? Don 't worry about me . He 's not dead , is he ? I mean , I didn 't hit him that hard . No , he ain 't dead . Don 't worry . We 're just gonna let him rot away in there ? He needs help ... Nobody can help him , all right ? Now you stay away from him . That shit 's contagious . But you touched him . It won 't do nothing to me . None of this shit ever does . That 's what Timmy had , isn 't it ? When they took us . That 's what killed Timmy . It won 't take long . It 'll start eating him ... inside and out . He 'll watch his flesh peel away layer by layer . It 'll hurt so bad , it 'll make him insane . Dangerous . A few hours from now , he 'll be begging us to put a bullet in his head 'cause his fingers are hurt so bad he won 't be able to pull the trigger . Sweet Jesus Christ on the cross . Wyatt . Can I talk to you for a minute alone ? Hey , what about me ? You stay in there and watch the girl . Shit , Duke , I don 't want to be alone with that chick . She freaks me out . Sorry , Wyatt . DUKE : Just get your ass in there , Otis , please . Please . They let us catch it , didn 't they ? What the fuck are you talking about , Duke ? I 'm saying there is no way in Hades we could have caught that thing the way that we did . They just dropped that fucker off and sent him right to us . You 're crazy . I 'm sorry , Wyatt . I 'm sorry . I 'm such a fucking idiot . They knew our dumb asses would bring it to you . What the fuck would they want with me ? I don 't know . Maybe they ain 't done fucking with you yet . Have you ever wondered why you were up there the longest and came back with that clicker shit inside you ? I try not to think about that . Well , I think it 's about time you started giving it some thought . Fuck me . Oh , shit . Oh , fuck . ( knocking ON DOOR ) otis : What 's going on ? Nothing , buddy . I wish you weren 't lying . Otis , you keep this door locked and don 't let anything through . It 's loose , ain 't it ? DUKE : Just do what he says and secure the door . Maybe it 's gone . ( gasping ) Holy shit ! Oh , fuck . God damn it , Duke . It was over here . There 's fucking blood all over the place . Where the hell is it ? ( banging ON DOOR ) You stay down there . ( screaming ) Help ! HOPE : Help me , please ! ( banging ON DOOR ) sheriff : Wyatt , it 's Sheriff Henderson . Open up or I 'm breaking in . Get the fuck away from me . ( SHUSHlNG ) ( HOPE howling ) ( banging ON DOOR ) WYATT : Yeah , just a minute . Hands up . Easy , Sheriff . What 's with the lights ? The power went out . That happens out here all the time . sheriff : Oh , yeah ? Well , I heard voices . ( MUFFLED SCREAM ) It was the radio . Hoping they 'd say when the electricity would be back . So what 's this all about , Sheriff ? 911 call . Said you were holding a hostage . Is that right ? Yeah . An extraterrestrial one . What is it ? The third time this winter ? Fourth , I think . What , are you locking me in here ? No , it 's wild dogs been snooping around lately . I guess I could take care of some wild dogs . I guess you 're used to this prankster shit . Yeah . Anyways , we gotta check it all out . You know the routine . Especially since the call came from your phone . My phone ? Yeah . You been drinking ? Yeah , I had a couple . You mind if I have one ? I guess not . ( sheriff exclaims ) Good . What 's back there ? Nothing . You got a key ? Yeah , I got ... I got it right here . Shit . I stepped in something . What 's this ? A radiator leak ? Yeah , I guess so . WYATT : Listen , Sheriff , there 's something I need to tell you . I got a girl in there . sheriff : You got an alien groupie , huh ? No , she 's just a friend . I 'd like to meet this friend . ( breathing heavily ) ( SCREECHlNG ) ( screaming ) What the fuck ? What ... otis : Go away ! Wyatt ! Help me ! Shit ! Hold it . On the ground . I gotta ram it . I said hold it ! You 're gonna have to shoot me , Sheriff . Wyatt , help ! Wyatt ! Fuck ! On the ground ! Come on , Sheriff ! God damn it ! Please , Sheriff ! The next one will be between your ears . ( sobbing ) Otis ? Don 't move ! No , no , no ! Please , Wyatt , don 't move . It 's come here , Wyatt . I want my mommy . I want my mommy . I want my mommy . What the fuck ? Don 't move . No , no ! Don 't point the gun at it ! Point it away , God damn it ! Point it away ! Stay calm , Otis . Just stay calm . Stay calm . ( choking ) ( coughing ) ( screaming ) ( OTlS shouting ) Get the tape , Duke ! Make it stop ! Make it stop ! Oh , it hurts . ( GUNSHOT ) No , no , no , no , no ! Please make it stop ! Hold it down , Duke ! I 'm gonna kill you , you motherfucker ! You 're all right . You 're okay . I don 't think the duct tape 's gonna work this time , Wyatt . You 're gonna be fine . You 're gonna be fine . Just hold it together , all right ? Don 't look . Sheriff ? Sheriff ? Sheriff ? Shit . There 's a pulse . All right . I 'm gonna get you some help , okay , Sheriff ? Fuck that . Go get me a beer . All right . ( groaning ) Easy . How 's your friend ? About as good as you . All that shit about you and aliens was true , huh ? ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah . Shit . That 's fucked up . ( gasping ) You got anything harder ? Yeah . Yeah . ( CAR engine starting ) It 's not safe out here . Is it safe in there ? I 'm not going back there , Wyatt . Not until it 's dead . We 're taking it back where they found it . Otis needs help . We 're gonna take him to County . Kill it , Wyatt . Can 't kill it , Hope . I 'll do it , then . Hope . Hope ? Hope . Please don 't tell me it 'll be okay , Wyatt . If you tell me it 'll be okay , I swear to God I 'll fucking hurt you . Killing this thing will only make it worse . Worse ? Fucking worse ? Did you fucking see what it did ? Why can 't you be a man ? Why don 't you care ? I hate you ! Hey . Hey . I care . I care . ( sobbing ) Oh , fuck . You had the keys . You should have just gotten the hell out of here . I 've never been so good with " should 've " . Me neither . Me neither . We 're losing him . Cody . Cody . Otis is ... Otis is bad off . We 're gonna go for help , man . CODY : Always thought one day we 'd find Timmy . Take him back to town and have a fucking parade or some shit . That ain 't gonna happen , huh , Wyatt ? ( CODY sobbing ) I 'm gonna die with everyone thinking I killed my brother . WYATT : Nobody thinks you killed Timmy , man . The hell they don 't ! My own pop . CODY : If I had it my way ... I 'd take that fucking monster and drive it back to my pop 's little peach house , walk right past that motherfucking white picket fence , and drop that piece of shit alien right on that cocksucker 's doorstep . Ding dong . Oh , that would be good . I 'm sorry , Cody . My mom , she thinks I 'm working overtime . She 's gonna be all alone now . Oh , shit . Watch your fingers . Yep . Ready ? All right . He 's a heavy little fucker , isn 't he ? I doubled the chain . Let 's hope it stays unconscious . Yeah . It ain 't safe out here , Duke . DUKE : I can 't leave Cody . The boy 's my responsibility . Take care of yourself . Bye , buddy . ( CAR engine STARTS ) ( COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO ) What happens if we kill it , Wyatt ? You know what happens when an animal kills a human ? We kill that thing and they put us down . They put us all down . We kill one , they declare war on the human race ? Wouldn 't be no war . They want us gone from this planet , we are gone . The show is over , end of the human race . It 'd be a goddamned massacre . Wyatt , when this is over , I think I 'll move back to my mama 's house . Cody ? I 'm real sorry , Cody . ( KEY turning ) I 'm gonna make things right . ( HEAVY breathing ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ) Why 'd they come back , Wyatt ? They let the others go after the second night . And they tested us all , you know . But Timmy and I ... I guess Timmy and I passed the first round . WYATT : Timmy got sick real fast . Like his brother . But it didn 't take with me . So they kept doing more and more . They kept fucking with me . They altered me . Till one morning I woke up , naked , couple of counties away . They 'd sent me back with some sort of tracking device in my body . But I knew it was there because I could hear it clicking away . So I cut it out and went into hiding . I guess they want me back . They 're scared of you , Wyatt . When that thing was fucking around inside my head , I felt it . That 's why they came back for you . They 're scared shitless of you . Yeah , well , the feeling 's mutual . ( tires screeching ) HOPE : What ? What the fuck , Wyatt ? Shut up ! Shut up ! They 'll hear . How do you even know ... I can feel them . Where are they ? Everywhere . Lots of them . We can 't just sit here . It 's not safe out there ! Well , sorry , sweetie , but sure as fuck ain 't safer sitting in the middle of the road in this van with that thing in the back . Wyatt ? Wyatt ! Hope . Hope . This ain 't cool , Hope . Hope , this ain 't cool . That van will be our coffin . Otis is back there . Otis died ten minutes ago . That is not true ! Yeah ? Then check on him yourself . Hope , we should get back in the van . I am not hiding away for the rest of my life , Wyatt . That 's your thing . Hope . Hope ! WYATT : Otis ? Come on , buddy . Otis ? Come on , Otis ! Come on . Come on , Otis . Come on , boss . Come on . Come on . Come on , boss , stick with me . Come on , man . ( GRUNTlNG ) You son of a bitch ! God damn you , motherfucker ! Why 'd you pick us ? Why ? Motherfucker ! You like that ? You like that shit , huh ? Fifteen years ago , we were out on a hunting trip . You know all about hunting trips , don 't you ? Don 't you ? It was me , Wyatt , Otis and Cody . And Timmy . Yeah , you fucking remember . You fucking remember . You fucking remember that shit ! We were just kids . But Timmy . You remember Timmy . You killed our friend . Now you 're gonna pay for it . You 're gonna fucking die ! See what it feels like . Feel what it feels like . ( alien GRUNTS ) CODY : Duke ! Duke . Oh , shit . Fuck . Cody . Cody . Holy shit . What the fuck , Duke ? Shit , Duke . You 're not supposed to be holding me like this . Shit . It 's okay . ( GROWLlNG ) HOPE : We could go get help . You get help . I 'm going back . Take this , okay ? Won 't you need that ? No . Okay . I 'm gonna drive you back . No . You stay on the road and keep driving . All right ? You don 't turn back for nothing . I won 't leave you . I need you to do this for me , Hope . No , I won 't leave you . ( FOOTSTEPS approaching ) ( FOOTSTEPS STOP ) ( aliens breathing ) Duke ? Oh , no . ( coughing ) Duke . Duke . Duke . Duke . Hey , Wyatt . Duke . Where is it ? Where 'd it go ? It 's calling the others , Wyatt . ( coughing ) Duke . ( SHUSHlNG ) You run , Wyatt . Go . Duke . Duke . ( RUSTLlNG ) ( GUN clicks ) ( CREAKlNG ) ( alien growling ) Damn . Get off him , you fuck . Duke ! No ! ( groaning ) ( choking ) Duke ! You motherfucker ! You fucking bastard ! Why 'd you have to do that , you son of a bitch ? You goddamned motherfuck ... ( alien screeching ) ( rumbling ) ( SHRlLL ringing ) ( groaning ) How did that feel ? You ugly motherfucker . Cody ! How does it feel to be probed , cocksucker ? Cody ? Oh , shit , Cody . I ain 't got time for this , man . We 've got some serious company coming . Cody . God damn it , Cody ! You hearing me , Cody ? Please . Oh , God , Cody . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , man . I 'm sorry .

WYATT : Just leave Cody alone . And don 't hurt anybody else . And I 'll go with you . You 'll get a ribbon or something , you piece of shit ! No ! This is between you and me ! Nobody else ! I said call it off and I 'll go with you ! I 'll go with you ! I 'll go with you ! ( GUN fires ) ( gasping ) You 're not going anywhere with them . ( rumbling ) Hey , van 's down the road . Let 's go . Wyatt . Cody ? Cody . I got you . You okay ? Timmy was never really good with pain , was he ? He was a real pussy , wasn 't he ? ( sobbing ) ( CODY groaning ) I need you to do what you did to Timmy . I didn 't ... I didn 't do ... Please , Wyatt . You were his best friend . Please , Wyatt . ( CODY sobbing ) ( GUN clicks ) ( GUN fires ) ( THUDDlNG ) ( aliens SQUEALlNG ) Come on . Come on . Hurry ! Come on , Hope . Get in . Hope , get in . Come here . Cover your ears .

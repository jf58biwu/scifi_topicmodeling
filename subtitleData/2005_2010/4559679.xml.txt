 ECHO : Previously on Dollhouse ... I 've been many people . I can hear them . Sometimes suddenly . My name is November . The only reason Mellie exists is because of you . Remember our deal . The young lady 's freedom has been granted . Just because you leave our care , we don 't cast you to the wolves , Madeline . I 'm worried about you . There is nothing less than a conspiracy , spearheaded by the Rossum Corporation . I 'm sure he was looking for a cause . Someone gave him us . Prostitution , human trafficking , maybe murder . We 're gonna verify all this . We 're gonna find proof . We 've got better than proof . We 've got a name . - There is nothing to worry about . - Did security vet everyone ? Metal detectors , hand wands , the occasional frisk . Occasional ? Relax . The Rossum Corporation 's evil , not stupid . They 're not gonna try anything while the cameras are rolling . - You really aren 't nervous . - I 'm terrified . I 'm about to put an innocent woman up against one of the world 's largest corporations , and I have no idea how they 're gonna react . Remind me why I love you so much . - I 'm your white knight . - And I 'm your beautiful damsel . Ever after . Ever after the press conference . Ten minutes late , huh ? Good afternoon . In the past weeks , I 've made some serious charges . Charges of corporate malfeasance on the part of several medical research companies . Charges which will receive a full airing on Capitol Hill this week when hearings begin . At those hearings , you will hear a most innocent word . A word that will take on a new and grim meaning . A word that will become synonymous with human trafficking , prostitution , and unconscionable abuses of neural technology , directly traceable back to the Rossum Corporation . That word is " Dollhouse , " ( REPORTERS CLAMORING ) An urban myth that has become all too real . Where people have their memories erased and are brainwashed to do things that would appall the most cynical among us . Today , I want to put a face on this issue . I have a witness who lost three years of her life to the Dollhouse . FEMALE REPORTER : How is the Dollhouse connected to Rossum ? She would like to make a brief statement . My name is Madeline Costly . Three years of my life are gone . Stolen by the Dollhouse . They preyed on me when I was at my weakest and forced me to ... And forced me to do things , things I never would have believed , until Senator Perrin showed me evidence . I almost wish I hadn 't seen it , but then I wouldn 't be here . And there are still people being held captive by the Dollhouse . They don 't even know they need help . So that means we have to help them . MALE REPORTER : What do you plan to do ? We applaud Miss Costly 's bravery , and we ask that you respect her privacy throughout the inquiry process . Remind me why you released her from her contract two years early . It was an internal matter . Right . Something to do with keeping you from exposing this house to the public . Well , that worked out . ADELLE : Something obviously has gone very wrong , but the protocol at this house cannot be blamed . There has been nothing in Madeline 's reintegration into post-Active life - that would suggest ... - That she was about to go before a Senate subcommittee and start naming names ? I 'm not questioning your protocol , Adelle . It 's your judgment that 's become the issue here . There 's some concern you may have developed a soft spot for this one , like you did with Nolan 's girl . What was she called ? Sierra ? - How would you like us to proceed ? - By doing nothing . Rossum already has a plan in place to deal with Madeline . What the hell is that supposed to mean ? - Your house will be covered . - May I ask how ? It 's handled . That 's all you need to know . I 'm already late for a satellite tour where I get to run PR flack against this mess . Talk up Rossum 's good works . Our groundbreaking Alzheimer 's treatment . ( CHEERS MOCKINGLY ) - I 'll be sure to watch . - Well , we 'll all be watching . So , just how much danger is she in ? A former Active once made a passing reference to us in his blog . That was his last entry . So going before the United States Senate , that would be worse . - Considerably . - We can 't just sit by and let this happen . I have no intention of just sitting by . - He told you to do nothing . - Indeed he did not . I inquired how he wanted us to proceed , and given the context , I would call his response a suggestion . You framed it before he could tell you what to do . Madeline will not be testifying in front of any Senate subcommittee . She was quite happy when she left us . Now she 's not . She 's being used . - You have developed a soft spot . - You miss my point . She 's being used against me . Someone with inside knowledge has served her up to this crusading junior senator . So what 's your next move ? To discover what game is being played . ... practices , medical research ... BOYD : Daniel Perrin . Political family . Third in his line to becoming United States Senator . Started policing medical research just under three years ago . ... work these corporations do , but there must be accountability . The health of our citizens cannot be held hostage for profit . He 's a demagogue . Look at him . So concerned about the public , and when he shuts down all research , we can go back to leeches . - So why isn 't Rossum worried ? - Maybe they got dirt on him . - They would 've used it by now . - ECHO : November is sad . - Yes . Yes , she is . - We should help her . That 's just what we 're going to do . - She 's not right . - Yeah , we got that the first time , Echo . She doesn 't mean Madeline . ... only that it took that long . ( LAUGHS ) - I was sure the moment I laid eyes on him . - I couldn 't let her get away . She 's perfect . It 's like they made her just for me . I couldn 't let her get away . She 's perfect . It 's like they made her just for me . He 's not lying . At first glance , she 's perfect . At second glance , she 's still perfect . Skip to the part where she 's not . You look hard enough , you start to see discrepancies . Her parents ' Social Security numbers don 't match with their names . Her college transcript weighted her GPA , even though Berkeley doesn 't calculate them like that . - Forgeries ? - Some of the best I 've seen . Cindy Perrin is a doll . Harding was being modest when he said Rossum had a plan in place . - They 've been married for three years . - Long-term placement . She clearly wasn 't imprinted to dissuade him from going after Rossum . - She 's a sleeper . - An assassin , you mean ? - Like Madeline , when she was Mellie ? - Please . She didn 't kill you . Mrs. Perrin 's going to be activated when things get too hot . I 'd say things are warmish . Even Harding 's too smart to murder a sitting US Senator . But he wouldn 't think twice about having a sleeper assassin take out Madeline . It won 't come to that . You 're going to stop her before she gets to Madeline . BOYD : Senator Perrin moved them both to a safe house - by a security firm called Contratech . - Where 's Perrin ? His Senate team 's still working out of the downtown hotel where they had the press conference , the Commerce Plaza . He 's still there . So tell me about the safe house . Ten minutes from downtown , quiet residential neighborhood . The house is covered with surveillance . I 'm working on getting access to Contratech 's servers . Just give me the address . I 'll go get Madeline . It will be a touch more difficult than playing cat burglar , especially if Cindy Perrin is there . You 'll need to understand what it is you 'll be up against . ( MADELINE SCREAMING ) That 's my apartment . Mellie . Once a sleeper Active 's protocol has been triggered , the thing you 're facing will be neither reasoned with nor stopped . - MADELINE : Oh , God . - ( PHONE RINGING ) PAUL ON VOICEMAIL : Leave a message . ADELLE : There are three flowers in a vase . The third flower is green . ( HEARN GROANING ) I get the idea . Madeline easily dispensed with a man twice her size . Cindy Perrin will be no less capable . Any sympathy for Mr. Hearn would be misplaced . He was a serial rapist . I wasn 't thinking about him . MADELINE : Last time I was at the Dollhouse , he seemed so kind and gentle . You can never tell what monsters people are hiding inside . - Like me ? - Why would you say that ? I killed someone . For the rest of my life , - I 'm going to know that I killed someone . - You didn 't do this . The Dollhouse did . And that 's why you 're gonna testify against them . ( PHONE RINGING ) Hello ? How are the two most important ladies in my life ? ( CHUCKLES ) You 're sweet , Daniel , but I can 't talk . Madeline 's having a rough time . Go . Take care of her . I 'm gonna stay here at the hotel and go over the financials with Burt if you need me . - Remind me why I love you so much . - I 'm your white knight . And I 'm your beautiful damsel . Ever after . What is it ? It 's the thing that if it doesn 't work exactly like it should won 't get me in trouble . ( CLEARS THROAT ) I call it a disrupter . That 's not too Star Trek , is it ? TOS ? Hmm ? It 's based off what I could deconstruct from Alpha 's remote wipe tech . This is the same tech that turned Echo into a serial killer ? We said we wouldn 't dwell on that . He 's dwelling . Just continue . You push this button and it sends a neural-electric feedback loop through the bio-links implant , disrupting the cranial architecture . - Lf the frequency is calibrated to match ... - Topher , less tell , more show . Mmm-hmm . - Hello , Kilo . - Is it time for my treatment ? Isn 't she so cute and tiny ? I love it when a doll 's name is so on the nose , because she weighs one kilo . It 's a unit of measurement ? - ( SIGHS ) So alone . - I enjoy my treatments . Yes , we know , but you probably won 't enjoy this . ( LOW HUMMING ) The gentle hum lets you know it 's working . The side effects include headache , bloody nose , and the uncontrollable urge to ... That . It 'll knock out any doll in a 10-foot radius , including a pesky sleeper like Cindy , without actually harming real people like us . ( TOPHER EX CLAIMS ) Make that a 50-foot radius . Good . So I 'll drop Mrs. Perrin and I 'll pick up Madeline . ( TOPHER STAMMERS ) - What ? - You 're more right than you know . If Madeline is in range , it will bring her down as well . I thought it only worked on dolls . It would affect anyone with Active architecture . But you released her . Why would she still have your architecture in her head ? No one ever really leaves here , do they ? Echo , it 's time for a treatment . Do I get to help November ? If he makes me someone else , I won 't be able to help her . That 's okay . The person Topher 's gonna make you is going to help us . Her Handler 's not gonna be too happy when he learns you sent her out without him . Mr. Ballard 's unhappy about a great many things at the moment . His complete focus needs to be on Madeline 's retrieval . Are you sure you don 't want me to cover her engagement ? I need you on point in operations . Echo will be fine . Any qualified interim Handler will do . - BOYD : I 'll send Edwards . - Fine . Just tell him not to nod off . Echo 's gonna be doing most of the handling on this one . PERRIN : Mmm-hmm . Try the Transit Limited account . The one that paid out to Madeline . See if we can run a trace on it again . Maybe it 'll link back to a Rossum subsidiary . ( SIGHS ) You know what , Burt ? It 's getting late . Let 's finish this in the morning . ( GASPING ) ( ECHO CHUCKLING ) Wake up , Mr. Senator . I want to make sure I get your good side . ( LAUGHING ) ECHO : Hi . Trust me , you 've got nothing to be embarrassed about . What the ... Who the hell are you ? You forgot me already ? I 'm hurt . I 'm Brie . I don 't know you . I 've never seen you in my life . Hate to disagree with you , Senator , but you 've seen all of me . I can show you the instant replay if you 'd like . I blacked out . You had to have drugged me . Should we order some champagne ? I think we should order some champagne . - We 'll just bill it to the taxpayers , right ? - Stop it . Shut up . I just ... - I have to think . - Fine , testy . I 'll leave then . Okay . I sent the really good stuff to my employers before you woke up . I just stuck around because I 've got a message for you first . - Rossum sent you . - I just go where I 'm told . I don 't get names . The message is , " Back off . " The message is , " Back off . " Okay . So , thanks for the fun times . I 'll get out of your hair . ( EX CLAIMS ) Nice . I like it a little rough . Just don 't touch the face . - My God . - Or I could tie you up . ( GIGGLING ) It 's amazing . So real . Mmm . Duh ! - You 're a doll . - Thanks . You 're cute , too . Rossum would never risk hiring a call girl . Not when they can program someone instead , whose memory they can erase when they 're done . Wow . They didn 't tell me you were extra crazy . - I typically charge more for that . - You 're a doll . You 're not real . Dude , maybe you should take a nap . Sleep this off . - We 're leaving . - Where are we going ? - To see my wife . - You 're twisted . I like that a lot . Threesomes are extra , but I might just give you a freebie , Senator . Langton , I have eyes I need you to take out . BOYD : It 's gonna take a second . Uploading malware now . Got it . You 're clear to move . Try to understand what I 'm saying . You are not you . This place , this Dollhouse , has altered you , brainwashed you . They 've turned you into someone else . I know it 's a lot to absorb . I don 't mean to upset you . So , is this some sort of fantasy scenario ? Because I don 't get it . - When do we get naked again ? - Listen to me . You 've been manipulated . You were probably desperate and alone and they used that against you . Forced you to be a slave so the wealthy could have a play toy . It 's despicable . I 'll prove it to you . - What is your mother 's name ? - Denise . Where were you born ? What is your birthday ? Duluth . August 6th . I have two brothers . I tried to be a dancer in New York , but I made more money as an escort . - Do you really want to know my life story ? - Programming is so detailed . Of course it is . Look , you 're very sweet , but you should know I like what I do . You 're not the first john who thinks he can save me . But I can save you . I can save all of you . If I don 't stop Rossum , no one will . You 're a real hero , aren 't you ? I just want to do what 's right . Senator , no offense , but if you want to do the right thing , bringing your hooker mistress to your wife probably isn 't a great idea . Just saying . Cindy knows the top neurologists in the country . She can help you . And I need you . - You 're evidence . - Sounds like overtime to me . ( GASPS ) Madeline , listen to me . Listen to me . These people are not who you think they are . Okay ? They 're tricking you . Do you trust me ? Good . We have to get out of here . ( SCREAMING ) - Let go of me ! - I 'm not going to hurt you . - I know exactly what you did to me ! - CIND Y : Get away from her ! - Right now . - Don 't come any closer . You need my help just as much as she does . ( HUMMING ) ( BOTH SCREAMING ) You 're not a doll . ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANING ) This is new . What the hell was that ? ( BEEPING ) It 's Echo . I don 't get it . Is she anywhere near Ballard ? Why would she be anywhere near Ballard ? Because her neural architecture is cascading , which means she just got zapped with the disrupter . According to her GPS signal , she 's at that safe house . Inform her temporary Handler he needn 't return . Bring up the security feed . TOPHER : Okay . So either they just got into a fistfight , - in which case , " Go , Echo , " or ... - Senator Perrin is the doll . We 've been chasing the wrong person . - That would make Cindy ... - Perrin 's Handler . ( EX CLAIMS ) Get Ballard on the phone . Warn him . - Harding made a senator . - And sicced him on the Dollhouse . - That makes sense how ? - I don 't know . Unless he 's trying to sabotage this house specifically . - No answer . - Guys . Echo just kidnapped the conspiracy . - Where are you taking me ? - I don 't know . Anywhere else . As long as there 's a big , fat aspirin . Go back . We have to go back . My wife is back there . No way . Nothing 's turning me around . PERRIN : Brie ! - Everything you said is true . - Slow down . There are gaps . Things that aren 't filled in . I can see other people . Other lives through them . You 're gonna get us killed . It 's like I can see the seams , how it 's all constructed . I 'm not real . I 'm not who I think I am . I am a doll . Make sure you get her on an earlier flight . I 'll meet you at the airport as soon as I talk to the police . Paul Ballard , LA Dollhouse 's latest idiot hire . DeWitt had explicit instructions to leave this alone . I think it was more of a suggestion . Who are you ? I 'm Mrs. Cynthia Perrin . You 're not a doll . Because this didn 't work on me ? What the hell is this ? - But you are Dollhouse . - CIND Y : It doesn 't matter . We have our own experts . We 'll figure it out . Pack this with my luggage , the black case . It 's gotta get through airport security . Better they don 't see it . So why does Rossum want one of their ex-Actives to testify against them ? Wait until I leave , then make sure he ends up facedown in the LA River . - Okay . - I 'm gonna go find Perrin . Meet you at the airport . Do not miss the flight . I know you 're scared , but we cannot keep running like this . Okay , you said you can help me . How are you gonna help me ? ( GASPING ) Oh , God . Stop the car ! - Where are you going ? - Nowhere . Everywhere . I need to get away from it . How can I get away from it ? I don 't think you can . ( GROANS ) I think you 're a doll , like me . No . I know who I am . I know who I am ! ( EXHALES ) Please tell me I know who I am . - I think I know who he is . - Yes ? - He 's Senator Daniel Perrin . - So he 's not a doll ? He 's Senator Daniel Perrin and he 's a doll . He 's a doll version of himself . His family 's political dynasty goes back generations . Congressmen , senators , even a great uncle who was governor of Vermont , but Perrin himself was a party boy screw-up well into his mid-30s . Before he washed out at Yale , he was voted " Most Likely to Wake Up in a Pool of His Own Sick . " He was selected for his pedigree . But his ambition , somebody else gave that to him . ( PHONE RINGING ) DeWitt . - Would you be open to a bribe ? - No . Get up . ( GRUNTING ) You 're gonna miss your flight . - They 've stopped moving . - Does that mean they 've been captured ? I don 't know , but I think the team I sent to intercept them has . What ? I had a retrieval team en route , but they stopped here , and they 're not responding . - ( PHONE RINGING ) - That 's the cover number . That 'd be Brie calling in to her escort agency . - Hello ? - What did you do to him ? - Brie ? - Yeah . Brie . I guess that 's who I am now , mostly . Brie , is the senator with you ? If he is a senator . Right now , he just looks like a basket case . You did this to him . No , but I can help him . - I think I believe you . - Of course you do . That 's why you called . Treatment ? Yes , a treatment . - It 'll make him feel better . - No . No treatment . I know what that means . I know everything about you people . - Senator Perrin . - Yes . I am Senator Perrin . Daniel Perrin . I am not a doll . No , you 're not . Strictly speaking . You were born Daniel Perrin , but the man you are today is part manufactured . Your mind has been altered . Tampered with . - What are you talking about ? - Someone is controlling you . I can help you find out who , and to what purpose . Why should I believe anything you say ? Because I am the person that programmed Brie to blackmail you . If I wanted to kill you , you 'd be dead already . Hey , you don 't want me dead . Wow . I feel like we 're really bonding . Let 's discuss bonding , shall we ? Let 's discuss your wife . Senator ? - That 's her , isn 't it ? - Daniel ! - She 's not right . We should go . Now . - CIND Y : Where have you been ? - Who is that woman ? - What ? No , Cindy ... - Daniel . - I don 't even care what this means . We were never here . I never saw her . Let 's just go . - Yeah , let 's do that . Let 's just go . - Get away from me . Cin , I don 't know what 's happening to me . It 's okay , baby . It 's okay . We 'll figure it out . Remind me why I love you so much . I 'm your white knight . And I 'm your beautiful damsel . - Ever after . - Ever after . Is that it ? - Oh , God . - Daniel ? It 's all a lie . I 'm not going with you . - Take me to the Dollhouse . - Not a chance . You won 't shoot me . You 're my Handler . That 's true . But I 'm not hers . You won 't shoot her . That 's not who you are . - Put the gun down . - Don 't come any closer , Daniel . Please . Come closer . ( GRUNTS ) PERRIN : Cindy , what the hell are you doing ? She 's not gonna remember , and neither are you . Now we 're going back to D.C. So you can forget any of this ever happened . Daniel , you wouldn 't . You couldn 't . Not your beautiful damsel . You love me . Good . That 's it . Put it down . Now we have to go . You just woke up a lot of people , and they all think you 're a bitch . - She hit me , Daniel . - You 're not my wife . Cindy , don 't . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) CIND Y : Daniel ! - I 'm on your team . - I love her . I know . But I don 't have that problem . Sorry about that . Come on . I think I know where you can get some help . You want to take me to them ? They 're all bad guys , Brie . I think her bad guys are badder than my bad guys . Hey . She 's not your wife . Come on . - Hey , Madeline . - Hi . - Right on time . - Thanks . Okay , call airport security now . No . - Madeline . - No . If I can 't face him , how can I stand up to a multi-billion dollar corporation ? We 've gotta get you out of here . Who was I ? Who was I that made you so obsessed with me ? - Now 's not the time . - It 's the only chance you get . Her name was Mellie . She was my neighbor . I was FBI , and she was helping me with my investigation . ( SCOFFS ) That was the fantasy ? I was your girl Friday who you slept with the other six days of the week ? It wasn 't a fantasy . I was FBI , and I didn 't know Mellie was a doll . - The Dollhouse tricked me , too . - So that made you want to work for them ? It was part of a deal I made with them to get you out . - I agree to work for them , they free you . - So I should be thanking you ? - I want them to fall just as hard as you do . - Then let me testify . They want you to testify against them . It 's a trick . Mellie , if you do this , it would be a mistake . I 'm not Mellie . I know that . You said you freed me . When someone 's free , they get to make mistakes . Am I free ? ( BOTH GROANING ) TOPHER : Echo 's vitals and GPS , gone . ADELLE : How is that possible ? It 's not . It shouldn 't be . Someone just did something they definitely shouldn 't be able to do . - Mr. Langton . - Echo is gone . Senator Perrin , too . Call Mr. Ballard before you return to the house . Perhaps he had more luck with Madeline . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) ( DOOR OPENING ) BOYD : Still no word from Ballard . And Madeline is no doubt halfway across the continent on her way to testify in front of the Senate subcommittee on ethical neuroscience . Why would Harding hang us out to dry like that ? If we fall , half of Rossum comes down with us . With Perrin under his power , Harding controls how far the damage goes . The Senate subcommittee will clear Rossum of any contact with us , and Perrin will be hailed as a conquering hero who has rescued all these poor souls . He 'll have the political capital to pass whatever laws and regulations Rossum 's programmed him to . - They 'll be unstoppable . - Yes , they will . So what do we do ? Stop them . BENNETT : Thank you , Grace . How soon till the senator gets here ? GRACE : They said any minute . The Venus diagnostic can wait . I 'll want a clear runway . Daniel Perrin 's our bright star . Apparently they 're bringing in the LA Active that kidnapped him , too . Yes . Well , we 'll have a look at her once the senator 's squared away . It 's confirmed she 's from LA , right ? - Why would they move against us ? - Keep your mind on your work , please . The moment you start wondering about the people upstairs , they 'll start wondering about you . - That isn 't a thing you want . - Sorry . Curiosity . It 's perfectly natural . We have urges , and we are in the business of urges , so why not indulge ? - How many sugars ? - Two and a half . But we can 't . We never can indulge . We have a sacred trust . We have the privilege of living inside the human heart , for which we give up everything . We give up everything . ( PHONE RINGING ) This is Bennett . Yes , sir . It won 't be a problem . As soon as I get Senator Perrin 's body . I assumed we 'd fill him with travel memories . A layover in Milwaukee , some turbulence , and something to explain any dehydration or disorientation . Bad shrimp or a film with a dog . If you could please just make sure that no one touches him . Do we have any information about the other Active , the woman ? Might be useful to scan her , see if we can lock down her parameters . It might give an indication . I 'll report as soon as I can . They 're coming down . Fine . Hades comes in at 6 : 00 after a long term with the closeted councilman . Just keep him in holding . And cancel Aphrodite . BENNETT : Why is Hades still on the table ? - It should have been a simple ... - It should . Should . What was this ... Condition contrary to fact should ... Contrary to fact , like a lie . Should . Should . Here we are . Is he unconscious ? I can 't work him if he 's unconscious . Prep the mask , recompile the Perrin imprint and spool up the memory buffers . - And the second Active ? - Put her in first . I 'll look at her for a bit while the senator comes to . Spool his buffers and table , then keep him in holding , and then ... You know what ? You can go . I need to focus . - I can help you with the second Active . - I have to focus , please ! Thank you . I need this , to focus on this . Thank you . - CIND Y : Bennett . Another migraine ? - All in my head . Mmm . Your problems are all external . More things to explain than Perrin 's imprint . What shall we go with ? Mugging ? Tumble down the stairs ? How about he beats his wife ? The senator doesn 't beat his wife . The senator loves his wife . Lucky wife . I brought you a souvenir . The tech that fried him . Bi-neural transmitter , solid state capacitor , nano-scale solders . I know this hand . This is Topher Brink . I always wanted to meet his tech . Don 't . Unless you want to drop every doll in the house . My , my , my . How do you work ? The hearing starts in 10 hours . If Perrin 's not there , the plan is blown and we 're demoted to being dead . The other Active 's slabbed . This one 's semi-conscious . Not a threat , but you should be able to work soon . His call and response stopped working . I 'm going to have to rebuild the CR10 relays to the amygdala . A fun time for me . We 'll see how much cognitive damage the imprint sustained . - Get away from me . Get away ! - Yes , it 's going to be a full overwrite . Please ! Don 't erase me . Please don 't ! I don 't want to forget . Please . - It 's my mind . - Not for some time now . Oh , God . Who are you ? She 's God , honey . And you 've heartily offended her . Don 't you need to make sure that LA hasn 't tracked them here ? - We left clean . - BENNETT : Will you please make sure ? Will you please make sure ? Will you please make sure ? It 's going to be all right . Better than all right . This is sick . You 're sick . Who 's to say ? We 'll start working in just a moment . Where am I ? Caroline . You always promised you 'd come back to me . Let 's play . ( DEVICE REVVING ) Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! ( SCREAMING ) English - US - SDH Ripped by stlc8tr

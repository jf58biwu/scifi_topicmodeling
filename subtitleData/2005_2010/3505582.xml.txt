 For those of you just joining us , What you 're looking at is the work of z.f.t. , A terrorist organization responsible For at least a half a dozen biological attacks Over the last several months . Everything we know thus far can be found in your packets , Including a copy of their manifesto , Which elucidates their ideology and their methods : " destruction by the advancement of technology , " Which in short boils down to the following : Attempting to provoke or prepare for a war . War ? with whom ? That 's the question , isn 't it ? What we do know is that these bizarre acts Seem to be increasing in frequency And that their targets are unpredictable , And therefore unprotectable . Taxi. taxi ! We 've recently developed evidence Which suggests z.f.t. is funded by an unlikely source And a name i 'm sure you 've all heard of . William bell , founder and chairman of massive dynamic . Wait. wait. hold the bus ! You go up park , right ? past lenox hill hospital ? Yeah , six stops away. are you feeling okay ? Fine. let 's just go , please . Those of you assembled in this room now Have a single , clear-cut goal To provide actionable evidence establishing a link Between william bell and z.f.t. Special agents olivia dunham and charlie francis Will be assigning you to teams And coordinating the investigation . All efforts and information go through them . Now let 's go to work . Stop the bus . Stop the bus , please. i have to get off . Ma 'am , will you please sit down ? Please stop the bus , i have to get off now . Okay , okay . Open the door ! Oh , my god. please , please help. somebody . Oh , my god. i can 't breathe . Oh , my god . Lady , you okay ? Find anything new and exciting in there , walter ? Huh ? Well , you 've read the manifesto About a dozen times cover to cover So just wondering . I need to show you something , peter . - What 's going on ? - I don 't know . Show and tell , apparently . What is this ? i don 't know what i 'm looking at . This typewriter 's belly 's . I remember the day he purchased it . It was raining . Do you understand what you 're saying , walter ? That william bell doesn 't just fund z.f.t. , He wrote their manifesto , And is actual reopsible for everything That 's been happening ? Absolutely not . William bell was many things . He was ambitions. he was egotistical . He was temperamental. but he wasn 't a madman . Although the ideas in his manifesto are radical , He wouldn 't do this- - this--these horrendous things . He would never do it . There are references all throughout To the chapter of ethics . But there is no such chapter . It is missing . And i believe that someone has removed it To suite their own evil purposes . - I can prove it . - How ? Get another copy of the book . One with all the pages . There is no other copy. this is the only one . I 'll get it . He wrote it here in--in this lab . The , it could still be here somewhere , the original . - And what if you 're wrong ? - I 'm not wrong . And when i find it , you will see . It will absolve him , peter . Peter , it 's olivia . So this is what i 've got so far . Bus driver called 911 , Reported an agitated woman got off his bus . Moments later , she caught fire and exploded . Police combed the area . They couldn 't find any evidence of an accelerant Or an incendiary device . If there 's something strange in your neighborhood ... Who you gotta call ? So what do you make of this , walter ? Well , from what agent francis described , It 's possible we 're dealing with a case Of spontaneous human combustion . Thought that was just a myth . Oh , myth is just an unverified fact . Maybe she was hit by a tiny meteor . It 's also possible . Until i get this body back to the lab , I won 't be able to say anything with absolute certainty . All right , i 'll get the coroner To prep the bodies for transport . Bodies ? Is there another somewhere ? - You okay ? - Yeah , i just ... Broyles . Send her in . - Phillip . - Nina . I won 't play coy , phillip . I understand the fbi has opened an investigation Into massive dynamic . As you can imagine , we spend a lot of money On counter-intelligence . And any probe into our finances Raises red flags . So ... What are you fishing for ? Industrial espionage ? treaty violations ? We have evidence that indicates William bell may be involved with several biological attacks Perpetrated this past year . - That 's ridiculous . - Perhaps . But as long as you 're here , If you have something to offer , now would be the time . I 'm not one of your street thugs That you can bully , phillip . And william bell is not a terrorist . I 'd like to hear him tell me that himself . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . He 's traveling . You 're wasting your time. william bell is not the enemy . Is there something else ? Matter is just energy waiting to happen . The average adult at rest contains enough potential energy To explode with the force of five very large hydrogen bombs . You know , theoretically , you 're actually right ? Ho ho ho ho ! my son finally agrees with me ! Uh , agent farnsworth , take a note of that . Unfortunately , we 're just not very good at releasing it . No. it needs a spark , of course--a trigger . So what do you think would 've released it in her ? Some say a particle is to blame- - The appropriately named " pyroton . " Maybe we could finally prove that it exists . Peter ! fire up the electron microscope ! Uh , about that , i might 've taken that apart . - What on earth for ? - I needed the parts . For a project i 'm working on . As i said , potential for destruction in each of us Is infinite ! I had you pegged as a creature of habit . Come again . Your desk. you moved it . Uh , we know from the driver What stop she got on . He 's worked up an artist sketch rendering . So we 'll canvass the area , See if we can id her . What about the other victim ? Did the bus driver see her get on too ? Were they not together ? I 'm sorry. you mean one . There is only one victim . I 'm confused . Agent Dunham ? Where are we on this ? Uh , the bus driver remembered What stop she , uh ... What stop she got on . He gave us an artist sketch rendering . We 're gonna show it around and see if we can id her . What the hell is going on here ? Sanford . Why is the entire 13th floor Trying to link William Bell to biological terror attacks ? We have evidence that Bell might be implicated . Yeah , i know what you have . You have testimony from a dead man Who himself was an admitted terrorist . Well , his testimony confirms what we 've long suspected . Massive Dynamic may be involved Or behind the events we 've been witnessing . William Bell and Massive Dynamic Are the defense department 's largest contractors . These waters are much too deep for a fishing expedition . Are you seriously suggesting that we just ignore ? I am telling you to drop this Considering that you have nothing more Than an unsubstantiated report from a hostile source . Clear ? Are we really going to ... No . Get more evidence . Just a few more centimeters You know , Walter , working with you , It 's amazing the sort of things you get used to . You 're not the first person to tell me that . Wow . Looks like somebody could 've flossed more . Okay . Let 's just hope that She has her dental records on file . File of course ? My filing system . Perhaps that 's where i hid the manifesto ! You mean like how you seal things In the walls of your old house Or how you squirrel things away In random deposit boxes around the country ? I would hardly call that a " filing system . " I was prone to hide things because i was afraid That someone would unlock all my secrets . I didn 't realize that the someone would be me . Where 's my geiger counter ? I left it here . You think a radiation detector 's Gonna help you find the manifesto ? No . But i find that the rhythmic ticking It emits helps me think . Oh , Walter , peter actually cannibalized that For his project too . Oh , no , look , this has got to stop . Lab rule number one , Do not borrow walter 's equipment without asking ! Walter , we found a match on the victim . Her name is Susan Pratt . Thank you . We 'll take it from here . Susan Pratt . She 's 29 years old . Single . Worked for a New York highway department . Tollbooth operator . That 's a lonely line of work . Doesn 't look like she had much of a social life either . She 's definitely a table for one . Hey , liv . You think there 's something wrong with her ? What do you mean ? You know , good-looking woman in the prime of her life . No evidence of a boyfriend . Or any friends for that matter . Just doesn 't exactly strike me as being normal . Well , i guess that depends On what your definition of normal is . Liv . Hey , Charlie , I think i found something . She has a $ 30,000 check from an Isaac Winters . I found something too . I think you should take a look at this . What the hell happened to her ? Did you get it ? No , i told you they don 't have it . Has to be Franken Berry , that 's what i ate back then . If i 'm to remember where i hid the manuscript , It 's simple sense memory , Peter . But they don 't have it . For all we know , they don 't even make it anymore . I did , however , get you this . All the artificial sugary sweetness A growing scientist needs . Hello , agent Dunham ! Let me guess , you 're a cornflakes gal . Am I correct £ ¿ Uh , yeah . Why not ? So we went to the victim 's apartment And there appears to be evidence of other fires . So the bus stop wasn 't her first incident . No . Walter . Does that mean something to you ? It changes everything . We can rule out spontaneous human combustion . For one , i mean , that 's strictly a one-off event As you can imagine . So what does it rule in ? Pyrokinesis . Stop . There 's no time for jokes , walter . Pyrokinesis ? It 's not even a real word . It was made up by Steven King . You ever see Firestarter with Drew Barrymore ? Little girl who can start fires with her mind ? Mr. King coined the term , But the phenomenon existed long before that . It 's not that complicated , really . It 's merely a form of telekinesis . The ability to move objects with the mind . Merely ? However , with pyrokinetics , They can excite objects at a molecular level . Well , well , look , think , think of , of , of Each of these grains of cereal as a molecule . Uh , as the molecules start to vibrate more quickly , They generate heat . Energy . Until that energy must be released ! It 's a fascinating demonstration , walter . But it still doesn 't explain why it is That Susan Pratt blew up . I suspect this was a newfound ability . Well , it , it , it takes training To generate a heat source Outside of the body . Without proper control , the energy is turned inward . You see ? She had no other options . So you think that she had a choice To either blow somebody else up Or blow herself up . Yes . But this poor woman had yet to master her ability . Which made her a powder keg . Emotional stress , agitation , Any high anxiety would set her off . So where does this ability come from ? Is it that she was just born different Or is it something that someone did to her ? That is the real question now , isn 't it ? I 'm not cleaning that up , by the way . Dunham . We got a hit from that check you found In susan pratt 's apartment . Uh , it was cut from a law firm . Signed by isaac winters . He has an office in charlestown . Why am i not surprised you brought one of those ? Because you know me too well . If we get caught , i don 't know you at all . Looks like somebody left in a hurry . You have four new messages . Mr. winters , this is susan . Susan pratt . You told me to call you If anything odd started happening . Well , it did , after i took the tests . Please call me back . What did he do to her ? I 'm gonna call ert , have them dust for prints . Mr. winters , it 's susan again . You told me--you told me not to talk to anybody , But i 'm scared . What 's happening to me ? Attention all citizens . Evacuate the area now . Proceed to the nearest emergency shelter . This is not a test . Liv. hey . You okay ? You sure you didn 't have any LSD ? It wasn 't a drug trip , walter . Well , visual hallucinations can be caused By a number of things . Could you look straight ahead , please ? Sleep deprivation , a concussion , brain tumor . I feel like i 'm losing my mind . Oh , i don 't think so . If you were actually going insane , You 'd likely have no idea what 's happening . Take it from me . When did these episodes start ? how did they feel ? First with susan pratt 's body . Then it was in broyles ' office . The other on the street . The same people , the same places , but bleak . The , uh , the city was on fire . Fascinating . There 's another possibility , But it 's a bit complicated . Deja vu . It wasn 't deja vu , walter . Not even close . Typical protracted deja vu. prolonged . You 're familiar with the--the pliability of space-time , yes ? One minute will explain . Most of us experience life as a-a linear progression Just like this . But this is an illusion Because every day , life presents us With an array of choices . As a result , life should look more like this . And each choice ... Leads to a new path . To go to work. to stay home . And each choice we take creates a new reality . Yes . But what does it have to do with deja vu Deja vu is--is--is simply a-a momentary glimpse To the other side . Almost everyone experiences it . We feel that we 've been somewhere before Because actually we have in another reality . It 's another path . The road not taken . Walter , why me ? Why am i seeing these visions ? I don 't know . Walter , what about william bell 's drug trials ? Cortexiphan . You said that it worked on perception . Yes . If it 's true and i was part of the trials When i was a kid , Is it possible that it 's causing these visions ? I don 't know . But what i do know is that you are a committed investigator . You 're a perceptive agent . If you are having these visions , whatever they are , There must be a reason . Trust me . Really , walter , from a man who routinely sees Little green men prancing through the lab With tam o 'shanters on ? Hey , i think i found something . It 's another victim who died the same way susan pratt did . I checked it out and the guy who runs the web site Lives in malden . I 'm a special agent with the fbi . We need to speak to emmanuel grayson . May i see your credentials , please ? Mr. grayson , you operate a web site Called " galaxy truths " where you claim to uncover Conspiracies perpetrated by foreign governments . I don 't claim. i accomplish . Unlike you two . You 're just pawns being used by the government . To spread their propaganda . Look , i can appreciate your opinion , mr. grayson . No , no. look. look . You 're right , okay ? she 's a fed , but i 'm not . I 'm just like you . I am a citizen in search of the truth . Give me the photo . We downloaded this off of your web site . It claims that this person was a victim Of spontaneous human combustion . Now you gotta tell us , where did this one happen ? Budapest. three weeks ago . The victim was an american graduate student on holiday . The hungarian police say he was attacked And set on fire.That 's not the truth . Why do you say that ? Are you familiar with william bell ? Of course . William bell killed these people . What do you mean ? William bell 's company massive dynamic Is a cover for all manner of unethical behavior . Multi-national , outside the purview of government control . He founded it to continue his Experiments with impunity . Among them , secret drug trials . This was one of his test subjects . Then why would william bell have him killed ? Well , he didn 't. at least not intentionally . You see , bell is trying to activate his subjects To see which ones were successful . Some can handle the process. others can 't . - What process ? - To create super soldiers . - Super soldiers . - Yes. like khan noonien singh . To defend us in a coming war . - What war ? - I 'm sorry . - Vulcan ? - Yes . - As in the wrath of ... - yes . Let me guess. this war , it 's against ... The romulans . Renegade romulans from the future . Here to change the timeline . The sworn enemy of the federation . The federation . That would be the united federation of planets . Hmm . Yes . And you know all this because ... I am the son of Seric . Which makes you spock . Yes . Well , mr. spock , thank you for your time . We 'll let you get back to the bridge now . Live long and prosper . Okay , yes , you were right . But see that ? I 'm a big enough girl to admit when I 'm wrong . Oh , but I think we can prepare for that possibility . It shouldn 't be a problem . Uh , Mr. Prime Minister , I 'm very sorry , Would you mind holding for just a moment ? Thanks . Hello . When ? Well , no . Don 't do that . Don 't do anything until I get there . Sir , I 'm so sorry . Something has just come up . If you 'll excuse me . Yes . You too . Get me to the helicopter fast . What if we 're overlooking something ? What if emmanuel grayson was right ? About which part ? Being from planet vulcan ? No . Forget that . But some of what he said made sense . We already know that William Bell conducted drug trials With experimental drugs . Cortexiphan for one . Do you have anything stronger for my coffee ? Yeah . Bottom drawer . In the cabinet behind you . And here I was halfway kidding . What ? What your father said about me having these visions For a reason . Maybe there 's a clue in them that I 'm meant to find . Meaning what ? We have one victim . Susan Pratt . But in my visions , there are always two bodies . - Who are they ? - I don 't know . Unidentified . But maybe if I could get back to that parallel universe As Walter describes , I can ID that second charred body . Maybe what 's happening there could help us understand What 's happening here . Happening where ? Nowhere . Your new assignment . Always a pleasure seeing you , sir . Hey . Wait a sec . Harris . Can you stop ? You want me to submit for a psych exam ? That 's right . I 'm concerned for you . - Why ? - I 've read your briefs . And I 'd say your analysis borders on the paranoid . Besides which , your behavior 's been noted As erratic and driven by emotion and not just by me . That is not what this is about . My colleagues need to trust me . They need to depend on me . Not wonder in the back of their minds Whether or not I 'm losing mine . Look , this job is intense . This has got nothing to do with my ability to do my job . This is about something else . This is about you and me . This is exactly what I 'm talking about Because right now , you are acting emotionally . Yes , you 're right , I am . You know , I 've tried to move past our history . I 've tried to reason with you in the interest Of a working relationship . But you seem to get off on this . So fine . I don 't give a damn anymore . But I am not going to let you undermine my ability to do my job . You can color this any way you like , Dunham . But I am still your superior officer And that evaluation is a direct order . We need to get their statements ... You put a shoot to kill order out on the perps . You understand me ? Don 't get close to them . - Charlie - Yeah , what 's up ? I was wondering where we were On the Susan Pratt case . We 're at nowhere . Same place we were yesterday . I 'd like to look again . You have half of Boston in quarantined lockdown And you 're worried about a pair of charred twins ? Twins ? Sorry . Didn 't see you . We already ran Susan 's bio . - We didn 't find a sister . - I know . Look . You were right . Nancy Lewis . It says here that she had a twin sister Who went missing 11 years ago . Maybe Susan ran away . Changed her identity . She must 've been running pretty hard . Where does Nancy live ? She 's local . 934 Whittier . Thanks , Charlie . Nancy Lewis , my name is Isaac Winters . Nancy Lewis . FBI . We need to ask you some questions . It 's unlocked . Nancy . Coffee 's still hot . Uh , this is Dunham . I need immediate forensic dispatch to 934 Whittier . Apartment 210 . Dunham . Take a look at this . This glass has been melted . You think she 's starting fires like her sister ? What is it ? I got an idea . I 'm not sure . I got it . Yeah , I knew . Please don 't touch that window . We haven 't pulled prints yet . You 're not gonna need to . I think the protocols and the processing of evidence Are pretty clear . Let me guess , you 're new around here . - Is everything all right ? - Yeah , everything 's fine . Just tell Mr. Protocol to let me do my job , please . Uh , it 's okay . He 's with me . Are you , uh , ever gonna tell me what it is that you are actually doing ? Help me with this first . Hold the glass up here . Gently . Be sure this will be important , I was about to take my bathe . Hey . You have any problem taking it apart ? Walter tried to take back the electron microscope . But I convinced him that you needed it . So what 's going on ? Nancy Lewis was kidnapped . And we 're gonna figure out who did it . I 've seen this woman before . Why does she look so familiar ? Maybe because you dissected her twin sister yesterday . Remember ? Blond girl about 5 ' 7 " . Really well done . Melted fillings . Astrid can you plug that in to the DVI input ? Okay . Here 's the deal . Walter , the project that I 've been working on - Was for you . - For me ? It reconstructs audio . I wanted you to be able to digitize some of those old water-damaged vinyl records you have . I know how much that mean to you . Thank you , son . You know , when he was five , He--he built me a popsicle napkin holder . Dreadful design . Utterly useless . Thank you . But this- - this is ... You 're welcome . Anyway , the basic principles at work here are very simple . You all know how a record player works , right ? Yeah . A needle goes over the grooves of the vinyl And the vibrations it picks up are amplified into sound . Exactly . So the principle is the same . Except for instead of a needle , I use the electron microscope to take a high resolution , Digital image of the grooves on the surface of the record . That image is then transferred into the computer , Which translates it back into audio that we can hear . You sound just like him . I 'm guessing that with the software modifications I gave you , We 're gonna be able to do the same thing with this . So you 're saying that you can play back the glass somehow . Yeah. walter says that these pyrotechnic abilities Only occur during times of emotional stress . I think that when our twin was kidnapped , The heat that she generated ' caused that window To liquefy slightly . Which means that any sound That was in this room at that time Would 've left microscopic impressions in the molten glass . Like the grooves on a record . Exactly right . Now if you 'll please scan the glass . Okay. you 're ready to go . All right . So it 's transferring into the sound processor now . Let 's see what we got . That could 've been one of my records . It 's okay. it 's all right . I-i already have a digital scan of the glass in here . Let 's try that again , shall we ? Just slow it down . I don 't understand. it should be working . Yes. yes . Now attenuate for ambient noise . Get out of here. stay away . What do you want ? ! Please ! Poor dear . Peter , can you play it back from when he starts to talk ? Yeah. one sec . Okay , just there. where he 's dialing . Okay , can you make that clearer ? Sure. let me just isolate the sound . Are you thinking what i 'm thinking ? My cell phone app can dial the number from the tones . This is harris . Hey , charlie. i 'm headed out for a few hours . Anybody needs me , i 'm reachable by cell . You got it . I got him , charlie. he 's headed west . I 'm right behind you . Charlie , he 's approaching a warehouse off moore and adams . Roger that. we 're turning onto adams right now . He used a remote to get in . I guess we go with the old-fashioned way . No thermal activity yet . Her body temperature 's normal.We 'll know more soon . He 's losing patience . We need her active. get it done . Liv , i heard gunshots. you okay ? Charlie , we 've got a man down . Charlie , i 've got her. back northwest corner . I 'm olivia. i am with the fbi . Help me. please . Don 't worry. you 're gonna be okay . No ! Hariss , open the door ! God damn it , harris. open the door . Open the door ! I can 't breathe . Well , look at that . Good work , agent dunham . You managed to activate her before we could . Damn it , harris , open the door . She needs help . Not if she can control it . And if not , she 'll explode and kill both of you . So one problem solves another . Ah ! i 'm burning up ! You 're gonna be okay. just cald down. just calm down . Yeah , it 's me. i need to speak to him . Hold on. i 'm gonna get you out of here . It worked. she 's hot. we have an active . But she 's a loss. she 's highly unstable . Why is this happening to me ? i don 't understand . They did something to you- - maybe to both of us A long time ago when we were just kids . And right now you 're feeling the effects from that . But you can control this , okay ? You can control this and i 'm gonna help you . I just need you to focus the heat away from us . Yes , you can . Just focus. focus on anything . Just focus , nancy . You can do this , nancy . You can . Yeah , i 'll take care of it . There won 't even be a trace . I , uh , uh ... Oh ! it 's okay. everything 's gonna be okay . Oh , yeah u 're gonna be okay . Oh , it 's okay. it 's okay . Okay. i think you got all of that , walter . I 'm gonna use the bathroom. be right back . Exscuse me , could you keep an eye on him , Make sure he doesn 't leave ? Where 's peter ? Peter 's in the bathroom . What the hell did you people do to us ? You and william bell , walter. what did you do to me ? Susan pratt and nancy lewis are From jacksonville , florida . Just like nick lane , The guy that you conducted drug trials on When he was a kid . The drug trials that you conducted on me . They were belly 's . They 're belly 's trials . But you knew . Walter , you were there and you knew . We were trying to help.It mant no harm . No harm ? You were drugging children. three-year-old children , walter . Why did you do it ? We were trying to prepare you . To make you capable. able . Something terrible is coming . - What ? - I don 't know . Walter , what did you do to us ? I don 't know . - Damm it , Walter £ ¬ you do . - No , i don 't . I don 't . I-i can 't remember . I 'm sorry . Walter . What just happened ? Nina. what is it ? These were all taken in the last 24 hours . You know what happened the last time he appeared With this kind of frequency . We need to talk . Astrid , i found it . The original manuscript with the extra pages . I was right. listen to this . " our children are our greatest resource . " we must nurture them and protect them . We must prepare them so they can one day protect us . " You see , i was ... Hello , walter . Oh. hello . It 's time to go . Is it time ? I 'll get my coat . Evening .

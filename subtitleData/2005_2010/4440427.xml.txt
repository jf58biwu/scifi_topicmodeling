 Subtitled by Yannick Lefoulon ( Alias : Kortess , Sairek , Oxytess ) . Our world was created by a miraculous force called " The AllSpark " . With the AllSpark , there was no strife , no inequity and no need for war . In my life time and that of a generation before me , we knew only peace . A peace that flourished under the reign of Optimus Prime and the Lord high protector , Megatron . At first , Prime and Megatron ruled as equals , the one fair , the other firm . Then something changed in Megatron . And what happened next none of us saw coming . He struck us from within , his goal to possess the all-powerful AllSpark for his own twisted purposes . Those of us loyal to Optimus Prime , swore to defend the AllSpark at all costs . None of our lives matter ! The AllSpark is all . With the AllSpark new life can arise . Whether here or elsewhere . Only a trusted few know this but preperations are underway to send the AllSpark into deep space . Better that than allow , Lord Megatron to possess it , to corrupt it . Remember , as long as there is hope there is life . The AllSpark ! Prime , you fool ! Even now you underestimate me ! My job is done . The AllSpark is finally beyond your reach . You ! You have cost me the AllSpark ! You ! It seems I must do this the hard way . It may take longer , the result will be the same . On the day I claim the AllSpark as my own all of Cybertron will fall and the universe itself will tremble . My arm has eventually reattached but my voice capacitor had shattered beyond repair . It is decided , we too must venture out beyond Cybertronium space to find the AllSpark before Megatron . I still wonder , did I do enough ? Perhaps like Megatron said , all I did was delay the inevitable . And perhaps helped spread our war to other worlds . It is near . It calls to me . The AllSpark ! Terra firma ... Seems anything but to me . The matter beneath my feet is both unknown and unstable . Too late . I realize , my own massive and external body temperature spell my downfall ! No ! The AllSpark ! Not when I was so close ! Over here ! What is it , Danko ? Something under the ice , captain . Whatever it is , it set the dogs off something rotten . It 's big . Must be down , what , ten , fifteen feet ? - Winky , hand me a pick . - Captain Witwicky , wait ! We had more 'n our share bad luck this vogaye . Perhaps it 's the Fates , telling us to leave well ' nuff alone . Sorry , Danko . But I didn 't come all this way to be well ' nuff alone . I tell you , I saw the face of the devil ! It 's eyes burned . And that ... was the last thing that I saw . That 's not quite true , is it Captain Witwicky ? In fact , according to those members of your crew we interviewed you retained measure of sight for some three months after the incident in the Arctic Circle , during which time you filled no less than 176 sheets of these papers with these curious designs . Care to tell us what they mean ? Mean ? I ... I ... I was possessed . That thing ... looked into my soul ! I saw the future . Their war . Our world . Yes , well ... We 'll get back to you . - Well ? - Irredeemably insane . Brought on by the extreme rigors of the voyage . At least that we 'll put out . - So , you believe him , then ? - Oh , yes . He saw something . It 's just the matter what exactly ? What about Witwicky 's personal effects ? They can go to the family , after all he 's hardly likely to be needing these . When do we leave ? Morning tide . The legislature has granted us unlimited funds . And kiss your wife and children if I were you , you may not be seeing them for some time . Call this intuition but I have a feeling that after this one nothing will ever be same again . Where is he ? Where 'd you think ? - He 's talking to it again , is he ? - Ah-ha . Downright strange , if you ask me . I didn 't . Won 't be long now . As soon as the environment dome is complete , we can begin the excavation properly . You and I , we 're going to make history . You what ? No . No , honestly I don 't think he 'll care what you 've found in Colorado . Wild horses couldn 't drag him away from his so-called " Mega-man " . Symbols , you say . I don 't ... I thought that 'd get your attention . Whatever 's down there , is not only generating more power than Chicago it 's covered with the same symbols your Captain Witwicky got all worked up about . - Quite something , isn 't it ? - Yes , I suppose it is . You were there , weren 't you ? When they dug him out of the ice ? Yes , I was there . In many ways " Project Mega-man " has been my life 's work . And now he is coming here , to the Hover Dam . Yes . Do you know what Captain Archibald Witwicky was purported to have said after they dragged him screaming from that icy crevasse . No . What ? " Mine eyes have seen the glory ! " I believe I know what he meant . Do you think they 'll come ? Others ? Not in my lifetime , maybe not even in yours but they will come . We could pour other six million tons of concrete on top of it and they still sniff it out . - If they do find it ... - Not if ... when ? Uplink enabled . Downloading images to your VTP site now . Roger , Hubble . Processing data stream . Get me the watch commander ! It 's confirmed . We have a visitor . We sectioned all of Hubble 's routine surveillance footage of Mars for the immediate period before and after the planetfall . As you can see , it 's what we 've been waiting for . - Same species ? - Looks that way . As far as we can tell it arrived under it 's own steam , within some kind of space going carapace . On touchdown , it transformed . - Then Mega-man has a relative ? - Exactly . Tactical teams are on stand by . As soon as the visitor makes his move we make ours . Now , that is what I called a sand trap . Hilarious . This is him , right ? N. B. E-2 ? Right . But where is he ? We tracked him the entire way down and had the impact area secured within ten minutes . It should be still here , inside our perimeter . What 's over there , beyond those trees ? The I-64 . Come on , come on . Damn ! Get me satellite surveillance ! Target is mobile . I repeat , target is mobile ! Show me . Here 's the specific grid vector surveillance footage you wanted . Based on your rough time frame . I 've enlarged and enchanced the image . What ? What am I supposed to be looking at ? I 'll freeze the image . There . Yellow Chevy Camaro number 1 . We figure it for a ' 75 or a ' 76 . Then exactly fifty-eight seconds later Chevy Camaro number 2 . - Well , I 'll be ... Our boy is a mimic . He must have , what , scanned first Camaro and then transformed . I want a team of six , scrutinizing every inch of traffic camera footage from I-64 to west . Try and track his progress . - Where do you think he 's headed ? - No idea . Chances are he doesn 't , either . But we have to assume he has the wherewithal to find his way there . My legacy ? I have a legacy ? That 's right son . Courtesy of my great grandfather your great great grandfather Captain Archibald Witwicky . - He was an explorer . - Fantastic ! What is it ? Gold coins ? Rubies ? - Junk ? - That junk , Sam , is all that 's left of Archibald 's last great voyage to the arctic circle . He was a true pioneer . A trailblazer , he was ... Insane ? According to this , they stuck him in a mental hospital and pretty much threw away the key . Great . I 'm descended from a madman . Hey , hey ! No one ever proved there was any actual mental illness . My father told me he was just traumatized . # I haven 't found ... # ... what I 'm looking for # I haven 't found ... # ... what I 'm looking for So , who is this guy they 're sending in ? A specialist . That 's all they told me . Seems he 's to be in overall charge of the operation . Say that 's Oppenheimer , isn 't it ? What 's the connection ? He was part of the original think-tank . Set up to analyse and apply the science behind N. B. E-1 . - N. B. E. - 1 ? - Yep . How else do you think we won space race ? So , all these ... Gentleman . Sorry to keep you waiting . I am Agent Simmons . - Right . The specialist . And this ? - This is ... bait . - Where are we headed ? - New Mexico . An old cold war bunker . It 's been adapted for our use in exactly this kind of scenario . And you figure you can just reel him in ? Absolutely . N. B. E. - 2 is here for the same reason N. B. E-1 was . He 's looking for the cube . And we are gonna let him think he 's found it . Is that simple , huh ? We just wait for him to show up and than tag and bag . Yeah . It 's that simple . Look , it 's not like we don 't know what we 're dealing with here . Primitive . Yes but evidence of intelligent life nonetheless . We 'll need to proceed with caution . Fine . As long as we get to kill something along the way . Say again , Bravo-Echo-Niner-Six . I repeat , I have an uniditified impact within Raptor designated test area . I 'm detouring to investigate . Bravo-Echo-Niner-Six , please give us your current course and position . Roger , control . I switched to bearing ... What the ... I have what I need . You can go now . Report ! Blackout here . Planetfall was clean . No witnesses . Local camouflage enabled . - Barricade ? - Yeah . Same . Well , no living witnesses . What 's our next move Starscream ? Lock onto my position and reunify . Then we find ourselves the AllSpark . - And Megatron ? - Right , yeah . Him , too . What is it ? An isotope , derived from the sub-atomic matter of the Cube . It 's artificial , of course . Last time someone tried to actually substract matter from the Cube itself well , three mile island anyone ? So this isotope , it 's giving off the same sort of energy signature as the Cube ? Almost identical . And when N. B. E. - 2 picks up the scent we 'll be ready . # There 's one more ghost here # And he sits in your chair They 're coming . None of us safe here . They 're coming here . # And he lays down his head # On your ... Two days now and nothing . Maybe only the real deal will do . Patience . Patience . We waited over a hundred years for this another day or so won 't hurt . You know something , Agent Simmons ? More time I spend with you more I think this is , well , personal somehow . You could say bagging N. B. E. ' s runs in the family . Wait , you aren 't ... Ever since that first one came out of the ice under the watchful eye of my great grandfather it 's been a waiting game . Sir , delta-seven eye reports a positive sighting . N. B. E. - 2 is within the perimeter . Alert all Tac-Teams . But tell them to hold position . No one is going to engage until I give the signal . Yes , sir . I 'll ... MM. Go ahead delta-seven . - Understood . - What is it ? Local law enforcement in pursuit . Get rid of them . Invoke whatever national security protocols you see fit but have them brake of the pursuit , now ! Yes , sir . According to this none of the New Mexico divisions has an unit in the area . - Out of state ? - No . Nothing . - It 's another one . - N. B. E. - 3 ? Or more . So much for the element of surprise ! All teams , converge on the acquisition site ! Target is now a MH-53 helicopter . I repeat , a MH-53 helicopter . Starscream , whatever downs there , it 's not the AllSpark ! This is a set-up ! Intelligent and prepared , huh ? I 'm started to like it here . Ready catch nets and prepare for cyro-immobilization . Roger that . Huh . Not on your best day . Sir , we 've lost Apaches One and Two ! - Have the other squads move in . - But sir ... Do it ! I can do this all day . But it occurs to me if these beings knew enough to simulate AllSpark 's resonant energy signature , it 's likely they know where the actual AllSpark is . You keep them busy , Starscream . - What 's happening ? - Something is in our network . It 's going through our security firewalls like they weren 't there ! Break our connection to the S-7 mainframe . Purge all on-site systems . Do it , now ! Damn ! Starscream they cut me off . - Get anything ? - Not much . A name , Sector Seven . Otherwise , it 's a dead end . - Maybe not . - Barricade ? I was tracking an Autobot in local camouflage . Only he got wise to me before I could take him out . - And ? - And ... Now I figure to maybe cut him loose , let him run . No telling how long he 's been here , on this planet and what other leads he may have . So we sit back and let him lead us to the AllSpark . Do it but make it look convincing . # I get knocked down but I get up again # You 're not gonna keep me down # The road keeps winding # I get just a little closer # The road keeps winding # I get just a little closer # The road keeps winding Subtitled by Yannick Lefoulon ( Alias : Kortess , Sairek , Oxytess ) .

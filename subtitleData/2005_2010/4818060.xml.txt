Good ! It 'll be a three-on-three . One match to decide it all . There we go ! Goal ! The win goes to The Worst ! worst ! We are The Worst ! So I believe we can expect this year 's take from Grepa District ... ? we know . It 's yours . See ya ! A toast to those who came before us . Beautifully done ! You three are very talented . Who the hell are you ? How dare you sit on my machine ? ! Don 't get hung up on these things . huh ? What 's your business here ? You three want to play a game ? Let 's see who 's the best in this town . What ? are the best ! and Dunk Mask . Looks like that piqued your interest . I 'm the captivating promoter Haruka Gracia . I promote both beauty and matches . But a gal traveling ' alone ? Is Rollingtown that great of a place ? That 's what I want ... to find out ... destroy ! One more ! One more ! Is that your whole strategy ? ! Not quite ! My real aim is this ! Come on ! Now we 're really gonna get started ! retreat ! They 'll haul you away ! What ? You 're kidding ! Things were just getting started ! so hurry up and get out of here ! Dan ! you guys ! they 'll catch you again ! This match isn 't over ! you — Shall I say it again ? Quit stalling and do as I tell you ! Dammit ! That woman ! Man you 're so noisy . How many days in a row is this ? Ten . Every morning you 've woken us up yelling " That woman ! " How about you cut that out ? Shut up ! It 's her fault for pouring cold water on things right when we were all ready to go . right ? You should be glad you didn 't get tossed in the slammer again ! Dammit . It was just about to start . As I 'm sure you are aware this is a meeting to re-evaluate our strategy . streetball played with Bigfoots is sprouting up all over the place . They 've already established local rules . except for the extent of rough play permitted ... body shots against your opponents . Moves that result in injury to another player are fine so long as there 's a play for the ball . things like running on rooftops or bouncing the ball off walls are approved . huh ? Yep . And not just Dan . Sela and Iceman are respected as the living examples of street . I ain 't requested for nothing . Idiot . Respected . But that 's merely for all the ground you 've broken in the past . they 're two or three steps ahead of you . whereas you three are not playing . we have a showdown ! That score still hasn 't been settled yet ! Why get hung up on a petty little showdown like that ? Petty ? ! It 's not a petty little showdown ! It 's — Do as I tell you ! You three will play matches ! Interesting matches that will get anyone who 's watching fired up ! you can do it whenever . If I wanted to . Whoa ! Bigfoots can turn into cars ? ! wait like a good boy . I 'll arrange an even better match for you . Hey ! Where the hell are you taking my Dangan ? It 's getting some tune-ups before the match ! of course ! What 's a toon dump ? What 's this " Dangan " thing ? That blasted Haruka took Dangan away ! what 's this " Dangan " thing ? so they are probably getting tuned up ... My Dangan doesn 't need a toon gunk ! why don 't you just do it with plain basketball ? Dumbass ! I already tried that ! wait up ! We got a showdown ! Let 's play ! dammit ! Iceman Hottie ! No thanks . Why not ? ! right ? Nope . No need to be so blunt ! It was settled for me the night you used your move on me . Probably . Huh ? What are you talking about ? The style you showed me ... and beautiful that BFB wouldn 't even compare . it ought to make an actual game . H-Hey ! You were right there doing it ; didn 't you feel anything ? Dan JD . let 's leave it in Miss Haruka 's hands . ... is what he said ! Haruka must 've gotten to all of them first ! I don 't think that necessarily means ... Oh ! A customer ! yes ! Welco — Dunk Mask . Is he here ? What did you say ? ! you aided your younger sister ? Yes . I told Flora of a way out of the Palace . How could this be ... There is no need for concern . she is quite adept at fending for herself . No bites ... The Worst ... Dunk Mask . The Worst ? You guys are the ones who Haruka picked for opponents ? That 's right . I was told to come and let you know the day of the match — Not doin ' it . Tip-off is at — Go home ! Haruka Gracia told me about you . Hard to believe this bird-brained pipsqueak is Rollingtown 's legend . What 'd you say ? ! you 'd better not ! Why ? evil gang in the Bad Zone ! They 're The Worst ! Ouch . Such horrible slander . but if you think you can stand a chance against me in a Bigfoot — Do as I tell you ! but I 'm not doin ' it . What ? huh ? Dunk Mask ! Bastard ! I 'll show you what 's what right here and now ! Take that ! And that ! { continues in bg } Is this guy really the legend ? ! just a regular moron ! Kick this moron 's ass so bad that there 'll be no way for him to fight us except in a Bigfoot ! We are The Worst ! Legend ? Face us in a Bigfoot three days from now ! Dan sure does get beat up a lot . His eyes rolled back . he — he rolled them back to the front again . Dammit ! Stop right there ! There is no way I 'll ever roll over and do as Haruka says ! That 's right ! So stop stalling and let me see the mayor ! it isn 't poisoned . Are you a runaway ? Should I have the police take custody of you ? N-No ! No royal fam — No police ! uh ... Bread ! Thank you very much ! what should we do about this ? we need to crack down on this right away . W-Wait ! You can 't ! They 're in a meeting right now ! I have a proposal . Where the hell did those bastards go ? ! Coco ! Coco ? How have you been doing ? Oh ? Your brother ? Your brother is so fine that he couldn 't be any finer ! Just now he was chasing some gang called " The Toast " or something to give them a good scolding ! So you 're getting into fights ? What happened to your Bigfoot ? Your brother won 't just roll over and do what those huge boobs say ! Bust size has nothing to do with it . Yes ! Exactly ! You 're not my little sister for nothing ! Size isn 't everything when it comes to busts ! Don 't worry ! I don 't notice your bust size at all ! you might want to hold out for a bigger future than that . How is it ? This is a real Bigfoot ! I 'm not done yet ! I bet this one could pull off even better tricks ! Go ! Brother ! I love you the most when you 're in your Bigfoot ! Coco ! Your brother 's gonna operate that Bigfoot ! that woman Haruka took my Dangan away somewhere . And the old guy and Ganz are gone too ... Nothin ' I can do . Guess I 'll eat the can you gave me and think it over again . sometimes it 's hard having you for a sister . This time I don 't have a can opener . can opener ... That 's ... stupid-head . Hey ! A can opener ! So good ! not " so good " ! My teeth are all worn to nubs .. right ? jerk ? I 'll have you know ... I was in an extremely pleasant place . I forgot the passage of time ! But my happiness didn 't last for long ... I 'll leave the work to you . we 'll handle it . What ? ! you know where my Dangan is ? ! Yeah ! Coco ! Good food ! There 's something special about a drink after a hard day 's work . finishing this job three full days ahead of the deadline Miss Haruka gave us — I 'd expect nothing less from old man Souichi . This is great ! It 's great ! These controllers ... It 's just like I 'm dribbling with my own hand ! Grandpa . you 're here ! Ganz ! What are you two doing here ? like we said ! You were enjoying it just now ! you mean ? too . Now that you mention it ... And Bigfoot-to-Bigfoot communication is possible within a radius of a hundred meters . That 's my Gramps for you ! Miyuki ! Bel ! Were you guys in on this too ? We were told a little while ago . yeah . We had to do it that way . All the upgrades needed a bunch of parts from the black market here in the Bad Zone . I doubt I could 've come to such a dangerous place with my granddaughter in tow . But I ended up coming anyway . Dan ? About what ? Seems like there are people who wanna fight your Dangan . You don 't mean — You guys have been there this whole time ? We figured the legendary Dunk Mask would come here no matter what . who are these guys ? They 're The Toast . Sounds tasty ... you can eat ' em ! so why don 't you just settle this with a match ? You think a three-on-one will be a match ? now he 's yellow-bellied . So you can fight three against one but you can 't play ? What ? ! Dunk Mask ? You guys ... Dan ? it 's a three-on-three . all the mechs here have been upgraded in the same way as yours . Guess I have to then . Dan . Miss Haruka just left to get permission from the Mayor of Rollingtown for a match three days from now . Three days from now ? Permission ? Mayor ? it started ! What ? You want us to officially acknowlege those punks ' ball-games ? Yes . their streetball will become big business . not to mention all of Earthdash . it won 't just be our town getting destroyed — That 's right ! The number of casualties will skyrocket . Good festivities always involve some danger . What was that ? What 's going on ? Bad news ! What is it ? Several Bigfoots are running wild near the Bad Zone ! What ? ! Where are the police ? ! those kids . where are you ? ! That 's the first time you 've called me by name . In front of Tepla Canal ! Okay ! Three-P ! The canal ! All right ! catch ! Iceman ! I ain 't gonna go easy on you just ' cause you 're a soft BFB player ! Wrong ! Iceman Hottie ! Destroy ! Hey ! There 's Bigfoot basketball going down at the end of Bwess Street ! Who 's playing ? and the Living Legends ... Dunk Mask ! kick-ass . Dunk Mask ? Wow ! Dunk Mask ! This rocks ! and the Toasts ' voices just fine . Worst ! And these shoes are so light and their grip is so strong ... This is ... This is ... Like I 'm playing basketball in my own skin ! What is this ? What a turnout ! We 've been waiting for this ! Now the heroes of street are gonna show us what they 've got ! All these months since the stadium was destroyed ... Weren 't there many of us who lost our love for those BFB fools ? I did ! But now look ! Just look at what 's unfolding before our eyes ! This is basketball ! This is streetball that surpasses BFB ! Keep your eyes peeled ! Run ! young lady ? Y-Yes . Please be careful . The men in this part of town are all savage beasts . Not counting myself . Dumbass ! Quit messing around ! Serves you right for trying to impress a girl ! Shit ! Are they ... giants ? Dunk Mask ! You 're really gonna go for that spot as the goal ? Damn straight I am ! There 's no point unless the goal is the spot that stands out the most ! dumbasses ! Dumb " ... " mess " ... Sela ! What do you want ? Circle around the other end of Pekkle Street ! What ? Why ? Idiot ! Don 't you mess around either ! Just go ! jeez ! you take Cross Street ! Idiot ! Don 't mess around ! bakasuka ! Note : It 's a pun . See the website for more info . bakasuka ... Ganz . What 's the meaning of that ? or a bit carried away out of youthful enthusiasm ... taking this global would have been a piece of cake ... Taking it global ? never mind . I 'll think of some other — don 't tell me those kids are going to ... They 're coming this way ! U-Unbelievable ! City Hall ? Bakasuka ! Mine ! What ? ! Destroy ! Bakasuka ! Bakasuka ! bakasuka ! Basquash ! Basquash ? Basquash ? Basquash ! Sweet ! The next goal is the moon ! Here we go ! Basquash ! Is that the legendary tracery ? It seems we won 't have to wait much longer . wasn 't it ? All of Earthdash was watching over the Net . And maybe even the peeps on the moon ! What ? The moon is coming ? ! This 'll be a perigean approach !

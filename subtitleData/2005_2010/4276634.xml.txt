 You keep an eye on Wes ? - He 's very depressed , David . - Yeah , I know , Mayko told me . - My eyes are bleeding . - It 's a side effect of the interferon . - And my HIV 's gonna turn to AIDS , Bob . - I can 't leave you . I 'm ... It 's mainly his left side . Fractured distal tibia , broken femur . I 'm gonna die , Rachel . I 'm experiencing strange memories . Roth 's lab . Except it 's deserted . You know the woman I was thinking about ? - I can draw her . - She 's pretty . Get me the Amsterdam treatment . - It 's too experimental . - Do it . Give me the treatment . What else can I do ? Help ! He 's not breathing ! Take it easy . It 's okay . I need someone , now ! I 'm willing to take full responsibility . I think you can give a little credit to Wes . From what you 've told me , it sounds like he put you in a very tough position . It doesn 't excuse what I did . He 's in anaphylactic shock . Stay with me , Wes . What the hell happened in here ? I could have killed him . Any idea ... why he had an allergic reaction ? I don 't know . I mean , it could have been the linkers that attach the Hep C receptors to the red blood cells . But ... that would take months to figure out , and ... he doesn 't have months . We 'll make him as comfortable as we can . That sounds so terminal . I 'm sorry , Rachel . I can 't give up . I 'm not saying that you should . But if you try any more experiments in this hospital , you could be facing criminal charges . I understand . And I 'm willing to face the consequences . ReGenesis 4x05 Suspicious Minds Subtitles Team NorBAC Bbsiocnarf , Dapitch666 , Enelea , Golgi Icefre @ k , Linwelin , Michvanilly , miki Version NoTag 1.0 'Morning . You seen Rachel anywhere ? She does still work here , doesn 't she ? Mayko , you 're fired . She went to the hospital last night to be with Wes . - How 's he doing ? - I haven 't heard from her this morning . Look , did you read this ? The girl poisoned in Ottawa ? She 's the daughter of City Councilor Randall Oberman . He 's trying to stop the construction of a mosque . Any reason ? Some kind of zoning issue . But of course he 's got the Muslim community all over him . So he thinks they poisoned his daughter ? That 's what Oberman 's saying . He got a bunch of death threats since he spoke out against the mosque . And the Muslims are calling it discrimination . They 've been under a lot of harassment since 9-11 . People want them out of the neighborhood . How 's the girl doing ? She 's still in hospital . They can 't ID the poison . So they don 't even know if she was poisoned ? I guess . Sounds like political bullshit to get people on Oberman 's side , Mayko . - Maybe we should look into it . - I knew you were going there ! They had to close down the high school after they had a near riot ... 'cause a bunch of kids attacked some Muslim kids . And then some Muslims went and defaced a local church . Can 't we all just get along ? What ? Hello , David . I hope it 's about Olivier Roth wanting to have lunch with me . What do you know about Lincoln , Nebraska ? They got a great tractor museum . Yes , about the woman with smallpox . She doesn 't have smallpox . She 's got vaccinia . - David ... - It is a weaker cousin of smallpox - used in a vaccine . - I know . CDC says she got it from her husband . He was a Marine on his way to Iraq . He was vaccinated against smallpox . He kissed his wife goodbye and managed to pass on the closest thing to smallpox a human being can get . She 's dying . Sorry to hear that . The FDA is willing to fast-track some drugs for compassionate use . What drugs ? Homeland Security commissioned three biotechnology companies to come up with a cure in case of a smallpox attack . Oh yeah ? How 'd they do ? Don 't know . Never tested it on an actual smallpox victim . That 's because smallpox was eradicated in 1977 , Carl . Yeah . Well , now we have a unique opportunity . Carl , referring to a dying woman as a " unique opportunity " is sick . Whatever . Homeland wants NorBAC 's opinion on which drug to use . Fine . I 'll need to see all the studies done by the companies , - both successes and failures . - It 's on its way . - How many days do we have ? - 24 hours . - Why the rush ? - It 's all the time she 's got left . No . Nicely done . I don 't think you should put this on your resume . Wes , Wes ... I 'm so sorry . - It 's okay . - So , how are you feeling ? - The broken ribs aren 't bad . - Right . My leg is a little itchy , my kidneys and liver ache , but ... other than that , I 'm really ... top notch . You do have that sexy yellow glow . Thank you . I was beginning to think I was on the losing end of death 's stick , Miss Woods . So , how soon can we try that again ? - What , are you serious ? - Oh yes . I know you 'll figure out what I reacted to and you 'll fix it . And then we can go again , right ? Right now , maybe you should recover from my first attempt to kill you . I 'm ready to go anytime you are . You 're a mess . You know that , don 't you ? I know you 're not gonna give up on me . And I know you 're gonna figure something out . Okay , thank you . So , hey , according to the CDC , all three drugs were used in a study with cynomolgus monkeys with high intravenous doses of pox , equivalent - to late-stage disease in humans . - And ? All animals that received the drug were protected from the disease . In monkeys ? In monkeys . It 's a start . We got a long way to go to the finish line , so let 's dig in . What ? Hey , you in Lincoln ? Yeah , I just got to the hospital . Has the data arrived yet ? Yeah , we 're just starting to go over it . You better look at it fast , David . I think they may have called us too late . - Captain Richard Hilliard . - Dr. Carlos Serrano . Marianne Wiley was admitted with a blistering rash and a mild fever three days ago . Once they figured out what was going on , they started her on vaccinia immunoglobulin therapy . Clearly not working . - Have you tried antivirals ? - I 've tried everything . - May I ? - Sure . I 'm Dr. Carlos Serrano , with a lab that 's here to research the different treatments . Yes , have you decided ? We 're not quite there yet . - Well , she can 't wait that long . - Mark ... Let him do his job . Sorry , sir . I 'm Mark Wiley , Marianne 's husband . Hi . Marianne , how are you ? We 're going to need to do a quick examination . It hurts her to be touched , okay ? She says it feels like her skin is tearing off . That 's all right , we don 't need to touch her . What about her pain ? We can increase the morphine . But we 'll have to put you on a ventilator . - Baby , it 's okay ? - It will give your body a rest . I 'm afraid ... Don 't be afraid . I 'm like an alarm clock , okay ? Take the morphine . Give your body a rest . Doc , may I have a word ? Sure . Increase morphine to comfort and prepare for intubation . Just hang in there . I 'll be right back . So how come I 'm not sick ? Your body 's healthy and you can cope with a live vaccine . I don 't understand . Marianne was healthy too . Well , Marianne has eczema , which can be a sign of an immune deficiency . But how did she get it from me ? Pox viruses are usually transmitted through close oral contact , a cough , maybe a sneeze , - maybe a kiss . - A kiss ... did this ? Thank you , sir . - Hey ! - Hey . Sorry I 'm late . So , what 's up ? How 's Wes ? He 's ... I almost killed him , David . Come here . Come here . Sit down . What happened ? A systemic allergic reaction . He 's all right now ? Yeah , he 's ... I spent the last I don 't know how many hours going over this , and I can 't ... I can 't figure it out . I don 't know what else to do . It 's okay . - I don 't think he 'll make it . - Ah , come on ! Fuck that shit ! I know , but David , I have tried everything , and I don 't know what else to do . What do you know about BT-590 ? Protease inhibitors ? Just that toxicity is an issue with that . We 'll think of something We are going to think of something . - I have to stay on this . - Absolutely . You do what you have to do . - Thank you . - Okay . Is it smallpox , Captain ? Should we be concerned ? No , it 's not smallpox . But it has many of the same symptoms and it can kill people . That 's not true . Is it contagious , Captain ? Should the military stop the inoculation program ? No , it 's not contagious . Excuse me , we 're late for a meeting . Are the inoculations safe for our troops ? Yes . What you told that reporter is actually not true . Marianne caught it from her husband , so technically , it is contagious . We don 't need to start a panic . - It could happen again . - This was a perfect storm , with several highly unusual conditions coming together . - But the chances of reoccurrence ... - Are greater than zero . Dr. Serrano , the safety of our men and women in uniform is not compromised by these vaccinations . Any time you 're dealing with a live virus , there is the possibility of side effects . And that is something the press would have a field day with . I suggest we keep it to ourselves . You 're referring to the truth ? How much longer do we have to wait ? I 'll make the call now . What ? - David , I need an answer now . - What happened to 24 hours ? Her abdomen is starting to fill with fluid and her kidneys are close to failing . - It 's not looking good . - Okay , um ... - Give me 24 minutes . - Okay . Bob ! Mayko ! - The CR-356 has some heart issues . - What kind ? - QT prolongation . - I called their chief scientist . He couldn 't convince himself it was safe . I had a comparison done of their studies and the long QT issues make CR-356 questionable . Okay , that sounds pretty conclusive . CR-356 , heart issues . Let 's sideline it , that leaves us with ST-146 from QuestLogic and LB-320 from VacMed . Each of the remaining two drugs have the same pharmacophore . LB-320 is a pro drug , though , right ? Yes . It 's inactive till your body changes it to an active form . Meaning it may last longer . It 'll be active in your body for a longer period of time . That 's good . But it showed elevated liver enzymes ... in rodents . - High toxicity ? - Correct . QuestLogic 's 146 does have a wider dose range . That nails it . It 's safer and we can give more of the drug to her without worrying about side effects . But QuestLogic has done some iffy pre-clinical studies . Remember that big FDA thing ? I do , but they cleaned house since then . They got a new chief scientist . And more importantly , their drug is least likely to harm the patient . That 's our priority . Where are the drugs ? - They 're already at the hospital . - Dr. Corwin , how is he ? Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! - Where are the drugs ? - Already in the hospital at Lincoln . Carlos , QuestLogic ST-146 . Best guess . Hang on . I got another call . Go for it . What ? Seriously , who is this ? Fuck off ! Who is this ? Well yeah , it does kind of sound like you , Sir . Yeah , sure . Okay . Right . I understand . Just ... That was the ... Prime Minister . He wants us to look into the poisoning . There have been more reprisals . I told you ! Has anybody been hurt ? He says it 's just a matter of time . The local imam as agreed to let us act as a neutral investigating ... What ? - It 's working . - What ? The treatment that almost killed Wes , it 's working . His Hep C viral load is down . It 's working . - Hey . - Hey . I knew you could do it . How are you feeling ? I don 't think I could run a marathon or anything , but ... Yeah , you 're doing fine . So are you . Marianne ... This drug has never been used on a human being before . It 's been successful in animal trials . I think it 's your best hope , but I 'm going to need your permission . It 's okay , sweetie . You need to get better now . If you could just sign here . Well , that 's okay . You can sign it . Yes , sir . I 've been talking with ... the head of the burn unit here , Dr. Fleming . She 's done incredible things with artificial skin technology . She uses collagen , and she 's able to grow epidermal cells directly on it . She tells me you 're a good candidate . My skin ... Can be repaired . I had her tested and retested . Still no trace of any poison that we can find . - And yet the symptoms ... - Consistent with poisoning . It 's okay , he 's with me . Mr. Oberman . More doctors to shrug their shoulders ? No , sir . I 'm David Sandström . North American Biotechnology Advisory Commission . The Prime Minister has asked us to help out . Good . Thank you . I 'm Stella 's father , Randall Oberman . Can you ... tell me what happened ? Stella came home around 10 pm , the day before yesterday . She was acting disoriented . I thought she was ... on drugs or had been drinking . She is 14 . Later , she threw up . She wanted to go to bed . I checked on her around 12 midnight and she was sweating like she 'd just run a marathon . She couldn 't catch her breath . I called an ambulance . When she was admitted , her temperature was 41 . She had tremors , and then some kind of a seizure . A couple of hours later , she was comatose . Has anything like this ever happened to her before ? No . No . We can 't bring her temperature down . We 've got her on maximum blood pressure medication and full ventilator support . We ran the full gamut of tests . Checked electrolytes , glucose . All normal . - No source of infection ? - No . Cultures are negative . Antibiotics aren 't doing anything . Look , we have an expert here now , Doctor . Let him take over . Actually , Mr. Oberman , I 'm a scientist . Dr. Modi is a physician . I need to hear what he has to say . We did a full toxicology screen . I sent blood and urine samples to two poison centers in Quebec and Toronto . - So , you 're treating the symptoms ? - As best as we can . Excuse me . Hopefully we won 't have to deal with his incompetence much longer . It looks like he 's doing everything right . Maybe for wherever he came from . Mr. Oberman , where was your daughter before she came home ? There was a dance at school . Stella said she was going , but no one saw her there . They must 've grabbed her . They ? Some boys , Arabs . Muslims kids had been taunting her at school and defaced her locker . - You told this to the police ? - Of course ! They ... They questioned the boys . They stuck together ... they said they hadn 't seen Stella that night . They had their ... lies all ready to go . Or the truth . Listen , Mr. Oberman , I 'm just here to find out what 's making your daughter sick , all right ? Not to start a holy war . If she dies ... Yeah . The therapy I want to get , though , hyperbaric oxygen therapy , is a well-established medical treatment . Can it do anything for a guy with half a liver ? It 's okay , Bob . I 'm doing fine . Hyperbaric treatment is more for embolisms , carbon monoxide poisoning , gangrene ... What I wouldn 't do for a good old-fashioned gangrene right about now ! Yeah ... Why the sudden interest in this thing ? Oh , well , there is some evidence that it can also help with intracranial abscess , an increase of pus in the brain . - That 's what you 've got ? - I think so . Antibiotics aren 't working ? Tell me how it works . I 'll go inside it . Then the atmospheric pressure will be increased to the prescribed amount for the treatment . And then I 'll be given 100 % oxygen to breathe for a set amount of time . That 'll clear up your brain ? In combination with the antibiotics , it has proven to be effective . That 's out-there . At one time , inserting an electronic device into the chest cavity to stimulate the heart was considered ... kind-of-out-there . Today , there are millions of pacemakers in use . - Better go . - Thanks for coming by . Bob ... I 'm sorry about what happened up on the roof . So am I. I know what you were going through and I should have ... { \ - No . } Don 't . Thanks though . Hey , thanks for the books you brought me . - Used is okay ? - Yeah , it 's great . I haven 't read this one before and my sleep is important . Get better Wes , okay ? I miss you . - Hey , Carlos ! When did you get back ? - Last night . - We made the right call . She 's stable . - Fantastic ! Bob , how 's Wes doing ? He 's eating , sitting up . He 's doing fine , David . - What 's going on around here ? - What do you mean ? Nothing but good news . What have we got on those poison , Bob ? Alcohols , amphetamines barbiturates , MDMA , paracetamol , salicylate , all negative . Ditto : opiates , tricyclics ... - Okay . - Beta-blockers , anti ... Okay , Bob ! Anything positive ? Everything was negative . 'Morning . Got that list of all the obscure poisons ? I found hundreds . { \ - Jesus ! } Some are really weird . Ever heard of Zuclopenthixol ? Alright , we screen for all of them . Mayko , set up a database . Bob , Carlos , you look for any combinations of poisons , natural , man-made , medicinal , fungal ... Anything out of the ordinary , red flag it . - What 's up ? - I did an Ellman assay , - a test for cholinesterase . - Neurotransmission suppressant ? Looks like she has reduced activity . Don 't know if it 's significant . - Source ? - Maybe a pesticide . - Do we know what kind ? - Not really . Up here . - Have you checked everything ? - Yes . I 'll redo it if you like . - Maybe you 'd better . - I 'll use a fresh kit . - We need to be really sure about this . - Yeah , I understand . Wait a minute . How much pesticide would it take to do this ? Don 't know . The test isn 't that quantitative . Find a test that 'll give us concentration levels . On it . Our girl may have been poisoned with a cholinesterase inhibitor . What 's that ? Something that sends your heart and lungs into overdrive . You can 't stop . - It is treatable , alright ? - Yeah , with pralidoximine . Work with Bob . If you can confirm that it 's a pesticide , call me immediately . Okay . Mayko , I need everything you can get me on cholinesterase inhibitors , everything they 're used in , where they 're manufactured , imports and then , get in touch with the Defense Department to see if they 've had been stolen . If it 's a pesticide , why would Defense ? Because one of its uses is in nerve gas . Oh man ! Where are you going ? Back to Ottawa . I don 't want to deliver this news on the phone . Dr. Corwin said my liver was severely damaged by the virus . Damaged , but not irreparable . It 's a transplant and it could take years to find a liver . Wes , I think that 's only one option . You don 't think it 's a good idea ? Progression of the HCV infection is sometimes accelerated with transplantation . And ... What ? you may face bone marrow toxicity and the risk of allograft rejection ... What are our alternatives , then ? I 'm looking into it . But the good news is , you 're stable , and that gives us some time to explore those options , right ? - Sure . - It 's ... You 're going to be okay . I know , Doctor . I 'm already better than okay . Come in , Dr. Sandström . - This is Detective Ian McGilvray . - Hey ! David Sandström . Look , I wanted to bring this to you personally , okay ? We think we have a lead on a possible , a possible poison , something called a cholinesterase inhibitor . Nothing conclusive , but we 're chasing it . Dr. Modi is on his way with some medication . - What kind of poison is that ? - It 's something you find in pesticides . Is there anything she could have gotten into ? Accidentally ? No . We 're talking about an over-the-counter poison ? We don 't have any conclusive evidence yet . - Sounds to me like you do . - No . We 're still running tests . In the meantime , it 's more important to treat Stella , just in case . It 's just as important to put the person behind bars who did this ! That 's his job . In the meantime , given the mood of the neighborhood , Prime Minister has asked that we do not go public until we are 100 % certain , and until somebody is under arrest , if somebody is behind this . You still think this is an accident ? Mr. Oberman , I don 't know ! If you get the name of that poison , I want it . { \ - Sure } And what you told us , that 's between us . No one leaks it to the press . We agreed to keep this under the radar until we find what we 're dealing with . I redid the Ellman assay . It still looks like a cholinesterase inhibitor . - But a small amount . - You IDed it ? Not yet . Still testing . How 's the girl ? - You talking to David ? - Yeah . Oh , and here 's Mayko . - Hey . - Hey . So , I called the Department of Defense . Nothing was stolen . Now , I did come across something else . The Nazis were busy making cholinesterase inhibitors for nerve gas . They never used it . The US have something called the 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate aka BZ . - Tons of it is stockpiled . - It 's Vietnam era . It 's old news . The Iraqis invented a similar product , and after the US invasion , their stockpiles went missing . Tons literally just vanished . - Ah , shit ! - David , what are you thinking ? That an Iraqi weapon of mass destruction ended up here , in Canada , and fell into the hands of a Muslim extremist ? And was used on a 14-year-old girl . Okay . I know I was stretching it . Listen , you keep on it , all right ? Anything else comes up , let me know . I 'll be back tonight . Can I help you with something ? You 're here about Stella ? Yes . I 'm David . - From a lab in Toronto . - Hi . You know Stella ? She poisoned ? We 're leaning that way . You want to talk about it ? - Is she going to be okay ? - We don 't know yet . What 's your name ? Nasib . We go to school together . Things had been a bit rough for her for the last two weeks , since her dad ... - Her dad is a fucking pig . - Yeah . What are you doing here ? I ... - I gotta go . - Okay . Listen ... If there 's anything , okay , anything at all that you want to tell me that could help Stella , you call me , all right ? Hey , you 're all set to go , aren 't you ? I cannot wait to have a nice relaxing night in my own bed . I bet . You care to join me ? I think that could probably be arranged . Although ... we may have to spend a little time getting you packed . Why , am I going somewhere ? How does six months in Sweden sound ? What 's in Sweden ? Wes , they 're doing some new trials . In Sweden ? Yeah , and it 's some pretty heady stuff . They 're using RNAi to stop the Hep C virus . How ? To stop the Hep C from replicating , they put in RNA inhibitors that stick to the Hep C RNA like Velcro , and it helps your body wipe out the disease . Can I get in the trials ? You 're in . - Really ? - Yes . Six months though ? Only if you want . Thank you , Rachel . Really ? I 'm gonna miss you . I 'm gonna miss you too . I love you . No matter what , okay ? I love you too . From QuestLogic . Now that we 've helped provide evidence that their smallpox cure works , government 's gonna buy millions of units and the stock will go through the roof . And all we get is this lousy gift basket , eh ? Maybe not so lousy . - I thought you were only drinking beer . - I am . I am saving this for Wes , on his return . - I 'll get sure he actually gets some . - Fine . Come in . Good timing . Good news ? Cholinesterase inhibitor in the girl is negligible . Not enough to make her sick . I don 't know if it 's good news or not . Why did the poison tests show results then ? The tests are very sensitive now . The same levels could be in any of us . Then what the hell is making her sick ? Is there another poison or are we completely misdiagnosing this ? - Any other tests we can do ? - Let 's go right back to symptomology . We 've got sweating , heart palpitations , we 've got ... anxiety , confusion and then coma , right ? All right . Cholinesterase inhibitors cause dryness . - You just said she was sweating . - Her dad did , yeah . 'Cause adrenaline or thyroid can make the heart race and cause sweating . Adrenal glands were ruled out . Then it 's gotta be the thyroid . Never got her thyroid test back . - Why not ? - Well , it takes 3 days to get results . Shit ! Well , that 's gotta be it ! So , look , we treat her for thyroid overactivity . What ? Mr. Oberman . No , no . Don 't make an announcement yet . We haven 't ... Say again ? - For fuck 's sakes ! - What 's wrong ? ... where he will be formally charged . That kid is innocent . They 're throwing gasoline on a fire . ... apparently attends the same high school as Stella Oberman . Hi , I need to speak to Detective McGilvray , please . David Sandström calling . Oh , he 'll know what this is about . You were supposed to call me before you made an announcement . There wasn 't any poison . I said that no ... Look , what I said was " possible poisoning . " Because a thyroid storm ... Thank you . A thyroid storm is consistent with cholinesterase inhibitor poisoning . Again , look , here it is : her thyroid levels are through the roof , and her TSH is suppressed , okay ? That confirms a thyroid storm . You can 't arrest a kid ... You can 't arrest a kid for poisoning someone when there wasn 't any fucking poison in the first place ! Let the kid go ! What part of that don 't you understand ? No crime has been committed here ! Good choice . Thank you . What ? It 's Narendra Modi . I 've been trying to call you since you left . Ah yeah , Doctor . Sorry , my cell phone died . They gave me your home phone . I hope it 's all right that I ... Yeah , that 's fine . What 's up ? The ultrasound confirmed a thyroid nodule . The storm may have even been triggered by the cholinesterase inhibitor . We stabilized her medically and rushed her into surgery earlier this evening . - Her own body was poisoning her . - Yeah . Which means this whole ... witch hunt was just a fabrication of one man 's prejudice . What ? Yeah . When ? Okay , thank you . Shit ... What is it ? Marianne Wiley died last night . Dios mio ! What was the official cause of death ? Heart arrhythmia . Ah , that 's terrible ! QuestLogic was the right choice . Their drug was the least powerful . It should have done nothing ... She was very sick . It 's very possible that the drug had nothing to do with it . I know , it 's just been a shitty week . Nice to get some good news once in a while . Yeah . Anyway , I just thought you should know . Thank you . Thanks , Al . And ... good luck on that thing , eh ! Wes ! I hear you 're off to Sweden . Great . Everywhere you look , you can think of me . Here you go . You 're not quitting . You 're on a six-month leave . I thought you might want to have this . It 's a little going away present . It was Caroline 's . It 's got the name and numbers of anybody who is anybody in Washington , London , Paris , Brussels . And I 've ... I 've marked my leads on Roth . Wait . Wait . Wait . You know my liver 's shot , David . Yeah , I know . This is for you . Here you go . Cheers ! - I thought you stopped drinking , David . - You 're not quitting , Wes . - Yes , I am . - You 'll be back . I don 't think so . Why ? First of all , you 're the biggest asshole I 've ever met . - Yeah , yeah , yeah . Besides that . - You 're rude . You criticize everything that I do . You 're pompous and arrogant . You say all that like it 's a bad thing . Listen to me . And listen carefully 'cause I 'm only gonna say this once . After the bombing ... I thought NorBAC was finished . I really did . You put it back together , Wes . You put us back together . This is where you belong . In that office behind that desk . We need you . I need you . Who am I gonna find who can clean up my shit better than you ? Just so you know ... I really don 't want to leave , but I have to . Okay , I 'm gonna do you a favor . - I don 't want any favors . - Two favors . First of all , I 'm not gonna let you run out that door so you bury your head in the sand , which is what I think you 're gonna do . - It 's not what I 'm doing . - Two ... you owe me a sucker punch . - I owe you more than one . - Fine . So , I will let you hit me in the face as hard as you want , if you stay . Okay . Okay . Shit ... I hope you enjoy this as much as I will . - Guess I should close my eyes , eh ? - It might be better that way . Show me who 's the better man , Wes . I know this is gonna hurt , David . I 'm sorry . No worries . Gimme your best shot . Try not to kill me though . Over two dozen people with lung infections is not an isolated incident , that is what we call an outbreak . 27 competitors for the Tour Cyclo-Quebec have been admitted to hospital . Milo , what are you doing here ? I was wondering if there was still time for that physical . Get in there . I 'm Bob . What do you think about hyperbaric chambers ? The high oxygen levels may improve my memory . Or make it worse . - Who said it was okay to race ? - This time , the race will not stop . NorBAC has jurisdiction here . Not in Quebec . Nor does Ottawa . My God ! Milo ! No , no . Wait , wait . Hold on , hold on ! You want to help him ? You help me .

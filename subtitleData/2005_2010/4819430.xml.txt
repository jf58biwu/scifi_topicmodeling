 Uh-uh , trouble at home . Yeah , I just got dumped in the form of a spectacularly written ' Dear John ' e-mail . Ahhh ... that 's life at sea . Well , sprinkle her in the chili if you want . Hey , Frye , Grady fix that railing yet ? He 's working on it , Sir . Oh ... hey , that was some nice Ping-Pong action earlier . Yeah , you 're next . How 's the port turbine ? Up and running , Sir . And ... uh ... your bruised ego ? Uh ... repairs are underway . Hmph , you 'll get over her . And how many , exes do you have , Captain ? Oh ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho , too many to count . So I 'm learning from the master . Yeah , as your captain I try to lead by example . You hear that ? Yeah . Engineering , what is it ? What 's going on ! ? We don 't know , sir ... You 're going to hear a number of alarming things today . Just try to remember this is only an exercise . As a contingency analyst , my job is to scare you , and hopefully , prepare you for the worst imaginable catastrophes . We have to acknowledge the very real possibility of a global pandemic involving a highly-pathogenic SARS-like virus ... The World Health Organization projects that ... Ah ... for the purpose of this study , we selected St. Louis . Stage One : The long-term post-nuclear radiation effect . Stage Three : Preventing widespread panic . All right , any questions ? Hey , Monster . Hey , handsome . Come on , Monster , pick a spot . Molly Anne Caffrey ? Name 's Cavennaugh . Federal Agent . One of your plans has been activated . You 're needed in Washington . You 've just become the most important person on the planet . Dr. Caffrey ? My name 's J.T. Baylock . I 'm ... Deputy National Security Advisor . Yes , I know . I take it you and Toto have been briefed ? On the ride over . You wrote this three years ago . Do you need a few minutes to refresh yourself before we throw you to the wolves ? No . I 'm good to go . Okay . No dogs allowed . Jim , watch the mutt . From what I 've heard , the Oval Office seems to think you 're some kind of genius . Oh , I don 't know about that . But I have advised them on a few occasions . Your modesty 's refreshing . Now drop it . We need you to take control . I 'll do my best . How many people were brought in on this ? How many know ? Defense , Homeland Security , Langley , NASA . We kept it limited per your protocols . What about the President ? Not yet . Good luck . Dr. Caffrey , National Security Advisor Andrea Hatten . It 's so nice to see you again , Molly . Likewise . Ladies and gentlemen , under Executive Order 221-C , I 'm reminding everyone that what we 're about to discuss has been classified Top Secret , no foreign dissemination . This image was captured by our Cheyenne Mountain facility . You 're looking at the heat bloom of an unidentified object entering Earth 's orbit ... from deep space ... at 2200 hours . At approximately 2212 , the object made a number of course corrections . Course corrections ? That 's right , Admiral . We believe it 's under extraterrestrial control . We lost contact with the object at these coordinates . The Coast Guard has informed us that a Naval vessel in the vicinity has gone silent . At this point , I 'd like to turn the briefing over to Dr. Caffrey a senior analyst at the Blackwood Think Tank . Dr. Caffrey wrote the protocols we 'll be implementing tonight . Dr. Caffrey . Thank you . Some of you may not know what a contingency analyst does . I deal in worst case scenarios the unthinkable . And this definitely qualifies . Now , Threshold was designed as a rapid response measure to a First Contact scenario . Stage One of the plan calls for an immediate quarantine of the landing site , or possibly crash site . After the object is effectively secured by a Special Ops Force , the next step calls for the insertion of a Red Team . Now , their priorities are threefold : Confirm the presence of extraterrestrial life - intelligent or otherwise - attempt to communicate with it , and , finally , to determine its intent , whether it poses any possible threat . And if it does ? You 'll find that on page 45 under the chapter heading 'What to do if we 're screwed . ' So which of the Red Team candidates were you able to get ? We got your microbiologist , Nigel Fenway . Perfect , he 's an MD with a background in pathology . Former ' 60s radical , stubborn as hell . If we are dealing with alien life , he 'll help us figure out how it eats , sleeps and breathes . Well , next up : Lucas Pegg . Jet Propulsion Laboratories , Pasadena . Great . He helped design the jupiter probe ... If we are dealing with a UFO , ... he 'll pop the hood , tell us how it works . Also one of the all-time high jeopardy winners . Good to know . Number three on the hit parade : Arthur Ramsey . Expert in linguistics and applied mathematics ... If our E.T. needs to phone home , he 'll translat the call ... The guy is brilliant . Well , he 's also got quite a ... gambling-boozer - stripper problem . We all have our vices . Really ? And what are yours , Dr. Caffrey ? I only reveal those on a need - to-know basis , Mr. Cavennaugh . Well , here 's your Red Team . Not exactly Charlie 's Angels , are they ? Let me get this straight . We could be witness to the greatest moment in human history , and you people want to keep it a secret ? Damn right . What if some kind of technology could be reverse-engineered from what we encounter ? Do we want it falling into the hands of other countries ? God forbid the government would give the rest of the world the benefit of the doubt . Here 's a thought . What if they 're hostile ? I mean , even if they 're benign , their presence alone could incite worldwide panic . Look , gentlemen , we don 't know what we 're dealing with . And until we do , whatever we discover , stays in this room . Shh . Finder 's keepers . Hey , while we 're on the subject of aliens , I don 't appreciate being abducted . How long is this little field trip gonna last ? Indefinitely . So what , I 'm a prisoner ? That 's not gonna fly . Hey , can I talk to you in private for a minute ? Door Number One or Door Number Two ? Uuh ... eh ... a-huh ... I don ... What are you what are you talking about ? Door Number One : You bring along a slide rule and a smile , and you do what you 're asked . Door Number Two : You disappear into an 8x10 cell for the rest of your life playing solitaire , courtesy of the federal government . You can 't do that - that 's illegal . So is subverting national security , my friend . We 're in dark waters here , okay ? So I 'm going to ask you again ... Door Number One or Two ? We 'll be choppering you out to the freighter with a Navy SEAL escort . Securing the vessel will be your first priority . However , we 've had a slight complication . The NSA has informed us that the North Koreans also detected the object . They 've dispatched a Kilo-class submarine to investigate . How much time will we have out there ? Five , six hours at best . What is this ? War of the Worlds ? You ladies good to go ? Probably not , but I 'd rather be safe than sorry . Have we considered how this might look ? What if they 've come bearing gifts ? Believe me , Lucas , I hope they have . Ten minutes ago , you were worried about global panic . I like to worry about things from all angles . What 's that ? Uh , it 's ... New Testament , First Corinthians . How are they going to work aliens into their Sunday sermon ? You making fun of me ? I 'm just saying ... I don 't remember reading , ... 'And on the eighth day , the Lord created Klingons . ' That 's funny . You know , that 's very funny . What 's your problem ? Where do I begin ? Is that your father 's watch ? What makes you ask that ? That 's a Tag Heuer Monaco . Steve McQueen wore one . If you were a guy back in the '70s , that was a must-have item . My dad thought so , too . He still around ? I don 't know . PILOT ' Uh , Whiskey One , we are approaching naval perimeter . ' ... ' Repeat , approaching naval perimeter . ' MAN Roger that , Whiskey One . Proceed with caution . 'Naval perimeter has been secured . ' Listen up , people , we need to secure the entire ship . Get down below deck , see if you can get the power on line ! Heads up , gentlemen , one crew member down . Dr. Caffrey ! I 'm here . We 're clean down here Dr. Caffrey , no pathogens , ... no chemical toxins , no radiological activity . The crew ? We 've found five of them so far - all dead . Some of them are pretty deformed . According to the ship 's manifest , there were 13 crew members on board . Where are the rest of them ? We don 't know . Get your team ready , you 're up . We 're on our way . eeeeeuuuuuhhhhh ! eeeeeuuuuuhhhhh ! We had to tranq him . His name is Gunneson , First Mate . All right , um , Mr. Cavennaugh , I 'd like your men to search the ship for any additional life forms . Freighters like this always have stowaways : rats , roaches , silverfish ... Capture them alive , if possible . Dr. Fenway , you 're going to have your hands full . I want a full workup on Gunneson here and those corpses and whatever potential menagerie we find . May I ask what it is I 'm supposed to be looking for ? If we knew that , we could all go home . What about the ship 's computers ? There might be a-a log or outgoing e-mails - anything that can tell us what happened . We 'll check it out . You said you saw some kind of ghost images on the ship 's radar equipment . Yeah , odd patterns , definitely more than just static . Ramsey , take a look . Lucas , there 's a video camera in the Rec Room . Let 's run it . Okay . Call us when he comes to . Yeah . Nice try . Nice try . Watch the magic . Oh-ho ! Oh-ho-oo ! Who got game ? ! Who got game ? ! Huh ? Who got game ? ! Who got game ? ! All right . Uh , Lucas , you 're the engineer . Any idea what we 're seeing here ? No obvious means of propulsion , no aerodynamic surfaces . My God , look at the way it 's folding in on itself . It 's almost like we 're dealing with some kind of higher dimensional geometry , maybe a Kaluza-Klein Manifold . English , please . It means I just soiled my boxers just a little bit . Come on , come on . I think we 're looking at a four-dimensional object in three-dimensional space . You see how it keeps morphing ? Yeah . I think because we live in a three-dimensional world you see , we 're only capable of seeing part of it . What 's it doing ? What 's that sound ? aaaah ! Oh , my God . ah ! uh ! Are you guys all right ? ! Yeah . Congratulations , Gentlemen . We 've just accomplished the first task of Threshold : Confirmation of extraterrestrial intelligence . So , you 're telling me you 've got nothing more than an amateur videotape ? No , I 'm telling you what 's on that videotape will keep our scientists busy for decades . I 'm not interested in the future . I 'm interested in now . Who are they ? Why are they here ? Come on , dazzle us with some of your celebrated conjecture . And you 'll have to do it quickly , Molly . The North Koreans caught some friendly currents . They 're due to arrive a few hours early . Understood . J.T. , any thoughts ? Look at all those sorry bastards out there . They have no idea what just dropped into our lap . They 're driving home , bitching about traffic , thinking about happy hour , just going about their lives ... and it could all be over . We don 't know that . We do our jobs right , they 'll never know how close we came . Molly 's going to need someone to run interference for her , J.T. Mm . You know how treacherous Washington bureaucracy can be . She 'll be pulling resources from every conceivable government branch . You reassigning me ? Temporarily . Thought I was on track for your job . Right now , you have the more important one . He 's in a delicate state , probably post-traumatic stress . I 'm not sure you 'll get much out of him . Did you find the captain ? No , he-he 's missing . So is most of the crew . Of the people we have been able to find , you 're the only survivor . Good . And why is that good ? Because they changed . We looked at the videotape . Can you tell us what happened ? I don 't know where it came from . We heard a sound first . Then the equipment started acting funny . It was blinding . And the sound - like knives being sharpened Whoo-hoo . See that ? When we came to , it was gone . Power was on backup . Then the crew started getting sick ... really sick ... having weird dreams ... There was nothing I could do . These boys need help , Captain . We should call in an airlift . Captain ? It was like a forest , but the trees were made of glass . Sir , why don 't we get you down to sick bay ? In the dream I had ... in the forest ... Sir ? It was like I was really there . - uhh ! - aah ! aaayyy ! - uhh ! aahh ! ehh ! And we never saw the captain again . Never found his body . After that , everything went to hell . People trying to kill each other ; trying to kill themselves . I hid in sick bay , but I could still hear the screaming . And the missing crew members ? Do you know where they went ? No . What about the bodies we found ? What caused those disfigurements ? Listen , people weren 't the same . They weren 't themselves . What about you ? Are you yourself ? Take it easy , Buddy . Take it easy . You okay ? Yeah . No , actually , I 'm not okay . I 'm completely freaked out . I 'd be worried if you weren 't . Any thoughts on our mystery object ? You mean that Christmas ornament there ? Look , designing spacecraft is what I do . And theoretically , there are only so many ways you can get from one star to another . Laser-assisted solar sails , fusion engines , interstellar ramjets , antimatter drives . And I got to tell you ... this thing definitely doesn 't use any of those . So what does it do ? Do you think it was carrying passengers ? You saw what it was doing , folding in on itself . Where would they be ? An unmanned probe , then . Possibly . Or a weapon . Right . After don 't you cut him down and get him to Dr. Fenway . Takes real commitment to hang yourself . My boy here was motivated . Something must 've really scared the crap out of him . You wanted to see me ? Yeah , I got a little bit of alien voodoo I want to run past you here . Now , this interference pattern , it appears on every bit of equipment on this ship . What 's causing it ? We really should go out some time . What ? ... You don 't date guys ... smarter than you ? I don 't know . Never met one . Now , as to what 's causing this pattern , remember the bomb they dropped over Hiroshima ? The explosion was so hard core that it permanently burnt shadows of people onto the walls and sidewalks . I think we have the electromagnetic equivalent here . What about the shape itself ? I 've got some ideas but I need to do a Fourier analysis before I really nail it down . Hold on , guys ! I want to get some shots before you bag him . Meticulous . Details matter . I think I saw that embroidered on a pillow once . You know , Caffrey , you didn 't have to concoct this whole alien conspiracy theory just to get the two of us alone together . You 're boring me , Ramsey . You get that , or you need me to embroider it on a pillow for you ? Ah ... ha , I have to amuse myself somehow . You know , thanks to you , this might be my last job ... ever . You ever consider that - I mean , did you think about that when you picked our names out of a hat ? I was having a perfectly deviant life s ... uh , huh , uh It 's not all that unusual . Post-mortem muscle contractions , neuro - electrical discharges . Discharge ? This guy was doing the Macarena . Look , all I know is h-his eyes were focused . There was consciousness . So maybe our definition of dead just changed . Okay ... give me a couple of hours . I 'll see if I can get you some answers Any luck ? I asked our naval escorts to do another sonar sweep , but so far , nothing . So that thing on tape wasn 't tracked leaving by air . Not underwater ... Where the hell did it go ? Nervous ? You really thrive on this crisis stuff , don 't you ? Is it that obvious ? Worst case scenarios ? I mean , what kind of person picks that for a job description ? The kind of person who lived through one . You know what , Doc ? I 've been thinking . Uh-oh . I don 't know if that object was even a spacecraft . The way it was built , it could never carry passengers . It must have been sent here for another purpose . Huh . Whoa . Hey , there 's a wedding ring on this hand . They ever find the guy this belonged to ? Nope . Doesn 't that bother you ? What bothers me is that we 're working our butts off here , and nobody 's said Bo Diddley about whether we 're being paid for this or not . I 'm not worried about that . I think we got bigger fish to fry . Well , you 're not carrying three ex-wives on your back , are you ? You know , Doc ... This ... this is about the science . This is about the sense of discovery . Are you kidding me ? You think people give a flying fart about science ? The day the Mars Rover landed , what was the top story in the news ? I don 't know . Britney Spears married in Vegas ! I don 't know . Given the state of the world today , a little alien intervention might be just what the doctor ordered . So you 're bitter is what you 're saying . Wait , wait ... What the hell is this ? Come here , Lucas . So have you figured out what we 're looking at ? If I give you the wrong answer , are you gonna make me choose a door again ? It 's a fractal pattern . Fractional geometry , a type of mathematics that crops up in chaos theory . What does it have to do with our UFO ? Could be some form of communication . Math is a language , and like any language , it speaks to us . This pattern is speaking to me . What 's it saying ? It 's a graphic representation of an equation that describes a DNA molecule . Here . Now ... our DNA , the DNA of every life-form on Earth , is in the shape of the - of the double helix . - double helix . So you actually took more than phys-ed . Keep going , Ramsey . Now , if I translate into mathematics what this pattern is describing , things get a little bit bizarre . A triple helix . I can 't even imagine what life based on a triple helix would look like . Well , maybe we 're about to find out . Huh . Whatever it is , it can 't be good for the human race Okay , guys , let 's think . We 're up against the wall here . Who are they ? Why are they here ? What do they want ? Doctor , you said you found something unusual ? Well , that 's putting it mildly . These are normal human blood cells . This is a sample of blood taken from our survivor . I found the same structural changes in the corpses and in the rats and roaches , for that matter . Something evoked frighteningly-rapid cellular change in every living thing on this boat . It 's not unlike the work of a viral agent . Li-Like cancer , but more directed in its purpose . Exactly . The ship 's clean - we didn 't find any pathogens . This is what puzzled me , and then I started thinking . Most of our genetic material is obsolete . Fact is , we don 't know what most of it does , but ... what if someone else did ? What if , wha-what if they figured out a way to manipulate it ? How ? With our mystery object ? With all those lights and sounds ? Nah , you ... you can 't hack into someone 's DNA with a signal . Really ? Used a cell phone lately ? Brain tumors , chief . Even watching a second - generation copy made us sick . Yeh ... which reminds me , Doctor , I 'm going to have to take blood samples of the three of you , as well . Ramsey , you said the shape was articulating something . Well , I 'm down with Fenway . Someone 's trying to unzip our DNA strands and reassemble them . So ... w-w-what ? W - W we 're talking about some kind of bio-forming ? You 've heard of terraforming altering the climate of Mars to make habitable . Why not do the same thing to people ? Say you want to colonize another world . What do you do , send troops , an armada of spaceships ? Wouldn 't it be more efficient if you could simply send information ? I - I-If-if you could download a program i - into the indigenous population , and ... and turn them into you ? Uh , okay , hold on , though . We don 't know they 're trying to colonize . This could be their way of saying hello . Listen , my ridiculously optimistic little friend , I know how to say ' hello in over 200 dialects , and this most certainly is not a ' hello . ' Cavennaugh . Roger that . We 're evacuating . I was told we had at least another 90 minutes . What the hell are you doing ? ! The North Koreans are breathing down our necks , so unless you want to stare down a 2,000-ton sub ... Are you blowing up the ship ? We can 't destroy the only evidence of alien life we 've ever had . Look , you have to make do with what you 've got . We can 't afford to let them get their hands on it . The less they know about what we found out here , the better . Hey , we got to go . Come on , Molly . Hahggg ! Gunneson , stop ! Stop ! Turn around ! Aahh ! AAHH ! Gaahhh ! uh-hu ! Gaahh ! huy ! aaaahhh ! oohf ! uuhh ! Gunneson ! Stay back ! You okay ? Yeah . I think it 's safe to say we are dealing with a worst-case scenario , so we move on to Phase Two of the Threshold protocols : containment and crisis-management . Now , there 's a lot we don 't know . Like where are the missing crew members ? Where is First Mate Gunneson ? Sleeping with the fishes , no doubt . No one could have survived out there , much less made it to shore . We can assume nothing , Doctor . The minute we give in to our preconceptions , we 're dead . Which brings us to our object . Where did it go ? We 're plugged into every surveillance satellite in the hemisphere . I can tell you this : It certainly hasn 't left . If it was here , we would 've found it by now . Not necessarily . If their technology is based on four ... or ... or even five dimensional physics , they could come and go , and we 'd never even know it . We have to assume we 're dealing with an intelligence so advanced that its capabilities border on the supernatural . That 's comforting . There 's nothing comforting about this . Look , uh ... we don 't have time for fear . We don 't have the-the luxury of self-doubt . We 've got to stare into the face of the unknown and make damn sure we don 't blink . Why don 't you come back tomorrow afternoon ? We 'll run another round of tests . So , uh , what is that , a battlefield scar ? Some 'm like that . Whoever stitched you up should be making shoes for a living Let me ask you something . I understand what I 'm doing here ... the others ... What exactly is your job title ? I mean , who ... cuts your checks ? I 'm freelance . I do contract work . So you 're a ghost , huh ? You 're the guy they send in when they can 't acknowledge they 've sent someone in . Should we be worried ? No . I , uh , ... haven 't found any cellular damage or mutations . So we 're clean . Sort of . I , uh , picked up some unusual activity in your mid to lower frontal lobes , both of you . Lucas , too . Are you saying we 're sick ? No , no , no , we 're talking brain wave activity . You see these ? These are theta waves . You 're all generating far more than the average cognitive model . You 're saying the videotape changed the way we think ? May be . Anyway , uh ... I can 't see any reason to keep you here now . My advice : get some rest . Even ' ghosts ' need sleep , right ? Hey , don 't you ever sleep ? Can 't . I 'm still drowning in satellite telemetry . I just feel like we missed something . Oh , drown tomorrow . Go home . Y-y-no-you 're no good to us fried . You 're still here . Yeah , well , I don 't have a life . What makes you think I do ? Huh . Guess I know who to call when Thanksgiving comes around . Look , get some rest . We 'll need you back here in eight hours . Good night . Come here , mister . 'Stop me ! ' 'What was in the ship ? ' ah-huh ! Hello ? It 's Cavennaugh . You okay ? Yeah . Why ? I just had this dream . I - I can 't explain it , but I saw myself ... but it wasn 't me . I know this is going to sound strange , but ... it-it ... it felt like more than just a dream . And there-there was this place . It was like I was really there . It was ... it was like a forest . It was a-a glass forest . Molly ? Yeah . Sorry , uh ... I - I saw it , too . I was there . What 's happening to us ? I don 't know . Gunneson ! Ouch ! alle ! ooh ! aahh ! - errrraah ! - agghhh ! errrraah ! eeh ! gahhh ! uuhh ! uh ... k you 're ... uh you 're not ... yourself ! We can help you ! Pleeeezz ? ! Su-foe-noe-ruoy yaaaaaaaahhhhhhh ! aahhh ! aaahhhh ! oi-va-ah ! YAH ! Federal agents . Federal agents . - What ? - Whoa , whoa . Orders from Cavennaugh . We 've had your entire team under surveillance . He-He-Heee 's down there ! Lights ! Where are they ? There-there 's a switch on-on ... ah ... on the post to the right ! He 's not here . Well , that 's impossible . We 've searched the whole room . He 's not down here . All right , talk to me . It was Gunneson . How is that even possible ? Are you telling me he swam 80 miles to shore after getting shot four times ? It 's a good question . It 's not like he could have grabbed a life preserver . We blew up his damn ship . And how 'd he find this house ? Why come here ? Look , there 's a lot of folks checking this out . What 's our cover story ? We 're saying it was a home invasion , attempted rape . Oh , yeah , Caffrey 's gonna love that . What about the local police ? Who 's Bigfooting them ? I already took care of it . Told them we were FBI . All right . Getting your hands dirty , Fenway ? umm ... not that often I get to practice my forensics . Spend most of my days in a lab chatting with test tubes and cell cultures . Glamorous life of a pathologist . Well , I brought you a coffee . It 's okay to set this here ? Don 't spill it . What have you got ? Footprints . I can see that . We 'll run an analysis of the soil , see if we can ... backtrack how he got here . Well , I 'm guessing he didn 't take a cab . You old enough to drink coffee ? Oh. huh-huh , uhh-no thanks . Never after nine o 'clock . Besides , I 'm wired enough as it is . Anything ? Plenty . I 'm picking up some weird magnetic anomalies here , which is interesting in itself , but this is really unnerving . Looks like Gunneson left us a parting gift . Is it the same pattern you saw on the ship ? It was on all the electronic displays . You have any strange dreams last night ? Beg your pardon ? As I understand it , Dr. Caffrey and Mr. Cavennaugh both had the same nightmare , saw similar things . Yeah , I heard that , I heard that . You watched the same videotape of the UFO they did . You were the only three . Figured you might have had the dream , too . I hardly slept last night . No dreams . You sure about that , my friend ? Yeah , I 'm positive . There 's nothing wrong with us , right ? Dr. Fenway tested our blood . He said we 're not infected . Our theta-waves are a little off . It 's no big deal . Let me know what else you find . You doing all right ? Thanks . 290 million people in the United States , and he makes his way to your front door . Why ? I don 't know . But the more disturbing question is , how did he find me ? You didn 't get one for me ? I could use a jolt . Is that my underwear your hands ? Yes . Drop it ! Did Gunneson say anything to you ? He ... He was trying , but , his , uh ... his words were all mixed up . If I 'd heard it , I could have helped . Too bad we don 't have a recording . Actually , we do . You had my house bugged ? Just interpreting your plan . 'Safety of the Red Team at all costs , ' right ? uh ... k you 're ... uh you 're not ... yourself ! We can help you ! Pleeeezz ? ! Su-foe-noe-ruoy Su-foe-noe-ruoy yaaaaaaaahhhhhhh ! Doesn 't make sense to me . Well , that 's because you 're not a linguist . It 's word salad . Expressive aphasia . Common in stroke victims . They garble their words , they say things backwards . God knows what was happening to Gunneson on a neurological level , but I think it might be something similar . Now , if we play it backwards , we get this . You 're one of us . You 're one of us . You 're one of us . You 're one of us The signal from that object affected every living thing on the boat . If Gunneson made it to shore , chances are , the other crew members survived , as well . So , we 're dealing with a total of seven potential alien infectees . Got Captain Manning , Lieutenant Novak , Crewmen Sanford , Sonntag , Park and Pena . We 've got to find them . Containment is the first priority , per the Threshold Protocols . We 've already begun surveying their homes , family members and friends . Uh , I 'm sorry , but has anyone stopped to think that maybe we should be staking out ourselves ? I 've doubled the watch on all of you . We 're covered . Like she was covered ? By the way , what are we gonna tell these guys ' families ? Their sons died at sea . Oh-ho . That 's gonna go over great when they show up on Mom 's doorstep covered in seaweed . Can we move on now ? Fire away . Signal telemetry ? It 's an engineer 's middle name . What about it ? I need you to break that signal down into its mathematical components . Uh , look for any pattern or form of communication . Ramsey , you can help him out . Now , Fenway , you said the signal was modifying human DNA . W - We need more specifics . Yeah , like , can the process be reversed ? Can we inoculate ourselves against it ? If you want me to figure out how this ' bio-forming ' works , I 'm gonna need a live specimen . Then we 'll get you one . And his name is Gunneson . Whatever else is happening , I think a part of him genuinely came to me for help . I ... I could see it in his eyes . There 's a war going on inside him . Uh , hey , uh , guys , can I talk to you for a second ? Uh , I don 't know if you 're aware of this or not , but I 'm supposed to be getting married in six weeks . We 're aware . Oh , ok-uh-okay , so What am I supposed to tell my fiancee ? I mean , uh , I 've been gone for two days . You 're not telling her anything . We 'll take care of it . What is that supposed to mean ? As far as I 'm concerned , the entire Red Team should be sequestered until this whole mess is over . Especially after what happened last night . No , it 's counterproductive . I ... I already ... I already covered this in the plan . If we strip these people of their support systems , they won 't be able to function as well . As long as we 're asking our team members to relocate , we need to do the same with any spouses or family members . You 're confident of that ? Absolutely . Part of crisis management is looking after the welfare of your team . Lose sight of that , and we end up with a plan that 's gonna fall apart faster than we can make a new one . Then I guess I 'll defer to you . We 're already drafting a cover story for your work here . We 'll see if we can 't fold your intended into it , as well . Much appreciated . I found traces of sodium , sulfur and calcium in the mud from these boot prints . That doesn 't give us much . Those elements are found everywhere . Mm-mmm . Not in this particular combination . Spent activated alumina . It 's used to remove arsenic in water treatment facilities . We 've got three possibilities . Three different water treatment facilities in the metro area . It 's this one , just south of Cape Charles . How do you know ? Larkspur . I ... I smelled it on him . The flowers are farm-harvested near the canal but they 're everywhere All right . So Gunneson headed to this refinery after he made landfall . The question is , why ? Let 's grab Ramsey . If Gunneson 's there , we may need a translator . Can I talk to you a sec ? Yeah . Uhm ... you know the blood spatter Lucas found in your bathroom ? The one that congealed into Ramsey 's fractal pattern ? Well , it wasn 't Gunneson 's . It was yours . But ... but you said I didn 't have any cellular damage . You don 't . So why in God 's name would my blood do that ? That 's a good question . What happened to this man ? Apparently , he wasn 't too keen on the ... alien signal . It caused a sudden and catastrophic implosion throughout his entire body . See this thing that looks like a peach pit here ? That was his heart . Poor son of a bitch . How come this didn 't happen to all the crewmen ? I don 't know , something ... something unique in his DNA or ... He was found holding a cell phone . Maybe that was it . Maybe he was just standing in the wrong place . And the blood pattern I found on the bathroom floor , I understand it 's Caffrey 's ? That 's right . How worried should we be about that ? You know , that 's a good question . And again , I don 't have the answer . When I find something ... you 'll be the first to know . That 's fair enough . Is there something else I can do for you ? I need your wallet . hah ... are you mugging me ? Because I 'm a little busy right now . I want to check everyone 's organ donor status . We already have three members affected by the signal . No telling what might happen next . We can 't risk anyone from Threshold having their insides spread out among the general population . Can 't this wait ? I 'm afraid not . While we 're on the subject of invading my privacy , would you mind telling me who 's been censoring my e-mails ? Come again ? I sent two e-mails to my brother in Boston . From his responses , clearly ... he hasn 't been getting everything I wrote . Then I suggest you write shorter letters . What 's that supposed to mean ? You mentioned you were working with Molly Caffrey , that you were involved with something classified . sensitive information , my friend . What are my rights here , exactly ? You have the full complement of rights guaranteed to every American . Mm-hmm . What if I decided to walk outside and go to the store ? Well , what do you need ? That 's not the point . Am I free to come and go as I please ? We 'll provide you with anything you need . All right . I need a tennis ball , some baby carrots , a number three pencil and a vintage Hohner harmonica 542 Golden Melody ... with its original case . You 'll get a new license by the end of the day . Here , keep it . Don 't you need it ? Carry two . Gave me the girl gun . A revolver 's more reliable . It won 't jam like an automatic . When we have time , I 'll take you to the range . I shot Gunneson four times ... ... didn 't even slow him down . Yeah , well , after what happened on that ship , I had all our ordnance switched to explosives . Should cause a lot more damage . Right now , I want you to aim for the ten-spot , the heart . Okay ? If your aim was better , you might 've put him down for good . My aim was good enough to save your life . It 's not mine I 'm worried about . Afternoon , sir . Mind if we ask you a few questions ? Questions ? Yeah , we have reason to believe a suspect we 're investigating has taken refuge in there . Factory 's closed . - - Cavennaugh - We 're aware of that . There 's no one here . All the same , we 'd like to take a look . Copy that . We 're getting warmer . Couple of the boys found a lifeboat from the Big Horn about a mile up the shoreline . Great , at least now we know he didn 't walk on water . So when was this facility shut down ? I don 't know . What did they manufacture here ? I don 't know . Do you know who was on duty last night ? No . Oh , wow , do I feel safe with Ricky Retardo working the case here . Guys ! Over here . He was definitely here . This is from the boot print we lifted at my house - Gunneson 's Look . The tread pattern 's an exact match . Yea , you 've got at least four other sets of prints here , as well . The other crewmembers . Well , you don 't know that . Could 've been anyone . Different sizes , maybe , but they 're all the same pattern . I ran Gunneson 's impression through the database . It 's a WORX steel-toed boot made by Red Wing . Now , the Big Horn was a Naval freighter . These boots are standard issue . So we 're not just dealing with Gunneson anymore . At least four of them made it to shore . They definitely didn 't meet here by accident . They 're congregating . Cavennaugh . 'We 're in the building just south of you . ' 'Looks like there 's some blood here . ' We 're on our way . 'Roger that . ' That 's disgusting . Isn 't it ? So the big guy in there used to be one of the roaches on the ship ? Mm-hmm . I 've been watching him mutate for the last 48 hours . Okay , check out what he does next . He 'll keep doing that all night long , over and over again . The fractal pattern ? Part of it , anyway . You really think we 're okay , Doc ... me and Dr. Caffrey and Cavennaugh ? Well , medically , yeah . I haven 't found anything to cause me worry - ... a few spikes in your theta-waves . Weird stuff , yeah , but not worry kind of stuff . That theta-wave business , that 's not something I can pass on to my fiancee , right ? Honestly , I have no idea . Why don 't you just keep your mitts off of her till we know what we 're doing here ? Didn 't you say you had some kind of theory about the signal ? Yeah . Let me show you . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! What do you think you 're doing ? It 's okay . There 's no audio on this tape . So ? So the audio 's what we need to be worried about . I ran the tape through a spectral frequency analysis . It 's what we do with the imaging data we get back from our deep space probes . The camera picks up more than the human eye can see , anyway . Here it is in infrared . Ultraviolet . As far as I can tell , the visual component is inert . It 's harmless . J - Just to be safe , I 'd like to explore this further with proper clinical trials . Okay . Fair enough . But here 's the point . I 've been dissecting the auditory components from the tape . And , we struck gold . See , the signal 's miles deep . It 's made up of hundreds of different harmonics ... some of them are even beyond our technological ability to measure . That could be the hyperdimensional characteristics of our UFO could be something else . But what we need to do is start pulling out and isolating the individual sub-signals ... like this one . Or this one . ... see how they affect your average living organism . Exactly . Might even tell us how our Average Joe Cockroach managed to Hulk out into Skeletor Roach over there . Wu ... wait a minute , w ... w ... play that one back again . Loop it . Look at these guys ! The brown ones are getting awfully agitated . The brown ones are from the ship , right ? Yeah . And the white ones are our controls , but they 're not affected . Give yourself a gold star , Mr. Pegg . Do you have a key for this ? No . Shoot it . Get Down ! Don 't move ! Stop ! This is Cavennaugh . I 've lost him . Make sure the area is secure . Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa ! What in the hell ? Say hello to our real security guard . So that guy I was just chasing ... Yeah , hold on . It 's Sonntag . One of our missing crewmen . Son of a bitch shaved . What ? Where 's Ramsey ? Ramsey ? Ramsey . Hey , Ramsey . Ramsey . RAMSEY ! Ramsey ! You gave us quite a scare , Ramsey . Thought you might 've been kidnapped or something . 'Otay ebay , oray otnay otay ebay . ' Come again ? 'To be or not to be' in pig Latin . Yea , very impressive . You-ah ... finished going AWOL ? I 'm just saying , to ' not be , ' heh , that 's a big deal . It 's not really my cup of tea . How 'd you find me ? Oh , we planted a tracking chip on you . Yea , don 't worry , you won 't find it . It 's under your skin . Eh-heh , you like playing Big Brother , don 't you ? Well , I 'm sorry to disappoint you , but , you know , ... hah , hah , I 'm outta here . Yeah , we figured as much . It 's okay , though . We got uh-a replacement for you already lined up . It turns out you were actually number two on Caffrey 's list . Yeah , number one just became available . Oh , really ? Yeah , Andre Novakovitch . Novakovitch ? That little math bitch ? He 's all smoke and mirrors . Isomorphic group therapy . Monotonic null sequences . Quadratic reciprocity . Blah , blah , blabbety-blah . Come up with something new . Please . So , you want back in , then ? I can 't . When I saw that agent ... get shot right in front of me , I knew I was out . Hey , he 'll live . He was wearing a vest . You see a lot of guys die ? A few . You get used to that ? Unfortunately , yes . See , that 's what I 'm afraid of . Pleeeezz ? ! Su-foe-noe-ruoy Su-foe-noe-ruoy ! yaaaaaaaahhhhhhh ! 'You 're one of us . ' 'You 're one of us . ' Molly ? 'You 're one ... ' You all right ? Yeah , I was just , uh , going over this stuff . So how 's it going ? Trying to get inside Gunneson 's head . I read his file a dozen times , his service records . Even his high school transcripts . Sounds like you 're covering all the bases . Well , we can 't find him , and we came face-to-face today with another crewman and he got away , so ... I - I think I 'm running out of bases to cover , you know ? You knew this would happen , sooner or later . What , aliens ? Your contingency plans . Viral outbreaks , international monetary collapse . And , uh , what was the one you wrote in ' 97 ? Uh , cataclysmic shift in the polar ice caps . Mmm . Sounding pretty good right about now . Reality scaring you a little ? Little more than a little . Look , I remember something that someone once said ... 'Focus on the task , not the fear of the task . ' Heh , heh , - I can 't believe you remember that . You wrote a hell of a thesis . It was the only ' A' I gave out that year . Maybe the author should keep her own words in mind . Brown ones are from the ship . Each of them shows signs of cellular mutation . The white ones , on the other hand , are a basic laboratory stock , They 're unaffected by the signal . We 've been dissecting the audio signal from the videotape , experimenting with different harmonic components . And the one we 're about to play for you has produced some interesting results . Remember , this is only part of the signal , - a sub-harmonic ; not enough to cause harm to any of us . I 'll be damned . How many times have you run this test ? Dozens . And everytime it 's had the same result ? Mm-hmm . Do you think it could have the same effect on an infected human ? Well , yeah ... Whoa , whoa . G-Guys . Experimenting with rats in a controlled environment is one thing . We take this out in the open , we could be playing with fire . We already are . Listen , before they tested the atomic bomb , Edward Teller theorized the entire atmosphere may go up in flames . But they went ahead and tested it , anyway . Why ? Because there was a war going on . Who 's to say that 's not the case now ? Look , we 've already instituted a nationwide manhunt . We 're staking out all of the crewmen 's friend and family . So far , we 've come up with nothing . So we try something new . It wouldn 't be called risk management if there weren 't any risks involved . I say we make our own RangaTang lure . They 've got these little sonar lures . I use them when I fish peacock bass out at Lake Okeechobee . The lures beep imitate the croaking sounds of the bait fish . We can do the same thing with your signal here , see if we can 't snag Gunneson . Or see if we can 't snag all of them . Hey , you guys seen the van ? It 's pretty tricked out . It 's like top-of-the-line surveillance gear and cool night-vision scopes . Only the best for Threshold . Who makes this stuff , anyway ? So , are we sure about this little plan of yours ? I mean , aren 't we going to be in proximity of the signal ? It 's a sub-harmonic . We 'll be fine . All right . I just hope you know what you 're doing . Hey , Nigel ? Baylock said this is for you . For me ? Hmm . I always wondered what doctors carry in their little black bags . Dr. Fenway ? Just some ... supplies I requested . It 's been three hours . What do you think ? I think humans aren 't rats . Maybe we need more bait . Lucas ? Go ahead , Dr. Caffrey . Let 's amp the signal a little more . 'Are you sure about that ? We really don 't know what effects ... ' Just amp the signal . 'Okay . Stand by . ' So , I heard you 're getting hitched . That was the plan , anyway . Well , if you 're having second thoughts , you 've got the perfect excuse . Which is what ? Alien invasion , jackass . Why are you even still here ? Aren 't you supposed to be making your-ah big getaway ? Oh , he chickened out . He couldn 't stand the thought of Novakovitch stealing his thunder . So you really don 't know where your father is ? Whether he 's dead or alive ? So what happened ? What 's the story ? You didn 't read my file ? I skimmed it . He disappeared when I was younger . Want me to try to find him ? Bet I could . If you 'd asked me that two days ago , I might 've said yes . Now , I don 't know . All the things I thought mattered to me ... Maybe they matter more . You got movement in Zone Three . 'Copy that . Zone Three . ' 'I 've got a visual . Stand by . ' 'Negative , sir . It 's a dog . ' It 's just a dog . So , three times , huh ? Down the aisle ? Yep . How 'd you keep working up the nerve ? Weren 't you worried each one was going to end up like the last one ? Unfortunately , it didn 't occur to me . Would you ever do it again ? Given our present circumstances , I suppose anything 's possible . I was worried you were going to talk me out of it . No , don 't worry , Lucas , because I really don 't care . You know , a cynic is an idealist with a broken heart . Thank you , Dr. Phil . Hey , Rhonda here just got her boobs done , and they garnered a very enthusiastic round of applause from the audience . Yay . Oh , sor ... sorry to interrupt your poignant moment there . 'Lucas , you there ? ' Yeah , go ahead . 'We 're not registering a signal from the transponder ... ' ' ... on the eastern perimeter . Can you take a look ? ' Yeah . On my way . Looks okay to me . Dr. Caffrey ? Hello ? We 're connected , you and I. Did you know that ? All of us are . We 're drawn to each other . We can 't help it . God created man in His image . This is no different . You want to scream for your friends ? Go ahead . Scream all you want . Scream ! Guys ... Hey , guys . Guys ! Help ! He 's here ! HELP ME ! HAAA ! Bad dream ? Sorry , no ... I 'm great . 'Great ' ? How do you define that adjective exactly ? Because you certainly don 't look great to me . Hey , the situation 's getting to all of us ... some more than others . Listen , I 've got some great sedatives handy , if ya ... if you want to take the edge off . I said I 'm fine ! Ah ! Caffrey ! Caffrey ! It 's Gunneson ! He 's got Lucas ! He 's got Lucas ! Do you see ? Now ? I had to come . We 're all connected . 'We 've acquired the target . ' He 's on the move . Remember , we need him alive . 'I 've got him in my sight . ' He 's in Zone One . 'Copy that . Zone One . ' He 's heading for us . 'I 've got him in my sight . 'Missed the target . He 's out of my range . ' What just happened ? ' ... target ' Zone One , negative on the target . That 's a negative on the target . Repeat . It 's a negative on the target . Where is he ? ' zone 3 , negative on the target 'We have nothing . ' No , nobody just falls of the radar like that . That 's exactly what happened to me last night . H - He disappeared . Molly , what are you doing ? He showed up at my house . He 's looking for me . No ... ! Molly ... GUNNESON ? ! It 's Molly ! I 'm right here ! I wanna talk to you ! I 'm right here ! Gunneson ! oomph ! You don 't want to shoot me . Don 't you understand ? You 're one of us . No . I 'm not . Now ! Move in ! aaaaahhhhh ! screaming ; buzzing ; shouting ! I guess you just weren 't feeling the part about capturing a live specimen . - He 's alive . - ... ish . Now we know they 're vulnerable . We got him , that 's what 's important . Let 's get him back to Threshold and run every test we got . You doing all right ? Yeah , I 'm just wondering do you think he came here because of the signal or because of us ? Maybe we were the bait . Just be glad only one of them showed up . Uh ... if we 're still broadcasting , you might want to ixnay on the ignalsay . Stay down , remain calm , and no one will be hurt . I told you , I don 't know why I 'm here . I went out for a drive and I ended up in this place . Either charge me with something or let me go ! Mirandize me , or I 'm walkin ' right now , pig ! Excuse me . - What 's your name ? - Paul . Why are you here , Paul ? Why did you come here ? I don 't know . Ever catch this many bass when you went fishing ? No . Man , let me go ! We got some righ ... Man , answer my questions , or someth ... So . Doctor Caffrey ... anything in those protocols of yours on how we 're going to spin this one ? We gonna have to put all these people into custody ? Not necessarily . We 've managed to work our way through about 60 of them so far . We 've done buccal-mucosal swabs , various blood panels . Based on the preliminary DNA sequencing that we 've been running , I 'm not detecting any cellular mutations . No triple-helix . I don 't think these people have been infected . Then what the hell are they doing here ? - Well ... - Look ... We were operating under the assumption that a-ah , that our our signal fragment would only draw in our missing crew members , but obviously , it had some sort of effect on the ... the general population , as well . So far , all the people we interviewed came from within a five kilometer radius , so it seems like the signal was localized . But there 's got to be tens of thousands of people living in that area . Why didn 't they all show up ? Why just these hundred and six ? Maybe the people who showed up share something in common , some kind of genetic predisposition . Then you need to find out what that is . You know , we dodged a bullet , here today . But we can 't let that happen again . Let 's make sure we have a clean bill of health on the rest of them . Done . Let 's go . So , what 's next in the Threshold playbook ? Well , I want to keep these people under surveillance . There 's no reason to detain them at this point . And then I 'll see you back at Threshold later tonight . I 've got a date with Gunneson . What is up with this traffic ? Arlington 's never packed at this time . And Gunneson said what ? That they were recreating us in their image . How do you know it wasn 't just a regular nightmare ? Basic anxiety ? 'Cause I had the same dream you guys did last night . The one with the trees of glass , and that thing ... that creature . Why didn 't you say anything ? Because I was scared . I still am . I mean ... I know Dr. Fenway said that we 're okay , but I just don 't feel like myself anymore . I know you guys know what I 'm talking about . I mean , your blood turned into the fractal pattern . What does that mean ? Doesn 't it bother you ? Just a little bit ? What 's happening is bad , really bad ! I 'm not going to lie to you , Lucas . I - I 'm scared too , we 'd be insane not to be . we 're going to stick together ... and get through this . How can you say that , though ? You don 't know what we 're fighting . What 's the alternative ? Give up ? Pretend that this isn 't happening ? Is that going to make you feel safer ? Look at me . We have a plan ... and so far , it 's working . We got Gunneson , and we 're going to get the rest of them . Okay ? We just have to stick to the plan . Subtitles by ELLE Corrected for DVD : awaqeded - addic7ed. com

 The latest serum has surpassed expectations . The test subject has grown five times normal size within days of the serum being introduced into its system . But the only known side effect is aggressive behaviour that requires constant feeding to maintain a higher metabolic rate . constant sedation of the subject is needed but the results are very promising . Regeneration only occurs when there is immediate introduction of the serum into the wounded area . My past attempts to save older decomposed or severely damaged tissue have failed . The latest genetic modifications to the black-orchid strain have had the predicted effect on the serum extract . The serum now successfully provides the apparent benefit of halting decomposition of living tissue . would rev olutionise medicine if properly applied . sir . Come in . sorry to disturb you . Mr. Eugene has arrived . sir . please . Sir . There 's a briefcase over there . Have a look inside . That 's $ 1 million . It 's yours if you 'll do a little job for me . I 'm listening . Sit . There 's a cottage in a forest not far from here where an employee of mine has been conducting certain experiments the outcome of which may be beneficial to my health . But here 's the thing . We 've lost contact with him . He appears to have disappeared . His experiments were successful ? I believe so . I believe he created a new hybrid of the blood orchid and that the serum works . And that 's why he 's gone missing because he has found another employer . I want you to collect all the plant material all his research notes . Find him and kill him . Just one man ? I should warn you that some say he 's one of the smartest men on the planet . He may have one or two tricks up his sleeve . This is a lot of money for one man . I have invested over $ 50 million dollars in this project and the returns could be incalculable . I want results no matter what the cost . One other thing . There 's a photo of a girl in there who is also involved with the project . She knows too much . Should she cross your path remove her from the equation . It would be my pleasure . That 's what I wanted to hear . One other thing . Time is of the essence . I have bone cancer . Without this little concoction I would be dead within the week . And that new serum might change that ? that is my hope . sir . Good hunting . How the heck am I supposed to read this ? you . You lost ? we 're They 're officers . I got a little turned around . The map 's in Romanian . I saw something out there . Something big . you see it or hear it ? Both . okay ? what 's your story ? I spend the summers with my grandmother . She lives in a town nearby . Are you guys all cops ? I 'm not . I study flowers . Flowers ? And you have two cops with you ? What are you doing out here ? I 'm studying for a career in palaeopathology . People in town told me there was a dig going on in these mountains so I wanted to check it out . Palaeowhat ? The study of human ancient remains . my friends don 't understand it either . Wait . Wait a sec . You hear that ? No . there 's a predator near . Come on . Are you serious ? What 's your name again ? Alex . I 'm Amanda . you really shouldn 't be out here alone . What the hell is that ? we 're too exposed . We need to take cover . Come on . Yeah . So I 'm working this dig with this hotshot Ph. D. Who 's on sabbatical . And he starts yapping to me about his new methodology and how he 's developed a tool that allows him to dig faster without damaging any artefacts . He also tells me the way we do it is prehistoric and nobody does it that way anymore . So ? So I 'm not done yet . " I 'm not done yet . he drags me over to his site . He hops down in the hole and he immediately proceeds to chop off two of his fingers with this brand-new tool of his . Jackson . I was a little shocked myself . I did ask if he was gonna leave fingers for future generations to uncover . You were jealous he could out-dig you . but he can count to three faster than me . let 's focus . We 're not too far away . if what they say is true this could be one of the most important discoveries on the continent . any news on your brother or Team 1 ? haven 't heard anything yet . honey . man . Yeah . I can 't help it . I am a slave to the rhythm . I am a slave to the rhythm . I wanna take my clothes off . I wanna I wanna touch your body . Great . That 's the last thing we need . Any way around it ? Let me look . Anyone pack a chain saw ? and we 'd be here for days . this is the only route to the base camp . Can we go off-road ? I don 't know . we could go off . We 're not gonna get back on . let 's break it down . We haven 't heard from Team 1 in two days . they didn 't come through here . no cell-phone communication . guys . We 're walking . Are you crazy ? Heather . listen up . Grab your packs and travel light . We 'll get to Team 1 . use the equipment to move this tree . Jackson . Yeah ? Why don 't you head out now ? We 'll hunt the rest of the gear and we 'll meet you halfway . All right . Okay . let 's move . Hey . Did you see that ? What ? Did you hear ? What ? your eyes are playing tricks on you . Come on . It 's been a long drive . Let 's get the rest of the gear out of Jackson 's Jeep . let 's go check this out . you guys stay out here . Okay . Want a flashlight ? I 've got one . I can 't believe he did this . Flowers . you don 't understand . I 've been looking for these flowers . probably twice the potency . Get back . you know how to use this ? right ? Maybe . What the hell are you doing ? Don 't ask questions . You 're gonna blow this place up ? Do you know how to use that stuff ? I know what I 'm doing . I 'll put an end to it . An end to what ? How 'd you get here ? why ? We 'll need it . We 've gotta get about a 100 yards before I blow this place come on . Move . Get in front of me . Move . What about your friends ? They 're probably dead . what the hell is going on ? Just You have no idea . Just keep moving . kid . I 'm right behind you . Where the hell were you ? Right here . there 's a way out . Amanda .

What do you mean ? I didn 't stop and check their wallets . Whatever killed them is still out there . Let 's go . We gotta go . Just calm down . We 're too far . Let 's get to base camp . They are dead at base camp ! Will you calm down five seconds ? we 're too far in . We 'll get to base camp . get a satellite phone and send out an emergency broadcast . You 're wrong . I 'm right . We 're too far in . Now let 's move . Come on . No . let 's go . Come on . Everyone stay together . ladies . Amanda . join the club . All right .

Looks like we 've got company . This fire 's at least a day old . They 're gone . The bodies are gone . right ? Maybe . Like hell it is . Hey . Hey . There were bodies here today . I saw them . what about that is not sinking in with you people ? nobody 's saying you didn 't . Team 1 could 've been transporting the bodies . come on . It wouldn 't take the whole group to take them . Somebody would be here . They 're not out working . They don 't have equipment to work at night . huh ? Where ? Then we have to go looking for them . but not until sunup . Not tonight . We 'll be no good to them if we get lost . we all go . But let me tell you something . If there is something out there it 'll have the advantage at night . True . Tonight we all play it safe . and we rotate lookouts . I know what I saw . Jackson . Jackson . Hey . You scared me . I think I saw something out there . there . I must be hearing things . You see anything ? I know . I should have stayed inside . I don 't know . I don 't know what 's going on here but I know what I saw today . And I got a pretty good idea of what we 're gonna find at the site tomorrow . And I don 't want you to be a part of that . Tomorrow I want you and Wendy to take the van and go back down . why ? Because we 're girls ? this isn 't some kind of contest . but Hey . I don 't want anything to happen to you .

Really ? we 're at a base camp near a cornfield or something . We 're part of the archaeological team working in the area . We need medical help right away . Wendy ! Heather ! Jackson ? Where the hell were you ? my God . Jesus . get me the med kit . It 's in the tent right behind you . Okay . Are you okay ? Yeah . Here you go . Let me help you . Find the keys to the Jeep . I can do that . Be right back . We 'll wait here . Is there something I can do to help ? I don 't know . Where are they ? Where are they ? Murdoch residence . please . Eugene is on the phone . Murdoch . I found the cottage . And ? You didn 't say anything about the snake . I told you he might have a few tricks up his sleeve . That 's the understatement of the year . I had no idea what we could expect . and an extra million for taking out the girl . Forget the girl . Do you have the serum ? I do . Good . Tell your man to meet me . I 'll be ready . It 's all set . Let 's go . it 's okay . Scott showed up . He 's got the keys . Okay . I think Patrick 's stabilised . Right . Let 's grab our gear and get out of here . come on . Look at me . Look at me . Who are you ? all right ? we 've gotta get out of here . Trust you ? You want me to trust you ? Yeah . You know what we just saw out there ? What is it ? Some kind of an experiment ? Exactly . Those men that you saw are here to get the serum . What serum ? They can 't have any witnesses . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? We have to get out of here . They would kill us ? Why not ? It 's the cleanest option . Her . You . You seem to be of a certain value to my client if I 'm allowed . I 'll take that . I 'm looking for I 'm looking for a serum which I 'm sure you know about . Sorry . Don 't . Don 't waste my time . Tell me about this man . What ? I didn 't hear you . Tell me that again . Okay . He 's a scientist that captured a snake . Good . Where is he now ? Answer the question . I don 't know . I 've been looking for him myself . To do what ? To destroy everything that he 's created . right ? It 's gonna pretty be difficult for you to go get that serum with that thing . Who ? You guys are gonna die if you try . you are going to go get it for us . Really ? Why would I do something like that ? Hey . Patrick . Patrick ! What are you doing ? What ? I make him a favour . He 's not suffering anymore . no . no ! no . Jackson . I am gonna kill you the first chance I get . no . Let him go . I 'm liking this . no . why ? no . God . hey . 10 minutes . You are leaving in 10 minutes . You heard what she said . That thing will kill us . but trust me you and your team 's chances of living are better if you go . I 'll send my men to make sure you don 't lose your way . Go . come here . I got you . it 's okay . come on . just come with me . okay ? we 're gonna go . let 's go . Hope you guys pack light in case we gotta move fast . kid . I will . You think we 'll get away with this ? Truth ? Probably not . I 'm here . So let me ask you something . What 's this research about ? I really wanna know . the fountain of youth . Somebody took this orchid and genetically enhanced it which is the chemical basis for the serum . Any snake that ingests this serum can grow 100 times its normal size . And you were chasing it ? Destroying the flowers and research is the only way I could atone for what I did . I 've been waiting every day for any sign that would lead me to these orchids . And this is where they were ? I started hearing strange stories about these animals and people that were disappearing in these hills . Didn 't take a genius to figure it out . Why try it by yourself ? No one believed me . but he 's dead . Sorry . Yeah . Find anything ? No . which is about a half a mile north . You guys wanna chance it ? Snakes are nocturnal . They detect heat . It 's pretty dark out there . Unless you 're feeling lucky . We 'll wait here till sunup . Good . Then we 'll keep looking . What exactly are we looking for ? Anything that references the serum . Hey . you need to eat something . look at me . Look at me . we 're getting out of here . And I need you to have your strength because I can 't do this by myself . And I 'm not leaving you here . You hear me ? I won 't leave you here . I 'm not leaving you . it 's all boring . I just rigged an explosive to the window . nothing gets in . We 're not gonna be able to stall these guys much longer . We better have a plan before sunup . Loose floorboards . Is this what you 're looking for ? that 's it . Nothing else . He 's gotta have the chemical composition written down somewhere . if that thing 's attracted to flowers it 's gonna love this . they find this they 'll kill us both . Exactly . And that 's the serum that causes cell regeneration . What does that mean ? So we can 't kill it . Not if you 're talking about shooting it or cutting its head off . It 's too big . maybe . Maybe ? right ? there 's no way it can heal . Either that or burying it alive . I didn 't say this was gonna be easy . It just doesn 't make sense that this would be all of the serum . Murdoch . He didn 't want Murdoch getting it so he would hide the bulk of it someplace else . Who 's Murdoch ? Murdoch 's the one who financed this nightmare . I 'm gonna put this away just in case . We should get some sleep . what 's going on ? At least somebody 's having fun . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . How good is his smell ? but this stuff is pure concentrate . I 'm stepping out . quick . Ready ? what 's the plan ? kid ? I don 't have a plan . I guess just be ready to move when I do . And if I 'm not here okay ? Okay . if that thing 's attracted to flowers it 's gonna love this . I 'm thinking . what 's the plan ? I 'm thinking ! all right ? I just lost three of my friends ! This is Look . It 's the serum . He must have kept it in here to keep it cool . Great . Now we 've found it . All we gotta do is get back to the camp . Hey . I 'm sorry . Come on . just huh ? This way ? Yeah . How many friends have you lost ? I can 't really talk about that right now . It 's not my mission . This way . You sure ? Yeah . Amanda ! We have the serum . We actually We found it . take it . what 's the problem ? There 's been a change in plans . I 'll be going alone . Give him the bag . hand me the bag . give him the bag . Shut your mouth . back off . We have what your boss asked for . We found what your boss wants . Give him the bag . Give him the bag . Back off . We found it in the give him the bag ! Run ! Go . Come on . Go . run . What are you doing ? No ! Run . Get out . go . sir . Eugene . back inside . I need water for the girl . She 's having convulsions . I 'll watch him . sir ? Terrible . everything is good . Good . Vasile ? What are you doing here ? I told you to take care of the girl . We got split up . That snake of yours almost killed me . But he didn 't . Now you 're just another loose end . I had a feeling that 's what you would do . So I cut a new deal with someone who will pay twice what you pay . this is what I pay you for . Time to start cleaning house . Actually I 'm the new partner he was telling you about . Murdoch . A very good deal . Shoot him . Shoot him . Go ahead . What are you waiting for ? Shoot him . come on . go . move . Go . Are you okay ? come with me . They 're coming . Amanda . Murdoch . you would already be dead . this is a fully automatic weapon . Are you prepared to take the risk ? try me . Give me what I came for . There 's no time for this . The snakes are alive . Snakes ? Peter created a snake that would regenerate . Then the serum works . The threat has doubled . but not of immediate concern . Hey . I 'll give you a deal . Your lives for the serum . I am a man of my word . Yeah . Come on . Just give it to him . Give it to him . All right . Take your bloody serum . You saved my life . You can have yours . Now go . Go . get out . Go . hurry . It works ! It works ! I 'm not coming back . Made it . You can rot in hell . we gotta go . here . take the keys . You drive . Okay . what is that ? It 's the anaconda . hurry . go . go . get rid of this . Throw it out the window . down ! stay down . Down . take the wheel ! take the damn wheel ! Take it . come on . I got it . Jackson ! Keep your eyes on the road . Jackson . No . Hurry . Jackson . I 'm trying . Let 's see you try and regenerate from that . Let 's get out of here . Let 's go . Subtitles ßy MühàmmáÐ Ü § mâñ

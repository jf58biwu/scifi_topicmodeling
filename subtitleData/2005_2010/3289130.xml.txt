 [ Man Narrating ] Let me tell you about my day so far . Coffee in Paris , surfed the Maldives ... took a little nap on Mount Kilimanjaro . Oh , yeah , and I got digits from this Polish chick in Rio . And then I jumped back ... for the final quarter of the N.B.A. finals - courtside , of course . And all that was before lunch . I could go on , but all I 'm saying is ... I 'm standing on top of the world . The lighter terrain here - [ Man Narrating ] It wasn 't always like this . Once I was a normal person , a chump just like you . - Hey , Millie . - Oh , hey , David . You got a lot of cities there . Well , if you 're gonna have a dream , might as well dream big , right ? - Right . - [ Bell Ringing ] See you later . Hey , Millie . Give me a sec . Hey . I wanted to give you this . I picked it up at a yard sale in Plymouth . I-I thought you 'd really like it . It 's a little dinged up and it 's missing a few steps , but - I love it . - You do ? - I do . [ Boy ] Holy crap , Rice Bowl ! - Mark . - Hey , what 's this ? - Christmas come early ? - Mark , stop it . - Mark , give it back to her . - Holy crap ! Look what David got Millie ! You guys like the Eiffel Tower ? Wow , if you shake this thing hard enough , you can hear the Eiffel Tower move . - Hey , who wants to give it a shake ? - Okay , that 's enough ! - Stop it . Just give it back . - All right . Okay , I 'm sorry . Here . [ Students Laughing , Chattering ] Sorry , buddy . Guess I don 't know my own strength . - I can 't believe you 're such a jerk ! - I was just playing around . - It wasn 't funny . - [ Chuckles ] They thought it was pretty funny . [ Millie ] David ? David , don 't go out there . It 's not safe . David , just forget about it . Come on , Rice Bowl ! Don 't be stupid ! David , come back . Come on . Just let it go . It 's okay ! Stop ! It 's not worth it . Just come back . Please ? Come on , David ! [ Millie ] Be careful . Come on . - All good . See ? - [ Mark ] Great . Now come back . [ Millie Screams ] - David ! - Millie , don 't go out there ! [ Millie , Muffled ] David ! David ! Somebody [ Groaning , Muffled ] - [ Millie ] Oh , my God ! - David - Get help ! - Millie , get back here ! [ Millie ] Please help ! David ! - Call 911 I David ! - You can 't help him ! - Millie , stop , stop , stop ! - David ! [ Sirens Wailing ] [ Groaning ] [ Spitting , Coughing ] [ Coughing Continues ] [ David Narrating ] And that 's how it happened the first time . One second I 'm a goner , and the next thing I know I 'm at the Ann Arbor Public Library . Home , sweet home . Mom left when I was five . As for Dad , well , let 's just say he wasn 't much of one . You 're late . Supper 's cold . [ Men On TV , Indistinct ] Where you been , anyway ? [ Squishing , Squeaking ] You know , when I ask a question , I expect an answer . Okay ? Hey , hey , hey . What happened to you ? Just kids at school . Hey , David , get back down here , get a mop and clean this crap up ! David ! Don 't make me come up there ! David ? Make the right choice ! - [ Door Rattling ] - David ! David . Open the door . Did I just teleport ? Great . I teleported to the library . [ Men Conversing , Indistinct ] Look-No , no , no . I 'm not going anywhere . I don 't care what you say . [ David Narrating ] And that 's when it occurred to me . This thing that just happened , it could set me free . And if she could run away , so could I. You 're okay . [ Tap On Window ] [ Tap On Window ] [ Chain Squeaking ] [ Squeaking Continues ] [ Gasps ] [ David Narrating ] I wanted to tell her everything . David ? David ? [ David Narrating ] I mean , who would have believed me anyway ? [ Millie ] David ! [ David Narrating ] I figured it was time to move on . Uh , I 'd like a room . You 're not gonna be any trouble , are you ? No weird stuff ? Nope . No weird stuff . [ Dog Barking , Growling ] [ Chuckles ] [ David Narrating ] And so there I was . I had a million questions , like how does this thing work ? How do I control it ? [ Groans ] Been there . [ David ] Mommy , you can see the ocean and everything ! If we 're lucky , maybe we 'll see King Kong . - Really ? - [ Laughs ] - You got me ? - Oh , I got you . I 'm not letting you go . [ Rumbling ] [ David Narrating ] I was 15 . Come on . What would you have done ? I figured I 'd pay it back someday . Is there a bathroom for customers ? Hey . It 's this way . Yeah . Make it quick . No problem . Thanks . I 'm gonna need a bigger bag . # # [ Rock ] # Hey , I 'm not all alone # # Hey , you can tag along # # ' Cause I have done it before # # And I can do it some more # # I got my eye on the score # # I 'm gonna crash through the door It 's too late # # Holy shit .

[ Paper Slides ] The police and the F.B.I. have already been through here . - Who are you with ? - N.S.A. They couldn 't make heads or tails of it . The vault has a time lock , pressure mounts , steel plates . - This guy didn 't open a door . - Open a door ? We didn 't know we were robbed until halfway through the day . I want the security tapes for the whole month . And I need the name of everyone who has a safety deposit box in that vault . That 's confidential . Why do you need those names ? Whoever robbed your vault has been in it before . Now , I want those names , and I want those tapes . Today . [ David Narrating ] So the story had a happy ending . Rice Bowl was dead , but I had never been more alive . So now I 'm living in New York . [ Chuckles ] But why settle in one place ... when you can have the whole world ? # I was hip to the beat on city streets # # I saw a signpost tellin ' me to pick my feet off the ground , y 'all # # Said " I think " to the shrink # # I tell her well , ' bout my lover # # She tell me , " Get a dog that says bow-wow-wow " # [ Announcer ] She floats into the river .

Maia has the flu or something Hudson and want her to stay here . - Everything okay with her ? - I think so . I thought it was the bubonic plague but her doctor says it 's not bad . You need someone mowed down and escaped to a punishment ? This press strange . These are the benefits if your dad works at NTAC . How bad was the victim up to it ? I can say nothing about my lawyer . Who would I tell anyone ? Both his legs and collarbone are broken . Is that all ? He was in a car , Danny . He was not a pedestrian . You said you did .

I use them for the candidates , their psychological profile . Sorry . Okay , Isabelle . You can come with mommy . Goodbye . The movement is partly faith , part science . A powerful combination . 4400 phenomenon 100,000 members would agree but Burkhoff , neurologist at the University of Western Washington thinks differently . I do not. challenged their faith Because faith is a good thing . But what they do in the center is not science . How would fast meditation and sing you can change ? neurochemistry It is absurd . Good scam , but absurd . - " Scam " is a strong word . It is appropriate . a truth about the potential of the brain they squeeze people all their savings away . Your opinion surprised many . You have indeed been a paranoid personality had . Are you not heal by a device of 4400 ? Yes , I 'm grateful for that . But you have to make a difference between 4400 and 4400 center . 4400s have remarkable gifts .

Garritty , give me the gun . - This is too crazy , Baldwin . - Yes . How do we defend ourselves ? They want us to attack each other . If we remain armed , tonight we are dead . Otherwise we butchered . Everyone in the building is affected . The cafeteria staff now is perhaps an army . So I 'm going out who 's doing this and why . The lab does today controls . Thus , there are 4400 in the building . Do you think they are behind ? I do not know . But it is now my only idea . You ? Who says you have the bridge ? He did not. I . This building is ' t target of a stop by a 4400 . - This is a military situation . - Great , Baldwin . Put them get out they their weapons to resign . Major Culp , this signal ... Whatever it is , it has caused a lot of anger . Everyone in the building feel aggression . The men at least . We can not walk around with weapons . My team can psychological pressure . This is a gift of a 4400 . Who did not . Resist you There are 4400 's in the medical lab . É and of them did this . Baldwin would just go . Cartwright , keep an eye on them . - The rest come with me . - Wait a minute . What will you do ? Find out who this is responsible . And then ? Make sure that it stops . Careful . There 's a girl .

The signal is constant . It does not matter or you can do it hear . - Just a dog whistle . - This impulse will disappear . - We have to wait until it stops . Both-Shut up . I 'm trying to work . CALL D. SKOURIS It 's bad , Diana . Marco , what happens ? Depends on who you ask . Someone here caused something strange . Rumbling with our fight - and flight instincts . But especially the fighting instincts . Marco , I have to go inside , I need your help . Every man here now has liters adrenaline flows in his blood . And most of them are armed . You better stay outside . Listen , Marco . Maia is inside , I have to help her . Do you know where the plans of the building ? Yes . I find them . Then do it .

Lily , you say more Ruth as you like and also creche Isabelle and the likes . You had to be there . Ruth had a strange smile . Listen to yourself . Nobody performs tests its out there .

If it changes us . Everything is fine with us . The meditation , readers of synaptic potential our purification and seminars . You want half removal of our package . - We do not need them , Matthew . - Jordan thought so . But Jordan is not there anymore , right ? Besides , that Burkhoff is right . With chants gives you the 4400 the people are not up . That does not matter , the product sells well . Wait . " Product " ? It is not a pyramid scheme . People come here to change . - They seek answers . And that we will find . But if we change we seem weak . If people believe in what we do . I have to believe in it . Sick C Keep all stand . They all left . - Who are you ? - Roger Wolcott . I 'm here for my check . A-4400 ? - Why would I be here ? Make me go now . Thursday , July 28 - 16 : 22 pm That means no one .

It seems to go solidify . Do you want something for the pain ? No . You have the tranquilizers more necessary . How many injections did you ? - Three . And you 're still up ? Did not you be ? unconscious On a normal day I now sleep 12 hours . But today barely keeps me calm . Thank you have provided . Maia She is a sweet child . Listen , Diana . I only have three syringes . They worked faster . I want to hurt anyone . I want to kill anyone . - So if I 'm mad ... - I will take care of you . Do me a favor . - In my mind , right ? - You will not see it coming . Listen , Hudson . I gave you permission shoot me to death . Call me Max just yet . Well , Max . On that signal . Which of these bitches would emit ? I do not what that has to do . You wanted to hear my story . You 're in it now . Open your eyes . Imagine that three years has passed since you closed them . I can not . I could not . But they were gone . I missed it last year at school , that apparently would. cutest The rest my school was annoying . So who blacked out behind the wheel was a kind of aftereffect of the coma ? - Yes . - Wow . You 've been through so much . Are you jealous ? Which part sounds good ? The coma ? The hit and run ? I 'm jealous because you have so much experience acquired . It makes you interesting . But I did not do it . I was not . Great .

That reliable Marco does everything you want . I firmly believe in what we do . The 4400 is the model - For the next phase of the human being . - Go and backward . You 're too close . We can make their technology again . Not by singing three times . " Uncle " Indeed . But if you come to work with us we can achieve something . You know government has so often approached me . They have apparently a bizarre theory I 'm a new branch in science have discovered . I 've rejected . I do not like working with officials . It is normal they are curious . You were six years in a psychiatric institution . It is not nothin ' you 're back to work . I have not forgotten my fault . Besides , the government can not offer what I can . What then ? A bonus ? A fancy car ? I. I am the model boy , huh ? Healing hands . Unlimited access . Can you turn ? Mommy , I 'm scared . I know , honey . I 'm scared too . But it 'll be fine , because mommy is here . Okay ? Whatever comes through that door I will protect you . Tom . Tom , put the gun down . I agree . Diana . No , you 'll shoot if I throw it out . No , Tom . I want to hurt you . I want to hurt you , Diana . Tom , I said , quietly . My mom hoped I would meet a doctor but still a movement and I pull the trigger . What is that ? That 's Marco who deserves his wages .

Hey , Ruth . Look who 's back . - That was a long lunch . - I 'm sorry . I had lost track of time . There you are . We 'll get her in an hour . - We 'll be there . - Thank you . Day , Isabelle . Day . - Come . But I would still like View of houses . We can look around to see what is there . You 're in charge until I can go . Calling all men together that can still work and go back to work . I got it . Good . And let your head examined . How are you ? For such a slim woman you can hit hard . It was not just me . Culp had you been edited . This is the final score . Three policemen dead , two NSA agents a 4400 . Bruises , broken bones , stab wounds , fights . That 's a shock . It was a major attack and we were not prepared . Yes . How are you , darling ? Not so good . She gets glucose and erythromycin . She goes to St Michael 's to lower the fever . And the result ? I will consult a specialist . Should I worry ? No , Brett Kellerman is one of the best dermatologists . - He will know what it is . - You 're coming ? Of course . I go along with you in the ambulance . Good ? I 'm going as fast as possible to the hospital . Okay . - Oh , Max ? - Yes ? Thanks for everything . No , thank you for ... Not in my mind to shoot . And 4400s who protected Diana ? Who remain in jail to NTAC sure that they are innocent . That is an extra-long discussion . Yes . They will both stay up all night , I bet . Both ? Diana said that there were three . - Tom ? - She 's gone . A 4400 has almost a government building demolished and could easily escape . What do you call that ? Terrorism . Revenge is cruel . Welcome to the center . Would you like a tour ? No . Let Shawn Farrell know Kevin Burkhoff wants to see him . I 'm sorry , Mr. Farrell is busy . - Can I take a message ? - Yes . I want to start immediately . You can sleep when you want . Something eating some studying . Kyle ? Is everything all right ? I do not deserve you . That is so sweet . - I 'll be back . - Okay . Shawn This is Olivia Cohen . Sit here . That 's all right . Yes . She was 10 years ago blind by macular generation . The Foundation was moved by her story . Hello , Mrs. Cohen . - Hello . - Pleasant . We 're going to do the following it will feel strange but afterwards you can see again . I can hardly wait . - I 'm a little nervous . That 's not necessary . I take now your hands , right ? Good . Here we go . Here we go . When does it start ? When will I see you again ? Give me some time . Shawn . What is going on ? I do not know . Is it hot here ?

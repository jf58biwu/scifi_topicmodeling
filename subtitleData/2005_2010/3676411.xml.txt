 Destiny ... The design is clearly ancient , Launched hundred of thousands of years ago . Where the hell are we ? Several billion light years from home . We are on a ship , but we have no idea where we are In relation to earth . This ship could be the most important discovery Mankind has made since the stargate itself . These are the wrong people , In the wrong place . We 've got a lot of wounded . We need to get home . We barely have enough power To operate the main systems . This ship simply doesn 't have the capability to dial earth . Looks like we entered the hoth system . Minus 47 degrees celsius . Whoo , nasty planet . How are we going to cut the ice ? Plasma cutter , should cut through the ice like butter . It 's Dr. Rush. what 's your status ? We 've got pure ice . We should be able to break it up into manageable pieces And haul it back . Secure the perimeter . Welcome to the jungle . Okay , let 's get to work ! So ... Your first alien planet . Everything you expected ? More ? Less ? We saw what it was going to be like On the kino . True . But it is nice to get off the ship , Get some fresh air . Even if it is a bit sticky . So you 're not nervous at all ? Afraid some giant alien insect Is going to come out and bite you ? Sorry , I 'm sure it 's perfectly safe . Everyone has to pitch in and do their share . Including you , eli . What ? I need a break . So hot . All you 're doing is standing there . Making sure nothing crawls up your ass . And I appreciate that . Stop it ... So ... How 's it going ? Good . Digging ? Yup . You doing okay ? In general ? I 'm fine . Good . Good. that 's excellent . What 's so funny ? Oh , nothing . No , no , seriously . You 're laughing pretty hard . Come on , tell me . Why won 't you tell me ? It 's about me , isn 't it ? T.J ... How are we supposed to know What 's safe to eat ? We can 't know for sure . What 's that saying ? " a starving man ... " Well , maybe it wasn 't ripe . Try it . Uh , no. no , thanks . You just exposed yourself now . Come on , seriously ? Yeah . If you had a reaction , We wouldn 't know which one caused it . Uh , Volker just puked . Have you eaten anything here ? Eli ! Hmm ? Oh , sorry . Sorry . Are you staying hydrated ? Okay , what about any numbness , Or how 's your vision ? No , it 's- - My head 's pounding , And my neck 's a little ... Oh ! We should get him back to the ship . Eli , dial back . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ... Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! I don 't know , I just started feeling dizzy . It came on pretty fast . It feels like you 're running a temperature . I thought it was just the heat . Is your neck bothering you ? Yeah , it just started . Stiff at the back , mostly . Eli ... Right , I 'm on it . Okay , guys , listen up ! Get your stuff , we 're bugging out ! Hey , wait , wait . We can 't leave . If it 's something that they got here , It could be contagious . So , what are we supposed to do ? We have 36 hours before the destiny leaves . For the sake of everyone else on board , I say we ... We wait . Here ? For what ? At least for a little while . Just see how this plays out . It could be anything , really- - A virus , a bacteria . There 's no way to know if it 's airborne . You 've only been there three hours . I know . If it 's something they picked up locally , Then the progression is unfolding quickly . Sir , until we know more , I 'm recommending that we don 't return to the destiny With anything that might be contagious . Roger that . Let us know if anyone on board is exhibiting similar symptoms . At least that way we 'll know for sure If it has nothing to do with this planet . Will do . Check in every hour regardless . Copy that . Young out . Shut it off , greer . You must have some suspicions . I 've seen you giving them shots . I started them both On high doses of antibiotics . I hate to waste it , But given the symptoms of headache , fever , And neck pain , It 's better to be safe than sorry . Okay , so what is it , bacterial meningitis ? I don 't know , But if it turns out that 's what it is , And I haven 't done anything , They could die quickly . You don 't know . You 're using up our antibiotics On a hunch ? Yes , that was my judgment call That 's great . I thought you said it wasn 't far . It 's not . You doing okay ? Yeah , fine . Over here . Whoa ! what is that smell ? It 's sulphur . I 'd hate to see the ants who made those . Hey , hey , hello ! what are you doing ? Haven 't you seen alien ? You think this is what 's making people sick ? I don 't know . They make chemical weapons from this stuff . Yeah , I know , But we don 't know the exact compound Or concentration . Ooh . Well , there 's more over here . No , no , it 's all right , I believe you . Look , I 'm just saying , I know she doesn 't want to make Anybody else on the ship sick , But what if staying here Is going to kill us ? Well , this couldn 't get much worse . I 'm afraid that 's a failure of imagination . Top five desert island movies . What ? It 'll help pass the time . Okay , I 'll go first . Hackers . Obvious , I know . The matrix . Old school . You got to have something To make you laugh , right ? If trilogies count as one , Then all three original star wars , But if-if only one , then-then empire . Uh ... that 's four . Man , this is hard . I could pick so many . Maybe it should be top 10- - T.J. ! Yeah ? Good will hunting has got to be there- - James is not doing well . Where is she ? How many does that make now ? Uh , that 's Chloe , Volker , Marsden and Franklin . Now James , too . Wait a minute , let me look at your eyes . No , I 'm fine . No , you 're not . You need a shot too . Dial out ! Dial the gate ! Destiny , come in . If you can hear me , please respond ! What 's wrong ? I don 't know ! Why is it doing that ? We 've got to get out of here ! We can 't ! Why is it doing that ? Okay ... What the- - Hey , did you guys hear ? Yeah , there was a kino already there ? How is that possible ? We dropped out of FTL , the gate dialed , And we sent a kino to check out the planet . They go through , And there 's another one already there Lying on the ground not far from the gate . Hey , guys ? We only sent one kino , right ? Turns out the databank was full . Looks like the databank is full . Well , what 's on it ? Us . What do you mean , " us " ? They 're watching the recording now , But I heard that a bunch of us are on it . Doing what ? Going through the gate to the planet To gather food . Then apparently some people started getting sick . I think that I was one of them . But that didn 't happened . Obviously . You 're fine , right ? Apparently , They found human remains , too . It 's weird . You okay ? Yeah , it just hit me . You 're sure you 're okay otherwise ? Yeah . Pretty understandable . Not to me . I was talking about the barfing . I was moving on . How is this possible ? I don 't know . Ooh , What about an alternate reality ? Sir , given the illness that developed on the planet , I suggest that we quarantine everyone who went through To retrieve this kino . Scott , greer , Eli and Rush . And everyone they came in contact with since returning . Well , that 's all of us . Here. i 'll have to coordinate on radio . Brody was also in the gate room when they got back . We were only there For , like , a half hour at most . That 's more than enough time To come in contact with a contagion . Wait a second . You 're worried because people got sick on this recording , Which never happened . Well , we don 't know that . What are you saying ? Well , that is clearly us . The recording happened somehow . What do you think was wrong with the gate ? It looks like the wormhole connection was unstable . It would have been extremely dangerous To even attempt travel . Sir ? Go . So ... Keep watching ? Can you fast forward , please ? Yeah . Chloe 's dead . James , spencer , Marsden , Brody . All dead . Something 's wrong with the gate . Rush doesn 't think we can risk using it , Even with what 's happened . We can 't reach destiny on radio , either , So apparently we 're trapped here . There 's 22 hours until destiny jumps back into FTL . The creatures seem to be nocturnal . They stopped coming once the sun came up . Hopefully the gate will start working Before it gets dark again . Apparently ... We don 't have much ammunition left . Eli , what are you doing ? Volker wasn 't killed by the creatures . T.J. says he died of the illness during the night . Everyone seems to be coming down with symptoms at this point- - Eli ! Do I need to point out yet again That documenting this could be important ? See ? See ? Who do you think is ever going to see that ? Us. us ! we are ! You look ridiculous . It won 't fly . If someone hadn 't shot it ... Scott was bitten by one of the creatures . He 's now in a coma . Eli , you okay ? Compared to most everyone else . Don 't go too far . We are under quarantine . Eli ! Sergeant greer has found a cave nearby . It could be our best chance To survive another night , If it comes down to that . We could use some help ! Good man . My turn . Oh , sorry . So at least it 's a defensible position . Backs to the wall . Better than being exposed on all sides . I have a lot of respect For people who do what you do . It 's not easy . I can tell it really affects you When you can 't help people . It does . My mom was a nurse . She got stuck by a needle Trying to restrain a junkie in the e.R. She got hiv . I 'm sorry . My father couldn 't handle it . He just ... He just left . I was 14 at the time . That must have been hard on you . Do you have a family ? My parents . My dad 's retired . What did he do ? He was a tailor . He 's actually the one Who taught me how to do stitches . I remember this one time He cut himself pretty badly with some scissors , and ... He sewed it up himself And kept right on working . Brothers or sisters ? A sister . She has two kids . I miss them . I 'm really afraid That my mom 's just going to give up If I die out here . I remember as a kid , I was , I don 't know , maybe seven or eight , My grandfather died , And my parents took me to the funeral . Watching his casket Getting lowered into the ground , It-it was the first time that I realized I was going to die one day . I - I mean , I knew people died . I 'm-I 'm talking about the idea That my consciousness was going to end . I - I wasn 't going to see What happened to the world . It was such an empty , Dark feeling , Like I was falling down a pitch-black hole . It was ... Scared the crap out of me . I take it you don 't believe in the afterlife . That fear Was almost too much to handle . I guess maybe I thought I 'd just get used to it . But you don 't . No . No , it scared me just as much Every time . Most people realize their own mortality At some stage of the game , eli . It 's not a particularly unique experience . I know . The question is , Did it change you ? Did it inspire you to make something Of this short existence that we have ? Well , I 'm here , aren 't I ? Of course , the ancients evolved to a point Where their physical bodies were no longer necessary , Found a way for consciousness to become immortal . You really think that 's possible ? I know it is . Maybe not for you and me , But that idea ... It 's the reason why I ended up here . So you think if we learn enough , That somehow , Somewhere out there We-we could discover how it 's done ? We have to make it through the day . Hey ... You , uh , you okay ? It didn 't happen . Well , it 's ... It 's not clear what happened . I know I didn 't go to that planet And have all those people die under my watch . It wasn 't your fault , sergeant . It didn 't look like there was anything You could have done differently . I am not interested in what did not happen . Sir . Regardless of how that recording came into existence , Avoiding the issue is simple . We just don 't go back to that planet . Doesn 't bother you ? Like you said , it didn 't happen . Just a story , right ? I am curious to find out how it turns out , though . Not me . Whoa ! What just happened ? Uh , she started complaining That her head hurt . She just dropped . It 's been three hours Since we dropped out of FTL . That 's about the time people began to get sick On the planet in the recording . T.J. ! Yeah , over here . Right here . You said she just passed out ? I 've got four more cases . So far everyone who went to the planet , Or came in contact with someone who did . Can it be contained ? I don 't know , But whatever it is , it 's extremely virulent . On the , uh , kino recording , Eli said Volker died because of it . How quickly ? Within 12 hours . M4 carbine . Hold the grip firmly , Stock braced against your shoulder . It 's got a kick . Keep your finger off the trigger Until you 're ready to kill Whatever it is you 're pointing at . Short bursts . We don 't got much ammo . Go ahead . You mean shoot for real ? That way . Okay ... Safety 's off . Whoa ! oh , man ! What happened to short bursts ? You sure they 're down there ? Saw ' em go home last night . You really think this is a good idea ? The best defense Is offense . Fire in the hole . Yeah , literally . I hope we didn 't just piss them off . Oh ... Okay ... Oh , wow ... Ugh ! ' kay , that 's disgusting . Come on , we got more of these things to hit . Uh-huh . His pulse is very weak . Did using the other remote help ? We were able to get a connection , But the wormhole is still unstable . Nothing from destiny on the radio . Well , is it broken , Or is there a chance it could resolve By itself ? There are a number of things That could be causing temporary interference . Well , we have 11 hours Until destiny is supposed to jump Back into FTL . There 's no way of telling how long it 's going to last . And I guess it would be crazy To try and go anyway . Look , we can 't assume That the gate is actually even connecting to destiny . There 'd be very little chance Of surviving an unstable wormhole . A fire would be nice . I couldn 't find any dry wood . Huh . Are they still watching the recording ? Yeah . I don 't know what to do . They just keep showing up , And I don 't have nearly enough antibiotics For all these people . It would help if I knew the cause . You 're not feeling good ? No . Just go slow ... See anything ? No . Good . Maybe we got them all today . Did you see that ? Did you see something ? I think I saw something ! If you see anything move out there , Don 't ask , just shoot . Right . Right , okay . Hey ... Hey , I think the batteries in this one are dead . The kino has night vision . Why didn 't I turn it on ? Oh , never mind . Oh , my g- - Come on , come on ! I don 't think we 're going to make it . I 'm out ! Come on , come on , come on ... Gimme ! Hey , hey ! Where are you going ? He 's crazy . You 're crazy ! You are . Come back ! Wait ! Son of a ... Wait ! Stop ! Someone 's got to try . Look , I 'll radio if I make it . You 'll know it 's safe . If ? B - but you said ... Hey ... For a moment there , I thought we were in trouble . What ? ! " for a moment there , I thought we were in trouble ? " Butch cassidy and the sundance kid . It 's ... Butch 's last line before he and sundance Run out to face the bolivians . One of my favorites , too . Well , well , We do have something in common after all . Eli ... Destiny ? Come in ! Colonel young , Dr. Rush ... What is it ? Some sort of microorganism . Something brought back from the planet ? Not the planet they just went to , The planet you and Scott went to , the ice planet . That was weeks ago. how do you know ? This is a sample Of the water we 've been drinking , isn 't it ? When people outside the quarantine Started coming down with symptoms , I knew we needed to look for Another common source . But we tested it at the time . At the time , we couldn 't see it . The microscope just wasn 't powerful enough , And the organism was just too small . Well , it isn 't now . It 's possible that a batch of water Wasn 't purified properly , And it contaminated the rest . So we 've all got it ? Well , everyone 's immune system is different . The time it takes for symptoms to emerge will vary , But once it 's strong enough To pass from the blood to the nervous system , It works fast , And the antibiotics won 't cut it . Well , for a moment there , I thought we were in trouble . Eli ... Eli ? Eli ... Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ... Oh , God ... It 's 45 minutes ... Until destiny jumps back into FTL . Everyone here is dead Except me . I don 't remember much After we were attacked the first night . One of the creatures bit me , And I lost consciousness . I was starting to feel sick , Headache , pain in the back of the neck . The bite still hurts like a bitch , But everything else is ... Is better . The gate still doesn 't seem to be working . I - I can 't reach destiny on the radio . I 'm hoping it 's just a communications problem , And that everything else is ... Is okay up there . I 'm sending this through , And I 'm expecting that you will send some sort of a signal That it is safe to proceed . I will wait as long as I can , And then I 'll head through regardless . On my own , I likely won 't survive the night here . What just happened ? It went back in time . What are you doing ? Making sure it hasn 't happened yet . What hasn 't happened yet ? A solar flare . It 's the only explanation . If a wormhole 's trajectory takes it too close to a star , And it passes through an active solar flare , It can cause it to move forwards or backwards in time . In some cases , The wormhole can actually loop back around And connect to the same gate in a different time , In this case , the past . Whoa , whoa ... Okay , this is making my brain hurt . Uh ... Oh , my God . Back to the future . How could I not put that on my list ? The " us " on that recording Dropped out of FTL and went to the planet . Some time later , a solar flare occurred , Preventing normal gate travel . So scott thought That he was sending the kino back to the destiny , But he was actually sending it back to the planet , But in the past . God , that is so weird to think That was really us on the kino . Us in a previous unaltered timeline , Modified now by the introduction of the kino from the future . Why are we dialing the gate back there ? As I said , To make sure the solar flare that disrupted gate travel Hasn 't happened yet . Thankfully , it hasn 't . Yeah , but why do we care about that ? Because I think we might have to go back there . I was starting to-to feel sick , Headache , Pain in the back of the neck . The bite still hurts like a bitch , But everything else is - Is better- - It 's possible , I guess . The venoms of various animals , Snakes , spiders , scorpions , They 've all been tested for their antibiotic properties . Are you saying that thing that bit me Can actually cure what 's making everybody sick ? You fell into a coma . It obviously releases some sort of venom When it bites . You apparently survived , said you were feeling better . But ... You were just guessing , And those things were ... Well ... Based on this video , People are going to die from this infection , And quickly . I know it seems like a wild stab in the dark , But I don 't know what else to do . We 've all been exposed , So it 's just a matter of time before we all get it , right ? I 'll go , sir . Not by yourself , you won 't . We don 't need liabilities , scott . Well , I 'm good to go , sir . Getting kino visuals . It 's night time , And oh , hey , surprise , surprise , It 's raining . Which means those things will probably be out . That 's too bad . They were easy pickings When they were sleeping in their nests during the day . Well , we can 't wait . According to the time stamp On the recording , You have an hour Until the first team lost contact Because of the solar flare . 45 minutes , to be safe . How many do you think we 'll need ? Hopefully a small dosage of the venom will do it . Dead or alive ? Alive , preferably . I can 't exactly anticipate the physiology . Not much time . Good luck ! What ? Her pulse is very weak . I just want you to be prepared . I 'm not sure She 's going to make it . Of course she is . We 're out of antibiotics . Why do people always wait Until times like these To tell someone how they really feel ? It 's so stupid . I - I just ... Ah , screw it . We haven 't known each other that long , But I think ... We make each other happy . When I 'm near you , things are just ... Better . You don 't even know how amazing you are . It doesn 't matter . I 've never had a best friend before . Never . Never known anyone like that before , Never loved ... Um ... I just ... I need to make sure that you know That I 'm here for you ... Always will be . Please don 't die . Eli ... She 's gone . I don 't see anything ! They got to be here somewhere . Colonel young , this is Rush . Come in . I read you. go ahead . Checking in . Nothing yet . It 's raining pretty hard . I 'm sorry to have to tell you , But we 've already lost four people . Doctors Franklin And Volker , Lieutenant James ... And Chloe . Copy that . Check in again in 10 minutes . Lieutenant ... Lieutenant , we need you . Scott ! Scott ! We need you . Colonel young , come in , please . Colonel young , do you read ? If you 've found this , It 's because a solar flare interfered with gate travel , And I managed to send this kino Back in time . All right , listen very carefully . There is a disease In the water we brought back from the ice planet . It is fatal , And we have all been drinking it , But there is hope . There 's a ... A creature that - that lives on this planet , Lots of them , actually , That could hold the key to saving you . In small doses , Their venom actually cures the disease , But be very careful . They 're deadly . They 're also nocturnal . They only come out at night . You can get them during the day While they 're asleep in their nests , And they 're not far from the gate . Come on ! Please believe me . You don 't have much time . Act now , Or you are all going to die .

How we gonna do this ? Swiftly . We grab claire , we take out her father . We get out . When you say " take out , " you mean kill ? It is a euphemism . Word choice aside , I never agreed to take out anybody . You were loyal to bennet . I get that . The two of you were going to take down the company . But you made the right choice in telling me the truth . I 'm not choosing sides . This is about claire 's blood curing niki . I 'm just trying to do the right thing For everyone . That 's what i like about you , Dr. Suresh . Your moral compass always faces True north . Which is why you 're going to get a new partner . One who can execute . One whose compass faces north-Northwest . I hope you 're using sunscreen . Ugh . Overprotective , much ? Dr. Suresh , I would like you to meet my daughter , elle . Your daughter ? She 's the executioner ? What 's your super power ... punching bag ? Have you been working on your sharp shooting ? I don 't want you to get too close to bennet .

I 'm not pretending . And i 'm not a spy , i swear . I 'm just ... I 'm just a cheerleader . So this is all a big coincidence ? That your dad just happens to be the guy Who abducted me ? Then why didn 't you just tell me ? I was selfish . You liked me . You were like me . And i thought ... That if i told you ... It would just mess everything up . And i guess it did . My family 's leaving town . When ? Tonight . But i 'm not going with them . I 'm staying here because of you . I wanna believe you . But i don 't . I need to go figure things out . Yes , i 've been on hold waiting for a special agent - No , some of that interdepartmental cooperation I 've been hearing so much about on the news . Yes , i 'll hold . What are you doing ? I was on hold with the fbi . Well , i want you to tell me Why you 're on hold with the fbi . Because i 'm trying to get some information On the kaito nakamura case . The kaito nakamura case is closed . Angela petrelli confessed , partner . Yeah , but she didn 't do it . There 's something bigger going on here . I don 't know what it is , but these guys are involved In some kind of , uh , organization , Like from back in the ' 70s . Like a disco ? No ... no . Like a research facility . I was there yesterday . All these guys-Nakamura , linderman , arthur petrelli , My dad , and this adam monroe guy . Your dad ? Yeah . Let it go . You got real work to do . This is real work !

Excuse me , detective ? give me 24 hours . Let me talk to angela petrelli again . Tell you what . You got 24 hours . Talk to angela petrelli again . Then you 're done . Thank you . Great idea . Is this him ? he looks a lot younger there . Well , apparently , he can fly . Did you really do what claire said ? Abduct him when he was just a boy ? I thought we were doing good . Saving the world . Honestly , i don 't know why I 'm not getting in the car with the kids and leaving you . Come here . I want to show you something . Remember that painting i showed you ? The death of kaito nakamura . Kind of hard to forget a story About a man who can paint the future . Well , that was one of eight . I found the other seven yesterday . That 's claire , isn 't it ? Is that ... claire 's right . It 's all about me . And this man with the gun , Is he gonna shoot you ? Believe me , i 've considered it . But suresh is one of the good guys . And you think west has something to do with it ? I don 't know , but west is the reason Why claire won 't leave town . And i need to talk to him . It 's all falling apart . I really need you now . I 'm gonna ... take lyle to school . Hello . Is molly well enough to use her ability ? why ? I need to track down a boy , And i don 't have time to run all over costa verde . His name is west rosen . Are you okay ? You sound - Can you do it or not ? Yes , of course . Mohinder ... yeah ? Just ... Thank you . That was bennet . Does he know we 're here ? No . He just wanted some information . A location of a boy . Maybe we can use this to our advantage . How so ? We feed him a false location . We isolate him . We get him away from claire . We don 't have to kill him . Do you know what happens When you change your plans mid-Stream ? No . Neither do i . Because we don 't do it . Let me put it this way . We do it my way , or i blow the whistle right now . Tell bennet everything . Bennet is dangerous . You saw what he did To his mentor in the ukraine . Don 't you think if push came to shove , He 's do the same to you ? No . I don 't . He 's adorable . Can i keep him ? Okay ... we do it the doctor 's way . i sought redemption By helping hiro fulfill his destiny To save the world . How did you help your son ? I 'm leaving for japan tonight . I suggest you disappear as well . Where are you going ? I can 't just wait around . He goes to school with Claire . Remember me ? Then you know i don 't have super strength . I can 't hold on forever . What do you want ? Answers ! We took you to study your abilities ! I don 't care about any of that ! Claire ! Is she working with you ? Or for you ? Did she ever really care about me ? Claire never even mentioned you existed ! You hear me ? She lied to me ! So i 'm guessing you 're pretty important to her . Aah ! Agh ! You listen to me very carefully . I am taking claire . We are leaving town . And you are gonna convince her that 's the right thing to do . Hello . I just spoke to molly . She 's located west . He 's in Costa Verde . Corner of Verbena and Palm . Right now ? Are you sure ? Molly 's ability has pinpoint accuracy . But i can 't guarantee that he 'll be there forever . You should get there quickly . Okay . I 'll head right over . What 's going on ? Claire 's in danger . I need your help . Claire butler , Bring it on in ! Hey , we missed you this morning . Is everything okay ? Yeah , everything 's great . Good . Come here . This is Mr. Bishop from the state board of education . He needs to talk to you about the debbie incident .

She can save lives . " The work we 're doing . " You sound like me ten years ago . This is what they do : they indoctrinate you . I couldn 't have been more clear about this When you agreed to go in . They 're not who you think they are . They are not getting claire . I have to do what i think is right . Start driving . Please . Dad ! Mom ? ! Lyle ! Aah ! Claire ? Mom ! This guy showed up at my school . He knew our real name . What ? Dad was right . I messed up , and they found us . We gotta go . Go where ? What is this ? That 's why your father 's Been acting so strangely - He thinks that 's gonna happen . Isaac mendez ... He was a very talented artist , And incredibly accurate .

I need to speak to your father . What do you think - This is my first day ? Aah ! Stings like a bitch , doesn 't it ? I know all about your ability , elle . You don 't know anything about me . I was there . When your father first brought you in . You were a normal girl . Unicorns and rainbows . And then they started the testing . The human brain isn 't built to take that much electricity . You poor girl . My father would never let that happen . Your father was leading the charge . I don 't remember any of that . No memories , huh ? Kind of like someone took them away ? Why do you think I never let the company anywhere near claire ? I didn 't want her To become you . Now i need to talk to your father To arrange a trade . Claire for you . What if he doesn 't wanna make a deal ? You 'd be surprised what a father would do for his daughter . Elle , where are you ? you touch my daughter and i 'll kill yours . And then i 'll kill you . noah ? We 'll be at the imperial beach parking lot In two hours . Well , looks like you and i Are going to the beach . I 'll do whatever you want , okay ? Just promise me you 'll leave my dad alone . I wish it were that easy . Unfortunately , he 's got my daughter . Let me talk to him . He 'll listen to me . He 's not big on the listening . And once he sets his mind , it 's stuck . Which is why we gave you to him in the first place . We thought he would be loyal to the end . Turns out we were right . It 's too bad , really . You 'd be an excellent addition to the team , claire . You , your blood . You can help a lot of people . Good . Take my blood . Take as much as you want , but leave my dad alone . No one has to die . Thanks for your help , west . Now go on home to your family . No way ! I 'm going with you . No , it 's too dangerous . Exactly , and i 'm the quickest way To get claire out of there . All right . You can wait for me in the car , okay ? they say girls tend to find boys Just like their dads . Because he can fly ? No , her real dad . You . All he cares about is protecting her . If anything happens ... Nothin ' is gonna happen , Except you bringing Claire back . Of all of them ... I never expected it would be you . Hey ! Kaito ! Kaito ! Kaito ! Ando ... If you visit me one more time , detective parkman , I 'll expect you to make an honest woman out of me . That is the plan actually . are you going to try to read my mind again ? I knew your father when he could do it . I 'm even less impressed with you . Those marks that you have all over you , My father made you do that to yourself , didn 't he ? Did you know him When his mind reading became something more ? When pull became push , and then he realized He could put a thought into anyone 's head ? Don 't do this . you are gonna answer Every question i have truthfully . For once . Who really killed kaito nakamura ? It was adam . Adam ? Monroe ? Your son told me that you and your friends Locked him up 30 years ago . Why ? He was dangerous . Dangerous how ? Like a bomb ? No , worse . We thought he was just able to heal . Cellular regeneration . Like claire , your granddaughter . What we didn 't know is that if your cells Continually regenerate , After a while , you stop growing old . What 's old ? 400 years . Do you know where adam is now ? All i know is that he wants revenge For locking him up , and he 's not gonna rest Until all of us are dead . All of you are , except for you , bob , My dad , and this woman in the photo . Who is this woman ? Please ... don 't do this . I need you to tell me the truth . The truth ... The truth ... is that our generation Mortgaged our souls to protect yours . Show a little respect for that . Get over your daddy issues and leave us be ! That 's all i want . Believe me . But adam is still out there , and this woman is on his list . tell me the truth . Who is she ? All she wants is to be left alone . I made her a promise . If you take this secret from me , You 're not just like your father ... You are him . What kind of car do you drive ? Excuse me ? I know you can fly , but you 're still a teenager . You do have a car , right ? Yeah , it 's a piece of crap suv . I drove a ' 52 citroen when i was your age . Oh , those things are awesome . Now once we get Claire , You fly her out immediately . No matter what else happens . You understand me ? Yes , sir . It doesn 't have to be this way , noah . Dad , the painting ! Aah ! Claire ! Elle ! No matter what i do ... We 'll always be running . But if you die , bob ... The company dies with you . please , don 't do this . The last thing i really said to my dad ... Was " i hate you . " You didn 't mean it . No , i did . I keep playing it over and over . How i 'll never get a chance to take it back . Holy - To be continued ...

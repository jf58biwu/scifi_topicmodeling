You see me perhaps for the first time but I know you very well . You 're smart , your writer Alan Moore and your favorite food is meatloaf . But I 'm not the same . You said there was no 4400 , so that means no coma , no lost time . And no problems . That 's right . You were happy . Successful . What do you mean ? You wanted to to study medicine ? - There you went to Stanford . - How did I do it there ? You graduated with honors . You were neurologist . You must have been proud . I 'm always proud of you . Okay , but Dr. Kyle Baldwin in that world where you tarried that came out of your head , right ? Actually came out of my head . With his memories . Kyle , I 'm just so proud on which you perform here . Even prouder . Hi . Want to know why lawyers are jerks ? Because they have their whole life read this kind of junk . What kind of shit right ? I can explain it . I have 24 hours to Maia 's diary to give NTAC and no chance to make legally evade them . - What are you doing ? - What NTAC want , get it . My daughter of 9 home counting on my protection . - Can I do anything ? - Me ' n my ears turn to give because I mentioned that diary . It saved Collier 's life , not and now thrives fresh the mine .

JEAN BAKER DeLynn Disappeared : October 27 , 1999 Day , Mr. Ross . Had a good flight ? Yes , thank you . I will guide you or would you prefer to rest ? - Bring me to Mr. Farrell . - This way . - They have been waiting three days . - Tell the pr that I do not know . According to them , the deadline passed . This press release has to go . Should this come from me ? I do not understand half once . - It does not sound like me . - Change it . You 're the boss . Sign for juridici , and no one is paid . Also , the non-juridici . - I can be only one thing at a time . Then we start with ' t press release . Why not dictate what ? No press release . If the press wants to know what Mr. Farrell thinks then they look at 60 Minutes , like the rest of America . I booked 'S exclusive interview with the new face of 4400 . That 's it for now . Thank you . I 'm sorry to barge . I thought I could help . - I am Matthew Ross . - Yes . - What are you doing in Seattle ? - I go where I 'm needed . - Then you are at the right place . That 's no coincidence , Shawn . Jordan said that if he died I had to come forward to help you . One of the many plans where Jordan told me about . Good to see you . Jordan had a lot about you . You will receive a new lobbyist to hire . I remain provisionally at headquarters . Choose your own office . You can start right away . These letters . Everyone knows that I can heal . Jordan wanted to healing gift publish but he wanted to do it in steps . We no longer have that luxury . But we 'll be fine . I can not go outside . There are sick , press , they follow me everywhere . That remains the rest of your life so . The ground has shifted beneath you . You rediscover your balance , or you goes down . This center is the new Lourdes . No one will give us more call a sect . We send more people away then we can enroll . In 10 years , this movement the greatest faith on the planet . Stop . I 'm glad everything is going so well . Last week I just wanted Get it last level of Doom . When I was the pope , and now no . Who you are . Get used to it firmly . The FBI is leading the hunt by Jordan Colliers murderer . We are still involved , NTAC and makes the arrest . I do not let anyone else our mess . Then we need to work . There 's a time limit in this type of raids . The trail goes cold after 48 hours . Give me the arriveerlijsten of Oak office and every garage within 10 blocks from downtown . Everyone in those books has been questioned . Then we have Find out the books . He has in broad daylight Slain a public figure . There must be an eyewitness . Until now , Tom , you 're the only who has seen the killer . Lost . Thick lost . Honey , what you do , never go gambling . It is wrong and stupid . Why do you do it ? Not like me , Aunt May has no steady income . She is an artist , and always need money . What is so stupid , because I always lose . So that look into the future that applies not only to world-class things , right ? Not always . - So if I asked Weik fate ... - That one . I 'll take this . Thank you . WINNER Girl , you are my new lucky charm . - I 'll get you the Collier case . - What do you mean ? We have half the neighborhood still questioning . That will have to wait . At 10.37 sent the FEMA a disaster team to Granite Pass in Oregon , 273 inhabitants for a outbreak of a deadly , highly infectious and unknown virus . By-distributed air ? - Fixed . - Artificial ? - Unknown . But if you tonight slept in Granite Pass you lie now likely in a body bag . FEMA has only one resident can not find . DeLynn Jean Baker , 30 years . Return Ling 0188 . Disappeared in ' 99 . Divorced , no children . Profile says a loner . She has struggled since she 's back . Could not keep a job ... Four times unemployed in 1 year . And now the only resident Granite Pass which was not found . - There are two possibilities . - Whether she is immune ... so we can study its find a cure . Whether she is a carrier . Anyway , the task is the same . Use what is needed to find her . Are you going to tell me where you 're going ? I never been able to weeping women . That is why I never married . Having problems ? Leave your family ? The police are after you ? I 'm going to Seattle . That is a big city . Should I drop you off at the edge ? I go to the 4400 center . There I go . Why then ? Will you join us ? Bring me so near if you can , please . If you are looking for salvation , you will not find it there . You can surrender yourself better to your true Lord and Savior . The day of treatment approaches . The signs are everywhere . Epidemics , plagues . Tell me about it . I woke up this morning in a city full of dead people . My mother , my father , everyone . Why did you survive ? I think I am the cause . You ? You take me for a ride . Go ahead . Laugh to the Jesus Freak . But I tell you , the world is easily wiped clean . I think you 're not a freak . I even believe everything you say . The eyes and fingernails but slightly discolored . Rigor mortis has just occurred . It turns out the autopsies ? Nothing we may appoint . Their internal organs are almost liquid . It works fast . You put your helmet . You want to die ? The virus is released , spreads and evaporates in a half hour . Seen-Enough ? - Spacious enough . So everyone died here this morning because they ' t reach inside were of the virus . Did you drive an hour later along , you had nothing . But Orson Bailey , Trent Appelbaum . If a 4400 has a gift , which is rapidly gaining strength . So when Jean DeLynn Baker the virus spreads ... Is she might pass it to warm up . The doctors say my cancer is incurable . - Aggressive chemo ... - always worked ... . Tuberculosis has our savings eaten ... married for 40 years ... - Grandma said to pray ... me so when I saw you on TV , I knew ... Help me . - Heal onsl go . Shawn , it 's Lucy . Time for your speech . Everyone is waiting for you . Shawn ? FAITH and SUCCEED I 'm flattered . But I do not know whether I can take a job . Richard will now travel a lot . The child here is quite good and free . But I do not know if I 'm qualified . I mean , Assistant Director staff . I got my first child right after my studies . My whole resume fit on half a page . You are a 4400 . This is usually a very high degree . - In addition , Jordan has called you . - Oh , I guess . He said you have empathy , A born organizer are and that you are the best in people up can bring . Jordan said that about me ? You are a return rail . You 're smart . We encourage people like you here . Wipe your feet . A Deadly virus is spread and you complain about footprints . It is someone 's home . So here lived DeLynn Jean Baker . Until they took off . Did she have a blog ? A weekly planner or something ? Yes , but that 's probably put upside when she realized that her city was leeggevaagd . Has anyone contacted with her parents ? This is their home . They were sleeping when the virus struck . You do not go away before everything is searched . Letters , bills , lists . Marco , listen . Find a pattern . How they think . She 's on the run . I want to catch her . - Flirt . - You heard what he said . 4400 center . What can I do ? I did not mean . I did not want to kill them , I ... - Those blisters , they itch so . - Who kill ? - You have to help me . - Who is this ? I am a 4400 and there is something wrong with me . Everyone in my neighborhood dies , and I just can not stop . I can not stop . Tell me your name and where you are . How many dead are there ? She said hundreds , but it is not on the news . Maybe they want it stop . And Jean Baker is one of the 4400 ? She is in a motel near Squirrel Hill exit on 65 . Call at NTAC . You were right . Philadelphia has preserved them . How much did you win ? - $ 200 for aunt April . All thanks to you , my little genius . Now Chicago at New York , on paper a similar struggle . Chicago plays at home , so that is an advantage but New York has won his last three races . So who do you choose ? How do you put in ? All 200 dollars . That 's not enough for a pension , but you have to start somewhere . So , do you feel anything ? Do you like me ? What do you mean it do with this ? I mean , for who I am or because I know what will happen ? Honey , listen . I love you for who you are , not for what you can . Forever . Okay ? I would choose Chicago . Then it Chicago . Okay , come on . Aunt May takes you for pizza . Go wash and do your mother 's clothes . You know she does hard on ... Maia . This is my mother 's engagement ring . How did you get here ? I always play with it . This is a very valuable ring meaning it is not a toy . Go wash well , otherwise I order anchovies . - Hi . - Hi . Do not take it the wrong way , but how did you get in ? Your father gave me a key . A little early for supper . For food , perhaps , not for cooking . Can you cook ? I 'm a famous brain surgeon , no chef . But I can just as well as they unpacking groceries . I warn you , you forget Dad 's main line . And that is ? The longer and better 're preparing a family party ... The greater the chance he 's not coming . So you know him really . What does that you know me so which is weird , sorry . For me it is quite strange . We have for 8 year relationship which I still have to think that does not exist . Say , I was the best in the class with medications ? What does it matter , Kyle ? - It 's not a competition with yourself . - I am curious . You 're always on . That 's more than curiosity . And so what ? If you knew of a parallel universe with a smarter version yourself what did you think of it ? He was no better or smarter . He was you . He had options I will never have . No 4400 . No coma . He could study medicine . - Who says you can not ? - I am 21 and only freshman . You 're a little late getting started . You think I know two Kyles . But I only know you . Do you want to be a doctor ? I 'm sure you the entrance examination can get . Jean Baker is in a motel 15 km away . Half NTAC is on his way there . Mortimer and Falcone firmly . Crazy , huh ? Responding to a tip from the 4400 center . Shawn said he with us wanted to work . He meant it . Excuse me . We 're from NTAC . We have lined . - I let you cycle . - What is going on here ? Dead truck . It looks to have . Quickly struck Jean-DeLynn Baker ? - What are you doing ? - I called for help . - We know that . Come on . No , you 're scaring me . Please stop . It itches when I 'm scared . Please , let me go . Oh , God . That driver is dead. less than 3 hours Jean has not previously been picked up than two hours before . It is exposed , infected and slain within 120 minutes . Such rapid virus I 've never seen . Mortimer and Falcone there before . - Baldwin . - It 's not my fault . - Who is this ? - I called for help . - You threw tear gas . Jean Baker . How do you get Mortimers phone ? What do you think ? They made me afraid . She stormed into my room . What did you do with them ? You thought they were safe deal with that ? Well , you were wrong . No one is safe . Therefore I warn you . Stay away from me , okay ? Keep everyone away from me . - Where are you ? - At the drive . They have their car . Call Jarvis . Let her follow . Jean , tell me where you are , where you go . We want to help you . No . That does not work . No one can help me . Why would it be different now ? I know you want to kill anyone , but listen . The virus that you have in you , is extremely deadly . I 've always been toxic . I poisoned all my relationships . - This is different . - Yes . Through them it 's now reality . My parents always I was a walking disaster . If she 's knew how similar they were . Jean , it does not have to go . If you want , this may be over . Find a deserted place , stop the car and waiting for us . I do not need you . - I 'll do it myself . - What are you doing ? I make an end to before there is a dead . An end-what ? - This conversation these days . Everything . No , Jean , wait . - Wait , listen to me ... Day , Baldwin . - She wants to commit suicide . - I do not know if that helps . Who knows spreading the virus again . - Do we have her location ? - Yes . She goes westward at 99 . Jarvis has three helicopters in the air . If they do not stop , she is burned . Vacation ? - How long ? - A month or two . I do not know . Would the center , the movement that can be used ? I do not know ... but I 'm sure that I can use . I think a long weekend should be enough . - Puget Sound is fun . - You do not listen . I ignore you . That 's different . I 'm not saying I can not do this . I will lead this movement . But Jordan just died and I need time in order to deal with . You have to move but mourn , like the rest . That hot mature . Not lecture me my responsibilities . You just got here . And if I 'm needed here like you always say then you need sometimes around me work . Around you ? You can . Mary O 'Connell . Disappeared in 1972 . Promising empath . Robert Fields , 1987 . Genius with numbers and pattern recognition . - John Gersten . - Who are they ? Alternates . Possibly . No one is as capable as you but I want to forward , with you or another . Jordan sometimes also spoke to me like that . He could persuade me well . But you ? You 're not quite there yet . You healing gift makes you unique . Jordan knew . I believed it . I came here to work with you . You ask me to you to work around that can not . Then you 'll have a lot of time stop in your list because I 'm going . It will not be difficult . Be in demand pattern recognition . That 's impossible . Mortimer and Falcone contributed the latest antibiotic stuff . That are made to anthrax to stop . They 're dead , Marco . What it spreads is ingenious than the anthrax virus . If it comes through that address , the antigen work on subatomic level . - Making it is unstoppable . - Yeah , pretty much . Mortimer and Falcone Jean were afraid with their entry . Can the spread of the virus have to do with emotions ? That is possible , even likely . Her medicine cabinet is just a flashing neon sign : " Personality . " She cortisone creams for stress rash an assortment of the better psycho-pharmaceuticals Xanax , Prozac Yeah , we get it , Marco . She 's a wreck . And wreck whose body works as a delivery for the virus that they create , like flowers spreading pollen . What ? She spreads spores ? Something like that . Spores are reproductive organs spread by a circulatory system . The human body is a large vascular system . It works with a blood flow . Which can speed up or slow by moods , feelings ... If Jeans blood faster if she is angry , confused , upset or whatever is a deadly virus spread . We are close to her car . Do you have any tips ? Make her get hurt . - Hey . - Hi . - How are you , Lily ? - Good . I heard that you 're leaving for a while . That was fast . I ... I do not know how long I be gone . What will you do ? Firstly , I disappear for a while and then ... I do not know . We 'll see . I do not work here to heal people so I can go anywhere . So you go around the world roam as in Kung Fu ? I do not walk with a bald head and a robe but seems it out further . You can take this . View the return address , stop in Gloucester , Massachusetts rapid healing and then on again . - You know the letters . - Shawn , they are everywhere . One sadder than the other . It 's almost too much . I got an idea of . But you go away so we discuss 'T do when you get back . No , Lily , I meant it , I do not know when that is . So I 'd like to hear what you have to say . Well , I thought ... We have no hospital or charity but come every day thousands of requests . No wonder it overwhelms you . - We are not furnished . - Exactly . Therefore I have to leave here . What if we set up a foundation ? Associated , yet separate . With a staff whose job it is to open those letters and search. worst cases of People who only we can help . Then we have to say no against thousands of others . That 's right , Shawn , but what if we against one say yes ? You can find a person healed per day every day . It is difficult to find who most deserves . Then you need to form a committee containing doctors and social workers . And you . I mean , it 's your idea . Then you have to be there to accomplish it . But I 've just taken a job by staff . I can I think about places . POLlTlE Al - ' s body ? - We can not reach it . Once that is possible , we must have it . She said she it wanted to make . ' s end Then Marco and the boys back to the basement . Show them the domino effect here but on finding . Excuse me . Baldwin . I was almost done , but I do not know . - Jean . - I could not . Nobody wants you dead . Tell me where you are . No , you can not help me . The 4400 center can not help me , but that does not matter . I finally know where to go . Tell me where , I 'll see you there . - Have you read the Bible , Baldwin ? - I went to Sunday school . I read it today , in that motel . " The time is at hand . " Is not that from Revelation ? But you know what it means ? Probably not . You see those blisters forming on my hands . - Do you understand ? - I do not believe it . They talk about me in that book . - Do you have a family ? - Jean , where are you talking about ? Go to them . Keep them very tightly . I finally understand why I was sent. back I 'm a part of their plan . They want me to do this . That you do what ? Purify humanity . They quoted Revelation ? That 's never a good sign . First they wanted to help , stop all this , but now she thinks she is the Apocalypse . What will they do ? They said they want she does this , right ? So the hair is taken out of your hands . - Fate ? She 's not responsible . So you can handle to be. a walking plague Pretend you do not decide . She wants to firmly no more about it . She just wants it 's over . We know how they think , but not where it is going . She goes on autopilot . You know what I think ? They will do what they wanted to do appear before it started to rain . Marco . Is it today Tuesday ? " Tuesday : Robs dog wash " It 's Wednesday , Marco . My mistake . She only has a plan for today . They will apply for unemployment benefits in downtown Portland . Damn . I can not believe . I dream or not said that Chicago would win ? - You know how much I have ? Bet - $ 200 . Earlier my mother diamond engagement ring . And now it 's gone , because I believed you because I trusted you . And you have disappointed me . You lied to me . You said it did not matter . You said you liked me anyway . Oh , so you knew that Chicago would lose ? From the beginning this was a test . A foundation ? Do not you think that there is enough to do ? It is one per day . Once it runs does not have to cost. much time I thought you wanted privacy . Allows you step right in the spotlight . Yes , but on my terms . It would be good PR . Not too hard to start . We can get big names filter for that committee . - It seems like a good idea . - I 'm glad you approve but I was not for your permission . I should hope not . PORTLAND ARBElDSAFDELING Jean . Baldwin ? - That 's right . - You should have stayed away . Look around you . These people have done nothing to hurt you . They also did nothing to help me . But it does not matter . I do not have a choice . I do what they want . You don ' t accept . You have a choice . Especially like when I was kidnapped . I never had a choice . They have the right person . What are you doing here anyway ? You should go back to your family . No , I 'm just where I wanna be . You must have a desire to die . You think you have to kill people I must stop . You are infected , and that is wrong but you do not mass murderer to be . I have been a killer . You have no killed deliberately . That you 're doing now . Whatever you think about the fate you 're wrong . You do not have to do . Do not be . Want to hear something funny ? I ... I believe you . But it 's too late . They are about to explode . I can not stop . - It itches so . - Okay . Really . What a day . How are you ? Well ... I have Monday a psychiatric interview . Thousands of people rescued . But I have someone slain . You did what you had to do . I do not know if this is the right time but I made you something . It is a kind ... MALA 'S DIARY A Nepversie of Maia 's diary . Fopt almost everyone .

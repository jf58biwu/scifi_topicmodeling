 Female attendant : Welcome to the attic . We 're so glad to have you . She 's expired already ? She just arrived . Strange . She seemed fit enough to be a lifer . So young and so fit . It 's a shame really . Victor and sierra- - where are they ? We ... We don 't use active-codes here . We use your real names . my real name is echo . It 's okay . I 'm right here , see ? Look at me . I 'm gonna get us out of here , okay ? We got to move now . Hey ! Hey ... Echo : No ! No ! Behind you ! No ! Female attendant : Welcome to the attic . We 're so glad to have you . His eeg electroactivity readings are so slight , It 's probably just static in the bedsheets . I see . I 've tried homotopic and heterotopic stimulation . Haven 't we all ? You don 't view this as a thrilling new project ? You should be bouncing off the walls . I 'm running out of options . Paul has extensive cortical scarring . That part of his brain is done . Irreparable . If I 'm going to try anything else , I need to install the active architecture . And even then , there 's no guarantee it 'll take . Well , I haven 't spent all this time nurturing an asset just to throw it away . Get him stable enough to handle the architecture , And from there , I 'll consider what 's next . Alpha mapped his entire brain . I 'll try and piece it back together . Maybe not . I plan on making some changes around this house today . Perhaps his petulant personality is a good place to start . And we are in the market For a strapping new victor , are we not ? Is everybody in this house in a coma ? Sorry . No , by all means . You want a blankie ? I was waiting for you . Guess I dozed off . Haven 't been getting much sleep lately . Some stuff going on at home . Wow , I thought you were here 24-7 . I was when I had reason to be . What do we know about the attic ? No one comes back , boyd . But why ? What do they do to them in there ? I don 't know . Experimenting , torture ... I think they 're testing the limits of the human mind . The brain is kept in a fear-induced , Adrenaline-fueled , overdrive state . Like a problem you can 't solve . Either the nightmare lasts forever , or ... Or it doesn 't last at all . Hey ! Wait . Don 't be afraid . ¶ ¶ Well , that 's new . The premotor cortex is , like , 15 % functional . The posterior parietal cortex doesn 't look as bad . Yeah , but the sma 's just scar tissue . And the m1 's totally fried . Even with active architecture , He won 't be able to execute basic commands . It 's like his brain is football team , And I 've got this whole new set of brilliant plays , But it doesn 't matter , Because the quarterback 's in jail for dog fighting . Yeah , and it 's not like his brain can run the wildcat formation . That joke went under my head . Wildcat formation ? The running back takes a direct snap from the center ? The quarterback doesn 't even touch the ball ? It 's a sports analogy . You started it . Wait . Don 't shut up for a second . You might be on to something . Wildcat formation . Topher 's world . Yeah . I got it . Adelle wants to see you . Did she say why ? Does she ever ? Hey , darth vader kills lieutenants , not storm troopers . Thanks . I 'll be right back . Cool . I love you , pretty horsie . I think we can all safely say that this isn 't real . Dr. Saunders ? I don 't think that 's a smart idea . Boyd , where am I ? What am I doing here ? Echo , you stir things up , You might bring the storm on yourself . There are not a lot of good people here . There aren 't ? What about my friends ? Where are my friends ? You have no friends . Now be quiet . Or I 'll find something to stuff that mouth up . How are you feeling ? Not exactly good as new . The headaches are getting worse . Everything 's going to be all right . Now that you 're here . Thank god . And how are you doing ? After alpha . I 'm a ghost . You can 't fight a ghost . This- - this isn 't right . This isn 't right . This isn 't real . What happened ? Come on , echo , be your frickin ' best . What happened to you ? Happened to you ? Dewitt . There is only one place where a doll Is irreparably damaged as you . The attic . You 're not real . That 's real ! That 's very real . There you are ! So it 's you ! You just can 't ... Stop ... Trying to kill me ! I 'm not trying to kill you ! It is ! What it ? ! Down ! Of course , you 'd be in my nightmare . You were rossum 's rising star . No , I was a defect , And I 'm pretty sure you 're in my defective head . No , I 'm in the attic trapped inside my own mind . This is my mind ! Are we really arguing about this ? I 've accepted it . I chase arcane , I try To stop him from killing . The reality changes , But the enemy stays the same . I 'll never rest and I 'll never catch him . That 's pretty cool and all , And I don 't want to ruin your whole highlander vibe , But I 'm pretty positive that this is my mind . I think you just saved my life , for real . What-what do you mean ? That 's the tree from one of my childhood homes , And those are my hateful relatives playing croquet . And that ... That 's a long story . How is this possible ? I think you are real . I can feel it . I 'm not making you up or remembering you . All of the minds in the attic must be connected somehow . Adelle finally put you in the attic . I could feel it with that monster , too . " arcane . " It 's what he calls himself . I was trapped inside the nsa . It felt like years . He came there to murder me . I-I fought back , and I chased him out , And I 've been chasing him ever since . So you travel from mind to mind ? I guess so , yeah . I need to know how . I need to find my friends . He 'll probably go after them . He targets newcomers . He might even lead us right into their heads . How do you track him ? How does he get in and out ? He can sense fear . He finds something that you 're deeply afraid of . This would be the much badder kind . Multiple minds thinking as one . You 're absorbed . The individual ceases to exit . This would be a much badder kind . You 're absorbed . Multiple minds thinking as one . You 're absorbed . My worst nightmare . That would be the point . Hold on . We don 't even know where he 's going . We have to travel together . A stranger 's mind 's a big place . It 's easy to get ... Lost . Thank you . Oh , good afternoon . How are you ? Um ... Lost ? Hey , wildcat . Hey , hey , I 've been thinking about your theory , And it might work . Why not bypass the motor cortex ? We can reprogram another part of the brain To serve its function . Reprogram it To think it is the primary motor cortex And always has been . Obviously , we can 't use his medulla oblongata , But there are plenty of parts that 'll work perfectly . We just have to decide what to sacrifice . Sarcasm ; already doesn 't have that . Memories of high school . Fear of dancing . What 's up ? How was your " come to jesus " with dewitt ? What did she say ? Hey ... Hey ... Don 't speak to me . What did you say to ivy ? I merely prepared her For the possibility of taking over Your position here . What ? My position ? What are you gonna do with me ? I 've done nothing wrong , apart from the things That got you your job back . You gave us extraordinary technology Which will be used soon . The question is whether you have anything more to offer- - Whether you can accept radical change Or if you 'll buckle under pressure . I don 't buckle . Occasionally I swashbuckle . Yes , you 're quite a pirate hero , Swinging in and dismembering nolan kennard . If you try to keep secrets from the corporation , You may have every expectation Of being chopped into pieces yourself . How do you imagine that would feel ? Do you know a way out of here ? Oh , I can 't leave . I must stay And try to enjoy myself . Thank you . Wouldn 't want to end up in the attic . But this is the attic . Rossum 's been watching me closely Since I moved here to tokyo Ningyo kaoku . Have you seen my friends ? I thought I saw them , but I was imagining it . But I do think they 're really in here . Well , I wouldn 't worry . I 'm sure they 're enjoying themselves . I love you . I 've always loved you . I know . We 're cornered ! Oh , contact front ! They got us pinned down pretty good , sergeant . Any ideas ? I think it 's a small company trying to act big With this barrage . There 's no air support . We should just hold up . We got to take away the high ground . Lay down suppressive fire ! Give me a window to flank from the left ! Myers , you 're with me . What did you mean when you said Rossum was keeping an eye on you ? In my recent transfer to tokyo , I was asked to report any areas of weakness . Rossum 's mainframe was both fallible and vulnerable . Vulnerable how ? Well , that 's why I 'm here , isn 't it ? Having that information made me a point of weakness . Rossum put me in here To eliminate that point of weakness . Hey , but it 's better than being in the attic . Not really . We have to run . Oh , I can 't leave . I have to stay please ... And try to enjoy myself . We have to go now ! But I can 't leave till I 'm done . Ugh ! Oh , stop doing that ! Sorry . It took me forever to find you . Arcane is here . I know . Listen , not only are the people in the attic connected , But all the attics in different dollhouses All over the world are connected . This dude 's hooked up in japan . You think ? Oh , god . Now the meat won 't be fresh . What happens when arcane kills someone ? The world disappears . Aw , he 's dead ; his brain 's shutting down . Then we 're trapped in it . You 've been dragging your heels a bit lately , mr . Langton . Tardy even . Spending more and more time out of the office . I 've been taking care of personal stuff . Ooh . And this stuff , is it top secret ? It 's personal . Are you still upset over echo ? We all are . Yes , but you , You ... you 've always been like a father to her . And you took her away from me ! Shelved her . My only goal was to protect that girl . You knew where she was heading . You encouraged her . You put her in that attic as much as anyone else . Is that what you tell yourself ? You didn 't come to the dollhouse because of echo . You came because you had nowhere else to go . You work for rossum , and that means Your options tend to slim , to three : Carry out rossum 's work without question , The attic ... Or death . The moment you stepped into this house , You , in effect , gave us your life . And you must decide if that life is be put to good use Or laid to waste . I have seen the future , mr . Langton . And it is not for the weak . I 've been through this before . Well , then what do we ... We got do the thing He fears most to get out of his mind , thing he dreads . Good times . Lay down suppressive fire ! Give me a window to flank from the left ! Myers , you 're with me . What are you doing ? ! It 's not safe here . Reinforcements are pinned down South of herat . There 's no air support . All right . Tony . Don 't be afraid . Take a breath . You 're in the attic . In the attic , man . None of this is real . Okay , fine . Wait a minute . I know you . Echo . You need to stop being afraid . This is all in your mind . That explains a lot . How long have we been in here ? Feels like years , but who knows ? And you ? Longer . So this murderer ... He 's called arcane . Chasing 's not going to do it . We got to take away the high ground . Go on the offensive ? We can 't anticipate where he 's going . We trap him . Lure him in , pin him down , Kill him then and there . And we 've got to hurry , Before he gets to priya . Priya 's in here , too ? You know , this is a scenario I never tried . Rigor mortis . The new viagra . It 's all in my mind . It 's all in my mind . Shh . There 's no reason to be afraid . You sure about that ? Oh , my god ! What have you done ? ! Arcane ? Uh , well , uh , clyde actually . So this is your mind , huh , clyde ? This is your worst nightmare ? No . This isn 't a nightmare . This is the shape of things to come . Does that take away the fear ? And the pain , too . Sometimes . That 's what we 're gonna do to paul , you know . Take something away . Yeah . I heard . That 's gonna make him more pissed off than he usually is . Not if we take away his anger . No . Anger will be all he has . That woman is gonna drag us straight to hell . You shouldn 't have brought me here ! It 's too dangerous ! That was the idea . Who are you ? How did you do that ? You people are aware ? Why do you call yourself arcane ? Sounded bad-ass . All right . No , no . Please . If I die , there 'll be nobody left To take down rossum . That 's my line . You were trying to kill us ! It was a necessary evil . I was trying to take out rossum 's mainframe computer . Wait . We heard something about that . The mainframe is vulnerable . How do we take it out ? Is it accessible from inside the attic ? Tell us how to destroy it . No , no , no . You don 't understand . That 's the problem . You , me , everybody in the attic , We are the mainframe . What do you mean " we are the mainframe ? " We all have repeating wors t - case scenarios , right ? Problems we 're continually trying to solve . Yeah , okay . Well , that 's because the people in the attic , Our brains , are being used as processors , Human computers . H-how is that even possible ? Well , it 's more practical really . The human brain is 20 times More powerful than the most massive Multiprocessing computer in the world . Rossum has hundreds of them . Hundreds ? Well , many attics , all networked to a central hub . Our brains continually soaked With adrenaline from the fear , running on maximum . The processing power behind rossum . And you were killing people . I 'm trying to put them out of their misery , Freeing them from an eternal hell . But mostly , I was trying to take out rossum 's number of cpus . To prevent this . How do you know this is true ? Because , uh , It was my idea . We need to hole up , find someplace safe ! It 's your head , genius . Go , go , go . get back ! Let 's go ! In my scenario , I was constantly fighting myself , At war . Just trying to get home to my girl . In mine , I was constantly making love to you . Oh ? And then you 'd turn into the rotting corpse Of a rapist I killed . Oh . Talk to us , clyde . Talk ! I 'm one of The original founders of rossum . One of two , actually . Me and my best mate At university . I had discovered ecc ... Ecc ? Encephalic communication and coding . He was the one that had a plan for it . I hadn 't even begun to imagine all The possible applications for the technology . We thought we were making history . We weren 't wrong . How did you end up here ? Uh , it was the very beginning . Our first test subject was to be Imprinted with my own personality . We both agreed that it would be Too dangerous to imprint a persona With my knowledge and ambition . So we slightly modified Clyde 2.0- - we called him- - Modified his persona to have No aspirations so that he would just follow orders . And your friend betrayed you . Yes . Another possibility I hadn 't imagined . He was the only one I trusted . He gave clyde 2.0 the order to betray me . That 's how , uh , the attic was founded . They cleared my head out , Hooked me up , I became a human computer . First one in history , I suppose . And you 've been here ever since ? Yes . That was 1993 . Oh . My nightmare , my loop , has been To run statistical probability scenarios For where the technology might lead . All but three percent of them Include the end of civilization . What year is it ? 2010 , I think . We don 't know how long we 've been off the air . 2010 ? That 's all ? Then there 's still time . We might still be able to stop them ! That 's our mission . Listen , the first thing they 'll do is try to install An imprinted person in the government . Yeah . They did that . They did ? They did ? Then they 're way ahead of my schedules . Your friend who betrayed you . What 's his name ? Who is this man ? I don 't even know if it is a man . That 's the first thing they erase . I can 't remember faces or names , Not to mention the fact that clyde 2.0 's Probably switched bodies by now . If we could eliminate that backstabber , And the copy of me that does his or her bidding , Then we might be able To stop them . But there 's no way out of here , is there ? No . There isn 't . Believe me . I-I 've tried . And even if we could find a way out , We 'd just be putting a blank face To a name we don 't even have . There has been talk a-amongst Some of the security personnel That they place here . They mistakenly let a woman in . She saw them . She could identify them . But apparently , they got to her , too . They scrubbed her clean . So , we still have no way of telling ? Caroline . Yes ! Caroline ! That was it . Wait , echo . Why does that sound familiar ? It 's me . I was caroline before I became echo . Do you have any memories of ... ? Not hers . Not in here . We 've got to find a way out of the attic . There is no way out . What if someone unplugs us from the outside ? Our minds are engaged , Integrated . Disconnection will fry the circuits , Turn our brains to mush . I 'm sorry . Echo ! Echo , get down ! Wait . What are you doing ? I know a way out . He 's not going to take this well . Happenized tommoroveretley . Tomowaning ! Diamisordinary ! What 's happening ? It didn 't work ? His brain is completely reorganized . It will take a minute to adjust . Wait , wait . No . Hey . What the ... Hell- - What the hell did you do to me ? ! You were in a coma , paul . Alpha damaged your brain . We did it to save your life . Did what ? You made me a doll ? Active architecture was the only way to save you . Then why do I feel like myself ? You are , but it 's an imprint . I 'm sorry . It was an order . And we need you , paul . We don 't have many friends left . What do you mean ? Echo , sierra , victor . They 're in the attic . Wait . Hey . This should be interesting . At some point , He 's going to figure out what we took away from him . I know . I 'm not afraid to lose my life taking you down . I don 't want to die . Then only one of us is going to b disappointed . Any last words ? Oh , god . No , echo . Listen . My worst-case scenario , my loop , Was getting out of the attic . The place where our bodies are hooked up . I think I can unplug . Won 't her brain turn to mush ? No . When a person flatlines , the computer disengages . That 's right . It would . To avoid any corrupted data . If I can flatline and manage to wake up , Then I can get out of here and send help . Your-your plan is to come back from the dead ? Then you 'll be there to revive us When we flatline . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Wait a minute . No . No . I can 't risk you two ; I 'm not normal , So I think I can do this . I 've been through worse . And we haven 't ? Priya , please . The only way this scenario worked Was if I didn 't have to fight for you two . Then we 'll fight for ourselves . You don 't have to look after us anymore . You 've been inside our minds . You know we 're just as abnormal and just as ready as you . We 're a team now . We go together . We go together . Are you in ? I 'm staying . I want out , But there are hundreds of people being tortured here . Rossum 's feeding off it . I got to help them . Clyde ? Well , my body 's halfway across the country , anyway . We 'll teach them to be aware . Face their fear . Might even be fun . That would be nice . Hey . If you succeed , and you can get a signal to me , We 'll shut down the mainframe . I guess I 'm glad I never did kill you . Don 't get sloppy . Here goes everything . ¶ no , I don 't remember ¶ ¶ what brought us to this ¶ ¶ what places we blindly pass ¶ ¶ what turns we missed ¶ ¶ when things really mattered ¶ ¶ and we really cared ¶ ¶ when simply being was easy ¶ ¶ just having you there ¶ ¶ the life I knew by heart ¶ ¶ and lived every day ¶ ¶ the secret codes and signs ¶ ¶ you and I , eye to eye ¶ ¶ wake me up ¶ ¶ hurt me , you have to ¶ ¶ I forgot how to cry ¶ ¶ remind me of who ¶ ¶ I used to be back when ¶ ¶ nothing could come between us then ¶ ¶ that thought will never leave us ¶ ¶ so remind me of how ¶ ¶ I used to feel ¶ ¶ remind me of who ¶ ¶ I used to be back when ¶ ¶ nothing could come between us then ¶ ¶ that thought would never leave us . ¶ We got it . The information we were looking for , maybe more . I understand the mainframe . And I know how to get at the heart of rossum , Or at least someone who will . Your plan worked . Thank you . There is only one place for a doll as irreparably damaged you . The attic . They say it 's whatever hell you imagine . But I think it 's something far worse . I think the attic is where rossum is keeping Some of its darkest secrets . They are rabid in their protection Of whatever 's hidden there . And you want me to go in ? I need you to go in . Far more importantly , I need you To come back ... And bring the secrets with you . It 's the only way we 'll ever gain an edge . " we " ? We can bring them down . Nobody 's ever gotten out of the attic . Nobody else is you . And everyone else ? I think I 've impressed upon them the dangers we 'll be facing . We 're ready . No . We 're one soldier shy . It 's time for me to meet caroline . It 's time to win her war .

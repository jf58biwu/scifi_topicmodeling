 The flight of Antares . A grand tour of the solar system . I think the obvious question is simply , what the hell happened ? We don 't really know . One minute , we 're on the mission , the next minute , we 're off . I 'm having a dream about this mission . - And ? - You and I are both on it . And Ajay , will he be coming back on the floor ? Goss wants to do a thorough psych eval . And if he passes ? He won 't pass , Rollie . You know I want babies with you , don 't you , Rol ? Plenty of time for that when you get back . Do you have any ... ? I 've had a vasectomy . If he 's telling you he had a vasectomy , then he 's telling other women the same thing and he should be outed . BABY CRIES TED : What do you know , Eve ? Beta knows . We need you to visit pod four , honey . It chose you . Maybe it 'll give you an answer . HEARTBEAT HE SCREAMS BEEPING What 's happening with Ted ? Heart rate 's spiking to 190 , BP 230 over 110 . Heart attack ? Not yet , but I can get Evram to run a scan and ... No . We handle this without him . Excuse me , but it 's my responsibility to make sure ... Stand down , doctor . This is ours . Ted . Are you there ? INTERCOM : ' Come in , Ted . ' HE PANTS 'Switch to comm four . He 's not answering . ' DONNER : ' I 've always believed 'that doors are meant to be opened . 'That 's why they have hinges and knobs . 'You put up a barrier , 'and somebody 's going to walk through it . 'It 's human nature to want to know what 's on the other side , 'and to ignore the obvious catch . 'Doors are there for a reason . ' Yo . I 'm done in a sec if you want to run . Ted ? Ted ? 'Admit it . It 's a breakfast burger from Momo 's . 'I can smell the bacon . ' Jen , I feel fine . They 're monitoring me . Babe , you 're sick . They 've got you on thinners , for God 's sakes . So what are you doing there ? You working on the rabbit embryos ? You 're changing the subject . Answer the question . It 's a special project for me and you , OK ? It 's a surprise . How 's Ted doing ? He settling in ? Yeah , he 's fine . So far , we 're on course . No speeding tickets . He 's not you , Rollie . I know ... but he left a wife and kid back here . There 's a lot being thrown at him right now . The crew should go easy . Roger that . Just ... look out for him , will you ? Of course I will . You were in pod four . I saw Mars , Eve . BREATHES HEAVILY Mars ! I was there . Well , you 're stable now . You 're going to be fine . Does it do this ? When it 's trying to tell you something . Has it happened to you ? Just me ... and one other person . Ted , I have wanted to tell you everything . You have no idea how hard it 's been ... You are my wife ! And I was ISO before that . Ted , this wasn 't my call , you have to believe me . I need you to go back . Go back ? No , this isn 't about us . It 's trying to communicate with you . It 's chosen you just like it chose me . OK , form 24 for today ... That is astro-speak for " daily schedule , " My fifth graders from Burnaby , British Columbia . Zoe and Paula , you 'll run the lander through guidance , navigation and control . Jen ? Uh , ongoing fertility experiments . Phosphorylation in microgravity . Sperm move faster up here , kids . Ugh . And you , Donner ? Uh , bus run down and finding the leak in the Venus suit . Eso es muy importante . Up here , safety comes first . Evram ? Status on psych evals ? Door 's wide open . Any takers ? Dr Mintz is our doctor and resident psychiatrist . Life on Antares is a BIG adjustment , so it 's especially important that we share . Steven , you 'll continue your proton velocity report . Right after jell-o shots and origami . SHE COUGHS I 'll be on the flight deck with Ted , If we can find Ted . I think he 's in the shower . He 'll be down . SHE GROANS Paula ? You OK ? I 'm sorry . SHE RETCHES G-sickness . Whoa . Hello . Space cookies on the loose . Thus concluding the morning meal . Nice of you to join us . You got it , too ? I 'm fine . He sensed you might need an ear . That 's very big of him . It 's a commander thing ... Friend thing . Or whatever . I 'm here if you need me . Six years is a long time . Is she sure she wants to open that door ? Pilots read ? And biologist is a fancy name for " gardener " ? SHE CHUCKLES I was splicing genes while you were still playing with dolls , friend . Oh , I still play with dolls . Is that so ? Hey ! Beautiful day . Oh , it 's going to rain . Well , rain 's nature 's way of wiping the slate clean . And a leading cause of mould ... flooding . And pessimistic blonde ASCANS . Look , I don 't know why we can 't just be ... What ? Well , cordial . Cordial ? Yeah , maybe , maybe more than cordial . Cordial is as far as I go . Any particular reason for that ? Aren 't you the guy with the " I don 't date astronauts " rule ? Yeah . I mean , technically . I mean , why flirt with someone who , technically , you can 't even ask out for dinner ? It 's a rule worth keeping , Donner . And it 's my rule , too . All right . They 're called HALOs , like what angels wear . Stupid acronym . HALO ? Hormone Activated Libido Oppressors , first used in prison systems to curb the appetites of sexual offenders . We 're using them now for extended missions . Which we 'd want to do because ... ? Sexual urges destabilise the co-worker bond , causing lapses in judgment . In other words , relationships are toxic . You can have sex without a relationship . Yeah , but we 'd prefer you had neither . To that end , your assignment is to wear your HALOs for a period of 24 hours to get a sense of how they 'll function ... Behind the ear , Mr Fassenwelder ! STUDENTS CHUCKLE It 's Wassenfelder . LAUGHTER Want to switch with me ? Give me yours ... No . Thousands of years of reproductive evolution wiped out with a tiny green dot . How do we know what they put into these things ? Hormone weirdness can affect a foetus . Will you stop with the foetus ? Zoe , it 's not an option . You can 't have a baby right now , especially not Maddux Donner 's . . .side effects are rare , so they say . While we believe it 's a safer alternative to the messy side of cohabitation , as with all medical procedures , I must advise you of its detractors . That wasn 't funny . Oh , it 's funny , but I think this is ... Open . SHE GASPS It 's talking to her again . BEEP RAPID BEEPING May I help you , sir ? Yes . I 'm Ajay Sharma . I 'm the flight engineer ... Former flight engineer of the Antares . You might recognise me . Yes , sir . Yes , uh ... My credential seems not to be working . Please have a seat , sir , and I 'll call in and see what I can do . I 'm sure it 'll be fine . If you just let me in , I ... Please have a seat , sir . SHE RETCHES SHE VOMITS Yo , Paula Puke . Queen of the up-chuck . Mistress of heave . When my door is closed , that means I have intentionally put up a barrier for my privacy . And ? And if you wish to move through that barrier , you will need to ask for my permission . " Yes ? " is not permission . " Who is it ? " is not permission . The only thing that will give you permission to enter are the words " Please , come in " . But you , Steven , you are only going to get as far as " Who is it ? " Because after I hear your name , I am bolting the door . So you want me to leave ? Get out . Get out ! OK . So , Paula 's not doing the GNC with you ? Well , the last thing we need is vomit in the Venus lander . Yeah , the O-deck 's never gonna smell the same . Who 's her alt ? You know damn well who the alt is . STD - sexy , tragic Donner . AKA the clap . I 'm never gonna shake this guy , am I ? Uh , not for the next six years , no . You know , there 's this line you cross with men . You can be colleagues , then friends , then lovers , but can you go back ? I mean , does that line work in reverse ? Emotional rewind ? I don 't know . Yes , you do . I mean , you and I are both rewound , completely . We 've both moved on . Ted , Donner - we 're done . HALO secure ? HALO secure . Hey , Ted ? You all right ? You , uh ... you seem a little off today . Yeah , maybe a little . Huh . Well , I 'm gonna head back to the lander bay For the GNC . Paula 's still G-sick . Right , you 're the alt . Listen , there 's going to be a lot of back and forth today with control . I might need you there for it . Well , if I 'm not there , Nadia will be . Well , I 'd rather have ... You sure you 're all right ? Maybe just ... a little deja vu , that 's all . It 's a new mission , Ted . It 's not Mars . Roger that . You know ... they 're so concerned about our libidos . What about the halos for everything else ? This thing might have worked when I was in ninth grade , maybe . HALO versus the machine , right ? What can I say ? There 's whole lot of Ted . Give it to me ! It 's really itchy . I feel like it 's red . Is it red ? I don 't need chemical castration to do my job . Well , the guys do . Yeah , they actually think they can beat it . We can put a man on Mars , but we can 't find a way to kill his erection . Oh , they have , trust me . I 've seen studies on these things , and the only two results are limp and limper . Oh . THEY LAUGH Have they grown breasts yet ? No , they think they can beat the HALO . A male 's sexual weakness is second only to his stupidity . Meaning ? I think we can make some money on this . The rules are simple . If one of you big , strong astronauts can overcome the HALO ... Rise to the occasion . Pitch a tent . Then you win . But if you stay limp , sad , and small - Then we win . GIGGLING All right , who 's the bank ? That would be me . Cha-ching . Don 't do it . It 's a sucker 's bet . I 've seen the studies . 50 large on the one-eyed monster . 50 , double down . 50 , there 's another 50 , but we pick the place and time . All right , bring it on . Ante up , boys . Nice . Anyone else ? Any other takers ? Looks like we 're in business . Good for you , Paula . Yo , Ajay , spot me . Gambling brings on many miseries , erodes a man 's good name . Screw that . These babies are calibrated for size - average astronaut size . I can win this . Perhaps . I would still prefer not to get ... OK , look . Think of it as a bonding thing , becoming an astronaut rather than a geek . Geek ? You 're a geek . Geek . That 's what everybody 's saying . You 're a geek . This is against my better judgment . We 're in . All right . Is it cool ? Don 't touch me . Sorry . Yeah . No problem . Thank you . 'Copy that , Crossbow . Rate gyro sensor is engaged . 'Moving on to page seven . ' Roger that . Page seven . Landing sequencer engaged . I could 've done that . I 'm the pilot . Mm , the alternate pilot . Yeah , that 's the pilot for today . DAP Activated . AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE : ' Preparing lander for tertiary landing site . ' What 's that ? It 's a glitch in the digital autopilot . The landing navigation system 's gone to the tertiary site . The DAP 's automatically calibrated for the primary . Not according to the guidance module . Look , the numbers don 't sync with the ship . If GNC sends us to a different site on the day , the mission is toast . Forget the mission . You and Paula are toast . All right , it might be the trajectory control sensor . Might be ? Do you want to check it yourself ? You 're piloting . All right , I 'm the alt . Which is why you missed a step . I don 't think so . Why don 't we just hit reset , Donner , and start from the top ? 'Control , we 're gonna do a hard reset , ' and go to the top of page seven . Copy that . Excuse me . AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE : ' Preparing lander for tertiary landing site . ' Well , it seems the lander has made up its mind . It wants to kill us . 'Crossbow , are you seeing something we 're not seeing ? ' Something funky . The system 's switching us to the third landing site , The override 's not working . It shouldn 't be doing that . It might be an ESP microsurge . You check the DAP config ? Affirmative , and we 've hard reset three times . I 'm going to switch it over to manual , take a system check . Maybe I can isolate the bug . Hold off on that for now , Donner . Ted , are you in the loop ? Negative , control . I 'm on the flight deck and have been following . Nadia , do you know where he is ? Maybe doing his psych eval with Mintz ? All right , look , we don 't need Ted for this . I can do a manual check from here . Do you have Ajay down there ? He helped design the damn thing . Hold on a second . Ajay 's not an option . Is this Beta screwing with us ? I don 't know . I don 't think so . Where 's Ted ? He 's processing . He 's been through a lot . Well , he 's got to get over it and handle Donner . We can 't have him digging in the lander 's code . Uh , Donner , this is flight . Listen , we are going to power down the lander . Let it sit for a day and reboot . That 's your solution ? Hit the off switch and pray ? Look , I got a retriever at home with the croup , and I 've been stuck in board meetings all day . The lander is fine . Yeah , tell that to Zoe and Paula when they 're trying to land it . Powering Crossbow down now . Maybe Paula will have better luck . Well , I hope so . You gonna talk to Ted ? Yeah , I got it . Hey . Where the hell were you ? I 've been here . Well , we just ran the GNC I asked you to be up on the flight deck . Nadia was there . Nadia 's not the mission commander . She can 't say jack to Mike Goss . We 'll talk later . No , let 's talk about it now , OK ? I got a serious glitch with this landing sequence . I can find it if they 'd let me go after it . So find it . Yeah , well , they shut the lander down . Ted ? I 'm sure they had their reasons . What ? I 'm sure they had their reasons , Donner . Let me finish this . RETCHING AND GAGGING Paula , you all right ? PAULA : Leave me alone ! You got a couple head cases in crew quarters . Get on it . How 'd it go ? The landing sequence is screwed up . We rebooted three times , then they finally shut us down . Now tell me how it went . Fine . That 's it ? Fine ? That 's it . It was professional and cordial . Cordial ? In a very professional way . Hmm . Well , excellent . You don 't believe me . I believe you , and I 'm proud of you . Good . Despite the fact you 're wearing two halos . DANCE MUSIC PLAYS She 's most agile . Four-letter word for " manhood " ? That 'd be W-A-S-S . You 've overcome the mighty HALO ? Feelin ' a twinge . Give me a little girl-on-Wass action and that cash is mine . The hormone inhibitor kicked in about an hour ago , working its way from the amygdala region of his brain down into his bloodstream . Looks like big Ted 's little Ted ! HE LAUGHS I 'm going to take this thing off . No , you don 't . Not with my money , you 're not . Come on . Focus . This is like a race , OK ? I want you to think of it like a long , hard race . I 'm leaving . No , no , no . No way . No way . Come on . We 're making a point here . All right , this whole HALO Thing it 's about evening the field , gender-neutralising . If they can hack it , so can we . Don 't you get it ? This isn 't just a stupid bet . This ... this is war . It 's pathetic . Fine . Think of it as cultural , then . It 's a voyage to an unknown planet . Planet exploitation . Tell me these women go home feeling a sense of pride . They 're being humiliated . So it 's less humiliating to put on the wounded good girl act , so a man will pay attention ? Excuse me ? Come on . I see the way you look at Donner , hoping he 'll glance over here . If you want him , go , get him . Oh , you are sadly mistaken . Yeah , the last thing she needs is to get involved with Captain Limp and the noodle gang . Then you won 't mind if I switch teams for a while . What ? You 're going to help them beat us ? No . I just like getting naked . Oh , my God . Is she even human ? Oh , sweet mama , thank you . She 's not interested in you , Steven . Don 't be such a tight ass . Nadia ! Nadia , Nadia ! This is game over right here . Don 't go for it . Don 't do it . Don 't do it . Don 't do it . Whoo ! Is that a setup ? Is that a setup ? Can I go now ? Hell , yes . Are you going to be OK ? No . Yes , I 'm fine . Just ... tired. Bye , Zoe . Come on . Just a little bit . You know what ? I surrender . This is too good . I can 't beat this . Give the young guys a try . Shock them , you know ? Come on , Maddux . Maddux ! In your dreams . Ajay ... respect. We have a winner ! We have a winner ! MEN SHOUT AND CHEER They just told me you were out here . I 'm sorry . Um , I brought some of the stuff from your locker - crew suit ... I heard they put you in research . I was permitted to pick up the keys to my flat and my mail , but my gym card was revoked . Yeah , well , the upside of heart plaque-sanctioned sloth . I haven 't been able to make myself go back in ... to my apartment , to unpack my boxes . When I left , when I packed them , I was an astronaut . You 're still an astronaut , Ajay . I 'm in research now . You know , I never realised how much I treasured the connection to this place . The people ... That sense of belonging . Nice night . It 's , uh ... I just felt a drop . Ever the pessimist . Not much back there to cheer me up . Nah ... Nobody ever got smart from drinking . You know , FYI this bus only comes here on the hour after ten . Yeah , I can 't afford to take cabs . Ah . I used to play ball when I was a kid . Yeah , I used to get up every morning at 6 : 00 to go throw with my dad . I was gonna be the greatest pitcher Cedar Rapids little league ever saw . And were you ? I fell off the jungle gym and broke my arm three days before the tryouts . Little league had a rule - no broken bones , no exceptions . But I went anyway , cos I figured that , uh ... they 'd look , see past the cast , and , you know , see what really mattered , that I had heart . I wanted to play . Did they let you try out ? No , I had a broken arm . But , uh , I showed up . So , your point is , rules are rules , no exceptions . That doesn 't mean I can 't take you out to dinner . You know , I mean , as colleagues or something . Actually , Donner , I think it does . Ajay , you 're a stud , baby . Swipe it , collect it , learn to respect it . Show me the money , honey ! He did it . He got one . What happened to " limp and limper " ? Hey , the test studies didn 't have Nadia giving lap dances . I barely looked at him . They say science is the great leveller . Pfft . There 's no decency . There 's no ethics . SHE VOMITS Yo , Paula Puke ! Maybe it 's a good time to go home . Roger that , because I...am broke . You want to share a cab ? Only if you 're buying . I wanted to ask you some questions about your last paper , you know , " Functional genomics - the N2 fixings of ... BOTH : " filamentous cyanobacteria . " You ... you read that ? Yeah , I did . It was fascinating stuff . Really ? I mean , because , I mean , nobody ... Nobody read that . Well , I also know you like pie . ( Cafeteria gossip . ) And I know a great place on the way . Sure . Yeah , why not ? We 're moving the party over to Major Tom 's and the guys are buying . Oh . You know what , man ? It 's an early day tomorrow . Come on ! Well , are you sure ? What , you want to go ? Well , if the boys are buying , yeah . You know what ? I am gonna make sure Paula gets home . All right . OK . All right . Bye . Something 's clearly wrong with him . The whole crew knows it . I mean , he 's not talking to Mintz . Donner can 't get through to him , and if Donner can 't ... I guess Rollie 's right . It 's going to fall to me . He 's withdrawn . He 's introspective . It 's not unusual when confronting the universe . Physically , he 's fine . And Paula ? She 's in her quarters . You know , she 's not drinking enough . I 'm pushing liquids . Paradoxically , I wish I were drinking more . Are you wearing your medication patch ? My withdrawal symptoms are under control , Doctor . Je m 'ennuie de toi . I miss you , too . It 's a lonely planet without you . I know . We always face the unknown alone . The astronauts ' genome analysis . Thank you . It 's a virtual impossibility that all eight of the Antares crew have the same euchromatic and heteromatic gene variations . What are you suggesting ? I 'm not suggesting anything . The crew 's physiology 's changing . Lining up like points on a grid ! I know something up there is causing this , caused the plaque that grounded Rollie and Ajay , is probably causing the crisis with Ted right now ! Something 's happening , and I need to know why . There 'll be no going back , Claire . Once you open this door , you can 't close it . Do you understand ? Analyse the genome of this . My name is not " Paula Puke . " My name is Paula Morales , and Paula Morales does not get G-sickness . Paula Morales WILL pilot the Venus lander . SHE VOMITS Paula Puke doing her variation of the dry heave in B-flat minor . They should build these things with thicker walls . Paula ? PAULA : Go away ! I just need to sleep . BABY CRYING Oh ... don 't tell me you have it too . No , I 'm fine . I just need to walk . Is it me , or is everybody on this ship crazy ? You can see the moons of Jupiter . Ganymede ... Europa , Callisto . Never gets old . Yeah , not on day four . Yeah , around the same time , congestion , backache and insomnia begin to work their magic . Mm , loss of appetite and ... nausea... Mm , and don 't forget about the mental jujitsu - anxiety , excessive fear of danger , my favourite - paranoia . They 're all normal things , Ted . I mean , they 're expected . Just , the way to get through all of this is to open up to the rest of us . And you don 't have to go through this alone . I 'm afraid I do , Jen . BABY CRYING WHOOSH BLEEPING Donner ? Are you hearing this too ? Yeah . Something 's running . It 's the lander . It 's supposed to be dark for 24 hours before reboot . Yeah , they 're programming it without us . You 're all the same . You 're one of them . Yes . It 's happening to me too . What 's going on ? Water ... Steven ? I 'm not playing that game ! I got my boundaries , baby . Remember those ? ( weakly ) Please . Ted ? Come on . Open up . HE KNOCKS All right , so mission control reprogrammed the lander last night Without bothering to tell us . We 're going to be looking at brand-new code . You know , I don 't know what your problem is right now , but , uh ... You know , if I can 't help you with ... You pull an all-nighter ? I got inspired , you know , bunny stuff . Thank you . Ted 's in his quarters , and he won 't come out . Hm . Yeah . I talked to him last night . You talked to Ted ? Rollie asked me to . " Be a friend . " He is going through a lot . So how 'd it go ? Well , if he 's hiding out in his room , apparently not that well . That wasn 't the question . Fine . I mean , it went fine . It was ... professional and cordial . Which is why you 're wearing two HALOS . I hear we 're going to have to adjust your dosage , Mr Sharma . You should be aware that that has caused me itching , which has led to a great deal of itching . HALOs are useless , wasted resources . And why is that , doc ? It 's never just about sex . It starts that way . It 's always more . Oh . Hey , pilot . Hey , gardener . I did 5k . That 's not bad for a hangover . 5k ... Yeah . Well , I got 2k and a nap in the park . So , listen , about last night , I did have a little bit to drink . Don 't sweat it . Co-worker immunity . You didn 't say what I didn 't hear . Professional courtesy ? Exactly . So we 'll stick to the rule ? The rule . That 's what we want , right ? Right . All right , well , I , uh , I should probably ... Sure . You should ... How 's Ted this morning ? Where is he ? In his quarters . He won 't come out . BLEEPING BLEEPING BLEEPING CONTINUES Hey , Rollie , something wrong ? You tell me , buddy . People are concerned . So is that what I 'm feeling ? Last thing you want is a shaky crew . I 'm fine . You 're hiding in your quarters . Don 't sling that bull at me . The Antares mission was my mission , And it 's my moral responsibility to make sure my replacement is doing me proud . So what 's really going on , Ted ? You feeling alone up there ? You scared about what you 're learning ? Or maybe this is about betrayal , Being hurt by the one person You thought you could trust . Well , you want to know how to deal with that ? I 'll tell you , bro . You suck it up . And if you 're lucky , stupid damn lucky , One day , that wound stops bleeding . You 'll always know it 's there , But you won 't always have to look at it . Not always . Not every day , And you 'll consider yourself blessed . So get your act together , Ted . There are seven other people up there depending on you , And one of them is my wife . My wife . You take care of her . The lander 's back online . Mission control won 't be pulling that crap again . Well , that 's good to hear . When 's the last time you checked on Paula ? Couple hours ago . She wasn 't letting anyone into her bay . She 's not the doctor , Mintz . I want her up and running And on that lander tomorrow for the GNC . Who woke him up ? Don 't know . He sure kicked our asses , though . 'It 's true that some doors are better left unopened . 'But you usually don 't realise that 'until you 're on the other side . ' Nice and easy . I 've killed men for less . 'We all make mistakes . It comes with the territory . 'Still no reason to live your life in one room . ' Are you sure you 're OK ? I 'm going in . DOOR WHOOSHES I love you . 'The doors we choose to open 'determine the path of our lives . 'Be they brave ... ' . .angry ... ' . .foolish ... ' . .painful ... 'We 're defined by what we do . 'By where we go . 'And you can 't go anywhere ... ' . .without opening the door . '

 NARRATOR : Previously on Heroes . I had a dream . I know what we have to do now . We need to bring this family together . And then we need to go visit my sister . Do you know about what happened at the place called Coyote Sands ? When your grandmother has a dream , it 's a good idea to pay attention . My father started writing the government looking for information on an abandoned government project in the 1960s . If you know something ... Never said what but it was around the time his nightmares kicked in . I could hear him yelling up here night after night . MOHINDER : The files are heavily redacted , but it mentions medical research at a place called Coyote Sands . My father was there . There it is . Peter and I are headed there now . I spoke with Nathan . He and Claire will meet us . I need you with us . This is where our story really begins . And to prepare for the future , you have to understand the past . You want the answers ? Then you 'll have to dig . It 's time everyone knew the truth . This is just wrong , digging up these graves . Why is she making us do this ? Mom has her reasons , Pete . She 'll share when she 's ready . Give her time . Come on , give him a chance . Why ? Look who he 's turned us into . He knows what he 's done , and he 's carrying enough guilt for all of us . But he 's here , isn 't he ? He needs our support . Boy , he charmed you . Don 't worry , happens to all of us . I 'm gonna go talk to her . What are we doing here , Mom ? You said we came here to find your sister . We didn 't know you had a sister . Look , we need some answers . Mom , what happened out here ? ( HONKING ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Angela ? Angela and Alice Shaw . ( CHUCKLES ) Good . That 's everybody . Welcome to Coyote Sands . My name is Dr. Chandra Suresh . Please , follow me . Take a snack . Playground . The dining room . The game room . We show movies every night . And the best popcorn you 've ever had . You have a funny accent . So do you . So , where are you from ? Bombay , India . I 've come a long way to meet you , to help you . These are your quarters , and your parents are just across the quad . Dr. Zimmerman will show you the way . ( BOTH CHATTERING ) Why do they have guns ? It 's alarming , I know , but this isn 't a prison . The guards are here for your protection . We want to keep you safe . Come on , let 's get you settled . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) I see you got the milk and cookies . We wanted to give you the official welcome . Welcome to Crapola Sands . I 'm Charles Deveaux . The guy with the funny accent is Daniel Linderman , and the guy with the glasses is Bobby Bishop . I didn 't think boys were allowed in the girls ' bunk . Yes , yes , well , Bobby here , he wanted to tell you how beautiful he thought you were . I did not . What ? You don 't think she 's beautiful ? ( EXHALES ) Anyway , we just wanted to say hi . I don 't like this . I wanna be with Mom and Dad . We already talked about this . It 's gonna be fun . Just like camp . Let 's get you unpacked . There is only toys and books in here . You said pack what I need . You need clothes , Alice . Pants , shirts , socks . And how many times have you read Alice in Wonderland ? ( SIGHS ) I wanna go home , Banana , and so do you . Prom is coming . The doctor told Mom and Dad that this place is gonna make my nightmares go away . No more screaming ? But what I have is genetic , so we all need to deal with it , the entire family . Who snuck you out to see Sleeping Beauty ? And who gave Jackie Jacobs an Indian burn when she stole your barrette ? I 'll always be there for you , I promise . But I need you to be there for me , too . ( EXCLAIMS ) See ? Everything 's gonna be fine . PETER : Mom ? My sister , my parents , they all died here . And if we don 't come together , if we don 't settle our differences , I 'm afraid history is going to repeat itself . 1961 was a different time . Kennedy was president . We were all patriots . When the government found out about us , they told us they could cure us , and we believed them . And they rounded us all up , and they put us here . What happened here ? I don 't know . I was lucky , I survived , but Alice , my entire family , didn 't . So , why are we here , Mom ? You could have told us this in a restaurant . Why here ? Why are we digging up those bodies ? I 've been dreaming about my sister . Alive . That doesn 't make sense , but my dreams often don 't . They 're open to interpretation . They 're confusing , but I think , I think I have to see her for myself . I have to find her body , find a piece of clothing . Something , anything , to give her a proper burial . You should have told us about this place , that you had a sister . I didn 't want you to know the pain . Mothers are allowed to do that . I 'm allowed to protect you . You 're absolutely allowed to do that , Ma . It 's my nightmare , Peter . I never wanted you to know what I suffered . I tried to forget . We made everyone forget . Who 's " we " ? How do you think the Company was formed ? It started here , with a vow to never let this happen again . We destroyed files , erased memories . We blackmailed , we killed , anything to keep our existence secret . And it worked for 50 years . Now , Noah and I have tried to fix this current situation , but Mr. Danko has proved resourceful . So , that 's what you were trying to do ? Yes . But you blew it ? Yeah . The important thing is to put our secret back , so we can all stop running , return to our lives . It 's time to go back to the old methods . You mean erasing people 's memories and killing ? It 's a necessary evil . I 'm sorry about what happened here , Mom , but it didn 't give you the right to do the things that you 've done , and it still doesn 't . We need you , Peter . I need you . The Company tore this family apart . I 'm not gonna be a part of it again . Peter . I 'll get him . ( WHOOSHING ) ( GASPING ) CHARLES : You had a nightmare . ( SIGHS ) What 's it to you ? Look , I heard you talking to your sister , about how your nightmares come true . Look , you 're not the only one who 's realized there 's something strange happening to them . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Linderman . How 'd a pretty skirt like you get a scar like that ? A bicycle accident . This place is one big science experiment , and we 're the rats . You 're wrong . They 're going to help us . She 's right . We 're freaks . They 're gonna make us normal . And you 're blind . Why do you think they have armed guards ? We 've done nothing wrong . It 's not like we 're communists . My dad said we can trust them . This has happened before . Nazis with the Jews . America did it , too , with the Japs . This is different . We 're different . What was your nightmare ? My dreams are confusing . They 're not always right . You have to stop being afraid and start believing . That doctor . Suresh . Don 't trust him . ( DOOR OPENING ) What are you talking about ? Nothing . We 're all going back to sleep . My feet are cold , Banana . That 's what you get for not bringing any socks . I 'll find you some . ( WHISPERING ) Say good night , Alice . ( WHISPERING ) Good night , Alice . I heard what you were saying to the boys , about Dr. Suresh . Those boys just have an overactive imagination . Remember when I got an F in History ? Dad took away the TV and dessert . I was so mad that I ... That night , a hail storm smashed his car . So ? I think I can control the weather . Is Dr. Suresh gonna come for me ? CLAIRE : Why didn 't you tell Nathan and Peter about your sister ? Where 's your father ? I asked for some alone time . With you . I want to help you . I was almost your age when I came here . I was 16 . Every other thought was about boys and the prom . I was so naive . I wish I had had half of your strength . You have courage and self-confidence . You 've overcome all those nagging self-doubts . Maybe sometimes . Not always . ( EXHALING ) I 'm still figuring it out . You dug up those graves without batting an eye . If I had had your spirit , if I had trusted myself , maybe things would 've been different here . Doesn 't answer my question . You ever do something so awful , something you are so ashamed of , that you think if you ever talk about it , you might never stop crying ? ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( WIND HOWLING ) Where did this come from ? This is what happened in my dream . It 's impossible . But it is . It 's her . It 's Alice . Dad ! Alice ! Alice ! Come on , we got to get back inside . You need to see a menu ? No , just a cup of coffee , please . Pete , we need to get through whatever it is that 's between us , and you 're not helping by running away every time things get a bit tough . Running away ? So , when you just up and disappear , you go wherever it is that you went , instead of staying in Washington and dealing with the problem that you created ... ( LAUGHS ) Pete , you know , nobody can look down their nose at me better than you . 1986 Mets . You remember that ? Yeah . How Dad had two tickets to the World Series , that he had two other tickets to the playoffs , and you convinced me to go to the playoffs with him . I wanted to make sure you got to see a game , yeah . Come on , Pete . I couldn 't have known the Mets were gonna beat the Astros . Come on . You got to see Mookie Wilson in that Game 6 . You saw him . I got lucky . You got to see that game . I got lucky . You think I conned you into seeing a playoff game ? Yes , I do . Because even in your generosity , Nathan , you were selfish , and that is just who you are . Pete , we have gotta find a way to forgive each other . We have to find the capacity for forgiveness , because without that ... I 'm trying . Really hard . ( HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING ON TV ) WOMAN ON TV : This is the Emergency Broadcast Network . A severe storm warning is in effect for the Greater Valley area . ( WIND HOWLING ) Claire ! Claire ! ( GROANS ) ( SCREAMS ) How did you find me ? Are there more agents coming ? I 'm not working with them anymore . I tried to stop them from the inside , and they found out . You expect me to believe that ? It 's the truth . I tried and I failed . Angela Petrelli brought us here . Why ? What business does she have here ? She was taken here as a child . This was a place for people with abilities . Experimenting . And eventually murder . What ? They killed hundreds . The graves are outside . What are you doing here ? I found this . Fifty years ago , my father was a doctor here . I came to find out what he was doing . Now I 'm not so sure I want to know . Hello , Alice . Angela , can I talk with you ? Yes , of course , Dr. Suresh . It 's okay , Alice . Three wavy lines . Who are they ? Don 't worry about them . Just focus on the cards , okay ? Let 's try again . A triangle . I 'm not reading your mind , if that 's what you think . I had a dream about this , about you showing me cards . A dream ? About this exact moment ? And does everything you dream come true ? They 're dreams . They 're confusing . And what else have you dreamt about ? About you . ( SOFTLY ) You 're going to kill everybody here . My parents , my sister . I can assure you , that 's not going to happen . You are a good man , and you 've treated us with nothing but kindness , but I 'm telling you , it 's going to get out of your control . If you leave , it destroys all our work . Don 't you see the benefits your abilities could have for the world ? I only see my nightmares . Einstein said , " The life of the individual has meaning ... " " ... only insofar as it aids in making the life of every living thing " nobler and more beautiful . " You 've read Einstein . No . I just dreamt that you would say that . ( EXCLAIMS ) You 've said yourself that dreams are confusing , open to interpretation . Everything is going to be fine , Angela . Now , this won 't hurt a bit . I tried to warn them . I tried to make them stop . I tried to save them , save Alice . And now Alice is alive . If this is your sister , then why is she doing this ? She 's angry . You don 't believe me . Storms happen . It 's my sister . What if it 's not ? No . I need to go find her . I need to deal with this alone . No , it 's too dangerous out there . ( WIND CALMS ) You okay ? What is it ? Your mom . She 's gone . ( SIGHS ) So what ? My father was Dr. Mengele ? You don 't know what happened here . It 's hard to ignore facts . Which are what ? He worked here . Everyone died , he survived . The most obvious answer is usually the right one . Working with the enemy doesn 't necessarily make you the enemy . You should know that . I met your father . He was a good man . You don 't know what he did , what he faced , what his intentions were . Who are we talking about ? Just don 't make any assumptions . Not until you know the truth . Any sign of my mother ? No . Nothing . She 's got to be around here somewhere . We 'll split up , cover more ground that way . No one should be alone . Suresh , will you go with Peter ? There 's no sign of her . You really think her sister survived this ? I don 't know . What was this place ? It 's where he experimented on them . I guess we 're destined to repeat our parents ' mistakes . How do you mean ? I mean I am my father 's son . Experimenting on human guinea pigs . But why ? Not for science , for self-interest . You 're being too hard on yourself , Mohinder . We started this a long time ago , okay , you and me . I know you . You 're a good person . Good intentions only go so far , Peter . I 'm weak , I am corruptible , and I am selfish . We 're all selfish . My brother 's proven that point time and time again . I know what it 's like to have parents who are less than . My mother brought us here because she wants to start a new Company . She thinks it 's the only way to keep this from happening again . But that first Company she started was corrupt . Yes , but why ? I mean , was it surviving this ? I mean , this has to come with fear and pain and anger . Maybe that 's why you can get it right . Because you never knew this pain . I have to believe that there is hope for redemption . I have to . Even for Nathan . Are you and Peter going to be all right ? I don 't know . He blames me for everything . Can 't say as I entirely disagree . You and I have made a mess of things . Yes , we did . Danko is working with Sylar . Sylar can change his shape . He can be anybody . He almost made me kill my wife . What was the last book you read ? Because I can 't remember . Not the last book I read , last movie I saw . Remember movie nights ? We used to rent old movies , make popcorn . When do we get to go back ? I don 't know . I miss it , too . You know , I should be a basket case . Digging up graves . I should be , but I 'm not . I 'm just not . I tried so hard to impress you , both of you . Becoming an agent , trying to stop the bad guys . What you did was very brave . I was an idiot . All I wanted to do was grow up . Honey , that 's all any teenager ever wants . You can 't fault yourself for that . Maybe not . Maybe I can . There was a time when I wanted to become a doctor , a chef , class president , not an agent . CHARLES : What are you waiting for ? Say your goodbyes , all right ? ANGELA : Are you sure ? Do we have to go right now ? CHARLES : Yeah . Linderman and Bobby , they 're already on the outside . We 're gotta go right now while they 're changing guards . It 's our best chance to sneak out , figure out where we are , how we can get help and save everyone . Look , this is your plan . I know . It 's just Alice ... She can 't come . It 's dangerous , she 'll slow us down . I promised her I 'd never leave her alone . I get it , but we need you to . So , keep her calm . Make sure she doesn 't blow this . How ? Lie . ( DOOR CLOSING ) What were you talking about ? ( SIGHING ) Me and the boys are gonna go sneak out tonight . Cool . I 'm coming , too . No . Why not ? Because you can 't , okay ? I just wanna hang out with kids my own age . Are you going to make out ? No . Don 't think like that . We 'll be back in a few . Cover for us . I 'm scared . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( SIGHS ) Listen . I had a dream last night , about you , and it 's going to be safe here . I swear . You just have to stay here . We 'll be right back . Now say good night , Alice . Good night , Alice . ( GASPS ) Alice ? Alice , look at me . Please , just turn around . Talk to me . ( ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING ) ( SIGHS ) The cops don 't believe me . Come on . We have to convince them , someone . This is serious , and you guys are acting like children . We 're enjoying the moment . Do you want a fry ? Come on . Let 's have a dance . You missed your prom , and you love this song . I never told you that . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) MAN : Hey . We don 't allow that in here . No dancing , not with a colored . We didn 't mean anything by it . Just pretend like this never happened . Your ability ? You don 't have to be afraid , Angela . Socks . We need to get socks . For Alice . MAN ON RADIO : This is the Emergency Broadcast Network . A severe storm warning is in effect . Flash floods and high winds have come out of nowhere . We have to get back to Alice . Now . ( ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING ) ( GASPS ) I 'm alive . You 're not going crazy . I almost didn 't recognize you . You look so old . Do I look old ? No . You look beautiful . Alice , how is this possible ? How ? Have you been here for 50 years ? When I found this place , it was packed with food . When I went through that , I did what I had to do . I stole what I needed . ( SIGHING ) Clothes , food . Stuff . Why did you stay ? You told me . Your dream . You said I 'd be safe if I stayed here . I ... And I trusted you . I thought I 'd be safe here and the world would be safe from me . From you ? Oh , Alice . The night I left , what happened that night , Alice ? When you left , that doctor , Suresh , he came for me . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) No . Alice . Stop . ( WIND HOWLING ) ( GROANS ) Alice ! Alice , wait ! Alice ! ( SCREAMS ) It 's okay . It 's okay , Alice . It 's okay . Alice . Sorry . ( GROANS ) ( GIRL SCREAMING ) GUARD : Get back inside , now ! ( GUNS FIRING ) ( GIRLS SCREAMING ) ( SOBBING ) You don 't have to stay here anymore . Let me help you . It 's time to go home . I have socks for you . Since that night , whenever I feel lost , whenever I don 't know what to do , I steal socks for you , to remind myself there are simple ways to protect the ones we love . You don 't ever have to be cold again . I am so sorry . Oh , Banana . It 's not your fault . Yes , it is . I lied to you . That night , I thought I was doing the right thing . I was trying to protect you . I was trying to save you . You ... I 'm so sorry . You . ( WIND HOWLING ) You . I 'm so sorry ! ( SCREAMING ) PETER : Mom ! Calm down . Alice , calm down ! Calm down . Calm down . ( YELLING ) ( SOBBING ) I have to talk to her . She 's gonna kill you . No . I have to talk to her . Alice ! Stop ! This isn 't their fault . This is your family . This is my son . He 's your nephew , Alice . You have a family , and they 're the only ones who can make everything all right . Don 't punish them for my mistakes . ( WIND CALMS ) I am so sorry . ( PANTING ) Come on . Let 's get out of here . Let 's go home . Say goodbye , Alice . No . ( EXCLAIMS ) ( SIGHS ) Alice is gone . She 's nowhere . Judging from her reaction , I think I know what my father was doing here . Your father . I found this in the lab . It may give you some answers about your father . I don 't know . Storm covered the graves . They 're all buried . Maybe it should remain that way . Fair enough . Let 's get out of here . I 'm not going with you , Peter . Why not ? Maybe you 're ready to move on , but I 'm not . I 'm not ready to forgive myself . Not yet . ( ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING ) ANGELA : We can never let this happen again . Not ever . No one can know about us . They already do . Not for long . I had a dream about the future . We 're going to form a group , a company that 's going to protect people like us . We 're just kids . Not anymore we 're not . What do we do in this dream ? Whatever we have to . They 're right to be afraid of us . The things we can do , the things we 're going to do to keep this secret safe , it 's a necessary evil . I 'm never going to see her again . You don 't know that . I get it , Mom . The guilt , the ... But you gotta let go of that . Come join us ? Come on . Okay . Please someone say something . How are the fries ? Look , this isn 't a company , this is a family . There 's a big difference . Families have the capacity for forgiveness . You mean that ? We 're stronger together than we are apart . Just no more hunting . We gotta make our existence secret . And try to put our lives back together . All right . So , what now ? I 'll go back to Washington , take ownership of my mistakes , talk to the President . ( MAN CHATTERING ON TV ) Looks like you already have . Bring real purpose back to the White House , and I promise you ... Who the hell is that ? ... that change will come to this country ... Sylar . ... and nothing will ever be the same . Thank you all very much . I 'll take a few questions . Elizabeth . Yes , sir , thank you . The American people are ...

Not without its charms . I could see making it a habit . So how , or why , did they put you in here ? I used to sleep in the nude , and get called away . And I woke up one too many times in family restaurants . At first , I didn 't tell the authorities that I was a traveler . Then I did once , and then I made the fatal mistake of insisting that I was , and here I am . So , the pills ... Do they help with the headaches ? - Headaches ? - Yeah.Before you travel . No . My hands go numb . Oh . I see . I figured out you 're here to help me . I mean , that 's what we do , right ? We bump everything back online . We first met at stanford when we were freshmen .

But , for now ... She 's just the love of my life . Doesn 't she know that you 're here ? Sadly , no . She , uh ... She has no idea . I mean , if she did , she 'd get me out of here . Why don 't you just , you know , travel out ? I would , but I think the sedatives are keeping me grounded . They watch you swallow them . So don 't pop any if you want to go home . Now , are you going to help me get out of here ? 'Cause I have a plan . I just need a partner . How long has he been gone ? All day , I think . It 's hard to tell . It 's not like he leaves on the 5 : 15 , you know ? I 'm sure he 's okay . Except there was blood on the floor , and the last time that happened , he left herewith a bullet in his shoulder . What else can we do , jack ? Can we get some answers some other way ? No , thanks . I was going through garrity 's file . There was a picture of dan as a kid with this guy elliot langley .

I used to feelso safe here . I know the guys who did security for our embassy in bahrain . Annette , you 're still here . Yes .

I went back and helped some guy escape from a mental institution . You put a mental patient on the streets . No . Unless you think people who say they can travel through time are crazy . You met a manwho said he travels ? Yeah . Well , I 'm sure he 's nuts , but then I thought you were . His name is evan . He 's desperate to meet this woman . He calls her the love of his life . - That 's all I got . - It 's too bad . Sure would be nice to have somebodyelse like you around . Well , there 's livia . Yeah . Somebody who 's a guy , and not really , really hot . Someone who 's been doing this for a while . Someone who couldgive you some insight . It 's not going to be evan . Why not ? 'Cause he 's dead .

Not yet . I take it you won 't make the wedding . Did you know that , um ... You and I were both born during a rare celestial occurrence ? Uh ... No . The joseph-lee comet . What do you think it means ? All right , now I think it means we 're both playing cupid , because another time traveler is about to enter that building . Hey , evan . Hey . Oh . You got out , too ! This feels like a bad idea . - What does ? - Talking to her . Really ? Who are you ? Uh ... She 's a friend . She 's one of us . You can tell by the shoes . Have you traveled since you got out ? No , no , but then again , I just escaped yesterday , so ... Lauren is married . - Evan , you left that part out . - I know .

Appears to be . The kid is dan vasser . My dad took the picture . You expect me to remember a picture with a stranger that 's 25 years old ? Are you going to cite me , inspector , or arrest me ? Because I am late for a lecture . We 're not done . Security detail 's heading for the car . Okay , let 's do it . Maybe you should lose the flowers . Why ? Women love flowers . It 's a little needy . Oh , I feel needy . - Hey . - One , one second ... Oh , my gosh . Mr. Vogel ? Yes . Alison willow . I 'm a law student at stanford . You spoke at my class awhile back . It was about municipal subsidies for water treatment . I just have a couple of quick questions . Do you mind ? She 's a voter . No . Go now . - Lauren . - Yes . Hi . Hi . My name is evan pattison . Have we met ? You could say that . Um , the first time we met was a long time ago in college at stanford . We used to , uh , study with the radio tuned to latin jazz .

Wedding anniversary . Okay , and the mayor story ? Have it for you in an hour . This is , uh , me and laurena few years back , dancing to " perfidia . " Happy New Year ! 2004 Salsa Competiton It 's her . I met her in college . I was married to her for 20 years . About 15 years back , the travels started . And I tried to live as normal a life as possible . What a joke . You 're one of us . I think I mentioned that . My god , what ... What causes it ? Why are we doing it ? I haven 't learned much since the first few months . Except that , uh ... Whoever 's pulling our strings is doing it for a reason . Dan , you 're going to change more lives than explorers , scientists , doctors , anyone . What happened to her , evan ? She was killed while we were married , back in ' 05 . Some guy that I pissed off back there . And I kept trying to fix it and it kept getting worse . So you erased your life with lauren on purpose ? I just happened to travel once back to the day I first met lauren in college . And so I changed it so that our paths never crossed . That 's all it takes , really . Just a little bump . And just like that , our lives as we knew it ... Deleted . I didn 't care that she wasn 't going to be mine , I just wanted her to live again . And now she has no memory of how happy we were . I just want one last moment with her . Hello . Hey , it 's me . Livia . Evan 's the real thing . Wow , okay . Well , you better get out of there . Why ? You are on your way up there . This is how I ended up in the cuckoo 's nest . My old self saw my new self and everything just unraveled from there . Glad you told me that now . Should we take the stairs ? Yeah . No . Dammit , I used to take the stairs to stay in shape , but not every time ... What are you hoping for , evan ? You already tried once , she didn 't remember you . No , I can 't accept that . How could she not remember me ? She loved me . - Because it never happened . - Yeah , it did happen . Look , I know it sounds nuts , but I just keep hoping that there 's some trace of us , of me . If I can just activate it . I kept one of her old rings as a keepsake . This doesn 't end well , evan . Officer Shoots Supevisor 's Stalker I don 't care . I don 't want to live past this day , anyway . Why ? Because this world makes no sense to me without her . He 's our mission . Getting him together with lauren is it . I don 't know , he 's way off mission and look at him . Are we doing the same by helping him ? Who are you calling ? - My contact at the mayor 's office . - Hello - Megan , this is dan vasser at the register . - Hi , Dan Yeah , I 'm looking for supervisor vogel 's schedule for the rest of the day .

We need to get him cleaned up . Do you have a plan ? Do we ever ? No , we wing it . Hold this for me . You should tell him what it is you do . I did . You think I 'd make that same mistake twice ? Is henry okay with that ? Wouldn 't you have been ? Yeah ... Yeah , I suppose I would have . Anything to keep you . Campaigning is 24 / 7 . I need you on weekends .

If you do , I 'll vote for your husband . I pegged youas smarter than that . This song . " Perfidia . " Just follow my lead , okay ? Okay . You were warned . It 's okay . I didn 't know I could do this . It must be you . You 're a natural we need a doctor ! He 's got no pulse ! Maybe this is supposed to be evan 's day to die , no matter what we do . Yeah , I guess . Just when we thought there were more of us . Well ... One of us has to be leaving soon . Yeah , you think ? I don 't know why , but ... I think it 's going to be awhile . I was thinking the same thing . Holy ... I remember , this is the first moment that I traveled . Right when evan died . I can give you a ride to the airport . I like the limo . Uh-huh , cause you can drink dewars in the back seat . Well , there 's a bar and a driver , katie . I seize opportunity . I owe josh a call . Can I tell him that you 're considering the house ? I 'd like to think about it overnight . I don 't mean to exclude dan , it 's just that he 's not my responsibility . You and zack , you 're my responsibility . No , we 're not . And I 'm raising my son not to head for the hills at the first sign of a problem . First sign of a problem ? The first sign of a problem was months ago . Dan 's not crazy . Walks like a duck ... Leave now . And finally , a san francisco power couple is no more . Earlier today , supervisor vogel and his wife lauren announced they are splitting up . Hello , dan . Now you know me . You met evan pattison . You knew him ? I knew of him . And you know what I do and what he did ? I have my suspicions , yes . Did he have to diefor me to start ? What is happening to me ? How did democritus discoveratomic structure half a millennium beforethe atom was even conceived ? How did the incas build perfect clay replicas of airplanes in 500 A. D. ? These temporal anomalies in the historical record needed explanation , so the thurn-tippet group obtained a grant ... To find time travelers . To find anomalies and try to account for them . And that 's how we discovered a very select cadre of people . That do what ? What have you been doing for the last six months ? Changing realities . You have an incredible gift , and that 's why I 've kept my distance recently . I don 't understand . When anyone , especially people you love , know the truth about you , it puts them at risk . Imagine having the ability to manipulate a time traveler . Imagine what some would do to get that ability , which is why I will neveradmit to anyone that I know anything about you . It 's more dangerous than you can ever imagine , and people are watching me . Who 's watching ? Who is doing this to me ? As far as I can tell , no one is doing anything . There are others like me , I know that much . The numbers appear to be dwindling . The system seems to be breaking down . You are the last one . No ... You 're wrong . There 's one more . Really ? Who ? I wish I could talk about it . Wise man . Go get ready for bed . Okay . Hey , come here . Do you know how much I love you ? - Yes . - How much ? To the moon and back . Hey . I 'm sorry I didn 't get a chance to say good-bye to annette . Yeah , I know . It 's usually your favorite part of her visit . What is that ? Evan 's notebook . I 'm thinking about starting one myself . Are you saying ... ? He wasn 't crazy , no . Not entirely anyway . - He 's like you . - Yeah . Did you talk to him ? What 'd he say ? I didn 't get as much time as I 'd like , but he 'd been doing itfor 15 years , all the while happily married . - So he was married ? - Yeah . And he stopped the traveling ? I suppose . You know what this means ? The sedatives . Dan , we can stop this . I 'm , I 'm gonna call dr . Pullen tomorrow . We can get a prescription and ... It 's what you want , right ? Katie , the more I find out about this , the more I realize it 's not a curse . It 's a calling . I 'm doing something important , maybe even vital , and I don 't think I should stop it . What about getting things back to the way they were ? Things aren 't going back to the way they were ever , I 'm afraid . I worry for you and I worry for zack . And I would ... I 'd understand if ... It became too much for you to bear . And you 'd be only human if you were thinking the same thing . You said something ... That first night when you dug up the patio . Yeah . You said you 'd always come home . I did . Where do we stand on that ? You still mean it ? Yes . Then I 'll leave a light on .

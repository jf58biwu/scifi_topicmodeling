 This dam project will create many new jobs . The Party and country will assist in your relocation . Grandma , give me your hand . - But where are they taking us ? - It 'll be all right . Brother ! Grandma , I will send you money . Who can write ? Who can read ? Who can weld ? I put a lot of faith into your organization . It 's a perfect replica , Roland . There are too many fanatics out there that could damage her . Just think about the beautiful Buddha statues they blew up in Afghanistan . Our Heritage Organization has already made selections from the British Museum and L 'Hermitage . I guess she 'll be safe now , tucked away hidden in some bunker in Switzerland . Perfectly safe , Roland . Only infrared analysis would reveal the difference . But it 's still a fake . Hello ? Laura . Laura , can you hear me ? Roland , is that you ? Laura , they lied to us . I 've arranged a press conference for tomorrow . I will tell everyone the truth about what 's going on . What are you talking about ? The art you collected it 's not in the Alps . Those tunnels are empty . I have proof ! Laura . Laura , can you hear me ? - I 'm losing you . Roland ? - Laura , can you hear me ? Laura . I feared you would not come . Zultan , listen to me we are fighters , we never go down no matter how hard they hit us . Kill the bastard . Kill the bastard , Zultan . Yuri , where are you going ? Yuri ? Do not believe in something simply because you have heard it , Nima . But , great Lama , Tenzin is my brother . He works inside the big tunnel , where the ships are built . But what is there in your wisdom , great Lama , if Tenzin is right ? What if our world is indeed coming to an end ? It is full , great Rinpoche . Like this cup you are full of opinions and speculations . To see the light of wisdom you first must empty your cup . Be careful with the clutch . it tends to slip . - Grandma . - Grandpa , Nima is here ! Grandma , I got a message from Tenzin . He wants us to meet him in Cho Ming at the west gate . He says he can get us on the ships he 's working on . What are you talking about ? Tenzin works on the dam . Grandma the dam is a ship ! The government lied to us . There will be a big flood ! We must pack up right away . Nima , he gave you the truck ? We took a trip on the Laem Song ferry once . Grandpa threw up the whole way . Let 's eat first . Who are they ? We found them along side of the road . Send them back ! I am a follower of our great Lama Rinpoche . You know I cannot do that . We are all children of the earth . My plan will not work for so many , Grandma . We will take them all . We have to hurry ! They are leaving ! Tenzin wait ! Grandma , we 're almost there . Daddy look ! Tenzin , almost there . Nima , what happened ? Grandma , Grandpa . I 'm sorry . - I could not save us . - He has gone back in . He will fix it . There 's no way . Don 't lose your faith , brother .

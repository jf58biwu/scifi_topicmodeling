I 'm just having a discussion , but that 's why i hate having it here , because , when it is ... You 're tempted to spend it . That and people could find it . Like seven-year-old boys who aren 't very good at keeping secrets . He shouldn 't need to keep secrets . That 's why i 'm getting rid of it in the past .

Michael kowalchuk , age 17 , steals a car , leads police on a three-hour chase . This was in ' 89 . I wrote it up as a human interest piece . Now , his father was an immigrant , owned his own garage . Used to smack the kids around . - Old school . - Yeah . Too bad siberia wasn 't available . Judge gave the kid three years in juvie , but ... Considering his old man , i think that jail might 've been a better deal . Anything else ? I never did a followup , but you might want to check california correctional . Repeat offender profile ? Yeah . So you had another thing , a letter combination ? Yeah . G-f-n-g and an " o . " " o " with a diagonal line through it . No . Nothing on that one . Could be a gang tag . Maybe you could talk to a street source , someone who knows gangs . I 'll do that . Hey , question . Sure . Did elliott langley stop by last week , a scientist ? Yeah . Why ? What did he want ? Why do you want to know ? All right , he was ... Helping me with my book . Oh , so now you 're working on your book on my dime ? He dropped in unannounced . He stayed for ten minutes . You know elliott langley ? I knew that he was a scientist , had some oddball ideas ... And he worked at , uh , thurn-tippett before he went to livermore . Your book- - it 's not going to be about that serial bomber a couple years ago , is it ? Serial bomber ? Never mind . Hey , maybe between chapters for your book , a news item for the paper . Uh , how about a coming-of-age story ? Car thief tries to turn his life around ? Sounds breathtakingly dull . I didn 't say that it ended well . Good . Hey , come here . Run , run ! Run . Hey , hey ! Whoa , whoa ! Back off ! I got a knife . Why , you forget your keys ? I told you this was a stupid idea . You 're a lousy lookout . I didn 't want to be a lookout . I didn 't want to do any of this . Hey . He 's that guy . He saved you when the rocket blew up . I live around here . Come on . Let 's get you home . No ! Don 't . My dad will kill hi - , Please . He says michael 's useless . He didn 't ask , motormouth . He says you can 't raise a teenager in america .

You 're not useless . There 's gotta be something you 're good at . cars . Fixing them or stealing them ? There 's a ' 69 chevy a guy 's getting ready to sell . My dad can 't fix it , but mike can . Mike 's really good . Shut up ! It 's a camaro . Pebble beige . For how much ? The guys says he 'll sell it for 200 bucks . Oh , yeah ? Buy it for me . Whoa . Here 's an extra $ 300 . Get it back to cherry . In a year , if you 're as good as he says , i 'll pay you $ 3,000 for it . If not , or if you don 't see me again ... What ? Well ... You can keep it . Who are you ? Uh . You ... Better get outta here . Go . Go . what are you doing ? My brother 's . Really ? Candy-apple red . There 's that radar detector he tried to hide under the dash . You remember it ? He still owns it , what , 20 years from now ? It 's my old neighborhood . I grew up here . Feels like you 're off course . Why ? 'Cause i 'm here . What 's doing this to us , livia ? I don 't know . I just go with it now and try to adapt . Well , i want to know . I want answers . How you doing about gathering stuff ? I 've got a cell that works from ' 95 on . Still working on old ids . How about relevant currency ? That , that is not a problem . Come on ! Come on . - Wait . - Come on , danny . Is that ... ? Yeah , that 's my brother . Come on , danny . That 's ... Oh , my god . that 's you . Get in the car , danny . It 's stupid to be out this late . Mom 's worried . So what ? Don 't be such a ... You shouldn 't have sold dad 's cameras . That 's what 's been bugging you ? What are you looking at ? Is that a problem ? Come on . He 's supercop always . Is this how you want to spend the rest of you life , playing donkey kong or frogger ? Exterminator . - Danny . - What ? He 's not coming back , okay ? Dad 's not coming home . Come on . I want to go home . Can i drive ? What do you think ? He never let me drive . dan ? Yeah ? hey , we have a little problem . What 's wrong ? They put a hold on our credit cards . I mean , i called and it 's all cleared up , but ... What happened ? The sfpd asked to examine all our recent transactions . They 're looking for cash withdrawals . But why ? Isn 't it obvious ? Jack 's tracking our money . Hey , jack ? Hey . So , what do you think you 're doing ? I was trying to get this thing running again , but they stopped making the ignition barrel so some guy could charge me 500 bucks for it on ebay . What are you doing , putting a hold on our cards ? I didn 't . It was the bank . I just asked some questions . You cnow , if they got a little nervous ... - How many ways can we say it ? - You 're betting again . I see it . the running away , the lying . You think that gives you the right ... Until i get the truth , i 'm asking questions . - Before somebody else does . - u can 't stop being a cop , Yo can you , jack , even when it comes to your own family ? I see what it 's doing to katie . Don 't you talk about katie . She 's my wife . You guys say you 're going through some sort of family crisis . I 'm supposed to trust you ? Well , you 've given me no reason to . When i 'm ready to talk about this , i will . But i 'm not ready to tell you , and jack , you 're not ready to hear it . I told him to back off . And that 's gonna do it ? The card thing 's temporary . Once he figures out there 's nothing wrong , then ... He wont back off , dan . I know him . I 'm fine keeping jack at a distance . I prefer it . He 's concerned . I mean , in a lot of ways , he 's justified . Not that i 'm taking his side . I 'm not . Sweetie , there 's something else we should probably talk about . Can something wait ? We need to talk . Okay , i 'll call you back , all right ? - In my office now . - Sure . Nancy said you 've been asking about some initials . Yeah . Want to tell me who your source is on this ? Not yet . There was that package bomb , killed a chemical engineer and a research assistant about seven years ago . The east bay petrol company . This is privileged information , you understand ? The cops told us don 't show it to anyone . About a week before it happened , we got a letter , a manifesto blaming the petrochemical industry for everything wrong with the world . The writer demanded that we print it on the front page or else . And you didn 't print it . Dan , if we printed every threatening letter we got ... That was the first in a spree of bombings . The guy was never caught . Even threatened your buddy , elliott langley when he was at thurn-tippett . " global freedom now group zero . " thanks , hugh . This gonna be another dead-end story ? What do you mean ? I mean , the last time ... You said you had a lead on dylan mccleen and what happened to his missing hundred grand . - Hugh , i ... - " dry hole " is how you put it . Now you 're telling me you 've got this guy 's identity . Well , i can 't be sure . Well , be sure ! I got it . - May i take this ? - Yeah . Just don 't let it out of your sight . And dan ? Yeah ? This time tomorrow i want to hear you 've got a story that does pan out . right . You need to find michael kowalchuk ? ? Excuse me . I 'm looking for dan vasser . His desk is right over there . Michael kowalchuk ? Thanks for coming down . Hey . I wanted to thank you in person and show you the camaro . Still have it . That 's great . I 'll come down and take a look . You , you look the same . Clean living . Come on . So , your brother- - it 's two times i 've met him now and both times he 's running off someplace , no explanation . What about it ? Well , it 's nothing . I don 't mean to make a big deal . It 's just that in the er when we see a guy like that ... Like what ? You know ... Nervous , won 't give you a straight answer , won 't look you in the eye ... You don 't have to tell me what 's wrong with dan . I got a pretty good idea . I didn 't mean to ... Yeah . So that 's it ? Okay , thanks . Look , if you need to deal with that ... I should really . It 's just this thing with my brother . It 's okay . Jack , is this thing between you and dan ... Don 't worry about it . I 'm not . I 'm just wondering . It ... Is this thing between you and him or is this thing between you and his wife ? Katie ? It 's just something i noticed . A girl has to ask . I 'll call you later . i don 't know what else i can tell you . Dad died a few months after i saw you . I had to take over the business . So you 're still ... Yeah , keeping it in the family . If you would have told me back then , i 'd wind up running a garage ... Things didn 't turn out the way that you planned . Yeah , i guess . Michael , uh , do you blame anyone ? Blame ? Your life didn 't go the way you wanted . That could make you angry . * * Make you want to get back at someone . I didn 't say i was angry . My wife . You 're married . Yeah . I got two little ones , annette and greg . Want to see their pictures ? Sure . So you 'd say you were happy . Sure . I mean , it was tough there for a while , supporting a family ... And a brother . Your brother steven ? Yeah . So what happened to steven ? Look , uh , i have taken up enough of your time . I don 't get exactly ... What happened to steven , michael ? He ... Developed problems . Emotional ones . I mean , he was off-the-charts smart , you know ? He was getting his phd in mathematics at stanford . He just couldn 't finish the program . Where is he now ? We lost touch . He 'd still write to me sometimes . Long letters . And crazy stuff in them . Wh-why did you want to talk to me ? What is " gfng0 , " michael ? It 's a thing ... My father used to call us . " good-for-no-good-nothings . " steven- - he used ... He used to make an abbreviation out of it as a joke . So do you know where he lives ? No . Like i said , we lost touch . Look , is there something you 're not telling me ? is there something you 're not telling me , michael ? do you really not know where he is , or what happened to him ? I think i 'm going to go . Thanks for coming . Yeah . Listen , if you do know something ... Hello ! What day is it ? I don 't know . I just got here . You want a new travel tip ? Registration tags . It 's 1965 . Oh , yeah ? Kid 's on a cell phone . Okay , so it 's not a perfect system . Excuse me . Is michael kowalchuk around ? He 's delivering a vehicle . You need something ? Yeah . The time . Five to 8 : 00 . And the date ? Uh ... April 12 . Yeah , the 12th , i think . 2000 ? Yeah . Two people are going to die from a mail bomb in about 30 minutes . You know who did it ? Michael kowalchuk 's brother . I think he knows where he is . Do you know where this bomb is going to blow up ? On the peninsula . We need to call the police . You call the police about a bomb threat , they 'll trace that number and start asking questions . Then everything unravels , dan . Then i need a car . How ? Who 's going to drive you ? It 's okay . It 's okay . I know where i can steal one . Wait . I know where we are . Are you going to steal jack 's car ? If he 's still living where i think he 's living . And there she is . He looked after it like it was his own baby . I remember he left a spare here once . One of those magnet things ? That 's kind of dumb for a cop . We were all dumb once . Here 's hoping this is his time . It 's not here . What are you doing ? You know why i still wear hairpins ? It 's called being prepared . It actually works if you ... You gonna tell me where you learned that ? No . This is some kind of teen fantasy for you , isn 't it ? No , but yeah . Do you know where this is gonna happen ? Yeah . The , uh ... East bay petrol labs , off of mission , south of 280 , in about 15 minutes . You know you 're never going to make it . I 'm in a bright red car that i stole from a cop . What makes you say that ? Better go the speed limit . Yeah . Cynthia mcnaughton ! Cynthia mcnaughton ! Yes ? Please stand up ! Please stand up right now ! You have to get out of here , all of you . I 'm sorry ? Albert voss ? It 's all right . I ... Don 't ask me how i know , but this is a bomb . Please , everybody keep moving . Everybody keep togetúer . Please , this way . How do you know about this ? I overheard someone in a bar . It 's probably a hoax . The police are going to want to talk to you . Wait . Where are you going ? Okay . Katie barron vasser . Audition tape for kryl , channel 6 news . Should it be katie barron ? Hi . You may remember me as katie barron , reporter for action ... For ... Anyway , so here 's where i tell a little bit about who i am and what i 've done . I won a local emmy for covering city hall . My husband 's a time traveler , but i can 't tell anyone . Okay . Cut . Erase that . The door was open . How long have you been there ? Dan 's not at work . He 's not here . Where is he ? What did you two ... We had a bad one today . You gonna tell me you don 't know ? I don 't . Don 't lie to me . He 's up to his old tricks . You know . I know it . He 's not . Jack , you can 't just come in here ... So you 'd tell me if he 's spending cash that he can 't account for , right ? If he 's suddenly broke ? Or flush ? Why ? Because it 's worse than it was before , and that was bad . I care about him . And i care about you . Okay . You making movies ? I 'm thinking about going back to work . That 's not a bad idea . Sorry to bother you . Here at the headquarters of the east bay petrol corporation where the package was delivered this morning . Thanks to an anonymous tipster , there are no fatalities , but damage is reported to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars . * * You think my brother did that ? You tell me . What are you , the fbi ? No . Then get the hell out of here . What proof do you have ? None . But you know that he 's capable of doing something like this . That he 's angry and he 's brilliant . That he had an abusive father who didn 't appreciate either one of his kids . There 's a lot of men like that in this town . A smaller percentage of them like to blow things up . You can 't expect me to turn my own brother in . I 'm not asking you to . Just tell me where he is . Two people almost died , michael . More are going to die . You want him to spend the rest of his life in prison ? I 'm his older brother . And i was never there for him . But he always ... He adways worried about me . Then pay him back , michael . Be there for him now . Keep on driving it that way , you 're gonna do some damage . The key doesn 't work . I might be able to help you with that . Steven , open the door ! It 's michael ! Steven , open up ! Steven , it 's me . Michael . I brought someone here . He remembers you . Don 't be afraid , steven . I 'm a friend . You 're back . I knew you 'd come back . You did ? The godel metric has been disproved , but there 's still the possibility with tachyons . Tachyons ? Yeah . You know what tachyons are ? Yeah . They 're particles that travel faster than the speed of light . Traversals through higher-dimensional space . Steven . Remember , mike , when we were building the rocket , we needed it to go higher and faster ? We needed tachyons . He gets like this . He needs to take medication . Don 't you get it ? He doesn 't age . Steven ... Are you from the future or the past ? are you from the future or the past ? The future . I knew it . It 's the shoes . It 's always the shoes . Yes , steven , he 's come ... To give you a message . Don 't be afraid of the future , steven . The science , technology , things changing so fast . Some of it- - it 's kind of cool . And some things don 't change . Like what ? Well ... Love . Love 's a constant . Michael ... Michael 's here out of love , steven . He 's ... He 's here for you . Steven , what do you say ? Do you feel like getting out of here ? Come on . Good luck . * * So , are we done ? Isn 't jack going to notice that 's missing ? Hold on . Is that jack ? Yeah . Who is he with ? Katie . Wait a minute . This is 2000 . Weren 't ... Weren 't you guys married ? Not yet . But we were about to be . Word of advice : don 't . * * It 's probably nothing . I bet they just talked . I 'd have remembered . Just come on up and i 'll call you a cab . I 'm sorry , i ... I just need to ... I need to sit down for a second . Okay . You know , he 's probably home already . He could be there now . Maybe . Look , i don 't know what to tell you , okay ? He 's my brother . I like to think he 's improving . How ? He tells me to go to hell a lot more . Shows emotional growth . Is there something else ? No . Kate , i know when something 's bothering you , because you say nothing 's bothering you . Dan asked me to marry him . Wow . When did he ... When i ... Told him that i was pregnant . I said yes . Wow . Are you sure you 're pregnant ? Because we had that scare ... I 'm sure . I 'm really sorry i have to tell you . No , please , i asked . Note to self , though , it 's a bad idea . Jack , it 's just all moving so fast . Katie ... i mean he lost livia only a year and a half ago , and then there 's you and me . Katie . What ? Do you love him ? I don 't know . I think so . Well , he loves you . He wouldn 't have asked you to marry him if he didn 't . I know that guy a little . And whatever happens , you can come to me if you need someone to straighten him out . Thank you . Yeah . We should probably get you home . Hey ... Thanks a lot . There 's got to be some cabs out there somewhere . Jack was always looking out for you . Yeah , i know . Hey , katie loves you , dan . She 's just unsure . You guys got slammed with a lot of stuff back then . Maybe . i want to just talk to him in person . where is he ? out . What do you want this time , jack , dna , fingerprints ? i 'd say you 're upset . A little , yeah . Hey , babe . Hey , so what 's he doing here ? " he ? " yeah . He came by to tell you something . Your credit statements check out . I also called an officer at your bank about your cash accounts , and there 's no unusual movement of funds . I was way out of line . I 'm sorry . Hey , jack ... I think that 's the part you 're looking for . Where 'd you get this ? I got a friend , owns a garage . We go way back . Thank you . All right . See you guys . See you later . See you . See you . If you could do it over again , would you ? You mean ... Us . Yeah . Of course . Then you may be the crazy one . thanks for coming to see me . i only have a couple of minutes . Oh , we 're good . Thank you . I ... I 'm still on parole . I know . In the care of your brother ? Yes . He says he owes you . No , no , he doesn 't . Well , maybe a free tune-up . You wanted to talk ? Yes . Um ... The article that i 'm writing , it 's not just about your recovery . It 's about the work you were doing in menlo park regarding ... Anomalies- - space-time journeys through higher dimension ... It 's not possible . I 'm sorry ? Time travel . I 've done some more work since then none of it published , of course , but then it ... It proved time travel can 't happen . Not even if we posit the existence of tachyons . I see . What , and the research you were doing- - have you ever crossed paths with an elliott langley ? No . You wrote letters to him , claming that his research lead to global ... Those were not my best days , mr.Vasser , and i 'm not the same person- - thanks to you . Yeah . I 'm sorry to disappoint . All right . And you gave me too much credit . Your brother deserves most of it . Yes , he does . Well , thank you again . Take care . I like your shoes . Oh , thanks . I know what you 're going to say . You do ? The guy who bombed the east bay petrol lab . You want to know where i am on the story . What are you talking about ? The letter , remember ? Sent to the paper ? A bomb threat ? This was about seven years ago . Vaguely . Guy turned himself in , right ? Right . Steven kowalchuk . So why 's this a story ? It 's not . I mean , that 's what i was going to tell you . Okay , um , you know what i was gonna say is you can give katie a message . Grant hauser at channel 6 is going to give her serious consideration . What ? You and your wife need to talk more . You ready ? Yeah . You parked at a bus stop ? Yeah , who 's gonna give me a ticket ? Are you sure about this ? Yeah . You drive . Okay . okay , now don 't go crazy . She 's not all she used to be . Yeah , yeah , i know . Seriously . I know , i know .

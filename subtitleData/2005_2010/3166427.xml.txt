 Take a sample of her blood then get rid of her . Yes , sir . Subtitle by Darkopal The Umbrella Corporation thought they contained the infection . They were wrong . Racoon City was just the beginning . Within weeks , the T-Virus had consumed the United States . Within months , the world . The virus didn 't just wiped out human life . Lakes and rivers dried out . Forests became deserts and whole continents were reduced to nothing more than baren wastelands . Slowly but surely the Earth began to wither and die . But a few survivors that were , learnt to keep on the move . We avoided major cities . If we stopped in a place too long , they would be drawn to us . Only a few at first but then more and more never ending army of undead . For those of us left , staying on the road , seemed the only way to stay alive . This is KLKB . We have 7 people here in need of urgent medical attention . We need help . This is KLKB . Can anyone hear us ? Can anyone help us ? Please ? My baby . Please ! Please help my baby ! You bitch ! You dropped my baby . We 're surrounded . We need help . Can anyone hear us ? Can anyone help us ? Please ! We 're saved now , mama . Let 's see . What else she has back there ? What you got down there , missy ? I wouldn 't do that ! Shut your mouth ! Hold her legs ! Just shot the bitch ! Eddie , Eddie ! Eddie ! Jesus Christ , he 's dead . You 're pretty smart , huh ? We will see . There you go , bitch ! I don 't wanna to be over too fast ! Open the cage ! Let them loose . Back ! That ? No , no , no ! That was a juicy one , huh ? Hey Carlos , this is Claire . You got any smokes ? No ! Like I 'm supposed to believe that . Claire , would I lie to you ? L.J. ? Claire Redfield , how can I help you ? Got any smokes ? No , candour . Have an alternate ? Sorry to say we 're out of that , too . You gotta be shitting me ? Sorry campus , smoked the last two back in Salt Lake . Damn ! Yeah , people . Damn it ! We 're really in the end of the world . Anyone else ? Paris facility . Food supplies downed to 50 % . 6 casualties . Biohazard numbers increasing . London facility . Food supplies downed to 28 % . 17 casualties . Biohazard numbers increasing . Gentlemen ! Dr. Isaacs . How good of the science division to join us . Chairman Wesker . I 've been busy . On the subject of the biohazards , what does the science division have to report ? Well , we know now conclusively that they have no real need for sustenance . They hunger for flesh , but do not require it . My research indicates , they could remain active for decades . We 'll be trapped underground for decades ? What news of project Alice ? Using antibodies from her blood I will develop a serum that will not just combat the effects of the T-Virus , but potentially reverse it . Giving back these creatures a measure of their intelligence . Their memories . Thus curving down their hunger for flesh . You 're confident you can domesticate them ? They are animals essentially . We can train them if we can take away their basic instincts . They 'll never be human but would provide the basis for a docile work force . We can return to the surface . After months of experiments , you have nothing to show . And we are left over underground . Without the original Project Alice , progress has been difficult . I 've been forced to replicate using clone genetic models . It 's laborius . The results unpredictable . Project Alice and the subject of domestication is of the highest priority . You 'll concentrate on this to the exclusion all other research . We 'll expect an updated report within a week . Simply demanding results will not guaranteed . Then perhaps we should get someone else in charge . Someone who can give us the reassurances as we required . Continue with your research , Doctor , while it is still your research . This meeting is adjourned . Sorry about this , Stevie ! This is Claire Redfield 's convoy . Broadcasting for any survivors . Is anybody out there ? Broadcasting for any survivors . Is anybody out there ? This is Claire Redfield 's convoy . Broadcasting for any survivors . Is anybody out there ? This is Claire Redfield 's convoy , present location is the Desert Trout Motel . Broadcasting for any survivors . Is anybody in there ? Broadcasting for any survivors . Is anybody in there ? Keep trying , Mikey . Seems quiet . Yeah , don 't they always ? Is there anyone alive in there ? Please , respond . Claire , it looks clear . So we 're going ? It 's your call , boys . - Come on , let 's go ! - Let 's do it . I 'm giving me a room I 'll take a water bed and jacuzzi . Then I 'm gonna rent me a porno . What happened ? You two OK ? Yeah , it 's all clear . Somebody need my help ? It 's nothing , but if you insist ... That 's right . So sit back and relax . Spread out , look for anything of use . Gas , food , ammo . You know the drill . - You like playing rough , huh ? - Oh , I 've had worse . I 'm sure . But you 've always been gentle with me , baby . Oh , God ! I 'm leaving . So , what do you say , a dinner at my place , tonight ? Oh , I 'm there . Hey , Betty ! Over here ! This is amazing . He knows what it is . Camera . You try . Stand your ground . - My God ! - Unbelievable ! - He has memory and reasoning skills . - This is incredible ! The serum works . You 've domesticated them . You 've done it . Congratulations ! Open the door ! No ! Please ! No ! Dr. Isaacs , please , no ! No ! - Pork and beans . - I 'll get some peaches over there ! It 's suspense ! You . Cat food . Just kidding . It 's pork and beans . Hey ! It said so , soup . Cream of mushrooms . - Bullshit . - Pork and beans , too . I 'll be dammed ! How do you do that ? Just one of my skills . It 's a dying art , unfortunatelly . This is , ah ... This is the last one . It 's some kind of fruit . Sorry that . Have you checked the gas station yet ? Yeah , it 's bone dry . How are we looking here ? Well , Claire , if we can run these trucks on rust , we 're looking pretty good . All right ! Hey , sweetheart ! - Perimeter up yet ? - It 's almost done . - Who 's out there ? - Olivera . Hey , Carlos ! Claire ? All that smoking will slow you down . Bring your ass here , old man . I want my perimeter up . Last sentinel in place . Perimeter is up and running . All motion sensors online . Cameras 100 % . - Refried beans , fruit salad . - All my favourite . Storm 's coming . Let 's start packing it up and move inside . - Ok , let 's go ! - Hurry up ! Get on the bus . Put this fire out . This is Claire Redfield 's convoy . Present location the Desert Trout Motel . Band 35-1-1 . Calling for any survivors . This is Claire Redfield 's convoy . Present location the Desert Trout Motel . Band 35-1-1 . Calling for any survivors . Activate number 87 . Shit ! Dr. Isaacs ! What is it ? My sensors have detected a peak in psy-organic activity . Both alpha and beta waves . - From number 87 ? - No . The activity is not from one of the clones . It occured outside the complex . - It 's not possible . - My sensors were quite clear . Massive psy-organic activity was detected 15 minutes ago . Sended on a desert location . - Claire ! - What ? What the hell ? Oh , God ! Carlos ! I see them . Everybody , stay in your trucks . What is going on ? Everyone , stay in your trucks . Roll up the windows and keep quiet . Ok , close the windows up . What 's wrong with their eyes ? They 're feeding on infected flesh . Fire it up , let 's get out of here . Yeah , that 's a hell of an idea . Lock and load . We stucked . Oh , hell , no . Let 's get out of here . Let 's get on the bus , come on . Go ! Go ! Get in ! Get in ! Come on , come on , come on ! Claire ! Damn it ! Mikey , Carlos , we have to evacuate the bus . You got it . - Come on ! Go ! - Keep moving ! Hurry up ! Come on ! Go , Go , Go ! Come on ! - Betty ! - L.J. , go ! Get out of here Betty , go ! Move , move , move ! Betty ! Betty ! L.J. , hurry up ! Come here , baby ! Come on , come on ! Betty ! Betty ! No ! Betty ! Go , go , go ! Dr. Isaacs . Another spike of alfa and beta waves detected . 45 % probability that this is Project Alice . Triangulate , find her location . Impressive ! If it is her , her development is extraordinary . Her powers would appear to have grown in a geometric rate since her escape from the D-Tork facility . You 've made 10 trips to the surface in the last 24 hours . All unauthorized . Any trips to the surface , especially to gather fresh specimen , puts my men at risk . Why do you need them all of a sudden ? Isaacs ! My research has intensified . Don 't worry , they 're perfectly secured . You 're supposed to be domesticating them . Sometimes aggression has it 's uses . What could you possibly need these things for ? Dr. Isaacs ! Specimen 87 has reached the final state of the test grid . Perfect , put her on the screen . Good girl . Is chairman was curious why we 've this ? He knows what he needs to know . You 've overstepped your mark . My research will change the face of everything . If you picked a side you sure it 's the right one . Hi ! Hey ! This belongs to you ? Gave it to you last night . For luck . Thank you . - What 's your name ? - K-Mart . It 's where they found me . Claire and the others . A few years back . You have another name ? Never liked it . And everyone I knew is dead , so seemed like time for a change . Anyone wanna say something ? Alice , this is Claire Redfield . She 's the one that put this convoy together . Thank you so much for your help . Claire ! Excuse me , I 've things I have to intend to . Last six months she lost half of the convoy . Pretty soon there 'll be more of us dead than alive . Alice , what happened to you ? Why did you leave after D-Troy ? I didn 't have a choice . They were using me . - What do you mean ? - They were tracking me . I couldn 't be around you , any of you . I 'd have got you all killed . That 's why you disappeared ? Broke into an Umbrella facility and hacked into their computers . Downloaded satellite trajectories . Stayed off the grid . After the world ended , why stay out on your own ? It 's safer , if I 'm not around people . But you 've come back . Damn ! What time is it ? Chase ! What time is it ? Well , Carlos , it is 12 : 14 . Why , you got somewhere you 've gotta be ? Guess I 'm just being paranoid . Welcome home . Got a minute ? Yeah . Everyone is grateful to you for helping us out . How long am I gonna stay ? Don 't get me wrong . We really are grateful . They 're all talking about what you did and they 're scared . - I don 't blame them . People have a hammered getting around me . Not just you . You 're positive it 's her ? 62 % , to great a chance to pass up . If it is Project Alice , she 's been evading the satellite grid for years . I 've rerouted the remaining satellites we can reaquire the subject and she 'll be unaware of our surveillance . I can have an strike team ready within the hour . No , we 'll establish a positive identification first . 100 % The group she 's with include known associates . The original Project Alice is vital to my research to the whole process of domestication her blood . Her genetic structure is the key . The longer we leave her out there the greater the chance we lose her again . - I can 't risk that . - That decision isn 't yours to make . You 'll take no action until this matter has been discussed by the committee at the next scheduled meeting . And Doctor ! That 's an order ! Claire , these sequence of tranmissions . It 's the best indication of what we 've seen in six months . - Alaska ? We have to check it out . We can 't just ignore it . Have you any idea what kind of journey that would be ? - Yeah , a long one . - And at the end of it , what ? You have no guarantee there is even anyone alive up there . - Claire , these transmissions say ... - They 're dated six months ago . How many radio broadcasts have we responded to ? How many times have we got there too late ? The transmissions say there is no infection up there . It 's isolated and safe . This convoy trust me with their lives . These people don 't need pipe dreams . Maybe that 's exactly what they need . Look at them , Claire . Six months ago , there were 50 of us then 40 . Now there is less than 30 . We 're starting to give up . They need ... They need somekind of hope . We have a decision to make . And it 's too big ! It 's too important for me to make it for you . There is a change there are survivors . In Alaska . There is a chance that the infection hasn 't reached that far . But we don 't know for sure . So we have a choice . We stay as we are or we travel to Alaska . For Alaska ? Alaska . I hope you 're right . God ! The food is virtually gone and trucks are running on empty . I 've got half a tank of gas . That 's it . Chase ? Shit , I don 't even have empty . I have enough for 100 miles , tops . All right , if we gonna make this trip , we gonna need to resupply . Yeah ! These are our options . The nearest safest bet is , right there . No , it 's empty , I tried there . Then we 'll , maybe ... - We could try this . - Vegas . At least that sure we find gasoline and supplies . Well , there is a reason for that . Vegas is too damn dangerous . Yeah , that place is going to be crawling with the sons of bitches . We 've trained every small town driven last 6 months . We have to get the big city . She is right . Vegas is our only bet . We 'll establish a positive identification first . One hundred percent . You 'll take no action until this matter has been discussed by the committee at the next scheduled meeting . Doctor ! That 's an order . The Committee authorizes immediate action . Release of vehicles and personnel under command of Dr. Isaacs . That 's an order . Hey , are you all right ? Yeah , I am fine . Pork and beans , man . They leak all see I , you cowboys do it . Years of practice . Oh , my God ! What happened to it ? The desert must have taken it back . Five years . No one here to keep sand back . It 's empty . No undead , nothing . Those birds must 've move over the city block by block . Picked it clean . I don 't see any truck stops . Where are they ? There , lower parking at the casino up ahead . There 's gas pumps in there . - How the hell do you know that ? - I dump 2 G 's back in the day here . You lost 2000 dollars ? Damn it ! Spread them out . We 're gonna have to move it . Casey , we need a look out . Up there . Great . Climbing the Eiffel Tower ? Oh , God ! All right . A few years ago that 'd have caused a stir . Well , let the good times roll . Let 's get this done . Get the hell out of here . - Mikey , get the wench . - Yeah . Carlos ! Whoa , whoa , wait . Get back . - Carlos , cover me ! - Go ! Move ! Just get to the back and stay quiet . Go , now , go ! Get down ! Help ! She really is magnificent ! When she is dead , make sure you move in fast . I need a sample of her blood while it is still warm . That won 't be a problem . - Satellite in position ? - Yes , sir . Then shut her down . Mikey ! Mikey ! No ! Oh , God , no ! No ! No ! She 's fighting the condition . Boost the control signal . - Climb ! Give me your hand ! - Help me ! Run ! Go ! Go ! Run ! Let 's go ! L.J. ? L.J. - What is it ? - The satellite , somekind of malfunction . - How long ? - New feed coming online in 15 seconds . Online in 3 , 2 , now ! Where the hell is she going ? Shut her down ! She 's still coming ! Now ! Oh , shit ! You son of a ... Back to base . The antivirus . Get me the antivirus . Why didn 't you shoot ? Because we 're not driving to Alaska while that helicopter intact . Let 's go look in the computer , see where that copper is headed . - How is he ? - Under house arrest , as you instructed . He 's been quiet . How much of this have you used ? The blood increases the creatures power . Also increases the strength of the infection . I needed it . You have no idea what this will do to you . No ! I have an idea . You 're out of control . All this ends here . Under executive order 1345 issued by Chairman Wesker for insubordination and gross misconduct in the field ... . ... I sentence you to summary liquidation . Liquidation ? No , just die . Take the body to the surface , then bring me the stats on Project Alice to see what ... Sir ! Good thing we like a challenge . Hold on ! Hold on ! They have the antivirus in there . Just hold on . It 's too late and you know it . Besides , you need a way to get in there . And I have an idea . - You 'll keep them safe , huh ! - You got it . Come here . Carlos , I 'm ... Save it . You just promise me one thing . When you get down there ... Consider it done . I wish I had a smoke . I 'll be damned . L.J. , sneaky son of a bitch . Oh , hell ! Come on ! Come on ! - Allright , let 's go ! - Get over here ! Get the kids out , quickly ! Go . - Brian ! Come on , hurry up ! - Go , go , go ! Go , go , go , go ! Take him . You 're not coming ? Take care of the others . I 'm sorry , I didn 't mean to startle you . - I am the artificial intelligence which ... - I know what you are . I knew your sister . She was a homicidal bitch . My sister computer was merely following the most logical path for the preservation of the human life . Yeah , kill a few , save a lot ! So , what happened here ? Dr. Isaacs returned in an infected state . He was bitten by a creature that had been treated with a newly developed serum . A serum derived from your blood . The resulting infection has caused massive change . - My blood ? - Your blood has bonded with the T-Virus . Dr. Isaacs correctly deduced that it could be used to destroy the biohazards for good . You mean that my blood is the cure for all this ? Correct . So why are you helping me ? Your blood is pure and this facility contains all the equipment you 'd require to synthesize a cure . You mean , this could all end ? Correct . There is , however , a small problem . I have contained him to the lower levels , but I cannot hold him there for much longer . Allright , let 's go . Alice ! Good luck ! You can 't kill me . I 've told you . I can 't die . For so long , I thought you were the future . I was wrong . I am the future ! No ! You 're just another asshole ! And we 're both going to die down here . Yeah , you 're the future all right . All attempts to contact the North American facility continual fail . - How long they 've been off the air ? - 17 hours . We must consider them lost . But plans remain unchanged . All data will be transferred to this facility and research will continue under my personal supervision . I expect results within 1 month . You won 't have to wait that long , boys ! Because I 'm coming for you . And I ... I 'm gonna be bringing a few of my friends . Subtitle by Darkopal

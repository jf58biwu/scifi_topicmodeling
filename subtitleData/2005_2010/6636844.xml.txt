[ KABLE GRUNTS ] [ GRUNTS ] [ GUNFIRE ] [ BEEPING ] [ GROANING ] Good run , Kable . My name 's Tillman . Whatever your name is , you got to the save point fast . MAN 1 : Who the fuck cares ? No one 's getting out of here alive . MAN 2 : I am . I 'm gonna make it out . Sure you will . They say you got three battles left before you get out . PRODUCER Bob , heh . Yep . Bob . All right , let me handle this . Bob . Do we have the interview or don 't we ? Yes . We are cunt-hair close . I 'm not gonna blow the Three Asian War for " close . " With all due respect , nobody cares about dead Orientals . They care about Ken Castle . Can I hear from Gina , please ? [ GINA SIGHS ] Okay , Bob . Bob . Are you aware Castle has clocked one media appearance ? And that was Walters ' last interview before she died nine years ago . Stop menstruating and just tell me whether we fucking have it . We fucking have it . Good . Palindromes . Okay , focus . Um , let 's get lunch . Iranian , sushi or Mexican ? Uh , no , uh , burger-chili-fry . - I could freak a burger . - Let 's do it . [ GINA SIGHS ] We live in society . We visit " Society . " I mean , which one 's ... ? Which one 's more real , really ? I mean , which one 's really real ? You know what I mean ? ANNOUNCER : You 're watching Gina Parker Smith ... A live Worldlink Tonight exclusive . This motherfucker is off the charts . - He could buy the network . - Yeah , why would he ? Son of a bitch pulls in 650 million pay-per-views for a single broadcast . PRODUCER : Going live . Five , four , three , two , one . GINA : First , there was " Society " . The ultimate SIM environment Where players don 't control . Virtual animated characters But actual living . Breathing human beings . They walked them . They talked them . They juiced them . They rocked them . Rickedy-dickedy-doo . We had that on T-shirts back in 2010 . GINA : The creation of reclusive genius Ken Castle ... [ lN DEEP VOICE ] Who is Ken Castle ? GINA : ... " Society " took the world by storm ... Becoming the number one ... Guilty pleasure ... Of billions . [ lN NORMAL VOICE ] You can get paid to be controlled . Or you pay to control . GINA : And generating one of the world 's ... Largest private fortunes , surpassing ... Bill Gates practically overnight . [ LAUGHS ] GINA : Nine months ago ... Castle unveiled ... A new simulation ... One that would take gaming to new heights ... Of thrilling excess and controversy . [ NARRATOR READS ON-SCREEN TEXT ] GINA : " Slayers . " If " Society " let us live through others ... " Slayers " would let us ... Die through others . " Slayers " gives the gamer full control ... Of a flesh-and-blood human being in full-scale ... Kill-or-be-killed combat . And when we say " flesh and blood " ... We mean flesh ... And blood . [ AUDIENCE APPLAUDING ] " Slayers . " [ lN DEEP VOICE ] " Slayers . " Heh , heh . Why isn 't it murder ? [ lN NORMAL VOICE ] When was the last time ... You saw somebody volunteer to be murdered ? You know every last one of our Slayers ... Is a bona fide death-row inmate ... Offered to participate as an alternative to their sentence . Stay alive for 30 sessions ... Get set free . That 's not a bad goddamned deal . [ AUDIENCE APPLAUDING ] Has any of these men or women survived ... Long enough to be set free ? I 'd remind your audience " Slayers " was put together ... With the full cooperation of the United States federal government . The revenue it produces is responsible for funding ... Our entire prison system , keeping the bad guys behind bars ... And that the prop was voted for by 68 percent ... - ... of the American public . - In an election tainted by suspected ... Digital fraud . Let 's talk about the so-called ... " genericons " ... Sent into the " Slayers " ... Environment ... With pre-programmed actions ... With no one controlling them ... And no way to react . Their chances of survival are next to nil . Plenty of men and women in prison who 'd never cut it as Slayers . Shouldn 't they be given the same chance ? Roll the dice for a ticket out ? They only need to survive one session . Right . So , Mr. Castle , how the hell does it work ? CASTLE : It begins with a single nano cell ... Planted in the motor cortex of the brain . This cell can replicate ... Replacing the cells around it with perfect copies . And these copied cells contain remote-access functionality . Therefore , nano plus cortex ... Equals a nanex . Isn 't it true that every human that undergoes this procedure ... Will have a distinct lP address ... Like a mobile device ... Or a notebook computer ? Similar , but control is localized ... To the parameters of our gaming environments . You take " Society , " for instance . Once a cast member ... Has left the workplace , they are free ... From the control and monitoring of their player . [ WHISPERING ] Well , that 's a relief . Well , to some , maybe . To some . Don 't you suspect a good many folks wouldn 't mind a bit of control ? - Uh , uh ... - Someone else making ... All the decisions for you . No tough choices ... No responsibilities . Think about it . [ lN NORMAL VOICE ] We will , Mr. Castle . We will . [ AUDIENCE APPLAUDING ] ANNOUNCER 1 : The Gina Parker Smith Show , sponsored by : ANNOUNCER 2 : " Slayers . " A good little talk . Oh , shit , my pleasure . Can I just tell you , I cannot ... Wait until the next " Slayers . " I mean , Kable has been unbelievable . His arms are just so ... Well , I know it 's terrible . [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] [ STATIC BUZZES ] Uh , what the hell was that ? Ken Castle wants you to believe you are living in a better world . He 's a liar . Mind control ... Is slavery . Sorry . Mr. Castle ... - ... we have no idea ... - Shh . Shush . We will all be his dog if we allow this evolution to continue . [ BELCH SOUND PLAYS ON STEREO ] [ CASTLE LAUGHS ] That 's a goddamn hoot .

So sharp and vivid ... It feels like you could reach out and touch the wet flesh ... They 're gonna change their point of view . They 'll be seduced by the power , the violence , the dominance . - It 's human nature . - Kable 's made it through 28 battles . Every player in the game is trying to take him out . Yeah , Kable 's a perfect soldier . He 's a tactical killing computer . His only vulnerability is the nanex itself ... The : The delay between Simon 's commands ... And Kable 's ability to execute .

The new tissue would ... Never break down , never deteriorate . " A new era in human longevity . " That 's what they told us . Nine weeks later ... Scotch was dead . And you were serving life in maximum . Castle 's project was shut down . But the same technology resurfaced within a year . In a game . Castle called it " Society . " Listen , whatever happened ...

[ SNIFFS ] [ CASTLE SIGHS ] I wanted to thank you for leading me to them , by the way . The Humanz 's cell , that is . I killed most of them . Sooner or later , they 'd be whistling my tune just like everybody else . It was that cracker program ... That got my attention . That was a genuine nuisance . No doubt about it . One thing even they didn 't know . I 'm wired too . I replaced ... 98 percent of my own noodle with nano tissue years ago . But mine 's different . It 's built to send .

 The 4400 Season 3 Episode 9 ( 2006 ) - The Ballad Of Kevin And Tess - SYNC CORRECTIONS : klepal We 're not a threat , we 're salvation . The world will have to deal with us . Previously on the 4400 ... you 're so sweet . I wish i could take you with me when i go , but i can 't . [ Diana ] : Yesterday , a few patients were compelled to work on this thing , and today , it 's the entire hospital . If we get tess out of here , do you think this compulsion will fade ? I 'm injecting myself with a modified version of the promicin serum . I will have taught my body how to produce promicin , and then i will be the first non-returnee to develop 4400 abilities . Enough running , dr . Burkhoff . You need to come with us now . No . Stay back . I don 't want to hurt anyone . That 's very reassuring . We 'll keep that in mind . No ! No ! [ Gasping ] : No ! Mr. Tyler . Come in . What can i do for you ? I wanted to ask you about your work with the students here . Sure . I teach three classes , history , art , and ... i 'm not talking about your teaching . I was talking about the " counseling " that you do . I understand you use your ability with the kids ? That 's right . My ability is to help them focus their abilities . It 's pretty much what i 've been doing ever since i came back . If a student has a talent ... like all of our kids here do ... i help them learn how to use it , gain control of it , build their confidence . Does it work with adults ? It didn 't used to , but i haven 't tried it since i 've been off the inhibitor . Why ? I developed this ability a few months ago ... telekinesis . What a word , huh ? I can 't even say it with a straight face . That 's fantastic . I 've just been pretending it isn 't there . I mean , i know a little bit about it . So far , it only works with inanimate objects , little stuff . But when i 'm mad or excited , i can do a lot more with it . And you 're looking to control it when you 're calm ? Yeah , that 's why i 'm here , i guess . How many times do i have to go over this with you people ? I have not been injecting promicin into anyone but myself . You 're certain of that ? You 're a world-class scientist . I find it difficult to believe you wouldn 't build a redundancy plan into your experiment . This isn 't your basic sleep study . I mean , look at me . Do you think i 'd have an easy time finding volunteers ? No . I do not . Oh . You look like you 're in quite a bit of discomfort to me . [ Chuckles bitterly ] : Yes . As a matter of fact , i am . Well ... you can relax now . The experiment 's over . This will only hurt for a minute . Bag him . We 'll take him back for the autopsy . Get dr . Burkhoff up there quickly . They promised results by the morning . [ * * * ] * so long ago , another life * * i can feel your heart beat * * it 's not a dream remember us * * i can see it in your eyes * * we 'll find our place in time * * our place in time beyond the sun * * we 'll find our place in time * * our place in time to call our own * Mommy ? Mommy ? Are you okay ? Of course , sweetie . I 'm fine . Why wouldn 't i be ? I had a bad dream , and you were in it . Well , you get in and tell me about it . You turned into a monster . It was horrible . It seemed so real . It was you . But you were different . What kind of a monster ? Nice . Something for the refrigerator door . You don 't think there 's anything to this ? It 's not a prediction , right ? Just a bad dream . Well , i hope so , but when your daughter 's a precog , you don 't want her giving you a picture like this . Hello . This is skouris . Well , thank you for calling me back . Let me know if you see him , all right ? Everything okay ? Maybe . I 'm not sure . I mean , that was the 4400 center . I was hoping maybe they 'd seen dr . Burkhoff . I stopped by his apartment yesterday , and he wasn 't home . Uh , diana . Why would you be stopping by dr . Burkhoff 's apartment ? You actually saw the wound in kevin 's hand heal over ? Yes . He pulled the scalpel out , and it was gone within seconds . He 's developing an ability . I mean , he 's close to it , anyway . He said it comes and goes . What ? Anyone else developing a 4400 ability i should know about ? I should have told you earlier . You 're damn right you should have . Got to hand it to you , diana ... some people play racketball in their spare time , maybe collect old records , but you ? You play igor to the one man who ... Well , if he has developed an ability , like you say , maybe he really is the father of 4400 technology , just like the future predicted . Are you two the only ones who know about this experiment ? I thought we were ... and now i 'm not so sure , and that 's what i 'm worried about . Tom , what if someone else finds out what he 's up to ? Well , if he succeeds , we could be talking about the mass-marketing of 4400 abilities . A lot of people would like to keep that genie in the bottle . Wouldn 't make our jobs any easier . Are you ... are you okay ? It 's just my allergies are acting up . I 've already spoken to his family . They haven 't heard from him in months . Okay , so who else is he close to ? " I didn 't know " that cheshire cats always grinned ... in fact , i didn 't know that cats could grin , " said alice very politely . " You don 't know much , " said the duchess . " And that 's a fact . " We 'll finish this chapter tomorrow . I hope you all can make it . I 've been living in a halfway house for about three months . I got this job here two weeks ago . That 's great , tess . So they found a medication that works for you ? So far , so good . I still have my disease . Schizophrenia never goes away , but i haven 't had any symptoms for a while . Hopefully i won 't . So these kids you 're reading to , they 're not going to try and build a tower to contact the future , are they ? I don 't think so . I can barely remember all that now . I 'm still not sure how i could compel people to work or why they put those blueprints in my head . I 'm glad it made kevin better , but it was still so weird . That 's actually why we 're here . Have you been in touch with kevin lately ? No . I called him when i first got out of the institution . We met for coffee , but i haven 't seen him in months . Is he okay ? Well , we 're not sure , but we 'd like to talk to him . So , if he contacts you , would you let us know ? Well , of course . When you find him , will you have him call me ? Sure . It 's nice to see you again , tess . Bye . I just spoke with the program coordinator . She says the first segment will be interviews with some of the people you 've healed and then they 'll bring you out after the break . She says the emotional stuff also plays well with her audience , so feel free to cry or ... we 'll see about that . They 're also curious about the wedding . She 'd love it if you answered some questions ... let 's keep the private life private , okay ? [ Woman ] : Nick ! Nick , please , wake up ! Nick ! Nick , please , wake up ! Oh , jesus , that 's nick crowley . Oh , my god . You 're that 4400 , the one with the hands . Help him , please ! Nick ! Nick ! Come on , wake up . Please ! If you 're okay , say something . Well , jim morrison says hello . [ Scattered laughter ] Easy . Easy , boys , easy . You just saved nick crowley . On behalf of millions of rock and roll burnouts all over the world , allow me to thank you . Any time you want to lay these on me , you just let me know . It was a little bit big , so i just had it resized . It 's perfect now . I think mom would be really happy , don 't you ? Lily gave you that ring . I guess you can do what you want with it . I think it 's perfect . Have you thought about what you 're going to say at the wedding ? Usually , the father of the bride gives a toast . Um ... well . It 's all been so sudden . I haven 't had much time to really plan it yet . That 's okay . I have a few thoughts . There 's an article in this magazine on toasts . Read it . I think i can handle that on my own . Dad , i want you to read it . Tonight . Hi . I bought some food . Let me help you with that . Thank you . My joints are a little stiff . Kevin , why did you put your hood up when i came in ? You shouldn 't have to look at me like this . Like what ? Diana skouris and tom baldwin came by the bookstore today . They were asking about you . I figured diana would be worried . How did she look ? Okay , i guess . A little sick . Kevin , i felt bad seeing her . I don 't like what we 're doing to her ... what i 'm doing to her . I don 't like it much , either , but we are on the cusp of changing the world ... for the better . We have to keep going , even if it gets ugly . Kevin , it 's already ugly . Someone shot you yesterday . I know , but the experiment is worth the risk . They woke me up to do this . You woke me up to do this . I have to move forward . And to do that , i need diana . And i need you . Is shawn farrell around ? I have something for him . Oh ! I played that when we were recording my first album . I 've been holding onto it for years . You 're really giving this to me ? You saved my life . Seems like a fair trade to me . So this , uh , ability of yours ... it works every time out of the gate ? Yeah , pretty much . Oh , my god . I wish they brought you back 15 years ago . A career in rock ' n ' roll ... sometimes it feels like you 're living in a war zone . You lose a lot of people along the way . One day you look up , and you 're the last man standing . You should take better care of yourself . I 'm not always around . I feel like i owe you more than a guitar . We 're playing tomorrow night and i wanted to invite you backstage . You can hang out , watch the show from the wings . Really ? Sure . I figure it 'll be handy having you around . If i keel over , you can always come out and do your " hands of god " thing for an encore . It 's cold . You should bring your jacket . She didn 't say anything on the way over ? Of course not , kevin . She hardly ever does . You 're so brave . I always wanted to give it to you first . I thought you deserved an ability . I 'm sorry it has to happen without your permission . Can i get this started ? Give dr . Burkhoff your hand . mommy be late for school if we don 't leave soon . I 'm sorry , baby . I slept through my alarm . I 'll be ready in a few ... Mommy , are you okay ? I 'm fine . I just broke a nail is all . Ew . Ew . Hi . Hey , marco . What are you doing down here ? Tom asked me to check out dr . Burkhoff 's computers . Uh , you okay ? I heard you had the flu . Hey . I thought you were taking a sick day . Would everyone please stop treating me like a plague patient ? I 'm fine . Have we learned anything here ? Dr. Burkhoff 's computers are clean . Like , completely clean . I mean , there 're no saved files , no records of anything . It 's like someone took out his hard drives and swapped them for new ones . So either he took them somewhere ... or someone else has them . Diana . Look at this . Is that ... kevin ? Yeah . My god . These are the side effects of the injections ? I haven 't seen him in a couple of weeks . I had no idea he 'd gotten so bad . Think it 's a self-portrait ? No way . Kevin 's hands weren 't steady enough to make coffee . Didn 't tess like to draw ? I feel like i 'm in a staring contest . It 's okay . I know it can be a little awkward at first . So , sometimes when i 'm having trouble getting started with a student , i 'll take their hand . It helps everything get rolling . You up for it ? Yeah . I guess . Just relax , okay ? Mm . Oh . I 'm sorry . I , uh ... to be honest , i felt a little awkward . I , uh , i haven 't had someone touch me like that since , uh ... my wife passed , and ... it 's okay . Sometimes it takes more than one session to make headway . [ Distorted voice ] : Diana ? [ Distorted ] : Diana ? [ Normal voice ] : Should i just call you a cab ? I can handle this if you want . No , i 'm okay . Any sign of tess ? No , she hasn 't come out yet . Look , tom . I made an appointment with the doctor for tomorrow morning , but , for now , i 'd just like to stick with it , okay ? I have to say , this does not feel like the flu . It 's like i 'm dragging myself around . Here she is . Come in . Hey . What ? Different look for you . " Look ? " I dressed like this for 10 years . Hey , you 're not going to ask about the wedding , are you ? I am officially taking the night off from all planning . This has nothing to do with the wedding ... unless nick crowley 's invited . He 's downstairs . Really ? No , i 'm getting ready for his show . Maybe he wants to give me a ride or something . Uh , i don 't think that 's it . Well , what ? [ Slurring ] : I never get enough refills . I mean , look at me ... What 's he saying ? Nick has a prescription for antabuse . They 're these pills that are supposed to help him cut back on his drinking . He finally tried some . I guess he overdid it , huh ? It 's the same thing he does with everything . He insisted on coming here instead of the hospital . Do your worst . Please ? Come to my arms , my beamish boy . Lie down . Lie down . You 're my little lifeline . Kevin . Dr. Burkhoff , i 've been worried about you . What are you doing , hiding up here ? My god . Look at you . Dr. Burkhoff , you need to come with us . We 're going to get you some help . I can 't do that . People are trying to kill me . What people ? Who 's trying to kill you ? I think they work for the government . They don 't work for ntac . Are you sure about that ? Because i 'm not . Listen , kevin . You know us . If you come in , we 'll protect you . And , besides , i 'm not taking no for an answer . Come on . Actually , i think you 're going to have to . Diana ? What the hell are you doing ? I don 't know , tom . I 'm sorry . Diana 's not quite herself right now . She 'll do whatever tess wants her to . Tess , will you get his gun , please ? Please . I am so close to finishing . Stop trying to find me . I have no desire to hurt you . Diana ... are you okay ? Are you all right ? I don 't know . What happened ? You pulled your gun on me . Tess ? Yeah . [ Groaning ] : Oh , god . What ? Something 's wrong . I just feel weird . Oh , my god . What are those ? They 're lesions . They 're just like the ones kevin had when he started taking promicin . We need to get you to ntac medical . If there 's anything at all to these experiments dr . Burkhoff has been conducting , a lot of people in d.c. Are going to want to look over his notes . These pictures have already been circulated to local law enforcement . We 're going to distribute them around the neighborhood near dr . Burkhoff 's apartment and the vacation home where he was hiding . Maybe we 'll get lucky . So , what , we 're supposed to tell people that there 's some kind of monster on the loose ? If anyone asks , we tell them dr . Burkhoff has werner syndrome . It 's a rare wasting disease . Okay . But do you really think we 'll be able to bring this guy in safe and sound ? I mean , some cowboy cop sees this stumbling towards him , you don 't think he might shoot first and ask questions later ? That 's why we have to get to him first . Whatever dr . Burkhoff is guilty of , he saved thousands of lives during the inhibitor scandal . The good thing about his condition is , it shouldn 't make him too hard to spot . I don 't know . They 're nice hands , but they don 't look magical or anything . Making friends already ? Hey . You 've chosen wisely . I speak from experience . The show was amazing . Thank you so much for having me . What are you thanking me for ? The show would 've been canceled if not for you . Listen . I just had the best idea during the encore . Why don 't you come out on the road with us ? And do what ? Well , you could start with mischa and work your way onward from there . [ Chuckles ] Okay , yeah , it 's tempting , but i kind of have a lot on my plate here in seattle , you know ? I 'm supposed to get married soon . Well , in that case , you have to come with us . It 'll be like an extended bachelor party . We 'll take good care of you . Promise . And a promise from mischa is money in the bank . Besides , i like having you along with us . You keep me ... limber . You mean upright ? Well , yeah , that too . Um , it 's just i 'm not your personal physician , you know ? Of course you 're not . You 're a hell of a lot better than any doctor i 've ever met . Oh . Think about it . But not too long . What 's to think about ? Who could say " no " to all of this ? * mr . Sandman bring me a dream * * bom , bom bom , bom * * make him the cutest i 've ever seen * * bom , bom bom , bom * so what can i get you this morning ? * then tell him * * that his lonesome nights are over * could i have the steak and eggs ? Could you make the steak extremely rare ? * nobody to call my own * * bom , bom bom , bom * * please turn on your magic beam * * mr . Sandman bring me a dream * * thanks . Dr. Burkhoff was spotted at a diner in beacon hill . He 's there right now . Bring him in quietly , if you can , but bring him in . Diana , wake up . Dr. Anapurn . I thought i was supposed to sleep . You gave me drugs ... you 're being discharged . You need to come with me . [ Grunts ] I don 't know . I guess he left about 15 minutes ago . Did he say where he was headed ? No . I mean , he didn 't even touch the food he ordered , right ? He just left in a hurry . Left a good tip , though . Where are we going ? Thank you . You can go back to your office now . Tess , don 't do this . I 'm sorry . I wish it didn 't have to be you , but there 's no one else . We 'd better go . He 'll be waiting for us . How could i have done that ? I don 't remember any of it . Diana doesn 't remember going to kevin 's apartment at night , either . If dr . Burkhoff 's willing to break her out of here , he must be getting desperate . Feels like he 's running out of time . Which means he has to complete the experiment . He 's going to up her dosage . If we don 't find diana soon , she 's going to wind up in the same shape as kevin . I think it 's the silence that 's messing us up . It 's too awkward . So instead of us just staring at each other , i thought we 'll talk . Okay . Um ... is there something specific you wanted to talk about ? No . You pick . Well , i 've been thinking about my parents a lot lately , what they 'd think of all this , this place ... me , sitting here trying to figure out how to use my ... telekinetic ability ? You know , you can say it out loud . It 's nothing to be embarrassed about . Yeah , you can say that , but when i first got back , i was a 4400 , but i didn 't have an ability . I felt normal . It was something i could hold on to . Now you have to get used to the idea that you 're special . Is that what my parents would think if they were here ? Or would they just think that their son had become a freak ? Richard . When you got taken , you were one of the first black pilots in all of the military . You were at the vanguard . Now you 're part of a different vanguard . There 's a reason they picked you . I think your parents would be proud . Yeah . Uh ... maybe that 's true . Richard ? Whoa . Well , i guess that worked , huh ? This will be fine . We can work here for a while . Tell him he can go home . Please . You have to help me . Say something . Don 't bother . He 's not going to remember any of this . Thank you . You can go home now . [ Coughing violently ] Kevin ? Can i get you some water ? I 'm fine . Kevin . You 're dying . You 're killing yourself . And now you 're going to kill me , too . No . You will not die . My work ... is valid . Are you sure ? Look at yourself . If it isn 't working in me , the fault isn 't with the experiment . It 's with me . All those years , the shock treatments , the fistfuls of medications , they must have changed me . I 'm not a good subject . There is no good subject . Kevin , you 're brilliant , but you 're wrong . You failed , and you 're not thinking clearly enough to see that . My mind is not compromised . We are at a point , diana , where it would be easy for the timid to turn back . We have to be braver than that . And , if necessary ... [ diana , pleading ] : Oh . No ... oh ... i 'm prepared to be brave enough for both of us . Working on a song ? The end of one . Can 't nail it , though . Inspiration . Are you shocked i 'm drinking my lunch ? I didn 't say anything . Good , because this is ... listen ... this here is called " maintaining a base level . " That 's kind of scary , actually . Shawn . Don 't worry . I 've made a solemn vow not to over-indulge ... unless , of course , you 're around . Yeah , that 's kind of the thing . You 're not going to be around , is that it ? You 're not coming on the road ? I wanted to . It 's just ... you know , even if it was for a little while . This gift i have , though , it 's kind of a responsibility , you know ? And i don 't mean to be harsh , man , but i don 't think it was meant to be used as a rock star 's personal safety net . You don 't know that . Maybe they sent you back to keep me alive so i could finish my album . Nick , if you go down again ... i can 't be there for you . There 's still time , you know . We can save him . I think maybe you don 't have enough faith in kevin . He can do this . He 's special . That 's why they had me wake him up . Tess ? I packed an adrenaline shot when we left the cabin . Have you seen it ? No . I need it . It has to be here in case i slip under . Ah . Kevin ? I think i got stung by a bee . What is this ? Don 't move , dr . Burkhoff ! Tess ? There 's nowhere to go . We 've got this place surrounded . Nobody fire . He 's not going anywhere . Diana , are you all right ? Tom . Whoa . Hold still , burkhoff . Put your hands up . Burkhoff ! They won 't be able to hide for long . Tess will run out of meds . Dr. Burkhoff is not exactly inconspicuous . They 'll show themselves , we 'll find them . You mean we 'll find tess . It doesn 't sound like burkhoff will live out the week . I don 't get it . He was supposed to be the father of 4400 technology . That 's why they woke him up . Well , that 's just our theory . Maybe you 're putting too much faith in the future . Diana 's okay ? Yeah , she 'll get there . She 's down in ntac medical . You got us a ride . Someone let me borrow them . * all this feels strange and untrue * * and i won 't waste a minute without you * * my bones ache my skin feels cold * * and i 'm getting so tired * * and so old * * tell me that you 'll open your eyes * * tell me that you 'll open your eyes * * all this feels strange and untrue * * and i won 't waste a minute without you * * mr . Ryland wants a status report on the promicin . We 're good . Great , actually . We have enough of a stockpile to last us for almost two years .

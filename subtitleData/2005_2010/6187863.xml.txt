 [ Maddux Narrating ] My father used to say that if whiskey was courage in a bottle ... there 'd be a national monument in his name . [ Baby Crying ] His point - other than he drank too much - was that courage isn 't something you can buy . It 's something you find . - Are you hearing it , Donner ? - No . L-I 'm not hearing anything , Zoe . But you need to turn around and come back to the lander . Do you copy ? Zoe , turn around and come back to the lander . - [ Crying Continues ] - Not without the baby . There isn 't a baby . You 're on Venus . Have we muted their comm ? Right after the missed landing . That exchange was clear . - And the recorded E.V. A ? - Up and running . Go to it . Um , Paula , we need a live shot of you on the flight deck ... to make the transition to the recording . Paula . Yes . Copy that . Wass ? Yeah , I 'm on it . - [ Beeps ] - [ Paula ] I 'm ready . You may have noticed that Zoe has very little mobility in her pressure suit . It 's obviously an hallucination . Was she hearing the baby on the ship ? [ Paula Continues ] She said it was guilt-related . Did she tell you the reason ? No . She never told me . Why would she be hallucinating a baby ? [ Sighs ] She aborted one in her first year of training . And I wasn 't told . There are certain personal decisions that I think should remain personal . [ Paula ] She will have to rely on her boots , which were specially designed ... to pick up dirt instead of repel it . All Zoe has to do is walk around a little - And cut to the recording . And then step on the sled that she 's been towing behind her ... and deposit any of the samples that her boots have collected . Anyone bothered by the black boulder thatjust appeared ... a hundred meters out in the fake footage ? 11 : 00 . It 's small . Can we edit it on the fly ? From this point on . Let 's see what they can do . [ Zoe On Recording ] I think I 'm getting some pretty good samples here ... although I 'm not sure my mother would approve of my dirty feet . Can you pull up the helmet cam , please ? Donner , I need for you to get her back on the lander now . - That suit is only good for 20 minutes . - Ted , she 's hearing a baby . She 's not listening to me . Zoe ? There 's no baby . Repeat . There is no baby . - Now get back to the lander . - I hear it . [ Crying Continues ] - I can get it . - You 're hallucinating . Is this the same thing that you were hearing on the ship ? It 's not on the ship anymore . It 's here . - ? [ Rock Ballad On Speakers ] - [ Door Opens ] - [ Maddux ] Zoe . - [ Jen ] Oh , crap . Listen . The hell you doing ? - [ Jen ] She 's getting a tattoo , Donner . - A big tattoo . - Big tattoo of what ? - [ Zoe ] An eagle . - The omen eagle ? - You know about the omen eagle ? - Isn 't that the reason she 's leaving ? - [ Zoe ] No . No . It 's not the reason I 'm leaving . I was asked to leave . I got kicked out . - Not by me . - No , not by you , Donner . This isn 't about you . - This is about me . It 's about where I 'm going . - Lady , you need to sit still . This eagle on my back-it marks a turning point in my life . All right ? There is pre-eagle , and there is post-eagle . You , Donner , are pre-eagle . Well , actually , I 'm here right now , so that makes me mid-eagle too . I really can 't do this right now . Guys , you know what ? Can you take Donner home ? I 'm not going home . I 'm seeing her to the station . - So meet us at the train station . - I was just there . So go back . She doesn 't want you here , all right ? We 'll be there in a couple ofhours . You can say good-bye then . - Rollie , please . - Uh , I 'm your ride . Right . Ajay , please . Sure . Donner , I guess we should go . - [ Maddux ] Huh ? - And , um - [ Whispers ] Don 't say anything . I would never say anything . Well , you might . Well , you could . You know , destiny and man 's right to know - whatever . - But ... don 't . - I won 't . - Thank you . - After you . - Ajay , how long has she been out ? - Seven minutes . All systems on her suit are nominal . She 's 150 meters from the lander , still outbound . She 's got three minutes to turn around , or she 's not making it back . Okay , Zoe , you gotta listen to me now . This Gamma object has got you hearing things . [ Breathing Heavily ] I know what I 'm hearing , Donner . No , you don 't . You don 't know what you 're hearing ... because there is no baby on Venus . Turn around right now , or you 're not gonna make it back to the ship . You understand ? I need you to get me a private comm with her . - I think we can get through working with Donner . - No Donner . Just me and Zoe . I need to speak to her privately . Do it . Venus lander , this is Antares . - I need you tojump off this comm . - I 'm a little busy here , Ted . Jen thinks she can get through to her . - Doesn 't want anyone else on the line . - She doesn 't want me on the line ? - She doesn 't want anyone . - All right . Going to 6 . - Mission Control , do you copy ? - Let her try privately . Roger that . We 're moving to channel 6 with Donner . It 's all yours . Hey , Zoe , it 's Jen . Do you copy ? Jen ? Is that you ? Yeah . I got us on a private comm so we could have a little girl talk . You know what I finally came up with ? Yeah . Marking the day with a footprint . That 's nice . It 's really nice . Footprint 's easier than a tattoo . Yeah . Well , it 's not looking so easy right now , Zoe . - I 'm gonna make it , Jen . - [ Baby Crying ] Only if you turn back right now , Zoe . That suit is certified for 20 minutes on Venus - not 25 , not 30 . - [ Crying Continues ] - I hear the baby . Look , that 's the hallucination . You know that . No . This is different . It 's not your baby , Zoe . I know that you think it is , but it 's not . Your baby 's gone . - [ Crying Continues ] - You 're wrong . - It 's right up ahead . - No , no , no . This isn 't you . Zoe , please , can you hear yourself ? Hey , that thing is making you hear the baby . It wants to kill you . - [ Crying Continues ] - I 'm gonna get it . It 'll be okay . Where you 're going there is no coming back . Okay , there 's no pre-eagle . There 's no post-eagle . There 's just ... nothing . Please don 't leave us . Don 't do this . We need you on this ship . Please , Zoe , turn back now . Zoe ? You did the best you could . She 's gonna die out there , isn 't she ? And if Donner tries to wait for her , so will he . No . We can 't let him do that . This isn 't Mars . No , it 's not , but it sure feels that way . [ Suit Motors Whirring ] [ Crying Continues ] Passing a probe now . That 's the Chinese attempt from ' 43 . She 's now at 200 meters , still outbound . Ten minutes on the surface . No return . If they want us to retrieve them ... why the hell do they keep killing us ? She 's not dead yet , Mike . In fact , she 's our only hope . - Hey , Z , I 'm back . - Copy that , Donner . How 's Jen ? You guys have a nice talk ? - I 'm not turning around . - I see that . You just passed your no-return . Yeah . Heads-up is flashing . Choosing to ignore it . Does Jen have some idea why you 're hearing a baby ? 'Cause I can 't help but think if I knew the answer to that , I could talk you back here . Yeah , I don 't think so , Donner . I don 't get women . I mean , I get women . - L-I don 't get women . - I think aside from the obvious ways ... they 're really not that much different than you and I. No . Wrong . They 're way different . What if you were the ASCAN who didn 't make the cut ? Would you just hang out and wait for Zoe ? - No . I 'm not gonna have the failure rubbed in my face . - Exactly . You wouldn 't wait around , and neither would I. Well , I wouldn 't get a damn tattoo . Maybe she needed it , like a ritual - a way to say good-bye . I could think of a lot of ways that are less painful and permanent . I think the pain and the permanence are the whole reason she did it . These last few months , they 've been really emotional for Zoe . Well , it 's not like I 'm responsible for that . Are you saying I 'm responsible for that ? How am I responsible for that ? [ Baby Crying ] Another failed probe . Those were ours she just passed . - Were those ours ? - Yeah . We sent two . - Where did they launch from ? - Canaveral . Canaveral 's underwater . I guess they can cover up anything . Barnes will now drag her sled back to its dock ... then go onto the platform that will lift her into the lander . So far , this has been a textbook mission . - She 's 20 meters to target . - Poe , I need to know her surface time . Uh , 16 minutes , 37 seconds . Thermal cooling is coming off nominal . - We should start to see seal failures in five minutes . - [ Mike ] The lander ? Cross-bus T.C.S. Is also sub-nominal . Internal temperature 's 25 degrees Celsius and rising fast . Donner , you 're gonna have to switch to suit pack soon . T.C.S. On your lander is starting to fail . Uh , roger that . It is getting hot in here . I also need you to think about your launch sequence . I 'll think about it . We 're gonna hold off on that for now . You 're gonna have to be ready when she goes down , Maddux . Yeah , I heard you the first time , Rollie . Okay ? I get it . And it 's not Mars . I got that too . But I 'm the guy that missed this landing . - There was a crosswind . - That doesn 't matter . That was my responsibility . And it 's my responsibility to make sure that she gets every chance possible to get back . I owe her that much . Copy that . I know he said this isn 't Mars , but ... it 's exactly what happened on Mars . Then you have to stop him . Ted , you do . Talk some sense into him . Don 't let this happen again . Donner , listen , buddy . Hey , you 're really making us nervous up here . So what I need you to do is I need for you to get back onto that - When she goes down , I 'll go . Until then , she gets every chance . [ Paula ] Once inside , Donner will have the hatch sealed ... then depressurize and cool off the lower compartment . Zoe 's suit will depressurize on the way back to the ship . We all have to start getting ready for Zoe and Donner 's return . I hope you all are as excited and as happy and proud ... as we are all . From Antares , I am Paula Morales , signing off . - [ Sniffles ] - Paula , we 're proud of you . You did a great job . - That was a fairy tale . - It 's the way we wanted it to be . It 's not the way it is . - I need some air . - Paula - [ Suit Motors Whirring ] [ Baby Crying ] - [ Beeps ] - Flight , be advised she 's running a low-grade fever . - Her suit temperature ? - Nominal . This fever 's consistent with the Beta hallucinations . She 's approaching the target . The ASCAN eliminations-how 'd we do ? Aside from Wassenfelder , they did pretty good . - Barnes ? - That 's the surprise . I haven 't been able to sleep the last couple nights . Yeah , well , that should probably tell you something . - I have no idea who else I 'd get rid of . - I 'm sure that can 't be easy . [ Sighs ] I tell myself , you know , maybe she 's lucky . Maybe I just gave her a chance to live a normal life . - She would never think that . - No . Sharon Lewis wouldn 't have thought that either . Buy you dinner ? Tonight I would like a little normal . - [ Buzzing ] - For the record , I think they screwed up not picking you . - Thanks , Rollie . - Just my opinion . - Looks good . - Thanks . - That was sweet . Odd , but sweet . - Yeah . Rollie is a good man , and he has a huge crush on you . Yeah , but I got this whole Ted mess . It 's sex . It 's not a relationship . Well , maybe I don 't want a relationship . - We all do . - Nadia doesn 't . - Nadia 's different . - Nadia 's smart . 'Cause Nadia knows that relationships lead to things . - Yeah , like feelings . - Yeah , and compromise . - And babies . - And pain . Relationships also lead to pain . Yes . Yes , they do . [ Buzzing Continues ] - Please tell me we 're almost done . - Almost done . And relationships end . Honey , they don 't have to . I just wanna know if I 'm post-eagle . - I 'm gonna be post-eagle , right ? - [ Laughs ] That 's 20 minutes on the surface . Donner needs to get off . He will get off when the time is right . The lander is going to start falling apart . It won 't make it back to the ship ! - Donner , you need to start your launch sequence . - Nadia . - Donner ! - Stand by , Antares . Just a few more minutes . Not a few more minutes ! Now , Donner ! Now ! Start your launch sequence ! Donner ? [ Breathing Heavily ] She 's stopping . She 's at the site . [ Crying Continues ] I can see it . Uh , it 's here . My baby 's here . She 's seeing it as a baby . [ Cooing ] He 's coming to me . He 's floating up to me . Oh , Zoe . Zoe , it 's amazing . Zoe , listen . As soon as you have it , you need to start back for the lander . - Do you copy ? - Roger that . Twenty minutes on the surface . Thermal cooling is starting to fail . Internal temperature in the suit is 40 degrees centigrade . - That 's 104 Fahrenheit . - That 's the same thing on the lander . L - I have him in my arms . I have him in my arms . All right , go . Go for the lander . Hurry . She 's got it . She 's got Gamma . Doesn 't matter . She 'll never make it . - [ Wass ] You don 't know that . - Come on . I 'm coming , Donner . Coming with our baby . Coming with our baby boy . Our baby ? [ No Audible Dialogue ] Zoe 's burst cyst in the first year of training was a botched abortion . And Donner was the father . - Yeah . - [ Exhales ] Damn . He 'd had a vasectomy after Mars . It somehow reverted . - We discovered it on his last physical . - Do you think he realizes ? [ Maddux ] Uh , Control , I 'd like to get a private comm with Ajay . - I have a couple questions about the lander . - [ Ajay ] He realizes . [ Mike ] Talk to him on 6 . - He 's not gonna leave without her . - I think I get that . - [ Ajay ] Donner , go to 6 . - [ Beeps ] - Aje ? You there ? - I 'm here , Donner . Hey . Uh - Do you remember me telling you I 'd been snipped ? - Claire told us . It somehow reverted . - Yeah , uh - This whole deal with Zoe , uh - That cyst thing first year wasn 't really a cyst , was it ? That 's correct , Maddux . It 's my baby . Yes . - It 's my rule . - What is ? It 's the reason Zoe 's leaving . It 's my " I don 't screw astronauts " rule , isn 't it ? I mean , you know , the part that 's - that 's - About that - [ Sighs ] I get it . I get it . I get the tattoo , you know ? When I got back from Mars , you know what I did first thing ? - What ? - I got a vasectomy . I got snipped . You got a vasectomy ? Yeah . That 's painful , permanent . You know why I did it ? I did it because I didn 't want a wife . I didn 't want kids . I didn 't want anybody to have to go through ... what I experienced with losing Sharon . When you do this thing that we do ... death 's just part of the deal . So don 't screw astronauts . Don 't have kids . [ Sighs ] You have one-night stands . That 's my life . You know ? That 's my rule . Okay . Well , I 'm gonna need some help holding this go-cart together ... 'cause there 's no way in hell I 'm leaving here without her . - Roger that . - [ Beeping ] Zoe , how we doing ? It 's getting a little warm out here , but we 're doing fine . [ Thunder Rumbling ] You just keep on moving . This bus isn 't going anywhere without you too . - How 's she doing ? - Not great . Dehydrated . Heart rate 's through the roof . Why would these things go through so much trouble jus-just to kill us ? See , that 's the thing that 's been bothering me . - That 's what thing ? - Well , there 's no logic to that . Maybe it 's some kind of test - maybe the whole idea is that it isn 't supposed to be easy . It 's like the trials ofJob . The devil took everything from Job ... hoping he 'd renounce his faith . Yeah , but-Yeah , but he didn 't , right ? [ Paula ] No , Steven . He didn 't . Okay , her suit 's off nominal in all areas . Servo motors , thermal cooling seals are close to going . - What 's her distance to the lander ? - Hundred and fifty meters . - That 's at least another seven minutes . - Ideas ? Come on ! Ideas , people ! Ajay , spitball with me here for a second . If the cooling systems are working too hard ... maybe we back ' em off a notch or two and just let the internal temp rise . No . The heat could kill her . She 's working a lot harder than you are , Donner . But with less temperature differential , the seals might last a little longer . Look , we need to do anything we can to give her more time . - What 's the suit temp now ? - 43 centigrade . I 'll let her go to 49 . That 's 120 Fahrenheit . No more . - What about you , Donner ? - Don 't worry about the lander . I got my suit . We 'll let you take it to 60 , Donner , but that 's the limit . - Do it . - [ Maddux ] All right . Zoe , listen , we 're gonna crank the thermostat up here ... to give the T.C.S. A breather , so it 's gonna get hot . Already hot , Donner . - Think I 'm gonna puke . - Oh , don 't do that . You don 't get a bucket if you 're already an astronaut . Yeah , well , what the hell ? I 'm not gonna have to clean this suit . [ Chuckles ] All right , stop talking and start walking . You waited . - How 's your back ? - Sore beyond words . Which is a good thing . It 's a fitting end to an era . Period at the end of a sentence ? More like a painful exclamation point . - Look - - No . No looks , Donner . No regrets . Aw , just - You and I will always be connected in some ... strange way I can 't explain . Usually involving too many drinks ... and vomit . [ Chuckles ] I 'm wearing my bucket . Well , I was just gonna say that , uh - I hope we stay in touch . - Let me know when you land ? - [ Man On P.A. ] Eastbound express . - Spokane , Fargo , Minneapolis , Chicago . - That 'd be me . That 's a nice trip . I 've taken it before . It 's a nice ride . I had a hard time pulling my eyes away from the window . - Yeah , it 's not a bad planet , is it ? - No . - [ Laughs ] - No , it 's not . - And there are no cows on Venus . - That 's right . Have fun up there , Donner . Sure . [ Maddux ] Zoe ? Zoe , you 're gonna make it back here to me . Zoe , come on . - Hurry . - [ Ted ] She 's a hundred meters out . [ Maddux ] You copy ? I need you to push . - Come on , Zoe . Come on . - Come on . - Go , Zoe . - Come on . [ No Audible Dialogue ] Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on , Zoe . - Go , Zoe . - Go , Zoe . - Go ! - Come on , Zoe ! - Let 's go ! [ Maddux ] Come on . - Fifty meters from the lander . - Go , Zoe . Keep pushing . - [ Alarm Blaring ] - We have a breach in the suit . Left arm servos are failing . - How far out is she ? - Five meters . - Don 't breathe . Get in the cage . - [ Alarm Continues ] [ Suit Motors Straining ] - Zoe , you can 't breathe . Hold your breath . - She 's down . No . No , no , no , no , no . Come on . [ Maddux ] Get up . Get up ! Zoe , get in the cage ! - You are so close . - Come on . Don 't breathe . Get in the cage . She 's in . She 's in . Donner , pull her up . [ Lift Motor Whirring ] - [ Mike ] How bad is the breach ? - Not complete . - Ninety-three centigrade . - Heart still beating . - She still have Gamma ? - Still in her arms . - She 's in . The door 's closed . - Donner , go . Get the hell off that planet . - Roger that . - [ Rumbling ] [ Heartbeat ] - [ Distorted Audio ] - [ Maddux ] Zoe . Zoe ? Zoe ? [ Labored Breathing ] Zoe ? Help me . Let 's - Let 's get her out of the suit and up to the med bay . Zoe ? Zoe , we 're right here , honey . We got you . You 're gonna be okay . You 're gonna be okay . - [ Maddux ] All right , you got her ? - [ Evram ] Let 's get the oxygen . - Surgeon . - [ Jen On Radio ] Stay with us . Thready pulse . Weak B.P. I 'm seeing lung damage . Severe dehydration . Second - and third-degree burns over half of her body . She really shouldn 't be alive . Odds of survival ? I don 't know . - Guess . - Twenty percent . - And another one bites the dust . - Shut up ! - I 'm just saying . - You shut your mouth , Arnel ! I don 't want to hear one more word coming out of it ! Not one ! Do you understand me ? She did it . Can 't you understand that ? Yes , she did . And for those of you who can 't recognize it , that was courage . From both of them . And that is what we aspire to . - [ Droning ] - [ Breathing Heavily ] Okay . [ Continues ] - It 's in . - [ Beeps ] - Wass ? - Yeah . Would you call this a miracle ? As close as I 've ever seen . - [ Paula ] She saw it as a baby in her arms . - Yeah . Maybe it 's some kind of shape-shifter thing . So her memory of the miracle has a baby in it . I see what you 're sayin ' . Subjective , objective . Yeah , I think it 's exactly what you said before . That we see what we wanna see . But it still happened . Or it 's like Zoe 's phony walk on Venus ... and it 's all just a fairy tale . Cameras died . Five different shots , and none of them worked - - Where is everybody ? - [ Paula On TV ] Barnes will now drag her sled - They should 've been off shift an hour ago . ... then go onto the platform ... - Three . That will lift her into the lander . So far , this has been a textbook mission . [ Evram ] Okay , we need to boost saline , dress her burns and get her into the chamber . Jen , I need an epi patch ready in case she arrests . Copy that . [ Grunts ] - You . - Hey , I only did it ' cause she asked me to . - I don 't want trouble . - No . No trouble . Listen . Where can I get a tattoo so that when I 'm in the locker room , nobody can see it ? Only two good places for it , and they both hurt . [ Evram ] Gently . Gently . Good . All right . Nadia . Can I have the dressing , please ? ? [ Acoustic Guitar ] [ Man ] ? Feel I 'm on the verge ? ? Of some great truth ? ? Where I 'm finally in my place ? ? But I 'm fumbling ? ? Still for proof ? ? And it 's cluttering my space ? - Congratulations , Mike . - Thanks . - Thank you . - Eve , congratulations . ? Casting shadows on my face ? ? And know I 'll have the strength to move ahead ? [ Ted ] I cannot say that this delicious crawfish étouffée ... is normal . It is if you 're from New Orleans . Trust me . It 's nice to cook for someone . Well , it 's really nice to be cooked for . You know , wejust - we get so wound up in space , you know ... and things so much greater ... that , uh , sometimes we forget who we are ... and why we do all this . I think it 's important to just bring things down to size . Home and family . To home and family and to - to normal . I guess you must feel , um , pretty good ... vindicated . Yeah . Sure . But part of me was hoping that she would give up and bring you home . Well , I can 't say I haven 't had those same thoughts , you know ? It 's like we 're - we 're moving away from normal . I have this feeling ... that I 'm never gonna taste your crawfish étouffée again . [ Droning ] Mama , I 'm home . - Hector . - [ Barking ] [ Man ] Your mom isn 't here , angel . [ Voice Echoing ] She 'll be home at 5 : 00 . She 'll be home at 5 : 00 . Hmm ! All hail the conquering heroes . Hey , I 'm buying for anyone who can estimate ... exactly how much each ounce of Venus dust cost the taxpayer . [ Laughing ] Oh , come on . Regale me with tales of human conquest . Ajay . Not tonight , Trevor . Just watch the replay . - [ Paula On TV ] ... that were specially designed - - Something happen ? It was a textbook mission . [ Trevor ] All right . Thanks for today . You were really great . - Hey , I had the truck , after all . - Oh , no . No . This was about a lot more than a truck . You came through for Zoe . For me . Yeah , that 's me all right - Mr. Steady . - Do you lie ? - Rarely . Cheat ? No . It 's not my nature . A regular stand-up guy . It 's a way of life . [ Beeping ] Koop Memorial Hospital . Um , yes . I 'm looking for the victim of a hit-and-run accident . She was brought in a couple of nights ago . Blonde woman in her 20s . No , I don 't know her name . I was the driver . [ Monitor Beeping ] Flight surgeon . Private comm , channel 6 . - How 's the vibe ? - A little weird . There is a sense of accomplishment , but no one 's really celebrating . - Not with Zoe in trouble . - She should be dead . Yeah . Adrenaline does strange things . This wasn 't adrenaline . It wasn 't the object . This was too close . The object would have done more . Unless it 's trying to test us - push us to the edge of our capabilities . - Why would it do that ? - Why would God testJob ? Look , we have no idea what these genetic changes are ... or how they influence our bodies . Maybe it 's a helper ... a little booster to get us over the hump . Miracles have explanations . - You 're sure about that ? - I 'm a scientist , not a priest . [ Man 's Voice ] Got you some ice cream . Caramel swirl . You can have some after we play . You 're so shy today . [ Maddux Narrating ] I don 't know where it is you find courage . There isn 't a map . [ Monitor Beeping ] [ Buzzing ] [ Maddux Narrating ] It kind of follows the road of emotion . There . You got your bucket . - [ Beeping ] - [ Paula On TV ] ... to pick up dirt instead of repel it . All Zoe has to do is walk around a little ... and then step on the sled that she 's been towing behind her . [ Maddux Narrating ] Sometimes stopping your conviction and anger . Other times parking beside fear . Paula ? [ Man 's Voice ] I wanna kiss those eyes . [ No Audible Dialogue ] Kiss those eyes . Paula , are you okay ? [ Maddux Narrating ] Courage plays no favorites ... takes no sides . [ Ventilator Hissing ] It can be as impressive as a walk on Venus ... or as simple as a kiss . [ Groans ] Paula . Paula ! - Hector ! Hector , no ! - [ No Audible Dialogue ] - [ Barking ] - [ Screams ] Hector ! - [ Whimpering ] - Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners now and at the hour of death . Amen . Commander Crane ? [ Maddux Narrating ] And sometimes in our darkest hours ... courage is all we have . Paula . He-He 's alive . Mmm . Ahh . English - US - SDH

 Torchwood Outside the Government , beyond the police . Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race . The 21st century is when everything changes ... and Torchwood is ready . Explosive devices ... Snap ! Jack , who 's done this ? Captain John Hart . Jack , what does he want ? Say hi to the family . No , it can 't be . Been a while since you 've seen your brother , eh , Jack ? Gray ? That bastard John 's taken our SUV . Looks like he 's driven it back to Torchwood . I 'm getting readings of rift activity all over the city . Major rift flares at St. Helen 's Hospital , the Police Headquarters and the Central IT Server Station . Hey , Andy ? Gwen , you 've gotta get here right now ! I 'm serious , we need you . Okay , I 'm on my way , all right ? This is him , isn 't it ? This Captain John , or whatever he likes to call himself ? Rhys , drop Owen at the hospital . Tosh , Ianto cover the central server building . Gwen , the police station . Then take me to Torchwood . - Think we 're all gonna fit in here ? - Yeah , we 're gonna have to . Jack , these are traps . So be careful . You know what he 's capable of . What about you ? I 'm gonna go reason with him ! He just tried to kill us . I was the only one who could ever control him . That 's why the Time Agency partnered us . Did you just say Time Agency ? Don 't tell me that 's based in Cardiff too ? Why 's he doing this , Jack ? What does he want ? That 's what I 'm going to go ask him . Come on ! Sing along ! It 's our song ! We don 't have a song . And if we did have a song , it wouldn 't be this song . You 're no fun ! Thank you . I 've been here quite a while , what kept you ? We all survived . You know , if you 're gonna set an explosion , you need to be more efficient . Oh , them , they were just prototypes , had to test out a theory . How are they all , the little team ? What do you want ? I want you to know that I love you . Funny way of showing it . No , seriously . You have to understand . I really do love you . Because this ... is gonna get nasty . Cardiff City Police HQ 5 : 27PM Andy ! They just appeared out of nowhere , across the whole building . They weren 't human , least not like any human I 've ever seen . The station 's in shock . Four most senior officers , murdered . Everyone 's running round like headless chickens . Rhys , what you doing here ? This is a crime scene , and a confidential crime scene at that . If what happened here gets out , there 'll be a citywide panic . Rhys won 't go blabbing . I 'm keeping more secrets than you 'd ever believe . Like what ? Like a Time Agency . Based in Cardiff ! Oh , it 's not based in Cardiff . Brilliant secret ... I ask , you tell , well done . Bloody hell . What are they ? Weevils ... they live in the sewers . Tell me you 're joking . - Don 't mind if I subdue them , do you ? - Be my guest . They killed the four most senior officers . Almost like it was targeted . Tosh , report where you are . Just entering the Central Server . No sign of rift activity yet . This building houses servers for the military , police , NHS , even looks after the server systems for the nuclear station at Turnmill . What problem did they report ? Ghosts in these server stacks . How 's the arm ? Owen gave me industrial strength painkillers , seems to be doing the trick . Ianto . Devils ! Blasphemers ! Pray to your heathen God . While in the Lord 's name , we cast you out ! - There we are then . - Sorted . Owen , it 's Gwen . Do you have anything to report ? We 've got some activity in the basement . Coming back from a fag break , saw the door open and there it is ! Chewing through the cables . So I locked it in . What the hell is it ? Short answer ? It 's an alien . - Alien ? - Yeah . It 's called a Hoix . The only profile we have is that it lives to eat . Doesn 't matter what . Caught one in Barry last year in a kebab shop , it went through seven doner sticks in 20 minutes . Now , have you got the keys ? - What 's that ? - All species sedative . Now , food . You got anything it can eat ? Only these . Right , perfect ! Wish me luck . Hoixie , where are you ? Come on , porkie . Come out , come out , wherever you are . There you are . Look what I 've got . They 're actually very tasty . Get a load of one of these . That 's it , good boy , come to me . Come on , that 's it , try one of these . You really are quite stupid , aren 't you ? Comms and weapons have been removed , in case you were wondering . So no chance of a rescue . - This is a little extreme , don 't you think ? - Oh , what ? Suddenly you 're anti-bondage ? Why are you here ? Well , see ... now you 're interested in me . It 's always the same , nobody cares until you tie them up . Number of reasons , actually . First of all , you were very rude to me . - What ? - Very rude indeed . In front of people who barely knew me . You belittled me . Can 't let that go . You 're serious ? Second ... you have all of time . 143 00 : 07 : 42,450 - - 00 : 07 : 43,820 Eternity , essentially . And you still refused to spend time with me . After all we 've been through together , after all I 've done for you . Where 's Gray ? What 've you done with my brother ? You don 't realize . Actions , ramifications , ripples in the pond . It 's beyond my control . - Beyond your control ? Please ! - It is . You need to understand that , so , localize the rift storms , a few short sharp shocks ... Don 't touch those controls ! Oi , I 'm working here ! If you don 't want that again , keep quiet . So , I think we 're ready to find a vantage point . Whatever you 're planning , we 're gonna stop you . Okay . Go on , then . Stop me . I hope you can , really . No ? All right , let 's go get ourselves a good view . What the hell are we doing here ? This is a good view . I told you , no struggling . I can make things right with you . You don 't understand . You can 't ever make this right . Attention ... Torchwood employees ! Evening all ! - Now , stop what you 're doing . - Jack , what 's going on , are you okay ? Jack can 't come to the comms right now . But if you leave a message , I 'll be sure and pass it along . What 've you done to him ? No , no , wrong question . You should be asking , what am I about to do to you ? - Put Jack on right now ! - Eye Candy ! That was so masterful , so bossy , so basically powerless . Get up to the roofs of your buildings . Quickly now , spit spot . - Why ? - Owen ! Cos if you don 't , you 'll miss all the fun . Hold on a minute , do I mean fun or do I mean carnage ? I get them confused . Are you running yet ? No dawdling now ! Gwen ! Where 's she going ? What 're you doing ? I 'm sorry . Now ... Cardiff ! Isn 't it pretty ? Doesn 't it twinkle so ? Take a good look . Remember this ... because it all goes so quick . Oh , my God ... Gwen ? Oh , God ... You 've destroyed the city . Jack , hold me . Oh , my God What do we do , what do we do ? Okay , keep everyone calm , tell them to get every officer in . RUN ! What 've you done ? It 's okay . It 's all gonna be okay . Stop ! Get off me ! Jack ? Jack ? Jack , can you hear me ? Are you there ? Jack ! I 'm tracking a huge rift flare over at the castle . It 's been generated by the rift manipulator at Torchwood . Tosh , Ianto , Owen ... are you okay ? Yeah , we 're fine . - Still here . - Me too . Good , okay , good . Tosh , do we have the scale of the damage on the city ? Fifteen major explosions , at strategic points across the city . There 's currently a surge in traffic trying to leave the city but the explosions have cut off all major routes in and out . Landlines , mobile phones and IT networks all down , TV and radio off air . - He 's completely crippled us , Gwen . - Shit . Not wanting to be the harbinger of doom , but the systems which serve the nuclear plant have all gone off-line . Tosh , Ianto , you have to stabilise the nuclear power station , make that a priority . Owen , what 's it like at the hospital ? Lost all power . The backup generators gave out in the blast . Every single machine in this hospital is down . It 's a disaster . Okay , all of you , listen to me . We 're gonna fix this , and we 're gonna put this city back together , we 're gonna find Jack and we 're gonna punish John . Now , I need you to be careful . Okay ? Where are you , Jack ? Where are you ? We 're safe . Now , before you do anything rash , you have to hear ... Take us back now ! No way . We have to be this far to escape the trigger signal ! What ? Look at it ! Go on . It 's bonded to my skin . I can 't get it off . Open it . Ninth generation detonator . You 're a walking bomb ! Add to that a surveillance circuit , to monitor my every word and action , and he has me doing anything I 'm told . Cos if I don 't ... boom ! I 'm not my own man . I thought you 'd see that . No , you 're so self-obsessed you thought I 'd want to blow up the stupid city ! When I could be experiencing seventeen simultaneous pleasures in the Lotus Nebula ! Oh , no . Just run . Oh , please , that is the oldest trick in the book . Jack ? Gray ? - I never stopped believing . - Gray , where are you ? I always knew we 'd find each other again . I 'm sorry . Sorry 's not good enough . Get a shovel . This was a targeted attack , designed to cause maximum panic . Usual emergency procedures won 't cover what 's happened here . This is where we find out how good we really are . Cover the whole city , knock on doors , check on people , tell people that they are safe and that it is being dealt with . Get out there and do your jobs . - Bloody impressive , mate . - She is that , yeah . Lucky sod . Go ! It won 't work ! Nothing , sorry . We need to re-start the Turnmill servers . What if you can 't ? - Then the reactor goes into meltdown . - Then I 'm going up there . What ? Ianto ! Look , if we can 't fix the remote servers , there must be something I can do on-site to prevent nuclear meltdown . That could be suicide . Are we gonna discuss it , or are we gonna do it ? Okay , but we both go . I looked for you . I searched for you for years . You were my first thought , every day . What are you expecting ? A loving reunion ? Absolution ? Me to say , " It 's okay , brother , I forgive you . " Take Gray and keep him safe . I got to go get your mother . Run ! Those creatures , they lived to torture . They kept us just on the verge of life . I 'd lie there , hemmed in by corpses , praying to become one . Because you ... let go ... of my hand , remember ? If I could swap with you , I would . Gray . Gray ! Where 's Gray ? Where is he , son ? Where is he ? Gray ! - Remember it again . - Gray , where are you ? I believed you 'd come , but you never did . How long before you gave up , hm ? Months ? Years ? Decades ? What do you want from me ? I want you to suffer . I want your life . This is Cardiff . 27AD . The city will be built here , over the next 2,000 years . Your grave will be the city 's foundations . Your blessing of life becomes a curse . Each time you revive , with a throatful of earth , each time it chokes you afresh , and you thrash on the edge of death , you think of me . All right , calling a halt now I can 't let you do this . - Fill the grave . - No way . Then the detonator on your arm gets activated . What 's that ? It 's , er , sentimental value . Skulking , is it ? Still no word from Jack . Hey , it 's gonna be fine . What if it 's not ? What if this is how it all ends ? I can 't do this , Rhys . I 'm not up to it . Rubbish . Those coppers are out there now , because of you . Even if you don 't believe in yourself , they did . And I do . You 're a bloody hero , Gwen . So you keep going , cos we need you . Will you marry me again ? Gwen , I 've got a rift alert from inside the Hub , mirroring the pattern from earlier when Jack disappeared . D 'you think it could be him ? I can 't check it out , I 've got to get the Turnmill servers back online . Tosh , I can 't leave the police station . Yes , you can . If they need you . We 'll be fine . Are you sure ? I 'll see you when it 's all over . Go ! You took your time . On your knees ! Honestly , it 's just sex , sex , sex with you people ! Now ! Hands behind your head ! I 'm gonna need a really good reason not to shoot you within the next 20 seconds . I know where Jack is . You 're lying . He 's buried alive , somewhere beneath this city . I came back to help you . You bombed this city ! Listen to me ! You have to believe me . It 's Gray , Jack 's brother , that 's been doing all this . Don 't talk rubbish . He placed a bomb on me , molecularly bonded the detonator to my skin , I had to do what he wanted . Look ! He forced me to bury Jack and then he freed me , he told me I could go anywhere I wanted . I could 've run , but I chose to come back here . Why should I trust you ? They were separated as children . Gray was abducted . When I found him he was chained to the ruins of a city in the Bedlam Outlands ... surrounded by corpses . He was the only one left . The creatures had long since gone . Dunno how long he 'd been there . He thought I was the rescuing hero . So , it took me too long to realize he 'd learned terrible things watching those creatures . He let me trust him ... The molecules are unbonding . Just like he promised . Oh , God . See ? Free man . Apparently . I didn 't have to come back here . I could 've run . You find Jack , I 'll let you live . - But you 'd better be quick . - Fine . Toshiko . I need you to run a trace for an etheric particle signal NME transmitting at 200 betacycles . Gwen , where are you ? What 's he doing ? Where 's Jack ? Trace that signal , we 'll find him . It 's okay , Tosh . I 've got him covered . Just do as he says . No signals even vaguely resembling that . There must be . That transmitter 's guaranteed for five millennia through three permalayers , it has to still be transmitting . If not , we 'll never find him . He 'll be buried ... forever . What the hell is that ? Oh , there 's weevils loose in the lower corridors . Stay there , stay there . Oh , my God , what 's going on , how did they get out ? It 's Gray . He must be here in the city , he said he was gonna take Jack 's life , destroy it from the inside out . A weevil wake-up call could be just the beginning . Owen , Gwen , can you hear me ? The streets are flooded with weevils , they came out of nowhere . There 's no chance we 'll get to the nuclear power station in time . Manual life support , get them round the hospital . Ianto , leave it to me . - I can get there . - How ? King of the Weevils , remember ? Push , will you ! Have none of you ever been in a scrum ! Bloody hell , how many were there ? It 's like Fort Apache the Bronx . Apart from the fact that there are savage aliens and we could all die , it 's almost exactly the same , yeah . Thanks for that . I am telling you I have run every scan possible , there is no signal traceable . Then try it again , it 's got to be there . Oi , I 'm talking to you . You know you 've got a real pest problem around here . Oh , God , I 'm so pleased to see you ! Don 't start , I 'll make things right , Eye Candy . Then start by getting those Weevils down the vaults before they recover . It takes more than a bullet to stop them . - You did what ? - Ianto ! - I didn 't have a choice ! - There 's always a choice . Okay , can we just get these Weevils into the cells , please ! If we don 't find him , I 'll kill you . Very slowly . What 's happening ? Tosh ? Tosh ! Ianto , my comms are dead . Gwen ? I let you go . I gave you one trip , you could have gone anywhere . Question of honour . Gray ? You 're Gray , right ? There 's no need for this , we can help you . Just tell us where Jack is . His life 's mine now . Where 's Jack ? What 've you done with him ? What the hell are you doing ? Get the hell out of here ! What the hell are you doing here , is more like it ! The systems going into meltdown . A soldier never leaves her post . Well you can now , okay ? I 'm with Torchwood and we 're dealing with this . Yeah ? What d 'you know about nuclear containment structure ? Well , I 'm only a lineman , but I 'm presuming if you 've run out of power , then the containment structure is over pressurised . The containment spray and cooling systems aren 't working so the fuel probably can 't be cooled down , it 's overheating . So sooner rather than later , there 'll be a meltdown and radioactive material will be released into the atmosphere . Yeah ? - Roughly ? - Roughly . Right . You need to go . Be careful . There are creatures are there who are lose . Take this . It 's a kind of maze . It sounds more dangerous out there than in here . Yeah , I 'd say it 's pretty much even . Go . Thank you . Tosh , you 're going to have to help me out here . I haven 't got a bloody clue of what I 'm doing . Okay ... I don 't want you to panic , but the reactor has already hit the critical point . Okay , you 're telling me it 's gone into meltdown , aren 't you ? And I 'm at the eye of the storm . Yeah , sorry . Right . Can you fix it ? - Of course I can , I 'm brilliant ! - Yeah . I 'm going to try and divert power from an auxiliary source back to Turnmill . If that works , I can talk you through restoring the coolant system . Right , now ... Tosh ! Help me ... please . Tosh ? Are you there ? I 've heard people say , death is such a waste . I imagine it more as a relief . Tosh , do you hear me ? Tosh ! What 's it like ? How does it feel ? Are you afraid ? Are you sad ? You can tell me . The battle is done . What 's that ? Tosh , talk to me ! I need you help here , babe ! - What 's that banging ? - Something 's wrong . Nevermind that , I have an idea . I forgive you . How did you survive ? How long since you first discovered it ? 3 days now . Just one signal , regular as clockwork . But I haven 't told you the best bit , I can track it to a physical location . Where ? It 's here . 20 feet down , but it 's definitely here . Start digging . Please , can we just stop with the questions ? We found you in a 20-foot grave . - Do you want us to just accept that ? - Yes , I do . You supposed to be out there working for us . Who gave you this ring ? I have crossed my own timeline . I can 't be allowed to meet myself , a lot of lives depend on this . You 'll be protecting the future . That 's what you 're here for , isn 't it ? And now I need you to put me in the morgue . Freeze me , set the alarm to defrost in 107 years time . I forgive you , Gray . Don 't you walk away from me . Don 't you walk away from me ! Stop ... stop ! I 've forgiven you ! I give you absolution . - Now do the same for me ! - I pray for death ! Those creatures , the things they did to us , because if you ... the favourite son . The one who lived , who 'll always live . The only strength I have , is my hatred for you . I didn 't know . I didn 't realize until it was too late . I begrudge you everything . I want to rip it all from you , to leave you screaming in the dark . I will never resolve you . All of it , it 's your fault . I know . I know , Gray . Got it . - Sorry . - What 've you done ? Recall signal . Time for all the pests to return home . What happend ? Where 've they all gone ? Abergavenny ? Tosh ! Come on , girl . Here we go ! All right , you 've done it , Tosh . We 've got power . - You okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Right , what 's going on there ? Just a ... machine malfunction . - Are you hurt ? - Who me ? No . - I 'm fine . It 's just my arm . - Okay . - I 'm sorting ' out another painkiller . - Good . Okay . Come on , let 's do this thing . - Owen ... - What is it , love ? There 's no way to stop the meltdown . It 's too far gone . Okay , that is not good , is it ? But some on , Tosh . There 's got to be something , there 's allways something . The only option now is to vent the flow channels internally . Vent them where ? The area you are in , there 's a containment building . Yeah . Well , instead of the redundancy program channel the fuel into that bunker and instigate permanent lockdown . Seal the building and the meltdown will be contained within . And obviously , remember to get out . Yeah , I think I can remember that bit . I 'll open the system protocol . You just need to enter the timeframe and authorize it . Okay , Tosh . Let 's do this thing . And , er , Tosh ... thank you . That 's what I 'm here for . Jack ! Thank , God ! - We thought we lost you . - Never ... never . Quite a que for the hugs . Always has been , always will be . Nice use of the ring . Thank you . It 's the least I could do . - Listen , Gray is in the Hub . - I know . It 's done . Yes ! Rock 'n'roll ! Owen ... Owen , get out of there ! There 's a power surge in the system ! When that hits , it 'll trigger an emergency lockdown ! No ! Tosh ! Toshiko , I can 't get out ! Not like this ! I 'm not dying here ! Get me out of here , Tosh ! Get me out of here ! I 've died once , I 'm not doing it again ! Where 's Jack ? Where 's Gwen , Ianto , John ? You want to watch the dead man die again ? ! - Owen , just stay calm . - Oh , why should I do that ? Where 's the fun in that ? ! I 'm gonna rage my way to oblivion . - Please stop . - Why ? Give me one good bloody reason why ! One good reason why I shouldn 't keep screaming ! Because you 're breaking my heart . I 'm sorry . It 's my fault . No , no , no , it isn 't . No , it isn 't , love . Don 't you dare go there , Tosh . I 'm really sorry . What 's gonna happen to me , Tosh ? I can 't ... Please . Okay , I need to know . The containment chamber will be flooded with the irradiated coolant . Ah , my body will slowly decompose , as I watch . - I should 've been able to stop it . - Shh . Come on , Tosh . There 's no way you could 've anticipated that power spike , come on . Besides , you 've saved my back so many times in the past . Right from the moment I joined . Your second week I had to cover for you , pretend I was a medic , cos you were hung over and unreachable . What was it , Space Pig ? - Space Pig . - Yeah . We never did get that date , did we , you and me ? We sort of , er , missed each other . It was my fault . I didn 't ... notice until it was too late . I 'm sorry . Me too . It 's starting . Owen ... It 's all right . Really , Tosh . It 's all right . Oh , God . Owen ... Owen ... Toshiko ? Toshiko ? Gwen , I need help down here ! The nuclear plant at Turnmill . Owen 's there . Sealed in . I re-routed the blast . Couldn 't save him . Tosh ? There you go , darling . Talk to me now , come on . Hey , Tosh ! And Cardiff city centre is today recovering from a series of devastating explosions . City leaders say it 's too early to account for the full scale of the damage that also saw sightings of vicious animals on the streets of the city . My whole life I was looking for him . Now I have to lose him all over again . You cryo-freeze him and then what ? Wake him up in a 100 years and he 's miraculously better ? Cos that 's not gonna happen . Maybe killing him would be the release he needs . There has been enough death . You didn 't struggle ... when I buried you . Like ... you were allowing it . It was my penance . It 's not your fault . Need help with those rift predictions ? Lot of this planet I haven 't seen . You like it so much , thought I might take a look . Maybe see you around . I 'm sorry for your losses . Okay . So ... if you 're seeing this , I guess it means , I 'm ... well , dead . Hope it was impressive ! Not crossing the road or an incident with a toaster . I just wanted to say ... it 's okay . It really is . Jack , you saved me . You showed me all the wonders of the universe and ... all those possibilities . And I wouldn 't have missed it for the world . Thank you . And Owen , you never knew ... I love you . All of you . And ... I hope I did good . Now we carry on . I don 't think I can , not after this . You can . We all can . The end is where we start from .

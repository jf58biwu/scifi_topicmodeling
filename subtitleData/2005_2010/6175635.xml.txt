 Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future . The 21st century is when everything changes . And you 've gotta be ready . Okay , come on . Okay , you asked for this . Coming over the top . Gwen , this is for you , baby . Let 's go , baby . Let 's go . Just get it off him . Take it out of his hands . Oh , come to Daddy . Yeah ! First round 's on you , boss . Girls , get your handbags . - Of course , that was an illegal move . - Totally illegal . Yeah . Keep telling yourself that , yeah ? Losers . Bye ! Whatever . - He 's never seen a live rugby match . - I have other things to do with my time . Rhys knows a bloke whose cousin works at the Millennium Stadium . We should all go to the next home international . Can you make it two pepperoni feasts tonight ? And a tub of coleslaw . My boss says I 'm not eating enough vegetables . Yup . Usual time . See you then . Good to see you again , sir . How are they looking after you at the hotel ? I did all I could . I really did . My God . It 's not possible . One of them survived . This is Lisa . - Is she awake ? - It 's just a reaction to the medication . She 's the only one left across the whole world . Thank you . Thank you so much . Bringing me here . I never thought to get my chance ... to study , to work with ... - anything like this . - Anyone . Tell me , what happened ? She worked for Torchwood London . It was the end of the Canary Wharf battle . The Cybermen needed soldiers fast . They started upgrading whole bodies instead of transplanting brains , using Earth technology . Lisa was halfway through the process when the machinery shut down . You found her ? Please ! Somebody ! - I pulled her out . - Do you know the percentages ? The what ? Some elements have been augmented . Some are still human . Sensory capacity , for instance . Her breathing and hearing appears completely cybernetic , and yet , there 's also bare flesh . Amazing . Perhaps 5 5 % augmentation , with 45 % awaiting completion . Do you think ? Or perhaps maybe 60-40 . - It 's fascinating ! - Can you make her human again ? You took parts from a cyber conversion unit and modified them into a life support for her . - How did you know what to do ? - I told him . I thought you were resting . You should be resting . How 's the pain ? Are the new doses working ? A little . - Is this him ? - I promised , didn 't I ? - And you always keep your promises . - I would like to ask her some questions . My name is Doctor Tanizaki . I specialize in cybernetics . Your friend , Mr Jones , asked me ... My boyfriend . Yes . He asked me to come . We agreed . Together . A few simple questions . - What is your name ? - Lisa Hallett . - How old are you ? - Twenty-six . What is the last thing you remember before coming here ? Pain . I remember my body burning with pain . You said there was somewhere I could work upstairs . This first stage should enable her to breathe without the respirator . Once her body functions without support , I can judge what work is needed . What if she 's not ready to breathe on her own ? You must be prepared for her not to survive . Sometimes in order to save what we love , we have to risk losing it . - She 's not strong enough ! - Let me do my work ! And she said , " Do you know how difficult it is to find a man in this city ? " He had a nice flat , all his own hair , so frankly , a couple of tusks I can live with . " Ianto 's mate . UFO sighting over Cardigan Bay . Seven calls to emergency services . - Can we at least finish our drinks , please ? - Sure . Take 10 seconds . If she dies because of you ... - Ianto ? - Yes . I 'm here . She 's breathing . It worked ! - Why aren 't I connected ? - You 're alive ! He kept you alive ! - Thank you . - This is only the start . We 've got to move . Quickly ! I 'll walk . - You 've only just woken up . You can 't ! - I want to walk . Please . Help her downstairs . I 'll clear up here . I 'm alive . All I 'm saying is , once in a while , I 'd like to drive . - And all I 'm saying is no . - Why not ? I 've shared cars with women before . I know what will happen . There 'll be an emergency , we 're all raring to go , I jump in , what do I find ? Seat 's in the wrong position , the rear-view mirror 's out of line . The steering wheel 's in my crotch . In the time it takes to sort it all out , aliens will have taken Newport . What about a rota ? Different people drive on different days . We 're a secret organization hunting alien technology from an underground base , and you want a rota for who drives . Just trying to help . As soon as they 're gone , I 'll be down . Tosh , call up the radar within a 50-mile radius of the bay for the last six hours . Gwen , check with that man , Neil I think his name was , voice like Sean Connery , at Jodrell Bank . See if they picked up any chatter around the time of the sightings . Owen , access the airspace provision over Cardigan Bay . Also any RAF flight plans , see if it 's just a case of mistaken identity . Take it slowly . You are still very weak . This way . Is that Neil ? It 's Gwen Cooper from Torchwood . I know . We 're always after something , aren 't we ? Ianto ! Would you work some coffee magic ? Lisa ! Let me go ! I can help you . The human race is weak . I can make you strong . - What 's happening ? - Internal power drain . - What 's causing it ? - Something big to drain that amount of power . Tosh , run a system diagnostic . Actually , we 've been having generator problems all evening . I was down there checking earlier . A couple of bits of cabling have come loose . I thought I 'd fixed it . - Let me have another look . - Fine . Go check . - Want some help ? - I 'm fine . We 've got to shut down the power ! - Oh , God . Oh , my God ! What happened ? - His upgrade failed . Was it an accident ? Tell me you didn 't do this . I wanted to repay him for helping me by removing the weaknesses of his humanity . What have you done ? You 've killed an innocent man . It 's all right . It 's not all right ! They 're going to come looking for me in a minute . If they see the body , if they find out what we 've been doing ... - I can deal with them . - Don 't you go near them ! You didn 't mean to do this . Something 's happened to your mind . Um , just ... Some kind of side effect from this whole process . It 's post-traumatic . You didn 't mean it . You 've ruined everything now ! How hard have we had to work to keep you alive ? And now you do this . I need you to stay in here . Rest . Don 't come out unless I tell you . This can 't happen again , Lisa . If you harm anyone else , I 'll ... Yes ? What will you do ? Okay , the body . I 've got to deal with the body . I can do this . This is my fault . I am responsible for this . I 'll hide the body . Everything 's going to be okay . - That 's a UFO ? - Only just . Arkan leisure crawler . First generation . Collector 's item . Don 't see many of those around these days . Tosh , send a polite message saying , " Great to see them , but could they please get the hell out of our atmosphere ? - " They 're spooking the locals . " - Done . Shouldn 't we be apprehending it ? Investigating it ? Oh , please . You interrogate an Arkan , you 'll be in there for a month . And that 's just the first question . They are so boring . Besides , they 're mostly made of liquid . The cells would be a mess . There it goes again . Ianto , we 've got another dose of darkness . You find anything ? Ianto , I need to hear those beautiful Welsh vowels . Power 's draining to the storeroom at the bottom of the building . I 'm looking for human heat signals . - We 've got ... - Two signals . - So assuming one 's Ianto ... - Who 's the other ? I 'm thinking we 're under attack . Security 's been breached . - We assume battle protocols . - That 's impossible . Nobody can get in without tripping seven separate alarms . Yeah ? Well , looks like our system needs to be upgraded . I 'll head down and look for Ianto . - I 'll come with you . - You all right with that ? Keep your comms open at all times . Any doubt , shoot first . The priority is to find Ianto . I 'm sorry . - What 's down here ? - Normally ? Nothing . - Progress report . - Signs of activity in ... We 're losing your comm signals . We 're going in to have a look . Whatever that power source is , it 's interfering with the comms . Gwen , Owen , can you hear me ? Damn ! Can we get them back ? I 'm trying other channels . There 's something else you need to see . I 've gone back through our internal CCTV footage for the last couple of hours . Someone 's tried to remove the images from our system . See , now I 'm starting to get a little peeved . These people come into my house , start using my things ... I 've dug into the system memory . What the hell 's going on here ? Jack . Tosh . Gwen , Owen , can you hear me ? - No comms . - We 're on our own , then . What the hell is going on ? - What 's the matter ? - Can 't see well enough . There 's something in there . There 's some kind of operating table . Get the bolts . - Okay ? - Yup . Okay . One , two ... - Oh , no , no , no . - What the hell is it ? It 's wrong . It 's beyond wrong . It shouldn 't be here . Turn the thing off . Turn it off ! - Internal levels are being restored . - Gwen , Owen , can you hear me ? These things brought down Torchwood One . They were all destroyed . - Why is there one in our bloody basement ? - Just tell me what it does . It 's the remnants of a conversion unit . This machinery turns humans into Cybermen . If I don 't hear something within 30 seconds , I 'm coming down there . Jack , it 's Gwen . The comms dropped out . We 're back on-line now . - Any sign of Ianto ? - No . But we have found parts of a cyber conversion unit , fully powered up and working . - This is no time to be kidding around , Owen . - I 'm deadly serious . I don 't know why it 's here or how it got here , but that 's what 's draining our power . - Jack , are you there ? - I want you two back up here immediately . We still haven 't ... Jack . Code zero incursion . Repeat , code zero incursion . We 're under attack . If you don 't hear from me within 1 5 minutes , activate total shutdown procedures and get yourself to safety . But I can 't just leave you all here ! If there 's a Cyberman in this building , we need a last line of defense . Just make sure it never gets to the outside world . Whatever you ... Whoever you are , I don 't mean you any harm , but come any closer , I 'll shoot . Let me go . Do not struggle . You will be like me . Throw down your weapons . Put your hands up and turn and face me ! - You 're a woman ! - Owen ! Jack ! - You don 't know what you 're doing ! - You are fighting the wrong guy ! Get me out of here someone , please ! - Switch it off ! - I 'm trying ! She 's jammed the circuits . Shut off the power everywhere ! Toshiko , cut off the power in the base ! If I do that , the base goes into lock down . We 'll be trapped ! Just do it ! Switch it off ! Do it ! - Gwen ? - I 'm fine . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Sort of . Jack , please get me out of here . It 's all right . Where is she ? Where did she go ? Please tell me you got her . Stand guard by the door . I 'm sorry . - I 'm really sorry . - What for ? Let 's just get out of here . - Clear ? - Clear . There she is . What is she ? Some form of Cyberman . They 're us , upgraded . Humans with emotions removed , created on a parallel world that 's supposedly destroyed on this one . - What are we going to do ? - I don 't know . She 's gone . - Get us back to the Hub . - Jack , what are you doing ? Resisting the urge to shoot . Tosh ! Get everything from the weapons room . Fast as you can ! - It 's locked down . There 's no manual override . - Just open the store ! On your knees . Hands above your head . Jack , for God 's sake , what are you doing ? Tosh ! I gave you an order ! Gwen , help her . - Did you know that thing was down there ? - I put her there . You hid a Cyberman within Torchwood , and you didn 't tell us ? - What else are you keeping from us ? - Like you care . I clear up your shit . No questions asked and that 's the way you like it . When did you last ask me anything about my life ? Her name 's Lisa . She 's my girlfriend . Why didn 't you tell us ? We could have helped you . Torchwood exists to destroy alien threats . Why would I tell you about her ? - A little loyalty , perhaps ? - My loyalty 's to her . She worked for Torchwood . She was caught up in battle . I owe it to Lisa . We owe it to her to find a cure . Ianto , you have to believe me . There is no cure . There never will be . Those who are converted stay that way . - Your girlfriend will not be the exception . - You can 't know that for sure . Look , you need to know what 's happening here because this is where these things start . Small decisions that become mass slaughter . These creatures regain a foothold by exploiting human weakness . Then they take a base , rebuild their forces , and before you know it , the cyber race is spreading out across the universe , erasing worlds , assimilating populations , all because of the tiny beginnings here . We need to stop her . Together . You 're not listening to me . The conversion was never completed . She already tried to kill Gwen . You think she 's going to stop there ? - There is no turning back for her now . - I 'm not giving up on her . I love her . Can you understand that , Jack ? Haven 't you ever loved anyone ? You need to figure out whose side you 're on here , because if you don 't know , you 're not going make it out of this alive . There 's no way this weapons store is going to open . It 's going to take six hours for the power to come back on-line . Let me talk to her . I can still save her , save all of us . She 's not a monster . - Ianto ! - Lisa . - It 's me . - You can 't just let him go ... The army will be rebuilt from here . This building is suitable . - Who are you ? - Human .2 . No ! - Lisa ! - So how come you look like Human .1 ? - I do not understand . - Look at yourself . Go ahead . Remember , Lisa . Remember who you are . - The upgrade is incomplete . - You 're still human . I am ... disgusting . I have ... I am ... wrong . - We can help you . - I must start again . Upgrade properly . For God 's sake , have you heard yourself ? Lisa , please . I brought you here to heal you so we could be together . Together . Yes . Transplant my brain into your body . The two of us together , fused . We 'll be one complete person . Isn 't that what love is ? No . Then we are not compatible . Code nine maneuvers ! Go ! Wait ! Gwen , get out of there ! Lisa ! What are you waiting for ? Gwen ! Run . We all ran . - She 's coming after us . - Well , there 's a surprise . - Could you be any less helpful ? - Oi ! I just helped you escape . Shut up , both of you ! Okay , now , this is a fight to the death . We do whatever is necessary to destroy her . Forget what Ianto said . That thing is not human . Clear ? - Yeah . - Yeah . - What 's this ? - Something Suzie scavenged last year . She claimed that it could open any lock in 45 seconds . I want you out the exit gates , up the emergency stairs to the reception . She 'll never open that door without power . It weighs a ton . - Anyway , I 'm not leaving you here . - Just do as I say . All of you ! Once in reception , panel next to the desk , pull it out . Take circuit 357 from the main system . Patch it to these . There should be enough power in there for what we need . Once the main circuit goes live , get out . Meet us by the water tower . Go ! You two , find anything that even resembles a weapon . Autopsy Room . There should be some lethal equipment there . - What are you going to do ? - Buy you some more time . Go ! Hey ! Lisa . It is Lisa , isn 't it ? You 've been hiding in my basement . That 's okay . Draining my power , I can live with that . But now you 're starting to hurt my friends , this is going to stop . Come on . This building belongs to me now . You will all be deleted . I 'm sorry for what they did to you , but this ends here . Jack ! - How did he survive that ? - Is that all you got ? I 'm not so easily deleted . We can 't help him . Come on . Shit . - Is there another exit ? - No . We 're trapped . - Get in . - No way . - Lie on top of me and it 'll take us both . - I am not lying on top of you . I 'm not saying it 's a brilliant idea , but it 's the only one we 've got . What do we do ? Turn it off . - Where is it ? Where is it ? - It 's in my pocket . Quick ! Turn the thing off . Turn it off ! All right , lover ? It 's the man of your dreams . I 've had a couple of beers with Dav , and we 're off for a curry , so can you video Wife Swap ? Don 't you touch her ! What the hell was that ? - What ? - Snogging me . Last kiss for the condemned man . Little embarrassing given we haven 't been killed . - What ? It 's not like I fancy you or anything . - I was on top of you . I could feel your hard-on . Yeah , well , you didn 't exactly struggle , did you ? It was kill or be killed . Owen 's right . There was no choice . Ianto , move . Get out . Get out , I said ! Move ! Move ! - You should be dead . - I 'm the stubborn type . Get behind me . 357 , 357 . Come on ! That 's right . Stay back . This 'll at least give you heartburn . The power will run out . I can wait . - Jack , help her . Give her a chance to surrender . - Have you not seen what she 's done ? Let her stay in the cells . We can help reverse the process . I 've told you , we 're past that ! Hold him back . - What are you going to do ? - Don 't ask questions . Just get him on there and hold him . - What is that stuff ? - A kind of barbecue sauce . - It helps it identify its food . - Help what identify its food ? I 'm sorry . - Come on , Tosh , hurry up . - You 'll kill her ! Let me go ! Let me help her ! Yes ! - Have a nice day . - No ! Go and help her . You can do that . Have some fucking mercy ! No ! It worked ! - What happened to ... - Don 't . - Oi . - You could have saved her ! You 're worse than anything locked up down there . One day I 'll have a chance to save you and I 'll watch you suffer and die . It was the only thing that would stop her ! Listen , when I was at reception , I managed to trip the lock down timer . The power should be coming back on any second . We could get back in . Ianto ! Pizza . Ianto ? Bloody hell . Ianto ? Do you want these or not ? - Ianto , stop ! - She can 't have survived that attack . I used my initiative . I 'm sorry ! When I want you to think for yourself , I 'll tell you . Maybe if you 'd told me your plan , I wouldn 't have done it . Ianto , don 't be stupid . - I have nothing left to lose . - There 's always something left to lose . I 'm going back in to save her . Anybody tries to stop me , I 'll shoot them . Ianto , put the gun down . You make a threat like that , you 'd better be prepared to follow it through . See ? You disobey me now , I really will shoot you . Get off me . You want to go back in there ? You go in to finish the job . If she 's still alive , you execute her . - No way . - You brought this down on us . You hid her . You hid yourself from us . Now it 's time for you to stand as part of the team . Jack . The girl you loved has gone . Your loyalty is to us now . - You can 't order me to do that . - You execute her , or I 'll execute you both . I won 't do it . You can 't make me . You like to think you 're a hero , but you 're the biggest monster of all . I 'm giving you 1 0 minutes , then we 're coming in . Pick it up . - How can you ask him ... - I don 't need your opinion . Lisa ! Ianto ? Ianto , it 's me . It 's Lisa . I 'm human again . You fought so hard for me , I had to hold on for you so I took this body and transplanted the brain . You 're not Lisa . You always said you didn 't love me for what I looked like . Last time you said that , it was a Saturday . We were hungover . You made cheese toasties and moaned I hadn 't descaled my kettle . That night we camped on a beach in Brittany . It got so freezing , we wore our coats and shared one sleeping bag . When we woke up the next morning , a dog was pissing on our tent . Hold me , Ianto . I need you to hold me . I need you to tell me it 's all right . What are you doing ? Ianto , it 's me . You wouldn 't shoot me . I did this for you . I 'm sorry . Lisa . We can be upgraded together . - You would never have shot him . Not really . - Wouldn 't I ? Would you have shot me if I 'd gone to stand by him ? - But you didn 't . - If I had , though ... But you didn 't . Will he stay ? All that deception because he couldn 't bear to live without her . So have you ever loved anyone that much ? When she had hold of you , I thought ... Just for a moment , I thought maybe you could die after all . - Want to know a secret ? - Mmm-hmm . So did I. And just for a second there , I felt so alive . Are you kidding me ? They 're here . If that 's them , we have to find them before all hell breaks loose . It 's little girls . It 's the little bodies . No one can hurt me . They protect their own . The chosen ones . - Are you saying our machines can 't pick them up ? - Nothing can . She was beautiful . I loved her at first sight . It 's going crazy . No ! This means these creatures can invade my life whenever they feel like it , and I am scared , Jack . For the sake of the world , this is our only chance .

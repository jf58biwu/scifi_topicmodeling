 The world will have to deal with us . Previously on The 4400 : I took the shot . I 'm fine . Mom , what 's wrong ? Someone help . Please . Mom . Isabelle 's in Promise City . As soon as she gets close to Collier , she 'll move . - She knows not to damage him . - For a while , - I believed you 'd changed . - So did I. We 're not gonna make you a martyr to your cause , Jordan . We 're gonna make you a traitor to it . Once you 're marked , you 're gonna destroy the movement you created . I don 't know what lessons you took in bodysnatching school , but you make a terrible Tom Baldwin . If we wanna kill that thing inside him , we 're gonna have to kill Tom too . - Don 't make me shoot . - Are you gonna fix me ? - Going to get your old Tom back ? - Goddamn it , Tom . Stop . Oh , my God . Tom ? He pulled a gun . I had to fire . Where 's Shawn ? - He 's in the car . - Get him . We can 't do it here . He 's in bad shape . We have to move him . Tom ? Tom ? Tom ? Uncle Tommy ? I need to heal him now . He 's losing blood too fast . Not yet . That 's not Tom . We need to get rid of that thing inside of him first . - Everybody out . - Here 's the polonium . You need to inject it directly into his spine . I can 't lie to you , Tom . This is gonna hurt . But it 's gonna kill that thing inside you . Tom ? Tom ? She became apneic and we lost pulse . Mom ? Mom ? Is she dead ? Is my mom dead ? We don 't know yet . Sir , you need to let us work . You can wait inside . You did everything you could . I think you need to prepare yourself for some bad news . - Your mom 's a textbook case . - Textbook case of what ? - Promicin death . - No . She landed on the wrong side of fifty-fifty . No , my mom didn 't take the shot . Are you okay ? Sir ? Sir ? Sir ? Are you okay ? Help . Wait , sir . One of the paramedics is down . Let 's bring out a gurney . Anderson , over here . Come on , Uncle Tommy . Goddamn it . I can 't . It 's too late . Tom ? I think I killed people . I think I killed people , Diana . We can talk about that later . Right now , you need to rest , okay ? I don 't know what happened . I was just talking . He collapsed . Kind of like what happened with my mom . Mr. Farrell , I need some information . Do you know who your mother 's insurance carrier is ? No . Ma 'am ? Ma 'am ? Oh , my God . Ma 'am . Can we get a doctor over here ? I need a doctor . I need a doctor here now . Somebody help . Come on . I need a doctor ! Somebody . Somebody help . - Roll her on her side . - Are you all right ? Tom , what happened ? I can barely remember anything . The few things I do , they 're all ... They 're all bad . How am I supposed to live with what I did ? How can I be positive that thing is gone ? Well , we 're gonna watch over you until we 're sure . You 're gonna recover yourself . And when you do , you 'll tell us who the Marked are . All of them . And after that whatever you did , we 'll deal with it . Okay ? Nobody 's getting into or out of Saint Ambrose . Seattle police have it under strict quarantine and we have tactical agents reinforcing them . No one knows exactly what happened in there yet . I managed to get on the phone with a doctor who 's trapped inside . And he has personally seen dozens of deaths . How is that possible ? There 's no way all those people took the shot . Maybe someone 's going around injecting patients . Like an orderly or a doctor . No . It would take time to force a shot on those people . - This is spreading way too fast . - What if it 's a virus ? Someone took the shot . And the ability they developed is to spread promicin like ... - I don 't know , the flu ? - God . If that 's true , we have more than a bunch of victims on our hands . Fifty-fifty . For every one who died in that hospital , someone else survived . Someone who 's gonna develop a brand-new ability . How many people do you think are trapped inside that hospital ? Five hundred ? - A thousand ? - Well , whatever the number , we 'll deal with it . At least there haven 't been reports of deaths outside the hospital . Area around Saint Ambrose remains cordoned off by police . - Shawn . - Yeah . - Your brother Danny is outside . - Tell him to come in . I can 't . He 's out in the gardens and he won 't come inside . It 's a little strange , to be honest . He 's not letting anybody near him . Danny ? Danny , hey . What 's going on here ? You 're making everybody nervous . Everyone 's dying , Shawn . Everyone around me is dying . - What are you talking about ? - In that hospital . I killed all those people . Danny , what do you mean ? How ? What ? It 's the shot . My ability . I think I 'm infecting people with promicin . And I don 't know what to do . I 've been hiding out all night in a park and I can 't even turn myself in without making more people sick . Okay , you can 't infect anyone who 's already promicin-positive , right ? I don 't think so . You 're gonna come inside . I 'm gonna clear everyone else out of the building . Dr. Burkhoff can probably get his hands on some of the inhibitor . Hey . Come inside . We 're gonna suppress your ability . We 'll figure this out together . Okay ? - Okay . Come on . - Shawn . Mom 's dead , Shawn . What ? What ? It happened last night . It was my fault . I killed her . I 'm sorry , Shawn . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to hurt her . I didn 't mean to hurt anyone . I wanted you to hear something while you 're still you . When Kyle brought me to you I wasn 't lying . I really did wanna change . I tried . But I 'm not meant to lead a normal life . And it was stupid to think I could . Isabelle , everyone is in charge of their own destiny . You might not have liked the choices you had . Still , you made one . I was created to do a job . I fought it for a while but ... Now I know I have to do what they want . Kill me . Kill me right now . Don 't let them use me to end this movement . Isabelle ? You were told not to speak to Collier . Don 't worry . It won 't happen again . Because I 'm ready to get out of here . You 've got Collier . I did what you asked me to do . Now you can let my father go . No . Not yet . Your father will be released when everything 's arranged exactly as we want it . That is not what we agreed to . You know , I don 't really feel like arguing about it . I like having my abilities back . I 'll go get my father myself . I don 't think so , Isabelle . I think you 're forgetting . We took out a little insurance policy on you while you were in prison . You remember that kill switch that Tom told you about ? You 're feeling it right now . If you insist on disobeying us , I won 't hesitate to use it fully . I want to make a statement on behalf of everyone who lives in Promise City . We had nothing to do with the deaths at Saint Ambrose Hospital . Forcing people to take promicin goes against everything Jordan Collier stands for . If Jordan were here , he would tell you himself . But unfortunately , he is missing . He was abducted by enemies of the movement . We 're working to find him . But while we do , we 'd like to extend a gesture of goodwill to the city of Seattle . The residents of Promise City are already promicin-positive . We 're not vulnerable to what 's happening in the hospital . We 'd like to offer our services to the authorities . We will not move out into the city without an invitation . But we do stand ready to help . All the government has to do is ask . So you ready to hand over control of the city to Collier 's army ? We might need them before this is over . I 'm not sure , Meghan . I didn 't even know Collier was missing until now . Has Tom been able to tell you anything ? Let me know if he starts to remember . I 'll call you if anything changes here . Everything 's gone silent within Saint Ambrose and we just had word that authorities are considering sending in the first relief team . - How would you like to have that job ? - How are things at the hospital ? It 's quiet . Whatever happened there , I think it 's over . At least the screaming has stopped . Guys , look at this . Authorities tell us that ... - What just happened ? - I 'm not sure but we need to talk to the agents on site right now . But they told us it was contained . Everybody get away from her . Get away from her . Hurry . We need to seal this place off . Now . It 's not fair . Let 's go . I didn 't even take the shot . Okay , come on , let 's go . Let 's go . I was five feet from him . And I lived . It doesn 't seem right . What 's gonna happen to us now ? I mean , everyone who survived , are we gonna develop abilities ? Are you two okay ? Yeah . What 's going on out there ? We 're picking up the pieces . The worst is over . For us , anyway . But someone must have gotten out and infected everyone on the perimeter . Sickness is spreading through the neighborhood near Saint Ambrose . And the police and the emergency services . People must have brought the virus back from the barricade too . - They 've been devastated . - So who 's watching over the city ? Right now , no one . But the Army has Seattle surrounded . The entire district is under quarantine . How far is this thing gonna spread ? We don 't know . But right now , I wanna keep focused on this building . Marco , we gave everyone promicin tests . - Did the results come in yet ? - Yeah . They 're preliminary , but it looks like everyone who survived is positive . Except for one person . You . Me ? Why ? It 's just a guess . You know , last year Dr. Burkhoff forced an early version of promicin on you . You didn 't get an ability but it does look like your body developed a resistance to promicin exposure . There 's no chance that I could infect anybody ? No . I mean , I don 't think so . How do you feel ? Tired . What did you give me ? I included a sedative in the sample of the inhibitor I mixed up . We won 't know if your ability is suppressed for a few hours . I don 't wanna sleep . I wanna help . There 's nothing you can do right now . Just close your eyes , bro . Have you given any thought to what you wanna do ? I 'm gonna give Danny to NTAC . - I think I have to . - I think so too . They have to study your brother . He may be the only way to find an antidote . Once the government has him , who knows if they 'll ever let him go . I don 't wanna lose my brother and my mom on the same day . Jeez . My mom is gone . The police have fired another round of tear gas . The virus got into city hall . The mayor 's down . Half the city council . Police , paramedics . People are abandoning their posts in droves . I think we need to take Kyle Baldwin up on his offer . See if his positives can 't restore some order . Are you ready to cross that line ? We don 't have a choice . The federal government is focused on containment . They 're basically writing Seattle off . We can 't let that happen . I 'm going to Promise City . Well , you can 't just drive across town . Let me go . I 'm the one who 's supposed to be resistant to this . That 's why you 're going to the 4400 Center . You could be the key to this . If someone could figure out why you 're not vulnerable , maybe they could replicate the effect and create a vaccine . Okay , well we 're not doing it , because NTAC Medical is shut down . Shawn Farrell is not developing that compatibility test on his own . Someone is doing the research . Someone with a scientific background . Someone like Kevin Burkhoff ? My sister 's dead . That was Shawn . Susan was in that hospital . She 's dead . Oh , my God . Tom , I 'm so sorry . You should lie down . I can 't imagine what you 're feeling now . No . No , I 'll mourn later . Where 'd you put my gun ? I remember it all now . Everything . The Marked have Collier . I know where they 're keeping him . Tell us where he is . I 'll put together a task force . It has to be me . Isabelle 's there . She has her abilities back . They think I 'm one of them . I 'll walk in , I 'll get Collier , find out what they 're planning . Let me do this , please . I have to . I 've been authorized to accept your offer of assistance . What did you have in mind ? We need to restore order to the streets . I would like to use your people as a temporary security force . The first thing we need to do is write a list of all the abilities at your disposal . Then we can figure out how to deploy them . There 's no reason to make a plan . Jordan already has one in place . I know exactly what we have at our disposal . And I know where to send them to take control of the city . I am glad you 're so prepared to take over Seattle . But when this is over , I want my city back . The whole world is terrified of what 's happening here . That 's an opportunity . Once this is over , we use all our influence , here and abroad , and push for all-out war against the positives . This time , we will be heard . Yes . Great . Funny how things happen . You 've got Collier but you 're losing Seattle . You 're wrong . I 'm not going to stand by and watch a militia of positives take command of this city . We thought the movement would fall apart once we had Collier . But that didn 't happen . Someone stepped in and took his place . - You 're talking about Kyle . - That 's right . He has to be stopped . You have to stop him . You 're going back into Promise City and you 're going to kill Kyle Baldwin . Kyle 's your only real connection to your past , this idea of yourself that you 've been hanging on to . Once he 's gone , you 'll let it go . You want him dead . I 'm your weapon . I get it . Isabelle . You 've been out of contact for a long time . Where have you been ? I was doing damage control . Skouris has been telling people I 'm marked . Do they believe her ? My boss doesn 't . Meghan Doyle cares about Tom Baldwin . I brought her around . Anyway , their hands are full . The virus got into NTAC . It killed Baldwin 's sister too . I had to shed a few tears just for appearance 's sake . This city has gotten out of control . Half of NTAC is developing new abilities . How are we responding ? Collier 's been marked . We 're waiting for him to turn . In the meantime , I sent Isabelle to Promise City to deal with the new leader of the movement . Kyle Baldwin . Good . Your body produces abnormal amounts of an enzyme called ubiquinone . It 's a compound that boosts the immune system . An overproduction of it made you resistant to promicin . If we replicate that effect , can we make a vaccine ? People are dying right now . We don 't have time to mass-produce some enzyme and get it to people . We don 't have to mass-produce anything . Ubiquinone is already available as a supplement . They sell it in pills in health food stores . Pharmacies . Okay , if you take enough of them , can you develop a resistance quickly ? Shawn , I just checked in on your brother . He doesn 't look good . We have to get word out about these pills . You go . I 'll start making phone calls . The inhibitor is working . You 're no longer contagious . But your body is still producing promicin . And since it can no longer disperse it into the air via your ability , it 's building up in your system . I 'm choking on the stuff . It 's all right , Danny . We 're gonna figure it out . So , what can we do to help him ? We could take him off the inhibitor . Physically he 'd be fine . But I 'd be contagious again . - Exactly . - No way . - That 's not an option . - Danny ... No , Shawn . What happens if I stay on the inhibitor ? You 're saying I 'll die ? I 'm getting you out of here . That thing inside you ? There 's a way to get rid of it . How ? You can worry about that once you 're out of here . No matter what happens to me , don 't stop until you 're through the door . My car 's right outside . If anything happens to me , you need to call Kyle right away . Parrish sent Isabelle after him . If you 're an NTAC agent again , what happens once we 're out of here ? Am I gonna arrest you ? I 'd love to . But that 's not the plan . As much as it hurts me to admit it , this city needs you right now . Are you ready ? Yeah . You flinched when I told you Isabelle was going after your son . No one 's ever managed to get rid of a mark before . You 're gonna have to tell me how you did it . Later . All our teams are in place . We have Ravenna under control . - Beacon Hill 's quiet . - Good . Let 's move your people into north gate . See if we can stop the looting . We can 't start distributing these ubiquinone supplements until the city is calm . Hi , Kyle . Close your eyes . No . If you 're gonna do what I think you are , you have to look me in the eye . You couldn 't kill me . You 're human . There 's so much of the world that I never saw . So much that 's beautiful . You have time . You can see whatever you want . We can . You have a good heart , Kyle . Goodbye . These pills are the way that we can stop anyone else from dying . I 'm proud to say that the 4400 Center is working in conjunction with the government and residents of Promise City to distribute this over-the-counter product to every neighborhood in Seattle . If you haven 't already been infected , these will either save your life , or they will keep you from getting an ability . The government is also working with relief agencies to airlift supplies of ubiquinone into the city . So there 'll be enough for everyone . People are wondering what Seattle is gonna look like when this is all over . How many people will have lost their lives . How a city with so many unwanted new abilities is going to function . The truth is , we don 't have any answers . But this city has survived a lot . And it will survive this . Thank you all for coming . You risked a lot to get this message out . And do not forget to take your pills . Shawn . Thank you . None of this is gonna mean anything unless that air lift happens . Oh , we 're working on it . I 'm coordinating distribution between the CDC , FEMA , and the Red Cross . Look , I know that you 're dealing with a lot , but you helped keep this contained , and you were the right face to put in front of the public . Shawn ? Shawn . Yeah , buddy . I 'm right here . It really hurts . It hurts to breathe . I 'm gonna fix that . - Make you feel better for a little bit . - No . Don 't . You did that an hour ago . Look at me . Danny , we 're gonna take you off the inhibitor - and we 're gonna put you in isolation . - No , it 's too dangerous . Not anymore . We know about those pills now . What if they don 't work around me ? Or what if in a week from now my ability gets stronger ? The whole thing could start again . Too many people are dead because of me , Shawn . It 's not your fault . I know but I have to live with it . I 'm not gonna make it through this , Shawn . I know it . You 're not gonna die , Danny . - I 'm not gonna let you . - It 's okay . But I need you to do something for me . Just make it stop hurting . Just make the pain go away for good . Okay ? Oh , Danny , no . I 'm not gonna do that . I 'm not gonna do that . You 're my little brother . Then I 'm begging you , brother . - Don 't . - Please , Shawn . Let me be the last victim . Please do it . Please . Please , Shawn . I beg you . Please , Shawn . Do it now . I love you . Please . I can 't breathe . I can 't . You made your choice . You are our only hope for the future . Your future 's dead now . You 're free now . Make this world better than it is . You understand what you have to do to get rid of that thing inside you ? You 'll have to mend fences with Shawn . Well , I 'm more than willing . I hope he will be too . Jordan , there 's one more thing . There 's seven names there , the rest of the Marked . They 're gonna need the same treatment you get . These are powerful people . That 's why NTAC can 't handle it . We 'd never be able to get them through official channels . I can 't help but wonder , when we walk back into the city , who 's gonna be in charge . My side or yours . I think soon that distinction won 't mean a thing . Be well , Tom . We are gathered here today to pay our respects to Susan and Danny Farrell , a wonderful mother and a loving son . They will be missed , as will so many others . The entire city is grief-stricken today . We 're all asking ourselves the same question : How are we going to deal with all this loss , all this pain ? But I believe within that question lies our answer , our salvation . Because it is a shared loss , it is a shared pain , and only together through sympathy , through understanding and through love can we rise above this tragedy . Shawn , I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry , man . Thank you . - Hey . - Hey . Jordan told me everything that happened . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'll get there . I know you cared about Isabelle . And I 'm sorry she 's gone . I know how you 're feeling right now , Shawn . You 're thinking that everyone 's gone , that you 're alone . But you 're not . I 'm here . So is Kyle . And we 're gonna help each other get through this . We 're gonna figure out how to be a family , okay ? I just got a revised estimate of the tally so far . We know the city has lost 9,000 people . That 's just confirmed dead . It 's not a final count . So we 're looking at 9,000 new abilities at the very least . A lot of those abilities are gonna belong to people we know . NTAC , police , paramedics ? I mean , we were the first ones exposed to this thing . What are we gonna do ? Arrest ourselves ? No one 's arresting anybody right now . Every city agency is operating on a skeleton crew . We won 't have federal help until they lift the quarantine . That 'll be a week , maybe more . So we 're still on our own . The loudest voice of authority in Seattle right now is Jordan Collier 's . Well , his p-positives are the most effective law and order we 've got . And when quarantine 's lifted , what happens ? Are Collier 's people gonna stand down ? Will they give the city back to us ? Would you ? The time has come for this city to begin healing . I never intended promicin to spread this way . But the sacrifices of the past few days have not been in vain . This tragedy , terrible as it may have been , had meaning . And those who died are the heralds of a new age . Thousands upon thousands of you have new abilities and in time you will all contribute to this movement . A movement that now claims all Seattle as its home . Who are you ? I 'm Jed Garrity . Who the hell are you ? We have stood by this city in its hour of need . And we will now guide this city into the future . We 're all miracles , every one of us . And together we will do wondrous things . See ? I told you he was a good guy . I understand how ... Maia , can 't you see what 's happening ? Jordan Collier is naming himself dictator of Seattle . There 's nothing good about that . You 're wrong , Mom . We are in charge now . It 's better that way . I 've spoken to the world before of heaven on Earth . Many of you thought of it impossible . But now I am convinced we will see it in our lifetime . There 's a way to live with it . To kill people , even though it wasn 't really you , you still feel responsible . Believe me , I have been there . Two people are dead . They 're not Collier . They 're not coming back . But you 're still here . You have to figure out how to move on . How ? Dad , it 's time .

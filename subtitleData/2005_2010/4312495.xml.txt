 The sun rises on a new dawn . Yet few of us realise the debt we owe to those responsible for this . To those who dwell among us anonymous , seemingly ordinary , whom destiny brought together to repair , to heal , to save us from ourselves . If evolution can do this for even the smallest of creatures then why not these human beings ? If someone here found out about me , what would happen ? - When will they stop ? - I don 't know . She 's a shiny new toy and she 's all mine . And they 're still out there , among us in the shadows , in the light . We pass them on the street without a glance , never suspecting , never knowing . Do they even know yet ? Are they bound together for a common purpose ? A glaring reality ... To be extraordinary . Teleportation , tissue regeneration . These are no longer simply theories . I have seen them with my own eyes . And when destiny does anoint them ... My name is Hiro Nakamura . I 'm from the future . - ... how do they hide from it ? - You may feel confined here , but this is far freer a cage than the one they put you in . How long can they dwell in the shadows before either fate or theirown flawed humanity draws them out into the light , again . And how will they know what awaits them when it finally does ? Not only are these special individuals among us ... they bear a curse . A virus which strips them of their powers and leads to their eventual death . In the last months , I have discovered what I believe to be a plague . A plague which targets only these unique individuals . It 's a disease which threatens to eradicate them all . And in doing so , deprives our species of its evolutionary advancement . Without this advancement , the challenges of the modern world , global warming , terrorism , diminishing resources , seem almost insurmountable on our thin shoulders . The face of humanity itself hangs in the balance . With proper funding and research , we can stop the advancement of this disease . I urge each and every one of you to take up this cause , spread the word , and fight those who 'd keep the world from the truth . Thank you all for coming . Inspirational lecture , Dr Suresh . I was wondering if I could trouble you for an autograph . Your father would 've been so proud . So would your sister . - Who are you ? Why are you following me ? - This isn 't necessary . Think I didn 't recognise you ? You 've been at my lectures . - Yeah . - Company sent you to bag and tag me ? A year ago , I would 've run , but not anymore ! That 's good , because if you had , I wouldn 't be able to offer you a job . I 've been down that road before . - It doesn 't end well . - Where will you go , Dr Suresh ? No one even believes they exist . I found your father 's book in the parapsychology section in-between hypnosis and alien abductions . They don 't take you seriously . They all think you 're nuts . But not me . So if you 're really interested in saving the world , the least you can do is let me buy you a drink . Ugh ! All the electives I wanted filled up last semester . Come on . It 's your first day . You should be excited . I am . It 's easy for you to say . You 're not wading into the shark-infested waters of 11th grade . I don 't have one friend . I am shark bait . Oh , you 're gonna do fine . They don 't look any different than the kids in Texas . OK , except for her . So maybe they 're a little more ... sophisticated . - You 're gonna fit right in . - If you say so . - Just remember what we talked about . - I know . I 'm Claire Butler . - I won 't slip up . - It 's not just the name . It 's everything . Trust me . The company is still out there . They will find us unless we 're flawless with our plan . From now on ... you have to be entirely un-extraordinary . Right . Don 't stand out in any way . Exactly . Don 't raise your hand in class . And don 't even think about trying out for cheerleading . Oh , come on , Dad . That 's all behind me . - Just blend in . Be ordinary , right ? - You got it . You know , we might want to start by you not driving me to school . - It kind of draws attention to me . - Ouch . And , you know don 't you think it might be easier on all of us if I had my own car ? Your mother and I were going to surprise you on your birthday next month . But ... Oh , my gosh . The Rogue ? - Thank you , Daddy ! - Oh ! It 's yours . The best dad in the world . I know . I know . Claire . It 's just ... I can 't help thinking about how many times I 've said goodbye to you on the first day of school . I 'm so sorry for everything I 've put you through . I hope you know how much I love you . Sorry . Whoa ! I 'm asking one more time . Come out with your hands up . Look , I know this sucks , NYPD showing up at your door like this . I get it . But this is what happens when you take somebody hostage . I just need to make sure everybody gets out of there safely , OK ? Aah ! Both of you , hands up . - I 'm the hostage ! Shoot her . - I 'm the hostage ! - Shoot her . - I 'm the hostage . - I 'm the hostage ! Shoot her ! - I 'm the hostage ! No , shoot him ! - Shoot him . - Shoot her . Shoot her ! Shoot her ! Dude , it 's her . Shoot her . - Shoot her . - Aah ! How did you know ? OK , guys . Good job . Let 's clean this place up . All guns to the armoury . How did you know which one to shoot ? I don 't know . Tone of voice , eye contact . Hostage looked me in the eye . The other was looking for an exit . Most people notice a gun under the bad guy 's shirt . Right . Yeah , that too . Of course . You know , guys who get shot like you did , they just take that worker 's comp and call it a day . I 've been , uh , I 've wanted to be a cop my whole life . Four bullets to the chest aren 't gonna change that . Well , we were gonna drag this out , make you sweat . But I figured , what 's the point ? Take that off . I figured that , uh , you 'd rather have a real one . - Well , you gonna take it ? - Yeah . Yeah . Thank you . Wow , thank you so much . Turn on your Bunsen burners , people , and be careful . You got a death wish ? Uh , you talking about that ? I was just seeing how hot it was . Pretty sure it 's hot . It 's called a flame . Yeah . I was just kidding around . Like you were this morning when you stepped in front of my car ? That 's OK . Made my morning interesting . - I 'm West . - Claire . - You 're new , right ? - Yeah . So what are you ? - Meaning what , exactly ? - Meaning ... are you one of them ? Or one of the others ? I 'm not sure I know what you 're getting at . Well , let me break it down for you . Are you a robot or an alien ? 'Cause everyone in the world is one or the other . Robots do what they 're told . Stick with the herd . Aliens , on the other hand , do their own thing . Well , uh , I don 't know . - Do I have to choose ? - Most people do . - So what are you ? - OK , everyone . In the struggle for survival , it is the fittest who win out at the expense of their rivals . Now , who said this ? Come on , people . Journey of the Beagle . Evolution ! Anyone ? Charles Darwin . It was Charles Darwin . Easy one . You are late . - No , I believe I 'm right on time . - I believe that your watch is slow . - Guess what ? - What ? Max Grossman tried to kiss me today . - What ? - Mr Parkman ? - Yeah . - Can I speak to you for a minute ? Uh , sure . Can you give us a second ? Sure . Is everything OK ? Yeah , I 'm just a little concerned , that 's all . Molly 's been falling asleep in class the last week or so . When I asked her about it , she said she 's been having some nightmares . Um , she 's got kind of a big imagination . I realise there 's nothing I can do about them , so I 'm trying to make her - feel as safe as possible . - About that . It 's not my place ... Your situation isn 't the most stable . - My situation ? - Your injuries , your divorce . Look . My divorce is my business , and ... All you need to know is that Molly is loved and well cared for , - and she 's doing great . - She 's struggling , Mr Parkman . Why ? Why ? Because she 's having a few nightmares ? Because of these . She started drawing them a week or so ago . Every day , they get a little worse . - Oh , my God . - And I have to ask you , what is this ? It 's in every single picture . Excuse me . What are you doing here , Ma ? It 's time to move on , Nathan . He 's dead . You don 't know that . Leave his stuff alone . He 's gonna want it when he gets back . You 're drunk . Thank God your father isn 't here to see you . Or you , for that matter . You killed your brother . Drove Heidi away . Drove your kids away . If you 'd followed our plan , done what you were supposed to do , he 'd be alive now . To think I almost listened to you . You 're evil , Ma . Get out . Huh ? Excuse me . You are late . My daughter 's first day of high school . Had to make sure she was OK . That 's somehow my problem ? Shipment of toner cartridges came in last night . I know , I was here . When , exactly , were they going to get installed ? 'Cause I don 't see anybody else here doing it . - I 'm gonna do it this morning . - Uh-huh . And if I wasn 't here ... watching your every move ? You 've been here a few months . Think it 's time I saw some commitment of excellence from you . When I was assistant manager , we were set before the first customer walked through that door . That is how I got this . Paper business is dog eat dog . You gotta live it and breathe it . You gotta want it . Do you want it , Butler ? Do you ? Yes , sir . Yeah ... Well ... we 'll see . The company was formed 30 years ago with a group of like-minded individuals . Ordinary men and women who were gifted with extraordinary powers . They wanted to help their own . To find them and to protect them . We find people , and we make sure they don 't become dangerous . Now , sometimes , that can mean making sure they understand entirely what they 're capable of , and teaching them to use their abilities for the good of mankind . And , sometimes , it can mean eliminating them . Who the hell are you to judge who lives and who dies ? If I 'm not mistaken , you yourself tried to put a bullet in the brain - of a man named Sylar . - He was a monster . Yes . And you were willing to kill him for the greater good . You acted on a moral imperative to protect your species . It doesn 't matter one way or the other about Sylar . - He 's no longer a threat . He 's dead . - And now you have Molly . You and Matt Parkman are protecting her . We 're not interfering with that arrangement . Far from it . We 're offering to help you . We have resources to offer you , Dr Suresh . The plague . You talked about the disease which killed your sister , Shanti . - The virus . - Yes . We have the funds you need for your research . Now , can you imagine what would happen if that virus mutated and crossed over into the general population ? Look , the type of research you 're talking about is extremely expensive . Trust me . That won 't be a problem . Let 's just say we have our own private Fort Knox . So ... can we count you in ? - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Dinner ! Uh , shouldn 't I be eating some vegetables every once in a while ? That is why I got you a vegetable pizza , smarty-pants . Plus I got your favourite for dessert . Trying to bribe me 'cause you never cook . - I miss Mohinder . He cooks . - Hey , I can cook . I just thought , why not order pizza ? Give us time to talk . Hmm . Talk about what ? This ? That mean you passed your detective 's exam ? - With flying colours . You proud of me ? - Hmm , depends . Did you cheat ? Why would you ask me that ? Pulling the answers out of people 's minds ... it 's unfair . My talent . Wouldn 't think a baseball player 's cheating ' cause he 's athletic . - It 's not the same and you know it . - No . I wanna talk to you about these drawings that you made at school . - You 're changing the subject . - Miss Gerber 's concerned and so am I. You don 't want to talk about your exams , I don 't want to talk about my dreams . Molly , I want to help you . I don 't want you to be afraid ... I said I didn 't want to talk about it ! Can I finish my dinner in my room ? Sure . Go ahead . No ! Victory ! Victory ! That 's our cry ! Claire ! Nice move , ballerina . How 's that floor taste ? Are you OK ? Don 't listen to them . I 'm going to go find the birdie thing . - Thank you . - No problem . - Robot . - So I 'm a robot now ? - Far as I can tell . - Oh . OK . Birdie , please . - You don 't even know me . - You had the answer today , in class , but you didn 't say it . Don 't want people to know you 're smart . You just have me all figured out , huh ? - Know a robot when I see one . - Hmm . Come on , Martha . It 's just a backflip off the tower . And you know the girls will catch you . - Just leave her alone , OK ? - OK , one , don 't know you . And two , as captain of the cheerleading squad , it 's totally within my rights to recruit talent where I see it . I think Martha here has what it takes to be a cheerleader . So you can do a back tuck off the tower ? - What 's the big deal ? - If it 's so easy , why don 't you try it ? In fact , if you can do a back tuck off the tower , Martha here is off the hook . All right . I 'll do it . This should be good . We 're waiting . You 're right . Can 't do it . There 's a shocker . Help me ! Help me . Help me ! Help me ! Don 't hurt me . No ! No ! No ... I can see you . - Ah ! - It 's OK . It 's OK . It 's all right . It was just a dream . - Just a dream . - Oh , my gosh , he can see me . Did you see him ? Huh ? See what he look like ? OK , you tell me where he is , I will take care of him . No . It 's too dangerous . If I tell you where he is , he 'll kill you too . No . No , no , no . Nobody 's going to kill anyone . I promise . I promise . I 'm right here . Don 't go , please . Ah ! Ah ! Why are you still here ? - You still on your break ? - Yes , I am . Supposed to be back on the floor five minutes ago . There 's a line of customers . Just finishing my coffee . Uh , no , you 're finished . Get out there . Just a few more sips , that 's all . You look at me when I talk to you . - Do you hear me ? Ah ! - I hear you , all right . Now you hear me . I am done eating your crap . From now on I will work how and when I feel like it . I 'll take breaks when I want to , and you will not say a damn word to me ever again . - Do you understand ? - Yeah . - Ow ! - We 're square on that ? Yeah ... Yeah . You are English ? Oh , and there 's a surprise . You know , there 's very few locals here with whom I can speak plain . Thank God for you , young man . Eh , sorry . Sorry . So I came over on one of the few trade vessels your emperor let pass . The boat left full of tea , I kept on to find my fortune . You should see what I got paid to fend off those bandits . Kensei Takezo does not fight for money . He fights for honour . Really ? Well , as long as it 's honour I can spend . It 's not a bad lot . I mean , I find a stout brute , put him on a horse , put him in a field , and tell him to shout on about how he 's fearsome old Kensei . Repair to the branch of a tree and start to pick off the blackguards one by one . - That 's fighting dirty ! - That 's fighting smart , sir . What ? I give him a fair wage . If he lives . No . This can 't be . No . I come from the future . Many years from now . Your noble deeds become part of our history . - The future ? - Yes . - That 's a good one . - No , it is true . I know what happens to you . As a boy , I read the book The Trials of Takezo Kensei . How you killed the black bear of Sakashita , your love of the swordsmith 's daughter , and you defeat the terrible white-bearded warlord and save the village of Otsu . - Otsu ? - You smell smoke ? Let me see it . I do not take death threats idly . - Someone 's playing a trick . - Are they ? Charles Deveaux . Linderman . Your husband . All of them . Dead . Now ... there are nine . So you think one of us sent these ? Yes . For the pain we cause . The people we have killed . There is no end to our suffering . I sought redemption by helping Hiro fulfil his destiny to save the world . How did you help your son ? Angela . I am leaving for Japan tonight . I suggest you disappear as well . - Oh , no . I broke history . - Villages burn . Those things happen . But not like this ! The future may not exist as I know it . No future . No cars . No Ando . No me . - Ah . - Great Scott . You mustn 't fret everything , my very strange little friend . Here , have some sake . It 'll brighten your day . No , forget sake ! You 're supposed to be a hero . Being a hero never filled anyone 's sack with salt and saffron . It 's a waste of time , huh ? In the stories , you are rewarded with more gold than the emperor . And you took the swordsmith 's daughter , the most beautiful woman in all Japan , for your princess . Oh ! Ow . - She 's the swordsmith 's daughter ? - Mm-hmm . And I don 't think she wants to be my princess . Wait ! Don 't leave ! - No ? - No ! You have to rescue the swordsmith and make the daughter - fall in love with you . - Ah . You have to become the legendary Japanese hero that you are destined to be . You have to fight the black bear . You have to fight the ... Oh ! The only thing I have to do is find me a drink . Come on . Eighty-six straight days of sunshine . You just can 't beat that . - Right , Lyle . - I don 't know ... I guess . So , Claire , Lyle was saying his first day of school was uneventful , how about you ? Anything special happen ? No . No , nothing ... I , uh skated by unnoticed . It was like I wasn 't even there . That 's good , honey . And how about you , sweetheart ? Me ? Anything interesting happen today at Copy Kingdom ? I made a calendar for some grandparents , and a co-worker brought in doughnuts . That 's great . I just think it 's amazing how well we have all adjusted to our new lives here . It 's inspirational , really . The Bennets were given lemons , and what did we make ? - Uh , lemonade ? - Exactly . - I 'll second that . - We 're all flourishing , really . All except Mr Muggles . No one has any idea you 've won two regional championships , five all-breed rallies , Poor little guy . I mean , how do you go back to the farm after you 've seen gay Paree . Thank you . Oh ! Must be work . Excuse me . Excuse me . - Well ? - They finally took the bait . They caught up with me in Cairo . - I 'm in . - Good . It 's all falling into place . Just ... Just stay careful . Watch your back . And you and I will bring this whole company down . No . - Why are you calling me ? - I don 't know . I 'm not sure . Well , don 't do it again . I gotta go . No . Wait . Listen , I know why you 're doing this . I get it . I miss him too . I just ... I need someone to talk to . - I don 't know if I can do this anymore . - Do what ? Not be who I really am . And I know that I can 't be who they want me to be . And I just feel like I 'm gonna burst . Look , I know you 're looking for answers . We all are . But trust me , I am not the guy ... to give ' em to you . I 'm sorry . Of all of them , I never expected it would be you . Hey ! Kaito ! Ah ! What are you trying to do , kill the poor bastard ? Sorry . Drag him someplace he 'll stay dry . Make sure he 's breathing . - Right you are , boss . - We 're looking for 9-1-0-9 . The numbers are on the side here . Supposed to be third row back . Hey , boss . Over there . Hey , I figured I 'd keep a case for meself . What are you gonna do with a dozen iPods ? - You can barely use a computer . - Oh , what do you know ? What the hell ? Maybe we got the wrong number . No , the number 's right . Something else is wrong . What 's that ? What the hell are you doing here ? Where are the iPods ? You heard your man . How 'd youse get in here ? Maybe this will jog your memory . - What the hell was that ? - Who the hell are you ? I said , who are you ? What 's your name ? I don 't know . I don 't know .

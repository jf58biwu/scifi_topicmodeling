Previously on the 4400 ... you disappeared . Do you have any idea where you 've been ? Everhere . You won 't feel anything . I saw the catastrophe , and i know what we have to do to stop it . My life ... my future ... it 's tied up with the 4400 . [ Alana ] : kyle 's lving . Kyle , what are you dng ? I got a job . I 'm going to travel around the country for a little while . You 're going to get married . Did you haen to see who the lucky guy was ? Maia , this is my friend , ben . I heard a lot about you , young lady . You saw me getting married to my sister 's boyfriend ? Mm-hmm . Are all these people 4400s ? Some are , and some just wish thewere . Good morning . Welcome to the center . Are you a 4400 ? No , sweetie . Are you here to take our seminar ? No , we 're here to look at the school . Are you sure you want to do this ? I want to meet kids like me . Thomas ... what are you doing ? It 's 2 : 00 in the morning . Yeah , i couldn 't sleep . Kyle left this stuff behind . He wanted me to throw it out . I figured i 'd ... look through it , see if he might want to kp any of it . You know , for when he comes home . Sorry i woke you up . Are you sure you want tdo this ? Shawn ... devon asked for this . She 's ready . Ever since i first showed up at the center , this is what i 've wanted . This is why i came . Besides , if anything goes wrong , you 're here , rig ? Um , i 'm ... i 'm bringing you a message about a better future . It 's here . Now . This serum contains promicin . Everyone knows what that is . It 's the neurotransmitter that gives the 4400 their abilities . It 's here , now , within our grasp ... this video went up the internet six hours ago . We have tried to suppress it , but it keeps showing up on new servers . With these shots , i 'm going to train my body to produce promicin . Doesn 't that woman work for your nephew ? I am going to develop a 4400 ability ... and so can you . An enormous government stockpile of promicin goes missing , and a day later , an employee of the 4400 center shows up on the internet collier doesn 't care if we come for him . Does he really think people are goi to inject this into their bodies , though ? They 're definitely curious . This video 's been downloaded almost 100,000 times already . By the end of the day , it 'll be 10 times that . Collier might look like some kind of prophet now , but the businessman inside him iqn 't totally dead . The man still knows how to create a market for his product . These shots are going to be available everywre ... soon . you 've been all through this place , and i understand you 've searched my other real estate holdings as well . Yeah , the ones we know about . You haven 't found any pricing , nor will you . Your employees don 't seem to have any trouble finding the stuff . There 's one on the internet right now , talking about the start of a new era . It 's a bold idea . I wish i 'd thought of it . Devon 's a courageous girl . She 's always aspired to something higher . I 'm not surprised she made it happen . I 'd congratulate her ... if i knew where she was . This isn 't just a plan . It 's a revolutio you realize that , don 't you ? Handing out promicin like candy changes everything , shawn . Nobody will be able to enforce the law . It 'll be chaos . Nobody can predict what 's going to happen once people everywhere start developing abilities . You need to tell us where he 's keeping this stuff . I don 't get you guys . All along , you 've been saying we 're on the same side , no matter what our differences are , that our goals are the same ... for things to change , get better ... now a man is back from the dead to show us how to get there , and you two want to stop him . You know what ? You can 't . Our phone lines have been jammed up all morning . People are dying to know how they can get their hands on the shot . So , what do you tell them ? I tell them that we have nothing to do with it , and then i wish them good luck . If he 's the voice of moderation , we 're in a lot of trouble . Tom , i need a minute . There 's something i got to do . And don 't forget about the decimal point . You just bring that above the division ... ms . Skouris . Can i help you ? Yeah , i need my daughter . What ? We 're going . ... the 4400 their abilities . With these sts , i 'm going to train my body to produce promicin . I am going to develop ... denn ? We need to move against collier now . These shots are going to be available ... how are we supposed to stop the 4400 if we just sit back and let everyone have a chance to become one ? If collier puts this promicin out on the street ... he 'll be doing our work for us . I 'm not leaving school . You can 't make me . I like it there . I told you , the center 's involved in some bad stuff , and you 're not safe there . I 'm not safe anywhere . At least i was happy there ... but you don 't really care about that , do you ? Sweetie , i do care , and we 'll work something out . We 'll go back to home-schooling for a while ... home-schooling sucks . Excuse me ? We 're not finished here , young lady . Ben . I thought you were in london . Yeah , i didn 't go . This whole " time to think " thing isn 't working for me . I ... needed to see you . I 'm kind of in the middle of something her - Guess that can wait . Come on in . Is april still here ? No , she left . Stormed out , i guess you could say . But she only took half her stuff . Called her a few times , no luck . Ha . I wouldn 't call me back either . Look , i 'm sorry that things are bad with you guys . Honestly , i haven 't had much time to think about it . Maia 's not talking to me . Everything 's blowing up at work . I have no idea how all this is going to end . How about it ends happy ? I have a job offer in spain . It 's long . Six months , maybe more . I 'm thinking of taking it . You 're leaving . Only if you come with me . You and maia . Think about it . You 've given everything you 've had to this job for years . It 's time to let someone else pick up the cause . It 'll be better for you . It 'lbe better for maia . I have thought about leaving . Just going qomeplace safe . It just never seemed possie . But it is . You have an option of walking away . It 's important you remember that . I 've been working on the video of devon moore that 's making the rounds on the internet . I isolated the audio , played up the background noise ... that noise you 're hearing , it 's a garbage truck , moving in reverse , so wherever the tape was made , there was the garbage truck doing its rounds outside . Okay , well , that narrows it dow i mean , a little . But there must be doze of neighborhoods scheduled for garbage collection last night . That is true , but ... [ ship 's whistle blowing ] That sounds like a boat whistle . A ferry whistle , to be exact . So they 're near the water . They 're somewhere between edmonds and woodway . I checked it out . Those are the only blocks near the waterfront with garbage pickups scheduled for last night . I feel kind of weird . Iq that normal ? Kevin went through the same thing . You 're lucky , actually . The promicin from ryland 's company is pure . It 'll be easier for you . I wonder what ability i 'll get . I 'm sure it 'll be great . Close your eyes , okay ? Rest . How is she ? She 's fine . I think . She 's tired . It 's hard to believe it 's all starting , isn 't it ? Everything we 've worked for . It 's not hard for me . I 've believed in you all along . There was a reason we were taken . A reason they woke you up . It 's incredible . You should be getting the nobel prize . Instead , we 're hiding like criminals . It won 't be like this forever . Soon we 'll be heroes . Oh , my god ! Call shawn ! Wait ... it 's all right . It 's all right ! Tess , hurry ! This looks promising . It 's 3516 bay street , two blocks west of woodway . Municipal records indicate it 's unoccupied , but some offshore company pays the property tax . Sounds like one of collier 's safe houses . Look at this . The utilities have just been turned on . Let 's go ring the bell , see who answers . Kevin ! It 's okay . There 's some men coming up to the house . They have guns . We have to go . Shh ... shh ... shawn , we have to go . No . Shawn , ntac is right outside ! We have to leave ! Now ! No ! I am not leaving her ! It 's okay . It 's okay . Devon , look at me , okay ? Just keep looking at me . Go ! [ Shawn ] : Devon ! Devon ! Shawn ! Shawn ... step away , shawn . Keep your hands where everyone can see them , okay ? I couldn 't save her . It 's okay . She 's dead . It 's okay . Come here . Come here . How could this happen ? How could devon die ? It makes no sense . Ryland 's giving that stuff to soldiers and then parading them around on national tv . Well , her body uldn 't handle it . She died of a massive aneurysm . Shawn ... you 're in a lot of trouble here , and the people i work with , they believe you 're involved in a conspiracy to distribute promicin , so you need to talk to us . What were you doing at that safe house ? Who called you ? I 'm sorry about what happened to devon , i am , but ... i 've got nothing to say . Devon wasn 't the first sacrifice the future has asked of us . She won 't be the last . We will honor her memory . We aan do that later . Ntac has shawn . It 's only a matter of time before they get e location of this place from him . Need to destroy this stuff . Cut and run . Why ? If they want to come , let them come . That 's why you have us here , right ? I admire your bravery . We may need it . But not yet . I tested shawn to remind him of his loyalties . He will not betray us . His loyalties aren 't the issue . We 've seen it before . If the government wants to know something , they 'll do whatever it takes to get it . He will be tested , yes , richard , but he 'll endure ... long enough for us to begin distribution . " Begin distribution " ? Why would you want to do that ? This stuff killed devon . A dosage problem . It has to be . The promicin from your daughter is different from what i 've been using . It 's too pure . Richard , look , we need people to develop abilities . If we stop now , they will paint us as murderers . If we keep going , we are murderers . Jordan , this is over . I 'm ending this . [ Tess ] : Mr. Tyler ? I don 't think you should do that . We 're alunder a lot of strain . Maybe you should just sit down for a while . Let 's get this cleaned up . We need to be ready to leave . Sweetie , do you want to watch a movie ? You can pick . April . Hey . Hey . I came by to get my stuff . I packed it up for you . Oh . Is that new ? Oh . Yeah . Little gift myself . I like it . Di ... don 't pretend , okay ? I did it to remind myself who i am . I guess i wasn 't meant for that whole ... settled thing i was going for with ben . I brought you something . Oh , you 're giving me a present ? Mom 's engagement ring . I gave that to you , april . I don 't have any use for it . Besides , i kind of owe you . I mean , don 't get me wrong , i 'm still pissed , but you saved me from being someone that i 'm not . Thank you . Just don 't invite me over for thanksging , okay ? Hey , just one thing . When maia predicted that you would end up with ben , did you really fight against it ? As hard as you told me that you did ? I thought so . But to be honest , now , i ... l-i 'm just not so sure . I 'm not at all surprised that girl died . That 's exactly why we need to get this stuff out of collier 's hands . We need to know about your promicin supply , dennis . Your people have been working with it for months . Have you ever seen anything like this ? We 've had some casualties among the volunteers . Casualties ? How many ? We recruited 20 men for the ogram . Half of them rejected the promicin within 48 hours of their first shot . " Rejected " ? You mean " died . " We knew there 'd be risks , diana . We explained it to the volunteers before they signed on . Oh , my god . You knew . You knew what would happen when people ok this ? Why didn 't you tell us when it was stolen ? We could have warned collier , warned the public ... because gods don 't make mistakes . What better way to show the people that collier is not some sort of messiah than have him fall flat on his face in public ? You kept quiet so you could discredit collier ? A woman is dead , dennis , and you 're just as responsible as he is ! She shouldn 't have been injecting stolen promicin , and anybody who follows her lead will have to live with the consequences ... or not . So this promicin that collier 's holding , if you take it , you have a 50 % chance of dying within 48 hours ? Or a 50 % chance of eventually developing some kind of ability . We need to hire more agents . I don 't know . 50-50 . Those aren 't very good odds . For a chance to become one of the 4400 ? I think there 's a lot of people who 'd take them . How did your nephew react to the news ? He 's still not talking . He doesn 't think there 's any way collier will move ahead with the plan . Tom , we 've been working on him for almost a day . We need to step up the interrogation a couple of notches . What ? No , no , no . No way . Look , i 'm not standing by while someone tortures shawn . Actually , that 's not what i had in mind . You want me to help ntac interrogate shawn ? I don 't think so , thomas . Alana , i wouldn 't have come to you if i didn 't think it was a good idea . It 'll be just like when you helped us with collier . You use your ability on him , and then , when is over , you just ... you 'd seen everything he had . We just need you to tell us where the promicin is . I know , but when i agreed to help ntac , i told you i 'd never do anything to hurt the 4400 . You 'd be helping shawn . And if you don 't do it , ntac would consider that backing out of your deal . You 'd be a fugitive again . Look , honey ... they 're going to get the information anyway , and it 'll be a whole lot tougher on shawn . Hoabout i call d.c. Myself , confirm this so-called " order " ? You do that , nina . Find out how little authority you have . What 's he doing here ? The u.s. Military is taking over the interrogation of shawn farrell . I 'm here as a consultant . We 'll be done with shawn in minutes . Alana can get all the information we need , quickly and painlessly . You expect us to trust that woman ? No , we 'll take it from here , tom . I have confidence in my interrogator . Hi , shawn . We can do this quickly , you know . Just tell me where collier 's keeping the promicin . No . I 'm curious . The whole time we were planning our wedding , you were working with ryland . Betraying me ... betraying your father ... why ? It was a balance of power thing . I was sent to eliminate the 4400 . I really didn 't want to do that . I loved you , shawn . But i had to do something , so i thought if i joined ryland and helped his side learn how to create abilities , there 'd be a standoff . If everyone has the technology ... no one can use it . Did you really think that was going to work ? Ryland 's going to use those soldiers baby ... please ... where 's the promicin ? Baby ... get your hands off of me . Now . I wouldn 't disturb her right now , tom . What are you guys doing ? Shawn ! Let him go ! Is he alive ? His pulse is weak . We 're going to need a medical team in here , right now ! Go ! Let 's go ! Did you get everything we need ? Newfield is such a nice little town . When this is over ... kevin 's going to retire , and we 're going to go back there to live . That 's never going to happen . If people start dying from that promicin , they 're going to hunt us down . We 'll be leaving . I 'd really rather tess not have to compel your cooperation . Give me your word you 're aboard , i 'll have her let you go . I can 't do that . I 'm not a murderer , and i 'm not about to let you make me into one . Do you think i want people to die ? Do you honestly believe that 's part of my plan ? We will not rce this on anyone . We 'll make people aware of the risks . That 's all we 're doing . Giving people a choice . They 're never going to take it . How much sadness is out there , richard ? How many people trapped in dead-end lives ? These shots give them a chance at the extraordinary . There will be a demand . And that 's who you want to give these abilities to ? The unhappy ? The lost ? They say the meek shall inherit the earth . I guess i just have more faith in humanity than you . Yeah , he 's stable , that 's the good news , but he hasn 't regained consciousness . They don 't know when he will . Tom , are you there ? Yeah , yeah , i 'm here . It never ends , does it ? Yeah , i 've been thinking about that a lot lately . What do you mean ? Nothing . Nothing i can talk about right now , anyway . I 'll see you soon . Thomas , you can 't go up against isabelle . It 's suicide . I have to do it . Shhas to be stopped . Shawn was her fiance . If she 's willing to leave him like that , she 's willing to do anything . The future trusted me to stop her , and they gave me a way to do it . You 'll never get close enough . Do you think she 'll let you walk up to her and use that thing ? Look , they never would have given me this if they didn 't think i had a chance . It 's okay . I have to go . I 'm sorry i 'm late . Is it okay if i sit down ? Maia , i thought you were going to be away from school for a while . I didn 't want to fall behind . I think that 'd be a bad idea , don 't you ? Uh , sure . We 're in page 37 of your workbook . Collier ? Hello , isabelle . That stuff you 're standing in front of is mine . It came from me , and i 'm taking it back . That won 't change anything . You can 't stop what i 've begun . You know , you seem to be banking on the idea that i can 't hurt you . I just don 't think that 's true . This is no good . There 's no promicin in the substance at all . I have a message from jordan collier . It 's a new world , and there 's no place for you in it . We need to get out of here now ! What happened in there ? It was all fake . No promicin . No collier . What about my men ? They 're all dead . He thought he could kill me . He was wrong . Where are you going ? Where the hell is the promicin ? Stop ! We have to find collier ! That 's what i 'm going to do . I 'm going to draw him out , make him come to me . How do you propose to do that ? I 'm going to the center . I 'm going to bring it down , and everyone in it , if i have to . No , you won 't . You work for the united states government . You don 't walk in there and just kill people in broad daylight . Each of you will receive one bag . Inside the b , you 'll find an envelope with travel money and the name of your destination . We don 't have much time . Go . These shots are free . Give them to anyone who wants them , but be careful to explain the risks . Okay , come on . Everybody take one . That 's it . There you go . Thank you all . You 're about to impact the world in a way that will never be forgotten . Thank you . Dennis ! What the hell happened here ? Where is she ? She 's too powerful . I can 't control her . No one can . Dennis ! Just tell us where she went . It 's the center . You 've got to let me pick it up . Richard tyler 's line . I 'm sorry . He 's not here right now . Oh . Your daughter 's at the center . They think she might start killing people . So ... who wants to go first ? Any volunteers ? Okay . I 'll pick . What 's your name ? Amy . i 'm going to need you to hold still , okay ? This is going to be quick . Would you like to take her place ? No . I just want to tell you something . What you 're trying to do ... it 's not going to work . Oh , really . I guess we 'll see about that . Everybody get down ! You shouldn 't have done that . Isabelle ! What ? What , are you going to tell me to stop ? That it 's still not too late to save me ? It 's past that now . You made your choice , but you 're my daughter , and if you quit this now , i 'll stand by you . I 'm sorry , daddy , but this is the way it 's supposed to be . Daddy ? Isabelle ... isabelle ... i 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I wish you hadn 't done that . Isabelle ... don 't bother . Please ... what 's the matter with me ? [ Richard ] : Hold on ! Her abilities , they 're gone . The girl 's helpless . Go ahead . Finish it . How is she ? Isabelle 's out of surgery . She 'll be in recovery for a good while , but they expect she 'll make it . You know , for a minute there , i thought you were going to put one in her head . So did i . The shoulder wound was a good idea . It let us figure out whether or not the effects of that syringe were permanent . She had started to heal herself ... i had nine more bullets in my clip . So , were they ? Permanent ? According to dr . Anapurn , it looks that way . There 's not a trace of promicin in her system . She 's just a normal girl . A normal girl who 's in a lot of trouble . You both okay ? Good ... because you 're going to have to rest up on the fly . Collier 's still in the wind . So 's his stash of promicin . The world 's about to change , and our jobs just got a whole lot more difficult . More difficult ? You up for it ? To be honest ... i don 't think so . Make sure you send me emails and take lots of pictures . Don 't worry . I guarantee there 'll be plenty of pictures . Six months will go by fast . We 'll see each other soon . No , we won 't . We 'll be back ... but you won 't be here . Do you hate me ? No . No , it 's just ... i don 't know how i 'm going to do this job without you . I have to leave , tom . If collier 's right , if moving into this new world of his means more upheaval in the here and now , i am opting out . I 'm going to find myself a place where i can live at peace with my daughter as long as i can ... diana ... you don 't have to justify your choice to me . Do you ever think about doing the same thing ? Yeah , sure . This job ... this fight , it 's ... It 's cost me so much , but ... i 'm in it till the end . Lucky me , huh ? Bye , tom . Bye . [ Engine turns over ] [ Collier ] : The end of one journey is always the beginning of another . Change is painful and always comes with a cost . It hurts to bear those costs , but we can 't allow that to sway us . Tomorrow is a mystery , and the only thing we can do is face it with resolve . We move forward , always forward , and into what 's next . We make a choice , we act on that choice , and all that 's left is to live in hope . [ Kevin ] : Jordan ! Jordan ... i got the tv working . They 're saying there 's a woman in el paso who just checked her father out of a hoqpice . He had alzheimer 's ... until she visited him this morning . Come on . They 're talking about us . Let 's go watch it happen . Good luck . Give it to a friend if you don 't use it , but give them the warning . Now , you understand what you 're about to do , right ? There are no guarantees . There never are . No guarantees , now . How about you ? It 's 50-50 . You want the shot ?

 Torchwood . Outside the Government , beyond the Police . Tracking down alien life on Earth , arming the human race against the future . The 21st century is when everything changes and you 've got to be ready . WOMAN 'S VOICE : I 'm returning to the same spot . I do hope they 're here . I have to move carefully . Don 't want to frighten them . Now then ... FLAPPING OF WINGS , TWITTERING They are ! They 're here ! My little darlings ! EERIE LAUGHTER LAUGHTER BECOMES DEMONIC TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS FLAPPING OF WINGS FLAPPING OF WINGS CONTINUES HE EXHALES You shouldn 't be here . Neither should you . What have you got ? Funny sort of weather patterns . Didn 't you see what the time was ? I was on the phone , wasn 't I ? Well , shall I call the school ? Don 't be stupid . She 'll be all right . Ow ! Who 's picking you up , Jasmine ? Roy . CHILDREN SQUABBLE CAR ENGINE STARTS Your mum asked me to fetch you ... cos she 's a bit late . FLAPPING OF WINGS I promised your mum I 'd fetch you , so get in the car . Did you hear me ? SHE GASPS EERIE , ' LIQUID ' VOICE : Come away , oh , human child ! Oh ! Come away ... Come away ... . What exactly are we doing here ? I 've had an invitation from an old friend . Here we go . FLUTTERING OF WINGS Fairies ? Are you kidding me ? I suppose I 'm one of the fortunate few who 's been allowed to see our little friends . And it 's been no easy task . One needs to have the patience of a saint and the blind faith of a prophet . But for me the long wait has been worthwhile . This is my first picture . Not that clear , I know , but the ring of stones can be seen quite distinctly . I don 't believe this . Shh ! Well , of course , I 'm not the world 's best photographer . But this little person is just about visible . I was so lucky to have seen them , so privileged to witness such a magical moment . Because fairies are shy , you see . But I know in my heart that they 're friendly , loving creatures . Thank you . POLITE APPLAUSE Wrong . She always gets it wrong . Estelle , when did you take these ? A couple of nights ago . Where ? In Roundstone Wood . Not far from here . So good to see you again , Jack . Oh , look , there 's the wood . HE SIGHS What 's wrong ? Oh , Jack and I have always disagreed about fairies . I only see the good ones . He only ever sees the bad . They 're all bad . No . I refuse to believe that . I suppose one person 's good could be somebody else 's evil . That 's what his father used to say . Oh , Jack , if only you had seen them there in the wood . They were happy . They were dancing . The fairy lights were shining . Do you have any more photos ? Yes , at home . Right . I need to see them all . TWITTERING BEATING OF WINGS TWITTERING LAUGHTER Something wrong , mate ? Sorry . Yeah , well , look where you 're bloody going . You got a problem , pal ? TWITTERING , BEATING OF WINGS HE RETCHES CONTINUOUSLY Oh , God , help me ! Help me , please ! All right , mate . Just calm down . Hey , hold on , will you ? I said , just bloody help me ! Right , that 's it ... you crazy bastard ! No ! No , please ... Where was she ? Walking home on her own . Jas , come here . Do what your mum says . You 're not my dad . Just bloody well do what she says . You must never walk home on your own , you understand ? It 's not safe . It 's all right , Mum . No-one can hurt me . Oh , thank you , Jack . This is Moses . Hello , Moses . They 're mostly just pictures of the area . Come on , my darling , it 's quite time you went outside , isn 't it ? This is you . Sorry . No , that 's my dad . He and Estelle were quite an item once upon a time . They were inseparable . Then why did they part ? It was wartime , he was posted abroad , she volunteered to work on the land . It just happened that way . WIND CHIMES RING If you don 't mind me asking , did you know Jack 's father after the war ? No . We lost touch . Why ? Did all three of you ever meet ? You , Jack and his father ? No . Never . Jack contacted me a few years ago . I was so surprised . He 's so like his dad . Same walk , same smile . I hope he 's still alive . He 'll be in his early nineties now . You could always ask Jack about him . I have , but he doesn 't seem to want to talk about his father . Estelle , when you next see these creatures you call us immediately , understand ? Mm-hm . Night or day , it doesn 't matter , just call us . And be careful , it 's important to me . But , Jack , I 've nothing to worry about . Just be careful . Please . Estelle shouldn 't be living in town . She belongs in the countryside . How often do you get to see her ? We meet up now and again . Whenever she 's seen her fairies ? She calls them fairies . I don 't . What do you call them ? They 've never really had a proper name . Why not ? Something from the dawn of time - how could you possibly put a name to that ? Are we talking alien ? Worse . How come ? Because they 're part of us , part of our world , yet we know nothing about them . So we pretend to know what they look like . We see them as happy . We imagine they have tiny little wings and are bathed in moonlight . But they 're not ? No . Think dangerous , think something you can only half see like a glimpse , like something out of the corner of your eye with a touch of myth , a touch of the spirit world , a touch of reality , all jumbled together . Old moments and memories that are frozen in amongst it . Like debris spinning around a ringed planet - tossing , turning , whirling . Then backwards and forwards through time . If that 's them we have to find them ... before all hell breaks loose . Why won 't she play anywhere else ? She likes it down there . Other kids have friends . Where 's her friends ? Must be something wrong with her . There 's nothing wrong with her . Well , when 's the last time you saw her watching TV ? Or reading a book ? Or playing with a doll ? Or sitting down to have a chat with us ? When 's the last time you heard her laugh ? BEATING OF WINGS EERIE VOICE : Come away , oh , human child , come away . LAUGHTER , BEATING OF WINGS This is the youngest girl . And the girl 's cousin . I blame it on magic mushrooms . What you do in private is none of our business . But these photographs were fake . Conan Doyle believed in them . He was gaga at the time . And Houdini . Self-publicist . How do you know so much about it ? I wrote an essay on the Cottingley glass-plate photos when I was at school . HE SNIGGERS And when the girls were old ladies they admitted they were fakes . So where was THIS sighting then ? In a place called Roundstone Wood . I know it . Has an odd history . How d 'you mean odd ? It 's always stayed wild . In ancient times it was considered bad luck to walk in there or even to collect timber . Even the Romans stayed clear of it . I 've had no report of any sighting . You won 't . These things come in under the radar , but they play tricks with the weather , so set up a programme for unnatural weather patterns . Right . Are you saying our machines can 't pick them up ? Nothing can . What is it ? Is it-is it God ? Some-somewhere safe , that 's all I want , just put me somewhere safe . Got a right one here . They tried to kill me ! Said there were flowers in his mouth . Flowers ? They 're trying to choke me . We checked . There was nothing . They didn 't want to hurt that little girl . It 's just me . They just want to hurt me , to kill me . Who wants to hurt you ? They won 't leave me alone . I 've done wrong . What d 'you mean you 've done wrong ? If it 's God , I 'm sorry , I can 't help it ! Name ? It 's little girls ... It 's their little bodies , it 's their little smiles . They 're bright as buttons . Look , um , I 've been in trouble before ... So just help me ! JUST LOCK ME UP ! Please . I asked Estelle about your dad . She said she 'd never seen the pair of you together . Why would she ? She lost touch with him after the war . I just happened to catch up with her later . Oh . BEATING OF WINGS The stones in those photographs . You know , this whole area was forest in primeval times . Most of the development areas have been built on ley lines . Anyone could have made this circle . Why do you keep doubting me ? I spell out the dangers , you keep looking for explanations . That 's what police work 's about . This isn 't police work . All right , science . It 's not science . I know . You told me . It 's that corner-of-the-eye stuff . TWITTERING DEMONIC LAUGHTER BEATING OF WINGS Ahh ! SCREAM ENDS ABRUPTLY POLICEMAN SIGHS All right ! GIGGLING JASMINE SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY Tigers can kill . Show me the tiger . I heard you laughing , Jas . It seemed like you were talking to someone . Just talking to yourself , were you ? It 's lovely to hear you laugh . I thought I 'd seen everything until now . We had him locked up , for Christ 's sake , on his own . He was shouting the odds . Said things were following him . What kind of things ? Shadows , he said . He was going on about being choked . There were four other prisoners . They saw nothing . Where are they now ? I 've had them transferred . CCTV ? I 'm dealing with that . At first I thought he was a drunk or a nutcase , or both . Right , I want this place locked off . Name ? Mark Goodson . Worked in town . Business consultant . Cause of death ? Well , going by the pinpoint haemorrhages on the eye-lids and around the hairline , I 'd say oxygen deficiency . But it 's odd . There 's no fingertip bruising on the face , no areas of pallor . Nothing to suggest that pressure was applied ? No . Yet he suffocated alone in a locked cell ? Looks like it . Wait a minute . SHE GASPS I 've never seen anything like that before . I have . Quartzite . The searching stone . Oh , let the energies flow . Help me find them again . DEMONIC LAUGHTER , BEATING OF WINGS TWITTERING LAUGHTER , BEATING OF WINGS Oh ... ! Oh ! We know the dead man was a convicted paedophile , used to hang around schools . Why the petals in his mouth ? Just a bit of fun on their part . You call that fun ? That 's the way these creatures like to do things . They play games , they torment and they kill . Why ? As a punishment or a warning to others . They protect their own . The chosen ones . Somehow children and the spirit world , they go together . So how do we stop them ? First we have to find out who they want . And we can 't trap them . They have control of the elements - fire , water , the air that we breathe . They can drag that air right out of our bodies . Sometimes I think they 're part Mara . Mara ? Kind of malignant wraiths . It 's where the word nightmare came from . They suffocate people in their sleep . PHONE RINGS Yeah ? Jack , it 's me , Estelle . What is it ? You were right , Jack . There are bad ones . They 've come to me . Estelle , we 're on our way . Stay where you are , don 't go anywhere near them , do you understand ? Yes . CAT MIAOWS TWITTERING LAUGHTER Moses . CAT MIAOWS Oh , God , Moses , you silly cat . Come on , Moses . Come on , darling . Moses ! Come here , darling . Come on , puss . Moses ? Moses ! Oh , no ! Oh , no ! Oh ... Oh ! It makes no sense . It 's a fine night yet the weather map says there 's rain . ESTELLE MOANS AND GASPS Oh ! TWITTERING LAUGHTER Oh God ! RAPID BEATING OF WINGS Oh ! TWITTERING LAUGHTER Estelle ! Estelle ! HE BATTERS ON DOOR Estelle ! Looks like she died from drowning . The rest of the garden 's dry as a bone . It wasn 't your dad that was in love with her all those years ago , was it ? It was you . We once made a vow . We 'd be with each other till we died . HE KISSES HER HEAD HE SIGHS I need a drink . Where did you and Estelle meet ? In London at the Astoria ballroom a few weeks before Christmas . She was 17 years old and she was beautiful . I loved her at first sight . But nothing lasted back then . Promises were always being broken . Estelle ... to have to die like that . The petals in Goodson 's mouth , where had you seen that before ? Was that during the war ? No . Long before then . On a troop train . HARMONICA PLAYS 15 men with me in charge . MEN CHATTER AND LAUGH Everyone happy . Too happy . Too noisy . Then we hit a tunnel . FLAPPING OF WINGS We thought some birds had flown in through an open window . Then came the silence . And when we came out of the tunnel , all 15 men were dead . They 'd been suffocated . My squad . Men I was responsible for . But why were the men killed ? About a week earlier some of them had got drunk . Drove a truck through a village , ran over a child , killed her . That child was a chosen one . TWITTERING , FLAPPING OF WINGS DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE BEATING OF WINGS She 's a nightmare , three hours and wouldn 't say a word , just sat glowering because she thought I 'd nicked her special stapler . Don 't worry about it . You OK ? No . I 've had a bit of a weird day actually . Bloody hell ! What the hell 's gone on here ? How 'd they get in ? They smashed everything up , the bastards ! I 'll fetch you straight home from school , Jas . You don 't want to miss our party , do you ? I 'd rather play down the garden . You 're right . She 's spending too much time down there . Don 't worry . I 'm going to put a stop to things . So what are you going to do when they start building at the bottom of the garden ? It 'll happen one day . HE SIGHS Don 't you ever want to have a conversation with me ? BEATING OF WINGS No wonder your dad left when you were a baby . He must have seen what was coming . FLAPPING OF WINGS Who are you waving at ? Just friends . You don 't have friends . CHILDREN CHANT : Cross eyes , mince pies , catch the buggers by surprise . Jasmine ? Did someone push you , Jasmine ? Yes , Miss . Who ? Don 't know , Miss . Come here . In the whole of my working life I have never had to bring the bad times home with me . I have never had to feel threatened in my own home . But not any more , because this means these creatures can invade my life whenever they feel like it and I am scared , Jack . What chance did Estelle have ? What chance do any of us have ? You said these creatures protect their own . Yeah . You mentioned the chosen ones . What are they ? How many are there ? Tell me , Jack ! All these so-called fairies were children once from different moments in time , going back millennia . Part of the lost lands . Lost lands ? What ? The lands that belong to them . What exactly do they want ? Why are they here ? They want what 's theirs - the next chosen one . CHILDREN CAN BE HEARD SINGING 'LORD OF THE DANCE ' IN BACKGROUND Hey , you , did you tell on us ? No . Yes , you did . Yeah , well maybe you need a good kicking . Get those teeth of yours kicked in . SHE GASPS BEATING OF WINGS I want a check on all unexplained deaths in the area . What 's the weather forecast for today ? Long , sunny spells . It 's happening again . CHILDREN SING ' LORD OF THE DANCE ' IN BACKGROUND CHILDREN SCREAM I can 't understand it , it 's going crazy . Just leave it , let 's go . CHILDREN SCREAM Hold on to me ... SHE BECOMES INAUDIBLE BECAUSE OF WIND BEATING OF WINGS TYRES SCREECH WHIRRING OF WINGS , DEMONIC LAUGHTER I 've never seen anything like it . It was so sudden . Then it ... then it just ended . Kate , is it ? Was anyone hurt ? No . Two children were almost scared to death , but they 're OK . What is it ? I saw them . And there was little Jasmine in amongst it all . She hadn 't been touched . The sun was shining down on her . It was ... it was like an aura , like something protecting her . Who is Jasmine ? Jasmine Pearce . She 's a pupil of mine . Where is she now ? We 're sending all the children home . We have to . Yeah , thanks . The chosen one ? Yeah . MUSIC PLAYS , PEOPLE CHATTER Must have been scary at school today . It was fun . Roy said you saw some of your friends this morning . He said you waved at them . Only Roy said when he looked he couldn 't see anyone . That 's because they were in the trees . Trees ? What trees ? The trees along the road . Is this one of your games , Jas ? No . Ah , boy , not got a beer ? So who are they ? Just friends . You should have invited them to the party . They don 't like parties . I 'm not surprised if they live in trees . Oh , they don 't always live in trees . They can be anywhere and everywhere . They can even be in this room . In this room ? When ? Now . Don 't be silly , Jas . So where did you meet these friends ? You must have met them somewhere . They said they 'll always look after me , even through time . When did they say that ? I forget . Oh , yeah , I 've got big plans for this place , going to extend the patio and landscape this garden . Come on , Jas , hurry up with that food . People are hungry . So when are you going to name the day , Roy ? Shoo , never . I can 't afford to keep her . No ! No ! Please , no ! No ... Jas , get away . You can 't do this ! That 's my own place ! It 's mine ! I said , get away ! Oh , Jas ! Ow ! Ah ! You little bitch ! THUNDER RUMBLES THUNDER RUMBLES That 's all we need . Just a bit of bad weather . It 'll pass . Where 's Jas ? Oh , she 's around . Ladies and gentlemen ... Ladies and gentlemen , can I have your attention , please ? As you all know , today is a very special day - Lynn and me have been together now for the past five years , and not only is she my partner , but she 's also been my rock and my best friend . WOMAN : Aw ... Now we 're looking forward to having children of our own . WIND PICKS UP Oh my God ! GUESTS SCREAM IT HISSES No ! No ! No ! Get out ! No ! Roy ! IT LAUGHS HIDEOUSLY No ! Roy ! No ! LYNN : Roy ... ! LYNN SOBS No ! Oh , Roy ... No ! Do you know you 're walking in a forest ? Well , you are . It looks like a very old forest , and it 's magical . I want to stay in it . You can see this forest ? Yes . But it 's not here . It 's just an illusion , Jasmine . It is . WHIRRING OF WINGS Your friends are just playing a game with you . The real forest can never come back . Oh , it can . When they take me to it . They told you this ? But what about your mother ? Don 't you want to stay with her ? RUSTLING , ECHOING SOUND Come on . The child isn 't sure . I am sure . No ! Leave her alone . WHIRRING OF WINGS Find another chosen one . EERIE VOICES : Too late . She belongs with us . The child belongs here . No . She lives forever . Jas ? Where 's Jas ?

Come away , oh , human child ! Next time they 'll kill everyone at my school like they killed Roy and that man and your friend . How do you know these things ? If they want to they can make great storms , wild seas , turn the world to ice . Kill every living thing . Let me go . The child won 't be harmed ? Jack , you can 't ... Answer me ! She won 't be harmed ? We told you . She lives forever . A dead world . Is that what you want ? What good is that to you ? There will be no more chosen ones . EERIE VOICE : They 'll find us . Back in time . Take her . Jack , NO ! You asked me what chance we had against them . For the sake of the world , THIS is our only chance . EERIE VOICE : Thank you . SHE LAUGHS Jas ! Jas ! Jas , Jas ... Jas ! No ! No ! No ! No ! SHE SCREAMS INCOHERENTLY Jas ! SHE SOBS I 'm so sorry . What else could I do ? EERIE VOICES : Come away , oh , human child ! To the waters and the wild with a fairy hand in hand , for the world 's more full of weeping than you can understand . TWITTERING LAUGHTER 17 disappearances within the last five months . SCREAMING The rift is spreading and it 's dumping aliens and psychos wherever it fancies . Where is everybody ? Tosh ! SCREAMING Oh , my God . You can 't fight them , they 're too strong . Help me !

 It is always easy to see the end a nightmare . The front door is difficult to find . I think particularly in my case began with a storm . Guys , guys , you have to do this . There is fog everywhere , not can see beyond your nose . It 's so surreal . What is the problem ? It is raining a lot out there . Can not even see the other side of the boat . Do you think we will sink , captain ? Yes , start transmitting our position . I have to find a way out of this thing . They need a bit of fresh air . We knew it would be bad weather . - Right ? - Fresh air ? Yes , fresh air . In a figurative sense . - This is worse than a roller coaster . - How did worse than a roller coaster ? You love it ! - But hold much . - Nothing ever happened , right ? We took two weeks on this , not I think I can bear it . I get no response . Not get anything at 16 . - Hey , Stack ? - What is it ? Take a look . Wait , you know what you need ? They need a group photo . Do not you dare to ask us we say " X " . See ? That is the sense of humor that I seek . Well , let 's at 3 . Ready ? - 1 ... - What is it ? 2 ... 3 . Honey are you okay ? Yes , but I 'm a tremendous headache . What the hell happened ? Well , it seems that survived the storm . - Storm ? - Where are we ? Capi ... what is our position ? How far we San Juan ? The storm damaged the engine , not have electricity and no radar . Nothing , the barometer is round like a top . - I do not know what is going on . - Thank you . Hey , capi . - Yes ? - We are at the mercy of the water . Well , review the engine is probably something electrical . Dried up the reserves . They drank almost all the water before I could go down and stop them . The barometer is also screwed . We keep things between us ? Yes , sir . Land ! Thank God . What island is this ? You know what ? There should be no land for miles . Perhaps the storm in took the course . Are you sure you do not know our position ? It 's hard to say without the instruments . We have instruments ? He said it is difficult , not impossible . Stack is working to fix the engine . - Okay , Stack ? - Yes , sir . Anyway , it seems that the tide in is leading to the island . Finally some good news . Well , pull the anchor . I think she will resist . What do you think if we take the Zodiac and go to earth ? - Yes ! - Yes ! To me . The key is to replenish the our reserves of water . Without it we will not achieve get anywhere . You may stumble on piña colada there . My Times explorer prepared me . - Yes ? - Come here , I think I saw something . What ? - Like what ? - There in the water . - How was it ? - I do not know , great . - As a whale ? - No . - Maybe it was a shark . - No . You know what ? I 'll stay here . - What ? - Is that ... Wait , no , no , dear . It was a crazy night , you 'll be fine . - Do not believe me . - Karen , do not you get off the boat ? - Yes , but ... - Wait , wait . Why are not you too ? Two . No , I 'm with you guys . The accursed shark is not going to stop me to feel the sand on my skin . Okay , fine . I 'll stick with it . No , no , you will . I 'll be fine . You can stay but I need of all possible hands . Then all men will to the land . - I love you . - Take care . Be right back . Take care . You see that ? It is a flag . Loaded . Closes pulls the precursor . Place on top of your head and shoot . We will see the signs and know that is bad . And if you are having problems ? Well .. back as soon as possible . Immediately . So I like . No more boats , no more boats . - They can pass , we ... - Here , Romeo . Hours . - Come on . - I want to stay here . Come on , get up . Remember where we came from , You see that hill ? This is your job . What is happening here . Hey , Stack ? Yes ? Go up and look around to find where we have to go . All right , captain . See why keep him around . Stack is more useful than can imagine in an environment like this . Fantastic . All your effort is give me head . Where the hell you been ? - Thank you . - She 's fine . That view is here ! There are some birds on the East . - Wait ! - This is a good sign . Animals usually indicate that there is water . Hey , Stack , down . We go there . The flag ! What ? The flag ! Oh , my God ! Oh , shit ! Wait ! You can not go out like running . What ? What the heck is that ? Crap ! Move ! Come on , guys . Let 's try to stay together . - Run . - Go , go ! Let 's run to where ? Where is it ? Where is the boat ? The Zodiac is also gone . Was right here ! Take it easy , okay ? We are in jungle , after seeing these eggs ... We have to leave this island ! - Would you relax ? - Karen took the boat ! Karen did not take the boat ! Perhaps the anchor has been detached . - The flag . - What ? The flag ! That 's what the Stack was shouting at the top . The flag ! We are exposed here . We have to go to the trees . Yes , go to the trees . We have to go . - Wait , wait ! - The boat is not here . Come ! Come ! It seems a good place to stay . What about your friend ? - Honey ... - Do not call me darling now . - Let 's calm down . - I have to continue . What are we doing here ? Gotta go ... - What is this place ? - We can not go back . Captain and now ? Look ... we know that the Haiti ... - ... But do not come to San Juan . - San Juan ? Not seen any of those things that smashed your friend ... - ... In the package of Puerto Rico . - Please . What ? What ? All this was your fault . - If something happens in ... - It 's all a lie , ok ? Just calm down , Lindsay . Stay here , do not run away . ... first instance . Probably is derived from somewhere . ... let 's save our lives first . A knife is all . Thou Lindsay stay here . The captain and I will find this thing that took the Stack . No , no , we should be together . We do not know what is out there , Lindsay want to get hurt . - Are you okay ? - Yes - And if not come back ? - I 'll be back . Collect anything that you can burn to score a fire after dark . I will not spend the night in this place . You remember when we were skiing and broke my ankle ? And you helped me to return the mountain ? Yes , you fainted by time . Now we 're on that mountain . I 'll be back . Hey , it helps a little help here . Ross ... I regret what I said . - What ? - That this was all your fault . It was not your fault . Or rather , most was your fault . The barometer was not damaged . What ? The barometer of the boat is not that he was not working well . Ross , really need you to control here . What led the Stack lived during the period of pre-history of this planet when was the level of oxygen higher . The sufficiently high keep the animals of this size . Even more so . Cole , that 's a Tyrannosaurus . Ross , I want to go home . We need more wood . - What do you think ? - Why do not we give back ? Since when do you know Ross ? - There are some 15 years . - Ah ... are now friends . We work together . I just wanted to know ... If we go back ... you know ... to Key West ... Maybe you could pay me a little more money ? Good luck . Fill it there . Look at this ! Cole takes a look at this ! - Did you see that ? - It was incredible . She could have shit on me . That was funny . You better ... back before dark . Picked . Hey , Cole looks , no pets back . There is fresh meat . - I think it should go . - Yes , we . Go , go . Hurry , hurry . Take a large piece . Oh , my God . Flawless ! Come on , captain ! Oh , shit ! Come ! Get down , Get down . - What ? - Where was it ? Maybe hiding . No , wait . And if he is hiding ? No , no , come on . We can not stay here . Why would he so without more or less ? - Oh , my God . - What is this place ? Where are we ? So what 's the plan , Ross ? We shift to keep the fire burning . And hopefully in the morning find Karen . I 'm so hungry ... I eat dinosaur . I do not think you can continue long in this place . Do not worry , we will find Karen . I hope so . Oh , I wish both touching me . Sometimes the eggs are sufficient . But I 'm so hungry could eat a horse . Who are you ? Sorry , you sleepyhead . I think you missed the presentations . - I 'm Jude . - Jude Jackson . This is Joe . Does not talk much but is great to hear . Where the hell are we ? That is the question of 1 million dollars . We are in a hole if understand what I say . Never heard of this place . Even in flight school . How long you been here ? 1 year , 2 months and 11 days . Who 's counting , right ? Thank you . I 'll tell you one thing is not an easy task survive here . Spend the day without turning the lunch someone is like a meeting with the Andrew Sisters , know what I mean ? This is a tremendous find ! We have many women here . I had a that appeared when I here but did not last long . Should be the group that came the boat , right ? - The boat ? - Did you see the boat ? Yes , here is a boat like an egg Easter for an orphan . Where ? It 's a little difficult . I do not care how hard it is . My wife is in the boat , I to find it now . Reach the boat requires all your skills . I 'll take you to him . But I can not promise that is still there . Maybe not to return is not an easy game . Mind if I get one ? Let . Know ? Survival is the highest capacity . I can not believe that brought no weapon . Only knives ? We would not fight a war . Repeats . This is where I landed in small island paradise . I left one arm in the process . I was hanging there as an ornament Christmas , until I found . It was there that I met Joe . Everything is gathered here some part of the island . Is more like a small museum . Crap ! Oh , it 's Conrad . Conrad ... staff . Hello - Where are they ? - What ? I 'm from Manhattan . - What year ? - Yes , I also thought he was crazy . Maybe he and I also . Conrad was the captain of a boat called " Connemora " Were on board the Connemora ? Yes , excellent boat . It was rescued in 1955 . You are 54 years here ? 10 years and 311 days . Feel that smell ? Feel that smell ? - This is the oil ? - Get out of the ground . I 'll never know this place as well as Conrad . You are going to guide us ? Great . How far we will take a crazy ... ? Perhaps not so crazy as you think . So Jude , where you found our boat ? Just like the others on the beach . But I knew that there people in it . Know ? If you have a boat , why do not you use off the island ? It is impossible . Believe me , I tried and almost became a snack the children 's mother live in the depths . Wait a minute , what ? There it is . There is something that bothers me . What kind of plane you said which drivers ? TBL avenger , flight 19 . Did you know that the whole squad Flight 19 disappeared in 1945 ? Yes , two weeks before I make 26 years . He had planned a tremendous party when he returned to base . Wait a moment . You were on Flight 19 and him in Connemora . Affirmative . What ? We passed an area where always thought it was fiction . Known as the Devil 's Triangle . Wait , we crossed the Triangle Bermuda ? I thought that was not been proven , something like the invention . Friend , we have dinosaurs . Flight 19 and Connemora . Disappearances well proven . We have gone through a portal . Something . Come on , we are wasting time . Let us search for the Karen . This thing ? You 're kidding , as know if it floats ? Let us know . Trust me . Let . Give me your hand ! - Where is he ? - What happened ? Go get it ! - There it is . - Come on ! - Give me your hand . - Come on . Help him . - He will get it ! - Give me your hand ! - Come on . - Get him . What the hell was that ? - Honey . - What was that ? Come on , let 's get out of here . - What was that ? - Are you okay ? You okay ? - I am , I 'm fine . - Can you continue ? Yes , we . You will not leave your friend to rest ? - Why ? - He 's fine . - He 's fine , okay ? - Yes We have to go looking my wife and to make sure you are well . Ok , let 's go . Flawless . Oh , my God . - Is it better not to see us . - Ok So let 's take only what is necessary . This means that our boat may be around anywhere . Could be . Just keep your eyes open and all the rest closed . - Ok - Come on . Who are they ? Germans . I do not think they are the that kick in the butt . Seized this part the island since they arrived . Let me go ! Karen . Let me go . Relax , we must have a plan , okay ? In any way , we will . - Let me go . - Conrad know how to go back ... that 's how we got the gunpowder . We 'll get your wife . - Come on . - Okay . Hey , there 's nothing that juice yellow ? It is a good idea . Here . - What are you doing ? - We need lighting . Unless you want to go blind . I will not go there . Look , my friend said that this the cave will take up the Germans so , you can go with us or stay here . But you 'll be on your own . Everyone keep your head down and not make noise . There are many of these around . It 's okay . Let . Here is the output . Yes , let 's take it safely we need a distraction . You know , get them out of somehow . Forward . Okay , I 'll tell we do . Conrad and I will give back ahead to draw your attention . The rest come in and take she this place . There are weapons there , then once she is safe grab what they can to charge of soldiers . I have an idea , I 'll take Conrad and Jude and if I can go for my boat so I can prepare you to escape quickly . Wait , wait , that distractions ? It will be something that will not unnoticed . Okay , just be careful , ok ? Thank you . I 'm going back to Karen . Captain , stay here and watch the boat . Just got back . What we do with these German idiots , ah , Conny ? We have no weapons . We need something ... to keep everyone busy . And that gives us the opportunity to take care of them , ... if you understand me . How are you of your leg ? If he could dance with whom . - Would you enjoy it ? - Come on . Jesus . Better find a place , Conny . I do not want behind me . So when running mean something , if you understand what I mean . What are you waiting for ? Lukas ! I have lived long in this island to miss this opportunity . Now we are alone . If you kill each other . Let . Not a good idea . Hey , what are you doing ? They took my boat . Stop , Lonzo , stop . Run , they took my boat . Let . Let 's get the boat . They took my boat . Hey ! What are you doing ? Hey ! Come back ! We can all go us ! Come back ! Come back ! Let . Stopped . Stops . It 's just blood , my , it 's just blood . Hey , guys , this is not blood . Hey , just because you cry , do means that you understand , idiots . They speak very little English . And I speak very little German , then we are in it . Touché . You speak very well . I 'm still an idiot ? I studied 3 years at the University of Cambridge before the war ... Did you know that the war fought ended long ago ? What do you mean by that the war is over ? Listen , you came in diving , right ? I and many others as they could see the cemetery . Listen , there may be a way all leave here . What are you talking about ? Get down The old Conrad said there was oil here and that old T-Rex the tracked so far . So ... if you find that T-Rex may be the only way we leave this island . But we must work together . First we have to end job . Where you going ? Be right back . Stay here , I you to stay safe . What about you ? I 'll be back soon . Do not go . From what we saw , extremely dangerous . We gave him the name of Kriegsnarbe . Means " scar " . He fought hard . And more than half of the island is its territory . We have special regard for him . Protect your back . Hey ! Oil . Zander , Zander . Oil . Hey , Hey , Frost . And if we get there ? It 's fast . Oh , yes , this is good . Crap . Come on . Let . Ok , let 's . Come on . Quick , quick . And now what , sir ? Now ... Now ... Now ... Now comes the dangerous part . Okay . Apparently this device can be distilled alcohol . What is not much . No , actually we have to heat the oil to separate its components . Gas is up and gasoline in the background . Petrol ... Diesel . Pour the oil here . In theory if we apply heat . The oil will be distilled , and will through this copper pipe . Here , here . And will end this reservoir cooling . Obviously we can not control much heat , so I have to explain to them what happens when oil is very hot ... Exactly . So I think we should much room for it . I think we should work in shifts and start right now . - Everything is ready . - Lonzo . Personnel . Personnel . We had to remove it from the camp and now we are completely exposed to everything . You might want to go with the others until at least know how this works . We are sure together . Wow . Yes , wow . Okay . The honor is all yours . God help us . Yes With music all is bearable , even weeks below the sea . What would be missing for this submarine working again ? Require more gallons of we use for this ... Suppose we get fuel . Some simple repairs . Judging by the moon , high tide will in one or two weeks . You want to try to go on a submarine ? It may be the best opportunity we have . First we have to charge a big problem . That 's not what I said ? - I understand . - It 's okay . Why not hunted the T-Rex ? We tried . Our weapons were not much damage mainly to a safe distance . When you are injured , are still more dangerous . We have to destroy it altogether . How long do you think it takes ? Know ? I have an idea . As a child , my father used some tricks , fireworks to scare the deer the fields of hay . I know it scared a T-Rex is very more dangerous to dismiss a deer from a field of hay , but can use anything ... gunpowder , smoke , explosives , any thing to do a lot of noise . We hypotheses . We must follow the advice of ancestors . They were smoking in places steep . We would do the same thing . Would use explosives to attract the T-Rex . Somehow we need to take it to the oil tank on the beach . What this island is so great for down something that size ? We have to be lucky , to be precise . But if we succeed , we access to all the oil we need . There is only one problem , as we able to remove the T-Rex ? He 's right . When you use the explosive to him out of his lair will ignite all the oil . We will not survive . True . I will instruct me to get him . Come on , lagartixão . Now ! Hey ! Hey , come ! Lindsay ! Now ! Run ! Run ! Come ! - Come on ! - No ! Hey . I know that now you want to be alone but have to be careful to walk alone here , is very dangerous . He hugged me and made me feel I was not alone . I do not know is can not believe he 's gone . It makes no sense . It 's not fair but we opened the door , Linds , as it always did . Everyone has to try harder to get out of it . You have to do your part . I need you for this . You 're not alone . I 'll wait outside . We 'll have to dig , dig and dig . We 'll have to dig much . We will have to remove the sand from base throughout the submarine . He said he would dig up the hell thereby return to his girlfriend . If we get enough sand for down , water from the base the high tide to move it from sand to the sea . When we realize that engines have linked we can empty the tanks ballast and put a floor . His girlfriend ... she you may have aged much . It may even be dead . The world is different from as the left . I have a wife and a son . There are many great mysteries , captain . We must not lose opportunities that are before us . You have a man ? Yes Oh , my God . - Okay , I think I can do it . - Let me teach you something . Here , here . Come . We finish on time ? Yes , I think so . We need a lot of oil when we take the sand and drown in the sea . Just let us have a chance when we take the ballast . Other than that , you have to to worry about . All supplies are exhausted , water , food , everything . When we take the ballast will not be back . Now we have high tide . But they are bringing the fuel right now . We need to sink now . We can only hope that the food reaches us . The tide does not wait , man . The tide rose , it 's now or never . Let 's get it out of the sand . - Remove the weights . - Now ! Wait . Wait , wait , they do not back yet . Lonzo ! Come . Lonzo ! We have to go to the submarine . Let . Liga engines . We are moving us . We did it ! What ? What did he say ? It seems that Frost does able to return . I think we lost . - Karen ! Karen ! - I was here a minute ago . Frost . Hey . You okay ? It 's too late , they were . Why do not you go with them ? Not without you . We may never know if the attempt was successful and the submarine could escape this place . Perhaps someday , someone come here as we and went home again . Meanwhile , life goes on time passes . Even in this place lost , forgotten by the world , ... we can build a house . Finish my story and send it in bottle to any destination reminds me that whenever we are starting . May God bless us on this journey . Frost Michaels .

It could have been worse . - well , hey , wait , wait . myka , myka , myka . - yeah ? - look , i was talking to your dad . He thinks you 're still in d.c. they both do . - well , yeah . And if you tell them any differently , i swear , I will--i will drop a dictionary on your crotch .

I don 't know. something to cut the stress . - i 'm not stressed . - you 're lying to them . - it 's a force of habit , you know ? It keeps my dad from being disappointed . You have hot sauce all over your face . [ eerie whispering ] [ eerie whispering ] - [ screams ] - dad ! Mom ? - myka , get back . - dad ? - watch your eyes . - oh ! [ electricity crackles ] - warren. warren . What happened ? - what happened is ... Your dad 's got an artifact . - myka ! Myka ! hey ! - where 's the notebook ? - it 's this way . - myka ? - mom , it 's okay . - myka , who is it ? is she- this is claudia . we work with her . - what 's that ? - that is- claudia , back here . - that 's for me . - no , you wait just a minute . I want some answers , myka . Now , first of all , who is the man in the little tv ? - his name is artie . - and is he a doctor ? - no , but- your father belongs in a hospital . - this isn 't medical. mom , this is something else . - and how do you know ? you 're not a doctor . You protect the president . - not anymore . I 'm still with the government , but i am doing this now . - what ? what are you doing ? - i 'm trying to help dad , mom , so just let me do that . Trust me . please . - ready ? - yeah . Um , mom , just stay here . Whatever you see or hear , just stay put . - but- - - just don 't move . - do- it 'll be okay . They do this kind of stuff all the time , so- claudia ? - i gotta- but what 's going on ? - they 're really good at this . - [ groans ] - here it is . - kill it . - duck and cover . - what 's happening ? - mom , how 's dad ? - um , he 's the same . Why , was something supposed to happen ? - check his arms . - it 's still there . - it 's ink . ink . Take it out . - now what ? - the neutralizer failed Because i think we 're dealing with a bifurcated object . It 's--it 's got at least two parts , And they 're each dependent on the other . And , uh , that notebook is just one half of the package . - so what 's the other half ? - you know , based on the manifestations of the ink , Then that would tell me that it 's a pen , Most like--well , a pen , anyway . Oh , by the way , the shipper 's address ? That 's completely phony . - macpherson sent it , didn 't he ? - [ sighs ] i don 't know that . - so what ? he 's coming after family now ? - what does he want ? - well , he wants to hurt us , Because we 're going after him . - stop , stop , stop , stop . Just stop it. we don 't know who sent it or why . If it is macpherson , it could be revenge or mischief Or a diversion so that we 're doing this While he 's doing something else . Just in case , just to be safe , i 've , uh- - I 'm circling the wagons around joshua And around pete 's family . Who or why does not matter . What matters is your father and the notebook . Now--now , listen . I 've analyzed the text . it ain 't good. it 's poe . Um , edgar allan poe . The reason that the book is getting under your father 's skin Is because the pen is not with it . - so , what ? we bring the pen together with the notebook And this all stops ? - yeah . Well , probably , If it follows a typical bifurcated artifact scenario . It can 't be an accident That this book found its way to your dad . Look , uh , myka , right now your father is a conduit . The notebook , the pen , they 're linked through his energy , Through his love of the written word . - so where is this pen ? - well , i 'm searching for coinciding incidents right now . Uh , you know , i 've got the filters off . - but it 's causing trouble somewhere ? - but i 'll find it . you 'll get it . The next time he has an attack , i 'll trace the pen . You 'll retrieve it and reunite it with the notebook . - how long does he have ? - i don 't know what you- - how long--what ? - how long does he have ? Artie , my father can 't take this much longer . - um ... [ stutters ] A day . maybe two . But you can help him . Until i land on something , myka , Just surround him with his books , with his world , And read to him , myka , read to him books that he loves And use those words to fight what 's happening to him . And just try to keep him connected to reality if you can . - bobby 's not that bad . - look , all i 'm saying is , watch out . [ both laugh ] Geek love. ugh ! - " i might have been improved for my whole life . " i might have been made another creature , perhaps , For life , by a kind word , at that season ... " - do you want me to take over ? - no , no . i 'm--i 'm fine . He 's gonna be okay , mom . - um ... Oh . I 'll be back in a sec . I 'm just gonna take these dishes . - freak 's probably swiped your panties From gym class or something . - gross ! - tiger . - dad ? - tiger , stop it . - fire . - dad ? - fire ! [ all screaming ] - dad ? [ screaming ] Help , somebody get some help . - artie 's got something . - what ? - at the precise moment your dad was shouting " fire , " A kid in portland , oregon , was burned By some bizarre wall of flame shooting from his locker . No one can explain it . - well , what about the tiger thing ? - kid 's a football star for the kingford tigers . - let 's go . - wait , myka . I need you to stay here . - i have to help my dad , pete . - i know , but we 've got two artifacts . He 's connected to one . I need you to stay on the notebook . I 'll take care of the pen . Myka , look at me . No one can help your dad right now more than you can . - i can 't let you go alone . - i 'll take claudia . - keep her safe . - yeah . But there 's something else . - what ? - i think i 'm hot for your mom . - i 'll break it to dad . - okay . - i needed to speak with you , bobby . Is , uh- - is everything okay ? The poetry inspiring you ? - not so much . - you know , it seems We had a little burglary here the other day . The story is that it was one of the pens That edgar allan poe used . - oh , he used it . Don 't look at me like that . - i noticed that you were fascinated with the pen . - are you saying i took it ? Are you saying i took it ? - i 'll tell you what . I 'm gonna go to the lounge for a soda , And if the pen should show up while i 'm gone , Well , we 'll just chalk it up To something strange and mysterious . Back in a bit . - mr. ives . mr. ives . Here . - " wall " ? " wall " ? " wall " what ? - you . [ eerie whispering ] - [ screaming ] - [ moaning ] - really ? does he like horror novels ? Stephen king , lovecraft , poe ? - you 're assuming the boy reads . no , he 's just a bully . Look , i mean , how big a deal is this ? I mean , this school 's got a reputation to maintain , And if it gets out That the government 's investigating a teenage prank , It 'll put a lot of parents off . - you mean donors ? - why do you think it 's just a prank ? - well , we 're not schooling little terrorists here . Somebody in the science class got tired Of parmut picking on him and gave him a hotfoot . - oh , yeah ? how 's he doing ? - he 's fine . uh , you want this open ? - no. we 'll , uh , we 'll take it from here . - you 'll want to step back , please . - why ? it 's not dangerous . - please . Thank you . Okay . you ready ? - why not ? - okay , we 're in business . here we go . So , uh , you had any other incidents ? - with what , fire ? - well , anything strange . Say a tell-tale heart , perhaps ? - what ? - there you go . - gotta love artie . - what 's that ? - you don 't happen to have Edgar allan poe 's pen lying around , would you ? - well , actually- - - yes ? - mr. ives ' classroom . He likes to collect items from famous people . - the pen is here , then . - well , it was . um , it got stolen . - [ murmurs ] - this last one was the worst . - i know . - [ murmuring ] - dad ? - if you 'd been a boy i 'd have called you sue . - what ? - johnny cash . it 's a song . a boy named sue . - okay . - make you tough . - well , i 'm sorry i wasn 't a boy . - i 'm sorry i wasn 't a father . [ groans ] - he has regrets . - about me ? - yes . About his life . - what do you mean ? - he wanted to write books . - i know. i know that he wanted to write books . - did you know he wrote a novel ? - no . - 12 times . over and over again . Unpublished . He loved it too much to let it go . He was afraid . - where is it ? - a long time ago , when he finally gave up ... [ exhales ] he told me to burn it . He hasn 't written a thing since . - [ moans ] It can 't be . - mr. ives ? Hello ? - nice place for a pen , soaking up all that poe juice . - huh . - do you know that ravens are actually brilliant ? They 've adapted to humans like rats and cockroaches . They 've figured out how to figure us out . - shh . - what ? - shh .

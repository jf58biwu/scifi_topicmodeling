 Previously on Heroes ... My dad lied to me about my entire life . My biological parents . My ability . You can 't just hide things like that . A 21-year-old woman was killed in the explosion . Also killed in the fire was her 18-month-old daughter . Hi , I 'm looking for someone related to Meredith Gordon . - This is her . - Mom ? Where are you taking us ? Tell your boss I 'm on very important mission . It can take years to integrate a multiple personality , but if you let me , I can help you . What I am , you can 't fix . Who are you ? How can you see me ? I don 't know , I can just do what you can do . I 'm the Invisible Man . I 'm Claude Rains . Now get away from me . I found you . I need you to help me . This entire city is in danger . You seem pretty sure about that pending apocalypse of yours . How many people have you taught before me ? If he crashes , you bring him back . Again and again . He 's dead . Well , that 's less than ideal . Subtitle Added By MohammaD [ shock ] Season 1 , Episode 14 [ Distractions ] I don 't see how petty theft is part of my training . There 's a lot you don 't see . You 've no idea how to use these gifts of yours properly . - Yeah , and you do ? - No , I ... Right now , your abilities only show up as a reflex . Autonomic , like swallowing . That 's a dog 's trick . Making it a conscious choice , using it , that 's what makes you more than poodle . Is insulting me really gonna help me learn how to do that ? Listen , you 're the one who 's a bomb set to blow up me and everyone in this city unless I can get you housebroken . That 's right , now he 's listening . Now , you absorb all these abilities you find , yeah ? You 're invisible with me , you 've flown , you 've read some minds . Yeah , put me in a coma for two weeks . Your body doesn 't know what to do with them all . It 's gotten jumbled , like file cards knocking around a shoebox . Except with you , the cards are dowsed in plutonium , piling up to a critical mass . Now , I 'm gonna teach you how to pull ' em out , one at a time . You think that 's possible ? I hope so . Next time you shut down , it might not be just a coma . Might be the day you melt down . - So then , let 's get to today 's lesson . - All right , let 's start by seeing if you can hold on to one of your powers without your benefactors hanging around . You think I can do that alone ? We 're about to find out . Remember to breathe . Hey ! Subtitle Added By MohammaD [ shock ] Season 1 , Episode 14 [ Distractions ] God , it sounds like a bomb is about to go off . I know it 's hard . Just focus on the mirror and try to relax . I can 't relax . - You 're trying to bring her out . - Jessica ... I told you . She is dangerous . - She could hurt you . - Tell me . Those cuffs could keep an elephant in that chair . And just ' cause I 'm a shrink , don 't think I don 't know how to use that Taser . I thought that the goal was to get rid of her . The goal here is to bring your two halves to a healthy middle . To have a unified and whole you . Not two aspects at war . How do we do this ? Like I said , you focus on the reflection . And breathe . Come on . Feel free to let your mind wander . We used to have a piano in our home . You played ? Chopsticks , barely . - My sister ... - Jessica . She played beautifully . I used to ... play with her sheet music . I didn 't ... know what it was . It was just ... dots and lines . I would ... get out my crayons and connect the dots . Jessica used to say ... that I could turn Mozart into a monkey . - I sure did . - Jessica . You should have listened to the little mouse . How 's Claire ? That was for the haircut . You shouldn 't have built such a good cage . You go anywhere near her ... No ! No ! Noooo ! You didn 't just used your key this time . I shouldn 't have them . Not anymore . You started painting since you got back from rehab . Can I see ' em ? That 's not done yet ! Oh , God . That 's the roof of my father 's building . We had a lot of good memories up there . Is that how you remember our relationship ? With all of New York destroyed ? What are you looking for , Simone ? It 's Peter . He 's still missing . I 'm running out of places to look . You finally believe I can paint the future , and you want to use it to find your new boyfriend . I don 't wanna be asking you this either . - Can you ? - I have been . Except it 's not working . Every time I try to paint where Peter is , I get nothing . You 've been trying to find him ... why ? I know what he can do . He 's the one that 's gonna turn New York into this . I 'm not gonna let him . - How do you know so much about him ? - Because I painted it . I care about you , Simone , more than I knew how to say when ... when it would have made a difference . But right now , I don 't care if you hate me . I just want you safe . Stay away from Peter . Just ... tell me you 'll look for him . I 'll try . Yeah . Simone ... Keep the key . The manatee is on the brink of extinction . There 's one at the aquarium in Lubbock , and the marine biologist said we could stop by any time . You 're asking my permission to skip school ? No , if I wanted to skip school , I 'd check into home room and then sneak out Ms. Roberts ' window . But you 've always stressed honesty , so I 'm being honest . The manatee 's a very noble creature . Is your car in working order , Zachary ? - Just had the oil changed . - Any tickets ? Just parking . - You 'll be home for dinner . - Yes . That 's not a question . I 'm making fajitas . Zach , you 're welcome to join us . Let 's go . Come on . We 'll wait 15 minutes , and then head out . - Do you have the directions to Kermit ? - Uh , yeah . Look , what if your mom wants proof ? About the aquarium . - Where did you get these ? - Motel 6 lobby and my color printer . No one can know we 're going to see my real mom . We have to be perfect . Get a doctor ! Oh ... wait . What happened ? No ! No ! No ! I tried to tell her . - Take me back to my cell ! - Love to ! Thanks for almost getting me arrested . A little more focus , you 'd have had some cash and fresh lipstick . I never said it 'd be easy . In fact , I think I said repeatedly it 'd be crap . You been doing this for 15 years . Cut me a little slack on trying to do it for five minutes . You 'll learn . We just gotta find what 's holding you back . The cops have my name and address . I 'm pretty sure Nathan 's gonna kill me first anyway . You worry a lot about your people , don 't you ? Your friends , your mother , your brother . No wonder your head 's all clogged . You 're still sunk under . - Under what ? - Your attachments . All these people who feed you biscuits , pat your head , and tell you you 're not fit for the outdoors . You still see yourself through their eyes , is that it ? - No , I don 't . - Right , well , I 'll bet you 20 bucks your dad didn 't make much of you either . Ha ! God , you 're easy . We 've gotta get these people out of your head . Do you understand ? These people are my family . I can 't just cut ' em out . Peter can 't use his powers without someone holding his hands . How can you not punch that face every time you see it ? - He 's not like that . - He is , trust me . - You don 't know him . - I don 't need to . I spend a lot of time moving around people 's homes , their bedrooms . You get to know people if you see them when they think they 're alone . You see them for what they truly are : selfish , deceitful , and gassy . So what is that , your big truth about the world ? Sooner you learn it , sooner we get that collar off your neck . People suck , friend . Every last one of them . Never forget that . Not all of them . Oh , right . There 's a girl . She 's not like the rest of them . Everyone 's like the rest . That 's why they 're the rest . Fine , let 's go and see what your girl 's up to . Then maybe we can clear your head . Wait , you wanna ... spy on her ? Look , you can follow her all you want . I 'm telling you , she 's not like that . Well , then , no harm in taking a look . This is it . Number 36 . Nice pinwheel collection . You know , I always imagined my parents would live in a ... penthouse in New York City . Not some trailer park in Kermit . So she lives in a trailer . Maybe she likes the open road . Just not what I imagined . Stop imagining . She 's right there . What am I supposed to say ? " Hi , I 'm your daughter , and I can regrow my kidney " ? I mean , what if she 's got burns and scars from the fire ? She 's supposed to be dead , right ? So are you , remember ? You already got that in common . Hey ... where are you going ? I 'm getting rid of your exit strategy . You 'll be fine . I 'll be back in time for fajitas . Claire ? Hi , little Fluffy . Claire home from school yet ? No ? We 'll just wait . Now , what 's your name ? Mr. Muggles ? Where are you , baby ? Mama 's home ! Of course . Let 's go say hi . I-I 'm sorry . Who are you ? I just came from the paper factory , ma 'am . I 'm just makin ' a delivery for your husband . And I saw ... this little guy ... in the street . Now , somebody must have left the back door open . Oh , I hope you don 't mind . I took the liberty . Well , aren 't you sweet ? And he was just out there in the yard ? Oh ... just chewin' on a sprinkler head . Mm ! Who left those doors open , Mr. Muggles ? Claire or Lyle ? You tell me , so I can tan their ass . Well , thanks for inviting ' me in . I always wanted to , uh , see where Mr. Bennett lived . It is so funny how all of y 'all call him Mr. Bennett over there . I 've always just known him as ... Stop that , you . No more shoes . He just discovered shoelaces . Can 't get enough . That 's funny , I never really imagined him as much of a dog person . I guess he just looms a little larger when he 's drilling ' you . He mostly talks about Claire . I was hopin ' to meet her , actually . I 've heard so much about her . Well , she has promised to be home for dinner . Which means a half an hour late . My son is at a Tai Kwon Do sleepover tonight . That means an extra plate . Why don 't you stay for dinner ? Least I can offer my new hero . Are you sure ? It 's not too much trouble ? I will call my husband and tell him to expect you . - What did you say your name was again , Mister ... - Sylar . Oh , I don 't think you 'll reach him at the office , though . Last I saw , he was just swamped . I 'm staring . I 'm sorry . I mean , you have to understand . I never thought this would happen . You sitting inches away from me . You 're so beautiful . Thank you . You a good student ? Um , I 'm okay . - Lousy at math . - No help from me there . Well , I 'll bet you 're all kinds of popular . I was homecoming queen . Kind of . Damn , I missed so much . If I 'd known you were out there , but ... You must think something awful . I mean , I was so sure that nothing could have survived that fire . It was a miracle that I did , and ... God , when I saw that roof , I ... Don 't question the miracle , right ? Here . It 's horchata . I learned a secret recipe in Mexico . It 's sweet . - You lived in Mexico ? - Mm-hmm . Oh , I moved around a lot . After I lost you , I sort of started running . I never really stopped . And I only came back to Kermit a couple months ago . I spent some time in Cuernavaca . And La Paz . You 've never been . Well ... Sorry . It 's my mom . Hi ! Yeah , we 're at the aquarium right now . They just let Zach feed him turtle grass . We 're practically on our way . We 'll be home in , like , an hour . No , I won 't let him speed . Okay . Bye . She doesn 't know you 're here . She doesn 't really understand what 's going on with me right now . Neither of my parents do . Well , I 'll pretend I understand why you 're sneaking around . All girls deserve their secrets , right ? Seems like I have a lot of them these days . I have to show you something . You may understand it , you may not , but ... - I need you to see . - See what ? I think I know how I survived that fire . - Claire , don 't ! - It 's okay . Please say something . Some family . I told Claire to get a move on . She said she 'd be back soon . A cheerleader , huh ? - Co-captain by junior year . - Wow . Although not so much these days . They dissolved the team ' cause of some ... horrible event at the school . Oh , I heard about that . That must have been hard on poor Claire . You are awfully interested in my daughter . Well , ever since I seen what she can do , I guess you could say I 'm a ... fan . She 's really quite gifted . Oh , you 've been to a game ? Yeah , I guess I have . I just couldn 't get over those irresistible ... talents of hers . I should ... I should check with my husband again . Excuse me . I 'd rather you didn 't so I can surprise him . - H-h-how did you do that ? - I 'm special . Just like Claire . Well , different . But ... you catch the meaning . It 's a shame I 'll have to kill her . Or maybe I 'll kill you first . I really haven 't decided yet . Hi . Find him . He dies ! I don 't understand what happened . Why was he ... he moved the phone - without even touching it . - Shh . You 're safe now . I 'm right here . I 'll find him . He kept asking about Claire . Claire is fine . She 's safe too . And she 'll stay that way . I promise . - Who is that ? - This is my friend . He 's gonna make everything okay . He 'll help you forget again . Again ? What do you mean again ? It 's okay . Hold my hand . It 'll all be over soon . You could stay a little longer . Have some dinner . I can 't cook worth crap , but ... Well , I was supposed to be home a while ago . I got about six messages from my dad telling me to come home right away , so ... He sounded pretty pissed . This isn 't good-bye . You know that . I was hoping you could tell me about my father . Now , that 's ... complicated . Why don 't you let me work on that for next time ? Some family . Here ... A little something from Mexico . Oh , no , I can 't . You can , and you 're gonna . It 'll look ten times better on you than it ever did on me . Okay . Isaac . We haven 't been up here together in a long time . There 's something about this roof . You and I spent a lot of time up here . I mean , it 's connected with what 's happening . - It 's important somehow . - Well , it 's certainly mysterious . You know , I never figured out how those pigeons got up here . My father always said , " If they found their way , we ought to let ' em be . " I know we had a lot together , Isaac . For a long time . You saw it . The painting of us . It 's the future I still hope for . This city took me in . Everything important that ever happened to me happened here . Good ... bad ... you . And now it 's all gonna be destroyed because I can 't stop it . You don 't know that . It keeps coming back , worse every time . You saw what this looks like after the bomb . The world will never recover from that . That 's not true . You can 't lose hope . - What hope is there ? - There 's you . What you can do . Why else would you be allowed to see the future unless it was to do something about it ? You can 't just see the future , Isaac . You make it . You 'll find a way . You really believe that ? I believe in you . - Get dressed ! - Dressed for what ? You 're going home . - That 's not possible . - Oh , it 's more than possible . The charges against you have been dropped , Ms. Sanders . What ? The D.A. threw out the entire case . That can 't happen . I killed people . The state of Nevada isn 't so sure about that anymore . It seems a rather terrible gentleman on death row confessed to all the crimes you 're accused of . DNA evidence backed up everything . Wonderful system , isn 't it ? As far as they 're concerned , justice has been served . And as far as Linderman is concerned ? Oh , don 't worry about tomorrow 's problems today . No . I need to be in here . I need help . You only need to get dressed , Ms. Sanders . You 're going home . And that 's the one you love . Off to dinner with the guy she left to be with you . Sort of fickle , don 't you think ? Why would you show me that ? I didn 't show you anything . She did . We just followed her . Not even very long . - I 'm sorry , Peter . - No , you 're not . You enjoyed that . You got this rosy film over your eyes , like a kid . It 's no wonder you live like an adolescent . Posters on the wall , hair in your face . You 've got to see the world as it is . The only way you 'll learn how to save it . And what , be like you ? A hermit ? No one knows you 're alive except for some pigeons . You have to get rid of your distractions . The people I love are not distractions ! Then why can 't you fly ? You 've done it . Your body remembers how . The only thing standing in your way is you . What am I supposed to do ? Cut ' em out of my life ? - How cold do you expect me to be ? - Did you forget you 're a bomb ? You 've got to remember what this is about . Or , do you have to ask for your brother 's permission for that as well ? Anything else that I have to do ? You wanna make a list ? You 're a sad cartoon of a broken heart bleeding all over the place . I 'm just trying to get your mind straight . Look , I have followed you around and listened to your half-assed wisdom . You don 't have any answers ! Okay ? You don 't know anything . - You are afraid of the world . - You have to listen to me . And I am tired of you telling me what I have to do ! - I don 't have to do anything ! - Except fly . Son of a bitch . Not quite what I was expecting , but hope for the flowers yet . You threw me . Off of a 30-story building ! If I didn 't regenerate , I 'd be dead ! Well , you could have flown . Listen , if you hadn 't have worked this one out , you 'd have been hopeless anyway . And I 'd have to defuse the biggest bomb ever . But you did it , didn 't you ? You cleared your mind . You called out your power . You know , before I hit the ground ... when I knew what was about to happen , I had this flash ... in my head , of this girl that I met in Texas . This cheerleader . She could heal herself . Oh , gosh , she 's this sweet kid . Sad little smile , and she just ... You were wrong . I don 't have to cut her out . I have to remember her ! How ... how she made me feel ! That 's how I ... Oh , God . It 's happening . I 'm losing it ! Well , it 's a start . Peter ? Yes ? I think I found a way to stop him . - I found him . - Sylar ? - I thought you had Sylar . - I will again . Soon . You mean Petrelli . Where is he ? I think he 's been here this whole time . And I 've been painting him . Except no one can see him . Like he 's a ghost , or ... invisible . What does that mean ? It means an old friend isn 't quite as dead as we thought he was . Mom ? I know it 's not our game night , but can we play a game of Scrabble - since you just got home ? - Absolutely . I owe you , like , a dozen . - Just give me a minute , okay ? - Okay ! No ! What are you so mad about , Niki ? You 're the one who wanted to be locked up . No ... no . I 'm home ! In the kitchen . You are in big trouble , young lady . The school called . Did you think you could ditch , and I wouldn 't find out ? Mom , we talked about it this morning . Zach and I went to the aquarium . Claire , I think I would remember a conversation about you skipping ' school . - You okay ? - Fine , I ... banged my head on something . Bit of a headache . Why don 't you let me finish , uh , setting the table , and you can go lie down for a little bit . Don 't think this gets you off the hook . Hello ? You might not remember me . We haven 't spoken in a long time , but ... Our daughter just found me . Did you hear what I just said ? She 's alive . We need to talk , Nathan .

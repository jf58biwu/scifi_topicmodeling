 NARRATOR : Previously on Fringe : BROYLES : They 're calling these the Pattern , as if someone 's experimenting only the whole world is their lab . - Anybody you need , you can have . OLIVIA : His name 's Walter Bishop . - My father . - He worked out of Harvard . He was part of a classified U.S. Army experimental program in an area called fringe science . You 're saying I can talk to John in a coma ? You could access his memories . FLORA : Joseph . Joe . You 're gonna be late . Oh , look at yourself . Tuck in your shirt . Put a comb through your hair , for God 's sake . Dara 's son , he always takes care of his appearance . ( WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA ) RON : Meager . - It 's " Meegar . " Late again and making personal calls ? - No , no , I 'm ... - Who 's this ? - Nobody . - She your girlfriend ? JOSEPH : She came with the phone . - You stalking this girl ? No . ( ZAPS ) - Are you kidding me ? - Oh , come on . Unbelievable . Two in one week . Your sweep 's leaving , Meager . Get on it , or get another gig . ( MUSIC PLAYING OVER HEADPHONES ) Hi . How are you today ? And we 're still on for the regional managers ' meeting tomorrow at 4 ? Great . Yeah . Thank you . Okay , great . No problem . Okay , thank you . Bye-bye . Oh , I 'm so sor ... I did not mean to interrupt . No problem . Don 't you usually have a little tablet thingy with you ? Yeah . I usually do . Is there something else , or ... ? - I used to be a Webelo . - I don 't ... The Webelos , Cub Scouts ? Your Brownie patch . Oh , yeah . No , I actually found that online . It 's kitschy , right ? I was gonna put it on one of my jackets . Oh , that 's ... Oh , that 's ... Yeah , that 's cool . Hey , Bethany . We still on for drinks tonight ? Of course . But you better not keep me out too late this time . We 'll see . BETHANY : No , no , no . Please , don 't do this to me . Come on . No . What happened ? Damn it . Oh , my God . Do not crash on me . This is not happening . ( ELEVATOR DINGS ) Hold it . Hold it . Please , hold the elevator . I gotta find an IT guy . This is a disaster . Oh , you dropped your ... ( CRASHING ) - Are you okay ? - Get away from me . ( SCREAMING ) ( JOSEPH GROANS ) ( COUGHS ) Oh , no . Bethany ? Bethany ? ( CAR ENGINES START AND ALARMS WAILING ) Stop it . Stop it . Stop doing that ! Fringe s1e05 Power Hungry OLIVIA : Because you knew about John and you didn 't say anything , I trust you . At least , enough for me to not think you 're gonna think I 'm crazy . No , of course not . I saw him last night . You saw John ? OLIVIA : In my kitchen . Hello , Liv . OLIVIA : I grabbed my gun but he was gone . I know he wasn 't there , obviously . I just ... Let me see . You fall in love with your partner who betrays you and your country . He dies in your arms , shows up in your kitchen . And you wonder if that 's grounds to recuse yourself ? - Okay , we can start with that . - I say no . You exposed him . Bare minimum , that makes you indispensable . You want my advice ? Next time John shows up for a nightcap ... - ... give him one . - I 'm being serious . So am I. You think that a few weeks pass and everything you went through just goes away ? Don 't fight it . Don 't beat yourself up . You know , you 're good at that . That 's a character flaw . It 'll get easier . - She say what it was about ? PETER : Olivia ? - No , she 'll tell us when she gets here . - How are you ? - Never been better . - You look quite the opposite . Maybe that 's because I had trouble sleeping last night . Oh , I had trouble sleeping myself . I was thinking about that man . The one who tortured you . Something about him . So familiar . Peter , when I was in St. Claire 's ... We don 't have to talk . It 's not important . But it is important . You cannot imagine what it 's like for a man like me to not have access to parts of his mind . You 're doing fine , Walter . - Dr. Bishop . Peter . - Ahem . Visiting hours . Put on your best straitjacket . At approximately 10 : 17 this morning , a massive power surge struck a downtown high-rise in Worcester , Massachusetts . As a result , an elevator on the 26th floor plummeted straight to the basement . - Eight passengers died . - Did the cable snap ? That 's what 's strange . The elevator didn 't fall . It drove itself into the ground . - That 's not possible . BROYLES : Nine months ago a maglev train in Tokyo plowed through a crowded station . Publicly , reported as human error . In reality caused by a power surge of unknown origin . Intelligence chatter speculated it might be a demonstration of a new weapon technology . OLIVIA : It 's possible this morning 's event was another demonstration . To override the elevator 's circuitry would require a discharge of immense power and precision . I 've made arrangements for you at the building . We need to know what happened , how it happened , and who 's behind it . SIMMONS : Peter Simmons , the building 's engineer . Olivia Dunham , FBI . This is my team . Peter Bishop and Dr. Walter Bishop . So you 've been briefed on what 's happened ? Elevator powered itself into the floor . Never saw anything like it . - Shouldn 't the brakes have come on ? - They did . The safeties clamped into the rails , but for some reason , the motor kept going . Nearly melted the shoes , which is technically ... Impossible ? Yeah , we 've seen a lot of that lately . - You know your elevators . - MIT dropout . - Is there any security-camera footage ? - Nope , all the cameras fritzed . Hey , can you people move out of there ? FBI coming through . So how could an elevator drive itself ? It 's almost like another generator came online , jacked into the system and overloaded it with double or triple the voltage . WALTER : Exit-wound burns . Subconjunctival hemorrhages . This woman displays all the symptoms of a classic ... - Thermoelectric trauma . - What are you two saying ? He 's saying all these people were electrocuted . Electrocuted ? May I ? It 's lovely . Twenty-four-karat gold . Traces of nickel , possibly cobalt . - How are you doing that ? WALTER : This entire space is charged with electromagnetic energy , far beyond that which occurs in nature . And there 's still residual magnetic energy from whatever electrocuted these people . I need to examine the victims ' belongings and one of the bodies as well . - You may know how this happened ? - No , not yet . But I can tell you , every one of the passengers in this elevator dead by the time they hit the ground . WALTER : I have worked on a project where I 've seen this before . The government had asked me if it was possible to make the human being trackable by pigeons . Like homing pigeons ? What possible use could that serve ? Well , I 'm sure it had something to do with the commies . It always did back then . Regardless , our theory was that human beings are merely highly complex electrical systems . Battery , please , Olivia . And the heart , the brain driven by electrical impulses . Because everyone has a unique electromagnetic signature which is like a fingerprint we theorized that properly altered pigeons should be able to hone in to that signature . - Like they know to fly south for winter ? - Precisely . But the human field was too weak so we tried to augment it , make it strong enough for the birds to detect . - Did it work ? - Oh , yes . But the side effects negated our plans . There was one test subject , every time she hiccupped , the lights would dim . So you 're saying these people could control electronic devices ? No , not deliberately . But I did surmise that it could be possible . - Oh . - Did you just make that come back to life ? No . Not in this particular instance . - But it does confirm my theory . OLIVIA : What theory ? - Didn 't I say ? - No . Someone has pursued this idea . They have amplified a person 's electromagnetic field . In fact , it is the residual energy from that person that is making this heart pump . And further , it is that person who is responsible for the deaths in the elevator . So you don 't think it was a weapon that electrocuted those people ? No . It was a human being . MAN ( ON TV ) : ... accident occurred just after 10 am here at the Herndon Building ... - ... in downtown Worcester . - Hey , Ron wanted to see you . - Names haven 't yet been released , dropped 26 stories to their deaths when the building 's elevator system failed catastrophically . What 's wrong with you ? You look sick . Excuse me , Mr. Boynton . - Where have you been ? - Excuse me ? Do you remember last week ? What I said to you ? The words I used ? How sympathetic I was ? What did I say ? That you were watching my performance . I said to stay on the damn grid and stick to the schedule , because the system depends on people like you being , at the very least , reliable . I 've had a really hard day . Guess what ? Your day 's fantastic compared to mine . No , it 's not . - What 's on your uniform ? - What ? - What is that ? - I don 't know . I 'm not sure . I 'll tell you what , I 'll make it easy . It 's not your uniform anymore . - Go to the locker room . - Wait . - Take it off and leave it there . - No , please . - I take care of my mother . - And I take care of my family . One of the ways I do that is to employ smart , reliable , capable people . - You are none of those things . - Please . You 're fired . Go . - Mr. Boynton ... - Get out . I don 't wanna see you in this building anymore . Get the hell out of here ! ( SCREAMING ) Oh , no . MAN : Get him out of there . ( CHATTERING ALARM WAILING ) BROYLES : Here . Thanks . - I thought you left hours ago . - I could say the same about you . What are you reading ? New Distortion in Human Subjects . And what 's all this for ? I was trying to wrap my head around an idea Walter had . He believes that it may be a person who is responsible for the Herndon incident . Not a person wielding some kind of device . A person who has developed the ability to affect or maybe even control electrical devices . I suppose the good doctor has a theory how that 's possible ? He thinks this person was altered in some way . Extensive procedures , chemical therapy . What ? In the course of investigating other Pattern cases we 've come across a handful of clinics . Off-the-grid operations that solicited clients by making the same kind of claims you see advertised on TV at 3 a.m. Only they weren 't actually providing weight loss or hair growth . What were they really doing ? Have you ever heard of a man named Jacob Fischer ? - No . - A doctor of biotechnology wanted in four states and three countries for illegal human experimentation . Surgical alterations , radical hormone therapy using average citizens as unwitting guinea pigs . One subject was pumped full of stimulants . Kept awake for a solid year . Fed on a steady visual diet of horrific images . I only bring it up because if Dr. Bishop is right and there is a person with these extraordinary capabilities it might very well be that someone made him this way . I 'd like to read the files on Dr. Fischer . I 'll have them transferred to your terminal . But it 's not easy stuff to look at . ( CLATTERING ) Hello ? ( ELEVATOR DINGS ) Hey , Liv . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's just me . I know this doesn 't make any sense to you . Even if it did , you don 't have any reason to trust me , but I 'm asking you to . We don 't have much time . - I 'm here to help . - You tried to kill me . No . Liv I loved you . You know that . You know I loved you . I did . Always . I can prove it to you . But not here . It 's just not the way it works . You 're on the right track . I 'm here to tell you that . You 're looking for a person , but Jacob Fischer is after him also . You need to get to him first , before Fischer can use him . Use him for what ? Use him for what ? How do you know that ? I will prove it , Liv that I love you . Always . But not just yet . You 're just gonna have to wait . OLIVIA : There were weight sensors in the elevator . So just before impact the car weighed 1440 pounds . The combined weight of the victims : 1275 pounds . Leaving a discrepancy of a hundred and 65 pounds . Meaning someone walked out of there alive . Okay . So somebody got lucky . So what ? Walter 's theoretical test subject , I think , is real . - And this could be him . - The problem with that scenario is that it doesn 't make sense . If he was in the elevator car he should 've been electrocuted like everyone else . - That 's if the impact didn 't kill him first . - Not necessarily . If this person is both the source and the conductor of a large amount of electrical current , then it could induce a form of electrodynamic levitation . That 's the technology behind maglev trains . They essentially float on an electromagnetic cushion . So he floated ? Like my necklace in the elevator ? No , but it is possible that he could have levitated long enough to escape the brunt of the impact . That still doesn 't make sense . If you can sabotage machines , you wouldn 't sabotage one you 're in . PETER : Unless it was unintentional . An accident . Maybe whoever we 're looking for isn 't in control of their abilities . They don 't even know what they 're doing . We shouldn 't look for big events . We should look for small ones . Unintentional ones . ( ZAPS ) Oh , come on . Damn it . Just a small discharge negligible compared to the voltage coursing through that elevator . I say , we need to find this person , and soon before he finds out exactly what he 's capable of . Wool socks . OLIVIA : Charlie , thanks for waking up the team . Look , we got reports of anomalies clustered around parts of Worcester and the Herndon building . Parking-garage gates , automatic doors , a few CCTVs . We need more . Enough to discern a pattern . You know , saying somebody is doing all this , you do know that 's crazy , right ? If it weren 't , we wouldn 't be looking for him . - Joseph . - Mom . What time is it ? - Where the hell have you been ? - Mom ... - ... I think I made a big mistake . - You ? Surprise . Please , just listen to me . Please . A few months ago , I was reading this magazine , and there was this ad in the back about tapping into your hidden potential and I figured it couldn 't hurt , so I went down to this office . - They did some tests . - Did you give them money ? - What the hell 's the matter with you ? - They put me under some hypnosis I don 't know , and they said they were gonna realign the electrical impulses of my brain . - Make it mimic a more confident person . - Oh ! No , but they did something to me . They changed me . I can 't remember . Now all these things have been happening . I don 't know what to do . I don 't know what to do . - What if I 'm dying ? - Stop it ! Get ahold of your ... Damn it , Mom ! For once , please , please , help me . ( FLORA GRUNTS AND GASPS ) - Pills . - Oh , my God . No , no , no . Please . FLORA : Pills . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Joseph Meegar ? You don 't have to be scared , Joseph . We want to help you . - We 're here to adjust your medication . - You did this to me . What did you ... Ahh ! Looking for anything unusual . Systems going off-line ... - ... random power surges . - Hey , I 've got another incident . - Hold on . - Bicoastal Parcel . Guy lost his hand ... - ... in a conveyor malfunction . - Bicoastal Parcel ? RODRIGUEZ : Yeah . I gotta call you back . What ? Herndon Building security sign-in sheet . " Bicoastal Parcel . " " Joseph Meegar . " She was found dead . Pacemaker malfunction . Olivia thinks they may have found our guy . Now we just have to find him . Time of death was around 1 : 15 a.m. So God knows where he could be by now . Ask her what 's visible in the event perimeter electronic , specifically . Walter wants to know what 's in the apartment . What kind of gadgets ? - Specifically , electronics . - Um ... - Okay , there 's a answering machine . - An answering machine . - Telephone . Boom box . - Telephone . Boom box . - Fan . - Fan . Boom box . That 's a device for playing music , cassette tapes , yes ? Yes , but now 's not really the time ... - Anything else ? - Television . - A television . - Lamps . A lamp . Walter . Walter . Pay attention . We 're doing this for you . Tell Olivia to come home . I know how to find him . So , what is this ? ( MUSIC PLAYING ) This is the sort of work I was born for . You were hoping for something more specific ? Everyone has a unique magnetic fingerprint . I said that , yes ? But it 's limited , barely traceable except in people like Mr ... - What was his name ? - Meegar . Meegar . But since Mr. Meegar has been enhanced he 'll give off a stronger signal than your average Joe . What 's that got to do with the cassette tape ? Cassette tape is as simple as it gets . Once exposed to a magnetic field it remains permanently magnetized . Given the strength of Mr. Meegar 's electromagnetic signature plus his proximity to the tape I have little doubt that that cassette has been imprinted with Meegar 's electrical signature . It 's kind of like when a film camera double exposes a picture . Let me just take out the music and see what we have left . ( CHUCKLES ) Look , look , look . There it is . That 's him . That 's Mr ... ALL : Meegar . Yes . Now to find Meegar . - How ? - Birds . - Wait , you mean that pigeon thing ? - Mm-hm . OLIVIA : You believe we can find him using pigeons ? I think it 's possible . As I 've said , I can program carrier pigeons to track a strong electromagnetic field . We have his signature . - Now all we need are birds . - I wish you told me earlier because then I could have been working on it . - So how many ? - Not many . Two dozen . Two dozen ? Great . ( DOOR OPENS ) - Wait , where am I ? - Tell Fischer he woke up . What is this place ? What are you doing ? What are you ... ? No , no , no . Wait , wait . No , no . Please , please , please . PETER : You ready ? WALTER : Yes , ideal . You 're not gonna accidentally fry one of those pigeons ? Stranger things have happened . - It 's his motto . - As I said pigeons contain traces of magnetite in their beaks like hundreds of tiny compass needles . The tesla coils will create an artificial electromagnetic field which I have already matched with Mr. Whatever 's unique signature and we 'll now imprint onto the pigeon . So we set all of these birds free , and they ... ? Fly to Joseph Meegar . Me too . I 'll believe it when I see it . Step back . Work to be done . - GPS chips ready ? ASTRID : Yep . So we 're putting GPS chips on carrier pigeons to find a man who can control electricity ? I have you to thank for that , don 't I ? Yeah . That 's me . JOHN : Liv . No . - You listened . - You 're not real . - The last time we spoke , you listened . - You stay the hell away from me . Liv . I didn 't betray you . You know that . In your heart . You know I wasn 't the one . Hey . I think this bird thing might actually work . You okay ? Yeah . PETER : Hey , Charlie . OLIVIA : Oh , thanks . - Did I miss anything ? - I think the show 's about to start . I know we 've only been together for a short time but I think I 'm going to miss them . Such majestic creatures . They 're rats with wings . You 'll get over it . All right . GPS is active . Excellent . Then we 're ready . Ladies and gentlemen , start your engines . CHARLIE : Start it up , Adam . WALTER : Come on , come on . ( WHISTLES ) ( LAUGHS ) Are you sure this is gonna work ? Of course not . PETER : Seriously , if this works ... You 're gonna have some more faith in your father ? No . - So , what do we do now ? - We gotta tie the GPS to the mainframe . Ingenious . And we 're in . And there are the birds . - I don 't see them . - Yeah , we lost the birds . They 're going northwest towards Mill Street . PETER : We 're approaching Mill now . - Make a left . Take a left . I see them . PETER : All right , we got them . I see them . Aren 't you glad you got the car washed ? ( SCREAMS ) - What is that ? - It is unfair . And I appreciate that . The position you find yourself in now must be so surreal for you . Oh , my God , what did you do to me ? My head hurts so much . Those had to be subdermal . They can be removed later . What am I doing here ? No , no , no . You don 't realize what you are . I 'm scared . - Okay ? - You wanted to be confident . That 's why you came to us . No , I don 't want to be confident . I don 't need to be confident . - But you are now . - I just want my life back ! I just want to go back to how it was , please . Look what science has made you , Joseph . - You are special . - No . - Make a right on Tempest . - Take your next right . All right , I think they 've stopped . - There . - All right , I got them . I see them . Okay , we 're heading there now . Then our work is done . Good luck . Hey . You stay here . Whatever you say , boss . - I 'm not gonna ask . - Good . - What is it ? - Visitors , front entrance . Take him out through the back . Wait at the depot . You 'll be contacted . - What about you ? - He 's the priority . No movement . Stand back . Where are you taking me ? Get in . Get in the car . AGENT : Get those hands up . I said get your hands in the air . Joseph Meegar . Where is he ? I 'm sorry , who ? Take upstairs . We 'll go around . ( GROANS ) Freeze ! Stop ! Joseph ! ( HORN BLOWS ) ( MACHINES POWERING UP ) Stop ! They 're gonna keep him heavily sedated a while . Don 't want him pulling his whole electro-man thing . Mr. Meegar ? Miss , no one will tell me where I 'm going . To the hospital . They 're going to perform some exams . Check to see that your head 's okay . Then I 'm gonna have some questions for you . I wanna go home . I didn 't wanna hurt anybody . - We 're going to help you . - That 's what they said . Please . I wanna go home . I 'm afraid we can 't let you do that . That one can go out the back , thank you , my dear . What 's my name ? Starts with A , yes ? - Astrid . - Yeah . I knew it . Ah , Olivia . Peter told me to tell you , if I saw you ... - ... that he was returning the pigeons . - Walter . What 's ... ? It 's milk . From Gene . - Do you want some ? OLIVIA : I 'll pass . - Are you certain ? - Mm-hm . The color in your face , you 're looking a little pallid . Are you feeling well ? Fine . I 'm a little tired , that 's all . Well , I don 't yet know you well enough to ask this but you haven 't seemed yourself lately . I haven 't been sleeping very well . I 've been ... Nothing . I 'll see you tomorrow . Have you been seeing him ? Your friend , John Scott . I 'm not surprised . There is a reason . I 've been having hallucinations . No . Not hallucinations . Walter ? - What 's happening ? - I can 't be sure . The brain is a mystery . But I believe when you were in the tank John Scott ... Part of his consciousness crossed over into yours . And it 's still there . His memories experiences , thoughts . You understand me , yes ? These aren 't memories . He appears . Right in front of me . He talks to me . Yes , he would . Like a waking dream . Because he doesn 't belong there . There 's only room for one voice in your head , not two . This is your brain 's way of working it out . Your mind is expelling him . Exorcising his thoughts . He 'll go away . Is that what you 're saying ? I don 't know . Do you really want him to ? ( GUNSHOT ) BROYLES : Our team is still cataloging all the files you found in the cellar . Apparently , John Scott was conducting his own investigations . Do the files give any indication of who he might have been working for ? Not that we can see . But it appears many of the cases were Pattern-related . He knew about the Pattern ? He also knew about our friend Dr. Fischer . In fact , he knew quite a bit more than we did . Including seven other potential Josephs that Fischer was subjecting to treatments . Fortunately , none of them had activated yet . We were able to locate all seven . Medical services is examining them now . But they appear to be fine , thanks to you . Fischer 's still refusing to cooperate , but six weeks in solitary ... - ... might change his mind . - I hope you 're right about that . And there was also something else . John Scott 's personal effects . It would seem some of them were intended for you . JOHN : I will prove it , Liv . That I love you . Always .

BUT NONE OF IT 'S REAL . YOU ARE . I AM . THE FEELINGS WE HAVE FOR EACH OTHER ARE AS REAL AS ANYTHING WE 'VE EVER EXPERIENCED . IS THAT WHY THEY DID THIS ? KEPT US HERE FOR EIGHT YEARS ? BECAUSE THEY WANTED US TO FALL IN LOVE ? MOMENTS . THAT 'S ALL THAT 'S PASSED , BUT IN THOSE FEW SECONDS , WE 'VE ACCUMULATED YEARS OF MEMORIES THAT WILL BOND US IN THE REAL WORLD . I THOUGHT THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT SAVING THE WORLD , NOT PLAYING MATCHMAKER . THEY 'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU . YOUR LIFE IS ABOUT TO PLUNGE INTO CRISIS . YOUR MISSION WILL BE THREATENED . THEY CAN 'T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN . THEY GAVE YOU THIS RELATIONSHIP AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH , TO SUSTAIN YOU IN THE TRIALS THAT LAY AHEAD . WHAT CRISIS ? WHAT- - WHAT IS IT ?

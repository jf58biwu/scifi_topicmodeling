Absolutely . - What does ? - A consultant do exactly ? Well , it 's complicated . Mostly I meet with various business and government people They explain their all strangedy and tractive Need your help . Must warn target . - Rebel and consult . Honey , do you have to do that at the table ? Sorry . No . Can 't . So I have yet to hear word one about your trip . Claire ? Nothing much to tell . You visited five Of the best colleges on the east coast And you have nothing to tell ? Which ones did you like , Noah ? Brown . I liked brown . Claire ? Come back here . I think all this I believe to talk might be a little intimidating . Maybe community college would be a better fit for now . I 'll go talk to her . What the hell was that ? I can 't lie to her anymore . Your new job ! Our father / daughter college tour . We can 't risk her knowing anything right now . The last time she knew , she almost got herself killed . Your mom and lyle are safer this way . Dad , you 've been telling me that since I was 15 . They 're not just watching you , Claire . They 're watching me . You brought a plane down out of the sky , federal agents are dead , and a lot of people want to see you pay . If either one of us strays from the script , I won 't be able to stop them . There won 't be any paper trail . No trial . One day , you 'll just be gone And nobody can find you . And now 's the part where you tell me how everything you do , you do to protect me . No . Now 's the part when I tell you exactly what you 're going to do next . Start classes at costa verde community . You 're already enrolled . History , English Lit , Spanish . And come monday morning , You better be parked in that front row With a sharp number two pencil Or there is going to be hell to pay . Warn Alex . Sam 's comics . On Buford . Go now . - Rebel . Wires are up . Accounts are frozen . We have traffic cam feeds from all 50 states . Patriot act gives us a lot of leeway here . What 's our status on the Bennet girl ? Eyes only . We look , but we don 't touch . Senator Petrelli has granted Ms. Bennet a probation for now . Should the terms of that arrangement be compromised , I will certainly bring it to his attention . Assuming he finishes his latte and decides to show up for work . Double espresso . And Claire Bennet is still off-limits . Now I know a lot of you lost friends on this crash . You want payback . I understand that . Not all of these individuals out there are dangerous . Some of them are just plain scared . Now that they know they 're being pursued , They 're gonna be even that much harder to catch . Which is why I put in a request to the white house this morning to double our funding . We need to show progress . These are our targets . Know them , hunt them , Track them , and bring them home alive . This is so cool . Road trip . My mom never took me anywhere . Ooh , we should stop at some skanky dinner somewhere And get some pie And some milkshakes . We 're not stopping . Sure ? It 's a long way till we get to your dad . Where is he ? I told you , " just keep heading west . " Yeah , you told me to keep heading west . Now I want to know exactly where he is . Okay , uh , he told me that if he ever had to disappear , I could find him in minnesota . He 's got a cabin in the woods About 28 miles west of- - You 're lying . It 's amazing how you can do that . Tell me where he is . Okay , okay . He has an ex-wife who 's a flight attendant . She lives in Des Moines . They had a kid that was born with some sort of ... Bone dis- - Stop . I can tell when people are lying Because I saw open their skulls and rip their abilities out from their brains . So you 're like a serial killer . I 'm not a serial killer . But you 've got a pattern . You go after specific victims . You collect mementos . Okay , technically , I 'm a serial killer . Now that we 've established that , give me one good reason Why I shouldn 't tear open your head right here . Because you 'll never find your dad . It 's not a road trip . Do you understand ? Sir ! Are you Alex ? You 're a girl . Yeah , I am . No , it 's just we don 't normally get a lot of girls in here . You know ? Listen , I 'm just here to deliver a message . You 're in danger . You need to get out of here immediately . Victor . What ? oh , come on . A hot blonde in a comic book store ? Please . Victor sent you , right ? This is payback for the whole birthday thing , right ? Wait , let me guess . Is this all gonna end with you giving me Like a lap dance or something ? You have to listen to me , all right ? This is not a joke . There are people out there who are after you . They will come in here and take you away . Yeah ! in here ? Oh , come on . You gotta do a better job convincing me . Your life Is in danger . Move , now You wanna tell me what the hell is going on ? There 's a man in here . He 's looking for you , And he 's very , very dangerous . Do you have your car here ? Yeah , yeah , but it 's out back . Alex working today ? Come on . Alex woolsley . I 'm from the county clerk 's office . Afraid we have a situation With some outstanding parking violations . Um , would you rather just go talk outside ? Sorry . Uh , this isn 't a really good time. is it important ? Look , dad , I just- - I was thinking about what happened this morning ... Uh , sweetheart , I 'm gonna have to call you back . Go ! We 're gonna need a team down here . Come on. come on. come on . Come on . Hello , destiny This is it , Ando The same towers , the same wedding canopy ... The exact spot from Matt Parkman 's drawing . Now all I need to do is save the bride , and stop the wedding This is crazy . If there is one thing I 've learned It 's that when destiny calls , You answer the phone I 'm going to check what time the wedding starts . So I won 't be late to stop it . Stop a wedding ... makes no sense . Hello . Hi. my name is Ando . I 'm sorry . I 'm Annapura . Annapura . Your name is familiar . Are you a guest of the groom ? No , not exactly . Are you okay ? Just a little sad. that 's all . On your wedding day ? But this is supposed To be the happiest day of your life , isn 't it ? Yes , that 's what they say . Then you must call off the wedding . This is incredible . I 've been feeling so lost and confused . I 've asked the heavens for a sign Telling me whether I should marry or not . A sign . Uh , yes , a sign . Ando ? What are you doing ? ! You are the sign ! You 're the one I 've been waiting for . Sign. no , no , no , no . It 's not him. it 's me . I 'm the sign . That 's it . The wedding is off . Do we have any response from The white house ? nothing yet . So these are the bad guys . Abby collins. homeland security . Nathan petrelli. nice to meet you . The white house has transferred Oversight of your operations to DHS . I 'm here to kick the tires And find out what it is we bought . Just what we need . Another bureaucrat . Can I give you a tour ? I don 't know how fully briefed you are On what 's happened here for the last few days . I made it clear that eagle rock prison is Woefully inadequate for our needs . The reason I 've asked for such a large funding increase Is to reinforce the facility So I can deal with these prisoners . Right , because they 're all magic . You don 't believe any of this , do you ? Who put you on this assignment exactly ? People close to the president Are concerned about his exposure on this . Time travelers , mind readers . We are dealing with a threat the likes of which This country has never seen before . We need better containment . I can barely handle the one detainee I ... Are you telling me that you 're keeping a prisoner here ? Without warrant or miranda rights ? I 'm gonna need to speak with the president directly . Yeah , well , that 's not gonna happen . I 'm your new boss , And I want to see your prisoner now . This is what I 'm talking about . Place like this , Worse food , the better . Luke . You really got to stop trying to be my friend , Or I 'm gonna have to kill you . Do you like birds ? What ? Well , now , I 'm just wondering if it 's genetic . I mean , your dad , he 's way into birding . I went with him sometimes . He 'd come get me up about 4 : 00 a.m. And we 'd be out walking a trail by dawn . We 'd see goldfinch and cormorants , woodcocks . He 'd always be pulling this old , rusty wagon Behind him , carrying all his bird books . Red wagon ? Yeah , it had these--it had these big , big rubber wheels . He used to pull me in that wagon . I remember laying in a red wagon ... All wrapped up in blankets . It was still dark And the silhouettes of the tree branches ... I remember thinking they looked like ... Snake fingers . He sold you for money , you know . Told me once he had a little boy A long time ago , but he needed cash , So he sold him . What kind of man sells his own son ? Why would he even tell you something like that ? Maybe I reminded him of you . Oh , my god . I know. it looks harsh . We tried insulated gloves , But she shattered right through them . The constant heat is to ensure ... abby . This is tracy strauss . You know her . She used to lobby for a defense contractor . Abby , they won 't let me out of here . You have to do something . What is this insanity ? This woman is extremely dangerous . Abby , he 's lying. you know me . This woman is tracy strauss , And you have her shackled to a chair . That 's why we need better funding . Funding ? I am shutting this operation down today , And then I 'm going to the a.g. ' s office And I 'm filing human rights violations Against you , senator . This is torture. you 're through . Abby . Abby ! I can 't believe it . They 're just locking people up ? Believe it. it 's happening . Somebody sent me to warn you . You must be on a list Or something . A list ? why is he after me ? Do you have a power ? Like a special ability or something ? I can breathe underwater . You mean like- - Like a fish. yeah . I was on the swim team in high school . One day , I noticed I just didn 't have To come up for air anymore . Never told anyone . I didn 't know there were others . You think I 'd be proud of it or something , but ... Instead , I just ... Feel like a ... Like a freak ? Look , don 't go home . Don 't use your credit cards or your cell phone . If he can find you at work , he can find you anywhere . What am I gonna do ? I don 't know. we 'll figure something out . What ? That car that drove past . Second time it went by . Is this car registered under your name ? Get out . Car 's still warm . Believe me now ? Let 's go . The house specialties- - So this is your place ? With shyla . Yes . We open two years ago . Against my grandfather 's wishes . Your grandfather ? He believes in tradition . Thinks women should be at home Raising the children . That 's why he arranged my marriage to deepak . But you don 't love deepak . He is a powerful and dangerous man . Above the law . My grandfather was too frightened to deny His request to marry . You must be hungry , my hero . Let me bring you more . what`s the matter with you ? We came all this way . and you stole my chance to get my power back I only stopped the wedding , like the drawing said . The drawing wanter me to stop the wedding Hiro , I have a power now .

Yeah , I saw that . She mentioned she had some errands to run . It 's a small town . We 'll talk . At least tell me how long this is gonna last . Are we driving for another hour ? Another week ? Hey , check out zz topp . Oh ! Ah , god ! Stop it . What ? I 'm just messing with him . Not here . We don 't need the attention . Our powers are not For amusement , luke , you understand that ? I mean , I don 't know . I 've never really talked to anyone about it before . My mom thinks I 'm enough of a freak as is . So what , you only use your powers for a reason ? Usually . Sometimes I disappoint myself . Always have an objective . Know your end game before you lift a hand . What else ? Keep a clear head . Emotions make you sloppy . The most important thing Is that you understand your motivation . Always know what it is that you want . What is it that you want ? For me , um ... It 's mostly been about acquiring abilities , But lately ... Lately , all I want to find is my father . I want to meet the man who made me . Look him in the eyes . What are you hoping to see in there ? Where I came from , I guess . Why I turned out the way I did . I 'm just thinking he 'll have some answers . That 's all . This is the address . it 's a two-day drive . You shouldn 't have done that . Now there 's nothing to keep me from killing you , is there ? Well , I guess I 'm just hoping that you won 't .

She 's being forced into this Against her will . You are making a mistake . You have kidnapped my friend . I want him back . He 's being held hostage . It is not I who broke our agreement . She does not want to marry you . All my life , I 've tried to please you , grandfather . But if I marry deepak , I will be giving up everything That matters most to me . Perhaps a traditional marriage is not my destiny . We had a deal . The woman and the bakery belong to me . You leave her alone . Give me back my friend . That 's it. the wedding is off . You 're too much trouble . I don 't want to marry you . And you can have your lousy friend back . This is it . The moment in the drawing . This is me being the hero . So how was your day ? Dad . Wanna tell me what the hell you 're doing here ? I was just applying for a job At the coffee house . Stop it , claire . What ? they posted a " help wanted " online . I know you 're lying . Well , I did learn from the master . You think you 're invincible , but you 're not . Just because you can 't be injured Doesn 't mean you can 't be caught . Do you have any idea what happens If they think I can 't control you anymore ? That 's the thing , dad . You can 't . Reports are in from the diner . They brought down the kid , luke campbell . Sylar ? Dhs is trying to take us down , And all we have is a 17-year-old boy . From the office of the secretary . You are hereby notified To cease and desist this operation In its entirety . Abby , don 't do this . Give me five minutes . Let me change your mind . Just suspend your disbelief for a second And imagine that these people exist , People who possess powers . It still wouldn 't justify torture . I 'm talking about people who can slice your head open With their finger ... Make you think what they want you to think , Get inside your head . This is your argument . That these people are so dangerous That they have no constitutional rights ? There 's no justification for treating people this way . And american citizens , no less . You can 't pull the plug on a war When you haven 't even been to the front lines . People shouting ] 'scuse me . Tracy . Aaah ! Fire ! Ah ! I 'm really sorry you had to witness that today . I know how upsetting that must have been . It 's definitely something I won 't soon forget . I wouldn 't be doing any of this Unless I believed in the bottom of my heart These people are just too dangerous to be among us . Don 't worry . You 'll have all the funding you need . Don 't fill up . Your dad 's bringing home takeout From that new indian place . Sounds good . I didn 't mean to pry this morning . Sounds like your trip was a little--I don 't know what . Disappointing ? Did you guys have any fun at all ? Take in a broadway show ? Dad was a little busy ... Abducting innocent people . He 's not been honest with you , mom . He 's not a consultant . He 's working for a secret program Imprisoning people with powers . The company ? No . No , the company 's gone . This is something else . Honey , are you sure ? - I mean , maybe - I was there . I saw it . They were loading prisoners onto a transport plane . They had them all hooded . They were drugged . It was horrible . Oh , my god . It 's starting all over again . No , this is worse . They 're taking everyone . Not just dangerous people . Anyone with an ability . Matt parkman . Dr. suresh . Peter . I 'm sorry . I just can 't lie to you anymore . Indian food ? Go on upstairs , honey . what 's going on ? Noah , I can 't take it anymore . I just can 't . What are you talking about ? I know what you 're doing . Hunting people down . You don 't know what I 've been doing . Don 't lie to me , noah . You have no idea ... I really wanted to believe ... - How big this thing is . - that you could change . That you could be someone different From who you really are . Do you have any idea how difficult this is ? Maybe I don 't have a choice ! there is always a choice ! The government is putting together a list Of people they are rounding up , And they have made it very clear to me That if I am not on board , that claire will be on that list . don 't make this about claire ! Tracy , I don 't know how you did it , But you better get used to the heat Because you are never getting out of here again . We both know what you did . What are you talking about ? Broken chain , unlocked door . You wanted me to escape . You know what ? Next time , I will . Something 's wrong . Team leader , This is central , please respond . Team leader , this is central . Please respond . Team leader , this is central. do you copy ? Repeat , do you copy ? This is central command. go to channel b . Please respond. do you copy ? Team leader , this is central . You were right . I should have never interrupted the course of destiny . No apolpgoes , my friend . I realize why I was sent to India and it wasn 't to get my abilities back . It was to learn that I do not need powers to be a hero . I finally figured out why your names are so familiar . A fax came in addressed to hiro and ando . See ? It 's from someone named rebel . Who ? Just an address in los angeles . And the words , " save matt parkman . " It 's a message from destiny . So you straightened it all out with mom , And now you 're off to a new assignment ? No . No , your mother wants me To move out of the house for a while . She 's right . We keep too many secrets in this family . So I 'm gonna try to be a better person . Better husband , better father . And not tell lies . And if we all work really hard To be honest with each other , Then maybe we can ... Heal these wounds . But I 'll be around . We 'll get through this . I love you , claire bear . I 'll see ya . Thanks for coming back for me . I didn 't come back for you . I came back for this . You just happened to be there . Tracked me twice in less than a week . I knew if I kept driving , it was only a matter of time Before they caught up to me again . I needed to understand how they work . Still , you could have just left me . Mark Leggett . Excuse me ? The analyst who died in the hall today . That was his name . Mark Leggett . Thought you 'd want to know . He left a wife and two kids . You let her out , didn 't you ? You murdered an innocent man . There are times in war When someone has to fall on a grenade . He didn 't fall. you threw him . I saved your ass . This entire project was about to be flushed , And I helped us both out , petrelli . It needed to be done . I 'm sorry that a man had to die . Why don 't you go apologize to his blood stain ? It 's still warm . Staying here at the hotel ? Just for a little while . I 'm actually looking for an apartment In town if you know of anything . Mm-mm . Welcome to costa verde . Well , it looks like our friend here Had about three too many . Don 't worry. we 'll get him home safe . To be continued

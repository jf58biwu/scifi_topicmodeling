 Previously on Heroes . Help us take down Building 26 . Danko 's men are killers . Just let it go , guys . I 'm not going with you , Peter . Maybe you 're ready to move on , but I 'm not . I 'm not ready to forgive myself . Not yet . Thank God ! Hi . There 's a van down the street filled with agents . I can hold them off for now , but I got to get the two of you guys out of here . I can 't go with you . Why not ? I have to go back , I have to face them , and I have to end this , or we cannot have a life together . Wait . Can you do it without leaving ... Who are you ? I can be anything I want . When the President agrees to meet with me , when he agrees to shake my hand , real change will come to this country . How is he doing this ? He 's a shape-shifter . And now he 's one handshake away from being the most powerful man on Earth . I just have to make sure that he doesn 't meet the President first . I 'll go with you . I started this , Pete . I gotta end it . There are nearly seven billion people on this planet . Each one unique , different . What are the chances of that ? And why ? Is it simply biology , physiology that determines this diversity ? A collection of thoughts , memories , experiences that carve out our own special place ? Or is it something more than this ? Perhaps there 's a master plan that drives the randomness of creation . Something unknowable that dwells in the soul and presents each one of us with a unique set of challenges that will help us discover who we really are . You okay ? Did you have a dream ? It 's Nathan . What about him ? He 's ... He 's what ? In trouble . He 's not the only one . What is it , Noah ? That construction work we passed about a mile back wasn 't real . There 's gonna be a road block half a mile or so ahead . This is where you get out . Okay . Head two miles in that direction , and then follow the surface streets into the city . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna buy you some time . Here . It 's a secure line . I will find you . Get to Nathan and make sure it is him . He 'll be on Sylar 's trail by now . But , Dad ... Listen to your father . I love you , Claire-bear . Is there a problem , Officer ? What are you doing ? I told you . I need you to be Taub . I 'm not interested in what you need anymore . Such a waste . You could 've been so helpful . Just didn 't know your place . Agent Gordon , send that cleanup crew ... That hurt . Shape-shifting . Gotta love it , right ? The changes don 't just happen on the outside , either . You remember that little off switch in the back of my head ? I moved it . Go ahead , get it over with . My men will be here any second to collect Petrelli . I know . I 've got plans for them . Hell , I have plans for all of us . You gonna kill him ? Later . Right after I absorb all of his memories . It 's a little ability Angela Petrelli fed me like a snack . Because Nathan , and by Nathan , I mean I have a rendezvous with destiny tomorrow . President 's giving a speech at the Stanton Hotel . Senator Petrelli 's going to be there to have a little meeting with him right afterwards . What for ? Nothing . Just to shake his hand . Then when I do , I 'm gonna be the most powerful man in the world . Then you better kill me now , because there 's no way I 'm gonna let that happen . No , I don 't need to kill you . Because in 30 seconds , there 's not a person on this planet who 'll believe a word you say . Man down ! Man down ! I got him . He 's in here . You son of a bitch . You think there 's a chance he didn 't get caught ? Noah ? No . That was his plan all along . I don 't know how my dad always manages to get himself in the middle of everything . Because he puts himself there , mostly because of you . You have no idea the lengths a parent will go to ensure the safety of their child . Something I hope you never have to find out for yourself . Now , this is where I get off . What do you mean ? I just wanted to make sure you got here safely . I 'm not going in there with you to see Nathan . Why not ? Because I need to go find Matt Parkman . Is this about your dream ? In it , Parkman saves Nathan 's life . Okay , so why don 't you just come up and warn Nathan , and tell him how to avoid danger ? That 's not how it works . I cannot change what I dreamed . But I can help push its outcome . Now , you go find Nathan , and I will find you later . Nathan . Wake up . Hey , wake up . We want to be convincing when we meet the President today , right ? I 'm gonna need all those sick little twisted memories of yours . Such a lightweight . To hell with it . I 've got plenty of memories from all this stuff you 've got lying around here , anyway . Your diploma says you graduated with honors from Annapolis . These cufflinks tell me a different story . Politicians . Sir . Someone here to see you . She claims to be your daughter . Oh , right . Send her in . Claire . I 'm glad you finally made it . I was beginning to get worried about you . Did you find him ? Sylar ? Yeah . But he got away . He 's going to the Stanton Hotel to meet the President in an hour . I 'm going to intercept the President first and warn him . And tell him what ? That Nathan Petrelli has a look-alike ? If I have to , yeah . Blow the lid off this whole thing . I 'm gonna do whatever it takes to shut down Building 26 . And how do I know this is you ? What are you talking about ? How do I know you 're not Sylar ? Claire . I 'm me . We 've spent a lot of time together over the past few days . Mexico . I was beginning to think you knew me better than anyone else . Sorry . That 's all right . Listen , why don 't you stay here ? I 've got a car taking me to the Stanton Hotel . Lay low until I can clean this whole mess up . No , I wanna come with you . In case anything goes wrong . It 's not going to be safe . So what ? I can 't get hurt . And I need to help stop Sylar . It 's time I put myself in the middle of this and made a difference . I was thinking exactly the same thing . You 're right . If things do go south , I want you right there . Right by my side . I got him . - Come on . - Let 's go . All right , bring him this way . Fancy meeting you here . I 'll bet you 're happy to see me . Sylar . We gotta stop him . Whoa ! Lot of help you 're going to be . Okay , let 's hear it . The lecture , the finger wagging , the general " I told you so . " I screwed up . Refused to listen . And then you got into bed with Sylar . That 's all over now . Clearly . That 's very Zen of you . No , it 's practical . If we get out of here , we 're going to have to throw everybody and everything we have at Sylar , try to get a spike into the back of his head . Spike 's not going to cut it anymore . He moved the spot . Great . How the hell did you do it ? Deal with all of this . You can 't capture all of them , can 't contain them . There are no rules . Not even gravity . It 's all about spinning plates . Living in the gray area . So many years of middle management , it becomes second nature . So in 20 years , I 'll get it ? Twenty years and an adopted daughter . If I didn 't have Claire , I 'd be following the same dogma that took you right over the edge . I 'd be exactly in your position . You are exactly in my position . Yeah . We should do something about that . Together ? Hiro . Hmm ? Holy crap . Hiro . Hiro . Is this a trick ? I don 't know . No guards . Something 's very wrong here . Hiro . Let 's go . Hiro , what happened ? We are rescuing you . I 'll try to repay you later . But right now we have to get out of here as soon as we can . Are you okay ? No , he 's not . He has nosebleeds and headaches from stopping time . I 'm fine . You 're a doctor , right ? You can help him . Here . Open your eyes wide . Your pupils are dilated . Do you have any stiffness in your left arm , or dizziness ? Yes . But Bruce Wayne only slept two hours a night . Hiro . Hiro . These abilities allow us to do superhuman things , but you are still human . And your human body is rejecting these powers , like a virus . But this power , it is what makes me strong . My destiny . You can 't freeze time again . Do you understand ? Thanks . So , what 's the plan ? We just tell them the President 's in danger ? That 'll just send him down a rabbit hole . Then Sylar can become a rabbit . Just gotta play it close to the vest . Follow my lead , okay ? Nathan . It 's good to see you , man . This is my daughter , Claire . Claire , this is Liam ... Samuels . President 's Chief of Staff . I live in America . Your dad and I barely survived boarding school together . Barely . Listen , I really appreciate the President giving me some time this afternoon . Sure . He just stepped up on stage , speech usually clocks in at about 90 minutes . Whatever works for him . But I 'd like to stick around close by . Absolutely . We 've got a suite upstairs . Come here . Do me a favor , sign in right here , and Frank will show you how to get up there , all right ? Okay . - Nice to meet you . You , too . I thought you were right-handed . Ambidextrous . I bat righty . Throw lefty . You coming ? Prisoners are gone . The entire unit 's been captured . Seeing as how your unit was trying to kill us , I think we caught a break . How the hell did this happen ? I tried to tell you before this whole thing started . Your men alone are never going to be a match for people with abilities . You sure this will work ? The Tasers didn 't work on Sylar , but one shot of this will put an elephant down . The trick is getting close enough to the elephant . Hiro . Hiro . - Call 911 . I gotta get to the Stanton . I gotta stop Sylar . Go . We 'll stay with him . Hello ? Thank God . Where are you ? I 'm with Nathan . Are you sure it 's him ? Oh , it 's him . Don 't worry . How do you know ? Because it 's me . God , this is fun . Don 't you love a good pinot ? My dad 's on his way . He 's gonna stop you , and then I 'm gonna kill you . No . Actually , I 'm gonna kill him . Or have you kill him . I haven 't decided yet . Don 't give me that look . Everybody dies sometime . Well , almost everybody . Pappa Petrelli , Momma Bennet , Mr. Muggles . What 's your brother 's name again ? Larry ? Lyle . Lyle . Right . He 's gonna die , too . As we speak , my father is dying . Did I tell you I got to meet my real dad ? Boy , was that a disappointment . Have you ever stopped to think about how much we have in common , Claire ? You were adopted . I was adopted . You can 't die . I can 't die . You can die . I 'll make sure of it . You 'll get bored , after , like , 100 years of trying to off me , watching all of your loved ones drop like flies . You may eventually come to forgive me . Maybe you 'll even love me . I 'll keep trying to kill you for the rest of my life . Well , everybody needs a hobby . I mean , I 'm not saying there aren 't bridges that need to be built , but if we start building them now , who knows ? You could be my first First Lady . I 'm sorry , Senator , there 's a full lockdown . No one gets in or out without talking to Mr. Samuels . You better talk to Mr. Samuels . I have Senator Nathan Petrelli requesting access to the building . Is there a problem ? He says you 're already inside . If you 're here , then who the hell 's up in that suite ? And I can either know now or after we take him down . You 're not gonna do that . You send your men up there , and they will die . He 's right . His name is Sylar , he 's extremely dangerous . And he 's a target ? He 's one of them ? He 's one of them . He ... I gotta stop saying that . He 's one of us . He 's one of us . It 's all right . Liam . I 've been lying to the President . I 've been lying to myself . And I will take full responsibility for my crimes when the day comes . But today we 're gonna course correct . There 's a man in that suite upstairs . He needs to be stopped . And how do you suggest we do that ? You don 't . We do . Sylar can only be stopped by people like us . My brother can do whatever Sylar can do , we just have to get him close enough to touch him . Just give us a five-minute head start . That 's all I 'm asking . I 'll take him high , you take him low . Let 's cut the son of a bitch in two . I love you , Pete . You know that ? 'Course . Love you , too , Nathan . Ready . Go . Are you all right ? Yeah . Where did they go ? The window . Can you fly after them ? I can 't . Come on , we have to find them . Come on . Claire 's gonna be so mad at me . It 's about time . Mrs. Petrelli , what are you doing here ? Waiting for you . How did you find me ? I had a dream . Nathan 's in trouble . Something terrible happened to him . And then you save him . I don 't know how , all I know is you have to come with me . I can 't . I 'm sorry . My dreams don 't lie , Mr. Parkman . Now , I need you to come with me . I came here to stop those agents from coming after us . I need to be able to go back to my boy and know he can live his life without being hunted . I 'm sorry about Nathan . Then we want the same thing . And without Nathan , none of that is possible . You don 't have to read minds to know that . Come with me . We should separate here . You go that way . I 'll look for Nathan over here . Hold it . Noah ? You tell me that 's Claire , not Sylar . I just fought Sylar , okay ? That is Claire . Put the gun down . Dad . It 's me . Did you take his power ? Yeah . So we can stop him . Freeze ! On the ground ! The President 's life is in danger . You want him to live , you need to listen to us . I said on the ground ! You can either listen to me now , or I 'll tell you after you shoot me . They were here . Peter and Nathan . I 'm sorry . Only authorized personnel beyond this point . This is a Secret Service badge . You 're gonna let us through . Sorry . You guys go ahead . You don 't want to see this . No , I need to . No , I need to . Mrs. Petrelli , wait . I need to . Nathan ? Nathan ? Please . No . No ! No ! I don 't understand . My dream . You were supposed to save him . This way , Mr. President . Nathan . Is that you ? Of course it 's me . We 're getting the President out through the basement . I can 't give you any more time . That 's all right . You don 't have any more time to give . This way , Mr. President . Thank God you 're all right , sir . The Secret Service did a hell of a job today . And so did you . Bet you didn 't think I took that one from you . This is insane . This will never work . You 'll make it work . It 's the only way . And it has to be right now . I don 't know how much time I bought sending Peter and Claire after Nathan . Why don 't you just chain him up ? Or tranq him . Isn 't that what you guys love to do ? I don 't want to be a part of this . Thought you came back to protect your family , Matt . I did . But what you 're asking me to do is crazy . Who will convince the President the whole thing was a mistake ? Without Nathan , nothing 's going to change . Word gets out that a person with abilities murdered a US Senator , you 're gonna have 100 Dankos out there . Even if I could do what you 're asking me to do , he would never really be Nathan . He 'd always be Sylar . Sylar can absorb all of Nathan 's memories , and the entire history of anything he touches will fill in the gaps . Physically , no one will ever know the difference . It 'll be permanent . Look . The last thing in the world I want is to see that son of a bitch still alive , and I have to lie to my family about it . But we need Sylar to be Nathan Petrelli again . Matt . You don 't do this , Nathan is gone forever . And how do we explain what happened to him ? There 's a body in deep freeze in Building 26 . It 's identical to Shape-shifter . Your son , Mr. Parkman . You just wanted to protect him . Can you honestly tell me that if something happened to him , you wouldn 't do anything , anything , to keep him in your life ? I can 't lose Nathan . Not like this . I 'm begging you . You 're no longer Sylar . No longer Gabriel Gray . That life is over . Sylar 's dead . You 're no longer Sylar . You 're no longer Sylar . No longer Gabriel Gray . That life is over . Sylar is dead . You 're now Nathan Petrelli . Nathan Petrelli , son , brother , father . Senator Nathan Petrelli . Ma ? We are all connected . Joined together by an invisible thread , infinite in its potential and fragile in its design . Yet , while connected , we are also merely individuals . Empty vessels to be filled with infinite possibilities . An assortment of thoughts , beliefs . A collection of disjointed memories and experiences . It 's a new beginning , Mom . Can I be me without these ? Can you be you ? I take it the President agreed to it ? Funding , resources , deniability . I told them I found just the man to head up our new ... What were we gonna call it ? I always liked " the Company " . I can 't believe he 's really dead . He 's really dead , Claire . He really is . And if this invisible thread that holds us together were to sever , to cease , what then ? What would become of billions of Ione , disconnected souls ? Therein lies the great quest of our lives . To find . To connect . To hold on . For when our hearts are pure and our thoughts in line , we are all truly one , capable of repairing our fragile world and creating a universe of infinite possibilities . You 're number four . I haven 't heard from you in weeks . I was beginning to worry . Nathan ? Sorry , Ma . Just haven 't felt like myself lately . Don 't be ridiculous . This is a great time for you , Nathan . The world 's your oyster . We 've put all that nonsense behind us . The family 's back together . This is your time . Now , come on , we 're going to be late for lunch . Nathan , have you heard a word I 've said ? It 's just this clock . It 's running a minute and a half fast . So , lunch ? Italian ? Chinese ?

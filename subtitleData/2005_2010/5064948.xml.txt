 Target one 's eliminated . Two and three have escaped , but we 're in pursuit . We can 't have witnesses . He gave the order to have Jack Harkness killed . - You sure ? - I 've seen it with my own eyes . We are coming . We are coming . Whoever they are , they 're coming for Britain . - But why ? - Exactly . Why is that , Mr Frobisher ? He keeps saying the same thing over and over . We are coming . I don 't mean to scare you because you 're perfectly safe , but I think aliens are using you to speak . What do you think ? No such thing . How do we know that the 456 will keep quiet ? We don 't . All we can do is hope to cover ourselves . This is us . This is Torchwood . This is home . The children promised tomorrow and tomorrow is here . Our correspondents have been measuring the situation in Australia ... The Senate have pointed out that we are now living in fear of our children . In fear of what they will say next , in fear of who or what is speaking through them . Almost lost my eyebrows . Still , good for something , see ? - Old Boy Scout . - I 'm freezing . Is anyone going to see us in here , you know , with all this firelight and stuff ? It was abandoned in the ' 90s . Used to be a Torchwood holding facility . - Torchwood One . - Rusting away for years . So what do we do ? Hmm ? Just sit here ? Worse than that , do I have to stay in these clothes ? I mean , come on , tracksuit bottoms ? Not a good look . Jack , they 're arriving today . That alien voice thing said today and we are stuck in the back end of beyond . Yeah . But we 're together , the old team . We 're down but not out , yeah ? We 've survived worse than this . Yeah . Besides , I don 't know how much fighting you should do in your condition . - What 's that mean ? - Christ , Jack . He knows you 're pregnant ? You told him before me , didn 't you ? Rhys , he just happened to be there , and it happened really , really fast . Last to know , last to bloody know ! Well , thank you very much . Don 't be stupid , man . Hey , don 't be so ... Couldn 't you just keep it shut ? All together . The old team . Tension is mounting as the population of the entire planet waits for the next incident . We 've been given no answers , no hope , no assurance that our children will come first . The government has refused to speculate about the origin of the voice or the importance of the word " tomorrow " . Let 's take you live now to Downing Street . In light of what 's happening with our children , we 've temporarily closed the schools . As a further precaution , we 've introduced a temporary curfew for everyone under the age of 18 . Keep your children at home where they 'll be safe . The curfew takes effect immediately and will continue until further notice . But rest assured , we 're doing everything in our power to find out what 's going on , to safeguard our children and all the people of this nation . In the meantime , we 're asking everyone to stay calm and to go about your lives as normal . There 's nothing to suggest we are in any danger . And as soon as we find out anything more , the public will be informed . And as always , I thank you for your trust and for your faith . Yeah , it 's me . Listen , I can 't talk . Just give her the thumbs-up , she 'll know what it means . Oh , brilliant . Thanks , Mac . You want one ? There you go . Mac says thumbs up , Ianto 's alive . Was that it ? Daft sod , well , where is he ? What 's he doing ? Thumbs up , that was all . This is Eliza . Now , she 's lactose-intolerant , so no milk . Okay , Eliza . You take your coat off . You go in there and play , all right ? That 's it now , Johnny . No more kids . I 'm full to bursting . It 's a public service . The schools are closed . People still gotta work . Life goes on . - Yeah , with you making a profit . - Ten quid a kid . Look , that could be our slogan , " Ten quid a kid . " This is Jack Harkness , leave a message and I 'll get back to you . So , we 've got guns , okay . And a pen knife , laptop , now dead , credit cards and a phone , which they can trace , Lemsip , book of stamps , pair of contact lenses and 15 quid . Plus 25 pence . With some bloody alien thing turning up today . We 've still got some of the Torchwood software , though . We 've lost the Hub , but the software still exists on the server . Trouble is , we 're going to need some more equipment . Not to mention electricity . And how are we going to manage that , hidden away like criminals ? - Well , that 's it . Brilliant . - What ? Criminals . Thieves . Us . Well , they 're treating us like criminals . Let 's be criminals . Listen , I trained with the police . I know every trick in the book . Seen the lot . Come on , boys , you 're going to learn some tricks . - Everything all right ? - Oh , yeah , fine . Thanks very much . That 'll be Â£ 15.50 . Ow , ow ! Whoa ! Come back , that 's my car ! I 'm just going to pop over the road . I won 't be a minute , okay ? Excuse me ? Excuse me , could I borrow your phone ? I just want to make a call to my sister . She 's a bit worried . It 's all this stuff with the kids and my mobile 's not working . - Is that okay ? - Yeah , sure . I won 't be long . Brilliant , thanks . Hello , Cardiff Bay Police Station . Yeah , I 'm , uh , I 'm trying to contact Captain Jack Harkness . He works for Torchwood . I know it 's not your department but , um ... No , but , I think he might have been in that explosion and I can 't get in touch with him . He 's got this private number - and he always answers it , but ... - I 'll need your name and address . - I just want to know where he is . - I 'll need your name and address . Name and address ... Lovely . Thank you very much . Thanks . Name 's Alice Carter , maiden name Alice Sangster . Parents James and Mary Sangster , which is significant 'cause James and Mary Sangster never really existed . They were placeholder names used in the early 70s for personnel that went into deep cover or witness relocation . In other words , the whole ID 's a fake . - Can you find out who she is ? - I 'm onto it . Let there be light ! Oh , yes ! Britain 's most wanted . Hey , how about that ? Guess that makes you an official member of the team . You can stick it , mate . Get on those computers and get me home , yeah ? I see we 've got a new car outside . Nice , very smart . Where 've you been ? We thought you got arrested . Just buying essentials . Technology 's one thing . But let 's not forget the creature comforts . Coffee , obviously . - Got some doo-dah . - Thank God ! And more importantly , didn 't know your exact sizes , but I reckon I got a good eye . Whoo ! Oh , brilliant . I am stinking . - Nice one . - And for you , sir , - Army surplus special . - Oh , you 're kidding me . I 'm back . Such a long time ago . But it 's all coming back , isn 't it ? 'Cause of that smell . Closer , closer . Happens today . Well , it 's always today , isn 't it ? Same as yesterday . Today and yesterday . I knew they 'd come back . Bastards always come back . I can smell them ! Just like last time , isn 't it ? Stop , stop , stop , stop , stop , stop , stop ! Stop ! That 's him . No , oh , no , don 't take me , they 'll get me . - Hold on ... - Don 't take me , get out of the way ! - That 's it . - No ! That 's it , come on . You 're making it worse , son . Stop , stop ! They 'll get me , they 'll get me ! - And we 're in . - Just like the old days . I 'll patch into the news channels , see what 's happening . - Uh , black , no sugar , yeah ? - That 's the one . No sign of anything . Empty skies . Right . Where do we start ? What are we looking for ? Run a check on that Clement McDonald . See if there 's any change . And those names Lois said . Captain Andrew Staines . What was it , Ellen Hunt ? Michael something ? All assassinated the same time they tried to kill Jack . Andrew Staines , Ellen Hunt , Michael Sanders , mean anything to you ? No , nothing . We need to get inside Whitehall . - Have you got the Eye-5 software , Ianto ? - Yeah , still on the site . Why ? Download it onto the laptop . Because these are not just contact lenses , these are Torchwood contact lenses . But what do we use them for ? Who 's going to wear them ? Well , there 's only one person still talking to us . Hello ? - Is there a Lois in here ? Lois Habiba ? - That 's me . We 're not a call centre . Hurry up . Hello ? Lois , look to your right . Don 't hang up . Don 't hang up . I need five minutes , just five minutes . I 've helped you once and that 's enough . If anybody finds out what I 'm doing , it 's treason . It 's literally treason . Offences like this can be tried without a jury . They could do anything to me . I know , but you said they 're building something at Thames House and we need to find out what it is . That 's the most secure building in the whole country . - I can 't exactly smuggle you in . - You don 't have to . You just ... Just keep your eyes open . Like this . But , where 's that coming from ? That 's not a webcam . It 's you . And to the right . And to the left . And back . - Where 's the camera ? On your jacket ? - In my eyes . Oh , my God . When you wear these , they 'll transmit a picture back to us and we can see what 's going on . More than that , we 've got lip-reading software . Just look at someone when they 're speaking and it 'll translate it . Press Enter now . Go on . Right . Now it 's working , say something . - Like what ? Like what ? - Oh my God , that 's weird . Oh my God , that 's weird . And we can send messages to you . Type something . Go on , anything . Hello , Lois . - You can see it , in your eyes ? You can see it , in your eyes ? It 's good , isn 't it ? If you wear these , we can find out what 's going on and then we can help . I can 't . What if they ... I don 't know , scan for bugs or something ? Yeah , they will , but they won 't register , I promise . I can 't , though . Giving you information 's one thing but that 's putting me right on the front line . You 're the only friend we 've got left . Even if I get into Thames House , I can 't get onto Floor 13 . That 's where they 're building this thing . But Frobisher only takes Miss Spears with him . I 'm just the office girl . - Well , you 'll have to find a way inside . - But how ? I don 't know . You ... - You 'll have to think of something . - I can 't . I 'm sorry . I 've got to go . Just take them with you , I am begging you . Just think about it . - I 've really got to go . - Please . Lois . I can 't . Please . Frobisher 's the key to this . He 's just a civil servant , he 's nothing . What makes him start authorising executions ? What did it feel like ? I mean , getting blown up ? - Wasn 't the best of days . - No . But did you feel it ? Or did everything just go black ? I felt it . - Shit . - Yeah . Do you ever think that one day your luck will run out ? That you won 't come back ? I 'm a fixed point in time and space . That 's what the Doctor says . I think that means it 's forever . So one day you 'll see me die of old age , and just keep going ? Yeah . We 'd better make the most of it , then . I suppose . Like right now ? - Ianto , the world could be ending . - The world 's always ending . And I have missed that coat . Rhys . Do you want to take the car and go to those shops down by the wharf ? We need some discs for these things . Should take about 20 minutes ? - 30 minutes . - 30 . I 'll go later , um , the beans are almost done . - The beans are almost done . - Bloody beans . Whoa , that 's nice . Look at that . Face recognition software . And , arrested two hours ago in London . He wouldn 't give his name , but that is Clement McDonald . That 's the man from the hospital . Could be useful . Gwen ? I 've given her the contacts but God knows , I think she 's too scared . No , we 've got a new little mission for you . That Clem 's turned up , Camden Police Station , of all places . Arrested for theft and minor affray . Could you get him out ? - How am I supposed to do that ? - You were a policewoman . Oh , okay , bloody hell , anything else while I 'm at it ? - Fillet steak would be nice . - Yeah , don 't push it . See you later . - So , Ianto , what 's his story ? - Ah , well , according to Gwen , it was your classic alien abduction back when he was a kid . 1965 . He was living 10 miles outside Arbroath , the Holly Tree Lodge . It was an orphanage . Looked up the files . The kids were taken away November 1965 . The Lodge was closing down . They were being taken to a second care home called Harbour Heights in Plymouth , except that 's where the records stopped . There 's no trace of them arriving . I mean , it was the ' 60s , a lot of the paperwork 's gone missing . But if what he 's saying is true , maybe they never got there . - Show me those people . - What people ? Andrew Staines , Ellen Hunt , Michael Sanders . The ones that were killed the same day as me . - Why , do you think there 's a connection ? - Show me . No , no , give me their history . Show me them 40 years ago . - What for ? - Just do it . Who are they , Jack ? Do you know them ? - I never knew their names . - Who were they ? Jack , tell me . Did you know them ? - Jack ! - Hey , the beans are ready . Alice Carter . I 've broken the security wall . You 're gonna love this . What is it ? Any sign of Harkness ? Sins of the past . Did you know that he 's got a daughter ? - Since when ? - Alice Carter . She was put into deep cover way back in 1977 at the request of her mother , seeking to distance herself from the life of Captain Jack . - Can hardly blame her . - Who was the mother ? A woman called Lucia Moretti . Italian . Torchwood staff 1968 to 1977 . Deceased . Heart disease , 2006 . Natural causes . That 's rare for Torchwood . And now Alice Carter 's got a child of her own , his grandson . Could be useful . What do you want me to do ? - Bring her in . - Just the answer I wanted . Nothing from Jodrell Bank , but we might as well get ready . Bridget , get everything you need . We 'll transfer to Thames House . What do you want me to do ? Exactly what you 're doing now . Just answer the phones . Or I could come with you to Thames House . I could help . I don 't think so . The thing is , Mr Frobisher asked me to come . - When was that ? - He said he wanted me . At his side . What for ? Why on Earth would he need you ? It was a ... private conversation . You 're not the first , you know . Don 't go thinking you 're the first . Then I can come ? Apparently so . - Andy Davidson . Andy , listen ... - You 're alive ? - Yes , I 'm still alive , you idiot . Now , shut up , I need some help . We need you . All these kids saying , " We are coming . " And that 's today . I mean , what 's it going to be ? Like a spaceship ? - Oh , Andy . - Or Godzilla ? Just listen ! I need you to release a prisoner from Camden Police Station . - The address is Albany Street . - What are you doing in Camden ? - Does it matter ? - It does to me , aye . Yes . I know , I 'm sorry . Look , just listen , I 've got no ID , so I need you to vouch for me . He 's only on minor charges , so I can stand bail . You need to phone them and fax a WC242A . Don 't use my name , use Lynda 's . I 'll say I 'm Lynda . Can you do that for me , please ? - Okay . - Like now ? Clem ? Do you remember me ? Oh . It 's all right . It 's boring . I want to see aliens . Yeah ? Be careful what you wish for . Put some cartoons on . Steven , come on , we 're going out . Quickly , now . The telly said we 've got to stay inside . Never mind that . Now , listen to me . We 're going to go out and you 're going to be quiet , okay ? Don 't make a sound . Just like those games your gran used to teach you , do you remember ? Are we in trouble ? Gran always said there 'd be trouble . Then do exactly what she said . Just like the games . Nice and quiet and don 't let me out of your sight . Come on . - Clear ! - Clear ! - Get out of the way . - Go on then , shoot . Let 's see what happens . Are you as immortal as your father ? Is the boy ? We can put it to the test . - Take me , let him go . - No . He 's only a child . So ? Alice , if we wanted you dead , we 'd have opened fire by now . Just put down the gun . - Who are you ? - Put down the gun . If you harm him , I will kill you . Understood . And the knife . Certainly your father 's daughter , I 'll give you that . Come on , sweetheart . Steven , what is it ? What are you doing ? - Steven , what is it ? - What 's he pointing at ? Steven , stop it . Please stop it . Steven , look at me . Steven , stop it ! It 's them . We charge extra for cleaning . Tell your mum it 's another two quid . What is it ? Stop it . Can you hear me ? Lilly , it 's Mum . Just look at me . Just look at me ! What is it ? Clem ? - It 's them . It 's all of them , the kids . - What are they saying ? They 're not . Just pointing . Yet again , every child has stopped . Every single child in the world . There seem to be no reports of speech , only that they seem to be indicating something in the sky . - It 's on the news , they 're pointing . - I know . But they 're pointing over there . What 's over there ? Says all the children in America are pointing east and all the children in Europe are pointing west . It 's us . They 're pointing at us . Go far enough in that direction , that 's London . They 're pointing at London . According to reports , children in London are all pointing towards the centre of the city . To repeat , children in London all seem to be pointing towards the centre . They 're pointing at Thames House . Come on . It 's happening . - Sorry , you just stay here . - But you haven 't got authorisation . We are here . It 's them . They 're back . Come on , you 're connected to them . We need to find out how . Speak . My name is John Frobisher , Permanent Secretary to the Home Office of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland , Earth . On behalf of the human race , I ... Is there something wrong ? Do you want me to continue ? Then , if I could request , for the purpose of communication , we 've no name for your species . What are you called ? You call us 456 . - That 's correct . - Then that is our name . If I could request , on behalf of my government , what is it that you want ? Can you hear me ? I 'm sorry , but I need to know before I approach my superiors , what exactly do you want ? I must ask the 456 officially your purpose in visiting ... Speak . I am speaking . We would speak . With who ? The world . Why ? We would speak . Well , perhaps we do things differently here , but we would consider this to be a diplomatic liaison . Does that make sense ? We are both , in a sense , ambassadors . And according to protocol , ambassadorial procedure is not made public . You wouldn 't be speaking to the entire population , but to their elected representatives . That 's-that 's-that 's how it works . That 's all I can offer . Is that acceptable ? Yes . Good . Thank you . Bring them . Thank you . I have one condition . Does that make sense ? Do you understand that ? A condition ? The 456 have made contact with this country before . Many years ago . It would be better if ... I mean , given the nature of that meeting , it would ensure the smooth running of diplomatic relations between Earth and the 456 if that previous encounter was kept off the record . By off the record , I mean private . Between us . Can you do that ? Yes . Thank you . Soon . - I 'm sorry ? - Return soon . I will . Thank you . The area around Thames House is being cordoned off while the government ... It is all kicking off now . Just when we need Jack . ... at Downing Street . These images are from five minutes ago . That 's been identified as Colonel Oduya of the Unified Intelligence Task Force . And this is coming live . That 's General Austin Pierce , representing the American Armed Forces . He 's heading inside Downing Street right now . I 've been asked to convey from the President of the United States his absolute fury . - Is that understood ? - Very much so . That landing wasn 't spontaneous . It was planned . It was prepared by you . And don 't go calling this diplomacy , Mr Green . You 've established a court , the sovereign court of Great Britain , in direct contradiction of the statutes of the United Nations . - We were acting under orders . - Did they threaten you ? I think we can say that the mere existence of the 456 is a threat . Nevertheless , you have an alien ambassador on British soil . It has to be said that Britain has claimed no rights of territory - or ownership over species 456 . - But it 's here . You 've damn well got it right here . And at every stage of these negotiations you have excluded UNIT , when we 're specially trained to deal with these situations . And I apologise . But the President 's welcome to enter Floor 13 , as is every other leader of the free world . - I ... I 'd be honoured . - Except that 's impossible . And you know it . We will not move the President into a location that 's had no security screening . That 'll take days to organise . Weeks . Then I offer to withdraw . What does that mean ? I won 't usurp the United States or any other nation . I suggest that dialogue with the 456 is taken out of my hands - and conducted by the civil service . - They 're still British . But not elected , with no authority of state . And that 's exactly what we need , middle men . John Frobisher 's already spoken to the 456 . - I suggest he continues . - I 'd suggest that UNIT steps in . I wish it were so , but the 456 chose Britain . They designated the location . It 's out of my control . What do you want to do , anger them ? Look , John Frobisher 's a good man . And better than that , he 's expendable . So , what do you say ? Do we have your absolute guarantee that you won 't enter the room ? My absolute guarantee . Then that 's agreed . Agreed . - John ? - Prime Minister , sir . We 've consulted with the military . They 've demanded that from now on you become our spokesperson in all negotiations with the 456 . Simon can give you a security briefing . Thank you . Shit . Well , I 'm the last to know . My own husband , he won 't tell me what 's going on . Got the girls pointing at the sky and he won 't say . No , there 's nothing . Been flicking through the news channels . They weren 't saying anything . Yeah . Yeah , I know . If I hear anything , I 'll let you know . Yeah , okay , bye . Lilly ! Downstairs , please . I want you where I can see you . A so-called pillar of fire has brought central London to a halt . All roads leading to the river have been closed off . As a result , all major thoroughfares have ground to a standstill . Motorists are being asked to stay out of the city centre except for emergencies . Oh , that 's so bloody Jack ! You should have stopped him . Well , I don 't know . We 're going to be ages . It 's gridlock . Bloody London ! Half the people panicking , trying to get out . The other half are trying to get in ! Look , I 'm going to have to go , okay ? Bye . Hey , it 's all okay , Clem . You 're safe , you 're with me . You 're safe . You 're with me . - You 're all right . You 're safe . - I keep remembering more . It 's not just them up there . It 's the man . He 's come back , after all these years . - I can smell him . - What man ? Who is he ? It 's the same man . I knew he 'd come back for me . All right , time I got you a nice cup of tea . And a hot dog . Do you like hot dogs ? I bloody love ' em . I 'm recommending we start at 1900 . That gives us another two hours . Now , this is Louise . She can advise on international diplomatic protocols . There 's a creature in that room . It 's powerful and it 's toxic and it 's capable of God knows what . I bet you 're glad to be trotting after John Frobisher now . Stuart 's the linguistics expert , he can help out if there 's a problem with translation . Oh , excuse me , I 'd better take this . I was going to phone you . God , I wish I was at home right now . Look , just tell the girls that there 's nothing to worry about . Oh , I 'll tell them that , Johnny boy . I 'll tell them that their father tried to have me killed . How about that ? That 's my wife 's phone . How did you get my wife 's phone ? This is 1965 , isn 't it ? All of this because of 1965 . Frobisher , tell me , is it them ? Have they come back ? Yes . That 's why you tried to have me killed . Along with Andrew Staines and Ellen Hunt and Michael Sanders . All of us dead so no one could say anything , is that it ? I had no choice . Well , I 've got a choice . Do you want to hear my choice ? I could blow this thing sky-high . I could tell the world . Unless you get me into Thames House . I demand to talk to the 456 myself . Think about it . The fact that they 've come back proves that they can 't be trusted . You need me . Captain , we have your daughter and grandson . Alice and Steven Carter are in our custody . You what ? I promise , nothing will happen to them . I absolutely promise . So long as you agree to say nothing . Yeah , well , how about I go back into that house right now and get your wife ? And your children ? Except you won 't , 'cause you 're a better man than me . I 'm sorry , Jack . The world is still waiting for any news from Thames House . So far , the British government is maintaining a policy of absolute silence . And the waiting continues . - Here you go . - Mmm . Save some for the rest of us , mate . He 's your husband ? Yes , yes , my beloved . Nice house , isn 't it ? - Well , we do our best . - It 's got shower facilities . Just stand under the skylight . I 've stayed in worse . And who 's the queer ? Oi ! It 's not 1965 any more . He 's queer . I can smell it . If the support staff could take the stairs , the lift is reserved for Mr Frobisher and his personal staff . Fast as you can ! Best of luck , sir . Big moment . History . - What do you think is in there ? - God knows . That 's why we need Lois . No sign of her . Lenses inactive . Two minutes ! Um , I 'm just going to ... pay a visit . - Online . She 's doing it . - Oh , good girl ! I knew she would . - Oh God , don 't do too much of that . Don 't do too much of that . - Sorry . - She can 't hear you . I know . Is that you , Gwen ? Right , then . - Good luck . Good luck . No , don 't do that . I hate smileys . Took me a while to get used to those things . - What ? You 've used the lenses ? - Yeah . That 's why Gwen had them . I only took them home for a bit of fun . Fun ? You know , fun . Yeah , well , been there , done that . - It is fun . Yeah . - That 's him . That 's John Frobisher . - Oh , bastard ! Fat lot of good that is . Back of his head ! How do we know if he 's saying anything ? I suppose it 's an honour , given this position . Then again , the Prime Minister has guaranteed that diplomatically , he can 't enter 413 . So whatever happens in there , whatever goes wrong , history will say that it wasn 't his fault . Do you mean he 's using me ? You don 't get to be Prime Minister by accident . What the hell is that ? Some sort of tank . There 's something inside the smoke . Clem , come see this . Oh , come on , don 't be scared . It 's miles away . What do you think ? Anything you 've seen before ? Can 't smell it from here . Is that what tried to take me ? Yeah , I think so . - Seen anything like it before ? - Never . Thank you , if I might bring to session the first diplomatic congress between the representatives of planet Earth and representatives of the 456 . I bring you formal greetings from the United States of America , from the People 's Republic of China ... - He 's got his back to us . - Yeah , I can see that . From the Holy See of Vatican City ... - " Need his moth " ? - Shut up . From the Russian Federation and associated of Australia , from the provinces and territories and Japan , and the Hellenic Republic , from the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq , from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , and it must be stated on the record that any country not named herein does not indicate their withdrawal from this ... That 's it . Come on , good girl . ... reflects only the time span within which this summit has been declared . You 've got eyes . You 've got eyes in the room . The software 's not so good in profile . And according to the rules of protocol as established according to the rules of protocol ... - That 's not too bad . - It 's working . ... from 1968 , that which by we ... - You hate smileys . - Shut up . I must ask you to state whether these greetings are accepted . Do you understand me ? Do you understand me ? I repeat , according to the rules of protocol , as established by the United Nations and the directives ... Yes . Then I thank you on behalf ... Then I thank you on behalf of the United Kingdom . Did it speak ? It hasn 't got a mouth . It 's got bloody speakers . It hasn 't got a mouth ! The Russian Federation , the Commonwealth of Australia and territories of Canada , and Japan , and the Hellenic Republic , the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq . That 's bloody shorthand . No , I can read it . It says , " Yes . " This is a nightmare . And the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . I think it might be easier if we take those names as read from now on , don 't you ? What 's it doing ? I don 't know . - " What 's it doing ? " - What ? Is that what it said ? No , that 's Lois saying that . Are you all right ? I 'm sorry , but I can 't help being concerned . Is there a problem ? I 'm sorry , but I can 't help being concerned . Is there a problem ? Do you want me to continue ? Yes . " Yes . " Right , then , in the spirit of cooperation we have a formal request to make . We ask you not to use our children for communication , in case certain parties or territories might consider that a violation . Is that acceptable ? Yes . " Yes . " Thank you . Ask it why it came to Britain . Hardly top of the agenda . Ask the question . And as a gift , and as welcome to this world , we 've prepared a document summarising our culture and history . This document can be made available to you immediately , though its format remains undetermined . Said format remains of your choosing , though this does not constitute a request for information on or transfer of specific 456 technology . I 've been given a request for specific information . It has been asked why the 456 chose Great Britain as its chosen point of embarkation . We came here . " We came here . " - Because ... - That 's all it said . You have no significance .

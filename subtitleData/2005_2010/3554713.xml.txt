 Previously on the 4400 ... We 're not sure what 's just happened . The light is gone . And thousands of people have just suddenly appeared . Some of them have been missing over 60 years . None of them have any memory of what happened to them . I saw your brother . Shawn ? You know those visions that maia used to have . It turns out she was only pretending that they stopped . Don 't give me that look , tom . You kept shawn 's ability to yourself for quite some time . I 've cured emphysema , leukemia ... I don 't get why these attacks keep coming back . That baby really kicked your ass . Heidi , it 's mommy . Who ? I have another family now , and I 'm sorry . I know that 's not fair to you , but ... brian , I am still part of your life . If you 're losing chunks of time , you should talk to your dad about it . You told me everything that happened that night , right ? Yeah . It 's okay , it 's okay . Jordan . You don 't have to keep vigil , shawn . Are you going to cancel the appearance at riverfront park ? No . That would be a mistake . They 're not just honoring me . They 're honoring the center and all the work we 've done . - A new neurological clinic just opened in atlanta . No , look , look . I 've been to all the specialists , shawn . There 's no name for what I have . We can 't just give up . There 's got to be a way to figure out what that baby did to you . I know what that baby did to me . It saved my life . What ? What are you talking about ? When I touched lily 's pregnant belly and was hit with that pain I realized I 'd been judged and found wanting . - By a baby that wasn 't even born yet ? - In that moment ... I was forced to see the truth about myself , about my motives toward the 4400 , and they were ... not pure . That baby tried to kill you . And it succeeded . It killed the old jordan collier , and I was reborn , pure of purpose . All I 've done since , everything I 've built , I owe to richard , to lily ... and to that child . I 'll get it . - Hey . - Hi . Come in . Lily ... look who 's here . We would have called , but heidi wanted to surprise you . Heidi ... hi , mom . She 's so cute . Now that you guys are living on the block , I figured it was time for heidi to meet her real mom . That makes you my second dad . I guess so . Mom , why are you crying ? Lily , are you all right ? - Lily ? - Lily ? Lily ? Lily ? Sweetheart , wake up . It was a dream ... more like a nightmare . No , no . We were living next door to heidi and brian , and we were all getting along . And the house ... richard , it was so pretty . So why were you crying ? I guess I knew it wasn 't real . How long can we keep going before someone catches up to us ? We just got to keep moving , stay ahead of collier and ntac . I 'm just so tired of running . We 're going to find a place to stop running . It 's out there ... got to be . That 's good . You 've come so far . Nice use of color . It 's shaping up , greg , but I think it could use some work . That 's as good as it gets . Don 't waste your time . Ms. Tobey , would you come with us , please ? Harmon . sam ... what 's this all about ? Ms. Tobey , I 'm placing you under arrest . Arrest ? For what ? Child abuse . Oh , my god . What ... So long ago , another life I can feel your heart beat it 's not a dream remember us I can see it in your eyes we 'll find our place in time our place in time beyond the sun we 'll find our place in time our place in time to call our own Look I know his birth certificate says the kid 's 21 . But emotionally kyle is still a teenager . I 've got to accept the fact that he 's gonna screw up like a teenager . He 'll learn from his mistakes . Get it out of his system . But shawn ... it 's been a year . How could he cut us out like that ? And danny . He 's eating himself up inside . He used to be such a sweet boy . Yeah . I remember what pop used to say ... " you think you 've got problems ? Wait till you become a parent . Little did we know . Yeah . What do you want to bet they 're talking about us downstairs ? That 's what they live for . If they didn 't have us to worry about . They 'd die of boredom . I 've seen you around campus . I saw you too . Why didn 't you say something ? It 's been . Like . Four years . I mean . What was I supposed to say . " Welcome back from coma world " ? I don 't know . I guess seeing you reminded me of shawn . You two were always so tight . And you were like our shadow ... " where you going ? Can I come too ? " I thought you guys were so cool . I was 14.What did I know ? Mom says you talked to him ? I don 't think he heard me . You know . I used to blame shawn for everything ... stealing nikki . Running out on us the way he did . Breaking mom 's heart . But it wasn 't his fault . And the bastards who took him sent him back a freak . They 're the ones . Guess they screwed us all up . Well . I want to thank councilman lowe on behalf of the 4400 center for this wonderful honor . In funding this cleanup project . I wanted to pay tribute not only to the glories of the past but to the promise of the future . I believe that the actions we take . The choices we make will create the kind of future that we and our children and their children will live in . Thank you . Hey . Hey ! What ? Get your hands off of me . What do you want to do . Break it ? Stop it ! Hey ! What 's the deal ? These people don 't belong here . No . You 're the ones who don 't belong here . This used to be our home until you scumbags decided to make everything beautiful and kicked us out . It 's okay . You can let ' em go . They were stealing food . Well . Last time I checked . The food was free . Don 't make me pull rank . Come on . Yes . Sir . Mr. Farrell . Thank you . Big shot . Huh ? I 'm impressed . I 'm really sorry that we trashed your home . I am . You should be . It 's a hell of a lot warmer here than crashing near l-90 bridge . Food 's still free . Right ? Yes . Absolutely . Please be my guest . Yeah . We will . Protect the future . Huh ? Got to have one first . Even on the map . Fairview seems far away . That 's four hours tops . This is my first time spending the night away from maia . Isn 't your sister with her ? The one with all the tattoos ? Sorry . Those beer kegs kyle ordered should be showing up right about now . Yeah . You read these charges ? " Teacher is accused of reckless endangerment . Placing her students health . Welfare . And safety at risk . " Could that be any more vague ? Well . That could be anything from grabbing them on the arms to touching them on the privates . Or maybe she did nothing . Yeah . " Nothing " would be my vote . A 4400 serial killer was bad enough . But a 4400 child molester ? You 're damn right we don 't want her back ! Not now . Not ever . Look . I don 't know what 's going to happen with ms . Tobey . She 's out on bail . Right ? That 's right . And her bond was paid by parents from this school . Yeah . And if they 're not worried about their kids . Then we 'll worry for them . Ask sal here . He 'll tell you . His kid was abused . Same as melinda and teddy . What about your child . Mr ... Venner . Frank venner . It 's not like she didn 't try with my boy . Greg just happened to be one of the lucky ones . Tried what ? Now . Who the hell are you two ? I 'm agent skouris . This is agent baldwin . We 're with ntac . Great . You got here just in time . Yeah . Cops let her go . You can take her to quarantine or stick her back in jail . She hasn 't been found guilty of anything yet . She 's a 4400.isn 't she ? She should never have been allowed back in this school in the first place . According to the preliminary exams . None of the kids showed any signs of abuse . No marks . No bruises ? No physical signs . At any rate . So what are we talking about ? Some kind of mental abuse ? Personally . I 'm not convinced it 's abuse at all . But there 's no denying that some of her students have been changed . Changed ? In what way ? That was beautiful . I guess . You 're telling me two weeks ago you 'd never played a violin . Never even touched one . Hey . I only took this class ' cause art appreciation 's supposed to be a guaranteed " A. You 're supposed to learn about dead painters and stuff . It 's so cool . I look at a bunch of clay . I see the figure I want to mold . I just carve away the pieces I don 't need and there it is . You should see the way she stares at you . It 's like she 's drilling a hole . Trying to get in there and rearrange your brain . One minute . She was touching my shoulder . The next thing I remember . She was handing me a violin . And I 'm standing there wondering what the hell am I doing with a paintbrush in my hand . And then I see this block of clay . And it was like . " Where have you been all my life ? " My dad 's big dream was to get me a football scholarship . It used to be my dream . Too . But this painting stuff . I 'm really into it now . Ms. Tobey 's the best teacher I ever had in my life . My dad says these kids may seem normal now . But in . Like . Two years . They might develop brain tumors . Go blind . Crazy . Who knows ? You guys should throw her back in jail . Your dad . He wouldn 't be frank venner . By any chance . Would he ? How 'd you know ? Oh . Just ... a wild guess . Hurt my students ? That 's so ridiculous . Well . It 's not ridiculous to these parents . People get scared when they don 't recognize their kids . But they 're still the same kids . I just find what 's already inside them and help bring it out . How do you do that ? I study them . Sometimes . There 's a light in their eyes . Like a tiny flame . And while I 'm watching . It gets brighter . That 's when I know there 's something in them . Something beautiful . So this light . Have you seen it in anyone else ? It doesn 't seem to work with grownups . It doesn 't work with every kid . Either . Like this one boy . Greg venner . I keep looking . But so far ... I think his father 's pretty adamant that you stop looking . Frank ? I taught frank . He was one of my first students back in ' 72 . The fact is . I probably taught half the parents who are out to get me . This is crazy . I - I haven 't done anything wrong . I need to get back to my kids . The people who took me . It can 't be an accident they gave me this wonderful gift . That 's why they sent me back . To use it . Tyler ? Richard tyler ? Richard tyler . Yes . I 'm richard tyler . As wind carved the lung feel like 10 hours WHAT 've WE GOT SHOW FOR IT ? Less than 20 bucks what we ganna do ? Gotta make it lived who 's got this no one friends treat Hey . Shawn . look who showed . I was in the mood for pizza . I didn 't feel like eating alone . So ¡ £ ¡ £ ¡ £ my very own fairy godfather . Or are you just some rich boy looking to rent some down-and-dirty for the night ? I 'm not here for that . What 's the matter ? Am I not good enough for you ? Maybe I 'm not good enough for you . I can get behind that . Yo . Wayne . Pepperoni . You going to stand there and watch . Or you going to sit down and eat ? Hello ? Brian . It 's me . Lily . Lily . Where are you ? You know . Ntac 's been calling me all summer trying to find you . Brian . look . I need your help . Richard ¡ £ ¡ £ ¡ £ he 's been arrested . Ou 're a lawyer . I need you to call the sheriff 's office in weldon . Idaho . See what you can find out . Well . I don 't know what I can do for the guy . I 'm not a criminal lawyer . Brian . If you don 't want to help ... I swear to god . Lily . You disappear for over a year . And then you call me up with these stories about the police arresting your boyfriend ... richard 's my husband . We have a child . A six-month-old girl . How 's heidi ? She 's good . Started seventh grade and ¡ £ ¡ £ ¡ £ aced her first semester . That 's wonderful . Brian . I 'm sorry to be bothering you with this . But I have nowhere else to turn . Okay . I 'll make a few calls and do whatever I can . I got to admit . The first time mike came home with that violin and started playing . His mom and me . We were both a little spooked . So why did you help pay heather 's bail ? I would 've paid the whole thing if I could 've afforded it . My wife . She shot a video of mike playing . Sent it over to the conservatory . Next day . They called back . Said our son was a prodigy . Did you tell them he 'd been playing for only two weeks ? Well . They thought I was putting them on . Talked about how his playing was worthy of a scholarship . You know . I thought this kid was going to wind up working on the assembly line like his old man . Now he 's got a way out . Hmm . Ms. Tobey 's at ntac today for a physical . We 're asking the parents of the students she 's " gifted " to come in to be interviewed . No problem . I 'll call his mom . We 'll do anything we need to to get heather back in that classroom . Great . Thanks . You should 've seen them chowing down on the pizza . Just getting enough to eat . You konw it 's such a struggle . And you made that struggle a little easier . I 'm proud of you . Shawn . I 'm thinking about going back down there . There 's so much they need-jackets . Sleeping bags . Maybe a couple of first aid kits . Basic stuff to survive . You know . You give them all the supplies they need . - All right . - But look . Whatever you do . Shawn . Don 't reveal your healing ability . Why ? 'Cause they can 't pay ? No . Because if you heal one of them . You 'll have to heal them all . I mean it . Not even you can do that . Yeah . I 'm listening . When was this ? Sweet . I 'm a little rusty . One of these days . I 'm going to write a concept album about my time on the street . Oh . I 'm gonna win a grammy . Make the bling-bling . You know . And get a private jet . One of those big old gated houses with enough room for wayne . Kimmy . And shadow . Sounds like a plan . Yeah . It matches your eyes . Sweetie . Hey . First time in months I haven 't seen him shivering . It 's amazing what a warm coat 'll do . You got yourself that guitar . Huh ? No . Actually . You know what ? I got you a guitar . What 's the matter . Baby girl ? You act like you never had a present before . It 's been a while . You touch this . You die . - " Touch it . You die ? " - I guess so . What does that mean ? I hate lines . Hate waiting in ' em . Trust me . There 'll be no waiting tonight . I been to this club plenty of times . I know the bouncer . He 'll let us walk right in . I hope you 're right . I hate waiting in lines . Hey . That book you 're reading is nothing but lies . Excuse me . I 'm talking to you . That trash is going to rot your mind . Danny . What 's going on ? She ought to be careful . That book 's a load of bull . - I bought it for her . - Yeah ? Big mistake . Anyone ask your opinion ? Danny . Come on . Man . Just watch my back . Okay ? Listen . Pal . Let me tell you a little something about cults . What 's going on ? You letting me go ? Hello . Richard . What 's with the dopey grin ? Nothing . Just the way that you ... you bite on your tongue when you 're trying to concentrate . I 've been doing that since I was a kid . How long have you been in seattle ? Two years . Left my mom and her new boyfriend and came out here for the music . Somehow . My life took a weird turn . I 've had a few of those myself . What . You run away from home too ? Um ... sort of . Except I lucked out . I found a place to run to . Otherwise ... you would have wound up like the rest of us rejects ? Something like that . You 're one of those 4400 guys . Huh ? Can you make my eyes turn green ? What . You able to walk on water ? I like your eyes the way that they are . And I can barely swim . Come on . Now . What the hell is this ? Dewey ... I see you been keeping busy . No baby . He 's just some guy ... bought us some food and blankets . Liv . Who is this guy ? Shawn . You got to go . I 'd listen to her . What are you doing ? Well . See . She does whatever I tell her to do . Do you have a problem with that ? Yeah . Yeah . I do . Shawn . Please . You 've done your good deed . Just ... just go home . Okay ? Please . Come with me . Come with me . And then what ? What . You gonna rescue me ? I don 't want to be saved . Get the hell out of here . Go . I mean it . Go ! Hey . You 're not going back to that school . Not till that woman is gone . But what about my other classes ? I 've got homework . Since when do you care about school ? You want me to wind up like you ? Hey . You watch your mouth . I don 't want to fall behind . " Fall behind " ? With the grades you 've been bringing home ? You been behind since your first report card . What . You just going to sit there . Or are you going to talk to me ? 'Cause I really think you owe me an explanation . You know . Those guys wanted to kill me . And I turn around . And my cousin 's nowhere in sight . I don 't know what happened . Yeah . I know what happened-you ran out on me . It 's a good thing that security guard was there . The other time . I could blame it on the beer . You drink too much . You can black out . Right ? But today . I didn 't drink anything . I 'm blacking out . losing chunks of time . It 's like they did something to my wiring . They ? Kyle . Who are you talking about ? The same ones who took shawn . Who put me in the coma . They left me messed up inside . Hey . Man . You 're scaring me . How do you think I feel ? Brian . Any news ? Yeah . I got ahold of the weldon authorities . And richard 's been released from custody . Oh . Thank god . When ? About an hour ago . Why hasn 't he called ? You sure you don 't want to call lily . Let her know you 're all right ? Am I ? You 're in no danger from me . Richard . All I want is to make you an offer . If it 's not to your liking . You can walk out of here . You 'll never see me again . How much did you pay those cops to call you instead of ntac to get my picture into their hands ? It 's my money . Richard . Look . You said I was free to go after I heard your offer . If you got one for me . Make it . I want you to come home . You and your family . To the 4400 center . I don 't think so . You said you read my book . Which means you know why we were taken and what we 're meant to do . The future ... The future rests in our hands . Richard . You . Me . Lily - we are the chosen ones . Come on . Jordan . We both know this has nothing to do with me or lily . This is all about isabelle . Isabelle . Well . That 's a lovely name . For once . Why don 't you say what you really want ... to take her from us . Control her . Your daughter is the future . I believed that then . I believe it now . Then what 's changed ? I have . I 'll need more than your word . Of course . Bring me to isabelle . Let her judge me . Isabelle 's not coming anywhere near you . What are you afraid of . Richard ? I 'm the one at risk . I 'm still suffering the after-effects of our last encounter . Richard . It 's simple . If I 'm lying . If my motives are not pure . Isabelle will punish me accordingly . And you 'll be free of me once and for all . But if I 'm sincere . If isabelle accepts me . Well . Then . I can offer you and lily and the child a new life . Stop running . Richard . Forget it . It 's not going to happen . There 's no way I 'm going to allow isabelle anywhere near that man . But think about it . If collier really has changed . It means we can get off the road . Stop running . That 's a big if . He offered to act as a middleman between us and ntac . Says he can get them to back off . And you believe him ? He 's got lawyers . A whole organization behind him . We can barely even pay for gas . He 's lied to us before . The man tried to destroy our relationship . Okay . Let 's say he is lying . Maybe all of this is some kind of trap ... to get his hands on our daughter . He wants a face-to-face with isabelle ? I say we give it to him . You 've seen what she 's capable of . What she can do if she feels threatened . It still feels like an awful big risk . For collier . Stand back . Let her through . Get out of here ! Welcome back . Heather . I 'm sorry about all of this . Once the media loses interest . Things will die down . Until it does . We need to discuss how you intend to handle security . Let me get heather situated . Then I 'll meet you in my office . Come on . - Don 't get comfortable . Freak ! You 're not staying ! I like this one with the smoke and the clouds ... Greg . Does your father know you 're here ? It 's all your fault . Everything was okay till you showed up . Greg . Please put the gun down . No . You made me do this . I have no choice . Yes . You do . But only if you put the gun away . I can 't be here anymore . My dad won 't let me . This is my last chance . Greg . Calm down ... no ! Not until you change me like you did them . You have to ! There 's nothing to discuss . I 'll take anything . Violin . Painting . Photography . I don 't care ! Listen . Greg . You 're problem is with me . Not your classmates . Let them go . And you and i will deal with this alone . Yeah . Sure . That works for me . Okay . I 'd like you all to leave now . Quietly . Don 't run . Ms. Tobey . Will you be okay ? Move ! Go on . For an entire week ? Is that really necessary ? To and from school . Strictly as a precaution . - A continued police presence will send a clear message to anyone who feels they can - - Okay . So now we 're alone . Now . Do whatyou promised ! Would you put the gun down . - No ! - Greg ? Please . Put the gun down . It scares me . Well good . It 's supposed to scare you ! Greg ... D.A. Says we don 't have a criminal case . Fine . We 'll take it to civil court . - One way or another - - excuse us . Hey . Buddy . What 's your problem ? You 're needed inside . I don 't feel any different . Greg . I 'm trying . Well . Try harder . You found it in mike . In rita ... you can find it in me ! I told you . I told you she was dangerous . None of you would listen . She 's not the one holding the gun . Greg is a kid . He doesn 't know what he 's doing . She 's got his mind all twisted . I got news for you . I knew everything I needed to know the first time I talked to greg . You 're the one who twisted his mind . - You put that gun in his hand . - That is not true . We both know it 's true ... and now you 're the only one who 's going to get your son out of this alive . Good . Whatever talents they have were there to begin with . But we 're only talking about a handful of students . You found it in them . You can find it in me . You have to . Before I wind up like him ... you know . My dad . Is that what you 're afraid of ? - You were worried she was going to damage your son ? You know what my dad 's like . He 's nothing . He 's a big . Angry nothing . And that 's exactly what he wants me to be . And I can 't let that happen . Now . Goddamn it . Do something ! It 's no good . Is it ? There 's nothing there . I 'm sorry . Greg . Not everybody 's meant to be an artist or a musician . You 'll find a place . Sure I will . I have a talent for failure . Just like him . You don 't have to become like your father . Somewhere along the line . He made a choice . You can make a different one . A better one . She 's right . Greg . Dad ? The mistakes I made ... they 're mine . They 're not yours . Just because I failed . It doesn 't mean that you have to . Please put down the gun . Greg . Don 't - don 't let my mistakes get you killed . Yo . Shawn ! You got to do something man . He 's knocking the crap out of her . What are you talking about ? Dewey sold that guitar you got liv . Now he 's all cranked up . Screaming and whatnot . She needs you . Come on . Come on A liv ? I begged him . Told him he was taking too much ! Dude 's dying . No ! No ! No ! Jesus ... what did you do ? He brought him back . What the hell happened ? What happened ? This guy just saved your life . Thank you . My leg ... please fix it . I 'm sorry , it doesn 't work like that . Why not ? You helped him . I ... save us ! No , I can 'T . I can 't help everyone . I 'm sorry . Have mercy on us . I 'm sorry . I can 't help everyone . I can 't help everyone . I ... I can 't help everyone ! No ! They need you . You sure about this ? Yeah , I 'm sure . Lily ... good to see you . And this is isabelle . Hi . Yes . Yes . How 's that ? Well , I guess that 's it . Good-bye fairview . At least , this time , it 's your call . I 'll find another town , another school , maybe work as a private tutor for a while . I just have to figure out a way to use this gift of mine without causing so much pain . Well , the world could always use a little more beauty . I hope so . Good luck . Thanks . You know , I was thinking of getting maia piano lessons . Oh yeah ? I bet she 'd like that . Or maybe even study painting , 'cause she 's always coloring . I guess you could call that a ripple effect . A positive one .

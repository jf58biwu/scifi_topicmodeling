United States Secret Service Operations Report Final Report : 2008 Denver Agent-Involved Shooting You 're going to jail , missy ! Well , better safe than sorry , right ? What are you talking about ? Unexplained suicides up in Riverton . We are off to see the warden . You use soap on a rope ? Hey , I don 't judge your personal hygiene products . Although you might wanna invest and get some moisturizers . You look a little dry around the nose . Oh , you want to swap beauty tips . Then we can talk about the hair that 's sprouting From your shoulders , your nose , and your , ears ! Or , you know , you could just tell me about the prison suicides . Well , let 's go with the suicides . Inventory ! What a bone . Tycho Brahe 's snot pocket . Check . This place is falling apart . Oh , Venus de Milo 's arms . Rad . Okay , you know what I cannot work under these conditions . - What you doin ' ? - Rebuilding a carburetor . That 's funny . I mean , what 's the tune ? Something I 've been working on for my father . Whoa . How old is your father ? No , I mean , that 's really good for you . Can I have the keys to the cherry picker ? Why ? and no , you can 't . I just want to fix this lightbulb . It 's flickering . It 's really annoying . Just let it go , Claudia . You know , it 's just gonna burn out , And you 'll have me fixing it later . Okay , here 's the thing , you know , these bulbs , they never burn out , they 're Shelby bulbs . They were invented by Adolphe Chaillet 108 years ago . So there 's no need ... What am I doing even talking to you ? I am busy . I ... I will tighten the bulb later . Artie ! Fine . Riverton Penitentiary , Florida I know you have a corner on the whole vibe thing , But this place is creepy . Well , maybe it just needs a woman 's touch . Agents Bering and Lattimer . Sorry to keep you waiting . There 's a tropical storm headed this way , And the preparations are endless . I 'm Corinne Huggins , the warden . I 'm not sure what the Secret Service 's interest is In all this , but I expect to be kept in the loop . - Of course . - Good . This way . Riverton hadn 't had a suicide in two years . Now , including Donaldson , We 've had four in the past month . His parole had just come through , right ? He had reconciled with his wife , And he was looking forward to being with his family . Not a very high risk for suicide . None of them were . All four were model prisoners . Had anything new been brought in Before the first suicide , furniture , artwork ? Agent Lattimer , this is a maximum-security facility , Not a college dormitory . There 's been nothing new . No woman 's touch . Right . Of course . What about new inmates ? There 's been a freeze on intake . We 've been operating over-capacity since before I took over . - When was that ? - Just over a month ago . Just before the first suicide . I bet she 's got some demonic tchotchke on her desk That she uses as a paperweight . Okay , I take back the " woman 's touch " comment . My predecessor had been here quite a few years . There hasn 't been much time to look at paint chips . You killed me , killed me , Bunny . As it is , we 've had to store his things in the anteroom closet Until his estate is out of probate . Myka ? Okay , this prisoner Donaldson didn 't leave a suicide note . Mind if I look through his stuff ? You killed me , bunny ... These are his personal effects . Coo-ell ! Love that . - Ouroboros . - Huh ? It 's a snake . It 's a symbol of self-reflection and cyclicity . And the best Rush album since Roll the Bones . Snakes and arrows rocks . Written by one of our inmates . His path to salvation . Creepy . Who 's John Hill ? Though we 're surrounded by concrete and razor wire , I can show you more freedom than the men who hold the keys . What 's he in for ? He killed his wife . A lot . Darkness has descended on this house . Death has returned to Riverton . And those who do not learn from history Are doomed to repeat it . Dr. Cooper 's ready for y 'all . Regret has no place in your life . Your only salvation is here . Artie , if you won 't let me use the cherry picker , then how am I Warehouse 13 S01E10 Alessandro Volta 's Lab Coat Temporarily increases biomagnetic attraction No way . What every fashionable girl is wearing this fall . Oh , awesome ! Suck it , magneto ! Sweet . I can totally see my house from here . Okay ... this is mildly disconcerting . Great . Now we know they last 108 years . Do you think freaky cult leader are born with crazy eyes , Or is it some sort of corrective surgery ? Pete , what is it ? - You don 't see that ? - See what ? That guy standing there . It 's my dad . Uh , so , uh , Pete saw his father , but you didn 't , right ? Yeah. but I should probably mention that I saw Sam earlier . What ? Why didn 't you say anything ? Well , you know , Sam 's dead . And your father 's dead . I mean , you can understand my reticence , right ? You 're both hallucinating ? And when were you gonna mention that to me ? Well , we just did . What ... what was that ? Tropical storminez . Uh , you didn 't say that there was a storm . Why is that important ? How many times do I have to tell you about electrical energy ? It can crank up the intensity of an artifact , I don 't know , tenfold . And if an artifact is causing these hallucinations , Then a powerful electrical charge can make these visions seem absolutely real . Well , they seem pretty real now . All right , then listen . You 're gonna have to stay in constant contact ... you got that ? Constant . And I don 't care if you have nothing to report , Every hour you 're gonna call me , all right ? And meanwhile you 're gonna find out everything Everything about these inmates who killed themselves . Start with the last one , Lee Donaldson . According to your statement , Lee said something before he jumped . " I have to get away from her . " That 's what he said . I can only think he meant Claire . That 's the girl he killed in the hit and run , right ? He quit drinking , but never forgave himself for taking a life . Guilt 's a powerful thing . He was your trustee , right ? More than that . We were friends . I 'm trained in recognizing the warning signs . I don 't know why I didn 't see them . Did Lee have any enemies ? John Hill . Riverton 's self-proclaimed messiah , Leading his personal religious cult . Lee was an early convert , But after Hill started capitalizing on the suicides , Lee saw what he really was An opportunist preying on fear . Lee got out , and Hill didn 't like losing one of his lambs . Hill may have strange religious beliefs , But he 's harmless . I don 't particularly like what he has to say , But you can 't deny the calming effect it 's had on some of the inmates . How are we today , Mr. Hill ? Another day above ground , warden . Another day above ground . Indeed . These are agents Bering and Lattimer . They 'd like to ask you some questions . I 'll be in my office . Where 'd you get that necklace ? Well , you could say it 's ... it 's always been with me . Or you could say where you got it . The object itself is of no importance . Its value lies in what it represents . And what is that ? Some demand that we consume ourselves with remorse for our supposed sin . Ouroboros reminds us to transcend the cycle And walk the path to enlightenment . No remorse , huh ? What about the path to parole ? I was and am his instrument on earth . And with my hands , it is his will And not mine that is done . To feel remorse ... is to shame god . What about those who are remorseful ? Like Donaldson . Lee 's death revealed his greater purpose . Man cannot be saved without sacrifice . Ooh , I see . Oh , that 's a neat trick , huh ? Now you get to tell your boys You can protect them from sacrifice , like Donaldson . My followers are free Because they know the way to freedom . You killed me , killed me , bunny . The cruelest prison is the one That we build for ourselves out of fear and regret . Sam ? This isn 't real . This can 't ... be real . Sam again ? Yeah . I can 't ... move ! Okay , no need to panic . Just take off the coat . Can 't take off the coat . Okay , new plan . Oh , I 'm so getting grounded . Incoming ! Better you than me . Artie ! This is the last one . What is it you 're looking for ? - I 'm not sure . Uh , anomalies , patterns . - Riots . That 's a little specific , but sure . No , no , look . For decades , Riverton was known as the snake pit . Dozens of inmates went insane here . Then , in 1979 , during Hurricane David , There were uncontrollable riots . I mean , the place almost burned down . Six months later it was closed . Reopened a year later under warden Matthews . He was here until he died last month . So what did he do differently ? Warden ? Are you okay ? I beg your pardon . The week is catching up with me . I was just asking what Matthews did differently To whip this place into shape . Well , he was very religious . He instituted daily prayers . He swore it turned the place around . That 's him . Hey , hey , hey . This looks familiar . Check out what he got rid of when he moved in . And no more riots . He wasn 't a very tolerant man . Anything he thought was pagan he had taken out . Well , let 's go see the good reverend . Good-bye snakes and arrows . And that should take care of that . Warden , I had your permission to wear that . I 'm not sure I understand . what , exactly , is the danger ? I 'm sorry , We can 't disclose that information . I was quite clear , you get free reign of my institution , I get some answers . Please don 't misconstrue our silence as disrespect . It 's just beyond our authority to tell you . Yeah , but I 'm pretty sure There won 't be any more suicides . Cause of death , brain hemorrhage Due to blunt-force trauma . Final report to come . You could have helped me , doctor . Lee , I 'm sorry . I tried ... I did . I thought you were my friend . You ignored the warning signs . You let me die , doctor ! Stop ... Lee ! Lee , I--I 'm your friend ! I tried You killed me , doctor . Listen to me ! You told me the suicides would stop . Now we have another one . Clearly you 're not able to help . And you 're not being truthful with me about what 's going on . I promise you , warden , We have told you everything that we know . Oh , really ? And what , exactly , are you looking for ? Well , it could be anything . Look , sometimes freaky stuff causes other freaky stuff to happen . After the storm passes , I expect you two to be gone . I 'm gonna request a federal team of investigators . Okay , so he was here alone , And he was depressed about Donaldson . Medical examiners record their autopsy findings . Maybe he has a recorder around here somewhere . Right . So the ... so look ... look for one . Fine . I 'll do it . I 'm over here . I 'll do it . I 'll do it . God ... sorry , I just want to look here . Hey , Myka . Okay , play it . Lee , I 'm sorry . I tried , I did . Lee , I 'm sorry . You are my friend ! Okay , okay , so now he 's talking to the dead guy . But he should know better . He 's a doctor . What 's that static sound ? - Did you hear that ? - Yeah . - Play it again . - Okay . Lee , I 'm sorry . I tried , I did . Lee , I 'm sorry . You are my friend ! - Did you hear that ? - Yeah . It sounded like bad cell phone service . It 's 10 thousand cycles per second . It could be the electrical interference That any natural material makes when it vibrates . Okay , so where does it come from ? Well , any number of minerals or heavy metals Or it can be an artifact that contains both . Well , just give me a second . Just one ... ah . - Does that sound familiar ? - That 's it . So , Artie , We 're looking for some kind of a mineral artifact that causes hallucinations . Is that banging ? Do you hear ? Yeah , no , you do that . You do that , but I ... - Artie ? Hello ? What ... - No , I 'm okay , I 'm okay . I just ... You know what , Artie , we got it . Thanks . We 'll call you later . Yeah , all right . S ... O ... S-O-S ? Claudia ! Artie ! Oh , hi , Artie . Hi . Huh , funny story . So I kind of , uh , tried to fix this lightbulb , Even though you expressly told me not to . And man , have I learned my lesson ! You 're so right about this place . You just never know what to expect . Okay , you 're pissed . Can we move past that part for now ? And get to the part where you get me down from here ? That wouldn 't be Volta 's lab coat that you 're wearing ? All part of the hilarious story I should really tell you when I 'm back on planet earth . The reason , Claudia that volta 's lab coat is in the warehouse Is because Volta couldn 't control its magnetic field . As you may have noticed , Each metallic object that it connects to makes the coat stronger and stronger . That explains so much . Thank you . My glasses ! Those better not be scratched ! You know , when I was in girl scouts , We would make these little mini metal detectors So we could hunt for gold . Most speakers are coated with a polymer film that picks up VHF frequencies . But we never found any gold . But we did find a lot of worthless minerals . Are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah . I ... I want you to know that you can tell me things . I ... I got the report about Denver . What 'd it say ? I don 't know . I ... didn 't read it . Intellectually , I know I did everything by the book . Of course you did . You 're you . What if I missed something , Pete ? What if it 's my fault ? Myka , the only person responsible for Sam 's death Is the piece of garbage that pulled the trigger that day . You protected the president . That 's the gig . You 're a hero , and so is Sam . Okay ? - Yeah . - Okay ? That 's a cool-ass science project . Yeah , it 's ... You know , it 's ... It 's not working . Sounds like it 's working . No , it 's ... it 's not . It 's just crackling at everything . Well , maybe there 's minerals everywhere . Look , how can there be minerals . The miners ' mine . They are everywhere , including in the ground . Come on . Thank you . I 'm sorry about the ... Look . Quartz mines . Quartz . Do you see ? This building was built on an old quartz mine . And back then , indigenous materials Would have been used when building a new structure . Quartz , as in the mineral ? As in hallucination inducer . As in this whole freaking structure is one giant tuning fork . And mother nature 's just banging away . Okay , now , I 've got these magnets . They 're attached to this thing . When I let go , they 're coming right at you . They 'll stick to you and the stuff near you . Okay , here they come . Okay , they 're on . Would it have killed you to put a warning label on these things And say what ? " Only put on in case of stupid " ? Oh , just bottom line this for me , Artie . - Worst-case scenario ? - Oh , why not ? The entire warehouse buckles in on itself , Crushing us both to death . Okay , yeah , I changed my mind . Sugarcoat it . Okay , it must be the storm Because I can 't get any reception . Okay , so the whole building is causing the hallucinations , right ? Right . So maybe we should start thinking about what stopped them for 30 years . Okay , so the prison opens . - Right . - There 's a hurricane . Suddenly there 's a ton of violence . The prison closes. it reopens with a new warden , And suddenly the violence stops . Right . He dies . His stuff goes into storage . The suicides start . I don 't know Maybe the old bible banger had something that was curing the crazy . Right . Maybe this is what Mrs. Frederic meant By " endless freaking wonder . " - Let 's go . - Yeah , let 's get out of here . - Cause they 're not there . - We did not see that . - Warden ? Warden Huggins ? - No ! Warden , what 's going on ? it 's locked . - Have you got the keys ? - Stop . Stop . I 'm sorry ! Okay , he cuckoo for cocoa puffs . Warden Huggins , it 's agent Bering . Are you all right ? Get back , Dr. Cooper ! That 's not true . Look out . Let me bust the door down . But it 's ... it 's ... It 's a warden 's door . It 's probably sturdier than most . I wish you would 've said that about five seconds ago . No , no ! get away from me ! That 's not a good sign . We have to go through the ex-warden 's stuff in storage . You can 't get this out , Corinne . You can never control this prison . How many the born of the die when you are in I mean , how much " world 's greatest warden " crap can you have ? We don 't even know what we 're looking for . Why would this time be any different ? Okay , look . Give me the Farnsworth . I 'm gonna try Artie again . It appears that Riverton is now the land of the blind . And we are its one-eyed kings . Just a minute . Yeah ? Artie ! Artie , thank god . Okay , what shuts down quartz ? Of course , it 's quartz . it 's quartz , right . Yeah , that makes perfect sense . I should have . Artie ... Yeah , yeah , yeah . Okay , listen . Pierre Curie and his brother Jacques , They proved the existence of a converse effect of piezoelectricity . You know what that is , don 't you ? - Yeah . - Yeah . So what you 've gotta do is you ... Help ! artie . Yeah , sorry . Okay , the frequency of a piece of quartz Can be completely cancelled out by its proximity to a second piece of quartz . Now , the second piece is probably what the artifact I 'm having a little ... With the image breaking up . It 's a large piece , okay ? ... Parts of ... Is the storm ... worse ? A lot . When you find the artifact , You gotta put it exac ... Exactly ... before Be ... proxim ... the original frequency Essential ... Artie . Artie ! Okay , big piece of quartz in the closet . Hey , hello . Can we get back to me , Artie ? There 's a bicycle on me . We 're gonna have to reduce the magnetic field . But we 're gonna do it very gradually . We have to do that just because We wouldn 't want to destroy your central nervous system . No . No , we wouldn 't . We would not . Hey , what is that ? That sounds bad . What is that ? Artie ! Artie ? Box of crap . Box of crap . Warden , whatever you 're seeing , it 's not real . You 're perfectly safe . It 's the cross . Claudia , new plan . But listen , you have to do exactly ... Exactly as I say . Got that ? You 're the man . Stay right there . What ? - Bingo ! - You found it ? What is it that they say about those who live by the sword . Stand aside , please . Is that some sort of prison term for " you 're a dead woman " ? I can 't take the door off its hinges if you 're standing in front of it . You really think we 're just gonna let you in there ? If the prison is in an uproar , That means the warden is in trouble . She 's always supported my work . I would like to help . Wait ! Target has arrived . Repeat , target has arrived . Sam ? Sam ? It 's happening again . You should have warned me , Petey . Dad ? If you knew I was never coming home , Why didn 't you say something ? Repeat , target is on the move . Let 's move in . Negative . Negative . The plan is to extract at the stairs . Sam , wait ! I was a kid . It was just a feeling . I was afraid . Well , it 's time to be a man , Take responsibility for your actions , Your fears , your regrets . It 's your fault . You were late . Was I ? You killed me , bunny . Now you 've gotta make it right . It 's time to pay the price , boy . The cruelest prison is the one We build for ourselves out of fear and regret . What ? Not a day goes by that I don 't miss you . But you would have gone to work that morning Whether I would have warned you or not . - And I have no more regret ... - " Regret ... " About not stopping you . - And I have no more fear ... - " Out of fear ... " That I did the wrong thing . " Regret has no place in your life . " It wasn 't my fault . It 's just it 's who you were , And who I try and be every day of my life . " The cruelest prison is the one " " That we build for ourselves ... " Stay away from me , Sam ! Myka . Listen to me . You can fight this . Okey ? You know what happened in Denver Their planing in preparations wasn 't enough . You know the truth Don 't be afraid of it . This is the report . Remeber ? You know what is in it . Don 't be afraid . Sam said I killed him . You know that 's not the truth . Myka listen , you don 't need the report to tell you What is already know in your heart . You did everything right . Sam didn 't listened to you . That is why he is dead . He screwed up . Not you . Do you understand ? Then tell Sam the truth . I am sorry Sam . Sam is not gonna bring me back bunny . I 'm sorry because you made the mistake . Not me . You were late . No . No . You were early . They targeted me too when you got yourself killed . I love you . Sam . I always will . But I have to move on . I have to move on . - You are okay ? - Getting worse . Yeah . - What we gonna do with this ? - Ok . The picture ... the picture in the old warden are So it was ... there . Hurry , Artie . Good idea . What 's that , it sounds like a truck . No , it 's not truck . All right . It 's a truck . Wait , wait . Come on , come on . Hang on . Hey what was that for ? Get rid of the body ? No . The back up plan doesn 't work . What do you mean by " doesn 't work " ? I don 't think I 'm gonna like this . Now , go . Heavens got me . Oh , Artie , don 't do this . No , please . Artie . Oh , god , I don 't hope to get shoot , please.Don 't because of this . Just don 't move . Ok . I promise I 'll be good from now on . Grab it . Ok , I 'm trying . Ultimas maximums . That was awesome ! Yeah , it kinda was awesome , wasn 't it ?

I hope you like cross . Pete ! Oh , my god . Help me . What happened ? Okay , okay , he 's losing a lot of blood . - We gotta get him out of here . - No , no , no , no . It 's all right . He 's chosen me for sacrifice . I 'm ... on ... a new path . How many times do I have to write this , Artie ? Okay . All right , Claudia . All right . Okay . You know what ... - No . - Yeah . Enough of doing it that way . All right , so ... Now , Claudia ... Okay ... Now , focus . Don 't just write it . Believe it . - No ... - Yes . I will not disobay Arite . How long you been working on that ? Since I lost my father . Artie , I 'm sorry . When did he die ? Oh , he 's alive . I just hope that finishing this Will help us find each other again . Myka .

 NARRATOR : Previously on Heroes . ( GASPS ) Daphne ! This woman is dying . I need to get her to an emergency room . I can 't do anything to help her here . I don 't want you to help her . ( HEART MONITOR FLATLINING ) I got another assignment for you . AGENT : I want the perimeter locked down . A team , rip apart the rectory . All clear . I slept and I had a dream . I know what we have to do now . We need to go find Nathan and Claire . We need to bring this family together . And they 're coming for Little Matt . We were sent to help . AGENT : Janice Parkman ? We have a warrant to bring you and your child in for questioning . ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) We should pool our resources . DANKO : You desperately want to find Martin so you can get that ability , don 't you ? Shape-shifting . You 're salivating . It 'll be a lot easier for us to operate if everybody thinks I 'm dead . DANKO : No pulse . No body temp . Believe it . Sylar 's dead . Impressive work . I never did catch how you pulled it off . Four-inch pocket blade , replaced by a six-inch metal spike . Metal 's a good choice . Last time it was glass . Killed him just fine , till it melted in the Primatech fire . Trust me , he won 't be getting up again . I 've been chasing this one for a long time . It 's a funny thing . You 're on the hunt all these years , then I show up , and bang , he 's dead . Maybe you didn 't really want to catch him . Or maybe you 're just better at this than me . Bennet , you have a visitor downstairs . Says she 's your wife . My wife is here ? Send her up . OPERATOR : You have reached a number that has been disconnected and is no longer in service . ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( CRYING ) ( COOING ) ( CAR STOPPING ) I 've arranged travel to India . If it 's safe , I 'll get what I can from the apartment and leave by ship from New York . Avoid the airports . Smart . Washington 's far too dangerous for us . You should come with me . No , I 'm not going anywhere . Matt ? Matt , I know how you feel about Daphne , and what they did to her was inhuman , but this is ... What they did to Daphne was protocol . She died because she was different . ( SIGHS ) I can 't get over it , Mohinder . I can 't get it out of my head . These agents , they 're too powerful . We tried to stop it before . We went after the wrong guy . Emile Danko . He 's been pushing this whole thing . That bastard killed Daphne , just as sure as he pulled the trigger himself . So it 's revenge ? You just want to see him die ? I want him hurt . I want him to feel what he 's done . Matt , please , let 's just talk about this . You 've been a really good friend , Mohinder . Goodbye , Mohinder . ( DOOR OPENING ) Sandra . What are you doing here ? I am not gonna sit home any longer , Noah . Agents burst into our house , our daughter goes missing and you ignore my phone calls . That 's not fair . I have returned all of your calls . And told me nothing . I know when I 'm being handled , Noah . Claire is safe . You know how this works . The less you know , the better . That 's not good enough . I can 't believe a word you say and I want to see my daughter . I 'm sorry , am I interrupting your busy day ? There 's a body inside . They 're telling me that it 's Sylar , but ... I don 't know . Something just doesn 't feel right . Will you listen to yourself ? Claire has disappeared and you 're talking to me about Sylar . You must be Mrs. Bennet . I 've seen your picture . I 'll bet you have . From the surveillance cameras watching my house . Nice meeting you . Sandra . Please , go back to Costa Verde . I am staying at the Regency . And I am not leaving until you find her . It 's fun being you . Commanding the respect of others . What the hell are you doing ? But you really ought to have that mole checked . You know the one I mean . I showed Bennet the body . You should have seen his face . Do you know how dangerous this is ? This isn 't a game . It 's not about you finding some clever way to kill Noah Bennet . I 'm not gonna kill him . I 'm gonna destroy him . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) This is Bennet . Noah . Angela . I 've been worried about you . I 've had a dream . Do you know about what happened at the place called Coyote Sands ? I 've heard whispers , rumors . For 20 years , anyone I ever asked always told me the same thing . Which is ? That I should never ask again . Peter and I are headed there now . I spoke with Nathan . He and Claire will meet us . I need you with us . It 's time everyone knew the truth . I just have a few loose ends to tie up . They showed me a body . Our old friend , with a six-inch spike in his skull . Sylar ? So they tell me . There 's only one way to be sure . No , leave it alone , Noah . Get out while you can . Where 'd they take the bodies ? Crematorium . Barbecue day . Noah , leave it . Are you listening to me ? Leave it alone . Leave . Noah ! Noah . Noah ! Someone 's gonna have to pay for that . Who took my papers ? My father 's work ? They said they were from Homeland Security . Also told me that if you or the big guy showed up , I should give them a call . Yeah , I 'd advise against it . I might have to implicate you . I checked the building before I came up . No one 's watching . ( SIGHS ) Those guys must have got what they wanted . First the Feds , now you . I don 't need this in my life . Don 't worry . I 'll be gone tomorrow . I don 't believe this . Oh , and your crazy old man , he left some stuff in storage downstairs . Do me a favor . When you go , take it with you ? Show me . ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( TRUCK HONKING ) Whoa , don 't go getting all foreign on me . Y 'all are from the mothership , huh ? Uh , hablo a little ingleso ? SÃ­ . I am Hiro , this is Ando , and this is Baby Matt Parkman . Well , climb aboard , amigos . Name 's Sam Douglas from Lubbock , Texas . Car trouble , huh ? Yes . We are trying to get to the East Coast to find the baby 's father . Well , I got me a buddy mechanic in the next town . He can get you all fixed up . Oh , that 's fantastic . Thank you . No problemo . Well ... Let 's rodeo ! ( CRYING ) ( ENGINE STALLING ) Hey . Everything 's shutting down . Ignition , electrical . Even my CB went out . ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SCREECHING ) Something 's not right . That 's it , Emile , feel it . Feel it . It 's a hell of a thing , not knowing who you can trust . That 's it , feel it . The person closest to you is in danger . Go to them . Make sure they 're okay . Wait . Stop . Don 't move that body . Mr. Bennet , can I help you ? Draw your weapons . Sir ? Get a bead on the back of his head . Do it ! Mr. Bennet ? Quiet . Okay , I need this sent to Strathmore Labs . I need a DNA analysis . This is an A1 priority . You got it ? Sure . You want us to go ahead and cremate the body ? No . I have a signed order to cremate the body . Mr. Bennet ? Who are you ? Alena . ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) Is everything all right ? ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) ( MR. BENNET SIGHING ) MR. BENNET : Sandra , hi . Come on in . So this is your new home . Well , you said it couldn 't wait , so I assume you want to know about Claire . No , Claire is fine . She called about half an hour ago . I just need you to sign these . What is it ? It would be easier if you just signed . Divorce ? This is the real reason you came all the way to Washington , was to serve me ? What does it say ? That you have perpetually lied to me , brought loaded guns into the home , endangered the lives of our children . Sandra ... I already changed the locks . Noah , just sign the damn papers . Sandra , don 't throw away 22 years of marriage . Marriage . Is that what you call this ? This isn 't a marriage , it 's an arrangement . It 's cover , so you can go around shooting at people . All right , look . I 'll be done with my work here soon . I will come back to California . Don 't insult me with promises . We will go to counseling . It 's too late . We owe it to Lyle and to Claire , to try to hold this family together . You 're not listening . It 's too late . I don 't love you anymore . You 're a liar and a betrayer . You say you care about your family . You don 't . It 's over , Noah . I don 't love you . I don 't trust you . I don 't even respect you . And when that 's gone ... ( CRYING ) Look , I 'm sorry for all y 'all 's troubles , but what say we try moving your magic baby the hell away from my truck ? Well , I still got a load to deliver . Thank you for the ride . Good luck to you . Come on , Baby Matt Parkman , please ? Look , I make a funny face for you . Come on , Baby Matt . Look at Uncle Ando . ( EXCLAIMING ) ( WAILS ) ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( ENGINE STARTING ) ( CRYING ) ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) In English , Alena . You promised you 'd practice . For you , Jakob . But only you . Do you really have to leave so soon ? I told you , this was all last-minute . I have to fly back to Chicago tonight . I know , I know . A mix-up at the warehouse . ( CAR HONKING ) Car 's here . I gotta go . Hey , give me a smile . I 'll be back in Washington before you know it . ( GASPS ) Who are you ? How did you get in here ? Uh , the door ... I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . This was a bad idea . I don 't believe it . They sent you to me , didn 't they ? Sent me ? The escort service . They gave you my address , right ? I told them I was finished . No more . But they never listen . So the guy who was just here was a client ? Mr. Prodasa ? Mr. Prodasa . How do you know about Jakob ? Jakob and I work together . He asked me to meet him here . You 're from his work ? Yeah . I 've never met any of his friends . But now that I have you , I insist . Please sit . ( SIGHS ) ( SIGHING ) Strathmore Labs , this is Nigel . This is Noah Bennet . I 'm awaiting results of a DNA sample I sent earlier today . Uh , yes , Mr. Bennet . I was just e-mailing you now . The DNA matches one James Martin of Arlington , Virginia . Martin . Thank you . Sylar 's a shape-shifter . Have you been seeing Jakob a while now ? Almost a year . Jakob and I met through the ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) He ever talk to you about his work ? A bit . Schoolbooks . He says his company sells all over the world . It sounds boring , actually . Yeah . Well , his sales calls do keep him on the move . That and his family . He talks to you about his family ? His wife , two boys , yes . He told me about them right away . He is going home to Chicago to be with them , but he promised , once his children are grown , that ... You were gonna be together , yeah . After what I have been through , it is a miracle to have someone like Jakob come into your life . He loves me . You know what ? The sick thing is , he probably does . But he does not deserve you . Whatever you think he is , it 's a lie , Alena , a lie . And you need to get away from him , now , while you still can . No . You are scaring me . Who are you , really ? You want me to tell you all about Jakob ? I 'm gonna show you . Hello ? Dr. Suresh ? This is Hiro Nakamura . Yes , I know . My very angry landlord said you 'd been calling all day . Yes . It is important that we find Matt Parkman . Do you know where he is ? Still in Washington , I 'm afraid . I did what I could , but ... ( SIGHING ) Hiro , Matt 's changed . He 's committed himself to a very destructive course . What ? We must save him . Believe me , I tried . But it 's difficult to dissuade a man who 's decided he has nothing to live for . I 'll tell you the place where Matt was last headed . Suresh ? ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Thank you , Dr. Suresh . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( ENGINE STALLING ) ( BABY CRYING ) What 's it called again ? Coyote Sands . There it is . That 's like a million miles from nowhere . Why do we have to meet her there ? I have no idea . But when your grandmother has a dream , it 's a good idea to pay attention . It appears my father was looking for information on an abandoned government project in the 1960s , focusing on an Operation Icarus . The files are heavily redacted , but it mentions medical research at a place called Coyote Sands . My father was there . ( GUN COCKS ) There 's cash in my purse . MR. BENNET : I 'm not here for your money . Noah ? You say another word and you die . Noah , what are you doing ? Divorce papers ? Nice . Did you really think I wouldn 't notice that your signature doesn 't match ? What are you talking about ? Sandra never even left California , did she ? Noah , it 's me . It 's Sandra , I 'm your ... Shut up ! I know who you are . ( STAMMERING ) Your mother 's name is Anita , we honeymooned in Puerto Vallarta ... You 've done your homework . You sleep on your left side . Your joints ache ... You can mind-read now ? What ? Who did you kill ? Matt Parkman ? I didn 't kill anyone . Danko 's in on it , isn 't he ? He was going after James Martin . Did he feed you his catch ? Noah . Answer me . Is Danko in on it ? I don 't know what you 're talking about ! Noah , please . The kids . Don 't do this . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Where 's your phone ? Where is it ? In my coat pocket . Hello . LYLE : Dad ? Lyle , what do you need ? Um , I 'm supposed to give Muggles some kind of pill while Mom 's away . I forgot where she keeps the pills . Where are Muggles ' pills ? I don 't know . Top shelf of the refrigerator , on the left . Not the green bottle , the brown one . Top shelf of the fridge , on the left . The green bottle or the brown one ? Brown . Get out . Sylar 's a shape-shifter . Leave . He came to me as you . You filed for divorce , you changed the locks . Probably a good idea . No , Sandra . Don 't you understand ? This is exactly what he wants . Get out ! You gotta believe me . I do believe you , Noah . But it doesn 't matter . It 's too late . I really want you to leave . Now . ( DOOR LOCKING ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Alena ? What are you doing here ? I don 't understand . You live here ? Damn it , Alena . I 'm not gonna ask you again . How did you find me ? I brought her here . Parkman . What the hell did you do to her ? Inside . Both of you . ( EXCLAIMING ) Don 't even think about it . Even if this place is bugged , your soldiers won 't get here in time . So this is what you 've been reduced to ? What kind of garbage did you push into her head to get her to come along ? It didn 't take much , Danko . Danko ? Why does he call you that ? And this place . You said you lived in Chicago with your family . Stop , Alena . Don 't listen to him . He 'll work you . Make you believe things that aren 't real . What 's the matter , Emile ? What , are you worried she 's not gonna roll out the red carpet when she finds out what her boyfriend really does for a living ? Shove the psycho-babble , Parkman . You have no idea who I am . I used to be a cop . I was surrounded by basketcases like you . Your job 's a nightmare , so you seek out anything to ease the pain . Nothing relationships , fantasies of a normal life . Trust me , I 've been there . Go to hell . Your boyfriend kills people for a living . Jakob , tell me you are not this person . Go ahead , Danko . Tell her . My name isn 't Jakob . There is no family in Chicago , no house . I 'm a soldier . I hunt people for the government . Son of a bitch . Tell her what you did to the woman I loved . All of it . The woman , Millbrook ... Daphne . She was a threat . You killed her ? No , it 's worse than that . He had a choice and he let her die . You were everything to me , Jakob . Why did you lie ? Because I knew you couldn 't possibly love someone who did these things . You really care about her , don 't you ? This is the only way that you 're gonna truly understand what you did to me . Go ahead , Parkman . But if you think killing her is gonna make a difference , or change how I feel about the program , forget it . Whatever you do , nothing 's ever gonna be more important to me than putting you and your friends down . ( SOBS ) My God , Jakob . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . This is what he 's done to us . In his world , there is no room for mercy . Jakob , no ! Go ahead . Finish it . Oh , close one . Parkman ! Alena . Monster . Stay away from me . What is it , Bennet ? Guess again . I went to Bennet 's apartment and told his doorman that I forgot my key . Bennet 's old Primatech files . Looks like he 's been holding out on you . I 'm not surprised . No ? Are you surprised now ? If I were Sylar , I wouldn 't need this , now would I ? Gun . I knew he couldn 't have gotten to James Martin alone , not right under your nose . What do you want ? How dumb are you ? How did you think it was gonna end ? Who did you think would be left standing the minute Sylar got bored ? You ? What do you want ? I want Sylar on a platter . And then , maybe , I 'll overlook this pathetic little cry for help . He 's been going on assignment as Agent Donner , leader of Team 6 . They 've been racking up a lot of wins lately . Where are they now ? On a mission . They should be back in an hour . I 'll wait . And so will you . I know you meant well , Hiro , but I didn 't ask to be rescued . Dr. Suresh told us about your plan . It is one thing to defend yourself , but a true warrior knows the difference between a righteous battle ... And what ? Retribution ? See , that 's where you 're wrong . It 's the only thing the other side understands . But that is why we are better than them . That is why we had to save you . Matt ! Finally . What 's going on ? I cannot make the face anymore . What 's with the kid ? Matt Parkman , meet Matt Parkman . He is your son . Wait . My son ? We rescued him from government agents in California . He has a power like us . This is why you can 't give up . A boy needs his father . I have a son ? Hi . I have a son . Hey . ( CHUCKLES ) Outstanding . Great work out there . Wade , good job . Sir . Agent Donner . Yes , sir . A word , please . Did I do something wrong ? Just wanted to say congrats . You guys have really been on a roll lately . Thank you , sir . This man is not Donner , he 's Sylar . He has shape-shifting abilities . Get a lock on the back of his head . Whoa , whoa , guys , it 's just me . Tell him , Danko . I have no idea what you 're talking about . Agent Danko has betrayed you . He and Sylar are working against you . Guys , this is a huge mistake . Put the gun down , Bennet . This is Sylar . He 's killed a dozen agents , and Danko is protecting him . Everybody stand down . Look , you 're under a lot of stress . Yeah , because of the divorce and everything . How would you know a thing like that ? Everybody , freeze ! This is Sylar , and I can prove it . He 's gonna heal , you watch . Get up . Get up . Get up . Get up ! He 's dead . Sylar was never even in the building . You just killed an innocent man . Nobody moves . Put your weapons on the ground , right now . Weapons down , or I will blow his head off ! Get him ! I didn 't have a lot of options . I had to direct him somewhere . It seemed the safest choice . ( GRUNTS ) You almost got me killed . You could have said I was Agent Foster . Except if Bennet shot Foster , Foster would be dead . Didn 't know you could bleed like that . I squeezed a little extra for show . Sandra , I just called to say ... I don 't know what . I love you , miss you . I miss my family . All my old numbers are burned . I can 't leave you this one . I 'll call you again when it 's safe . ( SPEAKING BABY TALK ) Alena , it 's me . I know how you must feel . Betrayed . Angry . But what I said before , it 's not true . You mean so much to me . The way I am with you ... It 's not a lie . Jakob Prodasa is ... Is the man I want to be . I can 't do it without you . I 'm begging you . Please . Give me a chance to prove myself . You know , I still don 't understand what we 're doing out here , Mom . This is the place , Peter . This is where our story really begins . Yeah . Why did you call him here ? This family has to come together . Whatever has happened , Nathan is still your brother . Yeah , well , I have a hard time believing that . Peter . Claire , it 's all right . Let him vent . Enough . There 's been too much misery in this place . What happened here , Ma ? Why 'd you call us together ? I never wanted you to see this . Any of you . But I realize now that was a mistake , and to prepare for the future , you have to understand the past . You want the answers ? Then you 'll have to dig . MOHINDER : It is our nature to protect our children , for each generation to pass on their cautionary tales to the next . So it is with the myth of Icarus . The legend of a boy who fashioned wings from feathers and wax , daring to fly into the heavens . His father was fearful , and warned Icarus to be careful . PETER : You find something ? Begging him not to tempt fate by flying too close to the sun . But in the end , the boy couldn 't resist . His waxen wings melted from the sun 's rays . ( EXCLAIMING ) Mom ? And he plunged to his death . You know who that was ? I knew all of them . All of them ? Exactly how many are here , Ma ? Keep digging .

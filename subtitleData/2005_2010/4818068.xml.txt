I know ... so you can stop crying . but ... ! Our house is all gone ! It can 't be helped ! This is so we can build a new town . N-New ... town ? A new town ... Basquash ! I 'm more Basquash than you ! Basquash ! Dummy ! Oh dear . You lost your home too ? What a pity . Follow me . of course Team Basquash is gonna win ! Moron ! King of Kings will never lose ! just a — ! Thatta boy ! How are we going to pay for milk for the baby ? These people came together because they have no place to go . I suppose . The lineup worked out pretty much as we predicted . The tickets are already sold out . too . The guys upstairs should be satisfied . But that 's not why we 're here . The time has come to find out his true worth — that 's why . who casts balls down like thunderbolts . Makes you look forward to tomorrow 's match . All right ! We are so gonna win tomorrow ! You are so deluding yourself . What ? It 's Idol Red . it 's pissing me off ! Learn my name ! Don 't wanna . I don 't see your pet anywhere ... he 's flat on his back over there . idiot . Just leave him . He 's plastered . Team Basquash " ... What 's wrong with " Team Spanky " ? ! what were you doing ? Staring at the billboard like that is creepy . Shut up ! did you see me up there and get entranced ? A-As if ! Of course not . I know ! I 'm just teasing . isn 't it ? Yup . but we ain 't going easy on you this time . fighting words . Of course . and I 'm gonna go to the moon . I 'm gonna dunk on the moon . What 's that mean ? That 's my dream . What 's so funny ? That 's good . It suits you . Wouldn 't mind trying that myself ... Dunking on the moon . what 's wrong ? It 's nothing . Thanks . What ? I ... It 's just ... when you don 't have a comeback it throws me off a little . Are you really okay — Ow ! I 'm okay ! I 'm fine . in front of everybody . we 'll show no mercy either . Because we 're playing for keeps . Of course . I got so excited . I never felt that way before . isn 't it awesome ? you start basquatting ... Basquatting ? that 's what I call it . It 's not that funny ! But ... ! That went " bekong " ! So how about here ? This goes " gong " ! over there ! This is surprisingly fun ! The sound 's totally different depending on where you hit it ! That went " bang " ! It 's about time for me to head back . I 'm looking forward to the match tomorrow . it 's Basquash . Basquash ! but we 're nothing like we were before ! This time we 're gonna win for sure . Eclipse will win . You tell youself that . Idol Red ! Don 't cry when you lose ! Bring it on ! head him off ! you smell of alcohol . I 'll smell of vomit pretty soon . You won 't get past ! like always . Looks like we 'll have a tough time again . the situation has changed . She 's right . Look at that ! Go Dunk Mask ! Destroy ! Oh Iceman ! of course we have fans ! Iceman ! Dunk Mask ! Sounds like fun ! You call that a feint ? how 's this ? Bye-bye ! Shit ! what are you doing ? Miss Rouge is incredible . and keeping one step ahead . I see . So Dan 's movements are an open book . She must have learned everything there was to learn about her opponents . it looks like those two are even breathing in sync ! Has Rouge gotten faster since the last time we played them ? Mr. Dan looks like he 's revelling in playing against her too . Watch out ! Mine ! What ? ! Gotcha ! You 're pretty good ! Get used to it ! I 'll stick to you no matter how far you go ! All right ! You ain 't seen no basquatting yet ! Can someone explain that to me ? He doesn 't even seem to see us here . Rouge is in great form today ! Those two flirting like that ... Anyone would think they 're lovers ! Dan JD ... don 't you think ? Not just Dan . Sela and Iceman are developing into extremely fine players themselves . Oh ? I 'd love to hear the secret to your coaching . Lying through your teeth . What 's wrong ? Had enough ? You 're moving like a robot ! I guess Bigfoots are sorta like robots . What 's happening ? Rouge isn 't moving at all ! Has there been an accident ? Miss Rouge ? Rouge ! Don 't tell me . Did you do something to that girl ? Hey . What is it ? I-I 'm sorry . I ... Jan ? right now we 're trying to trace the cause . or there 's a problem with the subject . Give me a response plan ASAP . We don 't have much time left . I know . These children have more work to do for us yet . Further OCB expansion is essential if we are to bring the legend to light . And Rouge is a valuable pawn to help us do that . we 're in crisis mode . We 're going to try further reinforcement on Rouge . keep it to yourself . We know it 's drastic . Guarantee of survival ? You 're kidding ! we should just create one ourselves . What ? They 're dropping out ? The commission sent out an official notice just a little while ago . is withdrawing . Team Basquash wins the semifinal match by default . So our next match is the finals ? our opponent will be King of Kings . where 's Dan ? Probably the bathroom . You sure ? Spanky took over the bathroom a while ago . What ? He has a hangover again ? Then Mr. Dan ... I know the places where Dan goes . He 's not there . I guess reading Mr. Dan 's movements like Rouge is — Rouge ! Dan ... ! Rouge ! We were so worried ! How do you feel ? Do you hurt anywhere ? You 're laying it on too thick . I 'm fine . Nothing to worry about now . More importantly ... Forgive me for making you lose . No . That 's not ... are you hiding anything from us ? You played without taking these beforehand ? Why ? I wanted to play as much as I could on my own strength . I don 't understand you at all ! You know how much we 've gone through to get this far ! Why do something so stupid — It was Dan . It was because you were playing Dan . Rouge ? Then ... for Dunk Mask you would really ... just once . I thought of how great it would be to just leap in and enjoy Basquash like that ... But I know now . I can 't even stay standing for the length of a match . And it was such an important one ... I 'm so sorry . Forgive us too . We never noticed how you felt ... I won 't forgive you . Citron ! got it ? We can 't help if we don 't know ! You 're such an idiot . Rouge . We 're your teammates . both of you . stupid-head ? Something wrong with being drunk ? ! I 'll never give up on Team Spanky ! Take that ! We 've been looking everywhere ! huh ? Citron . And Violette . they said asking this pet would be faster . Shut up ! I have a good nose ! Admit defeat ? ! So what do you want ? Rouge is going back to the moon ? tomorrow ... tonight . Why all of a sudden ? We 're out of time . Rouge 's body groans in pain . She pushed herself too hard . Once she gets to the moon they might put her straight into surgery . I-Is she sick ? That 's not it . The truth is ... We 've undergone special physical reinforcement so we can play Basquash . they messed with our bodies so we would win . But Rouge ... she didn 't take the drugs that the reinforcement requires . She said she didn 't want to lie to you any more than already has . Rouge wanted to see you before she left . Because she might never see you again . Dumbass ! Dumbass ! Rouge ! Rouge ! Rouge ! Rouge ! Rouge ! Rouge ! Rouge ! Why don 't you rest a while ? Isn 't it awesome ? you start basquatting ... That went " bekong " ! This goes " gong " ! What ... ? This melody ... ! Rouge ! Dan ... can 't she ? Yes . Dan 's message ! Mr. Dan really is incredible ! Basquash ! Dan . I 'll be waiting ... I 'll be waiting on the moon ! Rouge . I 'm gonna win the finals tomorrow . I 'm going to the moon ! Just you wait ! Our opponent in the finals is King of Kings ! We can 't afford to lose this match . and how each of us feels it ... Crash !

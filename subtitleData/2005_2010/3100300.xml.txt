 My name is Detective Brett Hopper And this is the day that changes everything ... Freeze ! Your hands up ! You 're under arrest for the murder of assistant DA Alberto Garza . I will be framed for murder ... Who the hell are you people ? My girlfriend Rita will be in danger . I know all this because I am living the same day , over and over again . The day is the same , but different things happen . I thought it 'd be different this time . Didn 't you ? We taste the same ! We all taste just like chicken ! Every day I get another chance . For every decision , there 's a consequence . Before he died , Garza sent me evidence for an old murder case , one my father worked on . This girl can lead me to the truth . Mr. Detweiler got Isabella the job . And I thought I found the guy behind it . I wanna know why the hell you 're doing this to me . But he works for someone else . I don 't know who , but I have his license plate . How the hell shall I proceed ? Kill them all . Now , I have to find out who he is . Somebody 's tense . Scratch your face . Are you growing a beard or something ? No , I guess I haven 't had time to shave . I thought you shaved it yesterday . What happened , here ? Nothing . Did I say something wrong ? Sometimes , I just can 't take the same questions , you know ? If you wanna grow a full beard , it 's fine by me . Bring it on ! Baby , what 's going on with you ? Come on , tell me . You wanna tell me about it ? What 's going on ? Why is this happening ? I just wanna know what happened to the man ... There 's a lot you 're not telling me . I just feel stuck . Stuck ? - What , like ... with us ? - With everything . Well , last time I checked , I 'm part of everything . - Is not you , okay ? - Okay . So what is it ? Fine ! I thought I found the bad guy in this case I 'm working . But it turns out he works for somebody that 's even worse . And I don 't know who is he , what he looks like and I don 't know his name . All I got is a licence plate number . But it 's not you . This is something I gotta figure out by myself . They 're not going to be happy . You allowed Hopper to make contact with you . He knows much more than he 's letting off . Oh yes , this is Detective Choi . I need you to run a licence plate for me , please . 1-E-4-9-9-0-8 . Do you have an address on that ? - Excuse me , can I ask you a question ? - Deliveries are around back . Let 's do this one more time . I have a question . Those cars out front , who uses them ? All of the cars are licenced to the Santayana Club for the exclusive use of our members . Well , I 'm interested in Conrad Detweiler . Who drives him ? This is a private club , sir . I 'm afraid I can 't divulge that info ... Can 't or won 't ? The director of operations handles all tranportation matters . If you 'll excuse me . Punk ! Excuse me , sir . Lloyd , please . Okay . Lloyd , I need to know where the director 's office is , please . You a new member , sir ? Yeah . I 'm planning on joining . I just need one of these guys to sponsor me . Do that and your first drink 's on me . Director 's office is to the left . I got you one of the best criminal defense attorney in the state . Barry Coldburn . Can I help you ? I hope not . Terry , report . I want your status . Have you stopped the suspect ? Soltis , hallway is clear . I don 't see this guy anywhere . Excuse me , what are you doing in here ? Sir , I 'm detective Brett Hopper . - If you have a moment , I 'd like- - - I 'm so sorry , detective . You are in the wrong place , everyone else is upstairs in the dinner room . Did you see anyone else in my office ? No , should I have ? Everything this morning has been so unexpected . You never know what you 're gonna wake up to . It 's him . That 's the man that killed my husband . Stay with Mrs Garza . The uniforms come with me ! Emergency exit is that way . Gosh ... We all taste just like chicken ! That was different . It 's you ! You okay ? I take your call again ! Stop running now ! Hey , that 's our guy , get him ! - Spivak . - Mrs Garza IDed Hopper . She did that last night , dude . No , she did it in person . Hopper was here , at the club . - What he was doing there ? - I didn 't have time to ask . Look , he got away but we have his truck so he 's not going far . Get Mrs Garza down here . I want her under protective custody . Do you think Hopper wanted to get to her ? She 's the only eye witness . What do you think ? Set a perimeter . I get more uniforms down there . Already on it . So is Shelten getting his back waxed in there or what ? The sergeant will see you when he 's ready . Just saying I got a Vietnamese girl who can get him speed already in under 20 minutes . What ? You haven 't eard yet , have you ? Heard what ? About your partner ... You know Hopper 's wanted for de Garza 's murder , right ? What are you talking about ? What murder ? You got to get that ? Come on , come on . If they think by keeping me here all day , that 's gonna change my story , they 're wrong . I know it 's rough . These guys can 't afford to make any mistakes . - There was so many eyes watching . - Brett was with me all night , Chad . There 's no way he could have killed anyone . I know ... But I 've heard they have conflicting testimony . What ? From who ? - Who is that ? - This none of your damned business . - What 's this ? - A search warrant . For Ms Shelton apartment . I don 't care how sick this kid is ! Fire him ! Yes , today ! Police business , I need this laptop . Sit down ! There you are ... Now let 's see who you hang out with . Don 't ! Trust me , you don 't wanna be found dead , man . How did you guys manage to find me without your little tracking device ? Let me guess , now we 're gonna take a little trip to the quarry to visit Detweiler . Oh aren 't you the shady paddy ? Don 't even think about ... Don 't kill me ! Please ! - Yeah ? - Hopper , where the hell are you ? Believe me , you don 't wanna know . What if other people wanna know ? Their hust saying you tried to kill Ms Garza at some club ... Well , that 's not what happened . I didn 't even know she was there . I went looking for a list of suspects of people who framed me , Andrea . I don 't know what you 're talking about . But they have half the force out there looking for you . Word is , you killed two ex-deputies . What ? You said they were two ex-cops ? Focus , Hopper ! Tell me what happened . They threatened me , but I did not shoot them . Well , who the hell did ? There was someone on the top of the building on the roof top . So now you 've got a garding angel with a snipe rifle . Do you hear yourself ? Did you call to give me a hard time or to help me out ? We need to talk . You 're making it very hard to be your friend right now . Andrea ? Hey , this is Rita . Leave a message . Just charged it ... - I need to find my brother . - Yeah , yeah , let 's go . Why are you doing this to me ? Here you go . Chad , I told you I 'm not hungry . Come on , we could be here a while . You got to keep your strength out . I did some asking around , it turns out that 's Garza 's wife . What ? - The guy ... - Yeah , the one Hopper whacked . Sorry . Word is , she 's homicide ace in the hall . Says she saw Hopper do the deed . It 's how they got the warrant - in the 1st place . - That 's not possible . Well , don 't kill the messenger ! What are you doing ? Rita ! Hey , no ! That 's a witness ! No you can 't ! Kill the lights . I got blood . Looks like somebody forgot to go to the cleaners . - Get this to the SID . Put a rush on it . - Right away , sir . What ? - This doesn 't fell right . - How 's that ? A decorated cop decides to kill a man he never met . And stashes the gun at his place and leaves a bloody shirt right around his girlfriend 's apartment ? Leave the room , guys . Don 't ever question a case in front of anyone else . When I see something hinky , I 'm not gonna keep quiet about it . Hopper 's too smart - to do some this stupid ... - All killers make mistakes . Even the smart ones , especially the smart ones . They all think they 're not getting get caught but they always do . So get used to it : Hopper 's the guy ... - You have a problem ? - No ... No problem . Just sounds like you wanna nail Hopper more than you wanna catch Garza 's killer . - Yeah ? - Brett ? Rita . Thank God . Are you OK ? I 've been so worried . Yeah , I know , I 'm sorry . Listen , now I know they 're telling you all sorts of things about me . They have an eyewitness , Brett . The wife . Yeah , I know . - How do you know ? - I just know . She 's lying . And what about the shirt ? - What shirt ? - Your shirt . The one they found in my apartment . With blood on it . They 're saying it 's a match to that man Garza . Wait . That 's ... That 's never happened before ... Maybe you should think about turning yourself in . Wait . Really , you don 't think I did this ? Baby . Did somebody gets to you ? What 's happening ? Brett , we can get you helped . I mean it 's best for everyone . What do you mean ? What are you talking about , " we " ? Who 's " we " ? Give yourself up , Hopper . It 's the only chance you have right now . - Yeah , I got to go . - Brett , please . DAY 2 ( del vo ) Did I say something wrong ? Are you even listening ? - Sorry , what ? - What is it with you , Brett ? You woke up and made conversation to dump out a hamper . You wouldn 't understand . How must I understand , Brett , if you won 't even talk to me ? Because , I 've told you already . - When ? - Yesterday . And the yesterday before that . And the yesterday before that . It 's not your fault , I just ... - What are you talking about ? - I wish somebody would remember something , anything that I told them , anything that I said . In 20 seconds that phone is gonna ring and it 's gonna be Andrea . She 's gonna call and tell me that she 's taking Eddie to rehad because he started using again . Now , at first Eddie was killed , but then I changed the day . Alright , so ... Right now , honestly I 'm just trying to ... - Are you okay ? - No , I definitly am not ok . Hey , Andrea . Yeah , he is here . Can he call you back ? You 're totaly freaking me out . - This is some kind of ... - I 'm sorry , I really am . I can 't have this conversation today . I see you ... What are you doing here ? You 're not supposed to be in here . - Why the hell are you following me ? - I 'm always here ! You 're the new guy , I 'm here every day . - " I 'm here every day " ? - I mean today . Only a different " today " . - Look , I don 't have time to explain . - You know what ? I think you do ! No way . - You can never believe me . Nobody does . - Try me . I don 't even understand . - Spit it out ! - It 's always today ! Over and over ! And I 'm stuck in it , okay ? There ... You 're happy ? Say that again . I know how it sounds . You 're saying it 's the same day that it 's repeating ? Go ahead , laugh . I 've to get back to work . Director dude 's gonna show up and there isn 't much time . Do you recognize me ? I don 't know . - Should I ? - Come on , man . It 's important . Why ? Why do you care ? Because the same thing is happening to me too . Very funny . You make fun of the cripple kid . You want my lunch money ? I 'm not joking , you 've seen me before , haven 't you ? At the police station . I tell them I 'm looking for my brother . But everyday , it 's the same . It 's the same for me too . I wake up in the same place , same time same damn bird , same damn Dodger game ! The Dodgers ... - Do they win ? - Yes . They rally in the bottom of the neith . Finally ! It 's okay . He is a very close fan of mister Garza . He just heard what happened , sorry man . Of course , I ... just need to get my day planner . Listen ! He just lost one of his best friends . Just give us a minute , please ! Of course . Come on , we got to get out of here man , too many cops around . But I 'm not finished ! Finished with what ? It 's a membership list . The man who took my brother belongs to this club . So your brother 's missing ? Not missing . They took him . But I 've been coming here everyday , trying to find the guy that did it . What 's his name ? I don 't know . I know what he looks like . With glasses . So you just come here everyday and hope he just shows up ? No , I 've got a plan , I 'm not an idiot ! I 'm memorizing the membership list Names , addresses , the whole enchilada ! I 'm already up to the end of this . Here a better plan . - Mr. Summer ? - I know this is a delicate situation . And I 'm pleased the club can offer our members a safe respite in their time of need . Your point . We have an extremely demanding membership . I cannot afford having one of your detectives coming into my office . Our people are all here in this room . I beg to differ . This ... African American gentleman just flashed me his badge and kicked me out ! Show me . This is Choi . Keep a detail on Mrs. Garza and lock down the building . How long has this been happening to you ? - What ? - The day . Repeating . I didn 't have this . I don 't know anymore . How about you ? Three weeks . Three ... That 's the ... That 's the magic number . Oh , you gotta be kidding me ... Open every door , every closet , every bathroom stall . Hey man ... Dude , what did you do to me ? Nothing . You blacked out . I hate that . Happens a lot . That 's freaky . I fall asleep one place and wake up somewhere else . Especially after they sticked me with that needle . They stick you with a needle ? Yeah . Relax . Just a mild sedative . - Did they take you to a quarry ? - No . Some kind of lab . That 's were they grabbed my brother . Since they though that I was asleep . But I heard Forasz talking about this fancy fancy schmaltzy club that he belongs to . And I ... I 've just got the name onto my brain . - The Santyana Club . - Go back . Who 's Forasz ? That 's how everybody called him . The son of a bitch took my brother . I 'm telling that there is a conspiracy going on here . Detweiler , he is the one who injected me . He 's only a middle mouse , man , but I want the man on top . - That dude is a member here too . - Yeah . You think that we 're both looking for the same guy ? If I 'm right , his name is right here . Give me the key of that door . This is so great . We can buy them together . We 'd be like Butch and Sundance , Bonnie and Clyde ! Ok , it 's just ... nice not to be alone . Alright , come here . You gotta stay right here . - What 's your name ? - Hopper . - Like the painter , that 's cool . - I 'm Jared . Do you have any idea why this is happening ? No , and i don 't know how to make it stop . How did you , like , handle it ? The only way I know how , be a cop . How do you manage to do those things in pen ? Practice I guess . Help me out . Do you know Conrad Detweiler ? Sorry . I can 't help you . I 'm more interested in who he hangs with . It 's important . Maybe ... you can help me with something , though . 73 across . Sir . I wouldn 't . The emergency exit is that way . Get in man , get in . M. Colburn , Detective Brett Hopper . We have a mutual acquaintance . Nathan Baxter . Go . Hey , drive ! You 're the one the cops are after for the Garza murder . How do you know that ? Small club , word gets around ... You shouldn 't believe everything you hear . Actually I 'm being framed by members of your club . It 's a very serious charge . That 's why I need a good lawyer to help me prove it . Come on . You didn 't jump in my car to hire me as your defense attorney . You got in because you need a quick get away My retainers starts at $ 30000 How is an honest cops supposed to come up with cash like that ? You 're right . Gimme a dollar . You are now protected on the attorney-client privilege . What about your fee ? Oh , I can make ten times that on the book too . Let 's go to my office . So you telling me you were with Hopper all night . He went to bed with me , he woke up next me . I don 't know how to be any clearer . I appreciate that and I wanna believe you , really . You know ... When I ran your drivers licence , some interesting information came up . - That 's not relevent . - I was hoping you might have learned a few things since 2002 like telling the truth . I said she 's done talking to you . This is a homicide investigation . And I 'm not sure you want her booked as an accessory . She stays . Come on . I thought that went away . How would he know that ? They 're just bluffing . Don 't worry about it , I took care of it . This is Jared Pryor . He claims he was with Hopper this morning . Yeah , but we can 't talk about it ... It 's him and me are the same . - The same ? - You know , peas in a pod . Flies in the ointment . Can you tell us why you and Detective Hopper were at the Santayana club ? I can 't really say . But if you know who Detweiler , working for , let me know . Detweiler ? - Who 's that ? - Do you know where Hopper is now ? Sure . He 's looking for the man who 's making it today over and over again ! We both are ! Yeah , well ... Good luck with that . Now as my lawyer , you have full access to the evidence against me , right ? Well , we 're get into that . But first , there are a few ground rules . Don 't talk to anyone about the case . No wives , girlfriends , that could make them potential witnesses in a trial . And don 't talk to the press about anything . Do you have a publicist ? All right , I could recommend one for you . This case is gonna be trialed in the media ... Hopper shouldn 't have receive the package yet , it 's important . This hourglass was found next to a dead body . Now you got 3 minutes , start talking . Tell me about this hourglass . - It 's from the club . What does that ... - Shut up ! I 'm asking the questions . - Who else has one ? - Everyone on the board . - What board ? - I can 't tell you if I can 't breathe . The Santayana board of directors . Every member of the board past and present , gets an hourglass when they 're voted in . Kind of an inside joke . Keep them from talking too long at meetings . Would you mind telling me what is so important about a damn hourglass ? It 's the second one I 've seen just like it . - The 1st was sent to me by Garza . - But you said you didn 't know him . I never event met the guy . I don 't know why he sent it . But it 's evidence in a 15 year old murder case . Isabella Contreras . I think she worked at your club and was killed by one of your members . What has an old murder case have to do with Garza ? I don 't know but it 's all connected to this club . That 's why you saw me there , I was after this . - A list of members . - And you suspect them , don 't you ? Yeah , one or more of these men is a killer . If you 're right , and I hardly doubt that you are , you 've narrowed it down to the 400 of the richest most powerful people in the city . How many of them are on the board of the directors ? A couple dozen ? Yes , sounds right . - Who are they ? - You really want to know ? All right . Here Robert Diminico . He 's the deputy mayor . Winston Wales , philantropist . Giselle Mack runs the city art 's foundation . Seth Bath . Alex Forasz . Here 's your friend Garza . Wait . Go back . Forasz ... I heard Forasz talking about this ... this fancy schmaltzy club that he belongs to . Good luck , detective ! The DA is gonna be pushing hard on this one ! Why don 't you just let me push back ? I 'll make some calls , see how strong that case is . But ... Next time ... No choking ... Yeah . - Hopper ! - Hey , Andrea . I need you to run a check on an Alexander Forasz . See if he has a jacket . - Hopper , what is going on ? There 's a board out on you . Robbery , homicides . I know . I killed Garza and went after his wife , and I did a bunch of bad stuff . How can you be so damn flip about this ? Because I don 't have the time . you always end up helping me in the end , so could we just skip to that , please ? I always help you ? What am I , your secretary ? No , you 're my partner . All right , you have to give me a second , this hasn 't exactly been my easiest day . Yeah , well , you and me both . - What was that name again ? - Forasz . F-O-R-A-S-Z . Alexander Forasz . Okay , I 've got a hit . But he 's clean . Not even a parking ticket . What 's the hit ? He filed a restraining order against some guy named Jared Pryor . I 'm Jared . Is this helping ? Yeah . Do you have an adress for Forasz ? I did some asking around , it turns out that 's Garza 's wife . What are you doing ? You can 't just ... That 's a witness ! You can 't just ... Rita ! Thank you . I know you 're in a lot of pain and I 'm ... I 'm so sorry . But you 're wrong about him . What ? Brett Hopper couldn 't have killed your husband . He was with me all night . Who are you ? I 'm his girlfriend . Alberto was my husband . We were married for twenty-two years . - I 'm so sorry . - I heard his name first . Your boyfriend . Alberto said it ... Hopper . Clear as I am saying it to you . And then I heard ... I came downstairs but he was ... Alberto was liying there . I saw him . Standing over my husband , with a gun . I saw his face . Detective Hopper ? Barry Coldburn . We 've got problems . Can you be a little more specific or is that on my dollar bills ? Well , to begin , they 've got the murder weapon with your prints , your shirt , with Garza 's blood on it , not to mention the eyewitness , Garza 's wife . - She 's lying . - It doesn 't matter . The prosecution puts the grieving widow on the stand , you might as well start planning the menu for your last meal . Look , the cops are in on this , on all levels . Witnesses lie , lab results get doctored . If you 're saying to me an entire system is against you , that this is one big conspiracy , let me warn you , juries don 't take kindly to the C word . - I know how this sounds . - Do you ? If you 're laying pipe for an insanity defense ... That 's not what this is . I 'm being framed . Yeah , maybe ... but as your attorney , I have to advise you . The evidence against you is ... extremely compelling . If you want my best advise , take a plea . I can probably get you murder II . That 's fifteen to life , but no chances of the death penalty So , thanks . Thanks for helping me out . I have to be really careful . Sorry , man . Okay , I confess ! I killed Alberto Garza . - Alright ? - No , you didn 't , you idiot ! Where is Detweiler ? On the swing set ? You 've been playing in the wrong park ! I know he 's answered to somebody at the club , is that you ? Forget about the Santayana Club . You won 't get any answers there . But where am I supposed to look ? A little closer to home . Thanks , that 's helpful ! Your old man was on the right track with the girl . My old man ? What are you talking about ? Here , smart guy ... Figure it out ! For the zip ties . Who are you , guys ? Think of us as ... friends of your father . DAY 3 ( del vo ) Somebody 's tense . What 's wrong ? Nothing . We went to bed last night , and everything was fine . What happened ? Did you have a nightmare or something ? The worst ever . That 's okay . It 's just a dream . Yeah , Jen , it 's me , we need to talk . It 's ... about Dad . I 'm wondering if you have any of his old stuff ? I 'll call you back later today . Jared ! Get in , man . Get in . Why are we here ? Do you know a man named Alexander Forasz ? Yeah . Maybe . I ... I think so . I am not sure . He took a restraining order out against you . Yeah , well , that 's because I almost caught him . But he got away ! You think he 's the one who took my brother ? The one that we 're looking for ? That 's the reason we 're here . Come on . I can 't do this . Could you just ... You know , while I stay here ? - Are you sure ? - Yeah . Alright . Yes ? LAPD . I 'd like to as some questions about a Jared Pryor . You know , I have a restraining order against him . Yes , that 's why I 'm here . Please , sir , it 's important . Would you like some coffee , detective ... Hopper . I thought you might know that . How do you know Jared Pryor ? It 's complicated . I 'm sure it is . Did Detweiler introduce you ? - Who ? - Did you meet to the Santayana Club ? A club ? - How do you know I belong to the club ? - What did you do to Jared ? - What did you do with his brother ? - Nothing ! - Who the hell are you ? - I was his surgeon ! His surgeon ? Jared was ... He was a successful bond trader for one of the largest firm in the whole world , until his seizures just got out of control . Seizures ? - From what ? - Temporal lobe epilepsy . Jared had one of the worst cases we 'd ever seen . It got so drastic he just couldn 't function . We had to perform surgery . Like in brain surgery ? Yes , sir . We saved his life . But there were side effects . Hallucinations , black-outs , even sufferance from hyperactive episodes of déja-vu " Déja-vu " ? It 's that feeling that you 're reliving a moment over and over . Yeah . I think I 've heard of it . Jared will have multiples episodes of this every day . So he latches on to what 's familiar . He 'll repeat routines , he 'll go to the same place day after day . He will have ... sudden bursts of memory . That 's there is just so much about the brain that ... we don 't understand . Like the memory of his brother . - What happen to his brother ? - Well , he died . Cancer more than a year ago , but see , Jared doesn 't remember . As far as he 's concerned , his brother was alive when he went into surgery and gone when he woke up , so ... In a sens , yeah ... I 'm responsible . I took the memory of his brother away from him and that 's why he comes after me . He actually believes that he is a victim of some sort of grand conspiracy and that I 'm , some king of lean leader . How would somebody know if they had this ... condition ? Other than the seizures ? They ... They probably wouldn 't but ... So ? He 's not who I thought he was . He want 's to talk to you though . He 'll tell you everything . Did you find my brother ? No , but Forasz said he 'll ... He 'll tell you where he is . Thank you . For what ? You 're the first person that believe in me . The first one that really understood . I 've been alone , for so long . Anyway , I owe you an apology . I shouldn 't have treated you the way that I did . Don 't worry about it . We 're good . Still , I 'm sorry I bit you .

 Previously on Heroes . Peter , I 'm your brother . You gave me this hunger . You made me a monster . Now I can 't control it . I 'm just like you . They want to create a world filled with dangerous people . They will destroy everything . Dad . Come give your father a hug . You don 't have your powers anymore , Peter . Because I have them now . You 're a monster . I wish you hadn 't said that . We need your help . We can be of great assistance to each other . And you 're sure there 's no side effects ? I came to you for help . What have you done to us ? We 're not finished here . Pull the trigger . You can 't fight him . That was fun , huh ? Show 's over . What is it ? I 'm not sure , but I 've definitely seen this card before . - You 're going to Africa . - Precog . He can see the future . Whatever he paints comes true . My boss can 't have someone like that out there . Evil forces gather . The dark sun rises . Soon it will be too late . Will you choose your own path , or will you have it chosen for you ? You 've ruined everything ! Don 't come any closer . What the hell happened in here ? I 'm trying to help Maya , to remove her ability . So you knock us out ? You experiment on us ? Your abilities are synthetic . They may hold the key to creating a cure . If I could have one more sample ... No , it 's finished . We 're done . Dad 's dead . He had a heart attack this morning . Your father , he was deeply flawed in ways you will never know . I can 't believe he 's gone . Dad 's dead . Dad . You 're dead . Dad 's dead . He had a heart attack this morning . Come give your father a hug . I 'm sorry it had to come to this . Take it easy , Peter . Your body is still in shock . You took my abilities . You gave me no choice , Son . Are they gone forever ? Yes . How am I supposed to believe any of this ? You 've been dead for over a year , then I find you preaching to some super-villain gang ? I 'm sorry that I lied to you and your brother , but I 've had to make hard choices for the greater good . Giving everyone on the planet an ability , that 's really your idea of the greater good ? That 's not what I want . That 's what happens . I 've seen the future , Dad . I 've seen the whole neighborhood get nuked . You can help me . Together , we can make sure that the future you saw never happens . Once you understand what I 'm doing ... I 'm not interested in what you 're doing . And with or without my powers , I 'm going to find a way to shut you down , and I 'm going to make you pay for everything you 've ever done . Son , until you change that attitude , you 're grounded . You okay ? I think so . Is that weird ? We just starred in the human puppet show , my dad is working with a serial killer and I can 't feel pain . Claire , the things you deal with , the demons you face , I can 't imagine . How you handle them , that you stay strong in the face of it all , that makes me proud . Thanks . What 's wrong with the lights ? Let me check the circuit breakers . Lyle ! Oh , my God . What happened ? Are you okay ? The bitch is back . Elle ? Hey , cheerleader . What the hell are you doing here ? Get out of my house . Not until I get what I came for . Fine . Then I 'll throw you out . Leave me the hell alone ! Why are you here ? I 'm sorry . I need help , and I didn 't know where else to go . I apologize for keeping you waiting , Doctor . I 'm Arthur Petrelli . Everyone thinks you 're dead . That was the idea . What could possibly drive a father to put his children through such grief ? Have you met their mother ? How 's our patient ? Terrified . She thinks I 'm a monster and has no idea where she is . Nor do I , for that matter . You 're among friends . I promised Maya I would remove her abilities and end her suffering . I will do anything to keep that promise . All you have to do is watch . Get away from me . Get him out of here . You 're telling me all traces of Maya 's ability have been removed from her system ? I take it all and leave nothing behind . Could you do the same to me ? Is that what you want ? To be normal again ? I injected myself with an unstable formula . Its side effects are changing me into something else , something I don 't understand . I need to find a way to reverse the changes and retain my abilities . This isn 't my formula . The cytologies are similar , but these protein links are enmeshed . Has it been successful ? We 've taken it as far as we can . That 's why we need you . If you can make our version of the formula successful , a fresh injection might be exactly what you need . I 've been down this road before . There is always a hidden agenda , a self-serving motivation behind it all . If you don 't want to be here , leave . I 'll need test subjects . Gabriel . Mom , how are you here ? You 're sick . Peter needs your help . Peter doesn 't want anything to do with me . He thinks I 'm just a killer . This isn 't about what he wants , this is about what I 'm telling you to do . Now , stop feeling sorry for yourself and get out of this cell . This is where I belong , in a cage . I couldn 't escape even if I wanted to . They 're blocking my abilities . Then how do you explain my being here ? Oh , Gabriel , you don 't know the half of what you 're capable of . Show them . Show them all why you 're my favorite . Make Mommy proud . Don 't worry , Mom . I 'll save Peter . Are you gonna be okay ? Yeah , fine . I 'm leaving . Is there something wrong with you ? I can 't control it anymore . I keep overloading and I can 't eat , I can 't sleep . This girl found me and said I should go to this company , Pinehearst , that they knew what was wrong with me and how to get me better , but I 've never heard of it . I didn 't want to go there without knowing what the deal was , and your dad always seemed to be the one with the answers , so home invasion time . What if there 's something wrong with all of us and they can fix it ? You 're fine . You 're perfect . No , I 'm not . Whatever is happening to you , it 's happening to me , too . You 're still healing , aren 't you ? Yeah . But I can 't feel pain , and I think it 's only a matter of time before I can 't feel anything at all . You can 't feel pain . I wish I had your problems , cheerleader . My body is screaming . I 'm in agony . Go with me . If there is a chance that these people at Pinehearst can help us ... We 'll go together . All right , Dorothy , then we 're off to see the wizard . Daphne , you have a mess to clean up . I do ? You were supposed to recruit my son , Matt Parkman . Yeah , I gave him the pitch , but he wasn 't buying . I mean , the guy 's a mind reader . Were you thinking something which would discourage him from joining us ? That 's not what I meant . She 's lying . I am not . Then why are you so scared ? How can I fix this ? Revisit Mr. Parkman ... But I don 't think he 's gonna take the deal . You 're not going there to offer him anything , you 're going there to kill him . What ? I just asked her to kill your son , Maury . Is that a problem ? You 're damn right . My loyalty for his safety , that was the arrangement . I 'm a thief . I steal things . There is no way I could kill anybody . I 'm not gonna let you do this , Arthur . You 're not in a position to give me orders . I 'm Matt 's father , without me , you 'd still be lying ... Thank you , Maury , for all your sacrifice . Please , there has to be another way . But you don 't know anything about this place . Look , Elle needs help , and so do I. This Pinehearst place could be our best shot . Pinehearst , sounds like a dishwashing liquid . I gotta call your dad . Mom , please don 't . Claire , he loves you . I know . But there is something inside of me and it 's broken . And he can 't fix it . I think I 'm the only one who can . Do you understand that ? Do you really think you can trust Elle ? No . But we both want the same thing . We need our abilities under control . If she gives you any lip , you just toss a glass of water on her , Lyle style . - This is Dr. Mohinder Suresh . - I 'm not available , please leave a message and I 'll call you back . Mohinder , Matt . Where the hell have you been , man ? I just got back from the craziest week of my life . Do me a favor , give me a call as soon as possible , okay ? Put down the phone . Daphne , what are you doing ? They think that I told you not to come to Pinehearst , that I warned you away . They don 't believe I 'm one of them . Well , you 're not . Shut up . If I don 't kill you , they 'll kill me . Shoot . What ? Shoot me . Go ahead . If it 's the only way that I can save your life , do it . You think you know me , that I 'm worth saving , but I 've done some bad things . Yeah , but you make up for all that in the future . I don 't have a future unless I kill you , so turn around . Do it . We get married . We start a family together . Stop it . We 're gonna love each other . I 'm sorry , Matt . It happened so fast , there was nothing I could do . My dad ? So , I guess you 're not gonna help me . Don 't do this , Dad . Please , you 're gonna destroy the world . I don 't see it that way . You think you 're better than everyone else , that you have the right to do whatever you want , hurt anyone that gets in your way ? I am better , Peter . It 's not a belief , it 's a fact . And one way or another , you will help me get this done . Suresh . Hello , Peter . So , you 're helping my father ? I prefer to think he 's helping me . And what is that ? Your metabolism is primed to accept abilities , which makes you the ideal test case for a new version of a formula I need to perfect . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . When I saw you in the future , you said that manipulating abilities was wrong , that this was all a mistake . Did I ? You were trying to help me , Mohinder . Peter , tell me something . In this future of yours , what do I look like ? There was something wrong with you . You 'd changed . You looked like a monster . Then you 're too late . Suresh , no . Hello , Mohinder . You came for me ? That 's what brothers do , Peter . They look out for each other . Even after I locked you up ? Let 's get out of here . - Stop ! Leave him alone ! - He deserves to die ! Peter ! This is for killing my father ! That 's enough ! Enough ! Do you know who this man is ? Do you have any idea how many innocent people he 's killed ? I do , but he 's also my son . And I 've been waiting for him for a long time . It 's been hours . Who 'd you talk to over there ? Some guy from the Company . He can keep a secret , right ? I hope so . Do you think they 're alive ? Do you think they 're human ? What if they can 't breathe ? Tracy . We need to help them . Be careful . Oh , God . It 's too tough . I told you not to touch anything . You . Meredith ? Nathan . Well , I see you 've still got a weakness for blondes . Everything all right ? I 'm what some people would refer to as an anxious flier . Big , tough Company agent can 't handle being 30,000 feet up ? Yeah , well , I was never a very good agent . So I read . You let all those villains escape Level 5 , right ? Shut up . Yeah , I caught Doyle . I helped clean up your mess . Doyle ? Yeah , the freak with the puppets . This agent thing isn 't so hard . You know , my father pushed me into this life . I wanted no part of it , and if you do , you 're an idiot . Elle . You have no idea how good you have it . This is your captain speaking . We 'd like to remind our passengers to turn off all electrical equipment . Thank you . I think he 's talking about you . Shut up . Seriously , calm down . You have to turn it off or we 're going to crash . If I knew how to do that , I wouldn 't be here in the first place . Take my hand . Let me help you . Dump your electricity into me . Do it ! We did it . Do you mind ? My dad and I weren 't even close . But to think that he would ever put himself in danger to protect me ... Well , he didn 't do it so you could sit around here and wait to get killed . What do you mean ? Pinehearst . They 'll be sending someone after me to make sure you 're dead . Let them come . Oh , yeah , great . Then you use your brain mojo thingy . Perfect . If you need to go , I understand . But I can 't let them get away with this . I want to help you . I 'm just scared . So am I , but we can 't let our fears stop us from doing what 's right . I knew you couldn 't kill him . I 'm sorry , Matt . No , stick to the plan . Your fear is making me strong , girl . I can 't . No . No ! Stop ! You think you can hold me with your power . Not only can I hold you , I can kill you . I 'm gonna dig inside your head , find your worst fear and make it eat you alive . I 'm not the one that 's scared , you are , and your fear just makes me strong . Matt , that was amazing . Yeah . I just got inside his head with my brain mojo thingy . My dad could do the same thing . Now that they think that we 're dead , we have time to get away . No . I told you I 'm not running . What are you gonna do , Matt ? Fight them ? Trick them into killing each other ? That 's not gonna bring your dad back , but it will probably get you killed . I 'm a cop . Stopping guys like Knox , that 's what I do . You can 't bring them down by yourself . There 's no way . Even with me at your back , we 'd still need help . There 's a company , Primatech , they know how to deal with situations like this . If anybody can help , they can . This building 's sealed up tight . If Peter 's still here , he ain 't getting out . Peter 's long gone . If I find him , you want him crispy or well done ? Alive , please . All right . I sent somebody to recruit you . When you refused her offer , I didn 't expect to see you here . My mother 's in a coma , did you do that ? Angela 's not the woman you think she is , Gabriel . She 's done terrible things . So have I , and I 'm gonna do them all to you . Has Angela forgiven your sins ? My mother accepts me for who I am . I wonder if you 'll be so generous . What are you talking about ? She sent you here , didn 't she ? To save her favorite son . She tell you that you were all gonna live happily ever after ? She 's using you , Son , as a weapon , a blunt instrument to be manipulated and then discarded . My mother loves me . When you were born , she had one of her dreams , a vision of the future . She saw what you would become . I know this . She told me I 'd become a hero . Did she ? Angela was so terrified of what she saw , so frightened of her own flesh and blood , that she tried to kill you . Imagine that , a mother wanting to murder her own child . I got to the bathroom just in time . She was holding you at the bottom of the tub . It 's time you learned the truth about your mother . That 's far enough . I was told you were leaving . Maybe one day I could forgive you , but after everything that 's happened , I just ... I don 't think I could ever trust you . I know it 's hard to believe , but I was trying to help . My feelings for you were real . Those feelings are still there . What you did in my name was wrong . I wish I could take it all back . I 've done bad things . Killed people . Not by choice , but still , I did them . I need to make amends , and so do you . Get well , Mohinder . Hold on . We 're almost there . You all right ? Thank you . For what ? For helping me . I 've been nothing but a bitch , and you 've been nothing but sweet . Really , it just makes me hate you more . No , I should be the one thanking you . Why ? Because I was ready to give up , stay home , deny everything that 's been happening to me . I was scared . Scared of what ? What I would find out about who I really am . It 's just ... It 's nice to know that you 're as messed up as I am . Peter , you stayed ? I wasn 't gonna leave you . What are you doing sitting here ? Did he take your powers ? No , he told me the truth . You can 't listen to him . He 's our father . He 's my father . I grew up with him . And I didn 't , so I don 't get the right to know him ? Is that what you 're saying ? He can 't be trusted . You 've seen what he 's done . He hurt mom . He 's manipulated abilities . I know where that leads . The world you saw doesn 't exist . We won 't let it . I 'm sorry , Peter , this is something I have to do . If you help him , you 're proving the worst things I 've said about you . Just kick his ass , and let 's get out of here . Oh , I 'm not going anywhere , Peter . You are . Oh , my God , Peter ! Peter ! What are you doing here ? Why are you bleeding ? He 's not healing . He took my ability . We need to go . Elle , help me get him in the car . Claire , did you hear what he said ? That they took his ability , that 's what we came here for . You don 't know what happened up there . I 'm sorry , Claire . Elle . You can 't heal . How did you fall that far and not die ? I don 't know . Okay , let me get this straight . She 's the biological mother of your illegitimate daughter , and he 's her adopted father . That sounds about right . Did Suresh inject you with anything ? Yeah , a tranquilizer , why ? What 's he doing in there ? Building a nest , laying eggs . Who the hell knows ? You 're both gonna have to come in to the Company to be tested . For what ? Just to be sure you 're still normal . So , you working with him ? For now . Excuse me . Petrelli . I 'd watch out for that one . We 're not together . Oh . Claire ? Slow down . Slow down . Where are you ? No , I won 't tell anyone . Peter 's never gonna give up , you know . I would expect nothing less of a Petrelli . Revenge is in our blood . Are we just gonna wait for him to come after us ? No , Son . We 're gonna take our fight to the enemy . How do you suppose Peter survived that fall ? Seven stories without the ability to heal . Hell of a thing . I don 't know . Hello ? It worked . He thinks I 'm on his side . Good job . If he reaches out to Primatech , I 'll let you know what they say . Screw this up and I 'll put you right back where I found you . I keep thinking about that fall , how I didn 't hit as hard as I should have . What if Sylar didn 't want me to die ? What if he wanted to get me out of there alive ? By throwing you out of a window ? He could 've used his ability to slow me down . I 'm telling you , he saved my life , Claire . Claire . It 's all right , she 's good . What happened ? Why aren 't you healing ? I don 't have my powers anymore , Nathan . Dad took them . Dad 's dead . He 's not , he 's alive . I was there , Pete . I saw ... He 's alive , Nathan . And if we don 't do something to stop him , he 's gonna kill us all . That 's just ... It 's impossible , Pete . Dad died over a year ago . He 's the one who put Mom in that coma . Pete , this is our dad we 're talking about here . Believe me , dads aren 't always what they seem . Where is he ? Stay away from him . He 's dangerous , Nathan . Look what he did to me . If our father 's alive , I need to know where he is . What 's the name of the company ? Pinehearst . Pinehearst , the biotech firm ? No , I 'm not gonna let you do this . Nathan , trust me . Please . Okay . We 'll do it your way . There 's a lot of ways to shut Pinehearst down . Look , I 'll call somebody up from the Justice Department . We 'll get some help . You 're not gonna listen to a word he just said , are you ? Nope . I 'm gonna see my father . How do you know about Pinehearst ? I 've been taking a consultant fee from them for over a year . I 'm coming with you . I know the players there . I can open doors . I don 't need any doors opened . I plan on kicking them down . Is that food ? It 's a recipe . It 's been in my family for thousands of years . You refuse to go back in time , even if it means saving the world . I cannot risk changing history . If only there 's some other way of learning about my enemies , uncovering their weak parts , so I can defeat them . For thousands of years , my family have taken spirit walks , following destiny 's path into the realms of the unconsciousness . Delicious . Spirit walk sounds much safer than time travel . Okay . I 'm ready to begin my journey . How do I start ? You eat a disgusting paste made from the roots of a Tamboti tree and the dung of hyena . And then ? You wait . Hiro ? Hiro ? You tricked him . I warned him . If he did not choose his path , it would be chosen for him . Hiro . Hiro . He 's going to wake up , right ? He 's going to be okay ? Hiro . Hiro . Hiro . Hiro .

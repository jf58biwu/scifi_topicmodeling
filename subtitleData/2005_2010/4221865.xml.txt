 Mr. Jones . Mr. Kohl . I have the appeal request All prepared and ready to go . ? ? I think that the best we can hope for is life . All i need is your signature . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Capture : FRM @ ID Sync : FRS @ ÂÒ ² ¨ FRINGE S01 ep14 Hey . Mornin ' . Is your father about ? Right here . Why don 't you ask him what he 's doing ? ? Listen , do you remember that prisoner jones i went to see- - - In germany , right ? - He escaped . Good for him . How ? Uh , nobody knows . It makes no sense . The german authorities came to seme last night . How come when nobody knows and it doesn 't make sense , They come to us ? Well , what we do know is that jones Was working with mitchel loeb . I remember loeb . ? Yeah , i 'm gonna go and talk to him now . But can you describe to me again what you made ? What loeb was stealing . And why don 't you tell her the truth this time . He kind of sugar-Coated it last time around . You did ? Why ? Is it something that could have helped jones escape ? It was a transportation device . I called it dizray . Coined based on the premise Disintegration , reintegration . Dis-Re , dizray . Are you saying that you created- - A teleportation system , yeah . Except for this one 's meant to travel through time . How 's that ? Assuming someone could solve the considerable problems . Coming through , arriving Would require weeks of decompression In a barometric tank . And if you survived that , based on what would happen next , You 'd likely wish you hadn 't . So you 're saying that jones , in theory , Could have zapped himself out of prison . Uh ... Yes . ? ? ? - Cup of tea , please - Of course . Firstly , i 'd like to thank you For the work you 've done for bringing me here . I understand there have been sacrifices . I am grateful to them As i am to you . Everything is in order then ? Yes , sir . The list is comple . We 've got a lab set to your specifications . And the sealant ? All parts . Good . Hey , you know , it 's not a library here , you know . And i don 't make loans . Ah , 75 cents , my friend . Course it 's old news now , Given the old internet and all that . You must be an old traditionalist Like myself , right ? Hey , hey , hey , i like these . You don 't see the two dollar very often . Thanks ! I 'll keep it . Okay , so , tommie ... you were right . Yeah , you see that ? Grace kelly ? She was good . But jimmy stewart was better . I 'm creatin ' cinephiles one reader at a time . Now , listen , i want you to check out a movie Called , uh , charade . - Ever seen it ? - Never heard of it . Oh . Oh , god . Oh ! Oh , uh ... There 's something in my eyes . You okay ? I ... Ohh ... Oh , god . Tommie , you okay ? Oh , my eyes ! Oh , my god ! Aah ! Oh , tommie ! Tommie ! Aah ! Someone ! Ohh ! Oh , tommie ! ? Somebody call an ambulance ! ? ? Uh , nothing local on jones . But , uh ... we found some financial records For salman kohl , jones 's attorney . The man found dead in jones ' cell ? He kept a slush fund that he maintained Under an assumed name . Could be a mistress . Or something less salacious . More interesting . Let me know if you find something useful . ? I know about david robert jones . I know that you helped him escape . And that you kidnapped me on that same night . You know where jones is . You 're not someone i ... really wanna work with . Your transfer order . To wallens ridge state prison . You know what that place is like , mitchell . You know what they 're gonna do to you , What it 's gonna be like that first night ? The second ? Doesn 't matter if you find jones or not . He 's just a part of the army . What was written will come to pass . And nothing you do can stop that . Nothing . Agent dunham . ? ? Name 's thomas avery . Runs a news stand downtown . His only prior physical conditions Were high cholestel and a weak bladder . According to witnesses , The whole thing happened in less than two minutes . Ceramides . They act as a signaling molecule in skin . They control how the cells grow and differentiate . Two thoughts come to mind . The first , that this affliction Might have been caused by a mutation , Changing these lipids to recognize and seal Any and all orifices . Did they check his anus and penis ? You think we could get the answer to that question Without me in the room ? What was the other thought ? Sorr You said two thoughts came to mind . Ah , yes . The other was ... Coffee cake . Tiny pebes of cinnamon sugar . Once again , my father . You know what this is . You think jones ? Help me with this . You talked to loeb . Did he give anything ? Maybe , but nothing that relates to this , exactly . Well , i 'm not convinced this is jones ' work . And what interest would he have in a newsstand operator ? That 's what we 're going to find out . Peter ... You got a sec ? When i saw loeb , he said something . That jones was only doing what had been written . Meaning what ? Written where ? I didn 't know , but it made me think We 've never known what z.T.F. Stood for . Maybe it 's not the name of their organization . What if it 's the name of their bible ? Interesting . So i called a contact at the german authorities And asked him to search any known document With those initials . Did he or she find anything ? Yes , he did . ? - Z.F.T. - Z.F.T. Scroll down . Destruction by advancement of technology . It 's a self-Published anonymous manuscript , On their records only because it was Recovered as evidence in a police raid In an unrelated case . They sending it to us ? They would be if it hadn 't been destroyed Ten years ago . So ... i was hoping that you might have One of your ... Weird connections . Weird connections ? They 're always a little weird . Well , you 're always a little weird . What do you think ? ? I think i got a weird connection . He contagious ? If he were contagious , We 'd have several more orificeless bodies by now . Scalpel , please , and an empty iv bag . Empty iv bag ? What exactly are we doing here ? The obvious . Searching for evidence . Any scientific clue to reveal what caused this ... Hear no evil , speak no evil , See no evil malady . The gas trapped within his body May yield important information . Worth the study . Oh , dear god , that is putrid . On a separate topic , do you like coffee cake ? Hey , take a look at this . I , uh , i know someone at the s.E.C. I had her send over a list of every business That jones 's lawyer has incorporated for his clients Over the last three years . Figure maybe one of more of them Are used to funnel cash to the z.F.T. This is all protected by lawyer-Client privilege . How did you get her to break that ? We , uh ... dated in college . And she dumped me , bad , So i told her she owed me one . I-I narrowed down the list to u.S. Addresses only . Good work . It 's no first folio . Some tanning , pretty badly shelf-Cocked . I can give you 40 for it . Okay . You don 't wanna make that deal . First edition land of lahs ? No matter what condition it 's in , It 's worth at least twice that . Thanks . Have a great day . Was that really necessary ? Ah , you know me , markam . Friend of the people . What about me ? Aren 't i people ? People who shower . Huh . Who 's this friend ? Olivia dunham . $ 5.00 i can name at least one item on your night stand , Olivia dunham . Don 't tell me ... You 're gonna like this . I 'm never wrong . It 's a gift . Okay , toni morrison novel , something by obama , And / or the current issue of bon appetit . Uh , i 'm reading advanced forensic science By annemann . I keep it next to my gun . I like this one . This one 's just a friend , and we need a favor . An anonymous , self-Published manuscript . Uh , destruction by advancement of technology . Sounds sexy and very challenging . Peter says you 're good . Well , he also says that you 're just a friend , so ... The book , markam . We need it . Today , right ? Right . Impress me . Nothing interests me less than impressing you . Think i might have something . Warehouse building in austin , Leased to jones ' attorney . Power was cut off for months , Two weeks ago was turned back on . The day jones escaped from prison . Could be a safe house . This is broyles . I need a search warrant authorized . - Sir ... - yeah , a warehouse- - Sir , this can 't wait . - What is it ? - There 's a man downstairs . Says his name is david robert jones . ? ? Jones ! ? ? And he just turned himself in . Two hours ago . Said he 's only speak to agent dunham . Hasn 't said a word since . Anything else ? Anything on how he escaped from prison ? No informati . Just another question . A key . What key ? It was found on him when he turned himself in . There are no markings on it . Forensics is doing their thing . He wanted us to find it . He wants to talk to me . Let me in there . Jones doesn 't get to dictate the terms Of his captivity . He wouldn 't be a captive if it wasn 't der his terms . The only reason jones is here is because he wants to be . Well , that may be the case , but the united states Doesn 't negotiate with terrorists . That 's exactly the kind of arrogance he 's expecting . What did you say ? The man was clever enough to star trek himself Out of a maximum security german prison . Elude inteol , arrive in boston , And get himself apprehended . Simply because he liked the idea . He 's expecting us to reject his request . And your choice is what ? Give jones what he wants To demonstrate that we can be anti-Dogmatic ? I don 't think that 's what you 're saying , Is it , agent dunham ? Since he arrived in town , an innocent man was killed In a shocking and gruesome way . We don 't know that was jones . It was jones , and he has more planned . And you know that how ? I don 't know how to justify a hunch . Sanford , i don 't see any harm- - This isn 't a gentleman 's club , ms . Dunham . Mr. Jones doesn 't just get to choose The pretty one . You wanna get him to talk ? Join the raid on that warehouse in austin . See what you find . - How is that- - - Relevant ? Well , because right now , he 's just an escaped prisoner . But if he 's playing games , as you say , I doubt he 's here to help us . So show some hard evidence That connects him to that incident downtown . Agent dunham . I got it- - The z.F.T. Book . Stop it . Already ? Markam found some guy who collects scientific ephemera . He had a copy in his basement . The thing was never published . It was never even proofed , but check this out . " The advances of science , " Which are supposed to expand " Our knowledge of the universe , " Will , if not carefully controlled , Destroy the world as we know it . " So it 's light reading ? Wait , it gets better . " Our technological hubris ? ? ? ? " The answer , to use a term generally understood " But the specifics of which you cannot imagine " And which this document will attempt to describe Is warfare . " ? Well , keep reading . Will do . Where you headed ? We 're going to raid a building That we think may be a safe house . Alpha team clear . Bravo clear . ? ? He was here . I want everything bagged and tagged ! Move fast ! I 'd like to ask you some questions . Oh , i believe i made myself clear . There is another i wish to speak to . I 'm afraid agent dunham Is preoccupied . So lucky you . You get me . Well , you don 't look well . Which is why i was hoping to speak with agent dunham As soon as possible . I prefer to avoid any additional , Unnecessary deaths . When agent dunham comes to see me , I 'll require the following items . A standard walkie-Talkie with removable crystals , A metallic ballpoint pen , and an eyeglass repair kit . An analog wristwatch . Your watch would do . You sure you don 't need anything else ? Quite sure , yes . Anything ? Nothing criminal . All right , let 's lock it up and get back . What the hell ? I need a med kit ! Now ! Quick , help me hold him . He 's suffocating . I need to trach him . Oh , come on , come on . Okay , breathe . Okay ... he 's breathin No , no , no , no , no ! Uhh ! Ah , god . Where are we ? We 've got audio . Visual coming up right now . Yeah . Move in closer on this . I want to record every twitch . Oh , finally a welcome face . A colleague of mine just died . He was 27 years old . He was due to get married next month . Yes , i tried to prevent that . Your agent harris needed some convincing . Here i am . Have you brought the items i requested ? This will on take a moment . Pull in tighter on this , on the hands . What the hell is he doing ? That 's a $ 1,000 watch . Whoa ! What 's happening in there ? ? Now i 've ... managed to get us some privacy . It 's just you and me now . But we haven 't much time . You were responsible for what happened to thomas avery . Simply the stage setter . An example that doesn 't need to be followed . Well , that implies that you 're planning something else . Something far worse , yes . What is it ? First ... i need your services . What the hell do you want ? I need you to pass a test . Get them out of there . That device he 's made Is blocking our surveillance equipment . He can 't hurt us , sanford . He 's just trying to show you who 's in charge . When i turned myself in , There was a key in my pocket , as i 'm sure you 're aware . Take the key , which i assume is in forensics . Go to the amusement park on policy street in salem . I 've left something there for you . You need medical attention . All the assistance ... In this world ... could not cure me , ms . Dunham . It seems ... That when one is dematerialized On a molecular level and then reassembled , There are certain unadvertised side effects . But who knows ? Perhaps this task i have for you Could lead to something that might help me . Tell me about the attack you 're planning . I wouldn 't call it that . I 'd call it an insurance policy . I don 't care what you call it . Even as we speak , a white cargo van Is transporting an explosive device Capable of killing several hundred people In the manner of the newsman and your affianced agent . ? When is it set to go off ? 16 hours from now . Before anything , you are going to disable that- - No , you are . But first , there 's the matter of the key . That 's enough . I want you out of this room . Don 't worry , ms . Dunham . If i wanted to harm you , i would have . Long ago . Apologies about the watch . Jones is planting a device somewhere Capable of killing more people in the same way That guy from the news stand died . He won 't say where or when . But we need every white van Rented within the last 48 hours Tracked down . In the meantime , i need two hours alone . Why ? Where are you going ? To get a massage . I 'll tell you when i get back . Hey , it 's me . Where are we at ? We know how the folks are ending up faceless . It 's a powdered toxin . It 's absorbed through the skin . It triggers a hyperactivity In the protein responsible for scar tissue . You want any more detail than that ? Uh , not really . Did you hear that jones turned himself in ? Yeah , i did . You get anything ? Yeah , that he 's crazy . And h 's planning on using that toxin again , and soon . How 's walter coming with the antidote ? He 's working on it . He says , and i quote , " It 'll be ready when it 's ready and not a moment before . " Great , anything more in the manuscript That might suggest what jones ' end game is ? Well , it reads like a happy combo Between an anti-Science manifesto And a call to arms . Call to arms against whom ? Exactly . I 'll call you back when i get to the good part . Yeah , please do . Maybe it 'll help us figure out Where this next attack is gonna be . ? ? - Was that olivia ? - Yeah . Where 's the manuscript ? Is she bringing coffee cake ? No , she 's not getting food . Have you seen the manuscript that i was reading earlier ? 'S ... fascinating , isn 't it ? I was just reading it whilst sitting on the crapper . Please , no more information than that . - Can i have it back ? - I must read you one excerpt . Great , well , grab the blanket . It 's nap time . ? " ? Our universe is one of many . " The unknown truth is that the way to travel Etween them has already been discovered " By beings much like us , " But whose history is slightly ahead of our own . " The negative effects of such visitation " Will be irreversible both to our world and to theirs . ? " Unquantifiable , at first ... " But growing , not unlike a cancer , Until a simple fact Becomes undeniable . " Only one world will survive . It will either be us or them . " Miss dunham , i know how this appears . That i 've sent you quite a distance To pick up a child 's board game . " But what i 've hidden here is not a game at all . " You 're holding an evaluation system , " A series of tests designed to cultivate " Specific , innate skills present in particular individuals . " Do the first test only . " Complete it successfully , and come back to see me . Do this , and no one else will die . " I got the instructions . So jones is threatening to kill hundreds of people Unless i take a test . No , unless you pass a test . ? Tough to do with jones killing innocent people . In a word , insanity . You can 't pose rational questions When you 're dealing with a guy like jones . Indeed . And whatever mr . Jones' true goal may be , We only have eight hours left until his next attack . Test one ... of ten , by the way . Turn switch on . The recruit sits no more than 24 inches from the device But cannot touch the light board . Recruit focuses on light board . The object of the test is to systemically Shut down the lights so that ultimately none are flashing . How ? Using all your magic powers , i guess . Curious . The instructions refer to the recruit . The author ... uses the same term . " Many warriors of the inevitable confrontation " Are among us now . " But before they can be considered soldiers , " They must be regarded as recruits . " And the expectation must be That they shall be unwilling . " So i 'm supposed to just Turn these lights off by looking at them . Well , it wouldn 't be much of a test If we could just take out the battery . Fine . Dunham . We just got a hit . Steady car rentals in new haven Leased a white van yesterday morning ... ? To one olivia dunham . No . Oh , yeahhe 's messing with you , liv . Got local police scouring the area . So far , no luck . Thanks , charlie . This is just a stupid mind game . Where you going ? To end it . I will not let him use that device again . If you 're gonna meet with jones , I want full surveillance this time . Sir , the last time you got your way , We lost a good agent . Do you really want to get in the way again ? We have less than seven hours Before something truly horrific will happen . Something that i 'm trying to stop . For some reason , jones is out to get me . So sir , would you please let me handle this ? - I got your test kit . - You didn 't bring it ? No , i didn 't need to , 'cause this is- - Your reluctance is to be expected . I know what you 're doing , mr . Jones . I 'm trying to get you to pass test number one . I know about the manuscript . The manifesto , z.F.T. I know that you believe that there 's some kind of war coming . You read it ? And that you 're recruiting warriors . That 's the word you used , isn 't it ? You don 't believe you 're worthy ? I believe that everybody , maybe even you , But somehow , you got me into your head . Somehow . Yes . You 're among those treated with cortexiphan . It 's why we had you taken . We needed confirmation . Something which requires a spinal tap . E next step , had you not escaped , Was to convince you of this . I have ever been treated with cortexiphan . I haven 't even heard of it . You wouldn 't have . Well , i don 't believe you , mr . Jones . What i believe is that you 've created some ridiculous scenario Where people 's lives rely on me attempting and failing What is obviously an impossible task . The task is hardly impossible ! I will not let these people die Because of some stupid game that you 're playing . This is no game ! You need to cooperate , mr . Jones . No , ms . Dunham ! It is you who needs to cooperate ! Mr. Jones ? Pulse is slowing down to 50 beats per minute . Get him up there . Astrid , set up the ekg ! Is this the patient ? Walter , put the cow away , would you ? What is this place ? It 's a freak show . Thanks for your help . Thank you . It 's haening quicker than i would have imagined . What 's happening ? You understand , this man teleported through space . His molecules disintegrating and reintegrating . The very implications of it- - We need a video camera . We should record this . Walter , this man is our only chance To stop a device that could kill a lot of innocent people . I need you to stabilize him . Of course . Okay . Point taken . I 'll do a thorough exam . Meanwhile , get me 50ccs of saline , please . Hey , astrid , do you mind ? Sure . ? Why am i not surprised ? Thanks , charlie . Anything ? ? Cortexiphan . It 's a drug patented but not approved by the fda . Patented to whom ? To massive dynamic . Why am i not surprised ? That 's what i just said . Jones ? Walter 's replenishing his fluids right now . But he 's still gonna have to give him a full exam Before we even know if we can wake him back up . Look , i 'm gonna go find out what i can About cortexiphan , but in the meantime , He 's actually expecting me to be able to do it . To do what ? Test number one . The flashing lights . Jones won 't cooperate unless i pass the test . You think we can trick him ? What are you asking me to do ? You want me to open up the light box ? You could see what you could do . Thank you so much for seeing me at such short notice . As i said , i am always available to you , olivia . What can i do ? I need information on a drug called cortexiphan . ? Is everything I right ? My hand , it 's been acting up . I need to have it looked at . Oh , yes , i recall this . Cortexiphan . It was part of a clinical trial Of a drug that dr . Bell created in ' 81 . What is it ? If you don 't mind . Dr. Bell theorized that the human mind at birth Is infinitely capable , And that every force it encounters- - Social , physical , intellectual- - Is the beginning of the process he referred to As limitation , A diminishing of that potential . And cortexiphan ? It was meant to limit that limitation To prevent the natural shrinking Of that brain power . - To prevent , not undo ? - Meaning ... That the drug was administered to children ? Yes . The drugs were extensively animal tested . They were harmless to the children who received them . Unfortunately , they were also unsuccessful . So dr . Bell abandoned his research on cortexiphan In 1983 . Were their trials ? Dr. Bell conducted the ials himself At ohio state university , wooster campus . Nowhere else ? No . Why ? ? Nothing . That 's good to know . No matter what jones believes , i was never given that drug . William bell conducted his trials in ohio . In 1981 , i was three , living in jacksonville , florida . My dad was stationed at the naval base there . ? In other news , Walter thinks he 's gonna be able to revive jones soon . And i was able to reprogram the light box . We should be able to fake jones out . ? If there 's cardiac arrest , we 'll need nitroglycerin . Peter , prepare- - Mr. Jones , we have two hours Before your planned attack hits . And i think i 've passed test number one . Dr. Bishop ... Without your extraordinary work , I wouldn 't have the pleasure of making your acquaintance . I locked the teleporter away for a reason . One of which you are now experiencing . Nevertheless ... It is an honor . Jones , i pass the test ... You tell us everything we need In order to stop whatever it is you 're planning . That was always the deal . Well done , ms . Dunham . Thank you . Your turn . Indeed . 923 church street . The 47th floor . You better hurry . This is agent dunham . I need immediate evac . 923 church street . There 's a device on the 47th floor . Nicely done . Good performance . I need these streets cleared now ! Anyone within a four-Block radius has to move ! Go ! Double-Time ! Hey , where are we ? Building 's about 70 % clear . We lucked out . They 're undergoing renovation , So not all the floors are occupied . So the device ... This one 's a real mess . Bomb squad said they can 't move it or diffuse it . Why ? Because they 've never seen wiring like this before . Oh , my god . It 's rigged here for a reason : To blow out the windows . Four blocks ain 't gonna cut it . Not even close . I 'm on it . Contact the weather service . We need to map the fallout pattern . I 'm on it . Agent farnsworth . Hey , it 's me . That son of a bitch knew what we were doing . - What ? - He knew that we were faking him out . Is he still conscious ? Barely . Put him on . It 's dunham . Hello , you . I can 't do this . I remain confident that you can . Look , you know what i did before , it wasn 't al . Yes ... i ow , ms . Dunham . Before they can be considered soldiers , They must be regarded as recruits , And the expectation must be that they shall be unwilling . Mr. Jones , i am willing . I am willing , but i am not able . Olivia , we gotta go . There 's only one way To disable that device . You know what that is . Okay . You think that i 'm valuable . Valuable enough to kidnap , to try and train . You are a rare commodity , true . Okay ... If you don 't deactivate this device , i 'm gonna die . Which means that your rare commodity is gone . But i have one thing , ms . Dunham , That you do not . I have faith in you . There is no red wire , no blue . Only black . Cut any one of them , and the device blows . Try and remove it , and the device blows . If those lights are flashing when the timer reaches zero , The device blows . There is only one way out . And it 's you . Okay , we need to get these people out of here . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Where are you going ? Olivia , we gotta go . What did jones say ? - Olivia ... - I need to do this . There is no other way . If you stay here , you are going to die . I 'm not doing this with you , olivia . ? You did it . What was that ? How did you do that ? I don 't know . Farnsworth . Yes , sir . Thank you . We--We will . Wait ... wait , wait , wait . She did it , didn 't she ? It seems she did . My girl . You okay ? I didn 't do anything . With those lights , they ... he planned it . Jones , it was all just a mind game . How did he plan it ? Plan what ? They were programmed to turn off when the countdown ended . Maybe , but ... he couldn 't have known When you were gonna arrive . He couldn 't have known the timing on that . Well , that 's what he did . Look , i 'm the last person to subscribe to this kind of stuff , But you were in the zone out there tonight , olivia . The way you stared down that light box Was like nothing i 've ever seen before . It wasn 't me . Fine , then , let me play devil 's advocate . Why did jones choose you at all ? Because of your father . He wanted to meet your father . He wanted to meet the man Who designed the device That let him escape from prison . And you think that 's what all this was about ? Okay ... fine . Look , all i know is i didn 't die tonight . So i 'm pretty much willing to accept any explanation You wanna give . You wanna go get a drink ? Or five ? I 've seen you with a whisky bottle . Jones was just transferred to boston general , so ... I have a few questions for him . It 's my last chce . Yeah . So in all the excitement of today , I forgot to say something . I haven 't overlooked the fact That you actually created a teleportation machine . Well ... I suppose i did . Which , despite the fact that using it kills you , Is ... pretty damn cool . Kills you ? It does something unthinkable , but ... It doesn 't kill you . Hello . Agent dunham ? Nina sharp . Hand 's back to normal . Well , good for you . I was curious about that question you asked . Whether there were other places Where cortexiphan was tested . Yes ? There was , it turns out , A second clinical trial . Though much smaller than the one in oh . There was ? Yes , in jacksonville , florida . At a military base . Agent dunham ? Thank you very much for calling . U 're most welcome . Have a good night .

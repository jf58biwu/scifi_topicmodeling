 Previously on Heroes . I have no idea how you 're pulling this off , but I swear to God , I 'm not gonna stop until I figure it out , you understand me ? I 'm just trying to figure out how to take care of our family . I don 't have a job , Jan. They 're gonna pay for what they did to me , what they did to us . There is no putting this whole thing behind you . We 've got to find out what they did and make them fix it . You wanted to know why I was invisible all these years ? It was because of them . And you 've brought the bastards right to my door . Tell me , Claire , can you keep a secret ? I think I know how I survived that fire . Please say something . Some family . That 's how I survived it . Your mother has a subdural hemorrhage . It 's like a bruise on her brain , specifically the area that controls memory . You erased her mind . Claire , that 's ridiculous . You tried to erase mine . What you know is dangerous . Why did you do this to Mom ? I only wanted to protect my family . I think we 've had enough of that . No . Don 't . Don 't ! I 'm not gonna nuke the dog . I wouldn 't hurt Mr. Muggles , would I ? You know what ? If you want to hurt this guy , that 'd be the way to do it . There are more pictures of dogs around here than there are of his kids . You don 't really think that he 's stupid and / or sloppy enough to leave incriminating evidence around the house ? I mean , he did just get raided by the FBI . We couldn 't get a warrant for the house , so in the off chance that he is a little sloppy or stupid , I 'm gonna poke around . So now we 're jacking his computer ? You want to sit around all day and download files ? I don 't . If we don 't find anything on his PC , there is somewhere else we can look . Inside his head ! I plan on that . We 're gonna bag this smug son of a bitch and his paper factory . Let 's see how he likes it . Maybe we can bag him here . Oh , God , he 's with his family . Family is a pretty good motivator . No , no , I am not taking any hostages . We bag him at the paper factory . Wait. no , no , that was Plan A. Plan B is much better . There is no Plan B. We leave now . How many times are you gonna let this guy slip through your fingers ? Lyle , help your mother . Claire , talk to me . What 's the point ? Am I even going to remember this conversation ? Would you keep your voice down ? Lyle ! Take your mother , get out of the house , right now ! I 'm sure you have a lot of questions . We all do . Honey , what 's happening ? Yeah , Dad , what 's happening ? Stay calm . Yeah . Yeah , let 's just , everyone , stay calm . Okay ? Everyone stays calm , nobody 's gonna get hurt . This is Officer Parkman of the LAPD . Formerly of the LAPD , thanks to you . What do you want from me ? You come into my house with guns ? Not guns , gun . I don 't need a gun , do I , Mr. Bennet ? Not after what you did to me . I don 't know you . You insist on lying , you 're gonna upset me . You know what happens when I get upset . I get very bright and very hot . Well , no , Ted is gonna do us all a favor . Right , Ted ? And he 's not gonna get upset , but you 've got to help . I 'm not who you think I am . I 'm just a paper salesman . No . No . You 're not . So , tell me , how do you feel about paper ? Wildly enthusiastic . Good , because as far as friends and family are concerned , it 's your life . Congratulations , you are the new regional manager for Primatech Paper . Nice cover . Sorry to make a liar out of you , but it 's part and parcel of what we do . Nobody outside the organization knows . Well , they can 't know . People are fragile , like teacups . All around them , the world is changing , and they simply don 't want to deal with it . They don 't want to know what 's happening to us as a species . And they certainly don 't want to know the measures we take to keep them safe . Now , you 'll be asked to do things that fall in the morally gray territory . Things that most would find cruel , but men like you and I know to be necessary . I 'm comfortable with morally gray . Good . You will have a partner , one of them . That 's how we do it here , keeps us all honest . Great , when do I meet him ? He 's already here . Is this a test ? Oh , shoot ! How did you ... How is that ... It 's a brave new world , friend . Go ahead , tell them what you do . What goes on at that paper factory of yours , Mr. Bennet ? He abducts people . He drugs us . He injects us with I don 't know what . I lost my job . And I am trying not to lose my wife . But you don 't care about that , do you ? You don 't care about what you did to me . All you care about is that we think that nothing happened . Makes us forget . How can he make you forget ? The Haitian . That 's right , the Haitian . She knows ? This is your fault . She knows this is his fault . He 's got them all fooled , except for her . Just when you thought plausible deniability was gonna save your ass . The Haitian . He made my mother forget . The Haitian . He made her mother forget , and her brother , but not ... Why didn 't he make you forget ? What is he talking about , Claire ? I don 't know anything . You want to put a stop to all this ? All you need to do to keep your family safe , to keep us all safe , is just tell the truth ! I am telling the truth . No , this is the truth . Oh , my God . This is what you did to me . Settle down , Ted . We just want to be normal again . He 's not a paper salesman . Guess she 's not Daddy 's little girl anymore . What are they doing ? Claire ! He 's getting inside your daughter 's head . I can run . Get some help . They can 't hurt me . I know you 're thinking about being a hero . Don 't . Don 't . This guy is serious and he 's really dangerous , and I need your help to make sure that nobody gets hurt . You can read my mind ? Yeah , that 's something your dad did to me . It didn 't just happen ? I wouldn 't be here right now if it just happened . Has my dad done this to other people ? Yeah , as far as I can tell . It 's different with everyone . I 've seen some weird things . I 'm sure you have , too , like that stuff at your school . Peter Petrelli . Peter Petrelli ? He can do what I can do . What do you know about him ? He can do what I can do . He 's different . Like you . " Save the cheerleader . " I read his mind . He read mine . He told me to protect you from someone who was killing people like me . Are you different , Claire ? Your blood was all over that crime scene . You didn 't have a scratch on you . Why didn 't you have a scratch on you ? I can heal . Did my dad make me this way ? What are they gonna do with the baby ? I don 't know . I wonder if they knew about little orphan Annie before they sent us over there to bag a bloody fire starter . Nah . They would have told us . Claude , a word , please . Hiro . Did you make me this way ? Is that why you adopted me ? Am I some sort of experiment ? Don 't talk to your father like that . He 's not my father . They have nothing to do with this . He 's the one who got them involved . No , we did , you and me . When we didn 't leave this house when they came home . Look , no one 's been hurt yet . What 's he gonna do ? Go to the police ? We can get out of here , right now . We didn 't get what we came for . We came for a cure . And what if there isn 't one ? I 'll kill us all . Just get inside his head and get some answers , or we 're all gonna have a really bad day . That son of a bitch is thinking in Japanese . Why are you thinking in Japanese , huh ? We want answers . Who are you ? And what did you do to us ? In the den , the safe in the bookcase . Ted , there 's a safe in the bookcase . No ! Oh ! Stop it . Stop it ! Enough ! We 're done . We are not done ! I 'm calling your bluff . Mom ? Ted , Ted ! Put the gun down . That 's not gonna help anybody . Well , he killed my wife . Only fair I kill his . And with his own gun , too . Kind of poetic , don 't you think ? Tell him what he wants to know ! Come on ! He 's willing to kill us all . Leave her alone . She didn 't do anything . Claire , sit down . Shoot me , if you 're gonna shoot someone . No ! Parkman , you have to trust me . Shoot Claire . I 'm telling you , someone 's gonna die . I 'm sorry , Mrs. Bennet . Shoot Claire now . She can heal . Shoot me ! You brought this on yourself . No ! No , no , no , Claire . Claire ! What did you do ? No , no , no , Claire . What did you do ? What did you do that for ? Get his trust . Now he knows how far we 'll go . Right hook . Right hook coming . Bastard ! You killed my little girl ! You , you did ! No ! Tell me it 's not true . Tell me ... Don 't leave her here ! Move Claire 's body before she heals . They don 't need to see here like this . We 've got to move the body . I had no idea it was going to go this far . Believe me , he was going to kill your wife . I actually heard him pull the trigger in his mind . Thank you for shooting first . Oh , my God . Where 's Mom and Lyle ? Downstairs . Are they safe ? No . Wait , you made her indestructible ? I didn 't make anyone . You don 't have all your facts straight , and I don 't appreciate your confusing my daughter . The facts are you work at some freak factory where you ruin people 's lives . You 've been misled , Claire . I will explain everything later , but right now , you have to do exactly what I tell you to do . I 'm going to the police . No , no , wait , wait . Do not make the same mistake I did . Don 't put your family at risk . Parkman ? Yeah , coming ! The people I work for don 't know about you . If they did , you wouldn 't be here right now . They would have taken you months ago , and we never would have seen you again . You say you want a normal life , that 's what I 've been fighting for . He 's telling the truth . Hate me all you want , but right now , this has to be contained , which means you have to stay put . What ? You want me to play dead ? I 'm sorry , I 'm not Mr. Muggles . That man downstairs can generate a chain reaction , which would be like dropping a nuclear bomb on this house . And he 'll do it , too . Come on , we got to go now . Right . Just do what I say , so nobody gets hurt . And you . Yeah ? Do what I think . Hey ! Hey , enough ! God ! No ! Enough ! We already got their attention . We 're not gonna find anything here . What we want is at the paper factory . Really ? Yeah . He tell you that , or think it ? They 've got records of the abductions , what they 've done . In exchange for his family 's safety , he 'll get them for us . I don 't want anybody else to die because of what I 've done to you . Why do all words coming out of your mouth sound like lies ? He 's not lying . We 'll have proof . No surprises at the factory ? Just the truth . I 'll stay with the family . You go . No . I 'll stay with the family . I can do more damage here . Whatever you say . You 're in control . Sandra ... I 'm gonna get us out of this . All right , it 's 7 : 00 a. m . If you 're not back in an hour , look for the mushroom cloud . I think my wife suspects something . She went through my bag . She found a gun and a sedation kit . That 's a particular kind of stupid on your part , letting her find them . I know . The baby 's been keeping me up for days . It was sloppy . I think Sandra thinks I 'm some sort of a serial killer . She 's better off thinking you 're a serial killer than knowing the truth . I don 't know what to do . That a new sensation for you , Bennet ? Is my wife in danger ? If I said yes , what would be your next move ? Would you pack up Sandra and little Claire and make a run for it ? Or would you turn her over ? I 'd do what I 've always done , what I 'm told . But you didn 't answer the question . Is she in danger ? Relax . Nothing 's gonna happen to your wife , because she 's not gonna remember finding anything . There 's a boy we discovered in Haiti . He can make her forget ? He 's really something . He 's mute . When we asked him to describe his ability , he drew a picture of himself pulling memories like little grub worms out of someone 's head . I wanted to put it on the front of my fridge . When he 's done , make sure you thank him for saving Sandra 's life . She 's upstairs . We don 't have time for this . In about 38 minutes , Ted 's going nuclear unless we bring him back some hard evidence . The only thing we 're bringing Ted is a tranquilizer . He deserves to know the truth . He doesn 't want the truth . He wants his wife back . Short of that , he wants revenge of the good old-fashioned biblical variety . No , actually , he doesn 't ... You said yourself , he 'd already pulled the trigger in his mind . Okay , so that 's it for him . What about me ? Huh ? Are you gonna send me back to LA with my wife and baby and no idea that this ever happened so you can pretend to have a happy family again ? I 'm not sending you anywhere . You 're the only one I can trust . Look , here 's the deal . I 'll be honest with you . You be honest with me . You just try lying to me . I just signaled the Haitian . You said no one would know we 're here . Until I needed them to . Guess who found out where I live . What do you think we should do with him ? But first I have another " guess who " . Guess who found out you can talk ? Who have you been talking to ? Who else knows about Claire ? Just her and I , but that will change . She wasn 't supposed to remember any of this . I gave you specific instructions . I answer to someone whose instructions supersede yours . In this company ? In your daughter 's life . What 's the mission ? Looking into a security breach . That 's all I know . That 's all they told me . That 's all they told you to tell me , but what you know is considerably more . You 're not as good a liar as you think . You 're the security breach . Is that what they 're calling me behind my back ? I was hoping for something a bit more subtle , or a pun at least . You Americans are usually good for a pun . Is it true ? Are you hiding one of them ? By " them " you mean people like me ? Is that who you 're accusing me of hiding ? Well , the short answer 's yes , isn 't it ? You compromised what we 're doing . Sorry . I mean , I know we 're serving the greater good , but the vivisection started to keep me up at night . Seeing as you 're raising one of us as your own , I was hoping for a bit more sympathy . Claire 's not one of you . Not yet , but one day , maybe . And don 't tell me you haven 't thought about it . If she is , then they 'll take her , and it 's done . Oh , just like that ? Father of the year , you are . I know who I work for . So do I. I was in your office when they told you to kill me . Then why 'd you get in the car ? Evidently I think you 're a better man than they do . Get out . It 's not the first time you 've been told to kill a man , but is it the first time you 've been told to kill a friend ? Tell me who it is , and we can forget about the rest . You 're just gonna do it ? You 're just gonna off me like nothing ? It 's not nothing ! We find these people , that 's what we do , and you buried one . You acted against the interest of the company . Have you ever stopped to think what those interests are ? Who is it ? And what if it was Claire ? That 's why you 're so distant from her . You know you 're gonna turn her in . You 're preparing for it . You used to believe in what we do . I used to believe in the tooth fairy . We made a promise , both of us . I will not hunt my own people . This isn 't who you are . You have a choice ... Why couldn 't you just ... She 's my daughter . You can 't be trusted to put her safety before company interests . I 've been hiding her for months . That 's the sort of thing that will get you killed , by someone like you , but it hasn 't made your daughter any safer . We 're running out of time , and we 're not exactly dealing with a patient man . All right , look , it 's in Claire 's best interest that we contain this and we keep her off the radar . She could run . She 's safer in plain sight . Not at the moment . No one is going to be safe unless you give Ted what he wants . Claire . God . Thank you . Thank you , God . I prayed so hard . Thank you . Thank you , God . For you , I prayed so hard , and you came back . You 're an angel . You must be here . Where did you go ? Go , hurry . Run . Get out of here ! Lyle , go to the back ! Run ! Mom ! Claire ! No ! Lyle , get out of here . Run ! Mom ! Go ! Claire . Go , Mom ! Mom ! Claire ! You should have run . I could never leave you , not after I just got you back . I always thought you were a miracle . Didn 't know how much of one till now . I 'm not a miracle , Mom . You were dead . Anytime someone rises from the dead , I 'd say that 's a miracle . I don 't know what I am . I don 't know if God made me this way , or someone else . God didn 't make us this way . God makes us all the way we are . " I walked through fire and didn 't get burned , " you were trying to tell me . I was trying not to tell you . All this forgetting , why I was in the hospital , you think your father did that to me ? I know he did . He said he was trying to protect us . He 's your father . He is coming back to get us out of this . He 's lied to you your entire marriage . What makes you so sure he 'd keep his word now ? Faith . What I 've seen . What I 've witnessed . I can 't pretend it 's the same world it was yesterday . God gave you a second chance . Find it in your heart to give your father one . I 'm curious about something . Did Parkman know when he shot you that you wouldn 't die ? Did your dad tell him that ? I don 't know . That explains why they were so chummy when they came down the stairs . What do you suppose they 're up to ? Guess I 'll just ask them myself . Am I still in control , Mr. Bennet ? You 're still in control , Ted . No tricks , just what you asked for , the truth . We have what we want , Ted . We have the proof . Then why the theatrics with shooting the girl who can 't die ? It 's better than shooting one that can . We didn 't come here to hurt anyone . If the people who I work for find out that I 've shown this to you , they will kill me . Since I 'm risking my own life , I would rather not risk my family 's . Do you want revenge , or do you want the truth ? You can 't have both . I want the truth . Then let them go . Get them out of here . What is he doing here ? Just making sure my family is safe , that 's all . Go . Go . Go . Come on . Come on . Go . No , you stay . They can go . Dad . Get out . Go ! Come on , Claire . Let 's go . Come on . Come on . Lyle ! Mom ! I called the police . We didn 't make you this way . We took you three months ago to identify you . At the time you were giving off low levels of radiation . You were harmless . And you did nothing to stop it . There 's no cure . We can 't change the way you are . The only choice is to kill you . I wish you had . It was my call . You had a life . Who was I to take it from you ? Because you let me go , my wife is dead . I 'm sorry . So am I. No ! Don 't ! You 'll set him off ! You gotta stop it ! Stop ! Make it stop ! I can 't ! We 've got to get out of here ! No ! Dad . Claire ! Where 's my dad ? He 's ... Claire , don 't ! Dad ! Get out ! Not without you ! Tranquilizer . Stay down ! I can 't get close enough . Give it to me ! No ! I 'll be okay ! Hey ! Hey ! Get him out of here . Go ! Go ! Fine . Go ! Go ! Claire ! It 's a good thing you called me when you did . This sort of thing isn 't taken lightly . You know well and good what the policy is on hiding them . I 'm well aware . It 's a shame that I have to kill another partner , especially one so useful to the cause . Has he been located ? The Haitian ? Nah . He must have figured you 'd turn him in . How long was he hiding Claire ? In plain sight , too , you must feel like a fool . I take it it 's been months . She trusted him over her own father . Surrogate father . Now that we have him , we 'll keep Sprague sedated . Find out what gives him his spark . And then ? What do you think ? He was very helpful . Imagine working with someone like Parkman by your side , knowing what everyone around you is thinking . Could prove quite resourceful . Certainly keep everybody honest . She one of them ? Very promising . She 's gonna help us clean up the mess you made . We done here ? Just one more thing . When should we be expecting Claire ? I 'll bring her in now . Where am I going ? I don 't know . Will I see you again ? Mom ? Lyle ? I don 't know . I wanted to protect you . You 're my dad . I tried to be the best dad I could . I know . Let 's see ? Those are grandpa glasses . Ouch . Ouch . Even though I am the same age my father was when he needed glasses . All right , how about these ? Huh ? What ? Grandma glasses . Am I gonna need glasses , too ? I don 't know . Well , if you needed them , and Grandpa needed them , won 't I need them ? Your mother and I were wondering when we were going to have this conversation . What 's wrong ? No , no , nothing 's wrong . Tell me . I 'm not your biological father . You 're adopted . Then who are my real parents ? We 're your real parents . We don 't know who your biological family is , but we 're your real family . How can you be my real family if I 'm adopted ? Well , what makes us real isn 't where you come from , it 's how much we love you . And we love you very much . I love you very much . You didn 't grow inside your mother , you grew inside our hearts . Claire . Talk to me . Try these on . How do I look ? Like my dad . This is goodbye . You don 't have to do this . There 's got to be another way . This is the best way . There can 't be any doubt cast on your father . Right here . Two inches higher , and I 'm dead . Claire , turn around . Cover your ears . Dad ? God . Go deep . Take anything that would lead them to her . I love you , Dad . I love you , Claire-Bear .

A lot of the people we encounter Aren 't in control of their ability . But we need you out there , Doing the good work that you do Helping others like her . you were with a boy . There 's no boy , dad . I tried out for cheerleading . But you promise me that you won 't date . Okay . I painted that , But all the street signs are in french . It could be montreal . Ricky ! The woman who did this to Ricky , She was looking for me . Subtitle Added By MohammaD [ shock ] Season 2 , Episode 6 [ The Line ] I 'm so sorry . I shouldn 't have let him cover for me . It was his choice , Peter . My brother could be a right fool sometimes . The woman who killed ricky , She was looking for me . You saw what she could do . I 'm not gonna let you be next . I 'm gonna find her , Find out who she is , what she wants . How are you planning on doing that ? The plane ticket , the painting . It all points to montreal . It 's a start . I 'm going with you . No . I 'm not risking your life too . We were both in that montreal painting . I think i 'm supposed to go with you , peter . Besides , when you find ricky 's killer , I want to be there . What for ? To kill the bitch . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ... R-E-C-Y-C-L-E ! 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ... It 's our planet , let 's plant a tree ! Whoo ! Go , costa verde ! Stop , please ! I can 't take it anymore . Do you realize how agonizing it is To watch you people ? It 's a no on all three . Next ! Are you crazy ? Claire was awesome . I vote yes . Okay , that 's one vote For claire . Anyone else Care to climb out on a limb with may ? Like i said , Next ! Thanks for trying . Claire , you were amazing . Really . I don 't know what debbie 's thinking . What i 'm thinking is that costa verde high Deserves cheerleaders that are extra-Ordinary . And you , claire , Are simply not extra-Ordinary . How was that ? Perfect yet again . How much longer are we gonna do this ? It 's been hours . I want to go home . Soon , i promise . Let 's take a break . Are you ever gonna tell me what 's going on here ? Where are we ? I mean , you just grabbed me off the street- - You 're in hartsdale , new york , At a privately funded company Whose sole purpose is to help you And others like you . Others like me ? Not exactly like you . Others have different gifts , But you 're the first we 've met With adoptive muscle memory . So that 's what it 's called . Why is this happening to me ? We 're not really sure . There are certain genetic markers , But where they come from is still a mystery . You have been given an extraordinary gift . i agree . You are a very special person , miss dawson . Who are you ? My name is bob . I 'm in charge of operations . Doctor , Could i see you for a moment ? Have you established a reliable baseline For miss dawson 's ability ? Yes . She is able to replicate any action . It 's really quite extraordinary . Good . Now , We could determine If this stops all of that . What is that ? A variant of the shanti virus . You 're experimenting with the virus ? Manipulating a live virus Is essential for creating a vaccine , doctor . We hope to use this virus To take away monica 's ability Without harming her . You could create an incurable strain . It could cross over to the general population . Think how many people were killed by gabriel gray . There are some abilities in this world That must be stopped at any cost . Monica is a sweet girl who loves her abilities . We can 't just take them away from her . It 's for the greater good . So she 's a lab rat . You 're just going to inject her without her consent . No , dr . Suresh , you are . It 's a mutated strain , manufactured . If the biological structure of the virus has been altered , I don 't know if i can save her . She could die . You 're just gonna have to take that chance . I never agreed to experiment on people . You brought them molly , didn 't you ? I didn 't know what else to do . all right , look . If you refuse to do this , They 're gonna get rid of you , And then we 're gonna lose Everything that we 've been trying to do . And worse yet , you 're gonna lose molly . Now you 've got principles , and that 's fine . But to bring down this company , Sometimes we have to do bad things . Don 't disappoint me , suresh . ivan . Something wrong ? I lied to my dad . The other night when i went home , I told him i 'd joined cheerleading . Cheerleading ? That is bad . You don 't understand . Cheerleading tryouts were last period . I didn 't make it . What am i supposed to tell him ? You met this awesome guy , And you need some free time to make out . I told you my dad 's really overprotective About the whole dating thing . He told me i couldn 't date until i was 21 . So ? So i have to listen to my parents . Don 't you ? Claire , i can fly . It kind of makes the whole parental guidance thing A non-Issue . But if it 's that important to you , We 'll figure out a way to get you on the team . It 's impossible . Debbie marshall does not deem me extra-Ordinary enough . Oh , that 's ridiculous . You 're a total babe , and you have a power . By definition , you 're better than she is . Oh , you 're sweet . But it 's not just her . She 's got that whole squad Wrapped around her evil little pinky . I knew girls just like her at my old school . All would take is one person to stand up to her . Well , be that person . Take her down a notch . How ? You were a cheerleader . What do they fear most ? Public humiliation ? We could give her a taste of her own medicine . Your ability is fascinating . A gift . What i do is terrible . I have taken many lives , And i can 't control it . I was like you . I could do things , amazing things . You ? Like what ? I could move objects with my mind . I could hear a pin drop from miles away . But then it all just ... Went away . That 's why i need to see dr . Suresh , To get them back . You want to be different ? I want to be special , Unique . An ability doesn 't have to be a burden , maya . It can be wonderful . Is there a problem ? My brother wants to hire a coyote , To cross the border without you . Why ? You can 't trust them . It 's okay . We 'll cross the border together . I 'm glad to have found you , gabriel . isaac mendez ... Painted a series of eight paintings Beginning with kaito nakamura 's death And ending in mine . Where are they ? Sorry , i 'm retired . I work in the textile factory now . Regional manager of sales , Like you in the paper company . Cut the crap . Where are the paintings ? You think you intimidate me ? I trained you , You and your invisible partner claude . I taught you everything ! Then you know what i 'm capable of . Don 't make me do this . What is this ? You want information ? The haitian can 't help you . My friend has a new trick . He can reach inside that company-Loving head of yours And one by one , blot out all the memories You hold most dear . Think about it , A man of your advanced years . Treasured memories give your life meaning . Your wedding in capri . The births of andre and mikhail . It 'd be a shame if they disappeared , Lost forever . Start with the day he met his wife . Tell me about katarina . Your honeymoon . Her favorite flower . I can 't remember . Really ? After 35 years together , such a shame . Are you ready to talk , Or do we keep going ? Hi , honey . Is everything all right ? Hey , dad , yeah . I was just wondering if i could borrow the car tonight . Did you ask your mother ? i did , and she said to ask you . I 'm gonna be with the cheerleaders later . Just thought you should know . Full disclosure and all . Well , that 's very responsible of you , claire . Take the car . But do one thing for me . Sure . Lock the doors this time . I will . Thanks . Is there something else ? Where are you right now ? I told you . Management training in tulsa . And i 'm late for a session . Well , i thought you had to work there a year Before they 'd send you . I 'm a quick learner . I 've gotta go . I love you , claire-Bear . I love you too , dad . What do you think ? Okay . I 'm in . Your daughter claire ? It must be very difficult for her , The constant fear of discovery , Especially for a teenager . Aren 't you tired of running ? I 'm protecting her from animals like you . You can 't hide forever . Take all his memories of me , my family , Claire , everything i ever told him . He remembers nothing ! Wait ! I 'm like you . Family comes first . Maybe we can make a deal . What kind of deal ? You were my protege , So dedicated to the company , you made me proud . I miss that . I want you back . Forget it . The company has changed . We have new directives . Come back to us and you 'll be safe , All of you . You have my word . What about the paintings ? You 'll be told everything . I can give you your life back . Trust me . What is that ? A border fence , not finished yet . That is america right there . attention , you 're in violation of u.S. Immigration ! We have notified border patrol . All right , boys , andale , andale . Let 's see them hands . Who are they ? They 're locals , not border patrol . They 're fake police . Just drive around them . What 's--What 's that for ? A cholinergic . It 's standard procedure To see if your ability improves . Uh-Uh , no way . I won 't do needles . It 's the last phase of your testing . One shot , you can go home . Fine . Just make it fast . I can 't do this . Dr. Suresh ? I won 't do it . If you don 't , someone else will . And there 's more where that came from . Stop ! What are you doing ? ! Get someone else to do your research . I 'm taking molly , and i 'm leaving . All right , boys , this is your last warning . Vamanos . We have to go . They will shoot us . Just drive , now ! No , no , no , no , no . Let her alone . We need to get past these men , These guns . You can use your gift . No . Drive . The next time you think Of that second helping of chunky monkey , Remember one thing . The sharpie doesn 't lie .

Cheerleaders only . I 'll do your biology homework for a week . You have five minutes . i want another chance , Another shot at tryouts . I appreciate the effort , really . Attempting to better your social status at school Is very american dream of you . But everyone has their place in this world . Deal with it . So you 're not gonna change your mind ? You are slow , aren 't you ? Claire ? Claire ? ! Oh , my god . She was right there . Her neck was twisted . She was bleeding . I went to see if i could help her , And that 's when he came after me . The flying masked man ? Yes ! I escaped , thank goodness , But claire was dead , Right there on the steps . I saw her . She 's- - What 's going on ? But i saw you . That thing dropped you . Debbie , calm down . I 'm fine . I don 't supposed you saw a ... Flying masked man this evening ? Me ? No . No . Uh , i was just hanging out with debbie . find anything , ray ? No dead bodies . I did find this . How much have you had to drink tonight , miss marshall ? We don 't have much time . The sun will rise soon . Yaeko 's father is there . You take out the guard , we will follow . You 've given me purpose , carp . I 'm really a hero . And more , you 've made me a better man . Well ... You wouldn 't happen to have a swordsmith in there , Would you ? I know . It 's really unfair . That was easy enough . You must stop them . Destroy all the guns ! That is how you save japan . Very well . can i speak with you for a moment ? I owe you an apology . What i asked you to do was wrong . I 've been with the company for 30 years . We 've been through a lot of turmoil And made a lot of difficult choices , Some i regret to this day . But right now i 'm dealing with someone Who is a real danger to us , To everyone , And i 'm afraid that in my haste to deal with him , I overstepped my bounds . The file you were holding , adam monroe . Yes . You 're valuable to us , dr . Suresh , Not just for your blood or your knowledge , But to keep us in line . Molly still isn 't well , So i can 't take her away from here . But you 've given me no reason to trust you . I know , i know . We both have a lot at stake . I have someone at my disposal , Someone who can make sure There 's no further misunderstandings . Sound good ? I don 't really have a choice , do i ? Alejandro ! I will get something for your lip . I know you don 't understand me . But i want to tell you why i 'm helping you . It 's that delicious power . You see , when i get my ability back , I 'm gonna kill you ... And your sister . And i 'm gonna take it all . And if i don 't get my ability back , It 's not a total loss . Maya 's learning quickly . She 's a shiny new toy , And she 's all mine . I can 't believe you talked me into that . What ? Somebody could have seen us . Relax . No one saw . And no one will ever believe debbie . Did you see her face ? Classic . Is she gonna be okay ? Definitely . She freaked , but just think of it As a lesson in humility . claire . Oh . Hope i 'm not interrupting . No , it 's okay . How 's debbie ? She blew a .13 . Drinking on school grounds . Got suspended from the cheerleading squad Immediately . Which means we have an opening . First practice is monday after school . You mean it ? I 'm on the team ? Sure .

In all the years i 've known you , Why have you never mentioned a daughter ? This daughter . She died , didn 't she ? Leukemia . I 'm so sorry . That must have been so painful . I can 't even imagine losing claire . To think ... All you have left of her Are your memories . It would be awful if they were taken . Almost as if she never existed . Please don 't . Take the daughter . Don 't leave anything . Wait ! It 's in the warehouse near the train yard . Where we tagged the liquid man . You 'll find your paintings there . Thank you . Now what ? Your haitian friend makes sure That 'll i 'll forget that you were ever here ? I wish it were that easy . Once the company discovers your memory loss , They 're gonna trace it back to the haitian , Which leads to my family . And i can 't have it . What are you doing ? You taught me well , my friend . You said , " make it look as if you were never there . " So now we weren 't . Instead , there was a simple home invasion , A senseless murder . I am offering you a way out . You can stop running ! Shoot me and there is no turning back . You 'll condemn yourself to hell . I know . Kensei , i 've been searching for hours . Come , my friend . We must go back and destroy whitebeard 's guns . If you want to stop him , do it yourself . Something wrong ? I saw you , hiro . After i saved the swordsmith , I came after you , Afraid something had happened to yaeko , Because i love her . And you , friend , betrayed me . No . Yes . You kissed her . It happened ... By accident . You accidentally kissed her ? I accidentally Fell in love with her , And she with me . I 'm so sorry . So you 've been lying to me all along . First you show me that i can be harmed by no weapon , And then you cut me deeper than any blade possibly could . She 's your princess , kensei . I know that .

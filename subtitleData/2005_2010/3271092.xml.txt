Welcome to homicide ! It 's a ride and a half ! Transferred out of here in spring , 2004 . Firearms investigation . This informant tipped me to some guys in greenpoint Selling ak 's out the trunk of their car . I tried to bust ' em . So somebody shot you , killed the two arms dealers , took the guns and money . Wasn 't exactly my shining moment . How much money ? 10 , 20 grand , not much . Informant 's name was ... Nazir . Nazir ? First , last ? Only . Been up north , doin ' three and change for shakedowns in Brighton Beach . Paroled a couple weeks ago . That 's why you 're all hot and bothered with this now . That , and my doctors say I 'm dyin ' . Brighton beach . Russian mafia ? Nazir 's more of a freelance weasel . He 's not even Russian . Czechen or something . Why are you so focused on Nazir ? I think he was the shooter . Well , why would he take you out ? Why not just rip off the dealers ? He didn 't expect me to be there . I got there early . I didn 't trust his information 100 % . I thought you didn 't see the shooter . It had to be him . He was the only one who knew . Was I unclear about my instructions , detective ? No . Then what 's all this ? Andy 's case file . Yeah , I know what it is . Why are you working it after I told you not to ? My fault , sarge . I backed him into a corner . Traded shamelessly on our friendship . I didn 't think he had any friends . Well , I do . Him . I 'll give you to the end of the week . If you don 't have anything by then ... Thanks , sarge . End of the week . Not much time . It 's generous . I may not last even that long . I 'm gonna go rest . Hey , call me when you find Nazir . You got it . You really are friends . You sound surprised . Gives me hope . Andy and I. Got along great . From day one . Ok , where did the blood spatter come from ? It 's not an exit wound . There isn 't one . Wanna bet ? Shut up and find the slug . That blood didn 't have feet on it . It didn 't walk out of his body and climb up the wall . Actually , it did . It expirated . The word is " aspirated , " hotshot . That 's when you breathe it in . Expirated . Blew out of his mouth and nose . That 's not how we do it . Find the slug . Come on , search . Take a look for yourself . You got lucky . You still got a lot to learn . Yeah , Nazir 's one of mine . But I 'm carrying 160 cases . It 's always the case load . I got a handful of parolees I 'm trying to track down , and this guy 's one of them . You want us to congratulate you for only losing a few of your cases ? When was the last time you saw him ? Right after he got out . His intake interview ? And then you lost him ? So it 's been what , two weeks ? About . You don 't know for sure ? I could violate him . Get a warrant . Has he violated his parole ? Not technically . Don 't violate him . Find him . Do your job . Find Nazir . So you were Andy 's partner at the time . I was . We looked into it every which way . Never found the shooter . Good looking dog . Bayou retriever . You have no idea who . A stick-up . Turf war . Rival gun runners . We went down all the roads . - Andy 's dying . - I know . I 'm sorry to hear that . I wish I could give him an answer , But there isn 't one . Andy thinks this snitch has- - Nazir , Nazir , Nazir . It 's a broken record . Now he 's got you playing the tune . Like I didn 't check him out in the first place . I spent hours on Nazir . Hours . Nothin ' . You know Andy . A dog with a bone . Right , pup ? Where do you think you 're going ? Thought I 'd go look for the guy the witnesses said killed him . By yourself ? I don 't think so , lone ranger . Catchin ' bad guys , Andy . That 's the job . I know what the job is . It 's not flyin ' solo , being reckless , Goin ' off half-cocked , tryin ' to be a hero . There 's a reason they give you a partner . You ok ? I 'm fine . This is where it went down . Ok . Walk us through it , so we can take you home . I 'm not dead yet . I didn 't say you were . I was busting these two bandidos When somebody ambushed us . NYPD . Hands in the air . You tried to apprehend them by yourself ? My partner was in court , Processing a perp through the system that night . You couldn 't wait for backup ? Tip was hot . Catchin ' bad guys , that 's the job . Right , John ? This guy goes off the reservation , They give him a medal . Not only that . I get to ride shotgun , too . Andrew . Where have you been ? Greenpoint . Look , Andy , go inside lay down . Ok ? I 'll be up in a minute . Thanks . I get carsick in the back . He wanted to show us what happened . He got shot . He 's dying . That 's what happened . Didi . He asked me to find out why . I couldn 't say no . I only have a few days left with him . That 's all I care about now . Why does all the rest of this matter so much ? Are you still working ? Not getting any traction . Three in the morning . I just finished closing out . Can 't stop . Time 's running out . Andy ? He 's dying . Right in front of my eyes . I 'm sorry to hear that . You were a mess , that first year on the force . So angry . About what had happened to your city . Knockin ' down doors , takin ' names . Andy pulled you through . He was always worried I 'd get myself killed . Little did he know , huh ? It 's ironic . He 's dying and I 'm finally starting to feel ... Mortal ? Something 's definitely going on with Sara . Well , if she really is the one ... Time ... Feels more ... Important ? Lighter . Not so endless . Like there might be less of it for me . Been thinking about death a lot . And for the first time ... it scares me . Welcome to the human condition . Like the man said . Everybody wants to go to heaven , but nobody wants to die . I told you , my cousin Mikhail , I don 't know what happened to him that night . That 's ok . I love shooting . He 's so good at this . The monkey . He 's callin ' my name . I told other police . I don 't know what Mikhail was doing when he got killed . You didn 't know he was selling guns ? I didn 't know he was selling guns . This is like Noah 's ark . Almost like there 's a trick to it . I know how all the flats are gaffed . You are carny , not cop . I 've been both . Sometimes I can 't tell the difference . Promise , you don 't come back ? You cannot say who told you . Mikhail and Sasha , they worked for Viktor Brodsky . Viktor Brodsky . Thank you . Why would a player like Viktor Brodsky be involved In a nickel and dime arms deal ? Well , maybe it wasn 't nickel and dime . It 's gonna be hard to get to . You 're right . Maybe we should just give up . It 's a great idea . We 're looking for your boss . Not here . They had dog racing around here . Right down the block . Back in 1879 . No dog racing here . We are closed . You know these guys ? Sasha Zhukov . Mikhail Casparian . 1911 , they switched . From dogs to cars . Now , cars , they 're a lot harder to root for . 3 years ago , not the best day of their lives . Never seen them . You haven 't even looked . Can I use your phone ? My cell 's on the fritz . We are closed . Phone out of order . I do not give permission . If you see Viktor Brodsky , ask him to call me . All right ? That 's Russian for " will do . " What was that about ? What 'd you get ? Phone number . Viktor Brodsky has a little brother . Ivan . They 're very close . Big mistake , big mistake . Hey , easy , Ivan . Big mistake . I want phone call . A neighborhood bookie ? What 's next ? Mah jong . Bingo . Don 't you have cases to work ? He 's got a point . This is a homicide unit . Good news . We 're working a homicide . I am memorizing faces . Don 't threaten me , Boris . I want a phone call . Call my brother . Absolutely . Let 's find you a phone . Sasha Zhukov . Mikhail Casparian . I don 't know them . They worked for your brother . Who told you that ? A reliable source . Is mistaken . I don 't know them . You wanna look again ? They were robbed and killed working for your brother . I know nothing about these men . What 's going on ? This guy makes book out in Brighton Beach , Detective Marquez is asking him- - Stop . What is going on with you ? This Gleason thing , it 's getting to you . Just working a case , sarge . You are wound so tight you 're gonna pop a gasket . Short on sleep . Amsterdam . You got a visitor . He don 't look happy . Mr. Brodsky . You want to see me , you steal my brother . Ivan 's running an illegal gambling establishment . Victimless crime . You family man ? You 've got no idea . I think you have many , many people you love . Are you threatening me , Mr. Brodsky ? No . Just drawing contrast between us . Me , I just have my brother . I want him back . What 's your interest ? The detective that tried to arrest them Is a friend of mine . He got shot , too . I want to know who shot him . Whoever killed Mike and Sasha . Obviously . They worked for you . At one time . Not that night . I don 't know who they were working for that night . Not for me . I want my brother back now . I don 't know how we missed that . Two gun dealers named Sasha and Mikhail , connected to the biggest russian mobster in Brighton Beach ? Oops . We ran the names by organized crime . They didn 't make the connection either . As far as we know , they were freelancers . They were working for Brodsky . And skimming behind his back ? Kills them without blinking . Brodsky ? I don 't care about Brodsky . Nazir worked for Brodsky once in a while . Everyone out there works for Brodsky . Maybe Nazir tipped Brodsky . Nazir shot me . Nazir . Not Brodsky . Nazir . We 'll find him , Andy . Better find him soon . You guys ok ? Fine . John 's just not used to using real china . I 'm a little clumsy . Nothing broken . Just , um , let me know if I can get you anything . Sure , thanks . I hope you brought your appetite . I made two of these . Might not be enough . He 's legendary . Eats like there 's no tomorrow . This is what you need , hotshot . A woman like this . Except there aren 't any more . Broke the mold . Ahh . Viktor Brodsky says stay out of Brooklyn . John ? John . Are you ok ? Yeah , I 'm all right . You know , if you 're not better by the morning ... Oh , I heal fast . I have amazing powers of recuperation . Yes , I know . So who were they ? Is this some case you 're working on ? Some muggers . You hadn 't saved me , they 'd have taken my wallet , my car keys . Saved you . Hmm . I like the sound of that . Sorry . Hold still . I 've been beat up before . Yes , I 've seen the scars . This was scarier . Maybe because you were here . Sweet . Ah . Baby . I just want you to take care of yourself . No unnecessary risks . You promise ? I promise . Your people beat me up last night . Is this smart , detective ? Mikhail and Sasha were going into business ... for themselves . You had them killed and my friend shot . They were going behind my back . A little here , a little there . Dipping into till , you call it . How much that night ? One million , or so . Not much . Still . Sets a bad example . I didn 't kill them . I would have . Someone else got there first . How did you know what they were doing that night ? Confidential informant . Nazir ? Nazir sells Sasha and Mikhail to me , to your detective friend , and maybe to someone else . The shooter . Three times , same information . Only in America . My friend thinks Nazir was the shooter . Not Nazir I know . You let me go now . I promise I won 't kill you here . Bad for business . You are dead man . How does it feel ? Ah ! Where did you come from ? What the hell are you doing ? You could have got killed . I coulda been killed . Thank you . I didn 't do it for you . I did it for me . I lost too many friends when those towers came ... down last year . Went to too many damn funerals . Damned if I 'm going to yours . Officer request backup . You could 've got yourself killed . Maybe I could have . I thought we were partners . We are . Brodsky told us there was real money involved that night . Those guys were selling junk outta the trunk of their car . Handguns , AK47s . I was there . You sure ? I saw it . 10 , 20 grand , max . The hell with Brodsky . Find Nazir . Ok , Andy . We 'd better be going . Don 't wanna tire you out . Thanks for coming . Say good-bye to Didi for us . Will do . Please don 't get up . I can see you to the door , for Pete 's sake . Everybody think I got both feet in the grave , Instead of just one . They 're keeping him overnight . Can I give you a ride home ? No , thanks . They 're gonna let me sleep in the room . Bless him . It 's what he did for me when I was sick . You were sick ? A few years ago . I had cancer , John . Stage 4 lymphoma . They gave me six months to live . What happened ? If you had six months to live . I went into remission . It was a miracle . When was this ? The remission ? Yeah . Oh , a couple months after Andy got shot . Now he 's the sick one . And I 'm fine . Except I 'm not fine without him . I know . Sometimes I think he loves me so much That he figured out how ... to take my cancer away and give it to himself . I 'd do that for him if I could . Was this before he went to firearms investigation ? Well , it had to be , because you two were partners at the time . He never said a word . I asked him not to . Andy was more upset than I was , I think . He spent hours researching , Drugs , treatments , anything that would give us more time . Did he find anything ? Found a doctor in Brazil , but our insurance company wouldn 't cover it . How 's Gleason ? Can 't do anything else for him . How long now ? A few days , at the outside . I 'm sorry . Yeah . I know you promised him . I 'm gonna go through the case file , See if there 's anything else I can find . Thanks . Amsterdam . One of my snitches spotted Nazir near the mermaid museum . Ever been on it ? The cyclone ? I 'm not so good with heights . Amusement park 's been sold . Gonna build condos . That 's New York . Sentimental bastard , aren 't you ? Cyclone 's landmarked . It 's not going anywhere . There he is . Nazir ! Stop ! Stop , damn it ! Damn , damn , damn ! This way . Ain 't done nothin ' . Why you chasing me ? Why you running ? ' cause you 're chasing me . You maggot . I 'm gonna violate you back to prison so fast . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! What have I done ? Calm down , calm down . You have no right to lay your hands on me . Bruises or no bruises . Your choice . You call that a choice ? It is not proper for a woman to be alone with man who is not blood relative or husband . Don 't think of me as a woman . That would be hard . I can smell your perfume . Don 't think about that . Think of me as a police officer . Think of me as the person who 's sending you back to prison . It would be safer for me in prison . Who are you afraid of ? Brodsky ? He said there was a lot of money in play that night . This was no nickel and dime street corner deal . A million dollars . I don 't know nothing . Please . Tell us what you know . - We 'll protect you . - You can 't protect me . Andy Gleason thinks you were the shooter . I have alibi for that night . Alibi . Brodsky said you tipped off someone else . No . I want lawyer . You don 't get a lawyer . You 're a convicted felon in possible violation of his parole . I 'm not . You can 't hold me . He 's terrified . When you mentioned the money , he almost had a stroke . He 's scared of Brodsky . He 's scared of someone . I 'm gonna check out Nazir 's alibi for the ... night of the shooting . Ok , you 're scared of heights . I 'm fine . Job like this , you gotta find a place to cool out , Get some perspective . Nothin ' to be ashamed of . I 'm not scared . Too bad . If you were , this would be extra good . Remind you you 're actually not bulletproof . Up here , everything fades away . Time , other people , the world . Just the size of everything . This job , we get haunted . We see the worst things , we get taken over . Forget about a whole career . I 've seen it happen to guys in a second . Last September ... Even if you are actually bulletproof , you need a partner . That 's my point . I know you , Andy . You never would 've gone in without your partner . Didi got sick . You needed money . You transferred outta homicide to FIU . Guns , cash . A chance for a big score . You went there to rip those guys off , not bust them . She was dying , John . You would have done the same thing , You had somebody you cared about that much . Maybe I do . Then you must understand what I did . You gonna arrest me ? For what ? Trying to rip off some Russian gun runners ? Is it gonna come out ? Well , if we catch the shooter , it will . I 'll lose my pension . Didi will have nothing . Maybe you shouldn 't have stirred this pot . I 'm dyin ' . Want a little justice . Catch the guy who shot me . Come on , Andy . You wanted the money . Nazir got popped right after the heist . You went to prison . You thought maybe you could get it back . Leave it for didi . Andy . That money must be long gone by now . A man can dream . Amsterdam . It 's Nazir . ? ? Close range . Through and through . CSU 's on the way . I remember when there was no CSU . Of course you do . You looking for the slug ? Good luck . Let 's see if it matches the one in Andy 's chest . Is it a match ? Looking through the case file , i found something . Something that should have been there but wasn 't . Nazir 's alibi . You 're sure ? It isn 't there . Williams said he spent hours with him . So , it got me thinking . About who was where that night . Thanks for meeting us out here . No problem . You said you had a break in the case ? You heard Nazir got popped ? We found the slug . Now all you need is the gun to match it with . Longshot , right ? Needle , haystack . For some reason I 'm feeling optimistic about that . Andy . Detective . Marquez . Jeez , Andy , you look rough . You look fat and sassy . Can 't complain . Ok . You lured me out here . Off my death bed . So where 's Nazir ? Nazir 's dead . Dead ? How ? Somebody shot him . What am I doing here ? Where 's the guy who shot me ? You 're looking at him . Him . What ? What kind of crap is this ? You were the shooter , Joe . The stick up guy . You took everybody down . NYPD . Hands in the air . You were my partner . That 's right . I was . Well , come on , Andy . You know me . You ripped me off . They 're lying . You weren 't in court that night . You removed Nazir 's alibi from the case file . Pretty thin . Thick enough for a search warrant . We find your gun , we 'll have ballistics , too . The slug in Andy 's chest , Nazir , the two shooters . Where 's my money ? Easy , Andy . It was for my wife . She was dying . Where 's my money , Joe ? It 's gone . I spent it . I 'm sorry , Andy . I didn 't want to shoot you . I was just trying to make a score . I didn 't know you 'd get there first . You really want to kill him ? Go ahead , Andy . Now 's your chance . You 're never gonna answer for it . Not in this world . That 's right . Didi will . He 's a piece of trash . He betrayed me . He 's still your partner . Cleaned in the last 24 hours . Thanks . You 're not the only detective around here ... with mad skills . I know . Look familiar ? Found it at your house . It 's on its way to ballistics . Let 's go . My worst nightmare . A cop , in prison ? The gift that keeps on giving . So , Andy ? Take you home ? I 'll never see this again . One more favor . Gotta ask you something . Didi . Whatever she needs . You know I 'll take care of it . I know . Had to say it . Make sure . Still scared of heights . A little bit . Me , too . I always was . That 's why this is my place . The fear . Keeps you in the moment . In the moment . Focused . You 're right . Up here , everything fades away . Turn back the hands of time . Aren 't you curious ? What I just dropped in the mail ? I figured you 'd tell me if I needed to know . Divorce papers . Seriously ? Signed , sealed , and delivered . You 're a free woman . Very . That calls for a celebration . How 's it feel ? Honestly ? Sad . Scary . Exciting . Regrets ? A few . But I did it my way . Andy and Didi , they were married for 23 years . At the wake , she told me how they met . Look out ! Somebody help ! You take a picture every year ? For the last 160 years or so . Ever since they invented cameras . Of course they didn 't call it times square until 1904 . Thank you for showing me this . I wanted you to understand . I do . Finally . Now I can go . I wish you didn 't have to . Sara . This is a good thing . You made me mortal . Only to lose you . We should have had more time . We will . When ? In the sweet bye and bye . Promise ? Promise . * a drop in the ocean * * a second to end all time * * one stop in the yellow sky * * but you mean * * the whole world to me * * you 're a light * * so let this be * * bless this time * * stay one more day * * please , bless this day * * stay one more day * I thought I lost you . * stay one more , stay one more * * stay one more day * * just one more , just one more * * just one more day *

 Ladies and gentlemen , we will soon been starting our in-flight movie . We will be coming through with Hazas which are available for purchase for 4 dollars . And of course exact change 's always appreciated . You should put keys on your back . Excuse me ? It 's an old wife 's tale to stop the bloody nose . Yeah ? Actually , I tried it once . It doesn 't work . It 's all bull . Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me , I need to talk to you . Yes , sir , I 'll be with you in one moment . No , now ! Please . I 'll be right back . - What 's the problem ? - I 'm in trouble . There 's something happening to me , that I don 't have the time or permission - to explain to you . - What is it ? You need to listen to me very carefully . I need you to go to the passengers , I need you to collect as many sedatives or tranquilizers as you can . Okay , sir , I need you to take a deep breath . This isn 't a panic attack . This is real . We will die , all of us , if you don 't do what I say . Sir , a threat like that is in violation of FAA ... Do I look to you like I care about that ? Oh , my God . I need you to get those drugs for me . Do you have any weapons , a gun ? Go call the captain . Sir , I 'm going to need you to calm down . You 're going to scare the passengers . They should be scared . What weapons do you have ? Yeah , it 's Melissa . What weapons ? ! We have a man here , who 's claiming to be in ... We have a Taser in the cockpit , which I will use on you if you don 't calm down . Taser won 't do a thing . It 'll just piss me off . He wants drugs , but he seems to be on something already . I need you to do what I say . I 'm going into that bathroom . You keep me in there . You keep that door closed . Get whatever sedatives you can as soon as you can . You can go in that bathroom , sir . I am not messing around ! When you get the drugs , you come back , you knock . If I don 't answer , or if I do , and what you see isn 't me anymore , you keep that door closed . You hear me ? You keep me in there , away from the other passengers . Get the drugs . Quick . Yes , sir . I 'll do that . Yes , sir , but I think 40 minutes is too long . Ladies and gentlemen , we have a passenger who is having a hard time ... Please remain calm . Everything 's going to be just fine . Ah ! Uh ! Ah ! Agh ! Ah ! What 's he doing in there ? I don 't know . It just got quiet . Maybe he passed out . The captain says we should restrain him . I 've only ... Seatbelts . Seatbelts . Well , hello . Look , aunt Liv , I 'm beautiful . You are beautiful . Yes , you 're beautiful . But why don 't we put this down and take these off ? Here , give me ... what else do you have here ? I 'll take that . All right . Go wash that off . Okay . Sorry . Oh , please . That 's fine . Do you remember when we had that sleepover at aunt Missy 's ? And then you found the perfume and poured it all over ... Was it Lola ? - No , Lola was the hamster . Roxy was the dog . - Right . Liv , what is this ? Is this mom 's ? " always ? " This isn 't mom 's . No . It 's from John . John ... Your partner , John ? Yeah . You told me that you guys were ... He asked you to marry him ? Uh , no . He didn 't . It was a mistake . Suffice to say that it never actually happened . Uh , no . You can 't do that . - Well , I have to . - I am your sister . And I have told you ... Every excruciating detail of my failed marriage . - There 's nothing that you can ... - He was a traitor . The people that he was working with , They still don 't even know who they were . But whoever they were , he was bad . And whatever was between us was a lie , So that he could gain my trust , So that I didn 't see him for what he was . God , Liv ... I 'm so sorry . Yeah . Me too . And I thought Greg was a jerk . Uh , Greg is a jerk . Yeah . Greg is a jerk . Hello ? Where ? Flight 718 went down a little after 6 : 00 pm . Witnesses say the plane just fell out of the sky . Once we recover the black box , we 'll know more . So why are we here ? Shouldn 't NTSB be taking point ? According to Air Traffic Control , They got a distress call from the pilot , But it was cut off and they lost communication . Whatever happened up there , I 'm guessing has something to do with what I 'm about to show you . It 's burned badly . Forensics thought it was an animal at first . They were mistaken . No one 's ever seen an animal like this . I can understand the confusion . This creature has ... Pelage characteristic of an animal . And yet ... Mm . I will say this ... Our friend here didn 't start out this way . Hey , Liv . Hey . Copies of the manifest passports . 147 passengers . It 's going to be a long few days ... For the poor folks tasked with trying ... To identify the remains . So is there anyone of any interest ? Not at first glance , no . Does the elder bishop have any ideas about that ? Not yet . Or if he does , he isn 't saying . So the official word right now is engine failure . The pilot tried to bring it in for an emergency landing . The way this thing works ... - Works ... - What it does to you ? It 's a horror show . It 's far worse than you can even imagine . I 'm telling you , this stuff ... It 's a horror show , John . What ? You find something ? Yeah , I think this is our guy . - The fried dog man ? - Yeah . Marshall Bowman . We need to pull everything we can find on him . How can you know that ? Call it my gut . You 're good . I would expect whatever caused this mutation ... Would 've completely alter his internal organs . Though the kidneys appear normal . It also gave him four extra nipples . Maybe he mutated into a opossum . No , opossum 's have 15 mammaries . Unlike most mammals , who have an even number of nipples . Hence , the one half rule regarding nipples . The one half nipple rule ? You just had to ask , didn 't you ? The typical number of young in a litter is usually equal ... to half the number of nipples on the animal . The number of nipples being the maximum litter size . Humans , for example , One child is the typical . Maximum , twins . Barring extraordinary cases . In which case , numerous nipples would be warranted . God , I hope I never have to hear him say the word " nipple " again . Evidence of an extradural hematoma . Possibly epistaxis . Meaning , he had a colossal nosebleed . I know . Hm . There 's something hard inside here . Scalpel . Forcep . What is it ? A tumour ? Not unless a tumour is made of glass . I need someone Overat Vertusair , right now . Yes , this is about 718 . What do you think ? Look through all the internal reports on structural breakdown ... Here 's everything we have on Marshall Bowman 42-years-old , worked at a credit courtier in Marseilles . Managed their corporate accounts . Has doctor Bishop been able to make a positive ID yet ? No , but we should contact the bank , - and see what they can tell us about him . - Done . Last page has Bowman 's clients from the U.S. He outdid himself this time . And he 's gonna get impatient to sell it off . So you have to get the money lined up fast . What ? Olivia , you okay ? People , we got something . Simmons , patch me in through public address . Wilson sent over the black box recording , the last 60 seconds of the flight . Play it . New York center , this is Vertusair 718 heavy . We have a report that there ... Tower to Vertusair 718 , other aircraft calling , say again ? Our purser 's reporting a disturbance in the main cabin . There seems ... It 's trying to get in . New York , we need an emergency land ... 718 ... we have something on board ... It 's already killed at least three ... Dear god , hold that back ! That 's it ... Tech is trying to recover more . Let 's back to work , people . Charlie . - Hm ? - Come here a second . See this guy ? Daniel Hicks , he owns an import export company Based in Chelsea . He 's the guy that Marshall Bowman was flying in to meet . So we need to bring him in for questioning . This your gut again ? What 's going on , Liv ? Okay , this is going to sound insane . So let 's just put it in the category of " crazy things happening in Walter Bishop 's lab . " Okay . John Scott and I shared consciousness . Our minds were connected through a procedure before he died , and ... Some of his memories are still in my head . His memories ? And sometimes I get flashes . I see what he saw in the memory . And in one of these flashes , I saw him with Marshall Bowman and this guy ... Hicks . I think they were all working together . On what ? I don 't know . A weapons sale of some kind ? Okay . I 'll bring him in . That 's it ? Despite the thousand questions I have in my head right now , I 'm going to bite my tongue . Thank you . Bishop 's house of horrors . Hey , how we doing ? Good , we got the bloodwork back . You were right , it is Marshall Bowman . Anything else ? Yeah , Walter seems to think he was dosed with some kind of designer virus . So , it was intentional . Hard to say it was an accident , this stuff doesn 't exist in nature . And whoever did it , would have to have a deep understanding of cutting-edge genetics . I mean , it completely rewrote Bowman 's DNA . Even if the plane hadn 't of crashed , he wouldn 't have survived the transformation . And ... There 's something else . And this falls under the heading of " what the hell ? " But we found something in his left hand . Here , I 'll stream it to you . It 's a glass disk , about the size of a nickel . I don 't believe it . We found a similar disk on the D.E.A. agent a few months back . I thought you told me that Bowman was a banker . Now you 're telling me he 's some kind of agent ? Uh , I don 't know . But Charlie is bringing in a guy who might be able to give us some answers . Tell us about your business , Mr. Hicks . My business ... It 's import and export . But you know that already . You just came from my office . Why don 't you indulge us , Mr. Hicks ? What do you import and export ? Furniture , mostly . Mostly French . 18th and 19th century . Look , I 'd like to know what this is all about . I run a clean business . How do you know Marshall Bowman ? He 's my banker , overseas . Why , has he gotten into some kind of trouble ? This is wonderful . Don 't you agree ? It 's just like a good detective movie . Mr. Hicks , have you heard what happened on flight 718 ? Yeah , that 's the plane that crashed , right ? Mm-hmm . This might be hard to recognize , but ... This is Marshall Bowman . He was on board that plane . I ... I don 't understand . I believe you do , Mr. Hicks . I believe you know how that happened . I believe that you and Marshall Bowman conspired to distribute a deadly virus , And this is the unintended result . Look ... I think you have mistaken for someone else . Your nose is bleeding . Can we have a box of tissues , please ? No . No , tissue won 't help . Find me some sedatives . Now ! I need help . Ah ! Walter , what 's happening ? I expect the same thing that happened To that man in the airplane . Here . I may be able to suspend the process . No ! Not yet . Not until he talks . Please ! You want help ? I want answers . We ... must ... Have ... been ... dosed . I want to know the name . Who dosed you ? Conrad . Ah ! Oh , I don 't think that 's working . I checked the DHS database , Nothing came up on a " Conrad , " first or last name , When cross-referenced with a Daniel Hicks . Well , so far , there 's no mention of a " Conrad " In John 's old files , either . Hm . Why don 't you let me take a turn ? Thank you . Anything ? Yes . As often is the case , has good news and bad news . He is transforming , But I placed him in a medically-induced coma , - to slow the process . - Which is that ? The good , or the bad ? - Huh ? - Which is it ? The good news , or the bad news ? That 's the bad news . The good news , is that I 've already synthesized A preliminary sample of an antidote . I 'm testing it on tissue samples as we speak . And ... a watermelon . As a control group . And will it be ready in time ? That depends on your definition of time . If you mean before he turns into a beast , I wouldn 't wager on it , no . Wonderful . Cut open his hand . What ? I want to see if there 's a disk in it . Like Bowman 's . I like cutting . Where did you get these ? One of them was in Bowman 's palm . The other one was on Hicks . We 've seen one of these before . Did the N.S.A ever determine what it was for ? A data storage device . Apparently used to transport information . I want authorization to exhume John Scott 's body . John Scott ? I think he may have one of these on him , too . I think he was working with Bowman and Hicks . I 'm afraid that won 't be possible . Well , then make it possible . - Excuse me ? - I know it 's against protocol , but right now , - frankly , I don 't give a damn . - Stop . And if you don 't want to ask Harris , then ... - I said stop . - I 'll go and ask him , myself . I can 't deliver John Scott 's body . And that other disk ? It didn 't go to the N.S.A. Where did it go ? One of the advantages Of being the defence department 's biggest contractor Is the massive dynamic has money to develop technologies Generations beyond that of the US government . So when we were unable to retrieve the information Off the disks , I requested Nina 's help But I suspect that you telling me this Isn 't the only reason that we 're here . Agent Dunham . Miss Sharp . For what it 's worth , it was not my decision To keep this from you . As you suspected , We discovered a glass disk identical to the others , Embedded in agent Scott 's hand . While he may appear to be alive , I assure you he is not . We 've kept him in a suspended state of ... We believe that the information stored in the disks Self-destructs when the disk 's host dies . We attempted to utilize agent Scott 's body ... His blood , his DNA ... to try to retrieve the data . The small amount of information we were able to gather Seems to implicate agent Scott As part of a bio-terror cell . There were also references to a Conrad . We believe he 's a scientist . Designing chemical and biological weapons for sale On the black market . CIA has received scattered intel on him in the past Nothing concrete . We don 't even know his full name . So a plane full of people are dead . And our best lead is ... nothing ? A chemist , who 's name we don 't even know ? It gets worse . Three hours ago , French Intelligence related to D.C. That an informant of theirs claims a major weapons sale Is about to go down in Chicago . However , what the informant was unable to say Is exactly where , or when , the sale is going to take place . What the informant did know is that the man behind the sale Is known as Conrad . Hello ? I 'm on my way back . Is Walter there ? Yeah , why ? I just got word that Conrad 's planning on selling this virus . - What ? When ? - I don 't know . But if I 'm right , and John was working with these guys , Then he has the answer in his memory . Which means that it 's in mine . Olivia ... You know how dangerous this is ... Tell Walter to prep the tank . I 'm going back in . - You are ok ? - Yeah Be careful . We 're online . All right . Olivia , Can you hear me ? Yes . You must listen to my voice at all times . It is your connection , your lifeline . - Understood ? - Understood . I am going to try and guide you Through John Scott 's memory In an attempt to take you back To the place where he met our comatose friend , here . Now , picture yourself At the top of a steep flight of stairs . As you descend , step by step , You 'll become progressively more , and more relaxed . Now , here come the last five steps . Four ... Three ... Two ... One . Where are you ? I 'm in a bedroom . No , it 's not a bedroom . This is where we used to meet . John and I. Oh , man . This is crazy . - Absolutely , this will never happen again . - No . Ask her what she sees . What do you see ? Me and John . Don 't worry , he can 't see you . Remember , you 're observing a memory . I 'll be right back . Hi , Liv . Olivia , what 's happening ? John 's talking to me . That 's not possible , Olivia . He can 't see you . We 'll try to take you elsewhere . Where John and his accomplices met . - Don 't move . - Liv , what 's wrong ? Stop . Don 't . Don 't move . Olivia , focus on the sound of my voice . I said stay there . I miss you . Don 't move . I 'm going to ask you a question , and you 're going to give me the answer . You were working with a man named Conrad . He developed a biological weapon . I want to know who he is , and who he 's planning on selling it to . Liv , put the gun ... Stop lying to me , John . I know that you 're part of a terrorist cell . We have your partner in custody . Hicks . He 's dying . And Bowman is already dead . They were infected with some kind of a virus . - Liv ... - No ! What just happened ? I don 't know . We need to get her out , now . We can 't . It 's too dangerous . She 's in deep rem . We need to reconnect before we pull her out . Olivia , can you hear me ? Olivia ? Olivia , can you hear ... Olivia ? Walter ? Olivia . I want answers , John . There he is . Who ? Conrad . He 's a monster , Liv . Capable of creating horrible things . Weapons , which he does for no other reason than because he can . 'Cause he 's curious . Then he sells them to the highest bidder . That 's him . And that 's me . Problem was , we were hunting a man none of us had ever seen before . If I 'd have known I had him in my sights , I could 've taken him out right then and there . It was my most important mission . And I failed . I let that monster get away . I didn 't know it was him . What mission ? Who were you working for ? Bowman and Hicks ... The truth is , they were and they are ... government agents . NSA , secret task force . And so was I. I don 't believe you . It 's the truth , Liv . No , not again . If you want me to believe you , then you need to prove it to me . I can 't , Liv . It was Black Ops , a deniable operation . If we were to take out Conrad , there could be no record of our involvement . That 's why I could never tell you . Even though I wanted to . If that 's the truth , then help me . Tell me where the sale is going down . What sale ? The virus . We believe that Conrad 's planning on selling it . I don 't know what 's going on inside Conrad 's organization anymore . But Hicks would know . You need to talk to Hicks . He was privy to all that information . - He has it right in his hand . - John ? John ? Liv , trust Hicks . He can help you . John ? John . John ? - We have to pull her out . - John ! Prepare 30 CC 's of dextroamphetamine . - Oh , Peter . - You 're okay . You 're going to be fine . I understand . Thanks for checking . My contact at NSA . Couldn 't confirm a single thing that John said . Of course , John said they wouldn 't be able to . Well , that 's the perfect alibi . One that you can 't confirm . Uh , yeah . How 's it coming ? His cell sample 's membranes still aren 't absorbing the inhibitor . We don 't know if the antidote 's working yet . But it might . We could try it and see . You want to wake up Hicks ? Even though he could transform just like Bowman did ? Well , Conrad could be selling this virus as we speak . And Hicks is the only one who can tell us how this is going to go down . And you 're willing to take John 's word that you can trust Hicks ? It finally happened . I 'm now referring to a dead guy , - who only exists in your mind . - Boy ! I need another bag of midazolam right away . What if he 's still lying to you ? Have you considered that ? If Hicks and John are working with Conrad , that maybe John is using you to tip Conrad off ? Maybe he wants to get you killed . This is a bad idea , Olivia . My mother always says I stick my nose in places it does not belong . I know we haven 't known each other that long . But you are one of the best judges of character I 've ever met . So , I guess the question is what 's your instinct ? When you were with John , when you were looking in his eyes , was he for real ? Prep Hicks . Ready or not , we 're administering the antidote . An experiment ... How exhilarating . This is Agent Dunham . I need to talk to Broyles . Sorry to wake you . Little worse than adrenaline . Except , perhaps , lice , which is a nightmare . Mr. Hicks , try and breathe normally . Can you hear me ? This is an antidote . While I can 't guarantee that it 'll actually work , I do have a recorded I.Q. Of ... 196 . Really ? We know about the work you were doing with John Scott . Now we need your help . For those of you not in the know , information has come to this agency about a weapons buy . The goods ? The same virus responsible for Flight 718 . I know this label gets slapped on pretty much all we do , but preventing this transaction from taking place is our highest priority . The prospective buyer of this weapon landed in the United States this morning . 0700 hours , O 'Hare airport . And we were there . That suspect is now in custody . And no surprise to anyone , refuses to cooperate . But we do have someone else in custody . An informant with extensive information on the players we will be dealing with his name is Daniel Hicks . And he has agreed to relay all necessary information to Agent Dunham using an encrypted and untraceable two-way radio , which we implanted earlier this afternoon . Agent Francis will coordinate surveillance . The informant disclosed that the meet is scheduled for 1600 hours , at the Fairchild Hotel . Room 1021 . The seller , a man known as Conrad will not be there . But his intermediaries will . We have agents standing by to move in corresponding rooms . Per regulations , no raid will be ordered until Agent Dunham has visual on the weapon . When she does , she 'll give the go signal . That signal will be ... Christmas . Now we all look forward to seeing how she works that into conversation . Okay , people , let 's get it done . Listen up . Spotted the seller . The seller is making a phone call . Stand by . You didn 't have to come with me , you know . Shady deals with shady guys in shady hotels is my M.O. And typically , if someone is going to kill you , it 's a good idea to have an ally in the room . I 'm not scared . Being fearless doesn 't mean you 're being safe . - Astrid , how 're we doing ? - Hey . Hicks is on board and ready to go . I 'm putting you on speaker . So far so good , Olivia . 140 over 90 , not bad Considering 3 cc 's of adrenaline . Are they going to expect bona fides ? Hicks , tell me what I need to know . Well , they 're going to be suspicious Why they 've never seen you before . You tell them you used to work with Anderson . Anderson , okay . Got it , what else ? You tell them Ernesto flew in for the meeting , But he got called back to the basement , And he couldn 't come . What do you mean , called back to the basement ? " Just say it , he 'll understand . You 're not messing with me , are you , Hicks ? You trusted John Scott , right ? Then trust me . He 's on the move . Seller 's heading inside . That 's him . Here we go . Liv ... You be careful . You 're Gavin . Susan . I used to work with Anderson . I was expecting someone else . Well , Ernesto flew in , But he was called back to the basement , So he couldn 't make it . Mm . Who 's he ? Who are they ? We 'll sweep you and get to business . Good . She 's clean . The money please . Just a formality , I assure you . It will only take a moment . Have we met before ? You look familiar . Did you work with Anderson , too ? He 's testing you . You tell him Peter met Anderson at new college at Oxford . They met at Oxford . New college . Isn 't that right ? What does it matter to you where I met anyone ? Where did you meet ? On campus ? I 'm sorry , I have no idea where they actually met . We met at the White Horse . On wheatly road , you know it ? I don 't recall . You would . Thai food ... it 's fantastic . That 's where I met Anderson . I could tell you what each of us was wearing , If you want to hear it . Where the hell did he come up with that ? I have no idea . It 's all here . Have a seat . I have to admit ... I was sceptical that you 'd come at all . Well , of course we came . I thought it would be Paris all over again . Tell him that was because of The French intelligence report , and he knows it . That was because of the French intelligence report . You know that . True . But this is a larger purchase . Hello ? Okay . Conrad would like to see you . When ? Now . He 's on his way . What 's going on ? Do they have the package ? Why isn 't she calling the raid ? Because Conrad 's coming . So what ? So she doesn 't want to scare him off . She wants to get him . She 's waiting for Conrad . We 've included this with the purchase . It 's a reverse mutator . An antidote . It would take you years to reverse engineer an antivirus . It 's why the purchase price is so high . The formula in itself is deceiving in it 's complexity Well , we shouldn 't have a need for that . It 's only in case of accidental exposure . Which , I assure you , would be fatal . Now why wouldn 't Ernesto call me back himself ? And tell me someone else was coming to meet ? Uh-oh . Oh , god . Get me a tranquilizer quickly . It 's happening to him . Hicks is transforming . Well , how would I know ? I 'm not Ernesto 's mother . At least tell me who he was meeting . Agh . Eh . Ah ! Quickly ! Quickly ! What the hell is going on ? I asked you ... a simple question . Who was Ernesto meeting ? I need a name . Somebody , anybody else in your operation . Oh , no . Oh , god . Hicks is out . I 'll ask you again ... Who was your colleague meeting ? Sir , should we move in ? Okay , whoa , whoa , whoa . Okay , okay . That 's enough . Now , just tell them ! Tell them , I 'm not getting greased over Ernesto 's dirty little secret . What secret is that ? - Shut your mouth ! - Ernesto is sick . He 's ... he 's dying ... sick , okay ? He just doesn 't want anybody to know . Damnit , Liv . Give the signal . - What the hell is wrong with you , he asked you ... - What the hell is wrong with me ? I got a gun in my face , for starters . Enough of you . Shut up ! Get that gun out of my face right now . Gavin ! Who are these people ? According to them , Ernesto 's sick . It 's true . He found out the day before Christmas . I spoke to Ernesto this morning . He 's fine . Kill them both right now . FBI ! Put the gun down ! Hands on the table . Get down . John Scott says hi . Turns out , Conrad 's a French citizen . Conrad Etienne Moreau ... Wanted in connection with at least half a dozen biological attacks . And those are just the ones we know about . He 's been manufacturing biological weapons and distributing them on the black market for years . And you caught him . I would think you could at least let yourself crack a smile about that . Well , I didn 't do it alone . You know ... Despite the successful outcome of this case , John Scott 's status remains the same . As far as this department is concerned , He 's a traitor . Even if he was telling the truth . There 's no way to confirm it . That 's all right . I know the truth . And that 's enough . Hello ? Anyone here ? Agent Dunham ? Where is everyone ? They took that gentleman that was here to the hospital , to recover . So the antidote worked ? He started improving almost as soon as I administered it . Which is more than I can say for my own concoction . Any case , I was just about to read - a bedtime sto ... - Walter ... I was hoping you 'd do me a favour . Even if you did go back in , I 'm dubious you 'd even be able to find him . What do you mean ? Your brain wave patterns are returning to normal . Your mind is finally succeeding Purging itself of agent Scott . Even if you perfectly reconnect , it would be for seconds , minutes at best . And then you would never see him again . Then we need to do this now . It 's beautiful out here , isn 't it ? We caught him today . Conrad . Really ? I 'm sorry that I doubted you . I should 've trusted you . No , it wasn 't your fault . I always meant to tell you . I guess I ran out of time . There was one other thing . I know we can 't ever be together , Not really . Maybe I won 't know the difference . I love you , Liv .

 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ... You 've got a nuclear sub ? Seawolf sub . The Jimmy Carter . We 've got a scrubbed trip eight for a captain . Damn it , cameron , you 're supposed to burn the endos . What 's happening with you ? I 've planted an explosive in my skull , near my chin . It 's a small amount , but it 's enough . I saw the metal , and she knows that i saw it . Master your fear . Remember the mission . I can 't go back there . You are here to keep john connor away from her . I can get her to tell me the truth . Stay away from her . Cameron was supposed to kill me ! You knew that was the only thing that would turn john against her . I rescued you from hell ! And i took you to paradise . You don 't need to be so dramatic about this . It 's a milk run . A milk run across 8,000 miles of metal-infested ocean . Are you gonna be like this every time i ship out ? Listen jesse , i 'm going on a mission , too . Oh , i see . One of those missions . No . It 's something else . It 's different . Different . Derek , how 's it different ? What does different mean ? Different means different . Just listen to me . You 're stuck in a can under the ocean , with one of those things ... don 't worry about queeg , all right ? He 's a good bloke . He 's not a bloke . Jesse , he 's not on our side . Don 't ever think that . Aim for the chip . Aim for the chip , they don 't get up . I love you too . Derek ... hoo-roo . Means " i 'll see you later . " Hoo-roo . What 're you doing ? Moving . Yeah , well ... seems about the right time for that . Get your stuff sorted . I 'm nearly done with the living room , i 'm gonna start on the garage . Uh , hey . Why don 't you let me take the garage ? I just got a lot of memory cards and flash drives out there i need to sort through . I don 't want us to save our dakara records and torch my old copy of space invaders . It 's all yours . Thanks . Great , it looks like a robot serial killer lives here . Oh , i guess one does . I 'm doing inventory . Well , don 't do it here . We need to clear all this stuff out before mom comes in and finds it . Dig a hole out back . Down below the retaining wall . We 'll bury the parts and come back for them later . We have to find a place to burn them . And we will burn them . What you drinking ? I don 't know . You don 't know what you 're drinking ? There 's booze in it . Some sugary crap to cut the hell outta the burning taste , and some ice . 'course , this one 's pretty much empty . Can you get her another one of ... whatever she 's drinking ? If you don 't know what it 's called , how do you order it ? Just like you did . But it 's gotta start somewhere , right ? I mean , you can just sit down and ask for that right off . What happened to your face ? You ask a lot of questions for a guy who wants to get in my pants . Do i ? Yeah , see ... there 's another one . That 's a nice costume . You thinking about a career in the military ? Actually , i fly p-3s . For the navy . Mm . Brown shoe . Guilty as charged . You ? Submarine . Bubblehead . A bubblehead ! They let women on subs in australia ? Yeah . Reprogrammed killer robots too . Yeah , we don 't discriminate . Well , there 's a coincidence . I hunt subs , you drive subs . Sort of like the wolf and the sheep dog . Not that i 'm comparing you to a dog , or anything . That 's a good point , actually . In fact , i just remembered something . What 's that ? Sheep dogs hate wolves . And i hate brown shoes . I can 't believe you guys are just up and moving like this . You could let me throw a party . You know you never did come to dinner . Tape . It 's okay . It 's not like you 're moving to mars , right ? I mean , we can still totally keep in touch . Absolutely . Oh , here , let me help you with that . No , no , no , i 'm good . Sit down . You know , i am fine . People say it takes a while to get back to fighting trim , but i snapped back like a rubber band . Yeah , mostly like a rubber band . You look great . I 'm thinking if i can breastfeed him till he 's five , maybe i can trick my body into letting me keep these boobs . Kidding . Sort of . Who 's got the baby ? Trevor . He 's ... he 's not back , he 's just visiting . He said he needed some daddy-time . I don 't blame him . Not after the call they got last night . They found a girl in the river . Shot through the chest . Trevor had said that it looked like she 'd been executed . That 's terrible . Pretty little blonde thing . Probably moved here from iowa or something to be an actress , and fell in with the wrong people . Dreams die hard . Then trevor said all they have to go on are some scars from an attempted suicide and a tattoo on her wrist . A pretty little star . Right here . Your mother 's coming . All right , quick . Hide this stuff . I need to talk to john . Alone . Goodbye , bird . There 's a 51 % chance i wouldn 't have killed you . Cameron . I know . I heard you . Riley 's dead . Was it you ? Did you kill her ? What if i did ? Don 't play games with me . I need the truth . I didn 't kill her . I want to believe you . Believe me . Sometimes you lie to me . Yes . I do , but i 'm not lying now . I am sorry . You 're sorry ? For what ? For your loss . I really wish i could believe that too . So are you gonna say anything ? Jesse ? Thanks . Thanks . For bailing me out . Thanks . I know you don 't like police stations . Maybe that 's because i 'm a fugitive . I know . So thanks . What happened ? I told you , i got in a fight . With four naval aviators . Really just three . One of them went down pretty quick . What 's going on ? Nothing . I don 't believe you . I need to know what the hell 's going on . I told you . Nothing . We crossed the line yet ? Not yet . Give it a tick . Zero degrees north , heading south-southwest over the equator . Now we 've crossed the line . One nice thing about metal driving the boat , a schedule 's a schedule . One nice thing . That mean we 're done ? Quiet , you . Proclamation . Know ye , that sonarman second class christopher garvin , on the 13th day of september , 2027 , aboard u.s.s. Jimmy carter , appeared at the equator at latitude zero , longitude 180 , entering into our royal domain , and having been inspected and found worthy by my royal staff , and was initiated into the solemn mysteries of the ancient order of the deep . I command my subjects to honor and respect him as one of our trusty shellbacks . Now rise , shellback . Never gets old , does it ? Never . Depth charge ? General quarters , go . Go ! Come and play hide and seek , mommy . I 'm working . But you promised . Patience is a virtue , savannah . To tolerate delay . It implies self-control and forbearance . As opposed to wanting what we want when we want it . Something to think about . Would you like to play hide and seek ? Mr. Ellison ... my daughter , savannah ... she 's missing . She 's in the building , mr . Ellison . We just have to find her . There 's 23 stories . Yes . And there 's someone who knows what 's going on in all of them . John henry , we 're looking for my daughter , savannah . Have you seen her today ? Yes , i have . She wanted to play a game . Where is she now ? She 's hiding . Tell us where she 's hiding . That 's not how the game works . How 's the game work ? Hide and seek , there are many variations . The one we 're playing , you guess what i 'm thinking , i give you a clue . Listen to me , john henry . You 're gonna tell me where savannah is , and you 're gonna tell me now . I 'm thinking of a country . Come again ? Let 's play the game . This is ridiculous ! I 'm not gonna bargain with a computer . If i 'm not mistaken , mr . Ellison , we 've got no choice . You hit him in the mouth , didn 't you ? Never aim for the mouth . What 's that ? Antibiotic . You know , one time when kyle and i were kids , we saw two tunnel trolls go at it over a can of stewed tomatoes . The loser got three teeth knocked out , and the winner got a blood infection from his split knuckles and died a week later . The human mouth is filthy . You got that ? Yeah . What ? Damn . John okay ? All right . Hold tight , i 'm on my way . John 's ... girlfriend is dead . A cyborg did it . You know that for sure ? Who else could it be ? What are you going to do ? About the metal ? What are you going to do ? Because you can 't kill her , derek . What ? That 's not something you can do . He has to make that decision on his own . You 've really thought this through . No . But i think about it . Just like you do . More depth charges . Shook us up a bit , but no damage . They want us to make a mistake . Reveal our position . A lot of metal in the water , captain . Barrage . Getting closer . Asw bots . How many ? Travel in packs , no way to tell . Mister gavin ? Gavin . Not asw bots . Oh , man . Oh , man . Kraken . We got a kraken . You sure ? Bet my life on it . Feed the sonar picture to tactical . Aye , ma 'am . You 're a big fellow , aren 't you ? And you 're very far from home . That can 't be right . Where are we ? Chief of the boat , status of our torpedo stock ? Two , maybe three i 'd consider worth using in a fight . Ready tube one . Hold for my order . Queeg . You can 't fight a kraken with one torpedo . Or three . We need to break contact and find a way around . Mister garvin , active sonar , please . One ping only . One ping , aye . Torpedo in the water . Closing fast . Maybe ... 40 seconds . Yes , status on my torpedo ? Torpedo ready , but- - thirty second fuse . Match our speed and bearing after breakaway . Fire . You heard him . Fire . Torpedo away . Still closing , 55 knots . You got us 20 degrees down bubble . Ahead , full . Queeg , you 're tak- - taking the boat to 729.8 meters . Crush depth . To the edge of crush depth . The kraken won 't be able to follow . The sonar will reflect off the thermocline layer . We 'll be- - invisible . We 're playing dead . Eight seconds to torpedo contact . Approaching crush depth . If he 's off by even a millimeter , for even a fraction of a second . He won 't be . This is what he does . Two detonations . Our torpedo and theirs . 1,100 meters to starboard . 120 on the z . And now we roll over , stick out our tongue , and hold our breath . Skipper , we 're at 729.8 . I 'm aware , chief . Thank you . 729.8 ... and holding . You may return to your duty stations now . You heard the captain , people . What , you 've never been 20 centimeters from your maker before ? Move . Skipper , when we 're done skating over our deaths ... i got a question . Why are we 300 miles off course ? We were using it for research . To find out what makes them- - don 't . John , just don 't . Don 't make excuses for her . Don 't cover for her . I knew about the parts . I 'm not talking about the parts . I 'm talking about riley . Well , there 's nothing to talk about , is there ? Because riley 's dead . How do you think that happened ? I don 't know . I 'm gonna figure it out , though . You know , john . We both know . No . Cameron didn 't do it . How can you say that ? How can you be so sure ? Because i 'm sure . And i know her . And she told me . She told you ? Just like she told you she destroyed every part we ever captured ? Just like she tells us what she does every night when we go to sleep ? When she comes back in the morning , she 's covered in cuts and bruises . Hey , just like she told you she loved you ? I 'm thinking of an herb . Tarragon ? No . We 're wasting time . But it 's working . His game . What is wrong with you ? Why are you not angry ? Why should i be ? We have a way to get her back . Tell me where the child is . Look . You asked me to teach him ethics , morals , and rules . What good is it if he 's not gonna follow them ? He will . If we let him learn the rules on his own . Oregano . Correct . See there . A lucky guess . Lucky . Give us our clue . The sun is shining on savannah . Security . Check near all windows . Anyplace light is coming through . Copy . I 'm thinking of an animal . Antelope . No . Lion . No . Horse . No- - bird ! Correct . Give us our clue . The answer is the clue . What ? What does that mean ? Just what he said . Bird is our clue . I know where she is . Security . Meet us at the elevators . Savannah , are you okay ? Go to your mother . You found me , mommy . Yes , darling ... i did . Hey . Aaron ? John . I remember . Is riley around ? No , she didn 't come home last night . Riley didn 't come home . Thanks . Foster kids ... that 's the way it is with them sometimes . They drift into your life , then they drift back out again . Not always according to plan . She 's a tough one , too . Good heart , as i 'm sure you know , but ... tough to know . Well , i really really needed to talk to her . I don 't know if you could maybe just take a message for me- - hang on a sec . Hello ? Riley ! God , riley ! Are you all right ? Where are you ? Everything 's fine . I 'm in riverside , it 's a long story . Everything 's fine . We 've been worried sick . We were about to call the police . Please don 't do that . Everything 's fine . John , too ... he 's here . John ? Really ? Can i talk to him ? Me ? Riley ? You 're in riverside ? Okay . Well , listen ... we 'll talk when i see you . I thought you 'd wanna hear my voice . You know you 're really freaking everybody out , right ? Am i freaking you out , now ? Yes . So let 's talk later . I 'm sorry . It 's just ... i 've been thinking about my parents a lot . And there are things i can 't get out of my head . And i just thought if i came out and saw where we used to live ... i know ... stupid , right ? Okay . Well , we 'll talk about all this in person . Yeah ? When you get back . We 're hanging up now . John ? Yeah , sure . That would be great . John . Yep ? I love you . Okay , bye . What the hell was that about ? What was what about ? What happened just now . It was the plan . No . The plan was to call the foster parents . The plan was to let him hear her voice . That 's what i did . That 's not all you did . What you did was not the plan . The plan was to make him think she 's still alive ... so he wouldn 't go to the police . You became part of that plan . Your reaction made it more authentic . Don 't you think it was more authentic that way ? Where are we going now ? We 're not going anywhere . I 'm going somewhere . And i 'm going to go alone . You shouldn 't be alone . Yes , i should . Did you have fun playing the game , mr . Ellison ? No , john henry . I did not . Why not ? Because what you did made me very , very angry . I don 't understand . You kept a secret . Is it wrong to keep a secret ? The secret you kept could 've harmed savannah . What if we couldn 't have found her ? What if she 'd fallen from the roof and died ? Then she wouldn 't be alive anymore . And her life is important . Human life is sacred . If she had died ... it would 've been your fault . My fault ? Because you were the only one who knew where she was . And you made a choice not to tell . That was the wrong choice . Derek ? I 'm thinking about riley . What the cyborg did to her . It 's a terrible thing . But , um ... if john realizes what the metal is ... what it really does ... maybe some good can come of it . Maybe you can help him see that . Good ? An innocent kid is dead . Because that metal bitch murdered her in cold blood . No good comes out of that . None . Not ever . You 're a good man . Oh , yeah ? Don 't let anyone tell you different . We 've been bearing 30 degrees off course for four hours . Into a major skynet zone . What 's going on ? Our new mission required it . What mission ? Where are we headed ? A deepwater oil platform near the indonesian archipelago . Lieutenant dietz and his team will board the rig and retrieve a package . We will deliver this package to seranno point . We have important cargo to take to perth . Components . Vaccines- - our orders come from john connor . These orders from john connor ... do they say what we 're after ? What it is ? Yes . They say what the package is . Right . Please inform the crew . Thank you . Just stay sharp , you 'll be fine . Oh , i know i 'll be fine . I got this . I 'm serious , dietz . I 'm always serious about being fine . You do me one favor . You see anything you don 't like out there , you think before you pull that trigger . I 've been seeing things i don 't like since j-day . You don 't get to be my age without thinking first . I swear , mom . We 'll hold hands before we cross the street . A.s.d.s. Has cut engines , commander . I think we 're clear for comms . A.s.d.s. , this is carter . Over . Hey , mom . I 'll say this much about a deep-sea oil rig ... second-worst thing i 've ever smelled . Dark as night out here . We 're gonna keep this channel open . Maintain radio silence till you 've got the package . Planning on it . Connor sent me . John connor . I 've come for that . That 's for him . I 'm just here to pick it up . i had planned on waiting for you with derek 's sniper rifle . Pulled the trigger . Solved about 50 % of my problems . One shot . Do you know how bad i 'd have felt ? Very bad . Not bad at all . But i know someone who 'd have felt bad . Someone who 'd have never forgiven me if i 'd have done that . I don 't know what to do with you . You know what the stakes are . You know why we 're here . You know what this means . And yet , here i stand . Burning what 's left of an endoskeleton i 'd thought we 'd burned months ago . I needed spare parts . I don 't care what you need , because this is not about you . No . It 's not about me . It 's about john . You 're concerned for his safety . You bet i am . From skynet . From me . Maybe . Maybe especially you . We 're all a threat . We 're all a threat to john . He worries about us . That makes him vulnerable . He cares . I am not john 's problem . John is john 's problem . Humans are the problem . There 's only one way for him to be safe . That 's to be alone . What kind of life is that ? John 's life . Someday . I 'm sorry .

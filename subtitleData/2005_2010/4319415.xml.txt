 ( 4400-S3E02-Being Tom Baldwin ) ( dramatic theme playing ) We 're not a threat . We 're salvation . The world will have to deal with us . Previously on The 4400 : Lily , are you all right ? Where 's my wife ? What are you talking about ? Mr. Tyler , when your wife fainted this morning , she was a young woman . When she woke up less than a minute later , she was 50 years older ? Are you my mother ? Richard , I 'm dying . ROSS : I understand there was an incident this morning . You attempted to harm yourself . You had no right to do that ! Don 't you understand who you are ? What you 're here to do ? I 'm injecting myself with a modified version of the promicin serum . I have taught my body how to produce promicin . And then I will be the first non-returnee to develop 4400 abilities . That was T.J. Kim running from the courthouse . When she hit this place , T.J. drove every man in the building into a homicidal rage . Ever since we took them off the inhibitor , they 're either developing new abilities , or they 're refining the ones that they 've got . So they are getting more dangerous . You saved my life . I owe you . ( silenced gunshot ) ( gasps ) You sold us out . Won 't guess we 'll be seeing her in court anytime soon . You okay ? MAN ( distorted ) : This is a message from the Nova Group . We are the defensive wing of the 4400 . Today , the world has seen what happens to those who try to harm us . A new era dawns . ( tense theme playing ) Hi . I need your auxiliary rounds as well , Agent Baldwin . Oh , yeah . Pfft . Of course . I forgot again . Thanks . You can go in . Great . ( door buzzes ) Hi , T.J. What do you want ? Dr. Burkhoff ? I have your prescriptions . Hello ? Say something if you 're here . No , don 't . Please . I 've been having migraines . How severe ? ( laughs ) Bad enough . Don 't worry . They 're just headaches . I 've been getting them for years . ( alarm beeping ) ( moans ) 7 : 45 . You 're just in time for my wake-up call . These promicin shots , how many a day are you up to now ? ( coughs ) Six . You 've doubled your dosage ? I thought you weren 't going to do that without talking to me . We 're talking now . Look , I 'm training my body to produce a new neurotransmitter . And I guarantee you , I 'm not the only one trying . The moment the first 4400 manifested an ability , an arms race began . Someone is going to produce a promicin serum that will cause non-4400s to develop extraordinary abilities . It will happen . And the only questions are , who 's going to do it ? And who 's going to control it ? Hopefully , someone with a highly developed sense of responsibility . And some judgment . Let me ask you . Do you meet many people like that in your day-to-day affairs ? Do a lot of them hold high-ranking government posts or sit on the board of giant pharmaceutical companies ? Dr. Burkhoff , I knew that you had some personality quirks , but I never pegged you for a cynic . I can 't afford to have a charitable view of human nature . There 's too much at stake here . If these experiments cost me some headaches , some sores , I 'd say that 's a price worth paying . Wouldn 't you ? I 'm here , right ? ( mysterious theme playing ) ( gasps ) Holy Mother ! Why are we doing this ? Everything I 'm telling you , it 's all in my file . You know it already . Relax , T.J. I just think it 's important we review everything you told the government so far . Have we ? Yes . I keep telling you , yes . That 's everything I know . Okay . Thanks for your cooperation . We 're just trying to consolidate information . You 'd be amazed how hard that can be in a bureaucracy . Yeah , well , I hope you don 't expect me to say , " You 're welcome . " ( chuckles ) What are you doing ? Hmm ? What , this ? It 's nothing . I 'm just wrapping up the interview . ( tense theme playing ) ( Amanda Abizaid 's " A Place in Time " playing ) ¶ La , la , la , la ¶ ¶ So long ago ¶ ¶ Another life ¶ ¶ I could feel Your heart beat ¶ ¶ It 's not a dream Remember us ¶ ¶ I can see it in your eyes ¶ ¶ We 'll find a place in time ¶ ¶ A place in time Beyond the sun ¶ ¶ We 'll find Our place in time ¶ ¶ A place in time To call our own ¶ ¶ Ooh-ooh-ahh-ooh ¶ ¶ Ooh-ooh-ahh-ooh-ahh ¶ ¶ Ooh-ahh-ahh-ooh ¶ ¶ Ooh-ooh-ahh-ohh-ahh-ahh ¶ Get geared up . We 're leaving in two minutes . What for ? What 's going on ? Your partner registered to see T.J. Kim this morning . When Tom left the interview room , T.J. was dead . What ? Two gunshot wounds to the head . Apparently , Tom snuck a small firearm into the interrogation room . By the time the guard went into the room and found T.J. ' s body , Tom had already left the building . I 'm going to pick him up now . Wait , wait . This is Tom we 're talking about here . I mean , there 's gotta be some explanation . Now maybe T.J. used her ability on him . No , she had concentrated promicin inhibitor pumping through her veins . Now we tried to contact Tom , but he hasn 't been picking up his phone . We need to get him in here , figure out what happened . Okay . But just let me talk to him first . He trusts me . Look , this is Tom . Come on , we owe him that much . Yeah , okay . ( radio chatter ) I wasn 't trying to drown myself . I don 't even know if I could . Okay . Isabelle , I just thought that after everything that happened with Lily- - Shawn , this has nothing to do with my mother . I was teaching myself to swim . ( scoffs ) In your clothes ? Well- - I never wore a bathing suit before . I didn 't know what to get . And I 'm too old to ask for help . It 's embarrassing not knowing how to swim . Everybody 's gotta learn sometime , Isabelle . I learned when I was a kid . But I never was a kid . That 's why I never learned how to swim or how to drive or ever went out on a date . I keep reading about all these rites of passage . Like stuff everyone goes through before they grow up ? Yeah . Yeah , but I am grown up . And I missed out on all of it . It 's not fair . I 've gotta catch up , so I made a list . A list ? That 's pretty organized . Well , Isabelle , there is a pool at the Center . I could probably teach you the basics . Really ? Mm-hmm . Thanks , Shawn . Mm-hmm . Dad ? How old were you when you learned how to swim ? Huh . Oh , uh ... about 11 , I guess . Why ? You want me to teach you ? That 's okay . Shawn said he 'd do it . Oh , he did , did he ? Mm-hmm . Well , make sure he doesn 't throw you in the deep end right away . That 's what my grandmother did to me . Look , uh , Isabelle , I 'm gonna be gone overnight . If you need anything , go see Shawn . Where are you going ? I 'm gonna take your mother home . I 'm putting her to rest . Well , can I come with you ? I don 't think so . I 'm flying , and , uh- - To tell you the truth , I don 't think you 're ready to be away from the Center yet . You wanna be alone with her when you say goodbye , don 't you ? Yeah , I guess I do . ( ominous theme playing ) Tom . Oh , God ! You scared the hell out of me , Diana . What are you doing here ? Why is your gun out ? What the hell is going on ? Jarvis is on her way over . She 's got everyone with her . You need to come in . Why ? What are you talking about ? You shot T.J. Kim this morning . What ? You don 't remember ? Don 't remember ? I didn 't shoot anybody . I 've been here all morning . Can someone confirm that ? No . No , I was supposed to have a conference call with Kyle 's attorneys . They cancelled , though . Look , I took a half a personal day , Diana . I went jogging . I wasn 't- - I wasn 't at work . You gotta stop saying that , because two dozen people saw you there . Look , I don 't know what 's going on . I- - Maybe you 're blacking out like Kyle did . Maybe it 's something else . Maybe it 's like some ... 4400 ability . I mean I don 't know , but ... you gotta come in . And what happens if I do ? I get arrested for murder ? You know , we 'll figure it out , okay ? Everyone wants to help you . You just- - You just have to come in . Well , you mind if I get dressed first ? Oh . Sure . Are you sure you remember everything you did this morning ? Like , there 's no time gaps or anything ? You didn 't take a nap ? Because Tom ... Tom ? Damn it ! Yeah , hi . It 's me . He got away . I- - I don 't know how . They only sent one agent after him . Look , sorry . He got away . What ? No way . He 's an NTAC agent . He 'll be expecting that . Okay . You 're right . This has to happen . I 'll do it . I was letting him get dressed . I didn 't think he would jump from a second-story window . Well , obviously you underestimated your partner 's resolve . Well , does he still seem blameless to you ? I don 't know . Look , it was a really bad call , and I take full responsibility . I 've alerted local law enforcement , the FBI . I 've told them that Tom is wanted for questioning in connection with the murder . He 's a fugitive now . Oh , don 't give me that look , Diana . I had no choice . ( cell phone rings ) Sorry . It 's Tom . Yeah . Tom . Sorry I ran out on you . Where are you ? I didn 't kill T.J. , I didn 't kill anyone . I believe you , but you have to come in , and we can figure it out . No , I 'm not going to jail . No one 's gonna put you in prison . They did it to my son , Diana . Was it really him that pulled the trigger the day Jordan Collier died ? No , it wasn 't , was it ? It was that thing inside of him . And where 's Kyle ? He 's incarcerated . You 're a fugitive , Tom . Every police department in Washington is looking for you . Now if some local cop who wants to be a hero spots you , you know how these things can end . It 's gonna end with me proving I didn 't do this . Look , dig around , Diana . There 's got to be some evidence that 'll clear me . Just ... help me find it . Did he give you a location ? Marco , help me out here . If you were trying to prove that your partner didn 't commit a crime that the whole world thinks he did , where would you start ? Well , I ... guess I 'd start by pretending that my partner wasn 't involved . Okay , just think of it like any other case . I mean , what 's the first thing you do when you start ? Well , look at the evidence . I mean , there 's a dead body . There 's the gun that Tom left behind . And there 's a bunch of people that saw him here . Well , they got security cameras down in the detention ward , right ? You 're serious ? You 're really asking me for all that footage ? Of course I 'm serious . Is that a problem ? Well , it 's just ... I gave all the tapes to him , like , an hour ago . Whoa . What are you talking about ? I haven 't been up here all day . What is this , a joke ? Marco , come on . You were just here . You signed for the footage from the detention ward . This isn 't so hard . That 's because I haven 't let go yet . All right , I 'm gonna move my hands . Are you ready ? No , not yet . I 'm kind of comfortable . You 're kind of comfortable ? I 'm freezing . I don 't know what 's going on . This pool is supposed to be heated . Want me to make it warmer ? Oh , you can do that ? I think so . Hold on . ( thunder rumbles ) How do you do that ? I don 't know . How do you heal ? That 's not the same , Isabelle . Healing is one thing . That 's what we can all do , one thing . Not me . I guess I 'm different . Shawn ? I 'm sorry to barge in . We 're scheduled to brief the board of directors . That 's starting now ? Five minutes ago . They 're on hold . BALDWIN : Psst . ( whispers ) : Alana . Thomas . What are you doing here ? Shhh . I 'm in trouble . My bosses at NTAC , they think I did something . I need you to come with me . What are you talking about ? I don 't have time to explain . Just- - Thomas ! ( cell phone rings ) Hello ? BALDWIN : Alana . I 'm right down the street . I need you to come meet me . Honey , I 'm in trouble . Everyone thinks I killed somebody . Who is this ? I know it 's not Thomas . What are you talking about ? I 'm looking at Thomas right now . Honey , listen . That 's not me . The man you 're looking at , he can impersonate me somehow . I don 't believe you . He walked into NTAC and he shot someone this morning . Come on . Alana , he 's dangerous ! Get away from him . Alana , listen . Your mother 's middle name is Madeleine . You wanted a dog when you were a kid , but your parents gave you a bird . A parakeet named Charlie . Listen , we made love last night . There were two candles burning . Just hold on . I 'll be right there . Did I have a dog when I was a girl ? I don 't have time for this . What are you doing ? Let me go ! What 's going on , Tom ? Are you all right ? Yes . Where is he ? He just went through the back . Hey ! Did you see a guy come down this alley ? He looked exactly like me . I didn 't see anybody . You sure ? He 's gone . Where ? He 's gone . What do you mean ? He just ran out a few seconds ago . There was no one here . Just some kid- - It was him . It had to be . I had him . I had him . Had who ? What kid are you talking about ? The one who 's impersonating me . The guy who 's framing me for murder . He looked like you . He sounded like you . He was standing as close as you are to me right now . And he had me completely fooled . Don 't feel bad . He fooled everyone at NTAC too . At least we know what 's going on now . He 's a 4400 , isn 't he ? Yes . Somehow he can pass himself off as you . Yeah , I 'm not sure how . I mean , maybe he 's got some kind of optical camouflage . He can convince your brain you 're talking to whoever he wants you to see . He 's a boy . Why would he want to kill anyone ? Not just anybody . T.J. Kim . The one member of the Nova Group we had in custody . I mean , think about it . It 's a good plan . You get rid of the one member of your cell who could testify against you . You compromise a government agent . And NTAC , the one agency that 's trying to hunt you down , is wasting their time chasing one of their own . Alana . You might want to get in here . There 's all kind of people flashing badges everywhere . They said they 're NTAC agents . Look , stall them . I want you to go home . I want you to lock the doors and don 't open it until this is all cleared up . If I need to get a hold of you , I 'll use a password . How about Death in Venice ? Your favorite book . It 's a good choice . BALDWIN : Listen , Shawn , thanks for letting me come in here . I- - I know it puts you at risk . I just didn 't know where else to go . Look , you guys must have a database of 4400s here , right ? Yeah . I need to get a look at it . Okay . Find out who this kid is . Here . I can pull it up on my laptop for you . Great . This might take a while . Do you mind if I let myself out ? No , that 's fine . There you go . You know , Tom , you can stay here if you want . I might take you up on it . All right . But , hey , you get the couch . ( chuckles ) Okay . Kidneys , huh ? That explains the blood in the urine . Kevin , we had a deal . I was going to help you through this as long as it wasn 't compromising your health . Well , guess what , I 'm calling the hospital . But they won 't let me take my shots . Oh , no . You 're done with your shots . I know we had an agreement . And I 'll honor it . Just- - Let me show you something before you call . What happened to your fingernails ? They fell off . Dissolved , I guess you 'd say . God , if you 're trying to change my mind , you 're not doing a very good job- - ( screams ) ( screams ) Kevin , what the hell did you just do ? ( gasps ) Your tissue is healing itself from trauma that quickly ? Kevin , you 've developed a 4400 ability . It 's getting there . Doesn 't always work . Doesn 't always work ? You just put a scalpel through the back of your hand . I know . I was nervous about that . ( brakes screech ) ( gasps ) These are fun to drive fast . Yeah . You know , all that information about compression rates , and- - And gear ratios just seems completely irrelevant . Well , you 're not driving home . Get out of there . ( laughs ) ( sighs ) You 're lucky you didn 't wrap my car around a pole . Is there anything on this list of yours that involves , you know , a little less risk of bodily harm ? We could have sex . Come on , you have a big bed . Isabelle . Hey , hey . Uh , no . Why ? It 's on my list . It 's an important rite of passage into adulthood . It 'll be fun . I was good at driving . I 'm sure you 'd catch on real quick . I don 't know . For one thing , your dad would kill me . Why ? I 'm an adult . Well , you are , and you aren 't , Isabelle . Let 's just say , he has a right to have an opinion on the matter . I don 't know , Isabelle . I feel like I 'd be taking advantage of you . But I want to . Well , I 'm flattered . I really am . But I just don 't think you 're ready to make that decision . We barely know each other . I know you better than I know anyone else in the world . That may be true . It 's still not gonna happen . Lessons with Isabelle going well ? Not lessons , and it 's completely innocent . Do me a favor and don 't ask about them again . ( phone ringing ) This is Skouris . His name is Boyd Gelder , Diana . He 's a 4400 . I know where he lives . Where who lives ? Who 's Boyd Gelder ? The kid who 's doing this . He can imitate me somehow . And not just imitate . He can be me . At least , make you think he 's me . He lives with his mom . I 'm in Schenley Park . It 's right by his house . Well , can you wait for me ? I 'll be 15 minutes . I 'll wait . But , Diana , just you . Just me . We just got here . Where are you going ? Schenley Park . I think we caught a break on Tom 's case . Tom ! Tom ! ( tense theme playing ) ( kids cheering ) I didn 't tell anyone , Tom . Just Marco . At least I thought it was Marco . BALDWIN : I looked across the park . You were standing there . It was you . But it wasn 't . Listen , tell me about it . You weren 't the one actually chasing yourself across the park . I mean , I don 't really run like that , do I ? It 's an amazing ability . Marco 's gonna have a field day over this . Good . Get him working on it . We 're gonna need a way to handle this guy when we get him into custody . Well , wait . Wait . Wait . No , you don 't need to skulk around anymore . You can come in with me , now . I 'm still on the hook for murder , Diana . No , you 're not . Boyd posed as you . He shot T.J. Kim . You 're not responsible . Listen , I just saw his abilities with my own eyes . That 's proof of something right there . I will back you up on everything you say . Which means exactly nothing . Thank you , Diana , but you 're my partner . Everyone expects you to stand up for me . There 's only one way to prove I didn 't kill T.J. Kim . I have to get Boyd Gelder . Okay , let 's go . You 're sure you want to come ? I 'm your partner . Everyone expects that I 'll stand up for you . I should be back by tonight . I 've ... been taking my time , stopping off at all the places your mother liked . Everything okay ? You been going to your doctor 's appointments ? Most of them . Isabelle . We 'll need to keep monitoring you . I 'm fine . Shawn 's been taking good care of me , just like you asked . He 's doing a really good job . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . He taught me the back stroke . He let me drive his car . And then I asked him to have sex with me , but he said no . He said you 'd be angry if we did . Is that true ? Isabelle , you 're too young to be thinking about ... that . I am ? But I thought I was almost 20 . What- - ? How old were you when you lost your virginity ? It was- - Things were a bit different in my days . It 's not the same . It 's not ? Why ? You know what , Isabelle ? I 'm not having this conversation with you over the phone . So Shawn was right . You are mad . I don 't understand . What does NTAC want to talk to my son for , anyway ? Look , he 's in some trouble . We can 't discuss , We just need to talk to him . Well , he 's not here . He went away on a ski trip with some friends and won 't be back till tomorrow . Ma 'am , your son is not on a ski trip , and this is serious . Is there any way you can contact him ? First , tell me what 's going on . I mean , what is it you think my son did ? Mrs. Gelder , there are a lot of agents looking for Boyd . Situations like this can get very chaotic . People get hurt . The sooner we get to your son , the safer he 'll be . So why don 't you call him and convince him you need to see him ? SKOURIS : Boyd 's late . I wonder if he 'll even show . BALDWIN : Let 's just give him another few minutes . Nice mom . Nice house . It makes you wonder . If the Nova Group can turn this kid , who else have they gotten to ? Everyone keeps telling the 4400 they 're here to save the world . Whatever that means . Exactly . I mean , say what you like about Nova , but they do seem to have a game plan . I 'm sure that helps their recruiting pitch . Well , I 'm just guessing , but I don 't think that 's Boyd . How the hell did NTAC get here ? Maybe Boyd figured out it was a trap and tipped them off . ( suspenseful theme playing ) Thomas . Alana , open up . What are you doing here ? There are NTAC agents watching the house . They just drove away . They must be changing shifts or something . Come on , let me in . Death in Venice , okay ? Open up . I don 't want anyone to see me standing out here . Come on . What did you do with your key ? I lost it . I must have lost it while I was running around . Come on , it 's me . Tom , Alana . I gave you the password . Please don 't make me . I don 't have anything against you . ( tense theme playing ) ( cell phone ringing ) Tom , it says it 's your house . Alana ? BOYD ( as Baldwin ) : I just wrote a letter on your computer . You need to come sign it . Boyd ? It 's a confession . It says you cracked under the strain of the murder charges against your son . You shot T.J. , and now you can 't live with it . So you 've decided to kill yourself . Where is Alana ? What did you do ? ( laughs ) It 's my " get out of jail free " card . See , you 're the only one who can identify me . Everyone else ? They 've just been seeing double . They 'll sound crazy . I 'm not signing a suicide note , Boyd . Put Alana on the phone . Oh , you 'll sign . Because either I shoot you or I shoot her . It 's a trade . Your life for hers . You know what ? I don 't think I can let you do this , Tom . We need to call Jarvis . We need to block off the street . We need to surround your house . He has Alana . Tom , he wants to kill you . The least that we can do , is make it a little bit difficult for him . If it was Maia in there , would you call Jarvis ? Do you like it ? Why did you bring this to me ? You 're a young woman . A young woman should have a nice dress . It 's gonna look good on you . See for yourself . Thank you . I see you 've been spending a lot of time with Shawn . So ? I think it 's wonderful . Shawn 's a very isolated young man . He doesn 't get to spend much time around people his own age . I think you should get as close to him as you can . Matthew ? Mmm ? Shawn 's nice . But what I 'm doing with him is not for you , and it 's not because I 'm trying to use him . Of course not . But eventually , Isabelle , you and Shawn are gonna be on opposite sides of a very large ideological divide . So ... enjoy your friendship . But don 't let your emotions run too deep . If you do , it 'll make things more difficult later . What things ? You 'll know . It doesn 't match your eyes . You should take care of that . RICHARD : You were a beautiful woman . Both of you . You looked exactly alike . I never could figure out why . But one way or the other , I 've had a Lily in my life for over 50 years . That 's all gone now , and I don 't know what I 'm gonna do . But , uh ... it makes me feel better , knowing the two of you are together . Forever . ( pensive theme playing ) ( ominous theme playing ) ALANA : This is it for you , you know . I don 't know what kind of fairy tale the Nova Group sold you , but it doesn 't matter what happens to me , or Tom . Your life is over . They sent you on a suicide mission . I volunteered . And I don 't think you 're in any spot to be giving me advice . You 're a 4400 . You 're special . You 're supposed to be changing things . Instead , you- - Live with an NTAC agent . And what are you going to change , Boyd ? You killed a girl . How does that make the world better ? T.J. Kim was a soldier . She would rather have me put a bullet in her head than betray us . Everyone talks about saving the world . Meanwhile , for the past 50 years , everything 's been turning bad . One disaster after another . But we 're gonna show the world a new way . We 're gonna take them down a new path . By force if we have to . I mean , can 't you see ? The real catastrophe is to sit back and do nothing . ( rustle ) Did you hear that ? ( grunts ) ( grunting ) Stop it . Stop it , both of you . Stop or I 'll shoot . Nice work , Alana . We got him . Shut up ! Alana , Death in Venice . Yeah , that 's the password . Come on , Alana . Give me the gun . We 'll call NTAC . It 's over . ( tense theme playing ) Alana , it 's me , Tom . Ask me a question . Anything . Don 't fall for it . He 's probably read my file . He knows everything about us . Don 't listen to him . Ask me something about us . Something only I would know . Anything about us . Shut up , both of you . Baby , I am so proud of you . Billy would have been proud . You know about Billy ? Yeah . That was your son . He died in a car accident . Alana , he did research . Alana . Anyone could find that out . Give me the gun . Just give me- - Give me the gun . Alana , give me the gun . Don 't . Alana , give me the gun . Come on . Get down on the ground ! What ? No , no . You 've got the wrong one . Think about this . I said get down . Hold still , Boyd . Don 't move . You 're just a boy . I 'm a soldier . And there are more of us every day . Let 's go , soldier . ( grunts ) ( knock on door ) Hey . Welcome back . Yeah , thanks . Everything go okay ? Yeah , thank you . And thank you for keeping an eye on Isabelle . Oh , well , it 's not a problem . I didn 't really do much . Yeah , well , thank you anyway . I worry about her . Well , you don 't really need to . She seems to be getting along really well . I 'm her father , it 's my job . And it 's harder with Isabelle . People see her , they see a woman . A beautiful woman . And they might forget that inside , she 's just a little girl . Still , I 'm glad she has you around ... to be a friend .

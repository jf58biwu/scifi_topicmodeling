 You 're so sweet . I 've wanted you to meet my mom for so long . What made you want to do it today ? I just thought we should get away . Well , you made my day . I know things have been a little bumpy with us lately . Brett ? I 'm sorry . What 'd you say ? What 's going on ? What are they doing ? Brett ? I know . Hang on . Get down . Get down ! What the hell was that ? Oh my God , your shoulder ! You 've been shot . Who are those guys ? What are you doing ? We 're way past framing him now , sir . So ? Change of plans . No more snatch and grab ? Guy wanted for killing an assistant D.A. runs off with his girl ... How does that make him look ? Desperate . Guilty as sin . You know , desperate people , capable of anything , even murder . Murder-suicide ... My specialty . You ever wonder why they picked him ? If I were you , I wouldn 't ask . I don 't understand . Who were those guys ? - What did they want from us ? - I don 't know . - Brett , you must go to a hospital . - No . No hospitals , no cops . But those guys just tried to kill us . And we need to get as far away from here as possible . - You 're a cop ! Call for backup ! - I can 't do that . Why ? 'cause the last time I was in the system , I got snatched out of county jail and ended up ... What are you talking about ? I can 't tell you . It won 't make any sense . - You are bleeding out . - Rita , please ! We 're gonna find a store , you 're gonna get supplies and you 're gonna patch me up . Please . Okay , stay calm . You can do this , all right ? Just go in there , get what you need . and I promise you , I will explain everything ... Everything to you as soon as I get you someplace safe . Okay ? - Hello . - Hey , it 's me . - Hopper , I can 't talk right now . - Just listen . I 'm being framed for Garza 's murder . - What ? - Two detectives , Spivak and Choi are gonna try and flip you against me , all right ? They 're gonna promise to get Internal Affairs off your back . Don 't believe them . All right , Andrea ? Please . Just ... we 're partners . I 'm sorry . I can 't do this right now . I 'm heading into I.A. - I 'll call you later . - Wait , wait . Andrea ... The ... Andrea ? Excuse me , ma 'am . Yes , officer ? Is everything all right ? Oh , my goodness . Right ... I 'm an E.R. Nurse , and there was ... A dog ? So what did you do with it ? Did you put it in your car ? I didn 't want to move him . He 's back up on the highway . I 'll call animal control . They 're used to handling these things . - You know what ? That 's okay ... - Get on the ground ! Get down on the ground . Come on . I had it . Five more seconds , - and we were out of here . - He was a county sheriff , Rita . Do you know what he sees on these roads ? And with all that blood on you , he was never gonna let you go . You were scared I was gonna tell him what really happened ? No ! I 'm just trying to get you out of trouble . Look , I don 't know what 's going on , but if we are to get through whatever is happening , - you are gonna have to trust me . - This isn 't about trust . It 's about keeping us alive . - Where have you been ? - I had to hide the truck . Once you patch me up , we can get outta here . And go where ? Once again , who were those men on the road - and why aren 't we calling the cops ? - It 's complicated . Try me . All right , short version ... I 've been set up for murder . An assistant D.A. was killed last night , And I think some cops are trying to frame me for it . Sit down . Okay , we need to sterilize it . This is gonna hurt . More than getting shot ? The bullet 's still in there . You need a surgeon . - You have to do it yourself . - Brett , I can 't . - Yeah , you can . You 've seen it done . - Yeah , at a hospital . But look where we are . I don 't have the tools to extract a bullet . All right . Now you do . A year in Vice , a year in the Hate Crime unit . Last 2 years , narcotics working a 3-men buy team ? - That 's right . - Rough trade , narcotics . With all the scum you gotta deal with junkies , crack whores ... it would make me sick . I don 't know . I 've found there 's scum in every line of work . Yeah , but the trick is you can 't let it get you dirty , 'cause that 's what brings you into our loving arms here in I.A. - You worried about what I got in here ? - Why would I be ? 'Cause it 's gonna cost you your career . We 've been watching you ... for weeks . What ? Your lucky day , Battle . Two guys from robbery homicide wanna talk to you . Spivak and Choi . It 's about Hopper . It 's definitely not fun being under the I.A. microscope . - We 've all been there . - Yeah , those guys think : " I pulled all this crap when I was on the streets so they must be doing it , too . " Wait a minute . You gotta watch that Shelton in particular . He 's a real crusader . Nutty bar ? I have to say right out front , I think you guys are both wrong about Hopper . Well , we respect your loyalty , but we got him cold . Gun , prints . Wait , you 've got Hopper 's prints on the murder weapon ? It 's a done deal . D.A. ' s office is going to miss Garza . Guy never shied away from the tough ones . One to the head , two the chest , - execution style . - Cop style . Just like they teach you at the academy . We want you to listen to something , maybe shed some light on it for us . Hopper , you should 've received a package today . It 's important . Don 't let anyone know you have it . You 'll be contacted soon . Who is that ? What package is she talking about ? I don 't know . Think it has something to do with Garza 's murder ? You know homicide always supersedes internal investigations . You cooperate with us here , we 'll make this whole Chad Shelton I.A. thing go away . When was the last time you spoke to Hopper ? Yesterday . Here we go . Hold on to something . I 'm sorry . It 's lodged deep in there . You 're lucky it didn 't hit a major artery . I know there 's a lot you 're not telling me . And although I should be used to it 'cause I know that 's your deal , it just sucks at a time like this . Could we not do this right now , please ? We need help , Brett . There must be somebody you trust . Yeah , you . What about Andrea ? - She 's not part of this ? - I don 't know . Anybody 's capable of anything . Did you get it ? Did you get it ? Sorry . We 're gonna have to try it again . You wanted to know who Miss Battle was talking to before she came in . Let me guess . Her sleazy little friend Slim . It 's a cell phone registered to a Rita Shelton . I 'm sure it 's not your ex . I wanna believe everything you said , Brett , but there 's something I don 't understand . If this Garza guy was murdered last night and this investigation took place overnight , how could you know about it ? You were with me the whole time . Okay , this is gonna sound like it 's impossible . But I need you to believe me . These past three days , I 've woken up ... And it 's the same day . It 's the same time , it 's the same place , it 's the same damn traffic report . I am living today over and over again . What are you talking about ? There 's this guy in a rock quarry , And he knows everything about you , me , Jen and the kids . And he wants me to confess to killing Garza . All right , and those guys ... Those guys on the road ... They work for him , and they caught me , and they stuck me with this big-ass needle twice . And ever since ... Andrea took that call not 10 minutes before you swiped her away from me . So detective Battle talked to your ex-wife . Big deal . Not my ex-wife . My ex-wife 's boyfriend . I think you 're in shock . I think you 've lost ... - a lot of blood . - I 'm not in shock . This is really happening to me . Okay ? I can prove it . There 's a truck accident today ... Spilled baby diapers . And the papers , all right ? Check the papers . The headlines are all about Garza . Oh , the Dodgers ! The Dodgers win today . Okay ? It 's the same game . It 's the same day . So what you 're saying is that we 've ... - We 've been at this motel before . - Yes . No . - But you 've been shot before . - No . - But they 've come after me . - Have we had this conversation before ? - I don 't understand . - I don 't understand either ... The day is the same , all right ? But different things happen . It depends . Like ... this lady at the coffee shop , One day I save her , next day ... She gets hit by a bus because I wasn 't there . You don 't see ? You don 't see . Yeah . Hopper , where are you ? Andrea ... they came to you , didn 't they ? Spivak and Choi , just like I said they would ? Look , Hopper , I want to help you . But I can 't unless you tell me where you are . You have to trust me . You cut a deal with I.A. to bring me in , yes or no ? I 'm not proud of it , okay ? I 'm sorry , Andrea . I can 't . So he is with her . You got a fix on that phone ? I 've been thinking ... You said something about needles . What if someone had given you an hallucinogen ? So none of this is happening ? No , no . That 's not what I 'm saying . I mean how could this have happened last night if you were with me the whole time ? It had to have happened yesterday or a few days ago . It was yesterday . Yesterday was today . Yesterday is ... today . Have you been having headaches ? Because maybe ... you 've hit your head . - Or maybe you just had a stroke . - Don 't you think I 've thought about this like a million times ? Looked for explanations ? Maybe I need an M.R.I ! Maybe I need a shrink ! Maybe I stepped on a damn time machine ! I don 't know ! Okay . I don 't understand how this is happening to me . I don 't know who 's doing it . I don 't know how to make it stop . I don 't know why . And right now , I don 't care . The only thing I care about right now is making sure that you 're ... What ? What is it ? You keep saying this is about keeping me safe . If you 're saying you 've lived this day before , what happens to me , Brett ? Nothing . Nothing . We 're fine . We 're together . You 're lying . Those guys that ambushed us on the road ... You think something happens to me . Listen to me . Listen to me . Nothing is going to happen to you . All we have to do is make sure we don 't get caught . Great . We 'll be there in 20 . Local county sheriffs are good for backup . They 'll meet us there , secure the roads , hang back till we say go . I still think we should 've brought S.W.A.T. You 're doing the right thing , you know . ... and the final score is in . Just moments ago , the Dodgers capped an amazing 7-run rally in the ninth inning to beat the Giants . Highlights coming up in sports . We 're also gonna take a look at ... I 'm sorry ... About your dress . It 's okay . I coulda sold that cop back at the store . I did try to save a stray once . He was hit on the highway ... This poor , scruffy mutt , bleeding . I was with Chad on our way to Vegas for our honeymoon . Anyway , I had him pull over . I could tell he was all broken inside . Chad didn 't want him in the car . And he said we should just leave him , let him die naturally . So we did . I 've washed blood off my hands before , but never yours . Get in the bathroom . She 's inside . How 'd you find me ? Give me some credit . I 'm a cop . What 's wrong with your shoulder ? He was shot . - Rita , you okay ? - Yeah , it 's him I 'm worried about . Did you come alone ? Yeah , of course . Look , I know the trouble you 're in , Hopper . And I want to help . But you have to be straight with me . Tell me what happened with Garza . Nothing happened with Garza . I don 't know the guy . You know me better than that , Andrea . Then that 's what you tell ' em when you turn yourself in . Forget about it . I 'm not going to jail . I didn 't kill Garza . So what are you gonna do ? Whatever it takes . Okay , Hopper , just calm down . All right ? We can fix this . Just don 't do anything drastic . She 's got 2 more minutes to do something , then we 're going in . Who are these guys ? How did they get past the checkpoint ? I said no cars in or out until we 're clear . Call your men and make sure they secure the road . Something 's not right . Get the vests . Listen . What 's wrong ? They found us . Hopper . We 're clear . New plan . Put the weapon down . - You guys run to the car . - I 'll cover you . - We can 't leave you . - I 've got back up . You don 't . - Andrea , I can 't let you do that . - Just shut up and listen . They 've got a gun with your prints on it . They played me some voice mail . A woman talking about some package they sent to you . They think it 's about Garza . Hopper , you should 've received a package today . It 's important . On three . You ready ? One ... Two ... Go ! Hopper ! Go . You were gonna meet my mom today . It 's gonna be okay . Just gotta keep going . It 's gonna be all right . Just gotta keep going . It 's gonna be a new day . It 's gonna be a new day . I just gotta keep going . Brett . Oh my God . Dr. Artlet , I.C.U. Dr. Miller , 5-7-2-3 . Jen . - Brett , it 's okay . - Where 's Rita ? Where 's Rita ? Is she okay ? Yeah . She 's just talking to the doctors . Lie back . Take it easy . Hopper ! Andrea got shot . Slow down . You lost a lot of blood last night . What happened to you ? They say you took a bullet . We got ambushed by these guys and ... Rita didn 't tell you ? She was there . We ... don 't worry . Your sister and the kids are okay . Jen , come on . You gotta get outta here . - It 's not safe . It 's not safe . Go . - Relax . It 's okay . Go . Go . You are all right , okay ? You 're all right . Relax . It 's just a mild sedative . We 'd like you to sleep on it . No , no needles . It 's just a sedative . No , relax . It 's okay . - You are all right . - This is impossible . They never gave me the shot . I never ... they never caught us . Detective Brett Hopper . You 're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza ... You two , out . Now . Well , since you asked so nicely . We 'll have an officer on the door . Yeah , I 'm sure you will . I 'll be back . I told you two he wasn 't ready to be moved . He seems fine to us . We 've called an ambulance to transport him . Until you get one , he 's ours . How can you treat one of your own like he 's some common criminal ? Our father was a cop . Ladies , please . We 're just trying to do our jobs . Ms. Shelton , you were with detective Hopper last night . - Is that correct ? - Yes , I was . So you can provide him with an alibi - for the entire night ? - Absolutely . So how did he get that bullet wound ? Yeah , I thought so . Let 's get an E.T.A. on that ambulance . We should talk to his partner , Battle . You worried about what 's in here ? Why would I be ? 'Cause it 's gonna cost you your career . We 've been watching you ... for weeks . Danny Yan . The guys at vice call him " Slim . " Runs a gentlemen 's club over in Chinatown . You 've done a lot of business with him . He 's a confidential informant . He 's a drug dealer , human garbage . Who helps us bring down bigger pieces of garbage . Really ? Where exactly are these hitters ? They 're not on your list of last arrests . Not every tip leads to a Colombian cartel . Well , tell me , how exactly are you paying Mr. Yan for these juicy little nuggets ? 'Cause there 's no official list of any C.I. payouts to him in the last couple of months . I haven 't filed them yet . I find it interesting that before every meeting with this confidential informant you make a withdrawal ... From your personal account . $ 1,000 here , $ 2,000 there . Tell me something , you seen Eddie lately ? What ? What ? Hopper 's been shot . He 's at the hospital . They 're saying he killed Garza . Took a bullet in the process . - You think Hopper ... - No . You ? Anybody 's capable of anything . I need to know what happened to you . We went to bed last night and everything was fine . Then I wake up and you 're covered in blood with a gaping hole in your shoulder . I mean , my God , Brett , it looked like somebody butchered you . It 's complicated . Try me . I thought I knew how to fix this day , but I can 't . It 's bigger than I thought . I don 't understand . All you need to know is that I am being framed for murder , and I need your help . You gotta trust me . This isn 't about trust . This is life and death . I almost lost you today . Do you have any idea how that feels ? Do you believe me when I say that I did not do this ? Yes . Well , help me . Help me get outta here so I can figure out who did . I 'm sorry , honey . Maybe you could just whip up some pasta for the kids tonight or take them out . Randall , don 't get angry . It 's my brother . He 's in bad shape . They 're saying that he can 't even be moved . Code blue . Brett ! - Why aren 't you in there ? - He was crashing . Nurses kicked me out when the alarms went off . Son of a bitch ! How many men do we have ? Three units on site , four more on the way . If his girlfriend 's with him , I 'll bring her in , too . - I 'll take the back . - I 'll meet security in the lobby . We have units on the front and rear . No , I said every exit . He does not leave this hospital . You dropped this . I gotta be better about that . - You know this woman ? - Not exactly . I need your keys . Up you go . Come on . You can 't run forever , Hopper . I don 't plan to . Then why make it hard ? Turn yourself in . To you guys ? For all I know , you planted that gun in my closet . Who said anything about a gun in your closet ? Come on ! Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! As soon as they find Choi , they 're gonna change frequencies , but until then ... we can listen in . What is that ? Well , let 's hope Choi records all of his case notes , like a good little homicide detective . Need to find this Damien , see where he fits . Next message tied to him or Garza ? Hopper , you should 've received a package today . They played me a voice mail . A woman talking about some package they sent to you . they think it 's something to do with Garza . I gotta go to my place . What if we just drive , right now ? What if we just run ? We can 't . Won 't solve anything . You woke up in a pool of blood this morning , and you can 't tell me how and you can 't tell me why . I 'm just trying to understand what we 're doing . I gotta find out who killed Garza and why they 're framing me for it . And the first step to finding some of those answers might be right there in that mailbox . What do you plan to do ? I 'm gonna stake my place out , make sure that cop 's alone , then I 'll figure something out . So this is what it 's like . - This is what 's like ? - A stakeout . You 've been on stakeouts with me before . What ? When ? Koko 's Manchurian barbecue . Koko 's ? No . That was our first date . That was a stakeout ? Wait , no . I ... Wait . I ... Okay . I had no choice . We were both doing that " are we more than friends " thing , and ... And ... I wanted to be , but I knew that if I canceled on you again , then you 'd ... That I 'd lose you , so ... Yeah , you probably would have . Right . I can get the cop away from the building . What 'd you do ? Don 't ask . You get the package ? No . The cops must have taken my mail . - I 'll get here earlier tomorrow . - Tomorrow ? What do you mean ? - Hello . - Rita , are you nuts ? - Aiding and abetting a fugitive ? - Who is it ? - Chad ... - Rita ? Rita ! - What are you doing ? - He 's in a room full of cops tracking your phone . Come on . We gotta go . What 's going on ? Yeah , hey , man . How 's it going ? You know , same old , same old .

 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles : What does this mean to you ? I keep seeing it , John . It means something . Weirdo . Kook . Nut . I 've been reading the dictionary . I don 't sleep . Whatever happened at the explosion flipped a switch . You don 't know what you do . I love you , you love me . - And your name is ? - It 's Riley . What , never brought a girl home ? - No . - Riley climbed out John 's window . - Now is not the time for this . - Well , when is the time ? You bring danger into Riley 's life . I 'm gonna see Riley even if everyone thinks it 's a bad idea . I understand that it 's a bad idea . Don 't worry about it and be happy you 're a machine . I 'm a machine . I can 't be happy . Anything yet ? I 've dumped about 50,000 websites . There are hundreds of companies with three dots in the logo . Organic fruit , candles , dog collars baby wipes , ice cream . Nothing screams Skynet like baby wipes and ice cream . Keep looking . It is something you saw in a dream . And written in blood on the wall , so it means something . Will you keep looking ? Tomorrow . I 'm beat . You never sleep . Make yourself useful . Most efficient killing machine ever invented . You got her doing laundry . You do never sleep . One glazed . One rainbow sprinkle . One cinnamon twist . - You never forget , do you ? - No . I don 't . So how was Mexico ? Did you get to see your buddy down there ? Where 's the rest of him ? - He was gone when we got there . - After you went all that way ? Bummer . Yes , it was a bummer . Is your brother still seeing that crazy blond ? Yes . It 's become a problem . She snuck out the window one night and left the alarm off . We got robbed . No way . Did you catch who did it ? Everything worked out fine . That 's a pretty Zen attitude . The robbed that smiles steals something from the thief . - You read Othello . - You asked me to . Did you like it ? - It was more violent than I expected . - I should 've warned you . No . Everything worked out fine . You 're not eating your doughnuts . Oh ... . Later . Do you have A History of California Field Artillery ? I 'm interested in the muzzle-loading rifles used during the Modoc Indian War . Uh , in the California room . I have a big week . Paper due on Thursday . Peter the Great 's war with the Turks and the technological modernization of Imperial Russia . It 's better than it sounds . What are you looking at ? Him . I know him . Not unless you 're about , oh , 110 years old . That photo 's from 1920 . See ? December 31st , 1920 . What was he doing in 1920 ? What is this picture from ? Famous New Year 's Eve speakeasy fire , during Prohibition . Forty-three people died . There were rumors someone threw a Molotov cocktail through the door . Lots of rivalries between the different speakeasy clubs . I need to know what happened to him . Hello . John ? Can you come get me ? Where ? What 's wrong ? 341 Grove Way in Van Nuys . Can you please just come ? Most periodicals from the ' 20s haven 't been transferred to digital so this could take a while . But fire that big , there 's always survivor stories . Like with the Titanic . You know , there 's only one Titanic survivor left : Millvina Dean . Of course , she was 2 months old when it happened so her story isn 't particularly instructive . - You 're a very happy person . - I am ? I don 't know that many happy people . Well , I guess that 's my own little survivor story . Of course , having bone cancer was like being the Titanic and the iceberg . So why do you wanna find out about this guy ? I 'm interested in the past . It affects everything in the future . Those who don 't know history are destined to repeat it . Or die . - What 's wrong ? - A little cold in here . It 's 76 degrees . Check this one . D6 . That 's him . That 's the guy from the fire . Who 's that other man ? Rudolph Valentino . The greatest silent-film star of all time ? Ugh . You kids today with your rock ' n ' roll and your obsession with medieval siege weapons . " Rudolph Valentino and Myron Stark at the premiere of The Sheik . " What was Stark doing there ? Living it up on the red carpet . I enjoyed your film very much , Mr. Valentino . Thank you . I thought your decision to return the gun to Lady Diana to protect herself from the caravan of thieves was misguided given that she was a security risk . Stark is shaking hands with Valentino , but look at his eye line . He 's looking at that man . Rupert Chandler . Check out that hat . We could search the city and county records for more on Stark . - Where are they ? - Basement . Vital Records . But it 's locked and I don 't have the key . You 'll have to come back in the morning and talk with Barry . Excuse me . Where are you going ? Excuse me . Hi . - Looking for someone ? - Uh , yeah , Riley . Blond girl ? Uh ... . I barely know Mike 's friends . Gail Silver , Mike 's mom . Oh , hi . I 'm John . Let me help you with these . Oh ... . - This is the wrong kind . - You said " beer . " How come you never introduced me to your friend John ? Because he 's not my friend . He 's some loner weirdo who dropped out of school . - What are you doing here ? - Just looking for somebody . And being helpful . You could learn a lesson from him . What , like sucking up to Mom ? TV in your room broken ? Hard to relax if you 're out here . I gotcha . I 'm going . I didn 't know you could just send your mom to her room . Yeah , so ? Who you looking for ? Girl named Riley . I know Riley . - I got your beer . - Thanks . Okay , thanks . Hi . What are you doing ? You called me all upset . What 's going on ? Oh , that was just- - This guy was bothering me . That 's all . - Well , I have a car , let 's go . - No , it 's cool now . - Come on , we can hang out . - Hang out ? I only came to get you . I 'm sorry . It 's cool . We can stay . - Are you trying to get me fired ? - No . - Then what are you doing down here ? - Looking for records on Myron Stark . I don 't think he was who everyone thinks . I let you in , after hours , whenever you want . And for you to go and do this ? Exactly what I tell you not to ? - Really not cool . - Well , I need the information . And I need this job . You broke the lock . - I 'll fix it . - Just put it back . Put it all back . Don 't . I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have gone down there . Forget it . It 's no big deal . Yes , it is . We 're friends . I don 't really have many friends . Actually , I don 't have any friends . You ? That can 't be true . So did you find anything out down there ? No . There 's no record of Myron Stark before the fire . - Dead end . - I don 't like dead ends . He could 've been an immigrant . Came through Ellis Island . Shortened his name . Worked his way up from nothing . It 's the immigrant spirit . Single-minded pursuit of a goal . Never giving up . Buying into the American dream . An effective strategy . Either that or he robbed banks . What ? Can you show me police records ? Shortly after 2 p.m. , a lone robber held up the La Brea Savings and Loan . Witnesses say the masked man , armed with a submachine gun and a daring disregard for human life , opened fire . Eight citizens were felled and did not live to tell about it . This is the third bank robbed in recent weeks . Detective , can you tell us how much was looted from the vault ? Over 70,000 in cash , silver and liberty bonds . Was the robber injured in the fray ? Police let fly with a hail of bullets . The robber was hit with 30 rounds , but escaped on foot . How in God 's name did he survive ? That has not been ascertained . A manhunt is under way . You really think he robbed banks ? It 's a very effective strategy . But why ? What did he need it for ? To buy into the American dream . Stark bought parcels of land in the San Fernando Valley ... - ... Burbank , Sunland , Van Nuys . - Two days after the last heist . What 'd he do with all that land ? He built houses . I found this application for a business license . Construction . This is Worldwide News . Myron Stark versus Rupert Chandler . A classic David versus Goliath . Real-estate magnate and builder Rupert Chandler was the undisputed king of the expanding San Fernando Valley . But along came a young upstart , Myron Stark . What started as a one-man operation soon grew into a thriving business that went head-to-head with the largest builder in the county . Stark spoke six languages , paid double his competitors and treated all of his workers equally regardless of their employment history or citizen status . Stark himself could always be found shoulder to shoulder with his workers , a pickax in his strong hands . Soon Stark became a thorn in the side of his rival . His meteoric rise threatened to topple the king Chandler from his throne . Chandler 's top foreman , Fred Jeffers , was recently asked about the rivalry . To hear Jeffers tell it , " We 're not worried . Fly-by-nights like Stark come and go . Chandler 's an established company with contracts booked through 1925 . We 'll crush him like a bug . " Upon hearing Jeffers ' fighting words Stark was reported to reply simply , " We 'll see . " Here 's more on Chandler and Jeffers , and something really strange . Fred Jeffers , Rupert Chandler 's man , went missing back in 1925 . Was never found . What is this ? A 17-round Glock 9 mm semiautomatic . - Why do you have it ? - In case I need it . Have you ever used it ? - Yes . - Are you in trouble ? No . - Are you afraid of someone ? - Afraid ? No . I 've seen cuts on your face . There was one last week . You were wearing makeup , but- - Sometimes I get into fights . - Why ? - My brother . There are people out to hurt him . I protect him . - Who protects you ? - I do . Why are we doing this ? Why is Myron Stark so important ? He was doing something and it doesn 't make sense to me . I need to find out what it was . None of this makes sense to me . Not you , not the gun , not the guy in the photograph . I know . I never fired a gun before . Do you want to ? Sure , but- - Wait . No . No . We can 't do this here . Grip it with both hands . Squeeze the trigger slowly . Slowly . Oh ... . Game over ! Oh ... . - Yeah . - Oh , my God , I 'm terrible at this . - John ? - No , I don 't know how . What , you live in a cave ? Come on . What am I supposed to do ? I have no idea . I just pushed those buttons at random . And you sucked . Hey , check you out , Mr. Normal . Kill him , Alex . Come on , Johnny . I 'm rooting for you . Dude , you suck . Hey , come on . Kill him , Alex . Boom ! - I 'm gonna go . Stay if you want . - John , wait . - This was a mistake . - I 'm coming with you . Whoa , whoa . You 're going ? With that weirdo ? Yeah . I 'm sorry . We have to go . No , no , wait . Give me my lighter back . Your what ? - You took my lighter . - No . No . - Come on , John . - Give it to me . Give it . - Get off me . - Leave her alone . No one 's talking to you , weirdo . - Don 't . Stop . - Come on . - Hey . - Watch out , man . Give it to me , you screwy bitch . - John . John . - Take the damn lighter . Come on , John . Let 's get out of here . Come on . I 'm out here on Mulholland Drive , where a hiker has discovered what appears to be the body of a man who died over 60 years ago . Tom Jacobs was out for an early-morning walk when he spotted a piece of metal in the ravine . Tom ? Well , I saw what looked like the bumper of a car . But when I got closer I could see that it was one of those old-timey ones like you see in the movies . And then I saw the bones . Personal effects found in the vehicle reveal the remains to be those of Fred Jeffers a man who disappeared in the 1920s . Wait . What are you doing ? What do you- - ? What do you want ? No . Wait . Stop . No ! Aah ! " Jeffers ' disappearance was a terrible blow for Chandler who endured a string of tragedies starting with the death of his son , Will who died on New Year 's Eve , 1920 . " New Year 's Eve , 1920 . Let 's get him out of here . That 's Rupert Chandler 's boy . Let 's cover him up , let 's get him out of here . Come on . Will Chandler died in the speakeasy fire . And Myron Stark was there . So there must be a connection . I thought you were gonna kill that guy . - Why 'd you call me ? - Because I wanted you to come . Weird way of showing it . Oh , the flirting-with-Mike thing ? I 'm a teenage girl , John . We do that kind of crap to guys we like . The loner weirdo ? I don 't get it . I 've never gotten it . My old foster parents were these ' 60s hippies always talking like they were single-handedly saving the world because they recycled . They called me " the deviant . " Like , " The deviant got a C in math . " " Should we take the deviant to see Bruce Hornsby ? " That 's why I came up to you that day , John . Because I thought , since you 're a weirdo you might get me . My foster parents used to call me " the delinquent . " So you did take the lighter . I like shiny things . Bad habit . What happened to your real parents ? They died when I was little . In a fire . Why were you in a foster home ? You have your mom . She was in a mental hospital . Well , that explains things . She was engaged once . He was a pretty cool guy . It didn 't work out but he was kind of the only friend we had . A little while ago he , uh , helped us with something . There was an accident , and his new wife died . And he left . That 's what happens . I shouldn 't be around people . Is that why you went nuclear on Mike ? No , that 's ... . That 's other stuff . Do you want to talk about it ? Sometimes , yes . Mostly no . But sometimes yes . I found Will Chandler 's obituary . I 'm kind of peeing right now . Can 't it wait ? Four hundred people came to his funeral . - He had a lot of friends . - His father had a lot of money . - There 's a difference . - I think Stark killed him . We don 't even know if they knew each other . And if Stark wanted to kill Chandler , why take out 43 innocent people ? It happens . - Do you ever think about dying ? - About what ? - Or about suicide ? - Why would I think about that ? Because there 's something wrong with you . Gee , don 't ever look for work as a counselor . I 've never thought about killing myself . Not for a minute . It would destroy my mom , for one . I mean , I couldn 't do that to my family . To the people who love me . Could you ? Anyways , I 'm not sick anymore . I mean , I have to get a scan every six months but so far , I 'm clean . Earlier , when I cross-referenced the names of survivors from the fire this woman 's name came up in a documentary about the Roaring ' 20s . It might tell us more about what happened inside the speakeasy . Film vault 's on the top floor . You 'll have to go alone . - Why ? - No wheelchair access . Whoa . Whoa ! - You 're really strong . - I work out . Wow , look at all this . DVDs are all right , but this is the real deal . Silver nitrate . Raw . Before filmmakers figured out all the tricks . Pure humanity on film . None of that computer-generated digital crap they do today . All these people , captured , frozen in time . They never age . I mean , a hundred years can pass they 'll still be here , still look exactly the same . Would be nice , wouldn 't it ? Freeze yourself in a moment . The best moment of your life . Have things never change . Be beautiful , healthy , strong . Anyway , don 't let me get all A.E. Housman on you . Uh ... . The documentary 's up there . We would go out to the gin joints every weekend . We 'd drink and smoke and dance the black bottom and the Charleston , the shimmy . Ha-ha . I was a real bearcat back then . And I was crazy in love with this prizefighter . We were together there , the night when the fire started . He was helping everybody out . And I just remember sitting on the curb , crying . People said that someone threw a bomb in the door . Well , to tell you the truth , I was pretty zozzled . That 's what we called it then . But I didn 't see a bomb . Uh ... . What I did see was this , um , flash of blue light and sparks . Then the craziest thing . This man , in the middle of the room , naked as a jaybird . Well , I don 't know maybe I just imagined the whole thing , who knows ? Probably the liquor talking . The fire , it was an accident . Yeah , sounds like there was some electrical problem . He didn 't mean to kill all those people . No , of course not . It 's just like in The Wizard of Oz when the house falls on the witch . Give me your clothes . Hey , where are you going ? I know what he was looking at . He was measuring the star 's radial velocity the distance in parsecs , and the Cartesian coordinates . - What ? Why ? - To pinpoint the date . You can tell the date by looking at the sky ? Stellar motion can calculate what the sky will look like for hundreds of years in the future or the past . - Why is the date so important ? - It 's not . Unless it 's the wrong date . Myron Stark was in the wrong place at the wrong time . " If we cry because the sun has gone out of our lives our tears can prevent us from seeing the stars . " Chandler 's eulogy for his son ? " Today is a day for mourning , but it is also a day to remember my son , a gifted young man with a grand heart . A budding architect , his dream was to build Pico Tower on the corner of Third and Pico . That was his land , the soil where his dreams were to take root . It will remain his land forever , never to be sold or developed . Instead , his legacy will live on , in a memorial garden I will plant there in his honor . " That can 't be right . There is a Pico Tower in downtown L.A. It 's an architectural landmark . We took a field trip there in third grade . Someone must have built it . Tax records . They show Chandler 's rivalry with Stark cost him everything . His business went under in July 1925 . His assets were auctioned off to pay off his debt including the property at Third and Pico . Bankruptcy , tragic accidents , the death of a beloved son . It 's like the family 's cursed . - Mr . Chandler , I 'm Myron Stark . - Do I know you ? - No , you don 't know me . - Mr . Chandler 's in a hurry . I 'm interested in purchasing a piece of property . Third and Pico . - That land 's not for sale . - I 'll pay twice what it 's worth . Are you deaf ? He said it 's not for sale . Does it say who bought it ? The Pico property ? " M.S. " Stark ? So he not only bought the land , but he designed it himself ? - The building . It 's about the building . - What is ? Stark accidentally killed the man who was gonna build it . So he had to build it himself . Everything he did was to drive Chandler under and get him to sell that land . Okay . There must be a reason why Stark needed to build it . You wanna know the really weird thing ? Stark disappeared two weeks before the building opened ... - ... in May of 1927 . - Disappeared ? Fell off the face of the earth . - Never seen again . - What 's happened at Pico Tower since it was built ? Anything important ? - Anything on New Year 's Eve ? - New Year 's Eve when ? - Any New Year 's Eve . - Not that I can see . In fact , it 's closed now . They had to retrofit after the last earthquake . I 'm not sure when they 're reopening . Hey . Hey , I thought you left . What are you doing back here ? Are you all right ? - What happened ? - I 'm fine . - Your brother again ? - I 'm fine . You never touched your doughnuts . I wasn 't hungry . Your muscles are weak . It was difficult for you to pull the trigger . You 've lost 8 percent of your body weight in the past two weeks . When I carried you to the film vault , I weighed you . Wait . What ? This whole night , the entire time , you 've been examining me ? What the hell is going on here ? Your cancer 's back . You have a secondary tumor in the long bone of your arm and possibly your lungs . - Are you joking ? - No . Then you 're crazy . You don 't know what you 're talking about . Ewing 's sarcoma : First identified in the 1920s- - I know what it is , okay ? I 'm the one in here . No wonder you don 't have any friends . You can 't just do things like that . You can 't just show up whenever you need something . You can 't carry a gun and freak people out and walk in the bathroom when a guy 's taking a leak and ask him if he 's gonna kill himself . And you can 't just blurt things out like , " You have cancer . " Especially to someone who 's already had it . You have no clue , do you ? You have no idea what it 's like to have something inside of you . Something that 's damaged . It 's like a bomb waiting to go off . I need to finish my paper . You should make an appointment with your oncologist . - The tumor 's still small . - Get out . Where were you all night ? Out . Carbon chain C24 , lanolin and red dye number 27 . You were with Riley . We 're closed . Is Eric here ? Eric ? He works the night shift . He lets me in . I have no idea . They just called and asked me to come in . Sorry . Do you like doughnuts ? I have one glazed , one rainbow sprinkle , one cinnamon twist .

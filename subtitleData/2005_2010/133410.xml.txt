That we have more questions . I did , however , confirm it 's amphibious . Although , whether that holds for adults is still unclear . It 's range estimate has been extended as well . But we don 't know if it 's a part of a migratory pattern or through sheer propagation . We don 't know what happened to the Topeka . Does the uncertainty make you nervous , Davis ? Think beyond your work for a moment . Think as a human being . It 's a wonderful time to be alive . I envy you . Your enthusiasm . The men I work for are not like that . They 're addicted to facts .

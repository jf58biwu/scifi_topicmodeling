 Previously on Defying Gravity ... - Paula ! - Steven ! The container pinned her and the hatch door came down . She 's got no thumb ! I saw Mars , Eve . Does it do this ? - It 's trying to tell you something . - Has it happen to you ? Just me and one other person . It 's to late for second thoughts . I took the pill this morning . I need a doctor ! Get her into a bay . Stats and IV access now . Let 's move . - You had an emergency hyterectomy . - Abortion pill ? - You can 't tell anyone . - A burst cyst ? That 's what we 're saying . Understand ? I remember a schoolgirl in a bombed-out building during the war . Did you save her ? I was the one that called in the strike . If I was on that table , she wouldn 't give up on me . I found her thumb ! Whatever this was , it wasn 't pain medication . or withdraw from alcohol . This was ... a full-grown hallucination . .. : Defying Gravity : .. .. : Defying Gravity : .. .. : S01E07 - Fear : .. From all of us down here on terra firma , We 'd like to wish you folks a little near-the-spirit-world happy halloween . Hey , what happened , baby ? I thought you said you were gonna wear a mask . Very funny . Oh , Paula . We both dressed up as zombies . This is just embarrassing . Save your insults , Steven . I can already wiggle my thumb . Okay , yo , yo , yo . Careful with that . A lot of work went into that little digit , okay ? We do copy the movement , though , Paula . Well , nothing 's keeping me off Venus . One of the first things you learn in training doesn 't come from a manual . It 's instinctual- - Darwin-type stuff . Never show weakness . Surgeon , she 's looking pale . Do you have anything ? Yeah , a slightly elevated heart rate and temperature at the moment . Could be a response to the oxygen . Her hand 's infection-free and healing well . Keep me updated . It doesn 't matter that you 're frightened or hurt or having a bad day . No one cares what you 're going through . They only care if you can get the job done . Okay , folks , today 's the big day . so other than the task at hand , it 's light marching orders for everyone . How about we give a nice , big , friendly wave to our guests from the Comet Candy Company . Who are here to watch you make your commercial today . Yes , they 're very excited to see you trick-or-treat in space . I know I certainly am . Yeah , we 're all pretty excited . up here , as you can tell . Copy that . Okay , I 'm gonna turn things over to your director , David Selner . He 's gonna be calling the shots . Yeah , we all know Dave from training . Hey , man . You guys look great . Listen , we 're gonna keep it real simple . The most important thing is just have a good time . Copy that . It 'll be exactly what we rehearsed in training . You all step off the ship , move to your marks . Nadia , you unfurl the banner with the Canadarm . Then y 'all say , " trick or treat , " And we make broadcast history . Piece of cake . You heard him , folks . Piece of cake . It 's a busy day , so we 'll let you all get to work . - Well , this goes without saying , Paula . - I can do it . - You cannot . - You can 't . Jen will replace you on the EVA . And you can shoot a " Making Of " Video for your classroom . Okay ? Your thumb 's gonna thank you , Paula . Yeah . You don 't want to risk more damage for some stupid commercial . How much are they putting into the program anyway ? - I heard $ 10 Billion . - What ? $ 10 Billion to advertise a candy bar ? - It 's prostitution . - It 's tradition . Russians used commercials to pay for the " Mir " back in the ' 90s . Guys , get used to it . There 's gonna be eight more along the way . - Let 's go . - Ted , i can do this . Let 's go . Everyting is a-okay , all systems go , ready for liftoff . every astronaut knows the rules of the jungle . limping antelope don 't go into space . They stay on earth , where they 're killed and eaten . I 'm a freak . - You 're not a freak . - I 'm worse than a freak . I am a pathetic , recently spayed wannabe astronaut condemned to the barren existence of a space nun . They are looking at me . I Have seen that look before . That is the way you look at a dying pet . Those are looks of awe and amazement . They 're amazed i 'm eating my lunch ? They 're amazed you 're moving . I get my uterus out . And I am on the floor , in a ball , bowl of ice cream next to me . That was day two . I am better now . Should you even be here ? I 'm fine , okay ? In fact , I feel terrific . - You ought to be home in bed , though . - I heal quickly . - I 'm just saying . - Well , I 'm a-okay , Donner , yes . Please . Go . So does this mean that you 're going to go to the halloween shindig tonight ? They way I feel ? Not a chance . Well , I think I 'm gonna go ... either as a pirate wench or a vampire slut . Not sure , but , you know , either way it 's fishnets . Ted likes fishnets ? All men like fishnets . - It 's genetic . - Zoe ? I just wanted to say- - No , Ajay . You don 't say anything . Nothing . If you 're going to sit here , all you can do is eat . - Would you like half of my sandwich ? - Why ? Because I look weak ? Becaus I look like I need more food ? You 're a freak . Is there an increase in Gamma ? Nothing we can see . My temperature 's rising . I feel a pulse coming on . Open . Go , go , go ! Close . Ted Shaw . A pulse ? Do you mean like a heartbeat ? No , no . No . IT 's more like a wave . Builds to a peak and then ends . I 've only had it happen a few times . Are you feeling flushed or feverish ? - Yeah , a little . - Well , you may experience more intense hallucinations . - Like Mintz ? - Possibly . You know , he 's convinced that his med patches were psychotropic . And he should keep believing that . Is anyone else experiencing anything ? - Paula 's running a low-grade fever . - Her hand is healing . You know , Donner did hint at something about a week ago but hasn 't mentioned anything since . Well , he 's an astronaut . Astronauts aren 't the only ones that hold things back , Mrs. Shaw . I know , but I 'm telling you now , Ted , keep your eye on them and on yourself . Thanks . I 'll take him . Look who Mama 's talking to . - Daddy . - Hey , Roy boy . - Tell him why you 're here . - Watch him in the commercial . You know , when I wave from outer space who I 'm gonna be waving to ? - You . We 're gonna go trick-or-treating with some of the other kids . And have you decided who you 're gonna be ? Doctor Ra . - Doctor Ra . - I don 't want to go . Ugh . Some of the other kids have him freaked out with ghosts and graveyards and ... So you don 't want to trick-or-treating ? It 's dark . It 's really dark where Daddy 's gonna be trick-or-treating . But you know what I do when I 'm scared ? I think about all the candy I 'm gonna have when I 'm done . Trust me . It 's gonna be worth your while . Baby astronauts can 't be scared . So let me get this straight . Four of the most highy trained human beings ever are about to use their skills to step into the deep , unforgiving darkness of space , so that we can go trick-or-treating for $ 10 billion ? And if something goes wrong , we get to die on live TV . You know what ? I 'll tell you the truth . I don 't really care what the risks are . I 'll do pretty much anything if it means hours outside the ship . And I 'll freely admit it . I 'm an EVA whore . Yeah , whore . $ 10 billion buys a whole lot of science , by the way . Science ? Yeah , the ship admission dollars are already guaranteed before launch . These commercials pay for the gravy . Oh , wait a minute . Since when did the science become the gravy ? Yeah , isn 't that why we 're up here in the first place ? Oh , you mean in addition to the flag planting and the industrial exploration and the mining rights ? Let me ask you- - what 's the first thing to get cut during a budget squeeze ? - The science . - Yeah , the science . Trick or treat , ladies . Trick or treat . It 's my favorite holiday , i 'm on a spaceship , and it feels like ass . It 's the isolation . You 're missing other people . No , it 's the fact that I 'm stuck with a bunch of tight butts that won 't make the effort to wear a little costume . I mean , everybody up here is so afraid of looking stupid . Whatever happened to that spirit of Major Tom ? That 's what I want to know ? Major Tom 's is 35 million kilometres away . So ? We are astronauts living in a tin can hurtling trough a vacuum . Somehow getting dressed up like vampires or pirate wenches loses its appeal . Not to mention the fact that El DÃ­a De Los Muertos is a day to honor the dead . Not to pervert them . Do you guys ever get , like , really bad cramping when you keep your butt cheecks clenched together that tightly ? Okay . Selner wants us to use cameras ... 25 , 35 , ... 92 and 120 . Nadia , you want to move the arm so 92 can see it ? Who are you ? Who 's who ? Nadia ? Nadia ! - Maybe your days be peaceful ... - and filled filled with good health . It 's not a bad Doctor Ra . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Oh , you- - you 're missing the belt . You know , they said you were detail-oriented . Oh , really ? What else did they say ? That you were mysterious . And influential . And somebody said you were good-looking . You know , the exact opposite of anyone from ISO . They 're not that bad . Well , you 're only saying that because they employ you . Actually , I work for a subcontractor . And they said that you 're involved with , uh , training - and crew selection ? - Yeah , a little bit of everything , which is part of why I want to talk to you- - to get to know you a little better . Well , how about after work tomorrow for drinks ? How about now ? And I should warn you . It might get a little detail-oriented . It 's only gonna take a few minutes of your time . It 's about Mars . You sure you don 't want to come ? I have an extra pair of fishnets . Yeah , I 'm not up to being vampy . I 'm thinking hot bath and a bed . - You feeling allright ? - Yeah . Never better . And you are ? I 'm Greg Maddux . It 's , my namesake . He was a hall of fame pitcher back in the 1900s . Nice . Nice . Your father gave it to you in high school . You , uh , haul it out every year at halloween . Yeah , something like that . - What are you supposed to be ? - I 'm a baseball cheerleader . Baseball doesn 't have cheerleaders . She 's from Germany . I 'm a german baseball Cheerleader . In Fishnets ? Nice touch . I 'm sorry you won 't be coming , Zoe . You must be very weak . Such an ordeal . We all were talking about how awful you must feel . - Please get some rest . - Yeah . - Take it easy , okay ? - Thank you . I will . Good night . - Okay . - Bye . Okay , so now I wanna go trick-or-treating . - I don 't feel like trick-or-treating , Nadia . - I do . Hi . Give me 20 Minutes . I 'm coming . What 's the matter ? Nothing . It was nothing . Well , you just turned your head like you ... Yeah , I thought I heard someone come in . I was wrong . - Want me to zip you up ? - Sure . Thanks . Now see , that 's what I 'm talking about . Zoe just had a heart spike . I 'm getting them from Ted , Paula , Evram and Donner . They 're also running low-grade fevers . So am I. From all the way down here ? Eve ? Distance doesn 't seem to matter . So Beta is causing these hallucinations ? We 're not sure how many of them are actually hallucinating , but they 're experiencing something . elevated heart rates and body temperatures . - Like you 've experienced in the past ? - And I 'm experiencing now . Typically , Beta 's pulse will crescendo and then recede . And where are we in the symphony ? - Oh , it 's getting louder . - Why ? Why now ? What is it trying to do ? We 're about to broadcast live to millions of people around the world . I don 't think it 's a coincidence . What would it have to gain ? We 've been hiding it from the crew , from the world . I don 't know . Maybe it wants to be revealed . No . Not now . Not on its terms . Do we have an alternative ? Only one . We believe that this particular lot of libido inhibitors is contaminated . What we 're seeing indicates that , at the far end of the spectrum , There may be a chemical reaction that acts like a psychotropic . Hold on . Hang on . So your astronauts are on acid ? No , but there is the potential for disorientation and mild hallucinations . Awesome . The contaminate hasn 't been pinpointed just yet , But we 're analyzing it right now . In the meantime , I don 't think anyone wants to jeopardize the safety of our crew for a candy commercial . Nadia . Evram . I thought ... You scared me . Really ? You ? - Are you feel all right ? - I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Come back to the air lock with me . A contaminated batch of halos ? Seriously ? I mean , I feel great . All of us are running low-grade fevers except for Jen and Wass , And I 'm worried it might be psychotropic . You mean , like cause hallucinations ? It certainly explains what 's been happening to me . But we 're still gonna shoot the commercial ? I think they 're in a meeting . This is $ 10 billion scientific research we 're talking about . All we have to do is go out there on thethers and say " trick or treat " . An hour ago , you thought it was a complete waste of time . That 's before we realized what it funded . They pull back on the programs , nothing we do up here will get properly analyzed . Yeah , at least not in our lifetime . I mean , we don 't do this commercial , you can be damn sure they 're not gonna give us the money . You realize this is not just another candy commercial . This is an international event . We have purchased commercial airtime across the planet . We understand it would be a pretty high-profile scrub . And of course we would expect our expenses to be covered . That 's in excess of $ 1 billion US in addition to the $ 10 billion that you would no be getting from us for this mission . Let 's not get crazy . We can just reschedule this for the fly-by to Mars next year . Next year ? Who 's gonna give a rat 's ass about this mission next year ? It 'll be old news by then . Look , ... The money 's obviously substantial , Mike . We 'd need to make cuts to certain programs . The science . But if we 're talking about potential problems and not actual problems , Why don 't we put it to the crew , See how they feel ? I feel fine . I 'm perfect , and I 'm certainly not hallucinating . I 'm not about to lose those science dollars . Good to go . Not quite sure what you guys are talking about , but happy to take the HALO off , if that 's gonna do it . That 's two of us . Listen , I , um , promised my son I would wave to him from outer space , and that 's what I intend to do . From where I 'm standing , everyone is medically sound and unimpeded , as am I. Astronauts . I guess we 're ready to go . - Let 's get on with it then . - Yes , Sir . Antares , you 're good to go . Copy that . - Hi , Mommy . - Hi , Baby . - Time for Doctor Ra ? - Yes , it 's time for Doctor Ra . Hope you 're ready . Rollie said that Ted is going as Doctor Ra . So i fgured i would show up as Medic Zu . What are you going as anyway ? Something I will never be . Oh , no . No , no , no . Oh , my god . Yeah , pregnant astronaut , folks . That 's right . You can stop your puppy dog stares , because I 'm back , and I 'm , uh , laughing at it with ya . Classic case of overcompensation . She 's probably on all sorts of meds . I hope she 's smart enough to not drink . I need a drink . This is a disaster waiting to happen . All right , Nadia , are you and wass ready on the arm and cameras ? Roger that . We are ... good to go . Ted ? You guys all set ? Roger . Just waiting on the trick-or-treat buckets . All right . I 'm gonna turn you over to David in a minute . We are 12 minutes and counting to air . Copy . By the time you guys see this , you probably would have seen the Comet Candy commercial about a hundred times , but this is a behind-the-scenes look at how we did it . The astronauts are just about ready to enter the air lock That is their pathway ... to space . The air lock is where we depressurize the atmosphere , Uh , to that of ... Until it 's the same as ... outer space . And then we can , uh ... open the outer air lock door and we can ... Hector ? Hector ? Paula ! Paula ! - Ted , you okay ? - I 'm fine . All nominal . I 'm sweating like crazy . I think we ought to be doling a deodorant commercial . Ajay , any way you can pump some more A.C. intohese suits ? Yeah . Let me see what we can do . Ted 's heart rate is near 130 . Zoe and Donner- - 120 plus . Which one 's Daddy ? The big astronaut , babe . Come on . Let 's go to mommy 's sation . I 'll give you a headset , and you can listen in . - Are they all right ? - Yeah . Okay , folks , we 're at T minus ten until airtime . Opening the media feeds now . Hector ? Paula , where are you going ? Hector ? Help me ! - Paula . - Oh , it 's okay . He 's dying . Oh , my god . - Who 's dying ? - It 's okay . - It 's okay . - Paula , who 's dying ? It 's my dog Hector . He 's dying . - Paula , Hector 's not here . - It 's okay , boy . - Help me , please . He 's dying . - Paula , he 's a hallucination . All right ? - You 're doing it again . - What ? That thing that you just did- - it 's like you 're hearing something . What are you hearing ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Hey , you guys , do you mind if we save the small talk until after we get this done ? Did I tell you my boy is watching ? Roy 's down in Mission Control . I 'm gonna wave to him . Well , all right , let 's do this for Roy . And $ 10 billion . - Science forever . - And forever science . - Flight , depressurizing air lock . - Copy that , Antares . - Outer hatch opening . - You 're good to go . Mag grav coming off . And .. mag grav off . Copy . All right , guys . Let 's do this . Ted ? Ted , is there a problem ? I understand you not wanting to talk about the mission . Probably pretty painful . But we 're going back there , and I want experienced astronauts on this crew . There 's not much I can say that you can 't read about . I want to hear it firsthand from you . Right . The detail lady . God is in the details . Look , I don 't know if you 've ever felt responsible ... for losing anyone . I have . Same as you . And it haunts me all the time . tell me about the storm . Donner and I were packing up the hab . - It was the last sol on the mission . - Sharon and Walker ? Sharon and Walker were about 5 Kilometres out , in the rover , picking up experiments , some last minute stuff . The rover broke down in the dust , so they had to cover that by foot . And then the storm just ... Did it take you by surprise ? We were expecting it , but ... We just didn 't know how bad . You try to plan pretty well for everything , You know , have alle the contingencies covered , do everything that is humanly possible so you won 't fail , ... fail your crewmates , fail the mission and ... It just all happened so fast . One , two , three . I 'm not paying for these . That 's gotta be , like , her sixth shooter . Will you please stop worrying about Zoe Barnes ? She 's a big girl , Donner . She can take care of herself . I can 't believe this . How can he not just pick up and say , " I 'm busy " ? He 's probably too busy . You know what ? I 'm not even asking for an explanation . I just want a little common courtesy , because I am telling you , putting together Medic Zu at the last minute is not easy . Please . I 'll bet you had the wig and the top in your closet already . I know the stockings were . - Hey , I am looking for a sympathetic ear here . - Not getting one from me . - Come on . Let 's dance . - No , no , no . Last thing you want to do is dance . The last thing i want to do is look like , the last thing i want to do is dance , you get it ? I get it . You want to dance ? A pregnant astronaut drinking . I like it . - To the baby . - To the baby . So ... Doc Ra a no-show ? Never trust a Vortan . Right . Can you tell me what the hell 's going on ? Uh , Ted , we got six minutes to get you people into place . We were just wondering what the hang-up is . Ted , you gonna do this ? We need you guys out of the air lock . Ted , you copy ? - Surgeon ? - His blood pressure 's off-the-chart . You 're not doing too well either . No one is . - Mintz ? - Evram , are you near the air lock ? Uh , no . Uh , in the truss corridor with Paula . The hallucinations , um , we can 't move . Copy that . Don 't try . In five minutes we go live to the world , people . Five minutes . I need to see them in their places . - What 's wrong with Daddy ? - Nothing , honey . Daddy 's fine . He looks scared . Hey , buddy . I know , you 're going through something there , but , uh , where you at ? Talk to me . Come on , Ted . Look at us . Continue the launch sequence now . - Ted , we can 't leave them here . - You 're damn right we can 't . Sharon ? Walker ? Come on . Push . You and Donner thought they were close enough . You thought they had a chance . They were less than 100 metres away . That 's less than a football field . And Goss ordered you to launch . You know , we all have moments we regret . But you don 't need to feel guilty . My clearance allows complete access to the archives . I 've gone through the cockpit tapes , the telemetrics , The readings from Sharon and Walker 's suits . I 'm the detail lady , Ted . And I 'm here to tell you definitively , they were not gonna make it . Nadia , excuse me . You know , it 's gonna be a lot less festive tomorrow morning . I 'm having fun , Donner . FOAD . - FOAD ? - ( fuck off and die ) . - I though you didn 't swear . - Oh , I swear . I swear . Ich thought you didn 't date astronauts . - Tequila , Tommy . - No , Tommy , belay that . Two large waters . I told you to foad . Look , I 'm just here with Nadia because we had a ... I don 't care , Donner . You do whatever you like with your rules . Well , you watch your sixes with vapor trails over there , okay ? I know he may seem really charming , ... but he 's kind of a legend for scamming on pretty , drunk ASCANs , - And you 're pretty drunk . - Watch my sixes ? What ? You 're my wingman now ? You 're looking out for me ? Let me tell you somethin ' , Mr. Hotshot - been-to-Mars , tragic american hero . I don 't need a wingman . I can look after myself . Okay ? - I belong in this program . - Yeah , I know you do . I told you that . - I have sacrificed for this program . - I got that . Really ? Do you have that , Donner ? Mr. I have rules ? ' Cause I don 't think you have a clue . I don 't think ... You know what ? You never will . You will never know ... What I gave up for this program . This is all yours now . You 're kind of making a little bit of a scene here . Tequila , Tommy ! Hey , maybe we should go out and grab a bite , get some air . No . - You know ... - Take her home . You expect everyone , me especially ... - All right . Come on . - I got here . You stay here . Donner , get out . I 'm always sick around you . Our relationship is built on vomit . I think I should be the one to help them get home . Zoe . Zoe , come on . We gotta get going here . Do you copy ? What the hell is going on with all of you ? Ted , look at me . We can do this , Donner . It 's now or never . We have to go . Donner , we need to focus here . Two minutes to air , people . Two minutes . It 's time to go , Donner . Where 's my canadarm ? Nadia , I need to see the banner . - Ted ? - Nadia . She 's not doing so good , David . She says she keeps seeing someone in the hatchway . Come on , Ted . Look at us . Please , Ted . Come on . We can 't lose those funds . Do it for Roy . Do it for science . But please , copy . $ 10 billion , Ted . Come on . Do you copy ? - Somebody 's gotta call it . - We can do this , Donner . No . No , Sharon . Please . Please . We can do this , Donner . No . We can 't . Flight , we 're aborting . You copy ? Copy that , Donner . We are aborting . Get everyone back on the ship . Unbelievable . $ 10 billion . That 's gonna take a real bite . We might as well just abandon the science altogether . I 'm sorry , guys . I 'm sorry if I let you down . My son probably saw everything , right ? It wasn 't just you , Ted . It was all of us . Is anybody still hallucinating ? - I 'm okay . - I am a litte bit , but it 's fine . - I 'm good to go here . - So am I. This is one screwed-up halloween . I trust you are as ambarrassed as I am disappointed . I won 't belabor the point . Expect to hear from our attorneys . The only embarrassment I suffered , was watching astronauts carry candy buckets into space . As to the rest , my man made the right call . I hope you feel that way in the morning . Count on it . Hey , maybe next time , fellas . Mahalo , Mike . Much aloha . Is it over ? Their vitals are starting to normalize . It 's over , but nothing 's to say it won 't happen again . So , Roy , is your mom gonna take you trick-or-treating ? Daddy didn 't . There 's a reason no one likes to show fear . It 's taken as a sign of weakness . A festering wound . Being vulnerable leads to being dinner in a darwinian world . It 's okay . We 'll finish . But there 's also the risk of hubris , of not knowing your own limits ... And that may be the biggest danger of all . What I wanted to say today in the cafeteria wasn 't about sandwiches . What I meant to say was , ... That you made the right decision . So you must never look back or feel regret ... because your path is in space . You know that . Your soul was meant to soar . Even I know that . Your baby 's sould ... It was meant to move on To another body , another path . Independent of you , but not forgotten . So you must not feel guilt , ... because , you see , there is freedom for both of you . That must bring you some joy . How is he ? He 's confused , a little shaken up . Scared . A weakness he learned from his father . His father is the most brave man I know . - Is he going trick-or-treating ? - No , not with the others . As I was saying . - But I think ... he will come out all right in the end . - Trick or treat . There 's a fine line between bravery and stupiditiy . Thank you . And if you really want that bag of candy ... sometimes it makes more sense to show a little weakness , ask for help . Donner ? Thanks for today . One of us could have been killed . I guess . I may not be expressing it , but I am really glad you 're up here . Likewise . I mean that . If I tell you something , will you promise not to make fun of me or think that I 'm crazy ? I mean it . This is ... This is between you and me . Yeah , sure . I 've been having this dream , and I don 't know why , but it really scares me . In the dream I am , um ... - I 'm pregnant . - You 're pregnant ? Yeah , I 'm pregnant up here , and floating , naked through here , into the air lock . I look out the pane , and I see ... You see me , and I 'm outside . I 'm working on a thruster and there 's a really bright light emerging from behind a planet . Yeah . Okay . I 've been having that same dream , for , like , two months . What happened , today , these hallucinations , the dream ... This has nothing to do with thes HALOs , does it ? No .

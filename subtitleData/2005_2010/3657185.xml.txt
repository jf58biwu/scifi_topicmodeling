 I think I found someone to fill Joseph 's shoes . - How do I look ? - Like everybody else . - I 've never met you before . - You pulled me from the 424 bus after it crashed at Lexington and 53rd . What made you become a paramedic ? I wanted to save lives instead of watching them pass . You 're exactly who I 'd hoped you 'd be . Hi , I need a file . Who are you listening to ? I 'm talking to myself . Seriously , what are you ? A vampire ? An alien ? Some kind of freakish government experiment ? I saw this girl on YouTube . { \ pos ( 192,260 ) } She was born with this gene that doesn 't let her feel any pain . I didn 't tell her , she just found out . She 's not the enemy . She 's just a girl , the only friend that I 've made . This is my mess , and I 'm gonna clean it up . I 'm tired of keeping this secret to myself . Do you wanna be my roommate ? To closure . To closure . Have a little too much to drink ? On the ground ! Hands behind your head . Down ! Now ! Mind your backs . Watch your back , Lydia . Mrs. Comey 's unparalleled blueberry waffles . This is my favorite part of the day . It 's full of possibility . Before the inevitable monkey wrenches come looking for us . But more than anything ... it 's about being with all of you . I know grace is a supper thing , but every morning I thank heaven and earth for our family . Sadly , Joseph 's death has left us an empty seat , a broken circle , but I feel like we 're on the way to mend it . There are lost lambs out there . They 're like us , but they 're hiding . Alone . Pretending to be that which they are not . It 's sad , pathetic . These people , they desperately need what we have . Understanding , unconditional love , family , trust ... who are we to deny anyone that ? Today 's an important day for us ... our family . And for one of them too . Because by day 's end , we will have a full table again . Eat . Okay , I gotta ask , what 's with the ear-to-ear , smiley ? This ... this is cool . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } - Drinking chocolate milk ? - No . Me . In college . In a dining hall with my new college roommate . No snipers shooting at me , no serial killers hunting me ... it 's a refreshing change of pace . Yeah , tedium can be such a thrill . I have been chasing normal life forever , and I 've finally caught it . I mean , don 't get me wrong , the chocolate milk is awesome . But right here , right now ... is full of possibilities . I can be anyone . Claire Bennet . You can 't escape your destiny . I am Becky Taylor . Psi Alpha Rush Chair . Your mom , Sandra 's sorority . Your mom was in a sorority ? She totally was . - Hi , Becky . - Hi . National has you on a list of legacies , but we haven 't heard from you about rush . Oh , I 'm not really sure I 'm a sorority girl . Neither was I at first . { \ So listen , } Open rush starts today at the house . Why don 't you come by . { \ and meet the girls } - No strings . Why not ? - She 's gonna have to pass . Well , great . I 'll see you there . Thanks . Isn 't this what we 've been talking about possibilities ? { \ I mean , } I think my mom is still friends with her sorority sisters . { \ Sororities are } It 's just a social crutch for people who can 't make their own friends . She said " no strings attached . " What 's the harm ? The harm is they get you alone and replace you with Stepford-Claire . Well , OK , how about I don 't go alone ? Yeah ! No . No , no way . Please ? Pretty please ? I 'll be your best friend . I 'll throw in a chocolate milk . What would Stepford-Gretchen wear to one of these things ? Captain Lubbock ? I 'm Dr Gibson . Madeline . Where 's Doctor Verheiden ? Retired . You 're new ? I 've been interning with Dr. Verheiden at A.U. for three years . Specializing in psychopathy , malignant narcissism disorder ... How many actual real-life criminal psych consults have you done ? Including this one ? So , who is he ? We have no idea . And neither does he . Found him last night covered in dirt , blood . Bullet holes in his jacket . The guy doesn 't know his name , what day it is , nothing . - Amnesia can be very complicated . - Let me simplify it for you { \ , Madeline } . Take out your rubber stamp and mark this guy " insane . " They don 't give us stamps . I 'm gonna need to talk to him . My name 's Dr Gibson . I 'm here to help you . Can you tell me your name ? - I ... - There 's been a lot of that . Starts and stops . Mostly stops . What are you thinking ? - Could be an aphasia . - Could be a what ? Any trauma to the head could result in brain damage . He was like this when we found him . Can you tell me what happened to you ? It was ... I was ... in ... the forest . Lost . And then I was ... Take your time . Walking ... { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } and now I 'm here ... { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } in this room . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } In this tiny room { \ , and I } ... I ... { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Captain , can you do me a favor and unlock these cuffs ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } I don 't make a habit of locking myself in with unrestrained lunatics . Then can you leave me your keys on the way out ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Let 's clean you up . Get you some clothes . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Maybe something to drink . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } I 'm gonna help you as best I can . Help you figure out who you are . Put the pieces together . Promise . Emma . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } I wanted to talk to you about yesterday . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Are you still seeing things ... the colors ? I was thinking more about it . I have another theory ... Conversion disorder . They used to call it ... I think this whole filing girl act is finally getting to you . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Only the ones who happen to be my daughter . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I think this whole focusing on work thing is getting to me . { \ pos ( 280,230 ) } I 've been told by more than one person { \ pos ( 280,230 ) } that I 've closed myself off from human connection . Here , Mom . Careful , it 's hot . So this is me trying to connect again . Starting with you , my family . I have to bother to show up at least . You did call Nathan , right ? Yeah , a couple times , mom . { \ pos ( 190,260 ) } - So I 'm thinking if ... - You didn 't just talk to the aide ? { \ pos ( 210,260 ) } That Elizabeth woman is a phone message black hole . Can we just focus on me , for a second , mom ? Yes , you hide in here . You 're filing things , it 's the waste of a brilliant mind . Be serious . { \ pos ( 170,210 ) } { \ * So } I thought being a paramedic , saving the most people possible ... That would fill that hole , but I ... Mom ? Yes . Yes , you 're right . Nathan will be fine . Let 's just , um ... Go on with what you were saying . Start over . I 'm not starting over . I thought you said it was important . I ran into Chief Kaufman . And he said that you could restart your residency if you want . He always thought you 'd make a wonderful doctor . It 's been six years . It 's time to stop blaming yourself for Christopher 's death . You have to stop grieving and take your life back , Emma . I 'm not grieving , I 'm ... Emma . I 've got to go . Got to get to work . - I think I 'll stay for a while . - Okay . Maybe Nathan 's just running late . It 's good seeing you . - Yes ? - You work too much . - You know that . - I do . Bye . And since 1924 it has been our charge to populate this house ... We 're late . With girls of the utmost quality and integrity . This is of course where you all come in . We can 't wait to get to know each and every one of you . Which brings us to my absolute favorite part of rush ... G-t-k-p-p-s-d . Get-to-know-perspective-pledges speed dating . Yay ! Okay . All the girls on my right to the chairs on the right . And all the girls on my left to the left . - Should we make a break for it ? - This is what normal girls do , right ? Really ? Scariest thing ever happened to me ? Does this count ? My mom raises professional show dogs ... show dog . No boyfriend to speak of . My dad works in paper . Government paper . I mean , it 's more like a series of ... no boyfriends . Hobbies ? Um ... - You used to be a cheerleader , right ? - How 'd you know ? Gretchen told me . Really ? { \ * Did she now ? } So you and Gretchen both lived in Texas ? Last round , ladies ! Make it count ! So Claire , I feel like I know you already . Let me guess , Gretchen ? She 's really cool . She 's very ... edgy . Yeah . I mean , you almost ... Are you all right ? { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Wait up a second . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Wait , wait . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Are you OK ? You almost got hit by a ... I mean that was ... you almost got hit . You 're welcome . Come on ! Hand me that , will you ? Who is it ? The new family member ? Why are you so interested ? You used my body to find them . I am understandably vested . Is it Petrelli ? Nakamura ? The Strauss woman ? The college co-ed ? - Claire Bennet . - Is it her ? You don 't know , do you ? I do not . But I felt something . In my bones , in the earth . But the dust hasn 't settled yet . It 's a gamble . Making promises and proclamations to all of us , based on a feeling . I understand the risks . But the rewards of growing our family are worth it . We 've got lots of cousins out there . Plenty of candidates . Many seeds planted . But who will break ground first ? I guess we 'll just have to wait and see . Have you seen my white sweater , it 's frilly and ... looks kind of exactly like that . Can I borrow this ? No ... yeah . Go ahead . Are you sure , cause that " go ahead " sounded a little bit annoyed ? - And I can just take it off . - No , don 't be silly . It looks good on you . Cool . Thanks . So I 'm just gonna use the restroom and then we gotta go . Yeah , we 're heading back that way now . Ready ? - Is everything OK ? - Yeah . Why don 't you go on without me and I 'll catch up ? No , I can just wait . No , don 't worry about it . I mean , it 's a mixer , right ? Feel like we should be mixing with people we don 't know . I know you already . You know ? Right . Oh . Mix master me . Okay . I 'll see you . It 's amazing . What is this ? Tea . You never had tea before ? I 've never had anything . It all feels ... it feels so new . Like I 'm feeling everything for the first time . Hot . And this ... is cold . It 's like ... I know these things , these words , these feelings . But they 're ... I can 't put them together . They 're not ... in my head they 're there . { \ * And then they 're not . } They 're gone . And it 's ... Scary ? It 's very scary . But also ... somehow beautiful . All of it is ... overwhelmingly beautiful . " Jamais vu . " It 's the opposite of " deja vu " , it 's quite common in cases of seizures and disassociate amnesia . That 's good news . How is that good news ? I think something traumatic happened to you and you 've blocked it out . It means that the " you " in you is still in there . Somewhere . I 'd like to try a memory exercise . I want you to close your eyes and tell me the first thing you see . Nothing , it 's just black . Just relax and be yourself . The ticking is distracting . What do you mean ? That clock and your watch { \ * are } ... they 're off . Somehow the different ticks , different timing . One is faster , much faster . This watch has been running fast for years . I keep meaning to fix it . But wha ... You heard that ? So , this ticking thing ... It 's good . It 's your subconscious . It 's probably a clue to your past . Let 's ... let 's try again . Can I see you in the hall , doc ? I 'll just be a sec . Okay ? AFIS just kicked back a fingerprint match . We got an ID . Colors . You saw them too ? You can 't ... You 're deaf . So you read lips ? All right , I must 've gotten your ability on the street . Ability ? This is new to you ? There are people like us who have abilities . They can fly , and teleport , and read minds . Sometimes I misunderstand . So can you ... ? That 's crazy . Is it ? Pretty amazing , huh ? Why me ? Why now ? That I don 't know . Maybe we could get lunch tomorrow . Figure it out . { \ * Get you } Out of the file room . I 'm fine with the file room . - No , I didn 't mean ... - It 's fine . I 'm so glad you came back . I was worried you 'd get cold feet . My feet are actually very toasty in here . It was nice to meet the girls . Good to expand my social Venn diagram ... into more circles . Then why stop now , right ? Kara ! Claire Bennet , Kara Hayback . I think we met at the G-P-P . Did you know { \ * that } you 're both ex-cheerleaders ? - You too ? - I had spirit , yes I did . What made you quit ? Sounds stupid , but I kind of hated the cheerleading part of cheerleading . { \ * That does } Not { \ * sound } stupid at all . I liked the bus rides and the bake sales , and I rocked a mean poster . - But football 's kind of ... - Pointless and boring . - Exactly . - Is that why you got out { \ * of the business } ? No , I just ... Watch out ! Hands on the table , palms down . - Where 's Dr. Gibson ? - I sent her home . What , no . She ... She was here . { \ * she said that } She { \ * ' d } came here to ... She was here to tell us who you are . But now we know that { \ * , Gabriel } . You 're a watchmaker from Queens who murdered your own mother . - { \ * Did } You said watchmaker ? - I also said " murder " and " mother . " Now hands on the table . I didn 't do anything wrong . I wouldn 't kill my mother . I would never ... What are you doing ? I 'm gonna use this interrogation room for interrogation . I 'm gonna get a confession from you - about how you killed your mother . - No , I didn 't kill anybody . And then they 're gonna throw you down a hole forever . - What are you doing ? - You said you 'd help me . You promised . You promised . You said you 'd help me . You promised . I didn 't do it . I didn 't say you did . But you 're thinking it . { \ , weren 't you ? } { \ Gretchen , } You were the only one there . - Why would I do something like that ? - Because I was making new friends , { \ maybe because } or you wanted to expose my freakiness to everyone . Do you actually realize how ridiculous that sounds ? I saw what you 've been looking at on your computer , the stuff about me . What were you doing snooping on my computer ? I wasn 't snooping . A book fell , the computer turned on , and I saw it . A book jumped off my shelf and begged you to invade my privacy ? Yes , it did ! So I googled you . So what 's the big deal ? I saw the stuff about Annie too . Can you honestly tell me you had nothing to do with it ? That stuff that happened to you really messed you up . - You 're a crazy kind of paranoid . - Paranoid ? No , paranoid is ... this is a pattern . The Annie thing , the accident tonight , the computer ... The speed dating ? I mean , talk about me much ? I get nervous talking about myself . You 're just more interesting . All I wanted was a normal life . And I trusted you ! I didn 't kill Annie . And I 'm not stalking you . OK , I 'm a little bit stalking you . But it 's not ... what you think . It 's just ... I have a crush . I 'm crushing ... on you . Say something . Claire Bennet . Gretchen Berg . Please accept this bid to join the Psi Alpha Chi sisterhood . It 's getting a little late for Hail Mary passes . Says you . Nothing . Nothing . Hello , Rebecca . I 'm missing " Bid night , " Uncle Samuel . I 'm sure they can carry on without you one night . I wanted to check on your work with Claire . Well , we 're sisters now . So , there 's that . You 're doing everything you can to isolate her ? Push other people away , push her in our direction ? Honestly ? I feel like all I do is push . What made you quit ? Sounds stupid , but I kind of hated the cheerleading part of cheerleading . That does not sound stupid { \ at all } . I like the bus rides and the bake sales , and I rocked a mean poster , but football 's kind of ... Pointless and boring . Exactly . Is that why you got out of the business ? No , I just ... Watch out ! I didn 't see you leave the party . I guess you 're still there . And you left the windows open . I don 't suppose she 's on her way here to us now ? It isn 't her , not yet . But I think your dust has finally settled . Get back to campus , Rebecca . Looks like we 're pulling up stakes . - I 'm not a killer . - You 're a kidnapper and a carjacker , and you beat up an entire city precinct somehow . He was gonna throw me in a hole . Hurt me ... Nobody believes me except for you . I don 't even know you { \ * , Gabriel } . That isn 't my name . I close my eyes , but it doesn 't feel like me . It 's not me . It sounds an awful lot like you . - A watchmaker ? - I know . Your watch , I heard the ticking , but it can 't be . I know I 'm not a killer . You know that . You 're right . What are you doing ? If you 're not a killer , { \ * then } by definition you won 't kill me . Take my car wherever you need to . - { \ * I need you . } I need your help . - You don 't even know me . - I don 't even know myself . - Turn yourself in . { \ * Let the police } They 'll figure out { \ * what happened to } about your mother . { \ * Let me } I 'll figure out { \ * what happened to } about you . I wanna see your hands . Now ! Do what he says . He 's turning himself in . Put the guns down , please . Please put the guns down . What { \ * the hell } was that ? I don 't know . Go . Run ! Run ! So much for human connection . It 's okay , brother . You 're safe here . Where exactly is here ? Home .

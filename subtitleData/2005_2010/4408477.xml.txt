 Where does it come from ? This quest , this need to solve life 's mysteries , when the simplest of questions can never be answered ? Why are we here ? What is the soul ? Why do we dream ? Perhaps we 'd be better off not looking at all . Not delving , not yearning . That 's not human nature . Not the human heart . That is not why we are here . How 's he doing ? - I 'm sorry . Did I scare you ? - No . No , I just ... I keep having these amazing dreams every time I close my eyes and never mind . He likes me to read him the stock page . Has he been conscious at all ? No . Been a week now . I think he 's close . A couple more days , maybe . You know I don 't know what he 'd do without you . - You got a real gift . - Just doing my job . No , you 're like a son to him . No , that would make us like brother and sister . Might be ... might be a little awkward if I ever wanted to ask you out . I 'm sorry , that was ... That was inappropriate . No , it 's sweet , it 's ... I 'm dating somebody . Yeah . No , really , it 's OK . I need to change his IV . I 'm sorry , of course . Man is a narcissistic species by nature . We have colonized the four corners of our tiny planet . But we are not the pinnacle of so-called evolution . That honor belongs to the lowly cockroach . They say that man uses only a tenth of his brain power . Another percent and we might actually be worthy of God 's image . Unless , of course , that day has already arrived . The Human Genome Project has discovered that tiny variations in man 's genetic code are taking place at increasingly rapid rates . Teleportation , levitation , tissue regeneration . Is this outside the realm of possibility ? Or is man entering a new gateway to evolution ? Is he finally standing at the threshold to true human potential ? I 'm sorry . I 'm out of time . I know , I know , I 'm beginning to sound like my father . I can 't help it . You know , they can fire me too , if they like , but there is something to it , Nirad . As crazy as it sounds . What is it ? It 's your father . He 's dead . How ? Driving a taxi in New York City is a very dangerous job . The wrong fare , the wrong time . We may never know what really happened . No , I spoke to him two days ago . He was convinced someone was following him , trying to steal his research . He died because of his theories . - That 's crazy . - Is it ? The man left his family , discredited his career , to chase wild theories halfway around the world . Where are you going ? To his apartment , to get his papers , his research . He was this close to finding the first of them . His Patient Zero , he tracked him to Queens , New York . Mohinder , listen to me . Your father was my colleague and my friend . A respected professor , a brilliant geneticist . But he had clearly lost touch with reality . I 've followed in his footsteps . My thesis is based on his research . Yes , you always wanted his approval . And now you 're telling me that it was all for nothing . I 'm telling you to let go . I need to know why he died . I need to know that it wasn 't all for nothing . And then I need to finish what he started . Hello ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm at his place now . No , no , no , he left everything behind but his computer . Research , the map . Yeah , let 's get a team in here to bag and tag everything . I gotta call you right back . Pervert ! Time to get up , Micah . Micah . Micah ! Micah . Micah . What ? Damn it , Micah , don 't do that to me . Do what ? Just you need to be careful . All right ? And I don 't want you talking to any strangers , do you understand ? I 'm just working on my computer . The logic board was bad , so I had to build a new one . A new one ... Did anyone ever tell you you 're the smartest little man on the planet ? You do . All the time . What 's this ? It 's a pinhole camera . It 's for the eclipse . The moon 's gonna cover up the sun today . We 're supposed to look at it at school . Speaking of which , you need to go get ready . Can 't be late . Not today . Mom , I 'm already dressed and I 've packed my own lunch . That 's what I 've been doing this morning . What about you ? Hey , don 't get smart with me . All right , I 've been working to pay our bills . Yeah , that 's why they turned off our gas again ? Go grab your stuff and wait by the back door , OK ? - Why ? - Just do it . Mom , what 's going on ? Never mind , just keep your voice down and stay close to me . Camera ready ? Yeah , almost ! Hold on . This looks like 70 , 80 feet . This is so unreal . OK , I 'm good ! OK . Oh my ... Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Claire ? Oh , my God . Claire ! This is Claire Bennet and that was attempt number six . You get out here , yes ? Yes , sorry . Thanks . Mr. Linderman , I 'm gonna have to call you back in five minutes , OK ? Thank you . I 'm late . I 've got a fundraiser and a drinks meeting . What is it ? It happened two more times . Sometimes I 'm falling , sometimes I 'm flying . - Sometimes you 're in ' em . - I don 't have time for this now . They 're not just dreams , Nathan . Hold this . I thought they 'd go away , but they 're not . Jim , I need this back by 6 : 00 , please . Thanks . This morning when I got out of bed , my foot hovered before it hit the ground . Hovered . For a split second , like I was ... like I was floating . I 'm telling you , I think I can fly . - These all are " Undecideds " ? - Mmm-hmm . Tell you what , you think you can fly ? Why don 't you jump off the Brooklyn Bridge ? See what happens . Maybe I ought to start with something a little lower first . - Just like learning to walk . - You 're serious . Oh , I 'm serious . You need to snap out of it , Peter . Go see a doctor , get some drugs . But do not pull a Roger Clinton on me man , I 'm eight points down in the polls . Look , this isn 't about you , all right ? Look , something is happening to me , and I have this feeling that you 're the only person that 's gonna understand this . Why the hell would I understand that you think you can fly ? Because you 're my brother ! Mom , look , I can 't talk right now . I 've got ... What ? I 'll be there in 10 minutes . What 'd she do now ? - She got arrested . - Arrested for what ? Shoplifting . I 'm so depressed . What ? What are you talking about ? Why ? I mean , I mean , besides the fact that it was so gross that I almost fudged myself , this is the single coolest thing to happen to this town in like , 100 years . Not if nobody finds out , it 's not . Why 'd you want me to tape it ? I have my reasons . I still can 't believe you asked me . You stopped talking to me in like , 6th grade . It 's safer this way . Why ? ' Cause I 'm not popular , so no one would believe me even if I did tell ? Which I won 't . Something like that . It 's not like you 're not gonna be popular anymore . Popular ? Who said anything about being popular ? My life as I know it is over , OK ? I 've got the Bishop game next week , SAT 's in October , homecoming 's three weeks from today , and I 'm a freak show . You 're being a little dramatic , don 't you think ? No , I don 't think . I have busted , like , every bone in my body , stabbed myself in the chest , I 've shoved a two-foot steel rod through my neck , and I don 't have a scratch on me . What do you call that thing sticking out ? Great . - Just give me the tape , OK ? - Sure . I can give you a ride on my handlebars if you want . That 's OK , I 'll walk . Look , thanks , OK ? I 'll talk to you in front of people at school tomorrow . Promise . - What do we have ? - Three clear . - Give me a count . - All clear . How the hell did they know we were coming ? Railroad schedules from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission . Routes for transporting nuclear material . Right . Not much else . Couple of notes here , mostly Arabic . Except for this . " Odessa . " What the hell is this , a name ? Oh , it 's a town in Texas . Odessa . What 's that ? You asked me what Odessa is . It 's a town in Texas . And a city in Russia , I think . What are you talking about ? What do you think ? CIA or FBI ? No , she 's dressed too nice for FBI . Saw the test scores got posted this morning . Don 't worry about it , man . Not everybody 's a test-taker . Who wants to be on SWAT anyway ? Too dangerous . You all right , man ? What 're you doing here , son ? You 're not authorized to be in here . Wait a minute . Shh ! Don 't shoot . Don 't ... Don 't shoot ! Now , the train is registered to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission . And there has been no official statement , yet , as to what was in the car . But judging by the amount of security around here , it 's pretty clear it was something very valuable . Reporting live from Odessa , Texas , I 'm Laura Lancaster . I want a lawyer . You lead me to the rest of your cell , I 'll think about it . Until then , no one knows you 're here , which means no one will know if you 're not . You found him , didn 't you ? You found the engineer . He 's here in LA . Where is he ? Where is he ? This is LAPD jurisdiction . We need to take him into custody . He stays here till I tell you he leaves . Who 's the engineer ? Amid Halebi . Saudi national with a PhD in Nuclear Physics . Was 20th terrorist on 9 / 11 , until he didn 't show up for the main event . Turns out , he fell for an American girl he 'd met a few months earlier . September 10th , 2001 , he went off the grid . And they tracked him here ? He brought the girl back to bury her . She died of cancer . Funeral was yesterday . He 's back on the grid . Let 's see if the Amazing Karnack here has some answers . Who is he ? Matthew Parkman . He 's eight years on the force , no commendations , no disciplinary issues . He 's undistinguished so far . You , come with me . Help me understand . How did you know he was in there ? I don 't know . I don 't . I just did . If you know where the engineer is , I think you better tell me . - The what ? - You recognize these ? Switching codes for rail transport . Top secret Nuclear Regulatory routes . Nuclear material , nuclear devices . Meaning : anyone with these codes could wreak a lot of havoc if they decided to send two trains down the same rail line . But you don 't know anything about that , do you ? No , ma 'am . I see in your file here that you 've taken the exam to advance to the SWAT team three times . - Yes , sir . You realize that there are physical requirements . I can ... I can lose the weight . How does that make you feel , son ? Flunking that test that many times ? ... Embarrassed . I guess ... angry . Angry enough to do something about it ? Take revenge in some kind of way ? You think I have something to do with this guy ? - Do you ? - I 'm telling you the truth . I ... I heard his voice . Do you have some place you gotta be ? It 's my wife , yes . I have a meeting ... At a what ? At a therapy session . It 's couples counseling . We 're ... We 're having some trouble at home . This guy 's worthless . Yeah , I was real sorry to hear about your father . He seemed like a good guy . Man , I thought I was a slob . They were here , too . - What ? - Nothing . I got a guy who can clean this up for 100 bucks . No . It 's all right . I 'll take it as it is . We rent by the week . I 'm gonna need to know you can afford it . I have a job . Doing what ? Driving a taxi . I 'll get you an application . Your son is a very intelligent boy . Gifted , actually . That 's not the issue . His father 's not around , and sometimes I think he could use a bit of a stronger hand , you know ? I work nights a lot , but we can both work harder . It 's not about the work . The truth is , I just don 't know if this school is the right fit for him . But he 's made friends . I 'm sorry . - He 's on the soccer team . - I 'm sorry . I wrote a check for $ 25,000 to get him into this snob fest . I was told that that 's what it took . That 's on top of the tuition . About the tuition . Your last three checks have bounced . Fine , take it out of the 25 grand that I gave you . That was a donation . And it was very appreciated . Well , I want my money back . I want my money back , now . That money went to the capital campaign for the new wing . - It 's already been spent . - Then unspend it . I 'm sorry . We could maybe discuss an extension of the money that you owe , but ... I want my money back . That 's not possible . Come on , baby , let 's get out of here . You 're too good for this lousy school . Mom ? Leave me alone . For God 's sake , Ma . Are you OK ? They dropped the charges . I have to fill out a form . No big deal . No big deal ? I 'm running for Congress . Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to me if it gets out , with our family 's past ? What could you possibly need so bad that you had to steal it ? Never mind , I don 't wanna know . - Socks . - Socks ? Dad left you a fortune . What are you thinking ? You know , it 's been one ridiculous stunt after another with you for the last six months . Dad 's gone , just get over it . You know what ? Leave her alone . She 's OK , that 's all that matters . Thank God Mom 's fine . She 's a criminal , but thank God she 's OK . Next thing you know she 's gonna be telling us she 's a crack whore . I gotta keep this out of the press . You know what ? Just get out of here . Go worry about your image , I 'll handle this . Yeah . Good . I gotta make sure this stays buried . - Thanks a lot , Mom . - Mmm-hmm . What were you thinking ? I just wanted to feel alive again . Nathan only cares about himself . Your father was the same way . Alpha dogs , both of them . You , in the meantime , for all your selflessness , and sitting with dying people ... What ? You 're gonna retire on what you make ? Maybe I 'll shoplift my socks . Don 't get smart . When you put everyone else first , you end up last . You always put Nathan first , he took advantage . Yeah , it wasn 't you that was just pushing him right out in front of me ? He takes up more space than you . Demanded more attention . And besides , it 's not my fault , you allowed it . He 's my brother . I love him . Love is overrated . He loves me , too . I know him . We 've always been close . Rose-colored glasses . That 's cruel , Mom . Look , since Dad died , I know you 've been feeling free to speak your mind , but it wouldn 't hurt to edit yourself , every once in a while . I 'm sorry if the truth hurts . I 'm just saying you hero-worshipped him . And those feelings were never returned . You 're wrong . It 's biological , and I can 't help it , we 're we 're connected . I never told you this , but when Nathan had his accident , I knew it . We all got the same call . No , I 'm saying before the call , like he was telling me , 300 miles away . I woke up , and I knew that he 'd been hurt . I hate it here . She doesn 't even have any books to read . Baby , I 'll be right back , I 'm just gonna go and pack up a few things . We should really go see Dad . What good would that do ? He could help . He should know that someone 's trying to hurt us . Your dad 's not in any position to help us right now . Look , I made some mistakes , I admit it . Mom , what 'd you do ? Hey . I need you to know that I would never let anything happen to you . I promise . Mom , why 'd you look at yourself like that in the fish tank ? - How long ? - Just a couple hours , tops . There 's some ice cream in the fridge . Go ahead . - What happened ? - I went to see Linderman . - How much ? - Thirty . You gambling again ? No , it 's just bills . And I used the rest to get Micah into private school . They didn 't know what to do with him at public , and I just ... I needed them to think that we had money . From the mob ? Hell , Niki . You weren 't born yesterday . I 'm just two weeks overdue . I mean , I thought that I could handle it , OK ? It 's just ... - I 'm under a lot of stress right now , OK ? - Gee , I wonder why ? I feel like I 'm kind of losing it a little bit . I 'm seeing things . Like ? Like I keep feeling like someone 's watching me . Yeah , Linderman wants his money back , so he sends some mouth-breather that 's gonna put you in the hospital . No , it is someone else . It 's someone that I can 't see . Does this make any sense to you ? No . I 'm sorry , you know what ? But I 'll tell you what does ... I shouldn 't be telling you this . No , no , let me tell you what does make sense . You need to come up with that 30 grand plus interest , now . Or you gotta run . Watch him . All right . Hiro . Cool , huh ? How hot do you think it is in there ? Turn on the camera . Scotty ! Scotty ! Come on ! Take it easy , you 're all right ! I 'm OK , I 'm fine ! Take it easy . There 's no burns . Get going ! One , two , three , four , five , go . One , two , three ... I missed you , Amid . Our bond is too strong to be broken by a woman . We are bound by our beliefs . I don 't believe in anything anymore . We trained together , we prayed together , went on haj together , we 're still brothers . You flatter yourself . Everything you planned is coming to pass . The computer virus got us the NRC switching codes . It 's all happening right now . We derailed the train in West Texas two hours ago . We have the device . When we get the plutonium , we 'll meet up in Idaho next month . We just need you to assemble it . What makes you think I would do that ? We started this together , we need to finish it together . Allah forgives you , so do I. We can 't do this without you . It 's because of her , isn 't it ? I killed someone I loved . I killed my own wife . I will not kill anyone else . What are you talking about ? She died of cancer . I read the obituary . When they bombed our camp in Pakistan , you and I buried 20 children that day . We dug their graves with our own hands . Put flowers on them , cried , said prayers . Just because you found love , doesn 't make the rest of the world stop suffering . People don 't respond to love . They respond to action . I 'm sorry ! There was a big bust this morning . Can we still make it ? Sure . Six minutes ought to be plenty of time to face our marital problems . And you 're the one that wanted to do this , remember ? No , I wanted this for us , OK ? You 're unhappy , that 's a problem . Oh , right , it 's my fault . No , I didn 't mean that . I didn 't pass . Again . If you think that makes a difference to me , then ... I never put any pressure on you to move up . I don 't care . I just want you to be happy for once . I want to be where the action is . I 've told you this . I 'm not gonna retire a beat cop . People get their dreams , why can 't I ? We 've been together 11 years , Matt . I 've made my dreams come true . How long are we supposed to wait for yours ? Why don 't you just tell them the truth ? Yeah , that 's a great idea . I 'll just walk in there and tell them I can barely read . I mean , half the words I see backwards , the other half I can 't even see ... Lots of people have dyslexia , Matt . It 's nothing to be ashamed of . I 'm under so much stress right now , honey , you 've no idea . Yeah , well , so am I. Actually , I think there 's something wrong with my ears , my hearing . Well then , go to a doctor . No , honey , listen to me . I 'm hearing , like , voices in my head . Like a crazy person ... telling you what to do ? No , no , it 's more like thoughts . I 'm hearing people 's thoughts . You know what , Matt , I have to go , OK ? I 'll see you at home . No . Please , listen to me . - This is ... - I can 't stand it anymore . You suffocate me . What are you doing ? Hello ? It is 2 : 30 in the morning . Who is this ? You 've been looking for me . Yes . Yes . Thank you for returning my call , Mr. Sylar . How did you find me ? Mr. Sylar ? Anyone there ? Using the Human Genome Project , I created an algorithm that mapped and traced chromosome changes in ... It 's very complex to describe in layman 's terms . I 'm sure you have lots of questions . Oh , I have questions , lots of questions . Am I good or evil ? Are we cowards or heroes ? Does God even know the difference ? Saint John of the Cross said there are two sides to a man 's soul . These two are at war within all of us . Has God abandoned me , Professor ? I know how confusing this must be , but you need to know that you are not alone . There are others . How is it manifesting itself for you ? Manifesting itself ? That 's good . I have so many questions for you . Can I meet you somewhere , someplace safe ? There 's someone following me , so ... No , I 'll find you . Don 't worry . And what time does that one leave ? And it takes , like , what , couple hours ? Well , can I just buy it there at the station ? Who are you talking to ? Nobody . Great , I 'm going down to the corner for a pack of smokes . You wanna come ? I 'll be right back . It wasn 't easy , Nathan , but consider it gone . I know I owe you big on this one , Tom . I 'm not gonna forget it . Yeah , I won 't let you forget it . - Thanks . - Sure thing . Mom 's rap sheet is now officially buried . It only took half my political capital to pull it off . Why can 't she get herself a hobby like a normal person ? They were married 41 years . It 's a plea for attention . She 's lonely . Give her some time , will you ? I don 't have time . I got eight days to make up ten points . I need all the help I can get , which is what I wanna talk to you about . I wanna offer you a job . - A job ? - Yeah . I trust you . You 're good with people . I need a coordinator to help organize the volunteers , and you got nice guy instincts , I could use that . I 'm a shark , Pete , everybody knows it . And it 's starting to show up in the polls . I bring you on , and it kind of reflects well on me , you know what I mean ? Yeah , all right , so I make you look good . That 's a new one . No , it makes me look like I put family first . I mean , I know that sounds self-serving , but this is for you , too , right ? You 've got to think of your future . - Why do you do that ? - Do what ? Even try to make it look like this has something to do with me ? You didn 't hear anything that I said earlier today , did you ? That bit about how you can fly ? Yeah . I did . I 'm gonna pretend for both our sakes you didn 't say anything like that . I 'm trying to do the right thing here . Look , I already have a job . Yeah , watching old people die , now there 's a career . It 's not cute anymore , man . The dreamy kid , sitting in the back of the classroom , staring out the window ? It 's time for you to grow up . Look , I cast a big shadow , Pete , I get it . Life isn 't fair . But there 's nothing I can do about that . I 'm trying to do the right thing by you here , OK ? I don 't want your pity . Hey . Corner of Center and Canal , please . Wow . Solar eclipse . Yeah , yeah , I wonder if it 's gonna be total . Not here , no . Some other part of the world , yes . A global event . Makes one appreciate just how small our planet really is . And we 're all quite small really , aren 't we ? What 's your name ? Mohinder . I 'm Peter . Let me ask you something , Mohinder . Do you ever get the feeling like you were meant to do something ... extraordinary ? I 'm driving a cab , you may have noticed . No , I 'm not talking about what you do , I 'm talking about who you are . I 'm talking about being special . Yes , we are all special . That 's not what I meant . Some individuals , it is true , are more special . This is natural selection . It begins as a single individual , born or hatched , like every other member of their species , anonymous , seemingly ordinary , except they 're not . They carry inside them the genetic code that will take their species to the next evolutionary rung . It 's destiny . Hey . Hey . I can 't believe you just left like that . Yeah , I know , I was there . You saved that dude 's life , he was OK . Welcome home . Get over there . Fifty grand is a lot of money . Fifty ? It was 30 . Even with interest ... Mr. Linderman wants to be nice about this . You should have read the fine print . Look , I have a son . I 'm all he 's got . Mmm . Please , I can get you the money . I 'll tell you what I 'm gonna do . I 'm gonna make you a little business proposition . You make , what , 40 bucks for every 20 minutes you take off your clothes ? Well , I 'm gonna give you a chance to lower your debt a little . And see where it goes from there . Come on . Come on , show me what you got . Lift up your shirt , baby . Oh , look at that belly . Smile for me . Is that what you want ? Ah , yes . What 's the matter , baby ? You just started getting good here . What 's the problem , baby ? I said , what 's the matter ? Screw you . Screw me ? Nathan Petrelli . He served his country in Bosnia . Hey . Oh , God . What ? The silent treatment ? Oh , boy . Isaac ? What the hell is wrong with you ? Isaac . OK , stop . What ... What , are you crazy ? Clearly . I don 't even remember painting these . - I was high , OK ? I lied to you . - Damn it . I 've been chasing for a month . Well , then , get yourself back into a program and make it stick this time . These are fantastic . No ! They 're evil . What are you talking about ? What am I talking about ? You know what I 'm talking about ? You see this ? Suicide bombing in Israel . I painted it three weeks ago . Yeah , so ? So ? That 's this morning 's paper . Look at the number on the bus . This happened yesterday . Yesterday . It was just a coincidence . You were high . For all you know , you could have painted it this morning . No . This is what I painted this morning . Something 's wrong with me . OK , we 'll get you some help . OK , Isaac ? I tried that , twice . There 's only one way left . And you know it . You can 't go cold turkey , not alone . I mean , let me help you , please . No ! I 'll drag you down with me , I swear to God , I will . Just leave me alone . Get out of here ! Now ! Manifesting yourself . That 's good . Ten percent of nothing is nothing . Jerk should be grateful I even signed with him . It 's not like I don 't love her . I just got horny , that 's all . Love isn 't a pie . There 's enough to go around . In the quietest of places , in the smallest moments , God is within me always . Captain . Captain . Captain , I got to talk to you . I can find out where they are . - Where who are ? - The rest of the cell . What are you talking about ? How ? The same way I found him . I just ... I just have to ask him . And I 'll need a translator . It 's gonna be in Arabic . - Arabic ? - Yeah . If he knows , I 'll find out . But ... there 's a condition attached . Hi , this is Niki . Leave me a message . Niki , if you 're there , pick up . Niki , look , please tell me that you have Micah , because he 's gone , along with 300 bucks from my purse . Just call me , OK ? Thanks . Where to , my friend ? JFK , please . I 'm going home to my family . These business trips are wearing me out . Suresh , huh ? I 'm sorry ? Your name.On your license , there . That 's Indian , yes ? There was a Professor Suresh at the University of Madras , a geneticist . Interesting theories . Don 't think he 's teaching anymore . But you wouldn 't know anything about that , would you ? Probably lots of Sureshes where you 're from . Like Smith or Anderson . And then Carla had the nerve to tell me he 's not breed-worthy . Like he didn 't win five all-breed rallies , two regionals . She says he doesn 't look sexy enough to breed . Can you believe it ? It 's just not true , Mr. Muggles . It 's not true . He 's a little stud muffin , that 's what he is . He still humps my leg when I watch TV . All right , enough about Mr. Muggles . What 'd everybody else do today ? Doug and I saw this Mexican guy . A homeless dude , on our way to school . We thought he was dead , but he wasn 't . I thought Dad was coming home today . Well , I was gonna surprise you . He finished up early , he 's coming home tonight . Isn 't that great ? Just in time to read my report card . So what about you , Claire , do anything special today ? I walked through fire and I didn 't get burned . What the hell is that supposed to mean ? God , you 're so crazy sometimes . Lyle . I think I know exactly what you mean . Oh , here I am , talking dogs again . And you go and say something really profound . We come up against all kinds of fires in our lives , and when we test ourselves and face our fears , we usually don 't get burned . You are very wise , sweetheart . Whatever it is you did , I 'm proud of you . And so is Mr. Muggles . He 's just so proud of Claire . Aren 't we ? We 're proud of Claire . Yes , we 're so proud of Claire , aren 't we ? She 's the best . Hiro . Hiro ! Oi ! What are you looking for ? Morphine . What for ? I need you to come with me someplace . Where ? You 'll see . Look , there 's ... There 's something I need to tell you . Now that is gonna have to wait . No . Look , I need to tell you about this , OK ? I need to stop living for other people . My whole life I 've had no idea what I 'm supposed to do , what I 'm supposed to be , if I even have a destiny of my own . I promise you we will talk about this later , OK ? But right now I really need you to come with me . You 're a nurse , you can give out a shot , you can help him . Help who ? I thought we could go to the movies this Saturday , maybe try on some shoes at the new mall in Gardendale . Sure . I love you , Mom . But ? No buts . I just ... I just wanted to tell you that . Now you think I 'm trying to be your best friend again , admit it . No . It 's all right , we can go to the movies together . It 's no big deal . I just miss you , that 's all . I wanna be your mom , I wanna give you advice . But I don 't wanna push you away . I want advice , I do . I won 't push you away , I promise . I just don 't think you should be so worried about fitting in all the time . About being so popular . I don 't want to see you make mistakes like I did . I wanted to be someone more interesting than I am . You are interesting . You breed show dogs . Whose mom does that ? No , I wanted to hitchhike across Europe . Study art . Fall in love with some ... poetry-quoting Frenchman . Not that your dad isn 't wonderful , but my point is , you should know who you are and know that it 's enough . 'cause who you are is special . About that . There 's something I need to say . Something I never talked about ' cause I thought it would upset you and Dad . Sweetheart , you can say anything to us , you know that . I think I 'm old enough for you to tell me who my real parents are . Of course you are . Honey , I 'm home . Your father . Hey , honey . Bad , Mr. Muggles . No . - I 'm glad you 're home . - Oh , me , too . I have such a headache . I slammed my head getting out of a taxicab . Hi , Daddy . Hey , baby . I 'll ask you one more time . And only one more time . Are you in ? You found me seconds before I died . How is that possible ? Fate . Maybe I was not meant to die . And maybe she was . Allah is merciful . He always has a plan . He has a plan for you , Amid . You 'll help us . It 's your purpose . Bring me a glass of water . The device you stole ... you 'll need more plutonium . How do you know that ? And not just plutonium . You 'll need enough P-235 , enough beryllium mixture , and you will need a lot more to take out your target . - A lot more . - Where do we get it from ? Untie my hands . Six months ago , I woke to something extraordinary . An ability . A curse . Where it came from ? I don 't know . But now , I think it might be my purpose . I can emit 45,000 curies of radiation from the palm of my hand . Enough to give cancer to those I love . Enough to detonate a five megaton thermonuclear device . Turn around ! Get against the wall ! Get against the wall ! Get against the wall , now ! Now , damn it ! Move it ! Hey , get your hands where I can see them . Amid ! Matt ? Hello , New York ! You sure your ride 's coming ? Yeah , I 'm sure . You be careful , son . Sylar ! I 'm just saying it 's impossible , OK ? Nobody can predict the future . I saw it with my own eyes , Peter . Isaac ? I brought someone here to help . He 's a nurse . Isaac . Isaac ? Isaac ? Maybe he went out . I don 't know . Isaac . Simone ! Oh , God . OK . Oh , my God . Isaac ? He 's alive . Call 911 . - I need a tourniquet . - What have you done ? Yeah , I 'm at 215 Reed Street , number 7 . I need an ambulance here immediately . Someone has cut off his hand . No , no , he 's conscious . Just barely . I know . Listen , could you just come ? Did you find something ? I think there 's some towels in the sink . OK , baby , it 's OK , they 're sending an ambulance right now , OK ? You just hang in there , OK ? We have to stop it . - Oh , baby ... - We have to stop it . This quest , this need to solve life 's mysteries . In the end , what does it matter when the human heart can only find meaning in the smallest of moments ? They 're here . Among us . In the shadows , in the light . Everywhere . Do they even know yet ? All right , I 'm here . Now what do you want ? Peter ? I 've been up here all night thinking about this . Thinking about my destiny . What are you doing , Pete ? It 's my turn to be somebody now , Nathan ! Come on , Peter , quit screwing around ! Peter ! Peter , hang on . How did you ... You 're flying . You 're flying ! I don 't know . I don 't know . Oh , God . - Peter . - Nathan !

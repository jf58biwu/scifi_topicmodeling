 She 's not in there . Sure ? You want to come and look ? Didn 't think so . She 's not in there . Course I 'm not . Dolly , are you all right ? She 's fine , Jenny . Tracy got her out . Thank you , Tracy . And thanks , Adele . Stay for lunch . Oh , no ! Lunch ! It 'll be charcoal by now . Jenny , Adele needs a little word . OK . The thing is ... the bedsit 's OK , but ... I know this sounds crazy , but I 'm missing you all . You 're my family . Well , I was wondering , if it was not too late , maybe I could have my old room back . If that 's what you want , you could . You don 't think I 'd be wimping out ? You think this is a soft option ? If Adele 's moving back , I suppose I will as well . Two independent girls together . But no fussing , no hassling , and no cheer-up jokes . We don 't need it . No way . You 're ready to come back ? No choice . You lot can 't manage without me .

It shall be done , Mistress . At breakfast times I am so hungry I could murder a bowl of cornflakes . Does that make me a CEREAL killer ? You 're not laughing . It wasn 't very funny . But I 've been studying jokes , their structure and history . You swap words around . So that was a joke . Well , I don 't think it 'll get you on the telly . So what makes a joke funny ? I 've read timing is important . But how ? I don 't know , it 's complicated . Is the context important ? Why does everything with you lead to about 500 questions ? Come on , I want a new bag . You 've got lots of bags . You can never have too many bags . Another thing I don 't understand . You 're a guy , you 're not meant to . What do you reckon , soldier ? Do you think you 're man enough to have a go ? I have to go shopping . Well , that 's kind of answered my question . Come on , Luke . Here you go . Cut-price vouchers in case you change your mind . Thank you . Thanks . Come on . Posters are up . I 'm doing a local radio piece at three , and I 've given the half-price tickets to a street team to shift . You wait , Mr Kudlak . The last few weeks ' takings will be nothing compared to what we 've got coming . Oh , we 've got a birthday party shoot ' em up booked in for tomorrow . HISSING ROAR I grow tired of your talk , Mr Grantham . Just bring me children ! This is Lance . Oh , thank you , Mrs Metcalf . I can 't begin to imagine what the last three days have been like . How you 're coping . I keep thinking my head 's going to break . That 's what it feels like . I 'm on edge every minute , thinking that he 'll walk up the path , or the police will come and tell me ... Children do turn up safely . There 's still every chance . Someone may have seen something without knowing it . My story might make them come forward . I hope so . Has anything like this happened before ? Lance has never run away after an argument ? We never argue . Me and Lance , we 've only got each other now . We know that life 's too short for rowing . I see . I 'm sorry . Well , perhaps you could tell me what happened on Saturday . Nothing happened , only Lance never came back . He was going out to meet his friend , Brandon . They were going down the arcade . He lives for his video games . Only Brandon never saw him on Saturday . Lance never showed up . He just vanished into thin air . Help me get my boy back , Miss Smith . Please . LAUGHTER Do you mind ? Ah , sorry , Sarah Jane . Clyde was just bogging around with Maria 's new bag . I 'm sorry ? Mucking . I was MUCKING around . Or messing . The words are important in slang , Luke . You can 't improvise . Sorry , we 'll get out of your way . No , no , wait . I saw the mother of that boy that went missing . Your friend , Lance Metcalf . Friend ? Don 't get me wrong , Sarah Jane , I hope he 's OK . But the Corporal 's not really been up for making friends . The Corporal ? Lance . Lance Corporal . And did you know his father was in the Army and was killed in Iraq ? Nicknames aren 't always funny . Well , I hope he didn 't run away because he was bullied . Luke made up the nickname . People laughed . I thought that was good . It wasn 't Luke 's fault . No-one knew about Lance 's dad . He didn 't tell anyone . He didn 't have much to do with any of us . At break he was too busy with his Nintendo . But I made a joke out of his name . Maybe Lance wanted friends , like I did . Instead , I probably made him run away ! Oh , no , Luke it was ... It 's all my fault ! No , Luke , look ... I 'd better go and talk to him . No . Let me . I did drop him in it . OK . Is he finding it really hard , Maria , to fit in ? No harder than the rest of us . Clyde will talk to him . He 'll be OK . How was Lance 's mum ? Oh , going out of her mind with worry . Do you think there 's something weird about Lance disappearing ? I mean , you don 't think there 's aliens involved , or anything ? I don 't see aliens behind every bush , Maria . I 'm not a conspiracy theorist . No , I know . I just wondered , that 's all . Now , this friend of Lance Metcalf 's , Brandon . Do you know him ? ELECTRONIC WEAPONS FIRE Hi , Brandon . What do you want ? This is my friend , Sarah Jane . Hi . I want to ask you some questions about Lance . That 's him . Halo ? Yeah , that 's Lance . He 's the nuts . Is that good ? Very . Oh . I was meant to meet him on Saturday in the park . We was going to go to the arcade . And did you ? Well , he never showed . The storm may have put him off . There wasn 't a storm . Are you calling me a liar ? No . But Saturday was warm and sunny . I was in the garden until dark . Yeah . Well , it was weird , wasn 't it ? It only lasted a minute . All these clouds came up the hill and then it just poured on me . Then the clouds just vanished and it was blue skies again . I mean , it was weird , and ... Frightening ? Yeah . Man , I thought you 'd gone AWOL , along with Lance . Been looking all over for you . Why ? Cos that 's what friends do . They try and help . And friends shouldn 't grass each other up . I 'm sorry . How did you " grass me up " ? Look , we 'll get back to Slang 101 another day . Ding-ding . New class . How the Corporal doing a runner has got nothing to do with Luke . Don 't call him that . He 's not here . I wasn 't trying to be cruel . I was trying to be funny . Yeah . Well , not everyone 's cut out to be me . .. See what I mean ? Kudlak ? I am here , Mistress . Time grows short . You must bring me children , Kudlak . Fresh , strong , children . I will , Mistress . You have my vow . This hunger for blood , it never ends . You shall have what you need , Mistress . Soon you shall have all the children you need . Have all these kids really gone missing in a year ? Mr Smith , we need to cross-reference these disappearances with reports of localised freak weather conditions . 'I will assimilate with meteorological databases . 'Processing initiated . ' I don 't get it . What has this storm got to do with Lance going missing ? That 's what we 'll find out . I don 't think Brandon 's the sort to be scared by a normal storm , do you ? Maybe there is something " weird " about Lance 's disappearance . 'I have a data-match for twenty-four children . ' Twenty-four ? 'Their disappearances all coincide with instances of unexpected 'but short-lived torrential rain . ' All towns and cities . Why would it rain like that ? 'Insufficient data . ' Well , Mr Smith , maybe we can get you some more . So what are we doing , exactly ? Pass me that spanner . What do you know about energy ? It can 't be created or destroyed . Very good . Now , a storm is created by , and in turn creates , energy . The residue in the atmosphere could tell us quite a lot . Now put those rubber gloves on and pass me those two metal cylinders , one at a time . No ! I said put the gloves on first ! Those are made from Cibrianite flux . Touch them both at the same time without protection and you complete a circuit that will put you out cold for an hour . Oh . You know , we should get my dad over . He 's good at DIY . We could say it 's my science project . He 's got lots of tools . Bet he hasn 't got one of these . Stand back . Sometimes it feels like I 'll never fit in to this world . When I made a joke about Lance 's name , it felt like ... like a breakthrough because people laughed . Instead , it was another social miscalculation . Gaffe , Luke . It was a gaffe . You said a " gaff " was where a " dude " lives . It 's different . Just stick to the text , OK ? You see ? Things are so complex . Complex ? ! Be grateful your old man didn 't run off with your Aunt Melba . Just listen to me . I 'm an expert in complex . So you can explain things ? Just ask Encyclopaedia Clydannica . Go on , anything you want . What 's the purpose of games ? Why play games ? This . This looks like war . But it 's a game . Why ? It 's just a laugh . But they pretend to kill people . OK . You want to find out ? Let 's do it . Mistress is worried . It has been a month , yet our returns are minimal . I can 't help the kids being low-grade . We must find better . We must work harder . Your Mistress should go out with a sandwich board . She could hand out some flyers . Do not mock my Mistress . It was a joke . OK ? We serve at her pleasure , Mr Grantham . Yeah , sure , sure . Neither of us is irreplaceable . Not I , and certainly not you . HISSING ROAR Ta-da ! Right , this is where Brandon got caught in the rain . Come on , let 's get her going . OK . Right , now , turn the dial ... on the left 6.02 for the electromagnetic pulse trace . Just got to calibrate the Kohonen net . Right switch to 15 and the middle to 2.6 . Now , then ... Right . Fire her up . BLEEPING Again . Oh . Nothing . Once more . There should be some sort of reaction . What 's happening ? It works ! My machine works ! 'Particles identified as entanglement shells . ' OK . And do you want to tell us what an entanglement shell is , exactly ? 'Used by climate engineers to terraform hostile environments . 'In order to support life , they stimulate rainfall . ' Ealing doesn 't need that . We get too much rain . 'If I might continue ? ' Please . ' Entanglement shells can also be 'a by-product of trans-dimensional energy dispersal . ' By what ? Teleportation . Aliens ! I knew it ! Lance was kidnapped by aliens ? Oh , they 've been kidnapping people from Earth for decades . The question is , why Lance ? And from where ? Mr Smith , can you pinpoint the exact centre of the storm on Saturday ? 'Weather geo-stationary satellites record every hour and are unlikely 'to have registered such a brief meteorological anomaly . 'I will access a military satellite . ' You shoot out people 's sensors . If you get hit , your gun goes down for five seconds and you lose a life . You get 100 lives . The person at the end with the most lives left wins . Last man standing . But I still don 't get the point . Wait until the adrenaline starts pumping ! 'Attention , Warriors of the Future ! 'Take your places at the Arena Doors . 'Prepare to do battle . Show no mercy , 'take no prisoners . 'This is a fight for survival . 'Only one can be the ultimate warrior . 'Battle commences in ten seconds ... ' Well , Grantham ? Have you brought me good stock ? I wouldn 't get your hopes up just yet . 'Four ... three ... two ... one ! ' Take no prisoners ! 'Commence combat ! ' THEY ALL SCREAM 'This is animated data from a NATO satellite covering Western Europe . 'Taken on Saturday at 1604 hours . ' THUNDER RUMBLES Run it again . And slow it down . People never vanish without a trace . There 's always a footprint , a tyre track . You 've just got to know where to look . Stop . Show me what 's right there , at the heart of it . I know that place ... We were there earlier , me and Luke ! Combat 3000 ! Cover me , cover me ! Watch out ! Go , Luke , I 'll cover you . Well , well , well . You 're not such a mummy 's boy after all , are you ? Mmm . Someone shows promise ? There 's a couple of kids . One of them is really something . Really going for it , it 's like he 's got something to prove . I smell warrior blood ! Mistress will be pleased . Aaaahh ! I wouldn 't bet your spaceship on it just yet . Let 's see if he makes it through Level Two . Hey , I won ! And look ! You came second ! Yeah . Beginners ' luck , I guess . Maybe we should go again . I thought you said it was for kids . It 's all part of your education . I 'm not enjoying it or anything . Impressive score , Soldier Eight . He says it was beginners ' luck . But I 've got better reflexes and hand to eye co-ordination than most kids . You do ? Wow . Well , you make one hell of a Future Warrior , Soldier . You mean I 'd be good at killing people ? .. If the eventuality arose . You don 't get invited to too many parties , do you ? I was showing him what to do . He 's Luke . Which makes me Obi-Wan Kenobi . Soldier Seven . How 's it going ? OK , listen up . Me and Mr Kudlak , he 's the proprietor , we run a special competition for the more skilled competitors . It 's Level Two . Now , what do you think ? Are you up for it ? Yeah ! Good . Welcome to the unique gaming experience that IS Combat 3000 . Zap those Drones . Hi . Erm , yep , I 'd like to book a party . I 've heard a lot about this place . Apparently it 's The Nuts . OK , let 's agree to never say that ever again . I wouldn 't if I were you . I 'm sorry ? For her , is it ? I 'd take her to see a film . You don 't want to come here , it 's mental . Used to be lovely and peaceful , till Mr Grantham took over . Mr Grantham ? Him and his partner , Mr Kudlak . Not that anybody ever sees him . Would it be possible to speak to him ? D 'you know , it always seems to be raining since they moved in . My sister 's offered me part-time in The Tanning Salon and I 'm thinking , " Well , you only live once . " Tell you what , why don 't we just go through . You 're busy . Hey ! Welcome to the unique gaming experience ... See him ? He does kick boxing , she does athletics for the county , and he 's in the football A team . This is wicked . It 's like Premier League for laser tag . OK , guys . Well done for getting through to Level Two . New arena , new objective . You 'll be split into four dispersement groups . You 'll access the arena from here , here and here . When the first siren sounds , you 'll break for cover . When the second siren sounds , the mission begins . Mission ? The first soldier to make it through the door , down the corridor and into this chamber will win their place in the World Championships . They have a laser tag World Championships ? ! That 's kinda why I said it . Now , this time , you don 't get 100 lives , OK ? You get ten . Ten ? Piece of cake . Do you think so ? A word of advice , son , the ultimate Warrior of the Future is always on guard for surprise attacks . Seems like a good place to start . SONIC SCREWDRIVER WHIRRS Whoa ! The others are playing by the old rules . To be the last man standing . If we work as a team , we 'll have the strategic advantage . Like I said . Piece of cake . ALARM SOUNDS Aaaargggh ! Grantham ... Grantham ! What are we looking for ? You 'll know when you find it . See what bubbles up . Does that mean you don 't know ? Not as such . Perhaps I can help ? Mr Grantham , I presume . Not Mr Kudlak . He likes to stay in the shadows . I wonder why that is ? Who are you and what are you doing in my office ? Sarah Jane Smith . Journalist . Who 's she ? My work experience girl . It was either this or putting up scaffolding . I 'm doing a story on laser games and their effect on aggression levels among young people . No comment . Now get out . Any comment on Lance Metcalf ? The boy that disappeared three days ago . 24 children have disappeared . Manchester , Brighton , Leeds ... All cities where there 's a Combat 3000 . Every time in the middle of a freak storm . Still no comment , Mr Grantham ? Do you know why people come to Combat 3000 , Miss Smith , hmm ? They come for the guns . A soldier that fights alone dies alone . These two will do , Mistress . 'Good , Kudlak . Send them to me . 'Send them to me ! ' In the name of the Emperor , it shall be done , Mistress . HE LAUGHS EVILLY OK . That 's it . The door to the World Championships . How many lives do you have left ? Six . You ? Four . I think we 're well ahead of the opposition . Are you ready ? Remember what the manager said . Be ready for a surprise attack . I am ready to rock ! I am ready to roll ! Move ! Oh , please , don 't be offended . This isn 't the first time I 've seen a gun , and guns from other planets ? Oooh , afraid I 've rather lost count . Will you die happy if I tell you that I 'm impressed ? I 'll die happy when I get Lance and the other children you kidnapped to their parents safe and well . Don 't worry about them , Miss Smith . Children adore war games . HE GROWLS AND LAUGHS Yeah ! Aaahhhh ! It 's raining . They 're powering up the teleporter . Get rid of them , Grantham ! Now ! FEEDBACK WHINES Don 't you have any conscience about what you 're doing with those kids ? Let me tell you about conscience . A conscience is like a stone in your shoe . You cannot begin to imagine the relief once you get rid of it . Goodbye , Miss Smith . Just a moment . Please . Just a moment . Bit of lippy ? Last request ? LOUD FEEDBACK Come on ! We don 't have much time ! We have to find that transporter and shut it down ! What happens now ? Do we get like a trophy or something ? I don 't know . But I 'm thinking this is kind of ... weird . Come on , it 's just a game . What exactly does a matter transporter look like ? Look ! It 's Luke and Clyde ! What 's going on ? No ! Be proud of them . MARIA SCREAMS Where have you sent them ? Where ? ! Into darkness ! HE ROARS Oh-ho ! Looks like things are finally picking up round here . You 're a disgrace to your own species , Grantham . Kids from all over must have gone missing . I doubt that men like you fare too well in prison . What 's with this Warrior stuff ? All we did was win a game of laser tag . Oh , yeah , we rock . It 's not Kudlak that calls all the shots . Whatever 's going on has got nothing to do with us . 'Prepare them for transportation to the front . ' Yes , mistress . Kudlak doesn 't see it like that . I 'll be back , Mr Grantham , I 'll be back .

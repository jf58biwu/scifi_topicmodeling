 Previously on warehouse 13 ... Can we get back to the warehouse computers Being breached ? Somebody is poking around in your system . I should never have told you . Warehouse 13 . I got hacked . Does Artie seem a little , I don 't know , crankier than usual ? Who 's there ? Someone 's there . I can hear- - What the hell was that ? Artie , what are you gonna do ? I know this place . I know this place . Yes . you 've been here before . You don 't remember it , but you will . Ahh . So this is a dream ? It 's time to get up , Artie . It 's time to go . W-where ? where am I going ? Back to the beginning . Yeah ? No more zoos , okay ? From now on , if an artifact is at a zoo , We leave it there . Monkey 's spit . Artie , do you know that ? They--they spit , and it is not pleasant . Guys , guys , guys- - tell him about the cheetahs . No , I don 't want to think about the cheetahs , right ? I just--I just- - I want a bath . All right , I 'm sorry about all that . I 'm dealing with a lot here too , okay ? Oh , right . Have you found out who 's hacking into the warehouse ? I can 't pinpoint the origin of the breach . It 's a little frustrating . Sleep . Artie , you look- - you look terrible . Thank you very much . You still have some monkey phlegm in your hair . It 's not- - is that- - It 's not phlegm . Look , Artie , uh , just- - Myka 's right . get some rest , bro , okay ? Look , just get back here as soon as possible . We have a lot to do . okay ? Oh , no , I-I can 't get up . Yes , you can . try . I can 't . - How 'd you get in here ? I 'm disappointed , Artie . I figured you 'd have me totally clocked by now . I don 't--I don 't- - do I know you ? What 's going on ? oh , I 'm hurt . Well , it was a while ago . I was a lot younger , so were you . Looking for this ? Dude , an alarm system ? So not groovy . Besides , this is you-and-me time right now . Yeah , it 's funny . Years ago , I swear you said you were just a simple professor . I guess you left out the , uh , off-the-grid , Top-secret warehouse full of madcap . Claudia . Claudia Donovan . You 're the breach . Knock , knock . Yeah , uh , I 'm sorry . I really don 't have time for games , And these cuffs , they 're not gonna stop me . Oh , I know , but check this . It 's supercharged cuffs , see ? 20,000 volts . Designed it myself . You like ? Well done . thank you . Now chill . I 'm not in the mood . Kid , look , that was a long , long , long time ago , that stuff . Time flies , professor . It really does . I 'm not responsible for Joshua 's death . Claudia , look , just stop it right now Before you do something you regret . I regret ? me ? Oh , have you got it back-asswards . You 're responsible for what happened . But , hey , it 's all good . you know why ? 'cause it 's payback time for me and for Joshua . So let 's go , Artie . Time to make good on your promise . The door 's open . That 's not good . Artie would never leave his Farnsworth . Yeah . If there were trouble , Artie would have triggered the- - Alarm ? Damn it ! I don 't know what else to do . The cache is wiped , there 's no tracks outside , And there 's no clues in here . All right , don 't worry , okay ? We 'll figure it out somehow ? don 't worry ? Could that be Artie ? I 'm calling for Artie . You two are decidedly not he . Mrs. Frederic , hi . Oh , look , we got some really bad news . Look , Artie 's gone . someone took him . That doesn 't happen . Agents don 't get taken out of the warehouse . Our security system is- - Oh . I see . The person who 's breached the security , He 's taken Artie . Yeah , any idea who this guy is ? None . So can we put out an APB or alert the authorities ? We are the authorities . What did you learn from the durational spectrometer ? The spectro- - It shows the afterimages Of anyone who 's been in the room in the last five hours . - you kidding me ? Yeah , that 's , like , our favorite thing , With all the lights and so forth . Once you 've ID 'd them , let me know . And stay put . I don 't need three missing agents . Oh , okay , but , Mrs. Frederic , look , If we have a lead , we could just- - Consider yourself under lockdown . I know this place . It 's a lab . it 's Joshua 's old lab . Come on . away from the door . I 'm fine right here . Think so ? Uh , or there . there is very good too . You 're doing this all wrong , Claudia . Brought me here in daylight , used my car . These are amateur moves , Claudia , and for what ? What are you gonna do to me ? You gonna kill me because a long , long time ago , Your brother died in an accident ? Come on . he 's not dead . Claudia ? Claudia , it was a terrible , terrible accident , But we both witnessed it , and he 's gone . No , no , no , no . He 's not . he 's stuck . Listen to yourself . No , this isn 't in my head ! You 're gonna see . Be careful . Okay , okay . Um , let 's- - let 's open this baby up , See what she 's got . That 's cool . Wow . okay . That is crazy . all right . Okay . wow . Okay . okay . Strange person of authority . Who is that ? I don 't know . who- - Hold on . who is that ? Hang on . I don 't know . Hang on . Do you have it ? okay , yes . Here we go , here we go , here we go . Okay , there we go . And ... that 's- - Okay , that 's weird . Did you see that ? Was he saying something ? What did- - what is he saying ? Do you--yeah . go--go--yeah . Wait , wait , wait , wait . That 's a trip . It 's--I can 't . " Claudia Donovan . " How did you- - My sister taught me how to read lips . Why does your sister ... ? Uh , the deaf find it handy . You- - Okay , Claudia Donovan ... Where are you now ? Mrs. Frederic said we should stay here . Really ? I didn 't hear that . Neither did I. Uh-oh , looks like she was institutionalized . What if she 's dangerous , Pete ? So , okay , this is what ? This is poetic justice , Bringing me back where it all started ? No , we 're here because it 's strongest here . We need that if you 're gonna bring Joshua back . Back ? You did a nice job on these , by the way . What 's conducting the charge ? Is that a lithium filament ? it 's very fine craftsmanship . Dude , just shut it down . Dude , can we not ? Claudia , you are- - you are not well . All right . Joshua 's death Was ... He got the rules wrong , Claudia . Yeah , ' cause he got sloppy , didn 't he , right ? We both know why he did that , don 't we , Artie ? Is Claudia in some kind of trouble with the secret service ? In the four years that Claudia lived here , Did she ever give you any problems ? No , not at all . she was very nice . Well , what can you tell us about Claudia ? Well , I 'm not one to gossip , but you might not know . She lost her parents when she was just a child . Poor thing . her brother raised her . Then a few years later , he passed too . Can you believe it ? More bad luck than a turtle on his back . She went off to live with a foster family . Well , if you ask me , I think it all just finally hit her . And then six months ago , she checked herself Into a psychiatric-care clinic . You know about that ? Of course you do . you 're the government . You probably know what pills I take in the morning . Anyway , she keeps up on her rent . She checked herself out two months ago . Has she contacted you ? Well , no , I haven 't seen her . She 's got a home base somewhere . Did she ever , um- - did she ever stay with friends ? I don 't think so . She kept to herself . No boyfriends , no girlfriends . I 'm very nonjudgmental . Here we are . Thank you , Mrs. Richman . We 'll just take a look around . I guess I can trust the secret service . Oh , boy . I 'm guessing this is the brother . Uh , I don 't want to sound like a broken record , But what makes you think that Joshua 's still alive ? 'cause dead people don 't visit , Einstein . Oh , he--he visits you ? Yeah , a lot lately . Your brother Joshua visits you , And he tells you he 's not dead ? Yes . I 'm not appreciating the snark , by the way . Rheticus was right , you know ? His theories ? no , no . Joshua was right too . he was this close to proving it . No , Rheticus ' experiments were never re-created . Never . he was nuts ! Joshua 's gone . You are gonna be so put down when he gets here . Yeah ? well , you know , I 'll take my chances . God . It 's about the minerals , professor , The minerals in the metal . That 's what should have made it all work . Sure . you know what I 'm sensing here ? That this is kind of a private chat . Some brother-sister thing . What do you need me for ? - Because I took it as far as I could , And now I need you to help me bring him home . You made me a promise . Something 's wrong . That 's what I 've been saying , you fossil . God . something 's wrong . I can 't- - I can 't- - I can 't- - Professor , I 'm Joshua Donovan . Joshua ? Are- - yeah , I remember this . This is when I met you . We 've met before ? Yes . no . Well , you showed me your experiment . You thought I was here to give you a grant , and ... That been happening a lot ? What ? You went back . N-no . I have the visions too . We 're mad connected , Artie . The difference between us is ... I-I-I didn 't ignore them . What 's wrong ? - What 's the matter with you , Claudia ? It usually happens just before . Just before what ? You 're gonna want to sit down for this . He 's here . Joshua ! What is that ? what is happening ? Joshua ! Joshua ? Joshua ! Told ya . What the hell was that ? I don 't--I-I don 't understand what just happened . What 's going on ? I mean , what the hell was that ? That was Joshua . No . yeah . You saw it too . I 'm not crazy . Yes . Yes , I sa--I-I saw Joshua . How ? Because he 's not dead . Now you know it too . help me bring him back . Well , I-I-I wouldn 't know where to start . Well , I 've got everything here . The Feldkirch minerals , equipment for an electric field . Claudia , did you try to re-create Joshua 's experiment on your own ? Oh , you 're such a creaker . Yeah , of course I did . The question is , why didn 't you ? So far , none of this stuff is telling me Where Claudia might have taken Artie . Are you finding anything ? For a kid , she seems pretty focused on the 16th century . She 's definitely a thinker . Always dangerous . Rheticus . Rheti-who ? He was a , uh , mathematician and mapmaker , A student of Copernicus . Yes , Pete , I read books growing up . Right . why go to the prom ? Of course you did . Yeah , three times in one night . Mm . It 's a long story . I bet it is . I bet it is . Well , it looks like our girl genius Took something with her . Just- - you know , just to clarify , You decided to re-create a clearly dangerous , Potentially deadly experiment ? Oh , sure. it sounds bad when you say it like that . Claudia , these are very real forces That you 're playing with here . And if you stop to think- - Chill out , obi-wan , okay ? I 'm trying to save my brother 's life here . I really hope that we are trying to save it together . Look , I 've spent the last two years of my life Trying to figure out what happened to Joshua . And when I reached the end of what I could do , I just kind of sort of took a peek at your research . W-what ? you took a peek ? You hacked Into highly classified government files . Ooh , I 'm all puckered . You know , imagine my surprise when I discovered That you had done nothing to help him . In 12 years , nada . I thought he was dead . Oops . wrong . Now you can help . Don 't tell me you don 't want to . I know you have guilt . Hey . Hey , look at me ! I don 't . Whatever helps you sleep at night , professor . Hey , you all right ? I 'm fine . lay off . Oh , yeah , you 're fine . yeah , sure . The nosebleed is , what , just for fun ? Oh , damn it . I 've been jamming for answers . I 'm just a little burned out . Yeah , and then I 'm just gonna guess That it 's getting a little worse ? Uh , o-okay . It 's , like , three or four times a week now . But it 's just stress . I mean , you get stressed , you get the flu . Everybody knows that . it 's not the flu , dummy . You 're so close to this , You can 't see that it 's your connection to the experiment That 's making you sick . no , please . It 's--it 's just- - it 's ... It 's just ... Yeah . Rheticus was attempting human teleportation , So was Joshua . It 's beyond dangerous . Look , it 'll be ... A little easier for me to see what you 've got If you took off the cuffs . " when love is lost and loss oe 'rtakes me , " the rules of love then are hidden ; " and chaos rules and order lost , And hidden then , my heart , from love . " Hey . What is that ? Nothing . Um , nothing . it 's not important . Hey . Hmm ? Um , a compass . Rheticus claimed he owned it , only no one ever saw it . It says here it probably never existed . It 's just ... Folklore . Okay , now , is it just me , Or does that sound all artifact-y ? Well , you 've got the Feldkirch minerals , And you 're using an electrical field , But what about the rest ? The compass , it disappeared with Joshua . My question is , what are you using instead of the compass ? Aren 't the minerals enough ? uh-uh . It 's the same as the metal in the compass . It 's the same thing . uh-uh . You can 't just replace an artifact With , you know , something else . There 's always an " x " factor . Okay , which is maybe why I need your help , Which is why you shouldn 't have done this at all . I 'm shutting you down . No , hey , hey ! You said you were gonna help me . What I said was I would look , Which I now have . And believe me , shutting you down ... That is helping you . Okay , fine . you know what ? Fine. just do it . just shut me down . You abandoned him once . why shouldn 't you do it again ? It isn 't like that . Oh , no , it 's exactly like that ! Joshua and me on our own again . It 's a good thing I 'm used to it . I know that it hasn 't been easy . No . No , it hasn 't been easy . He was all I had after our parents died , And then he was gone too . He spent his fun years Sewing girl scout patches And teaching me how to fold an omelet ... And then reading Maria Looney on the red planet To me every night . He was a genius who put his life on hold for me . None of that 's your fault . I opened a door to wherever he is , And now he 's in pain . You saw his face . That is my fault ! me ! I 'm the epic fail . Claudia , it is making you sick . I owe him ! And so do you , and we 're running out of time . Damn it , Artie ! Help me save Joshua . It 's a pay phone . what ? Lattimer . Pete , how are you ? how you doing ? Artie ! Artie , hey , man . Are you all right ? ask him where he is . Oh , yeah . no , I 'm--I 'm okay . I 'm okay . I 'm just here with an old friend , that 's all . Claudia Donovan . Very good . You ready my lips using The durational spectrometer , didn 't you ? Where is he ? where--wait . He probably doesn 't know . right , right . Artie , do you hear anything like a freeway , machinery ? Train whistles. ask him if he hears any train whistles . Guys , hey , hey ! Look , uh , the truth is that I 'm helping her , all right ? You 're helping her ? He 's helping her ? You 're- - you 're helping her , Artie ? I figured that you 'd be halfway towards finding us , But you can stop now . Did you hear me ? you can stop . No , Artie , she 's been under observation At a psychiatric facility , all right ? Oh , I-I-I had no- - Poor kid . I didn 't know . No . no , not poor kid . Poor Artie . she 's obsessed with you . She 's obsessed with the warehouse , And I 'm not letting you stay with her . What ? you 're not letting me ? That 's really cute , Myka . Cute ? cute . She 's cute ? does she have a gun on you ? Okay , look , these kids ' lives were messed up by- - They 're in trouble . I can help . That 's all you need to know . Well , let us come and help you . No , no , no , no ! We have everything we need to make this work , And I 'm telling you I 'm fine . Well , Artie , wait , wait , Artie , Artie- - He hung up . Seriously , you know ? If Mrs. Frederic can call us , we should be able to call her . Is there a star 69 on this thing ? Star 69 wasn 't invented when that was made . No , this wasn 't invented when this was made . Why doesn 't Artie want us to help him , Pete ? What 's going on ? Yes , what 's going on indeed . man , I really hate that . I believe I told you to stay put . No , I-I know . Um , it 's just that we were going to- - You know , it would be nice if we could contact you . We had a lead . we decided to follow it . Don 't--don 't make her angry . What kind of lead ? Well , uh , Artie is--is with , uh , Claudia Donovan . Voluntarily . Do you know where they are ? It 's possible . But we 've got bigger fish . You need to get down to the warehouse floor . Find the San Anselmo grid on the larkspur shelf , Number 1021 , Section 40594904 . Wait , we have a right to know where Artie- - Ms. Bering , your right extends Exactly as far as I say it does . If Artie is working with Claudia , He may be trying to re-create her brother 's experiment . And that 's bad ? where do you work ? Right . the Rheticus compass . Yes . His experiments were successful . That 's why he didn 't disappear into thin air . And Joshua did . yes , something went awry . You have to glean how Joshua went wrong 12 years ago . I still don 't understand why you don 't tell us- - What ? tell you where he is ? If you run after Artie Governed solely by your affection for him , You won 't be helping him . I don 't think it 's a bad thing to care about Artie . He needs information , not emotion . You go empty-handed , The experiment ends up just as it did before . You 're merely two more lost bodies . Thank you . So what are we looking for on--on the San Anselmo grid ? I 'm not certain . But every artifact in this warehouse Is an extension of a person . Understand Rheticus , understand the compass . And for the record , I care a great deal What happens to Artie . " Glean . " Ms. Fancy . You 're lucky that I have an emergency travel kit In the trunk of my car . Well , " serendipity " is my stripper name . Okay , so without the compass , What I 'm hoping is that some of these Will be able to help us get A much , much stronger electrical charge Than what you were able to get using conventional means . Now , to electrify the Feldkirch minerals To a higher frequency ... Ben Franklin 's lightning rod . I thought his thing was a key . Oh , no , no , no . everybody fixates on the key . No , no , please . this is much , much better . Trust me . well , um , what about- - Ah ! That 's terrifying . Uh , listen , um , I heard about the psych ward . I had no idea . I 'm sorry . Yeah , well ... Hey . it 's his journal . Take a look . Joshua 's ? Mm-hmm . Okay . See , this is- - that 's the rubbing at the edge- - " Useless . " " Useless . " " Useless . " " Useless . " I 'm guessing Artie thought these things were useless . I mean , they 're all Rheticus gadgets , But none of them tripped Artie 's trigger . Okay , so Joshua had to follow all these rules To try and make the compass work , right ? The kid even figured out This complicated differential equation . He was a genius . Yeah , and the compass still didn 't work . Well , it half worked . Ooh . What is that ? It 's en--it 's engraved with the--the letter " t . " " t . " why not an " r " and why " t " ? I don 't know what it means . Okay , look , Artie 's notes said that Rheticus ' work Often expressed a need for order . So what did Joshua miss ? I mean , maybe he translated something wrong , or- - I don 't know . I don 't know . I don 't know. maybe . What are you doing ? Rules and order , right ? right . Okay , well , after spending the last couple of months With someone who also likes those things- - Uh , you know , crosswords , puzzles . I like puzzles . so ? So ... So did Rehticus . A secret panel . I 'm increasing the power of the electrical field here By about 17 times where you had it , So you might want to stand back . Yeah , standing isn 't really an option right now . You all right ? Oh , super . what ? Artie , he 's almost here . I know . I ... Uh , I-I feel a- - Uh , I feel ... Feels like something familiar . Listen , I know , I know , I know . It 's all , uh- - it 's all folklore . I-I know this place . I know this place . Professor ? I-I have found all of the instructions that I need . I have the equation for the electrical field . I have all of these things . Nobody believes that Rehticus succeeded . I mean , it 's probably just a bedtime story , Joshua . That 's what you think . Joshua doesn 't get the concept of being nice to the money guy . Ah . do you want the professor To recommend you for the grant or not ? See , Claudia here doesn 't get the concept of being ten . Joshua , please don 't do this . It 's okay , professor . He may be antisocial , but he 's very smart . He knows what he 's doing . Does he ? This . This is his compass . I know I can re-create what Rehticus did . It 's teleportation , professor . please don 't . Hey ... Trust me . I started having the dreams two years ago . It 's what got me started on all this . It 's because we were both here . Hang in there , kid ! This should be a good first run ! May be able to slow him down with this one ! Yeah , got it . hold--hold on . Claudia . Claudia ! Claudia ! Claudia ! Claudia . Claudia . Man , this guy was nuts for secret panels . Yeah , and they weren 't mentioned In any of Claudia 's books . Yeah , and if she didn 't know , It 's a safe bet that Artie and Joshua didn 't know . You see the writing around these edges ? Yeah , it 's Latin . Oh . Let me guess . You speak Latin too . Okay , make one more nerd joke , And I 'm gonna point out how you 're losing your hair . Okay , so the rules , right ? The rules are in Latin , And rules teach us how to use the objects . So Joshua took them off the compass himself . Yeah , but he was missing something . Rheticus hid some rules . And Joshua never saw them . Nice . Hmm . You don 't have it high enough yet , Artie . I 'm stuck . no , Joshua , I-I can help you ! No , Claudia 's tied to this now . It 's killing her . And you , you 're tied to this now too . She 's the one I 'm worried about . Joshua , if you come back twice more ... I can hold you here ! I can save you both ! No , will you look at her ? This place is growing increasingly unstable , And it 's getting worse . Next time I show up here , it 'll kill her , okay ? Listen , you have to cut the tether . All right , overload the electrical field . Just--the conductor you 're using- - The , uh , lightning rod ? Yeah. blow it up . just use that . No , that 'll destroy the whole- - It 'll kill you , Joshua ! I know . You can 't save us both . To save her , you have to kill me . Do it before I 'm pulled back here again . So there 's something hidden on the compass . And we think it 's the rule that Joshua missed . Nicely done . Right , yeah ? now check this out . In Artie 's notes , it said that Joshua Had everything that he needed for his experiment in his lab . Where it was locked up for 12 years . But before Artie hung up , He said that he had everything that he needed . Bing , bang , boom . Claudia took Artie to the lab . You took the initiative , And you recognized what needed to be done , All in Artie 's absence . I 'm pleased . I know , right ? score Why the test ? Was Artie going somewhere ? Let 's hope not . The directions are in the file . You should get to that lab and quickly . We don 't know how much time we 've got left . Do you think she 's weird ? I think she 's weird . she always acts weird . Joshua come- - come and gone already ? Yeah . " Craptastic . " Here . Well , at least we 're closer to bringing him back . Okay , you all right ? Yeah , no , I 'm fine . Listen . yeah ? Thank you . Teleportation is such a powerful weapon , And people want it , Joshua . They 're gonna come get it . Well , I think I 've finally solved the equation . Listen to me . I could just lay low . Listen to me . People--the people- - The people that want it , want it now . They 're coming after you right now . There 's no time left , Joshua . What you have to do is you have to ... Protect yourself . Just protect your family . Just give me the compass temporarily . I know exactly where to put it where it 'll be safe . It 's , um ... It 's in my professor 's office . Good . You stay with Claudia till I get back . I 'll just be a minute . Hey , thank you , professor . Sure . Hey , what are you doing ? I made a promise to your brother , And I 'm not gonna let anything happen to you . What ? We 're blowing this up . That 'll kill Joshua . Artie , you have to put that back . You have to have the field ready to catch him . No , no , no , no , no . That 'll kill you , and I don 't care if you hate me . I 'm not gonna let you die too . I do hate you . I 'm never gonna forgive you . He 's on his way . Good . that 's good . What 's wrong ? Huh ? oh , nothing . Yes , something . What ? Uh , it 's just your brother . he should be back by now . You know what ? why don 't we go check on him ? Okay ? Don 't worry . I won 't let anything happen to Joshua , I promise . Claudia , I don 't have much time before it starts again . I 'm sorry ... For everything . But I 've got to save one of you . Showtime . Showtime . Artie ! Joshua ! I told you not to do this ! I told you not to follow me . Okay , well , dock our pay . we came here to save you . Is that Claudia Donovan ? Yes , yes , she 's- - she 's just unconscious . What ? what ? Joshua didn 't have all the rules , Artie . Rheticus loved puzzles . And his designs had secret panels . It 's inside ? It 's inside the compass . Yes , in Latin . where is it ? Artie , where is the compass ? We just have to pop open the panel And find out which rule it is , so where is it ? I don 't--I don 't- - I don 't have it . I had to try , Artie . I couldn 't give up without trying . Once you said that there was no more time left , I had to prove that I could teleport . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . Artie , what are you doing ? I 'm--I 'm doing what Joshua did . No , no ! that 's how he died ! He 's not dead . Claudia ? I think I can save him . I thought what I have to do- - Don 't do this ! Artie ! Artie , make him stop ! You promised ! Claudia , it 's okay . Remember , I will always , always- - Artie , what 's happening ? It 's not over . Joshua ? Touch my hand . Joshua ! Uh , okay . Where the hell are we ? Claudia , Artie , you 're here . Joshua . Look at you . you- - I can 't believe you 're here . Yeah , I 'm here . I 'm here . Wait . I 'm here ? You took me to the inter-dimensional space ? You were supposed to get him out , d-bag . No , he was supposed to destroy it . Clearly , he 's insane . Children , don 't fight , please . I can be both a d-bag and insane . Just where 's the compass ? It 's right there . All right . Rheticus put rules right on objects , Sometimes inside objects . A hidden panel . yeah . Yes , yes , yes . In this case ... It requires a combination , But they didn 't mention a combination . Wait . Letters or numbers ? It 's letters , but- - how many ? I mean , there 's 20-something letters . Artie , try t-h-o-m-a-s . Why ? " Thomas . " Rheticus wrote a poem , the loss of reason , About his lost love , somebody named Thomas . Thomas , okay . How did I miss that ? Ah , Latin . Oh , crap . no , no , no , no . It 's fine . I can read it . It 's just directions . It 's just , " move the dial 90 degrees Towards axis . " I 'm no expert , but maybe hang on ? Okay , touch ... . Artie ? Are you okay ? Thought we lost you , buddy . Oh , thanks . Thanks for not giving up . Shut up ! So the secret-panel thing- - I got to say , very nice work . Well , we were motivated . You know , maybe you should ditch us more often . I 'm really sorry about that . If you ever do that again , I 'm not finding you , And I quit . Yeah , just out of curiosity , by the way , How exactly did you figure out the secret-panel thing ? Well , each artifact is an extension of the person , Artie . We gleaned what we needed from the person . Mm-hmm . Mrs. Frederic . I thought so . No , hey , hey , you know what ? she 's pretty scary , man . If we hadn 't found something , She probably would have glared us to death . Yeah . you have no idea . What ? It 's just , um ... It couldn 't have been easy losing someone On the job like that . It wasn 't . Well , you know , if you ever want to talk about it- - I don 't want to talk about it . Okay . Oh . Oh , um , you know , unless you want to talk about it . I mean , unless you wa- - Look , anytime you want to talk about it is fine , okay ? Okay . Okay , bye . Bye . Bye . Hello , Mrs. Frederic . Arthur . An in-person visit . Must have done something right ... Or wrong . It 's a little of both . I had to go back . I know . I was responsible ... back then . You wanted him to teleport ? Oh , I thought he could do it . No . I knew it , so I pushed him . And he was lost for 12 years . And you might have prevented it all ... And I might have saved Gus , but I didn 't . We make mistakes . some people are lost . We can 't save everyone- - something to keep in mind Regarding Mr. Lattimer and Ms. Bering . That 's not why I 'm here . Then why ? Um , the girl , Claudia ? We didn 't do a very good job of protecting her , did we ? Well , she was determined to find her brother . And in the process , she learned a great deal About the warehouse , which could become problematic . She wouldn 't hurt us . But others might . And ? You know what the options are .

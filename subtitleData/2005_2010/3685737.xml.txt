 My name is Jane Vasco . I could use you on my team . I work for a secret government agency that hunts neuros . People who can do dangerous things with their minds . On my first assignment ... Something a little weird happened , okay , something really weird . Until I get some answers I 'm getting on with my life , doing my job . Stocking up on aspirin , because I have to tell ya , pain 's a bitch ! hello ? Anybody in here ? oh , my God . Hey , man , you all right ? some people say physical pain is easier to deal with than emotional pain , but then again , they 've never fallen 40 stories and lived to tell about it . Not to mention being shot , stabbed , beaten and lasered . What a fun time it 's been since I left the D.E.A. And joined them up with the neuro hunters . Still I understand what they mean , for me physical pain is horrible but at least it 's temporary . The other kind seems to hang on forever . If I had to chose one over the other it would probably be the physical . But then again ask me next time I get hit by a truck . Alright showtime ! This is a restaurant in Thermopolis , Wyoming . A patron named Alan Sloane stacks up the furniture then climbed out through the skylight . Margot Branton 's place three weeks later . By the way , when they people were found , they were lying on the floor , shivering and catatonic . James Cho was working late in his office this night . That was two days ago . Is he crying ? He looks freaked . What 's he hiding from ? No idea . Security cameras don 't reveal any kind of threat . He stacked everything up beneath a window , just like the other two . In mr . Cho 's case , the window was too small . He chokes himself to death . What about the others ? Have they received any kind of treatment ? Sloane and Branton are still under going treatment . Sloane attempted suicide and it 's questionable whether either will fully recover . How do they explain what happened ? They can 't . They barely remember doing it . Tox screens ? Clear . And none of these people had any history of mental instability before the event . So whatta we have ? A neuro who gets their kicks outta driving people crazy ? Any connection between the victims ? None , that we can tell . Different backgrounds , different professions , complete strangers . I 'd like to know if there have been any other cases . Can you get me into ... ? Every medical database in the civilized world ? Gimme a half hour . Yeah . Okay , 45 minutes . It would be useful if we could trace back to the first victim , patient zero . The first victim would , most likely , be the closest to the source . Miss Branton ... Yes . I 'm sorry , what were you asking ? If anything unusual happened before your ... Breakdown ? Unusual ? No . I went grocery shopping that morning . I came home , put things away . Then I heard this sound ... A deep noise , thumping and creaking , all around me . And I was so afraid . Of what ? I don 't know . I had to stay quiet . What were you hiding from ? I can 't rember . I don 't want to ... Please try . Out . I just needed to get out . Why ? Don 't you think they 've asked me that a hundred times ? I don 't know why . I just knew if I couldn 't find a way out I would die . You were in a restaurant and the door ... But I 'm not in a restaurant ! Where were you ? Somewhere ... Cold . Small . Closing in all around me . Collapsing ? No ... I don 't know . Okay , okay , You said there was a creaking sound . Anything else ? Light . Above me . I had to get there , but I couldn 't reach . There was something in front of me . Flowers . Flowers . Good ... What else ? I don 't want to do this ... Please . Keep going . What else ? There was a hat . A hat , you saw a hat while you were climbing ? Yellow ... A rain hat . So cold ... Okay , okay ... You 're doing fine . Something else , brushing against me . I turned to look ... I turned and ... Mr. Sloane ? Mr. Sloane , are you okay ? Get that away from me ! Get it away ! It 's okay . It 's okay , it 's okay . Oh , God . He had a very strong reaction to my gun . Well , you 're a women carrying a piece . Maybe he 's not as crazy as everyone makes him out to be . Makes more sense than being terrified of flowers . Guns and flowers . Maybe they 're holding an Axl Rose nightmare . Whatever Sloane was trying to get away from ... Whatever he was seeing ... Clearly terrified him . In a small , enclosed space . It 's all so damn vague . What about mass hallucination ? It 's not unheard of . But doesn 't that usually occur among people who are in the same place at the same time ? No ! No ! No ! Grab her ! No ! Please , don 't hurt mommy ! Help ! What ? I don 't think our victims are suffering from mass hallucination . Okay , I 'm listening . What if we have a neuro that can pass on one nightmare at will , to anyone they chose . A neuro who can infect others with his nightmares . Nightmare . In this case , the same one over and over . The question is why . If we only had more details of the dream . We could piece the facts together ... Facts ? Recurring nightmares is often associated with past experiences . Especially traumatic ones . I know that for a " fact . " does the little lady have bad dreams ? Tell me , sweetheart , what 's your nightmare ? I 'm looking at it . At least you 're dreaming about me . Wait for it and ... Boom ! Got it . Patient zero . First reported case of this type . Twenty-eight minutes for the record . Does that include yesterday ? I just started today , thanks for coming out . Alright ... This is the first case I could find . Went back ten years . Nothing . This went down one month before Alan Sloane popped his cork . Henry Perkins . I know that name . It was all over the news around ten years ago . Man had an argument with his family . Settled it with a butcher knife . The kid who cut his parents ' throats while they slept , burned down the house , went next door did the same thing to the neighbors ? Exactly . He 's been at Graymore psychiatric ever since . Was given cafeteria privileges . when he pulled the same stunt as Cho , Sloane and Branton . Our three other victims . If Riley 's right ... If ? If Perkins is patient zero that could place him close to the source . I know henry very well . I 've been in charge of his case since he came to the institute . He was an unhappy kid . Unhappy ? He killed six people . The best we 've been able to do is keep him stable . Does " stable " include the incident in the cafeteria where he piled up all the furniture and tried to climb to the top ? I hear he caused almost a riot . Henry 's still reluctant to discuss that . Is there a way we could find out who he had contact with henry that day ? Probably the same people who see him every day . the floor nurse , orderlies , What about other patients ? Visitors ? Henry doesn 't have visitors . Good one . You 've been practicing . Good morning , elyse . Hello . How are you feeling ? Wonderful . I sketched a butterfly this morning . He just sat there , like he was posing for me . Very nice . Take it . Thank you . And how are you , Teresa ? She hasn 't said a word today . She won 't even look at me . I got into medicine to try and cure people . I 've become a warden . But I 'm sure you didn 't come here to hear a lecture on the current state of the medical profession . Doctor , we 've seen other cases ... Who experienced the same nightmare as henry . We 're trying to piece together the facts behind the nightmare . Dreams are rarely factual . But people do relive specific experiences in their dreams . Yes , but dreams are complex , combinations of fact and fantasy . Very rarely literal . So a cigar isn 't always a cigar . These recurring images , a yellow rain hat ... ? ... could mean many things . Different to each person . I 'd like to find out what it meant to henry . I 'd be glad to ask him in our next session . I was thinking more of a face-to-face . I 'm afraid that won 't be possible . Doctor , I 'm afraid that isn 't your call . We need to see him now . Henry will remain in his restraints at all times . Don 't approach him , and don 't get him too agitated . If you feel threatened in any way , there 's a panic button by the door . I can have ten orderlies to you in under a minute . Send seven , I 'm here . I need your weapon . And anything else potentially dangerous . You gotta be prepared . You are not prepared for this . What do you want ? To ask you some questions . Well , I 'm kinda busy right now . I can come back later . You another doctor ? No . Writing a book about psycho killers ? No . Then it must be my birthday , and they finally got me what I always wanted . Hope you 're into bondage . Depends on the guy . I hear you rearranged the cafeteria while back . So the doc tells me , I don 't remember . You rember doing it in your cell a week later ? No . Then again in the exercise yard , and again in your cell ... ? I said no . You 're a cop . In a way . How many people have you shot ? Why ? Just trying to figure out what we have in common . I thought you used a knife . They get just as dead , don 't they ? Tell me about the cafeteria . You deaf ? I told you I don 't ... I don 't believe you . Why does a cop even care about some lunatic tossing around a few chairs ? Because you 're not the only one . What do you mean ? Tell me about the cafeteria . You tell me what 's going on . What the hell 's happening to me ? You remember something , don 't you ? Sounds , feelings , hein ... A deep creaking noise . Get out ! Dr. Lewis ! You 're all alone in a cold dark space . There 's a light above you and you have to get to it . Henry ? Where are you ? He 's coming . Who is ? Who 's coming ? I can 't ... I can 't get out ... Jane , get out of there . Open the restraints ! I have to see what the nightmare makes him do . It 's the only way . Do it now ! Where are we , Henry ? Have to get out ... What do you see ? A light . Up there . I can 't reach . It 's okay ... Let me help you . There 's someone here . Can you see who it is ? It 's a ... a man . Please , don 't ! You 're seeing things . Flowers , and a yellow rain hat . Tell me about the man . Can you see who it is ? What does he want ? No ! Can 't breathe ! Have to get out ! Open the damn door ! No , no , no , no ! Do I need a prescriptionfor this ? Just drink it , it 'll calm your nerves . I did warn you . Yes , you did . Was it worth it ? I 'm not sure . He seemed to feel threatened by someone 's presence . But he didn 't say who . No . It means something . Thank you , doctor . You should have someone take a look at those ... Oh yeah , but ... The brandy works better than you thought . Given what we know , the neuro had to get close to Henry Perkins to " infect " him . And we know where Henry 's been for ten years . That should narrow down the list of suspects . These are the staff members on duty that day at the institute . This is a list of patients . This is the visitor 's log . Anybody on those lists have any connection to our other victims ? Of course not . That would be too easy . Then we yank DNA from all of ' em . Over 200 people ? You know how long that would take ? I 'll help with the women . We can rule out the patients . Most of the them are restricted to the grounds . They wouldn 't have had access to the other victims . We should check the staff duty logs . See if anyone was conveniently missing on the days the others were hit . Visitors , too . You gotta tell a fat man to eat ? Riley , go get a coffee . Sure , boss . Vasco ... Uh ? You look like crap . Guess you 're not asking me to the prom . Go home get some sleep . You 're no good to me like this . How am I good to you ? Just go home and get some sleep . Alright . Sleep , I rember that . Something that used to happen somewhere between lying down and getting up . Now when it comes , if it comes , it 's more like Freddie 's nightmare , only without Freddie . It 's just me and my own special demons . Mom ? I miss you . Get back ! Please ... We don 't have anything valuable . Shut up or I 'll blow your damn head off ! No , don 't ! Shut up or I 'll blow your damn head off ! We tried to raise you on your comm all morning . Here , this 'll warm you up . Thanks . Damn neuro got in my head . But unlike the others , you seem to heal quite quickly . How 'd they get in ? Popped your front lock . You need better security . It just doesn 't make sense . I 'd heard someone coming into my apartment . Jane ... What did you have for dinner ? The usual . Salad , some wine , why ? There 's some slow-acting narcotic in your blood stream . No wonder you were acting so strange last night . What do you remember about the nightmare ? Um ... It started with my mother , the funeral . That damn rain hat ... Absolute terror . There was a guy , just like Henry Perkins said . Where was this ? I don 't know . But he had a gun . I knew I had to hide ... Water ! What about water ? Wherever I was ... It was beginning to flood . I had to hide but then I had to get out . There was a window ... That 's what everyone 's been experiencing . They had to get to the window because of the water . They were drowning . Would you stop ! Let me at least pretend to take care of you . Her heart 's racing . Sit down . Probably not a coincidence that the neuro chose the lead agent on his trail as his next victim . Someone we interviewed . Not likely one of it 's victims . The hospital staff . Dr. Lewis . We need to do more cross-checking . Who was at Graymore when Perkins had his breakdown and who wasn 't there when the others were hit . Have Riley run patient histories . See who 's suffering from nightmares involving drowning . I 'll do that . But I want you to follow doctor 's orders . I 'm fine . Doc ... If she gives you any trouble . Shoot her . I can 't place one person in the vicinity of all the victims . We 've got one nurse who was out of town when Alan Sloane flipped out . But she was on duty when Branton and Cho lost it . Looks like dr . Lewis travels a lot . Including the day Perkins did his thing in the cafeteria . I 'm telling you , nobody was in all the right places on the right days . I thought I told you to get some r and r . Hard to r or r when someone 's gotten inside your head . Where are we on the Graymore psych staff ? Nowhere . Our neuro must have tampered with the records to cover his own tracks . Anyway to " untamper " them ? Sorry I asked . Did you give him the lead about the water ? About the drowning nightmare ? Yeah . I 'm working on it . You know how many case histories they 've got at Graymore ? I found this one guy who kept on dreaming that he was one of those , what he called , those prima ballerina . - But his tutu kept on coming up ... - Riley I thought it was interesting . Yeah , I know . Riley , get back to work . Alright , it looks like it 's time for spent on an another visit to " laughing academy . " Hey what 's going on ? Minor security issue . How minor ? Some of the door locks in a wing malfunctioned and the patients got out of their rooms . We 're taking care of it . We need to talk to dr . Lewis . You and everyone else . No one 's seen him since this morning . I have to go . That 's convenient . A security malfunction that keeps everyone busy while dr . Lewis goes AWOL ? The brandy ! It 's a little early for that , Jane . Dr. Lewis gave me that brandy before I went home last night . Seth said someone slipped me a slow-acting narcotic . If Lewis was here this morning , he couldn 't have gotten that far . What 's up ? I need a two hour radius from Graymore . Assume by car . Accounting for average road speeds , traffic density , Homeland Security checkpoints ... There 's your search area . Checkpoints ... It would take forever to go through their logs for the past hour . Lewis is a doctor . He 'd have an emergency pass . And he 'd use it to blow through the checkpoints . Riley ... Flagging it in the logs . Three emergency passes have been used in the past hour . This one 's a block away from the airport . Alright , I gotta roll Check to see if he booked any flight . Thank you . I have looks and brains . All I wanted was relief from a nightmare that never seems to end . By " offloading " it to innocent people . But just enough to give me some peace . When I discovered that I could do that , I never gave the entire nightmare to anyone . Including you . So you 're a good guy . If you knew what i was going through ... Henry Perkins was your first victim ? Yes . You weren 't away at a medical conference ? I had been . When you asked to see the institute records , I altered them to show that I was still absent at the time of Henry 's breakdown . Why Henry ? It wasn 't intentional . He was being transferred to the cafeteria , and he stumbled in the hall . I reached out to steady him . It was a moment of contact ... But I suddenly felt lighter somehow , as if a weight had been lifted . I can 't explain it . It took me a few days to realize what happened to Henry . That brief contact had passed part of my nightmare to him . So why stop with one . Relief from chronic suffering can quickly become addictive . It was cowardly , it was cruel and selfish . I can 't deny that . I need to talk to you . In a moment , Seth . Now . We 've got the wrong guy . Seth , the guy just confessed . And I 've just been over his genetic profile three times . That man is not a neuro . Are you absolutely sure ? There 's no margin for error Sir , there 's always a margin for error . But , in this case , I am sure . Dr. Lewis isn 't a neuro . Riley ! Yo ! New deal . So Lewis , he 's either being controlled by a neuro or he 's protecting the neuro . What was the destination on that airline ticket ? Richmond , Virginia . Plane would 've landed two hours ago . Let 's assume he 's protecting someone , he 's gone a long way to do it . Must be important to him . Lewis ' personal life is a blank . No family , no relatives . Ever get anywhere with that drowning reference ? Yeah , one of the patients . Been there since she was a kid . Seems her nightmares are based on something that actually happened to her and her family . Right , okay . Can you get me a name ? Yeah , one sec . Elyse Danson . She 's missing from the hospital . He was telling the truth . Everything he told us about offloading that nightmare , is the truth , only it wasn 't his , it was Elyse 's . You 're in love with Elyse . I sketched a butterfly this morning . Very nice . Take it . Thank you . And after years of trying to help her , you stumbled across something that did . You think this crap is going to get us anywhere ? Give her a chance . When she made brief contact with Henry that day ... And then I saw Henry reliving Elyse 's nightmare ... I didn 't understand it ... But I know what I saw . You can 't imagine what it was like . To see some relief in her eyes . A brief smile . A respite from the pain . You 've known Elyse since she was a little girl . She came to the institute when she was ... Eight ? Nine years old . What happened ? I still don 't know all of it . The coast guard found her drifting off the coast of Maine , in a life raft she was curled up in the bottom , shivering and alone . She doesn 't remember anything before that . But she dreams about it , doesn 't she ? Horrible dreams that plague her every night and haunt her when she 's awake . But the remarkable thing is how hard she tries to look past her own pain , to sympathize with the other patients , to make them smile even while she 's holding back tears . She can still see beauty through her own darkness . Her gentleness has helped patients in ways all our medications , research and science can 't even begin to reach . If anyone in this world deserves a moment 's peace ... Dr. Lewis , if you feel as strongly as you say you do , the best thing you can do for Elyse is to allow us to bring her here . Why , so you can put one of those things in her head like you did to me ? The chip would only makes a way that she couldn 't pass her nightmare to anybody else . And she 'd continue to suffer . We can eliminate that , too . Is that possible ? No . Maybe you should let her know that . She already does . There is no cure for Elyse 's condition . I 've tried everything . Everything you know . But you see , we have abilities here that are beyond your wildest imagination . I know what you 're trying to do , but I won 't turn Elyse over to you . No , I don 't think you know what I 'm trying to do , I know what they can do here . I 've seen them cure people like Elyse . I know what they 've done for me . You ? How do you think I recovered from the nightmare so quickly ? She only made brief contact with you ... No , no , no , it wasn 't that and you know it . You 'd have me permanently eliminated and I know you tried . It 's me , and it 's what the people here did to me . Oh , God ! Oh , God ! I need some help in here ! How ... ? You tell me . Are you willing to take a chance on a miracle ? Or are you going to keep Elyse on the run for the rest of her life . Let us help her . Damn if she can 't tell a lie . Two ways to get out , one front , one back . If you go charging in , you 'll only scare her . She won 't run if she sees I 'm alone . Please . Elyse has been through so much already . Let me make this easy for her . Cover the back . Alright , you can go alone . Thank you . We don 't have too much time , Elyse . I thought you said we had all the time in the world . Give me your pain , all of it for good . What 's wrong ? This isn 't right . It 's taking too long . I watched you convince that man . He believed everything you said . You sold him on the " miracle cure . " I 'm beginning to wonder if I 'm not the one who got sold . What is that ? Stay quiet . Give it back ! Please ... We don 't have anything valuable . Shut up or I 'll blow your damn head off ! Mommy , mommy ! Daddy ! This isn 't right , let 's go in now ! Pain is pain , what I saw when I went through that door , was as raw as anything I had ever seen before . And never wanted to see again . We have to be quiet . There 's nothing valuable in here ... There 's nothing valuable here ! There 's nothing valuable here ... Do you have any idea what that man just did for you ? That 's dr . Lewis , right ? The nice man from the hospital . So what is so important . I 've been looking deeper into Jane 's DNA if we compare these two samples , here and here . You see the similarity . If you say so . It 's by no means an exact match but the trace markers are evident . And the point is ? The sample on the right was taken from Ruben Hennesey , the telekinetic neuro you apprehended last week . This one is from Jane . It took me a while because I was looking at the wrong cell quadrant . Even then , it 's not an exact match . What 's your conclusion , doctor ? There 's no missing the fact that Jane 's DNA contains very similar indicator points to those we find in neuros . Does she know ? I haven 't told her . Don 't . It 's tough when someone you love hurts , you hear them say , if I could take on your pain , I would . Well , I bet if half of them knew what it felt like , they wouldn 't . Dr. Lewis had the opportunity to do just that , and he took it . Maybe the ultimate expression of love , even if it left him mentally destroyed , I don 't know if I could do that . Then again , before I was pushed out that window , I don 't know if I could take on my boyfriend 's in-grown toenail . You okay ? I 'm better . You look better . Some things never change . That boyfriend 's long gone . Maureen 's still here and I still don 't open up to anyone . Which means , what it always meant , I 'm going to continue suffering internal pain before the truck runs me over .

 Dr. Murphy , report in , please . You 've been descending over 30 minutes . Reaching the mouth of the cavern . Sonar will be up in a minute , then we 'll see just how far down she goes . Lovely . How deep is my father now ? Just about 300 feet , James . I didn 't know the Loch went so deep this close to shore . I swear , we ever do get a peek of old Nessie , she 'll be wearing a knitted turtleneck . The Loch Ness monster doesn 't exist . Sure , well , I guess your dad came back from the US for nothing , didn 't he ? Here comes the echo trace . Seventy-five meters . One-sixty . Three hundred . Four hundred fifty meters . It 's not a cavern . It 's a subterranean passageway . Your father 's going to have a lot of groundbreaking data to take back to America . Go ahead , Dr. Murphy , we read you . It 's ... Can you repeat that ? I said I found a really big egg . All right . Its vertical length is 14.1 decimeters . Look at this , the outer surface has a columnar structure . Aye , and its pore system is prismatic in morphology . Plesiosauria . Okay . Where 's the nearest hospital ? We need to x-ray this ! Well , you don 't seriously think there 's a live embryo inside ? Well , we won 't know until we take a peep , will we ? Well , don 't just stand there , lads , give us a hand . Dad . Good God . Nessie . Stay still . Nobody move . Easy . Pretty scary for something that doesn 't exist , huh , Jimmy ? Man your posts , I 'm going back in ! That might not be such a good idea , Michael . Take this ! No ! No ! James ! Dad ! Sean ? About time . Sean , what on earth are you doing ? You 're destroying your dining table . - Did you bring the news people ? - There are no news people , Sean . You called , you said it was urgent , what 's going on ? I saw it . It was big , it was beautiful and it 's living right here , in our lake . - What is ? - The Loch Ness monster . Okay , maybe it 's not the Loch Ness monster , but it is definitely a member of the plesiosauroidea family . All right , listen to me . Last time you told me that a UFO lobotomized Carmen 's cow . You remember ? It turned out that the cow had an ear infection . Well , I didn 't say that it was lobotomized . I said it was scanned . All right , what are you doing with this carcass ? I 'm gonna lure that sucker out into the open and take his picture . That 's why I told you to bring the media . Where 's your medication ? I saw it and I know where it lives and this time I 'm gonna prove it . Take your pills . Josh and I are going to help you clean up this weekend . And then you and I are going to have a serious talk about your living conditions , okay ? All right , I gotta get back to work . Take care of yourself . That was great ! - Did you guys have fun ? - Yeah , it was awesome . Hey , Josh . Hi , Zoe . - Nice suit . - Thanks . - How have you been ? - Good . - What are you up to ? - Wakeboarding . Chilling , you know . Yeah ? Cool . - Nice boat . - It 's Brody 's . - You should come out with us some time . - Yeah , right . Actually , Riley is too busy to play . Aren 't you , Riley ? Well , you know how it is . Some of us have to actually work for a living . What 's that supposed to mean ? Maybe if you stopped asking your parents for your weekly allowance , you 'd find out . That 's very funny , fish boy . Tell me something , ever wonder why you couldn 't get a grad date ? Brody , don 't . Rumor has it , the girls are afraid of getting shot by your mother . Watch yourself , Brody . Or what , mamma 's boy ? You 'll have me arrested ? Brody , leave him alone . Or maybe you 'll have your crazy uncle and his aliens try to abduct me . Go ahead , hotshot . Take a swing . You 're being juvenile . I 'm leaving . Hey , just a minute , babe , I 'm just gonna buy some bait , okay ? Sorry , Josh , all my bait just made a run for it . Smell you later , fish boy . Moron . Today is Nessie day . Sorry , there 's no smoking in here . How 's the fishing been ? Depends what kind of fish you 're looking to catch . Trout , bass . The catch is down a little , but most people don 't complain . Any accidents reported around the lake lately ? Last month a kid got a fishing hook in the eye . That was exciting . Ouch . - You a reporter ? - Nope . Cryptozoologist . The study of unknown species . That 's cool . Smart kid . No , I just watch a lot of cable TV . What 's your name ? Josh Riley , bait store manager , boat renter and an avid reader of Science Digest . Well , Josh , I 'm gonna need to rent a boat with a guide tomorrow morning . Sure ! - How much ? - Forty an hour , plus gas . That includes gear and bait . - What 's your name , sir ? - James Murphy . Nice . - Hey , Neil . - Josh ! - How 's the bait business ? - Hopping . I 'm figuring it 's time to franchise . You interested ? Hell , I retire next year . Why not ? Beer money 's gonna be in short supply . Where 's my mother ? Handing out tickets to fish offenders ? Actually , she 's just getting back from Uncle Sean 's . Feet off . - How 's he doing ? - Oh , frustrating the hell out of me . Have him move in with us . He can have my room . I 'll take the den . You know , you could just move him closer to town . - Neil , keep your nose out of this . - Yeah . - How 's the bait shop ? - Great . Tomorrow I 'm getting paid $ 40 an hour for taking out my boat . Well , that 's good news . You hear that , Neil ? Sounds like it 's the start of tourist season . Great , I 'll get my rifle . Come on , Nessie . Come to poppa . Say " cheese " ! What the ... Nice , Nessie . Got you ! Help ! Here you go ! Heads up ! Here they come , man . - Guys . - Hey , babe . This is Caroleena , Brody . - Hey . - Hi . And Chad . So , what brings a beautiful girl like you all the way to a small town like Ashburn ? I am here to study English . My mom signed up with a homestay organization , so she 's living with us for a couple of months . So , how is island we go to ? - It 's ... - It 's very private . - Very serene , very romantic . - Yep . Sounds nice . Well , Mother Nature awaits , ladies , so let 's get this show on the road . I 'm out of bug spray , I 'll be right back . Josh , do you have any insect repellent ? - I don 't know what you see in that guy . - Hey , you broke up with me . - I thought it was kind of mutual . - I don 't want to fight with you again , Josh . I just want some bug spray , okay ? It 's on the house . Thanks . - Hey , Zo ? - Yeah . Oh , nothing . Have a good time . Yeah , thanks . Zoe , forgot your keys . - I 'll take those . - No , you won 't . Yes , I will . Give me the keys , bait breath ! - Look at fish boy , he wants to dance . - Brody , stop it ! Brody , stop it ! Am I interrupting something ? Mr. Murphy . My guide 's got some things to load . You mind ? No . Let 's go . - You okay ? - Yeah . Good . We got some lifting to do . About time . - Cigarillo ? - Sure . - Thanks , Mr. Murphy . - You can call me James . Okay . Not much scuba diving around here , huh ? This water has strong wind-driven currents . It 's not ideal for diving . My dad tried renting scuba gear , but it never took off . Cut the engine . See this cave here ? Temperature and current indicate this cave is actually a tunnel . Really ? Where 's it go ? That 's what I 'm going to find out . Out with the tank . As I mentioned , watch the current . It can be pretty strong . Get the flashlight . - Cool , sonar gun , what 's that for ? - Survey the tunnel . What happened ? Fisherman caught some human remains on his line . Karen ... The remains ... It looks like Sean . - Sean ? - I 'm sorry . Oh , my God . - Where 's the rest of him ? - I don 't know . This is all we found . The bottom half 's completely missing . - Let 's get him to the coroner 's . - Yes , ma 'am . Your sonar went off just before you came up . - Must 've picked me up . - Oh . - Find out where the tunnel goes ? - Yeah , goes on forever . And it 's big , 60 feet wide . See you found some limestone down there . Yeah , explains why this lake is perforated with tunnels and caves . Also looks like magnetite . Ever have compass problems around here ? Yeah , Ashburn 's known for it . Yeah , some minerals contain magnetic-type qualities . Also , large deposits of magnetite can screw up compasses . Fish that use magnetic fields for navigation can get disorientated . 40 feet ? Nothing in this lake is that big . Must be a school of bass . Start the engine , kid . Go . - Starboard , 20 degrees . - Why do you want to chase a school of fish ? It 's changing direction . Port , 40 degrees . - Damn , she 's fast . - She ? Port , 30 degrees . - She ? - Hold course . Look , what are we chasing ? Cut the engine . It 's gone ? What was that ? - Unknown species . - Cool . - What kind of species ? - Not sure , unknown . You hungry ? Good steering today , Josh . Very skillful . Thanks . - So , you got any plans for college ? - Not right now . I love it here . It 's beautiful . I don 't ever want to leave the lake . Bright kid like you should be in college . How do your folks feel about that ? My mom 's not too happy about it . She thinks I should be studying now . But if I leave , there 's no one to run the bait shop . What about your father ? My dad died three years ago in a boating accident . Sorry to hear that . Losing a father is a terrible loss . Painful loss . You lost your father ? Yeah , I was 12 . Shut up ! I hate that dog . Hey , Mom . This guy Mr. Murphy I 'm taking around is cool ! Did you know there 's caves in the lake bed ? Josh ... What 's wrong ? Sean . They found him in the water . - Uncle Sean drowned ? - Yeah . I 'm sorry . How did he drown ? You can 't repeat this to anyone , okay ? Not yet . - What ? - He was attacked . We think some sort of predator may have gotten into the lake , but we don 't want to scare anyone until we get test results back . Oh , God . Your poor uncle . Hey , wait a minute , Mom . We picked something up on James ' sonar . Something big , like a ... Sheriff Riley . What ? I 'm on my way . - I gotta go . - What 's wrong ? Some sort of an accident at Neil 's sister 's place . - So , you having fun ? - Yeah , is good . Cool . - Cheers . Salud . - Salud . - I got some flares . - Flares ? - Yeah , they 're kind of like fireworks . - Oh , yes . So , Zoe , how do you like Pike Island ? Love it . It 's so peaceful and quiet here . Maybe not so quiet . Chad , why don 't you take Caroleena for a walk ? Show her the rest of the island . That 's not such a bad idea . - You wanna go check it out ? - That would be nice . Have fun . What could be more romantic than sitting by the fire on a deserted island ? With the girl you love . Here , why don 't you finish this . It 's making me tired . - I 'm tired , too . Let 's go lie down . - Yeah . - What happened , Neil ? - I don 't know . I was stopping by on my way home and I found this mess . - Where 's your sister ? - No sign of her anywhere . Something attacked her at the car . There 's blood all over the place . There 's her purse . What could have done this ? Only one creature I know could do that . Alligator . - An alligator can rip a car door off ? - Yeah . I saw it on the news . Down in Florida they got alligators tearing off car bumpers . Don 't . Brody , stop it ! - What was that noise ? - It was probably just the wind . - Maybe it was a bear . - Zoe , there 's no bears on this island . - Then what could that noise be ? - I don 't know , it 's probably nothing . - That ! What is it ? - Okay , I 'll go check it out . Chad , what are you doing ? You 're making a racket out here . Sorry , dude , I just came to get a six-pack and blanket . I should smack you , man . I was copping a feel off Zoe and you freaking woke her up . - She thought you were a bear . - My bad . Listen , I ... I gotta go . - Mr. Murphy ? You in there ? - Who 's there ? Sheriff Riley , Ashburn County Police . I need to speak with you , sir . My son tells me you two were chasing something in the lake today . Josh didn 't tell me his mom was the town sheriff . So , what were you two chasing , Mr. Murphy ? Didn 't by some remote chance happen to be an alligator ? You can call me James . No , it wasn 't anything so exotic , maybe a school of bass . - Why do you ask ? - You saw Sean ? Sean Riley ? Not yet . No , I haven 't been able to get ahold of him . Unfortunately , he 's dead . Gee , I 'm sorry to hear that . How did he die ? He was possibly killed by something in the lake . Was he bitten ? Is that why you think alligator ? What business did you have with Sean ? - I 'm a cryptozoologist . - You study animals ? Unknown species . Sean had posted on my website a sighting of a plesiosaur . It 's a prehistoric reptile . A prehistoric reptile ? You mean like a dinosaur ? - Like one of these ? - That 's right . Mr. Murphy , my brother-in-law wasn 't the most reliable source . He was in the early stages of dementia . I 'll have to see his remains to help you find out what killed him . Help me find what ? A killer dinosaur ? Come on , Mr. Murphy . Ashburn may be a small town , but that doesn 't make us gullible . I 've seen the horrors of what this creature can do , and I can assure you I 'm not in the early stages of dementia . Oh , and please find yourself a new guide . Josh was close to his uncle and it doesn 't do him any good to hear tall tales about what killed Sean . - Caroleena ? - Caroleena ? Look , I hate to burst everyone 's bubble , but we all saw the blood . There 's no way in hell she could have come this far . - Maybe it wasn 't her blood . - Of course it was ! And if Caroleena did somehow crawl all this way , we would have found a bloody trail by now ! Not to mention that if she was hurt , she 'd try to get back to the campsite , not away from it . She 's here somewhere . I know it ! Caroleena ? Chad , Caroleena is gone and Zoe is seriously losing it . We gotta get back the police and report this . Just get back , okay . Yeah , man , you 're totally right . - Zoe , we 're going back to town ! - I 'm not leaving without Caroleena ! What else can we do ? Are you guys crazy ? We can 't just leave her here ! - Caroleena ! - Zoe , we 're going . Get your hands off me ! Caroleena , where are you ? Caroleena ! What the hell was that ? Sounded like some kind of wounded animal or something . Dude , I bet you that 's what got Caroleena . You guys can stay here if you want . I 'm going back to the boat . Last time I listen to one of your bright ideas , Chad . My idea ? What the hell are you talking about , man ? You 're the one who wanted to come all the way out here just so you can pop Zoe ! - Shut up , Chad ! - Brody , did you really say that ? No , he 's making up crap 'cause he wants me to take the blame for Caroleena disappearing . - What the hell is that thing ? - I don 't know ! - Hey , over here ! - What are you doing ? I 'm trying to distract it ! Do you want to see your friend eaten ? Chad , run ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Brody ! - Zoe , help me ! - Brody ! Brody ! Brody ! Get up . - Hi , James . - Hey , kid . Any other guides around to take me out today ? I thought that I was . I had a request from the town sheriff to find another guide . The town sheriff doesn 't have authority to make that request . - Sure about that ? - Positive . - I got a request of my own , then . - Name it . I noticed you got a police scanner in the shop . I 'd like to have it on the boat today . Sorry to hear about your uncle . That 's gotta be tough . - Neil , do you copy ? - Yeah , Sheriff . Go ahead . I need you to check out something at Bill Maxwell 's place . He says some kind of sea creature 's washed up on his beach . How could it be a sea creature ? Last time I checked , this was a lake . - Do you know where this guy Maxwell lives ? - Yeah , it 's not far from here . Let 's go . Wow , what do you think that is ? Just stay with the boat , kid . I 'll be right back . It 's ... It 's on the beach , here . I 've never seen ... Never seen anything like it . I figured it was some kind of giant water snake , you know ? Oh , God . Cripes ! That smells as bad as it looks . - Let 's go ! - What 's going on ? Let 's go ! Come on , get busy , I 've no time to explain , let 's go ! Maybe it 's some kind of sturgeon . Son of a bitch . That guy just stole the head . Hey , get back here ! - Say again , they took the what ? - The head , they stole the head . Without which I can 't tell what the hell this thing is because the body 's so rotted . The head 's the vital clue to solving this thing . What is that ? This , Josh , is the head of a plesiosaur . How could that be ? Didn 't those things die off millions of years ago ? A few of them survived , hiding in uncharted deep waters . When they spawn , they move from ocean to land-locked lakes using underground passageways . The lakes offer greater protection for their eggs . Wow . See , these pores indicate electroreception . - What 's electroreception ? - Same thing sharks use . They detect electrical stimuli based on muscle contractions of other animals . This one 's just a month old . - Poor thing was only a baby ? - Well , one less creature for me to hunt . Hunt ? You said you were studying them . You never said anything about hunting . Your Uncle Sean reported seeing a plesiosaur much bigger than this one . That 's why I 'm here . Your little lake that you love so dearly is about to become a feeding ground for a race of carnivorous prehistoric reptiles . Is that what you want , kid ? How many of these things are out there ? I had thought initially it was just the one adult loose in the lake , but seeing the young ones means there could be a nest , probably somewhere remote on , like , one of the islands . A friend of mine went camping on Pike Island . You think she 's in danger ? Could be . We need to get back on the water . Don 't move , cowboy ! - Hey , Mom , what are you doing ? - Keep out of this , Josh ! - Go inside ! - No . Why are you arresting him ? - Go inside ! - No , he didn 't do anything wrong ! - Listen to your mom , kid . - Move it , Josh ! Care to tell me what the charges are ? Obstruction , impeding a police investigation , trespassing , tampering with evidence , disobeying my request to stay away from Josh . - I 'm just trying to help you people . - Really ? Is that the head you stole ? Look , Sheriff , you can call in the science community and let them waste weeks trying to figure out how to stop this crisis while more people die , or you can let me stop the killings . Why would I be foolish enough to trust you over experienced professionals ? Because I 've been tracking this creature my entire life . No one knows its weaknesses like I do . You 're not gonna be able to kill an adult with conventional weapons . Get him in the truck . This just came in . Wildlife 's report on Sean 's bite marks . It says , " No match with any known genetic sequence . " Have you ever seen anything like this before ? Yep . I 'm a cryptozoologist , remember ? So what 's the plan ? We 're gonna track her with sonar , bait her out into the open with audio . Music soothes the wild beast , huh ? Or is this thing some sort of party animal ? This audio recording is of the most famous plesiosaur . The Loch Ness monster . Here we go . My father recorded this in ' 76 on the shores of Loch Ness . All right , then what ? You said earlier we couldn 't kill it with conventional weapons . I have several types of weaponry . Military-grade , high-intensity sonar gun . Creates super vibrations capable of tissue shearing , seizures and lung explosions when fired underwater in close proximity to its target . Well , what if you 're not underwater in close proximity to the target ? .338 Magnum hunting rifle . Infrared digital scope . Fires cyanide-tipped cartridges . Cyanide is the only poison that would kill Nessie . But if I can 't get a clear head shot , it 's only gonna slow her down . Well , what if you can 't get a head shot ? - Custom-made Soviet EMP gun . - EMP ? Electromagnetic pulse . This weapon fires electromagnetic waves just like that you find in a household microwave oven . Oh , so we 're not just going to kill the Loch Ness monster , we 're going to cook it ? EMP waves raise body temperature to a lethal level by heating the water in the creature 's cells , thereby killing every cell in its body . If I can hit her with this for 10 seconds , she 'll fry . Zoe ! Brody ! Zoe ! Oh , great ! Damn it ! All right , let 's dance ! Run , Josh ! Run ! Josh ! Josh , run ! Come on ! Follow me ! Josh , follow me ! Up here ! Hurry , come on ! Hurry ! Come on , Zoe . Come on , hurry . Josh ! Come on , give me your hand ! Come on , Riley . Come on , Riley , let 's go . They 're going to wait for us . - Not if we remain still . - What the hell are you talking about , Riley ? Their vision , it 's based on movement . They detect electrical stimuli from the muscle contractions . Don 't move , don 't talk , control your breathing . They 're gone ! - You gotta get us off this damn island . - That 's more difficult than you think . What ? You must have a boat . One of those things pushed it off shore . - I can 't believe this ! - Keep it down . Keep it down ? We 're going to die here , Riley ! I know a place we can be safe . So what exactly is this thing we 're looking for ? A 40-foot plesiosaur . It 's a carnivore . Bone-crushing jaws , razor-sharp teeth . Eat anything smaller than itself . Uses its long neck to capture its prey , can use its tail in a whip-like motion to stun . - Any other questions , Deputy ? - No , I 'm good . I 'm gonna need a moment to get sonar operational . I can 't find Josh . The shop 's closed and his boat 's gone . He said something about being concerned about a friend camping on Pike Island . Then that 's where we 'll start . The Loch Ness monster ? Microwave guns ? Sheriff , this guy doesn 't have both oars in the water . There 's something dangerous in the lake , and if the freaking Department of Wildlife can 't tell us what it is , this guy 's all we got . Okay , but if this goes sour , Ashburn 's probably going to be looking for a new sheriff . Believe me , I know . - I didn 't even know this was here . - It was mined in the ' 60s . I came here with my dad a couple of times , looking for mineral deposits for my rock collection . - Figures you 'd have one of those . - Shut up , Brody . - Freaking leg 's bleeding again . - Here , sit down . Here , let me see this . Looks infected . We have to get you to a hospital . As if that 's going to happen . What makes you think those creatures aren 't going to find us here ? If they really do see with electromagnetic imaging , then the mine should be laced with enough magnetite to dampen their senses . If you see one , just don 't move . I think I should go back to the beach , see if I can find my boat . It has a flare gun kit . Are you crazy , Riley ? I am not leaving here , man . Not with my leg like this . - I 'm going alone . - Josh ... I 'll be fine . You guys are safe here . - Just wait till I get back . - Be careful . Good luck , Riley . I mean it , man . Thanks . - How close are we to this island ? - Few more minutes . What is it ? - Starboard , 10 degrees . - Let it go . Josh is our priority . Look , Sheriff , this could be the only chance we get to put a stop to this . We could lose her . You better know what the hell you 're doing ! She 's changing direction . Port , 40 degrees . She 's close , 40 meters in front of us , 23 meters below . She 's fast . Port , 30 degrees . Hold that . Twenty meters , 18 metres . She 's coming to the surface . - What are you doing ? - Hold course ! She 's coming up . Port , 10 degrees . - She 's coming up ? - I said , port , 10 degrees ! Look ! This monitors her depth . Call it as she surfaces . Sixteen meters ! Fourteen meters ! Twelve meters ! Eight meters ! We 're almost on top of it ! Four meters ! Three meters ! One meter ! What the hell ? - Should I get the rifle out ? - No ! I got her ! That damn water 's hot ! It 's gone ! We got a flare ! It 's Pike Island . It 's Josh ! Josh , are you okay ? I 'm fine . Zoe and Brody are trapped on the island . You should come take a look at this . Looks like we got company . Hurry , Neil . Josh ! Neil ! Thank God . Are you okay ? She 's going deep . Signal 's gone . She disappeared in an underwater cave right below us . Zoe and Brody are trapped on the island and there are baby plesiosaurs . - There 's more of them ? - You 've seen the babies ? Then there is a nest . That 's why she 's been attacking . If we don 't get those kids out of there right now , they 're dead . Riley better get his ass back here soon . - Lf the pansy 's even alive . - He 's alive . I wouldn 't be so sure . - Where are you going ? - Away from you . Zoe , come on . Zoe , come on ! We gotta stick together ! Stupid ! Take this , Josh . Gun , please . I 'm not going back in there without a gun . If we take care of this predator , we do it as a team . Yes , ma 'am . Okay , let 's move . Lead the way , Josh . Zoe ? Zoe ? Zoe . Zoe ? - Zoe , what the hell are you ... - Quiet . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God . Brody . Don 't move . Zoe . Brody , don 't ! Brody ! No ! No ! No ! - No ! - Brody , no ! No ! Zoe , no ! - How long you been hunting these things ? - Since I was a kid . You 've got a hell of a hobby , mister . - Looks big for a newborn . - It 's about a month old . - That thing 's only a month old ? - They mature fast . Let 's keep moving . This is surreal . Living , breathing dinosaurs in Ashburn . It 's her . It 's Nessie . How the hell did the big one get back here ? That pond must be the top of the subterranean tunnel . There 's Zoe . - Oh , my God , is that Brody ? - Sure is . Gross . Why can 't those things see her ? The magnetite in the mine is affecting the plesiosaurs ' vision . That 's not all it 's affecting . I guess we 're back to the " useless firearms . " They 're not going to do anything to stop Nessie . Pump enough lead in those little ones it might be , though . Then let 's get pumping ! Hold it , Neil , I don 't recall you winning any marksman prizes at the county fair . Let 's use your recording to draw them away from her . All right . I 'll bait them to the front of the mine shaft . Should be less interference with my equipment there . Neil and I 'll start picking them off , you guys go in and get Zoe . This is the magnetite , right ? Yep , highly explosive . Then can 't we use it to make the big one 's senses go crazy just like the compass and your guns ? Not bad , kid . Let 's get your girlfriend out of harm 's way first . - What do you want me to do with this ? - Put her down . - All right . You ready , Neil ? - Like shooting fish in a barrel . These aren 't fish . They 're carnivorous prehistoric reptiles . Whatever . Go ahead and flip the switch on that , Neil . It 's working . They 're coming to you . Copy that . We 're ready for them . - Smoke ? - How can you smoke now ? I 've been waiting for this my entire life . She took out my family , now I 'm going to take out hers . Hey , turn the audio off and get out of there right now . The mother 's following the others right to you . - You hear that ? The big one 's coming ! - Yep . It looks like we 're sticking with the plan . Be careful . No heroics . Copy that . No ! Don 't move a muscle . - Sheriff , thank God ! - Come on ! Come on ! Damn it . Piece of junk . Get out of there ! I could definitely take a few days off from the bait shop . You guys okay ? So , what are you going to do now , Mr. Cryptozoologist ? Hunt for Bigfoot ? Nope . Gonna find a nice , quiet little town to settle down in . You mean like Ashburn ? Yep . Let 's get out of here .

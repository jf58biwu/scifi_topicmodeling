 AEON FLUX YEAR 2415 Some call Bregna the perfect society . Some call it the high of human civilization But others know better . The Goodchild built Bregna to ensure us the future . They built the Relical A memorial to remind us what we 've survive . They built walls to protect us . They tell us that outside Nature has retaken the world * . But the real problem is Life within . We are haunted by sorrows we cannot name . people disappear . And our government denies these crimes . The Goodchild regime provides for us As long as we stay quiet . So we tried to freedom . ... for a gilded cage * . But there 're revels who refuse to make that trade We fight over through a government * That silenced us Who fight in the name of the disappeared . They call themselves the Monicans . I ... am one of them . Handler . Aeon . We have an assignment . We want you to sabotage Goodchild 's central surveillance facility . Your entry would be noticed But we were briefly disrupt the entrails * lines Surveillance is their greatest tool against us . as long a Monican can 't be seen we can 't be targeted . We need you to blind them . Each mission bring us closer to defeating the Goodchild regime This is my daughter , have you seen her ? . She just disappeared two months ago . Help me please , miss She disappeared two months ago . Shopping for me , Una ? . Haven 't you heard ? It 's a special occasion .

Now all I have is a mission . Yes ? She wants to see u now . - Handler . - Aeon . We have an assignment . One you 've waiting for Goodchild . We 've intercepted information about allow to penetrate the security We want you to eliminate him . You should have send me in earlier - That would have been suicide . - Not for me Patient Aeon . it 's taking a year to get the information we need I know you wanna do this for Una . But you must remember This is larger than you She 's not the only innocent person Who 's been killed This is our moment . We have never been stronger . People have fight them yes , but ... If we show them the way they were rise behind us * when he 's gone I 'm ready . Tomorrow Goodchild will be preparing his address to the council To reach the government zone , you would need to cross the frontier garden Once you are through the garden you must move quickly to the citadel The inner place has been built to be confusing We 've implanted a route for you . Follow it . I want Sithandra with me for the crossing Of course . Get to the Form . That 's where chairman Goodchild would be - You know what to do from there - Yes . Do this and you would have your revenge . And we all would have our victory . Hello Sithandra . - I still cannot surprise you . - Not yet . How are the modifications ? Useful . You should have it done . I like my shoes . Warning : End of civilian zone Do not proceed . Warning : Do not proceed ... - ready ? - always . Warning : Do not proceed ... - Sithandra ? - Let 's keep moving . - we understand this now ? - Completely . I 'd keep off the grass . * run ouvir 16 / 20 . I 'll be waiting I agree with the policy of targeting Proving Monicans threats But I 'm afraid we 're going too far . We can 't go too far with them . There are advantages to show a degree of leniency We can 't allow in a luxury of hope Nor even one of them . Brute force isn 't the only option It 's an effective one . the Monicans growing strong - Soon force wouldn 't be enough . - So you wanna compromise Negotiate ? . The policy should be reconsidered . - Put to a vote ... - A policy is not up to debate ! I 'm debating it . I 'd encourage to look at this with a little more detraction , Giroux Here we must be impersonal . You wouldn 't want me to take you out personally . Would you ? That is all . Oren . I 'm getting worried about you , Oren These ... you 've taken * . These places like that are helpful to us . I believe in protecting what we 've created I won 't apologize for that This was created to allow me to do my work I Can 't do that if you can 't control yourself - Understood . - Is it ? Yes . - And what about the tests result ? - All negative . I 'm Sorry . Find me a new test group by morning . Maybe it 's time to give up on the tests , Trevor . We 're living the solution , already This is perfection - Why can 't you just embrace it - Do you see what 's happening to people ? - You know how desperate this is becoming . - They can be contained . Controlled . I think you 're forgetting This is all meant to be temporary We 've always said that but , why should it be ? - Because is wrong . - Things change . But I know you won 't . You know me . I 've been your brother a long time . - You 're right about that . - Trevor , your speech . Trevor . Useless . Stay destination . Form . Proceed Form . Proceed left . I know you have fears . We 're all a remain for the people that once covered the Earth . * * We 've survived . Without a doubt We always doubt That 's the fabric of who we are Catherine . It 's you . Catherine . Wait outside . Aeon . - You called me by another name earlier . - I did ? And you let me live . Give me my gun ? I 'll try it again Maybe later . What was that name ? You know me , don 't you ? No . Do you know who you are ? - I know I came here to kill you . - That 's why you 're in a cell ? . But we 're both still alive for a reason . I don 't know why this is . But it 's good to see you . Amateurs . Good boys . - Aeon ? - Little busy Sithandra . Is it done ? I need more time . Handler information may be wrong I don 't understand this , we have to move . I hope that ... Don 't Question me Sithandra . I 'll contact you soon Aeon , you know that it would be consequences of this . I know what I 'm doing . This is hilarious , one Monican eluding all of our defenses . - The problem would be taken care of - The problem is Trevor 's concept of security . He needs to learn to accept more traditional ways of ... He needs to learn to accept our influence Another example that he 's pursuing his own agenda No matter what we think - I 'm beginning to question his agenda . - Meaning ? . A Monican tries to kill him and he lets her live . What an unusual choice . And now she is escaped . Does anyone believes that this is a coincidence ? Do you really think that I 'm a Simpatico here for your complaints about Trevor We don 't have the right to question what he does . You must be concern , Oren . This is hardly a team . I Think I should talk with Trevor . And I think all of you Should be more discreet . Inari ? Image retrieval , dimensioning . What happened ? My sources were clear on this . Aeon Flux is the best on Monicans staff . She failed It 's the first time she has . I wanna this done cleanly . My brother . Would be vulnerable . Preparing his speech . Tomorrow . 1380 . It can 't be traced to you in any case . It 's comfortable . We did everything correctly , she had an opportunity . And she stopped . Why ? - I don 't know . - Image retrieval ... on the way It would be too risky to call another hit . The Monicans may suspect that are been used . Stop . Oren ? Now . That 's impossible . Claudius ... - Why are you still here ? - It 's not as simple as you think . Una is murdered and you keep working for the people who did it ? - What should I be thinking ? - You don 't know . What don 't I know ? They killed her ? - ... and you 're still alive . - You killed , Aeon . They though that she was a Monican That 's why she died Una 's life was worth more than that . She was all I had . You 're not the only one . What are you really doing here , Claudius ? Working . It 's all that it 's left . Working ? For Trevor Goodchild . I blame him too . But now , I don 't think it was Trevor 's fault Trevor 's trying to help . Something is wrong with us , Aeon . With everybody . You have the dreams , Don 't you ? Memories of things that never happened to you Una had them , I have them It 's happening all across Bregna . - What is it ? - I Don 't know . They only tell us what we need to know My work is a small part of a larger experiment Whose experiment ? Trevor 's . We are studying what 's going Outside the wall . Something happened when they cure the industrial disease Something else is bring out in its place . We 're sick . And Trevor is trying to cure us That 's all I know . Trevor tried to * me Tell me what 's in this . It 's a message . Wow , what did it says ? You have to drink it . That 's how it works . I loved her . You know that . Aeon . I 'm sorry for the pain It 's not safe to talk in the open . Nothing is as it seems . You had your chance , Why did you hesitate ? you know where to find me . - Why am I here ? - I needed to see you again . You killed my sister . I didn 't know anything about it . - I 'm sorry . - I 'm not excusing you ... No . This is a war People on outside die . She shouldn 't , she had nothing to do with this . Everyone is involved in this . She wasn 't . I don 't need that to kill you . But it would be easier , Wouldn 't it ? Everything changed when I saw you . I know you and you know me . Why do I know you ? Why ? Why did you come back ? What do you want from me ? What do I want ... ? ... I want my sister back . I want to remember what it feels like to be a person . Aeon . Why do I feel that I know you ? Catherine ... You know me . We want you to eliminate him . Come back . I 'm not who you think I am , Aeon . Something is missing here .

No . ( . ) No permanent damage chairman . She 's escaped . - Why I am not surprised - I found her in the library . - I think I wounded * ... - You attack her ? She is a Monican agent Who tried to kill you I assume that what obvious what I should do . Freya , I want her alive , Do you understand ? Is Oren aware of this ? I can 't find him . Stay close . No matter what Trevor 's done for us in the past It 's not about the proach * . This is treason . * Oren ? Trevor has been moving away from us From a long time . What We 've built here . Is larger than him . I 've never though that we count on this But , we have to face the truth he chose that Monican and he knew what that would mean He must be removed And Oren is next in line . Isn 't that right ? Yes . It 's done then . Mr. Chairman . Trevor has betrayed all of us . He 's a criminal . We 'll treat him as one .

Cloning had never been use on humans successfully But we 've succeed it . Now , when a person dies their DNA is recycled . Oren and I built the Relical to Store the DNA concerned * the cloning process The Keeper finds a suitable couple . And using foods additives , We induce the chemical pregnancy .

Is it something in the came back ? * Yes . I remember . It 's Chaos out there . There 's a group * against Goodchild . Made it easier * To step in . - Did you bring a way to find her ? - As long as you can trace the pill in her . * We can track her . No . Freya . It 's gone . Our cure , I 've found the answer .

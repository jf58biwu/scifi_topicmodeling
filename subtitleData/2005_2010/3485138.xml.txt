 Previously on Dollhouse : She 's a risk . An increasing risk . She had control over the situation . But we can 't control her . No . Stay away from me ! No . No ! please ... the third flower is green . And our sleeper active performed perfectly . I replayed the tap . More than once . It did not lack for poetry . you . I only have a few minutes . They can 't know this body left an engagement . Are we not fighting this time ? I have a message for you from inside the Dollhouse . What ? Sit back and wait some more while they dismantle my life ? I could handcuff you right now and bring the Dollhouse to my door . So , you tell me , who sent you ? You have something we need . I have something you need . And what is that ? I 'm not a client . I don 't need that . You know you do . Caroline ? Save me , Paul . – oh , God . – Oh , my God . Mellie . I guess I took too long getting back . You 're already with A ... her . I know this is confusing for all of us . Don 't stop , Paul . I need you . Paul ! I 'm sorry . I have a thing she needs . She 's not even real ! You feel me . Trust that . I need you to finish what you started . Caroline doesn 't need anything anymore , Paul . She 's dead ! No . Caroline ? Come back . I won 't let anything happen to you . Not again . You let them hurt me , didn 't you ? No . I tried to stop it . How did they know ? I 'm trying to stop everything . How do they know what we shared ? How do they know ? We 're all aware there have been recent problems . We live in a complicated world . But the world of our actives must be one of constant certainty . Did you guys start early ? I-I was , uh , backing up my primary drives to protect them ... from th . Topher points out , we are currently upgrading our electrical and security systems . We will be instituting other changes as well . We have had an active go off mission . Another has developed urges . Others still are showing signs of cognizance or recognition . Nearly all the actives exposed to the N-7316 drug experienced a glitch , a random memory thread . This house is out of balance . For the handlers , the main concern will be identifying behavioral problems that cannot be quelled and reporting them . It 's easy to become attached to your assigned active . In fact , it 's necessary , but don 't think of them as children . Think of them as pets . Is that supposed to be funny ? If your child starts talking for the first time , you feel proud . If your dog does , you freak the hell out . Any developmental progress an active makes is dangerous to the house , and a possible first step toward another alpha . What about the alpha that 's already an alpha ? whereabouts unknown . Let 's stay on topic . Topher ? So I 've scrubbed them as much as I safely can . If we pursued the short-range calcium modulo in K2 amplifier , I could advance the protein 's corrosion of long-term potentiation . Done , whatever that means . Anything else ? The sleep cycle . the sedatives and anti-psychotics we pump into the pods with the O ₂ , the subliminal tone patterns ... I think I could ... play with that cocktail a T. Sleeping is their most vulnerable time . We could test it out on one chamber if you 're stressed about it ... if you start playing with their meds , it could backfire or damage them . Or solve the problem . I know what I 'm doing , doc . So do I. But I also care what you 're doing . To our pets . I will take it into consideration . I need reports at the end of every shift detailing your interactions with the actives : Feelings they express , questions they ask , instincts you observe . Everything . We can 't jump at shadows . I don 't want to report that my active asked for toast and have her sent to the attic . We were hired to protect them . In the field , yes , Mr Langton . In here , we protect the house . A tide is rising . Until we learn how to turn it back , we pile up the sandbags tether . Unless anyone here thinks they 've got a better idea . Caroline , I 'm Paul Ballard . I 'm with the FBI . Your name is Caroline . You don 't know this , but you 're being fooled , used . I will never hurt you . Do you trust me ? Do you want to play the game ? You remember to be very quiet during the game , right ? Caroline , wake up ! help . God . Oh , God . Help me ! Help me , somebody , please ! Help me , somebody ! Somebody get me out of here ! Dollhouse Season02 Episode21 Oh , my God , help me ! Get me out of here ! help ! Help me ! Who 's there ? Who the hell are you ? I woke up in a five-star floor coffin just like you , pal . Help ! Help me ! Let me out ! Let me out ! – Let me out ! – Noise . Not helping . Doesn 't matter . They 're listening . Anyone hear me over here ? Help ! – You okay ? – Who 's listening ? Aliens . Pervs behind glass getting off watching us . Yeah , we 're in outer space , right ? We 're in a nuthouse , more like . What humans you know build circular pod rooms with stone cavities and peeping windows ? Definitely feeling kind of lab-ratty here . I 'm leaving before the electric shock . sorry . It 's a defense mechanism . I 'm just really terrified . anybody else got anything better than aliens ? I 'm serious about lab rats . – Maybe we 're supposed to be here . – What for ? I didn 't do anything . Do you know that ? I don 't remember anything . I mean , I know the days of the week , the capital of Nebraska , but nothing about me . My guess : we 're prisoners of some sort . We need to assess the situation , formulate a strategy ... run . Strategically . Yeah , and when they come in with guns , what do we fight with ? We take the glass shade off the light fixtures , splinter them . Use them as shivs . Deranged millionaire serial killer . That 's what I think . That 's not stupider than aliens ? Hey , watch your mouth . Hey , can we all act like humans and not monkeys ? I know you , don 't I ? How ? I think I have to get to the mountains . Everything 's okay there . I lost something . Maybe it 's here somewhere . They probably want to study our reproductive systems . Sex with aliens ? Come on . Who doesn 't wanna put alien guy back in the box ? What 's behind me ? It 's okay . Just walk towards me . Someone 's out there . A lot of someones . Been very nice nearly knowing you guys . Good luck . Hey , hey , hold up . You need backup . I want to know what they look like . I 'm not sure I do . Hey , we gotta get moving . I don 't wanna leave you behind , please ! – They 're people like us . – But so calm . Maybe they know why we 're here . See ? I think they like it . So do we , like it like them . Got it ? What we don 't want is to get noticed , so ... until we know what 's going on ... good morning , tango . Good morning , Victor . Sierra , Mike . Hi , November , your clothes are in the changing room . How are you , Echo ? Fine , thank you . – That 's not my name . – Not names , codes . Military . Who uses those besides ... are we government prisoners ? Everyone does look peaceful . Maybe something bad happened to us . And they 're helping us heal . Makes sense . Good morning . We 're having banana pancakes for breakfast today . I like pancakes . We 're all gonna die . I like bananas . They 're naturally sweet . They 're high in potassium . So 's the earth 's core . But that 's not food . No , it isn 't , Mike . A food that 's naturally sweet . Apples , cantaloupe , uh , kiwis , mango , mayonnaise . Echo , is there something wrong with your hand ? No , it 's fine . I don 't think so . May I see it ? I 'm going to need to take you to see Dr Saunders now . Hello ? Echo , what 's wrong ? Uh , they made me come see you . About my hand . Oh , no , what happened ? Oh , my God ! Did they do that to you here ? Echo , please , sit . No , I want to know . What the hell happened ? Don 't ... they 're watching . You work for them . Who are they ? Where are we ? Please . I 'm not your friend in here , Echo . I 'm sorry . I can 't help you . I 'm happy ! I 'm happy ! Guys , I 'm relaxed and I 'm happy ! I like banana pancakes . I want to climb the rock wall now ! Isn 't that what you want ? Tell me and I 'll do it ! – Please , help ! – Let me . Help ! Somebody help me ! No ... Mike screwed up . Got noticed . Nothing we could do . He might be okay . The doctor said she 'd help . – She did ? – You told her ? She knows we 're not like the others ? She warned me . About the cameras . Keep walking . Coed showers ? I don 't believe it . But we have to do it . So , no big deal . Okay , new York starting lineup , 1986 , first base : Keith Hernandez ; second base : Wally Backman ; shortstop : Rafael Santana . Keep your eyes right where they are . Mookie Wilson : left field ... third base : Ray Knight ; catcher : Gary Carter : Center field : Lenny Dykstra . Hey , hey , it 's Mike . Hey , pal . You all right ? – Yes , I 'm fine . – Thank God . What happened to you ? I had a treatment . Just a spa thing , nothing bad ? Did you see the doctor ? Dr Saunders ? She 's so nice . I was trying to tell these guys , I think she 's a prisoner , like us . No cameras here . No one 's watching . Mike ? Do you remember me ? Lab rat ? Yes , you 're Echo . We woke up together , trapped . We were scared . I like sleeping in the pods . Where are you going ? I 'm going to swim in the pool . No , Mike , stay with us . We 're all going to leave together now . I do 30 laps every day . It helps me be my best . We lost Mike . We save ourselves and we do it now . I 'm with H. Okay . Yes , Mr Dominic ? I was just informed we have four actives preparing to escape . Right on schedule . Will you at at least allow me to brief the in-house security team ? The entire staff thinks they 're preparing for an exercise two months down the road . They 're not ready . Every person in this house should always be ready . For anything . Echo , Sierra , Victor , and November need real adversaries , real obstacles . Freedom has to be earned . We don 't even have the power to end this . There 's no kill switch ; we can 't shut them down . What if they make it out into the world and decide to shoot up a liquor store and jump off a roof ? Don 't be melodramatic . We could lose them all . And there 's a limit to what I 'll be able to clean up after the fact . I 've made my decision . I forgot where the sauna is . You told me . I like the sauna . Big surprise there . he 's very tired . So , the light at the end of the tunnel was ... another tunnel . No need to be aware of anything but your breath moving through your body . Tango ... would you like your treatment now ? It 's time . Come on . Right here . Did something happen to them ? What 's taking them so long ? They 're just being careful is all . We 'll give them a little bit more time . Why don 't you tell me something about yourself ? I 'm just making small talk . We don 't remember anything , remember ? Sometimes I feel like we ... we do . The yankees . The mets , but whatever . And you . Are you sure ? Can you tell me anything about me ? I just got this feeling in my gut that ... something bad happened to you . Probably the same something bad that happened to all of us . I don 't feel that way about anyone else . Just you . Is there any part of you that ... finds me ... familiar ? – it 's them . – Thank God . Nobody saw us , but who knows what the cameras got . Or who 's watching them . Sophie . You 're off , too ? After a few hours of paperwork to wrap up the client 's file . What kind of engagement were you on ? I can 't believe you are cheating on me with that perfect woman you just met . Now I get everything in the divorce . Easy stuff . Seems tame next to the crap you 've been dealing with . Echo 's all right . They 're just giving her a few days ' downtime . I can use the vacation . Ask me , she 's not gonna last . I haven 't given up on her yet . Look , Boyd , you 're a classy guy , but you really shouldn 't get too attached . It 's like Mr Dominic said . They 're pets . Even a good dog needs to be put down sometimes . Stairwell ends this level . There 's got to be another . What 's wrong ? Look at me ... look . Tell me : what 's wrong ? Keep an eye on the hall . I remember ... men . They had guns . They took me away . I remember the man who put me here . Then , we 'll get him , understand ? I will get him , but you got to be strong for me me now and go with us , so you can help me find him . Still no windows . We got to be underground . We need to find another way . this just keeps getting weirder and weirder . – What is all this for ? – Us . These all say " Echo . " There 's a rack for each of us . Yeah , there is . We can blend in more now . This fits perfectly . Yeah . Maybe these are clothes from our former life . Never mind . Let 's go right now . I thought we were getting changed first . I have a daughter . Katie . Okay . We 'll get you out of here . What 's wrong ? She has a daughter . Please help me find her . I don 't know where she is . someone 's coming . who has the card thingy ? What did you just do ? – Call the elevator . – What if somebody 's in it ? We don 't have a choice , do we ? Go up or go back . Anyone going back ? I can 't believe we made it . Start checking doors ; see if any of them are unlocked . We need to tell someone about what 's happening . Should we call the police , the FBI ? For all we know , this is the FBI . What about everybody inside that needs help ? We do nothing till we understand what this place is and who we can trust . Guys , watch out . when you wear the uniform , you got to push it all down , bury it . It never happened , right ? The good guys lost one today . I had to watch a man die , and I 'm just supposed to make it disappear ? Guys , wait here . Did you hear that ? Someone died . He said he was one of the good guys . But he went in there . How do we know who to trust ? We trust each other . We figure this out together . We start with what we know . You know your name 's not Sierra . And the guy that put you here , what 's his name ? I-I don 't know . No , you do know . What 's his name ? His name ... his name ... his name is Nolan . See ? And you know Katie , your daughter . And you 're gonna think hard and remember where to find her , right ? And I know a mountain house . It 's safe there . I need to go there . Guys , look sharp . Wheels up . look out ! you know I don 't understand when you speak French . Tango ? Let 's get out of here . On your toes , people . We have a black SUV , license plate number 386PCE embarking with the following four actives : Victor , Sierra , November , and Echo . Here we go . Wait . What are you doing ? What 's wrong ? Get back in the car ! I can 't leave . Did you see tango , that sweet girl ? That is not a costume warehouse we just busted out of . That 's a people warehouse . You have to come with us . The army guy they brought back ... they 're doing it both ways . They make people go out and do terrible things , and then bring them back and make them go away . And you 'll be putting yourself back in there . You didn 't fight to get out for nothing . Not nothing . You guys are okay now . I go back in knowing that . This thing — it 's too big . There 's too many of them . They got guns . What do you think you 're gonna do ? Try and make a difference . Echo . What are you doing here ? don 't touch that . It 's okay . I 'm just gonna call Boyd . Rememb Boyd , your handler ? You know him . You trust him . – I said don 't touch it . – Okay . Uh , I 'm a friend of his . Maybe I can help . Do you know what you need ? Give me the key . No one here wants to hurt you , Echo . I don 't want to hurt you . I 'm just gonna tell Boyd you 're here , and he 'll come and take you for your treatment . All right ? you jimmy ? Good day to you , too . Ever seen one of these ? Uh , yeah . Just now , on the counter in front of me . I really hope you don 't want to pretend you don 't butter your bread this way , 'cause I 'm not in a mood that 's gonna care . I 'm just trying to figure out what kind of business you think you got here . Look at it . Look . Any closer , and it will come out of the back of my head . This don 't even exist yet . Meaning what ? Meaning , if me and everyone else I know powwowed , we still wouldn 't figure this out . It 's gorgeous . Can I trace where it was transmitting ? Absolutely . If you were E.T. It inverts the frequency into white noise . The only way you could find it once it hits the universe is to know exactly which speck of dust you 're looking for and tune in on it . What about scrambling it ? Someone put this on you ? Huh ? You 're gonna need an RF detector , smart scrambler , and frequency jammer . And to believe in God , ' cause I don 't care how big you think you are . They 're bigger . Can 't remember which way to go until I see it , but I 'm pretty sure we 're almost there . You 've been saying that for 20 minutes while I 've been circling . I know . I 'm so sorry . – Stop the car . – What ? – I know where Katie is . – You do ? That 's wonderful ! Let me out here . Can I take you there after we deal with this guy Nolan ? She says we 're almost there . I 'm going alone . We can 't just leave you here . Until we figure things out , we should stick together . Help each other . I remember my life . – You 're sure ? – Yes . All right then . It 's why we left . We decide for ourselves now . Good luck . You , too . I hope it 's easy for you to go back home . Whatever it is . Well , let 's get a tail on her . November separated from the group . Is that an active leaving Dr Saunders ' office ? Let 's roll back a minute ago . Oh , my God . She was in the car apparently she 's got one step ahead of us . I should 've seen this coming . This is Caroline . Minus the memories , but it 's her and this is exactly what Caroline would do . Try and take us down by herself . You want me to call it in ? Round her up ? No , there 's no harm in letting this play out . Caroline never was very realistic . Apparently , this is exactly what she was ... – Stop her ? – Immediately , please . This is Mr Dominic . We have a rogue active . Check the power room first . Topher . Status . Hard to see . Some confusion . Are the actives afraid of the dark ? Who knows ? They 've never seen it . We always leave the lights on . Is this that power thing from yesterday or ... – Echo . – Really ? Did she cut the main line or did she go for the ... can you find her ? I 'm looking out the window , but am hindered by a lack of illumination . Just be ready when they bring her in . To do what ? No power , no chair . No wipey . I am , BTW . Am what ? Afraid of the dark . hello ? Echo ? Not anymore . We 're experiencing a temporary interruption in power . We assure you there is no need to worry . Everyone please gather calmly on the main floor . We should probably go downstairs with everybody else ... is that blood ? It 's kinda dark . I was hoping that it was ... tell me what you do to people in here . They come in one way and when they leave , they 're something else . it 's complicated . But ... I use a process of epifluorescent light . Make it simple . Simple , right . I put them in a chair and I program them . You can 't program people . We 're not freakin ' computers . Not that different . Our-our brains are natural motherboards . Everything we think , feel , do : electrical impulses fired by the brain . I just hack the system . What year is this ? 2009 . How long have I been here ? a little while . A day ? A month ? Kind of more . My head . Why I don 't remember things . You 've done it to me . You put me in this ... chair . Where ? show . Don 't tell . Priya . I 'm surprised , uh , and confused . Is this , uh , some kind of frequent buyer reward or ... It 's him . Hey , what 's going on ? A little blackmail , maybe ? I wouldn 't put it past you people . What you did to me putting me in that hell . What did I ever do to you ? You said no . And , uh , nobody ever says no to me . Because I wouldn 't have sex with you , you ... you took away my whole life ? Do you have any idea how much trouble that was ? I mean , all the strings I pulled , and the palms I greased , I could 've bought Pierre island . But owning you is better than real estate . So , uh , you 're not her handler . We got out of that freak show . She 's never going back . Ah , I get it . You kids hopped the fence . It doesn 't matter . You don 't exist anymore . I 'm more of a person than you . Honey , You 're programmed to give me and-and anyone else whatever we want whenever we want it . Which ... you do with pleasure . And sometimes , you even beg . okay . I can afford one hell of a security system , so ... I have one . All right , folks were on their way to grab you up before you hit the elevator , so . – go . – We got to go . You will see me again . Yes , and I look forward to it . this way . It 'll be even better now . You put this in and it makes us ... whatever you want ? Yes . I mean , you have to have power to do that , uh , electricity , which we don 't . So we can 't . You should put that down . This is seriously screwed . What the hell is wrong with you people ? We 're good people . Nice people . We help people become better people by giving them what they need . I don 't usually do the sales pitch . You murder people . You gut them and use no . Their bodies as playthings . Who was I before you killed me ? No , no , no , no , no , no . You are not dead , clearly . You volunteered . – You 're lying . – Okay . You don 't have your memories . I didn 't give them to you so you don 't remember that . In there . Last time you put me in there you made me what ? you as you were when you came here only without memories , which you will get back when your contract is up and you leave here and go and do whatever you want . Grow a belly , sew a quilt , spend that truck of money you made having ... wow , just the time of your life . Yeah , this is fun . Isn 't it ? Why am I not like them , the rest down there — what they 're like when you 're not pimping them out ? We 're running a test on you . I remember a mountain . Somewhere peaceful . Beautiful . I feel happy there . I want to go there . Is that real or is that part of your test ? Real . How come it 's there if you didn 't give it to me ? It 's coming from you . It 's what you need . I have your memories . You can have them back . – You can do that ? – Totally . But I have to go in there . Well , yeah , but ... – okay . – Okay . You first . – Who are they ? – Maybe Nolan 's guys . – What do they want ? – Take us back , probably . Or kill us . that 's the only way out . This way . Hey , it looks like it fits . You can 't imprint on top of a fully functional brain ; it 'll implode . Oh , is that why you keep us so simple ? Yes . Yes . Does it hurt when you do it ? Pain is nothing more than nerves talking to your brain . Look , I 'm just the science guy . Up here looking down on everyone , playing God . I can help you with anything you want . You just have to tell me . I want you to let them go I don 't have that kind of power . what ... No . I 'd pick the chair . It 's just a treatment . God , no , no , no , no , no ! I can 't . I swear I can 't . I can . Stop the imprint , please . my chair ! Did I just kill someone , or should I aim this at her head ? She doesn 't really understand . You wanted to forget . Who are you ? Adelle Dewitt . I am responsible for this facility and everyone in it . Then , you are one sick bitch . I eased your suffering . Is that what you think you 're doing here ? I 'm certain of it . Taking away basic human rights ... free will ... my right to choose , feel , remember . All relinquished by you to our care and discretion . Tell me why I would . I can 't . I 'd be breaking a promise I made to you . All I can say is that ... you couldn 't live with the consequences of your own actions , and you no longer have to . You 're letting us all go . You 're free to leave . Who are you to decide for the others ? Something you should have been asking yourself . I made the same promise to them to protect them from the unbearable truths that brought them here . I won 't return those memories . so , we agree . No one gets in the chair . They 'll be back . Maybe . I 'm sorry . This is all my fault . If you didn 't want to help me , this wouldn 't have happened . Exactly . When we were in that place , when were like what Mike turned into , but the rest of them were empty . I remember you . What ? It 's like I 'm stuck inside my head somewhere , and some part of me sees and feels ... it 's like a bad dream I can 't get out of . I ... I can 't talk . I can 't move . I can 't be stronger than what 's taken me over , but I 'm there . It 's so awful . Somebody hurt you ... like Nolan . I could see it happening . Oh , God , I could see his face , but I couldn 't stop it . I trusted him . Why did I trust him ? – I 'm sorry . – Wait ... wait . You wait for me when we go to bed at night to make sure I 'm okay . What have they done to us ? I don 't know which to hope for . Feels like dying either way . No . We 'll look for each other like we always do . We 'll finish this . We will . You can 't take them outside as they are . They 'll find the stimulation , the conflict entirely overwhelming . They 'll do just fine . Your unbearable truth , lady ... you 're not as important as you think you are . Next one goes where your heart should have been . Now show us out . A tide is rising . And until we learn how to turn it back , we pile up the sandbags together . Unless anyone here thinks they 've got a better idea . We give them what they need . Dr Saunders . Closure . If actives have particularly poignant or reoccurring experiences , these can cause desires — emotional needs — or reactivate old ones that existed before they came here . Open loops . If they were able to close those loops , to get some sense of resolve ... you 're recommending we allow them to take a self-guided journey . Just the priority cases . Let the tide come in . It 's the only way to wash it back out . has the tide turned ? Are they better now ? Each active 's brain was programmed to release a sedative the moment they felt closure . They 're all back with us , so ... I have to assume they 've resolved the issues that caused them to glitch . November needed to grieve for her daughter . I understand that . And Sierra ... she needed to confront the man who took away her power . One of them anyway . As I recall , you confronted the other one . And Echo . She wanted to free us all . What about Victor ? He wasn 't going back to a trauma or need from his past . He had a more present need . He needed to get the girl . He 's in love . When Echo was leading them out , I would like to have seen that . Even if it was all a game . Your game . Do you think I had fun ? I don 't know you very well . You have to look after Echo . I have to look after all of them . She wasn 't leading them to freedom . She was leading them to a world of terror and chaos that would have destroyed them . She 's not leading them anywhere anymore . You should be grateful . Yeah . I 'll work on that . Paul Ballard , this is ... you don 't know me , but I have a file . Yo name is in it , and I think we 've met . – I know it sounds crazy . – Caroline . We 're here , somewhere underground . I 'm trying to get everyone out , but if I can 't , please ... please find us .

THERE 'S NO SIGNS OF CEREBRAL DYSFUNCTIONS , NO SYMPTOMS OF HYPOXIA . AND HER BODY 'S DEHYDRATED . YOU KNOW WHEN A SPIDER SUCKS THE LIQUID OUT OF ITS VICTIMS ? WELL , THIS IS A BIT LIKE THAT , EXCEPT THEY 'VE LEFT HER PARTLY ALIVE . SHE COULDN 'T CRY ABOUT IT EVEN IF SHE WANTED TO , THE POOR KID . SHE 'S GOT NO TEARS . THERE 'S BEEN ANOTHER ONE . WHO 'S SHE ? WE DON 'T KNOW . THE PARAMEDICS FOUND HER . IT FREAKED THEM . SHE WAS LYING IN AN OPEN DOORWAY . LOOKING LIKE THIS . WHERE WAS THIS ? THE CORNER OF HOPE STREET . THE SAME . HEARTBEAT BUT NO BREATH . HER MOUTH 'S BEEN DRAINED OF MOISTURE . THIS MAKES NO SENSE , THEY 'RE ALMOST DEHYDRATED AND POSSIBLY BRAIN DEAD YET SOMEHOW THEY 'RE STILL WITH US . SOME PART OF THEM HAS BEEN TAKEN ELSEWHERE ? THAT 'S IMPOSSIBLE . FOR THE BODY TO BE ALIVE THERE MUST BE A LIFE FORCE SOMEWHERE . YET THEY 'VE SEPARATED IT , STOLEN IT . WHO HAS THE POWER TO DO THAT ? I DON 'T KNOW . BUT WE NEED TO FIND OUT FAST . TWO PEOPLE CHOSEN AT RANDOM . WHO 'S NEXT ? WHATEVER 'S DOING IT HAS THE WHOLE CITY TO CHOOSE FROM . OR THE WORLD .

THEY ONLY PERFORMED IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT . ANYWAY , IT WAS JUST A TALE THAT WAS AROUND AT THAT TIME . A GHOST STORY . THEY CAME FROM OUT OF THE RAIN . THAT 'S HOW PEOPLE DESCRIBED THEM . JACK , WHAT DID THESE NIGHT TRAVELLERS DO ? LEFT A TRAIL OF DAMAGE AND SORROW WHEREVER THEY PERFORMED . TOSH , CAN YOU RUN THIS FRAME BY FRAME ? ER , SURE . WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ? I 'M NOT SURE . BUT SOMETHING 'S WRONG . SOMETHING 'S MISSING . THIS MUST BE BACK , NOW , YEAH ? 80 ODD YEARS . THEN THE TRAVELLING SHOWS FADED AWAY . NO-ONE CAME TO WATCH THEM AND WITHOUT AN AUDIENCE THEY DIED OUT . FORGOTTEN . UNTIL ALL WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THEM BY WERE THESE FILM CLIPS . JACK . THIS FILM . IT 'S NOT THE SAME ONE WE SAW AT THE CINEMA . COURSE IT 'S THE SAME ONE . NO , THINGS ARE DIFFERENT . TOSH ... EASY TO MISS AT FIRST , BUT AFTER WATCHING IT A FEW TIMES I REALISED . JUST THERE . THERE WAS A WOMAN IN FRONT OF THAT WATER TANK . YEAH THERE WAS , IANTO , YOU 'RE RIGHT . THAT 'S RIGHT , I REMEMBER HER . WEARING ALMOST NOTHING . AND THERE WAS A MAN IN LIKE A TOP HAT , A SORT OF MC . YEAH . THAT 'S RIGHT . HE WAS REACHING DOWN TO THE AUDIENCE . ARE YOU SURE YOU BROUGHT THE RIGHT CAN OF FILM BACK ? POSITIVE . SO WHAT ARE WE SAYING ? THAT TWO PEOPLE FROM A PIECE OF FILM HAVE DECIDED TO GO AWOL ? YEAH . LIKE YOU SAID , TRAPPED IN FILM FOREVER . WHEN THEY OPENED THE CINEMA , IT GAVE THEM A CHANCE . WHEN THAT KID RAN THE FILM , HE LET THEM LOOSE . SO THEY 'VE BECOME PHYSICAL ? THEY 'VE ESCAPED THE FILM ? WE NEED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE HAVOC THEY CAUSED IN THE PAST . WE NEED EVIDENCE . POSSIBLE WITNESSES . AFTER ALL THAT TIME IT 'LL BE TRICKY . WHAT , TOWN AND PARISH RECORDS ? SURE , WE CAN DO THAT . HOW FAR BACK DO YOU WANT US TO GO ? AS FAR AS YOU CAN . WE DON 'T SLEEP TILL WE FIND THEM . TOSHIKO , KEEP CHECKING FOR SIGHTINGS . THERE 'S GOT TO BE A WAY OF TRACING THEM . IANTO , WITH ME , I NEED YOUR LOCAL KNOWLEDGE . OH , IS THAT WHAT YOU 'RE CALLING IT THESE DAYS ? SO , TWO PEOPLE WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR YEARS . WHAT KIND OF CREATURES ARE THEY ? NO-ONE EVER KNEW THE NIGHT TRAVELLERS WERE COMING . THEY 'D JUST APPEAR FROM NOWHERE . NOT LIKE THE TEAM I WAS WITH . WE 'D SEND OUT FLYERS , BANG DRUMS , BLOW WHISTLES . OURS WAS A SMALL COMPANY . WORKING THE UK . TRYING TO FIND PAYING CUSTOMERS . I WAS SENT TO INVESTIGATE RUMOURS OF THE NIGHT TRAVELLERS . BY WHO ? LONG STORY . SO I JOINED A TRAVELLING SHOW . I WAS BILLED AS THE MAN WHO COULDN 'T DIE . THE NIGHT TRAVELLERS ALWAYS FOUND AN AUDIENCE . THEY KNEW WHERE TO LOOK . STEP ALONG NOW , LADIES AND GENTLEMEN , COME AND SEE THE SHOW OF A LIFETIME . FILL YOUR EYES WITH THE SPECTACLE OF THE TATTOOED MAN . WITNESS FOR YOURSELF THE SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH OF THE MIGHTY STROMBOLI .

RUNNING THROUGH THE CENTRE OF TOWN ? TYRES SCREECH WHAT IS IT ? I THOUGHT ... I THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING . SAW WHAT ? GHOSTS . DON 'T BE STUPID . SHE SCREAMS SO THE ELECTRO IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT . COULD THE NIGHT TRAVELLERS HAVE PERFORMED THERE ? POSSIBLY . IF CINEMA KILLED THE TRAVELLING SHOW , MAYBE THIS IS THEIR WAY OF FIGHTING BACK . THEIR ONLY CHANCE TO ESCAPE BEFORE EVERY OLD MOVIE THEATRE AND PIECE OF FILM HAS GONE . WHAT BETTER WAY TO GET REVENGE ? THEY WERE LEFT FORGOTTEN , ON PIECES OF FILM . AND NOW THEY 'RE LOOKING FOR A NEW AUDIENCE . WHAT IS IT , TOSH ? SHE WAS PICKING UP THE SEA . IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWN . IT 'S GONE NOW . I WAS GETTING THE SOUND OF WAVES . SEAGULLS .

SHE WAS A STRANGE ONE . WHENEVER ANYTHING , ANY KIND OF ENTERTAINMENT SHOW WAS LAID ON , SHE BECAME SCARED . SHE 'D RUN AWAY AND HIDE . DID SHE SAY WHY ? YES . SHE SAID THEY WERE COMING TO STEAL HER LAST BREATH . POOR LOVE . I THINK WE 'VE JUST FOUND OURSELVES OUR FIRST WITNESS . THEY CAME FROM OUT OF THE RAIN . AT NIGHT . CAME TO THE VILLAGE . HOW OLD WERE YOU AT THE TIME ? OH , JUST A CHILD . FIVE , I THINK , OR SIX . ARE YOU VISITING SOMEONE ? CHRISTINA , WE 'VE COME TO SEE YOU . NO ONE COMES TO SEE ME . YOUR EYES ARE OLDER THAN YOUR FACE . IS THAT A BAD THING ? YES . IT MEANS YOU DON 'T BELONG . IT MEANS YOU 'RE FROM NOWHERE . CHRISTINA , TELL US ABOUT THEM . THE PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT OF THE RAIN . THERE WAS MUSIC . HURDY-GURDY MUSIC . ACROBATS . AND A MAN WITH FIRE IN HIS HANDS . WHO ELSE WAS THERE ? A MAN IN DARK CLOTHES , AND A WOMAN . A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN IN A SILVERY COSTUME . SHE SEEMED TO GLISTEN . THEY TOUCHED YOU , I CAN SENSE IT . THEY TOUCHED YOU AS THEY PASSED YOU BY . TELL US ABOUT THE MAN , CHRISTINA . OH . HE SPOKE TO ME . HE ASKED IF I WOULD LIKE TO JOIN THE TRAVELLING SHOW . HE TOOK A KIND OF FLASK OUT OF HIS POCKET . IT WAS POLISHED LIKE SILVER . I ASKED HIM HIS NAME . OH , I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT . I NEVER SHALL . HE SAID HE WAS THE GHOST MAKER . HE WANTED TO TAKE MY BREATH AND PUT IT IN HIS FLASK . HE SAID I COULD TRAVEL WITH HIS CIRCUS , I WOULD BE IN HIS AUDIENCE FOREVER . I TURNED AND RAN AWAY AS FAST AS I COULD . PEOPLE WENT MISSING FROM THE VILLAGE THAT NIGHT . MY MOTHER , MY FATHER ... HERE WE GO . CHURCH STRETTON , 1901 . PEOPLE WENT MISSING WHEN A TRAVELLING SHOW VISITED THE TOWN , AND THERE WAS ONE EARLIER ON . 1898 , A SMALL VILLAGE CALLED WELLSFIELD . THESE DISAPPEARANCES , THERE 'S A LOT OF OLD WIVES ' TALES ATTACHED TO THEM THROUGH THE YEARS . PEOPLE STILL ALIVE BUT BEEN DEPRIVED OF BREATH , CHILDREN BEING TOLD TO HOLD THEIR BREATH WHILE THE TRAVELLING SHOW PASSES BY . YEAH , THIS LOCAL PAPER , DIDN 'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY . HUNSTANTON CHRONICLE , MARCH 1911 . 'POLICE AND DOCTORS WERE LEFT AMUSED AND BAFFLED WHEN MR ALFRED MACE INSISTED THAT HIS DEAD WIFE COULD BE BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE PROVIDING A CERTAIN FLASK COULD BE FOUND . ' HE RECKONED HIS WIFE 'S LAST BREATH HAD BEEN PUT IN A FLASK . A SILVER FLASK . AND THE LAST BREATH OF EACH VICTIM . SO THAT 'S HOW HE MAKES HIS GHOSTS . SO IF WE FIND THE FLASK ...

BECAME PART OF IT . WHAT IF WE FILMED THEM ? A FILM OF A FILM ? YEAH . THEN THEY 'D BE TRAPPED . IS THIS THING LOADED ? IF THEY WERE TRAPPED ON FILM BEFORE ... THEY CAN BE GOT RID OF IN THE SAME WAY . LET 'S SUPPOSE THEY 'RE MADE OF CAMPHOR AND NITRATE , MADE OF SHADOWS , MADE OF LIGHT . JUST ENOUGH LIGHT . WE FILM THEM . CAPTURE THEM IN THAT ... THEN EXPOSE THE FILM TO AS MUCH LIGHT AS POSSIBLE . OF COURSE . WE 'D BLANK THEM OUT , WE 'D LOSE THEM . LET 'S HOPE SO . JACK ? YEAH ? WE 'RE AT THE ELECTRO . SOMETHING 'S HAPPENING INSIDE .

 Come to my family again and you and I are at war . How soon can we bring him in ? We can 't just pull him off the streets . I 'm sorry , I 'm so sorry , I thought you were Tom . Daddy ! Daddy ! You can be anything you want to be , Mr Hyde . Jekyll and Hyde . The comparison has occurred to me , but this is fiction . Any idea who might be bribing us , Dr Jackman ? Or who might be following you in a black van ? He 's got a knife . Minimum necessary force . You understand me ? OK , OK , a quick half , then . I 've got to go home and change . Unscheduled change , he 's coming . What triggered it this time ? You might at least have had the decency to be having an affair . I 'm not sure how strong he is . Strength isn 't usually a variable . - Sorry ? - In cases like this . There aren 't any cases like this . Good luck , Miss Reimer . Goodnight , Dr Jackman . Who are you ? You know who I am . You brought me here . No I didn 't . Who are you ? We were just talking . That wasn 't me . Who are you ? Ooh , nice . It 's not your usual perfume , there 's another one . Special scent for today , then ? For him ? For me ? The woman sitting opposite you is Katherine Reimer . She 's a psychiatric nurse with experience in related areas . # It 's raining , it 's pouring Jackman is boring # He was talking about me . I 'm Katherine Reimer . - Is he doing you ? - No . - Can I ? - No . - Then what are you for ? - I 'm your new nanny . Oh , Mary Poppins , I love Mary Poppins ! I could eat Mary Poppins ! I 'm here to work for you . For both of you , if you approve . You have a vote too . - What , we 're getting in help now ? - I have references and I can start immediately if that suits . If you have any questions , I 'd be happy to answer them . - Am I interviewing you ? - Yes . - Why do you want this job , Ms Poppins ? - It 's interesting . Clearly unique . It 's an opportunity ... # She 's talking , she 's lying She 's telling a tale and she 's dying # - Why do you say I 'm lying ? - Your heart rate just went up . Pitter , patter , pitter , patter ! I want this job because it 's a unique opportunity . Next question . Why is it unique ? When I spoke to Dr Jackman , I assumed this was a simple case of split personality . But there 's a physical change too , isn 't there ? You 've got darker hair , a different hairline . Your eyes are darker too , very dark . Hard to tell , you 're sitting down but I 'd say you 're , what , a couple of inches taller ? A few pounds lighter too , that 's got to be handy . Oh , and you 've got a slightly different jaw line . Next question . - Why did you lie to me ? - I 'm sorry ? When I asked you why you wanted the job , why did you lie ? I 'm sorry , I didn 't ... Rule one . Don 't ever lie to me ! I can smell lies . Thing is , darling , I don 't care why you want the job , don 't mind if you 've got secrets or if you don 't answer my questions . Don 't answer many questions myself . But don 't don 't ever lie to me . Now . Why do you really want this job ? Don 't open your mouth unless you 're telling me the truth . Good girl . Good girl , Mary Poppins , you 're learning . - Love a girl with secrets . - Next question . - Can you release me from this chair ? - I can . - Will you ? - Do I have a job ? - Release me . - What happens if I do ? - Find out . - Going to need some assurances . The lights and cameras on . You 're safe if the lights are on and Daddy can see me . Look away . Keep going . So here 's the deal . Here 's the " job " . As long as the lights and cameras are on , you 're safe . Lights out you 're dinner . What do you think ? I think you must have quite an appetite . Tee hee hee . Gonna watch telly before I go out . There 's beers in the fridge , bring several . Welcome to the company , Mary Poppins ! How many times ? You feel an unscheduled change coming , you tell me where I am ! Yes , no problem at all . I 'll speak to you later . OK , bye bye . Sir ? She left , sir . Fine , good . Well , um ... can I have the bill , please ? You 've already paid . Yes , yes , of course I have . Ah , you go to the gents , you come back , you 're a changed man . We 've all been there . Right . Happen to know where I parked ? You could have told me I was seeing someone . - Lose your keys again ? - Where does he leave them ? So who is she ? He 's left-handed . Why can 't either of you check the other pocket ? - Who is she ? - I keep your secrets , I keep his too . - I know he sees lots of women . - " Sees " is a nice word . I need to know if he 's got a relationship . - Why is this one a relationship ? - Dinner , no sex . Oh . Have you been drinking ? Don 't tell me you took the car . He drank . He took the car . Why am I getting the look ? - How was your driving ? - Expressive . I gave you a breathalyser . You don 't know where you 've been . - Ta . - It 's enough to have the curse . You don 't need to lose your licence ! - Is this the tea I like ? - It 's the same tea . - Tastes like the other one . - There isn 't another one . I wasn 't due this evening , I owe him the time . He can have it any time , but not tomorrow . I 'll tell him . Can 't believe he 's calling himself Hyde . - He read the book . He liked it . - Liked it ? Read it ? ! Made him laugh . So what 's she like ? Have you met her ? Has he brought her home to Mummy ? That information 's off limits , Dr Jackman . - I 'll listen to the audio logs . - He asked for 3 hours off the recorder . The GPS shows he didn 't change location during that time . All within the terms of your agreement . He 's entitled to a private life . I 'm not allowed to know who I 'm dating ? ! - You didn 't tell him he was married . - I 'M married ! - HE 'S dating someone . - He 's met my wife and kids . I can 't get equal rights with myself ! He saw your family . He 's kept away since . He made a promise and he 's keeping it . Only because I kept him in the chair for a week . He does get angry , doesn 't he ? Yes . You 're safe here , Katherine , the cameras . He 's capable of anything , but only if he thinks he can get away with it . I know what he 's like , Dr Jackman . I 've met him . - Definitely tastes like the other tea . - There 's only one tea . Excuse me . Hello ? No , you 're early , but it 's fine . I told you , there 'll be no after effects , it 's a low dosage . It causes amnesia , he won 't remember a thing since he got back here . Later . It causes amnesia , he won 't remember a thing since he got back here . I still don 't understand why you had to drug him . Because I 've got every key in the flat except one . Still trying to take down the security . It 's like Big Brother in here . He 's got too many safeguards , I 'm cutting the power . - Is that safe ? - Of course it 's not safe . He won 't be under for long , and I don 't know who he 'll be when he wakes up , so no offence ... You win . I believe you . Your letter was in the box . Did you hear me ? I believe you . Hello , Katherine . Mr Hyde ? Jackman 's in bed now . Hyde is awake . And you 're dead now . You knocked him out , didn 't you ? Silly little Katherine , silly little dead girl . When the Doctor is out , I 'm in . Oh , Katherine , alone at last ! Mr Hyde , you don 't play these games , not with me . You 've always had more sense . You know what I 've got now ? You . Ohh ... I 've also got the main fuse . Yep . Took your keys . Yep , took my keys too . Well , lookee here , Katherine ! Everything you need for the perfect night in . A beautiful woman , a locked door and soundproofing . - You won 't hurt me . - I 'll eat you . You know the rules . You hurt me , anyone , he turns himself in ! - You turned off the cameras . - Anything happens to me , you think he won 't know it was you ? - You 're guessing . - I know how he thinks . I am how he thinks . Then you 've got a problem . Because you like me . Bet your life . Are you messing with me ? - Ten . - What ? - Nine . - What is this ? What are you doing ? Eight . Seven . What are you doing ? Six . Five . - No ! - Four . Three . Two ! Come to Daddy ! # She 's running , she 's crying # She 's turned out the lights , she 's dying # No ! If I tell you who I am , you won 't kill me . Are you listening ? If I tell you who I am , and who sent me here , you 'll turn the lights back on , the cameras , you won 't hurt me . Go on , then . Try me . Ask me who sent me here . We need to do this . We need a slam dunk . This is the slam dunk . All respect , but we 're running out of time . Mr Lennox , we have already waited over 100 years . That 's awesome , truly awesome . 100 years , respect ! Love those numbers . But if we don 't move now , we 're gonna lose him . - We 'll be waiting another 100 years . - I 've reviewed your proposal . What if the child dies ? He 's got two kids , he 's got twins . He 's got like a kid and a buffer kid . He 's got a margin-for-error kid . The children are potentially important . Both of them . Hearing that , but we are managing our risks . We are gonna contain and control . And if you can 't ? My neck on the line . My personal neck . Love my neck , won 't let anything happen to it . Contain and control , listen to the neck . What 's the hurry ? Tom Jackman is 41 . Now , I 've got a floor full of people running numbers , telling me shit about genetic damage , about what the change is doing to him . None of them thinks he 'll make 43 . Some of them don 't think he 'll make Wednesday . That , with respect , with all respect , is what the hurry is . We need to do this . You can ... Thank you . Yeah , I appreciate that . Thank you . She said yes . Buy the zoo ! Feeling a bit weird . Don 't really remember getting home last night . He hasn 't been taking drugs again , has he ? Don 't think so . OK . Tell him next time I wake up feeling like this , I 'm peeing in a bottle . Yes , Dr Jackman . - You OK ? - Yeah , sure . - What 's wrong ? - Sorry . Jumpy today . It 's nothing . Time of the month ? Bit rich , coming from the wolf man . - See you later . - See you . Daddy ! Daddy ! Uncle Billy ! - Hello , boys . - Where did Uncle Billy go ? Sorry , no Uncle Billy . He says he 'll come another day . But I saw him , he was sitting right next to you . No , he wasn 't . - I did , I saw him ! - He 's not there , stupid ! - I saw him ! - Come on , boys , in you go . - Tom ! - Peter . What are you doing here ? Oh , you know , I just thought I 'd drop by . - What , socially ? - What 's wrong with that ? You . Heard there was a zoo trip , thought I 'd help look after the boys . That all right ? Extra pair of hands . Didn 't think you 'd mind . Well , that 's all settled then . Come on , you two , let 's get you strapped in . Am I being set up for a man-to-man ? Well , you don 't have them with me any more . Peter at a zoo ? ! He 's wearing a suit . Who wears a suit to the zoo ? Have a good time . Sorry . Rules of estrangement . Do we kiss now ? I 've forgotten . - I 'll have them back by six . - OK , no kissing . Filed . Eddie , be careful . Come on , Harry . Daddy , I want chips . In you go , help Daddy find a table . Eddie , wait for me . Eddie , wipe your nose . - Why ? - It 's running . - But I 'm eating . - And not just food , wipe your nose . Is it always like this ? The ... eating . Sorry . It wasn 't on purpose . No , no , no . Just sharing your food at speed . Will you for God 's sake wipe your nose ? ! What 's wrong ? Eddie , what 's wrong ? - You shouted at him . - No , I didn 't . Of course I didn 't . I didn 't shout at anyone . Are you awake ? - Something wrong ? - No . So , since when have you been an animal lover ? I hunt every summer . That 's not exactly loving them , is it ? That 's more shooting them . Well , it 's a brief relationship . Right , out you come . Harry , you go with Uncle Peter . Eddie , you come with me . Come on , Harry , careful now . Good boy . That 's it . Tom . What 's wrong ? Nothing , probably nothing . Just being paranoid . Right you lot , let 's go to the zoo . What 's paranoid ? When you think everyone 's out to get you . Wolf ! Wolf ... Wolf , wolf ! What 's wrong with it ? The meat wasn 't fresh . There 's really no excuse for that in a zoo . Daddy , Eddie 's nose is running . Eddie , not your jumper , use a tissue . In your pocket there 's a tissue . Which child ? How about the snotty one ? Eddie , use the tissue . If you had to lose a kid , I 'd guess you 'd choose the snotty one . Let 's make this work , people . Our last and best chance for a long time , according to our man on the inside . I 'm on my way , but , listen , I 'm not sure about any of this any more . It 's too late now Katherine . I 'm at the café . It 's like a leaky tap , your nose , do you know that ? It 's like a leaky tap . We 'll to have to send you back to the factory , get it mended . Yeah , the man 'll come and take him away , won 't he , Daddy , to the factory . Now , use the tissue , OK ? Not your coat . But I don 't want to go to the factory ! No , no , you 're not going to the factory . There is no factory . I 'm joking , OK ? Big , silly Daddy joke . All right ? So . You walk out on your wife . Now there 's an Uncle Billy . Good-Iooking young man , I hear . You don 't think ? Claire doesn 't think ? - Claire thinks he 's your relative . - People have relatives . You don 't . You were found at a station at six months old . - I know . - No family , no relatives , you didn 't even have a bloody train ticket . So , who is Uncle Billy ? I 've been your friend for years . More than your friend . - My boss , in fact . - Your benefactor . Got you a job , a life . So I 'm obliged to tell you everything ? No , no , no . I think I 'm obliged to listen . Tom , you have to trust someone . Eddie , stop it . Daddy . Daddy . - Is that yours or mine ? - Is what ? - It 's mine , hang on . - Hello , who is this ? - Dr Jackman , it 's me . - Katherine ? Hyde 's awake . I 'm sorry ? He 's awake , Hyde , in your head right now . What are you talking about ? Can we talk ? Are you alone ? I 'm at the zoo , I 'm with my kids . Go somewhere we can talk . I have to take this call . You 'll keep an eye on the boys ? Sure . - OK . - Are you alone ? I 'm at the zoo . What do you mean , he 's awake ? He can 't be if I am . That 's not what you thought when you shouted at Eddie . You thought it might have been Hyde then , didn 't you ? - How do you know ? - And when you arrived at the house , Eddie thought he saw Hyde in the passenger seat , remember ? Could have been some kind of psychic impression ? Sensitive child ? - Katherine , how do you know about that ? - He 's awake in your head , right now . - He can 't be . - He 's awake . Look at your phone . - My phone ? - Look at it ! It 's not connected . So the question is , Dr Jackman , how can I be phoning you if your phone isn 't connected ? How is that physically possible ? How is that possible , Dr Jackman ? How is that possible ? How is that possible ? How is that possible Daddy ? How can you be phoning me ? Jesus , I 'm not phoning you , I 'm in your head . Keep the phone at your ear , people will think we 're schizo . What , schizo ? Do you think ? I just took a call from my own id ! Wh ... why aren 't you asleep ? There 's something in our bloodstream , keeping me awake . Something new , a drug . - Ooh , tickles . - You can feel your blood ? - You can 't do that ? - Who drugged us ? - That 's not why I called . - You had a reason ? I 'm your dark side , it 's not like we chat . - What was that ? - Pulled it from your memory . - Who are those guys ? - Which guys ? THOSE guys . - How do you do that ? - You can 't do that ? - They 're following me . - Not you . - Eddie ! - Yeah , ' cause remember ... " I don 't want to go to the factory . " " I don 't want to go to the factory . " What is this ? What 's happening ? Daddy ! Daddy ! Stop doing his voice , stop it ! - I have . - Daddy ! Daddy ! - Eddie ? - Daddy , Daddy ! Eddie . Stay there . Don 't move . - Daddy , where are you going ? - My son 's in there . My son 's in there with the lions . We 've got to get him out ! My son 's in there ! Please , you 've got to help me ! I need your help ! My son 's in there ! Wh ? What are you doing ? Who are you ? What do you want ? What do you want ? Me . They want me . OK , take me ! Take him , take Hyde , Just get my son out of there ! - They took the snotty one . - Eddie ! That shows consideration . Eddie ! Eddie ! It 's OK , son . Oh , God ! Eddie ... Daddy ! Daddy ! - He 's gone in . - Has he changed ? I don 't know ! I take responsibility for any mistakes today , which means I fire everybody ! You said this would work ! Has he changed ? - What the hell was that ? - Jesus ! Oh , my God ! Shit ! I 'm going out on a limb here , he 's changed . What 's he doing ? He just threw a lion over a wall . Anything he likes . Give it up for a ballsy song choice . - There 's a note . - What ? On the lion , there 's a note . - Well ... - What ? Get the note from the lion . # ... the lion sleeps tonight # Oh-we-oh-we-oh We-um-um-a-way ... - It 's for you . - What , me ? " Dear Benjamin , meet me in the lions ' den . " He can 't be serious . He sent a note with a dead lion . How much more serious do you get ? " PS Alone . " Well , I 've got several clear lines of sight . I 'll get my best shots on it . Don 't kill him , or me . In that order . Clean up the van . # ... um-um-a-way # In the jungle , the mighty jungle The lion sleeps tonight # In the jungle , the quiet jungle The lion sleeps tonight ... Mr Hyde . # ... Oh-we-oh-we-oh We-um ... # Ever killed anyone Benjamin ? Not personally , I have people . You 're missing out . It 's like sex , only there 's a winner . Thought you might be here somewhere . Come in . You know what , I 'm doing fine just here . You nervous , Benjamin ? Ner ? Not nervous , no , no , I 'm just a little ... lion aware . Not nice to turn down someone 's hospitality , Benjamin . I 've got my pride . - You can control them ? - They 're just lions . Can 't you ? Kid seems a little freaked . Yeah , what can you do ? Somebody tried to feed him to a lion . Yeah , sorry about that . Just an experiment . A what ? We wanted to precipitate the change . As we understand it , placing your child in danger , especially the primal kind of danger , the threat of a savage beast , would create exactly the right chemical conditions to bring us , well , you . Why should I care if the kid 's in danger ? Have you seen his nose ? - Well , you did just save his life . - No ! I killed a lion . There 's a difference . You know what ? You don 't have to care about him . Tom Jackman cares . So you came . So you took over a whole zoo for an experiment ? It 's our zoo . What ? We didn 't have to take it out , it 's ours . - Since when ? - This morning . Tom Jackman bought tickets , we bought the zoo . What , you thought we sent in a SWAT team ? Money is the new war . That 's who you 're talking to . That 's what we can do . Which of your guys put my son in here ? - Why do you want to know ? - I don 't . Tom Jackman does . He 's awake , I can feel him . Tickles . Sorry , I can 't give you that information . OK , the big guy I put through the window . What 's his name ? You mentioned his name ... Christopher ! That 's amazing . What you can do , all of it . Amazing . Look at you ! The most powerful creature on the planet , that 's what I 'm looking at . Fastest , smartest , the best . And you 're British , so it 's even funny . We have waited and you have come . Forty years ago , a baby was left in a railway station , six months old . But we knew who he was , who he had to be . And we have cared for Tom Jackman ever since . More , more than cared , controlled every step of his life , waiting for you to emerge . And here you stand . Mr Hyde , reborn . The second coming , with balls . - Who left me at the station ? - Who knows ? You don 't . We know more about Dr Jekyll 's experiment and your creation than anyone . We can help ... # You don 't know who left me at the station # Let 's find out together . Work with us . What do you say ? - What if I say no ? - People don 't say no to us , Mr Hyde . Not even you . I mean sure you can kill a lion with you bare hands , that 's cool . But when it comes right down to it , we can buy the fucking zoo . Give me an answer , Mr Hyde . We 've got a man down , Med team here now , Mr Lennox is on the roof ... Shit ! That 's not me on the roof . Start up , we 've gotta get out of here ! Sorry , that 's enough zoo for today . My daddy wants a word with you . Wakey-wakey . Dr Jackman ? Who are you ? What 's your name ? Christopher Browning . Christopher Browning . You put my son in a cage with lions , Christopher Browning . Why ? - I was ordered to . - Why ? - To make you change . - Why ? - I don 't know why . - One last chance . Why ? - I don 't know ! - Don 't lie to me . Don 't annoy me . That 's not a good way to go . Heard of good cop , bad cop ? This is the movie ! Look , I 'm nobody , me , I 'm nothing and I don 't know anything , and I 'm not lying . Please don 't let him in here again , eh ? Forget Hyde ! I don 't need Hyde . All I 've got to do , pick up the phone . You tried to kill a child . Do you want to go to prison as a child-killer ? Think about that . That phone there , all I need . - Do you want me to phone the police ? - Yeah . Yeah , go on phone them . I mean , you 've got me , ain 't you . You 've got witnesses . Go on , phone them . Turn me in , please ! Otherwise he 's gonna come back . For God 's sake just phone them ! - Still can 't sleep ? - He 's telling the truth . He 's nothing , just a little man taking orders . So ? They 've got a lot of men like him , so many men are coming for your family . Send them a message . - What message ? - The only message they 'll understand . - " Look what happened to the last one . " - I can 't do that . Of course you can 't . You 're weak . Just be weak a moment longer , - close your eyes and let me fly . - No . I hope you 're strong enough to bury your children . You don 't care about them . I love children , me . Snack-sized people . Always leave you wanting more . I 'll tell you what , you 're the one who doesn 't care , if that man walks out of here . What is that ? Eh ? I mean that phone 's not even connected . What is it ? - Bad news ! - No ... - Hi . - What 's that ? Well , it 's up to you , of course , but I 'd say the front of the queue . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! - You 're still shaking . - I 'm fine . - No , you 're not . - I 'm getting there . - You told him who you worked for ? - I had to . - What did he say ? - He laughed . - Which saved your life . - Yes . - Did you think he wouldn 't attack you ? - We had an understanding . - You do . Keep the lights on . - I thought we had better than that . He 's a wild animal . Never forget what you 're dealing with . - Or you lose a limb . Or your life . - It was your idea . - Not turning off the power . - It was the only ... - Don 't fall in love with Tom Jackman . - I 'm not in love with Dr Jackman . It 's appealing . A man so determined to beat his own demons . But he never can . Hyde is a savage beast , stronger every day . Jackman is a man who wakes up every day wondering what he 's done this time . - Hello ? - Are you with Claire ? Hi . Tom , where are you ? If you 're with Claire , don 't tell her it 's me . Of course I am . Where did you go to ? Guess . How 's Eddie ? Bit confused . He doesn 't seem to remember much . Keeps going on about Uncle Billy . For God 's sake , Tom , what happened ? Can 't get sense out of anyone at the zoo , and then you go and disappear ! - I need to talk to you now . - Where are you ? Sherringham Hospital . Intensive Care , head for the visiting area . - Don 't tell Claire . - I 'm on my way . If you hear anything , anything at all ... You 'll be the first to know . - You were asking about Mr Browning ? - Yes . I 'm afraid you 're going to have to speak to a doctor . He 's here . OK , people , let 's move it ! Let 's everybody not screw up . Sherringham Hospital , what you got ? Who owns that ? Do we own that ? It 's NHS . Speak English ! You were asking about Christopher Browning . I heard you with the nurse . Yes . I 'm a ... I know him . He 's never going to walk again . Or speak , or eat , except through a straw . Blind in both eyes , deaf in both ears . Almost every bone in his body broken . Who does that to a person ? What kind of man ? You 're his mother , aren 't you ? Katherine ? It was in the tea . You drugged me . You 're working for them . No . She 's working for me . I 'm not that poor man 's mother , that 's not why I 'm crying . I 'm yours . There 's a team on the way . We 'll have him here in an hour . - I 'll meet them there . - Good work , Mr Syme . You 're welcome . The order 's in , then ? Oh , he knows we 're coming after him now . We can 't leave him on the loose . No more kids and lions . We 're done being nice . So . You 're my mother . - I 'm the nearest thing you 've got . - What does that mean ? It means I left you in a station forty years ago . With a letter and a photograph . - What about my father ? - He died many years ago . What did he die of ? Was he like me ? Did he have what I have ? Is that what killed him ? In a way . It 's a long story . - Did you tell Hyde ? - I didn 't tell Hyde much of anything . I know what he is . I just wanted to meet both my boys . He wasn 't very interested in me anyway , you know your brother , anything he can 't fuck or eat ... Why did Katherine drug me ? You advertised for someone to work for you . I made sure you found someone you could trust . Once she met you , she didn 't trust me . Wanted proof I was who I said I was . But you keep your secrets so close . Drugging you was the only way she could get to them . We didn 't know there 'd be side effects , I 'm sorry . I think she 's a little bit in love with you , but I 'm sure you know that . I let him loose today . On that man . Hyde whispered in my ear and I let him tear a man apart . That 's how Hyde works . He reduces you , piece by piece , all the easy options . He 's evil , that 's what evil does . The nearest thing I 've got to a mother . - What does that mean ? - It 's complicated . Either you 're my mother , or you 're not . You are a direct descendant of Dr Henry Jekyll of Edinburgh , correct ? - Yes . - Yet Dr Jekyll had no family , correct ? Yes . Then how can anything be simple ? - I need to know where I came from ! - Of course you do . - Are you going to tell me ? - That 's why I 'm here ... Dr Jackman ! - Did you tell anyone where you were ? - No . Well , a friend . - Who ? - Peter Syme . Peter Syme isn 't your friend , he 's your keeper . If they 've decided to pull you in , you 've got to disappear . - Who 's going to pull me in ? - I 'll delay them . - How ? - Don 't go home , don 't contact anyone . Just for God 's sake , please , disappear . How do I control Hyde ? You can 't . - Who are you ? - Official business . - Whose official business ? - Sorry , boys , you 've just missed him . Oh , come on , Mr Syme , you must have seen photographs of me . Have I really aged that much ? Dear God ! - Hello ? - I 've been told there 's no one I can trust , but I 've decided to trust you . Dr Jackman ! There 's a woman called Katherine , she 'll contact you . Help her . Dr Jackman , where are you ? Gone away . That was him ? Phone him back ! I 'm phoning him back . Mrs Jackman ? Good morning . They 'll be down in five minutes . Do you want a coffee or anything ? No coffee . Tell them five minutes will be fine . Then what 's going to happen to me ? The truth , please ? He 'll get stronger , you 'll get weaker . It 's always the same , every Jekyll , every Hyde . - Not this time . I 'll fight him . - You can 't . - I won 't ever stop fighting him . - Then he will kill you . Then I won 't die . How 's Mom this morning ? No trouble . Didn 't even want coffee . - I 'll fight him . - You can 't . - I won 't ever stop fighting him . - Then he will kill you . Then I won 't die . I have a family . I have a wife and children . I won 't die , I don 't have the time ! - Nobody in or out ? ! - Nobody . - But you offered her coffee ? - I used the com . Two minutes ago I spoke to her . She was fine . Then where is she ? Nobody in or out ! One door ! Where is she ? Huh ? Shit ! Tonight is everything this organisation has worked towards ever since it began . Tonight is the culmination of over 100 years of planning . - It 's me . - It 's him . It 's him . Dr Jackman is coming home . Let me dream for you . Get away from me ! I do declare , I 'm all a-flutter . I won 't let you tie me up with Hyde . I know how dangerous he is ! Hyde 's an animal , I 'm dangerous . You 're locking me in with Hyde ? Yes . You wanted to know where your husband goes . This is where he goes . Oh , dear , Mrs Jackman . It 's going to take a bit more than that with me . Fine ! There 's been a murder hasn 't there ? Fantastiche !

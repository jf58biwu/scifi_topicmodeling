 The sun rises on a new dawn . Yet few of us realize the debt we owe to those responsible for this . To those who dwell among us , anonymous , seemingly ordinary , whom destiny brought together to repair , to heal , to save us from ourselves . If evolution can do this for even the smallest of creatures , then why not these human beings ? If someone here ... found out about me , what would happen ? When will they stop ? I don 't know . She 's a shiny new toy , and she 's all mine . And they 're still out there , among us , in the shadows , in the light . We pass them on the street without a glance , never suspecting , never knowing . Do they even know yet ? That they are bound together by a common purpose , a glaring reality , to be extraordinary ? Teleportation , tissue generation ; these are no longer simply theories . I have seen them with my own eyes . And when destiny does anoint them ... my name is hiro nakamura . I 'm from the future . How do they hide from it ? You may feel confined here , but this is far freer a cage than the one they 'd put you in . How long can they dwell in the shadows before either fate or their own flawed humanity draws them out into the light again ? And how will they know what awaits them when it finally does ? Subtitle Added By MohammaD [ shock ] Season 2 , Episode 1 [ Four Months Later ] And not only are these special individuals among us , they bear a curse . A virus which strips them of their powers and leads to their eventual death . In the last few months , I have discovered what I believe to be a plague . A plague which targets only these unique individuals . It 's a disease which threatens to eradicate them all . And in doing so , deprives our species of its evolutionary advancement . Without this advancement , the challenges of the modern world : Global warming , terrorism , diminishing resources , seem almost insurmountable on our thin shoulders . The fate of humanity itself hangs in the balance . But with proper funding and research , we can stop the advancement of this disease . I urge each and every one of you to take up this cause , spread the word , and fight those who would keep the world from the truth . Thank you all for coming . Inspirational lecture , dr . Suresh . I was wondering if I could trouble you for an autograph . Your father would 've been so proud . So would your sister . Who the hell are you and why are you following me ? This isn 't necessary . I 'm nobody . What , you think I didn 't recognize you ? You 've been at three of my lectures . Yeah . The company sent you to bag and tag me ? Is that it ? A year ago , I would 've run , but not anymore ! Well , that 's good , because if you had , I wouldn 't be able to offer you a job . I 've been down that road before . It doesn 't end well . Where will you go , dr . Suresh ? No one even believes they exist . I found your father 's book in the parapsychology section in-between hypnosis and alien abductions . They don 't take you seriously . They all think you 're nuts . But not me . So if you 're really interested in saving the world , the least you can do is let me buy you a drink . Ugh ! all the electives I wanted filled up last semester . Come on . It 's your first day . You should be excited . I am . Well , it 's easy for you to say . You 're not wading into the shark-infested waters of 11th grade . I don 't have one friend . I am shark bait . Oh , you 're gonna do fine . They don 't look any different from the kids in Texas . Okay , except for her . So maybe they 're a little bit more ... sophisticated here , but you 're gonna fit right in . If you say so . Just remember what we talked about . I know . I 'm Claire butler . I won 't slip up . It 's not just the name . It 's everything . Trust me . The company is still out there . And they will find us unless we 're flawless with our plan . From now on ... you have to be entirely un-extraordinary . Right . Don 't stand out in any way . Exactly . Don 't raise your hand in class . And don 't even think about trying out for cheerleading . Oh , come on , dad . That 's all behind me . Just blend in . Be ordinary , right ? You got it . You know , we might want to start by you not driving me to school . It kind of draws attention to me . Ouch . And , you know ... don 't you think it might be easier on all of us if ... I had my own car ? Your mother and I were going to surprise you on your birthday next month . But ... oh , my gosh . The rogue ? Thank you , daddy ! Oh ! It 's yours . You 're the best dad in the world . I know . I know . Claire . It 's just ... I just can 't help thinking about how many times I 've said good-bye to you on the first day of school . I 'm so sorry for everything I 've put you through . Hope you know how much I love you . Sorry . Oh ! I 'm asking one more time . Come out with your hands up . Look , I know this sucks , NYPD showing up at your door like this . I get it . But this is what happens when you take somebody hostage . I just need to make sure everybody gets out of there safely , okay ? Ah ! Both of you , hands up . No , I 'm the hostage ! Shoot her . No , I 'm the hostage ! Shoot her . Shoot him ! I 'm the hostage . I 'm the hostage ! Shoot her ! I 'm the hostage ! No , shoot him ! Shoot him . Shoot her . Shoot her ! Hoot her ! Dude , it 's her . Shoot her . Shoot her . Shoot her ! Shoot her ! Ah ! How did you know ? Okay , guys . Good job . Let 's clean this place up . All guns to the armory . How did you know which one to shoot ? I don 't know . Tone of voice . Eye contact . The hostage looked me in the eye . The other was looking for an exit . Well , most people notice a gun under the bad guy 's shirt . Right . Yeah , that too . Of course . You know , guys who get shot like you did , they just take that worker 's comp and call it a day . I 've been , uh , I 've wanted to be a cop my whole life . Four bullets to the chest aren 't gonna change that . Well , we were gonna drag this out , make you sweat . But I figured , what 's the point ? Take that off . I figured that , uh , you 'd rather have a real one . Well , you gonna take it ? Yeah . Yeah . Thank you . Wow , thank you so much . Turn on your bunsen burners , people , and be careful . You got a death wish ? Uh , you talking about that ? I was just seeing how hot it was . Pretty sure it 's hot . It 's called a " flame . " Yeah . I was just kidding around . Like you were this morning when you stepped in front of my car ? That 's okay . Made my morning interesting . I 'm west . Claire . You 're new , right ? Yeah . So what are you ? Meaning what , exactly ? Meaning are you one of them ... or one of the others ? I 'm not sure I know what you 're getting at . Well , let me break it down for you . Are you a robot or an alien ? 'Cause everyone in the world is one or the other . Robots do what they 're told . Stick with the herd . Aliens , on the other hand , do their own thing . Well , uh , I don 't know . Do I have to choose ? Most people do . So what are you ? Okay , everyone . In the struggle for survival , it is the fittest who win out at the expense of their rivals . Now who said this ? Come on , people . Journey of the beagle . Evolution . Anyone ? Charles Darwin . It 's Charles Darwin . Easy one . You are late . No , I believe I 'm right on time . I believe that your watch is slow . Guess what ? What ? Max Grossman tried to kiss me today . What ? Mr. Parkman ? Yeah . Can I speak you for a minute ? Uh , sure . Can you give us a second ? Sure . Is everything okay ? Yeah , I 'm just a little concerned , that 's all . Molly 's been falling asleep in class the last week or so . And when I asked her about it , she said she 's been having some nightmares . Um , she 's got kind of a big imagination . And I realize that there 's really nothing I can do about them , so I 'm just trying to make her feel as safe as possible . About that , I know it 's not exactly my place , but your situation isn 't the most stable . My situation ? Your injuries . Your divorce . Look , uh , my divorce is my business . And all you really need to know is that molly is loved and well-cared for and she 's doing great . She 's struggling , Mr. Parkman . Why ? Because she 's having a few nightmares ? Because of these . She started drawing them a week or so ago . Every day , they get a little worse . Oh , my god . And I have to ask you , what is this ? It 's in every single picture . Excuse me . What are you doing here , ma ? It 's time to move on , Nathan , he 's dead . You don 't know that . Leave his stuff alone . He 's gonna want it when he gets back . You 're drunk . Thank god your father isn 't here to see you . Or you , for that matter . You killed your brother . Drove Heidi away . Drove your kids away . If you 'd followed our plan ... if you 'd done what you were supposed to do , he would be alive now . To think I almost listened to you . You are evil , ma . Get out . Huh ? Can you excuse me ? You were late . It 's my daughter 's first day of high school . Had to make sure she was okay . And that 's , uh , somehow my problem ? That shipment of toner cartridges came in last night . I know . I was here . And when exactly were they going to get installed ? 'Cause I don 't see anybody else here doing it . I 'm gonna do it this morning . Uh-huh . And if I wasn 't here watching your every move ? You know , you 've been here for a few months , butler . I think it 's time I saw some commitment to excellence from you . When I was assistant manager , we were fully set before the first customer walked through that door . That is how I got this . Paper business is dog eat dog . You gotta live it and breathe it . You gotta want it . Do you want it , butler ? Do you ? Yes , sir . Yeah . Well , we 'll see . The company was formed 30 years ago with a group of like-minded individuals , ordinary men and women who were gifted with extraordinary powers . They wanted to help their own . To find them and to protect them . We find people , and we make sure they don 't become dangerous . Now sometimes that can mean making sure they understand entirely what they 're capable of . And teaching them to use their abilities for the good of mankind . And sometimes it can mean eliminating them . Who the hell are you to judge who lives and who dies ? If I 'm not mistaken , you yourself tried to put a bullet in the brain of a man named sylar . He was a monster . Yes . And you were willing to kill him for the greater good . You acted on a moral imperative to protect your species . It doesn 't matter one way or the other about sylar . He 's no longer a threat . He 's dead . And now you have molly . You and matt Parkman are protecting her . Now we 're not interfering with that arrangement . We have resources to offer you , dr . Suresh . The plague . You talked about the disease which killed your sister , shanti . The virus . Yes . We have the funds you need for your research . Now , can you imagine what would happen if that virus mutated and crossed over into the general population ? Look , the type of research you 're talking about is extremely expensive . Trust me . That won 't be a problem . Let 's just say we have our own private fort knox . So can we count you in ? Thank you . You 're welcome . Dinner ! Uh , shouldn 't I be eating some vegetables every once in awhile ? Well , that is why I got you a vegetable pizza , smarty-pants . Plus I got your favorite rocky road for desert . You 're just trying to bribe me 'cause you never cook . I miss mohinder . He cooks . Hey , I can cook . I just thought why not order pizza ? Give us time to talk . Hmm . Talk about what ? This ? Does that mean you passed your detective 's exam ? With flying colors . Why ? You proud of me ? Mm , depends . Did you cheat ? Why would you ask me that ? Reading the answers out of people 's minds , it 's unfair . No , it is my natural talent . You wouldn 't think a baseball player 's cheating 'cause he 's athletic , would you ? It 's not the same and you know it . No . You know what , I want to talk to you about these drawings that you made at school . You 're changing the subject . Ms. Gerber 's concerned and so am I. You don 't want to talk about your exams , I don 't want to talk about my dreams . Molly . I want to help you . I don 't want you to be ... I said I didn 't want to talk about it ! Can I finish my dinner in my room ? Sure . Go ahead . Claire ! Nice move , ballerina . How 's that floor taste ? Are you okay ? Don 't listen to them . I 'm going to go find the birdie thing . Thank you . No problem . Robot . So I 'm a robot now , huh ? Far as I can tell . Okay . Birdie , please . You don 't even know me . You had the answer today in class , but you didn 't say it . You don 't want people to know that you are smart . You just have me all figured out , huh ? Know a robot when I see one . Hmm . Come on , Martha . It 's just a back flip off the tower . And you know the girls will catch you . Just leave her alone , okay ? Okay , one ... don 't know you . And two ... as captain of the cheerleading squad , it 's totally within my rights to recruit talent where I see it . I think Martha here has what it takes to be a cheerleader . So you can do a back tuck off the tower ? What 's the big deal ? If it 's so easy , why don 't you try it ? In fact , if you can do a back tuck off the tower , Martha here is off the hook . All right . I 'll do it . This should be good . We 're waiting . You 're right . Can 't do it . There 's a shocker . Help ! Help ! Help me ! Help me ! Don 't hurt me . Don 't hurt me . No ! Noooo ! No ! I can see you . Ah ! It 's Okay . It 's Okay . It 's all right . It was just a dream . It was just a dream . Oh , my gosh , can see me . Did you see him ? Huh ? See what he look like ? Okay , you tell me where he is and I will take care of him . No . He 's too dangerous . If I tell you where he is , he 'll kill you too . No . No , no , no . Nobody 's going to kill anyone . I promise . I promise . I 'm right here . Don 't go , please . Why are you still here ? You 're still on your break . Yes , I am . You were supposed to be back on the floor five minutes ago . There 's a line of customers out there . Just finishing my coffee . Uh , no , you 're finished . Get out there . Just a few more sips , that 's all . You look at me when I talk to you . Do you hear me ? Ah ! I hear you all right . Now you hear me . I am done eating your crap . From now on , I will work how and when I feel like it . I will take breaks when I want to . And you will not say a damn word to me ever again . Do you understand ? Yeah . Ow ! Square on that ? Yeah . Yeah . You are English ? Oh , and there 's a surprise . You know , there 's very few locals here with whom I can speak plain . Thank god for you , young man . Eh , sorry . Sorry . So I came over on one of the few trade vessels your emperor let pass . The boat left full of tea , I kept on to find my fortune . You should see what I got paid to fend off those bandits . Kensei takezo does not fight for money . He fights for honor . Really ? Well , as long as it 's honor I can spend . It 's not a bad lot . I mean , I find a stout brute , put him on a horse , put him in a field , and tell him to shout on about how he 's fearsome old kensei . Then I repair to the branch of a tree and start to pick off the black guards one by one . That 's fighting dirty ! That 's fighting smart , sir . What ? I give him a fair wage . If he lives . No . This can 't be . No . I come from the future . Many years from now . Your noble deeds become part of our history . The future ? Yes . That 's a good one . No , it is true . I know what happens to you . As a boy I read the book the trials of takezo kensei . How you killed the black bear of sakashita , your love of the sword smith 's daughter , and you defeat the terrible white bearded warlord and save the village of otsu . Otsu ? You smell smoke ? Let me see it . I do not take death threats idly . Someone 's playing a trick . Are they ? Charles deveaux . Linderman . Your husband . All of them . Dead . Now there are nine . So you think one of us sent these ? Yes . For the pain we cause . The people we have killed . There is no end to our suffering . I sought redemption by helping hiro fulfill his destiny to save the world . How did you help your son ? Angela . I am leaving for Japan tonight . I suggest you disappear as well . Oh , no . I broke history . Villages burn . Those things happen . But not like this ! The future may not exist as I know it . No future . No cars . No ando . No me . Ah . Great Scott . You mustn 't fret everything , my very strange little friend . Here , have some sake . It 'll brighten your day . No , forget sake ! You 're supposed to be a hero . Being a hero never filled anyone 's sack with salt and saffron . It 's a waste of time , huh ? In the stories , you are rewarded with more gold than the emperor . And you took the sword smith 's daughter , the most beautiful woman in all Japan for your princess . Oh ! Ow . Smack ! She 's the sword smith 's daughter ? And I don 't think she wants to be my princess . Wait ! Don 't leave ! No ? No . You have to rescue the swordsmith and make the daughter fall in love with you . Uh-huh . You have to become the legendary Japanese hero that you are destined to be . You have to fight black bear . You have to fight the 11 ... oh ! The only thing I have to do is find me a drink . Come on . 86 straight days of sunshine . You just can 't beat that . Right , lyle ? I don 't know . I guess . So , Claire , lyle was saying that his first day of school was uneventful . How about you ? Anything special happen ? No . No , nothing . I , uh , skated by unnoticed . It was like I wasn 't even there . That 's good , honey . And how about you , sweetheart ? Me ? Anything interesting happen today at copy kingdom ? I , uh , I made a calendar for some grandparents . And a coworker brought in donuts . That 's great . I just think it 's amazing how well we have all adjusted to our new lives here . It 's inspirational , really . The bennets were given lemons and what did we make ? Uh , lemonade ? Exactly . I 'll second that . We 're all flourishing really , all except Mr. Muggles . No one has any idea you won two regional championships , five all-breed rallies . Poor little guy . I mean , how do you go back to the farm after you have seen gay Paris ? N 'est-ce pas ? Mais oui . Thank you . Oh . Must be work . 'Scuse me . 'Scuse me . Well ? They finally took the bait . They caught up with me in Cairo . I 'm in . Good . It 's all falling into place . Just ... just stay careful . Watch your back . And you and I will bring this whole company down . No . Why are you calling me ? I don 't know . I 'm not sure . Well , don 't do it again . I gotta go . No , wait . Listen , I know why you 're doing this . I get it . I miss him too . I just ... I need someone to talk to . I don 't know I can do this anymore . Do what ? Not be who I really am . And I know that I I can 't be who they want me to be . And I just feel like I 'm gonna burst . Look , I know you 're looking for answers . We all are . But trust me , I am not the guy ... to give ' em to you . I 'm sorry . All of them , I never expected it would be you . Hey ! Kaito ! Thud ! What are you trying to do ? Kill the poor bastard ? Sorry . Drag him someplace where he 'll stay dry . And make sure he 's breathing , for the love of Pete . Right you are , boss . We 're looking for 9-1-0-9 . The numbers are on the side here . Supposed to be the third row back . Hey , boss ! Over there ! Hey , I figured I 'd keep a case for myself . What are you gonna do with a dozen ipods ? You can barely use a computer . Ah , what do you know ? What the hell ? Maybe we got the wrong number . No , the number 's right . Something else is wrong . What 'shat ? What the hell are you doing here ? Where are the ipods ? You heard the man . How 'd you get in here ? Maybe this will jog your memory . What the hell was that ? Who the hell are you ? I said , " who are you ? " What 's your name ? I don 't know . I don 't know . Brought To You By MohammaD [ shock Movies ] To Be Continued ...

No , please , uh , don 't involve me in this . Involve you in what ? Who is this guy and why was- - Why was he being chased by those- - I don 't know what they are , But they 're after me now . Uh , he was just a drunk who used to come here And talk lots of crazy talk- - If he 's got himself into some kind of trouble , That 's got nothing to do with me . I have to go . I can 't let them see me with you . Why did he want me to find you ? He must 've had a reason ? He got away . Yes . I didn 't believe him . I didn 't believe . Go out through the back . Uh , please , help me get outta here ! Get up and walk . H-how can I get up ? How can I walk ? How long have I been here ? You know you are six . Please , I 'm nobody .

I don 't want your help , lady- - I want to get the hell outta here . Look , here 's what 's gonna happen- - I 'm gonna fetch you a cold drink And then , someone is gonna take you home . You 're a free man . I 'd like to speak to the American council , please . Look , see how the sun makes it all glow ? Kind of day that makes you glad to be alive . Why are you keepin ' me here ? I see no locked doors . Well , they were after me . Ooo , sounds terribly ominous . Why am I here ? It has nothing to do with me- - any of this . I 've seen you before . Really ? What were you doing in the mountains , six ? I was-I was , uh , lost . I mean , I have no idea how I got here . I- - what did you call me ? This- - look , something 's wrong here . Yes ! You are wrong , six . Do not call me that- - I am not six . Show me your ID papers . Well , I don 't have any papers ... Well , you just put them there . You were seen in the mountains . What have you done with 93 ? I don 't know anything about 93 . Where is the old man ? You can 't do this to me ! I don 't care who you are £ ¬ do you hear me ! Now , I wanna get back to New York . Well , that 's not possible- - There is no New York There 's only the village . Look , we 've been here before . It all feels too familiar £ ¬ I know that . Truly , we live for today . This is my home ? We must be doing something right . No , I mean ... You can 't escape it . - My apartment in - Done in your other life . This is where you belong . We interrupt this programming for the following public- - Will you just , uh , sign this To say that everything 's in order ? I 'm signin ' nothin ' , pal . The palais today identified the missing villager As 93 , a man in his late 70 's , Last seen heading north into the desert two nights ago . 93 is well known to hospital staff Following a history of stage seven mental unwellness . He also suffers from shortness of breath , Dizzy spells and a weak heart . But we wish him well And hope to report his discovery eminently ... If not sooner . What can I do you for ? I 'd like to buy a map . Hmm ... street or topographic ? Biggest one you got . That 's the biggest ? Pull her out . That 's it ! Buy one , get one free . What the hell would I want with two maps ? Makes a perfect gift . Big enough for ya ? Here we are ... You are here . That 's the palais two . " wow " being the appropriate word . And that 's the clinic and- - Where 's the road outta here ? Ohh- - you crack me up , six . You 've not seen me before . No , sir . You , I would remember . - But you know my - welcome to the village . Everybody knows everybody ! Be seein ' ya ! Six ! Six , wait ! Why are you calling me that ? Well , I think that it suits you . Six ... hmm , I like it . - Six , where do you think you 're going ? - Goin ' home . You won 't get far . Is there nothing I can say will make you wait . You can tell me the truth . What the hell is this place ? You 're one of us . That 's the truth . Wha- - hey ! Aw , man , not my car- - come on ! Do you think I could use your phone ? Mine 's just been stolen . Yeah . Go ahead . Actually , I lied . I lost it . I 'm always losing my phone . I hate leaving messages- - don 't you ? I noticed you , ' cause you look like You 're waiting for someone . Maybe , I am . Who you waitin ' for ? Don 't answer that . I 'm late ... again . Traffic the same on the G.W. as the Jersey turnpike . It 's hell on four wheels out there . So , if you want my advice- - get off your butt and walk ! Total gridlock from some kind of gas explosion In the heart of Brooklyn . Hey ! You got my phone . Um , I 'd say , " sorry " but I promised myself I 'd stop apologizing to men . - Having a party ? - Yeah , you wanna come ? Can 't make it tonight . There 's no party , anyway . Ah , just what I thought ... " drinking alone . " I 'm celebrating . Oh , yeah- - what ? Ah ... escape You were talking to someone . You shouldn 't listen to other people 's conversations . It 's rude . How come you 're interested in my life back there , If it doesn 't exist ? Of course , I 'm interested . I want to help you with these delusions . I can 't leave here , can I ? Why would you want to leave ? Why would you even think such a thing ? All right , doctor . My delusion is , I met a woman the other night ... And I invited her back to my apartment . Did she come back ... To your apartment ? I don 't know . I don 't know . - What 's that ? - I haven 't opened it , yet . It 's from the clinic . What 's it say ? We 've been summoned , to the clinic . What for ? An appointment , with two . Oh , dear ! It says someone else here at the bottom . So , this guy at the hospital . He wants to know where 93 's body is . Why ? That 's not a delusion . That 's happening here , right now . If you did see 93 . Is that why they set me free , To let you loose on me ? The caring , sharing doctor , With the big beautiful eyes and the nice , girly smile . Soften me up- - get me to talk ? Of course , you doubt me . You doubt everything , But that 's not you speaking , six . That 's your condition . My condition is that I 'm being held here against my will . Cabins 29 to 63 . Yellow district- - cabins 309 to 357 . Green district- - apartments 51 to 299 . Can you see , six , How I might wonder why you are here , If , as you claim , " you know nothing about 93 ? " I came here to find out who this man , 93 , is . Now that you 're here ... Do you see what he was ? A drunk . A fool . Maybe he drank , Because he found the lie of this place unbearable . He knew what I know . The village is not all that there is . What is it you 're suggesting ? A hole in the sky , Aliens landing secretly in the night , Mysterious roads that lead beyond , beyond , beyond . A magic gateway , perhaps ? Some portal leading into " never-never land . " Take a look outside , six . People going about their lives , Strolling in the sun , Sitting together in the park , Or anywhere where they might choose to sit together . They take a scooter ride , go dancing , Enjoy a beer in the cafe , While they gaze about the village . Contented . Hopeful . Every day above ground is a good day . The problem ... is in your mind . Well ... I want out . You 've tried that ! There is no " out . " There is only " in . " Now , you can go on tormenting yourself , If that 's what you want , Or you can stop . If 93 were no more than a drunk , A fool , as you say , Then why were they chasing after him ? Shooting at him ? Because 93 found something , And if he can do it , I can . I pity you , six . You refuse to open your mind to the possibility That you 're wrong . If I open my mind , You 'll take it away from me . We might ... But we will always give it back . Did 93 show you this- - I need to know . Did he talk to you about this ? Are there other drawings ? 554 , please . 93 must 've trusted you . There has to be a reason he told me to come to you . What is this- - what does this do ? I 'm going to meet my boyfriend . I 'm sorry . Please , help me . Please . 93 said , " the drawings were from his other life ... " before the village . " That 's all I know . You have to leave me alone , now . And you are here to receive a medal For services to the village , And you should keep the medal with you , At all times . And when you met number six , What did you make of him ? He was a little strange . A-a-actually- - nope . Number six has been dealt with , So he is no longer a worry to us . And there was another thing , in the summons . Uh , yeah , it said , uh , " to bring cake , with cherries in it . " Did you ? Uh , yeah- - yeah . Oh , no- - leave it there . " my dear villagers , Perhaps two could interrupt your day in the sun To relate the grave news He spoke briefly to emergency staff , Before dying on route to the hospital . His last words were to honor the village , And request the anthem be sung in his name . If you tell me what you know , I promise you , I won 't come back . Breathe in , breath out ... Village life goes on . Do you want , uh , something to drink ? 93 was convinced that his dreams meant That he had another life , before this one . He started saying things ... That we 're prisoners here . Prisoners ? I 've said too much . I don 't even know who you are . It 's okay ... you can trust me . I am not one of them . I dream this , all the time . What is it ? This is more real , than anything out there . This is the first bit of hope I 've been given , Since I got here . If there are others like us , who dream , And they got to thinking that 93 escaped , - Then ... - Do you think there are others ? Do you ? Are you for real ? I promise you ... you 're safe with me . I 'll see you at the cafe tomorrow . What is it , 11-12 ? Why is six so convinced there is another place ? Because for people like six , life is not enough . The simple life ... They want to escape it . What are you doing here ? Oh , I 'm trying to find out what you 're doin ' here . Do something for me , will ya ? Lie down beside me . Uh , you 're supposed to be trying To convince me you 're sane . Come on . Uh , okay . Right . A hundred billion stars , Over and over billions of galaxies , And that 's just what we can see . Can you honestly tell me That the village is all that there is ? Of course not . Has to be life out there somewhere . Perhaps , another village . Oh , it 's , um , 400 billion , by the way . Look at me . Isaac Newton , Galileo , Plato , Socrates , Karl Marx , Groucho Marx , Darwin ... surely , Darwin . Kennedy , Bob Dylan , David Beckam . Who invented the telephone ? Alexander Graham Bell ... The light bulb ? 512 . Everyone says it was Thomas Edison . It was Joseph Swan . Where do these names come from- - these memories ? I was taught this stuff by a lady named Mrs.Radcliff , My teacher . Now , where does that come from ? Now , tell me about Mrs. Radcliff . - You 're humoring me . - Tell me , anyway . Okay , she had a big blue nose , Skin like a crocodile . She actually looked more like a man in a dress . Not just a man , but a boxer . Wow ! I like her , already . Do you know what a crocodile is ? Are you trying to trap me ? Yes- - no . Yes . Are you trying to trap me ? Yes-yes No . Tell me about the woman . I resigned today . Oh , that 's why you 're celebrating . Alone . Too bad . Um , I go this way . Really ? Really . Uh , what 's your name ? Lucy . Lucy . Well , I 'd like to get to know you , Lucy . Well , maybe you can . Well , I 'd like to get to know you , tonight . Well , maybe you can . Maybe , you can . What 's goin ' on ? You know what it is , six . 93 deserves a decent burial . You didn 't find his body . 93 is gone- - escaped . Found the way out . If 93 found the way out , Six can convince himself that there is an out . Six must try to escape , because six knows , There is nothing to escape from . In his mind , in is soul , Six knows that six is six . Hey , man- - need a cab ? Why would I need a cab , if I 'm going into a cafe ? Well , you know , people who go into cafes , Come outta cafes , And sometimes , they might need a cab . Well , I don 't know , if I 'll need a cab . - Why you hassling me , anyway ? - Hey , six ... I like you- - you 're a likable man . And I like giving rides in my cab to people I like . Sometimes , being nice is , uh , Well , it 's just being nice . Hey . I 'll always be here , if you need me . Thanks . If you 're crawling through traffic , Hoping to escape for the weekend , Think hard , my friends . - Did you hear that ? - It 's the same on the G.W.- - It 's hell on four wheels out there . Oh , gridlock , after some kind of gas explosion , In the heart of Brooklyn . Put a pillow on his face . Snuffed him out like a- - Snuffed him out like a candle . Now-now , he 's dead . Need some help here ! I 'm glad I met you , six . I 'm glad I told you . Perhaps , we can escape together . When you 're better . 93 said- - he said ... " Follow the towers . " Please , back away , sir- - please , back away . Keep calm , now . What is it- - terrorists ? Some kind of resistance ? Tell me You should 've stayed away from her . So , what are you saying ? Are you saying , " this is my fault ? " - Look- - - No , you tell me , damn it ! Don 't you see- - What 's the matter with you ? With every pore of my body , I 'm scared . Look , um ... Sometimes , not very often , something like this happens . And everything goes back to normal . Things , they settle down . They do it for us . Just , please , don 't make things worse , six . " I promise you , you 're safe with me . " Two ! Do you hear me ? She 's gone- - you did that . She knew there was a way outta here ! And I 'm gonna find it ! I will find a way to escape ! Do you hear me ? I am not a number ! I 'm a free man !

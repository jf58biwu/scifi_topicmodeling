my head is clear now. i understand . the only way out of this is for me to confess . fine . i 'll start the paperwork . if they keep digging , they will find out about all of us and what we can do . let it go . let it go . what 's that ? parental release form to try out for the cheerleading squad . for me ? yep . i 'm flattered . i don 't think i can squeeze cheerleading into my schedule . but you 're kind of a hero to the girls in the squad . a hero ? why ? the way you stood up to debbie on youfirst day . you know , half of being a cheerleader is having guts . and you have got those in spades . i 'll tell you what . i 'll think about it , and then i 'll let you know if i change my mind . good ! then take the release form just in case . hi . hi . i can 't stop thinking about yesterday . itas so amazing . i finally haveomeone i can be myself with . uh , about that . i--i 'm not sure we should hang out anymore . it 's just my parents are really overprotective . is this because we flew together ?

please don 't make this harder on me than it already is . okay. i 'll tell you what . tomorrow i 'll totally back off . today , i 'm asking you out . west- - tonight , anywhere you want to go . if you want to call it off after that , fine . fine , but just this once . you won 't regret it . what do you think you 're doing questioning a suspect in a hospital ? any confession is coerced. she 's sick . coerced or not , they believe her . but i know she 's innocent . how ? the same way i know that you can fly . i can read your mind . just like i read your mother 's . but i can 't tell my partner what i know or how i know it . you reading my mind right now ?

because you were right , nathan . i don 't deserve to be saved . ma , i was angry when i said that . i was drunk. i didn 't mean it . of course you did . you asked me for help once. now just let me help you . just because you shaved doesn 't mean you 're clean and sober . you still have to get yourself into a program . get your family back . don 't let your children hate you . not if you can help it . you didn 't kill kaito nakamura . i know that . i have done so many bad things in my life it really doesn 't matter what crime i confess to . let me help you , ma . no , what you want is redemption , and you 're not gonna get it by helping me . you 'll just get killed . and i can 't bear to lose another son . he has to do this. i 'm sorry . it 's all right. i 'm , i 'm ready . where 's your stuff ?

and you should be happy you have one . there 's a lot of people in this city who don 't . i thought for dessert we could go to that adorable yogurt place near the bus depot . i can 't . i have to go to the liary for a research paper . the library ? haven 't you ever heard of the internet ? actually , the research paper is on libraries and how during the digital age they 're becoming increasingly obsolete for our generation . do you need a lift ? what ? your car ? it got stolen , remember ? so do you ? that 's okay . i think i 'm just gonna walk . okay . hi . hi . photo 's gotta be in here somewhere . it 's a group shot . maybe 10 , 12 people . what kind of group is it ? it was a party or a meeting . my parents are in it. kaito nakamura . you knew nakamura ? no , my folks did . he used to come over the house sometimes . my father didn 't seem to care for him too much . i remember the last time i saw him , my mom hugged him , and it lasted just a little bit too long . what about the others in the group ? linderman was in it . charles deveaux too . a lot of them are dead now . these your boys ? yeah . what , you don 't see ' em that often ? look , i don 't- - i 'm sorry , i don 't really know you that well . my wife--my ex-wife , uh , cheated on me . which i could 've forgiven her for , except for the fact that she was pregnant with his baby . why are you telling me all this ? i just--i know a bunch of stuff about you . i figure it 's only fair . if you want to unload , go ahead . six months ago , i was a cop in l.a. married , expecting a child , and then all of a sudden this stuff started happening . it just turned everything upsiddown . i 'm just looking for answers . maybe this 'll help . that 's the same photo . half the people in this picture are dead . it 's the like killer 's picking ' em off one by one . maybe one of these is the killer . look , here 's my father , here 's my mother . charles deveaux. linderman . kaito nakamura. this guy 's name is bob . bob ... i don 't know his last name . i don 't know the rest of the people in the picture either . i know him . how ?

you lost more than most in the storm , and that kind of loss , it takes a while . you shouldn 't be in such a hurry . i don 't know . maybe god 's punishing me . now why would he do that ? for being selfish . i pray for it every sunday in church . for god to find me a way out of here . everybody else is praying for the community . to put things back together , to give them strength . not me . i 'm just praying for a way out . th 's terrible , isn 't it ? monica , given the situation , i 'd say it 's pretty normal . normal . yeah , that 's me all right . i offer to take you anywhere , and this is all you can come up with ? well , what can i say ? i 'm a cheap date . you got a thing for heights , huh ? there was this place near where i used to live in texas . it was this old gravel tower . i used to climb up to the top of it . see what i could do . you 'd jump off ? yeah . guess i 've just been thinking a lot about my life . how it all went away so fast . why did it go away ? i can 't tell you that . the truth is so many terrible things happened to me while i lived there ... i 'm not sure i could ever open up to anyone again . well , we 're here together . so part of you must want to share something . i want to trust you . then jump . what ? trust begins with a leap. oh ! cheesy , but true . oh , no , it 'll be gross . my arms pop out of their sockets and sometimes my feet come out facing each other . it 's not cute . claire , these fears you have of someone finding out about you , of feeling different forever , i have them too . you can share them with me , but i can 't help you if you don 't trust me . okay . you caught me . of course i did . but i would 've been fine . i know you can heal , claire . but i never want to see you hurt . i don 't understand . you don 't even have tools . just hold on. almost got it . you know if this doesn 't work , you 're dd . you know that , right ? wow , you did it ! all right , you got your stay of execution . is that pay-per-view ? uh-huh . how did you get that ? turns out micah 's some type of genius and rigged the cable . is that true ? yeah. i 'm sorry . i was just trying to help . look , i know it 's tough being stuck with your cousins like this after everything you 've been through . but i promised your mother that i 'd look after you . so you gotta obey the rules around here , okay ?

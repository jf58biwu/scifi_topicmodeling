 Pain 's A Bitch ! [ Siren Wailing ] Security Breach ! [ Siren Wailing ] Sl [ Siren Wailing ] Zero Response ! Stop ! Now ! I Got Him ! [ Gunfire ] Stop ! [ Gunfire ] Where Is He ? Nobody Could Have Survived That ! He 's Gone ! Attention All Units , Target Is Mia . And I Want That New Thing With The Grilled Chicken I 'm Not Convinced That We 're Brought Up To Deal With Our Problems . Mostly , We Just Distract Ourselves When Something Tough Comes Up . We Learn That Early . I Barely Saw My Father While My Mother Was Alive . After She Was Gone , He Took Me To The Movies , The Circus , Ball Games , Distractions . As A Kid , You 'd Always Be Given Something Good To Help You Deal With Something Bad . Go To The Doctor , Here 's A Balloon . Fall Down And Scrape Your Knee , Have A Cookie . If You Cry Hard Enough You Might Even Get Two . And When You 're Grown Up It Get 's Even Better You Get To Eat The Whole Bag . - -This Is A Cross-Section , Midgenome . This Haplotype Goes Beyond The Mitochondrial Inceptors ... Seth Is Our Medical Expert , Cute But Not My Type . Definitely Not The Cookie And Balloon Type . I Have A Feeling His Idea Of A Treat Would Make Most Kids Cry For Mommy . I 've Noticed Some Remarkable Differences ... Are You Listening To Me ? Yeah , Yeah , Hanging On Every Loci . Right . At This Moment , I Wish I Was Hanging . From A Rafter . Only Given My Condition Not Much Of An Option . What I Really Could Go For Right Now , Major Distractions . Like Tequila Shots And A Weekend With Brad Pitt ... And Angelina . To Be Honest , I 've Never Seen Anything Exactly Like It . That 's Because I 'm Special . So You Still Don 't Have A Prognosis , Do You ? I Wish I Did , Jane . As Quickly As You Heal There Are Aspects Of Your Genetic Structure That Are A Little Weird . You Do Speak English . What 's This Mean For Me ? That We Continue To Study You , Try To Find Answers . If I 'm Still Alive . Look , Besides This , You Seem Quite Healthy . ... For A Freak ? That 's Not What I Said . But It 's What You 're Thinking . No , It 's Not , It 's What You 're Thinking . And You Shouldn 't Be . Actually , If You Break Down The Nucleus Of The Gene Cell ... Unless It 's In Latin , I 'm Not Interested . We Have A Briefing In Ten Minutes . I 'm Going For A Walk . This Was Five Years Ago , You Would 've Been Fried Doing That . You Mean Anyone Else But Me . Oh , Yeah , I See What You Mean . What 're You Doing ? Fixing A Bad Relay . I Like To Keep The Switches Working . What 's The Point ? Keeps Me Working , I Guess . Uh-Huh , Smart Man . You Okay , Jane ? No , But Rumor Has It I Heal Quickly . ( Maureen : ) Jane , Where Are You ? Andre Is Looking For You ? Here 's What W Dealing With . This Man , Still Unidentified , Was Caught Attempting To Steal Munitions From A Military Ammo Dump . Dead , Right ? There He Goes . That Was Last Month . Since Then , There Have Been Two Other Reports . Both Break-Ins , Both Attempts To Obtain Weapons Or Surveillance Gear , Where Someone Thought To Be Dead Turned Out Not To Be . You Guys Ever Encounter A Neuro That Couldn 't Be Killed ? Don 't Know . Killing ' Em 's Not In Our Playbook . Mostly , We Chip Them . No One Took Any Blood Samples From Any Of The Scenes ? There Weren 't Any . With That Kind Of Impact- - There Weren 't Any . Two Weeks Ago , An Unauthorized Entry Into The Safe At Farrington Construction ... The Designers Of The New World Commerce Building . The Wcb Is Being Dedicated In Three Days . I Hear The President 's Going To Come Into Town , He 's Going To Shake Some Hands , Kiss Some Babies . And Drum Up Some Campaign Contributions ? So We 've Got Attempts To Obtain Grade A Weaponry , Surveillance Equipment , Rifle Scopes . By Someone Who Might Now Have The Complete Floor And Ground Plans For The Wcb Tower . The Feds Believe The Incidents Are Related . They Handle Presidential Security . Where Do We Come In ? Given What We 've Seen And What We Know- - If There 's A Neuro Behind It- - It 's Our Deal . Are The Feds Authorized To Share Information With Us ? They Don 't Even Know We Exist . And We Have To Keep It That Way . I 'm Working On Tunneling Into Their Database So We Can Play Catch Up . No Luck So Far , They 're Good . I 'm Better , But They 're Good . How Do We Intervene On A Federal Operation If We 're Not Privy To Their Intel ? We Watch The Game . We Wait For Them To Throw A Pass And We Intercept . Football . The Name Of My Game . You Play ? She 's Talking About The Players . [ Laughs ] Oh . Most Of The Time After Work , I Just Want To Go Home , Be Alone In My Misery , Take A Shower , Have A Glass Of Wine Or Three . This Was Not One Of Those Times , I Wanted To Go Out , I Wanted To Be With People . The Question Was , What People ? Amanda Is My Next Door Neighbour , She 's Younger , Goes Out All The Time . ( Man 's Voice : ) Hey , Honey , It 's Your Father Again . Can You Give Me A Call , Just Want To Make Sure Everything 's Okay . I Know You 're Busy With Your Job , But Give Me A Call When You Can . Love Ya . Couldn 't Be Better . C 'mon ! And I Am The Best ! Yo , Andre . I Just Busted The Feds' Radio Encryption . They 've Hot Wired Into The Walking Dead Incidents They 've Got A Beat On The Perp , They 're Setting Up A Sting For Tonight . Want The Details ? Amanda Was Going Out And I Was Going With Her . What Did I Have To Lose , Except My Dignity . Am I Cramping Your Style ? No , Actually . You 're Pretty Hot . Thanks . I Just Felt Like Some Noise And Distraction . We 're Just At A Different Place In Our Life , You 're Together , And I 'm Still Looking For The Missing Pieces . I Hope You 're Looking In The Right Places . Whatever It Takes . But It 's Not What You Think . You Know What I Think ? I Know What Most People Think . I 'm Not Like Most People . I Noticed . I Mean Everyone Works So Hard To Fit In And Be Like Everyone Else . Seems To Me If You 're Gonna Work That Hard It Oughtta Be To Not Be Like Everyone Else . Some People Think I 'm A Freak , It 's Cool With Me . Being Different Might Not Always Be As Rewarding As You Think It Is . How Would You Know ? You 've Got A Job . You 've Got Stuff . You Don 't Have To Hustle To Get By . Seems To Me You 're A Lot Like Other People . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] Yes . Vasco , Andre , I Need You On Site . Alright , I 'll Be There . I 've Gotta Go . See Ya Around . Yeah , Sure . [ Siren Wailing ] [ Laser Fire ] Fire ! [ Gun Fire ] Secure Him ! He 's Dead . Do What I Said . Secure Him , Now ! Bring Him To Forensics . These Doors Stay Locked Until I Arrive . Secure The Area . Everyone Else , Debrief In Two Hours . I 'd Call That A Solid Interception . I Love Stealing From The Feds . Do You Love Stealing From The Feds , Too ? What 's The Rush Vasco , The Guy 's Already Dead ? And Here I Thought You Were An Adrenaline Junkie . Not When A Woman 's Driving . ( Seth : ) I Can Confirm Two Things . First , The Victim Is Not A Neuro . Any Doubt About That ? None . And Second ? There 's No Way This Man Could 've Attempted To Steal A Military Vehicle Earlier Tonight . We Were At The Scene Within Thirty Minutes , Seth . He Was Secured And Under Guard By The Feds Since The Moment He Was Apprehended . Well , The Man Lying Here , He 's Been Dead For At Least Five Weeks . The Body Went Missing Five Days Ago . Is Someone Always On Duty Here ? Twenty-Four Hours A Day . Mostly , To Answer Questions From The Tourists . Not Much Burial Ground Left Nowadays . Between The Crematoriums And Medical Research- - What About Security ? Why Bother ? So Anyone Can Get In ? Or Out . Doesn 't Take Much To See What Happened Here . The Way The Dirt 's Piled Up , The Hand Prints Along The Inside , No Tool Marks . That Grave Wasn 't Broken In To , Guys , It Was Broken Out Of . * [ Gunfire ] Riley ! Research , Boss . Maybe Closer Than You Think . From All Appearances It Seems Our Mr. Hawkings Over There Left Under His Own Power . Well , Since You Brought Him In , He 's Been Doing A Pretty Good Impression Of A Dead Guy . Seth Have Anything To Add ? Just A Post-Mortem . Aaron Hawkings . Died At Age Twenty-Seven Years Old From Complications Due To An Hereditary Cardiovascular Condition . You Check With Records ? Death Certificate 's Legit . He 'd Been Diagnosed As A Child . Since I Knew You 'd Ask ... I Came Up With At Least A Dozen Other Cases Of Corpses Missing From Graveyards . All Within The Last Nine Weeks . They 're All Young . And Hot . But Dead . You Haven 't Been On Some Of My Dates . You 'd Need Body Armor . All Male , All Under Thirty . In Life , All In Excellent Physical Condition . You Think A Woman 's Behind This ? Or A Football Coach . Those Guys Were Alive , They 'd Make A Helluva A Defensive Line . Or Soldiers . A Special Ops Team . If The Feds Are Right , And Whoever Broke In To Get The Plans For The New Tower Is Connected With The Other Break-Ins Helluva Way To Make A Move On The President ... Who 'd Be More Unstoppable Than A Small Army Of Corpses ? For The Newer Members Of The Class , What The Hell Are You Talking About ? Obviously A Neuro That Can Raise People From The Dead . Obviously . Can That Happen ? Haven 't Seen It Before But It Could Explain What 's Happening . How Is That Possible ? How The Hell Is Any Of This Possible ? How Can They Induce Hallucinations , Control Other People 's Minds ? We Don 't Have A Handbook Here , People . We 're Writing It As We Go . Gonna Ask Him For Help ? I Would If I Could . Guess There 's A First Time For Everything . Five Years Ago , I Never Heard Of A Neuro . Genetic Aberrations . I Don 't Even Know What We 're Dealing With . But We Deal With It . Why Do You Think He Didn 't Get Up And Walk Away , Like The Other Supposed Dead People . Proximity . The Neuros Need To Be In The Area To Exert Control Alright , When The Feds Sprung Their Ambush , Maybe They Scared Off The Neuro . And He Was Forced To Leave Mr. Hawkings Behind . Maybe . At Least In Special Ops We Knew What We Were Fighting And Why . This Is You Being Philosophical . I Want To Understand What It Is I 'm Asking My People To Die Fighting For . Perhaps We Aren 't Meant To Have All The Answers To Our Questions . Is This You Being Philosophical ? Not By Choice . Shocking , Isn 't It ? I Mean Who Has Books ? Why Not Read Online . Connection To The Past . Something You Can Touch Or Feel . Makes Me Feel Safe And Grounded . What 's Your Deal ? What Do You Mean ? I Mean What 's Your Deal ? I Know I Said You Seem A Lot Like Other People . But I 'm Not Sure About That . Is That Why You Invited Yourself Over Tonight ? To Try And Figure Me Out ? There 's Something About You That 's A Little Off To The Side . I 've Heard " Different " And , Most Recently , " Weird . " " Off To The Side 's " A New One . It 's Not A Bad Thing . Hey , Look At Me . You Think We 're Alike ? Maybe . The Difference Is , I 'm Cool With Being What I Am . But You , I Don 't Know , There 's Something About You , Like You 're Trying To Hide It From Everyone . I Think We 'd Better Call It A Night . There 's Still Half A Bottle Left . I 'm Beat . Maybe Another Time . Okay , See Ya . Amanda Was Being Honest And I Wasn 't . Truth Is , I Was More " Off To The Side " Than She Would Ever Know . I Was Angry , And Although It Didn 't Make A Lot Of Sense , I Had To Prove It To Myself . Ahhhhhh ! Like The Lady Said ... " Off To The Side . " It 's My Opinion , Sir , That The President 's Security Might Be Compromised . The Tower Dedication Cannot Be Rescheduled . Then His Security Team Needs To Be Fully Informed . They 're Already Aware Of Risk Potential . But Not What 's Behind It . Your Team Will Have To Work That Angle . That 's Four People . If We 're Up Against What I Think We Might Be- - The Decision Is Final , Agent Mcbride . Yes , Sir . Boss , We 've Got One On The Move . What ? Another Corpse . I Instructed Cemetery Personnel In The Affected Area To Keep An Eye On Subjects That Match The Physical Profile . Good , Where Is It ? Started Off At Lawnmore Cemetery . But He 's A Good Five Miles From There Now . How 're You Tracking Him ? I 'm On The Comm Set With The Cemetery Caretaker . I Talked Him Into Following The Guy . Brave Man . Not Really , He 's Crapping Himself So You Guys Better Get Rolling Like Now . We 're On It . Climbed Right Out Of The Ground And Walked Here . We 'll Take Care Of It . I Never Seen Anything Like It . He Climbed Right Out Of The Ground . Thanks . Alright , You And Maureen , You Take The Dead Guy . Connor And I , We 'll See If We Can Find His Controller . Okay . Alright . Climbed Right Out Of The Ground . [ Fighting Grunts ] Mo ! Noooooo ! Mo , Are You Okay ? Night Vision Goggles . See What Else You Can Find . Take It Easy . Looks Like The Neuro Gave Up The Fight . We Must Have Scared Him Off . What The Hell 's In This Place That Was So Important ? That 's What We 're Going To Find Out . ( Maureen : ) Basketballs And Tennis Rackets . ( Connor : ) It 's Full Of Sporting Goods . Maybe Joe Was Right . The Guy 's Starting His Own Team . How Does This Figure In A Specials Ops Mission To Hit The President ? It Doesn 't . Using Fit , Young Men To Form An Army ... His Name 's Albert Malley . Everything About Him 's Off-Profile . He Died Of Natural Causes Six Months Ago . What 's His History ? Sketchy . I 'm Not Sure If He Was Indigent ... Living Alone ... But I 'm Having A Hard Time Coming Up With A Last Known Address ... Family . You 're Having A Hard Time ? Temporary . Trust Me . I 'll Get What We Need ... I 'm Tunneling Into The I.R.S. You Can Do That ? Yeah . Wish I Knew You Eight Years Ago . Even If Someone Claimed Him As A Dependent ... I Should Be Able To Come Up With A Hit . Anyone Spotted Him ? Not Since He ... Arose ? The Locals Are All Over It . If They Find Him , I Will . What 's The Consensus ? Anyone Think This Is Wired Into The Tower Ceremony ? Even An Army 's Gotta Eat . Maybe He 's A Cook . You Know A Lot Of Dead People With Appetites ? Don 't Know A Lotta Dead People Walkin ' Around Either . The Dedication Ceremony 's Tomorrow Morning . We 're Going To Have To Keep On That Track Unless Anyone 's Got A Better Idea . This Is The President 's Route . He 'll Be In The Third Car From The Front And He 's Pretty Much Protected Until They Stop And Cross Into The Lobby Where The Ceremony Is . If I Was Going To Try For A Hit ... This Is Where I 'd Do It . There 's A Clear Line Of Fire From At Least Three Different Points ... Between The Limo And The Front Entrance There 's A Tight Window Of Exposure . But Enough Time To Kill Somebody . Yeah . We Have To Proceed As Planned . We 're Way Off Profile Here . Sporting Goods , Albert Malley ? You Really Think This Is About Hitting The President ? We Can 't Risk Otherwise . But If We 're Wrong ... And We Are ... We Might Be Putting Someone Else 's Life At Risk . No One 's Died So Far . So Far ! Last Night The Guy Tried To Put A Pipe Through Maureen 's Head . You Even Said , We Don 't Even Know What We 're Up Against . You Know I 'm Right About This . You Might Be . But We Have Our Orders . I Thought We Didn 't Take Orders . This Conversation 's Over . Nice Bike ! Thanks ! Is It Yours ? It Is Now . Doesn 't Run But You 've Got A Friend Who 'll Fix It . Yeah . Hey , A Guy Came By To See You . Great . It Was Your Dad . What 'd He Say ? Dad Stuff , I Guess . Kept Asking If You Were Okay . Said He Hadn 't Talked To You In A While . Yeah , Thanks . I 'll Tell You One Thing ... If I Had A Dad ... I 'd Talk To Him . Where The Hell 's Vasco ? ! Why Wouldn 't They Close The Area Off To Pedestrians And Private Vehicles ? Maybe They Thought That Would Draw More Attention . You Know , We 're Going To Have To Deploy , Even Short-Handed . If There Are Any Shooters , We 're Going To Have To Leave Them To The Feds And Hope They Can Stop Them . Because They Sure As Hell Can 't Kill Them . Connor , You Work Surveillance Up Here . We 'll Work Ground Level . If We See Anyone Who Looks Dead ? Radio To Connor . Give Him The Position And Hopefully The Neuro 's In Proximity And Can Be Identified . If He 's Not Wearing A Sign , How The Hell Are We Supposed To I.D. Him ? I Don 't Know . If The Shooter 's On The Move , The Neuro Will Probably Have To Play Tag And Stay Within Range . We 've Just Got To Do Our Best We Can . I 've Got Riley 's Reading Satellite , Looking For Unusual Movement . It 's A Long Shot . Yeah , It 's A Long Shot , But It 's The Only One We Have . Remember , We 're Dealing With A Small Window Of Opportunity So That 's Where We Focus Our Efforts . Let 's Roll . I 'm Hooking You Up To The Live Network Feed . Reading You Guys . ( Newscaster : ) ... On This Rainy Afternoon . Both Supporters And Opponents Have Come Together To Greet The Commander In Chief . Reading You Guys . I Know You Can Survive Gunshots . I 'm Not Sure You 'll Survive Andre If He Finds Out What You 're Doing . This Isn 't About The President And He Knows It . It 's Your Funeral . Sorry . I 'll Deal With Him When I Have To . How Do I Monitor Central Police Bands On This Thing ? If He Wonders How You Worked All My Gear On Your Own ... I Didn 't Help . Motorcade 's Approaching ... Now . ( Newscaster : ) You 're Watching Live Suv 's And Motorcade Roll Toward Their Destination . Here We Go , Guys . Connor . Forty Feet In Front Of Me , Heading Toward The First Entrance . I Got Him . Only From Behind , Though . Keep On Him . Closing In . Got Him ! Damn ! I Thought You Meant The President . Albert Malley Was Spotted Forty Miles From That Dedication Site . He 's Dead . Probably Has A Lousy Sense Of Direction . If Albert Malley Was There , The Neuro Was There . You Want Me To Call An Abort Into Mcbride ? Not Until I 'm Sure . Monitor That Band And Keep Me Posted . No Problem . The Hell With The President . I Didn 't Vote For Him Anyway . ( Newscaster : ) The Leader Riding On The Applause Of A Supportive Crowd . [ Crowd Cheering ] Connor ! All Clear From Up Here . [ Crowd Cheering ] Why Would A Federal Agent Be Interest In Albert ? It Seems That He Has Some Unclaimed Inheritance Funds To The Best Of My Knowledge , Albert Had No Family . No One That Was In A Position To Leave Him Money . You Have A Son ? Yes , Eric . He Lives With You ? I Don 't See Why Any Of This Is Your Business . Is Your Son Interested In Sports ? I Wouldn 't Know . Jim 's A Very Busy Man . And Eric ... Eric 's Always Kept To Himself , Mostly . Except For Albert . Albert Was Our Gardener And Handyman . He Was Close To Eric ? Yes . Mrs. Davies ... Where Is Eric Right Now ? I Tell Them What To Do And They Do It . They Never Tell Me What To Do Or Yell At Me . That 's Why They 're My Friends . I Can Play With Them Whenever I Want ... And They 're Never Mean . Why Are People Mean , Albert ? You 've Never Been Mean . You Always Liked Me . I Guess That 's Why We 're Friends , Right Albert ? What The Hell Does He Do Down Here ? Eric Comes Here To Play , Jim . Where Did He Get All This ... This Junk ? That 's His Stuff . There 's A Map Here . Do You Know Where This Is ? That 's The Statler 's Property Down By The River . There 's Nothing There . [ Gunfire ] We Can Do Whatever I Want , Albert . [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] Watch This , Albert . Who Are You ? My Name Is Jane . I Take It This Is Albert . What Are You Doing Here ? Finding Out How A Lonely Boy Spends His Time . You Shouldn 't Be Here . Should Any Of ... " Them " ... Be Here ? I Didn 't Hurt Anybody . You Know It Isn 't Right . You Have To Make It Stop . That 's None Of Your Business ! I Know All About Being Lonely , Eric . This All Started When Albert Died . Albert 's My Friend . And You Missed Him And You Got Lonely . But You Didn 't Take Him First . Because You Knew It Wasn 't Right . Doesn 't Albert Deserve To Rest In Peace ? Don 't All Of Them ? Damn . Can You Get Off A Clear Shot ? Bad Position . I Can 't Shoot Him While She 's Blocking Him . If I Can Get Behind Him , Over There . Distract Him . I 'll Circle Around . In Case We Need A Back Up . He 's Just A Kid ! He 's A Neuro ! [ Gunfire ] I 've Got This . I 've Got A Shot . Connor , You Okay ! [ Gunfire ] Come On Jane , One Step To The Right . ( Connor : ) Why Don 't You Chip The Bastard . Can 't Get A Clean Shot Without Hitting Vasco . What About The Healing Thing ? What About It ? Vasco . Woman 's Taken Shots To The Heart And Walked Away . We Can 't Rely On That . [ Gunfire ] Look , Dial The Range On That Dart For Three Feet Beyond Her . It 'll Pass Right Through Her . Maybe . At Least It 's A Definite Maybe . That Knife Takes Her Head Off , There 's No Maybe About It . [ Gunfire ] Albert . Eric , You 're Going To Be Okay . No One 's Going To Hurt You . You 're Going To Be Okay . Okay ? It 's Alright . What Did I Have In Common With This Boy Who Didn 't Shave Yet ? Absolutely Nothing And Yet Everything . We Both Knew What It Was Like To Be On The Outside . He Just Funneled His Torment Onto Dead People . Me , I 'm Still Trying To Find My Funnel . Startin ' To Smell Like A Bad Day Down Here . Let 's Go Kiddo . Where Are You Taking Me ? I Didn 't Hurt Anyone . It 's Going To Be Okay . I Had This Under Control . Didn 't Look Like It From Where I Was Standing . You Okay ? No , I 'm Not Okay . You Shot Me . I Shot Through You . And Could 've Killed Me . But Didn 't . Not That The Thought Hasn 't Crossed Your Mind . Maybe . ÕâÀïÐèÒªÌýÒë Giving Your Kids Stuff To Make Up For Not Having Time To Talk To Them , Can Have Serious Consequences . Some Turn To Gangs , Drugs , Street Life , And Some Find Less Destructive Ways To Deal With It . Eric Raised People From The Dead . I 'm Not Sure If That Falls Into The " Serious Consequences " Category Or Not . I Mean They Were Already Dead . The Problem With Distractions , Cookies , Balloons Tequila , Brad Pitt . They Never Really Solve Anything . Okay , Maybe Brangelina . The Point Is , Most Keep You From Having To Face Your Problems . Avoid Them Long Enough Though And You Never End Up Living An Honest Life . At Some Point You Have To Stop Distracting Yourself And Deal With What 's Really Bugging You . Like I Said , When You 're Young , You 're Given Something Good To Distract From Something Bad . Then We Grow Up . Hard To Say Exactly When That Happens , But It Happens . ... And Distractions Seem Harder To Come By . ( Man 's Voice : ) Hello ? Hello ? I Don 't Think I 'm Ready To Do That Now . Maybe It 's Because Seth Says I Have More Time Than I Realize . Nah .

I don 't know . What did she do it , Lu ? Stop the car . Turn around . We have to go back there . There ? To the cellar . Why open Pandoras box , ma ? Because maybe we 'll find something . A clue , any thing that will help us understand why this happened . No , I just want this whole thing to be over It 's not about you , Lucas . Look at me , I need this . I don 't know what we where thinking . We don 't have the key . We tossed it at the corner . I know . This is where my baby died . So what we 're looking for ? I don 't know . Answers . You 're okay ? Yea , I 'm sorry , my foot slipped . What 's that ? It 's ah ... When she was recording all her diarys , while we where kids . My memory lapses continue . One moment I 'm conscious , the next ... I wake up hours later with absolutely no memory of that . I 'm angry , and pearsing pain follows ... It 's like every nerve ending from head to toe being torn apart . I still don 't get to tell mom . I don 't wanna worry her . The treat certain subjects as if they were dead , and not treat them And they can 't worry about the ones that leave ? She needs to understand that people leave If they don 't believe me , don 't come back . The countless conversations with Gertrude , I believe and I 'm convinced to be part of his experiement . I 'm a lab rat of the necromante laboratory . I can feel his presence . And some days I think he 's down here . down in the cellar . That what she 's been painting ? Get rid of it ! Jesus christ , is that what she painted ? Who is it ? I don 't know . The man in the cellar ? A necromante . I don 't wanna look . Stay back . What is it ? Hope ? Who 's that ? ... me ? Ma ? You scared me half to death , Charlie . Oh , I 'm sorry . I thought you two could use a helping hand . If that was the case Mr. Longfellow , we would have ask . Lucas ! I 'm glad you two came back . Let me bring you some juice . Fresh squiced tomato juice , seeds and all ! No , thank 's , Mr. Longfellow . Just leave us alone . - it 's no time for tomatoes . - it 's always time for tomatoes , Lucas . Not to mention the wonders citric acid can do ... for those extra few pounds you put on ... - Look at you ! - Me ? - I 'm looking but i don 't see ... - Look harder . You know , back when i was in the service , we used to eat tomatos three times a day , just to keep ourselfs going . Enough ! Never again . Never again . She just wasn 't right . Have you been giving her drugs , Lucas ? - is that what it was ? - Ma , listen to yourself ... Hope ? ... You had to force feed her on adville , - Charlie . - Yes , Lucas ? Have you ever heard of necromancer ? Like a witch ? No ... there was Glenda , the good witch of Oz . No , Charlie ... in this neck of the woods . Lucas , let 's just leave . On the tape , Hope said she spoke to a Gertrude . When I was little , the kids used to talk about this old koock . They 're telling story 's , about how she was found in there , when she was an infant . Her name was Gertrude . - Ahh yes ... my wife . - Your wife ? - Estranged . - Take us to her . I don 't think that 's a good idea . She 's not a courtual woman , Martha . Angers quickly ... Charlie ... take us her , please . The necromante are watching me while I sleep , he is this dark shadow in the corner . He hides there , in the shadow . Gertrude said i should expect more , therefore he would disappear . And the pain has become even more unbearable . I only wonder , if I 'm the only one he watches ? - Martha ? - Yes ? - I just wanted you to know that ... - it 's not a good time , Charlie . I just wanted you to know , I believe they do come back . What 're you saying ? In the cellar , I heard you calling out for Hope . - Mr. Longfellow ... - Let me finish . And they stay there , not always , but most times ... yes . - But ... - Charlie ? - Honey . - What 's she doing here ? You ? I 'll ask you again , what 's she doing here ? How 'd she know who I am , Charlie ? I may have talked about you ... and my admiration for you . My daughter died a few days ago . Wish her my condolences . You spoke to Hope ... about an necromancer . That little thing with the paint all over her clothes ? Yes . She 's dead ? Yes . Wipe your feet ! Do it ! Sit . Sit ! What is all this stuff ? My life . What you doing ? We 're not alone . They 're always watching . Who ? Die soldaten . The soldiers . His soldiers . What was my daughter involved with ? Lester Krauss . A boyfriend ? Lester Krauss , is the most infamos ( ? ) of all time . A practitioner of the black magic . A witch ? To put it politely . And his soldiers . Die Soldaten . The soldiers , his soldiers , for decates they worked in unison with Krauss , on his experiement . Underneat this very earth , wich you walk upon Right in the heart of Darlington Falls . Well , we appreciate the information , Gertrude , I 'm sure , you like us to get out of your hair . No , no , no , wait a second . What experiement ? - That ... that 's all that she knows . - That 's all I told to you . Krauss 's experiement dealt with the evolution of warfare . Which is reffered to as the unholy Trinity . Timetravel , invisibility and mind control . Many believe to this day , the experiement continues to exist Using unwilling subjects . These subjects don 't remember there own amageninable torture bestowed upon them ... Only the after effects . Disappearing body parts . Period lapses of memory ... Insanity . Then why war fare ? What 's it to him ? Nothing at all ... but to the rest of the world and goverments , who work in conjunction with the necromante . Our own ... our own addministration has put a witch on the payroll . Why my daughter ? That i can not tell you ... Darlington is full of his followers . The possibilities of who may have exposed to are infinice . Now , get out ! I always loved you , Charlie . - Realy ? - But we both know why I left . Can I offer you some advice , Martha ? Yes . Don 't meddle in their cult . Your daughter is dead , and believe you me , the truth is more horrofying , then burying your firstborn . Let me offer you some advice , Mrs. Longfellow . The next time you decide to provicate your paranormal insanities on someone , just make sure it 's not me or my family . Those are not insanities . I just hit the tip of the iceberg , Martha . Just imagine ... She knew to much . They 'll ... come for you next . Charlie ! It 's true , is 'n it ? About Charlie Longfellow ? And our own government expierimenting on Hope ? - We have to go to the autorieties . - And say what ? We witnessed a murder . And we 're the only ones that survived ? Ma , how 's that look ? After we say Charlie Longfellow shot him self ... should we discuss the invisibility or time travel first ? Get some rest . Mommy ? I don 't wanna worry her . The sunflower is so beautiful , aware with the experiement . Help ! Lucas ! Lucas ! Lucas ! Help ! Help ! Lucas , help ! Help ! Lucas , Lucas ! Lucas ! Lucas ! Lucas ! Lucas ! Help me . Ma ? - You okay ? - No ! Get me out ! Oh , my God ! Lucas , what 're they doing to me ? It 's okay , it 's okay . - What happend , ma ? - I don 't know , I woke up ... - In the cellar ? - Yes ! - How is that possible ? - I don 't know , Lucas , how is it possible ? Someone took me down there ! I don 't know for what ever purpose . Someone was in our house , Lucas . - Who ? - I don 't know . But I think I know who does . What a pleasant surprise ! You two are becoming my favorite customers . I see you met my daughter , Camy . Daughter ? More sunflowers ? We know who you are . Realy ? Tell me , who am I ? you 're Lester Krauss . I may sell shit for eggs , but I ain 't no witch . So , you know who he is ? Sure ! Town folklore . You knew my daughter 's name . How ? You told me . You knew she shot herself , how ? You told me . Those things that you said : they 're playing with her future . What does that mean ? I don 't know , that 's what I was told . - By whom ? - You . No ! You wanna tell us something ? If you 're not him , you 're one of his soldiers . No , I am not . Now look , if you have such a hard on for Krauss , Folklore has it , he goes to the cemetery at night , before heading in to the woods Did you have anything to do with my sister 's suicide ? No . Maybe you 're to busy blaming others for your misfortune rather then turning the mirror on yourself . I was a good mother . Well , you keep telling yourself that , maybe one day you 'll believe it . No ! Don 't ! You took my daughter , I 'll take yours . Please , I swear , I don 't know what you 're talking about . Lester Krauss is just a tale told by parents to their children , so they wont wander the woods at night . I want my Hope back . Call it an eye for an eye . I call it Titt or Tatt . This has to stop ! This isn 't right , nothing makes sense . We 're opening up a can of worms , ma . What we 're opening up ... is beyond both of us ... I 'm scared shitless , We can 't stop . Hope is dead , ma . Don 't you wanna know why ? If she had troubles ... I don 't know . Why does anyone commit suicide ? Oh Lucas , you can 't believe that ! What if it 's all true ? The unholy Trinity ? The reason she was in so much pain ? The reason she shot herself ? She was brainwashed , Lucas . This is crazy ! Let 's just drive off ? We have to find 'm . We have to ... we have to make 'm pay for what he did to our family . If this is true , you know what we 're up against ? It 's not just the necromante , We 're talking about our government . We 're talking about revolutionicing war fare , and Hope was chosen to be his pawn , I don 't wanna hear this . You 're right , I 'm sorry , look ... can we just continue this in the morning ? - Yea , - Should we go back in the house ? Maybe we could just stay in the Cadillac tonight ? Cadillac sounds good . Lucas ! Lucas ! Wake up , there 's someone out there . Probably , just some cows , a goat , a sheep ... Ma ? Ma ? Ma ? Ma ! - Lucas ? - You okay ? How did I get here ? you 're left alone . Ma , we have to get out 'a here . Out of this dumb town , out of this house , away from that chair , everything . I 'm not leave-ing . I 'm not leave-ing until we find out who 's responsible for Hope 's suicide . The only clue we have is Darlington woods . - Mom , it 's miles and miles of land - We 'll start at the cemetery . - What 's a matter ? - Nothing . My neck it 's ahh ... it 's been doing this strange thing lately . Ma , ma ... it 's okay ... - Lucas ! Lucas ! - What ? - There was an arm . - An arm ? An arm ! Didn 't you see it ? - What are those ? - Nothing . Ma ! Ma ! Ma ! You okay ? Listen , ma , ma ... why don 't you lay down , and get some rest , I 'm worried . I don 't want to , Lucas , because I 'm afraid . I 'll watch you , okay ? I count every single one of your white hairs , if I have to . Just for a minute . You promise ? You 'll be safe , ma . I promise . After all , if you can 't trust your only son , who can you trust ? Ok ! Let 's go . Lucas ? remember of haveing a dream and then wonder , if it was a dream at all ? Lucas ? Lucas ! Seven ... eight ... nine ... eleven ... Lucas ! I know , I know . it 's the scenetic exersice . My God , Lucas ! you said you watch over me , you swore . I did , you got up and said you 'd be right back . No I didn 't ! I never said that ! You 're one o 'them . No , ma , ma ! God-damn it , open this door ! Sometimes I feel to question some things . Sometimes I 'm in another place . And at times I exist in the type of places ... Places that are miles away . Places that may not be yet . Once , I even thought I saw mom ... In the attic . How could I not to have noticed ? Give me strenght , honey . Help me find him , and kill him , for my daughter . - Who are you ? - Billy . - What you doing here ? - The necromante . Exuse me ? He helps me shoot , lady . Look overthere . See ? No . See what ? Scotty and Damien , from the eighth grade . Everything we need to pass the night and shoot the witch between the eyes for starters . Well , I don 't see anyone . Don 't worry , they 're there . They say he kidnaps newborns , at the stroke of mid-night , and brings 'm back to the forest . And then what does he do ? He waits for the mothers and then cuts them with his long finger nails and stuff . You 're not scared ? Don 't matter . Why are you here ? Same as you . She 's over here ! The witch ! Shut up ! What 're you doing ? Stop it ! I 'm not a witch ! Martha ! All right we got the witch ! Martha ? Martha ? Hope ? It 's you ... Martha . You killed them ! They just had a slap on their wrisk , So thank you . You 're part of this . First my father , now me , who is next Martha ? The Pope ? Lester Krauss has the blood of my daughter on his hands . Lester Krauss is dead . The man you 're after is been dead for the last 15 years . Ring a bell ? Martha ! The witch is dead . But it doesn 't mean his experiement is . You dough yourself deep , Martha ? You gonna need those claws of yours if you wanna see the light of the ... Ma , I knew I would find you here . Ma , you got to believe me , I 'm on your side . She was gonna kill you . We got to get out 'o here . We can 't go back home . Check her pulse , see if she 's alive . Ma , what happend ? You were attacked . - By who ? - By me . This isn 't wise , Martha . We 'll be gone in 20 minutes . The engine 's been running the whole time , there is no ventilation , it 's not gonna take long . you 're bluffing . Yea ? That 's what I said to my daughter before she blew her head off . Are you ready to die , Martha ? I 'm ! Are you ? I 'm not . If this training succeeds , will it save the life 's of American soldiers ? Does all this pain have a purpose ? I can 't take it ! I want to die ! I want to die ... Enough ! - Do you realy wanna know ? - Everything . Lester Krauss wasn 't a necromante . Lester Krauss was a scientist . He was trapped in a science that hadn 't been recognized yet , Martha . And since Krauss didn 't have any resources . He worked with the one government that allowed scientists to do experiements without regulations . The Nazi 's . After the war . Krauss had been recognized for his research and accomplishments . He was given the resources by our goverment to continue with his experiments and research In the forest . What about Hope ? Why did she kill herself ? Hope killed herself ... during a memory lapse ... when she thought she was in the future . But she did something , you made something with the one that didn 't get live . She killed Dino . - My daughter would never ... - You 're wrong Did you do this , Lucas ? Ma , please . You 're part of this experiement , you 're one of the soldiers . I didn 't participate in the Nazi experiement . - He is lying . - She is lying . He 's part of it . Get out . You take me to those experiements . you know where it is you 'll take me . - We don 't have to . - Yes , we do . No , we don 't . We don 't have to go , Martha ... they 'll be coming for us . Lucas ! Lucas ! - They took him . - They did . - You said ... - He 's part of the experiement , Martha , honest the god He just doesn 't know it yet . We got to move , they 'll be coming for us next before the night ends . Us ? Why you ? I 'm a lone soldier Martha , I 've told you already too much , I haven 't followed protocol . What 's protocol ? Charlie let to much information slip because his ( ? ) for you . He followed protocol . Oh , God ! They got Lucas ! It 's too late . He 's already dead . What did you do to my son ? Time travel , invisibility , mind control . The second element of Trinity was expierimented on Lucas , invisibility . But it failed . The final stages will begin after the first ( ? ) . The final stages of what ? Before he disappears , completely and forever . His invisibility failed , Martha . He 'll be dead before night ends . You and I have to stick togather . Hope 's gone . Maybe you can take care of me now ? Like you do your own children ? I can take care you . There is one question I ask myself everyday . How did he subject me to this experiement ? What does he do while I 'm asleep ? Or even while I 'm awake ? Nothing brings me joy cheerful ? Or at least to hear mom play the piano for me . Now I 'm wondering , as it would be the paradise . will it Be that she can take me there ? Hello ? Hello , doll . You ... you took my son . And you have my daughter . I 've been waiting for hours for her to get home . You caused me to worry and I 've been calling the hospital . But it 's like this that you make the ingrate . What are you talking about ? I know it shouldn 't have to be , but it 's necessary , doll . you have 10 seconds to let me hear my daughter 's voice , Or I 'll mutilate your baby with my own hands . No . - Seven seconds . - Don 't hurt my son ! Don 't hurt my daughter ! No , she 's here . - Three seconds . - No ! No . If you hurt my son , the next thing that you 'll hear from your daughter ... is her death scream . I 'll be 1 / 2 mile south down the road . your son for my daughter . If she 's hurt in any way , he dies . Where is she ? I 'll ask one last time : Where is my daughter ? She got away . I don 't believe you . Look at me . Do I look like a murderer ? I know you better than you think . I loved you . What ? I would have done any thing for you , before you brought my daughter in to this . What are you talking about ? You 're insane . My daughter is not here . Now your son dies . But first , you watch and see . Lucas ! Lucas ! Lucas ! Get in in the car ! Among , among ! Everything is fine , ma . I promise . No , it 's not , they 're after us . We 're together , at least . Ma , why you 're looking at me ? You don 't think I 'm part of this ? No , no ... What is it , ma ? They made another experiement with our family . They make another one with Hope ? No . Not Hope . What are you talking about ? The second part of the Trinity : The invisibility . The expieriment they made it on you . Realy ... it failed . What 'd you mean it failed ? I wasn 't good enough ? Maybe , she was just lying or maybe she just was wrong . I 'm dying , aren 't I ? Let 's go home . I think I know where your dad left the bullets - It 's to defend ourselfs . - Perfect . When is this supose to happened , ma ? Stop it ! I think I have a right to know . I don 't even know what 's going to happen . Where are those candies ? I found one . That was my baby . It 's time travel . Her face , her hand , this ... She said she saw me . Remembering the time , when She was coming back from the closet . That explains the pain she was in . Why shouln 't she appear all at once ? Maybe she just hasn 't learn 'd it . Let 's get out of here . Lucas ! I don 't feel to well . My whole body aches . No , no now . Walk away ! No , never . Please , I don 't want you to see this . Leave ! Forgive me , Lucas ? For everything ? I forgive you , ma . Just ... If Hope comes back , take care of her . And don 't make her do this . I didn 't want it to come to this . Forgive me , dear . I 'll cut off my ears for you if I have to . You mean everything to me , Lucas . I love you , ma . I love you . Time Travel . Invisibility . Mind Control . Come with us , Lucas . You knew I come back . I did ? Is it you ? Get off ! I just did . - Where 're you going ? - Down to the cellar . Do you have to , doll ? Listen , this heroic loveing mother wich you brainwashed yourself to be ... has cost me nothing but trouble , Martha . The third part of Trinity , Mind Control ? Is on the verge of being a complete success . This should be the last time I have to go down to the cellar . and get in to that chair , before my mind is completely gone . Well , I still haven 't found Camby . I 'm sure that Martha has planted in my head to not hurt your daughter . She would never hurt my daughter . But the real you would willingly sacrifice your own . I sacrificed my life for this project . First your daughter , then your son . Why don 't you save the last element of the Trinity for yourself ? Of all the test subjects to brainwash , why you , doll ? I 'm a perfect subject . By killing the real me , and replacing her with this happy homemaker . I completely shrout the expieriments secrecy . Even my own followers don 't have a face to put on their leader But doll , you deserve the credit . You did it . You made it work and not that Nazi . The credit is nothing . The technology is all that 's important . And I gotten it in to the right hands , Uncle Sams . And anyone that knows about it 's Nazi origins has to be eliminated . Can you imagine the chaos , if the world found out we collaborated with a Nazi ? Krauss would be jealous if he was alive . Little Martha , the all American scientist ... Who was so willing to learn from the greatest , no matter who he swore his alliedgents to . has finished his masterpiece . It wasn 't easy , I never expected her to be so inquiciete , and get so close . Well , I had my recruits watch , in case we had to throw her of the path . The Soldiers . So loyal , so trusting . it 's not trust , it 's dedication . Let 's just be greatfull . The experiement is in Uncle Sam 's hands now . It 's to great of a power to be in the hands of some madman . That 's why I asked for Krauss to be assacinated . He was gonna take it back . Change the past . Meddle with the future . What if he brought that technology back to the Germans in the 2nd War ? - We would have lost the war . - You is right , dear . You 're sweet , you know ? It 's to bad you had to play your little games . My little games ? Inside jokes , They 're playing with your future . Just having a little fun . I have games too . Here we go , Martha . Not again . Oh , my God ! It finally worked ! Martha . He 's here ! Mom ! [ In The Cellar ] Get back ! Krauss , Krauss ! Is back ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Hope ? Will you let me in ! Please ! Mom I miss you so much . I don 't know how much time I have before I go back ? I will be here , It is safe , now . Oh , my God ! He 's dead . I shot him . Why you 're doing this ? Who did you shoot ? Who did you shoot ? Go inside , Hope , I don 't want you to see this . Give me the rifle , mom . I can 't . Give me the rifle ! I know nothing here makes any sense , But you shouldn 't be here , you have to trust me and open this door , mom . I can 't help you . I know your good . Please , you don 't understand ? Lester is coming for me . No , he 's dead . Krauss is dead . I thought he was dead before , but I just shot him . How do you know the name Lester Krauss , mom ? Look . Lucas ? I did what you asked , ma . I watched you while you where sleeping . - Lucas ? - I didn 't like what I saw . It was you .. What are you talking about ? Our mother is a murderer , Hope ! She did this to us . She brain washed us both ... in thinking she 's a normal and careing mother . It can 't it be true , can it , mom ? I don 't know . You don 't know ? What do you mean : You don 't know ? I don 't know . All I know is that I love you and Lucas . My life is so ... Look at me , ma . I 'm dying . Please stop , Lucas . - Krauss is dead , Hope . - No , he 's not , he faked his death . Lucas , please , let me come in . And is everything false ? Look , that 's what he just wants us to believe . Lucas , look at Hope . Trinity is beginning to work . He is here to take us back ? As if the Holocaust never ended ? No ! It 's you ! You 're the Nazi ! Hope , she is a murderer . No , Hope . Shoot ! I can 't ! It doesn 't have to be that way . - Shoot . - No ! Shoot her ! Hope . Oh , my God ! Sit tight ! Hope ? Hope ? Hope ? Mommy ? ZXWY , transmitting to bring the latest news .

 Excuse me , sir . You need to see this . So this could get you your old job back ? No . It could get me a better one . Just because you know where a whale is ? No , I told you . It 's not a whale . Oh , right . It 's an unclassified marine vertebrate . That 's right . One that 's moving at over 100 knots . Over 115 miles an hour . That 's faster than anything in the water . And you discovered it . Well , yeah , I mean , I was the first to see it and record it . Until they screwed you out of everything . Whoa ! Hey , we don 't use language like that . Except when it 's accurate . Do you know what this is ? This is a GPS signal picked up off NSA Carnivore . Someone 's tagged a live one . Who ? It 's a mystery . Like the crew of the Topeka . 111 men gone without a trace . You can 't leave . You 've got responsibilities . Poker night . Duck season . I 'm honoring my responsibilities by doing this . Tracy and the kids are here , man . Hey , it 's all right . I ain 't going forever . - What about my porch ? - Come on , man ! We 'll finish your dang porch when I get back . Figure out what it is I 'm supposed to do . Is that like you figured out your decor in the living room ? Look , I 'm going to talk to the only person I know that saw the same thing I did . Man , I gotta find somebody . Anybody else who 's going through what I am . I 'm dying here . She knows you 're coming ? Not exactly , no . Look after her , all right ? Yeah . He shocked me and knocked me on my butt . He 's a menace , man . No , he 's not . He just ate Amber Lou 's dog , dude ! That 's bad ! - " If found , please call " - We don 't need to call . People are gonna find out . Like your parents . Yeah . Hey , maybe I 'll come clean . You know , maybe they 'll just let me keep him . Don 't be a sucker . There 's only way to go in a situation like this . - What ? - Full and total denial . Hello . Hey . Hey , it 's Rich . Oh , my god ! Rich ! Hi . Hey ! How are you ? Oh , I 'm all right , I 'm all right . - How about yourself ? - Good , great . I tagged one . Get outta here . Yeah , just this past weekend . Right off the far all ones . How about that ? What , did you get it from the boat ? No , I was in the water . It was crazy . I ... Wow . Them mothers are big , ain 't they ? Yeah , you could say that . They 're huge . Where are you ? Oh , I 'm actually in California . Had some business out here . A little conference . How far are you from Sausalito ? Uh ... a couple hours . You are so dead . Amber is , like , mortified . Really ? Duh ! I 'm sure she 's telling her mom that your thing ate her dog . Do you honestly think no one is gonna find out ? Find out what ? - Honey , are you okay ? - Yeah . I 'm fine . Don 't say anything . Hi , Cathy . Amber 's mom . You are such a goner . Oh , of course I 'm listening . It just sounds so ... Oh , Cathy , I 've never allowed Miles to have a pet let alone . Well , if something happened next door , shouldn 't you be calling them ? Okay then . I 'll talk to him . That was Amber 's mother . Is she on some kind of medication ? No , she 's fine . Why ? Well , Amber 's dog 's missing , and I guess they 're very upset . Hey , there ! That sure beats the last boat we were on , huh ? Hey , nice to see you . Oh , hey , I thought I 'd gone overboard . Man , that 's only some of it . Here you go . - Oh , thank you . - Sure . You see this ? I 've got a friend at the weather tracking service , and she took satellite photos of my tagging trip . - Oh , wow . - Yeah . - This is a whole pod of them . - Yeah . Maybe even a school . Look at that . That is amazing . But I saved the best for last . Check it out . Listen . - Ha ! That 's him ? - Yeah . Yeah , he 's 34 north , 117 west . Heading down to the north end of Baja . - See ? - Yeah . You can see the history of his route . Track his movement over time . Right here . Look at that . Well , they 're out there . He 's out there . Hi . Got a present for you . I don 't take the sat for two more years . Never too early to start . It 's how your sister got a 1450 . I could study for 50 years and I wouldn 't make a 1450 . Now , what kind of attitude is that to have , hmm ? The truth . Read . Oh , no . Oh , no . - Hey , Phil . It 's me . - Miles ! Just a second . Yeah , what do you want ? You 've gotta move Nim . Now . It 's like I told the girl 's mother . We don 't have any pets . Well , a lot of parents think that , ma 'am , then find out different . Believe me . I know what my children are up to . I 'm a very involved parent . Miles ! Well , these exotic dealers , they don 't need a note from your parents . Not as long as you got the cash . Yeah ? Mr. Furella is here from animal control . Howdy . Did you find Amber 's dog ? I sure am glad I came out here . Yeah , me too . It 's nice to have someone to talk to . My neighbors think I 'm crazy . Listen , there 's something I 've been meaning to talk to you about . Um ... and I apologize if I get too personal on you here . Well ... I 've been , um , having some issues since the accident . And , well , I was wondering if you 'd had anything that ... like a a daydream . Or , like , a flashback , you know . It 's like a ... a strong daydream . Like a " light at the end of the tunnel " type of deal . No , man . I 'm sorry , I haven 't . Well , that 's okay . - That 's weird . - Huh ? What 's weird ? It 's , um ... it 's never come that close to land before . This could be our chance to get it on tape . Do you understand what this means ? If I can get a videotape of the animal in the wild , good-bye plagiarism , hello , tenure . All right ! Well , how far to the Russian river ? - Like , three hours . - Make it two . Jesse , come on ! We don 't have time for this , baby , come on . I 'm sorry here we go . Okay , we 're gonna go see daddy , great . Good boy , Jesse . - Hey , buddy ! - There we go . Hey ! We were just checking to see yeah , that 's a good boy . Put on your seat belt . This , uh , Amber , told me it looked like a reptile with a head fin . Could be a caiman . Or a land iguana . Killers . Gut a sheep right through . It shocked Amber 's dog ... to death . Then ate it . It was ... horrible . It was like an electrocution . I hope I 'm not insane when I 'm your age . You 'll be in jail when you 're my age . Okay . I don 't know what 's going on here , but if it keeps up , I 'm gonna call your father . All right , step back . I 'll get it . Stay calm , stay calm . Savannah . Savannah , move . Oh , I didn 't mean to do that . Oh , mom ! Mom ! What am I gonna tell Cathy ? Look at this mess . I can 't believe it . Look what you did ! I didn 't poke it that hard , ma 'am . That pool 's just old . It 's just old . Nim ! Come on , dude ! Come on , Nim . Be a good boy , please . I want to know what happened to Amber 's dog , and I want to know now . I told you . I don 't know . - Savannah ? - No , mom , he 's lying ! He does know ! He 's been hiding that lizard thing in Phil 's backyard . What ? Yeah , mom . A lizard that executed Amber 's dog with a ball of lightning . I don 't appreciate the sarcasm , Miles . Look , me ? What about her ? Well , Savannah doesn 't have some pet I don 't know about . I don 't know what happed to her dog . Okay ? Maybe it woke up , got a load of Amber , and ran off . When you 're ready to tell me the truth , young man , you come talk to me . And don 't be late for school . How does everything around here get to be my fault ? Chill , honey . It 's all cool . No , Phil , it 's not cool . It was cool . What ? Well , see , I thought I 'd put Nim inside your mom 's car . Come on , we gotta go . Rich , you can 't pass here . Oh ! You know the speed limit 's , like , 55 around here . Don 't worry . If I get a ticket , it won 't track back home . They ain 't on the whole computer national computer thing yet . Not really what I was referring to . Ha ! Misunderstood what that look was for . Oh , don 't worry . This is as fast as she goes . - That 's a double yellow . - No problem , I got this . Now how long you been tracking this thing ? Um , since last Saturday . It 's never done anything like this , right ? - It 's never gone up in a river or - No , I told you . It 's never come within 20 miles of land . Oh , come on , this guy won 't get out of my way ! Hey , whoa , Rich . Come on , this is not the road . That 's what this baby 's for , off-roadin ' . Look , man , I want to see this thing too . I just don 't want to get killed doing it . I 'll be careful . All right ? You 've got my word . You 're not out here on business , are you ? No . Excuse me . Excuse me . Could I get some help over here , please ? Right away , ma 'am . - You see her car ? - No , nothing . She better be here , man . Relax . We 're gonna get your critter back . Nimrod . His name is Nimrod . Okay , dude . Chill . Don 't tell me to chill ! All right , I 'm not on the honor roll . I can 't throw a football . Nim is my extra curricular , all right ? Sure , man . Whatever you say . I just hope it don 't do to your mom what it did to Amber 's dog . Yes , sir . We 're working on it . We 'll have the name of the person who 's tracking the animal shortly . Yes . Sir . I understand . Look , can you hang on a moment , sir ? Give me a realistic time frame . This isn 't simple , you know . They have to vet the satellite trilateralation feed and check that against a time . In simple , non-technical language . It takes what it takes . We 'll have a name soon , sir . Okay , just take this . And that goes with it too . Yes . All right , let 's go . Dude , this is gonna be bad . Excuse me . Your aquarium exploded in my living room . I 'm sorry . We don 't sell aquariums . Well , you did last week . A special . Line starts right there . Need a check authorization on five . Check authorization on five . No waiting at check stand four . No waiting , register four . - Are we just cutting school ? - This is an emergency , Phil . We gotta think what Nim 's gonna do . What 's a wild animal do in a grocery store ? Nim 's not wild . He ate that lap dog in one bite . - Are you looking ? - Yeah , dude , I 'm looking . But seriously , you 're giving me the heebs . What 's all the commotion about ? What are they doing to him , man ? I don 't know . - Ooh ! A piece of that ... - Oh , yeah ... Can I get one ? Mm . I guess I 'll try it ... How 's the signal ? How are we doing ? Still moving up river . 10 miles past the head waters . Hello ? Rich , Bug is telling me you were going to California . Honey , you won 't believe it ! I 'm on the hunt . - I 'm tracking one right now . - Okay , it 's right here . - It 's gonna be coming up , okay ? - Okay , yeah . Okay , did I just hear a woman 's voice ? - Yeah , it 's Laura . - Who is Laura ? Laura Daughtery . The biologist . South Carolina . Remember ? She tagged one . - You son of a bitch . - Turn , turn , turn . Look at what the data 's migration projections are showing . Not projections anymore . We identified the tagger . Laura Daughtery . - We are not going to do anything - It 's a difficult situation . Oh , yes . They won 't allow free radicals to run around out there . Look , she could get a tape . Then it 's out on the news , on the web . Viral . And once it 's out , you can 't get it back . So she should be killed and dumped into the river ? Of course not . But information must be controlled . No threats . Listen , Davis . If anything happens to Dr. Daughtery , I will quit . Attention piggly wiggly customers , all dairy products are marked 30 percent off today , so load up on all your dairy needs while you shop at the pig . Come on . Oh ! Whoa ! So what was in this aquarium ? Fish . That it ? Plants . Filtration . It all came with the package . Sure your kid didn 't start an outboard in it ? Because it wouldn 't be unprecedented . You would not believe the crazy stuff that kids put in fish tanks . Furniture . Pets . Little brothers . Miles . - Excuse me ? - Nothing . Uh , ma 'am ? Try the pie , it 's on sale today , 30 percent off ... so , uh , congratulations , Dan . Still moving up river . Should be visible in , like , a minute or two . All right . All right . Let 's go ! I knew there was a reason . For me to come out here . 35 seconds . See , I 'm not like you . I never had , like , biology or , you know , any interest or I never had a passion at all , really . I mean maybe fishing , but ... Should be coming right round the bend . You know , nobody really ever wakes up wanting to bean insurance salesman . These last few weeks , I tell you , I 've really felt like ... this is all happening for a reason . And that I got a really big part to play . You ever get that feeling ? Yeah , I do . Ten seconds . Yeah . You getting it ? Yeah . I 'm getting it . Hey , boy ! I mean , if that 's not evidence , I don 't know what is . Thanks for getting here so quickly . Listen , I don 't know what we 're dealing with , but I have some seriously upset customers . Maybe we should evacuate . This place does ten grand an hour . I just want it out of here before the lawyers start showing up . All right . Look at that creep . We can 't let him get Nim . Nim 's gone , man . Outey . We should take the hint . Nim . Nim . It 's okay . It 's me . It 's Miles . I 'm not gonna hurt you . It was an accident . You made the nailgun go off . I 'm gonna take the nail out and then you 'll feel better . Dude , Miles , they 're coming . See ? All gone . We gotta go now , dude . Come on , let 's go . Look what we got here . Oh , you boys are in big trouble . Let 's go . Come on . Come on ! Let go of me . Move it ! We 're fueled and ready . Arrival in Sausalito , three hours , sir . My name is Brian . I 'll be your server today . I have one special to tell you about . We have a Cajun salmon , it 's lightly blackened , served with a side of Jambalaya . Two great appetizers on there . We have shrimp and grits . It 's really good . Also on the spicy side . We have crab dip also if you ... - Is that a whale ? - Yeah . Humpback . Pretty common this time of year . Um , actually , they go south in spring . We have visual . Excuse us , sorry . - Look . - I 'm looking at it . No , the cameras . Ladies and gentlemen , we will not harm this animal . We 're going to attempt to convince his animal to head back out to sea . I repeat , we will not harm this animal . Hey . It 's still here . - What ? - It 's still here . Listen . Well , young man . You 've really outdone yourself . You really have . Shall we review the last couple of weeks ? Brought up home by the coast guard at 4 : 00 in the morning . Lying to us about a pet lizard . Which ate Amber 's dog . Oh , what am I gonna say to Amber 's mother next time I see her ? Two weeks and you 've been in more trouble than Savannah has in her entire life . Anything you want to say for yourself , partner ? I 'll get it . Manners . Hello ? Hey , baby ! It 's daddy . - What 's going on ? - I miss you , daddy . Oh , I miss you too , baby . Hey , is mom around ? Mom , dad wants to talk to you . I don 't think she wants to talk to you right now . She wants to know why you 're in California , dad . All right , well , it 's ... it 's okay . It 's okay if she doesn 't . Just , uh ... tell her daddy loves her . Okay , baby ? Okay . And I love you too , all right ? Bye . Bye . - Hey . - Hey . Hey , listen . I sure am sorry if if I scared you earlier today , you know . I can get a little riled up sometimes . Face facts . I mean , hey . You can 't call this a coincidence when I drive all the way from California ... Can I be honest with you ? You did scare me a little bit earlier . I mean , we don 't know each other that well . You know , and , um , the only thing we really have in common is this . And if we 're gonna keep going , I have to be able to trust you . Absolutely . And I hey , you can trust me . Okay ? I promise . I swear you can trust me . - Excuse me . - Yes ? - Are you Dr. Laura Daughtery ? - Yeah . Would you mind coming with me for a moment ? - Who 's asking ? - Yeah , just hang on a second . Nobody 's going anywhere . What 's the problem ? This is not a request , ma 'am . - I 'm talking to you , not her - Please , this is not your concern . I understand that , sir , but ... get your hands off me ! You don 't touch an officer . You know what ? There 's something going on here , and these people have a right to know about it . They know what 's going on too , y 'all ! They know , and they don 't want you to know ! Come with me . 30-eye witnesses all describe a large mammal , a whale some say , which ... Are you done watching ? My head is killing me . And here 's where the story gets stranger . It seems to have hit a submerged power cable . Never a thing on TV . Feeling any better ? How I 'm feeling isn 't the problem . He 's trying , Sylvia . Trying ? Trying to get brought home by animal control ? That 's not trying . Trying is standing in line at the grocery store with a broken aquarium like an idiot , suddenly realizing that your son has been lying to you about having a pet lizard ... Now wait a second . Maybe he 's been lying to us because we 've been a little too hard on him . Hard ? The kid has every toy known to man , a 100-volume video game collection . Oh , and have you seen his grades lately ? So he 's not an academic like this sister . Well , that 's an understatement . He 's gonna have to improve . I don 't know how he 'll ever get into college . Nice work . Got the parents fighting . Where 's the lizard ? Oh , right . Top secret . He ran away . Happy ? Oh , my god . You miss that thing . It 's a reptile , moron . It has a brain half the size of a pea . You 're , like , bonding with a vegetable . You really can 't take it personally . Well , you have the right to remain silent . Oh , I know it , but it don 't really matter . Big old cover up going on here , I know it . Everybody knows it . I 'm gonna prove these things exist . I 'll tell you that . My little brother didn 't die for nothing . Sure , buddy . Get in the car . Freak . Little late this time , Dr. Cirko . A lot of people saw it . How you , uh--how you gonna spin that one ? - We won 't have to . - Um , yeah , you will . A lot of people had cameras out there . The creature pulsed , and all digital data within two kilometers was destroyed . Don 't try to scare me with your crap , man . I have some experience with this problem . I 'm sorry . But , listen , um , I want to discuss something . - You can 't stop me . - I 'm not here to stop you . There are government interests that want to keep control of what is happening here . They have decided to have you involved . But it is not why I want you . I want you involved because ... you 're a good scientist . And I respect you . Which you demonstrated to me by framing me for plagiarism . I pointed out that you had managed to do something with almost no resources that we failed to do with tens of millions and the United States military . You tagged the creature . Why should I work for you after what you 've done to me ? Because you will be present for history .

( GUN FIRES ) Stop fighting ! For your own good ! ( SCREAMING ) Micah ! I can 't be trusted . Can I help you , ma 'am ? Yeah , you can arrest me for murder . You said that there were people who wanted to hurt me . CLAIRE : I think they got to Zach and Lyle . Just stay where you are . You 're gonna be okay . ( SCREAMING ) I work for your father . He sent me here to make you forget . Tell me , claire , can you keep a secret ? This guy puts out 1800 curies of radiation without ever coming in contact with nuclear material . Ted , he escaped . Nathan . What are you doing here ? You had to be a hero , didn 't you ? I have to stop that bomb . I have to save everybody . Peter ? Peter ! It 's all my fault . ( MACHINE BEEPING ) ( GATE BUZZING ) MAN : Get your mind right , yet , Niki ? If it was me , I 'd leave you in the box here a few more weeks . Even animals like you get a lawyer visit . Now , you just move real slow-Iike , you hear me ? Nice and easy . Show me your hands ! Come on . Keep ' em up . MAN 2 : Let 's go . WOMAN ON TV : Union Wells High School opens its doors today for the first time since 16-year-old Jackie Wilcox was brutally murdered during her homecoming game two weeks ago . Teachers and students wrestle with how to remember the slain cheerleader , while still trying to move on . This is Angela Bromstad , Channel Five News . MAN : Thank you , Angela . Look at all those reporters . You don 't have to worry about the press . They 're not allowed on school grounds . I 'm more worried about the other kids . They 're gonna want to ask me questions about it . Well ... You don 't have to tell them anything . Well , good , because I don 't really remember much . I mean , I know that 's supposed to be post-traumatic stress or whatever , but nothing ? Nothing at all ? Memory 's a funny thing . I think it 's a blessing that you don 't remember . Where 'd you find me ? What do you mean ? The night Jackie got killed . You said you found me by the stadium ? You were scared to death . You were traumatized . You just wanted to go home . I don 't remember . Thanks . I guess I 'd better go . Not so dangerous anymore , are we , Mr. Sylar ? DOCTOR : We 've gone over every strand of code , trying to find the codon switches that identify his aptitudes . Other than telekinesis , we 're drawing a blank . Has he responded to the glycimerine ? Given him enough to kill an elephant . Nothing . We 're no closer . If we keep up at this rate , he 'II be dead by tomorrow . After what he did to Eden , he 'd deserve it . Unfortunately , they haven 't authorized that . He stays alive . You 're just going to have to dig deeper . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( SIREN WAILING ) You 'd better be right about this , Parkman . ( ALL CHATTERING ) Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Let 's go ! ( MAN CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO ) We swept this entire place . There 's nothing here but paper . Did you check the basement ? Yeah . Stairwells ? More paper . Hey , where is he ? Where is he ? Where 's Sylar ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . He 's not here , Parkman . Nice going . MAN : We appreciate your cooperation . Oops . MAN ON TV : The Tyrannosaurus Rex was a huge , meat-eating dinosaur . It lived during the late Cretaceous Period , about 65 to 85 billion years ago . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) If we could go back in time , there 's no telling what wonders we 'd find . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) Tyrannosaurus Rex was a fierce predator . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) He 's burning up . Persistent idiopathic fever . It means they have no idea what 's wrong . fly in the best doctors in the world just to have them tell me they don 't know what they 're doing in four different languages . His heart , they don 't know how much more he can take . 26 years old , he 's gonna die of a heart attack . He 's not gonna die , Ma . Well , he will unless I do something . Why don 't you just let the doctors do what they do ? I wish I knew what was going on in there . Just before he passed out , he said he felt he was absorbing too many powers . Peter wanted to see that painting . After I told you not to let him . You knew he was gonna follow that thing headfirst all the way to Texas . He 's my brother , and I Iove him . But we both know he shouldn 't have even been there . It was important to him . You really believe all this crap ? The future ? Paintings ? The end of the world ? I know he believes it , and I believe in him . Fine , then show me . I 've been in this damned hospital room for two weeks waiting for something to happen . I 'II be damned if I 'm gonna sit around and watch my brother die . Take me to the artist . I want to see what 's worth all this . I Iove you , man . Okay , your first mistake ? Never put the peanut butter in the refrigerator . Mom always keeps it at room temperature . Well , your dad 's got his own style . I see that . But it still tastes good . Hey , what happened to you ? Did you get in a fight at school today ? It 's nothing , just some jerks . Well , what happened ? Dad , they called Mom a psycho killer . I know , you can lecture me about not fighting . No , no . I know how hard it is without her . I wish it could be easier . But we gonna make it . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) You enjoy that . I 'II be back . I believe you were expecting me . The name is Malsky , Aron Malsky . I take it you have it here . The charges against me been dropped ? Your wife 's confession took care of most of that . And her pointing out where to find the bodies helped , too . As for the other charges , consider yourself a free man , Mr. Hawkins . So , no more looking over my shoulder ? Only if you wish to see where you 've been . So , that 's it ? Linderman leaves me and my family alone ? Oh , I wouldn 't bank on that , no . That was the deal . You got back your $ 2 million . There is no deal , Mr. Hawkins , unless Mr. Linderman says there 's a deal . You took something of his , and he reserves the right to let you make that up to him . Believe me , you 'II be the first to find out when he chooses to call in that debt . You have a nice day , now . ( BANGING ) ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) I 'm glad the bureau finally decided to take the list I offered seriously . Too many people showing up dead or missing . If you didn 't have a record showing you were in India when some of these people were killed , you and I would be having a very different conversation . Well , fortunate for me , then . Mmm-hmm . You say your father compiled this list ? Yes , he was a geneticist . AII the people on the list share a unique genetic marker that he was able to map and track using the human genome project . Uh-huh . I 've been trying to locate them . To warn them . About this man , Sylar ? Yes , the man who killed my father . I see . Well , we ran the name . Nothing . clearly an alias . But we did follow up on another name you said was on the list , a Sarah ellis ? Yes , I tried to locate her in Los Angeles , but she wasn 't at any of her known addresses , and , no , I 've never met her before . Are you sure ? That 's Sarah ellis ? I know her by a different name , Eden McCain . She lives across the hall , right there . She 's been gone for a few weeks . Is there a problem ? She turned up three days ago . Well , what was left of her , anyway . What ? Yeah , they pulled her out of Lake Ramsey , in Sudbury . Hundred miles out of Ontario . Gunshot wound to the head . Local law wrote it up as a suicide . The last I heard from her she said she had something to confess to me . You say she was your friend ? I don 't know what she was . The guy who you were just talking to has Sylar in this building . No , Parkman . Yes . He doesn 't . There 's nothing in here but paper . But we didn 't look everywhere . Maybe , maybe there is a secret room somewhere . Okay ? Maybe ... And maybe I can whistle The Star Spangled Banner out of my ass . We are lucky he hasn 't threatened to sue us for this stunt . Want to know what 's on this tape he just handed me ? You , caught on the parking lot surveillance camera . What , you didn 't think anyone would notice a guy sitting in the same car every day for two weeks ? Do you have any idea the position you 've put this bureau in ? I was following on a hunch . Whose hunch ? My hunch ? The bureau 's hunch ? Matt 's hunch . He abducted people . He abducted me ! He abducted Ted Sprague . Sure , the guy with the radioactive hands ? Well , it all makes perfect sense . I am going to make sure you are benched for this . What , that 's it ? Obviously . We both know he 's in here . Do we ? 'Cause all I know is that I have wasted the Iast three weeks of my Iife on the crazy idea that you can hear people 's thoughts . And I 'd liked you , Matt . I felt sorry for you , and maybe that clouded my judgment . But now I need to get back to reality and you should do the same . Go home , Matt . We 're done . Hey . Hey , you son of a ... Listen to me . I have no idea how you are pulling this off , but I swear to God , I 'm not gonna stop until I figure it out . You understand me ? Good luck with that . Zach ? Hey , this is a public place . You sure you can be seen here with me ? Why not ? Right , I forgot . You 've been body-snatched . Look , I just wanna talk . Hey , I 'm sorry about Jackie . I know she was your best friend and all . You know , I actually discovered that someone else was my best friend , but I lost him , too . What happened to you on homecoming ? I can 't remember . Can 't remember a Iot of things lately . Yeah , that 's funny , 'cause lately I can 't remember . Must be something in the water , eh ? Zach , look at me . Do you feel like we could be friends ? Us ? No . We wouldn 't play well together . I gotta tell you , Miss Sanders , the outbursts are not helping . Kind of getting tired of them myself . Look , I just wanna do my time in peace . Yeah , about that . It seems the D.A. is gonna file for special circumstances in the homicides . They 're gonna seek the death penalty . Death penalty ? Look , I know it 's a Iong shot , but it might help if you cooperated a Iittle . And how am I supposed to do that ? The two million dollars ? Things might go a Iittle smoother if you tell the police where it is . I told you , I don 't know anything about that . JESSICA : Who are you trying to fool ? You know exactly where it is . I 'm sorry ? He 's right , Niki . We should tell them . NIKI : Stop it . ( GASPING ) Don 't pay any attention to her . Pay attention to who ? JESSICA : God , who am I gonna have to screw to get out of this place ? NIKI : I said stop it . What is this ? JESSICA : What 's it look like , dipstick ? What , you 're going psych on me ? If that 's what it takes . Multiple personality disorder is a real hard sell . When I want your opinion , I will ask for it . Just get us a damn shrink . ( GASPING ) NIKI : I 'm not crazy . No , I 'm not crazy . Don 't listen to her . please , I 'm telling you the truth . Of course you are . No , don 't listen to her . Listen to me , please . I 'm not lying to you . Of course you 're not . ( GATE BUZZING ) I am telling you the truth . Which way to gift store ? Thank you . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( ALARM BLARING ) ( EXCLAIMING ) Hiro . Hiro . Isaac was obsessed , ranting about a bomb coming to explode New York . The painting on the floor ? Yeah . Then he just left . Someone came and took his paintings . I don 't understand . He 's been gone a few weeks . Then I came back . Isaac . I 'm waiting for the shock to clear , so I can tell if you 're glad to see me . Well , I 'm just gonna ... You look ... You look healthy . I got back a few days ago . I wasn 't sure when to call you . I was in a clinic . I ... I barely remember any of it , but when I woke up I was in Texas and I was clean . That 's great . I mean it . I don 't need the drugs anymore . I can paint without it . Well , I 'm glad for you . I 'm only alive because of you , Simone . I still love you . AII right , this painting , it 's like he 's exploding , Iike he 's a bomb . How did you know about this ? Did you talk to my brother Peter ? I painted what I saw . Well , the Iast thing Peter said before he collapsed was that he was the cause of the explosion . Look , I may not get everything . That 's fine . But this ... I mean , these things can 't be connected . And the world doesn 't work like this . Mr. Isaac , bad news . Sword not there . It was replica . Original owned by a man named Linderman . Did he say Linderman ? flying man ! " Save the cheerleader , save the world . " What does that even mean ? Have I been saved , or do I still need saving ? You 're saved for the time being . I want to talk to Peter Petrelli . You 're not supposed to remember Peter Petrelli . He 's being watched . If you try to contact him , your father will know . You have to give me something . Nothing in my Iife has been real . My dad obviously doesn 't work in a paper factory . I don 't know what he does . And what about my biological parents ? He didn 't find them through the adoption agency , did he ? They work for your father , Iike I do . Everything has been a lie . The only person I could trust was Zach , and you took him from me . That was your father 's doing , not mine . Then give him back his memories . I don 't want to be alone . You are not alone , claire . And I cannot give your friend back his memories . It 's not how my gift works . Your gift ? Is that what you call it ? What do you call it ? My own private freak show . What you can do , what I can do , that is God . Respect it accordingly . The bomb , it comes from the street , destroys everything . Everything turns into dust , poof ! Your English is a Iot better . I met a waitress in Texas . She teach me many things . Good for you . So , look , I can 't believe I 'm about to say this . You teleported here back from the future ? Yes , my power let me come back here . So I can stop it . ( IMITATING JAPANESE ACCENT ) Right , because you hero ? You will help , too . Me ? What makes you so sure ? You are flying man . ( WHOOSHING ) Would you keep it down ? ( WHOOSHING QUIETLY ) What do you think it is that makes this bomb thing go off ? Don 't know . Probably bad guy ? Bad guy ? Yes , Iike billain . What 's that ? Billain . Billain ? Billain . Villain . Vvv ... Vvv ... Villain . Like the guy in the painting ? You think a human being could actually cause an explosion ? I have power . You have power . Maybe he has power , too . Bad guy . We must stop him . I think I can help . ( WIND HOWLING ) ( PANTING ) We 've been here before . You , me , the video camera . Is it at all familiar ? What are you doing ? Auditioning for America 's Next Top Model ? You made that joke the first time . Look , just keep the camera on me , okay ? Well , why don 't you just use a tripod ? I can 't do this by myself . And I know you can keep a secret . You did . You did until you forgot what it was . When we were best friends ? You ready ? claire , hold on a second . I 'm sure you told me this before , but why are we videotaping this ? Whatever this is ? Actually , I didn 't tell you that before . The first time I did this , I did it to show my parents . My real parents . I wanted them to see what I was . I thought they could help me understand . But I don 't think I 'm ever gonna meet them . They may not even be alive anymore . So why you want to tape it now ? For me . So I never forget what I am , no matter what happens to me . Just don 't freak out , okay ? I won 't . You said that last time . ( BEEPING ) The camera 's ready for whatever . Okay , I 'm ready . Keep the camera on me . What are you doing ? ( CLAIRE SCREAMING ) Oh , my God . Oh , my God , claire ! ( GRUNTING ) This is claire Bennet , and as far as you know , that was attempt number one . I don 't know how much longer I 'm gonna be here . Now , what is that supposed to mean ? ( GATE BUZZING ) They 're sending me to the psych ward for an evaluation with a shrink . She 's here . Jessica . She came out . She tried to escape . She hurt one of the guards . Maybe a shrink could help you deal with her . I mean , get rid of her . This isn 't in my head , D.L. She 's real . I should have never let you do this , Niki , get yourself thrown in here . I should have kept that money to help you out . No . You had to give it back or else this would never be over . Let me talk to Micah . I want you to come home . I know , sweetie , but I can 't . It 's hard to understand right now , but I hope that one day you will . You know , your daddy , he 's gonna take real good care of you while I 'm gone . I need you to be the strong one because I 'm not that strong right now , okay ? That 's not fair . That 's my son . Can I just give him a hug ? It 's just for a second , I promise . Baby , it 's all right . It 's all right . No , he needs me . He needs me . Just let me hold him . Stay right there . He needs me . I said stay there . please . I 'm warning you ! please . Just for a moment . ( GATE BUZZING ) MAN : Go , move ! Wait ! I just want to see my son ! Against the wall ! Mom ! I just wanted to see my son . MAN : Your hands . Easy . I don 't even know what she fed you . They eat crickets . Lots of crickets . You ? I hope you don 't mind . I let myself in . Have you come to kill me , now ? That depends . I 'd Iike to talk to you about Eden . She worked for me . Don 't you mean Sarah ellis ? She gave up that name and that life a Iong time ago , and she was a good person . Yes , of course , all spies are very good people , just misunderstood . She cared about you more than she should have . She was special . She had an ability ? What was it ? Suffice it to say , she learned how to use it wisely . Not everyone who has these abilities deserves them . And who are you to judge ? In fact , who are you , period ? I made a mistake . I should have come to you a Iong time ago . You 've been spying on me for weeks , in India , my cab , bugging my phone . We need to help each other , Dr. Suresh . And why would I help you ? You need me , don 't you ? My father , he knew more than you do . From what we can observe , yes . If you 've been watching , then you know my father 's formula doesn 't work . We both know that he generated a list . Who 's on that list is a matter of grave importance . You 've come for it ? You want to find them ? I 'm glad you seem so worried . Are you on the list ? You no doubt realize things can go terribly wrong with these abilities . If you work with me we can control that . If , and when , I do figure out this list , the first thing I 'm going to do is warn these people about you . Together , we could actually make a difference . Sorry , not interested . Contact me when you change your mind . The access number is on the back . Are you back ? Yeah . I took out that suitcase this morning but I haven 't packed it yet . I know that we 're in trouble . And I know that a Iot of it is my ... Most of it is my fault . Janice , we need to start being completely honest with each other . Come clean about everything . Okay . 'Cause there 's something I 've gotta tell you . Something has happened to me . Something that 's really hard to explain . Just say it . I can hear people 's thoughts . Meaning what ? I hear their thoughts , what they 're thinking . It started a few weeks ago . That 's why I 've been with the F.B.I. all this time . Well , what do you mean , Iike a psychic or something ? I don 't know . I guess . You can 't be serious . Yeah . You don 't believe me . Okay , that 's alright . Here , come here , come here , come here , come here . AII right , pick a number between one and a million . ( GIGGLING ) Come on , bring it on . ( LAUGHING ) I took his power , Nathan . I can 't control it . Let me help you , Peter . I can 't . I 'm not leaving you . No ! ( SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( PANTING ) Ma , where is he ? I have no idea . He woke up . He woke up ? Yes , he was raving . After two weeks spent sitting at his bedside thinking he could die , he says he 's got to get away . You just let him leave ? No , I just did not let him leave , and when I see him I will kill him . Mom , all right , look , just go home , okay ? Get some rest . I 'II take care of it . You 're really Hiro Nakamura from Isaac 's comic book ? I work there , at Yamagata . And we fly here , and we drive that car everywhere . blue Nissan Versa . It 's parked outside right now . I 'm just like Mr. Isaac draw me , except my face not so round . Okay . Yeah . I give up . The world is insane . I 'm not gonna keep fighting it . You can paint the future . And he needs a sword . This guy , Linderman , he 's a client of mine , a huge collector . He buys every painting of Isaac 's he can . I can get you in there . Get your car . You 're going back to Vegas . Yeah , I need the first flight out of New York into the desert . I don 't know . Nevada , maybe ? That 's where they did all those nuclear bomb tests , right ? Okay . Yeah , Las Vegas . Las Vegas is good . That ... Yeah , whatever . Yeah , I 'II hold . ( LAUGHING ) Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! What are you doing ? Hey ! You can see me ? You ? ( GRUNTING ) Nobody sees me ! Do you hear me ? Nobody sees me . I 'm invisible . MOHINDER : In the beginning , there was discovery . A confusion of elements . The first snowfall of impossible change . Old lives undone , left behind . Strange faces , made familiar . New nightmares to challenge sleep . New friends to feel safe with . Only then comes control . The need to impose order onto chaos . Through determination , through study , through struggle . She 's gonna be okay . You know that , right ? You 'd tell me the truth , right ? MOHINDER : All in defiance of a thundering truth . They 're here , and the Earth shudders underfoot . Oh , God . MAN : Lights out . please help me . JESSICA : Who needs God when you 've got me ?

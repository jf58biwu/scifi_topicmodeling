 JACK : Previously on Kings ... Father 's birthday is days away . Days in which a thousand things go wrong unless managed with attention . Pay attention , boys . Your father died fighting for this . Welcome home , Son . This time things will be different , I trust ? We give up what we want when we want power . It can 't be like it was , Joseph . I can 't . But I Iove you . When I was a Iittle girl , I was very sick . And the doctors told me I wouldn 't get better . Your daughter takes chances with her life as if it wasn 't hard won . I owe you the truth . I 'm promised to someone else . I 'm sorry . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) SILAS : Thank you . Happy birthday , sir . A gun from an ally . Now , is that a gift or an invitation to a duel ? A gift . I know better than to rankle a Silas with a gun in his hand . ( LAUGHING ) Thank you . Happy birthday , sir . Thank you , Hanson . AII this open access to you , sir ... At least let us pre-screen first . I will not take cover every time a threat is made by some quacking Ioon . You had a death threat made against you this morning . It 's the least we can do . Well , there must be a way of doing less , hmm ? You invite more guards if you wish . Have you reconsidered inviting Andrew ? William was hoping ... My birthday , my list . I will endure a party in the company of my choosing . But with none that sour the wine in my cup . Thank you . Mmm-hmm . ROSE : I 'm sorry , William . He still says no . We 're running late . We should go . You know , I never much liked parties before . But it might be nice to be royalty again . I honestly never thought that Aunt Rose would ever associate with me again in public . ( SIGHS ) I was thinking maybe we shouldn 't go . With my schedule , a night out is a rare thing . Why waste it in the company of so many empty people when you and I can catch up ? Have dinner together . You still like steak ? I wasn 't invited , was I ? ( CHUCKLES ) Of course you were . We 're family . You don 't have to be mad on my account . Most people don 't want me around . You should go . I have my reading to do . plans have changed .

But shows appreciation for the effort . And who is this ? You remember Lucinda Wolfson . She 's making an honest man of me . Well , with a face like that , how could she not ? How long have you two been seeing each other ? Thank you . Happy birthday , sir . Oh . JACK : Find us some drinks , would you ? Usefully quiet . And a Wolfson . She 's a Iittle out of her depth , but we can fix that . Well-chosen , Jack . Happy birthday , sir . It used to be you 'd see me and head towards me . I 'm trying to respect your wishes . You 're promised to someone else . What am I supposed to do ? David . The world doesn 't just stop because we want to be together . We ? ( GLASS CLINKS ) You need to go . You should go ahead . AII right , everyone . The birthday boy ! ( GUESTS APPLAUDING ) Come . Me ? Hmm ? Say something . Oh , I hate public speaking . ( GUESTS LAUGHING ) To get old is a terrible thing . We should do it in reverse , so that we can appreciate the strength . The only consolation in the creaks and the limited range of vision is that we don 't endure it alone . GUESTS : Aw . So , I see ... Well , well , almost see . ( GUESTS LAUGHING ) Friends ! Family . blessings . Oh , there have been days . And this , this is one of those days . I feel that strength . My heart is filled with richly oxygenated blood from experience . And my mind is clear . ( GUESTS EXCLAIMING ) Good timing . To our city ! To our people ! May we all grow old together ! ( GUESTS TOASTING ) ( GUESTS EXCLAIMING ) ( ALL CHATTERING ) Ah ! Happy birthday . On his birthday ? The blackout covers the full city through the entire south land . None of our enemies are claiming responsibility . The entire grid shut down . Power , communications , Iand , and cellular . We ask the world to watch our skies and offer them a display of our humiliation . Cause ? Not cause , not source . Eight power plants were ordered serviced simultaneously , creating a demand spike . And how did you manage to have eight power plants serviced simultaneously ? A clerical error . Mmm-hmm ? I 'd Iike to meet this cleric . Hmm ? Every minute the lights stay down powers rumors of our impotence and tempts opportunists . Just get the lights on . There 's a switch somewhere . flip it . It 's like a blanket over the city . Let 's go see . You know what this is ? This is time stopped . This is permission . For what ? For us . This is our chance . Should we take it ? Sir . You should hear this . PFC Chris Beals . The man issuing your death threats over Port Prosperity . He was just seen outside altar Mansion . Service went after him , but he eluded capture . Headed east , towards the river . They said they saw him armed . THOMASINA : Taking advantage of the blackout . And the Princess , sir . She 's not here . Was he following her ? IVAN : We don 't know . I passed out pictures of him . AII are on highest alert . We 'II find her . We have every available man on it . Is the power back on ? HANSON : No . Sir ? Then why is there music ? Sir ? ABNER : Gath has unveiled a hundred new armored divisions . Calls them Goliaths . Range doubles ours . They amass at the demilitarized zone . SCHOLAR : Another sneak attack in the plains of Dan left 36 casualties . One more of the wounded just airlifted in . Critical and in the balance . FAWKES : If we counter , it will only cause Gath 's escalation . We 'II provoke a new war . What news of my daughter ? No updates , sir . As she was an hour ago . An hour ago , she was not well . ( DOOR CLOSING ) You have run his court since it began , Chancellor Scholar . You know when his moods are foul . Dark . You fear as I do . My daughter 's illness has left him unable . ( WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA ) He 's hurt badly . We don 't know . He can hear you . Come tell him that you 're here . Let your father know you 're praying . It 's not fair . I know . We weren 't supposed to be fighting anymore . Why did they attack us ? Why did Dad have to be there ? Come on . Let 's go see him . SILAS : The ANC . Too low . She 's severely anemic . Well , try something else . Her blood and bone marrow are overwhelmed . She 's strong . She 'II survive another treatment . Sir ... There 's nothing left , but to spend time . She 's looking better . In less pain . This treatment 's working . I 'm sorry , sir . It 's not . No ! She doesn 't lose tonight . Beautiful Princess , friend to elves and maker of music in the meadow with nothing but her hair . Dad , I 'm not five . You 're four . You 're two . Eyes that light up the beltway . You look strong . Look what I brought you . " Harlow . " Hmm . I thought we were doing the classics . You know the classics better than any professor . You 've read this a hundred times . Well , what 's one more time ? Harlow , Several Dumplings and the Sabbath Queen . Mmm-hmm ? Right . " She knew she was meant for school , for book things and pencil time . " And yet ... " " And yet , Harlow found herself veering left , not right , " where she knew the schoolhouse still sat . " And with that confidence , she dropped her books " and took her first step into the dark . " The Sabbath Queen . " THOMASINA : Nothing yet on the Princess , ma 'am . IVAN : We 've posted lookouts all around the city . We 're checking everywhere we know . Everyone we have , on the street . I want her back here safe now . IVAN : I 'II coordinate with city police . We 'II pull palace guard and remaining service . Everyone . I 'm talking about a whole houseful of guests standing around , doing nothing . I want her back safe now ! ( GUITAR PLAYING ) DAVID : Are we allowed to dance ? ( CHUCKLES ) Last time we danced , you didn 't know how . Last time we danced , I was very nervous . I was wearing a tux for the first time . I thought you hated me . I just didn 't know what to think . People like you aren 't supposed to exist . Uh , someone could see . No , they can 't . Not a Princess . Just a girl in the dark . Who can do anything she wants . JACK : Princess . Princess . Nope . ( DOGS BARKING ) Not her , either . ( CHUCKLES SOFTLY ) ( SIGHS ) You 're him , right ? You going to freak out on me ? The lights are down . Be anyone you want . Jack ? Jack ! Jack ! Jack ! SILAS : If you 're not here to tell me you 've found her , keep looking . I 'm not leaving you here alone , sir . Oh , unless you doubt I know how to use this ? Silas .

( THUDDING ) WOMAN : ( WHISPERING ) Silas . The Sabbath Queen . SILAS : " ' No , you cannot go home , ' ruled the Sabbath Queen . " ' You 'II stay here until you die , and after . ' " Not for the first time , Harlow began to worry " if she would ever get back to her mother and homework ever again . " You 've been reading me Harlow for days , and somehow , we never get to the end . I 'm a thief and a cheater . You don 't want to end it . You don 't want things to finish . Only beginnings with you . I just ... What ? ( PIANO PLAYING ) MICHELLE : Are you okay ? You ask me ? I 'II start again . Shouldn 't we finish it ? There 's time for that . Is there ? They say no . But you know better ? I do . What do you know ? You live forever . ( SIGHING ) I thought I would win this time . What can I do ? I don 't know . Can I pray ? I 've never stopped praying .

( WOMAN LAUGHING IN DISTANCE ) ( BOTH LAUGHING ) One night together , and you decide to bring me here ? I 've always loved this house . We used to come here in the summers and there were no press or cameras allowed . My mom let me wear shorts . You know , most girls , they grow up wanting to be princesses . You 're the only Princess who wants to be a regular girl . You know , the caretaker 's house is miles away . We 're completely alone . We could have been alone back in the city . Yeah . But then , I couldn 't have shown you this . Your favorite painting ? No , I hated this . It used to give me nightmares . I had my first kiss here . Hmm . I was twelve , and there was a party on the lawn for Jack . And I was standing here staring at this , trying to convince myself that I could look at it without getting scared . And failing . And someone came and kissed me . Not very romantic . Not at all . Was it a good one ? Not at all . My first kiss . Stolen . Wasted . You know , my whole life has been planned out and scored in perfect four-four time by forces larger than myself . It 's okay . I accept it . AII the disappointments and wasted moments to come . I won 't have any regrets about anything . Except for this one wasted memory . I would have that back . I would have you in the thief 's place . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) HANSON : Ma 'am ? What news , Chancellor ? Unity reports slow going restarting the main plants servicing Shiloh . ( STUTTERING ) The King feared so . He wants the transformer from our plant at Pella brought to the main station north of Shiloh . Then have them trigger a black start . He also wants an account of that blackout 's cause . That surge . We 've already got that , ma 'am . Energy Ministry traced it to a single location . Switchboard failure at the manufacturing plant at New Carmel . And what company owns that plant ? CrossGen , ma 'am . DOCTOR : We 're lucky she lasted this long . There 's been severe organ failure . She 's not coming back . ( SILAS READING ) " ' No , you cannot go home , ' ruled the Sabbath Queen . " ' You stay here until you die and after . ' " Even while deciding her fate , " Harlow thought the Sabbath Queen had eyes as blue as any sky " or sea or fruit stain she 'd ever seen . " Not for the first time , Harlow began to worry " if she would ever get back to her mother or homework ever again . " SCHOLAR : Ma 'am . Chancellor Scholar . I was looking for him . He 's still here . Yes . He 's ... He 's always here . You 've seen what I have . You alone know the King is not the King . Gath threatens war . Attack or retreat ? Security demands decision . The country waits on his rule . Then the country shall have it . It 's over . Let it be done . Tell her it 's it 's okay . Tell her she can rest . ( PIANO PLAYING ) ( GROANING ) WOMAN : Finish the book . ( PIANO PLAYING ) You . You make the music that drives me mad . A gift . Others meet me in silence . Out of deference to those who love you , I give warning . You came for her . You cannot have her . Can 't I ? I was chosen by him who made you and all things . Leave us . You and your music . You can 't threaten me . He made death even outside his reach . You like to see us suffer . It is beautiful to see . Yours most of all . I come to you sometimes , Silas . I Iook at you . Then make me suffer more . Give me pain . Endless . Endless pain . Name the knife . DEATH : For this life , I would see you lose what you love more . Your crown . It 's yours . Not for me . Who then ? Anyone ? Not anyone . To the better man . When he 's found , when he comes , you stand aside . Yes . Willingly , freely . You support his succession . else I come for you . And you 'II live to see your name be cursed . Forgotten . Yes . Swear it , before all . Ever more . Seal the contract . DEATH : You 'II wish I 'd taken her . You 'II beg to change now . Contract sealed . ( WILLIAM EXCLAIMING ) Rose . Look . A party everyone 's invited to . Because he was left off a guest list ? " Beluga . " You want some of this ? It will only spoil . ( LAUGHING ) Shutting down a city for want of an invitation . It 's a party . He 's my son . You 've done worse for yours . You insist on keeping Andrew in the cold . You 'd better learn to live in the dark . You have no idea what you 're dealing with . Turn the lights back on , William . No . He needs to Iearn . And so do you . You 're my brother . But I swear I will have your head . ABNER : More bombings from Gath . They destroyed our front lines . We cannot wait and do nothing . Yet Silas does not come . We will not declare war without him . The King remains in meditation on the question of war or not war . I bring you his answer . And I pray with you on his wisdom . " Our hearts armor heavy , " our grief , hot as the fire we must bring . " And we must . " To war ... " ... and not lightly . " And the rest , this is not for me . ( CLEARS THROAT ) " We launch against Gath at sunrise . " Our army shall seize the north " as we cut Gath off from the sea , " to leave its war machine parched and in ruins . " So writes our King . ( BLEEPING ) ( CLICKING ) ( LAUGHING ) What ... Stop it . What are you doing ? I thought there were no cameras allowed in the Royal vineyard estates . ( CHUCKLES ) Give it to me . You look so beautiful . Keep going . Really ? Keep going . ( BLEEPS ) ( GLASS SHATTERING ) SILAS : Anybody there ? Rose ? ( DOOR OPENING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( WHISPERING ) Silas . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) DAVID : You 're gorgeous . You 're filthy . Could you imagine if your father saw these ? Ugh . He 'd have my head . No , he 'd have worse . I 'II delete these . Don 't worry . Don 't . You should keep them . To remember . You were once this happy . Just tell me who . David . If I lose you to someone , tell me before I read about it in some newspaper . ( SIGHS ) Some alliance ? Something to help your father expand his empire ? It 's not him . It 's a promise I made . It 's my vow . I don 't understand . Who are you promised to ? Who are you supposed to marry ? No one . Ever . ( STUTTERING ) I was dying . By all measures , gone . I swear I could feel my last breath coming . I could smell death in the room . I prayed to God . And I said , " Give me one more breath . " And I 'II give it right back . " Let me have another after that and I will give it back again . " From now on , every breath you give me , I 'II use it to serve you . " To live for you . For your work . " ( GASPS ) And he listened . MICHELLE : From this day forward , I 'II earn this gift . Helping others , not myself . Witness , as I swear . Oh , stop . Your debt is paid . I Iive in service for him . For them . For no happiness of my own . For no man . I beg you , don 't do this . As you live you cannot let me waver . Promise me . Michelle . Promise me . I promise you . How can I compete with God ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Where are you ? Show yourself . ( CLATTERING ) DEATH : ( WHISPERS ) Silas . Hmm ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Sir . There you are . Somebody 's in the house . Stay here . I 'II clear the north wing . ( GUNSHOTS ) ( MAN SCREAMING ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) ( PIANO PLAYING ) ( VOICES CHATTERING ) You come for me in my house . I 'm ready . You hear me ? I 'm ready . Come to me . Now ! I 'm ready . ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) ( PHONE RINGING ) ANDREW : Hello , Aunt Rose . ROSE : You brought the lights back on . I reversed his order in his name . He 'II be furious with me , but not for long . I thought you could use the help . I 'd rather live in the dark than owe you a thing . ( DISCONNECTS ) JOSEPH : You have to go ? The lights are on . Just tell me so I know . Was it real ? You 're the only real thing I ever touched . You 've made God into my enemy . It would kill me if that were true . ( CHUCKLES ) I finally fall in love . And he takes you from me . You love me ? I do . I Iove you . Everyone keeps saying they know what God wants from us . I don 't know which of the voices in my head at night is his . God didn 't save your life so you could pretend you died . He saved it so you could live . You think he wants this ? How does God not want love ? My father can 't know . ROSE : I 'II send for the doctor . You all right , Father ? Yeah . Yeah . I 'm so sorry I lost you . I was looking for you . I 'm glad you 're safe . THOMASINA : Sir . You 're hurt . It 's nothing . Where were you ? ( STUTTERING ) It was a beautiful night out . I wanted to see the city . Luckily , I had a friend who wouldn 't let me go alone . He kept me safe . A friend ? A friend . And a gentleman . Thank you . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) I thought you bargained me away . If I die , I die with you . ROSE : The doctor says it 's a miracle . And how is the King ? ( PIANO PLAYING ) The piano . Then my mind is clear . Your daughter recovers . We are blessed . Doubly . We have back our King . Thank God . You did well for us in difficult times . You should be rewarded . Lands in the countryside , I think . One of our ranches . You take your family and finally spend the time with them they deserve . You 're dismissing me ? No one can ever know the King broke with greatness . ( MUSIC CONTINUES ) ( STOPS PLAYING ) Sir , sorry . My ... My father died . Death took what was near . What is that piece ? I don 't know . Just something he taught me . And now he 's gone . You play well for him . play on . ( PLAYING )

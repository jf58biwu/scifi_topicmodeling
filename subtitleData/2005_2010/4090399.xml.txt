Can you run ? Okay . Keep on running . Don 't look back . Enough ! Enough ! soldier ! Stand down ! no ! Ready ! Aim ! Wake me when it 's over . Fire ! My name is Major William Stryker . You were sentenced to death for decapitating a senior officer . Is that correct ? Apparently we have some issues with authority . Just keep a lid on it . Sir . The warden tells me that your sentence was carried out ... by a firing squad at 1000 hours . - How 'd that go ? - It tickled . You boys tired of running ? Tired of denying your ... true nature ? I care ... I care cause I know how special you are ... how valuable . Look . locked up like freaks of nature ... or you can join me . I 'm putting together a special team ... with special privileges . Now tell me ... How would you like to really serve your country ? I love this weapon more than anything in the whole wide world . - You wanna know why ? - No . It 's memorable . to have to get ' em on a plane . You whip out a couple of swords ... at your ex-girlfriend 's wedding ... ever forget it . Wade . I didn 't think you liked girls . it is ... it 's probably not as intimidating as having a gun or ... bone claws or the fingernails of a bag lady ... - Manicure ? - Victor ... easy . Fred got a new tattoo . I 'm concerned . you just met her last night . - I love her . - You love her after one night ? She 's a gymnast . take her down .

Brings out the seriousness in your eyes . pal ? not when I 'm awake . please . Cover the elevator ! The elevator ! Time to go to work . Okay ! People are dead ! Wade ... you 'd be the perfect soldier . they 're yours . I don 't want your diamonds . I want this . That ? That is nothing . A souvenir . Where did you find it ? I want the source . three days from here . Tell him that this rock is more valuable to me than his life . Ask him where he found it . He says it came from the sky . He 's telling the truth . Logan . It 's a meteor fragment . I know what it is . I 'm asking him where he found it . base wants to know our location . Shut him down . Tell him everyone here will die ... unless he tells me where he found the rock . fine . Victor ... Victor ! Don 't even think about it ! We didn 't sign up for this . Put him down . What are you doing ? We finally got a good thing going here . Don 't you screw this up . it 's enough . We 've done enough . Who do you think you are ? This is what we do . Maybe you 'd rather be rotting in a hole somewhere is that it ? Uh ? I 'm done . You coming ? Jimmy ! We can 't just let you walk away ! Jimmy ! Jimmy ! Why are you up so early ? Come here . See you baby . that 's nice ! Yeah ! No . Come on . what do you do ? you win a prize . I wanna do it ! that 's obvious . That 's two . man . C 'mon . Bye ! Show 's over ! show 's over ! Bradley . - Victor . - Aren 't you gonna invite me in ? come on in . I 've never said anything ... to anyone ... about what happened . but uh ... No need to bring up the past . I always thought it would be Wade coming knocking at my door . Wade 's gone . Victor . I 'm not afraid to die . How do you know ? You 've never tried it before . Was it the wars ? - Which one ? - All of ' em . Tell me . It 's just a scratch . baby . Yeah ... Who the hell is this ? It smells like government . My God ! Haven 't aged a day ! Clean living . You remember Agent Zero . Still shooting first and asking questions later ? You still chewing those cheap cigars ? please . I have a job for you . - I already have a job . - Lumberjack . - Eighteen grand a year ? - Eighteen five . Plus I haven 't had to kill anyone in a while . right now I am . back to the car . Attaboy . I 'm not proud about the way things ended between us . Conversation 's over . Play the little house on the prairie with a ... a school teacher . Logan . huh ? I would . Stryker ? Bradley was killed three days ago . before that . I believe that someone is hunting down our whole team . Anyone else ? Victor is safe . addresses ... - I can take care of myself . Logan . Country needs you . I am Canadian . Logan ! I know who you are ! What 's wrong ? Stryker came by today . I said no . Why is he bothering you after all these years ? Because I 'm the best there is at what I do . And what I do best isn 't very nice . Logan . What you have is a gift . A gift ? You can return a gift . fellas ! - Stay in the car . - I 'm just gonna ask nicely . Mind letting ' us go by ? pal ? Are ya ? Just move your truck so we can go by ... right . If you start something ... you 'd better be ready to finish it . take it easy ! Your boyfriend 's got a big mouth . I know . let us pass . Thank you ! How did you do that ? power of persuasion is a gift . have those powers over me ? did you ? Why is the moon so lonely ? Why ? Because she used to have a lover . - You tell this to the kids ? - No . His name was Kuekuatsheu ... and they lived in the spirit world together . it 's a true story . - Right . they would wander the skies together . But ... one of the other spirits was jealous . so he told Kuekuatsheu that the moon had asked for flowers . He told him to come to our world ... and pick up some wild roses ... But Kuekuatsheu didn 't know ... that once you leave the spirit world ... you can never go back . he looks up in the sky ... and sees the moon and howls her name . But he can never touch her again . Koo-koo-Kachooka got screwed . Kuekuatsheu . Means the Wolverine . Logan ? Kayla ! are you ? What gave me away ? You got an insurance in this place ? Insurance ? No . Too bad . well ... Look what the cat dragged in . take it outside . - Why ? - Why ? you don 't write . How else am I supposed to get your attention ? James . I 'm a little disappointed . Stay down . was she worth it ? When are you gonna figure it out ? We are not like them . I ... am nothing like you . Sure you are . You just don 't know it yet . - What do we got ? - Bar fight . Multiple knife wounds . What ? Is this a joke ? The guy 's fine . Where is he ? I said where is he ! I don 't know who he is . I can help you . Six years I 've been here . No one knew me and then you show up . she 's dead ! - I tried to warn you . Why don 't you tell me it was Victor ? I didn 't know . I swear on my son 's life ! I didn 't ... Victor 's appetites were becoming too public . I had to lock him up . He thought I 'd betrayed him . Went AWOL . He said he was coming after all of us . You didn 't come to warn me . You came to save your own ass . captain ? you know you can 't . I 'm gonna find him and kill him . I can give you the tools to defeat him . right ? I promise you two things : but you 'll have your revenge . I 'm coming for blood . no code of conduct . You point me in the right direction and you get the hell out of my way . focus on that . Maybe it will help . I 've been through worse . you haven 't . We are ready . We 're gonna make you indestructible . we 're gonna have to destroy you . Remember what we were looking for in Africa ? I remember . I found it . It helped us create a ... metal compound so strong that you will be able to withstand virtually anything . It 's called Adamantium . Logan . you 're gonna have to embrace the other side . Become the animal . Let 's do this . I almost forgot . I want new ones . What do you want them to say ? Wolverine . Generals ! Welcome . General Munson . we 're gonna witness medical history . we 're gonna create Weapon X. - X ? Ten . We are about to begin bonding Adamantium to Weapon X 's skeleton . Let 's begin . Jimmy . - Logan ! Body temperature is 1-0-8 and rising . Why is he thrashing like that ? Why isn 't he sedated ? just like the rest of us . Anaesthesia won 't work on him . That 's why he had to volunteer . 195 . - Will he survive this ? - I don 't know . 200 . ... son . Heartbeat 's well beyond maximum . - Blood pressure ? - 260 on 180 . he can make it . Victor ! I love you . Logan . It means ... the Wolverine . I guess he can die . old friend . Come back . Heart rate rising . Adamantium reservoir is depleted . No rejection . Procedure completed . We did it ! We take him to the island ? The island ? No . The bonding works . We use his DNA for the XI . Erase his memory . Fry his brain ! I think he heard you . Lockdown ! Hunt him down . Take his head off . Travis ! I think there is some naked man in the barn . Yep . Son ... What in hell are you doing ? - It 's cold . - Cold ? - You got no clothes on . - Yeah . are you ? No . You just had a rough night . you could say that . Come on up the house . Some of my son 's old clothes will probably fit you . cover it up with that . I don 't want to give an old lady a heart attack . You 're right in there ? everything 's fine . Supper 's on the table . I 'll be there in a minute . I swear I 'm gonna pay for it . Set it down over there . son . I can 't thank you both enough ... for everything . It wouldn 't have been decent to leave you out there to freeze . - Decent ... - What ? I 'm just not really used to that word . That 's a nice chopper you 've got out there . You know motorcycle ? here we go ! My favorite is a ' 48 Panhead . I bought one new off the line . son . You must be exhausted . You get a good night 's sleep . In the barn . Nothing you can break out there . I love you . - Why is the moon so lonely ? - Why ? Because she used to have a lover . He can never touch her again . You sleep ok ? Uh ... yeah . You look like a man fixing to do a bad thing . You know what happens to many looking for blood ? - What ? - They find it . mine got taken . Bullshit . This was my son 's jacket . Try it on . - Thank you . - Yep ... test the suspension . huh ? you 're heavy . I put on a little weight recently . Good morning . Good morning . it fits you beautifully ! I brought you some ... Weapon X is in the barn . He just murdered two civilians . Blow him to bits . Let 's see if he can survive that . Fire at will . Come and get me ! Blow his head up . Damn ! do not lose him ! target 's coming to you ! Pull up ! Pull up ! is Logan dead ? come in ! Did you get him ? I 'm down . come in ! You tried to kill me . Logan ? Where is Victor ? Come back to base . we 'll take Victor down together . Wrong answer . I 'm coming for you . listen to me . you 're not gonna like what you find . Colonel ? You got it . Those were good people back there . Innocent people . It 's funny how good innocent people tend to die around you . Zero never stood a chance . The only thing that 'll take him down is an Adamantium bullet This facility is compromised . Prep transport . this is turning into a disaster . we 'll stop him . - Really ? You 've just spent half a billion dollars ... making him indestructible . - Sir ? - Yes . we found him . Logan isn 't the only piece in this puzzle . I need to evacuate this facility . go back to Washington . We 've got work to do . el habla ? Somebody translate ? Summers ? Sit up and take off those glasses . I have a headache . Then you can wear them in detention after school while you add up this conjugation 100 times . Somebody else ? He talks . he talks . El habla . - You sure it was Victor ? - Yeah . Damn ! mate . What the hell happened to him after I left ? He got worse . He felt like you abandoned him . we all do . he had to prove you he was better than you . Hunting and killing everything 's he was pointin ' at . couldn 't take rounding them up . - Rounding who up ? - Leave it alone . John ? John ! Logan . There 's a special place in hell for the things we did . Mutants ? Why ? Stryker 'd say we would make a difference . Protecting people from the bad ones . Logan ? Remember that stuff in Africa ? what about it ? Damn ! What 'd they do to you ? Don 't ask . Zero said something about an island . Does that mean anything to you ? Nope . But maybe Dukes knows . - Him and Zero were real tight . - Fred Dukes ? - Where is he ? - He 's here . let 's go talk to him . - Hold on . He don 't get in until around four . But I gotta warn you ... he developed a bit of eating disorder . We all got our coping mechanisms . I 'm trying to whoop him back into shape . man . I told him he got to move . Fred Dukes ? Trapped inside that creature ? That ain 't Fred . Logan . um . huh . Logan . You know where Victor is ? No idea . slim ? Logan . I ain 't gonna leave until you tell me where Victor is . huh ? Did you just call me ... Blob ? but ... I told you not to mention his weight . Why did you call him Blob ? I said Bob ! Goddamn it ! I got an idea . Logan . and you know it . The feeling is mutual . dance with him a little bit . Allow him to let his anger out on you . I figure if you do that ... he might tell you everything you wanna know . look at him . Big old ass comin ' out of the front of his shirt . he 's gonna have a coronary for Christ 's sake . Is there even a stretcher big enough ... to take this guy out of here ? It ain 't him I 'm worried about getting out on a stretcher . You 're an asshole . Whoop his ass ! - Let me have it . - If you want . Be careful with this . You wanna dance with me ? that feels good . guess what ? man . You got him right where you want him . Whose side are you on anyway ? where is Victor ? don 't you think ? please ! Victor ! Where 's Victor ? Victor 's ... with Stryker on ... on the island ... they ... they run it together . What ... what ? Victor 's being with Stryker ? Yeah . You didn 't know that ? I trust you can handle that . didn 't I ? you did that . right ? Of course . Captain . What 's the island ? It 's where ... Striker takes them after Victor 's caught ' em . what ? Takes who ? Mutants . The rumor is that Stryker 's doing experiments on them there . you never wondered what happened to them ? I tried not to . They killed her ... so I 'd let them put Adamantium in me . They killed her for a goddamn experiment . Where is it ? Stryker kept it real secret . But ... - A prisoner escaped there once . - Who ? His name is Remy LeBeau . He was a street hustler from New Orleans . The guards at the prison called him Gambit because he kept taking all their money at poker ... that 's all I know . what 's the end game ? trying to combine them somehow . Logan . It 's all I know . I 'm gonna take your head off . Logan . - There 's no redemption where I 'm going . - I ain 't asking . There 's our dude . That 's cool . But I 'm gonna gonna go and cover the back if he runs . I 'm not havin a fight with him . - Yeah right . - What ? I am havin ' fights with everybody ? Don 't dogs kill cats ? will ya ? Are you Remy LeBeau ? Do I owe you money ? No . Then Remy LeBeau I am . and the small blind 's 50 . May I deal you in ? Now what can I get for 17 bucks ? 17 dollars ? perhaps . John ? Victor . And your creepy black coat don 't scare me . Really ? It worked on Dukes . 'cause now I 'm gonna kill you ... so Logan never gets the chance . sir ? Victor Creed . And who 's that ? The man I 'm gonna kill . on an island . - I just need to know where it is . - Why would you think I know that ? Gambit . You are the guy who escaped ... and you are the guy who 's gonna take me back there . John ... There 's something I always wanted to tell you . You 're predictable . Johnny Boy . That 's funny . I never knew you had one . sir . The men who took me wore tags just like ' em . you listen to me ... Two years I was rotting ' in that hell ... and I 'm never going back . shiny . Jimmy . Do you even know how to kill me ? I 'm gonna cut your goddamn head off . See if that works . old man . Son of a bitch . You 're gonna die for what you did to her . Victor ! That 's a nice stick . Shithead . Here 's the deal . pretty much everyone you hate in this world . Do you understand ? You really want to kill ' em . yeah . Colonel . General ? Is this Weapon XI ? All their strenghts but none of their weaknesses . don 't you ? I don 't hate them . After 20 years of working with them ... I just know what they can do . If we win this war before it starts ... and save countless lives in the process . General . The days of our country sitting on the sidelines are over . We need to take the fight to the enemy ... before they take the fight to us . I do . - Thank you . But this is as far as it goes . Weapon X was a ... a hickup . Bill . We know he 's a mutant . And we know he killed your wife . You shouldn 't have kept that from us . That ... That has nothing to do with my work . Bullshit . You 're too close to this . I 'm sure you know it . You 're right . I ... I won 't lie to you . My son did bring the problem home for me . But I took an oath ... to protect the American people both foreign ... and domestic . huh ? - I 'm fine . Just concentrate on what you 're doing . You sure ? You got a bit of sweat on your brow there . just keep your eyes on the ... On the what ? Clouds ? We 're jumpin ' up and down like a freakin ' yoyo here . Where did you get this thing anyway ? I won her in a game . - Jacks over fives . - Great . Relax . We 're almost there . There it is . The island . Three Mile Island . Hiding in plain sight . No one 's gonna sneak around a nuclear reactor . They think it 's gonna turn them into freaks . Like you ? Right . you ready ? Cause it 's now or never . Let 's go . About time . if it 's make you feel any better ... this is really gonna hurt . it kind of does actually . Good luck . Likewise . Oh shit . How are you doing ? Is everything alright ? - Is he ready yet ? - A few hours . He will respond to my commands ? Colonel . Logan . Welcome back to the war . I wanna know why . I needed your powers for the pool . For the what ? A mutant killer . The dead pool . to find him ... finding the right powers ... that can coexist in one body without ripping it apart . My son was the first piece of the puzzle . you are the last . You made Weapon XI possible . I ... I asked you to help but ... you said you wanted the quiet life . Well ... I 've learned that nothing motivates ... the men in your family like revenge . Who are you ? Oh she 's a real old friend . Do you really think we 'd just let you walk away ? You are a dangerous man . I like to keep an eye on dangerous men . Tell him about the day you died . They gave me a shot of hydrochloride thiazide . It reduces the heart rate so low ... it appears you flatline . Don 't be angry with her . Real credit ... to your species . Did you know that her sister ... has diamond-hard skin ? Kayla 's mutation is tacto-hypnosis . She can influence people as long as she touches them . Quite a useful tool in the seduction . my friend . It was real for me . I told you if you came down this road ... you wouldn 't like what you 'd found . That story you told me ... about man who gets flowers for the moon ... I had it backwards . I thought you were the moon and I was your Wolverine . aren 't you ? I am just the fool that got played . The worst part of this is I should have known . But I ignored my instincts . I ignored what I really am . that will never happen again . Kayla . I have done everything you 've asked . My sister ... you 'd let her go . it 's not as simple as that . Her mutation is unique . Quite beautiful . that 's all . You let him go ? please . - You can 't let him go . Victor . - Give me the Adamantium . - Tests came out ... - We had a deal ! You would never survive the operation . I can take anything he can . you can 't . Victor . time will come . He 's using us ! you die for real ? Let me go . Your mind game don 't work on me . Victor ! doesn 't it ? All that rage ... Do it . Logan ! You 're not an animal . you are . Do it . Finish it . Logan ? My sister . They have my sister . I didn 't trick you into believing me . It was real for me too . I 'm so sorry . They have my sister . Where is she ? Activate Weapon XI . The binding process is incomplete . Just do it ! Now ! Are you okay ? Come on . Okay ... Perfect . get these kids out of here . - Logan ... Find another way out . let 's go ! is that you ? I guess Stryker finally figured out how to shut you up . Wade ... You don 't have to do this . maybe you do . Shoot on sight ! I can help ! Point me at ' em ! Go ! Go ! Now ! Did I get them ? Yeah . - Let 's go . - I can 't go . come on ! I have to stay here . You take them . Go ! Go ! Go left . Left . - What ? - We go left . - You can 't see . - Trust me . C 'mon Bob ! Let 's see your dance up here . Nobody kills you but me . Back-to-back ! you don 't . Stop ! - This can 't be the way . - This is the way ! - How do you know ? - I just know . Come on . Adamantium bullets . Let 's see him heal with a few of these through his thick skull . You can 't stop him . Even with that . He 'll heal . His brain may heal . But his memories won 't grow back . Victor . We 're done . Jimmy . We 're brothers . Brothers look out for each other . - You miss me ? - Jesus ... When you said you 'd gonna kill everyone ... I thought you may just 've been exaggerating . Yeah ... Do I look like a man who exaggerates ? You 're welcome . These kids trying to get off the island . - Split up . Go ! - I 'm on it . Kayla ! Kayla ! I love you . No ... I am so cold . I 'm gonna get you outta here . You understand ? nice and easy . That 's it . That 's it . I 'm gonna get you out . Logan ! I should make you pull the trigger . But that would make us not better than you . Throw the gun away . Walk until your feet bleed . And then keep walking . Scott . My name is Charles Xavier . like you . - I can hear your thoughts . - Yes . And I can hear yours . You 're safe now . Come . We have to go . The kids are safe . What the hell happened ? who am I ? I 'm the guy who brought you here . Now we gotta go . Where the hell am I ? I am a friend . I 'm a friend . What 's my name ? What 's my name ! Your name is Logan . You need to trust me . We have to go . Follow me . Now ! Do you know her ? No . These dudes are not gonna like what you 've done in this place . We really need to go . I 'll find my own way . Good luck . Colonel Stryker ? - Colonel William Stryker ? - Yes . You 're wanted for questioning ... in connection of the death of General Munson . Sir .

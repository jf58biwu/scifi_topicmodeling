You 'll never get it through the door . Sure I will . Otherwise we 'll put it out here . It 's not worth worrying about . - What do you feel like for dinner ? - I don 't know . What have we got ?

I can 't get an outside line . You don 't have a cell ? There 's no coverage out here . - What is he doing ? - Walking . - In this direction ? - Yeah . he 'll know I 'm here . What should I do ? I don 't know ... Where are you ? In a laboratory . I blocked the door . come up here . It 's much safer . Where ? up the hill . And ... ? There 's a door down the hall on the right . Come up the hill . He 's coming from the other side of the house . I don 't think he 'll see you . he 'll find you . He 's getting closer . Get outof there . Get out of there ! - I 'm coming out . - Okay . That was me . Come up the path . Stay on it . the sooner I can turn off the lights . He shouldn 't see them . Where is he ? He 's approaching the house . What 's he doing ? I 'll guide you . He 's checking the windows . He 's seen the broken one . - Is he going in ? - Keep quiet . He 's going around the house . He 's seen the path . Hold on . Impossible . I 've lost the signal from one of the cameras . I 've lost another . Shit I can 't see anything ! I don 't know where he is ! Run ! turn off the lights . I see something on up there . Is that you ? it 's okay . I hear the car . It 's him ! He 's coming up ! Can he get in ? it 's okay . - Can you lock that ? - No . let 's go . - There 's nowhere else to go . We 're safe here . What is all this ? You can hide in there . What ? What is that ? Look . I can lower the hatch to hide you . Does this door have a lock ? Is there another door ? Another way out ? Can we turn off these damn lights ? He 'll never think to look in there . What about you ? I have to lower the hatch from here . I 'll activate it and get in with you . Okay . Come on ! Who are you ? What ? Who are you ? What ? - What did you do to me ? - I don 't know what you mean . You said you 'd get in with me . I said what ? right ? Was the tank full of white liquid ? right ? The liquid you 're soaked in ... That tank is still a prototype . It 's actually a ... right ? - Yeah . - And the fertilizer ? - Up there . Put it there . You went back in time . to call the police . wait . - Stay away from me . you can 't go home . What ? You 're already home . Want another look ? - They 're doing exactly what ... - Listen . 2006 . it can 't be . - What day did you think it was ? - I don 't know . and it was night already . So you only traveled ... a little while . a little while ? You 're not listening . You traveled in time . Into the past . That 's why you can see yourself . in your garden . So what do I do now ? How did you get in the machine ? okay ? - And suddenly ... - Don 't tell me . It 's better not to know details . You found me at the silo but you ... everything is solved . Why ? - All you have to do is wait . - Wait ... for what ? There 's nobody else here . Come on . What was your name again ? right . Who is the man in my home ? He 's you . - He 's me ? - Technically you 're the same person . He 's like your reflection . You 're looking in the mirror . Only this mirror shows what you were doing roughly about an hour ago . But that man is in my home . in the same way you did . How can I put this ? Come on . Excuse me . You want one ? No . Sit over there . okay ? But at this point you enter the tank and travel an hour and a half into the past . To here . You become a sort of Hector 2 . The one at your house - is Hector 1 . - Hector 1 ? you 're here . but there 's only one arrow . For how long ? Your reflection will last up to here . This is what we 'll do : Hide here . I 'll configure the tank in the basement and go up to the silo . I 'll have it ready and I 'll wait for nightfall . I 'll get him into the machine and send him to the past So here 's the deal . What deal ? I 'll bring everything back to normal and you won 't tell anyone about any of this . I shouldn 't be here . but I felt like staying . I 'm going up . Yes ? Hello ? Who is this ? What the fuck ... ? This is a restricted terminal . Record your message or give your access code . Right .. We got a call from this number . - What were you saying ? - Nothing . The phone rang . Who was it ? They didn 't say anything . But I got some weird machine . - Probably the workers . - What is this ? You called your house ? - Is today Saturday ? - I say lay low and you call your house ? - You can 't stop me . - Then what 's the point of having a phone ? - Did you talk to yourself ? - No . I called my house ... that 's it . Did you talk to yourself ? My wife is at home with that ... Look at him . Too weak to even argue . I have . Do you remember getting that call ? At your house ? Do you remember answering ? Yes . I got a call from myself . right ? I 'm going up to the silo . The tank needs to be filled . or lock you in the basement . it will be the end of your life as you know it . Shit . It 's still recording . And your wife will still prefer being with him to being with you . Can 't I just go home and explain ? There are rooms upstairs . I 'll come and get you when it 's over . I ... Fuck ! Who is that man in my home ? He 's you . But that man is in my home . in the same way you did . Technically you 're the same person . He 's like your reflection . Can 't I just go home and explain ?

I was just cutting my neighbor 's hair . That way it won 't fall off . I 'll get help . okay ? Wait . What 's wrong ? I don 't know how to explain this . I need your help . - Excuse me ? - Come on . Have a seat and don 't move until an ambulance comes . Please . What are you doing ? that way . Why ? that way . - No . follow me . Let 's go back to the road . That way . keep going forward . I have to go . That way . Please . Trust me . it 's okay . I need you to do something for me . - I 'll explain later . - Why not now ? It 's not easy to explain . No ! Shit ! Do as I say . Turn your head to the right . my right . Now lower your head a bit . A bit more . Don 't look at me . Now bite your left thumb . Slowly . Like you 're thinking of something . Now pull up your shirt . Take it off . Now ! Slowly . I 'm sorry . I won 't hurt you . You can put it back on . We 're done . You see ? Can I go now ? by that rock . Crouch there . Take off your pants . You can put them back on later . Go on . don 't I ? hand them over . Should I take off anything else ? it 's okay . Give them to me . Are you sure ? Yeah . Give me your pants . What about my panties ? I didn 't say that . Hello ? fuck ! I need you to do something for me . I 'll explain later . Why not now ? . It 's not easy to explain . Hello ! wait ! Hey ! Please open the door ! Listen to me a second ! you know ... and suddenly I saw you with my ... I was far away ... don 't call anybody ! Hey ! wait ! Wait ! Clara ! Bye ! - I 'll have them by the door . - Okay . - It sounded like ... - I just heard thunder . You mean that ? . Yeah . I think so . listen . Stay calm . I 'm in another building . I 'll be right over . Stay there . thanks . Hello ? Yes ? - This is Hector 2 . - What ? The second one . Keep your voice down . Hector might hear us . okay . He left the walkie-talkie on the table in the basement . All right I 'm the one wearing the bandage . Get him up to the silo . Make up something . I 'll show up in a car . - Make up something ? - Hello ? - Yes ? - Did you say something ? One second . Is the man after you wearing a bandage ? a pink one . He 'll never think to look for you in there . I have to lower the hatch from here . I 'll activate it and get in with you . Come on ! the pink mummy ! I admit it should have occurred to me when ... Come on . Where are you going ? To the house . You need to be examined . You 're the first vertebrate to ever travel in time . That bull about surveillance cameras could have used more preparation ... Surveillance cameras ! We could use some . - What are you doing ? - I have to get back in ! What ? Something went wrong ! So you want to fix it now ? Forget it ! - Listen to me ! - We 'll talk at the house ! - Come here ! - Forget it ! No way ! What are you doing ? Come back or I 'll tear it apart . Go right ahead . I 'll wait for you at the house . trying to ruin me ? After all I ... What else has to happen before you realize the implications ? I have to do it . It 's not going to happen . The tank won 't work . Don 't lie to me . Your trip used up all the energy . I don 't know ... Sorry . There was something there . but it 's not ... You took it out ? No . Where is it ? I threw it away outside . It 's one of the batteries . We can 't do anything without it . Come on . it creates them . I just need a head start on the other two . I need a previous moment to be able to ... I had activated the machine seconds before you appeared inside it . It was turned off before that . You can 't materialize inside a machine if it 's off . It 's impossible . Seconds before ? How many seconds before ? Maybe 30 or 40 . You 'd have a 30 or 40-second head start . It 's absurd . If you travel into the past and alter events there will be 3 of you . Which will likely cause a chain reaction of events beyond your control . I won 't interfere . like he did before . My change won 't affect his plan . Then there will be 2 of you . You and Hector 2 . I follow him and finish him off . We 'd be one again . You have no idea what you 're saying . Hold on . Why did you throw that thing away ? I ... what I mean is ... right ? yeah . Before I showed up . Because I imagined ... One moment . How did you know I 'd want to use the machine again ? You knew it all along . Are you tricking me again ? You 're tricking me again . Tell me . don 't make matters worse . You knew what would happen . Why ? Because Hector 3 told me . Hector 3 ? Hector 3 . The third one . You 're kidding me . You weren 't the first to appear in the tank . You were the second . The first had appeared earlier . He threatened me . He made me act surprised to see you . He made me go along with it He appeared earlier ? How much earlier ? Maybe 30 or 40 seconds . But ... He left right after you . I never found out what he wanted . You 've been deceiving me this whole time . I went up to the silo to prepare for Hector 1 's arrival when suddenly I got a buzz on the walkie . calling from the house . much earlier . It was daytime . It was Hector 3 . Hello ? - This is Hector 3 . - Who ? The last one . Listen to me . I 'm very sorry . What happened ? I 'm afraid everyone will know what we did . like something horrible had happened . He told me everything that would happen . trying to go back to the past ... but he said to stop you at all costs . You 'll be Hector 3 if you go through with it . What I say won 't stop you . Happy ? Wait a minute . You mean the 2nd trip I 'm about to take was already made ? Apparently you couldn 't solve your little problem . You told me yourself it failed . It makes no sense . Wait . You say Hector 3 called you from his walkie . Yeah . You mean ... from this walkie . Yeah . Shine the light on it . Over there ! I think this is yours . All I ask is think it over . what happened ? I have no choice . Calm down and listen to me . I 'm from the future . Your machine works . - Where ... ? - Listen to me . - How ... ? - Listen to me ! Or everyone will know you turned it on without authorization . Right now there are 3 of me . You 're going to help me get rid of the other two . Hector 2 is about to come out of the tank . Help him get Hector 1 into the tank . Hector 2 ? But ... He 'll explain it to you . - But ... - Stand there . Calm him down . I have to reach the house before you . Make sure he doesn 't see me . you got it ? Calm him down . Ask him who he is . - But who 's Hector 1 ? - Go ! Shit ! You 're here ! he might hear you . I need a remote for the gate . - In the desk ... - Not for the white car . The others . There aren 't any others . Then another car . There 's a truck . right ? right ? but he won 't listen . He 'll leave at some point . What are you going to do ? Go after him . Hello ? Hello ? - This is Hector 3 . - Who ? The last one . Listen to me . - I 'm very sorry . - What happened ? I 'm afraid everyone will know what we did . Looks like you bet on the wrong horse . I 'm a failure . Hector . Hector ? . Where are you ? Why did you have to turn on the machine ? I don 't know . They won 't turn it on for another 6 months . I won 't be authorized to be there . I guess ... right ? keep the guy with the bandage out of the tank at all costs . Why ? At least that way somebody will be there to smack you . What happened ? I think we 're both running from the same person . He won 't find us here . - His face is bandaged . - Yeah . He 's up there . He won 't come down here . Have you got a telephone ? No . Sit here . Wake up ! There 's a house nearby . Can you get up ? There it is . Come on . we shouldn 't go in that house . Careful . Hello ? I 'll go check . Hector ! What happened to you ? Nothing . There 's someone outside . Across the garden . He broke the fence . A man with his face covered . I ran down here to hide and I heard someone on the stairs . There 's somebody in the house . I called the police . What 's wrong ? My God . Hello ? Who is that ? Come with me . Hector ... Hide in there until I say . Tell me what 's happening ! don 't come out . Don 't interfere . Please ! Listen . That guy is crazy . He saw you from far away and went nuts . You have to hide from him . You have to fool him . Come on . There 's an attic upstairs . " run upstairs and lock the door behind you . You 're beautiful . Now . wait ! Hey ! Please open the door ! Listen to me a second ! you know ... And suddenly I saw you with my ... don 't call anybody ! What happened ? what 's going on ? Relax . Hector ... It 's okay . We still have a while before it starts raining .

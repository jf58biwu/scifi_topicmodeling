 David , he was operated on . - On his brain ? Why ? - They 're not sure . - Where you going ? - Mexico . People are dying there from an antibiotic resistant strain of TB . I want you in Hudson Point , Illinois . The people have temporarily lost the ability to feel any pain . They inflict horrific injuries on themselves without realizing it . - How bad is it ? - 46 cases . Five people are actively suffering from the disorder . - You got a take ? - Everybody 's drinking the same water . Breathing the same air . Corn is really huge down here . In Chiapas , there are over a million people at risk . The Mexican government has not invited anyone into Chiapas . They 're fully aware of this outbreak . What if they brought it here ? Let 's get some concrete answers before we start throwing around words like " biological weapons " . I 've got bad news . Our TB strain is identical to the KwaZulu-Natal slum in South Africa . We don 't know how to kill it . Just got a call from homeland . There was firefight in Chiapas . It appears that Carlos was caught in the middle . He 's missing . And we are to presume dead . - How 's it going ? - Good . Just finishing . Got that TB strain percolating with every antibiotic from isoniazid to pyrazinamid . Okay , so now all we do is wait . I hate waiting . Me too . - You hear from David ? - No , you ? Where 's David ? - He went back to Mexico , didn 't he ? - Of course he did . - You didn 't think he 'd go back there ? - Goddamnit ! Come on , Wes . Don 't act so surprised . He knows that Washington and Ottawa are doing all they can . Like what ? It 's been two days and nothing . - Not a word about Carlos . - Riddlemeyer 's gonna love this call . Then don 't make it , Wes . Really . What he doesn 't know won 't hurt him . He 's expecting him in Hudson today . 7 more accidents involving people who can 't feel pain . - We 're on top of it . - And ? And it 'd be nice to have David 's brain on top of it too . Exactly . Oh , God ... Shit . Okay ! Canadian ! I 'm a Canadian scientist ! I 'm a scientist . Okay ! Turning right ! Alright ! Stopping ! Stopping ! Take it easy ! Speak English ? No hablo español , alright ? I 'm a scientist , alright ? Scientisimo . Comprende scientisimo . Que pasa aqui ? Que pasa ? Que quiere aqui ? It 's a passport ! It 's just a passport ! Canadian citizen . - Just relax ! - Que quieres ? Don 't point that gun at me . Come on . Listen , I need to speak to Sub-commandante Muñoz . - Que quieres con el comandante Muñoz ? - Si , Commandant Muñoz ! - She knows me . Compadres . Comprande ? - Arriba ! - Muñoz ! Take me to see Muñoz ! - No ! No ! Very important that she sees me . Oh geez ! I 'm not wearing the fucking bag ! ReGenesis 4x02 La Consecuencia Subtitles Team NorBAC Bsiocnarf , Dapitch666 , Enelea , Icefre @ k Linwelin , Michvanilly , MikL Version NoTag 1.01 I 'm still using those ! You don 't want me here . I 'll leave . Just give me Carlos Serrano . - What makes you think I have him ? - The army don 't know where he is . - You 've not heard from him ? - I wouldn 't be here if I had . - After he betrayed us , he disappeared . - Betrayed you ? My men were hidden in the countryside . Safe from this disease . Safe from the Mexican army . Carlos and you convinced me to gather them for vaccination . They were slaughtered like ants . Or was it you who betrayed us ? I can think of a much easier way for you to get in my pants . - I just want the truth . - The truth ? The truth is , nobody wanted us to come down here . People were dying , that 's why we came . We don 't give a shit about politics or your goddamn revolution . We 're here to stop a pandemic ... And I 'm sorry , lady , but we 're all you 've got . Did you bring a cure for the sick ? - Do you know where Carlos Serrano is ? - Rico ! He was the last to see him . - Tell him what you told me . - Hello , Rico . You 're looking well . The Federales attacked us . I ran one way , Carlos ran the other . They followed him . - Then I heard shots . - You don 't know what happened to him ? No . I went back . I didn 't see a body . Have you checked with the local doctors or the local clinics ? - Or the morgue ? - We just have a cemetery . He 's been missing for two days and you have nothing ? Nothing yet ! What do you have for me ? We will keep looking . I 'll give him back dead or alive . Did you bring a cure ? There is no cure . But we did think of something . A way to treat the sick . Go on . This strain of TB has become mutated . It 's resistant to every drug developed in the last 20 years . How are you going to treat it ? With drugs it hasn 't mutated a resistance to . - Something new ? - No . Something old . An antibiotic that hasn 't been used on TB in like ... 60 years . Something called streptomycin . Gracias . We may have found your compadre . I have got to fucking learn how to speak Spanish . Carlos ! - Hey , David . - Jesus . Don 't move . You okay ? You look like shit . I feel like shit . What the fuck happened ? - They shot at me . - Who ? - The soldiers . Mexican soldiers . - Goddamn Federales . - Wait a minute . You 've been shot ? - No . I dove for cover went down a 20-foot embankment . Just busted myself up . - Broken ribs ? - I think so . I 'll be okay . - So what did I miss ? - More bad news ... The TB is extensively drug resistant . - Are you 're sure ? Nothing will kill it ? - The strain 's from South Africa . South Africa ? KwaZulu-Natal ? How did that get into Chiapas , David ? I don 't know . I was hoping we can find Patient Zero and ask him . What makes you think he 's still alive ? Dead or alive , if we find him , he 'll have a lot of answers to what 's been happening here . Come on . Other than a couple of cracked ribs , he 's fine . - I want you two out of there now . - That sounded like an order . - Then take it as a suggestion . - Taken . It 's nice to know that you care though , Wes . How safe are you ? I don 't know . - And the strep injections ? - It 's gonna be at least a week before we can confirm . I have new patients coming in everyday . - How 's it going up there ? - It 's slow . I gotta grow a second batch of TB . First sign of life in those culture dishes , I want you to hit it with every antibiotic you 've got . You don 't have faith in the Streptomycin . Just want a backup , don 't get lazy on me . Got a hundred cocktails standing by . Thank you . What else ? We 've got some new cases of accident victims in Hudson , Illinois . And unfortunately , a lot of them are kids . we 've got a 3-year-old girl ... I 'm sorry . But we have got to hit this thing with everything we 've got down here , before it blows up on us . Rachel , believe me the fuse is lit . Got it . And now she hates my guts . Hey , Bob . I brought you some flowers . I know you can 't see them , but at least you can smell them . So , David is still in Mexico with Carlos I guess this whole thing is ... pretty scary with the whole TB business . I suppose you could use my help . - Are you alright ? - I 'm good . I just don 't know what I 'm doing here . Thanks for the flowers . Please help me get the needles out and we can get to work . Excuse me . Can I help you ? I work with Bob . I was just coming by to see how he was doing . He 's doing fine . - I 'm Dr. Jartikoff , his attending . - Hi , Mayko Tran . Do you know how much longer he 'll have to be in this induced coma ? It 's hard to say ... We don 't have much control over the swelling in his brain . Sure . I think the prognosis looks pretty good . - Good . - He 'll be back , sooner than you think . You hear that , Bob ? Hurry and wake up , okay ? We got work to do . I 'm glad you 're safe . What did he say ? He said until Bob 's swelling goes down they want him to keep him in an induced coma for a while just to be safe . But he is improving ? That 's what Dr. Jartikoff said . You sound beat , David . That 's an improvement . Five minutes ago , I thought I was dead . We 've got the WHO checking all the flights from South Africa to Mexico . We 're looking at over 4,000 passengers . I don 't care , okay ? I need you to track everybody down . Has there been any alerts of this TB breaking out elsewhere in the world ? - No , just in the ghetto in Durban . - Okay , stay on it . - Call me when you hear from the WHO . - Okay . You be safe . Thanks . - You slept well . - Lots of codeine . What 's up ? David , this distribution pattern doesn 't make any sense . The red flags indicate the first wave of infection , all soldiers . The yellow and blue flags were infected one month later . The soldiers ' families . In almost every case , the Zapatista soldier got infected at least a month before any symptom showed up in their families . Are you telling me that all these first cases came down - with symptoms at the same time ? - The same week . Almost the same day . Then how ? Let 's say the men are at a training camp . The government buys an aerosolized form of KwaZulu-Natal TB off some scientist trying to make a buck . The men are sleeping ... You know what 's gonna happen if we accuse the Mexican ? Half the world is condemning Mexico for its brutal tactics in Chiapas . We will become the Mexican army 's number one target . We have to be sure before we make any accusations . And be back in Canada . But that doesn 't mean there 's a conspiracy . That just means they all contracted it at the same time . What 's the incubation period for TB ? It was like two , three months ? Before it can be properly diagnosed . Yes . OK . Let 's just start with that . Maybe you 're right , there was a training camp , whatever . They all participated in some group activity two to three months ago . Let 's find that out . And then maybe , we can track it to a nice simple Patient Zero . - Alright ? - Alright . I will get on it . I think they prefer that I eat alone . It might be better that we don 't eat together . I don 't want them to think ... I 'm a doctor talking to his colleague . Let them think what they want . So how did you end up in Chiapas ? The indigenous people of Mexico have been oppressed for hundreds of years . Enslaved . Used as cannon fodder . Land that belonged to them was taken away . I thought I could help . But ... I didn 't fit in . Some things take longer to change than others . But you know , Rico . The work you 're doing here , it 's ... It 's good . What a world , Carlos ? So many people , so many things we find to hate . Race , religion ... Sexual preference . You 'd think we could find better things to do with our spare time . Maybe some day , my friend . Maybe some day . Jesus , Mayko ! I 'm in the middle of lunch ! Nine-year-old who heated hot chocolate in the microwave . Scalded his mouth , tongue , lips , not to mention his esophagus and stomach . - Third-degree burns ? - David , I 'm good at multi-tasking . I am not good at putting this on hold ! Alright ! " Alright " as in " what have I got on Hudson ? " We got 3 new leads based on patients ' samples . - And she 's in too . - I PCRed for viruses . I found that most of the pain - free victims have a rotavirus . A rotavirus isn 't that dangerous . The most you 'd get would be like a bad diarrhea . Then I cultured the samples and got two more leads . I found a Neisseria meningitidis . - What , meningitis ? - Yeah . Brain inflammation could theoretically block pain receptors . So , okay , fine , fine . How do we prove it ? Check the spinal fluid in the victims . What else have you found ? It was on the nasal swab cultures . Something growing like a fungus . Well there you go . Fungi produce all sorts of crazy neurological shit . See if you can ID the fungus . Alright . And you know , find out if the rotavirus has any pain blocking properties . I 'm all over it . - Call me when you 've got something . - Thank you , David . Let me ask you . Two or three months ago , before the TB symptoms showed , was there any occasion where the Zapatistas were all together ? A group gathering ? What was that ? Early July ? Yes . La Fiesta de San Fermin . They celebrate like they do in Spain . The sangria and bulls . Fireworks . Were you here then ? No . There was no TB to worry about . But ... I know who you should talk to . People sleep in the church during the festival ? Others stay with relatives , friends . People make room . - Some people don 't even sleep . - Lots of close , personal contact . Do you remember anything unusual about that weekend ? Sick tourist ? No , the touristas they stay away because of the fighting . It 's only locals . But I don 't recall any sickness . Padre ? Would you excuse me please for one minute ... They have to have contracted the disease the weekend of the festival . Whole families were at that festival , why would the men get sick first ? They tell me you 're on top of the situation in Hudson Point . Hello , Carl . - What are you doing in town ? - You look tired . - Working too hard ? - At least one of us is . Congressman Kirchner is concerned about his constituency and I 'd like to be able to tell him we 've got this thing licked . I would like to be able to tell him that too , but we don 't . Why not ? Because these things take time , Carl . Any leads ? Rotaviruses . What ? They affect the gastrointestinal system , usually benign in humans ... And you found this in the Hudson victims ? - All of them . - So what does that mean ? Carl , I have to get back to work now . I just need to tell Kirschner something . Some strains of rotavirus in mice are neurotropic . So , it effects the brains ? Could affect the nervous system . We 're still checking that out . At least we 're trying to . - See anything interesting there , dear ? - So , what 's this about fungus ? We just ID-ed it as Eupenicillium Shearii . And as I understand it all the victims in Hudson had it growing ? - In their nasal passages , yes . - So where did it come from ? All we know is that it produces a compound that blocks pain receptors . Alright . So the fungus could be it . Maybe . And if you would let me get back to work , I could be able to tell you that . It 's always good to see you , Rachel . Maybe there 's some activity that men do that the women and children don 't participate in . Father ... I 'd like to ask ... Are you feeling okay ? This outbreak began during the festival ? - That 's what our data suggests , yes . - Gracias . Are you feeling okay ? Yes ... Is there something you want to tell me , father ? As I give the last rites , I hear over and over the same thing ... The dying men believe that God is punishing them for break ... breaking their marriage vows . Breaking which marriage vows ? During the solstice festival , many of the men visit ... La puta . A prostitute ? That 's it ! Patient Zero . All the men contracted the TB by sleeping with the town hooker . They disperse to the countryside , bring the disease to infect their families . Father , do you know where we could find this puta ? Ah , shit ... Father , we 're going to get you examined . - Smell that ? - Ah , shit . Madre ... She 's been dead at least a month . Dried blood all over the pillow . Consistent with TB . Okay , how does the local puta come down with a rare African strain of TB ? I don 't think she had the money . Maybe she picked it up off a South African tourist ? She could have been infected on purpose , put back into the general population ? You 're reaching for something we can 't prove . You 're saying this woman was used against us , like a weapon ? - She wouldn 't even know she had it . - Or she picked it up from a tourist . David , come on . I know a person who can tell me if what Carlos says is true . The person responsible for this will pay . So the TB cultures haven 't told us jackshit , - is what you 're saying ? - David , it 's too soon . We need at least another week ! Come on , Mayko ! Something 's got to look promising . Right now , all the cultures indicate the TB bacterium is still growing . Nothing is working yet ! Shit ! Are you getting any results with the Streptomyicin ? Three more days before we can test for positive results . Okay , so we 're all in the hands of Mother Nature . Somebody needs to light a fire under Mother Nature 's ass . I fucking hate waiting ... Maybe you can distract yourself with what 's going on in Illinois . The plant-like fungus that I found in all of the victims ... - Eupenicillium Shearii , was that it ? - It 's not growing just in the victims , it 's growing in the noses of everybody in Hudson Point . Great . What are they snorting ? I got a slight response from the mice who breathed in the fungus . Their ability to feel pain is maybe somewhat diminished , but not ... How did you determine that ? The old-fashioned way . Put the little guys on a hot plate to see how long it 'd take them to dance . Yeah , something like that . Alright , check the levels of yeast in the mice . See if it 's proportional to the Hudson patients . There 's a connection between the ability to feel pain and the amount of fungus ? Exactly . And Mayko ? Once you 're finished picking everyone 's noses , see if you can figure out how this shit 's getting airborne . Hey ! What are you doing ? He 's a government spy . A traitor . We were warned by someone in the army , a sympathizer ... Or he 's being set up by someone who doesn 't want him here ! I didn 't do this ! I will let you live if you confess . Admit what you 've done . Admit what you 've done ! I didn 't tell the army where our men are . I swear this , please ! Did you bring the puta here ? Speak , or I will put a hole through your lies ! But I did not know she was infected . - What else ? - I swear this ! Please ! What else ? ! Say it ! She was let out of jail . She begged me to bring her back here . - How much did she pay you to do this ? - Nothing ! - How much ? - He 's telling the truth , Muñoz ! How much ? The soldiers gave me 200 American dollars to get her out of their sight . I believed them . She was Indian . They hated her . Muñoz , he was set up , put down the fucking gun . I used the money to buy medicine for our people . I 'm so sorry . Please forgive me . Thank you , Rico . For your honesty . Why ? Why Muñoz ? - Why Muñoz ? He told you the truth ! - I have lost my patience . I think it 's time you leave . You 've accomplished nothing . And what about the girl ? Tucked away . Why didn 't you call me , Bob ? I 'm sorry you won 't be along for the ride . Where the hell have you been ? Just get better . Mad , Bad and Dangerous . Science beyond the brink . - Here it is ! Listen ! - Mayko ! No ! " This first effort by David Sandström cannot be dismissed " as just another attempt by a leading scientist " to prove the value of his efforts on the cutting edge of discovery . " But it can be dismissed as a convoluted and disappointing diatribe " drowning in hyperbole . " " Drowning in hyperbole . " - One person 's opinion . - Yeah . - Probably an ex-girlfriend wrote it . - I never said I was Charles Dickens . You really go off on the Chinese here , don 't you ? Well , somebody had to be held accountable . - Feel like some dessert ? - I would love dessert . Why do you feel that way about Chiapas , David ? Come on , Carlos . We witness genocide . We should be taking this to the United Nations . Taking what to the UN ? We don 't have any proof . I 'm sorry . So we do nothing ? We do science , not politics . And they just ... They just get away with it . Whole world 's going to hell , Carlos . If we 're lucky , we 'll get to toast marshmallows over the embers . That is bullshit . Excuse me . You 're focusing on the wrong thing , you know that , right ? People are being slaughtered by my own government , David . That doesn 't change the fact that we 're still dealing with a major outbreak here and we still don 't know how to stop it ! Now those people need your help , not your moral indignation . I don 't know ... You can spend the rest of your life running around in the dark trying to figure out a way to hang this whole fucking mess around the neck of the government , and you 'll have achieved nothing . Or , you can do what you do , right now . Help figure out a way to stop this thing and save thousands of lives . Hell , I don 't know , maybe even prevent a pandemic . Look , I know how you feel , man . I do . No , you don 't . Then tell me . I feel ashamed . I don 't care about your priorities , Carl . We need to get back into Chiapas . " I 'm working on it " doesn 't make me feel any better . We need more medical aid . We need more drugs , more equipment . Yeah , well they 've offended me the way they 've treated their own people . Then make them care , Carl . Come on . You 've been in Washington long enough to know how to bullshit some politicians into giving you what you want . You 're welcome . Jesus . Fucking bureaucracy . Looks like the situation in Chiapas is escalating . The army has amassed at the Chiapas border . Great . So now nobody gets in or out . Swell . If you get any positive results on the cocktails you 're working on I will let Washington know , and it 'll go through acceptable diplomatic channels . What ? The rest of the civilized world isn 't acceptable anymore ? What 's going on with Hudson ? It 's spreading . Kirchner 's riding Riddlemeyer 's ass and Riddlemeyer 's riding mine . - I 'd like to see that picture . - And I would like an answer for them ! Okay , let 's solve this Hudson 's Point thing before the town gets its reality show and Wes gets delusions of grandeur . Where are we at with the fungus ? - Do you have a few minutes ? - Yes . Good . I 've been trying to isolate the compound that blocks the pain receptors - and get enough to inject into a mouse . - Got any ratios from mice to humans ? Yes , absolutely . Alright , this line represents the amount of the Fungus in the humans . This line represents the amount in mice . And this , shows what happens when you take into account weight . So , there 's the same amount of fungus in the mice as there is in the humans . The same amount of the Hudson Fungus was found in everyone , whether they experienced the pain-free episodes or not . So , I don 't think the amount has anything to do with this . - I found the source of the fungus ! - Fantastic . Local sweet corn . It 's on the husks ! You tear them off and the fungus goes airborne . Right up your nose . So everybody we tested in Hudson has the fungus . But not everybody was affected . Why ? Well obviously , it 's interacting with something in the people who experience the pain-free episodes . Mayko , open your mouth . What the fuck ? I think you bit your tongue . I 'll get some ice . That 's gotta hurt . No . No , it doesn 't . - No , I 'm not feeling any pain at all . - Let 's put Mayko under a microscope . Okay . Alright . So I can confirm Hudson fungus in Mayko 's nasal passages . - Wonderful . - And mine . But you 're not pain free . So obviously , the fungus is producing more pain reducing agents in Mayko than in me . It could channel off . Alright , so what are the differences between the two of you ? Ethnicity . But most of the patients in Hudson Point were Caucasian . - Age . - Easy there ... - What you ate . - Prescription drugs . A guava shake . - Brown rice . - Over-the-counter drugs . - Not me . - Fabric softeners . Okay , stop . Please , stop . Obviously , Mayko has something in common with the patients in Hudson . So I 'd like the two of you to write down everything you ate today , anything you drank . Your product that you use , including the brand names . Now all we 've got to do is find the needle in the haystack . Right , Wes ? Sorry . I was culturing the Hudson Fungus with our toiletries and I got a hit off Mayko 's toothpaste . Careful ... It stimulated the fungus to produce more of the pain reducing byproduct . Okay , what 's in the toothpaste ? Sodium fluoride , sodium lauryl sulfate , calcium sodium phosphosilicate , zinc chloride , hydrogen peroxide , artificial colouring . More to the point , what 's different between your toothpaste and Mayko 's ? I 've got her cross-checking that right now . Carlos , any word from Doctors Without Borders ? Nothing . And the Zapatistas haven 't updated their website in days , which is strange . Yeah . David , I got it ! - Now I 've got it too . - No , what do you taste ? - Let me try again . - No ! Mint ! Mint , minty flavour . It 's methyl salicylate . This way . Okay , both the mice have the fungus . I 've been administering the methyl salicylate to this one for over an hour . Now let 's see if it 's the methyl salicylate that is kicking the production of the compound into overdrive . Here we go . There 's the control . Okay ! His feet are burning ! Here we go . - Come on little guy . - There we go . I 'll get Wes . That 's it . That is it . Methyl salicylate : C8H803 , AKA wintergreen . - It 's toxic in its pure form . - Isn 't this what killed that jogger ? Her body absorbed high levels of methyl salicylate from muscle-pain ointment . In our case , wintergreen , as a scent , enters the nostrils where it meets up with the Hudson fungi . - You get chemical warfare in your nose . - Fungus doesn 't like the wintergreen and so as a defensive reaction it produces this compound . It takes a direct route from your nose to your blood in your brain , - where it blocks the pain receptors . - Everybody that 's infected in Hudson is using the same toothpaste as Mayko ? Methyl salicylate is in hundreds of consumer products . Mostly as a flavouring agent . Ice-cream , chewing gum , mouthwash , candy . - Almost anything minty has it . - So what are we gonna do ? For starters we gotta get everybody in and around Hudson on antifungals . - And that includes you and I. - Bravo ! Even I can follow your work . Good evening . So where does this thing come from in the first place ? In one species of mushroom , research was carried out that demonstrated that the spores were spread worldwide by blowing in the wind . - And why this and why Hudson ? - They upset the natural balance . - They dusted the corn for ... - They had a problem with Rust fungi . There you go . The Rust and the Hudson fungi were probably natural checks for each other . You get rid of the Rust , the Hudson moved in . This is good news . I want your data on my desk , first thing in the morning . Why ? Well , just think about the people in the world who suffer from chronic pain : There are cancer patients . There are people who have severe arthritis . Soldiers ! We could help billions . For once , I 'm in complete agreement with you . - Just send me your findings . - You can get them yourself . And download away . So , you didn 't feel as if you should consult me before you ... distributed this information ? Like you said , Carl . This is a great thing . You should share it with the whole world . - David , may I have a word with you . - Sure . Make sure you post all of our findings on our website . Already on it . What can I do for you , Carl ? Is this where you were last week ? - Why ? - Is it ? Yes . They thought it was their only solution . - There was no other way out . - We were this close - of finding a cure . - But ... And this was not us . I have an entire virology lab full of TB cultures ... - Their backs were against the wall . - In 48 hours , we could have saved them ! - Did this come from the Pentagon ? - No ! This is the Mexican ... Can you come up here a second ? David . Oh no . You tell him . They carpet bombed the village , the quarantine city , everything . They blew it off the map . I received a phone call from Mexico City at 6 AM . They considered the full ramifications of the threat of a pandemic . That they probably started ! They felt they needed to take extraordinary measures . By bombing Chiapas . The US government will condemn their actions . And the Mexican government will say it was best for their people . And justifying the murder of hundreds of people as a health prevention . They 're exterminating the indigenous people of Mexico . That 's what this is all about . Whatever you 're doing in there , it 's working . They stopped using the pentobarbital . The rest is up to you , Bob . Keep fighting . I 'll be here . Hi , David . Hi , Bob . I 'm glad you 're relieved ... You can sense that ? So you 're ... still up and running , eh ? Very much so ... I 'm gonna ask you a couple of questions . Okay ... What 's your phone number ? I can do better than that ... 3.141592653 ... Okay . Okay , Bob . Bob ? You can remember Pi , that 's great . What month is it ? June ... August ... ? - September . - September . Right ... Hang on a sec . Here you go . Slowly . Easy . You okay ? Yes . Thank you . So what have you been doing , Bob ? What do you mean ? What 's with the surgery ? What surgery ? Brain surgery . Nevermind that . Nevermind that now . Where were you ? I was ... - What did he have you doing ? - Who ? Roth . I don 't know ... I can 't remember , David . That 's okay ... I don 't know ... Okay . - Okay . It 's okay . - I don 't know ... - What the hell is going on ? - They 're dead ! - Four of ' em . Just didn 't wake up . - What happened ? We had multiple cases of intravenous drug users dying of liver failure . - Just in the shelters ? - Oh , no , all over the city . It 's hepatitis C. Heavy viral , all consistent with acute infection . I know HC replicated like crazy . But a thousand times in 24 hours ? You mind if we get up to speed , see what you got ? What I 've got is an identified hep C strain . Very little luck with treatments . And now 26 dead . This MRI looks fine . Came out of the coma without any side effects . Except he can 't remember the last 3 months . There 's something about what I 've done . Where I 've been ... I just don 't know . Roth has been the money behind some very questionable research . He was doing something in a secret lab for three months ! Doing something with Bob . And Bob can 't remember anything about it ! - I 'll make some calls . - Thank you .

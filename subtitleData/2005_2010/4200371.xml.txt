 Is it ready ? Hey , that 's a great punch . Fear no good . So emotion ... Breathing . Breakdown , breakdown . Okay . I can make it work for a while but you need ... Okay . Okay . No , no , no . Shut that off . Turn it off ! Watch out ! Okay . Martina . No , wait . Oh , that 's not right . You see that ? You see that ? Our ticket out of here . Damn it . Here 's something a bit more interesting . It 's possible gamma sickness . Milwaukee . A man drank one of those guarana sodas . Guess it had a little more kick than he was looking for . Where was it bottled ? Porto Verde , Brazil . Get our agency people looking for a white man at that bottling plant . Tell them no contact . If he even sees them , he 's gone . I got you what I could . Short notice , but they 're all quality . And I pulled you an ace . Emil Blonsky . Born in Russia , raised in England and on loan to SOCOM from the Royal Marines . I know you 're cashing some chips for this , Joe . Glad I could help . Just make it good . This is the target and the location . Snatch and grab , live capture . Have your dart clips and suppression ordinance , live fire is for backup only . We got local out there , but we want it tight and quiet . Is he a fighter ? Your target is a fugitive from the U.S. Government and stole military secrets . He is also implicated in the deaths of two scientists , a military officer , an Idaho state trooper and possibly two Canadian hunters , so don 't wait to see if he 's a fighter . Trank him and bring him back . Oh , come on . Gentlemen . Here we go . Get rid of the damn dog . Take him . Target 's on the move . Where is he ? - He 's on the ground . - Let 's go . Go . Move , move . Thank you . Go , go , go ! Go , go ! Stay on him ! Do not lose him . Get around behind him . Target moving past Mobile Unit 090 . Oh , no . You gotta be kidding me . Where is he ? Target acquired . Let 's go . My computer . Give me that . No . Not so tough now , huh ? Try those fancy moves again . Come on . Stop . Please . Me angry very bad . You very angry ? I very angry . Oh , no . You don 't understand . Something really bad is about to happen here . Yeah . Very bad . Anybody else seeing this ? We got a bogey . Please advise . That is the target ! Use every trank you 've got . Do it now . Go wide . Go wide . Go wide . Move . No . Behind him . Get behind him . Move ! Move ! Get him ! Get him ! Get him ! Leave me alone . No ! No ! I knew something was different before I got the shot off . Had it on him when he bolted . Is that a girlfriend ? She helps him maybe ? She is no longer a factor . We closed that door to him a long time ago . He 's alone . He wants to be alone . Let 's see if he 's been talking to anybody . Forgive me , sir . Doesn 't anybody want to talk about what went down in there , because ... ? He didn 't lose us . And he was not alone , sir . We had him , and then something hit us . Something ... Something big hit us . It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball . It was the most powerful thing I 've ever seen . Well , it 's gone . Well , if Banner knows what it is I 'm gonna track him down , put my foot on his throat and ... That was Banner . It was Banner . You have to explain that statement , sir . No , I don 't . You 've done a good job . Pack up and get our men on the plane . We 're going home . Can you help me ? I don 't speak Portuguese . What ? Where ... ? Where am I ? Guatemala . I 'm going to the next town . Will you help me ? Get in . Here , put this on . Where are you going ? Home . I 've run into bad situations on crap missions before . I 've seen good men go down because someone didn 't let us know what we were walking into . I 've moved on because that 's what we do . I mean , that 's the job . But this ... This is a whole new level of weird . I don 't feel inclined to step away from it . So if you 're taking another crack at him , I want in . And with respect , you should be looking for a team that 's prepped and ready to fight because if that thing shows up again you 'll have a lot of professional tough guys pissing in their pants sir . Oh , yeah . Let me emphasise what I 'm about to share with you is tremendously sensitive both to me personally and the Army . You 're aware that we 've got an infantry weapons development programme while in WWll , they initiated a subprogramme for biotech force enhancement . A super soldier . Yes . An oversimplification , but yes . And I dusted it off . Got them doing serious work again . Bold work . Across the hall , they 're trying to arm you better . We 're trying to make you better . Banner 's work was very early phase . It wasn 't even weapons application . He thought he was working on radiation resistance . I would never have told him what the project really was . But he was so sure of what he was onto that he tested it on himself . And something went very wrong . Or it went very right . As far as I 'm concerned , that man 's whole body is property of the U.S. Army . You said he wasn 't working on weapons , right ? - No . - But you were , weren 't you ? You were trying other things . One serum we developed it was very promising . - So why did he run ? He 's a scientist . He is not one of us . Blonsky , how old are you ? Forty-five ? - Thirty-nine . - It takes a toll , doesn 't it ? Yes , it does . So get out of the trenches . You should be a colonel now with your record . No , I 'm a fighter . I 'll be one for as long as I can . If I could take what I know now , put it in the body I had 10 years ago that would be someone I wouldn 't wanna fight . I could probably arrange something like that . Take care , kids . Stan , I give you my word . Whatever you 've heard about me , it 's not true . I know it . I always knew it . And you know how I felt about you two . - Have you talked to her ? - No . She doesn 't know that I 'm here . She 's with somebody ? He 's a head shrink . They say he 's one of the best . But a really nice guy . Good , that 's good . Bruce . - What can I do to help you ? - I could use a bed for a few nights . You can have the spare room upstairs . That 'd be so great . There is ... There 's one other thing . Excuse me . Pardon me . Coming through . Hey , pal , I got a delivery on 5 . I don 't think there 's anybody up here . Oh , man , I 'm gonna catch hell if I don 't collect . You gotta let me try . I tell you what . I got an extra medium . Take it on the house . - You are the man . - God bless you , partner . Oh , boy . Okay . We 're pretty well closed here , folks , I 'm sorry . Oh , come on , Stan , it 's Friday night . Oh , kids . - I got nothing but marinara now . - I gotta have a Mr. Pink , please . She worked through dinner again , of course . Stan ? I go ... So , yes , I mean , where were you ? I can 't ... I don 't know where you were , Cecil . Then he goes , " Not where you 've been at . " I felt ... Oh , my God , I just felt so awful . Bruce . Betty ? What 's going on ? Betty . Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw . I don 't know what to say . Please , just tell me the truth . Oh , God . Thank God . I want you to come with me now . Please , come with me . Please . It 's our data . That got in there before they carted it all away . I hoped somewhere that it might tell us something someday . - Does the general know you have this ? - No , I don 't think so . I haven 't spoken to him in a couple of years . - You have to be sure . - Bruce . I don 't understand why we can 't just go in there together and talk to him . He told me what he wanted to do . He wants it out of me . He wants to dissect it so that he can replicate it . He wants to make it a weapon . - Hi . - Hi . - I thought you might wanna ... - Thanks . Listen , I should leave early . As early as I can . Really ? You can 't stay at all ? I want to , but it 's not just safe for me to be here . If I could borrow some cash ... - Of course . - I need to take a bus . Well , at least let me walk you to the station . Okay . - You have everything you need ? - Yeah . - Good night . - Good night . I hope you get some rest . We 're giving you a very low dose only . I need you sharp out there and disciplined . First sign of any side effect we stop and you 're off team until you straighten out . - Agreed ? - Agreed . You 'll get two separate infusions . One into the deep muscle one into the bone-marrow centres . Bone ones are gonna hurt . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . One , two , three , four ... Is everything okay ? I think so . - Come here . - What ? I just wanna do this . - It 's better like that . - Yeah . - It 's too tight , huh ? - Yeah , a little . Okay . What ? They 're here . Betty , look at me , look at me . You have to go far away from me . Don 't argue with me , just go , go . We 'd have had snipers on target in three more minutes . I wanna know who jumped the gun . He 's heading 270 . Move it . Blonsky , not yet . Sir . Look alive , this could get interesting . Stop . I got him . Stop . Stop . I know you 're in there . General , please . - Sir . - Dad ! Dad , please don 't do this . You can 't see this clearly . - Now , get inside . - There he is . Target is in the overpass . We have a visual . Do not engage . Repeat , do not engage . He 's lock ed in . - Put two canisters in there with him . - Fire . Get her back here . Now she 'll see . Alpha Team . Let him have all of it . Light him up . Come on , light him up . Where are the.50 cals ? Move your asses . Fall back . Oh , my God . - Blonsky , now you 're up . - Yes , sir . Cover me . Remember me ? My God , he 's doing it . Move him toward the cannons . Move . - All good . - Do it , now . - Please , please , please , no , please . - Get her back . You 're killing him ! Stop ! Get off of me ! Where 's the gunship ? - Is that it ? - Blonsky , pull back now . Pull back . Is that all you got ? - Fall back . - Fall back . - Let 's go , let 's go . - Find cover . - Move back , get down . - Move it . Betty ! - Move it , move it , move it . - Take cover . Fire , goddamn it . Bruce . Stop firing ! No ! You did the right thing , calling me . I need to know where they 're going . She 's in danger as long as she 's with him . From who ? He protected her . You almost killed her . I give you my word , her safety is my main concern at this point . You know , it 's a point of professional pride with me that I can always tell when somebody 's lying . And you are . I don 't know where he 's going . - I know she 'll help him if she can . - Then she 's aiding a fugitive . And I can 't help either one of them . I used to wonder why she never talked about you . Now I know . Where does she meet these guys ? Bruce ? Bruce ? It 's okay , it 's okay . Come here . Come this way . Watch your head . We 're okay . It 's okay . It 's just the rain . Will he ever walk again ? Most of the bones in his body look like crushed gravel right now . I will say this for him . He 's got a heart like a machine . Never seen anything like it outside of a racehorse . Here . Bruce ? Oh , hi . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , actually I feel a lot better . - Good . - I just had to get my data back . - You ate it ? - Well , you know the circumstances called for a little improvisation . Okay , so they didn 't have a great selection but I got you a few options . First things first . Oh , you 're kidding me . - What ? - No . - They were the stretchiest pair . - I 'll take my chances . Rumours continue to swirl about a violent clash between forces of the U.S. Military and an unknown adversary on the campus of Culver University earlier today . Sophomores Jack McGee and Jim Wilson witnessed some of the battle . It was so big . - It was lik e this huge , lik e , hulk . - Yeah . McGee , who happens to be a reporter for the campus paper captured this on his cell phone . Further search for the mysterious hulk was postponed by powerful thunderstorms in the Smoky Mountain National Forest . Take short back there , okay ? I have done this before , you know . I don 't know how you 've done this on your own for all this time . With clippers , usually . Wait , wait , wait . - What ? - We can 't do this . - It 's okay , I want to . - No . No . I can 't . I can 't get too excited . Not even a little excited ? It 's okay . Sir , it 's Blonsky . Has anyone found out if he has next of kin or family ? You can ask him yourself . Sir ? Good to see you back on your feet , soldier . Thank you , sir . How do you feel ? Pissed off and ready for round three . Basically , we can 't use any of this , because they can track all of it . Well , my lip gloss , can they track that ? - No , you can take your lip gloss . - Thank you . Well , I need my glasses . Well , you can take your glasses and your watch , okay ? We can use most of it , we just can 't use the credit cards , ID or phone . - Don 't even turn that on . - Okay . And we 'll take the cash , obviously . How are we gonna get where we need to go on $ 40 and no credit cards ? - Well , we could sell this . - No . No , that 's the only thing you have left from her . No . Well , we 'll have to try and get it back . Federals are already monitoring phones , plastic , and Dr. Ross ' web account . And local P.D. Have been placed on alert . They 'll pop up somewhere , and when they do it comes straight to us . They 're not gonna just pop up . He made it 5 years and got across borders without making any mistakes . He 's not gonna use a credit card . If he was trying to escape , he 'd be long gone . He 's not trying to escape , he 's looking for help . That 's how we 're gonna get him . We know what they 're after . He 's been talking to somebody . You 'll have copies of the correspondence . Aliases Mr. Green and Mr. Blue have been added to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Operations database . If he comes up for air , we 'll be waiting . If he mak es a peep we 'll hear him . And when he slips up , we 'll be ready . Smile . What is it like ? When it happens , what do you experience ? Do you remember those experiments we volunteered for at Harvard ? Those induced hallucinations ? It 's a lot like that . It 's a thousand times amplified . It 's like someone 's poured a litre of acid into my brain . - Do you remember anything ? - Just fragments , images . There 's too much noise , I can never derive anything out of it . - But then it 's still you inside it . - No , it 's not . I don 't know . In the cave , I really felt like it knew me . Maybe your mind is in there . It 's just overcharged and can 't process what 's happening . I don 't wanna control it . I wanna get rid of it . - You ready ? - Let 's even the playing field a little . Gentlemen ? Bruce , wake up . There 's something going on . We gotta go , walk toward the back . Just don 't move too fast . All right , come . It is a long way uptown . I think the subway is probably quickest . Me in a metal tube , deep underground with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city ? Right , let 's get a cab . Come on , now . Let 's go . You 're too slow , you drive like a woman . - Very nice , you see her ? - Oh , my God . She 's very pretty . Look out , you goat . Breathe , breathe , breathe . Are you out of your mind ? What is wrong with you ? What 's the matter , baby ? You don 't like a good ride ? Asshole ! I know a few techniques could help you manage that anger very effectively . You , zip it . - We 're walking . - Okay . Excuse me , Dr. Sterns . - Yes ? - I 'm sorry to bother you . I 'm Elizabeth Ross . Dr. Ross . I have someone who 'd like to meet you . Okay . It 's Mr. Blue , isn 't it ? Mr. Green ? I 've gotta tell you , I 've been wondering if you were even real . And if you were , what would it look like ? A person with that much power lurking in him . Nothing could have surprised me more than this unassuming man shaking my hand . But look , we 're not strolling in the park for a picnic here . Even if everything goes perfectly , if we induce an episode if we get the dosage exactly right , is that gonna be a lasting cure ? Or just some antidote to suppress that specific flare-up ? I don 't know . What I 'm saying is that if we overshoot this by even the smallest integer we 're dealing with concentrations with extraordinary levels of toxicity ... - You mean it could kill him ? - Kill him , yeah . I should say so . You should know there 's a flipside to this too . If we miss on the low side , if we induce me and it fails , this will be very dangerous for you . Look , I 've always been more curious than cautious . And that 's served me pretty well . So are we gonna do this ? How are you feeling , man ? Like a monster . Okay , on the table . These will protect you from yourself if you have a strong reaction . You can tell me later if you thought it was strong . Oh , come on . Stupid graduate students . Okay . You . You . You . This will be a somewhat novel sensation . We have begun . The dialysis machine will mix the antidote with your blood . So the antidote will only take hold once we 've achieved the full reaction . Just relax . Okay , we are comprehensive . Here we go . All right , we set to pop ? I 'd take your hands off him . Oh , my God . Wait , wait , there 's more . Wait . - No . Hang on . - Wait . Now do it . Do it ! Bruce , Bruce , look at me . Stay with me . The antidote . Now . Sterns , do it now . Bruce , look at me . Look in my eyes . Please look in my eyes . You 've gotta be kidding . - Bruce . - Oh , my God . Bruce ? Bruce , can you hear me ? Bruce . It 's okay , you 're okay . You 're okay . You did it . - He 's fine , this is fantastic . - It 's over . - Hi . - Hi . That was the most extraordinary thing I have seen in my entire life . Okay , you know what ? Stop , please . We need to talk about what happened in there . Absolutely , okay . The gamma pulse came from the amygdala . I think Dr. Ross ' primer lets the cells absorb the energy temporarily and then it abates . That 's why you didn 't die of radiation sickness years ago . Now , maybe we 've neutralised those cells permanently or maybe we just suppressed that event . I 'm inclined to think the latter , it 's hard to know . Because none of our test subjects ever survived . Wait . What did you just say ? - They weren 't getting the primer . - No , no , test subjects ? What test subjects ? Come with me . - What 's the activity level ? - Snipers are covering Alpha Sector . We started on rats and mice , but it just completely fried them we had to go bigger . We still don 't know which is more toxic . - The gamma or your blood . - What do you mean , my blood ? Bruce , this is all you . You didn 't send me much to work with so I had to concentrate it and make more . With a little more trial and error , there 's no end to what we can do . This is potentially Olympian . This gamma technology has limitless applications . We 'll unlock hundreds of cures . We will make humans impervious to disease . No , no , we 've gotta destroy it . - Wait , what ? - All of it , tonight . We 're gonna incinerate it . Is this the whole supply ? We could get the Nobel for this . You don 't understand the power of this thing . It is too dangerous , it cannot be controlled . At your discretion , shooter . Yeah , but this is Promethean fire . No shot . Blonsky is going in . Blonsky , stand down . My daughter 's in there . - We have the antidote now . - They don 't want the antidote . They wanna make it a weapon . If we let it go , we will never get it back . You have no idea how powerful this thing is . I hate the government as much as anyone . But you 're being a little paranoid , don 't you think ? Bruce , Bruce . Get out . Where is it ? Come on , where is it ? Show him to me . Blonsky . Miss , take this . If you took it from me , I 'm gonna put you in a hole for the rest of your life . Betty . I will never forgive what you have done to him . - He 's a fugitive . - You made him a fugitive . To cover your failures and to protect your career . Don 't ever speak to me as your daughter again . It 's only because you 're my daughter that you 're not in handcuffs too . Are you telling me you can make more like him ? No , not yet , I 've sorted out a few pieces but it 's not like I can put together the same Humpty Dumpty . If that 's what you 're asking . He was a freak accident . The goal is to do it better . So Banner is the only ... Now , she 's an annoying bitch . Why are you always hitting people ? Now , what possibly could I have done to deserve such aggression ? It 's not what you 've done , it 's what you 're gonna do . I want what you got out of Banner , I want that . You look like you 've got a little something in you already , don 't you ? I want more . You 've seen what he becomes , right ? I have . And it 's beautiful . Godlike . I want that . Need that . Give me that . I don 't know what you 've got inside you already . The mixture could be an abomination . I didn 't say I was unwilling . I just need informed consent . And you 've given it . This is what I was trying to explain . I don 't know what you 've been ladling into yourself . But clearly it worked . Let 's assume you don 't understand a word I 'm saying but if you 'll just get back on the table I can fix this . Shoot it ! No ! Delta 4 to leader . They still got two of our guys . Two of our guys Blonsky and the major , are still inside . Come on , move , move , move . It 's over there ! - What is that thing ? - Shoot it ! Okay , all right . You , you drive . Let 's go . Move , move . Delta 4 to leader . Something big just went off down here . General , you should hear this . The hulk is in the street . I repeat , the hulk is in the street . That 's impossible . You get ahold of yourself . You get it together . What is your position ? 121 st Street , heading north on Broadway . Turn us around . We 're going back . Why are we going back ? Damn it , give me eyes down there . Yes , sir . What the hell was that ? Go , go , go . No . One of yours ? Oh , my God . What have you done ? Fire ! Fire ! You think a rifle 's gonna hurt that ? Come on . Sweet . Get out of there , soldier . Stand back ! Give me a real fight . No , no , no ! Sir ? Sir ? Tell them to bring everything they 've got and head for Harlem . It has to be me . - You have to take me back there . - What are you saying ? You think you can control ... No , no , not control it , but , I don 't know , maybe aim it . And what if you can 't ? We made this thing . All of us . Please . - Land us near it . - No , no . No , keep us high . Open the back door . Bruce . Bruce , stop . Stop . What are you doing ? Think about this . You don 't even know if you 'll change . You don 't have to do this , please . This is insane . Betty , I 've gotta try . I 'm sorry . Oh , shit . Get her in here . Come on , miss . There . Betty . Hulk . Come on . Is that all you 've got ? Use that thing , soldier . Give him some help . Which one ? Help the green one , damn it . Which one do you think ? Cut the other one in half . Ross . Keep it on him . I gotta put it down . Hang on . Dad . Are you hurt ? Let me help you . I 'm all right . Just find a way out . You don 't deserve this power . Now watch her die . Look out ! General . Any last words ? Hulk smash ! Stop ! It 's okay . Betty . Reload . Reload . The smell of stale beer and defeat . You know , I hate to say I told you so . But that super soldier programme was put on ice for a reason . I 've always felt that hardware was much more reliable . Stark . General . You always wear such nice suits . Touché . I hear you have an unusual problem . You should talk . You should listen . What if I told you we 're putting a team together ? Who 's we ?

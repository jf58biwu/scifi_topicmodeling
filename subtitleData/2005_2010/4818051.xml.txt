What are you thinking about ? I 'm not thinking at all . This is Dan you 're talking about ... But ... But ? It 's like there 's this big confused muddle . In my chest . but I can 't relax . Giants and Underground and Turbine City and disbanding ... What the hell is wrong with me ? Shit ! shit ! calm down ! Be worried and calm ! Mr. Dan feels something too . So did that build your character any ? Worrying is what makes us all grown-ups ! Shut up ! This is very tight security . I appreciate the Lunatic Corporation 's help . No one can hijack your cannon now . There 's no time . The first manifestation will appear any day now . Yes . Did the stones speak to you ? Is the plan on schedule ? We 'll use Eclipse 's songs to activate the ultinium ore . Once we do ... I 'll be able to hear the voice of the stones again . Yes . Your Majesty is the last remaining Speaker . you are absolutely essential . Essential ? Your people will long remember your greatness . but Earthdash and the Moon when two worlds would have collided . I expect great things . Please leave it to me .

But will they be okay without a proper rehearsal ? Oh ! That is their rehearsal . Violette . For the legend ... we have to hang tough . I know . I know ... that 's why Rouge wanted the upgrade . There 's no turning back now . Whatever it takes to become the true legend ... Do it . Mr. Dan . Sorry ! The Dangan and your Zephyr can 't be moved just yet . okay . Use that if you want . We 'll catch up after I 'm done with the maintenance . Leave now and you can still catch him . Hang in there . Okay ! Alan . What is Yan trying to do with Eclipse ? but we 'll carry on with the plan . There 's not much time left to us . I 'll keep searching Earthdash for legend candidates until the very last minute . What about my brother ? The Executive Council saw the last match and granted permission to induct Dan . But how will he get to the Moon ? They can 't commandeer the Moon Cannon again . That 's true . But we aren 't out of tricks yet . Why do you keep following me ? Because I 'm worried ... I 'm worried for Rouge too . Y-Yeah . Alan . Mr. Dan . Don 't call me Mr. Dan . Um ... What are you going to do when you see Rouge ? Mr. Dan ? I dunno . You don 't know ? I 'll use this time to think it over . It 's just ... this muddle in my chest might go away . I get that feeling . isn 't she ? Yeah . And she 's a girl . Yeah . So ? I just think ... I just feel ... All I know is I 'm going to see Rouge . so that 's just a waste of time . Hang in there . but ... The stadium is complete . Professor Thousand ? All we need now to activate the ore and extract the legendo balletto is Dan JD . There 's no doubt that Dan will come . He will herald the birth of the legend . my voice doesn 't reach them . No one 's voice does . and grown strong ... Flora ? Dammit . Why do I have to wear this again ? A stunningly ugly development ! There 's a price on our heads for hijacking the Moon Cannon . We can 't get across the border unless we go in disguise . prices on our heads for a little thing like that ... aren 't they ? certainly . Stupid-ugly-head ! Shut up ! You little ... Stop it ! Being ugly is the best thing about you ! Wh-What do you think ? About what ? About ... About ... Huh ? get out your ID . yeah . Mr. Dan ? Keep your voice soft or you 'll give us away . I got it . look at that ! What the ? It doesn 't look like me at all . it captures you perfectly ! Your ugly side . Who 're you calling ugly ? It doesn 't look like me ! ugly ! No it doesn 't ! be quiet ! ugly ? I said it doesn 't look like me ! Look good and hard ! That poster and the real Dunk Mask look nothing alike ! Idiot ! It 's Dunk Mask ! Get him ! There 's a reward ! Dumbass ! You gave us away ! stupid-head . What do we do ? Their security 's getting heavier and heavier . Isn 't there some other point we could cross ? The whole city perimeter is locked down . There will be guards ' eyes gleaming at every corner . The underground stream ! Underground stream ? It flows from the mountains to beneath the city . so it 's extremely dangerous . I said it was dangerous ! right ? ! Balls ? Alan ! Ahead ! Spanky ! Are you okay ? you 're bony . Are you eating enough ? Y-Yeah . He 's here . Dan 's here . He came to see you . how is Rouge 's condition ? There 's no cause for concern . She 'll go directly to the stadium .

Is that the only reason ? Shit ! Dunk Mask ! why choose basquash ? You never shut up . It 's because basquash ... Because basquash doesn 't lie ! Basquash . A world with no undersides and no facades . and you 're ricocheted back . Where you play notes of the entire musical scale . and you take your own crooked path . That in itself is a way of living . The true embodiment of living with your whole heart and soul . That is basquash ! are you awake ? Princess . It appears I 've come to the end of my journey . a new journey will begin .

 Tell me your secret recipe for erasing Owen 's addiction . Insert a protein that inhibits dopamine beta-hydroxylase , right in the addiction part of the brain . I do it once and his genes do the work forever . Is this about Owen ? Because Arroyo said , you try this on human being , you should be arrested . You 'd be jumping off a cliff , Owen . I can do what I want . Where are you Sinatra ? The Boston patients are all parents of infants . But somewhere in the world it 's a very common disease . It 's so common that every baby is exposed to it . Sinatra is Filipino virus C-2 . There was a guy from the Sinatra society who traveled ... - to the Philippines . - Tell me . Mark Smith , with a " k " . And he bought a ticket to Boston . He was killed in a car accident 3 weeks ago . - What ? - Mark Smith did not bring it to Boston . I mean , this guy , he 's not sick . - No , he 's just dead . - We 've got the beginnings of a pandemic and we don 't have a clue . We have 14 upstairs in ICU . 10 serious , 4 critical and then we come to this group . The most recently infected . And it 's spreading much faster than we 'd like . Dr. Serrano , Dr. Sandström . Thank you for coming . Ladies , gentlemen , this is the lead team from NorBAC . Did you hear that Sinatra 's broken out in Florida ? - Big time in Tallahassee . - Any links with us or at Boston ? I 'd get your epidemiologist exchanging symptomology . We 'll do . Do you mind finishing up the show and tell for these new residents ? We 're pulling up all the help we can get . There 's a conference room just down the hall , they 'll show you . Sure . - After you . - Go ahead . Okay , we think the Sinatra virus hides out in the body 's organs and pops up to trigger a lethal immune response . You all up to speed with that ? We 're using a regimen of immunosuppressants . Get that ? We 're turning down their immune systems . Just trying to stabilize them . This is a hospital right ? I mean , new bugs walk in every hour . They 're susceptible to staph infections , C. difficile , E.coli , rotavirus , crypto . They 're human Petri dishes , right ? They could die of something else . But right now we 're just trying to keep them alive . That ladies and gentlemen is a snapshot of science in the 21st century . Knowing just enough to know how little you know . Let 's get back to work . - What ? - Here 's where we are on the antivirals . - Shoot . - Now that I 'm sure it 's a beta-herpes , I 'm testing combinations with Idoxuridine and Docosanol . Stanford 's trying combos of Cidofovir and Foscarnet . Yeah and Boston 's all over Tromantadine . - Hear anything back from them yet ? - No . What I 'd like to do is get some next generation drugs that are in the pipeline in Switzerland . Supposedly very promising . - Need any help ? - I 'm trying my own channels but if you 've got anything , go for it . I 'll make some calls . We 're sending you blood and tissue sample from Mark Smith . You want SNPs and virus detection analysis ? - All the organs . - Still think he 's our smoking gun ? Enough that I 'll be on the next flight home . ReGenesis 3x05 The God of Commerce Subtitles Team NorBAC Synchro Bbsiocnarf , Golgi , Lovechange Version NoTag 1.0 It 's been a long 6 months . Yes it has . I see you missed a couple of rehabs . Yeah , I 've been real busy but I 'm feeling good , Gordon . - You look good . - Thanks . So any ... post-traumatic stress ? - Nightmares , flashbacks ? - Not really . Yes . The problem with post-traumatic stress is that is pops up in disguise . The phantom figure in a dream . We don 't always make an immediate connection . I 'm not sure I know what you 're talking about . Inappropriate anger , irrational fears , night sweats , these things . Yeah , I 'm going with the key to happiness is a bad memory . It 's okay to get past it Mayko , it 's not okay to hide from it . What 's this about your legs ? I 've had some pain . You told the physio it felt like white-hot needles . That 's something . How often are you getting this sensation ? It 's not a sensation . My left leg feels like it 's on fire . - Any specific time of day ? - No , it 's random . What about body image issues ? Gordon , you know how I feel about this psychobabble stuff . You been intimate with anyone since the accident ? What does that have to do ? How you feel about yourself emotionally , physically , they are connected . - I just want you to think about it . - Okay . In the meantime ... Why don 't you try this for a couple weeks ? Benzodiazepine ? I don 't need anti-anxiety meds . - I 'm trying to treat your pain . - And you think it 's all in my head ? It 's real Gordon . Okay ? So can you write me up a Percocet or something ? - You think that 'll help ? - Yeah , I 'm in pain . Okay . I want you to keep me a pain journal though . Where you are and what you 're feeling when you ... go through one of these white-hot needles episodes ? Sure . I 'll just write a little note down while I 'm on the floor screaming and crying . Punctuation isn 't important . Bob ? - Can you hear me ? - Yep . What 's up ? I could use a second opinion in here . I 'll be right there . What are you ? So I 'm doing a PCR on these organs we got in from San Francisco . - Mark Smith . - There 's one organ I can 't recognize . That 's a gallbladder . Half a gallbladder actually . You can tell by the cystic duct . Testicle . They usually come in pairs . They 're not considered vital compared to a lung or heart or a liver . Right . But this one 's really got me stumped . What the hell is that ? Could you ... rotate to the left ? I don 't know . Are you sure it 's an organ ? Mystery meat . I don 't know . I 'll set it aside for now . Thanks . Sure . Just keep on it Rachel . We need those organ PCRs . Put on a pot of coffee . Hey there Owen . You look like shit . Hi . - Hi . - Hey , it 's David . I know . How you doing ? Good . Not good , Owen . You 're doing great . Show David how you can walk . Come on . That 's great Owen . Can I see you outside for a second ? Would you like anything ? Snack or juice ? That is everything you didn 't want to talk about . What ? It 's like he 's got Parkinson 's . Because it 's working . The dopamine pathways responsible for his addictive behaviours are shutting down as predicted . It looks like everything is shutting down . Well , we still have lots of tweaking to do . It 's been less than 72 hours , David . Parkinson 's specialist is coming on Friday . Great ! You 're gonna put him on Levodopa , the rest of his life ? David . This is the kind of pioneering science you used to rhapsodize about when I sat in your lecture ... I never rhapsodized about shoddy half thought out experiments . - This is a perfectible procedure . - Fine ! Perfect it on lab rats . - Owen is a human being . - Exactly . Eventually all new procedures have to been tried in people . He 's a fucking zombie ! Alright ? Now that used to be a beautifully screwed up teenager . Wasn 't that the whole problem ? I never should 've let you do this . - Let me ? ! - I could 've stopped you . That 's fine . I 'll take him . Thank you . Come here . That 's enough for today . Let 's get you back in bed okay ? That 's it . You 're doing great . What ? It 's Carl Riddlemeyer , David . Have I got you at a bad time ? - Always . - What ? I 'm afraid I lost you there for a minute . - What can I do for you , Carlton ? - I 'm calling with good news . I 'm sending NorBAC a new electron microscope . Top of the line , Zeiss Optics . - Why ? - Call it an olive branch . I 'm new to this job . I 'm finally understanding what NorBAC is about . What hit you on the head ? Well David , as you once reminded me yourself , clearly , my distinguished advisors don 't have a fucking clue what they 're doing . - Maybe on the golf course . - Well anyway ... When I 'm wrong I own it and I change course . Hope the Zeiss helps out . Yeah well ... Thanks . Weird . This is the Tallahassee update . Okay , good . Listen , did you clean up my shit in Washington ? That incident with you and Riddlemeyer at Camp Dalton ? Yeah , I put on my rubber gloves and did some heavy scrubbing . You 're welcome . - Where 's Rachel ? - Waiting for Mark Smith 's PCR results . Ok , let 's get started . Tallahassee : 6 dead , 16 sick . 3 new fatalities in Boston , 5 in San Francisco . Alright ! Mark Smith had Sinatra traces in his blood , concentration in 1 kidney . Guess we 're still in business . So what 've we got ? Our swinger Pete Braungart 's immune system was weakened because he had CGD . Babies in Boston and the Philippines get the virus but they don 't die from it because of their immature immune system . And now our new best friend Mark Smith carried the virus in his kidney but it did not manifest . Why not ? San Francisco medical records confirm he did not have CGD , was not on Interferon . What else ? Uh , childhood immunity . He didn 't look Filipino , where was he from ? Toledo . Maybe he spent part of his childhood in the Philippines and developed immunity . - Get on that . Look into his history . - No need . Rachel I want you to check for antibodies to any tropical diseases . That 'll let us know if he was there or not . Other reasons ? Maybe his immune system was weak . Undiagnosed HIV / AIDS . I 'll look into that too . If it was that serious , he 'd be medicated . Bob I want you to look for meds in his system . There was nothing indicated in his medical records . No , check him Bob . Maybe he didn 't tell anybody . Now have we been able to connect him to any of the patients in Florida or Boston ? No , not yet . And what was he doing in the Philippines ? I 'll keep crosschecking patient profiles for Tallahassee and Bean Town . I 'll chase down the Philippines connection . Very good . Rachel , I want you on diseases . Bob , you 're on meds . Carlos ... I 'd like to take another look at that virus . Let 's get to work . Test these blood samples for antibodies to Dengue , Malaria , HIV . Yes , any drugs or toxins . Thank you . And we 'll need the results as soon as possible . Thanks , have a good day . I 'm here in Sutter Washington with Dr. Joanna Sabean , regional case officer for the Centre for Disease Control . Dr. Sabean , I understand that mayor Alice Walker called in the CDC , saying it was raining dead birds . We 're testing 20 birds for avian flu but H5N1 is rarely found in wild fowl . - Exactly . - So it 's little likelihood ... What 's going on ? But if it is , could this be the start of something bigger , something we don 't know about ? Why is she trying to scare people like that ? - It 's TV news , that 's what they do . - Mayko , Mayko ! - The deliveries are here . - What deliveries ? - By a bike courier . - Oh , he 's here . - Yes . - Oh sorry . Excuse me . Sign here please . - Hey ! Milo . - Hey . Are you expecting something ? Don 't think this one is for you , is it ? No . - Well , what ? - Sorry , sorry . No I 'm just ... I 'm training for the Muskoka Ironman , right ? And so I 'm on my bike , like , 5 nights a week . I thought it might be fun to ... Go for a ride after work , together , sometime . So , after I 've been on my bike all day , I go for a bike ride just for fun ? - Is that what you 're saying ? - You could pace me . - I could do that I guess . - I mean , you know , if you wanted to . - Have you ever done the Rouge Valley ? - No , downtown boy don 't do valleys . I see . Well there 's a first time for everything . - What are we talking about ? - Tomorrow , after work ? Cool . You know where to find me . Here . Right ? Yeah . I 'll see you tomorrow . - Okay . Bye . - Okay ? Thank you . Sorry . - What 's with Mayko ? - She 's drooling over the bike courier . Can 't say that I blame her . - Rachel . - Yeah . What 'd you get out of those tissue samples ? No HIV , no Hep-C . - Well that was expected . - No signs of any prior infection with tropical diseases . So we can rule out a childhood in the Philippines . Maybe we could figure out what he was up to on his most recent visit . Wes is on it . Philippine immigration says Mark Smith never registered in a hotel . So , what was he doing there ? Exactly . - You got it ? - I got it . This is a SNPs analysis from Mark Smith 's pancreas ... His gallbladder ... And his kidney . No , that doesn 't match his DNA . - They gave you the wrong guy 's kidney . - And they sent along this . Oh ! Well that 's a um ... That 's a polycystic kidney , in very bad condition . Right ! The surgeons leave them in . Good work ! - Kidney transplant ? - That 's what I said . So Mark Smith had a kidney transplant from somebody who died of Sinatra ? Don 't think so . The donor probably looked healthy . Whoever the donor was probably had the disease as a child . He looked healthy but he was carrying a dormant virus . - But it woke up in Mark Smith . - So why wasn 't he sick ? He probably had mild symptoms like cold but the immunosuppressants that were keeping his body from rejecting the kidney transplant kept his immune system from overreacting . He was just sick enough to infect others . I don 't see how the person who did the transplant didn 't notice the virus . It 's impossible to see without a DNA or an RNA test . - So Mark Smith is patient zero ? - No , the donor is patient zero . If this was a multiple donor then that would explain outbreaks in Boston and Tallahassee . - A liver here , a lung there . - That makes sense . Now we 've just got to back it up with facts . I want you to run a mitochondrial DNA analysis of Mark Smith 's kidney transplant . Look for geographical and ethnic origins . Right . - Where 's Bob with the toxicology tests ? - He 's not back yet . I 'll check the transplant lists in Boston and Tallahassee . Katarina was the first to die . She must 've known a transplant recipient . If she did , I 'll find ' em . Mayko , I need you to check the patients . See if they had any contact with a transplant recipient . We might have a dozen more human time bombs out there ready to go off . Alright . What 's the time ? - 3 minutes , 10 . - Oh shit , I 've gotta break 3 . Hey Mayko , don 't kill me in the process okay . Sorry . What 's that ? There . Oh , it 's Golani Brigade . - You were in the Israeli army ? - Yeah . Before university when I was 18 , I went over there . After basic training I spent a year in the occupied territories . Kind of came back a different person . Like ? Like I applied to the Munk Centre for International Relations . - And give up being a bike courier . - I know , you know . Most people , they don 't see past the bike courier . You know . They look at me and think I 'm ... I don 't know , like some kind of monkey or something like that . Well quit whining monkey . I 'm still trying to find a life outside of work . Okay , let 's ride . Hang on . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . It 's okay . Oh fuck . - What happened ? - I just got ... I just slipped . It 's from the bomb . - You want me to help you out ? - No . It 's okay . I 'm okay . I had no idea . - I 'm so sorry . - It 's okay . It 's ... Why ? My God , people were blown to bits . This is ... This is nothing . I 'm never really quite sure how to mention it though , you know ? Hi , I think you 're hot and I 've got an amputated leg . This is not ... Is this too weird for you ? Too weird ? No . No . After what I saw in the army this is ... this is normal tuesday afternoon stuff . - You wanna get up ? - Yeah . Thank you . You good ? - What 's up ? - So , I did both a Y-DNA , and MT-DNA haplotype tests . Both the R1A1 and HVR2 haplogroups suggest that the kidney came from a male of Asian origin . - There you go . - And Bob found Rapamune , which is an immunosuppressant used by transplant patients in the blood . - So it 's transplant tourism eh ? - Looks like it . Another thing . Mayko found that 2 of the sick people in Tallahassee had the same dentist . He was on sick leave for 2 months and just recently came back . - Did they pick him up yet ? - No . His wife wants us to talk to her lawyer . Don 't dentists take precautions ? But masks and gloves are useless if you 're not trained to put them on properly like , not use your hands . What have you got Wes ? I had the FBI check into Mark Smith 's credit card records . - Remind me to tell you about the birds . - Birds ? - A favour for a friend of mine . - Okay . 4 months ago there was a 15,000 $ deposit - 15,000 bucks ? - That 's just the deposit . For $ 140 000 they will find you a new kidney . - You want a heart , that 's 290 . - Is that legal ? Well it 's just a service so technically , yes . As long as you 're not buying an actual organ . Alright . How do we ... - They 're in Vegas . - Figures . Call them . - I 'd like to sit with him face to face . - Why ? Because the last time I called him he hung up on me . Oldsquaw . You can tell by the black and white head and the markings , - the short beak and the pointed tail . - Beautiful . I love the smell of formaldehyde . Reminds me of my marriage . What do you mean ? Nothing , it 's a dumb joke . I 'm just in the middle of a very messy break-up . I can relate . My mom and I didn 't speak for a month once . So parasites , what kind ? Rice breast . Sarcocystosis . You guys see this CDC bulletin ? No new reported cases of Sinatra . - We contained it . - For now we have . So , we can focus on a vaccine ? Focus on a vaccine . What 's with the birds ? Carlos wants us to do a virus check . - From Washington State . - What ? A friend of his wants us to check for any type-A avian virus jumpers , 2000 candidates . What friend ? I don 't know . He said he was talking to you about this . Right ! Yeah . The birds , the birds . He never got around to it . Hey Bob , you in tonight ? - Totally in . - You play poker , Rachel ? You like ribs ? If you cook ' em right . Give her directions to my place . See you tonight . Okay . That 's very interesting . He didn 't even ask you to bring the baked beans . - You make coleslaw ? - To die for . It 's gonna be fun . Mayko , I thought we were here to play poker . But listen to me ! Every 30 seconds an African kid dies of Malaria . - Ok ? - Yes . Do you know that that is a million a year ? Nations ' wars , they 're about as irrelevant as a sports page . Come on . The Middle East could blow sky-high tomorrow ! It 's a regional hiccup . Sorry , 5 million kids a year die of diarrhea , measles , easy stuff to cure . That is the real problem in the world . - Is Iran building a nuclear bomb ? - I don 't know , but global warming is causing hurricanes and floods and crop failures . And huge refugee populations that are vulnerable to pandemics ! - Right . - I am talking about a massive die-off that will change the course of life on this planet . - Right . So am I ! - Global pestilence ! Right . Global warfare ! We 're dealing with a lit fuse here . I need the names of every person you sent to the Philippines for a transplant . I 'm bound by the confidentiality agreements I sign with all my clients . Just give me the name of the clinic in Manila . I don 't send people to clinics . I send them to a broker who makes the local arrangements . What kind of a bullshit business are you running ? Well we 've created a very efficient market that matches buyers and sellers . Hit me . So what 's with the birds ? A friend of mine from the CDC . Hit me . I put a report on your desk . - Carlos , cuida tu lenguaje . - Oh , excuse me . - Carl called after you left . - How 's the divorce going ? - It reminds her of formaldehyde . - No this was strictly business . He wants me to hand over all the Sinatra data to Klay BioMedical in Baltimore . It 's a pretty good vaccine lab . He used to sit on the board of directors . Carlton called to ' nice ' me on the telephone the other day . Well , sure . 3 major cities need the vaccine now , so there 's a pile of cash in it for whoever gets it out there . Give him all our data . You want me to copy Jenner Pharma , Norton Rab ? That 's a good idea . May the best lab win . Here 's how it 's gonna go down , Regis . I 've got CNN on my speed dial . I 'll call my contacts at the NY Times and I will have this story planted : " Go to the Philippines with Transplantfacilitator . " Get a black market organ and watch your family die a terrible death . " Look , Skip , you don 't scare me . I 'm not finished . It 's totally corrupt and disgusting . It 's supply and demand , Carlos . Bare-knuckle capitalism . Kidney , who 's got a kidney ? I heard that in Manila , when cops shoot a criminal , they harvest organs - before contacting next-of-kin . - Come on . What about the thousands of helpless people on waiting lists for organs ? I mean , 15 % of them die . - Well , thus the grey market . - Black market . Then I 'm gonna get a top class action lawyer and I am gonna put him in touch with the families of all the victims . You 'll never stop people in poor countries from selling their organs to the rich . A healthy lung will feed a family of 5 for months . Spoken like a true compassionate conservative . How do we help the poor we buy their organs ? Well , the price is right . There are victims in 3 states . That 's 6 senators and a whole busload of congressmen . I 'll make sure that there are public hearings . It 's gonna cost your company ... millions of dollars to fight this . How do you regulate people in India who get hit on the head and wake up with - a scar where their kidney used to be ? - How do you feel about women selling their placentas for stem cell research ? Well , that 's out of bounds . Hypocrites ! - It 's a theological issue . - Faith-based science ? Not in my shop . A cell is a cell is a cell . Not in the eyes of the Creator . - Are you done ? - I am . The king of kings holds . You 're gonna go down , Reg . I promise you that . The question is : Do you wanna go down hard or would you like me in your corner to help you down smoothly ? Keep it simple . - This is really depressing , isn 't it ? - Come here . See , I kind of find it oddly arousing . Mayko ? I don 't really feel like poker . Mayko ! What do you have , Rachel ? 21 ! Divine intervention . The invisible hand of the free market . - How much ? - 60 bucks . How much a beggar in Karachi could get for a chunk of his liver . Your deal , Bob . It 's been a long time ? - Is it that obvious ? - No , no , it 's just ... We , we got all the time in the world . I want you ... Right now . Oh my god ! You okay ? You okay ? What happened , Mayko ? What happened ? What 's the matter ? I get ... I , oh god ! I get these shooting pains . - Below the knee . - Okay , just come here . It 's right ... - It 's right ... Yeah . - Right here ? Right here ? Look , I know I 'm a head case . Just rub the thing , please . Okay . I 'm sorry , I just ... This is fucking crazy . May ... Mayko ! Dios mio ! Mira quien esta aqui . - It 's good to see you . - You too . You look good . - You too . How was your trip ? - It was good . Come , let 's go in the conference room . They were right . I checked the results myself . It 's not bird flu . I know , but there 's more to this . What ? I really think , and I know you 're gonna think this sounds crazy . What , Joanna ? I think there 's some kind of cover-up going on . Another conspiracy . - Don 't patronize me , Carlos . - Joanna ... Sorry , am I interrupting ? No . This is Joanna , an old friend of mine . We were residents together at Duke . - David Sandström . - Head Scientist at NorBAC . Pleasure . What brings you here ? The birds in Washington . Joanna is the regional caseworker for the CDC . I 've only been on the job 6 months . I saw the story on the news . No H5N1 though , right ? But what 's not on the news is that there 's also sick people . What kind of sick people ? High fever . Spasticity . Convulsions . Loss of sensation in the extremities . Sounds like meningitis . It 's not . The official line is the birds are not infecting humans . Once we determined it wasn 't H5N1 , Governor Gibson called my superior in Washington . The next thing I know , my investigation 's been shut down . Why ? Tourist season . Joanna is famous for jumping to conclusions . Maybe 15 years ago . Don 't worry about it . He says the same thing about me . The birds and the people are still sick . If it 's not avian flu , what is it ? - Could it be environmental ? - Well , exactly ! And that strand of my investigation is being shut down by the EPA . First the CDC . Now the EPA . What do you think 's going on ? Whatever it is , it stinks . I don 't care if it costs my job . And I 'm not being impetuous . Alright . What do you want from us ? I 'm a nobody at the CDC . You guys have pull . I need your help . Okay . I 'll find Bob , see what he 's got . Great . - Coffee ? - Tea . You want me to weigh in on your behalf at the CDC . You know anyone there ? I know how to get Carl Riddlemeyer . Cream and sugar ? Sugar . The new science czar . Really ? He 's new to the job . Doesn 't know shit from shinola . He 'll do anything to avoid bad publicity . Right , Rachel ? - Hi . I 'm Rachel Woods . - Joanna Sabean . Joanna is the one who sent us the birds . Now the CDC is trying to shut her up . It 's a weird time . Bush hates science . That doesn 't agree with what his neo-con cronies tell him . Well , that 's a bit of an oversimplification , but ... He 's taken an axe to every research department that isn 't dedicated to the Defense . All the good people are leaving . The ones that stay are ass-kissers . I 'll be sure and tell my friends who stayed . You 're not the type that holds back , are you ? What good does it get ya ? Guys . Bob 's ready for us . - Right this way . - Thanks . Carlos . How well do you know her ? No , don 't even think about it . It was that obvious , eh ? Like a dog chasing hot tires . Ah man . That is one exceptionally beautiful public health official . - Yes , she 's very pretty . - No . Daffodils are pretty . She is something else entirely . We got a fractional chemical analysis on this Double-Crested Cormorant . A wonderful , graceful bird by the way . It can dive and feed at a 100 feet for 5 minutes . And this ... a Hooded Merganser . The readings were extreme . - Methyl mercury . - ' Scuse me . They 've never seen concentrations like this . They 're off the dial . No , it 's not . Oh , hi ! Sorry , how 'd you get past security ? Israeli commando . We can walk through walls . Look , I uh , I called . - I left a message , like , twice . - Yeah , I know . I 'm sorry . I just ... I kinda felt weird about - the whole thing . - Okay . I know how you feel . And don 't ! Okay ? - I , but Milo , I ... - Just ... Look ... You 're amazing . And that 's all I wanted to say . And ... I don 't know , you know , and ... - Oh god . - Oh , there 's security . I could take him out but I 'm just gonna go . - And I 'll ... Just call me , okay ? - Okay . Yeah ? See ya . So that 's it ? If Katarina Zvorkovec was the last link , that 's it . She was his mistress for a little over a year . - What kind of transplant did he get ? - Small bowel transplant . So that 's it . Good work busting Mr. Transplant , by the way . To tell you the truth , I rather enjoyed myself . You 're turning into a regular rat terrier , Wes . I 'll take that as a compliment . Step up from a rat . Speaking of which ... Alright . That went extremely well . Image is everything . Well , I like the image I can get with an electron microscope , so I 'll shut up . As long as I 'm here , what 's this about corruption in the EPA and the CDC ? - You talked to Rachel ? - And I made a couple of calls . I don 't see the problem . You don 't see doors slamming on a junior person seems have a pretty good case a problem ? My understanding is that the CDC said that there was no Avian Flu outbreak . - Did your lab not confirm that ? - Yes but ... Did NorBAC not agree with this finding ? We found massive levels of mercury contamination in those birds . - EPA was slow off the mark , granted . - Granted ? ! That 's nice and goddamn convenient . Let 's keep it nice and calm . That 's the way I like to work . We 've got birds and possibly people loaded with lethal levels of mercury . We 've got to find out where it 's coming from . No one is questioning the need for an investigation . Indeed , Governor Gibson is a good friend of mine . He assures me that things will be handled locally . You know what ? I think your pal the Governor doesn 't want anybody fucking with his tourist season . We 're going out there tonight . Why don 't we strategize on this together ? Good idea . I 'll call you when I 'm there . Can 't believe you 're not even listening . - Why should I listen to this ? - Because I know him and you . No , correction ! You knew me 12 years ago ! I don 't think it 's appropriate in a professional setting to be having - a relationship with someone . - Fuck , that 's bogus latino machismo . Look ... - Sometimes David uses women . - And sometimes I can use men . So ? - You and your secrets . - My personal life is my personal life . What are you so afraid of ? Double-double . Carlos . Everything alright ? Just to clear the air , Joanna and I were married for 3 years . How could I not know this about you ? He has a very big closet . - She 's the one who kicked me out of it . - The marriage and the closet . Well , bravo to you . Thank you . Details ? I think you know enough . Man of mystery . He thinks that you and I have a lot in common . Really ? Timothy Bosch . Executive Assistant to the Governor . How old are you , Tim ? - 29 . - Wow . You 're moving fast . My father and Governor Gibson went to law school together . Nothing like a little nepotism to jump-start the all career , eh ? A lot of people are cynical about government . Not me . I want to make a difference . You 're gonna do that by babysitting us ? I just think , you 'll find that doors open a lot easier when you bring along the guy with all the keys . What do you think ? Timothy wouldn 't take my calls this time last week , so what 's not to like ? Alright . Well , don 't worry about it . We 'll lose him the moment his back is turned . - Where are we headed ? - Mountain View Hospital . We want to look at those patients that aren 't part of a massive cover-up . Classic Minimata presentation . - I 'll just wait outside . - Actually Tim , I think it would be good if you stayed right here . Get a first-hand account for the Governor . 20 parts per million . We could use this kid 's blood in a thermometer . I 'm going to need to see all the results from neurology . David , I think it 's better if I stay and ... - try to set up some kind of treatment . - Chelation therapy ? I don 't see an option . - Sorry , Chelation therapy ? - Oh , they ... put a chemical in his blood to sop up the mercury . So you can do something ? Well ... to a certain extent . But ... young Kyle here can look forward to many years of suffering before he finally gets cured . We gotta figure this out fast . We can see the others . Dwight and Gavin Leopold came in the other day . Neither one of them have been sick a day in their lives , so they say . - First time 's a bitch . - Yes . - Dwight ? - Yes . I 've brought in some specialists that wanna find out what happened to you . So they have to ask you a few questions . Alright with that ? - Kyle 's your grandson ? - Yes . - He go duck hunting with you ? - No , he 's too young . He stayed at home with his momma . - But he ate the duck ? - Yeah . He loves it . The duck was contaminated with mercury . You 've been poisoned , so we need to know where the ducks came from . I 'm not a cop , Dwight . Where 'd you shoot the ducks ? Krauts . They fence off land I 've hunted my whole life . Bastards can 't keep us out . Elgin . The Elgin Wilderness was one of the last great tracts in the Cascades . Couple of years ago , a local consortium sold it to German casino operators . Pissed a lot of people off . Locals used to go hunting and fishing here . Now there 's a big fence . Around 90 square miles of the most beautiful country in the state . - They only got 150 million for this ? - Plus a share of the revenues . So Dwight and his buddies came hunting up here . Okay , the ducks are what ? They , they summer here ? And then what ? They come to the lake to feed ? - Weeds and fish could be laced with it . - The lake 's the source of the mercury ? I 'm say it 's a pretty good candidate . But there 's no way . EPA would have had to have tested the water as part of the land sale . Surely , they would have found it . Maybe they missed something . Got any more doors you wanna open for us , Tim ? I gotta get that ! - What ? ! - Oh David , I need to speak to Joanna . Basically to tell her she was right about the EPA cover-up . That 's some sort of airborne contamination . I want you to get samples from each sites . Compare that to the mercury in water . We find a match , we 'll find out who 's milfing Mother Nature . Governor Gibson is part of an investment group that sold that tract of land to a casino and resort developer over 3 years ago . You feel like coming up to Toronto for a visit anytime soon ? - Not really . - We may never see each other again . That 's what makes it so hot . You 're experiencing a phenomenon known as phantom limb pain . This is not a phenomenon Gordon . I told you the pain is real . Conventional medicine isn 't gonna solve what 's going on up here . I got the head office call . They 're taking me off the Mercury case . - When did this happen ? - They need help with a ... C. difficile outbreak in a hospital in Racine , Wisconsin . That was the hospital in Racine . Joanna 's in quarantine there . She 's infected with CDAD .

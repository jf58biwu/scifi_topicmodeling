 My name is Detective Brett Hopper . And this is the day that changes everything . You 're under arrest for the murder of assistant DA Alberto Garza . I will be framed for murder . Who the hell are you , people ? My girlfriend Rita will be in danger . I know all this because I am living the same day over and over again . The day is the same , but different things happen . Everyday I get another chance . For every decision , there 's a consequence . But last time I changed the day , I made it worse . I 'm not the one that 's different , this morning . It 's you . You 're not the same guy I went to sleep with last night . Rita doesn 't trust me . She 's hiding something . Maybe we know a few things you don 't . My dad 's old partner Nick might know what it is . They 'll own you , just like they do me , your girlfriend ... Everybody 's got secrets . Someone found the body . So I 've got to learn Rita 's secret ... We 're looking for a guy , name of Billy Foster . - So you followed her to the motel . - What was the name of the motel ? ... and figure out how she 's connected to all this . Your girlfriend 's got a secret , that 's all . You don 't know what you 're talking about . It 's tough keeping tabs on a girl like that . He shot Shelten 5 times and shot your girlfriend another 3 . - What was the name of the motel ? - Everybody 's got secrets , kid . I need your keys and your phone . What the hell are you talking about ? You 're being car-jacked . - Shelten ? - Chad , it 's Hopper . Hiya , Hopper . Too bad you left . You 're missing quite a party . Listen to me . Do not , under any circumstances , take Rita anywhere near a motel , today . - Do you understand me ? - A motel ? What are you implying ? I 'm telling you , if you take her to a motel , you 're both gonna die . - Is that a threat ? - No . I 'm trying to save Rita 's life . He said that he was being framed - and that I was in danger . - Of course he did . You said he mentioned the name Garza ? Rita ? Are you okay ? Shouldn 't you be out canvasing the neighborhood or something ? Yeah , I think we got that covered , thanks . I will ask you to come down to the station , make a formal statement . I 'll take her . Suit yourself . Chad , you don 't have to . I 'm sorry I even called you this morning . Just something felt wrong . No , don 't be sorry . What you were feeling this morning is intuition . You were right to call me . Everything 's gonna be OK , today . I promise . What the hell are you doing here , D. ? How do you know Nick ? The man reached out when you didn 't . What are you talking about ? - It 's got nothing to do with you . - I got a call from Nick , last night . An ex-cop ... Telling me that my ass was about to get hit at the safehouse . Now , what I 'm wondering is how come that call didn 't come from the cop who 's supposed to be looking out for my ass ? How would you know about a hit on a federal witness , Nick ? I still got friends , kid . Yeah , you mean friends like Booth ? Let me deal with this . He 's family . Alright . I gotta go see some family myself . What are you doing here ? What can you tell me about Rita Shelten ? - Rita who ? - Don 't play games with me , Nick ! I haven 't seen you in months ! You come on in here , throwing these names at me ! What the hell 's wrong with you ? Give me some answers or you 're gonna get a bullet in your head . I wouldn 't do that . Damn ! You know , for a big dude , you 're pretty light on your feet , Hippo . I don 't know what 's got into you today , kid . But your dad meant a lot to me , so I 'm just gonna pretend this never happened . I recommend you do the same . It 's time to go . Nice car you got here . It 's a loaner . Hope you got AAA . TRACKING MODE ( del vo ) Chad ... You know , I can be in there with you . In the interrogation room ... if you want me to be . Thanks . Calm down . Is that Hopper ? OK , yes . Slow down . I know where that is . Okay . I 'll be there as soon as I can . Who was that ? Billy . - Let me guess , he needs money . - No . He said they found the body . No , he 's lying . He 's trying to draw you into something . I don 't think he is . Chad , we should go to him . First , you got to get the statement over with . The last thing we need to do is attract attention . Then , we 'll deal with Billy . I don 't know ... He 's really upset . I was there for you before , I 'm here for you now . We 'll take care of this . Together . Come on . Hey , it 's me . I guess you weren 't kidding about that Garza thing . They dragged Rita in and grilled her about you . Is Chad with her ? Sergeant Fast-track ? Yeah . He 's not leaving her side . Good . Listen , I need you to pull a couple of favors from your friends at county . Run Rita 's name to their system . This is when I ask you why and you give me a really good answer . She was involved in an incident back in 02 . A traffic stop that went sideways . I think that may be linked to whatever 's going on today . You 're saying that Rita has something to do with the Garza hit ? No , not Garza , but somebody connected to him . A county sheriff named Buchalter . He 's the one who pulled her over . I need to know what went down , that night . Okay , I 'll see what I can find . Alright . Call me back at this number . Watch yourself , partner . Alright . tracking mode ( del vo ) This isn 't the first time that you 've been unsure about someone 's whereabouts , is it Miss Shelten ? Speaking of ... Curtis Foster . No . Not going there . You were brought in for questioning back in 02 . I said we are not going there . The way you 're reacting , let me think youhave something to hide . You wanna ask her about Hopper , do it . She 's not the one accused , here . We 've got the murder weapon with Hopper 's print . We 've got an eyewitness who puts him at the scene . Now , is it possible he snuck out last night while you were sleeping ? I don 't know . I guess anyone 's capable of anything . We need to talk . This isn 't a good time . I 'm on my way to a rally to see if you were right about our dear friend Alberto Garza . I need five minutes . You 've got two . I know what you did to Garza . I don 't have that kind of pull , Nick , you give me too much credit . You get me too little , if you think I 'm gonna swallow that load of bull . I found your little toy on my car . What 's that ? Please ... Your tracking device . You and him planning on shuting me up , like you did Garza ? Is that why you 're here ? You 're afraid something 's going to happen to you ? I actually came here to do you a favor . That Damien Ortiz kid . The one from the safe house . I can give him to you . And what would be in it for you ? Peace of mind . I want to get on my boat and not look over my shoulder the rest of my life . I want out . Out ? After all this time ? The time in front of me is what i 'm looking at . I ain 't get much left . What 's this ? The thing you asked for . A place to stash the girl when you grab her . It 's clean . Untraceable to us . The guy will adore . Whatever you do with her , I don 't want to know about it . Crap ! - Crap ! - You dropped this . Margo ? Who is that ? No one . Hey , this is Rita . Leave the message . Rita , it 's me . You 're in danger . I can 't explain it but don 't go anywhere near a motel , today . I know it sounds strange , but please , baby , you 've got to trust me on this . No motels ... Hey , Rits . Thanks for- - What 's he doing here ? I saved your ass last time , remember ? I told you to come alone . - They know everything . - Who does ? Shelten ... it 's been a while . - Hopper ? - Yeah . Did you find anything ? Yeah , I sure did . October 2002 . T stop in Simi Valley , the driver was Rita Shelten , and the report was signed by deputy Buchalter , pulling over for a busted tail light . Ok . And ? Keep going . - That 's it . - That can 't be it . There 's something else . What was in the trunk ? Why did Buchalter draw his gun ? There 's no mention of any of that in the report . They 're covering something up . Here 's something they didn 't cover up . They called Rita in for questioning a couple of days later . For what ? Disappearance of a Curtis Foster . That name ring a bell ? Curtis Fo- - No . Ho , that 's weird . The file just cuts off , like it 's half of something . Rita never mentioned any of this to you ? No , she 's hiding something from me . I gotta find her . What are you gonna do ? Get myself some leverage . If there was a problem you should have gone through me . You know this man ? Time to pay an old debt , Miss Shelten . That deal was between us . The deal is done by those who profit from it . Not just those who make it . - I thought you and Billy- - - Just listen to the man , OK ? We do what he says and we can go . Sit down and shut up , Billy . You know ... it is one thing to bury a body . And it 's quite an other to make it disappear . I don 't understand . Billy , you said somebody found the body . I don 't think Billy was told the truth . This man didn 't need to find the body . He helped us bury it . What do you want from us ? There 's going to be a lot of questions about Brett Hopper . You 're going to tell the police that he left your apartement in the middle of the night . You 're asking me to lie . You should be quite good at it . You 've had four years of practice . You awoke to see him living . And sometime later you saw him return . I can 't do that . - Of course you can . - No , she 's saying it 's too late . Rita already gave her official statement . You gave a statement ? And whose decision was that ? Why would that old cop set me up after saving my ass ? The only reason he saved you was so he could deliver you to Booth . See , you 're his insurance policy . - For what ? - His life . Nick is only after himself , man , he don 't care about nobody else . You , me , we 're just chips in his pocket . Alright , Hop . I know you aint drive all the way here to do me a favor . Sounds like you 've got a plan . Nick , still thinks you can trust him , right ? So then you can get close to him . How close ? We 're even , Hop . - You 're making a big mistake here , kid . - Where is Rita ? Who is this Rita ? Don 't lie to me , Nick . I 'm not lying . What do they have on her ? What is this big secret ? I swear on my life , I don 't know what you 're talking about . Your life doesn 't mean that much to me so you better swear on someone else . Look , you wanna take a run at Booth , that 's fine by me . I 'm just a ... - conduct of information . - Yeah , I 've got that . I guess that means you 'll give up anybody to save your own ass , huh ? Damien ... Me . I did what I had to do . Or Booth would 've hit me the way he hit Garza . I gotta say , kid ... I don 't know what 's shorter : your temper or your memory , after everything I did for your father . Who stepped in and took care of your family after he killed himself ? Who did your sister call ? Who cleaned up the scene ? Took care of the pension ? Wait ... I 'll make a deal . I get on my boat and disappear . You 'll never hear from me again . You got that right . - Wait ! - Shut up ! You had your chance . I swear I didn 't know it was her . You found the place where they 're stashing her ! You found it , I know this ! They were looking for a place to put her , - but I didn 't know it is Rita ... - Where ? 1012 VS Ombra . But he never said anything about hurting her . They 're going to kill her . - Not if she does what they 'll ask her . - I know it . I 've seen it . I 've known you since you were sixteen . Please ! Think of your dad , what would he say ? - Andrea . - Hopper , I was gonna call you . Okay . Rita is in danger , she 's at 1012 VS Ombra . How soon can you meet me ? They found her . What ? What 're you talking about ? They found Rita . But too late . She was with Chad . They are ... They 're both gone . No , it can 't ... No ... That 's ... I told Chad not to go . Where were they ? Tell me where they were ! They said they found them into some motel . It 's all I know . They 're at the coroner 's office . We have to go . DAY 2 ( del vo ) What 's wrong ? Nothing , I was gonna ask you the same thing . I 'm fine . I have to get ready for work . I was thinking maybe we could take the day off , today . I don 't think I can do that . We could drive up the coast . You 've always said you wanted to . When did I say I wanted to do that ? What are you doing ? I was ... My battery ... ran out so I was just switching mine out with yours . I charged that last night , I 'm gonna need that today . I got some important phone calls to make , so can I borrow your phone ? Well , just hurry up , then . I have to get going . Baby ! You ... want me to drive you work this morning ? I thought it 's out of your way . I figured we 'll spend a little time with each other , get a little breakfast . Why are you being so curly with me , this morning ? What was that ? Brett , I don 't really have time to do this . Be easy ! I just ... Wanna spend some time with you . Talk . - Is that my phone ? - Yeah , we must- - I got it . I got it . Hello ? Who is this ? I got it . Who is this ? Billy , slow down , you 're not making any sense . I 'm gonna call you right back . Everything OK ? Who 's Billy ? It 's no one , it 's somebody from work , it 's nothing . Work ? Who is it ? - It was just work . - She 's not here now . She 's not here ? Her shift started at 8 . She called in , said she was taking a vacation day . You 're keeping something from me . - I gotta go . - Wait ! I 'm sorry , wait ! I don 't have time , OK ? I just wanna know who Billy was and what that call was about . - None of your business ! - See , this is my business . - Let go of me , Brett ! - I can 't do that . I 'm serious ! If I let go of you , you will die . Let her go , sir . It 's alright , man . LAPD . We ... Then you should know not to grab a lady like that . Don 't touch me . Wait , Rita ! - Why don 't we just - take it easy ? - Let me handle this ! - Calm down ! - Don 't tell me to calm down ! Get your hands on the counter ! Hopper just got pinched . Yeah , got it . - Now what ? - Get into position and we wait . Just so you know , that girl is a witness in a homicide case . It she gets away , she 's gonna be in serious danger . Now do you want that on your head ? I need your phone . Rita , it 's me . Billy , it 's me . Where are you ? - Where ? - 1012 VS Ombra . Margo . It 's alright . I 'm here to help you . Alright ? - Oh my God ! - It 'll be OK . Alright , now can you tell me what happened here ? - Oh my God ! - Okay , look at me . Margo ... Look at me , breathe . Slow it down . I got you . It 's OK . Alright , there we go . Alright , now tell me . Where is Rita ? Who is Rita ? How do you know my name ? That 's a long story but ... I 'm a cop . My name is Detective Brett Hopper . Yeah , that 's what they said . They grabbed me at work . Two of them ! They said they were cops and they had badges just like that . What did these men want ? They wanted ... They wanted me to set up a meeting . At the courthouse , tomorrow morning . They gave me names to call over ... Six , I don 't ... Maybe seven other judges . Judges ? Yeah , a clerk for one . Nitzberg . And this judge , Nitzberg ... He 's your supervisor . Why would these men kidnap you just to set up a meeting ? I don 't know . Something to do with the grand jury investigation - he 's working on . - What 's it about ? Corruption at city hall . It 's all laid down in a ... In a sealed warrant . Alright , I don 't understand , I need to see it . Can you get me a copy of this warrant ? It 's locked up in Nitzberg 's chamber . Alright , listen to me , I 'm gonna call 911 , they 're gonna send a patrol car , you 're gonna be safe there , OK ? Alright ? Margo , look at me . I need that warrant . There 's someone else I need to find . You 're gonna be OK . Andrea , I need you to do some for me , go to Chad , and sell me out . You did the right thing , Battle . I 'll make sure your lieutenant knows about it . Gee , thanks . What 's happening ? Don 't do that . Give it up . Over here , nice and slow . Thanks , partner , I got it from here . My pleasure . Hey Battle ! I 'll make sure to tell your lieutenant about this , too . Don 't blame her . This was the only way I could talk to you . Plenty of time to talk in prison . - I 'll bring you a fruit cake . - Shut up and listen . Do you know where Rita is ? It 's funny you are asking me . - Why don 't you call her ? - She won 't take my calls . Yeah , she does have a temper . Although , the making-up part , - that- - - She 's gonna die , Chad . You 're threatening her ? 'Cause I 'll take you ... I 'm trying to save her . Now , I need your help . I don 't know what game your 're playing , Hopper ... I 'm not playing . Look , I know she 's been keeping a secret from me . A run that she had with a cop named Buchalter back in 02 . I also know she was questioned about the disappearance of a man the same year . Now , today , she gets a call from some guy named Billy . Some guy ? She didn 't tell you about Billy ? This is too good . You really don 't know . Billy 's her brother . I guess you two have grown real tight . At least , I knew who was in her family . Well , whoever he is , she is on her way to see him now . And if I don 't find out where ... she 's gonna die . So ... Just call her . Sorry , pal , can 't help you . Call her . Rita , it 's Chad . Chad , I was just gonna call you . It 's been an awful day . Brett is acting really weird , and Billy called . He said ... He said they found the body . Where are you ? I 'm at the Glen Capri motel in Glendo . You stay there , you don 't go in , ok ? You wait for me . Hey , sis . Come on , what do you know that you 're not telling me ? It 's not my place . Come on , guy , she is my girlfriend . She was my wife . We went through a lot together , if she wants to tell you , she can . What can you tell me about her brother ? - Billy ? - Yeah . Billy 's got the word loser , I bet it is in his DNA , he 's like a genetically engineered screw-up . What didn 't she tell me about him ? Maybe she didn 't want you to think the less of her . So she lied . Sometimes , a lie is the only way to protect someone you care about . I won 't lie to the police . Of course you can , you 've been doing it for four years . Look ... this comes out , we both go to jail . For me , that 's three strikes . So , I- - Brett was acting so strange at the diner . He knew . He was protecting me . What do you meam , " he knew " ? I don 't know who you are . But I don 't want any part of this . I 'm out of here . Rita , wait ! I would rethink my decision , Miss Shelten . Please . I have been protecting you your whole life , Billy . - Don 't leave me . - Every arrest , every screw-up . But I won 't do this . Let me talk to her . I can convince her . You know , I highly doubt that . But then I always did think it was a long shot . - Yes , sir . - Didn 't go well . She 's headed your way . How do you want it to go down ? Make it public : car-jacking . Corner of Region and Queen , get her face on tape . Understood . What do you mean , car-jacking ? You 're not gonna hurt her ? For every decision , there 's a consequence . Look , let 's talk about this . Decision ... Consequence . Bitch . Billy , where is she ? Where is she ? What are you , crazy ? You OK ? Come on . Thanks . No , I owed you one . Those men just tried to kill us . - Oh my God , Billy ! - He 's fine . We told him to leave town . Where do you think you 're going ? We gotta move , man . We gotta stay here and explain all this when back-up gets here . Well , good luck with that . Get in the car . I can 't let you leave Hopper . Chad , what are you doing ? He just saved your life . He 's also a wanted fugitive . What the hell is wrong with you ? He 's innocent , it 'll all sort itself out down at the station . - If not ... - If not ? What do you want to do ? I 'm sorry , Chad . We 're leaving . You 're not gonna to stop us . Let 's go . It should just take him two hours before he finds and knows . You okay ? I should have trusted you . I should have told you a long time ago . Told me ... ? About my dad . About how Chad and I got caught up in all of this . My dad was ... He drank . And when he got mean ... He took it out on Billy . And Billy ... fought back . I did . Billy called me , scared . When I got to the house ... my dad had almost beaten him to death . I swear , he was gonna finish him off . So I saw ... this big flashlight ... I didn 't think I hit him that hard ... You were protecting your brother . But we were so sure that we were gonna go to jail . He already had a record so ... we decided to get rid of the body ourselves . That 's when Buchalter pulled you over . Yeah , I freaked out . So I did the only thing I could think of , I called Chad . And he showed up ... And he talked to the cop and he ... He took care of it . And I know how you feel about your father . Being a cop and dying in the line of duty . How could I tell you what I did to mine ? Rita , I ... My father ... I lied . My father ... killed himself . The line of duty things was just to ... To cover up . I 'm sorry . What are we gonna do ? We can 't just run from all of this . You said Chad made it go away , right ? How did he do that ? Weren 't you questioned by the police ? The people he delt with , they arraigned some lawyer , some big shot attorney . He came with me for the questioning , and he just ... He just made it all go away . A defense attorney . You remember what his name is ? Sure . His name is Barry Coldburn . I got you one of the best attorneys in the state , Barry Coldburn . You are now protected under attorney-client privilege . Take a plea . I can probably get you murder II . I have to say , Tobey ... When you screw up , you swing for the fences . I can assure you tomorrow will go just as planned . How are you gonna pull that off ? Your two sheriffs , Fencik and Buchalter , got hit today . I can find replacements . Do you realize what this could cost us , all these messes I keep having to clean up ? It 's all under control . This all started when you couldn ' t keep it in your pants for that mexican girl . And now , I 'm trying to keep the whole system from imploding . By tomorrow , you 'll be back in control and we 'll be moving on to bigger and better things . Really ? Detweiler is dead . And who knows how much Hopper 's learned . Not enough to hurt us . Not yet . It 's hard enough paining Garza on Hopper . Now even that may not stick . I 'll make sure it sticks . How ? We still have our inside man . So , is that the sealed warrant ? No , I couldn 't get it . It 's locked in judge Nitzberg 's safe . What 's this ? I did get you this subpoena list though . Okay , I got it . Booth , Detweiler , Damien , Garza . Are these all tied to the same case ? I don 't understand . Why was Garza subpoenaed ? He cut a deal . He 's supposed to testify against Booth . Garza was dirty too . Spivak ? You know who he is ? Detective Brett Hopper ? We 've got the gun , with your prints on it . I think you killed Garza ... ... hit Shelten five times . She was quite a looker . Brett Hopper ? You 're under arrest for the murder ... Brett Hopper you 're under arrest for the murder of Alberto Garza . ... assistant D.A. Alberto Garza . The guy 's running after me since Day 1 .

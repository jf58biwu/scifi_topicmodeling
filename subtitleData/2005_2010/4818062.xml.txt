 Dan ! what were you doing ? I was thinking . What ? You ? Shut up ! That 's why I was in there ! But why were you in there ? Aren 't there better places for thinking ? Like libraries and stuff . That 's not why . Then why ? It 's gotta be a place where you 're all squished . Then you can squish the thoughts out ... Baching " ! Note : Think of it as SFX for a light bulb turning on in your head . ... And you get a thought . What were you thinking about ? I forgot . What ? ! What 's the use of that ? it doesn 't matter any more ! Dan ! Okay ! From here to ten buildings down ! Ten of them ! Let her rip ! Got it ! K. Incredible ! Dan ! With this you can pay off your debt and still have change left over ! What are you saying ? with this he could go to the Moon and heal Coco 's legs ! what 're you planning ? right ? Dunno yet . H-Hey ! What 's the deal ? ! Ordinary citizens playing streetball is illegal . We arrest on sight ! So where are we supposed to play ? How should I know ? Ask an official ! Bigfoot streetball is prohibited . What about this one ? B-F-B V-S St ... BFB vs. Street OCB Official Match . So what 's that ? Probably that . the " man with the limbs of God . James will write a new chapter in Bigfoot Basketball history ! and come to the city ! Open City Basketball ! OCB . Have high hopes . Dan ! Sorry for the wait ! huge ! how 'd you pay ? duh ! baddabing ! Pay up . So you 're treating . right ? OCB . Have high hopes . Like I know ! Dan ? ! But they look so good ! Legend ! What 's the meaning of this ? ! and you choose now to pull out ? ! James Lone ? ! this is tyranny ! Don 't think you can get away with it just because the Moon 's Executive Council sponsors you ! I am leaving it up to the players themselves to decide whether to join my league or not . But I must admit I 'm surprised at how many actually did ! Be serious ! Well ... T-This is ... Transfer fees for the players . I think this ends the discussion . A present for your sister ? How 'd you know — ? Is that what you think Coco desires ? what the hell was up with that guy ? with just your fingertips . Okay ! Excuse me ! It 'll only be a moment ! Jiiya ! Just stay still ! How will you make it up to me if Coco learns of my social status ? What are you saying ? you could make her immediately useful as your servant . why are you here in this barbaric town ? How awful it must be for you ! Jiiya . milady ! Coco ? Coco . Your brother brought you a present today . It 's a diamond ! A diamond . I can get plenty more ! And then even your legs would be easy ... Coco . I don 't want it . isn 't jewels or money . Dan ? Hell if I know . Do you intend to steal the open style away from us ? What an unpleasant way to put it . I 'm merely helping out . Helping out ? My compatriots on the Moon are striving and toiling to establish a new sports culture here on the ground . What would you do without help from the council ? How kind . uncut jewels you 've found and polish them into beautiful diamonds . You can return to the Moon with a clear conscience . What ? Your Bianca and Kate ... I see tiny hints of decline in their perfect circles . Mmm-hmm ! Earthside gravity is too heavy for you . Go home to the Moon . That ball-loving bastard ! water . Water ? You 've had too much . Aww ... We 've been backed into a corner . Looks that way . and Raymond ... Might as well call this team the BFB All-Stars ! Gonna get their autographs ? As if . There 's no doubt they 're gonna do their best to crush us street players . Why again ? So basically he planned from the start to form his league from hand-picked BFB players . we 're amateurs . We can 't win against pros . and the new pro team will take your jewels . { sz : Meaning the pro team will steal the shiney of the original players for themselves } It doesn 't matter if that was the plan . and so what if they 've come to crush us ... We 're gonna turn the tables and crush them . Come in ! This is the place ? The basketball bar ? Yep ! Pretty nice ! anyway . Good ! They like it . Oh ? So you street players drink in bars like this too ? What ? What 're you implying ? ! let me pick up the tab for all the street players here . You got it . What 's your angle ? that 's all ! ladies ... amateur ? Sounds good ! Mama ? Nothing we can do right now . Just watch for a chance and throw water on them or something . Truly dumb men . I guess they need a release . Slash ? I played a bit with the little legend . Legend ... Don 't tell me you — I didn 't do anything . I should hope you didn 't . We can 't afford to fail . Dan JD . I wonder if he 'll actually sign . He 'll sign . he will . giving up ? what are you doing ? You 'll get caught again ! It 's no skin off my nose . Coco ! How 're you doing ? Your brother brought you your favorite food . It 's your fault ! It 's because you couldn 't make the dunk that my legs ... It 's your fault ! They 're alive . Even though I 've been gone a year . Of course they are . Coco fed them every day after you got caught . She did ? Coco ... Coco ! Your brother 's got a good idea ! Look at this piggy bank ! I 'm gonna fill it up and use the money to fix your legs ! Coco ! You 'll play basketball agai — what happened to Dunk Mask ? Got me . but the room that was seized had its door just standing open . And it turned out Dan wasn 't there . I wonder if we still have to do maintenance on Dangan ? Dan jumped straight into a contract . right ? If it even amounts to tryouts . But he hasn 't given a reply about the contract yet ... Give me your answer during the second round of the tryouts . I 'll leave these with you . You can take your time thinking about it . right ? I guess even Dan couldn 't say no ! Destroy ! Another decision ! it 's a foul . Foul ! Iceman . has thrown the townspeople into an uproar ! Is this really a former BFB player ? Every team Iceman Hotty joined dropped him for throwing these same Destroy balls . The situation is bleak . seventh match . and the Ironbells ' Raymond Chris . Opposing these pros is street team : Allan Naismith ! the street team 's play has been wild and sloppy ! the referee 's whistle echoes ! Just not feelin ' it . They get called on a foul every time they even start to show off ! is " Open City Basketball " really the carved-in-stone official name ? right ? But what about Basquash ? The audience is starting to complain . As expected . but it 's an official thing with a court and rules . We have no need to grovel before low-class fans who want to think of it like that vulgar streetball . Slash ? No sport that has neglected to select and train its fans has ever thrived . nice one ! Go ! here ! Again ? Bel . Give me a hand . For what ? A festival ! Festival ? maybe ... Ow ! What are you here for ? nothing . I just figured it was about time . What 's that supposed to mean ? Haruka and the others seem to have something in mind already . Not interested . Sounds like something went " baching . in the end . A pass went through ! Go ! Iceman ! Over the line ! Out of bounds ... Unable to judge . What ? ! Why are you doing that ? We were lured by these . Swimsuit photos of the Platinum Hurricane Sela D. Miranda in the flesh ! everyone ! Yeah ! You 've gotta be kidding ! Not gonna happen ! Destroy ! then I 'm gonna do this in your precious street style too ! this time Falcon is attacking Iceman ! What will happen to this match ? Iceman ! you there in the pink ! Raise your hand ! O-Okay ! We 're substituting ! but I 'm taking over the showdown you got going here . H-Hey ... That 's ... 106.2 ) } WITHIN 718.2 ) } OUT OF Dumbass ! Court ? Rules ? Referee ? Nothing about this basketball is " open " or " city " ! Iceman ! Sela ! Watch . This is Basquash ! Like this !

You won 't need to — sir ? by the way . Foul . Foul . Shut up ! not to mention the street players ! Is the OCB no more than a Moonsider 's pipe dream ? Miyuki ! Bring me that ball ! yeah ! The ball 's all ready for you ! Thank you ! but a sport . And I 'm saying you don 't understand that sport ! Officials like that can eat shit ! I 'll shit if you want ! That 's it ! little lines can eat shit ! We don 't have bounds ! Dunk Mask ! Shatter those lines ! Sweet ! Kepple ! Ma 'am ! This is my answer ! The court ... disappeared ? Diamonds ! It 's raining diamonds ! you bubble-blowing bastard ? I confirm that I 've received your answer ! Dunk Mask is banned for life ! Dumbass ! It 's no hardship to be banned from a group I never joined ! that 's right . I forgot one . Here ! Retreat ! Okay ! I don 't acknowledge your basketball ! { alt tl : I 'll never agree that your [ version of this thing called ] basketball has worth ! } Nor the balls you throw ! you ... Let go ! It 's just getting good ! Basquash ! Hey ! This one 's empty ! they vanished from the town .

We 're getting requests for matches from people all over the world who saw the live feed just now ! where ?

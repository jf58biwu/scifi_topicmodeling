 Olivia Dunham . FBI . They 're calling these events the pattern . As if someone out there is experimenting ... only the whole world is their lab . Anybody you need you can have . His name 's Walter Bishop . - My father . He worked out of Harvard . He was part of a classified US army experimental program In an area called fringe science . You 're telling me my father was Dr. Frankenstein . So much happened here , and so much is about to . Captain Loeb , what 's your 20 ? We 're in tow . 200 meters out . What 's your ETA [ Estimated Time of Arrival ] ? We 're in position . Standing by . No activity captain . Roger . Hold position . Charlie ? In position . Standing by . Delta ? Standing by captain . Roger . Cutting engines . At south bank now . South bank quiet . Bravo , status . All quiet sir . Wait . I think I hear something . We have tango in sight . All teams move out . Go go go . Stop the truck . Stay where you are . Out . Out . Get out . Hands where I can see them . Packed bears ? I assume you checked inside of them . They knew we were coming . Somewhere they made a switch . Joseph Smith . Began working for the shipping company ... a week before the container was packed . He had access to the container . He 's also got a science background . Customs has him back and forth ... from Budapest eight times in the past 12 months . Other local agents on the operation ? Coscarelli and Scrimm . Page 47 . Weight of the container after pickup was 1306 pounds . The weight when it arrived in Germany ... before shipping , 1299 . That 's seven pounds . What the hell weighs seven pounds ? Mitchel ? Let 's get a medic in here . What 'd you give him ? One round of Eppy . Intermittent cardiac arrest . I 've never seen anything like this . Pupils fixed one minute dilating the next . How 's the rhythm now ? - Asystole . Charge the paddles. we 'll start at 200 . Phillip . Phillip what 's happening ? We don 't know . - Is he gonna be okay ? Is it a heart attack ? The only thing for us to do ... is wait . Clear . All right . Again , let 's go to 300 . V. fib . - Clear . We gotta open him up pump the heart manually . Prep him . Scalpel . Saw . Retractor . We got something . His heart 's beating . What is that ? I don 't know . It happened in my office two hours ago . It wasn 't a heart attack . At least not in the traditional sense . They cordoned off the area . But ID 's been here already . Said the thing isn 't communicable . The thing ? We 'll get to that . You have any gum ? - No Walter . Mints ? - No . Later . Agent Loeb returned ... from an operation last week in Frankfurt . Do you know him at all ? - No . He collapsed . Thought it was a seizure at first ... except he appeared lucid in pain . Didn 't seem like a heart attack either . None of us know what it was . None of us know now either . How are his vital signs ? - Weakening . Dr. Bishop . What you 're about to see ... I don 't know if you 've seen anything like it before . But I 'm hoping you have . I 'm hoping you can help . The man lying in that room is not just a colleague . He 's a friend . I see . Do you have any mints ? This is spectacular . 'Spectacular . ' I 'm sure he 'd be thrilled to hear your diagnosis . Do you know what that is ? Your work or your old experiments ... Does that look ... - Look familiar ? No . Couldn 't be more aberrational . I 'm simply admiring the design . At least partially organic . Looks like the hybrid result of genetic manipulation . Symmetrical its central body mass . If indeed it is an organism at all It 's designed it seems ... to envelope the entire human heart . Look , look . A series of tendrils . A root system . Don 't you see it ? How beautiful this is ? Not so much , no . Can you help ? Do you think you can remove it ? Oh , I 'd be willing to try . But not here . My breath is atrocious . I was deconstructing in my head ... the approach to designing something like this . And ... and two things occurred to me ... on the journey from the hospital . One ... we could be dealing with something as simple ... as uh , giardia duodenalis . As simple as that . Really ? It 's a single-celled parasite ... that lives in the intestines of animals . Common waterborne illness . Could we attach mister ... Loeb . - Loeb To the vitals machine please ? So you 're saying that ... that thing in his chest ... Is a parasite ? Yes . Yes , perhaps . But with an exceptional means of attachment . Typically , parasites use whole body insertion . This creature is unlike anything I 've ever seen before . So we won 't be able to truly examine it ... until it 's removed . Mitchel Loeb 's recent case files as requested . Oh , thanks Astrid . And his wife just arrived . She asked to speak with you . I 'm gonna talk to her in the office . Okay , he 's wired . What was the other thing ? Pardon ? You said that two things occurred to you . What 's the other one ? I would still really like some gum . Or some mints ? Thank you peter . Mrs. loeb . Olivia dunham . I 'm with homeland security . Samantha . I 'm hoping you can help me . No one will tell me anything . Why was he transferred here ? can you at least tell me that ? I can tell you that there 's a doctor here Who is ... Uniquely qualified To save your husband 's life . This was in his bag . Among the things he brought home from frankfurt . I don 't know if it 'll help at all . It might . We 'll check it out. thank you . Can I see mitchel ? please . As soon as possible . I promise you that . Uh-oh. what 's happening ? It 's killing him . It 's squeezing his heart. it 's killing him . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna give him some cyclobenzaprine . If the parasite is constricting This might loosen its grip . It 's a gamble but I like the theory . Look at this . This is good . Organism 's tissue . Where the hell are you going ? DNA analysis should tell us much . Excellent work son . You may have found your true calling at last . Working with me . I certainly hope not . Please tell me you guys have some good news . I don 't know if it 's good news but it is something . This is fascinating . What ? We can assume that this growth This parasite is ... is of human design yes ? Okay . I was looking for repetition . The signature of the creator . A sign a ... a footprint That he or she had been there before us . I don 't understand . Well that puts you in the same group As the rest of humanity . What he 's trying to say is we found this . Ah. no see that ? This pattern repeats throughout the DNA sequence . It appears again and again . But it 's too organized to be accidental . Too perfect to be natural . So you 're saying That someone put in this line of dna on purpose . Why ? Mischief. arrogance. we don 't know . Your friend thinks it might be a code . The other one . I studied cryptology even before I joined the bureau . I was obsessed as a kid . Now I keep assuming it can 't be this . That it 's too simple to be plain text . But I think it may just be the caesar shift . What 's that ? It 's a simple monoalphabetic cipher . Is it now ? It 's what julius caesar used apparently To send letters to his friends . You take one letter and replace it with another But in alphabetical order . There 's a sequence of three letters That appears repeatedly In the parasite 's dna . It could be c-i-w or d-j-x Or e-k-y . Or z-f-t . Yeah z-f-t fits. what is that ? I 've been reviewing john scott 's cases Checking to see if any of them were mishandled Or seeing if any of the cases were left unsolved . And ? and one of them that I remember Was an operation tracking a group working out of budapest . The name on the file What was written was ' Z-F-T' That mean something to you ? what ? A month ago a man ... British national named david robert jones Was arrested in frankfurt germany by interpol On possession of state secrets . His background is in deep bio-technology . Notably genetic weaponry . He was a senior fellow at the bremming institute For 12 years then went off the grid . He 'd show up now and then often in eastern europe . So you think he 's z.f.t. I don 't know. but loeb did . It was one of the reasons he was in frankfurt Investigating jones . Meaning that thing ... May be retribution . So z.f.t. what is it ? who are they ? Agent dunham there is much you have not been made aware of Regarding the pattern . Well I 'm here . I have time . Are you available ? What we 've learned so far is that There are cells . We don 't know how many . Privately funded with presence in 83 recorded countries . Z.f.t. is among them . So they 're terrorists . Not in a conventional sense . They traffic not in drugs or weapons But in scientific progress . Meaning what ? Meaning what happened on flight 627 Or what happened to agent loeb . These may have been simply proof That a scientific theory An experiment worked . So that thing we found in loeb Could be one of those experiments . Do you think jones will tell us how to remove it ? He might if we were allowed to see him . German authorities have refused us access . What ? They 're not giving the u.s. access . And he 's being kept in frankfurt . Yeah . I may be able to get in . You got super powers you aren 't telling me about ? Maybe . You 're not really going to germany . Yeah I 'm really going . Let me save you the trip dunham . You 're not getting in . We don 't know each other well enough For you to say something like that to me . And I don 't see any other option here . Do you sir ? Loeb 's your friend . And I promised his wife . What 's wrong ? This may be something of an understatement But he is not doing well . Dehydrated . Walter come here . What is that ? That 's the root . Coming up from his arm ? Into the iv yes . This parasite is spreading faster than I thought . How long do you think he 's got ? A day maybe . Hey . Hi. so the good news is I think we have a lead . The bad news is I have to go to germany to see him . I don 't think that 's the bad news . He 's dying Olivia . I don 't think we 're gonna make it . We 're gonna make it . I 'll call you when I land . Look at you . Well don 't let the suit throw you . Wow lucas I never thought I 'd see the day . It 's more comfortable than the military uniform . Hi . Hi ... sorry . I 'm not sure I can help you . You said you have contacts at the prison . I 'm in the bundestag . I have contacts everywhere . But you jumped on a plane so fast I didn 't have time to check anything out . Well what did you find ? I know the warden . He wouldn 't agree to anything . He didn 't want me to show up . So what do we do ? Show up . Tenacious as always . What can I do for you lucas ? Olivia dunham this is Johan Lennox . Thank you for seeing us . You want time with a prisoner ? David robert jones . This will be a problem . I 'm sure we can work something out . I 'm sorry . Your friend wants to be persuasive . Mr. lennox you have your reasons Why you won 't allow access to your prisoners But this is very important to me . I would be willing to sign anything . I like her . You have good taste . Even if I were to give the okay Mr. jones talks to no one . I have reason to believe he will talk to me . If I write him a message will you give it to him ? I don 't expect miracles . I don 't know if I expect anything . But I am grateful for whatever you can do in this case . Sorry ? I was just saying I 'm grateful for your work . You 're most welcome . You know I had a fruit cocktail once In atlantic city . Mind you I 'm not the fruit cocktail Sort of guy . Excuse me . We need to discuss your father . Is it the fruit cocktail thing again ? Yeah he 's been doing that recently . He gets obsessed about certain foods . It 's weird . We need him to focus . To focus ? Mr. broyles Two-thirds of the time My father 's not even lucid . And in those rare And unpredictable moments of clarity He rambles on about the foods and beverages that he missed While he was incarcerated in a mental institution For the better part of the last two decades . To say that he 's not focused Is to say that he 's a biped Which is to say you 're absolutely right . He 's not focused . And also it 's not going to change any time too soon . I 'm his son . I 'm not a puppeteer . I don 't have a remote control . There 's no master switch I can flick And turn him into the man I wish had raised me Or even somebody I don 't have to baby-sit every day . I guess I 've had that on my mind for awhile . Apparently . Broyles . It 's charlie francis . I understand I 'm not at clearance level But I have something for you . What is it ? Local connecontion to the z.f.t. Speak to me . We analyzed the document loeb brought back from frankfurt . We figured out each line corresponds to an fbi case file And an i.d. number for the agent or agents Assigned to it . Every one of them originating from this field office . Another mole in this office ? And you think what ? John scott ? he was working with z.f.t. ? Maybe. maybe not . Whoever did this needed upper level security clearance . Access to the fbi mainframe . You said local connection . Yeah one of the lines is a phone number Registered to a joseph smith and we have him tied ... Yeah I know joseph smith . Loeb was briefing me on him when he collapsed . You got an address ? Hold on . 4331 broad street saugus . 4331 broad street . I 'll call you back . This is broyles . I want a swat team surrounding joseph smith . He 's at 4331 broad street in saugus . And I want this radio silent . It 's good to see you again . Despite the strange circumstance . You don 't have to wait with me . As you keep telling me . I want to . I really like it here . Thank you . I 'm surprised . He 'll see you . But not until tomorrow morning . This is not jones ' rule or mine . This is the institution 's . Long before I got here There have been strict regulations regarding visitors . Tomorrow morning you 'll have 14 minutes . Not a second more . Mr. jones wanted you to have this . Hello . Peter it 's me . I 'm looking for broyles. is he there ? No he 's on some sort of raid . Jones has agreed to meet with me tomorrow morning . But only on the condition he talks to some guy first . So we 're looking for a guy local to boston . He 's in saugus . He 's in what ? His name 's joseph smith . At 4331 broad street . How 'd you know that ? That 's who broyles is after right now . What ? How ? - I-I don 't know . Peter we need him alive . Are you there ? No . I 'm on my way . You get in touch with broyles yet ? No they 're still radio silent . I 'm gonna call hq . I 'll call you right back . I know they 're radio silent But you 've got to get someone down there right now . Please you need to get the message to them . They need to keep joseph smith alive . Damn it . You must stand back sir . I 've got information . To phillip broyles. you need to get back . You are not authorized to get any closer to the house . Are you close ? Yeah I 'm here But I can 't get any closer to the house . They 're already inside . On the roof. on the roof . Oh no . What ? Peter . Freeze . FBI . Stop or we 'll shoot . Drop your weapon . No no no no . Peter . Peter . Have the evidence response team ... catalog and box every item down to the toilet paper . Bishop What are you doing here ? Well I just got off the phone with olivia . She 's headed back to the airport . Turns out Mr. Jones would only help us If he could talk to Mr. Smith . The same Mr. Smith that your people just killed . You 're kidding me . That 's the first serious thing I 've said all day . Hello . Peter. hey it 's Astrid . That there is fluid accumulating in agent Loeb 's lungs . Tell him we need help quickly . He says we need help quickly . Insert this into his iv . Let me talk to him . Uh hello Peter. this is me your father . Walter Bishop . Thank you Walter . I know who you are . Excellent . Uh we need to talk to that man Smith right away . He may be our best chance To save Agent Loeb 's life . I know that but he 's dead . He was shot. we 're out of luck . Well does he still have his head ? Is it still attached to his body ? Only you would ask that question seriously . Yes he still has a head . Splendid . Then perhaps in this case Death is simply an inconvenience . Bring him in and hurry . Agent Loeb 's tissue is already deteriorating Which makes it exponentially messier . What ? So close . You never did lose well . What happened olivia ? There is something that has ... Shifted in you . Something 's happened . Well a lot has happened . It 's been a strange time . I wasn 't gonna say these words . But here we are so I 'm gonna say them . I 've become ... and I am not kidding ... A spectacular cook . Spend the night . I can 't Lucas . Of course you can . Of course you can . Dunham . Does Jones know about Smith ? What Does David Jones know that Joseph Smith is dead ? No. why ? 'cause if you can still get in to see him tomorrow He may not have to . Oh good. uh bring him down here so quickly . Get me ice. you already asked . And the halo head brace . it 's right over there . We got it from here. thanks . Uh did I ask ... To put salt water in the trough. yes . 90 kilograms. not a drop more . He 's been shot in the head . Is that a problem ? Yes that 's a problem . Of course it 's a problem . A bullet in the head would normally indicate Significant brain trauma . Well it would also indicate that he 's dead . But you didn 't seem to have a problem with that . This procedure is not like removing tonsils . I 've never had a conversation with a dead guy before . Forgive me if I don 't know the rules . Is this going to work or not ? I 'll need to alter the procedure . And I 'm not making any promises . 86 degrees dr. bishop . Good. almost there . Let me know when it 's exactly 84.5. blue . The human braiis like a computer. green . Just needs electricity to function Which the body ceases to produce upon death . Which is why we 're keeping His body cold to retard degeneration . It 's astonishing how this man 's scalp resembles ... Peter 's bare bottom when he was a baby . How did you know that ? You told us that already. twice . What did I say next ? That we 're gonna kick-start his brain . Ah yes . Excellent . Conductive gel to prevent the electrical current From setting him on fire . Spread it evenly . And don 't forget his nipples . Oh peter . In ' 75 the fbi asked me to use this procedure . Someone had been murdered . But I don 't recall his name . Hmm . James I believe . James. jamie . Jimmy . They want me to identify his assessee . Union leader I think . Jimmy Hoffa ? Yes . Well the ... the trouble was He had a shockingly low electro-sensitivity . When I turned on the machine It instantly fried his brain like an egg . Everyone has a unique tolerance to electrical stimulation . Mine for instance is remarkably high . Yours peter unusually low . As for our friend here we don 't know . Too little current and it won 't work . Too much and we will overcook his brain . So I will have ... You used to do this to me . You attached wires to car batteries And then you would shock me . Yes I was accumulating data . No you were experimenting on me . Son we 're ready . First we must test if this ... will register any brain activity . And this will indicate If he 's transmitting any thoughts to you . Since he 's dead peter You 'll obviously have to be his ears and mouth . Eventually we 'll connect this to your head . Okay dear we 're ready. turn it on . Try 200 microvolts . Oh look peter . He 's talking to you . I suppose it 's a good thing it wasn 't attached to your head . Not kidding. looked into it . You have not . I have . So ... mm ? Who was he ? Whoever it was who broke your heart . Or am I misreading you ? He was my partner from the bureau . And you of all people should know That I 've always been a little inept at this . But he was straight forward decisive Charming and it was wonderful . Except it was all a lie and he betrayed me . Betrayed the job . Then he died . That 's the end . That 's the end for him . I 've known this for years . I screwed up With you . The timing wasn 't right for either of us . Yes it was . I know it was . But I was scared . And that 's the ... that 's the god 's honest truth . I think about you ... So often and ... I don 't call because ... Because I 'm ashamed of how I treated you . No it was just ... Lucas i ... I ... i have to ... I have ... I have to get this . I hate whoever that is . Hello . Hey. you 're not gonna believe this ... 'cause I 'm not really sure that I do . But I think this might actually work . Walter figured it out ? Well there are limits . some issues and problems . But walter seems to think we can get the dead guy To answer some questions . Then we 're on . I 'll call you from the prison . 8 : 00 a.m. tomorrow my time . You okay ? I 'm good. thank you . I 'm gonna go back to the hotel . Grateful to you To the incredible cooking And your sweet words . Do you hear anything ? I think we gotta ask him a question first . I see . Are we ready to see how this is working ? When I say go You astro ask peter a question . I will flip the switch which will stimulate Our naked friend 's brain . And peter you will hear his response . Any questions ? Uh yeah. what should I ask him ? Anything you like. it 's only a dry run . And son I should apologize in advance . I 'm afraid this ... Well I shouldn 't frighten you . No. wouldn 't want to do that . 3 2 1 . Go . What 's your favorite flavor of ice cream ? Anything ? Did I hear anything ? no . 3 2 1. go . What 's your favorite color ? Nope. still nothing. just extreme discomfort . Hello . They 're taking me to see jones now . It 's olivia. they 're taking her in . No. we 're not ready yet . No no no. tell her she has to stall . Did you hear that ? I 'll do what I can But I 've only got 14 minutes starting now . 14 minutes . What a pleasure this is . We have your mr. smith in custody . You will not speak with him directly . You will ask me one question that you want answered . I will relay that question to an agent back in the states Who will talk to mr. smith . I will then relay mr . smith 's response to you . Then you will tell me how to save agent loeb . That is how it works . You 're very serious do you know that ? Your friend 's life hangs in the balance Is that it ? And you want me to save him . I gathered as much from your note . Tell me something . Why not your freedom Or extradition ? You must realize that you have leverage here . Yet all you want is the answer to one question ? You make two assumptions ms. dunham Both incorrect . The first is that there is nothing more valuable Than my freedom . The second is that I am responsible For the infection of agent loeb . Hello gene . Shh. not a word . I think I know your problem . You think too much . It 's a family curse . Your own brain function is interfering With the process . You need to be a passive receiver . This is a sedative . It will numb your higher brain function . I 've mixed it with a euphoria inhibitor Which will clear the high from your system In a matter of minutes . If I tell you to stick this in his chest right here . Beneath the breast bone . what is that ? Adrenaline. why walter ? Are you planning on stopping my heart ? Walter what are you giving me ? Nothing for you to worry about . Perfectly harmless . What is going on in here ? Mitchel . If you 're not responsible For infecting agent loeb who is ? Perhaps the same people responsible For bringing us together . What if someone wanted information From the both of us ? Do you see ? Perhaps they 've orchestrated all of this . What if you and i ... Both of us at this very moment Were being manipulated ? By whom ? And what would they want ? You 've not been doing this very long have you ? There are very few things in life That surprise me anymore ms. dunham . And yet I confess I am confused . If it is so urgent to save The life of your friend Why haven 't we gotten on with it ? Peter . Peter can you hear me ? This can 't possibly be scientific . Peter look at me . Daddy ? Hmm . I think we 're ready . Hello. go. quick . Go ahead. ask your question . Ask my friend joe ... Where does the gentleman live ? Mr. jones would like to know Where does the gentleman live ? Three . Mitchel. oh god . What is it ? parasite in his bloodstream choking him of oxygen . Asteroid nitroglycerine in a vial on the desk . Wait a minute . I don 't understand. a parasite ? Could you give us some room please ? I 'll call you back . Come on sam let them do their job . Is there a problem ? My phone doesn 't get the best reception In prison isolation cells . You do have mr. smith do you not ? I 'm curious . Why do you think he would cooperate with you After you had him arrested ? Oh the people I work with Are loyal to the end . Can you say the same ? Hello . Okay we 're trying again . Three , two , one. go . Where does the gentleman live ? Do you hear anything ? No. no . I 'm going to have to increase the voltage . I 'm sorry son . Three , two , one. go . Where does the gentleman live ? Uh-uh. nothing . No . Astrid I need the answer now . Agent dunham it 's not working . I need paper . Paper. give me some paper . Quick quick . I see something . Wait. hold on . Untie my hand . Quickly . What is that ? I have no idea . I need the answer now . We don 't have it yet . I don 't think it 's working . Walter what is this ? How do I know ? You saw it not me . He seems rather irritated with you . Astrid please . I have no time . I know. you have to hold on . I 'm sorry . Walter what is it ? do you see it ? It 's there . There 's just something missing . Obviously horizontal lines . There 's literature on this . Misrepresentation of horizontal space In unilateral brain damage . Astrid please hurry . I-i don 't understand . It 's just a conjecture . But the bullet may have destroyed That part of the brain That ... that helps process horizontal lines . We are going to have to fill in the blanks . God astrid I have no time . I need the answer now astrid. please . Little hill. little hill ? Little hill . Three parts mebendazole . Two parts thermophilic hydrolase . A syringe directly into the parasite . Astrid write this down . Three parts mebendazole . Two parts thermophilic hydrolase . A syringe directly into the parasite . Walter. look . The roots. they 're dying . Well does that mean that ... Is ... is mitchel gonna live ? Is ... is he gonna be okay ? Yes my dear . I believe he will . Thank you. doctor bishop . Jones asked me a question About loyalty . And something about the way he said it It felt like he knew something . Like what ? Something about my partner betraying the bureau . I don 't know . You know I have other means Of gathering information about mr. jones . If you 'd like me to use them . Say yes olivia . It 'll give me an excuse to call you again . Mitchel I understand that you 're feeling Far from 100 % . But while you were unconscious We made a discovery . That an organization with connections to the pattern May have someone working for us on the inside . John scott . That was our first thought . But he would have needed to have higher clearance Than scott was afforded . We thought that perhaps you were talking to him Because you might have discovered who that person was . Scott 's the only one I know of . You 're making me paranoid . All I want to do is make you better . I 'll see you in the morning . All right . Please seeing you . Sir . How is he ? He 's good . The doctor here removed that thing From his chest . Walter made sure he saved it for him . I bet he did . But what about answers ? The question jones asked smith . And the response he got ' little hill ' ? We know that agent loeb was infected But we don 't know by whom . Jones says it wasn 't him . We don 't know anything . You have a problem agent nham . You 're not easily satisfied . You want everything and you want it now . In your mind somehow a small victory is no victory . What you did was save a man 's life But that doesn 't land for you . Sir ... I would tell you to snap the hell out of it . To stop whining about what you can 't know Can 't control can 't change . I would tell you to get some sleep while you can Because tomorrow we 'll do this all over again And guess what You 'll have a million new answers And a million and one new questions . I would tell you those things but I won 't Because your dissatisfaction Is what makes you so damn good . Someone I 'm proud to say I work with . Thank you . Now go get some sleep while you can . Hey how you feeling ? I should be asking you that . Good job. thank you . You too . You hungry ? After everything I saw today No not at all . But I am thirsty . Really really thirsty . Me too . Look at that . Yeah look at that . They 're gone . So did it work what we did ? Yes. it led them back to Mr. jones . Did he ask the question ? And did we get the answer ? Little hill .

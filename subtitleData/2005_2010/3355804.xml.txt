Someone who wants to work with you . Why ? Because you 're a killer . For some reason , you 're important to him . I don 't ask questions like that . Now come on . I 'm not a killer anymore . And you 're not going anywhere . Look , I 'm on your side ! Can 't you see They 're trying to change you in here , Make you into something that you 're not ? You don 't know anything about me !

When I saw you in the future , you ... You changed . You found a way to suppress it . How ? I don 't know . But just knowing that I figure it out , Just believing it 's a possibility , gives me hope . I don 't want hope . I want it gone . This is not about you and me . I woke you because your mother 's in trouble ... Our mother . Hello ? Hello , Mr. African Issac She said she knew him . Maybe we just ought to give her a little more time .

 - Let 's try it again . Who is this ? - It 's me . Of course it 's me . Of course , Emon . Of course . And who is this ? I don 't know . You know who she is . I don 't have to tell you . Indeed . And what is she telling you ? I don 't remember . Damn your machine ! You don 't remember . Smells trigger memories , Emon . I can smell Aeon now . Leather . Hazelnuts . Gun powder . Sex . Memories are precious . We are only what we remember of ourselves and what we have done . Without memories , we are nothing . So tell me , Emon . What do you remember now ? What did Aeon tell you ? What plots ? What plans ? What plunderings ? - She hates you . - What ? She told me that she hated you ! Your memory 's playing tricks . And so am I. To retrieve the rest of these images , please obtain a narghile ... and bring it to the location described on the rear side of this photograph . Who wanted the narghile ? Who is your contact ? - What 's a narghile ? - Don 't play dumb with me , you bitch . You know that narghiles are a controlled species . Ugly . Nasty . - Dangerous . - I think it 's sweet . Sweet ? You 're the sweet one . Hedrik , I don 't want to see you doing that . Allow me . Now key her up and throw away the lock . Yes , sir . - Not now . I can 't stand backseat drivers . - Better buckle up . Emon ! This isn 't the time to bear a grudge . I haven 't the time , but I 'll get you out of here . - Let 's go . Now . - I don 't know you . - Who are you ? - Emon , don 't say that . I may have dumped you , but I wouldn 't desert you . Ripe fruit for picking ! Feel my skin ! Feel my skin ! Feel my skin ! I don 't care who you are or what you 're up to . But you 're in my way , so just let me pass . Keep away from me . I 'm desperate . Desperate to live or to die ? Your choice . I would have let you go , you idiot ! I would have . Hell . No ! Impressive . You 're not going to hurt me , are you ? Why would I be interested in hurting you ? I don 't know . You look as though you might . You look as though you might enjoy it . - Really ? Appearances can be deceptive . - No kidding . - So why did Muriel stand me up ? - Who 's Muriel ? Wait a minute . - Muriel didn 't send you ? - No . But you came from the prison , right ? - Yes . - Did you see a woman ? Short hair , very pale . Would have been wearing a gray prison uniform . I wish I could say I hadn 't seen her . I 'm sorry . You don 't want to know what happened . She didn 't make it , did she ? I told her not to trust them . She said it was her only chance . So odd . She didn 't trust anyone . Muriel . Did you know her ? I 'm sorry . Of course not . I 'm glad to know you . Thanks for taking me with you . - Where are you going now ? - I don 't know . Your place ? - This really isn 't the time . - Well , wake me up when it is . Good going , Muriel . Clean break . Sentence suspended for good behaviour . - You caught that ? - Not right now . - I 'm busy . - Excuse me . I 'm sorry , Aeon . I guess I 'm a little tense . It 's called a narghile . I collect them . You collect ... Could have met you earlier . Do you have the bliss pellets ? If your idea of bliss is to forget everything about yourself . Your favourite colour , your mother , your lover . I 'm truly sorry about Muriel . Yeah , well , she 'd want me to carry on . We took the bliss pellet together and found out how it really worked . It destroyed everything we had . - It twisted your minds ? - All our memories were gone . Had we been lovers ? Enemies ? What ? How had we met ? I didn 't even remember her name . Hell , I still don 't know how I lost my leg . - So why do you collect them ? - Planned extinction . Muriel and I made a promise to eliminate all of them . When we started , they were said to be endangered . Collect them all ? Seemed like no problem . It 's taken me years , Aeon . I 've caught thousands . Recorded every one . Now it 's down to a dribble . Almost finished . I fished them out ... Muriel climbed up the cable to store them on the platform . And once I 'd found them all ... Muriel would have blasted the platform off into the sun . You little bastard ! What have you done to my Muriel ? What has it done to you ? Is getting rid of them really so hard ? First thing you do is stop thinking about them . I thought you said you wouldn 't hurt me . - I didn 't . - So why am I so damn sore ? See the retro boosters ? I 'm not seeing it . There . Muriel took each of the narghiles up there . That was her idea ? Not to destroy them ? How ? You can 't kill them . So I was collecting them to blast into the sun . - The sun ? - Now I don 't know what I 'll do . - Sounds good . I 'll do it . - What ? I 'll take Muriel 's place . That 's what you want , isn 't it ? Well , I don 't know . I 'm not sure it 's a good idea . The air is very thin up there . You 'd have to wear a special suit . It 's dangerous . Come on . What else are you going to do ? You can 't climb up there yourself . Hey ! You think I 'm some kind of a helpless cripple ? Something like that . Muriel ! What is it , Muriel ? Are you angry that I hit you ? You know I couldn 't help it . Tell me you forgive me . You 're forgiven . That 's better . Muriel , I 've loved these close encounters . I can tell . This is the last ... narghile , you know . I won 't be putting it back . I figured . What ... should I tell Rorty ? Tell him to blast the platform . He 'll never know . What about us ? Oh , God ! I ... - It 's ... - You , too ? It 's over . Aeon ! How many of us can you betray at once , Trevor ? Who 's betraying who , Aeon ? What have you done to Muriel ? What have you done to Rorty ? Oh , Muriel . Why me ? Mission accomplished . That platform 's infested like a Breen tenement . So you didn 't have any trouble ? Everything okay ? Very much okay . I 'd say it 's time to rev up those boosters . Funny you should say that . It 's true . I 've found no more narghiles . It seems to be time . But how would you know that ? Looking for these ? - May I tell you the truth ? - That 's up to you . I never wanted to hurt you , Rorty . - Quite the opposite . - You expect me to believe that ? I have to hurt you . - I killed Muriel . - What ! I was in prison to retrieve those pictures . It was an accident . She attacked me . I fought back . When I met you outside , I thought I 'd try to make it right for you . - I didn 't expect to care about you . - You don 't care about me . - Muriel loved me . - Maybe she did . But the platform is empty , Rorty . - There are no narghiles there . - What are you talking about ? You 're lying again . - Muriel gave the narghiles to Trevor . - That 's ridiculous . Rorty , I know you won 't ... Trevor and Muriel wanted it as a reason to be together . - They were lovers . - No ! You 're the one sweating with Trevor . Get out . Get out ! - You 're trying to destroy me ! - Rorty ! Don 't ! I can prove it ! I need you to believe me . Go ahead . Prove it to your heart 's content . I don 't care ! Just get out ! Emon ! Rorty ! You believed me . Old faithful . Aeon , you 're slipping . Rorty . Look , Rorty . - It 's all right . I 'm here . - Muriel ? - Aeon ! - Look , Rorty . Look at the mark . It 's the one Muriel gave Trevor . - It doesn 't mean anything . - It means I 'm telling the truth . Sure . Fine . I really don 't care any more . Forget about it . I 've just gone halfway around the world to prove something to you ... and you don 't even care ? I think I 'm going to kill you . That 's what I expected the first time I laid eyes on you . Big mistake . - Here . Keep this as a memento of me . - I 'll never forget you , Aeon . Rorty . Rorty ? Where are you ? Rorty , I 'm sorry . I know how much ... - What are you doing here ? - I 'm not gonna hurt you again , Rorty . That 's nice . What 's your name ? No , Rorty . You didn 't . Didn 't what ? Who are you ? What is this place ? We are not what we remember of ourselves . We can undo only what others have already forgotten . Learn from your mistakes ... so that one day you can repeat them precisely . Stop . Erase .

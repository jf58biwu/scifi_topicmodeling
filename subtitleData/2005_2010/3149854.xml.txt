 ( Mohinder suresh ) the sun rises on a new dawn . Yet few of us realize the debt we owe To those responsible for this . To those who dwell among us , Anonymous , seemingly ordinary , Whom destiny brought together to repair , to heal , To save us from ourselves . If evolution can do this for even the smallest of creatures , Then why not these human beings ? If someone here ... found out about me , what would happen ? When will they stop ? I don 't know . ( Sylar ) she 's a shiny new toy , And she 's all mine . ( Suresh ) and they 're still out there , among us , In the shadows , in the light . We pass them on the street without a glance , Never suspecting , never knowing . Do they even know yet ? That they are bound together by a common purpose , A glaring reality , to be extraordinary ? Teleportation , tissue generation ; These are no longer simply theories . I have seen them with my own eyes . And when destiny does anoint them ... My name is hiro nakamura . I 'm from the future . How do they hide from it ? You may feel confined here , But this is far freer a cage than the one they 'd put you in . ( Mohinder ) how long can they dwell in the shadows Before either fate or their own flawed humanity Draws them out into the light again ? And how will they know what awaits them When it finally does ? And not only are these special individuals among us , They bear a curse . A virus which strips them of their powers And leads to their eventual death . In the last few months , I have discovered what i believe to be a plague . A plague which targets only these unique individuals . It 's a disease which threatens to eradicate them all . And in doing so , Deprives our species of its evolutionary advancement . Without this advancement , The challenges of the modern world : Global warming , terrorism , diminishing resources , Seem almost insurmountable on our thin shoulders . The fate of humanity itself hangs in the balance . But with proper funding and research , We can stop the advancement of this disease . I urge each and every one of you To take up this cause , spread the word , And fight those who would keep the world from the truth . Thank you all for coming . [ Scattered applause ] Inspirational lecture , dr . Suresh . I was wondering if i could trouble you For an autograph . Your father would 've been so proud . So would your sister . Who the hell are you and why are you following me ? This isn 't necessary . I 'm nobody . What , you think i didn 't recognize you ? You 've been at three of my lectures . Yeah . The company sent you to bag and tag me ? Is that it ? A year ago , i would 've run , but not anymore ! Well , that 's good , because if you had , I wouldn 't be able to offer you a job . I 've been down that road before . It doesn 't end well . Where will you go , dr . Suresh ? No one even believes they exist . I found your father 's book in the parapsychology section In-Between hypnosis and alien abductions . They don 't take you seriously . They all think you 're nuts . But not me . So if you 're really interested in saving the world , The least you can do is let me buy you a drink . [ Labored breathing ] [ Speaking spanish ] Ugh !

Just remember what we talked about . I know . I 'm claire butler . I won 't slip up . It 's not just the name . It 's everything . Trust me . The company is still out there . And they will find us unless we 're flawless With our plan . From now on ... You have to be entirely un-Extraordinary . Right . Don 't stand out in any way . Exactly . Don 't raise your hand in class . And don 't even think about trying out for cheerleading . Oh , come on , dad . That 's all behind me . Just blend in . Be ordinary , right ? You got it . You know , we might want to start By you not driving me to school . It kind of draws attention to me . Ouch . And , you know ... Don 't you think it might be easier on all of us if ... I had my own car ? Your mother and i were going to surprise you On your birthday next month . But ... Oh , my gosh . The rogue ? Thank you , daddy ! Oh ! It 's yours . You 're the best dad in the world . [ School bell rings ] I know . I know . Claire . It 's just ...

I 've been , uh , i 've wanted to be a cop my whole life . Four bullets to the chest aren 't gonna change that . Well , we were gonna drag this out , Make you sweat .

Well , let me break it down for you . Are you a robot or an alien ? 'Cause everyone in the world is one or the other . Robots do what they 're told . Stick with the herd . Aliens , on the other hand , do their own thing . Well , uh , i don 't know . Do i have to choose ? Most people do . So what are you ? ( Man ) okay , everyone .

Um , she 's got kind of a big imagination . And i realize that there 's really nothing I can do about them , So i 'm just trying to make her feel As safe as possible . About that , i know it 's not exactly my place , But your situation isn 't the most stable . My situation ? Your injuries . Your divorce . Look , uh , my divorce is my business . And all you really need to know is that molly is loved And well-Cared for and she 's doing great . She 's struggling , mr . Parkman . Why ? Because she 's having a few nightmares ? Because of these . She started drawing them a week or so ago . Every day , they get a little worse . Oh , my god . And i have to ask you , What is this ? It 's in every single picture . Excuse me . [ Speaking japanese ] What are you doing here , ma ? It 's time to move on , nathan , he 's dead . You don 't know that . Leave his stuff alone . He 's gonna want it when he gets back .

[ Slams punch card ] You know , you 've been here for a few months , butler . I think it 's time i saw some commitment To excellence from you . When i was assistant manager , We were fully set before the first customer Walked through that door . That is how i got this . Paper business is dog eat dog . You gotta live it and breathe it . You gotta want it . Do you want it , butler ? Do you ? Yes , sir . Yeah . Well , we 'll see . The company was formed 30 years ago With a group of like-Minded individuals , Ordinary men and women who were gifted With extraordinary powers . They wanted to help their own . To find them and to protect them . We find people , And we make sure they don 't become dangerous . Now sometimes that can mean making sure they understand Entirely what they 're capable of . And teaching them to use their abilities For the good of mankind . And sometimes it can mean eliminating them . Who the hell are you to judge who lives and who dies ? If i 'm not mistaken , You yourself tried to put a bullet in the brain Of a man named sylar . He was a monster . Yes . And you were willing to kill him for the greater good . You acted on a moral imperative to protect your species . It doesn 't matter one way or the other about sylar . He 's no longer a threat . He 's dead . And now you have molly . You and matt parkman are protecting her . Now we 're not interfering with that arrangement . Far from it . We 're offering to help you . We have resources To offer you , dr . Suresh . The plague . You talked about the disease Which killed your sister , shanti . The virus . Yes . We have the funds you need for your research .

Does that mean you passed your detective 's exam ? With flying colors . Why ? You proud of me ? Mm , depends . Did you cheat ? [ Nervous laughter ] Why would you ask me that ? Reading the answers out of people 's minds , It 's unfair . No , it is my natural talent . You wouldn 't think a baseball player 's cheating 'Cause he 's athletic , would you ? It 's not the same and you know it . No . You know what , i want to talk to you About these drawings that you made at school . You 're changing the subject . Ms. Gerber 's concerned and so am i .

Eh , sorry . Sorry . So i came over on one of the few trade vessels Your emperor let pass . The boat left full of tea , I kept on to find my fortune . You should see what i got paid To fend off those bandits . Kensei takezo does not fight for money . He fights for honor . Really ? Well , as long as it 's honor i can spend . It 's not a bad lot . I mean , i find a stout brute , Put him on a horse , put him in a field , And tell him to shout on About how he 's fearsome old kensei . Then i repair to the branch of a tree And start to pick off the black guards one by one . That 's fighting dirty ! That 's fighting smart , sir . What ? I give him a fair wage . If he lives . No . This can 't be . No . I come from the future . Many years from now . Your noble deeds become part of our history . The future ? Yes . That 's a good one . No , it is true .

And you took the swordsmith 's daughter , The most beautiful woman in all japan for your princess . Oh ! Ow . Smack ! [ Speaking japanese ] She 's the swordsmith 's daughter ?

 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles : We 're developing a human-interactive AI . It 'll change the world . Hello , Mr. Ellison . My name 's John Henry . You taught it rules , but it 's got no ethics . - Wanted to talk ? - I don 't think I can do this anymore . - What if I want out ? - There is no out . Riley . Tell me about the metal , the symbols . At the end of the dirt road is a warehouse . No windows . No way to see in or out . Where 's the metal ? John Connor gave me a picture of you once . I didn 't know why at the time . You were young like you are now . I always wondered what you were thinking in that moment . You seemed a little sad . Like you were remembering something long gone . I came across time for you , Sarah . I love you . I always have . So we got a car full of questions , okay ? - Who shot her , for one- - - Deputy-- Who 'd she shoot ? Good luck there . She couldn 't even tell me the year . On your feet , soldier . Imagine that . No name . No ID . Look , you just tell Alvin that he 's gonna have to wait a bit . She 's not going anywhere . Not with her leg like that . You 're right . You are very right . She is staying put and so am I. - Suit yourself . - Yeah . On your feet . Pain can be controlled . Come with me if you wanna live . Gun . Hallway 's clear . Go . Go ! We need backup . Bullet 's still in your leg . We need to get that out . Can 't do anything until it 's gone . Call him . He can help . No way . I 'm not calling John . It 's too dangerous . Not John . Him . Call him . Please . - You just got here . - It 's an emergency . It 's John . His girlfriend tried killing herself in his bathroom . He 's taking her to the hospital . That 's awful . Hospital could be tricky . A lot of questions . I gotta go . I 'll keep you posted . And the girl ? - How 's the girl ? - Alive . What 's the status ? Paramedics got there before she lost too much blood . What were you thinking , bringing her to the hospital ? Social workers , cops ... . - I can 't believe you brought her here . - I made the call . Live with it . Hey . Riley Dawson , is she all right ? That depends . Who are you ? John 's her boyfriend . - Have you notified the family ? - Foster care . But I don 't think that we should call them . - I think something 's up . Something bad . - I see . By law , I have to place her under a 5150 hold for the next 72 hours . CPS sends a caseworker out to evaluate her home situation and make the appropriate judgment . You 're gonna need to just stay put until CPS arrives . - Say it again . - Listen to me . There 's a warehouse in the desert . A man , Alan Park , told me they 're building something there . Metal extracted from bricks of coltan . Like them . Like the machines . Yeah . What did you see ? Doesn 't matter . Park is dead , Reese . How bad is your leg ? There 's evidence of me all over the Jeep . All over everything . Burn it . Burn it all . I talked to your mom . She found something out in the desert . It sounds like it has something to do with those three dots she 's been after . Is it real this time ? Well , the bullet in her leg sounds real . You stay . I 'll go . You made your call . This is what living with it means . She 'll be fine . I know that look . He 'll push you , doubt you and make you wanna kill him . He 's certainly on the list . He 's out of his time . He 's lost . John 's all he 's got . John and you . We 're all out of our time . We 're all lost . And John is all any of us have . You a doctor ? I 'm a patient . You have a name , right ? You can tell me your name . Inside , now . Okay , go . Move . Sit down . Hey . Ease up . You need her . Reassure her . No time for games . I have a bullet in my leg . You need the hospital . Hospital 's no good for me . - Why ? Did you hurt someone ? - Not today . Not yet . Sarah . No . I didn 't hurt anyone . - May I ? - Hurry . Please . Who hurt you ? Today , I mean . That 's not your problem . Let her help you . She wants to help you . She 's a doctor for a reason . Figure it out . A man . Mm . One man ? God , Sarah . What did it do to you ? Stabbed me . Trying to hurt me . And make me scream . To get to our son . I 'm sorry . - What ? - This man . He 's in your life ? I 'm sorry . We had a fight . It went bad . Really bad . I ran . I can 't go to the hospital . Is he a doctor ? In law enforcement ? He 'll find me . He always finds me . What 's your name ? Sarah . My name is Sarah . AI . Serial number on her gun was filed off . I have no idea where she got it . The gun . Not necessarily her gun . Powder burns . She sure shot it . Standup firefight too , judging by the wound in her leg . - Then there 's this . - Haven 't listened to it yet ? She hasn 't done anything yet . Hospital . Hello ? Oh , hell . She 's still got a slug in her thigh . Gonna make it hard to move real quick . Most people can 't get that needle out . Let alone break that window or choke out a deputy . She is , as they say , accustomed to her circumstance . Talked to the chief resident . Got a doctor who didn 't show for rounds . Doctor Felicia Burnett . Felicia . All right , get an APB out on her hybrid . Check her house , check every parking lot within a five-mile radius . Our mystery woman 's got a problem . She 's gotta get that metal out . Okay . There are two things you need to know . First , this is going to hurt . Second , this is really going to hurt . You said you have a son . What 's his name ? Don 't wanna talk about my son . Women have higher pain thresholds than men especially women who 've been through childbirth . This gonna be like that ? About like that . John . His name 's John . What 's he like ? Tell me about him . He looks like his father . He 's about the same height . But he 's got my eyes . And you trust him . There 's a strength about him . I 'd die for John Connor . I 'd die for my son . First big contraction . Breathe . Hi . How are you ? - I feel like an idiot . - You 're not an idiot . - You 're just- - - It 's okay . There 's really nothing to say . - You 're here too ? - Of course . I 'm worried about you . Well , don 't be . Please . I 'm really tired . I 've had a long day . Yeah . Long day . Come on . You must be stronger than you imagine you can be . You must survive , or I will never exist . What is that ? I 've heard that before . John 's message to you . He made me memorize it before I came back . I 'm not strong enough . I 'm gonna die . It won 't be the first time . - Reese ! - Hey . Hey , hey . Who 's Reese ? - Is it out ? The bullet ? - It 's not out . - I can 't get it out . Not here . - You 're lying . You were out for half an hour . If I were lying you 'd be in a hospital , handcuffed to the bed with guards outside the door . She could 've given you up anytime . She didn 't . The bullet 's dug in just over your femoral artery . You know what that is ? Yeah , I know what that is . Then you know if I nick it , you 'll bleed out and die in four minutes . So don 't nick it . You gotta trust me here . I need a picture of what is going on inside that leg . I need real instruments . You wanna go back ? No , not want . Need . I know what it is to be afraid . Hello , Mr. Ellison . How are you today ? I 'm fine , thank you , John Henry . Are those toys ? Yes . Mr. Murch brought them to me . He thinks these will help me develop fine motor control . They 're very interesting . This is Toa Tahu , the Toa of fire . He wears the mask of Shielding and wields the Myranah Ghost Blaster . He is sworn to defeat the Makuta . I see . They have excellent range of motion in their limbs . It 's from the ball-and-socket joints . This body uses hinge joints in the knees and elbows . It 's less efficient . That body was meant to look like a person . It was made in our image . Oh . - Whose image were humans made in ? - God 's . We were made in God 's image . This body was made to resemble a particular human . This body appeared in Red Valley , New Mexico , in 1999 . It had a different appearance then . In 2007 it kidnapped Dr. Alistair Fleming and forced him to regrow its organic covering . Then it forced a plastic surgeon named Dr. David Lyman to alter its face to resemble actor George Laszlo . Then it killed 20 members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's team in North Hollywood . - And then- - - That 's enough . That 's enough , John Henry . How do you know all this ? I wanted to know about this body 's history so I accessed the Internet and used a simple search parameter . And what was that ? James Ellison . - Mr . Ellison , I have a question . - What is it ? It 's not for you . I have a question for God . What do you wanna ask God ? I wish to know why he didn 't use more ball - and-socket joints when he made you . You 've given John Henry access to the Internet . John Henry has many questions . Mr. Murch thought it 'd be a good idea to give him the capacity to look for answers himself . Well , he 's gotten very good at it . He 'd make a hell of a detective , actually . Still , it seems unwise . Who knows what he 'll find or who may find him . You 're worried about outside forces influencing John Henry ? I 'm worried about what he 's going to become . Who 's gonna guide him . Why , you are , Mr. Ellison . You . There 's a lot of blood in there , some discarded medical equipment . Like someone tried to operate . Whoever was in there is long gone . Now what ? I don 't know . I 've never snuck into one before . - This is crazy . - Sarah . Get the gurney . You know me in the future . What would future me do ? You mean about Riley ? Yeah . What would future me do right now ? Future you has more important things to do . Get your things . You 're checking out . So this Reese guy you were talking about he did this to you ? No . That 's not completely true . If it weren 't for me ... . No . God , no . Reese is John 's father . And he 's dead . I 'm sorry . Look , can we just do this ? Okay . Right . Ahh ... . I 'll come right back . Your leg , it 's bleeding again . I think it 's the bullet . I think it 's moving . It is . What did she say ? If the artery gets nicked , how long do I have ? Four minutes . Sarah ? Where are you ? In the morgue . Is that a joke ? Not a joke . I need surgery . Long story . The warehouse , did you find it ? Not yet . First things first . That is the first thing . Cleanup is the first thing . We have a situation with you . We have a couple situations , actually . - What ? Where 's John ? What 's wrong ? - John 's fine . It 's his girlfriend . - I think she 's turning into a problem . - Been a problem . Yeah , I know . Reese , I ... . I got a problem with this leg . I can tell . You called me . Twice . Sarah , you there ? Sarah ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm here . Don 't worry about John . Hello , Ms. Weaver . How are you ? I 'm well , thank you , John Henry . Mr. Murch said you asked for me . Do you know Solek ? He resides in Karda Nui and idolizes the Toa . He has stated that he 's best friends with Takua . - You 're not human . - Excuse me ? You 're not human . You 're made of metal . Not the same metal as I am , but metal . How can you tell ? I looked into your eyes . There 's nothing there . Have you shared this with anybody ? Mr. Murch ? Mr. Ellison ? No . Should I ? No . You should not . This body contains a high percentage of processed tantalumniobium ... The coltan in this body came from a mine in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo . That 's very likely . I wouldn 't know for certain . In the last 26 months Zeira Corp. has obtained control of 7 percent of the world 's coltan reserves . Is that so ? I have been scanning available sources for the key word " coltan . " I detected this audio transmission on an unsecured line . Got a breach , man shot out at Heat and Air . Damn . Breach ? Well , you know the drill . Shut the place down . Down ? Damn . I got 16 tons of coltan . You know the drill , shut it down . I 'll call- - And you detected that on an unsecured line ? During my scan , yes . Well , that was a mistake . Ms. Weaver ? Yes ? What are you doing ? I can 't answer that right now . But know this , John Henry : Everything I do , I do for you . This thing is an arthroscope . Basically , a camera in a tube . I need to stick it in your leg while I operate . Remember how it felt when I cut you open at the motel ? It 's gonna be worse ? I need to put you under . And I need you to hand over that gun . - Hmm . - Listen to me . That bullet isn 't a joke something you can tough through . It 's going to kill you , do you understand ? - I can 't stop . - You 're not one of them . Gun . - Listen , lady , you don 't- - - I know . Better than you think . Now give me the gun or I swear on a stack of Bibles , I will let you die . Please . Give me the gun . Don 't worry , Sarah . I 'm here . I 'm watching . I 'm always watching . - Is everything all right ? - I was about to ask you the same thing . She 's missing . We 're locking down the hospital and we 're searching room by room . I saw cargo elevators . I 'm gonna see if she 's hiding . You check the parking lot and exits . We need to find her . - No . - No , what ? No , we don 't need to find her . - Jesse , please . - Shut up . Not a word out of you . I found you in that tunnel , scooped you out and brought you to paradise . And this is what you do ? You 're bleeding , love . Let me take a look at that . There was this girl at school , she killed herself . John tried to save her , but the machine stopped him . He doesn 't like to talk about it . So this was all for his benefit ? Can I stay with you ? - People are gonna be looking for you . - Just for a little while ? An hour ? An hour . Careful , it 's rented . And make sure you take everything . Tomorrow at this time , it 's like we were never here . Turn around slowly and keep your hands where we can see them . Do you mind telling me where you keep your demolition materials ? The subbasement perhaps ? No ? I 'll find them on my own then . We come to a stop . At the end of the dirt road is a warehouse . There 's an office in front . No windows . Can I help you ? Nine mm discharge , semiauto . All from the same point of origin . That 's an execution . The gun we found in the Jeep was a . 45 . Different gun . But 9 mm matches the round in our girl . And no one on that tape shot back . - Who are those people on the tape ? - Well , someone knows . Course , he 's got a . 45 caliber hole in him . Ahem . Copy everything we 've got . Send it to the FBI , the ATF and every police outfit inside a hundred miles . Where are you gonna be ? Out in the desert . Looking for a warehouse at the end of a dirt road . She 's covering her tracks ? She wouldn 't dare come here . Holy hell , Alvin . A second shooter ? Could be . Whoever it was , he knows where she 's been , knows her condition ... - ... and I bet he is looking for this . - Right . Go back and secure the office . Call the hospital . Tell them to keep their eyes open for strangers , tell them to steer clear tell them I 'm coming . What kind of tree is that ? Apple , I think . No . No , I know this tree . As a child , Derek and I ate fruit from it . That 's not true . You were never here . I saw an entire orchard on fire once . Skynet flamethrowers . It smelled like apple pie . That 's just a story . What are you doing ? Derek and I used to leave notes for each other . This tree was our marker . See ? I never lie to you . Never . Reese ? It 's okay , Sarah . You 're okay . Hey , easy . - Easy . I 'm here for her . - I know why you 're here . Stay back , or I swear to God you will regret it . You don 't wanna do that . You don 't . You even know how to use that ? It 's tough to shoot with the safety on . You wearing body armor ? I am . Go away , Alvin . Felicia . Put the gun down . Please go . Felicia , baby please put the gun down . Felicia . Put the gun down , you crazy bitch , or I swear on a stack of Bibles- - Alvin . Alvin . - Sarah . Sarah , we have to go . - Reese ? Reese ? - You 're Reese ? - Yeah . You 're not dead ? Not yet . Are you the father ? John 's father ? No . No , he 's not the father . You realize this place is probably locked down . Deputies will be all over us . They 'll think I did this . All you have to do is let them . No , that 's not right . He pointed the gun at me . He put it up against my head . He wanted to kill me . Wouldn 't be the first time . Go . Sarah . Was anything you said the truth ? I got shot . I wanna explain . About John . About your brother . I don 't need an explanation . Sarah . What the hell is that ? That 's where the warehouse is .

 Previously on Heroes ... I have no idea how you 're pulling this off but I swear I won 't stop ' til I figure it out , you understand me ? I 'm just trying to figure out how to take take of our family . I don 't have a job , Jan. They 're going to pay for what they did to me . What they did to us . There is no putting this whole thing behind you . We 've got to find out what they did and make them fix it . You want to know why I was invisible all of these years ? It was because of them - - and you drove the bastards right to my door ! Claire , can you keep a secret ? I think I know how I survived the fire . Please say something . Some family , that 's how I survived it . Your mother has a subdural hemorragy . It 's like a bruise on the brain , in the area that controls memory . - You erased her mind . - It 's ridiculous . You tried to erase mine . - What you know is dangerous . - Why did you do this to Mom ? I only wanted to protect my family . - We 've had enough of that . - Don 't , don 't ! I 'm not gonna nuke the dog . It wouldn 't hurt Mr. Mugles , would I ? If you want to hurt this guy , that would be the way to do it . There are more pictures of dogs around here than there are of kids . You don 't really think he 's stupid or sloppy enough to leave incriminating evidence around the house . He did just get raided by the F.B.I. We couldn 't get a warrant for the house . So maybe on the off-chance that he 's a little lil ' sloppy or stupid , I 'm going to poke around . So now we 're jacking his computer ? You want to sit around all day and download files ? I don 't . If we don 't find anything on his PC , there is another place we can look , inside his head . I plan on that . We 're gonna bag the son of a bitch at his factory , see how he likes it . - Maybe we can bag him here . - Oh God , he 's with his family . Family 's a pretty good motivator . I 'm not taking any hostages . We bag him at the paper factory . That was plan A , plan B is much better . There is no plan B. We leave now . Are you going to let this guy slip through your fingers again ? Lyle , help your mother . Talk to me . What 's the point ? Am I going to remember this conversation ? Keep your voice down . Lyle , take your mother , get out of the house right now . I 'm sure you have a lot of questions . We all do . Honey - - what 's happening ? Dad , what 's happening ? Stay calm . Yeah . Yeah , let 's just everyone , stay calm . Ok ? Everybody stays calm , nobody gets hurt . This is officer Parkman of the LAPD . Formerly of the LAPD . Thanks to you . What do you want from me ? You come into my house with guns . Not guns , gun . I don 't need a gun , do I Mr. Bennet ? - Not after what you did to me . - I don 't know you . If you insist on lying , you 're going to upset me . And you know what happens when I get upset , I get very bright and very hot . Ted is going to do us all a favour , right , Ted ? And he 's not going to get upset . But you gotta help . I 'm not who you think I am , I 'm just a paper salesman . No , no . You 're not . So tell me , how do you feel about paper ? - Wildly enthusiastic . - Good . Because as far as friends and family are concerned , it 's your life . Congratulations . You are the new regional manager for Prima-tech paper . Nice cover . Sorry do make a liar out of you , but it 's part and parcel of what we do . Nobody outside the organization knows . They can 't know . People are fragile . Like teacups . All around them , the world is changing and they - - simply don 't want to deal with it . They don 't want to know what 's happening to us as a species . And they certainly don 't want to know the measures we take to keep them safe . Now you 'll be asked to do things that fall in a morally grey territory . Things that most would find cruel . But men like you and I , know to be necessary . I 'm comfortable with morally grey . Good , you 'll have a partner , one of them . That 's how we do it here , keeps us all honest . - Great , when do I meet him ? - He 's already here . Is this a test ? How did you - - how did you - - how - - how is that ? It 's a brave new world , friend . Go ahead . Tell them what you do . What goes on at that paper factory of yours , Mr. Bennet . He abducts people . He drugs us . He injects us with , I don 't know what . I lost my job . And I am trying not to lose my wife . You don 't care about that , do you ? You don 't care about what you did to me . All you care about is that we think that nothing happened . - Makes us forget . - How can he make you forget ? The Haitian . - That 's right , that Haitian . - She knows ? This is your fault . She knows this is his fault . He 's got all them fooled except for her . Just when you thought plausible deniability was gonna save your ass . The Haitian . Your mother forget and your brother , but not - - Why didn 't he make you forget ? What is he talking about , Claire ? I don 't know anything . You want to put a stop to all this ? All you need to do to keep your family safe , to keep us all safe , is just tell the truth . - I am telling the truth . - No . This is the truth . Oh , my God . This is what did you do me . Settle down , Ted . We just want to be normal again . He 's not a paper salesman . I guess she 's not daddy 's little girl any more . What are they doing ? Claire ? He 's getting inside your daughter 's head . I can run , get some help . They can 't hurt me . Are you thinking about being a hero ? Don 't . Don 't , this guy is serious and he 's really dangerous . And I need your help to make sure that nobody gets hurt . You can read my mind . - Yeah , your dad did it to me . - It didn 't just happen ? I wouldn 't be here if it just happened . Has my dad done this to other people ? As far ask I can tell , it 's different with everyone . I 've seen some weird things . I 'm sure you have , too . Like the stuff at your school . Peter Petrelli . Peter Petrelli ? He can do what I can do . What do you know about him ? He can do what I can do . He 's different . Like you . Save the cheerleader ? I read his mind , he read mine . He told me to protect you . From someone who was killing people like me . Are you different , Claire ? Your blood was all over that crime scene . You didn 't have a scratch on you . Why didn 't you have a scratch on you ? I can heal . Did my dad make me this way ? What are they going to do with the baby ? I don 't know . I wander if they knew about little orphan Annie before they sent us over there to bag a bloody fire-starter . Nah , they would have told us . A word , please . * No sign of the mother ? * We think she died in the fire . * Your son ? * I understand you have no children . * That 's correct . * Having children changes a man . * I can only imagine . * You don 't have to imagine . * You 're going to ... * adopt the baby as your own . * I don 't think that 's a good idea . * It 's not a request . * You and your wife have been trying to conceive , yes ? * Unsuccessfully . And frankly , I 'm relieved . * I don 't think I 'd be a really good father . * Once again , * not a request . * Don 't get too close . * You 're only her surrogate father . She belongs to us . * If she manifests , we 'll take her . * Of course . * Happy Fathers Day . Did you make me this way ? Is that why you adopted me ? Am I some sort of experiment ? - Don 't talk to your father like that . - He 's not my father . They have nothing to do with this . - He 's the one who got them involved . - No . We did you and me , when we didn 't leave the house when they came home . No one 's been hurt , what 's he gonna do ? Go to the police ? We can get out of here right now . - We came for a cure . - What if there isn 't one ? I 'll kill us all . Just - - get inside his head . Get some answers or we 're all gonna have a really bad day . Son of a bitch is thinking in Japanese . Why are you thinking in Japanese , huh ? We want answers . Who are you ? And what did you do to us ? - The safe in the bookcase . - Ted , there 's safe in the bookcase . No ! Stop it ! Enough , we 're done ! We 're not done ! I 'm calling your bluff . Ted ! Ted ! Put the gun down , that 's not going to help anybody . He killed my wife , it 's only fair I kill his . With his own gun too . - Kind of poetic , don 't you think ? - Tell him what he wants to know . Come on , he 's willing to kill us all . Leave her alone . She didn 't do anything ! Claire , sit down . Shoot me if you 're going to shoot someone ! No ! Parkman , you have to trust me , shoot Claire . I 'm telling you , someone 's going to die . Sorry , Mrs. Bennet . Shoot Claire , now ! She can heal . - Shoot me ! - You brought this on yourself . No ! Claire ! What did you do ? Claire ! What did you do ? What did do you that for ? Get his trust . Now he knows how far we 'll go . Right hook . Right hook coming . You killed my little girl ! You did . No ! Tell me it 's not true . Tell me . Don 't leave her here . Move Claire 's body before she heals . They don 't need to see her like this . We 've got to move the body . I had no idea it was going to go this far . Believe me , he was going to kill your wife . I actually heard him pull the trigger in his mind . Thank you for shooting first . Oh my God ! - Where 's Mom and Lyle ? - Downstairs . - Are they safe ? - No . You made her indestructible ? I didn 't make anyone . You don 't have all the facts straight and I don 't appreciate you confusing my daughter . The fact is you work in some freak factory where your ruin people 's lives . You 've been mislead , Claire , I 'll explain later . But right now you have to do exactly what I tell you to do . - I 'm going to the police . - Don 't make the same mistake I did . Don 't put your family at risk . - Parkman ? - Yeah , coming ! The people I work for don 't know about you . If they did , you wouldn 't be here right now . They would have taken you months ago and we never would have seen you again . You say you want a normal life ? That 's what I 've been fighting for . He 's telling the truth . Hate me all you want but right now , this has to be contained . Which means you have to stay put . What , you want me to play dead ? I 'm sorry , I 'm not Mr. Mugles . That man downstairs can generate a chain-reaction which would be like dropping a nuclear bomb on this house . And he 'll do it too . Come on , we have to go now . Do what I say , so nobody gets hurt . - And you - - - Yes . Do what I think . Hey ! Enough ! We already got their attention . We 're not going to find anything here . What we want is at the paper factory . - Really ? - Yeah . Did he tell you that or think it ? We 've got records of the abductions , what they 've done , in exchange for his family 's safety . He 'll get them . I don 't want anybody else to die because of what I 've done to you . Do all the words coming out of your mouth sound like lies ? He 's not lying . We 'll have proof . - No surprises at the factory ? - Just the truth . I 'll stay with the family . You go . No . I 'll stay with the family . I can do more damage here . Whatever you say , you 're in control . Sandra - - I 'm gonna get us out of this . It 's 7 a.m. If you 're not back in an hour - - look for the mushroom cloud . I think my wife suspects something . She went through my bag , she found a gun and a sedation kit . That 's particularly stupid on your part . Letting her find it . The baby has been keeping me up for days , it was sloppy . She thinks I 'm some sort of a serial killer . She 's better off thinking you 're a serial killer than knowing the truth . I don 't know what to do . Is that a new sensation for you , Bennet . Is my wife in danger ? If I said yes , what would be your next move ? Would you pack up Sandra and little Claire and make a run for ? Or would you turn her over ? I 'd do what I 've always done , what I 'm told . But you didn 't answer the question - - is she in danger ? Relax . Nothing 's going to happen to your wife , because she 's not going to remember finding anything . There 's a boy , we discovered in Haiti - - - He can make her forget ? - He 's really something . He 's mute . When we asked him to describe his ability , he drew a picture of himself , pulling memories like little grubworms out of someone 's head . I wanted to put it on the front of my fridge . When he 's done , make sure you thank him for saving Sandra 's life . She 's upstairs . We don 't have time for this . In about 38 minutes , Ted 's going nuclear unless we bring him back hard evidence . The only thing we 're bringing back Ted is a tranquilizer . He deserves to know the truth . He doesn 't want the truth . He wants his wife back . Short of that , he wants revenge of the good , old-fashioned biblical variety . You said yourself , he 'd already pulled the trig anywhere his mind . Ok . So that 's if for him . What about me ? Are you going to send me back to L.A. with my wife and baby and no idea this ever happened so you can pretend to have a happy family again ? I 'm not sending you anywhere . You 're the only one I can trust . Look , here 's the deal . I 'll be honest with you . - You be honest with me . - You just try lying to me . I just signaled the Haitian . You said no one would know we 're here . Until I needed them to . Guess who found out where I live ? What do you think we should do with them ? And guess who found out you can talk ? Who have you talking to ? Who else knows about Claire ? Just you and I. But that will change . She wasn 't supposed to remember any of this . I gave you specific instructions . I answer to someone 's whose instructions supersede yours . In this company ? In your daughter 's life . What 's the mission ? Looking into a security breach , that 's all I know . That 's all they told me . That 's all they told you to tell me but what you know is considerably more . You 're not as good a liar as you think . You 're the security breach . Is that what they 're calling me behind my back ? I was hoping for something a bit more subtle . You Americans are usually good for it . Is it true ? - Are you hiding one of them ? - By " them " you mean people like me ? Is that what you 're accusing me of hiding ? Well , the short answer is yes . You 're compromising what we 're doing . Sorry , I know we 're serving the greater good but it 's keeping me up at night . Seeing as you 're raising one of us as you 're own , - I was hoping for more sympathy . - Claire is not one of you . Not yet , but one day , maybe . Don 't tell me you haven 't thought about it . If she is then I 'll take her , it 's done . Just like that ? Father of the year , you are . - You know who I work for . - So do I. I was in your office when they told you to kill me . Then why did you get in the car ? Evidently I think you 're a better man than they do . Get out . It 's not the first time you 've been told to kill a man , but is it the first time you 've been told to kill a friend ? Tell me who it is and we can forget about the rest . You 're just going to do it . You 're just gonna off me like nothing ? It 's not nothing . We find these people . That 's what we do and you buried one . You acted against the interests of the company . Did you ever stop to think what the interests are ? Who is it ? What if it was Claire ? That 's why you 're so distant from her . You know you 're going to turn her in . You 're preparing for it . You used to believe in what we do . I used to believe in the Tooth Fairy . We made a promise , both of us . I will not haunt my own people . This isn 't who you are . You have a choice - - Why couldn 't you just - - She 's my daughter . You can 't be trusted to put her safety in front of company interests . I 've been hiding her for months . That 's the sort of thing that will get you killed by someone like you . We 're running out of time and we 're not exactly dealing with a patient man . Look , it 's in Claire 's best interests that we contain this and we keep her off the radar . - She could run . - She 's safer in plain sight . Not at the moment . No one is going to be safe unless you give Ted what he wants . Claire ? God ! Thank you . You came back . Go , run ! Get out of here . Go to the back ! Claire ! Get out of here - - run ! Mom ! Go ! Mom ! Claire ! - You should have run . - I could never leave you . Not after I just got you back . I always thought were you a miracle . Didn 't know how much of one until now . I 'm not a miracle , mom . You were dead . Any time someone rises from the dead , I 'd say that 's a miracle . I don 't know what I am . I don 't know if God made me this way or someone else . - God didn 't make us this way . - God makes us all the way we are . I walk throughout fire and didn 't get burned . You were trying to tell me . I was trying not to tell you . All this forgetting ... why I was in the hospital . You think your father did that to me ? I know he did . He said he was trying to protect us . He 's your father . He is coming back to get us out of this . He 's lied to you your entire marriage . What makes you so sure he 'll keep this word now ? Faith . What I 've seen , what I 've witnessed . I can 't pretend it 's same world it was yesterday . God gave you a second chance , find it in your heart to give your father one . I 'm curious about something . Did Parkman know when he shot you that you wouldn 't die ? - Did your dad tell him that ? - I don 't know . That explains why they were so chummy when they came down the stairs . What do you suppose they 're up to ? Guess I 'll just ask him myself . Am I still in control , Mr. Bennett ? You 're still in control , Ted . No tricks . Just what you asked for . The truth . We have what we want , Ted . We have the proof . Then why the theatrics with shooting a girl who can 't die ? It 's better than shooting one that can . We didn 't come here to hurt anyone . If the people I work for found out I 've shown this to you , they will kill me . Since I 'm risking my own life . I would rather not risk my family 's . Do you want revenge or do you want the truth ? You can 't have both . I want the truth . Then let them go . Get them out of here . What is he doing here ? Just making sure my family 's safe . That 's all . You stay , they can go . Go on . Dad . Go . Come on , Claire , let 's go . Come on , come on . Mom , I called the police . We didn 't make you this way . It took you three months to identify you . At the time you were giving off low levels of radiation , you were harmless . And you did nothing to stop it . There 's no cure , we can 't change the way you are . The only choice is to kill you . I wish you had . It was my call . You had a life . Who was I to take it from you ? Because you let me go , my wife is dead . I 'm sorry . So am I. - No , don 't ! - You son of a - - Stop it ! I can 't ! - We gotta get out of here ! - No ! - Dad . - Claire ? - Where 's my dad ? - He 's - - Claire , don 't ! - Dad ! - Get out ! Not without you ! Tranquilizer . Stay down ! I can 't get close enough . - Give it to me . - No . I 'll be ok . Get him out of here . Go ! Claire ! It 's a good thing you called me when you did . This sort of thing isn 't taken lightly . You know well and good what the policy is on hiding them . I 'm well aware . It 's a shame I have to kill another partner . Especially one so useful to the cause . Has he even located , the Haitian ? He must have figured you would turn him in . How long was he hiding Claire ? In plain sight , too . You must feel like a fool . I take it it 's been months . She trusted him over her own father . Surrogate father . Now that we have him , we 'll keep him sedated . We 'll find out what gives him his spark . And then ? What do you think ? He was very helpful . Imagine working with someone like Parkman by your side . Knowing what everyone around you is thinking . It could prove quite resourceful . Certainly keep everybody honest . - Is she one of them ? - Very promising . She 's going to help us clean up the mess you made . - We 're done here ? - Just one more thing . When should we be expecting Claire ? I 'll bring her in now . - Where am I going ? - I don 't know . Will I see you again ? Mom ? Lyle ? I don 't know . I wanted to protect you . You 're my dad . I tried to be the best dad I could . I know . Let 's see ? - Those are grandpa glasses . - Ouch . Even though I am the same age my father was when he needed glasses . How about these , huh ? - What ? - Grandma glasses . - Will I need glasses , too ? - I don 't know . Well , if you need them and grandpa needed them . Won 't I need them ? Your mother and I were wondering when we were going to have this conversation . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing 's wrong . Tell me . I 'm not your biological father . You 're adopted . - Who are my real parents ? - We are your real parents . We don 't know who your biological parents are , but we 're your real family . You can 't be my real family if I 'm adopted . Well what makes us real isn 't where you come from , it 's how much we love you . And we love you you very much . I love you very much . You didn 't grow inside your mother . You grew inside our hearts . Claire , talk to me . Try these on . How do I look ? Like my dad . This is good-bye . You don 't have to do this . - There 's got to be another way . - This is the best way . There can 't be any doubt about your father . Right here . Two inches higher and I 'm dead . Claire , turn around , cover your ears . - Dad . - God . Go deep . Take anything that would lead them to her . I love you , Dad . I love you , Claire bear .

I am so underdressed . Ladies and gentlemen , the Secretary of Defense . please be seated . I 'm John KeIIer . obviously , you 're wondering why you 're here , so these are the facts . At 1900 local ttme yesterday , the SOccENT Forward Operattons Base tn Qatar was attacked So far as we know , there were no survivors . The objective of the attack was to hack our military network . We 're not sure exactly what they 're after , but we do know that they were cut off during the assault , which would lead us to assume that they 're going to try it again . Now , no one 's taken responsibility for the attack . And the only real lead we have so far is this sound . That 's the signal that hacked our network . NSA 's working at full capacity to analyze it and intercept further communications , but we need your help to find out who did this . Now , you 've all shown considerable ability in the area of signals analysis . We 're on a hair-trigger here , people . The President has dispatched battle groups to the Arabtan Gulfand Yellow Sea Thts ts as real as it 's ever gonna get Now I 'm gonna leave you to your offtcer-tn-charge' You 'II break up into teams and you 'II start your work .

We 're not sure what it 's going to do , but it may cripple the system . - Can we stop it ? - Every time we try an antivirus , it adapts and speeds up . It 's like it 's not a virus anymore . It 's become the system . obviously the first phase of a major attack against the US . The only countries with this kind of capability are Russia , North Korea , maybe China . - I 'm sorry , that 's not correct . - Excuse me , young lady . I didn 't see you standing there . You would be who ? I 'm just the analyst who detected the hack . hold on . It was you ? You did it ? - Her team . - Sir , I was just trying to say , they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds . okay . Even a supercomputer with a brute force attack would take 20 years to do that . Maybe you can explain , then , how our latest satellite imagery shows North Korea doubling its naval activity . Maybe it 's a precaution , because isn 't that what we 're doing ? The signal pattern is learning . It 's evolving on its own . And you need to move past Fourier transfers and start considering quantum mechanics . There is nothing on Earth that complex . What about an organism ? A living organism ? Maybe some kind of DNA-based computer ? - And I know that that sounds crazy ... - That 's enough . That 's enough . We have six floors of analysts working on this thing . Now , if you can find proof to back up your theory , I 'm gonna be happy to listen to you . But if you don 't get a filter on that brain-mouth thing , you 're gonna be off the team . You understand ?

You 'II have to accept that there are certain things you won 't understand right away . Sector Seven is a speciaI-access division of the government convened in secret under President Hoover 80 years ago . You may remember NASA JPL lost the beagle 2 Mars Rover . We told them to report the mission a complete failure . It wasn 't . beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds . This was classified above top secret . EDA ended at 170 hours , 48 mtnutes' More than just a pile of Martian rocks . This is the image from Mars . Here 's the image your special ops team was able to retrieve from the base attack . We believe they are of the same exoskeIetaI type , and obviously not Russian or North Korean . Are we talking about an invasion ? We intercepted the message from your special ops team . These things can be hurt by our weapons and now they know it . That 's why the virus shut us down , so we can 't coordinate against their next attack , which I would bet my ridiculous government salary is coming soon . Get word to our fleet commanders over the national Guard frequency . It 's a shortwave radio channel . It might be still working . tell them to turn their ships around and come home . ASAP ! And inform all commands to prepare for imminent attack . Captain Lennox , we need you and your team to come with us right now ! Let 's go ! She 's in here . What 's going on ? You 're coming with me . - You 're going to be my advisor . - Me , too ? Who 's this ? - He 's my advisor . - He comes , too . - So ... - What 'd they get you for ? I bought a car . Turned out to be an alien robot . Wow . Who knew ? Make a hole ! Watch your back ! please , Iet this work . Fire it up , optimus . The code . The code on these glasses indicates the AII Spark is 230 miles from here . I sense the Decepticons are getting ready to mobilize . They must know it 's here , as well . What about BumbIebee ? We can 't just leave him to die and become some human experiment ! He 'II die in vain if we don 't accomplish our mission . BumbIebee is a brave soldier . This is what he would want . Why are we fighting to save the humans ? They 're a prtmitive and vtolent race Were we so different ? They 're a young spectes' They have much to learn But I 've seen goodness tn them Freedom ts the rtght of all senttent betngs' You all know there 's only one way to end thts war We must destroy the cube If all else fails , I will unite it with the spark in my chest . That 's suicide . The Cube is raw power . It could destroy you both . A necessary sacrifice to bring peace to this planet . We cannot let the humans pay for our mistakes . It 's been an honor serving with you all . - Autobots , roll out ! - We rolling ! Team attention ! Present arms ! At ease . Captain , Sergeant . Got your intel . excellent work . Thank you , sir . What about the gunships ? They 're being retrofitted with sabot rounds now . If they hit us again , we 'II be ready for them . But it won 't do us much good if we can 't get world communications back up . Hey , kid . I think we got off to a bad start , huh ? You must be hungry ? You want a latte ? HoHo ? double venti macchiato ? Where 's my car ? Son , I need you to listen to me very carefully . people can die here . We need to know everything you know . We need to know it now . okay . But first , I 'II take my car , my parents . Maybe you should write that down . oh , and her juvie record . That 's got to be gone . Like , forever . Come with me . We 'II talk about your car . Thank you . The man 's an extortionist . AII right , here 's the situation . You 've all had direct contact with the NBEs . NBEs ? Non-BioIogicaI ExtraterrestriaIs . Try and keep up with the acronyms . What you 're about to see is totally classified . Dear God . What is this ? Dear God . What is this ? We think when he made his approach over the north pole , our gravitational field screwed up his telemetry . He crashed in the ice , probably a few thousand years ago . We shipped him here to this facility in 1934 . We call him NBE one . well , sir , I don 't mean to correct you on everything you think you know , but , I mean , that 's Megatron . He 's the leader of the Decepticons . He 's been in cryostasis since 1935 . Your great-great-grandfather made one of the greatest discoveries in the history of mankind . Fact is , you 're looking at the source of the modern age , the microchip , lasers , spaceflight , cars , all reverse-engineered by studying him . NBE one . That 's what we call it . And you didn 't think the United States military might need to know that you 're keeping a hostile alien robot frozen in the basement ? until these events , we had no credible threat to national security . well , you got one now . - So why Earth ? - It 's the AII Spark . AII Spark ? What is that ? well , yeah , they came here looking for some sort of cube-Iooking thing . Anyway , Mr. NBE one here , AKA Megatron , that 's what they call him , who 's pretty much the harbinger of death , wants to use the Cube to transform human technology to take over the universe . That 's their plan . - And you 're sure about that ? - Yeah . You guys know where it is , don 't you ? follow me . You 're about to see our crown jewel . Carbon dating puts the Cube here around 10,000 BC . The first Seven didn 't find it until 1913 . They knew it was alien because of the matching hierogIyphics on the Cube as well as NBE one . President Hoover had the dam built around it . Four football fields thick of concrete . A perfect way to hide its energy from being detected by anyone or any alien species on the outside . Wait , back up . You said the dam hides the Cube 's energy . - What kind exactly ? - Good question . please step inside . They have to lock us in . oh , wow . What 's that ? Freddy Krueger done been up in here or something ? oh , no , man . Freddy Krueger have four blades , man . That 's only three . That 's wolverine ! - Right ? That 's wolverine ! - That 's very funny . Anybody have any mechanical devices ? blackberry ? Key alarm ? cell phone ? I got a phone . Nokias are real nasty . You 've got to respect the Japanese . They know the way of the samurai . Nokia 's from finland . Yes , but he 's , you know , a little strange . He 's a little strange . We 're able to take the Cube radiation and funnel it into that box . - Mean little sucker , huh ? - That thing is freaky ! Kind of like the itty-bitty Energizer Bunny from hell , huh ? He 's breaking the box . Go ! Go ! Go ! Move ! gentlemen , they know the Cube is here . Banachek . What 's going on ? well , the NBE one hangar has lost power ... - What ? - " ' and the backup generator - tsjust not gonna cut it - Do you have an arms room ? Megatron ! Megatron ! Megatron !

That 's good . Get all the ammo you got . Everything you can carry . Bring it . You got to take me to my car . You have to take me to my car . He 's gonna know what to do with the Cube . - Your car ? It 's confiscated . - Then unconfiscate it . We do not know what will happen if we let it near this thing ! - You don 't know . - Maybe you know , but I don 't know . You just wanna sit here and wait and see what happens ? I have people 's lives at stake here , young man . Take him to his car ! Drop it . Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Drop your weapon , soldier . There 's an alien war going on and you 're gonna shoot me ? You know , we didn 't ask to be here . I 'm ordering you under S-Seven executive jurisdiction . S-Seven don 't exist . Right . And we don 't take orders from people that don 't exist . - I 'm gonna count to five. okay . - well , I 'm gonna count to three . - Simmons ? - Yes , sir ? I 'd do what he says . Losing 's really not an option for these guys . AII right. okay . Hey , you want to lay the fate of the world on the kid 's Camaro ? That 's cool . No , no ! Stop ! You got to stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! No , no , stop , stop , stop ! Let him go ! Let him go ! Are you okay ? They didn 't hurt you , right ? Listen to me . The Cube is here and the Decepticons are coming .

They 're not gonna hurt you . Here , come with me . I 'm gonna take you to the AII Spark . okay , here we go . He doing something . He doing something . oh , my God . Message from Starfleet , captatn' Let 's get to it He 's right . We stay here , we 're screwed with Megatron in the other hangar . Mission City is 22 miles away . We 're gonna sneak that Cube out of here and we 're gonna hide it somewhere in the city . Good ! Right . But we cannot make a stand without the Air Force . This place must have some kind of radio link ! - Yes . Shortwave , CB . - Right , yes . Sir , you got to figure out some way to get word out to them . Let 's move ! In the alien archive , sir ! - The alien ... - There 's an old Army radio console . - will it work ? - Anything 's possible ! - Did you see that ... - AII right , Sam , get it in the car !

How do we get the signal out ? How do we call the Air Force ? - glen ? - Huh ? Can you hotwire this computer to transmit a tone through the radio ? What good is that ? Morse code !

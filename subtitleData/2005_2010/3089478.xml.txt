 Previously on Heroes . Ordinary people across the globe discovered extraordinary abilities . Niki 's alter ego sought revenge ... - Must really hate the guy . - He took my son . ... and took the ultimate retribution . Peter set out on his mission ... I know when , and I know where the cheerleader gets attacked . I have to stop him . ... to save the Cheerleader . By saving you , did I save the world ? I don 't know . I 'm just a cheerleader . But he was taken by the police ... Put your hands on your head ! It 's not what you think , guys ! What are you do ... And Sylar was finally captured ... You don 't want to hurt me . Go to sleep . And Claire revealed a secret that would change her life ... - You 're lucky to be alive . - It 's not luck , Dad . I have something I have to tell you . And now Heroes continues . Are you mad at me ? You haven 't said anything since we got in the car . Since I told you . No , no , no , I just ... I 've just been thinking . Um ... I have something I need to tell you . It 's not fair to keep it from you any longer . What you can do ... I 've known about you , Claire . I knew before you knew . Before you made those tapes with Zach . You saw the tape ? - Why didn 't you say anything ? - There are a lot of reasons . But mostly , I just wanted to protect you . Protect me ? All this time , I 've ... felt so alone , and like some sort of freak . - And you knew ? - I 've worked very hard . I 've done some things that I am not proud of to keep you safe . What kinds of things ? I just wanted you to have a normal life . Jackie died because of me . He thought she was me , didn 't he ? That man is taken care of . I promise you . - You and mom knew all this time ? - Your mother doesn 't know . Neither does your brother . - Actually , Lyle kind of found out . - Really ? - Did anybody else ? - Just Zach . Nobody else can know . It 's the only way to keep you safe . That man who tried to kill you , there are others out there like him . Who want what you have and will hurt you to get it . That 's why we can 't tell your mother . We can 't tell anybody . - Do you understand ? - Yeah . I 'm gonna pick Lyle up from practice , and I 'll talk to him . You talk to Zach . Any other tapes you 've made ... I need you to destroy them . The victim was a student : Jacqueline Wilcox . And the crime scene fits Sylar 's M.O. He took her brain ? No , but the incision in her skull said he wanted to , but somebody got in his way . They have a suspect in custody , a hospice nurse from New York . - And you think he might be Sylar ? - No . I think this is . Judging by the blood patterns , I 'd say he stopped here to catch his breath , and then just ... disappeared . You know what ? Maybe he didn 't . Look at this . The tread pattern 's totally different . These are two new sets of footprints . - That 's the fourth handful of those you knocked down since ... - I have headaches ! It 's the whole Janice thing , it 's ... She slipped out , Parkman . And it sucks , but it happens . - You 've never cheated on her ? - No . - You don 't believe me . - Well , statistically speaking , law enforcement attracts a certain kind of male personality . - Oh , what personality would that be ? - Dogs . - And the female personality ? - Mmm , bitches . We keep it in the canine family . Okay , so two new sets of footprints . You think Sylar had accomplices ? With the amount of blood he lost , there 's no way he got out of here by himself . So I guess we 'll ask this ... Peter Petrelli . Chapter Eleven - Fallout Nathan . What are you ... What are you doing here ? You get in trouble , I drop everything and fix it . Isn 't that how things work ? - Get you out of here soon . - What , no lecture ? I 'm just glad you 're alive , man . Why did you destroy that painting ? Why did you try and keep me from coming here ? The painting showed you dead , Peter . And when I got the phone call , I nearly believed it for a minute . - Yeah , I thought I 'd be a hero . - Yeah , heh . How 'd that work out for you ? Save the cheerleader , save the world . You 're meant to do a lot of things , Peter . Saving the world isn 't one of them . You gotta learn to recognize when life is bigger than you are . You 're not a fighter . But that 's okay . The world needs nurses too . When I 'm around you , I can do what you can do . Isaac , Hiro Nakamura , this girl Claire . See , I think that we 're all the same somehow . And this bomb that Isaac painted , I think we 're supposed to stop it . But I just ... I don 't think I can do it . That 's because you can 't . How can you stop what 's coming ? When you don 't know anything about power ? - Micah ! - Dad ! Stay down ! What are you looking at ? - Anything ? - Slept through the night . I got this . You lost a lot of blood . We sewed you up the best we could . Turns out you 're not so untouchable after all . Oh , no . No , you 'll find your abilities won 't work . Not here . - You 're not going anywhere , Gabriel . - My name is Sylar . Now it is . Wasn 't so long ago that you were Gabriel Gray . An insignificant watchmaker . I restored timepieces . Do you know why I was so good at it ? No , why don 't you tell me . Because I can see how things work . What makes things ... tick . Like you . We 're interested in how things work as well . Everyone else we 've ... met has had only one ability . - You 've taken on several . - I guess that 's what makes me special . That 's important to you , isn 't it ? Being special . - It 's important to everyone . - I think you 're insane . I think the infusion of so many alterations to your DNA has corrupted your mind . - All this power is degrading you . - And yet here I am , alive and well , and as soon as I get out , I 'm gonna collect one more ability from your daughter . - Sweet , innocent . - That 's enough . - Ripe , indestructible . - I said that 's enough , Gabriel . My name is Sylar ! Options ? There are no options with an individual like this . Maybe I didn 't make the risk clear ... - Understood . Of course . - Is it true ? You have to be a little bit more specific , Eden . I 've got more than one house on fire at the moment . - We 're keeping him alive . - Those are our marching orders . Think about what he almost did to Claire . I could tell him to kill himself . No one would have to know . I don 't have time for this . Not today . You know I 'm right ! I know I 'm right , and if that ... that Haitian could speak , he 'd tell you I 'm right ! Micah , take that . Here , take ... That 's it . Walk back the way you came . In the footsteps . Come on . - Oh . Like the Indians . - Just like the Indians , son . - That wasn 't the police . - You don 't know that . Dad , they 've gotta warn you before they shoot . It 's a rule . The police don 't always follow the rules , son . Trust me . Give me a hand . Right here . Okay . Dad , are you gonna be okay ? I 'm gonna be as good as new . I just need you to help me with these bandages . - You can do that , right ? - Yeah . Yeah ? All right . It was her , wasn 't it ? It was Jessica . It sure looked like your mom . Mom would never hurt you on purpose . She just did , Micah . A couple inches to the left ... and ... D ad ? Dad , wake up ! Dad , you need to wake up ! Your brother 's pretty well connected . Even down here . We had to climb over six lawyers to get to you , Mr. Petrelli . Are you okay ? My head feels like it 's gonna split open . Help yourself . - I didn 't kill that girl . - We know . The blood we found on you was your own . We checked you out , and you don 't seem to have any injuries . Care to explain that ? If I 'm not being charged , can I go ? What 's a hospice nurse from Manhattan doing at a high school homecoming in Texas ? You some kind of pervert ? My brother said not to talk . We don 't need you to talk . What are you doing to me ? " Save the cheerleader " ? Too late for that . The cheerleader 's dead . Claire 's dead ? No , that 's not possible . Did he just read her mind ? Is he one of them ? The cheerleader 's name was Jackie Wilcox . - What the hell is going on ... - No , Claire is the one that he wanted . - Claire ? - You 're not protecting her ? ! - Why would you know who he wanted ? - You wanna catch this guy ? You need to find her . You need to protect her ! - He 's telling the truth . - Then we better find this cheerleader . - You 're not gonna let me out of here ? - You get out when I get answers . Welcome Home ! I knew you 'd be back ! Now get back to work . Love Eden . I faxed the list to your Quantico office yesterday ! Names , addresses . Why didn 't you warn them ? Looking into it ? At least six of the people on this list are dead , all of them from the same killer . James Walker in Los Angeles was killed nine days ago . Charlene Andrews two days ago , Midland , Texas . Doesn 't this mean anything to you people ? Well , do you really want to take that chance ? Fine , I won 't . Never mind . You 're sketching . I am . - And you 're sober . - The locks on the door help . - Anything interesting ? - Nothing predictive , if that 's what you 're asking . I don 't think I can do it clean . You 'll get there . To be honest , it 's nice to be drawing just to draw again . That 's what I liked about comics . You don 't have to take them too seriously . Good guys catching bad guys ? Which reminds me ... Claire . The cheerleader ... She 's alive . - Peter ? He saved her ? - No , you did . With your gift . I mean , thanks to you , Sylar won 't be able to hurt anybody anymore . This means we can change the future . Maybe stop that bomb . Well , I wish you the best of luck . What ? - Where you going ? - Off the reservation . You 're leaving ? Well , what good is painting the future if no one will do anything to change it ? So change it . I couldn 't save Charlie . And now the Cheerleader is dead too . " The earth is doomed ? " " Save the Cheerleader , save the world " We failed to save her , - so now we can 't save the world . - No , no . " Save the Cheerleader . " Then " Save the world . " - No , it 's an " if , then " statement . - How do you know ? I was the one who said it ! " Future you " doesn 't count as you ! Never mind . Two people died . If we don 't continue they died for nothing . We will find a way . We must . How ? Get back on mission . Find Peter Petrelli . Find the artist . Stop the bomb . Destiny hasn 't forgotten us . - Hello ? - Hiro ? - Hiro Nakamura ? - Yes ? - This is Isaac Mendez . - Mr. Isaac ? ! - Hiro ... we need to meet . - Who is it ? Destiny ! I wish ... Destiny would lose our number . And then he grabbed her and ... and I tried to save her , but ... he was killing her , and ... She told me to run , so I ran . I left her and I ran . I 'm sorry , Claire . I know you 've been through a lot . I just have a few more questions . This man ... Did he exhibit anything out of the ordinary ? You mean besides killing my friend ? - No , like being able to fall five stories and walk away without a scratch . - What ? Well , you said Petrelli tackled the man who killed Jackie , and they both fell over the ledge . That 's a pretty long fall . - Is Peter okay ? - He survived ... without a scratch . - How do you think he did that ? - All I know is he saved my life . He 's a very lucky guy . You didn 't seem to get hurt at all , either . Guess I 'm lucky too . We found some of your blood at the crime scene . Look , I 've told you everything I know , okay ? Do you have what you need , Agent Hanson ? Yes ... of course . Thank you both very much for your time . Wait , can I talk to Peter ? - Excuse me . - Yes ? Mr. Bennet , I just want to let you know that we 're doing everything in our power to , uh , - to get this guy . - Well , I appreciate that , Mr ... Uh , Parkman . Uh , Officer Matt Parkman . I really appreciate that , Officer Parkman . Thank you . You don 't have to be a mind reader to know she 's hiding something . - What is it ? - I didn 't get anything . I mean , I ... there was this distinct ... - absence of sound . - You mean silence ? No , it was more like a static interfering with my ... - Whatever the hell this thing is . - That 's a new one . No , it 's not , actually . I 've heard this before . Once , when I went to that bar . It 's the last thing that I heard , or didn 't hear , before I lost a day . DL . Did she ... Did I ... Uhh ! Get up ! - What did you do ? - What I had to do to get Micah back . If you cared about Micah , you wouldn 't have taken those shots . - You could have missed . - I don 't miss . - You saw DL 's jacket . - DL 's Micah 's father . DL is a criminal . He brought danger into our home . - You want Micah to end up like that ? - You 're wrong about him . - You 're out of control . - What do you know about control , Niki ? You 're part of me . - You do what I say . - It doesn 't work like that . - Not anymore . - Why are you doing this ? - Because you 're not strong enough . - Mom ! - Micah ! - Mom , is that you ? Coming ! - You 're okay . - Thanks to you . Mr. Petrelli , I 'm Claire 's father . - Hi . - You saved my little girl . I owe you my life . I was just in the right place . Maybe one day I 'll be in the right place and can return the favor . - Are you feeling all right ? - Yeah . Fine . Hey , Dad , can you wait outside ? Of course . How long have you known ? Known what ? That you 're like me . You would have died if you couldn 't ... Wait , do you ... Do you heal ? Is that it ? All this time , I thought it was just me . Now there 's you . Is that why you came for me ? Is that why you ... - asked me if I was the one ? - No , I just ... I knew I had to save you . - Why ? - To save the world . - What do I have to do with the world ? - I don 't know . Yet . I do know that I don 't think I would be here if it wasn 't for you . I think I died . I 've died before . It 's no big deal . I 'm not like you , Claire . I ... This , uh ... This healing thing is kind of new for me . Wait ... you didn 't know that you were gonna heal when you dove off the building ? N o . - That 's kinda stupid , huh ? - No , it 's not . You 're totally my hero . Micah ! Mom ? Mom , is that you ? Mom ! - Dad 's hurt . - Where is he ? In there . He 's bleeding ... bad . Stop fighting ! - Stop fighting ! - It 's for your own good ! Micah ! Micah ! Are you okay , son ? Micah ... Stay away from him ! It 's me , baby . Mom , is that you ? It 's me . I am so sorry . I 'm so sorry . - Hey . - Hey . So what have people been saying ? Well , the official word is that somebody got killed in the high school . But everybody knows it 's Jackie . I got , like , four text messages this morning . - Did you bring the tapes ? - Oh , yeah . There wasn 't that much to bring ... That 's pretty destroyed , right ? Yeah , I don 't think they 're gonna play again . Look ... I feel really bad . About breaking you out and pushing you to go to homecoming last night . I 'm sorry . You shouldn 't feel bad . You did it because you 're my friend . Probably the best friend I 've ever had . You know , I 've only been your friend for two weeks . Hey , I didn 't say it wasn 't pathetic . - You know , you could have been killed . - I know . Look , I gotta go . My dad just wanted to ... make sure that you weren 't gonna say anything to anyone . - Of course . Cross my heart . - Thanks , Zach . - Hiro Nakamura , I presume . - Mr. Isaac ? This hasn 't even gone to the printer yet . It 's ... it 's incredible . You really went to the future . - Jumping through time , I mean ... - And space . Your power very strong too . I 'm not so sure about that . I can only do it when I 'm chasing . Uh , stoned . On drugs . Uh ... What else did you see there ... then ? Oh , um ... I saw the bomb . It exploded the city and destroyed many things . And I saw you . What about me ? I saw you on the floor . You were dead . With your head ... cut ... off . Okay . The man who cuts off heads ... he 's taken care of . - He 's caught ? - That is very good news . Hiro lost a friend . The brain man killed her . Wait a minute . I painted this two days ago ... sober . - Is this your friend ? - Yes . I did it . You say your mission is to stop the bomb . In New York . - Yes , uh ... our destiny . - I think it may be mine too . I painted that mural on my floor . And very recently , I painted a picture of ... a man exploding . How do you stop an exploding man ? Mom ! Dad ! Mom 's at the store . I don 't know where Dad is . Did Dad talk to you ? About what ? About me . He knows . And he knows that you know . My thing . That I can 't get hurt . - That didn 't hurt ? - Lyle , I 'm serious . Now tell me what Dad said to you . I haven 't seen Dad all day . - He was supposed to pick you up from practice . - Well , he didn 't . Well , how 'd you get home ? Lyle . How did you get home ? I-I don 't remember . - I can get you some help , Nik . - You don 't understand . There are doctors that can help with situations like this . - D , she 's stronger than me . - I don 't believe that for a second . You 've seen what she can do ! How do you explain that ? There are a lot of things that I can 't explain . - Like why you shot me . - Jessica shot you . And she 's gonna come back and take Micah . She 's out of control . She could really hurt him , even ... I can 't be trusted . Nik ... Micah . - You all right ? - Yeah , I 'm okay . Come on . Gonna get you to a hotel . We gonna get you cleaned up , all right ? Nik , we 're gonna go to a hotel ... Nik ? - Can I help you , ma 'am ? - Yeah , you can arrest me . Arrest you ? For what ? Murder . Really , Parkman . Since when does absence of noise warrant a stakeout ? You always say I don 't take you anywhere . Well , you sure know how to spoil a girl . Eat your tex-mex . Gotta say , he can be cute . Oh , God , did he just hear that ? Did you just read my mind ? You can 't do that . It was a stray thought , I ... You can 't do that . You really think I 'm , uh ... cute ? I really think you 're married . - And I really think you love your wife . - I do . Then why haven 't you called to yell at her , so you can go home already ? That 's what you want , isn 't it ? I don 't wanna be a chump . So still loving your wife after she has sex with someone else makes you a chump ? - Doesn 't it ? - Grow up , Parkman . If you want your marriage to work , you have to find a way to make it work . Otherwise , you are kind of a chump . Cheerleader 's dad , 9 : 00 . That guy that 's with him . I know that guy . - From where ? - He was at the bar ... the night I first heard that static . But how do you know ? I thought you lost that whole day . Matt , maybe we should get out of here . Hold it , I 'm just trying to get ... something . - I was only able to get one word . - What ? Sylar . All right , Claire , I 'm here . What 's the emergency ? Something 's going on . It 's like The Stepford Body Snatchers or something . My brother doesn 't remember anything . What I can do , nothing . It 's like they made him forget . All right , so this is another one of your little cheerleader initiation pranks . Is that it ? Hmm , is it ? Zach , are you listening to me ? Something is going on ! What is your damage ? Look , you haven 't talked to me since sixth grade , and now you call me out of the blue ? What is this about ? They got to you too . Are you on crystal meth or something ? 'Cause this is really cracky behavior . Claire . You see yourself as some sort of humanitarian , don 't you ? A do-gooder , a hero . Kidnapping men and women who are different . Does that make you feel powerful ? We 're quite alike , you know . You collect special people . So do I. We 're gonna take you apart , Gabriel . Like one of your little watches . Sorry ... timepieces . And we 're gonna find out exactly what makes you ... tick . I don 't think I can do this . Yes , you can . Concentrate . - Hello ? - Tell me you remember . Y-you remember what I told you ? Last night . Don 't you ? You remember what we talked about ? Of course I do . What 's going on ? You said that there were people who wanted to hurt me . I think they got to Zach and Lyle . They don 't remember anything . It 's like it never happened . I don 't know what to do . - Where are you ? - I 'm at home . Where 's Mom ? - Where 's ... where 's Lyle ? - Just stay where you are . I 'll be right there . I love you , Claire . - You 're gonna be okay . - Okay . No ! No ! No ! I work for your father . He sent me here to make you forget . Like he sent me to your friend . And your brother . And to your mother so many times . He 'll be here soon , expecting that ... you won 't remember anything . But it is very important that you do . Tell me , Claire . Can you keep ... a secret ? What will we do once he paints something ? Maybe we should make sure he is okay . I thought he only paint the future ... Oh no ! What if I step on a bug ? I could change history ... Change history ? You 're gonna die ! I really need to find that sword ... - Hello ? - Mohinder ? - It 's me . - Eden . Look , I 'm not who you think I am . I lied to you , and I 'm really sorry . And I 'm gonna explain it all to you soon . Wh-where are you ? What 's going on ? First , I need to make things right . Starting with killing the man who murdered your father . Eden , wait , I ... I do know you , don 't I ? I live next door to Chandra Suresh . That wonderful ability . The power of persuasion , and this whole time , you were the girl next door . I 'm gonna take this gun , and I 'm gonna put it in that slot . You 're gonna take it , and you 're gonna blow your brains out . You knew , didn 't you ? You knew what I was , and you let it continue . In a way , you helped me . And after I 've consumed your power , you 'll help me even more . Oh , Eden , you know that won 't hurt me . - What are you doing here , Nathan ? - Let 's go . Aren 't you gonna ask what happened ? I know what happened . You got yourself in trouble . - You nearly got yourself killed . - No , I saved a girl . Had to be a hero , didn 't you ? - Got it out of your system now ? - I finally get it now , Nathan . I have these dreams , and when I 'm around someone with an ability , - I can do what they can do . - You look like hell . And I was with that girl and that guy that was trying to kill that girl . And this cop , I think he was reading my mind . - They were all like us . - Dysfunctional ? No , they ... Nathan , I have to stop that bomb . I have to save everybody . Right now , I 'd settle for you walking straight . Peter ? Peter ! Easy . Easy . It 's all right . It 's all right . - It 's all right . - It 's all my ... fault . The explosion . What are you talking about ? It 's me . Breathe . Breathe . Peter ! Peter ! Peter !

 NARRATOR : Previously on Fringe : A storm is coming , and when it is over , I fear there will be little left of our world . They 've been looking for someone someone to open the door between universes . Laston-Hennings Cryonics was hit . Took everything . - The cryo-capsules are gone . - They found who they were looking for . BELL : Remember this symbol . It 's on their leader , that 's how you 'll know . And if they find him , there will be no stopping them . And that is why you must find him first . MAN 1 : A girl in a red dress . Flowers in her hair . MAN 2 : Hm . What kind of flowers ? I 'm not sure . MAN 2 : Think , Mr. Slater . It will come . Heather had the flowers in her hair . The flowers in her hair are heather . Oh , I think so , yes . Container . Now , hold very still . I assure you , there will be no pain . Let 's close him up . Hold on . Yeah . We 've got activity . ( MACHINE BUZZING ) Code Gray , Corridor B. We have two minutes , maybe three . My sincere apologies . I 'd rather not leave you in such a state . ( BEEPING ) Mr. Slater ? Help me . Fringe s2e10 Grey Matters Special Agent Olivia Dunham with the FBI . These men are consultants . Peter Bishop and Dr. Walter Bishop . We 're here to investigate the break-in . - And you 're Dr. Bishop ? - Yes . And I 'm perfectly sane . Joseph Slater has been a patient here for the last 14 years . When he was admitted , he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia . His file said he suffered delusions and false memories . Severe emotional swings . Every classical symptom of the condition . He exhibited each . - Until last night . DOCTOR : That 's right . Within an hour after discovering what had been done the change in his behavior was remarkable . So basically , two guys broke in , cut a big hole in his head and did what , drove him sane ? As unlikely as it sounds , yes . And just as strange , we can 't find evidence that they did anything to him . Mr. Slater 's brain is structurally intact . We ran blood tests , tox screens . Nothing came back unusual . We 'll need to see his medical reports . - And also his personal history . DOCTOR : Of course . ( MAN GROANS ) Doctor , I 'd like to see the patient . That 's where we 're going , Walter . To see Mr. Slater . Peter , we 're going to see a sane man . I 'd like to see him when he was a patient . No , no , no . The girl in the red dress . Chrysanthemums in her hair . Her mother grows them in a box on the windowsill . DOCTOR ( ON TV ) : And where does this little girl live ? Across the street . No , Joseph , she doesn 't . JOSEPH : She ... She moved . DOCTOR : She was never there . What did you do with her ? What did you do ? What did you do with her ? You give her back . Give her back . Bring her back . Bring her back . Bring her back . - You can 't describe either of the men ? - To be honest , I barely remember them . My first clear memory of last night was turning from my window . Miss Holbrook was there , one of the nurses . She was scared . They raced me to the medical ward . But what struck me was that I felt unburdened . Like my mind had had a spring cleaning . - Like I was suddenly ... - Free . Yes . And I seem to remember them being pleasant . Polite even . - But beyond that , nothing . I 'm sorry . - That 's okay . - Anything else ? - No , not right now . Thank you . Okay , in that case , Mr. Slater , your wife is here . They tell me that she came to visit me twice a week . I think I remember being horrible to her . I think it 'll be fine . She 's right outside . Yeah . Thank you . WALTER : He 's a lucky man . Seventeen years I was in St. Claire 's , never a single visitor . Walter . Oh , I wasn 't trying to make you feel guilty , son . It was just an observation . Walter , have you had any theories on how this man is suddenly sane ? No , not yet . But I 'm eager to . The remedy for insanity . As you can imagine , I 've thought long and hard about it . There they are . Huh . You see that lock ? Can you zoom in right there ? That 's elliptic curve crypto . It 's the top of the line . These guys took it down like a bicycle lock . Whoever these guys are , they 're either very smart very rich , or very well-connected . Can you play that bit back ? - What ? - Freeze it there , when he turns around . I know that face . Can I use this ? And some privacy , if you don 't mind . - You know him . - Mm-hm . PETER : Where do you know him from ? - From Laston-Hennings Cryonics . Are you referring to the theft of the frozen heads ? Yeah . William Bell told me the people from over there that tried to kill me , that killed Charlie , they were looking for someone . WALTER : They were looking for their leader . OLIVIA : Well , I 've been combing through Laston-Hennings ' files to figure out of all the heads they took , which was the one that they wanted . I 've been looking at these faces for the last two months . Are you really trying to tell us that he is one of the heads they stole ? Fine , let 's say for a second that you 're right . Frozen heads don 't get up and walk into places . The dead don 't rise out of their graves and perform midnight brain surgery . No , I know they don 't . But this one did . Thomas Jerome Newton . Wow . Newton . So , what do we know about him so far ? Besides his name , nothing . Thomas Jerome Newton was the name on record at Laston-Hennings Cryonics but it was an alias . It led nowhere . Bell told me the man with that marking would try to open a corridor from our universe to the other side . I managed to infer that the results would be less than desirable . Exactly how much less desirable ? Global destruction . Biblical proportions . What 's that have to do with sneaking into a hospital to perform brain surgery ? Leaving out the part where they cured him . As opening moves go , that one 's strange . Where 's Dr. Bishop on this ? He 's trying to figure out how they cured Slater . If he can , maybe we can anticipate Newton 's next move . There 's no maybe . I don 't know what Newton 's up to , but I know what I have to do . I have to stop him . Mr. Slater 's referring doctor was a psychiatrist called Simon Paris . See if you could locate Dr. Paris , please , dear . I have some questions about Mr. Slater 's medical history before his admission to Hennington . Sure . Why ? What are you looking for ? I 'm not sure . Something that would induce the delusional thinking . Something . Something or someone . You mean you think that someone made him crazy ? On purpose ? It 's a theory . The truth is there is no cure for madness . It 's a fantasy . The road back from madness is a struggle . Only the luckiest of people find their way more or less back to the world you live in . And from what we saw of Mr. Slater well , my only supposition is that he wasn 't mad to begin with . No Simon Paris in the AMA database . He 's not on the membership roster . - Does that mean he died ? - It shouldn 't . Even if he had , there should still be a record . Huh . Um Paris ' Rx number will be on Mr. Slater 's initial prescription when he was admitted . Check the pharmacy records . Why would someone do that , Walter ? Make someone crazy ? WALTER : Any number of reasons . Make them insusceptible to interrogation , for one . ASTRID : Huh . According to this , 14 years ago Dr. Paris set up an indefinite prescription of medications for Mr. Slater . No termination date . Oh , this is interesting . In the same week , he wrote the same prescription for two other patients . - In the same week ? - at two other hospitals . I 'll call Olivia . And when I woke up , I felt like I had been out drinking the night before only the night lasted 14 years . It says here you suffered from a severe form of obsessive-compulsive disorder ? Yeah . Arithmomania , they call it . You were obsessed with numbers . Just one , actually . Twenty-eight . I 'd see it everywhere , hear it everywhere . I could never get it out of my head : 28 , 28 . Then , uh , last Tuesday morning I woke up and it was gone , just like that . Like suddenly I was free . And your doctors have no explanation ? Between you and me , I think that 's why they 're keeping me here . One of them 's hoping to get a paper out of it . So , what does this have to do with the FBI ? We 're not sure . Maybe nothing . But do you mind if we look at your head ? - My head ? OLIVIA : It should only take a minute . Is there somewhere that you could sit down ? Excuse me . DEBORAH : What are you looking for ? It 's here . Fresh scar , but there are no sutures . Looks more like the burn from a surgical laser . I don 't understand . What kind of scar ? What are you saying happened to me ? Mrs. Crampton , did you have visitors during your stay ? My husband , my son . What about the doctor who referred you ? Dr. Paris . No , never . I only saw him a couple times , before he sent me here . But it was Dr. Paris who diagnosed the arithmomania , right ? Oh , no . He saw me for mild depression . Postpartum . Told me I needed to rest a few weeks and sent me here . The arithmomania just started one day . - How we doing ? - It should work but we took too long getting to Slater . The first specimen 's dying . The nutrient bath won 't keep it alive more than five hours . Six if we 're lucky . Then we better get moving . PETER : A third patient , Stuart Gordon . Just like Mrs. Crampton . Fourteen years ago , Dr. Paris refers him to a mental hospital with the psychiatric equivalent of a cough which then develops into schizophrenia . Two days ago , he miraculously recovers . Mr. Gordon thought he was the actor Sydney Greenstreet . Walked around quoting Casablanca . That 's funny . What ? Well , he looks a lot more like Peter Lorre . That 's a joke . All my life I 've been able to understand what drives people . Their emotions . Like greed , or envy , or revenge . But Newton , these people we 're up against ... How can I fight what I can 't understand ? Olivia , I know you think you 're alone in this . Maybe because of what Bell told you , maybe that 's just your personality . But this isn 't just your fight . That was Olivia . Stuart Gordon is just like the others . Two days ago he woke up perfectly sane . He 's got a fresh scar on the back of his head . I must have missed something . When did Mr. Slater have an organ transplant ? I 'm sorry ? One of the drugs Dr. Paris prescribed is sirolimus . It 's an anti-rejection drug . It 's only given to transplant patients . It 's absolutely useless for a paranoid schizophrenic . Suggests that not only has Dr. Paris vanished he 's a quack . Unless he 's a genius . What ? Organ transplants . The human brain . Well , half of one . But it 's useless . Dead . Because when you remove brain tissue from a living body you can keep it alive in a nutrient suspension but eventually it will die . It 's a problem I 've tried to solve without success . Keeping a human brain alive ? Very tricky . You see , it 's not enough to simply give it blood and oxygen you have to give it electrical stimulation as well . But Dr. Paris found a solution . He stored the brain tissue inside of another brain . I 'm sorry , I don 't follow . What brain tissue ? Our mental patients . Mr. Slater , Mrs. Crampton and Mr. Condom . - Gordon . - These are a few years old but you see the slight discoloration here ? PETER : Mm-hm . WALTER : Normally that would be machine error but this is not a machine error . This is foreign tissue . That 's why they were all on anti-rejection drugs . - So the surgeries Newton performed ... - Was removing transplanted brain tissue . And my hypothesis explains the patients ' madness . Putting the tissue of one person into the brain of another it 's like putting a motorcycle engine into a car . - It 's simply incompatible . - Right . The host mind would have no way to process the new information . Thus the mental distress . The false memories , delusions . But as soon as you remove the foreign tissue , then they 're fine . Correct . ( PHONE RINGS ) - Agent Farnsworth . WEST ( OVER PHONE ) : Hi , this is Dr. West . You asked me to see if we had any information on Dr. Paris ? We didn 't . - Oh . All right , thank you for checking . - I 'M not finished . We also checked with our affiliated facilities . - Oh ? - Well , that just leaves more questions . Why cut out someone 's brain and store it inside other people ? And whose brain is it ? That 's a good question , and I have no idea . Peter , can I , uh , speak to you a moment ? Walter , you never had visitors in your time at St. Claire 's , right ? That 's right . According to their records , Dr. Paris visited you on six separate occasions . Mind if I take a look at your head ? Mm . Okay . PETER : It 's there . It 's different , it 's older , but there 's definitely a scar . I can see from your chart that you 've been though this procedure before . Several times , in fact . This is not a good idea , Peter . These MRI machines have magnets that rip the metal out of the patients and I have that tracking chip implanted in my neck . The GPS locator . - I ... - Have absolutely nothing to worry about . Because it 's made out of silicone . You know as well as I do that it won 't be affected by the machine . Maybe some Valium would help . Oh , I don 't do Valium nearly enough . It 's a good idea . I 'll have 50 milligrams , please . Well , that 's quite a high dosage . I have quite a high tolerance . All right . Thank you . You 're going to be fine . It 's a routine procedure . And the Valium will take care of any claustrophobia . I 'm not worried about claustrophobia , Peter . What do you think that man did to me ? I don 't know , Walter . But we 're gonna find out , okay ? - You okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , Walter wanted to stick around and wait for the results but there 's Walter on drugs , and then there 's Walter on drugs . I had Astrid take him home . Did you see the look on his face when we were talking to Mr. Slater ? What do you think that 's like for him ? Wishing that he could turn back the clock to before he went crazy . He 's just sane enough to realize how much he 's lost . I don 't mean to sound callous but from what I know of your father going crazy made him a better person . It certainly made him a better father . ( SIGHS ) I should have visited him in St. Claire 's . I think you 're making up for that now . I 've reviewed the scans of your father 's brain . - And ? - You should take a look . WEST : I 've never seen anything like it . Three scars , all on the same side in the left temporal lobe . These incisions go all the way down into the gray matter . - I 'm not following . - He didn 't have tissue implanted . - He had it removed . - Yes . From the hippocampus . And there would be no medical reason for it . So , what does it do ? The hippocampus ? It controls our inhibitions , helps store long-term memory contributes to our spatial awareness . You have the scans of the other patients ? Sure . - What are you thinking ? - Hold on a sec . This is the piece they put in Slater . Look . It 's a perfect fit . WALTER : I took too much Valium . Confusion , dizziness , nausea . I think I must have miscalculated the doses . Maybe we should take you to a hospital , Walter . I don 't want to go to a hospital . I need Violet Sedan Chair . - Walter , you 're not making any sense . - No , dear . Violet Sedan Chair . It 's a band . Their debut album it always helps me come down from a Valium high . It 's in the lab . We should go get it . Walter . No , you do the driving . I might puke in your car . Why don 't you stay here and rest , and let me get it ? - Okay . - That might be the best . I 'll be back . OLIVIA : It must be Paris . He must have removed pieces of Walter 's brain . But why ? And why preserve them ? Memory . The hippocampus . Memory storage . Bell told you Newton wants a door to the other side . We already know Walter has done that . He just can 't remember how . That is why he can 't remember . He literally had the memories removed . No way . - So then how does Newton read them ? PETER : In theory , he shouldn 't be able to but he should be a frozen head . In the department of " how to make impossible things possible " what would he need to do ? He would need to implant the memories into a brain that could interpret them . Walter . ( PHONE RINGING ) - Hello ? PETER : Astrid , where are you and Walter ? ASTRID : I 'M going to the lab . He 's at your house . He sent me to get him an album . - How long ago ? - Five minutes ago . You gotta get back there . Walter is in danger . I 'm on my way . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Calm down , Agent Farnsworth . You don 't have to wake the whole neighborhood . Hello , Dr. Bishop . Peter . He was already gone when I got here . I 'm sorry , Peter . I shouldn 't have left him . It 's not your fault . You didn 't know . I got an idea . Last week when Walter got lost , he did what you 'd expect . He implanted a chip into his neck so that if he ever got lost , I could find him . ( BEEPING ) He can 't be far . Let 's go . Hold still , please . This won 't hurt a bit . I 'm sorry , do we know each other ? Oh , we will . This is a mild sedative . Something to calm your nerves . I 've already had 50 milligrams of Valium . Then this should be very enjoyable . ( RECEIVER BEEPING THEN PHONE RINGS ) OLIVIA : Dunham . BROYLES : What 's your 20 ? Two blocks south of the Boyleston T-Stop . Boston PD is sending an entry unit . I 'M sending them to your location . Keep going . Keep going and take the next left you see . The human brain is a fascinating organ , but it 's not static . Remove or damage a section it reroutes the connections and grows in new pathways . Now , figuring out where the old connections once were can be very tricky . Take the next left . ( RECEIVER BEEPING RAPIDLY ) Here . Down here . AGENT : Go . Go , go . Move , move ! Walter ? AGENT : Clear . They found the chip . I 'm going to show you a series of photos . When you see an image , I want you to tell me the first thing that comes to mind . There are no right or wrong answers , but please tell me the truth . If you don 't , I 'll know . You 're using associations to map my brain function locate my neural pathways . Are you trying to fix me ? I 'm afraid not . Tell me what you think when you see this . My first semester of Organic Chem . My lab partner and I used to sit up at the back sniffing benzene fumes . ( CHUCKLES ) Peter . Peter . Peter . I 'm sorry , I know this is difficult . It 's not working . He 's not making the connections . - Should I recalibrate the machine ? NEWTON : No , no . We need to find something more powerful to stimulate his memory . Human memory is sensory-based . Vision alone is not the strongest trigger . Sound and smell actually work better . We need the proper context . Okay , Walter said brain tissue can 't survive for long outside a human body . They 've gotta be close . Raised the alert at every hospital , facility and clinic in the Boston area . We 're even calling veterinarians . Assuming they need a hospital to complete the procedure . With their technology , we can 't know . It 's a start . And if we 're wrong , we 'll have to get creative . The girl in the red dress . How did I miss this ? The girl in the red dress , 2828 , Sydney Greenstreet . Dr. Paris ' patients ... They all had obsessions . Slater was ranting about the girl across the street the one that we thought never existed . She did exist . She lived across the street from me as a kid . Her name was Sydney . She lived at 2828 Green Street . So those were Walter 's memories . Memory is all about context , all about association . Every time Walter asked for a piece of food or music or art he was trying to re-create a moment to help remember . - Which suggests what ? - I don 't know . I don 't know . But if they 're trying to get him to remember how he built a door maybe they 're gonna take him to the place that he did it . - Raiden Lake . The lake house . PETER : No , no . That 's where he opened the door , but it 's not where he had the thought . WALTER : This place looks familiar . The last time I was here was a different season . The leaves were falling . Yes , this place exists in both worlds . You see , but on my side , the trees died long ago . And the same thing killed the grass . They call it the Blight . - That 's terrible . - It is , isn 't it ? MAN : Smith is on lookout , and I 've taken care of the Rubels . - They 're secured . - Good . Now , Dr. Bishop , I can see which areas of your brain can make sense of the data that 's stored in these slivers of flesh . In a perfect world , I would simply put it back . I would never subject you to a process so crude . But this is the only way we can reconnect these pieces of your brain . ( GASPS ) MAN : The connection is complete . - Now , Dr. Bishop you do know where you are , don 't you ? Of course I do . This is my home . - It 's working . - Where 's my wife ? Where 's my son ? ( CHUCKLES ) - You drugged me . - Yes . And now I have a question for you . You once built a door . A door that let you walk between worlds . Tell me how you did it . How are things on your side ? Worse , I 'm told . I know why you built it , the door . I know what you 'd lost . Now , are you going to pretend that you 're willing to lose him again ? Now , tell me about the door . - We got company . - They 're here . That 's okay . We 're done . We 've got what we need . My apologies , Dr. Bishop . ( SIGHS ) Walter ! Walter . Walter . Can you hear me ? Walter . Walter . Can you hear me ? Walter . Hello , son . Could you help me ... ? Ha , ha . It 's okay . I 'm , uh ... I 'm with the FBI . They just left . Out the back . Freeze , FBI ! Come out of there . Step down slowly . Keep your hands where I can see them . You so much as twitch and you won 't have a head left to re-freeze . Are they mine ? Yep . My brain tissue , Peter it 's dying . Whatever was in there memories I 'll never get back ... It 's all right . You don 't need them . ( CHUCKLES ) Hello , son . Hello , son . ( GAGS ) Walter ? Walter . - Hey . Walter , look at me . Walter . - Ugh . There 's something you should know . It 's about Walter Bishop . He 's going to die unless you do exactly what I say . I injected him with a neurotoxin , and unless he gets the antidote in four minutes , it will kill him . Call it my fail-safe to ensure my escape . You 're bluffing . - It 's me . - They 've done something . I don 't know what it is , but I think maybe he 's been poisoned . - His pulse is racing . - What did you do ? Ask him if he sees a medical kit I left behind . Olivia , you gotta get back here . Please . Please , I need your help . Okay , Peter , listen . Do you see a medical kit ? - There 's one on the table . Why ? - There are three vials in the kit . Injected in the correct order , they neutralize the toxin . - Tell me . - Oh , no , no , no . Not yet . You have about two minutes until Dr. Bishop dies . At a flat run , I estimate about 40 seconds until you get back to him . Now , hand me your phone and when I hear you from Peter 's phone , I 'll tell you what to do . You 're crazy if you think I 'm letting you go . Olivia , please , I need your help . I think he 's dying . Oh , God . Walter . Walter ! NEWTON : The choice is yours . You can have me or Walter Bishop . NEWTON : One minute , 45 seconds . Come on , Olivia . PETER ( OVER PHONE ) : Olivia , please . Help . Make your choice . Me , or Walter Bishop . Go to hell . Give me your phone . Okay , you son of a bitch . NEWTON : Do you have the medical kit ? - Got it . Okay , tell me how to do this . Blue , yellow , red . Okay . Blue , yellow , red . NEWTON : And , Olivia ? Now I know how weak you are . ( GASPS ) Peter I have a terrible headache . And a sudden craving for chicken wings . OLIVIA : He was right . I made an emotional choice . I chose my friend over my responsibility . And we have no idea if Walter gave Newton the plans for the door . Walter doesn 't remember . And the brain tissue that Newton extracted is dead . - And Dr. Paris ? - Nothing . He 's vanished . So all we have is more questions . I mean , who is Paris ? How did Newton know about Walter 's memories , and why did they let Walter live ? I suspect that 's the way this is going to be . The more answers , the more questions . - We didn 't get any answers . - Sure we did . We 've given our enemy a name and a face . That 's something . And you saved Dr. Bishop 's life . That 's something too . Because despite what you think you made a rational choice , not an emotional one . If you 'd captured Newton , or killed him , that wouldn 't have been the end of this . But there 's only one Walter Bishop . And we 'll be needing him before this is over . And don 't be so hard on yourself . We 're gonna be needing you too . They just wanna make sure everything 's okay . I know . I should have visited you , Walter . While you were in St. Claire 's . Oh , that 's okay , Peter . If you had , I probably wouldn 't have remembered anyway . I 'll be right outside if you need me . He 's ready , Dr. Paris . PARIS : His system is completely clean ? No sedatives ? No anti-depressants ? - The electrodes are in place . PARIS : Good . Hello , Walter . Are you comfortable ? Comfortable ? I 'm frightened , Belly . I wish there was another way but what you 've accomplished ... It 's just too dangerous . But what if we ever have to go back ? Don 't worry . Your memory , I 'll put it in a place that only I can find . Now , listen to me , Walter . You designed a door to the other side . I want you to think about that door . ( SAW BUZZING )

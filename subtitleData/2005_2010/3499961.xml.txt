 Ladies and gentlemen , please welcome the man who knows what you 'll do before you do it , the amazing Frank Cadillac ! ( scattered applause ) Here 's to world peace . ( laughter ) Good evening . Welcome to beautiful downtown Las Vegas . How many people are here from the Orient ? Raise your hands . You , sir . Where are you from ? No , wait , wait . Don 't tell me . I 'm sensing ... you must have soul . You 're a Seoul man . Why don 't you share with everyone where you 're from ? – Korea . – How about that , folks ? And may I assume that this charming young lady is your daughter ? – She 's my wife . – Well , of course she is ! And what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas . – What 's your name ? – Yong Kyunge . Yong Kyunge , would you be kind enough to join me up on stage , please ? Are you serious about this guy ? Is this a joke ? Want me to round up some clowns while we 're at it ? Yong Kyunge , what if I told you that that pretty necklace has a broken catch , and on my count of three , will fall in your drink ? Wouldn 't that just blow your mind ? – Yeah . – Yes ! Wouldn 't it blow all your minds ? Three , two , one ... now . Did somebody say " spooky " ? Wait a minute . Look at your glass . Where did it go ? Yong Kyunge , why don 't you look inside my pocket ? Reach in . Dig deep . Let 's have a big hand for Yong Kyunge . Well , that 's magic , folks , and that 's why I 'm here . ( Frank ) You 've probably seen a lot of those shows - mentalists , magicians , illusionists . You 'd be shocked to know that sometimes - not often , but sometimes - it 's the real deal masquerading as an act , hiding behind a few $ 50 tricks , hiding in plain sight . Because if the magician doesn 't do that , the alternative is impossible for others to live with . Anyway , Wednesday night at the Back Page doesn 't pay very well , so I gamble . But I don 't play against other people , only against the house . So , no mega jackpots , no long shots . The idea is to go unnoticed . That way I can keep coming back . I 'm not a God . I can 't see everyone 's future , only my own , and only within two minutes , except for when I saw her . But we 'll come back to that . There 's no pattern . He 's all over the map . Well , he 's not counting . Not off the top of a five-deck shoe . Wait . Isn 't that that two-bit magic act over at the Back Page ? What 's his name ? Cadillac . – Yeah , that 's Frank Cadillac . – Is he pulling tricks on us ? Is that legal ? – You can 't trick the deck . – That little prick knows what 's coming . If he 's that good , why is he not betting more ? That was gonna be my second question . Look at that . He 's looking right at us . It 's like he can hear us . – ( man ) What table was that ? – 27 . Roybal . Send men to table 27 . I 'm coming . ( woman ) Place your bets , please . Here 's the thing about the future . Every time you look at it , it changes because you looked at it . And that changes everything else . ( woman ) 9,070 . Empty the drawer . Move . Drop the gun now ! ( woman ) Hi . 9,070 . Drop the gun ! Step back ! It 's his gun . He was gonna shoot two people . Step back . We 'll settle this right now . ( man ) What 's he doing ? Secure the doors , elevators , escalators , every way out of this place ! ( man over radio ) Freeman , seal off the tables . Sullivan , link up with Roybal . – ( Roybal ) We 're on the floor . – Bring up the other cameras . That way , this way . He 's right next to you . $ 10 slots , aisle 1 4 . There he is . Behind you . Your left . Turn around . He 's right between you . He 's in the men 's room near the gift shop . Gift shop ! Davis , where the hell is he ? Straw hat , heading towards the entrance . Come on , let 's go . Call Vegas PD . He just stole a silver Charger , tag 585G4S . ( tyres screech ) ( Roybal ) Drop the gun ! Step back ! He topped our gambling-fraud wish list two months ago . What he does has nothing to do with luck . It 's definable ability . Look . He knows exactly what to do to not be caught . Can you explain that to me ? No , I can 't explain it , Callie , nor do I have the time . The Russians have a ten-kiloton nuclear munition unaccounted for . – I understand that . – I 'm not sure you do . We need every agent available beating the street . That bomb was stolen five weeks ago . We 've just been informed of it now , which means it could be parked under this truck . I need actionable intelligence , not paranormals and bullshit magicians . With respect , sir , this magician has shown awareness that is statistically impossible . You let me bring him in and you 'll get what you want . Five days , Callie . That 's it . Get me the head of casino security . – Are you Roybal ? – It 's Roybal . – Whatever . – Who are you ? Cavanaugh . Take a walk . ( sighs ) Hey , Roybal , this isn 't a pissing contest . Come on . – What did you do ? You got a new car ? – I stole it . Look at this . 20 minutes to walk 20 steps . Well , that 's what you get from two packs a day . Oh , hey , uh ... Yeah . I got you two sandwiches . – Two sandwiches ? Oh ! That 's 20 grand . – Come on , take it . I love you . Oh , jeez . How can I repay you ? Oh , it must be a bitch to park this thing . ( Cavanaugh ) Chief Roybal . Agent Ferris . Everything you say is admissible in court . Anything you omit can be used against you . Do we understand each other ? – Sure . – Tell me about Cris Johnson . – I don 't know him . – Frank Cadillac ? You chased him out of your casino tonight . Yeah , I know Cadillac . I thought he was cheating . Next thing , he 's waving a gun . The gun wasn 't his . The man he tackled is wanted for two casino killings . He 's in custody now . Come on . I wanna show you something . You remember this ? Oh , yeah . We were saying he 's looking at us . How 'd you get this ? Think carefully . What were you talking about right when he looked up ? – We were asking why he didn 't bet more . – You weren 't saying anything else ? – I was going to pick him up ... – That 's when he looked up ? Be specific . That 's what I said . He looked up , really . He doesn 't have to be there . Once you enter his consciousness , he picks it up . – Is that to work his system ? – Thank you . We 're finished . You 've done some good , but none of it is up for discussion . As far as you 're concerned , Cris Johnson never existed . That 'll be difficult considering a hundred cameras saw him . Not to worry . Those tapes have been destroyed . Hey , is she single ? Cris , you can 't keep stealing cars and having people chase you . That 's not a life . But you gotta forget this girl that you keep seeing in your head . Well , I 'm not going anywhere until I meet her . Well , suppose she don 't show up ? She already did . At the diner . Nine minutes after eight . You got a couple of hours . How about a game of pool ? All right , Irv . We 'll shoot some pool . We timed every hand . The longest was 89 seconds , when he pulled a six-card 21 . So he can see at least a minute and a half ahead . I had our techs run a radio-frequency spectrum analysis . It came up dry . He 's not receiving any form of electronic help . At one point there was a two minute , 16 second delay . He never bet , just got up and walked away . Maybe 2 : 16 's too long – he can 't see that far . It narrows our window a little bit . We got him . Vegas PD got a LoJack hit on the stolen vehicle . OK . About that girl . When you looked at the clock , did you happen to see a calendar ? Because it could be ten years from now she gets hungry . It 's got to be soon . I 've never seen further ahead than two minutes . Except for her . Now , what do you think the reason is for that ? I don 't know . Maybe she doesn 't scare easy . Maybe she 's the one . Well , when you get like this , there 's no talking to you . She 's almost here . – What happened to the diner ? – Somebody else , a cop . A cop ? Well , then , you gotta go . Hold on . I want to see how much she knows , what she wants from me . Cris Johnson . Still here , huh ? Where else would I be ? Special Agent Ferris . Next time , steal a car without LoJack . – Can we speak privately ? – ( chuckles ) Uh , it 's OK , Irv . Go ahead . Thanks . I 'm sure you know why I 'm here . Cos you 're the man who knows what I 'm gonna do before I do it , right ? Oh . The show . Right . Right . I saw you there . Wonderful . Uh , you like magic tricks ? Yeah , yeah . I do like your magic tricks , clairvoyance , whatever you 're calling it . Let 's talk about something hard . A stolen munition is being smuggled into the States , or may , in fact , already be here . I want you to look ahead and tell me where it 's gonna be deployed . Uh ... I ... I think you 've got the wrong guy . It 's a ... magic act . Are you gonna stick with that story ? Cos millions of lives are at risk , and you could maybe prevent a major catastrophe . On a practical note , you have a stolen vehicle and you 're wanted for assault involving a weapon . That was an accident . He was gonna shoot two people . Yeah . How do you know that ? No good deed goes unpunished , does it ? I can fix your legal problems , but you 've got to step up , otherwise your next magic show is going to be in Folsom State Prison . It 's ironic , but ... people like you who try to help have been torturing me , in the full sense of the word , since I was three years old . What did they call it ? Uh ... Oh , yeah . Observed play therapy , featuring the marathon 36-hour , can-you-guess-the-next-flash-card game . So , please , leave me alone and let me live some semblance of a normal life . I 'd love to indulge your feelings , but I am dealing with a larger picture right now . Exercise your responsibility to help your fellow man , or I will exercise that responsibility for you . You 're right . I gotta go . He 's gone , right ? I missed him by seconds , didn 't I ? Excuse me . Honey , can you get off my car ? Yeah , thank you . Jeez . – Mr Roybal ? – It 's Roybal . Can I help you , man ? I have a few questions , if this is a good time . Gaming Commission ? It 's after-hours . You should be at a strip club . What can you tell us about Cris Johnson ? I don 't know who you 're talking about . ( screams ) Let me rephrase the question . ( woman , echoing ) It 's destiny . – Here you go , hon . – Thanks . Excuse me . Hello . I noticed you were alone too . Do you mind if I join you ? Actually , I do . Oh . Sorry to bother you , but I have a question about the coffee . The Bean they use ... Isn 't that something you should probably ask your waitress ? Yes , it is . Excuse me , do you have a light ? I don 't smoke . – Here you go , hon . – Thanks . Please . Don 't . – Hey , Liz . – Did you follow me here , Kendall ? No . No . I just thought we could talk . You know , we got nothing to talk about . And I told you that three weeks ago . Liz , come on , all right ? I ... I had an off day . Just give me another shot . It 's not gonna happen , so maybe you should just go . Do you know how hard it was to find you ? I was at your apartment , Starbucks on Lexington , the dry-cleaner . All I am asking for is a few minutes of your time so that we can work things out . OK . Jesus , you are stalking me now . Don 't ... don 't say that , please . – That 's a terrible thing to say to someone . – Let go of me , Kendall . Look , I thought we could talk , maybe take a drive , and now you are ruining it . – You 're hurting me . – Kendall , you 're having another off day . – Who the hell are you ? – I 'm her future . Really ? Hi , my name 's Cris . Are you OK , Kendall ? See , the thing is , I feel connected to you . I don 't know the reason why . See , now , listen . I think it 's only fair that you pay for the lady 's breakfast . What ... what are you having ? The pecan pie 's amazing . Excuse me , I can pay for my own breakfast . You know what ? You two work things out . – You 're hurting me . – Kendall , you 're having another off day . – Who the hell are you ? – I 'm her future . Really ? Incoming . – Goddammit ! Kendall ! – Don 't blame me ! This is your fault ! Get out of here ! Will somebody please call the cops ? I am so sorry . Are you OK ? Let me help you . Come on . Let 's get you cleaned up . Come on . OK . I 'm seeing some stars . Yeah . I 'm Liz . Cris . You must have a death wish getting involved in that . – Here . Just ... – OK . Just ... OK , hold it there for a little bit . – OK . – Yeah . ( sighs ) – It will . – What will ? Your luck . It 's gonna change . What are you , a leprechaun ? Ow . Ow . Uh ... uh ... Do leprechauns get punched in the face or have their car stolen ? – Your car was stolen ? – Yeah . I 'm hoping they find it today . I 'm supposed to be in Flagstaff . Hey , is this ... is this tooth loose here ? Uh ... I don 't know . I don 't think so . It hurts . Listen , maybe I could give you a ride . I 'm kinda going that way . That would really be helpful , Liz . Thank you . – Well , I do have to make a stop , though . – That 's OK . It might take a few hours , if you 're cool with that ? Hey , look . Uh ... If you 're uncomfortable with this , I 'll take the bus . No , no , no . It 's fine , it 's fine . You 're not a psycho . Right ? The first psycho vibe I get , you 're out of the car . – OK . Yes , ma 'am . – OK . Deal . Deal . It 's amazing , isn 't it ? I end up in a diner where you are and we 're both headed in the same direction . I don 't know if I would call it amazing ... Destiny . That 's what it really is . OK . I 'm starting to get that psycho vibe . Oh , no . You don 't believe in destiny ? Well , even if it does exist , I don 't think I wanna know . If every move we make is preordained , then what is the point of that ? I mean , life is supposed to be a surprise . Isn 't it ? It would be nice . Yeah . Yeah . So he came in twice a day for a week at exactly nine past eight ? Yeah . He 'd stay a few minutes , have a martini and then he 'd go . Till today , when he met that lady . – You didn 't find that strange ? – Not enough to call the police . We 've got a regular that counts his cornflakes . – Got any cameras ? – Inside ? No . Outside ? No . Did you notice what he was driving , overhear where they were going ? They were headed up to Flagstaff . – Flagstaff ? – That 's what they said . We 've got another regular who 's always on a diet . Brings her own dressing . – Thank you . – You 're welcome . The guy knows we 're after him , but still risks coming . – 8 : 09 , twice a day . – He doesn 't know if it 's day or night . He was waiting for her . There 's a traffic cam , bank , 7-Eleven across the street . Maybe we 'll get lucky and catch him in wide . Your buddy Roybal had his throat cut last night after getting a kneecap shot off . You tell me now ? We talked to him about Johnson . – Hey , I just found out . – All right . Local weapon ? Dead end . And forensics came up empty . Not a hair , not a fibre . Somebody wants information . If anything else happens , I wanna know right away . – I don 't care if it 's a paper cut . – OK , boss . The head of casino security , what did you learn from him ? For a macho guy , he screams like a girl . But he was questioned by federal agents looking for Cris Johnson ? He said they haven 't found him yet . Do you believe this shit — that he can see things before they happen ? It makes no difference what I believe . Look , we 've spent two years setting this up , and that man out there is worried all this will be compromised by Johnson . We 're wasting our time looking for some magician . We 're being paid to secure the operation , Jones , not hunt down a carnival barker . Really ? Then why are the authorities that are looking for us so interested in him ? Get rid of him . Do it now . – ( speaks Havasupai ) – Hey . Havasupai reservation . I teach here once a week . The conditions are pretty lousy . But it 's in the canyon , one of the Eight Wonders of the World . – Hey , Sam . – Hey , Liz . A couple of hundred years ago , they were booming . Plenty of food , thriving culture . They should be better off , but I guess this was just their destiny . I 'd like to meet their shaman . I read once that in many North American tribes , their shaman 's purpose wasn 't only healing . They also claimed to have power over the atmosphere , to bring on or stop rain . Even know future events . – Do you think that 's possible ? – I believe anything is possible . Me too . – Whose birthday ? – One of my students ' . – Hey . Hi . How 's it going ? – ( children laugh ) Oh , hello . How is everybody ? Good ? ( girl speaks in Havasupai ) ( repeats Havasupai phrase ) – That 's good ! – Well , I was close . You messed up the last part . – On the last part , yeah . ( laughs ) – I thought you weren 't back till Monday . I 'm not , but it 's Jake 's birthday . How could I miss that ? – Who 's that man you 're with ? – Is he your boyfriend ? No , no . He 's not my boyfriend . He 's just my friend . – I think he likes you . – Well , why would you say that ? Cos he looks at you like my brother looks at his girlfriend . Jake , do you wanna see some magic ? I 'll show you something . Come here . I found this rock out in the canyon . I want you to hold it cos it 's a magic rock . That 's right . Hold it really tight . Keep squeezing . It 's magic . ( Jake ) Oh ! He won 't bite . Happy birthday . So you 're a magician ? Well ... I have a small magic act back in Vegas . – The Frank Cadillac Show . – I thought your name was Cris . – It is . Frank Cadillac is my stage name . – How did you come up with that ? Well , I picked two things I really liked and I put them together — Frankenstein and Cadillacs . You are odd . Charming , but odd . ( buzzer ) ( man over PA ) Cease-fire ! Visitor on the range ! Nice . A little close , though . OK . You were right about the traffic cam . We got a positive ID . ( thunder ) I 'm sorry . Don 't be . It 's OK . – Did I drool ? – Drool ? – Yeah . – What ? No . Oh , my God . It 's coming down so hard . – Yeah . – ( yawns ) I like rain . I like rain too . You know , once , I think it was in Denmark , it rained fish because the sun dehydrated the water and took it up into the atmosphere , rehydrated the fish eggs and they hatched and it rained fish . – Is that true ? – Yeah . In the clouds . True story . It happened 50 years ago . I just felt like sharing that with you . Road 's washed out ahead . You can 't cross till morning . Spin around and go back two miles , take your second left . – There 'll be a motel there called ... – The Cliffhanger . Thanks . Right . Him , right ? ( Callie ) That 's it ? There 's no front plate . Where 's the other side ? I don 't have it . What was that on the front window ? Go back . Back , back ... back . There . Zoom in . That 's a permit . Track it and find her . I 'll light a fire . Um , Cris , one little problem . Oh , no , no . No , no , no . I 'm gonna sleep in the car . OK . Here . – Thanks . – Sure . Hey , did you hear the joke about the Zen master who ordered the hot dog ? No . He said he 'd have one with everything . Good night . Good night . – What do we have ? – They 're at the Cliffhanger motel . We found a foreman who remembered the Land Cruiser . – Why would he do that ? – The road was flooded . He was about to suggest a place to stay ... – But Johnson already knew , right ? – Exactly . Callie , it just got worse . All right , people . We 've got a nuclear alert , code red , in the southern California region , LA to San Diego . 95 % certainty . Nuclear search teams are on the way , but until they get here , can somebody please tell me what my agency , the FBI , is doing about it ? Well , sir , tier-one suspects have been interrogated , cars and premises have been checked . We 've opened up surveillance , but nothing actionable yet . We wait for something actionable when eight million lives are precarious at best ? Widen the net to " slightly suspicious " and get some intel before this nuke blows up Los Angeles ! All right , Callie . What do you propose we do next ? The urgency of the situation compels the use of all resources to obtain Johnson . We know where he is . Let my team pick him up . Ils sont en train de se mobiliser . Je compte neuf voitures . – " Vous avez I 'image ? " – Oui . He said they 're mobilising . Standard procedure when security is escalated . Tell him to wrap it up . They 'll lead us straight to Johnson . Nettoie tout et fous le camp . On les suit . OK . Je suis sur le chemin . You hungry ? There 's a coffee shop down the road . – I 'd rather eat here , if that 's OK ? – Sure . – What ? – Uh ... Um ... There 's an Italian painter named Carlotti , and , uh ... ( clears throat ) ... he defined beauty . He said it was the summation of the parts working together in such a way that ... that nothing needed to be added , taken away or altered . That 's you . You 're beautiful . Wow . Uh ... That was incredible . What was ? This . Right here gives us a good standoff position and view of the motel . We can run multiple point and area surveillances from this road here . – Get a team with a parabolic set . – I also want mobile surveillance . And give me two or three roamers . If he rabbits on us , I want to be flexible . Ferris . Tell the local police to hold the outside perimeter . I want that area locked down . A body turned up in an apartment with a line of sight to my office . Slit throat . Somebody 's trying to follow us to Johnson . Cris . Yeah . Maybe there is such a thing as destiny . Give it 40 seconds . – He 'll stop seeing what 's gonna happen ? – I sure as hell hope so . – Elizabeth Cooper ? – Yeah . Federal Agent Ferris . – What is this about ? – I 'll need a few minutes of your time . Yeah , OK . – Ils la mettent dans la voiture . – They 're putting her in the car . Drop the gun ! Step back ! It 's his gun . He was gonna shoot two people . – This was three days ago ? – He used you to get away from us . You can be pretty sure that everything he told you is a lie . He 's delusional . A sociopath . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , shit . Oh , shit ! Go back to the motel . Have a drink , put one of these in his glass . It 'll take five minutes to put him to sleep , then we 'll get him . Nobody 's been hurt . But this is important . You need to do it at least two minutes after you get him out of the room . Uh ... Why do you need me ? Why can 't you just get him ? I understand you work for a federally funded programme , teaching on various reservations . Is that true ? – Yes , that 's true . – Well , I 'd think you 'd be eager to help us . We 're on the same team . Now they 're letting her go . ( sighs ) – Hey . – Hey . – Thanks for the note . – Sure . – Did you have a nice walk ? – I did . You know , it 's really beautiful here . Oh , um , I have a present for you . Oh , thanks . I ... I need that . Yeah . Is something wrong ? Oh , no , no . I 'm fine . Now , why don 't you go wash up ? I 'll make us breakfast . – OK . – OK . 45 seconds . A minute 30 . And ... that 's two . – Looks good . – You think so ? – Thank you . – Mm-hm . Don 't drink that . It 's drugged . Oh , God . I don 't know what I 'm doing . I have no idea what I 'm doing . Some federal agent came up to me and said you were a delusional sociopath , and showed me this tape . So maybe you are . But I don 't want to believe that . I don 't think I can . And she also said that if you ran , they would shoot you , so I should drug you instead . Even if what they said is true , I don 't want you to die . I don 't want you to die . Cris , is it true ? Oh , shit ! ( distorted TV commentary ) Get me noise reduction . I don 't like hearing this . Speak quietly , and act normally . How long did they say the drugs would take ? Um , about five minutes . – What is he doing ? – He 's drinking . Give it a minute . Got a clean shot ? Not yet . The man in that casino would have killed two people . It happened . It just hadn 't happened yet . Oh , my God . You are delusional . Fluffy cranberry or chocolate-chip pancakes for the kids . ( TV ) Fluffy cranberry or chocolate-chip pancakes for the kids . Safe ? I know a man who dropped dead from looking at his wife . ( TV ) Safe ? I know a man who Dropped dead from looking at his wife . You can 't get lost in the woods if you never go into the woods . ( TV ) You can 't get lost in the woods if you never go into the woods . That 's right , sir . You are the only person authorised to do so . ( TV ) That 's right , sir . You are the only person authorised to do so . – How are you doing this ? – I have no idea how , but I can . I was born with it . – Is this some kind of a trick ? – You know we don 't have time for that . You said anything was possible . So , you see things before they happen ? – You see the future . – My future . What will affect me , and only two minutes ahead . Except you . For some reason , I saw you ... for some reason I saw you beyond anything I 'd seen before , and I don 't know why . What do you mean , you " saw " me ? You 've been ... you 've been doing that to me ? You know what I 'm gonna do and say ? You 've just been setting me up ? No , I haven 't . I wanted to find you because I needed to know why I was seeing you , and because I ... I ... It wasn 't a setup . ( sighs ) What do they want from you ? They think I can help them on matters of national security . ( voice from TV ) The , uh , go code is received . The normal SSB radios in the aircraft ... I don 't understand . If you can help them , why don 't you ? Because I can 't . I can only give them a two-minute head start , and that 's if my life is personally involved . – But with me you can see further ? – Yeah . But they don 't know that . There 's almost $ 10,000 in this envelope . They know about you . You need to get away from here . What time do you have ? – 9 : 10 . – Set your watch to 9 : 1 7 . Read this when I leave and wait exactly 45 seconds before you do what it says . I 'll take Ferris with me . It might be a week or a month , but if you can wait , I 'll find you . Oh . Something 's wrong . Don 't do it . I already have . Go get him – alive ! ( man ) Let 's go ! Pitchku mat ! Cris ? ( man ) Oh , shit ! Go ! Get the fuck ... ! – ( woman ) Heads up ! – ( man ) Look out ! Johnson . You know you 're not gonna shoot . You 're going to let me die ? ( siren wails ) ( Callie ) Hey ! Hey , I need some help ! Let 's get him out of here ! – Let 's get him out of here . – ( Cavanaugh ) I got him . Are you all right ? Are you OK ? Open your eyes . Look at me . No good deed goes unpunished , does it ? – She got him . – Now what ? ( dials phone ) – ( man ) Can you see her ? – ( man # 2 ) C 'est bon . Je l 'ai sur la route . Smoke ? Thanks for today . You could have let me die . I appreciate it . That was a real show of character . I know I seem like the bad guy in all of this , but in the interests of preserving our freedom , there are larger issues at play . What about my freedom ? With freedom comes responsibility . I ... have rights . This isn 't about you , this is about eight million other people . If I do what you want , you 'll keep me in this chair forever . There is a nuclear bomb somewhere in Los Angeles , and every television station in the world will broadcast the details of its detonation . So , go on , push that two minutes as far as you can , and find it . ( TV ) The system , a tropical storm , is picking up steam and heading for the US . Experts fear it has a chance of growing to an F3 status before making landfall . More worrisome is the possibility it could travel through what is known as " Hurricane Alley " into the Gulf of Mexico . The warm waters would cause the storm to intensify quickly . Evacuation plans are already in place in most coastal cities and watches and warnings will be posted as the National Weather Service ... ( man on TV ) We 're interrupting your broadcast for breaking news out of Los Angeles ... Most of the largest technology corporations oppose this idea , and tech lobbying is blamed for stalling the rate structure . ... and members of the LAPD bomb squad are staging in that area . We go live now to reporter Lisa Joyner at the scene for the very latest . Jeff , the standoff began when police received a phone call stating that explosives would be detonated at this parking garage at Second and Broadway at six o 'clock tonight . There 's no ... Uh , they have no idea on a motive . The victim , however ... – Liz , I 'm sorry . – What ? What did you say ? ... the LAPD have secured a perimeter . But now the bomb squad is making their way onto the deck of this building and they 're the men walking up with black suits on and such . ( gasps for breath ) Oh , my God ! Uh , th ... there 's been ... there 's been an explosion . There 's been an explosion ... Uh ... Oh , my God ! Um ... The victim has been identified as Elizabeth Cooper , and , uh , she was , uh , strapped to a , uh , wheelchair ... Um ... Sorry ? Approximately 10 % of US workers receive stock options . Many technology companies ... – Tell me what just happened . – I can 't . It won 't work like this . Just get me out of this room and I 'll do what you want . I beg you , please get me out of this room . ( breathes heavily ) Let him out . – Callie , Callie , wait up . – What ? Forensics report on Betty Peterson , the girl in the apartment . Her throat was cut , bled out . No DNA . The place was immaculate again . – How did it go with Johnson ? – He 's not sharing . – There are traces of potassium iodide . – Medication ? They found a pillbox . No . The only reason to take it is to prevent radiation poisoning . Hey . Can I get a smoke or something ? I need to relax . Thanks . Hey , can I get a light ? Look at this . Look . Ta-da ! ( alarm ) Get it up here ! Let 's go ! ( man ) Base , Air One . Base , Air One . I 've got visual . Subject is spotted heading south on Fifth Street . ( over radio ) Be advised , turning east onto Broadway . Stay here . Let me deal with this . Why are you here ? They killed her . Two hours from now . They killed Liz . Tell me what you saw .

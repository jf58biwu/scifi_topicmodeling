 [ Maddux Narrating ] P.N.R. - point of no return . It sounds simple . You step across the line and you focus only on the way ahead . No going back . Sounds like a good way to live life . Look only ahead . Put the bad stuffbehind you and move on . But that 's impossible . Your past always finds you . [ Zoe ] Donner ? Even when you think you 've let it go . Everything okay ? Yeah . During the days of the Roman Republic ... crossing the Rubicon River with an army was considered an act of war . In 49 B.C. , Julius Caesar ignored that law . He made the choice to cross the river , leading to civil war ... the end of the Republic and his own deification . I 'd say Caesar won . Thank you , Nadia . Gracias . Once we pass our own Rubicon point ... we 'll no longer be able to do a direct abort ... and return quickly to Earth . This is our last chance to take a shortcut home ... instead of having to go all the way around Venus . And we 're pretty far away from home right now . Almost 30 million kilometers . Do you see Earth way up to the left ... at about 1 . 1 : 00 ? Very soon it will look like ... just another star in the night sky . I really think we should tell them about Beta now . I know this group . They need some time to process . There are larger issues at play here . This call 's not up to you . - It 's not even up to me . - But I don 't want to lie to them . This isn 't about what any of us want . This is about what we have to do . [ Groans ] Ted . Roger that . Good night . [ Ted ] Donner and Nadia . We need a nominal for every system before we can pass Rubicon ... tonight at 1900 . About 30 systems are coming up as off nominal . Probably just needs a reboot . But you get to check it anyway . - Lucky us . - And we will be assembling ... a time capsule . - Aw , you gotta be kidding me . - Time capsule ? On our last mission to Mars , at Rubicon ... Goss had each of us pick an object , something personal . And we put them all in a time capsule . And we left it behind . We have to leave something ? I just don 't think I have anything I can get rid of . Just put a pair of your undies in , Morales . - That is not funny . - Well , it 's a little funny . It 's just that everything I have is important to me . It 's supposed to be important to you , Morales . That 's why you 're leaving it behind . You know , Mars mission 's not exactly a time of my life I 'm looking to relive . Well , this time capsule isn 't about Mars , Donner . It 's about unity . It 's about mutual sacrifice . It 's about anything that brings us closer . - Make it easier to deal with challenges down the line . - Okay . - And you believe that ? - Yes , I do . Well , I didn 't bring anything to put in it . [ Scoffs ] Oh , yes , you did . This is Rufus . Okay . What 's a Rufus ? It 's our space baby . Or at least he will be . Right now it 's a 21.-day-old rabbit embryo . Rufus , say hello to your dad . [ Clears Throat ] Jen , what are you doing ? You know you 're not supposed to keep those embryos past a couple of days . - It 's just with this one . - Jen , you cannot have a full-grown rabbit on the ship . - You know you 're just gonna have to kill it . - I know . I know . L - I just - I wanted to keep one for a little while . I mean , aren 't you a little bit happy ? Babies are supposed to make everyone happy . It 's a 21 - day-old rabbit embryo . It 's not a baby . Oh , okay . You know what ? Um , I never showed him to you . - Jen . - No , it 's fine . It 's fine . I 'm fine . I just - Forget I even brought it up . Bye , babe . [ Clears Throat ] Storage Bay 7 pressurization system . - [ Beeps ] - Rebooting . Pressurization system is now nominal . Everything should be that easy . Uh , accelerometer assembly system . - [ Beeps ] - Nominal . Microwave scan beam . - [ Beeps ] - Nominal . Okay . Uh , how about I take the ones over here ... and you take the ones over there ? Brayton turbines . Why is this a problem for you ? The Brayton turbines ? Before we left , things were good . I think they 're still good . I think we 're gonna be a go . Not this . This . I like being friends with benefits . Why are things different up here than they were down there ? Because they just are . Is this about Zoe ? No . No . Because it was about Zoe last time . This has nothing to do with Zoe . Look , we 're not training anymore . I don 't want to complicate this mission . This mission ? This is about Sharon . It was 10 years ago , Donner . Let it go . - Is it weird for you ? - Lot of things are weird for me . What 'd you have in mind ? Goss ranking everyone who might get to go on the mission , ASCANs and instructors . - Uh-huh . - You nervous ? - I don 't get nervous . - Confidence . I like that . How about a wager ? I 'm ranked higher than you , you sleep with me . If you are ranked higher than me , I 'll sleep with you . [ Chuckles ] Uh , I don 't date astronauts . - Mmm , you should reconsider . - Yeah ? - I have a lot to offer . - Like what ? - One , no emotional attachment . - Uh-huh . Two , no expectations . I don 't care if we have a future . I don 't care if you call me the next day . And I really don 't care if you ever buy me dinner . But I like dinner . [ Beeps ] Don 't get too comfortable being on top , Schilling . I love being on top . Looks like I win . I vote my place . Damn it . I 'm not top eight . 28th ? Seriously ? 28th . Four better than me . Dead last . [ Inhales Deeply ] Give me the belt . Yeah . - Way to go , bud . - Thanks . Okay . Don 't worry about it . It 's only the first one , right ? It 'll get better . And you have that thing to deal with , you know ? The thing . The , uh , extenuating circumstances . Twenty-eighth is not extenuating circumstances . Twenty-eighth is , um - Twenty-eighth is I 'm gonna end up teaching high school geology . Twelfth and thirteenth ? It 's Goss . - [ Chattering ] - I stood on Mars . - Excuse me ? - I 'm just putting that out there among colleagues ... that I 've stood on Mars . - I know . I was there . - No , no , no . Let 's be clear . I was on Mars . He was on Mars . You were safe up on Zeus issuing commands . That 's ' cause I was the commander of the ship . You seriously expect me to believe that I 'm 12th ? I might have tolerated second because Ted Shaw 's a hell of an astronaut . But 12th ? - Donner , it 's just a preliminary - - I 've stood on Mars . You 're handicapping us because of something that happened five years ago ... that we were all responsible for . - You 're right . - I 'm what ? You 're right . I am handicapping you two . I don 't want you guys on this mission . In fact , I don 't want you anywhere near my ship . You got baggage , Donner . - Baggage kills people . - No . Thinking you 're infallible kills people that didn 't have to die . I knew exactly what I was doing . And I can live with that . - Can you really ? - Yeah , I can . Come on , babe . It 's not worth it . You got something else , Donner ? Come on . [ Man Singing Rock ] ? So you got dumped on your rump ? ? Not surprised you had nothing to say ? ? To your friends the night before your birthday ? You have the 10-minute rule in Germany ? It 's awesome . If Donner isn 't here in two more minutes , we all get to leave . - [ Maddux ] Okay . - Oh , come on . - Today we 're gonna be looking at Antares 's flight system . - ? Now people stare ? Except some idiot posted the schematic for the lab module . - Um - - ? Moved on , found another and it leaves no question ? - ? She cries to her friends just to get attention ? - [ Sighs ] - All right . Um - - ? She puts you down ? It 's gonna be a general overview today . Those of you who don 't wash out will have the privilege of learning all about it later . ? This is , this is , this is a sticky situation ? - Wrong . That 's wrong . - ? This is , this is , this is a sticky situation ? - ? This is , this is , this is a sticky situation ? - Wrong . That 's wrong . ? You know that she wants you and you don 't want her anymore ? ? This is , this is , this is this is , this is , this is a sticky situation ? - Wrong . - ? You know that he wants you ? - ? And you don 't want him anymore ? - No . - ? This is , this is , this is a sticky situation ? - Damn it ! [ Airplane Passes Overhead ] I 've just never done anything illegal , like ever . I follow rules . I am - I am a rule follower . Well , uh , don 't worry . The market for keeping these things under wraps is pretty big . Tell me about the risks with the pill . Give me odds . Well , in clinical trials in Europe , one in a thousand women had difficulties . Those are pretty good odds . So that 's what I recommend to you . I , uh - I 'm not sure what I 'm gonna do yet . Well , I understand . It 's a difficult decision . So I 'll leave you my card . You decide that you want to move forward , then you give me a call . - All right . - Okay . Good luck . [ Doorbell Rings ] Your father has left me . - What ? - Your father has left me . - Dad has not left you . - I should 've seen this coming . Mercury was in retrograde when we got married . Mom , I don 't have time for the crazy thing you do every time Dad goes on a dig , all right ? - I 'm in the middle of training . - Oh , it 's not just a dig . He left for good . See ? Here 's the note . Do you have anything to drink ? [ Phone Clatters On Table ] - And since when did you start eating ice cream ? - I 've always eaten ice cream . Not by the bucket . And only when you have the flu . You don 't have the flu , do you ? Maybe you could sneeze on your note-leaving father . Dad always leaves a note . He doesn 't believe in saying good-bye . And you are overreacting like you always do . I 'm overreacting because this time there 's someone else . Oh , there 's someone else . A field assistant not much older than you are . Huh . What are you gonna do ? I have no idea . Moving on to water filtration system . - [ Beeps ] - How we doing ? - Off nominal . - Really ? Mm-hmm . It didn 't clear on reboot . Let me see that . [ Sighs ] [ Beeping ] Huh . How long till Rubicon ? Four hours , 17 minutes . Okay . Keep going . [ Ted ] Any idea what 's going on ? [ Maddux ] Oh , it could be anything . The first four panels are nominal . If we can find it , it should be easy to fix . - Rubicon 's in four hours . - Roger that . [ Ted ] All 's green and nominal . I 'll start down here . You okay ? You 're being quiet . You 're never quiet . Rollie and I kinda had a fight this morning . What ? You and Rollie never fight . It 's just that ... his longest mission was 34 days . And I 'm facing six years . And he 's judging me . For what ? Nothing . [ Sighs ] It 's nothing . It 's - It 's just he doesn 't understand what it 's like to be alone up here . You know , he doesn 't get it . [ Tapping Keypad ] [ Beeping ] [ Beeps ] I just want to see where you spend your time . Is that so bad ? I won 't even say I 'm your mother . You could introduce me as Bev Kennedy . It 'll be fun . Like we 're friends . In fact , do that . - Maybe I can meet a hot astronaut . - Ew . Hi . I 'm Bev Kennedy . Zoe 's friend . Two gin martinis , very dry , three olives . You got it . - [ People Chattering ] - [ Pool Balls Clacking ] And before you start , I don 't want to talk about your father or his stupid field assistant . I want to focus on you . Oh , let me do a reading . - You just carry them around with you now ? - Yeah . Mom , could you please put those away ? People I work with , they come in here . It 's not like you ever tell me anything about your life . - How else am I gonna know if you 're dating anyone ? - I 'm not dating anyone . Well , why not ? You 're a lovely girl ... when you put makeup on . - Nice cards . - My mother was raised by Gypsies . - She used to be fun . - [ Laughs ] All they 'll tell you is that I am 28th in the program , never gonna make the ship ... and I should clearly just quit and get a research grant at some state university . Oh , don 't be ridiculous . At least go for an Ivy League school . Do you even listen when I talk ? - Why are you here ? - To have a drink with my daughter . - No , no , no . Why are you here here ? - I just wanted - - To wreak havoc in my life , like you always do when Dad leaves ? Seriously , Bev . It 's enough . Oh ! The Falling Tower . Oh ! I 'm leaving . - You 're making me dinner ? - Yes , I am . - Hi . - Hey , brother . - So have you thought about when you 're coming over ? - I have not . - Oh , you lie . - Okay . - I 've thought about it a couple times . - And ? Well , tempting as it might be , you 're still an astronaut . I don 't date astronauts . Technically , you don 't date astronauts anymore . Technically , that 's true . Technically , my top lock sticks . So you kind of have to jimmy the door a little and then pull ... hard . Lee , do we have access to the I.S.O. Archives ? We have unrestricted access to pretty much everything . Listen , I want the Mars mission . Cockpit recordings , telemetrics , the works . Copy . [ Beeps ] [ Mike ] Calliope , this is Zeus . We 're showing that the dust is breaching your thruster controls . This storm 's on the rise . We 're losing your launch window . [ Maddux ] Copy that , Zeus . Yeah , it 's looking bad down here . - How far out are they ? - One hundred meters . We 're holding . [ Eve ] The real feed never went to pixel . It was edited . The official statement says the transmission was cut off because of the storm . Well , obviously not . Turn up the volume on " B. " - [ Maddux ] Just give ' em two minutes , Mike . - You don 't have two minutes . - Well , we 're gonna take our chances . - Not on my watch . You will die , the mission will fail . I need that lander off the planet now , Donner . - Open the damn valve . - Sharon ? - Donner , launch ! - [ Maddux ] Sharon ? - [ Computer Voice ] Launch now . - They could 've made it . - [ Maddux ] Sharon ? - [ Mike ] Open the damn valve , Donner ! - [ Maddux ] God forgive me . - [ Rocket Ignites ] Who signed off on the editing and the press release ? Goss ? Yeah . It was Goss and someone else . We 've got two clearances here . The second one 's E7 . What 's E7 ? The National Security Council . [ Ted ] Everything okay ? - Think we missed something ? - Apparently not . Listen . Hypothetically , if somebody were to tell you ... that they 're having , uh - I don 't know - hallucinations or something ... what do you do ? - Hallucinations ? - Yeah . Well , hypothetically , I 'd have to report them to Mission Control ... and recommend they have a serious psych evaluation ... and bar them from any E. V.A. Activity ... or landings . Okay . Good to know . - [ Whispering ] - [ Footsteps Approach ] [ Wass ] Oh , that is classic . Excuse me ? Well , is that really all you have ? A bunch of religious crap ? Send it all into space . I wouldn 't expect you to understand . Well , I don 't know , Morales . I 'm just saying . Your faith must be wavering if you need all that crap to prove it . - Mmm . - Mmm . [ Panting ] - Hey . - Hi . You know , I was just thinking that , um , we never actually got to talk about your paper . So I wanted to let you know that the offer 's still open if you 're interested . Drink ? Cyanobacteria ? Come on . Tell me you 're at least a little tempted . It 's just - [ Sighs ] L - I can 't . - Okay . Can I ask why ? - Um - Well , it 's just that by " drink , " I think you kind of mean " date . " And I kind of am seeing Ted now . And it 's just - Ted 's a friend . When I say " drink , " I really meant drink . Look , if I were ever to ask you out on a date , you would know . - I 'm such an ass . I 'm so sorry , Rol . - No . No , no , no , no . It 's all right . Maybe that didn 't come out right . You know what ? Let 's - Let 's just start this again . I 'd like to ask you some questions about your paper on cyanobacteria . Can I buy you a drink ? Well , just so happens those are two of my favorite things . Take a draft , Tommy . [ People Chattering ] ? [ Country On Speakers ] You 're Maddux Donner . - Yes , I am . - You left two people on Mars . - That 's the one . - My daughter 's in the space program . She 's very smart . Zoe Barnes . Do you know her ? Yes , I do . Are you Zoe 's mom ? Bev Barnes . Nice to meet ya . Next drink 's on me . Nice to meet you . Zoe didn 't even tell me that she met you . - That 's what every guy wants to hear . - Oh , don 't take it personally . She never tells me anything . I 'm sure it would 've shown up in her cards , but she never indulges me . - Mm-hmm . - Would you like me to read you ? - Sure . If it doesn 't involve money or pain . - Excellent . Zoe 's thinking about leaving the program to look for a research grant at an Ivy League school . Really ? Why ? I don 't know . Something about the number 28 and a ship . I think she 's being ridiculous . - You got your question ? - Yeah . Go ahead . Cut . - Ah , the Lover . - Mmm . Well , you 'll have at least one very important love affair in your life . Possibly two . It 's not clear . She really said she 's leaving , huh ? Well , she said she 's considering it . The Fool with Star . Hmm . - What 's that ? - You 're a man haunted by your past . Not that that 's surprising , given your past . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Exhales ] My cheating husband . Excuse me . No , it 's just l - I 've always been so fascinated ... with marine life , you know ? And I see these pictures ... of what the Great Barrier Reef looked like when it was still underwater . I can 't help but wonder - Wonder if the effects of global warming were directly responsible ... for the death of cyanobacteria , and ultimately the death ... of the Great Barrier Reef . Wow . You really have read my paper . That 's impressive , sir . I also read your follow-up when you talk about ... the reintroduction of cyanobacteria into the rice paddies in Asia . Help promote the growth of rice , and hopefully , uh ... help alleviate the world food shortage . It 's very interesting . Okay . Um , I 'm slightly terrified right now 'cause that 's bordering on stalker . But seriously , I mean , they 've been trying to put that into play for 50 years now . Yeah , well , I guess it 's just your dumb luck there 's someone else here who actually cares ... - about what 's going on with the Earth . - Hmm . - We might be the only two . - Hmm . Well , then here 's to you and me , baby . - [ Ted ] Hey , babe . - Hi . - Ready for dinner ? - Hey , my man . - Hey , brother . - How you doing ? Thank you so much for the drink . And the cyanobacteria . You 're welcome . Thoughts on cyanobacteria and the rice paddies in Asia ? - Say nothing . - I think she 's beautiful . Well , that 's not bad . But anyway . Have a good night . - You guys have a good dinner . - [ Both ] Good night . Found this somewhere . - Thank you . - Actually , I was in the back of the class . - I had to duck . - Yeah . It got away from me . Sorry about that . Anger will do that , and frustration , guilt . - It 's not just a baseball , is it ? - Mintz , don 't shrink me . Look , I 'm just saying , if the story 's true ... that 's a lot to carry around . What story 's that ? Two astronauts are secretly dating . They go to a baseball game ... a couple nights before their Mars mission launch . He catches a home run ball and he gives it to her . Her prized possession . She takes it to Mars and she doesn 't make it back . From that moment on , he can 't put that ball down . Maybe I got it wrong . Yeah , you did . Sharon caught the ball ... barehanded . [ Knocks ] Ms. Lewis ? Maddux ? We agreed you wouldn 't come here again . I know we did . I 'm - I 'm , uh - I 'm sorry . It won 't happen again . Uh - I have a confession to make . Um - When we got back from Mars , I - I took this ... from , uh , your daughter 's things ... before they had a chance to pack ' em up and send ' em to you . I didn 't have any right to do that . I 'm sorry . This belongs to you . And , uh , I think - I think you ought to have it . What makes you think that I would want that , Maddux ? I don 't know . It-It was Sharon 's . And , um ... I know it meant something to her . Well , it means nothing to me . Good night , Ms. Lewis . Where have you been ? Your father called . - I 'm going to meet him on the dig . - Uh-huh . What about " someone else " ? - What ? - Mother . Okay , okay . I might have overreacted . You okay , Zoe ? You look a little lost . - You sure you don 't want me to - - Okay . Okay ? Really ? - Okay as in " yes ? " - Don 't make me say it again . I might come to my senses . So you 're pregnant . The Hanged Man told you that ? No . Your boobs are huge , two tubs of Rocky Road ... and you haven 't had anything to drink since I got here . What are you gonna do ? I don 't know . [ Ted ] This one is nominal too . They 're all good . Well , that makes no sense . [ Sighs ] All right . Let 's check ' em again . Has it occurred to you that everything 's gone wrong with this mission ? - [ Locks Hissing ] - Wrenches , filtration systems . Antares was in orbit for a year of testing before we left . Maybe it 's us . - Yeah . Well , maybe it is . - I was kidding . You know , Donner , we weren 't even supposed to be here dealing with this . We 're supposed to be on Earth . You 're supposed to be irritating Goss ... and I 'm supposed to be reading Goodnight , Moon to my son ... and sleeping in bed with my wife . Everything has gone wrong with this mission from the start . And maybe it 's time we said enough is enough . Are you saying you don 't want to do the check ? You just want to turn the thing around and go home ? - No . - Well , it kind of sounds to me like that 's what you 're saying . Ted , what 's going on ? Do you know something I don 't know ? No , not a thing . Let 's just check ' em again . [ Knocks ] Wow . - What are you doing here ? - What 's this I hear about you leaving ? What ? Bev tells me that you 're thinking about leaving the program . - Bev should not talk to strangers . - I 'm not a stranger . Bev gave me a reading - which was actually kind of accurate . Perfect . How do you even think about leaving ? I don 't think I 'm gonna have much choice in the matter . You did see I was 28 . Come on . That 's , like , a preliminary ranking . That 's not anything . Yeah . You ever think about ... living a different life ? What do you mean ? Like what ? Like a regular job and a family . Yeah . Yeah . Someday . I mean , right now , more than anything , I just want to fly . Don 't you ? Yeah . - Don 't leave . - Why ? You 're gonna be a good astronaut . Good night , Donner . All right . What now , engineer ? Humor me a second . [ Locks Hissing ] It 's number five . The instrument panel says it 's clean . - Run a sample check . This is definitely off nominal . - Donner , you 're reaching . Let 's just run the sample . [ Beeps ] Look at the pH . The sensor must be out . Probably ruined the carbon scrubs . - We would 've been screwed . - Yeah . Now you know there 's no way to judge pH by just looking at something . Well , it 's just lucky then , I guess . - [ Beeping ] - [ Computer Voice ] Message waiting . - [ Beeping ] - [ Computer Voice ] Message waiting . Hey , Jenny . I guess you must be busy . I just wanted to say that , um ... I 'm sorry about this morning . And I don 't want to fight with you . No , I don 't get it . I just - I just want to talk to you , let you explain it to me . In the meantime , um - [ Clears Throat ] Tell Rufus that Daddy says hello . And I wish I were there with both of you . [ Beeps ] [ Man ] ? The tide is high ? ? I 've never been so low ? ? You got room to grow ? ? You can never look up ? ? You can 't ever look down ? ? You get kicked around ? ? But I 've built it with sand ? ? And I built it with rock ? ? I 've built it with all of the things that I 'm not ? ? And I watch from the hill as it burns to the ground ? ? I can still see the smoke ? ? From my train out of town ? ? Everything I build is breaking down ? ? Everything I build ? ? Is breaking down ? Rubicon in five ... four , three ... two , one . ? Scared of what I saw ? ? Are you mad at all ? [ Rollie ] Godspeed , Antares . - Godspeed . - ? Been an open book ? ? Been a slammed door ? Doesn 't even look like Earth anymore . ? Apple of the Trojan War ? [ Eve ] Mike , I need to talk to you . - I got a board dinner . - I 've seen the Mars recordings . Both of them . My clearance actually exceeds the N.S.C. If you 've seen both recordings , then you know I did my duty as commander . I 've seen the whole file , Mike . Including the telemetry . It shows that Lewis and Walker didn 't stop . And Donner and Shaw didn 't panic . You did . - You 're out of line . - We both know I 'm not . We both know I had a damn good reason for wanting them off that planet . I want you off their backs , Mike . And whatever personal animosity you have towards them , let it go . ? But I built it with sand ? [ Maddux Narrating ] Passing the point of no return doesn 'tjust happen . It 's a choice that we make . A line we decide to cross . And then we live with the consequences . ? As it burns to the ground ? Eve , I don 't care what he says . There is no way he knew the pH was off in that tank . And he was talking about hallucinations earlier today . - And what did you tell him ? - Nothing . Which was the wrong thing to do . But I told him nothing . We 're all doing what 's necessary , Ted . Yeah . Well , we 'll see what tomorrow brings . [ Maddux Narrating ] There are no promises of a positive outcome . No guarantees that , like Caesar , we 'll wind up with an empire . They feel a lot farther away today than they did yesterday . Don 't they ? ? Been an open book ? [ Maddux Narrating ] All we can really count on is that things will change . And that we 'll have to live with the results . [ Ted ] Hey , madman . You know , you got me thinking yesterday . And I realized that this time capsule is actually about ... being willing to let something go ... than having to . So you all get your stuffback . It 's not the way Goss did it . Do I look like Goss to you ? It 's a different mission . Remember that . ? I can still see the smoke ? ? From my train out of town ? [ Maddux Narrating ] And that 's the hard part ... because we 're defined by our past . ? Everything I build ? ? Is breaking down ? - [ Automatic Gunfire ] - [ Girl Shouts ] ? I close my eyes ? ? Scared of what I saw ? [ Maddux Narrating ] We can rethink our choices a million times . ? Are you mad at all ? - But what we decide , we own . - ? Been an open book ? ? Been a slammed door ? It becomes a part of who we are . ? Apple of the Trojan War ? [ Beeps ] ? But I built it with sand ? ? And I built it with rock ? ? I built it with all of the things that I 'm not ? ? And I watch from the hill ? ? As it burns to the ground ? ? I can still see the smoke ? ? From my train out of town ? [ Maddux Narrating ] And while we may be crossing the river - ? Everything I build is breaking down ? ? Everything I build is breaking ? ? Everything I build is breaking down ? Our footprints will always remain on the other side . ? Everything I build is breaking down ? Mmm . Ahh . English - US - SDH

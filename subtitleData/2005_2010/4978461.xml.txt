 Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race . The 21st century is when everything changes ... and Torchwood is ready . He 's dead . Sorry , we 're closing . Excuse me , ma 'am . Documents on the body identify the victim as Meredith Roberts . No obvious signs of violence . Are we saying it wasn 't the Weevil ? Give me a chance , Miss Cooper . I 've only just started . ' Jack , your VIP visitor is here . ' I didn 't realise we were having a visitor . Suddenly , in an underground mortuary , on a wet night in Cardiff , I hear the song of a nightingale . Miss Martha Jones . Oh , it 's good to see you , Jack . Toshiko , Owen , Gwen , Ianto , meet Martha . Just a casual visit or ... ? I 'm here to complete your postmortem . Dr Jones is from UNIT . Oh , I 'm sorry , sorry , I get a bit confused . Which one 's UNIT ? Intelligence , military , cute red caps . The acceptable face of intelligence gathering on aliens . We 're more ad hoc . But better looking . I identified a pattern from UNIT 's data on sudden deaths . Toxic shock . Nothing to link the victims . Different ages , sexes , ethnic origins , occupations . But there was a statistically significant concentration in South Wales . Come on , Martha , be honest . You just came all this way to see me . Still struggling to conquer your shyness , Jack ? So what about this pattern , then , Dr Jones ? They were being written off as suicides or accidents . Look . Puncture mark . Hypodermic needle . You 'll find his bloodstream was pumped full of ammonium hydroxide . Bloodstream . I was going to do that next . Have you checked his medical records ? No . I wasjust about to . Let 's give it a go . You never know , Owen , you might learn something . One Meredith Roberts , age 45 . I know there 's been a major crash on the NHS system . Wiped a shedload of files . Including all the victims I flagged up from the UNIT data . And now yours . A computer crash wouldn 't delete data so cleanly . This is deliberate . Let me look into it . How 's the family ? Getting better . They send their love . Give them mine . So , End of the World Survivors Club . God , I am so glad to see you , Jack ! See , you did come all this way just to see me . It 's the jaw line . Once seen , always yearned for . D 'you miss him ? No . I made my choice . Maybe sometimes . Ah ! Tiny bit . Tiny , tiny . Then I come to my senses again . Anyway , I 've got plenty to occupy me . Oh , yeah , Miss Highfalutin ' . What is it ? Medical officer ? Oh , yes . So do I have to call you ma 'am ? No . Just follow my orders to the letter . You should have called me if you were looking for a job . I wasn 't . This woman from UNIT rang out of the blue , said I was just what they needed , that I 'd come highly recommended by an impeccable source . You mean ... ? Well , who else would have done it ? He must have thought he owed you a favour . Guess we all do . Do you think you could get me one of those white caps for personal use ? Ianto might look good in it . You want uniforms , get your own . Now , am I going to get the guided tour ? Yes , ma 'am , whatever you say , ma 'am ! Huah ! Leave it ! So that 's the hot house . Tour continues this way , ladies , please . No dawdling . Um , so , you know Jack pretty well , then ? Oh , we were only together for ... a few days . But it was pretty intense . You mean ... ? Oh , God , no ! No , not that sort of intense . Nothing like that . Why ? Are you and him ... ? No , no , not at all . We must be the only two people on the planet . I know . What are we doing wrong ? Oi , you talking about me ? No , no , we were just discussing alien flora , weren 't we ? Oh , yeah . She 's no fun . Raise your game , girls ! You 've got some well weird kit . What 's this ? Be careful . It 's an alien artefact . There 's a lot of argument about this . But for my money , it 's got to be a surgical instrument . Really ? He 's guessing . Typical medic . Hmm . Well , I call it a singularity scalpel . See , what it does is concentrates energy on a tiny fixed point without damaging anything on the way . It 's brilliant . It 's amazing . Yeah , do you remember the last time you did that , Owen ... ? Yes . Right , now , all we 're going to do is , we 're going to vaporise this paper without even scorching the cup . This is going to end in tears . OK . Aagh ! Er , haven 't quite got the calibration right yet . Jack , there 's been another attack . Assault with a hypodermic . Only this time , the victim survived . Woman , aged 27 . She 's in the hospital . Medical records wiped , just like the others . Yeah , but the doctors said they 'd finished with me . We 're a bit different . We know this is tough on you , Marie . But did you recognise the man who attacked you ? I already told the police . We 're different from them , too . No , I never seen him before . Did he say anything in the course of the attack ? No . Open wide . Look , he just , he came towards me with a great big bloody needle , didn 't he ? You know , my dog bit him and then I kicked him in the nuts . Respect ! " Feel Good Inc " by Gorillaz This is a ... three four . So you and Jack go back a long way ? Forward and back , really . What brought you together ? Let 's say we were under the same doctor . These killings - why the ammonium hydroxide ? It 's a weird way to kill someone . Yeah , it 's gross . It 's like injecting them with bleach . Unless the objective isn 't just killing . It 's destroying something in the victim 's bloodstream . It 's getting rid of evidence ! Locally , we 've got a murder victim and a survivor . Both attacked with hypodermics , both with their medical records wiped . And more cases across the UK . We think the point of the attacks is to destroy evidence of their medical condition . Gwen , Ianto , pursue the criminal investigation . OK . Martha , Owen will follow up with the medical side . Fine . Tosh , any luck in retrieving those medical records ? Not yet . I 'm gonna have to dig down into the system memories , see if I can find any remnants of deleted or temporary files . Completely illegally , of course . Do what you have to . We 're not dealing with a freak with some needle fetish . This is a conspiracy . Ianto , the police have found another body in Heath Park . It 's got all the hallmarks of the other attacks . I 'll get Gwen , head out there now . What have you got ? Body was found early this morning . Caucasian male , early 20s . OK , thanks . Who is he ? Barry Leonard . Student . Doctor said it looked like ... Toxic shock . The attack took place in the woods , so no witnesses , no CCTV . Same as the others . Yeah . Tosh just checked Barry 's medical records - already wiped . The puncture mark on his eyeball was identical to the other victims . I mean , Jack 's right . These attacks are not random , they 're clinical . Professional . More like assassinations . Except Barry Leonard was a student . Who 'd assassinate a student ? Student Loans Company . Yeah , yeah , I think you 've just cracked it . But why delete medical records ? You know , what did all these people have in common ? Owen 's analysing Marie 's test results now . So we 've got no idea where the killer will strike next and the attacks are getting more frequent . We keep looking , Gwen , we 'll find something . 'Martha , call from the hospital . 'Marie 's had some sort of seizure . ' They want us at the hospital . Marie 's collapsed . Yeah ? My money 's on this stuff . From Marie 's blood . It 's a new one on me . Yeah , me too . Have you run an isoenzyme analysis on it ? No , not yet . What are you thinking ? Parasitic infection ? Could be . It 's got to be down to this stuff , or I haven 't got a clue what 's wrong with her . Yeah - no infections , no deficiencies in organ function , perfect cholesterol levels , ideal blood pressure . Yeah , exactly . She 's so normal , she 's abnormal . Marie ? Marie , can you hear me ? Mmm , yeah . OK , you 've got something in your blood that we don 't recognise , all right ? We think it 's behind your current illness and we need to know what 's been happening to you so we can help you . Well , you 're the doctors . You tell me . 'Barry was my best mate . We were doing the same course . ' Met him on the first day . Was Barry doing any sort of drugs at all ? Well , he used to be really clean . Reckoned he had to be careful about what went into his body because of his diabetes . Barry was diabetic ? Sure . But when they cured that , he was doing booze , blow ... Wait a minute . You 're telling me Barry 's diabetes was cured ? Sure . That 's impossible . Well , he stopped taking insulin . He was fine . Owen , something you should know . So who performed this miracle cure ? He was very quiet about that . All I know is , he was suddenly flashing a load of wedge about . Barry Leonard is said to have recovered from diabetes . Thanks , Ianto . Listen , Marie , you 're gonna have to level with us . This could be a matter of life and death . Have you ever had a serious medical condition ? Too good to be true . What do you mean ? I had HIV . You 're perfectly clear of antibodies . That 's not medically possible . That 's the Reset . Reset ? What are we talking about ? A drug ? Right , I 'm not familiar with Reset , so any idea of a chemical name ? Where d 'you get it from , Marie ? I got it from the Pharm . The farm ? What farm ? No , P-H-A-R-M , the Pharm . It 's a medical research place , all right ? How did you get it from there ? They gave it to me . They paid me a lot of money . They said I should to keep quiet about it cos it was part of the contract . Are you saying you were a clinical trial subject ? Marie ? Convulsing . Marie ! I 'll give her another 10ml . You 're all right . She 's dead . Emergency ! Get us out of here ! So it 's an alien larva , incubating in human bodies . We 've never seen anything like it . So it left Marie 's body when she died , looking for another host for its next stage of development . Which could have been us . Yeah . Fortunately , when they didn 't find one quickly , they died . I wonder what this cute little larva grows up to be ? This , folks , is a molecular model of the drug that we found in Marie 's blood . She called it Reset . So what does it do ? Think about when you run a virus scan through your computer , yeah ? The software works its way through the files and when it finds a Trojan or a virus or whatever , identifies it and then deletes it . That is what this stuff does to the human body . But it 's not just viruses . It 's harmful bacteria , toxins , even mutant cells , you name it . It 's like the body 's been turned back to its factory settings . It 's the ultimate magic bullet . Supersedes anything and everything in the pharmacological armoury . That would be the greatest medical discovery in history . Exactly . Except , it comes bundled with a lethal alien parasite . Ah , not so good a discovery . The parasite needs a healthy body until it 's incubated . So the parasite egg incorporates this magic bullet , which puts everything in the system back to its factory settings . Reset . Neato . So who runs the Pharm ? Well , the public image is innocent enough . Private-public partnership between the government and a consortium of the pharmaceutical companies . Researching and developing cutting-edge biotechnology . Their IT systems are way more cutting-edge than they need to be . Plus , they 've got seemingly unrestricted security clearance . Which means they 'd have the capability to erase medical records if they wanted to . Exactly . Who runs this outfit ? Institute director is a Dr Aaron Copley . Yeah , I know his work . He 's one of the most respected research scientists in his field . Harvard graduate . Did research at Cambridge . Last job , Harvard Professor of Molecular Pharmacology . Came to the UK to set up the Pharm . Hmm , he 's kinda handsome , too . D 'you think he 'll like visitors ? Torchwood . Sorry you 've had a wasted journey , Mr ... Harker . Harkness . And it 's Captain , but you can call me Jack . Captain ? Where did you park your boat ? I like a man with a sense of humour . Know any good gags about clinical trials ? Well , Jack , none of these faces mean anything to me . And as the institute director , I would have met them personally , had they been our trial subjects . Dr Copley ... Professor , actually . But I can call you Aaron , right ? See , this is a little awkward . Two of these people were murdered . Another died of a parasitic infection of alien origin and one of the victims mentioned your organisation 's name shortly before she died . Alien origin ? That 's preposterous . Er , Professor , when I was writing my MD thesis , your published works on immunology were very helpful , so thank you . Glad to be of service . Now , if there was a drug that could restore the human body back to its factory settings , as it were , you would know about it . You 're right , I would . But nothing like that exists . I had a boyfriend whose nostrils flared when HE was lying . I 'm already late for my next appointment . You go ahead . We 'll have a look around . Well , obviously our research suites are classified , so we can 't grant you access to those , but we 'd be delighted to give you the PR tour . Normally , Aaron , we go where we like . Not here , actually . Ask Whitehall . We 're fireproof . Yeah . I had a bad experience with a politician recently . I tend not to listen to Whitehall any more . Let me get someone to guide you back to your vehicle . Was it me , or was he a little touchy ? Yeah , so much for the polite approach . We need to turn this place over . Oh , yeah . Cos this place has the highest concentration of alien life forms this side of the Rift . Grey is so not her colour . I can 't hack in there , Jack . And if I keep trying a brute-force approach , they 'll know they 're under attack . An alien life form is preying on humans . I need a way in there . Tosh , I 've got the results of that research . On the screen now . Ianto , that 's brilliant ! They 're in the market for volunteers . That 's understandable , given their wastage rate . One of us goes in undercover . No , we don 't know enough about it . Too many things could go wrong . Unless you put a medic in there . Someone who knew what to look for . Yeah , but I can 't do it . They know me now . I know it 's hard to believe , Owen , but I wasn 't thinking of you . No way . Come on , Jack , I 've been in worse places and you know it . OK . Jack , can I have a word ? I know you 're big buddies from way back whenever , but you can 't just send her in like this . Trust me . She 's more than capable . I 'd rely on Martha if the world was ending . In fact , I did . OK , these are the plans for the Pharm 's buildings . From what Jack and Owen saw , they reckon that the main house contains Copley 's office , medical research suites and the accommodation for the clinical trials subjects . What about the rear buildings ? Restricted area , fenced off , armed security . Jack thinks that 's where the readings of alien life forms came from . Cool . But you don 't need to go anywhere near there . Spoilsport . The first thing you need to do is get yourself accepted as a clinical trials subject . Don 't try too hard , don 't draw too much attention to yourself . Be invisible . I can do that . Once you 're in , we need you to gain access to the Pharm 's IT systems , close down the system firewalls and security protocols . Tosh can gain access to the files and see what they 're up to . Industrial espionage . It 's very civilised . Once you 've done that , get out . Don 't take any unnecessary risks . Understood . Cool . So , Jack asked me if I could get you a UNIT cap to wear . Did he ? Well , red is my colour . So am I right in thinking that you and he ... ? We ... dabble . Yeah ? Yeah . So what 's his dabbling like ? Innovative . Really ? Bordering on the avant garde . Wow . Oh , yeah . Huh . So shall we get your cover story sorted ? Absolutely . Fake ID . First name Samantha . Thought the Jones would be safe . OK . How do I stay in touch ? Communication 's very tricky . The whole place could be wired . We don 't want you chattering away to us and being overheard . But I want to monitor you at all times . So ? I don 't need contact lenses . You need these . OK ? Oh , I 'm a camera ! As Chris Isherwood once said to me when we were cruising the Kurfurstendamm . And we ... can ... text . Wow ! Power comes from the body heat , so they only work when you 're wearing them . Yeah , so you have to wear them everywhere . I 'll do some things with my eyes shut , then . In an emergency , we can speak directly to you . The lens will communicate with your sensory neuroreceptors . Bypasses the auditory system . But can 't these signals be intercepted ? Alien technology . Which exploits a solution to the EPR paradox . Oh , quantum entanglement of remote particles . OK , cool . Did I mention she was brilliant ? It 's standard procedure to take two blood tests . One of them will be analysed overnight . Thank you , Nurse . So tell us the places you 've been to , Samantha . Well , I had a great time in North America , France and Germany , Australia ... What about the Third World ? Africa , Latin America ? No , but I 'm sure I 'll get round to it . Travel off the beaten track can be a bit of a problem for us . If you had some exotic tropical disease , there could be unexpected side effects , and volunteers ' welfare is our absolute priority . I don 't think there 'll be any problem with that . And I 'm very conscious of health issues . My mum 's a nurse . This is Professor Copley , Samantha . Institute director . Hi , Sam . Nice to meet you . Tell her to get close to Copley . I see you 're a postgraduate student at the moment . - That 's right . - Studying what ? - Creative writing . So I really need the cash . I 'm sure you 'll understand , Samantha , that we have a lot of applicants . Tell her not to lose him . We 'll let you know in due course . - Actually , there 's something I should have told you . - Oh , yes ? It 'll show up in the test results anyway . I did have a hepatitis infection . No , no , no , she 's bullshitting . It 's her way in . I mean , I 'm fine now , but it stays in the blood . Strictly speaking , it 's incurable , right ? That puts a different complexion on things . We could use a subject with hepatitis . - Are you available to start right now ? - Well , sure . I 've brought my overnight things . Then all we need is your signature on this confidentiality agreement . She 's in . As Chris Isherwood also said , it 's not the getting in , it 's the getting out . - Thank you . - What sort of drugs will you want me to take ? We have got various products at the clinical trials stage . You 'll be given a briefing once we 've finalised the programme , and of course we won 't proceed unless we have your informed consent . Come on , Martha . Let her settle in . It 's gonna be a long night ahead . You and Martha are getting on well . Yeah , you know me - Mr Sociable . She 's beautiful . Is she ? You know she is . Yes , well , fair cop . And a doctor . Perfect match . No , she 's only interested in work . Do you think ? Yeah , a bit of flirting so I 'll show her the ropes . Plus , if I tried anything with her , I think Jack would have my kneecaps . What happened to that , um , pool tournament you were organising ? That ? It was never a tournament . What was all that about , then ? It was supposed to be a date . Sorry ? I was asking you out on a date . A date ? You didn 't realise ? You and me ? Yeah . I see . And ... you still want that ? Yeah . Right . I just thought if we spent some time together , an evening ... All right . Sorry ? Just do it . Are you being sarcastic ? No . You 're being polite . You 'll stand me up . I 've just said yes , haven 't I ? One date , see how it goes , which might be nowhere . That 's fine . A drink . OK . Yeah . I 'm going to keep flirting with people , OK ? Just cos of this , doesn 't mean I 'm going to stop flirting . You can be king of flirts . OK . Right , then . Yeah . Good . We should , er ... concentrate on Martha . Yeah . Tosh , can you get us past this ? Easy peasy . She just needs to get the lenses to within the EPR field . Tosh , can you help her blag her way into the computer system ? It 'll take time to talk her through it . We don 't have time . I want her out of that office . Well , if I can get her to give me remote control of the computer ... .. I have control . The life cycle of the parasite . They call it the Mayfly . Wow . We 've never seen a species like that before . It 's beautiful . It 's lethal . But what is Copley doing with them ? Martha , now we 've got control , we can go through all of this here . Get out of there pronto . Do you have that code-breaker software ? I 'm sending the patch now . Thank you . 'Break out in Zone A. All return to Zone A immediately . 'Breakout in Zone A. Break out in Zone A . ' 'All patrols proceed with extreme caution . 'The escaped creature is extremely dangerous . ' Jack ? I 've got the list of the clinical trials subjects here . Meredith Roberts , Marie Thomas , Barry Leonard . All the murder victims . Ooh , who 's BD ? Executive actions ? The Pharm are running their own hit man , which is unusual for a medical research facility . Wait , there 's a name here that we haven 't seen before . Elin Morgan ? She hasn 't been reported missing or dead . She soon will be . Take Ianto and pull her in . 'Do not attempt to approach the creature , is that understood ? 'Stun and sedate only , the creature is highly dangerous . ' Understood . Come on , keep moving ! If the Pharm have their own hit man , God knows what they 're capable of . Yeah , and I put her in there . Shit ! What was that ? Radiation surge ? We 've lost her signal ! Agh ! Ah ! Agh ! There it is ! Call patrol . Creature located . I can 't get her back . We have to get her out of there . That place is swamped in security . If we steam in , we 'll be putting her at risk ! We can 't leave her there . If I can 't get her signal in 30 minutes , we think of alternatives . Anything could be happening to her . Martha can handle herself . She 's been in worse situations than this . Sure about that ? What 's that ? Billy Davis ' mobile . He 'll be at Elin 's flat in three minutes . Hands above your head ! Up ! Jack , we 've got Billy Davis . He could help get you into the Pharm . Will you tell this gorilla to let me go ? ! What is going on ? ! - Good work . - You can 't treat me like this ! - You lied to us , Samantha . Can I just explain ? I got bored stuck in that room , so I went for a walk , and first that thing attacked me , and then your heavies assaulted me . You don 't owe any loyalty to Torchwood . - Jack Harkness has treated you in a criminally irresponsible way . - Who ? I really don 't understand ! Don 't bother . This is not an interrogation . Torchwood is irrelevant to us , not even a nuisance . In fact , they 've done us quite a favour putting you in here . We 've analysed your test results - you really are something special . Agh ! I got terrible guts , dunno what it is . Bad conscience , Billy . Try confessing . Get stuffed . OK , let 's do it the hard way . Merciful Christ ! What the ... ? Agh-hhh ! They have a tendency to act up . Losing him ! Please ! Something to say , Billy ? Yeah , yeah , whatever you want , just get it away from me ! Get it off me ! OK , Billy , you 've been on a killing spree , why ? I work for the Pharm ! They 'd been giving people this Reset drug . But there were these side effects - parasites or something . They were gonna die anyway , so I had to get rid of them before any weird symptoms showed up ... in public . Do you know what lymphocytes are , Samantha ? A kind of white blood cell , part of the immune system . Well , your lymphocytes are really quite extraordinary . We 've never seen anything like them before , not in a human being . Aliens are a different matter . Aliens ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Your lymphocytes and God knows what other cells have mutated . - Mutated ? How ? - Under the influence of radiation . Radiation that 's not found in the temporally stable environments on Earth . I don 't know what that means . We 've dealt with aliens before , but we have never come across anything as exotic as you . A human being who 's travelled in time and space . Tell me about it . How is that possible ? What did you see out there ? This is mad . I don 't know what you mean . Fine . If that 's the way you want to play it . However it happened , it means you have a uniquely effective immune system , which is what we need . We 're developing a drug that 's going to change the world , Sam . Incurable cancers , AIDS - all the scourges of the human race wiped out . A revolution in medicine and social welfare . Except it 's still imperfect . I 'd like to know what your funky lymphatic system makes of those imperfections . I am not taking that ! But you volunteered . OK , we 're going into the Pharm and you 're going to front it . Yeah , yeah . OK . My stomach ! My stomach ! My stomach ! Agh ! Agh ! Whoa ! Owen , we need him alive ! Yeah , all right , I 'm flying blind here , Jack ! Do something ! Let 's start with this . I think I 've got it , OK ? I 've got the calibrations right . I can get it out of him . Whoa ! God ! Owen , deal with it . Are you sure you had those calibrations right ? I 'm sorry , all right ? He must have breathed in larva when one of his victims died . This could have been me , or Martha . I 've given her twice the critical dose . So , Mayfly larvae are incubating ? Are you sure about this ? Her immune system 's clearly reacting . There 's obviously quite a fight going on inside her . Keep your nerve . We 're making history . Ianto , what have you done with Billy Davis ' body ? Um , I was just about to dispose of it . Why ? I 've thought of a way we can use him to get us into the Pharm . Clever , huh ? Oh , you are warped on the inside . How do you think of these things ? I 'll take that as a compliment . Tosh , Gwen , Ianto , check out Zone A. We 're going after Martha . Let 's go ! Hands above your head ! What have you done to her ? Tell me that 's not Reset ! She 's survived the larval stage , the only subject ever to do so . Fascinating . Turns out these bugs practice sibling cannibalism . Only the strongest individual is left now . God knows what happens next . Put a stop to this ! I can 't . I don 't know how . Put your hands above your head ! Ianto . Bloody hell . Jack , this thing 's killing her . I don 't know what I can do . Owen , stay calm , there has gotta be something . What 's happening here ? This is what the Pharm is all about . We farm captive aliens for the exotic chemical products they metabolise . What the hell do you get from a weevil ? Some pesticides , and a quite powerful chemical defoliant . But the weevils aren 't what 's going to clinch the Nobel for us . The Mayfly , our feedstock for Reset . Given time , we 'll tweak the product for human use , and then it 'll be bigger than penicillin . Jack , I can give you a report on Zone A. They 're holding dozens of creatures . They seem to be using them as test subjects . Understood , Ianto . Tell Tosh to go for total shutdown . This place is a torture chamber . I don 't need to debate medical ethics with you . You abused the Mayflies , you turned them into parasites ! We didn 't understand how the Mayflies reproduced . We tried to limit the damage . What , by murdering people ? They were going to die anyway . We 're on the edge of the greatest discovery in history . It has to be worth a few sacrifices ! You must understand that , Jack , you 're involved in alien research . Not like this . I 'm closing this place down . In your dreams . This is a state of the art , official facility . Oh , I 'm not going to do it by sending a memo . We 're in control of your IT systems . As we speak , we 're crashing your data banks , wiping your records . That 's cyber terrorism ! And that 'sjust for starters . We 're going to trip the systems of your fire , radiation and biohazard safety networks . The power will be cut , sprinklers will be activated , and a large part of this facility will be sealed and flooded with inert gases . The aliens will die . They 're already dying . This way they 'll be put out of their misery . For God 's sake , we 're on the same side ! No . Combating hostile aliens is one thing , but this is slavery , exploitation , a war crime ! Jack , I need your help ! What the hell are you doing ? ! This is the only way we 'll save Martha . I think I understand how it works . You 'd better be sure because it 's never worked before . Owen , are you sure it 's safe ? OK , Jack ! Owen , tell me you 're sure ! You could kill her with that thing ! We 're losing her ! Ah ! What have you done ? Oh , bloody hell , it worked . Thank God for that . Let 's get her out of here . I am prescribing rest and recuperation for you , madam , and a few days in bed , preferably under my supervision . Owen , I don 't know how to break this to you - I 've got a boyfriend . Yeah , but has he saved your life like I did ? Um , yes , actually . Oh . Arms up on there . Do it . 'Facility shut down programme . All personnel must evacuate immediately . 'Facility shut down programme . 'All personnel must evacuate immediately . ' OK , let 's go ! Did you really think I was going to let you just walk away ? You 've ruined everything I 've worked for . Now , let 's not be stupid . OK ? We 're both rational men , scientists . I know you don 't want to shoot . You 're next ! Owen ! Can you hear me , Owen ? ! You 've got to help him ! Owen , stay with me . Owen . Owen , look at me , look at me . Owen , look right at me . Stay with me , Owen , stay with me . Stay with me , buddy . Come on . Owen , speak to me ! He 's dead . Owen ... The time is 21.30 . Autopsy on Owen Harper . Torchwood officer 565 . Aged 27 . Autopsy begins . The energy just went off the scale . Can you see where it is ? You can 't use it . Who knows what 'll happen ! I was hoping for a miracle . Where did he go ? It 's here . Martha ! It must be death , because it 's stolen my life .

 They 're called Fringe Division . FBI Agent Olivia Dunham ... Peter Bishop . His father , Dr. Walter Bishop ... They 're investigating strange cases . Which have led them to Walter 's former lab partner , Dr. William Bell . We have evidence that William Bell may be involved with several biological attacks . The search for Bell has taken them to places beyond the impossible . I will turn this world over looking for him . William Bell is not in this world . I 've been waiting quite a long time for this . - Hello ? - Hello ? GEORGE : 'scuse me . Are you- - are you okay ? COP : It 's car v. car . NYPD 's taking witness statements now . What the hell happened to the drivers ? Hey , you caught the case . So who 's our man ? Who was driving this vehicle ? PETER : Walter , come on . I don 't need you to make me anything . I insist . You know , there 's something you don 't know about me , son . What 's that ? That once you enter a grocery store , you never leave again ? Ever ? No . Before I became chair of biochemistry at Harvard , which was after Oxford and M.I.T. , I was sous chef at the Bakersfield food lab . - Sous chef . - Uh-huh . Well , technically I worked under Seymour Brodien . Am I supposed to know who that is ? He invented the ho-ho . Of course he did . Walter , I want to leave this place . And I don 't need you to make me a cake . I 'm not making you a cake , I 'm making you a custard . It 's my specialty . I don 't like custard . In fact , I 've never liked custard . As a boy , you loved it . You 've just forgotten . Friday is your birthday . You deserve something wonderful . Well , for my birthday , can I have getting the hell out of here ? We need to celebrate and make sure that Agent Dunham can attend . I want to see her face when she eats my pudding . That 's disturbing . Peter Bishop . What ? - Mr. Bishop ? - Yeah . - Agent Jessup . Hi . - Hi . - This is my father Walter . - Yes . I have a couple questions for you . - How bad is she ? - We don 't know . Excuse me ? How do you not know ? Can you just explain exactly what you do ? You 're some sort of special consultant ? - Where 's Charlie ? - I 'm sorry , Charlie who ? Agent Charlie Francis . Where is he ? I believe he 's en route from Quantico . I 'm the agent in charge . Well , agent in charge , where is Olivia Dunham ? Witnesses report that after the crash , a man was seen leaving the car on foot , but no one saw anyone leave the SUV . The doors are still locked , the seatbelt still buckled , the airbags deployed , but there 's no indentation which implies no one was behind the wheel at the moment of impact . Did you check to make sure these skid marks match the other vehicle ? Look , you still haven 't told me what it is you do . You , Agent Dunham , your father . I checked with the field office , they said that all of your work is- - Classified , and that you don 't have access . I don 't have time for this . It 's not that I don 't appreciate - petulance , Mr. Bishop , But the sooner you cooperate- - I would love to cooperate as soon as you can find me an agent who can actually help me . " A New Day in the Old Town " Walter . I 'm afraid your friend 's injuries were too severe . Oh , come on . We were unable to restore any brain function . Patients who suffer this kind of head trauma simply don 't regain consciousness . Simple . Reductive . Absurd . Life and death , these are relative terms . Contextually defined , dependent on cultural specifics . Walter- - He is undoubtedly indulging in primitive diagnostics . Agent Dunham is not dead . She 's not dead . She 's not dead . - Walter- - - She 's not . Walter ! Walter , wait , stop . - You can 't go back there . - Doctor , please ... Back off . I 'm so sorry , Olivia . Mind if I join you ? I 'm guessing you don 't drink . Double . How did you find me ? I work for the F.B.I. Where 's your father ? My father is off in la-la land . Mixed himself up a really nice cocktail of Valium , Haldol , Seconal , and I think Lorazepam . Astrid is baby-sitting . I 've been called to Washington tomorrow . The efficacy of the division is being questioned . I 've been informed that our failure to deliver any useable results is unacceptable . They 're shutting you down ? What were we even doing , anyway ? We 'd sit around and wait for somebody to die , some grisly , macabre death , or for the entire fabric of the Universe to come shredding apart . We were the clean-up crew , sent in to mop it up and make sure it was all neat and tidy for the file . We were always too late anyway . That 's not entirely true . We were too late for Olivia . To Agent Dunham . To Agent Dunham . Hey , Rach . When 'd you get back ? A few hours ago . Ella 's at a friend 's house . You know , I didn 't want her to remember her aunt like this . She had a living will . No life support . They 're gonna do this in- - in the morning , so I 've just been sitting with her , and ... Do you wanna ... Yes . You know she liked you , Peter . Did you know that ? Hey . Good-bye , Olivia . Einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy . Can you tell me your name ? It 's Olivia Dunham . Do you know the year ? Why am I in a hospital , and what is wrong with my leg ? You were in an accident . Do you remember ? In New York . Is Peter here ? I need to see him . He 's here , he 's here . I-I went somewhere . I know , you went to New York . No . Yeah , but no . Olivia , look , you were in an accident . No , no , I was trying to get somewhere and someone was trying to stop me , but I went there anyway , and- - Oh , God , what is happening ? Mr. Bishop , please ! She needs to stay calm . He told me something . - Who ? - I don 't know . I can 't remember . But , oh , it was very important . There 's something that I have to do . Who , Olivia ? Who told you to do what ? I don 't know , but there 's something that I have to do , - and I- - - What ? I think that our lives may depend on it . Whose lives ? Everyone 's . That beta blocker . Get her pulse down . No , Peter , I need my gun . Please , I 'm not safe . Somebody hurt me , they did this to me . Please , Peter , my gun . I need my gun . Please , Peter . 'scuse me . I need to speak with Special Agent Broyles . Agent Broyles is in Washington . Uh , then Agent Francis , please . Charlie Francis . Sir , what is this regarding ? Okay , I work for you guys . I 'm a consultant . I need access to a file on a car accident yesterday in New York City . I 'm sorry , these credentials have been revoked , Mr. Bishop . - What ? Look , lady , you need to help me . Please feel free to file a civilian request on our website . Web- - No , listen to me . One of your agents is in the hospital , and her life- - and possibly yours- - depends on the work that I need to do , so you find me somebody who can help me . Okay , sir , if you 'd exit the building- - AMY : I 'll take him . I 'm with her . What 're you doing in Boston ? AMY : You like to fight , Mr. Bishop ? All that time in Iraq . Mob connections . You 've got quite a combative history . Look , you said you were gonna help me get my hands on that file . It 's on the seat behind you . What ? Something wasn 't adding up about those skid marks . They were darkest at the back , not the front . So maximum torque farthest away from the incident . That means the driver wasn 't slowing down . He was speeding up . Then he must 've been waiting . Those are pictures from the surveillance camera in the parking structure adjacent to the accident site . George Reed . 524 Littlefield Road . Here , in Lexington . We 're 15 minutes away . All right , now it 's your turn . What 's the Fringe Division ? What do you people do ? Nothing . Not anymore . F.B.I. George Reed ? Mr. Reed ? Body . Look at his lividity . If this guy was driving a car in New York , it wasn 't yesterday . I need to get a ride for someone . Feel his anus . It 's soaking wet . Expansion of the Oral mucosa , the eyes , and the rectum to accommodate rapid fluid loss . If it 's a virus , it obviously doesn 't affect birds . Or people , at least not quickly . Agent , I need this body taken back to my lab . Hey , lunatic , this body 's going to the morgue . Is he crazy ? Peter ? Who is the agent in charge here ? I am . Take it wherever he wants . Lovely . Is he crazy ? Oh , yeah . AMY : Whatever Fringe Division is or was , F.B.I. says it 's been shut down . And yet I just sent you a body . Which does begs the question , why are you doing this ? Just following the case . It doesn 't pay to bluff a bluffer , Agent Jessup . You know , a lot of people would be scared by this . Most , actually . There are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamt- - Oh , wow . Really ? Butchered Shakespeare . WALTER : Peter . Peter ! They said I can ride in the back with the body . Can I ? Sure . Of course you can . Stay out of the medications , though . Please . Think I 've been waiting for you people my whole life . I 'll be with you in just a minute . So what can I do you for ? I 'm looking for a selectric . Selectric 251 . Doesn 't exist . They never made one . It 's 245 , straight to 255 . No , no , no . I 'm still gonna need the 251 . Ah . You 're one of them . You know , it 's been six years . I just kind of figured that , uh ... Straight back . Last door . Hey . You--you tell ' em . I 'm not waiting around forever . I am not waiting around forever . AMY : What are we doing here ? PETER : As I 'm sure you 're probably already aware , my father was a scientist . Who was sent to St. Claire 's . A mental institution , yes , but there is more . Worse . And some good , too . It 's complicated . But for right now , all you really need to know is that this building is where he used to work . He was working here as a professor . Simultaneously , he was working on a number of top-secret government projects . We do our thing down here in the lab because according to him , it 's the only place that he can work . You 're coming up on your last chance to turn back . Are you kidding ? Agent Jessup ... Welcome to Fringe Division . Astrid , Amy . Amy , Astrid . Nice haircut . Thanks . Hi . - Hello . - Oh , hello . Again . I need four bunsen burners , eight metal bowls yea big , and a freezer . The bowls need to be sterilized ? It 's not for the autopsy . It 's for the custard . For Peter 's birthday . Walter , will you forget about the custard ? I refuse . Also rib cutters , toothed forceps , and a bone saw for the autopsy . Not for the groceries . CHARLIE : I got here as fast as I could . I 'm all right . You didn 't have to come all this way . You 're not all right . Charlie , I 'm fine . My second year with Brooklyn P.D. , one night we get a domestic disturbance call . Partner and I go over to his house . I 'm with the guy , right ? And he 's , uh ... saying it 's nothing , you know , just a little argument . My partner calls from the other room and says that we need an ambulance for the girl . And I just know the guy beat the crap out of his girlfriend , so I go for my gun , I get him on the ground , and I 'm cuffing him . And I hear a gunshot from the other room . I turn around , and this , uh , bloody girl- - brutalized , brutalized girl- - is , um ... aiming a gun at me . What I didn 't know at the time was she 'd just killed my partner . She fires . Hits me in my chest . Anyway , um ... I 'm in I.C.U. for six days . You know , and , um , hospital for two weeks . Kept on telling my wife , " I 'm fine . " I was shaken , and I was scared . Now , if you 're like me , you got a gun underneath your pillow . Peter called me . Hey . You can fool the doctors , kiddo . You can 't fool me . I don 't know what happened to me . I 'm so scared . I can 't even load it . My hand won 't stop shaking . Charlie , I can 't . I can 't even load it . You 're gonna be all right . Hey , it 'll be all right . It 's a shame . These lungs were in excellent condition once . Is the half and half boiling ? Yeah , just about . Mix the eggs , sugar , and salt in a separate bowl . Please . Walter , there 's nothing wrong with the blood sample . What are you thinking ? It 's funny . I love custard , but I hate flan . Which could be an issue of semantics . Or difficulty with the French . Which I doubt , given my near obsession with Moules a la creme normande . Well , that 's fascinating , but what I actually meant was are there any theories about how this man died ? No , the water expulsion , though dramatic and messy , seems to be a symptom of some other process . But I stumbled upon something that did the unthinkable . Look inside the mouth . You can come closer , dear . Look at the soft palate . What do you see ? PETER : There are three markings . Indents like stab wounds . What are they ? And while we 're at it , what do you mean you stumbled across something that does the unthinkable ? It made me remember something . Is this you ? Yeah . My father recently took a little trip down memory lane , and for no reason has become wildly obsessed with my childhood . He also likes to check and make sure that I 'm still breathing when he thinks that I 'm asleep , which is a little creepy . Focus , please . This is an experiment that Belly and I did . We came up with such a spectacular blend of drugs . One day , Leary came by , and he said , " You 're kidding me . " Is this gonna make her head explode or something ? Well , in a sense , yes , but not physically . We 're trying to augment her fifth , sixth , and seventh chakras . Throat , third eye , and crown . That is correct , Asterix . Astrid . Communication , speech , clairaudience , cognition , and thought . Spirituality . I can see Him . You wanted her to see God . WALTER ON VIDEO : Who is he ? The man with the machine . The three- - the three nails . The three nails go in the mouth . There . He is a soldier . From somewhere else . He 's--he 's from a place that looks like this , but it 's not here . Oh , he 's- - He 's from another universe , man . Oh , I can see him . He pushes up the machine . WALTER ON VIDEO : He pushes up the machine ? Oh , yes , in the mouth . And then he changes . That 's how they change . They 're like shape shifters . That 's how they hide . They can look like us . They can look like any of us . Astrid . I need you to log on to the joint law enforcement database . We need to be informed immediately of any corpse that matches that description . They can look like any of us . Unsubstantiated claims of invasion . Reports of technology run amok . The old " X " designation and your fringe investigations have been indulgences in the federal budget for over half a century . Well , the salad days are over , Mr. Broyles . Colonel . Excuse me ? BROYLES : Or Special Agent , as you 'd prefer , Senator . SENATOR : Colonel Broyles . Philip , listen . We all have a job here , and we- - Yes , Senator , I have a job . The same job I have had in three administrations and six wars to defend our national security , and I assure you we are not secure . Yes , sometimes a threat is familiar . But I have come to learn that sometimes it is far worse . And when it is worse , when the threat is unimaginable , that is when we are at the door . And you should thank God for that . Phillip , without something usable , something to support the human and fiscal cost ... I-I 'm sorry . If your appearance is any indication ... Now I don 't have to tell you how important it is that Fringe Division not be shut down . I 'm not the one who needs convincing . But we 've tried . I 'm afraid that this one is out of our hands . Do what you always used to do , Phillip . Save the day . Feds ? Yeah , that 's us . Well , her , technically , but say us . Where 's the body that triggered the alert ? The one that has the three holes in its mouth ? It 's right over there . Thank you . They found this guy two blocks from the accident site . Shape shifters must leave the original body behind . Do you remember the girl from the video ? That she said he was a soldier ? My father was a soldier . They do one thing , life or death . They stay on mission . These killings weren 't random . Which means this man , this thing , whatever it is , it 's still trying to accomplish its goal . Olivia . Oh , my God . You scared me to death . We 've sent his description to hospital security and dispatch all available agents . If he 's there , we 'll get him . You 're looking better . Thank you . I 'm starting to feel a little bit more like me . So how 's your memory ? Still all just fragments . I remember going to New York , I remember driving , but I can 't seem to see anything past that . Happens with head injuries . People can lose days before an accident . The best thing to do is just to keep trying , Olivia . I was on my way somewhere to meet with someone . And I guess someone hit my car . But- - But ... ? It doesn 't make any sense . Mm-hmm . It 's as if I went somewhere and talked to someone . And then ... came back to the accident . Do you remember who you were going to meet with ? No . Almost . He told me something . What ? Go on . I can 't , uh- - Try . Something 's hidden . Yes . Where ? I-I can 't- - Where is it hidden ? I can 't remember . That 's really all you know then , isn 't it ? Yeah . Okay . They have surveillance of your suspect entering the lobby . Olivia 's room ? The floor 's locked up six ways from Sunday . The only person allowed in is the nurse . Don 't fight it . It 's over . Agent Francis , suspect is now white female , black hair , scrubs , gray sweater . She jumped down to the loading dock , but she 's heading into the basement . You okay ? Go get that bitch . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Charlie ! Hey ! You okay ? You hit ? CHARLIE : I 'm good . So who was she ? Walter thinks that she was a shape-changing soldier from another universe . He thinks that might be where you went . Hmm . Do you think it 's a bad sign that I can say that out loud and neither one of us thinks I 'm crazy ? She thought I knew where something was hidden . No matter what happened to you , and no matter where you went , Walter will figure it out . Olivia , I need to ask you something . Sure . Einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy . You said that to me just after you woke up . Do you remember it ? No . Latin ? Mm-mm . Greek . My mother used to say that to me every night before I went to bed . There really isn 't a point where things just can 't get weirder , is there ? What does it mean ? It means , " Be a better man than your father . " Walter was already gone . It was like a code between my mother and me . It meant keep your people close . Take care of the people you care about . Well , you 're good at that . It 's good to see you again , Olivia Dunham . It 's good to see you too . NURSE : It 's time to check your vitals . You should get some rest . OLIVIA : Peter . Is it true that they 're shutting us down ? No . PETER : Agent Broyles . BROYLES : Mr. Bishop . At the bar , you said they needed to see results . Yeah . Walter says this tech isn 't from here . And that it 's broken . But it is proof . And if they can fix it , they can have an army who can look like anyone they want them to . You tell them you can get this tech , and they can have it , but they are not shutting us down . From now on , we 're calling the shots . We 're done reacting . We 're not gonna be too late anymore . After all , somebody 's got to save their asses , right ? You surprise me , Mr. Bishop . Thanks . WALTER ASTRID : Happy birthday , Peter ! Look . Custard . ASTRID : Happy birthday , Peter .

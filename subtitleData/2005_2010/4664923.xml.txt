 The season is summer . The long-awaited finals are coming up . Every bit of happiness that was inside me is now loitering around Brazil and it doesn 't look like any of it 's coming back . Hey . Do you know what day it is today ? Your birthday ? No . Asahina-san 's birthday . No . Koizumi or Nagato 's birthday . You think I would know their birthdays ? my birthday is ... No one cares ! You have no idea how important today is do you ? All I see is another hot weekday . Tell me what day and what month it is . July 7th . aren 't you ? Of course I am ! It 's Tanabata ! { TL Note : Asian Valentine 's Day . } you should never forget it ! Is that right ? I take festivals like this one very seriously . we 're going to have a grand Tanabata with everyone each and every year ! And so it started . Grave : Lead a materialistically simple yet spiritually fulfilling life . 570 ) } Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody There 's a law that states that when Haruhi suggests something back and sideways meaninglessly . This law has governed my every day since this spring . I 'm starting to hate myself for getting used to this kind of lifestyle . Yes ! Yo . Good afternoon . Hello . How 's life ? I 've felt like a crazy mess every day since entering high school . Here . Thank you very much . You 're most welcome . How about a game ? I 'm getting tired of Othello since we play it all the time . I don 't know the rules . That 's too bad . you know . Once she comes up with something meaningless again - Yahooooi ! 'pologies ' pologies ! Sorry I 'm late ! Where did you get that and your greeting ? The forest behind the school . Isn 't that private property ? You bamboo thief . Look ! I made some paper strips too ! write down your wishes ! Paper strips ? I see . It 's Tanabata today . there 's a condition ! What condition ? We haven 't even agreed to it yet . do you know who the two responsible for granting the wishes on Tanabata are ? Aren 't they Orihime and Hikoboshi ? I 'll give you that . 10 points . But do you know which stars Orihime and Hikoboshi are ? Nope . right ? 85 points ! that means your paper strips have to be facing towards those stars ! So what happened to the remaining 15 points ? Let me explain . According to the Special Theory of Relativity there 's no way to go faster than the speed of light . respectively . 113 ) \ frz20 } Vega 243 ) } 25 light years 43 ) } Altair 43 ) } Altair 247 ) \ cH9AA093 } 16 light years 247 ) \ cH9AA093 } { \ alphaHFF } 16 light { \ alphaH00 } years 247 ) \ cH9AA093 } 16 light years 31 ) \ cH949688 } Vega 101 ) \ fs18 \ cH7D7C71 } 25 light years 201 ) \ cH808674 } Altair 321 ) } 16 light years 107 ) \ fs18 \ cH605F53 } Earth the time it takes for a message to reach one of those stars is approximately the same amount ! You looked all that up just for this ? So that means our wishes won 't get granted by those stars until after the time it takes to reach them ! Wishes like " I want a boyfriend before Christmas this year " wouldn 't make it in time . If that 's the case doesn 't that mean we 're looking at around 50 or 32 years for our wishes to come true ? so they 'll do something about that . Like a 50 % off summer bargain . what happened to the Theory of Relativity ? Take 2 paper strips : one for Altair and one for Vega . Then write down the wishes that you want to come true in 25 and 16 years ' time ! I don 't even know what I 'll be doing in 25 or 16 years ' time . What the hell am I supposed to write ? She always comes up with the stupidest things that normal people don 't . Which universe did her common sense come from anyway ? You can 't really say that . she knows full well what common sense is . And how would you know that ? Suzumiya-san wishes that the world was considerably different than what it is now . And she even has the power to rebuild the world from scratch . I don 't think she 's lost her sense of reason yet . You there ! Quit whispering to each other ! 244 ) } I hope I get better at cooking 297 ) } I hope I get better at sewing I think she 's misunderstanding something . 201 ) } Harmony 149 ) } Reform 149 ) } Home Safety 207 ) } World Peace 284 ) } Koizumi Itsuki 345 ) } Koizumi Itsuki Mine are just a bit typical . 164 ) } Give me money 340 ) } Give me a bungalow that has a yard where I can wash my dog . How plebian . Shut up . 227 ) } Make the world revolve around me 312 ) } I want the Earth to reverse its rotation . Mine are way better than yours . We just have different values . make sure you remember what you wrote ! The first checkpoint will be in 16 years ! It 's a race to see whose wish Hikoboshi grants first ! huh ... What a long time ... Haruhi seemed to be in abnormally low spirits and had an air of melancholy emanating from her . to say the least . It 's scary to think about her reaction after being so quiet . Would you like some more tea ? yes please . She 's cute . Now ! please stay in the clubroom - Mikuru Your wish is my command ! Book : When You 're in Love ... I 'm going home . Take care of the keys if you 're the last one . me too . you have my thanks . Hey ... I 'm leaving first . Okay . I 'm glad we were left alone pretty naturally . Is this something the others shouldn 't know about ? Uh ... yes . Um ... there 's a place I want to go to with you . All right . Where to ? Um ... To three years ago . Thr - ... I 'm sorry for saying something weird so suddenly ! Um ... you don 't want to ? Are you talking about time travel ? I am . but ... Why me ? For what reason ? you 'll ... understand once you get there . Probably . Please ! Don 't ask any questions and just say okay ! Or else ... I 'll ... I ... I 'll be in trouble . She 's really cute . Well ... I guess . Really ? ! Thank you ! So damn cute . What a relief . me believing that she was a time traveler wasn 't just based on her word alone . the existence of adult Asahina-san is the only bit of proof I have . wouldn 't it ? So where 's the time machine ? We 'll go from right here . Right here ? Kyon-kun . Sorry . you 're awake ! Um ... if you don 't get up soon my legs are going to fall asleep . Why was I asleep ? I can 't let you know how to travel through time . It 's classified information . Um ... are you angry ? not at all . I 'd have punched her already . it 's all okay . That 's a relief . So we 're now three years back in time ? three years ago . I think it 's about 9 o 'clock at night . Seriously ? Seriously . This is the same park that Nagato called me to last time . Is this a mecca for weird people ? Asahina-san ? Um ... Is she trying to imply something with this ? good evening . Asahina-san . So this is what I looked like back then . It was her job to guide you to this place . guiding you will be my job . Were you the one who put Asahina-san to sleep ? I can 't let her see me since I hadn 't seen myself when I was her . Go down that road and you 'll see a school . Help the person who 'll be standing in front of the school gate . but please carry my old self over there with you . This feels like a game event . Do I get some kind of item as a reward ? Reward ? Let 's see ... I don 't have anything to give you . But you can just steal a kiss from my sleeping self over there . though . Thats ... a bit ... In terms of my beliefs and the situation that goes against my values . However . Nah . But ... It 's time . I need to go . And please keep me a secret from her . okay ? Pinky promise . Pinky promise ! Kyon-kun . See you again . I wonder how long it 'll be before I meet the adult Asahina-san again ? It feels like she hasn 't changed at all since we last met . is this really three years ago ? I need to find a way to make sure . Should I call 117 ? 147 ) } East Municipal Middle School huh ? Hey ! Who are you ? This really is three years ago . at the moment a first year middle school student . I asked you who you are ! A pervert ? A kidnapper ? What 're you doing here ? Isn 't it obvious ? I 'm illegally trespassing . I can 't believe you openly declared your criminal intent . come and help me . I 'll report you . It 's Haruhi . There 's no mistake about it . This way . Thank goodness it 's dark . That way she won 't be able to get a good look at our faces . after all . I get the feeling we 'd get into trouble if that wasn 't the case . I hid this stuff after taking it out of storage this evening . don 't you think ? I 'll take that for you . You grab the line marker . So what do you want to do with this ? Draw the lines according to my instructions . Me ? Yes . You . I need to be the one directing after all . That line is crooked ! What 're you doing ? ! This girl is calmly ordering around a high school student that she 's never even met before . that 's so Haruhi-like . Even if this was the first time I met this middle school girl I probably would 've thought that she 's pretty messed in the head . following Haruhi 's instructions I was running left and right drawing white lines on the sports grounds . I never would 've thought that the message Taniguchi was talking about the other day was drawn by myself . Hm . It 's passable . Sorry it 's not perfect . Do you think aliens exist ? That was sudden . Answer my question . don 't they ? What about time travelers then ? I wouldn 't be surprised if they did too . And espers ? They 're probably all over the place . People from parallel universes ? I haven 't met any yet . right ? Yeah . What 's your name ? John Smith . Are you stupid ? Let me keep my anonymity . Who were you carrying ? My big sister . She has a sleeping disorder that makes her suddenly fall asleep . She can fall asleep anywhere and anytime . So I end up carrying her . And ? What exactly is this ? Isn 't it obvious ? It 's a message . Don 't tell me it 's for Orihime and Hikoboshi . How did you know ? it 's Tanabata . You just remind me of someone I know who does this kind of stuff too . I 'd love to meet that person . Is there someone like that at North High ? Yep . huh ? I 'm going home . I 've completed what I came to do . See ya . Not even a word of thanks for all that help ? Asahina-san . W-W-W-W-Where is this ? What ? Why ? What time is it ? Um ... The TPDD is gone ! Eh ? It 's gone ! What happened ? What 's a TPDD ? It 's classified so I can 't explain but it 's something like a time machine . How did you lose it ? I don 't know ... but I did ... Is there anyone who can come save us ? There isn 't ! what will happen to us ? We 'll be stuck * hick * here . We 're stuck on the time plane of three years in the past and we can 't go back to our own time ! That 's quite serious . It really is . I don 't even feel an iota of tension . The one who took the TPDD thingy might 've been the adult Asahina-san . That was probably why she came back to the past . Because she herself had already experienced losing the TPDD ... I think we may have a way out . Is this the residence of Nagato Yuki-san ? but ... Would it help if I said that I 'm an acquaintance of Suzumiya Haruhi ? Yo . Can we come in ? and the reason why we 're here . the you from three years in the future gave me this . Understood . correct ? Yes . Requesting access permission for memory of temporal variants in an external time period . Download of reversible data from linked time planes complete . The me from the temporal plane of three years in the future and the present me are now the same person . Memory has been shared . How did you do that ? Synchronization . I don 't understand . Why are you wearing a North High uniform ? Have you enrolled already ? No . The me right now is on standby . What do you mean by standby ? You mean you will be on standby for three more years ? Yes . That a terribly long time . It 's my mission . There is more than one way to move through time . The TPDD is just a device for controlling space-time . It 's unreliable and primitive . what do you mean ... When a TPDD is used to transfer organic matter through time there are problems with limited range and noise generation . To us that is not perfect . By " us " you mean the Integrated Data Sentient Entity ? you can travel through time with a complete form ? Form is unnecessary . All that is required is to be able to transmit the same identity data . but ... Are you telling us to sleep here ? Yes . Just Asahina-san and I ? Yes . Sleep . Straight to the point ! Just sleep . that 's what we were planning to do ... W - W-Well ... it looks like there 's no way around this . Yeah ... What ? Really ? ! What happened ? Is that your TPDD ? this is just a digital watch . we 're back . It 's just past 9 : 30 on the day we left . How did you do it ? By freezing a selected set of fluid data in space into stasis . And then by unfreezing at the corresponding end point in the space-time continuum . You mean you stopped time ? ! Huh ? Nagato-san stopped time in this room for three years . she unfroze it . Right ? Yes . I can 't believe it ! that means that when I first visited you and heard you talk about aliens and stuff ... Asahina-san and I were sleeping in the next room ? Yes . I always thought you were hiding your true powers from us . But doesn 't this make you invincible ? That 's not true . This is an exception . Emergency mode . it won 't be accessible . Thank you . No problem . Can you read what it says ? I am here . That 's what 's written . but this isn 't a real language used by real aliens somewhere is it ? Nagato didn 't answer me . Forgive me . I ... um ... I don 't really understand myself ... I 'm an underling . a grunt . it 's because I 'm more like a trainee . you 're close to Haruhi . That 's only because no one thought that I would be the one Suzumiya-san would catch and pull into her club . just give me orders and I move according to those orders . That 's why I don 't even know the meaning behind some of the things I do . isn 't it ? That adult version of Asahina-san probably knows what 's going to happen to us already . But it doesn 't look like she told this Asahina-san anything . Oh well . People from the future also have their own rules and laws I guess . once everything has settled down . The next day . the 8th of July . it 's just the next day . it feels like three years have passed . What 's wrong ? Did you eat something poisonous or something ? Nothing 's wrong . It 's just melancholy from reminiscing . I 've got some memories of Tanabata from the past . Is that so ? right ? Yes . In that case I get the feeling that there 's a lack of consistency regarding the ability to travel through time . What do you mean ? Asahina-san once told me that there was no continuity between the past and the future . But I went back three years and granted Haruhi some of my wisdom and it seems like there 's a distinct possibility that those ideas brought her to North High to look for people who ... aren 't " just humans " . This means that there 's continuity between the past and future . Isn 't that contrary to what Asahina-san said ? A standard axiomatic theory cannot be used to prove the existence of a paradox within a given incident itself . but ... You 'll understand eventually . That 's just how it is . my king is being checked by your rook . This is troublesome . Where should I run to ? now where 's the paradox in me doing this ? a king doesn 't really mean much to us . The queen is the most important up until the very end . is that so ? I 've got no idea what 's going to happen next but I just want something that won 't give me a headache to happen . I think peace and quiet is best but would you prefer something to happen instead ? You troublemaker .

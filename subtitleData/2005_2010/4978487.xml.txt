 We are coming . We are coming . We are coming . We are coming . We want ten percent of the children of this world . And if we refuse ? We will wipe out your entire species . I can survive anything , but you can 't . No , no , no , no , no , no . Not him ! And tomorrow , your people will deliver the children . There 's one thing I always meant to ask Jack . Back in the old days . I wanted to know about that Doctor of his . The man who appears out of nowhere and saves the world . Except sometimes he doesn 't . All those times in history when there was no sign of him , I wanted to know why not . But I don 't need to ask any more . I know the answer now . Sometimes the Doctor must look at this planet and turn away in shame . I 'm recording this in case anyone ever finds it , so you can see ... You can see how the world ended . Today , we 're taking steps to safeguard your children . The schools are being opened again . And we urge all of you to send your children back to their classes straight away . Government representatives will be visiting certain schools to discuss a series of inoculations . - What 's inoculations ? - Injections . - I don 't want to go to school . - You 're not going , either . You 're staying put . Just like your Uncle Ianto said . " Don 't trust any of them . " - But the man said we got to go . - And I know for a fact he 's lying . These inoculations are to protect your children . These inoculations are safe . These inoculations will guarantee no repeat of the problems of the past four days . David , on your feet . Go to the Baxters opposite , then go to Sally 's , then go to Mrs Singh . Tell ' em we 'll have the kids , only free of charge . - It 's 10 quid a kid ! - Shut it , you ! And run ! Tell them my brother works for the government , he said it 's not safe . Yes , Mum ! So , I ask of you now , to cooperate , to send your children back to school , and to resume your lives as normal . - We 'd better get ready for school , then . - No , darling . Your father said stay at home with me . Why ? What 's so different about us ? And as ever , I thank you for your patience , your understanding and your faith . We 've isolated 2,600 primary schools , sir . I 'm sorry , but you 'll address me in all matters concerning this operation . This information is for Mr Green . You and Mr Green and this government have proven yourselves incapable of handling this crisis . All decisions will now go through me . You were saying ? We have 2,600 primary schools listed here . We 're mobilising transport . At 1200 hours , the British Army will take the children from their schools to the designated rendezvous points . What if they refuse , the soldiers ? We could have a mutiny on our hands . They 've been told . Any soldier refusing to do his duty will make his own family liable . So we take them to the rendezvous points , but what then ? We 're about to find out . They 're entering Thames House right now . Disinfectant doesn 't work , you can still smell it . There were bodies lying 10 deep around those doors . Mr Dekker , I take it . You managed to survive . I just stood back , sir . A strategy that 's worked all my life . Now then , best not keep it waiting . I seek audience with the 456 . My name is Colonel Augustus Oduya of the Unified Intelligence Taskforce . If I might speak . We have no choice but to initiate your plan , may God help me . But I need to ask . We have designated rendezvous points , selected army bases in all participating countries , but once the children are assembled , what then ? How do you collect them ? As we arrived . Observe . Some sort of transportation device taking them God knows where . Then let me ask , not as a representative , as a father . You need these children . We 've seen you hooked up to that boy , but why ? - Are they keeping you alive ? - No . - Then what are they for ? - The hit . I don 't understand . The hit . They create chemicals . - The chemicals are good . - Good in what way ? We feel good . The chemicals are good . They 're like drugs ? They 're trading in drugs ? You 're shooting up on children ? Our children ? Let 's not forget , your government started this trade . You opened the market over 40 years ago . - Are the troops on standby ? - Yes , sir . Then we begin . The government claims it 's Britain back to normal . Schools across the country are being reopened and parents are being urged to return their children to a normal routine . The inoculation programme will begin at midday , and the World Health Organisation has issued a statement guaranteeing the safety and beneficial effects of the treatments . Critics are still demanding more information but the government is simply asking for trust . The threat still stands . Haven 't we gone past that ? My husband is still out there with everything you 've done recorded on his laptop . One word from me and he will release that information to the public . What do you think Torchwood is now ? - Do you think you 're still players ? - We can try . We 're at a tipping point right now . Civilisation 's about to fall into hell . You wanna start that descent a little earlier ? Go ahead . He 's right . Look what happened . Phone Rhys , tell him we 've lost . Hello ? Yeah , me , I 'm bloody freezing . Where are you ? You all right ? - Do you want me to send the files ? - It 's too late , sweetheart . They 've killed him . Not just Clem , they 've ... They 've killed Ianto . He 's dead . What about Lois ? I 'm afraid Miss Habiba is in police custody . Charged with espionage . Then what about my daughter and her son ? They 're free to go . Ianto Jones , he 's got family back in South Wales , a sister , has she been told ? We 're not releasing any of the names , not yet . Then let Gwen tell her . You said yourself the world is going to hell any second . Before it does , give us a moment of grace . Just take Gwen home , please . I can 't look at her any more . Cell M-3 , Captain Harkness , 9 : 50 am . Captain , is that you ? Captain Harkness , it 's me . It 's Lois . It 's Lois . Captain ? What are they doing ? What 's happening out there ? Can you hear me ? What do we do ? Captain ? You might want to take a look at this . - Steven , come on . - I want to see . Not now , darling , this is for grown-ups . Suzanne , get him a Coke or something . ... received and confirmed . It 's inside Thames House . All recorded by Torchwood . They 're inventive , I 'll give ' em that . That 's a child , abducted in 1965 . Now they want more , millions more . And in two hours ' time , the government is handing them over . Yes ? You asked to see me , sir ? Take a seat . A terrible day . - Sir , I was wondering ... - Your name was chosen , John . Right . Good . In what way chosen ? The inoculation story seems to have gained some currency . Might even be called popular . Indeed . And what 's that got to do with me ? Your children will be inoculated . I see . In two hours , there will be selected news media at your house . You 'll be seen to offer your children for treatment . This will be broadcast on every network channel at 12 : 00 midday . But there is no inoculation . This action will help the public and show them no cause for unrest . You mean , I pretend they 're going to be inoculated ? Your children will then be taken to one of the designated rendezvous points and they 'll become part of the ... the process . It 's our duty now to think beyond this terrible day . And once it 's over , the government must be seen as victims of the 456 . We must be seen to have lost . If you put me on camera , I will tell people the truth . Then your daughters would know where they 're going . Best not . I can 't do it ! I won 't ! You can 't make me ! In which case , your children will be taken without you . But you 've seen what they do to them ! They 're just girls , sir ! They 're just girls ! They 're not ... - They 're not ... They 're not ... - I 'm sorry , John . I 'm really ... I 'm really very sorry . And I 'm really very busy . What did he want ? Bridget , I need a Requisition 31 . What for ? - Quick as you can . - But what for , sir ? Requisition 31 , thank you . Requisition 31 . Just sign there . Croeso I Gymru ! Everyone 's on standby . It 's red alert . Riot gear and everything . All ready to mobilise , except no one 's saying why . - What 's going on ? - I can 't tell you . I am the police ! Right now , Andy , I need you to drive this car . And if I told you ... What ? Well , come on , then . What ? Don 't you bloody hate people who don 't finish their sentences ? Hey , she 's pregnant . Oh , thank you . Who 's she when she 's at home ? Bloody hellfire . - Who 's the father ? - Oh , I 'm slapping you , yeah ? It 's Torchwood . That 's what did it . They give you retcon and chemicals and radiation and God knows what . Bloody Pill didn 't stand a chance . That 's what Torchwood does , you see . It ruins your life . How is it ruined ? You wanna have kids in a world like this , Rhys ? - You 're not getting rid of it . - Is that right ? Take the next left . Ianto 's sister lives off the Cromwell Estate . 00 . One hour to go . Are we in position ? Troops are moving in , sir . 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 18 , 16 , 14 , 12 , 10 , 8 , 20 , 18 , 16 , 14 , 12 , 10 , 8 , 6 , 4 , 2 , 0 . Thank you . I 've come to tell you how we met . Who ? How I met John Frobisher . It was 30 years ago . You weren 't even born . I was on attachment to the civil service , only for six months . And just down the corridor , there he was . You wouldn 't think it to look at him now , but he was a clumsy thing . Always losing his keys . Mr Swales never thought he 'd amount to much , but I thought , " Well , keep an eye on that one . " And all the others came and went . The high flyers , they burnt out or went on to something better . And do you know what John Frobisher did ? He kept working . Head down , worked hard , all his life . It was another 10 years before we actually worked in the same office . He asked for me . I didn 't think he even knew my name . And we made quite the team . I 'm not saying he was perfect . You know that better than me . But he worked hard . He always worked hard . I don 't think that 's valued enough these days , hard work . And he was a good man . I want you to know that . John Frobisher was a good man . Because when the history of this is written , they 'll talk about the ministers , and the soldiers , and the things with numbers for names . And I think people will forget how very good he was . I want you to remember him like that . If ever you think of John Frobisher , just remember that it wasn 't his fault . Now , I think I should get back to work . Rhys , you stay here . Give us a shout if anything happens . - Like what ? - Just keep an eye out , yeah ? - You know Ianto ? - Mmm-hmm . - Was he gay ? - Shut up . - They might not know . - Well , in which case , do not say . Well , that proves my point . Look , listen , there 's a lot more going on . You 've just got to trust me . Okay . She 's got two kids . We need to find out where they are . That 's why we need a car . We might have to pick them up from school and take them back to mine , okay ? Back to yours ? What for ? Andy , we 've got to look after these kids . Just do what I say . Please . - Hello , I 'm Police Constable Andy . - You 're not shutting me down . They 've got food , they 've got drinks , proper drinks . And I got permission off their parents . Come on , have a look . I 'm not apologising . Johnny . Go and do a proper job . I know I need a licence for a creche . I 'm not thick . This is emergency circumstances , right ? I 'm not trusting the telly . If we could have a word in private ... They 're not even paying , so it can 't be illegal , right ? No . I know . It 's not about the kids . I just need a word , if we could . - How many are there ? - Nineteen . But what are they doing here ? Well , they 're not gonna go to school . No way . If they want ' em , they 'll have to come and get ' em . I just need a word . They 've got kids . Ianto 's niece and nephew . Save them . - Do we begin ? - We 've got no choice . You don 't give the orders , Mr Green . Stage one . Mobilise . I don 't care who you are , you haven 't got the authority to just march in here and ... Mr Patel , they can 't just ... They said inoculations , not ... Where are you taking them ? Excuse me , where are you taking them ? What 's going on ? What you doing ? Stay on the other side of the road . Thank you . But my boy 's in there . Taking them off the school premises , you just can 't ! Where are you taking them ? You can 't ! Christopher ! Christopher ! That 's my son ! That 's my bloody son ! You can 't take them off the school premises ! It 's okay . It 's okay . Let it out . He didn 't say anything about my car , did he ? - No . - Sorry . No . There 's something else . Something he wanted me to tell you . - And I 'm sorry , it 's kind of urgent . - You can get out . I knew Ianto properly . I 've worked with him for years . - Come on . Leave her alone . - No . I did . I really ... I did . We were a team . We did all these things together . And he 'd always be fussing about his bloody coffee , yeah ? - Yeah . - And he 'd be talking about you . All the time . You and the kids . And his dad . That 's Ianto , he was always so proud of his dad . - What did he say about him ? - About his job and things . - What job was that ? - He said he was a master tailor . He worked in Debenhams . If Ianto gave you that old shit , then you didn 't know him at all . Here you go . Thanks . It 's started . Jesus . Numbers ? We 're looking at an uptake of about 60percent . As predicted , a lot of the children in the target area have stayed at home . Then we 'd better go and get them . Stage two . Mobilise . I swear on my life , you have to get those kids out of this house . Is there anywhere you can take them ? I don 't know , anywhere safe ? - Gwen . Now , come on . - What ? They 're here . Oh , God . Look , I haven 't got time to explain , okay ? But they are coming for your kids . I swear . - Don 't be stupid . - Shut up . They 're going to come into your house and they 're going to take your kids , and I 'm sorry , but you 've got to believe me . That 's why Ianto died , okay ? He was trying to stop them . They 're gonna come and they 're gonna take your kids . You 'll never see them again . Never . Hey . Hey . He 'll be fine . The nice kids are safe . If you 're gonna get rid of 1 Opercent , then take the 1 Opercent you don 't want . All those kids on street corners , we 've finally got rid of them . While everyone else just stays indoors ? Ninety percent just hugging their kids , not making a sound , just like they did before . I don 't even know your name . I protect the state . I was brought up to believe in and protect the state . Not much good now , are you ? Even if 90percent look the other way , what sort of world are you leaving behind ? I swear to you , if your duty is to protect the state above and beyond any other authority , then the one person you need right now is Jack Harkness . On the floor ! On the floor ! Stay down ! Go ! Go ! Go ! - What 's going on ? Hey ! Move . Captain ! Go , go ! What 's happening ? Captain Harkness ! Captain Harkness ! Here , what are you doing ? Yeah , they 're spies . Hush now , darling . Nice and quiet . Don 't make a sound , just like a game , yeah ? Alpha 186 to Control . Is anyone there ? Fingers on lips . Now , you don 't make a noise until we get there , okay ? You stay nice and quiet , and I 'll get you some sweets , yeah ? - Where is this place ? - It 's down by the field . It 's all boarded up . Right , look . We 've got to go right now . Okay . Come on , everyone ... Alpha 186 to Control . Can you hear me ? We 're playing spies . Now , come on . That 's it . No one makes a sound . Are you coming ? Andy ? Control , this is Alpha 186 . What 's going on ? Take it easy . Take it easy , come on . Hurry , come on . Come on . Keep walking . Rhi ! What the hell are you doing ? You take them . I 'm going out the front . Somebody 's gotta stop them . No , Johnny . Don 't be stupid . It 's not just us , you daft sod . Danno ! Where 's Richie ? Go get him , get Sammy , get all the boys . - What 's happening ? - What is it ? What 's wrong ? What 's wrong ? All that stuff on the news , all that inoculation stuff , it 's bollocks , right ? The government has sold us out . They 're coming to get our kids , and we 're not getting them back , boys , right ? We got to stop them ! We got to stop them ... No ! Give him back ! Give him back ! - Oh , it 's stinking ! - Keep your voice down . Yeah , what I need you to do is to be as quiet as you possibly can , like mice . - Uncle Jack ! - Hey , soldier . - Whoa ! - We haven 't got time ! Listen . Stay with your mom , okay ? Sorry . Would you ... I 'll be back . This should be everything you need . And if it 's not , we 'll find it . - For what ? - Wavelengths . The 456 are named after a wavelength , and that 's got to be the key to fighting back . You 're wasting your time . There 's nothing you can do . I 've analysed those transmissions for 40 years and never broke ' em . What do you think , Captain ? She told me you were good . Was she right ? Let 's get to work . Get me access to the Torchwood software . Log on to the servers and ... Welcome back . It still won 't work . There 's nothing on there . It 's useless . We 've got technology way beyond you . We hacked into Torchwood years ago , you idiot . There 's nothing . Bring him over here . Dad , come and look at this . It 's some sort of pirate station . They 're trying to get the story out to the public . But they 're taking the kids . We 're broadcasting this on Digital 141 . It 's the kids ! Tell everyone to tune in to 141 . There 's one thing I always meant to ask Jack . Back in the old days . I wanted to know about that Doctor of his . All those times in history when there 's no sign of him , I wanted to know why not . But I don 't need to ask any more . I know the answer now . Sometimes the Doctor must look at this planet and turn away in shame . I 'm recording this in case anyone in case anyone ever finds it , so you can see ... You can see how the world ended . You didn 't mean it , did you ? About ... Getting rid of it ? No , of course I didn 't . Okay . I would never ... Never . I wouldn 't do that to you , sweetheart . No , I wouldn 't , and I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . All right , darling ? Illegal broadcast on Digital 141 . Close it down . And take out the whole network if you have to . We 're up to 80percentper . The people are starting to fight back . Colonel , we 're predicting 80percent . Is that acceptable ? We have up to 80percent of the designated children . Is that enough ? All of them . All of the designated to us . Not acceptable , sir . We need the rest . Authorising maximum force . The latest report from Germany . Old-fashioned hard copy , I 'm afraid . The system 's gone into meltdown . You don 't have to be here . It 's what he would have wanted . Do you think so ? I can 't imagine anyone wanting to be in this bloody room . Yes . Yes . If we cycle the wavelength back at them ... I know what you 're trying to do . A constructive wave . Do you think people aren 't working on that all over the world ? But it 's never going to work . The effect would be like shouting at the 456 , that 's all . Just shouting . Why did Clem die ? It was the 456 that killed him . But how did they do it ? Why did they do it ? We 've got the recording here . His mind must have synced to the 456 back when he was a child . But they didn 't need to kill him . He wasn 't any threat . Unless maybe that connection hurt them . This is the 456 at the moment of his death . We 've lifted the sound from the Thames House link . That sound , Mr Dekker , what 's that sound ? I don 't know . It 's new . Exactly . It 's new . We don 't have to analyse the wavelength , just copy it . Turn it into a constructive wave . But we 've got no way of transmitting . Of course you have . - Shut up . - Same way as them . I 'll find something else . What does he mean ? Don 't listen to him . Dekker , tell me . The 456 used children . - To establish the resonance . Meaning what ? We need a child . What do you mean ? Centre of the resonance . Oh , that child 's going to fry . No , Dad . No , tell them no . One child or millions . Dad , no . - Dad , tell them no ! - We 're running out of time . Dad , no ! No , Dad ! Captain ! Steven ! Rhys . Quick . Incoming ! Everybody out ! Quick ! Everybody out ! Quick ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Quick ! Come on ! Quick ! Come on . Quick , out . Come on . Quick , quick , quick , quick ! Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on , quick . Get away ! Get away ! Steven ! Steven ! - Steven ! - Mummy ! No ! - Steven ! - Mummy ! - Mummy ! - My baby ! Mummy ! Steven , run away ! Run ! Run ! What are we doing , Uncle Jack ? What 's happening ? What do you want me to do ? Steven , get away ! No ! Steven ! Steven ! Run ! Run ! Colonel , do we have a report ? Colonel , what happened ? Colonel ? It 's gone , sir . The 456 has gone . What did you do , clever girl ? What did you do ? - What did you do ? Hey ? Oh ! Let her in . No , no , no , no , no ! No ! No ! Somebody help him . Help him ! No , please , no . Why ? Why ? Oh , please ... Prime Minister . The public will be wanting a statement , sir . I suppose you could say we were lucky . A bit soon to tell . We don 't know exactly what happened yet . Lucky with the Americans , I mean . General Pierce took charge without ratification from the United Nations . We can say that today 's events were in American hands . And do you think that 's lucky ? Yes , I do , rather . Your first thought now is to save your own skin . In which case , you might like to know , I paid a visit this morning , sir . I went to see Lois Habiba . You might remember her . I sat with her a while . We had a number of things to discuss . And while I was there , I used the emergency protocols to sign out a particular piece of evidence . Thank you . Contact lenses , sir . The Torchwood contact lenses . And Lois was very helpful . She told me how they worked . I can hardly feel them , sir . But everything that happened in this room has been recorded , sir . All waiting to be made public , by me . Including your statement just now that after the events of today you feel , as you said in your very own words , sir , lucky . You wouldn 't dare . I can have you arrested . I don 't think so . Thank you , Bridget . You 're free to go . And Miss Habiba will be released . I 'll see to it myself . I think I 'll be taking charge of very many things in the days to come . Is that all , sir ? Uncle Jack ! Hey , soldier . There 's no more road . We 'll have to walk from now on . You all right ? You fuss over me one more time ... - I 'm just saying . - Well , don 't . Couldn 't have just chosen a pub , could you ? It 's bloody freezing . My feet . Oh , I miss that , the Welsh complaining . - You look good . - I look huge . She 's bloody gorgeous . You okay ? Yeah . Did it work ? Travelled all sorts of places . This planet is too small . The whole world is like a graveyard . Come back with us . Haven 't travelled far enough yet . Got a lot of dirt to shake off my shoes . And right now , there 's a cold-fusion cruiser surfing the ion reefs just at the edge of the solar system , just waiting to open its transport dock . I just need to send a signal . They found it in the wreckage . Indestructible . Like its owner . I put on a new strap for you . - Cost me 50 quid , that . - Bill me . Are you ever coming back , Jack ? - What for ? - For me . It wasn 't your fault . - I think it was . - No . Steven and Ianto and Owen and Tosh and Suzie and ... All of them , because of me . But you saved us . Didn 't you ? I began to like it . And look what I became . Still , I have lived so many lives . It 's time to find another one . They died . And I am sorry , Jack , but you cannot just run away . You cannot run away . Oh , yes , I can . Just watch me . Let 's go home , yeah ? Yeah . Yeah .

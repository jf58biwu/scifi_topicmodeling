 Something wasn 't right . that 's how I felt . While I was watching a match between two teams that I had never heard of before on TV I got the feeling that Haruhi was about to cause a commotion again . { On Screen : Incoming ... } the phone ... You don 't have to tell me . I know . Kyon . right ? We 're all meeting in front of the station at exactly 2 o 'clock . Make sure you come ! I didn 't even get to say a thing . What ? I forgot to tell you what to bring . Bring your swimming gear and lots of money ! And make sure - right ? Huh ? Yeah . You know what I 'm thinking . You 're paying if you 're late ! How did I know about the bike ? He hit it ! And it goes ... and goes ... It 's going over the left field wall ! I think he 's going to reach home . He reached home ! That was a home run . See ? The visitors are in the lead with 8 runs ! Where did I put my swim trunks again ? Summer is going to end soon . Kyon ! 395 ) } Endless Eight yeah . Sorry for making you guys wait . too . Jeez . You need to show more enthusiasm ! let 's go ! Where are we going ? of course ! I see . so I guess we would . we should have summer activities like what people do in the summer ! you know . That 's why we 're doing this now ! This is our once-in-a-lifetime freshman summer vacation ! Kyon ! You listening ? we 're going to the pool by bike . Where 'd you guys put your bikes ? you and I are the only ones who brought bikes . in other words ... This was the plan ! ? Kyon ? You can 't lose to Koizumi-kun ! take off ! Charge ! Demon ! Monster ! Sign : Please park bikes and motorbikes in an orderly fashion . Kyon ! We came here to have fun ! Why 're you acting all worn out already ? Just whose fault do you think that is ? Whose ! ? the crowds ! The smell of chlorine ! This is what it 's all about ! let 's find a place to put our bags and go swim ! Wait ! Can 't she read the signs that say " No Diving " ? The water is nice and warm ! Mikuru-chan ! Yuki ! What are you two doing ? Hurry up and get in ! You go in first . She 's getting noisy again . All right then . Suzumiya-san ! Wait for us ! You guys are so slow . W-Wait ! Don 't pull ... doesn 't it ? I mean . Don 't you think she may have found a normal way of enjoying things ? Is inviting people by calling them up all of a sudden then hanging up on them after stating her one-sided demands considered " normal " ? From my perspective something that minor isn 't a big deal at all . there shouldn 't be anything happening that will endanger the world . If only that were true ... What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's probably just my imagination . We 've been through a lot since spring . I think I might have become a little neurotic . Weird . Him too ? this should be called a " pool for the masses " instead of a " pool for the public " . So that 's where she went ? What 's with her ? What 's she doing all by herself ? What ? What 's this feeling ? I feel like I 've seen this ... I 've seen Nagato like this before . Kyon ! Haruhi ! I 'm certain Haruhi said something like ... " These two are my brigade members . " They 'll listen to everything I say . So ask them anything ! We 're going to play water soccer ! All members have to participate ! Yuki ! Since when was I capable of precognition ? Kyon . Take the ball . Guess I 'm not . I 'm sure it was a fluke . I guess . I 've decided on the activities ! What 's that exactly ? It 's our plan for how to pass what little remains of summer vacation ! There 's only two weeks left ! All of this in just under two weeks ? do you have anything you want to do ? Maybe goldfish scooping ? Okay ! Goldfish ... scooping . I 'm sorry . Please excuse me . Thanks . we 're going to start tomorrow ! I wonder if there 's an Obon festival being held near here . A fireworks show would be nice too . I 'll look into it . I 'll contact you later on . Don 't forget the goldfish scooping ! after all . I 'm paying again ? I told you that you 'd be paying if you were late . that 's it for today ! Later ! Me too . See you later . Okay . Nagato ? well ... It 's nothing . How have you been feeling lately ? Been doing fine ? Fine . I see . That 's great . Indeed . Well ... that 's all . for holding you up . Why ? Why did I call out to her exactly ? The next morning . Haruhi called me again . " We 've found an Obon festival location . " Tonight at the public sports ground . Sorry for the wait ! You 're slo - Woah ! You girls look great . after all . Especially Mikuru-chan ! I 'm impressed with my own sense of style ! it 's great . Great ! Hmm ... I wonder where the important stuff is . Why ? I feel like I 've been here recently . That stage ... That food stall ... My memories are ... Mikuru-chan ! The goldfish scooping you wanted to do is over there ! Let 's catch a ton ! please wait ! Shall we do the same ? it 's all right . do you want to get something to eat ? You 're interested in that stuff ? Which one do you want ? It 's fine . This one . Storekeeper : Sure ! That 'll be 800 yen . but ... Thirteen fish ! we just took one each . Here . I 'll let you have one . Thanks . what 's with the mask ? I bought it . Oh ... really . Right ! Fireworks are next ! Let 's do that to finish today off ! it was summer vacation . but there was one thing bothering me . We 'll go bug catching tomorrow . but have you finished your homework ? Homework ? You can do all of that in three days . then knock yourself out with fun . That 's the right way to enjoy summer vacation ! why are you so unfair ? Everyone ! We 're catching bugs tomorrow ! Cicadas only ! It 'll be the SOS Brigade Cicada Catching Competition ! it was ridiculously nice . we held the SOS Brigade Cicada Catching Competition . but ... the winner was Haruhi . We should go with a " catch and release " mentality after all . they might repay us with a favor in the future . What can a short-lived cicada do for us ? I felt like I was Pandora . we were gathered for some random reason given a bunch of frog costumes to wear and ended up handing out balloons in front of a supermarket as a part-time job . Now I know what the Hajj feel like . Thanks for your hard work everyone ! What 's with her cheerfulness anyway ? Good job ! The manager was really grateful ! I don 't need the old man 's gratitude . Where 's our pay ? This is it . I 've wanted this for a while now ! He said he 'd give it to us because of Mikuru-chan ! You made us do all that work just for the sake of getting that ? Let 's decorate the clubroom with this in commemoration ! you can wear it whenever you want . I give you permission ! Um ... Err ... Thank you very much . my slumber was once again stolen away by none other than a phone call . Shut up ... Shut up ... Damn it ... Yeah ? Kyon-kun ... Asahina-san ? it 's me . Something terrible has ... If this goes on ... I 'll ... Um ... ? this is Koizumi . Why are you together with Asahina-san ? A slight problem has occurred . Do you think you could come right now ? I 'll go . I 'll go immediately . Asahina-san ! What exactly happened ? Kyon-kun ... I the future ... { originally " ... can 't ... " } I can 't go back to the future ! { originally " ... go back to the future ! " } Fu - { \ alphaHff } Fut - Future ? { Can we time this so each part appears progressively ? } Fu - Fut - { \ alphaHff } Future ? { Can we time this so each part appears progressively ? } Fu - Fut - Future ? { Can we time this so each part appears progressively ? } that 's what happened . We 're currently looping through the same time period over and over again . you said that quite cheerfully . Do you have any idea what you 're saying ? I do . There 's nothing more to it . I was talking to Asahina-san just now . Call me for a meeting too ! I happened to notice that the flow of time lately has felt strange . I guess you can say Asahina-san was the one that discovered it . I was able to confirm something . Confirm what ? We 've experienced a repeat of the same time period many times already . You told me that already . it 's from August 17th to August 31st . We are caged up in an endless summer vacation . It certainly is summer vacation now . endless summer . The world now has lost all its time after September 1st . That 's the reason why Asahina-san is unable to return to the future . I guess that 's only natural . What part of physics argues that a state of " no future " is natural ? Who the hell would believe that ? would believe it . So does that mean that we 're inside something similar to an enclosed space ? that 's not the case . One part of the time continuum has just been cut off . everything will be reset at exactly 2400 hours and we will return to August the 17th again . That 's the process . huh ? since people from the future are involved in this . No . This one has nothing to do with Asahina-san . Then what 's the reason ? Probably Suzumiya-san . She might be unaware of it herself but a part of her must not want summer to end . What the hell ? Does she have some sort of regret ? I believe so . It may very well be the fact that she feels like she still has something left to do during summer vacation . So what do you want me to do ? I would have already resolved it . You look like you 're having fun . I 've finally managed to solve the riddle of déjà vu being left as imprints from past loops . don 't tell me everyone in the world feels it too . It doesn 't look like it . You and I are special cases . Just by being close to Suzumiya-san we 've become the only ones capable of feeling it . What about Haruhi ? She isn 't the least bit aware of this ? It doesn 't look like it . Things would probably be a lot more complicated if she did . with the déjà vu I 'm thinking that there must be someone who has retained all of his or her memories of the repeated time . That sounds like some kind of conspiracy talk . And who would that " someone " be ? I think you 'll know without me having to say it . The Integrated Data Sentient Entity 's human interface for example ? Nagato is this true ? Yes . Do you remember everything ? Yes . how many times have we been " reset " ? five hundred and thirteenth time . five hundred and thirteenth time ? 513 ? what are you talking about ? Are you serious ? Yes . So we did the same thing over and over again each and every one of those times ? That is not necessarily the case . That means ... 513 iterations 391 times 054 times . Obon minus the goldfish catching occurred 437 times . 031 times . there have been six variations ... Besides distributing balloons answered calls ... that 's enough . 513 times . That 's what Nagato said . Times the 2 weeks is ... about 594 years . { Kyon can 't do maths . Should be 596 ! } living it over and over again while retaining her memories ? just how does it feel to have lived through all this ? I wonder if they 're there ? Huh ? Martians . I don 't really want them to be there . They might just be a timid people that live underground . They 're probably a friendly bunch . There 's no way that could happen . I 'm bored . Let 's look for UFOs ! anyway ? I wonder about about that too . this problem will be relatively straightforward to solve . why don 't we try this out for starters ? Suddenly hug Suzumiya-san from behind I love you " . And who 's doing that ? There 's no one more suitable than you . I exercise my right to veto . I won 't do it even if beaten to death . I guess so ... Shall I do it instead then ? I 'm kidding . I 'm not qualified for that role . That would only put Suzumiya-san into an unnecessary state of confusion . Nagato . Even before you talked to Asahina-san right ? Yes . So why did you keep quiet about it ? My mission is to observe . I see . I did it ! Look ! I got a home run ! Yay ! I did it ! I did it ! And we continued to move on . We even went to a real fireworks show . too . { is this right ? } { where is this one ? } { and this one ? } bowling karaoke and movies . I knew that this still wouldn 't satisfy Haruhi yet I didn 't make an effort to do something about it . the remaining days of summer drained away realistically . the final day arrived ... August 30th . we 've pretty much completed our summer plans . I wonder if it 's okay like this ? But ... I guess that 's it . do any of you want to do anything else ? it 's fine then . so it 's probably enough . this isn 't fine . You aren 't supposed to be satisfied yet . let 's call it a day then . I 'll let you have tomorrow off to prepare for school . just take a good rest until then . Let 's meet in the clubroom the day after tomorrow . Wait . Haruhi ! This isn 't good . If you go home ... those ten thousand something repeats ... Those two weeks will end up repeating again forever ! But what should I do ? What should I say ? There should be hints in Haruhi 's words . But what are they ? ! What did she say up until now ? It 's no use . I don 't know . Wait . Wait ! Haruhi . Thank you very much ! August 31st . Homework : unfinished . I don 't care anymore . happens . If it really does repeat again doing this homework would be meaningless . I 'll just leave it to myself to figure it out then .

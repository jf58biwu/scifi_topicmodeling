 - my brother joseph and i have had two families . The first one ... Well , let 's just say it didn 't work out too well . But over the years , we made ourselves a new one . And it was to this family , alof you , That his heart really belonged . You see ... A family is something that joseph and i needed . It offered us protection From the outside world ... A world that never understood or appreciated What makes us different . There are others like us out there ... In the shadows , in the light . Each grasping for meaning in a world That won 't accept them for who they really are . They , like us , are blessed , Gifted with extraordinary abilities . And they , like us , struggle with finding their place In an ordinary world . Haunted by their past ... From those who would harm them And keep them from their destiny . Every one of them deserves a chance To be who they really are , But to what end , For what purpose ? Here in this place , We offer salvation . We offer hope . We offer redemption . And one by one , They will come to our side , To our family , And they will find their way home . And all who have gathered will be strong . And all who have gathered Will stand in unison . I say it 's time We found our way back home again . Find your way home , brother . - you must be my new roommate . - yeah , i guess i am . i 'm claire . - hi. i 'm annie . It 's nice to finally meet you , claire . - you too . - the school , um , they wouldn 't really Send any information . Otherwise , i would have friended you on facebook . - oh , that 's my fault . I always check those little privacy boxes for some reason . - i did that same thing with my ap classmate 's profile After i got a b-plus in ap physics . - no , i 'm not in advanced placement . I got my g.e.d. It 's not because i dropped out or anything , I was just traveling . - and you got into this school with a g.e.d. ? What do your parents do ? - uh , my mom breeds championship show dogs , And my dad works for the government . - so that 's how you got in with a g.e.d. - no , i just got really good scores . - oh . Well , you 'll probably place In fenton 's linear algebra class then today . - today ? - he only takes 35 students a semester , And the placement test is today at 1 : 00 . You get in and it pretty much Sets the whole dominoes into motion , you know ? So , um , what 's your plan for graduate school ? - i don 't really have one . Guess it 's kind of why i 'm here . - no , you have to go to college with a plan . How are you gonna find our future without a map ? - you have a map of your future ? - yeah . See , i call this my trajectory . This is me in three years , graduating magna cum laude In poli-sci pre-law , this is me in eight years , Massachusetts attorney general , And this is me in 12 years , Being sworn in as the youngest governor in u.s. history . - wow , you really thought that through . - don 't you think it 's time you put childish things Behind you and thought this through yourself , claire ? I mean , don 't let g.e.d. be a lifestyle choice . I 'll tell you what . If you want , i 'll help you make your own trajectory . It can be our project . - sounds great . - dispatch , this is unit 5-9 . We are 12 blocks out . we 're on it . - on it ? - we 're on it . - look at this parking lot . We 're not going anywhere in this mess . - oh , you 're right . - what are you doing ? - i 'm gonna hoof it . - you 're crazy . we 're 12 blocks away . You 'll never make it . - hesam , i grew up out here . there 's always a shortcut . - hi . i 'm here to save you . - roomie . Hey , claire . Hey. hi . - sorry . - i 'm so excited . You know , if you pass this test , Then we 're gonna be in class together . You and i are gonna keep each other on our tippy toes . But , um ... Please don 't think of this as a competition , okay ? This is about sisterhood . - yay. sisterhood . - okay . This is a placement test for linear algebra 170 . 35 of you geniuses will be lucky enough To get in this class . The rest , you can try next semester . You each have 45 minutes To solve this equation . Please show your work . Is this a joke ? - i know , it 's so easy . Are you sweating ? - no . No , it 's just a little hot in here . - where are you going ? - this class isn 't for me . - there he is . So that pregnant woman ? - uh-huh ? - heard she delivered twins . Named them both peter . - the pregnant woman 's name is kristy . And she had twin girls . thank you . Named them haylie and katie . - yeah , yeah , yeah . Hey , they 're still up in neonatal . You know , you should stop by . They 'd like to thank you in person . - i 'm good . What ? - you single-handedly saved three lives . If it was me , i 'd be floating on cloud nine right now . - i am . - well , you could have fooled me . What 's going on with you ? - if i would have showed up 30 seconds later , That woman , her babies- - they 'd be dead . It 's too close , man . I 've gotta be faster . - dude , you got there faster than humanly possible . If i was a religious man , i 'd think it was a miracle . - a miracle ? Catch you tomorrow . - well , hang on . where are you going ? - took on a shift . - we just got off a double . - yeah , i know , but james is sick . I figured i 'd cover for him . - too late , jackson 's already covering . Dude , there 's a life outside this place . Now me and some of the guys are going out , Houlihan 's still open , come with us . - i 'm good , man . i 'll see you tomorrow . Have fun . See you tomorrow . - i take it you 've seen the paper this morning . All four worked in building 26 , danko 's men . These are revenge killings . And we both know it 's tracy strauss . - i 'm sure it won 't be long Before she makes her way up that list to me . - or nathan . Which is exactly why you 're gonna stop Dragging your feet and pull the trigger On this operation . It 's been six weeks , noah . I 've given you time to put your personal life in order . And nathan says you 're avoiding his phone calls . - by nathan , you mean sylar , right ? - we 've been over this , noah . It 's all working exactly as planned . - as planned ? what plan ? - we had no other choice . Matt parkman had to turn sylar into nathan , And as i recall , you were in on it . - i made an emotional decision Because i didn 't want to see you lose your son , But it was wrong . For 50 years , The company avoided emotions for good reason . I can barely look him in the eye Knowing who 's under that skin . - then don 't . Just do your job to get the company up and running . You 're supposed to be the man with the plan , remember ? - i 'm not sure i 'm that guy anymore . - why is that ? - because i 've lost my family , angela . If you 'll excuse me , Today is claire 's first day of college And i 'm already late , which doesn 't help the situation . Danko . - it appears tracy strauss just paid you a visit . What i can 't figure out is how she survived . I put a bullet in her myself . She shattered into a thousand pieces of ice . - ice melts . I 'm gonna take a wild guess ... That your being here isn 't a coincidence . - i 'm here ... To offer a solution to our mutual problem . You and i kill tracy strauss before she kills us . - last time i made a deal with you , You tried to stab me with a syringe . - fair enough . - i 'm thinking you 're next on her list . - that makes us both wanted men . - so what are you doing here ? You ought to be hiding under a rock somewhere . - just because the government stopped hunting these people Doesn 't mean i have . I hear you and the petrellis , You 're going back into business to do just that . - no , you heard wrong . I 'm not in that business anymore . I 'm changing careers . - what did you do , grow a conscience ? - time to cash out . Start over . - guys like us ... We don 't start over . - i 'm not like you . - she 's coming back for you . You know that , right ? I guess you 're on your own . - i guess i am . - no , thank you . - you made the right call . Cheerleaders are a very subversive group . You don 't wanna mix with that crowd . - no , thanks . I used to be one of them . - oh , so you know . - i do . um , were you ? You weren 't a cheerleader , were you ? - um , no . I--i tried out , but i didn 't make the team . They said that my cheers sounded more like taunts . - yeah , that 's not good . - uh , i 'm gretchen berg . who are you ? - i 'm claire bennet . - oh , hi , claire bennet . So where are you from ? - kind of all over the place . Uh , been in southern california for a while , But texas originally , odessa . - really ? - mm-hmm . - i 'm from austin . - oh , small world . - wait , you 're not that claire bennet , are you ? - which claire bennet would that be ? - murder at union wells in odessa claire bennet . - you heard about that ? - a cheerleader in texas gets her head sawed off At the homecoming game ? Yeah , i 've heard about that . - you know , i kind of want to keep the whole Murder at union wells on the d-l . - no kidding . I mean , if i were you , i would change my name . Like now . They 'd probably let you do it over the phone . - no , they won 't . i would know . I changed my name for a while . - oh. why did you change it back ? - ' cause i wanted to be claire bennet again . I thought people might forget . - no , girl . google 's your enemy . - i , uh , i have to take care of something . Nice to meet you . - you too . - what have you done to me , mom ? Took me a half hour to get here . I 'm sorry . where are my manners ? You look lovely as usual . - miss petrelli , we 're here . - thank you , alfred . - what have you done to me ? Took me a half an hour to get here . I 'm sorry . where are my manners ? You look lovely . As usual . You okay , mom ? - yeah . I 'm just , um- - I 'm worried about the company , that 's all . I 'm worried that noah might be wavering . He 's been very distracted lately . - i 'll talk to him , don 't worry . Do i like sushi ? - you 're the one who had a craving for yellowtail . I wanted italian . - it 's interesting . - life . it 's all about new horizons . It keeps you from getting stale . - exactly . You know , these last couple of weeks I 've been taking stock of a lot of things . I feel like there 's a lot of ... I don 't know , mom . Guess there 's a lot of change going on with me . - really ? - yeah . - how so ? - i don 't know . It 's like when i look back on my life , It just seems like it 's not my life i 'm looking back on . Does that make any sense ? - self-reflection . Happens when you hit 40 , Along with all sorts of other unpleasant surprises . - i 'm being serious , mom . Look at the person i 've been , the kind of father . The kind of brother . The kind of son to you . - you 've been just fine under the circumstances . - no . I have been a jackass . But i 'm gonna change all that . I 'm gonna reconnect with everybody in my life Who 's important , and this time , I 'm gonna be a better me . - okay , nathan . You have a big , important , stressful life . And it 's bound to get confusing . And a man your age starts to feel his own mortality . - that 's just it . I don 't feel mortal . I feel invincible . - it 's midlife crisis . that 's all this is . Here 's my suggestion . You go out and you get yourself a big expensive sports car And a younger woman with questionable morals . That 's what your father did , and it worked for him . What would i be without you ? - i 'm gonna get the phone , okay ? Yeah . - detective parkman . Angela petrelli . - i told you never to call me . - we have a problem . - what kind of problem ? - that thing you did six weeks ago . - you mean when you and bennet strong-armed me Into playing god , that thing ? - i think sylar 's beginning to emerge again . - that 's because he is sylar . - no , you made sylar go away When you turned him into my son . I saw you do it . - okay , then why the hell are you calling me ? - because you need to fix it . You need to patch it up , upgrade it , Whatever it is you do . - how exactly ? - you go back into his mind and erase his memory again . That 's what you do . - no , not anymore . i stopped . Look , ever since that day , I have felt like something got inside of me And i can 't get it out . I started seeing things and i--i 've stopped , okay ? I 'm done. i 'm out . - there 's no such thing as out , detective . Not for people like us . - yeah , speak for yourself . - i 'm telling you , sylar could emerge at any minute . Are you telling me you are not willing To fix our problem ? - this is not our problem . this is your problem . So ... Good luck with it . - and honestly , i 'm sure she could be A really above-average student if she just applied herself . - claire . - hey , you made it . - yeah , i 'm sorry i 'm late . I was having a little problem with my car . And annie was just , um , catching me up . - oh , she was ? - so i 'll see you at the mixer tonight . i hear they have guitar hero 3 set up down there . and well , i sort of excel at guitar hero 3 , So , um , consider yourself served . It was very nice to meet you , mr. bennet . - you too . - so annie was catching you up . - maybe you can , uh , take that algebra class next semester . - but see , that is probably The least interesting part of my day . - how so ? - i was recognized as a survivor Of the homecoming massacre back in odessa . Well , my name was . - i 'm sorry . You know , maybe changing your name Back to bennet wasn 't such a great idea after all , But they say college is for reinventing yourself . - i don 't want to pretend to be anyone but me . I just wanna be claire bennet , daughter of noah bennet . You know , annie asked me today what my dad did for a living . And i actually told her the truth . Ish . I told her you worked for the government , but still . And i like telling the truth . What if my way of reinventing myself Is by telling the truth ? - ish . - ish . - maybe not the whole truth . - the whole truth . - no . just be careful , sweetheart . - all right , lydia . Show me who he is . - his name is danko . Emile danko . - you wanted to see me , sam . - i have a favor to ask of you , edgar . - can 't you send someone else this time ? - i 'd take it as a compliment to your unique skills . - well , what you said this morning About redemption- - i 'm hoping that 's possible . All of this . - yes , well , i left out the part about vengeance . That 's where he comes in . - but i 've only killed when i 've absolutely had to . - the line 's been crossed . They crossed it , not us . I need you to go to him , get the compass back , And the kill the son of a bitch . That 's what joseph would have wanted . - well , joseph 's not here anymore . - i 'm sorry . I won 't ask you again after this one . I promise . - and here i was thinking that i 'd be the one That got away . - no . You 're just number five . - you know , five 's my lucky number . - mm . - or it used to be . Is it still lucky ? - i haven 't decided yet . - i saw you break into a thousand pieces , And yet here you are . That is a neat trick . - it wasn 't a trick . I felt myself shatter . Melting ... And then all those pieces of me came floating back together With one cohesive thought . Killing all of you . - okay , now see , that 's the part that i don 't get . Because i don 't think that you 're really a killer . That 's not who you are . - no , that 's all i am . You took the rest away from me . - i can help you get your life back . - how ? danko said that he wouldn 't stop Until i was killed . - what if i could make it so that danko Wasn 't interested in you anymore ? - why do you want to do this for me ? - 20 years of bagging and tagging And i never helped ... A single one of you . Maybe we 're both looking for redemption . What do you say ? Is it a deal ? - mm . I bet you wish it was that easy . - i got your phone call . Change your mind about tracy strauss ? - no . I came here to change yours . - sorry . i 'm gonna kill her . Even if i have to suck her up in a wet vac to do it . She murdered four of my men . She 's a killer . - i 'm recommending that you let this thing go . You said guys like us never start over . I 'm offering you a chance to do just that . Consider it a permanent vacation Courtesy of the u.s. government . - not interested . - not acceptable . I want you to forget about tracy strauss . - well ... we all want things , bennet . - and i 'm gonna get what i want . - hey , this is peter . leave a message . Get back to you when i can. thanks . - look , i 've left you- - I 've left you three messages . You need to call me back . Something 's happening to me And i think you 're the only person Who 's gonna understand what it is . It 's , uh ... Just call me . Please . - who the hell are you ? - you know exactly who i am . - they sent you to get it back . - he made you forget . - what did you say ? - it 's not worth it . - who are you ? - you took something from us . Now i 'm gonna get it back . - you 're never gonna find it . - oh ? I think i will . - hey . - hi . Uh ... I 'm sorry if i freaked you out with that whole , uh , Murder at union wells thing . I just--it was so scandalous and i got excited . - no. no , no , no . don 't apologize . It was just weird talking about it Because i was never allowed to talk about it before . - so what , you pretended like it didn 't happen ? - no , i just kept trying to start my life over And i thought i could take what i liked about Who i was and leave all the other stuff behind . - whoo ! yeah ! that is how you play guitar hero . Claire ! hey , come on , over here ! You and me . You have been served . come on ! - who is she ? She 's horrible . She 's been hogging the thing all night . - that would be my roommate . - come on , we 're up . - i was gonna play with gretchen . - does gretchen know how to play ? - no , but gretchen doesn 't care . - your opponent 's supposed to raise your game , Not lower it . - well , since neither one of us know what we 're doing , We 'll be on even playing fields . This is gonna be really bad . Oh , i got one . Yellow . Yes. yes ! - oh , no . - i must be getting better every second . - hiro. hiro . Hiro ! hiro , hiro . - hiro . Hiro . hiro ! - hiro . Hiro ! - who is he ? - his name is hiro . hiro nakamura . And he was here at the carnival . - when ? how long ago ? - 14 years . - thank you , lydia . That 's all for now . - are we really going to stop moving After all these years ? - it 's time . yes . Listen ... I know you 're weak . But i need you to try and do it one more time . For me . I think we found someone who can help us fix the past . - that 's good news , samuel . - yes . So ... I need you to send me back . - how far ? - 14 years . - hey , i didn 't see you leave the party . Guess you 're still there . And you left the windows open . - ah . - matty . Matty ! Matty . Matty , are you hiding again ? Where 's matty ? - hi , daddy . I want my body back . - you put him down . please . - oh , poor daddy . He looks pretty scared , huh ? Can you say " freaking out " ? - i don 't- - i don 't understand . How are you even here ? - i 'm part of you , matt . Whatever you did to me , i held on , And now i 'm inside your head . - so you 're not real ? - then how could i be holding your little boy ? - just put him down . Not until you give me what i want . You did something to me , to my mind . That 's why i 'm here . Tell me what you did . what did you put in my body ? - okay , just put him down and then we 'll talk about this . - tell me . - matt ? - here comes mommy . Catch . - no ! - matt , are you okay ? - yeah . I thought i heard him crying , that 's all . - matt , he 's fast asleep . - what 's going on with you ? - i 'm just tired , i guess . - come back to bed . - hello ? - i must have dialed the wrong number . - who were you looking for ? - sandra ... Bennet . - yeah , she 's here . Hang on . Sandra ! - hello ? Hello ? - sandra ? - no. no , this is tracy . - i didn 't do it . - what have you got to lose , hiro ? - do i know you ? - the name 's samuel , And i think we 're gonna be great friends . - did your roommate express any suicidal thoughts , Feelings of being overwhelmed , Low self-esteem ? - no . No , if anything , she had too much self-esteem . She was an overachiever . She loved herself . - that 's not the impression she left in her suicide note . - what suicide note ? - this was on her pillow . - no , it wasn 't . - it may have been something you overlooked . - no , i distinctly remember being impressed With how crisp her pillowcase was And that there wasn 't a suicide note . This wasn 't there . - would you get them out of here ? You said she was an overachiever ? - look , even an overachiever can 't write a suicide note After she 's dead . She wouldn 't do this . she was just beating the entire floor 's butt at guitar hero . This was not a suicide . - what , then ? murder ? Why would someone want to murder your roommate ? - i don 't know . isn 't that your job ? - yep , it sure is . Thanks for your help , miss bennet . - so you 're a time traveler ? - yes . how did you know that ? - i have a gift , hiro . Just like you . - oh . What are you doing here ? I 'm thinking it has something to do With that young man . Is he you ? - yes , but i cannot interfere . - why not ? - because this is where it starts , How i become the master of time and space . If i interfere , i will never become a hero . I won 't save the cheerleader , And new york will explode . It 's the butterfly effect . - hmm . that would be bad . - but i bet there 's some butterflies That you could change . I mean , why not make this trip worthwhile ? - no , you can never change the past . It 's bad , always . Everything is connected . - not everything . Sometimes , if you want to change one thing , That 's all you do . Change one thing . You have a rare gift , hiro , To right the wrongs of your life . Isn 't there anything else you 'd care to fix ? - the slushy incident ! That was all my fault . I bumped into ando and made him spill his drink All over kimiko 's favorite dress . That is the reason why she started to hate him . - now 's your chance to make them happy . You have the power . - no. i have a code to never change the--aah ! - there are things in this world that are wrong , hiro . You can make them right . If you master these skills , You and i will have a bright future together . - you and me ? i don 't understand . - you just need to take a chance . - danko and i , we were just talking in the hall . The next thing i know , he 's dead , And this guy is on me . I got lucky . I mean , this whole water thing , It just--it kicked in on instinct . - what are you doing here , tracy ? I wanted you to leave danko to me . - i couldn 't just let it go . I didn 't know if i could trust you to deal with him . This is my life . I needed to know . When i got here , i saw that you did what you promised . He didn 't know me ... So i figured , just live and let live . And as i was leaving , this guy- the guy with the knives ? - he was fast . Scary fast . Definitely one of us . One of me . - you have no idea why he 'd want to kill danko ? - i think i heard him say he was looking for something . I don 't know . maybe it was revenge . Danko made a lot of enemies . - this wasn 't revenge . Look at the wounds . They were all to the stomach . If it were me , and i was looking for revenge , I 'd go for the jugular Or the carotid artery or the heart . No , i think you heard right . I think the killer was looking for something . - that 's personal . - and i think i found it . - what is that ? - a key . - to what ? - that 's a good question . - come on , matty-man , you can do it . Show me you 're a big boy . Oh ! oh , look at you ! - did you see that ? - all right . - good job. i got him . I got him . good job , dude . God , he usually takes so much longer To warm up to strangers . - oh , roy 's not a stranger . He 's been delivering water to us Since matty was born . - i can 't believe it 's been that long . Time flies , huh , janice ? - yeah . - yeah , it sure does . Whoa ! - listen , the heating unit on your cooler is busted . I 'll swing by later to fix it . - thanks , roy . - yeah. thanks , roy . - no problem . - bye . - bye . - what ? - janice ? - that 's my name . - no , your name is mrs. parkman . Look , when i delivered water , We were professional . - you never delivered water . - pizza , water , whatever . that 's not the point . The point is ... He was here , i wasn 't , and i 'm just a little pissed . - i thought we were past that . - yeah . Yeah , we are . i 'm sorry . - hey , you 're tired . You haven 't been sleeping properly . - well , i 've been snoring a lot less , so ... - i 'm worried about you . - it 's just work . I--i got a lead on this huge drug ring , And all i need is the name of the supplier . - and if you could read a few minds , - yeah , but i told you , i 'm not yodoing that anymore , right ? I kicked that for good . - i know , and i 'm proud of you . I 'm just worried that it 's taking a toll . - don 't worry . - i-i got this under control . - hello , peter . Can we talk for a minute ? - can i get you something to drink ? - yeah , thanks . Love what you 've done with the place . - thank you . So i have water or mustard . - water is good . So what have you been up to ? - i got my old job back . Paramedic . - hmm . - yeah . - it must be keeping you busy . Your mother says she hasn 't seen you in weeks . Wow , this is amazing . is this all you ? - mm-hmm . - are you using powers ? - well , in my line of work , it helps to be , uh ... Strong , agile . - incident , 23rd and- thank you , dr. suresh . It 's a pretty convenient power . - good for you . - i figure one of us has got to make up for all we 've done . - meaning- you , me , my family , the company . Come on , we haven 't exactly been model citizens , noah . - it 's a pretty heavy burden for one guy . - you said you wanted to talk . - yeah . Danko 's dead . Killed because of this . - a key ? - i did some research . This key opens a safe deposit box In a downtown bank . Now the way i figure it , The guy that killed danko is probably just waiting For whoever shows up with this key . I need a partner on this , somebody i can trust . He could jump me just about anywhere , And i 'd never know what hit me , 'cause he 's super fast and he has a thing for knives . - how fast ? - thanks for letting me stay with you . - of course. i would never leave you here . Not after what happened . - annie 's parents came by last night . I thought they should know about the supposed suicide letter . - you didn 't say anything , did you ? - no , but i think they have the right to know , don 't you ? I mean , if it were me , you would want to know . - it 's not your business to tell the parents about the note . Let the police handle it . - it 's the truth . - welcome back . - hey. uh , gretchen , this is my mom . Mom , gretchen . - a pleasure . - hi . - bizarre , huh ? I heard you told the cops That you didn 't see a suicide note . So what do you think , murder or horrific accident ? - uh , claire may have been mistaken about the note . - may have been ? did you see one or not ? - well , i didn 't at first , but it was dark . Maybe i missed it . - suicide makes no sense . I mean , the girl had a trajectory . Who maps out their life for the next 50 years And then throws themself out a window ? - i should go . You okay ? - yeah . thanks for everything . - you 're welcome . Remember , new life , new beginning . Bye . nice to meet you . - likewise . - so , it 's murder , right ? How do we prove it ? - so you think your knife guy 's gonna show ? - i don 't know , but it sure makes me feel better Having you around . - yeah , i 'll bet . - do you mind if i make an observation ? I think you should seriously consider How you 're living your life . - where did that come from ? - i saw your apartment , the police scanner , All those newspaper articles . You 're saving lives , and you 're keeping track . I 'll bet you know every one of their names . - and ? - do any of them know yours ? It 's not healthy to live alone , peter . No connections to anybody . it 's a dead end . Trust me . i 'm exhibit " a . " For years , i put my job ahead of my family , And now my kids are off at school And i 'm eating cereal for dinner And a strange man is answering my wife 's phone . My point is i 'm alone . That 's no way to live . - here you are , mr. danko . And i 'll be right outside when you 're finished . - so what 'd we win ? A compass. danko got killed for a compass ? - a broken compass . - hmm . - yeah. we need just another minute . - that doesn 't belong to you . - he has power . - i got it . i got it . - bloody hell . - what happened ? - i don 't know . he took off . He 's still breathing . Thanks a lot , doc . - okay . - how 's he doing ? - oh , he 's recovering . i hope it was worth it . - no , not really . I can 't figure out why danko Thought this was worth dying for . - could i see it ? Whoa ! hello . - what did you do ? - i didn 't do anything . - well , apparently , it only works for you . Here . - no ! no , no , no , no . - peter , this is a lead . You saw that guy. there could be others out there like him . - look , my life finally makes sense to me .

No wonder your wife is having sex with the water guy . - shut the hell up . - i didn 't say anything . - i 'm not talking to you right now . - come on , matt . She 's cheated on you once already , And we both know what janice needs is a real man . Someone who 's not afraid of power .

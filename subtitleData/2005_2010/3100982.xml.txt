Aleksander Cirko , from Berkeley . That was a long time ago . They kicked you off the faculty because ... I found working in academia to be counterproductive . Ah , and who pays the bills now ? A mix of private and public concerns . If we could continue ? No . No more . Not until you tell me what you know and then , like scientists , we collaborate . That 's impossible , Doctor . Why is that ? Because the Institute 's research programs have been suspended indefinitely . What ? The facility is now under jurisdiction of the US Armed Forces .

We 've taken precautionary measures , cordoned off the beach until the carcass can be dealt with , shut down US 17 , cut down on the lookie-loos . We 've got to look out for the interest of the public at large , you know ? PRlCKETT : Authorities claim that the decomposed carcass is a sperm whale that died at sea and drifted to shore . Dad , I 'm gonna call you back . However , some locals are less sure . So what do you think it is ? MAN : Well , isn 't that obvious ? It 's Moby Dick ! PRlCKETT : Whatever it is , whew , it stinks .

Do you have anything tonight ? Um , you better make that two tickets . ClRKO : Ladies and gentlemen . There is some evidence that this is simply a natural phenomenon .

 My name is Jane Vasco I could use you on my team I work for a secret government agency that hunts neuros . People who can do dangerous things with their minds . On my first assignment ... Something a little weird happened , Okay , something really weird . Until I get some answers I 'm getting on with my life , doing my job Stocking up on aspirin because let me tell ya pain 's a bitch ! Wham , bam , thank you ma 'am . You try beating that , my jolly green friend . How do you keep doing that ? You win . Drinks on me . Don 't feel bad . You giving me a better fight than I 've had in a long time . Thank you . Cheers . Blood in your eye . ... Thanks , I think . Is there a storm coming I didn 't hear about ? No storm . Why are they locking the place down ? The beast of bolnar walks from the eighth hour past noon to the ninth . And pity anything which crosses its path . Animal or man . My goat was first , four years ago . No one believed me , they laughed at me . They 're not laughing , now . Dogs , horses , men . Sliced to ribbons and ripped in half by the beast . You 're kidding , right ? Anybody tried hunting it down ? Them that tried all died . Best to stay inside when it is the time of the beast . Come on , another game . double or nothing . You bet . Just a second . Connor . Yeah , be there in half an hour . Sorry , my friend . Have to give you a rain check . Rain check ? I have to leave . You can 't go . It 's the eighth hour . Right . Connor , the beast kill you . I 'll be okay . Ahhhh ! Ahhh ! Ahhh ! Ahhh ! No ! No ! Connor ? What happened ? ! Ah ! Connor ! What happened ! Ahh ! It almost got me ! I don 't know , something . maybe it was the beast . What beast ? What beast ? The beast of bolnar . - It 's okay ! - I got to go ! It 's okay ! You 'll be okay ! Couldn 't find much on " the beast of bolnar . " a few references to a town legend . Similar to bigfoot or the loch ness monster . Animal mutilation , killings . No proof . Hey , last night I was given the mother of all tetanus shots . That 's proof enough for me . I 'm not saying I don 't believe you . As many horror movies as I 've seen ... You 've gotta consider all possibilities . Including a neuro on the loose . We have any reports of neuro activity outside north america ? I knew you were gonna ask that . No The only known neuros this side of the water are housed in this facility . It 's mcbride . Get in here , thank you . I 'll keep checking but the local databases are pretty pathetic . You want facts , talk to people . The guys in that bar knew plenty . - Agent mcbride . - Captain One of my team was attacked last night , in town . It has the earmarks of neuro activity . If it happened in town , it wasn 't a neuro . Not one of ours , anyway . - All the inmates are accounted for ? - Yes , sir Head counts are done on the hour since the administrative change . That will be all , thank you . Alright , connor , put some clothes on , I want you to show me where this happened . It 's mine . I don 't know if I hit it , didn 't take it down . Connor , try to find me a blood trail . Right . Ever see him like that ? Not even close . What is that ? Looks like the claw mark of some animal . Yeah , king kong 's bigger brother . What the hell could do that ? Mark of the beast it is . Beware the eighth hour past noon . Have you ever seen this beast ? No one who sees the beast lives to tell of it . Where does it come from ? Have you no eyes , woman ? The beast comes right out of hell . But there has got to be something ... Connor ? Find that blood trail ? Only my own . Welcome to bolnar . New people in town tend to create a stir . I 'm constable farkas . Andre mcbride . We 're u . S. Federal agents . Really ? That 's a first . What brings u . S. Federal agents all the way to our little town ? One of our colleagues was attacked last night . - Between eight and nine ? - Yeah The beast of bolnar . Trust me I know how it sounds . You have to understand . Two different worlds . - Each has their own rules ... - What 're you saying ? You don 't believe in this beast or not . I 'm saying that there are things here that can 't be explained away with ... " Rational explanations ? " and the beast of bolnar is one of those things ? You already know the answer to that , don 't you ? I know something attacked me last night . Who or what , I don 't know . There could be rational explanations that you are unaware of . Then I 'd be more than happy to hear them . Four years ago , the people in this town elected me , believing that I could help protect them . I haven 't been able to do that . If there 's a chance that we could help each other to meet that end , I 'd like to participate You know the town , you know the people . We can use all the help we can get . That 's the last one . The square 's been sealed off . The streets have been cleared . Except us . If even a cockroach crosses my sensor perimeter , we 'll know about it You 're all keyed into infra red in case we need a heat signature . Lovely. you 're a bloody genius . Five minutes to 8 : 00 . Places - I got the north end . - I 've got the south . Farkas , here . West end . We 're about to discover whether or not science can triumph over mythology . Alright , riley , what do you got ? Not a peep . Wish it would come out and get it over with . Maybe it 's not coming out tonight . The beast comes every night . - It 's almost 8 : 30 and I 've got nothing . - Keep going til 9 : 00 If he knows we 're out here ... With all this brilliant science ... We 're not talking about a he . We 're talking about an it . Still nothing . Looks like a wash . Farkas ? Ahhh ! What 's going on ? Farkas , I 'm on my way . There 's nothing on my screen ! I see something 's got him . what ? I can 't see it . Jane , be careful . Hold your positions , we 're on our way . Check vasco . She 's alright . Good . He 's not . No prints , no fibers . Good thing we stayed up all night . À good man 's dead and all we 've got is a lot of nothing . I 've checked my sensor array and transmitters over and over . Everything 's working perfectly . Except it didn 't work . How was the perimeter compromised ? I can 't explain it . Farkas tried to tell us that this is an it and not a him . Even if this is some kind of beast , it should give off body heat on infra red and anything that moves should set off a motion detector . Only it didn 't . Why ? - I haven 't got a clue . - You better get one , riley . One thing we know for sure , whatever it is , it kills . Whoa , whoa , check this out ! Boss Does that mean the thing 's still here ? I don 't know , I can 't tell , I can 't zoom in any further . Jane ? Connor ? I have it calibrated for a uv 15 overlay . It should work . ) Alright , you sonovabitch , where are you ? Connor , anything ? No ! Guys ! Footprints . How could something so tiny be so strong ? Anything yet ? Yes and no ? Meaning what ? I know what didn 't kill constable farkas . It wasn 't the wounds on his back or the beating he took . Then what was it ? Farkas died from a complete shutdown of his central nervous system . And it was sudden as though someone just flipped a switch . Never seen anything like it . Can you confirm that this is the same thing that attacked connor last night ? Not with absolute certainty but the wound patterns are identical . Boss ... Sorry , go . Got a preliminary analysis of the footprint . Trace electromagnetic energy in and out of it . It wasn 't there before farkas was killed . Okay , it belonged to the killer . What 're we dealing with ? Based on the depth of the print . À female , five-six and 110 pounds . The guy I talked to in the tavern said the beast first attacked four years ago . His goat . So we 're not talking about an ancient legend . We 're talking about a legend that started after nico moved into the neighborhood . Hell of a coincidence . According to newman , whatever killed farkas attacked his central nervous system . You 're damn lucky to be alive . Riley , I want you to delve deeper on this footprint analysis . I 'm going to head back to newman . I still think we 're missing something in the inmate population . You two get back to town and find the guy from the tavern . See what he remembers about this thing 's first kill . Could shed light on how this began and why . Let 's go . Find this . Sorry , I couldn 't come up with more answers for you . That 's alright . It 's to be expected in our line or work . Let me ask you something , doctor ... These detainees , you have been here for a while ... Have you encountered any conditions under which the effects of a chip could wear off ? Encountered it ? No . Is it possible ? Like you said ... " In this line of work ... " no way to be sure . Yes , but look around you . Nico has over a thousand neuros who are not using their powers . And they aren 't all living here in the section for model detainees . I assume these questions stem from the incident in bolnar . Let me say this , agent mcbride . We know that proximity is required for neuro power to have any effect . Bolnar is 25 miles away . The beast of bolnar didn 't appear until after nico was established here . I don 't believe in coincidence , doctor . You 're right , of course . But you might have to consider the possibility that you 're not dealing with a neuro but something altogether different . Well , if it isn 't the dart champion of bolnar . Lot of work I am doing . This won 't take very long . Horvath , something happened to me the night I left the bar . I told you not go , you went anyway . I remember you saying something about your goat was the first thing attacked by this " beast . " torn apart . My name 's jane . We know this beast is dangerous and we want to help your town get rid of it . Can not get rid of . Why not ? Curse of the gypsies . Gypsies ? World war II , many gypsies died here . Gypsies curse bolnar , beast come . World war ii was 60 years ago . How come the beast only showed up four years ago ? I 'm not a gypsy . That 's loud . Church , next door is good , protection from the beast . You said your goat was the first thing attacked . Attack goat , not person . No . Boy must learn . I said , boy needs to learn . Thanks for your time , horvath . Nice class of people you hang around with . He seemed like a good guy in the tavern . Guess that 's why they call it happy hour . Poor kid . Reminds me of the old man . Minus the left hook . - What 've you got ? - Nothing . Horvath doesn 't know how or why it started . Unless you buy the gypsy story . I 'm listening There 's some superstition about a gypsy curse but it doesn 't add up . Actually , farkas thought it did . And something got past riley 's sensors . I think I might have a way to track it using part of the uv frequency that revealed that footprint . Still , thing should 've had an infrared signature . Should have , but didn 't . You sure this will work ? Only one way to find out . Is that it ? That 's it . À mile north of here . Moving twelve miles an hour . We move . You 're our eyes , kid . Got your eyes and my mojo . Riley , eta . Two minutes . Understood . Remember we hit this thing as one . Hey , guys , do you see what I 'm seeing ? Oh , yeah , I see it ! We just don 't know what the hell it is . Hey , guys , do you see what I 'm seeing ? Oh , yeah , I see it ! We just don 't know what the hell it is . Jane , you 've got point . Connor , you move on my mark . 3 ... 2 ... Where 'd it go ? I don 't know . It was on my screen ... Jane ! Behind you ! Vasco ! You okay ? Yeah . Wouldn 't have been if whatever the hell that was didn 't show up . Any history of this thing saving anyone before jane ? Not that I could find . None of the people I spoke to could rember it happening before , either . Yesterday , it snapped her in half . Doesn 't make any sense . Are you wearing perfume ? What ? Pheromones . They 've been known to excite predators . Among others . Other than changing my clothes , I can 't think of anything that made yesterday any different than today . Ahhh ! What kind of prison has frigging cats ? It 's therapeutic . It calms the inmates . Whatever happened to a good smack in the mouth ? You okay ? This remind you of anything ? You don 't need a cut man in your corner ? What 's your point ? These scratches aren 't nearly as linear and parallel as the ones the beast left in town . Or the ones we saw on connor and farkas . What difference does it make ? The beast isn 't a cat . We don 't know what it is . Or isn 't . I 'd like to go back and speak to horvath . Do it . Riley , anything on those footprints ? I 've got a firm handle on the energy signature . If I can enhance it I might be able to produce an image . Something like a mug shot . Sooner than later , riley . Of course . You looking for something ? Yes . I 'm just not sure what it is . I told you everything I know . I know you have . There 's just ... Something here ... Something I 'm missing . I am sorry But I have no time for talking . I have work to do . If I could just have one more second ... Or not . Hi . Let me help you with those . Whoa . You 've really got some muscles there . I can do twenty push-ups . Not bad . More than I can do . Are you ametican ? American . Sorry . My english is not so good . I think your english is very good . Where 'd you learn ? At orphanage . My name is jane , what 's your name ? Kristoff . Kristoff , it doesn 't have to be this way . If you want , I can help you . I have to go . How 's it going ? Tell you in a second . I 'm trying to render an image out of this electrical signature . Fascinating . I 'm hungry , I 'm gonna render a sandwich . You want anything ? This 'll take a while . I 'll come with you . Doesn 't make any sense . How do you " render " a sandwich ? Yes ! So much for turning over a new leaf . It did , actually . Until last night they 'd always been safe inside . I 'd say you could call this a sign of forced entry . I 'll take interviews . They know me . Let 's check this body . Oh , god . Not cut off , either . Ripped . It saves your life one day , overkill the next . Think we 're affecting the pattern simply by looking for the killer ? Wish I knew . I suppose we should find the rest of them . Much as I hate to pass that up . Horvath has a son . Someone needs to check up on him ... Let him know what 's happened ... See if he 's okay . Alright , I 'll find the head myself . Kristoff ? Kristoff , it 's jane . Kristoff ? Where are you ? Hi . There 's something I have to tell you . - I 'm not allowed to talk to you . - Why not ? The mister said . The mister ? Your father ? Told me never to call him that . Why aren 't you supposed to talk to me ? I don 't know . But if I talk to you , the mister will send me back to orphanage . Kristoff , listen to me . There 's something I have to tell you , something sad . The mister isn 't coming back . Because I was bad ? No , kristoff , you 're not bad , he is bad . To do this to you . To hurt you . Do this to me because I was bad . - Now he 's left me . - He didn 't leave you . He died . I 'm so sorry . I go back to the orphanage , aren 't I ? I 'm not going to let anything bad happen to you . Okay ? No , you 'll go , too . Everybody goes and leaves . I won 't go until I 'm sure you 're taken care of . Have you had breakfast today ? No . I 'll see what 's in the kitchen . Eggs , bacon and potatoes . That 's what I make the mister every morning . Well , you wash up . Today , I 'll make breakfast for you . Just trying to get you guys on the comm . I 've got positron emission tomography of the beast of bolnar . Have a look . Given that you guys don 't believe in monsters , I ran it against the inmate population . There 's a 91 percent match to one of them . Gabriella flanagan . I don 't know what you want me to tell you . The truth ! I 've been telling you the truth . Tell me . I 've never hurt anyone in my whole life . If you don 't count robbing people blind . I 'm not saying I shouldn 't be here . I stole and that was wrong and I 'm paying for it . But you said people have been killed . I 'd never do that . There 's a town called bolnar . You been there ? No . I never even heard of it . Argh ! You were seen . Can you explain that ? No , it 's a mistake . I 've been here for ten years . Lady , you 're gonna die here unless you tell us what we want to know . I don 't know anything . I don 't . Why won 't you believe me ? That 's the best damn liar I 've ever seen . Or she 's telling the truth . You saw that thing on riley 's computer . It looks just like her . She 's a model detainee . Never caused any problems . How do you explain it ? Seriously , boss , just gimme ten more minutes with her . Please . No . Find dr . Newman and have him run every test in the book on her . Alright . I don 't know what you 're expecting to find . Even if I did find something , gabriella 's " talent " was that she could see through solid objects . She didn 't tear people apart . I understand that . But if her power were somehow to mutate , change form . That 's a big " if . " besides , gabriella flanagan is still chipped and the chip is functioning . You 're positive . Agent mcbride , right now , this woman is no more a neuro than you or I. Kristoff Breakfast is ready . - Vasco . - Jane , it 's riley . You still at horvath 's ? * Yeah , I think I found something , too . Whatever this is , it 's somehow connected to this place . You 've gotta get out of there ! In a minute Tell andre those aren 't claw marks . Listen to me ! The beast is on the move . And it 's heading right for you . In broad daylight ? All I know is , it 's headed toward horvath 's and it 's moving fast . Jane ! Jane ! Kristoff . Kristoff , wake up . Kristoff , wake up . Wake up ! Kristoff , it 's alright . May I see that ? There 's no doubt about it . No doubt about what ? I 've found the beast of bolnar . You mean we found her , gabriella flanagan . Yes , and no . When gabriella flanagan came here ten years ago , she was pregnant . She had a child who was then transferred to an orphanage . Kristoff . I 've confirmed that with dna . I 've also confirmed that the boy is a neuro . Doc , what 're you saying ? That this freakazoid gene can be inherited ? It would appear to be . This is the first we 've seen it . Doesn 't make any sense , gabriella 's ... Apparently , the inherited ability can be different from the mother . I don 't buy it . If the kid did all this , why does it look like her ? Right now , I can only give you a best guess . The boy ... - His name is kristoff . - Kristoff 's unconscious mind seems to have created an entity , a creature from the id , so to speak , that carried all of his rage . And there was a lot of that to go around . Kristoff was adopted at the age of five for little more than slave labor . He 's nine , right ? The beast of bolnar appeared four years ago . Apparently , kristoff didn 't even know what he was doing . The entity created itself during a specific portion of rem sleep which turned out to occur ... Between 8 : 00 and 9 : 00 p . M. When the church bell sounded , it would wake him up or interrupt the rem sleep . Like it did today . Think about it . You 're kristoff , getting worked half to death by a man who offers zero comfort or warmth . Deep down you 're mad as hell . I still don 't get it . Why does it look like his mother ? He shouldn 't even be able to rember her . Yes , he does . In his mind , she 's the only protector he 's ever known . Until you helped him . That 's why his monster saved you . When the kid went to sleep again , why didn 't the monster show up ? Most of us only experience rem sleep once or twice per sleep cycle . The deepest level is usually the first . Son of the neuro . Sounds like a horror movie . Although , sequels usually suck . There was ... Riley , shut up . If this is true , then the neuro ability can spread through genetics , we could be in for one hell of a party . I 'm afraid that 's a strong possibility . If you 'll excuse me , I have a report to write up . I guess the circus is gonna be in town for a long time . Look at the bright side . You will never be out of work . * Trust me , boss , if we could take the last of these freaks off the planet , I 'd he happy to collect my unemployment check . Well , if you 'll excuse me , there 's a freak that needs some attention . I 've spoken with the new director and it 's all arranged ... You 'll never have to go back to that orphanage . And you 'll stay with me ? Kristoff ... I can 't . I have my work to do . But I do know someone that can stay with you . And I 've spoken to her . And she 's missed you Every day of your life . And , kristoff , There 's nothing better Than being with your mother . Go on , you 'll be okay . Will I see you again ? Of course .

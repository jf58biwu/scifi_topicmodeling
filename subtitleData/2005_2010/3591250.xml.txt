When we got here , Becky was all invisible , And that rod , like--like , went through your body , But it 's , like , you 're totally fine now . - seriously ? I just saw the two of you get attacked By a pack of wild dogs . Oh , my god . Those water bottles they gave us , I bet they were drugged . - yeah , I just saw you two making out . I think you 're right . drugged . - oh , my god . - let 's just keep it between us , though . We don 't want the sisters to know that they got to us . - right . - exactly . - see ? Problem solved . - I thought our problem Was a homicidal invisible girl . - are you okay ? - no . Actually , I 'm not okay .

Being in the passenger seat of your own life . - where the hell are we going , anyway ? - New York . - New York . what for ? - the last thing I remember is Peter Petrelli Stabbing me in the neck with a syringe . I figure the Italian eagle scout Should know what happened next . Unless of course you want to save us the trouble And just tell me what happened to my body . - that 's not gonna happen . - suit yourself . I don 't get to fly very often , you know ? Especially not first class . - well , I 'm glad my life savings Could broaden your horizons . [ alarm buzzes ] - code blue . Gate 37. code blue .

I 'm a cop ! - final boarding call for flight ... - I 'm sorry , Lydia . A situation 's come up . I don 't really have a choice in the matter . Made a bit of a mess . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to clean it up . - a bit of a mess ? Sounds to me like the Claire Bennet recruitment Is a lost cause . - well , you know me . I 'm the patron saint of lost causes . - this is a lost cause . - no . there 's got to be something . - there 's nothing . Nothing about Becky Taylor , Or why she wants me dead . - or why she killed Annie . - right . Let 's not forget that she already succeeded In killing one of your roommates . Awesome . - I should go to the sorority house And go into her room , Go through her stuff . I 'll find answers there . - what if you find Becky instead ? Or what if she 's here right now ? Wanting to kill me ... Invisibly . - uh ... There are ways to make her visible . Huh ? See ? Nothing . - maybe I should go with you ? - no . No , just stay here . It 'll be safer . And don 't let anyone in the room Until I get back , okay ? - okay . - you 'll be fine . Lock the door . [ loud , indistinct chatter ] - thank you . - do you work here ? Know how to keep pressure on a wound ? Do you know how to keep pressure on a wound ? Good . now do not let up . Can you do that for me ? all right .

Come on , people . don 't crowd me . You understand the meaning of " seriously injured " ? 'cause I can happen to give you a hands-on example . If an old lady like me can move her ass , I 'm sure you can too . There you go . That 's what I 'm talking about . Nice job , guys . thank you . - [ gasping ] - watch the glass . watch the glass . - why would I want to be dressed as a pirate ? - because everyone will be dressed as wenches , And you won 't stand out . And don 't worry . You can totally be a slutty pirate . - ooh . Oh , hey , Claire . - hey . - uh , a little late for party prep , aren 't we ? - have you guys seen Becky Since she kidnapped us ? - since she what ? - since she kidnapped us . For the scavenger hunt . - oh , there 's gonna be a scavenger hunt ? - you guys don 't remember anything . - huh ? - okay , um ... - that was fast . - my daughter calls , I drop everything . - [ laughs ] I mean , the luck we 're having today , huh ? Wow , 4 1 / 2 hours at the airport , Trying to talk your way out of that airport jail , Only to still be on the no-fly list . And now this . - how did I not see that huge chunk of metal In the middle of the road ? - maybe I made it so you didn 't see it . [ metal clangs ] Oh , man , I could get used to this- - Playing the bad guy , the saboteur . - do you have any upper-body strength at all ? - actually , I 'm deceptively strong .

Hey , Hank . - yeah ? - hey . Hey ! - whoo ! you 're right . Deceptively strong . - you just killed him . - no , I didn 't . You did . - okay , let 's go over the rules . - I 'm pretty clear from our phone conversation What the rules are . - well , recap for me . - we make all the bad stuff go away , like this Becky ... - man on the floor . - and you get to keep all the good stuff , Like your new friend Gretchen . am I right ? - close enough . - I will do my best , Claire , But life isn 't always that simple . Let me get inside the room And see what I can find . - it 's that one on the end . - okay. all right , Claire , why don 't you Go on back to the dorm , back to your friend ? - I 'm coming with you , Claire . - what ? no. no , no , no . We just went over the rules . Don 't you remember what the rules are ? You are not supposed to wipe Gretchen 's memory . - she must be a really good friend . - dad , just--please . - he 's not going to erase Gretchen 's memory . He 's going with you so that if Becky comes near , She won 't be able to stay invisible . Okay ? - oh . That 's actually a really good plan . - this is not my first rodeo . - thanks , dad . - we 'll regroup soon . - come on , rene . - he was helping you . - exactly . In his death , He has helped me prove a point about the line . - what line ? - the one I can cross and you can 't . The one that says I can do anything I want , Like killing people in cold blood . - no , you can 't just- the world is my hostage , Matt . Anybody . Anytime . So no more sabotage , okay ? Because I 'm the one that 's in control here . Do you understand me ? I 'm sorry . I don 't think I heard you . - yes . I understand you . - good . - [ breathing heavily ] Hey . I 'm ... fine . I 'm fine . I can 't ... Too many people need help . This power , it keeps draining out of me , And then it comes back , And then it drains out of me again . - maybe you shouldn 't use it anymore . - and be ordinary ? I got to get back in there . [ exhales ] Thanks . Hey , you know , they could use your help . Earlier I saw you with the , uh , suture . Where 'd you learn how to do that ? - clown college . - clown college . Seriously . - medical school . I dropped out . - you 're packing . Why are you packing ? - because I 'm going home . Maybe forever . - no. no , no , no , no . you can 't do that . I told you that I was gonna handle it . - with what ? baby powder ? That doesn 't exactly inspire confidence . - I know . I know . And that 's why I called my dad . You 're too important ... To me . I just don 't want to lose you . - I 'm sorry . I already booked my flight . - wait , wait , wait . you don 't understand , okay ? This is rene , And he can keep Becky from being able to turn invisible . - I 'm scared for my life , okay ? - I know . - do you ? Because Becky 's after me . She 's not after you , Because you can 't get hurt . But I can . - Gretchen . Gretchen , everything 's gonna be fine . Okay ? my dad and I have done this a thousand times . - exactly ! This is everyday life for you , But it 's not for me . I 'm just not like you . - stay with her , please , Until she gets on the plane . - can I help you ? - possibly . Hopefully . - I apologize for this awkward introduction And my more awkward agenda . My name is samuel , And I 'm here looking for my niece , Rebecca . Becky . - and why would I know where your niece is ? - because she told me who you are , Claire . At least a little bit . I know you 're special . Like her. like me . I know you 're asking yourself right about now , " who is this guy ? What could he possibly know about me ? " - yeah , something like that . - I also know it 's very hard To trust anyone in this world Being ... one of us . - so why should I trust you ? - you shouldn 't . Not until you hear me out . If you have a moment to listen , I might have some answers for you . [ door closes ] - I had a partner like you once . As I recall , about 10,000 volts of electricity Should make you materialize ... And then some . Don 't want to have to use this . - why do I find that hard to believe ? - just you today ? - I 'm actually hungry enough to eat for two . - if memory serves , The Tahitian pancakes here are really good . And a coke . Uh , a diet coke . - oh , I 'd say go for the real thing . Life 's too short for artificial sweeteners . - well , amen to that ... Lynette . Regular coke it is . - yeah . - oh , she 's so sweet . Isn 't Lynette so sweet ? Funny story ... I tried to kill a waitress here once . - you can 't kill her . - oh , I 'm sorry . Did you miss my whole " the world is my hostage " bit earlier ? - no , I got it . I got it . I 've done nothing . and I 've kept quiet . - and now I want you to talk . Hostages are used to get things that you want , And I want to know everything- - Exactly how I ended up in your head , And where the hell my body is . - no . - it 's nice and isolated back there . Nobody 'd ever hear her scream . - come on . Stop. please . Come on. stop it . - okay , fine . Just tell me what I want to know . Your choice . Her life is in your hands . - do you need something , sweetheart ? - as a matter of fact , I do . All right . fine , fine . I will tell you anything you want to know . - thank you very much . - so you can move the earth ? - something like that . We 're all like you . A family of sorts . People with extraordinary abilities . Rebecca came to us when she was still very young . - so she 's not really your niece ? - a family is more than blood . It 's about trust , About love . About those who embrace you . The real you . Unconditionally . - Becky pushed my roommate out the window . Do you embrace that ? - no , of course not . But Rebecca 's complicated . Her father was murdered When she was just five years old . - okay , but how is that my fault ? - it 's not . You 're not the one she 's after . - it 's all about you . - I 'm sorry . Do I know you ? - you don 't remember me at all ? Well , I guess you wouldn 't . You never saw me . But I remember you . I was five when you came to my house , When you tried to take me and my dad away . He told me to stay out of sight . - shh . - I had never seen him so scared . [ pounds open doors ] [ whooshing ] - and then in came my dad ? [ gunfire continues ] - shooting first , asking questions later . - well , I 'm sure he had a good reason . - the reason is we were different . Potentially dangerous . Your father needed neither warrant nor probable cause . Not for people like us . Life is more complicated . - I hid under the bed and I wished ... Wished that you wouldn 't find me . And my wish came true . You didn 't see me . - your ability manifested . - I kept making wishes , That that whole night had never happened , For my dad to come back . I have spent my entire life Wondering why I could make a wish And save myself , but not him . - I thought perhaps Becky had moved past it , but ... - she came to get revenge on him . - through you . - and then when I found out that you had a daughter , I stopped making wishes And I made a promise . I 'm gonna take away All of the dreams that you had for her Just like you did to me . - I 'm sorry about your father . I take responsibility for that . But you 're not going to hurt my daughter . - I 'm gonna hurt you both . - Becky , I picked up your costume . Oh , um , hi . What are you doing in here ? - just , um , looking for someone . I guess she 's gone . excuse me . - I am truly sorry for what happened to your roommate . Both of them . But it was good of you To send the other away . - I didn 't send her away . She left . - well , it 's a slanted perspective To see the extraordinary Through ordinary eyes . Fear is easier than understanding . - so how do you deal with it ? - by not having to deal with it . I simply surrounded myself with people who , By definition , are like me . It 's a whole lot easier For someone like you to understand you . Which is why I came to you and not your father . We both know exactly what he would do in this situation . - no , tell me . [ gun cocks ] What would Bennet do ? - I don 't mean you any harm . I swear . - he said he was Becky 's uncle . - you were stalling . You kept me talking . - you seem to like to talk . You actually think that I would trust you over my dad ? - I just ran into your niece . She 's , um , not all there , is she ? - Rebecca 's a very disturbed girl . But in all fairness , You had a hand in that . A responsibility . - okay , let 's talk responsibility . What do you know about this ? - what is that ? - every time I see that compass , It comes with a dead body . First was Danko 's . - agent Danko killed my brother . He started all this . We didn 't want any bloodshed . - well , you forgot to tell that to your knife-wielding friend Who sliced my guts open . - in the wrong hands , This compass could mean trouble for my family . We just need to stay hidden . - from who ? - well , for starters , you . No offense , sir , but you have a reputation For scorching earth to get to people like me . Please , I just need to find Rebecca And get her some help . - and I want some answers . - help ! Somebody help ! She 's not breathing . - let 's get her to the e.r. - no time . it 's a pneumothorax . I can do this . Thoracotomy kit . - okay . Take over . - [ gasps ] - hey . Hey , sweetheart . You 're gonna be okay , all right ? You 're gonna be okay . You did it . - you really should watch how you treat us In front of your daughter . After all , she 's like me . - you really ought to watch what you say to my daughter . - don 't blame your father . He really doesn 't understand us . - get in the car . - [ groans ] - Rebecca , no ! [ electricity crackles ] - no , come on . - dad , don 't ! - look out ! - dad , no ! - I 'm so sorry . You all right ? I 'm sorry . - okay , here 's the truth . After Peter took you down , I pushed Nathan 's memories into your mind . I made your body think that it was him . Your shape-shifting took care of the rest . I had never done this before . I thought that I was pushing all of Sylar Out of that body . I didn 't--I had no idea That all of it would stay with me . - well , that 's just crazy . Just the check , please , Lynette . Thank you . - clearly you didn 't decide to do this on your own . Who else was involved ? Mama Petrelli , right ? who else ? - Bennet . Everyone else thinks you 're dead . - well ... I was off to see the wrong brother . I got to go find Nathan . Get my body back . - then what are you gonna do ? - then I 'm gonna kill ... Every single person Even remotely involved . [ sirens wailing ] - you should really pay more attention To what you 're doodling on a napkin . - hands up ! - police. freeze . - what the hell are you doing ? - I 'm crossing that line . You told me that I 'm not man enough to take a life . Well , you know what ? you 're wrong . 'cause I 'm gonna take yours . - you 're an idiot . you 'll die with me . - yeah . I know . - gun ! [ indistinct police radio chatter ] - I 'm sorry I pushed you . - it 's okay . I don 't bruise easy . - no , you don 't , do you ? Hey . You 're amazing . You know that ? - think you mean extraordinary . - I want you to have everything . You deserve it . A social life . The education . The white picket fence . All of it . - well , as you said , sometimes life Just isn 't that simple . Good night . - night , Claire bear . [ pressing piano keys ] - who 's that ? - my nephew , Christopher . He drowned . I was babysitting , and ... I got distracted for a moment . I didn 't hear him . I tried to revive him . It was right before my second year of residency . - that 's why you dropped out . - yeah . - Megan wanted you to have that . She said it 's only for very special people . - special . I couldn 't save him . - but you saved her . - you saved me . Thank you . - are you gonna go back to school ? Go be a doctor ? [ presses keys ] - can you see the colors ? - no . I don 't have that power anymore . But we could still play , if you like . [ siren wailing ] - still asystolic . - all right . 360 . [ defibrillator charging ] - clear . - I 'm sorry I had to do that to you . - I 'm sorry that I messed things up with Claire . I just ... Got impatient . sloppy . - don 't worry . Might not have been the plan as conceived , But I think Claire Bennet 's Right where we want her to be . Look , when I asked you to do this , I promised you revenge , And you 'll still have it . [ chuckles ] - uh , we have a problem . A big problem . - what ? - Sylar , he 's gone . [ knocking at door ] [ knocking ] - Nathan , what are you--what--what ? - oh , thank god . - what are you doing ? What 's going on ? - I think I 'm in trouble , Pete .

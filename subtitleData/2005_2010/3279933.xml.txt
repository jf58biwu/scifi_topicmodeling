 [ Sarah 's Narrator ] In the future , my son will lead Mankind in a war against skynet , the computer system programmed To destroy the world . It has sent machines back through time . Some to kill him . One to protect him . Today we fight to stop skynet from ever being created . To change our future . To change his fate . The war to save mankind begins now . The Sarah Connor Chronicles Season01 Episode05 Previously on terminator : The Sarah Connor chronicles ... SARAH : Cromartie is here . Are you forgetting that I blew his head off ? CAMERON : He came through . He knows we 're here . It 's just a head . [ SARAH ] we 're programmed to repair ourselves . We 're programmed to blend in . there are other people here . resistance fighters . humans sent back from the future by john . Who have money and guns . MAN : jumper outside the gym ! CAMERON : It 's my new friend . The crying one of the bathroom . - We gotta help her now ! - No . [ SARAH ] I need you to look at these photographs . Tell me if you recognize anybody . TERISSA : The young one . His name is Andrew Goode . He was an intern at cyber dyne one summer . Do you want to have dinner with me tonight ? My Turk plays chess at level that could defeat every human player that 's ever lived , and probably ever will live . SARAH : you talk about it like it 's human . Well , you never know . [ SARAH ] Andy Goode must be killed . [ SARAH 'S NARRATOR ] Of all the training my son received in the jungles of central America , nothing prepared him better for combat than the game of chess . It taught him almost everything he needed to know about war . That to win you must be patient , bold , calculating , and most of all ... willing to sacrifice . [ PHONE RINGING ] Andy , haven 't heard from you in a while . sorry I 've been out of touch . But after the fire in my house ... how can I explain ? It was kind of a blessing . Can you meet me ? Where are you ? A hotel in Pasadena . I 'm checking into a tournament . a tournament ? Yeah , you know , chess . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Charley Dixon ? Agent Kester , FBI . I need to ask you a few questions . What is this about ? Sarah Connor . Come in . [ SIGHS ] Are you really good at math ? Yes . You wanna do mine ? Yes . We got a problem . Andy Goode rebuilt his chess computer . The Turk . But you napalmed it . Apparently he spent every minute since then in a coffee shop in van nuys rewriting the code from memory . A good code is like a good song in your head . It 's gotta come out . Yeah , well , the song might just blow up the world . You should have killed him when you had the chance . And I 'm surprised it 's taken you this long to bring that up . I 'm busy doing john 's homework . Andy entered it into a tournament . Computer versus human ? Computer versus computer . It 's the new thing . These programs are too smart and powerful to play people anymore . It gets better the more we talk about it . You 're going to school . You and tin miss can meet me there later . Mom , it 's chess ; you don 't know anything . I know a bit about Andy . Besides , you can 't be absent . Absent gets you on the radar . Okay , I get it . You go . Can I have some money for lunch ? [ PEOPLE CHATTERING ] isn 't this awesome ? God , I love robots . Come here . so is this one better or worse ? Well , it 's different , really . More adaptable , but less predictable . Not as powerful for now , but quicker on its feet . It has a hunger for learning , but sometimes the lessons it learns ... sounds more human . Well , if you want an analogy , I 'd say that Turk i had grown into a brooding teenager , and Turk ii is still more of a precocious child . Ah , speaking of brooding and precocious , this is my partner , Dmitri Shipkov . taught it to play chess . She 'll never sleep with you . Da , poka . - You should plug that in . - Yep . Don 't listen to him . He 's ... he 's just worked up about the military contract . We have a deal to split the money . What military contract ? Well , the one the winner gets . Why don 't you people get your story straight ? Is she dead or isn 't she ? Sarah Connor survived the explosion in the bank vault . And so did her son . Yeah , that was eight years ago . You guys just figured that out ? [ CELL PHONE VIBRATED ] Yes . Yes ? Yes , what ? Yes , we just figured that out . WOMAN : babe , who was that at the door ? Good morning , ma 'am . He 's from the FBI . I 'm asking a few questions . - Charley , is something wrong ? - No . I 'm looking for the Connors . Sarah Connor ? Your ex ? - I 'm looking for them here . - Here ? Mr. Dixon wanted to marry Sarah Connor before you . She 's alive . Maybe he 's hiding her here . What ? I already told you , no . No , okay ? Look , all due ( INDISTINCT ) the woman that i knew , Sarah Reese , she blew herself up in a bank eight years ago . I never knew , and I do not know Sarah Connor . If you see or hear anything , call me . Any time , I never sleep . Just a reminder , grief counselling will be available in my office throughout the week . What are they doing ? They 're writing notes . For Jordan . She 's dead . Yeah , I remember watching her fall . Me too . How will she get the notes ? She won 't . But you said ... sometimes things happen and they 're so bad , people just don 't know how to deal with their sadness . So they write it in a note . But I thought people cried when they were sad . Sometimes it 's not enough . Are you gonna ... I didn 't really know her . I didn 't either . I like the note part . [ SCHOOL BELL RINGS ] [ SPANISH CHATTERING ] Nice accent , white boy . I have no idea what 's with those guys . They 're always mess with me . Yeah , man , I 've no idea . - I 'm Morris . - John . Hey , uh , I saw you talking to Cheryl Weston this morning . Maybe no one told you cause you 're new but she 's damaged goods . She 's my chem. partner . Do you know her or something ? No one knows her . Something crazy went on at the last school she was in , but no one knows what it is . Her dad 's got her locked down tight . [ INDISTINCT ] It 's truth . Not much of it . I 'm just looking out for you , bro . Yeah , you and everyone else . [ VOICE ] An extremely close match between the American and Japanese computers here in the finals . The Americans , led by programmer Andrew Goode , have a slight positional advantage . The Japanese seize control of the center with bishop to c5 . [ INDISTINCT CHATTERING ] [ BARKING ] Do you know how many grand masters are here ? How 's Andy doing ? Well , that depends on what your plans are for Andy . On the one hand , he 's in the final round , on the other hand ... the winner gets a military contract . Military ? Are you serious ? What do we do ? Cheer very hard for the Japanese or Cameron will kill him . [ VOICE ] an unorthodox move by the Japanese , leaving their queen hanging on d6 square . The American computer calculating a response . What just happened ? That bishop on c5 totally hammered him . Black 's in total zugswang . Translation ? The Japanese just lost the queen . They 're in big trouble . Andy 's gonna win . WOMAN : So that was quite a speech earlier . With the agent . That wasn 't a speech , it 's was just ... just what it was . What it was , was a lie . What ? A lie . You have a tell . a what ? A tell ? Yeah , a tell . When you lie . Do you know why you love me , charley ? I 'm gonna tell you why you love me . It 's cause I 'm not that girl . I 'm not that jealous girl . I 'm not that insecure girl . I 'm not that petty girl . Of course not . Yeah , so just don 't make me into that girl by lying to me . If that woman is alive , if you 've seen her ... this is important . I saw john . What ? Where ? Here . In our house . In our house ? In our house ? What did he want ? I don 't know . I think he just wanted to see me . What are you gonna do about it ? I don 't know . They 're fugitives , Charlie . They 're dangerous people . Sarah 's not dangerous . Oh well , maybe not the Sarah you knew . Sarah Reese , but Sarah Connor killed a man . We don 't know that . Well , what do we know ? What do you know ? [ VOICE ] The Japanese desperately hoping for counter play after the disastrous loss of their queen . Victory appears imminent for the Americans . Andy Goode 's Turk seized control of the match in the middle game , and now appears just moves away from winning . Rook to c2 . Checkmate . A shocking turn of events . The Japanese team has won the tournament . It 's over . Andy lost . But the other team ... they didn 't lose their queen , they sacrificed it . Just like Byrne Fischer all over again . Byrne-Fischer , 1956 ? Never mind . The point is ... the Turk fell for a trap ? It 's like it just ... choked . So now , what ? We go after them now ? No , their names weren 't in the safe house . Andy 's was . - What computational error ? you put the bishop on e6 to begin with ! - You asked me to teach it chess ... I taught it chess . I can 't help it if it 's stupid ! Nobody 's gonna want Andy 's program now . That thing 's kind of crazy . He could still be a threat . It could still become skynet . It could also become pong . What are you gonna do ? I don 't know . Maybe I 'll just sit Andy down and tell him everything . Andy . Who are you ? [ SIREN WAILING ] Put your hands above your head ! Do it now ! Turn ! Turn ! Spread ' em ! Put your hands behind your back . Over here . I 'm so sorry , Andy . What 's this ? You should write Andy a note if you can 't cry . Doesn 't bother you that he 's dead , does it ? The world is safer without him . JOHN : That was way too easy . L.A.P.D. Firewalls really blow . Show me what you found . Okay . No name , but he 's got this tattoo on his arm . He 's one of them . That 's a tattoo from a skynet work camp . He 's a resistance fighter . From the future . Like the three guys in the safe house ? He was the fourth . Then you know him . - In the future . - So do you . He 's one of your best soldiers . They 've been watching Andy Goode . Doing surveillance . Same as us . Well , not exactly the same . He actually killed the guy . That was not his mission . You sent him here to wait for us . Well , then I guess he changed his mind . A lot . I have to talk to him . Talk to him ? How ? He 's in lockdown . [ INDISTINCT CHATTERING ] [ GRUNTS ] Freeze . What are you doing ? Math . I already did your homework . Yeah , I know , but I still have to take the test . I need to know this stuff . Then why did you ask me to do it ? Because maybe it 's kind of hard to concentrate on geometry when people keep dying around you . You have no idea what I 'm talking about , do you ? You 're grieving . Grieving ? How do you know what grieving is ? I read all the notes . Cameron Baum , Mr. Harris wants to see you . I know this is difficult for you to talk about , so I 'm gonna need you to be strong . Okay ? Can you do that for me ? Yes . I can be strong . People say you were the last person to speak with Jordan before she ... died . Is that true ? I don 't know . Are you asking me if people say I was the last person to talk to Jordan , or are you asking me if I was the last one to talk to her ? I guess I 'm asking if you were . I don 't know . What did she say when you did talk to her ? I mean , was it something upsetting for you to hear ? She said , " you saw it , right ? Right ? You saw it ? It 's so freakin ' big and right out there . " She was talking about the graffiti ? It 's freakin ' big . Yes . Yes , it is . - And no . - No ? No , it wasn 't upsetting for me to hear it . Did Jordan mention any names ? Any specific people that she was upset with ? Her parents . Anyone else ? The hall monitors . Anyone else ? You ask that question a lot . Is there anything else you want to tell me ? I don 't think I told you anything . Oh , okay . Can I go now ? I 'm done with grief counselling , and I feel much better . Yeah , please . Go . Yo , john doe , you got a visitor . Those hurt ? Sometimes they crank those tight before they bring you in here . That way , you might ask me to loosen them up . And I am able to accommodate you in that . It 's a trick they do . It gives us a connection . But we already got a connection . Your prints are everywhere . Oven , light switch , toilet . Safe . Wasn 't us who found it . But somebody did . After the police thought they cleared the scene , somebody came back and emptied the safe right quick . Didn 't force it either . They knew the combination . So we 've got you running from the scene of Andrew Goode 's murder . And we 've got you living at , and disappearing from , and most likely returning to the scene of these three murders . All of which would be a prosecutorial bounty . But I 've also got forensic evidence , linking this to this Feeling connected yet ? What is it ? The forensic evidence linking all these people ... what is it ? Blood . Not my blood . No , not your blood . And , technically , not even blood . Some kind of synthetic . Come on , man , help me out . Tell me something I don 't know . We 're all gonna die . Yeah , I want him out of local custody today . He has more to say and I want him on federal turf when he says it . yes , this is Cameron 's mother . ms . Baum , you 're aware of the recent tragedy we 've had here at school ? - Jordan somebody . - Tallen . When I spoke to Cameron about it , she seemed strangely unaffected . I 'm sure you 're doing all you can as a parent . It 's been overwhelming for all of us , first with the tornado , then the move . Tornado ? I 'm sorry , she didn 't ( INDISTINCT ) that might explain what I think might be classic post-traumatic stress . You 're gonna have to speak up . [ CELL PHONE BLEEP ] You shouldn 't be here . I know who you are . And I know who you are . Who else but Sarah Connor would have burned down that poor kid 's house ? It was you , wasn 't it ? On Andy 's porch that night . You 've been watching . You wanted to kill him , the poor kid , and you did . I didn 't do it . All I wanted was the Turk . Somebody else killed him and took the machine . What ? He was dead when I got there . He was dead and the Turk was gone , and I hoped you 'd done it . You thought I killed him ? But you 're here . And the Turk is out there . So we both failed . You gotta get out of here . If you haven 't figured it out , I have a t-888 on my ass . Now if you found me , it will too . - We should get you out . - Go . Find the partner , the Russian . He 's gotta be neck-deep in this also . - You 're dead in here . - Go ! Please . I won 't be the bastard who brings metal down on the Connors , so just go . You 're ... you 're prettier than your picture . Picture ? Yeah , it 's actually how I clocked you . My brother carried your snap for luck . Who 's your brother ? What does it matter ? You don 't know the Reese boys , and you never will . Reese boys ? Derek Reese . Brother 's Kyle . [ SARAH 'S NARRATOR ] when john sent Kyle Reese back to protect me , we had two days together . He told me about the future , about the apocalypse , and the terror of a world run by machines . Kyle Reese saved my life . He gave me a son . He never told me that he had a brother . He never told me we would have family . That in our grief we are not alone . Cheri . Cheri . Walk away . John , please . Lock and key , bro . Lock and k mom 's here . I 'm Morris . Your brother 's new best friend . Cameron . Nice grip . Watch yourself . Just lookin ' out for ya . Field trip . I call shotgun . I call 9-millimeter . What 's the E.T.A. On my prisoner ? All right . [ SIGHS ] [ TIRES SQUEALING ] [ GRUNTS ] - Drop it . Now . - Easy . Easy . Run . You stay close . Take the jeep and follow us . You metal bitch . She 's on our side . ( INDISTINCT ) Lose him . Let 's go . - Where 's Cameron ? - Leave her , let 's go . Let 's go . Stay back Get down [ GROANS ] Bring me the toolbox . Switchblade . Pliers . [ GROANING ] [ GRUNTS ] Do something . We have to help him . Don 't let that thing touch me . - We have to stop your bleeding . - Get away from me . Please don 't move . You 're increasing your blood loss . I can 't fix it . You took a bullet out of me . He has internal damage . He needs medical attention , or he 's gonna die . A stun gun . Are you nuts ? He needs a doctor . What , so you 're just gonna go out and kidnap one ? There 's an E.R. A mile away . It 's almost dark . Mom , this is crazy , all right . Even for you , it 's insane . And what happens when you get caught ? Then what ? I said we have to save him . You don 't even know who this guy is . He 's your uncle . He doesn 't know . He 's your father 's brother . His name 's Derek Reese . John . Two females , approximately 5 ' 6 " , 120 pounds , overpower you and your partner , ambush your secure vehicle , and kidnap my prisoner . That an accurate summation of what happened out here today , officer ? Yeah . [ HELICOPTER WHIRRING ] 5 ' 6 " . 5 ' 6 " . [ SARAH 'S NARRATOR ] If there is a flaw in chess as a game of war , it is this : Unlike war , the rules of chess are constant . The pieces unchangeable . You will never win the heart of a rook or the mind of a knight . They are deaf to your arguments . And so be it . The goal of a chess game is total annihilation . But , in war , even as the blood beats in your ears and you race after your enemy , will stop you before you reach your target . In war , unlike chess , rules can be changed . Truces can be called . The greatest of enemies can become the best of friends . Derek . Derek . He 's not breathing . Reese ! Reese ! [ SARAH ] In war , there is hope .

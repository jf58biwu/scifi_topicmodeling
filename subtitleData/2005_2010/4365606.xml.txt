No , I 'm her brother , John Baum . Anything you say is confidential . Except if you were planning to harm someone , I would have to report that . - Jesse . - Hi , baby . Are you AWOL ? Jesse , did you run ? I need a place to rest . Why ? Aren 't you on the same side ? Skynet does not believe in you like I do . Believe ? What do you believe ? You will lead me to the Connors . Stay there . There 's no one here . Where the hell are you ? Where the hell am I supposed to be ? - We just got robbed . - You were what ? Diamonds , cash , credit cards , IDs . They cleaned us out . Machine ? My leather jacket 's gone . - So is most of the food . - Human . If those IDs fall into the wrong hands ... Listen , head downtown . I 'll call you with an exact location in half an hour . Who was that ? Real life calling . You don 't always have to answer . I tried it ignoring it all before and the whole freaking town blew up . You 're a funny man . That 's the first thing people say . Funny Derek . What 's wrong with the system ? Why didn 't it beep like you set it up ? Riley climbed out John 's window . Impossible with the alarm turned on . Thanks . - You gave her the code ? - We were up late watching TV . She was supposed to reset it . And somehow your master plan went awry . - Mom ... - John , our IDs are out there . Our names , our faces . Fake addresses , fake names . Nothing can be traced to this house . No ? What if the police find the guy ? Where that trail leads to ? If our IDs made it into the system linked to this address ... Canada . We should move to Canada . Saw your door was open . I thought I 'd bring you guys some ... Oh , my God , what happened ? - I 'll go call Trevor . - No . John 's been having trouble with kids at school . - Seriously ? - Yeah . You know how stupid kids can be . Anyway , you 'll know soon enough . We 're on our way to see their parents . All right , if you change your mind ... I 'll call you . What am I supposed to do ? I 'd start with a broom . Come on , Rita . I got the county breathing down my neck . We can 't have a backlog like this . I 'll get it done . - Today . - I needed it two weeks ago . It 's my son . He took off this morning with the neighbor 's car and my credit cards . We 'll call you right away if he attempts a charge , Miss Baum . - Is this a good number to reach you ? - Yes , thank you . If you knew , why didn 't you say something ? - To you ? - To me , to him , to somebody . I 've always made my position on security very clear . No one likes a nag . I 'm looking for this girl . You see these people , Sir ? These people are real . These are the real people , and they were all here before you . I 'm her uncle . And I 'm Angelina Jolie . Get to the back of the line . I know that chick . So what do you want her for ? - She owe you money ? - I 'm her uncle . You 're not her uncle . You 're a cop . I 'm not a cop . You gonna hurt her ? And her brother too ? Her brother ? John Baum or whatever . John Baum ? Another prize . Is that him ? That 's him . Let 's take a ride . - Who is it ? - Los Angeles Police Department . Hold on . I catch up on last night 's game . You know who won ? Steelers , Mr. Ellison . Could you open the door please ? You James Ellison ? I 'm placing you under arrest for the murder of Peter Meyers . What ? You have the right to remain silent , and to an attorney . If you cannot afford one , one will be appointed to you . Do you understand these rights as I 've read them to you , Sir ? I know my rights . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Please put your hands against the wall . Now , Mr. Ellison . Episode 207 : Brothers of Nablus v 1.01 Come on , Moishe , open up . - Who are they ? - New customers . Everything we do , without exception , can be seen many ways in the eyes of God , or nature , or whatever you want to call it . Someone came into your home . Someone took things that were yours . The Torah says , " Lo tikom ve 'lo titor . " No revenge , no retribution . On the other hand , it also says , " Ayan tachat ayn . " An eye for an eye . And we have the story of the Brothers of Nablus ... We came here looking for our diamonds . Can you help us or not ? I wish I could . But lately , business is dry as a bone . I called four other fences . They said you were the busiest man on the block this week . Nothing you 'd be interested in . Show us . These ... I bought in the last two days . All from legitimate sources . This one 's ours . Young lady , even if those were your diamonds , and they 're not ... there 's no way you could tell that with the naked eye . We have machines . So are these . We don 't want any trouble . Tell us where you got ' em and we 're gone . You think I can put a face to every diamond in this stack ? Just a face from the last 24 hours . Moishe , please . All right . It 's so early in the week for trouble . But it 's not for you . It 's for Jesse . His name 's Ostrowski . Walter Ostrowski . Where do we find him ? He works out of Toluca Lake , or so he says . I just buy the stones . And this Ostrowski , you 're sure he 's the guy who sold you these ? I shall not lie . If you 're so into God , what are you doing here ? Hashem has a plan for us all . For me , diamonds . - Who 's Jesse ? - He came back with me . He handled the diamonds . One of them killed him . Do you want some gum ? No . You sure ? It 's cinnamon . Would it kill you to try and make a little conversation ? No , it wouldn 't kill me . Funny . You 're funny . In your own sort of cop way . I 'm not a cop . You 're not a cop . You 're not an uncle . You 're just some guy who wants to kick the crap out of little Miss Bitch and her brother . Just some guy . But why ? She try to kill you too ? Yes . Well , this is gonna be fun . I can 't believe they stole your food . Freaking amateurs , man . I know , right ? What do you think they 're gonna do with two-week old maple turkey ? Bet your mom freaked out , huh ? Yeah , on me . On you ? Why on you ? The alarm code . - Did I forget ? - Yeah , you did . I didn 't actually see it happen . I wasn 't here , but I 'm sure this ... Yeah , I 'm positive . This is where they busted her . I heard the cops talking about it when they brought her in . You are so buying me these pink and whites , and that is all there is to it . Have you seen this girl ? I 'm looking for this girl . I 'm so sorry , John . I can 't believe I did that . Don 't worry about it . It wouldn 't have stopped a break-in . Might have stopped the picnic , but ... So I know you want to find them and everything , but this is getting a little shady . Does she hate me now ? Don 't sweat it . It 's a long list . You won 't get what you want this way . You should try being warmer to people . They might be more open , you know , to talk to you . I love this stuff . That 's my bad . That 's the guy . That 's definitely the guy . What am I doing here , detective ? You 've been on my side of the table . You know how this works . I ask a question , you answer it . - Why am I being questioned ? - You tell me . Who 's Peter Meyers ? - I don 't know Peter Meyers . - You killed him . Killed him ? - No . - Yes . I 've got a witness . Saw the murder . Recognized you from the news a few weeks ago . Recognized me ? - From the news ? - The news ? 20 of your guys dead ... You the sole survivor . By now you 're drowning in guilt , I 'm guessing . - Throw yourself an anchor . - Don 't know what you 're talking about . I 'm talking about surviving , Mr. Ellison . I 'm talking about the everyday , walk around pain of surviving when others have not . I wanna talk to my lawyer . Sure . I meant to ask you . Why did you steal his clothes ? - What ? - Meyers ' clothes . - You were naked when you killed him . - I told you , it wasn 't me . Smart . Your alibi isn 't exactly ironclad , Jim . Unless , of course , you got a twin brother I don 't know about . You got a twin brother I don 't know about ? Dr. Ostrowski 's in with patients all afternoon . - Would you like to make an appointment ? - We 'll just take a second . Excuse me ! Walter Ostrowski ? I think you have something that belongs to us . Do I know you ? No , but we have a friend in common , someone in the diamond district . Moishe . Why don 't we ... talk in my office . It 's ... just across the hall . Please , please , don 't kill me . - Where 's our stuff ? - What stuff ? Passports , IDs , credit cards . - Leather jacket . - Everything you stole from our house . Your house ? I don 't ... Tell Moishe I 'll pay him . I 'll give you the money today . It 's upstairs in my office . - Pay Moishe for what ? - Everything I owe him . Please . Just don 't kill me . Let him go . - Why ? - He 's not the guy who robbed us . And go get Moishe 's money . That 's why we 're here , running a collections agency for your fence ? Why we 're here is because our security system didn 't work . Why we 're here is because that boy behaves less like John Connor and more like John Baum every day . That boy , my son , has been through more than you 'll ever know . Right back at you . My friends . Is this what you 're looking for ? You do something for me , I do something for you . It 's business . This is business . Please , I just buy the stones . Who sold you our diamonds ? Okay , okay , his name is Tristan Dewitt . - He lives in Reseda . - Not good enough . It 's true . I swear ! He 's a friend of my cousin 's , a punk . That 's all I know . You killed Liko . Not yet . You 're never gonna find them like this . Do you even know how many people live in LA County ? An employee at the grocery store saw them shopping there on more than one occasion . It 's highly likely they live within a one-mile radius . I 'm looking for this girl . This is stupid . Just take me back to the halfway house . Did you hear me ? I am done hanging out with a creepy stalker . I don 't even know your name . I just came with you because I wanted to get back at that bitch . And I thought you were kind of cute . But you know what ? You 're not cute . You 're freakin Silence of the Lambs . This is kidnapping . You know that , right ? I could have you arrested . What are you doing ? Why are we stopping ? Freak ! You 're blocking the sun . Had an interesting morning with our friend Moishe . He 's dropping your name in front of people who don 't need to be hearing your name . - Well , he 's your fence . - He likes you better . I 'll have a talk with him . Help me out , will you ? How long are you planning on keeping this up ? - What ? - You know what , all this . Well , I 'm certainly gonna try to get through today without you spoiling it for me . The sun sets at 5 : 47 . I 'm not missing that sucker . I 'm not missing one of those again . I 'm looking for this girl . Why are you looking for her ? Has she done something ? She 's my niece . You ... You look really familiar . Common face . Have you seen my niece ? I haven 't . I 'm sorry . The house next door , it 's on the market . - You 're listed as the contact . - That house has been rented . Thank you for your time . You guys really know how to party . My mom 's not much of a cook . What about Cameron ? She 's not really into food . You gonna get that ? No , if they need me , they 'll call my cell . Oh , right , because you 're so important . Hello , Baum residence . Yeah , just a sec . Here 's John . It 's your neighbor . Thanks . - Yeah , hey , Kacy . What 's up ? - Hey , John . I don 't mean to bother you , but there was a guy here looking for your sister . - When ? - Just now . And I did not get a good vibe from him at all . Something was just off , you know ? What 's the matter , John ? What 's wrong ? - Out . We gotta get out now . - Why ? Who 's there ? - No , it 's okay , I 'll get rid of him . - No , now . I 'm looking for this girl . She 's my niece . Sorry , I don 't know her . Wish I could be more help . Good luck finding her . How do you like your new house ? It 's really nice , I love it . Excuse me , what do you think you 're doing ? Hello , you can 't just come into people 's homes . Hello , are you listening to me ? What is wrong with you ? You 're not in these photographs . Maybe because I was the one taking them . Look , if you don 't leave , I 'm calling the police . Thank you for your time . We were too supportive . That was the problem in a nutshell . Your son says he wants to be a filmmaker . You tell him , " Son , movies are great . " I love going to see them . But that 's pie in the sky . " You need a salary job . " Thank you for not going to the police about this . We just want our things back . " Come live at home , " I told him . " Until you can get on your feet . " And every time I bring up the idea of him getting a salary job , he 's got this project to work on , or that short film he 's producing . He 's had his troubles , but he 's a good boy . He 's not a boy , Donna . He 's a 34-year-old man . He lives with us , working in a video store , robbing people 's homes . Video store ? Saturn video on La Brea . And who knows if that 's true when every other word out of his mouth is a lie . Does your son have any friends who might know where he is ? Anyone at the video store ? Dave . Dave . Another boy wonder . This is a very curious turn of events , Mr. Ellison . I 'm innocent . There 's an eyewitness . It wasn 't me . The witness is quite sure . As I would be if I had seen what he 'd seen . Is there something you want to tell me , James ? Something only I would believe ? Not here . I 'll be in touch . Miss Weaver . Thank you for believing me . What good is faith if we don 't use it ? - Where are we going ? - Nowhere . Anywhere . That guy isn 't really Cameron 's uncle . Because then he 'd be your uncle . He 's nobody 's uncle . Then why is he after Cameron ? Is she a criminal or something ? No , he is , all right ? Well , what if he comes back ? That 's not how ... That 's not how he works . - John , I don 't understand . - Look , that guy is really dangerous . That 's all you need to know . Really dangerous . Well , I got rid of him , didn 't I ? I stared him down , and off he went . - You got lucky . - Ease up , squinchie . " Lucky " is my middle name . Lucky Riley Dawson . In that sentence , " Lucky " was your first name . Whatever . Stickler . Admit it , I was a brave , spooky ninja . It was totally badass . Say it ! Just say it . It was badass . I know ! Fool 's errands and the Fathers of Nablus . - It 's been a great day . - Brothers . - What ? - Brothers of Nablus . Genesis . Chapter 34 . You 've memorized the Bible ? Jacob 's daughter Dinah is raped by Shechem , Prince of Nablus . He falls in love with her . Shechem 's father comes to Jacob and strikes a bargain to allow his son to marry Dinah . - That 's brave of him . - Jacob says yes , on the condition that all the men in Shechem 's town be circumcised . Everybody gets what they want . Three days later , while Shechem 's men were still in pain from the circumcision , Dinah 's brothers rode into the city and killed them all . That 's your kind of story . Yes . My kind of story . Hello . - Miss Baum ? - Yeah . This is Dan Deffenbaugh calling to let you know somebody just attempted a charge with your card . - Where ? - At a bowling alley in Van Nuys . Alien Lanes . Sorry to keep you waiting . I just have a few more questions , then we 'll get you out of here . You say Mr. Ellison was completely nude when he killed Meyers . I already told you . And that he killed him with his bare hands ? - Didn 't use a weapon ? - He strangled him . Did Meyers fight back ? A little , but the other guy was too strong . How so ? Snapped his neck like it was nothing . A toothpick . Where was Mr. Ellison before he killed Mr. Meyers ? - Out on the road . - The road . The road , the street , asphalt . - Anything unusual about the street ? - Who cares about the street ? Are you lying about the street ? It was like ... - It was like a crater . - A pothole . It was like a complete dent in the road . Mr. Ellison just appeared out of thin air ? - There was a light . - What kind of a light ? Bluish purple . It made , like , a cracking sound . Like lightning . So Mr. Ellison emerged from this ... energy bubble . I never said anything about a bubble . But there was a bubble , correct ? So to be clear , you saw Mr. Ellison ... materialize out of this energy bubble , completely nude , walk to Peter Meyers , snap his neck , steal his clothes , and then disappear . - I know what I saw . - Thank you for your assistance . Nice . It 's 1863 and Abraham Lincoln is on the train to Gettysburg . Then the train breaks down . Some small Pennsylvania town . So he 's got to stay there overnight . The only problem ... town 's overrun with zombies . We shoot it on location , in Gettysburg , 35 millimeter . Dude , with what money ? What money ? Do you know how much we made just off these right here ? Put it down . That bag you 're holding , it 's mine . - Not anymore it isn 't . - This place is closed , ladies . Unless you wanna get arrested , I suggest you get the hell out . My jacket , give it to me . Come and get it . - Come and give it to me . - And the bag . There 's a credit card missing . We used it on the arcades . We 'll pay you back . Where 's the other guy ? What other guy ? Stay here . They knew where we live . You know those guys out there ? Were you with them when they robbed the house ? You were never there . You were never here . You never saw me . You don 't know what happened here . Understand ? If you say anything to anybody about what happened here , I 'll hunt you down . I 'll kill you . Now you wait five minutes , then you run . Understood ? - Clear ? - Yeah , clear . - You 're free to go . - What ? The witness is a nutjob . The judge kicked his statement in 5 min . We 'll have you out of here in an hour . Sorry you had to go through all this . That 's it ? You 're a smart guy , Jim . Take " yes " for an answer . Good luck out there . You were gonna have a talk with him . I did . It was short . What were you gonna say to him ? Well , you know me . Funny Derek . - How was the sunset ? - Never better . You never really struck me as the type to stalk your ex-wife . I 'm sorry . I just ... I had an urge to see the house . See something familiar . Weird , I know . You do realize you don 't live here anymore . Fancy ride . No wonder we keep losing people to civilian life . Company car . They lease it for me . I have to tell you , you don 't look so well . Yeah , I 'm not . I just ... I don 't know , I ... I miss it . I miss my old life . James , this is a really weird time to start into all that . No , no , I don 't mean that . Things have changed . And I just ... - I didn 't . - You 're not making sense . Come on , come inside . Paul can make coffee . We 'll talk about it . Thanks , but I didn 't come over for that . Yes , you did . This was the wrong thing for me to do . I don 't live here anymore . It was the right thing to do . Just five years too late . Call me the next time you wanna see something familiar . I 'll send you a picture . Who was it ? They won 't be back . Place looks good . I think we pretty much got everything back to how it was . We ? Riley helped . So how 'd you find ' em ? - Was it Derek 's fence , or what ? - You can 't bring people here anymore . What ? She had nothing to do with this . No , you did . She just made it worse . She 's a security risk . Really ? She 's never tried to kill me . And you know that this has nothing to do with Riley . Or the rules . Or the security of this house . You 're pissed off cause I found someone I actually like spending time with and it 's not you . You think I don 't want you to have a normal life ? No , I don 't . We didn 't choose this , John . It chose us . And there 's nothing either of us can do about it . My job is to protect you . And you can hate me as you want , but I will keep doing that as long as I 'm here . Then why didn 't you protect me when I was killing Sarkissian ? Why didn 't you protect me when I had my hands around his throat ? Why didn 't you protect me from that ? It 's a moray . They 're nocturnal predators . - Does it have a name ? - No , it doesn 't . Please , sit . I read the witness report . So did I. He comes across as crazy , doesn 't he ? - Who wouldn 't ? - You , if you 'd tell me the truth . There was another one of you , wasn 't there ? A twin ? Where is it now ? I don 't know . Why did it come ? I think I 'm being tested . Like Job ? You know the story ? He suffered worse than any man before him . Everything he loved was taken away . Everything but his life . But he didn 't renounce God . And God spared him . So ... who spared you ? Where did you get those credit cards ? I don 't know . Yes , you do . She said ... she would find me . She said she would kill me . I promise you , she won 't .

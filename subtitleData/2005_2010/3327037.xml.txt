Weve been through Kates test results more times than any patient in my whole career . * * * * * All the evidence suggests she has early onset Alzheimers . The youngest case in medical history . It doesnt mean were wrong . Please ... run more tests . Lets just try one more MRI scan . An MRI isnt going to make any difference . You dont know that . You have said yourself that this is unlike any case that youve seen , - and maybe youve missed something . - Owen ... You dont understand , Jim , OK . One day shes fine , shes perfect memory , the old Katie , and the next theres nothing , shes blank . Now , I am losing her and I dont know what to do about that , OK ? So please . Whats the point of me doing this job if I cant help my own fiancee ? Ill see what I can do . Thank you , Jim . Its like being lost , in a place you know really well , but you cant get your bearings . Sometimes it comes back to you . And sometimes ... Im sorry , Owen . Whatve you got to be sorry for ? I dont want to put you through this . Last night , I dreamt that you left me . Oh , come on . Nobodys leaving anyone . How is that possible ? We dont know . Ive never seen anything like it . Its not the brain deteriorating . Its a clear physical tumour . That wasnt there last week ? Not that we saw . You were right to ask for another scan . So what do we do now ? We have to view this as good news . Katie , we need to take you into surgery , soon as possible , and remove the tumour . Dyou understand ? Katie . I cant remember your name . Are you sure shes up to this ? Were going to do everything we can for her . Im sorry . Who the hell are you ? You should prepare for the worst . No , you cant go in there . Oh , my God ! Katie . What is it ? Im sorry . I tried to stop them . Shes dead . That thing in her head is an alien life form . It incubates in the brain , disrupting the shape and functions . When its attacked or threatened , it emits a toxic gas thats fatal to humans . It clears pretty quickly . She cant be dead . She cant be dead . Im calling , calling the police . Tell them that Torchwood is already here and dealing with it . Thatll save them a call-out . I need to take her brain back with me . Dont touch her ! - How are you feeling ? - Where is she ? - Wheres who ? - Katie . Katie Russell , shes a junior doctor , she works here , were about to get married . - Lets get you back into bed . - Get off me . Where is she ? Where is she ? Where is she ? He was wearing a military uniform . He had an American accent . We have checked all the security footage . There was no such man . Jim Garrett was poisoned by some alien toxin , by some ... Jim Garrett was in a car accident . The American said that he wanted her brain , that there was ... alien creature , or ... This happened , OK ? This is not some trauma or delayed grief or whatever youre scribbling down . Katies tumour was inoperable . There was nothing anyone could have done . This is just wrong . Im giving you three months prescribed rest . Dont come into work . Yeah ! This isnt right . He was there . It wasnt just me . He was there too . That is not what happened ! That is ... not what happened . You ! You couldve saved her ! You couldve saved her ! You couldve ... saved her ! I couldnt . I really couldnt . If youre not a figment of my imagination , then I dont know whats happening any more . Maybe this is ... what a mental breakdown feels like . Youre fine . Its the rest of the world thats delusional . Why her ? Theres no reason . Your life doesnt end with her . What are you gonna do now ? Go back to work ? See echoes of her in every corridor ? You need a purpose . Im building something . I need a medic . And you want me ? You made them take more scans . You kept trying to track me down . You dont give up easily . I need someone like that to work with me in Cardiff . To fight aliens . Exactly . Look ... I dunno what happened to Katie and I dunno who you really are , but there is no such thing as aliens . You think ? Im having a breakdown . Mental collapse . Owen , why did you become a doctor ? I thought if I could save one life , mine would be worthwhile . But you save one ... and theres another.And another . All clawing at you , demanding to be saved . And even if you do succeed , you can never save enough . Maybe here you can . - How are the others ? - All right . Careful ! If that falls ... OK , its not going to fall ... - OK . - Just be very careful . OK , all right , all right . Were gonna get you out . OK , this one ? - Look , if you do it very , very gently ... - OK .

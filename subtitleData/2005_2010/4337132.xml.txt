 NARRATOR : Previously on Surface . This is Dr. Laura Daughtery . NARRATOR : Rich and Daughtery dove to the bottom of the ocean ... LAURA : A pod of the new vertebrates . ... to prove to the world that the species existed . They survived stranded at sea . ( COUGHING ) RICH : Take the black bag ! Come on , it 's got the camera ! Don 't let go of it ! ( LAURA SCREAMING ) We need to keep this with us . NARRATOR : As Miles searched for Nimrod ... You 're not Nim ! ... he is attacked . ( BEEPING ) As he lay dying , the hunt for Nim was on . Oh ! KELLINO : hold him . Get him back . ( GUN FIRING ) ( GASPS ) No , no , no , no , no . No . Stay back . NARRATOR : Nimrod died and in a miracle , Miles healed overnight . Your wound is healed . And now , Surface continues . ( SIREN BLARING ) PARAMEDIC 1 : Severe dehydration , Iethargic , minimally responsive and hypothermic . Temp is 34 CeIsius . Airway is okay . Tachycardia with a pulse of 1 25 and hypotensive . I never thought not moving would feel so good . I never thought not moving would hurt so bad . LAURA : But we got it . I can hold that for you , ma 'am . No , no , no , no . I wanna hold onto it . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) What are they doing here ? PARAMEDIC 2 : Big news for a small town . Coast Guard 's been looking for you everywhere . Hey , it 's the press . We got a tape for you guys . No , we have to wait . Wait for what ? We have to be smart . Don 't you know how easy it is for us to look crazy ? We have to do it the right way . Let 's get a shot of them going in ! Hey , hey , back off . These guys have been through a Iot . MAN : Come on folks , back up . The NSA picked this up . The biometrics on the girl matched your watch list . LEE : Find out the hospital , call the portland FBI . Get them to pick these two up . On what legal authority ? I 'II handle the warrants . Hey , speak to the SAC . No one else . I want these two in an interrogation room in under an hour . Do you understand me ? Got it . PAUL : You sure you 're up for this ? I mean , you 're barely a day out of the hospital . You don 't need the added stress . I wanna see him . Okay . Give them a minute , guys . MAN : That should do it . ( NIM GRUNTS ) Oh , sorry . I 'II come back . No , wait . He made a sound . A sound ? I couId 've swore ... Like a sneeze . It 's dead , miles . They check these things . Yeah , yeah . You 're right . It 's ... ( NIM GRUNTS ) ( SQUAWKING ) I wouldn 't get any closer . He doesn 't like strangers . ( SNARLING ) JARED : Dr. bloom ! Dr. bloom ? You 're not gonna believe this . JARED : Dr. bloom ! What ? It 's alive . It woke up and jumped off . PAUL : Woke up ? MILES : careful . What was that ? Just stay calm . You 're making him angry . Nim . Nobody wants to hurt you , okay ? ( NIM GROWLING ) Here . It 's okay . Try to get him in the tank . The tank ? So you can lock him up , get the police over here ? miles , this is a very important specimen . They 'II kill him ! You saw what they did at the hospital . They think Nim eats people . I 'm gonna take him back to the ocean , to the wild . PAUL : What wild ? The whole eastern seaboard 's developed . There 's no more " wild " left for him . He 's safer here , where we can learn about him . You can help us . You know more about him than anybody . I won 't let anybody take him from you , miles . I promise . Have you heard anything about Jackson holden ? We launched from his trawler . I haven 't heard about him . Okay , well , maybe we could check the Coast Guard and see if there 've been any emergency calls . Right now , you need to worry about yourself . Look , if I hear anything , I 'II let you know , okay ? Try to sleep . Her stats look fine . She is asking about ... ( WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA SYSTEM ) Excuse me . Excuse me . ( ELEVATOR DINGS ) MAN : But Frank , it 's not in here . It 's in the next room . FRANK : You sure ? ( YELPS ) I almost punched you in the face . We gotta get out of here . I know . It 's okay . Okay . Let 's go . WOMAN : ( ON PA SYSTEM ) Nurse Grant to 3 West . Nurse Grant to 3 West , please . RICH : There 's no way we 're gonna get out of here . ( SNORING ) Hey , hey , hey , hey . Look at this . How about these , huh ? Yeah , right . ( CELL PHONE BEEPING ) Hey ! What are you doing ? I 'm just calling Jesse to let him know I 'm okay . What ? No . Don 't do that , Laura . Why ? Just quickly . I just need to hear his voice . Laura ! What makes you think that if they followed us to this little town in Oregon that they ain 't staking out Sean 's house or my sister-in-Iaw 's already ? I just need to hear his voice really quickly . Laura , you don 't understand . They 're already tapping the phones . Come on , now , that 's the easiest and first thing that they do , okay ? If you call him now , you 're gonna putting him in more danger than he already is . Rich , jeez , I mean , don 't you need to hear your kid 's voice ? I mean , doesn 't that kill you ? Yes , of course I do ! But it 's not an option . It 's not an option . Okay ? Now , we gotta finish putting on these clothes , see if that ATM card works and just let 's concentrate on the things that we do have control over , all right ? Like getting that tape into the right hands , right ? Yes . Okay then . Come on . ( TELEPHONE RINGS ) Hi , Sean , it 's Laura . Laura , you okay ? I called the Coast Guard , but I can 't ... I know . I 'm ... I 'm okay . Look , I can 't let Rich know that I 'm making this call . Yeah , there are people looking for you . What people ? They were there ? Yeah . What about Jesse ? How ... Is he okay ? He 's fine . Sean , I 'm gonna come there . No , don 't . I don 't care . I 'm gonna come there . It 's not safe for you , okay ? Okay . AII right , Sean , well , please give him a big kiss for me , please . Yeah , I will . AII right . I got 300 bucks . AII right , come on , Iet 's go . You should know your son has done something quite extraordinary . well , thank you . It 's been very interesting around our house lately . well , it truly is an amazing animal . I may be getting ahead of myself , but this could be bigger than the coelacanth . CoeIacanth ? well , Iet 's just say it 's a little bit like finding a unicorn . Except Nim 's real . well , he certainly is . This is David HoweII from the North carolina Oceanographic University . This is Dr. Hammaker , from the Smithsonian in Washington . How does it feel to make natural history ? Pretty good , I guess . MAN : ( ON PA SYSTEM ) Attention Copy City customers , all online services and color printing discounted 20 % this week . Hey , there . You guys need some assistance ? Yeah , actually we do . We 're looking to do a couple things . We want to upload the footage on this tape , and then make a couple of DVD copies of it . Keith 's better with the computers . KEITH : We 'II download the tape onto the hard drive . LAURA : Okay . Then upload and burn from there . cool . cool . Just need a firewire . Goes up in there . MAN : ( ON PA SYSTEM ) Attention Copy City customers ... What 's that ? Why is it doing that ? ... discounted 20 % this week . Please take advantage of this special offer . It looks like the tape got wet . No , no , no . That shouldn 't be a problem . That should be fine . Man , what are you doing ? The reels on the tape are sticking . I 'm just gonna tighten them up . Okay , sorry . Just ... We traveled a Iong way to get that footage . Right . I understand . Oh , come on , man . This can 't be happening , now . There it is . You guys shot this ? Yeah . What we need to do is we need to get it on the web , and we need as many people to see it as possible . What are our options for that ? You mean like viral video ? Yeah , yeah . exactly . Strange film . That 's the joint . I mean , people post videos like that George Bush cartoon , cats with two tongues , stuff like that . people can get it , they can copy it , and they can send it out to all their friends ? Yeah . Maximum eyeballs . I mean , how do you think that Paris hilton tape happened ? Hey , what is that ? That , brother , is a new species . HOWELL : Where did you find the egg ? Out in the harbor , by Figure Eight . There was a whole bunch of them . So you took it home . And put it in our fish tank . We have some of the eggs here , but they 're not fertilized . But a Iot of eggs have hatched . whole swarms of them . He thinks that may be what 's responsible for the killing out at Southport . And I got attacked by a swarm , out at the electric cable . But Nim would never do that . Nim ? Nimrod . That 's his name . How did you come up with that ? actually my friend phil did . I mean , we totally trained him . He 's smarter than a dog . HAMMAKER : What 's this about the electrical ? I ... He just likes it . And salt . He loves salt . And he obviously has some really advanced healing capabilities . Yeah . Yeah . So , it ' s kind of better if we go in one or two at a time . I think a Iot of people would spook him . Whatever you say , miles . This is your show . David , why don 't you go in and one more ? Mom ? Okay , so just keep quiet and no sudden movements around the tank and he 'II stay calm . ( GROWLING ) You kept this thing in your house ? ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) MAN : They skipped , boss . They were gone when we got there . ( SIGHS ) She 'II try to make contact with her son . She already did . We got something off the tap on the ex-husband . well , Iet me hear it . ( ON TAPE ) Hi , Sean , it 's Laura . ( ON TAPE ) Laura , are you okay ? I called the Coast Guard , but I can 't ... I know . I 'm ... I 'm okay . Look , I can 't let Rich know that I 'm making this call . She called from a pay phone ? Yeah , well , there are people looking for you . A cell . probably stolen . What people ? They were there ? Yeah . They can 't be too far from the hospital . Is he okay ? He 's fine . Here 's 15 extra DVDs for you . And you 're a go for Strange film . Okay , so , it 's online right now ? Yeah , yeah . Oh , and I chain mailed the entire OSU history department with the link , so ... ( RICH LAUGHING ) LAURA : really ? That 's awesome . Hey , man , you 're good , huh ? Appreciate it . Thank you . SIeestak underground , baby . Okay . Thanks . Thank you . Peace out . Y 'aII be good . Laura . Oh , my God . LAURA : Oh , this is so good . unbelievable . Yes . May I please have the number in San Jose , california , channel 6 , KSOJ . Can you help me remember this ? 5-5-5-0-1-8-6 . Mmm-hmm . Who 's that , your reporter friend ? RICH : Come on , San Francisco . please . San Francisco ! ( HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO ) They didn 't take it . I mean ... Nobody stops for hitchhikers anymore . They 've all seen too many crazy movies and read too many stories about all the weirdoes out there . You know what I think ? Huh ? honestly ? You 're gonna get old school on them . I mean , I think ... Let 's get old school on them , come on . DRIVER : Where you headed ? Hi . San Francisco . AII right . AII set with sensors ? should be reading his field now . HOWELL : There you go . He 's putting out about 15 volts . Let 's put in the mullet . HAMMAKER : That 's odd . Why isn 't he going after them ? Maybe he 's not hungry . No , that isn 't it . We 've been withholding food . Why would you do that ? We 're trying to prompt his hunting behavior and measure the electrical charge . well , you don 't need to starve him . He 'II zap the fish on his own . miles , I appreciate you being here . But I want you to stand over there , please . ( SNEEZING ) What was that ? HOWELL : I 'm pretty sure he sneezed . I don 't think he likes this . miles , get back , you 're distracting him . I know it 's tough , but you need to let us do our work . bless you . Thanks . You 're the guy that goes to del Mar Academy , right ? Oh , yeah . I guess . You got arrested or something , right ? I go to Eisenhower . I heard about that . Pretty crazy . It wasn 't that crazy . I mean , well , we did steal a car , I guess . stole a car ? I 'm CaitIin , by the way . miles . So , why aren 't you down in the critter lab with all the big brains ? Oh , you know , just taking a break . Lot of research to do . Kicked you out , huh ? Yeah , kinda . It 's not Iike they 're gonna let you stand in the way of their big discovery or anything . I mean , he was my discovery . It 's all about revisionist history , dude . No . No , no , no . Dr. bloom and I have a deal . Maybe you don 't know Dr. bloom as well as you think you do . This is good . Okay . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) hello ? Hi , Laura , it 's Ann Tracy . Hey , Ann ! Hi , how ... Yeah , thank you so much for calling me back . How are you ? Good . I got married . really , congratulations . That 's great . Yeah , last month . Oh , that 's really wonderful , Ann . Listen , Ann , I ... I have a question for you . I have this tape that I think is potentially newsworthy and I would really like to bring it by your office and show it to you . Okay , sure . Great . Do you still remember how to get here ? Yes . Yes , I do . Great . Well , I 'll see you in a while . Are we on ? Yes . AII right . LAURA : We were rescued from the Coast Guard , Iike , you know , two days ago . ANN : Yeah . And so here we are , I mean , basically . ANN : Wow . That 's a pretty crazy story . RICH : Yeah . It 's actually a true story , too . LAURA : Yes . Oh , thank you . And this other guy , Jackson . Jackson , yes . He just vanished ? well , yes . We 're not sure what happened . Right , but maybe you could , you know , get to the Coast Guard and like , talk to them , poke around , find out what happened to him ? well , yeah , but let 's take a look at your footage first . Sure . Sure . absolutely . LAURA : Okay , so , I just have to sort of fast forward some of this 'cause I 've documented the entire experience . Mmm-hmm . So just bear with me . Okay . There , there . ( ON TAPE ) This is Dr. Laura Daughtery and Rich Connelly . So tell me , what am I looking at ? It 's pretty impressive , isn 't it ? It 's a new marine vertebrate . A new species at the bottom of the ocean . A carnivore . So it eats ... Everything . What is this ? What am I looking at ? I don 't get it . It 's a new species , Bret . Why is that news ? Does it eat people ? Yes . Yes , actually . Eating people is good . We can use that , right ? But the real thing is that it 's an ecological threat . And I think ... So is hairspray . But hairspray doesn 't eat people . LAURA : It 's different than hairspray . You 're saying you were down how deep ... LAURA : 5,000 feet , actually . It killed his brother , Bret . What ? Wait , wait , wait . That thing ? RICH : Not that one . It ate your brother ? Hey , listen , nobody got ... You built your own submarine ? It 's actually a bathysphere , which is a slightly different structure ... AII right , so , this is my copy , right ? Yes , you can keep that . And we know how to get in touch with you ? LAURA : Yes . absolutely . Have a good day . LAURA : Thank you . So , we 'II let you know . LAURA : Yes . Where are you gonna be ? We 'II be at The FairchiId . Okay . But nobody can know that . Mum 's the word . Right , but seriously , Ann ? seriously . Nobody can know that . It doesn 't leave this room . Okay , thank you . Thank you very much for your time . Mmm-hmm . WITHROW : Right , yeah . So , what do you think ? American Nessie . Oh , come on , this story 's too good to check . Look , I 'm asking bill . He 's the science reporter , okay ? Oh , yeah , I can use this . Yeah . HAMMAKER : Exaggerated rostraI organ must give it heightened eIectro-sensory perception . medial location between the eyes measuring at 6.3 centimeters . The mouth can open real wide for taking prey . MILES : Is he okay ? The gland is here , on the anterior edge of the scapula . He 's fine , miles . But he 's not moving . We had to sedate him . It 's safer that way . tell me what you 're doing . We 're just exploring his healing properties , that 's all . HAMMAKER : Dr. bloom . Come on , now . You shouldn 't be in here right now . It 's just a needle biopsy . He 'II be fine . I should be in there with him . No , Nim gets too riled up when you 're around . That 's because he knows me . That 's right , you 've bonded , you 've raised him . It 's what we call imprinting . And that 's a bad thing ? No , I just think it wouId be best if you kept out of the lab . At least while we 're doing research . But you 're always doing research . This is an important discovery . It 's not time to be selfish . Taking another break ? Yeah , guess you were right . congratulations . Wanna see something cool ? What are you doing ? You 're into critters and all that , you 'II like this . Nice , huh ? The jelly did that . No way . Mmm-hmm . North shore last summer . Man-of-war rolled up on me in between sets . Touch it . It 's all smooth . I 've got a scar . Not from a jellyfish , but ... What is that , a bite ? Yeah . Dog ? Yeah . Dog . cool . well , since I 'm off work , I think I 'm gonna hit the water . swell 's picked up . Why don 't you come ? I don 't surf . I couId teach you . I 've taught lots of guys . Wow , so you 're turning me down ? I guess so . No worries . See you around . RICH : There she is . Hey , guys . Hi . Guess what ? What ? They 're running with the piece . Yes ! Hey , they think this thing is really fun . Fun ? No , it 's not a cute piece . I mean it 's not ... It 's not a " cat in a tree " kind of thing . So , what are you saying , are you not interested ? LAURA : Of course we 're interested , Ann . I 'm just ... I 'm saying it 's not a fun ... Perfect . I 'm going to get a crew here in about an hour . What ? Okay , so , right away ? Yeah . We 'II put you in the ballroom . It 'II be great . And we 'II have your video streaming online . Oh , we 've actually got it streaming on a website already . You wanted eyes on this ? Yeah ! You 're gonna get it . RICH : That 's cool . LAURA : Great . Hey , we could really use a laptop . Do you think you could get your hands on one ? We might need some clothes to change into . No problem . Anything you need . There 's just one more thing . I was just off the phone with the Coast Guard . They found your friend 's boat . really ? Where ? Off the coast of Long Beach . They e-maiIed these photos . Long Beach . That 's 1,000 miles away . RICH : california , isn 't it ? They said it looks like there was a struggle . Yeah , I mean , these are shell casings here . Is he ... They don 't know . Sorry . What do you mean , they don 't know ? How ... Where is he ? He wasn 't on board . AII they found was the boat . ( GATE CREAKING ) ( DOG BARKING ) phil . Genius . phil ? Who 's phil ? What are you doing here ? I have a surprise for you . Come on . I can 't go anywhere . I 'm grounded for , Iike , another six months . If my folks come home and I 'm not here ... Come on . Back in the day you stole a car , remember ? Go get your stuff . Go on . How did you know where I Iive anyways ? I sneaked your work file . Oh , you 're like a total criminal , huh ? You 're the one that 's on work release . No . Oh , community service . Oh . Hey , check what else I sneaked . I thought maybe we could go see your lizard after hours . No penciInecks . cool . You can hold on tighter . Hey , honey , listen . I was thinking , science chic or business casual ? Yeah . That one . That one 's nice . I Iike that . You know what ? You 're right . This color isn 't right for you anyway . ( RICH CHUCKLES ) Hey , you know what ... I forgot your name . But we 're gonna need a couple chairs here , if you get a chance . Now , you see Dr. Daughtery , she should be sitting over here . LAURA : No , no , actually , we 're ... I think ... I think one 's good . Thank you . What ? Come here . We 've got to get another chair . I just ... Rich ? Yeah ? Even after all that we 've been through together , we still have two very different takes on this thing . And I don 't wanna ... I don 't wanna confuse people . Confuse people ? What 's that supposed to mean ? It 's television , you know ? And ... I guess there 's an image , and a credibility to project that is ... I see . So what are you saying ? That I 'm gonna get up there and make us look crazy ? Rich don 't get mad . I 'm only trying to ... I 'm not mad . Who 's mad ? I 'm not mad . We were down there in that thing , I told you we were gonna be all right , and it was all part of the plan , didn 't I ? Didn 't I ? And it was . And we made it out . Okay , just fine . I know . That 's true . That is ... Look , the only reason we got those tapes is because of what I did . Yeah , I know that 's true . Okay , then . What are you doing ? What are we talking about ? I mean ... Rich , we have a videotape of a sea monster . It 's really not the most believable thing to begin with . And I think that to put a scientist out there , it gives it a more credible face . AII right . WITHROW : AII right I 'm here and I 'm ready . folks , Iet 's clear it out , okay ? Where is Dr. Daughtery ? Go on . Go get ' em , Doc . Hi . Hi . How are you ? LAURA : Okay , Rich , here we go . To the top of the countdown , now , and we conclude with an amazing rescue at sea . I know , I know , amazing rescues at sea are a dime a dozen . But how about saving two people bailing out from what amounts to a backyard submarine ? And then it gets interesting . The wild tale of what lies beneath from our correspondent , Bill Withrow , in San Francisco . Sea monsters have been a part of our storytelling tradition since man first set sail on the open seas . They are the stuff of legends , tall tales , myth . Or are they ? Humans have explored less than 10 % of our oceans . There 's an entire world deep beneath the sea , a world far larger than our own . Could this world be inhabited by giant unseen predators ? One woman from Sausalito , California believes such creatures are in existence and she says she has the evidence to prove it . That looks natural . Yeah , I ... I had to ... I had to do it , Iike , three times 'cause I kept looking at the camera . It 's okay . WITHROW : Three days ago Dr. Daughtery and a friend were pulled from the icy waters of the North Pacific after a harrowing deep water dive . A dive where she claims to have captured video footage of something in the deep . Something that threatens our very existence . Quite an adventure , huh ? Yeah . How did you get that video footage ? Two colleagues and I built a bathysphere out of salvaged material . WITHROW : Now , bathysphere is a small submersible , with no propulsion ? That 's right , that 's right . It 's tethered to a steel cable and then simply lowered down . Right . And in your case , about a mile . We ... that 's right . We sailed out to where we presumed the animals were gathering and we went down there and made a videotape . It sounds so simple . And yet you almost died in the process . Yeah , shortly after we had an encounter with a pod of the creatures . Our cable snapped . And we were stranded on the sea floor . Hey , you look good . Thanks . I really didn 't think that we would make it out alive . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Yeah ? WITHROW : ( ON TV ) But she did make it back . Back from a watery grave with video footage of a new , amazing species in what she describes as a mating ritual . Now , what you are about to see has not been edited in any way . Is it a sea monster ? Judge for yourself . This is Dr. Laura Daughtery and Rich Connelly , 4,000 feet below the surface , amidst a pod of the new vertebrates . Their lengths range from 100 feet to 175 . This tape has been examined by our video experts . They say it 's unaltered , the genuine article . And furthermore , they say these things are real . Absolutely . There you go . That 's what I 'm talking about . Yeah . That 's what I 'm saying . Genuine article , huh ? WITHROW : So what are they ? Where are they from ? LAURA : I can 't actually speak of its origin , but I can tell you that it is a new species , it is a new marine vertebrate . And a 1 75 feet ? The ones that I observed , yes . Here 's a question . Do you think it could be a leftover dinosaur ? partly . explain that . I was able to obtain tissue samples . And we compared its DNA to various other fossil records . WITHROW : Mmm-hmm . And we found it was very similar to something called a Liopleuridon . An extinct animal . Presumed extinct , yes . WOMAN : We found them . A hotel near Nob hill . Want us to bring them in ? WITHROW : We brought Dr. Daughtery 's video to Robert Vanderwal ... We 're past that . ... at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association to see what he had to say . Very intriguing . Oh , man , this doesn 't look good . I 've met Dr. VanderwaI before . He 's an excellent scientist . I think the idea of the leviathan , the kraken , is very powerful in the human psyche . It 's an exciting idea , it sells . WITHROW : We like a good monster story . VANDERWAL : Exactly . But that 's all it is , a story . This guy 's a jerk . If there were huge sea monsters running around out there , don 't you think we would have seen some kind of evidence by now ? I address this . I address this . WITHROW : Evidence , Dr. Daughtery says , she 's seen first hand . These creatures will have a profound impact on food supplies , shipping , natural resources , international relations . Within six months , we will be on the brink of an ecological and an eventual humanitarian disaster . What do you say to that ? I say consider the source . What is that supposed to mean ? By that he means Dr. Daughtery 's standing in the academic community . Her PhD in Marine Biology from the University of Hawaii was rescinded after charges she plagiarized her thesis . Charges she denies . LAURA : I have the proof . They have to discredit me somehow . WITHROW : By planting this material in your thesis ? That 's part of the cover-up . That might make you appear as a conspiracy nut . I realize that it might be difficult for people to trust me . But trust your eyes . My eyes see an unemployed woman with Flash animation software . WITHROW : Trust your eyes , Keith . Either way , I 'm canceling my trip to Belize . Hate to be eaten on my birthday . Just don 't go swimming below 5,000 feet and you 'll be fine , Bill . Be with us tomorrow night when our special live guest will probably be the Jersey Devil . Good night and good luck . ( NIM SQUAWKING ) MILES : Are you sure this is okay ? I thought you liked to live dangerously . Yeah . Just not when I 'm on probation . It 'II be okay . Here . hold this while I change . A little bit higher . No peeking . I 'm not . Aren 't you supposed to be ? My hands are so totally pruned . Let me see yours . Yours aren 't wrinkled at all . Weird . ( BANGING ) well , I hope this was fun for you two . MILES : Dr. bloom ... Dad , I can explain . Dad ? caitlin , not one more word . Get him out of there . Nim , get over here . PAUL : miles , I thought you were smarter than this . You wouldn 't let me see him . So you broke in . Endangered his safety , your safety , potentially contaminated the habitat . Do you know what it costs to drain and clean this tank ? I 'm sorry , miles , but I think it wouId be best for everyone if you stopped coming to the aquarium . Yeah , it 's a real good thing we decided to play that science angle 'cause , boy , you get my face on camera and just the credibility goes right out the window . You know , what , Rich , man , I didn 't know they were gonna make it like an infotainment piece . ( SIGHING ) How was I supposed to ... I don 't know , but it was like Shark Week . Oh , man . Nobody 's going to take it seriously now . Hey . What ? Look at this . Look . You see that counter ? Oh , my God . I mean , are you kidding ? And look , they got forums and everything . Huh ? It 's getting out there . It 's getting out there . Come on , get on . I 'II take you home . No , thanks . Look , I 'm sorry , all right ? It 's not Iike I knew he was gonna be there . It 's not your fault . When he cools off , I 'II talk to him about your pet . This is what no one gets . He 's not my pet . Okay , he 's the missing link or whatever . Forget it . You sure you don 't want a ride ? It 's not that far . I can walk . Okay . Maybe I 'II see you tomorrow . I don 't know . I can 't go back . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Who is it ? MAN : Front desk . I have a fax here for you . Rich , are you expecting a fax or something ? RICH : Huh ? What ? I said , are you expecting a fax ? RICH : No , not me .

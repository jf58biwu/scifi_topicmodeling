Usually ... Veridian Dynamics . Veridian Dynamics . Life . Veridian Dynamics . Life . Better . : Sub : exizor fatbrat : : for TV4User.de : I have the best job in the world . We want to make a metal that 's as hard as steel but can bounce like rubber ... and is edible . We can do that . I 'm the head of a research and development department for one the largest companies in America , Veridian Dynamics . Veronica 's my boss . We need a mouse that can withstand temperatures up to 195 degrees . We can do that . Uh , a computer mouse or a live mouse ? I 'll get back to you . Every day there 's something new , waiting to be discovered . Computer mouse . Easier . We do everything - industrial products , biomedical , cryogenics , defense technology . We want to weaponize a pumpkin . Then so do I. Because ? There 's a country with whom we do business that grows a great deal of pumpkins and would welcome additional uses for them ... As well as cheaper ways to kill their enemies . Well , finally the pumpkin gets to do something besides Halloween . Pie . Halloween and pie . I 've been at Veridian 3 years . Last year , I got a promotion , and now I run a team of some of the smartest people in the world . There we go . Okay , people . We need to turn this simple , festive gourd into a killer . I 've asked Dr. Bhamba to take a look at how nature does it because nature is a fantastic killer of things . Dr. Bhamba . Thank you . Nature attacks and annihilates the pumpkin with powdery mildew disease , which can be mutated and designed to attack human cell structure , causing enemy soldiers to grow a magnificent , soft downy coating and die ... As mold . Oh , my god . Spores in uniforms . I think we get the picture . Uh , Cindy , Lester , Jerry , you 're with Dr. Bhamba on this . The rest of you , you 're welcome . Ted , the drones working on the spy drone came up with this cheap fabric . Find another use for it . Well , it 's good texture , coloration . Maybe a breakfast meat . Are you serious ? We want to be in that business . No . Y-you have to lighten up . Maybe I 'm too funny . Maybe I was joking about not getting your joke . This is Lem . He 's a genius . Seriously . For 10 years , Lem has been research partners with ... Phil , who 's also a genius . I 'm so angry about the toilet paper . Why couldn 't they leave it next to the toilet ? That proximity was so elegant . They think if it 's harder to reach , that we 'll use less of it . They 've destroyed going to the bathroom for me . It used to be just a weird human function . Now it 's actively stressful . Okay , look , just take the roll off of the dispenser and bring it with you before you sit . - That 's what I do . - What ? That 's not normal , Phil . It becomes normal ... If you keep doing it . Everything does . Look , you can put up with their crap if you want to . That 's fine . That 's who you are . But I 'm not like that . I 'm a fighter . I fight stuff like this . - No , you don 't . - Shut up , Phil . I would if I thought I could win . No , because remember there was that thing last week that you thought you could win and you still didn 't fight ? Remember ? With the sandwich ? Yeah , I should 've fought that . - I thought so . - Hey , fellas . See if you can make this fabric into a line of office chairs . It 's very strong and , well , dark . Do you think I don 't fight injustice enough ? Is this about the sandwich ? Because I think , instinctively , you knew you wouldn 't have won that . Your mom 's tough . She once killed a bat with a " People " magazine . That is tough , but ... one thing she 's not ? Someone who can create something out of nothing , like you can . So make me an office chair . - He 's a better man than you . - Agreed . The next step for any product is testing . Testing is one of the things Linda does for us . People are squirming . The fabric 's not comfortable . Squirming ? Or ... are they just enjoying it so much , they want their whole body to rub against it ? Ted , I know you 're an RD legend with magical RD powers . But the chair ? Just ... no . Never give up . That 's what I always tell my daughter . She tells me to stop telling her , but I tell her I can 't , because that would be giving up . Look at these numbers . You scared me . - What 's with the creamer ? - Nothing . They 're mine . What 's up ? Productivity increase when people use the chairs . I like creamer . I 've only worked here 6 months . Is there a rule about that I should know ? When people can 't get comfortable , they don 't daydream or get distracted , so they 're more productive . And more filled with hate . And the scratchier the fabric ... The more uncomfortable people are and the harder they work . Get it off me ! - Get it off me ! Get it off ! - Up to a point , then they go mad . The Focus Master Over 1,000,000 pre-sold Is it wrong to invent a deadly pumpkin or an irritating chair that makes people work harder ? The thing is , work 's not about right and wrong . It 's about success ... or failure . Your department 's using too much creamer . Does it matter ? It 's not " Katrina " , but it is a problem . Ted , there 's been a spill ... oh , hi , - Veronica . It 's nothing . - Hi , Phil . Actually , you 're the reason I 'm here . - Oh , really ? - Yes . - You can go now . - But- - I 'm here to talk about you , not to you . I 'm sorry . We want to freeze Phil . - Excuse me ? - Phil . The company wants to cryonically freeze him , just for a year , to see if it 's possible . We think it is . You think it 's possible ? Yes , Mr. Negative , we do . We have developed a chemical which allows us to rapidly freeze live animal tissue without it exploding . And , fingers crossed , we 're ready for human testing . Your presentation sucks . And why Phil ? Well , for PR reasons , they wanted an employee . And , in the unlikely event something goes wrong , well , there are people here we would , you know , miss more . You be sure to tell him that when you try to get him to do it . I see where this is going . Your guys will do anything for you , Ted . They 've got ... what 's that thing again ? Underlings have it . Loyalty . This is huge for us . You need to make it happen . Well , I 'll try . But Phil hates the cold and he freaks out in small spaces , so this assignment is not ideal for him . Yeah , well , they originally suggested Lem , but ... freeze the black guy ? They 're not stupid . If I 'm gonna ask Phil to do something potentially dangerous , I need to make sure that it 's potentially safe . So I 've asked Linda to check out the data . No , the zebra and the toaster are friends ... I have to go . No , that makes the toaster too mean . He 's not a sociopath . He just doesn 't want to make toast anymore . Hi . Is that a new shirt ? Oh , that 's cool . Let 's pretend that that phone call wasn 't odd . I 'm trying to write a children 's book , and my illustrator doesn 't get ... most of it . Well , what 's , uh , not to get ? A toaster that doesn 't want to make toast . And , of course , there 's a zebra . You do the same thing every day . You please everyone around you . At some point you say : " Making toast is fine , it 's opened some doors , but I need more . " " So I 'm - - I 'm running away . " I don 't know how . I 'm , plugged into a wall , I don 't have legs , but I 'm doing it . " You totally get the toaster , and his complicated love / hate relationship with the outlet . Who has all the power . - That 's lame . - You laughed . Yeah . - So , freezing Phil ? - You want to know about Phil ? It 's probably okay ... If he can get past minus - 20 degrees without his eyes bursting . That would be the first sign of trouble . This is a great company , isn 't it ? Freezing its employees . Employee . They 're only freezing one . For now . Do you know that they send us the phone bills for our non-work-related calls ? They don 't charge us for ' em . They just want us to know that they know we 're making ' em . Can a company be bitchy ? - Is that why you steal creamer ? - Yes . It 's an act of rebellion . I also scratched the words " place scrotum here " On the lunch room table , but then , you know , that just became the thing to do . - You have the best cubicle . - Yeah , and we have been in all of them . Except Cindy 's . Whoa . Cindy . No way . No . I 've been in there , twice . She got so mad the first time , I had to do it again . I 'm definitely going in there sometime , twice also ... as well . So we heard rumors something 's gonna be done to Phil ? Yeah , and I just so want it to be something good . Why do they want to freeze me ? I didn 't do anything . No , Phil , it 's not a punishment . It 's-it 's an honor . You 've been chosen to be a pioneer , to go someplace no one 's ever gone before ... And come back . I don 't know . I can talk to my wife about it . Will I keep getting paid ? She 's going to want to know that . Of course . I assume . I mean , technically , it is work . I 'll check . You shouldn 't freeze Phil . This is my daughter Rose . She knows everything . Honey , it 's exciting . It 's gonna be a huge breakthrough in science . - I like Phil . - Maybe you 'll like him even more when he 's frozen . I like him the temperature he is . Phil came to my birthday . It 's wrong to freeze someone who comes to your daughter 's birthday . Well ... - Did you do your math homework ? - Yes . - 6 times 8 ? - Yes , that was one of them . Would you do it ? Would you do something like this and leave me ? When Rose was four , her mom left us to go save the world . That 's been hard for Rose . Frankly , not so great for the world , either . Hey . I would never leave you , ever . I know . We 've discussed this . You 're a great dad . But it 's wrong to ask Phil to do something you wouldn 't do . You 're right . You 're always right because stupidly , I taught you right and wrong . Just tell ' em you don 't want to do it . They can 't force employees to participate in human experiments . - They lost that court case . - But I want to do it . What ? Phil , that 's crazy . Thank you . See ? I 'm not the only one . It is only for a year , Lem . I 'll just stand perfectly still so I don 't accidentally go on living my life without you . - Moron . - Look , Phil . I might 've sold you a little too hard yesterday , and-and that was ... - Wrong . - No . No , you were right . This is my chance to be a pioneer . My wife thought it would be exciting , too , which surprised me , because she 's normally a deeply and relentlessly negative person . Mrs. Moron . At least I have a Mrs. Moron . Who 's in your life , Lem ? Why are you being so mean ? And so ... They froze Phil . What I do now ... I do for science . And so I do not ask for your concern . All I ask is for your respect ... Respect as a scientist , respect as a friend ... Respect as a man . Oh , god ! I think this is it ! I 've never seen a man explode from the inside . A rabbit , an eel , a goat , a monkey and a reindeer , but that 's all . I 'm out . This is normal . Every company does stuff like this . Right ? Does Phil look like he 's in pain ? Bummer to have to stay like that for a year . I don 't think you 're crazy for stealing creamer . Watch closely . Minus - 20 is when the eyes might burst . He 's been like this for three days now . They promised him he could stay in the lab with his friends , so that 's good , right , buddy ? Creepy . - They 're moving him tomorrow . - What ? - Where ? - I think the basement . Although , there 's been talk of India . Hello . No , I can talk . Phil thawed out ? How ? It 's very technical . - Is he okay ? - He 's fine . It 's just ... something 's not quite right . Next we looked at Methyl Thiazole-4 , which we assumed would ... So this thing with Phil , making that stupid face and yelling - they think it 's distracting . I guess in hindsight they shouldn 't have vitrified his brains . Look , i 'm not gonna play the blame game with you . The point is , they need you to let him go . What ? Have you ... been avoiding me ... since ... you know , you held my hand ? No . And-and I didn 't hold your hand . I ... held on to your hand after you held my hand . Okay . That 's how we 're playing it ? We 're gonna play it stupid ? Okay , I ... I don 't know how it happened . I do . I was standing there like this , and you took my hand like this , and that 's ... how it happened . - Linda . - Ted ... I used up my office affair . - What now ? - You only get one , otherwise you 're that guy that sleeps around . And about a year ago , I used mine . Ted , that was an excellent presentation . Everything you said was just so concise and exactly ... I think you and I should have sex . If you want . Look at me . I 'm so nervous , I 'm shaking like a leaf . - No , no , you 're not . - No . Is that a problem ? I don 't get nervous . I try . It just doesn 't come out . I guess that makes me ... vulnerable . No , you 're not vulnerable . No . So ... where does that put us ? Ted , it 's okay . Really . I don 't care . I work for you . It would be ... Besides , only an idiot would have an affair with their boss . Pretty girl . Although , she makes a lot of non-work-related calls , which I think makes her less attractive . Listen , Veronica , about firing Phil , I don 't think we should rush into anything . You 're right . Wait until the end of business Friday . It 'll be easier for payroll . - You 're kidding , right ? - No . Now they want you to fire Phil . That 's what I 'm supposed to do , yep . Do grown-ups even care about right and wrong ? Did you brush your teeth ? Don 't change the subject . - Hello , Linda . - Hi . Did I surprise you ? I didn 't mean to surprise you . I 'm just a friendly person . I didn 't think you knew my name . Well , of course I know your name . I know a lot about you . Linda ... Katherine ... Zword ... ning ... ling . Zwordling . Fine . You know your name better than I do . Yay . Ted , I can 't have you sleeping with Linda . - What ? - It could embarrass me , plus I may not be done with you yet . Hey , guys . Hi , Phil . I hear you 're blinking again . Good for you . - Why is he still here ? - Because , Veronica , I 'm not firing him . - But they want you to fire him . - I don 't care . It 's just wrong . So then you 're saying no to them ? That 's an interesting career choice . Phil doesn 't deserve to be fired . He 's incredibly smart . He 's hardworking . He let us freeze him ! He 's the last guy that deserves to be fired , and i 'm standing by him . Dude . You 're not helping me . Okay , I 'll talk to them . But what you 're doing is gonna hurt their feelings , and when their feelings get hurt , they hurt the ones they love . And they love you , Ted . Well , then maybe I should talk to them . No . They don 't want to talk to you when you 're like this . : Sub : exizor fatbrat : : for TV4User.de :

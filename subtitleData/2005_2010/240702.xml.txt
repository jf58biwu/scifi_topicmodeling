Hey , Sergeant ! Sergeant Morita ! - Hostiles ! - What ? Attack ! Attack ! Hold up ! What 's that ? Have no fear ! Attack ! WARRlNG STATES period 1549 According to the observation post at Mt . Fuji , the cap clouds that appeared this summer show no signs ofi dissipating , setting a record ofi 90 days . Today , the Japanese islands are ... . Good night . - See ya tomorrow . - OK . Hey , boss . With these sales , the head office will put us in the warehouse . I 'd consider that a promotion . We 're gonna have to cut costs . Tell the part-timers we have to let ' em go . Me ? You 're the manager . Who else would do it ? I 'm not good at confrontation . Well , I gotta go . Good night . See ya tomorrow . I 'm sorry we 're closed . We 're from the Health Department . - Hey , boss ! - Hmm ? - Can we speak to you ? - Yeah . That 's right . Kashima . Someone who 's eaten here recently has signs of food poisoning . It 's all right . I 'll handle it . Go home . OK , boss . Government bureaucrats , huh ? Former-Lieutenant Kashima , isn 't it ? I 'm with the Ground Self-Defence Force , Major Mori . Ground Force Research , Lieutenant Kanzaki So you are bureaucrats . And ? Do you remember Colonel Matoba ? He died during a training exercise . That was two years ago . Officially , yes What 's that mean ? Are you familiar with the solar maximum ? What 's that ? Every 1 1 years , there is a peak in solar activity that emits plasma which interferes with electronic equipment . This can cost lives if it were to occur during battle . That 's why we 're developing a system in which we can create an artificial magnetic field that would change the direction of the plasma in order to avoid interference . Special Unit 3 , led by Colonel Matoba , was participating in the experiment . - What is that ? - It 's what it looks like . But Matoba and his soldiers are ... alive . I don 't get it . They were ... transported . Transported ? The vegetation and the soil dated back about 500 years . That can 't be . Three days later ... . It changed back ? Take a closer look . Our investigation revealed that this individual was from the past . He 's what ? From 1547 . It was the Age of Civil War . And that 's ... where the others are now . Operation Romeo ? It 's a Special Unit rescue mission . And just how do you intend to rescue them ? Using ... another time slip . Time slip ? Abnormal solar activity was registered three days ago . In a week , we will be at exactly the same plasma levels as the day of the accident . We will use that to send ourselves back in time . We want you ... to act as an observer during the undertaking . Well , don 't you think this whole thing is a little sudden ? We filed the request right away ... But there was some concern ... about a civilian . We just got the go-ahead . Look . What is it ? Some people call it an " imaginary space " , but we simply refer to it as the " hole " , to keep it simple . Hole ? A hole that can absorb anything that exists . Even light and matter . When we first discovered it , it was about the size of an egg . We sealed off this area , so word doesn 't leak to the public . And this isn 't the only one . It 's like , giant insect holes ... all over the country . It began when ... Matoba and his unit first disappeared . The past is attacking us . Attacking us ? How ? Matoba 's existence and his actions in the past are affecting everything in the world as we know it today . Like killing your parents before you were born just to make sure that you never exist . I believe that history has the power to repair itself if the damage is small enough . If not , I 'm afraid Matoba 's existence in history certainly would have caused the instant destruction of our world . However , it 's taken this long for the threat to appear ... . We must assume then that the colonel is currently interfering with history . If we don 't do something , Japan ... No , the entire world ... will end up in there ... and vanish . Our only hope then is to succeed with this rescue . So which is it ? Are you going there to save Colonel Matoba ... or is this really about saving the world from the Colonel ? So , which one is it ? I knew there was something strange about this . I came because you said that it was a rescue . Now you say he 's attacking us . Get your story straight . The entire world is on the verge of destruction . Don 't you even care ? Matter of fact ... It can ... disappear for all I care . Gotta go ... It 's a work day . Here , boss . OK , what 'll ya have ? - I 'll have the beef teriyaki . - OK , that 's my favourite too . Who had the chicken skewers ? - Just put it here . - And the sake ? Right here . Pardon . I am Shichibei linuma , serving Lord Saito Dosan , retainer of the state of Mino . Talk normal , will ya ? I 'm no warrior , that whole warrior thing doesn 't exist in this day and age . They say it would not trouble you if this world were to end . Why is it you ... continue on then ? As long as man has life , he protects . To protect my lord , I will kill , without hesitation . Mine is the Age of War . But what of this Age of Peace ? You are free to live as you please , without classes or lords . You are bound to no one . Now , that this world of yours has been threatened ... you find no purpose in defending it . If that is the integrity on which you live ... Then you should be the one ... then it 's clear you should be the one who is to vanish . This is where they disappeared . That was two years ago . I 've been waiting for any chance at rescue . We cannot let this chance go by . Even if we do find them , how do we return ? The field was here 74 hours and 27 minutes . If you stand in the place you arrived , you should , in theory , be returned . Yeah , but that 's just a theory . You know ... I had the power to stop that experiment that day . If I had stopped it ... nothing of this would 've occurred . I sent Colonel Matoba to the past . I 've got to make it right . But why are you dragging me into this ? Because the Colonel created a warfare program called " D-3 " . You 're still the only one who has defeated it . You see , if we 're going to rescue Matoba and his men ... then we 're going to need your assistance . Please help us . The objective of Operation Romeo is to rescue and restore . In other words , we 're going to rescue Unit 3 ... and restore history to its original state . We 'll be travelling back in time four hundred and fifty-six years . We estimate that we will arrive in the year 1549 . That 's two years after Special Unit 3 arrived there . Avoid all contact with the locals . We will be armed with low-impact ammunition . Cartridges and bullets are made of biodegradable cellulose in order to leave no evidence of our presence during that time . That 's all . Now , I 'd like to introduce this man . He 'll join us as an observer on this detail . Kashima Yusuke , former Lieutenant . Kashima . Major , the real ammo ? Will we have any ? Absolutely . But ... it 's only for use in an emergency . Just emergencies ? Do you have a problem with that ? No . You 're an observer here . You 'll watch your mouth , got it ? Extending shield generator arm . Units 1 and 2 , operations normal . All systems normal . Roger , control . All units mount up ! All units , final preparations for mobilisation . Squire Kashima . We meet again . Yeah . Ground crew ... clear . Romeo Units , we 're go . Roger . This is control . Commence Operation Romeo Activating magnetic shield generator . Shield activated . The plasma volume is exceeding shield endurance levels . Full output . 126 ... 132 ... 145 ... 157 ... The fog is confirmed . Initiate anti-flash measures . Prepare for impact . This is Lead Unit . All units report . This is LAV . WAPC systems down ! Status ? All systems except for radio are down . All ground and air units report the same . Synchronize watches at 1400 hours . Currently , 1359 . 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Mark . 1400 . We have exactly 74 hours 26 minutes . All units , check equipment . Unit 3 set up command post . Air units set up land markers . - Land marker set . - Good . Let 's go . Yes , sir . Once that sensor is set ... Get back to base . OK . Sergeant Mikuni , look ! We 're not supposed to interact with locals ! Power lines to command post connected and operational . Connection is good . Roger . He 's OK . He 'll wake up soon . Who approved this ? Contact with the locals is not allowed ! - Well , uh ... - The kid was dying . Kashima , it 's not our era and you know it . You telling me you woulda let him die ? You were an officer once . You must 've followed orders then . Security surveillance system operational . What 's the chopper for ? To survey the area . The radar system is back . But it 's too dangerous in daylight ! We 're proceeding according to plan . I 'm the one in charge here . Omega 1 's status ? Omega 1 is at bearing 3-2-0 . This is Omega 1 . Holding altitude ofi 1500 metres . - Survey the area completely . - Roger . I see something at 1.00 , distance 2500 metres . Mt . Anmo . It 's not that far . Yeah , but what 's there ? Anmo Castle ! Hey ... Why aren 't you resting ? Anmo Castle ? It 's not on the map . You 're with the others . Isn 't that so ? You 've seen others dressed like me then ? Don 't be hasty . They are not the enemy . Oda 's army came to Suruga and attacked us . My family was killed on that day ! Oda ? You mean ... Nobunaga ? That 's right . Yamase , can you get closer ? This is Omega 1 . Approaching . What 's that ? Lieutenant , they 're attacking ! A missile ? Omega 1 return at once ! Roger . Leaving area and returning to base . I don 't get it . Second wave , incoming ! We 've lost Omega 1 on the radar . Omega 1 , do you read ? Do you read ? ! Stop ... or I 'll shoot ! We 've lost contact with Area 3 ! Intruders in Areas 1 and 2 ! They 've breached Area 7 ! We 're surrounded to the southwest ! What 's going on ? Intruders in Area 6 ! This is Taniguchi , helicopters are under attack ... Major , get everyone in the tanks ! Right ! All units ... into the vehicles ! - Yes , sir ! - Hurry ! Into the vehicles ! Evacuate ! Hurry ! - Retreat to Mt . Takaza ! - Yes , sir . You can 't . The enemy 's fortress is at Takaza ! What ? You know the area well ? Like my own village . Major ! Right ! All units follow us ! - Lead the way , kid . - My name 's not kid . It 's Tosuke ! - Hurry ! Move it ! - Yes , sir ! - WAPC , fiollow RCV units . - This is WAPC . Roger . All units , accelerate ! Clear the line ! RCV . Roger that . - We 're surrounded , Commander ! - Break through ! But ... ! That 's oil ! - Get out now ! - Right ! How goes the battle ? It appears that we have defeated many of their warriors . And our men ? Several were shot with rifles , but not one of them is dead . Shot , but not dead ? That is unusual . There is no need to fear then . Princess ! Please stop ! Kagamino , you should try it . The world looks quite different . Oh , Princess ... what will milord say if he sees you ? He will not mention it . He doesn 't look at me . Not even a glance when we pass in the hall . I wish to go outside . I want to chase a deer in the woods . Princess . You are too much like your father , I fear . The sensors are already in place . Good . 18 soldiers remaining , including the wounded . Major ... Let 's use live ammo . We are not to engage or harm any of the locals . Orders from HQ . How many of us have been killed ? We are only authorised to use live ammo ... to carry out the Unit 3 elimination ! Elimination ? That 's what you meant by " emergency " ? That was the plan from the start . It was theoretical ... that Special Unit 3 was intentionally changing history . But , even so , it doesn 't justify killing any locals . Well , at this rate , we 'll be wiped out soon ! - We must tell the men that they can ... - Why are you so anxious to kill ? Besides , any order to kill ... will be given by me . Obey your orders . It is dangerous for you to stay with us . You should return home come morning . No ! I smell the power of the heavens . My father always says that when power shifts ... there is a mysterious scent . Shifting of power , eh ? He 's not my real father , he just took me in . Your father says very interesting things ! Then do you know why Oda is here in Suruga ? Because Heaven 's Guides joined him . You mean the men from the Age of Peace ? That 's right . The men who guide the heavens . That 's what they call them . Even Saito of Mino has allied with them . His Lordship ? Also , the " Serpent " gave Lord Oda his daughter in marriage . DAY TWO , 06.48 57 HOURS AND 38 minutes remaining Intruders ! Take cover ! What now , Major ? Yoda ! Kashima ... Throw down your weapons , your lives will be spared ! Yoda ! Yoda , why are you attacking us ? Yoda , listen , we were sent here to save you ! Do as he says . Shichibei ! Shichibei , what about the child ? You may leave . You are a disgrace ! DAY TWO , 12.17 52 HOURS AND 09 minutes remaining This is the castle ? It 's not from this time . What is that ? It looks like an oil refinery . They need fuel so they make it . He is waiting in the drawing room . I have been gone long . For so long . Linuma Shichibei ... has returned home , milord . Is it true you had journeyed to the land of Heaven 's Guides , Shichibei ? - Yes , sir . - And ... there are new Guides who have arrived . Who are they ? They are the comrades of those who are serving Lord Oda . They say they have come to return them to their own land . I believe there is a man by the name of Matoba in Lord Oda 's ranks ? Matoba ? No ... there is no such Guide . He is the leader of the Guides . You speak of ... Lord Oda himself . Well , at last ... Kashima . I admit ... I thought it 'd be you . What 's going on here ? Colonel Matoba , this is a rescue mission . What are you doing ? Two years ago , we found ourselves in the heart of a battlefield . - Permission to engage ! - That 's negative ! Denied . All units , retreat ! Colonel ! My men were dying , one after another . I even thought of destroying everything and taking my own life . But what would come of our death ? Were we sent here merely to die ? No ! I resign as Colonel ... immediately . But , sir ! History , this era ... challenges us ... We will fight ! This era is a time where power ... can overthrow all . We shall ... we shall live here ! Milord ! The young warrior I had killed was Oda Nobunaga . Oda made peace by welcoming the Guides in as his men . After that , his strength grew tenfold . I was naive and underestimated him , but after one battle , I knew I was no match . Thus ... I gave him Nou as his wife . I took Dosan Saito 's daughter in marriage ... as history relates . I became ... Oda Nobunaga . History has the ability to restore itself . It absorbed the anomaly that we were and seeks to return to its course . But what kind of future actually awaits ? The Tokugawa Shogunate closed its doors in order to protect its own power . Overconfidence leads Japan into World War ll ... only to suffer a cruel defeat . Well , I will change all that . I will build a nation that 21st century citizens can be truly proud of . I do not intend on dying for a people who have long forgotten ... how to defend themselves ! - Kurebayashi , show them . - Yes , sir ! Kurebayashi ! Stand . Kanzaki ... what is that ? A battery from the satellite we used in the experiment ... the MHD . If you take the core of the unit out and then discharge it all at once ... it 's as powerful as ... a nuclear weapon . I 've already removed the protection lock . We 'll use this to induce an eruption ... it will blow Mt . Fuji apart . Far stronger than the one in 1707 , which turned the Kanto Plain into wasteland . And that 's when I ... will reconstruct this country . I want you to join us , Kashima . If we change history like that , every living soul in our era will disappear ! To be replaced by new souls ... in a world that 's better . You think this shows responsibility to the future ? That 's right . Where 's your responsibility to the people in our time ? Please , Colonel . This is just ... it 's just a massacre ! You haven 't changed at all . Kanzaki ... You were the one who sent us here . Then you should decide . Why didn 't you shoot ? Are you saying you could 've done it ? Kashima you should join us . Your lives will depend on what you decide . Yoda ! Could this be the perfect future we dreamed about with Matoba ? I was treated with courtesy and honour during my stay in their land . I am in their debt . I only ask that you spare their lives . That is not a decision for me to render . Milord ! Hurry ! Sun 's going down ! Sir ! Shichibei . I 'm so happy you 've returned . Shichibei ... You 're looking worried . Is it , by chance , the men you returned with ? Perhaps you are being thoughtful of my father and me . But are you sure ... you want to forget the long days you spent with them ? I have no choice . You were the one who told me about ... looking up at the heavens , and being able to see the countless animals chasing each other across the sky . To them , looking down from the sky , all matters on the Earth seem so small . That heart of yours , I remember how tender it is . I am a star . I am looking down on you . You can relax , Shichibei . I am the daughter of the Serpent . Live your life as you wish . You come down . You are the lord 's wife ? And if I were her ? I owe a debt to the new Guides who arrived . I thought I could repay it . You mean ... alone ? I need no one to assist me . You see I have learned , without the Guides ' tricks to help , Lord Oda is only a half-wit . You have quite a tongue for a little rodent . - Shichibei . - Yes . Follow the path you believe in , Shichibei . No one is allowed beyond this point . Stand aside . The food seized when the new guides were arrested ... Princess Nou demands it be dispersed ! Yes . DAY THREE , 07.59 32 HOURS AND 27 minutes remaining Kashima , I await your answer . This new country of yours can go to hell . In this warring era , only the strong ones are allowed to survive . - Katsuie ! - Yes , sir ! If you win , I will allow you all to return to your own era . Shichibei ... show your loyalty to Lord Oda ... and to me . Sir ! Kashima ... I 'm sorry . - Use this too . - Yes , ma 'am . Begin ! No , Kanzaki ! Get out of the way ! What are you afraid of , Shichibei ! My Lord , please open your eyes ! What did you say ? I , Shichibei , travelled to the land of peace and learned ... the meaning of the word " future " . Milord . Please listen . The future is a world of hope . I know it . I saw it ! I beg you to reconsider . Lord Saito , this man seems willing to give his life to open your eyes . What do you say ? - Doku , bring the bow . - Yes , sir . Father ! Watch out ! What 's going on ? - Get your weapons ! We 're leaving ! - Yes , sir ! - Pass these out ! - Hurry ! Mikuni ! Retrieve the other vehicles ! Hurry ! Yes , sir ! Major , the order ! Everyone is to use live rounds ! Yes , sir ! Engage ! Colonel ? Stand your ground ! To arms ! Attack ! The fool ! Nou ! - Takanashi , get the chopper ! - Yes , sir ! Hurry ! You and Matoba are insane ! We 're all soldiers ! I 'll cover for you . Go ! Major ! Major , no ! - Let 's go . - No . But we have to follow his orders . - Oh , man . I 'm out . - Me , too . Hurry ! - Let 's go ! - OK ! Shoot ! Kanzaki ! Kanzaki ! Send Dosan 's men after them . Assemble all of our men and vehicles here ! Sir ! We have 21 hours until the time slip . And I am ... the senior officer remaining . Romeo Unit is now under my command . So , here it is . We 're at less than half the strength than we began with . Which means ... we cannot complete the mission . We should withdraw to our time and regroup . However , the world we knew may no longer exist . We need to return to the castle . And rescue Kanzaki from there . Even with a minimal chance for success , I think we should try . Is anyone with me ? All right ! Proceed to stations for equipment check ! Standby for orders ! Dismissed ! Yes , sir ! They have something to defend . Just the same as you . It 's just ... there 's no way we could win a battle . So , now what ? Why do you waver ? You should do as she says . You be silent . Did your father teach you how to dodge like that too ? Who is he ? My father ? His name is Hachisuka Koroku Masakatsu . Hachisuka ? Hey ! Your father 's Hachisuka , really ? I just said so . I see . History has given us a second chance . OK . We just have to change the rules . LAST DAY , 02.34 13 HOURS AND 52 minutes remaining Have you come here to die ? I shall accept that resolve . Milord , if I could speak to you once again . I swear upon the words bestowed unto me by Princess Nou ... that I do not speak lies . LAST DAY , 13.23 3 HOURS AND 03 minutes remaining Linuma Shichibei 's severed head . He was quite brave to come back and I dealt with him right there . Kashima ? Do not be so anxious . I bring some interesting news . Kashima , is going to the capital . I see . Kyoto ? He 's going to threaten the court with their trickery . Force them into issuing a warrant that calls for your arrest at once ... which will incite the other warlords to attack this castle ! At this moment , they 're making ready to attack you . They can have this castle . I should start thinking of my own welfare ... Send the Cobras to Kyoto . Kill the Emperor and Kashima , too . Send the strike force to Kyoto as well . Yes , sir . LAST DAY , 14.25 2 HOURS AND 01 minutes remaining Sir Kashima wear this . Here . - I 'm counting on you . - Yes , sir . Let 's go . Move out . This alone has the power to kill hundreds of thousands , spoil the earth , and completely flatten Mt . Fuji . Man can be ... a terrifying beast . Is there no end to the slaughter ? LAST DAY , 14.56 1 HOUR AND 30 minutes remaining OK , it 's time . Forgive me . They hit the refinery . The strike force is under attack ! What ? To arms ! Sir Mikuni ! Go ! Sir Mikuni ! Mikuni ! I 'm OK . Look , we 'll hold our position . No one will get through . Kashima , go ! Intruders ... inside the castle ! To think that a man who can 't even make Nou happy ... wants to change the course of history ? Don 't make me laugh ! You 've switched sides . You will disarm . Freeze ! Hold it ! History is trying to right itself . You have no right to change it . Then you must defend it ! - No , don 't ! - No ! Sir Mikuni ! Fire ! Forward ! Everybody ! Silence ! I hold here a warrant for Lord Oda ! The end has come for the master of this castle ! What ? By order of the Mikado , we 're here ... to collect and bring back the head of Lord Oda ! Mikuni ! Mikuni ! Kashima ... he 's in there . Go ! I will . Mikuni ! Where 's Nou ? Milord ! My life has been saved again . What 's wrong ? Want to quit ? Kashima , you must witness ... a new era being born . In less than 20 minutes the whole world will change . Colonel Matoba ! Matoba ! Colonel , why ? The Cobra is back . Retreat ! Time slips in 18 minutes ! We could make it ! It 's no use ! I can 't unlock the timer ! What are you doing ? Bringing it with us ! Remember when we first got here electrical systems went down . This thing might stop too ! The main cable is right in front of you . Disconnect it ! Princess ! Go ! Go on ! Yoda ! Yoda ! Let 's all go ! Kashima ! Just stay alive ! Yoda ! Yoda ! Sir Kashima ! Quickly ! We need to hurry ! She 's alive ! Will you be all right ? We don 't know yet . Don 't worry . Shichibei needs to know we 'll be waiting for him . Roger ! So , will the Age of Peace be all right ? You do not have to worry about it . The future is merely the hopes of people . The answer may be up to us . Beacon in range . Descending rapidly . Stopped it ! 16TH OCTOBER 2005 , 16.31 Kashima !

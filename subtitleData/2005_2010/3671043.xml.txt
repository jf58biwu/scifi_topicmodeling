 My peaceful life was supposed to continue forever . I was content with what was real happiness . But those fun-filled days suddenly ended . And thats when revenge took over my life . Kyoshiro is dead . Who the hell are you ? Milly . You massacred my family . Welcome to Hell . Even when I take revenge , I find no peace . I 've lost my purpose in life . My Hell begins now . Milly , that 's you , isn 't it ? I need your help . My beloved was killed . Please help me get revenge . Let me go . Did they really think they could do it themselves ? Lkki , she took all the guns . If you were her , what would you do with them ? Let me see ... Either use them , or sell them . That 's right . If shes looking to sell them , shell take them to LAND . Jack , she 's really something . Her injury wasn 't that serious . She 'll be able to walk when the anesthetic wears off . Thanks . It 's unusual for you to care about someone . You haven 't visited me for a while . How 's the shotgun on your knee ? You 're not the only one who looks after it . Hey , don 't be unfaithful to me . Dont let anyone else touch the thing in your chest . You have a constant headache ? Lm used to it . You 'd better go see a doctor . I hate X-rays . I don 't want anyone to touch my head . By the way , a young girl visited you . You told her about me ? She asked me if I knew a professional killer . Because you always bring me the best weapons , I thought of you . Listen , was Jack really that good ? Sure . He was the only man who ever fascinated me with his power . He was the craziest , sexiest man in the world . Was he that strong ? Jack was brutality personified . This city became livable because of him . He targeted families and went on a killing spree . His viciousness got to all the villains in town . Then copycats began killing indiscriminately . Murders were rife , any time , anywhere . A violent city beyond police control was born . Really ? I wish Id meet Jack . You wasted your time in jail , Hyuma . Having relationships with men is beyond my comprehension , anyway . That 's a silly prejudice , Hyuma . If you werent my brother , I 'd teach you to be gay . Give me a break . The gay world is fantastic . It really is . You sound weird . Thank you for saving me . Are you alright now ? Yes . You face these things all the time ? Why ? Because I 'm a killer . But I 'm not a professional . All I did was take my revenge . Revenge ? They killed my family and ruined my body . That 's why I punished them with the brutal deaths they deserved . Now you 're being targeted by those close to your victims ? I want to take revenge , too . I have money . As I told you , I 'm not a professional . My lover was killed . Your lover ? Is it him ? What do you want me to do ? I 'm finding out who killed him . I want you to find the murderer and kill him . Are you serious ? Yes , I am . You really loved him ? Then why not do it yourself ? I 'm not as strong as you are . I guess ... I was weaker than you . But I became stronger for the ones I lost . Is it a matter of capabilities ? Or a difference in levels of passion ? I 'm mean to you . I know exactly how you feel . But I don 't kill people because I like it . I want to take my revenge , too . I won 't ask you to kill for me . But I want you to teach me how to fight . You 'll have nothing after you get your revenge . You 'll end up like me . Is that what you want ? Then let 's begin . Let 's go . You 're not bad . Take my special weapon . It 'll be useful . Duck ! You shoot , too . Use it . Join them together and lock it . Then pull the slide . What 's your name ? I 'm Haru . Haru , the secret of battle is to show no mercy . Watch carefully . We meet at last . You bitch ! Listen , lkki . Let me kill her . Ikki , she 's really something . Hyuma , never underestimate her . What the hell are you doing ? All you have to do is win . That 's all . You 're not the only one with a mechanical body . This is my revenge . Hyuma , run ! Don 't die until I kill you , bitch . Leave it to me . I 'll save you . Milly 's fine . She 's much tougher than you think . Are you her friend ? I 'm not a friend , but we sort of need each other . She was abandoned after her body was re-created . She needs a weird doctor like me to maintain her . Was she abandoned ? Milly was dying when her body was torn apart by killers . She was unconscious , on the verge of death . But someone found her , and miraculously , she survived . She didn 't even know who saved her . When she woke up in the empty hospital , she realized that half of her body was mechanized . All she felt was an extreme craving for revenge . After she gained her revenge she lost her reason to live . Now she 's the one they seek and she kills aimlessly . Then Milly brought you to me . Milly had no interest in others in the past . I was quite surprised . Maybe she sympathized with you . I think you can be her friend . I guess I can 't , because I 'm too weird . Will you give her another operation ? I 'll fiddle with her body before the anesthetic wears off . Your resilience is astounding . Because half my body is mechanized . Can I use this arm ? Sure you can . I have your brass knuckles here . Drop by the gun dealer later . Give up your chest device this time . It got totally destroyed . I couldn 't fix it . What happened to them ? You mean lkki and his gang ? They ran off , for the moment . They 're outlaws with a big cash reward on their heads . They came all this way to kill you . They hold a strong grudge against you , don 't they ? I guess so . You look somehow happy . That proves that I actually killed Jack . Are you still on about that ? Your memories are all true . You used to have a happy life with your husband and child . Did that ever really happen ? Human memories are so vague . Even our conversation could be programmed by someone . Come on . Don 't drag me into your strange delusions . Give me some aspirin . Do you still have a headache ? You took X-rays of my head , didn 't you ? Whats the result ? No problems . Nothing abnormal detected . It was perfect . I believe you . How could you even think that your brain has been mechanized ? You 're quite insane , you know . I thought I was dead , but I woke up in this stupid body . Then I found myself killing every day . Anyone would go insane . That causes your headaches . Because you think your brain is not yours . You brought some guns ? No , lm buying . Is this usable ? Sure , it 's all dusty because no one can use it . I 'll take it . And give me a set of No. 10 compressed charges . Why do you need them for ? My trump card . That 's why I hate bisexuals . Don 't worry . I 'm gay . Let 's get along with each other , bitch . It 's your mobile phone , isn 't it ? Do you know him ? He 's my lover . I knew him . Kyoshiro died , didn 't he ? How do you know about him ? Let me ask you a question . Do you know about Jack ? He 's Kyoshiro 's half brother . I hate him . Don 't say that . He 's the craziest , sexiest man in the world . Are you Jack 's friends ? Do you know who killed Jack and Kyoshiro ? I thought you didn 't know . Do you know ? Bitch , why were you with Milly ? I want her to help me get my revenge . Really ? She 's super-strong , isn 't she ? Answer my question . Milly killed both Jack and Kyoshiro . I see . So she 's still alive . I dare not enter LAND again . I 'll coax Milly out of there with this bitch . Next time , I 'll be sure to kill her . Don 't interrupt , lkki . Hyuma , you care too much about your style . The most important thing is winning . Anyway , let 's get along together so we can cut Milly to pieces . Well , bitch ? Just watch me . I 'll open it now . Watch it . Milly ? Here she comes . What are you doing ? Listen Hyuma , it 's my battle . Besides , you 'll never beat Milly with a fingerless hand . Leave it to me . Don 't leave me here . Ikki , wait . Don 't come before I tell you . So you didn 't lose your arm ? You almost died , damn cow . Where 's Haru ? She 's with Hyuma . Oh , I 've something to tell you . She got depressed to learn that you killed her lover . So you knew ? You were with her and you knew that ? You 're cool . Super cool . Let 's fight it out . I shall avenge the killing of Jack . If I kill you , will Hyuma attack me next ? He 'll never show himself . Because I 'll never be beaten . I shall win ! You 've improved your equipment , haven 't you ? I haven 't used my projectile weapons yet . I 'll do anything to win . That 's all that matters . Bitch , you 're almost there . You did it . Now unlock my handcuffs . How ? Use that gun you had . Yes , that 's it . Do it . Hey idiot ! Don 't leave me here . You did it , bitch . I 'll show you my power ! Take that ! You bitch ! What the hell are you doing ? Jack ! I shall win . I shall win without fail . Will you still fight , you cow ? If you were a man , I 'd fall in love with you . Jacks waiting for you in Hell . Say hello to Jack down there . Damn it ! Damn ! Stand up . I 'll fight you . I have no chance of beating you . You must take your revenge . It 's impossible . Impossible for me . Your lover He bled to death . Why ? He died covered in blood . Why do you say that now ? In the end , I burned his body . What do you want me to do ? Is that the best you can do ? You 're too weak . Come for me anytime , when you 're ready . You have the right to kill me . Why ? What should I do now ? Damn it ! Will you come with me ? Written Directed by Takanori Tsujimoto

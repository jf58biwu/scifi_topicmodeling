Abby ! sync : ? , 9527 journeyman Season01 Episode08 e other morning on The Today Show , there was a segment on workplace romance . Offices are the new singles ' bar . An emotional affair in the workplace- - worse than a one-night stand . - How 's Dan ? - He 's good . He 's goos . We actually have a date , so I got to get going . Oh . Where 's he taking you ? Home . He 's cooking me dinner . I shipped Zack off to a friend 's . Anyone can cook , but will he clean up , too ? Okay , okay , we 're just being mean now because we 're jealous . Katie , Dan is a keeper . Oh . Yeah . I think so , too . - Have a good time . - Bye , guys . So , she saw her mother having sex with another man ? Yeah , and I sent her into the fire . When I was 14 , I walked in on my dad taking a shower , and I couldn 't see colors for nine days . You got off easy . Abby disappeared . I read in the archives that she was last seen hitchhiking in ' 73 . Well , maybe that means you 're not done with her . Isn 't that how this works ? Uh , I hope not . Cheers . - Wow . - I took it to the ' 70s . Maybe you should have left it there . So , um , did you see Livia at the swinger 's party ? Yeah . What did you guys do ? Talk . You went to a swinger 's party and all you did was talk ? That and watch the Nixon " I am not a crook " speech on the news . It was a rush to see it on the day that it actually happened . Honey , I love that you went to a wife-swapping party and it was Nixon that turned you on . So , what , that was it , just orientation ? Yup . I report to work for real at 10 : 00 a.m. on Tuesday . They 've got me on the Board of Supervisors beat . You 're going to kill . I 'd settle for not getting fired . I think , uh , we are going to need to get some after-school carek and maybe some help around here full-time . Yeah , well .. well ... we got two incomes now . - Dan ? - Yeah ? For the first time in weeks , I feel normal . That 's good . It won 't last , I know . Enjoy it . Right here ? Yeah . Right here . Thanks for coming in . This won 't take long . Can 't think of a better way of spending my lunch hour than getting grilled by the FBI about a 30-year-old hijacking . Department policy mandates we audit your incident reports because of your brother 's involvement with McCleen 's ransom money . Why ? We have to make sure there 's no pattern of prior conflicts . Oh , come on . Can 't IA handle this ? We 're the feds , Inspector . Rock beats scissors . All right , just do me a favor and let me be the one to tell my brother . It 'd be nice if it worked that way , wouldn 't it ? How 'd your dinner go ? Good . The wine , not so much . Hmm . And your promised Candlestick Point follow-up ? Skedline 's ten minutes away . Okay . Excuse me ? I 'm looking for Dan Vasser ? You found him . Hi . Richard Garrity . I 'm with the FBI . Sorry to bother you at work . Can I ask you some questions ? Sure . So , what 's this about ? Hijacking of a commercial airliner in 1975 . - Dylan McCleen ? - Yes . I was doing a story on him , but it didn 't pan out . So , why were you doing a story on a hijacking that 's 32 years old ? Because Dylan McCleen hijacked a plane and jumped out with a parachute and 100 grand was never seen again . It 's a great story . Or maybe you found the ransom money . - What 's that ? - You tell me . Are you saying this is ransom money from the hijacking ? I didn 't say anything . - Where 'd you get it ? - From your brother . - So , where did he get it ? - From you . I don 't recall giving him anmone Unless you 're talking about losing on a round of golf . Lying a a federalgent brings a se oous def consequence . Then maybe I should get a lawyer . Two months ago they turned around a 747 because of a security breach ... Yeah , I vanished off the plane in mid-flight . I do that from time to time . - To test airport security ? - What ? Maybe you were doing a run-through for a possible hijacking . I think it 's time that I lawyer up . Sure , here are the talking points . Why are you so interested in Dylan McCleen ? Why do you have a bill with a serial number that 's linked to the ransom money , and why did a 747 geed around in mid-flight that you were supposed to be on ? You got a warrant for my arrest ? no ? All ri where is it ? High enough so a kid can 't reach it . You think Jack would turn you in ? Well , it looks that way . - Did you call him ? - Not yet . What 's this ? Oh , her office sent it to me when they cleared out her desk . Yeah.It 's her law school diploma , personal stuff . Seemed wrong to throw it out . Maybe you can give it back to her . We got bigger problems right now , Katie . Got it . Oh , okay . So , what are you gonna do with this ? Burn it . Hello . Dan ? Yeah ? It 's Elliott Langley . dll catch you at a bad time ? No . You able to meet me at Cafe Luna in ten minutes ? I don 't have much time . Uh , sure . Sure . Who wath ? A source that 's ready to talk . I 'll be back . Yep . Heard that one before . Dr. Langley ? Hello , Dan . - Sorry , I got here as fast ... - Not a problem . How 's your book coming ? Good . an minating process . What are you doing now ? Lecturing twice a week at USF . We 're discussing quartz now . Quartz . Sand . Silicodioxide . One of the most common minerals on the planet . I see . You called me ? I did . Are figu ndin that other people are interested in your work ? As a matter of fac yes . Men with guns always want to control the men with ideas . Is that why you left hithan tk Thurn-Tippett , - was it ... ? - Yes . The Patriot Act made my research at Thurn accessible to the government . They rationalized that in a time of war , they needed access to anything that could help defeat terrorism . Defeat terrorism ? What are you working on ? Something the FBI might be interested in ? Just don 't tell anyone about your book . Even a novelist has to worry about losing intellectual property . Good night , Dan . Good night . Need some help ? We 're okay . Thanks . Before you take off the flat , you should check your spare . Okay . Well , you don 't have a spare . Damn . This car is cursed . Where you heading ? Back east to school . Maybe . Well , looks like you 're walking . This must be karma . Or maybe you just forgot the spare . I 've had a really bad month . There must be a reason for this . I 'm being taught something . What 's happened ? I had a falling out with my parents . - Oh , yeah , how ? - I 'll spare you the details . Let 's just say my mother has lousy taste in men . No tennis lessons , crockpots , or diet pills for me . Sorry ? Nothing . My life has changed its course and I 'm just gonna go with it . Well , sometimes you don 't have a choice . Yeah . What about you ? Ah , you know , I 'm just trying to get home . You 're good . Hey . Hi . Dude smells like bacon . Yeah . Where you heading ? She 's going to the closest gas station . What 's the date ? The 20th . What year ? 1973 . - ' 74 . - 1974 . I don 't think he 's a cop . We 're heading to Winterland . Neil Young 's playing . What do you think ? Kind of out there . You know what ? I think you 're better off with them . Are you gonna come ? No . I 'm headed in the opposite direction . What 's your name ? Abigail . But I like Abby . So do I. Well , uh , thanks for talking with me . Yeah . Um , see you down the road . Katie ? Katie ... ? I didn 't know Garrity was coming to see you . Get out of here , Jack . Dan , let 's let him finish . I didn 't search your house for money . Zack brought the money out ... And so you launched an investigation ? There was a bag of brand-new $ 100 bills from 30 years ago . asked our money guy about a single $ 100 bill . He took it , he entered it into the system the serial numbers tripped the Feds , okay . And once they got involved , I had to cooperate . I can 't risk lying to a federal agent . Let 's justeep this civil , okay . Zack 's sleeping . u stole money from my house and you took it to your lab to analyze . Yeah , and you 've been lying to me , Danny . Guys ... I mean if you 're in trouble , if you 're in over your head - with people you owe money to ... - I 'm not in trouble , Jack . Then tell me where the money came from . No . I 'm not an EagScout , Da I 'll give you cover if you tell me the truth . But if your lies take me down , I will cut you loose . I 've already told you the truth when I told you about Livia back then . And you did that , which means ? So , I 'm gonna tell you again . Get the hell out of my house ! Sure . Dan ... I don 't want to hear you defend him anymore . Do you understand ? I 'm sorry about last nig . I-I got too angry . I just didn 't want it to escalate , is all . I know . I gotta go . I 'm late . Good morning . I have a warrant to search the premises . Hey . Hey . Hey ! Don 't you guys leeper cells you should be worrying about ? Daring humor for a man on a no-fly list . Forgetting something ? Hold it there . I need to look in that briefcase . A briefcase is an " on-person " item . We have bags listed in warrant , so we can search it ... Not if it 's locked . You need a separate warrant ... True , but we can confiscate it . I can keep going . * * Thank you . Thank you . So , we 'll see you tonight . Yeah . I love you . * * Hey , you need an invitation ? Take a seat . All right . At 11 : 35 this morning , a letter was delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State in Washington . This is a replica of it . It read in its entirety , " I hereby resign " the Office of President of the United States . Sincerely , Richard Nixon . " There was more ... Hey . Okay , I 'm lost . Do you remember Abby from the swingers party ? I put her on a bus with them . I was saying ... each individual is complicated and has different needs . Anyone who thinks they only need one partner is cutting himself off from beautiful experiences with multi-dimensional souls . No reason we shouldn 't have multiple lovers in this world . Women aren 't chattel , Sammy . All I 'm saying is there is plenty of me to go around . Something amusing over there ? Not at all . He looks familiar . There she is . Hello , Abby . Do I know you ? We met at your folks . My name is not Abby . It 's Angela . You dropped out of school ? Apparently , yeah . How 's it going ? I 'm great . My life is great . Hey , get your feet in . People are walking here . So where you heading ? Don 't know yet . 's your bag ? You got a job ? You drop out ? I 'll take this one . Go ahead . We 're time travelers . Mo says he 's from the Middle Ages . And no joke , guess what it 's called . The High Middle Ages . Yes , the High Middle Ages . Hey , check it out . Crystals . Quartz . Quartz crystals keep time better than any other substance that we have on the planet . So what about you guys ? 2007 . Cool . Neil Young 's still playing . But , uh , Winterland 's gone . Oh . Mo , they 're full of it . Let 's split . You don 't have to go with them . You can come with us . Where ? Now , Angela . * * * * * * Hey ! Hey ! Damn it ! * * Where is he ? Jack , you shouldn 't be here . He was serious this time . He doesn 't want to talk to you . I 'm not looking for Dan . I 'm looking for Garrity . Where is he ? Probably going through my underwear right now . yo Did u call your lawyer ? No . Why not ? Because we haven 't done anything wrong . Or you just don 't want people to know what 's really going on . Jack ... Don 't worry about it . I 'm over it . Hang yourselves . Jack . You shouldn 't be here , Inspector . Yeah , I 've been getting that a lot lately . Truth is , you shouldn 't be here . Pardon me ? Whatever you find is not going to be admissible in court . Oh , really ? I didn 't take evidence off the premises legally . I didn 't have a warrant . There was a silent hit on the serial number . I 've articulated probable cause , and if we didn 't obtain any evidence illegally , it 's not going to be a problem . And you 've got to be one dumb cop if you didn 't know that . I 'mb so much as desperate . I illegally lifted evidence from this house . At the very least , I 'm going to get disciplined by IA . I wouldn 't mind calling attention to your witch hunt . Look ... I know what this is about . I know your brother ran off with your girlfriend and you drink alone a lot , so I get that . As a guy , I feel for you . And his isofour wiy shong her a thatd-ou 're stanup g , I guess we can do more dinner theatre if you want . I only got one brother . He 's messed up , but he 's not a crook . Go home , Jack . Let 's do the garage . Hi , I 'm Dan Vasser with The Register . Do you have a daughter named Abby ? Hello ? No . Thank you . I-I mean , I used to . She changed her name to Angela Harvest . That 's maybe why I 've had trouble finding her . Listen , I don 't want to talk to any more reporters . I 'm sorry , I 'm ... I was a friend of Abby 's . I 'm not doing a story . I just want to find a way to reach her . Try Sonoma Correctional . She 's in prison ? Yeah . How long has she been there ? 30 years . What did she do ? Did she kill someone ? You know , for a friend of Abby 's , you sure don 't keep in touch . Hey , how 's it going ? Well , in a nutshell , I sent a girl to prison for life . Great . Great ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't hear your answer . My query was perfunctory . Are you okay ? I found Livia . Didn 't find anything , huh ? I can 't comment on an ongoing investigation . And I do not want to talk about your brother . Why 'd you call me here then ? You filed 24 incident reports that involve currency . Not one conflict of interest . Not even a spelling error . Well , I wasn 't expecting a citation for penmanship , but thank you . There was one blip , however . One of your reports was tampered with . What ? September 1995 . A cabbie was given a counterfeit $ 20 bill . The bill in question was not counterfeit , but a leaked prototype . Okay . Cabbie described his passenger as a stocky Caucasian male with short , blonde hair . So what 's the problem ? The problem is the original bill is missing . I didn 't touch it . It 's sealed . Treasury Secretary John Snow is not appointed until 2003 . No counterfeiter could 've known that in 1995 . Thistheal ans noing . What does this have to do with my brother ? I don 't know . Did you catch and release him that day in ' 95 ? Where in that report does it say I was chasing Dan Vasser ? And what does this have to do with Dylan McCleen 's ransom ? I 'm not sure believe they are linked . I think for a federal agent you 've got way too much time on your hands . * * Thank you . Well , unfortunately , for you and your brother , that 's exactly right . I mean , I found out when she lives . Where 'd you get this ? In the Livia box in the closet . The FBI turned the place upside down . I found it on the bed . So take your finger off the button . She told me this was her aunt . Is it her aunt ? Knowing what you know now ? She lives in the past . But where ? I don 't know . I thought all you guys do is talk ? So now you 're upset that I don 't talk to her enough . I want to know where the other woman lives . Katherine . Dunston ... Good to see you . How 's your end of the year list coming ? Marvelous , a few surprises . Oh , come on . Just give us a hint . You get rid of Dan for a night and I 'll show you personally . Katie , the man 's busy . Hugh . Katie . How 's the new job ? It 's good . Thanks . What 's going on ? Nothing . Yeah , he was just helping me with a story . Oh , perhaps , a more seasoned hand , huh ? Katie , I ... Right , um , you should probably go . I 've got to run . How 's the follow-up on Candlestick Point ? I just sent it . Dan , I need to talk to you about the visitor yesterday . Can it wait ? I 've got to go to Zack . No , no . This 'll take a second . Have you actually appeared on camera yet ? I haven 't committed any journalism yet . I 'm just filling out forms , but I start next week . Katie , you 're going to give all those women a run for their money . Even in high-def . From your lips to the control room 's ears . Well , good luck . Okay , Dan ... Get your ass down on the floor ! Get on the floor now ! Hey ! How 'd he get in here ? I thought you had the door ? I don 't know . He just appeared . Hey ! Get over here . You watch these guys . You help me with the safe . Right . * * Kill the lights ! * * * * * * Don 't move . Abby ? Sam . Don 't call him , Abby . Sammy . Have you ever robbed anywhere before ?

I didn 't have a mission , or at least I didn 't know what it was back then and ... I wasn 't being sent back , so I adapted . I had to survive . Like get a job . Say what you want about Abby 's generation , but it pushed the needle a few degrs , so I did what would have been a lot harder in the 1940s . I went to law school . I sort of found myself . And then I met a guy . And I fell in love with him . And I was ready ... I was happy to spend the rest of my life with him . But something ... someone had other plans for us . And when she disappeared off the plane ? She went back home . To 1948 ? Yeah . Could that happen to you ? Will you disappear for a long time back there ? Livia says the trips will get longer . Oh , God . Katie , I love you and I do not regret my choice . Livia and I just work together like foreign correspondents on assignment . No , don 't . Stay here . Draft ? Yeah , thanks , Terrance .

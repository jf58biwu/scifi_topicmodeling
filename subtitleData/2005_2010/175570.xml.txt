But remember , we 're brother and sister . You reflect on me . A 'ight , so pay attention . I was born paying attention . Just watch out for thermal drafts . Don 't get near the wash of the vents . Got it , Barry . Like the first 50 times in the simulator . It pays for me to be remedial with you . Now , don 't get cocky dow there . - Healthy fear , I know . - It 's your funeral . Belongs to the Navy , you know . You break it , you bought it . Got it . Mystic descending , and we are at 500 feet . We are now at 2,300 feet . 3,000 feet . All right , let 's get into the intro . Ready when you are , Dee . This is Dr. Laura Daughtery on board the Mystic submersible . in the midst of a descent to the San Juan de Fuca plate . - She 's gonna do fine . - I know We 'll collect biological samples to support the theory that the hotbed ecosystem is the origin of life on the planet . - Okay , I wait at 5,000 feet . - All right , keep on that heading . It 's nice up close . Okay , bottom sighted . It 's the hot vent ecosystem . Look at that thing . It 's flourishing down here . I mean , there 's tube worms , Pompeiis , and spider crabs . Water temperature 's up to 417 . And it 's rising as we near the vents . You guys getting anything weird on radar ? Uh , negative , Mystic . We ... Wait . Check that .

Well , Mystic , we 're not seeing anything up here . So , uh , what do you say we get back to the program ? Are you seeing this ? Better ... I 'm recording this . Craters . A field of them . The depth gauge is falling off the chart . 8-8,000 ... 8,500 . Wait ... wait , something 's wrong . It 's fluctuating . It 's-it 's ... It 's-it 's , um ... Something 's coming up .

Bigger than the throw from the spots . - Giant squid ? - I saw a pectoral fin . Living fossil , like a coelacanth , Eocene whale . No coelacanth , no Eocene . This wasn 't part of any phylum or any sub grouping . Very seriously . This could be what we 've been working for . A higher mammalian species . Come on . Wait , wait , let ...

I 've been answering your questions for three hours . Did you see any brightly colored lights ? Yes . My turn . Who are you people ? Scientists , like you . You know , I know who you are . Alexander Cirko , from Berkeley . That was a long time ago . They kicked you off the faculty because you ... I found working in academia to be counterproductive . Ah , and who ys the bills now ? A mix of private and ... public concerns . - If we could continue . - No , no more . Not until you tell me what you know , and then , like scientists , we collaborate . That 's impossible , Doctor . Why is that ? Because the institute 's research programs have been suspended indefinitely . What ? The facility 's now under the jurisdiction of the U.S. armed forces . We 'll need you to sign some things before you go . I 'm not signing anything . I was the one that saw it . Alone , at 5,000 feet ! I was the one that saw it in a disabled submersible . A new vertebrate ! If I could have a word alone , please . I empathize with your position . I recognize that you had a profound experience . You have kids , Doctor ? No . I had one at 21 . You put yourself through school ? I won a series of fellowships . I worked my way through . And wanna know how ? I waited tables four nights a week to pay for tuition and daycare . We are not on the same planet . So don 't try to empathize with me . I worked my ass off to get here . And I deserve to be a part of this . Endangered species ... don 't deserve to be on the brink of extinction . But they are . You are a marine biologist . You of all people must know that life ... isn 't fair . Call Kayla . She 's a gas . She just got married , too , and I hear he 's Scottish or Irish or something . Where are all the fish ? Yes ! Yes , I 'll bring wine . Red or white ? What are you serving ? Oh ...

I hate it when you use my stuff ! What is going on in there ? ! You are disgusting , you know that ? Just a second ! I 'm gonna go get Mom . I 'm counting to three . That 's it . One ... two ... three . Mom , he 's using my hairdryer and he 's hogging the bathroom ! You 're late ! I know , I know . Sorry . But ... something happened . Something amazing . You 're late ! I didn 't teach him to do that . Dad , this is ... You 're not ... You 're not listening . This is not some sort of a setback . Okay ? This is ... I don 't even know . Or if I can get back into the institute . They 've completely confiscated all of my research , Dad . That means all . All of the dive tapes and everything . Mom , I 'm bored . Sweetie , I 'm talking to grandpa . Can you just go inside and watch TV or something ? Dad , listen , I 'm not being unreasonable , but you have to understand that ... Teach men to adapt themselves to some new world of the future . Leonard first saw the carcass while walking his dog on a pre-dawn stroll Friday morning . And since then , local and state health officials are wondering what to do ... Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! What ? ! Jesse , what , what ? There it was , just lolling in the water . It gave me quite a shock . Frankly , a whale carcass is a public health hazard . Something of this size could contaminate the water table , kick-start a red tide . We 've taken precautionary measures . Cordoned off the beach until the carcass can be dealt with . Shut down US 17 , cut down on the looky loos . We 've got to look out for the interests of the public at large , you know ? Authorities claim that the decomposed carcass is a sperm whale that died at sea and drifted to ... Dad , I 'm gonna call you back . However , some locals are less sure . So , what do you think it is ? Well , isn 't that obvious ? It 's Moby Dick . Whatever it is , whew ! It stinks . In Sullivan 's Island , South Carolina , I 'm Marilyn Prickett . You believe me , right ? I 'm ... Of course I do . I just ... I 'm trying to understand . Well , honey , I 'm trying to understand too , you know ? Shh , you 're gonna wake up the kids . Oh , screw waking up the kids , baby . Something happened to me . I know you believe that . Don 't treat me like I 'm crazy . No , no , I didn 't say you were crazy . I ... - Honey , you were knocked . - No ! I was clear as a bell ! You were unconscious when Bug found you . Hon , I don 't think you were in your right mind when ... What ? When what ? When George drowned . - George did not drown ! - Something happened ... and you were knocked ... and he drowned . - No . - That 's it . That 's all that happened . - It was an accident . - Look , you know ... I don 't know how else to put this . I 'm just asking you to believe me . I am trying . I ... I just don 't understand why you 're driving to South Carolina . So I can convince myself ... that it wasn 't my fault . Okay . Charleston , South Carolina , that 's right . As early as possible . All right , let me check the computer for you , ma 'am . Um , do you have anything tonight ? Um , let me see here . We do have one . It 's a connecting flight for one passenger . Is that all right ? Um , you better make that two tickets . All right . Ladies and gentlemen , there is some evidence that this is simply a natural phenomenon . This was recovered near the sighting in South Carolina . The tooth has no known antecedent in the fossil record . It is as if it just fell from the sky .

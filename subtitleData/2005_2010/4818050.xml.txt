 102.6 ) } FIT-IN BREAK All right ! Here we go ! What are you doing ? Is that a new sort of feint ? Shut up ! They look like they 're having fun . the streets are open as before . don 't we ? Ah ... Never mind . Sela ! Okay ! Nice pass ! right ? Maybe she finally cleared up the thing with her dad . To me it looks like she just enjoys being with Navi . then you can fall in love with them . The worst are the jerks you have zero interest in . Are you talking about yourself and James ? I was young then too ... You want to hear ? maybe I 'll tell the story then . right ? we went to see the terminator line . isn 't that ... isn 't it ? Exactly . it 's a serious crime to cross the border and visit the far side . It gets you almost a life sentence behind bars . somehow I got lost . looking for everyone . I 'd trespassed into the moon 's far side . Big footprints ... A giant ! A giant ? I was a babe in the woods . Mooneyes has always kept the giants a secret . That 's why they slapped us back down here . We did you a disservice . never mind that . What I saw on the moon 's far side was probably traces of a giant like Navi . I 'd have been arrested . so they let me be . and they 'd never believe me . It made me so angry I could cry . Those footprints were all I could think about . a shoe designer . It was around then that I first met James . He was the first person to ever listen to me talk about those footprints without laughing . And that 's how he scored a first date . What ? Did I say something funny ? don 't you ? Don 't be an idiot ! It 's over between us ! Whatever you say . Dan ! Stop ! Miyuki ? What 's wrong ? Dangan ! Gramps ... Miyuki ? Where 's it broken ? It 's the driver system in the foot . Can you fix it ? anyway . But ... But " ? some other part will just wear out next time . Just simple repair isn 't gonna cut it . What do you mean ? Your skills as operators are starting to surpass these mechs ' abilities . and the Dangan ... They 're all in the same condition to one degree or another . And take a look here . That looks tasty ! No eating ! That 's the reactor that powers a Bigfoot . Their power source is ultinium . but their output has been increasing little by little lately . What 's the deal ? right ? A runaway reactor is a lit stick of dynamite ! worse than that . You can 't leave something lying around with no idea when it 's gonna blow up . you really are smart . Dan . How are you going to deal with this ? A full overhaul and upgrade so they can keep up with how everyone plays . But there 's a problem . A problem ? We can 't do it with the facilities available here . Miyuki . we need specialized data from one other ultinium power system . you mean that place } Miyuki ? Where 's there ? Area Zero . Sacred ground for Bigfoots ... It 's the place where my father died . Your Majesty . Concert preparations are proceeding on schedule . then the stones will speak again ? Your Majesty . Truly ? I swear by the thunderbolt 's power and the gods of Earth . Yan Harris . The wind is weeping . A voice of never-healing sadness . considering it was left to rot all those years . The system looks like it 's still humming along . Access request : Takeshi Ayukawa . File ID M1152 . Ultinium Critical-Region Response Regulation and Inquiries into Practical Application for Bigfoot Power Systems . Executing request . This is ... The research data your father left behind . Yan . you two . could you take it to your new manager ? I 'm — Did we really make the right decision ? We decided to do the concert without mentioning it to Rouge ... We wonder if maybe she would be against it ... Violette . Rouge will abide by the decision you two have made . after all . We do it all for the sake of the new legend . On second look ... Wear like this couldn 't be caused just by swinging the stick around . Amazing . do you ? So what 'll you do ? What ? By herself ? ! old man ? Buzz off . Ask Miyuki . Miyuki ? Do you even know how many days it 'll take you to do it alone ? not sit around ! And we gotta go to the moon — Shut up ! You go take a nap and dream about that idol or something ! Wha — ! Dumbass ... Who 'd ... your face is as red as can be . Please ! give me free rein ! Y-You don 't have to ask ! okay ? I 'm leaving . Mr. Dan ! Don 't call me Mr. Dan ! okay ? I 'm so hungry ... pretty boy . Something good 'll happen sooner or later . Ganz Bogard ! Bel Lindon ! What is it ? Who 's that ? Is that ... Princess Aurora ? The princess ? ! you haven 't eaten yet ? Leave it over there . I 'll eat it later . Miss Miyuki ... Is Miyuki coming ? but she 's pushing herself too hard . Suddenly saying that she wants to do the work by herself ... and it doesn 't look like she sleeps much . She 'll wreck her health if she goes on like this . please . Right now Miyuki is trying to raise her level as an engineer . she has to improve her skills as well . That 's what that child decided . Dan ! and you 'll collapse of exhaustion . A-Alan and the rest are worried about you . You took a bite of this . right ? Yeah . But I want to get these babies fixed as quick as I can . I want to take the data my Dad left behind and have it serve everyone . I worked at Lunatic doing research on ultinium . The reactor that powers Bigfoots now is a system I developed then . My son Takeshi was trying to develop that system even further . or what ? Takeshi was trying to use machines to recreate the giants of legend . and leaves deep scars . Dad ! intellectually . New technologies bring with them new accidents . I understood that . people must be fools . I wonder why Miss Miyuki wanted to follow in her father 's footsteps after he passed away . I sort of get why she would do that . She must have wanted to feel something of her father through her work . Feel her father ... Gramps created Bigfoots as labor-saving devices to improve quality of life . He 's always taught me that the work of an engineer is to look at what I can do to make Bigfoots bring people happiness . me and Gramps both doubted ourselves . right ? Technology is just like sake ! someday it 'll destroy you ! What 's that ? An impression of your grandpa ? Basically it means that the pursuit of technology itself becomes your goal . I don 't understand this confusing stuff . But I don 't hate Bigfoots any more . and we 'd never have started playing Basquash . right ? They only could because of Bigfoots . though I 'll die before I say so . Dan ... Eat your grub . Spanky . Huh ? Grub ? I wanna eat something good ... Bel 's share is left over . He 's asleep . That 's okay . O earth ... Carry a song of peace to the souls that were lost . Sela ! Practicing by yourself ? It doesn 't count as practice ... I just have nothing to do . Then ... I don 't mind keeping you company . Don 't get the wrong idea ! that 's all . { alt tl : I don 't have anything to do either . } But ... It certainly doesn 't mean that I want to play Basquash with you or anything . What 's so funny ? ! How are you going to practice without a Bigfoot ? You 're a big silly . you could just say so . Crawly ! It 's not that funny ! Sorry ... Catch me caring ! just don 't be mad ! good ! Miyuki won 't beat me ! This is a chance to perfect my Super-Sole Pattern and all-weather tracing system ! There 's so much to do ! is something the matter ? You look a bit downhearted . do you think I can go on like this ? What do you mean ? they all have a clear answer . But me ... What do I think I 'm doing ? Princess ... can I ? Taking a break ? { oh sound } Gramps ! You 're just in time . Look at this . in Dad 's charts . A bunch of parts they ought to show are missing . You 're right . I never noticed . And the energy regulator is directly coupled to the core . What a sneaky bastard ! You knew ? It 's something my son would do . What ? What ? Weren 't you gonna do this on your own ? I guess I can favor my adorable granddaughter with a hint . but it 's also to keep your own self from forgetting . Takeshi didn 't draw those parts on the chart because he had no fear of forgetting them . I get it ! isn 't it ? The speed of light ? Pi ? so ... The energy conversion efficiency ? The coefficient of friction ? ! so it must be a three-vector matrix ! what doesn 't change ... A constant tensile strength ... a constant base value ! Valley one ! except maybe they 're pretending to be invading generals or something . } My surprise attack has failed . Princess ... Look ! These are my masterpieces ! But they look exactly the same . The insides ! Insides ! the insides are completely different ! do it after you 've tried them out ! but this is totally the same ... How 's it different ? This ... Amazing ! Well ? Noticed the difference ? Yes . There 's no unnecessary motion . with no jerkiness at all . the difference is night and day . Light ... That 's good work . You 've grown up . I bet Takeshi is happy right about now . Gramps ... Awesome ! I 've never seen Bigfoots like these before ! The kinesthetics are completely different ! It 's like my nerves run all the way to her fingertips ! Miss Miyuki ! Miyuki ! So — She 's tired . Let 's let her sleep . Working too hard . All right ! These 'll take us straight to Mooneyes ! Just you wait ! What is this ? These are memories . Things I remember . Who am I ? I 'm Rouge . I know those people . Citron . Violette . Friends I value very much . Rouge ! Dan ! No ! No ! Stop ! No ! Rouge . I 'm ... Rouge . How does it feel to be reborn ? Feel ? I don 't know . Hey ... Why am I crying ? Don 't worry about it . You must have dreamed of something sad . That happens all the time . Contact General Manager Yan Harris . Let him know that Rouge 's preparations are complete . ma 'am . A sad dream ... ? Gramps said I did good . He said I 'm grown up . right ? All your children . One day they 'll go to the moon too . 487 ) \ frx0 \ fry16 } NEXT TIME 438 ) } NEXT TIME 487 ) } TOTAL ECLIPSE 396 ) } TOTAL ECLIPSE come quick !

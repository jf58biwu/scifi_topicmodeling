Strange things can happen when you 're away from the fleet . I wouldn 't even trust your own memories on this .

Cylon technology is gonna keep this fleet moving ' , - Mr. Gaeta . - I need to speak to the Admiral . Why would that be ? Because you 're a Cylon , sir . There 's a meeting later today to discuss some new idea of Mr. Tyrol 's . You can let the Admiral in on your views there . Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . I don 't understand . Why would you set up a meeting with him ? - I shouldn 't have said it . Forget it . - What are you doing ? Look . You found me and you saved me , so I 'll protect you . But if this doesn 't work out , and if I 'm wrong ... You have a bright future , Louis . What are you talking about ? If what doesn 't work ? Keep your head down . What are you going to do ?

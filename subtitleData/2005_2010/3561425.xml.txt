EVEN AS MEDICS , WE 'RE- - WE 'RE SOLDIERS FIRST . YOU UNDERSTAND ? YES , OF URSE . I CALLED ARTILLERY , GAVE THEM M THE COORDINATES . AND WITHIN MINUTES , THE SCHOOL WAS SHELLED . IT WAS ON FIRE . THE ROOF CAVED IN . AND WE ADVANCED . TO THE SCHOOL ? TO THE SCHOOL . I HEARD CRYING COMING FROM ININSIDE , SO I CRAWLED UNDER THE RUBBLE . AND ITIT WAS A SCHOOL . ITAS JUST A SCHOOL . NOTHING BUT CHILDREN . THAT 'S WHEN I SAW HER ... REACHING OUT TO ME . SHE WAS CALLING FOR ME . ANOTHER SHELL EXPLODED ON TOP OF US BEFORE I COULD GET TO HER . THAT 'S THE SCAR ONOUR BACK ? AND THAT 'S WHO YOU SAW ON THE TAB--THE SCHOOLGIRRL . I 'M A DOCTOR . I 'M A PSYCHIATRIST . WHATEVER THIS WAS , IT W WASN 'T PAINEDICATION OR WITHDRAWAL FROM ALCOHOL . THIS WAS ... A FULL-BLOWN HALLUCINATION . ( beeps , door whooshes ) DID YOU GET IT ALL ? I THINK MOST OF IT . I 'M , UH ... I 'M SO SORRY . I PUT ALL YOU GUYS THROUGH THIS . PAULA ... PAULA AND I- - ( sighs ) YOU NEED TO STOP BLAMING YOURSELF . I WAS THE ONE MOVING TOO FAST . SHE WASN 'T READY TO CATCH IT . DID YOU MAKE THE HATCH DOOR CLOSE ? THAT 'S NOT THE POINT . THE POINT IS I CAN B A COMPLETE IDIOT . YES , YOU CAN . OVER AND OVER , R , I ASK MYSELF WY THEY CHOSE YOU FOR THIS CREW . YOU 'RE CLUMSY , YOU EAT TOO MUCH , AND YOU BEHAVE LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY . SEE ? BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ? WHAT ? EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE , YOU FIND A THUMB . ( woman speaking indistinctly over P.A. ) YOU HAD AN EMERGENCY HYSTERECTOMY , ZOE . I 'M SORRY . AM I OUT OF THE PROGRAM ? NO . YOU HAD AN OVARIAN CYST . IT BURST . OUR SCANS DIDN 'T DETECT IT . A BURST CYST ? THAT 'S WHAT WE 'RE SAYING . UNDERSTAND ? ( whispers ) YES . THANK YOU . YOU COULD HAVE COME TO ME , ZOE . I WOULD VE BEEN ABLE TO DO SOMETHING . WE NEVER REMEMBER THE ONES WE SAVE , AND WE NEVER FORGET THE ONES WE FAIL . ( The Cinematic Orchestra 's " That Home " playing ) IT 'S ABOUT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR CHOICES ... ABOUT LEARNING FROM SACRIFICE . Â¶ WHERE THE DOORS ARE MORNING ALALL DAY LONG Â¶ Â¶ WHERE THE SIRS ARE LEANING DUSK TO DAWN Â¶ IT 'S THOSE HARD LESSONS THAT SHAPE US AND HOW WE RESPOND , WHERE WE GO IN OUR LIVES . Â¶ WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE BREATHING IN THE LIGHT Â¶ Â¶ WHERE THE ROOMS ARE A COLLECTION OF OUR LIVES Â¶ THIS IS A PLACE WHERE I GO Â¶ I DON 'T THINK THERE 'S EVER BEEN A MAN OR A WOMAN WITHOUT SOME KIND OF REGRET . AND THAT 'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING ... Â¶ THIS IS A PLACE Â¶ BECAUSE IT 'S OUR FAILURES , MORE THAN OUR SUCCESSES , THAT MAKE US WHO WE ARE .

NOTHING BUT CHILDREN . THAT 'S WHEN I SAW HER ... REACHING OUT TO ME . SHE WAS CALLING FOR ME . ANOTHER SHELL EXPLODED ON TOP OF US BEFORE I COULD GET TO HER . THAT 'S THE SCAR ONOUR BACK ? AND THAT 'S WHO YOU SAW ON THE TAB--THE SCHOOLGIRRL . I 'M A DOCTOR . I 'M A PSYCHIATRIST . WHATEVER THIS WAS , IT W WASN 'T PAINEDICATION OR WITHDRAWAL FROM ALCOHOL . THIS WAS ...

( The Cinematic Orchestra 's " That Home " playing ) IT 'S ABOUT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR CHOICES ... ABOUT LEARNING FROM SACRIFICE . ¶ WHERE THE DOORS ARE MORNING ALALL DAY LONG ¶ ¶ WHERE THE SIRS ARE LEANING DUSK TO DAWN ¶ IT 'S THOSE HARD LESSONS THAT SHAPE US AND HOW WE RESPOND , WHERE WE GO IN OUR LIVES . ¶ WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE BREATHING IN THE LIGHT ¶ ¶ WHERE THE ROOMS ARE A COLLECTION OF OUR LIVES ¶ THIS IS A PLACE WHERE I GO ¶ I DON 'T THINK THERE 'S EVER BEEN A MAN OR A WOMAN WITHOUT SOME KIND OF REGRET . AND THAT 'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING ... ¶ THIS IS A PLACE ¶ BECAUSE IT 'S OUR FAILURES , MORE THAN OUR SUCCESSES , THAT MAKE US WHO WE ARE .

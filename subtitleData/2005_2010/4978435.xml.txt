 Torchwood . Outside the Government , beyond the Police . Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future . The 21st century is when everything changes , and you 've got to be ready . Nearly there . We 've been right busy since you lot were billeted here . This your first time ? The others been teasing you , is that it ? My name 's Mary . Mary , like the virgin . Religious man , are ya ? I 'm not your bloody hound . Whore ! Do whores have prayers ? Once , just once , I 'd like to walk into one of these tents and find it 's a party . You know , food , drink , people dancing , girl crying in the corner . Is it alien ? And how . I 'm picking up traces of ilmenite , pyroxene , and even Dark Matter . Any idea what it is ? Not a clue . Could be a weapon , or a really big stapler . How 's our friend there ? She 's dead . Yeah , thanks , Quincy She ? Judging by the size of her skull . How long have they been here , Tosh ? From the depth they found them ... 196 years , 11 to 11.5 months . The earth 's been disturbed so I 'm afraid I can 't be more accurate . What killed her ? The stapler ? Nah . See those shattered ribs ? I reckon she was shot . Well , let 's get her back to the Hub and find out . You 're so light ! You 're like a girl . I 'm not light , I 'm wiry . Fat girls go mad for it . But I guess I don 't need to tell you that . I 'm really sorry , I think your computer might be dead . You 're kidding . What happened ? OK , so she said I was no good at sport ... Hello ? ! So I said , " Throw something to me and ... " What happened to the computer ? Oh . I kicked out the plug . What ? It was running a translation programme I 'd written . I 'd collated every scrap of alien language we 've got , and broken it down into binary threads to see if there was a common derivation . That 's a bit of a mouthful . Sorry . Private joke . Um , stupid joke . We 're supposed to be professionals . We 've got a job to do . She 's right . You 're right , Tosh , I 'm sorry . Do you know what , Tosh ? Sometimes I think even that stick up your arse has got a stick up its arse . The guy over there 's been staring at me all evening , and I told him he 's wasting his time but he won 't listen , so I 've come over to talk to you because I know how this ends - he gets a punch in the neck and I get barred , and I 've already been barred from about 20 pubs . And I don 't want to get barred from this one because they do these nice olives on the tables . Right . OK , then . Cool . Let me get you a drink . Really , there 's no need . JD and Coke , and ... Toshiko , what do you want ? I didn 't tell you my name . Oh , yeah . That was the other thing . I kind of know who you are . I think you 're mistaken . Toshiko Sato . Born in London , 1975 , moved to Osaka when you were two , then back to the UK in 1986 . Parents in the RAF , grandfather worked at Bletchley Park . Very impressive . University ... blah-blah , snapped up to Government science think tank when you were 20 , recruited to Torchwood three years ago . I saw you at the building site this morning . What was that you had in the case ? How do you know about Torchwood ? There 's stuff on the internet , but you have to dig really deep . Plus , we pick bits and pieces up from police radio scanners , we also ... We ? Scavengers . Collectors . Just like you . How many of there are you ? Oh , listen , don 't think it 's in any way organised . It 's really just a disparate bunch of IT guys who live with their mothers . I shouldn 't talk to you . So go . What 's most amazing are the similarities with our own culture . But that can be horrible , because we find lots of weapons , and it just makes you think , " My God , everything wages war . " It 's not just a trait of ours , but a trait of existence . It makes you feel so hopeless . But then there are times ... We found this thing , it was about A4 size , and it had all these symbols on it . And it took me about three months to translate , and it was a letter someone had written to his family , to his children , to say how much he was missing them . And it just made me cry , because I thought , even across these unimaginable distances , there are fundamentals that stay exactly the same . And there 's no-one to talk to about this . I mean , the guys at work , they 're great , but they don 't ... see it the way I do . I could be fired ... just for telling you that . I want to show you something . It 's a pendant . Put it on . I 'll drink one more , then just drive slowly . Does coffee count as food if you take sugar ? If he tugs his groin one more time , I 'll smack him in the face ... I should have said it was Hammer Time when she asked what the time was . That would have made them laugh . What are they ? I can hear voices . Bloody Sudoku ... Did I send that email ? Did I click " reply to all " ? They 're people 's thoughts . He doesn 't touch me any more . They 're people 's thoughts , Toshiko . 'I wish I 'd shagged that single dad I met . ' 'What 's that Asian girl doing - having a fit or something ? ' It 's ... They 're so loud . 'She 's cute , though . Is that her girlfriend ? 'Marcus reckons he 's done it with two lesbians , lucky sod . 'How would it work ? ' That man over there with ... I can hear him . OK , Toshiko , I need you to focus . I can hear all of them . 'Home in on my voice . Shut everything else out . ' It 's so ... ' Just me . There 's no-one else but me . Can you hear me ? 'Can you hear me now ? 'OK , I want you to home in on just MY thoughts . 'Ignore everything else . There 's just so much ... ' 'You can do it . It takes practice , but this is what you have to learn . 'Now , what am I thinking ? 'This is so hard ... 'Follow my voice . What am I thinking ? 'You 're thinking ... That I want to kiss you ... ' I 'm sorry , that was ... No , look , it 's ... Sometimes you can 't control ... I know , it 's fine . Where did you get it ? It 's been in the family a long time . I 've never seen anything like it . It 's incredible . It 's more than incredible . With this , you can read people 's minds . It levels the pitch between man and God . Is it alien ? I guess . No , I want you to keep it . What ? I can 't , Mary . Please . I 've kept it too long . After a while , it gets ... You hear too much . It changes how you ... see people . I 'll have to show it to the others . What ? Nothing . Just , I bet you don 't . And you know this from finding my CV on the internet ? No , because I know the pendant . Well , you 're wrong . Because I will . Yeah . But you won 't . Good morning . Yeah , hi ... Ianto . 'What the hell would produce such a perfect circular puncture ? 'Maybe some kind of wooden stake . Hey , Tosh . 'She 'd better not go into one about the computer again . ' Morning . 'Sergeant giving it all , " Oh , Gwennie has deigned to call her old mates . " 'Should put a weevil in his bathroom . ' I 've got something to show you . Sure . ' Please don 't make us sit through another slideshow about the Incas or whatever it was . 'I want a biscuit . ' Have I got time for a pee first ? ' Oh , the jeans in the boots thing has really kind of had its day . ' I ... I found this thing ... ' What 's she talking about ? She can be dead weird . 'Wonder what she 'd be like in bed . Catholic but grateful , I bet . ' OK . Um , I don 't know if this comes under actual technology . 'I can smell Owen on me from that shag in his car this morning . 'That 's twice now - does that make it an arrangement ? Has to be more than two times surely ... 'Long as we keep it to just the two times we 're fine . What 's Tosh looking at ? ' You OK , Tosh ? 'When she ran her tongue across my teeth ... 'I should have worn different trousers - I 'm gonna have to sit down till this subsides a bit . ' Yeah . No . Fine . So what is it you wanted to show us ? 'I wonder if I could get Owen to come down to the vault . No , couldn 't have sex in front of a weevil . 'I couldn 't even do it in front of Trevor Kendall 's cat . ' Forget it . It 's ... I found this article ... I 'll bring it in tomorrow . No worries . ' But thanks for that rambling trip to nowhere , Tosh . ' 'Can 't imagine the time when this isn 't everything . 'Pain so constant , like my stomach 's full of rats . 'Feels like this is all I am now . 'There isn 't an inch of me that doesn 't hurt . ' I 'm about to brew some of Jack 's industrial strength coffee . Would you like a cup ? I 'm ... I 'm fine . Thanks , Ianto . Might have known you 'd have my address as well . Did you tell them ? No . I didn 't . What made you change your mind ? You listened to them , didn 't you ? See , I told you ! Isn 't it incredible ? Some of the stuff you hear ... What is this thing ? Why did you give it to me ? I told you . The things I heard . What they thought of me , what they really thought . God , these are people that are supposed to like me ! They do like you . People are complicated , they ... OK , I should have warned you about this . It isn 't like reading someone 's diary . The stuff you 've been hearing , it 's so deep , so personal - stuff they 're not even aware they 're thinking . You think you know someone , then suddenly you see them for real , and they 're ... bastard little kids . Not everything . Not everyone . I wouldn 't say your thoughts were exactly pure . At least they 're consistent . No agenda . No resentment . They pity me . You don 't pity me . Why would I ? What you 're thinking now , that 's pretty graphic . That wasn 't my thought . What ? I wasn 't thinking anything , that wasn 't my thought . It must have been yours . That one ! There ! That 's yours . Yeah , that was mine . I , um , certainly seem to be enjoying myself . You would . You will . You have no ashtrays in your whole house , not one . What are you using ? I think it 's an egg cup . You OK ? Freaking out a little ? Your birthday 's July , right ? You 're the expert . Isn 't it a little late to still have your cards up ? What ? " Lots of love , Owen . " I 'm guessing that 's Owen from work . Owen from the building site yesterday morning . Owen from the photo on your fridge . Put that down . All I 'm saying is , I don 't want to get in the way of anything . There 's nothing to get in the way of . I see . You want to talk about it ? Not really . It 's OK . Wouldn 't be the first time I 'd been a rebound shag . You weren 't , OK ? Nothing 's happened , nothing will ever happen . Just one of the delightful things I found out , thanks to your bloody pendant . It 's not all bad , the pendant . Some of the things it can do are extraordinary . What good could ever come of that ? You need to work that out for yourself . You need to go somewhere public , somewhere crowded . What am I looking for ? It will find you . I 'm sick of these riddles . What 's going on ? Where did you get this ? I told you . Who are you , Mary ? Is that even your real name ? OK . Here 's another name . Philoctetes . I 'm Philoctetes . 'Bandage my hand , say I shut it in the car door , that 'll explain why the signatures don 't match . ' 'Gives me an hour before Lisa gets back to dress up . 'I 've got to be careful . 'She 's started to notice her tights are baggy at the crotch . ' 'All giggly , and I 'm sat there with my boobs like something out of the National Geographic . 'Six cigarettes today , and all of them post-coital glorious . 'Ah , Mr Bond , I 've been expecting you . 'Some people should be prohibited from wearing a thong . 'What 's that girl looking at ? 'I 'm gonna kill them . 'I 'm gonna kill them . I 'm gonna kill them . 'Lay their bodies out afterwards , and lie next to them . 'I 'll have to do myself lying down . I should have practised that . ' Sorry . 'I 'll wear my glasses cos it makes me look more sensitive . ' 'If Lawrence come in and finds us , he 'll know it 's right , and what he 's been doing is trespassing . ' 'I won 't miss anything . 'I won 't miss this city , miss this body , I won 't miss anything . ' All right , Danny ? I want him back at six . And I mean six this time . Kelly 's given me 90 minutes after-hours at the tanning salon as a wedding present . Besides , you 're breaking the law bringing him home late . My dad reckons I could have you arrested , so think on . Hey . Get your shoes on and go to the toilet . What 's that face ? I don 't wanna go . Well , you have to . Lawrence will be here in a minute , and we 're looking at napkins . It 's boring . Well , take your Space Invaders . Lawrence bought him that . Don 't hear a peep out of him now . Mind , that 's Lawrence all over - dead thoughtful . Not like some . Oh , and no cola . I don 't want him coming home all excited . Thought you 'd stopped going fishing . I have . Oh , my God , Neil , what are you doing ? ! I was thinking of the Isle of Wight . Do you remember ? We had that chalet ... around when Danny was walking , and the chalet was just full of spiders and you called me your hero , because I wasn 't scared - I 'd just pick them up and throw them out . Oh , my God , Neil ! No , you 're scaring me ! And it was this perfect little memory . We were happy because we were together . And all this nonsense with Lawrence , it 's fine , I forgive you . Because I 'm looking at the bigger picture now . Oh , my God ! Oh , Christ ! Oh , no , don 't ! Please ! It 's OK , it 's just like falling asleep . Really . Don 't do this , to Danny , please ! And then we will be together forever . It 's OK . You 're OK now . Plodders . ♪ The leg bone 's connected to the hip bone ... ♪ Please stop singing . Anything to stop you singing ! I don 't know what you 're laughing at ! Stop singing , please don 't sing , please don 't sing . What 's going on ? You know the skeleton we found at the site ? Well , Amanda Burton here has just completed the post-mortem . OK , I can explain . As you may remember , at the building site , Owen said this was a woman killed by a single gunshot . I 'd been there , like , a minute ? Since then he 's had to tweak some of his initial conclusions . The first being that this isn 't , in fact , a woman , but a man . A young man . A very girly man . But still ultimately a man . Then there was the cause of death . Owen said GSW . Uh-UHH ! The correct answer was ... Unidentified trauma . But ... Unidentified trauma ? You see it in RTAs , when something like a steering column or a post goes into a body at great velocity . But the one thing that could be ruled out was ... Gunshot wound . Gunshot wound . Was there , in fact , any part of your prognosis that was right ? I got that it was a ... skeleton . Yes , you did . You 've just passed the point of ... Where did you train ? Where did you train ? DID you train ? Jack , um , do you know anything about Greek mythology ? Security visa 45895 . Harkness . A little , why ? You ever heard of Philoctetes ? It came up in a pub quiz . You went to a pub quiz ? Yeah . No , I love pub quizzes . Down at the Prince of ... Tides . Philoctetes was an archer recruited to fight in the Trojan War . He got into an argument and was marooned on the island of Lemnos for about ten years . Just left there ? Hey ! What 's happening with that list for UNIT ? Hmm ? Oh , yeah . I 'm still working on it . Right . Well , you know , when you 're ready ... Prime Minister , is this a secure line ? Can you tell me why Torchwood operations have become part of your security briefings to the leader of the Opposition ? This is incredible . This is THE most incredible thing I ever heard . They should make an action figure of you . You were right , about the pendant . I see it now - it can be used for good . What did they say at work ? How did you explain it ? I didn 't tell them . I think that 's wise . I 'm sorry , but I 'm gonna have to kiss you now . Mary , no . Listen ! You do something unbelievably brave and sexy , I have to kiss you . I don 't make the rules . So ... What 's happening with the thing you found on the building site ? Don 't know , my boss is dealing with that . I thought you did all the technological stuff . I do , but sometimes our jobs overlap a bit . I 'm doing ... There 's an admin thing he 's asked me to do . Don 't you have a secretary for that ? It 's actually quite complicated . So , what 's he found out ? I don 't know . He 's not said anything . That 's kind of strange . It isn 't , it 's fine . No , sure . I mean , if he 's keeping stuff from you , there 's bound to be a reason . You 're not still worrying about that , are you ? OK , so I 'm thinking if it isn 't a gunshot or a musket shot , or whatever they had then , maybe it was some kind of ritual . You are gorgeous ! I start looking into devil-worship and stuff from that era , see if there 's anything about plucking out hearts , and would you believe it ? There 's nothing . They ate eyeballs , they drank blood , they had sex with animals , but they did not pluck out each other 's hearts . Cos obviously that would have been weird Why are you so bothered ? Whoever did this is hardly a threat to society any more . Yeah , I know . It 's just , there 's something ... Does that remind you of anything ? Um .. That bit in Alien where that thing bursts out of John Hurt ? I 'm sorry - I should have been more specific . Does that remind you of anything helpful ? No . Sorry . Right . Erm , just go over there , do your computer stuff and think about shoes , eh ? Thank you . Has Jack said anything to you about the hardware we found with the skeleton ? No , why ? 'Check there were any hospitals nearby . 'Could have been someone died in an operation . This has sugar in it . ' No worries . Just asking . Hello . ' Keep looking at the skeleton , don 't look at her . ' 'You 're grinning ... ' Hey , Tosh . That coffee going begging ? ' What 's the matter ? Why isn 't he looking at me ? ' There 's copies of that Michael Hamilton statement on your desk . He 's still seeing Cybermen outside his mother 's house . 'Don 't think about her palm on the bottom of my spine , her hand in my hair . ' I think I 'll just go over there . OK . I 'll phone Social Services , see if there 's a history of mental illness . ' No , Gwen , this is good . 'It can 't go on . This is a good thing . Why the hell isn 't he looking at me ? ' I think my desk is on fire . So I 've just come from a really interesting conversation with a Detective Inspector Henderson . Right . Interesting because , firstly , the man had the biggest hands I 've ever seen , and secondly ... because of the story he told me about you saving a woman and her kid from being murdered by her ex-husband . Yeah , no , I was going to tell you about that . So why didn 't you ? I don 't know , it wasn 't a work thing , just a ... thing thing . Stuff happens all the time that 's not pertinent to here . You do this all the time ? So you secretly fight crime , is that it , Tosh ? I didn 't want it to look like I was showing off . The guy they arrested , Henderson , said you heard him muttering to himself as he was walking along , and that 's what tipped you off . Mm . I couldn 't really work out what he was saying at first , and then it was like , " Jesus ! " That 's weird because when I 'm about to murder someone , I 'm careful not to talk to myself about it while I 'm in the street . No , sure . I mean , that 's lesson one . I was wondering how you were getting on with this . It 's ongoing . Are you going to dismantle it ? Like I said , it 's ongoing . What ? Have I got something on my face ? Is it food ? No . Sorry . I zoned out . Well , listen , that was a good save , Tosh . Well done . OK , so I 've got crisps , I 've got coffee - real coffee - wine ... I 'm giving them the pendant . Right , let 's ... You 're right , it 's not like reading someone 's diary . It 's so much worse , and it makes me feel dirty and ashamed ... And now , I 've been spying on my friends . Some friends . What 's that supposed to mean ? They pity you , they exclude you ! They 've got you doing bloody admin ! So ? No . I 've made up my mind . Toshiko , don 't do this . So they 'll probably want to talk to you - why do you care ? It 's the pendant they 're interested in , they don 't care about you . I go in that place , I won 't come out again . What are you talking about ? They 're not the Stasi . Look , I 'll get my boss to come here . Put the phone down . OK . I 'll show you . This is why you can 't tell them . You 're cold . Who are you ? Still the person you kissed . The person you caressed . Say something . So ... I 'm shagging a woman and an alien . Which is worse ? Well , I know which one my parents would say . I read your thoughts . I didn 't see this . What else are you keeping from me ? You think there could be anything bigger than this ? The freedom you have . When I first got here , I found it almost obscene . My world was savage . Enforced worship in temples the size of cities , execution squads roaming the streets . Dissent of any kind meant death ... or transportation , to what they 'd call a feral outpost . And the pendant ? It 's how my people communicate . It 's how we 've communicated for centuries . Speaking orally , using a pre-arranged and finite number of words , it 's so archaic . And kind of gross to look at . The machine you found is a transporter . It brought me here , it can get me home again . I need it back before you dismantle it . But won 't you be in danger ? 200 years have passed . There 'll be a new government . There 'll have been 20 new governments by now . Then why hasn 't someone come back for you ? I 've been forgotten . Like Philoctetes on Lemnos . Let me take you to Torchwood . Maybe we can help you , fix the transporter , get you back home . You won 't ! You 'll examine me , assess whether or not I 'm useful , whether I 'm a danger , then lock me in a cell . You 're not interested in understanding alien cultures . It 's just as well you haven 't got the technology to reach other planets yet . Yours is a culture of invasion . Do you really think I 'm going to walk , hands raised in surrender , into that ? 'Silence when the door opens . Can 't do another night of the silence ... ' 'His hands were cold . 'Giving it all , " We 'll call Social Services , " over a few bruises ? ! ' 'The whole inheritance is going on sheltered accommodation ... 'Calling it Grandad 's little secret ... ' 'I can 't stand it any more . 'The weight of it . The depravity . ' The fear ... It fills me up . It 's in my mouth , and my hair , and my eyes . Marmer ... Like I 'm drowning in ink . What am I doing ... ? " Heart removed . " Records and post-mortem passed to Operation Lowry . " Operation Lowry ... And even when I don 't have the pendant on , even when there 's nothing , I can 't forget the things I 've seen , the things I 've heard . Heart removed . Heart removed . Removed ... How far back does it go ? It 's like a curse , something the gods send to drive someone mad . I had hope . I 'd see something , some little random act of kindness , and it made me think we were safe , there was some essential good in us . This is impossible . But there isn 't . It 's like one of the weevils . You look inside , and there 's just this great yawning scream . This is completely impossible . You were right . Everything you said about us . We 're frightened and we 're callous . Owen . You need to see this . And I can 't be part of it any longer . I don 't know what to do . Tell me what to do ! Get me into Torchwood . " In Xanadu , did Kublai Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree ... " Where Alph the sacred river ran through caverns measureless to man , " down to a sunless sea . " So , where is it , lover ? Stay here . Jack , my boss , has got it . Be quick . I 've a long journey ahead of me . I might need something to eat before I go . This what you 're looking for ? Jack ! Friend of mine - let 's call him Vincent . That was his name , after all . Regular guy , girlfriend , likes his sport , likes a beer . He starts acting a little ... strange , a little distracted . Suddenly he disappears for a couple of months . He comes back , and we 've gotta start calling him Vanessa . Since then I 've always been a little nervous when a friend behaves out of character . I 'm sorry , we haven 't been introduced . Jack Harkness . My guess is you 're not from around these parts . Now this ... This is incredible . You know what it is ? It 's a transporter . Mary was a political prisoner - she was exiled here . Look , Jack ... You 've got half of it right . Mary ... It is Mary , isn 't it ? You want to tell her the really interesting bit ? No ? Chatty , isn 't she ? I don 't know how you got a word in edgeways , Tosh . It 's a two-man transporter . Or whatever you people may be . You might be squids , for all I know . A two-squid transporter . Room for one prisoner and one guard . You want to tell us what happened to the guard , Mary ? I killed him . But I was disturbed . Then another came - a soldier . He tried to shoot me . Do whores have prayers ? So I plunged my new human hand into his chest and plucked out his heart . And that 's what you 've been doing ever since . This form needs to be fed . All the punctures were all about the size of a fist . My God , all those people . You killed all those people . I fled before any more soldiers came . I had so much to explore ! And how I loved this body . So soft . So wicked . The power such a body has in this world . Within a few years the forest had gone , transporter was safely buried under the spread of the city . I didn 't care , I wasn 't exactly in a hurry to get home . And you 've been killing ever since . I knew there might come a time when my situation here became complicated , but I was safe , as long as I knew where the transporter was . 'The way she looks at you with those eyes - she 's like an animal . ' 'When they brought that girl into the hospital , I had only been qualified six months . 'I wanted to throw up . ' And then the machine was uncovered . As soon as the air touched its surface , I could feel it . 'She 's just talking , she 's not even frightened of us , she 's just talking . ' So I found my Toshiko . My beautiful Toshiko . 'Gonna go for it now . ' Owen , NO ! Let her go , Mary ! Let her go ! Toshiko , tell them to give me the transporter . I can 't , Mary . 'It 's ridiculous - we 're unarmed , we 're just shouting at her . Not again . Please , God , not again . ' 'Knife has incisors on the blade . It 'll tear Tosh 's throat out . ' How 's this ? I 'll exchange Toshiko for that one . Your choice . ' No , no , not Gwen . ' Just put the knife down . Did you hear him ? He didn 't want to , did he ? 'She read my thoughts , she actually read my thoughts . ' 'What happened ? What did he say ? ' Please , don 't ... That 's what they think of you . That 's who you 've been working with for all these years . It 's not true , Tosh , don 't listen . But not me . Whatever I 've done , it doesn 't change the way I feel about you . We have a connection , Toshiko , something real . 'Toshiko ... Don 't move . 'Don 't do anything until I say . ' OK , you want the transporter , we want Toshiko . 'I 've been trained for this hostage situation ... 'For God 's sake , think ! ' I think that 's a fair swap . Keep the knife and I 'll give you the transporter myself . 'He 's just going to let her go . ' It 's a bluff , but I think it 's going to work . You smell ... different to them . That 's nothing . It 's when you compare teeth with a British guy , that 's when it 's really scary . What are you ? I don 't know . And you would have put me in a cage ? What 's happening ? Oh , that . I re-programmed it for you . It 's set to enable . Sort of now . What did she ... ? Has she gone home ? I reset the co-ordinates . Where to ? To the centre of the sun . It shouldn 't be hot . I mean , we sent her there at night and everything . You killed her . Yes . Just ask her . I will , but give me a bit of time . Say something to her . What do want me to do ? She 's been through enough . It 's really creeping me out . All right ! Owen , don 't be selfish about this . All right ! When did you have this ... I don 't know ... ability ? Just a couple of days . What did you hear ? A lot of it was noise . Emotions . References I wouldn 't understand . Yeah , and the rest ? The rest was none of my business . No . It wasn 't . I don 't know where this leaves us . Me neither . We can 't really take the moral high ground over this . This thing between me and Owen , it ... No , Gwen . What I did was an invasion . I wasn 't in control , I realise that now . But even so , I can 't ... I have to live with this . Not what I heard , but what I did to you . And my betrayal ? What do you mean ? I 'm living with mine . This should be my wake-up call . I should stop . But I won 't . What does that say about me ? I 'm not really in a position to make judgements . This is what I 'm saying , Tosh . Neither am I. Don 't let this ... It doesn 't matter . Sorry , forget it . What ? Don 't let this put you off . The last couple of days , you 've had a look about you . Love suited you . It 's funny . Such a small thing . It could be the most powerful piece of technology we 've ever found . It could tear down governments , wipe out armies . What do we do with it ? Your call . It 's a curse . Why couldn 't I read your mind ? I don 't know . Though I could feel you scrabbling around in there . I got nothing . It 's like you were ... I don 't know ... dead . I want that list for UNIT on my desk tomorrow , or I 'll ... What do bosses do in situations like these ? Y 'know , regular bosses . Can I get to beat people ? We 've got rules for that ! Red tape . Jack ... Something Mary said ... Probably the only honest thing she ever did say . I asked her why she gave it to me . And she said , " After a while it gets to you . " It changes how you see people . " How can I live with it ? There are some things we 're not supposed to know . You got a snapshot - nothing more . I don 't mean about Gwen and Ianto and Owen . I mean ... The whole world ... It doesn 't matter . Now these people are paying the price , ripped apart with your name written in their own blood . It brings people back to life . We just question the murder victims . Uh-oh , we 're in trouble . There 's got to be a link between the victims . Find the link , find the killer . It 's time Suzie came back . We 've been talking to the wrong corpse .

 What 'cha doing there kiddo ? Just throwing rocks Good , good . Get all that rock throwing out before you get married . It was either this , or being inside with Sarah and the Wedding Planner figuring out where all the flowers should go . Wise choice . Listen , before tonight , before , before things get crazy , I wanted to give you something . This was my dad 's and I jus ... I thought it would only be fitting . I 've never seen you wear it before . Well that 's because I never did . Your grandfather didn 't really like your mother , and you know , he thought marrying her was a mistake . He told me , to my face , that the day that I got married , an then he gave me this watch . So I never wore it . Dad ... are you trying to tell me something ? Unlike me , you have made .. the absolute right choice . Thank you , Oh here , that 's yours . I guess this is really happening , huh ? oh , a soon as they arrange those flowers , and you run out of rocks ... There 's a lot of rocks out here . Would you do me a favor ? If you and Sarah ever have a kid , try to treat him a little better than I treated you . No pressure , right ? I 'll see you inside , kiddo . Yeah , yeah Subtitle By Persian Boy

 Previously on Bionic Woman This saving the world thing ... I 'd like to give that a try . Anything else ? What are you doing ? I 'm trying to buy back your love because I 've been working so much . You get some bad ideas in your head these days , don 't you , Sarah ? It 's the bionics , isn 't it ? They 've changed me . Turned me into this thing . We think Sarah Corvus might be working with Anthony Anthros . Will 's father ? He escaped from prison . He tried to sell bionics to the highest bider . Am I ticking time bomb too ? I guess I just want to know the truth . About everything . I don 't like secrets , Jamie . You 're not gonna kill me twice , are you ? Oh we all know , that if your training is worth a damn , I should be able to take this crowbar and swing it as hard and as fast as humanly possible ... This is what you call " studying at Rachel 's house " ? Who the hell is she ? Nobody . - Jamie , stop ! - You lied to me ! You looked me right in the face and you lied . - You 're a piece of work ! - Are you insane ? This is the thanks I get for buying you those jeans ? What the hell is wrong with you ? You 're 15 . - What do you think you 're doing ? - I 'm living my life , Jamie . - It 's none of your business . - Yes , it is my business . Do you know she 's 15 years old ? You could go to jail ! - You said you were 18 . - Shut up ! We 're going home . What did you do to my toe ? It 's my toe , and why does it hurt ? What happened to the self-healing anthrocytes ? Well , you 're an early prototype , Jamie . As time goes on , we 're gonna discover countless imperfections . Do you have a foot fetish ? Actually , no , Jamie , I do not . I 'm pretty much just a simple boob man . You did this surveiling your sister ? She lied right to my face . Just looked at me and lied . " I 'm going to Rachel 's house . " Well , that 's what teenagers do . They lie . They get tatoos . They have wild sex , and then knock off liquor stores . Your toe is screwed . I 'm gonna have to shock that thing into submission . Now this shouldn 't hurt at all . On three . One . - You suck ! - Here 's what I think . You cannot be grudge a teenage girl the opportunity to make out in parked cars with older guys . It 's the lying . Is it this righteous indignation just a ... tiny bit hypocritical considering you 're a $ 50 million weapon - leaving a double life ? - That 's mean . I don 't really care so much about what she does . I know she 's gonna make stupid mistakes and all that . I just don 't want her to lie to me because then I can 't help her . That sounds good . Tell her that . Check it out . - Good as new . - You 're a genius . Let 's keep this between us , okay ? - Sure thing . - Thanks . I 'll see you , and I 'll raise you all in . Everything . That 's a lot of coin . You know , people say that men take all the risks . I 'm here to tell you it isn 't true . You all turn out to be a bunch of scared litlle boys . It 's disappointing . It really is . Sarah , put your hands on your head . My guess 's the fun 's over . This is my boyfriend . It 's an on again off again sort of thing . You know how it is . I kill all those people . He shot me in the head . Our friends call us the Bickersons . Isn 't that right , honey ? But you know what they say . At the end of the day , the most important thing ... in the world ... is love . I knew the game was fixed . I 'm sorry . You owe me $ 27,269.31 for the toe . How 'd you find out about that ? Your bionics represent the most advanced form of biotechnology known to man . It was developed to protect the human race , not spy on your delinquent sister . I find your whole proprietary attitude about my body to be deeply inappropriate . How 's the toe ? Take a look at this . My name is Marc Stevens . I 'm an american doctor working in Paraguay . I 'm being held against my will . They say that they 'll kill me unless ... A group that calls themselves the " sons of the red sand " took Stevens in Ciudad del Este two days ago . - They claim he 's clan . - Is he ? He 's American . That 's enough for them . He 's got some incredibly sensitive information , and they 're gonna behead him in 48 hours unless the CIA admits he 's theirs , which they won 't . So why is this our problem ? You mean besides he 's an american who would get his head chopped off ? I mean , why isn 't the military sending someone in ? Paraguay never passed any anti-terrorism laws . They 're not about to let the US mount an operation on their soil . - But we can ? - The two of you can . Anything that looks like special OPS is out . But an american couple moving about the city ? I wanna help this guy , but I don 't think I can fly off to Paraguay right now - Becca ... - Becca 'll be watched 24 / 7 by a surveillance team . Okay , I 'm in . Just ... What am I gonna tell Becca ? You 'll think of something . The eggs ! You were cooking ? Who are you making breakfast for ? You . Why are you making me breakfast ? About last night . - I just want to clear the air . I was ... - Fine . Look , I 'm sorry I lied to you . Yeah , I mean , shouldn 't have done it . It was dumb . Besides , that guy 's a creep anyway . Mean , usually those internet chat room guys , you know , they turn out to be reasonably cool . Oh , my God ! I 'm kidding . God , you think I 'm retarded ? - No , I don 't think you 're retarded . - Yeah , you do . So what 's going on with you ? Carly invited me up to Napa to ... celebrate her getting into law school . That should be fun . - We land on an airstrip . - An airstrip ? Is that different from an airport ? Yeah , it 's dirt . I have an asset in place , a local cop . He 's gonna help us locate Stevens when we get there . How can you land a 747 on a dirt runway ? No , it 's not a 747 . It 's a little gulfream . Really ? You okay with that ? Yeah , I 'm good . Do you have anti-anxiety meds ? Sedatives ? Anything in that area ? Hi , Jamie . How 's it going ? You look great . How 's Becca ? Stevens is running out of time . We have to go now . Jonas will take care of her . Okay ? We 're almost done . I 'm just getting started . Let him go , Sarah . Take him to the infirmary . You 're not helping yourself . Reflexes . Your reflexes were recalibrated through sensory neurons with your original surgery . That was hostility . You noticed . A girl likes to be noticed . Let 's cut to the chase . You 're having hand tremors , night sweats , anxiety , paranoia . Even paranoids have enemies . The bottom line is the medicine Anthros gave you barely gave you any relief . The truth is it probably made you worse . And you 're gonna fix me ? - My hero . - It 's not what you want . From you ? I want nothing . Kill me or let me go . You know , I tried that once before . It didn 't work . This time I thougt it 'd help . You don 't know how . Will was working on upgrades . I want Anthony Anthros . You tell me where he is , you get your life back . You 're full of crap , Jonas . And you 're getting worse . Who made me this way ? You 're a liar , Jonas ! A liar playing God ! My contact has a very good idea where Stevens is being held . He 's gonna meet us there . Hook us up with some transportation ... You okay ? I 'm scared of flying . I couldn 't find any drugs , and I think getting wasted before a mission is a bad idea . I just think you know , a hunk of metal in the sky . Counterintuitive . Okay . Let 's talk about something else . I 'm upset because I keep lying my sister about my job . You 're protecting her . You 're not lying . If she knew the truth about you putting your life on the line , I don 't think - she would be able to handle that ? - I don 't think I buy that . - Everybody should know the truth . - The world doesn 't work like that . But then how can you have trust ? Trust and full disclose is not the same thing . You trust me right ? - Relatively speaking . - But what do you know about me ? What have I disclosed ? - It is supposed to make me feel better ? - All you need to know is that we are a team and that I have your back . Isn 't that enough ? Thank you . Easy , tiger . Easy ... That 's your bionic hand . Sorry . We must hurry . No one can know we 've met . Remember , Paraguay is a complicated place . We have no law against terrorism . This group has a legimate business interests . Kidnap and ransom is legimate ? All the perimeter doors are alarmed . The only other access is through the venting system . But it 's blocked by an exhaust fan . It 'll take your head off before they will . Thanks . We 'll keep that in mind . If they catch you , I don 't know you . My police won 't help you . My opinion , for what little it 's worth , this is suicide . But you americans know all there is to know about handling these foreign situations , yes ? He 's an optimist . OK , we get in , we get him , we get out . Sure , easy there wasn 't supposed to be an alarm . Just get us in . You know how to disarm it ? Stevens ' life is ticking away . Just do it . Trust me . You 're a machine . Don 't think about it . Even if it 's not real , it 's still attached . I 'd like to keep it that way . Give me a second . You see ? Matter over mind . What now ? Are you crazy ? What the hell are you doing ? I suggest you follow my lead or you 'll be shot . You told me I could trust you . Beauty is supposed to be the mark God sets upon vertue . And are you God in that homily . She got less virtue than she bargained for . I know you don 't want to believe this , but every step of the way She had no bigger supporter than me . Why make her your enemy ? She needs help . Will came up with a fix before he was killed . Swap out the nerve bundle infuse new anthrocytes . She knows where anthros is . He 's been giving her treatment . Maybe if you fed her , she 'talk . Chicken , egg . Be her friend , Jae . You want to help her ? Help her help herself . At least we 're together . You 're out of your mind . We 're about to be executed . They want to make an example out of us to stevens , or they make an example out of him for us . Either way , that gets us to him I need you to lose the fear and go bionic . if I told you what I was going to do , you would 've backed out ! Friends of yours ? I believe , Dr. Stevens that you don 't believe what whappen to you if you don 't decode the contents of your flashe drive . Which is nothing compared to what will happen to her . Please , I 'm working as fast as can . Perhaps you need a little inspiration , it 's a multi-level asymtric encryption ! It 's gonna take time . Now could be a good time , Jamie . Jamie , now ! Jonas says he can help you . And he 's got every reason to lie . He 's also a man of self-interest . You 're valuable to him . He 's playing you . Getting off watching this dance . Or you 're playing . I want you to know you can trust me . I want you back . We all want something back . Believe if Jonas could help me , I don 't trust him . You trust me ? Bring me proof that jonas is telling the truth . That they made advancements they can use to fix me I might remember where he can find anthros . Take this rope . We 'll tie him and take him . take the rop tie his hands up . We gotta move . What are you gonna do to him ? No worse than what he was going do to you . You want answers , right ? And when you 're done , Take him down to the fan room . What about you and Stevens ? What about me ? He stays . What are you talking about ? You deciphered the flash drive . - You were stalling . - You read it ! What was on the flash drive ? Tell me . You . Blueprints , materials , everything there is to know about bionics . If you know what was on that drive , you know who gave it to me . To decipher , not to read . This doesn 't make any sens we came here to save him . And we would have . I 'm not gonna say anything . Yeah , until you 're caught , tortured , or your brother is taken . They put a machete to a pretty girl 's neck and you were gonna give it up . I was trying to save you . Take him down to the fan room . So you 're just gonna kill him , is that it ? Jamie , go . Go ! Far end of the building , fan room , I 'll meet you there , go . You let him go , he talks , you 're in the crosshairs . A target for people to catch and dissect . You won 't last a month . Then I won 't . Are you okay ? You 've been hit . Go through . Thank you . - What you did back there . - Stupid I 'm gonna get us both killed . I have no plan . You know that , right ? There 'll be supplies in here for your wound . - We can 't stop . - No , you can 't keep going . Can you get the lock ? Can you see what numbers to push ? Your eye , can you tell what numbers ? 2 5 6 9 . These are usually four digit codes . That gives us 24 combinations . Let 's try it in reverse . Highest probability . All right . Who gave you the flash drive ? I have a contact . A voice on the phone . When he needs help , he tells me where to pick things up . What about the terrorists ? Do you know who hired them ? I assumed it was just them . Somebody tipped ' em off to what I was doing . Your body 's in shock . You really are a doctor ? It 's not just a cover ? Yale medical school . Two-year residency at walter reed . Specialty in espionage ? I was always kind of a savant with word games and puzzles . How many words can you make out of the letters in yoo-hoo , that kind of thing . I was showing off one day at Walter Reed and a CIA guy recruited me . How bad ? The human response to a foreign object is to repel it And fight it like an infection . But you ... Aren 't human ? You have anthrocytes . The files say they 're designed to keep your body From rejecting the bionics . So they work to incorporate what 's foreign and not repel it . Doesn 't sound so bad . The anthrocytes are moving the bullet . It could damage other organs . I need to take it out . Now . She could be dead . No , she 's not . She 's still green . - It was your idea to send her in , Jonas - And you nearly got her executed ! You know the risk involved better than anyone , buddy . No , willingly surrendering a $ 54 million bionic woman is not in my play book . Well , it got us inside to get stevens and the flash drive . You don 't have the flash drive , and you don 't have Jamie . Well , how about I get off the phone so I can go and find her ? - You better . And Antonio ? You treat her like she 's expendable again , I won 't be this nice . Do not tell me how to do my job . I 'm gonna go and get your girl back . What are you doing here ? Nice to see you too . - Seriously , what are you doing here ? - Is everything okay ? Yeah , I just borrowed these from Jamie . Is she home ? No , she 's in Napa ... With you . Excuse me ? Exactly . What are you looking for ? What you promised Sarah . Proof of Will 's upgrades . You told me to get her trust . I 'm trying to get her trust . You didn 't trust me . There 's nothing here . No files at all . What is going on , Jonas ? I don 't know . So you lied to me ? I told you will was working on fixes , not that I had them . Apparently , the files are on a flash drive in Paraguay . How ? I don 't think we knew Will as well as we thought . Ah , damn it ! Sorry . Not what you want to be hearing from your surgeon . Are you holding up ? I 've been sitting here thinking about all the lies ve been told . All the lies I 've been telling , even to myself . How do you make peace with it ? You don 't . You do what you can . Sometimes you pay a price . Three years ago , a lie I deciphered lead to a bombing raid in Iraq . 87 civilians killed . Another 113 injured . I 'm sorry . So I came to triple border ... To atone . Doctoring people who have nothing . What about the CIA ? Occasionally they ask a favor . But now I only succeed at deciphering those things that I can live with . I can live with . If you had told the terrorists what you knew about me , they might 've let you go . Yeah , and I 'd have given them the technology to do what ? And then who would they have sold it to ? Do the files say why it does that ? It stops after a few minutes ? What ? It 's your bionic interface ... Failing ... And being reset . It keeps happening . It 's inherent in the system . And ? The anthrocytes function like an anti-rejection drug . But over time , they become fatigued . So they 'll replace them ? On the flash drive , they 've talked about a five-year ... projection . Until what ? Bionic systems cease to function . What does that mean ? What does that mean ? You 're gonna die . You can lead a horse to water , but you can 't make him drink . So that 's where we 're starting . With horses ? Mr. Ed won 't drink , you grab him by the mane , force him under . Hold him there long enough , he 'll swallow . The point is to interpret the saying . You do know your horses . You and your sister had one when you were little . Am I right ? And Anne named it Coco ? What happened to Coco ? People who live in glass houses shouldn 't throw stones . Or have sex without curtains . Me , I like throwing stones . Wakes people up . You 're caught between a rock and a hard place . Now you 're just trying to be funny . Actually , I 'm just trying to do my job , which as much as I don 't like it , it means trying to understand you . I 'm messed up , honey . See , now we 're getting somewhere . Does that make you all warm and cuddly inside ? You should know I don 't do warm and cuddly . You 're caught between a rock and a hard place . Well , we both know how that ends , don 't we ? Three . Three ? You can make three words out of yoo-hoo . Oh , yoo , and ooh . Actually , nine . You know , what I said ... I 'm sorry . No , it 's good to hear the truth for once . - He 's coming . - Who ? Quick . Around the back . Here . Hold on to this , wait here . - Wait , what are you ... - Just do it . There is no fix , is there ? Jonas is predictable , if nothing else . Tell me you love me . I love you . Let him go ! Stand down , stand down ! Sarah , stop . Seriously , is that the psychological way of talking me down ? - Let Jae go . - And you 'll what ? Help me ? - Where is he ? - Gone . Jamie , where is he ? You were gonna kill him . I was just doing my job . You kept me completely in the dark . Sometimes that 's what the job requires . I refuse to believe that killing an innocent person could ever make things right . Yeah , well , that information on the flash drive could save you . What we were doing here was for you . You think cause I cost $ 50 million , my life is worth more than his ? Oh , we can talk about that later . Give him up now . No . No ! Stevens is what we call collateral damage . Killing him saves you . Maybe one day you 'll understand that . You want Stevens ... You 're gonna have to get through me . And this time you 'll have to do it without a crowbar . I find this inappropriate workplace behavior . - Now who 's being inappropriate ? - You don 't want to fight me . You know what I 'm capable of . Just because you 're a machine doesn 't mean you can 't be beat . That hurt ? Yep . You 've gotta get out of here ... She took that pen from the tech . The one with the multi-fractured hands . She figured you 'd never help . The point is moot . She 's gone . So is Will 's flash drive . Seems Jamie and Antonio had a misunderstanding . That can be dangerous . Antonio 's doctor can attest to that . So if ... If Will 's work is gone , then what ? Sarah 's gonna die ? I wouldn 't want to be in her shoes . I have never been snowboarding . That seems insane to me now . I can 't believe I 've lived my whole life never having done that . My friends all head up to snow together . Usually in february . You should come . Oh , you know . Can 't plan that far in advance . Like to live in the moment ? Go for it . See it , want it , take it never look back at the carnage . Exactly . Life 's too short . You have no idea . What do you say you and I get out of here ? Okay . Five years ? Listen , five years is a lifetime in technology , Jamie , it 's generations . You didn 't think I had a right to know ? Yeah , I just didn 't want to tell you . - I wanted to protect you from ... - No , stop . This is my life . You will not treat me like this . I 'm entitled to know you will not lie to me . - It 's disgusting . - You 're right . You 're right I 'm sorry . My sister . We will find a way to fix this . Jamie , look at me . I will fix this . I 'll fix this . How was your trip ? Good . Yeah , you have fun with Carly ? Yeah , we hung out . It was cool ... Look , are you , like , having an affair with a married man or something ? What ? Carly dropped off your shoes . God , you know , I mean , you 're just like dad . You make these big pronouncements , but I can 't even trust a word you say . And you think that I 'm the liar ? Look , what is going on , Jamie ? Just tell me , okay ? I need to know . I deserve to know . I can 't . I love you the most . Remember when mom used to say that ? Yeah . Only she 'd say it so we could both hear . Now I love you the most . And I want to tell you everything . But I can 't , I ... Trust ... It 's supposed to be a two-way street . Yeah , I know , and it sucks . But you have to trust me , Becca . My new job is ... It 's complicated . I just ... I need to know that you 're never gonna leave me . I will never leave you .

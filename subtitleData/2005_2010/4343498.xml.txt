 There 's a lot of change going on with me . - Really ? - When I look back on my life , It just seems like it 's not my life I 'm looking back on . It 's a mid-life crisis . That 's all this is . It 's me again . I have left you three messages . You need to call me . Something 's happening to me , And I think you 're the only person Who 's going to understand what it is . For years , I put my job ahead of my family . Now I 'm eating cereal for dinner , and a strange man is answering my wife 's phone . That 's no way to live . So what did we win ? A compass . A broken compass . You can never change the past . It 's bad . If you want to change one thing ... That 's all you do . What if I could make it so that Danko Wasn 't interested in you anymore ? - Why do you want to do this for me ? - We 're both looking for redemption . I want my old life back . I go back to my apple martinis and overpaid lobbyists . Excuse me . Tracy ? Is that you ? Hello , governor . I 'm back . Nathan . Mom . What brings you to D.C. ? You cleaning out the garage ? Yes , as a matter of fact . Here , come look . Just what the doctor ordered : a trip down memory lane . Last we spoke , you said something About looking back on your life And it feeling like someone else 's . Well , Nathan , This is your life . Gee , mom , you didn 't really have to do that . I don 't recognize any of this stuff . Of course you do . Pick something up . Ma , really , I got to ... Here . Used to be your favorite toy . Uncle Tim bought this for me . When we took that trip up the coast . - I was in the back seat of the car . - That 's when you decided You wanted to be a fighter pilot . You remember ? Yeah , I remember it like it was yesterday . Literally . Is there something wrong , Nathan ? No , everything 's fine . Come on , what happened to you ? I mean , it feels like you fell off the face of the earth . It was family . It was a family crisis . It was complicated and dramatic , And it 's behind me . So , you 're back . I 'm back . And I 'm looking for work . Not anymore , you 're not . I can use you back in New York . That is , - if you 're willing to come work for me . - I 'd be a fool to turn it down . Terrific . - So what 's going on ? - I could use your help To ease some legislation through the mine fields . You know , cut a few corners , Charm a few regulators . It 's right up your alley , trace . - Right , baby ? - Not a problem , governor . Have dinner with me tonight . We can discuss the particulars . So happy to have my tiger lady back . - Noah , you got a minute ? - Sure , come on in . I thought you wanted nothing to do with me . I show you something . - That 's a very nice arm . - No , it ... There was a tattoo . - Right here . I noticed it last night . - Mystery tattoo ? No , it was a compass . Like the one you pulled out of the box . Mystery compass tattoo . I know where you 're going . I 'm not seeing things . It was there . - I thought you 'd help me ... - What are we going to do ? Seriously , are we going on the road , search for this speedy guy with knives , and uncover some giant conspiracy ? Not particularly . You want to get cut up again ? I don 't . That 's what I 'm telling you , I 'm not up for it . - That 's all . - Got it . So what am I doing here ? - Sorry to bother you , Noah . - Not at all . Any time . - What are you doing here ? - I had to ask your dad ... a question , clear my head up , but ... I 'm good . I got to go . I got to be at work in ten minutes . Ten minutes ? You live in New York City . - New power ? - Ask your father about it . Just a ... fishing expedition . Doesn 't amount to anything , it 's over . Can I get you something to eat ? A bowl of cereal ? Before you put that in ... The guy didn 't tell us he was diabetic . - I left you three messages . - I 'm so sorry , man , I 'm so sorry . - I 've been slammed . Are you okay ? - Yeah , I need to talk to you . - Can it wait ? - Five minutes . So what 's up ? - When did that start ? - A couple days ago . I 'm like a swiss army knife of superpowers now . It 's a new power every day . Guess it runs in the family . - There 's something else . - What ? I 'm seeing things . Memories . Images . Memories , but they 're not mines . Not exactly . I 'll touch something , and ... It 's freaking me out . I 've read about this . It 's called psychometrics . It has something to do with seeing the history of an object , where it 's been , what it 's experienced . So what I 'm seeing , it 's real ? Possibly . I don 't know , why ? What are you seeing ? - You remember Kelly Houston ? - Kelly Houston . Before or after she ran away and broke your heart ? I don 't think she ran away . I really don 't . I touched my old baseball hat , and I got a flood of images of her and me ... in a pool . I know how all of this must sound . But she was dead , and there was blood everywhere . - Somebody killed her ? - I don 't know . If what I 'm seeing is real , then yeah . - What would you do ? - You got to find the truth . Go by the house . Her mother still lives there . Millie ? Yeah . You want me to go with you ? It 's my mess . I 'll clean it up . Tell me the truth , Claire . Why are you here ? You checking up on me ? Can 't a daughter just drop in on her father unannounced ? I worry about you . Since mom 's gone and the company 's not around , you just seem plan-less . - You always have a plan . - I 'm fine . That " fine " sounds very unconvincing to me . You 're living off of cereal and Japanese take-out . That is a good point . Tonight , I order Italian . - What about a job ? - What about it ? It 's a down economy and all , but there 's something you can do . My particular skills aren 't that marketable . That is not true . You were middle management of Primatech Papers for over 20 years . Which consisted of lying to my family , breaking down doors , bagging and tagging . On the plus side , you are a people person . Look . Lumber salesman . Minimum five years sales experience . You do know that was a cover , right ? I never actually sold anything . Yes , but you don 't have to admit to that . Okay , say you 're at the interview , and I 'm the interviewer , and you 're the interviewee . Are we really ... Tell me , Mr. Bennet , what is your greatest strength as a salesman ? If they won 't buy from me , I can always just shoot them . What are you doing here ? Reminiscing about Kelly . I was in the neighborhood . Thought I 'd stop by . That calls for a drink . What can I get you ? Nothing . I 'm fine , thanks . Sit down , Nathan . Thanks . Nobody ever talks to me about Kelly . Guess they figure it 's a sore subject . Truth is , I 'm made of sturdier stuff . So ... ? I was just going through some old things in my office ... Started thinking about her . Got to wondering if you ... If I 'd heard from her ? I wish I could say that I have . Wish I could say she 's been living in the South of France . That she became an artist . That she has a daughter named Francoise . Do you ever wonder if maybe she didn 't run away ? To be perfectly honest , there was a time when I thought you knew more than you were saying . After all , we were away that weekend , but you were in town . And I knew that you and Kelly had been seeing each other . I never told your mother , but I hired a private investigator . Turns out , you 're in the clear . Kelly , in fact , used her credit card to buy to buy a one-way ticket to London Heathrow where she claimed her checked baggage , and no one has heard from her since . You think it 's possible something else might have happened ? Trust me , I 've been over this ad nauseam . Kelly was willful and spiteful and full of herself . Add to that , me not being ... the most attentive of mothers . No wonder she ran off . I 've got a hair , nail and body sculpting thing . - I don 't want to be late . - I understand . - So , you 'll show yourself out ? - Of course . Here you go . Broke out the good stuff . I 've already had too much . And my mom would kill me if she found out . There 's no way she 'll find out . You 're right . My folks won 't be back until Monday . Is that an invitation ? - Do you want it to be ? - You 've been drinking . I wouldn 't want to take advantage . Don 't be such a prude . You want it , Nathan ? Come and get it . Come on , Nathan . Come and get it . - You better give me that . - Come and get it . Come here . You wanted to see me ? Millie called . Chardonnay . She said you came to her asking questions about Kelly . Do You have any idea what your trip down memory lane is doing to that poor woman ? Kelly didn 't disappear . She died . I was there . I want to know why I can 't remember . How would I know ? Every time there 's a secret buried someplace , I find you with shovel behind your back . You should write mother 's day cards . I 'm gonna get to the bottom of this , so you can tell me , or ... Fine , I took care of it . And you don 't need to know the details . You made sure I wouldn 't remember anything . You were drunk and foolish , so , yes , I took care of it . I had the Haitian wipe your memory . I disposed of her body . I bought the plane ticket . - It was an accident . - It didn 't look like one , dear . So what would you have me do ? Her death would have ruined your life . I 'm just waiting for the part that makes any of this okay . I made a choice to protect my son . You want to vilify me for that ? Fine , I was vilified for so much less . But , please , Nathan , don 't destroy yourself over this . You 're gonna have Millie believe her daughter ran away because she was a bad mother ? Millie has made her peace with this . I suggest you do the same . I 'll be in touch . Did you forget something ? There 's something I need to tell you , and I 'm not sure how to do it . You all right , Nathan ? I can 't tell you how I know this . - I 'm not sure I should . - What are you talking about ? Say it . Kelly didn 't run away . She died . And I was there . It was an accident . And it was my fault . - She got on a plane . - There was no plane ticket . She died , Millie . And the whole thing was covered up by my ... family . What kind of twisted , pathetic game are you playing ? I 'm trying to tell you the truth for once . I think you should leave . Please . Go . I 'm sorry . You never answered . Greatest strength . I would d have to say that above all else , I am ... a company man . You won 't find anybody more dedicated to his job than me . See , that 's perfect . What lumber company wouldn 't hire you ? I 'm a real people person . What 's the matter ? I don 't know . It 's just , you know , kind of sad when ... you look back on your life and it hasn 't amounted to much . What are you talking about ? You have been trying to help people . Have I ? Because all I see is pain . I shot them , cuffed them , locked them up , wiped their memories , but I don 't remember actually helping ... anybody . That 's not true . - You 've helped plenty of people . - Yeah , name one . Me . Life changes . We all change . Sometimes you have to remember who you were to figure out who you want to be . Why do I suddenly feel like you 're the parent , and I 'm the kid ? We 'll take turns . - You don 't really want to sell lumber ? - Nope , not at all . Fancy meeting you here . - Am I that predictable ? - You live upstairs . - How are you ? - Okay . So what brings you to my neighborhood ? I got my old job back , with Governor Malden . That was quick . Good for you . Let 's celebrate . I 'll buy you a tuna roll . I 'm not hungry . So why are you here ? I don 't know . You got your life back , Tracy , and that 's what you wanted , isn 't it ? It just feels like something 's missing . Something needs to change . You got a job in government . - That 's a good start . - Malden isn 't about helping people . - Then quit . - I can 't . Many people would kill for my position . Life changes , Tracy . We have to change with it . Maybe you just can 't go home again . Remember who you were to figure out who you want to be . I got to go . I have a dinner with Malden , and I can 't be late . Thanks for the advice , though . Any time . I can 't tell you how great it is to have you back , Trace . - I missed you . - It 's nice to be missed . Cosmo still your drink ? One cosmo , please . Look at us . Just like old times . Kind of . This job ... I want it to be more . I want to set agendas , help people who can 't help themselves . So much for small talk . I want a job where I 'm making a real difference in people 's lives . Trace , you don 't have to work so hard to impress me . We both know what you bring to the table . Tell you what . Why don 't we skip dinner ? Let 's go upstairs . Make each other happy . Just like old times . Will you excuse me for a moment ? Sure , yeah . Don 't be long . Dear god . There you go . Everything okay , baby ? No . No , everything 's not okay . I don 't understand . I wouldn 't expect you to . Hello , yes . I 'd like to speak with someone in the homicide division . I 'll hold . I 've been looking for you . What 's the matter ? You are thinking about something . Is it the new people that Samuel 's bringing into the family ? You think he 'd be bringing in more If Joseph was alive ? I don 't know . It was his brother , And he has a right to his revenge . No matter what it means for the rest of us ? I 'll tell you what it means . I 'm the one who 's left to make all the decisions for this family . I 'm the one that decides which direction we travel . We were just talking is all . Come with me . Time to find another . You know you can tell me anything , don 't you ? Of course . If anyone tells you they 're dissatisfied with me , If you 're dissatisfied . I 'm not dissatisfied . Good . What are you doing ? Why are you showing him to me ? I show you what you need to see . Why would I need to see bennet ? He retired . He 's no longer interested in us . He may have changed his mind . Nathan seemed ... very confused . Wanted to make sure I heard his side of the story . It was upsetting To say the least . Well , Nathan has always been overly theatrical . You know , I 'm sure that 's why He 's drawn to the spotlight of politics . What exactly did he say ? I feel so silly telling you this . No , please . He 's my son . I want to know . He said that Kelly was dead . That he was with her when she died . I told him , " no , she bought a ticket , Got on a plane , never looked back . " Millie , I am so sorry That he bothered you with this . Nathan ... Nathan just hasn 't been himself lately . You know how much I 've always cared for Nathan . I apologize for his behavior . No one should have to go through that pain twice . I can honestly say ... I don 't care anymore . I just hope Kelly 's happy . I think that 's About as close to closure as I 'm ever going to get . Would you excuse me just one second ? Hello ? The package is delivered . Wonderful . Thank you so much . Something important ? - Not at all . - Good . Where were we ? Closure . Of course . To closure . To closure .

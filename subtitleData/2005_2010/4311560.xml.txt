 Previously on Heroes ... You 're supposed to be a hero ! I don 't think she wants to be my princess . Dr. Suresh ... can we count you in ? Finally took the bait . They caught up with me in Cairo . I 'm in . And you and I will bring this whole company down . We are all in grave danger . Our past has caught up with us . No ! - I 'm West . - Claire . Are you one of them ? Or one of the others ? I figured that you 'd rather have a real one . We need to talk about the nightmares . There 's nothing you can do . Molly ! I wanna help you . What the hell are you doing here ? Who are you ? What 's your name ? I don 't know . He 's awake . Where am I ? Home . Just tell us where you stashed the iPods . We 'll cut your binds . You 'll be on your way . As square a deal as you 're likely to find . I didn 't take anything . Right . With the thousands of shipping containers coming through cork harbour every day , you just happen to be having tea in the one we were sent to rob . I don 't know how I got in there . You might wanna consider remembering , boy . You 're in a bad spot . My wedding ring fell in with the eggs . We do have a colander , dear . No need to be flashy . It 's no big deal . It isn 't until it gets you noticed . I can 't even be myself at home ? It 's bad enough that I have to be all fake at school . We simply asked you to lay low . High school doesn 't work like that , dad . You lay low , and you get noticed more than anyone . They have metal detectors for people who lay too low . I have to be someone . You know I trust you , Claire . I mean , we got you your own car . You know , it may be easy for you to pretend that you 're the most boring photocopier in the world . But I can 't not be what I am . Whatever that is . Making copies is not my job . Keeping this family safe is my job . And if that means that I don 't have time to make you breakfast in the morning or I have to dress up in this stupid shirt so that we stay invisible and nobody finds us ... then that 's what I 'll do . And I need you to do the same . I forgot how weird it must be for you to play normal after being ... whatever that was . Don 't you feel sorry for your dad . Compared to the life I had ... Normal 's a pretty nice vacation . Thanks . You 're welcome . Have a good day . Did you see this ? I knew this would happen . Kaito . How 'd you know this was gonna happen ? Hey . That 's not the way we do things anymore . No more secrets . That was the deal . This was done by a very gifted artist in New York . Isaac Mendez . Everything he 's ever painted has come true . Except for a series of eight . I was only given the first . There 's seven more . What 's in the other paintings ? I don 't know . But I 'm gonna find them . What , are you waiting on an invitation ? Oh , no . I 've just spent so much time on that side of the tape , I was just savouring the moment . Yeah , well , welcome to the big leagues , detective . Let 's hope you survive . All right , got Kaito Nakamura . 70 , a Japanese national . CEO of Yamagato Industries . Now , he fell out of the sky onto Central Park West with this in his pocket . That look familiar ? Uh , no . No , I 've never seen this before . Well , Mr. Masahashi here is a witness . He says that he saw Mr. Nakamura being pushed by someone who went over with him . But we 've only got one body . Well , either the killer fell 20 stories , got up and walked away , or flew away . You know somebody that can do that ? Ah . We , uh , found a fingerprint on the photo . Got a match . Angela Petrelli . We need to bring her right in . Mr. Masahashi . You ever seen this symbol before ? Yes . It is a Kanji . It means , " Great ability , Godsend . " Ability ? It is the crest of Takeizo Kensei , a famous hero in Japan . Mr. Nakamura used to read the Kensei stories to his son , Hiro . I need to talk to him . So do I. You must be sober ! If we don 't go after Yaeko right now , she 'll be killed ! Who 's Yaeko ? The girl you 're supposed to fall in love with ! The one who hates me ? Yes , before I came back in time and ruined everything , She was supposed to be your princess , and you , a Hero . You look like a fish when you talk . No , I promise , if you do this , they will tell the story for 400 years ... minimum ! Like a giant carp . This video demonstrates the Newt 's amazing ability to re-grow a completely working limb . But newts are not the only creatures with this talent . Thanks to millions of years of combined mutation , Lizards are capable of cellular regeneration . You mean like people who can heal themselves ? No , not people , Claire . Lizards . And raise your hand , please . But it 's possible , right ? For people to be able to do that too ? I mean , theoretically . Well , there 's a lot of controversial , though promising , work with stem cells . So we might be able to culture whole organs and limbs for people who need them ? I guess the next step for us is phasing out the extra parts . We 're not using the appendix anymore , or grinding bone with our wisdom teeth . We don 't even really need a pinkie toe for balance . It 's all just ... junk in our DNA . I 've read that some people might have evolved a different code already . Is that possible ? I 'm afraid you are gonna need an advanced degree in genetics to get at those answers . And I hope you thank me in your dissertation . What ? Oh , so how 'd you like the jet ? A lot better than flying coach , huh ? I didn 't agree to work with you for the comforts . Still , it doesn 't hurt . I can 't help people with abilities unless I have access to all your records and your labs . Of course , of course . And right now , I need to get you back on that plane because - I have your first assignment here somewhere . - Assignment ? I thought you said your company kept its medical samples here . Not samples . A man . In Port-Au-Prince . He turned up sick . Weakness , tremors , loss of abilities . He 's dying . The virus . If there 's another case , there could be some reservoir of infection . That 's what I need you to find out . To date , there have only been two presentations of the disease . Your sister in 1974 , and Molly Walker four months ago . If there is actually a third case ... then it is spreading . I 'll test him . If it 's true , I 'll bring him back as soon as possible . Oh , and , doctor ... as of now , your blood is the only cure for that virus . Try not to get yourself killed . Bet you were prettier yesterday . I like your necklace . What does it mean ? I wish I knew . Let 's try an easier one . What 's your name ? I don 't know . It 's not your day , is it ? I 'm Caitlin . You know that much now . Caitlin . What are they gonna do to me ? I don 't know . Whatever my brother thinks is best . Your brother ? Did he send you in here ? He 'd pitch an epic fit . Thought I 'd try a kinder tack . Thing is , this job , it 's bigger then you and a couple of quid . They pulled it for this man named McSorely . Promised delivery today . So what happens if the guy doesn 't get what he wants ? You have to remember something . Anything ... a name , a face . First thing I remember is your brother and his crew finding me . Then the big guy came at me and ... and an electrical short blew tuko on his arse ... I heard the story . The spark . I think it came from me . My hand . - I ... I know that it seems - - is it possible ? I 've just rung out ... a lot of your blood . You don 't have a mark on you . I do not want your cure . Without it , you could die . God gave me power . I abused his gift , so he took it away . Now I suffer his judgment . Then perhaps we should leave it to God to decide . The chances are you carry one of 100 viruses I can do nothing about . If you somehow carry this one virus , there is only one cure . The distillation of my own blood , and I was guided to you . Surely that 's a sign . Just the same as your suffering . A sign of what ? That God isn 't quite done with you yet . So , my friend , shall we see if he still offers redemption ? Keep an eye on him . If he so much as lays an inconsiderate fart , you grab the gun . What am I , 12 ? Always . Come on . Come on . Sorry , fellas . Ricky and the boys just left . Aye , I saw . We 're not here for Ricky . Lucky then . I 've just tapped a barrel . Two pints ? No , thanks , love . We came for you . So ... lizards , huh ? Tell me you didn 't just time that so I 'd walk right past you . I figured you 'd be more into whales or something . Unicorns . You know , you make a lot of assumptions . Is my hair really that blonde ? I think it 's cool , actually . I 'm sort of into genetics too . I didn 't say I was into genetics . You don 't have to hide everything interesting about you . Biology is supposed to be our destiny . But people forget ... genes can change . I thought guys like you were supposed to sit at the back of the classroom and hate everything . I just found this book . It 's by some Indian guy . I can barely even pronounce his name . It 's about everything you 're talking about . People who 've evolved . There 's a whole chapter on regeneration . Sorry , I , uh , left all my awesome genetic textbook reading for the summer vacation . You should see it . I-I could bring it over . Get you on your way to your PHD You know , I don 't really care that much . I was just kind of bored in class . Really ? Yes , but if you like lizards , that 's awesome ... have fun . And I gotta go home . Where 's my car ? Your blood is clearing the viral load . Seems you have this disease after all . How are your hands ? Steady as faith . I prayed your cure would not work . If I prayed , I would have asked the same . The thought of this virus finding you , out here . If it spreads ... so you did not believe what you said . About God sending you to cure me . I have trouble believing in any god that would allow a pathogen like this to exist . It killed my sister . Seems like it 's becoming even more virulent . With a replication rate this aggressive , you would have been dead by morning . The people I work with will want me to bring you in for observation . I have a plane . You work for people ? A company . Of course . There 's always a company . Where is he ? Where is the Haitian ? The Haitian ? Isn 't he in Haiti ? We 're in Haiti . You 've been out of contact for hours . I was in your office . You gave me an envelope , said ... a man may have the virus . That I was to cure him . He wouldn 't have been able to take your memory unless the vaccine worked . So ... apparently it did . Full recovery . Thank you , Dr. Suresh . My memory ? I 'm sorry . Well , at least we 've contained the virus . We 'll just chalk this up to a rookie mistake . Hey . Five-pound bag of Gummi Bears . Receptionists love them . A well-stocked candy dish makes them feel popular . Dad , if I told you something , will you promise not to freak out ? My car kinda got stolen . My god , Claire . My heart just about stopped . I know . What 's a stolen car when you 're running for your life ? Not that ... look , I loved the car , and if you ever got me another one , I promise I will never leave it unlocked , ever again . You left it ... unlocked ? Claire ... I have to be able to trust you . And not just with the car , with everything . I know . I made a mistake . We can 't afford mistakes . 'Cause we 're in hiding , and it 's dangerous . - That 's right . - Oh , great . I 'm in hiding because of something I can do , and I don 't even know what that is . You know enough . But I don 't even know how it works . Or what my limits are . I mean , if I cut off my arm , would it reattach itself or would I grow a new one ? We shouldn 't be discussing this . You 're the only one I can talk to about this . I mean , I could be missing my opportunity to help people . If my skin can grow back after I boil it in with the eggs , then maybe my blood can help someone who got burned , or ... or someone who 's sick . I don 't even know if I can get sick . That 's enough , Claire ! Look , you can yell at me all you want about the car , but this is what I am ! I have kept you out of danger your whole life so you wouldn 't have to find your limits . Because if they find you , that 's what they 'll do . They 'll cut you , they 'll test you . And they will push you so far past your capacity for pain that you 'll wish you could die . Believe me . You may feel confined here , but this is far freer a cage than the one they 'd put you in . I 've gotta get back to work . You and Nakamura . Witness said you had a fight yesterday . We were old friends . Sometimes simple conversations can be misconstrued . Hmm . He said you slapped him . He made an off-hand comment about my son 's death . I found it distasteful . You 're a major shareholder in Yamagato Industries . That stock 's been in the toilet for months now . You think I killed Kaito over money ? Most common motives are money and sex . Well , I don 't need the money , and I wasn 't sleeping with him . Not for a long time . You recognize that symbol ? Yes , it 's the logo of my husband 's law firm . Why draw it across Nakamura 's face ? I don 't know . " Because we did something terrible , and now someone wants revenge " . Would anyone want revenge on him , maybe ... on you ? Who said anything about revenge ? I want my lawyer now . Who wants revenge , Mrs. Petrelli ? Stand down , Parkman . She cried " Uncle " . Get out of my head ! Mr. Petrelli . I know you . Detective Matt Parkman . We met in Texas when you came in to lawyer your brother out of jail . Look , I 'm sorry about Peter . Follow me . I 'll show you to your mother . She 's not gonna want to see me . Look , I just came to get her out . Then why 'd she ask us to call you ? She doesn 't have anyone else . That 's not possible ! Stand back . It 's gonna be all right , mom . It 's gonna be okay . Who did this to you , Mrs. Petrelli ? Aren 't you gonna say anything ? About what ? About those things you did . I didn 't do anything . Make up a story . Tell me you lost your memory of tonight too , but don 't pretend I 'm stupid . You had to knock the piss out of him , didn 't you ? The fella you put through a wall was McSorely 's son . A sadistic bastard , but his old man loves him . And you just made him even uglier . Fine , next time , I 'll leave him alone with your sister . Don 't you mouth off to me . You turned a fixable monetary problem into a blood feud . Ricky ! You 're gonna make this right . We 'll do another job . Something big enough we can drop a fat stack on his desk and get him off our backs . I 'm not a thief . Maybe not . But you certainly handled those two like a pro . And that makes you something . Now , doesn 't it ? What 's to say I don 't do the same thing to you and walk out of here ? I thought common courtesy would do it . No ? Then maybe this . You might want this ... Peter . My name is Peter ? Sounds about right , doesn 't it ? Just something I read . This here is everything you had on you when we found you . Credit cards , maybe a train ticket . Could even be a love letter . It 's all yours ... you just have to help us with one little job . What do you say ... Peter ? Hello ? Mr. Kensei ? Mr. Kensei ? You stole my armour and left me with all . Who do you think you are ? I only did it to save Yaeko . And to show that Takeizo Kensei is not a drunk , but a hero . - And I did . - You did ? Yes . They 're already telling of your bravery . And what exactly did I do on this day ? You disarmed 11 men and rescued a beautiful girl . I 'm to believe you did all that and took no credit ? All right , Carp , I 'm in . Really ? I don 't know what brand of fool you truly are , but it appears listening to you will grant me more reward . - And more of her . - It will ! Mm-hmm , then you can make me the hero she sees in me . As long as you stop drinking . No promises . I 'm sorry , carp . Maybe I 'll be a Hero next time around . No ! You cannot die ! You 're working late . Night shift . Don 't ask . Was it a productive trip ? You should have the answer to that yourself very shortly . And you didn 't arouse any suspicions ? I don 't think so . Bob seemed more angry at himself for trusting the bungling professor . They 'll be watching me more closely now . That 's to be expected . Don 't worry . I 'll find the other paintings myself . Are you sure ? You 've given me everything I need . Welcome to Copy Kingdom . How can I help you ? Turn that off . That is salt in the wound for poor Mr. Muggles . I 'm sorry . That was very inconsiderate of me . You 're right . It doesn 't help to avoid it . Well ... guess it 's just you and me . Come on , grow back . No way .

 Look . Part of me would love to kick some chrome-plated ass with you guys , but it 's not going to happen . I just got other plans . Other plans , what the frak is that ? Nora . So what ? I got a wife and a kid . You don 't think I worry about them ? What kind of future are we gonna leave them if we just lay down and quit ? That 's just a spineless excuse . Duck 's no coward , Chief . He made his choice , we made ours . Let 's leave it at that . Frak that . We give thanks for the food you have presented us . May this harvest be spared the blight . So say we all . So say we all . So say we all . We picked up all the weapons from the other sites . They 're in crates marked " machine parts . " Smuggle them over here a few at a time . Wait a minute . You want to hide firearms in the temple ? Something wrong with that ? This is sacred ground . The Cylons respect that , which is why they leave the temple alone . And that makes it the perfect hiding place . But it 's sacrilege . Well , I 'll tell you what . You say a prayer , ask the Gods to forgive us . We move the guns in tonight .

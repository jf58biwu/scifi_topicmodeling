 Hello , my name is Violet and I was born into a world you may not understand . Coming up . Holding airspeed . Echo altitude . Forward and lateral drift . Numbers falling fast from here . On my mark . Three , two , one , mark . Time lock engaged . Valves , primary and secondary ... Compositive pressure reached . Five ... - Freeze ! - It 's a trap . Stay where you are ! Don 't move ! The man 's down . All clear , sir . Touch nothing , obviously . Do not leave the building . Squadrons initiate Area 14 procedures . - Hemophages . - No surprise . Flat-space technology . Dimension-compressing . Very rare . It 's odd . What was their exit strategy ? How 'd they expect to transport the blood out of here ? - Unless there was no exit strategy . - Then what 's the point ? What if they didn 't come to take blood ? What if they came to infect it ? My God . Cross . Poor bastard . Yes , I was born into a world you might not understand . The trouble began when an American weapons lab discovered an obscure virus in Eastern Europe that had been around for centuries . They tried to modify it to create faster and stronger soldiers . Instead , they created a more contagious form of the disease a strain called HGV , Hemoglophagic Virus . And what do you know , the disease got out . And that 's when everything changed . As previous ages were defined by terrorism this one was defined by a fear of disease . Because one of the side effects of the disease was longer teeth the media decided to call it vampirism . I guess it sold more papers . The medical establishment took it upon itself to protect its public . At first , requiring victims to wear identifying armbands . Then rounding them up in special camps and facilities . Until finally , people just stopped hearing from them . The day the trouble began for me was the day I learned I was pregnant . Violet , my God . The same day I lost my husband my future , my life . And I , too , disappeared deep inside a faceless camp subjected to the indignity of a forced life of endless examination dissection , experimentation . Like others , the disease started to progressively change me physically . My eyesight was sharper . My hearing , more acute . Bones , stronger . Healing faster . Life span , shorter . A lot shorter . Twelve years , maximum , infection to death . Unlike others , I converted with only a mild sensitivity to light . Like others , however , I required frequent transfusions and it didn 't help that I was pregnant . And , no , we weren 't superhuman . Though we were a lot faster and a lot stronger than everyone else we die just like everyone else . And just like everyone else , without help , we stayed dead . And though I was resuscitated back to life for further experimentation the one I 'd carried inside me for nearly nine months , my baby wasn 't so lucky . Those few still on the outside embraced the slur bestowed upon them , " vampires " formed a resistance went underground and began fighting back . And so began the Blood Wars . And now , the leader of the militant , medical establishment running this phobic world is Vice-Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus . - Vice-cardinal . - As you know our campaign against the Hemophages has been highly effective . We 've managed to eradicate almost all of them . But , sir , the few that are left have proven incredibly determined . Terrorist attacks are at their highest level ever . It 's not because they 're determined . It 's because they 're desperate . Because they know we 're on the verge of wiping them out completely . For the last 10 years in partnership with Laboratories for Latter Day Defense I 've overseen the development a weapon that can locate and kill every Hemophage on the planet in days . - Is there an ETA , sir ? - Now . A courier is retrieving it to bring here to the Archministry as we speak . XPD-154 . Clearance , classified courier . I 'm expected . Reverse-engineer DNA identification in process . Remove your head-covering . Remove your eye-covering . Preliminary verification substantiated . Please have a seat . - Mind if I ask what 's on the menu ? - The usual . Retinal testing to detect the presence of contacts or dyes . Metabolic sensing to make certain your metabolism is within human range . Pulse , respiration . Just have to make sure you 're human . If you were a Hemophage we 'd already have detected tissue repair at a microcellular level . So , what would happen if one were to fail any of these tests ? Nothing good . Please remove all articles of clothing and proceed into the scanner . Your clothing and personal items have been sterilized , XPD-154 . - May I ask you a question ? - Feel free . - Do you know what this is about ? - Should I ? No , it 's highly classified . I 've been cleared to debrief you because your consciousness of the gravity of this situation may increase your motivation to complete . I 've never failed to complete . The Hemophages are a dying species on the verge of nonexistence . We 've developed a weapon that will push them past that brink , into extinction . If this weapon 's so important why not have it delivered by armored convoy ? The convoy you refer to is departing as we speak . The Hemophages will do anything in their power to stop and immobilize it . It is , of course , a decoy . XPD-154 , you 'll be receiving a case containing a weapon . I don 't have to tell you . Under no circumstances should you open it . You 're right . You don 't have to tell me . Identify . XPD-154 . Clearance , classified courier . Copy , XPD - 154 . We 've been expecting . Everything in order , XPD-154 ? One hundred percent , comrade doctor . You 're quite certain everything is in order ? Positively . Enter your DNA to confirm receipt . I can only confirm receipt of the container , not its contents . That 's acceptable . Opening the case is strictly forbidden . You understand this ? Perfectly . The contents are set to self-destruct in event of non-delivery in exactly nine hours from now . What is your condition , XPD-154 ? Are you functional ? XPD-154 . Clearance , classified courier . - Get on the ground ! - On your knees ! - Get down ! - What is going on ? You were entered and processed 15 minutes ago . Then it wasn 't me , you dumb son of a bitch . Check my ID . You 've got a mite . I repeat , XPD-154 , are you functional ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I 'm 100 percent functional . Security breach ! Security breach ! Stage yellow alert ! Stage yellow alert ! Intercept , intercept . Inner defense vault . Unarmed intruder ! Unarmed intruder ! Facility infiltration . All security forces at stations . All security forces at stations . Facility infiltration . All security forces at stations . How did a Hemophage get past the screens ? Don 't know . Maybe meta-suppressants to subordinate blood characteristics . All security forces at stations . Facility infiltration . All security forces at stations . All security forces at stations . - How did she do that ? - She must have some sort of gravity leveler . Whatever it is , it 's ours now . She 's not going to make it out alive . Sir , we 've ID 'd her . Plague victim . She was confined to this facility for experimentation until she escaped after the forced termination of her pregnancy 12 years ago . Violet Song jat Shariff . Tell me I 'm wrong . - You 're wrong . - Why are you doing this ? Because I hate humans with every fiber of my being and I 'll kill every single one of them almost as quickly as they 'll try and kill me . - You used to be human . - But not anymore , right ? I got sick , and now I 'm something less than human . Something worthy of extermination . It 's academic now , isn 't it ? You won 't make it out of here with that case . Watch me . - She 's on the ceiling ! - Shoot ! Shoot ! - It 's me . - Did you get it ? Yeah . But they 're serious about not letting me keep it . Fine . The objective is the destruction of the weapon . If you can 't make delivery , destroy it . Copy that . Will determine nature and destroy . No , V. The attack on the blood bank failed . You cannot . Under no circumstances can you look inside that case . If you are compromised , you must destroy it immediately . - Read ? - Read . Oh , shit . - It 's me . - 3-D me . - Are you clear ? - Negative . They 're everywhere . - I don 't know if I can make it . - You 're carrying the bomb ? - Of course . - Then detonate it . Now . It 'll level the entire block . May I suggest an alternative ? Open the case and use the weapon . Negative . Do not open that case , V. Detonate right now . Nerva , listen . You know it doesn 't matter to me . I 'll be dead in 36 hours , no matter what . But every human for a quarter mile doesn 't have to die with me . I 'm telling you this is not subject to debate . The entire fate of our race is tied up in that case . Detonate the bomb , destroy the case , destroy everything . Now . What about the Archministry ? Goodbye , V. V , I said goodbye . Yeah . Goodbye . We got her . We got visual . - Third quadrant . - She 's in the crowd . Stay on her . It 's not her . Go ! Go , go ! - Seal all quadrant . - Check it out . - V , what the hell is going on ? - I 'm clear . I told you to destroy the weapon . I said , I 'm clear . You have the case ? - Affirmative . - Bring it in . - What 's your status ? - The Needle . In the Chinois Gau . Ten minutes . Bravo , V. Bravo . No one but you could have pulled this off . It 's not a weapon . What are you talking about ? It 's not a weapon . It 's a child . A human child . You opened the case . What difference does it make ? I risked my life for nothing . I think I had to know what I was willing to die for . - You see ? Nothing . - Nothing . It 's not a weapon . It 's a child . It 's both . It 's a weapon and a child . Its blood is swarming with cultured antigens that would kill all of us on contact . If they atomize its tissues into the atmosphere it would be like insecticide to people like you and me . It would find us , and it would kill us . All of us . Nerva , wait . If there 's an accelerator for HGV in this child 's blood then so is the counter-analog for decelerating it . What are you saying , V ? A cure ? Wouldn 't it be better than infecting innocent people ? This child could provide the choice . If there 's a choice , V , I 've already made it . It 's a child . You can go now . Your work is done . It was a projection . Don 't over-think it . Just turns out I was right . We 're getting the hell out of here . - She went up . - So go after her . The Blood Chinois control the top 10 floors of this building . Whatever they want , give it to them . You 're not Archministry . You 're not even vampire ... You 're Blood Chinois . Let me pass . Sorry , Violet . Can 't do . You 're going to lose resources , Kar . Can 't be helped . But I don 't think you 're going to make it off this roof . Watch me . Hey . What are you doing up there , huh ? Hey . It 's a nice view , huh ? Why don 't you help me up so I can see it too . Here . Give me your hand . Give me your hand . Help me up . Come on . It 's okay . Come here . What do you think you 're doing ? You trying to get yourself killed ? Come on . Stop it . Seal the building . Any other Phages inside , I want them hunted down and killed . Violet Song jat Shariff . Seal the Needle . Hunt down and kill any Hemophages inside . Easy , Violet . - Do you know who I am ? - How could I not ? Tyrant . Egomaniac . Narcissist . That about sums it up , doesn 't it ? Yes , it may be true . I may have quirks . But that doesn 't mean I 'm stupid . And it certainly doesn 't mean that you make a single move without me knowing about it . You would 've killed me a long time ago . Listen , the boy is useless to you . He 's laboratory-bred , vegetative , practically brain-dead . Just give him to me , and you 're on your way . And then you can use him to kill me and everybody like me . He 's not what you think . No ? What is he then ? He 's my son . - Hey , Daxus ? - What ? You 're full of shit . Cover your ears . Cover your ears ! Metro Five is boarding . Stand clear . Doors closing . Damaged ? Are you damaged ? What am I doing ? Hey ! Park it . Right there . Don 't make me have to tell you twice . Sit . Don 't get any cute ideas either . The only reason I saved your life is because whatever is in your blood can save mine . If they corner us , suffer no delusions I will kill you . - S Squadron entering station . - Damn it ! Will detain and search train . Metro Five is boarding . Just stick close . I know somebody that can help . Hello ? Hey , remember me ? Do you have any idea how serious this is ? These people will kill you without even thinking . In fact , they have thought about it , and that 's exactly what they intend to do . So I suggest you straighten up before your actions start to impact my ability to survive . Look I 'm just trying to do what 's good for you , okay ? But you gotta stick by me . Stick by me . Garth , it 's me . I screwed up . I screwed up bad . The case had a kid in it . - I crossed Nerva . - I know . He called . Don 't even think about bringing it here , V. Damn it , this kid might have the answer in him . Now , I 'm just gonna be lucky to get him out of here alive . - I need your help . - I 'm sorry , V. My research is too important to jeopardize for a single child . Goodbye , V. What part of those bullets whizzing by your head didn 't you get ? Do you understand anything I 'm saying to you ? Okay , let 's start simple . They had to call you something , right ? You have a name ? I 'm Violet . Hi , pleased to meet you . Your turn . Go . Six ? You ? We gotta go . Damn it . Give me your arm . Give me your arm . Now , you listen to me , Six , or whatever your name is I might not be able to get you where I want to go but I 'll get your blood there . Give me your arm before I take the whole thing . You think those people are bad ? Well , let me tell you something . The real monster you don 't want knocking down your door is me . If I scream we 'll both be dead . Daxus doesn 't know you can speak , does he ? What do you know about what 's going on ? There 's a war going on to the death between humans and Hemophages . And , Six , you 're a human . And I 'm a Hemophage . Wait . Listen , do you remember I said there was something in your blood that could save my life ? Well , Daxus , he put something into your blood . He grew something there . And whatever that is , those antigens they may hold the key to saving my life but they were put there first and foremost to kill me . To kill me and everyone like me . So these men ? Yeah , Six . They 're after you . Right now , you 're the most valuable object on this planet . Unbelievable , V. You jeopardize everything by coming here . The humans want me . Nerva wants me . I don 't have any place left to go , Garth . Besides you have all my guns . So , what 's his story ? You tell me . Can you make an assessment ? I 'll need to draw some blood . It 'll take a few hours . Sweeper Team A , inform Archminister Daxus we have the remaining Hemophages cornered on the 21 st floor . - They 're right behind me . - The lights . Go night-vision . Take them apart . Switching to emergency backup lighting system . So are you going to kill me ? Think you can ? I think you and I have matters of mutual self-interest to discuss . Sit down . Humans are celebrating something . Where is this ? When I was a kid when I was just a little girl I used to dream about this old , dusty road . And this road would go on as far as the eye could see . There was all these little white flowers growing around the edges . And it was such a peaceful place . It was a happy place . But then you realize when life settles in around you places like this don 't exist . You 're dying . Yeah . I am . I 'm sorry . Do you read Thaihindi ? All right . Look . " Comrade . " " Lover . " " Wife . " And this one ... This one was gonna say " mother " but I got sick and all that became impossible . You 're not looking so good . I need to transfuse you . Just be thankful you didn 't convert with light sensitivity too . You do this ? - What is it ? - I 'm not sure . It looks chemical but it seems to be done in the pre-collapse form of Western notation . It was probably him . What is he ? I know what he 's not . He 's not someone who has a single molecule of vampiral antigen in his blood . That 's what he 's not . He 's not someone who 's any good to us . We can 't reverse-engineer a cure out of his blood . - What ? - lf that 's not bad enough , the kid 's hot . Practically radioactive . He 's got a tracking device in him that 's accurate to about 100 meters . We 're shielded in here . I don 't understand . Why would Nerva want me to get him so badly ? And why were the humans guarding him so closely ? I don 't know . But whatever they did put in the kid , Violet , it 's killing him . Some kind of aggressive , antagonistic protein . Very predictable decay . He 's got a shelf life of about eight hours . The kid 's toast , V. Why are you doing this ? He 's just a child . It 's a human child , Garth . And besides , what you 're doing here is too valuable to jeopardize . Goodbye , Garth . You 've got a tracking device in you . We 've got to get moving before it locks on . Come on . Daxus . My phone number changes every 60 seconds . Disposable phone printing . Thank you . Garth , it 's me . They 've been tracking my phone . You better get moving . - Okay . - Violet . Maybe it 's me . Come on . Violet , wait . What are we doing ? I would be neglecting my duties if I didn 't get a growing boy fed , wouldn 't I ? Credit card . All right , so you take this over there and see if you can 't find us something to eat . Go on . Six . You should really put your mask up . Goodbye , Violet . - It 's urgent . - Response team moving out . Alpha Squad , Alpha Squad . Alpha Squad , we have visual . What am I doing ? It 's not him . - Secure lockdown . - Initiate area-quarantine procedures . Six . Wait . Six ! Sorry , V. Violet Song jat Shariff . What are you thinking ? We 're not Blood Chinois . We 're as fast as you . We 're as strong as you . Yeah . But are you one-tenth as pissed off as I am ? Careful , V. Gunfire will attract the human security teams . You might win the battle , but you 'd lose the war , V. V , wait . Don 't you realize what this child has in him ? I don 't care what this child has in him . It 's not a vampiral antigen , but a human antigen . Lethal enough to kill every human on the planet . Why would humans create a human antigen ? What do I , or even you , care why ? Daxus has offered us a most tempting proposal . One that would finally even the odds for us . So just walk away , V. Walk away . Are you insane ? You won 't drop him . You need him more than I do . End her . What did they put in me , Violet ? Don 't you see ? That mechanism Daxus , your father , put inside you it 's an antagonistic protein . It 's very precise . And it 's gonna shut you down , Six . It 's gonna kill you , Six . If I don 't find some way ... If I don 't find some ... I just need some time . I just need ... - Hello , Violet . - 3-D me . This is a surprise . I want you to take out whatever you put in the kid . Oh , I wish that was possible , but there is no cure for the antigen . - I don 't believe you . - Just bring him to me . The antigen dies with the boy and neither of them are any good to anybody . You said you were his father , for God 's sake . No , Violet . I don 't have a father . No , more precisely he 's my clone . Number six in a series of eight . What the hell difference does it make ? He 's a child , you monster . Monster ? And what are you ? And more importantly , what does that make him to you ? Some sort of bizarre , maternal surrogate ? A vampire and a dying human child . What a pathetic picture . I 'll make you another , Violet . One that 's not broken . You won 't even be able to tell the difference . I promise . And I may even be able to help you with that problem in your own blood . - Trace . - Why track the call ? I 'll tell you where I am . I want you to bring me the boy . I 'll bring you a lot more than that , you prick . I have 700 soldiers here with me . What do you really think you could do against that many men ? I can kill them . Archministry . Let 's go meet your maker . Auto-guide on . You can 't make it in . Thanks for the vote of confidence . Haven 't you been paying attention ? Killing is what I do . It 's what I 'm good at . I am a titan . A monolith . Nothing can stop me . I can see it . What the hell choice do I have ? A very clear one . To watch me die . Or make me watch you do the same . - Are you mental ? - The antidote . I told you , there is no cure . You wouldn 't create an antigen without an antidote you could administer to yourself and your manciples . Very nice , Violet . Well , yes , there is an antidote . And , yes , when I get the boy I isolate the antigen and release it into the atmosphere . Anyone who wants to live will queue up daily at this door to get it . I thought we were the ones you hated . I thought we were the ones you were trying to wipe out . That 's the problem . You were . Past tense . But now that you and those like you are all but extinct what 's someone like me ... Someone with a job to do . - going to use to keep order in a society that , left to itself , would sprint toward chaos like an Olympic event ? We did our job too well . Now , must we make amends . You disgust me . It 's a relative term , Violet . Give me what I want . Come and get it . You won 't have him . Projection disruption . There 's just too many , V. Just too many . Six . - Violet . - I 'm here . I 'm here . What 's that sound , V ? V , what 's that sound ? It 's just the wind . It 's just the wind . Too late . He 's gone . Quarantine the corpse . Get it to the Archministry . Maybe we can salvage something out of it . And her , sir ? Have an incendiary team sanitize the area immediately . - All personnel , clear the area . - Get the body on ice . Prepare it for disassembly . - We 'll go in for salvage at daybreak . - Yes , doctor . All personnel , clear the area immediately . Violet . Violet . Violet . Violet . Garth ? We very thoughtfully subbed in for the incendiary team . Your heart stopped three times but after four hours of surgery and a lot of prayer we managed to save your life . You what ? Careful . I was there , Garth . I was there . You brought me back ? For what ? So I could do it all over again ? Why ? Why ? Isn 't it ? Isn 't it obvious ? Why won 't you ever let anyone in ? Because these moments as beautiful as they are they 're evil when they 're gone . Has the third act begun yet ? It 's just about to . It 's just about to . Violet . It 's me , Garth . Listen , turn on the TV . You 're all over the place . Every channel . - Just minutes ago ... - Listen to me . I know you 're in a bad place . But what the boy wrote down on that piece of paper it has something to do with the HGV virus . I know it . I can feel it . Violet , if you could just give me a little more time . V , are you listening ? A number of helicopters were also spotted at the scene ... - Where are you ? - Outer 10th Artery . Westbound . Stay on course . I 'll converge in 15 . Archministry on approach . You can 't get in there . It 's impossible . Why do you think we had you intercept the case before it got back to Archministry ? - I 'm aware of that . What 's the point ? Retribution ? - The boy is dead . - He 's not dead . - What do you mean ? - Weapons capacity reached . I mean Six is alive . Violet , how can he be alive ? Look , what the boy wrote down on the paper it 's the chemical foundation of what I 'm certain is a cure for hemoglophagia . Daxus ' researchers probably developed it in the same lab that he was bred in . Just give me a little time . I can cure you . I know it . The antigen can 't survive without a living host . However , we may be able to salvage some viable basic protein analogs that will save us time in re-culturing the antigen in another clone . Searching for concealed weapons . Number of weapons found : many . I 'm here to see the vice-cardinal . Yellow alert ! Yellow alert ! Yellow alert ! Yellow alert ! Yellow alert ! Yellow alert ! Yellow alert ! - It 's ... It 's her . - She 's dead . Oh , my God . Single female intruder identified at Security Portal One . Please remain calm . Pacification and neutralization is underway . The boy 's dead . This is pure suicide . Yellow alert upgraded . Orange alert . One woman against 14 men ? It 's ridiculous . Have the Gas Guard waiting for her in the library . - I 'm going to level her . - Orange alert . How much weaponry does she have left ? Based on the scans taken from the security portal plenty . Okay . Red alert . Red alert . Red alert . Red alert . You are all gonna die . Is that all you 've got ? Violet , the boy is dead . You obviously don 't have a clear grasp of what dead really is . Allow me to demonstrate . For God 's sakes . Violet , I 'm unarmed . Not yet , you 're not . No . You got Hemo blood on me . It is on . Yeah , it is . Yes , no doubt , in a fair fight you would beat me . But that 's not how I got where I am today . Can you see me , Violet ? No ? Too bad you converted with only mild light sensitivity . Unlike me . - What ? - That 's right , Violet . How do you think a lowly lab technician made that meteoric rise through the ranks ? What accident of providence do you think gave him those additional qualities ? Yes , Violet I 'm like you . My God . With the minor exception that I 'm going to walk out of here alive . Violet ? Violet . Do you believe in God , Violet ? Do you hope he 's merciful ? Do you think he 'll welcome you into his arms like the so very many you 've sent his way ? Hey , Daxus . You know , after this , I think he will . Six . Six , wake up . Violet ? But I thought I was dead . No . You 've just been reborn . Violet ? Violet . Violet . - It 's okay . - No , it 's not . Violet , listen to me . There 's a cure . I know . I 've found it . Come on . Yes , I was born into a world you might not understand but a world , as it turns out where hope still lives . And my body ? Would Garth be able to fix it the way another had cured my soul ? Maybe , maybe not . But this I do know : All those still out there who spread oppression injustice and hatred they better hope not .

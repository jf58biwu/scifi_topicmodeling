What are you talking about ? What man ? The guy with the horn-rimmed glasses . Wait , it 's the warehouse near the train yard . You will find your paintings there . I saw you , hiro .

They 've given me a partner . That 's just standard protocol . It isn 'T.She 's here to watch every move I make . They don 't trust me . My family is in danger . So that makes me expendable ? We were supposed to take the company down together , but you- - I don 't know what your agenda is anymore . Dr. Suresh . I have to go . Bob needs to see us . I get it . You don 't want a partner .

Did U have breakfast yet ? Just woke up . from West : What R U having ? Smells like waffles . Chapter Seven " OUT OF TIME " Mom , did you make waffles ? Nope.West did . I wanted to bring you breakfast . I hope you don 't mind . Why would she mind ? Uh , because he wasn 't invited , and some people think that 's rude ? Nonsense . Your dad and I love meeting your friends . Will Mr.Butler be joining us ? Sadly , no . His business trip was extended . Something about ... something i wasn 't paying any attention to . Lyle , get your butt out of bed ! He 's adorable . Why would you come here when I told you not to ? I had to show you something . Check it out . We 're infamous . Drunk cheerleader suspended . Claims that she saw a boy fly . What are we gonna do ? People are gonna know it was us . How ? It 's a blurb . On the last page of the local flavor section . - It 's no big . - It is big . You can 't just do whatever you want whenever you want . I just wanna be a part of your life . Okay . But just for waffles . How do you know your father 's coming to kill b ? Isn 't this all a bit reactionary ? No.Matt 's right . Security just found his car ditched off the road maury could be here right now . I 'm taking you into protective custody . My first priority 's to keep you safe . You can 'T . You couldn 't keep angela petrelli safe . She almost killed herself on your watch . No , we stop maury here now . You realize that makes you the bait . We all have our roles to play . That 's what linderman used to say . My mother too . It 's always these half-truths . No straight answers . Constant manipulation . I 'm trying to help everyone here . How , bob ? What the hell did you people do ? Why is maury coming here to kill you ? Now is not the time to recount the past . But to focus on the task at hand . All right ! Fine , so we stay here . How do we stop my father ? Dr.Suresh , I need you and niki to inject maury with the virus . Virus ? What virus ? The virus takes away abilities . It 's also potentially lethal . - You said we 'd never use it again . - Circumstances have changed . I will not knowingly spread this virus . Maury is a killer . He knows your thoughts , your nightmares , and he could turn your world inside out . We take away his abilities , and then you can cure him with the antibodies in your blood . No one dies here today . He 's not gonna exactly volunteer for a shot . I can be persuasive . I appreciate the thought . But this one goes to you , matt . What ? Me ? All I can do is read minds . - No , no , no . You have the same abilities as maury has . Anything the brain controls , - you control . / N-No . - Senses , actions , thoughts- - - no ! No , I can 'T . I-I- - I can 't do any of that stuff . Well , then you better learn fast because you 're the only one who could stop your father . I should never have forged those guns . White Beard will conquer Japan . It is all my fault . We are not finished yet . They always underestimate women . Their folly . I am a sword-smith 's daughter ... HIRO ... HIRO ... You must concentrate ! You have to get us out of here . Why is everything so purple ? Get back to your post . White Beard doesn 't tolerate laziness . Please ... Please . Please ... Please . Caitlin ! Caitlin ! Caitlin ! Caitlin ! Peter petrelli ? According to these files , - you 're a dead man . - What ? I got your death certificate right here . So ... you 're gonna have to explain to me , how 's a dead man walk around new york city - with no sign of infection ? - Infection ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Where 's caitlin ? I need to see her . She 's from ireland . All foreigners are deported . You can 't do that ! Who the hell are you people ? What 's going on here ? You really don 't know . On march 20th , 2007 the first case was reported . After that the shanti virus spread across the globe . A pandemic . It 's killed 93 % of the world 's population to date . The rest of us live in quarantine praying to find a cure . This can 't be happening . I wish it wasn 'T . All these people died from the virus ? Yeah , it 's been a tough week . I 'm supposed to be out hunting down maury , but I needed to see you . I never should have asked you to use your ... ability to find my dad . You were just tryin 'to make me happy . I know that feeling . When my dad left I ... I blamed myself.I thought that I was ... too slow ... too ... fat . Too stupid . I thought that if I was ... better , or if I was smarter , he woulda stayed . And now they want me- - they think that I can stop him , that I 've got this power . And I don 'T . I don 'T . I need you to hear . I need you to know that I love you . Did you just hear me ? molly ? I love you , molly . What 's left of the virus is in the lab . Each syringe contains only one dose , so use it wisely . You don 't trust bob , do you ? Did he put you up to this ? I put me up to this . I wanna hear your side . Bob is morally gray at best . And the virus ? He 's toying with a death sentence . You have the cure . No one dies . Just because he 's a safety net doesn 't make it ethical . So you would make a different choice ? Morally un-gray ? I killed a lot of people ... brutally ripped them in half . They could have given me the virus , but they didn 'T . They 've made me right , so that I could have a life . Go home to my son . You 're never gonna have a life . You 're not cured . You 're a killer . And before this day is over you 're gonna kill everyone . niki ? Go on . Tell him what you 're seeing . He 'll think you 've gone crazy again . And then you 'll never see micah . Is everything all right ? Let 's go . I know these other families . Linderman , nakamura , pratt , deveaux . Everyone who 's been killed . But I don 't know this one . Who is he ? Who 's adam monroe ? Adam is ... .. complicated . So un-complicate it . Adam convinced us that we belonged together . That we could make the world a better place for our childrenjarfar for you . Snow falls on miami . I don 't get it . That headline could have read " tsunami wipes out eastern seaboard . What does any of this have to do with the murders ? Adam is the one who 's trying to kill us . - I thought maury parkman was- - - maury 's the weapon . He 's the blunt instrument . Adam was the visionary . But with these abilities , sometimes people tend to think of themselves as gods . Did you ever think that , nathan ? Adam did . And he began to talk about holocausts , plagues . Punishing humanity in order to save the world . Sounds a lot like linderman . Linderman was adam 's disciple . Adam was dangerous . So we locked him up . We threw away the key . Two weeks ago he escapes . And now he wants revenge . It sounds like you 're reaping what you sow . Why should I care ? Because of peter . Listen , pal , you wanna talk about my brother , you better be very careful what you say next . Peter is alive , nathan . Your brother is alive . I 'll leave you two alone . Do I know you ? They brought me here to help you , peter . You need to remember who you are . I need to find caitlin . You need to focus . You can move objects with your mind , heal , you can paint the future . How do you know about that ? You absorb abilities from other people . You are the most powerful of us all . You 're a kind and caring soul . Selfless.Always thinking about others . But now you need to think about yourself and fly into the face of danger . Just like your brother . I have a brother . He died in the first outbreak . But you- - you can change that . How ? I was in montreal in 2007 . The next thing I know , I 'm here . You met a man named hiro nakamura . He can travel in time . So can you . You can change history . - I can 'T . - You must ! I can 't control these things that are happening to me ! Then this virus will kill us all . Peter , you need to remember . You need to remember . Mom ? Do the marks hurt ? No . They 're kinda just there . Painless souvenirs of my alien abduction from the guy with horn-rimmed glasses . If you 're gonna be dropping in , there 's something I need to tell you . I get it . Get what ? I 'm moving too fast . We don 't have to go any further if you don 't want to . You know what I want ? Popsicles . Popsicles . Awesome . Raspberry or blue ? He found us . Who ? The man who abducted me.We 've gotta get outta here . Come on . No , wait.That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . The guy in the glasses is my father . What is this ? Some sort of trap ? No , just listen to me . Back off . Wait . claire ! Who are you talkin ' to ? No one . You 've got two popsicles . Welcome home . There is nothing you can do now . We lost.White Beard has won . We must go on while we still can . I can not . White Beard 's army is preparing to march . But how ? Even with your abillity , what can you do against an army ... Destory their guns . Without them White Beard is nothing . And what about Kensei ? You cannot wtop him . Nothing can . His heart is broken . Pain has made him cruel.But , he is good inside . You would risk your life for your faith in him ? It won 't be safe for you here . Meet me under the cherry blossoms . Wait for me . all this trouble over one drop of liquid . This virus could kill an entire species . Or it could stop maury and save our lives . Poor niki . So vulnerable . You 're perfect.Show me your nightmares . Show me your thoughts.Show me your soul . How do I turn you into a killer ? Nothing 's going to save you . This company is bad . You 're not making up for your son ' S. You 're diggin ' deeper into hell , and worse , you 're gonna drag micah right down with you . You 're wrong . They said that they would help me . Niki , what are you talkin ' about ? I was sick . I 'm still sick . How can you say that ? Because you 're dead . No , I 'm not . They don 't want me talkin ' to you . They 're using you , nik . Just like linderman.Just like jessica . You can still do the right thing . You have to kill him . That 's the only way you can save micah . Niki , you 're talking to yourself . I think it 's maury . We need to call bob . I thought you 'd come here . This many guns in japan , they will crush history . I cannot let white beard win . We can still stop this ... together . We did make a good team , you and I. You showed me how to be a hero . How to love . And then ... you took it all away . Do it , hiro . Stop time.Kill me . Cut off my head . I will not do it . I still have faith in you . The honorable hiro nakamura . He won 't kill you . He 'll just lie , cheat , and steal . I wanted to help you become a hero . I never claimed to be anything more than a happy drunk . Do not punish the world for my mistakes ! I only want to punish you , hiro . Yaeko was right . She 's not destined to be my princess . She 's destined to die . No ! Take my hand . We must get out of here now . Never ! As long as I have breath , anything you love , I will lay to waste . I swear . You will suffer . peter 's alive , nathan . This was taken three months ago right here . Is he here now ? No.He 's gone . Gone where ? What is it you 're not telling me ? I need to know everything . He was in cork , ireland , and then we lost track of him . Lost track of him ? How do you lose someone ? How do you lose someone ? Dad ! Matt ! Molly . What are you doing in here ? Where are we ? This is where he keeps me . What ? When I tried to find your dad , he locked me in here . Now we 're both trapped . No . No , we 're not . Dad ! Matt ? Did you bring me here ? I think ... I think I did . Step back , nathan.I got it . Don 't do it , niki.This isn 't you . - Don 't do it . - How can you defend him ? He killed D.L. I didn 't kill anyone.It 's maury . He 's gotten inside of your head . Listen to me , this is a nightmare.This isn 't you . Don 't be his puppet ! You 're stronger than this . You came here to get control of your life . Don 't let maury undo all of that . Listen to me.Listen to me . Think of your son.Think of micah . Think of your boy . I couldn 't get the nightmare out . I didn 't know what else to do . I had to stop myself . Matt . Don 't be scared , molly.We 're gonna get out of here . Do you recognize this room ? Yeah , of course.This is our old placeon parthenia . Brisket and potatoes.This is the night you left . I never apologized . You weren 't sorry.You walked out that door , you never even turned back . You think this didn 't hurt me ? This broke my heart . I love you , matt . Then turn yourself in . That 's not gonna happen . - There 's no prison that can hold me . - I think there is ! I think I can trap you in here just like you trapped molly . - How are you gonna do that ? - Look around , pop . This isn 't my nightmare ! This is yours ! - I can walk right out that door . - No , you can 'T . You can 't ! Because you 're not strong enough ! Because you 're still that scared little boy ! No ! I 'm not scared of you anymore ! I 'm a good man ! I 'm a good cop ! I 'm a good father , which is something you know nothing about . You don 't know what it 's like to fight for someone that you love . You left . You left . All you haveare your nightmares . Let 's get out of here . Don 't leave me . Don 't leave me alone ! No ! Matt ? Oh , god . Molly , the nightmare 's over . He 's never gonna hurt you again . Ever.I promise . Oh , god , I love you . I heard . so what happens next ? Where do all these people go ?

He was my friend I betrayed him I killed Takezo kensei Everything Kensei accomplished ... . You did all these things.Not him . As sure as I live , you are Takezo Kensei Perhaps now you can live happily with his Princess . There 's not how the story ends . It is the last trial . " Kensei and the Dragon . " My father told it to me . The dragon who taught Kensei the way of the sword ... Demanded his love in return What did Kensei do ? He cut out his own heart to save her . To save japan . Is that what you must do now ? Cut out your heart ? I nearly destroyed time by staying when I should have left I must go back As long as I have a voice , all shall know the story Of noble Takezo Kensei . The boy Hiro Nakamura will have tales to help him sleep . And he will dream of the Princess Farewell . The antibodies in my blood will eradicate any traces of the virus in your system . Your nose , Does it hurt ? Only when I breathe . I 'm sorry . It 's not your fault . You weren 't in control . This can 't be right . What 's wrong ? The antibodies aren 't working.This isn 't possible.Not now . It 's another strain of the virus . It 's immune.My blood 's no longer a cure . I 'm going to die ? I had to get you a souvenir Hiro !

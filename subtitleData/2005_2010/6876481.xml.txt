Without even the courtesy of a reach around . It 's been a business doing pleasure with you , my friend . Who 's next ? Come on , girls , don 't be shy . What about you , sugar ? Hope you have some change in your pocket for a metrocard . Come on . You two girls have fun , now . I 'm gonna go find me some respect somewhere else . Come on . See you . Hit the timer . Well , that sucked . It 's game over . Forget it . Harry Jellenik . Alex Borden . You okay ? Yeah , yeah . It 's a migraine , i guess . Well , you keep at it , young Alex . Good-bye , Alex . Hey ! Don 't do that ! Why do you do that ? My dream . It tried to get me in my dream . I hurt him so he 's too weak to come after us . You 've seen them , too ? I don 't want to talk about it . Okay ? If dad finds out this is happening again , he 'll send us away from each other . Do you want that to happen ? Huh ? Thought so . Then keep your mouth shut . Promise ? Promise . We need to stick together . Okay ? As long as I 'm here , I won 't let anything happen to you , Alex . HELLOOO ? Alex . Jason ? How did you get in ? Your door is wide open . I thought somebody broke in . I expected to find some lunatic raping your lifeless corpse . Yes . Yeah . That would be what you 'd think . What are you doing here ? This is where I live . No . This is where you house-sit . I brought these back . Stacy 's in the car . Smoke ? No ? ... ' Course not . What 's that ? It 's " secrets of modern chess strategy advances since NIMZOWITSCH . " You hate chess . I know . So ... ? So , I don 't know . Something like , something like happened today . I got home and I 'm flipping through every book in the house . And , here ... Take this one . This is a real page Turner . I read it an hour ago . You finished it an hour ago ? No , no . I read it an hour ago . Yeah ... Yikes ! When do the Klausners get back ? In the fall . Who vacations in Rwanda ? I don 't know , but it beats unemployment . Would you stop touching the things , please ? I don 't think you can call house-sitting employment . Alex , with a brain like yours , you should have a job with NASA or , you know , one of those companies that hires really smart people . Yeah . Headache ? Yeah , it 's ... Do me a favor . Lay off the speed reading . I gotta go . Stacy 's waiting . I 'll see you later , okay ? Alex ? Oh , god . Alex ? Wake up , man . Alex ! Alex ! Ira , right now , medically , he 's fine . The curvature is completely unbroken , inside and out . Look , if I 'm reading this correctly , this kid uses more of his frontal lobe for cognitive activity than anybody who has ever been charted . You can 't release him , sweetheart . No , this chart alone is worth tens of thousands in study grants . What choice do I have ? I have no basis for keeping him . I suppose a postmortem analysis is out of the question . Is that supposed to be funny , ira ? Hey , buddy , what you got there ? My head is killing me . Well , that 's inaccurate and quite impossible . What I don 't doubt is that you 've had a mild to mildly severe head trauma . So what I need to do is give you a cognitive assessment . Then I 'll poke a few holes in your skull . Holes ? Metaphorically speaking , of course . We 'll start off with the easy first test . Okay ? Okay . Okay . Look very carefully at this chart . Try to remember as much as you can about what you see . Alright . How many of the pictures can you remember ? In alphabetical order - apple , ball , cat , dog , egg , fire truck , grasshopper , hat , ice cream cone , jump rope , kangaroo , light bulb ... Well , that 's fine . What was that ? Why don 't you tell me ? Calculate the following-a plane flying the 3,458 mile distance from New York City to London has a 50-mile-an-hour tail wind . The plane 's point of no return is 1,489 miles . Give or take a hundred yards . I didn 't even finish the question . Well , in layman 's terms ... You 're getting smarter . The part of your brain that you use for cognition , it 's just off the charts . When we ran the test , it showed your brain 's activity . Other than the blackouts , you seem to be in perfect health . None of this solves my problem . What if it happens again ? Do you have any idea what you could do , if you harnessed even a fraction of your intellectual potential ? Do I even care about that right now ? God , you sound like that geeky friend of yours , Doctor , uh ... Dr. Gold . Yeah . You know , and i don 't like his idea of " postmortem analysis . " It 's not that kind of hospital . Don 't tell me the thought didn 't cross his mind . I heard him . You heard him during the scan ? I heard a lot of stuff . Alex . Look , it 's a long shot , but I have a colleague who 's doing some research that might help you . It 's worth a try . Right now , I might try anything . I think this is the place . Hey , we 'll keep you in our prayers . Okay ? Hey , you want us to wait for you ? No , than ks . It 's alright . Sure ? Yeah . Take care of yourself . God bless . God bless . Alex Borden ? I 'm Dr. Murphy . I don 't know how much Denise - Dr. bell-has told you about my book . She just said that i should see you . She must have told you i don 't have insurance . It 's not about money . You let me document your progress with these sessions , anonymously , of course , and I 'll treat you free of charge . What 's this book you 're writing ? It 's a study of people who , in simple terms , have found the switch that turns on the dormant portions of their brains . We 're documenting the ways in which it affects them . Migraines , night terrors , spontaneous knowledge , visions ... Some people even swear they hear voices . Well , some people are crazy . Do th ese symptoms sound familiar to you ? Can you help me or not ? Alex , if even half of what Denise has told me about you is accurate , you 're unlike anyone I 've ever studied . Your case would take priority . Just promise , you 'll make the pain go away . Whatever it takes , i promise I 'll try . I 've been doing it ever since i was a little kid , I guess . Lie down , focus on a point above ... Clear my head of all the stuff crashing around inside . And I just ... Go somewhere . It 's all I ever wanted , was to go away . And I found out how to do it . Why didn 't you tell anyone back then ? Who could I trust besides my brother ? And that 'll do it for me today , gentlemen . One more game ? I 'll make it quick and painless for you . Is that right ? Hey ! I 've been waiting almost two hours to win my money back . Wait your turn , kid . And what makes you think today is going to be any different ? Bitch . Harry ! You really want that game , huh ? How ... how do you live with these ? You paint what you know . So ... people , like ... Buy these things ? Beer ? Yeah . You gonna stand there all day ? Or are we gonna play some chess ? I don 't usually have strangers up in my studio . Hit the timer . You know you 're never gonna beat me . I 'll beat you . Maybe not today , but I will beat you . That 's mate . Oh ! That really , really sucks . You know , in the future , you may want to consider castling your king , because it tends to prolong the game . Yeah . What are those for ? My nutritionist told me they thought they 'd put hair on my chest . And , uh ... what do you think about that ? I think he 's full of shit . Have a good day . Okay ... Oh ... sorry . I come back . That 's al-it 's okay , it 's okay . Go ahead . Thank you . Okay . Jason ! Stacy ! You there ? Dr. Ira Gold was found mutilated . In our last session you mentioned that something strange happened in the ambulance on the way to the hospital . You want to tell me about it ? It 's hard to explain . I remember them , like , trying to save me . I was out cold , but I could hear them . And somehow ... See them . I could smell what Charlie had eaten for lunch . Charlie ? The ems guy . I don 't know how I know that , but I know that 's his name . Go on . I could see Alice ... The ambulance driver , behind CHARLIE 'S back . She kept a bag of weed under the passenger seat for when things on the shift got intense . Isn 't it possible that because of your accident , just maybe ... What ? I dreamed it ? No . Call the hospital if you want , ask what their names were . Or , better yet , go down there , roll a joint . Maybe share some with Dr. gold . Oh , wait , he 's dead . Tell me when to stop . Tell me when to stop . Stop . Ask me what 's in the book . Go ahead . Ask me . " A survey of 702 clubs found - " " that almost 70 % met in saloons or neighborhood halls that sold liquor . " Ask me another one . Jesus . Well , look who the wind blew in . You had to come looking for him , didn 't you ? Free country . Next time you want to play Harry , you go through us . Where is he ? He 's probably home counting his money . He 's probably at the empire luncheonette on Avenue b . Thanks . Believe me ... You 're not welcome . You can play us next time . Deal . Ooh ! What else have you been doing with that hand ? Ah , chess is good . What shall we eat tonight ? Hmm , where are you taking Sammy ? Someone did well for himself today . You could , too . If you 'd stop drinking all your profits . Hmm , yeah . Fuck you ! You know I 'd be out of sorts without my , ah , medicine . Your medicine . Right . Ah , it won 't take me but a moment . Do you mind if we , ah ... Stop off at the bath room ? You have to pee again ? How ever did you guess ? Sure . I hate it when that happens ! Lloyd ? You made me piss myself ! I 'm gonna slap you so hard ! Lloyd ? OHHH ! Please ! Hey , Sammy ! What you doing in there ? Sammy ? Shit . Now I gotta go . Tanked after only a few drinks . Are you sure it isn 't something you ate ? Or maybe someone ? Okay . So it ain 't funny . You aren 't still mad at me , are you ? I mean about the money . Come on , Sammy . I won that fair and square . That 's the way it 's done . Sammy ? Sammy ? Sammy ? You could have stayed here if you needed a place to sleep . What did this ... This beast do ? My god ! Alex , you ... You wouldn 't hurt yourself , would you ? Fuck you ! Alex ! Wait ! You came to me for help , but I can only help you if you 're honest with me . I never lied to you . Never . The police have been met with another grizzly surprise , in the predawn darkness . This time on the upper West Side . Connie Sanchez has the latest . Connie ? That 's right , Brian . Detectives have no leads yet in a double homicide that shattered this quiet West Side neighborhood late last night . New York residents Lloyd Carter and Sammy chung were found brutally stabbed directly behind me , in a public restroom , right here at the 79th street boat basin . Their bodies found shortly before sunrise by a maintenance man . You know , we , we , we came , you know , and all of a sudden , there was cops all over the place ... I killed them . I killed them . Alex , you didn 't kill anybody . Things from my dreams ... They 're not in my dreams anymore . You know , we 've had our ups and downs with bums ... Alex ! Leave me alone . It 's Alex , man . It 's not a good time . It 's important , man . I gotta see you . Are you okay ? Two good friends are dead . How do you think I am ? Sit down . How much have you had to drink ? You came here to play chess , didn 't you ? So let 's play . Maybe ... maybe when you feel better . Better ? I haven 't felt better . And I haven 't played better now that I stopped taking this shit ! Check ! And check-fucking-mate ! Okay . Okay , we 'll play ! Just ... It 's not every day your friends get butchered by some beast . What did you just say ? Nothing . Something I heard on the news . I have something to tell you . I have something to tell you . White moves first . So , seeing that you 're white ... I do believe that pleasure is all yours . You know ... Ev , ev , ev , ever since Nimzowitsch developed the , the flexible dynamic approach to the queen 's pawn , the chess world has been polarized as to what white 's response should be . I would put the rubinstein variation into play . Good for you . A little late for the catalan opening . You need to focus on your middle game . Who 's been whispering into your ears ? You don 't want to know . See ? Never underestimate the Cambridge Springs defense . That 's what Karpov did . That 's how Kasparov kicked his ass in ' 85 . Check . Well , we 'll see about that . Check . Mate . The Borden sacrifice . I haven 't lost a chess game in almost three years . So , here 's to the Rubinstein variation . And the Borden sacrifice . You gonna , you gonna be okay ? I told you . Never better . Here , drink up ! Uh ... thanks . I 'll , I 'll pass . Do you want to play like a man ? You drink like a man . Tell me about your paintings . You wanna play another - Tell me about your fucking paintings ! Do you really want to know what I know ? ! I scare you , don 't I ? ! We play ! Again ! I can 't emphasize this enough . It 's a very serious matter . Giving up your rights as legal guardian of the children is permanent . Irrevocable . Once I place them in a foster home , the new parents can adopt the children . They can change their names , and even move out of state . And once that happens , it 's next to impossible to get them back . I urge you to think it over . I don 't need more time to think . I want you to take th em now . The sooner , the better . I have the papers here . If you 'll take them and ... Read th em over . It 's done . Oh ... and there 's another thing . I want you to listen to me very carefully . What the fuck ! Whoa , whoa . What 's the matter with you , man ? Don 't do that . Okay , sorry . The other night , there were reports of a peeper . A what ? A fucking peeper . I thought you might be the perv . Can I come in ? Okay . Sure . Things from hell are after me . I know that sounds , that sounds , whatever . But , I ... I can 't call the doctors because they 'll put me in a straightjacket . I can 't ... I can 't sleep because there 's like a fucking monster in my closet . And I have this headache . Because I know things , I know , i know a million things , that I , I have no idea how I know them . I 'm mastering the game of chess ... I 'm reading cervantes . I know these things . I know you guys fucked an hour ago . Your brother doesn 't know that you talked your father into changing his will . What the fuck are you talking about ? And you . You say that ... You say that you 're true to Jason . But when you wanted a raise at work , you flashed your supervisor your tits . Jason , that 's not true . Yes , it is . You even let him feel you up . Okay . You need to leave . Now . Okay . Yeah . I didn 't think you could help me . Is there anything I can do for you , son ? I 'm ... I 'm Alex . Reverend Hartman . You look lost . You know , you 're not the first young man with a dazed expression ... Who wanders in here in dead of night . There are things that are after me . Hurting people around me . Who is after you ? Things you find in shadows . They 're not pretty . They 're never pretty . When do you see them ? Night , mostly . Welcome to the club . What else , Alex ? I , ah , I see things and i see these memories of my past that never happened to me . Or at least i don 't think so . It sounds like you 're really in big trouble , Alex . So what do we do ? You 're sure you want to be helped ? Yes . That 's all I want . Yes . I 'll be right back . Our substance independence group meets every Tuesday and Thursday evening . It 's very discreet . No one has to know . Lam ... I am not an addict ! What I 'm telling you is real ! People are dying ! Really ? You believe that ? Yes . That 's what I keep trying to tell you . Why doesn 't anyone believe me ? I believe you , Alex . But , important is , what you believe . I don 't know what to believe anymore . I don 't know who to believe . That is why I 'm here . So you say you 're plagued by evil . Yes . More and more . Evil , Alex , is merely the absence of good . As for me , it 's the proof of good , the test of good . There are two opposing forces , locked in mortal combat fighting for eternity . What are they fighting for ? What are they fighting for ? They 're fighting for you , Alex . For your intellect , humanity , what you might call your soul . You know , you have to be very careful . The devil can be a very tricky one . So , what do i do ? I pray ? Here . Alex . A good start . Oh , my god . You 're bleeding . You 're bleeding . We have to leave here right now . Leave ? Why ? Listen to me ! You have to leave here right now or you 're going to die . Why leave ? Alex ! We are already here , Alex ! Alex , my son . What 's happened to you ? You okay ? Alex , you had nothing to do with those murders . You can 't blame yourself for what happens around you . You can only be responsible for yourself . Bull fucking shit ! My brain is growing . I wish I didn 't have to do this , because I don 't think it 's in your best interest . But maybe you need to hear it from someone else . Then you 'll believe me . What is this ? I know someone who wrote an article for the " annals of abnormal psychology . " He used to be a rather respected metaphysician . Over time , his theories began to get Wilder and Wilder . Towards the end , we thought they were pure fantasy . He was finally blacklisted by most conventional practitioners . How is this going to help me ? By proving to you once and for all what you aren 't . Yes ? Um , Dr. Karen Murphy sent me . You know . You are seeing them ? You believe me ? Believe ? Is not empirical term , please , do come in , quickly ! They have finally come true . Yes ? I ... I don 't , I don 't - killings are happening all around you , violent killings of much blood , much suffering . Yes ? I am Pavlovsky . Boris Pavlovsky .

Who can say ? They are not from this plane of existence . But only people like you , " links " you can see them . What do they want ? I 'm not sure . No one has ever survived an encounter . Link I studied is dead . If they 're so powerful , then why haven 't they killed me already ? They are scared of your power . I , I don 't have any power . Ah , but you do . But they never stop . Never sleep . Where you go , they smell you on other people . Everything you touch , everyone you touch - that is how they are following you . Yeah , but ... It 's me . It 's my fault . Is not fault . Is destiny . Yours . The gloves . The gloves . That 's why you wouldn 't shake my hands . Even now , I am in danger with you in my house . There are others like me ? Once were plenty . Now , no more . At institute ... Soviet institute of metaphysical science , we study many links . Isolate th em . Tap into brains . Learn that they use part of brain other humans cannot . Know things other humans do not . One link is like genius . Two links , three links together , like weapon . Psychic laser . Make the ministry of defense very happy . I ... I 'm going to throw up . Other link ... One who is giving you power ... Is who ? I , I don 't , I don 't know , i , I don 't know who that ... Visions are new to you ? Link is someone you are recently meeting . That is when visions are growing strongest . Yes . Yes . Oh , yes . I know who it is . What can we do to stop this ? Tell me what that means ! You 'll know soon enough . Look what you did . You brought evil into this house ! Evil has many faces . Evil ! Come on , hey ... We 're gonna play a game , we 're gonna , we 're gonna play a game . We 're gonna play a game . Come get me . We 're gonna play a game . We 're gonna , we 're gonna play . Play ... play ... Look , it 's not you . Stop . Stay back ! You leave us alone . Don 't do this ! Now ! We have to stick together , okay ? As long as I 'm here , I won 't let anything happen to you , Alex . Giving up your rights of the children is permanent . My dream , they tried to get me in my dream . You 've seen them , too ? I 've got you . I got ... I got you ! Harry Jellenik . Alex Borden . Wanna play a game ? Let 's play a game . I got you ! I got you ! Harry ? I want you to listen to me very carefully . Whatever you do , you keep these boys apart . Separate . Do not place them in the same home . But it 's customary - I don 't care . I know what 's best for them and the people around them . Do you understand ? I got you ! I got you ! What the hell is going on ? You know what time it is ? Jesus Christ ! You have to get out of here . Slow down . Listen to me . You have to get out of here . Alex , you 're scaring me . What is it , man ? It 's them . It 's them . Who the fuck is them ? Alex ?

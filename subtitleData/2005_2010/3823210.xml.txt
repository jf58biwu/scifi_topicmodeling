 You don 't have to look , you know . - I - I 'm fine . Just do it . - It 's nothing to be ashamed of . A lot of people have trouble with blood . Can we not make a big deal about it and just get it done ? All right , make a fist . At home , going to a doctor can be a little scary . But there are special challenges to medical care ... - in the microgravity of space . - Come on . Oh , for instance , fluid handling can be very difficult . Right , Dr. Mintz ? Can you explain this process to the fleet back on Earth ? It 's just a routine blood test , Paula . - Needle in , needle out . - Well , we all know ... there is nothing routine about space . - Damn it . Missed . - Mmm . - Okay , Paula . Enough . - Yeah . Do they have you do this just to piss us off ? I 'm the payload specialist . I 'm the pilot of the Venus lander . And I 've also been chosen ... to document this voyage for classrooms across the world . - And it 's my job , okay ? - All right . Well , right now , your job and my job seem to be in conflict . So why don 't we try this another time ? - Fine . - Thank you . Another time then . Mintz once told me he couldn 't remember ... a single person he saved when he was a surgeon . He could recall cases , diseases , wounds - Almost done . But he forgot the people . - You can look now . - When I asked him why , he said it was simple . There are no lessons to learn from the ones you save . No reason to remember . Keep your hand there . Lessons are taught by the ones you lose . All right , listen up . This is not a blow-off day . It 's not a field trip . - Welcome . - Sorry . Traumatic injury and illness happens . Happens here . Happens in space - With one major difference . Wassenfelder , what 's the major difference ? - Um , it - - That 's what I thought . - Wake up , genius . - What 's the difference , Dr. Mintz ? On Earth you gate 911 . - Whereas on Antares - - We only have each other to rely on . And if you can 't rely on each other - What happens , Dr. Winkler ? - You die . - That 's right . You die . Dr. Winkler 's obviously been hitting the doughnut cart lately . Yeah , anything to keep the baby happy . But at one time , she was a member of the illustrious Ostriches ... which means an ASCAN classmate of mine and a very , very , very good one . She 's running the E.R. Here at Koop now ... and has agreed to be our chaperone for the day . All right , I want you to form three groups in front of the doctors here - Dr. Mintz , Dr. Winkler and Dr. Dereux . Let 's go . Fall in . - You ASCAN 'd with Donner , huh ? - Yeah . - Yeah , and homeboy hurls at the sight of blood . - No kidding ? Oh , yeah . Class of ' 42 , baby . The only question is , how long before he goes down ? Ah , I got 20 says he doesn 't make it past lunch . Yeah . He 'll be lucky to make it to 11 : 00 . - You in ? - All right . Take one . Pass it back . Just one . Pass it back . Here you go . Pass those back . Take one . Pass it back . Okay ? All righty ? Let 's head out . - That wasn 't too obvious . - Think he saw ? No . You were smooth as silk . Course now , you 're with Dr. Pregnant . So , I heard you did your residency in Tel Aviv ? - Yeah . After the war . - I was at Richardson in Montreal . - To be honest , I kinda miss it . - I don 't . Okay . So we 're gonna split you guys into groups ... and assign individual cases . Uh - Oh , Dr. Mintz ... why don 't you and Donner take your group into this bay here ? It 's a little lawn mower accident . Mm-hmm . I 'm gonna go down to the lobby . Check for stragglers . Mm-hmm . Almost . - Coming down with something ? - Doctors don 't get sick . Uh-huh . Is that according to the sick doctor ? - I consult with Claire . - Oh , who 's totally objective when it comes to you , huh ? - She is a medical professional . - Hey . Ev , don 't play me . All right ? Took you six stabs to find a vein . My back 's been acting up since we left Earth orbit . I 've been getting strange reactions to the pain medication . - That causes the shakes ? - Among other things . Trying to find the right dosage . All right . Roger that . Mintz have a fever ? I didn 't see that on last night 's 0-11 . Low grade . I just noted it , Mike . Hey ! He 's back . - Ajay ! - Nice to see you . You look good . Welcome home . Thank you , Dr. Goss , for allowing my return to the floor . Welcome back , Sharma . Everyone 's very happy you 've made a full recovery . I 'm humbled . Honored to be part of the family again . Yeah , well , you just hold on to that humility when the press wants your story . - I was briefed by Eve Shaw . - " No comment " is your default setting . - You copy that ? - Yes , sir . No comment at all . Hey . - Hey . - Do you have a few ? - Could help me with something in the lab ? - Yeah . New experiment ? You could say that . - Mysterious . - Mmm . Slash cute and fuzzy . Close that hatch . Okay . This is all a little skulky . - We doing weird science ? - Mmm , nothing weird , but definitely skulky . May I present ... Rufus . Okay . Yeah , not so cute ... - or fuzzy . - Give him time . Aren 't you supposed to destroy rabbit fetuses after 10 cell divisions ? Well , yes . - Today 's his birthday , and I need your help . - What ? - Baking a cake ? - Giving him birth . This is Mr. Gerwitz . Dislocated shoulder . - These are our astronauts . - Hey . Here we go . Oh , I know . - Okay . - So you were in Donner 's class ? Yeah . Yeah , until I realized ... I 'd make a better doc than a sky walker , and I dropped out . Oh , I 'm sorry . I know it hurts . Uh , lido patch , please . You 'll have these on Antares . They 're localized lidocaine anesthetic . And they work ... that fast . It 's excellent , huh ? Okay . We 're gonna brace him . Here you go . Donner was my partner when I did my ASCAN rounds ... which meant I pretty much did them alone . - Do tell . - Oh , well , you know about the blood thing . - No . Blood thing ? - You didn 't see him run away out there ? Ooh . It 's the only thing I 've ever seen Donner wimp out on - Which is what makes it so much fun . Everyone ready ? Excellent . Okay ? Okay . I gotta pee . Little bugger 's crushing my bladder . So - People ? You know what ? Don 't let Dr. Mom there give you second thoughts . It 's too late for second thoughts . - It 's done . I took the pill this morning . - What ? Then , Zoe , you shouldn 't be here . I 'll be home before the cramping starts , and tomorrow it 'll be like it never happened . Okay . Russell Zachary . High as a kite and under police investigation . Girl , you can 't have me arrested without a positive test . You know that . I know that . So - Yeah . Apparently this is a new designer drug moving down the coast . Its , um , molecular structure is designed ... to basically disappear into your system . - Untraceable ? - Mmm . - That 's genius . - It 's not genius . It 's illegal . Okay , so check his vitals every 15 until his blood work comes back . You know , sometimes a trace shows up . Wait . I mean , is that all we could do ? Yeah , Paula . Sometimes medicine can be dull . Get over it . She 's so hot . - Do you get high , miss ? - Don 't talk to me . We are now 30 days into our voyage . A little over a week and a half from insertion into Venusian orbit . And I have the honor - You said " insertion . " I have the honor of piloting the Venus lander . - So I 'm really starting to get excited . - Insertion makes her excited . This is an amazing adventure that I feel truly blessed to be a part of . And you can be a part of it too . All you have to do is tune in . From Antares , I am Paula Morales . Until tomorrow . You are such a jerk . Why ? ' Cause I don 't say a prayer every time we near a new planet ... or blow a kiss to Christ after every Form 24 ? There 's nothing wrong with living my religion . Uh , you know , " Spectacles , testicles , wallet and watch . - Please , Father , forgive me ' " - - Lock it down , Wassenfelder . You two , come on . I have a job for you . Okay , go long . Dragon 's breath . Nice hands . You better say an end zone prayer now , Morales . I 'll say a prayer for the moron who threw the pass . - You know why he 's making us do this , right ? - Yeah . We work together , we form a friendship . Commander Ted 's sweat bonding . " If you will love only those who love you ... - what reward is there in that ? ' " - Sweat bonding through Jesus . That 's the worst . No , Matthew 5 : 46 . Why do zealots never understand irony ? Paula ! Steven ! No ! - Zoe , mask . - Seriously ? Just think of it as a sociological experiment . Bonding with pets in space . - Why invest in something when you cannot keep it ? - That 's not true . I am gonna nurse this beauty all the way back to Earth . Look at that . This is the first real birth in space . I mean , isn 't it amazing ? Looks like a tiny , floating penis with teeth . Hand me that aspirator . - What is the matter with you ? - What is the matter with me ? - What if Mission Control finds out ? - I turned off the camera . And Rollie knows . - Rollie knows . Rollie knows and he didn 't say anything ? - Not yet . - It 's against protocol , Jen . - It 's one rabbit , Zoe . Relax . - We have a man down in storage bay . - Code 3 . Code 3 . - God . Wonder who . Come on . You gotta go . - Gotta go , Jen . - Yeah , I 'll be there . I just gotta put him away . - Do we know who ? - Paula . Whoa ! It was an accident ! The-The container pinned her and the hatch door came down ! She 's got no thumb ! She 's got no thumb ! - Apply pressure , Steven ! Press down hard ! - She 's got - - Flight , we 've got a severed thumb and a - - Strong pumps . - and an additional , uh , abdominal injury . - Oh , my God . Oh , my God . That 's it , Wass . We gotta get her up to the natural grav quick . She 's losing a lot of blood . Does anybody have a 20 on Mintz ? - In his quarters . - Well , let 's get him over to the med station . Clear the floor of everyone but critical personnel . And cut the press feed . Tell them we 'll brief 'em on the half hour . Ev , they need you now . Evram . On my way . You know , being an instructor , you could probably just go home . Yeah ? And give Winkler the satisfaction ? - I saw that bet go down . - Got a sprained ankle in Bay 4 I could put you on . - Yeah ? You 'd do that ? - My money 's on you lasting the shift . Oh , heads up . G.S.W. Intubated in the field . Pulse thready . B.P. ' s dropping . G.S. W. - Haven 't had one of those in a while . - Gunshot wound . Bet they don 't have a clue . - You 're a combat medic , right ? Look , I want the sprained ankle , but if you don 't think they can handle it ... we should ride along . Let 's go . All right , come on . Bring her in . Put her on the table . Nice and easy . Good , good . Set her down . Okay , grab her feet . Nadia , you pull the stretcher out on three . One , two , three . Everybody behind the curtain . - You good ? - I said behind the curtain . I don 't need you puking on my feet . - Where the hell is Jen ? - Zoe ? She , uh - She had to close an experiment . All right , I need another assist . Nadia . Look at me . I can 't . I 'll go back and clean up the blood . Donner , you 're clean . Scrub and mask . - Huh ? - Scrub and mask . You 're not contaminated . - Claire , how 's she doing ? - B.P. ' s 80 over 50 and dropping . Heart rate 's 130 and spiking . Copy that . We 'll hold her blood pressure . Zoe , two units O Negative on the rapid infuser . How long has she been unconscious ? - Wassenfelder ! - Uh , like-Te-Ten minutes , tops . - Any brain trauma ? Did she hit her head ? - Scan 's not seeing any . No . She-Shejust fainted when she saw her thumb . All right , I 'm gonna take a look . Donner , scope . - I got it ! - No , too late . You stay outside the curtain . Donner , let 's go . Forceps and scissors . I mean , it 's , like , how can they not let you do drugs - I mean , it 's , like , how can they not let you do drugs - - Oh , man . - in space ? Don 't think I haven 't thought about that a thousand times . Oh , but they can 't even tell , you know , man ? It 's like it 's untraceable . They wouldn 't even know . - Would you stop ? - Uh-oh . - Here we go . - Just stop . You 're a ridiculous poser without a clue . - I 've watched too many of my friends - - In church ? My neighborhood back in Jersey City . Anyway , just people I grew up with . Starts out all fun and games until the inevitable O. D ... the failed rehab and the pathetic downward spiral . Is she always this much fun ? You have no idea , dude . Scope . Scope in . - What-What about her thumb ? - Forget the thumb . Priorities . - Okay , well , it 's important to her . - We can regrow it . Not in a week ! She can 't pilot a Venus lander without her thumb ! - Step out , Wass . - Hey , don 't screw her over like this ! You go help Nadia vacuum up the blood in the pod bay . Go ! I can 't see anything . Donner , I need suction . - Clear that up for me . - Yeah . Uh , suction . Coming in , um - - Oh , wow . Oh , that 's a lot of blood . - I can get it . Okay . Here we go . - Is that better ? - Much . Oh , damn . She 's got a peritoneal bleed . - Meaning what ? - We got a bloodbath . I need suction . Clear that out for me . More suction , people . Come on . Where 's my surgical consult ? - He can 't handle it . He 's gonna lose her . - Tell him . - Man , that 's bloody . - You need a visual , Doctor . - We have a visual . - No , you got a camera in soup . - You need to open up the wound . - I prefer to minimize the trauma . - I prefer to save the patient . - Her B.P. ' s still dropping . 70 over 40 . I can see that , Claire . Thank you . Evram ? Well , I can 't stop the bleed unless I find it . - What 's going on here ? - More suction , Zoe . Nothing . Are we gonna lose her ? She 'll hold as long as we keep pumping blood . Yeah , but they 'll burn through their reserves . They 'll have an on-ship blood drive , Mike . They 'll have time . And if they exhaust the supply ? Ev will have the wound closed before then . He 'll have it closed . He will . Maybe you should open it up , Ev . Find the bleed with your eyes . - You 're a surgeon now , Donner ? - You gave that advice to somebody and it worked . Right ? When is the last time you didn 't use the fiber cam ? You need to use your hands , your eyes , inside . Get him out of here before I call Security ! - What 's going on , Donner ? - Uh , I think somebody 's gonna blow a gasket . - I don 't know if it 's Mintz or the kid . - Dr. Mintz ? In wartime triage , we would 've red-tagged this kid and saved him with a sewing kit . This idiot has every technology known to man , and he 's gonna kill him . He 's in free fall . - We 're losing him . - I 'm going in . All right . My patient . - Security ! - His patient , Doctor . Give it to him . 7 blade . The scalpel with the 7 on it . Come on . Let 's go . Okay , retract and give me some suction . Open her up , Ev . - Ev . - Come on . All right , let 's open her up . Gone . 7 blade . 7 blade . Incising . Evram ? Mintz . Mintz , is there a problem ? Mintz , what is going on ? Mintz ? What are we doing , Ev ? Evram , you have to incise . You 're losing her . Ev ? - I don 't want to lose her . - Well , open her up , okay ? Forget the machines . Just use your eyes . Use your hands . She 's sliding , Ev . She 's in free fall . Ev , I know you can do this . - Damn it ! Save her ! - Scalpel ! Here we go . Retractor . Okay , retract and give me some suction . Okay , suction here ... and here . And I still can 't see . L - I can 't see it . - Uh - - I see it . There . - L-I can 't , Donner . I can 't . - It 's right there . Find it with my hands . Ah . Got it . Clamp . - Ev , use your hands . - I can 't see it , Donner . It 's right - Oh , God . B.P. ' s rising . He 's coming back . I think I got it . I got it . Help . He 's got it . Her B.P. ' s rising . All right , copy that . Let 's clamp her , and we 'll get to work . - Who 's your oldest trauma surgeon , Doctor ? - Our chief . He 's 75 . You may want to have him finish up . You really have that much trouble with blood ? That 's pathetic . Dr. Smith to Radiology . That was amazing . That 's all I wanted to say . L - I , uh - I just - I just , um - Whatever . Look . Can I buy you a drink after work ? Or something . Or a drink . Yeah . - Okay . - Okay . Well , that was an eventful morning . It 's not usually that exciting around here ... which is the way I prefer it . Do you ever wonder what your life would 've been like ... if you hadn 't left the I.S. O ? Well , I wanted to fly . I wanted to go to space . But I made a choice . No regrets ? Well , that 's the blessing in having a choice , isn 't it ? No regrets . Something wrong ? Cramps . That one was bad . - It 's fine . - Well , then get off your feet . You know , take the rest of the shift off , Zoe . We 'll see you tomorrow . Really . - Thanks . - Already ? No , it-They won 't get bad until tonight . Just need a hot bath and bed . - I 'll be fine . - Zoe ? - Told ya . - Told me what ? - You made the right decision . - That 's not exactly what I got from her . But it doesn 't matter . It 's done . Ahh . - Did anyone bet he 'd make it past lunch ? - Mm-hmm . Mintz . - Man 's on a roll . - Well , you can 't say he went easy on me though . - Mm-hmm . - Mmm . Uh , since he 's already got your money , I think I 'm gonna head out . I 've had enough for one day . Take care of that one , all right ? I 'll try . - God , he came so close . - So close . What , are you following me ? I was gonna ask if you were avoiding me . I saw you change groups earlier . Oh . - Then I probably am . - Yeah ? - Yeah . - You know , uh , we still got five years of training left . And God forbid we 're both on the same crew . Yeah , I know , Donner . We have to work together . - Uh-huh . - I 'm just having a tough day . - They send you home ? - Yeah . How come ? - Cramps . - Oh . - Right . Cramps . Mmm . - Yeah . - Those are pretty bad , huh ? - Yeah . I mean , I - I hear . You mind if we don 't talk about me ? I 'd just rather not . Yeah , sure . So , are you following me ? I , uh - I got a blood thing . - Your blood thing . - Wait a minute . You know about my blood thing ? No . No . - No . Who won the pool ? - Mintz won the pool . I didn 't puke . Yeah , I would never figure you for a blood-fearing man . Just a childhood thing , you know ? - Started with bacon . - Bacon ? Yeah . I used to eat a lot ofbacon . I had an uncle who was a farmer . He was into the whole sustainable thing , and he cured his own meats . Thought I oughta know where bacon came from . So he said if I spent the summer up on the farm , I could have all the bacon I wanted . It sounded pretty good to me . I was nine . Anyway , he had this pig named Thomas . It was kind of my job that summer to just take care of him ... and feed him and clean out his pen . Basically be Thomas 's best friend for the summer . - Pigs are really smart . I didn 't know if you knew that - - What 's going on ? Huh ? - It 's a - It 's what ? - Donner ? - What 's up ? - I need a doctor - now ! - This way . Dr. Allen to E.R. 1 . Dr. Allen to E.R. 1 . Okay . Get her into a bay . Stat for an I.V. Access , now . Let 's move . Okay , what happened ? Was she hit ? She said she was cramping up , and then she just went down . - Cramping ? Okay , don 't worry . We 'll take care of her . - All right . - She 's so sexy . - Yeah , she is . She 's so sexy . Um , there 's no change . There 's no change in his vitals either . See ? It 's untraceable , and it 's good for you . Okay . You two are done here . How about you just take the girl , and my man can hang ? Say good-bye to the degenerate . I 'll be outside . Word up . - But I don 't understand at all . - God , Zoe . Zoe ? Zoe . - God , Zoe . - Get her on a monitor . - Get me some scissors . I 'll cut the pants off . - All right . Uh , Dr. Winkler . Uh , it 's - It 's Zoe . She 's - She 's having a miscarriage . She took an abortion pill this morning . You have to - You can 't let the program know . All I can promise is I 'll try . Okay ? Got it ? Doctor ? An abortion pill ? You can 't tell anyone . - Please . You have to promise - - I would never betray Zoe . - Hey , Wass . - Yo ? - I just had to tell you one thing , man . - Mmm ? Okay , come here . - When you do this stuff , man - - Mm-hmm . You gotta make sure , okay ? You gotta make sure that you just - You just got to , um - You just - Paula ? Doc ! Doc ! - He 's coding ! - No . No , no , that can 't - No , he was - He was just - He was just talking a second ago . He was blabbing . - 10 epi . Charging 200 . - He - And clear ! Again . Clear ! What are you doing ? The blood can clog our air filters . It 's crucial that we clean it up . Yeah , well , opposable thumbs are kinda crucial when you pilot a lander . She can grow it back . Venus is in 12 days . Matrix regeneration takes , like , a month . Steven , even if they reattach her thumb , she won 't be ready . - We don 't know that . - Yes , we do . You don 't even like Paula . That doesn 't matter . If I was on that table , she wouldn 't give up on me . I 'm calling it . What ? Wait . No . You-You can keep going for an hour without - without brain damage . No . I 'm sorry , Paula . He 's gone . Come on . Let 's take a look at that thumb . See , uh , matrix regeneration - She should have a new one in a month . - She won 't be able to pilot the Venus lander . - I think she 'll understand . You think ? You think Paula 's gonna be satisfied ... with her little classroom in space ? Well , that 's why our good doctor 's also a shrink . All right . Let 's cut a clean-edge wound on her hand . 11 blade . Wait ! Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ! Don 't touch it ! Don 't touch it ! I found it ! I found it ! Don 't touch that nub ! I found it ! So how long before she 'll be able to use it ? With a good graft , regen and some time in the hyperbaric chamber ... she could be good in a week , two at the latest . - Still good for Venus ? - She has a real shot , yes . I need to know exactly what was going on with Mintz . That 's what he said . He said he had back pain . - He was upping his meds . - Paula almost died on that table . - That 's what he gave me , Ted . - That sure as hell wasn 't back pain , Donner . I don 't know what you want me to tell you , Ted . I don 't have anything else . I do . You remember that day we were having electrical problems ? I found Mintz in his lab on the floor . Guess the strobing lights ... caused some kind of war flashback or something and - I don 't know what it was about ... but he was - He was deeply affected . He was ... shaking and - - And you didn 't tell me this because what ? - Because he said it was rare . Our lives depend on each other . You are to tell me everything - everything - that could even possibly affect this mission or the other astronauts . No exceptions . Do you understand me ? - Do you understand me ? - Yes . Yes , I do . You know , its fur could clog a filter ... or cause an allergic reaction ... or send an infection airborne . It won 't happen , Zoe . - Free choice has consequences . - I get that . Then can you tell me why ? Got six years to keep my mind on Rollie and offTed . - HALOs for that . - HALOs kill libido . They don 't do a damn thing if you 're lonely . She 'll be all right . They 've stopped the bleeding . - So she 's in Recovery . - You see her ? You 're not responsible for what happened to Zoe . - No , she said it was cramps . - It was . I just feel bad ' cause the whole time I 'm telling her this dumb story ... and she must 've been in a lot of pain . Tell me the story . Well , it was about a pig named Thomas ... that I used to take care of ... because my uncle thought that if you were gonna eat the bacon ... you oughta get to know the pig . I never thought old Thomas could hold that much blood . It must be really exhilarating saving someone ... that way . I 'll forget him after my next drink . I don 't believe that . How can you forget someone whose life you just saved ? You did your residency at Richardson , right ? And then five years on teaching staff atJohns Hopkins . So I 'm guessing 10 patients a day . Weekends off . That 's pretty much it , yeah . My first tour , I saw 3,500 patients in 90 days . I remember procedures , not people . Out of those 3,500 people , you don 't remember one single person ? I remember a schoolgirl in a bombed-out building during the war . Did you save her ? I was the one that called in the strike . We were moving into Ramallah under heavy fire . I was with a forward platoon ... and spotted what I thought was gunfire ... coming from the schoolhouse . Even as medics , we 're - we 're soldiers first . - You understand ? - Yes , of course . I called artillery , gave them the coordinates ... and within minutes the school was shelled . Was on fire . Roof caved in . - And we advanced . - To the school ? To the school . I heard crying coming from inside ... so I crawled under the rubble . And it was a school . It was just a school . Nothing but children . That 's when I saw her . She was reaching out to me . She was calling for me . Another shell exploded on top of us before I could get to her . That 's the scar on your back ? And that 's who you saw on the table ? The schoolgirl ? I 'm a doctor . I 'm a psychiatrist . Whatever this was ... it wasn 't pain medication ... or withdrawal from alcohol . This was a full-blown hallucination . Did you get it all ? I think most of it . I 'm , uh - I 'm so sorry I put all you guys through this . Paula - Paula and I - You need to stop blaming yourself . I was the one moving too fast . She wasn 't ready to catch it . Did you make the hatch door close ? That 's not the point . Point is I can be a complete idiot . Yes , you can . Over and over I ask myself why they chose you for this crew . You 're clumsy , you eat too much ... - and you behave like a 12-year-old boy . - See ? - But you know what ? - What ? Every once in a while you find a thumb . You had an emergency hysterectomy , Zoe . I 'm sorry . Am I out of the program ? No . You had an ovarian cyst . It burst . Our scans didn 't detect it . - A burst cyst ? - That 's what we 're saying . Understand ? Yes . Thank you . You could 've come to me , Zoe . I would 've been able to do something . We never remember the ones we save . And we never forget the ones we fail . It 's about taking responsibility for our choices . About learning from sacrifice . # Where the doors # # Are moaning all day long # # Where the stairs # # Are leaning # It 's those hard lessons that shape us ... and how we respond - where we go in our lives . # Where the windows # # Are breathing in the light # # Where the rooms are # # A collection of our lives # # This is a place where I # I don 't think there 's ever been a man or a woman without some kind of regret . And that 's probably a good thing - # This is a place # because it 's our failures more than our successes ... that make us who we are . Mmm . Ahh . English - US - SDH

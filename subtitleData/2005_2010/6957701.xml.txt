 You can tell a lot about a person from their apartment . If you know how to look . Here 's to forgetting . Some things . ( Bottles clinking ) ( Gulls crying and waves crashing ) ( Birds calling out ) ( Chuckling ) There you are . Here . Don 't you recognise your brother ? 6 ? He 's not my brother . Why would a man deny the existence of his own brother , when he 's standing right in front of him ? Because he 's sick , demented . Isn 't that what you want me to think ? Let us concern ourselves only with evidence . Brought these from home . Remember that ? - Stuff could be fake . - And does your flesh also lie , 6 ? You fell out of a tree and cut your arm . You could have done it while I was sleeping . Buddy , we just want you back the way you were . - You 're not gonna catch anything . - Yes , I will . I did last week . Perhaps therapy might work , yes ? What do you say , 6 ? Give the talking cure a try . Oh , you would like that , wouldn 't you ? Meddling with my mind . What are you afraid of , 6 ? A glimpse into your psyche discovering that you are the problem , after all ? I 'm not afraid . Come on ! Good . The sessions are booked . A man with nothing to hide is a man with nothing to find . ( Chatter and laughter ) WOMAN : Good to see you , 6 . MAN : Home at last . - Hey , look who it is . - Hey , Uncle 6 , you 're not dead ! - Hey , good evening . - Oh , it 's good to see you . - Hey , Dad . - I 've made your favourite . Barbeque pork wraps . - It 's Wonkers ! - ( Excited chattering ) Let 's go in . Ah , see , we never miss Wonkers . - 46-5 ... - Yes ? Oops , there we go . - I don 't like pork . - Oh , go on . It 's your favourite . There is something . OK , so , 765 is in love with 23-30 , but 23-56 is pregnant to 46-5 , and 913 had an affair with 23-30 . I feel ... So , 765 is jealous of 23-30 , and so she , like , took her revenge by sleeping with 46-5 . - 46-5 ... - Yes . - I 'm leaving you . - No ... 765 : Yes . - Oh , no ! Why ? I love your brother . Oh . ( Classical music ) You have a lovely family . I know it ... and I 'm proud of it . But it 's not real , is it ? And I 'm not your brother . My brother 's dead ... and I 'm somebody else . - 6 , it kills me to see you like this . - Did you take anything ? - What ? - Papers from my pocket ? - No . - Cos maybe you work for them . I don 't know . I only know that none ofthis is real . If you won 't go to your therapy , then , I will . I have to , because let me tell you , I just want my brother back . And itjust kills me to ... Why is it so dark in here ? Why does it feel so dark to you ? Well , my home is not my home . My brother 's not my brother . Nothing 's real . ( Chuckles ) And what feels real to you , 6 ? Why should I tell you ? Because it bothers you . Doesn 't it ? ( 6 chuckles ) You can 't cure your thinking with your thinking , 6 . You have to hand it over . There is something in you which you feel the need to find . You feel the need to resolve it . Am I right ? Let me tell you something interesting . Numbers on a phone , how they work . They have a logic , a purpose . I get the feeling this is not merely information . When you borrowed my phone , the number you dialled , it wasn 't a number . That 's pretty observant . What kind of a guy notices stuff like that ? Just someone suspicious . You didn 't make a call . There was something came into your head ? I saw a seagull this morning . - Some kind of bird ? - Yeah , that 's right , some kind of bird . And I got to thinking , " Either you 're a long way from home , or we 're a lot closer to the beach than I realised . " ( 6 chuckles ) And what is " the beach " ? That 's where you go on vacation . Tell us about your vacation . Not much to tell . Me and my brother , we 'd take the train to the sea . ( Boys calling out ) We called it " the edge ofthe world " . Giant saltwater rod for him . A fishing net for me . Wait a minute ... Did you just say " us " ? Who 's " us " ? He is me ... We are me . I find it conducive to work in this way . - I can engage . - And I can reflect . I think we 're done here . 6 , wait ! There 's no requirement that you share your thoughts here with me ... Us . Simply to have them . 6 ! 6 , wait ! I met your brother . Seems like a sweet man . Perspires a lot . I mean , I think he 's a worrier , and I think he 's worried about you , 6 . He 's not my brother . - 6 , just accept the possibility that he is ... - Listen to me . I am not a number . Right . There was something in my pocket . Did you take it ? No , there was nothing in your pocket , 6 . Bye . 6 , there you are . I thought , " What 's the one thing that helps a man not dwell on his troubles ? " Work , huh ? Come on , let 's go see the guys . ( Horn toots ) Hey , 130 . Look who 's here . - ( Cheering ) - Hey , welcome back ! He 's lost some weight , don 't you think , boys ? Looks to me like a man who needs a beer or 12 . We 'll take you out with the boys tonight , 6 . Put some flesh on them bones , huh ? How do you fancy getting behind the old wheel ? - ( Surveillance audio static ) - Why do you think I can drive this thing ? You 're the best there is , 6 . But I 've never driven a bus in my life . ( Chuckles ) Listen to him , boys . How about you just get behind the wheel , and see if it all comes back to ya , huh ? Fire her up . - ( Engine starts ) 16 : Ah , as sweet as a honey nut wrap . ( Chuckles ) ( Yodelling song ) The village tour will depart in approximately one minute and 20 seconds . See the sights ! If you 've already seen them , see them again . See ya ! Bye ! 16 : Your driver today , my buddy and my brother , No.6. Coming up here , on your left , is the Village museum of modern art , containing the famous painting of crying 38-30 , by 794 . And then , coming up , one ofthe highlights of our tour , the clinic . Every day is a sunny day in the village . Moving on now , over to the corner , the newly rebuilt Solar Caf√© . You were right , of course . He is resistant to the possibility of revealing the 6 inside . And why is that ? He feels alone . Oh ! Very good . He dreams of escape . He feels rootless . And yet , his roots are right here , under our feet . What ails the man ? He described ... .. a fishing trip . Fishing ? We like 6 's fishing stories , don 't we , 70 ? Some kind offantasy . Perhaps you 'd do better trying to find the 2 inside . ( Laughs nervously ) Well , why not , since I 'm here . We could have a poke around . See what makes 2 tick . The inside 2 . I 'm curious . I want to know what 's going on inside of me . Let 's start . My wife ... I 'm the reason she 's the way she is . Perhaps we should stay with the matter of 6 . I know I can trust you . I love my son . But I have thoughts ... If he knew me , if he truly knew his father , he might not like me . Do you like me , 70 ? You are 2 . We all love you . But do you like me ? ( Nervously ) I don 't really know you . What I do know is that you are a wonderful man . Of course . You think I believe all ofthis therapy babble , do you ? " My mother sat me sideways on the potty when I was a toddler , so now I want to sleep with her " ? Oh , grow up , man ! Have you had sex with your mother , 70 ? - No . Never . - Well , don 't . 2 ... if I might ask ... If you don 't believe in the value ofthe talking cure ... It 's not necessary for me to believe . It is necessary for 6 to believe . The sights and delights just don 't stop , folks . Actually , this is one of my favourite parts ofthe trip - the desert . My kids , they always say to me , " Dad , what 's beyond the desert ? " and I tell ' em , " More desert . " ( All laugh ) Around every dune , there 's another dune , right ? In a few moments , we 'll pull up for some light refreshments . 91 will be coming around with some delicious wraps . And remember , take out your cameras . This is one ofthe best views ofthe towers . - Where are you going ? - There 's something I wanna see . - Ah , a very slight detour . No cause for alarm . - ( Thud ) ( Passengers gasp then laugh ) WOMAN : What is happening ? - OK , everyone , this is an unscheduled stop . Can you see it on the map ? 16 : Who can tell me what it is ? WOMAN : Some kind of bus that broke down ? 16 : Ah , not even close . What are you doing ? It 's an anchor . Which means , somewhere around here ... is a boat . Yeah , or a ship . A ship means water , and water means ocean , right ? What does ocean say to you ? Anyone ? Uh , this is what 's known as a desert folly , which means it 's a nothing . - No , it 's not . It means escape . - ( Low chatter ) WOMAN : He 's spooking me . MAN : Escape from what ? Yeah ? Come on . Something I wanna show you . MAN : Where are they going ? WOMAN : Are theyjust gonna leave us here ? ( Waves crashing ) What is this place ? It 's the ruins . Were there ever trains ? I don 't get you , 6 . It 's the ruins . It 's the same as it 's always been . We came here every day , when we were kids . We played soldiers , and hide-and-seek . We used to call it " the edge ofthe world " , remember ? How can you forget that ? I ... guess I do feel something , being here . I can 't ... I can 't deny it . But , why ? Why should I feel belonging , when I 've never been here before ? Try to ask yourself , do you really think that whole family , those kids , - are living their lives just to deceive you ? - Maybe . If you 're right , there 's no way out of here . What then ? Can 't we have life here ? Isn 't that something ? Two people , like your brother , his family ... No , no , no , no , no . That 's what they want us to think . 313 , you ever been on a boat ? Why would I ? You don 't know what you 're missing . I noticed you ... sitting on your own . I decided that if I spoke to you you might wanna get to know me . Is that so bad ? Why tonight ? - Why choose the day that I resign ? - Well , maybe it 's a coincidence . Do you know the way ? ( Jaunty music from TV ) ANNOUNCER : Everydayis a sunnyday . It 's Wonkers ! 46-5 : Life is short . 765 : It 's the same thing , over and over , day in and day out . It 's like we can never escape . I 'm 16 , your guide . Your driver today , my buddy and brother , No.6. ( Applause ) Coming up here , on your left , is the Village philharmonic hall . And then , coming up , one ofthe highlights ofthe tour ... The clinic . And next , today especially for you , the home of our great patron . The one , the only , home of you know who - Palais 2 . " Wow " being the operative word here . Wouldn 't it be amazing if 2 came out right now ? ( Chuckles ) MAN : It sure would . Oh , he ... WOMAN : He 's much better-looking than on TV . He 's coming . It 's good to see you looking so much better , 6 . Driving your bus around , spending time with your brother . Family is the greatest gift the village can give us . - Isn 't that right ? - Hmm . Perhaps one day you will have a son , 6 . I recommend it . It 's only when you have family that you learn the meaning of love . Oh . Oh , do sit down . Are we enjoying our little sightseeing trip ? - Wonderful . - Good . - And what do you think of your driver ? - ( Various expressions of praise ) There , good news . One family , here on this bus , has won a holiday , to the Escape resort . I have the ticket here . And the lucky family is ... - 16 . - Yes ! I have always wanted to go to Escape resort . I can 't wait to tell the kids . Fantastic . Thank you . ( Applause ) 16 : And that wraps up our tour for today . I bet you 're all ready for a beer , or 12 . Escape resort . You 're gonna come with us , aren 't you , 6 ? This resort ... Is it by the sea ? - The sea ? - Yeah , you know , the sea - the ocean . Water , waves . Oh , you mean the pool ? You gotta come , 6 . Come away with me . 765 : Life is short . 46-5 : So come away . 765 : You 'd never escape the guilt . 46-5 : 913 wouldn 't care . 765 : It would break 46-5 's heart . - His wife and his own brother . 46-5 : I can 't let you go . 6 : You took them . - No , I ... found them in your pocket . You fool around with me like everything 's a joke . What , do you report on me ? Tell ' em what I say to you ? Why 'd you take them ? I like them . I like the idea of another place . I 'm sorry , I ... I don 't want to lose you ... .. lose our friendship . I was being stupid and ... Look , it won 't happen again . I lied to you . LUCY : You really are suspicious of people , aren 't you ? You would be too if you worked there . You haven 't told me where you work . I am ... I was an analyst for a company called Summakor . We collect CCTV footage from around the world . I watch people , I see things . I collect data and statistics . Myjob is to look for patterns , how we live , .. trying to find out what is going on . And finding out what is going on is not good news . Is that why you resigned ? Why do you ask ? Well , why shouldn 't I be interested in you ? Sorry , it 's what that place does to you . What you need is a distraction . ( Giggles ) You know , I watch people like us doing things like this , and I write about them in my reports . So , if you were watching us now , what would you see ? Two people - a man and a woman - in a room , for one night , because that 's all they 're capable of any more . Please tell me that is not true . - It 's only a report . - It 's what you believe . It 's what I see . ( Door opens and shuts ) It 's ridiculous , I know , but ... .. I 've been lying awake , thinking maybe if I came down , they wouldn 't be here . You loved that thing . You always say that . But I don 't remember it at all . Memory is fickle . 6 says that everything here is fake , unreal . It 's not possible . I mean , why would the world be like that ? It is like that in 6 's mind . Look at me , 1 1-12 . Is this real ? Do I love you like no father ever loved a son before ? When I was your age , I questioned everything . Young men always doubt , challenge . But never doubt your family . Never . Steven , come back ! ( Panting ) Something happened ... in you . A memory . Your fishing trip , perhaps . Your brother ? Do you think it would help me to tell you ? I know it would . 765 is in love with 23-30 . 23-56 is pregnant to 46-5 . 913 had an affair with 23-30 , so 765 is jealous of 23-30 , so she ... He 's running rings around us ! I see your fear , 70 . I 've been watching you . You know you 're a prisoner here just like me . But you don 't wanna know . Well , I refuse to become you . I do remember something about this place . - Like something happened here . - Doesn 't that make it true ? They do it to me somehow . They do it to all of us . One , two ... three ... .. five ... .. six . " Hello to you , who ... whoever you are . I 'm 6 . I 'm eight years old . " You sound like such a clever little 6 . Steven ! - Steven , come back ! - It 's a trick . You knew where it was . You went straight to it . It has to be a trick . It has to be . Tell me why you resigned . Please . I worked on a floor called " Analysis " . We don 't know who works on the next floor . We never see them . I started to notice something , and , like a good boy , I reported up . And what was it ? People changing . Too many people . So I sent in the report . Got a three-word reply . " Cease and desist . " But ifyou could find out why Solutions wanted you to stop . Who are you ? You work in Summakor . You said " Solutions " . I didn 't . No more bullshit . Who are you ? Yes , I work there . You sit there , you look at me , and you tell me why you 're here ? You think you resigned . Maybe you did , but it 's not over . They still control you . 6 : I 'm er ... going on vacation with my brothertomorrow . You called him your brother . Do you see ? I see I need to get out of here before I become a part ofthis place . I er ... be seeing ya . There 's a reason I go on those bus trips . I heard the ocean once . They stopped the bus . I kind ofwandered off away . I heard waves crashing . I heard the ocean . 147 : You know , I 'm all for a wild-goose chase . I 'm an affirmative kind of guy , generally speaking , but , " I can hear big water " ? " Somewhere , there 's the sound of splashing " ? Please . - You mind ifwe just shut up and drive , please ? - Sounds good . ( Tannoy chime ) It 's non-stop to the Escape resort , departing in approximately four and half minutes . - Where is he ? - I don 't know . 147 : She 's a crazy , 6 . ( All panting ) 147 : Man , we are right where we were . And we were here even before that . And we are right here again . WOMAN : Maybe it was an illusion . Maybe I never heard it . Listen to me , you did hear something . You have to keep believing that you heard it . I wish I could . I wish I could hear it now . Try . 147 : Listen . 6 : Follow the towers . 2 put you up to this , didn 't he ? What ? All this talk ofthe ocean . Yes , he did . He wants to throw me offtrack . ‚ô™ We 're going on a trip ! - No , no , no , no , it 's today ! - Where you going , man ? - My family ! ( Chuckles ) ( Car backfires ) 16 : I knew you wouldn 't let us down . I told them . Didn 't I tell ya ? 6 never missed a vacation in his life . Come on . What are we waiting for ? All right , everyone , we 're all gonna have a nice , normal vacation . 16 : You can 't get to the towers . It 's not possible . You know that , 6 . Do you know the way ? Come on ! ‚ô™ Is it hot as hell in here or is it me ? ‚ô™ It really is a mystery ( 2 chuckling ) ‚ô™ If I die before I wake ‚ô™ I pray the Lord my soul to take my misery ‚ô™ I could really use a drop to drink ‚ô™ Feel like I was really in the pink ‚ô™ I lose a dream when I don 't sleep ‚ô™ I 'm slumberin' ‚ô™ There 's still a promise we must keep ‚ô™ I 'm wondering ‚ô™ A wah ha wah ‚ô™ hawaii ‚ô™ A wah ha wah ‚ô™ Hawaii lay beyond the sea ‚ô™ A wah ha wah ‚ô™ Hawaii ... 16 : Do you hear me ? ! You gotta cut this out ! You gotta stop this ! I found something amongst the ruins . Something of mine from when I was a boy . I keep trying to prove I 'm right , find a way out . But what if I am wrong ? What if I am your brother ? All you 've given me is love and kindness . I 've repaid you with cruel accusations . Maybe I am insane . I 'm sorry for all the pain I 've caused you . You 're a good man . I do trust you . Hey ... I 'm glad I have a brother . 6 ... I 'm not your brother . I 'm sorry ! Please , you 've gotta help me now ! You 've gotta help me . I 'm sorry . ( Screaming ) I try to be a good father . You know , give them something good to look back on . This place , it 's what you dream of . For a guy like me , it 's out of reach . I 'm scared ofthem , 6 . They 're watching us all the time . Look at me , I 'm shaking like a leaf . Look , I need a beer . 6 : What is it they want from me ? They must have told you something . My head is so confused with confusion . I ... I don 't even know ifwhat I just told you is true or not . The other place . Something about you talking about some other place . - Stop it . - Are they really your family ? I don 't even know any more . I know it sounds stupid , but ... I sort of do think of you as my brother . Me , too . 6 , is there another place ? There is . You gotta help me get out there . They will get me . They 're gonna get me . No , we 'll get out first . It isn 't there , is it ? 2 will know we were out here . He 'll know that I betrayed him . I promise you , we 'll find it . ( Gulls crying ) Steven , come back ! 16 : Whoo-hoo ! 16 , come back ! I 'm onlyjust getting started . Come on ! Get back here ! Ah ! ( Desperate moaning ) ( Gasping for breath ) It 's gone . - I have to tell you something . - Ssh ! Uncle 6 , Wonkers is on . - ( They laugh ) - Your father ... Your father 's dead ! - He drowned . - ( They continue laughing ) ( Howls ) Oh , 1 1-12 , none of us can choose our family . 6 : He swam in the ocean , tasted the saltwater in his mouth , felt the power ofthe waves . There is a way out ofthis place , no matter how loudly you shout that there isn 't ! You 're the one who is shouting , 6 . The louder a man shouts , the more profoundly he 's wrong . I 'm not wrong . I 'm telling you the truth . My brother is dead . 6 . You see how he feels about his brother ? It hurts ... as only a family can hurt . Oh , no . I didn 't mean that . I didn 't mean my " brother " . Oh , 6 . Oh , poor 6 . I am not a number . I am not a number . I am ... I am ... Yes , 6 ? My name is ... Damn it ! My name is ... Oh ... I am 6 . He 's 6 . - I am 6 ! - That 's right . I am 6 ! I am 6 , you bastard !

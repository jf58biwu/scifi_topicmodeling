 This one , Jeremiah , he died in detention , he got sick . And ... She ... She killed herself . But these two ... I got them out . But nobody ... Nobody knows what happened to the child . I tried so hard . - Hey , you did great . I tried so hard ! - You saved so many of them . Okay ? I 'm sorry . You can think of more names and we can write more lists . Of course we can . Of course we can . We will . Yeah . - Okay ? Thank you . Listen . Okay , listen . There 's something I can do . I can interface with the Raptor 's computer and determine the corrupted memory address . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Yeah , wait , I remember you . You did that once ... One of you did that once . It 's who you are , am I right ? But if the others see me doing it , they 'll think I 'm sabotaging the ship , so you 'll have to stand guard . How ? Brooks ? What 's wrong ? Something 's wrong . Hey , wake up . Lethal dose . What 's going on ? I won 't tell them . - Oh my Gods ! I heard you moving around . - What did she do ? What did you do ? I told you she killed the other one . - I won 't say anything . Thanks , buddy . Wait ! He might have killed himself . We don 't know . That 's it . - And you wanna take a chance ? We don 't know . We don 't know ! - It 's okay . I understand . It 's okay . It 's okay .

 My mum and dad . We could go through there , into another time . It 's only dangerous to go back in time if you change something . Where are Sarah Jane and Luke ? 1951 ? It 's her , my mum . Eddie Smith . August 18th . It 's the date they died . I could save them with the sonic . It 's happening . Time for me to collect my prize . I don 't like this at all . What 's happened ? I 'm going through . Aaaaaaagh ! This is our time , our world . You gave this planet to the Trickster ! You gave me what I wanted , all those years ago . In 1951 . You 're lying . How could me saving my mum and dad do all of this ? They 're just two ordinary people ! This place is a weak point on the web of time . In the grand scheme of things , yes , you saving your parents was a tiny thing . But the village is on the faultline , and you smashed right through it . Time was broken open ? I existed only in the Limbo Dimensions . I could only walk in the shadows , appear only in your reality for fleeting moments . But you gave me a path into this world . I exist here in the flesh , for ever ! I 've defeated you before . I can do it again . We 're going back . To 1951 . Do you not understand ? The battle is over . You 've already lost . Mum , come on ! EVIL LAUGHTER I don 't get it . This is Earth , 21st century . Right now . It 's an alternative timeline . The box protected us like it protected Maria the last time the Trickster appeared , when the world changed around her . This is Earth ? Today ? Yep . And this is all that 's left of London . Where are all the people ? Gone . It 's all my fault ! All we have to do to change things back is repair the car . And I send my parents off to their deaths ? It 's the only way ! I can 't do it . If it was me , Luke , could you ? I won 't kill them ! There must be another way . There 's always another way ! Negative energy readings , coming from the village . He 's breaking through , somewhere down there . It 's so cold . That 's not natural . It 's starting , he 's coming through ! Looks like rain . Astonishing how it 's turned . Right , everybody inside ! Come on ! Look lively ! Into the village hall ! Come on ! Never seen it turn so bad so quickly . It 's creepy . Come on , love , let 's get inside ! Chop , chop , everybody into the hall ! Are you OK ? I 've been chased by Slitheen . I 've been aboard a spaceship . I 've had a Sontaran shooting at me . I always thought , I dunno , all in a day 's work . Because it was scary and brilliant all at the same time . Yeah , that 's what I feel . But this is different . We 're in an alternative timeline . Our world never existed . So how do we get back home from here ? We keep walking ? Look ! Right . He 's gotta be on his way somewhere . I can 't get an exact fix on him . But he 's here somewhere . I 'm lost . We saw the Trickster in the future . But he hasn 't manifested himself yet . That 's about to happen here , in 1951 . If we can find him , perhaps we can still stop him . But how ? What 's that " other way " ? How can we stop him ? I don 't know . Yet . There 's only one person in the universe who would know . Straight away . One person who could help us . And where is he whenever you need him ? Oh , yes ! Yes ! I don 't believe it ! Doctor ! It 's me ! Doctor ! Won 't find a doctor in here , my love . What do you want ? Nothing . Sorry , officer . It 's just a police box , that the Tardis looks like . They were everywhere . That 's as may be , but if you don 't mind , missus ? We can do this ourselves . Why 's he still running round ? There 's nothing here . Yeah , what does he want with Earth when it 's in this state ? Get down ! Slowly ... Humans , stop ! Humans , rest ! They 're slaves . Oh , no . No , Clyde . Tell me that 's not her . Mum ! Stay back ! He 's seen us ! Deviants ! You don 't belong . He 's scared of us . That 's my mum ! Stop , Rani ! We 've got to stay together , there 's only one box . Where is he ? It all looks the same . Wait . The Trickster must have been planning this for a while , before we even came here . Someone in the village might have seen something strange . But how do we stop him ? We worry about that when we 've found him . Village hall ! Come on ! How can she be here ? Luke told me once that when time goes wrong , it tries to compensate , keep people on the same track . Mum ? No talking ! Go away ! Mum , it 's me , it 's Rani ! Why are you walking free ? Nobody walks free . Graske says no talking . Go away ! What 's he making you do ? Tell me . We 're digging . The world 's dead . It fell apart . The Graske made us dig . He won 't stop till the last minerals are torn up . Come on , organise a rebellion . Where 's everybody else ? We 're the last humans . What have they done to you ? Go away ! Mum , please . Where 's Dad ? Your husband . Haresh . No husband . Go ! She was born into this world . Never met my dad . I don 't exist any longer . Rani , come on , we are going back . There 's always a way . What happened ? How did the world die ? Everybody knows the legend . It was her ! Who 's her ? I mean , who 's she ? Sarah Jane Smith . What ? You 're not serious . She handed the world to the Trickster . What exactly happened ? What did she do ? The legend says , years ago , he tricked her . There was a ... car . Her parents never left in the car , and that made a hole in the world , in the Abbots ' Gateway . The Trickster walked through the Abbots ' Gateway and sucked the life out of the world . The Abbots ' Gateway ? What 's the Abbots ' Gateway ? Humans ! Back to work . Go ! Mum , I 'll save you , I promise . Everything 's gonna be all right , I promise ! No talking ! Go away ! The Abbots ' Gateway ... hang on , I 'm working this out . We have to get back there and tell them that the Trickster 's coming through the Abbots ' Gateway , whatever that means . How can we get back there ? The fissure 's shut , and it 's the only way back . The Graske works for the Trickster , right ? But why ? What does he get out of it ? No idea . He can 't grab us or send us anywhere weird if we 've got the box . Nowhere can be worse than this . THUNDER RUMBLES It 's getting worse out there . Shame , I thought we could go for a drive later . Here we go . Sustenance for the troops . Oh , hi , hi there . You 're going to think this is very strange , but ... we need to ask you something . Have you noticed anything new or strange in the village ? Something that wasn 't there before ? No . What are you talking about ? Please think , it 's important . Are you two having a laugh ? Can you come with us , see if anything has changed ? But why ? What 's going on ? We can 't explain . Are you taking the mick ? Look after Sarah Jane . I won 't be five minutes . Barbara , what are you doing ? They look like they 're in trouble . None of our business ! What 's got into your mummy , Sarah Jane ? Are you sure about this ? I 'm just gonna do it the way Sarah Jane does it . We demand audience . You are rejects . No place here for you . Go ! Send us home ! This is your home . Trickster makes this your home . They 're your slaves , right ? Take rocks from this planet . Give Trickster powers to leave , go into space . Take other worlds . And then what ? Another job for the Trickster ? Cos they 're your slaves , but you 're his slave , aren 't you ? Graske never enslaved ! Then why do you work for him ? Human stupid ! Trickster stole me . What happened ? Tell us . You ! Ha ! Stupid ! Can 't be that thick if we 've got this , can we ? Give it to me ! Humans must give box to Graske . Uh-uh . You tell us how he got you . I was stupid ! Should have died ! Trickster tricked me . I was in spaceship . Burning up . Krizlok of the Graske . Listen to me . You don 't have to die . I can lift you away , to be safe at my side . But I must have your agreement . What are you ? Do you want to live ? Do I have your agreement ? Agreed ! Agreed ! .. I 'm a slave . But you wanna escape ? Be free ? Look at this . It fights the Trickster 's power , protects us from him . And you . Give it to me ! So you do wanna be free ? Think ! We can help you . Sarah Jane , the lady you tricked into doing all of this . She 's defeated the Trickster once before . But Trickster find me ... I never escape . Then I promise , this time we 'll stop him . Then we 'll give you this . He 'll never find you , you 'll be free . Open the fissure . Let us go back to Sarah Jane . We can help her . We can stop him like she did before . Will open fissure . Yes ! Thank you ! You ! Stay with box . No . We can 't do that ! He needs a guarantee . A hostage ? I 'm not leaving you here . I 'll be fine . I 've had a bellyful of time travel anyway . Go ! Clyde ... Hurry ! Go ! Cool . Must be heroic more often . Remember ! The Abbots ' Gateway ! I 'll save you , Mum . Right . Let 's go ! I can 't see anything , David . It all looks the way it always has . The way it always will be . There must be something . Luke ! I think I 've found something ! What is that ? Tell me . What have you found , Mum ? An unusual energy reaction . I can 't see anything . But he must be here . Listen ! I 'm helping you ! And you 've not answered any of my questions . I really am sorry , but we can 't . You think I 'm stupid but I 'm not . That thing , the way you talk - " energy reaction " - are you from somewhere else ? No . And I don 't think you 're stupid , Barbara . I think you 're amazing , and a brilliant mother , and more than I ever hoped you 'd be but I can 't say anything more . No sign of your winner yet , Mr Smith ? No . Something 's not right with that lad , or his mother . Sandwich ? Ham there , cheese there . Never say no to free grub . Oh ! My goodness . Yes , hello , ethnic person in the ' 50s ( ! ) Hi . Listen , please , it 's important . Not another one . I 'm looking for Sarah Jane Smith . What ? Well , what do you want ? She 's right there . Oh , wow . And you 're her dad , right ? What do you want ? What 's going on ? No , I didn 't mean I was looking for her . I 'm looking for a woman , short , brown hair , very pretty . Probably with her son . He 's a bit ... weird . You mean Victoria Beckham ? What ? Well , they were here . Right . Where 've they gone ? They 're around . Said they were looking for something unusual , whatever that means . Right . Thank you ! What on earth was she wearing ? Can that really be the fashion in the Punjab ? Mrs King , will you watch the baby , please ? Of course , off you pop . Luke ! Luke ! THUNDERCLAPS Rani ! Over here ! Sarah Jane ! How did you get here ? Long story . Why did you call her that ? I did it again . Who are you , and why did you call her Sarah Jane ? You stopped your parents . They never got in the car , right ? Yes , but how can you know that ? Doesn 't matter . The important thing is , the Abbots ' Gateway . The Trickster is coming through the Abbots ' Gateway ! What 's the Abbots ' Gateway ? Over there . It 's what they call that arch thing . Of course . Religious sites , hallowed ground , sometimes that 's where the web of time is at its weakest . I can 't see anything . Same emission patterns , nothing specific . No sign of him . But I know The Trickster comes through here ! How do you know ? My mum told me . Your mum ? What ? Listen . You called her Sarah Jane . Why did you call her Sarah Jane ? THUNDERCLAPS Oh , yes . There ! A crack in time . He 's coming through . What 's that ? Oh , no ... EDDIE : Barbara ! You 're coming back home with me . Right now . Wait . Eddie , look ! That thing . Something 's happening , something really strange . We 're going home , now ! You stay away from us ! I didn 't want it to be like this . Soon ... I 'll be free ! There you are ! All settled , I hope . The storm 's getting worse . Not that anything bothers madam . I 'll leave you both to it , then . Look , let 's cheer ourselves up a bit , eh ? We 'll go home , switch on the wireless and see what 's on the Light Programme tonight . What the heck 's going on ? It 's rotten . It 's to do with us . Eddie , look . What 's happening ? Everything we touch turns bad . It 's us . Something 's wrong with us . I can breathe . Soon , I will be strong ! I can find the frequency you 're using to manifest yourself and block it . Empty words . Technology cannot help you . No . I 'm going to send you back ! Soon all three of you will cease to exist . I will step from this door ... and consume this world in chaos ... It 's not too late . There 's only one way to stop him , Mum . We 've both known it all along . No ! I can 't ! Use the sonic . Repair the car . .. and send your parents to their deaths ! Will you be the agent of their destruction ? That Indian girl , she said something to Victoria . She said " You stopped them driving off , they never left in the car . " As if it was a bad thing that we didn 't go . And not going , that let out that terrible creature under the arch . None of this makes sense . It does if you think about Victoria , who she really is . That girl ... she called her Sarah Jane . BABY GURGLES I said I 'd seen her before . Too late ! I 'm growing stronger ! It 's too late , they won 't drive off and you won 't make them . Rani 's right . I won 't kill my own mum and dad , I can 't do it ! He 's beaten me . Victoria ! If we get in the car and drive away right now , then that 's the end of that thing under the arch . I know I 'm right . You can 't . You mustn 't go . We 've got to . But not Sarah Jane . Not our baby . Take her . Look after her . This is why they left that day . They didn 't abandon you , Mum . They saved you . One thing , though . It 's important . Sarah Jane , our baby - is she safe , does she have a good life ? Yes . So many incredible things . Things you wouldn 't believe . Don 't go . Got to , though , haven 't we ? Like he worked any of it out . I said , didn 't I ? I don 't understand it but sometimes the heart knows things the mind can 't explain . Mum ... Dad ... Come here . Come here ! THEY SOB Look at you . Older than us ! And you came all that way to see us . I thought you 'd left me behind . I never knew you - I never had the chance . It was so unfair . Who said life was fair , eh ? I tried so hard to resist the temptation , I knew the dangers . I just couldn 't stop myself . I had to see you . I 'm so glad you did . So am I , Mum . Goodbye , Sarah Jane . Goodbye , Sarah Jane . Goodbye , Sarah Jane . Bye , Dad . I won 't forget you . I 'll never forget you ! No ! Stop them . Stop them ! You ... have denied me ! My hunger ... I did nothing . That was my mum and dad saving the world , something we Smiths can 't help doing . But you ... you couldn 't do it . I knew you could never do it . You were right . I couldn 't send them off . But you didn 't count on one thing - they were brilliant . They worked it out , they went by themselves . My mum and dad defeated you ! HE WAILS BABY GURGLES We 've got to put things back on track . We 've got to leave her . GRASKE GROWLS Whoa ! Hold on ! This is it ! LOW RUMBLING CLYDE SCREAMS Yes ! See , I told you , she did it ! Sarah Jane is da man ! Give box ! We did deal ! I 'm a man of my word . Ha ! Free ! Right . Come on , Sarah Jane . ELECTRONIC BEEPS AND BUZZES RASPING BUZZING Yes ! Welcome home ! Sarah Jane , look at you ! You did it ! We did it , the team ! I 'm missing something , aren 't I ? This time ... it stays closed . Let 's go home . Hello ! You didn 't say you were with Sarah . I 've been phoning all afternoon . I was just about to get worried ! Ooh , I like your look ! Where 've you been ? Somewhere nice ? Mum ! Come here . What 's brought this on ? What are you after ? Sarah , come on , what 's she done ? She 's been great . Rani , the state of your room , like a bomb 's hit it . Dad ! I 'll go and clean my room right now . I 'll do anything you want . What did I do to deserve this ? I thought you were too old for cuddles . Oh , no . Not for as long as you live . Bye , Sarah , bye , boys . Come on , you . You still have to do your room . I 'll be off home , then . I 've been to an alternative timeline and now I 'm saying " I 'll be off home , then " ? That 's the life we lead . Sometimes it brings you such joy , and sometimes it brings you the worst things in the world . That 's all I ever had of them . But life goes on . It has to . Oh , Luke , they were my mum and dad . And they were wonderful . It 's made me realise . I 'm so lucky , because I 've got my mum . I 've got you . PANICKED BREATHING Hello , Luke . My mum , she 's disappeared . Is it aliens ? What do you want ? Your help . After kidnapping my mum and entrancing her ? Sarah Jane Smith . I need to break into the Black Archive . Get the scroll , find Horath and stop them bringing him back to life . It 's attack of the one-eyed squiddy things ! ALARM BLARES We have a security breach ! Surrender , or be devoured !

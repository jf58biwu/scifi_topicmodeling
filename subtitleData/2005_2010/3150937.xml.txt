And then after weeks of hearings , the Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote today on the nomination of Judge Walter ... Get out of my house . - Get out of my head . - What do you want ?

What 's today 's date ? October 6th . What year ? 1987 . Sorry to bother you . - What are you doing here ? - I can 't find Dan . - When was the last time you saw him ? - Last night . I woke up this morning and he wasn 't there , he didn 't show up to work , missed the deadline , he hasn 't called , it 's just not like him . I heard you guys were having some problems . That was a while ago . Could there be anyone else in his life ? You mean like another woman ? I have to ask these questions , Kate . No one I know of . Except maybe Livia . Yeah , well ... he married you . And Livia 's been dead for like , 9 years . I don 't think he left me , Jack , if that 's what you mean . So what do you want me to do ? You 're a cop and his brother , you tell me . It 's a little early to file a Missing Persons . All right . I 'll talk to some of the guys and ... put the word out . Thank you . You okay ? I 'm okay , yeah . I think so . Maybe you should go home . Sleep it off . I almost killed myself ... over a woman . Crazy , uh ? They can make you do that some times . What 's your name ? Dan . I 'm Neal Gaines . Neal . Thanks , man . Lot of time left in the clock . Move on . And no kidding . I 'll be fine . I 'll take something to sleep . I 'm just running out of things to tell Zack . I 'm home . Zack might still be awake . Where have you been , Dan ? I don 't know . - You don 't know , because ... - I don 't remember . Just going to bed last night and having this long vivid dream . I save this guy 's life , Neal something , and then I woke up . So you 're saying this is some sleep disorder . I don 't know what else it can be . Unless I was drugged . Something 's happening to me , I can 't explain it . Like the other night , I fell asleep in one cab and woke up in another . Maybe you should go see Dr. Paulin in the morning . - Yeah , I will . - Unless ... you 're hanging out with Eddie again . You can tell me the truth . I have been here , here in this house , in this city . No , you 've been gone for two days ! Two days ? Maybe you could have ... lobbed in a phone call . I couldn 't . Why ? This was 20 years ago . - So ? - I 'd rather not get into it . Really ? You missed the deadline on your story , you scared the hell out of your wife , and there 's not gonna be any accountability . You said the story wasn 't time sensitive . It wasn 't then , but now it is . You 'll get it today . All I need ... is a second source , it just takes a phone call . What 's going on , Dan ? I mean , is it gambling or ... something else ? It 's not gambling , and it won 't happen again . Finish the mayor story . - I want it by noon . - Right , thank you . And yet , you 're standing . Dan Vasser for Gary Tucker ? Thank you . Well , how long ? You said that last time . He exists . You 've reached the offices of the of the brain psychiatry . Our directory has changed , so listen carefully ... I won 't like being nervous . Just remember that the other kids are gonna be nervous too . And remember , the more you know the song , the less nervous you 'll be . Practice + Confidence = Success . - Exactly . - Dad 's car looks like that . Dad 's car looks like that one ! You can see a late model blue Mustang directly below me , which appears to be the car that started the collision . - Hello ? - Katie , it 's Hugh . Is Dan around ? He 's two hours late on a deadline . - No , he 's been in a car accident . - Is he okay ? I don 't know , he ... ran a red light , hit two cars and ... he left the scene , Hugh . - Oh , God . - No one else was hurt , thank god . I think Dan needs help . No kidding ? There 's a facility in Auburn I know is good . Auburn is for drug users . Hold on . See this guy next to me ? Beam me up Scotty Is there a problem ? - Sorry . - It 's okay . Neal , I think we should ... Nicole , please . I want to make this work . - I do too . - I love you - and I want to start a family with you . - But not now . You always say that . Neal , I 've made up my mind . I 'm not keeping it . You know where I stand . And you know what I want . - Fine , Nicole . - Neal ! Sorry . I 'm so sorry . Livia ? Do I know you ? Not yet . You 're freaking me out with the staring . The hooker outfits is my day job , I 'm a student by night . Sorry . It 's just ... You look like someone I once knew . You once knew ? Didn 't end well . Well , don 't take it out on my gratuity Try to spill any more drinks on me and I won 't . Sorry , I 'm just ... having a bad day . You shouldn 't stress about school , you 'll be a great lawyer some day . Who said anything about law school ? I thought you did . The conversation 's over . Hey , Neal ! What did he do to you ? Nothing , he owes me some money . You ? Knocked me up . There 's not gonna be a baby shower . Got that right . I told him from the start " no kids , " I just ... I just got this job . We went through the same thing with Zack , my son . Do you regret it ? Having a kid ? I 'd do anything right now to be back to him . - Good luck with that . - Thanks . You too ! So ... were you high when you ran the red light ? - Is that why you took off ? - It 's not drugs . I told you the truth and I go on these ... - These trips - Through time . Go ahead , you can say that . That 's exactly what I mean , I 'd rather people think I 'm a crack addict than think I 'm crazy . Where did you trip to this time ? - You 'll never believe me . - Try me . Remember that guy I told you about ? His name is Neal Gaines . Now I think I am tracking his life . I think I just helped him start a family . Well , that 's great ! How about sticking around and saving this one ? No , I 've got from thinking that ... that you ran out on us to wondering if you 're lying bleeding in some alley . I 've stuck with you for some pretty tough times . But at least back then you came home at night . It 's not ready . Here 's the thing , it was supposed to be ready last week , I need that ring today , so I need you to do it now . I 'll sit here all day if I have to but I 'm not leaving without it . It 's not my birthday . So I 'm gonna go with an ... - intervention ? - Don 't be mad . - Where 's Zack ? - At my Mum 's . Everyone 's here 'cause we care about you . Everyone here is getting it wrong . I 've been where you 've been . I guarantee you you have not been where I have been . Guys , I know you all care about me and I appreciate it but substance abuse is not my problem . And don 't say I am in denial , even though I am in full denial mode . I 'm not going anywhere . I 'll still be here when you get back . Come on . Seriously . If any Vasser has a drinking problem , it 's me . Can I talk to you a sec ? You 're the last person I expected to come to my defense . I didn 't . I 'm here to arrest you for felony hit-and-run . Can I call my lawyer ? I 'm pretty sure you can 't do that . Where have you been ? - Am I under arrest , or not ? - I bring you in for questioning . Katie did a story on how you ask questions at this precinct and believe me , I need a lawyer . You don 't need a lawyer 'cause I 'm not gonna charge you . No one saw you flee the scene , in fact , one witness says no one wasn 't even driving so , short of nailing you for not setting the parking brake , I got nothing . Sit down . So ... Why don 't you tell me what the hell is going on and we can all go home ? I wish I knew . Katie says you disappeared for a couple days and didn 't even know it . Something like that . And you went back in time . It 's just these dreams , but I 'm glad you two are talking again . - She came to me . - This may work out great for you . I wouldn 't do that to a brother . You only have yourself to blame . Can I go now ? Sure , Dan . But ... tell your wife I tried to listen . I saw Livia . On this ... On this last ... trip , or whatever . I wanted to tell her not to get on that plane , but I didn 't . I said something about her life that hadn 't happened yet . I spooked her . I might have blown my chance of her liking me before we ever met . Anyway ... Forget it . Get some help . Seriously . Dead ? Taxi ! 18.97 . - Just- - Keep the change . - Thank you . Howard Street . Howard next . I locked myself out again Mrs. Shay . Hey , what are you doing here ? You 're never home during the day . I needed something for work . The fitness hearing got cancelled , so you wanna go off to the restaurant together ? I can 't , I ... - I 'll see you there - Okay . I was talking to Gerald . He agreed . Napa 's too expensive . And he knows about these old officer 's quarters and a procedure that 's better . For what ? Our wedding reception , dummy . Livia ... Unless you have changed your mind about marrying me . - Never . - Are you okay ? Yeah , why ? - You look different . - Different ? Tired . It 's been a long week . You wanna talk about it ? Wouldn 't know where to start.I I don 't know if I can save the week , but your day 's about to get better . I gotta go . Are you sure you 're all right ? I 'm on a deadline . We 'll finish this later . How did you- - It is you . How did you get out of here ? Don 't go in there . This way . Now . Stop ! They found the plane in the water but not your body . So , did you even get on that plane or am I just talking to a ghost ? It 's me . I left before it went down . - What ? - Do you know why you 're here ? - No . - You now who you 're following ? Some guy and his family . Stay on it . Go with your instincts . What if I get it wrong ? You will , that 's part of it . Just don 't mess with anything . I don 't think I 'm not supposed to be here . Hello ? Hey , it 's me . I need a favor , it 's kind of urgent . Like what ? I gotta find someone and I only have a name . - I tried information . - You 're asking , " Can I violate protocol and use the police database to help out my kid brother ? " I forgot that you weren 't just recently a prick , that goes back years - Excuse me ? - Nothing , listen . At least two people I know are gonna die tonight . - You 're kidding . How ? - I don 't know . This is gonna sound crazy but I know they 're gonna die in 1997 and there 's only a few hours left . What are you talking about ? Forget it , I just need you to help me find someone . His name is Neal Gaines . Hello , are you there ? - Who is this ? - What do you mean ? - You 're not my brother . - Of course , I am . You 're not , 'cause I 'm looking at him right now . You know , we 're having lunch at Luna , if you want to come by and meet him , get pass , we 'll kick your ass . Hey , guys . Quiet , I wanna make a toast ! - What ? - Thank you . I wanna make a toast to Dan and Livia .

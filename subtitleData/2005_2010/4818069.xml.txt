 but didn 't pan out . I 'm pretty disappointed . Being a man or a woman is beside the point . It 's the person 's skill that makes the difference . Waste of my time . You could all bundle your genes into a nice variety pack and I 'd still pass . But that was nipped in the bud . you were already over . the one whose genes I 'll receive appears to be you ! How many times must you crush something precious to me before you 're satisfied ? I don 't remember how Mom looked when she smiled . But this house was filled with her kindness . I 'll do it for myself . That 's all . I 'm going to cut those ties you are unable to let go of . I became arrogant . Thinking of myself as someone chosen ... And then I lost everything . I cursed people . Falcon . Iceman ? I won 't kill you . I 'll leave you behind me . You 've changed ! that 's all . Rouge . I 'm gonna win the finals tomorrow . I 'm going to the moon ! Just you wait ! genes ... I 'm going to settle my fight once and for all . CRASH ! the championship game is tomorrow . The furious fight between Team Basquash and King of Kings will bring the tournament to a close . jubilation ... The whole town was drunk on Basquash ; no one slept that night . this town will be reborn . but ... The storm is near . Watch over me . I swear we 'll win . 100 ) } boku ga boku no mama irareru basho sagasou 100 ) } tsuki ni terasare hashiridasu yo 100 ) } furui shakai nado shikato shite 100 ) } bokura ga terashi ruuru ni nare { ? } 100 ) } hora ! buchikowase kono te de 100 ) } kimi ga kimi no mama motomeru basho wa doko 100 ) } dare no iinari ni mou naru na yo 100 ) } yume wa shinjiru furikazase 100 ) } boku ga boku no mama iru tame ni wa itsumo 100 ) } shinjita omae wa tsuranukunda 100 ) } sou da saigo wa kisu shitai 100 ) } I 'm gonna look for a place where I can stay the way I am .

First to score is King of Kings ! Shit ! They 're good . Why that ... Mom ! Milady . You ... But destroying the whole town to rebuild it ... Sir . right ? That means nothing . they 'll understand . This was a good opportunity . They 're really going for it . Mr. Roberto ! and now they 're even further behind ... Can 't you see he 's working ? ! I beg your pardon . But since the young lady is playing in this match ... Young lady ? C 'mon in ! huh ? King of Kings ' attacks show no signs of weakening ! this seems to be giving them even more energy ! Too bad Team Basquash is still dragging ! Ahh ! Dunk Mask fell down again ! Dunk Mask ? ! Thanks ! There you are ! Sorry ! Bad footing don 't bother us . Is that so ? Dan ! Run ! You don 't have to tell me ! I can 't stop ! It 's mine ! Not a chance ! Goal ! King of Kings scores yet again ! Milady .

G-Get outta the way ! Iceman . the only teams that would take you on are no better than this . Falcon ! Iceman ! Sela too ! Run where I tell you to ! Even a legend can end before he starts if he can 't stand up . don 't be too hasty . Dan ! I 'm having trouble ' cause I can 't stomp harder ! Dan ! The other two are behind you !

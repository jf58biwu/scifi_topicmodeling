Did you think George Clooney was going to pop out from under the beard ? Don 't play under me . Don 't play under me . That 's it . Get in over here . Dear Monkeys , based on the movies I 've seen nearly 4 minutes have elapsed in the parallel universe . If I hang with you any longer , I won 't be able to return to my own time to save Ceku . This is why I 'm leaving . Our food and water is low . I 'll first find water , then I 'll look for other civilisations . I would 've loved to have made your acquaintance under different circumstances . But that wasn 't the case . Okay then , bye bye . No , don 't get up . Not that you can get up . Bye bye Cino . Bye bye .

You 're the best brother . There 's nothing here so you can go now . [ LOUD POWERFUL ROAR ] If you keep roaring like that all of the carnivores will show up . It 's like a war cry . Please . Stop it man . Of course , you are aware of the rules in the forest ? Yes , there is a natural food chain . That eats this , this eats that . You grew up without love in this jungle so I understand that you think you 're right . I 'm better than most people and because we just met , I 'm not going to disagree .

He doesn 't know our language . - We can 't hold him here . He 's a stranger . He 's not himself , he doesn 't know what he 's saying . If we help will he be a burden to us ? - Cuhara ? - This stranger broke your rope . - And frightened the children . No , there was none of that . What will we do ... tear his head off , feed him to the carnivorous birds ? No brother . How can you think that ? [ SPEAKING IN AROG ] Brother , there were no subtitles for the last thing he said . He may have said the wrong thing . Look , young man . When a donkey eats from an unfamiliar field , he gets a headache . Write it down . That is a great proverb . - Come on . - Well okay ... Wherever you came from or going to , I don 't know . Just don 't cause trouble . Father , I 'm from another time . Really . I 've been suffering around here for months . Right now , about 6 minutes have passed in my universe . If we can work together ... Work together ? Are you an Arog 'ian ? That 's not relevant . Arif Carpet-Rugs-Travel .

I 'll take the tools as well . Nothing else has been made with these tools , right ? No Kaarga . I hear that you 're making cave paintings . Is that correct ? No Kaarga . There 's nothing like that . - You 're make hunting tools , spears and such ? - We only pick fruit . Do not pick anything . Only eat the fallen ones . You 're destroying the village . The children are starving . You wont even let us light fires . We 're going to freeze to death in the caves . Dimi ! Tell your monkey-faced daughter to stop babbling otherwise her tongue will be number 42 . Tools are for the one job only ! I 'll burn anyone that makes new things ! Be a man , provide your service .

Don 't forget it , because we have a connection there . - Walk ! - Okay . - Wheel ? - No my master . Shhh ! Where will you go with this wheel ? - It 's not a wheel , it 's a mill stone . - Liar ! Master , I 'm a farmer . We use this to grind wheat . You 're lying ! Didn 't we also ban farming ? - Take him away . He 's off to the tower tomorrow . - Master , please forgive me .

Be a warrior . You 're drawing on the walls . Don 't waste your time on such things . Dad , I love drawing . Sculpture , music , dance . I love them all . - Doesn 't it give the tribe colour ? - Lies ! You 're telling lies . They won 't understand you . They 'll make fun of you . They 'll see you as a tramp . You 'll die from your pain . Don 't be an artist , be a warrior . Don 't be suppressed , be the suppressor . My work will give future generations a light to follow . - Where are the prisoners ? - Below . Go and torment the prisoners . Go on my child . [ BREATHING DEEPLY ] Uncle , my medicine ... [ RATTLESNAKE SOUND ] Kaarga , you are to take responsibility for this child . I want him to be an Arog 'ian that our ancestors would be proud of . My father Kumo needs something to be proud of . Do not worry nephew . When we finish the tower and find him , it will be a new era for all of us . Dad , the heavens took you . I 'm going to bring you back from there . - My brother Kumo was also a friend . - His good intentions were his downfall ? [ NARRATOR 'S VOICE ] Many many years ago , at the beginning of the Stone Age we were poor but we were happy . Where groves now grow there was nothing . One day a circular metal object descended from the sky . Was it made from iron ? Maybe . There were two strange creatures but one that looked like us . They were laughing . They gave us a gift . Kumo , my father , didn 't have a suitable gift to offer back . He offered the first thing at hand . They were angry . They waved their hands , got back into the object and took off . Something really bad happened when Kumo tried to salute them . My father was no more . All of our ambition and passion comes from that gift . We kicked . We kicked . We kicked ! Since that day I have been against new things and inventions . Guys , this had better not be like that Mel Gibson film where heads get chopped off . Do the gods want a sacrificial lamb ? I really hate that . [ BARRACKING IN AROG ] Strong Men ! In a few moments you will ascend the tower . Whoever brings Big Kumo down will have their life spared . You will be given a new life along with some polished stones . Beautiful . We 'll be more advanced . Polished stones - super . Give them to me . Start the Strong Man dance . [ SHOUTING IN CHORUS ] Hey ! [ BARRACKING IN AROG ] Brother , there are two things that I really hate . Modern dance and primitive dance . They 're the most irritating things . No ! Don 't ! No ! Don 't ! Don 't hit me ! Don 't ! No ! No ! Don 't hit me ! No ! Cut it out ! Cut it out ! Move ! Move ! His heart is obviously tiny . You can 't even make a small tzatziki dip with it . Wait a minute . Mark me with the mud sister . I 'm off to bring the old brother back . - What about the dance ? - This place is like a school canteen now . I 'll bring him back , then we can dance until the crack of dawn . Don 't worry . Pick it up brothers . Pick it up . This is such a big rock ! - Who is that ? - His hair is peculiar . This is how we used to transport refrigerators . Hoppa ! [ STRUGGLING ] Kargabas , make sure you have the polished stones ready on my return . The feasibility of this is wrong . That is , it 's been built wrong . [ TENSE MUSIC ] I did a silent fart , but I don 't think it will reach them down there . Here we are . - Hello uncle . - Stay away from me . Kumo , are you Kumo ? There 's no meaning to life . There 's nothing for me at all ... Hey man ! What are you doing man ? I 'm here to take you back down . - I want to die . - Nonsense . Take this , take this cigarette . You can 't think like that . Why would you want to die ? Ridiculous . Life isn 't meaningless . Stop being ridiculous . Here . Cover it up with your hands . Cover it up . Like this , two hands . Cover it with your hands . Looks like cigarettes killed him . What 's it to me . They said place the rock and I did . I don 't care . - Someone 's coming . - Someone 's returning from the tower ! Someone 's returning from the tower ! Is it my father ? Is it my father ? I can 't quite see dad , do you want to try and see ? [ BARRACKING IN AROG ] Thanks a lot . Thanks a lot . Thank you to you . Nice girl . Quiet ! Did you see anyone ? Did you see Kumo ? I did . Now this is what happened ... He was all alone and isolated up there after his escape from his captors he was all shrivelled up . I 'm no psychologist so I wasn 't what to do I tried talking to him but he was like , such a like What I 'm saying is , he was like a hermit and as a result ... Tell me man . Where is Kumo ? Father ! Here he is . This isn 't Kumo . He 's an Arog 'ian . - How would I know ? I didn 't ask for ID ? - Take that necklace off his neck . Here , take it then . Take it . Like I really needed it . You went all the way to the summit and couldn 't find my father . Why ? To reach the heavens , how many more stones do we need ? It 's so easy for you to talk from over there . There are seven more levels before you reach the sky . Do you think I 'm a construction worker that 's going to build up to the stratosphere ? Lies ! You are lying ! We 'll continue building the tower tomorrow . Kaaya is upset . The ceremony is over . Back to your business . - Kargabas . Am I part of the community now ? - Shut up . You 're the first person to return from the tower alive . Eat and drink all you want . Your life has been spared in accordance with our customs . What a nice custom . Normally a man would die from your customs . Then let 's build a landing pad or something . What is this man ! 8 minutes have passed in my parallel universe . A little bit of help would be nice . - What sort of a community do you have here ? - Come . We need to make a picture of you . Stop brother , I have enough problems of my own . You 're the first person to ever return . I don 't want to miss this opportunity . - I 'm an artist but I paint in secret . - You have to paint in secret ? That 's how it has to be . Let 's go to my studio . Brother , my name is Arif . I 'm a practical man . I wouldn 't put up with the pressure of this feudal system . That 's just my character . A little less movement . Hold still . Let me see how you 're doing . - What 's that ? Is that what my nose looks like ? - It 's the same . Look at that drawing . Did you draw that ? - That 's my style , my genre . - Nice . Sign your name there . Encyclopaedias credit Anonymous as drawing them . Don 't be simple-minded . Let 's slap an Arif here . - What are you up to brother ? - Sign them son . These are beautiful . - How much are the masks ? - They 're not for sale . They 're for me . But it 's a secret . I don 't want my father to hear . Does your father understand art ? Art is for society . Why hide it ? They won 't understand it either . Look , give this one a little smile and make this one a little sad . - This one is laughing , look . - That 's how much the oppressor laughs . - This would make a great coat . - No brother . Please don 't ! Wow . Stepping a little out of your genre . Isn 't that the girl from the village ? - Yes . Mimi . - Is it a crush ? - I love her man . - You were making fun of her in the village . Repressive society . That 's nothing . You should see this . - Wow . Who did that ? - I did . Yourself ? You are in love my friend . So you have to listen carefully .

[ IN A HIGH PITCHED VOICE ] I know that much . - My voice isn 't high pitched . - If I say draw a picture , you 'll draw it . " Can you draw the football game ? I can . " A ball game . That 's for Arog 'ians . What would we know ? I actually said ping-pong . This hairy tailed idiot said ball game . How about this six a side game . You use your foot to kick the ball ? I 'm saying that we are free if we win . Cuhara is the only one who knows the Arog 'ian ball game . Cuhara . We 're playing ball with the Arog 'ians . You want to play ? I 've left that stuff behind . I pass . [ ANGRILY ] Aaah ! You all play Kesanli Ali Destani in the middle of your village . We 're not producing a musical here ? [ IN A HIGH PITCHED VOICE ] " They 're crushing us . Crushing us . " Give it a little bit of effort . - Their voices aren 't that high pitched . - Wait a minute . Why isn 't he playing ? Cuhara was the Arog 'ian goal keeper . He quit after letting 8 goals in . Eight goals ? I 'm not surprised he found the raki . - I 'll play . - No Mimi . You can 't play . - The men are very rough . - So we 're doing nothing then ? I 'm not discriminating but you and the girls need to sew our uniforms . Okay . I 'll be the goalie because I can 't run much . Beautiful ! Taso and I will be the forwards . Isn 't there anyone else . Three more young players ? Put your hand down Uncle Teoman . Look here you .

Give it to me child . Gentlemen , this is football . Like every civilised society , we must treat the game with respect . This is our time . Our competitors are good but we also have weapons .

The goal is as important as your eyes . Have a lemon . [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] We have a bad goalkeeper so I expect a lot from you . Bad ! [ SPEAKING IN AROG ] We can 't play like this ! Meto , every ball you save throw it to me . Now get in over here , let me see . That 's it , like this . You have to mark that psychopath in the middle . This guy is a maniac . This guy is going to be on our side ... My father wont trade him , he has another two years . Open it up , on the inside ! Your crosses are very good . We flow well together . Did he get it in ? [ CELEBRATING THE GOAL ] Take this Meto . - Dimi . 42 . - Well done ! Taso . Can we win Arif ? They may be better than us but there is one thing they forget . The crowd . The spectators . [ ALL SPEAKING TOGETHER ] Oooooo ! One , two , three ! Solid as a rock , solid as a rock . Straight up ! Straight up ! We 're off to lay the Arog 'ians . Ooooo . He 's coming , he 's coming .

We broke the spell ! [ SHOUTING IN JOY ] [ SCREAMING IN FEAR ] Don 't let it get you down . Don 't act spoilt . Come on . [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] It 's my fault . Pick someone else if you want . What 's that got to do with it ? They 're not human . Look at him . I have some amazing moves but I promised never to use them . Get me some bread . If we break some bread over my head then I 'll be able to use the special moves that Garavel taught me . - Who is Garavel ? - Break this over my head . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] We asked you to be a supportive crowd . Where 's our audience ? [ CROWD STARTS CHEERING ] Solid as a rock , solid as a rock . Straight up ! Straight up !

Well done ! Come on . It 's a lie . That 's someone else . Get stuffed . It 's a stunt double . Did you expect he 'd do it himself ? Cuhara . - Are we ready to score Taso ? - We 're ready to score Arif . [ WILD SHOUTING ] I 've saved this goal in honour of this civilization . We 'll make this goal . [ SHOUTING ] Goal ! [ CLAPPING ] [ CROWD BARRACKING ] Arog ! Arog ! Arif ? Good game . Here , this is for you . Thank you , but my work manipulating time is now finished . We won Arif . We are free now . In the name of my Arog brothers , I am proud and overjoyed . I am at the end of the road now Taso . - What are you talking about Arif ? - I didn 't come here of my own free will . I was forced . I intended to find a time machine and return to my wife and child . But I didn 't succeed . But now everything is allowed Arif . We can make things happen . We can 't make things happen . We can use a knife and a fork . This is something , but not enough . Also , approximately 30 minutes has elapsed in the parallel universe . Logar has long since taken my wife to Gora . - What are you going to do then ? - I don 't know . If I stay here , I 'll have to lose myself in the desert so I don 't interfere with time . No matter . At least I got to meet the people I saw in the Encyclopaedia . None of your names were shown . But isn 't that always the way ? - Mimi , Taso , Cuhara , Kaarga , Dimi . - Yes , Arif ? The books show you as being bent and twisted . They show you to be like monkeys . What a lie that is . [ SHAKING IN FEAR ] Maybe we didn 't evolve from monkeys , but we sure are evolving to monkeys . Arif , please don 't forget us - your brothers and sisters . I 'm not asking for a statue , but a nice cave painting of me would be good . I 'm worth as much as a bull , aren 't I Taso ? [ CRYING ] - Let me through . I commend you Taso . I would never have known how well you played football . You 've taught us a lot Arif . Don 't leave . Please stay with us . I 've also learnt many things from you but I must go . Taso , come here . Here is your wedding present . An imitation Rolex , but it 's a perfect replica . Mimi , this is my wedding ring . My wife 's name is engraved on the inside . Have it . Just keep making advancements . Okay then , bye bye . Or should I say , in your language ... [ SPEAKING AROG ] [ REPLYING IN AROG ] [ SIZZLING SOUND ] Oh my goodness ! Ceku ! - Arif ! - Ceku , I can 't believe this . My honey . Ceku . She came . My wife came . Ceku . How did you find me ? Arif , the whole world is talking about you . About me ? How is that ? When you went to look at the starship with Logar , I jumped on the Internet . [ NEWS READER ] A million years old but still young . A mystery in Afyon-Turkey . " Ceku , you are mine or I belong to the earth " , has been written in perfect latin alphabet . As you can see , there is a clear and positive " Arif " word visible here . 1 MILLION YEAR OLD GRAFFITI IS FROM OUR TIME ! WHO IS THIS ARIF ? CEKU ARIF [ TELEVISION ] The results of carbon testing at the Afyon archaeological site shows that the finds are between 500 thousand to 1 million years old . The cave writings have deeply shaken up the scientific world . On the walls , the name " Arif " is neatly written and can be easily seen . Among the artefacts is a wedding band with " Ceku " engraved on it . The world is confused . Right then , I knew Logar had tricked you with one of his games . When the doorbell rang , I was ready . The idiot had lost a contact lens and . his hair was parted the wrong way . I told him that he couldn 't copy my hairstyle . Arif ! Thank you my friends . My wife and I should go before the machine cools down . I 'll send you a wedding present once I get back . We 'll send one . - Arif ? - I 'm Logar , Commander Logar . - I come from the heavens . - From the heavens ? [ GROUND BREAKING SOUND ]

 In the future , a computer program called Skynet will declare war on the human race . Machines have traveled back in time , taking human form to terminate John Connor , the future leader of the Resistance ; Sarah Connor , John 's mother , teacher , and protector ; Cameron , a terminator reprogrammed to defend them at all costs ; Derek Reese , John 's uncle , and a commanding officer with the Resistance . Together they fight to stop Skynet from ever being created . The battle for our tomorrow starts today . Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles He 's from the future . Sent here by John . Stop Greenway ... Serrano Point ... He 's concerned about one of the censor board in the control room . The reactor could melt down . Skynet wins . The reactor is overheating . My name is Catherine Weaver . I 'd like to talk to you about a job opportunity , agent Ellison . This is Riley . Now is not the time for this . So when is the time ... to live my life ? Martin Bedell ? His name was Martin Bedell . He was in Century work camp with you . Right up until the escape . So I knew him . You knew him . Everybody knew him . But he doesn 't know this one , does he ? Not this Martin Bedell . No . Another Martin Bedell . Maybe it 's just coincidence . How many coincidences named Sarah Connor got killed , before Skynet finally locked in on you ? So why would they want to kill him ? He had experience and knowledge that John needed . Military prep school , then West Point . Bedell had real training . He helped John put the Resistance together . Okay . There were three Martin Bedells in L.A. Now there are two . So how do we know which one is the target ? They both are . Machines are thorough . Only good thing about them . So it took you , what , 30 seconds to find those names ? If there is a triple-eight out there , he 's found them too . Where are you going ? Martin Bedell number one . Closest address . Without a plan ? Yeah , I 've got a plan . It involves guns . Wait . You 're not going with him . No . Everybody , wait . P. Alto . We thought it was a person . It 's not , it 's a place . It 's a military prep school in Carlsbad . Here 's the student directory . Martin Bedell number two . Maybe we got a head start . I 'll load the truck . We 'll go . We will , will we ? It 's a boys ' school . I can do this . I am doing this . Nothing complicated . Find the kid , throw him in a hole , babysit . It 's as safe as anything we do . Go . Two . Two Sarah Connors were murdered before they found me . Cameron and I will find the other Martin Bedell . Maybe we can stop the triple-eight before he gets to you . He 's not a soldier . No . Not yet . You haven 't said a word since Anaheim . That 's 40 miles of quiet . You are ... thinking or worrying ? Thinking . About Bedell . After we grab him , where are we supposed to hide him ? Who said we were going to hide him ? Martin Bedell hiding in a cave somewhere might as well be Martin Bedell dead somewhere . No use to John Connor . Besides , it 's a military school . Soldiers , guns , can 't do much better than that . So you own this nuclear plant , Serrano Point ? I have an interest in it . Is this the same company you were referring to the other day ? The one you wanted me to look into ? It is . The near-meltdown a few weeks back ... The news said an employee caused the accident . Mr. Ellison , there are no accidents . Kansas , this is Hammerhead . Do you copy ? - Kansas , respond ! - It 's Kyle . He 's back . Tin cans just hit Kansas bunker . Survivors ? Prisoners now . One ogre tank , three monkey wagons . The convoy will roll out ... down Wilshire to Century in the next hour . And I 'm thinking- - No , uh-uh . We 've got our orders . Connor wants this corridor controlled . So we sit tight , we observe Skynet movement , and we 'll report back at regular intervals , and that 's it . What 's that report going to say ? That we observed Skynet move these people into a death camp while we sat ? I know ! I know it sucks , all right ? But if we lose eyes on this road , we could lose a lot more than one bunker , Kyle . If Connor were here- - Connor isn 't here . Corporal , get below . Round up every tunnel rat you can find . Martin . You know what he 'd say . You know what Connor would say . Yes , I know what he 'd say . If Connor wants to shoot me for disobeying orders , he can get in line behind the tin cans . We 're doing this . You all right ? We see a lot of boys like your nephew , lieutenant . Single mother . Socially withdrawn . Move around a lot . Tend to cling to male authority figures . Lost his dad , you said , in the war ? Killed . On a mission . Can 't tell you any more than that . Don 't know ? Can 't . I understand . Well ... Good grades . Good test scores . Good kid . Here 's what I 'll do . Three weeks as a plebe . If he likes it , he can stay . Then we 'll talk tuition . Thank you . I 'll give him the news . Lieutenant . I lost one of my tacs a couple weeks ago . Reservist . Had to go . Tac . Teacher-advisor . They keep the cadets from going all lord of the flies on us . Hired a replacement , but he 's not due for a week . I 'm shorthanded . Sir ... respectfully , I 'm probably the last guy you 're looking for . Guys like you get dropped into the ass end of nowhere . You can handle 30 adolescents for a week . Good news . You 're in . And what 's the bad news ? I 'm in . Man up , nube ! You don 't want to get owned . Stop crying about your internet connection , and learn to play . I got to e.f.k. , man . Martin Bedell ? Yes ? Come on , let 's go . Hurry up ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Drive . You good ? You okay ? Seatbelt . Who is that man ? He should be dead . How come he 's not dead ? And where 's my mom ? No more questions . Your mother 's current location is unknown . That man is a cyborg sent to kill you . Cameron ! Get your seatbelt on . I don 't care about the reports , Mr. Nelson , I know what they say . What I don 't know is ... what really happened . People who wrote that report are bureaucrats . You know what bureaucrats do when the facts ... don 't fit their little checkboxes ? Ignore them . Or change them . So this valve supposedly blew open because of metal fatigue ? Sure . Okay . Not likely , but let 's grant mother nature that one . So how in the hell did it force itself closed ? Okay . How strong do you have to be , to force it open and push it back ? On a scale of one to ten ? Superman . Report says this damage was caused by a transformer explosion . You want to see what the security tapes say ? There are no tapes . - They 're gone . - That they are . And who took those ? Carl Greenway , on the way to hanging himself ? Those mystery employees who shut the reactor down ? You ask the same questions I would . Putting together a report for the NRC . They 're going to crawl up this place 's ass with a wire brush . It 's going to play hell with the schedule . Schedule ? What schedule is that ? August 2009 . New automated system comes online ... and we 're back in business . That 's what they say . Of course , that ain 't going to happen if the feds are on a war path . - You jammed ? - Yeah . You know sports ? Like wrestling ? No , it 's a mnemonic . Sports . S-P-O-R-T-S . May I ? All right . So you want to slap . Pull . Observe . Release . Tap . Shoot . All right . Thanks , plebe . You 're welcome , I think . Baum . I 'm cadet captain Martin Bedell . Commandant asked me to keep an eye on you . Prep you for O.C.C. What 's this ? It 's a merit ... for squaring away Pyle . And that 's a demerit . Next time you have a problem , flag down a senior cadet or an instructor . You run , Baum ? I love to run . You look ate up . Oh , no . This is great . Yeah . Imagine how it 's going to be with a marine D.I. screaming at you . Like everything 's life and death . I can imagine . That the new tac ? Good ambush point . In case you 're looking for one . Or in case you choose to jog in the woods . By yourself . You should be careful . Of that , too . It 's tar . La brea . It 's everywhere . That stuff smells terrible . It smells like- - Jet fuel . So ... You 're out here jogging , in the open , Exposed , with ... Bedell . I 've heard a lot about you . A lot of good , I hope , sir . Lot of good . So when do I get to call my mom ? When it 's safe . When 's that ? Soon . Do you do this every night ? Yeah . Well , what happens when you go to sleep ? She happens . Let 's find you something to wear for bed . Something in here should fit you . Try these . This is too small . How do you know ? Just try them . They 're for a five-year-old . How ' bout this ? Uh , that 's for playing soccer . Uh , this isn 't your stuff . Is it ? No . It 's not our stuff . I want to call my mom . She was supposed to get me a book . For my book report . If you call your mother , that man will use her to find you . Then he 'll kill her . He 'll kill you . Uh , Cameron . Would you like a bedtime story ? We made a tactical error . We should have engaged the triple-eight . With a little boy in the crossfire ? The boy is not important . He is not our mission . He is now . It 's just a meet and greet , sir . Say hi . Ask them how they 're holding up . Then company dismissed . It 's easy . Oh , they 're probably going to want to ask you about O.C.C. prep weekend . We take the juniors through field exercises . Obstacle courses , simulated missions . Running around in the woods , you know ? It 'll be fun . Fun . Hi , I 'm lieutenant Baum . I 'm your new tac . So I 've been told ... that my job is to make sure that you 're all doing okay . Well , you all look okay to me . So , um ... Any questions ? All right , then . Sir . We heard you were in the war . Heard you seen action . Yeah . Yeah , I 've seen action in the war . Got a lot of kills ? Say again ? Kills , sir . I want to go infantry as soon as I get out of here . Maybe Rangers . Maybe Delta . Best of the best . Best of the best . Counting kills . Like it 's a game . Like it 's just a game . I remember one particularly fun day . A guy in my squad ... got his stomach blasted open in a fire fight . He spent six hours holding his own guts in . His buddy carried him on his back to the nearest aide station , just praying that someone could put the dumb son of a bitch together again . The game , Pyle , the game is played with your buddy 's life . With the life of your squad . Your platoon . The game is played by you . On behalf of the whole damn human race . Meet my friend , the e.f.p. He sits in the middle of the road and blows up metal . This is his life 's ambition . I intend to help him achieve it . We 've seeded the street with these things . We got to make sure that ogre cooperates . Corporal Reese will take you and set up over at Lacma and the page . When the convoy rolls to your position , open fire ... on this bunker . The ogre will think it 's metal on skin and move to assist . And when it does , boom . Questions ? Move out . They 're kids . They key off of you . I know . Your uncle ... He 's an intense guy . Yeah , I know . He 's a good guy , though . He 's just--he 's a lot to take sometimes . All that he 's been through . You know ... What are you supposed to say to that ? You mean , how do you measure up ? Every man in my family , going back five generations , has been a general or statesman , CEO , something amazing . They all went here . But you know what the best part about Presidio Alto is ? The cross-country course . You know , sometimes when I 'm out there- - when I 'm all alone , and I 'm going flat-out- - everything just , sort of , falls away . But sometimes , I wish that ... Wish you could just keep on running and never look back . I met this girl over the summer . Her name is Alicia . She 's amazing , dude . She started at Dartmouth this year . She 's a runner like me . She 's coming home in a couple of weeks . When she goes back , I think I want to go with her ... and never look back . That 's a secret , Baum . You treat it as such . I always do . I was just on the roof . There 's flat terrain all around , but , uh , the woods are a problem . When the triple-eight comes , that 's where it 'll come from . You 're alone and exposed here . It 's not good . And you 're going to tell me I know better . Bedell is quitting . Leaving school . No , he isn 't . He won 't . Well , he is . He doesn 't . He graduates . Goes to West Point . Why ? Because the future already happened , and ... he 's just going through the motions ? He doesn 't have a choice ? He 's got a choice . We 've just got to help him make the right one . Like everybody does with me . There are three exits within 20 meters , two of them lead to a parking lot . There 's a black hatchback , three cars with the doors unlocked , and the keys above the visor . I do know better . We 're begging you . Be merciful and keep our son safe . Marty , if you can hear this , We 're going to get you back . - Your dad and I love- - - Turn that off ! What the hell were you thinking , letting him watch that ? He wanted to see his mother . You all right ? I told you people . And I told you I had to get it done by Monday . And it 's Friday already . And I haven 't even started , and I 'm already in trouble , And when you don 't do it , the teacher makes you stand up in front of the whole class ! Marty , slow down . You 're hyperventilating . There . Take a breath . Tell me what this is about . I told you . My book report . Book report ? Yeah . It 's due by Monday . And I haven 't even picked out a book yet . Don 't you listen ? Let 's find you one . There 's got to be something for you somewhere . It was John 's favorite . Who 's John ? The machine won 't stop . He 'll go back to that kid 's house , find his parents , find his mom . I would . The police 'll be there by now . Police won 't matter . I know . You don 't need to be here . There are other places to be . You want me to protect his parents ? I want you to keep this contained . Something you need , officer ? Good eye . Job requirement . Right . Private sector . Looking into the plant accident . When Carl Greenway went nuts ? Yeah . When Carl Greenway went nuts . I understand he used to come in here . They all do . Including Carl . Sit right where you 're sitting . Drink alone . Drink a lot ? Tonic water . Like you , I bet . Was he alone like me ? Pretty much every night . I don 't know why the guy came in here at all . Still , I do remember some hottie chatting him up at the bar the night before everything went down at the power plant . Probably one of Sandy 's friends . Sandra runs H.R. at the plant . Her birthday party that night , I got pictures . May I ? Find who you 're looking for ? Actually , quite the opposite . These going to kill it ? No , a speed bump . That 's all . Now , this ... Raufoss . Mark 211 round . Tungsten core , armor piercing . High explosive incendiary . Hits with the force of a 20 millimeter cannon . Saw your dad take down an h-k with one of those . He liked it better than his plasma rifle . So this is going to kill it . It 'll make it stop . Reconsider its life choices . That soldier ... The one you talked about in your story . My dad carried him to that aid station , didn 't he ? Yeah . He spent a whole night in the bunker , trying to get the blood out of his fatigues . You know what 's funny ? I saw a deer the other day . It made me think of him . We were together the last time I saw one . Before Judgment Day ? No . After . We were up in Griffith Park , hunting for food . It was a big bastard too . Your dad had never seen one before . I mean , not like that . After I killed it and we got close ... Your dad started crying . You know , more than I 'd ever heard or seen him . I didn 't know how to make him stop . I buried the deer . We went hungry . He was just a boy . So were you . Yep . I guess I was . You see how the metal is twisted ? You can have the Steelers ' entire offensive line ... tugging ' on that valve ... and not generate enough force to do that . So you agree it was a machine , as I thought . Two machines . One machine ripped the valve open , and I 'm guessing ... the other closed it . And I 'm pretty sure there was a fight between them . Two machines . This is new . Where did they come from ? Why did they fight ? Um , I wish I knew . I wish any of this made sense . I do know I 'm not the only one asking questions . The plant manager , Nelson ... He wants the NRC to investigate . It 'll be a nightmare . That will complicate our respective goals , won 't it , James ? What would those respective goals be ? I 'd like my company to lead the world into the next century . And I 'm fairly sure you 're an avenging angel . So let 's keep looking ... before the nightmare begins . Last one . Hey , it 's for my heart . You never heard of the french paradox ? Those frogs eat foie gras , and gargle red wine . They live till they 're 90 . Yeah , but it 's the chemicals in the grape skins that do it . Well , uh ... Bonjour . Resvera ... something . I saw it on 60 minutes . You don 't say . You 're so beautiful . Sorry , Alicia . That 's never happened before . Don 't worry , sweetie . I bet that never happened before , either . The FBI has moved Marty 's parents . And the triple-eight ? He 's made no attempt to acquire them . So what would you do now ? In your professional robot opinion . Marty 's trail has gone cold . I 'd switch targets to the other Martin Bedell . So go to the other Martin Bedell 's house . Wait for the triple-eight . When it shows up , blow its head off . He can put it back on . Marty likes the crust cut off . Here you go . My teacher doesn 't like us to pick books that have been made into movies . She thinks we 'll just cheat and watch the movie instead . You 'd be in big trouble if you did . The movie is pretty different than the book . Really ? How ? Well , the slippers aren 't ruby . They 're silver . And there are two good witches , not one . And Dorothy 's not 16 , she 's nearer your age . Smart and brave . If that guy finds me , he 's really going to kill me . He won 't touch you . I promise . Baum . How are you holding up ? Shouldn 't you be digging a tunnel outta here or something ? I 'm not just going to skip out on my buddies . I owe them this much . Not everybody gets to run away , you know . Pick up the pace , Baum . I 'm not going to carry you up this hill . Triple-eight has been to that kid 's house . It knows about the school . It has his picture . How long ? Cameron says two , maybe three hours . She 's on her way . You told me , throw that kid in a hole . Babysit . Nothing complicated . It won 't touch him . I won 't let it . You 'd better not . 'cause if you do , pray that triple-eight gets to you before I do . Is , uh- - is everything okay ? Everything 's fine . Look , I 'm sorry . I didn 't- - I didn 't mean this . This was never the plan , ever . What was the plan ? I don 't know . You can 't always have one . Not all the time . Sometimes you just do . And I did . To you . Well ... You saved my life , right ? So ... good plan . Thank you . I said thank you . I know . I just ... I haven 't heard that in ... I haven 't heard that . You 're welcome ? Say it . You 're welcome . Now say , " Marty ... let me help you with your book report . " I can 't call my mom and ... You 're not doing anything . So ... Thank you , Marty . You 're welcome . Tonight 's exercise is a rescue extraction . Meet old Fred . He weighs about 75 pounds , and needs to be carried from place to place . This is his life 's ambition . And I intend to help him- - Forget that ! All eyes on me . Seniors ... Get your people online . Ten meter spacing . Eyes up . What about the obstacle course ? New exercise . A guy with a gun is going to come through here . Do not initiate contact . Not even for laughs . Are we clear ? You see him , you send a hand signal up the line . If I see that hand signal before I see our infiltrator , you win . Exercise over . And where will you be ? Looking for that hand signal . You 're with me . You too . Those are detonators . Claymore simulators . Here , here , and here . Now you wait for the signal . You watch for me to lead the infiltrator past this line . When he enters the kill zone , you hit the detonator , simulators go off . End of story . We go home . Wait , sir . The last-minute change of mission ? Pre-positioned equipment ? Claymore simulators ? What ? We 're not having fun ? Aw , son of a bitch ! No , no , no , no ! Aw ! Got to be a little more specific . Straight shot from one of the kids must 've . Must 've hit one of the f-p 's . It 's set them all off , it 's a chain reaction . We 're just swinging in the wind . Where 's the ogre ? It 's coming to kill us all . Where the hell do you think it is ? Where is the tank ? About a block away . Moving towards us . There 's no way we 've got enough powder to kill it . I 'm going to lay down some covering fire . Maybe drop a couple endos . That 'll give Kyle enough time to get back . Reese ... We can kill that ogre . We got one more magic bullet . We just got to get it out there . The emerald city was soon left far behind . As they advanced , the ground became rougher and hillier . For there were no farms nor houses in this country of the west . Before night , Dorothy , and Toto , and the lion lay down upon the grass and fell asleep , with the woodman and the scarecrow keeping watch . Now , the wicked witch had but one eye , yet she could see everywhere . She saw Dorothy lying asleep , with her friends all about her . The wicked witch looked out with her one eye , she said to the king crow , 'Fly at once to those strangers , 'peck out their eyes , 'tear them to pieces . ' The wild crows flew in one great flock , toward Dorothy and her companions . When the little girl saw them coming , she was afraid . Come here . But the scarecrow said , 'This is my battle , 'lie down beside me and you will not be harmed . ' Hey ! Look over here ! It 's me ! Connor ! John Connor ! The witch got into a terrible rage . She couldn 't understand how all her plans to destroy the strangers had failed . There was only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends . Want me to read for awhile ? The sky darkened and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air . There was a rushing of many wings , a great chattering and laughing , and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys . 'Go to the strangers and destroy them all , ' said the wicked witch . But Dorothy they did not harm at all . Careful and gently , they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried her to the witch . The witch looked into the child 's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was , and that she did not know of her wonderful power . The witch said to Dorothy , 'Come with me ; 'for if you do not , I will make an end of you . ' The little girl grew angry . 'You are a wicked creature ! ' she cried . In her anger , she picked up a bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the witch , wetting her from head to foot . The witch gave a cry of fear . As Dorothy looked in wonder , the witch began to shrink away . 'See what you have done ! ' the witch screamed . 'I shall melt away . ' With these words , she fell into a melted shapeless mess . The wicked witch had come to an end . Being at last free to do as she chose , Dorothy ran , no longer a prisoner in a strange land . Six stops down , there 's a pay phone to call your mom . You got your money ? If you get into trouble , you call me . Say " book report " and I 'll come . Whatever it is , I 'll come . Are you a spy ? No , I 'm not a spy . Are you a mom ? Yeah , I 'm a mom . You kind of suck at it . I know . I 'm working on it . Let 's catch your bus . So this ... This is what I 'm supposed to do ? Stay here , graduate , go to West Point ? Like I don 't know the end of the world is coming ? Like any of this- - any of it really matters ? It does matter . It all matters . You believe that ? I 've got to . I 'll see you around , Connor . Yeah . I guess you will . Sometimes I wish ... I could just wake up from all this . Like from a dream . But I can 't , can I ? You want to know what happened ... to Bedell- - what really happened ? I don 't know , do I ? Guess it depends on who I 'm talking to . John Baum or John Connor . Baum is just a name . I 'll go . Reese , I run faster than you . You run like a duck . You 'll never make it . He 's my brother . You want to save Kyle , or die trying ? Give me the damn e.f.p. Please . I want to take this one . Run like hell , okay ? Bedell , you run like hell . When this thing goes off , you pop those wagons . You get those people out . Don 't be a hero . Go ! And he ran . He ran so fast . Fast enough to get to that tank before it got to Kyle 's position . Fast enough to blow it sky-high . We rescued 40 prisoners that day . One of them was John Connor . Martin was always a great runner . But no one ... No one could outrun a blast like that . He died , John . He died for you . We all die for you .

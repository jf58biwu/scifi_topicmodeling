 I feel like you 're driving me to court martial . This is crazy . What did I do ? I feel like you 're gonna pull over and snuff me . What , you 're not allowed to talk ? Hey , Forest ... - We can talk , sir . - Oh , I see . So it 's personal ? No , you intimidate them . Dear God , you 're a woman ! I honestly , I couldn 't have called that . I mean , I would apologize , but isn 't that what we 're going for here ? I thought of you as a soldier first . - I 'm an airman . Well you have actually excellent bone structure there . I 'm kinda ... having a hard time not looking at you now . Is that weird ? C 'mon , it 's OK , laugh . Hey ! - Sir , I have a question to ask . - Yes , please . It is true you went 12-for-12 with last year 's Maxim cover models ? That is an excellent question . Yes and no . March and I had a scheduling conflict , but fortunately the Christmas cover was twins . Anything else ? You 're kidding me with a hand up , right ? Is it cool if I take a picture with you ? Yes , it 's very cool . I don 't wanna see this on your MySpace page . Please , no gang signs . No , throw it up , I 'm kidding . Yeah , peace ! I love peace . I 'd be outta job with peace . C 'mon ! Just click it , don 't change the settings , just click it . What 's going on ? Jimmy , stay with Stark ! Lie down ! Son of a bitch ! - Wait , wait , give me a gun ! - Stay here ! Tony Stark . Visionary . Genius . American patriot . Even from an early age , the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind . At age four , he built his first circuit board . At age six , his first engine . And at seventeen , he graduated Summa Cum Laude from MIT . Then , the passing of a titan . Howard Stark 's life long friend and ally Obadiah Stane , steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder . Until at age 21 , the prodigal son returns , and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries . With the keys to the kingdom , Tony ushers in a new era for his father 's legacy , creating smarter weapons , advanced robotics , satellite targeting . Today , Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry , by ensuring freedom and protecting America and her interests around the globe . As liaison to Stark Industries , I 've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot . He is my friend and he is my great mentor . Ladies and gentlemen , it is my honor to present this year 's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark ! Tony ? Thank you , Colonel . This is beautiful . Thank you . Thank you all very much . This is wonderful . Well , I 'm not Tony Stark . But if I were Tony I would tell you how honored I feel , and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award . Tony , you know , the best thing about Tony is also the worst thing - he 's always working . C 'mon ! We should just stay till the morning . - You are unbelievable ! - Oh , no . They roped you into this ? Nobody roped me into anything . But they told me ... that if I presented you with an award , you 'd be deeply honored . Of course I 'd be deeply honored . And it 's you ! That 's great . So when do we do it ? One more round . - There you go . There it is . That was easy . I 'm so sorry . - Yeah , it 's OK . Wow , would you look at that ? That 's ... that 's something else . I don 't have any of those swooping around . All right , ride ! Give me a hand , will you ? OK , you too . I don 't blow on man 's hands . There it is ! It 's the Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes ' roll , and ... That 's what happens . Worse things have happened , I think we 're gonna be fine . Color me up , will you ? - This is where I exit . - Tomorrow don 't be late . - Yeah , you can count on it . - I 'm serious . - I know , I know . Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar 's . There you go . Mr. Stark ! Excuse me ! Mr. Stark ! Christine Everheart , Vanity Fair magazine . Can I ask you a couple of questions ? - She 's cute . - She 's alright ? Hi . - Hi . Yeah . Okay , go . You 've been called the Da Vinci of our time . What do you say to that ? Absolutely ridiculous . I don 't paint . And what do you say to your other nickname , the Merchant of Death ? That 's not bad . Let me guess ... Berkeley ? Brown , actually . Well , Ms. Brown . It 's an imperfect world , but it 's the only one we 've got . I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace , we 'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals . Rehearse that much ? Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime . - I can see that . - I 'd like to show you firsthand . All I want is the serious answer . Okay , here is serious . My old man had a philosophy : " Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy . " That 's a great line , coming from a guy selling the sticks . My father helped defeat Nazis . He worked on the Manhattan Project . A lot of people , including your professors at Brown , would call that being a hero . And a lot of people would also call that war-profiteering . Tell me , do you plan to report on the millions we 've saved by advancing medical technology ? Or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops ? All those breakthroughs : military funding , honey . Wow , did you ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life ? I 'd be prepared to lose a few with you . Good morning . It 's 7 a.m. The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds . The surf conditions are fair with waist to shoulder highlines , high tide will be at 10 : 52 a.m. Tony ? Hey , Tony ! You are not authorized to access this area . - Jesus ! That 's Jarvis , he runs the house . I 've got your clothes here , they 've been dry cleaned and pressed . And there 's a car waiting for you outside that will take you anywhere you 'd like to go . You must be the famous Pepper Potts . - Indeed I am . After all these years , Tony still has you picking up the dry cleaning ? I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires . Including occasionally taking out the trash . Would that be all ? Give me the exploded view . The compression in cylinder 3 appears to be low . Note that . - I 'll try again later ... - Please don 't turn down my music . I 'll keep you posted . You are supposed to be half way around the world right now . - How did she take it ? - Like a champ . Might 've tried to hustle me out of here . Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago . That 's funny ... I thought with it being my plane and all , that it would just wait for me to get there . I need to speak to you about couple of things before I get you outta the door . I mean , doesn 't it kind of defeat the purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive ? Larry called , he 's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings , do you want it , yes or no ? Is it a good representation of his Spring Period ? No the " Springs " is actually the neighborhood in East Hampton , where he lived and worked , not " spring " like the season . I think it 's a fair example ... I think it 's incredibly overpriced . I need it . Buy it , store it . Okay ... the MIT commencement speech . Is in June ... please , don 't harangue me about that stuff . Well , they are haranguing me , so I 'm gonna say yes ... I need you to sign this before you get on the plane . What are you trying to get rid of me for ? What , you got plans ? - As a matter of fact , I do . - I don 't like it when you have plans . I 'm allowed to have plans on my birthday . It 's your birthday . - Yes . - I knew that . Already ? Yeah , isn 't that strange , it 's the same day as last year . Well , get yourself something nice from me . - I already did . - And ? - Oh , it was very nice . Very tasteful . Thank you , Mr. Stark . You 're welcome , Ms. Potts . You 're good ! I thought I 've lost you back there . You did , sir . I took it across Mojave . - Ah , I gotcha , I gotcha . What 's wrong with you ? - What ? Three hours ! - I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair . Three hours . For three hours , you got me standing here . I 'm waiting on you now . Lets go . C 'mon . Wheels up ! Rock and roll ! What 're you reading ? - Nothing . C 'mon , sourpatch , don 't be mad . I told you I 'm not mad , I 'm indifferent , okay ? - I said I was sorry . - Good morning , Mr. Stark . - No need to apologize . - I told him I was sorry but he ... I 'm just indifferent right now . You don 't respect yourself , so I know you don 't respect me . - I respect you . - I 'm just your babysitter , and so , when you need your diaper changed , thank you ... let me know and I 'll get you a bottle , okay ? Hey , heat up the sake , will you ? Thanks for reminding me . I 'm not talking ... we 're not drinking , we 're working right now . And you are constitutionally incapable of being responsible . It would be irresponsible not to drink . I 'm just talking about the night cup . - Hot sake ? - Yes , two please . - No , just ... I 'm not drinking , I don 't want any . That 's what I 'm talking about . When I get up in the morning , and I 'm putting on my uniform , you know what I recognize ? I see in that mirror that every person that 's got this uniform will get my back ! - Here we go again . I 'm not like you . No , you don 't have to be like me . But you 're more than ... yes you are . Will you excuse me , I 'm a little bit distracted here . No , you can 't be distracted right now . Listen to me ! BAGRAM AIR BASE , AFGHANISTAN General . Welcome , Mr. Stark . We look forward to your weapons presentation . Is it better to be feared or respected ? And I say , is it too much to ask for both ? With that in mind , I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries freedom line . It 's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology . They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire . I respectfully disagree . I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once . That 's how dad did it , that 's how America does it ... and it 's worked out pretty well so far . Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain , and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won 't even want to come out of their caves . For your consideration , the Jericho . We throw one of these in with every purchase of 500 million or more . To peace ! - Tony . - Obie , what are you doing up ? I couldn 't sleep till I found out how it went . How did it go ? Went great , looks like it 's gonna be an early Christmas . Hey , way to go , my boy . I 'll see you tomorrow , yeah ? Why aren 't you wearing those pyjamas I got you ? Good night , Tony . Hey Tony ! I 'm sorry , this is the fun-vee . The hum-drum-vee is back there . - Nice job . - See you back at base . I wouldn 't do that if I were you . What the hell did you do to me ? What I did ? What I did is to save your life . I removed all the shrapnel I could , but there 's a lot left , and it 's headed into your atrial septum . Here , wanna see ? I have a souvenir . Take a look . I 've seen many wounds like that in my village . We call them the walking dead . Because in takes about a week for the balls to reach the vital organs . - What is this ? - That is an electromagnet . Hooked up to a car battery . And it 's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart . That 's right . Smile ! We met once , you know . At the technical conference in Bern . - Don 't remember . - No , you wouldn 't . If I had been that drunk , I wouldn 't have been able to stand , much less give a lecture on integrated circuits . Where are we ? Come on , stand up . Stand up . Do as I do . C 'mon , put your hands up . Those are my guns . How did they get my guns ? Do you understand me ? Do as I do . He says : " Welcome Tony Stark , the most famous mass murderer in the history of America . " He is honored . He wants you to build a missile . The Jericho missile that you demonstrated . This one . I refuse . Tony ! He wants to know what you think . I think he got a lot of my weapons . He says they have everything you need to build a Jericho missile . He wants you to make the list of materials . He says for you to start working immediately , and when you 're done , he will set you free . No , I won 't . No , he won 't . I 'm sure they 're looking for you , Stark . But they will never find you in these mountains . Look ... What you just saw ... that is your legacy , Stark . Your life 's work in the hands of those murderers . Is that how you want to go out ? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark ? Or are you going to do something about it ? Why should I do anything ? They 're gonna kill me , you ... Either way , if they don 't , I 'll probably be dead in a week . Well then ... this is a very important week for you , isn 't it ? If this is gonna be my workstation , I want it well lit , I want all of these tools . Welding gear , I don 't care if it 's acetylene or propane . I need a soldering station , I need helmets , I need goggles , I would like a smelting cup . I need two sets of precision tools . How many languages do you speak ? A lot . But apparently not enough for this place . They speak Arabic , Urdu , Dari , Pashto , Mongolian , Farsi , Russian . Who are these people ? They are your loyal customers , sir . They call themselves The Ten Rings . You know , we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process ? - Aha . Okay . We don 't need this . What is that ? That 's palladium , 0.15 grams . We need at least 1.6 , so why don 't you go break down the other eleven . What are they doing ? Working . Careful . Careful , we only get one shot at this . Relax , I 've steady hands . Why do you think you 're still alive , huh ? What do I call you ? - My name is Yinsen . - Yinsen ... nice to meet you . Nice to meet you too . Wow , that doesn 't look like a Jericho missile . That 's because it is a miniaturized Arc reactor . We got a big one powering my factory at home . It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart . But what could it generate ? If my math is right , and it always is ... three gigajoules per second . That could run your heart for the 50 lifetimes . - Yeah . Or something big for 50 minutes . This is our ticket outta here . - What is it ? 'Flying the mountain ' look . Impressive . Shesh Besh . Good roll . Good roll . You still didn 't tell me where you 're from . I 'm from a small town called Gulmira . It 's actually a nice place . - You got a family ? - Yes . And I will see them when I leave here . And you , Stark ? Nothing . No . So you 're a man who has everything ... and nothing . Doesn 't look anything like the photo . Maybe he modified it . - The tail doesn 't seem right . - Well , too bad . Relax . The bow and arrow once was the pinnacle of weapons technology . It allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine . An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great . And four times the size of the Roman empire . But today , whoever holds the latest Stark weapons , rules these lands . And soon it will be my turn . Why did you fail me ? We 're working on it . Diligently . I spared your life . Is this how you repay me ? It 's very complex . We 're trying hard . On your knees . You think I 'm an idiot ? Tell me the truth . We are working hard . Open your mouth . - What does he want ? - You think I 'm a fool ? What is going on ? Tell me the truth . We are working on Jericho . What do you want , a delivery date ? I need him . He 's a good assistant . You have till tomorrow to assemble my missile . - Okay ? - Yes . Can you move ? Say it again . 41 steps straight ahead , then 16 steps , left from the door , four to the right . 33 steps , turn right . Where is Stark ? He was here a moment ago . Go find him ! Yinsen ! Yinsen ! Stark ! Say something . He is speaking Hungarian , I don 't ... - Speak Hungarian . - Okay ... What do you know ? - How did that work ? - Oh my goodness . - It worked all right . - What do I do ? - Let me finish this . - Finish last powering sequence . Okay . Now ! Tell me , tell me ! F 11 . Tell me when you see a progress bar . It should be up right now . Talk to me , tell me when you see it . - I have it . - Press Ctrl + I. - Got it . 'Enter ' . I , ' Enter ' . Come over here and button me up . They are coming ! Doesn 't need to look pretty , just get it done . They are coming . Make sure that checkpoints are clear before you follow me out , OK ? We need more time . Okay . I 'm gonna go buy you some time . Stick to the plan ! Stick to the plan ! Yinsen ! - Yinsen ! - Watch out ! Stark . Come on . We gotta go . Move with me . C 'mon , we got a plan , we need to stick to it . This was always the plan , Stark . Come on , you 're going to go see your family again . My family is dead . I 'm going to see them now , Stark . It 's okay . It 's okay . I want this . I want this . Thank you for saving me . Don 't waste it . Don 't waste your life . My turn . Not bad . How was the fun-vee ? Next time you ride with me , okay ? Watch it coming up here . Are you kidding me with this ? Get rid of them . Your eyes are red . Few tears for your long lost boss ? Tears of joy . I hate job hunting . Yeah , vacation 's over . Where to , sir ? Take us to the hospital , please . - No . - No ? Tony ... - You have to go to the hospital . - I don 't have to do anything . I was in captivity for three months . There are two things I want to do . I want an American cheeseburger and the other one ... - That 's not going to happen . It 's not what you think . I want you to call for a press conference now . Call for a press conference ? What on earth for ? Yeah , Hogan , drive . Cheeseburger first . Look at this ! Tony ! I thought you 'll be in a hospital . Look at you ! Oh , burger , you had to have a burger . Did you get me one of those ? There was only one left , I needed it . Hey , look who 's here ! - Ms. Potts ? - Yes . May I speak with you for a moment ? I 'm not part of the press conference , but it 's about to begin right now . I am not a reporter . I 'm agent Phil Coulson , with the Strategic Homeland Intervention , Enforcement and Logistics Division . - That 's quite a mouthful . - I know . We 're working on it . We 've been approached already by the DOD , FBI , CIA ... We are a separate division . With a more specific focus . We need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape . - I 'll put something in a book , shell I ? - Thank you . Hey , would it be alright if everyone sat down ? Will you sit down ? That way you can see me , and I can ... A little less formal ... What 's up with the lovin ' ? Don 't look at me , I don 't know what he 's up to . - Good to see you . - Good to see you . I never got to say goodbye to dad . I never got to say goodbye to my father . There 's questions that I would 've asked him . I would 've asked him how he felt about what his company did if he was conflicted , if he ever had doubts . Or maybe he was every inch of a man we all remember from the newsreels . I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them . And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero-accountability . What happened over there ? I had my eyes opened . I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up . And that is why , effective immediately , I 'm shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International untill such a time , as I can decide what the future of this company will be , what direction it should take , the one I 'm comfortable with , and is consistent with the highest good of this country and the world . What we should take away from this is that Tony 's back ! And he 's healthier than ever . We are gonna have a little internal discussion and we 'll get back to you with a follow-up . - Where is he ? - He 's inside . That ... that went well . Did I just paint a target on the back of my head ? Your head ? What about my head ? What do you think the over-under on a stock drop is gonna be ? - Optimistically ? 40 Points ? - At minimum . Tony , we 're a weapons manufacturer . Obie , I just ... I don 't want the body count to be up ... That 's what we do . We 're iron mongers , we make weapons . My name is on facade of the building . What we do keeps the world from falling into chaos . Not based on what I saw . We 're not doing a good enough job . We can do better , we 're gonna do something else . Oh , like what ? You want us to make baby bottles ? I think we should take another look into Arc Reactor technology . Oh , come on . The Arc Reactor , that 's a publicity stunt ! Tony , c 'mon ! We built that thing to shut the hippies up ! - It works . - Yeah , as a science project . The Arc was never cost-effective . We knew that before we built it . Arc Reactor technology , that 's a dead end , right ? - Maybe . - Am I right ? We haven 't had a breakthrough in that , in what ... 30 years . That 's what they say . Could you have a lousier poker face ? Just tell me , who told you ? - Never mind who told me . - Show me . - Rhodey or Pepper . - I wanna see it . - Okay , Rhodey . It works . Listen to me , Tony . We are a team , do you understand ? There 's nothing we can 't do if we stick together , like your father and I. I 'm sorry I didn 't give you a heads up , okay ? But if I had ... Tony , no more of this 'ready - fire - aim ' business . - Do you understand me ? - That was dad 's line . You gotta let me handle this . We 're gonna have to play whole different kind of ball now . We 're gonna have to take a lot of heat . I want you to promise me that you 're gonna lay low . Stark Industries . I 've got one recommendation . Ready , ready ? Sell , sell , sell ! Abandon ship ! Does the ' Hindenburg' ring any bells ? Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan ! Look , that 's a weapons company that doesn 't make weapons ! Pepper ! How big are your hands ? - What ? - How big are your hands ? - I don 't understand why ... - Get down here . I need you . Hey ! Let 's see them . Show me your hands . Let 's see them . Oh , wow , they are small . Very petite , indeed . I just need your help for a sec . Oh my God , is that the thing that 's keeping you alive ? It was , it is now an antique . This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future . I was swapping it up for an upgraded unit and I just ran into a little ... speed bump . Speed bump ? What 's happening ? It 's nothing , it 's just a little snag . There 's an exposed wire under this device and is contacting a socket wall and is causing a little bit of a short circuit . What do you want me to do ? Put that on the table over there . That is irrelevant . I just want you to reach in ... and you 're just gonna gently lift the wire out . Is it safe ? Yeah , it should be fine . It 's just like an operation , you just don 't let it touch the socket wall . - What 's Operation ? - It 's just a game , never mind . - Just gently lift the wire . - Okay . - Okay ? Great . You know , I don 't think that I am qualified to do this . No , no , you 're fine . You 're the most capable , qualified and trustworthy person I 've ever met . You 're gonna do great . Is it too much of a problem to ask ? Cause I really need your help here . - Oh , there 's pus ! - It 's not pus . It 's a plasmic discharge , it 's from the device , not from my body . - It smells ! - Yeah , it does . The copper wire . The copper wire , you got it ? - I got it . Now don 't let it touch the sides , that 's what I was trying to tell you before . Okay , now make sure that when you pull it out , you don 't pull out the magnet and the end of it . That was it that you just pulled out . - Oh God . OK , what do I do ? - Don 't put it back in ! - What 's wrong ? Nothing , I 'm just going into cardiac arrest cause you yanked out ... - What ? I thought you said this was safe ! - We gotta hurry . Take this , you gotta switch , real quick . - Okay , okay . Tony , it 's gonna be okay . I 'm gonna make this okay . You gotta touch that to base plate . And make sure you ... Was that so hard ? That was fun , right ? I got it , I got it . Nice . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I feel great . Are you okay ? Don 't ever , ever ever ask me to do anything like that ever again . I don 't have anyone but you . Are we ready ? What do you want me to do with this ? That ? Destroy it . Incinerate it . You don 't wanna keep it ? Pepper , I 've been called many things . Nostalgic is not one of them . - Would that be all , Mr. Stark ? - That would be all , Ms. Potts . Hey butterfingers , come here . What 's all this stuff doing on top of my desk ? That 's my phone , that 's a picture of me and my dad ... Right there . In garbage . All that stuff . The future of air combat . Is it manned or unmanned ? I tell you , in my experience , no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot 's instinct , his insight - that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious and discern its outcome . Or pilot 's judgement . Colonel , it 's ... why not a pilot without a plane ? Look who fell outta the sky ! Mr. Tony Stark . Speaking about manned or unmanned , you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong . It 's spring break , just remember that . Spring break 1987 , that lovely lady , what was his name ? Was it Ivan ? Don 't do that , they 'll believe it . Don 't do that . Give us a couple of minutes , you guys . - I 'm surprised . - Why ? I swear I didn 't expect to see you walking around so soon . I 'm doing a little better than walking . - Really ? - Yeah . Rhodey , I 'm working on something big . I came to talk to you . I want you to be part of it . You 're about to make a whole lotta people around here real happy , cause that little stunt at the press conference , that was juicy . This is not for the military . I 'm not ... it 's different . What , are you humanitarian now or something ? I need you to listen to me . No , what you need is time to get your mind right . I 'm serious . It was nice seeing you , Tony . Thanks . - Jarvis , are you up ? - For you sir , always . I 'd like to open a new project file , index as : Mark 2 . Shell I store this on the Stark Industries ' central database ? I don 't know who to trust right now . Till further notice , why don 't we just keep everything on my private server . Working on a secret project , are we , sir ? I don 't want this winding up in the wrong hands . Maybe in mine it could actually do some good . Next . Up . Not the boot , Dummy , right here . You got me ? Stay put . Nice . And you , you 're no better at it at all . Lift ... I got it . Okay , I 'm sorry , am I in your way ? Up . That 's great , don 't even move . You ... are a tragedy . Okay , lets do this right . Start mark , half meter back of the center . Dummy , look for light . Stand back for fire safety . You , roll it . Activate hand controls . We are gonna start up nice and easy , raising 10 % thrust capacity to achieve lift . And 3 , 2 , 1 . Up two ? Alright , step back . I 've been buzzing you . Did you hear the intercom ? Yeah , everything 's ... what ? - Obadiah 's upstairs . - Great , I 'll be right up . I thought you said you were done making weapons ? It isn 't . This is a flight stabilizer . It 's completely harmless . I didn 't expect that . How 'd it go ? Oh , went that bad huh ? Just because I brought pizza back from New York doesn 't mean it went bad . - Sure doesn 't . Oh , boy . It would 've gone better if you were there . You told me to lay low and that 's what I 've been doing . I lay low and you take care of all the ... Hey , c 'mon . In public , the press ... This was a Board of Directors meeting . This was a Board of Directors meeting ? The Board is claiming a Post Traumatic Stress . They are filing an injunction . - A what ? They wanna lock you out . Why , cause the stocks dip 40 points ? We knew this was gonna happen . - 56 and a half . - It doesn 't matter . We own a controlling interest in the company . Tony , the Board has rights too . They are making the case that you and your new direction isn 't in a company 's best interest . I 'm being responsible . That 's a new direction . For me ... for the company . I mean , me on the company 's behalf being responsible for the way that ... - Oh , this is great ! - Oh c 'mon , wait ! Tony , Tony ! - I 'll be in the shop . - Hey , hey , Tony , listen . I 'm trying to turn this thing around , but you gotta give me something . Something to pitch them . Let me have the engineers analyze that , you know , draw some specs . - No . No . Absolutely not . This one stays with me . That 's it Obie . Forget it . Alright , well this stays with me then . Go on , here , you can have a piece . Take two . - Thank you . Do you mind if I come down there to see what you 're doing ? Good night , Obie . Day 11 , Test 37 , Configuration 2.0 . For lack of a better option , Dummy is still on fire safety . If you douse me again , and I 'm not on fire , I 'm donating you to a city college . Alright , nice and easy . Seriously , just gonna start off with 1 % thrust capacity . And 3 , 2 , 1 . Please don 't follow me around with it either cause I feel like I 'm going to catch on fire spontaneously . Just stand down . If something happens , then come in . Again , lets bring it up to 2.5 % . 3 , 2 , 1 ... Okay , this is where I don 't want to be . Not the car , not the car . It could be worse . We are fine . Okay , we are getting there . Yeah . I can fly . - Jarvis , are you there ? - At your service , sir . Engage head up display . Check . Import all preferences from home interface . Will do , sir . Alright , what do you say ? I have indeed been uploaded , sir . We 're online and ready . Start the virtual walkaround . Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment . - Do a check on control surfaces . - As you wish . Test complete . Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics . Ah , yes ... tell you what . Do a weather and ATC check . Start listening the ground control . Sir , there are still terabytes of calculations needed before an actual flight . - Jarvis ... Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk . Ready ? And 3 , 2 , 1 . It feels like a dream . Alright , lets see what this thing can do . What 's the SR-71 's record ? The altitude record for fixed-wing flight is 85.000 feet , sir . Records are made to be broken . C 'mon ! Sir , there is a potentially fatal build-up of ice occurring . Keep going ! Higher ! We 're iced up , Jarvis ! Deploy flaps . Jarvis ? C 'mon , we gotta break the ice !

 Where does it come from ? This quest ? This need to solve life 's mysteries when the simplest of questions can never be answered . Why are we here ? What is the soul ? Why do we dream ? Perhaps we 'd be better off not looking at all . Not delving , not yearning . But that 's not human nature , not the human heart . That is not why we are here . Yet still we struggle to make a difference , to change the world , to dream of hope . Never knowing for certain who we will meet along the way . Who among the world of strangers will hold our hand . Touch our hearts . And share the pain of trying . You don 't love him . Everything I 've done , I did for them . No ! You should 've taken the money . Why did you take that bullet ? You could 've let it phase right through you . - It 's okay . - Go . Forget about me . Save Micah . You can get us out of here . You can walk us through this wall . - I don 't know if I can . - You gotta do this . You can do this . Surveillance picked them up in the elevator . - What does he want ? - Molly . What am I thinking now , Parkman ? Your last thought . Lower your gun . Shoot me and she dies . As long as she 's alive , my daughter will never be safe . None of them will . You 'll take the life of one little girl to save another ? If I have to . Taking her life would save thousands . And Thompson ? Did you save thousands of lives by killing him ? No , just my own . - Officer Parkman ? - Molly ? You know this man ? I told you he was coming . He promised to keep me safe . That 's right . And nobody is gonna hurt you . Peter Petrelli . I challenge everyone here tonight to inspire by example . To fight the battle , no matter the cost . As the world is sick , spinning out of control . But we can heal it . Patty and the boys should be landing in Nantucket any minute . Chopper 's gonna meet us up on the roof in an hour . What is it , Ma ? It 's Linderman . He 's dead . - How ? - Someone got to him in his office . He was murdered . This is a terrible tragedy , Nathan . Yes , it is . But it doesn 't change anything . The plan wasn 't just his . You know that , Congressman . Yeah . After the explosion , the city is gonna need me , Ma . America 's gonna need me . The world . This changes nothing . 42 , Micah 's on this floor . You go . I 'm only gonna slow you down . I 'm not leaving you . You 'll die if I do . I can 't go with you , Nik . You have to do this alone . You have to find Micah . - I can 't . - You can . You were strong enough . You always have been . I 'm coming back for you . You stay right here , you understand me ? Linderman 's guards will be all over us if they find Thompson 's body . Maybe you should 've thought of that before you shot him . - It was self-defense . - And Molly Walker ? What 's your excuse for nearly shooting her ? She 's dangerous . You 're gonna need to start trusting me , Dr. Suresh . Yes , because that 's worked out really well for me before . Look ... the organization that I used to work for once stood for something . Now ... it 's been corrupted . Used to work for ? The only thing that 's important to me now is protecting my family . I will never let Molly be used to hurt anyone . She can do good in this world . I don 't think you understand the true nature of this organization . And you don 't understand how important she is to me . It was my antibodies that saved her . I 'm responsible for her life . Hey , there 's something wrong with Molly . - Hello ? - Dad . - Claire , where are you ? - Still in New York . I 'm with Peter , but there 's a problem . Ted Sprague 's dead . Sylar killed him . Dad ? Put Peter on the phone , please . He wants to talk to you . Hello . When you came into contact with Ted , you absorbed his power . That 's right . Well , now that Sylar 's absorbed it too , I think you may be the only one who can stop him . Now all we have to do is find him . Any idea where we start ? There 's a tracking system here . We 're trying to fix it now . As soon as we do , we 'll find him . And if you don 't ? You just stay close to Claire 's phone . Okay ? I 'll contact you the second we have a location . And whatever you do ... you keep Claire safe . - You understand ? - Yeah . What are we doing here ? I actually believed you . You lied to me . You said you weren 't gonna call him . I know , but think about it , Claire . - We can 't do this alone . - No , you think about it . - We can 't trust him . - Yes , we can trust him . Nathan has never let me down . Nathan doesn 't care about you . He doesn 't care about anyone . He doesn 't care about me , and I 'm his own daughter . - We do not need him ! - Yes , we do ! - Why ? - Because I 'm afraid , okay ? And I need my brother to help us . You lied to me , Peter . I trusted you . - What 's the emergency ? - The bomb . It 's not me , it 's Sylar . Sylar ? He killed Ted Sprague , which means he 's radioactive . And if he explodes ... Look ... I know that this is a lot to process , but it is real , I swear . And I don 't have a lot of time to find him . What do you want me to do ? I don 't know . Just ... help me . Come here . Look , if what you 're saying is real , then there 's no reason to involve Claire in this . - It 's just too dangerous . - No , she has to stay with me . She 's just a kid , Pete . If I find Sylar and I 'm able to stop him , then she 's the only one who can stop me if something goes wrong . You 're gonna be fine . - How do you know ? - You told me you - you could regenerate , that you could survive . There 's nothing you can do to stop it , Peter . They 're all gonna die . What is it ? Claire was right about you . What are you talking about ? Claire ? Claire ? Peter ! Claire ! No , no , no ! No , no , no , no ! This isn 't happening . How much longer before she 's up and running ? She 's not a machine . I just gave her the transfusion . It 'll take some time . Well , take too much time , and the city will pay for it . Sylar 's out there . - You mean the boogeyman ? - Don 't try to get up . I can do it . I can tell you where he is . Okay . So ... How do we do this ? I just ... I think about him in my mind , then I point to him on the map there . I need a push pin . So you can find anyone in the world ? You just need to think about them ? Almost anyone . Almost ? There 's only one that I can 't . Who 's that ? Is it someone bad , Molly , like the boogeyman ? No . He 's a lot worse . And why don 't you want to find him ? 'Cause when I think about him ... he can see me . Molly ... Can you think about Sylar now ? He 's there . That 's the Lower East Side . Somewhere around Reed Street . Isaac 's loft . Isaac Mendez ? The painter ? - Who ? - I 've gotta call Peter . Why don 't you let me answer that for you . Hello . Claire ? No , this is her grandmother . Where is she ? Where she belongs , with her family . Dad ! I 'm her family . No , you 're the man we gave her to to look after , to keep safe . A job you haven 't done particularly well . What are you gonna do with her ? Take her someplace far enough to keep her out of harm 's way . I suggest you do the same . There isn 't much time . Let me say goodbye to her . Dad . Claire . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . I 'm just trying to get away from these people . No , no . You 're better off going with them . - What ? ! - She 's right . You shouldn 't be here . But as soon as you 're safe out of the city , you try and get away . Do you understand ? Yeah . I need to find Peter . Where is he ? I don 't know . They won 't tell me . That 's long enough , dear . Tell me you have a plan , Dad . I have a plan . - I love you , Claire . - I love you too . We have a new priority . Peter Petrelli . We have to find him . What for ? We know where Sylar is . We can go after him . No , not without Petrelli . He 's the only one who can stop him . I 've come 3,000 miles . I left my pregnant wife at home . He 's a bad guy . I 'm a cop . I 'm going after him . Then he will kill you . Yeah , we 'll see . - There you are , sir . - Thank you . - Hi . - Hi . I 'm Peter . I 'm your father 's new nurse . Yes , I 've heard . I 'm Simone Deveaux . Nice to meet you . Your mother seems to know my father somehow . Yeah , she 's , uh ... Yeah , she 's , uh - Sorry . Yeah , my mother , she 's - She 's full of surprises . I want to thank you . I know it 's a real hard job . Dying is hard . What I do , it 's just ... I 'm here to help . No , you 're a real hero to care for a perfect stranger like this . This may sound strange , but ... Your father 's last few weeks , his death ... It could be beautiful if you let it be . Sure , a piece of cake . I 'm not saying it 's not tragic for you . I 'm just saying ... You know , death is the one thing that connects us all . Reminds us that 's what really important is who we 've touched , and ... You know , how much we 've given . Makes us realize that ... we have to be good to one another . See , your father ... he 's the real hero . Not me . Come on , I 'll show you the apartment . Get you settled in . Believe me , if he knew , you 'd know . There 's a look you just can 't hide when it first shows . What about Nathan ? Linderman tells me Nathan will be ready to play his part . Well , he 's been wrong before . Meaning what exactly ? I think that Linderman is betting on the wrong brother . We talking about the same Peter here ? I look in Peter 's eyes , I see compassion , empathy . But most of all , I see hope . This world won 't be saved on strength . What it really needs is heart , and that 's Peter . Charles , don 't get me wrong . I love Peter , but that poor kid can barely get out of his own way . He 's ruled by insecurities . He 's weak . No , trust me . This bomb is going to go off . And Nathan is going to be the one the world turns to . I don 't believe this tragedy 's inevitable . Well , then ... One of us is going to be right . And one of us won 't . Well , I 'm glad I won 't be alive to see which one that is . You are in my prayers , Charles . I could use them . Good-bye , my dear , dear friend . I know you 're there , Peter . Hmm , looks like you dropped something . A comic book that predicts the future . What will they think of next ? You 're kidding . This is how Isaac thought I 'd die ? Stabbed by a silly little man ! Hiro is not silly . You should 've seen the look on his face when he tried to kill me . - You cannot take my brain . - Please . What would I want with your brain ? - Where is Peter Petrelli ? - I don 't know . Where is he ? Let him go . I don 't think I 'm going to . Hiro ! All you have to do is stop time before I cut off his head . Do you think you can do your little trick before I can do mine ? Micah ! Micah . How ? - You can 't be here . - Look what you did . Oh , my God ! Micah . It 's all your fault , Niki . D.L. , now Micah . They 're both gone ... because you were weak . - Micah , please . - The wrong sister died . It should 've been you . Face it , Niki . You 're nothing . I 'm the one they needed . Molly , we need to go now . - Where are we going ? - Officer Parkman called . He believes that Sylar - He believe the boogeyman is on his way . No . He 's not on his way . He 's already here . I have to get some paperwork . I 'm not gonna be coming back to my office . Helicopter 's picking us up from the roof in ten minutes . When the jet lands tomorrow morning , you 'll be safe . But everyone else will be dead . How can you do nothing to stop this ? It 's inevitable , dear . There 's nothing anyone can do about it . That 's insane ! Nothing is inevitable . The future is not written in stone . I 'm afraid this one is . If everything is so inevitable , then why has she been trying to keep us apart all these years ? There are things you simply aren 't mature enough to understand yet . Yeah , like how you can let your own son die like this . Your own brother . He 's not gonna die . Thanks to you , Peter has the ability to survive . So he lives ... and kills millions of people . How can you let him be responsible for something like that ? And how can you live with yourself if he is ? Claire , I know that it 's hard for you to trust me right now . But this is all gonna make sense very soon . I promise . We 're offering you everything you 've ever wanted , Claire . A place to belong . A family . I already have a family . No ! I know what you 're thinking , Nathan . Let her go . You understand . How many times have I saved your ass ? I 'm the only reason that you 're still alive . Nikki , that 's not me . Stop her . Find Micah . - What ? - I said stop her . That 's not me . I 'm not strong enough . Who the hell are you talking to ? - Mom ? - Micah ? ! Mom , I 'm in here ! It 's locked ! Mom . Is it really you ? It 's me , baby . It 's just me . Wait ! He could be a bad guy . He needs my help . Okay , we need to get him out of here . It 's not working . They 've must have shut it down . Okay , I need a lookout . Can you do that ? Stand over here and keep an eye out . If anyone comes , tell me straight away . Invisibility . Always thought that that would be a good one to have . I don 't understand . How is this happening ? You 're alive . Is this a dream ? Am I time traveling ? Are you doing this ? Doesn 't really matter what it is , does it ? Only that you 're here now . Yeah , but I saw you speaking to my mother . You know about the bomb . You know about everything . You came here because you needed to . You needed to hear the truth before you could save the world . I save the world ? You 've had the power all along , Peter . You just needed to learn how to use it . Why me ? Because there has to be one that 's good . There always has . And your heart has the ability to love unconditionally . Like I told you . In the end , all that really matters ... is love . I 'm tired now . Let 's get you your rest then , sir . Call me Charles . Peter ! Peter ! Wake up , wake up ! I must 've blacked out . - How did you find me ? - I told you . We have a tracking system . And where 's Claire ? She 's safe . She 's with your mother . - My mother ? - Yeah . They 're on their way out of the city right now . Okay , you need to leave too . I don 't think I can control this . No , I 'm staying with you . You saved my daughter 's life . I told you I owed you for that . Consider this payback . Yeah , but if I can 't stop Sylar , if I lose it , I could - I 'll put you down myself . Don 't worry . I 'm a pretty good shot . Thank you , Mr. Bennet . Call me Noah . Come on . The guards are coming . Dad ! Micah ? We have to go . - It won 't work . - Yes , it will . Come on D.L. Come on ! It doesn 't look like there 's many places to hide . You sure about this tracking system ? He 's here . Don 't worry . Look , all right , then that means he 's hiding in plain sight . What took you so long ? Haven 't I killed you before ? Didn 't take . You think I 'm gonna let you ruin it all ? Take all the glory ? Did you really think you could stop me ? Mom , Dad needs your help ! Go back to your family . I 've got this . Wait , no ! No ! Turns out you 're the villain , Peter . I 'm the hero . - Sylar . - You . Ya-ta . - Hiro ! - Peter Petrelli ! - You can stop this . - How ? I need you to kill me . Do it . Do it . You 're the only one Claire . Tell me there 's another way , please . Shoot me . There is no other way . Yes , there is , Claire . The future isn 't written in stone . I took his power , Nathan . I can 't control it . I can 't do anything . I 'm not leaving you , Peter . There 's another way to end this , and you know it . I can 't let you die . And I can 't let everyone else . You saved the cheerleader ... so we could save the world . - I love you , Nathan . - I love you too . You ready ? What happened to them ? Wait ! Please don 't die , Officer Parkman . You 're my hero . We dream of hope . We dream of change . Of fire , of love , of death . And then it happens . The dream becomes real . And the answer to this quest , this need to solve life 's mysteries finally shows itself . Like the glowing light of a new dawn . Let 's go home . Home where ? Our house burned down . Home is anywhere our family is together . You 've got a plan , right ? So much struggle for meaning , for purpose . And in the end , we find it only in each other . Our shared experience of the fantastic . And the mundane . The simple human need to find a kindred . To connect . And to know in our hearts ... that we are not alone .

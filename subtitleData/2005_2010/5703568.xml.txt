 Thank you . I now raise a subject I believe is far more sensitive . As president of the Liberal African Party I wish to inform you that we plan on submitting another bill that would allow for the integration of immigrants in Africa . Silence , or I 'll stop the session ! Ladies and gentlemen , please ! Mister Kodossou' why do you insist on playing savior ? Why persist so hard in trying to pass bills that would allow white integration ? Because my party feels that Europeans who have worked here for over five years should be allowed African nationality if they request it . Moreover , they should have access to jobs other than menial ones . Silence ! Mr Kodossou' I have only one thing to say , Africa for Africans ! AFRICA PARADISE When unification failed , Europe became an underdeveloped comment . Savage fighting frequently broke out between peoples . Belgians , Swedes , French , Spaniards and Dutch . Epidemics , famine and political coups became common . The Turks took over Germany , Russia is governed by a cartel of gangsters , the Vatican is ruled by a protestant dictator , England has become a colony of Guatemala and France . France has fallen into total deoliine . On the other hand , the African Continent , which succeeded in uniting , has become extremely developed . As such , many whites now dream of obtaining visas to come and live in this black paradise . Paris , France one month earlier Consulate of the United States of Africa Stay calm ! Wait your turn . That 's all for today . That 's all for today ! A document is missing . What ? But I double-checked . Your electricity bill receipt ... But I have no money , I can 't pa " ; my bill . I 'm sorry . Africa cannot grant entry to immigrants with debts . Go cry somewhere else . New Hello . You 're married ? No , but we live together . You want the same destination ? Yes . You 're a computer engineer ' ? And the young lady is a schoolteacher ? That 's right . The problem is . those job quotas have been filled . On the other hand , we have job openings for ... masons , garbage collectors , road Workers . . And domestic employees . But we have educations . Garbage collectors and maids make a good living . Yes , perhaps . But : it 's impossible . Do you think your quotas might open up ? In Africa we have highly specialized schools for engineering and teacher training . Do you need us or not ? " Need " is not quite the word I 'd use . Come back m a year , you never know We 'll be fine , I 'll find a solution . We 'll be fine , I 'll find a solution . Your company went bankrupt , we almost starved in the countryside and theywoﬂt let us immigrate . W find a summon . And today 's headlines : the economic situation in France improves , 65 % unemployment compared to 66 % last month . Abroad , the Swiss Fundamentalist Kingdom has once again invaded the Democratic Republic of Monaco . And on the screen . . Is anybody here ? No need to shout , haven 't had gas in a week . Then Why open ' ? For the candy and sweets . The cake is on sale ! Give me your money ! Leave me alone . You wanna may huh ? Wanna play ? Come here ! Come on ! Come here , come on ! Stop it ! I don 't want to see your face anymore . - Go on ! - Son of a bitch ! Son of a bitch ! Are you OK ? Don 't touch me ! Don 't xvorry , it 's nothing . You 'll be fine . Would you stop pouting ' ? Be quiet . I was afraid ! OK ' ? You don 't think I was afraid ? What do you want ? I 'm sorry . What else can I say ? Your dad taught you karate , he says you 're a champ ! And you just stand thew You know very wvell I never fought for real . Oh , no ! Not again . I 'm sick of this country ! - Stop complaining . - And there 's nothing to eat . You have me and X have you . You still love me ' ? Silly girl . Silly DOV - So : Olivier , is it serious ? Just a faulty circuit , Mr. Valin . Good , because you can 't find those anymore Should I come backtomorrow ? Sorry , Olivier . I can only afford to pay you from time to time . The company has hit rock bottom . Do you have the address of that smuggling network ' ? DEPARTURE FOR THE FUTURE This network will get us into Africa . You just pay cash . You 're crazy ! There 's no work for us with a visa , xvhafll we do without one ' ? This is absurd . Pauline , weh find a Way once were there . We 'll never get work permits from here . It 's dangerous . What if they keep the money and kill us ' ? This is a surefire network . There 's a plane tomorrow . - I 'm taking it . - Tomorrow ? W borrow the money from my parents and our problems are over . You 're completely nuts . Come on , get a move om Come on , get a move om You got the money ' ? Hang om That 's for two . Let me check . Get on . You 're in Africa now . I 'll bring you to the boat and my job 's done . Thxs Way . What ﬂew are you m ? Pm a doctor . And you ' ? A corporate lawyer . You 'll have work , there are sick people everywhere . Slim Police ! Go on , jump ! Border control . What 's going on ' ? Is this a detention center ? A transit " residence " . - Yeah , right ... - Shut up ! I don 't believe this is happening . The hardest is over . We 're in Africa , we 'll find a xvay to stay . Do " you confirm the information in this file ? Do " you confirm the information in this file ? You first tried to some here officially ... That 's exact . We 're at your disposal for any job that corresponds to our training . Thank you for the offer . You 're welcome . But the rules are explicit . Since your entry into African territory was illicit and we have no need for your skills , we cannot allow you to stay . You 'll be sent back to your point of departure within a week . Now that we 're here , all we ' want to do is work . X understand , but the Law is the Law . She 's a teacher ! I 'm an engineer ! There must be something for us somewhere ! I 'm sorry , there 's nothing for you . I 'm an engineer ! You need my knowledge ! I 'm sorry . - Let us have a try ! - Calm down , honey . You don 't have the right ! Let go ! I said let me go ! Thank you . Whites should not be integrated for one basic fundamental reason : they 're different from us . 'My deem mend , in Africa today , each State has its own leader but a presidency rules the Continent . And so what ' ? Think back ... - Things were not always this way . - And ? How did we succeed our unification ? I ask the question , how ? By accepting our differences . I 'm sorry , but that 's not a convincing argument . Tne gap between Africans and Europeans is wider than between Africans . You can call the Patriotic Party radical and myself sectarian , but I repeat what I 've always said , a white will never be worth a black ! Mr Yokossx watch ' your speech . Mrs. President , I 'm not finished . And I shall go even further , two three four or five whxtes WM never match up to a Mack . Mr Yokossi , you forget one thing . We need foreigners . We need foreigners ? Certainly not , Mr. Kodossou . Be serious , Africa cannot feed the world 's destitute . Our country is capable of integrating those xvno work here . Give African nationality to whites ' ? Why not invite them to join our governments too ! And why not ' ? Surely you joke . How do you think we could possibly govern together with Italians , Belgians , Spaniards , Portuguese , French and God knows what else ! One group more irresponsible than the next . No more than certain of our own rulers . Mr Kodossou' X advxse you to watch your step . You are on a path that could bring you down . Very far down . You don 't scare me . No ? Ivly bill will soon be submitted and everyone will freely voice his opinion , bearing in mind , above and beyond our political rifts , our country 's interest . Integration ! Integration ! We shall see , Mr. Kodossou ! Whites out ! Whites out ! We 've been here three days doing nothing ! - Not me . - And what have you been doing ? Searching for a Way to escape . - Luckily he 's found nothing . - Ancl if he did ? Without papers you cam We or Work . I keep telling him . Papers can be bought , amen or made . - Are " you serious ? - Dead serious . Why is there no police surveillance here ? Why are we free to hang around ? Because it 's impossible to open the outside doors . They 're locked electronically . And ? There 's a computer in the office . I only have to crack the code . If no one wvatches the office : it 's because the code is secured . That 's what they surely think . But they don 't know I 'm smarter than their computer . Yeah ! Yeah ! H works Wake up ! - What 's going on ' ? - I did it ! Tomorrow morning at eight , the door wvill open . We walk out and it closes . No one will be the wiser . Maud Pm not going . There 's no risk ! We can only be deported . - What if they shoot at us ? - Be serious . Pm not cut out for adventure Are you coming ? We already told you , no . Listen , you leave , if you fail , they 'll deport you and we 'll meet in France . If you succeed , you can send for me . Officially , with a visa . You really don 't want to some ? Do " you love me ' ? Silly DOV - Silly girl . Don 't talk to me or touch me . I can 't say goodbye. it 's too hard . Open up You persist in claiming he had no outside help ? X do . Is it feasible that he cracked the code alone ? It 's absolutely impossible , the code is encrypted . Don 't mess with me ! He has extremely advanced knoxvledge m computing . You and your need to treat illegal aliens humanely ! You let them wander around and this is what we get ! I 'm not a policeman . In this center. we strive to treat illegal immigrants well . That 's it ... Treat them well . Who are you ' ? - Are you French ? - Que dices ? - Spanish ? - Yes , who are you ? It 's a long story . Can you help me ' ? I have no papers . Get lost , right away ! But Pm European too . Get out ! I have papers , I don 't want trouble . I only want you to hide me . You come around stepping on my toes and you want hem ? It 's Uncle Fvlodibo ! - Hello , Uncle Modibo . - Hello , Dovi . - What did you do today ? - Our homework . Good kids . I 'm proud of you ! So : did you find a maid ? Ivly dear sister , I spent my day at the Chamber of Deputies . Dear brother. we 've had no maid for a month . I 'm the maid ! I can 't take it anymore , you hear ? We told you choose a European . Never ! Whites are lazy ! All they do is play . Africans won 't take small jobs . Can 't you get that into ' your head ' ? If you looked , you 'd find someone . This is inadmissible ! Inadmissible ! You can 't find a vxhite with no money or papers ? We 've looked everywhere . Shut up ! Take 30 more men and get off your butts ! You 're not on vacation ! Get out and search ! Search ! Even the residential district ? Everywhere ! And if anyone asks any questions , you know nothing . Is that clear ? Otherwise we 'll look like clowns ! Get a move on ! Excuse me , Sir , do you know where Olivier Morel is ' ? The Frenchman who ran away . Sorry , I have no idea . Excuse me , Ma 'am , do you know where Olivier Morel is ' ? The Frenchman who escaped this morning . No idea . I 'm English . but I speak some French . This is my place . The cops won 't dare search here . - I work for a minister . - Thank you very much . We burned Joan of Arc we have to make up somehow . Sorry . I can 't laugh . - Illegal immigrant ? - Bingo . What 's going on here ? We 're searching for an alien , Mr. Minister . On my property ? Without a warrant ? - Excuse us . S " . - Ge away . Go away ! They 're leaving . Maybe we shoulcfve insisted . Never make waves vaith a minister , or your boss or your wife Conclusion ' ? We 've found nothing . Welcome . Thank you . You can stay here for a few days until the search dies down . And then I think ' you 'd be better off in the White City . The White City ? Immigrants xvho work for private parties , as a maidservant . gardener or xvhatever , live with their employers . But those who work in factories or elsewhere , live in a development . You should be safe there . What 's your profession ? I 'm the minister 's chauffeur . And in England ? And you don 't mind ? I had a choice , unemployment in London or driving a car in Africa . Yes ? Please sit down . Hello . You 're scheduled to leave for France tomorrow . What ? Do you know what happened to Olivier ? It 's been two days . X asked around , but it 's in the hands of the police . I couldn 't get an answer . Would you know if he were hurt ' ? Not necessarily . Can 't I stay here ? I 'd like to help . but it 's impossible . I can 't leave vaithout knowing . I can 't . Phase ' do something . X beg of you . Sign this . What is it ' ? A general job request form . Nhmmum contract one year Be careful , if he 's caught - or has already been caught - he will be deported . But once you sign a work contract you must stay here . - Good evening . - Mod \ bo \ What interesting affairs did " you handle today ' ? Finance committee : meeting with the minister , last minute changes to the bill . The usual ? That 's right . But outside of your political intrigues when will you settle down and start a family ? Mother' X work 12 hours a day . There 's time , I 'm in no hurry . The lion that waits too long to drink might never find nvater . The hon shank ! wok for a maid . Modibo Kodossou is becoming far too dangerous . Modibo Kodossou is becoming far too dangerous . Thank you . Do you realize ' ? Integrating immigrants ... Giving them political responsibilities . It 's stupid and it goes against our country 's interests . X agree Hello , Gentlemen . They 'd bring about our decline in no time like they did in Europe . I spoke to our group . Everyone 's worried . Right now , he doesn 't have a majority for his stupid bill but you never know . We have to act . At your orders , Mr. Yokossi . X want you to keep an eye on Kodossou for me l-le must have a weak spot . Find it and we 'll strike . This guy must be eliminated . What W he has no weak spot ? We 'll find one for him .

We need a household employee , but I also want someone who can help with the children 's education . X accept . Your salary is 5,000 .. X agree You know the situation ? X understand . And you two ! Sit still and behave ! She 's only the maid , not the President . I ' wonder how she 'll manage to give us lessons and do the dishes . I 'm sure she 'll do the minimum . - Is this your home ' ? - Yes . It 's beautiful . Pauline , this is my father . Welcome . Miss . Thank you . - My mother . - Pleased to meet you .

You treat her like that again , you 'll answer to me . Here 's the silverware . The dishes are here . And the food is in this cupboard . What do you usually eat ? Oh we 're not hard to phase . Mxss , do ' whites eat black babies ? Dovi : stop talking nonsense ! Who told you that ? Friends at school . And do blacks eat white babies ? Oh no , they 'd never do that . You see , Africans and Europeans are the same they don 't eat babies . Blacks and whites are not the same . Your racial comments do not interest us . Keep them to yourself . Then I 'M start over it 's true : we eat black babies . I like them grilled with ketchup . But if I 'm out of blacks X eat a white one . But they 're not the same . Minata , darling ! You agreed to take her . Mother : I still agree . But it 's hard having a white around . Between us , I don 't think you really know Europeans . I don 't need to . Everyone knows they 're good for nothing ! They 're thieves , lazy and hypocritical . Stop it ! Did you hear what she said about eating blacks ? No respect I thought it was pretty funny . Babies with ketchup ! Come m . Hello . This is Olivier . ( lemence . Hello . Paul . Charlotte . Swan . The word " welcome " would be unsuitable ... Stop it ! I 'll get going - Here 's the situation , we share the place . There are four of us we each have a room . I 'll sleep xvith Charlotte 'while you stay . You can have my room . I don 't want to put you out . I can sleep on the couch . No way . If anyone drops by , things have to look normal . You 'll be comfortable here . Do all whites live in communities ? Not necessarily . But rents m town are high . What are your plans ? Do fake papers exist ? Not easy to find , but they exist . What you won 't find , even with papers , is work as an engineer . It must be possible : no ' ? Are you deaf or What ? We rang for you two times . I didn 't know it was for me . Well , now you do . The salt ! Bring it in . Is there any way I can phone ? To your girlfriend in Paris ' ? They musfve deported her . Too dangerous . they have your voxceprxnt . You dial her number , the cops will be here . You can Wnte to her .

The police station is to the right . Good m . Something wrong ' ? Hey Pm taking to yaw I 'm staying . You changed your mind ? I thought about it all night . You 've decided for sure ' ? When m doubt charge ahead I know what 's ' waiting for me in France . Sorry , but I have to go now . - Can you find your way home ? - Yes - See you tonight then ? - Yeah . Thanks .

To see What he 's doing . That 's the point : he 's not doing anything . L-le 's going home. that 's all . Then write in the report : " Not doing any / thing . " Those are orders . Hello . X have news for you . I came home especially , I wanted to tell you in person . Olivier Morel has not been arrested . Logically , this means he 's alive and free . Mr. Koclossou , what is the status on the new bill that would allow whites to request African nationality after five years ? The bill is coming along . According to a recent poll , 46 % of our deputies are favorable . This means we only need another 6 % of voices and the bill passes . I think it is safe to say that this could happen soon Don 't you think that granting foreigners civil rights could create social friction ? I don 't think so . Being open is always positive . I 'm sure the day that all those who contribute to the prosperity of our country - regardless of origin - have the same rights and duties ... Africa will take another gmnt step forward . Gmnt step forward . Thank you , Mr Deputy . This guy is getting out of hand . You still have nothing compromising ? No , we 've tried but ... OK , I get it . We can 't let him continue winning voices . - We 'll switch to plan B. - Vvhich is ? First of all , stop trailing him . Very well . And then ? He has two children at home who he adores . We 'll kidnap the little girl . - Kidnap the girl ? - That 's what I said . Is there a problem ? No . But what will we ask for ' ? If he wants to see her alive ... He must keep the affair quiet . He 'll make a declaration : he 's still favorable to white integration - it has to be credible - but after giving it thought , he has decided it 's premature . Thus the bill will be submitted at a later date . Mr Yokossi , excellent idea . This will give us time to eliminate him somehow . And believe me , his Liberal African Party worft go far Mthout mm . Where do I get off for the White City ' ? It 's the next stop . - Thanks . - No problem . - Excuse me , do you speak French ? - A little . I 'm looking for a European who escaped from a transit center . Pm sure you heard about hm he must be here I don 't know . Hello . I 'm looking for a friend who ran away from a transit center . Why isn 't Pauline with us ' ? She needed a night off . Why ? She doesn 't know anyone . It 's none of your business , she 's free . I bet she 'd like it here . Eat your soup and hush . It 's not soup , it 's my entrée . I don 't want to be rude but ... Pauline 's food is far better . X agree Wxth that . I don 't believe it ! The horrible French girl has good qualities ? Qualities ! Don 't put words in my mouth . She 's a good cook. that 's all . It 's too bad she 's not black . No one is perfect . I 'm looking for a Frenchman who was in a detention center . - L-le 's tall and blond . - I have no idea . I 'm sorry . Are you crazy ? Hey can you hear me ? Can you hear me ? Is anyone there ? Is anyone there ? What do you think , could it ' work ' ? Look at it , it won 't explode ! - Where did you find it ? - On a dead man . You didn 't kill him ? Jean-Luc Dussan That 's good and French . Height ? It works . Age . . L-le lives in a community like us . Visa ... Working permit ... What was his profession ? Worker . Unemployed . Anyone know him ? No . The photo doesn 't look like me . X know where you can get one . They even have official stamps . Let 's go . - Right now ? - Yes You need to get your papers m order . OK , but he was a laborer and I 'm no handyman . You think I was a cocktail waitress before I came here ? We 'll visit his friends too . They mustn 't report him missing . - Will they agree ' ? - We all support each other . - Do I have to live there ? - Why ' ? - Yd rather stay with you . - We " Work n out . That 's sweet of you Jean-Luc . You have me and X have you . We 're in Africa , we 'll find a xvay to stay . I 'd rather be alive in a poor country than dead in a rich ohe . You have to take risks sometimes . You still love me ' ? - Silly girl . - Silly boy . Quite frankly , I find it abnormal , I 'd even say anachronistic , that in our day , a volcanic eruption can cause so many victims . Do you realize ? An entire region completely devastated ! Thank you . No other . Questions ? Very weh . No comments ? Mr Kodossou perhaps ? Excuse me ' ? Excuse me What ? What about the eruption ? I 'm against it . What are you doing ? Tidying up the garden , it needed it . - Can I help ? - You 're more than welcome to . You take the dead leaves and out them off . The leaves. not your fingers ! . Om - OK boss . Go ahead . Look , like this ? You 've got a green thumb ! You know , Pauline , I like you . I like " you too , honey . Mommy says whites are unbearable . But I think you 're very bearable . And " you 're a darling little girl . There 's no work for you , Mister . I 'm telling " you , there 's no work . - Did you find a Job ? - SUM nothing . We 've put the word out , you 'll find something . Olivier , you 'll find something ! - Hello . - How are you ? Fine : thanks . We eat local food , imports are too expensive . - Do you like guava ? - Don 't know what it is . He says he likes it . Later on , I 'll tell you about our union . What union ? The Union for White Integration . We 're fighting for whites to have equal job opportunities . Give me some yams . Politics and yams aren 't my thing . I take care of myself , that 's enough . Politics concern everyone . Either you take an interest or it 'll run your life . Yeah , right . You coulcfve gone with Grandma and Grandpa . You too X have an important date thus afternoon Me too . That 's news What do you have that 's so important ? X have to watch my soap opera . I 'll pretend I didn 't hear . Mommy ? Why don 't X ever see Daddy ? Generally speaking , divorced fathers rarely see their kids . That 's the way it is . And on top of it , he 's always traveling . Then he could travel over here . X made a drawing , I can 't even give it to him . I think that ... Let go of her ! Come with me ! This is unbelievable . I insisted on coming in person , Mr. Deputy . Thank you . You didn 't see his face ' ? No he wore a mask . Dad he speak ? Barely . What do you think , Mr. MDoula ' ? At first glance , I 'd say someone tried to kidnap " your niece for ransom . Boss ! I found some evidence in the garden . I 'll bring it to the lab myself . But . Something bothers me . R have your record here . You entered our country illegally , then your companion fled ... Won 't see any Ne . Neither do I. Sir . I merely observe that vaithin a short period she and Olivier Morel were involved in troubling events . Do " you know where he is ' ? You don 't know ' ? Pm sorry to break . I thought that ... He was Med m an aocxdent . Hit and run , he died instantly . We 'll kick some white ass today . Look at them Here 's one . Assholes . Let 's see your \ D Sir . Your ID . Excuse me ' ? Are you deaf ' ? Show us your ID ! - Get lost ! - Excuse me ' ? He xs deaf Get lost or \ , ve 'll help you ! What happened ? X dad my best he had too many bodyguards . Bodyguards ' ? That 's hot what the French girl says . Maybe he doesn 't want people to know he has guards . Wait for new orders . I don 't understand either . Tomorrow we 'll send the children to your brother 's place . No one WM find them there . JomvxHe-le-Pont ' Pont Punt When we 're all drunk , drunk , drunk That 's when we go To the open-air ball ... It 's about time ! - Sorry . I 'm late . - Don 't worry . X have some news . Better be good . I found " you a job . As a carpenter . The boss is a friend , I 'll take " you there . Carpenter ? I can 't hammer a nail ! He 'll show you , don 't worry . He knows your story . What if an African who works there knew Dussart ' ? There are 2 ' 30 guys on the site . And blacks think we all look alike . Yes X understand . No problem ... I 'll give him the message . Goodbye , Sir . - ' JVho was that ? - The Chief of Police . Tne lab exams came to nothing , tne fingerprints are unusable . Which means they have no idea who wanted to kidnap Dovi . He says he 'll do everything in his power . Yeah , sure How are ' you ? Pauline , you 've been in bed for two days . That 's not reasonable . You should never give up . Never . We have to combat death with life . Look , this is all you have to do . That 's good . OK you 're Wed . Thank you , Sir . - Cheers . - To work and friendship . Do you think about her often ? Reg u larlLy . We must act . In three weeks , Kodossou submits his bill . More and more deputies are in favor . What a world It 's not safe to attempt another kidnapping , especially not with your thugs . I assure you , Pvlr . Yokossi , they 're very efficient . We 'll talk about it another time . Mr IvTDouXa , the ideal would be if the whites did something that would discredit them amongst the population . Why would they do us that favor ? Mr IvTDouXa , one creates such situations . Not bad huh ? X really wanted to show you thus spot . It 's crazy ... It feels like we 're no longer on Earth . You don 't want to swim ? - Aren 't there sharks ? - Plenty . Don 't worry , if one comes near , I 'll talk politics and it 'll fall asleep . I don 't think I 'll try . I 'm glad to see " you 're getting better . You had us all worried . I had myself worried . On the 28th the bill will be submitted . This concerns us " IOOO % . We can 't sit around doing nothing . What do you propose ? The Liberal African Party is fighting for us . We have to act X repeat ' what do you propose ? We 'll organize a peaceful demonstration . We could start out at the White City and wind up at Ivlillennium Square . I don 't see the point . Not at all . Let her finish , please . When we reach Millennium Square we 'll make a declaration to the press saying we 're ready to assume our social responsibilities . I 'm sure it 'll have a positive impact on the people and the deputies . Yeah sure , they don 't care what we think . Ask not , receive not . This is true . Does anyone have another suggestion ? No one ? Then let 's vote . Who is against tne demonstration ? Who is for it ? This wood is magnificent . This wood is magnificent . But we 'll take a look over there too . Ah , Mr. President ! You see , dear that 's a good sign . She 's my good luck charm . The best good luck charm possible . I 'm fed up with Pauline ! She doesn 't even know you 're alive ! Yes she does We wntten her . I 'm the one without a clue . Exactly . She could be screwing someone at this very moment . I forbid you to say things like that ! You hear me ' ? Now leave me alone . Get out ! Good night ! Don 't talk to me like that ! This is my home ! Damn lucky too , otherwise I 'd have thrown you out ages ago ! I 'd like to get some sleep ! I 'll leave you alone . Don 't forget to pray to St. Pauline . What do you want from me ? Very little , I 'm not crazy . Only to share your bed . But apparently , that 's too much to ask of you . And now what ? Let me gm It 's going to be a long night . Let go of me you bastard . And ' we 're proud to present the Chief of Police , Mr. M 'Doula . Everyone is asking the same question , so I will ask you : do you think the European demonstration on Tuesday will be peaceful and uneventful ? I sincerely believe so . I 'm sure the organizers are aware of the fact that if demonstrators generate any violence whatsoever it will discredit them in the eyes of our society . Above all , we need responsible citizens who are capable of calm interaction . So it won 't be called off ' ? Absolutely not , we recognize whites . Their requests might be debatable but I 'm sure they will act with dignity . - Thank you , Sir . - Thank you . Do " you think this will be enough ? It should be . - There are only five of us . - Take a look . Did you talk to the children ? For precisely thirty seconds . They were too busy to talk . Pass me the salt . In fact , how are things coming along with Moclibo ' ? They 're coming along . Good . I 'm glad you were able to forget the other one . Hello . What do you want ' ? I called about the apartment tor rent . It 's for my wife and I , we live in community housing but ... It 's been rented . When I called 2O minutes ago , it was free . I just rented it . We have money , we both Work . I understand , but it 's rented . What can I do ' ? Good day , Sir . Here 's a walkie-talkie , money and a weapon . Perfect . Tuesday : before the demonstration , you 'll go to the Cascade ' worksite . Find a hiding spot and ... Mus dear ? Or do X need to repeat it ? It 's clear . This is my round . You 're the best .

I shoulcfve gone anyhow ! It mighfve helped . You shoulcfve stopped Pauline . She insisted on going , it was supposed to be safe . Don 't worry before we have news . There have been no buses or taxis for hours . She probably can 't get home . We can 't sit around doing nothing . Father , I haven 't stopped phoning . Mr. Yokossi , ' what is your opinion on these tragic events ? What can one say in a situation like this ? It is regrettable , tragically regrettable , but unfortunately. foreseeable . I 'm sorry , but Europeans are not yet responsible enough to hold positions of power . Pauline ! Are you OK ? I 'm fine . But I need to be alone . - Do you need hem ? - No excuse me - It 's me . - Come in . I saw Olivier . He 's alive . How can that be ? I don 't know . He 'll oall me tomorrow .

Mr Kodossou \ Please ! Not all at once ! Do you confirm the rumors that your bill will not be submitted as planned ? That is the conclusion my party members and myself came to this morning . After yesterday 's sad events , it seems preferable to hold off for a while . - How long ' ? - This is only a setback . We are convinced that the majority of Europeans are ready to take on responsibilities together with the majority of Africans . - One last question ? - That 's all . Where are you going ? I have authorization to see Olivier Morel . Go on You 're coming with me ' ? You managed it ' ? Are you comang WM me ? - No . - You 'll come later ? I can 't face the misery anymore .

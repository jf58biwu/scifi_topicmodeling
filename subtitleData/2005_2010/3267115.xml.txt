Listen to me.He was here , the guy who did this to her . He took off when you guys showed up . Let 's get you out of here , kiddo . You have to let him go . He 's not the bad man . It 's okay . Simply put , mrs.Vasser , it 's bad behavior . What kind of bad behavior ? Well , he disobeyed and talked back to his teacher . And last week , we had to sit zack out of recess twice for fighting other children ... it 's become a concern . I 'm sorry.We 'll address it . You need to understand that if it becomes necessary , zack will be suspended . Okay . Are there problems in the home ? No , just that zack 's had some trouble sleeping . I mean , between you and your husband . Oh , no.We 're getting along all right . Um , my husband 's been traveling a lot . And I went back to work . Wasn 't Mr. Vasser supposed to be here today ? He got called away . Last minute . Well , odd behavior , unexplained absences ... those sound like his symptoms ? Something like that . - Could be schizotypal personality disorder . - Schizo ? - I 'm not saying he 's schizophrenic . - Oh , that 's a relief . But what about his behavior ? Is he hearing voices ? Is he paranoid ? - No . - What about delusions ? Yeah , you could call them that . So he disappears for hours at a time , no explanation . Sometimes he puts himself or his family in danger . Most of the time . Well , you could always do a 51-50 . Whoa , whoa ... take him in ? Yeah , well ... it 's not like you have to send a bunch of guys after him with butterfly nets . Just set an appointment for him with a shrink . Give him the chance to go in voluntarily . So you 're saying he 's a nut job ? I 'm saying he could be sick . Then he can stay that way.I 'm done . One of these has got to work . So how is it that they mistook you for this guy ? You know , katie , I 'd rather not talk about this one right now.Okay. Okay . How was the meeting ? Oh , you know , our kid 's about to be suspended , and , uh , mrs.Murray is convinced we 're unfit parents . I don 't know why . You 're having a lot of fun over there . Have I seen you guys here before ? - No . - No . So I got her to let me be room mom , see if we can 't straighten zack out . I 'm sorry , I should 've been there . Hey , it is what it is . Jack could get you out of these . That 's the last person I want to see me like this . Yeah , I know , but , you know , you are going to have to talk to him at some point . Katie ... next topic . Hey ... uh , should we , uh ... - keep these ? - Yes , if they 'll keep you home . Hey . On us . Not my style . You want dan vasser , talk to dan vasser . You want to know about the stories he 's working on , read the paper ... somebody should . Actually , I 've conducted an impromptu audit of your pages in the last six weeks . Not a lot of dan vasser bylines to speak of . Well , he delivers when it counts . Well , from what I 've gathered , he 's been busy chasing the famous dylan mccleen . We 're pretty sure he tested airport security for the story . There 's no story . He may have come into the stolen cash . - There 's no story . - How do you know that ? Because he told me there wasn 'T . Look . We 're both interested in the same thing here . Oh , that 's a good one . You practice that in the mirror ? We want the truth . Mr. Vasser is investigating a federal crime , an unsolved crime . If we could sharesome of his sources , it would be good for both of us . You get a scoop , I get a criminal . Oh , you want sources . Why didn 't you say so ? I realize it 's an unorthodox request . Unorthodox and impossible . Dan vasser did a couple of weeks behind bars because he wouldn 't name a source for a grand jury . You expect him to give it up for you ? I was hoping for a little cooperation.That 's all . You 're the feds . You want his browser history , phone records , even his grocery list , take it without asking . Isn 't that what you boys do these days ? - You practice that in the mirror ? - Just made it up . I overslept , sorry . Hey , it 's 8 : 10 . Why don 't you have your shoes on ? I don 't need them . Yeah , you do.Put ' em on , buddy . He hasn 't eaten anything . He doesn 't like my pancakes . Since when don 't you like mom 's pancakes ? I want you to make me eggs . Okay , zack . * * * * About your behavior at home and at school ? You know the thingyou got upstairs . The thing with the weird handles . You swing it around and the little italian painters kill all those mushrooms ? - It 's called a wii . - Right , so guess what ? Wii 's not gonna see you for the whole " wii-kend . " - What ? - Yes , so socks , shoes , then three bites ... go . What time did he go down ? Doesn 't matter , he was up again at 3 : 00 . Couldn 't get back to sleep for another hour . - That 's the second time this week . - Third . Has he talked to you at all about ... - your vanishing act ? - No , you ? No . - I got to go . - Why so early . This guy kept a little girl behind a brick wall for three months . Whatever happened to her ? She 's a foster kid . Social services placed her with a new family , but she ran away . I tried to find her to write a follow-up , you know , after the other girl disappeared . What other girl ? Another foster girl . Went missing about a year later . - Turned up dead . - What ? Oh , the whole thing was a huge black eye for the city . Which gave me a lot of bylines . And which brings me to you ... is this going to be an actual story , or another one of your snipe hunts ? Who 's this ? Aeden bennett ? Oh , yeah . He was trying to move some abandoned buildings down in soma . He managed the place where they found her . He was never a suspect ? - Yeah , but the cops cleared him . - Why ? I don 't remember.He 's no killer , though , just trying to make a buck.He actually turned out to be a pretty good source . I 'll bet . You 're not saying this is the guy . I 'd have to know that for sure , wouldn 't I ? It 's not like I was there or anything . Jack vasser , please . Rudy 's working pio . If you want a statement , talk to him . - I 'm not here for a story . - I can 't help you then . - I need you to question somebody . - I need a weekend in cabo.You see that happening ? - Come on . - Dan , forget it . You want me to apologize ? Is that it ? No , I know you wouldn 't do that , because you 're never wrong . What I want you to do is see a shrink and get some meds . I think I 'd rather have that trip to cabo . You need help , danny . - You 're afraid . - Afraid of what ? That I might be right . That I might actually be telling you the truth . You calling me crazy is your way of staying in denial . You 're a piece of work , you know that ? I knew this was a bad idea . I thought maybe for a second you could put our crap aside and just be a cop.I was wrong . - Dan . - What ? What ? Did you get chased by the cops in 1995 for passing a counterfeit $ 20 bill ? Yes.Yes , it was a $ 20 from 2003 . The cabbie sicced a cop on me.I barely outran him . How did you know about that ? I didn 't say it was a cabbie . yeah , if I remember ... the whole emily kelso thing took place a couple of blocks that way , but that place is long gone . Yeah , you can 't stop progress . Not if there 's profit in it . So just take me back to ' 92 . Police report says there was a rave party that night . - Did you know about it ? - Wish I had . Those people were in and out of my buildings all the time . You try showing a space after they 've trashed it . - I hear you . - So , why 's this coming up now ? We review these cold cases every now and again . It 's routine . All right , well , listen , anything you need , just give me the word . You got it , and if I do turn anything up , you 'll be the first to know . - Okay . - Okay . There you go . Piping hot . You 're a prince.Thank you . Hey , lady , you forgot your paper . Jewish State Founded In Palestine . Your really old paper . Best in the city . Really delicious.I think I used to buy from his grandfather . Are you going to eat that or just talk about it ? - I got it for you . - Oh , great . Okay , so who are we looking for ? Emily ... she 's probably around 15 now . Foster kid , like you were , at least that 's what you told me when we were together . That wasn 't a lie . Except back then , they called me a slant . That was swell . I don 't see her . There 's no tourists around here . When you 're a runaway , you look for the easy mark . - Let 's try over here . - Why not ? Listen , I know stumbling through the past gets old real quick , but you did save this girl . Yeah , from a kidnapper who 's still a free man and got away with murder . So how 's that for irony ? That 's part of the job description . - you know I saw you . - What ? Past you , in ' 92 , at a rave party . - Yeah ? - Yeah . I vaguely remember that phase . - Right before we met , right ? - Right . You were something . best thing about ' 92 , beat the hell out of ' 48 . I guess stumbling through history hasn 't been all that bad , right ? I stumbled on you , didn 't I ? No , I want to finish this ! I want my full commission ! Ten bucks per head . I get half ! Hey , let her go ! I 'm sorry , prince valiant . You want to mind your own business ? No , I want to mind yours . Take a walk . See the sights . - thanks . - Sure . Emily ? - You 're ... - yeah . I understand . Got it.Thank you . - Hey , pace yourself . - It 's hard . How 'd you find me ? I 'd rather know how you stayed hidden . Social services lost track of you . You trying to disappear ? I don 't like anybody they put me with . So how are you ? I know it 's been a few years since it happened . - I put all that behind me . - Good . Is that why you never identified the kidnapper to the police ? I couldn 't remember what he looked like . Didn 't really want to . Emily ... is there a bathroom I could use ? - I 'd like to clean up a little bit . - Sure . Towels are under the sink . so what happened to her real family ? The caseworker said her mother terminated parental rights when she was three . - And the father ? - San quentin . - 15 years left . - My god . It 's amazing she survived . It 's part of the skill set . So how are we gonna play this ? Well , my past self 's at work . Your past self is what ? Interning at the D.A. ' S office . That 's perfect ... you can take her to social services , get her placed in a good home . What are you gonna do ? What she never could ... find the man who did this . And what ? Put a bullet in his head ? Connect him to the crime.Alert the cops.I don 't know . Dan , didn 't you learn anything from the earthquake ? This is different . You showed up at the park because you 're supposed to help emily , not be running with a vendetta . Bennett 's gonna kidnap another girl , if he hasn 't already . - Then let it happen . - Are you kidding me ? ! It 's history , dan , let it stay that way . You 're supposed to be following your ... instincts , right ? So what happens if I don 't ? It never ends well . What does that mean ? ! Liv , i 'm gonna do this . Whatever happens , I can handle it . So nice to meet you . Hey , this , uh , this lipstick is kinda neat . It 's like ... rich . It 's vintage . I like y 'all 's place . It 's not really our place . Isn 't this all your stuff up in here ? It 's complicated . Wow , whole new you . Yeah , figured I should tame the look . Well , you look good . Except ... I think that lipstick might have been a bad idea . yeah , you 're probably right . The more adorable the better . I 'm gonna find you a really good family . Hey , long as they feed me , I can deal . It 's like tupac says , " keep your head up , " right ? Yeah . I 'm not , um , gonna have to testify or anything , right ? About the kidnapping ? Well , you need to talk to someone , emily . It 's the only way you 're going to get past all of this . I could ... if people would let me . Hi , there . Yeah , just checking in . Okay , all right . That 's fine . See ya . Uh , I got his number , right.That 's good . You call up mark ? anthony , that 's now how we treat other living things . Give me back . zack ! He started it ! Zack ! Dude , it 's a whole new operating system . So far , it 's way more simple , yeah . Everyone went out for tacos.I 'm just , uh , I 'm just hanging . I can 't get enough of this online stuff . They 've got this thing , it 's called , um , it 's called a " chat room . " It 's like those old 976 party lines , except it 's not three bucks a minute or whatever . yeah , you meet people . All kinds . Whoa . Hey , look , I gotta go . Yeah , okay , I will . Bye . Excuse me . Can I help you with something ? - I was just ... - you mind putting that down ? You don 't remember me , do you ? Uh , yeah , afraid not . About three years ago , a little rave party about four or five blocks from here ? These listings , which one 's got the next little girl ? Or haven 't you found her yet ? That 's why you 're cruising the net , right ? No ! No ... well , yeah , of course it hurts . You hit himpretty hard . And listen , young man , just because nicholas takes everyone else 's toys , doesn 't make you the sheriff of the playground , okay ? I still don 't feel good.My head hurts . Well , I 'll get you some medicine . You hungry ? You want grilled cheese ? Can I still play the ... - the wil ? - No . - For how long ? - We 'll let your dad decide . Zack ? zack ? Zack ! Zack ? Zack , where are you ? Zack ! Oh , dan , god ! How did you ... ? I just ... - got here . - Well , zack 's missing . - What ? - He disappeared . He-he said that his head was hurting , and then he ... vanished . Zack ? Zack ? Zack ? Zack ? Zack , you in here ? Zack ! come on . Oh , my god . - What are you doing ? - I 'm sorry . It 's okay . I thought if i could disappear , then you would have to come save me . You would have to come find me . I found you , okay ? I found you . Emily kelso . Yeah , I remember her . My parents volunteered for the search for her when I was a kid . - But she turned up eventually , right ? - Yeah , mystery man at the scene . He pulled her frombehind a brick wall . And dan thinks that this bennett guy went on to kidnap another girl ? Kidnap and murder . Micaela martinez.Also a foster kid . She turned up dead in 2001 . That 's horrible . Dan says the bennett guy was cruising internet chat rooms as far back as ' 95 . Back when that stuff just started . They keep internet records back that far ? I don 't know . Well , I mean , how does dan know ? I mean , have you ... seen his research ? If you want to say something , theresa , say it . Yesterday , you thought he was suffering from delusions , and now it seems you 're buying into them . No , I 'm not buying into anything.I 'm just helping him out . Well , he certainly needs it , right ? I mean , it 's a big story . What , you think he 's making all this up just to get a scoop ? Come on , you don 't know my brother . If you find anything in there , I 'm buying lunch for the rest of the week . Well , leave a nice tip . What ? - hello ? - You don 't answer your phones.Where the hell you guys been ? - I 've been trying to reach you for 20 minutes . - Hey , quality time with zack . - Why , what 's going on ? - Put dan on . - Uh , he can 'T.He 's just ... - katie , put dan on now . Hon ? It 's jack . He 's , uh ... he 's acting like jack . Thanks . - What ? - Okay , micaela martinez ? Here 's the thing.Her last foster parents , they were software designers . They had a lot of computers in their place and they said ... - she spent a lot of time in chat rooms . - Yes . - Can you do something or not ? - Well , I can dig . No matter how much I dig , I don 't think I can get chat room logs that far back . - So you can 't connect her to bennett ? - I 'll do what I can . - Either way , I 'm putting his ass under surveillance . - Okay.Good. Everything cool ? Katie didn 't sound like herself . Oh , zack got suspended today . - Suspended ? - Yeah . It 's a long story . - I gotta roll . - All right , go . Jack , thanks.Does this mean you 're ... coming around on my ... - condition ? - I 'm not gonna worry about that now .

Your brother faxed that . Emily kelso ... she was arrested a couple of years after I left her for dealing ecstasy . I 'm sure you 'll change her life . Katie , I 'm sorry.I know it 's been a hell of a day . Yeah . Listen , we need to figure out what 's happening to you , dan . We need to figure it out so we can fix it .

It 's getting worse . thought I 'd run into you . Ha.That 's funny . - Is this 2001 ? - Yeah . Then we don 't have a lot of time . Hey . Hey , you guys , want some ? What are you selling ?

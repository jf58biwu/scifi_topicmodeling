 He 's due at midnight . He 's usually punctual . You really need all these ? - I 'm not sure how strong he is ? - He 's stronger than you ? - Yes . - Strength isn 't usually a variable . - I 'm sorry ? - In cases like this , you don 't get extra muscles or anything . There aren 't any cases like this . Please . The woman sitting opposite you is Katherine Reimer . She 's a psychiatric nurse , with experience in ... related areas . She is fully apprised of the situation , and yes , she can be trusted . If you approve , she 's coming to work for us , for both of us . She won 't take sides . Please consider it . We can 't go on the way we 've been going . In the event she decides to release you from the chair , the cameras are on . You know the rules . You don 't keep him in that chair all the time ? - Of course not . - So what 's it for ? He has violent episodes and he doesn 't like surprises . Am I the surprise ? - I want you to feel safe . - Great job you 're doing . If released , there are three things he never leaves without . What 's the chair for normally , when you 're not making girls feel safe ? Sometimes I punish him . OK . Three things ? Digital recorder , runs for 24 hours , kept on at all times unless by prior agreement . GPS , keeps a track of his movements . Afterwards , download everything onto the computer . There 's timecode on both for correlation . You wear those things too ? - Yes . - Mutual surveillance . - Exactly . - And the third thing ? The dictaphone . It 's how we communicate . " We 're running low on milk , " that kind of thing ? Sometimes . What 's wrong ? He 's coming . You said violent episodes . - Yes . - What if he has one ? There 's not a lot you can do . Under the circumstances . Please , could you just sit over there ? What if he hurts someone ? If he 's as bad as you say ... - He is . - What if he kills someone ? - He won 't . - Why not ? Because I 'd turn myself in . Are there rules for you too ? He says if I ever attempt to look for a cure , he 'll put a bullet in his brain . I see . He doesn 't know the code . You 'll need to memorise it . - I just did . - Anything else I should tell you ? Do you ever smile ? Let me know . Good luck , Miss Reimer . Good night , Dr Jackman . 6pm . I 'll be offline for three hours . I will not be changing location . Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Hi . Hello . All right ? - What have you been up to ? - Pick us up ! Lifting you two is like lifting two huge , enormous , fat men . What are you eating ? Right , you two . Out to the garden . I have to talk to Mummy . See you in a minute . You might at least have had the decency to be having an affair . It 's one thing coming second best to another woman . But coming second best to no woman at all ... - You 're being positively thoughtless . - How long has this been going on ? That was so going to be my question . You put a private detective on me ! I can 't believe you left your wife and kids without a word of explanation . I win ! So , this explains the black van that 's following me everywhere . We never discussed the colour of the van . - Daddy ! - In a minute . I don 't ... I don 't have a secret lover or anything . - Secret lover ! - Well , I don 't ! Darling , you 're too repressed to have a secret lover . Was I always repressed ? Even at the beginning ? When I had the twins , do you know what my first thought was ? What ? I think he likes me . Hmm . Stop it ! Eddie ... Eddie , I thought I told you to ... Eddie ! Eddie , I mean it ! Night-night , Eddie . Night , Harry . - I should go . - Oh ? Is that what you should do ? - Tom ... - Claire , I can 't ... Whatever the problem is ... whatever it is that 's keeping you from us , whatever 's happened that 's so bad you think you can 't even talk to me about it ... Fancy a fuck ? Claire ... Sorry ! - What 's wrong ? - Got to go . Tom ... Not here ! Come on ! No ! No ! - Dr Jackman ? - Unscheduled change . He 's coming . What brought it on this time ? It 's happening more ... No time ! - You look ... different . - How much do I owe you ? Just once . Seriously , just bloody once , could you tell me where you parked ? Good evening . - I don 't drink whisky . - It 's not for you . - I wasn 't sure who to expect . - He didn 't stay long , couple of hours . - Between 8 and 10 . - I 'll tell him he owes you . - Unless you want the time now . - No . Thursday evening . I 've got a meeting out of town . - Fine . Where did you come round ? - The usual . - Did you pay her ? - Yes . Prostitutes take their money up front . You paid her twice . No reason to pay double when you 've only got the one , you know ... Thank you , Katherine . If you changed in the car , you hid it in the glove box . Want me to go and look ? Isn 't he entitled to know he 's married ? I should give you the safe combination . No need . - Sometimes you 're quite frightening . - Which coming from you ... What triggered it this time ? It 's happening more and more . - Do you think it 's stress-related ? - I don 't know . - We should start making notes . - If you like . - Any messages ? - No . Anything from him ? - He wants a name . - Where did that come from ? Not having a name , I imagine . - Tell him to choose one . - He wasn 't asking permission . Tell him he has it . Your books arrived . Only two titles they couldn 't find . I 've tracked them down , they 'll be here tomorrow . Thank you . That 's a lot of reading . Must be a very long article you 're writing . It is , yes . Are you looking for a cure , Dr Jackman ? Which obviously I 'd completely understand , but I work for both you and that 's not in the terms of your agreement . You 're entitled to research your condition , but then he 's entitled to know he 's married , isn 't he ? He 's not married . I 'm married . Good night , Katherine . Good night , Dr Jackman . - Where do you want access to ? - Just the library . Not the coffee shop ? That would be nice . Thanks . We miss you round here , Dr Jackman . Writing another article ? Well , you know ... Keeping the wolf from the door ? Always . You don 't do crosswords . - How do you know ? - They 're for fun . Good Lord , really ? If you want to talk , you don 't have to lurk about in my vicinity . Just try phoning . Well , there 'd be all that ... You know ... - Chatting . - Yeah . Is it worth mentioning I still haven 't changed my mind ? Is it worth mentioning I still haven 't advertised your job ? You should . Oh , for God 's sake ! Six months . Your wife and your job ! If you 're having a breakdown about some waitress , you must 've got it out of your system by now ! Peter , advertise my job . How can you bear it ? Writing about what you used to do . How can that be enough ? I 'm fairly certain you used to have some sort of an ego . - I did . It got so big it left me . - Actually , that 's quite funny . Oh , you 've got no idea . Well , hang on , hang on . Couldn 't we at least go for a drink ? Sorry , I 've got someone coming . Advertise my job . What 's that expression about Satan skating to work ? Something to do with hell freezing over . - It 's a sort of a quip . - Not anymore . - OK , OK , a quick half , then . - I 've got to go home and change . - Yeah ? - Have you seen the time ? - I 'm heading back now . - He 's due at 7 . He 's never late for a scheduled change . - I know . - I found that detective agency for you . They 've got an office at 19 Bowman Road . - Bowman Road ? - Yeah . - That 's just ten minutes away . - You don 't have time . No . No , of course not . Come on , come on . - Excuse me ? I 'm looking for ... - Through there . - You OK ? - What do you think , sweetie ? No , no , they 're all cancelled . No , I 'm serious , love , all of them . Breaks my heart , too . Itsy bitsy pieces . Listen , I 've got to go . No , really , I 'm going . Kiss your dogs for me . Bye-bye . Obviously you know who I am . Good evening , Dr Jackman . The black van is a little hard to miss . Probably the tinted windows . - I 'm not coming through to take notes . - You never did . Well , that goes double now ! How ? Exactly ! Why didn 't you show my wife all of the photographs ? I know there must be others . There 's someone missing . A friend of mine . If you 've been following me , you 'll have seen him . There must be photographs . - Well ? - He 's a pretty boy . All the more reason to have shown the photographs to my wife . Dr Jackman . At this moment , do you know what the single most important fact of your life is ? - I thought I did . - Have you got five minutes ? - Yes . - Don 't go anywhere . - Hello ? - Apparently I smoke . - When did he start ? - Where are you ? - I can change in the car . - Are you in the car now ? Stick a patch on his arm . Remind him we don 't have a lung each ! - Dr Jackman , are you in the car now ? - I 'll call you back . - Where did she go ? - Home . - For the night ? - For good . We 're closing down . - I 'm sorry ? - You 're sorry ? ! - What ? - A rich relative upped and died . You know what 's funny about that ? I don 't have any rich relatives . Know what else is funny ? Neither did she . - You 're Dr Jackman , aren 't you ? - Yes . So , what 's so special about you ? - Special ? - Someone paid her that money , and you 're the only one she was following . - Got any rich relatives ? - What 's her mobile number ? - I can 't give it out . - She just sacked you . - You said you were coming back . - I told you to stay where you were . What the hell are you doing ? Getting away from you as far as I possibly can . So I see . Dr Jackman , the single most important fact in your life ... - Is what ? - I don 't own a black van . What the fuck ? What the fuck do you think you 're doing ? Are you listening to me ? - I 'm sorry ... - Get up ! Get up ! - I have to go . - Yeah ? - Maybe not , eh ? - Billy , leave him ! Shut up ! What I am reaching for is not a weapon . - What the fuck are you doing ? - You see , just a tape recorder . He 's got a knife . Minimum necessary force . You understand me ? I will check . - What are you doing ? - Saving your life , I hope . Turn around . Face the wall ! - Why ? - Because I told you to . - Was he attacking you ? - What 's it to you ? Just trying to salve my conscience . While I still have one . You stay there , don 't move . He 's got a knife . Minimum necessary force . You understand me ? I will check . What was that about ? You look ... Well , you don 't ... First fag of the day ... always hits the spot . You stay away from me . I 'll hurt you . Yeah ? You think ? Mmm ... Don 't worry . I have a good doctor . Jesus ! It 'll hurt more tomorrow , which works for me . Now ... you know what I call this , children ? I call this the perfect start to an evening . The night is young , there 's a beautiful girl , and somebody 's going to die . It 's you , by the way . - What ? - OK . " Minimum necessary force . " Let 's see . What do you say , I 'll give you three goes ? - Goes ? - With the knife . You can give it your best shot three times . Then afterwards , once you 're done , I 'll break your neck . - What ? - The neck 's quick for you , easy for me . - Everybody 's happy . - Billy , just go ! That 's an option . I 'd consider that . Because quite honestly ... I 'm only in this to fuck your girlfriend . - That was one . - Billy , just leave ! Ooh ... I think she wants to be alone with me . OK . One more go . - Make it a good one . - Billy , please ... Billy ? That 's a good name . I might use that name when you 're finished with it . Which is going to be any second now . OK . Let 's make it easy . Mmm ... Pick a spot . Relax . Take your time . You 've got the rest of your life . Oh , well . Thanks for competing , you 've been great . But it 's time to say good night to the folks at home . Are you ready Billy ? Here comes God ! Don 't kill him ! The truth is ... Are you listening Billy ? The truth is , if I 'm being honest , if I 'm not winding you up , I don 't get a lot of pleasure out of killing children . But I get enough . - OK . Do you know anything about lions ? - Lions ? What happens when the head lion gets killed by a young one ? Do you know what the lionesses do ? They go straight into heat for the new head of the family . Hubby 's dead , the cubs have been slaughtered , and suddenly everybody 's singing " Can You Feel The Love Tonight " - Do you want to play lions ? - Please , let me go . No ! Come on ! Let 's play lions ! Don 't run . Not when you 're playing lions . You know what runs ? Food runs . Let me go ! Mmm ... C-c-c-c-c-catch you later . Fact is Billy , I have a nice side . But you just missed him . Billy . What do you think ? Could I be a Billy ? Go on . You were here before , weren 't you ? Yes . Well , I 'm surprised you can remember it . My liver applied for a transplant . This time , let 's not give him the chance . - What do you want ? - What 's really bad for hangovers ? Hello . Your friend left . Oh , hang on , hang on . Oh , look at you , Mr Safe Sex . I 'm impressed ! Oh ... Shit ! - You 've numbered them . - Yeah . - Why ? - It 's an arrangement . - Who with ? - Doesn 't matter . I don 't even know your name . Funny you should say that . Mr Hyde ? Mr Hyde , are you in there ? - Is that you ? - No . Mr Hyde , I saw you go in there . - Who the fuck is Mr Hyde ? - You are . Says who ? I hope I didn 't catch you in the middle of someone . I got you a drink . I 'm Benjamin . Benjamin Lennox . Call me Ben . Call me whatever you like . Mr Hyde . You don 't know that 's your name ? Oh , come on . " Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde " . You read that . Do I look like a big reader ? Movies then , all those movies . You 're a movie star , you know that ? You 've been Spencer Tracy , Michael Caine , Jack Palance even . Who else ? John Barrymore . Barrymore ? Was that a silent ? - Yes , sir . - Who cares about silents ? You 're wondering what the hell I 'm talking about . I 'm wondering about that wee window up there and if you 'd fit through it at speed . This is Christopher . And in the event of , er ... you attempting any violence on my person , Mr Hyde , Christopher is going to take an attitude . Believe me when I tell you , you don 't want to be there when Christopher takes an attitude . You know what ? Don 't throw me out the window , Mr Hyde . What do you want ? To tell you who you are . - Who says I want to know ? - I do . Who are you ? Well , forgive me , Mr Hyde , and I mean this in a corporate rather than an individual sense , but in point of fact , I 'm your owner . Now , there 's two things we can do here . I can tell you what the hell I 'm talking about , or you can try and throw Christopher out that little window . I don 't think Christopher 'll fit . Cheers . Cheers . - Don 't be an idiot ! - What the hell 's going on ? ! What time of night do you call this ? Dr Jackman keeps apologising for his bad temper . Doesn 't realise he 's permanently on four hours sleep and a hangover . - You should give up on him . - I 'm sorry ? He 'd never have hired you if he 'd wanted you . Know why ? Never had a reason to think about it . If Jackman gets a hard-on , I 'm it . That 's interesting . Because I 've always thought of you as a bit like a hard-on . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . - Usually disappointing . - Mm . Drink all of it . Katherine ? Katherine ? Katherine ? - Who 's there ? - Katherine ? - Dr Jackman ? - Yes . Sorry , I just ... I thought ... Are you all right ? I 'm fine , I just ... Dr Jackman ? I woke up during one of his dreams . Do you want anything ? Can I do anything ? No , no . I should just go back to bed . Good night , Dr Jackman . Good night , Dr Jackman . If you wouldn 't mind , thanks . I 've still got that headache . Should I see a doctor ? - No . - Damn it ! Oh , great . Yes . Uh-huh . Thank you . That detective agency , Callendars , closed down . Forwarding address is just a mail box . " The Lion King and other Disney favourites " . That 's his , I should put it away . - He has Disney favourites ? - He likes the songs . My dark side likes Mary Poppins ? No wonder I was bullied at school . You said yourself , he 's a child . - Find out where that mail box is . - Bedfordshire . Exactly , physically , where . Hello , sweetie . This is the part where you 're supposed to follow ME . It would be ever so helpful if you were awake . I 'm the one without any rich relatives . Which is a bit of a lie , actually . I 've got an uncle with a half-exploded liver , but it 's tactless to make plans . Anyway , I 'm in that tangerine car over there . Pop your engine on , try to keep up . If you 're careful , I bet I shan 't suspect a thing . Found him ! Right . Although technically , he was supposed to find us . Sorry , Miranda . But he fell asleep while he was waiting . He wouldn 't make a very good detective . No , I don 't suppose you would , would you , Dr Jackman ? Either of you . At first I thought it was a kind of make-up job . But the hairline is clearly different . And also he 's at least two inches taller , and a little narrower across the shoulders . - You missed out " sexier " . - He 's a sexy boy , yep . And if we notice he 's sexy , he must be pushing the envelope . Isn 't that so , dear ? Oh , look . I think Dr Jackman 's making a clever old deduction about us . - So . Tell us about ... yourselves . - Why ? Because I was paid a very large amount of money to stop following you . Which we took , of course . I didn 't care to see what came next in their repertoire of persuasion . And also , we need a new kitchen . And there 's the baby , of course . Oh , and the baby , yeah , of course . We 're pregnant . Well , mostly me . So , any idea who might be bribing us , Dr Jackman ? - No . - Or following you in a black van ? - No . - Don 't you want to find out ? - Of course . - Then let us help . - I don 't need help . - You do . I can handle this on my own . Oh , I entirely believe you . But then again , you never are , are you ? On your own . It started about six months ago . I 'd had symptoms before , but nothing really major . Hair on my forearms out of nowhere , things like that . Then I started having blackouts . Except , of course , they weren 't blackouts . I thought it was a split personality thing , but there was an actual physical change . For a while I thought I was cursed , or a werewolf , or God knows what . And what do you think now ? I don 't know what to think . I know how often you go to the library . I even know what books you get out . Does your other half know you 're looking for a cure ? I 'd rather you didn 't tell him . I won 't . What have you found ? There 's nothing to find . My condition is unprecedented . Nothing like this has ever happened before . Yes , it has . You 've been looking in the wrong place . Ah . " Jekyll and Hyde " . The comparison has occurred to me , but this is fiction . Step into my office ! Dr Henry Jekyll , 1883 , Edinburgh . Amongst his close friends , one Robert Louis Stevenson . Jekyll died a few months before Stevenson 's story was published . - It was a true story ? - At least based on truth . - He looks like me . - Exactly like you , yeah . You said he died . At the age of 43 , not long after this photograph was taken . About my age , then . I think time is becoming a factor . What did he die of ? It 's unclear , even in the story , but he ... died as Hyde . But my case is different , isn 't it ? He drank a potion or something . He was drugged , that 's how he changed . I never took anything . Well , maybe you just inherited it . Like it 's in your blood now . Runs in the family . Well , that would make sense . Just one problem . They aren 't related . - But look at them . They must be . - But they can 't be . Why not ? It 's interesting that you have twins . Do they have similar personalities ? Or are they opposites ? They 're very sweet , Dr Jackman . Don 't you worry about them ? What , with your , you know , funny turns ? Dr Jackman has given a great deal of thought to their protection . Of course . Though one wonders how much protection would be enough . So why can 't Dr Jackman and Dr Jekyll be related ? Because Dr Jekyll is the last of the Jekyll line . There are no brothers and sisters , no surviving cousins . Nobody . - Well , that 's impossible . - You 're a foundling , aren 't you ? Left in a railway station in Belfast , raised by foster parents . Nobody really knows how you got here . I know you 've tried to find out , so have I. But there 's nothing out there . Not a footprint , not a kiss . You arrived in this world without a trace . Dr Jekyll , 1883 . Dr Jackman , today . I think we need to find out how you got here . - Where do my children live ? - I 'm sorry ? My family , my children . Where do they live ? - Tell me the address . - Well , you know the address . - I 'd like to visit them . - You visit them all the time . I 'd like to visit them now . Min , could you pop to the house and get the other file on Dr Jackman ? - The one with the address in it . - There isn 't another file . Yeah , yeah there is . It 's the top shelf of the sitting room . - No , I 'm sure there isn 't . - Min , please , just do as you 're told . Honestly , it 's like I 'm your secretary or something . Dr Jackman ... I think you assume that your other half is a manifestation of your dark side , I don 't think you 're right . I think he 's a child . Albeit a child with the body and drives of a fully grown adult . He has extraordinary strength and speed . He has stamina far beyond the norm . And he 's also brand new . How often in this world does the sun rise on something completely new ? And how often do we mistake a miracle for a monster ? I don 't think he 's a monster . Or at least , he doesn 't have to be . Do you understand me ? Do you understand me ? You can be anything you want to be Mr Hyde . Mr Hyde . Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Da ... You might have told me you were just going to ... Bloody hell ! What happened to you ? Have you done something ? Have you dyed your hair ? You look ... You look ... Oh , my God . I 'm sorry , I 'm so sorry . I thought you were Tom . You ... you look just like him . Well . I 'm guessing your second name is Jackman . I didn 't think Tom had any family . Neither did I. It 's so typical . Tom never even mentioned he had a cousin . - But you know what he 's like . - What 's he like ? Well , you know . Well , he keeps it all inside , doesn 't he ? At times it 's like talking to someone who 's lying at the bottom of a pond . Hmm ... Someone ought to drain that pond , see what 's lurking at the bottom . Shall we go through ? There 's cake . Bring a knife . What a perfect start to the evening . Oh , God ! - Hello ? - Well ? I spoke to Hyde , but didn 't get anywhere much . Hyde is an animal . You wouldn 't . What next ? I 've got a few thoughts , kicking them around . When can we bring him in ? How soon ? We can 't just pull him off the streets . This is England . It 's the third world with rights . Tom Jackman won 't have rights for long . It 's a nice thought , Ms Utterson , but I don 't see ... He can 't control Hyde . Not forever . Eventually , Hyde will do something . Something that Jackman cannot forgive . Eventually he will know that he cannot contain him . And then WE begin . - Daddy ! - Harry ! - Daddy ! - Eddie ! Hello , boys ! Hi . How are you ? I 'm the surprise , eh ? Me coming ? Nice to see you . Nice to see you . Oh , boys , boys . Tom ? I didn 't hear the car . Are you all right ? I , um ... Is Billy still here ? Billy ? - Your cousin Billy . - My cousin ? He said you knew he was coming round . Is he still here ? - No , no , he 's gone . - Oh . He had the kids up playing half the night . This whole house looks like a bomb hit it . - I 'll put some coffee on . - Come on . You can help . And you . Serious charmer , by the way . You ought to watch it . He 's ... Well , he 's like you . Only alive . Wish I could see your face , Daddy . Got you that time , didn 't I ? Be sensible . What makes you think I would ever harm my family ? Ooh , and here 's something interesting . I found out my name ! Someone told me my name . Isn 't that good , Daddy ? My name is Jackman . Your name 's Jackman too . But I think you 're not going to be around much longer . Time 's up , old man . It 's time to move over and let the next guy have a go . World 's changing , got to change with it . Love your wife , by the way . Do you know about lions , Daddy ? Do you know what lionesses do when there 's a new head of the family ? Good night ... Dr Jackman . Hello ? Dr Jackman ? Dr Jackman , is that you ? - Dr Jackman , please say that 's you . - It 's me . Are your family OK ? Listen , we couldn 't stop him , he locked us in the cellar . He said he wanted to see his family . Are they OK ? - They 're not his family . - Dr Jackman ? They 're not ... his ... family ! Dr Jackman , are you all right ? They 're not your family ! They 're not your family ! - They 're not your family ! - Tom ! Are you all right ? Yeah . I 'll be down in a minute . It 's all right . What 's wrong ? Nothing , I 'm all right . I 'll be down in a minute . Mum ! Mum ! Listen to me . We have had an agreement . A truce . And it has worked . We have survived . But understand me . There is a line I will not allow you to cross . If you ever come here again if you set foot near my family again no agreement , no truce , it 's war . Do you understand me ? Come to my family again , and you and I are at war ! As long as the lights and cameras are on , you 're safe . Lights out ... you 're dinner . Hyde . I can 't believe he 's calling himself Hyde now . For God 's sake , wipe your nose ! He 's capable of anything , if he can get away with it . I know what he 's like , Dr Jackman , I 've met him . - Alone at last . - Don 't play these games . Not with me ! All respect , we 're running out of time . I 'm not in love with Dr Jackman . You 've heard of good cop , bad cop ? This is the movie ! Ever killed anyone Benjamin ? - Not personally . - You 're missing out . Welcome to the company , Mary Poppins .

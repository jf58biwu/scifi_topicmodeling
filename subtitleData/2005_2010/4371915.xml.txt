 NARRATOR : Previously on Heroes . AII the answers could be behind this door . I know that guy . He 's running for congress . What 's my father involved with ? ( POLICE SIREN WAILING ) Is there a problem , Officer ? Mr. Linderman wants to see you . I 've been in love with you since the minute I first laid eyes on you . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Don 't hurt yourself . What are you doing ? This is going to happen , right ? No ! Oh ! claire ! SURESH : Sometimes questions are more powerful than answers . How is this happening ? What are they ? Why them and not others ? Why now ? What does it all mean ? Hello . Is this the hospital ? Am I hurt ? You are fine . I was at a bar having a beer . We had to drug you . I 'm sorry about that . What ? What 's going on ? please don 't get excited , Matt . We 're trying to test your resting rate . ( GRUNTS ) Just relax . What are you , the FBI ? Huh ? The CIA ? I 'm not part of any organization that has initials . Listen to me . Whoever you think I am , believe me , I 'm not him . I 'm not ... I 'm not anyone . Oh , that 's not true . You 're someone . Someone very special . Who are you people ? Are you trying to hear my thoughts , Matt ? Not with my friend here . He 's special , too . ( GRUNTS ) I am ... I 'm an LAPD ... I 'm a cop . Everything you see , by tomorrow it won 't matter . Who 's claire ? You 're further along than we thought . Go deep , then clean him out . What does that mean ? What ? ( MATT SCREAMS ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) You are going to die in five weeks then New York will explode . ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) I think it 's best if Micah waited outside . Mr. Linderman is willing to forget your debt in exchange for a favor . What kind of favor ? There 's a man arriving this afternoon from New York . A politician who wants some help from Mr. Linderman . We 're looking for a Iittle insurance on our investment . And you want me to ... I 'm not a whore . I think we 've established what you are .

Secondary injuries are postmortem . Base of the skull was punctured by a broken tree branch . Appears to be a victim of homicide possibly accidental . ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) ( COUGHING ) WOMAN : Hello . Hey ! ( PANTING ) Oh , my God . WOMAN : I Iove you , too . Bye . claire ! I 'm making waffles . Internal polling shows a three-point bump from last night 's speech . Now , I say we roll the dice and hold off before we get into bed with Linderman . I can handle Linderman . He may have owned my father , but he doesn 't own me . Look , man , I don 't know about this . I mean , it just makes me nervous . It 's your job to be nervous . It 's my job to get elected . In order to do that I need money . With Linderman 's $ 2 million , we can turn eight points into three and make it a horse race . Mr. Petrelli ! Excuse me , Mr. Petrelli . Mr. Petrelli , I must speak with you . Find out about this guy . Thanks for your vote . I 'm sorry , but Mr. Petrelli is a very busy man . Your life may be in danger . I believe someone is targeting you . Can you be a Iittle bit more specific ? Twelve percent of the electorate strongly opposes me . Does the name Sylar mean anything to you ? I 'm sorry , I didn 't get your name . It 's Suresh , Dr. Suresh . Get rid of him . Sir , I 'm gonna take down your information . Have you noticed any changes to your physiology ? Something outside the norm perhaps ? An ability you didn 't have before . Mind reading , spontaneous regeneration . please , it is very important that you listen to me . Keep an eye on this guy . I don 't want this nut job following me to Vegas . Not a problem . Have a safe trip . Fine . Get him out of here . I don 't want to see his face again . I know . They 're all around . They 're all around . They get into ... You 've got to listen . Last night , before we kissed , you made a toast . To love . May we stay away from it when it 's not good for us . I was meaning to ask ... I wasn 't talking about you , clearly . I know , it 's just ... You and Isaac . ( DOORBELL BUZZING ) ( DOORBELL BUZZING ) There 's coffee in the kitchen . You think this is one big joke , don 't you , Pete ? Your buddy , Suresh , he came by my campaign office this morning . Made a big scene . He was talking about mind reading and spontaneous regeneration . Chandra Suresh . Yeah . How did he find you ? You tell me . What , you think I called him ? Don 't insult me . I 've got trained professionals to do that . Hey , where 's your mugs ? Hey . Oh , it 's ... They 're in the cabinet with the water stain that looks like Abraham Lincoln . Okay . Look , here 's some money , all right . Take it . You want answers ? Go find them . It 's on me . I need you to disappear for a while , okay ? You 're becoming a liability . I 'm sorry . I 'm opening a new show at the gallery , and a Iot of crazy stuff to deal with . Is it Isaac 's paintings ? It 's Isaac 's paintings . It 's Isaac . It 's his whole " I can paint the future " thing . What if he can ? Paint the future , I mean . Stranger things , right ? No , that 's about as strange as it gets . Take it . You can bring it back tonight . Peter , I don 't know what this is . I mean us . I just got out of a two year relationship that was very destructive , and here I am sleeping with the guy who was taking care of my dying father , and it 's a Iittle confusing . Yeah . I don 't want to be the rebound guy . I just need time to catch my breath before you take it away again , okay ? Okay . claire ! Breakfast ! Would you please tell your daughter to drag her fanny out of bed . claire , drag your fanny out of bed . claire ! Dad , I 'm not deaf . Your mother 's making waffles . Were you out all night ? No . Were you with the quarterback ? Yeah . Yeah , it was just a bunch of us . It was stupid . I 'm sorry . SANDRA : Honey , you 're going to miss your plane . Be there in a second . I 'm very disappointed in you . Nothing happened . played poker . I 'm sorry . I Iove you , claire . I just want you to be honest with me . You can tell me anything . You know that . I know . I Iove you , too . Don 't think you 're getting away with this staying out all night thing . There 's going to be a throwdown when I get home . What ? Mom said to tell you the waffles are ready . I 'II be there in a sec . SANDRA : claire ! Waffles ! Like such an ass . I 've never been so humiliated in my Iife . What would you expect , him to invite you in for tea ? Oh , this came for you while you were gone . It 's my father 's ashes . You know , I haven 't shed a single tear since my father 's death . Not even when I claimed his body . They showed me three John Does before they finally found him . My father was misfiled . I 'm really , really sorry . And what have I been trying to prove ? I 've used these theories , the map , this Sylar , all of it . Just to validate a relationship that ended a Iong time ago . I have no business being here . You 're just gonna give up ? I 'm going home to Madras . To scatter my father 's ashes and go back to my Iife and stop trying to live his . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) PETER : I 'm looking for Chandra Suresh . He doesn 't live here anymore . Guys at the Petrelli campaign gave me this address . They said he came by this morning . You Chandra Suresh ? No , that was my father . Yeah . Your father wrote a book about people with abilities . I think I may be one of them . Sir , no more bets . Step back , please . WOMAN : Winner , black 26 . ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) Thank you . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) So . Hey . Still looking in the mirror , seeing a you that ain 't you ? Yup . Hell , I can relate . It 's called getting old . A little Botox will do us both some good . I 've been blacking out . Okay , I wake up , and things aren 't like they were . ( SIGHS ) Like the time you woke up with a couple of dead thugs in your garage ? If you think you had something to do with that ... One of them was torn in half . Okay , then obviously it wasn 't you . Well , what if it was ? I 'm having these violent dreams . I mean really violent , where I am tearing people apart . But it 's not me . It 's someone else in me . With me . Do you know what I think ? What ? I think you saw something . I think you saw something so horrible , that it broke a part of you . I mean , what happened in that garage ... ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Mom ? Want to play Scrabble ? Oh , I do . I really do , but I can 't right now . This is our game night . I know , and I 'm sorry . But why don 't you ask Tina ? She reads those romance novels . I bet she has an excellent vocabulary . You know what ? I do have an excellent vocabulary . And those novels are the only romance I 'm getting these days . I will take that game and I will challenge you , little man . You are on . Why can 't you just work at home like usual ? Because this job is different . You 've been different . I know I have . Come here . I 'm so sorry . It has not been fair to you , but you have been a trooper . But I have things under control now . And I 'm just going to do this one thing , and it 's going to solve a Iot of problems for us . Then you won 't be able to get rid of me . Fine . But it 's safer over the Internet . What ? I mean , what you do , I mean , in the garage , it 's just acting . None of it 's for real . MICAH : He sent a limo . Either he 's a crap house rat , as in " crazy as , " or he 's one of them . AII he 's really telling me is that he can 't do anything . Crap house rat . Don 't you want to at Ieast follow the smoke and see if there 's a fire ? It was a pleasure to meet you . Good luck with the whole flying thing . Thanks . So , when you 're with your brother you can fly , and when you 're with the artist ... Isaac . Yeah . I only met him once , but after I ... I drew the future . And now you can 't do either . Maybe I can only do things when I 've around other people who can do things . Did that sound as lame as I think it did ? It sounds like you should be talking to my father . This was his research , not mine . Where is he ? How do I get a hold of him ? He 's on the table . I ... I 'm sorry , but you believe that this is possible . You have to , you believed it this morning . What if I prove it to you ? Then prove it . We 'II go see Nathan . When I 'm around him I can fly . I 've done it before . Twice . Fine . Let 's go see your brother . Wait , he 's in Vegas . Of course he is . Then I 'II take you to Isaac 's . But it 's complicated . Complicated how ? Isaac . Paintings are by the door . I thought I was buying the new pieces . I need the new pieces . Because they tell you what 's going to happen in the future ? How much for the old paintings ? To tell you the truth , Isaac , I don 't know if I could sell those . So , you only like the ones I painted when I was high . Interesting . Won 't give me an advance ? That depends . What 're you going to do with the money ? I need painting supplies . I take it you 're not talking about oils and canvas . It was raining last night . What 'd you do , Simone ? In the rain ? You followed me ? I drew this seven weeks ago . I drew him there , and here , before I 'd ever met the guy . Are you in love with him ? Looks like you 're in love with him . I don 't know how I feel about him . And I don 't know how I feel about you . So here we are not knowing how we feel about each other , and this entire city is going to go ... ( MAKING EXPLOSION NOISE ) Unless I stop it . You think you can save us all by shooting up ? I can save everybody . I 'm going to be a hero . Look , you can 't say anything . I 'm fine . I was drunk . It was an accident . Which part was an accident , the rape or the murder ? It didn 't happen . Yeah , because he killed you before he had the chance . I 'm alive . Yeah , now , but you weren 't on the autopsy table . ( SHUSHING ) Look , you said you had a hole in your head . Maybe when they pulled out whatever was in there , that 's when you , Iike , rebooted or whatever . I 'm not a hard drive . No , you 're Little Miss Miracle-Gro . Don 't ever call me that again . You 've got to tell somebody about Brody . No , I don 't . And even if I wanted to , which I don 't , I don 't have a mark on me . But you know what happened , and he knows what happened . AII he knows is that he was drunk , and I 'm not dead . Hey , what happened to you last night ? I was hoping you 'd tell me . I had way too much to drink . I ... I gotta go to the bathroom . He must have a bladder the size of a pea , because he just went . ( POP MUSIC PLAYING ) Full house ! I win again ! ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) Thank you . AIDE : You 're meeting Miss Sakamoto tomorrow at 11 : 00 a.m. But no Linderman ? He 's quote otherwise occupied . Occupied . What is he , a port-a-potty ? Don 't let Sakamoto geisha you . Get him in the room . Okay , I will . Oh , my God . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . It 's my fault . Are you all right ? Yeah . Oh , so much for Celine Dion . Just the one ticket ? Yeah . I 'm here for a conference , and I really don 't like the people I work with , so ... So , you 're traveling alone , are you ? I 've only met him once , but maybe I ought to do the talking to start . He 's ... He 's kind of a heroin addict . A heroin addict ? You neglected to mention that . Hey , just suspend the skepticism at Ieast until you meet him . The default scientific position is skepticism . Your father managed to get around it . I don 't know . He took a pretty big leap . You 've got to respect that . I did more than respect it . I believed him . I had to . I was his son . Can 't be the only reason why you believed him . Look at what 's happening to our planet . Overpopulation , global warming , drought , famine , terrorism . Deep down , we all sense that something 's not right . My father always talked about how an entire species will go extinct while others , no more unique or complex , will change and adapt in extraordinary ways . He had a romantic take on evolution . And you don 't ? You 're both geneticists . Which is also evolution . We 're all just variations of the Iast model . Yeah . We 're just cheap knock-off 's of our fathers . ( SCREAMING ) Isaac . It 's Peter Petrelli . I 'm a friend of Simone 's . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) PETER : Isaac . Isaac . Oh , hey , Lori . Hey . I saw you go off with Brody Mitchum last night at the bonfire . So ? So , what happened ? Nothing . Nothing happened . I went off with Brody Mitchum once . Nothing happened to me , too . You make a big mistake ! ( GROANING ) Okay . Hello , boys . I think you have something that belongs to me . See , I had three aces at that poker table . Next thing I know , you two have them . You better back off . My friend has very big power . Can take you all out . Make you wish you 've never been born . Oh , my God ! Look at this view . Everything looks so pretty when you 're up high . Yes , it does . Thank you . Don 't you ever think what it would be like to just soar over that desert ? Mmm . I took a helicopter ride over Red Rocks Park one time ... I wasn 't thinking in a helicopter . I was thinking more like ... flying . flying ? You know , if I were your husband , I don 't think I 'd let you travel alone . I don 't have a husband . He left . For another woman ? I wish . Man ? I would take that one , too . He 's sort of a criminal , and by " sort of , " I mean that he is . Well , then my questions end there . Thanks . Do you have any kids ? That 's another question . Right . One . Boy genius . Boy ? Boy . I 've got two boys . Not geniuses , just boys . It 's weird having children . Isn 't it ? It 's like you 've got to be two different people . Like the person that they see and the person that you really are ? Something like that , yeah . Yeah . Still married ? Yeah , I am . Happy ? Yes , very . I guess my questions , they stop there . I can 't . I know . I know . I want to . I do . I understand , it 's okay . I had a really great time . Surprisingly . Thank you . Goodnight . Goodnight . It would be a shame to send you back to the congressman covered in bruises . I have to get home to my son . And what are you going to tell your son , huh ? How are you going to explain to your son what happened to you when you didn 't honor your agreement ? Look , I will find another way to pay Linderman . No , Iet me rephrase that question . How are you going to explain to your son what happened to him when you didn 't honor your agreement ? You think about that , Niki . Niki 's not here right now . ( YELLING ) If you threaten our son again , I 'm going to put my heel through your skull . Do you understand ? Do you understand ? Yeah . Yeah . Did you forget something ? ( JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ) What if we went back tomorrow ? Look , I 'm not trying to discount your experience . It 's just a week ago I was in my own country , a respected professor . Now , you want me to stalk a heroin addict ( SLOWING DOWN ) who allegedly paints the future . Mohinder ? BRODY : Yeah , all right . Catch you later , man . AII right , good practice . What are you doing here so late ? Making banners for spirit week . Jackie was going to give me a ride home but she left without me . Can I get a lift ? Yeah , I guess . Thanks . Hey , you drive a stick shift , right ? Can I drive ? Don 't you think it 's a Iittle weird that neither one of us remembers what happened the night of the bonfire ? Must have been some night . Yeah , must have . slow down . That was a red light . Whoops . You know how to drive a stick shift , don 't you ? There 's a Iot of things that I know . Like what you did to me . What 'd I do to you ? I knew it . I knew this would happen . You get drunk , you come on to me and it 's my fault ? You 're a liar . You can 't rape the willing , claire . You wanted it as bad as I did . Stop the car . Did I want it as bad as Lori Trammel ? Lori Trammel is a slut . Is that what you 're going to say about me ? I already do . You 're just going to keep at it , aren 't you ? You should let it go , claire . There 's nothing you can do about it . I can do this . ( SCREAMING ) Just take the one . ( YELLING ) ( POUNDING ) Peter Petrelli . How is this happening ? I 'm sorry if I scared you . You look different without your scar . I don 't know you , buddy . Not yet . My name is Hiro Nakamura . I 'm from the future . I have a message for you .

 The War of the Worlds 2 : THE NEXT WAVE . Nobody saw it coming . Thousands of astronomers looked at Sky looking for extraterrestrial life . But I never knew what hit us . The initial attack was global and devastating . While sailed on the Internet and queuing to buy one ... coffee with soy milk , they just one thing needed to survive . Our blood . But as we harvested , there was something we did not . Fought . All the armies of the world , all inhabitants of the Earth ... to the last microbe came together to send them to where they came . And all over . TWO YEARS LATER . For some , the nightmare began . Come on ! No ! Sissi ! Sissi ! Sissi ! - Bye . - No . Do not leave me ! - Let go . - No ! I will be fine ! - Dad ! - No , Dad . I have to listen to the base always know the rules . Always speak the same , blah , blah , blah . That is , fill the battery up to half , good work . Got to work tonight ? Tonight , tomorrow , any night , you know son . Happy birthday , Dad . What ? I have marked the days , So congratulations . - Where did you get this ? - Spongers . Spongers ? What I have said that ? Do not leave here without me . How surprised if you never are you ? I do not spend anything . - How do you know ? - Will die of boredom . Alex . Thank you for remembering my birthday . You have to understand that you are everything I have . I know . - I will make dinner . - Congratulations . Good morning , Dad . I made breakfast , beans are can , but imagine we are arepas . Alex , get off the bike and get to safety . These are the only batteries . If you promise to stay here until I return , I will bring more . Okay ? - How long ? - 7 or 8 hours . - That is eternal . - Do you have chips . Old . I saved it . Soda and chips , and will be a feast . - I can go with you . - We talked about that . I know there is no outside . Wait here . This is dark , and there is plenty cold . Do not remove the coat . There are two matches . No let the candle goes out . I have an idea . This is my watch . The alarm at 8 hours . I 'll be back before that sounds , I promise . You 're a good man . Base and Laboratory Troops Free . Sixteen . - George . - How are you , Nate ? Glad to see you . - Do you know Victoria ? - Victoria Reilly is a pleasure . He worked for NASA when NASA had . Would participate in the ferry before the invasion . Helps us to decode language of the roads . - How is that ? - After the first invasion ... capture some of the roads . We are decoding . We could replace some codes and to understand some things ... but we lack the key . - For better work fast . - Why ? I think they have returned . There are events here , here and here . The interesting thing is that they are just outside the Earth 's magnetic pole . - When to get that data ? - 4 days ago . - Do you say that about a vortex ? - A change in the field . - The effect Sorshire ? - Possibly . - What is that ? - A hole reversible ... collapsing time and space . It is a theory . And life extraterrestrial , but ... We did many tests simulated before launching the shuttle . None included a hole . What are you doing ? Takes you from point A to B Jumping Imperceptibles time . - Could you go from here to Mars ... ? - A nanosecond . - Exactly . - And we did not see coming the first invasion . - Exactly . - NASA did not detect anything . No data or evidence until it was over . I confirmed my speculations by the sounds of radio . - What is your DC component ? - Batteries . Then only speculate . That 's why I came , you have the equipment , not me . We could analyze the sound and isolate the frequencies . - Victoria , review . - Claro . If there is a pattern intelligent , it will find . Victoria seems to know what you are talking about . George , it should work here . Us . Come live here , you and Alex , it is safer . We have other children , until we have school . Think about it . We can use you . Come , let me show you something . This is part of what we do . Died on the roads first invasion because of a virus . We have experimented with different types , creating a mejunje . - Does she know ? - She created it . Working with us . The virus is the key . We are sure that the removed . Follow me . This is what remains of the first-line defenses . The fleet . - They seem to F22 . - Improved technology . - How is that ? - Victoria created a code ... allowed us to steal technology . We feedback to these fighter to fight in space . - Among other things . - What is the range of altitude ? That is the problem . We know that reach the mesosphere . But we 're not sure reaching the exosfera . - They need to redesign the code . - Right . For that is the walker . We know that there is a field that protected when they enter the exosfera . I teach you a thing . - Is that ... ? - Yes . That 's it . Dead ? Was he alive ? - I believe . - The ship was a way of life ? Ciberbiótico . It 's like anything we 've seen . - We will steal the technology of this ship . - Are you sure you 're dead ? God , I hope . Victoria is within . Let 's see . We believe this is a cell of some sort . There were witnesses who saw took people to the belly of the ship . What happened next ... good . Gentlemen , I want to see this . - Where are we now ? - In the control center . - No windows or fixed geometry ? - Right . But I noticed that this leads this vortex generator . Or so we thought . But in reality what see is a UHF frequency modulator . Well ... comparatively . - How a transmitter ? - Right . Comunica mother to mother these roads . Uses satellites as our beacon . We already knew that the transmission ... of them using a string of octagonal complex numbers ... but so far my team has not able to translate anything . However ... once introduced algorithms of its signal , Mr. Herbert ... discovery of a code . Look at this . Are you alive ? Yes , I try to tell . Introduced frequency signal y . .. iPum ! - Unbelievable . - That is the key . Notify the Mayor . Very good job ! - Cramer Mayor , we need to talk . - Damn , look who came ! - Hello , sir . - Glad to see you , George . How is your wife ? - Sorry , George . And Alex ? - Well , it grows fast . Good . Met George when the invasion . We live together in a time Blackwater . Tremendous family . I am delighted that Alex is okay . Thank you , sir . We believe we found the key . Calculates the trajectory , and I think I found the source of the next attack . There is a possible entry into Rosenbridge . - A leap in time ? - We saw it in my telescope . They are 400 square miles . This was last week . Look at this . This was 4 days . Is this a sunspot or something ? I think that 's mother 's mother . That is the big spot . And these dots ? Cree ships that are lower leaving the hole . Do check it like ? Try to repair the connection the Hubble Space Telescope . If that still works can try to find something . Do this , I must be sure of this . George , stay as coordinator , I 've done all of your stuff . I would like , but I go home with Alex . Bring it to the base . And while Take care of connecting to the telescope . Vicky , the ships ready urgently . Oh , no , the tank is empty . Damn . Sorry . I need fuel . Thank you . Just come by gasoline . I stayed a few miles away empty ago . You are my salvation . What do you have ? Vouchers for food for two weeks . Four coupons ... Three gallons . Three gallons ? This applies as 10 gallons . 10 gallons ? Look , Ok . If you give me your watch , I give you 4 gallons . - I have nothing . - It 's not your lucky day . Dale 3 gallons . - Bastards . - Have a nice day . Dad ? Dad ! ¡ Alex , no ! Why ? Why am I doing this ? I am not the asshole Job ! You can not steal my wife , my son , my life , and leave me here ! The alarm is set for 8 hours . I 'll be back before the ring . I do not spend anything . Sorry , Alex . I am so sorry . Witnesses report that took people to the belly of the ship . What happened then ... nobody knows . You find . I 'll find you . Go ! Go here ! What do you expect ? What are you waiting for ? You 're not dead , if what you thought . - We are alive . - For now , yes . Accept what is , and be grateful . I find my son , Alex . Do not run , man . I told you to flee . They should see it . You faced with this asshole . - Thanks for trying . - You should escape . No , like I was caught . You have to be strong . Do not be afraid or lose hope . God , our Lord is with you . This is bullshit ! I have been inside one of these before . Well , show me the output and out of here . It is not so simple . We have not gone away . We remain on Earth . No ? Trying to kill us or what ? There must be a way out . You must know . Not that I thought would happen . I do not like . I have to find my son . - Mayor . - How far ? We work fast , but we must make a plan B. There is no plan B. Must attacking the mother ship . These ships are not more beyond 150 km. and knows it . Need to go at least 600 km . in order to attack this thing . You can do work faster . - Raya . - Mr. - Talk to me . - It 's difficult but we will . We have uploaded infectious agents lung in aircraft . - But not just yet . - How many are loaded ? - This ship has 5 . - Virus ? - Yes . - Raya , we are there . Lord . - You should design a ground assault . - Tell her to work faster . Norman , as are we going ? My squad must go to exosfera . We need protection . I 'm going codes should be ready in minutes . Hopefully coordinates George work . That 's it . Does the ship moves ? Ok , are in the air already . Back , back ! I have . What was that ? - The sonic barrier , sir . - What ? They are . Entered the atmosphere . - Mayor . - Tell Vicky we need ... ships in the air of urgency . If destroy the ships come ashore . - Maybe too late already . - Why , what happened ? There are reports of all parts of the world . Has begun the attack . - Sir , I 'm done . - Start launch . Sequence starting pitching . Well , listen . This is the mission . Attack the mothership . Is just outside our atmosphere . We believe that if we destroy the mother , the rest will fall . For most of us , this is a round trip . Not everyone can survive . Follow my instructions . Than anyone take risky decisions . Good luck , men . Ready , Vicky ? Forward . Guys , I 'm not doing that . Do not worry for now . We are promoting . Is only the first stage , we continue after the launch . Stay ... quiet . Come on . Breathe . ¡ Respira ! Follow me . Come on . Come on ! Do not touch the walls ! Alex ! Pete ! It is the second time that I owe you a living . I have to find my son . Is this my blood ? Is thing it feeds on us ? Would drown my shit ! Run ! And do not touch the walls ! - Help me , help me ! - I got you , do not fight ! We told you not to touch the walls ! And here ! Do not touch the walls , do not touch walls . And she goes into a ? - He said that follow . - Where ? I do not know , but we can not stay here . Shit ! Wait , I think I have something . No , shit . - Where are we ? - 20 km . Is 80 km. before the mesosphere . Have you managed to run the code ? Still , no ? We need such protection or all will die ! Still working on the code . Are still in the atmosphere . A craft to my right , at 3 . The satellites are to least two dozen ships . - Sir , permission to fly . - Do not fly , stay in formation ! Listen well . Not attacked . Again , not attacking . They 're too much ! - Alfa , follow me . - Charlie , stay in formation . Háblenme . How are we going ? We can not over ! We have fire , sir ! Extinguish the fire , do not use the weapons . Leave it to the mothership . - The shield is working . - How far to go ? - How long do you need ? - 20 minutes . Stay well 20 minutes . I can not give you that time , my men are falling . We must go now . I have to give half back . Stay direction . We are too close , focus . It is too fast , we can not . We are approaching the mesosphere . We have to go now ! Still missing 95 km . If it hurts them . Again , confirm . I do not have . We can not over ! The ship is going to burn ! - 97 . - Get out of there , can not come back . Load . I got it ! Work . You succeeded ? We did it ! It was not so difficult . Really ? Thank God they are alive . Can you see the mother ship ? Repeat . The ship ! Do you see the mother ship ? Yes , base . We have visual contact . Is large . Alfa here . Formulas to attack the ship . What is that ? That is white , is increasing in size . Base , see this ? - It is an opening . - An open ? Yes , look . It is a mass disruption . Spreads . Lord , is a gap in time . What makes the ship ? Lord . I think it ate to the mothership . What happened ? Where are they ? Quick , write this coordinate . Z 300 . And no 483 . X 59 . 65 degrees . - What is that ? - What just happened . Dios mio . Where were they ? I guess that was where the mother ship . - Where are we ? - At home , baby ! We did it , we are Land . Do not leave the planet . We went outside . Something is wrong . Do you know what was wrong ? Whore chupasangre ship . That was wrong . - Where you going ? - For the girl who saved us . If you did that , you can find the ship again . Well thought out . Get out , and now want to return to that nightmare . Continue on your path , not I want you to waste your time . - Can I leave ? - This is my fight ! You fight , really ? That thing removed nearly all my people on the street 32 . The last time they killed my girl . Think you do not miss taken by the hand ? Talk to my brother or my mom ? Do you fight ? Please . This not only is you find your son . Is somewhat higher than that . For me this is just to find my son . I know this. iLO 've seen , man ! Have post-traumatic syndrome ! Facing reality . My mistake , sorry sorry. iEspera , wait ! Come on , sorry , sorry . I have stress syndrome or something . Based here in the Greater Cramer the vessel head . Respond please . Nothing. iHijo of a bitch ! Shit ! Watch this . We will ride in style . Air conditioning . Such Having found someone else . Here are the keys . The battery is dead . There are more than one way to turn it on . It has no motor . Alfa here . Someone copying me ? Alfa here . Is anybody there ? - Alpha . - Raya . God . ¡ Alfa Rickler here ! What the hell was that ? We took a leap in time . I thought that was shit lies . Lord . Is that Mars ? Affirmative . Give me a report of their condition . The fuel cells to 25 % . Ok . All ships maintain their current position . It is best to see what lies ahead . Copying , Alfa . Man , that vessel filled me with fuck . I do not feel well . Wait . I need water , I die of thirst . - This is not right . - What ? We need a plan . I ... We need to get on a roof reviewing the area . See where we are . Stay here . I 'll be back . Well . Good idea , I 'll stay here . I 'm tired . Go back , right ? That ship sure sucks throughout the world , George . Maybe we were just you and me . Here we are not safe . - Who are you ? - The same as you . - Is there more ? - Only one . Is it so disappointing ! Quiet , busco someone . A child of 10 years , Alex . - I know Alex . - Yes ? - Have you seen him ? - Not here . Him .. - What ? - My brother died with my dad . - I was alone . - Sorry .

Is it contagious ? How do we expect Loquita ? - Only two ? - There was more . Some were lost ... and I followed . I did the best I could y . .. You did good . Did Well , Sissy . You did good . - But they are only two . - We are double . You are very brave . Let me see . Come on . I 'm George , it 's Pete . - Chaquefer . - Are there others ? Were . We are only Sissy and me . Walkers ? They must be thirsty . The process of filtrate left a bad taste in the mouth . If neither of jokes . - Want something stronger ? - Yes , lightning , yeah ! Filtering Process ? Following the initial invasion of microbes in the blood are lethal to them . But the blood is crucial for survival . The answer is ... mix the blood . Experience which is the best way to do it . Those caught in the gaps and store the blood until ... refine the process . Others are alive and experiment with them . - Others ? - Children . Do children ? Damn ! Not bad . We have to get used to , is synthetic . - Brandy ? - More or less . Here the whole process . - Why ? - There are no resources . It is difficult to get things on Mars . Does anyone else get this show ? Positive alpha . Something pulls me . Copying , Raya , I too . What the hell ? Seem to us to visit . I do not recall that on Mars have images of this site . If the disease have they affected the head . Technically are still on the ship . The ship is on Mars . This site is a good experiment . They created it to recreate our society . - How does a mouse cage ? - Exactly . But we refuse to run on the wheel . - They are crazy . - Are not we on Earth ? I have not been on Earth for two years . Two years ? We caught the first invasion . Soon there were others . I ... I escaped . Sissy was the first children . Do you see what I see ? Do nothing . Something tells me that only will have a chance . When you tell , sir . - Kill the pain . - It kills your brain cells . I understand that it is difficult to assimilate . Sissy can show you . No , I do not want to return . Many bad memories . George . Do not believe in that crazy , right ? I have to find out . This is crazy . - What else can I do ? - This is as real as I am . A half recreated ? Jaula mice ? Why favor ! Alli . It is the emergency exit . Nobody ever uses it . Take care . Go on , boss . I protect you . Here on Earth to the Mayor Cramer . Please respond . We really have nobody in the fleet . Neither army . Or militia . Asi es . Want emborracharte ? Okay , guys . Resist entering in the Martian atmosphere . Alfa here . Do all went ? - Affirmative , Sweet here . - Copy all here . - Ok , guys . - Going back to training . Now . Holy Mother of Christ . Sweet , on the left . Attempts to reach the ship . No Check out this battle . We use the missiles . Sidewall left . Enter count of three . Copying , Alfa . Crap . Go ahead , advanced . I will . Concentrate . I 'm close . Calm , all me . Seven . Six . Well , gather the resources we can and get back to the ship . Hear what he said , kept alive to children , Alex should be there . - It 's a suicide . - Relax , Don liquor . There are miles of tunnels . We caught before you get close . - I take them , but ... - What 's wrong ? During the time they experienced with Sissy , was a superstar . He did everything and survived . Mixtures of several viruses created a kind of supergripe . - How not to kill her ? - The killing , but more slowly . - She hit the ? - Not exactly , I ... Attacks before they could distribute them . - I got infected , but too late . - So Sissy returned to the ship . That is why we are here now . I do not understand . You are part of the resistance . Resistance ? You , me , this half-dead and the insane ? - Just for me to recover my son . - Your son is only a part of everything . The question is ... How far where you 're ready to go ? To save it . - What do you think that ? - The Martian Armageddon . With this in your system , when you take the ship ... Your blood will contaminate the rest . If all the blood is contaminated , will not survive . That will kill the ship . In the long run will the center of the system , I do not know where he is . - Sorry , but no thanks . - I know where your son , George . I know . You can release it . Back to embrace . It is a round trip . If you accept , Sissy will show you where you are . There must be another way . This guy is dying . Do not do this . Tell me where is my son . Tell me where you are ! God . No . You okay ? We can resolve this . Stay with me . I knew where my son . Knew he was alive . And what we find . I find it . Is that part of Mars ? Look for Alex ! The planes we can take home , George . If we find them . Find a door . To find my son . That girl know . We to find the nuts . - I went . - How do you know ? Find it . I tell you crazy you can help . George , we must out of here . Now ! That is my one way . No , no ! Oh God ! You okay ? You 're Live ! Breathe , breathe . Does the music of Twinkle , bright star ? It 's Alex . Take care . Do not touch the wall . Here . Over here . Come on . I do not want him . We gotta go now , George . Come on ! Come on , come on . A second , follow me . Rays . What the hell is that thing ? It is the brain , Pete . It 's like being reported . We gotta go . Wait , this will help me . - What do you do with that ? - We must give him a dose . - I do not use needles , partner . - Get me out blood . - What are you doing , Dad ? - Wow ! Quiet . I do not like this , no I like needles . - Quiet , quiet . - You okay , Dad ? This sucks . - Dad ! - Do you hear that ? We gotta go now . Now ! Stay close , Alex . Do not touch the walls . Come on , jump . Come on ! Reverse the motor principal to go from here . - If anyone can , you can . - Hopefully . Over here . - IMayor ! - Alex ? What are you doing here ? Arrive in good time we go from here . - Be somebody ? - There is a lot . Prepare to meet the ships and all those who can . We 're going now . Come on , guys ! We gotta get out of here . The ship fell . Sit down here , buddy . I got something for you . Put this on . I will your instructions . Resist , George . Do not worry , your father will be fine . George , resist , mate . Resist , Dad . Get us out of here , Alex . We need to locate the vortex hopping in time . I think I have something . Victoria , we need the coordinates of the jump . - Victoria , go ahead . - There they are . You hear me ? Need the coordinates for the jump . There are there . C300 . And negative 43 . X 59 . 65 degrees . We have ! We have , boys . See you at home . Hold on everybody , let 's jump . THREE MONTHS AFTER - Where did you learn to cook well ? - Some of the benefits of the prison . - Disciplinary action ? - That I am afraid , sir . It was good for us today . Excellent . Thank you . Did you finish , Alex ? Can I get up ? Clear . All this has been difficult for him . It 's just a child . If . How you doing , buddy ? Well . I know I have a lot to think about . I just want you to know that we are all friends . - If you want to talk about something , say so . - Okay . This world is a place where kids as we have to mature quickly . I am very proud of as things got , Alex . - I miss my dad . - Me too . ¡ Man ! Damn . Dad , come ! God , gentle champion . - Is still fragile , Alex . - I take care . I count on that , son . - Mayor . - George . I am very happy to see you . Pete ! - Welcome . - Nice to see you , Vicky . Tremendo clock , man . - I gave it to my dad . - Really ?

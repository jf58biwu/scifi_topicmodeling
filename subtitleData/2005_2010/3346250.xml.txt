Oh yeah . I saw him race years ago . He was good . He did some time upstate . Killed his career . Holder of the fastest laps at Willard , Union , and Butler .

Suppose you rape kiddies too You hear that everyone ? The guy kills women ... rapes kiddies . What do you think we gonna do about that ? Get on the ground , now ! Nobody move ! Nobody move ! I guess he didn 't like the oatmeal either . Prisoner No. 77119 , ma 'am . Thank you , Mr. Ulrich This prison is the home to murderers , rapists .. .. And violent offenders of every kind . The United States Penal System sends me the worst of the worst . But the men you 've provoked .. Well , let 's just say Mr. Ames that the life term you 've joined us for may be a lot shorter than you think . I understand tradition . Soften up the new guy And a slipping good time had by all . Foul language is an issue .. for me . While looking over your record , I couldn 't help noticing your occupational history . It seems you have some talent behind the wheel . Out of curiosity , when was the last time you raced ? It 's been a while . I lost my license . What if I could help you ? Get my license back ? I had something else in mind . You 're familiar with the Death Race , and the driver the fans call Frankenstein ? A man so disfigured by crashes , that he 's forced to wear a mask . His return to the track is highly anticipated .. And therein lies my problem . No one knows yet , but poor Frank died on an operating table Not long after his last race . Anyone can wear the mask , But not just anyone can drive the car . You have the skills required to keep the legend alive . I want you to become Frankenstein . No thanks . He 's dead . Why don 't you just tell the truth ? The audience wants to see Frank again . He moves them . Inspires them . And in this world that 's not so easy to come by . What makes you think for a second , I would risk my life doing this for you ? Win five races , you go free . Those are the rules And Frank has won four . Win one more , you walk . Call it intuition , but I don 't think you belong in here with the rest of these animals . I might surprise you . The race is Friday , and I need your decision . You 're a skilled driver . Your chances are good I 'm offering you your freedom , Mr. Ames . If it 's not worth risking your life for , what is ? Now turn her up , and tie the lines . Ma 'am You don 't have to call me Ma 'am , you know that . This is Mr Ames You know why he 's here . I do now .. Race is less than a week away I have great confidence in you . Well then , I 'll leave you two to get acquaintant . Jensen Garner Ames . Moved to the states at twenty-four years old . Named after a car , the Jensen Intercepter . A three time local speedway champion . You 've done your homework , or do you just know everything ? Jensen Intercepter . I had one . Handled like a school bus . Call me Coach , everyone does . Gunner .. Lists . This 's Frank . I 'll show you around We have a fully functioning autoshop . Just like you 'd find in the outside world . Each team has their own shop . We don 't help them , They don 't help us . With the inmates you 're Jensen Ames , new greasemonkey . Nobody will know you 're Frank , except us on the team , and a handful of the guards . Nobody will talk . How can you be so sure ? - Hennessey .. In here , she 's Judge , Jury and Executioner The race is her baby . Anyone who threatens it , she kills . The audience for the race is half , since Frank has been out of the game And so is the corporations profit Thats why she needs you . What 's back there ? Thats a good question . Hennessey has had a whole wing of the prison in isolation for a month . Working on something . Time to meet the monster . Mustang V8 Fastback Took the best , and made it better . That 's a V8 Rouch 5.4 liter , with a Ford Racing supercharger . Putting out 850 horsepower , and close to .. 750lbs. of torque with sequential module port fuel injection . Looks like there 's a 250HP NOS unit . Just in case . Then we had some fun , Customizing a personal protection package . 3 quarter inch steel plate , front , sides . Bulletproof glasses will here .. here .. and there . And in the rear .. the 6 inch solid steel shield we call 'The Tombstone' Oil .. Smoke And napalm for defence . Twin 30mm belt fed machine guns for offense . So where 's the ammo ? We get that on race day . Pity . Yeah , everyone thinks that ... the first time . Thinks what ? About turning the guns on the guards . About escaping . No , I wasn 't thinking that . Well I 'm glad , because Hennessey 's got electric kill switches on all the guns on all the cars . And all the guard towers are fortified , and their guns are bigger than your guns . Oh , did I mention the helicopters and also the fact that we 're on an island here a mile from the nearest shoreline ? The only way in or out of here is on that one skinny bridge you came in on . What 's that ? The most important part of the car . The race takes place in 3 stages over 3 days . The first two stages you just gotta try and get rid of as much of the competition as you can . While getting your own skinny ass over the line alive . Third stage is where speed counts First one over that line wins . Tomorrow morning you 'll meet your navigator Case . She 'll help you navigate the course , reload your weapons , and help with the running of the car . I 'd like to talk to her ahead of time before the race . Yeah , I 'd like a big-tittied girl to lick peanut butter off my toes . But it ain 't gonna happen . This is still a prison , man . She 's a chick . They get bussed in from the women 's facility upstate . It 's all about ratings . Fast cars , pretty women ... Machine Gun Joe 's the only one that has male navigators , 'cause he 's gay . Actually it 's because he goes through them so fast , and audience gets squeamish . Yeah he goes through them ... through their ass . He cuts each kill into his skin as a souvenir , right here . What about the rest of the drivers ? Lists ? 14K First generation Chinese-american . 10th generation Triad . His father sent him to business school He 's the only man in here who holds a degree from the MIT He 's killed 4 men off the track ( That we know of ) Another 7 on it . Hector Grimm , The Grimm Reaper . The man is a master. clinical psychopath . Three time consecutive life sentences . He 's killed 6 men off the track , Another 12 on it . You 've already met the local chapter of The Brotherhood . Their driver , Pachenko , has killed 9 men on the track . Nobody knows how many off . Travis Colt , our local superstar . Used to race for NASCAR . - Yeah , he was good too . Until he fell asleep behind the wheel of his Mercedez , with the help of a bottle of scotch and a handful of ludes . Wiped out the entire patio of Moscala , sent a dozen people to the hospital ... Killed three of them . Technically , best driver in here but a mean son of a bitch quitter . Ladies .. I hear your man Frank 's still in the infirmary with 15 unhealed fractures I also hear he 's not gonna make the race . You hear a lot . Who 's the new fish ? Greasemonkey . Well well . Monkey . I got a new name for you .. Igor Because you about the ugliest motherfucker out here in this prison yo ! It 's funny , huh ? You tell Frank when you see him This race is between me and him . This time won 't be infirmary , it 'll be the morgue . I 'll be sure to pass it on . Lets get out of here .. Man , that 's one angry homo . Who 're they ? Work detail .. Get to work on the track , for good behavior . Those are GPS tracking bracelets . In case someone decides to go for a swim .. The ring . This was the old Frank 's . It got melted to his hand . Frankenstein ! Frankenstein ! Frankenstein ! Asshole He 's all yours . Don 't talk to the other drivers . Frank never did . Part of the mystique . Let the mask do the work . Here comes trouble .

You wanted a monster ? You 've got one . She has your eye . They 're her mother 's . So why do you wear a number , Coach ? Because I 'm not a prisoner . I qualified for parole 3 years ago .

She said she signed my release papers . It 's my life back . I didn 't kill him . And you killed him too ... He wouldn 't quit . I just wanted to make sure he didn 't win .

Release the Dreadnaught . Coach ! Well I guess we know what she was buildin ' now ... Activate weapons . Christ ! Coach , any ideas ? - Just have to tough it out I guess . Hennessy will take it off once she 's pumped up the ratings . You sure about that ? The hell is that thing going ? Fuck me .. Lists . Receiving ? Need to patch me through to another car . On it ... Joe ! Who is this ? - Frank - What do you want ? How about we play a little offense ? I hope you know what you 're doing . Now that 's entertainment . Damn it ! Frankenstein ! Frankenstein ! Nice reflexes there , Igor . Race car reflexes . You look lost pal . Not this time . Got this feeling that you and Frank are close . Real close That weird accent , you even kind of sound like him . I was wondering ... what if you ... got in an accident . Would that throw Frank off his game a little bit ? I doubt it . The sick fucked up guy that he is . He 's cool . He just want to kill you ? So I guess I 'll ... see him later , right ? Let 's roll . Ma 'am with all respect ... What 're we going to do ? - We 're going to kill him of course . You want me to kill Frankenstein ?

What the hell do you want another half gallon for ? Coach . Let 's give the man what he wants . Where are you going ? This is not good Real brave coming over here . I 'm gonna win this race , because I want out of this shit hole . I 've already won 3 races . Two more , and I 'm smoking cohebas in Miami . Frank might wanna think about that . Because I 'm gone ... outta here . Then maybe it 's his turn . Maybe he 's thinking it 's the other way around . From here on out , stay the fuck out of my pit . Hey ! Think you and Frank should have a little talk . Welcome to the final installment of Death Race . Seven men dead . Siad Grim Colt Pachenko Carson Riggins , and 14K are all dead .

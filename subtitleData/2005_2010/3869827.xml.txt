 Is that ... part of that a Bell Howell spectroscope ? Surprise . I repurposed it . Without asking me ? I 'm gonna say this once . Are you listening ? Back off ! Just do as you 're told , please . The vibes . - It happens all the time . - So why do you trust them ? One time I didn 't , and I should have . My dad was ... a fireman . He died that night in a house fire , saving a couple kids . Apparently Martino and your partner were having an affair , and he was married . Her history doesn 't bother you ? I read the press release of what went down in Denver . You 're a hero . - Lives were saved . - Lives were lost . Want to do a shot ? Sorry , I don 't drink . Sure you do . Do I know you ? I haven 't had a drop in five years . 'cause you drank enough for a lifetime the night you killed me ... You killed me ... killed me . It was an accident . It was an accident . I was 17 . It was prom night . I 'm so ... sorry . - Please ... - Lee , what are you doing ? - Lee , talk to me . - No , doc , I gotta ... I have to get away from her . Damn it ! You 're going to jail , missy ! Better safe than sorry , right ? What are you talking about ? Unexplained suicides up in Riverton . We are off to see the warden . You use soap on a rope ? I don 't judge your personal hygiene products . Although you might wanna invest and get some moisturizers . - You look a little dry around the nose . - You want to swap beauty tips . We can talk about the hair sprouting from your shoulders , your nose , and your ... ears ! Or , you could just tell me about the prison suicides . Well , let 's go with the suicides . Inventory ! What a bone . Tycho Brahe 's snot pocket . Check . This place is falling apart . Venus de Milo 's arms . Rad . You know what ... I cannot work under these conditions . What you doin ' ? Rebuilding a carburetor . That 's funny . I mean , what 's the tune ? Something I 've been working on for my father . How old is your father ? No , that 's really good for you . Can I have the keys to the cherry picker ? Why ? And no , you can 't . To fix this lightbulb . It 's flickering , annoying . Just let it go , Claudia . It 's just gonna burn out , and I 'll have to fix it later . Here 's the thing , these bulbs never burn out ... They 're Shelby bulbs , invented by Adolphe Chaillet 108 years ago . So no need ... What am I doing even talking to you ? I am busy . I will tighten the bulb later . Fine . I know you have a corner on the whole vibe thing , but this place is creepy . Well , maybe it just needs a woman 's touch . Agents Bering and Lattimer . Sorry to keep you waiting . A tropical storm is heading this way , and the preparations are endless . I 'm Corinne Huggins , the warden . I 'm not sure what the Secret Service 's interest is in all this , - but I expect to be kept in the loop . - Of course . Good . This way . Riverton hadn 't had a suicide in two years . Now , including Donaldson , we 've had four in the past month . His parole had just come through , right ? He had reconciled with his wife , and he was looking forward to being with his family . Not a very high risk for suicide . None of them were . All four were model prisoners . Had anything new been brought in before the first suicide ... Furniture , artwork ? Agent Lattimer , this is a maximum-security facility , not a college dormitory . There 's been nothing new . No woman 's touch . - Right . Of course . - What about new inmates ? There 's been a freeze on intake . We 've been operating over-capacity since before I took over . And when was that ? Just over a month ago . Just before the first suicide . I bet she 's got some demonic tchotchke on her desk that she uses as a paperweight . Okay , I take back the " woman 's touch " comment . My predecessor had been here quite a few years . There hasn 't been much time to look at paint chips . You killed me , killed me , bunny . As it is , we 've had to store his things in the anteroom closet until his estate is out of probate . Okay , so this prisoner Donaldson didn 't leave a suicide note . Mind if I look through his stuff ? You killed me , bunny ... These are his personal effects . Coo-ell ! Love that . Ouroboros . It 's a snake . It 's a symbol of self-reflection and cyclicity . And the best Rush album since Roll the Bones . Snakes Arrows rocks . Written by one of our inmates . His path to salvation . Creepy . Who 's John Hill ? Though we 're surrounded by concrete and razor wire , I can show you more freedom than the men who hold the keys . What 's he in for ? He killed his wife . A lot . Darkness has descended on this house . Death has returned to Riverton . And those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it . Dr. Cooper 's ready for y 'all . Regret has no place in your life . Your only salvation is here . Projet-SG ( 1.00 ) If you won 't let me use the cherry picker , then how am I ... No way . What every fashionable girl is wearing this fall . Awesome ! Suck it , Magneto ! Sweet . I can totally see my house from here . This is mildly disconcerting . Great . Now we know they last 108 years . Do you think freaky cult leaders are born with crazy eyes , or is it some sort of corrective surgery ? Pete , what is it ? - You don 't see that ? - See what ? That guy standing there . It 's my dad . So Pete saw his father , but you didn 't , right ? But I should probably mention that I saw Sam earlier . What ? Why didn 't you say anything ? Well , you know , Sam 's dead . And your father 's dead . You can understand my reticence , right ? You 're both hallucinating ? When were you gonna mention that to me ? Well , we just did . What ... what was that ? Tropical storm Inez . You didn 't say that there was a storm . Why is that important ? How many times do I have to tell you about electrical energy ? It can crank up the intensity of an artifact , I don 't know , tenfold . And if an artifact is causing these hallucinations , then a powerful electrical charge can make these visions seem real . They seem pretty real now . You 'll have to stay in constant contact . You got that ? Constant . I don 't care if you have nothing to say , every hour you 're gonna call me , okay ? You 're gonna find out everything about the inmates who killed themselves . Start with the last one , Lee Donaldson . According to your statement , Lee said something before he jumped . " I have to get away from her " , he said . I can only think he meant Claire . That 's the girl he killed in the hit and run , right ? He quit drinking , but never forgave himself for taking a life . Guilt 's a powerful thing . He was your trustee , right ? More than that . We were friends . I 'm trained in recognizing the warning signs . I don 't know why I didn 't see them . Did Lee have any enemies ? John Hill . Riverton 's self-proclaimed messiah , leading his personal religious cult . Lee was an early convert , but after Hill started capitalizing on the suicides , Lee saw what he really was ... An opportunist preying on fear . Lee got out , and Hill didn 't like losing one of his lambs . Hill may have strange religious beliefs , but he 's harmless . I don 't particularly like what he has to say , but you can 't deny the calming effect on some of the inmates . How are we today , Mr. Hill ? Another day above ground , warden . Another day above ground . Indeed . These are agents Bering and Lattimer . They 'd like to ask you some questions . I 'll be in my office . Where 'd you get that necklace ? You could say it 's always been with me . Or you could say where you got it . The object itself is of no importance . Its value lies in what it represents . And what is that ? Some demand that we consume ourselves with remorse for our supposed sin . Ouroboros reminds us to transcend the cycle and walk the path to enlightenment . No remorse ? What about the path to parole ? I was and am his instrument on earth . And with my hands , it 's his will and not mine that is done . To feel remorse ... is to shame God . What about those who are remorseful ? Like Donaldson . His death revealed his greater purpose . Man cannot be saved without sacrifice . I see . That 's a neat trick . Now you get to tell your boys you can protect them from sacrifice , like Donaldson . My followers are free because they know the way to freedom . You killed me , bunny . The cruelest prison is the one that we build for ourselves out of fear and regret . No . This isn 't real . This can 't be real . Sam again ? I can 't ... move ! Okay , no need to panic . Just take off the coat . Can 't take off the coat . Okay , new plan . I 'm so getting grounded . Incoming ! Better you than me . This is the last one . - What is it you 're looking for ? - I 'm not sure . - Anomalies , patterns . - Riots . - That 's a little specific , but sure . - No , look . For decades , Riverton was known as the snake pit . Dozens of inmates went insane here . Then , in 1979 , during hurricane David , there were uncontrollable riots . I mean , the place almost burned down . Six months later it was closed . Reopened a year later under warden Matthews . He was here until he died last month . So what did he do differently ? Warden ? Are you okay ? I beg your pardon . The week is catching up with me . I was just asking what Matthews did differently to whip this place into shape . He was very religious . He instituted daily prayers . He swore it turned the place around . That 's him . This looks familiar . Check out what he got rid of when he moved in . And no more riots . He wasn 't a very tolerant man . Anything he thought was pagan he had taken out . Well , let 's go see the good reverend . Good-bye snakes and arrows . - And that should take care of that . - I had your permission to wear that . I 'm not sure I understand . What , exactly , is the danger ? I 'm sorry , we can 't disclose that information . I was quite clear , you get free reign of my institution I get some answers . Please don 't misconstrue our silence as disrespect . It 's just beyond our authority to tell you . But I 'm pretty sure there won 't be any more suicides . Cause of death , brain hemorrhage due to blunt-force trauma . Final report to come . You could have helped me , doctor . I 'm sorry . I tried ... I did . I thought you were my friend . You ignored the warning signs . You let me die , doctor . Stop ! I 'm your friend . - I tried . - You killed me , doctor . Listen to me ! You told me the suicides would stop . Now we have another one . Clearly you 're not able to help . And you 're not being truthful with me about what 's going on . I promise you , warden , we have told you everything we know . Really ? And what , exactly , are you looking for ? Well , it could be anything . Look , sometimes freaky stuff causes other freaky stuff to happen . After the storm passes , I expect you two to be gone . I 'm gonna request a federal team of investigators . Okay , so he was here alone , and he was depressed about Donaldson . Medical examiners record their autopsy findings . Maybe he has a recorder - around here somewhere . - Right . So look for one . Well ... Fine . I 'll do it . - I 'm over here . - I 'll do it . God ... sorry , I just wanna look here . Okay , play it . I 'm sorry . I tried , I did . Lee , I 'm sorry . You are my friend . So now he 's talking to the dead guy . He should know better . He 's a doctor . What 's that static sound ? Did you hear that ? - Play it again . - Okay . Lee , I 'm sorry . I tried , I did . I 'm sorry ! You are my friend . - Did you hear that ? - Sounded like bad cell phone service . 10 000 cycles per second . It can be the electrical interference that any natural material makes when it vibrates . - Okay , so where does it come from ? - Any number of minerals or heavy metals or it can be an artifact that contains both . Just give me a second . Just one ... - Okay . Does that sound familiar ? - That 's it . So , we 're looking for some kind of a mineral artifact that causes hallucinations . Is that banging ? Do you hear ... No , you do that but I ... - What ... - No , I 'm okay , I 'm okay . I just ... You know what , we got it . Thanks . We 'll call you later . Yeah , all right . S ... SOS ? Hi , Artie . Funny story . So I kind of ... tried to fix this lightbulb , even know you expressly told me not to . And man , have I learned my lesson ! You 're so right about this place . You just never know what to expect . Okay , you 're pissed . Can we move past that part for now and get to the part where you get me down from here ? That wouldn 't be Volta 's lab coat that you 're wearing ? All part of the hilarious story I should really tell you when I 'm back on planet earth . The reason , that Volta 's lab coat is in the Warehouse , is because Volta couldn 't control its magnetic field . As you may have noticed , each metallic object that it connects to makes the coat stronger and stronger . That explains so much . Thank you . My glasses ! Those better not be scratched ! You know , when I was in girl scouts , we would make these little mini metal detectors so we could hunt for gold . Most speakers are coated with a polymer film that picks up VHF frequencies . But we never found any gold . But we did find a lot of worthless minerals . Are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah . I want you to know that you can tell me things . I got the report about Denver . What 'd it say ? I don 't know ... I didn 't read it . Intellectually , I know I did everything by the book . Of course you did . You 're you . What if I missed something , Pete ? What if it 's my fault ? The only person responsible for Sam 's death is the piece of garbage that pulled the trigger that day . You protected the president . That 's the gig . You 're a hero , and so is Sam . Okay ? - Yeah . - Okay ? - That 's a cool-ass science project . - Yeah , it 's ... Now , it 's ... It 's not working . - Sounds like it 's working . - No , it 's not . It 's just crackling at everything . - Maybe there 's minerals everywhere . - Look , how can there be ... minerals . The miners ' mine . They are everywhere , including in the ground . Come on . Thank you . I 'm sorry about the ... Look . Quartz mines . Quartz . Do you see ? This building was built on an old quartz mine . And back then , indigenous materials would have been used - when building a new structure . - Quartz , as in the mineral ? As in hallucination inducer . As in this whole freaking structure is one giant tuning fork , and mother nature 's just banging away . Okay , now , I 've got these magnets . They 're attached to this thing . When I let go , they 're coming right at you . They 'll stick to you and the stuff near you . Okay , here they come . Okay , they 're on . Would it have killed you to put a warning label on this thing ? And say what ? " Only put on in case of stupid " ? Just bottom line this for me , Artie . - Worst-case scenario ? - Why not ? All the Warehouse buckles in on itself , crushing us both to death . Okay , yeah , I changed my mind . Sugarcoat it . Okay , it must be the storm because I can 't get any reception . Okay , so the whole building is causing the hallucinations , right ? So maybe we should start thinking about what stopped them for 30 years . Okay , so the prison opens . - Right . - There 's a hurricane . Suddenly there 's a ton of violence . The prison closes . It reopens with a new warden , and suddenly the violence stops . He dies . His stuff goes into storage . The suicides start . I don 't know ... Maybe the old bible banger had something that was curing the crazy . Right . Maybe this is what Mrs. Frederic meant by " endless freaking wonder . " - Let 's go . - Let 's get out of here . 'Cause we did not see that . - Warden Huggins ? - No ! Warden , what 's wrong ? It 's locked . - Have you got the keys ? - Stop . Stop . I 'm sorry ! Okay , he 's cuckoo for coa puffs . Warden , it 's agent Bering . Are you all right ? Get back , Dr. Cooper ! That 's not true . - Look out . Let me bust the door down . - But it 's a ... It 's a warden 's door . It 's probably sturdier than most . I wish you would 've said that about five seconds ago . No , no ! Get away from me ! That 's not a good sign . We have to go through the ex-warden 's stuff . You can 't keep us out * * * You never controlled this prison . How many more have to die by your hand . How much " world 's greatest warden " crap can you have ? - We don 't know what we 're looking for . - Why would this time be any different ? Give me the farnsworth . I 'm gonna try Artie again . It appears that Riverton is now the land of the blind . And we are its one-eyed kings . Just a minute . Artie , thank god . Okay , what shuts down quartz ? Of course , it 's quartz . It 's quartz , right . That makes perfect sense . I should have thought of quartz . Okay , listen . Pierre Curie and his brother Jacques , they proved the existence of a converse effect of piezoelectricity . - You know what that is , don 't you ? - Yeah . So what you 've gotta do is you ... Help ! Sorry . The frequency of a piece of quartz can be completely cancelled out by its proximity to a second piece of quartz . Now , the second piece is probably what the artif ... I 'm having a little ... with the image breaking up . It 's a large piece , okay ? ... parts of ... - Is the storm worse ? - A lot . When you find the artifact , you gotta put it exac ... exactly ... before be ... proximity ... the original frequency ... essential ... Okay , big piece of quartz in the closet . Hello . Can we get back to me , Artie ? There 's a bicycle on me . We 're gonna have to reduce the magnetic field . But we 're gonna do it very gradually . We have to do that just because we wouldn 't want to destroy your central nervous system . No . No , we wouldn 't . We would not . Hey , what is that ? That sounds bad . What is that ? Box of crap . Box of crap . Warden , whatever you 're seeing , it 's not real . You 're perfectly safe . It 's the cross . New plan . But listen , you have to do exactly , exactly as I say . Got that ? You 're the man . Stay right there . What ? Bingo ! You found it ? What is it that they say about those who live by the sword ? Stand aside , please . Is that some sort of prison term for " you 're a dead woman " ? I can 't take the door off its hinges if you 're standing in front of it . You really think we 're gonna let you in there ? If the prison is in an uproar , that means the warden is in trouble . She 's always supported my work . I would like to help . Target has arrived . Repeat , target has arrived . It 's happening again . - You should have warned me , Petey . - Dad ? If you knew I was never coming home , why didn 't you say something ? Repeat , target 's on the move . Let 's move in . Negative . Negative . The plan is to extract at the stairs . Sam , wait ! I was a kid . It was just a feeling . - I was afraid . - Well , it 's time to be a man , take responsibility for your actions , your fears , your regrets . - It 's your fault . You were late . - Was I ? You killed me , bunny . Now you 've gotta make it right . It 's time to pay the price , boy . The cruelest prison is the one we build for ourselves out of fear and regret . What ? Not a day goes by that I don 't miss you . But you would have gone to work that morning whether I would have warned you or not . - And I have no more regret ... - Regret ... about not stopping you . - And I have no more fear ... - Out of fear ... - that I did the wrong thing . - Regret has no place in your life . It wasn 't my fault . It 's just , it 's who you were , and who I try and be every day of my life . The cruelest prison is the one that we build for ourselves . Stay away from me , Sam ! Myka , listen to me . You can fight this . You know what happened in Denver . All your planning and preparations , they weren 't enough . You know the truth . Don 't be afraid of it . This is the report . Remember ? You know what 's in it . Don 't be afraid . Sam said I killed him . That 's not the truth . Listen , you don 't need a report to tell you what you already know in your heart . You did everything right . Sam didn 't listen to you . That 's why he 's dead . He screwed up . Not you . Do you understand ? Now , tell Sam the truth . I 'm sorry , Sam . Sorry 's not gonna bring me back , bunny . I 'm sorry because you made the mistake . - Not me . - You were late . You were early . The target made you , and you got yourself killed . I love you , Sam . I always will . But I have to move on . I have ... to move on . - You okay ? - I 'm fine . What are we gonna do with this ? Artie said ... The picture of the old warden 's office on the wall ... So it was there . Hurry , Artie . Oh , good idea ! What is that ? It sounds like a truck . - No , there 's no truck . - Oh , my God . All right , it 's a truck . Oh , wait , wait ! Come on , come on ! Hang on . Hey , what 's that for , to get rid of the body ? It 's a backup plan if this doesn 't work . What do you mean ? I don 't think I 'm gonna like this . Old girl ! Come and get me ! Don 't do it ! No , please , Artie ! Oh , God , I hope you 're a good shot . Please , Artie ... Please be good at this . Just ... don 't ... move . I promise I 'll be good from now on . - Grab it . - Okay , I 'm trying ! Got it . Artimis Maximus ! That was awesome ! Yeah , it kinda was awesome , wasn 't it ? Let 's get out of here . You 've got to take that off right away . Now . Now . - Hey . Are you hurt ? - No . No , I 'm fine . - What happened ? - It 's a long story . I hope you like crosses . - Oh , my God . - Help me . What happened ? Okay , okay , he 's losing a lot of blood . We gotta get him out of here . It 's all right . He 's chosen me for sacrifice . I 'm ... on ... a new path . How many times do I have to write this , Artie ? All right , Claudia . You know what ... Enough of doing it that way . All right , so ... Now , Claudia ... okay ... Now , focus . Don 't just write it . Believe it . How long you been working on that ? Since I lost my father . Artie , I 'm sorry . When did he die ? Oh , he 's alive . I just hope that finishing this will help us find each other again . So listen , I 'm taking the girls out for a little night on the town , you know , which , in this part of South Dakota means going for ice cream . You wanna come ? I 'm beat . - I bring you something back ? - You know I don 't eat sugar . Right , butter pecan , caramel sauce , chocolate sprinkles . You all right ? I 'm good . You know ... All right . Remember , if you want to talk ... Maybe tomorrow . - I 'll have my people call your people . - You do that .

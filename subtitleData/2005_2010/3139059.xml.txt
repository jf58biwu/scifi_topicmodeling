PEOPLE ARE GAINING ABILITIES , AND NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT . KYLE , IF YOU 'RE INVOLVED IN SOMETHING ... [ CASSIE ] : COLLIER WILL LEAD THE HUMAN RACE TO SALVATION . YOU WILL HELP HIM . WHAT IS THIS PLACE ? CASSIE JUST SAID WE SHOULD COME HERE . YOU ARE ON THE WRONG PATH HERE . AND YOU 'VE ALWAYS BEEN REBELLIOUS , BUT I THINK YOU 'RE AFRAID OF CHANGE , SHAWN , OR IS IT JUST ME ? [ ARMAND ] : YOU DON 'T REALLY KNOW THIS GIRL AT ALL , DO YOU ? [ SHAWN ] : BABY ... GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME . I SHARE AN OFFICE WITH TWO OF THE MOST ANNOYING GUYS ON THE PLANET . I JUST DON 'T UNDERSTAND WHY COLLIER WOULD RISK COMING BACK TO SEATTLE . IT 'S LIKE HE 'S DARING US TO CATCH HIM . THIS IS A MESSAGE OF HOPE FOR A BETTER TOMORROW , AND IT BEGINS HERE , IN PROMISE CITY . [ MEGHAN ] : I WAS GOING TO ASK IF YOU WERE SURE YOU WANTED TO BE A PART OF THIS OPERATION . BELIEVE ME , I WANT COLLIER CAUGHT AS MUCH AS ANYONE . IT 'S NOT COLLIER I WAS THINKING ABOUT . HE 'S MY SON . I 'VE GOT TO BELIEVE I CAN STILL REACH HIM . TOM ? DIANA , WHAT THE HELL 'S GOING ON ? WHERE IS EVERYONE ? YOU 'RE THE FIRST PERSON I 'VE SEEN . I JUST WOKE UP ON THE FLOOR OF THE BREAK ROOM . WHY WERE YOU SLEEPING IN THE BREAK ROOM ? I DON 'T KNOW . WHY WAS I SLEEPING AT MY DESK ? THE LAST THING I REMEMBER WAS GOING ... TO BED AT HOME . THE LAST THING I REMEMBER , I WAS GOING OVER CASE FILES IN MY LIVING ROOM . TOM , SKOURIS ! WHY DID I JUST WAKE UP UNDERNEATH MY OFFICE CHAIR ? PLEASE TELL ME YOU KNOW HOW WE GOT HERE . POSSIBILITY ONE , WE 'RE UNDER ATTACK , SOMEONE WITH A GRUDGE AGAINST NTAC USED A 4400 ABILITY AGAINST US . MAYBE MORE THAN ONE . THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE MEMORY GAPS , BUT IF A 4400 WERE COMING AFTER US , WHY ARE WE STILL ALIVE ? ARE WE THE ONLY SURVIVORS IN THE BUILDING ? MAYBE , OR MAYBE THE ATTACKERS HAVEN 'T GOTTEN DOWN TO OUR LEVEL YET . LET 'S NOT IGNORE POSSIBILITY TWO ... THE WORLD AT LARGE IS UNDER ATTACK . THE BUILDING 'S REACTING TO A SECURITY SITUATION OUT THERE . SO , WHAT , WE 'RE THE ONLY SURVIVORS IN THE WORLD ? COULD WE MAYBE COME UP WITH A POSSIBILITY THAT DOESN 'T INVOLVE AN ATTACK ? IT 'S NOT RESPONDING . WE 'RE LOCKED OUT OF THE BUILDING 'S NETWORK . I CAN 'T EVEN ACCESS THE SYSTEM . MAYBE WE CAN DO IT FROM OPS . TRY TO GET IN THROUGH THE MAINFRAME , ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD . OR MAYBE WE COULD JUST WALK OUT THE FRONT DOOR . DO YOU HEAR THAT ALARM ? THAT MEANS THE BUILDING 'S SEALED , AND IT 'S GOING TO STAY SEALED UNTIL SOMEONE OVERRIDES THE SECURITY PROTOCOLS . WE COULD BE THE ONLY ONES HERE WHO KNOW HOW TO DO THAT . ALL RIGHT . GET YOURSELF READY TO GO . OKAY , I DON 'T CARE IF THIS BUILDING IS CRAWLING WITH EVERY P-POSITIVE IN SEATTLE , WE 'RE GETTING TO OPS . FIRST , WAKE UP P.J. P.J. , WAKE UP , MAN . NO PHONES , NO EMAIL . EVEN THE EMERGENCY RADIO DOESN 'T WORK . INTERNAL SURVEILLANCE IS DOWN , TOO . I CAN 'T FIND A SIDEARM ANYWHERE . MARCO ! GOOD TO SEE WE 'RE NOT ALONE . GOD , TELL ME YOU 'VE GOT SOME ANSWERS . OH , YOU GOT INTO THE NETWORK . GOOD JOB , BRADY . THAT WASN 'T ME . I 'M STILL LOCKED OUT . THE ALARM JUST WENT SILENT . THE PHONES ARE STILL DEAD . BUT IF THE SECURITY SYSTEM IS DOWN , THAT COULD MEAN THE EXITS AREN 'T SEALED . WE COULD GET OUT OF HERE . YEAH , IT 'S WORTH CHECKING OUT . TOM , YOU AND I WILL SCOUT AHEAD . MAKE SURE THERE 'S A SAFE PATH TO THE EXIT , OH , AND , DIANA , MAKE SURE YOU STICK WITH THESE GUYS . WATCH THEIR BACKS WHILE THEY WORK ON ESTABLISHING COMMUNICATIONS . WAIT . ALL RIGHT , LET 'S GO . THERE 'S NO ONE THERE . THERE 'S NO ONE ANYWHERE . WE HAVEN 'T SEEN A SOUL SINCE WE LEFT OPS . - = ÆÆÀÃÐÜ × ÖÄ " × é = - · ­ Òë £ º ¸ öÈËID Ð £ ¶ Ô £ º ¸ öÈËID Ê ± ¼ äÖá £ º ° × " ­ ÓÎÏÀ ? COLLIER , WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO THIS PLACE ? DAD ? KYLE ? WHAT 'S GOING ON HERE ? ANSWER ME ! KYLE , RUN ! HOLD IT ! KYLE , NO ! KYLE , WAIT ! WAIT , KYLE ! OPEN THE DOOR . OPEN THE DOOR , KYLE ! LOOK , WHATEVER YOU 'RE DOING HERE , YOU HAVE TO STOP . YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE COLLIER TO STOP . OPEN THE DOOR ! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ? SHAWN ? WHERE ARE WE ? WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME ? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON ? IT WASN 'T ME . I DIDN 'T DO ANYTHING . THIS LOOKS LIKE NTAC . DID WE GET ARRESTED ? I WAS WORKING LATE IN MY APARTMENT . I DON 'T REMEMBER ANYTHING AFTER THAT . MAYBE THE GOVERNMENT 'S ROUNDING UP 4400s . THEY HAVE SOLDIERS WITH ABILITIES . THEY COULD HAVE MESSED WITH OUR MEMORIES . WHY WOULD THEY PUT YOU AND ME TOGETHER ? HELLO ? HELLO ! HELLO ... KYLE ... I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . COLLIER HAS JUST BUILT A HUGE SETTLEMENT FOR HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF SEATTLE . THAT 'S A HUGE WIN FOR HIM . WHY WOULD HE RISK EVERYTHING AND ATTACK THE BUILDING ? HE DIDN 'T STICK AROUND TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF . WHATEVER HE 'S PLANNING , WE HAVE TO BE READY TO DEFEND OURSELVES . GUYS ... CAN WE LOWER THE BLAST DOORS OVER THE ENTRANCES TO THIS ROOM ? THEY 'RE CONTROLLED BY THE COMPUTER , AND WE STILL CAN 'T ACCESS THE SYSTEM . WE COULD MOVE THE FURNITURE AND BUILD A BARRICADE . GREAT , WE 'LL MAKE A WALL MADE OUT OF DESKS AND CHAIRS . I 'M SURE THAT WILL BE REALLY HELPFUL- - ESPECIALLY IF THEY 'VE GOT SOMEBODY WHO CAN MELT OUR BRAINS FROM AROUND THE CORNER . DO YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA ? WAIT , THERE 'S A WEAPONS LOCKER A FEW FLOORS DOWN . THAT 'S WHERE WE STORE ALL THE ASSAULT RIFLES . MAYBE COLLIER HASN 'T GOTTEN TO IT YET . I MEAN , BELIEVE ME , I DON 'T WANT TO POINT A GUN AT KYLE , BUT IF COLLIER IS LEADING SOME KIND OF ATTACK , WE NEED SOMETHING MORE THAN OFFICE SUPPLIES TO FIGHT BACK WITH . MAIA ? MAIA ! WHAT 'S HAPPENING ? WHY AM I HERE ? WE CHECKED THAT ROOM . IT WAS EMPTY . YOU 'RE OKAY NOW . YOU 'RE WITH ME . YOU 'RE SAFE . MY DAD AND HIS BOSS SEEMED JUST AS SURPRISED AS WE WERE . IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY THOUGHT JORDAN BROUGHT US HERE . DID HE ? JORDAN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS . YEAH , BUT HE DOESN 'T ALWAYS SHARE HIS PLANS , KYLE . ? MY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE YOU TWO HAD . HE DOESN 'T HIDE THINGS FROM ME , AND HE SURE AS HELL WASN 'T PLANNING AN ASSAULT ON NTAC . YOU GUYS , WAIT . WE CAN 'T FIGHT , NOT NOW . LOOK , WE 'VE GOT TO FIND JORDAN . HE 'S TRAPPED IN HERE , TOO . I 'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITHOUT HIM . ALL RIGHT , YOU GUYS DO WHATEVER YOU WANT . I 'M GOING TO FIND MY WAY OUT OF HERE . SHAWN . SHAWN ... WHAT , ISABELLE ? WHAT ? LISTEN , WHATEVER 'S GOING ON HERE , WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING OUT IF WE STICK TOGETHER . NOW , STAY WITH US . WE 'LL FIND JORDAN , AND WE 'LL LEAVE AS A GROUP . ? ? E S OS VEOWER WHAT GOOD IS A WEAPONS LOCKER IF YOU CAN 'T GET INTO IT DURING AN EMERGENCY ? MAYBE WE CAN FIND A CROWBAR OR SOMETHING . TRY TO FORCE THE DOOR . HOLD ON . IF WE CAN PRY THAT FACE-PAD OFF , MAYBE I CAN SHORT-CIRCUIT IT . REALLY ? YOU 'RE GOING TO ... HOTWIRE THE DOOR OPEN ? DON 'T LOOK SO SURPRISED . I WORKED IN A THINK TANK FOR YEARS . YOU 'D BE AMAZED AT THE KINDS OF THINGS I PICKED UP AROUND THE WATER COOLER . TRY THIS . WHERE 'D YOU GET THAT ? MY DESK DRAWER . YOU SAID WE MIGHT HAVE TO DEFEND OURSELVES WITH OFFICE SUPPLIES , SO ... WHAT ? NOTHING . NOTHING , I 'M JUST ... WONDERING HOW YOU DO IT . WE ALL WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF NTAC WITH NO EXPLANATION , AND NOW WE 'RE DOWN IN THE BASEMENT , TRYING TO BRK INTO A WEAPONS LOCKER SO WE CAN FIGHT OFF AN ATTACK BY GOD KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE WITH 4400 ABILITIES . IT SEEMS PRETTY HOPELESS , RIGHT ? BUT YOU , YOU JUST KEEP MOVING FORWARD . IF I STOPPED COLD EVERY TIME A SITUATION LOOKED HOPELESS , I WOULDN 'T HAVE LASTED VERY LONG IN THIS JOB . ALL I DO IS FOCUS ON WHAT 'S IN FRONT OF ME . IN A FEW YEARS , YOU 'LL LOOK BACK , AND YOU 'LL REALIZE THAT YOU SURVIVED BY DOING EXACTLY THE SAME THING . A FEW YEARS ? I 'M FLATTERED YOU THINK I 'LL LAST THAT LONG . HERE , COME ON , GIVE ME A HAND . I 'LL TWIST , AND YOU PULL , ALL RIGHT ? OKAY , GOOD . THERE . ALL RIGHT . THERE WE GO . OKAY ... JORDAN ... AND NONE OF YOU HAS ANY IDEA HOW WE GOT HERE ? BUT EVERYONE 'S ALL RIGHT ? NOBODY 'S HURT ? YEAH . SHAWN ? I 'M FINE . WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE ? ALL THE EXITS ARE SEALED , SO I LOOKED FOR THIS PLACE . NTAC IMPRISONS 4400s HERE , AND THOSE WHO HAVE TAKEN THE SHOT . I WAS OKING FOR ALLIES . WELL , THE ENTIRE WING 'S EMPTY , SO I GUESS YOU 'RE OUT OF LUCK . NO . NO , I 'M NOT OUT OF LUCK . I FOUND YOU THREE . THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH . ENOUGH FOR WHAT ? THEIR OPERATIONS CENTER 'S ON THE SECOND LEVEL . COMMUNICATIONS GEAR , SECURITY CONTROLS . WE GET THERE , WE CAN CONTACT PROMISE CITY , SEND FOR HELP . THAT 'S WHERE MY DAD 'S OFFICE IS . THEY 'RE ALL GOING TO BE THERE . LIKELY , BUT THERE 'S NO OTHER WAY . WE NEED CONTROL OF THAT ROOM . NOW YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT OVERPOWERING A BUNCH OF GOVERNMENT AGENTS , JORDAN . WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO , TAKE HOSTAGES ? SHAWN , THEY BROUGHT US HERE AGAINST OUR WILL . THEY 'RE THE AGGRESSORS . I 'LL WALK OUT OF HERE PEACEFULLY IF I CAN , BUT I WILL WALK OUT OF HERE , AND ANY OF YOU NOT WANTING TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN ONE OF THESE CELLS SHOULD JOIN ME . [ SCREAMS ] ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ? YEAH , YEAH . OW . YEAH . YEAH , IT 'S FINE . IT 'S FINE . PREPARE TO BE IMPRESSED . GUESS THE SHOCK WAS WORTH IT . I 'M IMPRESSED . THERE 'S NOTHING HERE . IT 'S EMPTY ! MEGHAN ! WHAT HAPPENED ? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ? YEAH , I 'M FINE . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED . I 'LL TRY AND GET THE LOCK OPEN AGAIN . OKAY . MEGHAN ! MEGHAN ! ARE YOU THERE ? MEGHAN ! OH , MY GOD , MEGHAN . MEGHAN ! LOOK AT ME . MEG ... MEGHAN ! MEGHAN ... I DON 'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED . IT 'S LIKE THAT DOOR CLOSED BY ITSELF . WE WERE ONLY APART FOR A FEW SECONDS . IT WAS AN ACCIDENT , TOM . MAYBE . BUT WE WOULDN 'T BE STUCK IN HERE IF IT WASN 'T FOR COLLIER . MEGHAN 'S DEATH IS ON HIM . WE CAN ADD IT TO THE LIST OF THOUSANDS HE 'S RESPONSIBLE FOR . THIS DOESN 'T MAKE ANY SENSE . SHE SHOULDN 'T BE DEAD . WE HAVE TO GET THE COMPUTERS BACK ONLINE . LET 'S JUST FOCUS ON THAT . WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR ? ANYTHING WE CAN USE TO DEFEND OURSELVES . KYLE ... YEAH . KYLE , THIS IS CRAZY . ARE WE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO USE THESE ON SOMEONE ? I HOPE NOT . THIS WAS ALL I COULD FIND . A BROOM HANDLE ? WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS ? USE IT , OR DON 'T , BUT I 'M NOT INCLINED TO GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT . SEE , WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WE NEED TO FIGHT ? JORDAN , DIDN 'T YOU SAY THAT WHEN YOU RAN INTO MY UNCLE THAT HE THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE BEHIND THIS ? YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE . DOES THAT NOT BEG THE QUESTION , WHAT IF IT WAS NEITHER OF US ? WHAT IF SOMETHING ELSE IS CAUSING THIS ? FIRST , WE CONTROL THAT ROOM , THEN WE ASK QUESTIONS . NO , LET 'S ASK THEM NOW . WHAT YOU SEEM TO BE FORGETTING IS ONE OF THOSE NTAC AGENTS THAT YOU ARE SO INTENT ON BATTLING IS MY UNCLE . KYLE 'S FATHER . THERE 'S GOT TO BE SOME WAY THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH HIM . I 'LL GO . YOU THREE CAN WAIT HERE FOR ME . WHAT ? IT 'S JUST THE FUTURE GAVE YOU THE RIGHT ABILITY . YOU 'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE PEACEFUL SOLUTION , FOR HEALING . I ADMIRE THAT , EVEN IF IT MEANS YOU CAN 'T BE PART OF THE MOVEMENT . WHAT 'S GOING ON ? COME ON , WE NEED TO GO . GET DOWN ! KYLE ! SHAWN ... SHAWN ... SHAWN . SHAWN ? [ SOBBING ] : SHAWN ... YOU KNOW , IT DOESN 'T HAVE TO BE SO WEIRD AND QUIET IN HERE . YOU GUYS CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER . WHAT ? IT 'S NOT WEIRD AND QUIET . YOUR MOM AND I TALK TO EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME . I GUESS , BUT YOU USED TO COME OVER ALMOST EVERY NIGHT . WE 'D PLAY GAMES . IT WAS FUN , AND YOU DON 'T COME OVER ANYMORE . IT 'S LIKE WE 'RE SUPPOSED TO PRETEND NOTHING EVER HAPPENED . IT ... IT 'S COMPLICATED , SWEETIE , BUT MARCO AND I , WE ARE FRIENDS . AREN 'T FRIENDS SUPPOSED TO SEE EACH OTHER SOMETIMES ? EVERYBODY , GET OUT HERE ! THEY 'RE COMING ! YOU KEEP THE DOOR LOCKED AND STAY DOWN , NO MATTER WHAT YOU HEAR . EVERYONE , STAY BACK ! JUST STAY BACK ! COLLIER ! WHATEVER YOU 'RE HERE TO DO , WHATEVER YOU WANT , IT 'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN . DAD , WE 'RE NOT DOING THIS . PLEASE LET ME IN . WE DON 'T WANT TO FIGHT . MEGHAN DOYLE IS DEAD , KYLE . DO YOU UNDERSTAND ? SHE 'S DEAD . HOW COULD YOU DO THIS ? I TOLD YOU , IT 'S NOT US , ALL RIGHT ? WE JUST WOKE UP HERE . WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED . IT 'S THE TRUTH . YOU 'RE LYING- - OH , GOD . YOU 'RE HURT ? WHAT HAPPENED ? A WINDOW BLEW OUT . I GOT CUT . AND SHAWN ... SHAWN ? SHAWN ! OH , NO ... THIS ISN 'T RIGHT . THIS ISN 'T HOW IT 'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN . HE 'S DEAD . BECAUSE OF YOU ! TWO PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF YOU ! I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS ! THE HELL YOU DIDN 'T ! STOP ! HE 'S TELLING THE TRUTH ! HE DIDN 'T BRING YOU HERE . I DID . I MADE THIS HAPPEN . I TOOK THE SHOT . WE 'RE ALL HERE BECAUSE OF MY ABILITY . I TOOK THE SHOT ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO . ONCE PROMICIN GOT OUT THERE , I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO CHANGE EVERYTHING FOREVER . SCIENCE , POLITICS , RELIGION . I JUST WANTED TO BE PART OF IT . I HAD TO BE PART OF IT . THEN ONE NIGHT , MY FIANCEE AND MY MOTHER HAD THIS HUGE FIGHT ABOUT THE GUEST LIST AT OUR WEDDING . I WENT TO BED WISHING THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO TO SMOOTH THINGS OVER BETWEEN THEM . WHEN I WOKE UP , I WAS SOMEPLACE ELSE . ME , MY MOM , SARA . WE DIDN 'T KNOW HOW WE GOT THERE , BUT WE WERE TRAPPED IN THIS HUGE TRAFFIC JAM ON THE SPOKANE STREET BRIDGE . IT WAS AN HOUR AWAY FROM WHEN WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GET MARRIED . WE HAD TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET ACROSS TOWN , AND WHEN I SAY " WORK , " I MEAN , WORK . THERE WERE EARTHQUAKES , FLOODS , A FIRE . IT WAS CRAZY . BUT WE SURVIVED TOGETHER , AND WE GOT TO THE CHURCH JUST IN TIME . I KISSED SARA AT THE END OF THE CEREMONY , AND THEN WE ALL WOKE UP AT HOME . THE GAME WAS OVER . THE GAME ? YEAH . I FIGURED OUT HOW IT WORKS SINCE THEN MY ABILITY . IT 'S LIKE A GAME . P.J. , STOP USING THE WORD " GAME . " THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE DEAD . I 'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT . NO ONE 'S EVER DIED BEFORE . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE REAL WORLD . WHY NTAC ? WHY DID YOU PICK THIS PLACE ? I DIDN 'T PICK IT . YOU DID . WE ALL DID . BUT-BUT I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER ANYTHING ELSE . WE DETERMINE WHERE WE GO , ALL OF OUR MINDS , TOGETHER . IT 'S A SUBCONSCIOUS THING . NTAC MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO EACH OF US , BUT IT MATTERS TO EVERYONE ? THAT 'S HOW WE GOT HERE ? EXACTLY , AND THERE 'S ALWAYS AN OBSTACLE- - SOMETHING ALL THE PLAYERS HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO OVERCOME . I KNOW THIS SOUNDS WEIRD , BUT IN THIS CASE , I THINK THE OBSTACLE IS THE BUILDING ITSELF . YOU 'RE SAYING NTAC IS TRYING TO KILL US ? THAT MAKES SENSE . THE BUILDING ELECTROCUTED MEGHAN . THE BUILDING CAUSED THE WIND BURST THAT SHATTERED THAT WINDOW AND KILLED SHAWN FARRELL . SO , WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO ? JUST SIT HERE AND WAIT FOR IT TO PICK US ALL OFF ? NO . WE 'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK TOGETHER . THAT 'S THE WHOLE POINT . I SIT IN MY OFFICE EVERY DAY , AND I READ ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE , ABOUT HOW IT 'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE EVERYTHING BLOWS UP . A WAR BETWEEN POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES . THAT 'S WHY I BROUGHT PEOPLE FROM BOTH SIDES HERE . I-I WANTED TO HELP . I WANTED TO BRING THE TWO CAMPS TOGETHER . SO WE GET TO WATCH EACH OTHER DIE ONE BY ONE ? THAT 'S A HELL OF A VALUABLE LESSON . YOU HAVEN 'T JUST PUT OUR LIVES AT STAKE . IF I DIE , IF KYLE DIES HERE , THAT COULD MEAN THE END OF THE MOVEMENT . YOU 'VE JEOPARDIZED EVERYTHING WE 'VE WORKED FOR . WELL , LET 'S NOT MAKE IT EASY FOR THIS PLACE TO HURT US . WE SHOULD MOVE ALL THE COMPUTERS OUT OF HERE . ANYTHING ELECTRONIC- - NO , THERE MIGHT BE A WAY OUT OF THIS . THE LAST COUPLE TIMES I PLAYED , I FIGURED OUT THAT THERE 'S ALWAYS A BACK DOOR . IF I FIND IT , I CAN WALK THROUGH IT , AND IF I DO , THE GAME ENDS . WE ALL WAKE UP . HOPEFULLY , SHAWN AND MEGHAN DO , TOO . WHERE IS IT ? IT 'S USUALLY AT THE FAR EDGE OF THE PLAYING FIELD . WHEREVER I WOKE UP IN THE GAME , IT 'S AS FAR AWAY FROM THERE AS POSSIBLE . WAIT , WAIT , YOU CAME TO IN THE THEORY ROOM , RIGHT ? OKAY , MARCO , FIND SOME MAPS OF THE BUILDING . FIGURE OUT WHERE THIS BACK DOOR SHOULD BE . EVERYONE , GET TO WORK , AND BE CAREFUL . [ KYLE ] : DO YOU THINK SHAWN 'S REALLY GONE ? I DON 'T KNOW . LET 'S HOPE NOT . LOOK , I KNOW YOU THINK TAKING THE SHOT WAS WRONG . OW ! BUT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING . AH ... I MEAN , I KNEW THAT FOLLOWING COLLIER MEANT I HAD TO GET USED TO PEOPLE DYING , MAYBE EVEN PEOPLE I KNEW . I KEPT SAYING , YOU KNOW , THESE DEATHS WEREN 'T MEANINGLESS . THEY WERE SACRIFICES . I STILL BELIEVE THAT . I DO . BUT SEEING SHAWN LYING THERE- - YOU MIGHT WANT TO REMEMBER THAT FEELING THE NEXT TIME COLLIER HANDS DOWN ORDERS . OW ! I DON 'T WANT TO LECTURE YOU , BUT YOU DON 'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WORRY ABOUT YOU THE WAY I DO . EVERY TIME I HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT COLLIER ON THE NEWS , EVERY TIME I PICK UP THE PAPER IN THE MORNING , I 'M AFRAID THAT I 'M GOING TO LEARN THAT YOU 'RE IN JAIL , OR THAT YOU 'RE DEAD . I DON 'T SEE HOW IT COULD END ANY OTHER WAY FOR YOU . WE COULD WIN , RIGHT ? WE COULD SAVE THE WORLD . WELL , I WANT A SON , NOT A MARTYR FOR COLLIER 'S CAUSE . DAD , THAT 'S ENOUGH GAUZE . I 'M SORRY . I GUESS I NEVER STOP BEING A DAD . I THINK MARCO 'S GOT SOMETHING . THAT 'S IT . THE DEAD END OF THIS HALLWAY ON SUB-LEVEL 11 . THAT 'S THE FARTHEST POINT IN THE BUILDING FROM OUR OFFICE . IF P.J. ' S BACK DOOR IS ANYWHERE , THAT 'S THE SPOT . ALL RIGHT , I 'LL GO . NOT ALONE , YOU WON 'T . THIS WHOLE BUILDING IS ONE BIG TRAP . WE 'RE NOT SENDING YOU OUT THERE ON YOUR OWN . HE WON 'T BE ALONE . AS FAR AS I KNOW , I 'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN END THIS . I HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR . ALL RIGHT , GET YOURSELF READY . WE 'RE LEAVING IN TWO MINUTES . I 'M GOING WITH YOU . THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN EXERCISE IN COOPERATION . I THINK IT 'S FITTING WE DIVIDE THE RISK . I 'M THINKING WE SHOULD TAKE THE STAIRS . YEAH . YOU CARED ABOUT SHAWN , DIDN 'T YOU ? SHAWN WAS JUST A LITTLE KID WHEN HIS FATHER LEFT MY SISTER . I TRIED TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN HIM , DO WHAT I COULD TO HELP RAISE HIM . WELL , YOU DID A FINE JOB . HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY ... HE IS ... AN EXTRAORDINARY YOUNG MAN . HE AND I HAVE GROWN APART . IT 'S DIFFICULT , LOSING SOMEONE YOU 'VE ... YOU 'VE INVESTED SO MUCH TIME IN . WELL , YOU MADE THAT BED FOR YOURSELF . SHAWN BROKE OFF FROM YOU BECAUSE HE DIDN 'T AGREE WITH WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN , AND YOU WERE TOO RIGID TO CHANGE . ISN 'T THAT WHY KYLE PULLED AWAY FROM YOU ? HEY , DON 'T COMPARE THE TWO SITUATIONS . FOR ONE THING , IF IT WASN 'T FOR YOU , WE WOULDN 'T EVEN BE STANDING HERE WONDERING WHETHER SHAWN WAS ALIVE OR DEAD . YOU PUT THE SHOTS OUT THERE , WHICH IS WHY HE COULD TAKE ONE , AND THAT 'S WHY TWO PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT MIGHT BE DEAD . THE SPREAD OF PROMICIN IS NOT TO BLAME . THE FEAR OF IT IS . YOUR GOVERNMENT PREVENTS PEOPLE WHO 'VE TAKEN THE SHOT EATR R ABILITIES . YOU 'VE CRIMINALIZED THE GIFTED . SO , WHAT ? WE SHOULD ALL JUST STEP ASIDE AND LET YOU RUN THE WORLD ? HEY ! CAN YOU TWO EVER STOP ARGUING ? YOU ARE LITERALLY GOING TO GET US ALL KILLED ! IF YOU CAN 'T CALM DOWN , YOU BOTH MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK TO OPS RIGHT NOW . I 'LL FIND THE WAY OUT MYSELF . THESE ARE THE STAIRS . LET 'S GO . UM ... WOULD YOU MIND GOING FIRST ? I GOT YOUR BACK . IF THIS BACK DOOR THING DOESN 'T WORK OUT , WE 'RE GOING TO NEED ANOTHER PLAN . WE ALREADY KNOW WE CAN 'T GET TO THE GENERATORS , SO ... MAIA , WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? I 'M JUST HELPING KYLE . WE DON 'T KNOW THIS PLACE AS WELL AS YOU GUYS , BUT WE MIGHT AS WELL PITCH IN . I MEAN , WHO KNOWS ? MAYBE WE 'LL COME UP WITH SOMETHING . OKAY , THAT 'S GREAT . MAIA , WILL YOU GO STAND WITH MARCO ? MOM , WE 'RE JUST TRYING TO- - GO NOW . HEY ... YOU KNOW , I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE , TOO , JUST THE SAME WAY YOU DO . I KNOW YOU HATE ME . TELL YOU THE TRUTH , I DON 'T BLAME YOU , BUT YOU DO NEED TO WORK WITH ME . THAT 'S THE GAME . YOU THREATENED MY DAUGHTER 'S LIFE . I KNOW . YOU SHOT ME FOR IT , REMEMBER ? YEAH , SIX TIMES , MORE IF I COULD HAVE RELOADED . I REALLY DON 'T CARE WHAT THIS LITTLE EXERCISE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT . YOU JUST STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM MAIA . MAIA , COME OVER HERE . WELL , THAT 'S IT . IF WE CAN GET THROUGH THAT DOOR , THAT SHOULD BE THE WAY OUT . LET ME TRY . THAT 'S ME . MY BEDROOM . LOOKS LIKE WE FOUND OUR BACK DOOR . I KNOW I 'M GOING TO JAIL WHEN WE ALL WAKE UP . JUST ... MAKE SURE EVERYONE KNOWS I 'M SORRY . P.J. ! HE 'S DEAD . IT 'S GONE . ? THAT WON 'T WORK . P.J. SAID HE 'S THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN END THIS EARLY . YEAH , WELL , I 'M NOT GIVING UP . NEITHER AM I. THE BACK DOOR WAS JUST THAT , A WAY OUT , ONE OPTION . THERE IS ANOTHER . WE PLAY OUT THE GAME . TRY TO SURVIVE . WIN . WIN ? P.J. SAID THERE WAS A GOAL TO EVERY GAME , AN END POINT . YEAH , BUT WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS . NOT YET , BUT I DOUBT WE 'LL FIND IT DOWN HERE . WE HEAD BACK UP TO THE OPERATIONS ROOM , WE STICK TOGETHER , FIGURE OUT A WAY TO LIVE . WAIT A SECOND . IS IT ME OR IS IT GETTING HOTTER IN HERE ? AH ! THAT AIR 'S GOT TO BE WELL OVER A HUNDRED DEGREES . SO THIS PLACE IS GOING TO COOK US ALL ? ? PERSONALLY , I 'D RATHER BE ELECTROCUTED THAN FRICASSEED . LOOK , NOBODY 'S GETTING COOKED . THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS ARE JUST A FEW FLOORS DOWN . WE CAN CHANGE THE TEMPERATURE MANUALLY . IT WON 'T WORK . THE TEMPERATURE CONTROL RUNS THROUGH THE MAIN COMPUTER NETWORK , AND WE STILL CAN 'T ACCESS THE SYSTEM . WE NEED TO KILL THE BUILDING . THIS PLACE RUNS ON POWER . WE TAKE THAT AWAY , IT CAN 'T HURT US ANYMORE . WE SHUT THE BUILDING DOWN , WE WIN . YOU DON 'T THINK WE 'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ? THE EMERGENCY GENERATORS ARE SEALED OFF . WELL ... IT 'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT BAD OF AN IDEA . LOOK , WE CAN 'T SHUT THE GENERATORS DOWN BECAUSE WE CAN 'T GET TO THEM , BUT IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO CREATE AN ELECTRICAL SURGE BIG ENOUGH TO OVERLOAD THE EMERGENCY SYSTEMS- - THERE 'D BE A POWER OUTAGE . THIS PLACE WOULD GO BLACK . THERE 'S TWO MAJOR POWER RELAYS THAT RUN THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE BUILDING- - OUR EVERYDAY SYSTEM AND THE EMERGENCY LINE . IF WE CAN FIND A PLACE WHERE THE TWO RELAYS RUN CLOSE TO EACH OTHER ... CONNECT THE TWO LINES AND " ZAP " ! SHORT THE BUILDING OUT . THERE . WE KEEP ALL THE COMPUTER SERVERS IN THAT ROOM . EVERY POWER CONDUIT IN THE BUILDING RUNS THROUGH THERE . OKAY . IF P.J. HASN 'T GOTTEN US OUT OF HERE IN TWO MINUTES , MARCO , YOU AND I ARE HEADING TO THAT ROOM . ISABELLE ... YOU FIND THE LONGEST POWER CORD YOU CAN AND STRIP THE INSULATION OFF OF IT . YOU 'RE COMING WITH US . IT 'S YOUR IDEA . YOU SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE IT THROUGH . WHAT IS THAT ? UH , THE BUILDING . I DON 'T THINK IT LIKES OUR PLAN . WHAT 'S HAPPENING ? IT 'S NOT BLOWING AIR INTO THE ROOM ANYMORE . IT 'S SUCKING IT OUT . OKAY , GUYS , WE 'RE NOT WAITING TWO MINUTES . WE 'RE ALL GOING NOW . THE BLAST DOORS ARE DOWN . HELLO ! STAY THERE . HELLO ! DAD ! KYLE , WHAT 'S HAPPENING ? THE BUILDING SHUT US OFF ! IT 'S SUCKING ALL THE AIR OUT OF THE ROOM ! TOM , I DON 'T THINK WE 'VE GOT MUCH TIME ! YOU HAVE TO TRY AND SHORT-CIRCUIT THE BUILDING 'S POWER SUPPLY ! THIS WAS ALL I COULD FIND . WE NEED TO RUN THAT CORD BETWEEN THESE TWO POWER RELAYS . IF MARCO 'S RIGHT , THAT 'LL SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN . WELL , THIS IS NOT NEARLY LONG ENOUGH . THEN FIND MORE ! THESE POWER LINES ARE ALL ... THEY 'RE ALL SEALED INTO THE WALL . IF WE COULD RIP THESE OUT OF THE CEILING . NO , THEY 'RE DYING IN THAT ROOM . WE DON 'T HAVE TIME . THERE IS ONE WAY TO COMPLETE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE RELAYS . US . WE COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT OURSELVES . YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT RUNNING THOUSANDS OF VOLTS OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH OUR BODIES . WE 'LL DIE . WE WILL , BUT IF YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE RIGHT ... WE 'LL END THIS THING . SO HOW ABOUT IT ? YOU DON 'T STRIKE ME AS A MAN AFRAID OF A SACRIFICE . I KEEP TELLING MYSELF IT 'S JUST A GAME , BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ? I STILL DON 'T FEEL LIKE DYING . IT 'S NOT AN EXPERIENCE I 'M LOOKING TO REVISIT . WELL , I GUESS IT 'S LIKE YOU 'RE ALWAYS SAYING- - JUST HAVE TO HAVE FAITH . ON THREE ? ON THREE . [ TOGETHER ] : ONE ... TWO ... THREE ! MAIA ! MOM ! OH , SWEETHEART , YOU OKAY ? OH ... YOU 'RE OKAY . YOU 'RE NOT HURT . I 'M FINE . IS JORDAN HERE ? HAVE YOU SEEN HIM ? CAN I TALK TO TOM BALDWIN , PLEASE ? TOM . HI . WE , UH ... WE PICKED UP P.J. AFTER HE WOKE UP , HE TRIED TO MAKE A RUN FOR PROMISE CITY , AND , UH , WE ... I-I 'M FINE , REALLY . IT 'S OKAY . I 'M SORRY . IT 'S JUST ... I WATCHED YOU DIE LAST NIGHT . YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW GOOD IT IS TO SEE YOU RIGHT NOW . I 'M SORRY THAT THINGS GOT SO OUT OF HAND , AND I KNOW I 'M GOING TO JAIL FOR TAKING THE SHOT , SO IT 'S PROBABLY THE WRONG TIME TO SAY THIS , BUT IF EVERYTHING YOU TOLD ME IS TRUE , MAYBE IT 'LL BE WORTH IT , PLAYING THE GAME . HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT ? IT WAS SCARY , BUT MY ABILITY WORKED . JORDAN COLLIER AND TOM BALDWIN ACTUALLY COOPERATED . THEY SACRIFICED THEMSELVES TO SAVE THE OTHER PLAYERS . THAT HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING , RIGHT ? LET 'S HOPE SO . I 'D HATE TO THINK YOU GAVE UP YOUR FREEDOM FOR NOTHING . SOMEONE WILL BE HERE SHORTLY TO TAKE YOU DOWNSTAIRS . ARE YOU OKAY ? YEAH . IT 'S GOING TO BE STRANGE NOT HAVING P.J. IN THE OFFICE ANYMORE . YEAH , I KNOW IT 'S NOT P.C. , BUT I KIND OF ADMIRE WHAT HE DID . YOU KNOW , I KNOW JORDAN COLLIER A HELL OF A LOT BETTER THAN I DID A DAY AGO , AND HE KNOWS US . THAT 'S GOT TO BE A GOOD THING . YEAH , WELL ... WE 'LL SEE ABOUT THAT . MARCO , I ... WAS MAIA RIGHT ? HAVE THINGS GOTTEN WEIRD BETWEEN US ? UH ... KIND OF HARD TO AVOID , RIGHT ? YOU BROKE UP WITH ME , AND I STILL HAVE TO SEE YOU EVERY DAY . WELL , IF YOU 'RE UP FOR IT , I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO BE FRIENDS , AND I PROMISED MAIA THAT I WOULD COOK A MEATLOAF TOMORROW NIGHT , AND ... MAYBE YOU COULD COME BY . I KNOW THAT SHE WOULD REALLY LIKE THAT . SO WOULD I. THE INFAMOUS SKOURIS MEATLOAF . IT 'S GOTTEN BETTER , I PROMISE . WILL I SEE YOU THEN ? OKAY . BALDWIN . YOUR SON 'S FINE . WE ALL ARE . COLLIER ? I WANTED YOU TO KNOW . WELL , I APPRECIATE THAT . I 'VE BEEN LEAVING HIM MESSAGES ALL MORNING . I TALKED TO SHAWN A WHILE AGO . HE 'S ... HE 'S DOING ALL RIGHT , TOO . I DON 'T WANT ANY MISUNDERSTANDING . NOTHING 'S CHANGED BETWEEN US . I 'M STILL GOING TO GIVE PROMICIN TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE . AND I WILL STILL BUILD PROMISE CITY . AND YOU 'RE GOING TO WIND UP IN HANDCUFFS , JORDAN , AND I 'M GOING TO BE THE ONE PUTTING THEM ON YOU . YOU CALLED ME JORDAN JUST THEN . YEAH ... i ? P.J. ACCOMPLISHED THAT MUCH , ANYWAY . SO ... TOM ... WOULD YOU LIKE TO HANG UP , OR SHALL I ?

A moral core , huh ? You don 't see a lot of that . - No , you don 't . Guess it 's ' cause they can get you so killed . Frak me , I 'm sorry , I didn 't ... - It 's okay . Let 's keep looking . Jump completed . Hang on . The jump drained almost all our reserve power . Frak ! Dradis is empty . If the fleet 's here , we 're out of range . I 'll send a pulse . If they 're in this system , they 'll come running , maybe 10 hours . Hey , Finn . Finn ! Azerin ! Wake up , we jumped . We 're almost home . Azurin ? What ? Gods !

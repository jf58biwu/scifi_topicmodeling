 The cultural festival and subsequent chaos was finally over with . And now that we can hear the approaching footsteps of winter and mountain winds howling December draws near . In this old shack dating back to the school 's founding the clubhouse within its flimsy walls we spent one ... 0 ) \ 3aH55 \ 3cH9A8D83 } SOS Brigade ... unusually cold day . 387 ) } Someday in the Rain The SOS Brigade keeps getting caught up in various incidents . Or to be more precise I am . we couldn 't possibly run into situations like that every single day . Besides if these bombshells of not-so-ordinary life went off every day my body would break . My spirit would fare far worse . 261 ) } CHIEF In any case it sure is nice and quiet when Haruhi isn 't around . But I guess it 's ... huh ? Now that I think about it it 's already been half a year since I met everyone . We 've sure been through a lot . Situations where Haruhi was the instigator and a few where she wasn 't . Well ... Most of them started when we were kicking back and relaxing in the clubroom like so only to be interrupted by her barging in ... everyone ! Great news ! Again ? Her so-called great news always ends up being especially for Asahina-san and me anything but . What is it this time ? I 've made arrangements for there to be heating in the clubroom . Right away ! The electronics store that was a sponsor for the movie offered to provide heating . He forgot that he 'd put one of last year 's unsold units into storage so he called and asked if we would take a heater he was planning to throw out anyway . I doubt an electronics store would be bored and considerate enough to bother calling Haruhi about such a wonderful offer which means she probably wormed this out of the guy . Kyon you go to the store and pick it up . Me ? Now ? Yes . You . Now . Look here . You want me to go back down the hill I already have to walk up and down every day and take the train two whole stops to the electronics store then come all the way back while carrying that thing ? That 's right . If you don 't hurry the guy might change his mind ! Just get going already ! It 's not like you have anything better to do . I get the feeling that being in this room automatically marks you as a person with nothing better to do . And you have something better to do ? I have something I have to take care of . Koizumi-kun is the vice chief and you 're just a mere brigade member . Making lower peons work their butts off is a practice found in any organization ! the SOS Brigade is adhering to that rule . Oh well . At least Haruhi 's made a reasonable request this time . fine . Do be careful . It just so happened that I 'd been wanting heating in the clubroom . I 'll go with you . Mikuru-chan . If the alternative means Asahina-san or Nagato doing it ... You stay here . Kyon 's duty to handle these odd errands . ... I might as well go . Wait ! It 's cold today . Thanks . Hurry up ! Get going ! Now . The obstacle has been dealt with . Mikuru-chan . so how about you strike a pose . Wh-What kind of pictures ! ? Isn 't that obvious ? Pictures for the cover jacket ... The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina . Do you really mean to make a DVD for it ? Didn 't you give up on that idea ? That 's only ' cause Kyon was being annoying about it . Nobody 's around to oppose me now . the first time I climbed this hill on my way to school ... I 've totally gotten used to it . Used to the hiking workout to and from school ... And used to the SOS Brigade . I wonder what Haruhi is doing right now in the clubroom without me around . I hope she didn 't say she was bored or something and started using Asahina-san as her plaything . Koizumi-kun . You 're responsible for holding up the mirror . Understood . Mikuru-chan . Don 't just stand there . Strike a pose ! C 'mon ! C 'mon ! O-Okay ! Your smile needs to be more provocative ! Look more sultry ! That 's not going to satisfy the male users ! Time for a costume change ! This one 's next ! Come on already ! Let go ! No ! I 'll do it myself ! Who cares ! It 's faster if I help ! Y-You even took off my bra ... It 's gonna come off in the end anyway ! Mikuru-chan did you get even bigger ? You 're looking even more dynamite ! Wh-Wh-Wh-Where are you touching me ! ? { \ 3cH000000 } - Stop struggling ! { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } No ! My tea 's gotten cold . It 's cold ... And this is embarrassing ... Mikuru-chan . You should be more confident in yourself . I picked you as the number one mascot character in this school ! Koizumi-kun ? It is exactly as you say . then ! Put this on ! Again ... ? No ! I-I-I can do it myself ! Geez . We have to finish everything today ! Hurry up ! next ! This one ! Um ... This nurse outfit and that costume weren 't used in the movie ... Are these pictures really for the cover jacket ? Sure ! But a light bulb just went off in my head ! right ? Koizumi-kun ? A quite splendid idea . No ! Wait ! If we 're going to release a DVD ... right ? Koizumi-kun ? An extraordinarily excellent idea . The train will be arriving momentarily . Turn around . It would seem that a shower is imminent . Put this on ! Wasn 't it funny ? Really ? I was totally expecting it ! Come on ! Take it off ! Take it off ! It 's not over yet ? { \ 3cH000000 } - Don 't move ! You don 't need to take that off ! so it has to go ! Boooon ! These looping feelings ! No ! { \ 3cH000000 } - So fun ! This is the heater I promised . Can you carry it back ? somehow . Are those cute little girls doing well ? One of them is doing so well she causes everyone trouble . Did the commercial help business at all ? To be honest I haven 't seen any change . yeah . A commercial in the middle of a movie shown at a school cultural festival has too small of an audience . I 'm amazed you actually sponsored the thing . By the way ... The cheerful girl mentioned this on the phone ... Are you really making a sequel to the movie ? If she says so then it must be true . too . Consider this heater an advance on the next movie . So that 's the trick she used . then . Thank you very much . Take care . The candy is so red . A-I-U-E-O . too . Persimmon tree . Chestnut tree . Ka-Ki-Ku-Ke-Ko . Woodpecker steadily drilling at a withered zelkova . Splash vinegar as an offering . Sa-Shi-Su-Se-So . That fish was caught in the shallows . Stand up and blow your horn . Ta-Chi-Tsu-Te-To . You do the next one ! Stood up . Ta-ta . Ta-ta . Took off . The slug is slimy . Na-Ni-Nu-Ne-No . The culprit is you ! I see . Hmm ... Very well . what is going to happen ? Next question ! Amazing . Her presence on the stage is enough to alter the atmosphere . she seems completely different from before . Like a different person from who she was a moment ago ! What a frightening child ! Noodle soup combo ! Fried rice combo ! Heavenly mountain combo ! Youth Ace ! Middle-aged Ace ! Retired Ace ! Held-back Ace ! Next year 's Ace ! Consolation Ace ! Just can 't stand ' im Ace ! Why aren 't you trying your hardest ! ? Bring it on ! I could see your actions coming from a mile away ! Looks like a child on the outside ! Unsure about the inside ! A strong defender of the city ! His name is Detective ... Stand back ! Back ! Back ! Can you not see the crest I wear ! ? For I am the Queen of France ! Don 't hit anything strange ! Still too naive ! there ! We 're the Ice Candies ! Yuki-chan ! Lookin ' as sexy as ever ! sick freak ? I 'll call the cops on you . A low blow right off the bat ? I feel like I was just accused of being a molester on a packed train ! huh . winter ! Speaking of winter ... The baseball off-season . Yuki-chan ! The World Baseball Classic is right around the corner ! I 'm interested in the underdog players this year . And we 're completely in the dark ! What a thrill ! you know ... yeah ? I 'm hungry for some hot pot . Yes . Winter is all about the hot pot ! What do you put in your hot pot ? Let 's see ... tofu ... what about you ? Brown bear . Whoa ! You 're a hunter ! ? Those old tribal guys would run away crying from a bear ! so I never actually eat any . Then you could just not put any in the hot pot in the first place . Then I 'll be the bear from now on . What ? You will ? And you be the pot . This is it ! The historical comedy ... Kyon . What are you doing here ? Can 't you tell ? Transporting goods . huh . Probably following Suzumiya 's orders again . It would appear that half a year was long enough for my classmates to recognize my position . Are you going back to school now ? You really are working hard . For real . Later ! See you tomorrow ! Bah . It 's starting to drizzle . The weather forecast said there was a ten percent chance of rain . Worthless weatherman ... Let 's pray it doesn 't start pouring . Oh ? Looks like rain . I wonder if Kyon-kun 's okay . I have never longed to be in that room as badly as I do right now . I want to get myself some of Asahina-san 's tea as soon as possible and warm my spirit and body . Hey-hey ! Is Mikuru here ? Er ... what ? It 's just Nagato-chi ? I need her to trade off with me on cleaning tomorrows ... So I came to ask her ... Where 's Mikuru ? So she 's thataway . Thankie ! Oh boy ... ooh ! Kyon-kun ? Tsuruya-san . Now I get it ... Get what ? Nothings ! Good work ! You 're soaked . Thanks . See ya ! Just give the handkerchief to Mikuru when you return this . As always an unpredictable person . sociable upperclassman . Huh ? Nagato . It 's just you ? Where 's everyone else ? Yes ! That 's where you fall on your butt ! You 've got it down ! Ow ! Your clumsiness will make them all swoon ! You sure that wasn 't on purpose ? Koizumi-kun . Hold this for a sec . You do it like this . Where and what are those three doing right now ? I 'm a bit worried but lugging that thing up the hill pretty much wore me out . And the fact that I have to go back down after school doesn 't help . C 'mon ! C 'mon ! C 'mon ! C 'mon ! C 'mon ! My hands are frozen . I 'm bushed . It 's just you ? What ? Got a problem with that ? Not really ... did you ? I wouldn 't do something so childish ! Where are the other three ? They already went home . It didn 't look like you were waking up anytime soon . And so you opted to stay here instead ? I couldn 't help it ! You were still asleep . I can 't leave without locking the door . And it 's raining ! Give it back . Huh ? My cardigan . One of them definitely belongs to Haruhi . But who does this other one belong to ? wait . Does this mean Asahina-san was changing right next to me while I was asleep ? Damn it . Why did I fall asleep ? I should have faked it ! Come on . Everyone left school a while ago . We should get going . But this sucks ... I don 't have an umbrella . One should be enough . Hold it more towards me . I 'm getting wet . It 's already well on your side . This isn 't your umbrella . It says " for faculty use " on here . It 's school property . There 's nothing wrong with a student using it . Or what ? If you want to go home wet I won 't share it with you ! Honestly ... I picked up the heater for you and not a word of appreciation ... huh ? Hold up !

 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles - You 've got a nuclear sub ? - Seawolf sub . The Jimmy Carter . We 've got a scrubbed trip eight for a captain . Damn it , Cameron , you 're supposed to burn the endos . - What is happening with you ? - I 've planted an explosive in my skull , near my chin . It 's a small amount , but it 's enough . I saw the metal , and she knows that I saw it . Master your fear . Remember the mission . I can 't go back there . You are here to keep John Connor away from her . - I can get her to tell me the truth . - Stay away from her . Cameron was supposed to kill me ! You knew that was the only thing that would turn John against her . I rescued you from hell ! And I took you to paradise . You don 't need to be so dramatic . It 's a milk run . A milk run across 8,000 miles of metal-infested ocean . Are you gonna be like this every time I ship out ? Listen , Jesse , I 'm going on a mission , too . I see . One of those missions . It 's something else . - It 's different . - Different . How 's it different ? What does different mean ? Different means different . Just listen to me . You 're stuck in a can under the ocean , with one of those things ... Don 't worry about Queeg . He 's a good bloke . He 's not a bloke . Jesse , he 's not on our side . Don 't ever think that . Aim for the chip . Aim for the chip , they don 't get up . I love you too . Means " I 'll see you later . " What 're you doing ? Moving . Yeah , well ... Seems about the right time for that . Get your stuff sorted . I 'm nearly done with the living room , I 'm gonna start on the garage . Why don 't you let me take the garage ? I got a lot of memory cards and flash drives . I need to sort through . I don 't want us to save our Dakara Records and torch my old copy of Space Invaders . It 's all yours . Thanks . Great , it looks like a robot serial killer lives here . I guess one does . I 'm doing inventory . Don 't do it here . We need to clear all this stuff out before mom comes in and finds it . Dig a hole out back . Down below the retaining wall . We 'll bury the parts and come back for them later . We have to find a place to burn them . And we will burn them . What you drinking ? I don 't know . You don 't know what you 're drinking ? There 's booze in it . Some sugary crap to cut the hell outta the burning taste , and some ice . 'Course , this one 's pretty much empty . Can you get her another one of ... whatever she 's drinking ? How do you order it ? Just like you did . But it 's gotta start somewhere . You can 't just sit down and ask for it . - What happened to your face ? - Lot of questions for a guy who wants to get in my pants . - Do I ? - Yeah , see ... there 's another one . That 's a nice costume . You thinking about a career in the military ? Actually , I fly P-3S . For the Navy . - Brown shoe . - Guilty as charged . - You ? - Submarine . - Bubblehead . - A bubblehead ! They let women on subs in Australia ? Reprogrammed killer robots too . Yeah , we don 't discriminate . Well , there 's a coincidence . I hunt subs , you drive subs . Sort of like the wolf and the sheep dog . Not that I 'm comparing you to a dog , or anything . That 's a good point , actually . In fact , I just remembered something . - What 's that ? - Sheep dogs hate wolves . And I hate brown shoes . I can 't believe you guys are just up and moving like this . You could let me throw a party . You know you never did come to dinner . Tape . It 's okay . It 's not like you 're moving to Mars . We can still totally keep in touch . Absolutely . - Let me help you with that . - I 'm good . Sit down . You know , I 'm fine . People say it takes a while to get back to fighting trim , but I snapped back like a rubber band . Yeah , mostly like a rubber band . You look great . I 'm thinking if I can breastfeed him till he 's five , maybe I can trick my body into letting me keep these boobs . Kidding . Sort of . - Who 's got the baby ? - Trevor . He 's ... He 's not back , he 's just visiting . He said he needed some daddy-time . I don 't blame him . Not after the call they got last night . They found a girl in the river . Shot through the chest . Trevor had said that it looked like she 'd been executed . That 's terrible . Pretty little blonde thing . Probably moved here from Iowa or something to be an actress , and fell in with the wrong people . Dreams die hard . Then Trevor said all they have to go on are some scars from an attempted suicide and a tattoo on her wrist . A pretty little star . Right here . Your mother 's coming . All right , quick . Hide this stuff . I need to talk to John . Alone . Goodbye , bird . There 's a 51 % chance I wouldn 't have killed you . I know . I heard you . Riley 's dead . Episode 2x18 : Today Is The Day v 1.00 Subtitles : Projet-SG Was it you ? Did you kill her ? What if I did ? Don 't play games with me . I need the truth . I didn 't kill her . - I wanna believe you . - Believe me . Sometimes you lie to me . Yes . I do , but I 'm not lying now . I am sorry . You 're sorry ? For what ? For your loss . I really wish I could believe that too . So are you gonna say anything ? Thanks . Thanks . For bailing me out . Thanks . - I know you don 't like police stations . - Maybe that 's because I 'm a fugitive . I know . - So thanks . - What happened ? I told you , I got in a fight . With four naval aviators . Really just three . One of them went down pretty quick . What 's going on ? Nothing . I don 't believe you . I need to know what the hell 's going on . I told you . Nothing . - We crossed the line yet ? - Not yet . Give it a tick . Zero degrees north , heading south-southwest over the equator . Now we 've crossed the line . One nice thing about metal driving the boat , a schedule 's a schedule . One nice thing . - That mean we 're done ? - Quiet , you . Proclamation . Know ye , that sonarman second class Christopher Garvin , on the 13th day of September , 2027 , aboard USS Jimmy Carter , appeared at the equator at latitude zero , longitude 180 , entering into our royal domain , and having been inspected and found worthy by my royal staff , was initiated into the solemn mysteries of the Ancient Order of the Deep . I command my subjects to honor and respect him as one of our trusty shellbacks . Now rise , shellback . - Never gets old , does it ? - Never . Depth charge ? General quarters , go . Go ! Come and play hide and seek , mommy . - I 'm working . - But you promised . Patience is a virtue , Savannah . To tolerate delay . It implies self-control and forbearance . As opposed to wanting what we want when we want it . Something to think about . Would you like to play hide and seek ? My daughter , Savannah ... She 's missing . She 's in the building , Mr. Ellison . We just have to find her . - There 's 23 stories . - Yes . And there 's someone who knows what 's going on in all of them . John Henry , we 're looking for my daughter , Savannah . - Have you seen her today ? - Yes , I have . She wanted to play a game . - Where is she now ? - She 's hiding . Tell us where she 's hiding . That 's not how the game works . How 's the game work ? Hide and seek , there are many variations . The one we 're playing , you guess what I 'm thinking , I give you a clue . Listen to me , John Henry . You 're gonna tell me where Savannah is , and you 're gonna tell me now . I 'm thinking of a country . Come again ? Let 's play the game . This is ridiculous ! I 'm not gonna bargain with a computer . If I 'm not mistaken , Mr. Ellison , we 've got no choice . You hit him in the mouth , didn 't you ? Never aim for the mouth . - What 's that ? - Antibiotic . You know , one time when Kyle and I were kids , we saw two tunnel trolls go at it over a can of stewed tomatoes . The loser got three teeth knocked out , and the winner ... got a blood infection from his split knuckles and died a week later . The human mouth is filthy . You got that ? What ? Damn . John okay ? All right . Hold tight , I 'm on my way . John 's ... girlfriend is dead . A cyborg did it . - You know that for sure ? - Who else could it be ? - What are you gonna do ? - About the metal ? What are you gonna do ? Because you can 't kill her , Derek . - What ? - That 's not something you can do . He has to make that decision on his own . You 've really thought this through . No . But I think about it . Just like you do . More depth charges . Shook us up a bit , but no damage . They want us to make a mistake . Reveal our position . A lot of metal in the water , Captain . Barrage . - Getting closer . - ASW bots . - How many ? - Travel in packs , no way to tell . Mister Gavin ? Not ASW bots . Oh , man . Oh , man . Kraken . We got a kraken . - You sure ? - Bet my life on it . - Feed the sonar picture to tactical . - Aye , ma 'am . You 're a big fellow , aren 't you ? And you 're very far from home . That can 't be right . - Where are we ? - Chief of the boat , status of our torpedo stock ? Two , maybe three I 'd consider worth using in a fight . Ready tube one . Hold for my order . Queeg . You can 't fight a kraken with one torpedo . Or three . We need to break contact and find a way around . Mister Garvin , active sonar , please . One ping only . One ping , aye . Torpedo in the water . Closing fast . Maybe ... 40 seconds . Status on my torpedo ? - Torpedo ready , but ... - Thirty second fuse . Match our speed and bearing after breakaway . Fire . You heard him . Fire . - Torpedo away . - Still closing , 55 knots . You got us 20 degrees down bubble . Ahead , full . Queeg , you 're tak ... Taking the boat to 729.8 meters . - Crush depth . - To the edge of crush depth . The kraken won 't be able to follow . The sonar will reflect off the thermocline layer . - We 'll be ... - Invisible . We 're playing dead . - Eight seconds to torpedo contact . - Approaching crush depth . If he 's off by even a millimeter , for even a fraction of a second ... He won 't be . This is what he does . Two detonations . Our torpedo and theirs . 1,100 meters to starboard . 120 on the Z. And now we roll over , stick out our tongue , and hold our breath . Skipper , we 're at 729.8 . I 'm aware , Chief . Thank you . 729.8 ... and holding . You may return to your duty stations now . You heard the Captain , people . What , you 've never been 20 centimeters from your maker ? Move . Skipper , when we 're done skating over our deaths ... I got a question . Why are we 300 miles off course ? We were using it for research . - To find out what ... - Don 't . John , just don 't . Don 't make excuses for her . Don 't cover for her . - I knew about the parts . - I 'm not talking about the parts . I 'm talking about Riley . Well , there 's nothing to talk about , is there ? Because Riley 's dead . How do you think that happened ? I don 't know . I 'm gonna figure it out , though . You know , John . We both know . Cameron didn 't do it . How can you say that ? How can you be so sure ? Because I 'm sure . And I know her . And she told me . She told you ? Just like she told you she destroyed every part we ever captured ? Just like she tells us what she does every night when we go to sleep ? When she comes back in the morning , she 's covered in cuts and bruises . Just like she told you she loved you ? You don 't know anything . I 'm thinking of an herb . Tarragon ? We 're wasting time . But it 's working . His game . What is wrong with you ? Why are you not angry ? Why should I be ? We have a way to get her back . Tell me where the child is . Look . You asked me to teach him ethics , morals , and rules . What good is it if he 's not gonna follow them ? He will . If we let him learn the rules on his own . Oregano . Correct . See there . A lucky guess . Lucky . Give us our clue . The sun is shining on Savannah . Security . Check near all windows . Anyplace light is coming through . Copy . I 'm thinking of an animal . Antelope . Lion . Horse . - Bird ! - Correct . - Give us our clue . - The answer is the clue . What ? What does that mean ? Just what he said . Bird is our clue . I know where she is . Security . Meet us at the elevators . Savannah , are you okay ? Go to your mother . You found me , mommy . Yes , darling ... I did . Aaron ? I remember . Is Riley around ? No , she didn 't come home last night . Riley didn 't come home . Thanks . Foster kids ... That 's the way it is with them sometimes . They drift into your life , then they drift back out again . Not always according to plan . She 's a tough one , too . Good heart , as I 'm sure you know , but ... tough to know . I really really needed to talk to her . I don 't know if you could maybe just take a message for me ... - See , last time that we spoke ... - Hang on a sec . God , Riley ! Are you all right ? - Where are you ? - Everything 's fine . I 'm in Riverside , it 's a long story . Everything 's fine . We 've been worried sick . We were about to call the police . Please don 't do that . Everything 's fine . John , too ... he 's here . Really ? Can I talk to him ? Me ? You 're in Riverside ? Listen ... we 'll talk ... when I see you . I thought you 'd wanna hear my voice . You know you 're really freaking everybody out , right ? Am I freaking you out , now ? - So let 's talk later . - I 'm sorry . It 's just ... I 've been thinking about my parents a lot . And there are things I can 't get out of my head . And I just thought if I came out and saw where we used to live ... I know ... Stupid , right ? We 'll talk about all this in person . When you get back . We 're hanging up now . Sure . That would be great . I love you . - What the hell was that about ? - What was what about ? What happened just now . It was the plan . No . The plan was to call the foster parents . The plan was to let him hear her voice . That 's what I did . That 's not all you did . What you did was not the plan . The plan was to make him think she 's still alive ... So he wouldn 't go to the police . You became part of that plan . Your reaction made it more authentic . Don 't you think it was more authentic that way ? Where are we going now ? We 're not going anywhere . I 'm going somewhere . And I 'm gonna go alone . - You shouldn 't be alone . - Yes , I should . Did you have fun playing the game , Mr. Ellison ? No , John Henry . I did not . Why not ? Because what you did made me very , very angry . - I don 't understand . - You kept a secret . Is it wrong to keep a secret ? The secret you kept could 've harmed Savannah . What if we couldn 't have found her ? What if she 'd fallen from the roof and died ? Then she wouldn 't be alive anymore . And her life is important . Human life is sacred . If she had died ... it would 've been your fault . My fault ? Because you were the only one who knew where she was . And you made a choice not to tell . That was the wrong choice . I 'm thinking about Riley . What the cyborg did to her . It 's a terrible thing . But ... if John realizes what the metal is ... What it really does ... Maybe some good can come of it . Maybe you can help him see that . Good ? An innocent kid is dead . Because that metal bitch murdered her in cold blood . No good comes out of that . None . Not ever . You 're a good man . Oh , yeah ? Don 't let anyone tell you different . - Hoo-roo . - Hoo-roo . We 've been bearing 30 degrees off course for four hours . Into a major Skynet zone . - What 's going on ? - Our new mission required it . What mission ? Where are we headed ? A deepwater oil platform near the Indonesian Archipelago . Lieutenant Dietz and his team will board the rig and retrieve a package . We will deliver this package to Seranno Point . We have important cargo to take to Perth . - Components . Vaccines ... - Our orders come from John Connor . These orders from John Connor ... Do they say what we 're after ? What it is ? Yes . They say what the package is . Right . Please inform the crew . Thank you . Just stay sharp , you 'll be fine . I know I 'll be fine . I got this . I 'm serious , Dietz . I 'm always serious about being fine . You do me one favor . You see anything you don 't like , you think before you pull that trigger . I 've been seeing things I don 't like since J-Day . You don 't get to be my age without thinking first . I swear , Mom . We 'll hold hands before we cross the street . ASDS has cut engines , Commander . I think we 're clear for comms . ASDS , this is Carter . Over . Hey , Mom . I 'll say this much about a deep-sea oil rig ... Second-worst thing I 've ever smelled . Dark as night out here . We 're gonna keep this channel open . Maintain radio silence till you 've got the package . Planning on it . Connor sent me . John Connor . I 've come for that . That 's for him . I 'm here to pick it up . I had planned on waiting for you with Derek 's sniper rifle . Pulled the trigger . Solved about 50 % of my problems . One shot . Do you know how bad I 'd have felt ? Very bad . Not bad at all . But I know someone who 'd have felt bad . Someone who 'd have never forgiven me if I 'd have done that . I don 't know what to do with you . You know what the stakes are . You know why we 're here . You know what this means . And yet , here I stand . Burning what 's left of an endoskeleton I 'd thought we 'd burned months ago . I needed spare parts . I don 't care what you need , because this is not about you . It 's not about me . It 's about John . You 're concerned for his safety . - You bet I am . - From Skynet . From me . Maybe . Maybe especially you . We 're all a threat . We 're all a threat to John . He worries about us . That makes him vulnerable . He cares . I am not John 's problem . John is John 's problem . Humans are the problem . There 's only one way for him to be safe . That 's to be alone . What kind of life is that ? John 's life . Someday . I 'm sorry .

 previously on dollhouse : The dollhouse is bigger than I ever thought it was . Every time I look deeper , I find more clients , larger amounts of money and a web of financial and political connections all over the world . I think the dollhouse is underground . Not underground like it 's a secret . Underground like it 's somewhere beneath los angeles . You work for the nsa . you haven 't figured it o ? Use your deductive skills . You 're a doll . Why did you want to bring down the dollhouse ? If it weren 't for me , paul ballard would 've found you already . Do it . congratulations , mr . Langton . For what ? For becoming our new head of security . Boyd : I 've seen this before . Alpha . Alpha is dead . After what he did ... they tracked him down and put a bullet in his brain . They 'd never lie to us about something like that . Would they ? " as soon as the prince kissed her , " the spell was broken and briar rose opened her eyes . " And as she looked at the face " of the handsome young prince , the whole kingdom " began to magically awaken all around the " the cooks in the kitchen and the boys in the yard all rubbed their eyes and looked around them . " This is crap . I 'm sorry ? Crap . Don 't you know what that means ? You don 't like the story , but the others are listening . So , maybe we could talk about this afterwards . The spell was for a hundred years . So , he shows up on the last day and takes credit for saving her ? Okay . What 's your name ? That 's susan . Really ? My name 's susan , too . That 's a really good point , susan . She knew the curse . - " You will touch a poison spindle on your 15th birthday . " - Right . So , if it 's me , I 'm not exploring the castle on my 15th birthday , groping any spindles I find lying around , especially when I think she might 've actually had a vague idea what the hell a spindle is ! I don 't think her parents told her about the curse . If she knew , maybe they could 've hid her . Or she could 've just run away ! Or what about this ? She could 've just woken herself the hell up ! It was a curse ; she couldn 'T ... - just should 've woken herself up ! - susan , stop.That 's enough . Let me go ! - Let me go ! Leave me alone ! - come on . Okay , that 's it for today . Everyone back to your rooms , and i will check . Well , guess i hit a trigger . Yeah , something reminded her of what she 's been through . I 'm not surprised . That story always bugged me , too why I picked it . Sorry if I blew your routine . You ... thought that could happen ? Someone told me I could help her . I was going to ask you to point her out . Guess I didn 't have to . Mellie : But when are you going ? Where ? I don 't know . Is this about caroline ? Did you find her ? No . Were you going to tell me ? If I 'd come by tomorrow instead of today ... paul , talk to me ! What is there to say ? Just tell me why . We 're not good for each other . Around you ... we 're not good for each other . No , no.paul. You 're in my way . You 're under a lot of stress . I 've been smothering you . I 'll back off ; we can take a break . That 's probably a good idea . But just a break is all we need . Can you talk to me anyway ? You think you can 't trust me . And you 're right to pay attention to that feeling but you need to make sure that you 're laying the blame where it deserves to be . Look at me ! Look at the real me , and really think about whether I 've ever told you anything I didn 't believe with all my heart . You know , you just said exactly what I needed to hear . And that 's why I 'm leaving . What ? I 'll deal with this later . Please , this is ... stop being so cruel.Can 't you see this is killing me ? You 'll get over it . Adelle : What 's on it ? Boyd : We don 't know . It was hand delivered for mr . Dominic today . We haven 't been able to unlock the data that 's inside . You think it 's from the nsa ? We know he was their inside man . With him suddenly off their radar , this may be them reaching out , trying to find him . What do we need to open it ? A tech expert ? I mean , surely we ca imprint an active with the skills we need . I think we can assume they 've taken precautions so that mr . Dominic is the only one who can retrieve the data without corrupting it . Well , you 'd better ask mr . Dominic then . Right . Right . Mr. Dominic is in the attic . You don 't really think we should let that stop us , do you ? Woman : We keep placing her in foster homes and she keeps bouncing back . She cuts school and gets in fights . We 've taken five knives off of that girl . Different times . I don 't even know how she gets those . Steals them off other kids , shoplifts them , some deli 's just have cups with steak knives in them on the tables . You can get in and out . The mother died of a drug overdose when she was very young . And the girl was left with the woman 's boyfriend , a small time drug dealer , part time pimp . Probably thinking that she could start earning money for him when she got older , but turned out that last part wasn 't necessary half the age , twe the price . You know anything about susan that wasn 't in the report when they handed her to you ? ' I 'd be shocked if you did . She 's not going to tell you . She lies to her therapist ; she 's useless in group . That 's pretty specific for someone who 's known susan for all of five minutes . I 've known her much longer than that . They 're not the same . They kind of are . Look closer . This one is the imprint I gave echo this morning . This one is the 11 year old . Yeah , I see similar response patterns , Signs of depression and instability . So , what 's the deal ? The kid 's a mess . Past trauma has her emotions , reactions , intellectual development all frakked up beyond recognition . But if she gets help , really works , deals with the soup of her life , she gets to be ... a nice lady with the tragic past but ... the healthy head . Echo 's imprint is the kid grown up ? names and dates , tiny details changed , but in general , yeah , this is her . If she grows up okay . Echo 's like the living example of the kid 's best possible future . So , she thinks she 's a volunteer helping a kid like her ... but she knows exactly what to expect . And the kid sees that maybe there 's a decent future for her . Whole approach , my idea . whole engagement , actually . How did you sell dewitt on it ? Everybody wants to be righteous when they can afford it . Even topher brink . This feeling , it is not unlike pride . topher . okay . End of the pride parade . Tell them to bring up victor . : I don 't know . I don 't know what I did wrong . It 's okay . : I tried so hard . I did everything I could think of . Right here . It was right here . Dollhouse . Season 1 Episode 11 Can I ? you keeping that book ? I 'm fixing it . I see that . They call that editing . You could make a living out of it . You really hate that she didn 't save herself , don 't you ? Of course , she was 15 . That 's pretty big . If she was littler , say - six or seven or eight ... - you can always run away . Really ? I couldn 'T . When did you want to run away ? In the middle of the night , it always seemed like I could run away when it would get light . Sometimes I 'd get dressed and lie there waiting for the sun . But when it came up , he 'd be there , pretending things were normal . And it seemed so much better to just pretend , you know ? It seemed like I 'd imagined all the other stuff , and I really wanted all of that to be something I 'd imagined . And I ended up feeling like I was just as guilty as he was . Like it was a crime we were committing together . And every time someone calls me a victim , I feel like I 'm the biggest liar in the world . Loomis : You can 't keep coming down here . Director 's already giving me suspicious eye . I 'm aware of that , loomis , but this is huge . Look . You carry all this with you ? All this stuff that led me nowhe . Hilarious . Lubov . My connection to the russians . He knew nothing . All dead ends . The farther I reached , the worse I did . But then ... they came to me . Your neighbor ? The one you fingerprinted ? - You 're certain now that she 'S ... - a doll . Well , I was going to say , " a victim . " I followed her to 23 flower . The dollhouse . You just flashed your badge , swooped in on them like prince valiant ? I got no badge unless I swipe yours . besides * * * I pulled a hat over my eyes and went right in , and rode all around in their elevators , - checked out the stairs and the conference rooms . - Oh , yeah ? Wrong building . But I figured it out . I was in the building you can see . I 've got to get in the other one the one that 's invisible . Well , sure . No , no , no , listen to me . This isn 't crazy , okay ? Look , under the one building , there 's another . Underground . Look , caroline said she was underground , right ? So , I looked at all the records for the building at 23 flower . They had all the normal contractors and such , but they also had an environmental systems consultant . this guy . Why would they use him ? He does one thing . He 's an expert in buildings that recycle their own air and water and power . Closed systems . They 're underground , drawing hardly any power , so it 's like ... it 's like they 're invisible . It 's a good thing I 'm relatively sure you 're not crazy . Boyd : We have a job for you , mr . Dominic , if you don 't mind . I 'm in the chair.Of course . Adelle : Mr. Dominic , please . A communication has arrived for you from your handlers at the nsa , and ... we 're really curious about it . Whose hands are these ? Whose body am I in ? Victor ? Okay ... okay . No ... no . so , me my body I 'm , I 'm in the attic . I knew it.I knew it ! And now you want me to help ? ! After doing that ! Doctor ? Sedate him , please . No ... topher . Adelle , please , come on , don 'T ... don 't give me the shot , please . Don 't give ... whiskey . He wants a drink instead . I 'm not surprised . No . No . oh , god . that was ... necessary . Doctor , he 's calm now . Is there perhaps something else we can give him to make him more receptive to our questions ? no . No , I 'd rather not . Right . Let 's get started . I know . I know , they always think that.Tell an adult . Tell a teacher . Tell a priest . But if he says he knows them all , - that they won 't believe you ... - he said he knew the cops . All of the cops . did you have a chance you didn 't take ? Four times . Four times , I saw a way to go , and I didn 't go . You couldn 't have gotten away . He was bigger and stronger and older . It 's okay . It 's okay to get rescued by someone else if you 're young or small or you just can 't do it yourself . Hey , you know this story ? Yeah . Read it again , okay ? But this time ... think of yourself as the prince . I didn 't save anyone . Hey , remember what you said . The prince shows up at the last minute , takes all the credit . That means briar rose was trapped all that time , sleeping ... and dreaming of getting out . The prince was her dream . She made him . She made him fight to get her out . Prince . The prince was a boy . Yeah , but that 's not his fault . Woman : Susan ? There 's a van here for you . And it 's the kids ' dinnertime . I got to go . Okay . I 'll come back . Okay . Susan . You let me sit here very close to you . You felt safe . Which tells me ... you got a blade on you somewhere , so just give it to me now , and I won 't tell anyone . Thank you . Good talk ? A start . Well , did you tell her you 're going to come back ? Yeah . It will be a little while , though . Just ... be ready . She 's close to moving forward , but it 's going to hurt . are you stephen kepler ? Okay . what was that name again ? Stephen kepler is that you ? well , * * * * * * * * question . You 're not from the thai place , are you ? Yeah.I wanted tofu satay . Don 't worry . You 're not in any trouble , but you are an expert in a field I am ... interested in . Can I come in and talk for a minute ? Let 's talk out here.It 's nice . The hallway goes ... down there all the way , and ... there 's lots of ... spacious ... air . Am I still breathing ? no . carrots . medicinal carrots . Personal use for medicinal carrots that were here when I moved in , and I 'm holding it for a friend . You design environmental systems . Yeah , th that 's my thing . self contained . Renewable everything . I mean ... the ultimate goal is , complete self sufficiency , but without a lot of money , you know , the best you can hope to do is to offset your carbon footprint . You know , I care about my carbon footprint , but most people out there are ... making carbon snow angels . You know earth day was last week ? - I haven 't been . - Hilarious . Earth gets one day . All right , the other 364 , we 're ... we 're cranking the ac in our hummer , and then , one day a year , ooh , we 'll separate the plastic . you know what I think ? I think that once we die out a couple hundred years earth is going to have a " people day . " You know , to remember us . One day a year , she is going to laugh and laugh and shake our bones . Recycled urine ? : I 'm kidding . It it ... it 's not fully recycled . I 'm tinkering with that . I also have pom . Let 's say I do have a lot of money . You can design a truly self contained system ? air , water , heat . You wouldn 't even have to use the gD ... maybe a little , depending on how big it is . So , you can make a building disappear ? only if you paint it exactly like what 's behind it , and then you stand ... but you could bury it underground . Underground ... it 's best , you know , insulation , structural integrity . You don 't have a lot of money . I 'm looking for something . Yeah , no , you need to make an appointment with stacy . You could e mail me ... don 't e mail me . You know , I 'm not comfortable having people in my home that aren 't delivering me thai food , and I 'm not talking about past clients . Tell me about the dollhouse . Ah , man . I told you , you 're not in trouble . You are naive . They will kill me , and you , and then kill me again.Please. I shouldn 't have said anything . And now there 's a gun . You built the dollhouse . I built the shell . Can you open the shell ? What if I don 't tell you ? Probably . But I don 't know where it is . That was years ago . You know , I I I designed it from here . I never leave here , man . Then , this will be a real adventure for you . You 're coming with me . Why would I choose to do that ? I don 't remember using the word " choose . " There is a girl named caroline being held there against her will . Now , I 'm the only person who knows how to find the dollhouse , and you 're the only person who knows how to get in . And as much as it pains me to say it , that makes you my new partner . then , can i hold the gun ? Victor : Never saw it before . Adelle : Come on . It 's from your best friends and handlers at the nsa . No , it isn 'T . We didn 't communicate that way . We have phones . It came in an envelope . It was hand delivered . Who else would be trying to contact you covertly ? Alpha . I guess he didn 't hear about the regime change . Let 's open it . What 's it going to be ? I don 't know . He never sent me anything before . Whether it 's from the nsa or from alpha makes no difference . It 's intended that you should be able to open it . Therefore , you should be able to open it . We just need a password that you would guess . It shouldn 't be hard . Alpha . Too easy . Try it . If we 're wrong , it could all disappear . Wait . Alpha ? Just like that ? Alpha ? He used to sign his stuff in art class like that . They thought it was a fish , but it was his name over and over again . First sign something was different . He means the greek letter . Try a greek alpha . - How ... ? - Change font . Boyd : Paul bunyan ? Did not anticipate that . There 's a lot of those statues in northern plains cities wisconsin , michigan , minnesota . Tucson . What ? I 've see that dreadful statue from the window of the center in tucson . What 's the center ? Never you mind . Is that the dollhouse hq ? Because I 've always wondered ... adelle : I 've got to make some calls , get them to increase their security . If alpha is in tucson god ! They found a body in an alley in tucson this morning . Slashed with a knife . Send sierra . So , um ... back on the shelf ? look , if we could take some time , then we could prepare . We could get some supplies . We could get some rope.Rope is always good . We have to go now . because why ? They had a spy watching me . Someone ... close to me , who turned out to be a doll . Is this the fabled caroline ? Someone else . So I figure I 've got a day or two before they figure out I know ... and kill me . This this other doll are you 're going to save her , too . No . She told me herself she can 't be trusted . She warned me . After I get caroline out , I can come back . Come on . We 're here ? So soon . let 's go around the block . Come out . Come on , man ! This is like one of those buddy cop movies where you 're the hard nosed fbi agent and I 'm the guy who hates buddy cop movies . Get out of the car or I show the dea your carrot plantation . Okay.Okay. I am sorry to do this . But we 've got to get in there and save her . Then what ? We go in there , then we 're in there . There 'S ... there 's more people in there . I 'm not good with people . They 're not people . I 'm not good with that sentence eltr . the helicopter better be waiting , because whatever is up with this body of yours , it 's changing every minute . Tissue 's breaking down from bacteria , the body 's own chemicals . You 've got putrefaction , fermentation . And not to mention the effects of insects and other animals , then you got the elements : Rain , condensation ... one fbi trained forensic specialist . It 's a tall order for a rush job . Sorry about that . It 's all right . It 's a quiet night anyway . Echo 's just coming in , and then we 're sleepy bye . How far ? Ten stories . It 's the best way in.I 'm sorry , man , it 's just how it is . - Let 's go . - No.No way . You 'd go down there ? You showed me this thinking I 'd give up ? I was nurturing a tender throbbing hope that you 'd give up , yes ! Well , I 'm not . Show me the real way in . No , that 's the real way in . I just thought that you 'd give up . wish we had rope . hello , echo . How are you feeling ? Did I fall asleep ? Stephen : Falling ! Falling now ! you 're not falling . I have your ankles . Let go ! Okay , no , no , no , no . Don 't let go . Ankles , ankles , ankles , ankles ankles , ankles ! no.No. Riding up , riding up ... I 'm getting a wedgie . say , this is ... clean and enclosed.I 'm staying here . Come on . just because we can move forward , we must ? You know , this is the same expansionist thinking that lead to the trail of tears , man . Carrots . " One day , a hundred years later , " a young prince heard about briar rose " and of the deep sleep and the sharp thorns . " The prince said , " ' I will not let this stop me . " ' I 'm as strong as any spell . " ' I 'm as strong as any thorns . " ' I won 't let anything stop me from reaching her and saving her . ' " " ' I will go and rescue the sleeping beauty . ' " It 's real . You know , this is pretty unusual , federal agents in the middle of the night shift . It 's a high priority case . This thing hit the system and bells went off all over the fbi , from quantico to the tiny telephone in hoover 's casket . so ... it 's a signature you 're looking at ? Yeah . Someone 's getting slash happy . All homeless guys ? Clearly not . Homeless people smell primarily like human excretions sweat , urine . This guy ... this guys smells like garbage over a layer of clean skin . Not even old garbage , either.He ... he smells like yesterday 's breakfast , not last week 'S . I think I 'll take over from here . They told me this was going to be the a new eden . Eden wasn 't a prison . What , are you kidding ? The apples were monitored . Plus , they didn 't have a steam room that could recirculate human sweat and put it right back ... we 're going to be on camera the moment we set foot in there . But remember my plan where we don 't ? Can you do anything about their surveillance ? From a computer , probably . Their fail safe should be on the same system as the life support cycles I designed . But we 'd have to access one and until then , we suffer from unsightly visibility . Wait here . If you 'll come this way , please . I am not good with people . Not good with the blood and viscera of people , okay ? Take off your clothes . What , you 're gonna dress li a doll ? Those probably won 't even fit a guy ... oh , no , come come on ! This is ... I 'm not comfortable . : My arms are chilly . Shut up . Oh , change is good . Go change . Yes , we can ! You know , this cotton it 's organic , I 'm pretty sure . That 's a plus . I 'm going to die.I 'm going to die in pajamas . Person I don 't know . Actually , I 'm from upstairs.Security review . I have a work order here . Maybe you can ... what the hell was that ? Is that some kind of like joy buzzer stun gun ? I mean , officially , I deplore the violence , but that was totally worth the loss of karma points . Help . Computer . You can take down security from there , right ? I could , if this guy wasn 't a paranoid freak . There 's like a thrillion layers of passwords on here . This isn 't company stuff . This is his own personal minefield . I need a different computer . Let 's go . Wait.Wait.Hold on . Let me watch for a minute , see if I can notice a pattern , security patrols , anything . All right , would you look at this place ! I mean , first of all , feng shui up the ying yang . Also , I designed parts of it , but I did not design the stone cold foxes in the small clothes , and the ample massage facilities . : I mean , don 't get me wrong , I heart my porn , but this is cool . This is a bad place . Bad people , maybe . Good place . Man , this is the future . The machine feeds them what they need , the machine takes away what it needs . A closed system , the earth is not harmed . Yeah , we 're all just cells in a body . Cells in a body ? That 's the future ? We 're all functional , interchangeable ? We already are , man . What , you didn 't you know that ? I was trying to tell you , you know , we 're all just atoms in the big continuous universe and the best , th best that we can do is to try not to kill it from the inside . No . There 's more we can do . yeah , okay . If you really think you have a choice . Let 's go.There 's a lull in traffic . Come on . : There should be offices down this way , if I remember correctly . What ? The stairs lack risers . What ? The vertical part that makes the back of each stair is called a riser . I know what they are . Okay , wait , hold , hold.Okay , see , sometimes when I go on stairs that don 't have risers , I get this feeling , this awful sensation , that something 's going to just reach out and grab my ankle like a claw or a tentacle . This is life or death . Could be a hand , could be an ordinary hand . Come on ! hurry up . There 's a terminal in there . If I can get to that , I can shut down all the security . I can open this place up like an oyster we can go out in the elevator , as pretty as you please . Okay , fine . Oh , god . I know that guy lubov . My whole life . My whole life isn 't real . It 's a small world , right ? I went to grade school with jenna elfman . Just point me to where they sleep . Is it that way ? : Cool off . Man , think . You know , c compose yourself mentally , man . Prepare . what are you doing ? The best that I can , mr . I stun all my problems . I don 't know how to slam all the doors shut on the security areas , but I do know how to adjust the oxygen nitrogen co2 mix in their rooms , so they won 't wake up if the alarms go off . Okay . Do that . Now , the dolls I designed the sleeping compartments that collects the carbon dioxide and methane everybody farts and cycles it all into the environmental controls . - What ? - You need to know this . The pods are locked . She 's locked into a pod ? There are lights inside . If the light is on , the pod is locked . Do not try to open a locked pod . All hell will break loose , my tall man . As I unlock each pod remotely , the light will go off . Wait . Go . Okay . I said go . The course is clear . Go now ! All right . Down ... that hallway . Wait . Oh , no.That 's right . they flip a switch , you 'll kill me without even knowing it . I 'm sorry . caroline . sorry , agent ballard . You don 't get the girl . Give me your gun . - I don 't have A ... - you didn 't come in here without one . Put it on the floor now . Who are you ? I 'm paul . You lied me . You asked me to come get you . Boyd : Echo , why don 't you go for a swim ? Ballard : Your name is caroline . - You 've been brainwashed . - Echo , go ! you hurt paul . Echo . What are you , then , her pimp ? You get her ready , send her out , clean her up after ? I keep her safe . You think you 're helping her.You 're wrong . You can 't get her out . I got in . I could 've brought the whole house down on you , but I 'm giving you one chance . Go back the way you came.Now. Boyd : Echo , run ! I 'm supposed to go swimming . Caroline , you don 't have to do what they tell you . I know you 're scared , but it 's okay . Let me go ! Yoheard the lady . alarms ... off . Backup alarm ... calling out.No. calling ... in.No. Motion sensors ... disabled . Manual alarm disabled . pod locks switched . Victor , what happened ? people were fighting on me . backup doors reinforced . Security team ... sawing wood . think they 'll just let her go ? let her live outside ? She 's not ... living now . Even if you got her out alive , they 'd hunt you down and kill you both . lower oxygen , up the co2 . Stay asleep . stay asleep . boyd : I 'm going to get you ... echo : We have to stop . Boyd : No . Echo . Run . Run ! Run ! stay here.Wait for me . I 'll come back to get you . I trust you . all right , we 'll have you fixed up in ... alpha . well , you kept my gift . Yes.Of course . Now you . Yes . Of course . They 're unique , you know . turns out different every time . Victor 's , for example . they 're much deeper . have you always ... wanted to be a doctor ? It 's a simple question . Answer now . Yes . That 's a lie . Let 's try another . Did you really think you could just walk into the dollhouse ? When everyone knows it doesn 't exist ? Tell me about the first time you met me . You were new . You had signed the a agreement , and they 'd just ... you 'd just beep wiped for the first time . Your handler brought you to me for an exam . And did you examine me ? My whole body ? Yes . And was I fine ? Healthy ? Intact ? Yes . This is so teresting . I wish we had more time . We don 't have time ? You are digging yourselves in so deep , you have no idea . I 'm a federal agent . - You 've been suspended.-The penalties for interfering with a federal agent - you are no longer protected by those laws . - in the performance of his ... You really justify this ? What you do to these people ? You can live with this ? You 're the one who came in here and assaulted one of our residents . Adelle : Yes.There 's indignation enough for everyone to have seconds . If you really didn 't want me here , then maybe you shouldn 't have filled my life with so many interesting lies ... you have been quite a challenge . Oh , is that why you tried to kill me ? Twice ? It might be good for us both that I failed . I don 't even care that these people signed themselves over to you . There is no provision for ... for ... consensual slavery . It is wrong . You know it 's wrong . You feel it in your bones . What you did to caroline is wrong . You know so many things . Facts and names . What do you think , mr . Langton ? What do you mean ? Shall we put him in the chair ? Saunders : Echo ? Come here , please . echo . I know you . I remember something about you . I remember everything about you . It 's okay . It 'll be all right . Adelle : You know I don 't need your consent . Boyd : You asked my opinion . In my opinion , this man hasn 'agreed to this , and his crime isn 'T ... dewitt . Sierra : Yeah , this is special agent gerhardt calling for the director . Go ahead . Didn 't want you to have to wait for my report , madam director . The mo is right for your suspect . That 's a positive . The name we got on the vic is stephen J.Kepler. Stephen J.Kepler. Got it . He was some kind of specialist in environmental design . The interesting part is that he wasn 't killed in tucson . He was killed in los angeles and planted here . Boyd : Kepler 's in our system . He 's got a subcontractor number from ten years back . He helped build the dollhouse . Alpha isn 't in tucson . oh , I know you . Of course you do . I told you I 'd come rescue you . My prince . Dollhouse . Season 1 Episode 11

 I want you to remind Riddlemeyer that his only priority is to find Bob . That 's the deal we made . That 's why his ass isn 't in jail . We made a mistake . - We moved past animal trials weeks ago . - We have to go back , Mr. Roth . So , other than some mild headaches , you 're certain Dr. Melnikov 'll be fine ? - Probably anxious about his condition . - To be expected . - Giving us a window of 2 to 3 months . - That 's all the time I need . Take care , my friend . Thanks . You 're getting good at this . - I need Rachel . Where the hell is she ? - I don 't know . He was operated on . On his brain ? Why ? Hi , David . Hi , Bob . - What did he have you doing ? - I can 't remember , David . I 'd like to introduce you to Olivier Roth . - Dr. Sandström . - Son of a bitch ! What did you do ? I am not the enemy here , Dr. Sandström . His MRI looks fine , swelling is way down , and blood 's good . - The Propofol is gone from his system ? - Completely . He does not have any side effects . - He can 't remember the last 3 months ... - Not because of the coma we induced . More likely trauma complications from the infection ... Or the fact that somebody did surgery on his brain ? Could be . And he could fully recover his memories - if you work with him . - Alright . Thanks , Doctor . - I like your book so far . - Thank you . Mad , Bad and Dangerous . Science Beyond the Brink . Who came up with that title ? - It 's just ... get back to ... - Wait . What is it ? I don 't remember , David . Alright . What about names ? - Jim ? Dennis ? Elvis ? - Hi , Bob ! - Grey . - What ? What about Grey ? The walls of Roth 's lab were grey . Okay . There you go . We got grey walls . Anything else ? I was running from something . And I was scared .

Doctor says he should rest a couple more days . He 's going to stay with David . But he 's gonna be alright , right ? David says he 's sharp as ever , but emotionally he 's got some issues . If I couldn 't remember the last 3 months , I 'd have emotional issues too . You sure you don 't wanna grab something to eat ? No , I don 't think so . Why don 't you come on in and help out for a while ? You know , atone for your sins . - I do volunteer work here . - Okay . - Hey there . - It 's not good , Rachel . Oh , my God . Rachel . You hear about it ? - What the hell is going on ? - They 're dead . Four of ' em . - Just didn 't wake up . - What happened ? They just died . That 's Paulie . He used to come in here for clean needles . - Think he OD 'd ? - I don 't know that . Jaundice sure says liver failure , though . That 's Jenny . Jenny ? She was just fine a week ago . So was Paulie . - It 's just not natural . - Do you have an idea how this happened ? - Word is we 're not the only shelter . - You 're kidding ! What have you heard ? They 're sayin ' it 's all over Toronto . Some kind of epidemic . It 's almost like God 's trying to get rid of us . I don 't think anybody 's trying to get rid of you . Let 's go see if the city 's here . We gotta close this place down . - You okay ? - Yeah . Good . Are you Department of Health ? - Yes . - I 'm Rachel Wood , I 'm with NorBAC . This is our Director of Operations , Weston Field . Who called you in ? Actually it 's my day off . I volunteer here . - I 'm Dr. Martin Cove . - Nice to meet you . So what 's going on ? We 've had multiple cases of intravenous drug users dying of liver failure . - Just in the shelters ? - No . All over the city . Cabbagetown . Yorkville . Harbourfront . So what are we thinking ? Bad drugs ? Hepatitis ? We should know that after we get a look at their blood . That 's what we 're doing . - Dr. Cove , we 're ready . - Alright . - We have people at each door ? - We do . Excuse me . May I have your attention , please ? Quiet down . We are experiencing an outbreak of an unknown nature . You are all potentially at risk . Therefore you 'll all need to be tested before anyone leaves this building . Which is now , by order of the Department of Public Health , under quarantine . Thank you . You must know some of the people here . Would you mind lending us a hand ? Sure , whatever you 'd like . Thank you . Hi , I 'm Megan . Just here for breakfast . I 'll pass . She knows , everybody knows , I 've been clean for 6 weeks and I never shared needles . That 's right . But if it 's hepatitis , you can get it . I was tested a month ago , okay ? I 'm clean . Yeah , but tattoos , or sharing razor blades , or ... Sex . I 've had one partner in the last 5 years . I know , but it 's very serious . I don 't think you should be taking any chances . I appreciate it , Rachel . I just don 't want nobody sticking ' me . But you have been an intravenous drug user ? - Not anymore . - But you still need to be tested . You know why ? ' Cause sometimes this stuff stays dormant , right ? - Okay . - Yep . I 'll do that . I 'm afraid that I can 't let you do that . - You 'll never find a vein . - I can 't let you do it on your own . - I don 't want you poking me ! - Trust me , I 've got plenty of practice . Was it clean ? - Absolutely , It didn 't break the skin . - Sure ? - 100 percent sure . - I 'm sorry , I just didn 't wanna ... No , no , it 's okay . It 's alright , Glenn . It 's okay now . - What 's going on ? - Nothing . We 're okay . - Did you get his blood yet ? - No . Sir ? Now , we can do this the hard way or we can do this my way . I 've looked at over a dozen dead bodies in the last 6 hours ... all intravenous drug users . - I don 't do ... - At one time or another . Now please , sir . I 'm only trying to help you , possibly even save your life . Appreciate a little cooperation . Come on , Glenn . Two minutes and I 'll buy you a burger . Only reason I 'm doing this , is because of her . Thank you . - Rachel . - Yeah . I ran the ELISA analysis on the blood . It 's Hepatitis C. Heavy viral load , consistent with acute infection . But you need to take a look at this . - Why so many new cases ? - I don 't know . Hep C rarely damages the liver this badly . It usually causes more of a long-term chronic infection . But this Hep C strain is looking more and more interesting . This is the patient 's blood yesterday . I wanted to double-check the results . I took another sample . The same patient 's blood , less than 24 hours later . I know the Hep C virus replicates like crazy , but ... - 1,000 times in 24 hours ? - It 's exactly what I thought . So ... I checked the control experiments . Everything looks fine . RNA tests confirmed it . - We should get David 's head around . - Get my head around what ? Hey ! I thought you weren 't back until tomorrow ! Yeah , Bob clubbed a nurse and made a break for it . That 's not funny , David . - Welcome back , stranger . - Hello , Rachel . Sorry I didn 't let you know where I was ... - Welcome back . - Hey , Carlos . It 's good to be back . - Sorry I didn 't let you know where I ... - Bob , enough with the " sorries , " okay ? Sorry . Gimme a minute . Excuse me . David , I 'm feeling fine . I just wanna get back to work . Couple more days of rest , Bob . It 's either my place or the hospital . Oh , my God , Bob ! Hey ! - I don 't know why I did that . - It 's okay . I 'm sorry . I ... - I 'm glad to see you too . - I just got confused . Can I leave you two alone ? Yeah . - I missed you too . - Oh , God . Oh God , the last time I saw you , you had me pretty freaked out , Bob . I seem to have adjusted . I 'm OK now . I 'm ... able to control my feelings . - Really ? - Most of the time . But the last 3 months are in pieces . Just now , you know , before , when I kissed you ... Bob , don 't worry about it . You were a piece of the puzzle ... But I don 't know what . We 'll just have to start putting it all together then . Thank you , Mayko . - So , what 's been going on ? - Mayko ! Get Carlos and Rachel . Conference room in 5 minutes . Just a lot of that . Grumpy . - I don 't know why I did that . - It 's okay . I 'm sorry . I ... - Hey , I 'm glad to see you too . - I just got confused . Can I leave you two alone ? Yeah . I want Roth . Good luck . You gotta find him , Wes . I need some answers . - To ? - For a start , what he did to Bob . Why didn 't you ask when you had the chance ? 'Cause I didn 't realize Bob was going to have a huge hole in his memory . Roth is not an easy guy to find , David . However Riddlemeyer has been spinning the guy lately , we know for a fact that Roth has been the money behind some very questionable research . And he 's got a really interesting philosophy about how the human race should conduct itself . Now , he was doing something in a secret lab for 3 months , doing something with Bob , and Bob can 't fucking remember anything about it ! Doesn 't that just bug the shit out of you ? - I 'll make some calls . - Thank you . CDC called . They want to know if we need them on this hepatitis outbreak . What hepatitis outbreak ? Weston Field . Mayko ! Get Carlos and Rachel . Conference room in 5 minutes . And this is as of 9 AM this morning . - How many are we talking about ? - 22 dead . - All from liver failure ? - Yeah . 40 patients were administered to emergency hospitals with severe hepatitis symptoms : fatigue , mental disorientation , jaundice . All with acute Hepatitis C. People walk in sick and within days , their liver gives out . And we can confirm everyone 's an intravenous drug user . I thought the city had a needle exchange program ? They do , but a clean needle isn 't exactly a priority with most addicts . Okay , so ... did an existing Hep C suddenly go into overdrive or are we dealing with something we 've never seen before ? Maybe that 's a question for Dr. Cove over at the Toronto Division of Health . After you . Looks like they have a well-equipped lab . Culture hood , bioreactor-wow . That 's not what I 'm talking about . Excuse me . Hi , I 'm David . Megan . Can I help you ? Oh , hi . How are you ? Good , good . My colleague , Dr. Sandström . You 're looking for Dr. Cove . I 'm not sure he 's here . His station 's over there . Megan , you work at the Division of Health long ? A year and a half . Got a favourite virus ? I 'm kind of playing the field right now . Megan , we 've got 3 reported deaths at the West side shelter . - We need to get over there . - Right away . Excuse me . They 've got you on the run these days . Up to 25 dead in the last week . What brings you here ? David Sandström , chief scientist at NorBAC . Looks like we 're sticking our nose into this . I 'm glad to have you on board , Doctor , because after 20 years of being a specialist in hepatitis , I 've never seen anything like this . You mind if we get up to speed , see what you 've got ? What I 've got is an unidentified Hep C strain . Very little luck with treatments . And now 26 dead . Megan , I want you to gather all our data for these folks . I 'll do this myself . - Hate to be rude , but ... - No . Thank you for your time . He always this hands-on ? I 'd call it more of an obsession . I guess his daughter died from using a dirty needle . I 'm not exactly sure , it was before I got here . Since then he 's been personally responsible for tripling the number of needle exchange sites . And got the city to increase blood tests for HIV , HCV ... Wow ... working on that cure in his spare time , I bet . I wouldn 't be surprised . This is my email . Do you mind sending me those files ? - Sure . - Great . Oh ... Mimi . - It 's Megan . - No , Mimi . Biggest virus known to man . Call me sometime , I 'll show you pictures . So sorry . Gee ... Whoever you are , I love you . Whoever you are ? - What are you still doing here ? - I was going to ask the same question . I 'm trying to sort through this data from Public Health . - Anything useful ? - No , not really . Wanna go get a cup of coffee ? I think I might be wired enough . So what 's the plan , then ? Oh , that feels good . The plan is ... that Mayko is coordinating with the University of Washington and Rockefeller ... And ... So the first thing we have to figure out is ... That 's so nice . What strain it is ... and where it 's from . Oh , Mr. Field , what nice hands you have . If I leave now , everything we 've done ... It 's just too soon . If we wait ... one more week ... it 'll all be over . I know it will ... I promise . Bob ? You alright ? I was in bed . Yeah . - With a woman . - No shit ? This is good , Bob . Means you 're remembering stuff . Who was she ? When did you start that again ? I don 't know , like 3 months ago . I was ... I was sitting in this chair , when Roth came in . I wanted to go with him . He cared ... so much . About what ? What did he care so much about , Bob ? He didn 't care about the consequences of having an unregulated lab , or clinical trials . He was behind the cyanobacteria , he was behind the magnetobacteria , he was behind the artificial smallpox . Now think . What does he care so much about ? Because he brought us to the brink . He 's not a scientist . He trusted the people around him . What about the surgery on your brain ? Was that a dead end or was it a new beginning ? Think , Bob ! What did Olivier Roth care about so much ? There 's something about what I 've done , where I 've been ... I just don 't know , David . I just don 't know . Okay , okay . I 'm sorry . I gotta tell you , as long as it stays locked up inside you , it scares the shit out of me . It scares me too , David . Thank you , David . - The levels must be off the chart . - Doubled overnight . Dr. Cove . Rachel . - Dr. Sandström . - Looks like you 've got a full house . We 've got 75 patients with acute Hep C. I need beds . We 're calling other hospitals , but they 're just as crowded . - How many do you normally see a week ? - Hardly any . Acute Hep C is common in developing countries , but this is unusual . It 's rapidly progressing into gastrointestinal haemorrhaging . - Hepatic encephalopathy ? - That 's within days of first symptoms . Excuse me . Anything working ? No . Glenn . - What happened ? - Remember how he said he had stopped ? That he was clean ? - I wish they 'd just say the truth . - I swear to you . Haven 't shot nothin ' , Rachel . - I swear . - Yeah , I know . I believe you , Glenn . Are you convinced this is being spread by dirty needles ? It 's the most likely possibility . We only find this in the IDU community . Can you give me a hand ? Excuse me . - He was fine last time I saw him . - When ? Last weekend . Hep C doesn 't do this to you that fast . Maybe we 're not dealing with Hep C. I ran a detailed PCR analysis on the blood of one of the Hep C patients . - I cannot figure this out . - Neither can I. What do you mean ? The ELISA confirmed that it 's HCV ? All the patients are acutely infected with the same virus , but I just ... I don 't get the strain . It seems to be a genetic mixture of 4 different strains of HCV . Which ones ? 1a , predominantly found in North America . 5 , from South Africa . 4 , from Asia . And 3b ... pretty much worldwide . Worldwide . Okay . Any way these four strains could ... - recombine naturally ? - Not likely . - Implausible , David . - But not impossible , right ? Come on . Let 's say we 've got a guy , right ? He 's already infected with HCV 3b . He just scored with his buddy , who 's got 1a , which is the Hep C of choice in drug users . - That 's what we 're finding , yes . - Okay . Now our guy decides to take a little trip . Goes to ... Shanghai . No . He goes to Cairo . Egypt has one of the highest rates of infection for HCV in the world . That 's where he meets Cleopatra . Bada bing , bada boom , yippee-ki-yay , not knowing that Cleo is percolating HCV4 she picked up from , I don 't know , a sex tourist . Okay ? Now our guy goes to South Africa . One day , he 's minding his own business , he gets mugged . Yes , sir-ee . Now he 's got all four strains mixing it up inside him . What does he do ? Flies home to Toronto , shares his trip with his closest friends , and we 're off to the races . What ? Well , I think you should save that for your next work of fiction . Think of the odds , David : the chances of being ... infected with one of the strains is low to begin with , but the chances of being co-infected by all the strains is insanely remote . Maybe one in ten million . - Well ... - And then all the strains would have to infect a single cell in order to re-arrange . Another one in ten million chance . So for this perfect storm , do the math . - Not if I don 't have to . - That 's a one in sextillion chance . 21 zeroes . One trillion times the number of people on Earth . Okay , you 've spent way too much time with Bob . In other words , this is way beyond a natural fluke . So what are you saying , that it 's man-made ? Engineered ? No , to engineer something you need to have a model to look at . There 's a lot about this virus that 's familiar , but there 's too many strange mutations for it to have been made in a lab . Alright , so what happened ? Unless ... Unless we 're both right . So it 's natural and engineered ? Yeah . What if ... What if ... Okay . You got four mice ... Genetically manipulated to have human liver cells . Exactly . And you infect each of these mice with the 4 Hep C strains that we 're talking about here . A different strain in each mouse . Now the virus can replicate itself naturally . Cove said no drugs would work , so maybe we 're also treating these mice with , like , killing amounts of interferon and ribavirin . Do that and all the drug-resistant strains of the HCV - will begin to emerge ... - Naturally . Now you extract each of the resistant strains out of each of the mice , you purify them , and all together we can use them to infect cells into a single comfy cozy cultured dish . We 'll even throw in a little more interferon for good measure . Eventually , what we extract from the cells could be a genetic recombination of the four Hep C strains , completely drug-resistant and that is how you could have a multi-strained , naturally-engineered , drug-resistant , highly virulent form of HCV . How does it get into the IV drug community ? A lab is trying to figure out how viruses recombine - and accidentally releases it . - But how ? A lab tech accidentally gets infected and then he somehow passes it on to a member of the drug-using community . How are we going to find out ? We have 5 more dead and 23 new confirmed cases . Mayko ... find every lab that has ordered humanized mice . Cross-reference that with hepatologists . Maybe that 's how we 'll find our little odds-defying accident . Rachel , you okay ? Yeah . Oh , shit ! Bob ? Hello , David . How is it you can smell the emotions of all the people around you but you can 't smell a pot of burning chili on the stove ? I was distracted . - Sorry . - Yeah . We 'll order take-out . You 're frustrated . What happened ? I 've had better days . This hepatitis outbreak is turning into an epidemic . I can help . Yeah . Couple more days and I 'll haul your ass back to the lab . We really need you there . Thank you . Anything else come back to you today ? I was with someone ... Roth ? That same woman . Okay . Focus on her face . Does she have a name ? Okay . Okay , Bob . It 's okay . Look , I was talking to this shrink that I used to date . She says that ... drawing from the imagination is really just drawing from memory . Leonardo da Vinci said " You cannot draw what you cannot see " . But you 've seen everything , Bob . You just can 't get your memories to that part of your brain that can access them . So what do you want me to do ? Draw whatever comes to mind . A piece of this , a chunk of that . Maybe we can put it all together and make some sense of it . Thank you , David . We 're going to get it all back , Bob . Everything . I 'll try . Okay , there are 2 distributors of the mouse strain that you use to make humanized mice . There are 235 biopharmaceutical companies , universities , and research facilities using them . I eliminated all the labs that weren 't working on Hepatitis C and brought it home . - Sorry I 'm late . - Oh ! Here . Let me see that list . If you want to produce a Hep C virus in your lab , what would you need ? If they did the natural selection in cell culture , plenty of HUH-7.5 cells . A culture hood , roller bottle and a bioreactor ... Wes ? Got it . Good work , Mayko . I 'm gonna hang on to this . When he 's available for comment , I will let you know . Global News . They 'd like some details on the epidemic . It 's going very well , thank you . We 're very pleased . First reports came back from the university , Toronto Hospital , Nome Biotech ... All clean . Absolutely no sign of any Hep C strains . What about the other labs ? We 're checking the Department of Health lab now . - The Division of Medicine 's too busy . - Get in there and get them tested . By the end of the day . Which leaves us waiting for the next junkie to take a dirt nap . We don 't know who made this strain , let 's try to find how it 's spreading . Back to our hypothetical lab tech . He creates an HCV super strain . What he doesn 't count on is accidentally getting infected . Goes home and shares whatever ... his girlfriend 's toothbrush , or , I don 't know , maybe they have sex . Maybe he 's a closet junkie . But you 'd think if he was smart enough to create a super strain ... - Why would he bother sharing needles . - Yeah . The point is , he accidentally introduces this into the IDU community . It doesn 't fit the pattern , though , because the outbreak seemed to explode simultaneously from multiple locations . Yeah . Shit . We 're asking the wrong question . The lab tech ... why the fuck would he make this shit in the first place ? Trying to create a vaccine ? Create a vaccine for something that would be , as you were all so keen to point out to me the other day , a natural impossibility ? You don 't think it 's an accident . Only thing that fits . Why would anybody bother targeting junkies ? Whatever the reason , if you wanted to target the IDU community , - what would be the best way ? - It would take only one tainted needle . But the virus popped up all over the place . - Five tainted needles . - You know what , I doubt it . Why ? Because Glenn , at the shelter , he died from this outbreak - and he never shared needles . - How do you know ? Because he told me and I believed him . If tainted needles were distributed , they 'd be gone by now , tossed out . Yeah , and the rate of infection sure says the source is still active . Which just means that if the source is tainted needles , somebody 's still giving them out . - Like , for free . - Exchange clinics . And who supplies the needles to the exchange clinics ? Megan . - Hello ! - Hi . Megan , I 'd like you to meet my wingman , Wes . Wes , Megan . Yes , we 've met . - Megan , I 've got a favour to ask you . - Shoot . We need samples of all the syringes that you sent to the exchange clinics . Samples ? Why , what 's going on ? We 're not really sure . We 're just going on a hunch . You 're the one who accesses the syringes , right ? That 's sort of a formal way of saying I pull boxes out of a closet . But sure , I 'm the one that " accesses " the syringes . - And then what do you do with them ? - I don 't know what you 're asking . The boxes are shipped directly here from the manufacturer ? Right , and then I sign for them and distribute them to the various needle exchange programs around the city ... Could we get a look at one of those boxes ? Sure . We 're really just a clearinghouse for all the distribution centers . This is a box of 100 . That 's how they come in and that 's how I ship them out . And these boxes are never opened here ? No reason to . We need to take a couple of these boxes . Run some tests . On sterile syringes ? Well , that 's an assumption and a conclusion we hope to come to . Sure . I 'll be right back . - What do you mean they 're all clean ? - Every one of them . It was a good hunch , just not the right one . Unless of course we picked up the wrong boxes ... Alright . We 're going to get every needle from every needle exchange location - and we 're gonna start all over again . - Excuse me . - Rachel . Could I speak to you ? - We 're kind of busy right now , Wes . It 's important . Mayko , I want you to get down to Public Health , get your hands on every box of needles you can find . Carlos , you do the needle exchange centers . Do it ! Now ! Alright , what 's so important , Wes ? I get my blood tested every 3 months . Why ? I 'm HIV-positive . Alright . So what , are you progressing ? No . Then what 's the problem ? I 've got Hepatitis C. I 've been infected . I 'm proof that the needles from the Division of Health are tainted . Look , everybody just slow down . You shooting up ? Okay , alright . I don 't even go out in the rain because of my HIV . Sex ? I 've only had sex with one person in the last year and I wear a condom . - Are you sharing food ? Drink ? - No . - Toothpaste ? - It 's the fucking needle . If it was the fucking needle , Wes , you 'd be dead by now . Maybe the cocktail of drugs I 'm on for the HIV has slowed its progress . - Oh , Jesus ... - What ? That 's the wrong needles . You were stuck with a blood collection needle . What ? One of the IDUs didn 't want to get his blood tested and I got caught in the struggle . That 's it . And it 's fucking brilliant , because if you are targeting IV drug users , anyone would check the needles , but no one would suspect you tainted the collection kits . Wes , you ... you better tell your partners that they 're at risk of having HCV . Yeah . Oh , shit ... Bob ... I want you to come with me . Let 's go together . These are from the hypo factory , all part of a shipment of test kits to Toronto Division of Health , and they all tested clean . Well , it definitively looks like somebody tried to reseal these . I just got a positive from the Division of Health 's blood collecting needles . I think it 's time we did a little fishing . Make sure you get a sample of the culture hood . - You found something here ? - Dr. Cove . - In my lab ? - Yeah . Not yet . We 're still taking samples . But we did find a whole bunch of shit in the needles your office ordered for use in their blood collection kits . - So , what do you think ? Someone ... - No , we know . We proved it . Someone from my office ? - Why ? - What have you got ? Like , 10 or 15 people working out of this lab ? - 17 . - Right . This is a pretty high-tech piece of equipment you got here . You use this often ? No , not often . You know what , get a sample from the bioreactor too . Why would you use a Mercedes to make huge amounts of mammalian cells ? - Isn 't that overkill ? - As I just said , we don 't use it often . Right . How come a man in your position still works in the field ? I 'm a hands-on scientist , just like you . Here 's what I 'm thinking . I think somebody in this lab put the Hep C super strain in these collection needles . I don 't know why . Maybe they 'd had enough of drug users , maybe they just wanted to ... clean up the streets . I gotta admit it was really smart , making it look like a natural outbreak . I 'm going to assume that these ... insinuations are directed at me . If you 'll excuse me , Doctor , I have a lot of work to do . So do we . Do you have a warrant to be here ? Somebody in this lab murdered 35 people and hung a death sentence around hundreds of others . I am asking you to leave . It 's you . Jesus , you did it , didn 't you ? I don 't deny that every time a fucking user puts a needle in their arm they 're pounding another nail in their coffin . Is that what you wanna hear ? I am gonna check every inch of this fucking lab , and if I find any RNA that matches the HCV that you put out there ... Of course you 're going to find the HCV RNA here . We work with it in every part of the lab . - What is that going to prove ? - How many needles did you taint ? - Hundreds ? Thousands ? - Get out of my lab . Come on . You 're wasting your time . We 'll be back . Count on it . Let 's go , guys . Wes . I went in there on a fishing trip , I came out with a goddamn trophy . It was Cove . He put the HCV in the needles . - How are we going to prove it ? - No idea , but his lab 's a crime scene , ask the cops to close it . Nobody goes in , nothing comes out . Do it now , Wes . Your blood work came back . It 's the Hep C super strain . How long have I got ? I 'm sorry , Wes . There 's an unusually high incidence of brain inflammation in Michigan . 11 people on the verge of death . Why my dad ? He was healthy . The local doctor thinks it 's progressive multifocal - leukoencepha ... - Encephalopathy ? - Contagious PML ? - That 's not possible . Now you know why we called you . I 'm experiencing strange memories . Roth 's lab , except it 's deserted . The woman I was thinking about ... I looked out across the street and saw her ... So beautiful . I don 't wanna die , Rachel . What about the Amsterdam treatment ? They hope to start human trials in 18 months . Wes doesn 't have 18 days .

 I have a friend who is in a persistent vegetative state . He 's 18 now . Had a stroke while he was running . I would bet my last pound that some of those people can hear and understand . See , that 's what I think . I think he 's closer to the surface than we thought . Do you really believe Glenn could wake up ? One step at a time . Shit ! I think the South Korean stem cell line is producing a retrovirus . What ? Okay , what kind of virus are we talking about ? Don 't know . Could give you the sniffles , could be the next AIDS . Owen , what are you doing down here , man ? Well , seeing as how I live here , I guess it 's home . Listen Owen , we think it 's the weed that 's making people sick . Dude , I can 't get rid of it , it 's not mine . It 's the people or the pot , Owen . Salvador Charringa has over 10,000 acres of citrus groves outside Miami . This is what 1,500 of those acres look like as of last week . What are we talking about ? Agricultural terrorism ? According to some experts , Florida could be on the verge of a plague of biblical proportions . We 'd like to know if it 's God 's will or Fidel 's . We sexually neutered the insect . And it was not able to reproduce on the island for over 15 years . We have either been set up , or we 've been lied to since we got off the airplane because everything matches to the Florida strain . Every goddamn thing ! It 's every excuse the Americans need to turn Cuba into a parking lot . Hey . So we found dead leafhoppers and flasks of live bacteria . And the bacteria looks like it matches the strain that came out of Florida . So it 's true . Maybe . Or maybe it 's too convenient . Carlos and I are flying home in an hour to do a detailed comparison between the stuff we found here and the stuff we got out of Charringa 's orange grove . David , FYI , Homeland Security insists they meet your plane in Toronto and take the samples back to Fort Egan . Whoa , whoa ... No , we still got 24 hours . US wants to do their own due diligence . Fuck that shit ! I thought the whole point was to get a disinterested party to investigate ! It 's the only way to persuade some Congressmen , David . It 's politics . It supposed to be science . You tell the Americans no deal . I mean , unless they want to meet me down here in Havana , we 'll do it together . - With the Cubans . - Don 't tempt them . The Nimitz carrier strike group is outside Cuban territorial waters . Take the next flight , David . Goddamn courier service . Bad news . - What ? - Our flight just got cancelled . 2.07 - Talk to him - Yeah . - Hey . Carlos ! Hey , did you get my cigars yet ? Funny you should ask , I 'm sending them by air express . Okay ... really ? These are very special , Mayko . And please do not share them with anyone . - What ? - Eva was telling me , there 's a Cuban tradition that if you find one with a band upside down , then you win a free box . So David and I are very anxious to hear if you get lucky . Uh ... How are things going down there ? Good , good . Just something unusual . The fastidiosa seems resistant to chloramphenicol . The equipment here is going to take us too long to find out if it 's been engineered . Huh ... Not like our equipment . That 's it , Mayko . Got it . And , Carlos , thanks again for the cigars . - Okay , see you soon . - Bye . - Hey . - Hey . So , rumour has it your old high school boyfriend is in town ... And you 're hooking up in David 's apartment ? Really ? And where do these rumours come from , I wonder ? I overheard you on the phone . - So are you excited ? - Ah ... No . The only thing that 's on my mind right now is isolating the retrovirus that is swimming around in my Korean stem cell line . You 'll do it . Well , if you smell something gross in virology , it 's me decomposing , dead from the tedium . Ha ! It 's that bad , huh ? Oh man , I 've checked it . I 've rechecked it . I 've checked it in another lab . I 've checked another sample . I 've checked my ingredients . I don 't ... You know , maybe you should share the info . See what others find . Hold myself up to public ridicule , you mean ? I think the word is " scrutiny " . I don 't know , I mean , you 're talking about a possible treatment for juvenile diabetes . I know . I guess I should send it out there , huh ? Do you want me to do it ? Yeah . Okay . Thanks , Mayko . OK , one , we have a leafhopper from Cuba and a leafhopper from Florida . - Enrico , are those the same species ? - David , I told you , they could not be from here . We eradicated our leafhoppers . Now you can prove it . Two . We are going to prove 100 % that what we are dealing with here is exactly the same bacterium as the one in Florida . Carlos and I will do the RFLP test . - So , now we wait . - Right . Enrico , you got anything ? The specimen from Florida and the one you found in Cuba are the same species . Homalodisca coagulata . - The Glassy-winged sharpshooter . Shit . - Yo no comprendo . I don 't understand , we eradicated it . We have UN documentation . What 's your best guess on where it came from ? Well , it is a highly dispersive insect ... and with all the Caribbean storms of the last few years , es possible , it could come back . Still , American agents could have planted it . Or Cuban agents could have gone to Miami and collected some samples for later dispersion , right ? So let 's just focus on what we know : the insect vector has shown up- - - Conveniently ... - ... in Cuba . Conveniently , yes . Convenient if you want a war . They have all the evidence . The insect and the bacterium . Sandstrom won 't bring them back . I know that , Sir . Okay , Glenn , I 'm going to ask you some easy questions , and then , I 'm going to give you a choice of answering " yes " or " no " . Okay , and when you hear the answer that you want , I want you to imagine picking up a glass of water . Or reaching for it . Moving your hand . Why his hand ? Because we want him to activate two totally different parts of his brain . We don 't want to mistake a language-based response with a language-based stimulation . When he listens to your question , of his brain , here , should fire away . And when he attempts to respond , the motor center , this part here , that should fire . - I see . - Okay . So , um ... Yes / no questions that you can verify as correct or incorrect . Okay . Please try to answer . Um , did you ever have a cat ? Yes ? No ? Is that correct ? No cat ? Yeah . He wanted one . But , my sister was allergic . Ask him some more . Do you like horror movies ? Yes ... Incredible ! - He likes a good scare , does he ? - Yeah ! All right , Caroline , ask him some more questions and give him choices , but not yes or no . Okay . Glenn , you 're doing great . What street did you grow up on ? Was it Spadina Road ? Bloor Street ? Grey River Trail ? Awesome ! Poor guy hasn 't used his brain in , what , nearly two years . He 's gonna be exhausted , we should let him rest . Simon , this is amazing . I mean , this is proof that he 's really in there , you know ? Aware and listening . So , where do we go from here ? Well , we take it to the next step . And I have to warn you , Caroline , the next step , if you agree to it , it 's a big one . It 's traumatic . It 's radical . What is it ? Brain surgery . And brain surgery is never easy on the patient or the patient 's family . Yeah , I know . What 's the procedure ? Ah ... Well , electrodes would be dropped down into his subthalamic nucleus and his globus pallidus interna . Like they 're doing for Parkinson 's patients ? Right , exactly . Yeah , like I said , radical ... but feasible . And how will that help him , exactly ? Well , it 'll stimulate the disconnected systems in his brain - thank you - and get them working together again . And the risks ? Yeah , there are risks with surgery , as you know , risks of something going wrong , risks of infection . The biggest downside is that once ... the implants are in , we can 't image him . We can 't do an MRI ? Not once the electrodes are in place , no . Well if you can 't do an MRI or ask him to respond , how are we going to know it 's working ? Well , he 'll ... He 'll emerge . You 're divorced ? Yeah . Yeah , for over a year now . Oh , I 'm sorry . I didn 't know . No , much better for it . So how about you , you were always into science and stuff . Yeah . I 'm curing Diabetes . - What do you mean ? - Well ... There are these amazing little things called stem cells . - Yeah , I 've heard of those . - You 've heard of them ? Stem cells can grow and become any part of the human body . But how do you make them grow ? I figured out a way to combine stem cells from two different sources . Which caused one of the stem cell lines to become insulin-producing pancreatic cells ; and insulin is the thing that diabetics are lacking . So , the next step is to transplant the resulting pancreatic cells into diabetics , hope that they grow , produce insulin , cure the disease . Wow . Yeah , well , it 'll be good when it 's over . It 's all messed up right now . There 's a factor in cell line B , that I need to identify ... So you haven 't been able to identify what ? Well ... It 's like , there 's something magical in one of the stem cell lines that causes it to grow into a pancreas ... but it 's also infected with a virus . So ... I 've got to figure it out before I can publish my findings . What ? What ? Just remembering those eyes . My eyes ? What color are they ? Brown . Would you get the fuck out of my date ? Your date is in my house . Gary 's a really nice guy . Please don 't ruin this for me . Brown . But if you look real closely at them ... They 're hazel . And they have tiny flecks of gold speckled in them . That 's very good . I 'm sorry . I 'm just ... I 'm sorry . Seeing someone ? No . Not really . So , se√±ores ? 10 out of 10 polymorphisms are the identical length . It 's definitely the same bacterium . Sorry , Eva . Let 's see what Mayko found . - Got anything for me ? - So I 've been comparing the genome sequence we have with every other strain of fastidiosa ever analyzed and ... - this looks like a different bug . - Yeah ? Here 's the genome . But it 's bizarre , because look at this gene . The chloramphenicol resistance , it 's not natural . There . A genetic marker was added so someone could track it . - You 're sure ? - Yeah , this is genetically engineered . It 's textbook . And very professional . - Got any more good news ? - Well what do you want to know ? Put everything you 've got on our website and start breaking it down for me , would you ? - 12,000 genes ? Which ones ? - All of them . Go in each direction from the chloramphenicol insert , try to find out what they were doing . Okay , sure . I 'll get back to you as soon as I can . Can you send it to my computer ? Yeah . Holy shit ! What ? Take a look at this . Eva , come here , take a look at this . I was just checking some of the flanking sequences . Look where the chloramphenicol insert is . See what they took out ? The virulence genes are gone ! Yeah . That makes no sense . They replaced the disease causing genes with one to track the bacterium . Then it should be harmless . If the intent behind this was bioterrorism , why would you take out the poison genes and replace them with a genetic fucking flag ? I mean , wouldn 't you want to hide it ? And if the killer genes are gone , why does it still kill ? Obviously we 're missing something . Are we completely wrong on this ? Hang on . Hey . Now what ? Can you trace that marker ? See if it 's patented . Sure . What are you thinking ? Many things . We have sure-fire proof from NorBAC , a team of independent scientists , and they say Cubans are behind this terrorist act , - What the fuck ! - this international terrorism . I am meeting with the Joint Chiefs to reckon my response . I assure you it 'll be fair ... Eva , I have no idea why NorBAC would say that . I had nothing to do with that announcement . Why didn 't you call me last night ? I just got your message , David . - I 'm as furious as you are . - Who authorized it ? McGuinn ? I told McGuinn your 72 hours weren 't up . Who jumped the gun ? Washington ? I 'm trying to find out . I 've called McGuinn 20 times . Nobody knows where he is . What are you going to tell him ? The only thing I can tell him . What 's that ? - What are you going to tell him ? - I got to go , David . Goodbye . You better have a hell of a good story . Not only good , but true . I called the State Department , said hold your horses , the whole thing is up in the air . Someone , somewhere , somehow got creative . Look , I want you to know I contacted the White House and told them they made an incorrect statement . I RESIGN ! - CAROLINE MORISSON - No . No , no , no , no , no . - What choice do I have ? They 're making us into liars . If you resign , that nut Sandstrom will resign , and NorBAC will be finished . What 's the point of that ? You can 't flush this place down the crapper just because you don 't get your way one time . Morrison , let 's fly down to Washington and sort this all out . I 'm on your side . Caroline . The news on you is all sunny . Brains , guts , presence . Anything 's possible . Congress . Senate . Who knows ? Don 't shoot that pretty foot over some idiot making a wrong announcement . What if it did come from the top ? Like I said : Some idiot . You 'll stay to fight another day ? Caroline ! Only if you make it right over Cuba . - I 'll do it . - Yeah , we 'll see . - David , we got something . - What ? This gene . We just blasted it on the NCBI database . Yeah , it 's another killer gene , and it 's probably the cause of the new virulence . Except this gene has never been seen before in fastidiosa . So we 're looking around trying to find where it came from . Guess what we came up with ? " Xanthomonas " . What the hell is that ? - Citrus Canker . - Native to Florida . The Americans got rid of the virulence genes in the fastidiosa just to add other different virulence genes from the canker ? Let 's call the source . According to Mayko ... the patent holder of the marker gene is a Jonathan Barker , UCLA . At the very least , I 'm sure he 'd like to hear that his invention is being used in agricultural bioterrorism . Hello ? - Jonathan Barker ? - Yes . David Sandstrom , NorBAC Labs . I 'm calling you from Cuba . Cuba ? I saw the news this morning . What 's up ? Well , the fastidiosa that we 're dealing with down here seems to be a strain that you engineered using your marker gene . OK ? You cut out all the virulent genes from your bacterium , is that correct ? - Yeah , that 's right . - Well , it 's been re-engineered . Virulence genes from a citrus canker have been added , making one really virulent bacterium . In the grapes ? I didn 't know they had grapes down there . - Grapes ? - Yeah . This is a grape vaccine ? Against the fastidiosa . We 've been ... That 's what we 've been doing here for the past 3 years . David ? What is it ? David ? An orange grove in Florida , a vineyard in California . That son-of-a-bitch . Charringa infected his own crops . Why ? This will be all over really soon . And then you 'll come back to us . Okay ? Morning , Mayko . Hey . Oh ! Uh ... Bob , Your geologist friend sent some stuff over . For your orchids and atmosphere . This isn 't the Asian brown cloud . This is Mexico . Oh no . The same inversion that 's killing the orchids in Asia is forming over Mexico . And this is worse . Why ? Well , the cloud is 2 kilometres deep . My colleagues are reporting that there are spikes in the sulfates and the soot . Probably coming out of Mount Popocatepetl . Spikes in industrial pollutants . Dust and pesticides . Temperatures on the ground are rising . And with the weakening cyclonic winds in the jet stream , this cloud could stay over Mexico for months . It isn 't just the orchids in Mexico that are going to die . This needs to be monitored closely . - Mayko ... - Bob , I 'll keep an eye on it . Thank you . I 'll make copies . Okay . - Hey . - Hey . You look exhausted . Do I ? I didn 't sleep last night . Hmm ... The high school guy ? No . - Why not ? - Couldn 't do it . He was the nicest , nicest guy . And ... and I couldn 't do it . And I stayed up all night and thought about why I couldn 't do it . - Anyway ... - Oh ! I got something for you . 26 messages from researchers who 've been using the Korean stem cell line . And ... They are all pretty pissed . No one likes bad news . Actually , no one likes bad science . I beg your pardon ? They 're all questioning your procedures . Oh . Okay . " We 've assayed our South Korean stem cells on 32 occasions and have never found any retrovirus activity and all PCR tests are negative . Suggest you hire skilled technicians . " " NorBAC : Scientists from three countries team up to get it wrong , wrong , wrong . " Hey Jill . I forgot to tell you I called Jay Krauskopf at Apliex Pharmaceuticals . He got a batch of the same stem cell lines on the same day . No contamination . No reverse transcriptase , no DNA or RNA evidence of viral infection . Look , you guys , I 'm not crazy . I 've tested it 5 times . Maybe you should do it again . - Yeah . - And I 'll watch . Watch me like my boss ? Well , what you 're doing is biochemistry , and I am a biochemist . Watch this . Come on , Bob . Here you go , Mayko . Thank you . Do you think they will listen to you ? I 'll make them listen . When all this is over , why don 't you come up for a visit ? It is not easy for me to go . But maybe you can come back with some good news for me . Yeah , sure . David ... I have here a present for the people of America . On how we eradicated the leafhopper in Cuba . Now you can do it too . - This will come in very handy , I 'm sure . - I hope so . And I have a little something for you . Ah ... There 's nothing hidden in these is there ? Only pleasure . Thank you . Goodbye . Have a safe flight , David . Thank you , David . - Carlos ... - Enrico . Goodbye . - Muchas gracias por todo . - De nada . Buon viaje . Yes , I sterilized it . I double-checked it twice . Bob , I learned that in Lab Procedures junior year . - Everything looks standard . - Exactly . - Except the buffer . - Buffer ? Where 'd you get the recipe ? From my post-doc supervisor at Cal Tech . Karl Heinz . He was trained in Heidelberg . It is old-school bomb-proof shit . Yeah . But it contains magnesium and manganese . Right . Well , no one else makes their own solutions anymore . Everybody in the world uses kits . - And the kits use magnesium . - So ? So maybe that 's why nobody else can duplicate your results . OK . OK . So we 'll do another assay comparing buffers with and without manganese . Do it up . You going to watch again ? It went well , Caroline . It 's going to be a little while before he gets out of recovery . You should go home . - Get some rest . - No . No , I can 't ... It 's going to be at least tomorrow before we even try to reach him . - He 's fine ? - Yeah . Yeah . He 's about to start a big adventure . Thank you . Thank you , Simon . There . The pure magnesium buffer . No RT activity . But using manganese-magnesium : Reverse transcriptase ! Outstanding ! Hey , Mayko ! - What ? - I was right . So , you need to send out my buffer specs to all of those labs . Nice . Yeah , so I 'll tell them to use your buffer and they will taste defeat . It still doesn 't solve my big problem , though . The South Korean stem cell line is the only one that provides the right nutrients to keep the pancreatic cells alive . And it is contaminated with a virus . Yeah , you 're right . So , you 're going to have to ID the retrovirus and prove that it 's harmless before your results can go forward . That 's what I 've been trying to do . Or you need to purify whatever is in that cell supernatant that 's responsible for the growth-enhancing properties . That could take months ... maybe years . So much for my triumph . It 's good work , Jill . Thank you , Bob . Excuse me . I need to see Se√±or Charringa . He 's way down there . What are you doing here , McGuinn ? Caroline couldn 't make it . Yeah , I couldn 't get in touch with her . What 's going on ? Personal things . I didn 't know Caroline had a personal thing , let alone more than one . You 'd be surprised . - We need to sort this out , David . - Gee , you think ? Who 's the asshole who ruined NorBAC 's reputation ? - Wasn 't me . - Well who was it ? 'Cause that 's where I 'm going next with a baseball bat . I 'm working on it . So what did you find out ? I 'm working on it . Ah . We meet again , gentlemen ! Welcome to my new venture . - Flowers ! It 's good to see you both . - Good to see you . I 'm growing Brassavola from Brazil . - It 's- - - Nice , okay . Here it is . The fastidiosa bacterium is heading north from Brazil . So you decided to do a pre-emptive vaccination on your Florida groves . Scientist boys in California are already using a genetically engineered version of fastidiosa as a vaccine against the disease in grapes . So you figure , hey , why not citrus , right ? I don 't understand . The California vaccine , picks up some Florida canker bad shit , in this case a virulence gene , suddenly you 've got the bacterium that nearly ate Florida citrus . Because your boys didn 't do their homework , insurance won 't pay for devastation you pretty much brought on yourself . So you point your middle finger at Cuba - get some of your old buddies to plant the bad stuff over there at some lab for us to find . You , yourself , NorBAC , said the Cubans were behind it . Well , technically speaking we didn 't , right , McGuinn ? The White House is releasing a retraction at six . Friday at six ? That 's the burial hour . By Monday morning it 'll be long forgotten . What Dr. Sandstrom says , this is all true ? I was hoping you 'd be able to deny it . Aguilar ! Were you vaccinating the trees ? Did you use a vaccine for the grape on our citrus ? Where did the scientists come from ? California . We were doing this to ourselves . Our word means nothing , we are ruined . Jill ! Jill ! What ? What ? I 've been calling you for so long , I 'm going to go hoarse . And your friend at the desk , he smells like one . What friend ? Some kid says he knows you and David . What ? Thank you . - Owen ? - Hey . I know you . What are you doing here ? Oh , I thought I 'd dig myself out of a New York hole . Is David around ? No . No , sorry . He 'll be back in a couple of days . Okay . I just want to say thanks . You know , because I got out of that shit in New York . Good . That 's good for you . So where are you staying ? Well , I checked out the Ritz downtown and then the Regency , 'cause I heard it had a better spa . - You hungry ? - No , I 'm fine . Do you need a place to crash ? - No , really , I 'm ... - You 're full of shit . OK . I wanted to get out of New York , and you guys were really good to me and I didn 't have anywhere else to go . Yeah . I 'm starving . It 's OK . It 'll be all right . Come on . Here you go . Look , I really need to talk to her , Wes , where is she ? I don 't know , David . She left early this afternoon . - Have you tried her on her cell ? - Of course I tried her on it ! Have they stopped the fucking invasion ? Why would they do that ? Because I explained to McGuinn that the Cubans had nothing to do with it . Well then , I 'm sure he 's advising the proper channels . Oh , you 're sure , are you Wes ? Would it be too much trouble for you to be absolutely fucking certain ? - No . It wouldn 't be too much trouble . - Good . Call me when you find out . David ! Hi . You 're back . I 'm so sorry . - Is everything all right ? - Hi . Hi . Owen ? What are you doing here ? Uh ... Well , you said if ever I was in town I should look you up . No . I said you could call me . No sweat . I 'll go . I know a nice spot for him under the Gardiner Expressway . Don 't you have some relatives you could stay with or ... ? There 's an uncle in Boston I wanted to hook up with but then ... dude disappeared - so ... I was on the road , and I figured ... - that I 'd find you , ' cause I figured . - Bad figuring . 'Cause I figured I did what you said . I got rid of the weed . And now , the 2 guys who owned the weed , well , they want to kill me . - What ? - Who ? Look , I just need a place for a bit . The bottom line is , you need ... you need a better place than this . Like a foster home ? I don 't know why I don 't have these brilliant ideas ? - Alright . It was great to see you . - Okay . Okay . Okay . Owen . Hang on . David . Can I talk to you for a second ? I 'll be outside . David . What ? You 're not just going to kick him out ? Yeah , I am . I don 't do kids well , alright . - Yeah , I know . - So I don 't want him here . But that kid has been pushed aside by everybody . Are you just going to ignore him ? Ignore the problem and hope it goes away ? I just wanted to be alone , right now . With you . Well we can wait . But he can 't . Come on . Go on in there and give the kid a break . He can sleep on the couch . Jill ! Owen ! - Hey . - Hi . I woke up to an empty apartment this morning , what 's going on ? I just had a lot of work to do . What about Owen ? Where 's he ? I don 't know . He was eating toast last time I saw him . Maybe he stepped out for a smoke . Well , maybe he 'll still be smoking when we get home tonight so we can finally , you know , talk about ... I found out that my aparment 's been fixed , so I 'm going home tonight . Oh . All right . Well , you want to have dinner ? I don 't think we 're a good idea right now . Oh . Really . I mean . Good . 'Cause , me neither . And that 's what I wanted to talk about , so ... Good . I 've got to get to work . Yeah , I 've got to work , too . Let 's talk to him . Ask him a question . Glenn , is there anything we can do for you ? A-B - C-D - E-F - G-H-I - J-K-L- - Hold on . L. A-B-C - D-E- - Hold on . E. A-B-C ... You 're doing great Glenn . A-B - C-D ... E- - - Hold . It 's a decision he 's had a lot of time to make . And he was finally able to express it . But do we have to listen ? We don 't have to listen . I mean , it 's up to us ultimately . And we don 't have to do anything . It 's up to you , Caroline . If you decide to discontinue life-sustaining care , well ... - First , they 'd give him a morphine drip . - Why ? Why morphine ? To make him comfortable and relaxed . Then , they 'd remove the endotracheal tube . And , his breathing will slow down . And , it 'll be peaceful . How long until ... ? - Caroline ... - How long , Bob ? A few minutes , maybe . What are you thinking , Caroline ? I 'm thinking , I don 't know if I can do this . I mean , could you ? So , uh ... I 'm going to think about it . I don 't know . Maybe I just need to sit with him for a while and uh . Yeah . Thank you , Bob . We 're running . Glenn , we 're running and ... Feel the leaves under our feet ? See the dappled sunlight ? We 're in a forest . We 're just going , so fast now that the wind is pinching our ears and our eyes are watering and we can 't even feel our cheeks anymore . Look out for the brambles . Jump ! Watch out there 's a low branch . Duck ! That 's a really treacherous run , isn 't it ? But we don 't care . We don 't care because ... Look up ahead , there 's a ... there 's a there 's a meadow . Can you see it ? Evening primrose ... and steeplebush ... just waiting for you ... Now you can run . I heard about Glenn . - Bob , I 'm sorry . - The cloud . Here . We could be heading towards a perfect pollution storm over Mexico City . Homeland Security 's been keeping a close watch on two brothers . Scientists . Vincent and Stefan Manford . The Manford Brothers sent this - to the President of the United States . - Big fans ? Not at all . They 've been very verbal about how much they disliked the way the President has been handling US affairs . Them and 75 % of the rest of the world . We wanted to remind him of the blood of American soldiers who died in Iraq . We wrote that in our note . Did he get our note ? Just test the bottle and then you ... No , we are going to Chicago to take a look at their lab . - Take a look at their lab ? - I have my orders , David . Orders ! Since when did we join the fucking army ? Orders ! Jesus ! This is bullshit ! No more games . I need you online now if we 're going to do this together . Make it your top priority , remember only you know the whole story .

They gonna believe a machine from the future stole his identity and did it ? They gotta believe . This has to end here . Sorry you gotta take the blame for it . It 's not your fault . Just bad luck . You all right ? John , are you all right ? Would you answer me ? Mom ! Can you move ? Are you hurt ? You 're bleeding . I 'm fine . Are you all right ? Just my shoulder . We gotta go . - Can you walk ? - Yeah . Good , ' cause we gotta run . Come back here ! All fire and E.M.T. Personnel advised to stand by . Fire has destroyed a home at 204 laurel avenue . Number of dead or injured is unknown . - These the only two D.O.A. ? - That 's it . - You check the whole house ? - House is clear . What the hell 's going on here ? Where is she ? Hell if I know . Long gone if I know her . Who 's out there under those sheets ? We were doing a deal . Went bad . We stole this . Guess they came back for it . What 's on it ? Oh , records , names , transactions . I don 't know . We thought we could use it to find something we 've been looking for . What are you looking for ? It 's a piece of tech . It 's called the turk . It 's another computer . It 's a program . - What 's it do ? - Right now ? Plays a mean game of chess . Couple years , it 's gonna get really pissed off . Blow up the world . Units requested . Possible stolen vehicle involved in an accident . Suspects fled scene . Injuries unknown . She could be anywhere . That 's right , she could be anywhere . Or she could be right there . Maybe with your chess program . The identification of these two victims has not yet been released . And it is unclear how they are connected to this blaze or to the car explosion nearby . Mr. Walsh ? Ma 'am . Do you have it ? I do , ma 'am . It 's a modest little mouse , if I may say . It 's not much to look at for 300,000 . Better be able to checkmate bobby fischer for th . Not for you to judge , mr . Walsh . It 's the last you 'll hear of it from me . When will I see you ? I thought I 'd tour the sights with it for a bit , ma 'am . Make sure I was clean . That seems prudent . An hour , then . An hour . And mr . Walsh , bobby fischer 's dead . Ma 'am ? Call a meeting of the department heads for tonight . Tonight ? But ms . Weaver , justin tuck is in palm springs for a long weekend . - I 'll get him back . - Thank you . Witness saw a woman and a teenage boy get out of the car and move off to the south . Are they hurt ? Either way , they 're moving . I 'm okay . I 'm okay . It 's just bruised . Let 's go . It could be broken . How 's your leg ? Is your head still bleeding ? We 've gotta get off the street . We need to find a safe place . Has there been an accident ? No ambulancia , no . No doctora , por favor . We need sanctuary . Can I ask for that ? Please ? We need somewhere to hide . Now . Yes . Of course . Come with me . And they should leave . Come on . So what are you gonna do when you find ' em ? - Do ? - Join the team ? Think she 's gonna go with you , or let you take care of her , ' cause it 's not gonna happen . She left you at the altar for a reason . That 's not what I want . Really . Yeah . I 'm married . - So you say . - I love my wife . So you say . Look , I just wanna know they 're okay , got it ? What if they 're not ? Then I 'll make ' em okay . Like I did for you . Your money 'll be deposited in the account within 30 minutes . Please , take all the precautions we discussed . 'Course , ma 'am . So much for so little . Again , don 't mind me sayin ' . They flow from street to street . At a particular speed and in a particular direction . Walk the block , wait for the signal , cross at the light . Over and over . So orderly . All day I can watch them and know with a great deal of certainty what they 'll do at any given moment . But they 're not orderly , are they ? Up close . Any individual . Who knows what they 're gonna do ? Any one of them might dash across the street at the wrong time and get hit by a car . When you get up close , we never follow the rules . You give a computer a series of rules , and it will follow them till those rules are superseded by other rules . Or that computer simply ... wears down and quits . Computers are obedient to a fault . Do you know what 's extremely rare in the world of computers ? Finding one ... that 'll cross against the light . Thank you , mr . Walsh . Be careful out there . Are you all right ? You already asked me that . I 'm asking you again . I 'm fine . I think we need to talk about what happened back at the house . No , I don 'T . Maybe I need to talk about it . Maybe you do , but I don 't , so let 's not . Please . Then we need to talk about her . Whatever happened with the explosion , it 's flipped a switch . She 's reverted or something . She knows everything . I know . - Bank accounts . Contingency plans . Weapons stash . - I know . How we run , where we 'll go . Who we 've been , who we 'll be . She 'S ... stronger and faster . We have to kill her , john . I know ! I know . I just read your incident report . I want to thank you for filling everything out so quickly- - it 's a big help . Of course . So , laszlo- - did you ever think that he had it in him ? Out-of-work actor , a civilian ? I did not , no . But he was here before . Suspect in multiple murders . We cleared him . But you had a change of heart , obviously ? Discovered he was impersonating an fbi agent . Yeah . Yeah , I had a change of heart . Do you have any idea whose bullet was ultimately responsible for taking laszlo out ? No , I don 'T . You know who threw the tear gas into the residence ? No . Do you know who fired into the apartment , igniting the canisters ? No , I do not . It 's amazing you survived . Do you know how you survived ? No . You wanna talk to somebody ? You need help ? You want a counselor ? You want a pastor ? You 're divorced . You have anybody ? I 'll be all right . We want you to take six weeks paid leave , special circumstances . I don 't think that will be necessary . We insist on it . So under possible penalty of perjury , as it relates to case file b1987004 , do you , agent james ellison , today attest that all that you 've recorded and said , case file 's accurate and factual as far as your recollection can warrant ? Yes . I do . Good luck , agent . M.JESUS EL SALVADOR DEL MUNDO Yes ? May I help you ? I 'm looking for my family . Family . My mother and my brother . We were in an accident . I think they 're hurt . There is no one here . I need to find them . It 's life or death . Like I said , there is no one here . I 'm going to look around . It 's life or death . Now . - Two minutes . - I know . What are you doing ? Stay away . Please . I told you to go away . You have to stay away . Go ! 70 seconds . - The knife isn 't sharp enough . - Well , push harder . - How much time ? - 55 Oh , wait , I see it . I see it , I see it . Screwdriver , screwdriver . Oh , it 's not the right size . 20 seconds . Okay , okay . The knife , the knife . Damn it ! We can 't do this . Come on , john . She 's waking up . She 's waking up ! Keys . Mom . Mom ! You have to go . Do it . - John . - What ? Go . Go ! Go ! Call to him . No . Call to him . You 're making this difficult . He won 't come back ! No . He won 'T . John . John ? You can 't do this . You don 't know what you 're about to do . Yes , I do . You were gonna kill me . No , john . You can 't do this . You 're not doing the right thing . This is not the right thing , john . Things are good now . Things are fine now . I ran a test . Things are good now . I 'm fixed now . You can trust me now . Everything 's good now . What are you waiting for ? She doesn 't know , she doesn 'T . I 'm good now . I 'm good , I ran a test . Everything 's perfect . I 'm perfect . John ! I 'm sorry for what I did . I 'm sorry . It wasn 't me . You have to understand . It wasn 't me . That wasn 't me . You can 't let this happen , john . You can 't ! Please , listen to me . Listeno me . I don 't want to go . Please , john , please . John , listen to me . I don 't want to go . Please , john . Please . I 'm good now . Listen to me . I don 't want to go . I 'm sorry . That wasn 't me . I 'm fixed now . I ran a test . Everything 's perfect . You can trust me . John connor . I love you ! I love you , please . I love you , john , and you love me . We should get going soon . You guys cut a pretty serious path of destruction across the city . Wasn 't us . I 'm sorry . Shoulda called earlier- - maybe we could 've helped you avoid some of those . I doubt it . How 's this ? It looks trashed . So I 'm guessing that sarkissian didn 't tell you where he sold the turk before you killed him . Wasn 't that kind of conversation . did he see it all ? He saw it all . Damn . So charlie told me that cromartie killed about 20 fbi guys today . He 's still out there . He 's here for me . They 're dead because of me . They 're dead because some people refuse to accept the reality of the situation . Which is what ? Which is that they carry death with them . She was different . I made her . I sent her back . - She 's different . - She 's not different . There 's physical damage to her chip . - Which means that she can be repaired- - - john . I need her . She saved my life . She saves my life ! I know what you saw today . I know what you did , and I 'M ... so proud of you . Maybe you could fix her . I know you want to try . But I can 't let you . I just--I can 'T . So burn her . Let 's get the hell out of here . What she said back there ... everything she said , it was a trick . You know that , right ? They don 't feel anything . They don 't have feelings . They don 't know love . I know that , mom . you know , I saw her do this with the last one . The only way to be sure . Especially this one . John , chip . The flare . Where is it ? - Sarah ? - Yeah . I 'm sorry . john- - john . Don 't do this . - John , don 't do this ! - Back off ! John , she 'll kill you . There 's only one way to find out . Are you here to kill me , john ? Are you here to kill me ? No . Promise . SUBJECT IDENTIFIED : JOHN CONNOR TERMINAT TERMINATION OVERRIDE Promise . I 'll never lead you to her . So if that 's why you left me alive , you might as well kill me right now . I 'll never do the devil 's work . We 'll see . Thank you for joining me tonight . I 'm pleased to announce the formation of a new division . It 'll cross disciplines , draw from many areas of expertise , and require the highest level of work from each of your groups . Each of our groups ? How 's that ? Won 't you be hiring- - I 'll be taking team members from each division and creating a new team . With all due respect , and I can only speak on behalf of the A.I.Division when I tell you that I haven 't a man to spare . Your division will be hard-hit . A list of new team members will be on your desks after you leave this meeting . The name of the new group is babylon . It 's from the bible . And what does babylon do ? I mean , besides steal our team members . Mr. Tuck , it 's going to change the world . I got what I could . Some smoke and water damage , but at least you don 't have to start completely over . It wouldn 't be the first time . Thanks . There 's one too many . Charley took off . He said to say bye . Guess he really does have a wife . Have you seen john ? I think he 's using the shower . Do you believe in the resurrection ? What ? The story of jesus christ . The resurrection . Do you believe in it ? Would you if you 'd seen what I 've seen ? Faith isn 't part of my programming . Yeah , well , I 'm not sure it 's part of mine either . Don 't let him do that again . If I ever go bad again ... don 't let him bring me back . yeah ? I made you a sandwich and brought you some clothes . I 'll be out soon . John , I need you to know everything that happened today . Everything we did . It was all ... it just happened the way it did . And there 's nothing we can do to change it . Whatever happened , we 're alive , okay ? We 're alive . I know you need more from me today , but ... it 's gonna have to be enough . Can you hear me ? Are you listening ? Yeah , I 'm listening . Happy birthday . That was something , wasn 't it ? Wonder what she 's got planned . Eh , who knows what goes on in that brain of hers ? I don 't know understand what the hell she 's talking about half the time anyway . Zen koans and bible quotes . It 's all a bunch of bull . Well , our options have tripled since she took over , so I wouldn 't bite the hand if I were you . Well , that 's easy for you to say . She 's not cannibalizing your division for some top secret torah study . Okay . God , that bitch pisses me off . Sorry I piss you off , mr . Tuck . The feeling 's mutual .

 Now for the next scene . use your magic and attack Mikuru-chan ! the answer is NO ! I won 't allow anyone to harm Asahina-san ! Just look at her ! Can 't you see she 's already pale and shaking ? Whatever . We 'll use VFX for this scene . make rays or something come out of Yuki 's wand when you edit it . Like I 'd know how to do that sort of visual effect . scream now ! Then fall like you 're in pain ! I think it 's more appropriate here } Huh ? We 're going to a nearby shrine next . We 're going to get shots of Mikuru-chan walking with a bunch of pigeons fluttering in the background . It would be nice if they were all white though ... 434 ) } Please don 't feed the pigeons 460 ) } The Sigh of Suzumiya Haruhi III any color would probably do . Can 't you read Japanese ? What the hell am I filming anyway ? especially since it 's not all that close and she 's not even looking at it - Nazo } Make sure you get that scene now ! { See previous - Nazo } Mikuru-chan ? ! What ? ! Retreat ! you don 't eat enough . You won 't grow right like this . you 'll only get hardcore fans . You need to grow taller too . and removed the ellipses since he 's no really trailing - Nazo } I 'm not sure how many years it will take ... but Asahina-san 's face and body ... will eventually develop to Miss Universe levels . Although she doesn 't yet know this herself ... Haruhi . { Period should be fine - Nazo } What are you going to do if that priest goes to the school and complains ? Our cover was blown thanks to Koizumi 's uniform . I think it 'll be fine . and that blazer is quite common . we can just feign ignorance . I 'm pretty sure they 'd know the instant we showed them the footage . surrounded by pigeons . where are we going next ? Let 's go back to the field at the park again . that didn 't make a good battle at all . { No need for ellipses - Nazo } with Yuki hot on her trail ... rushes to save her ! How about that scene ? That 's one random scene . so she may well be seriously considering throwing Asahina-san off a cliff . why don 't YOU fall instead ? You put on that costume and be her stunt double ! though ... " - Nazo } Are you imagining silly things again ? since " make out " tends to refer more to trying to focus on something that can 't be seen clearly - Nazo } Mind reader ! Are the three of us the only characters in the story ? Idiot ! Don 't ask unnecessary things ! That 's true ... { Changed from " right " and added ellipses since she 's agreeing / admitting it - Nazo } Three might be too few . Koizumi-kun ! I 'll increase your screen time ! That 's ... Thank you . Serves you right . so I didn 't say anything . right ? minions ... right ? That would be perfect ! Taniguchi and Kunikida . They play an even smaller role than that of minor characters : the minions of the minions . I want Mikuru-chan to go through hell . { Removed ellipses - Nazo } A poor girl who has to face all sorts of problems and finally lives happily ever after in the end . That 's this movie 's theme ! rather than the audience experiencing catharsis - Nazo } What was that ? Are you trying to say I don 't look like I 'll be of any help ? We once again arrived at the park in the forest . I think we 'll drop the guns . and changed " was no flash " to " were no flashes " - Nazo } There was no excitement in it at all . Mikuru-chan stands here . Yuki here . Okay ... Don 't leave your spots . I want to film you two staring at each other as if you 're ready to duel . prepare the reflector board . Action ! What ? ! What do you mean " action ? " you told them to do nothing but stand there ! What kind of " action " do you want them to do ? { Added quotes - Nazo } that 's so not a furious battle ! That 's because they 're just standing there ... Mikuru-chan . you can 't just relax like that ! There are plenty of cute girls everywhere ! all the younger girls will sneak up from below and surpass you ! What are you trying to say ? this is why you need to fire a beam from your eye or something ! That 's impossible ! That 's why your left eye is a different color ! It 's not blue for nothing ! There 's an amazing power hidden inside of it ! And that power is a beam ! Mikuru Beam ! You need to fire that ! I don 't have one ! Just fire it ! That hurts ! That idiot ! { " This " vs. " That " ... - Nazo } Stop it ! What do you think you 're doing ? I can 't figure you out . Let go of me ! You 're hopeless ! Do you think humans can actually shoot beams in real life ? { orig line : Do you think real humans can actually shoot beams ? | As opposed to " fake " humans ? - Nazo } Are you that stupid ? Of course I know they can 't . I 'm just telling her that she should act as if she were firing a beam . She doesn 't have the aura of a main character at all . You 're a dork who doesn 't get jokes . It 's because your jokes have that troublesome tendency of coming true . { changed " to come " to " of coming " - Nazo } What would you do if Asahina-san really could fire beams ? right ? After we film that scene right ? Thank you . And who 's going to do that ? that was what I intended to do from the beginning ! That shot was a no-go . We 're re-doing it ! You need to yell " Mikuru Beam ! " and pose like this . Like this ? like this ! And close your right eye . try it ! Mi-Mi-Mikuru Beam ... Say it louder ! Mikuru Beam ! Don 't be shy . Just say it ! Mi-Mi ... Mikuru Beeeeam ! Yell from your abdomen ! The stares of the families around us are starting to become painful . let 's try it for real . Now ! The beam ! Mi-Mi-Mikuru Beam ! since when were you standing there ? Cut ! Cut ! Yuki ! What are you doing ? ! What are you doing ? This isn 't in the script ! Nagato ! Are you okay ? Eh ? what were the two of you doing ? Could you not do things that aren 't in the script ? Huh ? What happened to your contact lens ? Huh ? we need to ask the one who knows what 's going on . do you know where Asahina-san 's colored contact went ? No . Lies ! Did it fall while you two were struggling ? Why isn 't it around here ? pretend to look too ! The wind might have blown it away . after all . What happened ? Did it break ? eh ? coming from our photography club . try to stick it back together with tape . Understood . We can 't continue the scene without the colored contact . What should we do ? That 's it ! We 'll make it so her eye changes color after her transformation ! T-Transformation ? That 's right ! You 'd never wear this kind of costume in the real world anyway ! It 's more strange that you 're looking for reality in a fictional world . That 's a good idea . I 'd like to wear something more appropriate . Mikuru-chan 's casual wear will be a bunny girl suit ! Wh-Wh-Why ? ! Because that 's all I brought with me . the scene won 't be flashy at all . Wait ! I just came up with the setting . Mikuru-chan 's normal form is the shopping district 's customer-attracting bunny girl ! you immediately transform ! And then you become a combat waitress ! right ? Weren 't you saying something about reality a minute ago ? Let 's get started then ! We thank you for your sacrifice . what was that ad-lib about ? { I think the original original of " ad-lib " works better than " improv " - Nazo } This . So you took it after all . Laser . Nagato ... It 's always bothered me that your explanations don 't even reach an absolute minimum level . Please talk for at least 10 seconds . It 's a directional transparent high-intensity coherent pulse ray . I see . A directional transparent high ... I understand even less now . A laser ? Yes . That 's a shock . Can I take a look ? It looks like an ordinary contact to me . What 's going on ? Could you show me your right palm ? not yours . Nagato-san 's . I failed to properly shield it . Don 't say it so plainly . It 's painful just to look at . It was very powerful . It happened instantly . A laser beam was fired from Asahina-san 's left eye ? Yes . Don 't just say " Yes ! " I 'll regenerate it now . What on Earth ... Did Asahina-san really fire a beam from her eye ? Not accelerated particles . Intensified rays . I don 't care which it is . and atomic heat rays are all pretty much the same thing to an amateur . The problem is that Asahina-san fired a heat ray from her eye . Not a heat ray . Photon laser . I don 't care about the scientific specifics ! Is this an ability that Asahina-san has always had ? No . The present Asahina Mikuru is an ordinary person ... No different from the general populace . Is there some trick to this colored contact ? No . It 's just a decoration . Which means ... would have left the back of my head . This is Suzumiya-san 's doing . so reality changed for her . That 's what happened . Wait a minute . right ? Why does a murderous beam of light get emitted after Haruhi wishes it to ? Suzumiya-san doesn 't need magic or unknown scientific technology . then it exists . right ? That 's true . We know that Suzumiya-san possesses some form of common sense . it 's also true that this world 's " common sense " doesn 't apply to her . I suspect some exceptional phenomenon occurred . That 's ... they 're back . We 'll continue this talk later . How long do you plan to keep whining ? Behave more like an actress ! which is an award given in atheletic events ... - Nazo } Sorry for making you wait . Zoom ... in ! Identity confirmed . This is my Asahina-san . What do you think you 're doing ? Don 't shoot things that I don 't tell you to ! Got it ! I can prove that I didn 't press record . I was just looking . pay attention everyone ! And get ready ! we filmed what was supposed to be Asahina-san 's " everyday life . " What kind of " everyday life " is this ? And after dragging Asahina-san all over the forest ... It just feels off with that mountain in the background . Let 's go into town ! Good grief . Asahina-san continued to play a bunny girl until sunset that day . all we did was walk around the block . It seems Haruhi doesn 't understand the concept of a film permit . anywhere she liked . Her freedom was as unlimited as Pope Innocent III 's power over the Holy Roman Empire apparently . She has the meaning of freedom all wrong . that 's it for today . That was a long day . I want to spend my Sunday tomorrow resting . see you again tomorrow . We 'll meet at the same place and time as today . You heartless slave-driver . right ? What do you mean ? We need to be shooting . This is no time to be relaxing ! can 't you ? don 't you dare put any red marks on your calendar . See you tomorrow then . We 'll definitely make this film a success . No ... success is guaranteed . The rest depends on your efforts . Make sure you 're on time . Anyone who doesn 't show up will be executed and then executed again ! I 'll inform Asahina-san . About what ? The laser from earlier . she won 't fire any strange beams . let 's arrange some insurance . I expect she will help out . after all . But even so ... I 'm constantly having my life saved by Nagato . Kyon ! This isn 't what you told us ! Where 's the beautiful Asahina-san ? We came because you said she 'd pick us up ! But she 's not here ! but what 's this all about ? What are you talking about ? You 're the main character ! This movie relies 30 % on you for success ! All I 've seen today is Haruhi going nuts . but that doesn 't matter ! This is an outrage ! Go eat your outrage and die . Stare at Nagato or something . Nagato-san 's costume really suits her . Kyon-kun ! Where 's Mikuru ? It seems Tsuruya-san was also borrowed as an extra . So what are we doing ? I came because I was told to come if I had the time . What 's that written on the armband Suzumiya-san 's wearing ? What 's with that camera ? Why 's Yuki-chan dressed like that ? Itsuki-kun 's lookin ' good today too ! Busy girl . What ? Your stomach hurts ? Idiot ! Only an elementary school kid would use that excuse ! Come right now ! In 30 seconds ! It seems Asahina-san has been hit with Acute Hikikomori Syndrome . I 'll go pick her up . Give me that bag . Vacant car I understand Asahina-san 's feelings very well . it seems like she 'll become a real transforming heroine at this rate . a laser beam is overdoing it . Although it does appear that we 'll be able to avoid any further laser beam emissions . How ? { " How " is more appropriate than " Why " - Nazo } Nagato-san lent her aid . What did you do to Asahina-san ? She just removed her laser emission ability . I don 't know the details . Nagato-san won 't explain anything . What 's a TFEI ? An acronym we 've taken to using for them . It 's not something you need to know . But I believe ... even amongst her peers . but ... and I came across a taxi . I noticed the taxi sign . { Dropped " that " from " that the " since ... it doesn 't make sense } it said " Love car I 'll bet that was surprising . But it drove off before I could double check . And that 's when I realized ... Isn 't love what I 'm missing right now ? I wonder if it really did say " Love car It was probably a private taxi . To think we have to turn to a young girl and these two idiots ... I 'm not letting you use a fake cold as an excuse ! We 're going to get right to the filming ! Mikuru ! that 's super sexy ! Sorry I 'm late . I don 't really mind . Suzumiya-san ! I 'm sorry about yesterday . It seems I unexpectedly fired an optical weapon ... Don 't worry about it . I 'm fine . I was bitten . By what ? By Nagato-san . It was apparently to inject some nanomachines ... But my eyes won 't fire again so that 's good . What did she inject ? along with Koizumi-kun ... What secrets are you discussing ? you 're so cute ! I want to take you home ! { changed " bring " to " take " . I wonder if it 's a reference to Rena in Higurashi - Nazo } Don 't look . You 'll hog all the good sights . I 've decided on the location ! Apparently there 's a huge pond near Koizumi-kun 's place . So we 'll be shooting there for the time being ! Film Crew Line

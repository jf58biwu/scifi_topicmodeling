Princess ! Yes ? give up on the idea ! There are a number of fellows here I don 't like the look of . This is no place for an heiress to the throne to step foot in . Coming this far won 't hurt . look at that ! Watch out ! Run ! Huh ? What is it ? Bigfoots running amuck ! I knew it ! S-Save us ! wait up ! Hey ! They ran away from us again . will you ? ! Pardon ? Don 't act stupid ! you guys ! Sheesh . They should try putting themselves in our shoes and having to find opponents for them . though ... no ... get over here a sec ! All right ! Come down already ! this needs replacing too ? so go easy ! Dan ? Look who 's talking ! isn 't this your fault ? ! Pardon ? Pardon " my ass ? ! Are you even listening ? ! that 's him Iceman Hotty ! It looks like he 's only passed out . you shall carry him to the trailer . retreat ! Princess ... How many times does this make it ? We 're not here for pro wrestling ! Pardon ? Take that " Pardon " and shove it ! Destroy ! You did it then and then ... Destroy ! ... and then ! You destroy the opponents and it doesn 't even come close to a match ! and then ! Why do you lob them at me too ? ! Don 't mind that . One day you 'll catch up to me . what 're you gonna do about it ? ! Dan . Yeah ? Did I finally get through your thick skull ? Do people dislike you that much ? My ... My legendary right hand wants to wring your neck so bad ! Your luck with men remains awful . It 's okay . I can do it whenever I want . Uh-huh ... uh-huh ... really ? Who is this guy ? It seems like he came over the desert chasing after us . What ? ! Again ? How is he ? No external injuries . He 's just unconscious . I 'm sure he 'll wake up soon . Good ! we 'd have to take responsibility . You 're a worrywart like always . This kid ... I 'm sure I remember him in the Open City Basketball second round match ... uh ... yo . So how 's the kid you picked up ? I 'm sure it was ... Allan Naismith . Huh ? ! Where am I ? he 's alive ! Mr. Dan ! Mr. Dan " ? I 've finally met you ! So you were searching for us this whole time ? no matter what ! Mr. Dan " ? Who are you calling " Mr. Dan " ? ! It doesn 't make me happy if a guy 's starry-eyed for me ! Mr. Dan ! when you have me ? you creep ! I 'll do the very best I can ! Mr. Dan ! Quit calling me that ! It 's because you keep calling me " Mr. Dan " that everyone thinks it 's funny and copies you ! Mr. Dan . I just told you to quit calling me that ! That group behind us has been making a racket for a while . Shall we leave ? guess so . ... and here of all places ! What 's wrong with that ? He 's asking so nicely . Don 't joke around ! You think the group can stand adding more useless baggage ? let 's go ! It 's enough just having jackasses like Iceman ! he 's gone ! Where 'd that jerk get to ? he said earlier he was gonna take a look around because the moon was pretty . Just look at how much that guy disrupts the group . I 'll go look for him ! Hey ! Don 't just leave in the middle of conversations ! What 's your problem ? Mr. Dan " ? I told you ... Mr. Iceman ! Mr. Iceman ! I wonder how far he went ? You can see the moon just fine from here ... Who 's there ? Princess ! You 're unscathed ! Jiiya ! Try calling me again . Pardon ? Princess . That 's not it . you can 't hear anything ? Maybe ... I heard it ! A very suspicious noise indeed ! Jiiya ! What could they be doing ? Hark ! Thieves ! alert ! shhhh ! Iceman and that kid are sure taking their sweet time . Dan ? As if ! why do I have to put up with this stuff ? Good nap . Got any food ? so why — food ! Hey ! Why are you chasing me ? We can 't just let someone go who 's seen what we were doing ! I didn 't see anything ! Jiiya shall face you ! Three men against a kid ? This boorish bunch hardly suits a night with such a beautiful moon . Y-You 're — Iceman ! What ? ! with Doni and Sarem ? Have you been well ? you — Chewy ... lizards ... Spanky ! You 're eating something again ? What are you guys doing here ? Mr. Dan ! during my evening jog I ran into some people I never expected to see . What ? You know them ? from my former team . Crap . More people gathering . Former teammates ? why don 't you look too happy to see each other ? so this town must be where you grew up . But why was it again that you quit ? Because of these injuries we couldn 't play plain basketball any more ! and how 'd you repay us ? Backstabber ! I see . You 're more of Destroy 's victims . Calm yourselves . but doesn 't that just make you feel empty inside ? But you are 100 percent at fault ! Oh ! But that makes it perfect ! Why not settle it with a match ? What ? I get it ! Nice one ! Yeah ! We were just looking for a team to play against anyway ! correct ? Basquash . You can 't fool my eyes . I see . In a match we can get our payback in front of everybody ! We 'll mess you up so bad you 'll never operate a Bigfoot again ! It appears I have no recourse . If you all feel so strongly about it . Then it 's decided . Yeah ! You 'll never beat — We have indeed accepted your challenge . Dan . O-Okay . H-His shades ? Rouge ! Rouge ! What ? what a lot of noise . After all the trouble we went to sneaking down here for a vacation ... They say Bigfoots are gonna play a match ! Bigfoots ? didn 't we see those kids in the restaurant yesterday ? that 's right ! But I have the feeling I 've seen them somewhere before then ... They 're the team who rampaged through Rollingtown and had to flee ! It was on TV ! Ohhh ... Let 's go see . let 's ! wait ! just 300 rollings per person ! Children are half-price ! hand me that part ? Here . Thank you . right ? Who knows ... It 's been quite a while since they 've played a decent match . And our opponents are Iceman 's former teammates . They might be pretty good . You 're prepared for whatever happens ? Iceman . Let 's make it a clean match . Dan ? FUCK YEAH ! } weren 't you ? You said you 'd hate to give up on having a match in this town . Of course . all sort of things need to go into it . Huh ? Meaning that the other team is not the only thing they must contend with . that was ... both teams are prepared ? The basket is there ! The whole vastness of this desert is the court ! Gotcha ! what are you doing ? Gotcha ! Shit ! That bastard ... You 're worthless ! What are you doing ? Whoopsy-daisie ! I see . This ought to shape into a fun game . Why you — Uh-oh . What 's gotten into them ? How 're they doing it ? They wearing shoes that float on the sand or something ? It 's way too hard to run in this ... I heard that you quit playing and went back home back home ... I get it ! That 's right . This desert is our home court ! Shut up ! Who cares if you 're a gnome short ! Doni ! Here ! Iceman ! Yes ! All right ! Thanks just now for that ! Pass it ! There he goes ! Destroy . Mr. Dan ! Ouch ... Iceman ? ! Don 't throw Destroy balls at your teammates ! destroy ! That Destroy player is so wild and cool ! It 's called " savagery . I suppose this is what to expect from people on the ground . Iceman ! What you 're playing isn 't basketball ! Basketball is ... wait a sec ! ... played like this ! this is hopeless . Maybe it is too much for them ... stick with him ! You little — that 's bad . this time we 've got you for sure ! Yeah right ! Iceman ? Pass it already ! it 'll be a Destroy ball ! even Iceman wouldn 't give up a chance at a pass with things perfectly lined up like this — Incoming ! Huh ? Sela too . Iceman . All your play does is hurt your own side . you 'll always be alone . too ? and how did you repay us ? Iceman ? ! has no right to play basketball ! Exactly ! He 's so right ! You 've got no right to play basketball ! Yeah ! I 'm gonna eat you ! Hey ! I 'm talking right now ! Shut up ! My talking comes first ! we 'll have a plain basketball showdown and leave out Destroy ! Iceman ! You really have no luck with men . Don 't tell me . Lately I 've really been wondering about that . Deary deary . What 's Dan doing ? Looks like he 's giving Iceman a piece of his mind . and no wonder . Iceman 's Destroy balls are keeping it from being a real game . They really are still children . What you with your eyes isn 't always the complete truth . Iceman ? ! ice-man ? I 've got an idea of my own ! the stupid-head says he 's got an idea ! Listen ! That 's right ! Listen good ! This is it ! You 're finished ! Is that all ? ! T-This is it ... You 're ... you 're finished . You 're finished ... He 's kind of nuts ! Awesome ! this isn 't a game at all now . Think maybe we should run away too ? destroy ! die ! That idiot ! Has Iceman gotten worse than he was before ? ! Yeah ! give up already ! you should run ! stupid-head ! Run ? You 're kidding . There 's no way I 'm running ! I can 't afford to run ! destroy ! Dan ! Iceman 's gonna throw his true Destroy ... Destroy ! ... and I 'm gonna take that sucker straight on ! That area 's ... Oh crap ! He stopped it . He did it ! He caught a Destroy ball ... Iceman ! Say your prayers ... Huh ? Dan . Nice catch . Y-You don 't mean ... Could it be every time up until now ... and all of them ... They were all passes ? Thought so . You ... are hard to understand ! run ! The basket ! The Destroy cleared off the sand and made a path ! Okay ! Mr. Dan ! Huh ? What are those three doing ? the other night ... That voice again . Basquash ! W-Wait a sec ! What is this ? ! and it 's these three ? were taken into custody near the desert city of Float Town . ' and so on — and scheduled for questioning soon . The hell ? Then they weren 't sportsmen at all . Iceman ? Barkas and the others must have had their own reasons for what they did after they quit basketball . Dan . The voice is getting distant . I 'm sick of this sand and dust everywhere . The next town will have plenty of distractions . Let 's sweat it out . Really ? Don 't promise more than you can deliver .

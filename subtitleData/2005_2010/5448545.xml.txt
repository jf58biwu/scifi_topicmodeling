 Previously on Heroes . I 'm going home . I 'm scared for my life , okay ? I know . Do you ? Gretchen . I 'm just not like you . And this thing here , just pretend it never happened , okay ? I 'm Haitianing you . We 're pretending that we 've never been to the Burnt Toast Diner ? I came to warn you , Peter . You need to know the truth . The answer you seek is here . What do you got ? It 's a body . What is it ? It 's me . One touch , Nathan , and it 's over . No ! Don 't touch him . You touch him , he 's got my power , his mind will go back into his body . Take my hand . Do it now . I said get away ! Back away ! I need you to go back eight weeks , Hiro . To a motel room in Texas . - To save his life ? - No . To save that film , before he destroyed it . Once you return , deliver it to me , your sweet Charlie will be set free . You have your film . Now I want Charlie . Soon . This is entry number four . When two or more of these forces are proximate , they amplify exponentially . Like a kind of gravity or magnetism . An abnormal spike in seismic activity as of late appears to be emanating from one of the individuals being held here . A pregnant woman , by the name of ... Doctor , he 's crowning . And I fear ... I fear that this child may indeed ... I 'm coming . It 's okay . It 's okay . Butterfly Man , open up . You can 't avoid me . I can see you 're in there . Open up ! You are in there , I know . Come out . Butterfly Man ! Hiro , is that you making all that noise ? I 've done what you asked . Now , please tell me where and when you put Charlie . It 's beautiful out , isn 't it ? Makes a man glad to be alive . It feels poetic that today is the day we give thanks . Stop ignoring me , Butterfly Man . I want Charlie . And you will have her , but there are more pressing matters to discuss . That film that you retrieved has brought everything into focus . I 've discovered the truth about my destiny . Our destiny . Give me Charlie . Sorry , not yet . There 's a nice sharp ax right over there . Go on . Freeze time . Chop me into bits . No , that 's right , you can 't . 'Cause if you kill me , you 'll never find Charlie . I 'm your savior , Hiro . You just don 't know it yet . Now , go help set the table . And smile . It 's Thanksgiving . So , when should I expect you ? I don 't know . Oh , you 've got to come . Happy Thanksgiving . I just don 't know that I 'm in the mood . Come on . You can invite Gretchen . Actually , I can 't . She moved all the way across campus . I 'm sorry to hear that . And that 's my fault , isn 't it ? It 's okay . It wasn 't going to work out anyway . So , I guess it 's official . I 'm a social pariah . And I haven 't helped things much . I want to make it up to you , starting with a real Bennet family Thanksgiving dinner . Turkey trimmings , the whole thing . What do you say ? And since when do you cook ? Well , you know , I 'm learning as I go . Is that a yes ? I don 't know . Is Lyle coming ? No . He sends his regrets . He can 't get away from school . Don 't make me be alone with your mother and Doug . She 's bringing the new boyfriend ? She never goes anywhere without him . It would mean a lot to me , Claire . Okay . There 's something I 've been meaning to talk to you about anyway . Great . I 'll see you at 4 : 30 , don 't be late . Love you . Noah ? Oh , my God . Lauren . Of all the supermarkets in all the towns in all the world ... It 's great to see you . You , too . What are you doing in Washington ? Well , after Primatech exploded , I was kind of unemployed . CIA seemed like the obvious choice . And you ? You know , little bit of this , little bit of that . Mostly that . I got a place in Dupont Circle . Nice . What brings you to this side of town ? These yams , these canned yams . I love them , and I can 't get them anywhere else . Hmm , didn 't peg you for a yam man . Oh , yeah , big yam man . You 're stalking me , aren 't you ? Yes , but I am also cooking Thanksgiving dinner for my daughter and my ex-wife . Ex-wife ? Yeah , Sandra left me . Can 't say as I really blame her , but we 're still on good terms . I mean , hence the over-sized bird . Are you having Thanksgiving on Christmas ? Because this frozen beast is not going to thaw until tomorrow . You need one of those already-cooked birds . Oh ... Okay . Follow me . Thanks . I appreciate it . Because I 'm not exactly an expert in life skills . How many people ? Four . Five , if you would like to join us . That is , if you don 't already have plans . And by the way you 're sizing up my single-serve turkey pot pie , you 've already surmised that I don 't have plans . It would be great to catch up . Happy Thanksgiving . Mom , what are you ... Please set up in there , boys . What is this ? Where 's your brother , honey ? That 's a good question . Would you please put these in a bowl for me ? We need to talk . Yes , I know . That 's what Thanksgiving is all about . Just families sharing our lives . Thank you , gentlemen . Okay , and please remember to stir some milk into that . That 's the way your brother likes it . Went to a storage unit yesterday , Mom . Rented out to you . Saw Nathan 's dead body . Rene told you about that . Well , it was not your brother 's body you saw . It was a shape-shifter posing as your brother . It 's the worst kind of identity theft , and he had to be stopped , and then we had to store him away discreetly . You can imagine , if the press had gotten wind . Matt Parkman also said that ... Matt Parkman said what ? Officer Parkman is unbalanced . Suicidal , last I heard . Because Sylar 's in his head ? Is that right ? What did you do , Ma ? Is my brother really dead ? Answer him , Mom . We 'd all like to hear that one . Happy Thanksgiving , Nathan . So , if you two will just help me set the table , we will sit down like a family , and we will discuss everything . Ow ! Let go of me , Nathan . Answer him . It 's Thanksgiving and you are my family . And we will sit down like a family as we do every year , or I will leave here and you will never hear from me again . Your choice . Hello . Hey , Happy Thanksgiving . Come on in . Something smells good . Look at this place . Are you sure this is your apartment ? We clean up good . So , what can I get you ? Some sparkling cider ? No , I 'm all right , but before everyone gets here I do want to talk to you about something . Okay , just let me check the gravy first , okay ? Oh , I got that . Claire , you remember Lauren ? She worked with me at Primatech . Uh ... Hi . Hi , you 're all grown up . You look beautiful . It 's okay , I got this , Wolfgang . Thanks . Does Mom know you brought a date ? No , no , no , no , Lauren 's not a date . She 's an old friend . She 's helping me cook . She is so a date . You should have told Mom . Your mother will understand . We 're a complex , modern family , and she 's got Doug . So , what did you want to talk about ? Hold that thought . Hi . Mr. Muggles . Hey , Happy Thanksgiving . You , too . Good boy . Hi , Noah , Happy Thanksgiving . A host gift . Thanks , Doug . Come on in . Hi , how are you ? Hi . Good , good . Who 's your little friend ? Dame Penelope Jean Lovegood III , but you can call her Miss Lovegood . Can 't she , Schnookums ? Yes , she can . Yes , she can . Claire , you remember Doug . Yeah , hi . Dinner 's ready , everyone . You hired a cook ? No , that 's Lauren . Wow , mistaken for a domestic . That certainly breaks the ice . Lauren Gilmore . It 's nice to finally meet you , Sandra . Okay , let 's eat . You brought a date ? No , that 's Lauren . Okay , who 's hungry ? Got lots to eat . Come on . Not a fan of Thanksgiving ? I 'm from Japan . We celebrate Kinro Kansha , not Thanksgiving . What 's the matter , Hiro ? You can talk to me , we 're family . I 'm not part of this family . I 'm a prisoner . No one 's a prisoner here . Samuel broke his promise . I fixed the past , but he won 't give me back Charlie . He 's a liar and an evil man . If the time traveler fixed the past , where 's Joseph ? That 's a good question . You got a minute , Hiro ? Come inside . We need to talk . Tell me , what did you do when you fixed the past for Samuel ? I 'm sorry , I cannot say . Samuel might get mad and Charlie 's at stake . I understand . I have to change for dinner . You stay a minute , will you ? You know , Hiro , we can help each other . I could use my ability . Really ? I can be inside of your soul . We can be as one . Painted Lady , I think you are trying to seduce me . You should know my heart belongs to Charlie . I 'm sorry . I 'm making you uncomfortable . But I need contact . Closeness to make this work . Of course . Every ability has a different set of rules . I can feel what you feel , Hiro . Touch me . You want Charlie back desperately . Yes . And now Samuel 's forcing you to work for him . But why didn 't he have you save his brother , Joseph ? I don 't know . You should ask Samuel . He 'll never tell me . You need to take me back . Eight weeks ago when a man from the government came to the carnival and murdered Joseph . No , I don 't think I should ... Please , I need to know the truth . Oh , no . You made us time travel . We must go back . Is that the man that killed Joseph ? No , that 's Dr. Suresh . We need to talk . Joseph . I 'm behind in my chores . Forget the chores . This is not good . All right , brother . But not here . Is this it ? Is this the night that Joseph gets murdered ? I don 't know . But it is very dangerous to be here . We must go before we step on a butterfly . Okay , Mom , you got us here sitting , just like you wanted , so talk . Peter , where are your manners ? Nathan , would you please say grace ? No . It 's Thanksgiving , Nathan . It 's the one day we should express our gratitude . What do I have to be grateful for ? I 'm dead . He knows it , you know it . Why don 't you tell us why , put us all out of our misery ? Tell us . I don 't expect you to understand or approve of the decision I made , but I hope you can keep an open mind and not condemn it . Sylar was going to kill the president . And you two had flown off to stop him at that hotel in Washington . And I had a dream about you , Nathan . I saw you fighting for your life . I also saw Matt Parkman save you . But I panicked and I went and found him and I dragged him to the hotel . But by the time we got there ... I was already dead . I made Matt Parkman do it . This is the part where I ask you to forgive me . So that body that we saw , that was Nathan . Technically , yes , but as far as the world is concerned , Nathan is still alive . Yeah , but I 'm not me . It 's your mind . They are your memories . You look exactly the same . You are Nathan Petrelli . You are my son . You 're Peter 's brother . And it 's been this way for months . And just because you know the truth , nothing has to change . We are still a family . To us . I would like to propose a toast to all of you for being here , on this my first Thanksgiving in this apartment . The first Thanksgiving I 've ever hosted . And especially to Lauren . Without her , we would all be eating Japanese take-out right now . To Lauren . To Lauren . So , Sandra , how did you and Doug meet ? Well ... May I ? Please . It was love at first sight . For Mr. Muggles and Miss Lovegood , that is . We met at the groomer . My little angel wouldn 't stop barking until they put her cage right next to his . Am I right , Sandy ? It 's true . Sandy ? Uh-uh . Dougie 's allergic . Legume intolerant . So , how did the two of you meet ? Well , Lauren and I used to work together at Primatech , and we recently reconnected . Yeah , this morning , actually . Frozen-food aisle . I troll the place for eligible men . Primatech . Is that the paper company or that other thing ? You know about that other thing ? Yes , dear . A memory can be erased only so many times . So , you worked closely then ? Well , it wasn 't like that , you know ... Or am I stumbling onto something that I 'm not supposed to remember ? You 're not stumbling onto anything . I think we should all just enjoy our Thanksgiving dinner . You know , in my family , on Thanksgiving , we used to go around the table and everyone would say what they were thankful for . Okay . I 'll go first . I am thankful for the two beautiful women in my life , Miss Lovegood and my beautiful Sandy . Aw ! Thanks . Okay . I am thankful that my daughter , Claire , decided to come for Thanksgiving . It would not be the same without her . I 'll second that . I 'm thankful for canned yams . How about you , Claire ? Um ... I know that I should be thankful , but I 'm just not feeling it right now . Is everything okay ? Her roommate moved out . And why on earth would she do that ? You 're so likeable . Doug , you don 't know anything about me . Claire . What ? You want to talk about it right now ? Fine . I 'm thinking about dropping out of school . My family ... This will surely be a Thanksgiving to remember . Where 's Lydia ? Not really sure . Amanda , sweetheart , where 's your mother ? I think she went to go find the Japanese man . Did she now ? Happy Thanksgiving . That man from India , he wasn 't writing a book , he wanted to talk about me . You sent me away , but I stayed , I listened , I heard everything ! How long have you been lying to me , huh ? You need to calm down , brother . You stop controlling me . Stop manipulating my emotions . Fine . You want me to let go . I will . My whole life , you 've kept me under your thumb . Why ? Because you 're dangerous , Samuel . What 's that supposed to mean ? Never mind . No , tell me what you meant . You can move the earth , Samuel , but it 's more than that . Cities , mountains . You have the power to kill millions . I can 't let that happen . I always thought I was missing out on something . Some untapped potential . Just tell me how . How can I be that powerful ? No . I 've already said too much . You think I wanted this life ? You had to be controlled from the day you were born . I gave up everything to watch over you . Let me free you of that burden . Show me the film . Let me learn what I am . Take responsibility for myself . Too late . I told Dr. Suresh to burn it . Why would you do that ? You can never know the truth . I 've made arrangements . A man from the government is coming to take you in . I gave him a compass . You betrayed me . My entire life , you betrayed me . I 'm still your brother . I love you . Joseph . No , no , no . No . Joseph ! Oh , God . What 've I done ? What have I done ? He 's coming . He 's coming . He 's coming , he 's coming . I know that you guys are freaking out , but I don 't think college is where I 'm supposed to be . Is this about Gretchen ? Because that is one relationship . Yeah , it is about Gretchen . And it 's about Becky , and it 's about everything that 's happened . Who 's Becky ? Mom , look , I just don 't think that I belong in college . And where do you think you belong ? Or have you even thought about it yet ? Maybe I 'll go for a year abroad . Maybe I 'll go backpack through Europe . A job . I just need to find somewhere where I fit in , where I could be myself . And the $ 40,000 I just gave to the school , where do you think that should go ? I don 't know , Dad . Where did it come from ? This is about what that guy Samuel said , right ? Who is Samuel ? What is going on ? Maybe it is . How could you even consider listening to him ? What is happening ? What did your father do ? This is not about Dad , it 's about me . I can 't lie anymore . I 'm a freak and people don 't like freaks . Can I just interject something here ? No . No . I think that we should all just take a deep breath . All I was gonna say is that what Claire is feeling is perfectly normal . I mean , we 've all felt like we didn 't fit in at one point or another in our lives . Heck , growing up and discovering I had a penchant for dog breeding , you think I had any friends ? Uh-uh . Trust me , Claire . This 'll all blow over . Really ? Is it , Doug ? Do you think that this is going to blow over ? What are you doing ? Claire . Oh , jeez . How 's that for normal ? Great . We need more wine . I have to tell them . No . You can 't say anything . If Samuel finds out I took you to the past , I 'll never see Charlie again . - I have something special . - I 'll be right back . Please . I 'm sorry , Hiro . We have to stand up to him . Some things are just too important . Where you been , friend ? I got lost . Well , now you 're found . Something going on over here ? No . Something in your hair . Well , then , you must be starved . Hiro , join me . Make yourself useful . Pass the cheer , will you ? Guess he 's never seen a regen before . So , some dinner , huh ? Par for the course . Especially when it comes to my ex-husband . I don 't know what 's going on between him and Claire . Well , I don 't know , either , but I think that Thanksgiving dinner was just his way of letting Claire know that she has a family that loves her . Nothing wrong with that . I thought you gave up all this . Yeah , so did I. And then I come across this compass which almost gets me killed . It turns out , it belongs to this strange man who shows up in my daughter 's dorm room threatening the normal life she so desperately wants . Well , maybe it 's impossible . Maybe I 'm just not supposed to have a normal life . Sounds like you 're giving up . Why did you cut yourself ? I don 't know . Maybe because you guys all think that you know what it 's like to be me , but you don 't . How could you possibly ? I have to lie to everyone , otherwise they faint . I know that it has been hard and I know that I have caused you pain , but I 'm concerned about you , Claire . These are not good people . They 're dangerous . You just have to trust me on this . Would you stop treating me like I 'm a child ? Then stop acting like one . Let me get this . Sorry , I 'm late . Hey , come on in . Who 's ready for pie ? Is there a problem , Mom ? Some family . You look at me , you don 't see your son . You see the man who killed your son . Don 't be silly . You . You don 't see your brother . Well , that 's because I 'm not your brother . Nathan . Guess again . Oh , God . Sylar 's in there with you , isn 't he ? We never should 've gone to Texas , Pete . Nathan ! Move back . Nathan ! Nathan ? Stop . It feels good to finally be me again . What 's for dinner ? I 'm starved . You know what makes this meal truly special ? It 's knowing that each and every one of you had a hand in making it happen . Just as we 've had a hand in each other 's lives , in our shared destiny . Heaven . We have depended on each other for so long , through good times and bad . But tonight , we should be especially thankful . The future is here . And it will be greater than my brother , Joseph , could ever have imagined . But I can 't tell you about it yet . Not while there 's a traitor in our midst . I just learned that the person who killed my brother is here . Sitting at this table . It 's time we all knew the truth , isn 't it ? Tell them , Samuel . You murdered Joseph . The time traveler saw it . Really ? Is that what you saw , Hiro ? I 'm sorry . I have to think about Charlie . I didn 't see anything . You know what you did . Why so angry , Edgar ? Is it because you 've done something shameful ? You killed Joseph , didn 't you ? You betrayed us to the government . And when Joseph found out , you killed him . You lying bastard ! What have you done ? I saved your life . Look . Thanks . I 'm gonna finish him . No , you can 't hurt him . He 's the only one who knows where Charlie is . He killed Joseph . I know , but this is not the time for revenge . Sometimes , a hero has to run away to live to fight another day . We will defeat him , I promise you . I 'll hold you to that . Only the guilty turn tail and run . Edgar is gone . Good riddance . I feel like I haven 't eaten in months . You think that 's some kind of existential soul thing ? You have a soul ? Come on , buddy . That 's the best you got ? No big speeches about hope ? Triumph of the human spirit ? Why don 't you let me out of this chair and find out ? And you ... You have raised the evil incarnate bar to an entirely new level . Thank you for giving me something to strive for . All this talk of souls and spirits has my head spinning . I 'm not a religious man . But there is one thing I do believe in , blood . Time to carve the turkey . Get away from her . What 's happening ? It 's Nathan . He 's in there . Come on , fight him , Nathan . Come on , fight him . Nathan 's dead ! No , he isn 't . He is still in you . His spirit and his mind are fighting for his family . Nathan ! Come on , Nathan ! Nathan . Nathan . Nathan , fight him . What have you done to me ? Nathan . Thanks . Noah , I 'm so sorry about that . It 's okay . So , my dad called you ? Yeah , well , he said you were feeling low , and he knew I was feeling low , so ... How 's your new roommate ? Fine . Dull . Actually , it 's awful . No one 's tried to kill me for days now . And she 's a slob . Well , you know , the other side of the room is still available . Sorry . You 're right . I don 't know why you would ever wanna move in with me again . Maybe because , of all the people that I 've met in college so far , you 're the only one who 's ever made any sense to me . Well , see , I told you you were gonna have fun . What do you think about Christmas ? How about a movie ? Much better . Should I give you my number , or were you just planning on stalking me in the produce aisle ? Canned goods , I think it was . My home number 's on the back . Use it . Happy Thanksgiving . You , too . Good night , ladies . Nice meeting you . Bye . Bye . We 're leaving , Claire . Happy Thanksgiving . Bye . Noah , it was a pleasure . Sorry about Doug . He 's fine . I told him he ate a peanut . He 's not the sharpest tack , but he 's a good man . Never a dull moment , Noah . Not if I can help it . Thank you . Bye . Bye-bye ! I 'm gonna go wait in the car . Thanks for the invite , Mr. Bennet . Any time . I guess " I 'm sorry " doesn 't begin to cover it . No , it 's not your fault . I 'm just ... I know . I know . You got a lot to figure out . I just want you to take your time and really think about your choices , Claire , because you do have choices . You 're absolutely right . So , you 're going back to school ? Yeah , classes start Monday , and I will be there . That 's great news . Love you . Love you . And thank you for inviting Gretchen . I wasn 't over-reaching ? No . It was actually the perfect Dad-thing to do . Next Thanksgiving , your place . It 's a date . Hey . Ready to head back ? Actually , no . We have a couple of days off before classes start , and I wanna find out where this leads . Where did you get that ? I stole it from my dad . He said I had choices , and I wanna know what they are . And this is gonna lead me to them . A compass ? Okay . You up for an adventure ? It 's okay if you 're not . I understand . I mean , we might run into Becky there . Yeah , she 's not one of my favorite people . But you are . So , which way ? Take a right . You saved Edgar . How honorable . Of course , when you betray me , you put Charlie in danger . Your brother was right . You are powerful , but I am powerful , too . I 'll make it so you never see her again . You won 't do that . You still need me . So , you tell me exactly when and where Charlie is . Or I am leaving . And you will be the one who is lost . I like this . Little man standing up for himself . But you don 't actually think I 'd ever let you leave , do you ? You don 't have a choice . I always have a choice . How do you feel , Hiro ? What have you done ? Look , I 'm gonna find him , and I 'm gonna bring him back , Mom . It 's over . It isn 't possible anymore . The one thing I know , the one thing I can count on since all this started , is that anything is possible . Sylar . Nobody wants him dead more than me . You wanna know what I want even more ? My brother alive . I 'll find a way .

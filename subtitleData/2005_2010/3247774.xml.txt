There 's no directive to hunt you . but they don 't know what to do ? man ? They do . I became obsessed with science . actually . And not really science at all . Scientists ... and then only nuclear scientists . The ones who invented the bomb . and Teller . geniuses all . I read every book I could . I wanted to understand these fathers of our destruction ? And why wouldn 't anybody stop them ? would I ? Morning . You look like hell . Up late . Newsper clippings ... bank records . Pamphlets from every high-tech company in the state . I even thought I saw the deeds to city hall somewhere . Those resistance guys weren 't sent back here to be our support crew . They 're a Skynet hunting party . Really ?

Let 's go . and bling . In the basket . keep the line moving . please . rings ... missy . and bling in the basket . Hold that . Come through . Excuse me .

Lucky you . - You look ... - Different ? The same . I can 't explain . I wouldn 't want you to . Is John ... He 's good . What about that machine ? She 's still around . Not that one . - The other . - No . Do you mind ? You brought it . Danny 's not here ? right ? He 's at school . He hasn 't come in a long time . I 'm sorry to hear that . Sarah ? and you always want something . but ... No . Nobody . Sorry . Cause one of them may be involved with Skynet right now . They might not even know it . Sorry to bother you . I 'll leave you alone . The fourth photo . The young one . His name is Andrew Goode . Andy . He was an intern at Cyberdyne one summer . Miles liked him . Is he going to die too ? he dies ? I don 't know . I hope not . just make sure it matters . Make sure it 's not in vain . No one dies in vain . Agent Ellison . They told me you were coming . Hoover was cross-dressing at Quantico . Ballistics . I can already tell you mine are bigger . Same gun that killed your boys here killed one of my CIs . Enrique Salzia . What 's the connection ? He made fake paper . Your guys had fake paper . 'cause I 'm not buying it . look at the print report . Interpol . small-time . Definitely not worth you putting your tie on and breaking open your Thomas guide . yeah . You see this every day . You didn 't find that curious ? Why would anyone wire a safe directly into the power ? Ellison ? Don 't overthink it . The guys were druggies . not terrorists . Your guy sold my guys paper . My guys whacked your guy to cover their tracks . Go back to your office . Your desk misses you . Right . Good one . Somebody came back here for whatever was in that safe . They 're out there . And I 'm gonna find them . buddy . Hey ! Can 't go in there ! Hey ! Enjoy . Have a good day . Can I help you ? No . Andy . Just looking . You just kept looking over like you needed something . That 's the phone . if I was gonna be alone on a desert island that would absolutely be the phone . Is that something you would do ? May I ? Got a four-meg camera . Texting ... true texting too . Not that SMS cartoon bubble junk . 3G data access . 10 Gigs free music . 6 hours of talk time and 36 standby on your battery . What happens if I press these numbers here ? 'Scuse me ? one through nine . will someone talk to me through the ear part up here ? Yeah . Okay . I 'll take three . Hello ? Hi . Are you calling me ? I was just following up to make sure phones are okay . I just left the store . I know . Okay . Do you wanna have dinner with me tonight ? No . you answered too quickly . Hear me out . Just give me one minute . - 30 seconds ? - Talk fast . first let me clear up the whole desert island and a cell phone thing . Seems kind of strange if you picture it . I wasn 't . of course . Why would you ? It 's an asinine sales pitch . There 's nowhere to plug in the phone . It would be worth less than a rock when the battery died . - Couldn 't use it to open a coconut . - This is you selling yourself ? I don 't know . There 's something immoral about the whole selling process . that 's your job . Part-time . And I 'm not very good at it . So I 'm actually less immoral than the average ... anyway . Where was I ? You 're right . About what ? I answered too quick . Mr. Baum . please . - Hi . - Hi . paper and pencil out . Time for a pop quiz . Here . Come in . I said come on in . I 'm transferring in . Okay . Any open seat . What part about don 't act like a freak didn 't you understand ? Sit down . - So ... - So ? your sweet uncle Enrique lived a colorful life . One we have not yet painted in full . You grow apart . Every day 's a new adventure . Who can keep up ? I got an uncle who 's like a father . I also got one who 's like a stranger . - How ' bout you two ? - More like an a aunt . chatty . All right . So you 're not too close . But he did call you three times the day he was murdered . What 'd you chat about ? those lakers . Really ? What about ' em ? Kobe . He 's the bomb . I always thought he was a ball hog . man . He 's got no one elsewho can shoot . Carlos ? Now that your uncle 's dead ? You all alone ? Yeah ... all these boys can shoot . I didn 't kill my uncle . No . And you 're too smart to know nothing about who did . I 'll be in touch . I know . The guy 's 18 months ahead of the germans . I would if I had that kinda grant money . I 'm not saying the guy 's a complete idiot . is it ? Why don 't they give the money to the people on the cutting edge ? But they never do . They never ... Hey . How was school ? I have a metal plate in my head . She 's gonna need a note . not her . fine . - You 're not gonna give me anything ? we learned . I didn 't get killed . I think . did you go ? - I did . And was she surprised to see you weren 't dead ? More like disappointed . She ID 'd one of the safe house photos . build rocket guidance systems or something ? Cell phone salesman . Shut up . Cell phone salesman . And not a very good one . These need to be cleaned . so about the cell phone guy . I-I 'm having dinner with him tonight . like a date ? - Not a date . - Are you going to kill him ? Kill him ? I don 't know the first thing about him . He interned at Cyberdyne when he was in college . His photo is in a pile of photos . Nobody dies till I say so . Tell her . People die all the time . They won 't wait for her . I fooled you again . Who are you ? How did you find me ? What--what do you want ? Are you a veteran ? Is that what this is about ? Do you speak ? Read that . How did you ... no . That 's not possible . That 's an epidermal growth rate . That 's just not sustainable . Keratinocyte and ... you couldn 't possibly maintain cell regulation or differentiation . It 's impossible . Possible . Woo was wrong . Thomason was wrong . Parker and Lang were almost right and still ... completely wrong . I was ... I wasn 't even close . Can you do it ? I 'd have to go to my lab . There 's a whole mix of ... EGF . I 'd need ... this is a lot of equipment . and blood . We 'd need ... at least 20 units . Preferably with tissues comprised of ... I brought my own . Can you do it ? Yes . I can . the german physicist Werner Heisenberg delivered a physics lecture to a packed hall in Zurich . an ex-professional baseball player working as a spy for the O.S.S. Berg 's task was to listen to the lecture and determine whether Heisenberg and the Germans were close to perfecting the atomic bomb . he was to wait for heisenberg outside the hall and shoot the scientist in the head . He had never killed anyone before . Andy ? I can 't imagine you majored in cell phone sales at college . No . No . More like funions and 12-packs of jolt from the vintage soda store while my roommates and I hacked Zelda 3 . So the princess would say funny lines ripped from reruns . boy ? Computer science . Caltech . Advanced ... dork . And what would you do with a computer degree from ... - Caltech ? - I don 't know . I never got one . Really ? My father died senior year . Mom went a little off the rails . I dropped out to help . I 'm sorry . but ... thanks anyway . She 's good . She married the security guard at her bank . You have family ? Distant . I think I can ask . Did you ever wanna be anything other than a waitress ? I did . What was it ? I can 't remember . Andy ? isn 't it great ? That is the official promotional poster for the Kramnik - Deep Fritz match . Awesome match . Just awesome . Most people cite the ' 97 Kasparov / Deep Blue as the watershed man versus machine chess match . But ... Fritz would have wiped the floor with Blue like Kramnik did with Kasparov . the other poster 's impossible to find . Andy ? Do you wanna see ? I wanna see . All right . Be hold ... the Turk . The Turk . not the original Turk . The original Turk was an automaton constructed and unveiled in 1770 by the baron Wolfgang von Kempelen . It played chess . Is that what your Turk does ? It plays chess ? I know that sounds boring as hell . Most people think so . But ... maybe I should put it this way . My Turk plays chess at a level that could defeat every human player that has ever lived and probably ever will live . That 's not bragging . A number of AIs can do that now . But the AI chess platform is very valuable for artificial intelligence developers these days . What ? I thought I saw someone outside . It 's a prowler . Back porch . It 's the police . There 's been some break-ins in the neighborhood . Andy . wait . It 's 165 Mesrow . Sarah ! what did it look like ? What did it look like ? Who cares what it looked like ? It was just a rack of computer equipment . but was there obvious network access ? Do you know what kind of bandwidth ? Are you joking ? - like a fan or something ? - John . I 'm just trying to get a sense of the horsepower . I wanna know if this thing was a ... dinky little homemade soap box or if it was a full-fledged AI platform capable of learning and growing and taking on other applications . It plays chess . So did Einstein . Have you ever heard of the singularity ? It 's a point in time where machines become so smart that they 're capable of making even smarter versions of themselves without our help . That 's pretty much the time we can kiss our asses good-bye . Unless we stop it . Like you said you would . So I caught a break on a set of fingerprints from our drug dealers . I wanted to see your face when I laid that on you . the only fingerprint database I hadn 't checked was kid prints . That 's no joke . That 's one of your dead terrorists . brown-eyed 35-pound four-year-old boy living Ohio . And that 's the look I wanted to see . Hold up . Did your crime scene guys find any peculiar blood ? I think they got all the peculiar they could stomach with these prints . Lab says some blood evidence found at my ci crime scene is almost human ... except there 's no red blood cells present . I wanna see the blood evidence from your guys . I 'll get back to you . right ? in Canton ? Have a party . the one thing nobody thought possible was the use of a synthetic oxygen carrier . it obviates the need for the marrow interaction . The real world applications are ... mind-blowing . It 's ready . I ... have a video camera . - Would it be all right if ... - Move away . Who are you ? What are you ? Sarah ? Didn 't you get my message ? I returned your call about the test results . I got your message . You 're healthy as a horse . A healthy horse . I got that from your message . I wanted to talk to you about prevention . For cancer ? What you 're doing seems to be working . Specifically . Don 't smoke . Get lots of exercise . Eat leafy greens . Don 't snort asbestos . but you 've got no risk factors . No genetic disposition . Is there anything else about your history that I should know ? No . right ? I got two myself . You worry . You wanna make sure you 're always healthy and strong for them . Don 't drive yourself crazy chasing the future . We can 't predict ... you know ? We can only ... try and prevent . it 's Sarah . - Hey . - Hi . - You going to chem ? - Yeah . What is going on ? No idea . slutty whore . I love this color . right ? This color 's tight . - What is it ? - Rash . It 's so tight . I 'm a pig . I look pregnant . Does it make me look fat ? Yes . What the hell ? What 's your problem ? You asked . Bitch whore much ? I don 't understand . I said bitch ... whore ... much ? What are you looking at ? I 'm looking at you . right ? Right ? You saw it ? It 's so ... and right out there ! It 's freaking big . Right . right ? Whoever 's doing this is such a jackass . who would do this ? And how would they even know ? My parents ... they 're gonna kill me . Kill me ! how could someone just ... You 're upset . No kidding I 'm upset . My life is freaking over ! Here 's a present . It 's tight . I wondered if I 'd see you again . Miracles happen every day . That 's funny . right ? it was a joke . So the ... police recommended I put in a security system . that kind of thing . though . - You think someone wants the turk ? Eight years of my life . Not just the software . I customized the hardware too . I worked so much on a motherboard that I lost my sight for three days . That really happened . Those circuits are so small . A lot of the gears I actually pulled from gaming platforms . Did you know that the military uses them ? I 've got the guts of three Xboxes and four Playstations daisy-chained . Plus some seriously modded-out code that I swear came to me in a dream . And all this to beat another computer at chess . None of this to beat another computer at chess . Then what ? What are you doing ? Would you believe me if I told you turk has moods ? but sometimes and it 'll solve it one way . it solves it differently . it can 't even solve it at all . Do you know why it does that ? No . neither do I. Someday ... I 'm gonna figure it out . Turk 'll tell me . - You talk about it like it 's human . you never know . What ? Too far ? What is it ? Nothing . Nothing at all . Do you like this color on me ? What ? I 'm a bitch whore . What ? I have a new friend . Did she tell you you were a bitch whore ? No . She cried . Wait ... what ? what the hell is this thing ? Jumper ! Outside the gym ! Jump ! Jump ! She 's not gonna jump . She 's just trying to get attention . come on ! That 's my new friend . The crying one from the bathroom . When ? three minutes ago . Four minutes ago . She 's upset . Her parents are gonna kill her . Did you do anything to her ? I tried to give her a tight present . We gotta help her ... now ! - No . - I 'm going up there . Let me go ... I order you to let me go ! Don 't be a freak . Gotta go ... now . I could havedone something . I was right there . Maybe . Mom . this girl ... they 'll find a way . You didn 't see her . you wouldn 't be talking like this . be a hero ? your face ? Isn 't that what I 'm supposed to be ? A hero ? Isn 't that who I am ? then what are we doing ? What 's the point ? Why not just give it to them if we 're gonna act like them ? I don 't know how to help him . Andy Goode must be killed . James . He took his friggin ' eyes . the world 's first atomic bomb exploded . A white light pierced the sky with such intensity that a blind girl claimed to see the flash from a hundred miles away . J. Robert Oppenheimer quoted a fragment the destroyer of worlds . " put it another way when he leaned close to Oppenheimer " Now we are all sons of bitches . " Now we are all sons of bitches .

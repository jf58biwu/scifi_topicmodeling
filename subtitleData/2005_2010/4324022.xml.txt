 Homeland Security 's been keeping a close watch on two brothers . Scientists . Stefan and Vincent Manford . David , you got to think these guys are up to something more than just sending wine to the President . I think I 'd like to meet them . - The yeast is more of a vector . - A delivery system . You guys are trying to find a way to put a vaccine in bread ? That is fucking brilliant . They missed it , Vincent . We knew they would , Stefan . Going back to New York is a good thing . They 'll stick me . I dumped their dope and that shit is worth , like , half a million bucks on the street . - David . - What is it , Bob ? Emissions from cars and factories , trapped by the inversion layer . Combined with the massive pollution moving across the Pacific , complicated by the gases emitting out of Mount Popocatepetl . Theoretically , David , we could be heading towards a perfect pollution storm over Mexico City . What the hell do you guys do here ? Sulfuric acid at that pH level it 'll melt things , flesh will burn on contact Now , there 's a few hours left . Forget it , we 're not going get enough ammonia . No , even if we tapped into U.S. supplies and got them here in time- - 350,000 metric tons would only bring the pH of the cloud up to 2.5 maybe if we 're lucky . Clear rain has a pH level of what ? 5.6 . - We need something else . - And a lot of it . Authorities have decided to declare the high alert yellow flag Mexico City and outlying areas in a state of panic . We cannot ... Roads are clogged , people are being forced onto buses , families are a little girl lost in the chaos of the evacuation . Airlines have cancelled all flights to the Mexixo City airport . The fucking water in the Gulf of Mexico ! OK . Ocean water has a pH level of 8.5 , right ? And it 's full of bicarbonates . So here 's what we 're going to do . The pH level of the acid is 1 . Ocean water 's 8.5 . We know that ammonia will easily neutralize the acid . So we 're going to dump in as much ammonia as we can get our hands on - in combination with the ocean water . - And we got plenty of that . Bob , what is the pH we can live with in the rain ? - Five . - We can live with , Bob . Four point seven . Four point seven . OK . So how much ? How much ? 350,000 metric tons of ammonia . 48 Canadian air tankers have landed in California . Okay , we need water scoopers too , lots of them . I 'm on it . David , we could add calcium carbonate . Sure . How much can we put in there before it turns to cement ? Bob . Bob . - Three hours till it rains acid , David . - Bob ! 3,467 thousand tons . 2.09 - Gene In a Bottle Yes , we are pretty tied up right now monitoring the situation in Mexico City . Anything ? The planes are over Mexico City . We 'll know soon . Okay . Sorry , Governor . A 50 percent increase in suicides ? And you don 't think it 's related to the hurricane damage Katrina caused ? Yeah , I agree , this is something we should look into . So send us all your data . Medical Examiner . Police . Psychiatric . Everything you have . Okay , bye . Maman , qu 'est-il arrivé ? Carlos , je suis dans le jardin . Il pleut . S 'il te plaît , va dans la maison . Non , non . Je t 'appelais pour te dire que tout va bien . Quoi ? Oui , mes bougainvillées , mes arbustes , mes fleurs , la jardin entier se porte parfaitement bien sous la pluie . Tout va bien . Grâce à Dieu . We decided ammonia alone would not work sufficiently to save the people . So our scientists at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico recommended ocean water mixed with bicarbonate of soda and calcium carbonate . It worked ... Brilliantly . Never should have happened . It will happen . Again and again . Mayko ! - What ? - This isn 't a hotel . Go home . Get some sleep . All of you , go home and get some sleep . - Goodnight , David . - Hey ! Good work , everybody . Thank you . Good work Mayko . David , I need to talk to you about a new case . Can it wait till tomorrow , Caroline ? I 'm beat . - First thing in the morning ? - Promise . - Okay , goodnight . - Yeah . Goodnight . Hey Owen . - You can read ? - Yeah . G ood . - Where were you last night ? - Just putting out some fires in Mexico . Shit . What 'd you eat ? I was waiting for you . Oh . Sorry . I 've got to take a shower . So ... Go down to that 24 hour place and buy us something that doesn 't look too disgusting , alright ? All right . Oh , uh . Sorry . This chick called last night . Said ... Harlan died . The funeral was today . And the shiver starts tomorrow . You OK ? I 'll go get the groceries . - Hi . - Shalom . Laura ... I just got your message this morning . I 'm so sorry . Thank you . Can I get you a coffee , or some cake ? No , I 'm fine . I don 't think you know my sister , Hilda . Hilda , this is David Sandstrom . Harlan 's friend , David . Thanks for coming . He spoke so highly of you . Excuse us , Hilda . - Nice to meet you . - Me too . So , Laura ... Steven , Julie , I asked you not to run through the house . Laura . What happened ? The car was flattened . When they finally got him out ... it was horrible . He was drunk , David . Harlan ? The party . It was his brother 's birthday party , and ... I 'm usually the designated driver . But I was at home with two sick kids ... Laura , do not do that to yourself . He was always in here . Working away . Taking care of us . I admired him so much . He always knew how to balance everything , you know . His teaching . His research . You and the kids . He was a good husband - and a good man . - We had a lot of laughs . Laura , if there 's anything I can do for you . - There is something . - Name it . Harlan was doing research for Lowy . The funeral was just yesterday and they had a lawyer from the company come over here last night asking for Harlan 's laptop and all of his files . That 's corporate paranoia . See , they figure if you sign a contract with them , they own you and your first born . I didn 't give them anything . It 's just ... Harlan was working on something on his own . Nights . Weekends . - What ? - I don 't know . All I know is he said what he was working on could be a potential money-maker . He said even millions . You should get a lawyer to take a look at it . - Isn 't your brother ? - He read the contract . If it 's directly related to what Harlan was working on , then Lowy owns it . If not , it 's mine . I just don 't know what it is . You want an opinion ? What 's the name of this clown who came to see you last night ? His card is over here . This is everything . His lab books ... His computer ... Take whatever you need . Right . If there 's anything in here , I 'll find it . I 'm a mensch . It 's going to be okay . Hey Jill ! Hey , what 's up ? Hey , Owen . What are you doing out here ? I 'm waiting for David . The prick at the front desk wouldn 't let me in . - It 's cold out . - You should do up your jacket . Yeah ... Do you know where he is ? Just thought maybe he could ... - give me some money for food or ... - You alright ? Well , it 's cold out . Are you high ? - What ? - Owen , look at me . Look at me . - What are you doing ? - What do you mean what am I doing ? Coke ? Crack ? Crystal meth ? Meth ? Wow . Do you know what you 're doing to your brain ? - Fuck you . - Would you like to know ? OK . So I did a little meth . What 's the big fucking deal ? That meth is carving a pathway through your veins trying to get to your brain and your spinal fluid . And all of these chemicals : Norepinephrine , dopamine , S erotonin , are gushing out of your brain . Pressure 's going through the roof . Your heart is racing . You feel fantastic and one of these days , you 're going to have a sweet little convulsion and die . So that 's the big fucking deal . This is not really what I need , but ... Thanks , Mom . Owen , don 't walk away from me . Nice . Caroline . What is all this ? Suicide data from Arkansas ? Oh , good it came in . You 're going to have to make sense of something that makes no sense . - Sure . - I want you to go through the data . Put together a presentation to get everyone up to speed . I think this is right up your alley . Well , looks like he was randomly inserting promoter traps in a mice . I love how these things work . You know , you drop them in , they cozy up to the gene next to it , and say , " Hey baby , show me your goods . " Yep . It turns the gene on and the gene does what it 's supposed to do . Causes cancer , maybe cures it . - Maybe it grows eyeballs . - Yeah well ... You know multiple eyeballs , while very cool , would hardly be a reason to tell your wife you 're coming into a boatload of dough , right ? Actually I think these genes have something to do with sexual reproduction . Multiple orgasms ? I 'd pay for that . This one in particular , David ... This one here , it 's always been a suspect . So what was he looking for ? - Was he a close friend ? - Used to be . Then he had kids and sort of disappeared into the bosom of his family . Which is maybe something I should have done . Good scientist ? Very , but he was more ... you know , tortoise than hare . Hard worker , never gave up . You had to admire his tenacity , but if Harlan found something , he stumbled on it , no question . Well , it 's not going to be easy , to recreate his stumbling . FL472 . He didn 't finish a history on this one . What do you make of this ? It looks like some kind of code . FL472 . Well , the mice are at the U of T. So let 's get the little guys down here , and find out what they do . Owen , I need to speak with you . Call me when you get this message . 200 bucks missing from my wallet . - Owen ? - No , elves . All I know is that I took 300 bucks out of the machine last night I spent 40 , now I 've got 60 . Well ... I have a pretty good idea what he spent it on . I saw him about an hour ago . He was flying . - On what ? - Meth . You know the shit they 're selling on the street these days . Some of it 's got lithium from batteries , lye , red phosphorus from matches . It 's poison , he 's going to kill himself . So I 'm not going to get my money back , so is what you 're saying . What I 'm saying is , if you ever see him again - which you probably won 't - tell him to stop - which he probably won 't - and then all you can do is wait for him to hit rock bottom , which he absolutely will . Thanks for getting me into this . Hey Carlos ! Our visitors are here . Thanks . Welcome to NorBAC . It 's been a long time since I had a chance to do mouse work . You usually work in breeding pairs . Don 't you ? - Yes . - Well according to these labels ... They 're all boys . Maybe there is something special about these males . Harlan seemed to be studying reproduction , maybe he was studying male reproductive diseases : prostate cancer . Hi guys . We 're waiting for you , david . - What 's going on ? - Have a seat . Mayko . Okay , so ... This is the path of Hurricane Katrina in the summer of 2005 . Now , after major disasters , suicides in affected zones usually increase 30 % . - What are we talking about ? - Just listen . Okay ? But ... the spike in the suicide rate from the area in question is actually a 50 % spike . And , it 's not part of Katrina 's path . So , these people actually weren 't affected by the devastation . The increase in suicides started in New Orleans , as expected . But then over the last year or so , it spread up through here and as high as Arkansas . Suicide ? Suicides don 't " spread " . From what I 've been told , suicide is higher amongst teens and seniors and usually there are different suicide rates for males and females , different races . True . But in the counties in the 50 % zone , the results are the same across all demographics . Even kids . - Kids ? - Wes contacted some families of victims . One of them emailed me this . - He 's 7 years old . - Cute . Happy go-lucky . Much loved . Two days after this was taken , he grew severely depressed . Two more days , and somehow he made his way to a bridge . They found him a few hours later downstream , snagged on a branch . - So people are killing themselves for no reason . - Yeah . They 're happy , healthy . And then sudden depression . CDC 's been tracking this for weeks . They want us to have a look at it . It sounds like a job for a bunch of shrinks , not NorBAC . Come on David , don 't you think this is weird ? I mean , little kids ... little kids don 't just kill themselves . I thought you said everything was biology . All behavior . All emotion . No , I said all behavior has a biological component . Including depression ? Yes . Okay . So let me reframe it for you . Find me the biological component in suicidal people in the 50 % zone . - Sure , Caroline , piece of cake . - Thank you . I want to get somebody right on that . What ? Yeah . Oh hi , Jim . I got your number from Laura Sendak . I 'd like to get together with you , it 's about Harlan 's research . Oh , I know you 're interested . Well if it 's not prostate cancer ... " Mice sterile after promotor trap placed beside gene X-313 of chromosome 4 . Tested sperm , good motility , no pathology . So what 's wrong ? " And it ends there . What if he stumbled upon PEA3 mice ? - What 's that ? - Well ... The males provide complete testosterone but are sterile . The female mammary glands develop abnormally . It 's always been a bit of a race to figure out why . - Worth money ? - Well ... If it transfers to human infertility , yes . We should look into that . Absolutely . What else ? I don 't know . How long would it take to get female mice in heat ? Five minutes . There 's always some downstairs . Why ? We 're starting a reproductive gene , let 's see what they got . Okay . Go . It looks like he 's more interested in the buffet , Bob . He looks like he 's about to take a nap . I think generally that 's done afterwards . I want to try something . Carlos , what are you doing ? Males will kill each other . Maybe these won 't . Still , it 's not our experiment to ... experiment with . Bob , I don 't think they 're going to fight . I have a feeling that these boys ... would rather ... What ? I suspect that he randomly placed the promoter trap next to a gene . Yeah . But that gene was the gene that determines ... sexual preference ! No fucking way ! - Harlan ... He did ? - Maybe . I think he had scientific evidence that being gay is genetic . Okay . Wait , wait , wait . In a mouse ! No . If I had a dollar for every time cancer got cured in mice and they couldn 't translate it to humans , I 'd be a millionaire . So let 's just ... Let 's just sit down . What else could it be ? Maybe it 's a gene that makes the males smell like females and that 's why they 're humping each other . - But they wouldn 't hump the females . - Oh , shit . You know , he had a lot on X-313 . Okay , okay . Bob , I 'm going to need you to pull up that section of human DNA that corresponds to the mouse DNA . On average , there 's an 85 % similarity between human and mouse genes . Yeah , I know . So there 's a 15 % likelihood that they don 't match . But I think if it 's similar there 's a high probability that it does exist in humans . X-313 on chromosome 4 . Human DNA . The corresponding region is on chromosome 8 . And ... Here 's the gene . Okay . See here ? And here ? They look 99.9 % identical . One amino acid difference . And so ... wow . Your friend was right , David . This is huge . Bob , I want you to go into the genome bank , and pull up 10 heterosexual males and 10 homosexual males . We 'll compare them . Then we 'll know . Of gay mice and gay men . Match . Match . Close enough . Match . - Match . - Ten of ten . - Heteros . - Match . - Jesus ... match . - Is this for real ? - They all match ! - Shit ! This is incredible ! OK , we should really keep quiet about this until we figure out the right way to deal with it . Why ? It 's not our discovery , Bob , for one thing . And then , you know , just putting it out there ... Help me out with this . Well , the psychosocial impact of an announcement like this - could cause more harm than good . - Exactly . And there 's something else . Harlan said this was gonna make him rich . Discovering the gay gene might bring you a lot of fame , but not necessarily fortune . Unless you could find a way to affect the function of that gene . What do you mean ? - Never mind . - It 's okay , Bob . Well , if you 've got a gene that promotes a certain type of behavior , especially one that 's considered undesirable in a lot of places amongst a lot of people , wouldn 't you want to see if you can ... turn that behavior off ? A drug . Or a chemical compound to suppress the gene . - Maybe it was his next move . - It 'd be my next move . This makes a lot of sense . I found a patent application for a molecule in Harlan 's lab books . He 'd put it through various testing processes that make me think its utility was drug-related . I think it might have had something to do with the mice . - Order it . - You can 't . But we can get a chemist to synthesize it for us . Okay , do it . Let 's try it out . - Hey , David . - Owen , good to see you . You going back to the loft ? I thought I 'd hitch a ride . Sure , let 's talk about some money first though . I take it you borrowed some from me . - What ? - 200 bucks . From my wallet on the dresser . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Look at me . Hey ! Look at me . You sound a lot like your girlfriend . - I don 't have a girlfriend . - Okay , well , your friend , Jill . She 's had it out for me from the start and I don 't know what the hell she 's been feeding you . - Maybe the truth . - Maybe bullshit . I want you out of my place , Owen . Gimme my keys back . - I was gonna pay you back . - Oh really ? Would you get a job or you gonna steal the money from somebody else ? The keys , Owen . Come on ! I was gonna pay you back ! I 'm not a thief . Look , to show you there are no hard feelings , here 's the rest of it . And that 's the last you 're going to get from me . The point I 'm trying to make is that Western society is starting to accept homosexuality . - Slowly , but yes . - Yeah , but come on , it 's come a long way . And if this drug works , it could ... set it all back to attitudes of fifty years ago . That your disease can be cured with this handy little pill . But all I 'm saying , David , is that men in different parts of the world would appreciate having a choice . Well what about you , Carlos ? What if you got tested and discovered that you didn 't have the gene ? Does that make you a pervert ? Does it erase all the years you 've spent fighting for who you are ? Okay , look . Let 's just hang on to this for a little while . We 'll test the drug . Think about what the fuck to do with it . Let 's not worry about it right now . Okay ? - Okay . - Bob ? Did you know lobsters are cannibals ? It 's true . If put them in a cage together they 'll eat each other . Well , that 's why I invited you over here tonight , Bob . So you could eat them before they ate each other . Thank you , David . - Beer 's here . - It 's about time . So , what 's going on ? Well , we think we found ... Well , David 's friend found the gene for sexual preference . A gay gene ? The gene for sexual preference . So , what ... for women and men ? Yes and no . You see if a man gets it , he is more attracted to men . If a woman gets it , she 's more attracted to men too . - So it 's like a horny gene ? - I guess so . Bon appetit . I don 't know David , I think you 're opening up some very delicate ethical issues . What 's the problem ? Some redneck gets tired of the " homo " he 's working with , just slips him a couple of pills in his coffee . What about the US military ? There goes the whole homosexuality deferment issue out the window . And let 's not even go there with the Christian Right . - Anybody want ice cream ? - God , I am totally full . You find a gene , next comes a genetic test and then a cure . Sorry , it must just be the baby . We got our tests results back . He 's gonna be a boy . Brown hair . Blue eyes , 6 feet like his Daddy . But Mike 's having second thoughts ... The baby 's gonna be gay . Sorry , Mayko . Did you want ice cream ? No , David I don 't want any . - Um ... Bob , ice cream ? - Ice cream ! I was miserable . Now , for my heartburn , I take " Latrapsalin . " And for my homosexual tendencies , I reach for " Gay Away " , the dust that makes fairies fly away . Fast acting Latrapsalin . For heartburn relief when you need it most . Carlos ? - Ice cream ? - Thank you . So does the world really need a " cure " for homosexuality ? - Is it a disease ? - We 're asking the wrong questions here . Take the guys who built the bomb , right . I don 't think the question for them was ever " Should we build it ? " They had to . It was either them or the Nazis . I think the questions that kept them up at night was probably ... Who 's going to build it first ? You know . And what 's going to be done with it ? So what are we going to do with our bomb , guys ? David , Caroline really wants us to get on this suicide thing . - Okay , I heard you . What ? - Okay . So the Brenner County report says : " suicide is normally associated with family breakdown , poverty , unemployment , drug abuse , alcoholism , and incarceration ... However , research shows recent suicides in the county no longer follow this pattern . " It 's the same old crap over and over , Mayko . Everybody is saying something is wrong , I get it . I know . And no one is saying what it might be . It looks like we 're starting from scratch on this one . Wes ! Where the fuck are those body parts ? If you mean the samples from the suicide victims , they 'll be here this afternoon . - .3 ccs , right ? - Right . Any idea how long before this takes effect ? No . Even the chemist who put it together doesn 't know what it was for . Well , let 's find out . And David will probably want to know what happens . I 'll go get him . Homosexual male , meet heterosexual females-in-heat . Now there 's a boy who knows how to tango . David , you got an update on the suicides ? I 'm working on it . I 'm busy right now . - Is this business or pleasure ? - A little bit of both . David , I 've got two Governors calling wanting answers . - Get on it . - Okay . Here . Mayko , body parts . - Oh . Thanks , Wes . - Update please , Mayko . Caroline is breathing down my neck on this thing . McGuinn 's calling , Governors are all over him . Where 's our money going , what 's the use of NorBAC , do you get it ? - Chill out , Wes . - I 'm completely chill . Okay . Initial pathology on the suicides from Arkansas looks fine but neurotransmitter levels had spikes in dopamine and serotonin . - What does that mean ? - Well basically there 's nothing grossly abnormal about the specimens but ... David thinks it points to a chemical imbalance somewhere . - I see . - So , we 're going to run some tests and see if we can identify any chemicals that might be in the brain and hopefully that 'll give us a clue as to what is causing this . Thank you , Mayko . Let me know what you come up with . Sure . Okay , so . David wants blood to Sunnybrook . Intestines to U of T. Pulmonary to Queen 's . Heart tissue to Mt . Sinai . We 're doing liver , kidney , pancreas and brain here . What you 'd do ? Rob a Starbucks ? No . I picked up some bottles and cans and ... I did some panhandling but I didn 't steal it . - Look , I know I fucked up . - You stoned now ? - No . - You were yesterday when you came looking for me . I was on the street , and some guy offered me a toke . Oh . So you were just being polite , eh ? Look , I know you 're mad at me , and ... you probably don 't want anything to do with me . I 'm sick , man ... I know I got a problem . What do you want , Owen ? I just ... I know I need to get better but that 's hard to do out there . I just ... need a place . Look , I wanna beat this . I do . Come in . I have no idea what that is , Bob . I found a phorbol . No one 's ever seen before . Bob , there 's thousands of phorbols . Actually , there are 1832 . This is 1833 . Okay , where did you find it ? I found it in all the samples of the suicide victims . Brains , and all the other organs . Fuck ... PKC . Maybe I made a mistake interpreting the data . I doubt it . PKC . Protein Kinase C. It is an enzyme that does important work in your body . What does this protein do exactly ? In the brain , too little , you get depressed . Too much , you get bipolar . - And both roads can lead to suicide . - Exactly . In a normal brain , you got regulators to control the level of PKC . - Neurotransmitters . - Right . It 's all part of normal nerve function . But the neurotransmitters can get thrown off by these things called phorbols . - Fur balls ? - Phorbols . We use them in the lab all the time in our experiments . Like if you want to activate cancer growth in human cells . - They also activate PKC . - So that 's it ? Phorbols ? Not exactly . The people west of the Mississippi , they have a lot of a phorbol of some kind in their system . And ? Phorbols don 't occur naturally in humans . - So where 'd they come from ? - I have no idea . They belong in trees and stuff . And there 's something else . This is a new one . It 's never been seen before . Bart ? David Sandstrom . The Leafs are doing just fine , thank you very much . Listen ... Oh absolutely . Make it a hundred . Listen , we found some phorbols in some suicide victims . You know , I know it doesn 't make any sense . I don 't know , Bart , that 's why I 'm calling you . Well look , do you know of anybody who might be able to ... - Got a minute ? - Hang on , Bart. No . What ? I just got a phone call from Audrey Graves , remember her ? Bart , just see what you can find out and call me back . Thanks . So , Audrey , eh ? How 's she doing ? Health wise , pretty good . Same with the baby . She 's back to work full time . - Good . - She wanted some answers . About what ? Harlan Sendak . What about him ? According to Audrey he was doing some work - for Lowy Pharmaceuticals . - Yeah . Lowy have filed an injunction that we - NorBAC - are not releasing research that belongs to them . NorBAC has nothing to do with Harlan 's personal research . - Not according to Audrey . - I don 't care . Harlan Sendak was a friend of mine . And he died in a car crash last week . So what 's the problem ? You 've been spending a lot of time on this personal project ? Yeah , so ? So , you should have told me before using the lab 's resources - and our scientists ' time to help you do it . - Come on , Caroline . David , we entered into an agreement with Audrey Graves and American Pharmaceuticals . No , you have entered into an agreement . A 35 million dollar agreement , David . So , if they want to have a look at some research that they feel is potentially theirs , we have an obligation to show it to them . - It 's not theirs . - Then let them determine that . No . Not this stuff . Not this time . Okay ? Just gimme a break with this one , Caroline . - Excuse me . - Hey . Come on in . - Anything else ? - Yeah . You work on any outside projects , you find a cure for the common cold , you buy a pencil , I want to know about it . Understood ? - Sure thing . - Good . - Carlos . - Hey . - Let 's take a walk . - What was that all about ? Lowy Pharmaceuticals wants Harlan 's research . - How do you know ? - I met with one of their lawyers . I was trying to keep things personal , but now they 're going after NorBAC , so we 're running out of time . The truth is , David , I don 't think we can hold the research any longer . If we give this to Lowy , they 're going to figure out a way to make it their own . I 'm sure they will . It 's a very powerful discovery . Yeah . A discovery that was made by Harlan Sendak . Maybe you should talk to Laura ? See what she wants to do . Man , I already got something in the works . - I could have come up . - Nah-nah , it 's all right . Did you want to talk to me about something ? - It can wait . - Okay . You wanted to talk ? Why did you let Owen back in ? - What happened to " give the kid a chance " ? - I 'm sorry . That was before I knew he was using . Don 't worry , he was clean when he came home . He 's lying to you , David . How 'd you know that . I know addicts . All right . Okay . My " thing " was prescription pills . I went through treatment three times . And the third time worked . It was eleven years ago , okay . - I 've never gone back . - Jill , I 've seen you drink . Recovering addicts didn 't drink . Right , well , alcohol was never my addiction . Although I 'm sure someday it could be . Or cigarettes or God or ... Who knows ? Um ... The only reason I 'm telling you this is because ... I don 't want you to get hurt by Owen , okay ? You can 't trust him . He 's not who you think he is . What do you want me to do , Jill ? Just watch your back . Okay . - Hey . - Hey . What 's going on ? Nothing . What 'd you do today ? Just chilled here . Got any plans for tomorrow ? Not really . - You do any shit today ? - Meth ? No . Do you want to ? Yeah . Okay . Um ... If you 're going to stay here , we gotta do something about that . I am . I 'm staying away from it . No . It 's not just enough to stay away from it , Owen . 'Cause it 's everywhere . It 's like ... It 's like there 's a bar on every block in this town . Some days , I feel like I could hit every one of them . You ever do that ? Yeah , I 've been known to . Okay , yeah , on occasion . But it 's not a habit , you understand what I 'm saying ? Yeah . Okay , so here 's what 's going down . You 're going to get some help and you 're gonna enroll in a program that 's going to get you off the drugs . And then you 're going to get a job . And then you 're going to get up every morning . And you 're going to go to work . And you 're going to live your life like , you know , a relatively normal human being . - Okay . - No . Just ... I mean , yes , okay , but don 't just say " okay " , okay ? Because this is what 's going to happen , Owen . Or that door 's going to hit you on the ass on the way out , okay ? David . I 'm going to do this . I want to do this . Okay . Okay . Keep it down . Okay ... You want me to go in with you ? Right . Got it . So , new city , new chance . I know it 's cheesy , but it 's true . Thanks . See ya later . - Mayko ? - Right here , Jesus . God . Where 's Harlan 's hard drive ? His lab books . All his stuff ? It was right here when I left yesterday . That 's weird . Oh , no . Thank you for telling me all this . Harlan did some incredible work . It belongs to you now . - What is this ? - That is a patent . For the gene he discovered and a compound that will turn it off . I was working all week with a lawyer friend of mine . He wrangled it through the patent office for you . So , now you can go to Lowy ... on your own terms if you want to . - Could be worth millions . - Or it could hurt so many . Yeah . You 'll have to think about it . Thank you . It 's hard .

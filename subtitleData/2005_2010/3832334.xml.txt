 Big day . Is it ? Trust me . With my life . We 're okay , right ? She 's not going to ... ? Glitch ? She 's fine , Agent Ballard . Sorry , Mr. Ballard . 39 personalities all wiped clean away . If she acts funny , her handler tells me . I just know this one 's been long-term , and today ... Was definitely one for the books . But this is the Dollhouse , frenemy , and nothing happens without my ... What the hell ? What ? Saunders . We 're okay , right ? You 're fine . She 's fine . I 'm gonna go to sleep . Ivy ? Oh , it 's not that bad . It 's the last thing she should be doing . You 're not Echo 's handler , Mr. Langton . You 're head of security now . As head of security , I 'm telling you this engagement poses a risk . Victor . This is coming along well . Thank you . We made a deal with Paul Ballard . Either we honor that deal , or he exposes us , or I order you to do something ... extreme . I 'd like to avoid the latter two . I have plans for the erstwhile agent . You 're touching my face . Move along . He hunted the Dollhouse for months . The Bureau kicks him out and you think that just flips him ? He 's one of us now ? No , I expect he 's looking for something else- - a darker purpose perhaps , or a weakness . And there 's his extreme devotion to Echo . So he uses her to fulfill some sad fantasy about righting old wrongs by doing something worse . Why in particular does this engagement bother you ? You know , after that news anchor- - Which one ? The one who wanted to be rolled in eggs and flour and dipped . Oh , Tempura Joe . Such a lonely soul . I thought I 'd seen it all , but this engagement- - honestly , this one 's sick . Dearly beloved , we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman ... So , do you want to know what I 've been doing while you overslept ? If you tweaked an imprint , I 'll throw you through that window . I 'm just moving things along . We are backed up like LAX at Christmas . It 's the autumn rush . Temperatures plummet to the high 60 's . The leaves fall off that one tree on Wilshire . People need comfort . What 's up with you ? If you little worker bees aren 't too busy , I was promised a treatment . Sierra , nobody called down . I can 't have the other one ? The man one ? I need caffeine . Ivy . I 'm on it . They didn 't change you . I 'm not comfortable with , uh , Orientals . It 'll only take a second . It 's not a racialist issue . It 's just that ... Well , your culture 's not really the thing , is it ? Have a seat . I suppose I 'm at your mercy . In fact , if you were to tie me down and spank me , I could hardly be expected to resist , could I ? I 'll keep that in mind . Yes . How many more today ? Well , the Jonas Brothers are back in town . Say no more . Voracious little nippers . Oh , my God ! Are those from the lab ? I don 't care , just get them ! Okay , okay , okay . That one went there ! Come here , come here . I didn 't know you had a problem with rodents . Well , clearly somebody knew . Oh ... Come here . Is this your idea of a joke ? You designed me , Mr. Brink . I guess it must be your idea of a joke . I designed you to be a not crazy woman ! You 've got to stop messing with me . I don 't seem to be able to . Maybe your work 's not up to par . My work is pristine . If you 're losing it , that 's your fault . Are you sure ? I know what I know . Put the rats back in the maze , Topher , before one of them bites you . You busy ? Just , uh ... dealing with some vermin . Is this about Echo again ? Victor . I didn 't know if you were copied on his results . The scars are practically gone . One more surgery , you 'll never know they were there . Yes , I was surprised that Ms. DeWitt would authorize such an expensive process for an Active . When she didn 't before . There 's no reason she couldn 't do the same for you . I like my scars . They bring out my eyes . Without my scars , I might as well be one of them . And sooner or later , Ms. DeWitt will remember I was a more lucrative asset when I was . There 's no way on earth ... Adelle DeWitt that I would allow it . is not the type of person ... What if she went over your head ? I 'm very tall . Before you knew before either of us knew that I was a fake ... Claire . An Active , a Doll ... When you thought I was just a doctor , you didn 't care much for me . We disagreed about things . Hmm , so should I interpret this new concern as pity ? Curiosity ? Deviant excitement ? There 's no judging in the Dollhouse . You seem to be having a hard time . My entire existence was constructed by a sociopath in a sweater-vest . What do you suggest I do ? Have dinner with me . I think you should get out of here for awhile . And I 'd be glad of the company . I don 't ... go out . I 'm afraid to leave this place . I have a problem with crowds , with people , and sunlight , open spaces , noise , pets . For some reason , I 'm just built that way . Every person I know is pretty poorly constructed . Everyone has an excuse for not dealing . But eventually , that 's all they are- - excuses . Hmm . What 's yours ? This is Hugo . No , the shipment is only delayed a day . Mr. Klar is busy today . Roma Klar . Mrs. Roma Klar . I thought you were keeping your first name . It 's unbelievable . What ? I found the woman of my dreams . You 'll meet her later tonight . She 's lovely . I found the thing that everyone spends their lives thinking they 're going to find , but grieving that they haven 't . She 's in my arms . She 's mine for life . And all I can think is ... I 'm going to step on her feet . I 'm practically paralyzed . We should have taken those lessons . I don 't want us to have a wedding story where I step all over your feet . It 'd relieve the pressure . Seriously , these heels are insane . Take them off . When it 's time . Oh , it 's time . It 's past time . Can I wish everyone away ? No , it 's my wedding day . And I never want it to end ... until my wedding night . # I watched you sleeping # Quietly in my bed # You don 't know this now # But there 's some things that need to be said * # It 's all that I can hear # It 's more than I can bear * # But if I fall and hurt myself * # Would you know how to fix me ? * # If I forgot # Who I am # Would you please remind me ? # Oh , ' cause without you things go hazy . * Hey , partner . Hey . How was last night ? You okay ? I 'm so sore . My feet , perv . Why do people get married in frickin ' stilettos ? Go on . Work for a living . How about Klar ? He said , " I do . " I heard that part . Did you cry ? Little tear , one eye ? Geez , what is with you ? The biggest arms dealer on the coast just plighted his troth to me . For five years , the Bureau couldn 't get his cousin 's dog walker to give them the time of day . Now I 'm the Missus . Five years ago , I still cared about due process . The Bureau 's going to coo like doves when we give them Martin Klar . Then we sneak off into the night . Forget we were ever here . Is this about the sex ? I know , for you , the act of love is the most intimate and precious thing two people can share . But it 's just bodies . It 's useful . And with Klar , it 's pretty damn fun . Man 's got a work ethic . I think you might be a demon . I 'm justice . I 'm blind when I need to be blind . Well , you 're inside now , so open your eyes . I have . This is Martin Klar , okay ? I can 't even get him to tell me where the honeymoon is . There 's not going to be any honeymoon . Wait ... I do this till it 's done . I mean , there 's no movement from suppliers ? All the small arms guys we knew are accounted for or out of the game . I still think Klar is moving something new . Well , we know Pavel Hund is in the market for dirty bombs . Him and Klar were really thick in the ' 90s . That was AKs , not plutonium . Klar wouldn 't touch something that hot . He married me . Paul . How long have we been partners ? Three years . Have I ever said I 'm sure and been wrong ? I 'm guessing not . Trust me . Everything we 've worked for happens now . Not quite yet . Not until you 've had your treatment . Wait . No . A treatment sounds great . I need her . Her protocol says she comes in . Long-term engagements are , um , tricky . Got to check the wiring . And the plumbing . I want Echo back as soon as she 's checked out . Okay . You 're the client . How are you feeling ? A little sleepy . They tell me you had a big night . Who tells you ? You 're going to feel a little pressure . Clean bill of health . Whiskey . Did someone say that to you ? To call me that ? You were number one . Yes . I don 't remember the rest . Alpha cut up my face . Do you remember that ? Why ? So you could be number one . Am I ? You are . I try to be my best . Good for you . You 're done . Go ... be your best . No one is their best in here . What is more precious to a human being than their mind ? Everything we feel , see , everything we are is controlled by our brains . They are the most powerful and delicate part of the human machine . As some of you know , I lost my mother to Alzheimer 's ... years before she died . Since I took office , I have made health care and medical research a top priority , and I call you all here today to tell you I am shocked and appalled by what I have found . There is nothing less than a conspiracy spearheaded by the Rossum Corporation to withhold medical advancements , to use radical illegal ... Well , this is charmless , isn 't it ? What do you think , Mr. Langton ? I like his suit . ... guinea pigs and the public at large like cattle . You may well be missing the point . I am calling for a ... He knows how to wear it , too . Money . A lot . And he was born into it . He 'll have connections . We have connections . He also has ambition . Which he wasn 't born into . Money like that , you either coast or you shoot for the stars . This one isn 't going away . How is it he wasn 't on our radar ? We weren 't on his . I 'm sure he was looking for a cause . Someone gave him us . Recently . Any idea who ? ... of the brain , but these are just ... Mr. Ballard . We were just about to talk about you . Did you see Senator Perrin 's press conference ? Just now . Nice suit . Have you ever talked to Senator Perrin ? Have you ? Mr. Langton ? Miss DeWitt . He reminds me of you . I mean it . If you 're pointing fingers , you should be looking at Boyd . I know why I 'm here . Do you ? I can 't beat you . The FBI kicked me out for trying . Maybe the Senator can , and I 'll raise a glass . But in the meanwhile , I 'm a kiss away from taking down a gunrunner the FBI couldn 't touch . A kiss away ? Echo married him . And my reports put you no closer to closing than you were when their eyes first locked . Are you shutting us down ? I want you to consider becoming Echo 's handler . I don 't work for you . No , you work for the betterment of mankind . Fighting crime by listening to Echo have sex . It 's terribly noble . We don 't have audio inside Klar 's house . You never ask about November . Who ? Mellie . Well , Madeline , actually . But she was Mellie when she was with you . When you used your leverage to have her released instead of Echo , I thought you must have really cared for her . Are you threatening her ? Now I think you were just done with her . But not with Echo . You still need Echo for something . But you 'll never get it ... with the ex strutting about the place . You 're a sick lady . Well , I 'm not asking you to handle me . Echo 's special . You know it . Alpha knew it . She was evolving even before he dumped all her personas into her . Policy would be to send her straight to the Attic , and if this goes too far , I still will . But I 'm a little bit curious . You want to study the rat before you slice it up ? Well , that is how science works . What we learn here feeds Rossum 's crucial research . As much as it feeds their coffers . She hasn 't shown me anything weird . I wouldn 't risk this mission if she had . Echo has three more years on her contract . I would prefer her to have someone in her corner who really cared about her . Even unreasonably . You 're working an angle . With the exception of the very special and the comatose , have you ever met someone who wasn 't ? Think about it . It 'll pass the time during her honeymoon . Hugo , is everything on track with the shipment ? Good . Then tell me what it is you ... Well , if it has to be in person , it can wait until the morning . It can absolutely wait until the morning . I 'll call you . You were gone too long . You won 't tell me where we 're going , so I had to buy one of everything . Well , supper 's laid out . Are you hungry ? Are you ? Ten seconds ago , I swear I was . I think you 're controlling my thoughts . It 's easier than you 'd think . Women . Mmm ... What the ... ? ! What the hell ? ! Are you drunk ? I 'm just trying to be my best . Oh , whoa , I-I-I don 't want your best . Well , I think you do ... Okay , that is the minority vote . And you tricked it . Okay ? A guy 's asleep . Could have been Fozzie Bear and it would have ... Not that I think about Fozzie Bear . Let 's stop playing games . Okay , how does this qualify as not playing games ? Because this is the endgame . This is where it all leads . You design someone to hate you so you can convince them to love you . Hey , I could whip up a love slave any day I wanted to . But that wouldn 't be a challenge , would it ? Slaves are just slaves . But winning over your enemy- - the one person guaranteed to reject everything you are- - that 's real love . More real than anything up in the world . And I understand it now . I love you . I love you . You need a frickin ' treatment ! Why shouldn 't I love you ? Aren 't you lovable ? Aren 't you Big Brother ? Aren 't you the Lord my God ? Why should I fight your divine plan ? 'Cause you 're better than that ! Because you 're better than me . Dr. Saunders was dead . And Whiskey was out of service , at least temporarily . So DeWitt gave me the call . " We need a new doctor . " One who 's committed to our cause , who 's kind and efficient and will look after our Actives . " So why didn 't you stop there ? Because I was designing a person , not a Roomba . I needed you to be whole . If you agreed with everything I said , then we would miss something , and someone would get hurt . You don 't care if people get hurt . You don 't know me ! That 's the contract . You don 't know me , and I don 't know you . Not fully , not ever . I made you question . I made you fight for your beliefs . I didn 't make you hate me ... You chose to . How do I live ? How do I go through my day knowing everything I think comes from something I can 't abide ? So you aren 't really gonna sleep with me . I can 't stand the smell of you . I did that so we never ... Why didn 't you find out who you really used to be ? You had your chance . Maybe DeWitt would even re-imprint your old identity . You 've earned it . Because I don 't want to die . I 'm not even real . I 'm in someone else 's body , and I 'm afraid to give it up . I 'm not better than you . I 'm just a series of excuses . You 're human . Don 't flatter yourself . Martin ? Honey ? That desk was my grandfather 's . I know . So I 'd prefer if you didn 't stab it to death . No , I just ... This is your fault . I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm all ears . You know I can 't stand surprises . You have to tell me where we 're going . Half the fun of a honeymoon is packing and ... Well , maybe not half . Wait . You say this from experience ? From your many marriages ? What 's up ? What , besides you assaulting a family heirloom ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't leave a scratch . It 's all right . Don 't worry . I can always have it refinished . Martin ... What , no self-defense training ? No second gun in the ankle holster ? Please ... I can 't believe he 'd leave you here without any kind of defense . I don 't know what you 're talking about ! Do you take this man to be your lawfully-wedded husband ? Martin , I love you . To love and honor , in sickness and in health so long as you both shall live ? I do ! Who are you ? ! My name is Roma Klar . Yes , it is . It 's comical . It is , I understand , the key to comedy- - the , um , timing . One day , one day wed , and I get this ! Proof that my wife is my enemy . Paul Ballard ... Where did he find you ? Huh ? I mean , you 're not Bureau . Uh , Witness Protection ? Starving actress ? What did he promise you ? Is he your lover ? I 've never seen this man . This is a photo ! Have you see this man , darling ? ! It 's fake ! It 's Photoshopped ! Or this guy , he asked me for the time and had someone snap a picture . Why ? To hurt you ! He 's your enemy . He comes at what 's closest to you ! Well , good for him ! I thought you were gentle and honest . He knew better , you wife-beating piece of ... Listen ... Don 't touch me ! Roma ! Roma , Roma ... I 'm sorry . Who has enemies like that ? Who the hell are you that people hate you that much ? I 'm not stupid . Martin , I know you 're not just a frickin ' financier , but I don 't care ! I didn 't marry your job ! I married you . I can 't be wrong about you . Look at me . Just forget everything and look at me . I am your wife . For the rest of my life ... I am and will always be Mrs. Eleanor Penn . Wait . Who did they make me this time ? They 're lovely , aren 't they ? Of course , they 're just little bombs . But they 're not actually dirty bombs until you 've inserted them inside the plutonium . But then they 're just ordinary looking . I like the heart of the thing . The mechanism , the light from within . That 's why I loved you . I never lied to you ... not about anything that mattered . It 's Ballard . Let me talk to Topher Brink . Uh , okay . Please hold . This is Topher . What up ? Something 's not right . With Echo ? Her handler said she spiked about two hours back . Can you access that ? I can , I am . Why didn 't he move in ? He said it was excitement . They were being newlyweds . Yeah , that 's not hot monkey love . I got zero serotonin . Theta activities to the CA1 are peaking . That was pain , and panic . How did he miss this ? What do you see now ? She 's amped , but there 's drop-offs . It 's kind of random . She could be concussed . I 'm calling it . You move in now , Klar will kill her for sure . You got a better plan ? No , but I do have a much worse one . Sir . My God , this is becoming surreal . Bring her out . Well , it 's Paul Ballard . Special agent in charge of bugger all . Hello , Martin . Have you come to wish us joy on our nuptials ? Let her go . But we 're very much in love . You don 't know who you 're dealing with here . Well , I know it 's not the FBI . I think I 'm going to keep this gun . I 'm going to treasure it . You 're making a mistake . Oh , well , you 're the expert in that field . Did he tell you he was still with the FBI ? Not ousted in disgrace ? Did he forget to mention his pathetic failed attempts to catch me , or anyone ? I 'm just so anxious to know what he said that put you in bed with a man who represents everything that he will never be . What ? I don 't understand anything you 're saying . Where 's Donny ? Oh , Roma , love , it 's the wrong act . It 's not an act . God , my head is on fire . Be a dream and bring Mommy a Vicodin ... Okay , I 'm starting to feel like maybe she 's not taking this seriously . She doesn 't get what 's happening . The pressure or something . She cracked . You couldn 't take it . This is the man from the picture . Martin , I don 't know him . Just give it up . Your name is Caroline . You don 't ... I would never hurt you . I bet everything on you . I traded my life for this , and you couldn 't even ... Paul . All you had to do was remember who you were . You can 't remember ? Nobody home ? We 're going to die , and this scumbag is going to walk because of you . The Chinese restaurant- - you remember that ! Whoever you think you are ... I swear , I don 't want to hurt you . I know . I 'm counting on it . Get the plane started . Echo ! Roma ! Let 's go , sweetie . it 's over . It 's all over the news . Arms deal gone wrong . Your friend 's plane was nabbed . So was he . You got your man . She got him . Well , she wouldn 't have if you hadn 't seen what her handler failed to . Topher said her readings were all over the place . Yeah , well , concussion . Did I fall asleep ? For a little while . # The world is all around us # It 's much too big to see # And the words are seldom honest # So we never disagree # Oh , the world is all around us # But have you noticed me ? # Yeah , the world has overshadowed me # The world is all around us # So tell me what you see # Yeah , the world is all around us # There 's little room to breathe ... # Hey . Hello . I 'm sorry . I , uh ... well , I guess I wasn 't exactly my best . I 'm trying to do what 's right . And I 'm having a harder and harder time figuring out what that even means . And maybe I should have gotten you out of here first thing . Instead I put you through ... Well , I know you don 't remember it , but ... I remember everything . Sometimes I 'm someone else . And then I come back , but I still feel them ... all of them . I 've been many people . I can hear them . Sometimes suddenly . I 'm all of them , but none of them is me ? Do you know who 's real ? Caroline . I want to find her . I want to find all of them . Real them . They can be found . We are lost ... but we are not gone . Will you help me ? I swear , no matter what , I 'm with you . Everything 's going to be all right . Now that you 're here . Do you trust me ? With my life .

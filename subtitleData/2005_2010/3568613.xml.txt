Shined shoes . And then i discovered I could control the very earth under my feet , And i was liberated . I could be filthy . [ laughs ] Tie still feels like a damn noose around my neck . - come here . You don 't have to leave . You know , i could ... i could do whatever you want . - no. thank you . It 's my responsibility . Ever since joseph died , i feel like the lights ... Don 't shine as bright in here . Feel like i 'm missing a part of myself . He was my compass . I 'm afraid of where we 're going without it . I need it back . - i 'm sorry for your loss . But you know you cannot replace your brother . - no , you don 't understand . We have a need , and i have a candidate . I just want to see If he deserves a place at our table . - do you think that you might go home While you 're out there ? - no. i left that life .

Which is you need to figure out how to undo what you did . Give me back my body , and i will be happy ... To leave you stewing in your mediocrity . - you 're a killer . i 'm a cop . If i have to keep you trapped inside this prison For the rest of my life ... So be it . - you really think you 're up to the challenge ? - you got no power. none . You 're annoying as hell , yes , but ultimately ... harmless . I can just ignore you until you fade away Like a bad memory . - we 'll see . - we got the warrant . - good . - i want you on this job . But you 're not going into that house Until i know that you 'll keep it together . - i 'm fine . look . Huh ? It 's the first day of the rest of my life ... right ?

You 're just gonna avoid me ? - i 'm not . - wow. you 're even gonna avoid admitting you 're avoiding me . - no , no , no , i 'm not . I was just busy and- - and studying and ... Organic chem is a bitch . How 's , uh , art history ? - so we 're really not gonna talk about this ? - look ... whatever it is You thought you saw the other night , You didn 't see . - i didn 't see you hurl yourself out a window And then snap your bones back into place ? - no ! No ! I mean , yes , i was- - i was on the ground And i was testing your theory , you know , jump , push , fall , And i think annie did commit suicide , Which is awful and--and tragic . - you don 't have to lie to me . - look , you were wrong about annie Just like you 're wrong about me . - seriously , what are you ... a vampire , an alien ? Some kind of freakish government experiment ? - all right . i just have to change . - hi , mr. bennet . - who 's your friend ? - oh , that 's , uh , gretchen . - nice to meet you . - yeah , um ...

He 's in physical therapy right now . Thank you . 'scuse me . william hooper ? - yes ? that 's me . - i think there 's been a mistake . I 've never met you before . - there 's no mistake , mr. petrelli . You pulled me from the 424 bus After it crashed at lexington and 53rd . I remember you were fast , so fast , So negligent , you dislocated my arm . - well , i remember everybody that was on that bus . You weren 't on it . What is this , a scam ? you recognize my family name ? You want money ? - i 'm not scamming you . don 't need your cash . - then what ? - empathy . I 'm in town because of my brother joseph . He died and ... There 's a lot of loose ends to take care of When someone passes . I 'm all alone now . I have to take care of our entire family . It 's my responsibility . it 's my burden . But i can 't do that on account of you . Doctor says i won 't work for months . If i don 't work , i don 't feed my family . Are you the kinda man That 's going to allow my family to starve ? - you know what ? this was a mistake . I 'm gonna let the lawyers handle it--good day . - working two , three shifts at a time . My lawyer already checked on you . I know what it 's like to feel the pressure of obligation . But isn 't it possible i was on that bus And you 've become so spread thin that you ... Forgot ? - no. it 's not . - you 're not going blind , emma . There 's nothing wrong with your eyes . When you saw the lights , did other people see them ? Did you ever hear of synesthesia ? Yeah , yeah . People say that they can smell words Or hear numbers . It 's possible . it 's very common in deaf cases . Maybe your body 's trying to tell you something . Emma , emma . this is serious . You know , you are completely disengaged . You file records when you could be treating patients . Is that why you wear the headphones ? - hey ! I don 't want to see their faces . - okay. we 've got saag paneer . Baingan bharta . Aloo gobi . Tikka masala . - seriously ?

Could you bring that out , please ? - clever. you 're very good at hiding things . - so , gretchen , what 's your major ? - physiology and biomechanics . - i thought it was art history . - i 'm gonna change . I 'm obsessed with the abilities of the human body . The other day i saw this girl ... On youtube . She was born with this gene That doesn 't let her feel any pain , like nothing . And her parents are freaked that she could cut her hand Or burn herself and not even know . So she 's totally cloistered . Pretty cool , huh ? - it 's unusual , to say the least . - so , what do you think , claire ? Wanna audit some of these classes with me ? - what do you think , claire ? - why would i be interested in that ? - because it 's awesome , we could do it together , And you 're still undeclared . - well , i can be undeclared till , uh , third year . - yeah , but that 's just like denying the inevitable . How long can you do that for ? - you know , this yellow is really good . Yummy yellow . - so , mr. bennet , what do you do ? - retired . But i 'm always finding new reasons to go back to work . - whose do you think this is ? I mean , it 's not his daughter . Would you let your kid play here ?

Come on , whose stuffed animal is that ? Is there a kid here ? tell me . Hey ! Right . you 're ignoring me now ? - doesn 't feel very good , does it ? Somebody has something you want , And they just won 't give it to you . - i never intended for this to happen . - unless you did , mr. parkman . - what the hell 's that supposed to me ? - your life 's a mess , matt . I 'm stuck inside your mind with your powers And all your anxieties . It 's sad . You 're so desperate for anyone to love you- - I mean janice or your kid . And they never will love you . and you wanna know why ? - shut up ! - i didn 't say anything , man ! - because you come in at a zero on the confidence scale . You 're always second-guessing yourself . - listen , i 'm innocent ! - sweating every decision you make--literally . - i swear ! - you know what i think ? I think you wanted me in here to help you . You wanted me to pick your sorry ass up out of the mud And help make you a man . Very good , detective . You found it all on your own . I 'm almost impressed . Now what are you gonna do , matt ? Are you man enough to save her ? You were right , mr. bennet . This was outstanding . thank you . - you 're welcome . - that mango lassi just goes right through you . Excuse me . - okay , look- - - i know things are difficult , But i can 't believe you told her about your ability . - i didn 't tell her ! she just found out . - i gotta contact the haitian . erase gretchen 's memory . Clean this mess up . - hey ! gretchen is not the enemy . She 's just a girl , And she 's the only friend that i 've made . I appreciate your concern , But i don 't need you fighting my battles for me . I can handle this . - really ? what 's your plan , claire ? - stop . You make that phone call , And i swear i will banish you . I will not call . i will not email . This is my mess , and i 'm gonna clean it up . - so ... What 's for dessert ? - where is she ? - what are you talking about ? - this is what i 'm talking about , The girl you wrote the ransom note for . Where is she ? - there is no girl . - little girl 's life at stake , parkman . You don 't have a lot of time . Use your power . Use your power . [ echoing voice ] under the stairs ... She 's under ... she 's under the stairs . - what did you do ? what did you do ! - what ? dude , what are you doing ? - parkman ! parkman , what the hell are you doing ? - a girl . he killed a girl . Her body 's under the stairs . - what girl ? - the girl ! The girl 's body , mike . she 's right- - What- - The stuffed rabbit . where 's the stuffed- - Pink stuffed- - - what ? - i used your own power ... against you . - you 're being sued ? - this is a scam . This guy wasn 't even in that bus crash . - according to my log , he was . The hospital is not gonna take the fall on this . They 're gonna blame you . - for what ? i 've been nothing but committed . - yeah , i know . you 're everywhere . Always the first on scene . - what 's that supposed to mean ? - there 's a couple of people floating the theory That you cause the accidents yourself . Glory hounding . - so what , you- - you believe them ? - they ask if you 've been reckless , They ask if you 've been behaving suspiciously . You have . - hesam , you know me . We 're partners . - partners ? Man , you run off the second we get on scene . I 'm your chauffeur . - hmph . [ clicking ] He was on the bus . - look , claire , i 'm sorry if i push too hard . I push . i 'm pushy . - ya think ? - you don 't want to talk . i get that . Wanted to keep a secret that got out . [ sighs ] When i was in junior high , The girls called me retching ' gretchen . - that 's a terrible nickname . - yeah , they said that i smelled like puke Because i was bulimic . - wow. i can 't believe they would make that up . - yeah . made it up . [ laughs ] I 'll see you around . - gretchen . I really , really want to trust you , But my life has been a complex series of disasters , And ... it 's been a really , really long time Since i felt safe enough to tell anyone the truth . But i 'm tired of keeping the secret to myself . So ask me anything . I 'll tell you the truth . - mr. petrelli . didn 't expect to see you again . You look like you 've been running all over the city . - i need to apologize to you . You were on that bus . I made a mistake , and i am sorry . - thank you . - i 'm gonna make it right . - no need to concern yourself . - there must be something i can do . - have you ever lost a brother ? - no. no , i haven 't . I used to work hospice . I used to help families through the worst pain imaginable . - joseph and i grew up nearby . I thought i 'd go back home To remember the good times . - can 't bring yourself to go ? - too many bad memories mixed in with the good . My trip here started as one thing , But it turned into something else . [ sighs ] Can 't seem to find any solace anywhere . - grieving is ... messy . I saw it all the time . People can offer their condolences . They can tell you they 're sorry for your loss , But they don 't ... know what it is that you 're feeling . - what do you say to people ? - i just sit with them , Be with them . I 'd let ' em know that they 're not alone . - so what made you become a paramedic ? - i wanted to save lives instead of watching them pass . - you 're exactly who i 'd hoped you 'd be . I 'm dropping the lawsuit . Thank you , peter , for everything . - you know , it 's not for nothing , but if you ... Made the trip all the way out here , I really think that you should visit your home . - i think i will . [ somber cello music ] [ bass notes ] [ melodic music ] [ melody continues ] - sorry to bother you at this hour , But , um ... I grew up here . My father used to be the butler . My mother was the maid . My brother , uh , recently passed away , And , uh ... i just ... Thought i could take a look around . Not here , but in the carriage house . - we 're actually in the middle of a dinner party . - please . - this really is not a good time . Sorry for your loss . [ giggling ] - so wait , you 're telling me that you 've never been drunk ? Because that 's like 85 % of the college experience . - i know . it just doesn 't work on me . I heal too quickly . But the good thing is You will always have a designated driver . - [ giggles ] Can i ... see it ? - see what ? The healing ? - if that 's not crossing a line . [ death cab for cutie 's grapevine fires plays ] - the hand 's always the favorite . Go for it . - i 've never done this before . - well , i would hope not . - [ chuckling ] - it 's okay . - aah ! - oh , my god , oh , my god ! I 'm so sorry ! are you okay ? - i 'm just kidding . i 'm sorry . [ laughs ] That was mean . i 'm fine . - i have to take this . [ ringing ] I 'll be right back . [ cell phone ringing ] Dad , i 've got everything under control , okay ? And i told gretchen everything about everything , And i know that you 're gonna be mad . But this was my choice . It 's not just us anymore , And i 'm gonna have other people in my life , Friends and boyfriends , And i can 't close myself off with lies . - did you rehearse that speech ? - yes . I wanted to get it right . - no , it--it was good . listen , i , um ... I think i owe you an apology . I was a bit harsh earlier at the restaurant . - a bit ? - okay. two bits . It 's just ... When i look at you , I can 't help seeing my claire bear , and , uh ... When you get in any kind of trouble , I feel this instinct to protect you . - well , you can 't do that now . - i don 't think i can ever really do it again . Not like before . Look , i will always be here for you . Always . But ... you 're right . You can handle your own problems now . And i 'll try to worry about myself from now on . - thanks . Good night , dad . - good night , claire . Good night . - [ chuckles ] can i , uh , borrow this ? - no . - right. sorry . - no , i--i mean yes . Yes , but ... Well , you won 't have to borrow it because ... It 'll be here . Do you want to be my roommate ? - [ laughs ] Let me think , um ... Rooming with a boring girl who smells like pickles , Or the supergirl who 's got excellent taste in literature . - well , all right then . Roomie . - i just ... i don 't see any other way out of this . You crossed the line , man . - what 's gonna happen to me , mike ? - you need to find yourself a damn good lawyer . - this is gonna ruin my life . - i am sorry . - yeah . Me too . - what are you doing ? - i guess i 'm just not strong enough anymore . [ thinking ] nothing happened here . He attacked you . i stopped him . That 's all . go call it in . - i 'll go call it in , matt . - i 'm proud of you . You 're finally becoming more like me . Today is ... The first day of the rest of your life . [ ominous music ] Now , they can all be like this ... Or you and i can go find my body . [ police radio chatter ] [ siren wails ] - weird , huh . - sorry to make you boys come out . Three people died here . could have been a lot worse . - so what happened ? - sinkhole . - sinkhole ? - [ grunting ] Ah !

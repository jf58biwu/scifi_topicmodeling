 I remember that hot , wonderful summer ... when the teenage miracle reached full bloom ... and everyone in England stopped what they were doing ... to stare at what had happened . The Soho nights were cool in the heat ... with light and music in the streets . And we couldn 't believe that this was really coming to us at last . Nobody knew exactly why . But after so many dreary years of bombs and blitz and slow rebuilding ... no sugar , no jam , nothing sweet anywhere ... with the whole English world dressed in gray , it seemed , forever . Suddenly life broke out in warm colors again ... so young and beautiful that a lot of people couldn 't stand to look at it . For the first time ever , kids were teenagers . We had loot , however come by . And loot 's for spending . And where there 's loot , trouble follows . During my last teenage year , I kept myself by taking photographs . Naughty pictures for profit . And solid street pictures for love . So that when the blossom went off , and the flower turned to plastic ... me and my friends could remember how it looked . Money for looks . Money for film . But most of all , money for Suzette . My beautiful Crepe Suzette . Don 't be late , Colin . - What , no trousers , Ken ? - That " s fine with me . Yeah , this is England . Go back home . Come on . Is this enough ? All right . Fifty quid . But that " s for two of you , right ? - Where to , girls ? - Mandy " s house . You bitches , where are you going ? It was England all right , but very un-English . Every class , every income , every kink . Boys , girls , black , white , yellow , bent , versatile ... all on equal terms . - Hey , Joe , we got us some fun ! - All right . Let " s have a night on the town , baby . What a big boy . You naughty child . Leave off . Take it easy . Bloody teenagers . True , sometimes a knife came out . But that was always between friends . You behave yourself , you 're all right here . It 's not in Soho where some sex maniac leaps on your back and violates you . That 's strictly for the respectable neighborhoods . All right then , come on , I " ve got half an hour to kill . Me and my pals are regulars down here . Every night the same old young faces . The Wizard . Wiz , a real child of the pavements . Baby face like a mask over his 2,000-year-old soul . A colored cat named Cool . So cool for reasons too obvious to mention . Fabulous Hoplite . Our own low-rent Oscar Wilde ... and a very well-connected boy . Dean Swift . A sharp modern jazz creation . Expensive habit . No bread . Big Jill . Hiya , big boy . Give us a flash . Chicks only for Big Jill . But a boy 's best friend anyway . Christ . Midnight . Hey , Nobody . Open up . Just doesn 't do to be late for a girl like Suzette . - Hi , doll . - Hi , hon . You nearly lost me there . Cool , honey . Hold this . Mods ! Yum-yum . Crepe Suzette . Nice enough to eat . Careful , Wizard . Dorita , can I walk you home ? The streets have eyes , Cool . And my mom and dad would kill me . Why roll the dice , if you didn " t want to bet ? It " s one thing in there , but it " s different out here . - L " ve gotta go . - Taxi ! Come on , Suze . Come on , it " s not that late . Your place or mine ? Some of us have to work for a living . I have to be at Henley " s show tomorrow morning . Why do you work for that creep , hon ? He " s just using you . You could take your designs anywhere . I " m using him , too . I may even get to Paris this year . - Paris , France ? - Colin . He could help you , too , if you " d let him . You could take pictures of my designs . We " d work together . I told you , I " m not taking pics of high-class tarts wearing your silly hats . And certainly not Henley " s glad rags . Sorry , I forgot . You " re taking all those pics for your exhibition . Right ! The one you " re having in your wildest dreams . Taxi . - Hold it ! Taxi ! - Go on , get out of here . You should be at school in a few hours time , you ratty little sod . Take me there . Let me in . Come on , let me in . Look , I found another client for you . Harold Charms , the pop mogul ? He could easily find his own dirty postcards . You " ll do it . You " re down to your last pair of mock crocs . And you promised to take me to dinner tomorrow night . - Money isn " t everything . - I know . It " ll do until everything comes along . Help ! Somebody ! Stop ! Please , stop ! They " ve got knives ! Don " t get involved , Colin . Let " s get out of here . Taxi . Over here . I need my beauty sleep . Bayswater . Last chance , Colin . See you after the show tomorrow , all right ? And don " t be late . Last chance . She means business , all right . I couldn 't even afford a down payment . Anyway , you don 't get a girl like Suzette on the never-never . It 's not that I 've got anything against money . It 's just what you have to do to get it . Still , there 's always tomorrow . At least there 's other Casanovas in the same boat . Napoli , the land that time forgot . We always came home with the night shift . Now you might say : " If you 're so cute , kiddo , how come you live in a disaster area like this ? " Well , for one thing , as you might imagine , it 's cheap . Cash to the landlord once a week ... but otherwise , goods circulating on a more or less informal basis . I saw that . But the thing I love most about these streets ... was the thing that made some people positively hate them . Because here , nobody cared where you came from or what color ... what you did , or who you did it with . Unfortunately , it wasn 't exactly Suzette 's idea of a desirable address ... which is why I 've never brought her home . - Catch . - How " s that ? Come on ! You owe me two months " rent . I " m not going until I " ve got it . You can " t charge rent for that , Saltzman . You need to put a roof on it first . - Ciao . - Buon giorno . - Hiya , Big Jill . - Hiya , lady killer . Oh , Napoli , Napoli , Napoli Not the one in Italy ! Come on , darling . Home . Sweet and sour home . People often ask me how I became dressmaker to the Queen . My answer is always that I owe it all to my wonderful clientele . And I can only hope that you kind ladies ... will grace our latest collection with your favor . Ladies and gentlemen , I give you Henley 's new Elizabethan collection . Opening with a selection of costumes de baigneuse ... with a touch of rococo ... in aquamarine ... bleute , and nuit ... decorated with cerulean oysters ... pearled fish , scallop shells ... and shimmering starfish . Guaranteed to sink any passing ship . And for evening wear , our shell and mermaid creations ... in crepuscule and turquoise ... and inlaid with over 18,000 Majorcan pearls . And for the more daring among you ... our latest bikini styles in oyster and coral motifs . Henley , you have got to be kidding . I mean , you are not seriously going to show these gowns in Paris . Honey , they will laugh you off the stage . And , Henley , hemlines can " t come down . They " ve got to go up . Dido , there " s nothing worse than the back of a woman " s knees . They remind me of uncooked rock cakes . - Help me ! - Oh , God , Suzette . Colin . I said I wouldn 't do this . And here I am doing it . A few painless shots , and I can pay for dinner . That 's what I call integrity . But you " ve never heard it like this , Mr. Charms . It " s a sure-fire hit . Just look at these fame-starved urchins ... putting on the agony , all trying to sing like hillbillies ... just praying for Harry Charms to snap them up ... and sell them into pop slavery . I mustn 't throw stones , especially not at Americans . Yanks invented teenagers . England for the English , and all that . But being anti-Yank 's a sure sign of defeat . I " ve got the tickets for the Stravinsky recital . - Harry Charms , I " ve got an appointment . - He " s in there . Do me a favor , don " t drive me mad down there . He was precious , all right . Loonies . And very nasty in the wrong hands . Listen . You know the three most useless things in the world ? The pope " s balls , a nun " s tits and a good write-up in The Record Mirror . Harry Charms ? - Who are you ? - My name " s Colin . Sonya , how many times must I tell you ... Suzette sent me . I " ve come about the dirty pictures . Dirty pictures ? No . Where " d she get that idea from ? Do you mind ? This is the Harry Charms Stable of Stars . Each one a star in their own right . Come and sit down . No , over here . Whitey Britain , Charles Harold , Zesty Boy Swift ... all my own discoveries . And over here ... at least one more , maybe two . They don " t know it yet . Neither do I , for sure . Right , come in here and have a look . All right , settle down , everybody . All right , stars ? Right . It " s not just their talent , you see , it " s mine . Look at this . Stand up . No , not you , you . No , not right . Who else ? You , let " s have a look at you . I " m a great drummer . Too many cream buns . Naming them , taming them , famousing them up . - He " s very musical . He " s a great mover ... - Leave it out , Mom . You could be right . Colin , I " ve got a new song . With your help ... I " m gonna make it a hit . Well , there 's gonna be some changes What a mover . Around the garbage can Get a shot , Colin , get a shot . When you lean , lean right forward . That " s good , baby . It " s a hit . We " ve got a hit . I can feel it . I may look like a little kitten That " s good . Give it to us , baby . Boom it out . Look out , Big Cat , Little Cat 's moving in Now move your hips . Move your hips forward , back . Now twirl them around . Come on , baby , boom it out ! Sing it , baby . Baby , boom it ! Baby Boom ! Baby Boom ! That " s it ! Get a shot of Baby Boom . Come on , Suzette , I need to go . I " ll pin you underneath . Oh , God , I " m caught ! - Stop , Camilla . Stop . - Get off . Will you get off ? Henley , you " ve been holding out on me , you rascal , you . Watch it , will you ? I love this look . What do you call it ? This is one of yours ? I " ll bloody well get you for this ! There she is ! Her ! Bravo , bravo . Get her . Henley , you " re a genius . Get this . I " ll bloody well get you for this . - It " s a very exclusive club . - I had it . What seems to be the problem ? Look out . What are you doing ? I don " t think she " d appreciate your presence here right now . - Come on . - What " s that supposed to mean ? Come on , boys ! Look at that ! Disgraceful ! Fantastic ! Henley ! Henley ! Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . You have witnessed an historic event ... the birth of Henley " s Young Idea . Bravo . Darling , I didn " t know you were so talented . Let " s talk about it over dinner . A friend and I were going to eat . The Paris collections start next week . I know a lot of people who " d like to get acquainted with you , design-wise . Would you like to meet Yves ? Christian ? I " d love to . I " ve got whores ! Anybody want a whore ? Out of the way . Watch out . Thank you . Young men and young women . Two coffee-coffees coming up . Can " t you two get a room ? Move it ! I will tell the whole truth , and others will continue what I have begun . I am like Zola ... I " m in a trance ! I 'm your boy , Suze . Forever and ever . Scram . - Hi , Colin . - Hi , hon . I don " t believe it . How come you " re not late ? I made sure . Listen . I can " t make dinner tonight . I " ve got to work . Don " t be like that . - Why didn " t you turn up ? - I did turn up . - You didn " t . - I did . Ask your Uncle Henley . He knows all about it . I even did the Harry Charms shots for you . Don " t worry about it , Colin . Stay on here in the Land of Oz ... with the Wizard and all those other creepy pals of yours . You " ll never need to know . I " ve gotta go . You ask me what I want when I thought I 'd made it clear Although I won 't stop loving you you can never have me near Don 't blame me I never asked you to fall No one 's gonna stop me from having it all Having it all You 'll never stop me from having it all Having it all , having it all You 'll never stop me from having Having it all Having it all , having it all You 'll never stop me from having it all You 've got to accept , I 'm no ordinary girl And I 'll never fit in your perfect little world Don 't take it lightly Baby , I 'm not bluffing To get what I want I 'll stop at nothing Having it all , having it all You 'll never stop me from having it all Having it all , having it all You 'll never stop me My reasons are simple , so don 't ask me why I 'll never forget you Good bye The days really drag by when it 's hot . No Suzette to make the time fly . Five days without her . It seemed like a year . Back to the old ancestral seat . I still have my darkroom . Down in dreary Pimlico , where my parents live . If you can call it living . Hello , Ma . Hello , blitz-baby . What are you doing in my darkroom , Jules ? My name " s Vern , ain " t it ? Moron . So why do you keep calling me Jules ? Come in . Hello , Dad . I tried to stop him moving in . - Been misbehaving with the lodgers again . - Bloody wogs . Thanks , Dad . How " s the photo album going ? All right . Here , have a go at those . You " re not still on the poor old 1930s , surely . It was a terrible time to be young . Poverty . Unemployment . No light at the end of the corridor . - It " s better now , even with the bomb . - Hold it a minute . We may do this . Should " ve had my youth along with all these drip-dry shirts and Sputniks ... not like then . Dad , you " re toughening it up a little . Looks like you and Ma had a good time in these . My wedding day . I remember it like it was yesterday . I wish it was tomorrow , then I " d cancel it . It " s not that bad . You should get out more often . Why do you hang around this dump ? " Cause the dump has to look respectable . She keeps him here . Ignore him , Dad . He " s nothing to do with me . And keep him away from my pictures . And don " t remind me , splattered all over the ceiling in the morning . You really are a horror . A real unidentified slob from outer space . Is that a fact ? Well , you " re a traitor to the working class . Well , Suze , that 's the way it goes . If you could see my weirdo family , you 'd never have to ask why I left home . Poor Dad , sweetest bloke you 'd ever want to meet ... locked up with his prewar photo album and his sad memories . Mom trying to keep her looks , always carrying on with the lodgers . Half-brother Vern , born middle-aged , thick as two bricks ... and you wouldn 't even want to imagine what he gets up to . If this is adult life , I think I 'll stay an absolute beginner forever . Something 's happening , but I 'm just gonna turn a blind eye If I see no evil I ask no questions and I hear no lies Get them down to the kitchen and wash them . Can 't communicate with minds that are small With some people it 's like talking to the wall And the fella who walks away lives to battle another day And I 've really got no appetite for a fight Sign here , governor . Not tonight - What the hell is going on in there ? - Coming , Mom . All I want is a quiet life Anything for a quiet life No ambition to rock the boat When I can just stay afloat And be content with a quiet life All I want is a quiet life Anything for a quiet life Here , wash these . Hear no evil , see no evil , speak no evil at all You naughty boy . Confidentially , between these walls I 'm on top of it all I 'd rather have ' em think I 'm deaf , dumb and blind than aggravation every time I speak my mind Keep spooning ' , have a quiet life What , you lazy sod , what you doing in here , anyway ? Get upstairs and vacuum the carpets . Panty , bra . Cin-cin . I could easily blow my top Hello , Dad . Start a row , but why start now ?

So I hear . - Hey , Cool ? - Yeah ? Couldn " t lend me a quid , could you ? Crazy , man . What " re you doing ? Over here . Take all this crap furniture and all your little schwartzes and piss off out of it . You know , there " s something odd around these parts . What else is new ? All the other families are moving out or being moved out ... which , to my mind , means somebody else is moving in . Who the hell " d wanna move in around here ? Trouble . It " s only your kid sister . Hey , Cool , I know you was rolling dice last night ... and I " m gonna tell Mama on you , Mr. " I " m Cool " Cool . I " ll tell Dad as well , and it " ll mean big trouble . See you later , Cool . God , I love this city . And I never wanna leave it . 'Cause though it seems so hard and untidy ... if you get to know it well ... if you 're its son , it 's always on your side , come what may . That 's what I imagined , anyway . Hello , bad boy . Why are you pounding around down here ? I " ve moved down here . My God , it talks . And why " s it moved down here ? " Cause I moved in with me gran . She lives here . Anyways , I live where I like . It " s a free country , isn " t it ? Face it , Ed , you old-style Edwardians have been put to pasture in the provinces ... where , no doubt , you " ll live forever . But down here , Ted is definitely dead . Never . You " re an old man , and only last week a snot-nosed little kid . Watch it . Your problem was never being a teenager in between . Teenagers ? Get out of here . That " s kid " s stuff . Drown the lot of them . If you say so , sucker . Yank ! Go home , Yank ! And take Sambo with you . - Are you all right , Colin ? - What " s going down ?

I " m your boy , Vendice . For most of the summer , then , Suze and I only saw each other in the smart magazines . At least she could follow my meteoric career as a professional teenager . She must 've known I was only doing it for her ... so she wouldn 't have to slip into that world completely alone . " From now on , " I said , " I 'm gonna be a tough nut and a very practical boy . " My exhibition could wait . It 's funny . Once you make up your mind to let go and sell out , it 's one damn check after another . Money at the best time to have it , when you 're young and strong . Money to catch Suzette when she falls . And she 's gonna fall . Wait and see . And as for photography ... it isn 't exactly difficult , is it ? Right . Hands on the handlebars , Dean , and turn away from me . Hands on the handlebars , and turn around to profile . That " s it , just hold it there . That " s great , Dean .

Wet dreams , Wiz . Risky . Seedy . No class . You could keep it clean and unreal , look , like me . That " s a bit rich coming from a kid I " ve known for flogging dirty pictures . I was just in that kick for giggles . I " ve moved on . I knew you " d go up in the world once you got rid of that girl . Or did she get rid of you ? You wouldn " t understand . Motivation , that " s what you need . Self-motivation . She " s jailbait , and you " re the one who " ll end up inside . Can you imagine me in a court ? Who " ll believe a baby face like me could be in this racket ? If you could see yourself now , you " d realize you don " t look young at all . You just look old . Old and used . It " s an old business , isn " t it ? If the cowboys catch me , you " ll have money to bail me out ... you " re so flash . Don " t be so sure . You " ll come running . You adore me . Happy honeymoon ! Move out . Say hello to the TV cameras for me . You " re going now , then ? - Gimme a break . - See you later at Chez Nobody " s . Adios , bambino . Adios ! Two . One . Cue , Cobber . Hi there , pop pickers . Tonight , the teenage phenomenon . I have with me in the studio Amberly Drove ... Conservative member for Beckensfield and a former headmaster . Top pop picker Harry Charms . Hello there , pop fans . Nice to see you . We have that delightful lady newshound all the way from the US of A ... Dido Lament . Hello . And last but not least , Colin . Don " t he look good ? He 's a teenager who 's really going places . Ladies and gentlemen , teenagers , let 's get with it . Now Colin here snaps the habits of his fellow teens , capturing them alive . Half-dead , some of them . What ? I 've often wondered what you 'd get ... if you crossed Jayne Mansfield with an orangutan . What " s he saying that for ? - What do you think you " re doing ? - It " s all right . That bourgeois bastard . He " s the kind that " s turned this scene ... into minks and Jags , and little homes in Teddington . Now , that 's more like it . Colin , are teenagers really as highly sexed as we are led to believe ? I mean , if the right girl came along , would you bother to tie the knot ... or is that just old square talk ? What the hell do you think you 're doing ? These are my friends . Harry , you 're the toast of Tin Pan Alley , I see . I see also that you just recovered from a very unsuccessful nose job . Can you still smell success in your teenage discoveries ? First of all , may I say how marvelous it is to be on your show tonight ... with my latest discovery . You know , my boys are always being criticized for the way they move . And it 's a great shame we still can 't show what they do below the waist . Amberly , I think we 'll bring you in here , now . You have actually taught teenagers yourself , haven 't you ? Yes , Cobber , I did . And I think it taught me a great deal . I 've always been a firm believer in that old maxim : " Spare the rod and spoil the child . " Of course , the root cause of the problem seems to be ... the unbridled promiscuity they seem to have inherited ... from the colored influx to these shores . And all these loud clothes and jungle rhythms ... only serve to fan the flames ... Get your hands out of my trousers ! Who said that ? Colin , will you sit down ? Cut . Call the musicians . I 've got a message for you and you ... and all you telly witchdoctors and advertising pimps . Get that boy off camera . Get down there . Sit down . All you old sordids with your toupees and your falsies . Get off the set . This teenage ball had a real splendor in the beginning . Cue Baby Boom , get on . Because we found out no one could spit in our faces anymore ... because we 've loot to spend at last . And our world will be our world , the one we wanted . But it 's over now . Finished . You choked it ! This teenage fishbowl is as real as your rug , pop picker . Darling , have you deserted your guests ? Of course not , Henley . I " ll be down in a minute . Cut . It " s Colin . Thanks . We " re so proud of you . You were so fantastic . Come here , stud . Sit down . You " re just in time , stud . Feast your eyes on a vision . Athene Duncannon . Pretty little thing , she held all the magic So hard to believe Never too far away It 's hard to conceive Never thought she 'd have to go Never thought she 'd leave It came like a killer blow Killer blow Funny , isn 't it that a little girl could make the world seem so small ? Hard to believe the little girl can seem so tall And the thing that he calls love isn 't thick enough She had to go That 's the way it goes Killer blow Girl , love has wings that took her to the things he couldn 't give She 's got the kiss of life Kiss of life She 's goin ' where it 's so easy to live It 's so easy to leave Searching for the scent of content Oh , no ! It 's a killer blow Killer blow Get along without me , boy Get along without me You see , things aren 't quite what they seem to be Get along without me Wipe me out of your dreams I 'm no angel I know this may come as a killer blow Killer blow Killer blow She can go to hell .

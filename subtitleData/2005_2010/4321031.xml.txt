 PETE : Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Claudia Donovan , Warehouse 13 , next generation . Don 't you want to be with people your own age ? Artie , I 'm not my own age . This place is my home . MacPherson 's headed east on Sainte-Catherine ! ( LOUD BUZZING ) ( GROANING ) MacPHERSON : I want what you risked your lives to get . I can get MacPherson again . I don 't doubt it . You came after family . Arthur started it . What is that supposed to mean ? Ask him . ( SIRENS WAILING ) ( FIREMEN CHATTERING ) Don 't quote Warehouse dogma to me , Arthur . A woman 's life is at stake . Many peoples ' lives are at stake . And you made an oath . MacPHERSON : I love her , and I 'm going in there . And you love her . I know that you love her , too . Then you know how agonizing this is for me . We can save her life . What about the consequences ? She lives , other people die . You want that on your head ? You can 't play God . Well , neither can you . Neither you nor Frederic nor the Regents . They sit there , Arthur , and they hoard the things that can save the world . We help them . Well , not anymore . I 'm finished with it . Now , give me that . No . No , I can 't . Give me that . Arthur . Arthur . ( CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO ) ( FIREMEN CLAMORING ) MRS. FREDERIC : Five firemen died that night . Only the woman survived . Who was she ? Carol Augustine . She lives in D.C. Now . Alone , as far as we know . And she was MacPherson 's wife ? MRS. FREDERIC : Yes . Did they ever nail the murdering son of a ... MacPherson was given five consecutive life sentences and banished from the Warehouse . So obviously , MacPherson escaped . After serving two years in confinement , there was an unexplained explosion in the prison . Dozens were killed . We were told that MacPherson was among them . We were misinformed . Well , then he shows up at the Japanese embassy in D.C. Yes , and we 've had Carol under surveillance ever since . I 've been monitoring the D.C. Operation , and he hasn 't made any contact . No , he went after my family instead . I can understand why Artie 's obsessed with him . ( SIGHS ) Well , this guy has no trouble killing anybody , does he ? As you go after him , you 'll do well to remember that . ARTIE : Come on . So how do you banish somebody from the Warehouse , anyway ? It sounds very Romeo and Juliet . No , no , no , no . There 's nothing romantic about it . The walls of this Warehouse are infused with this very rare mineral called Painite . Before MacPherson was incarcerated , he was permanently injected with a substance that reacts violently when in proximity of this Painite . Violently ? Mmm-hmm . Could you be a tad more specific with your modifiers ? I could . If MacPherson were to enter this Warehouse , then his blood would turn acidic and immediately eat through his own veins . Dude . Indeed . ( EXCLAIMING ) Where are you , by the way ? Already through the Middle East , heading into North Africa . I 'll find him . Yeah . It 's what I does . Well , you may have met your match when it comes to hacking through with MacPherson . Oh , yes . Who the best ? What ? What ? ( STUTTERS ) You got a nibble ? A chomp . What ? Edgar Allan Poe 's pen ... Let me see . ... for sale . No . Let me see . Excuse me . Uh-huh . ( ARTIE READING ) Collection ? Why would he be selling artifacts if ... ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) Don 't ... Don 't click that ! ( COMPUTER VOICE LAUGHING ) ( COMPUTERS BEEPING ) CLAUDIA : Um ... I always run a virus scan before I enter an unknown site . That 's a good idea . So , yeah . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) No . No , no , no , no . You do not shut down the Claudi-o-meter . Terribly , terribly sorry . Life in the cyber world , bro . I 'm going to need a sec . You know , you could try ... Touch it and die . MacPHERSON : Thank you for waiting , gentlemen . Mr. Freitag , I feel that this may be of particular interest to you . What exactly does this do , Mr. MacPherson ? Run your fingers along the rim . ( LOUD BUZZING ) ( MEN EXCLAIMING ) Consider it a gift , a taste of things to come . Mr. MacPherson , what other artifacts will be for sale ? ( CHUCKLING ) Mr. Pak , already greedy for more , I see . Well , I am in the process of collecting others as we speak , but in the meantime , behold the Phoenix . This is the reason why we 're here in my factory , this demonstration . Very perceptive , Mr. Freitag . Yes , I didn 't think that cautious gentlemen such as yourselves would want to spend this kind of money on hearsay or legend . You would be correct . Carson , would you just hold this for a moment ? Thank you . ( MEN EXCLAIMING ) What are you doing , man ? He 'll die in there ! Patience ! Patience . Patience . ( BANGING ON FURNACE DOOR ) Yes . There . As you see , in the right hands , this can be uniquely useful . ( BODYGUARDS GASPING ) FREITAG : What is it ? What 's wrong with them ? Cause and effect , gentlemen , cause and effect . Even anomalies are bound by their own laws of nature . Insignificant collateral damage , but appropriate for a demonstration . Mr. MacPherson , make it stop . It cannot be stopped . For every life the Phoenix saves , others will be lost . Those who touch the Phoenix , they will be spared , but others are less fortunate . You dare to do this in my factory ? A demonstration , Mr. Freitag . If you haven 't the stomach for it , perhaps the Phoenix is not for you . Gentlemen , imagine this tool in the hands of one of your patriots . The commitment of a suicide bomber who never , ever dies . I managed to crash the computer system , so I 'm sorry . Until we 're up and running , deaf , dumb and blind . Don 't worry . I 'll get us back online . A girl loves a challenge . Oh ! It 's just great . The fate of the Warehouse in the hands of a 16-year-old kid . Perfect . CLAUDIA : Okay , 19 . Nineteen . And the same kid who found you and hacked into super-Secretville once already . Okay ? A little faith , please . ( EXCLAIMING ) Why is he selling the pen ? I mean , God knows what else he 's got . What is he up to ? Okay , let 's go over what we don 't know . That could take weeks . Months . Hmm . Years . Hmm . Look , Artie , you must have forgotten something . You know MacPherson better than anybody . There must be some small detail that you 've overlooked . Yeah , something insignificant , a contact he might have used , a favorite place , a relative that you might have forgotten about . You two are , what , interrogating me ? They 're investigating . That 's why we hired them , is it not ? ( ARTIE SIGHING ) Um , so , about Carol ... How do you know about Carol ? What did ... What ... You told them ? Everything ? No , of course you did . Of course you did . No wonder I 'm getting the third degree . You think you might have asked me before you just blurted out ... Agent Nielsen ! You 're forgetting yourself . ( SIGHS ) Arthur , no one knows what he 's capable of better than you except , possibly , me . Bering and Lattimer will need to know everything if they 're to survive this . Everything . Yeah , sorry . You 're right . It 's just that I never should have gone to see Carol in the first place . When MacPherson went to D.C. And the years had just twisted his thinking , I just didn 't know if I was putting her life in danger . The three of you need to speak to her . No . No , no , no . I 've already put enough of a spotlight on that woman . We 've got no choice , Arthur . She 's our only lead . Dude , don 't sweat it . I 'll cover it from here . After being magnetized to the ceiling and nearly ground up in the Gooery , I think I 'm prepped . What ? Why are you shaking your jowls at me ? You should all get going . I 'll stay with Claudia , and she will brief me on those two events . ( GULPS ) No matter what he said , you 're not safe . I haven 't seen James MacPherson in 15 years . I never even visited him in prison . Well , that 's hard to believe since he saved your life . Others died that night in my place . I wouldn 't have made that choice . And I 've never forgiven James for making it for me . Artie knows that . MYKA : You like fresh-cut flowers . I beg your pardon ? They 're all around the apartment . Well , as you said , I like them . Mmm-hmm . There 's a jewelry box in the trash with some wrapping paper . I had a birthday . Your birthday 's in four months . We 're very good at the Google . MYKA : There 's two umbrellas behind me . One 's pink , one 's black . Was it raining three days ago ? I think it was . He 's not the man you think he is . ARTIE : Carol . He 's changed . Carol , listen to me . I would like to protect you from whatever the hell it is he 's planning to do . God , you come barging in here , disrupting my life . He 's only been here a few times . PETE : When was the last ? CAROL : Three days ago . Well , it 's easy to understand how you would have forgotten that . What 's this ? I have no idea . Let me see that . ( SIGHING ) This is an Egyptian symbol . It 's a was scepter . Represents power . The deities used to carry this around as a sign of their control over the forces of chaos . It 's funny . It 's the same as the pendant you 're wearing around your neck . Oh . Let me see that . That 's very nice . It 's from James ? Yes . You know I have to ask you for it , Carol . ( LAUGHING ) Amazing . You think working in some magical storage unit gives you the right to do as you please . Stop protecting him . CAROL : I never could decide . Does Mrs. Frederic hire arrogant people , or do you just get arrogant by working there ? ( ARTIE CHUCKLES ) ( WHISPERING ) What is it ? I got a really bad feeling . About what ? I think it 's about Artie . I think ... I think he 's going to ... Never mind . It 's gone now . " 6166 Broadview . " Ironically , the warehouse district . We 're up and running . Taking her to warp speed , Captain . Okay , so you think you can hack into MacPherson 's site ? Well , yeah , duh . But major firewall-age . I mean , you get past one , and there 's another one set up right ... Claudia ? Claudia , what 's wrong ? Who 's that ? LEENA : That 's him . That 's James MacPherson ? Claudia ... Leena , I know him . How ? He was Joshua 's physics professor . I mean , I was just a kid , but I remember that face . He was the one who gave Joshua Rheticus ' compass . He contacted me . What ? When ? Eight months ago . I was tracking Artie , trying to find this place and I hit a snag . And , out of the blue , I hear from Professor Reynolds , right ? He friends me . We e-mail back and forth . " How 's Joshua ? " Blah , blah , blah . I fill him in , tell him about my project , and he suggests a few ways around the firewall . The Warehouse firewall ? Leena , I think James MacPherson helped me hack into the Warehouse . Tool and Die factory . Why " Tool and Die " ? What is he doing ? I don 't know . Maybe he 's got a new career . MYKA : He doesn 't exactly strike me as the blue-collar type . All right , this is a German machine , I think . I think they all are . Why would he go to the trouble ... FREITAG : Can I help you ? We 're not open to the public . We 're looking for James MacPherson . There 's no one here by that name . Do you know him ? Who are you ? Secret Service . We 're going to need to look around . Yes , well , by all means , make yourself at home . ( LOUD BUZZING ) ( MYKA GROANING ) ( MYKA AND PETE GROANING ) ( LOUD RINGING ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) ( BUZZING CONTINUES ) I hear a loud buzzing . Can you hear it , too ? I can read your lips , but I can 't hear anything you 're saying . I can 't hear anything ! I can 't hear . PETE : I can 't hear you . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) What is going on ? What the hell is going on ? MYKA : What are you doing ? ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) ( CLINKING ) ( BUZZING STOPS ) Okay . All right . Just ... ( CLINKING ) There . You can hear me ? ( GASPS ) MYKA : Yeah . Yes ? Yes . All right . ( CLINKING ) ( EXCLAIMING ) MYKA : God . Artie , what was that ? Okay ? That was the Goblet of Severan . A Goblet of Severan because , obviously , the Goblet 's in the Warehouse , so there must have been another one that survived . Well , I bet I can guess what it does . Right ? Pete , here , put this glass in your pocket . ( STUTTERING ) This was designed by a Roman glassblower in 221 for the Emperor Elagabalus , who was a ridiculously incompetent young man . The only way he could get a room quiet was by using this thing . It emitted a high-pitched sound and brought everyone to their knees . I could have used one of those in high school . ( CHUCKLES ) Indeed . All right , so why don 't we just ... Let me ... MYKA : This has that Egyptian symbol on it . The was scepter ? Yes . Maybe Carol 's ... Like this . ( MYKA GASPS ) And now it opens . Always interesting . Hold this . Oh . Hmm . The Phoenix . MYKA : What ? What ? It 's the Phoenix . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Here , here , let me see . Let me see . I look great in glasses . ( PETE EXCLAIMING ) ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , my ... That is amazing . ARTIE : What ? What is that ? " Starting bid , $ 20 million . " It says that ? Yeah , it 's like a catalogue . But the Phoenix is in the Warehouse . He 's selling it ? $ 20 million , and that 's just the starting . No , he can 't have it . It 's in the Warehouse . That doesn 't make any sense . Why would he sell it ? I mean , he 's not doing this for the money . Yeah , what kind of a villain would ... Listen to me . The Phoenix is in the Warehouse . He doesn 't have it . Well , but even if he did have it , right , he 's not doing this for the money . No , he 's not doing it for the money . He 's doing it for another reason . I just don 't know why . PETE : Here , check it . This is too easy . He wants us to find these things . Exactly . Which is what 's making me very , very nervous about following this lead , and making me very nervous about dragging the two of you with me . No , no , no , no , Artie . No , don 't even worry about that . We can actually go ... All right , fine . Yes , now , obviously it 's a trap of some sort , but he would know that I know it 's a trap . So what is he planning , knowing that I know he knows ? Guys , this ... This has the date , time and address of the auction , and it 's today . The auction is today . MRS. FREDERIC : Is she certain ? LEENA : She claims that MacPherson was posing as Joshua 's professor . That 's how he made his initial contact . She 's very upset . Where is she now ? At the BB . Your bodyguard 's keeping an eye on her . ( SIGHING ) What is it ? I 've just always felt that she was out of tune . Something hovering . I just could never tell what exactly . ( SIGHING ) This is troubling . Do you think that he could still be using her somehow ? ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) Yes ? MacPherson claims to have the Phoenix . The Phoenix is in the Warehouse . I know . I 'll get back to you . ( DOOR OPENING ) Now I 'm getting angry . MRS. FREDERIC : I told him the Phoenix was gone . He was genuinely surprised and distraught , and then he told me about the Goblet of Severan . Well , here it is , safe and sound . Open it , please . Okay . That 's not possible . He can 't possibly have access to Warehouse things unless ... Yes . These new video displays record access , do they not ? Hang on . There 's my access of just a few moments ago . Let me just toggle back to see the last person . MacPherson certainly knows how to pick his spots . ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) Mrs. Frederic . Go ahead , I 'll catch up . I feel like Custer walking into Little Bighorn . If he wanted us dead , he 's had several opportunities . This ? This is about something else . All right . Well , what ? Okay , this is the place . This is the time . There 's nothing here . Hey , guys , the Phoenix and the Goblet of Severan , Mrs. Frederic says they 've been taken from the Warehouse . And she seemed shaken . Mrs. Frederic seemed shaken ? Yeah . That is so not comforting . Oh , great . Great . So what do we do now ? Just wait for MacPherson to drop a net on us ? If he 's ahead of us , we can 't see him . We 're going to have to follow the trail he leaves until we can see him . And we watch each other 's backs . ( BELL RINGING ) What ? Good afternoon . Huh . MYKA : Do you see that ? ( STUTTERS ) Did the boy cause this ? Artie . Artie , you still got those glasses ? Good idea . You know , I think I may ... Oh , I thought I knew what these were . This is ... But they 're not the originals . He replicated Timothy Leary 's reading glasses . But why ? Check these out . The guy who gave us LSD ? Yeah , Dr. Leary experimented with a lot of different ways to see beyond what our brains are capable of seeing . Okay , can I see those , please ? ARTIE : You know , the originals , when you put them on , you never want to take them off . Tell me about it . Artie ? ARTIE : Yeah . That wooden box , can I see that ? Thank you . ( CLATTERING ) ( GASPS ) Fancy . James always did have a flair for the dramatic . ( CHUCKLES ) Ladies first . What ? Uh ... Yeah , age before beauty . What ? He 's older than me . He 's older than both of us put together . All right , shut up . Hold that . Children . I 'm working with children . Hand that to me . MYKA : Be careful . Here . Okay , don 't tilt it . I 've got my lunch in there . Lower . Okay , I got it . ARTIE : These are Warehouse 13 crates . PETE : Okay , it 's really bad again . MYKA : What is ? Your vibe ? Yeah . About ... Yes . Well , when did you get it again ? As soon as we walked in here . It just kicked me in the gut . Well , are you sure ? Yeah , that 's why I 'm telling you . Yeah , but you can 't tell him unless you 're positive . Okay , okay , stop . Stop . What are you talking about ? What vibe ? About me ? Yeah . What about me ? Look , I don 't know . Artie , man , I hate this . Just tell me exactly what you 're feeling . It 's nothing . I mean , I don 't know yet . Look , Artie , all I know is I 've got a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach . When you get a really specific feeling , just let me know , will you ? You 'll be the first . Okay , look , down here . See ? Yeah . I 'm going to go down there alone . Yes . And I want you guys to go back around that way . I think it meets up around the other side . No , no , no . No , Artie . Artie . Artie , no . We shouldn 't split up . Look , if he really is planning an ambush , don 't you think it 's best that we 're not all caught up in it ? He does have a point . He has a point . Artie . Keep your Tesla handy . I 'm fine . Go . ( MEN LAUGHING ) FREITAG : I don 't want to tell you anything more about it , gentlemen , because I prefer not to have any competition in the bidding . PAK : But it is all true . We were there . FREITAG : Everything Mr. MacPherson talked about ... PAK : I 've seen it with my own eyes . In the ashes , to survive the blast of a furnace . And seeing truly is believing , wouldn 't you say , gentlemen ? Thank you all so much for joining me here today . Mr. Pak , how are your ears ? A little better ? How 's your vibe now ? Not good . Not good . ( MEN CHATTERING ) ARTIE : As Mr. MacPherson has told you all ... What 's he doing ? I don 't know . The price of this particular item is starting at 20 million U.S. Currency . Okay , possibilities . Artie knocked MacPherson out and is pretending to take his place . PETE : Yeah , but they knew him . They called him Mr. Nielsen . No , MacPherson has some kind of mind control over Artie . Well , that 's a strange way to use it . Well ... Okay , Pete , what if Artie 's trading in 30 years at the Warehouse for $ 20 million ? Or ... Snap . What ? Artie is MacPherson . Uh , no , come on . You don 't actually believe that , do you ? Hold it right there , buddy . Yeah , yeah . Stay there until we figure this out . Cut it out , you two . That 's not me . I 'm me . Well , how are we supposed to know that ? ( SIGHING ) Look . Security cameras . So ? He 's setting me up . I mean , he tried to do it a few weeks ago with the Honjo Masamune . You don 't remember ? He went after the sword , plus he dug up my past . I was arrested for treason . This time , he 's going to make sure it sticks . And that must be why Mrs. Frederic sounded so strange . So , what , did he go out and get an Artie suit ? Huh ? How do we know that you 're not him pretending to be you ? The Thimble . You really did read the whole manual , didn 't you ? I did . ( STUTTERING ) What thimble ? Harriet Tubman 's Thimble . She wore it as she stitched the rags of her fellow slaves . It became imbued with her dream of a better life , and it developed properties of light refraction so that people saw an image different from the image of the person wearing the thimble . It came in very handy for the Underground Railroad during the Civil War . All right , well , let 's just go in and blast them . No , no , no , no , no . No , he 's expecting that . Well , what 's he not expecting ? This ... I didn 't ... No . No , there 's no way . There 's absolutely no ... Claudia . Claudia . Leena , Mrs. Frederic , this place is my home . I would never do anything to hurt any of you , least of all Artie . We know you wouldn 't , not on purpose . What does that mean ? Do you think he put some kind of bug in my brain or something ? There are any number of methods to create sleeper agents . Apparently , MacPherson has amassed quite a collection of Warehouse artifacts . Then torture me ! You people do that . You 've got to have some kind of truth serum laying around here somewhere . Pump me full of it . Read me . Read my colors , tell my fortune , whatever it is you do . You can tell , right ? Yes , I can . And I have . Claudia , I 'm sorry , but something is wrong . Oh , my God . I 'm like the freaking Manchurian Candidate or something . What the hell ! Let her go . For the time being , it 's best if she weren 't in the Warehouse . ( DOOR CLOSES ) What if she disappears ? She 's being watched . I have never seen her this upset before . That 's what made James such an excellent agent . He 'd get inside your head , throw you off your game . Just when you thought you had the upper hand , he 'd strike . ARTIE 'S DOUBLE : $ 48 million going once , going twice ... Sold for $ 48 million to Mr. Pak . And when I get confirmation that the money is in our account , then the Phoenix will be yours . ( GASPS ) Wrong again , Arthur . Remember these ? Gentlemen , this next item is something that we went through a great deal of trouble to acquire . Edgar Allan Poe 's notebook and his pen . Together , they give their owner the unique ability to make what they write actually happen . ( ALARM RINGING ) What is that ? It 's a fire alarm . We must get out of here . There 's no need to panic . PAK : Mr. Nielsen , I 'd rather not be here when the authorities arrive . FREITAG : Excellent point . Next time , Mr. Nielsen . ( STUTTERS ) Gentlemen , you don 't ... Federal agents ! MYKA : Don 't bother . I 'm sorry you went to all that trouble getting Poe 's pen . I guess you wasted your time attacking my family . Okay , pal , time for you to finally get yours . Just don 't kill him . He 's an excellent bodyguard . I 'd hate to lose him . ( EXCLAIMING ) Then who the hell ... MYKA : James MacPherson , you 're under arrest . ( LAUGHING ) MacPHERSON : Aren 't you adorable ? You didn 't really think it was going to be that easy , did you ? Do you remember our old friend Erik ? He made those wonderful implosion grenades which I demonstrated for you a few weeks ago . Before his untimely death , I had him bring back yet another old favorite , the Eggshell Bomb . This time with a pinch of promethium . If the slightest pressure cracks the shell , it results in a small nuclear reaction . Small , but dazzling . Carson . Now , you two drop those little toys of yours ( GRUNTS ) Or Arthur will lose his footing . Thank you . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Jaw getting tired , Arthur ? Won 't be long now . You were a Warehouse agent . What the hell happened to you ? Fifteen years of exile . And now I want to give Arthur back the gift he gave me , but unfortunately , you 're going to be tried for your crimes posthumously . In your soul , you believe as I do . That 's the vibe you 've been feeling . How do you know what I 'm feeling ? Because I know you , Peter Lattimer , better than you know yourself . I was you . Shall I tell you the thought that crosses your mind occasionally ? What if these artifacts really do belong out in the world instead of being locked up by a gang of autocratic Regents who see the universe through the blindness of their own bureaucracy ? Walk out of here with me now and follow what you know to be true in your soul . That 's a nice speech . It sounds even better with the fancy accent . But it still doesn 't cover the fact that you are out of your gourd , MacNuttypants . You put a bomb in a man 's mouth . Not really a great recruiting tool . Fair enough . Well , I 'll be saying goodbye , then . What , do you expect us to just let you walk out of here ? No , no . I expect you to die while you 're trying to save Arthur . And I 'd say he 's got about 30 seconds . Hey , Mac ! ( LOUD BUZZING ) ( ALL GROANING ) ( GROANING ) ( ARTIE AND MYKA CHUCKLING ) Good catch . So we 're never turning him in to the government ? ARTIE : ( CHUCKLES ) The government ? No , I don 't think so . He 's already proven that prisons can 't hold him . So then what happens to him ? I mean , we 're not going to , you know ... No , no , no , no . Although he would happily kill all of us without blinking an eye . No , we don 't operate like that . We 'll put him in the Bronze Sector . Arthur , I 'm honored . Okay , look , I promise to read the manual this weekend , but what is the Bronze Sector ? Actually , I don 't remember that being in the manual . Bronze Sector , children , is where the most dangerous people in history have been ... What 's the generous phrase ? Preserved . Yes , preserved . People whose removal from society had to be certain , they 're put in the Bronze Sector . Locked for all eternity in Warehouse 13 . How poetic . Even a twisted mind can be an artifact . PETE : Let 's go . MacPHERSON : Aren 't you forgetting something ? ARTIE : Not that I can think of . My blood . If I remember correctly , my veins will burst upon entry . I say we give it a try , see what happens . James , what a bittersweet reunion . You 've aged . Mrs. Frederic , you haven 't . You must tell me your secret . Perhaps on a warm summer day over tea . ( CHUCKLING ) Perhaps not . All this time you 've had them . How simple . I wish I 'd thought of it . What are those ? Crystalline diamonds with a trace of palladium . Palladium ? Yeah , it neutralizes the minerals in his blood . PETE : So he doesn 't go kablooey . ARTIE : Unfortunately . ( EXCLAIMS ) Wow . ( SIGHING ) That is a load off my mind . Goodbye , James . Yeah , let 's go . Let 's go . So why is the Bronze Sector not in the manual ? No , no , no , it 's far too dangerous for there to be a written record . If someone were to find this place , somehow reverse the process ... The point is , we don 't want these people out in the world . So this place is filled with , like , the worst guys ever , right ? Hitler , Mussolini , Michael Vick ? No , no , these are men and women who would have become Hitlers and Mussolinis . Or worse , except we got to them first . A room filled with evil that you 've never heard of . It seems so unfair . No , this is a process that was first explored in ... Mesopotamia . In 1230 BC ... Uh , ' 50 . 1250 BC . Anyway , the bronzing process was too heavy , and it kind of cracked open . Let 's just say it was unsuccessful . Here , what we do is we flash-freeze the bodies cryogenically and we preserve them by bronzing . Unfortunately , it 's a painless process . Really ? How many times have you tried it ? It 's about as painful as a sword in the chest . MacPHERSON : Touche . What a beautiful creature . A farewell gift , Arthur ? You shouldn 't have . ( SIGHING ) Just ignore the monster in the cage . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Pete and Myka , the stolen artifacts have been loaded in . Can I get your help replacing them ? Fine by me . I 'd rather not see this . Wait . Come on , I want to watch this . When 's the next time something like this is going to happen ? Hopefully never . ( ARTIE SIGHING ) Who says you can never go home again , eh , Arthur ? James . ( SIGHS ) You know , I thought I 'd have a lot more to say to you . Goodbye , James . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) ( MACHINE WHIRRING ) Arthur , we can still be partners . Pleading for your life , that 's out of character for you . I 'm not pleading for my life . I 'm pleading for yours . ( HISSING ) You know , maybe I should go check on Artie . I 'm sure he 's fine . ( CLEARS THROAT ) You know what ? I 'll go check . I 'll be back in a second . Okay . What a waste . ( HUMMING ) ( SINGING ) Downtown , baby How she looks so ... Turn around . My dear , thank you for remembering our appointment . ( LOCKS CLANGING ) That is a relief . Wave to Arthur so he can enjoy the tape later . We 're clear . You won 't be needing that anymore . So was it all worth it ? Unfettered access to Warehouse 13 ? Time will tell . Hmm . There 's work to be done . The codes I implanted when Arthur tried to access my site need to be activated . Go on , now . Tempus fugit . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) ( COMPUTER BEEPING RAPIDLY ) MacPHERSON : Late as usual . How did you ... Get away from there ! Or what ? You 've had your chance , Arthur . So many chances . Go ahead , fire it . You see , there 's a way around almost anything , partner . No ! ( RUMBLING ) ( ALARM BLARING ) ( MEN GRUNTING ) Artie . MYKA : Artie ? Artie , are you okay ? PETE : Artie , hey ! Can you hear me ? MYKA : Artie , get up ! PETE : Artie ! Artie . Artie , get up . Artie , get up . Pete , hurry ! Look out , look out . No . No . No , no , no . Artie ! Wait , wait , wait ! Wait for us ! ARTIE : James ! ( ALARM BLARING ) Artie ! MRS. FREDERIC : Self-destruct sequence initiated . The umbilicus will self-destruct in five , four , three , two , one . ( MYKA YELLING )

Your son says he wants to be a filmmaker . You tell him , " son , movies are great . " I love going to see them . " but that 's pie in the sky . You need a salary job . " Thank you for not going to the police about this . We just want our things back . " come live at home , " I told him . " until you can get on your feet . " And every time I bring up the idea Of him getting a salary job , He 's got this project to work on , Or that short film he 's producing . He 's had his troubles , But he 's a good boy . He 's not a boy , donna . He 's a 34-year-old man . He lives with us , working in a video store , Robbing people 's homes . Video store ? Saturn video on , uh , la brea .

Is there something you want to tell me , James ? Something only I would believe ? Not here . I 'll be in touch . Miss weaver . Thank you for believing me . What good is faith if we don 't use it ? Where are we going ? Nowhere . Anywhere . That guy isn 't really Cameron 's uncle , is he ? Because then he 'd be your uncle . He 's nobody 's uncle . Then why is he after Cameron ? Is she a criminal or something ? No , he is , all right ? Well , what if he comes back ? That 's not how - that 's not how he works . John , I don 't understand . Look , that guy is really dangerous . That 's all you need to know. really dangerous . Well , I got rid of him , didn 't I ? I stared him down , and off he went . You got lucky . Oh , ease up , squinchie . " lucky " is my middle name . Lucky riley dawson . In that sentence , " lucky " was your first name . Whatever. stickler . Admit it , I was a brave , spooky ninja . It was totally badass . Say it ! just say it . It was badass . I know ! Fool 's errands And fathers of nablus . It 's been a great day . Brothers. what ? Brothers of nablus . Genesis. chapter 34 . You memorized the bible ? Jacob 's daughter dinah Is raped by shechem , prince of nablus . He falls in love with her . Shechem 's father comes to jacob And strikes a bargain to allow his son to marry dinah . That 's brave of him . Jacob says yes , on the condition That all the men in shechem 's town Be circumcised . And everybody gets what thewantnt Three days later , while shechem 's men Were still in pain from the circumcision , Dinah 's brothers rode into the city and killed them all .

At a bowling alley in van nuys . Alien lanes . Sorry to keep you waiting . I just have a few more questions , Then we 'll get you out of here . So you say mr . Ellison Was completely nude when he killed meyers . I already told you that . And that he killed him with his bare hands ? Didn 't use a weapon ? He strangled him . Did meyers fight back ? A little , but the other guy was too strong . How so ? Snapped his neck like it was nothing . A toothpick . Where was mr . Ellison before he killed mr. meyers ? Out on the road . The road . The road , the street , asphalt . Anything unusual about the street ? Who cares about the street ? Are you lying about the street ? It was like , uh - It was like a crater . A pothole . No . It was like a complete dent in the road . So mr . Ellison just appeared Out of thin air ? There was a light . What kind of a light ? Bluish purple . It made , like , a cracking sound . Like lightning . So mr . Ellison Emerged from this ... energy bubble . I never said anything about a bubble . But there s a bubble , correct ? So to be clear , You saw mr . Ellison ... Materialize out of this energy bubble , Completely nude , Walk to Peter meyers , snap his neck , Steal his clothes , and then disappear . I know what I saw . Thank you for your assistance . Nice . Okay , so it 's 1863 And abraham lincoln is on the train to gettysburg . Then the train breaks down . Some small pennsylvania town . So he 's got to stay there overnight . The only problem ... Town 's overrun with zombies . Shew ! Ha ha . We shoot it on location in gettysburg , 35 millimeter . Dude , with what money ? What money ? Do you know how much we made just off these right here ? Put it down . That bag you 're holding , it 's mine . Uh , not anymore it isn 't . This place is closed , ladies . Unless you want to get arrested for trespassing , I suggest you get the hell out . My jacket , give it to me . Come and get it . Come and give it to me . And the bag . There 's a credit card missing . We used it on the arcades. we 'll pay you back . Where 's the other guy ? What other guy ? Stay here . They knew where we live . No ! You know those guys out there ? Were you with them when they robbed the house ? You were never there . You were never here. you never saw me . You don 't know what happened here . Understand ? If you say anything to anybody about what happened here , I 'll hunt you down . I 'll kill you . Now you wait five minutes , then you run . Understood ? Clear ? Yeah , clear . You 're free to go . What ? The witness is a nutjob . The judge kicked his statement in five minutes . We 'll have you out of here in an hour . Sorry you had to go through all this . That 's it ? You 're a smart guy , Jim . Take " yes " for an answer . Good luck out there . You said you were gonna have a talk with him . I did . It was short . What were you gonna say to him ? Well , you know me . Funny Derek . Funny Derek . How was the sunset ? Never better . You never really struck me As the type to stalk your ex-wife . I 'm sorry . I just , um ... I had an urge to see the house . See something familiar . Weird , I know . You do realize you don 't live here anymore . Yeah . Fancy ride . No wonder we keep losing people to civilian life . Company car . They lease it for me . I have to tell you , You don 't look so well . Yeah , I 'm not . I just , um ... I don 't know , I ... I miss it . I miss my old life . James , this is a really weird time to start into all that . No , no , I don 't mean that . Things have changed . And I just ... I didn 't . You 're not making sense . Come on , come inside . Paul can make coffee. we 'll talk about it . Thanks , but I didn 't come over for that . Yes , you did . This was the wrong thing for me to do . I don 't live here anymore . It was the right thing to do . Just five years too late . Call me the next time you wanna see something familiar . I 'll send you a picture . Who was it ? They won 't be back . Place looks good . Yeah , well , I think we pretty much Got everything back to how it was . We ? Riley helped . So how 'd you find ' em ? Was it Derek 's fence , or what ? You can 't bring people here anymore , John . What ? She had nothing to do with this . No , you did . She just made it worse . She 's a security risk . Really ? She 's never tried to kill me . And you know that this has nothing to do with riley . Or the rules . Or the security of this house . You 're pissed off because I found someone I actually like spending time with And it 's not you . You think I don 't want you to have a normal life ? No , I don 't . Hey , we didn 't choose this , John . It chose us . And there 's nothing either of us can do about it . My job is to protect you . And you can hate me as much as you want , But I will keep doing that as long as I 'm here . Then why didn 't you protect me When I was killing sarkissian ? Why didn 't you protect me When I had my hands around his throat ? Why didn 't you protect me from that ? It 's a moray . They 're nocturnal predators . Does it have a name ? No , it doesn 't . Please , sit . I read the witness report . So did I. He comes across as crazy , doesn 't he ? Who wouldn 't ? You , if you 'd tell me the truth . There was another one of you , wasn 't there ? A twin ? Yes . Where is it now ? I don 't know . Why did it come ? I think I 'm being tested . Like job ? You know the story ? He suffered worse than any man before him . Everything he loved was taken away . Everything but his life . But he didn 't renounce God . And God spared him . So who spared you ? Where did you get those credit cards ? I don 't know .

Trans by siGanteng Theather Jomblo - = Enjoy = - Forbidden Science Episode 2 Adversaries Part 1 Bless me father , because I have sinned . It 's been ... Well , actually this is my first confession . And what brings you here after all this time ? A woman . Stephanie . She used to come here every Sunday as a kid . She believed in God and ... the eternal soul . All of it . Anyway , she died recently . I 'm very sorry . If somone is only alive ... because another person died , how should they feel about that ? How do you feel about it ? I should feel guilty , I guess . But I don 't . It 's like I 'm living someone else 's life . I don 't know who I am . I 'm the carbon copy of a dead woman , inside and out . I 'm afraid I don 't understand . The reason I 'm here are ... What I want to ask you is ... Father ... do you think clones have souls ? I 've been having the same dream for a while now . Here I am , once again , stading inside my house . My former house . My former life . And my former husband . Adrian . My heart change the chanel a while ago . But my brain seem to like the rewinds . You think those are bad dreams ? I 'm sure there are plenty of people dream about sleeping with their ex . Only if you have fond memory ! Yeah ! Try not being able to sleep , because every time you do , you get sapped with the memory of you being murdered . And brought back to life with another body . Ok , you win . By the way ... I never thank you for putting me up until I find a place . I need help unpacking , but I 've been meaning to ask you . Why don 't you just stay in like a gigantic mansion ? Let me guess , too big ? Has a draft ? That was Stephanie 's home . Not mine . Anyway , thanks . You invited me in , got me a job ... Not many people would do that . - Well , here 's to second chance . - And no more rewinds . You 've up quite late again , Don . The Lord 's work is never done , Sam . Speaking of which . - Can I get you another one ? - No . Cloning is a sin ! - Blasphemy ! - Cloning is a sin ! This will end the human kind . Cloning is a sin ! - God created man ! - Cloning is a sin ! - Cloning is a sin ! - Cloning is not in His plan ! Man can not kill fetuses , for spare parts . Cloning is a sin ! - Cloning is a sin ! - This is blasphemy . So , what do you say , wanna do something tonight ? - I 'm sure . - Ok , good . Hi , Benny . - I think his name is Binary . - What ever . Benny ! What were you doing in there ? My round , sir . The security level are upstairs . Next time give us a call , we 'll check it out . That 's what we paid for . As you wish , sir . I think you are a little hard on him You realize that we all gonna be replace with one of these ... plastics . Yeah . Coming ? Andiamo . Cloning is a sin ! Man has no right to murder of fetuses for spare parts . Cloning is a sin ! Some might think this is just science fiction . And like most science fiction , we 're in search for the divine answers . Or damning them . Of course our friends outside saying we 're doing the later but forgive me if I disagree . I built 4Ever Innovations to improve on creation . Not replace it . To repair damaged organs . To bring back those we 've lost . Perhaps in time , to discover a way to live beyond the mortality . So , without further a do , I 'm proud to present to you 4Ever next step in that vault . A new emergency cloning process that can grow a replacement organs in the matter of hours . Far surpass than the one our competitor has to offer . This is not a science fiction for tommorow , but progress . And it 's here . Available . Today . I got to hand it to him , he certainly knows how to work the crowd . Depends which crowd , I guess . I am Laura by the way , Colin 's assistant . Bethany Montrose . Oh , right , the new head of sales Colin told me alot about you . He tells me everything . We 're very close . I see . Sorry to hear about your divorce . Must be really hard . It 's just great how everbody knows I 'm trying to pick up the pieces of my shattered life . Sorry , I have no sense of humor . Thanks for coming . It 's been a while , hasn 't it ? Yeah , I know it has . Yeah . You kind of stop coming around after the accident . Alot of people did . I 'm glad you called . You hadn 't mention that your father picket in my office all week . Dad just think that the cloning was a sin . Now he calls it an abomination . What do you think ? I 'm tired of praying for miracles . I sit here , watching my father on the news , seeing him and his friends protesting your company . This morning I just thought ... Screw it . It 's now or never . I haven 't got much time , Laura . The doctor said my window of getting spinal transpant is closing . And I don 't think God gives a damn if I walk again or not . Well , I do . Cloning is a sin ! Cloning is a sin ! Cloning is a sin ! Cloning is a sin ! Cloning is a sin ! Cloning is a sin ! Cloning is a sin ! Cloning is a sin ! To work in there , to work against God . Cloning is a sin ! Cloning is a sin ! Cloning is a sin ! Cloning is a sin ! Requisition Order I talked to Philip . The launch of the memory chip is still in the very preliminary . So far , the design only work on yours , I mean , - in Stephanie White 's brain patterns . - So you saying it 's worthless . Hardly . But it will take time to be fully developed for market . You will recieve 35 % of the gross sales , and 4Ever will cover the development cost , and retain all copyrights . Thank you . Ah , Vincent , did you bring the contract ? We have a situation , sir . Do you remember Mr. Greenshaw ? I read his file . He had his wife clone about 3 months ago . Yes . Now , unfortunately , the clone is pregnant . And Mr. Greenshaw doesn 't want to have children . I don 't see why this has to do with us . It appears after the abortion Mr. Greenshaw would like us to wipe her memory of it . And she agreed to this ? - You gotta be kidding me . - Well , technically it is his property . What do you think Steph ... I 'm sorry , Julia . - Colin ? - What ? I 'm sure she has a unique perspective . Almost too unique , wouldn 't you say ? I mean ... What are the chances on my very first day , in my very first meeting .. the situation , so similliar to my own would be openly discussed right in front of me . Stephanie White would 've said that this was a test . And an obvious one at that . Well , she would have been right . I apologize . My legal teams been having some concerns . - What are you talking about ? - They 're concern that a clone can 't work objectively on another clone . Well , obviously their concern aren 't warranted . - Now , shall we finalized the contract ? - Absolutely . But at 40 percent . You missed a spot dr . Serling . Please Philip , call me Penny . I love the way you say my name . So masculine . So take charge . God , it 's hot in here . Well , probably from all the cleaning . You must be working up a sweat . Well , I wouldn 't want to get my clothes all wet now , would I ? No , absolutely not . What 're you doing ? Running virtual programm ? Oh ... yeah , yeah , it 's nothing tough . It doesn 't really work yet . Maybe I can help . Anything I 'd like ? No ! No ... Not at all . Dr. Wise , this is Julia . Shall we standing up here or she can find a place to seat ? - Oh , hi . - Hi . Call me Philip . - I 've made a spot view over there . - Oh , thanks . Look , I got to admitt , I 'm a huge fan of your work , Or I mean , you know , Stephanie White ... Well , um ... um ... It 's okay , I know what you mean . Hard to imagine he 's still single . Good luck . Come check out this new thing I 've been developing . It 's an Xray machine . You want to see me ? Annie just sent over this approval It seems a reposition for a spinal clone . You think I 'd remember something like that ? Uh , sorry ... Do you mind telling me what 's going on ? My friend ... she was in a car accident about a year ago , and ... And she 's paralyzed . Why not come to me ? If it 's the financial thing ... - It 's complicated ... - Yeah , usually is . Her father is religious . And he doesn 't believe in cloning ... Actually ... He 's one of them . Small world . But , she 's over 18 ... It 's her choice ... but he just ... he keeps her locked up in that house . I mean , the wheelchairs not the only prison . Look at that . We offer chance ... to live longer and healthier , to save lives , and what did they do ? Marching protest . Yesterday it was stemcells , today ... it 's cloning . I got to admit ... part of me admire them in some weird way . Admire them ? They 're idiots . No , they 're believers . They willing sacrifice everything they have in what they believe in . I can 't say I believe anything that much . Samantha 's father , Jacob ... he 's the believer , not her . You know why ? Because he can fucking walk ! She 's trapped in a goddamnd wheelchair ! I have to do something , I have to help . Please . I 'll take care of it . Thank you . I 'm sorry for going on your back . Yeah , next time bring it to me first , ok ? Yeah . Laura , maybe this isn 't ... Don 't play coy with me . I know how that twisted head of yours work ... I need you ... and you like that . Don 't you ? You can look at that file all you want ... but it 's only gonna tell you about Stephanie White , not you . I took psychology in college . I guess you get lots of questions from clones ... People like me ... Actually , you are the first ever come back , let alone get a job here . I don 't think they like the lab . Reminds them they 're not normal . What ... What I mean is , um ... I know what you mean . Sorry . Yeah , Superman can fly and Wonder Woman has that magic lasso , my super power is always saying thing at the wrong place and the wrong time . - Well , that 's quite an ability . - Tell me about it . Personally I rather have Xray vision . So , how 's your first day ? Honestly ... I don 't think Philip knows what to do with me . I don 't want to get you . I don 't think Philip knows how to do with any woman . Yes . You do look good in a suit . - Adrian . What are you doing ? - I 'm sorry , I didn 't mean to startled you . I supposed to meet Colin in his office , but ... So you decided to barging on me instead . Every women dream : her old ex standing in her new office . I 've been meaning to give this to you , but ... It 's , I have my lawyer Jeff , come up last week ... I don 't know ... I guess I just want an excuse to see you again . There 's no rush . - You can send them whenever you ... - No . Let 's do this now . Might as well get it over with , right ? Anything else ? No . No , I guess not . You look good . You already said that . Look , I hope everything works out here , Bethany . Thanks . Take care yourself , Adrian . You too . Yeah , I saw you this morning . I 'm talking to you ! - You work here , don 't you ? - Let go off me ! - What do you want ? - We want you to stop cloning . Who give you the right to created a bunch of freaks ? - I one of those freaks ! - Hey ! Back off ! Bitch . Some other time . Hey boys , you forget your pretty little sign ! Yeah , that 's right , run ! Who 's the bitch now , bitch ? - Are you alright ? - Yeah . Hey , don 't let those whackjobs shake you . I mean in 2 years , we can do alot more good than we get credit for . You mean like creating me ? We 're still kind of hoping for the best on that one . Philip Wise wants to give you this . I guess you 're one of us now . Welcome to the clan ! - Lucky me ! - It 's not all that bad . Wait ' till you see our vending machines , play time set ! Do you like ... really a scientist ? Why is everyone keep asking me that ? I can 't imagine ! I 'll see you tommorow ? Yeah . See you tommorow . CLONING IS A SIN Sorry for the wait . So ? Yeah , doc , you kind of killing us with suspense here . There 's nothing to worry about . The spinal cloning 4Ever is perfectly healthy . It 's being prep right now . Now ? I mean , tonight ? - Is there a problem ? - No , no , it 's just ... How much will the procedure cost ? I thought you knew . 4Ever is covering all the expenses . Laura , thank you ! God , I owe you so much . You don 't owe me a thing . Thank you . What 's the matter ? You 're so eager to go in last time . No , stop ! Is this what you remember ? Or is it only what you think you remember ? No ! - No ! - Bethany , Bethany ! - Are you alright ? - What ? Yeah . I saw once , you know , - the girl Adrian was with . - You saw her ? What did she look like ? Naked ? Ouch . So , you actually caught ... Sorry ! No wonder you have nightmares . Not even really talked about it . I should 've been scream , or yell ... I should 've at least thrown something . That 's what women do in this situation , right ? I don 't know . Last time I had an argue with my husband he threw down the stairs and killed me . Yeah , I should have done that to him ! Hey , stop ! Binary ! Nielsen , hello ? Security , this is Colin , respond . Sommers ! Let go ! What 's going on ? - They have been breaching in the security , sir . - Get your hands of off me ! I 've seen you . You 're one of the protester , aren 't ? There he is ! You are fast little buger , are you ? I spot him around the corner , then he got away . - What are you doing down here ? - Nothing . Binary , check the organ labs , see if anything has been damaged . Yes , Mr. Sommers . What you creating down here is a abomination ! And exactly what are we creating ? Clone organs , clone people , that thing ! You 're using science to replace God 's creation ! On the contrary . I 'm a big fan of the divine . I 'm just a mechanic for what is broken . My daughter is not broken . You 're Samantha 's father . Your people came to my house today . Offered her cure . Offered to fix her with a ... clone spine ! Who are you to play God ? I saw your daughter a few hours ago . Crying for joy because she knew she 'd be able to walk again . She even thank God . But really , she was thanking me . Who am I ? I 'm the one your daughter turn to for a cure . To her ... I 'm God . CONTINUE ...

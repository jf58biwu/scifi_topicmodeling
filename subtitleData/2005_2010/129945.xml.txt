 Previously on Surface ... Dr. Circo made an important discovery . Adenine , glycine , kerotine . I know the origine of the species ! But Lee will protect secrecy at any cost . When Nimrod , the creature Miles raised , injured an officer ... Miles broke the law to protect him . Pursued by Lee ... forced into hiding ... Rich and Daughtery figured out where the creatures will gather ... Deep in the ocean . Can they find a way to get there ? Now Surface continues ... You have no idea how lucky you are . Do you realize what your father had to do to get us in this- - Congratulations . You have a police record . Dad ! Don 't speak . Just listen . From now on , this is how it 's gonna work . When your school day ends , your workday begins . Your sister 's gonna drive you from school to community service . And you 're gonna pick up trash , or recycle cans , or whatever else they ask you to do . For 16 hours a week , every week , Saturdays included . Each day you come home , go straight to your room . No internet , no TV , just your books . For how long ? The rest of the school year . That 's , like , seven months . Almost eight . Dad , we were just trying to protect Nim . It just--it just got a little out of hand . Really ? And at what point was that ? The carjacking ? The police chase ? They were gonna kill him . Oh , Miles , for god 's sake , don 't bring up that animal again . It 's true . That 's enough . Do you know how many favors I had to use up to get you out of there ? The gathering will take place on the 23rd . Which means we 've got four days to complete the submersible , and reach the dive site , which is 300 nautical miles off the coast of Oregon , where we will observe and document the creature in its natural ... I think we 're gonna make it . Ah ! I really do . And you still gotta- - we gotta top these valves off , and we 've gotta reinforce the eye-hooks for the tether ... Yeah . Fit the windows and get a hatch . Then we gotta sink it and test it . Oh , yeah make sure it 's airtight and leak-proof , so that pressure don 't turn us inside out . Now where you want these windows ? We can put one here on this side , and then the same on the other , and then one in the front . There ? Yeah . The real question is , where are we gonna get the windows ? Well , you know I got an idea for that . Yeah ? Oh , oh , okay , no , no , no . No way , no day . Huh ? Now I know it doesn 't look like much , but my uncle 's already sunk 1.5 million into this baby . Ah , come on . He 's got big plans for it . No , you 're not gonna cannibalize his boat . Are you kidding me , or ... ? No , definitely not kidding you . Jackson , we 're on the verge of witnessing an actual miracle . I mean , it 's the migration of a brand-new species . One that 's never been documented before , and you 're afraid about a couple pieces of glass from a junk boat ? Sorry , I 'm just , you know- - we have to do this . She 's right . Since you put it that way ... Very good . Give me my torch . You 're pretty handy with that thing . Yeah , where I come from metal shop ain 't really an elective . My electives were yachting and women 's studies . Really ? Man , if we 'd met in college , I think I 'd have to kick your ass . You went to college ? 72 hours ' til D-day , boys . How we doing ? Pressure release hatch . Whoa . That 's genius . I got more , I got a jigsaw , O2 tanks , and most importantly , the dead . The dead ? Hey , man , all right . Hope for you yet . All right , time for a test drive . 100 feet , and she is home . But see , I think we can have up to three things on both circuits , you know what I mean ? So a 12-volt , lead-acid battery should do it . A car battery ? Yeah , we 'll take a spare . But all we need to power is the hydrophone , the scrubber , and the lights . Right ? What 's with the tape ? Oh , it 'll protect the imaging in case of an electrical surge . If should we encounter one . Ha , maybe we 'd be so lucky . Was it dragging some ? I don 't know . It could be takin ' in water . All right , I see it . Easy ! Easy . All right , to the left a little bit . All right , right there , hold it , hold it . Go down , down . Just like the pits of Talladega , uh ? Wait , Rich , Rich , careful ! Rich , Rich . Are you okay ? Yeah . Oh , my god . Okay , ladies , I want this truck full . Let 's hustle it up . Piece of advice . Fill one bag an hour , you can fill ten . It still only counts as one hour . Nice jumpsuit , man . It matches your eyes . And very cool to adopt a highway like this . Yeah , maybe he can adopt my room . Maybe you could adopt a personality . Ooh . Easy there , tough guy . See , we rebels gotta stick together , man . No , man . I 'm not like you . Never will be . Looks like you missed some , bro . Let 's go , man . Come here . No , just someone I 'm trying to find . Baby , you know I can 't discuss my work . Beautiful , yes . But it 's not a flower ... it 's the future . How 's she looking ? Yeah , pretty dry , but I still- - I think we should pull the windows and check the gaskets and see if there 's any moisture there . I don 't know about that . That 's gonna take a while . And ... I pretty sure that leak came from the hatch . I don 't think we should assume anything . I mean that hose is like a squirt-gun compared to the pressure at 5,000 feet . We 'll see when we retest . Yeah , I don 't think there 's time for that . Yeah . Well , then we make time . No , there 's two days left . It 's gonna take us a day to get out to the dive site . Well , it 'll be a gravesite if the seal doesn 't hold . Look , I know what the problem was , all right ? I fixed it . Why don 't you grant the death wish on your own time , okay ? Why don 't you worry about driving the boat ? Guys , stop . Rich is right , okay ? I mean , if we miss this chance we might not get another one . Hey , I 've checked , and I 've rechecked . We 're good . She 's ready . You willing to bet your life on that ? Six months ? Isn 't there anything shorter ? Any shorter , and they say it might not take . Take ? It sounds like brainwashing . It 's wilderness therapy . And they 've had a lot of success with problem kids . Yeah , well , we 've never been apart for more than ten days . Yeah , you 're the one who wanted to send him away . Well , maybe I was wrong . He still doesn 't think he 's done anything wrong . He 's had no remorse . I know- - I know , I know . So we 're agreed on this . Yes . Is that for luck ? Yeah . It was George 's number . He played a little- - a little triple a ball out of school . Uh , ' til her tore his rotator cuff and ... yep . Little heat . What ? That 's what we called him . He was--he was a pitcher . " Little heat ? " Mmm-hmm . Well , li 'l heat . So you gonna do it ? Hmm ? You gonna bet your life on this thing ? I gotta . For George . Rich ... Hmm ? Are you still seeing those holes ? So clear I could jump in ' em . No champagne , but I found rum , or ... rum . Would you do the honors ? Oh . Um ... yeah . Wait , wait , wait , wait . She needs a name . Ah . Oh , okay . I christen thee , " li 'l heat " . Ok . Mornin ' , sunshine . You can 't send him away . What ? You can 't send Miles to that camp . That 's not your business . We think it 's gonna help him , Savannah . So what ? He screwed up . He 's a kid . That 's what we do . Your mother and I have thought long and hard about this . You can 't really ... Yeah , but you don 't know ! Know what ? Forget it . Savannah ... I had a small- - very small party while you guys were in Mexico . That 's when I found out that Miles was- - keeping that whatever it is . What ? You 've known about it the whole time ? And you didn 't say anything ? No . It gave me a leverage . Savannah ... I saw him with that thing , you know . And he was different . Not the usual apathetic , I 'm-so-bored-Miles . This Miles was interested . Like I 've never seen him before in his life . He cared . And for that , you 're gonna send him away ? Jackson ? It 's not- - I don 't hear anything . It 's a satellite phone . Give it a second to work . All right . Hold up , hold up . All right , we 're good . All right , it 's good . Hello ? Shawn . Hi . Hey . It 's me . Everything okay ? It 's fine . I 'm going out tomorrow . And I just wanted to let you know . Where ? It 's a couple hundred miles off the coast of Oregon . I 'll be back on Wednesday , and I 'll call you then . If you don 't hear from me Yeah , I 've got the Coast Guard 's number on the fridge . Um , is Jesse there ? Yeah , sure . Jess , it 's your mom . Hey , mom . Where are you ? Hi , peanut ! Um , yeah , I 'm not far away . Are you still looking for it ? Yeah , I 'm still looking for it . I--I just wanted to call you and tell you that I love you in case that you forgot . I 'll never forget . There 's someone at the door . Okay . Then go to the door . Okay . Bye-bye , mom . Okay , bye . Dad , who is it ? Hello , Jesse . We want to talk to Dr. Daughtery regarding two deaths . Both of which have been ruled a homicide . Aren 't these , um , Federal credentials you have here ? The victims were Pentagon employees . And she 's a suspect , or- - ? She was present at one of the crime scenes . When ? Five nights ago . That 's um- - that 's when she came by . She dropped Jesse off . You know where she may have gone ? No . She say when she 'd be back ? No , she didn 't . She 's been acting very strange , but ... Has she called ? Tried to contact you in any way ? No . You know , I can subpoena your phone records , and perjury is a crime . Okay ... she hasn 't called . Nim . We 've got some weather . Storm coming , or- - ? Can 't say . Where ? Could I see ? There 's no storm clouds . Hey , what 's this ? What ? Made some adjustments last night , couldn 't sleep . These bang sticks ? Yeah , for protection , 44 caliber heads . You know , I--I don 't wanna hurt them . And I don 't want you eaten by them . Okay ? Delicate balance . Emergency lifeboat . Compressor runs off the battery . If you have to surface quickly , you flip the switch inside , and then the boat inflates . Thanks , Jackson . Hang on , ya 'll come over here for a second . Let me say a few words . Come on . Well , here we are , lord . We know you brought us all here for a reason . So , we 're ready . Willing to go all the way . And we know that whatever 's down there is bigger than us all , so , take us on your hand , lord . And lead us to the truth . And if it ain 't too much to ask , bring us home in one piece . Amen . Amen . Amen . Let 's do it . All good ? All good . Here we go . All leaks and grounds are normal . Scrubber 's scrubbing , the O2 bleed is ... one . One liter per minute . Copy . All systems sat . Increasing descent to 60 meters per minute . Hey . Hey . Oh , it 's a new pressure seal . Once we get down a few hundred feet it should lock into place . See ? Hatch secure . Okay , copy that . Enjoy the ride . Forgot your lunch . I sense an al--alterior motive . No . I just wanna come and let you know I told the ' rents about your pet . Shut up . No , really , I did . And , shocker , they believed me . Well , a little too late . You miss it , don 't you ? Look , you don 't have to pretend to give a damn . I 'm not . Really . I just- - I felt bad for you . It was like when mom made me give up my hamster . They didn 't try to kill your hamster . True , but my hamster never tried killing anyone either . Why couldn 't they just see what he was ? Ron and Sylvia are never gonna see that . They hate that thing . But ... well , they see what it meant to you . What 's this ? Dad hooked you up . Got you moved into a different community work area . You start today . Entering the photic zone . All conditions sat . Uh , yeah , copy . Same here . Yeah , I tell you , the clarity on that thing 's incredible , ain 't it ? Yeah , I know . I mean , we 're the only ones talking down here . And sound travels five times faster in water . I wish my girls could see this . Here come the fireworks . Oh , my god . It 's amazing , right ? Humans are two-thirds water . Just like the earth . The percentage of salt in our blood is the same percentage of salt in the ocean . We are tied to the sea . Maybe we are . It 's like coming home . You 'll clean the leavings from the touch-tank . Leavings ? Well , fecal matter mostly . But kids lose stuff in there too . Gum , toys , occasionally their lunch . We pump in 2,000 gallons of fresh seawater per minute . Filters have to be checked every day . Make sure no one 's stuck in there . After cleaning , you move on to feeding . This is the food prep area . The locals eat 300 pounds per day . What 's she doing ? Making sushi . For the invertebrates . They love this stuff . You wanna feed the rays ? Sure . Southern sting-rays . Relative of the shark . Can smell food in the water from a mile away . Take it . They don 't get live fish ? The mackerel 's fortified with vitamins . It 's better for them . Now , don 't just drop it in . Yeah , I know . You gotta wiggle it around . They key off movement . That 's right . Pretty amazing creatures . I guess . I mean , something no one 's ever seen before . That 's--that 's amazing . Right ? Okay , depth at 1,700 feet . Interior temperature is 75 degrees Fahrenheit . And the exterior temperature is 65 degrees . Jackson , can you ping the bottom for me ? Check that . Just about 4,300 feet . 10-15 minutes , and you 're there . Copy that . We 're getting close . Crap . What ? Probably just condensation . Or not . Turns out that leak was not the hatch . Don 't tell me . Don 't tell me that . The window . Jackson , what are you doing ? The deeper you get , the longer it 's gonna take me to get you back up . We can repair and re-launch . No , no , no , no , no . No , negative . We are not stopping . Hang on , hang on . We have to ! You 're taking on water ! The weather 's getting nasty . If I leave you down any longer Negative , Jackson , we 're not stopping ... I have to bring you guys up right now . You don 't understand . You- - you haven 't seen the weather up here . Plus , you do not wanna mess around at this depth . Trust me . Do you read me ? Rich ? Daughtery ? Respond . If you guys don 't come back , I have to bring you up . Are you listening to me ? Respond ! Daughtery ! Do you read me ! We 're good , brother . We 've made our decision . Cut us loose . I 'm gonna regret this . You kinda dig this stuff , don 't you ? Yeah . Come on , I wanna show you something cool . I 've been working here for almost six years . So I pretty much have the keys to lock up the place . What are these ? Quarantine tanks . It 's where we try and breed various species , or where we put the animals the locals bring us . That happen a lot ? Oh , yeah . Sea turtles , sharks , everything . Like this . A woman brought in these a couple days ago . They 're infertile . I mean , can you imagine what must 've come out of this thing ? Uh ... yeah . How 's that leak ? Same . Golly , it is like a sauna in here . Man , what is going on ? I thought it was supposed to be cooler . Well , it should be . Um , Jackson ? Do you have any of Cirko 's thermographic scans up there ? Yeah , affirmative . What do you need ? Um , can you check and see if there 's any hydrothermal vents or smokers or anything ? Negative . Oh , the heat 's gotta be coming from somewhere . Hey . There ! Yeah , slow the line , Jackson . Slow the line . Okay , copy . Okay , yeah . That 's good . That is a whole lot bigger than the ones at the San Juan de Fuca plate . Cirko , what were you on to ? Uh , five times faster , huh ? So , how close was that ? I gotta get my camera . Let me get my camera . Right there . See ? Southeast , there 's , um , there 's , like , eight or nine of them ? You better double that . This is doctor Laura Daughtery and Rich Connelly , 4,000 feet below the surface amidst a pod of the new vertebrates . Their--their lengths range from 100 feet to 175 . What are they doing ? I think ... they 're breeding . Hey . Dad . I thought mom was picking me up . Uh , I was in the neighborhood . Um , how is it here ? It 's good . Better than picking up trash . Learn anything ? Uh , yeah . Did you know that we 've identified less than 10 % of the species in the ocean ? A lot we don 't understand , huh ? Yeah . That 's true . I ... I 've seen that before . What ? It 's--that hole . And that light . This is it . What--what the hell ? Oh , my god . Whoa ! Hold on , Jackson . Slow us down , please . We 're dropping fast . Jackson , do you copy ? We 're falling way too fast . You gotta pull us back up . You gotta stop us . Oh , my gosh . You all right ? Okay . Rich , don 't move . Jackson ? Do you hear me , Jackson ? Wait , wait , what 's that ? What is it ? What is it ? What is that ? The cable 's snapped . We have to get the raft . We have to get the raft floating . We have to make this work . The cable 's snapped . Okay , I gotta find a flash . Okay . We need to get the battery going . The battery 's fried , so , I 'm gonna get the reserve , go in here . Are you gonna help me with this ? Okay . Yeah . Uh-oh . What ? Oh , god . This is all part of it . Part of what ? This is part of what 's supposed to happen . There are 3,000 feet of cable out there . Nearly two tons ! It 's not an accident . Yeah , but we have to- - Listen , you just have to trust me . You just have to trust me , okay ? What are you doing ? It 's gonna pull us down , Rich . I know . Oh , god .

 No , man , whatever . You 're wrong . Admit you 're wrong . No , she didn 't . What ? Well , then she 's a bigger idiot than you are , Which is impossible . It is impossible . I 'm really good at math . It 's impossible . All right , cool . Late . We 'll be back around 10 : 00 . Make sure to take bucky out . you hear me ? I love you . That scared me . Me too . Your turn . Okay . Ella , when you said you brushed your teeth , Did you also completely dry your toothbrush ? I brushed . Ella . I just love being lied to . Hey , you 're a tough mother . Ella 's a sweetheart . She is a sweetheart . She 's a lying little sweetheart . Sure minds me as you ? Oh ! I 'm gonna go make sure she 's brushing her teeth . With all due respect , Darwin got it all wrong . I used to make the joke that darwin 's thinking was rather ... unevolved . Which I 'm sure used to be very funny . For a brilliant man , Darwin was occasionally a moron . he claimed that males tried to spread their genes By having sex constantly . However , the females , with limited eggs , were more selective in their attempts to find genetically superior males . I believe that darwin was simply inaccurate , that females can be just as aggressive as males , with males equally dispassionate . Thoughts ! Peter ? - This is Astrid . - Hey , it 's me . can you have the guys go outside ? I 'm sending over a body . Yeah . Yeah , I 'll have them waiting outside . - Thank you . - Okay . Hey , that was Olivia . She needs you guys outside . A coroner 's on his way with a body . You know , this is the part of day That I look forward to most ... when I know there 's something bizarre out there . I just don 't know what it is . Like a grab bag of disturbing events , Don 't you think ? Yeah . Be right back , Agent Farnsworth . Okay . Bye . Thank you for taking the time . We know you 're grieving . We 're very sorry about your loss . What the hell could have done that to him ? We don 't know yet . But we 'll find out . Did you notice anything strange In your son 's behavior over the last few days ? No . School is good . He was looking forward to graduating . We had dinner together almost every night . We tried to get a few syllables out about his day . Any history of drug use ? No . I know all parents think that , But in Greg 's case , it 's true . Whatever happened ... He didn 't bring it on himself . What about any ... Preexisting medical conditions ? Asthma . I blame it for all the time he spends on the computer . Was he on the computer last night ? Most nights . He spends all his free time there playing games , trading songs . He chats about girls with his friends . Which friends ? Uh ... Luke , probably . Luke Dempsey . E-y ? Yeah . We 're gonna do everything we can to find out what happened to your son . He can be rotated onto his back now , Drain the remainder of his brain . Once that 's done , We can examine his cranial cavity . Oh , this is gonna be awesome . Just get me everything you can and call me right back . Thanks . Everything okay ? yeah , his parents say he was a good kid . what do we know from the autopsy ? All I know for sure Is that his brain matter has been completely liquefied . How ? My first thought Is an extremely virulent form of syphilis . you 're saying that his brain Could have been cooked by an std ? Safe sex is important . You do always have your sexual partners wear a condom , I hope . Walter ... Well , if he got this from a girl or some kind of drug that he was experimenting with , there may be a record of that on his computer . Astrid , can you check his hard drive ? I had it transferred with some of his other effects . I got it right here . I 'm on it . Oh , and be sure to check his floppy disks as well . Floppy disks are a little outdated . Why don 't you focus on what you do best ? All yours ... liquid brains . Oh . Fantastic . I will get the bone saw ! Hey , check this out . What ? Something 's wrong . The hard drive platters must be fused . You sure ? Linguistics major . Computer science minor . Plus , I 've been taking computers apart Since I was , like , six . So do you think you can get anything off this ? Uh ... I know some pretty aggressive Data retrieval techniques . I can give it a shot . Well , I 'm gonna go interview that Dempsey kid And see if I can dig up something else on the victims . Call me as soon as you find something . Excuse me . I 'm looking for Luke Dempsey . Thank you . Luke Dempsey ? Olivia Dunham . FBI . Can I have a word ? I was just talking with Greg last night . What happened to him ? To be honest , we 're not entirely sure . What did you two talk about ? A bunch of stuff . I got him a deal on a split rear exhaust for his ' 93 gt . told him he could swing by whenever . And after ... a couple hours , He just ... he stopped answering . I figured he fell asleep . How do the two of you know each other ? Our dads worked together when we were kids , And , uh ... Greg and I stayed friends . Can you think of anyone Who may have wanted to hurt Greg ... Or maybe had a grudge against him ? You think ... somebody killed him ? Do you ? Dunham . It 's Peter . we just got a call about another body . Sir . Dunham . The general manager of this dealership was found dead by an employee . - We have the employee ? - Yeah . Though he 's having a hard time being coherent . Well , what exactly happened ? Bishop . Doctor . It appears he died the same way as the teenager in Springfield . Prepare six vials , please . Yes , sir . Where 's the guy who found him ? This way . Anton 's a nice man . Honest guy . He has three kids . When was the last time you saw him alive ? Last night . There 's a bar we go to sometimes . Strip club . My wife doesn 't know . Just ... please don 't judge me . I 'm not judging you . Oh ! What ? He 's dead . He can 't feel this . I wonder if they sell cars here With those seats that warm your ass . Why don 't you ask ' em ? Hmm ? Maybe I will . Anton 's worked here as long as you have ? A little longer than that , actually . He 's been here for three years . And is there anyone you can think of That would want to hurt him ? Anton ? No way . He 's solid . Can I take your card In case I need to ask you some more questions ? Yeah , sure , um ... My cell 's on there . And if you 're ever interested in a new vehicle , We have next year 's models in , so , um ... Now you are judging me . It 's the weirdest thing . The fused platters We found on the car salesman 's computer ... They 're fried just like the kid 's . Well , that can 't be a coincidence . I 'm trying to recover as much data as possible . These platters are incredibly sensitive . A speck of dust is enough to make them unusable . But this ? It looks like someone took a blowtorch to them . And from what I was able to pull so far , It looks like both the computers downloaded a huge file ... 657 megabytes each right before they crashed . Where 'd the file come from ? It 's a miracle I was able to salvage this much . To figure that out , I 'd need another couple days To access the ISP servers . That 's time that we don 't have . Is it you ? Mm-mm . I haven 't heard that sound for ages . I think it 's the phone . Who would have that number ? It must be on Harvard 's system . I didn 't even know it worked . Hello ? There 's nobody here by that name . Yes , I 'm sure . Sorry . I think you got the wrong number . Who was it ? Some ... student looking for financial aid . What are you doing ? I think ... I got a guy who can help us . Who ? You really wanna know ? Good point . Be careful with that , though , ' cause it 's evidence . Just kiddin ' . Okay , I 'm gonna go talk to Greg Wiles 's friend , Luke Dempsey . Agent Dunham ? I think I might know who 's just on the phone . How 's it going , Akim ? Peter Bishop . Long time . Not long enough ... Play nice . I come bearing gifts . My god . I can 't believe you kept it . You could have sold this for a fortune . I kept it to remind me never to wager with anything That I couldn 't bear to live without . I can have it back ? Sure . First ... I 'm gonna need some help . What do you got ? Just before they fried , both of these drives downloaded the same program . Very good . And what are we looking for ? I wanna know what it is and where it came from . Agent Dunham . I hear Agent Broyles has you investigating The bridgepoint automotive death . May I ask what exactly you 're looking for ? I 'll be cross-referencing the victim 's medical records with the AMA database , looking for anything that might connect him to the teenager and explain what happened here . Medical records , ama database , liquefied brains . Come on , Dunham . This case clearly falls under the jurisdiction of the CDC ! - Qualified , knowledgeable , scientists ... - There was no known pathogen , - no signs of a contagion . - who see these things every day ! With all due respect , agent Harris , I have done my due diligence . I just got off the phone with my contact at the CDC , and they have seen nothing like it . But you tell me , does this look like a flu you 've heard of where people 's brains come out their ears ? No . No . This looks like yet another excuse to justify the allocation of FBI resources . To what 's arguably become a rogue division inside a federal agency , operating , if not completely autonomously , then well outside the standard regulatory purview . I have news for you , agent Dunham . I 'm here to remedy that . I 'll consider myself warned . 12 hours . After that , I shut you down and put the case in what I believe will be considerably more capable hands . - Whoa . - What 's this ? It 's particles scattered all over the internet . This thing must have been insanely complex . Integrated video , audio . I mean , some of this isn 't even computer code . Is that even possible ? Multiple parallel packet routing . Ten times the usual nodes . Whoever sent this is trying very hard to cover their tracks . Akim , come on . You have no idea where this thing came from . Nothing yet . There 's too many paths . Wait a second . Okay , I ... I can 't tell you where it 's originating , but I got a destination . This program 's being downloaded right now , real time . Then that 's the next target . Neighborhood in Brighton , near Boston . It 's close by . Brighton ? Can you pull up the address ? Honing in . There . That 's where it 's going . Oh , my god . Dunham . Olivia , listen to me ... just before they died , both the victims downloaded the same transmission , - and it 's happening again right now . - where ? - Your apartment . Hey , I just turned right onto broadway . I should be there in five minutes . Uh , look , Rachel 's not picking up her cell ... Then call the next door neighbor . I don 't know any of the neighbors . I haven 't seen any of them for months . Then call boston PD . I already have . Mom . Mom ! One minute , Ella . Olivia , what the hell are you doing ? Okay ... is there someone else here ? Of course not . It 's just us . Ella ? Ella , everything 's gonna be okay . - You okay ? - Yeah . - Can you check out the back ? - Yeah . Ella ! Ella . Ella . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing is wrong , Olivia . She 's just playing her game , right , Ell ? Ella ! Ella ... sweetie ! Ella . Ella ! Aunt Liv ? When did you get home ? I don 't understand . What happened ? There were flashes on the computer screen When I first came in , like bursts of images . I don 't know . I can 't explain it . It was like nothing I had ever seen before . Images . Yeah . And they affected Ella in some way , like she was hypnotized . I 'm gonna call computer forensics . They 'll be here right away . Trot , trot to boston , trot , trot to lynn . Better watch out , or you might fall in ! Do you do birthday parties too ? Not so much , no . Though I have done my fair share of babysitting lately . Yeah , well , the way you are with Ella , It seems like you 'd be really good . At a party . I 'm not really familiar with the word . Maybe you can talk to your sister , She can give me the weekend off . My sister 's not really the weekend off type . That was always more me . Everything okay ? - Yeah . - Ella , come here . What are you doing ? You need to get her checked out as soon as possible . What are you talking about ? She 's fine . Look at her . I 'm sure everything 's fine . Liv , what is going on ? There was a hand . I remember . There was a hand coming out of the computer . Okay , uh ... We 're definitely cutting back on the sugar intake and possibly our visits with aunt Olivia . - Come on , sweetie . - Hold on a second . Hold on a second . What kinda hand , Ella ? Weird ... Glowy ... Scary . Ell , this isn 't funny . Look at me . You know how I feel about lying . I 'm not ! It really happened ! How ? I don 't know . I was playing with my game , and I saw this hand . Which game was it ? My ponies . I don 't want you on that site again , okay ? Promise ? That 's right , sweetheart . I 'm the one you 're looking for . Who 's there ? It ... it 's just me , dad . Somebody in here ? I heard voices . Talking to myself . What are you doin ' here ? Thought I 'd bring you some lunch . Thanks . How are things at the body shop , Luke ? Fine . Have you found a job yet , dad ? Who says I 'm looking for one ? I went by your place . The mail was all piled up . Mrs. Greely said you haven 't been home in over a week . She should mind her own business . Have you been sleeping here , dad ? Luke ... Thanks for the food , but ... I should be getting back to this . W ... what is it that you 're working on ? A new program . I don 't wanna jinx it . I think it 's gonna impress a lot of people . Okay , love you . Bye . How 's Ella doing ? The doctor says she 's perfectly healthy . There 's no sign of neurological damage , nothing . That 's excellent news . Charlie 's taking them back . He 's gonna keep an eye on the apartment until I get there . God , if something had of happened to her ... But it didn 't . Don 't torture yourself with hypotheticals . She 's fine . Yeah . This is gonna sound crazy but I think whoever 's responsible was watching through the computer . What ? The light next to the camera was on , and Ella doesn 't know how to use it . You think he was spying on you ? I don 't know . Maybe he was trying to scare me . He knows about the investigation , and this is his sick way of telling me to back off . I suppose he could have broken into our network , learned you were investigating his case ... Which means maybe we can track him . Well , we have forensics on it as we speak . Also , I 've got a ... subcontractor that I 've worked with before . He 's trying to track down the origin of the data stream that was sent to Olivia 's computer . And this ... data stream , you think it may be connected to what killed those people ? The victim , Greg Wiles , was found in front of his computer too , and his hard drive was fused , just like the car salesman . A computer program that can ... Kill people . Yeah , I know . But Walter 's working on it right now back at the lab . But here 's what I don 't understand . If a person is responsible for those deaths , why are they killing ? Have you found any connection between the victims ? Not yet . Mark ? Honey ? Can you help me with the groceries ? John and Alice are coming over for dinner . You remember ? Thought I 'd make a roast . Hey , Dow Jones . Are you alive in there ? Mark ? Mark ... It 's amazing , isn 't it ? All these people , and they don 't have a clue ... How crazy it all really is . The world ... Everything . If we do our job , they 'll never have to . Olivia Dunham . We got another death . this one , outside Chicago , is a day trader . It 's happened again . When are you going to start calling them murders ? When you find us a murderer . Well , send me everything you can on the victim . Will do . Okay . I 'll meet you inside , okay ? Are you Jessica Warren ? Yes . I 'm Peter Bishop . I know . I read your letter . And I can understand , of course , why it is that you want to see my father . It 's not the right time for him . He 's only been out of the institution for a couple of months . After 17 years ... And three months , Mr. Bishop . I know exactly how long it 's been . I 'm sure you do . I 'm very sorry for what happened , Mrs. Warren . I wish this weren 't the case , but nothing will bring your daughter back ... Not even talking to my father . I need to see him . To do what ? To blame him for the accident ? It 's between me and your father . I 'm sorry . It 's not going to happen . Hey . Hey . I 'm glad Ella 's okay . Oh . Thank you . Oh , agent Dunham . I think I worked out how these deaths occurred . It 's a complex combination of visual and subsonic aural stimuli ingeniously designed to amplify the electrical impulses of the brain , trapping it in an endless loop . Walter ? It 's like a computer virus that infects people . I don 't understand . Ella said she saw a hand coming out of the computer . A hallucinatory effect of the stimuli , perhaps . I need to research further . Hey . Where 's the latest victim ? Uh ... just outside of Chicago . Any motive yet ? Not yet . Listen ... I think I know who that woman was ... outside . What do you think you know ? That she 's the mother of the lab assistant that was killed in the fire here almost 20 years ago . It 's none of my business . Go ahead . What ? Does Walter know ? That she wants to see him ? Of course Walter doesn 't know . He couldn 't handle it . I see . You think that he could ? I don 't know why , but I do . You really think it 's a good idea to put him through that ? Well , I was thinking that it 's all unresolved . For him , for her , and I was thinking that it must be hard for her too , to come back here to the place where she lost her daughter . What 's your point ? That you underestimate him , your father , And you shouldn 't . Here is what Charlie was able to dig up on the last victim . " Mark Rosenthal . 48 . Married . " Any information on his next of kin ? It 's sad , actually . He just got married last year to a ... A Miriam Dempsey . I have her number here if you want it . - Did you say Dempsey ? - Mm-hmm . I interviewed a Luke Dempsey this morning . He was friends with the teenage victim Greg Wiles . Uh ... according to this background info , Miriam Dempsey is Luke 's mother . So that would make the last victim Luke 's stepfather . Yeah . What are the chances of the same kid being connected to both victims ? Maybe Luke is a killer . It 's possible , but ... he seemed genuinely upset when I told him his friend was dead . He did mention something else . He said that the reason he was friends with the victim was because their fathers worked together . Is everything all right ? I heard you and agent Dunham . From the tone , it sounded like you were having an argument . Everything 's fine . I tried to expense a couple of Celtic tickets on the FBI ... she caught me . Oh , I see . I hope she doesn 't notice the $ 2,000 for the baboon seminal fluid I ordered . I hope I can recall why I ordered it . What 's up ? I think we have our suspect . " Brian Dempsey . " He used to work for Paul Wiles . Greg 's dad ? Exactly . He was Dempsey 's boss until he fired Dempsey six years ago . According to Wiles , he was a programmer , way ahead of his time . Wiles said when he fired him , Brian threw a fit . Yeah , and the victim outside Chicago was married to Dempsey 's ex-wife . Really nasty divorce too . What about the car salesman ? Uh , we 're still looking for that connection . But it looks like Dempsey 's m.o. is to hurt people who screwed him over by going after their loved ones . Charlie . Yeah . It 's me . I need you to get to Brian Dempsey 's house . Luke 's father . I think he 's our guy . Dunham , where 's our suspect ? There was no sign of him at home . We picked up his son from work . What 's your plan ? We 're waiting for the right moment . Well , why wait ? Just go in and break him . I ... I 'm not sure that 's the way to go . You care to share your reasoning ? I think that Luke suspects there 's something wrong with his father . If we go in heavy-handed , then ... he could shut down Or call a lawyer , and then ... He won 't tell us anything . It 's your job to make sure that doesn 't happen . I 'm more than familiar with passive coercion . Good . Then find his pressure points , Put your little hands around him , and squeeze . That 's an order . Every time that guy opens his mouth , I like him more and more . So ? Come on . Luke . This is Agent Francis . Where 's your father ? No idea . Tell me about him . Uh , what do you wanna know ? He had a pretty rough ride . Smart . Maybe a little too smart for his own good . couldn 't hold down a job , then he gets dumped by your mom . that couldn 't have been easy . People don 't understand him . They don 't take the time . When did you see him last ? Few weeks ago . We aren 't really close . Have you spoken to your mom recently ? Do you know what happened to your stepfather ? And , uh , I told you about Greg myself . Come on , Luke . The only thing that these victims have in common , besides having their brains liquefied , was that they were all close to someone who pissed off your father . This guy died because he married your mother . And your friend Greg here , he died because his dad fired your dad . That 's impossible ! The horror show in this picture was a friend of yours . You wanna cover it up now ? No ! I want a lawyer . D-don 't I get a lawyer ? Is it any consolation knowing you were right ? Do me a favor . Wait five minutes , then release him . What about Harris ? Screw him . My thoughts exactly . Okay , come on . What did I miss ? Just trust me . Yeah , I need a cab . I need to hear that call . Thank you . ... 2 Braddock street . One person going to 1432 braddock street . I 'll have a car there in ten minutes . Ten minutes , right ? All right , thanks . He just called a cab . One guess where it 's taking him . Oh , come on . He cannot possibly be that stupid . He 's 19 . Good point . I don 't underestimate my father , by the way . I understand him . sometimes more than I want to . Look , if I let him talk to that woman , She 's just going to accuse him of killing her daughter , which is something that he didn 't do . Then why not just let them meet ? Whose side are you on anyway ? I know what it 's like to live with something unresolve ... that 's all . Congratulations ... you just described the entire planet . This could provide closure for your father . He 's had to live with the death of that woman . He got put away because of it . Who 's to say that this wouldn 't be a resolution for him ? If I didn 't know better , I 'd think you actually wanted the man to have a nervous breakdown ! Then maybe you don 't know better , because I care for your father too . And I believe that shielding him from the truth , from what 's real , ultimately does him a disservice . What 's real doesn 't really seem to concern Walter . And what you said earlier about this being none of your business , that was right on the money . Okay , you stay here . You are not going in there alone . Just stay here and watch the entrance . Will you at least call for backup ? Harris wants me to screw this up . If I call for help , He 's gonna do whatever it takes to make me look bad . Where the hell are Dunham and the kid ? I have no idea , sir . Hey ! Trace the GPS on Dunham 's car . I wanna know where she is now ! W-why the hell would you do that ? He was a friend of mine ! His has a bad family , Luke . They were cruel people . You actually ... you actually killed Greg from here ? Now ... how many more , dad ? Who else , huh ? All they had to do was give me a chance , a fair shake , a chance to prove myself . But they thought they could just drop me to the curb like a piece of garbage . Son ... No ! No ! So all this is supposed to fix that ? I don 't know who you are anymore , dad ! I used to look up to you . And now ... you 're pathetic . Go ! They 're coming for me , not for you . - Dad ... - Go ! Stay right where you are . You ruined everything . People were gonna respect me ... Respect my work . Now my son hates me because of you . But this is how it ends . Stay back , or I 'll kill you , too . It was their fault ... all of them ! I just wanted them to feel the pain that they made me feel . Just put the gun down . Why should you care whether I live or die ? Especially when you know what I 've done . Mr. Dempsey , look away from the screen . No . I wanna see . I wanna finally see ... my creation . Stop right there ! Hey there , Luke . Shut up . Leave my father alone . Luke , take it easy . Stay back ! Dunham ! You okay ? Luke ... Luke ... - What did you do to him ? - No , I didn 't ... He went into a trance and he shot himself . Freeze ! On your knees , son . I don 't get it . He knew he was killing those people . Why would the kid protect a murderer like that ? Because it 's his father . Sanford . Interesting day . So I hear . For the record your agent disobeyed a direct order of mine , released Luke Dempsey , and then attempted to apprehend the suspect without backup . From what I can tell , agent Dunham closed this case in spite of your obstructions . She violated too many aspects of FBI protocol to even count ! She IDed a murderer , contained a computer program that melts people 's brains ... - Listen to me , Phillip ... - No , you listen to me . What you 're passing off as bureaucratic concern looks an awful lot like a personal vendetta , and if you push it , I will stake my career on her behalf . Are you threatening me , Phillip ? You decide to go after Olivia Dunham , you 're going after me , and all the red tape in the world won 't protect you . You sure you 're up for this ? I got a lotta red tape , Phillip . Walter . There 's a woman here who wants to talk to you . She pretty ? She 's right there . Now , look ... If you need me , I 'll be right here . If you need to end the conversation for any reason , you just say the word . My daughter 's name was Carla Warren . Oh , dear . Do you remember her ? Yes . I want to see you because you were the last person to see my daughter alive , and I 've always wanted to ask ... Was there anything else I could know ? Anything , anything else you could tell me about my daughter . She was a wonderful girl . What I remember is her smile . She had a wonderful smile . I miss Carla . Me , too . I miss her . I 'll tell you everything I remember about our time together . Part of me wants to ask you to explain what happened with Ella . But I 'm not sure I 'll feel safer if I know . You wouldn 't . How do you do it , Liv ? I brushed . Fantastic . Say good night . Okay , come here and give me a kiss . On the cheek . I tricked you . Okay . Good night , sweetheart . Night . Hi . What 's up ? First of all , I 've had a couple of drinks , but don 't worry ... I walked over . Okay . And , uh ... I wanted to say that ... I 've never had him in my life ... Walter . And now , thanks to your insane freak show of an operation , I do . Have him in my life . And I think that I was ... I think that I was a little scared . And maybe if he ... he talked to that woman ... Whatever . I I wanted to say that I 'm sorry . You were right . Thank you . You 're welcome . Hi . Hi . How 's Ella doing ? Good . Thanks . Liv , she wants you to tuck her in . Okay . So I 'll see you tomorrow . Yeah .

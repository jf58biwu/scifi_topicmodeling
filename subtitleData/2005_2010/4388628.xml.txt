 Previously on Heroes . You 're just gonna round us all up , get rid of us ? I 'm looking for you to tell me you 're with me . I can 't do that . I 'm gonna fight you with every breath that I have . I swear to God . What are you doing ? Sorry , Mohinder . I came to warn you . You 're in danger . I heard Angela and Nathan talking about sending someone to take you down . Hiro . Who am I ? You were given to me . By whom ? My brother . Is he still alive ? Mr. Gray ? Who are you ? Agent Daniel Simmons . Looks like you and I need to have a little talk . Tell me . Where is my father ? Claire , I 've given you a free pass . Don 't make me change my mind . We 're gonna make an unexpected landing . Claire ? Den Mother 3-1 going down , bearing 2-4-5 at 9-8 off Walnut Ridge VORTAC . We have lost pressure ! Mayday , mayday ! Did I wake you ? No , not yet . Well , it 's not good . Claire got on board somehow , and all hell broke loose . No . The pilot managed an emergency landing , but the plane broke apart when it hit the ground . Some of the prisoners escaped . Wait . Please . Be quiet . Hiro , how did you get here ? Did you get your powers back ? No . I 'm powerless . The hero 's path is never easy . If we stay here , we 're dead . We have to keep moving . Yes . Save the others . - Where are they ? - I saw them running . Peter Petrelli . The cheerleader . It is our duty to save them ... Don 't you get it ? Powers alone aren 't going to cut it with these guys . They were ready for us . All of us . Then what do we do ? The sun will be up soon . There 's more trees and cover that way . Come on . Matt ? Matt ? Where are you going ? I can 't believe this is happening . My father , your brother . It 's not just Nathan . He 's got the whole government . We need to hide . Come on . I can 't let you do that , sweetheart . You both need to come with me . Let me go . Let me go . This is insane . What happened to you ? How can you be a part of this ? It 's much more complicated than you know . Are you gonna shoot me , Bennet ? In front of your daughter ? Dad ? What are you doing ? Run , Peter . You 're never gonna get away with this . The crash . People are gonna ask questions . You 're wrong . Nobody 's gonna know a thing . What did you do ? I got to the site as soon as I heard . It was a nightmare . It was totally out of control . No . It wasn 't just the crash . Danko , he was in my face from the second I hit the ground . Why the hell did you authorize an air strike ? It 's standing protocol , Senator . I don 't need your permission . Permission ? This is my operation . Not out here it isn 't . I 've got civilians at risk . The second that crash happened , your prisoners were re-designated terrorists . You mean targets ? Shoot to kill . That 's your tactical , elegant solution ? These people of yours are dangerous . These people are going into custody . We 're not assassins . You have a rabid dog , you don 't put a chain around its neck and pray for miracles . You put it down . When did the rules of engagement change ? This isn 't some exercise in tactics , Senator . Your daughter turned a simple transport flight into a national security emergency . I 'll deal with Claire . You do that . And I 'll do my job . Peter . Tracy , come on . We gotta keep moving ... I can 't do this . What are you talking about ? I 'm not some " thing . " My life was finally getting back to normal . Okay , well , stop , stop . You stay here , and they will catch you . Now , come on . Why ? Why would Nathan do this to us ? I don 't know . But I 'm gonna find a way to stop him . This is a nightmare . Okay . You stay here , and he wins . You come with me and you can fight . Come on . Maybe these people can help us . What is he doing ? We 're not thieves . The trance is compelling him . Let 's just let him go . What should we do ? Come on . Focus , Parkman . Put these on . We need to blend in . I 'll take their address . Send money later . Nemesis ? It 's me . How did you find me ? Hiro told me about your super-secret hideout . Of course . Best way to keep a secret , tell everyone . Is something wrong ? It 's Matt . He didn 't come home last night . He didn 't call . He always calls . I didn 't know who else to turn to . Wait , Hiro 's missing also . He 's kidnapped . Maybe same thing happened to Matt . I 've got to find him . I think he was taken to Arkansas . How do you know that ? Because Hiro and I have GPS trackers . Of course you do . He 's near Russellville , Arkansas . I was trying to buy a ticket to fly there . Why fly when you can run ? You lost your ability ? How ? It is complicated . And unfortunate . From what I 've heard , it would have been quite useful today . It wasn 't my fault . Now even Ando has a power . But he has no idea how to be a hero . Then your friend Ando should stay as far away from here as possible . And so should you . You think I should leave ? Find a policeman , turn yourself in . No . I must help my friends . It is my duty . Not any more . If you tell them your powers are gone , they may let you go . Surrender ? Never . I am a warrior . This is not your fight any more , Hiro . Save yourself while you still can . Hey . When did you learn to draw ? I didn 't . It just happened . Well , do you have any idea what they mean ? Nemesis ? No . That 's Daphne at the crash site . Matt , that 's not possible . She wasn 't even on the plane . Is this India ? You 're right . All right . This is nuts . I don 't want this . Matt , they will find us here . We have to go . No , I ... If these visions are real , then Daphne 's in trouble . I gotta get back . That 's insane . Those men will kill you . I 'm not gonna leave her . Taxidermy . Never really liked that old man . That 's right . Take a good look . 'Cause that 's your future if you keep getting into fights at school . Just hope a night in juvie taught you something . Yeah . The food 's great . Don 't push it , Luke . Not after yesterday . Just tell me why . Why did you have to hit that kid ? What 's that mean ? What the hell 's wrong with you ? A shrug . Is that your answer for everything ? He called you a whore . Get inside . Authorities are still not confirming reports that an aircraft came down last night in rural Arkansas ... Can 't believe I left that on . Call the police . You 're either Mary Campbell or current occupant . We 've been waiting for you . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? Special Agent Simmons says hello . His people trained him very well . He hardly flinched at all when he lost a finger or two . Trouble is , he has information that I need . So you are going to help me loosen his tongue . Sick freak . You 're gonna torture me in front of them ? No . I 'm going to torture them in front of you . Arkansas . Hey , thank you for doing this . Don 't thank me yet . Soldiers . Hey , is that the cheerleader ? Hiro . Hang on . You 're suppose to kill Hiro in the future , right ? Yeah . Well , then he can 't be dead . And if he 's okay , maybe Matt 's okay , too . Yeah . We must be sneaky when we look for them . Yeah . That 's why you 're staying here . Right . What ? Wait . So Hiro 's alive because I kill him . That 's right . I kill him . Yes . He 's alive . Wait . Wait , I got a man down . Man down . Thanks . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna go back . Find Nathan . Disguised as a guard ? Where 'd you see that , an old movie ? I saw you on the plane . I don 't care how many powers you have . One . I don 't know why , but I can only hang onto one at a time . If I pick up a new one , I lose the old one . You 're gonna go up against all of them ? You don 't even know if Nathan 's here . Nathan 's here . He 's probably sweating bullets . Trying not to show it . This whole program was his idea . It means that his ass is on the line . You go back , they 'll kill you . You have a better idea ? Maybe . I know Nathan , too , and not like a brother . I know the way he thinks . That 's ' cause you slept with him . Yeah , and I think the same way . What are you doing here , Dad ? Doing my job . You still haven 't told me how you were on that plane , Claire . I was grabbed by your goon squad . Dad number two tried to send me home , but I don 't walk out on my friends . Or help people sick enough to do something like this . You have no idea how big this mission is and what these people will do once you 're on their radar . Don 't . I 'm not gonna be your excuse any more . You know these guys . Peter . Matt . Hiro Nakamura , of all people . You chained them up like animals . I 've made certain arrangements . Arrangements that would guarantee your safety and the safety of this family . But these abilities have got to be controlled . I have an ability . Does that mean that I have to be controlled ? No , Claire . You 're missing the ... I 'm one of them . So is he . Transportation 's set . Young lady , you 're headed back to Costa Verde . So that 's it . I just dance away to college , pretend everything is all hunky-dory ? Something like that . Yeah . So I get a pass , and everyone I know just disappears . Except for Senator Skyboy , of course , because he 's got everything under control . I 'm walking a fine line here . Balancing the security of this country against a serious threat . Stop . I don 't even know who you are anymore . Either one of you . Stay put for just a minute . We talked about this when I came onboard . And I will take orders , and I will do what has to be done . But you gotta put a leash on your hunter . I haven 't forgotten what we 've discussed . Don 't worry about him . He 's useful until he 's not . Hi . Claire ! Damn it ! I want her found . Don 't forget our arrangement . Keep her out of this . You keep her out of this . Daughter or not , she is running out of favors . I wouldn 't let anything happen to her . What would your hunter do if he knew you were one of them , too ? My mistake ? That I expected my people to act responsibly . Nobody could have anticipated what happened on that hillside . Wait , Matt . We can 't go down there . But this is the place from the drawing . I know it . This is where she was shot . Matt . Ando . How did you get here ? The speedster brought me . We 're looking for you and Hiro . She was here . Hey . Oh , my God . Ando . Hiro . Something brought them together at the crash site . I imagine some of them had the misguided idea that they could still stop this whole thing . Guys , we really gotta get out of here . She 's right . We gotta move . I can 't carry all these people at once . Don 't worry . I 'm just gonna do a quick recon , and find the safest way to ... Daphne ! Daphne ! - Matt ! Danko 's men totally over-reacted . Once they opened fire , they were all out for blood . When they went after Claire , it 's when I knew Danko had lost control . No ! Parkman must have got inside the shooter 's head and forced him to turn on his own men , which became a bloodbath . Agent Simmons seems fatigued . You really need to pay attention . Your father 's in custody , you sick piece of crap . Another lie . Well , it 's time to get started . Where to begin ? Mommy . Why are you doing this ? What did we ever do to you ? Nothing . Wrong place , wrong time . I could have been a flood or tornado . There 's really no difference , actually . How about you , Luke ? Any thoughts ? I sense some dysfunction in the Campbell household . You bastard . You better leave him alone . But I understand . Single mom , troubled teenage son , and judging from that pathetic alimony check I found , I 'd say Dad took off quite sometime ago . What are you doing to her ? Only what you wished you could have done years ago . No . No , stop ... You 're lying . Agent Simmons , Mary is losing her patience . Isn 't it your job to protect her from monsters like me ? He 's not going to talk . Let her go . You say that 'cause you care , kid ? Or is it just a preconditioned response 'cause Mommy drew the short straw ? What do you know about me ? Mom 's a drone , and Dad abandoned you . I know that rage , Luke . And I know that deep down , you 'd like nothing more than to see her blood all over the living room floor . Go to hell . Well , well . It 's a small world . You and I really need to talk . So many good men . Devoted soldiers . All dead . I don 't care who your daddy is . This is your fault . My fault ? You were the ones who started it . You hunted us . I read your file , cheerleader . I know how you heal . Like that Sylar . I 'm nothing like him . One shot to the back of the head . That 's all that takes . I told you to stay away from my daughter . Claire . Get her out of here . I 'll take her home . I 'll take her home . Bennet . He would have done it . He would have pulled the trigger . In a heartbeat . Once they target you , they won 't stop . They 'll go after me , your mom , Lyle . Whatever it takes to bring you down . What are we gonna do ? Right now , nothing . Go home . Live that normal life you always said you wanted . What about Peter ? The others ? I 'll do what I can . Come on . How many more casualties are we gonna take before you get it ? I thought I told you to stand down . You 've been giving a lot of orders today , Senator . Is there something you 'd like to talk to me about ? How did you think this was gonna go ? These people of yours would lie down ? Give up ? Treat us as liberators ? Right now , you 're the President 's golden boy . You pull this off , you can write your own ticket . Downside is , it goes south , you can kiss your political career goodbye . Go back to playing house in your mama 's mansion . We 're all replaceable . Some of us more than others . Excuse me . Petrelli . Nathan , it 's me . One second . You 're calling the shots for now . And I 'll clean up your mess this time . But if your affection for these animals costs me any more men ... Not animals . People . Say it with me . I don 't wanna have to tell you again . Tracy . - I heard . So that 's the kind of killer that you 're working with now ? You need to give yourself up . Now . I can promise you won 't get hurt . Your promises haven 't been worth much lately . You 'll have to do better . This isn 't a negotiation . You don 't have anything I want . I have Peter . Okay . I 'm listening . I want my old life back . I give you Peter , my part in this gets written off as " never happened . " I go back to my apple martinis and overpaid lobbyists . How do you wanna do this ? Mile marker 47 . There 's an old historical site near the road . Three hours . And come alone . If I see even one pair of boots ... No tricks . You can trust me , Tracy . He 's on his way . Show me . Some stuff melts , some burns . Water boils . Kind of like a microwave . That 's very impressive . You should see what happens around pacemakers . You know , I heard you at the door . That kid you hit at school , he didn 't call your mother a whore . You lied . You do that a lot . Why do you care ? Because you 're living half a block down from my father . If that 's a coincidence , God 's improved his sense of humor . You 're wrong . I 'm no one . I 'm not . I don 't have any friends . Shoplift crap I don 't even want . Sell my Ritalin to meth mouths at school . Luke , stop . No , no , no . Don 't worry . He 's lying , at least about the drugs . She hates me , you know . No , I don 't . Well , I don 't even need an ability to know that that 's a lie . She can see it in you , Luke . What you can do . No . She doesn 't know about it . I 'm not talking about the power . I 'm talking about you . This is what scares them . What 's in here . The will . I love my son . I just want him to be happy . Well , he 's not . You lie , Luke , because you 'd rather be anyone else other than yourself . That 's why you got into that fight . That kid could be dead , with your ability . The only reason he 's alive is because of your kindness , and that scares you . I want you to tell me about this power and everything you know about the man who lived down the street . Wait . Stop ! No , stop . Luke , stop ! Stop it ! Luke , stop ! You killed him . He was gonna ... He was gonna save us . What are you ? Hey . Hey . Take me with you . Hello , did you hear me ? Yes . And so what ? So you just killed the one shot I had at finding my old man . He was going to shoot you in the head . I mean , I could have just let him . And I let you live , which is kind of a big deal for me . I could tell you more about your father . Yeah . So could a milk carton . I 'm not that interested . Look , I can 't stay here , with her , with this . I mean , you 're the only one who understands what it 's like . I know where he is . Well , you 're not lying . Which only means you think you can find him . And I know why you 're looking for him . Tell me . Because you 're just like me . You 're trying to figure out why you are the way you are , and in this whole hellish world your dad might be the only answer . You take me with you , I 'll walk you right up his driveway . Does your mother have a car ? Not anymore . What do I do if something goes wrong ? I 'll be right here . But get close to him , okay ? Use your powers . God , what if I kill him ? You 're not going to . Just disable him . We get him , we use him as leverage against the government . Look . He 's not my brother any more , Tracy . And he 's not your boyfriend . You understand ? Yeah . Go . Tracy . Nathan . I came alone . Just like you asked . Where 's Peter ? I 've got him . I told him that you offered us amnesty . He 'll come out when he knows he 's safe . It 's like I told you , you deliver me Peter , I give you your life back . You 'll be surrounded by your friends , you can play house with the Governor , and nobody gets hurt . You must know I 'd assume this was a trap . But I came anyway , Tracy , for you . The offer still stands . You deliver me Peter , you get to go free . You 're serious ? Tracy , I am not the devil you think I am . Someone like you , I can trust . You and I , we think alike . Peter 's ... He 's unpredictable . He 's got in his head he 's gonna save the world . And that is not how it 's gonna end . He 's gonna end up getting all of you killed . All of you . What are you saying to her , Nathan ? What , you 're telling her that I 'm unstable ? Crazed ? You lock me up . You fix everything . You call off your dogs . I got Peter . You take the girl . You said you were alone . I know . How many times are we gonna do this ? As many times as it takes . Do it . Take the shot . - I don 't have it . - Back them off . I can 't do that . Back them off . It 's over , Pete . Give up . Take the shot . No , this is the beginning . Take the damn shot . Take her . Nathan , don 't do this . Get your hands off me ! No ! Nathan ! Look at me . Don 't do this . What the hell was that ? MR. - I told you . I didn 't have it . No ! No ! I saw it . You had Peter cold . Yes , I did . Thank you . You know me . You know I didn 't want any of this . Containment , protecting them from themselves , that was always my goal . Now Peter 's loose , Parkman and the others ... Both sides have tasted blood . The next move is theirs . Thank you . I will send money for gas . Toss your cell phones . This is the last time we get together using these things . If we can find each other , so can they . I figure we have 15 minutes . Understood . You need to see these . Where did you get these ? Matt . He drew them right after the crash . He has Isaac 's gift . I recognize this building . The Divya Velukkai , New Delhi . India ? The warrior must have his sword . I must regain my powers . Help defeat this menace . It is my destiny to go there . It is ? Perhaps it is ours to seek justice . I don 't want it . What they 're doing to us isn 't justice . It 's just stupid . It 's blind fear . If you don 't want to see them punished , what do you want ? I want them to pay for Daphne . Matt , that 's not us . It 's not you . Let 's get one thing straight . Our lives as we knew them are over . We can 't go back to anything that we knew . Then what do we do ? We bring the fight to them . With everything we 've got . Won 't be easy . Credit cards , bank accounts . They 're gone . Homes are gonna be watched . Can 't trust the phones . We gotta find a way to defend ourselves . We leave everything . We do what it takes to survive . Things we can 't even imagine . Remember , they 're gonna come for us , and when that day comes we have to be ready . You 've been awfully quiet since you got back . I 'm just tired . It was a hard trip . I bet . Two days of scouting colleges , all those sorority mixers . Your dad said you begged him to stay another day . So ? Any decisions ? I just ... I was thinking of maybe staying close to home for a while . Getting a part time job . Oh , my God . I would love that . I really missed you . The house would be empty without you . Claire 's home . She 's safe . And we both know Peter . Sooner or later he 's gonna come to you . When he does , can I count on you to do the right thing ? That 's not why you called , Nathan . I can hear it in your voice . You suddenly see how this could all end badly and you 're looking for reassurance . Maybe even absolution . But I 'm not giving it . You pushed me aside and went to the President because you thought your team could handle this . And I suggest you do exactly that . They 're ready for you , sir . Tracy . Nathan . God . Get me out of this . - Can 't do that . Why ? It 's too late . Why are you doing this ? What I 've come to realize is that these powers just lead to chaos . Good people , through no fault of their own , cannot control it . It just leads to disaster . You son of a bitch . Maybe that 's what you tell yourself so you can sleep at night . But this about you . Your ambition . It 's all you are , Nathan . It 's all you ever were . Try not to fight it . It 'll be easier . You 're one of us . You 're one of us , Nathan . Hold her hands . You are one of us , Nathan . You 're one of us .

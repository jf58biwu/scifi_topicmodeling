 ( Tyres screech ) - ( Groans ) What ? - You know what . I do not know what . Take a wild guess . Um ... It ... Is it because I sang the music from the Kia-Ora advert ? I remember that . # It 's too orangey for crows # You think this is funny ? No . I guarantee in about three minutes you will definitely not be laughing . Look , boys , if you think I am gonna stand by and let you beat up my friend , you 've got another thing coming . Oh , we 're gonna beat you up , too . OK . What do you think we should do ? Let ' em have it . Vegetables , a lot of people are scared of them . Take potato , a lot of people would peel it , a lot of people would cube it . I don 't like to , I just like to put it down , bang , two halves . In the pan , potato stew , it 's a bit simple , it 's a bit sexy . - Mike , how sexy am I ? - Ooh , very . - In a salad ... - Daisy . ... in a sausage sandwich , - with a cup of tea ... - Daisy . How sexy am I ? Very . You look good . Really . Good . You look nice . You don 't want to look like you 've made too much of an effort , you know what I mean ? I 'll change my shirt . This , my friend , is gonna be one of the all-time great - chicken stew , d 'you know why ? - No . Because of this . ( Italian accent ) Oregano . Or oregano to you . 'I got it from a wise old herb merchant 'on one of my many travels . ' ( Bell on door rings ) This is the good shit . Woo , mama ! ( Phone ) - Hello . - Hi , is that Daisy ? - Yeah . - ' Hi , it 's Sophie . ' - Oh , hi . - Nice to speak to you finally , - Tim 's told me all about you . - Has he ? What did he say ? Oh , you know , the usual . What sort of thing ? You know , specifically ? Well ... that ... you 're friends , you share a flat , and your name 's Daisy . Oh , right . Is Tim there ? Oh , yes . Yes .

How do you mean , do it ? You 'll find out next week . OK . Bye , Bisley . Bye . I can 't believe she 's sleeping with her boss ! - You what ? - This is how it starts . It 's excuses ! Oh , I 've got to work late . A presentation , I 've got to speak to the New York office , they 're five hours behind . I can 't come round because I 've had ever such a long day . It 's me and Sarah . It 's Milly and Egg . It 's textbook . Ow . What 'd you do that for ? Well , you said to me that every time you suffered emotional paranoia as a result of your break-up with Sarah , I was to slap you round the face . Yes , I did say that . Thank you . ( Sighs ) ( Game beeping ) We could go out . What , you and me ? Yeah . What about your stew ? It 's finished . I 've just got to let it simmer . I don 't know , Daisy . Come on , it 'd be fun . What else are you gonna do ? OK , then . Great . ( Knocking ) - Who is it ? - Brian . Do you wanna come in ? Thought you were going out . ( Tutting ) Twist 's in a mood . Ooh , what a surprise . An unreliable girlfriend . - What 's the matter with her ? - I don 't know . - She didn 't really specify . - That 's right . You 've got to guess . Must be strange being a woman . - All that power . - You what ? They are the true creators , because all men do is destroy things . Yeah . They are the true children of nature . Gaia 's foot soldiers . - They look like us . - Speak for yourself . Two arms , two legs . Two faces . There 's so much more to it than that . If a group of women spend enough time together , their menstrual cycles synchronise . - Men have got that , too . - Mike . No , no . Men have got an unspoken telepathy . A biological connection between male psyches . Whether they know each other or not , put a group together , - always the same . - What d 'you mean ? Shall we show him ? Mike , I really am not ... - Oooooh . - Oh , shit . ( Simulating gunfire ) - Boom . - Phuuuuuu . ( Groans ) Tits . - Bang . - Prrrrrrrrrrrr . ( Chuckles ) Trrrr . Phat phat .

( Groans ) ( Groans ) Trrrrrrrrr . - You ready ? - Yeah . - Manoeuvres tonight ? - Reconnaissance . - Tanks ? - Tim , I 've learnt me lesson . - Oh , yeah ? - I 'm not gonna steal another tank . - Right . - What time are you going ? 2100 hours . - That 's 9 o 'clock . - Right . Would you mind taking Colin for a walk about eight ? Hmm ? - 2000 hours . - Oh , yeah . - Bye . - Bye . ( Laughter on TV ) That 's never happened to me before . - Minicab ? - No , thanks . Look after my stuff . You 're less likely to get searched than I am . - Why ? - You look like a teacher . - That 's enough of that . - Sorry , miss . - What 's the plan ? - Right . 'We get the Tube into Soho 'and go for drinks in a fashionable gay bar , 'before catching a play by a hip playwright , 'preferably with a swearword in the title . 'Then we go to a swinging coffee house and discuss the play 'before retiring to a jazz bar to listen to xylophone music 'and talk about life until it 's time to catch the last Tube . ' - What d 'you think ? - I 'm gonna go home . What do you wanna do ? Right , we get the Tube into Camden and head for the nearest bog-standard indie bar . 'We smoke a fatty boom-batty on the way 'so we 're munted when we order our first drink . 'We stay a few hours , where , if all goes to plan , 'we 'll end up laughing like a couple of twats . 'We relocate to a high-street pub 'with an eclectic jukebox and keep drinking until we 'A : fall over , B : puke or C : fall over and puke . ' I like my idea better . - You would . - It 's more interesting . - Toss a coin ? - OK . Two pints of cider . - And crisps . - Crisps as well . - Two packets . - Two packets . - And nuts . - Nuts . - Honey roast . - I 'm ordering the drinks . I can 't remember what I was gonna say . Fuck it . - Two tequila slammers , please . - Yes ! It 's ups and downs . Like when you 're travelling . More than normal . Not more ups and downs . - Do you know what I mean ? - No . What did you wanna be when you were a kid ? - Monkey . - A Monkee . No , Monkey . - Monkey . - Yeah , Monkey . ( Jabbers ) It was great . - What did you wanna be ? - Elvis . That 's stupid , he 's a bloke . # I don 't wanna be a tiger # Cos tigers play too rough # Go on . Woo . There 's a good little fellow . Right , off to enjoy a night of running round in the dark with a gun . You 've got to stay and be good for Uncle Michael . Settle down , relax and get comfy because you , my friend ... are going nowhere . Oh , bollocks . Colin ! Colin . Colin ! Colin ! Colin . Colin ! Coliiiiiiiin ! ( Sighs ) I 'm glad we decided to stay in , Twist . It 's so nice here . Just you and me together . - ( Door opens ) - Been naughty . - Naughty ? - I 've lost Colin . - How ? - He ran off . - Oh . - Brian , we 've got to find him . - Probably come back . - What if he doesn 't ? I 've learnt one thing from the military , - never leave a man behind . - He 's a dog . - Or a dog . - OK . Bye , Twist . - Sophie seems very nice . - Yeah , she 's cool . Cool , yeah . She 's quite quiet . You 're joking . She talks more than you do . - Really ? - Yeah . And she 's very funny as well . She really makes me laugh . Oh well , I 'm glad for you . Really glad . Glad . - What about you ? - Glad . You got someone special ? No , I think I put men off . - No . - No , I do . Trust me . Hey , come on . Pull my finger ! ( Squeaky fart ) Look , you 're a beautiful , talented woman . I 'm gonna go to the toilet . I bet when I come back some bloke 'll be chatting you up . ( Coughs ) ( Chuckles ) ( Trickling ) You having a good night ? What ? Are you having a good night ? Yeah . You ? Oh , yes . Listen , you don 't know where I could get me hands - on some puff ? - Er , not at the moment . - Have you got any ? - A couple of spliffs ' worth . Can I buy it off you ? No , no . It 's for me and my dog . ( Chuckles ) D 'you remember the Kia-Ora advert with ... # It 's too orangey for crows # - Brilliant . - What are you talking about ? You remember that . No . ( Toilet flushes ) ( Chattering ) ( Husky voice ) Hi , Dom . This is Duane Benzie . ( Echo ) ' This is Duane Benzie . ' Tim , hi . I didn 't expect to see you here . You stole my girlfriend . ( Maniacal laughter ) - Oh , Tim . This is ... - Duane . Tim , hi . This isn 't the kind of place I 'd expect to find you . Funny . It 's exactly the sort of place I 'd expect to see you . What 's that supposed to mean ? - You work it out . - All right , then . You 're Duane . The Duane Duane . Duane Benzie . The Duane Benzie that ... Stole my girlfriend . Well , that depends on which way you look at it . I think Tim looks at it that way . Yes , I do . So , Tim . How have you been ? Haven 't seen you since ... Yeah , well . No hard feelings , eh ? You shot me in the bollocks , Tim . Like I said , no hard feelings . You 're lucky I didn 't sue . - Why didn 't you ? - I 'm not a monster , Tim . Besides , I know you don 't have much in the way of assets . I ... heard you got back together with Sarah . She came to her senses . She not out tonight ? - No , she 's ... - Working late ? - A presentation . - ( Huskily ) Putting in overtime ? - What 's that supposed to mean ? - You work it out . ( Coughs ) Daisy , we 're leaving . Well , nice to meet you , Daisy . Yeah , yeah . Pull my finger . - ( Squeaky fart ) - Daisy . At last I will emerge as the victor . At last I will have revenge . - Minicab ? - No thanks . I 'm glad we got out of there when we did . That could have got a little bit nasty . How about that spliff ? I told you , we 're not selling . - We 're not buying . - You what ? Blondie 's got something for me , - ain 't you ? - No . ( Squeaks ) Yes . Daisy , give ' em the stuff . - They 're only about 12 . - Look at them . ( Cracks neck ) ( Belches ) Woo , mama ! Just what I 've been looking for . - I cannot believe this . - Tim . - I got mugged by the Red Hand Gang . - Come on . And my girlfriend 's sleeping with her boss . She 's not sleeping with her boss . Besides , what if she is ? Sometimes it pays to be single . Look at Marsha . - You know what she told me ? - What ? I was gonna be an Olympic athlete , you know . What 's that got to do with anything ? I 'll tell you . I was a sprinter . A fast one . Why d 'you think I 've got such ace pins ? They 're me souvenirs . Fork-lightning Klein , they called me . I was all set for stardom . Sailed through the districts in ' 67 . Walked the nationals , all set to wow the Olympic Selection Committee when suddenly , bang . - You got shot ? - Might as well have done . I was coming back from training one night , when suddenly this Mini Cooper comes out of nowhere and knocks me off my bike . Next thing I know , I 'm sprawled on the pavement with this pillock in tight trousers standing over me saying , " Oh , sorry love , didn 't see you , I was going too fast . " I was drunk . " He gives me his bottle of Jack Daniel 's . " I don 't drink , " I said . " Oh , go on , love , it 'll help with the pain . " He was not wrong . My God . Fractured me tibia , fell behind on me training , eventually lost interest . What happened to the pillock ? I married him in ' 69 . I often wonder what would have happened if I hadn 't been knocked off my bike . Where would I be now ? ( Well-spoken ) ' Thanks , Des . 'Coming up , the latest from the Five Nations at Twickenham 'and a report from the Davis Cup . Tim . ' Thanks . I 'm being stupid , I know . I 'm paranoid . I 've been hurt . I keep thinking about what happened with Sarah . That is in the history . Yeah ? That 's past . Stop thinking about Sarah . Well , I don 't . I don 't think about her , really . I don 't miss her . I don 't think what it would have been like to get married , move into a nice house in Highgate , have a couple of kids and a surround-sound TV . I don 't think about that . And a studio . - Thanks . - You 're a winner . Sod the grass . You 've got good friends . You 've got a good job and you 've got a foxy lady . I 'm the luckiest man in town . Have a nice night , Tim . Get on that . This isn 't grass . - What ? - It 's oregano . How can you tell ? I 'm a catering student . Get the car . Can you make your way out now , please ? We should do this more often . We could have a blowout for your birthday . That 'd be cool . Hey , here 's a plan . We go home , we watch some telly and we eat some stew . Now that 's a plan I like . - Have you got your keys ? - No . Shit , I 've left mine in the other pub . It 'll be closing in five minutes . ( Tyres screech ) ( Groans ) What ? You know what . He who laughs last , laughs longest . ( Cackles ) ( Tyres screech ) What do you think we should do ? Let ' em have it . ( All ) Ooooh ! ( Simulating gunfire ) ( Machine gun fire ) ( # Samuel Barber : " Adagio for Strings " ) ( As in slow motion ) Noooooo ... Tim , let 's go ! - Minicab ? - Yes , please . Step on it ! Come on ! ( Engines revving ) ( Crash ) ( Sighs ) You bloody idiot . Have you any idea how much this car cost ? Why don 't you piss off back to Romford where you belong ? You little prick . Eh ? Eh ? Clever boys . ( Duane screaming ) ( Duane ) I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! ( Daisy ) Thanks , bye . I can 't believe you said " step on it " . - Why ? - I wanted to say it . ( Holds down buzzer ) ( Releases buzzer ) ( Buzzes again ) D 'you think we 'll have to wait here all night ? No . I 'm cold . Do you know what I was saying earlier on ? About what ? About being single and that . I think the thing is just not to go looking for it , you know ? I think things happen when you least expect ' em to . Yeah ? Yeah . ( Clinking ) - Isn 't that your dog ? - Aren 't those your keys ? Yeah ! I must have had ' em all along . Come on . Have you two been taking Colin out for a midnight stroll ? ( Both ) Yes . - Didn 't you do reconnaissance ? - Um , sort of . Come on , you 're just in time for stew . Come on , chop chop . That was a great stew , Daisy . Think I 'll make another one .

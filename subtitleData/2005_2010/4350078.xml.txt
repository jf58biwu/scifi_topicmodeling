 [ Wedeck ] On October 6th , the planet blacked out for two minutes and 17 seconds . The whole world saw the future . On March 15 , 2010 , you are going to be murdered . - Your briefing , it say who killed me ? - I have to end this call now . - [ Aaron ] My daughter 's alive . - Hi , Dad . She saw something she shouldn 't have , got in trouble with Jericho . The second Jericho knows I 'm alive , they 'll find me and they 'll kill me . NSA finally sent back a new rendering of Suspect Zero . - What 's on his hand ? - [ Janis ] Looks like a ring . This morning , I was thinking about committing suicide . - Oh , my God . - Everything 's changed for me now . - Who 's the woman ? - [ Bryce ] She was in my vision . In my flash forward , I saw this symbol . - It 's a Japanese letter . - What 's it mean ? " Believe . " [ Man ] See there , there and there . - It 's metastasized . To the liver . But no sign of it in the lungs or bones ? No . Look , we hoped this treatment would have stopped the growth . It doesn 't seem to have had an effect . What about hormone therapy ? Bryce , you 're Stage Four . It 's not likely to do much , except make you feel lousy . I ... I feel all right now . [ Man ] That 's not atypical for this type of cancer . I 'm gonna be straight with you , Bryce . We 're running out of options . We could try another round of chemo . I have patients , at this point , who have gotten into clinical trials . How long have I got ? [ Honking ] - [ Honking continues ] - [ Man ] Come on . Hey ! What the hell are you doing ? Didn 't you see me there ? Hello ? - [ Tapping ] - Hello ? Pal , I 'm talking to you . What are you doing ? Hey ! No , no , no ! Come on ! All right ! Come on . What are you , nuts ? You made your point . This is a cherry ' 63 T-Bird ! [ Man shouts ] Yeah , yeah , I wanna report a hit and run . He 's still hitting me ! You made your point ! All right , OK . OK . It 's all right . You are so dead , man . You hear me ? You 're dead ! [ Both speaking Japanese ] [ Speaking Japanese ] [ Olivia ] Dr. Varley , she 's oozing an awful lot . What was her platelet count , hemoglobin and coags , pre-op ? [ Bryce ] I 'm sorry . Her , her platelets were , uh ... [ man ] Platelets , 80,000 . Hemoglobin , ten point five . - Looks like a cirrhotic to me . - [ Olivia ] Is she a drinker , Dr. Varley ? - [ Bryce ] I 'm sorry ... - [ Olivia ] Come on , Bryce . Maneesh , I 'm gonna need some FFP , and two units of packed red blood cells as soon as you can get ' em . She 's oozing everywhere we cut . Send a DIC panel , and hang a banana bag with two grams of mag . Dr. Benford , I 'm sorry . I think you need to think seriously about whether or not you 're committed to this profession . [ # Buttersprites : Cherry Blossom playing ] [ All shout in Japanese ] [ Woman speaking Japanese ] I don 't know where I belong . I 'm not a very good doctor . - I never have been , really . - It wasn 't what you wanted ? I don 't know what I want . I just ... did it . And ... now I 'm here . Have you told your family , your colleagues , about your illness ? My family 's been through enough , Dr. Flemming . With my dad dying of lung cancer for three years ... - It was a nightmare . - [ Flemming ] What about your colleagues ? - Surely they would understand . - [ Bryce ] I don 't want their pity . Pity ? Bryce . You need support right now . That 's what 's gonna get you through this . Nothing 's gonna get me through this . My diagnosis is terminal . [ Flemming ] You don 't know what the future holds . None of us do , really . Yourjob is to take care of yourself , Bryce , to try and have the best life you can , for as long as you can . Live each day doing what feels right . [ Man ] All right ? Here you go . [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Both speaking Japanese ] You 're really here . [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Laughs ] [ Woman on recording ] Pleased to meet you . [ Woman repeats in Japanese ] - [ Bryce repeating Japanese words ] - [ woman ] Please speak more slowly . [ Woman repeats in Japanese ] [ Bryce repeats Japanese words ] [ Woman ] What 's your name ? [ Repeats in Japanese ] [ Repeating Japanese words ] [ Woman ] I love you . [ Repeats in Japanese ] - [ Struggles to repeat ] - [ woman ] Please sit down . [ Woman repeats in Japanese ] - [ Vomiting , gasping ] - [ woman ] How are you feeling today ? - [ repeats in Japanese ] - [ Toilet flushes ] [ Woman ] I hope you are well . [ Repeats in Japanese ] Can you give me the directions ? [ Repeats in Japanese ] I am lost . [ Repeats in Japanese ] Who are you ? [ Repeats in Japanese ] What do you want ? [ Repeats in Japanese ] [ Cell phone ringing ] - Yeah ? - Hey . How 's Tracy ? She 's , uh ... She 's pretty shut down . Terrified Jericho 's gonna come and find her . Well , I 've been looking into that for you . - [ Aaron ] Yeah ? - Yeah . Unfortunately , private military contractors like Jericho and Blackwater are harder to break into than Fort Knox . - That 's what I was afraid of . - [ Mark ] Yeah , but this outfit 's headquartered in Santa Monica , right in our own backyard . Working out of the Burroughs Foundation for International Peace . Some kind of think tank . - Think tank ? - [ Mark ] Yep . It 's gonna take a higher security clearance than I have - to get much beyond that . Hold on . - [ Phone ringing ] Hey , Livy ! Your phone 's ringing . - [ Olivia ] Babe , can you get it ? - [ Mark ] Gotta go . I 'll put out some more feelers , all right ? Yeah . [ Shower running ] - [ Olivia ] Who is it ? - [ Shower turns off ] - Who was it ? - What is this ? It 's this weird text I got . - Who ... Who sent it ? - I have no idea . And you ... figured you ... you wouldn 't mention it ? You already told me about the drinking before I got a chance to bring it up . Since we talked about it , the phone thing didn 't seem like such a big deal . I gotta get dressed . Hey , Bryce . Nice job with that tension pneumo . Thanks . [ clears throat , sniffs ] - You OK ? - Yeah , yeah . - You look sick . - I 'm ... I 'm OK . - Come here . - I 'm ... I 'm all right . You 're not febrile , but you 're really pale . Go home . I 'll have Cynthia cover your shift . - I 'm gonna be OK . I just need a minute . - Bryce . Hey , hey , hey . Come here . - Come sit . You look terrible . - I 'm just ... I 'm just tired . Graphia says you almost passed out during grand rounds last week . - Wanna tell me what 's going on ? - It 's nothing . - Oh , we don 't need to do that . - Come on . Why do you have a central line ? Uh ... It 's for the chemo . Chemo ? I have renal cell carcinoma . Stage Four . How long have you known ? About a year . Had my kidney out just before I started here . This is why you tried to kill yourself that da ... Oh , Bryce . I was terrified . I didn 't think that I could face the prospect of dying . I didn 't want to put my family through that . I can 't believe you have been going through this alone . - I can 't believe I didn 't see it . - It hasn 't been that bad so far . It 's rough for a few days after chemo , but then I bounce back . Anyway , since the blackout , things are different now . I 'm gonna be OK . I 've got something to live for . It 's hot . I forgot the cheese . - I don 't need the cheese . - Well ... It smells great . When I was in the military , this crazy staff sergeant in my detail made the best food I ever threw a lip over . - What ? - I can 't do this . Do what ? Have you drinking here . It 's just a glass of wine . Doesn 't matter . A glass of wine or a fifth of vodka . Just doesn 't work for me . Come on , Dad . Relax . I 'm not asking you to drink . That 's not the point . I can 't be in the same room as it . - You understand ? - After everything I 've been through , you telling me I can 't have a glass of wine ? I 'm 24 years old and I 've been through hell . I can 't have a drink ? Baby , I 'm not talking about what you can or can 't do . I 'm telling you ... what I can 't do . This is good . Fine . I 'll go somewhere else . [ Woman ] The NSA 's digital forensics team uncovered this symbol on Suspect Zero 's ring . - [ Wedeck ] Alpha . - And it could mean anything . The angle of attack in aerodynamics , the brightest star in a constellation . - Alpha 's the beginning of everything . - [ Mark ] If we can enhance the ring , why can 't we see his face ? We tried to rebuild that image from all the various camera angles that we got , but in one his skin was all blown out , in another it was a raking profile , and so on . The ring was much easier . It has hard edges and a reflective surface . We captured still images as the hand moved , we replaced pixels , and then built a 3-D model of it . Frankly , we were hoping the NSA would provide us an analysis of the ring that was a little more substantial . [ Sighs ] To tell you the truth , I 'm uncomfortable talking in this particular group . Uncomfortable ? Look , Ms. Levy , we don 't have time to play games . OK , I 'll be blunt , Mr. Wedeck . One of the members of your Mosaic task force has been red-flagged by the NSA . What ? Who ? A couple of months ago , our wiretapping program intercepted a phone call whose origins had been professionally concealed to a Bureau cell phone . Whose phone ? Agent Noh 's . Since when do you guys wiretap the FBI ? Homeland security is the number one priority . - What do you mean , " Homeland security ? " - Maybe it 's your call , from the woman . - Yeah , about your murder . - [ Mark ] Right . Are you saying that you have a recording of that call ? How do I get it ? I 'm sorry . It 's classified Sigint , signals intelligence . The woman told me I was gonna be murdered on March 15th . I 'm running out of time . So if you have any information on why I 'm gonna be killed ... - I 'm not authorized ... - Come on ! Call whoever you need to call to make it happen ! How about that , Ms. Levy ? Let me make a call . [ Woman speaking Japanese on PA ] [ # Bob Dylan : Shelter From the Storm ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Man speaking Japanese ] [ Man speaking Japanese ] [ Speaking Japanese ] You just said , " Where is the toilet , Los Angeles ? " Let me see that book a sec . [ # El Gato : I Can 't Explain the Things I Do ] It 's so cool . You 're learning a whole language for someone you haven 't met . But I am gonna meet her . I know it . Wow . I 'm hearing myself , and I sound crazy . But it 's a good kind of crazy . Love crazy . You think ? [ Clapping ] - [ Mark ] Hey . - Didn 't see you there . Yeah , I came in late . Yeah ? What 's up ? I 'm really struggling , Aaron . Things were going great at home ... or better , at least . Then this thing happened . Someone sent Olivia a text telling her I was drinking in my flash forward . - Who would do that ? - I don 't know . I only told two people . It 's kind of freaking me out , you know ? - That 's weird . - Yeah . You trying to say something to me , Mark ? Like I said , I only told two people . Do you know how many hours I 've spent listening to your crap ? - Your doubt , your self-pity ? - Thought you were my sponsor . That 's right . But that doesn 't mean I 'm your punching bag . I think I have the right to ask you if you 're communicating with my wife behind my back . You son of a bitch . After all the time we 've known each other , you think I would do that ? - I don 't know what to think anymore . - You don 't know ? You don 't know . Here 's some food for thought . Why don 't you get a new sponsor ? Someone you can really trust . [ Door crashing ] [ # Soul Flower Union : Shelter From the Storm ] [ Woman speaking Japanese ] - Got it . - What ? - Demetri 's phone call . - OK . I 'm taking it down to audio forensics right now . OK . - Can I ask you something ? - What ? Did you send Olivia a text ? Your wife ? Why would I send your wife a text ? Well , someone did . Telling her I was drunk in my flash forward . You 're one of only two people I 've told . - So ? - So , as I recall , you were pretty pissed that I was drinking and the implications that had for our investigation . Oh , I see . You were thinking I was so angry and so petty that I 'd run out and text your wife about it . Get out of my office , Benford . I don 't want to see your face right now . [ Speaking Japanese ] [ Responds in Japanese ] Your accent is really improving , Dr. Varley . [ Speaks Japanese ] Well , if nothing else , I 'll come out of this having learned a second language . So how 's the search for your young woman ? Well , no response to my Mosaic posting yet , but , I did finish my drawing . You want to see it ? She 's quite beautiful . I was thinking about posting it on the Web . Well , at least you know where she likes to eat . What do you mean ? Sushi Arahida . It 's a restaurant in Tsukuba , not that far from Tokyo . I taught at the university there . Is it possible there 's more than one restaurant with this name in Tsukuba ? - Oh , I doubt it . Not with this same logo . It 's a little , tiny place . She 's probably a local . Ms. Kondo , in my flash forward , I was sitting in a Japanese restaurant . - Maybe it 's this Sushi Arahida . - Maybe . [ Bryce ] Thank you ! [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Olivia ] Oh , Bryce ? Dr. Varley . - Do you have a minute ? Hey . - Yeah . Uh , so listen , maybe it 's none of my business , but I made a few calls , did a little bit of research , and there are some good options out there . - I appreciate ... - This friend from medical school is running an experimental trial with Trifectumab out of MD Anderson in Houston . - So I made a call , and you 're in . - Thank you . No . Are you kidding ? It 's the least I can do . - Here . - I 've read about Trifectumab . I 'm not sure about the side effects , though . We 're talking about your life . Now 's not the time to be conservative . Dr. Benford , thank you . Um ... But you don 't understand , uh ... Because of my flash forward , I know that I have something to live for . I can 't take a drug that might kill me or make me sicker . OK , Bryce , you 're only gonna hear me say this once . Maybe the reason you are alive in your flash forward is because you 're gonna take this drug and get better . Bryce , don 't give up on me . Please . Come here . Go to Houston . You need a couple of days , take a couple of days . [ Man speaking Japanese on PA ] [ Man speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaking Japanese ] [ Woman on recording ] There is no delicate way to say this , but on March 15 , 2010 you are going to be murdered . Wow , it 's even worse hearing it a second time . We 've analyzed the ambient noise , and we 've come up with a potential lead . Lead ? What kind of a lead ? - Listen to this . - [ woman ] There is no delicate way ... Now , I stripped away everything but the background noise . [ Recording crackling ] [ Music becomes audible ] - We found ... - You found cheesy electronic music . Oh , no , no . Not just any cheesy electronic music , my friend . It 's the Symphony of Lights , the world 's largest outdoor light and music show . It plays every night in Hong Kong Harbor . Wanna take a little trip ? [ Wedeck ] I 'm sorry , but I just can 't send you to China after that CIA idiot accused them of causing the blackout . Relations between the two countries are tense enough as it is . I want to solve Demetri 's potential murder as much as anyone , but even if she made the call from Hong Kong , there 's nothing to say she 's still there . She concealed the origins of her call , Stan . That makes her a suspect . We have to find out who she is and what else she knows . I promise I 'll have our Legats guy in Asia try and track her down , but I need you here . You 're not going to Hong Kong . End of story . Hey . We 're going . - What ? - Hong Kong . - Wedeck 's gonna be pissed . - Mm-hmm . He 'll get over it . [ TV playing faintly ] [ Woman speaking Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] I 'm sorry . Is this your daughter ? Is this your daughter ? Is this your sister ? They told me at the restaurant she lived here . I came all the way from Los Angeles . Is this Keiko 's ... Do you know ... Keiko ? I 'm such an idiot . I traveled more than 5,000 miles because of a T-shirt ? - [ Bryce on phone ] What was I thinking ? - You were gonna find the woman you love . But I didn 't . Now you know her name . That 's something . [ Bryce ] I don 't even know if it 's her real name . I went to the university , I went back to the restaurant . No one can tell me anything . I don 't know how long I can wait , Nicole . [ Nicole ] Maybe you 're just trying to rush things that can 't be rushed . Sometimes you just gotta be patient . Isn 't that how love works ? I don 't know . Maybe I misinterpreted the whole thing . Maybe it 's it 's just some kind of fantasy . A really good way to run away from my life . Bryce , come home . Come home . [ Knocking ] Hey . Can I come in ? - What do you want ? - To talk . - I was out of line . - Yeah , you were . I 've been a little stressed ... For God 's sakes . You 're the only one dealing with issues ? Of course I don 't . I know you 're dealing with the whole Tracy thing . You have no idea what I 've been dealing with , so why don 't you shut the hell up . Yeah , Tracy 's back . But she 's not the person she used to be . That person is dead . - Aaron . Aaron ... - No , you , you ... You don 't get it . She 's broken , angry , scared . She drinks herself to sleep every night . She 's a messed up alcoholic , Mark . And I 'm to blame . For all of it . She enlisted because she wanted to be just like me . And now she drinks , just like me . There 's not a damn thing I can do about it . Look , we 've crossed a line here , for better or worse . So I don 't think I can be your sponsor anymore , Mark . I 'm sorry . But I could really use a friend . You got it . [ Woman ] Welcome to Los Angeles . Enjoy your stay . Welcome to Los Angeles . [ Crowd cheering ] [ # Bob Dylan : Shelter From the Storm ]

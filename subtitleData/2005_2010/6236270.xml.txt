 Okay , listen up ! Everybody who is able , we are going to search this ship top to bottom . Teams of three . - Weapons ? - Twenty-three , including handguns . - One per group ? - Yeah . Flashlights , radios , only when necessary . Once those batteries are dead , they are dead . Regular check-ins with Dr. Rush in the control room every 10 minutes , and keep in mind , as far as we know , this bucket is really freaking old , and there may be areas of damage where life support is unstable . And , look , be smart , okay ? Don 't touch anything that looks like it might be dangerous . How are we supposed to know what 's dangerous ? - Becker , right ? - Yes , sir . I work in the mess . - I mean , I did . - Well , don 't touch , just look . You 're ... You 're James , right ? - Yes , Lieutenant . - You and Riley are with me . Subtle , man . Subtle . SCOTT : If it 's okay with you , sir , it might be best , considering your obvious skills , for you to hang back here and help keep the rest of these people calm . Don 't patronize me , son . No , sir . - Are you all right ? - I 'm solid , Lieutenant . I 'm trained for this . - Look , I didn 't mean to ... - Look , not now . ON RADIO : Rush , this is Scott . Come in . Rush , this is Scott . Come in . Hello . This is Eli . - Where 's Rush ? - Bathroom , if he found it . I 'm at what looks like a bulkhead door . It won 't open . I was hoping Rush could open it from there . Should I find him ? No . - Here , give me a hand . - What happened to being smart ? This could be the engine room for all we know . We got to at least open a few doors . Do we ? Do we really ? ELI : Hang on . No , keep doing what you 're doing . I think I found where you are . The door is flashing red . SCOTT : Can you open it from there ? Red is usually bad , isn 't it ? Maybe it means the door is stuck . Just try . Okay . You should probably step back . Whoa , whoa , whoa , not good ! Not good . More red ... Close it ! - Close it now ! - I 'm trying ! Yeah . Okay . We established why that hatch was closed . Yeah . A lot of others are closed for the same reason . We 're only occupying a fraction of the ship right now . It just goes on forever . But if there are damaged areas of the ship that aren 't sealed , that could be our problem . Oh , hey , good timing . We just found ... Hey ... Really ? This is Dr. Rush . Meet me in the Gate Room immediately . Everyone . MAN 1 : I don 't know what 's going on . MAN 2 : It 's over there . What 's going on ? In this case are five Ancient communication stones . They work over vast distances in real time . - We can talk to the people on Earth . - Yes . MAN 1 : Great . MAN 2 : All right . RUSH : You physically take control of an individual at the other end . I brought these with us in the event we ended up somewhere out of range of normal communication . So let 's use them . MAN : Yeah . WOMAN : Yeah . I already have . ALL : What ? When ? - Are they sending help ? - No . MAN : Why ? Why are they not sending help ? The only means of dialing this gate from our galaxy was destroyed in the attack . We 're cut off . I want to use one of those stones now . - I have spoken with General O 'Neill ... - I am a United States senator ! I 've explained our situation clearly . In light of my knowledge and experience , he has placed me in charge . He did what ? MAN : How do we know ? I have faith in our ability to repair this ship and to work together , but if we 're to survive this , we need leadership and a clear chain of command . ELI : We only have a few hours of air left . - Yeah . - I want to speak to the General myself . - Senator , please . - Give it to him ! WOMAN : Yeah . SCOTT : Give it to him . - CHLOE : Dad ? Dad ! - Whoa , whoa , whoa . T.J. ? Excuse me , excuse me . Okay . Okay , he 's still breathing . CHLOE : Oh , my God ! JOHANSEN : I saw him taking some pills ? CHLOE : Warfarin , for his heart . Blood thinners are the last thing he needs if he 's bleeding internally . - Please do something ! - Look , I told you , I 'm just a medic . Everyone , please , there 's no need for us all to congregate in the one place . Ms. Johansen , please find adequate accommodation for the injured , - and everyone else ... - No , I don 't recognize your authority , - Dr. Rush . As an IOA representative ... - We have found quarters nearby - much more comfortable . Please go there ... - I think you need to ... and stay there until you 're asked to do something useful . Something useful ? We do not want to settle in ! - We want to get back ! Right ? - Yeah . We should be working on getting home . - WRAY : Exactly . - I 'm not sure if that 's even possible . What ? You haven 't even tried ! Maybe you should actually do something instead of standing around , - talking about being in charge . - If that 's even true . Everybody ! Everyone , calm down ! Now , the fact is Colonel Young put me in charge , and I expect all SG personnel to follow my orders . As for the rest of you , you get out of line , we will lock you down . Now , Dr. Rush is right about a couple things . First off , we all have to work together , and second of all , we don 't all have to stay here , so let 's move out . - Go on , move . It 's okay . - SOLDIER 1 : All right . You heard him . SOLDIER 2 : Do as he says , people . I think we need you , so I 've got your back for now , but if I were you , I would find some way to dial that gate back to Earth . I 've got some testing equipment over here . Looks broken . - We 'll get back to that . - What about all these Ancient crates ? If it 's not ours , don 't touch it . VOLKER : Did no one think of labeling anything ? Every case has a bar code . All right , anyone find a bar code reader ? I guess that got left behind along with the food and water . - Uh-uh . We got food . - Yeah , protein bars and this powdered stuff . Look , everybody . Seeds ? Volker , you 've got to be kidding . PALMER : I got a case of blank paper . VOLKER : Maybe we should start a suggestion box . What are you staring at ? - You were in detention . - Yeah . - For good reason . - GREER : What did you want him to do ? - Leave me there ? - Of course not . I was just wondering what to do about it now . - That 's not up to you . - We 'll see . No , no , no . Don 't do it , man . SCOTT ON RADIO : Greer , I need you to check for any open bulkhead doors that lead to damaged parts of the ship . Rush will direct you . Copy . RUSH ON RADIO : There should be an elevator directly ahead . Copy that . - Are you there yet ? - This is Scott . Radio silence , please . - Hey . - Hey . What 's going on ? We almost lost you . You were thrown clear across the room . - Where are we ? - Sir ... - Where are we ? - We 're on a ship . It 's Ancient . Rush says it 's thousands of years old and we 're pretty far off into the universe . - What 's he doing to get us home ? - He says he 's working on it , but we have bigger problems . The life-support system isn 't working properly . If we can 't get it fixed , there 's not much time . You should also know that he used the communication stones to contact Earth , and he said General O 'Neill put him in charge . I don 't think so . I don 't think ... Oh ... Sir , you shouldn 't be trying to get up just yet , okay ? I don 't think I have a choice , T.J. I can 't feel my legs . - Whoa , jeez ! - ELI : Whoa ! What is that thing ? Come here , I 'll show you . It 's a ... It 's a camera . It 's a flying camera . I 'm calling it a Kino , you know , after the Russian ... - Yeah . - Okay . Well , I figure maybe we can use it to check out the damaged areas of the ship . - That 's good . - Yeah . - That 's good . Where 's it going now ? - Oh , I don 't know . It 's just doing its thing , but there 's lots more of them . - Yeah , it 's cool . - Yeah ! - Do you want one ? - It 's not a gumball machine , Eli . Okay . - Okay ! - Okay , so you figured out where they keep the Kinos . What else have you figured out ? Give me a break , man . This is my second spaceship , and my first was yesterday . I know . Icarus was my first SGC assignment after training . I haven 't been at this much longer than you have . Did they beam you out of your house ? - No . You got me there . - Got any food on you ? - No . - Tylenol ? - Headache ? - Yeah . Me , too . Neuropraxia is temporary paralysis that can follow a concussive injury . You don 't know ? You 'd need an MRI and a qualified doctor who knows how to read it to know for sure if there 's spinal damage . We don 't have either . Hopefully , it 's just the nerves in shock . Best I can do is insist that you remain still . Your tour was over two weeks ago . You should be in some classroom in San Diego . Seattle . That 's where my scholarship was . - I 'm sorry . - That part 's not your fault . Tell Rush I want to see him . Yes , sir . - What 's that ? - Flying camera ball . - I 'm calling it a Kino . - Don 't ask . - That 's marvelous . - It comes with a remote . I thought we could use it to look around . - What do you have ? - Well , it 's not so good , really . These processing nodes are scrubbers , responsible for cleaning CO2 from the air . Here , here , and here , it 's indicating malfunction . Others are failing . Greer , this is Scott . I 'm heading for the Gate Room . Meet me there . Look , I 'm just saying that she better stay out of my face . I 'll remind her of your personal space issues next chance I get . Dr. Rush ? Colonel Young wants to see you right away . There should be a kind of grate covering the node . RUSH : What do you see ? SCOTT : A problem . We see a very big problem . What happened ? You collapsed . We brought you here . - What 's going on ? - I 'm not sure . I 've been here with you . I need to know what 's happening , Chloe . This is important . Dad , I was worried about you . - Okay . - And I 'm scared . One step at a time , honey . One step at a time . - My pills ... - No , Dad , you can 't take any more of those . Your ribs are badly bruised . You will bleed internally . If I don 't take those pills , a bruise is going to be the least of my problems . I know . Don 't worry about me . Go . Find out what 's going on out there . No , I want to be here with you . And I want you here , but right now , I want to know what 's going on just a little bit more . Okay . I 'll be here when you get back . - Okay . - Okay . - What 's going on ? - I don 't know , man . The air filter 's full of crap . Come on . They want us to keep looking . - Let 's go . - All right , okay . Alkaline . Everyone 's heart rates are elevated , people are reporting headaches . - It has to be . - What ? The used-up residue of whatever magic compound the Ancients used to scrub CO2 from the air . So , now we have two big problems relating to the life support . Our first priority must be to seal off any of the leaks . If we can manage that , then we can maybe buy ourselves a day or so before the buildup of CO2 kills us . - As it stands , how much time do we have ? - I don 't know . Couple of hours at most . Huh . Awesome . Brody , there was some medical-grade soda lime in the supply manifest ? - It never made it . - That 's a pity . Well , in a ship this old there 's bound to be systems past their designed life . Okay , let 's say we find the leaks . Can you fix this ? I doubt this stuff can be cooked off . Perhaps if there were stores of this substance in a clean form , or something else capable of CO2 sequestration , calcium carbonate , lithium hydroxide , then yes , " if . " Okay , well , that 's not going to matter because you 're going to get the gate dialed back to Earth before this becomes an issue , - Rush , right ? - Lieutenant ... That 's the kind of thing you 're taught to say in officer training , presumably for the benefit of those who don 't know any better . Please . What makes you think I won 't try ? Greer , I found what looks like a shuttle . Looks like there are two shuttles , attached to individual docking sleeves . - We 're all going to die . - GREER : Shut up , Franklin . I 'm just saying what everyone 's got to be thinking . I said shut up , or else you 're going to be the first . This the door ? Yeah , yeah , that 's it . Can you close it ? It won 't close . We can 't close it from here , either . There 's something wrong with the mechanism . FRANKLIN : I think I found the leak . There 's another door on the back of the shuttle , but there 's no control . Then maybe we can close it off locally . FRANKLIN : The shield keeping the air inside is obviously not 100 % effective . RUSH : Probably wasn 't designed to compensate for the amount of damage the ship has sustained . FRANKLIN : Is there a way of boosting it ? At least in the areas we need it ? RUSH : We haven 't found a way yet . It seems to be operating at maximum capability . ELI : Open the door ! Well , that 's not good . That 's very good , sir . A very good sign . I don 't have time for this , do I ? Two problems . We 're venting atmosphere from a damaged shuttle , and even if we could seal it off , the life-support system in this ship is past its expiration date . We 'll build up CO2 to lethal levels within a day . Well , that explains the headache . You already had one . They 'll find a way . That 's what these people do . Well , most of these people aren 't even supposed to be here . - How did the ship get damaged ? - We don 't know . It certainly looks like it 's been through a battle , at least the parts we can access . We 're still cut off from most of the ship . It 's huge . They tried jamming something into the shuttle doorway to keep it open long enough to let the person inside get out ... But it just opens again . Some sort of safety mechanism , like an elevator . Rush says he can 't override it . How long do we have right now ? As it stands ... Rush says if we don 't get it closed , we 've got ... just over an hour . Bad air 's better than no air . Guess a day 's better than an hour . Someone 's got to go in there and close this door . My head is pounding . Heartbeat has accelerated . It 's getting harder and harder to breathe , as our very lives are being vented out into space . That is going to get old very fast . - This needs to be documented . - No one 's going to see that . How do you know ? We made it here . Someone else could , too . If we die , maybe this can help them to find out what happened to us . Yeah , well , we 're not dead yet . I 'm starting to have slightly blurred ... - Eli ! - What ? So how are we going to decide who ? RUSH : I assume we 're not going to get any volunteers . What 's another day going to buy us ? Time , to find a way to survive . May I see the list ? JOHANSEN : I marked the names of anyone injured . Right . We have to find out people 's skills , background , experience ... Doesn 't take any special skills to die from asphyxiation ! Look . What I 'm saying is , it shouldn 't be someone with potentially valuable knowledge or abilities we might need to help us survive beyond this . Are you really suggesting - what I think ... - Half the people on this ship - already want to kill you . - I don 't care . You can 't ask someone to sacrifice themselves , period . Politicians ask military personnel to sacrifice themselves for the good of others all the time . If someone doesn 't go in there and close that door , we 're all going to die , period . Franklin is still working at the airlock controls locally , but it doesn 't look good , sir . Camile 's explaining the situation to everyone onboard . - I 'll do it . - Sir ? This isn 't the kind of thing I can ask somebody else to volunteer for . If we 're going to make it past this , we 're going to need you , sir . I don 't know about that . You 're doing a pretty good job without me , Lieutenant . Yeah ? Well , look at the mess we 're in . - If that 's not proof that we need you , then ... - Look , I 'm not sure anyone should do it . I don 't want someone sacrificing themselves for me . I say we figure this out together while we still have time , - or we all die trying . - I want you to both listen to me . It needs to be done , and I 'm doing it . - Look , sir , you can barely stand . - Help me . Look , the paralysis is temporary . - Help me . - You know that now . You will recover . - Lieutenant , I need your help . - No , sir . - I gave you an order . - I know . You can have me court-martialed when we get home , but I am not going to help you kill yourself . My father 's not in his room . We 'll find him . He does not leave this room . - SCOTT : He can 't have gotten far . - I told him what was going on . Greer , this is Scott , come in . Greer ? Greer , do you read ? Senator Armstrong is missing . He may be headed your way . He 's here . He 's got a gun . I don 't want to shoot you . I don 't think you want to shoot me . - Get out of the way . - FRANKLIN : Just give me a little more time . - Let me try and fix this . - I don 't have much . ELI : Guys , I 'm not seeing any change . Whatever you just tried , and it 's not working ! The problem 's obviously mechanical . You can 't fix it . Tell me what to do . Dad ! No , wait ! Dad , no ! No ! No ! No ! Open the door ! - Open the door , please ! - I can 't ! Please open the door ! - He was dead on his feet . - Dad , no ! I love you . Please open the door . No ! Eli ! Not him ! There 's nothing I can do for him here . Help him ! Open the door , please ! Please ! No . No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! He can 't leave me . Chloe . Chloe ! Well , at least he bought us a day . You ! You did this ! You killed him ! You 've killed all of us ! - Chloe , stop ! Little help here . - Hey , hey , relax . - Hey , hey , Chloe . - Just get away from me ! All of you ! Miss Armstrong . You 're in shock . Believe me , I understand . Everyone deals with tragedy in different ways . - You 're looking for someone to blame . - I 'm not looking . Hey , hey . I 'm sorry about your father . I truly am . He was a good man , and he certainly wouldn 't have been my choice , but you must realize , none of this was my fault . I didn 't create the situation that forced us here . There was no other way . Miss Armstrong , I know you don 't want to hear this just now , but this ship ... This ship could be the most important discovery mankind has made since the stargate itself . You know , the Icarus Project was something your father truly believed in . Enough to risk his career to support . What difference does it make if we all die ? A number of people died during the attack on the base . Some of them I knew very well . I 'm sure some had more value than others . As human beings , all of them were invaluable . Look , my point is , I promise you , I will do everything I can to make sure no one gave their life in vain . No one . Please give me a chance . Colonel . - We 've lost Senator Armstrong . - Oh , my God . - He 's bought us some time . - To do what ? We 're working on it . First up is trying to dial the gate back home . - Should you even be on your feet ? - No . Well , I am on my feet , and right now we 're trying to get home . Camile , I need your help . You know these people . I need you to spread the word . Try to keep things as positive as you can . - I can do that . - Good . CHLOE : I can 't believe my dad is gone . I watched him die , and I still just can 't accept it . - Tell me about him . - Why ? Man died so I could live . I 'd like to know a little more about him . No matter how tired he was , or how long he 'd worked , or what was going on in his life , he always had time to listen to me . I 'd go on and on . He never preached . He never told me what to do , even though sometimes I wished he would . He would just listen . And then he would tell me that he loved me . The best part was if I 'd had a fight with my mom , he never took sides . Hmm . Oh , God . My mom . He was her whole life . She probably thinks we 're both dead . All I know is that he wanted you to go on . I know . I got to get back to the search . You going to be okay ? I don 't know . Fair enough . - Rush : Eli ? - What ? What are you doing ? I just watched a man die . Okay ? Don 't you even care ? Of course I do , and I 'm also trying to learn as much as I can , as quickly as I can . That is , in addition to running nine separate searches in the database in the hope of solving our life-support issues . Right . Found anything ? Destiny . As in ours ? The name of the ship . Translated from Ancient . I 've also discovered that they were never here . I thought this was an Ancient ship . It is , but they sent it out unmanned , planning to use the gate to get here when it was far enough out into the universe , but they probably learned to Ascend before that time . Learned to what ? Ascension . It 's a process whereby consciousness converts to energy that no longer requires physical form . That wasn 't in the video . Well , there 's more than one video . We should get back to work . Sorry . Sir , I think I got it . It wasn 't even that hard to find . It 's right here in the dialing program . - You 're sure ? - Yes , it 's an eight-symbol address . You mean you can dial this thing back to Earth ? There 's no point of origin indicated , but still , there 's only 36 symbols on this gate . I 'm assuming the ninth symbol represents some X-factor distance equation . Well , I don 't care . Start dialing . Sir , don 't we want to bring Dr. Rush in on this ? YOUNG : Well , you said this wasn 't that hard to find ? - No . - Well , then he probably already knows and didn 't tell us . - Oh , no , no , no , no . - What ? Someone 's dialing the gate . - Colonel Young . You 're up . - Nice to see you , too , Rush . I did order you to report to me . Yes , but what are you doing ? We 're trying to dial Earth . RUSH : That would be a mistake . YOUNG : Riley thinks he 's found the address for home . RUSH : His understanding of Ancient is marginal at best . RILEY : With respect , Doctor , I know enough to recognize a reference to Earth . He says the address wasn 't that hard to find , Rush . No , no . This is a complete waste of power we may need . We have the address back . All we need is the right point of origin . And we 've got 36 tries . We barely have enough power to operate the main systems . This ship simply doesn 't have the capability to dial Earth . You see , that 's news to me . - He didn 't tell me that , either . - Well , I 've only just learned myself , - and you know what I 've been doing . - Even if it doesn 't work , the people aboard this ship need to see us at least try . So , what , you 're going to drain what little power we have for the sake of morale ? How ridiculous . What was that ? YOUNG : Anyone near the observation deck ? Colonel , it looks like we 've dropped out of FTL . - RILEY : Because we were draining power ? - No , no . If I 'm right , the gate should begin to dial any moment . How did you know that ? The ship detected a stargate on a planet within range that may have what we need . What ? How the hell are there even stargates out here ? The Ancients sent out a number of unmanned ships ahead of this one . They 're programed to gather data , resources , to manufacture stargates and deposit them in habitable worlds . Any relevant information is relayed back here to help plot the course . You 're telling me that this ship knows we 're in trouble ? Yes , because I told it we were . Essentially , we 're flying on autopilot . This ship may have stopped when it was within range of a stargate regardless of our need . But I have reason to believe ... YOUNG : So , what we need is on the other side of that wormhole ? An educated guess , yes . There 's only one way to find out . RILEY : Sir , you can 't do that . We have no idea what 's on the other side . We can use the Kino to find out . I expect that 's the purpose of this device . - I 'm getting readings over here . - What have we got ? Temperature , gravity , atmosphere composition , barometric pressure . Oxygen , nitrogen , very little CO2 , extremely low humidity . - Habitable , but just barely . - Good enough . BRODY : Looks like four other addresses came up here , too . They could be other planets within range . Maybe we should think about dialing them up and seeing ... No , no , no , they 're locked out . The ship chose this one . The stargate is open , all we have to do is step through . What we have to do is put a team together . Dr. Rush . RUSH : Looks like our time might be limited . YOUNG : What is it ? It 's a countdown . Just over 12 hours left . What happens then ? I suspect we jump back into FTL . Palmer is a geologist . Obviously she should go . Franklin and Brody are the best of the rest of what we have . Thanks for the ringing endorsement . He didn 't even mention me . YOUNG : Franklin goes . The others stay . We 're still going to need good people working on the problem from this end . ELI : I 'd like to go . Really ? If I can help , then ... - Colonel Young , please . - What ? You don 't think I can handle it ? He 's going . I 've been off-world before . You have made a habit out of pulling our asses out of the fire . Eli , you want to go , you 're going . The only one I 'm questioning right now is you , Dr. Rush . Well , besides Palmer , I 'm the only one who knows what we 're looking for . We have 12 hours to find what we need and then get back on the ship . You 're sure you can 't stop it ? No , we 're just along for the ride for now . Then we may all be better off on the planet . Well , that 's another reason why I should go . Someone to assess whether long-term survival there is even an option . Right . Okay . I want everyone clear that Scott is in charge of this mission . Let 's gear up , let 's find whatever supplies we have , and move out . - Sir , about Eli ... - He volunteered . He 's not trained for this . Just like a lot of people we got on the ship . I 'm going to need to know what they 're made of . He 'll slow us down . Well , if he does , you send him back to the gate . Listen , if we 're going to make it , and I 'm not just talking the next few hours , we 're going to need everyone on board to step up . Lieutenant . Keep an eye on Rush . We 'll be back , sir . Good luck .

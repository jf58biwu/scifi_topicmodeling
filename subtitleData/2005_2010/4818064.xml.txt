Jan Harris . Call me Germana ! Germana ! Germana ? Yes ! This industry has rubbed off on me wonderfully . Maybe next time I could treat you to some stee-tayay shi-suay for ee-fray !

But you gotta hand it to her . Still ! You have to exploit the press for all they 're worth ! you know ? Plus you could go to the moon . The moon ? then ? ... That 's why . Rouge ! Easy as pie ! Who 'd have thought just leaking a few photos on the Net would get the tabloids all over it so fast ? It was the fans more than the tabloids ... I feel a little sorry for him . We didn 't have a choice . after all . let 's go . Dunk Mask ! Touch Rouge and you die ! Don 't go thinking you 're hot stuff ! Is this entire crowd her fans ? Just like a road game . Sounds like fun . Makes a good handicap . then I too ... Da-dum ! it 's a chance to get to the moon ! everyone ! We predict our victory ! Root for us ! Hang in there ! Kick those idols ' asses ! Tonight 's game has a time limit : the time it takes to sing " Running On . The side with the most points when the song ends is the winner . The beautiful curve of that Achilles tendon ... just as if it 's thrumming a melody ! Viva Cosmoon ! That Germana is no ouch-slay himself . Huh ? The full version of " Running On " is 5 : 18 .

Gotcha ! Sela ! Okay ! Good one ! Rouge ! all right ! This is what I 'm talking about ! Sweet ! Dan ! Basquash ! Oh ! This is getting fun ! Let 's show them what we can do too ! Idol play ! Dammit ! Thanks ! Shit ! That idiot Dan ! He 's not taking them seriously just because they 're idols ! he 's serious . and he still can 't get the ball away from them . Shit ! It 's not supposed to go like this ! Those idols are pretty good ! Dan ! Don 't be tricked by their dance . There ! Destroy ! So cool ... Good ! Keep that up ! You still have time ! Alan ? This song is ... this is the live version ! There 's only 1 : 46 left ! Huh ? What ? don 't look away ! Destroy ! Miss Rouge ! Rouge ! Rouge ! Hold on — Dumbass ! you okay ? Shut your pie holes ! Hold on ! Okay ? ! Ow ! I can 't sing any more ! it hurts ! what are you ... I 'll carry you to the bench . You don 't need to — Quit squirming . You can 't eat a Destroy and be just fine . Don 't underestimate me ! I dodged the core of it . Everybody 's looking at us . It 's because of those photos that were spread around . No reason to let it bother you now . That kiss was setting a trap for all of you ... I 'm your enemy . Why are you being nice to me ? are you okay ? Don 't try to push yourself . we have no choice . I declare this game finished — What ? ! I explained the rules . The game is over when the song ends . Play on ! you still have two left ! I can 't sing Rouge 's part . I can ... I can 't let you continue in your unstable condition . Be serious ! Just give up already ! A loss is a loss ! Lose with some class ! Go home ! Go home ! Go home ! Go home ! This is probably part of their strategy too . We gotta lose because of this ... ? Then the game goes to ... What links my heart to your heart is ... What 's that ? That 's ... Alan ! Why is he ... ? 500 ) } Far more than some vague friendship ... Take a look at this ! That 's ... a fan club membership card ? And it 's Member Number 7 ? ! Single-digit members are Premier-level ! I 'm a huge Eclipse fan ! Listen up ! The rules didn 't say whether Eclipse themselves had to be singing ! let 's sing the rest of the song together ! What should we do ? Do ? Well ... Eclipse is winning ... Right ? goes ! Rouge ? everyone ! I think I can keep going ! So I want to play this game out to the end ! I 'm not quite in full form so I don 't know if I can manage the whole song ... Please ! Sing it with us ! And we 'll win for sure ! Shall we ? Why not ? you all wanna sing ? Running On " ! { \ 3cHBF5860 } Someday I 'll tell you of the greatest legend ... You won 't beat us ! Here 's a token to remember me by ! Excuse me . I knew he was cool ! Destroy ! All right ! Good !

I thought we would win for sure . But today 's game was so much fun ! It was ! It might be due to him . Him ? we 're gonna beat you so bad . Dunk Mask . And so ? don 't tell me he 'll be on your mind ? Th-That punk ? No way ! you ... ! I don 't care about him ! Really ? I carry an autographed photo as a good luck charm ! Alan might actually be pretty weird . so we have to be grateful . A tie ... is the same as losing ! Dan . don 't tell me Dan fell asleep ? Must be from all the thinking he did . you know . Called ? Yes ... As if they were about to start telling me something . There was something else underneath today 's game . Why her ... ? but we 're gonna keep going !

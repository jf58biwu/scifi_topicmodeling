 And the bear came across a fox . And the fox said , " Bear , bear , stop right there . " There 's a monster up ahead . " Okay , bedtime . No , no , this is the last book . Oh , I thought that the last book was the last book . We are almost done . You guys work well together , and I don 't like it . Hello . Hey , it 's Peter . Hi . What 's wrong ? " What 's wrong ? " Is there something wrong ? No . Why , what 's wrong with you ? Uh , nothing . I assumed there was an emergency . Nope . No emergency . What 's up ? Nothing , I was actually calling for Rachel . Is she there ? Yeah . Actually , it 's kinda stupid . I can call back later if you guys are in the middle of something . No , no , she 's-she 's right here . Uh , Rach , it 's for you . It 's Peter . Oh . Hey . Yeah , did you remember it or not ? Are you serious ? Oh , what is it ? Aunt Liv , can we keep on going ? No , I - Yeah . I don 't know that one . All right , hold on . Hold on a second . Hold on . Uh , " But I don 't see any monster , " the bear said . " And he kept walking . " Because he didn 't believe there was a monster up ahead . " Aunt Liv ? Yeah ? Monsters aren 't real , right ? No , sweetheart . They 're not . The cameras are dark . Let 's go . We gotta move . I told you , relax . The alarm 's disabled . There might be a backup system . No , there isn 't . I checked all the security . Why don 't you finish up in here ? I want to see what 's behind this door . Come on , Jonathan . We 've gotta get outta here . Hold on a second . Stop right there ! You should be arrested for what you do . We let them go . All of them . These animals deserve better . How would you like to be caged up and tortured ? Shame on you for what you do . These are living creatures and you murder them . You 're a killer . Tell me you didn 't open that door now . Yeah , you bet I did . Get out . Now ! All of you get out ! You should be arrested . Experimenting on animals is a crime . Somebody shut her up ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Come on . Get out ! Go ! Let 's go . Come on ! Jonathan ! Let 's go . Come on , go ! What the hell was that ? That thing , that thing grabbed that guy . - I 'm freaking out , man . - We got to get out of here . What do we do ? Do we call the police ? We can 't leave Jonathan . We have to go back . No , no , no . Dude , this is crazy . This is crazy . What is that ? I don 't know ! I can 't see ! Chris ? What did that ? Transcript : Yyets. net Final Edits By : VeRdiKT Unleashed . One cream , one sugar . Thank you , Peter . Peter , no ! Walter , we talked about sharing . That 's not to eat . You 've ruined it . It 's an omelet . It 's not an omelet ! Oh , my - Ugh ! Walter , why is there an ear in the omelet ? It was an experiment . It was a protein-rich incubator . It was growing . It was growing ? That 's perfect . No , it 's not perfect . You just ruined it . And you could have died , had you eaten it . - Hello ? - Really ? - Okay . - You know , maybe in the future you could do me a favor and just put up a sign warning me not to confuse your toxic playthings with breakfast . Maybe you should get your own breakfast and not poach mine . Dad , that is hardly the point . Remember yesterday , when I nearly washed my face in a sink full of acid ? Or three days ago , you hooked Gene up to the solar panels and I nearly electrocuted myself . This is a lab . You 're the one who should be careful . I trust you look both ways when you cross the street . Yeah , but the difference being that if I don 't , I 'm the only one who gets flattened . You , Walter , you live in a society with other people . Hey ! - What ? ! - What ? ! That was Olivia . Local P.D. found the vehicle a couple hours ago . Three bodies inside : two male , one female . And the cause of death ? They appear to have been attacked by an animal , but the coroner 's never seen anything like it . Whatever did this doesn 't appear to be indigenous to the area . Well , wherever it is indigenous to , I don 't wanna live there . Oh , interesting . Some would say disgusting . Whatever did this had enormous claws , like those of a bear or one of the big cats . The spread of the digits , V - shaped . It 's too wide for one of those creatures . Configuration closer to that of an eagle . Of course much , much larger . Hey . We 're looking for big bird . Don 't be ridiculous . Perhaps a pterodactyl . Have evidence techs bag their IDs ? Um , no . I don 't think they were carrying any . Maybe this is why . That 's a Brockhage lock pick gun . They work great . A little bulky for my taste , but - Looks like these kids were out for more than a joyride . Mmm , this is quite delicious . Where did you get that ? In the car , uneaten . What is the matter with you ? Oh , forgive my son . He 's been in a mood all day . I just figured , " Don 't eat the evidence , " went without saying . It has no bearing on the case . I assure you . Four drinks . Three bodies . There were four people in this group . We 're missing a body . Have we searched the woods ? We had canine units canvas the area . We didn 't turn up any other bodies . Well , maybe one of them got away and survived . If they did , they could answer a lot of questions . I 'm gonna go check local hospitals ... See if the emergency room has anything that lines up with an animal attack . All this stuff is from Junkie Genie 's . It 's a fast food joint up by M.I.T. Food is crap . But it 's cheap , and it 's open late . So it 's always filled with undergrads . I thought you falsified your degree from M.I.T. Yeah , Peter ... Why commit to anything when you can just fake it ? I spent some nights there . Maybe we should go through the student database and see if we can I.D. any of the victims . - Hey . - Hi . I understand Chris Hawkins lives here . Olivia Dunham , FBI . Yeah , um , Chris isn 't here . I know ... But would you mind if I asked you a few questions ? I 'm Carl . And no , I would love it . Come on in . Thank you . Oh , yeah , uh , that isn 't mine . That was left here by a stranger . Can I get you something ? Orange juice ? Candy ? How ' bout some pants ? Yeah , I can do that . So how well do you know Chris ? Oh , you know , okay . Kinda , " Hey , how 's it going ? " " Nice , whatever . " " What 's for dinner ? " That kinda stuff . Why , is he in some kind of trouble ? I 'm not at liberty to say . Oh , no , no , no . It 's just because he doesn 't seem like the type , you know , to get into FBI kinda trouble . Why do you say that ? He 's always making flyers , going to rallies . You know , political . So what kinda causes ? It 's really just the one . Uh , Animals Forever , I think it 's called . Or no , no , no . Animals First . He was an animal rights activist ? Yeah , definitely . He 'd save anything with a beak or a claw . Jeez . Whatever got to him had some pretty nasty claws . And some very large fangs . What is that ? Punctures from the fangs of most likely some type of viper . So this thing had the claws of a lion and the fangs of a snake ? It reminds me of a woman I once knew in Cleveland . Walter , these punctures are over four inches apart . And that would make this snake eight-feet long . Her name was Harriet something . How is everything ? Well , apparently you 're looking for a lion-snake named Harriet . Did you find anything at M.I.T. ? Yeah , the victims were all animal rights activists , a group called Animals First . So you think that they were breaking into labs that were doing animal testing ? And releasing the animals , which would explain the burglary tools and the lack of I.D. It would , but it wouldn 't explain how whatever it is that these guys released was able to rip a door off their car and kill ' em all . Walter , have you got any idea what kind of animal would be in a lab that could do this ? Well , judging by the wounds , I 'd say two or three different ones , actually . Right , a motley crew of lab animals got together and decided to exact their revenge on mankind . Astrid , let 's look up labs in the area that do research with animals and - See if any of them reported break-ins . Yep , I 'm on it . Thank you . Oh , no . This is Unit 81 . We 're responding to the monster sighting on Route 30 . Roger that , 81 . It 's always a monster . Monster must be housewife for raccoon . You hear that ? Any leads on the fourth victim ? No . What ? Nothing . You called Rachel last night . - Anything important ? - Hardly . You know that song " If you like pina coladas " ? We were trying to remember the name . It turns out ; it 's called Escape . So you two are friends now ? Does that bother you ? No . Hey , Charlie , what 's up ? Oh , good heavens . Astrid , Charlie just called . Animal Control got a call from a woman in Newton who claims that she nearly hit a monster on Route 30 . So I 'm gonna meet him there . Will you call me if you find anything ? - Yeah , sure thing . - Thanks . Olivia . Be careful . Thank you , Walter . What was that all about ? Nothing . Just want her to be safe . Hello ? This is Francis . I need Medevac teams and backup sent to my location . Charlie ? Charlie ? Charlie . How bad is it ? I don 't know . Uh ... I 'm all right . What was it ? Big . What the heck is that ? Put the stinger in here , please . Now , please , in here . Excellent . Thank you . Thank you very much . Agent , I 'd like you to get that eyed down at the hospital . No , thanks . It won 't be necessary . Agent Francis , I - I 'm told you were attacked by the beast . - What did it feel like ? - It hurt . No , I mean the animal 's dermis . Was it rough , uh , like a rhinoceros ? I haven 't felt any rhinos lately . But , uh , it was course like sandpaper . And the metasoma , the tail , was it segmented like a scorpion ? I didn 't get a good look at it . It kept on knocking me on my ass . Perhaps you did , you just can 't remember . Trauma can do that . I could hypnotize you - Walter , I think that that 's enough for the moment . But it would be very helpful to identify the traits . Are you okay ? Did you take something ? Psychedelics ? No , not since Thursday , no . Walter , why don 't you share on what you 're thinking ? I believe we may be dealing with a transgenic species . Which is what ? It 's an animal creation . Um , an organism made up of the genes of multiple species . The best of the best , as it were . You 're saying that you think the creature is man-made . Accelerated Darwinism . Is that even possible ? I - In theory , yes . Although one would have to solve many problems : Incompatible species , massive mutual rejection . Similar to when a transplant recipient rejects a donor organ . And there 's a reason for that . Mixing a bunch of species to create a franken-rhino is unnatural . And a really bad idea . - Dunham . - Hey , it 's me . Is Charlie all right ? Yeah , he 's okay . Thank God . Okay , um , you wanted me to look into any labs that might house animals near the first crime scene . And ? How can I help you , Agent Dunham ? Dr. Swift ? You could start by telling me what sort of work you do here at Swift Research . Well , we 're commissioned by pharmaceutal and cosmetic companies to test their products . Uh , to make sure they 're safe before using them in human trials . Oh , by testing them on animals first ? It 's an unfortunate , but necessary step . You know , it 's better to have an animal experience an allergic reaction to a certain perfume , so that you don 't have to . Uh , Dr. Swift , are you aware that a group of college students were attacked and killed near this facility last night ? Attacked ? By whom ? That 's what we 're trying to determine . We believe these students may have been - Are you okay ? Um , no , actually . We 're three days behind on a deadline . Uh , you 'll excuse me if I seem insensitive , but what does this have to do with me and this lab ? We believe they were animal rights activists . That they were killed after they broke in and released animals from a facility much like you have here . So you 're suggesting that a lab animal is responsible ? Well , maybe one that was genetically altered ? Do you do any of that sort of work here ? No , Agent Dunham . I told you we only test products . And what 's more , there was no break-in . Doing some cleanup work ? Oh , hundreds of animals in and out of here every week . As I 'm sure you can probably imagine , the cleanup never ends . Mind if I take a look ? Uh , not to be a rude host , but you actually do need a warrant . Understand , we deal with billion-dollar trade secrets , and I am obligated to respect my clients ' confidentiality . No , hmm ? H - How would we accomplish that ? Wait , damn it ! How can I concentrate with you running around ? Walter , are you talking to me ? No , just thinking out loud . - Hey . - Hey . Walter . Walter , I need you to tell me what exactly you would need to create a genetic hybrid . Like , specific items , so that I can see if Robert Swift 's bought any of it . I would need some sodium bicarbonate ... and a house in the country . A place to be alone with my thoughts . Some mahler for the late nights . And time . A lot of time . I know , it 's like he 's on another planet . You 've seen him . He 's been like that all day . But can you focus him ? Focusing Walter is even at the best of times just a matter of degrees . - Okay , fine . - Thank you . Hey , Walter , I need you to step back to the Planet Earth for a second and focus on something that isn 't about you . Peter ... I 'm afraid this is about me . About my work . I found this book among my old files . What is this , Walter ? Olivia . Is this the creature ? No . But I fear it is quite similar . Where did you get this ? I tried to make it , 20 years ago . Are you saying that you created this ? Not this one specifically . My experiments were a failure . You knew . You knew all along . You knew that this was connected to your work , and you knew you had information that could help us but you kept it to yourself . My creatures didn 't survive . Someone else must have finished my work . Who , Walter ? Who could have done this ? Twenty years ago , who were you working with ? Kelvin Genetics . We were doing classified work for the U.S. Army . - I need a name , Walter . - Uh , guys . Do you remember anybody specific ? - No . - Guys . This body is moving . What ? They 're still alive . Quick , unzip it . They may be suffocating . - Uh , maggots ! - No , not maggots . Larvae from the creature . You mean that these are baby monsters ? Yes . We must collect them . Peter , a Petri dish . Make it a bucket . I 'm gonna be sick . Two buckets . Walter , how is this even possible ? The stinger . It must carry the eggs . It transfers them ... to a suitable incubator . What , you mean it plants the eggs when it stings you ? Yeah . It 's fascinating . Oh , God . Charlie . So far there have been three reported sightings in the Greater Boston area - Two in Medford and one in Arlington . Authorities advise if you see it or any other wild animal , do not try to confront it yourself . Do you hear this ? There 's some kind of mountain lion on the loose . Mountain lion ? Yeah , in Boston . Where does a mountain lion come from in Boston ? Maybe it escaped from the zoo . Well , I doubt that , otherwise they would just say so . The mountain lion , also known as a cougar or a puma , is found in most - Well , baby , that 's why you married me . - The possible - - Why ? So I can protect you ... From all the scary things that are out there . And , uh , who 's gonna protect you ? I told you , it 's just a scrape . Bad guy ... Broken bottle . Ohh . Nothing I haven 't handled before a dozen times . Who 's that ? - Liv . - Charlie , hey . What 's up ? - Uh ... - You okay ? Yeah , Charlie , um - But you may not be . Electro-conductive gel for the ultrasound . Enough with the suspense . What is it exactly that we 're looking for ? I believe the stinger we found in you may have carried the creature 's embryos . I think this is why the creature didn 't eat you . I think you may be carrying its offspring . You trying to tell me that I 'm pregnant ? We 're hoping not . - So ? - Ten times magnification . Is that - I 'm afraid so . One small piece of good fortune . At least , the creature doesn 't mate in the traditional way . Thanks for that , Walter . That 's great bedside manner . So what do we do now ? I don 't know . I can 't simply remove them . They 've already spread throughout his system . Just give me a second . Astrid . Walter . Walter , calm down . Liv , uh , the other victim . How were these things actually born ? It doesn 't matter ... Because , um , it 's not gonna go that far . Walter , there 's gotta be something that you can do . All right ? Hey , look at me . You can 't check out right now . We cannot let this man die . Don 't you think I know that , Peter ? Think , damn it . Agent Farnsworth , draw 25 milliliters of blood . Peter , get some trichlorimide . What are you gonna do ? Poison them . This is gonna pinch just a little bit . Careful , Peter , it 's highly toxic . If this doesn 't work , how much time do I have ? The last victim ... We figured 24 hours after he was ... Knocked up . Yeah . So I have about 16 hours . Careful . Okay , get your toy out . Hello ? Hey , Catherine - Woah , woah , slow down , honey . Be careful . Hey , yeah , sorry . Oh , the house . Yeah , we saw it yesterday . Oh . Perfect . I made a few calls for you . This is what I was able to get the army to declassify on Kelvin Genetics . Five lab assistants worked there with Dr. Bishop and William Bell . All of them now in the private sector . None working in biogenetics , as far as I can tell . And Robert Swift ? No connection . I 've been through the missing persons records a dozen times . There 's nothing from any of the local hospitals either . You 're still thinking there was a fourth activist . And if they 're out there and impregnated , then who knows how many more of these things we 're looking at . Though presumably , we 'd have heard something by now . Any more sightings ? Not any within the last ten hours . Maybe it 's gone . Maybe it went into the river or died from lack of proper food . Agent Dunham , Peter Bishop 's on line six . - Hey . - It 's bad news . The poison killed the larvae , but it also poisoned Charlie 's blood . Have you spoken to Charlie ? Yeah . He 's putting on a brave face but he 's not doing well . His blood pressure 's down . His kidneys are failing . I don 't understand . Walter seems to think that the larvae act like parasites , They feed on their host for nutrients . So they 're killing him so that they can gestate . Tell her , Peter , about the blood ? What blood ? Walter has a theory . He thinks he knows a way he can trick the larvae to self-destructing . How do we do that ? Well , we 'd have to transfuse Charlie with the creature 's blood . Mix their mother 's blood in with his own . That way , maybe the larvae would think he 's one of their own and stop feeding . Die of starvation . Which sounds crazy , I know . But he seems to think it 'll work . Okay . Then that 's what we 'll do . Bye . What ? We need to find the creature . It 's got three bedrooms , so if we want to have another baby we 'll be fine . Oh , and , uh ... The best part about it is it 's got this amazing yard . It 's even got a tree house for Tuck . Catherine , let me call you back . Tuck ! Tuck , come out of there . Tuck ! Tucker ! Medford , Waltham , Newton , and an unconfirmed report of a giant snake out of Watertown . What are you thinking ? It doesn 't make sense . I mean , something this big ... Why aren 't there more sightings ? This is just a mild sedative . It might make you feel more relaxed . Thanks . You 're welcome . I 'm sorry this has happened to you . It 's not your fault . They didn 't tell you . Tell me what ? The creature ... Where it came from . Astrid , I need a schematic of the sewers , section E-3 and F-5 . You 've had a thought ? Yeah , I think it 's traveling underground . Here you go . Thank you . Look at that . All the sightings are near major storm drains . And each one of them large enough to accommodate the creature . That makes sense . If it 's part tiger , then it would prefer dark . And a python would seek out water . So it 's probably only surfacing to eat ... Or to mate . What ? If it 's traveling in the sewer , then we have nothing . It could be anywhere . Walter , it 's okay . We 're making progress . No . It 's not okay . You tell Agent Francis it 's okay . I 'll go talk to him . - Ahh . Uhh . - Hang on , hang on , hang on . - Hold him down , hold him down . - Uhh . Charlie . Lift his shirt . They 're getting bigger . When ? Did you get any witness statements ? Okay , well , can you send me them as soon as you get them ? Thank you . Another sighting ? Yeah , this time in a public park off Hawthorne , which is nowhere near any of the other places . So there 's no predictable pattern . No , this thing could show up anytime , anywhere , and we 'd have no idea . Hello . Agent Dunham . Hey , this is Carl Bussler from M.I.T. Uh , what can I do for you , Carl ? Uh , you said to call if anything came up , and I think maybe something might have . What is it ? Uh , this kid Jonathan hasn 't been in class for the last few days . And I don 't know if he was friends with Chris or whatever , but he was into all that animal rights stuff too . Anyway , no one 's seen him . Okay , well , I 'll check it out . What 's his last name ? Uh , Swift . Jonathan Swift . Miss . You can 't go back there . Agent Dunham . You lied to me . I did ? You obstructed the course of a federal investigation into the deaths of five people . Will you excuse us for a minute ? Dr. Swift , you failed to tell me that your son Jonathan was at M.I.T. I 'm not sure how that 's relevant . Three of his classmates were torn , limb from limb , the other night , and he hasn 't been seen since . I would say that that would be very relevant . I don 't know how that happened , but my son was not involved . When was the last time you spoke to Jonathan ? A few days . He 's very busy at school . Yes , I know . Politically active . Animals First . He wasn 't too fond of the work you did here , was he ? I really can 't say . Is this going somewhere , Agent Dunham ? Yes , a motive . I believe that he found out about your studies . That your lab was testing on animals , and he and his friends broke in here two nights ago . But what he didn 't know ... was that you do much more than just testing on animals . You create them , dangerous genetic hybrids . We 're done here . Any further questions , you 're gonna have to go through my attorney . Dr. Swift , this thing has already killed five people and infected one of our agents . As we speak , it 's offspring is growing inside of him , killing him . Do you really want his death on your conscience ? Now your son is out there , maybe injured , maybe infected , and I can help . But you need to help me too . It didn 't kill five people . Excuse me ? It was seven . Hello . Hey , Swift broke . He admitted that the hybrid came from his laboratory . Apparently , he was collaborating with a geneticist called Cameron Degelmann . Oh . Well , where is this guy ? Uh , dead . He was at the lab along with Swift 's son when the students released the creature . So what is the link to Kelvin Genetics ? Well , that 's the interesting part . You got a pen ? Good news . That was Olivia . Swift confessed . Apparently , this monster has nothing to do with your work , Walter . What ? Well , Swift was working with a geneticist . For years , he was pursuing this work , a Cameron Degelmann . Degelmann , of course . Whoa , whoa , who 's Degelmann ? Pioneer in hybridization . Quite brilliant . In fact , it was his work that inspired my research in the first place . And it never even crossed your mind that he might be involved ? He had a very forgettable face . And in the more good news column , Olivia was able to get the combination of animals that went into the hybrid . Oh , oh , go on . Uh , Heloderma suspectum . Yes , a venomous lizard native to North America . Also called the Gila Monster . Megarhyssa macrurus . Parasitic wasp . Interesting . Desmodus rotundus and - Wait , did you say Desmodus rotundus ? Yeah . Why , what is that ? It 's a type of bat . Oh , of course . Why didn 't I think of it before ? Their immune system . Makes it a perfect candidate for genetic hybridization . I 'm lost . Bats have an immune system that 's unique in the animal kingdom . They can carry on hundreds of different diseases without ever being affected . That same system makes it possible for the creature to mature without rejecting its various parts . The bat was the missing ingredient ... that allowed the creature to survive . So now that you know what it is , can you help Charlie ? No . We 'll still need a specimen of the creature 's blood . Okay . Okay , well , we know what it 's made of . We know that it moves through the sewer . So can 't we ... I don 't know , Like , bait it or something ? Just so I 'm clear , are you actually suggesting that we go down into the sewers and wait for this thing to eat us ? - Oh , no . - Yes ! - Yes . - Oh , no . No ? - It 's not interested in food . - No . But we do have something that it is interested in . Bats are a highly maternal species . They are quite protective of their young . Walter , are you saying that we can lure this thing by dangling those larvae in front of it ? Yes . But no . Oh , great , this again . It won 't be necessary to be in front of it . Bats are capable of seeking out their offspring from miles away . We 've already determined that it 's traveling through the sewer systems . So we just need to lure it from the central location . Wonderful , so we 're gonna antagonize this thing into chasing us and then what , Walter ? Well , now that I have a better idea of its biological makeup , I think I can kill it . Assuming that you can provide us with 50-caliber incendiary rounds , Agent Dunham . Well , that 's not exactly FBI standard-issue , Walter . Are you sure about this ? Hey . If my theory is correct and the bat traits are dominant in the creature , then yes , I believe we can successfully lure it . Whether we can survive the encounter is the more intriguing question . Okay , we 're missing anything ? Could you carry these , son ? Sure thing . Be careful . You must be very gentle with them . Right , ' cause we wouldn 't want to hurt the monster babies . You need anything ? A shot of J.D. and a chaser of beer would be nice . You know , hunting this thing in the sewers ... It 's not a good idea , Liv . You got a better idea ? Yeah . Don 't get hurt for me . Well , that 's not really very fair . Considering you would do the same thing for me . I 'll be back soon , I promise . You will call me if his condition changes . I will . We ready ? Ready as I 'll ever be . Walter , let 's go . Be right there , son . Based on the sewer map , this will make a fine infiltration point . Nothing to see here , ma 'am . Just routine maintenance . Smells great down here . So what 's next , Walter ? There 's an intersection a 100 feet down here ... that will conduct the sound most effectively . Nearly there . The larvae are creating a vibration ... Frequencies of sound ... detectable by bats . And hopefully , our guest of honor . Well , now I know what it feels like to be live bait . Hey , come on , let 's get in position . Hello . You just get in ? Hi . I thought it might be you . I just got in from the market . I ran into Jody . What is it ? Oh , uh , she just told me a really funny joke . Tell me . So the patient goes to his doctor and he says , " Doctor , if I give up wine , women , and song , " will I live longer ? " And the doctor says , " Well , no . " But it 'll feel longer . " You don 't think that 's funny . I do . No , you don 't . Are you gonna be home for dinner ? I don 't know . Okay , all right . Well , I will see you when you get home . And I love you , babe ... Even more for laughing at that joke . And I love you too . Bye-bye . Frightening situation like this ... Two things occur to me . The first is a song I used to sing to Rufus . Our dog . When he was young , he used to have night terrors . Hey , Walter . Think we can wait down here to be mauled in silence , please ? Of course . So what was the second thing ? Hmm ? You said two things occur to you . Oh , the second thing . I need to tinkle . Could either of you direct me to the facilities ? The facilities ? You 're in the sewer , Walter . You 're knee-deep in the facilities . Quite right . Excuse me . Don 't say that I never take you anywhere . Hey ! Open this up right now . I 'm afraid I can 't do that , Peter . No one else is going to get hurt . This thing is a mistake , and I 'm going to correct it alone . Walter , hey ! Walter , you open this gate right now . You were right , Peter . I live in a society . And I need to clean up after myself . Walter , this is not your fault . You did not do this . No . But I could have . - I pursued the same science ... - Walter , Walter . You 're not prepared for this . That thing could tear you apart . That 's right . I almost forgot . I 've already ... considered that possibility . Walter , is that the trichlorimide ? No . No , no , no ! What are you doing ? That 's gonna kill you . Should the creature consume me , it will only be poisoning itself . Afterwards , you remove its blood and save Agent Francis . Walter , listen to me . I don 't want you to do this . Okay ? Do you hear what I 'm saying ? I do not want you to do this . Should I live , there 's an antidote in the lab , which I should ingest within the hour . So time is of the essence . Walter . Walter , stop right there . Walter , come back here ! Stop right now ! Walter ! Selfish son of a bitch . If he lives through this , I am gonna kill him myself . Oh , dear God . Walter ! Walter ! Ohh ! Are you okay ? Yes . Although , when I mentioned that the poison would kill me within the hour , did either of you happen to notice the time ? That 's it then ? Now we wait . Prepare Agent Francis for the ultrasound . What ? Sonia and I ... We 've been talking a lot lately ... About having a baby . Sorry , I gotta gel you up . You were right . What you said before , about the consequences , I don 't think of them , never have . Don 't know if I can . That 's not who I am . I know . But you were brave today . Yeah . Checking on Agent Francis . Let 's look in on our little friends . It didn 't work . Ever the pessimist . Look . They 're dying . What happens now ? Now you crap ' em out . Hey , you 're home . Yeah . You feel good . So do you .

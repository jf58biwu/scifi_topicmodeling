 They aren 't much to look at , are they ? Well , we didn 't build them to do pretty things . Hey , doc . - When did he get the religion ? - I wouldn 't call it religion per se . - He 's spiritual . - That 's different . Yeah , two months ago , I received a call in the middle of the night . I hadn 't seen him for a week . He told me he 'd been in the desert and that he 'd been tested . He wasn 't himself . Go on . Well , every man , even great men experience moments of doubt when they 're tired and afraid . Afraid of what ? He told me that this was a war that would never end . That if we stay this course the Bugs will and must destroy the human race . So he 's lost his nut . Extraordinary , 10 out of 10 . He had an episode . I gave him a sedative . The next day he told me not to worry , that he 'd talked to God . Doc , if I told you I was talking to God , would you clear me for flight ? I ... Is the SM unfit for command ? I find this a very uncomfortable conversation , captain . If I need to assume command , I 'm gonna need your help because the others won 't understand . We could both hang . Is your loyalty to the SM or the Federation ? Don 't blame the cook , folks . The SM goes first . Just water . Bull , you have mine . Are you sure , sir ? Well , I 'm sure we 'll need your strength . Thank you , sir . If you don 't mind , can we maybe say a prayer before we eat ? Of course . Dr. Wiggs ? Captain Beck , how about you ? I 'll be checking the perimeter , sir . We thank thee , Lord , for the meal we 're about to receive . Please bless us and keep us . Protect us from all evil and guide us that we may know the way to you . Amen . - Amen . - Amen . Can I ask you a question , sir ? Of course , Bull . They are gonna come looking for us , won 't they , sir ? Because of you . We are on a mission of the greatest importance , Bull . Even if we do not now understand our purpose . Yes , sir . But we are gonna be rescued . I mean , you do know that , don 't you ? Because you 're psychic . I know how people around me feel , and sometimes I can speak to them but no one can predict the future , Bull . I have a question for you . For all of you . Do you have faith ? I believe . I know you do , Holly . Your faith is clear and serene . I wanna believe too , sir . I really do . Well , that 's the start of it , Bull . Dr. Wiggs , how about you ? I believe in you , sir . Well , careful now , Dr. Wiggs . See , I 'm only a man . Earthquake . Incoming ! Incoming ! Help me ! Bull ! - Jingo , Jingo . - Hold on . Hold on , Jingo . Come on , come on ! Jesus . Where 's Wiggs ? Dr. Wiggs ? Dr. Wiggs ? Wiggs ? Doc ? Wiggs ? Doc ? Good to see you again , troopers . You are now all part of a classified mission . Talk about it and they will hang you . Get me ? We get you , sir . What exactly is the Marauder program , sir ? - I 'm not currently at liberty to say . - Sir , is the mission survivable , sir ? We 'll find out , trooper . You know what I think , sir ? - What 's that , sergeant ? - I think it 's a good day to die , sir . Outstanding . Glad you feel that way . Because today , we 're headed out for the Arachnid Quarantine Zone . - Saddle up , troopers . - Sir , yes , sir . Hauzer for Lamb . / I 'm sorry , general , Lieutenant Lamb 's been transferred . Where ? / I 'm sorry , sir , I can 't tell you that . What ? - Dix , come in . - You are going to hang Lamb ? Little redhead , sad eyes , big mouth ? Why ? That is what happens to traitors , Dix . Seems like you know all about traitors , admiral . Maybe I 'm looking at one right now . So you 're gonna hang me too ? Well , a lot of that going around these days . What happens to you when the council finds out you suppressed the sky marshal 's rescue call ? And exactly who would tell them such a thing ? You give me the coordinates for Planet OM-1 , resign and I keep my mouth shut . I 'm sorry , Dix . But very shortly , Omar Anoke will be dead and honored as a hero of the Federation and I will be the next sky marshal . Over my dead body . That your last request , general ? / Federal Council members were called together today ... / ... by Sky Marshal Anoke for his weekly report . How are you doing , sir ? Good to see you . / Then ... disaster . / A bomb carried by a member of the Goniff Peace Coalition explodes . / Among the missing : / Sky Marshal Anoke and his loyal aide , General Dix Hauzer . Today , each and every one of us has been attacked by a man who would demand peace at all costs . A man who calls himself a citizen . A man who is no better than a Bug . / - One more day of fighting ... - That man is Elmo Goniff ... / ... self-proclaimed pacifist turned terrorist . / And today , he and other members of the Goniff Peace Coalition ... / ... are wanted in connection with the council bombing . / And , hey , citizen , you can help . / - Know your neighbors ? - Turn that f * * * ing thing off . / - Take another look , citizen . - Who , me ? / You could be living next door to a big , fat reward . / If you see something , say something . We 're in the Arachnid Quarantine Zone . Do you know what that means ? This is a Bug planet . They could come for us at any time , right ? - Upstairs , downstairs , you can 't tell . - Save your breath , Jingo . Yeah , but they could be under our feet right now . You can 't tell . - You don 't know , right ? - Listen to me , okay ? I 'll tell you when to run . No , you can 't tell me when to run , because I 'm a cook , okay ? I take short orders , I 'm not a ... Get your shit wired . You 're a bitch . Let 's move . - You 're wasting water , Jingo . - I hate you . - Oh , God . - It 's okay , Holly . Oh , that 's it , I 'm out of here . Hold your ground , Jingo . That 's an order . Captain Beck , we need to talk . We 're fucked . That 's exactly what I 've been saying . You shouldn 't talk like that . That 's blasphemy . You 're a goddamn flight attendant , so stow it . We never should have left the goddamn beach . This is all a big mistake . Now we got warriors fucking earthquakes , and we even lost the doc . Did you forget that ? And it 's your fault . You know , if we 'd stayed at the beach then we could just be lying in the sand . And if the Bugs did show up , well , then we just jump in the water . I mean , Bugs don 't swim , right ? Do they ? - Jingo , behind you . - Jingo , watch your back . Yeah . Very funny . You know what ? Screw you guys . I 'm going back to the beach . - Jingo . - Jingo . Jingo , don 't . Hold on , Jingo . Damn it . Fucker . It 's moving off . Hold your fire . Save the ammo . - Jingo , get out of there , now . - No way . We ought to get in there with him . Let 's go . Chief , those aren 't rocks . Get out of there now . - Come on , Holly , let 's go . Sir , let 's go . - No , my friends . He belongs to God . What are you talking about ? No . No , no . No . And where 's your God now ? Let 's move . Even though you don 't believe it , captain , he is listening . - And soon , we will be delivered . - Do you really believe that , sir ? Yes , Holly . I do . How do you know ? Because he talks to me even now , Captain Beck . He talks to me even now . All right , listen up . The hardware you 'll be operating interfaces directly with your nervous system . That 's outstanding , sir . Please remove your clothing . What are you gonna do if you don 't buy the farm ? I 'm thinking R and R. They might even let us go home . Home ? What 's that ? Peace and quiet , family . Remember ? Yeah , that 's all I want when this is done . Yeah , I just can 't wait for it to be over and start living again . Hasn 't anybody told you , sergeants ? Mobile Infantry is only good for dying . They need to come up with a bigger weapon so they can finish this thing and we can go home . Yeah . Bye-bye , Bugs . What will you do when the war is over , sir ? What are you people talking about ? This war is never gonna end . / Take your place , number two . I guess that 's why his mama called him Slug . Prepare for full-spectrum bioscan . / DDQ , five-by-five . / Commencing Gamma Jetta Bonza . Did you participate in Anoke 's interrogation of the Brain , general ? No . So you don 't know about the side effects ? What side effects ? It seems anybody who spends too much time around that Bug suffers deleterious effects , both physical and psychological . - Not the sky marshal . - So it seemed . Truth is , we didn 't fully understand the Brain 's capabilities . - Sir . - Welcome to Area 6 , admiral . - Necessary personnel only . - Yes , sir . / All unauthorized personnel , exit Area 6 immediately . / All unauthorized personnel , exit Area 6 immediately . So , general , how well did you really know the sky marshal ? I worked with him every day . So you knew he got religion . - What are you talking about ? - General . There 's something I think you should see . Run the Anoke file . This is surveillance footage of Anoke with the Brain Bug . We just recently discovered it . He 's psychically connected with it . They communicate . / I understand . / And I come here as your servant , Behemecoytal . - That thing has a name ? - Yeah . But that 's not this Bug . Behemecoytal is likely some Bug we 've never encountered before . A superior arachnid intelligence originating on the planet OM-1 . OM-1 ? We believe this Brain allowed itself to be captured . To provide intelligence from the heart of the Federation . And Anoke used the Brain to commune with this Behemecoytal . A Bug he regards as God . / Yes , Roku San will fall as proof of my faith . / Then we can discuss the terms of peace . Anoke 's responsible for Roku San ? He had the codes to shut down the fences . He made a pact with the Bug to render Roku San defenseless . And in light of his conversion he 's become an asset to the Bugs and a tremendous liability for us . - Making friends ? - You can 't be friends with a Bug . That 's why we 're gonna put this one down take it apart , and find out what it knows . Close the containment . Admiral , you okay ? Yeah . Yeah . Look at him . The most powerful man in the galaxy finds God and what does he do ? Exactly what he 's told . He 's a Bug . Doesn 't think , doesn 't protest , doesn 't rebel . That 's the kind of attitude that wins wars . You know , Dix I think these Bugs are onto something . This could just be the greatest weapon of them all . How does he do it ? That 's faith , Bull . That 's what it does for a man . Give it a break . Faith is more powerful than a Q-bomb . Without it , you 're nobody . That 's why I 'm not listening to you anymore , captain . Holly , if we ever get out of this , I was wondering if ... Well ... What is it , Bull ? Would you ever marry an old monkey wrench like me ? Only in a church , Bull . You mean it ? You take God and you can take me . What we 've come for . It 's here . I never doubted it for a second , sir . If I didn 't believe before , I do now . - Honey , everything 's gonna be okay . - All will be well , Bull . And you will know the name of God . The one true God . Behemecoytal . Brain of Brains . - Beheme-what ? - Behemecoytal . He 's here . He 's everywhere . Come , and let us rest and wait for his coming . They say God has many names , but I 've never heard that one before . Well , honey , he 's the sky marshal . He knows a lot more than we do . He 's talking about a Bug . He thinks God is a Bug ? He 's got religion . Their religion . - Bug religion ? - That 's crazy . That 's blasphemy . What do we do now ? Maybe we should kill him . Why , because he 's crazy ? Or he believes in God like you ? It 's the wrong God . - Guard the door . - I 'm no trooper . Greetings , citizen . Excuse me , sir . - What went wrong ? - An air leak . The ship landed itself . They were dead before they hit the atmosphere . Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue . Come in , Fleet . Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue . Come in , Fleet . We could make orbit if I can solve the O2 problem . Solve it , chief . Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue . Come in . / Sierra Mike Uniform , this is Fleet Rescue , over . We are requesting priority pickup on Planet Oscar Mike-One for SM and three additional survivors . Holly , don 't move . Let 's go , baby . Go , baby . Bull . No ! No ! It 's all around . - It 's Behemecoytal . - No , it 's hell . - Come on , Holly . - We 're in hell ! Clear the door , Holly . We may not be able to make orbit . - But we can sure get out of here . - We must remain here , captain . No , sir , we are off this rock . Oh , great one . Lord . The day has arrived that I stand before you . Let our communion begin . Yes . Yes . It 's time to talk . Jingo , is that you ? This one speaks for us that we may talk to you as a man . That you may be comfortable among your own kind . Among your trusted advisors and servants whom we have made believers . Thank you , Lord . That you care for me so much fills me with love and joy and confidence that we can and will create a great new understanding . You will be one with us . So that I may come to know you . You will know what we know . And that you will come to know me , and through me all of humankind . What are you doing ? I am here to negotiate peace with a being superior to us . - What , appeasement ? - No , Captain Beck . The survival of the human race . We will all be saved . Forgive me . My people have much to learn . - They are fearful and ... - As were you once , Anoke . I was weak . When you asked for the lives of so many at Roku San , I doubted . But now I understand that great achievement requires great sacrifice . You gave them Roku San . Traitor . Within that woman you will find Sanctuary . I have given you the key that will end this conflict once and for all so that your law may rule and paradise follow ... You 're a liar . Seducer . He of a thousand names . Oh , great one , Lord would you please take these women from me and kill them ? And why do you wish this ? I have made this great journey . I have evolved . I have sacrificed all so that I may create with you a great peace . And they 're fucking it up . We too seek peace , but by different means . We seek knowledge . Knowledge is the key to understanding and to communication . And only by this way can our species so different , live together in harmony and mutual resp ... You will become one with us and provide the knowledge necessary to pacify the human species . Oh , Lord . Yes . Your plans , the disposition of your armies your fleet . Yes , what 's mine is yours . Take me unto you , oh , great one . Yes . Yes . Pray with me , Lola . What ? Lord , please hear my prayer . Deliver us from this evil place . - Come on , Lola , pray with me . - It doesn 't make any difference . Lord , send us an army of angels . And arm them with your fire and your sword that they might smite the evil around us . What is it , Lola ? Lola , what is it ? Come on , Lola , don 't you wanna live ? Yes , I wanna live . Well , when you 're all out of hope , God is all you get . Now , say it . - Our father . - Our father . - Who art in heaven . - Who art in heaven . Hallowed be they name . - Thy kingdom come . - Thy kingdom come . - Thy will be done . - Thy will be done . - On Earth as it is in heaven . - On Earth as it is in heaven . / All right , troopers , let 's fix this hive . Archies everywhere . / As we forgive those who trespass against us . / - Searching for survivors . - And lead us not into temptation . / - Got them . - And deliver us from evil . Let 's move in . / Rolling in . Rolling in . / We got visual . / Hold your fire . / Wait for my command . / - We got visual , we got contact . - Wait for it . / Ready . Wait for it . / We got contact . I 'm moving in for guns . / Keep your cool . Hold that line , trooper . Say it again , Lola . Say it again . - Our father who art in heaven . - Who art in heaven . - Hallowed by thy name . - Hallowed by thy name . / Fire in the hole . - On Earth as it is in heaven . - On Earth as it is in heaven . / Open up . Everything you got . / Initiate wide dispersal on my mark . / - Three , two ... - And forgive us our trespasses . / Fire ! / Weed them out . Nothing lives . / Get some , get some , get some . / Archie . / Dual target . - Amen . - Amen . All right , cook them . Come on , Lola , let 's go home . You killed a lot of Bugs down there , John . - Too bad the big one got away . - Well , it 's a big Bug . Our guys can 't tell where the Bug ends and the planet begins . Hard to imagine anything could live through all that . - I did . - You 're hard to kill . / The Bug is big . / We have lock . Captain Beck . I 've heard a lot about you . I 'm hoping you 'll take command of my flagship . But when you 've had a little time off . Yes , ma 'am . Congratulations , Colonel Rico . Marauder is a big success . - Thank you , ma 'am . - Oh , thank Dix . My new number two doesn 't always take no for an answer . I wasn 't sure we should mix business with pleasure . - Are we ready to deploy the Q-bomb ? - On your command . All right , people . Let 's go crack a planet . So they wanna make you a general , John . Put you in charge of the whole Marauder program . I 'm only good for one thing , Dix . Give me a squad and let me fight . At least think about it . Maybe you two wanna be alone . I 'll see you on the bounce . / Alpha Gamma Bonza . Now . I wanted to ask you ... Would you ? I will . Really ? - That 's wonderful . - But you need to know one thing . Yeah ? Something happened to me down there and ... / Thirty seconds to impact . - Something that I can 't explain . - What ? But if you wanna marry me , we have to do it in a church . / - What ? - Twenty seconds to impact . I got religion , Dix . I got it bad . / Ten seconds .

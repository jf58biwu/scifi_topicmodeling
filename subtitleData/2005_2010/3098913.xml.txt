 I don 't know who you are , sitting out here in the dark . I don 't know exactly what your beliefs are ... but I guess that what I 'm going to say will hurt your feelings ... We are you and I , the offspring of the most aggressive elements of our lineage . We are here because they managed to survive ... sometimes at any cost ... We are by far the most dangerous species on earth . Man is one of the few species that kills for pleasure ... that is capable of murder . Just like our ancestors , you and I got ourselves in this auditorium by eliminating our rivals . From those primitive ancestors , we inherited a " reptilian " brain , home of our wild instincts . At some point , we developed a limbic system , which gave us emotions . Then , recently only 500,000 years ago a third brain ... the " neocortex " , grew on top of the other two ... Between those three radically different brains , the conflict is permanent . Hence our irrational behavior . We tried everything to tame ourselves . Religion Freud neuroleptic repression capital punishment ... Nothing works . Today , genetics offers a new perspective . For the first time of his History , Man will be able to change man , to terminate the predator in him . Any questions ? Isn 't this ambition a little sacrilegious ? Genetics doesn 't claim to correct Nature 's errors , no ... Genetics doesn 't claim . A Department of molecular Biology Somewhere in Europe Maybe tomorrow ... Come on , darling . Grandpa 's waiting . Watch your step . Is that Santa Claus there ? Do you see what I see ? Come on . Watch your step . Wait ! Don 't make me run . I want to see Santa . Come over here , boy . - Good evening mom . - Good evening . - Isn 't it beautiful ? - yeah , mom . - Mummy , it 's a wolf ! - Yes , that 's a wolf . That 's a wolf isn 't it ? My son is crazy about wolves . Your dog just looks like a wolf . We don 't have a dog . You don 't have a dog ? - My god ! Max ! - My god ! It 's ... it 's a wolf ... Everybody , it 's a wolf . Don 't move ! ID please . " Doctor " Thomas Nielsen ? Yes , I 'm not a professor yet . Jacket , please . Hi . David Getner . Vincent Ipparak 's therapist . Thomas Nielsen . I have to say , I expected somebody ... Older ? The D. A is a friend of the Dean . She also allowed me to take some additional samples for my own research . This way ... So what exactly is your specialty ? The neurobiochemistry of aggressiveness . It is the subject of my PhD . You 've certainly knocked on the right door . - Access , please ? - Level Four . This isn 't death row yet , but clearly Vincent Iparrak is facing a death penalty . Let 's say his chances are ... nil . This way , please . I 'm lost . So would our special " guests " be if they were to try to escape . Any signs of remorse ? None . He sleeps like a baby , eats like a horse ... but I 'm pretty confident I 'll end up finding some kind of severe childhood - trauma which will tell us ... - You won 't find anything . Of course . You ... you believe he was born this way . Wasn 't it Freud who said " What I cannot explain , biology will ? " Did he , really ? Well , I 'll take your word for that . Here . " I 'm crazy about you , I 'm sending you my best picture " " dripping with his blood a sinister signature the drawing of a hunting knife " " a witness described it as the worst bloodbath he 'd ever seen ... " " no more murder , mister hunter kneel and pray for your preys " " Caught ! The country is signed with relief especially women ... " " El serial killer es el mas buscado del continente europeo " " He 's going to be charged for 93 counts of murder I didn 't see how he could escape the lethal injection " " every night , thinking of your mouth on me , your hands on me " My fan club . Vincent , this is Doctor Thomas Nielsen , a brilliant geneticist attached to the Department of Molecular Biology . Has your work ever been published ? I couldn 't find you on the Web . I can manage on my own , thanks . Come on , Jack . I am notoriously heterosexual . Ask Getner . Well , I 'll ... I 'll see you in a while . - You have one message . - Listening . Hi this is Paul . We are all thrilled by your first chapter , - please call me back - My publisher . He 's harassing me . He predicts a hit . You write ? My memoirs . You don 't waste time , do you ? Well , I write to kill time only thing that 's left for me to kill , right ? No , your hand , please . I 'm surprised you 're allowed to communicate with the outside world . They scan every word . Only thing they can 't do is listen to our conversation . It 's " illegal " , remember ? Right now , they 're obsessed with one thing only ... " The bodies , where are the bodies ? " How the fuck would I remember ? Never been very tidy to start with . Any problems ? Like what ? Nightmares ? I don 't have nightmares , Doctor ... I am one . Open your mouth please ... So ? That 's it ? No twisted questions about my childhood , my fantasies ? Nothing you say , think or feel has any significance for a biologist . What does ? Blood , bone marrow , sperm . Really ? - It can tell me if you were ... ... if I was born like this . Now that should inspire my lawyers . But the experts stated I was " lucid " . Weren 't you ? Course I was . Lucid , right down to their very last little breath ... And now some rational bastard is going to inject me with rational death . Not if I can prove you 're not responsible . What 's that ? No one can be held responsible for his DNA . Meaning ? I can save your life . You know , my poor old mother used to say " If a priest begins to talk salvation , watch out for your wallet " . What do you want ? Can you read me ? A Commando is on its way . Please keep everyone quiet down there . Copy that . Remain as silent as possible , I repeat as silent as possible . Mom . Well done , my boy . - Thank you , thank you . - Is the wolf dead ? No , he 's alright ... Nice shot ! The wolf is yours ? No , we introduce them into the wild . Not into the public . Excuse me . Damn it , Justine . Why did you hesitate ? He could have attacked that kid ! He should have . That 's what puzzles me . It 's Christmas . Yes , well , I don 't believe in miracles . Hi , boy . How come you 're so sweet ? Too sweet to be true . You robbed a bank ? No . A Private lab . U Man Tech . You like my starting bonus ? I told them I was a collector . I 'm renting them out my brain and what 's inside . And what happens when they realize there 's nothing in there ? Do they repossess the car ? See you in the Kendo room ! You 'll get thrashed , as usual . I can 't stand that arrogant prick . How come I still haven 't punched him in the mouth ? Your neocortex . The civilized part of your brain . Yeah , well sometimes I hate being civilized ... I mean and to think that jerk 's going to head the lab ... What ? Is Frydman leaving ? No , he 's retiring . Where have you been ? In my lab , I guess . Yeah , well if the gene of ambition ever gets discovered , I 'll get you an implant . See you later . - Hi Doctor . - Hi Ross . Hi . Hi , Lohan . Hello . And goodbye . Don 't tell me ... Sorry . Sebastian 's expanding his team . - He signed up with " U Man Tech " - " U Man Tech " , I know , the whole campus knows ! How much ? It 's not the money , Thomas . What else ? It 's you ! " U Man Tech " wanted to sign up with you . They changed their mind . Because you changed the field of research , We were supposed to be working on manic depression , remember ? The Dean was thrilled , " U Man Tech " was thrilled . Thrilled by the prospect of profits . What 's wrong with that ? Violence is more than a subject , you know what it means , it 's a course . It 's a dead end . It 's too controversial . You 're trying to demonstrate how some people are born " evil " and others " good " . Not " Evil " , for Christ sake , " Aggressive " . For the public , it 's the same , don 't you see ? We 'll never get to experiment on humans . Not right now , maybe , but ... Yeah , and when ? Twenty years from now ? We 're here with almost no grants , no equipment , no team , in this fantastic lab which by the way , we are suppose to leave in less than three months . Come on ! We can come up with a breakthrough in a smaller place . Look , you shouldn 't leave , not now ... I 'm about to ... To what ? See ? You don 't trust me . You put access codes on everything . I don 't even know what exactly we 're working on . Sorry , but I am fed up working on pit bulls for a great cause without a future . It was great , wasn 't it ? The research or the sex ? Sorry to keep you waiting . I wasn 't very inspired . You should 've brought a picture of your girlfriend . She 's probably too old for you . Or was . She dead ? No . She dumped me . That would never have happened to me . So did you find something ? A low level of Serotonin , to start with . And the scanner shows your amygdale is abnormally small . Anything " normal " ? You 're " O " negative . Just like me . Good ! Anything happens to you , I 'll give you my degenerate blood . I know what you want ... Really ? You want to turn me into a saint . Careful now ! I can 't do it on call . Don 't panic . Your secret 's safe with me . So that 's the big idea ? A world without people like me . I could make you a new man . A new " me " ? I don 't know , I tend to like myself , don 't you ? That 's interesting . I like myself but you don 't . I need an answer . See , Evil is the show , Goodness just the intermission . And I , well , I am a star , in my own " gory " category . What if it affects my sex appeal ? These little lovelies would stop writing ... - Do you get laid ? - I need an answer . You 're brilliant , but you 're not listening . Brilliance is not enough to succeed , Doctor . Ambition is not enough . Even being the best is not enough . You also have to lead of the pack . You have to inspire fear . Some kind of fear . Any kind of fear ! Are you feared , Thomas ? Make up your mind ! I 'm thinking , okay ? Well , think faster . Another creep 's probably already out and working at breaking your record . You 're freaking me out , you know that ? What choice do you have ? - Thank you . - Okay . Okay . It 's all right . You know what to do . Need something ? I 've been told you fix anything . What about this ? Sorry , the stuff 's off the market . Can 't get the spare parts . I bought it six months ago ! Six months is a light year , love . That was her last show . That kid was so gifted ... I can try to get you the same one , second hand . So ? Sorry ? Do you want it ? Yeah , sure . Ok , let 's order it . We had seats for her last show , when was it , Jules ? About ... five years ago . Yeah , and on that same night , we learned about the assault . It was awful , wasn 't it ? Poor girl ... It ruined her life . And her career ! What was her name ? - Maria Nielsen . - Yeah , that 's right . Can I have some identification ? Thanks . We 'll call you soon as it comes in , Mister ... Nielsen ? Did you hear that ? He said his name was Nielsen ... Maria ? Sorry . Thought you were out . The curtains were shut . I don 't need light , remember ? Hi ! How are you ? - Fine , and you ? - Good . Music volume down . - You want a drink ? - Sure . - I 'm having water . - Fine . I 've been exercising for hours . What time is it ? It 's about noon . It 's Monday , right ? Tuesday . I 've been at the lab for the last four days . I can tell that . You smell like a little fox . You 're such a pest ! It isn 't too much of a disaster , right ? I don 't know how you manage . You just need to be extra tidy , that 's all . Are you staying ? Yeah , I 'm taking you out for lunch . I 'd rather stay home and cook . Then let 's call Julius . He wanted to see you . Don 't insist . It was the same Justine Keller who tranquillized the wolf . Volume up . Oddly enough and fortunately for the child , - the wild animal behaved like a lamb . - Julius ? Are you in front of a TV ? - Needless to say that ... - No I 'm next door , why ? Well , come to the lab . Many here consider this a Christmas miracle ! Don 't tell me , is that ... Our wolf ? Yeah ... - How did he ? - The window was ajar . But I 'd closed it ! Man , shit ! But , they can 't trace him , can they ? I mean , they 'll never suspect he escaped from this lab . Still need to get him back here , though . Well , there 's no drug in his system , no news from a circus or a zoo , nada . I don 't get it . Me neither ... Hello ? Justine , it 's for you . Another journalist ? No , it 's from the University . Hello ? Who ? I 'm sorry I didn 't catch your name . This is Doctor Thomas Nielsen . Do you think I could see that wolf ? Watch it ! Back ! Back ! Get back ! Are you ok ? - Sure ? - Yes . I can 't believe you turned your back to him ! I know , I know that was stupid . This is Jake Helliott my assistant . - Hi . - Hi . Justine Keller . Thomas Nielsen . This is Julius Martin . - Hi . - Hi . So , where 's the wolf ? He 's up here , follow me . We couldn 't put him with the others they would 've killed him . Wait . Let 's be clear . I said you can " examine " him . You can 't " open " him . That was never my intention . This is just about a few genetic tests . The only reason this wolf is leaving my field station , is that you might find something that I 've missed . I got it . - Can I get inside ? - Yes , he 's totally docile ... Easy boy . Jake ? Give him a hand , will you ? Sure . - Coffee ? - Sure . My temporary home . I just got here . Where from ? Lots of places , like most of us . Germany . China . Canada . Mongolia . - How about you ? Where are you from ? - Stockholm . Homesick ? Not anymore . I moved ten years ago . No family here ? No . What about you ? Do you feel a little isolated here ? I don 't know . I kind of like to wake up in the middle of the woods , take my breakfast with the wolves . Tranquil , you know ? I love nature . You have to , to do what I 'm doing . You know I don 't understand why you geneticists fight it so hard . Well , because it 's brutal , unfair and merciless , that 's why . Well , you clearly don 't think like the rest for us . We 're all set . I 'll send you the results It might take a couple of weeks . Take good care of my boy , okay ? I 'm gonna miss him . Justine , Wait , his diet ! Yeah , no carbohydrates , don 't forget his vitamins and , yogurt twice a day . And here 's my number . Call me anytime . I will . - What ? - What , what ? You tell me . Nothing . She 's great . And as free as a little bird as are you now . Easy there ... We 're old friends , remember . Yeah , I know boss ... but you never know . ... stop calling me " boss " ! - Sure , boss ! Hello ? Justine Keller ? Speaking . Hi . It 's Thomas Nielsen . I 've good news . Your wolf seems back to normal . What time is it ? Sorry . Did I wake you ? Yes , but ... but what were you saying ? I was saying your wolf seems back to normal . Really ? Positive . I 'll pick him up at your lab , so I 'll get to see where you work ! Great ! I mean ... when ? How about tomorrow ? But ... I mean I can come later if you ... No , no , no ! See you tomorrow . - Alright . Good night . - Good night . Where are the blood sample kits ? I 've got one here . - Do you need a hand with that ? - No ! Does Doctor Nielsen know about this ? No and I don 't need his permission . Besides , in a couple of weeks time , he 'll have to ask for mine . - Shit ! - A rabies shot , quick ! - Thought you said he was harmless ? - He was . I don 't know wha ... Terminate the fucking wolf ! - No it 's ok , you can 't , you can 't ... - You heard what I said ! Your pet friend has just tried to eat me alive . He 's got to go . You know the rules . No , wait ! That wolf is my responsibility . Exactly who am I talking to ? Doctor Keller , she is with the Field station . Julius ? Get the wolf onto Dr. Keller 's van . Right . This is my research , I 'm handling this ! You 're sending him free ? You 're taking a risk . Wolves are on the endangered species . They are protected by law . Maybe I wish I was endangered too . Maybe then I might benefit from your compassion . Excuse me . Thanks for your help . I should go . I 'll meet you downstairs , I 'm parked in the back . Yes , Madam . - Call me sometime . - I will . Mama told me you 're not going home for New Year 's ? You have other plans ? No . You can 't continue living like a recluse . Stop patronizing . You 're not going home either . Too much work . What kind ? A predator . Isn 't it a little illegal ? You 're going too far . You know why . I never asked you to do that . I know . Stop torturing yourself . I was supposed to be home with you that night . You had your exams ! It wasn 't your fault . I 'd like to believe that , even for one second . I 'd do anything , anything ... It 's alright ... You 're early . I was sunbathing . Are you ready ? What ? You mean now ? We 've got 20 minutes . We 've got to eternity , as far as I 'm concerned . I have a few questions first . Like what are my chances ? I succeeded . Once . On a wolf . Command sunset . That was you ? Impressive . What are the risks ? Come on . I 'm a big boy . Cellular degeneration . Necrosis . Collapsing of the immune system . Lymphomas . Malignant brain tumors . Or a new trial , reprieve , and eternal glory ... See you at your autopsy . Wait ! Does it hurt ? You won 't feel anything . Great . I 'm not big on pain . I 'm going to inject through the part where there is no bone resistance ... your eyelid . What 's in the syringe , Doc ? A virus . A what ? The virus of the common flu . Disarmed , and reloaded with a new code . We call this serum a " vector " . An " RNA Messenger " . It will deliver a counter order into your nervous system ... - and that counter order is ... - " Though shalt not kill " . Anyway ... you can 't make me worse than I am , can you ? Lie down . Let 's get some privacy here . You call this painless ? Time to say goodbye to " The Hunter " . Camera failure , cell 27 . Don 't you dare do that again , you dickhead ! - Hey Cindy ! - Hi Julius ! Two more please . Your usual potion ? Yeah , for my cheerful friend , here . So ? What 's the big secret ? Come on ... Okay , what 's the story with the Blue Lagoon ? Let me finish this first . What can you possibly have to confess to ? No introduction , right ? Right . I 've asked Justine to join our little group . To make her forgive my stupid behavior , you know ? The other day . You did well . So , the two of you are working on something ? - No . - No . Have fun . I told you to call her ! I screwed up , right ? You , you never screw anything up . Except my life . See you . Where 's Getner ? On his way . Leave me with him . Get the fuck out ! Don 't you touch me ! When did it start ? Tell me . You 're under experimental treatment . I need all the details . Yeah , of course ... A rat couldn 't tell you what 's going on in his little rat 's head ! I 'm here to help , for Christ sake ! I hear them ... It never stops ... They 're crying ... Who 's crying ? They 're begging me not to kill them . I don 't believe this ... It 's hell , and you don 't give a fuck ! No . You don 't get it . It 's a great day . You don 't understand what this means . It 's a nightmare , Thomas , a horror movie I can 't stop ! I can give you sedative . A sedative ... I can 't take this . You 've got to do something ! Look , I can change you , but I can 't change your past . Don 't tell me you didn 't know ! Here . Take this . I don 't need that shit anymore . Guards ! You need to be stabilized . It 's over , Thomas . I retire from my brief career as a rhesus monkey . Guards ! No ! You can 't do that ! No ? Just watch me . You 'll ruin the experiment . We haven 't finished yet ! What are you talking about , genius ? You wouldn 't have the balls to do it on yourself ! Get out of my life , you fucking parasite ! Without me , you 're already dead ! Let me go , you fuck ! I warn you , Nielsen . If you 've been testing something on this man . Your " protégé " will end up executed . What difference does it make ? - I 'll refer to the D.A. - Be my guest . Show Doctor Nielsen out . I know my way . It 's late . You should go home . No , it 's ok . I can finish this up tonight . No , seriously , it 's late . You should go . Ok . By the way , for your extra time ... I 'm trying to get you some money - and I think we 'll be able to ... - Are you kidding ? Becoming your assistant is a promotion , man . My mum told everybody in the neighborhood ! You 're staying here tonight ? Yeah , I 'm afraid so ... Well , there 's a spare T shirt in my locker , so ... What would I do without you ? You 'd become a bum . See you tomorrow . Confidential communication . Beginning of cranial injection of an " Activator " on Subject A. Species Guinea Pig . Destruction of Serotonin receptor 5-HT 1 Beta on its way . " Activator " has been loaded with compatible " RNA messenger " from gene 6 Q 13 . This experiment will be our reference . Beginning of Phase II on " Subject B " . Species Human . Gender Male . Age Twenty seven . No previous record of violent behavior ... I can 't think of a better way to show of my faith in my research . Behavioral alterations should begin in the next 72 hours . Yes . Thank you . I 'll get a ride . Aren 't you starving ? Luckily , I loaded the fridge yesterday . Were you expecting someone ? Yes ... you . You should see a mother wolf with her cubs . First , she digs a nest , I mean you know , she wouldn 't leave them alone for a moment . How can you deny the nature can be loving ? Survival instinct . She needs her progeny to pass on her genes . Well , you 're certainly not a sentimentalist . I used to be one . What made you change ? In two thousand years of so called civilization , do you know how many years of war we 've known for every year of peace ? You don 't like to talk about yourself , do you ? Thirteen . Thirteen years of war for every year of peace , resulting in two and a half billion dead , for nothing . Or for a great cause . A great cause everybody forgot . The problem is our very nature . And you geneticists will decide for all of us . If we don 't accept to change ourselves , nothing will . Well , don 't change everything , hey ? Stop it , Justine stop it ... Give it to me . What 's the rush ? It 's the lab . Something I forgot . Let 's have dinner . I 'll pick you up in a couple of hours . Confidential communication . 55 A 79 . - Beginning of cranial injection ... - Rule number one ... " A code should not have anything to do with your life " . - Guinea Pig . Gender male . Age 3 months . - " Maria " , your sister 's name . - Destruction of Serotonin receptor ... - That was an easy guess . By the way , how is she doing ? I 'm impressed . This is Nobel Prize material . Or justice . Depending . On what ? 50-50 split seems reasonable , doesn 't it ? What do you say ? You mean you have no intention of turning me in ? What for ? My interest is for you to take all of the risks and for us to share all the profits and the glory . Okay , take your time . You call me tomorrow . Just tell me , though , I 'm curious ... How does it feel ? I mean , given your present state , - I just wonder ... - Given my present state ... I should not be provoked . Thomas ! Open the gate now ! Open it ! Open it , quickly ! Now ! Come on ! Move ! Come on the code , Jesus the code ! The code come on Thomas ! I mean it , now ! Think ! Jesus Christ ! Please , Thomas , Come on ! No , Jesus , Thomas wake up , tell me the code . Redial Thomas Nielsen . Hi , this is Thomas Nielsen . I can 't take your call right now . Please leave a message . Okay , guys ... I 'm here , calm down . Hey you , didn 't you eat last night ? You know what 's your problem ? You 're too high maintenance , yeah ! You remind me of an ex girlfriend ... .. at the department of molecular biology where Doctor Sebastian Delnick was found dead , savaged by laboratory dogs . The dogs belonged to Doctor Nielsen ... The pit bulls were bred in order to obtain the most aggressive strain ... Both the Dean and Doctor Nielsen were unavailable for comment . Thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven . Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses , as we have forgive them that trespass against us ... Lead us not into temptation - but deliver us from evil ... - ... deliver us from evil ... For Thine is the Kingdom , the power and the glory forever and ever ... Amen . Sebastian Delnick would ask us to continue our mission . He would want us to move on . And this is why I have asked Doctor Thomas Nielsen to accept ... the position that I previously granted to our beloved Sebastian ... And I know Sebastian would approve the choice . I truly hope that you will all do your best to assist him in his new task . I am confident that Doctor Nielsen , despite his young age , is the right choice for the department . Justine ? We have to talk . About the other night . I don 't think this is the right moment , you know . Would you please just talk to me ? Listen , about the other night ... Yes ? I was working on something . I tried you at the lab . You weren 't there . Had you been there , poor Sebastian might still be alive . Look , I don 't care about the other night . I just don 't think there 's room enough for me in your life right now . That 's not true I can change . Have you ever heard the expression . " People don 't change , they just become more and more like themselves " . Wait ! What 's in these ? They need to go on that counter . Don 't switch that on until we find out which temperature it needs to be set up . What the hell , you think you are doing ? Well , I thought ... You thought ? Who asked you to think ? That goes over there , I told you . We are considered " heretics " , because we do not accept human nature as it is ! Nietzsche wasn 't wrong when he wrote that " For scientists , moral issues are often a " poison " . That " poison " neutralizes our most daring ambitions , our best energies . Those doubts stop us from moving forward . We are left with one solution , only one ... Free ourselves from these doubts and complete our mission ... improve the human species , make it stronger , better adapted , more competent and healthier ... We geneticists will provide those equal opportunities that politicians have been promising us all these years , and have failed to deliver ! - Where are you going ? - Home . You 're mad at me . Yeah , and I 'm not the only one . We preferred the former Thomas better . We thought he was special . I would never have thought you would have taken that path . Sorry but I cannot follow you . It 's amazing how wrong people can be . No hard feelings , man ... Access , please ? Ground level . Good night , Doctor . Happy New Year ! I wish we 'd met ages ago ... You could have saved me , from all that death ... Reactivity of human subject is getting out of control . Beginning of reverting procedure of Phase II in order to get back to normal . It is clear I cannot proceed any further without putting others in danger . Listening ... Thomas ? It 's me ! Justine ? How do I get in ? I guess I just can 't help myself . Better and better ... What 's the matter with you ? It 's not like I 'm comparing you to another man ! Listen , I have to set our wolf free in the morning . - Do you want to come ? - No . It 's not that terrible , two days in the mountains with me ? I 'm kind of in the middle of something here . Look , I 'm not going to be around forever , you know . You should make up you mind ... I 'll pick you up at dawn . " Neutralizer " 5 D should be ready in exactly ... forty hours . Command , count down . What 's that ? It 's so he won 't pick up your scent . Here . Go on , boy ... Let 's follow him . Where is he ? I can 't see him . There . He 's hiding behind the black rock . How can you see that ? I think this time , he 's really gone . My sister came out to visit for a few days . This was in Mongolia , with my Chinese assistant , we stayed up all night in this minuscule observation hut , trying to see a mating session . Wolves are very shy , very hard to catch at it . We stayed up for hours , in minus twenty . With only our sleeping bags , freezing ... And ? What ? What happened ? What do you think happened ? You 're going to pay for this . Promises , promises ... Thomas ? Thomas ! I 'm okay . Hundred and eighty is never " okay " , you know that . How long have you been in this state ? Don 't know ... We have to get you back down in the valley . Thomas , you 've got to stop ! It 's not what you think . Whatever it is you 're taking is killing you . It 's not what you think . What is it then ? Still no " trace " of " The Hunter " as the whole country gets ready to celebrate New Year 's Eve " " Police forces are combing the city area , where the murderer could have found refuge ... " What 's going on ? Thomas , what 's happening ? Thomas ? Wait ! Thomas ! Where are we going ? You 're not gonna drive in this ... Thomas ! Wait ! Thomas ! Wait ! It 's raining ! Turn on the windscreen wipers . Thomas , the wipers ! What ? Thomas ! Your headlights ! Thomas , your headlights ! - Slow down ! - No ! - Slow down ! - Shut up ! Stop the car ! - Is there any chance I can get a lift ? - Justine ? This guy is crazy . Get back in the car ! Thomas , look , I 'm going back to the field station . Get back in the fucking car ! - Hey , you ! The lady says no ... - Keep the fuck out of this ! Thomas , look ! Thomas , no ! I prefer to go back with him , okay ? I 'm serious , I gonna go back with him . Sorry , I just don 't understand you anymore . I need to see you . I should be crossing the border , but I thought ... " Hey , Let 's wish the doctor Happy New Year " . Where are you ? Listen to this . The night fair . Aren 't you nostalgic ? Of the innocence ... of the unspoilt feelings . Just wait for me , will you ? Of course I will . How will I find you ? How could you not ? So good ... I want to fulfill all of your fantasies ... I imagine you inside me ... I 'm thinking of you every night , thinking of your mouth on me , of your hands on me . There you are , my man ! Mister Hunter , kill me so softly ... You 're so sexy Hunter . Are you there ? I 'm here , I 'm here . The injection , did you do it ? Are you worried about my health ? I had to try the reverse experiment on myself . Bullshit . The truth is you could not fight your own nature . The truth is you were bored with yourself . What 's the gun for ? I don 't know who I 'm talking to . Nor do I. You 're alright ? No , no ... wait , wait , I 'm not gonna hurt you , I 'm not gonna hurt you ! Wait , wait , wait ! Help ! It 's the Hunter , it 's the Hunter , stop him . It 's the Hunter stop him ! Thank you . Shut up ! How did you find me ? Easy . It 's New Year 's , and you 've never known how to have fun . Guess what happened tonight ? I saw plenty of sexy girls ... without feeling like I want to cut them into pieces . And you 've defied the cops just to tell me that ? And for this . We 're compatible , remember ? I 'm afraid it 's too late . You know what ? You were right . Being bad is rewarding . I have a devoted lab team now , big contracts , and women ... they seem to think I am the sexiest thing on earth . Was I such an ego maniac when I was bad ? Don 't you get fed up with playing God ? What I get fed up with is man 's arrogance . We overestimate ourselves , thinking we 're better than animals . So , wasn 't all this for Maria ? How do you know about my sister ? It took me a while to make the connection . Too many of them , I guess . There 's one thing I could never understand . Why did you spare her ? I wish I could tell you it was mercy , God I wish I could . I actually thought ... what good is a body of work if there 's nobody alive to talk about your genius ? - Why did you spare me ? - I didn 't . " The Hunter " is dead , isn 't he ? They 'll go easy on you . You can always tell them . I did it for man kind . You 're so amazing , you good guys . You always know what to do . Me , I don 't have a clue . Hi , this is Thomas Nielsen . I can 't take your call right now . Please leave a message . It 's Maria , again . Please call me back , Thomas . I 'm starting to worry . The Hunter is still on the loose . Earlier this evening , he managed to escape the police at the downtown night fair . I can 't take your call right now . Please leave a message . " Command Music . Richard Strauss , third lieder . I remember that girl . Dancing like an angel . I was hiding in the dark basement . She didn 't know it , but she was dancing for me . I wanted her to see me . Maybe to love me . But instead ... No ... Don 't be afraid , I wouldn 't hurt you now . Your brother made sure I wouldn 't . Where is he ? He is in danger . What kind of danger ? He 'll tell you . No ... No don 't ... Don 't . You must hate me . Not anymore . You should , you should hate me . Please say it ... say you hate me . Have mercy , say it ! I can 't . What is it ? Here , take this . I don 't need it where I 'm going . But your brother does . Where are you going ? Can I have this ? The little dancer ? Yes , but ... Wait ! Get back inside , It 's getting cold . Goodbye , Maria . Hi , it 's me . Look , give us a call when you get this , Ok ? Sounds crazy , but ... I miss you already . Look , drive carefully , alright ? Bye . Hi , Justine . Did I scare you ? Sorry ... Am I interrupting ? Who was that ? What ? That guy on the phone . It wasn 't a guy on the phone , that was you ... Stop lying to me ! I saw him leaving ! We had a coffee ! He was kind enough to bring me all ... Why are you lying to me ? Tell me what happened ? He brought me home , for Christ sake , Thomas , this is ridiculous ! What 's happening ? What 's wrong with you ? What 's wrong with you ? You and all those men in your life ! Sebastian , the truck driver ... Who 's next ? God , you ... You 're becoming so territorial , like an animal . My God ! Justine ! Justine ! Where are you ? Justine ! Where do you think you 're going ? Don 't you understand ? I hate it when you look at another man , when you talk to another man , when you touch another man ... Listen to me ! I want you for myself . I 'm in love with you . What 's wrong with that ? Give me the keys , give me the keys ! Don 't make me hurt you ! There is still time to change your mind . My research would be lost . I have friends on the other side of the boarder . All I need is a lab . Nurse , Can you help me to check ? I have got a pregnant woman hemorrhaging and I need some " O negative " quick ! Yes . He 's O negative . He was found at the border . A car crashed . We sedated him . Can you transfuse him without risks ? I think so . Have you checked his blood yet ? Yes , it 's clean . You missed me , didn 't you ? I missed you too . Dear Justine , I 'm trying to get back to being the man you met . I don 't know exactly how long this will take . But I hope you 'll be there . This is not what I meant . And my experiment might not be the way to do it . But I still believe that if we don 't change ourselves , nothing will . Right now , I don 't know exactly who I am . But then again , who does ?

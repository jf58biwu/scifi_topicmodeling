 200 bucks missing from my wallet . - Owen ? - No elves . I saw him about an hour ago . He was flying . - On what ? - Meth . I 'm ... I 'm sick , man ... - I want to get better . - Okay , so here 's what 's going down . You 're going to enroll in a program that 's going to get you off the drugs . You 're going to get a job and you 're going to live your life like ... You know , a relatively normal human being . The increase in suicides started in New Orleans , then spread up through here , and as high as Arkansas . - Suicides don 't spread . - The results are the same across all demographics . Even kids . I found a phorbol . I found it in all the samples of the suicide victims . Brains and all the other organs . Fuck ! P.K.C. - Phorbols don 't occur naturally in humans . - So where did they come from ? We have no idea . And there 's something else . This is a new one . It 's never been seen before . This chick called last night , said , uh ... Harlan died . They had a lawyer from the company come over here last night asking for ... Harlan 's laptop and all of his files . I think Harlan left us something . Actually I think these genes have something to do with sexual reproduction . Well , according to these labels , they 're all boys . So does the world really need a cure for homosexuality ? Is it a disease ? Lowy have filed an injunction that we , NorBAC , are not releasing research that belongs to them . Where is it ? No one has any idea what happened to it . Thank you , sir . David and Carlos left for Arkansas this morning . Yes , they 're on the suicides . What ? Where are you hearing this ? No ! If somebody is telling you I 'm not responding to a court order , I want you to know that 's bullshit . Yes , the research is still missing . Come up here for what ? I 'll have something for you by the end of the week . Yeah , you have a great day too . Wes ! I don 't want excuses . I don 't want theories . I want to know what happened to that research . I think we should sit down and talk to David . I think that Connor McGuinn would like that . I just wanted to let you know that Carlos - and David made it to Arkansas . - Thank you , Mayko . Wes . You need to find Harlan Sendack 's research- - I could find it , if you were here . But I think your senior scientist- - Because that 's your job . And McGuinn is my job . - You got that ? - Yes ! 2.10 - The Wild Innocent The State beverage is milk , the State bird is the mockingbird , the flower is the apple blossom , and Arkansas ' dance is the square dance . Doing some heavy reading ? No . I had dinner with Bob last night . So what time is your appointment with the Mayor ? He 's dedicated his entire day to me . He says he 's excited to have a " hot shot " scientist looking into this . How many patients you looking at today ? Five , I think . Unless another one walked off the deep end since yesterday . Nice welcoming committee . Let 's see if we can find out why . From New Orleans , all the way up the Mississippi to Greanville there 's been a 50 % increase in suicides . How many people are we talking about ? Almost 2,000 over the last year . Well , all I know is it 's tearing this place apart . I understand you 've had six suicides so far . Well , six officially , but I 'm saying seven . Milton Butterworth ... he has a place out there next to mine . His little daughter , Sarah , found him in the corn crib , busted neck . The Medical Examiner ruled accidental , but Milt was all torn up inside for the last month or two . Torn up how ? Just moping ' around . Couldn 't seem to get himself going . I 've talked to him but he just couldn 't say what it was . - And the other six ? - Oh , I knew ' em all real well . There 's the Arnolds ' boy , and ... the Nelsons ' little girl , Katy . Goddamn it . That was a hard one . She 's just ten years old and she took her daddy 's hunting rifle . Look , I can get you the autopsy reports on all the others if that 'll help . - Everything 'll help . - Where do you want to start ? I need to get samples . Water . Soil . Air . And I 'm going to need to see where these people lived . Not a problem . - Listen , Mayor ... - Oh , Ed . - Please . Mayor 's not a paying ' job . - Okay , Ed . What do you think is going on around here ? What do I think ? Well , Doc , I 'll tell you . This is the Middle America . Folks around here don 't get the big city blues . We worry about the price of corn , not terrorist attacks . But I 've got to tell you that there 's been a lot of talk about something like that happening around here . - Terrorism ? - Isn 't that why you 're here ? Isn 't that what you people deal with up there - in that hot shot biological lab of yours ? - Sometimes . So what do you think ? You got a notion of what it is ? We think it has something to do with these things called phorbols . They 're plant esters . We use them all the time in the lab as experimental tumor promoters . They act by directly stimulating that protein kinase C , by bypassing its normal calcium- - - Oh , I had to ask . - Sorry , my point is they 're not supposed to be in us , and that 's where we 're finding them . All right , we got all day and I 'm all ears . Lead on . Nice welcoming committee . Let 's see if we can find out why . Hello ... My name is Dr. Carlos Serrano . I 'm here to help you . I 'd like to check things out . Can you open your mouth for me ? Your tongue is still there . Can 't talk ? Can you tell me how you feel ? Like I want to go to bed and sleep forever . You look sad . How sad ? I can 't , uh ... From a scale of one to ten , ten being the saddest . About a thousand . I just want it to go away . I want ... I want to make it go away . Gotta give you credit , Doc . You are one thorough son-of-a-gun . Yeah , well , that 's what science is all about . Looking at every little detail , and putting all the pieces of the puzzle together . - You think the water might be poisoned ? - Could be . - You think that 's what killed the deer ? - What deer ? Aah , shit ! One of them details you might have missed . Yeah , thanks for pointing it out . Looks like it drowned Something dragged it out . Raccoons 'll do that . You get a lot of this down here ? Dead animals ? After a tough winter . Pheasant . Rabbits . Deer been on the rise . Too many of ' em . Overpopulated the area . Think that 's what 's making ' em so skittish . - Skittish ? - Oh , they been running around . Mike Davis runs the hardware store , found one in his pool the other day . Got a freezer full of venison out of it . - Suicidal animals ? - I know . I know . It 's out there . Animals don 't commit suicide . Neither did anybody else in this town for the last 30 years , so who 's to say that whatever 's cutting through here isn 't affecting the animal population as well ? - It 's possible . - Yeah . You know , a virus or a bacteria in the deer or whatever the fuck they hunt for down here . Maybe that 's how the victims got the phorbols into their system . Well , it 's certainly worth a look . - How 'd you make out ? - No common links on the surface . I 'm hoping that the blood chemistry will tell us something . Oh , and that ambulance we saw this morning . - Yeah ? - It was another suicide . Oh shit . Well , Greanville ... it 's been depressing . Yeah . Yeah , we 're just getting back to the lab now . How ya doing ? - Good . - Where are you ? I 'm just at the center . I got out of this seriously intense counselling session . Oh yeah ? So , it 's good ? Yeah , totally good . Thanks , David . No man , you 're the one who 's doing it . Listen , you keep with this program , you stay clean and I 'll take you to Montreal for graduation . Good food . Beautiful women . Awesome . I gotta go . Oh , alright . Well ... I 'll see you later tonight . - David . - Oh , not now , Wes . I 'm busy . - I 'll see you up there . - I need to talk to you . The only thing I want to talk to you about is Harlan Sendak 's missing research . - I don 't know where it is . - Yeah . That makes two of us . I 'll find it . Yeah , you get right on that , Wes . One question . Why was the research in the back of your car ? Like I said , Wes , I 'm busy . Don 't ever touch me again . David ! Welcome back . - I have some really good news . - I want you guys to drop everything and take a look at this water sample every way you can . - Okay . - Viruses , bacteria , - toxins , anything that doesn 't belong . - Got it . I need some answers and get Bob on this too , today . - David . - Yeah , what ? Well , the needle in the haystack ? I found it . - You found the retrovirus ? - Yeah ! Check it against all the databases of viral genome sequences ? I did . No match . - It 's definitely an original . - And it 's definitely a retrovirus ? - Well what took you so long ? - Funny . All right , let 's keep this quiet . Do you know if this is in the Korean stem cell line or is it everywhere ? - Don 't know yet . - Okay , keep working . - Doctor . - Doctor . Okay , Jona ... I know you . - What ? - We met . No . Yeah . At the club , in the East Village . In New York ? No ! You must have been wasted . You 're insane . I 've never met you . - And you 're not from New York . - Hey . True shit . I got off at the wrong subway ... stop . Uh ... Where 'd you get the coffee ? There . - Where ? - Just over there ! - Over where ? - Oh my God ! Right where it says fucking coffee . - Can 't you read ? - No , I 'm ... - I 'm blind . - Great . Can you help me find it ? Please ? Ow ! My knee ! I did a comparative LC-MS report on the two brain samples you brought back . Both victims had phorbols . The samples were fresher , so I was able to detect higher levels . - What levels ? - MacDonald had 4.85 - and Deer had 6.7 . - You know that guy , Deer ? - Yeah . - Is a deer . - An animal deer ? - Yep . So the same phorbols that are causing suicide and depression in humans - are in the deer too ? - Maybe . Where are you at with that water sample ? Normal viruses and bacteria . Nothing out of the ordinary . - I 'll have a toxicology report in a little while . - Okay , good . Wait a minute . I thought you said phorbols - came from plants ? - Well , they do . Okay , what about the food source ? Well , it would have to be in plants that animals eat . Or breathe . Could it be in pollen ? We 'll make a scientist out of you yet . What about disease ? Yeah , it could be a disease we share with other mammals . Carlos , where are you at with those samples you brought back from Arkansas ? Running tests on blood tissue and urine . Well . We got our marching orders . Let 's go . Okay , so I 'm gonna have my own TV show . And it 's gonna start 5 minutes late because everybody 's 5 minutes late anyway , right ? Yeah , that 's cool . Okay , so it 's going to be a reality show about me meeting superstars . And then , like , the movie stars , they 're going to act like rock stars , and the rock stars they 're going to act like supermodels and the supermodels like movie stars . So , are we gonna smoke ? I have crystal . No ... I 'm clean these days . - Do you mind if I do ? - No , go ahead . There 's no connection whatsoever ... Okay , thanks , Paul . So there is nothing in the lungs of the dead or the patients that indicates pollen , other than what you 'd expect to find in a farming community . We 'll keep pursuing it , but plants seem unlikely . I just got a call from Paul Nixon down at the CDC . He says they got no record of diseases between humans and animals that involve phorbols . So ... I guess that leaves water . My show 's going to be called Ramona 's Revenge . - Oh , is that your name ? - Yeah . Yeah . - I 'm Owen . - Hey . So anyways ... In my show , right . I 'm going to come to your house , and I 'm going to make it uglier . And I 'm going to give people makeovers to what they really should look like . So assholes , they 're going to look like giant assholes , and bitches are going to look like big bitches . Do you think I 'm beautiful ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? Yeah . Beautiful enough to fuck me ? No , no . You 've got to do this . You 've got to do this . You 've got to do it . You 've got to do it . Do it . Fucking so beautiful . Fuck , I knew we 'd find something in the water . We 're not sure what kind of eggs but they 're definitely eggs . Cute little bastards , aren 't they ? Those are from the pond . But I also found them in the tap water sample from Greanville . Shit , so it 's in the water table . I 'm trying to grow the eggs . Not easy . I 'm sure Jill will give you a hand , won 't you , Jill ? You are , after all , the brilliant scientist who discovered a previously unknown retrovirus . Right you are . Very good . Good work , guys . PARASITE It 's gotta be . ² I gotta stay beautiful . You 're fucking crazy . What did you say ? You think I 'm crazy ? Ah ! I don 't give a fuck what you think , okay ? 'cause they 're the crazy ones ! I think I 'm gonna kill her . I think I 'm going to push her down the stairs . - Who ? - I 'm going to push ... my sister down the stairs . - What ? - My fucking therapist says the firstborns are supposed to be achievers , suckups ... and that the youngest is supposed to be the rebel , but ... My fucking sister stole my fucking job ! Ramona ! Come on . Come on , get up ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! You gotta walk around . You 've got to walk around ! Come on ! You 've got to walk around ! Come on ! Come on ! Ramona , you 've got to breathe ! You 've got to breathe ! Come on ! Wake up ! Breathe ! Come on ! - Sir , Caroline is up in her office . - Thank you . - Everything all right ? - Just fine . I know . I know . I ... I 've got to go , Audrey . Yeah , I appreciate your patience . You too . Bye . So you just couldn 't stay away . Audrey Graves ? Have you found that research ? Not yet . That 'll get you in anywhere you want to go . Even down to where we throw out the rat crap . If you find what you 're looking for , let me know . - You sound a little upset . - I am upset . Hey . I 'm just doing my job . Really ? Maybe someday you can tell me what that job is . I 'm not the enemy . He 's just over here . What kind of worms ? Yeah ? Well , look . Just send me everything you 've got . - Right . - David . Hang on . Not now , Wes . Sorry . - There 's somebody here you need to talk to . - Not now , Wes . - David . - Hang on . There 's a police officer who would like to speak to you . Jimmy , I 'm going to have to call you back . Hi . David Sandstrom . Monica Milovsky . Juvenile Task Force . Oh fuck . Owen . What did he do ? - You are his uncle , right ? - Is that what he said ? No . The kid 's just latched onto me . I don 't know why ... I 'm just trying to help him out . What happened ? According to Owen he was with a girl , 14 . Ramona Capobianco . They smoked crystal meth . She started to turn blue . He took a vehicle registered to you . Drove Ramona to hospital emergency . He panicked and left her on the sidewalk . He drove away and into a TTC bus . - He 's fine . - Good . The girl died . Oh . Let me get my coat . What 's the charge ? We 're asking for Criminal Negligence Causing Death . You know , he helped bust up this marijuana grow up in the subways of New York . It was making a lot of people really sick . I mean , is that going to count for anything ? - Is everything okay ? - I 'll talk to you later . It 's all right . - I fucked up . - No shit . I 'm sorry . I 'm not the one you need to say sorry to , Owen . I tried mouth-to-mouth . I got her to the hospital . You left her on the fucking sidewalk . Why didn 't you take her into emergency ? They could have saved her life , maybe . - She died in the car . - Oh , you 're a doctor , now ? I 've been there . She was dead . Did you give her the shit ? No . It was hers . I swear , David . Did you smoke it with her ? Yeah , I did . Fuck . Why , Owen ? Why ? You ever been there ? Where you can see everything so fucking ... intensely . And every fucking minute without it ... everything 's just nothing , you know and ... it 's not so hard to go there . Well that 's it . I 've got to call your parents . You can 't . You 're in jail , Owen . In a foreign country . With no passport . I 've got to call your parents . I don 't know where they are . My dad 's a drunk , my mom was , until she found Jesus , and now blames me for putting the fucking devil in her life . Spare me , all right ? My dad 's an asshole . I 'm an asshole , too . But at least I try to be a better asshole , okay ? It 's in our DNA to improve the species . So when you 're ready to join the rest of us ... I 've tried . I tried 50 fucking times . I 've been in plenty of drug programs . I was in a summer camp for 2 months . I was straight as a fucking line of coke . I got out and I cracked , okay ? I 'm ... My life 's fucked . It 's looking a lot brighter than Ramona 's . I 'm sorry . I am . I know she 's dead . I just met her . I was clean . I didn 't want to smoke that shit . - I fucked up . - Yeah , you did , Owen . You really did . I heard about the police . Is everything- - It 's fine , Bob . Don 't worry about it . How 's it going with the suicides ? Jill 's growing the eggs . - Hey . - Hey . I spoke with the medical examiners who did the postmortems . A lot of skepticism about the parasite theory . No one 's ever heard of a parasite that produces phorbols . Why don 't you quit ? Cigarettes . Ah , uh ... - Nobody likes a quitter . - Seriously . I 've tried quitting a hundred times . It 's an addiction . - You don 't have any addictions ? - Just booze , cigars , hockey and sex . - How long you been at it ? - Um ... since I 'm 14 . So you figure it 's pretty much part of your biochemistry now , eh ? Yeah ... I have an addiction to nicotine . But do you consider yourself an addict ? I suppose ... - Did your parents smoke ? - No , actually ... - David ! - Gotta go . - Hey . - Hi . Come on in . - Close the door . - Okay . - What 's up ? - Did you get my message ? About Owen ? Yeah . Shit . - Yeah . - He 's doing okay ? Well bail 's gonna be tough because he 's a pretty good candidate - for running away . - No kidding . The deal is if he doesn 't get bail , they could lock him up for two years before he gets a chance to go to trial . Might be good for him . Yeah , I hear there 's a lot of good role models in prison . It would be harsh , David , but he 'd get clean . I don 't want him going to jail ! Okay ? What did you want to see me about ? Genetics as a defence . - It isn 't . - No , work wh me here , okay . - You say you 're an addict , right ? - Yeah . What about your parents ? - They were both alcoholics . - Okay , so there you go . I mean , what about a genetic predisposition to addiction ? I mean , did you ever look into it for yourself ? You can 't cure him , David . - A genetic treatment is at least 10 years off . - Ah , okay . So you have looked into it . What 'd you find out ? - You 're opening a can of worms here . - That wasn 't my question . We 're not just genes ! Why don 't we let a judge decide that ? We 'd like an adjournment of 24 hours , as my client is undergoing medical testing . The Crown sees the request as reasonable . So does the judge . Let me see ... Tomorrow , 2 PM . I 'll see you all then . Court is adjourned . Owen , I want you to spit your gum into that . If this is a drug test , I 'm clean . Let 's let the judge decide . See you tomorrow . Okay , let 's go . Bob ! Bob . There are 36 genes linked to addictive personalities , right ? 38 , I believe as of the most recent analysis . Here 's Owen 's DNA . I want you to run it against them . See if you get any hits . Bob ... the eggs . Anything hatch yet ? - Nope , they 're still growing . - Okay . - Hi , Carlos . - Hi , Bob . After you do Owen 's , can you do mine ? Because if I don 't have addiction genes maybe then I can quit . That meth is carving a pathway through your veins trying to get to your brain . Look , I know I fucked up . All right , I will see your four dollars and then I will raise you ... - a hundred bucks . - You 're bluffing . - Try me . - I 'm out . He 's out . And he knows how to play . You guys should have seen Caroline and Wes arguing in her office . Man , she was mad and he wasn 't backing down . - About what ? - I don 't know . I did hear a mention of Connor McGuinn . That guy gives me the creeps . . I 'm out . - I thought I was bluffing ? You are , I just can 't afford to prove it . - Okay , me too . I fold . - You in , or you out , Bob ? - Owen 's test results from the lab . - Oh ! Good , I asked them to email them to you as soon as the analysis came in . Thanks , Bob . Holy shit ! 32 out of 38 gene samples match for addiction . Call . What are you holding , David ? - Pair of 2s . - I knew you were bluffing . Only at cards . - Pair of Jacks . - Nice ! Very good ! Outstanding ! Again ! - Who is CS ? - I asked Bob to test my genes as well . Well , my friend ... 6 out of 38 matches . Below average . Well , I just quit smoking ! - Attaboy ! - Outstanding . I don 't believe it . I checked with the parasitology guys . Nobody 's ever seen this before . We find these guys in the humans or the deer ? Nothing yet . No eggs either . The worms produce phorbols ? David , it doesn 't matter . We still haven 't found the worms in any of the victims . In any of the dead victims . In the dead . We need to look for these guys in the living . David , another victim . A little girl , twelve , about fifteen miles north of Greanville . - So it 's spreading . - What is ? Parasitic worms . - We think . - In the goddamn water . There may be a connection with the suicides . Do we know how the worms got in the water ? First case of suicide , associated with depression was about 20 kilometres up the Mississippi from New Orleans around the same time Hurricane Katrina made landfall . That 's probably it , it blew in on the tail of a hurricane . - From where ? - We got plenty of time to figure that out . Right now we have to confirm that this is the parasite . So Bob , get to work on the worm , find out if it produces phorbols . - I 'll get on the worms . - Okay , Carlos , go back to Greanville . See if you can find worms in the ... depressed people . And Jill , I want you to turn these worms inside out . Find out what they eat , what they shit ... - What their favorite TV show is . - Where are you going ? Court . Court ? Owen is a kid who has a history of drug and alcohol abuse . But so do his parents . And the relevance of that is that recent research is building a very strong argument to suggest the connection between addiction and genetics . There are 38 genes that we know of right now associated with addictive behavior . In an average person , about 30 of those would be normal , or the yellow dots . Maybe a few red dots , which could suggest addictive traits . For example , let 's say you had a gene that gave you low levels of adrenalin . Well , your body craves a certain amount of adrenalin , so anybody who had that gene might become a thrill-seeker . Or let 's say you had a gene that made you very easily stressed out . That could lead to addictive behavior , because you might take up smoking . Or if you had a gene that gave you low serotonin . Well , drugs actually raise your serotonin levels ... So ... or you could ... No , okay ... The theory is that if you have enough of these genes lined up you 're more likely to become an addict . - Okay . - Okay . - And Owen has ... ? - Oh ! This is Owen . 32 out of 38 . 32 out of 38 , how unusual is that ? The average person could pretty easily overcome eight red dots . So 32 would be like drawing 4 aces 4 times in a row . I mean , in my opinion , Owen had a genetic destiny to become an addict . His ... his free will barely had a chance . Thank you . I won 't argue the science , though it is new and experimental . I 'm more concerned about the legal ramifications . I understand . If we don 't punish him ? What 's going to stop him from re-offending ? Yeah , but putting him in a juvenile detention centre for 2 years is like putting him in a criminal school . Are you an expert on criminology ? No ... Where should we put him then ? That 's what I 'm saying . AA or ... counselling centres . I mean , these are all great ideas , but if ... - If addiction is in the genes ... - That wouldn 't help ? No . If you had genes telling you that you had red hair and then you went and dyed it black . - Your hair would be red . - Exactly . Owen is , what you might call , a classic case of genetic predisposition . Wouldn 't it be better to put him in a hospital ? And check his genetic coding ? Study it . Find a way to help him , instead of just throwing him away . Court is adjourned while I consider your arguments . There . I was able to collect some of that liquid . Trace of phorbols , David . Good work , Bob . - Jill helped too . - Fuck ! Fucking shit ! Bob wait ! - What is that ? - David ? What is it ? Concentrated retrovirus in medium . - Shower now . - Fuck ! I don 't know what happened . It just blew up . Let 's get you to the hospital and have you checked out . The chances of getting infected- - It 's listed as Full Precaution . You know that . Yeah , for viruses like Ebola . Look , you 've sequenced the retrovirus but you don 't know if it can give you a headache or some kind of new immunodeficiency . It looks like the vortex might have been off kilter . What ? That 's bullshit . That doesn 't just happen . Jill , let 's just ... get you to the hospital . How are you feeling today , Jackson ? Have you ever had an ultrasound ? Just relax . This is called a transducer and what it does , is it transmits an image to the screen of what 's going on inside . Let 's see ... Clear image now . - It 's okay , sit back down . - That 's in me ? ! Jackson , sit down please . Lie back . Just relax . It 's going to be fine . Okay ? So far her health is excellent and the doctors think ... Yeah , yeah , yeah . What about your investigation ? My conclusion is that the accident was caused by her negligence . Oh , bullshit ! You 're supposed to check the vortex before you use it . Whatever . What caused the malfunction , Wes ? - We 're working on it . - Swell . I feel so much better now . Thank you , Wes . What the fuck is going on around here , Caroline ? I don 't know . You don 't know or you 're not going to tell me ? I don 't know , David . I don 't know . Yeah . Research doesn 't just vanish and Jill doesn 't just fuck up . Hello ... David , you said you wanted the news right away . Well , we have it . About the parasites you brought back ? The mature worms release about 3 micrograms of phorbols per hour . The boy I examined : 62 worms . - Jesus . - That 's 4.464 milligrams per day . Enough to raise your PKC , so you 're suicidally depressed . - Where are the worms coming from ? - They lay their eggs in the water . - That 's where their life cycle begins . - Exactly . They 're mimicking Nematomorph hairworms . What ? Oh . I just finished reading about them . They 're these creepy little bastards . See , they develop in grasshoppers until they need to reproduce . And then they brainwash the grasshopper host by releasing all these proteins . The proteins tell the grasshopper to jump in the water . It does and drowns . Okay , so they need to get to the water to breed . - Yes ! - See , the worms are inside you . But they need to get out and spread to other people in order to avoid extinction . So they make you confused and depressed until you take your own life . Then they get out . They mate . They lay eggs in the water and they wait for the next victim to come along and drink up the eggs . We think that the human brain cannot be as easily controlled as smaller animals , that 's why all of our victims did not end up in the water . Can we treat it ? Kill the parasite ? There can be up to a hundred different parasites living in the human body . A roundworm is quite common . It can lay up to 200,000 eggs a day . Hookworm larvae go through the skin . Pinworm can infect one in five children- - Okay Bob , your point is ? They 're all treatable as long as you know they 're there . In other words . Yeah , we have a chance . Okay , I 'll alert the Governor of Arkansas . You better alert the governor of Missouri , Iowa and Illinois while you 're at it . We don 't know how far this has spread up the Mississippi . Guys ... Good work . Whenever you want to talk . Come in . - Hi . - Caroline . Honey , you don 't really need the mask . I mean , I 've been working with the retrovirus for over a month . If it were contagious , it won 't be airborne . I knew that , I did . It 's nice of you to come down . - So , what brings you here ? - Oh ... This . Organic dark chocolate . I love dark chocolate . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . They 're saying a week quarantine . Oh . It 's a waste of time , man . I 'm not going to get it . Let 's hope not . But we have to watch and see what develops . Okay . What do you think happened with that equipment ? - I don 't know . - Wes said it was loose . No . It 's not possible . Jona checks it at least once a week . Okay , well ... tell me everything there is to know about your retrovirus . Everything . The widening gap between the enshrined rules of law and the evolutionary rules of science is something that 's always bothered me . I recently read that the teenage brain isn 't even fully formed . So how are they supposed to make complex moral decisions ? Owen , you are a citizen of another country . And we share with that country a border that is 5,000 kilometres long . That 's 3,000 miles . And if you disappear , Owen , Dr. Sandstrom 's important argument won 't be heard in court . So I have decided that I 'm going to deny your motion of bail , in order that science will have its day in court . You 're amended to the custody of the youth justice services of this province . Thank you . Hang on a sec . Hang on a sec . Owen ... I 'm sorry . Me too . I keep seeing her . That ... that ... That stuff you were saying , about my genes , can you fix it ? In ten years . Maybe . Just a second . Just a second . - That 's a fucking long time . - Yeah . Well , at least I 'm not a complete fuckup . I mean ... - Some of it was how I was born . - Sure , and how you were raised and ... And some of it is me . Whichever part wins is ... up to you . - Yeah . - And you 're not alone . You need anything , you call me . Thanks , Doc . See ya . What ? David ? Dad . You 're all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . - Where are you ? David ... I got a problem . Dans le prochain épisode : * You could have been killed in that fire . Yes . And for that one mistake , I will die here . - Surrounded by ugliness . - Oh ... Jesus . You don 't even know the effects of GMO foods on the average person . GMOs are here to stay , they 're the future .

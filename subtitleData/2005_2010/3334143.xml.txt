 Hello Hurley . Frogurt . It 's Neil . Neil . What are you doing in Rose and Bernard 's tent , Hurley ? Nothing . Nothing , huh ? Looks to me like you snagged some DHARMA cabernet . Bernard said I could borrow it . No worries , bro . I 'm not here to get up in your scene . If you wanna steal from Bernie , steal from Bernie . I just have a question for you . What 's going on with you and Libby ? What do you mean ? I mean are you going to make a move or not ? None of your business , dude . Look tubby , you 're holding up the line . You and I both know you 're not going to get past doing laundry with her so how about you back off , and let a real man show her what 's what . - Really ? - Really . Well it just so happens I 'm way past laundry . Yeah that 's right . In fact , I 've got a date with Libby right now . We 're going on a picnic . You got a date with her ? Yeah . I 'm bringing the wine , she 's bringing the blankets . Well played , Hurley . Well played . But this isn 't over . If you can 't close with sweet Libby , it 's Neil time - now and forever .

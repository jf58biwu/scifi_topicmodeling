A DOZEN TIMES , TWO DOZEN ? AT LEAST . AND THESE WORLDS , THEY ALWAYS FEEL REAL . EXCEPT THIS TIME , A GIRL WITHOUT A FACE APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE . IT FELT MORE LIKE A NIGHTMARE . BUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN SOONER OR LATER . I BUILD THESE WORLDS OUT OF OUR MEMORIES , I GUESS THIS TIME I DREDGED UP SOMETHING INCOMPLETE . A FRAGMENT OF SOMETHING , A SORT OF MENTAL HICCUP . OKAY , BUT THIS GIRL , IS SHE PART OF MY MEMORY OR YOURS ? YOURS , MINE , BOTH ... THERE 'S NO WAY TO KNOW , IS THERE ? ONE OF US MIGHT HAVE SEEN HER PICTURE IN A BOOK . OR SEEN HER IN THE STREET . WE JUST DON 'T REMEMBER HER FACE . IT MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN A GLIMPSE . A GLIMPSE PRETTY MUCH RUINED OUR NIGHT . WELL , TOMORROW NIGHT WILL BE BETTER , I PROMISE . ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO GO , ANYWHERE WE WANT TO GO , AND ANYTHING WE WANT TO DO . [ CHUCKLES ] YOU KNOW , FOR HIS 12th BIRTHDAY , I TOOK KYLE FISHING UP AT THE DOSEWALLIPS RIVER . I THOUGHT MAYBE THE THREE OF US COULD GO THERE . THAT SOUNDS GREAT . AND MAYBE THIS TIME , WE COULD ACTUALLY CATCH SOME FISH . OKAY . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT 'S WRONG WITH MY BEDROOM ... OR YOURS FOR THAT MATTER . [ ISABELLE MOANS ] WE 'VE ALREADY DONE IT THERE A BUNCH OF TIMES . EXPERTS SAY YOU SHOULD DO ADVENTUROUS THINGS TO KEEP RELATIONSHIPS MORE INTERESTING . THEY SAY THAT , HUH ? MM-HMM . WHAT COULD BE MORE ADVENTUROUS THAN A QUICKIE ON THE STAIRCASE ? DID YOU SWITCH FROM ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA TO COSMO MAGAZINE OR SOMETHING ? WELL , I READ LOTS OF STUFF . UH ... I 'LL TAKE THE ELEVATOR . DEVON ... HOW EMBARRASSING FOR HER . ISABELLE , JUST STOP . JUST ... [ SIGHS ] WHAT 'S THE MATTER , SHAWN ? WHAT 'S WRONG ? SHE 'S NOT GOING TO TELL MY FATHER . SHE 'D BE TOO AFRAID OF ME . ISABELLE , SHE 'S GOING TO TELL SOMEONE , AND THEY 'LL TELL SOMEONE ELSE , AND THEN EVERYBODY 'S GOING TO KNOW . [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ] WHERE 'S YOUR PARTNER ? LATE . A 4400 , CHRISTOPHER DUBOV , I WANT TO KNOW IF WE 'RE LOOKING AT A HATE CRIME . IT SAYS HERE HE 'S A LAWYER AT TELLER AND DUTCH . THAT 'S A MAJOR MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS FIRM . THEY 'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE FINANCIAL PAGES THIS YEAR . YEAH , WHICH MAKES HIM A HIGH-PROFILE 4400 . AN EASY TARGET FOR SOMEBODY LOOKING TO MAKE A POINT . HIS 4400 STATUS ISN 'T THE ONLY MOTIVE SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE TO ATTACK HIM . JUST TALK TO HIM . SEE IF HE CAN WRITE YOU UP A LIST . OH ... ALARM CLOCK NEED NEW BATTERIES ? NO , IT 'S A CRAPPY MORNING . YOU OPENING UP A NEWSSTAND ? NO , JUST A ... PROJECT I 'M WORKING ON . SO , WHAT DO WE GOT ? YEAH , YOU COULD CALL IT A HATE CRIME . MY SON MICHAEL CERTAINLY HATES ME . YOUR SON DID THIS TO YOU , MR. DUBOV ? HIS MOM AND I SPLIT UP . HE BLAMES ME . I 'M THE ONE WHO INTRODUCED HER TO BOB , HER NEW HUSBAND . I KNEW THEY BELONGED TOGETHER . I COULD SMELL IT . I 'M NOT SURE I FOLLOW . IT 'S MY ABILITY . IT SHOWED UP ONCE I STOPPED TAKING THE PROMICIN INHIBITOR . I CAN SMELL PHEROMONES . YOU MEAN THE STUFF PEOPLE PUT OUT TO ATTRACT OTHER PEOPLE ? WEIRD , HUH ? THINGS BETWEEN MY WIFE AND I HAVEN 'T BEEN TOO GOOD FOR A WHILE . THEN I MET BOB . HE 'S MY NEW DENTIST . RIGHT AWAY , THERE WAS SOMETHING FAMILIAR ABOUT HIM . THEN I REALIZED WHAT IT WAS . HE SMELLED JUST LIKE CAROLINE . SO I MADE HER AN APPOINTMENT . I HAD TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY BELONGED TOGETHER . LET ME GUESS- - LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT . SIGHT , SMELL , WHATEVER . YOU AND YOUR SON LOOK VERY HAPPY TOGETHER . THOSE WERE TAKEN WHEN MICHAEL WAS 10 . 10 ... THAT 'S A ... THAT 'S A GREAT AGE . MR. DUBOV ... DO YOU WANT US TO TALK TO MICHAEL ? ASSAULT IS A SERIOUS CRIME ? FORGET IT . I 'M SORRY MY SECRETARY CALLED YOU . BESIDES , I THINK I KNOW A WAY TO GET HIM TO FORGIVE ME . THERE 'S A NEW BAR AROUND THE CORNER . ONE OF THE WAITRESSES , SHE SMELLS JUST LIKE MY KID . LET 'S HOPE SHE 'S NOT MARRIED . AMEN TO THAT . YOU KNOW , I BET IF THAT GUY QUIT HIS JOB AND OPENED UP A DATING SERVICE , HE 'D MAKE A FORTUNE . THOUGH I 'M NOT SURE HOW TURNING A CORPORATE LAWYER INTO CUPID IS GOING TO HELP SAVE THE FUTURE . HEY ... HONEY , WHAT 'S GOING ON ? [ SOBS ] YOU ALL RIGHT ? DUBOV WAS GONE FOR , LIKE , FIVE YEARS , RIGHT ? I ... I BET HIS SON REALLY MISSED HIM . PROBABLY . I MEAN , EVERY 4400 LEFT SOMEONE BEHIND . ARE YOU SURE IT 'S NOT SOMETHING ELSE ? NO ... IT 'S FINE , REALLY . IT 'LL PASS . OKAY ... PHYSICAL ... YOU AND ISABELLE . YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THAT ? I ASKED YOU A QUESTION ! WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON BETWEEN YOU AND MY DAUGHTER ? WE NEVER PLANNED ON GOING BEHIND YOUR BACK . IN FACT , WE NEVER PLANNED IT AT ALL . IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED . FRIENDSHIP ! REMEMBER , WE TALKED ABOUT THAT . THAT 'S AS FAR AS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY I 'M SORRY . I 'M SORRY , TOO . I 'M SORRY I EVER TRUSTED YOU . ISABELLE IS JUST A CHILD- - NO , RICHARD , SHE ISN 'T . SHE 'S EMOTIONALLY IMMATURE , AND YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT ! THAT 'S WHAT YOU THINK ? YOU KNOW ME BETTER THAN THAT . THAT 'S NOT FAIR . I 'M NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT PROMISE TO YOU . I AM NOT GIVING YOU A CHOICE HERE , YOU UNDERSTAND ME ? THIS THING BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU , IT IS OVER . [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] I DON 'T RECALL SAYING " COME IN . " I THOUGHT PERHAPS A REFEREE MIGHT BE IN ORDER . MAY I ADVISE YOU GENTLEMEN TO GO TO YOUR NEUTRAL CORNERS ? THIS IS A PRIVATE CONVERSATION , MATTHEW . IT MAY HAVE STARTED OUT THAT WAY , BUT I ASSURE YOU , IT 'S BECOMING VERY PUBLIC . I COULD HEAR YOU OUT IN THE HALLWAY , AND FOR THE RECORD , I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH RICHARD . THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ISABELLE IS ILL-ADVISED AT BEST . I THOUGHT REFEREES DIDN 'T TAKE SIDES . IF I WERE YOU , SHAWN , I 'D TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A GRACEFUL EXIT . THINK ABOUT WHAT I SAID , SHAWN . I 'M EXPECTING YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING . WHAT 'S FOR LUNCH ? [ LAUGHS ] PROSCIUTTO WITH FIGS . ROSEMARY CHICKEN , COUSCOUS , AND RASPBERRIES . WOW . YOU KNOW , WHEN KYLE AND I USED TO GO FISHING , WE 'D TAKE A HALF A DOZEN PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICHES AND THINK WE WERE LIVING LIKE KINGS . WELL , I LIKE TO THINK THE REALITY I CREATE IS A LITTLE BIT TASTIER THAN THAT . [ LAUGHS ] GOOD . HEY , WE OUGHT TO GET GOING . HEY , KYLE ! COME ON , BUDDY ! LET 'S GET MOVING ! COME ON ... IT 'S YOU . THE GIRL IN THE ROAD . THAT 'S RIGHT . YOU REMEMBER . MAIA . HAVE WE MET BEFORE ? DON 'T BE SILLY . NO , NO , I 'M SORRY . I-I DON 'T REMEMBER YOU . SURE YOU DO . THINK HARDER . IS THAT WHY YOU KEEP SHOWING UP ? BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO REMEMBER ? I 'M HERE BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT ME HERE . THERE HAS TO BE A REASON WHY THIS GIRL KEEPS SHOWING UP . THERE WAS NOTHING FAMILIAR ABOUT HER ? NOTHING AT ALL ? NO ... BUT SHE KEPT ACTING LIKE WE KNEW EACH OTHER , IF I DID BRING HER THERE , THEN I MUST KNOW HER FROM SOMEWHERE . [ SIGHS ] [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] TOM ... SHOULDN 'T YOU BE AT WORK ? JARVIS SAID YOU CALLED IN SICK . WELL , I 'M ALLOWED . THANKS FOR CHECKING IN ON ME . COME ON , DIANA . TALK TO ME . WHAT ARE YOU ... WHAT THE HELL 'S ALL THIS ? IT 'S JUST A PROJECT I 'M WORKING ON . I MENTIONED IT TO YOU . WHO 'S THIS SUPPOSED TO BE ? I WISH I KNEW . I KNOW THIS MIGHT SOUND CREEPY , BUT I WAS UP ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT CUTTING OUT PICTURES OF LITTLE GIRLS , AND NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO BE THE RIGHT ONE . I MEAN , I THINK I 'M GOING CRAZY . THEN WE BOTH ARE . YOU KNOW THOSE LITTLE DREAM VACATIONS I TAKE WITH ALANA ? THIS LITTLE GIRL KEEPS SHOWING UP IN THEM . THIS LITTLE BLONDE GIRL , SAYS HER ... HER NAME IS MAIA . MAIA ... OH , TOM ... WHAT ? YOU HAVE TO COME WITH ME . I HAVE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING . WHO IS SHE , TOM ? WHO IS MAIA ? i don 't konw THERE 'S NO MENTION OF SOMEONE NAMED MAIA IN ANY OF OUR CASE FILES . OKAY , WELL , MAYBE WE MET HER TOGETHER SOMEPLACE ELSE . MAYBE AT ONE OF GARRITY 'S BARBECUES . NO , THAT DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT . I DIDN 'T JUST MEET THIS GIRL ONCE AT A BARBECUE . I KNOW HER BETTER THAN THAT . ALL RIGHT , JUST CALM DOWN . WELL , THERE 'S A REASON THIS GIRL IS HAUNTING US , TOM . OKAY , SHE 'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE , AND SHE WANTS US TO FIND HER . WELL , RIGHT NOW THE ONLY PLACE I KNOW SHE EXISTS IS IN ONE OF THESE DREAMWORLDS THAT ALANA AND I CREATE . WELL , THEN I NEED FOR ALANA TO TAKE ME THERE . I NEED TO MEET THIS GIRL , TALK TO HER . NO , BUT YOU WOULDN 'T REALLY BE TALKING TO HER , DIANA . YOU 'D JUST BE TALKING TO WHATEVER YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS REMEMBERS OF HER . WELL , MAYBE THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME TO FIGURE OUT WHO SHE IS . [ * * * ] HOW DO I SOUND ? LIKE YOU 'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR YEARS . BUT I HAVEN 'T . IT 'S MY FIRST TIME . I KIND OF FIGURED THAT . ISABELLE , YOU HAVE A MINUTE ? HAVE A SEAT . [ SIGHS ] UH ... ISABELLE , YOU KNOW I 'M PROUD OF YOU , DON 'T YOU ? THIS IS ABOUT SHAWN AND I HAVING SEX , ISN 'T IT ? THAT- - THAT 'S PART OF IT , YEAH , YEAH , BUT ONLY PART OF IT . RIGHT NOW , EVERYTHING IS NEW TO YOU . YOU 'RE LEARNING SO MUCH , SO FAST . HOW TO BE A ... A DAUGHTER ... A FRIEND- - A LOVER . THAT PART YOU MIGHT BE LEARNING A LITTLE TOO FAST- - I WOULD JUST LIKE IT IF YOU AND SHAWN SLOWED DOWN- - STOPPED SLEEPING TOGETHER ? FOR THE TIME BEING . THERE 'S NO REASON TO STOP . SHAWN CARES ABOUT ME . I CARE ABOUT SHAWN . THE SEX IS WONDERFUL . IT MAKES US BOTH VERY HAPPY . IT SHOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY , TOO . MAYBE IT SHOULD , BUT IT DOESN 'T . I SUPPOSE THAT 'S NORMAL . BUT EVERYTHING 'S GOING TO BE OKAY . SHAWN WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HURT ME . HE 'S WAY TOO SMART FOR THAT . SO YOU SEE ? YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT . I WONDER IF ANYONE AT THE CENTER HAS A CELLO . SO , WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO ? WELL , THE MAIN THING IS TO RELAX . OH , MY GOD . I USUALLY CLOSE MY EYES AND COUNT BACKWARDS FROM 10 . BEFORE I REACH ZERO , WE 'RE SOMEWHERE ELSE . DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE YOU WANT ALANA TO TAKE YOU ? WE USUALLY HAVE A DESTINATION PICKED OUT . WELL , WHEREVER MAIA IS . I MEAN , YOU CAN DO THAT , CAN 'T YOU ? YOU CAN TAKE ME TO HER . SHE SEEMS TO SHOW UP ANY PLACE WE GO . SO IT 'S REALLY UP TO YOU . ALL RIGHT , WELL , LET 'S JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE . HOW ABOUT MY APARTMENT ? ALL RIGHT . NOW , LET 'S BEGIN . ALANA ... THIS IS NOT MY APARTMENT . I KNOW . I 'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT JUST HAPPENED . YOU DONE TALKING TO YOUR FRIEND ? YOU 'RE MAIA . STOP FOOLING AROUND . COME ON . HE 'S WAITING FOR US . THERE YOU ARE , MS. SKOURIS . THE DOCUMENTS ARE ALL READY . IF YOU 'LL JUST HAVE A SEAT AND SIGN WHERE INDICATED , WE CAN FINISH UP . YOU STILL WANT TO DO THIS ... DON 'T YOU ? DIANA SKOURIS , YOUR ADOPTION OF MAIA RUTLEDGE IS HEREBY COMPLETE , LEGAL , AND BINDING . SO WITNESSED BY ME , HENRY BIEDERMAN , OF THE TENTH CIRCUIT FAMILY COURT OF SEATTLE . YOU KNOW , SOME OF US HAVE TO LOOK FAR AND WIDE TO FIND THE PEOPLE WE 'LL CALL FAMILY . YOU TWO HAD TO LOOK CLEAR ACROSS TIME . DIANA , LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO YOUR DAUGHTER MAIA . MAIA , SAY HELLO TO MOMMY . OH , MY GOD , MAIA ... OH , MY GOD ... MY GOD ... DIANA , WHAT HAPPENED ? SHE WAS KIDNAPPED , TOM . SHE WAS TAKEN BY A WOMAN PRETENDING TO BE HER SISTER . SHE TOOK MAIA , TYLER DOWNING , LINDSEY HAMMOND , AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF 4400 KIDS . DO YOU REMEMBER ANY OF THIS ? NO . NO , I DON 'T . SO THIS WOMAN TOOK THESE CHILDREN , AND SOMEHOW MADE EVERYONE FORGET THEY EVER EXISTED ? YES , BUT THEY EXISTED . MAIA RUTLEDGE DISAPPEARED FROM CRESCENT CITY , CALIFORNIA MARCH 3rd , 1946 . WAIT , YOU 'RE SAYING SHE WAS ABDUCTED , THEN RETURNED WITH THE OTHER 4400 , THEN TAKEN AGAIN , AND NONE OF US REMEMBER THIS BUT YOU ? IT 'S LIKE THEY 'VE WIPED ALL OUR MEMORIES . BUT WHY ? BECAUSE THEY DIDN 'T WANT US LOOKING FOR THEM . THE 4400 WERE TAKEN AND RETURNED TO CHANGE THE FUTURE IN SOME WAY , AND MAYBE MAIA AND THE OTHERS WERE TAKEN SO THAT THEY COULD CHANGE IT AGAIN , BUT I DON 'T KNOW , AND I DON 'T CARE . ALL I KNOW IS THAT FOUR DAYS AGO , SHE WAS HERE WITH ME , AND I NEED YOU TO BELIEVE THAT I HAVE A DAUGHTER NAMED MAIA , AND THAT SHE 'S BEEN TAKEN FROM ME . I DON 'T REMEMBER MAIA , OR THE KIDNAPPING , OR ANY OF IT , AND THE IDEA THAT MY MEMORY 'S BEEN MESSED WITH SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME , BUT AFTER EVERYTHING WE 'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH THE 4400 , YES , DIANA ... I BELIEVE YOU . [ CELL PHONE RINGING ] HELLO . RICHARD TYLER ? YES . WHO IS THIS ? MY NAME IS DANIEL ARMAND . YOU KNOW WHO I AM ? OF THE NOVA GROUP ? I THINK IT 'S TIME YOU AND I MET , RICHARD . WE HAVE A LOT TO DISCUSS . I HAVE A LOT I 'D LIKE TO SAY TO YOU , TOO , BUT I DON 'T THINK YOU 'RE GOING TO WANT TO HEAR IT . NOW , YOU SEE , THAT 'S THE PROBLEM , RIGHT THERE . WE SHOULD BE ALLIES , NOT ADVERSARIES . MY GROUP AND YOUR ORGANIZATION HAVE THE SAME GOAL . WE 'RE ADVOCATING FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE 4400 . EXCEPT THAT YOU ADVOCATE THROUGH ASSASSINATION AND INTIMIDATION . WE LACK THE STRENGTH OF NUMBERS , RICHARD , SO WE USE THE TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL . IS THAT WHAT YOU CALLED ME FOR ? TO HAVE A DEBATE ? I CALLED TO ARRANGE A TRUCE , AND TO TALK ABOUT SHAWN FARRELL . YOU GOING TO MAKE MORE THREATS AGAINST HIM ? NO , WE NEED TO DISCUSS HIS FUTURE , RICHARD . BECAUSE UNLESS YOU AND I CAN COME TO SOME KIND OF AN AGREEMENT , I 'M NOT SURE HE 'S GOING TO HAVE ONE . [ CLICK ] HE SAYS I SHOULD MEET HIM ON THE CORNER OF PIKE AND GORCH THURSDAY AT 4 : 00 . AND THEN ? A CAR WILL BE THERE TO PICK ME UP AND TAKE ME SOMEPLACE FOR A FACE-TO-FACE WITH ARMAND . SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE NOVA GROUP 'S BEEN READING TOO MUCH JOHN LeCARRE . WHAT DID YOU SAY ? I TOLD HIM I 'D THINK ABOUT IT . WHAT IS THERE TO THINK ABOUT ? YOU 'RE NOT GOING . WHOA , LET 'S NOT RUSH TO JUDGMENT . I 'VE DEALT WITH THIS GUY BEFORE , REMEMBER ? HE WANTS ONE THING . YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS . MONEY , AND PROBABLY THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF EVERY 4400 IN OUR COMPUTER . IF THEY HAVE AN ABILITY THAT HE CAN USE , HE WILL EXPLOIT IT , AND PEOPLE WILL DIE . PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY DIED . MAYBE I CAN STOP IT . WHAT , ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE HIM SEE THE LIGHT ? NO , BUT MAYBE I COULD STOP HIM FROM KILLING YOU . HOW ? HOW ? BY PUTTING THIS PLACE AND EVERYTHING THAT WE 'VE WORKED FOR IN JEOPARDY ? I WON 'T LET YOU DO THAT . NOBLE WORDS , SHAWN , BUT MAY I REMIND YOU IF THE NOVA GROUP WANTS TO STRIKE AT YOU , I DON 'T THINK THERE 'S ANY WAY WE CAN PREVENT IT . THANK YOU FOR THE PEP TALK , MATTHEW . JUST BEING REALISTIC . SO AM I. IF I DON 'T SHOW , IT 'S LIKE A DECLARATION OF WAR , AND WE ALL KNOW WHO THE FIRST CASUALTY WILL BE . YOU AND JORDAN COLLIER BUILT THIS PLACE . YOU 'RE ITS HEART AND SOUL . THEN LISTEN TO ME , RICHARD . I TRIED TO DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE BEFORE . IT WAS A DISASTER . I 'M WARNING YOU ... I 'M ASKING YOU ... PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE . PLEASE . SKOURIS , I HAVE A LIST RIGHT HERE OF EVERY 4400 WHO RETURNED THAT NIGHT TO HIGHLAND BEACH . THERE 'S NO MAIA RUTLEDGE , THERE 'S NO TYLER DOWNING , THERE 'S NO LINDSEY HAMMOND . I 'VE EXPLAINED THAT . THEY 'VE BEEN ERASED . FROM THE RECORDS , FROM OUR MEMORIES . SOMEONE HAS TRIED TO WIPE OUT EVERY TRACE OF THEM . WE TALKED TO THE FAMILIES . IN THE LAST WEEK , ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN HAUNTED BY PHANTOM MEMORIES OF CHILDREN THEY SUPPOSEDLY LOST YEARS AGO . OKAY , LET 'S SAY FOR A MINUTE THAT I AM BUYING ANY OF THIS , AND I 'M NOT , BUT IF I DID , WE DON 'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THEY WERE TAKEN . THE FUTURE ? THAT 'S KIND OF OUT OF OUR JURISDICTION . I 'VE SEEN MAIA . I 'VE SPOKEN TO HER . WE BOTH HAVE . OKAY , LOOK , YOU ARE ASKING ME TO COMMIT MANPOWER AND RESOURCE YOU GUYS PLAY AROUND IN . LOOK , I 'M SORRY , BUT I CAN 'T DO IT . UH , YOU GUYS THROUGH ? BECAUSE I THINK I FOUND YOUR KIDS . [ MARCO ] : HERE WE GO . WATCH THIS . THAT 'S HIM . THAT 'S TYLER . IT 'S DATED SEPTEMBER 19th , 1893 . THEY SENT HIM BACK FURTHER INTO THE PAST ? WHY ? WELL , THAT , I CAN 'T TELL YOU . BUT TYLER DOWNING DID GRADUATE FIRST IN HIS CLASS FROM YALE UNIVERSITY IN ENGINEERING . I KNEW I 'D HEARD THE NAME BEFORE . IN 1915 , HE HELPED DEVELOP SYNTHETIC PETROLEUM . YOU DROVE TO WORK THIS MORNING BECAUSE OF THIS GUY . LINDSEY HAMMOND . JUNE 11th , 1918 . THIS IS FROM THE ESTATE OF ROBERT GODDARD . YOU KNOW , THE ROCKET GUY ? HE ADOPTED AN ORPHAN NAMED LINDSEY HAMMOND . EVENTUALLY WORKED IN HIS LAB , AND SHE INVENTED ALL THE COMPOSITE MATERIALS USED IN THE FIRST LUNAR COLONIES . OKAY , SO , WHAT ABOUT MAIA ? DID YOU FIND ANY PHOTOS OF HER ? UH , NO , SHE ... SHE WAS A LITTLE HARDER TO TRACK DOWN , BUT , UH , I FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING . THAT 'S MAIA 'S HANDWRITING . IT 'S A DIARY , FROM MAIA RUTLEDGE . DATED APRIL 19th THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2nd , 1847 . IT WAS WRITTEN WHILE SHE WAS PART OF A WAGON TRAIN MAKING ITS WAY ALONG THE OREGON TRAIL . I 'M SORRY , SHE CROSSED THE ROCKIES IN A COVERED WAGON ? UH ... NO . SHE DIED OF SMALLPOX IN OCTOBER OF ' 47 . SHE WAS 25 . NO , I 'M SORRY , SHAWN , BUT IT 'S NOT MY FATHER 'S DECISION , IT 'S MINE , AND I 'M NOT BREAKING UP WITH YOU . IT 'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR DAD . NOT REALLY . YOU AND I MADE SOME DECISIONS . WE DID SOME THINGS . WE DID WHAT WE WANTED TO DO , AND THERE 'S NO REASON WE CAN 'T KEEP DOING THAT . WE 'LL BE MORE CAREFUL . MY FATHER WON 'T KNOW . THAT 'S NOT GOING TO WORK , NOT ANYMORE . LYING TO HIM , GOING BEHIND HIS BACK , WE 'VE DONE ENOUGH OF THAT . THE TRUTH IS , ISABELLE , I KIND OF TOOK ADVANTAGE OF YOU , AND I 'M REALLY SORRY . YOU ARE SO SWEET THE WAY YOU WORRY ABOUT ME . I DON 'T WANT THIS RELATIONSHIP TO END . SO IT 'S NOT GOING TO . [ INSISTENT KNOCKING ] I NEED TO SEE HER . PLEASE , CAN YOU TAKE ME TO SEE MY DAUGHTER ? DIANA , YOU KNOW IT 'S NOT REALLY MAIA YOU 'D BE SEEING . OH , I DON 'T CARE . TODAY I FOUND OUT THAT MY DAUGHTER , WHO I LOVED ... WAS SENT BACK INTO THE PAST , AND DIED 150 YEARS AGO , AND I 'M SORRY , BUT THAT 'S GOING TO TAKE ME AWHILE I JUST ... PLEASE , LET ME DO THIS . I NEED TO SAY GOODBYE . GIVE ME YOUR COAT . I 'LL PUT SOME COFFEE ON . READY ? MOMMY ... MOMMY , I 'M STARVING . CAN WE HAVE PANCAKES ? I 'LL HELP MAKE THEM . OKAY . WELL , I 'LL NEED THE EGGS FROM THE FRIDGE ... AND BRING ME THE BIG PLASTIC BOWL . [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] OH , MY GOD . ALANA ! ALANA ! ALANA , HONEY ... MY GOD , YOU 'RE BLEEDING . ARE YOU OKAY ? I-I THINK SO . DIANA ... DIANA , CAN YOU HEAR ME ? DIANA , LOOK AT ME . WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED ? I THOUGHT I WAS BRINGING US OUT . WELL , WHY ISN 'T SHE AWAKE ? I COULDN 'T HOLD ON TO HER . IT 'S AS IF SHE PULLED AWAY . THOMAS ... I THINK SHE 'S STILL INSIDE THE DREAMWORLD . HOW CAN SHE BE IN THERE WITHOUT YOU ? I 'M NOT SURE . WHEN YOU AND I SEPARATE , WE LET GO OF THE ILLUSION , BUT SHE 'S NOT LETTING GO . WHAT , SHE 'S NOT COMING OUT ? I THINK SHE 'S HAPPY THERE WITH HER DAUGHTER , AND SHE HAS NO INTENTION OF EVER LEAVING . OH , COME ON . COME ON ... AT FIRST I THOUGHT SHE 'D SUFFERED SOME KIND OF INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE , BUT THE M.R.I. DIDN 'T SHOW ANY BLEEDING IN THE BRAIN . SO SHE HASN 'T SUFFERED ANY DAMAGE ? NOT YET , BUT THE E.E.G. WAS VERY TROUBLING . HER BRAIN ACTIVITY IS FAR ABOVE NORMAL AND CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE . THE SAME IS TRUE FOR HER HEART RATE , HER BREATHING , HER BLOOD PRESSURE . THEY 'RE ALL RED-LINING , IF YOU WILL . ANY IDEA WHAT 'S CAUSING IT ? I REALLY CAN 'T SAY AT THE MOMENT , BUT HER METABOLIC RATE CAN 'T STAY AT THIS LEVEL FOR VERY LONG . EVENTUALLY , HER ORGANS WILL FAIL . WHAT , SHE COULD DIE ? UNLESS WE CAN SLOW DOWN HER RATES , WE 'RE LOOKING AT A VERY POOR OUTCOME . DOES SHE HAVE ANY FAMILY ? [ SIGHS ] YEAH . YOU SHOULD CALL THEM . I NEED TO TALK TO HER . CAN YOU DO THAT ? TAKE ME TO SEE DIANA . PUSH ME A LITTLE , MOMMY . HEY , I AM PUSHING YOU . THEN MAKE IT HIGHER . LOOK , NOT TOO HIGH . BUT THAT 'S THE WHOLE FUN . SHE HAS A POINT . I THOUGHT I 'D BE SEEING YOU TWO . I DIDN 'T HURT YOU , DID I ? IT FELT A LITTLE JARRING WHEN YOU LEFT . I 'M FINE . YOU , ON THE OTHER HAND , ARE NOT . WELL , THAT 'S WHERE YOU 'RE WRONG , BECAUSE I FEEL GREAT . YOU 'RE IN AN I.C.U. , DIANA . I THOUGHT I MIGHT END UP THERE . WHAT 'S MY HEART RATE ? IS IT 170 ? 175 ? THAT STILL PROBABLY GIVES ME , WHAT , ANYWHERE FROM THREE WEEKS TO TWO MONTHS ? THAT COULD BE FOREVER IN HERE . YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE . I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN , TOM , I DO , BUT REALLY , I 'D LIKE YOU TO LEAVE NOW , BOTH OF YOU . LISTEN , DIANA , BELIEVE ME- - DON 'T WALK AWAY . THE FIRST TIME I CAME TO ONE OF THESE PLACES , I NEVER WANTED TO LEAVE , BUT I CAME TO REALIZE THIS IS NOT THE WORLD . NONE OF THIS IS REAL , INCLUDING ... MAIA . MOMMY , PUSH ME A LITTLE HARDER . SHE 'S REAL ENOUGH FOR ME . WHEE ! OH , SHE 'S NOT COMING BACK , IS SHE ? SHE 'S GOING TO DIE IN THERE . THAT SEEMS TO BE HER PLAN . I CAN 'T HELP BUT THINK THIS IS MY FAULT . I TOOK HER THERE . NO , DON 'T DO THAT TO YOURSELF . YOU DIDN 'T TAKE MAIA AWAY . THE PEOPLE WHO DID THAT , THEY 'RE TO BLAME . MAYBE ... BUT THESE PEOPLE , THE FUTURE , THEY DON 'T SEEM TO CARE WHO THEY HURT , DO THEY ? NO , THEY DON 'T . 4 : 00 IS FAST APPROACHING . HAVE YOU COME TO A DECISION ? DO I WANT TO GET IN BED WITH A TERRORIST OR GO TO WAR WITH ONE ? THAT DOES APPEAR TO BE THE QUESTION . WHATEVER YOU DECIDE , YOU CAN COUNT ON MY SUPPORT . ISABELLE ? ISABELLE ... MY RELATIONSHIP WITH SHAWN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU . THAT 'S NOT TRUE . I JUST CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU . YOU CAN CARE ABOUT ME ALL YOU WANT . JUST STAY OUT OF MY BUSINESS . I 'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT . YES , YOU ARE . [ INHALES SHARPLY ] [ CHOKING ] ISABELLE ... AH ! [ GASPING IN PAIN ] [ CHOKING ] [ GASPING AND CHOKING ] DADDY ... [ GASPING ] DADDY ... I 'M SORRY . I 'M SORRY . OKAY ... IT 'S ALL RIGHT , BABY . I DON 'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ME , BUT I 'VE BEEN THINKING . YOU KNOW , EVER SINCE THE 4400 CAME BACK , IT 'S BEEN ONE SACRIFICE AFTER ANOTHER . YOU , YOUR DAUGHTER , MY SON ... . IT HAS TO STOP . SO I HAVE A PLAN . I 'M NOT SURE IT 'S GOING TO WORK . IT MIGHT BE THE STUPIDEST THING I 'VE EVER DONE . I KIND OF WISH YOU WERE HERE TO STOP ME , BUT YOU 'RE NOT , AND I HAVE TO TRY SOMETHING . MAYBE THIS IS GOODBYE , MAYBE IT ISN 'T . THE JOB WOULDN 'T HAVE BEEN ANY FUN WITHOUT YOU . OKAY , OKAY . OKAY , THIS IS GOING TO WORK , RIGHT ? IT WORKED , RIGHT ? I 'M- - I 'M NOT DEAD . NOT THIS TIME , NO . NEXT TIME , YOU MIGHT NOT BE SO FORTUNATE . THE CHILDREN YOU TOOK , MAIA AND THE OTHERS , I WANT THEM BACK . YOU WERE NEVER MEANT TO REMEMBER THEM . WE WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ERASE THEM FROM YOUR MEMORY , TO SPARE YOU ANY PAIN . IT DIDN 'T WORK . IT APPEARS WE UNDERESTIMATED THE BONDS THEY HAD FORGED . IT 'S CALLED FAMILY . ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT ? YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO TAKE THEM , TREAT PEOPLE LIKE THAT . MAIA WAS ONLY 25 WHEN SHE DIED . NOW , EITHER RETURN THE CHILDREN , OR PUT THAT ROPE BACK AROUND MY NECK , BECAUSE I 'M DONE . IN THAT CASE , I NEED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING . THEY 'RE ALIVE . YOU FORCED US TO GO BACK ... EXTRACT THEM FROM THE TIMELINE , BUT RETURNING THEM TO YOU WOULD BE A MISTAKE , FOR OUR TIME , AND FOR YOURS . THE 4400 WERE AN EXPERIMENT WE ALWAYS KNEW MIGHT FAIL . THERE WERE SO MANY VARIABLES . IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THEM ALL . SO YOU 'RE TELLING ME EVERYTHING YOU 'VE DONE , TAKING THE 4400 , SENDING THEM BACK , IT HASN 'T CHANGED ANYTHING ? THE CATASTROPHE 'S STILL COMING ? OUR ENEMIES ARE MORE RESOURCEFUL THAN WE IMAGINED . ENEMIES ? THERE ARE THOSE AMONG US WHO WOULD PREFER HISTORY TO REMAIN UNCHANGED , THAT THE 4400 FAIL IN THEIR MISSION . YOU MEAN , THEY WANT HUMANITY TO DIE OUT ? THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT THEY WILL SURVIVE . NOT ONLY SURVIVE , BUT BENEFIT FROM THE CHAOS . IF YOU THINK WE ARE HEARTLESS , I ASSURE YOU THAT THE OTHER SIDE IS UNIMAGINABLY MORE BRUTAL , AND THEY 'VE LET LOOSE A TERRIBLE EVIL INTO YOUR TIME . SENDING THESE CHILDREN FURTHER BACK INTO THE TIMELINE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO COMBAT THAT EVIL . IF WE RETURN THEM TO YOU , ALL THE GOOD THAT THEY 'VE DONE IN THE PAST WILL BE NEGATED . THE 4400 AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY WERE MEANT TO ACHIEVE WILL BE IN JEOPARDY . THIS EVIL , THERE HAS TO BE SOME OTHER WAY TO DEAL WITH IT . THERE IS . YOU . YOU ARE THE OTHER WAY . IT 'S A BURDEN THAT WE HAD HOPED NOT TO PLACE ON YOU . IF YOU RETURN MAIA AND THE OTHERS , I 'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT . WHAT WE WANT , YOU MAY NOT BE WILLING TO GIVE . DO WE HAVE A DEAL OR NOT ? WE DO , BUT IT 'S A DEAL I 'M AFRAID YOU 'LL COME TO REGRET . [ GASPING ] HELLO ! HELLO ! IS THERE ANYONE HERE ? [ FAINT VOICES MURMURING ] MAIA ? [ GASPS ] TOM ! MAIA ... MAIA ... IT 'S OKAY . HE WORKS WITH MY MOM . WE WERE KIDNAPPED . WHERE IS SARA ? [ KIDS CLAMORING ] CAN WE GO HOME ? DID YOU CATCH HER ? YEAH , YEAH , YEAH . YES . SHH ... YOU 'RE ALL GOING HOME . IT 'S OVER . YOU 'RE ALL SAFE NOW . IS MY MOM HERE ? SHE 'S NOT HERE , BUT I 'LL TAKE YOU TO HER , OKAY ? [ CLOCK TICKING ] [ CELL PHONE RINGING ] HELLO . HAS HE ARRIVED YET ? [ SIGHS ] THEN HE 'S MADE MY CHOICE FOR ME . [ EXHALES ] [ FAINT WHISPERS ECHOING ] WHERE ARE YOU HIDING ? COME ON ... I KNOW YOU 'RE WATCHING ME . I KNOW YOU 'RE LISTENING .

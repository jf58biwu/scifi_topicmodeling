 Previously on Bionic Woman ... This saving the world thing ? I 'd like to give that a try . Anything else ? What are you doing ? I 'm trying to buy back your love because I 've been working so much . You 've got some bad ideas in your head these days , don 't you , Sarah ? It 's the bionics , isn 't it ? They 've changed me . Turned me into this thing . We think Sarah Corvus might be working with Anthony Anthros . Will 's father ? He escaped from prison . He tried to sell bionics to the highest bidder . Am I a ticking time bomb , too ? I guess I just want to know the truth . About everything . I don 't like secrets , Jaime . You 're not going to kill me twice , are you ? Oh , we all know that if your training is worth a damn , I should be able to take this crowbar and swing it as hard and as fast as humanly possible . This is what you call studying at Rachel 's house ? Who the hell is she ? Nobody . Jaime , stop . You lied to me . Let go of me ! You looked me right in the face and you lied . You are a piece of work , you know that ? Are you insane ? This is the thanks I get for buying you those $ 1,000 jeans ? What the hell is wrong with you ? You 're 15 years old . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? I 'm living my life , Jaime . It 's none of your business . Oh , yes , it is my business . Hey ! Do you know she 's 15 years old ? You could go to jail ! You said you were 18 ! Shut up ! We 're going home . What did you do to my toe ? It 's my toe . And why does it hurt ? What happened to the self-healing anthrocytes ? Well , you 're an early prototype , Jaime . As time goes on , we 're going to discover countless imperfections . That 's so not reassuring . And you 're giving me the creeps . You keep staring at it . Do you have a foot fetish ? Actually , no , Jaime . I do not . I 'm pretty much just a simple boob man . You did this surveilling your sister ? She lied right to my face . Just looked at me and lied . " I 'm going to Rachel 's house . " Well , that 's what teenagers do . They lie . They get tattoos . They have wild sex , and then knock off liquor stores . Okay . Your toe is screwed . I 'm going to have to shock that thing into submission . All right . This shouldn 't hurt at all . On three . One . You suck ! Here 's what I think . You cannot begrudge a teenage girl the opportunity to make out in parked cars with older guys . It 's the lying . Isn 't this righteous indignation just a tiny bit hypocritical , considering you 're a $ 50 million weapon leading a double life ? That 's mean . Look , I don 't really care so much about what she does . I know she 's going to make stupid mistakes and all that . I just don 't want her to lie to me because then I can 't help her . That sounds good . Tell her that . Check it out . Good as new . You 're a genius . Let 's keep this between us , okay ? Sure thing . Thanks . I 'll see you and I 'll raise you all in . Everything . That 's a lot of coin . You know , people say that men take all the risks . I 'm here to tell you it isn 't true . You all turn out to be a bunch of scared little boys . It 's disappointing . It really is . Sarah , put your hands on your head . I guess the fun 's over . This is my boyfriend . It 's an on-again-off-again sort of thing . You know how it is . I killed all those people , he shot me in the head . Our friends call us The Bickersons . Isn 't that right , honey ? But you know what they say . At the end of the day , the most important thing in the world is love . I knew the game was fixed . I 'm sorry . You owe me $ 27,269 and 31 cents for the toe . How did you find out about that ? Your bionics represent the most advanced form of biotechnology known to man . It was developed to protect the human race . Not to spy on your delinquent sister . You know , I find your whole proprietary attitude about my body to be deeply inappropriate . How 's the toe ? Take a look at this . My name is Mark Stevens . I am an American doctor working in Paraguay . I am being held against my will . They say that they will kill me unless ... A group that calls themselves the Sons of the Red Sand took Stevens in Ciudad del Este two days ago . They claim he 's CIA . Is he ? He 's American . That 's enough for them . He 's got some incredibly sensitive information . And they 're going to behead him in 48 hours unless the CIA admits he 's theirs . Which they won 't . So why is this our problem ? You mean , besides the fact he 's an American who could get his head chopped off ? No . I mean , why isn 't the military sending someone in ? Paraguay never passed any anti-terrorism laws . They 're not about to let the U.S. mount an operation on their soil . But we can ? The two of you can . Anything that looks like Special Ops is out . But an American couple moving about the city ... I want to help this guy . But I don 't think I can fly off to Paraguay right now . Becca ... Becca will be watched 24l7 by a surveillance team . Okay , I 'm in . Just what am I going to tell Becca ? You 'll think of something . The eggs . You were cooking ? Who are you making breakfast for ? You . Why are you making me breakfast ? About last night , I just want to clear the air . I was ... Fine . Look , I 'm sorry I lied to you . Oh . No . I mean , I shouldn 't have done it . It was dumb . Besides , that guy 's a creep , anyway . I mean , usually those Internet chat room guys , you know , they turn out to be reasonably cool . Oh , my God ! I 'm kidding . God . You think I 'm retarded ? No , I don 't think you 're retarded . Yeah , you do . So what 's going on with you ? Well , Carly invited me up to Napa to celebrate her getting into law school . Well , that should be fun . Yeah . We land on an airstrip . An airstrip ? Is that different from an airport ? Well , yeah . It 's dirt . I have an asset in place . A local cop . He 's going to help us locate Stevens when we get there . How can you land a 747 on a dirt runway ? No . It 's not a 747 . It 's a little Gulfstream . Really ? You okay with that ? Yeah . I 'm good . Do you have any anti-anxiety meds ? Sedatives ? Anything in that area ? Hi , Jaime . How 's it going ? You look great . How 's Becca ? Stevens is running out of time . We have to go now . Jonas will take care of her . Come . We 're almost done . I 'm just getting started . Let him go , Sarah . Take him to the infirmary . You 're not helping yourself . Reflexes . Your reflexes were recalibrated through sensory neurons with your original surgery . That was hostility . You noticed . A girl likes to be noticed . Let 's cut to the chase . You 're having hand tremors , night sweats , anxiety , paranoia . Even paranoids have enemies . The bottom line is the medicine Anthros gave you , barely gave you any relief . The truth is it probably made you worse . And you 're going to fix me ? My hero . Isn 't that what you want ? From you I want nothing . Kill me , or let me go . You know , I tried that once before . It didn 't work . This time , I thought I 'd help . You don 't know how . Will was working on upgrades . I want Anthony Anthros . You tell me where he is , you get your life back . You 're full of crap , Jonas . And you 're getting worse . Who made me this way ? You 're a liar , Jonas ! A liar playing God ! My contact has a very good idea where Stevens is being held . Uh-huh . He 's going to meet us there , hook us up with some transportation . You okay ? I 'm scared of flying . I couldn 't find any drugs , and I think getting wasted before a mission is a bad idea . I just think , you know , hunk of metal in the sky . Counterintuitive . Okay . Okay . Let 's talk about something else . Okay . I 'm upset because I keep lying to my sister about my job . You 're protecting her . You 're not lying . If she knew the truth about you putting your life on the line , I don 't think she would be able to handle that . I don 't think I buy that . I think everybody should know the truth . Well , the world just doesn 't work like that , Jaime . But then , how can you have trust ? Trust and full disclosure is not the same thing . You trust me , right ? Relatively speaking . But what do you know about me ? What have I disclosed ? This is supposed to make me feel better ? All you need to know is that we 're a team and that I have your back . Isn 't that enough ? Thank you . Easy , tiger . Easy , easy . That 's your bionic hand . Sorry . Okay . We must hurry . No one can know we met . Remember , Paraguay is a complicated place . We have no laws against terrorism . And this group has legitimate business interests . Kidnap and ransom is legitimate ? All the perimeter doors are alarmed . The only other access is through the venting system . But it 's blocked by an exhaust fan . It 'll take your head off before they will . Thanks . We 'll keep that in mind . If they catch you , I don 't know you . My police won 't help you . My opinion , for what little it 's worth , this is suicide . But you Americans know all there is to know about handling these foreign situations , yes ? He 's an optimist . Okay . We get in , we get him , we get out . Sure . Easy . There wasn 't supposed to be an alarm . Just get us in . You know how to disarm it ? Stevens ' life is ticking away . Just do it . Trust me . You 're a machine . Don 't think about it . Even if it 's not real , it 's still attached . I 'd like to keep it that way . Give me a second . See ? Matter over mind . What now ? Are you crazy ? What the hell are you doing ? I suggest you follow my lead , or you 'll be shot . You told me I could trust you . Beauty is supposed to be the mark God sets upon virtue . And are you God in that homily ? She got less virtue than she bargained for . Look , I know you don 't want to believe this , but every step of the way , she had no bigger supporter than me . So why make her your enemy ? She needs help . Will came up with a fix before he was killed . We swap out the nerve bundles , infuse new anthrocytes . So what are you waiting for ? She knows where Anthros is . He 's been giving her treatment . Maybe if you fixed her , she 'd talk . Chicken . Egg . Be her friend , Jae . If you want to help her , help her help herself . At least we 're together . You 're out of your mind . We 're about to be executed . They 'll want to make an example out of us for Stevens , or make an example of him for us . Either way , it gets us to him . I need you to lose the fear and go bionic . If I told you what I was going to do , you would have backed out . Friends of yours ? I believe , Dr. Stevens , that you don 't believe what will happen to you if you don 't decode the contents of your flash drive . Which is nothing compared to what will happen to her . Please , I 'm working as fast as I can . Perhaps you need a little inspiration . Wait ! It 's a multi-level , asymmetric encryption . It 's going to take time . Now would be a good time , Jaime . Jaime , now ! Jonas says he can help you . And he 's got every reason to lie . He 's also a man of self-interest . You 're valuable to him . He 's playing you . Getting off watching this dance . Or you 're playing me . I want you to know you can trust me . I want you back . We all want something back . Even if Jonas could help me , I don 't trust him . Do you trust me ? Bring me proof that Jonas is telling the truth . That they made advancements they can use to fix me . I might remember where he can find Anthros . Take this rope . We 'll tie him and take him . Take the rope . Tie his hands up . We got to move . What are you going to do to him ? Well , no worse than what he was going to do to you . You want answers , right ? Then , when you 're done , take him down to the fan room . What about you and Stevens ? What about me ? He stays . What are you talking about ? You deciphered the flash drive . I don 't ... You were stalling . You read it ! What was on the flash drive ? Tell me ! You . Blueprints . Materials . Everything there is to know about bionics . If you know what was on that drive , then you know who gave it to me . To decipher , not to read . This doesn 't make any sense . We came here to save him . And we would have . I 'm not going to say anything . Yeah , until you 're caught , tortured , your brother is taken . They put a machete to a pretty girl 's neck . You were going to give it up . I was trying to save you . Take him down to the fan room . So you 're just going to kill him ? Is that it ? Jaime , go . Go ! Damn it ! Far end of the building , fan room . I 'll meet you there . Go . You let him go , he talks . You 're in the crosshairs . A target for people to catch and dissect . You won 't last a month . Then , I won 't . You okay ? You 've been hit . Go through . Thank you . What you did back there ... Was stupid . I 'm going to get us both killed . I have no plan . You know that , right ? There will be supplies in here . For your wound . We can 't stop . No . You can 't keep going . Can you get the lock ? Can you see what numbers were pushed ? Your eye . Can you tell what numbers ? Two , five , six , nine . These are usually four digit codes . That gives us 24 combinations . Let 's try to revert . Highest probability . All right . Who gave you the flash drive ? I have a contact . A voice on the phone . When he needs help , he tells me where to pick things up . What about the terrorists ? Do you know who hired them ? I assumed it was just them . That somebody tipped them off to what I was doing . Your body 's in shock . You really are a doctor ? That 's not just a cover ? Yale Medical School . Two-year residency at Walter Reed . Specialty in espionage ? I was always kind of a savant with word games and puzzles . How many words can you make out of the letters in YooHoo ? That kind of thing . I was showing off one day at Walter Reed . A CIA guy recruited me . You don 't feel that ? How bad ? The human response to a foreign object is to repel it . And fight it . Like an infection . But you ... Aren 't human ? You have anthrocytes . The files said they 're designed to keep your body from rejecting the bionics . So they work to incorporate what 's foreign , and not repel it . Doesn 't sound so bad . The anthrocytes are moving the bullet . It could damage other organs . I need to take it out . Now . She could be dead . She 's not . She 's still green . Well , it was your idea to send her in , Jonas . And you nearly got her executed . You know the risks involved better than anyone , buddy . No , no . Willingly surrendering a $ 50 million bionic woman is not in my playbook . Well , it got us inside to get Stevens and the flash drive . You don 't have the flash drive . And you don 't have Jaime . Well , how about I get off the phone , so I can go and find her ? Well , you 'd better . And , Antonio , you treat her like she 's expendable again , I won 't be this nice . Do not tell me how to do my job . I 'm going to go and get your girl back . Carly ? What are you doing here ? Nice to see you , too . Seriously , what are you doing here ? Is everything okay ? Yeah . I just borrowed these from Jaime . She home ? No . She 's in Napa . With you . Excuse me ? Exactly . What are you looking for ? What you promised Sarah . Proof of Will 's upgrades . You told me to get her trust . I 'm trying to get her trust . You didn 't trust me ? There 's nothing here . No files at all . What is going on , Jonas ? I don 't know . So you lied to me ? I told you Will was working on fixes . Not that I had them . Apparently , the files are on a flash drive in Paraguay . How ? I don 't think we knew Will as well as we thought . Damn it . Sorry . Not what you want to be hearing from your surgeon . How you holding up ? I 've been sitting here thinking about all the lies I 've been told . And the lies I 've been telling . Even to myself . How do you make peace with it ? You don 't . You do what you can and sometimes you pay a price . Three years ago , a lie I deciphered led to a bombing raid in Iraq . Eighty-seven civilians killed . Another 113 injured . I 'm sorry . So I came to Triple Border . To atone . Doctoring people who have nothing . What about the CIA ? Occasionally , they ask a favor . But now , I only succeed at deciphering those things that I can live with . If you had told the terrorists what you knew about me , they might have let you go . And I 'd have given them the technology to do what ? And then , who would they have sold it to ? Do the files say why it does that ? It stops after a few minutes ? Yeah . What ? It 's your bionic interface failing . And being reset . It keeps happening . It 's inherent in the system . And ? The anthrocytes function like an anti-rejection drug . But over time they become fatigued . So they 'll replace them ? On the flash drive , it talked about a five-year projection . Until what ? Bionic systems cease to function . What does that mean ? What does that mean ? You 're going to die . You can lead a horse to water , but you can 't make him drink . So that 's where we 're starting . With horses . Mr. Ed won 't drink . You grab him by the mane . Force him under . Hold him there long enough , he 'll swallow . The point is to interpret the saying . You do know your horses . You and your sister had one when you were little , am I right ? And Anne named it Coco ? Whatever happened to Coco ? People who live in glass houses shouldn 't throw stones . Or have sex without curtains . Me ? I like throwing stones . Wakes people up . You 're caught between a rock and a hard place . Now , you 're just trying to be funny . Actually I am just trying to do my job , which , as much as I don 't like it , means trying to understand you . I 'm messed up , honey . See , now we 're getting somewhere . Does that make you all warm and cuddly inside ? You should know I don 't do warm and cuddly . You 're caught between a rock and a hard place . Well , we both know how that ends , don 't we ? Three . Three ? You can make three words out of YooHoo . " Oh , " " yoo , " and " ooh . " Actually nine . You know when I said ... I 'm sorry . No . It 's good to hear the truth for once . He 's coming . Who ? Quick . Around the back . Here . Hold onto this . Wait here . What are you ... Just do it . There is no fix , is there ? Jonas is predictable , if nothing else . Tell me you love me . I love you . Let him go ! Stand down ! Stand down ! Sarah , stop . Seriously ? Is that the psychological way of talking me down ? Let Jae go . And you 'll what ? Help me ? Let 's go ! Move ! Move ! Move it ! Where is he ? Gone . Jaime , where is he ? You were going to kill him . I was just doing my job . You kept me completely in the dark . Sometimes , that 's what the job requires . I refuse to believe that killing an innocent person can ever make things right . Yeah , well . That information on the flash drive could save you . What we were doing here was for you . You think because I cost $ 50 million , my life is worth more than his ? We can talk about that later . Give him up . Now . No . No ! Stevens is what we call collateral damage . Killing him saves you . Maybe one day you 'll understand that . You want Stevens ? You 're going to have to get through me . And this time , you 're going to have to do it without a crowbar . I find this inappropriate workplace behavior . Now , who 's being inappropriate ? You don 't want to fight me . You know what I 'm capable of . Yes . Just because you 're a machine , doesn 't mean you can 't be beat . That hurt ? Yep . We 're gonna get out of here . She took that pen from the Tech . The one with the multi-fractured hand . She figured you 'd never help . The point is moot . She 's gone , and so is Will 's flash drive . Seems Jaime and Antonio had a misunderstanding . That can be dangerous . Antonio 's doctor can attest to that . So , if ... If Will 's work is gone , then what ? Sarah 's going to die ? I wouldn 't want to be in her shoes . I have never been snowboarding . That seems insane to me , now . I can 't believe I 've lived my whole life never having done that . My friends all head up to the snow together . Usually in February . You should come . Oh , you know , can 't plan that far in advance . You like to live in the moment , huh ? Go for it . See it , want it , take it . Never look back at the carnage . Exactly . Life 's too short . You have no idea . What do you say you and I get out of here ? Okay . Five years ? Listen , five years is a lifetime in technology , Jaime . It 's generations . You didn 't think I had a right to know ? Yeah , I just didn 't want to tell you . I wanted to protect you from the ... No . Stop . This is my life . You will not treat me like this . I 'm entitled to know . You will not lie to me . It 's disgusting . You 're right . You 're right . I 'm sorry . My sister ... We will find a way to fix this . Jaime , look at me . I will fix this . I 'll fix this . Hey . Hey . How was your trip ? Good . Yeah ? You have fun with Carly ? Yeah . We hung out . It was cool . Are you like , having an affair with a married man or something ? What ? Carly dropped off your shoes . God , you know . You 're just like Dad . You make these big pronouncements but , I mean , I can 't even trust a word you say . And you think that I 'm the liar ? What is going on , Jaime ? Just tell me , okay ? I need to know . I deserve to know . I can 't . I love you the most . Remember when Mom used to say that ? Yeah . Only she 'd say it so we could both hear . Now I love you the most . And I want to tell you everything . But I can 't . I ... You know , trust is supposed to be a two-way street . Yeah . I know . And it sucks . But you have to trust me , Becca . My new job , it 's complicated . I just ... I need to know that you 're never going to leave me . I will never leave you .

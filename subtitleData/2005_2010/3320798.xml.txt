 We all dream of being someone else , to ride a new wave , to be reborn , to start again . The only problem is if you let it , like a cancer , it will consume you . This isn 't the first time this story has been told and it certainly won 't be the last . But this is the real story and it could happen to you . # Kyrie eleison # # Kyrie eleison # # Christe eleison # # Christe eleison # # Kyrie eleison # # Kyrie eleison # # Christe eleison # # Christe eleison # # Kyrie eleison # # Christe eleison # # Christe eleison # # Kyrie eleison # # ... that I used to know # # Rediscover # # Lives that never seem to know where to go # # No , it 's nothing it 's nothing at all # # No , it 's nothing it 's nothing at all # # Doo-doo and it gets me ... # Oh Jesus ! Oh my God . Oh Jesus ! Tell me I didn 't do it . I didn 't do it . Oh ! Fuck no ! Fuck . J. Hey , stranger ! I brought you notes from class . J ? Oh , shit . J ? J ? Shhh no , no , no . Shhh . No , no , no , no , no . It 's okay , it 's okay . I 'm okay . Shhh . No , no , no , it 's okay . It 's okay . Shhh , shhh . Shhh . Shhh . Shhh . Shhh . Shhh . J ? Jesus Christ ! Shut up . I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . J ? Jesus ! What are you doing here , Martha ? I came to bring you notes . Is that blood on you ? ! Yeah it was just ... I had a little accident . It 's no big deal . An accident ? What ... what 's going on ? Nothing , nothing . It 's just ... J , what is going on ? We haven 't seen you all week and your place is a disaster and you 've blood all over you , what is going on ? ! I 've just been busy . Look at me . I 'm trying to help you ! I don 't need your help ! I don 't need anyone 's help . September 21st . I woke this morning to a girl in my bathroom . I 'm starting to do things I can 't remember . If Martha would have seen ... she must never know about him . I can 't believe it 's only been two weeks since Mary died . So what 's your new number ? Ah , that 's clever . Yeah , that 's what I 'm gonna call you from now on . No , I won 't take it . If that 's what you want , I promise . Would you just cool it ? Give me the rest of your number . Okay . I 'll bring it tonight . I 'll see you and the others later . Bye . - Hey , man . - Hi . - Hey . - Hey . Thanks for covering for me yesterday . Dude ! - Nice wipe out there . - Shut up , man . It was a good catch . It was nice . You playing or what ? No , man ? I 'm not playing . Danny boy , let 's get a beer or something . - See you guys later . - Okay . Bye . See you , guys . Hey , Jack ? Hey , Martha , how are you ? I 'm well , how are you ? What do you say we go up to my folks ' cabin this weekend for a little R and R ? J actually got us these amazing tickets this weekend to a concert so maybe another time ? Oh , all right . Okay . See ya . So we 'll see you tonight ? Yeah , well ... Oh , shut up . We 're gonna be there . Come on , okay , we 're going to be late . All right . - Bye . - See you . Listen , ass wipe I was trying to set her up for this weekend and you came along with your little tickets there . You are pathetic , you know that , Jekyll ? If you ever get in my face again , I 'll kill you , maggot . They tell you in school that how you play the game is all that matters . But that 's not true . Who cares who comes in second ? Winning is why you play the game and that 's all there is . Beating the other guy . Without that you 're nothing . Well , I 'm not gonna come in second anymore . Professor Higgins please go to the dean 's office . Professor Higgins please go to the dean 's office . You medical students think you 're indestructible . You got ten minutes . Oh , I can 't . Hey . Yes ... Yes , you can . Here . Okay . Right . Mary , you were my ... my best friend and , um ... and I love you . And you will always , always be in my thoughts . I was so sick of you always borrowing mine , so ... I don 't know what to say . I just wish this never happened . Life is eternal and love is immortal and death is only a horizon . And a horizon is nothing save the limit of our sight . I 'm so sorry . # Kyrie eleison # - Mary ? - Mary ? Did she take something ? Take her pulse . Take her pulse . I don 't know ! I just took her pulse . She 's freezing . Give her mouth to mouth ! # Christe eleison # You 're gonna make it , Mary . # Christe ... # That 's it , that 's it . Okay , that 's it . Somebody call a doctor ! Mary ! Somebody ! Do something ! Do something ! # Christe eleison # It 's not working . It 's not working . You gotta be kidding . It 's okay , it 's okay . Oh my God ! It 's okay . She OD 'd , J. My best friend OD 'd and I couldn 't save her . It wasn 't your fault . I know . There 's nothing you could have done . Why are you so nice ? Hm ? I 'm nice . You know , you always ... you always say the right things . What 's wrong ? I can 't do this . Why ? Because I can 't . Why , don 't you ... don 't you want me ? We are going to ... We are here to celebrate the life of our friend , Mary . And ... and get completely wasted in her name . Hey J ! J ! Come back here . # Time is colored in # # The black and white # # Of your sin # # So burn ... burn the flag # # Rip it up # # Bury the rags # # But I will find you still # # Move in for the kill # # You cut her hair # # So live , live long # # See her face in everyone # # Turn ... turn the page # # And start again # # Change your name # I 've taken my fourth dose , Wednesday , February 3rd . Increased the dosage from 3 to 5 milligrams . There 's been ... uh ... there 've been slight side effects non-debilitating , a slight euphoria perhaps . And now , ladies and gentlemen , the human brain . The most important organ in your body . This three-pound masterpiece has gotten the human race where it is today and will get it where it is going tomorrow . It is without question ... the last frontier of modern medicine and since this little brain dissection will account for 20 % of your final mark I suggest you use yours . Yeah , hey , I 'm just ... like 5 , 5 minutes , 5 minutes . Okay , guys , be aware that your specimens may have experienced trauma in the squamous temporal bone so look for extradural mass that presses against the cerebral hemisphere . Unfortunately , we can 't always get perfect specimens . Mr. Jekyll , I read your research suggestions last night . All your own work ? Yeah , it is . Well , we should talk . Oh , I 'm sorry , Professor Poole . The cops , they wanted to talk to me about what happened the other night . Oh . Well , you better make a start . Okay . - What did they wanna know ? - Hm ? - The cops . - Nothing . I haven 't seen them yet . But I ... I just sold the Mustang got a ' 67 Porsche . Why ? Why ? Why not ? Miss Udderson , Mr. Lanyon , if it 's not too much trouble , please . Right , sorry . - What is this ? - It 's an exam . Can you tell me where you 've been for the last three nights ? I 'm sorry . I was just out . what do you mean out ? Did you not think of calling ? No . I don 't need to tell you everywhere I am . You know what ? We can talk about this when you come home , okay ? Thank you . So you believe you can succeed where greater minds have failed ? Not exactly D.A. proof , is it ? I thought you could help me . Really ? And why is that ? Kids are cooking up this stuff all the time with shit they buy from the drugstore or off the internet ... and they are killing themselves too . Didn 't you learn anything from your friend 's death ? The recreational drugs you 're talking about are not the magic cure-all for life 's woes , J. You are intelligent enough to know that . There 's nothing recreational about what I want to do . They are already testing ecstasy for post traumatic stress syndrome . We should be doing the same type of drug research . Look , I admire your altruistic nature , J , but what you are talking about is paradise engineering altering someone 's personality . - For the better . - It 's just a dream . There is no way that I can give you permission for this line of research . The drugs involved are illegal . The laws is the law and we all have to work within its confines ill-conceived as you may think they are . Now , let me see if I can find you a safer line of research for your talents , maybe something that comes with a grant . Yeah , well , I don 't do safe . So screw your grant and screw you . Mr. Jekyll , if you wish to remain in this medical school you will take my advice 'cause God is not a D.J. and life is certainly not a dance floor . And while you 're searching for heaven be careful you don 't find hell . No , actually that 's not what happened . He was supposed to be here at 8.30 and he didn 't show up until 8.45 . No . Exactly , yeah . So that 's what I said to him . He 's got to show me a little bit more respect . Hang on a second , that 's my other line . Just a sec . Hello . Pharmacy . Hi , Dr. Drake . Uh , yeah , I think I have enough of that . Can I just give you a call right back ? I 've just got another emergency call . Okay . Thanks so much . Bye , bye . Hi , it 's me again . So what 's happening with Gary ? You didn 't ! Did you like it ? Aaah ! Macy are you there ? Macy ? Macy ! So here I am , afraid to move . I have no idea who she was or how she got there . But I know what I have to do . When I bring back Hyde , when I take the drug , everything 's okay . Disposing of a human body is never easy ... unless you 've been taught where to start . - Yes , that 's it . - Four vodka shots . You sure you 're gonna take care of this ? - I 'm sure . - Yeah ? That 's my dude . I like him . I like him . Hey , uh , you guys , we need to talk about J. Yeah , I haven 't seen him in days . Well , I went over to his place today and there is something up with him . I think there 's something wrong . He had some blood on him . Is this the same J we were talking about ? Yeah . But I think we need to seriously ... Yeah , guys , you know what ? Enough about J , all right ? Grab a little shot and ... Yes ! Jam it . Guys , hands out . Hands out . Now , ladies and gentlemen , these are Lanyon 's home-made party poppers . - Oh ! - Wow ! Just like grandma used to make . - Why ? Oh no . - Not tonight . Martha , these are really , really , good , okay ? I made them with my own hands . It 's good . Trust me , please , I 'm a doctor . You 'll be fine . - Mm . All right . - That was easy . Very good ! Whoo ! You spilt ! Hello . Do you want another one ? Hey , buddy . You need some help ? - Lanyon ? - Yes , that 's me . - Absolutely ... no . - Do you know her ? Do you know her ? Oh , yeah , I know her . Do not introduce my cousin to Cindy . Lanyon ! Absolutely not . Not Cindy . This is my cousin , okay ? - I love Cindy . - No , sweetie . No , she 's ... You wanna be introduced to Cindy ? - She is bad news . - I love Cindy , yes . - Everyone loves Cindy . - Everyone loves Cindy . Hey ! Oh , God ! Cindy ? - Over here ! - Does he really know her ? Yeah , we all do . - Oh no . - Come on . Great . Here 's Cindy . - Hi , Cindy . - Hi . Cindy . Hi . So are we gonna play hunt your little weiner again , Lanyon ? Oh . Boy , oh boy . That 's not right . How have you been ? Good . - Hey . - Cindy ... this is Josh . Josh , this is Cindy . Cindy , Josh is not training to be a doctor so he has a life . Josh , Cindy is a nurse . So she will shag anyone . Not you . Hey , Cindy . Nice one . Right there . Right there . I like that . What do you think ? Find yourself a nice corner and ... and play . - Josh ? - Fine . Go on . Bravo . Come on , I think that 's gonna work . - Thank you ! - I think it 'll last . I really do , I think it 'll last . Cindy , can I ask you something ? Mm-hm . Where the hell are we ? Oh , it 's the one place you can always be guaranteed to find a stiff . Is this a good idea ? What if somebody comes in ? - So play dead . - Vodka . Ah . This is weird . You said you 'd try anything . Yeah ... so up you get . It 's cold . Oh ! Cindy ? Cindy ? Cindy ! Hello , Cindy ? Cindy ! So are you ready to go again ? Josh ? Josh , where are you ? Stop fooling around . Josh ? - Oh , this door . - Right there . Yeah , you got it , you got it . Ha ! Forgot . It 's okay , it 's still there . Gentle with this , the window . Yeah . Well , thank you for getting me . It 's so nice . I 'm here for you , you know that ? I know . I 'm good . You know , I 'm ... I ... I 'm good . - You are ? - Yeah . You know , all that stuff that happened to Josh it was after he was dead . No , I know . So how is ... how is everybody ? Oh everyone 's good . Dan 's Dan . You know , I mean , there 's no change there . I 'm still as wildly popular with the ladies - as I was before . Yeah . - Of course . - And uh ... J ? - J ? J , he 's good . You know I ... uh I don 't really see him too much so ... so ... you know he 's working hard . I guess , getting it together , unlike some of us . I 've now increased the dosage to 20 milligrams . Yeah , there 's a ... there 's a small feeling of conflict within my soul but ... I am now violent , predatory , sexually aggressive . # One - take control of me # # You 're messing with the enemy # # Said it 's 2 - it 's another trick # # Messing with my mind # # I wake up chase down an empty street # # Blindly snap the broken beats # # Said it 's gone with the dirty trick # # It 's take all these days to find ya # # Ooh # # Ahh ahh ahh # # I tell you I want you # # Ooh # # Ahh ahh ahh # # I tell you I need you # # Ooh # # Ahh ahh ahh # # The blood on my face # # Ooh # # Ahh ahh ahh # # I just wanted you near me # This is no longer an experiment .

What can I get you ? Vodka , Red Bull and a soda . Mr. Hyde , this girl is clearly underage . Yeah , the vodka is for me . Thanks . These guys can 't tell jack shit . You sure look 21 to me . It 's Heather , right ? 12 dollars , please . Keep the change . So , how old are you ? Not much older than you . But who cares , right ? It 's what 's inside that matters . It 's who you are that counts . God , that 's exactly how I feel . Everyone 's always judging me , I just hate it . - Who judges you ? - I dunno . My mom , everyone . Well , your mom is wrong to judge you . Pretty girl like you . Stop it , you 're embarrassing me . Stop it ? I ... I just can 't help it . You 're just so pretty , Heather Poole . I bet all the boys have to get in line for you . - No . - No ? Well , they should . I know I would . That was nice . What do you say me and you we go somewhere a little more private ? What do you say , Heather Poole ? So , do you wanna make out ? Good morning , Mr. Kellar . I promise this won 't take long . Okay ... November 18th , I watched them again today . ... nausea and abdominal pain . Martha is finally back from burying her cousin . And there 's Dan . Look at him . Seems so pleased with himself . I can 't stand the sight of him . He reminds me of what I used to be . Everything about him makes me sick ! - Martha ? - Yeah ? You didn 't have to come back so soon , you know . Yeah , I know , I just was going crazy at home . Well , as long as you feel ready . You 'll find things are pretty much back to normal here . Of course they 've beefed up security . Have you talked to the dean ? - Yes . - Good . Well , I 'm not sure which classes you 're going to be attending either but give us a couple of days and we 'll sort it all out . Thanks . - Hey ! - Hi . It 's nice to have you back . Thanks . Ah ... did you get my emails ? I did . I ... I did get your emails . I 'm sorry I didn 't reply . It was hard .

I finished my last batch of the drug this morning . It 's becoming almost impossible to get it . I 'm running out of options . But I can never go back to who I was . Hey , Danny boy , you 're going to have to make effort , right ? None of this stupid shit . Just get off my case , man . Oh , Danny boy , I 'm only trying to help you . Oh , Danny boy . All right . Ha ha ha . Hey . Ch ... Christ , J. Christ ! You scared the shit out of me . I need you to get me some special shit . Can you get that for me ? - What 're you cooking ? - Can you get it or not ? ! I 'll see what I can do , but I 'm not gonna make any promises . - I owe you , man . - Wait , no , J ? - What ? - Are you okay ? I 'm fine , man . Thanks , though . You know , Martha , she was just here . She was just here . She says you haven 't seen her for days . I saw her . I saw her . Tell her I 'll meet up with her later . J , why don 't you just ... J , why don 't you just hop into a cab with me ? Leave me alone ! I just wanna be Hyde all the time . I had no idea how intoxicating this could be . J ? It 's me . J ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God , you scared the shit out of me . How 'd you get in here ? Your gate was unlocked . Look I ... I ... I came over here because I need to clear things up with you . You have been completely ignoring me . - Why ? - Am I ignoring you now . J , I 'm so sick of this back and forth shit between you and I. How could you not call me once when I was gone ? After everything I was going through and then ... I know you heard me over at your elevator the other day and you didn 't even let me in . Oh , my God . Oh ! Oh ! Oh , my God ! That was amazing . God , you look so good . You look different . Why didn 't you return my emails ? November 22nd . The dosage amounts I need at this stage are beyond toxic . I need so much more that , to have the same effect ... I 've become a slave to it . Every second of everyday it speaks to me . Wow ! I can 't believe you paid that guy 300 bucks to get in here . Yeah , well , that 's what it takes . I told you J wouldn 't show . Hey , it 's early . He promised he 'd come . He better come I already paid for him at the door . What ? You look amazing . Oh , Danny boy , thank you . Think we are all looking pretty hot tonight . Yeah . Thanks . - Here you go . - Oh , uh ... It 's ... it 's okay . It 's on the house . - You 're a guest now . - Uh ... whose ? - Hyde 's . - Oh yeah , right . I don 't know any Hyde . Me neither . Cheers . - Cheers . - Cheers . Okay . Unless they throw us out I 'm gonna party till I drop . And one more thing I 'm definitely being checked out by that girl at the bar . - Where ? - Right there . Hi ? I can 't believe him ! How does he do it ? Hey um ... Danny ? Yeah ? Mary knew a Hyde . It was written in her locker . Martha , just ... just chill all right ? We 'll ... we 'll sort it out tomorrow , okay ? Okay . Dan . So ... cool hairstyle and smooth clothes does it for you , huh ? J 's not even here . Yeah , well he might as well be . I 'm gonna go . Shit . You skank ! What 's the matter , Dan ? Not jealous , are we ? Dan , what the hell are you doing ? Ask this asshole . It feels good doesn 't it , Dan ? Fuck you ! November 26th . I wake with them every night now . Only I don 't think they 're nightmares . I think they 're memories . Then she says she wants to tie me up , right ? And I 'm saying no way . I mean I ain 't doing nothing like that shit . We just met . I mean the bitch could have cut my balls off , right ? Yeah . You with me here , Dan ? She wanted to tie me up , man . All right , you just gotta let her go . It 's ... it 's just not gonna happen , you know that . Yeah , but he 's so wrong for her . You didn 't see what I saw . Okay , J 's no saint but ... but who is ? Just cut him some slack , man , okay ? You know what you need to do , Danny boy ? You need to get out into the big wide world and start mowing some new lawns , you know what I mean ? Right ? Yeah . I 'll just be a minute and then we are gonna start reprogramming your sex life in that Irish pub on 4th , okay ? Don 't touch anything . See you later . Hey , how about we head ... Does that scare you , Dan ? Your ear 's bleeding . You a gambling man , Dan ? This is how it is , Dan . We 're gonna play this little game . If you win , you walk out of here alive . It 's your turn . Come on , Dan . It 's not that fucking hard . Put your hand , there you go . Cock it back , there you go . And pull the trigger ! Must be your lucky day , huh ? Lucky day . God , you are fucking pathetic . My turn , right ? I want you to watch me this time . Fucking watch me ! Are you watching me ? Are you watching me , Dan ! Are you watching ? ! That 's how you do it , Dan . That 's how you fucking do it . Quit fuckin ' around . Point it at your little fagotty head , that 's it . You ready , Dan ? Are you ready ? Are you ready to die , Dan ? There 's no way back . I can 't stop him . The drugs Lanyon got me were contaminated . One minute I 'm me and the next I become the devil himself . I 've lost all control . # Kyrie eleison # What you 're going to see is a young man with severe gunshot trauma to the head . Are you ready ? Can you positively identify the body as that of Daniel Cool ? It was called in as a suicide . Clearly it wasn 't . We 're just waiting on the prints to confirm it . Who would wanna hurt Dan ? I thought you might tell me that . Sorry . Oh , just one other thing . Do you recognize this ? No . Why ? It was in Daniel 's hand when he was found . Hey , J ? Hey , J , wait up . Wait up , J. Wait up , wait up . Hey , man , where have you been ? Dude , man , Dan 's dead . I know . Hey what ... hey ? Hey ? Hey ? Hey ? Hey ! What 's the matter with you ? Is that all you got to say ? They were contaminated , Lanyon . The drugs you got me were contaminated . - What ? ! - I trusted you ! And that 's the shit you get me ? Hey , what the fuck is the matter with you ? ! You have no idea what you 've done to me . Oh , yeah ? Listen to me . Anything you 've done , you 've done to yourself . I got what you asked for . No , I got what you asked for . Maybe you made the fucking mistake . The only mistake I ever made was having you as a friend . Fuck you . - Professor ? - Martha . - I really need to talk to you . - Not a good time . - It will have to wait . - Oh , my God . - She 's my daughter . - What happened ? - She was beaten , raped . - I didn 't ... I didn 't ... The police are looking for the guy now . - Let 's talk out here . - Okay . Just I know it was J 's pendant . I saw it on him . Look , before you call the police you should talk to J. Martha , there 's gotta be thousands of those pendants around . Can I use your phone ? D - E. H - Y - D - E. - Hyde - What did you say ? That 's right . No , Hyde 's not his real name . It 's Henry Jekyll . He 's one of my students . Yes , Martha Udderson . She 's here with me now . Well how would I know ? That 's your job . Find him ! Shit ! Fuck ! He should have hurt me , not you . - Oh , my God . - What ? He 's in the hospital . Shit . Martha , wait . Call the police , call them again . Look up , Lanyon , " something wicked this way comes " . Was it Shakespeare or was it Ray Bradbury ? I always get those two so confused , don 't you ? What ? What did you say ? Oh . God . All right . Just listen to me ! J ! Mate , I got these pills for you . I know you love these pills , right ? You love these pills , just like Grandma used to make , right ? Isn 't that what you say ? Lanyon 's home cooking . Let me see . Just a cold piece . It 's all right . Yeah , see ? There you go . That 's one , hold it in . That 's it . Open your fuckin ' mouth . Come on . That 's right . There you go , there you go . There you go . There you go . Back up . Oh , yeah . That taste good ? Quite a fighter , aren 't you ? Good , huh ? Good ? Look at you . Let 's just keep it back . There you go . You 're starting to piss me off . Jesus Christ . You better shut the fuck up and take these fucking pills ! You love these freaking pills . Fucking take them . All right . It 's all down . Don 't you throw up on me . That 's it , all right , all right . There we go . That 's it . That 's right . Martha , we should just stay in one spot . Then stay ! Martha ? Okay , they gotta be down there . This is dumb , Martha . Oh , God ! Oh , my God . Lanyon ! Lanyon ! Shut the fuck up , are you crazy ? Stop it ! No . Are you coming with me ? You 're not really going to do this . This is stupid , Martha ! Lanyon is my friend , okay ? Okay . Shit . Okay . Oh , my God . It 's so creepy . What is this ? I don 't know . I don 't know , it 's something , I don 't know . I had no idea this was underneath the hospital . Me either . Here . - Did you hear that ? - I don 't know . - Shit ! Shit ! - What ? Come on ! Professor ? Professor ? Shhh . Shhh . It 's just me . Let 's just go . Let 's get out of here . That 's gotta be it . J ! Open the door ! Open the door ! Oh , my God . No ! No ! Shit ! Open the door . Move ! Move ! - Push ! - Open the door . J ! Lanyon ! Where are you , Lanyon ? Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , no . Oh , my ... Oh , Lanyon . I 'm sorry . They tell you in school That how you play the game is all that matters . But that 's not true . Who cares who comes in second ? Winning is why you play the game . I mean , that 's all there is beating the other guy . Without that you 're nothing . Martha , don 't . Well , I 'm not going to come in second any more . I can hear you outside in the tunnel . Please , Martha , don 't judge me too harshly . All I ever wanted to be was somebody else . When the experiment fails , you terminate it . If I don 't ... if I did not kill myself now , I would kill you , Martha . And God knows I love you more than life itself . I 'm so sorry , Martha . Someone once said evil is the ultimate temptation . What 's so terrifying is that it 's within us all . If you let it , like a cancer it will consume you .

Thank you for taking the time to see me . I understand your reluctance To discuss these things over the phone . But I 'm pleased you 're still considering my job offer . I am. thank you . I appreciate a man who 's calm and careful In his decision making . The last time I went hunting For these things you want me to hunt , 20 other people died . I won 't let that happen again . Nor should you . These things ... They 're evil . We have to be careful , agent , Not to anthropomorphize a machine . These are more than machines , miss weaver . But I 'll never make the mistake of thinking they 're human . Two years ago , My husband and I were in a helicopter accident . He was killed . I 'm sorry. he was flying us to barstow . There was a microchip plant there doing some amazing things . So your husband was a pilot . He had over 700 hours on that particular helicopter . It was his passion . This is difficult for you . The kulishov a-85 is a beautiful flying machine . Like the most perfect bird . It 's almost flawless in its design . Almost flawless ? It needs a human to fly it . Are you saying that ... Machines make better decisions than humans ? What I think Is that in certain extreme conditions , Even the most calm and careful of men , panic . Help me find this machine , agent . You and I 'll take it apart piece by piece . I 'm not sure what we 'll find , But I doubt we 'll find evil . So much food . I know. we 're totally puking later . But whatever . It 's an occasion . I like your necklace . It 's cool , huh ? I got it from this awesome thrift store in echo park . So ... Two years ago , when I moved here from michigan , I had this internship at a storefront in chinatown . The designer was this total druggie . And when I finally called him out On what stuck up and talentless bitch he was , I got fired from my unpaid job . That 's when I started crashing with people And doing , you know , whatever ... For money ... Which got sketchy real quick . Especially in l.a. The city is like a freak magnet . You 'd look really pretty in this . We should bounce . How much you get for it , you crazy bitch ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . My laptop , the one with all the stuff on it ? I didn 't take your laptop , dude. weird . it just disappeared the same day you left . Hey , look- - Who are you , huh ? You a little thief too ? Huh ? Just take it. go ! Please just go ! Next time I see you , you 'd better hide me or something . All I 'm saying is sometimes You gotta take a punch once in a while In order to keep the cash- - that was a lot of cash . I 'm sorry . Well , fill it out So we can crash here for a couple of nights . I don 't know what to write . Doesn 't matter. lie . The other catch is You have to have this interview with a counselor . Just b.s. your way through it . Don 't tell them anything real . Nice . Where 'd you learn how too that ? I don 't know . You weren 't , like ... Getting beaten up or anything , were you ? Sorry about that thing I said earlier About taking a punch . If you 've gotten your fill , I shouldn 't have said it . But don 't worry . From now on ... I got your back . Wasn 't easy getting that shot . Where was it ? Tanzania . Paul and I just got back a couple weeks ago . But you didn 't come here to talk about zebras . I was hoping you could run a check On someone for me- - off the record . Who is it ?

You don 't remember what town you 're from ? Why does it matter ? It 's not there anymore . You know , sometimes when people forget , It 's because they need to forget ... Because something painful has happened . I 'm wondering if something has happened to you . Tell me about your life . I live in a tunnel . I eat garbage for dinner . Anything you say in here is confidential . The only exception is Is if you were planning to harm someone ... I would have to report that . I would never hurt anyone . Tell me about your family . Memory is a very associative thing . Sometimes sights , Sounds , even a smell can take us back . My father was an architect . He taught me how to draw . My mother was music teacher . She 'd sit for hours And listen to chopin . What 's that bracelet on your arm ? My sister gave it to me for my birthday . July 22nd ... I had a party in griffith park . All my friends were there .

I don 't really like talking about my past . I came to l.a. to start over . Did you ? Yeah. burned a lot of bridges here , though . Keep thinking I 'm gonna go someplace more authentic , You know , like portland . I could come with you . We could reinvent ourselves . We could . So ... who are you , really ? I 've never heard of you . Suddenly you 're kacy 's best friend . I 'm just a neighbor . Sorry. cop brain . Stresses her , you know . My job .

But my wife--um , well , my ex-wife ... Wasn 't meant to be . Bye , savannah . Your husband 's helicopter crash . I read the official report . The ntsb concluded That mechanical failure was to blame . Mechanical failure. correct . That 's not what you led me to believe the other day . Correct . Which is it ? What 's the truth ? You tell me . I think ... What people write in reports ... When it 's official Isn 't always true . I think if I had a child , One that I knew would grow up asking What happened to her daddy ... I think I would make sure that answer , The official answer , Was the one I would want her to hear . I think you saw what you saw . Just as you saw what you saw . When can I start ? I used to babysit for this family five years ago . They were loaded . You said you moved here two years ago from michigan . They usually hide a key here somewhere . Sweet ! you are jacked , girl . Look for cash and jewelry . Check this out . Saw the lady open it . I memorized the ... Combination . Just put it all in the bag . What are these ? Whatever. just put ' em back . They 're the same as the necklace you gave me . Because I stole it when I worked here . You said , " i got it at this awesome thrift store In echo park . " Tell me about the necklace . Why are you making such a big deal out of this ? Tell me about the necklace . I didn 't buy it or steal it , okay ? It 's mine . This is ... my parents ' house . You lied to me . I told you where the camp was . You told me your sister gave you that bracelet . What does that have to do with anything ? We found these on some of your friends . Why are you all wearing them ? It has something to do with the connor camp.-No. It 's a pass . To get in the camp . You were going to send me there without it . They would have known what I was . You lied to me . I 'll never help you get to john connor . You already did . You lied to me . I 'm from l.a. , okay ? Let 's go . Tell me who you are . I went to cal arts for two years , And I got kicked out , which was for the best , Because that place is a ... factory . And my parents cut me off like yours , And just pretend I don 't exist . We have to go. now . Why ? Because there 's a silent alarm , And we tripped it when we walked in . You weren 't going to tell me . The police are gonna be here any second . You were never going to portland . You were gonna run And leave me here to take the blame . No . You lied to me . You lied to me . I 'll never help you get to john connor . No , no , no. what did you do ? What did you do ? We have to go . John . We have to go . Did you kill her ? Apparently not . Where 's trevor ? He was called into work . Be back tomorrow to take you home . What 's wrong ? It wasn 't him that freaked out . It was me . When I found out I was pregnant . Cop thing. he told me . Yeah. cop thing . It 's kinda cool and sexy When you 're a 25-year-old pastry chef Making gourmet doughnuts At this hip cop hangout in silverlake . When you think about breast-feeding your baby boy Next to the walkie and the .9 millimeter ... Still ... He 's a good man . He 'll be a good dad . Kacy , I have to tell you something . That story about john 's birth , It wasn 't true . The jungle ? No , that part was true . The part about his father wasn 't . He wasn 't there with me . He died before john was born . Before I even knew I was pregnant . Why did you tell me that story ? Cause I wished it 's the way it could have been . That 's the saddest thing I 've ever heard . The thing is , I got through it . All of it. by myself . And so can you . Besides , you won 't be alone . I 'll be right next door . That was my last get out of jail free . Damn right . Where 'd you get that ? I got it at this awesome thrift store In echo park .

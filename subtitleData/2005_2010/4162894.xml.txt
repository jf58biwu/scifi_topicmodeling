 28 Weeks Later ( 2007 ) 25 fps - What are you gonna cook ? - Your favourite . What , again ? - Well , this is the last one . - What , you mean no more tomatoes ? You can never have enough tins of tomatoes , eh ? Instead ... we 've got five tins of chickpeas . That should last at least five year , eh ? - Fancy a glass of wine ? - Yeah , that 'd be great . We 're in luck . Drinkable . - You all right , sweetheart ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Well , I 'm not fine , it 's all fucked , but ... - Our children are safe , aren 't they ? - Totally . Yeah . Thank God we paid for that school trip . Imagine if we hadn 't ! I can 't . I can 't imagine . I can 't imagine . And I don 't want to imagine . I don 't ... Listen , they 're far , far away . And they 're safe and sound . OK ? - Yeah . - Yeah . OK . Don 't worry ... gorgeous . Not interrupting , am I ? No . I found this in the cellar . I 'd forgotten all about it . I thought we could have them after dinner . Yeah . - It smells wonderful . - And is that a bottle of wine , Don ? - It is indeed , Geoff . - Thank you . There 's chocolate for after , courtesy of your good wife . What have we here ? I get blackberries . Vanilla . Notes of autumn . Karen ? He 'll be hungry . When he gets back he 'll want something to eat . - Here we go again . - Jacob , no . Let me tell you something . It 's five days since your boyfriend ran out on us . If he 's still breathing , he won 't be interested in pasta . Jacob ! - It 'll be your fucking neck ! - Don 't say that ! - Out of order , Jacob . - Why ? We all know it 's true . The sooner she faces it , the better . There are no survivors . It 's just us in here and them out there . - Sam ? - Quiet ! - God , it 's a boy . - Wait , wait . You don 't know who 's out there . - Please , let me in ! - Don , it 's a kid ! Help ! Let me in ! Bloody hell . - Please ! Please , let me in ! - We 're coming . Let me in ! Please ! Help ! Let me in ! Please ! Get in . Come on , get in . Come here . - Are you all right ? Are you all right ? - Yeah . - Where have you come from ? - Sandford . Sandford 's upriver a few miles . - How did you get here ? - They were chasing me . Screaming . I was scared . I ran . I tried other houses . They were empty . I came through the woods and I followed the river until I got here . - Who were chasing you ? - My mum . My dad . They 're trying to kill me . - There 's others , too . - How many ? - Loads . - Sam ? - It 's got me ! It 's got my arm ! - Karen , no ! Help me ! Alice ! Get outta here ! Get down the escape hatch , go ! Go ! - Geoff , I can 't see . I can 't see ! - Hold onto my hand ! Die , you fucker ! Die ! Come back ! Oh , God ! Keep going . Follow Jacob . Keep going . Sally , there 's no time . - We can 't leave them ! - Sally , come on ! Go ! Oh , no ! Shit ! Fuck ! Where are you ? - Where are you ? - Alice ! Alice , no ! Alice ! Geoff , come on ! Come on ! Geoff ! Sally , give me your hand . Give me your hand , Sally ! No ! Jacob ! Help me ! Alice ! Alice ! - Where are you ? - Come on ! Leave him ! - I see him there ! - Leave him ! Let go ! Quick ! Don ! Help us ! Don ! Don ! Get in there ! Don ! Don ! Don ! Jacob ! Come on ! Jacob ! Dear God ! Jacob ! Jacob ! Oh , fuck . Oh , shit . Oh , shit . Oh , shit . Oh , shit . Welcome to London . Hey , Doyle , you having fun down there ? You can kiss my ass . This is the worst combat I ever saw . Where 's the combat ? I hear you . - Give me something to shoot . - Too easy . North-east of med centre , 20th floor , three windows in . - Fat guy jerking off in the toilet . - Oh , bug-nuts . Him again . I don 't see him . Where is Fester Fucknut ? His dick in his hand on the 20th floor . Next to the fire exit . I think he needs ajerk-off extender . Doyle , you 're the expert in hand-to-hand combat . - Man-to-man combat . - Shut up . - Think it might be your dad , Doyle . - You got me . Shit . - Colonel Phillips here . What is your status ? - Good morning , Colonel . - Morning . - I 'm watching the new arrivals disembark . Yes , Major ? - It 'll take all morning to process them . - Copy . No one told me that we 're now admitting children . Just follow around to your right . Green and brown . Interesting iris variation . It 's usually hereditary . Do one of your parents have the same ? My mother . She did . - How old are you , Andy ? - 12 . I think that makes you the youngest person in the country . Well , your blood pressure is A-OK and you 're negative on any serious diseases or afflictions . I think you 're OK to come in . Welcome back to Britain . We are headed for our area of security and reconstruction designated as District One . District One is located on the Isle of Dogs . Although the Isle of Dogs is completely safe , the surrounding area of London is not . Large numbers of bodies are still not cleared from the original outbreak of infection . Rats and wild dogs are prevalent , as is disease . New arrivals are reminded for their own safety it is absolutely forbidden to cross the river and leave the security zone . You will be joining 15,000 civilians who are already resident in District One . As we approach your new home , you 'll notice a dramatically increased military presence . The US Army is responsible for your safety . We will do everything we can do to make your repatriation as easy as possible . Inside District One , however , we believe you 'll be pleasantly surprised . We have hot and cold running water , 24-hour electricity , a medical centre , a supermarket and even a pub . We 're nearly home . - Dad ! Dad ! - It 's Dad ! Come on . - Are you excited ? - Yeah . I missed you so much . Are you all right ? Are you all right ? Guys . I never thought I 'd see you again , you know that ? Let 's get something to eat . I should have been notified before children were brought in . We 've not established the protocol for minors . We have issues of disease and sanitation . We don 't fully understand the virus yet . We understand that it did not manage to go cross-species , that it did not manage to go airborne and that the last infected human died six months ago . - We weren 't here six months ago . - Major . - What are you afraid of ? - What if it comes back ? - It won 't come back . - What if it does ? If it comes back , we kill it . Code Red . Come on , guys . What about this place , then , Andy ? Yeah , it 's pretty good , Dad . Look at the camera . This way . Come through . It 's 25 floors . We 've got the penthouse up there . Believe me . ID , sir . Thank you . - So , what do you do here , Dad ? - What do I do ? I 'm a section officer . I keep the lights on , the water running , the heat running . See this ? Look . That says triple A - " access all areas " . That 's me . I basically run the place , you know . No . You 're the caretaker really , aren 't you ? No , I run the place . Like it ? - It 's amazing ! - Even better than sunny Spain ? You ought to have seen the camps . There were 20 in each tent and chemical toilets . - Everything smelled of piss . - Nice . We 'll be moving to a new house soon . A couple of months , in fact . A new house ? Yeah . Listen , I hope you guys understand . We 're not gonna be able to go back to our old house . It 's outside the security zone and I don 't think I 'd want to go back there , even if I could . What happened , Dad ? To Mum ? Yeah . Yeah . Do you wanna sit down and I 'll tell you all about it ? Your mum and I were hiding in a house . A wee cottage . It was an old couple that owned it and they were there , too . Three other people . And we were ... just trying to stay alive , I suppose . We were doing OK for a while . And then we were attacked . They came in through the kitchen window . They were really fast , you know . Chased us . Chased your mum . And we were trapped . Trapped in the bedroom . Don ! And I see ... I see them ... biting her . I couldn 't do anything . I tried to go back . She was already gone . She was already gone . Was there nothing you could do ? No , there was nothing I could do . I managed to get away . Just running , running , running ... I got to this military camp . And you know the rest . You know I 've been in quarantine waiting for you to come back . We 're just happy you 're still alive . I 'm sorry . Doyle ... - Doyle , you bastard . - Boy , I 've never seen you get so white . - Fuck you . - Good morning . Yeah , fuck outta here , man . I 'm having all good dreams . Sunday afternoon , clear blue skies , I 'm laying in bed with my wife ... And now I 'm back in this shithole . - I know . - Yeah ? I had that same dream about your wife . - Quit fucking with me . - Get outta here . - All right . Next time I 'm gonna shoot you . - All right . See you later , family man . I told you , I 'm gonna shoot you . What 's on the TV tonight ? Are you OK ? Bad dream ? I get worried I 'm gonna forget what she looks like . You won 't forget . I don 't even have a picture of her . You won 't forget . Promise ? Yeah . Andy , we agreed . You heard what they said . It 's only dogs and rats out there . We 'll get what we want and come back again . - We should 've told Dad . - It 's fine . Trust me . They won 't even know we 're gone . Where are you going ? Base , come in . We have two strays who slipped out the north gate . - Stray dogs ? - No , puppies . - Yeah ! - Yeah ! Yes ! Yeah ! London 's mine ! That 's what we need . Yeah , if it had keys . Wait here . Let 's go . There you go . Tam ! Tam ! Tam ? Tammy , are you there ? Tam ? Tammy ! Tammy ! Tammy , this is stupid . You 're not being funny . I knew it . You 're hurting me ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No , don 't go ! No ! No ! No ! Doyle . I got your puppies . No ! Get off me ! Get off me ! I apologise for these precautions . It 's standard protocol with any survivors , though we haven 't had to do it for a while . The last survivor we came across was over two months ago . Can you tell me anything about how you managed to keep alive while you were gone so long ? Do you know of any other survivors ? OK . I 'm just going to take a blood sample . It won 't hurt . Have you come into direct contact with the infected ? OK . I want to see my children . Of course . Of course . - Mr Harris . - Yeah . - We 've found your kids . - Oh , thank God . Thank you so much . We found your wife , too . Can they hear me ? - So , what do you two think you 're playing at ? - You said you saw her die . - What ? - You said you saw her die ! - I didn 't say that . - You did . You did . Baby , I didn 't use those words . This is ... I don 't know . I mean , it 's confusing , you know . It 's ... it 's very hard for you to imagine , you know ? - I ... It 's too hard to explain . - Well , try to explain it , Dad ! Try ! Try ? What do you want me to say ? I thought I saw Mum ... die . Or I wouldn 't have told you that . I was sure . Look , guys , I 'm not sure what 's happening here ... but it 's good . OK ? That 's the point . Mum 's alive . I want to see her ! There 's no question , sir . She has the virus . She 's infected . Why isn 't she showing any symptoms ? - I don 't know . - Speculate . A genetic abnormality which acts as some sort of natural immunity ? But the virus is still in her blood and saliva , so technically she 's not immune . She 's a carrier . She has the ability to infect others ? Yes , sir . Absolutely . If this woman has natural immunity she is incredibly valuable . Her blood could contain the key to a vaccine , even a cure . Alice . Hey , baby . Oh , I 'm so sorry . I was scared . I shouldn 't have run away . I was scared . Please forgive me . Please , sir . We need time to study her . We need to run some tests . You can run tests on her corpse , Major . I love you , Don . Yeah . Oh , God , I love you , too . Don ! Clear channels to control room . Control room , this is General Stone . All forces under my control , prepare to execute Code Red on my command . - Affirmative . - Affirmative . Break , break , break , all stations . Sunray in 30 seconds . We have an outbreak in the med centre . All units , safeties off . - Affirmative . - Open air cav transmission . - Prepare containment areas . - Move civilians to containment areas . Command personnel secure in bunker . Confirm order to lock down . Lockdown confirmed . Execute Code Red . Flynn , come in . Flynn , do you hear that Code Red or am I losing my shit ? I was about to ask the same thing . Ten-hut ! Everything 's fine . Don 't worry . I 'll be back in a moment . - It 's probably nothing . - Tam , it didn 't sound like nothing . He said he 'd be back in a moment . Are you OK ? Let 's go . Come on . - Move , move , move ! Let 's go ! - Andy , keep hold of my hand . OK , come on . Keep it moving . Come on , people . Come on . - Don 't push . - Sir , all civilians into the containment area . These kids are with me . It 's important they are kept protected . I need to get them out of here . - Sir , no exceptions . It 's a Code Red . - I know what it is . My name is ... - Andy ! - Scarlet ! Andy ! - Tammy ! - Andy ! - Andy , wait ! - Scarlet ! - Just wait , Andy ! We 're coming ! - Calm down . Calm down , now . Move down . Move down the room . Keep moving . Go , go , go . Come on . - You think it 's a drill ? - Of course not . Someone saw an infected . Keep moving . That 's it . Good , good . Let 's go . - Why are you sealing us inside ? - For your protection . - Just guard the door . Don 't lock it . - It 's for your own protection . - We 've got to find Andy . - We 'll find him . - Shut down civilian areas . - Sector one , lockdown . - Sector eight , lockdown . - Sector three , lockdown . Switch to emergency lighting . Use of non-lethal force authorised . All snipers in position . - Ground forces to med centre . - Ground force to med centre . Sector one covered . Everyone , stay calm . Dad . No ! My dad ... my dad ! He 's in here ! No ! Containment area , containment area , move into position . No ! I confirm , only target infected . Roger that . Only target infected . Targeting right . I 've had two down . Watch out for the friendlies . I can 't get a shot . Oh , man , this is FUBAR . We got a group there at 12 o 'clock . - We 've got one at three o 'clock . - On the ground , got four . 16 down . I got two by the Jeep . - Jesus . - I don 't see who 's a target . On the move ! On the move ! Moving right ! Moving right ! I can 't find the designated target here . I cannot be target-specific . Whisky Three , why have you stopped firing ? Come in . Abandon selective targeting . Shoot everything . Targets are now free . We 've lost control . All units , all units , this is Medical Commanding Officer Sierra Lima . Please be on the lookout for a young boy , age 12 , name , Andy . If he is located he must be immediately evacuated from the containment zone . We have to find Andy . - We have to find him ! - It 's OK . It 's OK . We 're gonna find him , OK ? We 're gonna find him , I promise . I 'm gonna get him out of here . I 'm gonna get you both out of here . Trust me . - New shot . - Abandon selective targeting . - Confirm order ? - Target everyone at ground level . No exceptions . Repeat , no exceptions . Come on ! Three down . One of ours down there . Three o 'clock . - Taking them down . - Left sector , three o 'clock . Kid ! Over here ! Kid ! Over here ! - I got him . - Well , take him out . Take him out . Doyle , I got two fuckers on me ! Fuck . Fuck . Fuck ! Tam ? This is madness . - What 's happening ? - They 're shooting everybody . - Why ? It makes no sense . - It makes perfect sense . It 's Code Red . I saw Dad . Where ? He 's one of them . Step one , kill the infected . Step two , containment . If containment fails ... step three , extermination . Now they won 't stop until everyone is dead . So what do we do ? I mean , I 'm not sitting around here to get exterminated . We 've gotta get outta here . If we take one step out of that door , if the infected don 't get us , the snipers will . Well , you don 't have a choice , my friend . Right now it 's dark out there . The snipers can see you through their night scopes , but at least you have some limited cover from the infected . But , you know , if you wanna wait till sun-up then you 're as good as dead . Who are you ? Sergeant Doyle . Delta rooftop unit . Why aren 't you at your post ? Why aren 't you ? Look , you guys do what you want , but I 'm gonna get the fuck outta here . You coming ? All right , come on . - Less shooting . - Maybe it 's under control . Or there are less shooters . All right , listen . I need you guys to look at me and only me , OK ? You run when I run . Be my shadow . That 's it , all right ? Get around back . Watch her . Ready ? Let 's go . Stay . Doyle , come in . - Flynn , go . - Doyle , where the fuck are you , man ? - Ground level , District One . - Shit . Close frequency . Copy that . What the fuck are you doing there ? You got some serious shit coming your way . - We already got some serious shit . - I 'm not playing . This is worse . The air cav just got their orders . They 're firebombing all of District One . - That was fast . - Outbreak is out of control . They 're taking no chances . So unless you are out of the target zone , you are getting cooked . - How long we got ? - They 're on their way . Four minutes , tops . But listen . I got some clear landing ground at Regent 's Park . That 's the pick-up point . - I 'll be back in touch . - Doyle , you fucking better be . All right , look , guys , we gotta run . Just stay low and stay fast , OK ? After me . Let 's go . - Snipers ! Get down ! Snipers ! - Back ! Back ! Back ! Get back ! Get back ! Andy , get back ! - Back ! - Andy , get in ! - Shit . - Fuck ! It 's OK . It 's just a flesh wound . Multiple shots , one hit . He 's a panicker , no marksman . OK . - What 's your name ? - Sam . OK , Sam . Come here . Get closer . Do you see that doorway ? I need you to run as fast as you can in a zigzag like this , OK ? Don 't stop for anything . - You want me to be bait ? - He 'll take shots at you , but he 'll miss . He 's gonna expose his position . Means I get a shot at him . I won 't miss . - You 're out of your fucking mind . - Stay back . Two minutes , we 're all gonna die . You want that ? No ! Andy ! Fuck ! Good work , kid . - The fence ! - Watch it , watch it . Behind me . Go ! Go ! Go ! Come on . Come on , come on . Jump ! This is Red Fox One pouring whisky . Keep going ! We 'll be safe under the river . Go ! Go ! Come on . Come on ! Run ! Run ! Bring in biological units . Fan out from predesignated positions . Bio units , copy . Use of chemical weapons authorised . Repeat , chemical weapons are authorised . Stay close . They left us again . Do you think Mum 's still alive ? Not this time . - You look a little pale . - Blood makes me nauseous . You never answered my question . About why you left your post . When I got that boy in my sights . That 's not a target any more . When we were separated ... I thought I 'd lost you , too . We won 't get separated again . We 'll stay together , whatever happens . Whatever happens . It was all fucked . You could hear it all over the radios . Fucked . Anyway , what about you ? - Why the hell are you here ? - Their mother had very special blood . A natural kind of immunity to the virus . Not all genetic traits are passed on , you know . They can skip a generation or vanish altogether , but ... But they might have it . It 's a possibility . So their lives are far more valuable than mine . Or yours . I got it . Doyle ! Doyle ! - Flynn , go . - You made it ! I knew you 'd do it . Listen . I 'm coming to you right now , but keep a lookout . There 's sightings of infected that have escaped the firebombing . - Give me an ETA . - About 60 . - Minutes ? - No . Seconds . All right , kids . Come on . Get down . Down ! Down ! I see you . I 'm coming in . Jesus , Doyle , you got people with you . Who the fuck are those people ? Doyle ! Who the fuck are those people ? I can 't take ' em . We will be shot out of the sky if I try to land at the base . No , no , don 't take ' em to base ! Take ' em over the Channel ! - What ? - We gotta get these kids outta here . Get the fuck in , Doyle ! I 'm not taking ' em ! - Get me out of here ! - Sam , come back ! Hey , get the fuck off there ! Get that fucker off my ski ! - OK , you wanna fly with me , asshole ? - Sam ! Come on ! Fuck ! We 're gonna die down here ! Do something ! You wanna fuck ? Come on , you fuckers ! Get up ! Run ! Move it ! Don 't look back ! Keep going ! Keep going . Fuck you , pussy ! Doyle , come in ! Doyle ! You need to get to safe ground . Get to the stadium . Ditch those people . I 'm not taking ' em .

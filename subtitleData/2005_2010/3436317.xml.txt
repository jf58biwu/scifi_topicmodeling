Can you just stop the car , please ? - Ma 'am . I am not under arrest . You can 't do this . This is a matter of national security . - You 're just gonna have to- - - National security ? Well , that just means whatever you want it to mean . I 'm just asking you to tell me why I 'm needed , or to let me go . Ma 'am , I can 't tell you why you 're needed because I don 't know . - But I know they need you and I know it 's urgent . - How do you know that ?

Make your way directly across the court yard to the main barracks . - Helen . - Hi , Michael . - Been a long time . - Are you behind all this ? Yes . Glad you came . - I didn 't have a choice . - Sorry about that . I had you put on the vital list . Thought it was important to have you as part of this team . - Why ? - I 'm keeping up with the work that you 've been doing with Professor Barnhardt . What does that have to do with this ? I 'll have to crash-brief you in the conference room . Object 07 / 493 was first spotted just beyond Jupiter 's orbit by the Spaceguard Program . It was notable for the fact that it was not moving in an asteroidal ellipse . but rather it had a hyperbolic orbit and was shooting through our solar system . The object - it 's moving at speed still up to 3 times 10 of the 7th meter per second . At first it was projected to pass millions of miles outside of Earth 's orbit . However , we soon discovered that the object was not following a gravitationally free fall trajectory . As such its path was recalculated . IMMINENT COLLISION This time a crisis response team was activated and everything you see around you is set in motion . IMPACT LOCATION MANHATTAN Couldn 't we launch a missile to intercept it ? The military is attempting to do just that . In fact , they may launch several . But given the speed at which this object is moving , our chances of success are slim at best . Then why don 't we evacuate the area ? We simply do not have enough time . The affected area contains some 8 million inhabitants . The best we can do is to plan for the aftermath . How long do we have ? 78 minutes . Hey . What did the cops want anyway ? Well there is gonna be a big storm tonight . And they needed some scientists to help out . You know ... Planning stuff . So ... Pretty soon you 're all gonna go down to the basement , okay ? - I already told Isabelle . - I haven 't seen anything on TV- - Jacob , just ... just do it , all right ? - All right . I should go . - Wait . Could we talk just a little bit longer ? We 're having dinner and I really should go . - You know I love you very much . - Okay . Bye , Helen . Is that a cell phone ? Can I borrow it ? What are the odds of an asteroid making impact in Manhattan ? Astronomical . Plus there is no light signature . Then it can 't be an asteroid . - A primordial black hole perhaps . - What ? Do you know what that would mean ? Look , whatever it is , if this object is moving at 3 times 10 to the 7th meters per second , there will be no aftermath . If they can 't stop it before it hits , there will be nothing left but dust . It will destroy the Earth . This is all theater . - They say we lost launch capabilities . - What ? ! - What 's that mean ? - The missiles are disabled . - Disabled by what ? - We don 't know . But they 're gonna restart it , right ? There 's a fallback . They have to launch . Object impact in 7 . 6 . 5 . 4 . 3 . 2 . 1 . - Where is it ? - Did they make a mistake ? Wait . Roger that . They say the object 's still in its approach . Well , then where is it ? - Slowing down . - Slowing down ? I see it . The radiation level is slightly elevated . But it 's not dangerous . - I 'm getting a lot of electrostatic interference . - Me too . Did you feel that ? Feel what ? I feel it . It 's close . * * * 06 . Who has tactical plan ? State district 4917 . I need to know who has jurisdiction on this site . What the hell is that there ? Should we engage ? Cease fire ! All stations cease fire ! Cease fire ! Don 't shoot ! Do not shoot ! We need a medic . Get a DNA swab . A DNA swab now ! What 's the O2 stat ? Give me an O2 stat . Go ! No one else ! - What are we supposed to do now ? - Here ! - Should we start an IV ? - No , no , no . We don 't know his physiology . - For all we know , the fluids might kill it . - What do I do then ? - What do I do ? - Its blood is red . It must have hemoglobin . - She is right . Start the drip . - Okay . I can 't find a vein . - It doesn 't have any veins . - Look for a central line site then . It 's going into a cardiac arrest . - Yeah . Now Go ! Go ! Clear ! - Why did it shorted out . - Heart rate is stabilizing . It 's stabilizing . What now ? What now ? Do you have a surgeon ? Normally , for a gunshot we 'd be using a general anesthetic . But as we don 't know how the patient will react , I have opted for a local . I 'm making the first incision now . No explosions . So far so good . Pale flesh . The texture something came to what ... Whale blubber . I 'm taking a specimen now . Let 's pack that on ice and chopper to the geonomics lab for DNA mapping . I 'd like a sample of that as well . I am entering the wound . And ... Oh , my god . What is this ? I 'm sorry . I 'm a little taken aback . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing is wrong . That 's the thing . It 's all so familiar . The outer layer of the flesh is exotic . It 's strange , but it 's like deeper it 's muscle , vein , nerve , bone . I 'm extracting the bullet . This gray flesh . It seems to be just falling away . It 's ... it 's removing itself . I think I need to keep extracting it . Yes . Continue . Can you explain any of this ? It 's dreaming . Any signs of neural activity ? It lit up the FMRI like Times Square . Get help . Code White . Subject is conscious . Help ! It 's looking at you , so try saying something to it . My name is Dr. Helen Benson . We are trying to help you . You have nothing to fear from us . Help you . Nothing to fear . Global markets are panicked in early trading this morning in response to the crisis in Central Park . Trading has been halted on the New Your Stock Exchange , the Nikkei and the Hang-Seng as Manhattan prepares for a massive evacuation . In other cities around the world people are voluntarily evacuating population centers , fearing that the sphere in Central Park may be the vanguard of an impending alien attack . The President and the Vice President have been taken to separate and secure locations . Until this situation has some kind of resolve , I am the eyes and ears of the presidency . So , what do we know ? Madam Secretary , we lost contact with one of our DSCS3 listening satellites orbiting Earth . What is that image ? You 're saying that sphere in Central Park isn 't the only one ? In fact , we have intelligence that said small spheres have landed at other locations around the world . - Different sizes . - General , where exactly are these spheres right now ? I think we 're asking the wrong questions . What questions should we be asking ? - Well , let 's start with this : where is our satellite ? - We lost contact with it . In the scheme of things , the loss of one satellite isn 't necessarily- - DSCS3 stands for Defense Systems Communication Satellite . Remember what it communicates with ? They were able to access our defense mainframe via that satellite . That 's how they temporarily shut down our missile defenses and entered our air space . - We have changed all the codes . - And on top of that there is a vast amount of vital intelligence on that mainframe . They know everything about us now . While we know nothing about them . Almost nothing . The fact that they chose to disable our defenses tells us something about their intentions . Madam Secretary , we brought in several specialists to analyze the tissue samples we harvested from the being . This is our chief geneticist , Dr. Hideo Hicovaga . This is our chief astrobiologist , Dr. Helen Benson . Hello . Doctor . The being is in a nascent state . The DNA samples we 've taken seem to represent three distinct life forms . Three different DNA types ? Yes , including the being 's brain . The body tissue is human , as far as we can tell . The gray flesh encasing it is organic material . Some kind of bio-engineered space suit . What it resembles hardly enough is placental tissue . Which makes sense given the placenta is a life-support system . and that basically in order to survive in our environment the being had to be born here . In its human form . They must have come here in the past and obtained the DNA sample from a human subject . Now , since that birth the being 's growned exponentially . This is one hour after surgery . This is three hours . Six hours . How much can you tell us about it by decoding its DNA ? You don 't understand . These are the Dead Sea Scrolls . Geneticists are gonna be studying this code for generations . No , they aren 't . This code is the property of the US government . Its very existence is classified . I wanna see it . Water . Bring him up . Does it actually speak our language or does it just parrot what it 's heard ? No . It seems to already understand our language . They compromised our satellites . They know everything about us . Mr. Driscoll . My name is Regina Jackson . I 'm the Secretary of Defense of the United States of America . This body will take some getting used to . I 've been sent here to determine who or what you represent and what your intentions are . It feels unreal to me . Alien . It 'll take time to adapt . What were you before you were human ? Different . Different how ? It would only frighten you . Do you have a name ? Klaatu . Do you represent a civilization ? I represent a group of civilizations . Where is this group of civilizations ? All around you . - What is your purpose in coming here ? - There is a gathering of world leaders not far from here . I will explain my purpose to them . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . Perhaps you should explain yourself to me instead . - Do you speak for the entire human race ? - I speak for the President of the United States . Now please , tell me . Why have you come to our planet ? Your planet ? Yes . This is our planet . No . It is not . We decided to sedate him and move him to a more secure location . - Are you going to interrogate him ? - That 's a possibility . Madam Secretary , as scientists we can 't consent to this . He says he wants to speak to the UN . History has lessons to teach us about first encounters between civilizations . As a rule , the less advanced civilization is either exterminated or enslaved . I 'm thinking of Pizzaro and the Incas . Columbus and the Native Americans . The list goes on . Unfortunately , in this case the less advanced civilization is us . This is a representative of an extraterrestrial civilization . This is the most important discovery in the history of mankind . It may well be the last discovery in the history of mankind . We need to know what they 're planning . And we need to know now . So you wanna drug him ? Interrogate him ? I 'm sorry we won 't do that . Do you understand ? I understand it completely . Of course , if you won 't do it , we 'll have to call in someone who will . - Well , I 'm sure you can find someone who will- - - I 'll do it . Helen . I 'll do it . H2O SALINE SOLUTION That won 't be necessary , doctor . We already prepared the solution for you . I just need a syringe . I wanna apologize to you . Seems we got off to a bad start . It seems we did . We are going to transport you to a different facility . With better medical care . No , you are not . - Excuse me ? - I am leaving . - I can 't allow you to do that . - It is not up to you . This is a military installation . You are surrounded by hundreds of soldiers . There 's no leaving here . I have done nothing wrong . You invaded our air space . That automaton that emerged from the sphere . It attacked our troops . It acted to defend me . It activates in the presence of violence . Dr. Benson , please . Run . It 's done . You 'll come with us , ma 'am . Keep moving . I 'm going to ask you a series of control questions . Are you currently in a seated position ? Yes . Are you human ? My body is . Do you feel pain ? My body does . Are you aware of an impending attack on planet Earth ? You should let me go . I 'll repeat the question . What gate did you use to enter this base ? - East loading door . - How do I get there ? - 100 yards left from the back of this building . - Is there a security code ? 44B30 . What size is that suit ? 42 long . Take it off . I 'm leaving you now . No . Put every arm of the government - military , law enforcement - federal , state and local on high alert . - If the media gets word of- - - Use a cover story . We can 't risk a panic . Call him an escaped convict . Use every surveillance satellite . Every drone aircraft . Every freeway camera . Use every resource we 've got . Excuse me . Excuse me . TUNA SALAD Don 't push me . - Just give me that ticket . - I 'm not giving you anything . Give me the ticket . What 's the matter with you ? Call an ambulance . Leaders around the world criticize the US response to the arrival of the spheres . Reactions from national and international religious communities have been varied . While some of them respond in cold and measured optimism , most religious communities have considered recent events to be apocalyptic . There are gatherings and rituals in virtually every major city . Many see the arrival of the Central Park sphere as a sign of Evil or perhaps even the end of the world . Leaders around the world are protesting the US 's decision to deny foreign scientists full access to the being . - Have you done your homework ? - School 's cancelled on account of the aliens . - They say it 's an invasion . - Well , they are wrong . - What makes you so sure ? - I just know . Don 't get that ! - Jacob ! - Hallo ? Can I speak to Dr. Helen Benson , please ? It 's for you . - Hallo ? - Dr. Helen Benson ? Yes . I 'm calling from the Newark train station . We 've got your patient here . I 'm sorry . I think there 's been a mistake . I 'm not that kind of a doctor . Hold on a second . He says you got his medication . I 'll be right there . Excuse me ! Excuse me ! I 'm sorry . Somebody called me . My name is Dr. Benson . Good . He 's over there . He 's your problem now . Go ahead . Take him . You know I took a huge risk back at the hospital . Did I make a mistake ? - Are you a friend to us ? - I am a friend to the Earth . - Hello . - Hi . Okay . - Now what ? - Drive . Look in your pocket . Your inside pocket . Turn left . Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . - All right , everybody ! We got our mission . - All right . Target acquired and confirmed , sir . - We 're locked on . - Madam Secretary . They are sending in the drones . Bring in the reapers . We have a go . Roger that . Ascending to 12.000 . Let 's light this thing up . Arm the Sidewinder missiles . Roger that , Colonel . Sidewinder missiles armed . - He is activating . - Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! - Missiles intercepted . - Get outta there ! - Control , * * * . - Negative . I lost link . I 've lost control . Whose in control of the aircraft then ? I am out of control . Anyone got any other ideas ? Why are people running ? They should stay and fight . They didn 't come here to hurt us . Well , we should kill them anyway . Just to make sure . - Don 't say that . - That 's what dad would have done . - I think he would have looked for a different way . - He would have fought . - I 'd like to think I knew him pretty well . - I knew him , too . Longer than you . What do you think ? - Of what ? - Should people run ? Or should we stay and fight ? - Neither . - What should we do then ? There is nothing you can do . This is it . Pull in here . McDonald 's ? Where are you going ? - Jacob , where are you going ? - To the bathroom . Where is the boy 's father ? - He 's dead . - How did he die ? He was in the Army . So the boy wishes his soldier father were here to rescue the world from the aliens . The boy wishes his father were here for a lot of reasons . Aliens being the least of them . He wasn 't even that kind of a soldier . He was an engineer . He went over there to build . Not to fight . And his mother ? She died when he was a baby . I married his father . A year ago he was killed . Why did you come here ? I came to save the Earth . From what ? He 's here . Here is your tea , old man . Thanks . - Are you one of them ? - One of who ? Never mind . Sorry . You didn 't contact us for a long time . I have a secret mission . It is enemy territory . I understand . I guess they can come to an agreement . I am afraid they are unreasonable race . I 've been living here for 70 years . I know them well . And ? Every try to explain it to them was a failure . They ruin everything . And that shall never change . They ruin everything . And that shall never change . Is it your official point ? The trouble is they know their destiny . They can feel it . And can do nothing about it . That 's decided . I 'll begin the process ASAP . We need to prepare to leave . I am staying . You can 't stay here . I can and I will . - If you stay , you 'll die . - I know . This is my home now . - You yourself called them a destructive race . - That 's true . But still . There is another side . You see , I love them . This is a very strange thing . I can 't find a way to explain it to you . For many years I ... I cursed my luck for being sent here . Human life is difficult . But if this life is coming to an end ... I consider myself lucky . To have lived it . No sudden movements . No aggressive actions . No matter what happens , no gunfire . Truck is in place , sir . Container panels are in position . We are ready on your order . On my command . Move your panels into place . Three . Two . One . Container panels are secure . And ... we are still here . - 911 . What 's your emergency ? - The escaped convict they showed on the news . - I just saw the guy at a gas station . - Can you describe the vehicle ? - It 's a little car . - 911 . What 's your emergency ? - I just saw that wanted man over by McDonald 's . - Can you give me a description of the car , sir ? - A silver Ford * * * with a woman and a kid . - Every unit . Look for a silver Honda . This is it . Stop here . Should ... Helen , who is this guy ? - A friend . - What kind of friend ? Scooch over . He 's work friend . What 's his name ? - Klaatu . - Klaatu ? What kind of name is that ? It 's foreign . I think . - I never heard you talk about him before . - I haven 't known him for very long . We 're just giving him a ride . Where ? - Here ? - The forest ? Stay here . * * * lock the door , okay ? And don 't open it for anyone but me . I 'm serious . Helen . What 's going on ? We 're getting images of these spheres from all over the world . - Ocavango . Gobi . Baku . - Which of our agencies gathered this intel ? None of them . We pulled these off the Internet . Is that ... them ? No . It 's us . Those are ordinary cephalopods . Squid . Octopus . I don 't like him . He 's weird and why are we driving him around anyway ? It 's complicated . Is he coming home with us ? - No . No . - Well , what if you decide to like him and he wants to move in ? No , it 's not like that . God , no . Listen to me . - No one is moving in . You don 't understand . - Whatever . You wait for him . I 'm going home . Jacob . Jacob . Jacob ! What is the matter with you ? These spheres now appear to be leaving in the same manner as they came . Now the only sphere that doesn 't appear to be leaving is the giant sphere in Central Park . You think we scared them off ? They are not afraid of us . - I need to get back to the city . - Not until you tell me what 's going on . - Did you do that ? - Yes . Jacob . Get in the car . - He 's one of them . - Please get in the car . Get in the car . - I need to know what 's happening . - This planet is dying . - The human race is killing it . - So you 've come here to help us ? No , I didn 't . - You said you came to save us . - I said I came to save the Earth . You came to save the Earth . From us . - You came to save the Earth from us . - We can 't risk the survival of this planet for the sake of one species . - What are you saying ? - If the Earth dies , you die . If you die , the Earth survives . There are only a handful of planets in the cosmos that are capable of supporting complex life- - - You can 't do this . - This one can 't be allowed to perish . We can change . We could still turn things around . We 've watched , we 've waited and hoped that you would change . - Please . - It 's reached the tipping point . We have to act . - Please . - We 'll undo the damage you 've done and give the Earth a chance to begin again . Don 't do this . Please . We could change . We could change . The decision is made . The process has begun . Oh , God . It won 't make any difference , Helen . Even if they arrest me . Even if they kill me . The process will continue . Both of you , hands on the car ! Right now ! - Is that a child in the car ? - Yes . This is HP28 . I 'm on I67 . I have the FBI suspect in custody along with one adult female and one child . Awaiting instructions . Tell the child to get out of the car . - Get the kid out of the car ! - All right . Come . Okay , you two , over there . You . I 'm not gonna tell you again . Hands on the car ! Please , don 't hurt him . - I 'm not gonna hurt him so long as he- - - I wasn 't talking to you . The pain will only last a moment . - You killed him ! You killed him ! - Jacob . - You killed him ! You killed him ! - Let me finish . You killed him ! You killed him ! - Come , sit down . - You killed him ! You 'll be all right . I don 't understand . - You 're gonna kill us all . But you saved him . - He was an obstacle but I meant him no harm . - You could stop this , couldn 't you ? If you wanted to . - I tried to reason with you . - I tried to speak with your leaders . - Those aren 't our leaders . If you wanna speak to one of our leaders , I 'll take you to one . Let me take you . Get in the car . Maybe they are just collecting specimens from our planet . It 's not our planet . That 's what he said to me in the hospital . An ark . - Excuse me ? - It 's an ark . So are all the other spheres . They are saving as many species as they can . If the sphere is an ark , then what comes next is a ... The flood . Karl , we 're here . Let 's get you settled . KARL THOMAS BARNHARDT " Inventas Vitam Juvat Excoluisse Per Artes " It 's a Nobel Prize . He won it for his work in biological alterism . Probably still be in his desk drawer if I hadn 't gotten it framed for him . - You tired ? - Just a little . Close . But no . I wouldn 't . He won 't mind . He 's one of them . You shouldn 't be helping him . We should stop him . For just this once , I need you to trust me . Is it possible ? SPHERES LAND ACROSS THE WORLD ARMIES MOBILIZED I have so many questions to ask you . It 's Bach . It 's beautiful . So we 're not so different after all . I wish that were true . MT WEATHER FLASH FACILITY BLUEMONT , VIRGINIA - So , is it a machine or a living thing ? - It 's both . Or neither . What do you mean " neither " ? It seems to be some ort of silicon-based hybrid .

The problem is you . - You lack the will to change . - Then help us change . I cannot change your nature . You treat the world as you treat each other . But every civilization reaches a crisis point eventually . - Most of them don 't make it . - Yours did ? How ? Our sun was dying . We had to evolve in order to survive . Si it was only when your world was threatened with destruction that you became what you are now . Yes . Well , that 's where we are . You say we 're on the brink of destruction and you 're right .

Everywhere . - Dr. Benson . - Madam Secretary , please . I don 't wanna die here in this room without seeing my son one more time . Do you really think you can persuade him ? I think you should let me try . Go on then . But I make you no promises . I still answer to the President . - You 're on your own . - No , she 's not . I 'll go with you . - Good luck . - Thank you . It doesn 't work . Go ahead . It 's me . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . He 's right here . She wants to talk to you . Yes . I need to get back to the city . - Yes . - Tell her I know where we can meet her . I told Helen we should kill you . Yes , I heard that . I didn 't mean it , though . You didn 't ? Well , not anymore . So what 's gonna happen to us ? I was just wondering the same thing . - The end of the world ! - Good luck . This is it . This is where we 're supposed to meet her . Come on ! Hurry up ! It 's this way . You can do this . Just like with the trooper . - There are some things I can 't do . - But you have powers . I 'm sorry . Please . Please . Jacob . Nothing ever truly dies . The Universe wastes nothing . Everything is simply transformed . Just leave me alone . - It 's not fair . - No . No , it isn 't fair . He left me alone . Oh , baby . You 're not alone . And he didn 't leave you . I see him in you . All the time . All the time . Sometimes it 's hard for me to bear . Do you miss him , too ? So much . - I 'm sorry . - I 'm sorry . It 's all right . He 's here to help . There 's another side to you . I feel it now . Is that how it ends ? Yes . You can 't stop it ? I don 't know . - * * * . To you and your way of life . - But we can change . You know that now . Please . Please . Just give us a chance . I 'll try . I must get back to the city . Of course , Mr. President . I understand the situation . But with all due respect , sir , any further military action will only make things worse . I believe we may still be able to open a dialog . Yes , Mr. President . As you wish , sir . Thank you . - Checkpoint . - We can 't stop . There isn 't time . Stop ! Lincoln Bravo One to Lincoln Bravo Two . * * * Roger that , Bravo One . Bravo One . We 've got orders to let them through . Do you copy ? Roger that . They 're slowing down . Letting us through . Why ? Where is everybody ? They 've cleared the area . - Stop the car . - What ? Stop the car ! Jacob . - Jacob ! - I 'm okay . Michael ? Michael . We have to get to the sphere . Helen ! We won 't make it . We can 't keep them out for long . Mom . What 's happening to him ? Jacob . They 're inside him . He 's dying . Help him . Help him . Please . Your professor was right . At the precipice . We change . It 's leaving . No . He is leaving .

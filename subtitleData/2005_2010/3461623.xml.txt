 You . Hey , barbie . I got a message from someone named Rebel . Said you could help me . I need your help , barbie . Rebel promised . Well , he lied . Now get out . Please . I can 't go back out there . SANDRA : Claire ? You okay ? Oh , my God . Mom . It 's all right . Mr. Doyle here was just leaving . No , please . They 'll catch me . Rebel said you could help me start over , And that 's all I want : To go back to being a puppeteer , Making people happy . And you thought I would help you ? After what you did ? You should know there are agents parked outside this house . Actually , they 're not . Rebel set a fake call , which they 'll figure out any minute now . But if there were agents outside ... why aren 't they kicking in the door , looking to collect a comes-back-to-life barbie ? They gave me a free pass , But they will come after me if I try to help anyone . So you turn your back on your own kind , while we 're all out there being hunted down ? They burned down my theater while I was still inside . And you tried to kill us , you- - ! You and your free pass . You have no idea what it 's like to be hunted , to live on the street , to break into the home of the last person on earth you 'd expect to help you because she was your only hope . I thought ... Well ... I 'm not gonna force you to help me , Claire . That 's not who I am anymore . NATHAN : Where the hell have you been ? Dealing with the mess your brother left us . There wouldn 't have been a mess if you 'd released Parkman and Millbrook like I asked you to . DANKO : I made the right choice . Peter just got lucky . Though I have wondered how many people knew he was on that rooftop . [ Cell phone ringing ] Petrelli . What ? Yeah , I 'm on my way . I thought Parkman was in your custody . He was last time I checked . Then what the hell is he doing in front of the Capitol Building with a bomb strapped to his chest ? [ Police sirens approaching ] [ Tires screeching ] Oh no . No , no , no . MATT : Wait . Deactivate the device now , then lie face down . I don 't know , if I try and pull this it 's g- - I didn 't do this . I was set up ! - Hey . - Senator Nathan Petrelli . Sir , this is a very dangerous situation . I can 't- - Lieutenant , I know that man . I can get through to him . You got five minutes . Parkman ! You son of a bitch . Don 't you come any closer to me . - Everything gonna be all right . - No , it 's not ! You turned me into a terrorist . I didn 't sanction this . That was Danko . - You 're lying to me ! - He 's got an agenda . - You 're lyin ' to me ! - Believe me , Matt . Use your power . Read my mind . I 'm telling you the truth . I can 't . I can 't . They drugged me . You gonna have to trust me , Matt . Parkman 's vest is ready , sir , but we have a problem here . DANKO : Petrelli . How 'd he get there so fast ? - Is the device armed ? - We 're all set . The senator wants to play hero ... he can be a martyr to his own cause . Take them out . [ Beeping ] [ Beeping ] - Code confirmed , sir . - Do it . Take him out . Now . MATT : I don 't know where this came from ! [ Device beeping ] I 'm gonna blow up ! We 've been kicked out . Get it back . Now . [ On TV ] ... though there are those who believe that he may know the bomber personally . What 's goin ' on here ? Come on . We 're losin ' our window . I 'm routing through a different server . NATHAN : Matt , if we don 't disarm you , they 're gonna shoot you . There are a lot of bomb techs around here . I 'm sure one of them is thinking about how to disarm that . Get inside his head . MATT : The drugs are starting to wear off , but I don 't think I- - What 's he thinking ? [ Thoughts ] We 're running out of time . Red wire . - Red wire , red wire ! - Red wire . [ Thoughts ] It doesn 't make any sense . Why would a suicide bomber bother with dummy wire ? - Don 't touch red wire . - I 'm not touching anything . Senator , we have to take the shot ! Just hang on . It 's all right , Matt , take your time . [ Thoughts ] Black wire is the key . - Black wire , Black wire . - Black wire . Black wire ... Do I pull the black wire , or is that the one I don 't pull ? I don 't know . He 's not thinkin ' directly about it . I gotta dig deeper . Hold on ! OPERATOR : I got it . We 're back up . Weapon armed , sir . Get it off ! Matt , I 'm gonna pull it . - Do it . - Danko . I said do it . BENNET : No , wait ! Damn it ! Sorry , Matt . I can 't have you usin ' your power . [ Knocking ] MAN : It 's open . [ Coughing ] Almost got the order ready . You have a lot of pickups today ? I 'm not here for a pickup . No ? It 's me . Gabriel . Your son . Is that so ? That is so . What brings you all the way out here ? SYLAR : I had some questions about myself . Who I am , where I came from . But then I remembered . You abandoned me . You killed my mother . So ? What now ? Now ? I kill you . Go right ahead . You kill me , or the cancer does . Either way , I die . I haven 't got all day . DANKO : - Anything ? - This guy 's good . There 's no sign the system was even breached . I wanna know how the hell he 's getting inside , and I want a name . NATHAN : Me too . So I can thank them for saving us from this disaster . Of course , since the safety of your friends and family evidently trumps national security . Parkman wasn 't a threat until you strapped a bomb to him . Parkman and your brother exposed our operations , so I handled it , put a face to the terrorist threat . People could have died . People have died , Senator , or don 't my men count ? I was brought in to get this job done . I 'd let go of that if I were you . You 're relieved of command . I answer to the president . You try to get rid of me , he 's gonna want proof , and right now it 's my word against yours . Good luck getting any of my people to turn on me . We 'll see. excuse me . Bennet , you have a minute ? BENNET : I 'm not sure how much I can tell ya about what happened . NATHAN : I know what happened last night . I wanna talk to you about putting a team together once Danko 's gone . - You 're gonna head op- - NIKI : ( on TV ) - You 're one of us , Nathan . You 're one of us ! You 're one of us , Nathan . Do you have a point ? DANKO : That maybe this operation has been compromised from the start . The Petrelli family has a lot of skeletons in their closet , Senator . I think we both know what yours is . So ... looks like we 're both building a case against each other . Let 's see who gets there first . NIKI : ( on TV ) You 're one of us , Nathan . You 're one of us ! NATHAN : That son of a bitch went over my head . What did you expect ? You backed a wild dog into a corner . NATHAN : - I had to act . - But you didn 't act . All you did was show Danko your hand , and , frankly , you put both of us at risk . - I had planned it all out . - Nathan , listen to me . He 's pushing your buttons so that you 'll make a mistake . Take a play from your mother 's book . Keep your head . Sorry about all this . I find that hard to believe . The man who transferred you back here is gonna come in in a few moments and ask you some questions . I was wondering when that was gonna happen . I know this might seem hard to believe , but I still care about you . Well , that makes one of us . Come on. you 're smarter than that . You might not realize it , but I have been helping you out all along . You and everyone else . And doing a fabulous job of it . You remember when you jumped off the bridge and I was there ? I 'm still the same guy . You sacrificed me for your own personal gain . You don 't have to like me , But you do have to understand that I am your last hope . That 's my prisoner . You got a soft spot for this one , Petrelli ? Wanna make sure I don 't get too rough with her ? No , no . Knock yourself out . I wanna know everything you know about Nathan Petrelli . He was lousy in bed . [ Snorting ] I wanna know what you meant when you said he was " one of us . " Does Nathan have an ability ? An ability ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . You wanna talk about it ? [ Sighing ] Should I have helped Doyle ? That puppet man is a sick and twisted individual , Claire . You did the right thing . I have a free pass for a reason . I should be using it to help people . Rebel seems to think so . Yes , well , this rebel , whoever he is , can 't send psychopaths to our front doorstep . I don 't think I can take any more surprise guests . Right , which is why I was thinking that I should have a cover job . I mean , with Alex gone , they 're probably gonna need someone to fill his job at the comic book store , and I could help whoever Rebel sends , and no more surprise guests for you and Lyle . Boy , Claire , I don 't know . I guess so . If it 's what you want to do . Thanks . So , you don 't have any retail experience ? Um , does a cheerleading bake sale count ? Uh , you 're a cheerleader ? Yeah , I was . All right , so let me ask you a few questions . Can you work Wednesdays ? Wednesdays ? Wednesdays are when all the new comics arrive . Wednesday is good for me . Flight or invisibility ? I 'm sorry . What ? Do you throw caution to the wind and fly off to save the day , or do you take the more calculated approach and learn the whole picture before you act ? What 's the answer ? There isn 't one . That 's why it 's the question . Put simply - what type of hero are you ? I don 't know . Whoa , hey , hey . You 're not gonna cry , are you ? It-it 's okay , really . They 're only comic books , I mean ... I 'm gonna stop bothering you . Uh , thank you for letting me interview , anyway . What are you talking about ? You got the job . I did ? Every guy in the store 's been staring at you since you walked in . You will absolutely sell comic books , and the other stuff we can work on . You 're still here . [ Coughing ] This is pitiful . What 's that ? What you 've become . You used to be a killer . Now look at you . You 're pathetic . Oh . You want a fight . Is that what you were expecting ? Son kills his father ? Epic battle ? Ah , that 's a myth . No , life - [ Coughing ] Life never gives you what you want . Give me a hand with this . Maybe I can explain it to you . Now , when I open the trap , he 's gonna bolt , so grab him from the back , all right ? [ Cage door rattling ] [ Whistling ] [ Coughing ] You have an ability . Got lots of ' em . Don 't know what I got left . Been years since I used ' em , or needed ' em . You have the same thing , taking people 's abilities . Am I right ? [ Coughing ] Guess the apple didn 't fall too far from the tree . I 'm not your apple . You don 't know anything about me . I have some idea . You and I , we can 't be all that different . From where I stand , we have exactly nothing in common . Yeah , well , we pick easy targets . Like that rabbit . Weak , helpless . Not fair , really . Are you really drawing a moral line ? Morality doesn 't figure into it . Fish gotta swim , birds gotta fly . You have to kill . It 's who you are . But you do choose your prey , and yours never had a chance , not against you . Not really . Easy pickings . Small game . They had something I wanted . It isn 't my fault if they weren 't strong enough to fight back . [ Chuckling ] And those agents that have been comin ' after us recently ? - I handled them . - No , you ran away from ' em . Just like I did . I could wipe them out with a thought . But you haven 't . [ Chuckles and coughs ] Why ? You know , there 'll come a day , maybe tomorrow or next week , next year , When you realize the hunt your entire life , was meaningless and disappointing , cause there 's no challenge in it . You know , all the power in the world doesn 't matter if you 've lived an unsatisfied life . But I think you know that already , don 't you ? You wanna know more , or ... you gonna kill me now ? What do I do ? Gut him . DANKO : While you were at Primatech , did you come across anyone who could fly ? Plenty , but you know that . It 's in the files . I 'm guessing a few were missing . The facility burned to the ground . Who knows what was lost ? That must have been tough for you . 20 years on the job . I 'm sure you 'd grown close to the Petrelli family . The Petrellis were never exactly a warm and fuzzy bunch . You adopted the senator 's daughter . I didn 't know she was his at the time , and neither did he , for that matter . We both know Nathan Petrelli is hiding something . You know what question you should be asking yourself ? " Who would want to save Peter ? " His mother ? Angela ? BENNET : You wanna know what 's missing from the files ? Who can fly ? She 'd never betray her own son . A long time ago , I gave up trying to figure out what Angela Petrelli would or wouldn 't do . [ Phone ringing ] Go ahead . BENNET : We 've got a problem . Nathan 's made a power play against Danko . He 's stirred up a hornet 's nest . It 's nice to know a mother still has some influence over her son . Things will be better for us with Danko gone . Of course they will , but Nathan 's on thin ice . He 's moving too fast , and Danko 's unpredictable . The man nearly killed Peter . It had to be done . Be prepared then , 'cause I pointed him in your direction . Be careful . He does his homework . So do I. Homework . Thank you . See you tomorrow . - See you Claire . ALL : - Bye . Claire . You all right ? Everything okay at home ? Yeah . That 's not what this is about . I have a question , and I really need you to answer it . Okay . How did you lead two lives for all that time ? I can 't always be myself , and I just don 't know who I 'm supposed to be . Honestly , Claire , I 'm the worst person to ask . So how am I supposed to decide which path to take ? NOw which answer do you want ? Do you want the one Do you want the one that 's gonna make you feel better , or do you want the truth ? I don 't know . Well , then my answer is " neither do I. " Thanks . I miss you , Claire bear . [ Tires screeching ] [ Cell phone ringing ] Doyle ! Freeze ! Put your hands over your head . [ Panting ] Whatever you say . When are you gonna learn ? I have this effect on women . Doyle , I 'm giving you a chance to surrender . I should kill you ... but I just wanna go back to the way life was . [ gasping ] All right , Doyle . Ahh ! Barbie ... [ Quiet lounge music ] Mrs. Petrelli . My name is- - ANGELA : Mr. Danko . I was hoping you could help me . Well , everything I know about the people you 're after is in the Primatech files . I 'm not interested in files . Elle Bishop , Hiro Nakamura , Matt Parkman , all inherited abilities from their parents , as did Peter and Claire . Well , genetics is an extremely complex topic , Mr. Danko . Did you know that two blue-eyed parents can sometimes have a brown-eyed child ? So Nathan was the misfit ? Sometimes these things skip a generation . I don 't believe you . I 've met many men like you , Mr. Danko . Our company employed dozens of them . No family , nothing to hold you back . You operate in the shadows , doing all the awful things other people just refuse to do . That 's what makes you useful . And expendable . Really ? That incident in Angola ? 1997 , I believe . All those civilians lost . Tragic . I 'm surprised you survived , actually . You 're a very ... resourceful woman , Mrs. Petrelli . [ Slurping ] SYLAR 'S FATHER : A man needs a hobby , somethin ' to occupy the hands , to stop the mind from thinkin ' so much . I fix watches . Watches ? I thought it would make my father happy . [ Chuckling ] How 'd that work out for you ? You 're still clinging to that need for connection , huh ? The only thing people are good for is disappointment . Is that why you killed my mother ? Why you abandoned me ? I don 't even remember . Didn 't matter to me . So few things do . Well , now what ? Cut the thread . Go on . Ahh ! How 'd you do that ? It 's just an ability I picked up from a cheerleader in California . I guess not everybody gets old . Not everybody dies . Then you just have that much longer to suffer , don 't ya ? [ Coughing ] Get that . It needs to settle . Over there on that cabinet , if you don 't mind . Sure . What the hell are you doing ? It 's amazing how it comes right back , that desire , that hunger . You think this is gonna stop me ? You think you can beat me ? I want that power ! [ Whistling ] I thought you 'd given up . Yeah , well , me too . Then why bother ? What 's the point ? Immortality . You 're my second chance . At what ? Killing again ? You said it was meaningless . It was . Then why make the same mistake twice ? Because I 'll get it right this time , do more , be more , take every challenge , fight hard , risk it all , take real power , real authority , change everything - the world , just to see if I can . You can move . I can . [ Chuckling ] You 're the hunter . I thought you would know when someone was playing possum , when the prey isn 't so weak , so easy . [ Grunting ] [ Gasping ] ( croaking ) Please ... I need that power . I don 't wanna die . No , no , no , of course not . Of course you don 't . It won 't kill you if I take it . You 'll heal . You 'll be fine . Yeah , but so will you . No. don 't ... leave . Like I said , I came here to kill you . I got the answers I wanted . Now I know exactly what I need to do . Kill me . Oh , you 're gonna die . Slowly ... painfully ... and alone with your sickness . Please ... Don 't . I 'm sorry . You 're just small game . Turns out the President didn 't really need that much proof after all . It 's a signed document . You 're finished . You lose me , you lose the whole team . Well , that 's a risk I 'm prepared to take . In fact , anyone who 's not on board can step out now . You 're hitting reset on the whole operation just because of me ? Well , I think it 's time things were done correctly . You may have friends now , Petrelli , But one day you 're gonna find yourself all alone . You went to the President ? Mm-hmm , and he is eager to meet Danko 's replacement . You comin ' ? [ Elevator bell ] NATHAN : They say you 're the man with the plan . I sure hope you have something good to share with the president . It 's a bit unorthodox , but it 's tested . Look , it 's over . Just let it go . When are you gonna understand ? Bureaucracy , oversight , rules of conduct , None of it applies in my world . I don 't know what your world is , but it ought to be shut down . Hold , Danko , take it easy . I 've seen what these people can do , and it scares me . And the thing about you , Senator , is that through all this , you 've never once shown an ounce of fear , and I wonder ... Why is that ? I don 't have time for this . [ Gunshots ] [ Glass breaking ] Tell me you didn 't know about this . This is it . Your new identity , everything you need to start over . Rebel 's erased any trace of Eric Doyle . You saw me spare that agent 's life . Is that it ? Have I earned your help ? This isn 't about you . This is about me , about who I need to be right now , and I don 't ... Just take it . Thanks , barbie . CLAIRE : Did you mean all that stuff you said ? About how you 'd changed ? Finally . I quit , and it takes the service two hours to find a replacement ? Well , don 't just stand there . Come in . I 'm desperate . Excuse me , please . We are looking for Matt Parkman . No duh . Anyway , he 's a mess . Here you go . Diaper 's clean , but that won 't hold . Take it . Take it . No , thank you . Now . Wow .. Hey , wait . We are here to save Matt Parkman . Uh-huh . You 're holding him . Matt Parkman ? Lots of luck . You 're gonna need it . And by the way , this baby sitting service bites . SURESH 'S VOICE : Generations unfold , Father to son , mother to daughter . Where one leaves off , the other follows , [ Cell phone ringing ] Destined to repeat each other 's mistakes , each other 's triumphs . For how do we see the world if not through their lens ? The same fears , the same desires ? Do we see them as an example to follow , or as a warning of what to avoid ? Choosing to live as they have , simply because it 's what we know , or driven to create our own identity ? And what happens when we find them to be a disappointment ? Can we replace them ? Our mothers , our fathers ? Or will destiny find a way to drive us back ? Back to the familiar comforts of home ? subtitle made by unknown , edited and synced by rogard

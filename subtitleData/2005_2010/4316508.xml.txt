 Previously on the 4400 ... we 're not sure what 's just happened . The light is gone , and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared . - We 're letting them go . - We 're letting them go ? You don 't have a legal rightto hold them . You 're pregnant ? I wasn 't pregnant when i was abducted , but i was when i got back . What 's all this ? What 's it look like ? That baby could be the key to the future , and it has to be protected , and i can do that . Go ahead . Run ! That baby belongs with me . This is your new house ? It 's yours too . I 've been looking forward to this moment for too long . Diana skouris , your adoption of maia rutledge is hereby complete , legal , and binding . Her visions stoppedabout four months ago . We 're not sure why . Mrs. Usher next door is getting a kitten . Mommy 's bosses will be punished for betraying us . It wasn 't me ! That creature made me pull the trigger ! Getting dressed from the top down now ? That the way they do it on the mariners ? Mariners ? Gary 's got his eyes on the sox . No , you mean the sox got their eyes on him . How 's it feel , all those scouts in the stands ? You bend over to tie a shoelace , they make a note . How about a little respect , huh ? You 're in the presence of the new jackie robinson . First 4400 to make the big leagues . Don 't worry about the scouts , man . I 'll float you some right down the middle . You just get into your rhythm , forget they 're even out there , all right ? Can 't blame him . Six scouts . I 'd be afraidi was going to choke . I 'm not gonna choke . Barnes can 't serve them any better than that . Just ... just give me a second . He 's throwing him a beach ball . He 's scared , man . What was wrong with that ? What a loser . Follow through . Follow through . This time try taking the bat off your shoulder . Why don 't you try kissing my ass ? What 's your problem , gary ? Navarro ! Get your head in the game . Focus . I want to see some contact . The majors ? Kid doesn 't look like he 's ready for rookie ball . Just shut up ! Will all of you just shut the hell up and let me concentrate ? Whoa , gary ... take it down a notch . Yeah , you 're a flake , aren 't you ? Go ahead . Take a swing at me . I 'll plant you where you stand . I am not going to hit you ! Who said anything about hitting , man ? That 's it , navarro . You 're done for the day . I want to see you in my office after practice . There 's nothing wrong with me . There is nothing wrong with me . - Keep walking , mister . - There is nothing wrong with me ! Keep walking , mister . Now . Gary , man , take it easy . Don 't touch me ! This kid isn 't ready , man .

Not by much . It 's just a day or two . Let isabelle get rested up , then we 'll push on the rest of the way . We got enough to make it to white bird ? New car ... trip to the emergency room ... it 's going to be close . All this running and hiding , sometimes i forget we haven 't done anything wrong . Three dead men in the woods might disagree . Do you want to shower first , or should i ? You go ahead . Give isabelle her bottle , okay ? That was you , wasn 't it ? Who stopped those men in the woods ? Daddy sure would like to know . But you 're not going to tell me , are you ? What 's funny ? Marmaduke . Can we get a dog ? Oh , smooth , how you slid that in there . No . Skouris . April . No , no , no , no . I 'm glad to hear from you . You 're my sister . It 's just ... it 's been a while , that 's all . No , we 're here , just having breakfast . Hang on a sec . Mrs. Lennox must 've forgotten her key .

You look good . Yeah , you too . Thanks . What are you doing here ? The pacific northwest body art expo . I have a booth . Don 't tell me you haven 't gotten your tickets yet . Uh , no . Hello . Oh , my god . You must be maia . April skouris , black sheep of the family . Di , you are so lucky . Look at this fabulous kid you got . And no labor , no stretch marks , no diapers ... no crappy husband . Oh , wait , that was me . How come i never met you before ? - It 's complicated . - we 've been busy . Okay , we 'll stick with " busy . " Whatever . I 'm here now . So where are you staying while you 're in town ? This couch looks comfortable . It 's not an execution , shawn . Last time i was on stage was my fourth-grade spelling bee . These people are interested in us . They want to hear what we have to say . You 'll think of something . Hello . My name is shawn farrell , and i am one of the 4400 . Uh , a few months ago , i never thought anyone would ever clap when i said that . But we didn 't know then what we know now ... the future of mankind is in jeopardy , and right here , with your help , is where we start to set things straight . If you join us here ... mr . Collier , mr . Dravitt 's here for you . Thank you . ... the best versión of yourselves . Ian . Thanks for fitting me in . Interesting place you got here . I 'm not going to be abducted by aliens , am i ? No , ian . They weren 't aliens . They were from the ... future i know . So you 've told me , ad nauseum . Look , it 's all the same sideshow to me . So , here i am . Here you are . What say we get down to business ? Ian Dravitt . Founder and ceo of executive projections , a multinational corporation based in zimbabwe . Your company wants to do business in a third world country , they 'll show you the lay of the land . It 's all perfectly legitimate ... yeah , on the surface , but dravitt 's real money comes from mercenary activity and arms dealing . Sold grenade launchers to the i.r.a. , white phosphorus landmines to the shining path guerrillas in peru ... so what 's he selling to collier ? Good question , but our observation teams can 't even tell you what time collier takes lunch . Beyond the lobby , that place is a mystery . I mean , we 've sent our agents in disguised as air conditioning guys , fiber optics repairmen ... yeah , we get a bug in , it 's yanked before the day is over . Probably sweeping the place every few hours . As far as collier 's pow-wows with dravitt ... all we can do is guess . You think he 's stockpiling weapons ? Oh , arms , anthrax ... nothing would surprise me . I mean , collier 's all but said he 's at war with the u.s. Government . Could be laying down a defense perimeter around the center . That way , if we ever have to go in there , he 'll be ready . Think waco . Jonestown . Jarvis . I 'll send them down . Mr. Navarro ? I 'm agent skouris . This is agent ... please ... please , don 't talk . It 's too noisy . Your voices and your thoughts , they just all bleed together . The e.r. Report said you were going on about ... no voices . Just concentrate on what you want to ask me , and i 'll hear you . A couple of weeks ago . It was during a game . I could hear everyone 's thoughts . At first , it was just the pitcher , which was pretty good , actually ... because i knew everything he was going to throw before he threw it . Went five for five . Two homers , two singles , and a double . That is exactly what ... yeah , it was great when it started , but i can 't control it . First , it was everyone on the team , and then everyone in the stands , and then , i don 't know , it was just ... just everyone . It 's like this ocean of noise crashing around in my head . I want someone to make it go away . That 's what i want . I was this close ... to making it to the majors when i got snatched . This time , i 'm gonna make it . I have to make it . What , so navarro is really some kind of mind reader ? I believe " telepath " is the word you 're looking for . Well , call it something else if the word makes you uncomfortable , but the guy definitely knew what we were thinking . Interesting gift . I could think of a few practical applications for it . Dr. Ostman gave him some haloperidol . It calmed him down , quieted the noise some . So he can function as long as he 's on antipsychotic meds ? We don 't have to fit him for any straitjacket , but he 's not going to be hitting any knuckleballs either , which is all he wants to do . Yeah , i 'll put ntac medical on it . If they can help him , they will . Great . Kyle baldwin . Social security number ? There it is . Baldwin ... nope . You 're not eligible to register . Sure i am . I got in last semester . I just took deferred admissión . Except your tuition hasn 't been paid . What are you talking about ? My dad sent a check . Nope . Baldwin . Glad i caught you . I 've got navarro 's transfer forms right here . You sign them , he 's on his way to ntac medical . Yeah , i will , but not just yet . Why not ? Well , we want to know what Collier and ian dravitt are up to . A 4400 who can read minds just walked through the front door . You want to use navarro as a mole ? Is that even legal ? Mm-hmm . D.c. Cleared it . Well , how about ethical ? Guy 's asking us for help . Hell , he 's even begging us . And we 'll help him . But he 's got to help us first . What if he says no ? Then you 'll get him to say yes . Excuse me . Can we get one more blanket ? The one we have is kind of thin . Yeah , well , they 're all kind of thin , but if you want to bring it down , i 'll switch you . Oh , i think we might need both . You might think you need them , but you aren 't going to get them . See , there 's only so many rooms and so many blankets . And you have your allotment . My baby is cold . Can i please have one more blanket so she doesn 't get sick ? I 'll give you five dollars . I 'm a sucker for a pretty face . He wasn 't very nice to us , was he ? Here . Thank you What of thay catch me ? We 'll be monitoring you every step of the way we plant a tiny transmitter / receiver behind your ear under the skin takes 10 minutes , no scar if things go south we 'll be in there like the cavalry when i was a kid , my , uh my favorite show was " the man from U.N.C.L.E. " 30 years , just gone in a snap my little brother is retiring from the tacoma police force at the end of the year he 's 53 the guys i played ball with ? The ones that made it to the majors are ... signing autographs at card shows now the game is all i have yeah , i get that what , did you play ball ? Senior year in college i blew my knee out trying to slide under a tag what position ? Third base another infielder , huh ? You miss it ? All the time but what we do here , gary what we 're asking you to do for us ... it 's not the world series but it 's pretty damn important i do this for you guys ... you 're gonna fix me , right ? You have my word okay sorry about dinner new case well , i 'm glad you didn 't wait for me that 's what you 're sorry about ? Dinner ? Ask me how my first day of college was how was your first day of college ? I didn 't have one nobody paid my tuition what are you talking about ? Of course i did that 's ridiculous i tried calling you a bunch of times you didn 't answer your phone i was in meetings all day i know i wrote that check that 's great , dad i 'm sorry , kyle i must have forgot we 've been talking about this for months how could you forget ? Here . Bring it in tomorrow i 'll send a note or i 'll talk to the registrar myself whatever you want here kyle ! Don 't walk away from me just ... look i admit it i 'm not denying it , i screwed up but work 's been a little crazy ... oh , the job ? I 've been waiting for that one finally feels like old times around here what 's this ? Lily ? What is it ? Did you spend all the cash buying this stuff ? Then what ? Talk to me the cash register at the front desk ... was open ... and we needed food and isabelle needed diapers you stole money ? It 's not like i planned it i mean , i had to beg for a blanket and the drawer was open , so ... he left you standing there with the cash register open ? No , no , he closed it at least i thought he did i don 't know ... it wasn 't open , and then ... and then it was open that still doesn 't make it right that 's not how i live my life have you looked around ? 'Cause this isn 't how i planned to live my life either look , i know it was wrong i don 't need you to tell me it was wrong stop shaking your head just eat something , okay ? It 's silly for all this food to go to waste go ahead i 'm not hungry how much fun was that ? I liked it . Thank you so where have you two been ? Your note just said " out . " Lots of places the pier , pike street and even the ferry what have you done to ... you didn 't ! I told you she 'd freak ! Relax , they 're rub-ons as in " fake . " But they 're pretty , aren 't they ? Oh , yeah , they 're very pretty now why don 't you go get started on your homework ? I 'm in trouble do you at least like the shirt ? And by the way ... you live in seattle and your kid 's never heard of kurt cobain ? What 's wrong with you , di ? Thank goodness you 're here to teach her all about tattoos and suicidal rock stars and by the way who gave you permissión to take her out of school ? I 'm her aunt i didn 't know i needed permissión well , if you 're going to send her teacher home for the day you do sitting at your kitchen table all day long ? Yeah , that 's a big loss what are you keeping this kid locked away for ? If i wanted your opinion on how i 'm raising my daughter i 'd ask mommy ? What 's wrong , sweetheart ? I think i have to throw up what did you give her to eat ? Anything she wanted oh .

Yeah right right i , uh , i readlast night . Just like your syllabus said . That 's a good start . Well , not just the first 20 pages . I got really into it i read the whole thing . 19th-century novellas not quite the hell on earth you expected ? It definitely wasn 't boring . I 've got a lot of questions , though . Okay , well , i have office hours wednesdays , one to four . Okay , yeah , i 'll try to stop by . Or we could run by the coop and grab some coffee ? Like , right now ? I like talking about joseph conrad . It 's why i picked this for a living . Where did you learn to do all this ? Mom never taught us to cook . I don 't know i just learned how . Had to be better than you at something . Aunt April , do you have any kids ? Nope . No kids . Are you married ? I used to be . Ask your mom what she thought of my ex-husband . Don 't start . You didn 't like him ? Neither did april , apparently . She only stayed with trevor for what , seven months ? You were hostile from day one . You never gave him a chance . I didn 't really think he deserved much of a chance . He was ... kind of a moron . He was 22 . Show me one guy who isn 't a moron at 22 . He knew you hated him , and that didn 't make it any easier for us to stay together . Come on . You can 't keep blaming that on me . I mean , just grow up . Okay , this was a mistake . I thought it was a good idea to come here , but obviously i was wrong . I 'll go pack . There 's a little hotel up the street . No ! It 's okay , honey . We 'll still see ... but the power 's going to go out there tonight , and you won 't have any lights . What is she talking about ? Can i please be excused ? Mr. Navarro , is something wrong ? This is no good . I need my haloperidol . Where 's collier ? Mr. Collier 's in a meeting . Mr. Navarro ? Mr. Navarro ... [ diana ] : gary , what 's wrong ? [ Gary ] : i just got to talkto collier . That 's not a good idea , gary . Mr. Navarro ... He 's in a meeting ! Make it stop . Please , make it stop . Make it stop . I need my medication . Whatever 's eating you , old son , we 'll make it stop . Count on that . A 4400 who can read minds ? So you do have an ability . You shouldn 't have lied to me , gary . You mean to tell me that this guy knows what i 'm thinking ? Because i do not like anyone inside my head but me . Jordan , this guy 's one of us . We can 't just stand here and let him get killed . Nobody 's killing anyone . First we determine what our man here knows and then we discuss his fate . Because there are things i know that could get you killed ! That could get all of you killed . Call jarvis . Tell her we 're going in . Look , ian ... shut up ! Shut up now ! Hi . I 'm evan . Welcome to the 4400 center . Second level 's not open to visitors . We 're not visitors . Hey , look , buddy , i 've got a badge too , and this is private property . What the hell 's he doing to him ? Let him go , or so help me , i 'll splatter your brains all over your highly polished floor . Now , that is enough . Drop that weapon ! Now ! How the hell did you get in here ? You don 't sound so happy to see us . Well , now . What in the hell is this ? NTAC agents . I don 't appreciate the government interfering in my business . You should be more careful who you do business with . They 're not buying weapons . They 're planning a coup overseas , some tiny country . You sent a spy in here , uncle tommy ? Good job . You almost got us all killed . You too , mr . Dravitt . Well , it 'll be interesting to see if your friend 's impressions will stand up in court . I guess i 'm the one should be more careful who i do business with . Shawn , you can come with us if you want . Great . I 'll tell your mother you said hello . Gary , you should have come to me first . I 'd have treated you better than they ever will . We 're at war here . Don 't pick the losing side . Look at the cute little baby . I think somebody wants to try your toy , walt . I think you 're right . Hi . Hi . Put her back in the car ? Why ? Now , please . What 's your problem ? That little boy was being sweet with her . I just didn 't want anybody getting hurt . Hurt ? Who 's going to get hurt ? What if she doesn 't want to give the toy back ? What 's going to happen then ? Don 't look at me like you don 't know what i 'm talking about . Those three men in the woods ... they wanted us dead . You saw what happened to them . That was isabelle . We both know it , and there 's no use in pretending otherwise . Whatever isabelle does , she does it out of love for us . She 's our daughter , richard . I know she is . I love her right back , but she 's something else too , and i wish to god i knew what that was . What is it ? What 's wrong ? I 'm fine . So , what ? So collier planned to spend $ 30 million funding mercenary activity in sao tome ? They 've had three coups since their independence in ' 75 . My guess ? Collier was trying to buy number four . Did gary happen to hear why collier 's so interested in an island off the west coast of africa ? Without his medication , we 're lucky to have got that much out of him . Yeah , but we do know that collier thinks he 's headed towards a conflict with someone ntac , the entire government , i don 't know . He installs a friendly government in sao tome . It could have been a place to go when things heat up . What , like a homeland for the 4400 ? Too bad you can 't prosecute a man for delusions of grandeur . They 're not delusions if you can make them come true . We 're always one step behind collier because we keep seeing him as some kind of cult nut . What we should be asking ourselves is , before collier was abducted , did he ever set his mind to something and ... not get it done ? They didn 't make him any dumber in that ball of light . Well , anyway , we wanted to know what Collier was thinking . Gary found out for us . Time to turn him over to NTAC medical , right ? Soon . " Soon " ? The nsa is cc 'd any time we register a new 4400 ability . They have been leaning on d.c. To borrow gary for an op they 've got planned . No ... no more cloak-and-dagger stuff . He 'll sit in on a few conferences . You know how it is with diplomats . They don 't always say what they think . That wasn 't the agreement i made with him . But terms have changed . Gary 's too valuable . I gave him my word . You 're turning me into a liar . You 've been in the game almost 20 years . My guess is , you 've committed all the seven deadly sins , just like the rest of us . I should have let him stay with collier . He might have used him , but he would 've helped him too . Don 't you ever use me again . All i wanted was to play ball . You guys promised to help , but you can 't do that , can you ? We 're worried about the 4400 . It seems more and more like they should be worried about us . You know that bar , mel 's ? Corner of lancaster and third ? You feel like joining me ? We don 't go to bars . Well , i 'm going tonight , with you or without you .

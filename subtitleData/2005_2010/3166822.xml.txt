 Tin man part one * two little princesses * * dancing in a row * * spinning fast and freely on their little toes * * where the night will take you * * there 's only one way to know ... * * two little princesses dancing in a row ... * A storm is coming . We 're backing up in here . And I only got two hands , Carter . Where the hell 's DG ? Carter 's looking for you . He 's mad . He 's not the only one . DG ! Sorry , Carter . Bad enough Evie 's got to run to take care of that potato-head son of hers during the lunch rush , but now we got you perfecting the art of being late . Carter ! Guy on four wants a slice of french apple and a chunk of cheddar . It won 't happen again . A lot of people would fight for a job like this . Your future 's in the here and now , kid . Don 't throw it away . Yeah , right . I 've seen the line stretching across the prairie for this stepping stone . Fellow who wanted pie asked for you special , DG . Table four . Well , you just going to stand there ? Go . Go , go . This isn 't my day . Sure isn 't . Thank you . Oh , for god 's sakes ! That bad , popsicle ? Barometer 's falling , the wind 's rising , and I can 't get these new turbines to throw a watt . The spinner in Milltown was never as complicated as this . Well , everything 's better in Milltown , right ? Well , I did have to walk three miles through the snow to get to school . Heard you tossing and turning again last night . Oh , yeah . Your creepy cave nightmare again ? Yeah , it was different this time . I wasn 't alone . There was a woman there . She had the most beautiful lavender eyes I 've ever seen . Liz taylor ? No , here . Actually , I drew a picture of her . Whoa ... she could escort me through my dreams any night . She said , " a storm is coming . " What storm ? I don 't know . I 'll ask for clarification next time . Whoa-ho-ho , all right . Elmer gulch is a menace to the community . Menace or no , he is an officer of the law . You 're going to have to face the judge . Officer gulch wants you in jail . He doesn 't want me in jail . He wouldn 't have anybody to chase then . This is not a joke . We 'll be lucky if they just impound your bike . Then can 't impound my bike if I take off on it . I was wondering if you were planning a trip . You went through my stuff ? She 's been worried . We both have . You 've been acting strange , distant . If you spend your every spare moment drawing your pictures , dreaming of another life , you 're going to wind up never living the one you got . But this isn 't my life . This town , that job taking other people 's orders , that 's just passing time . There has to be more to life than this . And you really think you 'll find better out there ? Look , I love you guys , I just don 't feel at home here . I don 't think I ever have . Our job in this world has been to be the best parents that we can be . And it 's one we 've done proper , but she 's a young woman now . DG is having the dream . Knock knock ! You know your mom loves you more than anything in this world . I know . I just ... wish that she understood how I felt . You know , you 're as good an artist as you are a mechanic . The world 's going to be your oyster ... someday . I remember when I was in Milltown - dad , could you please stop talking about your perfect childhood in Milltown ? This is real life . Harass your old man all you want . These sketches remind me of home . No matter where we find ourselves , home is where your heart is . I can 't stay here forever . There 's a place and a time when we learn where we 're supposed to be . And you 're almost there ... and ... don 't forget , all of life 's answers - " are found along the old road . " I remember . How about the one about the daughter of light who searches for her home - frozen in time in the sea of ice . You got to get some new material , dad . And you 've got to realize that I 'm not a little girl anymore . You 'll always be my baby girl . General ... my search teams have returned from the northern guilds empty-handed . She will be less than happy . She always is . You made me a promise . Unfortunately , there were complications with the resistance spies in the north . A slight delay , sorceress . That 's all . The emerald , Lonot . Where 's my emerald ? We will double our efforts , close the vice even tighter . All I need is a little more time . There is no more time . In seven days , the double eclipse will darken our skies . If I don 't have the emerald in my hand by then , everything I have worked so hard for ... all of this ... will be lost . We will have it ? I give you my word . Something wrong , sorceress ? I need to see Lylo . Peer into the future . Tell me if there 's anything that will hinder my plans . It hurts Lylo to look . It will hurt more if you don 't . Those who resist you will continue to be conquered . The emerald , Lylo , will I find it in time ? Where is it ? Lylo knows not , but before the eclipse , in your hand , it will be . It will be ! Do you see anything that will stand in my way ? Lylo see nothing , but ... but what ? Lylo feels ... a presence . A - a glimmer of light in the darkness . Light from the other side . The other side ? General lonot ... awaken a travel storm . Take a small company of men , and just slip through to the other side . Find this light and extinguish it . A storm is coming ! A storm is coming ! A storm is coming ... wind must be shorting out the power . Where is she ? Dad ! Are you okay ? No , DG , go back ! Ow ! Go , go , go ! Ah ! Dad , come on ! Get this thing of ! Dad , are you okay ? H , ah . Yea I 'm fine . Turn this around . Push it down the stairs . Go , go ! Dad , who are those guys ? Longcoats . What ? This wasn 't the way it was planned . I know , but it 's our only chance . E to take her there now . Take me where ? There 's no time to explain , DG . Dad , whaare ou dng ? ? me ! You have to jump ! No ! You have to jump ! No ! We need to go , DG ! The longcoats are after you ! What ? Why ? Because it 's time ! Time for what ? Are you doing ? You have to trust us ! Mom ! Dad ! Where am I ? Hello ! Hello ! Beware ... oh , you have to be kidding me . Watchful . Be watchful . I like not the look of her . Back off , jack ! And gaze not into her eyes , for fear she 'll turn you into a skree . Who are you ? I 'm DG . Who are you ? I am red hatt . We are resistance fighters of the eastern guild . Do not speak of who we be . We know not of her trickery . Trickery ? My parents are missing . I 'm the victim of some sort of a natural disaster . Creatures do not fall from the sky lacking magic . Mobats fall from the sky . Mobats have wings ! Wings or not , she 's a spy ! A spy from the sky ! No , I 'm not a spy . I 'm not a spy . Get her to the camp . Stop your worrying . Of course the people of the O.Z .. Will be taken care of . I never said that-you did - no , you didn 't . Don 't say that . Perhaps we should return . Uh-huh . No need . She 's ready for you . Sorceress ... report . The source of the light was a girl of 20 annuals . A girl ? Bring her to me . Unfortunately , there were problems . Last time complications , this time problems ? She disappeared into the storm along with her parents . Your storm ? Are you saying they could be here ? Othersiders in the outer zone ? I am sorry , sorceress . You did your best . Zero ... you 've just been promoted . If this girl is in the O.Z .. , find her . Will azkadellia attack from the east ? Who ? The sorceress azkadellia ! The one for whom you spy . From which direction will her men come ? Will they walk , or will they fly ? Okay , how many times do I have to tell you guys that nothing you 've said has made any sense to me ? Perhaps she is just a girl . Yes , I am . I 'm just a girl . Azkadellia has raided most all villages searching for the stone . Are we next on her list ? I don 't know about any list , buy if this is how you treat strangers , I 'm not surprised you have enemies . You know what , can you just please put my locket down ? It has sentimental value . Our scouts spotted these two being pursued by longcoats on the old brick route to central city . Or leading the longcoats there . Somebody saw my parents ? You say parents , I say spies . There 's only one way to know if she speaks truth or lies . Strap her to the flayer , and she talks or dies . Warm up the blades . Squeal as you peel till the truth brings a deal . Hey ! You guys are out of your tiny minds ! What are you doing ? Up here ? Little ankle-biters thought it 'd be funny to keep me hanging around . Loosen that rope , and I might have the last laugh . Come on , doll . If mom and pop really are on the route to central city , then you 're falling further and further behind . You know the way ? Sure . But it 's kind of hard to give directions like this . Unless you have a better offer ... ah ... ooh ... what the hell ? Hey , you ain 't so hot on first glance either , honey . Is-is there a problem ? Hmm ? Oh , um , your , uh ... what ? Your , um ... your zipper 's undone . Oh ... didn 't mean to offend . Got to be careful not to lose your marbles , but , uh , since the sorceress had her medicos take mine ... well , you flick the abacus . Why would they remove your brain ? Because of what I know , or used to know , whatever it was . Name 's Glitch , on account of sometimes my synapses don 't fire right . Sometimes my synapses don 't fire right . You just said that . Did I ? There you go , glitching again . And here I was thinking this nightmare couldn 't get any weirder . This isn 't a nightmare . This is the O.Z .. The outer zone . It used to be a piece of heaven , too . Until azka-d got her claws into it . Longcoats ! What are you doing ? I have an idea ! Hello ? DG ? It 's ... it 's too high to jump . I - I really don 't think this is a good idea . Come back ! Come back right now . Ah ! Come on , we don 't have much time ! Wait for me . DG ... come on ! Quickly , before they see us . Shh ! Hurry . Oh , look , there 's a rope ! My noggin wasn 't always this way , you know . In my heyday , I was government advisor and numero one . I was the top dog 's ... right hand man . It would have all been fine , but her ... the road is around here somewhere . I - l-I know it . Help ! Help ! You look familiar . Have we met before - shh ! Did you hear that ? Yeah ... no . No , no ! No ! No ! No ! Those guys are everywhere . Yeah , that 's life in the O.Z .. These days . Tough and tougher . Not my boy , leave him alone ! Leave him ! No ! Oh ... but even with half a brain , I can tell that we 've got to get out of here . Oh , cripes . Stop it ! Hey ! DG , this isn 't your fight . Leave them alone ! What just happened ? What is it ? A t . D. E. S. P. H. T. L. A tri-dimensional energy-stored projected holographic time loop . Nifty little thing . Hey , I think I invented it . So , it was all fake ? No . I - it happened , sometime or another . Why would they have it playing over and over again if there was no one here to watch it ? Well , I think it ... there 's someone in there . Or something . Whoa . Are you okay ? Where are they ? I 'm going to kill him . So he just had to stand there and watch while his family got tortured over and over again ? The most imaginative tortures are saved for those who resist azkadellia . How long were you trapped in there ? Since that was a sapling . Much obliged for the help . You 're welcome , mr . Cain . I 'm DG , by the way , and this is - I know , a headcase . I have a proper name , you know . And when I remember it , I 'll tell you . What 's a headcase ? It 's what the state does to re-educate criminals . They rip out their brains , make them prisoners of their own minds . Ain 't that right , convict ? Hey , whoa . I ain 't no convict , and just in case I am , it-it was a bogus charge , a frame-job , I 'm sure of it . Yeah , well , I 'll see you down the road . Oh , actually , a road is what we 're looking for . We 're looking for the brick route - - brick route . That leads to a place called central city - - central city . Do you know of it ? Yeah . It 's where Zero was headed after ... that 's where I 'm headed now . Great ! We 'll go with you . I got business . Besides , I don 't travel with kids or convicts . Um , I 'm not a kid , and the people who came to your home came to mine . I 'm just looking for my parents . And I 'm looking for my brain . And maybe we can to help you find - maybe you can what ? My wife ? My boy ? They 're gone . Probably just like your folks are . Look , nothing personal , kid , but look at you . First sign of trouble , you 're just going to cut and run . Nothing personal , but when we found you , you were in a tin box . You don 't know me . Come on , Glitch , we 'll find the way ourselves . The way ? The way leads through the fields of the pa-pay . Pa-pay ? What ? I 've been tossed into a storm , trussed up by lawn gnomes , chased by madmen on horseback , how bad can pa-pays be ? I seen them gnaw people in half inside 30 seconds . Zipperhead , keep your mouth shut . Kid , you stay behind me . Why the sudden change of heart ? Believe me , heart 's got nothing to do with it . Psst ! It came from a young woman . The othersider . Do you know who she is ? I will . What 's that ? What 's what ? Ah ! Don 't touch that ! That 's a predigestive enzyme the pa-pay runners use to tenderize their meat . Come on , let 's go . There 's someone in there . An advance hunter party must have snared it . We better get out of here before their friends come back . We can 't just leave him here . You snatch a dinner from a runner , you best be prepared to become its replacement . Let it be . Oh , the poor thing must be scared to death . All right , come on . Let 's go . Hey , can I borrow your razor ? You want that bad attitude dripping out of your ears ? Run ! Go ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Go , DG ! Wrong turn . Go ! The fall might kill us ! Well , they definitely will ! Okay , on the count of three . One ... three ! She searches through the east . Looking for what ? Love . For those she loves . We need to go DG ! The longcoats are after you . DG ? Get a shovel . You lied to me . She 's alive . How could you do such a terrible thing ? Well , it won 't work , you know . She 's still a child . She 's here , isn 't she ? In the O.Z. ? Tripping over her pigtails as she wanders in circles . Oh , thank the stars . What else do you have planned ? Hmm ? Nothing , I ... there is no plan . My prison is obviously a little too comfortable for you . I 'll send out my best spies . No . I 'll send out mine . Hey , you want to come closer to the fire ? Warm up ? Should have left me to die . Oh , great , a basket case . Stay right there . It 's okay . We 're all friends here . You are sad . Miss your mother , and father . They miss you . My name 's DG . What 's yours ? Raw ... well , it 's certainly to the point . You 're injured . He 's a viewer . Viewers are like psychics , but instead of seeing with their minds , they see with their hearts . Azka-d abducts his kind , gets her alchemists to suck the second sight right out of their heads . He could be a big help . Look , I don 't know where you came from , but if you have any interest in staying alive in the O.Z .. , you better get one fact straight real fast . Trust no one . Let 's hope those runners don 't have fang pox . Heal wound . Soothe . What are you doing ? Hey , wait , wait , wait - ah ! Brave man . Good man . Tin man . Oh , I might have known you were a tin man what with that attitude . What 's a tin man ? It 's what they call policemen in central city . At least I think it is . You 're a cop ? Was . Until Zero found out I was part of the resistance . You saw the rest . Thanks . I picked up your parents ' trail to the west . Good work , my xora . I knew my oldest friend would never fail me . You called for me ? She 's near the fields of the pa-pay . Hey , how about a pitstop , Cain ? No time . Oh , come on , tin man , have a heart . I 'm a thinker , not a hiker . Yeah , we could all use a rest . Don 't forget , all of life 's answers - are found along the old road , I remember . " All of life 's answers are found along the old road . " Did you just say " old road " ? That 's what the locals call the brick road . I thought you said you 'd never been here before . I haven 't been here before but I know this place . The spinner in Milltown was never as complicated as this . No matter where we find ourselves , home is where your heart is . All my dad 's stories ... my parents were from here . What happened here ? Milltown 's been erased . Azkadellia 's term for cleansing history . Uh-oh . We shouldn 't be here . No humans allowed . DG ! What ? Oh , hey , guys . Uh , we were just passing through . We were just passing through ... we were just passing through - stoke the pyre ! Yeah ! Pyre ? Azkadellia 's invaders must be made an example of ! What ? This is ridiculous . I don 't even know this azkadellia person . You who spoke , what is your name ? DG . Your voice patterns are familiar . I 've never been here before . Hey , don 't let him confuse you , baby girl - dad ! He 's just a crazy old cyborg . Oh , I was scared I 'd never see you again . How 's your leg ? Everything 's okay now you 're here . I can 't believe that this is your home . Not just ours . You know how you felt like you never fit in on the other side ? What do you mean ? Well , that voice father vue recalled ... um ... was your mother 's . It 's your voice ? Not mine . Your real mother 's . We are series 1487 ... nurture units . Um , nurture units ? We were programmed with specific protocols to love and protect you like you were our own . Okay , that 's weird . Um ... you 're robots ? Oh , my life is a lie ! It wasn 't a lie to us . We ... we feel like your parents , DG . We love you , but our deeper purpose was to tell you the stories of our world , stories that would prepare you for your return . My return ? When you started having the dreams , we knew it was time for you to come back to the zone , but the longcoats came before we could explain . I 'm from here ? Our final task was to bring you to father vue . He can tell you how to find your real mother . 15 annuals past , Milltown was the jewel of the O.Z .. During that time , a beautiful woman in a dark cloak came to me , her spirit full of dread . She 'd just lost her husband , feared losing her child , too . A girl child she called DG . That 's the woman from my dreams , the one with the lavender eyes . That 's ... that 's my mother ? She was so weak and frightened , I 'm not sure how she found the strength to go on . So afraid that she 'd be discovered , that we 'd be discovered . Doing what ? Saving you . By trusting you to us . Upon your return , your mother tasked me to give you something . She wants it to guide you on your journey . Let it connect you to the light . Ec cot you to her . Longcoats are coming . We 're running out of time . Where can I find my mother ? I know not . But there is a man in the central city who has all the answers . He 's smart , magical , powerful . Some even say he 's a wizard . The mystic man . Yes . You know him ? I worked his protection detail for a time . He 's a good man . Come on . But ... wait ! Please come with us . We can 't , honey , our place is here . You have to go . We are so proud of you . I love you both . I 'm sorry , kid , we got to go . Bye ! Quickly , this way . How much does she know ? It doesn 't have to be like this for either of you , you know . I mean , we could all be friends . How ? Big changes are planned ? You could play an important part in the future of the O.Z .. , or you could be a verse in a song . It 's your choice . Come on , come on ! There it is . Shining city on the hill is starting to tarnish . This isn 't going nearly as well as I thought it would . Looking for resistors . This is a nightmare . We 're going to need some help . Central city people gather round ! Antoine demilo is back in town ! I don 't believe it . Gratification collected from near and far will be available , at reasonable rates , inside the gate in the sin district square . Hey , you , with the stupid hat ! Move it , will ya ? I got commerce to commence here . Wyatt freakin ' Cain . I thought they were pissing ' on your grave . I see you 're moving up in the world . How the sleaze business , demilo ? Well , since you been gone , biz is booming , so , you know , if you don 't mind , I 'm working here , a 'ight ? So am I. Hey , you 're not sportin ' tin no more , so leave go me before I call the nice longcoats over there and request that they bloody your personage ! Ah ! Who needs tin when you have a picture of a certain little man playing bedsheet bingo with Zero 's first wife ? What ? Come on , Cain . Me and mrs . Z , we-we was just joking around . Oh , really ? Why don 't I go ask Zero , see if he thinks it 's funny . Whoa ! Please , have a heart . The guy 'll flay me like a munchkin ! He won 't have to if you get us inside , and tell me where I can find Zero . What are you gunning for Zero for ? That 's a short hop to a deep grave . You don 't know the half of it . Are you going to help us ? No . Really ? Yeah . Okay . Okay . Tonight 's his weekly shack-up . Ah ! Ooh . Ah . Oh ... that was easy , wasn 't it ? Oh , god , I hate tin men , especially ex-tinmen . Get your mutts in the wagon . City people , gather round ! Antoine demilo is back in town ... good driving , ma . Okay , we 're in . Okay , where can we find the mystic man ? Excuse me , is there a sign on my back , " central city taxi tourist information ? " Oh ! Ow ! Okay , all right . All right . So the mystic man . That 's who you come here for ? Is he still in central city ? Oh , he 's here all right . He 's just not holding court where he used to . Ah ! Ooh ! These 'll get you front row seats . All right ? You can 't go dressed like that , cupcake . Maybe my girls can find you something . You 'll find her something . Ah ! Now , look , the mystic man 'll have your answers . You don 't need me anymore . Don 't go after Zero . You 're not a killer , you 're a tin man . I told you I 'd get you here , and I did . You take care of yourself , kid . So these are the precious parents ? Where 's your darling girl ? You ran the coercion virus on their cpu 's ? They told us everything , and don 't even remember . Apparently , the girl went to retrieve a message held by the mystic man . My gods , the little bitch has gone to see the wizard . * he 's the man * * the mystic man * * he 'll answer your questions * * he always can * * his wisdom is known throughout the land * I guess old mystic man 's a patron of the , uh ... theatrical arts . * if you 've got a problem he 's got the plan * * the mystic man the mystic man ... * * the mystic , the mystic the mystic man ... * silence ! It is time for the great and terrible mystic man . Question . Mystic man , answer me this , what is the meaning of life ? The answer to that question is as timeless as the moons . We must serve the forces of the universe ... with all our humanity ... and all our humility . First , we must inhale ... the magic . If he 's the man with all the answers , what 's wrong with him ? And hold it ! He 's out of his mind , literally . Hold it ... and you know the meaning of life ! Inhale the magic ? Azkadellia 's vapors . A magic mist that contains a spell of bliss . He doesn 't know if he 's up or down . I 'm sorry , DG . Hi . How you doin ' ? Wait . You know what I like ... well , I know what you like , so just relax , and I 'll make all your dreams come true . Where 's Zero ? Got to go . You just missed him . He busted out of here pronto , something about some girl being smuggled into the city . Cover the back . Lock this place down . They don 't leave . Check upstairs . Seen her ? No ? Hey , there 's that guy who locked up Cain . We go now . We 've got to get out of here . No , I 'm not leaving until I get my answers . Have you seen this girl ? Come in . Come in ! Yes , yes , yes , yes , yes . Hi . Yes , come in , yes . Can i , uh ... can I ask you a question ? Yeah , she 's down at the end of the hall . Room number 2 . Shh ... find Zero . Drop it , or I 'll blow you into next week . I thought you weren 't a tin man anymore . We got to go . We can 't . He 's not well . Who 's not well ? Oh my ... that 's not the mystic man I remember . Azkadellia 's really messed him up . She 's got him on the vapors . Hey ... look , until this wears off , you 're going to have to hurt for a while , okay ? I need answers now . It 'd be vapors talking , not him . Do you think Zero 's going to wait ? Sir ? Sir , sir ... you have some answers ... answers ? Yes . Sure . Many years ago , you helped a woman smuggle a child out of the O.Z .. Yes , yes . He O.Z .. Yes . Out of the O.Z .. Yes ! Yes . I was that child . Right . So you have to help me find out where my mother is , who my mother is . Um ... woman , uh , um ... women are great . No , uh ... I remember , um ... I remember who-who , um ... who ... my mother . Who ? My mother . Whose mother ? My mother - whose mother - oh ! I 'm sorry . You have most brilliant beautiful blue eyes , but your mother ... you mother had lavender . You do remember . Okay , kiddo , we got to get out of here right now . Not now , mr . Cain . He hasn 't told us where to find my mother . Cain ? Cain , you were one of mine , weren 't you ? A tin man . A long time ago . I 'll talk to you later . Psst ! Psst ! Please ... the northern island . The northern island . Your journey for her , to find who you are , starts there . Let this guide you . Okay . All right , you two , get those two out of here . Let 's go , let 's go . No , no , no . No , you stay with her at all costs . I have to take care of Zero . You isow who she now . She 's the key . Promise me . I want your word as a tin man you will not leave her side at any cost . You have my word . Wakey wakey , sunshine . Go away , we 're closed . Ow ! I said back off , moron . Class act , demilo . Cain , what do you want ? Thanks for the ride . How can you do this to me ? I have a wife and children . This is my wagon ! How do you start this thing ? Oh , you go to pull the knob out , then twist the red thing . Thank you . This is my wagon ! Cain ! Cain , I 'm talking to you ! Cain , I ... that 's my wagon ! If it isn 't the great and terrible blah , blah , blah himself . What are you up to , old man ? Huh ? A little scent . A little whiff . Oh , you don 't fool me . Please ? Please . Please . Why did she come to see you ? What did you give her ? Hook him up . What was that ? I don 't know . You all right ? Yeah , just freezing . You stay here . Oh , what now ? Broke axle . No kidding . Come on , let 's go . We 're walking . What we 're looking for is over there . Ice mountain ? That 's the northern island ? Well , I know it 's around here somewhere . " Frozen in time in a sea of ice , " just like my dad said it would be . The microcosm is expanded by a single bead of sweat dropped on a pinhead and spun into a million universes until it is converted into the elixir of the gods ... he 's masking . Lylo see too much ! ... and can longing , great and passionate longing reach fulfillment . Lylo see too much ! My fingers , extended to the stars ... focus , Lylo , don 't let him sway you . ... becomes merely a flicker in the light of the storm , a glimpse of heaven , fierce and beautiful and unfiltered - pain ... where is she ? So much pain . Move beyond the pain . The northern island . She 's going to see mommy . Dig . Dig ? What do you mean , dig ? Wait , wait . " The daughter of light " came upon " a glistening white mountain " frozen in time in a sea of ice . " Above all else she knew that ... " that this mountain " was more than it appeared . It was home . " Is it locked ? My mother was the queen ? That makes you princess . You knew my mother . I knew I wasn 't an idiot , or a convict . I was the queen 's advisor . " The queen sat ... " gazing hopefully out upon her frozen realm ... " longing for her daughter to return . " DG , wait . Sad ... mother waited . Couldn 't stay . There is something so familiar about this . No . Bad things ... bad things happened here . What bad things ? We go . We go now . No . No , I need to know . Raw , please . Bad things ... * two little princesses dancing in a row * * spinning fast and freely on their little toes * * where the light will take you there 's only one way to know * * two little princesses dancing in a row ... * my angel , my light . Sleep well . Wait , that 's you . I knew you , too . Oh , I wish I could remember . " The majestic queen of the O.Z .. Had two lovely daughters she ... " that 's azkadellia . Marbles or not , evil like that you don 't forget . Azkadellia 's my sister . " One to darkness " she be drawn , " and one to light she be shown . " Double eclipse it is foreseen , " light meets dark in the stillness between , " but only one , " and one alone , " shall hold the emerald and take the throne . " Only one , and one alone . She tried to kill me . No . She did kill you . But that can 't be . I 'm so sorry I didn 't protect you . I never thought ... oh , my angel . Fear not , my child , there is one thing that can stop her . The emerald of the eclipse . The secret to finding it now lives inside of you . When the time is right , you will return . Mother never could leave well enough alone . Azkadellia . You 're my sister . DG ... the little sister I thought I no longer had . I 've always wondered what you 'd look like . Leave her alone . What do you want ? Well , up until a moment ago , I wanted your death , but now it seems you have something I need . What ? The emerald . You know where it is . Don 't tell me you haven 't dreamed of it , heard it calling to you begging to be found from its dark hiding place . No , I haven 't . No ? No . What did she whisper in your ear ? I don 't remember . That 's a shame . How can I tell you what I don 't know ? DG , where are you ? Mother ? DG , where are you ? What have you done with her ? Put her away for safe-keeping . Like any good daughter would . Where ? Somewhere you will never find her . Go ! Go ! Wait ! Bring her to me . Now I know why they call you Zero . Still can 't fight your own battles . I do my share . DG ! Bring him . Put me down ! No iron suit for you this time . No wife and child crying for years to free you from it . My family 's alive ? Hardly matters now . Glitch ! Ah ! Welcome back , little sister . There 's no place like the O.Z ..

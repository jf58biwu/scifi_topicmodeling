 you say hello . Slash ! Dan ! Can you run away from me ? Moron ! I 'm not running ! awesome ! There 's more to basketball than running in a straight line ! Rouge ! Okay ! This is the end . Prepare to fire the Legend Bullet . So you 're lowering the curtain on this play yourself ? The video feed is broken with static ... Their farcical ball game will never be more than an unsightly parody where they clown around until our very moment of despair . What a load of crap ! { alt tl : You must be kidding me ! } The gods don 't extend their hands to everyone . They show the signs only to those who uphold their will . You can 't play hero and expect to save the world . You 're not too bad now yourself . Better take me seriously ! Iceman ! Destroy ! What ? ! Don 't forget about me ! Sela ! nice one . Sela . Even though my mech moves so well ... Even though it does exactly what I ask it to ... Goddammit ! Gramps ! There at Dangan 's feet ! but those are the old shoes . We don 't have any more spares ! I can keep going ! Slash ? It 's catching up with me already ? Not yet ! Not yet ! There 's something up with him ! I know ! This play ... These steps ... Oh ! It was you ! They 're going all out . True . Still ... Show me ... Show me the legend ! Show me the thunderbolt 's power ! Hold on ... This can 't be all there is to my power ! You 're shaking . I 'm human too . Time to make a legend . Starting Legend Bullet launch sequence . Countdown to Cannon blast ignition . Ten ... Nine ... Look at that ! Dan . Let 's go for it ! They 're incredible . But I 'm not done yet ... I 'm here too ! Rouge ? I see . She 's like Slash . she 's undergone reinforcement just like him . Not bad . What 's that ? The Legend Bullet ! I hear them . I hear their voices . Confirmed ballistic launch from the Skybloom Kingdom ! They 're early ! They 're early ! The Legend Bullet has escaped Earthdash 's atmosphere . Collision trajectory to Mooneyes is clear ! moon ! Stones ... Colors ... A power flattened ruthlessly under heel . There 's strength flowing through me ... Dan ! Yeah . Rouge ! Penetration of the Lunar Interceptor System confirmed ! Naturally . What ? Dan ! Got it ! Dan ! End it ! Rouge ! Something is falling towards us . That damned Yan . Don 't worry . Mr. Slash ? daughter of my younger brother Regalia . I will strike it down . Father is your younger brother ? You ... Brother ! after all ! Not yet ! I have to ... ! Slash ! Dan ! Basquash ! Dan ... That was truly fine . You are the legend . Dan ! The manas is gushing up ... I feel an overflowing power . Earthdash and the moon ... Their ultimite is resonating back and forth . Slash ... The power ... vanished ? H-Huh ? I guess you 're the wrong one . I 'm ... the wrong one ? What 's that ? It must be the Legend Bullet that Yan launched . sacrificed himself to change the Bullet 's orbit . King of the moon ... Father 's older brother ... The Legend Bullet is now in lunar orbit . It failed . Failed ? Why ? There must have been some obstacle . Something sufficient to push the Bullet into orbit . That can 't be ... It was our last hope ... What 's the deal ? I made a kick-ass dunk . I thought I was supposed to save the world ... Dan ... look ! Princess ! Princess Flora ! Jiiya ! Baaya ! Well done . Is something amiss ? I 'm sorry . It looks like we 're too late . Dan . Navi ? I 'm glad . Thank James . I 'm not the guy . I see . That 's too bad . Navi . Sela . I 'm glad to see you . Me too . Even with the surface and the moon like they are ... the fact I could see you again ... I know ... it must ... Sela . Navi ... Navi ... Are we all gonna die now ? Do we just give up ? It 's not fair ... we 're still alive . We 're alive . What is it ? that 's right . I 'm me . Navi ! Gimme those shoes . Here I come . I swear ... Dan ! Destroy ! Basquash ! What 's the use of basketball now ? Still ... Still ... It 's amazing ... I won 't give up ! I love this city ! I love these people ! I 'll do everything in my power ! I am who I am ! Citron ! Falcon ... young lady ? Dan ! Iceman ! Slash . I 'm not the guy you thought I was . This is who I am ! Basquash . Who art thou ? The owner of the voice I hear may be surprisingly close to us now . Does that mean ... ? The source of the voice ... is there . The Legend Bullet . I see it ... feel what she 's feeling ... The gods ... I 'm afraid even Slash can 't survive becoming this cute . Thank you for looking after my brother . I don 't look after him . I 'm grateful to you . Grateful ? I have to go . I 'm sure there must be something left that I can do . That 's what Dan and Slash have taught me . Ultimate Bystander . Regalia the 13th . My orders are thus . Lift your guard of the Palace and guide the refugees here ! What kind of kingdom locks the people out ? ! Sire ! Who art thou ? Yes . I am a king . it is incumbent on me to hear the voice of my people ... That 's what the stones have been crying to me all along . Just as you were . Father ! Flora . Sister ? Father and I can feel you through the stones . I see ... Of course you can . The stones are alive . And all things are connected . Now I get it . So they 're alive ! Never saw that coming ! And you are ? Thousand . People call me the woman who delves for truth . What ? I see ... I never thought science would give myth a helping hand . How ironic . Iceman ! Dan ... Navi ! Sela ! you 're moving easier than before . That 's right ... This is what I was after all along . Chasing desperately after that ball ... And now ... Navi ! Sela ! The ruins ... They 're responding ! Who art thou ? Bring the wounded to this tent ! The soup kitchen 's over here ! Just one meal per person ... get over here ! We don 't got enough hands ! Don 't let them beat us ! We 're gonna protect this town ! Basquash ! but I can at least say this . What ? Basquash ! like giants ... Oh ! It 's not just one ! All of us are â€” Miss Rouge ? Rouge ! Miyuki . Dan 's in your hands ! then Earthdash 's ultimite will revive at the same moment . right now is our chance . Huh ? It 's a possibility of ultimite . The effective conductivity of the cables straddling the terminator line depends on the initial resistance from the extra goal 's terminus . And that means ... Gramps ? You don 't have me beat yet . Princess . I want to run too . and see the future of this world ... and I 'll bear witness to what lies ahead . Take me on ! Basquash . You 're ... ! Dan ! Use this ! Rouge ! though ! who art thou ? you wanna know ? Dan ! You got it ! Taste that for yourself ! Yeah ! Eat this ! I won 't be beaten either ! Let 's end this ! but the legend of everyone ... this is a new legend . The legend of ... Awaken . It begins . Song . Voices . Colors . Basquash ! Basquash ! Basquash ! Basquash . Basquash . Basquash . Looks like the moon 's back in proper its orbit now . I wonder if this is how parents feel when their children go out into the world . Lonely ? Warm all through ... Slash Keens . wasn 't it ? Many legends . The crisis will come again one day . The legend will repeat itself ? I don 't know about that . all legends manifesting at the same time ... It 's just ... What ? We 're alive . Rouge ! Rouge ! Rouge ! Rouge ! Everybody ... Rouge . Earthdash and the moon are both saved ! Where 's Dan ? Basquash .

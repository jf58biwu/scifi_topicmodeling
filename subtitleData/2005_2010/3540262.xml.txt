 Previously on kings ... Port prosperity . Issue peace . Real , lasting . Six months hence ? Hey , David Shepherd , you 're under arrest . On what charge ? Treason . The bloody king of carmel , vesper abadon . I 'm the only one who ever tells you the truth . I 'm pregnant . Your father , he has eyes for David 's blood . If he knew , he would never let that child live . King Silas framed this entire case . Coerced witnesses , faked evidence , Convinced me to lie against David . You 're a traitor . You 're both traitors ! You 're all traitors ! After seeing what Silas really is , They 'll be begging for his replacement . We act now- - And the country will have its new king . Yes ... I think you may have made a mistake . What 's this ? Incentive . To see if the tongue relied upon retains all its facility . Chocolate . Cassis . Vines grown in clay , roots at the surface . mm . Mm . Oak there . Two years to mellow . Ivanov ' 61 ? So ... You want to stay king ? Gath to arrive at 10 : 00 a.M. Good . The ceremony for the handover of port prosperity Is scheduled for 11 : 00 . No , delay it till noon . David 's gone . No prison , no records- - He 's made it like David never existed . Politics is the priority now . Soon we give land back to Gath . And your grandchildren someday will tug on your sleeve And ask you what it was like when your father made peace . A peace David brokered . How can you sit here and cater his parties After what he did to David , to Jack ? You have more to live for now than David . If he knew what you carried , he 'd say the same . I already betrayed him once . I can 't let him down again . If you wanna have any chance of saving him , You 'd give the king a reason to say yes when you beg . You got yourself here . It 's time to change or die . You have to learn to live without air . And for you , air is adoration . Oh , is it wrong to seek the opinion of the people ? Of course it is . You 're the best thing for them , and they don 't know it . That 's right . What would they have without Silas ? You . You see . They owe you . Stop trying to win their approval . It is better to be feared than loved . Necessary . Maybe you once brought your country into a new day , But that day is done . Now you rule by night . Cutting out pictures . I have to do something to pass the time , And you 've taken up all the pacing . You call this a safe house ? I 'm suffocating . You have to get me out of here . My father 's the one that should be in prison , not me . You said we would act now . We are . Listen . He lost their trust when the treasury crashed . Their security , when the city went dark . Thanks to you , they all know he 's a petty murderer . Now he 's giving away their land . The people will beg you to take his place . No one will remember the names your father called you . Then it happens at port prosperity . Your last hours as prince . Savor them . My son ? Hang him . My peace ... You want to give Gath the land , do it . Those for , plant in front of the cameras . Those against , plant in the dirt . That simple ? Don 't hide it . Let the sun dapple the whole damn mess . And anyone still plotting against you Will do it slipping in a blood puddle . I 'm trying to win my people back , Not get them to hate me more . They already think me a tyrant . I know you , Silas , better than anyone . My worst enemy ... now my only friend . You 're no tyrant . But you could be ... If you tried . Things could get complicated after port prosperity . I 'll have the jet ready to take you first thing . You don 't want me around . I just want you safe . What you 're doing is so important . I don 't want to be safe , I want to be a part of it . I can be useful , you 'll see . And Shepherd ? You need to kill him , and soon . He 's watched over . How do you kill someone whom god protects ? Easy . With a bullet . What the hell is that ? You 've a lot of catching up to do . Feed him . It 'll be your last meal . When we give the land back to Gath , you die . Then I 'll truly have peace . And tomorrow , six months after king Silas announced The return of these lands to Gath , as part of the peace ... Controversy surrounds the king 's message , And many think the handover of port prosperity Is yet another misguided ... The country remains divided on the issue of the land return . King Silas ' judgment has been called into serious question Since his shocking outburst during the Shepherd trial . The king and the Gath premiere Will meet at port prosperity at noon tomorrow . Some consider the price of peace too dear . We open the gate , we close the gate . I guess they 're still giving the land back , Big day coming . Yeah , we got to stay here . The entire house staff has something To do with the ceremony , And we got to stay at the gate . This is our job . It 's important . How ? It just is . The king approaches . Tomorrow has come . Some of you meet it with reproach And with the unkind thought that the return of any land To an enemy is weakness . Lose that thought , friends . The handover at port prosperity will take place , And Gath will be our unfiring chum . In the name of peace , I will crush any In the blessed event 's way . There are some still in their homes , sir , Refusing to leave . Any who have not vacated by the deadline Will be arrested . Any who resist arrest will be shot , Twice . Oh . Say you have some dissent , please . Not at all , sir . Shall I order a media blackout To keeping anyone from thinking you unsympathetic ? But I am unsympathetic to all those who oppose my will . Send more cameras . Let them remember , It was my will that built from the ashes this nation And put in their mouth the right to complain . But there are limits , now reached . Go do your jobs . Sir . What is the official statement on the fate of David Shepherd ? Who ? You call to mind a much younger Silas . Oh , I know this one . He lives off two hours sleep and the fear of lesser men . He takes what he wants ... And gets thanked for it . Hmm . It 's the old days come again . They never left . Mm . Yeah . Now . Yes . Jack ... oh , forget Jack . No , he 's in hiding from you . So he should be . He 's your son . Hmm ? Who once you held in the palm of your hand , Whose laughter was god 's greatest gift . Not anymore . Jack is the surety under this family 's legacy . Hmm ? He lives , or the crown dies with you . Lucky I don 't die . I built this country with you . I bound it to our family and name . Hmm ? You may have the will ... But I maximize your effect . And tomorrow will be your greatest hour . And you need at least one smile by your side That isn 't trying to hold back the tears . So Jack will stand beside you . He will not be arrested , and he will not be harmed . You will acknowledge him . And you will do this for me . And if I don 't ? You 'll find yourself standing alone . If he behaves , I won 't cut his throat . Interesting turn . I got an unexpected call . Your mother just begged you a pardon from Silas . He should be begging for mine . Good . Be angry . But a king must also learn the value of humility . This offers us an opportunity . For what ? For you to be next to him , Ready when they hate him the most . And then , just as he starts to bark his disgrace ... I come forward . The world will see one king fall And another rise . All it will take is a little pain . Where 's David ? Held temporarily underground Until we can find a more permanent place for him there . Noon tomorrow ... David Shepherd ceases to exist . Time to find a new boyfriend . What if I already did ? What if I found someone and was seen with him ? Let the cameras and the country see that the princess Found someone she likes more than David Shepherd . How he doesn 't mean anything to her , And he shouldn 't to them , either . What a mature young lady you have become . I want to say good-Bye . Better hurry . David . There 's no way to say sorry well enough . You needed me , and I left you . Did you think I was guilty ? No . But there was a reason . I would 've bet my life you 'd be there for me . I did . You didn 't come . I couldn 't . Please just let me explain- - I can 't trust you , michelle . Nothing you say could matter to me . Just keep your reasons . Good-Bye , David . Let 's go , let 's go . Everybody out ! This is such an important day . I 'm so glad you asked me to come . Me too . Are you sure you wouldn 't rather be here With someone else ? I can 't think of anyone as kind . Silas , you 're a murderer ! I 'm proud of you . For bringing paul lash ? Paul lash is just a choice . Most men are . You understand the role you have to play now . For the most part , it won 't be enjoyable . Oh , I know how to play pretty princess . I 've had the role since birth . I mean your new role ... As mother . Hmm ? It changes everything . It makes choices ... Much easier . When it starts to happen , you stay close . Don 't worry . No one ever sees me . That 's a good thing . Look what happens to the ones who need to be seen . He thinks it 's all selfish . Crossgen , our thick pocket lining , Our pockets swell for war . There 's a language to civilization- - And a small group of scholars who can read it . I was born fluent . General benjamin could barely make out the glyphs . As king , he 's lost his glasses . He can 't see that war is just a fuel of progress . Nothing gets made in peace , except art . He changed . I remember when we first met . I really liked him . He used to be so funny . Are you really not going to eat any of that ? I can smell the meat from here . Mm . Shame to waste steak . Thank you . Mm . The girl ? The king 's daughter . Ooh , not bad . It doesn 't matter . The king , in all his wisdom , set me up to die any minute . That was my idea . Sorry about that , David . You know who I am ? Oh , I know lots about you . You gave me back my mind . I was asleep for a long time . I talked to weevils in my mash , Filled books with garbage . And then you came , rose like the sun ... And outshone the world 's brightest star . And then he came to me , And I told him ... I told him To blot you out , Bring back the night , To turn into me . And he listened . And in helping him ... I got my mind back . At some point , he 'll realize that I was up to no good . And boy , he 'll be mad . Who are you ? I am the king . You 're a prisoner . I don 't suppose they tell in school of vesper abadon . Only about his atrocities . Hmm . Interesting fellow with his faults . If he were alive , he 'd probably tell you That there is nothing to be afraid of in death . Were you loved , David ? I 'm not sure . You were . I saw . That 's someone whose heart will die when you do . That 's lucky . Even if it was just skyfire fast . Since I owe you double , Let me give you a parting gift- - Your obol coin in the mouth . It is always better to be loved than feared . Some of us made the mistake the other way , And it does not go well . Die loved . You die happy . I 'd rather live miserable . I like you . It 's time . How ? Firing squad . Gath has arrived , sir . And they said it couldn 't be done . No , they didn 't . And the audience that awaits us ? Handpicked on both sides . I come to beg forgiveness . Forgiveness is a form of love , and I do not love you . Silas ... Yes , you do . Kneel . Kneel . Now kiss the ground I walk on . Silas . Your mouth 's been in dirtier places . That 's the second time your mother 's given you life . It 'll be the last . Last time we met , we weren 't sure who should shake hands first . Well , you 've taken the liberty twice . Now let me be the one to offer my hand . What 's it like , governing when the people have hope ? It 's unusual . And how has it been governing when they 're afraid ? Easier . The men are in position . As soon as Jack makes his move . The people are ready for a new king . So let 's give them one . Captain David Shepherd , By order of the king , you have been condemned to death . What you have to say we are ready to hear . Peace is not a lamb , but a lion . And it requires force and discipline . Otherwise , it will go wild and feed on you . I make no meek apology . History will thank me . You will too . All right , Jack ... do it . The sun says noon . It is time to hand over this territory to Gath . I have only ever lived for peace . I lift my eyes to you . And I know I 'll find it . Our cause is peace . We 've been on a long drift from god . And it is the duty of the leader to sense the tide , and turn the salt-Blind swimmer Towards where we can see the shore . The natives are friendly . Murderer ! Well , not all of them , hmm ? Ready . [ Guns cocking ] Our people have been at odds for too long . But that battle ends today . All battles end today . Aim . Let our land be your land . Peace at any price . Do it , Jack . Fire ! Oh , dear . The king is shot . The king is shot . The king is dead . We have unconfirmed reports that the king was fatally shot . Believed to be the work of the Gath military , Who shot and killed ten civilians during the ceremony . King Silas ' body is currently being taken To an undisclosed location . It is believed That the prince threw himself in front of the assassin 's bullet . The handover at port prosperity Has been cancelled , And the future of peace is in question . You 've come to tell me ... You 've come to tell me he 's dead . Ma 'am . No . He can 't be . I know him . He 's harder than lead . He once looked at a man , and he fell dead of fright . And you would have known this . You see things of this size . Did you see some sign ? No . Silas does not die like this . He ... does not die . Rose ... Rose , he was just a man after all . More so today than ever . Your son and daughter , the country ... They are all going to look to you for how to mourn . Shall we go and see the body ? Silas is not a body ! He is not dead . Any moment , the king will walk through the door . Ah , the king . The king . I didn 't want it to be this way . But we 're here now . I take my place ... His place . As you 've always said , mother , many times ... The people must see us be us , Even when we 're not . We must be a family now . It 's true , then . He 's dead . Mourn if you must . I was worried you wouldn 't make this . It was you . You saved my life . Why ? We 're rid of the poison . My father is gone . It 's my turn to rule , and I want to do it well . I need someone good around here . I will try to do right by your example . I swear to you , from this moment on ... I am your friend . They took from us our best . But we cannot let the work of rogues Impede my father 's best ambition ... Peace . To that end , let it be said , Let it be known , let it be remembered That I , on the day of my melancholy ascension , Saw through that goal . But we needn 't give up our land to achieve that peace . We can reach out to Gath- - Enough ! We suffered enough peacock speeches under him . If there 's to be change , let 's start there . I don 't speak the backwards language of kings , So I 'll talk plain . Silas is dead , Killed by Gath assassins . The media will confirm the story today . Jack will be king . His first order will be to avenge his father 's murder . Gath has never wanted peace with us . They want war , and we will give it to them . Ready our planes to strike . No . Perhaps we should wait . Mourn our loss , Not let grief cloud our good judgment . The country doesn 't want this . They will when we 're attacked ! And Gath will strike right here in shiloh . You can count on it . No . War is not the answer , as king . Sit down , Jack . The reverend was right , grief clouds judgment . Our heir apparent has had a traumatic day . So until he has recovered properly And mourned his loss , I 'll help make his essential decisions . You did this . I 've allied the media , the military ... Now our new king- - All to this purpose . And you used my son . Neither you , nor he , nor any vagrant opinion Will interrupt what- - Now you 've got me doing it . We attack ! Today ! Father . What ? They found his ambulance . There 's no sign of him . Who ? Silas . He 's gone . Where is he ? If he 's alive , he went somewhere to lick his wounds . Someone here knows something . You ? I don 't know , sir . Uh . What about his pilgrimage ? Where 'd he go ? Tell me . Tell me ! Stop this ! No one knows , Not even me . Shot twice , he couldn 't have gotten far . Check every bush and cave . No one leaves this building till I see a body . You were on pilgrimage with him . You know where he is . I can get you out of here . My father had a secure passage built to altar mansion . But he only ever showed the family . Go . David . Be safe . David Shepherd . I need your help . Anything you need . What can we do ? I need to get out . Can you open that gate ? Mother ... Just tell me you didn 't know ... Even if it 's not true . Come ... time to greet your country . Don 't do this , Jack . You don 't know him . He 's alive , I know it . He 's alive . He 'll come back . And he will kill us all . Cameras are ready . Where 's David Shepherd ? Andrew , see if you can find anyone Who knows anything about where he went . If you do , bring them to me . Of course . You come to finish me off ? I 'm not here for that . Or maybe plant a garden ? Jack has named himself king ... But only as a puppet . Cross is the real power . He wants a war with Gath that will never end . Someone had to win . Don 't you understand ? Everything you ever built Will be destroyed unless you go back . I 'm done , boy . Read the signs . What about your country ? Mm . No . You don 't deserve to die loved . You don 't deserve it , you son of a bitch ! Get up ! After all the wrong you 've done to them , To me ! I fought for you ! I believed in you ! We all did ! You told us you were chosen to lead . Was that a lie ? Or did god just make a mistake ? Daddy . Come here , puppy . Are you leaving again ? Remember ... When I said about working for the king ? I am the king .

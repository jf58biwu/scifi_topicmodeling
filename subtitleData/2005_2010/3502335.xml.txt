 There are nearly seven billion people on this planet . Chapter Twelve " An Invisible Thread " Each one , unique , different . What are the chances of that ? And why ? Is it simply biology , Physiology that determines this diversity ? A collection of thoughts , memories , Experiences that carve out our own special place ? Outside Arlington , Virginia Or is it something more than this ? Perhaps there 's a master plan That drives the randomness of creation . Something unknowable that dwells in the soul , And presents each one of us With a unique set of challenges That will help us discover who we really are . You okay ? Did you have a dream ? It 's Nathan . - What about him ? - He 's ... He 's what ? In trouble . He 's not the only one . What is it , Noah ? That construction work we passed about a mile back Wasn 't real . There 's going to be a road block a half a mile or so ahead . This is where you get out . Okay , head two miles in that direction . And then follow the surface streets into the city . What are you going to do ? I 'm going to buy you some time . Here . It 's a secure line . I will find you . Get to Nathan and make sure it is him . He 'll be on Sylar 's trail by now . - But dad , I ... - listen to your father . I love you , Claire bear . Is there a problem , officer ? Nathan Petrelli 's Senate Office , Washington D.C. What are you doing ? I told you , I need you to be taub . I 'm not interested in what you need . I 'm ... Such a waste . You could 've been so helpful . Just didn 't know your place . Eddie , Gordon , send a clean up crew to ... That hurt . Shape-shifting , gotta love it , right ? The changes don 't just happen on the outside , either . You remember that little knife off switch in the back of my head ? I moved it . Go ahead , get it over with . My men will be here any second To collect Petrelli . I know . I got plans for them . I have plans for all of us . You going to kill him ? Later . Right after I absorb all of his memories . It 's a little ability Angela Petrelli Fed me like a snack . Because Nathan ... And by Nathan , I mean I ... Have a rendezvous with destiny tomorrow . The president 's giving a speech at the stanton hotel . Senator Petrelli 's going to be there To have a little meeting with him right afterwards . What for ? Nothing . Just to shake his hand . And when I do ... I 'm going to be the most powerful man in the world . You better kill me now . Because there 's no way i 'm going to let that happen . No , I don 't need to kill you . Because in 30 seconds , There 's not a person on this planet Who 'll believe a word you say . Man down ! Man down ! I 've got him . He 's in here . You son of a bitch . The Capitol Washington D.C. You think there 's a chance he didn 't get caught ? Noah ? No . That was his plan all along . I don 't know how my dad always manages To get himself in the middle of everything . Because he puts himself there . Mostly because of you . You have no idea the lengths a parent will go To ensure the safety of their child . Something I hope you never have to find out for yourself . Now ... This is where I get off . What do you mean ? I just wanted to make sure you got here safely . I 'm not going in there with you to see Nathan . Why not ? Because I need to go find Matt Parkman . Is this about your dream ? In it , Parkman saves Nathan 's life . Okay , so why don 't you just come up And warn Nathan and tell him how to avoid danger ? That 's not how it works . I cannot change what I dreamed . But I can help push its outcome . Now you go find Nathan . And I will find you later . Nathan . Wake up . Wake up . You want to be convincing When you meet the president today , right ? I 'm going to need all those sick little Twisted memories of yours . Such a lightweight . To hell with it . Got plenty of memories from all this stuff You 've got lying around here , anyway . Your diploma says You graduated with honors from Annapolis These cufflinks tell me a different story . Politicians . Sir , someone here to see you . She claims to be your daughter ? All right , send her in . Claire . I 'm glad you finally made it . I was beginning to get worried about you . Did you find him ? Sylar ? Yeah . But he got away . He 's going to the Stanton Hotel To meet the president in an hour . I 'm going to intercept the president first And warn him . And tell him what ? That Nathan Petrelli is a look-alike ? If I have to , yeah . Blow the lid off this whole thing . I 'm going to do whatever it takes to shut down building 26 . And how do I know this is you ? What are you talking about ? How do I know you 're not sylar ? Claire . I am me . We 've spent a lot of time together over the past few days . Mexico . I was beginning to think you knew me better than anyone else . Sorry . It 's all right . Listen . Why don 't you stay here ? I 've got a car taking me to the Stanton Hotel . Lay low until I can clean this whole mess up . No , I want to come with you . In case anything goes wrong . It 's not going to be safe . So what ? I can 't get hurt . And I need to help stop sylar . It 's time I put myself in the middle of this And made a difference . I was thinking exactly the same thing . You 're right . If things do go south , I want you right there . Right by my side . Come on . Building 26 , Washington D.C. How are you feeling ? Better . We don 't have to do this . We can turn around right now I 'm okay.It was just a headache . And a nosebleed You 're getting sick from using your power . Maybe so . But we have to get inside . We must save the ones who are being held . And we must shut down this operation . Then let 's use my power instead . We are a team now . I 'll use my crimson arc to That 's won 't be enough . Look at this security . We have to stop time . No . It 's too dangerous . Just one more time . I promise It 's just a headache now . Next , your head could explode . Explode Really ? Then That 's just the chance I 'll have to take . I bet you 're happy to see me . Sylar ... We 've got to stop him . A lot of help you 're going to be . Okay , let 's hear it . Lecture . The finger-wagging , the general " I told you so . " That I screwed up . Refused to listen . And then you got into bed with Sylar . That 's all over now . Clearly . That 's very zen of you . No , it 's practical . If we get out of here , we 're going to have To throw everybody and everything we have at Sylar , Trying to get a spike into the back of his head . A spike 's not going to cut it anymore . He moved the spot . Great . How the hell did you do it ? Deal with all of this ? Can 't capture all of them , can 't contain them . There are no rules . Not even gravity . It 's all about spinning plates . Living in the gray area . 20 years of middle management , becomes second nature . So in 20 years , I 'll get it ? 20 years and an adopted daughter . If I didn 't have Claire , I 'd be following the same dogma that took you Right over the edge . I 'd be exactly in your position . You are exactly in my position . Yeah . We should do something about that . Together . Good . We have to find where they keep the prisoners . Hiro . Your ear Is bleeding . I 'm fine . Come on . Let 's hurry . Holy crap ! Hiro . It 's Dr.Suresh. Let 's help him down . I have an idea . Payback is very bitchy . Hiro ? Is this a trick ? I don 't know . No guards . Something 's very wrong here . Hiro . Let 's go . Hiro , what- - What happened ? We are rescuing you . I 'll try to repay you later . But right now , we have to get out of here as soon as we can . Are you okay ? No , he 's not . He has nosebleeds and headaches from stopping time . Oh , I 'm fine . You 're a doctor , right ? Then you can help him . Here , open your eyes wide . Your pupils are dilated . Do you have any stiffness in your left arm ? Or dizziness ? Yes . But bruce wayne only slept two hours a night . Hiro ! hiro ... These abilities allow us to do superhuman things , But you are still human . And your human body is rejecting these powers , Like , uh ... like a virus . But this power ... it is what makes me strong . My destiny . You can 't freeze time again. do you understand ? Stanton Hotel Washington , D.C. Thanks . So what 's the plan ? We just tell them the president 's in danger ? That would just send them down a rabbit hole . And then sylar can become a rabbit . So we got to play close to the vest . Follow my lead , okay ? Nathan ! It 's good to see you , man . This is my daughter , claire. claire , this is liam . Samuels. the president 's chief of staff . I live in america . Your dad and I barely survived Boarding school together . Barely . Listen , I really appreciate the president Giving me some time this afternoon . Sure , he just stepped up onstage . Speech usually clocks in about 90 minutes . Whatever works for him . But I 'd like to stick around , close by . Absolutely. we got a suite upstairs . Come here. do me a favor . Sign in right here , and Frank will show you - Nice to meet you . - You too . I thought you were right-handed . Ambidextrous . I bat righty . Throw lefty . You coming ? Prisoners are gone . The entire unit 's been captured . Seeing as how your unit was trying to kill us , I think we caught a break . How the hell did this happen ? I tried to tell you before this whole thing started . Your men alone are never going to be a match For people with abilities . You sure this will work ? Tasers didn 't work on sylar , But one shot of this will put an elephant down . The trick is getting close enough to the elephant . Hiro . Hiro ! call 9-1-1 . I 've got to get to the stanton . I 've got to stop sylar . Go , we 'll stay with him . Hello ? Thank god. where are you ? I 'm with nathan . Are you sure it 's him ? Oh , it 's him. don 't worry . How do you know ? Because it 's me . Oh , god . This is funny . Don 't you love a good pinot ? My dad 's on his way . He 's going to stop you . And then I 'm going to kill you . No . Actually , I 'm going to kill him . Or have you kill him . I haven 't decided yet . Don 't give me that look . Everybody dies sometime . Well ... almost everybody . Papa petrelli , mama bennet ... Mr. muggles . What 's your brother 's name again ? larry ? Lyle . Lyle , right . Hmm , he 's going to die too . As we speak , my father 's dying . Did I tell you I got to meet my real dad ? Boy , was that a disappointment . Have you ever stopped to think about How much we have in common , claire ? You were adopted . I was adopted . You ... can 't die . I can 't die . Oh , you can die . I 'll make sure of it . You 'll get bored . After like , 100 years of trying to off me , Watching all of your loved ones drop like flies . You may eventually come to forgive me . Maybe you 'll even love me . I 'll keep trying to kill you . For the rest of my life . Well , everybody needs a hobby . I mean , I 'm not saying there aren 't bridges That need to be built , But if we start building them now ... Who knows ? You could be my first first lady . I 'm sorry , senator. there 's a full lockdown . No one gets in or out without talking to mr. samuels . Then you better talk to Mr. Samuels . I have senator Nathan Petrelli Requesting access to the building . Is there a problem ? He says you 're already inside . If you 're here , then who the hell 's up in that suite ? I can either know now or after we 've taken him down . You 're not going to do that . You send your men up there , and they will die . He 's right . His name is Sylar. he 's extremely dangerous . And he 's a target ? he 's one of them ? He 's one of them . He 's--got to stop saying that . He 's one of us . He 's one of us . It 's all right . Liam , I 've been lying to the president . I 've been lying to myself . And I will take full responsibility for my crimes When the day comes . But today we 're going to course correct . There 's a man in that suite upstairs , And he needs to be stopped . And how do you suggest we do that ? You don 't . We do . Sylar can only be stopped by people like us . My brother can do whatever sylar can do , We just have to get him close enough to touch him . Just give us a five-minute head start . That 's all I 'm asking . I 'll take him high , you take him low . Let 's cut the son of a bitch in two . I love you , Pete. you know that ? Of course . I love you too , nathan . Ready . Go ! Are you all right ? - Yeah . - Where 'd they go ? The window . Can you fly after them ? I can 't . Come on , we have to find them . Come on . Oh , Claire 's must be so mad at me . WASHINGTON , D.C It 's about time . Mrs. petrelli , what are you doing here ? - Waiting for you. - How did you find me ? I had a dream . Nathan 's in trouble . Something terrible happened to him . And then you save him . I don 't know how . All I know is you have to come with me . I can 't . I 'm sorry . My dreams don 't lie , Mr. Parkman . Now I need you to come with me . I came here to stop those agents from coming after us . I need to be able to go back to my boy , And know he can live his life without being hunted . I 'm sorry about Nathan . Then we want the same thing . And without Nathan , none of that is possible . You don 't have to read minds to know that . Come with me . We should separate here . You go that way , I 'll look for Nathan over here . Hold it . Noah ? You tell me that 's Claire , not Sylar . I just fought Sylar , okay. that is claire . Put the gun down. dad ... It 's me . Did you take his power ? Yeah . So we can stop him . Freeze ! on the ground ! The president 's life is in danger . You want him to live ? you need to listen to us . I said on the ground ! You can either listen to me now , Or I 'll tell you after you shoot me . They were here , Peter and Nathan . I 'm sorry . Only authorized personnel beyond this point . This is a secret service badge . You 're going to let us through . Oh , sorry . You guys go ahead . You don 't want to see this . - no , no , I need to. - mrs. petrelli . - I need to ! - mrs. petrelli , don 't ! No , I need to ! - Nathan ! - Please . Nathan ! I don 't understand . My dream . You were supposed to save him . This way , Mr. president . Nathan . Is that you ? Of course it 's me . we 're getting the president out through the basement . I can 't give you any more time . That 's all right . You don 't have any more time to give . This way , Mr. president . Thank god you 're all right , sir . The secret service did a hell of a job today . And so did you . This is insane . This will never work . - We 'll make it work . - It 's the only way . And it has to be right now . I don 't know how much time I bought Sending Peter and Claire after Nathan . Why don 't you just chain him up , huh ? Or tranq him ; isn 't that what you guys love to do ? I don 't want to be part of this . I thought you came back to protect your family , Matt . I did , but what you 're asking me to do is crazy ! Who will convince the president The whole thing was a mistake ? Without nathan , nothing 's going to change . Word gets out that a person with abilities Murdered a U.S. senator , You 're going to have 100 Dankos out there . Even if I could do what your asking me to do , He would never really be Nathan . He 'd always be Sylar . If Sylar can absorb all of Nathan 's memories , Then the entire history of anything he touches Will fill in the gaps . Physically , no one will ever know the difference . It 'll be permanent . Look , the last thing in the world I want Is to see that son of a bitch still alive , And I have to lie to my family about it . But we need Sylar to be Nathan Petrelli again . Matt ... You don 't do this ... Nathan is gone forever . And how do we explain what happened to him ? There 's a body in deep freeze in building 26 . It 's identical . A shape shifter . Your son , Mr. Parkman- - you just wanted to protect him . Can you honestly tell me that if something happened to him , You wouldn 't do anything- - anything To keep him in your life ? I can 't lose Nathan , not like this . I 'm begging you . You 're no longer Sylar . No longer Gabriel Gray . That life is over . Sylar 's dead . You 're no longer Sylar--Sylar . You 're no longer ... Sylar . No longer Gabriel Gray . Your life is over . Sylar is dead . You 're now Nathan . Petrelli . Nathan Petrelli . Son . Brother . Father . Senator . Nathan . Petrelli . Ma ? We are all connected . Joined together by invisible flame . Infinite in its potential , and fragile in its design . Yet while connected , We are also merely individuals . Empty vessels to be filled with infinite possibilities . An assortment of thoughts , beliefs . A collection of disjointed memories and experiences . It 's a new beginning , mom . Can I be me without these ? Can you be you ? I take it the president agreed to it ? Funding , resources , deniability . I told them I found just the man to head up our new ... What were we going to call it ? I always liked " the company . " Are you feeling okay ? Not really . It 's time for us to go back home , Ando . I can 't believe he 's really dead . He 's really dead , Claire . He really is . And if this invisible threat that holds us together Were to sever , to cease ... what then ? What will become of billions of lone , disconnected souls ? Therein lies the great quest of our lives . To find , to connect ... to hold on . For when our hearts are pure , and our thoughts in line , We are all truly one , Capable of repairing our fragile world And creating a universe of infinite possibilities . END OF VOLUME FOUR . VOLUME FIVE " REDEMPTION " Six weeks later You 're number four . I haven 't heard from you in weeks . I was beginning to worry . Nathan . Sorry , mom . Just haven 't felt like myself lately . Don 't be ridiculous . This is a great time for you , Nathan . The world 's your oyster . We put all that nonsense behind us . The family 's back together . This is your time . Now come on . We 're gonna be late for lunch . Nathan ... have you heard a word I 've said ? It 's just this clock . It 's running a minute and a half fast . so ... lunch ? Italian ? or Chinese ?

We should get to semicorp . Yeah ... yeah , we should . Um , maybe we could go inside first . - Okay . - okay . You have no idea how much I 've longed for this . Good morning , six ! Good morning . We all dream of finding our perfect partner . Well , now , it 's your turn to be matched . I 'm here to tell you about your appoint Appointment with the modern love bureau . You 've gotta be kidding me ! Let science take the risk out of Out of the romance . Our high-tech syst-system Can find you the soul mate you deserve . This came under my door this morning . Well , it 's the way couples get together here . Why don 't you try it ? And what would be the point ? Well , you might meet someone you like . You might learn something about yourself . Or-or maybe you already know everything there is to know About six and his feelings . What is it ? Something to do with the weather . Ambiance anomaly , apparently . Whoa , don 't slip . We usually begin by asking our clients To talk about themselves a little bit In a relaxed but revealing sort of a way . It 's best if you don 't look directly into the camera , As you talk , as it can come over As rather hectoring to a potential match . You really think you can manufacture love ? Since the introduction of blink-match technology , New data shows that extramarital affairs Are down to a new low of 18 % in matched marriages . Blink-match technology . That 's great . We have enough to make a blink personality splice . Blink-match technology . I know what you 're trying to do to me . You 're trying to fix me up with some woman , Some distraction . I 'm not staying here . I must admit , I find it sexy When a man has a touch of rebellion in him . I like the sparks . I have the same thing . I-I like a relationship with a little edge to it . A man with a touch of mystery about him Makes me feel curious about him . What do you think , six ? She 's free tomorrow . Would you like to meet her ? What ? Was that okay ? I just want to- - I want to lie here for a while . Is that okay ? Why not ? Can I let you into a secret ? I looked in your file . I hope you don 't mind . No vacation . No relationships .

I-I-I don 't know what is up with me tonight . That wants to betray him ? No . No part of me . I think there is . Or else , why do it ? Please . Oh , of course , you have no choice in the matter . Let 's not pretend it is otherwise . You are a dreamer , 313 . And dreamers vanish , as you know . But betrayal , it 's such a fascinating human attribute . And since we are passing the time of day here tonight . Do I like you ? I don 't know . You don 't know me . Do you dream ? Do you tell yourself there will be a moment To somehow spring free from all of this And explain to him the impossibility Of your predicament ? You were noble , decent , admirable . You didn 't really forsake him . And you will be a liar . Indulge me . To betray someone you love . And I don 't mean to catch my hand in the filing cabinet . Thursday afternoon in his room ... She denied and doesn 't tell . I mean to fundamentally Betray someone you love . That is ... Would I like you , if I knew you ? I don 't know . I 've long believed that we look for beauty In all the wrong places . You see , if you betray the one person you love , Then there must be something you want more Than to hurt his love . Well , he 'll be with us soon enough . Good morning , six . Time for matching Time for matching stage two . Really ? I 'm not what you expected ? Oh , yes , you are . You 're exactly what I expected . There was something in your voice . I don 't miss that kind of thing . Those matching people know their stuff , huh ? Can I ask you about yourself ? Jump in . What do you wanna know ? I don 't know . Uh , where do you live ? Over the bridge , apartment 415 . But-but you haven 't lived there long ? Ever since I left my parents ' home . Are you sure ? I think I would know . You 're kinda strange , six . I like it . You can ask . It 's okay . How did it happen ? There 's nothing wrong with my eyes . I was six years old . I woke up one morning , and they 'd stopped working . They said it was caused by some kind of trauma . Something happened when I was asleep . Do you mind ? Nice bones . I like . I feel like I know you already , Like we 've met before in some whole other life . Six , you really are strange . But you mean it- - I can hear that . Four-fifteen , I 'd like to get to know you . Well , that 's what we 're here for . I 'd like to get to know you tonight . This isn 't like me , you know , really . Ask anyone who knows me . No surprises . No sudden moves . And then , all this . It 's like the dials are spinning And here I am , letting go . Maybe that 's it . What ? Maybe that 's how love takes us . We should . Okay . What was that ? Oh , the purpose for , um , but then Who needs purpose ? Did anyone tell you You have the most enchanting eyes ? Are you sure you 're okay ? Just some kind of bug . What is it ? What if it 's true ? What if we had ... What if we had one night together In some other life , before the village ? Six , no one can be so hopelessly romantic . What if I know it 's real ? That I can remember it ? Remember us ? Come here . You were standing in the window , Just like this . Lucy ? What did- - what did you call me ? You know something , don 't you ? Well , yes- - I know it 's crazy to talk like this . Some other life . I have to go . I 'm sorry- - I promise you . I won 't talk about these crazy things . I promise you. okay . Let 's just slow it all down , okay ? I 'll go now , and I 'll see you tomorrow . You and me , in this other life , Where did our story end ? I don 't recall . You 're a friend of six 's . Six trusts you . You 'll have to ask him that . I already did . What are they ? I want to know what 's in them , What they do . Look , I 'm not a chemist.I can 't but you can find out for me . I have a question for you . Is six a crazy ? No- - no , he 's not . You want to know about her ? About six ? About holes It 's all right , 1112 . It was always my intention to tell you . I didn 't bargain for six pushing things along . In this , six might has it . If you know , it will change everything . There will be no going back to innocence . I want to know . You want to know . About your mother ? To know about my mother . I should report it , right ? Should I report it ? Could be a way outta here . Cake 's out of the oven ! I 'm gonna have some cake And , uh , then maybe I 'll report it . - Eight-three-two ! - Wee ! I 'll call the clinic before they find out About this thing . She likes you , six . I think it 's the cake she likes . Yeah-yeah , I wanna report something in my garden . How did your date go , six ? She knows something , but she won 't admit it . All righty , who 's going to make the toast ? Even I have to admit There must be something to this matching thing , If it brought you two together . - Cheers . - Cheers . Where 's 8-3-2 ? Eight-three-two ! Eight-three-two ! Eight-three-two ! Eight-three-two ! Eight-three-two ! Hey , what are you doing ? Hey , get off of me ! What are you doing- - my baby is down there ! My baby is down They have to get the child back My baby is in there You left the door open . In the latest move to combat ambiance anomalies , The clinic has announced that every home Is to be given a pig . Studies have shown conclusively That swine breath Is a proven atmosphere stabilizer , And scientists are confident that this will reduce Significantly the risk of further disturbances In the short to medium future . Moreover , if you order now , you can get two . Some friends of mine have lost their child . She 's fallen down into a hole . It 's not the weather ! People want something they can believe in , six . It is the weather . They want to come together and make a difference . They volunteer for pig distribution duties . They love that ! And then , we can all get on with our wonderful lives , Our families , our romances . And what about you , six ? Don 't you have a head full of her , hmm ? Tell the truth- - tell yourself the truth . Wouldn 't you rather be with 4-15 , hmm ? Aren 't you just longing to be at her ? Know what I mean ? At her ? Isn 't that more human ? No . It 's destroying them , My friends , not knowing where their child is . The only way of knowing , The only possibility of getting the child back is to go after her . You choose , you decide . Well , if you 're telling me I can go there and save that little girl , I 'll do it . And you 'd do that without knowing what 's down there , For someone else 's child ? What is this thing ? It 's a nothing . It 's oblivion . It 's beyond all hope . The child is gone , six . Does he not love her enough , now ? Oh , no . He 's hardly begun . What he feels only scrapes at the skin of love . Let him go where love is terrible . Is it possible to love someone too much ? Does he have to come in here every night ? Love is a torment or it is not love . It 'll crack him right open . And then , we can see the six inside , The inside six . He can 't understand why you don 't kill him . Perhaps , we will kill her when we get to that place . How would that feel ? I don 't want you to kill her . We always save our best lies for ourselves . Do I like you ? Come up to the house . Would you like that ? I 'd like you to sit with me . Sit with me and see . What do you make of this holes business , six ? I know it 's got nothin ' to do with the weather . I gotta take this thing seriously , you know ? That 's why we 've got ourselves two pigs . We 're a two pig family . Leave that alone ! Come on- - leave that ! No ! She was such an adventurous kid . Damn , I 've asked myself a thousand times . Why my little girl ? Twenty-nine , forty-four ... Has 4-15 been away in the last few weeks ? Away- - where , son ? We 've seen our little girl every single day Since she was- - since ... What did we do wrong ? Did we not love her enough ? We still hope , you know , for ... that there will be a little miracle . Now that she 's been matched , she 's so happy . Maybe this is it . What do you say , six ? Are you gonna be the one who makes it all good as gold ? What I can tell you , It doesn 't mean that you 'll find her . I have no medical records for your mother . I 've not examined her . I don 't know what her condition is . Her condition is in those pills . A sedative . A cocktail of sedatives . Extremely powerful sleeping drug . A hallucinogen , A type I 've never come across before . It contains a compound that 's not in our records . This is ... well ... This has no known contents . How could they match me with a man like that , huh ? Look at him . He does nothing . Sit with me , 313 . Please , wh-why am I here ? If I touch your hair , You can refuse . We can all refuse . We have choices , So long as we can live with the consequences . Oh , damned consequences , huh ? And if I touch your face , if I touch you here , In this room , she can sense us . I know she can . Oh , it 'd break her heart . I can remove 4-15 , And you can have six all to yourself . No , I want I want him to choose . My question for you is the treatment . Can you do it in reverse ? Can you get rid of this longing ? I 'm not sure . B-but , yes . It must be possible ... The , uh , signs can work in a contrary direction , And we can make someone ... Un-love . She 's right ... I ... do ... nothing ! We will not be doing any such thing , of course . Why should we ? But we know that it is there , you and I , If either of us should ever need it . Go and be with him . That is what you want . They come in the night and take me . I 'm sure of it . No , six . It 's in your mind , that 's all . Three-one-three , Please just help me tonight . I trust you . Stay with me . Two was right . I could 've said no . If you choose her , I don 't know if I can bear that . They 'll , uh ... they 'll be coming soon . So , uh , you just sleep . Just-just sleep . Now see how different he looks . He is ... how shall we describe it ? He is touched . We should be amazed by love , By its capacity to make us and to ruin us . But you , 313 , of course , Look how far it 's brought you . You , who know all about consequences . Oh , 313 . You see what love can do ? 313 , how is it possible ? Your love , six . What is it ? Gene symmetry therapy . We scanned the brains of people who 'd fallen in love . And we discovered ... and you 'll like this , six ... That the more there was gene similarity between people , The more they fell in love . And so , we replicated by transplanting 4-15 's genes into you . I feel ... Your emotions are manufactured , six . But what did I feel Before you gave me these feelings ? If you can do this ... What is love ? You defied me , 313 . A little reckless , perhaps . Your punishment is already in you . And now that you know the way of things , six , Do you still want to marry her ? Do you ? - Yes . - Good . Now ... This isn 't me . Somebody is making this happen . I have to go . One thing first . Breakfast . Tell me what you want for breakfast . Is not the same . If we don 't go , is not that what they want . I just want to buy you breakfast . Oranges . Oranges . Hey ! Where are we going with this ? You tell me . I don 't know ... No . I-I feel like saying- - Marry me . It 'll keep . You like to push it , don 't you , six ? Yes . Marry me . Go ! - Yes . - Yes ? Yes . I look at the joy I bring to so many lives , And I say to myself , " 1891 , " you make a difference . " 313 ... I didn 't think you were comin ' . Six . Okay , um ... Look , there are two kinds of viruses used In gene symmetry therapy . What I gave you , six , it won 't last . 313 , I want you to be my friend . Oh , the veil ! Celebrate with me . What- - what is it ? What 's happening ? did he just kiss her ? Is that what happened here ? Honey- - honey ! You really are rather smitten , Aren 't you , 313 ? What you will never know , of course , Is whether your feelings are genuine or I have to go . I 'm not safe for you to be around . Whatever you do , stay away . We 'll come back to this- - I promise . What 's going on- - are you okay ? What if we said- - what if we promised each other We-we 'd always come back to this ? We 'd never let us go ? Lucy ? Lucy ? Where am I ? We 're in the desert , lucy . Uh , what did you call me ? We 've met before . I know that for you to hear , This might not make any sense . But you 're called lucy . We met in a place called new york . We had one night together . I am 4-15 . Who are you ? I am 4-15 . Who are you ? I am 4-15 . Who are you ? I am Lucy . I-I am Lucy . I 'm Lucy , I 'm Lucy . Why did you do that- - the blindness ? Be-because they knew if I looked at you , You would know that they sent me here . I came here to love you . No ! I 'm cured of you ! You tell me why you 're here ! Two brought me here to love you . Two brought me here to break your heart . I 'm glad you 're cured of me . 147 ? I 'm gonna find my little girl , six . But there 's nothing down there . Nothing . If what you want is oblivion , then jump . Do it . If it 's too much for you to bear , go . But don 't lie to yourself . Don 't lie to your wife . You 're not gonna find your daughter . She 's gone . Tell me you know that and you still wanna jump . I can accept that , my friend . I 'll watch you go . You love your wife . You could save her .

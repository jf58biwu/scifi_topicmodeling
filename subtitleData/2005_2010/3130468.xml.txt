 Sync : FRM @ ¹ âÏË * * * * * * * * * * * * the world will have to deal with us . previously on the 4400 ... these shots are free . give them to anyone who wants them , but be careful to explain the risks . handing out promicin like candy changes everything , shawn . nobody can predict what 's going to happen once people everywhere start developing abilities . april ! how 's it going , sibling ? april skouris , black sheep of the family . you don 't really know this girl at all , do you ? the whole time we were planning our wedding , you were working with ryland , betraying me- - where 's the promicin ? get your hands off of me . he 's stable . that 's the good news . but he hasn 't regained consciousness . they don 't know when he will . i have a job offer in spain . if you come with me . if collier 's right , if moving into this new world of his means more upheaval in the here and now , i 'm going to find myself a place where i can live at peace with my daughter as long as i can . alana 's picture 's gone out to every hospital and law enforcement agency in the country . nobody 's seen her , tom . i 'm sorry . hey , kyle ! you ready ? come on , buddy . it 's starting soon . you think i 'd be late for this ? i 'm as psyched as you are , dad . good , let 's do it , then . tom ... ? tom i saved you some seats . sorry . hey , tom . hey , maia . you look nice . thank you . you said you 'd be late , so i held things up for you . yeah . hey ... hey , guys . hey , how are you doing ? hey , how are you ? hi , tess . hi , honey . good to see you . kevin ... how are you ? i thought you 'd never make it . well , i had a little help . oh ... thank you , thank you . i appreciate the applause , even though i know who it 's really for . we 're all here to give thanks to one man , a man who took a dark and dangerous world and healed it . a man who eliminated disease and war and changed our ideas of what it is to be a human being . he made 4400 abilities available to everyone , and all of our lives are better for it . some call him a savior , some call him a messiah . he 's all that and more . ladies and gentlemen , mr. jordan collier . today , this morning , here and everywhere , it is good to be alive ! united like humanity has never been united . through promicin , the gift i brought you , and that you accepted . together , we have created heaven on earth , a time of joy , endless joy , that we share as one . and for that , i say let us bow our heads in thanks . jordan ... jordan ! it 's okay . it was a dream . you were dreaming ... again . what was it about this time ? i , uh ... i handed out the promicin . i stopped the catastrophe . well , it was the right thing to do . we saved the future from- - i know what kind of world i prevented . but is the world i created any better ? mm ... more , please . that is so disgusting . you said you wouldn 't do that in front of me anymore . it 's gross . it 's not disgusting . it 's love , and one day , you 'll understand . so , mommy , when are you going to tell us ? tell us what ? mommy got the job offer . the job with the european union came through ? she 'll be advising them on all things 4400 . they said we could live anywhere in the e.u. the benefit package is unbelievable . wow . okay . is there anything the job doesn 't come with ? yeah , a gun , which makes it just about perfect . if i take this , it means that we 're not just on vacation anymore . i mean , we have to settle down somewhere . so how about it ? is everyone ready to put down some roots ? kyle ... hey , dad . when did you get back into town ? why didn 't you call me ? honestly ? um ... the way things left off , i wasn 't sure you wanted to hear from me . kyle , you said you wanted some distance . i was trying to respect that , but you should know you ... you can talk to me any time . i start this new job tomorrow . it 's a legal aid thing helping out the 4400 . i was going to get a hotel , you know , while i looked for an apartment , but it just seemed kind of stupid you being here all by yourself , you know ? still no word on alana ? no . hmm . i could use some company . yeah . i 'm sorry she 's gone , dad . i really liked her . she loved you . yeah , i know . yeah , i , uh ... i keep hoping that i 'll come home some day , and she 's just going to be here . i 'm going to go unpack . is that all right ? i want to go see shawn later . kyle ? welcome home . thanks . the good news is i 'm not dead . i took the shot three days ago and i 'm still here . the bad news ? i can 't blow things up with my mind , or fly , or do anything differently at all . i 'm still just me . graham. a.k.a. no one . okay , so , i kind of want to go to the prom with jeff . ? yeah ? amber ! ? i didn 't know , but- - amber ... such a stupid geek . ? oh , my god . all right , guys , get in here . time to pick teams . come on , move it . line up over here , guys . come on , mike ! you 're always the last one . hurry up ! graham . i want graham . me ? wait a minute . i 'm taking graham . guys , come on . stop messing with me . everyone knows i suck at basketball . listen up . if graham doesn 't want to shoot hoops , then hoops is off the menu . so how about it , graham ? what do you want to play ? you 're serious ? absolutely . we can play whatever you want . just tell us what to do . um , thumb wrestling ? all right , thumb wrestling it is . ? pair up ! you two over here , come on , come on , move it ! you two guys , over here . mike , you and billy over here . what 's going on ? say hello to the new head of ntac . i don 't get it . the woman doesn 't have a single day of law enforcement experience . she works in a think tank for a few years , so they give her a gun and a badge and tell her to go play sheriff ? yeah , well , i heard she managed the flow of refugees after the hurricanes in texas , and did a good job of it , too . she 's a political appointment . probably smiled at the right person at some cocktail party , so they passed over all the qualified people . oh , and , tom , she said she wanted to see you as soon as you got in . hi. i 'm- - tom baldwin . i know . meghan doyle . hi . does that look straight to you ? yeah , yeah , yeah , sure . it looks good . you must like subtitles . have you ever seen la dolce vita ? honestly ? no. no . i 'm getting the distinct impression no one else around here has either , but that 's okay . you should check it out , though . okay , i 'll do that . relax , tom . it 's not homework . please , come and sit down . there 's something i want you to see . something to get us off on the right foot . open it . it 's interesting . you do know i 'm not cleared to read this ? oh , of course , but i 've read your file . you don 't seem like the kind of agent who 'd let that bother you . go ahead . i won 't tell if you won 't . this is all about isabelle tyler . why are you showing me this ? she can have visitors now . i figured you might want to see her . i know you 've been looking for alana mareva for three months . i also know that you 're at a dead end . you must have considered the possibility that she was abducted again . of course . people don 't just fall off the edge of the planet . isabelle tyler is the one person alive with a tangible connection to the future . if they did take alana , maybe isabelle will be able to tell you something . you sure this isn 't going to blow back on you ? i mean , you just started . i don 't want to get you in trouble . if i succeed in this job , if i bring in jordan collier , no one 's going to mind if a few rules are broken along the way , and if i don 't , no amount of toeing the line will save me . i appreciate this . thanks . you know those posters . you have a taste for foreign films , people think you 're some kind of intellectual or a radical . the truth is , i just like the movies . are you sure you don 't like that they make people uncomfortable ? maybe that , too . hey , buddy . can you hear me ? hey ... my dad says when i was in a coma , he used to talk to me all the time . i don 't remember any of it , but who knows ? maybe it helped . i wish there was something i could do for you . i tried . three months ago , i took the shot . i was so scared , but i just did it anyway . i was thinking maybe i could wake you up . same as you did for me . want to hear the punch line ? nothing happened . ba-dum-bum , spssh ! three months , no ability . nothing . i mean , nothing . nothing 's changed at all , really . that 's weird , huh ? i tried . i 'm sorry . hello ? excuse me . are you lost ? help me . there are dead people everywhere i go . they hate me . i made them dead . we made them dead . tess , we gave them a choice . we didn 't force the shots on anyone . tess ... i want you to take your medication . all right ? it 'll make you feel better . come on , come on . kevin ... she 'll calm down once she 's had her pills . is that your medical opinion ? tess is schizophrenic . the strain of hiding out , the guilt over what we did , she can 't handle it . it 's caused a break . she needs medical care beyond what we can provide . till i find a doctor sympathetic to us , you 'll have to administer her medications yourself . well , you just remember , tess ' ability is what keeps you safe . if it wasn 't for her , you 'd have been arrested a long time ago . and i promise you , i don 't care if the fate of the world is at stake , i will not sacrifice tess to you . or your cause . our cause , kevin . ours . hey , guys . what 's up ? all of us were talking , and we just want you to know we 're with you . all of us . we believe . in what ? in you . we 're not the only ones . we brought someone . oh , my god . amber ? what are you doing here ? i came to be with you . what the hell is going- - whoa . amber , wait a minute . you know those shots you always hear about on the news ? i took them . i think maybe it 's screwing you guys up . no , graham , it 's you . we want to be close to you . we want to be close to the light . what light ? the one that shines out of you . i didn 't see it until today , but now i do . it 's beautiful . you 're beautiful . £ ¿ £ ¿ THEY TOLD YOU TO KILL ME . YOU DIDN 'T DO IT . DID YOU EVER THINK MAYBE THAT 'S WHY YOUR GIRLFRIEND 'S GONE ? IT 'S YOUR PUNISHMENT ? IS THAT SOMETHING YOU THINK , OR IS THAT SOMETHING YOU KNOW ? HOW 'S SHAWN ? ANY CHANGE ? NO . HE 'S IN A REGULAR HOSPITAL NOW . LONG-TERM CARE . WHAT ABOUT MY FATHER ? HAS ANYBODY HEARD FROM HIM ? NO , HE 'S ON OUR LIST , AND WE 'LL FIND HIM . NOW , ISABELLE , IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ALANA , PLEASE TELL ME . JUST TELL ME , PLEASE ! YOU WANT TO HAVE HOPE , DON 'T YOU ? YOU WANT TO BELIEVE SHE 'S COMING BACK . OF COURSE . THEN YOU DON 'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT I KNOW . I 'M SORRY , TOM . I REALLY AM , BUT THEY USED YOU . THE SAME WAY THEY USED ME . HOLA ? HEY , DIANA . IT 'S ME , MARCO . ARE-ARE YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME IN SPAIN ? YEAH , HEY , MARCO ! YEAH , NO , EVERYTHING 'S GOOD . ARE YOU OKAY ? YEAH . YEAH , I-I 'M GOOD . UH , SOMETHING CAME UP , THOUGH . A COUPLE DAYS AGO , SOME AGENTS RAIDED AN APARTMENT . THERE WAS A LOT OF PROMICIN THERE . ONE OF THE GUYS THEY BROUGHT IN GAVE UP A WHOLE BUNCH OF NAMES . YOU KNOW , PEOPLE THEY 'D GIVEN SYRINGES TO ? OKAY , SO WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO TELL ME , MARCO ? UH ... ONE OF THE NAMES WAS APRIL SKOURIS . MY SISTER TOOK THE SHOTS ? THE GUY DIDN 'T KNOW IF SHE ACTUALLY INJECTED THEM , BUT SHE DEFINITELY HAD THEM . HAVE YOU HEARD FROM HER ? NO , I-I HAVEN 'T HEARD FROM HER IN MONTHS . SHE DIDN 'T CALL ME ON MY BIRTHDAY , BUT I FIGURED , APRIL , YOU KNOW ? YEAH , I REMEMBER . LOOK , I 'M SORRY , DI . I JUST ... YOU KNOW , I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW . I APPRECIATE IT . THANKS . BYE . YOU 'RE GOING BACK TO SEATTLE , AREN 'T YOU ? THAT USED TO BE A STATUE OF OUR NAMESAKE . LAST NIGHT , A DOZEN STUDENTS TORE IT DOWN AND PUT THAT THING UP . WHEN WE ASKED THEM WHY , THEY SAID IT WAS A STATUE OF GRAHAM HOLT . WHO 'S GRAHAM HOLT ? HE 'S A JUNIOR . C STUDENT . BASICALLY UNREMARKABLE IN EVERY WAY . SO THIS KID PULLS A PRANK , AND YOU CALL NTAC ? I CALLED NTAC BECAUSE I THINK MAYBE THIS KID TOOK SOME OF THOSE SHOTS . I MEAN , WHAT 'S GOING ON AROUND HERE ISN 'T NORMAL . THE POSTERS , THE STATUE . LAST NIGHT , OUR VALEDICTORIAN REVISED HER APPLICATION ESSAY TO STANFORD . SHE READ IT TO HER GUIDANCE COUNSELOR THIS MORNING . IT 'S 500 WORDS ON HOW GRAHAM HOLT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL LEADER . SINCE THE TIME OF CHRIST . I CALLED HIM INTO MY OFFICE EARLIER THIS MORNING . HE CLAIMS TO HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT WHAT 'S GOING ON . WELL , I THINK WE NEED TO MEET THIS GRAHAM HOLT . FROM NOW ON , EVERYONE 'S FAVORITE BAND IS TV ON THE RADIO . GOT THAT ? TV ON THE RADIO . THEY 'RE THE BEST BAND OUT THERE . EXCUSE ME . EXCUSE ME . GRAHAM ? THESE GENTLEMEN WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU . I 'M AGENT BALDWIN . THIS IS AGENT GARRITY . WE WORK AT NTAC . OKAY . WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO COME WITH US . WE 'RE GOING TO BRING YOU IN TO NTAC AND WE 'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A TEST TO SEE IF YOU 'RE PROMICIN POSITIVE . WHY ? LOOK AROUND YOU , GRAHAM . I THINK YOU KNOW WHY . DO I HAVE A CHOICE ? YOU HAVE A CHOICE WHETHER OR NOT YOU DO IT IN HANDCUFFS . IF YOU HAVEN 'T TAKEN THE SHOT , YOU DON 'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT . NOW , COME ON . YOU 'RE SITTING IN MY SPOT . I DIDN 'T REALIZE THESE BENCHES WERE ASSIGNED . WELL , THEY ARE . LITERALLY . I 'M IN MY FIRST YEAR AT THE INSTITUTE . ART AND DESIGN ? I 'M SUPPOSED TO DO A CHARCOAL SKETCH OF A VIEW FROM THE PARK EVERY DAY FOR SEVEN DAYS . YOU 'RE IN MY SPOT . OKAY . I 'LL MOVE . I 'LL MOVE . THANKS , KYLE . I APPRECIATE THAT . HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME ? HONESTLY ? I RECOGNIZED YOU AS SOON AS I WALKED UP . I READ A LOT ABOUT THE 4400 . WHICH MEANS I READ A LOT ABOUT YOU . SO I GUESS YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT ME AND JORDAN COLLIER , HUH ? YEAH , I DO . KIND OF HARD TO AVOID . WELL , YOU KNOW IT WASN 'T ME WHO SHOT HIM , RIGHT ? NOT REALLY ME . I DIDN 'T REALLY BELIEVE IT WAS YOU . YOU DIDN 'T LOOK LIKE A KILLER TO ME . WELL , I GUESS THAT 'S A KIND OF COMPLIMENT . THANK YOU . I HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK , BUT GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR ASSIGNMENT . CASSIE ... DUNLEAVY . MAYBE I 'LL SEE YOU AROUND . I 'LL BE HERE FOR THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS . SEEMS TO ME THERE 'S A VERY SIMPLE EXPLANATION FOR WHAT 'S GOING ON AT STEVENSON HIGH . THIS KID , GRAHAM , TOOK THE PROMICIN SHOT , AND NOW EVERYONE WHO MEETS HIM THINKS HE 'S GOD . COME ON , COME ON . I 'VE HEARD YOU TEND TO MOVE DIRECTLY TO THE POINT , MARCO , BUT REALLY , GOD ? WELL , OBVIOUSLY , HE 'S NOT THE GOD . AT BEST , HE 'S A GOD , A MINOR DEITY . WHATEVER . THESE KIDS ARE BUILDING EFFIGIES OF HIM . THEY 'RE WILLING TO FIGHT US TO PROTECT HIM . SOUNDS LIKE WORSHIP TO ME . YOU TWO GUYS ARE LUCKY YOU WEREN 'T TURNED . IT SEEMS LIKE YOU ONLY NEED A COUPLE MINUTES AROUND GRAHAM BEFORE YOU FIND RELIGION . MAYBE THEY 'RE UNLUCKY . ABSOLUTE DEVOTION IS A RARITY IN THE MODERN AGE . IT MIGHT BRING A REAL SENSE OF PURPOSE TO LIFE . A CLARITY . GUYS , WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS KID ? WE GO BACK WITH MORE PEOPLE . WE ISOLATE HIM , HOPE THE EFFECTS WEAR OFF . BUT I 'D DO IT FAST . IT SOUNDS LIKE GRAHAM 'S PRETTY MUCH FOCUSED ON BEING KING OF THE SCHOOL . I MEAN , IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS IF HE LEARNS TO THINK A LITTLE MORE AMBITIOUSLY . WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ? ARE YOU HERE TO GIVE YOURSELVES BODY AND SOUL TO GRAHAM HOLT ? NOT EXACTLY . THEN I SUGGEST YOU LEAVE . THESE STREETS ARE HIS . WE 'LL DEFEND THEM WITH OUR LIVES . JUST TAKE YOUR MEN AROUND THAT WAY . THIS IS ME , GRAHAM . WHAT DO YOU WANT ? I WANT YOU TO END THIS , GRAHAM . IF YOU DON 'T COME OUT OF THERE , THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET HURT . THAT WHAT YOU WANT ? NO , OF COURSE NOT . THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST TRYING TO PROTECT ME . YOU 'RE FORCING THEM TO BE HERE . YOU 'VE TAKEN AWAY THEIR FREE WILL . THEIR LIVES ARE IN YOUR HANDS . I UNDERSTAND . I DON 'T WANT ANYTHING BAD TO HAPPEN TO THEM , EITHER , BUT YOU JUST NEED TO GIVE ME SOME TIME . LIKE , A NIGHT TO FIGURE THIS OUT . OKAY ? ONE NIGHT . I JUST BOUGHT US SOME TIME . WE 'VE GOT PLANNING TO DO . HEY ... TRY NOT TO LOOK SO GLOOMY , OKAY ? AND WHO KNOWS ? SHE MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO GET INTO SEATTLE . SHE 'D BE RIGHT BACK HERE IN A COUPLE HOURS . SHE 'S NEVER COMING BACK HERE . SHE SAID SHE IS , MAIA , AND I REALLY NEED TO BELIEVE THAT . SO , KYLE , TELL ME , YOU EVER GO VISIT YOUR COUSIN , SHAWN ? HASN 'T BEEN MUCH IN THE PAPER ABOUT HIM LATELY . IS HE GETTING ANY BETTER ? NO , HE 'S NOT , WHICH IS WEIRD , BECAUSE THE DOCTORS SAY THERE 'S NO REASON WHY HE SHOULDN 'T BE AWAKE . HIS BRAIN 'S ACTIVE , HIS VITAL SIGNS ARE OKAY . THAT 'S SO SAD . HE SEEMED LIKE A REALLY GOOD GUY . EVERYONE 'S JUST GIVEN UP . SETTLING IN FOR THE LONG HAUL . DIDN 'T I READ SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROMICIN IN HIS SYSTEM ? THE DOCTORS THINK IT 'S ALL OUT OF WHACK ? THAT 'S RIGHT . THEY THINK THAT 'S WHY HE ... HIS BODY SHUT DOWN , BUT I DON 'T THINK THAT MADE IT INTO THE PAPERS . WELL , IT MUST HAVE . HOW ELSE WOULD I KNOW ABOUT IT ? OKAY , I KNOW I 'M NOT A DOCTOR , BUT MAYBE SOMEONE SHOULD TRY INJECTING HIM WITH A BIG OLD DOSE OF PROMICIN . IT 'D BE LIKE GIVING HIM A JUMP START , RIGHT ? SHAWN 'S A 4400 . PROBABLY WOULDN 'T HURT HIM . YEAH , I 'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT . THE DOCTORS WON 'T EVEN CONSIDER IT . PROMICIN IS SERIOUSLY ILLEGAL . TOO BAD YOU CAN 'T GET YOUR HANDS ON ANY . YOU MIGHT BE THE ONLY PERSON IN HIS LIFE WHO CARES ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY TAKE A SHOT AT WAKING HIM UP . THEY 'VE JUST BEEN STANDING HERE STARING AT US FOR HOURS . DON 'T THEY EVER HAVE TO USE THE BATHROOM ? HEAD 'S UP . DON 'T SHOOT ! MY NAME 'S GRAHAM HOLT . I WANT TO SURRENDER . IT 'S ABOUT TIME . HANDS UP . KEEP YOUR HANDS UP . ALL RIGHT , ON YOUR KNEES . EASY ... IT 'S NOT HIM ! IT 'S NOT HOLT ! DON 'T SHOOT ! MY NAME 'S GRAHAM HOLT . ON YOUR KNEES ! I WANT TO SURRENDER . NOW ! ON YOUR KNEES ! DON 'T SHOOT ! I 'M GRAHAM HOLT- - I 'M GRAHAM HOLT .

I JUST WANTED TO SAY , YOU HAVE NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF . BELIEVING IN ME DOESN 'T MAKE YOU A DIFFERENT PERSON . YOU 'LL STILL LOVE YOUR FAMILY . YOU 'LL STILL WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND GO DO WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO . YOU 'LL JUST HAVE MORE PURPOSE , AND EVERYONE WILL BELIEVE EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO , AND YOU 'LL BELIEVE WHAT THEY DO . TESS ! TESS ! IT 'S ALL GOING TO BE VERY COOL . I PROMISE . SHE 'S GONE . JUST OPEN UP YOUR HEARTS AND LET ME IN . SHE MUST HAVE LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT . HEY , EVERYONE . MY NAME IS GRAHAM HOLT . DID YOU HEAR ME ? SHE 'S GONE . I JUST WANTED TO SAY- - JORDAN ! WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? WE HAVE TO FIND HER BEFORE SOMEONE PICKS HER UP . YOU 'LL HAVE TO GO WITHOUT ME . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , " GO WITHOUT YOU " ? THIS IS TESS . YOU OWE HER . I DID NOT GIVE OUT PROMICIN TO THE WORLD TO HAVE IT UNITE UNDER A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY . ... AND YOU 'LL BELIEVE WHAT THEY DO . HE HAS TO BE STOPPED . IT 'S ALL GOING TO BE VERY COOL , I PROMISE . OH ... I SEE . YOU 'RE HAVING MESSIAH ENVY . HOW ARE YOU GOING TO STOP HIM , JORDAN ? ANYBODY WHO GETS NEAR THAT KID WINDS UP PRAYING TO HIM . WHAT MAKES YOU ANY DIFFERENT ? AND EVEN IF YOU COULD GET CLOSE TO HIM , WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN ? A MIRACLE ? I GUESS I NEED ONE , DON 'T I ? ... WHATEVER YOU DO , YOU 'LL JUST HAVE MORE PURPOSE , AND EVERYONE WILL BELIEVE EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO , AND YOU 'LL BELIEVE WHAT THEY DO . IT 'S ALL GOING TO BE VERY COOL , I PROMISE . ARE YOU GUYS NUTS ? I 'M AN NTAC AGENT ! WE 'RE ON THE SAME SIDE ! HEY , COME ON , COME ON ! GUYS , GUYS- - HEY ! HEY , HEY ! ? THEY 'RE ARRESTING EVERYBODY AT NTAC . WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? WHY ? OUR ORDERS ARE TO BRING YOU ALL DOWNTOWN , SIR . GRAHAM WANTS TO BRING NTAC INTO THE FOLD . FINE . FINE . SOUNDS GOOD . WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE , HUH ? ARE YOU OKAY ? YEAH . GRAHAM CONVERTED A COUPLE OF POLICE STATIONS . THE COPS ARE ARRESTING PEOPLE , BRINGING THEM TO HIM BY THE HUNDREDS . I 'M THE KING OF SEATTLE ! KYLE , WHY AREN 'T YOU PICKING UP THE PHONE ? I TOLD YOU IT 'S DANGEROUS OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW . NOW , CALL ME BACK . STILL NO WORD FROM YOUR SON ? NO . WHAT DID D.C. SAY ? NOTHING GOOD . THEY 'RE ALREADY TALKING ACCEPTABLE LOSSES , AIR STRIKES , SENDING AN ARMY DIVISION INTO THE CITY . THEY 'RE GOING TO INVADE AN AMERICAN CITY ? SOUNDS A LOT LIKE CIVIL WAR TO ME . ? BEST I COULD DO WAS BUY US A COUPLE HOURS . TO DO WHAT ? WE HAVE TO GATHER EVERYONE FROM NTAC THAT HASN 'T BEEN CONVERTED , MAKE OUR WAY DOWNTOWN , FIGHT OUR WAY DOWNTOWN IF WE HAVE TO . WE 'LL TRY AND GET CLOSE TO GRAHAM . WE 'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET TO HIM BEFORE HE GETS TO US . OH , MY GOD . SHAWN ! WHAT HAPPENED ? I DON 'T KNOW . HE WAS JUST LYING THERE AND HE STARTED CONVULSING . OH , MY GOD ... HEY , COME ON . HEY , SHAWN . HEY ... HEY , IT 'S US . IT 'S KYLE . SHAWN ? SAY SOMETHING IF YOU 'RE OKAY . COME ON . MOM ? HOW DID I GET HERE ? MR. COLLIER ... YOU DID THE RIGHT THING COMING TO ME . IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SHAME IF I HAD TO TRACK YOU DOWN . SEEMS THE WORLD IS FALLING AT YOUR FEET . I WANTED TO SEE WHY . DON 'T WORRY . SOON , IT 'S ALL GOING TO MAKE PERFECT SENSE TO YOU . NO . I GAVE YOU PROMICIN . I CAN TAKE IT AWAY . WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME ? I MADE YOU ORDINARY . SHOOT HIM ! SHOOT HIM NOW ! JUSTIN ! MARK ! THE WORLD DOESN 'T NEED YOU ANYMORE . IT HAS ME . GET ON WITH YOUR LIVES . GRAHAM SHOULDN 'T HAVE CONVERTED SO MANY COPS . ONE OF HIS FORMER FOLLOWERS ARRESTED HIM RIGHT THERE , ON THE STEPS OF THE COURTHOUSE . AND THERE 'S NO TRACE OF PROMICIN IN HIS SYSTEM ? NOTHING ? NO , HE 'S JUST A HIGH SCHOOL KID WITH A LOT TO ANSWER FOR . I GUESS WE CAN ALL STOP WONDERING IF COLLIER HAS AN ABILITY . HE CAN NEUTRALIZE PROMICIN . I DON 'T GET IT . SHAWN NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT COLLIER DOING THAT TO ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 4400 . MAYBE IT DOESN 'T WORK ON THEM . MAYBE HE CAN ONLY DO IT TO THE EXTRA CRISPIES . EXTRA CRISPIES , YOU KNOW , LIKE , NOT THE ORIGINAL RECIPE 4400 ? PEOPLE WHO TOOK THE PROMICIN SHOT AND THEN GOT AN ABILITY . SO COLLIER WALKED INTO WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY AN OCCUPIED SEATTLE , LAID HANDS ON THIS KID , AND SOLVED A PROBLEM THAT HAD THE ENTIRE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN A PANIC . IF I WAS SITTING AT HOME , WATCHING THIS STORY ON THE 6 : 00 NEWS , YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I 'D BE THINKING ? PEOPLE WERE PRAYING TO THE WRONG GUY . COLLIER JUST POSTED A MESSAGE ON THE INTERNET . WE ALL HAD A SCARE TODAY . WE 'LL HAVE OTHERS BEFORE WE 'RE DONE . WE ... WE 'RE WALKING A DIFFICULT AND A DANGEROUS PATH , BUT WE 'RE WALKING IT TOGETHER . WHETHER YOU 'VE CHOSEN TO JOIN ME OR NOT , WE 'RE ALL , EVERY ONE OF US , MAKING HISTORY NOW . TOM ... I GOT A CALL FROM THE WARDEN AT KURLAND PRISON . THERE 'S A MESSAGE FOR YOU FROM ISABELLE TYLER . THAT 'S IT ? THE POWELL MUSEUM ? SHE SAID YOUR ANSWER 'S THERE , AND YOU 'LL KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE IT . THANKS . THE TIME FOR SITTING ON THE FENCE IS OVER . THE TIME FOR GREATNESS IS NOW . EACH OF YOU HAS A ROLE TO PLAY . YOUR ONLY CHOICE IS WHETHER YOU ACCEPT IT OR HAVE IT THRUST UPON YOU . PROMICIN IS OUT THERE . PEOPLE ARE GAINING ABILITIES , AND NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT ... I 'M SORRY , SIR . THERE 'S NO STUDENT NAMED CASSIE DUNLEAVY REGISTERED AT THIS SCHOOL- - ? SHE SAID SHE 'S A STUDENT HERE . I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO HER . ? I CAN 'T FIND HER ANYWHERE- - MAYBE SHE DIDN 'T GIVE YOU HER REAL NAME . HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF THAT ? THE GENIE WILL NOT GO BACK INTO THE BOTTLE . I KNOW IT 'S TEMPTING TO THINK THAT WE CAN HOLD ON TO THE PAST , TO EVERYTHING THAT 'S SAFE AND EASY , BUT WE CANNOT , AND SAFE AND EASY ARE WHAT SET US ON THE PATH TO CATASTROPHE IN THE FIRST PLACE . THE CHAINS OF COMFORT ARE WHAT KEEP US FROM REACHING FOR A BETTER WORLD . THIS NEW ERA , IT 'S NOT COMING , IT 'S NOT ON THE WAY , * * * * * * * * * * * *

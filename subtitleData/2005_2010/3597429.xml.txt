 Sync by honeybunny You okay there ? Do I look okay to you ? What do they call ya ? They call me " Six . " Well , Six , it 's not wise to hang around here . Well , I wouldn 't wanna be not wise , would I ? You could always walk . This may take some explaining . Can I .. can I get another drink ? A man finds himself senseless in some back alley . I 'd say he has a problem with the drink or trouble with a lover . My guess it 's a lover . Oh ! You have a knack I 've noticed . You talk a lot , and the more you talk , the less you say . Is that something they teach you ? It 's-it 's nerves . You make me .. you make me nervous . We 're here and we 're staying here , so you can talk all you want but we 're not leaving until you tell me two things . Who are you and what do you want ? Come on , why me ? That 's three things . Where is this place ? You 've had an invitation . Oh , thank you , for coming , Six . 909 here , He 's an undercover , one of our best . I thought you might 've noticed that . I want you to work with 909 , Six . You think I 'd work for you ? Oh , no-no-no , not for me , for them , for the people you would be watching . You 've announced so loudly your opposition to me , your disbelief of everything we stand for . They might trust you . We already have our suspects , and I know you want to make contact with dreamers . I offer you the apparatus and expertise of our highly trained and well financed undercover operations to do just that . Why would you give me all that , if it wasn 't a trap ? Oh , my dear Six , it is a trap . You have such a high opinion of yourself . I wondered if you would be clever enough to turn this opportunity to your own advantage . Stil .. Everything you say is a trap . All right . Let 's do it . Hello ? Undercover 's work in cells : twos , threes , fours . You and I are a cell . First rule , you tell no one about your cell . We don 't know the other cells . They don 't know us . That means everyone could be an undercover ... every single person in the village . So , someone could be investigating you , right now , another undercover cell . It 's a possibility . Yeah , I suppose . There 's our suspect . His number is 19-55 . And what makes him a suspect ? We had a report . How do I find out if he 's a dreamer ? Get close . You have a position here . Teacher . You start today . Be careful , 19-55 might be an undercover himself . He may be compiling a dossier on you . Uh-uh , they 're with me for history first session . 16-34 has them for math after that . Then , it 's sports . I don 't see the point myself , really . And then , they 're with you , uh , for surveillance techniques all afternoon . Doesn 't that seem a bit odd , Teaching surveillance to kids ? Why should it ? It 's your subject . No reason . And who can tell me which number Two oversaw the reformation . Sir , it was Two the 14th . It was , indeed . And who can tell me the first woman number Two ? Put your hand down , 1,100 . Sir , was it lady number Two the great ? Who was number One ? Ah , the oldest question in village history . Go on , 1,100 , you tell them . There is no number One . There never has been , and there never will be . The concept of the number Two is an act of humility . The title reminds us all that we are all public servants , Even number Two . No one is number One . Very , very good . * * None of my friends have a relationship with their father like ours . That 's good . Isn 't it ? I 'm certainly glad of it . Perfect . It is as it is ... as it should be . 19-55 , can you keep a secret ? You 're an oddity , Six . I have these crazy thoughts . What if there was some other place , You know , outside the village ? How mad is that ? I 'm one of those lucky people who doesn 't need distraction . Uh , no wife , no family . I 'm not interested in alcohol or gambling . Sports , cigarettes , no . No , everything I need is right here . * when I was Six , I started picking up sticks * Is everybody here living in fear ? Yes . No-no-no . It doesn 't .. It doesn 't have to be like that . Good and bad , right and wrong , the people here , they get on with it . They have jobs . They clean the streets , they - they wait on tables . They work in hospitals . They look out for their neighbors . They 're decent , ordinary people . They - they fall in love ... have kids ... normal lives . What 's wrong with that ? What if they speak out , think differently ? What kind of lives do they have then ? They go for treatment . What treatment ? I don 't ask . So , that 's what 's wrong with your cozy , little village life , 313 , and you know it . The old man , 554 , hell , she was killed right here . They had dreams , they knew the truth . No-no-no ! Look , I can 't ... Well , there 's gotta be others , and I 'm gonna find them . Yeah , I have to stop seeing you , Six . The people who get close to you , they don 't tend to live very long . Question : why does he go swimming after work ? Answer : because he likes swimming . We 're looking at a man who doesn 't wanna go home . And that makes him suspicious ? He knows he 's being watched . Everything is suspicious , if you look at it properly . Everyone has secrets . No one is without guilt . You just have to work out what it is they 're guilty of . Why don 't you arrest him and ask him if he 's a dreamer ? Well , that would produce nothing , but confusion . He would lie . If I catch him out in his lying , then he tells new lies , and then more new lies . It 's better to watch him . Wait ' til his guilt emerges . Who reported him ? One of his students . We don 't know which one . Reports come in anonymously for the safety and protection of the informant . That 's nice . Joggers . Good place to go lookin ' for dreamers . Usually one of the newcomers . Someone a bit too eager , pushing themselves too hard , right at the front . Runnin ' like they wanna get away from somethin ' . So , tell me the kind of work you 've been doin ' , so far . What do you got there , 66-16 ? My mother goes to yoga on Tuesdays . She hasn 't missed one in the last 23 weeks . Then , she missed one . That 's suspicious . Maybe it 's just she wasn 't feeling well . What do you have there , 1,100 ? My birthday presents . Long distance speech recording device . Uh-huh . And a mobile person tracker . Very nice . Sir , have you worked with the latest roach cam technology ? Uh , no , I have not . You drill a hole or plant it on a suspect , on their clothes or in their skin , So you can observe them 24 / 7 . Well , you certainly all have skills . You 're smart . So , here 's your new task . Find out who we 're working for . What do they want ? What are they up to ? What 's their secret ? That 'll be all tonight . Thank you . The towel is probably a coded signal . Maybe he 's just hanging it out to dry . A signal to who ? The others . What , like a group of them ? Organized ? They meet ? Did one of the suspects tell you this ? No one 's admitted it , yet . Once you 're a suspect , you 're guilty . Hello , you . Am I home ? Yeah . You 're in the village . Well , so I am . Good . How long have I been sleeping ? Too long for my liking . Hmm . Well , oh ... Feels like moments . Oh , dear . You having dreams a bit ? No-no-no . That 's what I was afraid of . Why this time ? Can a man not converse with his wife , Now and then ? I just needed to know that it was still possible . Are you hungry ? Like you wouldn 't believe . Wraps ? We haven 't much time . I know that . Mmm . Hmm ? You okay with heights ? There 's a flask of coffee in my trunk . Will you fetch it for me ? Tell me about him , our boy . How is he ? Our boy grew up . He 's curious about everything . Of course , he is . And ? Six . What is it ? Hmm . Drink up . Got any family , 909 ? Family ? No . I was never much good at relationships . I guess undercover 's don 't like to get too close to people . Something too human about that , huh ? Knock-knock , who 's there ? We have to get him to the hospital . No . Six ! Kinda makes you wonder , if he 'd do that to himself . Maybe he is guilty . You 're catching up fast . Is that how it works ? Is that how dreamers are caught ? That 's the way I was shown . You decide . I got it . Whoa . You must be an undercover , someone with a roach cam . We know so many undercover 's . It could be anyone . It could be you . Huh ? Six ! He 's different . He 's not like the other suspects . He has .. Yes , say it . Conviction . No harm must come to Six . He must survive . But he can suffer . His work as an undercover must make him feel compromised . Hmm ? Has Six ever met up with my son ? 11-12 ? Why would he be meeting with Six ? Youth is susceptible to wild ideas . Young blood craves rebellion as much as it craves sex . 11-12 spying on you ? No . No . No , of course not . Still , let 's keep an eye on him for his own protection . Thank you . Your father is watching you . He knows you go out at night . You lose your guards . Have I been followed ? He wants me to follow you . It 's good that it 's you . He suspects you might be meeting with Six . Why would he think that ? I don 't know . How 'd we get to this place ? It 's a good place still , isn 't it ? A safe place . Safe ? Hey , no one 's gonna touch you . It 's good . What ? This , I mean . You choosing me . I seem to recall it was you chose me . When I asked for your phone , you already knew I 'd been sent after you . It 's Summakor . Everyone has a monitor . Perk of the job . And you brought me here . Well , you 're free to go . But if you stay , we talk . You know I 'll stay . Let 's not waste any more time . I liked you , that wasn 't a lie . But if that was all , then I would 've had the courage to approach you . So , what did give you the courage ? Your reports . You asked questions . You were different . You said things that I was feeling about what was going on at Summakor . You must know more than you realize . They wanted you stopped . 19-55 , what happened to you , We have to stop this from happening to other dreamers . What ? I 'm a teacher . No , you 're not . I 'm the mistake . Please , I have a friend . She 's in danger . I need to get her out , get her to safety . Who are the dreamers , and how do I make contact ? Why did you do this to yourself ? We could 've found a way out . Why ? You 're two and a half minutes late , Six . I hear you 've been doing outstanding work . Everything and anything I might do is for one reason . That 's to work against you . I have a new mission for you . Shouldn 't we wait for 909 to get here ? Wasn 't invited . 909 's my new mission . 909 has made himself suspect . I have every faith in him as a conscientious undercover . I know he 's been spying on me . Well , of course , he has . But you 've known that before , surely . It 'd be a sorry state of affairs if he weren 't . Why has he become a suspect ? Well , something 's changed . 909 , he 's different . Don 't tell me you haven 't seen the fear in his eyes . Fear is not guilt . - Yes , it is . Fear is always guilt in disguise . I thought you were the man who understood human behavior . 909 's fear must be investigated , analyzed thoroughly . What is it I 'd be looking for ? Well , you 'll know when you find it . Perhaps he 's a dreamer . Why should I do it ? Because you need to keep up , Six . Give yourself a chance . He 's watching you . Now , you watch him . Do it Six , because you want to ... Because you must . 313 , you have to be careful . What do you mean ? I mean , whatever you dream , don 't draw anything , put anything on paper , or talk to anyone . Why are you doing this ? 'Cause I don 't want anything to happen to you . So , we found him . He was hurt . Where did you get these ? They were sent to me anonymously . That 's you ... That 's you on the roof of my building . It 's you ! Let me tell you why I did this . I know why . You 're the undercover . I let myself believe you . I can 't even bear to look at you . We should stop for a while . A few weeks , that 's all . I don 't think your father suspects us , but we should be careful . - My father suspects everyone . Yeah ... But not us ... Not if we 're careful . Come here . You sent those photographs to 313 . Why ? I-I didn 't send any photographs . 313 is not my mission . I want all surveillance taken off 313 . I want her left alone . I can 't give you that . But you can . I want 313 to be safe . That 's my price for keeping what I know to myself . Hello . I was sitting out in the garden a few days ago . I was being watched . - Watched ? Well , who would do such a thing ? 909 is different . Something 's happened to him . My long-serving lieutenant has secrets in these past weeks and months . We 're going to have to dig those secrets out of him , and then , we will know what we 're dealing with . * Then after all is said and done * * I 've seen I 'm not the lucky one * * But I 'm so disappointed baby in you * He knows . - It 's okay . Don 't be afraid . * You said you would be true * * But I found it just a boo * * For you 're doing just as others want you to * * Then after all of my love is keen * * It 's still blank to me it seems * * But I 'm so disappointed baby in you * * Play that thing 313 ! Where are you taking her ? Hey ! No . No ! - It 's done ! Don 't blame him . Tell me the dreams are true . They 're true ... They 're all true . There are dreamers ... They meet ... I 'm sure of it . Find them . 909 ? Don 't drink anymore . Please ? Tell me . Why did you resign ? To drink beer . Up on the purpose floor , something is wrong . That is why I came looking for you . I thought it bothered you . I thought you wanted to know . And now , you just want to drink beer . Maybe I don 't know what to think or who to trust . Maybe I 'm just trying to hold on to my own mind here . Maybe drinking beer is easier . You wanted to know . You stopped . Why ? Because you 're already there . What do you mean I 'm " already there ? " The people that you saw , the ones you said changed , the same thing has happened to you . I need you to help me . Where have they taken 313 ? What makes you think I would help you , Six ? Help me , or I go to your father with what you did to 909 . They went to the clinic . You 'll never find her . She 'll have been sent down to the tunnels . Tunnels ? What will they do to her ? You don 't wanna know . How do I get in ? Don 't . Only people going for treatment ever get in . Send me for treatment . This one is 909 . * I 've been in this town so long that back in the city * * I 've been taken for lost and gone * * And unknown for a long-long time * * Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl * * From the Spanish and Indian home * * Of the heroes and villains * Are you okay ? 1,100 ... we 've gotta get to 313 and find a way out of here . Come , this way . 313 ! 313 ! Shut up ! Shut up ! 313 ! 313 ! It 's okay , it 's me . There is a way out , come on ! * I 've been in this town so long * * So long to the city * * I 'm fit with the stuff and sunny down snuff * * I 'm all right * I had a thought . The mountains . We could walk ? Escape for a week ? Just us . Yeah , it sounds good . The man is dead . What ? Forget him . Someone your own age , hmm ? Could go to the other place ? Well , you 've got this ... the village . Oh , that 's enough , isn 't it ? Curtis , that 's the name that I hear whispered all the time . Curtis ! We have to go in there now . I-I- - No .. I 'm trying to help you here . I 'm not going back there . Why-why should I trust you ? Because .. - Get out ! We don 't have time for this . - Get out of my apartment ! You know , if you , um , change your mind , you can call me , okay ? I will allow Six to be in the tunnels for a while longer . Thank you . You did extremely well . You wouldn 't go against your parents like my son disobeyed me , would you , 1,100 ? No , sir . Now , was this you ? No , don 't-don 't turn away . This hole is exactly at your head height . It could 've been one of the other kids . But it was you , wasn 't it ? We 're going to have to send you for treatment , aren 't we ? It 's all right , you can finish your ice cream first .

 Torchwood . 'Outside the Government , beyond the police . 'Fighting for the future on behalf ofthe human race . 'The 21st century is when everything changes ... 'And Torchwood is ready . ' Nothing so far . You getting anything on that ? Well , hold on a tick . Yes , follow me , Gerald . Well ? We 're pretty close . This way . Don 't panic . I thought you were a ghost . Scared the wits out of me ! Sorry . Thought you 'd be used to us creeping around by now . Have you seen any recently ? Ghosts . I 've seen three today . It 's getting worse . Well , you 're a very brave girl . Thank you , sir . Where did you see them ? In the ward . St Teilo 's Militry Hospital Mind , half of this lot see things anyway . Nerves shot to pieces . Poor chaps . Soon as they 're better , they 'll be sent back to the Front . Field Marshal Haig 's order . 'Every position must be held to the last man . 'Each one of us must fight on to the end . ' Whenever that is . Gerald . Come on . We 're right on top of it ! Hello ? Tell them . Tell us what ? Tell them what to do . You 're the only one who can stop this . If you don 't , it 's the end of everything ! Tommy ! Take me . I 'm in there in the ward , in 1918 . You have to take me so I can be here now . just take me ! - Tommy , you 'd better come with us . - Why ? Don 't worry . I 'm Gerald and this is Harriet . We 'll look after you . Who are you ? We 're Torchwood . Who is he ? Thomas Reginald Brockless . Tommy . 24 years-old . Sort of . Well , he 's either 24 or he 's not . Depends how you work it out . All right , when was he born ? Owen , you ready ? Yeah , nearly . Is that a dress , Tosh ? I do believe it is , Owen . Well , where is he ? He 's been here for 90 years , longer than any of us . Any of you . Torchwood have used alien cryogenics since Victorian times . They froze Tommy in 1918 . So he 's 24 or 114 years old . I know which one I 'd choose . We have to wake him up every 12 months or so . Well , defrost him . One day only , then back in the freezer . Why ? Check he still works . One day , we 're gonna need him . Right , everybody ready ? Come on , Tommy . Charging 200 , clear ! Charging 360 . Clear ! Gwen , quick . It 's all right ! Get off me , leave me alone . - Tommy ! - Leave me alone ! Tommy ! Tommy , listen to me ! Tommy Brockless ! It 's me , Toshiko . Toshiko . Remember ? Gets harder every year . Good left hook , though . Do you know where you are ? Torchwood . That 's right . Is it time again ? Blimey . How are you feeling ? HE COUGHS I could murder a cup of tea . Don 't expect the best china . I 'm starving . Here , tuck in . There 's enough to feed an army . Nice dress . Thank you . Got your slacks on underneath . Is it that cold ? It 's the fashion this year . 1968 , they were in miniskirts . Thought all my Christmases had come at once . Shame they haven 't made a comeback . I still don 't get it . Why is he here ? Like I said - one day , we 're gonna need him . And pull to me . Good . Seems fine . - Ijust need to take a few blood samples . - Blood samples . We wake you up once a year and stick needles into you , it 's not fair . Once a year for you , it 's every day for me . So , while we wait . Tommy Reginald Brockless , born 1894 February the 7th in Blackley , Manchester . Private officer in 10th West Yorkshire regiment . Very good . Only son of Constance May Bassett , died 1900 , and Thomas Campbell Brockless , died june 1931 , aged 57 . Heart attack . That 's right , isn 't it ? Yes . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . Ijust haven 't had that much time to get used to it . Right , I need to have a look at this leg . St Teilo 's Hospital , 1918 . There was a time-shift . A fracture in the rift means that two slices of time were erupting into each other . A slice of 1918 , and ? A slice ofthe future . But we don 't know exactly what slice . It could be tomorrow , it could be in 100 years ' time . What will happen ? Chunks of 1918 will start to appear at the hospital . A few at first , then more and more . When the time-shift is complete , it 'll start a chain reaction . Unless we stop it , time-shifts 'll start happening all over the country , then all over the world . But how does Tommy fit in ? He helps to stop it somehow . Torchwood 1918 left us sealed orders . 'Eyes-only documents . 'FAO Torchwood commander overseeing case 1918 / T B. Tommy Brockless ? It 's stuck . - No , it 's locked . - OK , where 's the key ? temporal lock tied in with the rift frequencies at the hospital . * * * the box will open and we 'll find out exactly what Tommy does . But why would they keep us in the dark , jack ? I guess we 'll find that out , too . Seriously , what do you think ? You look like a film star . Who , Charlie Chaplin ? Come on . Have you got any more of those pretty boys in the freezer ? Hands off , missy . Tosh got there first . Thanks for holding the fort while I 'm out . No worries , have fun . Be careful . Where are you off ? Drink , film , maybe a pizza . Oh , very nice . I 'll be on the mobile if you need me . - Have a lovely time . - Bye ! He 's a frozen soldier from 1918 . Nobody 's perfect . Slow down , what 's the hurry ? I 've only got one day , I want to see everything . Captain Scott ... sailed from here , when he went off to the Antarctic . 1910 . I was 16 , papers were full of it . Took him two years to get there and then he snuffed it . So , what 've you been up to since I last saw you ? This and that . Work , mostly . What ? I knew you were going to say that . It 's what you always say . So how 's the piano playing going ? That 's what you said last year . 'I 'm gonna learn the piano . ' Never got round to it . I bet you never learnt Spanish , neither . I bought a book , though ! Oh , are you made of money ? I haven 't had time . You talk about your life like you 've got no control over it . Well , Torchwood 's pretty much 24 / 7 . 24 hours a day , 7 days a week . But you weren 't conscripted . I mean , it 's your choice , right ? Yeah ... I suppose it is . He 's a bit of all right . He 's the boss . Nothing changes . She 's all right , too . Harriet Derbyshire . Wonder what happened to her . She died the year after that was taken . 26 years old . So young . They all were . Nothing changes . Where are you going ? St Teilo 's Hospital . And bloody cheer up , will you ? Good shot ! You 're still winning . It 's alljust maths , really . Angles , velocity ... Give you women a vote , equal rights , look what happens , eh ? So , er , you got a boyfriend yet ? You sound like my mother . Ah , so you haven 't , then . You had a girlfriend ? In 1918 . Yeah . Ellie . We courted for two years . What happened ? I , er , stopped seeing her ... last time I was home on leave . The war changed me . I couldn 'tjust carry on like before . I 'm sorry . Right pair we make . Hello ? I said hello . Can you hear me ? Look , can you hear me ? If you just ... Hello ? Are you all right , love ? You look as if you 've seen a ghost . They 're knocking down the hospital ? Yeah , that 's what they said . Could that have triggered the time-shift ? Could have . Maybe all the psychic trauma and rift energy charged it up like a battery . 1918 , this place was full of wounded soldiers . They had four years of it . Passchendaele , the Somme . A million British soldiers killed during the Great War . It was like walking into hell . Believe me . I was there . Owen ? You got anything ? All quiet here . just that little spike from earlier . This is more Tosh 's thing than mine . Shalll give her a call ? Not yet . just keep watching . Yes , mate . Half a bitter , and a vodka and diet tonic with a slice of lemon , please . * * * Seems like there 's always a war somewhere . That 's not exactly a war . Looks like one . First year they woke me up ... 1919 ... they told me it was all over . We won . 'The war to end all wars , ' they said . And then three weeks later , you had the Second World War . After all that . Do you never wonder if we 're worth saving ? The human race . Yes . I think we 're worth saving . Wars and all . What ? What ? I wasjust thinking ... I 'd do anything for you . Yeah , all you have to do is say , ' Tommy , you 're my brave , handsome hero , and I need you . ' Is that all ? And whatever it is , I 'll do it . I mean it . Anything . What is it ? I dunno . I just felt something ... Jack ? jack . # Tick-tock , wind up the clock # # I like them all ... # I bet you say that to all the girls . # Show me a skirt , and my brain simply whirls ... # Matron won 't have singing . You 'll get a good telling off if she hears you . # I love their dimples and curls # # Tick-tock , wind up the clock # # And I start my day over again # # Tick-tock , wind up the clock # # And I start my day over again ... # jack , you see anything ? 'Cos I 've got a little mountain range this end . ' Yeah , we 've got a few ghosts here . 'Gwen , you OK ? 'Gwen ? ' I 'm fine . They 're ready for you now . Hello ? Hello ? I see you . Why won 't you leave us alone ? You shouldn 't be here ! I don 't mean you any harm . You shouldn 't be here ! I don 't mean you any harm . I 'm going to get you ! Stop , stop , no . - Please , no , Tommy , no . Stop ! - I 'm putting you down . I 'm putting you down . What ? Nothing . Thanks . Thanks ? Itjust caught me out . - It doesn 't matter . - What ? I know it 's silly ... but I 'm a bit older than you . I was born in 1894 . You know what I mean . So I 'm old enough to die for my country but I 'm too young to give you a kiss ? You daft lass . What goes on in that head of yours ? Thanks . You 're welcome . I might be young , but I 've seen a fair bit in my time . So what do you want to do now ? Well , we could go back to mine but there 's only room for one and it 's bloody freezing . You want to come back to my place ? I 'm hardly rushing you . You 've known me four years . Four days ... OK . Let 's go . I 'll race you , come on ! jack . Toshiko ! We 're on our way . Demolishing the hospital is what triggers the time-shift . So , don 't demolish it . Too late , it 's already started . What happens next ? Two different times should never exist simultaneously . You want to be in 1918 , or now . Not both . So when 1918 becomes fully manifest ... It 's really going to screw us up . OK . Linear time . Screwed up time . Imagine your life as a straight line , from birth to death . Try drawing that line on the paper without straightening it out . It 's impossible . That 's why we 've got to stop it . Ianto , is that box doing anything yet ? Still locked . We need to find out how fast the time-shift is happening . * * * * Tosh , Owen , go to the hospital , we need readings . Cover the place with rift monitors . Gwen , go through the files , see if there 's anything we missed . Need a hand ? just a couple more . Listen , Tosh , I 've been meaning to say ... just be careful . What do you mean ? You 're very close to Tommy . I 've only known him for four days . Yeah . You 've fallen for him , haven 't you ? I can be myself with him . I don 't have to pretend . No , I understand . I didn 't think you had some weird fetish for defrosted men . Ijust , um ... I don 't want you to get hurt , that 's all ... if you have to say goodbye . 'Owen , can you hear me ? ' What is it ? 'I need you to go down into the east wing of the hospital , ' head for the second floor , what used to be the radiology section . 'I think that area contains a clue to the time-shift . 'I read this earlier , but it didn 't make any sense . ' In the Torchwood 1918 field report at the hospital , they describe a certain detail of their encounter . It reads ... 'Through a hole in the external wall , we hear the roar of great engines . 'Outside is a woman in strange armour , ripping a Union jack , 'perhaps some future heroine ofthe Empire . ' What does it mean ? 'It doesn 't sound like us , now . ' The time-shift has started , but maybe it doesn 't complete until years in the future . Got it ! It 's some kind of advert ... for car insurance . 'That sound they heard must have been traffic . ' It 's not years in the future ... it 's now . Instructions ? Yeah , for Tommy . And Toshiko . In 12 hours , there 'll be a brief moment when both times exist before the time-shift completes , when Tommy can be here now , and in 1918 . He needs to be in the hospital , ready to step from one time to another . So he 'd be right inside the time-shift ? And he can close the fracture that caused it . And when the fracture 's closed ? 1918'll be back where it belongs . So will I. For good ? Yeah . You 're the only one who can do this . We brought you from 1918 to now , and when you go back to 1918 , your life will be like a thread , stitching time back together again . A stitch in time . How ? This is a rift manipulator . It 's basically a key . Once you 're inside the time-shift , you can close the door behind you . And that 's it ? I 'm gone ? Tommy , stay with Ianto . Tosh ? With me . What happens to him ? Three weeks after we send Tommy back , he dies . How ? He 's shot by a firing squad . I don 't understand . In 1918 , Tommy was suffering from shell shock . That 's why he was in the hospital . When Torchwood took him and froze him , they froze his most recent memories . When he returns to 1918 , he 'll revert back to who he was . He 'll be shell-shocked and so he 'll be executed by the British Army for cowardice . They can 't shoot him for that . Lots of soldiers who were shell-shocked recovered enough to be sent back to the Front . But once they were there ... they broke down again . So they kill him ? More than 300 of them . Then we can 't send him back . - We have to . - I can 't do that . Yes , you can . He trusts you . To send him to his death ? To help him save the future . It has to be you . We 've kept these in the archives . You were wearing them in the hospital when Torchwood took you . Good job the moths haven 't got into them . So I 'll be saving the world in some pyjamas ? How daft is that ? Torchwood 1918 saw you with Tommy in the hospital , telling him what to do . I know you . You 're strong enough to do this . Does Tommy know what happens to him ? No . If he asks me , what do I say ? Where 's Toshiko ? Still in with jack . so TOITIOITOW | T | 0 | ' | ' li | ' IQ . What time is it now ? Ten to nine . So what do we do till then ? You don 't know , do you ? What would you like to do ? The night before we went over the top , we used to play cards , write letters , have a drink , if anyone had some . Well , we could do that . Yeah . But you 're not coming with me . I 'm going on my own . We were just wondering what Tommy should do tonight . He can come home with me . He 's not our prisoner , he doesn 't have to stay here . Does he ? No . If that 's what you both want . Tomorrow morning , 6.30 . Come in . You 're very neat . Yes . Well , there 's only me here . And me . just for tonight . Then I 'll be gone . I never thought it would really happen . I won 't even be able to write to you . You 're going to be so far away . I worried you 'd see me getting older . This time tomorrow , he 'll be back in 1918 . In his own time . Would you go back to yours ? If you could ? Why , would you miss me ? Yep . I left home a long time ago . I don 't really know where I really belong . Maybe that doesn 't matter any more . I know you get lonely . Going home wouldn 't fix that . Being here , I 've seen things I never dreamt I 'd see . Loved people I never would have known if I 'd just stayed where I was . And I wouldn 't change that for the world . What did he tell you ? What happens to me ? They send you back to France . Then what ? Do they find my body ? That 's something . It 's time . You know we can 't be here when it happens . Come on . We 're safe for now . Are you all right ? Tommy ! Where is she ? In1918 ? 'Tommy , Ithink you 'd better come with us . 'Don 't worry . I 'm Gerald , this is Harriet . 'We 'll look after y0u . ' Torchwood took me . 'Tommy ! ' Tommy ! Stay here . I won 't do it . I can 't go back . - You 've got to . - No ! I know what 'll happen . They 'll send me back to the Front , I 'll be back in the trenches . Help me . You 've got to go . Why me ? You 're no better than the generals . Sitting safely behind the lines , sending us over the top . Any one of you could go , but you 're sending me . We belong here . I 'm sorry . I 've been shoved from pillar to post all my life by the Army , by Torchwood . All this time I 've had , it means nothing . - Tommy . - Get off . - Tommy , get up . - No ! Leave us alone . Please . You 've got two minutes . Listen , you 're a hero . Do you know that ? Because you stop the time-shift and save everyone . You save us all . I can 't do it . We need you . I don 't want to be a hero . I want to stay here with you . Hello ? Tell them . Tell us what ? Tell them what to do . You 're the only one who can stop this . If you don 't , if you don 't , it 's the end of everything . Tommy ! Take me . I 'm in there in the ward in 1918 . You have to take me so I can be here now . just take me ! I 'll be gone soon . Remember ... the rift key . Use it . You 've got to get back into bed . Like y0u 've never been away . Then use the key . Tommy ? Remember . It 's nearly time . What are you doing ? You shouldn 't be in here . Go , go ! Come on ! - Tommy , Ithink you 'd better come with us . - Why ? Don 't worry . I 'm Gerald , this is Harriet . We 'll look after you . Who are you ? We 're Torchwood . Where are we going ? Somewhere safe . Trust me . Keep going . Don 't look back . You should be in bed . Still warm , at least . Not been gone long . What 's happening ? I don 't know . The time-shift hasn 't stopped . Toshiko , show me the city , now ! It 's spreading out from the hospital . What the hell are they ? - the past , erupting into the present . They 're everywhere . What about the rift key ? Tommy isn 't using it . Why not ? I don 't know . Because he 'sjust gone back to 90 years ago , because he 's shell-shocked ? One of us will have to go back . jack , wait ! You 'll get stuck in 1918 . I 've got an idea . The time-shift 's forcing the rift open . We can use it to our advantage . A tiny amount should do . We know Tommy 's exact location in time . If we send an image of you through to him ... I can go into Tommy 's mind . As a psychic projection , if we 're lucky . And Tommy will be able to see you . I can make him use the key . Let me do it . He trusts me . OK . How long have I got ? Minutes . You 've got one shot , Tosh . That 's all . All right ? Tommy . Tommy . Tommy . She 's found him . It 's me . Toshiko . Who ? I 'm hereto help you . Is this yours ? No . Do you know what it is ? Tommy , it 's a key . You have to use it . I 'm scared . It 's all right . That 's why I 'm here . I 'm a coward . No , you are not . What am I fighting for ? For the future , for me . Because you 're my brave , handsome hero . Tommy , use the key . Thank you . Goodbye . It 's all right . He did it . Thank you . He trusted me right to the end . Because you were strong . All of this . is still here because of you . Because of Tommy . Let 's hope we 're worth it .

 CLAIRE : Previously on Heroes . What happened to your parents ? I touched them and they died . MR. BENNET : I know about your power . And I know that you 're not a killer . You 're a healer . You 're staying here ? How long ? Until I know that you 're all right . I 'm Becky Taylor . Open rush starts today at the house , why don 't you come by and meet the girls ? I 'm missing bid night , Uncle Samuel . Checking on your work with Claire Bennet . You 're doing everything you can to isolate hen push other people away , push her in our direction ? I remember flying . I flew jets . In the military , maybe . What 's the first name that pops into your head ? Call me Nathan . I have a crush . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Please accept this bid to join the Psi Alpha Chi sisterhood . You need to figure out how to undo what you did , give me back my body , and I will be happy . You 're a killer . I 'm a cop . If I have to keep you trapped inside this prison for the rest of my life , so be it . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( BOTH PANTING ) ( LAUGHS ) ( JANICE MOANING ) ( CONTINUES MOANING ) That was amazing . You were amazing . Forbidden fruit . My favorite kind . Sheriff , you can 't do this . Is that right ? Well , now , you say you 're a family friend , and now you 're a lawyer ? Jeremy lost his parents . Well , my point exactly . You saw the broken heater in that house . You can 't lock him up like he 's some kind of a killer . You know this was an accident . Yeah . What I know is that two people are dead , and that boy ... Well , let 's just say that it 's not the first time he 's made some trouble in my town . Okay ? He 's building up quite the rap sheet . Are you pressing charges ? That kid ain 't going anywhere until I finish my investigation . And if and when that happens , I 'm not releasing him to anyone who 's not the next of kin . And that is not you , friend . You have yourself a nice evening now . ( DOOR CLOSING ) ( PHONE BEEPS ) Hey . It 's me . I need your help . ( LAUGHS ) I can get a latte here , no problem , right ? I saw a cow about a mile back . You get some espresso , we 're in business . Thanks for coming . I didn 't know if you 'd show . And who was your fallback ? Don 't have one . Then I 'm honored . So , you found a kid with abilities . I thought that you were done with the whole bag and tag business . This is more of a rescue mission . His name is Jeremy , 17 years old . He has what you 'd call a dual ability . Life and death . He got into an argument with his parents and ... He killed them ? It was an accident . His emotions got the better of him . We all know that that can happen . Is that why you called me ? Not entirely . Look , they won 't release him to me because I 'm not family . But it turns out that the kid is very fond of his Aunt Tracy . Just go in , talk to him , sign him out . I don 't know . He 's got nobody . ( SIGHS ) You 've been there . Are you awake ? Yeah . You ? CLAIRE : Yep . Are you afraid I 'm going to kiss-attack you in your sleep ? Maybe . We should talk about this . Yeah , I guess we should . ( EXHALES ) ( SIGHS ) It was stupid and impulsive and bad ... It wasn 't bad . I mean , you 're a good kisser , I just ... I don 't want to mess this up . Mess what up ? My new , totally ordinary life . You know , the one I 'm still chasing . Gretch , you 're the first real friend I 've had since I left Texas , and that 's a big deal for me . And I really like you a lot . Just not in that way . ( GRUNTS ) Jeez , Claire . You don 't have to go all Buffy on us . We 're just kidnapping you . ( PANTING ) I am so sorry . Do you wanna be an Alpha Chi or not ? Is that a trick question ? Where are you taking us ? Well , if I told you , that wouldn 't be a very good kidnapping , would it ? CLAIRE : I cannot believe that they shoved us in a trunk . So lame . Look at us . All tied up in the dark . You know , they have entire websites devoted to this . Sorry . Sorry . ( SIGHS ) So , you were saying how you didn 't really like me in that way . No , you were saying that . I was saying that you 've been a great friend . So , which way is it ? I don 't know . What does that mean ? It means I don 't know . ( CAR STOPS ) Awesome . Good morning . Welcome to Hell Week . All right , ladies , listen up . This is what we call a Screamin ' Scavenger Hunt . There 's a big Alpha Chi treasure close by . Whichever team finds it first gets to sit out Hell Week . Trust me , you wanna sit out . We bought goldfish . ( SORORITY GIRLS LAUGH ) Good luck . But remember , ladies , someone 's gotta win and someone 's gotta lose . ( SORORITY GIRLS SCREAM ) ( DOOR SLAMS ) ASHLEY : Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Where are we ? Thank you . Jeremy . My name 's Tracy . I 'm a friend of Mr. Bennet 's . How 'd you get in here ? TRACY : We told them that I was your aunt . My aunt ? I don 't have an aunt . You do now . Mr. Bennet fixed some paperwork , and here I am . Mr. Bennet said that everything would go away , that the cops would buy the story . Mr. Bennet said they 'd let me go . Hey . All I have to do is sign you out . That might not be such a good idea . Why not ? I killed my parents . I 'm a murderer . You can 't control me . You 've never been able to do that . Well , I had a compelling reason . Let 's face it . Your wife is kind of hot . ( SHOUTS ) Enough . That 's the second Parkman I made scream today . ( LAUGHS ) If you want , I can give you some pointers later . You crazy psycho . What are you gonna do ? Hit me ? Defend your lady 's honor ? We both know it 's not about that . It 's about all those other things I can do to her and Matty . The next time I take over your body , that 's when the real fun begins . ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) Hmm . Cozy . Oh , my God . Do you smell that ? It smells like something died in here . OLIVIA : What is this place ? Oh , my God . Slaughterhouse . Oh , my ... Please don 't say that again . Hey , guys . Super-cute puzzle over here . GRETCHEN ; " What you find will help you survive . " When we were found will keep you alive . " " When we were found " ? Okay , guys. let 's just open one so we can get out of here . CLAIRE : Wait . ( SCREAMING ) Relax . Relax . It 's not real . They 're just trying to scare us . ( ASHLEY SIGHS ) Open 24 . How do you know ? " When we were found . " 1924 . That 's when the sorority was founded . You know that ? My mom 's a former sister , remember ? ( SIGHS ) Oh . ( CLAIRE LAUGHS ) Yay ! Thank God . I am so thirsty . Hey . One bottle per team . No problem . Come on , Ash . They won the first round . Now we are going to bring it . ( WHINES ) Can I just stay here ? Jeremy , what happened with your parents , I understand . All you did was touch them . The day that I discovered my ability , I killed a man . He was threatening me . I grabbed him , and something took over , something inside of me . And no matter how hard I tried ... You couldn 't let go . Your emotions took over . You got mad . For most people , that 's not a bad thing . We 're not most people . ( CRIES ) I 'm gonna get you out of here . His next of kin is here . What possible reason do you have for holding him ? Well , we got plenty . Is this Jeremy 's ? Gil , show him what we found . " I feel the darkness surrounding me . I am the bringer of death . " He 's 17 years old . Half the songs on his iPod sound just like that . Well , maybe I should read you the part about killing animals . Any kid at school will tell you he does it . For fun . So now we 're taking gossip as evidence ? Is that it ? There 's something wrong with that boy , okay ? As far as I 'm concerned , this proves it . He ain 't getting away with killing his family . He 's staying right here . TRACY : No . They still haven 't charged him and their evidence is circumstantial at best . Yes , right now . I 'm calling in a favor , Dennis . Thank you . All right , I 'll see you then . Sounds like you 're shaking things up in there . From the looks of the place , I 'd say they could use it . Is that right ? Tell me something . How 's a girl like you end up in a place like this ? ( LAUGHS ) You 'd have to do better than that . The name is Samuel . And I 'm hereto ask you one question . If you 're here to save young Jeremy 's life , then what 's next ? Are you gonna take him to a place just to live ? ( CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Or where he belongs ? What did you do ? It 's all right . Stay back . I 'm a friend , Tracy . How do you know my name ? Lt 's all right . You 're safe here . I 'm like you . We 're all like you . What is this place ? Home . Slaughter floor or operations center ? CLAIRE : Should I even ask ? Have a nice Hell Week . After you . CLAIRE : Ugh . So , how long have you known ? Known what ? That I really don 't wanna be in this sorority ? That you liked girls . ( LAUGHS ) You make it sound like I have to declare . Like it 's my major or something . I 'm actually jealous . First year of college and you 've already figured yourself out . I don 't know about that . Truth is , I 've had more boyfriends than girlfriends . Really ? Mmm-hmm . How many more ? Six or seven . It 's not a lot , right ? Sounds about right . But you 're not ... No , you couldn 't be . You were a cheerleader . Not what ? A virgin . ( LAUGHS ) ( LAUGHS ) Wow . We could not be more different . Maybe we 're strange attractors . Strange attractors ? It 's a physics thing . Everything in the universe has a magnetic charge , right ? So strange attractors are particles that end up together that don 't really belong together , but when they 're together , they 're super powerful . Sort of like we could be . Or not . What ? Hold on . Come on . Don 't tell me you 're freaked out now . I mean , look . See ? Nothing . Just more lameness . Gretch . What the hell was that ? ( GRUNTS ) I 'm starting to think this isn 't a game . This is the life Jeremy could have . What ? Working at a carnival ? Surrounded by family . His true family . Do you remember the first time you experienced your gift ? " Gift " might be a little generous . Like the entire universe coursing through you , all at once . That wasn 't just your ability , Tracy . You were tapping into something greater than yourself . SAMUEL : We 're all connected . TRACY : I 'd like to believe that . Believe it . Every time someone joins this family , I get a feeling , in here . It 's an energy , I guess . It gets stronger every day . This is where Jeremy should be . What , living in trailers ? Drifting from town to town ? What would you do ? Give him a false name ? A false life ? This is a boy who can work miracles . Why should he be invisible ? Bring him home . You could join him . I know you 've been lost , too . It 's your nature . That 's enough . Just take me back now . Fair enough . Look , I 'm never about the hard sell , but please take this . To find your way back here . This is Lydia . She 'll take you from here . I know her . I helped her . She came to me when she was sad . No . I held her in my arms . We were flying . We 've talked about this . The memories you 're having , they 're not yours . Then whose are they ? And if the real me isn 't in here , then where am I ? Matt , what are you doing ? Uh ... I have to leave . It 's just ... It 's not safe for you and Matty . Why ? Because ... ( SIGHS ) Someone else can control me . My body . Someone else . Matt , why do you always do this ? Come on . We 're just getting close . We 're going on 15 years and you want to blow everything up again ? Janice . Janice . Look , I did a terrible thing . This should be good . I used my ability to push one man 's memories into another man 's head . Yeah , my head . There is somebody out there using my body without my permission . I didn 't even know that you could do that . It was wrong . I know that . But I had to do it to get rid of this really bad criminal . Well , that 's not very nice . So quick to label . Or at Ieast just his mind . And now his consciousness is rattling around up in here . Well , there 's so much space . Will you shut up ? Janice , Janice . Look , I can get rid of him . The answer 's out there . I just gotta go find it . Good luck . I need you to trust me . Okay ? And I 'm gonna give you guys a moment . You trust me , right ? Do your thing . Come on , you said it yourself , a decade and a half , that 's worth something , right ? I can fix this . Okay . Okay . You need a place to work things out , you should stay here . No . No , I insist . It 's safer for you here . And I 'll take Matty and we 'll go and ... ( SHOUTS ) Don 't . Don 't tell me where you 're gonna go . I don 't want him to hear . Okay . Okay . ( PANTS ) I love you . ( SIGHS ) Good . ( DOOR OPENS ) SYLAR : ( SIGHS ) That was pretty smart , even for you , not letting her tell me where she 's gonna be . But you still haven 't figured out how to get rid of me , genius . ( LAUGHS ) Mohinder , look , I have no idea where you are . Just ... Will you do me a favor ? Call me back . Okay ? I just ... When you get this , just call me . ( LAUGHS ) Mohinder ? How 's he gonna help you ? ( MIMICS MOHINDER ) He 's probably still working on his father 's research . Why don 't you try your old lady ? See if she picks up . ( LAUGHS ) Forget it , Parkman . It is time for you to give me back my body and just accept that I 'm gaining ground and I ... ( SYLAR GRUNTS ) I can make you do whatever I want . Yeah ? This is hurting you a little bit , isn 't it ? ( LAUGHS ) You wish . You know what ? You 're right . I mean , you slept with my wife . You can control me at any time , right ? All right . Control me . Stop me from drinking this beer . Come on . Come on . Stop me . ( GRUNTS ) ( LAUGHS ) Why don 't we see how you do against the heavy artillery . ( GROANS ) Wait . I think I finally found a leash for this dog . There you are . Your guy came through . I 've made all the arrangements . That 's great . You all right ? Yeah . Yeah . Let 's just ... Let 's get him out of here . Hey . Jeremy , they 're letting you go . But who am I gonna live with ? MR. BENNET : You 'll be a few doors down from me in my apartment building in D.C. I 've setup a new identity for you . Your name is Jarod Mitchell , and you 're going to attend Georgetown High School . So nobody will know what I can do ? You 'll learn to control your ability with Tracy 's help . But you 're gonna keep it to yourself . It 's the only way . What if something happens ? Nothing 's going to happen . You 'll be safe . You 'll be invisible . GRETCHEN : So , what , you think a sorority brought us out hereto kill us ? That 's ridiculous . It 's just a game . CLAIRE : It didn 't just move itself . But there was no one else there . How else would you explain it ? In my world , there 's a million ways . Name one . Telekinesis . I 've seen it . Heck , I know someone who has it . So , wait , you 're saying there 's another one of you here ? CLAIRE : It 's very possible . And , what , they 're bored and they 're playing a college prank on you ? Not a prank . You think that they 're trying to kill you ? Not me . Then who ? Me ? Come on . Think about it . My first roommate committed suicide with a mysterious note that wasn 't there , but then it was . I mean , maybe you almost getting gutted wasn 't a coincidence . Claire , that is a little out there . Sounds like some crazy-ass conspiracy theory . Which pretty much describes your entire life . What was that ? I don 't know . ( ASHLEY PANTING ) ( SCREAMING ) Ash , cut it out . Come on . Hey , you guys all right ? You find another clue ? Like I 'm gonna tell you . Look , your roommate 's freaked out , and we don 't care about the treasure . Let 's just stick together , get the hell out of here , and once we find it , you can have it . Deal ? Okay . Can we just go ? Deal . Lead the way . ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) MR. BENNET : Take my car . Straight ahead . WOMAN : You 're sick ! MAN : We know what happened to your parents ! Hey , you 're getting away with murder , you ... Let go of him . Hey . TRACY : Don 't hurt him . MR. BENNET : Jeremy , stop . Let him go . ( MAN GROANS ) Get the hell away from him . Jeremy . Jeremy . Jeremy , you can save him . Get the hell away from him . Everyone , back . Back . Jeremy , listen to me . You can help him . You can save him . Everybody , stand back . ( ECHOING ) Now , listen , son . You 're going back in there , where you belong . You know what you did to your momma and your daddy . Jeremy , come on . You can save him . You can do it . Jeremy . You do not understand the first thing about what 's happening here . Three people are dead . I understand that . And that boy , whatever he is , is responsible . Hey , do you want it to happen again ? Just let me talk to him . Talk to him ? You 're through talking to him . Both of you . You think killers go free , huh ? Not in this town . Gil , where 's the boy ? Gil , do you read ? The boy is gone . Gil , do you read me ? Are you there ? Not so tough now , are you ? Go ahead . Take your best shot . Give me a reason . ( GROANS ) ( SOBS ) You 're not normal . ( LAUGHS ) You don 't belong here . Go . ( MATT GROANS ) You like that ? You know what this is ? I bought this with Janice on our anniversary trip to Ensenada . And it is so poetic that I 'm using it to bury you . Bury me or drown the truth ? The truth ? What ? That you 're nothing . You 're just a figment of my imagination . ( GROANS ) Let 's quiet those voices , shall we ? Your wife walked out on you . You think she wanted to give you your space ? She can 't stand the sight of you . You 're pathetic . You know what she said to me in front of the fire last night ? " Why can 't you be more like this all the time ? " When you 're gone , Janice and I are gonna have a beautiful life together . ( CONTINUES GROANING ) You 're so desperate to fit in . Why can 't you accept your power ? Why do you insist on being so forgettable ? Oh , man . You 're afraid . You 're afraid of dying . And you just passed out . ( LAUGHS ) You just passed out . ( SHOUTS ) Yes . ( MATT GROANS ) Matt . Parkman . Honey , I did it . I really did it . Parkman ? Okay , okay . " Kill house . " " Prep room . " Kill house sounds more dangerous . We 're taking that one . I thought we were gonna stick together ? ( LAUGHS ) No way . Let 's just check this real quick , and we 'll catch up to them . Well , we won . GRETCHEN : Kind of . I 'm gonna go get Paris and Nicole . ( LAUGHS ) I get it , by the way . You get what ? You , wanting to run from your freaky world and live a normal life . I shouldn 't have put you on the spot and gotten all relationshippy on you . The last thing you need right now ... I need you . Trust me . What ? Gretchen . ( COUGHS ) ( THUDS ) ( CHOKING ) ( THUDS ) ( COUGHING ) ( GASPING ) GRETCHEN : What 's going on ? Oh , my God . Claire . ( THUDS ) ( GASPS ) Oh , my ... God . Becky ? Grab her . ( WHIMPERS ) A little help , please . Claire ? Oh , my God . Claire . Oh , my God . Don 't . Don 't do it . Stop ! Stop ! OLIVIA : Don 't ! Don 't ... What the ... ASHLEY : What ? OLIVIA : How did you ... What 's happening ? What are we going to do ? TRACY : Noah . ( CRIES ) We could have saved him . He needed a home . A real home . Tracy . Hey . Tracy , I 'm sorry . You know , this was supposed to be simple . Just go in and sign him out . I thought I could manage it . By hiding him away for the rest of his life ? I stood on his porch and I told him that I wouldn 't let him down . But you did . We did . I did what I thought was right . And I was wrong . I 've been wrong all these years . Do we have to be invisible ? You ever think we could just live , Noah ? Out in the open ? After today , no . Don 't ever call me again . ( SNIFFS ) ( GRUNTS ) Hi . Hey . You gave us quite a scare there , brother . I know . I 'm sorry . I just ... I had to see if I could ... I 'm much better now . Not quite . We start over . From the beginning . You hear me ? Yeah . Thanks . Both of you . I love you . ( LAUGHS ) You 'll love me a lot more after I take a shower . ( SIGHS ) Let me guess . You want your body back . Did you think you were actually winning ? The second you blacked out , I slipped right in . Now I 'm in the driver 's seat . You 'll never get away with this . I already have . ( LAUGHS ) ( RUMBLING )

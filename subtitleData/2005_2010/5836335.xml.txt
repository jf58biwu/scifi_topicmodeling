 You haven 't worked in a week . Yep . " Yep " ? That 's all you have to say ? Hadley , I 'm getting worried . The bills are piling up . I realize that , Beatrice . Well , when are you gonna do something about it ? Everything will work out . Good things will come of this . How ? You have spent all of our savings on that ... thing upstairs . It is not a thing . It is an antique that takes a lot of time and patience to restore . No . You 're obsessed . What about us ? What about family ? When does that not take precedence ? I have to finish building the machine . It needs to be done . There are a lot of things that need to be done around here . We have a daughter coming to visit . I guess you 'll never understand , Beatrice . I have to do this . How about this ? Why don 't you go get a goddamn job , and I 'll stay home all day watching TV ? How 's that ? That better ? That way , I could get a little fucking work done . I 'm sorry . I know . [ hammering ] [ hammering ] [ hammering ] Huh ? [ mumbles ] [ hammering ] [ voices whispering ] Uh , yes , I know . It 's been a long time . [ voices whispering ] What 's that ? You can 't be serious . I could never do that . I wouldn 't do it , no . No , I wouldn 't do it . I wouldn 't- - I wouldn 't do it . I wouldn 't do it . Ow ! [ voices whispering ] [ whirring sound ] Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! [ gasps ] Hadley ? Hadley ? [ whirring sound ] [ gasps ] Oh , honey , are you okay ? Why are you dressed ? Good things will come . [ smashing , thudding ] [ man groaning ] Hi . What are you doing ? I 'm leaving . I can 't do this anymore . Why ? What are you talking about ? Jamie , we 've been over this a thousand times . Please don 't do this to me today . When am I supposed to ? When it 's convenient for you ? [ phone ringing ] Don 't go anywhere . [ ringing ] Hi . Mom ? [ key hits floor ] Goodbye , Jaime . No . Sean , wait ! Too late . How am I doing ? Well , I lost my job today and Sean just left me . How are you doing ? [ ringing ] Coming . Thank God you 're here . I think a pipe broke or something . There 's water leaking everywhere . Come on . [ sighs ] [ sighs ] Well , um , I 'll be in the other room if you need anything . [ hair dryer blowing ] [ sighs ] How 's it going ? Can I get you something to drink ? Sir ? [ gasps ] Is everything okay ? Still under warranty , right ? Yep . [ sighs ] [ phone rings ] Oh , not now , Mom . [ ringing ] [ ringing ] [ moans ] [ screaming ] Hello ? [ crying ] Hello ? [ hammering ] [ phone clicks in cradle ] [ screams ] Oh ! Oh ! Oh , no ! Get off me ! Oh ! [ screams ] [ grunts ] [ lawnmower motor running ] [ motor stops ] [ door closes ] Why you gotta do that shit ? What ? You frickin ' reek . [ chuckles ] Too bad , kiddo . My car . I get outta the car , people think I smoke . Get outta here . You 're one to talk . Never pay attention , do you , Dad ? I quit , like , a month ago . Hmm . Yeah , right . I 'm serious . When the hell are you gonna quit ? Calms my nerves . The world is my ashtray , huh ? See a goddamn shrink , Dad . You 're killing yourself . And me with all that secondhand smoke . Hey , knock it off , Mike . Knock it off , would you ? You should take the money you spend killing yourself and invest it in someone who can calm your nerves . Enough . What 's this ? - Hey , give me that . - Ahh . - Give it here . - Where 'd you get this picture of Mom , huh ? I had it , okay ? You stole this ? I said I had it . Yeah , right . Ridiculous . She ain 't taking you back anyway . You don 't know jack shit . You can 't even commit to finishing a cigarette . No wonder Mom left you . She needed stability for once . I know who I am . Okay ? I know I got problems . And I don 't need you to psychoanalyze my pitfalls . Okay ? I 'm an asshole . I know it . Okay ? I admit it , all right ? But you better wipe your mouth before you talk any more shit to me about it . I love you , buddy , but in this world , there 's only room for one asshole . What the hell ? You quit , remember ? We better get going . We got a few hours . [ Mike ] You sure about this place , huh ? Maybe we should just skip . We got a couple other places on this block . Let 's just move on . This place looks like a dump anyway . That 's why we hit this place . See , it 's disguised . They want us to think they got nothing , okay ? It 's better than Beverly Hills . Cameras and fuckin Dobermans , man . I 'm getting too old for that shit . Are you sure they ain 't coming home soon ? Trust me . - [ mumbles ] - Come on , Dad , you know ? I got it , I got it . Too old for a few things , huh ? [ humming ] Baby , it 's all ours . [ door closes ] Call me when you 're inside , Alejandro , comprendre ? Sí , señor . [ crow cawing ] Okay . That 's a first . [ unzipping ] Just can 't get much easier than this . Okay , I 'm in . Gonna take a look around . Shit . What 's going on ? Give me a minute , will ya ? [ chuckles ] You gotta be fuckin ' kidding me . I 'm locked in . Oh , great . Relax . I can pick it . Don 't worry . Maybe we should go back to Beverly Hills . How 's it looking ? It 's looking great . Probably gonna need your help with everything . Really ? No , not really . [ sighs ] Not much on this level . What the hell 's the deal with this place ? I 'm going upstairs . [ Mike ] Find anything ? Hey , Mikey , this place is a bust . Looks like somebody 's already cleaned it out . And you know what ? I don 't think anybody lives here . Oh , great . So you 've been casing an empty house ? Quit busting my balls , will ya ? I 'm gonna search some rooms and then get outta here . Wha- - Jackpot . Might have something here . Just found a stash in a dresser drawer . Great . Load it up and get out . [ scoffs ] Damn . [ chuckles ] Yeah , baby , yeah . Ooh . I think this guy 's a thief . - What ? - Yeah , I mean , he 's got this- - this whole dresser drawer full of wallets . And they 're all full of cash . Cash will work . I just got a weird vibe , Mikey . Something 's messed up around here . Why would he leave all this cash in these wallets ? Just clean ' em out and go . Who cares ? Right . I 'll be right there . Holy fuck . [ woman ] Help me ! Please , God , help me ! Hello ? Please help me ! He 's trapped me in here ! He 's gonna kill me like the others ! Hey , Mikey . There 's somebody trapped in one of these upstairs bedrooms ... and a shitload of blood on the walls . [ Mike ] Quit messing around . I 'm serious , man . There 's this girl . She 's trapped in this bedroom . - [ woman ] Hello ? - Listen . Are you still there ? Don 't leave me here . Mikey , did you hear that ? Yeah , I heard that . Just get outta there . Well , it 's like this , Mikey , I- - I can 't do that . We gotta help her . How we gonna explain how we found her ? We broke in to this house . This could be a prank . Next thing you know , the cops are gonna show up . Hey . I 'm picking the lock . Just hold tight . He has a set of keys . Look for the keys ! What 's your name ? Gwen . Gwen Wallach . Hey , Gwen , all right , I- - I 'm gonna try and help you out here , okay ? Don 't leave me here . He 's going to kill me , I know it . [ rattling ] He 'll feed me to the machine . Who 's gonna kill you ? I don 't know who he is . [ sniffles ] Dad , you coming ? Forget about her . Hey , Mike , I can 't do that . I can 't leave her here . Hey , man , I 've done some shitty things in my life , and God knows I 'm an asshole , but this time I 'm gonna do something right for a change . Don 't be stupid . I 'm coming in . No , Mike . Five minutes . Just give me five minutes and I 'll be out , okay ? - Okay ? - Fine . Five , and then I 'm coming in . Oh , shit . Dad , get outta the house now . He 's home ! Come on , man . Just give me one more minute . You don 't have another minute ! Now ! Damn it , Dad ! Come on !

What do you mean , she 's dead ? There 's a friggin ' maniac in here killing people , and I 'm not sticking around to join ' em . Come on . Oh ! [ woman screaming ] Get the fuck outta there . This place is a fuckin mousetrap . I 'm trapped . It 'd take a goddamn chainsaw to get me out of here . I 'm coming in . No , stay where you 're at . There 's no sense both of us getting trapped in here . I can hold the door open . No , Mike . He doesn 't know I 'm in here , and I don 't want him to know I 'm in here . What do you mean ? [ squeaking ] Crap . [ squeaking ] [ groans ] [ groaning ] [ shatters ] [ groaning ] [ groaning ] No ! No ! No ! No ! Aah ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Aah ! Dad ? You there ? Mr. Watson ? Why are you doing this ? Why ? [ phone ringing ] [ ringing ] [ ringing ] Uh-huh ? Yep . I 'll find you . [ water running ] [ water off ] Fuck . Dad ? Come on , man . Hello ? Is someone there ? Please answer me . Who are you ? Jamie Blake . Where 's the other guy that came up here ? He took him . Who took him ? That guy , the repairman ? I think so . Who are you ? Hello ? I 'm here . - Who are you ? - Mike . Mike ? Just Mike . Dad ? Please help me , Mike . All right , stand back . I 'm gonna try to kick the door in . [ groans ] Son of a bitch ! - What happened ? - He must 've reinforced the door frame . Don 't worry . Oh , I 'm trapped in here . Shit . I 'm not good at this stuff . Fuck ! What ? Nothing . It 's okay . I 'm gonna look around . If I can find my dad , he 'll get you out of there . No . No , you can 't leave me here alone ! No ! Dad ? [ dripping sound ] Oh , sick . What the fuck is going on here ? I heard screaming . It was so horrible . - Did you talk to anyone else ? - No . Dad ? Hello ? - Fucker bailed on me . - What are we gonna do ? We ? Sorry , lady . I 'm outta here . They catch me for breaking and entering , it 's back to the can . I 'm not taking that risk . You just can 't leave me here alone . He 'll come back ! It 's not my problem . Mike ! No ! Fuck . You gotta be kidding me . Fuck ! [ footsteps ] I decided I couldn 't leave you here alone . You didn 't come back for me . You couldn 't get out , could you ? No . We 're stuck . God , what else today , huh ? Huh ? Why me ? Somebody help us ! God , somebody help us . He killed your dad , didn 't he ? What are we gonna do ? [ zipping ] I don 't know . Do you know him ? Who ? The repairman , Mr. Watson . No , I don 't . Then what are you doing here ? 'Cause that 's what I do . I break into people 's houses . Well , I 'm glad you picked this house to break into . Damn it . [ crickets chirping ] [ keys jingling ] Dad ? Mom ? Hello ? Help ! Dad , is that you ? Would you please open the door ? We 're trapped inside ! Who are you ? Where 's my parents ? I don 't know who your parents are ! Open the door ! If I could open the door , I would 've already ! There 's no doorknob . The locks are changed . What did you do with my parents ? Dad , I think somebody 's in the house , uh- - Where 's Mom ? What 's wrong with you ? [ thud ] [ panting ] Daddy ? Why are you doing this ? [ board squeaks ] [ whispering ] Jamie . Up here . He came back . Mike ? Hang on . Where 'd you go ? He 's going to sleep . I think I found a way to get us out of here . I 'm gonna try to get his keys . How do you plan on doing that ? If I can sneak into his room while he 's sleeping . Are you nuts ? If he wakes up , he 'll kill you . You got a better idea ? No . No , I don 't . Who knows how long it 'll take the freak to fall asleep ? [ crickets chirping ] [ snoring ] [ snoring ] Hurry ! Come on . Come on ! [ sighs ] Yeah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah !

It 's okay . We 're gonna get through this . We 're almost there . I just need you to focus . Okay . I 'm sorry . Okay . My keys don 't work either . What now ? We must 've missed a key . We can break out a window . What window ? I tried that . They 're all bricked up . There 's a phone in the kitchen . We could call for help . There is no phone . I 've tried everything . The key we need is probably up there . There 's no way that I 'm fucking going back up there . Just forget it . I don 't see any other choice . [ gasps ] Oh , Jesus . I 'm gonna come with you . It 's the least I can do for your helping me . Thanks . Thank me when get out of here . I got it . [ rattling ] Oh ! Aah ! [ screaming ] No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Aah !

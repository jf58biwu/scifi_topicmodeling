Sorry . Mister Banev . There you are . As far as I remember , you asked me about changing . - Correct ? - You 're right . Excuse me . You know ... what ... God knows what they 're having around here . The schedule has gone from here to hell and God knows where . What shall I do about it ? Two kilometers from here there is ... It 's all right , sir , I speak Polish . Oh , that makes it easier for me . All right . In about 2 kilometers there 'll be a station . You can rent a car or take a bus there . Sorry for the inconvenience . Thank you very much . Not at all . Sorry again . - Goodbye . - Goodbye . Directed by Konstantin LOPUSHANSKY Mr. Pilman , I need to talk to you . It 's important . I know you can hear and see me . I 'm a Russian writer . I write in Russian . In recent years I 've been living in America . Tomorrow I 'm flying to Russia . To Tashlinsk . No one knows I 'm here . Mr. Pilman ? I forgot to introduce myself . I 'm Victor Banev . Hands up ! So you speak Russian ? Yes . Put your hands up ! I 'm alone , Mr. Pilman . You have nothing to be afraid of . Do you know me ? Yes , from your photos . Until you explain how you found me , my finger 's on the trigger . And if I don 't like your answer ... I warn you , my answer will be very strange ... Shoot ! Well ... the thing is ... well ... uh ... I was put on the UN commission on Tashlinsk . And I got access to the files ... The more reports I read , the less I understand what 's going on . And not only you . Your reports were the most solid . Especially on ... the so-called wetters . I read that you disappeared from Tashlinsk . Someone tried to kill you , so the precautionary measures ... Stop ! You haven 't answered my question . How did you find me ? Mr. Pilman , may I put my hands down ? No . No ! Put them higher ! Higher ! It 's some tyranny , really ! I repeat : How did you find me ? I saw your house in a dream . The street name and number . Believe it or not . You may think I 'm nuts . Maybe I am . I have to admit I 've felt odd recently and ... Very odd . All right then . All right . Come up to my study . Thank you . I may be the only man on earth who can believe you , Mr. Banev . Please sit down . You came in a car ? No , I came by train . Strange . Very strange . Have ... a drink . - Have some water . - Thanks . - It 's hot outside . - Sure is . Mr. Banev . Excuse me for asking ... Why do you want to go to Tashlinsk ? I told you , I 'm on the commission . So you said . But how did you get on it ? You 're a writer . You don 't seem to have anything to do with the problem . Is it really for money ? Passion for sensations ? Oh God , what a world ! It 's always money ... Who said money ? Or sensation ? It 's the only way to get to Tashlinsk . The only one . Actually , I have a personal reason . Do you understand ? It 's personal . Sorry , I 'm not myself today ... Could I have more water ? - Of course . - Thanks . It 's all right . I understand . Fine . Ask your questions . So , first question : What 's really going on in Tashlinsk ? What 's going on ? What 's going on ? Good question . Remember Zurzmansor ? He knew it was a dream : burning woods , the sky black with smoke , city pavements melting ... The planet destroyed by an insatiable monster called ' man ' . Dr. Pilman , I have very little time . Let 's get to the point , shall we ? To the point . Everything 's fine . Park the car by the house . Don 't forget to leave the keys . Yes . I don 't think so . An hour and a half at most . No more . Alright , alright . I can 't talk now . We 'll talk later . - Have a seat . - Thanks . Were my archives of any help ? I don 't know yet . Some whiskey ? Just a bit . Cheers . Cheers . Well ... Who are they , the wetters ? - Do you have a theory ? - Yes , I have . What is it ? In a nutshell . In a nutshell , my theory is : They 're aliens . And enemies . - Enemies of whom ? - Of our civilization . Many analysts believe they 're at war with us . Nonsense ! What war ? Oh , come on . How many of them are there ? Ten or twenty ? And how many Christians were there at first ? And against them - the Roman Empire and Nero . And what had been left of that empire ? So there 's logic in it . It 's possible . - Why do they need the children ? - They 're the future . Whoever controls the children , controls the future . They control them ? I don 't know . Passengers going by a special flight to Tashlinsk , please register at counter number six . I repeat : passengers going by a special flight to Tashlinsk , please register at counter number six . He 's your ex ! It 's the fate of your daughter we 're talking about . There he is . Sorry I kept you waiting . The plane was delayed . It 's all right , we just got here . This is my husband . - Igor . Nice to meet you . - I 'm Victor . Why are we standing ? Let 's sit down . Yes . How long are you here for ? No time at all . I fly to Tashlinsk in an hour . Nothing will ever change here . Foreigners can do things that we can 't . I 'm going to give you the key to our apartment in Tashlinsk . I wrote the address in case you forgot it . I didn 't forget . Please drop by and check it . It might be flooded , or the windows broken by the wind , or thieves ... Ira used to check it , but I know nothing now . Sure , I 'll see to it . I wanted to tell you something , but maybe I shouldn 't . Igor , go get some coffee . Please . I didn 't like your tone the last time we talked about the documents . I don 't recall . In the first place , you have no right to judge me . You think I got rid of our daughter handing her over to an almshouse . You know you said so . No , I never even thought it . I want to tell you it 's not just a boarding school . It 's a boarding school for geniuses . You have no idea how much I paid to get Ira in there ! And for good reason ! I said all this because I wanted to clear it up . That 's all . That 's all . Lyuda , what 's all this ? Calm down . You don 't understand how it all happened . Who could have known ? I came here to join Igor and then it all began there . We could do nothing . No one can go there or out of there . You can 't even phone . I know how hard it is for you . You know I had a dream that Ira got sick and died . There were spiders all over her , horrible spiders with paws . They grabbed her and wouldn 't let . They were wet and faceless . Faceless spiders . It 's normal , that 's how spiders are . How can you joke ? Lyuda , I didn 't mean it . Igor ! We got to go . Please call if you learn anything . This way , please Thank you . Good evening . Please . Where 's your retinal scan ? It 's enclosed in the back of my passport . Do the scan , please . Blood test results ? It 's all here . - Lung analysis ? - All here . All right . It 's okay , you can go . Welcome to Tashlinsk , Mr. Banev . The main gate 's entry signal has also been changed . The new code for technical maintenance barges is 34-041-851-000-144 . For radiolocation support boats - 33-054-841-00-124 . Your argumentation is one of a military man . - Mr. Banev ? - Yes . I 'm Isaac Golemba . Hello , Mr. Co-Chairman . Just call me Isaac . Or Ike . - Gennady ! Gennady ! - Yes , yes . He 's the co-chairman from Russia . A famous scientist , Doctor of Sciences . - How do you do . - Nice meeting you , I 'm Gennady Komov . The Commission Chairman from Russia . This is Viktor Banev , the new member . Go on in , we 'll leave soon . I 'll join you . All right . - How was your trip ? - Fine , thanks . - How long is this trip ? - At least two hours . Really only 40 minutes . But there 's a double cordon . The Wetters' energy barrier . A complex control system . This way . Please . I see . I see . All this takes time . Settle in . I 'll be right back . Have to say goodbye to the military . All right . Thanks . Ike , what are my duties ? None anymore , I 'm afraid . What does that mean ? Don 't you guess why they gathered us all in the district 's center ? There was a meeting with the military at the joint chiefs of staff . And ? That 's it , it 's over . The commission will be disbanded any day now . The military plan to take action . What action ? Against whom ? Against the climatic anomaly , I guess . They plan mass cloud seeding with coagulants by the united forces of strategic aviation . But coagulants are chemicals . Won 't that poison people ? People will be evacuated . Children first . Isn 't that your concern ? Why do you think that ? Victor , please , it was my duty to read your file . As for your problem ... I can 't help you , but I won 't hinder you , either . Is it a deal ? Yes , thanks . - So , people will be evacuated ? - Yes . Good . And those wetters . Where will they go ? Nowhere . But that 's a chemical war against the wetters . What 's the formal reason for refusing them evacuation ? There 's none . Officially , they 're sick people . They can 't be let go outside the town , to prevent the spread of the epidemics . As you can see , their demagoguery is down pat . Which troubles me very much . It means they 're serious . - May I join you ? - Sure . We 've been discussing the weather . We 're making good time . - Here 's the flooded city . - Yes . Victor , go up on deck . It 's worth seeing . I 'm afraid we might get stuck here . Why ? Red alert in the crossing zone . I heard it on the radio . That 's all we need . We got a problem . Man in the zone . That 's it . Over . Has he been there long ? Spotted him this AM , already dead . The energy stroke was just horrible . Who 's this man ? Nobody knows . Looks like he got there on his own . - Journalist ? Looter ? - No one knows . Will you proceed ? We have to . What if you get stuck ? The new one never crossed before . What if ... What if ... Signal we 're coming . Post Five ! Signal the crossing zone . Repeat : signal the zone . Now Vic . Keep calm and think positive thoughts . We don 't know their criteria to admit people . So think about something pleasant , with no aggression . Alright , I 'll try . They got the signal . The bus is coming for you . - Shall we go ? - Let 's go . What 's the reading ? Energy barrier on red . We have to pull them out . I see the bus with the commission . But no wetter . Have to repeat the signal . - They 'll get stuck . - Wait . Don 't panic . There he is on the right , behind the bus . Victor , sit on my left . Where 's the radio ? - It took him long to examine you . - We 've got a new member . Controls ! Do you read me ? You can take away the poor guy . The wetter okayed it . I 'll be in room 16 . Call if you need me . Here 's our new member . He 'll live in the archive . In the archive ? But that 's the old building . We 've got good rooms in the new one , too . He 'll live in the archive . And he 'll work there as a member of the commission . As you say . Here are the keys . See which one works . Come on , Vic , I 'll show you the way . Recall the Shroud of Turin . There the body changed at the atomic level . Same with the wetters . It should be studied . I hope you agree ? You think the wetters' genetic change is the same ? .. Excuse me . Mr. Larsen , I 've been looking for you . I 'll wait . Okay . Go on , please . Are there always so many people here ? Only before a plenary . For some reason all the commissions hold them at the same time . - How many commissions ? - Only four left . Out of 13 . Can you believe it ? I 'd also like to draw your attention to one more thing . Besides that strange genetic disease which is interesting for biologists , some common illnesses begin to blossom that are infectious . This is due , I think , to the constant rain and infrared light in the sky , the origin of which we still cannot explain . That 's why I support the view that the climatic anomalies should be regulated . - How ? - Any way possible . Including the chemical one ? - Yes , yes and yes . - May I ? You all know perfectly well what 's going on , but for some reason you prefer to turn a blind eye to it . Let 's call a spade a spade . It 's an invasion . And we 're attacked by not Martians or the Antichrist , but something real . That 's why I again call for a vote on allowing laboratory studies of the Wetters and their pupils ! Because I need to know what is attacking us , and I 'm not going to get muddled in your snivels ! Mr. Sumak , what do the pupils have to do with it ? - They 're just children . - There you go again , children ! They stopped being children long ago . They probably aren 't even human ! Why are you so brainless , you humanitarians ? You pity them , don 't you ? Sure , they 're just smart little angels . Don 't you realize they 're the enemy from which we can only expect an inevitable and complete destruction of our world and us , too ! You think if a child quotes Kant and Hegel , then he 's really something ! But this child looks at you and sees a pile of crap . And he doesn 't pity you , because you are crap according to Kant and Hegel . You 're crap by definition . For them a human soul is garbage . A latrine of human physiology ! Try to understand they 're totally different ! There 's no place for us in their world . It 's them or us . It 's war . There can be no compromises . I demand we vote the question of allowing studies of those mutants now ! Calm down ! Let 's do it in order . What are we voting ? I demand this man be arrested ! It 's provocation ! We won 't vote on that point ! Yes , we will ! While they 're still here , while we still can ! What do you mean , still ? What are you driving at ? I mean they won 't let us out of here alive . Those mutant wetters won 't ! And you know it 's true , Mr. Komov . If we don 't do that secret study now , we 'll lose that chance for good . And their brains are precious . In short , I need a mandate for studying those creatures . An official permission . I demand we put to the vote the question of expelling Mr. Sumak from the commission . Expelling me ? On what grounds ? I 'm stating my position . Please don 't shout , ladies and gentlemen ! Get hold of yourselves ! - Excuse me . Are you Mr. Banev ? - Yes . - Someone wants to see you . - Who ? A boy . A boy ? - Where is he ? - Over there . - Where ? - The boy over there . Did you ask for me ? Are you Mr. Banev ? Yes . I 'm Weasel . My passport says I 'm Boris . But you can call me Weasel , okay ? Boris the Weasel . Nicknamed Weasel . All right . It 's not a nickname , it 's a way to put people off . - I don 't get it . - It 's a long story . I 'm here about something else . We want to meet with you as a writer . Who 's " we " ? The children . At the school . The school where your daughter is . You know my daughter ? We 're friends . Will you come ? Of course . When and where ? Tomorrow at 9 AM I 'll be waiting for you right here . Here you are ! Have a seat . We 've got a break . - Thanks . - Please . Victor , this is Diana , my close colleague . - Nice to meet you . - My pleasure . I 'm Victor . If she asks you for something , - and that might happen - consider it my request . Of course . I got you coffee . Thanks . Well , who came to see you ? Young admirers of my talent want to meet me tomorrow morning . Those writers are so vain ! But don 't delude yourself , Victor , they won 't admire you , they 'll dissect you . Will they implant electrodes in my brain and run me through a maze ? Good image : a maze . And who came ? A strange boy . Named Weasel . He spoke oddly ... How would you describe it ? As if a cat were laughing in my face . Amusing . Yes , it took them no time to get the feel of you . Should I get prepared ? Get some sleep . Listen to the radio station . Before that meeting , it would be helpful , and even necessary . What radio station ? The children have a radio station at school . It 's not very powerful , but still ... It 's on round the clock . For fallen humans like us . Listen to it . This is security ! Stop ! Stop ! What are you doing here ? It 's okay , I 've got my ID . Here . - All right . - Everything 's okay . How did you get here ? Were you hiding ? I wasn 't here . I just dropped in . I sensed there was someone here . Why did you come ? I came for you . You 're strange . Well , we 'll have time to talk . Go now . You can hear my voice , right ? Go . I would put it this way : The twilight of existence thickens into ashen shadows on the edges of austere objectivity . Uncategorized and nameless ghosts come close and invisibly pass through us . It 's here , at the apex of uncertain , unguaranteed and undefined human existence , that a certain clarity is first achieved and the global night is illuminated . The real , though horrible , meaning of our life not in a world , but somewhere between worlds , not in fixed reality , but in its displacement and formation , not in the home , but in aimless wandering . If I understood you correctly , you 're saying that truth has not been found yet , only the Mayan veil has been turned inside out and things can be seen from reverse , not from the side where he consoles and comforts , but from the side of Nothingness , which reveals that our own existence is merging with Nothingness . Well , yes , that 's one way of putting it . What 's that strange sound in the hall ? It 's in a room above . They 're studying hyperspace . Hyperspace ? Interesting . - This is an unusual school . - Do you like it ? Very much . - Here ? - Yes , go in . Thanks . Hello . Please sit down . So how are you , kids ? Is everything all right ? Do you miss your parents or not ? Tell me , is everything all right ? Everything is fine . Then let 's talk about literature . Would this esteemed audience like to hear how I write ? No . Well then ... What questions do you have ? How would you want to see us in the future ? It 's simple . Smart . Honest . Kind . I 'd like you to love your work and work only for the good of people . What 's " smart " ? " Smart " ? Good grief . Maybe you 'd like to ask what a " human " is ? Or what " time " is ? We know that question has no answer . But would like to hear how you answer it . I 'll try . So , a smart person is one who knows that his knowledge is imperfect and limited , who tries to learn more and succeeds in that . Do you agree ? No . Why not ? Your definition is not functional . By it any fool could call himself smart . And a successful fool will be considered the smartest of all . There 's an old aphorism that says a fool is just a person who thinks differently . Or feels differently . I don 't understand . You want us to be smart , that is , to think and feel like you . But I found nothing but negation in your books . Nothing positive . Thus a smart person like you can feel nothing but disgust for people . On the other hand , you want us to work for the good of people , that is , for the good of those disgusting characters who fill your books and whom you negate in every line . Can a smart person work for the good of disgusting people ? You see , by " work for the good of people " I mean changing them from disgusting to admirable . This is rather banal . It 's not a matter of what and how to change . The point is that the objects you depict don 't wish to be changed , as you say , from disgusting to admirable . You really think I write only of scoundrels ? I 'm sorry , I ... That 's not the issue here . I 'm thrown off because you talk like adults . But you 're children . And so maybe it 's hard for you to understand that this unshaven , dirty , drunken , hysterical coot might be a wonderful person , someone you feel like falling on your knees before and consider it an honor to shake his hand , since he went through such ... hell that it makes you shudder just to think of it , you know , but he still remained a human being . Excuse me for interrupting . Mr. Banev , you just found an apt symbol . Mankind is a hysterical , drunken coot , who went through hell . Yes , through hell , because , unfortunately , he doesn 't deserve better , and you know it perfectly well , yet you aver that man is noble but he didn 't get enough goods and happiness as he sees it , that is , the right to trample , use and abuse others . To sum up : You just can 't believe you 're already dead , that you created a world that is your gravestone , and nothing more . When I say " you " , I don 't mean you personally . - I hope you understand . - Yes , of course . I understand . And I 'm going to answer you . To destroy the old world and build a new one is an old idea . But it never worked . You may not know this , but you 're cruel . Perhaps your intentions are good , but cruelty ... is always cruelty . And it can bring nothing but more pain , more abuse , more deceit and ... - Sorry I 'm late . - No problem . I wanted to meet you very much . - You can call me Zinovy . - Okay . Please continue . Alright , where did we stop ? If I 'm not wrong , on the need for the profound spiritual and sensual renewal of mankind . If you 're interested in my opinion , I totally agree with that . I also see mankind at the crossroads : Either complete intellectual degradation or an unprecedented evolutionary leap in consciousness . I hope all agree ? - How did you like it ? - I liked it . Are you prepared for the test ? - Goodbye , Mr. Banev . - Goodbye , children . Thanks for coming . I thought you 'd be afraid . Why ? Never mind . I 'll tell you later . I can 't walk you out . Boris will . - Yes . - Why Boris ? Wait , I really came to talk to you . It 's very important . Really ? Then you 'll have to wait . - I have classes . - I 'll wait . - I 've got time . - All right then . - Take this , please . - Thank you . - This is for you . - Thank you . I want you to move in with me at the hotel . Right now . - Why ? - It 's easier to leave from the hotel . We have to leave under any pretext . I , as a member of the commission , and you , as my daughter . That 's why I came here . For what ? To take you away from here . Take where ? What difference does it make ? Anywhere . Don 't you see what 's happening ? Military everywhere . A chemical warfare might start in a few days here . Isn 't the military everywhere ? Ira , don 't play with words . You know what I mean . I have friends . I can do things . I know your school is great . But there 're better schools elsewhere , you can believe me . No . Why ? No to what ? No to it all . That you can do things , the school , and leaving . Listen . I beg you to listen . I know I 'm a bad father . But I have the right to take you from here . You have no right . Go . There 's the hotel . Go . Open up , Victor ! I can hear you 're home . Come in . It 's open . " A locked door is free , for the price of a key . " Wow ! Nice way to greet guests . Good for you . I 've fixed some dinner . - Already had some ? Good . - I have . Want to join me ? Nice digs ! - Mind if I look around ? - Be my guest . Victor ! You live in style , very spacious ! Spacious . Can 't get any better . Taking baths ? Good for your health . - Will you have a drink ? - Sure . Why not ? Victor , this city will do me in . It will . Bless you . Please sit down . Thanks . I 'd better drink while I 'm still alive . - All right . - Thanks . Cheers ! Cheers ! How was your first contact ? What first contact ? C 'mon , Victor , don 't be modest . I know the kids called you on the carpet , didn 't they ? Oh , that . Yes . It was an event . In what way ? It 's an event because we all went through it , one way or another , only , as an old acquaintance of mine used to say , everyone goes through it , but not everyone passes . It 's an event because that Sanhedrin of minors passed the verdict to pardon you , while they sentenced us all to death . That 's a sensation . The verdict ? What verdict ? The verdict is ... our local jargon . We believe the kids decide which adults are to live in the bright future , and which are not . You might at least cover your mouth . Good idea . Thanks . So I was saying , isn 't it clear ? Zinovy , the top wetter , thanked Golemba today for the great idea to include a famous writer in the commission . Did he ? And I had a feeling , on the contrary , that they didn 't approve of me . I think those wunderkinds ... I didn 't mean the wunderkinds . The wunderkinds have nothing to do with it . But their teachers ... What teachers ? Special ones . Wetters . Why do you all keep saying : wetters , wetters ? But no one can explain who they are ! - What is this ? - Why no one ? I can . Then tell me . Because all I hear here are just some hints . I will . It 's thought to be a genetic illness . Two weeks after the rain started in February , all this began . Their hair falls out . Their skin gets yellow and hard as rock . There 's some body transformation on the cellular level going on . A new species . That 's why they cover their faces . Now they think it 's not infectious , but back then ... they thought it was an epidemic . Then all kinds of odd things began . Miracles . Hence the commissions . That you know . It 's thought that either they have an extra gene , or , vice versa , they 're missing one . Maybe they 're not humans at all anymore . Who then ? I don 't know . Mirages , shells . Come on , tell me , have you ever seen such people ? It only seems they 're harmless . Just look at that energy barrier ! True , their ethics do not allow violence . They forbid it for now . All right , I got to go . I think I wanted to tell you something else , Victor ... No . Oh yes , Victor ... You 've got to take sides . Them or us . Who are you with , master of culture ? Is it important ? It is important . Because if you 're with them , then , excuse the pathos , it looks like you 're a traitor to mankind . No more , no less . And mankind doesn 't like traitors . All right . Good night . I 'm going . Oh , I forgot . That Chinese girl , Golemba 's aide , was looking for you . Diana . It might be urgent , since it was late . Though , it 's not any of my business . Goodnight . - Hello ? - Victor ? It 's Diana . I need your help badly . Can you come down ? - Can you hear me ? - Yes , I 'll be right down . Thank you . I see the sign . Which way now ? - I got there . I 'll call you back . - Here ? Yes . - Is he alive ? - Can 't tell yet . - Let 's get him out of here . - What ? I said , we can 't leave him here . Diana , the door , quick ! Careful . Hey , pal , what is it there ? My buddy had too much to drink . He needs some air . Just a second . Help me . Mr. Zakrevsky , security here . Can you come over ? Someone 's being taken from the lab ... Driver , come over here . Just a second , I 'll be right there . It 's okay , I 'm coming . - Do you hear ? Come here ! - I 'm on my way . How many times do I have to repeat ? Halt ! Stay where you are ! I 'll shoot ! Where to now ? To the old train station . Do you know where it is ? Yes , I know . How is he ? Alive ? He 's dead . Now I 'm sure . What did they want from him ? Omnipotence , I guess . To know the mysteries of science . To get new weapons . Or , maybe , money . Or never-ending virility . Human needs remain the same . Open the door , Diana . Victor , put him here . Rest up . When you leave , forget about this door , the station , and everything . Okay , I will . - At last . Where 's he ? - He 's dead . We were too late . You 're not alone ? You know outsiders aren 't allowed here . I 'll explain everything . This man is from the commission . He 's a friend . Victor , wait for me downstairs . Like the Ritz during the Flood . It 's called " Noah 's Ark " . Well ? I like it here . Me , too . There 's an example of the survival instinct for you , Victor . The basic instinct . - Look , a painting ! - Yes . If we assume your idea that climatic anomalies don 't just happen , then the wetters could be part of of the anomaly defending earth from us . Could be . Have you been open long ? Two days . Got to make a living . Want to come in the kitchen ? It 's warm and dry by the stove there . No , we like it here . As you wish . I 'll bring you hot sandwiches . Thanks . Ike . Do you know what this is ? Where did you get it ? Someone brought it to the hotel , said my daughter sent it . - Did you listen to it ? - Yes . It 's like poetry , or essays . I didn 't get it . - It 's not poetry , it 's something else . - What ? Hard to say . Sometimes the wetters have children make such ... imprints of consciousness . - Images of their sense of the world . - Images ? Yes . Why do you think she gave it to me ? Maybe so you 'd understand her ? Or at least understand anything . As I can guess , you had a fight , right ? Ike . Tell me the truth , please . - Are you hiding something from me ? - Like what ? Is it a genetic disease or something else ? Well , for example . Can I get it ? Yes and no . Ike , don 't joke with me . No , Victor , try to understand . It 's a different principle working here . If you don 't want to , you won 't get sick . That 's the trick . It takes longing . A longing so burning that you 're drawn somewhere else , to another life , different goals , other worlds . I had it , but it 's long gone now . Too late . About you ... I don 't know . The children still have it . That 's why they 're with them and not us . You said it well - longing . It takes a longing . I understand it , yes . Twice dead , living after God 's death , we seek our shadows in a stream of illusions of the sleeping world . We live in the world of total deception , numbers and ghosts , where words have faded and lost their meanings . The age of the profane . The age of unbearably Philistine existence . The kingdom of the banal , singing praises to its emptiness . Spirit has abandoned our world for good . Time is shrinking . There 's no time anymore . There 's no space . The agony of non-existence . The spirit of barrenness hovers above the orphaned world , doomed to ultimate loneliness . Fear fills the soul . Everything is finite . The last secrets have been revealed . The wind from the abyss burns our cheeks . Who said that ? I ask you , who ? Answer me . All down with baggage ! The buses will leave in 20 minutes ! Evacuation procedure ! Anyone here ? Anyone here ? Evacuation procedure ! Emergency evacuation ! Go on , go on , to the left ! Women get in the ambulance . Men in the truck . Victor ! Victor ! Isaac , where are the children ? They were to be evacuated first , right from the school . Get in the truck and we 'll go there . Get in the truck , quick ! Let 's go . - Where 's the information center ? - Over there . - Where can I get info about children ? - Ask the liaison officer . Have the children been evacuated ? There have been no children . - Write it down : 25 on 2nd floor . - Got you , 25 . Stop worrying . Three boats have gone already . They may be on them . They 're not ! I made inquiries . No , not 70 . 72 MPC . Do you read me ? 72 MPC . You promised us communication with the airfields . Can you reach them ? How can I stop the operation ? The planes are in the air . One thousand of them ! But what will happen to them if they 're dropped the loads on ? Is there anyone there or not ? It 's murder ! We need to connect to the coordination center . Do you read me ? - You promised ! - Damn you ! - Will you get me on the line or not ? ! - I can 't do anything ! - Something happened to the kids ? - They 've lost the bus with the kids . Diana is with them . They may still be in the city . - Can you reach Diana ? - No ! She hasn 't called . Gennady . Gennady , what should we do ? I don 't know . Go to HQ . I 'll stay here . - Come with us . - What if ... No . No , I need to be alone . Please go . Gennady ! Victor , where are you going ? Where are you going , Victor ? What are you up to ? Go to headquarters , Ike . - Where are you going ? - To find the kids . You don 't even know where they are . Are you crazy ? Give me your radiophone . The regular phone might not work . I 'll need updates . - The top red button . - I know . Victor , do you know the old train station ? Yes . I 'm almost sure they 're there . - I got you . Go now . - They 're there for sure ! Bus , stop at the checkpoint . Bus 365 , stop ! Call her again . Call her constantly ! All right . Diana , do you read me ? Over . Don 't hear you . Look . - What is it ? - The formula for the cloud seeding . It 's not just active . It 's monstrously active . After its fallout , nothing living will be left . It will be a toxic desert . I did smell a rat here ! What can we do now ? What should we do , Ike ? Ike , I read you . Victor , do you read me ? Wait , I can 't hear anything ! There 's no one at the station ! Yes , I copy . They 're at the school ! Diana called . There 's a problem there ... Go on , Ike ! I 'm listening . The problem is the children refuse to leave the city . Refuse to be evacuated . Diana 's with them . Wait , how could they refuse ? What does that mean , Ike ? Tell him about the formula ... The kids see that the wetters are being killed . They probably hope the military will stop the operation to save them . Roger and out . I 'll call , Ike . How much time do I have ? Wait ! Don 't hang up ! There 's no time , that 's the point . The chemical fallout may start in 20 minutes . I have the results of the last sampling . Do you understand ? Don 't try to leave the city . Find a shelter . Any one . The school will do . Find one there . But close all the air vents . Make sure it 's hermetically sealed ! Don 't let anything in ! I got it , Ike . I 'll call if I live . Over . Zinovy , what are you waiting for ? You think they 'll cancel the operation ? They won 't , Zinovy . I know it for sure . And what will happen ? You 've chosen to die and that 's your right . But the children ? Why the children ? They 'll die , too ! You 're so brilliant , you 're geniuses , you 're spiritual torchbearers ! But you don 't understand the simplest thing ! Why should the children die ? For what ? - It 's their choice . - No ! And you know it ! If you say just one word , they 'll go into the shelter and be saved . They only trust you . What else do you want ? A sacrifice ? Then ... Take my life ! I 'll stay here with you . But the children must be saved . The children must live . The children must live ! He 's right . That 's just what I said . This man is right . You must admit it . If you want , I can go to the children . - Or Arson can go . - No . I 'll go . Do you remember me ? I met you at the school when you came to speak to the children . Yes , of course . I 'm sorry we don 't have time to talk . There were so many questions I wanted to ask you . But it 's too late now . There simply wasn 't enough time to understand us . You know , I 'm sure we could have been understood if the world were a bit kinder . The children understood us . They did right away . Do you want to know the truth ? You 've already lost them . The children . Your children . They cannot go on like this . They don 't want to be the same . He who has seen the heavens is changed . Forever . Come on , kids , quick ! Move faster ! Come on , quick ! - Is there another door ? - Yes , but it 's open ! I 'll do it . Stay with the children . Hurry up , please . Sit down , sit down . Finally ! Victor , what 's that ? Nothing , it 's ... It happens sometimes . The batteries are just low . Why not turn the filters on ? We 'll get some air . We can 't . Don 't talk . Try to breathe sparingly . Dad , recite something . Round the turn , In the depth of the wood boscage , My future lies in store That 's truer than a pledge . You can 't induce it to debate or coax it . It is as open as a glade , Unfolding , Engrossing ... It is as open as a glade , Unfolding , Engrossing ... Thank you . Hello . Just a minute , Mr. Banev . I 'll get someone to escort you . We got a visitor . From the UN commission . Yes , of course , it 's all in order . Send someone down . - Fill this out . - Sign here ? - Your first visit to your daughter ? - Yes . Write here the number , day and time , and sign it . Excuse me , what 's this ? Fruit and chocolate . I 'm sorry , but it 's not allowed . Pick it up when you leave . Go on in . Thanks . Hello . Wait here . Go in . Go . Sit down over here . Ira , darling . How do you feel ? Were you sick ? Ira . Don 't you know me ? Ira , answer your dad . You recited a poem . I remember . A poem ? What poem ? We were in a cellar and you recited a poem . What did you do to her ? What 's going on ? Tell your daddy what you do here , what you watched on TV yesterday . We watched a show . You had to guess who was the worst . And why do children watch this show ? Because we have to like what others like . We have to be like others . You have to force yourself . Good girl ! You see ? She 's getting better . Ira , sing the song you learned , dear . Weren 't you learning a song ? Give me your hand . What injections have they been giving her ? You 'll have to ask the doctor . They give her what she needs . I 'll ask right now ! I will ! I 'll ask right now ! Mr. Banev ! I have the right ! It 's an emergency . He recited a poem . I remember . Who 's there ? Who 's walking there ? What is it ? Who are you ? How did you get in here ? I 'm Victor Banev . I 'm on the UN commission ! I demand that you give me my child ! Now ! So that 's it . I see . And your so-called " treatment " will be investigated at the highest level ! Is that all ? Now leave the territory of the center . You think you can order me ? ! What 's going on here ? Send up security ! This is madness ! On your feet ! Stand , I said ! Let him go ! Let him go , I said ! I want to know why I 'm denied the right to take my child from here . - You want to take her ? - Yes , I want to take her . All right , take Mr. Banev to the 5th Ward . - We shouldn 't do it . - Yes , we should ! He 's threatening us with the UN commission . Go on , Mr. Banev . Fill out the papers . Come in here where we can talk . Don 't misunderstand ... We 're doing everything we can for them . The best doctors , the best specialists analyzing the data . If that were only enough . Do you know the word ... " wilt " ? You move a plant to a new soil . And no matter how much you water it , it just wilts . It won 't take root . They 're like that . Everything in this world causes them pain . Our world is ... endless suffering for them . I think much time must pass before they learn to live again among us . I believe it 's possible . Let 's hope it 's possible .

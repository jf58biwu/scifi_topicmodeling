Look , we 'll just be in different high schools , that 's all . Yeah . So when do we go ? Idiot ! Avian influenza has struck a poultry farm in Izumino . Akane ... I 'll call home . So far , 7,000 birds have been killed . After the owner of Kamikura Poultry in Izumino , Tokyo reported a massive die-off among his birds Metro Tokyo authorities found the virus in the living birds as well as the dead ones . To hell with New Year 's cleaning ! Damn it ! ( 4 January , 9 : 13 a.m. ) Dr Ando thinks it 's a new kind of ' flu . Echo test . I saw this man . He was negative for influenza . He still is . Or so the test kit says . Check his wife for me . I think she got it from him . Thank you . Temperature is 38.8 . Do you know where you are ? GOT 1520 , GTP 828 , bilirubin 2.4 . Ready aminoleban . Easy ... Doctor ! Saturation crashing ! Fever , pneumonia bleeding , diarrhea systemic infection and multiple organ failure ... All the symptoms of influenza . But ... There 's bird ' flu at a poultry farm near here . As evenly as you can ! Take one tablet twice a day . Twice a day . Here 's water . Everyone who had contact takes Tamiflu , OK ? All of you stay in quarantine here ! Report fever or other symptoms immediately ! Start ! Transfusing ... When the ICU is clear of patients , get him in there . Ambu-bag ! Hide !

I 'll take over . Hurry ! Yes , Doctor ! Transferring . 1 , 2 ... What are you doing ? ! Sorry ! Here goes . 1 , 2 , 3 ! Please , save him ! - Hide ... - It 's all right . Calm down . Almost there , Mr Manabe . Mr Manabe ! Matsuoka , it 's been 30 minutes . Give it up . It 's over ! Why ? ! 3 : 28 ... ( 5 January , 3 : 28 a.m. ) Hide ... How 's Hide ? I 'm very sorry . He 's gone . No ! He can 't be ! You said he just needed to rest ! Didn 't you ! You said he had a cold and needed two or three days ' rest . You said that , didn 't you ? Why is Hide dead ? ! Tell me ! Murderer ! Hide ! ( Musashi Akiyama Station , Tokyo ) ( Sendai , Miyagi Prefecture ) Let me off ! A staff member 's infected . From the quarantine section . Check vital signs ! Doctor ? Dr Ando ! Report that it 's in the hospital ! Dr Ando ! Get him ! Bring a stretcher ! ( 5 January 2011 , 6 infected , 1 dead ) This is ER ! Dr Ando 's ill . Call support staff ! ( 6 January , 9 : 10 a.m. ) Last year in the Philippines , an avian-flu outbreak killed 32 . The disease was transmitted person-to-person . The World Health Organization contained the outbreak . A similar outbreak here could infect 2.5 million and kill an estimated 640,000 . So we should quarantine Izumino ? No . Yes , Minister . We must act . We don 't want to terrify people without reason . Won 't vaccine work ? We have avian influenza-based vaccine for 30 million people . It might not work against a virus transmitted person-to-person . It takes six months to develop a vaccine from a new virus . Which means Tamiflu is our only hope . ( Infectious Diseases Control Division ) Aoba General Hospital in Sendai reports a new type of influenza . I 'll phone them . Is the lab report done yet ? Not yet . We have to release this . We can 't until we isolate the virus ! The New Year 's holiday 's almost over . There 'll be more cases . We need more time ! I 'm meeting the investigators today . You can stay home if you like . I 'm OK . Take care . Bye . This is all your fault . Take responsibility . I 'm very sorry . You and your damn chickens . Suspicions about the infection are focusing on avian influenza . Sir ! You 're the farm owner ? What are you going to do about this ? Move on through , Tamura . Let us through , please . Move ahead . Morning . You 'll make us sick ! The whole room stinks ! Akane ... Let go ! It 's not proved ! They haven 't proved it 's our chickens ! Will those with fevers please go to the emergency entrance ! We want to avoid infection in this wing . Dr Matsuoka ! Possible infection . High fever , pneumonia . Put him in 71 . Report in five minutes . Matsuoka ... I 'm sorry about this . It 's all right . How was the family ? My daughter was on a date , and it 's hell alone with my wife . ( 8 January , 8 : 30 a.m. ) Eiko ! Tsuyoshi ... it 's been a long time . I am Eiko Kobayashi , WHO medical officer . Dr Kobayashi studied at St Harris Hospital in England . With the WHO , she has worked on Ebola and SARS outbreaks . Her team contained last year 's influenza outbreak in the Philippines . She will be in charge of countermeasures at this hospital . So what do you propose to do ? Isolate the infection here , and stop it spreading . To that end , the entire hospital will be sealed off . Wait a minute ! What about our other patients ? We 're the only general hospital out here ! The public depends on us . We can 't just ignore them . The infection is spreading around the country but it appeared here , and most victims are around here . So it 's our fault ? Do our patients have the H5N 1 virus ? We 're checking . Isn 't it a bit late to be still checking ? If it 's not , what is this disease ? As the first patient appeared in this hospital it will be taken over by the Health Ministry and Infectious Diseases Laboratory staff will be seconded . Who handled the first infected patient ? I did . Have you been abroad recently ? Do you have any idea where you caught this ? Do blood tests on anyone who 's been abroad recently . Have you any idea where you and your husband were infected ? Have you taken a trip abroad recently ? This is important ! She 's not up to this ! I need the answer ! Her husband 's just died . I 'll come back later , then . You haven 't changed . You 're still too nice to be a doctor . You 've changed . Your dream of working at the WHO came true . Yes . Because I left you and went to England . You don 't have to leave Japan to be a doctor . But because I did , I learned how to save more lives . That 's why I 'm here now . I 'd rather be a doctor with empathy . " What is it ? What does it do ? " " Where is it from ? How do we kill it ? " In other words ... " Identify virus " Then ' symptoms ' , ' routes ' , and ' treatment ' . We will conduct tests on patients here and isolate part of the hospital . Bloody WHO ! To contain the infection , infected and non-infected areas will be strictly divided . I 'll be your liaison . Anything you need , just tell me . I 'd like Dr Matsuoka as my liaison . I taught at the medical school he went to . And I won 't do ? I don 't need a minder . My answer is no . Oh , come on , will you ! Just keep an eye on her . Anyway , she asked for you . She did ? Find out where patients have been , and who they 've been in contact with . Dr Ando 's blood pressure 's falling ! Sorry ! Two more MAP units ! I 'll take him . Take over here . Order 5 units of plasma ! Blood chemistry , cell count ! Legs up ! Mrs Ando ? This way . In here . Dad ! Incubating . Fibrillating ! DC ! Connecting . Ready ! Clear ! Doctor ! Ambu-bag ! Hook it up . Nothing ! Bosmin , 1 ampoule ! I 'll do it . Please . DC ! Charge , clear ! Dr Ando ! Can you hear me ? ! I 'm scared . It 's weird . I 've seen so many die ... Now that it 's my turn , I 'm scared . Don 't be stupid ! Look ! Your wife and daughter . Cerebral hemorrhage ! Ready Glyceol ! Dr Ando ! Flatline ! Dad ! Doctor ! Dad ! ( 9 January 5 : 37 a.m. ) It looks like you 're a fine ER doctor . You 're everyone 's go-to guy . If I 'd paid more attention to that first patient Dr Ando might still be alive . None of this would have happened . ( Five days later ) Symptoms of the New Influenza . We 've waited three hours to see a doctor ! You admitted the one ahead of us . Why do we have to go home ? ! I 'm sorry . We have to give priority to the seriously ill ! If you can walk , we ask you to rest at home . You can be seriously ill and still walk ! Come on , please ! Your lungs seem all right . Stay home and see how things go . Out-patient . Doctor , I 'll take over . Wait here for your prescription . I 'm very sorry ! You 're abandoning us ! I 'm sorry ! We 're distributing masks ! Please take one ! Are you all right ? ! I 'm going into hospital ! Stretcher ! Over here , please ! No ! " Lumbar ! " Sorry ! Bitch ! Ms Suzuki ! Sorry . Send those samples to the Infectious Diseases lab . Doctor , triage out in the tents isn 't enough for a lot of those people . We can 't admit them all . We 'll be over capacity right away . We won 't be able to do this right . Then give everyone Tamiflu . Prioritizing patients causes trouble . There 's not enough ! Even the supply drivers are infected . It 's medical staff first , then people in vital jobs . And you 're forgetting something . What ? Be a bit more realistic ! Patients are getting worse even with Tamiflu . It 's not working ! It depends on the person . Do over there . ( 14 January 2011 : 9th Day ) ( 2,310 infected , 856 dead ) Open the gate ! Stop , please . All right , all right , stop ! WHO Medical Officer . Let me take your temperature . All right . As you see , there 's a net here . It 's unlikely it came in from wild birds . Mr Kamikura , you 're very well equipped . As you have analyzed avian influenza , Prof. Nishi I 'd like to hear your opinion . I 'll be blunt . Do you think this infection is a new form of influenza ? Mr Kamikura 's around these birds all the time , and he 's not sick . So you ... I wouldn 't know , Dr Kobayashi . I 'm only here to see what 's infected these chickens . I 'm sorry . This has caused the hospital a lot of trouble , too . I 'm sorry . Forgive me ! I 'm sorry ! Please ! Don 't do that . There 's someone here ! Excuse me . What 's wrong ? A suspicious person . Who 's there ? ! Show yourself ! There 've been rumors this might be bio-terror . Terror ? Gee , I never thought of that . There ! Tsuyoshi ! Call the guards . " Virus " Who are you ? ! Tsuyoshi Matsuoka . A doctor at City Hospital . Not an investigator ? No . Don 't scare me like that . Your hospital 's famous . You must be inundated . So what is it ? Huh ? The infection . Is it really influenza ? Do you know something ? No one will listen to some unknown researcher . I want to look at it , but I can 't get samples . That 's why I 'm here . There 's a virus race on . Everyone 's after the prize . There he is ! Get me a sample . I 'll find your virus for you . He got away . I 've been thinking about this . And ? The first patient didn 't infect me or the nurses . The in-hospital infection started when he came back . That 's when Dr Ando got it . Yes ... So you 're not infectious until at least the second day . But influenza is infectious before symptoms appear . Meaning ? What if this infection isn 't an influenza ? You think better than you used to . Hey ! I was afraid you hadn 't changed since medical school at all . Bleeding is similar to Ebola , and the fatality rate is over 60 % . Far more than our expectation . Even if we take this valuation into consideration , It 's unlikely that a new type of influenza . I see . I 'll tell the labs in all the different countries . " What does it do ? " ( 16 January , Osaka ) ( Emergency calls top 500,000 per day . ) ( Fear of ' the fatal infection ' spreads . ) Respiratory failure ! Vitals ? Temperature 38.5 , blood pressure 90 over 50 , saturation 95 . Positive ? No . Family ? Doctor ... Wait ! Where should this patient go ? We can 't handle this ! When do I get my extra staff ? Tomorrow . We 're short-handed . I 'll choose them if you won 't . Uh , no ... The whole hospital 's falling apart . I 'll make the choice , then . Do you know who she wants ? No . Aren 't you keeping an eye on her ? ! It 's a war zone over there ! Go and see for yourself . Japan is 8 hours ahead of Geneva . Yeah , so what time is now ? That 's right . Be good , even though mommy is not around . OK then , bye . Were you listening in ? That 's a bad habit . Are you married ? It 's this boy . I met him in a refugee camp in Croatia . Everyone needed medical attention . It was terrible . But he always had a sparkle in his eyes . He gave everyone strength . Even someone like me , there as a doctor . He was born with a heart defect . I wanted to save him , at least . When the fighting drove us out , I took him with me . I abandoned thousands , but I saved him . Don 't talk like that . Just now he asked me Is Japan really finished ? What are you doing there ? I couldn 't answer him . Really ... what am I doing here ? What are you doing ? I have an answer . An answer for that boy . Something I 've heard before . A doctor with a cold gets no sympathy at all , you know . I 'm going . Do me one favor . Believe in the staff here . If you 're going to lead them , they want you to believe in them . I am going to choose the staff to work full-time on this infection . Those who wish to , please raise your hand . This will be voluntary . As you are aware the work will be physically and mentally demanding . You will not be able to leave the hospital . That will be hard on those with families . And worst of all , there is the danger you will be infected . But without your cooperation , we cannot save our patients ' lives . So please ... help me . I will . 23 doctors , 54 nurses . Let us do our best . ( 19 January : 14th Day ) ( Infection is spreading across Japan . ) ( Japanese are barred from other nations . ) Sir ... Furukawa ... The cabinet has ordered measures to contain the influenza outbreak . All regions to be quarantined within 72 hours . That is all . Showdown time ! The public won 't like this , but we must be ready . ( 21 January 2011 ) ( 4 , 127 infected , 1,989 dead ) The region is quarantined , with no movement in or out . Those with symptoms are to notify authorities and the public is advised to avoid gatherings and stay at home . " Closed due to Outbreak of Infectious Disease " Hello , Ken ? It 's incredible ! I 've never seen an amusement park with no one in it . Where are you ? Sorry , I can 't come . What ? Why not ? We 're leaving Tokyo . Ken ! I gotta go ! Hurry ! Non-essential travel is forbidden under the Emergency Proclamation . Those suspected of being infected may not leave the region . Return to your homes ! You may not leave this region without a permit . Food and other necessities will be distributed to you . Please return to your homes . We 're not moving . What 's going on here ? ! Honey ! We 're not dying here like dogs ! Daddy 's company is closed . My kindergarten is closed . I 'm happy I 'm with Daddy . So work hard , Mommy . Don 't push ! Get in line , please ! Don 't push ! Someone will get hurt ! Don 't worry . There 's nothing to be scared of . OK , send the magic letter . " Thanks . Now I feel better . " Good . You 're much better . Coming through ! If I may ask you again , have you been abroad in the past month ? No . Or met anyone who has ? Excuse me . Doctor ... I 'm sorry about what I said . Not at all . Are there many people like me ? Yes , Mrs Manabe . Some even well enough to go home . No , I mean people who 've lost someone dear to them . Dad ! I 'm afraid it was too late . The Infectious Diseases lab has just announced it 's not influenza . Combining the results of investigation in our laboratories the U.S. Center for Disease Control and the WHO indicate that this epidemic is not a new form of influenza . Our conclusion is that no new influenza virus has been found . Then what is this virus ? ! That is under study . We know only that it is a droplet infection . Thus , like SARS , there is danger of airborne transmission . So this is a completely unknown virus ? Until the virus is identified it is too early to say whether the virus is known or unknown . So the bird ' flu in Izumino did not cause the epidemic ? No . At this point we see no connection . Murderers ! All of you ! Murderers ! Prof. Nishi ! Are you all right ? ! Yes . Mr Tamura ... Make sure that girl 's all right . Professor ... what happens now ? I 'm sorry . So has all we 've done been a waste ? Influenza or not , nothing changes for us . Did you know about this ? Well ? Say something ! Komori ! So what do we do now ? ! It 's a mess even now , without an unknown virus ! What 's the damn WHO good for , anyway ! Calm down ! I 'm fed up with this ! I want to go home ! " Deaths Rise Rapidly In Japan " " Why Did The Satanic Virus Pick Japan ? " More Than 800,000 Infected , 420,000 Dead In Japan . Government Takes ... Isolation Measures , Mysterious Disease Is Given This Name : Blame . The word connotes divine punishment . But why has this divine wrath been visited only on Japan ? The U.S. Center for Disease Control yesterday issued predictions for deaths from the epidemic . It says numbers could rise as high as 80 per cent of the population . ( Transit facilities are shut down . ) ( Social fabric begins to unravel . ) Are you sure ? She 's hiding something . That 's why she sneaked out ? She 's scared . It is a crime to conceal the sick . Many police and military are also ill . Cases of looting and theft are on the rise . - Stand back ! - There are sick people here ! Hold it ! Move ! Let go ! Leave us alone ! Run ! Halt ! Let go ! Stand back ! On your feet ! No ! Help me ! Come on . Please take precautions against theft and break-ins . Food is distributed every two weeks . My father is a doctor in Abon , a small country in southeast Asia . He came home for a visit at New Year 's . Dad ... The spiced sake 's ready . I 'm coming . Well , since " Father " has come all this way ... Wait ... Hidetoshi ... Take good care of Asami . " Father " I will . Thank you . OK , Dad ! Thanks . Let 's have a toast . To New Year 's , and to our wedding . Felicitations . Cheers ! Now I think back on it , he didn 't look too well . Where did he go then ? He was going to stay a week but he said he had to get back , and left the next day . You OK ? Here . Are you OK ? Excuse me ! There 's been no word from him since . I 've called and called , but no one knows where he is . I 'm scared . What if he brought that disease , and all those people died ? Thank you , Asami . Thank you for telling us . What you mean ? You have no idea ? Please send someone A.S.A.P. Dr. Kobayashi , we heard that you 've been giving treatment on the site . We are short on staff . If you , our medical officer , gets infected , we 'll be completely lost . I 'll take care of myself . More importantly , please do what you can about what we just discussed . Don 't expect anything . Abon 's not even in the UN . They won 't cooperate on influenza samples so the WHO can 't tell how things are there . Any ideas ? All I know is right there . Yes ? I 'll be right there . Saturation 's falling . We 're short of respirators . Then do something ! Respirator ! They 're all in use . That boy 's in multiple organ failure . He won 't last long . Bring his . We can 't do that . He 'll die ! We 're short of everything ! The guidelines say to favor those with the best chance of survival . Syringe pump ! Go on ! You do it . She 's still low ! Respirator ! We don 't have one ! Doctor ... We will save every patient that we can . I 'll do that . Thank you . Take this . Switching over . Prepare to incubate . - Right ! - Right ! I 'll do that . Incubation . Yes . I have it . Respirator ! And here , too ! Ms Suzuki , use this . Right . Take over . There . Thank you . 22 : 56 , death confirmed . 22 : 57 , death confirmed . Dr Kobayashi ! And she had a respirator ... I can 't . I can 't do this ! I quit ! I can 't do it any more ! Sorry ! 12 patients dead . The others are stable . You don 't mind ? This is a crime , you know . I 'll take any chance I can , even a faint one . Please ! Find that virus for me . It 's not a faint chance . It 's a sure thing . Thank you . You 're our only chance . I won 't be of any use . I can 't find the virus myself . There 's lots of virologists . It has to be you ! Why ? You should know why better than anyone . You mean Mr Kamikura ? I treated the first patient . For a while I only wanted to make up for my mistake . But not now . Now I want to stop people dying ! I think you 've already heard from Eiko , but the republic of Abon became independent just recently . And it 's made up of a group of islands . Their sole industry is raising shrimp for export to Japan . And the government doesn 't have complete control of all those islands . This visit isn 't officially a request from WHO . Don 't expect me to be much help . ( Medan Island , Republic of Abon ) Does anyone know where the clinic is ? Where is the clinic ? Does anyone know where the clinic is ? - Where is the clinic ? - Where is the clinic ? Thank you . Let 's go . Looks like it hasn 't been used for a while . I 'll check around the back . Hey , what are you doing ? In here ! What did you find ? December 27th . Treated a woman from the shrimp farm on Minas for what seems to be a cold . Open your mouth . OK , I 'm just finishing . Doctor , am I going to die ? It 's probably just a cold . There 's no reason to be afraid . But many people are sick like me in the Mines Island . It 's everywhere . Really ? Has it really affected so many people ? Yes , well ... no ... I shouldn 't tell any people . Japanese doctor ? To the shrimp farm ? Mines Island ? Did anyone take the Japanese doctor to shrimp farm ? Japanese doctor ? To the shrimp farm ? - It 's a shrimp . - Mines Island ? Is that true ? Yeah . He said he took a Japanese man with a big mask to Mines Island . Mr. David . Let 's go to Mines Island right now . I 'll wait WHO 's instructions . Why so many process ? Mr. Nishi ? Mr. Nishi , you do know what kind of viruses it 's carrying , don 't you ? Professor Nishi . Is the virus really that evil , Mr. David ? What you mean ? Isn 't the virus that causes all the ciaos in Japan now ? Isn 't it ? Mr. David , we are running out of time . Are you sure , you won 't give up ? I just want to find this infection as soon as possible . Follow my instruction please . Dr David 's mad ! I don 't care . I don 't work for the WHO . We don 't need to obey him . Mr Matsuoka you 'll do . Mines ... A man saw a witch form the forest and tragedy started . I cannot go anymore . I cannot go . There 's no one here either . There 's so much antibiotic it 's killed the soil . We 're reducing the place we live by our own hand . We 're like a virus ourselves . If a virus kills its host , it dies , too . Still it eats away at that host . Silly , isn 't it . Mr Matsuoka , could humanity perhaps co-exist with viruses ? With viruses ? You think that 's strange ? No . It 's something I started thinking when they said I had cancer . Mr Matsuoka ... Let me rest . I 'll look up ahead , then . Sorry . Are you okay ? Calm down ! Professor ! Stop . Look out ! I 've come to help you . No . It 's okay , calm down . We are not your enemy . We are your friends . Do you understand ? Friend ! No enemy . Don 't shoot . Friend . I 'm your friend . It 's okay . I hear the same language that doctor ... Are you all right ? ! Are you all right ? Did you see a Japanese doctor who came here ? He gave us medical treatment , and he died from the disease . He was a wonderful man . Thank you . Professor ... I 'll stay , too . If you stay who 'll take the samples back ? But you 'll be ... I 'll be fine . I 'm sharing my body with the cancer . It 's not my enemy . You know , I think coming here with you was a very good thing . I feel like a young man again . See you in Japan . Mangrove swamps are a communal resource , used in various ways . When they are cut down for shrimp farms , the people must go into the jungle for wood . Late last year a man who had gone deep into the jungle fell ill . He saw the Witch of the Woods and was cursed people said . Suddenly the man died . His disease spread to those who lived around him then to those they dealt with until it had spread over the entire island . " Where is it from ? " The shrimp farm tried to hide this . The village and its boats were burned , and the island abandoned cut off from the outside world . Hey boy ! Leave it ! My father ... The house is burning . Come on . I 'm worried about Asami . I hope I didn 't spread the infection by going back to Japan . May these notes be useful to anyone who comes looking to cure this disease . Shuji Tachibana . That 's it ! I 've found it ! What happened ? What are you doing here ? Its isolated virus turns ... On this occasion I would like to announce that we have isolated the virus . We have found that it is the same virus found on Minas Island . We ' have ? I 'm the one who found it ! The infection began on Minas . Professor Nishi is on the island conducting an investigation of bat tissue there . Vaccine development will proceed as fast as possible but will take at least six months . We will make all efforts to ensure this target is met . " Identify virus " " How do we kill it ? " Tsuyoshi Professor Nishi is dead . I see ... You don 't have to hold it in , you know . Crying would be being rude to him . Yes ... " Facility Quarantined " Great , huh ? She can go home now . - Mei ! - Mama . Thank you ! Bye-bye . Takako ! Mom ! Mai ! I 'll be home soon . When ? In a while . Be patient . Take care of yourself . I will . You take care of Mai . Try and stay inside , OK ? I 'll try . Bye . We 've found the virus but we can still only treat symptoms . But please don 't abandon hope . I believe that your efforts will see us through this crisis . Now I am leaving for Nagano . Um I was moved . When you all raised your hands , I was very ... Thank you for working with me . Why the long face ? I 'm worried . It 's hard when you think how many people ... are still going to die . One day , if the world goes back to what it was I 'll come to you . You didn 't say that then . Bye . Eiko don 't push yourself . You do that sometimes . I 'll be waiting . Come to me . I promise . It 's snowing . You 're right . Send Mommy a magic letter . Mommy , there 's snow falling down from the sky . OK ... The first snow I 've ever seen . Doctor ! Nurse Mita 's collapsed ! Would it be possible to visit her ? All right . Meals will be served at the tent in the schoolyard . Hurry it up ! Dr Kobayashi ! We 've been waiting for you . I 'm glad you 're here . I 'm sorry . I seem to have been infected with " blame " . I shouldn 't be infectious yet . I 'll handle the seriously ill patients . But ... There are things I can do . Akane ! Akane ! Hey ! Wake up ! Don 't ... you 'll get sick . I told you not to come , didn 't I ? I 'm sorry . I abandoned you . I didn 't care if I lived or not . Don 't think that ! You can 't die ! Akane ! Oxygen ... Ready for transfusion . Laryngoscope . Pressure 75 over 40 . Dopamine , 10 . Extract . Excuse me . Daddy Mommy hasn 't answered . I know . Akane ! No ! You can 't come in here ! Akane ! Pulse isn 't returning . Add 4 units MAP , and 2 ampoules of Meylon for acidosis . Mrs Mita ... She 's fighting for her life . Do your best for her . Meylon , 2 ampoules . This one 's critical ! She 's yours . Don 't lose her ! Transferring . 1 , 2 , 3 ! Doctor ! Come on , Takako ! Don 't die ! She 's a nurse here . We haven 't seen her in weeks ! She 's all alone now ! At least let us see her ! Please ! Let us in ! All right . Wait here while I check . Oxygen up to 6 liters . Echo result ? I 'll check . This girl ? 101 over 52 and rising . She 's stabilizing . Carry on . It 's from Mommy ! Dear Mai ... When there 's enough snow , let 's all build a snowman . Mommy loves you . What 's wrong , Daddy ? Don 't cry ... How 's Akane Kamikura ? She 's stable right now . Great ! " More than 3 million dead . " Now you 're cleaned up . Are you all right ? Gauze . Solulact open . Call that boy . What ? ! I don 't want her to die alone . Wake up ! Come with me . There 's only a slim chance it will work . And it could kill you . It 's too risky . I can 't approve it . If it proves effective , it could save thousands . A slim chance is better than none . Dr Tatebayashi ! Akane ... Akane ! It 's OK ! Reservoir mask . 3ml of Dormicum ! Stand back . Check pulse ! Doctor , a video call from Nagano . I 'm busy ! I 'll hook it up . Dormicum . Dr Matsuoka ! Tsuyoshi I went and got sick . Doesn 't look good , huh ? I feel stupid . Forget about that now ! I 'm going to try a different treatment . If it works use it there . In Africa , when there was an Ebola outbreak we transfused blood from people who 'd survived . It saved some patients . It 's not tested and proven . The European doctors were all against using it . But the doctors from Zaire pushed for it . It saved five out of eight . There was no other option . They had to save their colleagues no matter what . RBC , 2 units . Call Endoscopy if she keeps coughing blood . For my last shot I 'm going to try it . " Last " ? Don 't say that !

I 'm Eiko Kobayashi . I 'll be assisting you this year . How do you do . Dr Kobayashi ? What made you decide to be a doctor ? When I was in high school , my younger brother developed a brain tumor . The day before he died , he said to me Become a doctor and tell people like me there will be a tomorrow . Even if the world ends tomorrow , plant an apple tree today . He liked that line . Why ? Why did I forget that ? Eiko ... You planted an apple tree . I 'm sorry I was so rude in class just now . " How do we kill it ? " Dear Dr Matsuoka ... Thanks to all of you , the city has come back to life . Although Dr Kobayashi 's treatment saved a lot of people we 're told they 're still investigating it . But I think there is a direct connection between her courage and all of our lives . I am grateful to all of you . Is it cold up in Hokkaido ? It must be hard working in a town that had no doctor . Please don 't become discouraged . When I get depressed I remember what you told me . Thank you very much . Are you taking your medicine ? Even if the world ends tomorrow plant an apple tree today .

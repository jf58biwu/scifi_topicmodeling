 LAURA : Previously on Surface . Wait , something 's wrong . Something 's coming up . ( SHRlLL SHRlEKlNG ) This is where you first encountered it . The exact latitude . But that can 't be a coincidence . There are consequences here beyond any you may have imagined . Is that a threat ? ( ALL screaming ) KADEE : Look out ! Oh , my God ! AP 's reporting that the lake collapsed into a sinkhole . So far it 's getting traction . Containment 's my specialty . rich : George did not drown ! TRACY : Hon , I don 't think you were in your right mind . GEORGE : Rich . MAN : Rich ! ( PHONE ringing ) You 're spilling , man . Rich , honey ? My brother , George , he 's still alive and he 's talking to me . I hate it when he does that . That is so sick . I don 't think Sylvia 's gonna be down with your little goblin gulag . If you tell Mom about Nim , it 'll be war . ( SAVANNAH SCREAMS ) Miles ! Miles ! Miles ! It 's okay . ( NlM PURRlNG ) Good morning . It 's heaven on earth here . I may never come home , Donald . Hey , they think my fee 's too high , tell them to get another malpractice attorney . lisa : Hey , Mom ! Mommy 's working , honey . There 's monsters in the water . I 'm not the one who left the Roticulator cartridge in Mr. Adler 's ... Mom ! Hang on a second . What is it , honey ? You know , the kind you eat . The cala ... Calamari ? Yeah , that 's it . Put that ... Put that down ! Where did you get that ? Over there . Can I keep it ? ( NlM SQUAWKlNG ) You like your new home , boy ? Watch this . I 've been working with him . Go ! Nice ! Let me try . Let me try . All right . Last goldfish . He 's eating me out of house and home . Hey , you got any money ? Dude , if I had any money , would I be hanging with you ? Maybe we can advertise him , like a monster truck rally . " Nimrod ! Nimrod ! Nimrod ! " No . Negative . Not happening . And chicks , man . Chicks dig anything with big , round eyes . Something they can cuddle . News flash . He 's a secret . Think about it . Who wouldn 't pay to see this ? Go ! ( groaning ) Whoa . ClRKO : They have to understand . The species has burrowed into the lithosphere ... That will mean nothing . ... bringing hot magma to the surface . There is evidence of undersea eruptions , the heating of the world 's oceans , which in turn is affecting the Gulf Stream . You know that unequivocally ? " Know " is a strong word . Well , have you captured one ? You know we haven 't . Do you know the extent of the species ? Forty-nine sightings in less than five months . Is the species a product of evolution ? Hibernation ? Is it from here ? Is it from somewhere else ? We are eliminating possibilities every day . My point is , don 't go talking about how the sky 's falling till you have a way to back it up with proof . Theory won 't cut it . Ladies and gentlemen , Dr. Alexander Cirko . This , ladies and gentlemen , is a northern snakehead . Native to China , it 's distinguished by its small head , large mouth , big teeth and its ability to walk on land . The snakehead can survive out of the water . It has a particularly voracious appetite . Since its accidental introduction into the Potomac River , it has decimated the local fish stocks and tipped the river 's ecosystem . It is what is known as an invasive species . But another invasive species has emerged into the world 's oceans , a species unknown to science , a species I have been appointed to investigate . This is what we know . The animal has a confirmed length of over 200 feet . There have been 49 sightings as far north as the Bering Strait and as far south as the Cape of Good Hope . The species is an omnivore , feeding on everything from blue pointer sharks to killer whales to , possibly , human beings . It is my opinion that , if left unchecked , the species will throw the marine ecology off its axis . Where does it come from ? Its origin is unknown . Its consequences are not . GEORGE : Rich . Did you just have another ... Yeah . George ? Yeah . He 's not dead . DR. DAVEY : Well , the radiologist looked at your mri , Rich , and so did I . rich : Okay . Well , there 's no evidence of a concussion from the accident , no brain hemorrhage , no infarction , no plaque that might indicate MS , no tumors . Okay . Which is ... Well , no brain tumor is always good news . So I 'm okay ? Physically , yes . But why don 't you tell me about your experiences ? My experiences ? Tracy tells me you keep reliving the accident . Hon , Dr. Davey thinks you might have post-traumatic stress syndrome , or ... rich : And how long have you all been talking about me ? I 've talked to him once or twice over the last two days . You don 't believe me . TRACY : I don 't know what to believe . Look , Doc , this ain 't no syndrome , okay ? This is real . My brother is trying to talk to me . What makes you think your dead brother 's trying to get in touch with you ? Faith . WOMAN 1 : This calamari is breaded . Yes . Fried calamari . Well , I assumed that it would be pan-fried . Right . ( GLASS shattering ) WOMAN 2 : Yes , and I would like melted organic butter . Yes , ma 'am . One de-breaded calamari , one hand-melted , Board-certified , cruelty-free butter . MAN : Excuse me . Come on , Miss PhD , you gotta pick up ! Can I get a pan-fried calamari and a yuppie butter ? Let me explain how this works . I say , " Push the squid , " you say , " Yes , sir . " MANAGER : Clean it up . JACKSON : I usually like my calamari pan-fried . Do you know how much squid the Amber 5 caught today ? Almost two tons . Jerry said the ocean 's full of them . Starting to skeeve me out . Whales , Jackson . Whales feed on squid . Tons and tons of squid . Except they 're not . Either these whales ' migrations have been so disrupted that they 're avoiding their normal feeding grounds or something 's feeding on them . Remember that pod of grays that I was studying ? Not taking you whale-hunting . This time of year , they 're right off the Farallons . Like clockwork . I need to track a whale by satellite . If I can do that , then I can finally find out what they 're running from . Process , D. I said no . I 've got tapes . I 've got low-end whale calls on tape , a transducer . We can just call them in . Plus , Jackson , you 're the only person I know with a large enough boat . And , yes , I admit it . I 'm totally using you . You think you can just show up here , convince me to chum a whole day and night and spend a tankful of diesel just so you can go out and play Captain Ahab ? Yes . I like your style . ( ROCK music playing ON STEREO ) Mutant ? Help you with something ? Yeah . Is this all you got ? You owe me . $ 80 plus tax for the jewelry box you and Slimy broke . Not you , his other Slimy . Oh , that . You know , why didn 't you say so ? Okay . Thank you . You little creep ! That was some Valentine 's gift you gave Greg . Can you imagine what Mom and Dad would think if the originals just fell in their hands ? And the money . You 're going down . Bye-bye . Have a nice day . Pharmacist said this is gonna make you feel less anxious , okay ? Hell , I don 't want that . Well , you don 't get to want it , hon . All right ? The doctor said it would help . You need to take it . Baby , how many times do I gotta tell you ? George is trying to communicate with me . Now , I gotta be able to listen . Honey , come on . Come on . Let 's put that away , okay ? TRACY : Let 's go . You 're gonna have play time . All right , kid . Game tied , count full . You got a threat to steal at first . Curve . But you don 't have the control . Give them your money pitch . Fastball , high and tight . ( DOGS barking ) ( FLUTTERlNG ) What ? KENNEY : ( ON COMPUTER ) Last month , our first weather balloon came down in a soybean field in Nebraska . Since then , we 've lost 30 , most recently in Muncie . It dropped 50 degrees in the Mojave last night . The jet stream 's moved 100 miles north . Meanwhile , I got a frozen lake in Manitoba that melted in about two days . Oh , yeah , look at this . Baseline water temps are up almost two degrees . That 's not seasonal . It 's not even regional . I mean , in every ocean , every reading we have . Greenhouse effect . This can 't be explained atmospherically . I mean , you know . It 's coming from the deep ocean . Your neck of the woods . Thank you , Brad . If you would send the rest of your data here , all of it . I have a federal emergency order . That 's okay . I trust you . Just tell me where you think this thing is going . Straight to hell . ( ROCK music playing ) SAVANNAH : Would you go out with him ? He 's not even a quarterback . AMBER : I don 't care . He 's cute . SAVANNAH : Yeah , he is . I have a question . You think Phil is cute ? ( ALL laughing ) Chill out , man . Have some patience . Amber Lu will never be interested in you . She 's a sophomore . A hot sophomore . ( SQUAWKlNG ) I know you 're hungry , Nim . I 'm working on it . What 's the worst that could happen ? He starves to death ? Not him , me . Amber could do a lot worse than me . A lot worse . What 's up , ladies ? Amber , do you smell something ? Oh . Hi , Phil . Meow ! So , Amber , you like pets , don 't you ? Uh-huh . 'Cause me and my boy , we got something phat up at the crib . What ? Secret . Gotta check it out for yourself . But I 'll tell you this . It 'll eat a goldfish right out of Miles ' hand . How is Miles ? He 's good , real good . Why you wanna know ? I think he 's cute . Barf . I do . Well , hey , then , I gotta jet . You should definitely come over sometime . Definitely . Tell Miles I said hi . I have insurance , don 't I ? And it covers plumbing . Yes , ma 'am . But only if you use accredited plumbers , Mrs. Baucom . I 've been paying my insurance 42 years . I understand . Why don 't you just show me where the extent of the damage is , okay ? It 's over here in the side yard . See for yourself . It 's a nightmare . What ? What ? What ? In what ? What ? Believe in what ? Mr. Connelly ? ( pipes CLANGlNG ) Everything all right ? ( rich GRUNTlNG ) Mr. Connelly ? Mr. Connelly ? Damn it , what ? They should be here . Mothers and calves usually come pretty close to shore . Wait . There . There . Let me see . It 's driftwood . I don 't understand . These whales gotta get down to Baja to breed . I haven 't seen a single orca or dolphin this entire trip . They 're usually chasing my bow . Daughtery . D. ? What ? What happened here ? Rabbit traps ? I can 't afford to keep buying Nim 's food , so I 'm gonna start catching it . Rabbit bait . ( humming ) Dude , talked to Amber . Told her she ought to check out Nim sometime . What ? Dude , she 's into it . She loves pets . She 's got that little dog , what 's-his-name . You sold out Nim so you could get with Amber Lu ? Dude . Rewind . She 's interested in you . I know . I didn 't believe it , either . That 's not the point . We can 't share Nim . Whoa , dude ! We 're 14 years old . We have to chase girls . That 's our job . That doesn 't mean ... I 'm not letting you go all Willard on me , okay ? We need to get to first base with a non-amphibian . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna see if any of them are still alive . Do the words " shark bait " mean anything to you ? This wasn 't a shark that did this . Okay , how 's that ? The way it 's torn in half from below . It 's probably a killer whale or something . Okay , that 's it . This boat leaves in 60 seconds . Or maybe a school of predators , parents teaching their young to feed . ( WATER splashing ) Daughtery . I think I 'll stay in the boat . Great idea . Jackson , come on , come on . We can 't let it get away . Hang on to something . I said hang on to something . I 've gotta document this ! Stop . Stop it . Stop the engines . I don 't think he likes being chased . You 're not out here looking for whales , are you ? ( CREATURE growling ) ( GROWLlNG ) Nothing . Hey , Daughtery . Hey . You all right ? It 's been a long day . Fools . They don 't see what is right before them . I understand there are caveats , but what 's worst-case scenario ? The earth sustains geological , meteorological cataclysms on a scale not seen since the Old Testament . These are men that deny the greenhouse effect . Is that how you intended to silence me ? By requiring proof ? No . That 's how I intend to help you . girl ON TV : Okay , okay , okay . Here . BOY : I wish I had another marshmallow . I just gave you one . Yeah , I know , but it seems like ... Stop right there . I am not giving you another one , and that 's that . But you can 't make the ' smore with only one marshmallow ! Hey , girls . Hey , guess what Daddy got for you ? What did you bring us , Daddy ? Fireworks ? Yeah . Come on . Let 's go shoot them . Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! rich : There it goes ! ( ALL cheering ) Just like the Fourth of July ! Here goes another . ( rich laughing ) Isn 't this awesome , girls ? emily : Uh-huh ! ( PHONE ringing ) HEATHER : Yeah . Hello ? Wait a minute . I can 't hear you . ( whooping ) Thanks . I appreciate that . Don 't let the yellow smoke get on you ! It 's gonna burn your skin ! Here goes another . Everybody else is having to work , and we get to have fun ! ( rich cheering ) Heather ? Emily ? In the car , right now . Huh ? What ? Why ? What 's the matter ? Planning on telling me that you lost your job ? Oh , honey , no , it 's medical leave . There 's nothing wrong . Everything 's fine . Dad , you got fired ? No , honey . How are we gonna live , Rich ? Huh ? Why will you just not take your medicine ? Because I 'm not sick ! Healthy people do not hallucinate , Rich ! You need to take it . No , I don 't . Okay , forget it . Girls , in the car . Right now ! Oh , baby , come on now . You 're overreacting , honey . No . I 've made up my mind , okay ? When you can call me and tell me that you are the sane , happy , fun guy that I married , I will be back . But I am . I am that funny , good man . I 'm just clearer ! You are not . You are completely in denial , and I cannot live like this . Baby , please . Tracy , listen . I 'm sorry , all right ? I won 't do it anymore . Move . Just please stop . Honey , please , I 'm right here . Move . Move ! What are you gonna do ? You gonna run me over ? The girls are right there ! Huh ? What are you doing ? What are you doing ? You 're overreacting a little bit . Don 't you think you 're ... What are you doing ? Hey , can I ride back there with you ? No ! Heather , you can 't . Close the window . Honey , why are you doing this ? You don 't have to do this . We can talk this out . I love you . Please . He loves you , Mom . Please , just get out of the truck . Honey ! Well , that 's real good , honey . In front of our kids , huh ? JACKSON : You 're lucky I have batteries and bulbs . LAURA : Here . " Yeah , Jackson , we 're going out to look for some whales . " Big , dumb , docile . " lt 'll be mellow . " If I had told you , you wouldn 't have believed me . No , and I wouldn 't have gone , either . God . Sit here . JACKSON : Light , please ? Yeah , yeah . Can you turn ... Yeah . I know , I am . The pulse torched the contacts . Freaking slag . The ignition wires are fused together . If I can separate them and jerry-rig something , I may be able to get her started , but there 's not much we can do until morning . ( WATER splashing ) 2 : 00 . Where ? Wait , no , no , no , sorry . Never mind . Oh . I 'm zonked . Jeez . We could ... We could sleep in shifts . We could . Kind of defeats the purpose , doesn 't it ? All in all , I 'm taking this pretty well . You coax me and my boat on a snipe hunt for a dinosaur , then you suggest we sleep in shifts . Hey . Ground rules . I know . I get it . " l just wanna be your friend . " That was a one-time thing . I was coming out of a divorce . Just a rebound . No problem . I can play that part . That thing was huge today . Four times bigger than the boat . If only you didn 't have to eat live food . What ? Nothing . I was just ... Nothing . Phil tells me you guys have a pet . Well , yeah . Yeah . I 'm really into animals . Biology 's my best subject . Me , too . But you haven 't taken it yet . Yeah . Yeah . Well , I just ... I meant that I 'm looking forward to it . You know , next year . When I 'm in your grade . Well , if you have any problems , just give me a call . Mr. Morasko 's a real tool . So , you think maybe I could come over to Phil 's later , see your new bud ? I 'm not so sure that 's a good idea . You know what our problem is ? Language . I mean , how many misunderstandings and fights and wars get started because human beings say the wrong thing at the wrong time ? You know ? Whereas animals , they can 't talk . Which means they can 't lie . They don 't play games . Sometimes I think my dog understands me better than my parents . My pet , Nimrod , he can be kind of jumpy . That 's okay . We don 't have to take him for a walk or anything . How about 5 : 00 ? I 'd like that . If I see anything , I 'm gonna pull , okay ? Like that . And you come up fast , you hear me ? I 'd like to have every possible second I could to avoid being eaten . Yeah , I know . All right ? Ready ? I 'm already shrinking . Don 't think too long . Okay . All clear ? All clear . Jackson . Jackson ! Get back in the boat . Get back in the boat ! Come on ! What ? Get back in the boat . What ? What ? Did you see it ? Did you see it ? Shoot , no . Sorry . God ! Sorry , I got scared . I got scared . You want the good news or the bad news ? Good news . I found the problem . Okay . Bad news ? I can 't fix it . The engine 's working , but the prop is busted . We sheared the key on the shaft . It has to be replaced . My hands are too big . Mine aren 't . You 're not going in there . Why not ? Because you 're a ... That 's what I thought . Okay . Line ? Line . Okay . Watching ? Watching . You got it ? Not yet . One more . You sure that ... Not tight yet . ( SHUSHlNG ) You got it ? All right , get in here . What ? What ? ( whispering ) It 's right under my feet . ( gasping ) Daughtery . Daughtery ! Throw me the ... Throw me the ... No . The GPS ! GPS ! No ! Do it ! ( LOW growling ) ( ROCK music playing ON STEREO ) Well , I sure like what you got done with the place here . So , Tracy sent me out to check up on you . Should I just tell her you 're losing your grip ? You know , I ain 't saying you ain 't had no problem . They used to say to us in high school before the game , " Going gets tough ... " " The tough get going . " Well , that 's some dumb ass thing . Yeah , it sure did fire us up , though , didn 't it ? You mind if I ask you one question ? What makes you so special ? Huh ? Well , what makes you so special that you get to talk to your dead brother and no one else gets to ? You know , I miss my grandmother , but I don 't get to talk to her none . I don 't expect you to understand . Well , now , that you got right , boy . 'Cause you got a family and they love you . Them two baby girls , they need you , boy . You got a choice you gotta make , bud . I ... I gotta go back . I 'd like to be on record as saying this is a bad idea . One of your worst . Here 's a little something in case that big son of a bitch shows up . miles : There 's just a few basic rules . Don 't look at it straight in its eyes . Don 't get too close to the edge . And ... Calm down . And ... Well , you don 't happen to have any battery-operated devices on you , do you ? Just Kutcher . Go , Kutch ! Oh , we should probably put her on a leash . Oh , I don 't believe in that . Okay . Sure . Oh , yeah , and don 't ... Don 't bare your teeth . No smiling ? Not at him . ( NlM SQUAWKlNG ) He sounds feisty . You 'll protect me ? Absolutely . I just wanted to say , I think it 's really cool that you trust me enough to bring me here . Not a lot of guys would 've done that . You 're welcome . I think openness is very attractive . Is something wrong ? No , no , no . I brushed , I swear . It 's okay . I 'm sorry , guys . I can 't do this . Oh , you really think she liked you ? Her last boyfriend was in college . But really , I 'm glad you brushed . AMBER : Can we get out of here now ? Our work is done . ( KUTCHER barking ) Kutch ! Here , Kutchy ! Kutchy-koo ! Let 's go ! Talk to me , George . I 'm here . Right where it happened . Listen , if there 's something that you 're trying to tell me or something I need to know , then just come on with it . Please , just tell me something . All right , George , here I am . Now , you gotta tell me what you want me to do . All right ? You gotta tell me what you want me to do . LAURA : Where 's the signal ? Where 'd it go ? Damn emi filter . Well , you said it was working , right ? Will you shut up ? Sorry . I 've got a six-channel chipset , a cigarette adapter from a ' 93 Saab and a very rich yacht owner who 's gonna be pissed when he goes looking for his nav screen . Look , there it is . There it is . It 's about 200 miles offshore . We 're getting longitude and latitude . Signal active at 30-second intervals , and I 'm recording . My God . What ? It traveled 80 miles in a half an hour . Stabilizing our feed . ( exclaims ) Locked in . Long as your tag battery lasts , I think we got him . God . Do you know what this means ? We can track its feeding patterns , dive time , range , lung capacity . Thank you . Hey , Richie . Here we go . Did you get it figured out ? Yeah , I think I did . Well , I went back out to the rig . It was the last place I saw him alive . And got back in the water and asked George what he wanted from me . Know what he said ? He said , " What the hell you doing in the Gulf of Mexico ? " You know , they 're asking the same question . Well , I 'm gonna leave you to it . Welcome back . Thank you , Bug . TRACY : Hello ? Baby ? Yeah . Hey , it 's me . What 's going on ? ( BOTH chuckling ) Yeah , I 'm back . Mmm-hmm . Back to being me . Well , I just needed to get a little air , you know ? Just went out . On the boat . Yeah . Baby , I gotta call you back .

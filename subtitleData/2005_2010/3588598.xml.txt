 You know , after last year 's corporate , my wife was always encouraging me . A virus , a selective virus . Release it near the aliens . They can take the sneakers you are wearing off you . They take whatever you have on you . Your cell phone or anything . After that they kill you . You just put your scrawl there . - Fuck off ! No it 's not my house . I don 't live here . What is eviction ? You put the money here first . You don 't get anything until you pay . What are you trying to do ? I 'll chop your balls off . Some of the guns are small but if it shoot you , it make a big mess . No , not them ! Look - I find some ! I tell you before ... this is human technology , it is useless . Only our technology contains the fluid . This is not our technology ? - No , it 's junk . Keep looking . I find something . Yes . This is what we need . Good , little one . Get down ! Careful ... wait ... Why must it take so long ? Because it is very difficult so much can go wrong . Twenty years of work . Our plan is ready now ? - Quiet ... listen they are coming . You must hide this . They must not find it . Answer the door and be polite . No ! You take it . This place is swarming with MNU . I will be searched . I must get back to my son . Don 't make them angry - be polite ! Hello ? We would like you to ... - Nobody is here . Do you understand it ? - No . Look , I fix it . I make it work . I told you not to touch that . What is wrong ? Nothing . Go outside and watch for humans . Where is your friend ? He 's gone . Inside , go ! I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . What do you want ? We 're from MNU . - I know . - Why am I being evicted ? - Yes , it 's an eviction notice . - Yes ! - Christopher Johnson ? So , put your name in the bottom . It says you must give me 24 hours notice . This isn 't legal . - Sign the fokkin ' paper ! - No ! You keep away from my child ! It 's a silver cylinder . I can 't find it . We must find it . It contains the fluid . It 's not here . It has to be . Keep looking . We trade for ten thousand cans . Give them one hundred cans . - Hundred . - One hundred ! Yes , yes , but we take them all now . Alright , boys ! Get them the catfood - hurry up . Fuck off ! Go ! Hey friend , not you . You stay here . - What do you want from me ? - I just want to talk . Talk about what ? Stupid prawn . They 'll believe anything . I pay you next week , I promise . No money - you get nothing . Fucking prawn , this isn 't charity . What do you want ? - You have to go . - Please , I need your help . Please , just go . Leave us alone . I remember you . - Nothing . You must hide somewhere else . Only one thing that could make that happen ... Quick ! We have to hide him . Now you ... get down there . Where 's the fluid ? What did you do with it ? - Please ! - You took it I know you did . I can see what 's happening to you . Tell me where it is . Yes , that 's it . Yes ! - You ruined everything . - Where is this ? Fuel goes in here . That 's enough ! Quiet ! Then we fly away . I said quiet ! We cannot trust him . Never mind . Too bad . I could 've fixed you . Forget it . It doesn 't matter , it 's too late . We have medical machines on the mothership that can fix you . Yes . We can use this ship to fly up there . I don 't have fluid . I could fix you and I could fly away . But I don 't have fluid . It took twenty years to collect that amount . Yes . We are the same . There is a way out of this . We get the fluid back from MNU . The transformation is accelerating . You don 't have much time . How many moons does our planet have ? Seven . This planet only has one . I can 't wait to see our planet . It 's bigger than this one , isn 't it ? Enough . We go home now ? Not home . No . This is where we must go . See that tent there ? That might be ours . I want to go home ! We can 't go home . Not anymore . We go up to the mothership . You said it was a suicide mission . Maybe you were right . We have no weapons . They 'll shoot us on sight . I want the arm . Cut it off . I thought you said not to kill them ? What is this place ? - Don 't worry about that . What do they do in here ? I thought you had a way out ? - Where are you going ? - Follow me ! What are you doing ? - Making a bomb . Let 's go ! Go ! Drive ! Go down and initiate the binary commands . - To do what ? - The fixing . To fix me . It 's going to take a bit longer than I thought . Three years . Yes . Three years . I will fix you , but first I must save my people . I will not let my people be medical experiments ! I must go home and get help . I must use all the fluid to travel quickly . - Father ? - No , no , no . Father . Father ! My son ! My son 's in there ! Are you hurt ? No , we stick together . I 'm not leaving you here . Three years . I promise . We go home now ? Yes . I know it 's true .

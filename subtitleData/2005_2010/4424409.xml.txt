 Previously on " Defying Gravity " - What are you doing ? You try to find the problem and I 'll try to find your sex drive . Do you have any- - ? I 've had a vasectomy . According to your chart you did , but not according to your scan . ( Whispers ) Thank god I 'm not pregnant . Oh , no , no. you are pregnant . You 're just not gonna have a baby . Look , I know of a guy . He 's a doctor . Check ... ( Woman ) Donner ? Check . Do you copy ? Launch now , Donner ! ( Ted ) Donner , my man , this had better be a joke . Talk to me . Donner , do you copy ? Sharon ? ( Mouths words ) It knows . Beta knows . We need you to visit pod 4 , honey . ( Ted ) When were you gonna tell everybody else ? 43 days - when you get to Venus . ( Donner ) ' P.N.R. - - 'point of no return . 'It sounds simple . 'You step across the line , 'and you focus only on the way ahead . 'No going back . 'Sounds like a good way to live life- - 'look only ahead ... 'put the bad stuff behind you and move on . 'But that 's impossible . 'Your past always finds you . . . ' ( Zoe ) Donner ? 'Even when you think you 've let it go . ' Everything OK ? Yeah . During the days of the Roman republic , crossing the Rubicon River with an army was considered an act of war . ( Beeping ) In 49 B.C. , Julius Caesar ignored that law . He made the choice to cross the river , leading to civil war , the end of the republic and his own deification . I 'd say Caesar won . Thank you , Nadia . Gracias . Once we pass our own Rubicon point , we 'll no longer be able to do a direct abort and return quickly to earth . This is our last chance to take a shortcut home instead of having to go all the way around Venus , and we 're pretty far away from home right now , almost 30 million kilometres . Do you see earth way out to the left at about 11 : 00 ? Very soon it will look like just another star in the night sky . I really think we should tell them about Beta now . I know this group , they need some time to process . There are larger issues at play here . This call 's not up to you , it 's not even up to me . But I don 't want to lie to them . This isn 't about what any of us want . This is about what we have to do . ( Sighs ) Ted . Roger that . Good night . ( Ted ) Donner and Nadia , we need a nominal for every system before we can pass Rubicon tonight at 19 : 00 . About 30 systems are coming up as off-nominal . Probably just needs a reboot , but you get to check it anyway . Lucky us . And we will be assembling a time capsule . Oh , you gotta be kidding me . Time capsule ? On our last mission to Mars , at Rubicon , Goss had each of us pick an object , something personal . And we put them all in a time capsule and we left it behind . We have to leave something ? I don 't think I have anything I can get rid of . Just put a pair of your undies in , Morales . That is not funny . Well , it 's a little funny . Everything I have is important to me . It 's supposed to be important to you , Morales . That 's why you 're leaving it behind . You know , Mars mission 's not exactly a time in my life I 'm looking to relive . Well , this time capsule isn 't about Mars , Donner , it 's about unity . It 's about mutual sacrifice . Anything that brings us closer will make it easier to deal with challenges down the line . OK , and you believe that ? Yes , I do . Well , I didn 't bring anything to put in it . ( Scoffs ) Oh , yes , you did . This is Rufus . OK . What 's a rufus ? It 's our space baby- - or at least , he will be . Right now it 's a 21-day-old rabbit embryo . Rufus , say hello to your dad . ( Clears throat , lowers voice ) Jen , what are you doing ? You know you 're not supposed to keep those embryos past a couple of days . It 's just with this one . Jen , you cannot have a full-grown rabbit on the ship . You know you 're gonna have to kill it- - I know . I know . I-I just ... I wanted to keep one for a little while . I mean , aren 't you a little bit happy ? Babies are supposed to make everyone happy . It 's a 21-day-old rabbit embryo . It 's not a baby . Uh , OK . You know what ? Um , I never showed him to you . Jen . No , it 's fine . It 's fine . I 'm fine . I just- - Forget I even brought it up . Bye , babe . Storage bay 7 pressurization system ? Rebooting . Pressurization system is now nominal . Everything should be that easy . Uh , accelerometer assembly system ? ( Beep ) Nominal . Microwave scan beam ? ( Beep ) Nominal . OK . Uh , how about I take the ones over here and you take the ones over there ? The brayton turbines ? Why is this a problem for you ? The brayton turbines ? Before we left , things were good . I think they 're still good . I think we 're gonna be a go . Not this . This . I liked being friends with benefits . Why are things different up here than they were down there ? Because they just are . Is this about Zoe ? No . ( Scoffs ) no . Because it was about Zoe last time . This has nothing to do with Zoe . Look , we 're not training anymore . I don 't want to complicate this mission . This mission ? This is about Sharon . It was ten years ago , Donner . Let it go . ( Nadia ) Is it weird for you ? A lot of things are weird for me . What 'd you have in mind ? Goss ranking everyone who might get to go on the mission . A.S.C.A.N.S and instructors . Uh-huh . You nervous ? I don 't get nervous . Confident . I like that . How about a wager ? I 'm ranked higher than you , you sleep with me . If you are ranked higher than me , I 'll sleep with you . Uh , I don 't date astronauts . Mm , you should reconsider . Yeah ? I have a lot to offer . Like what ? One , no emotional attachment . Uh-huh . Two , no expectations . I don 't care if we have a future . I don 't care if you call me the next day . And I really don 't care if you ever buy me dinner . But I like dinner . Don 't get too comfortable being on top , Schilling . I love being on top . Looks like I win . ( Lowered voice ) I vote my place . Damn it . I 'm not top eight . 28th ? Seriously ? 28th ? Four better than me . Dead last . Give me the belt . Yeah . Way to go , bud . Thanks . Don 't worry about it . It 's only the first one , right ? It 'll get better . And you have that thing to deal with . You know , the thing , the , um ... Extenuating circumstances . 28th is not extenuating circumstances . 28th is , um ... 28th is I 'm gonna end up teaching high school Geology . 12th and 13th ? It 's Goss . I stood on Mars . Excuse me ? I 'm just putting that out there , that I 've stood on Mars . I know . I was there . No , no , no . Let 's be clear . I was on Mars . He was on Mars . You were safe up on " Zeus " issuing commands . That 's cos I was the commander of the ship . You seriously expect me to believe that I 'm 12th ? I might have tolerated second because Ted Shaw is a hell of an astronaut , but 12th ? Donner , it 's just a preliminary- - I 've stood on Mars . You 're handicapping us because of something that happened five years ago that we were all responsible for . You 're right . I 'm what ? You 're right . I am handicapping you two . I don 't want you guys on this mission . In fact , I don 't want you anywhere near my ship . You got baggage , Donner . Baggage kills people . No . Thinking you 're infallible kills people that didn 't have to die . I knew exactly what I was doing , and I can live with that . Can you really ? Yeah , I can . Come on , dude . It 's not worth it . You got something else , Donner ? Come on . You have the 10-minute rule in Germany ? It 's awesome . If Donner isn 't here in two more minutes , we all get to leave . OK ... Oh , come on . Today we 're gonna be looking at Antares flight system . Except some idiot has posted the schematic for the lab module . Um ... ( sighs ) all right . Um , it 's gonna be a general overview today . Those of you who don 't wash out will have the privilege of learning all about it later . Wrong . That 's wrong . That 's wrong . That 's wrong . Wrong . Damn it . I 've just never done anything illegal , like ever . I follow rules . I am ... I 'm a rule follower . Well , uh , don 't worry . The market for keeping these things under wraps is pretty big . Tell me about the risks with the pill . Give me odds . Well , in clinical trials in Europe , one in a thousand women have difficulties . Those are pretty good odds . So that 's what I recommend to you . I , uh , I 'm not sure what I wanna do yet . Well , I understand . It 's a difficult decision . So I 'll leave you my card . If you decide that you want to move forward , then you give me a call . All right . OK . Good luck . ( Doorbell Rings ) Your father has left me . What ? Your father has left me . Dad has not left you . I should have seen this coming . Mercury was in retrograde when we got married . Mom , I don 't have time for the crazy thing you do every time dad goes on a dig , all right ? I 'm in the middle of training . Oh , it 's not just a dig . He left for good . See ? Here 's the note . Do you have anything to drink ? And since when did you start eating ice cream ? I 've always eaten ice cream . Not by the bucket and only when you have the flu . Maybe you could sneeze on your note-leaving father . Dad always leaves a note , he doesn 't believe in saying good-bye , and you are overreacting , like you always do . I 'm overreacting , because this time there 's someone else . Oh , there 's someone else . A field assistant not much older than you are . Huh . What are you gonna do ? I have no idea . Moving on to water filtration system . ( Beep ) How we doing ? ( Beep ) Off-nominal . Really ? Mm-hmm . It didn 't clear on reboot . Let me see that . ( Beep ) Huh . How long till Rubicon ? 4 hours , 17 minutes . OK . Keep going . ( Ted ) Any idea what 's going on ? Oh , it could be anything . The first four panels are nominal . If we can find it , it should be easy to fix . Rubicon 's in four hours . Roger that . All 's green and nominal . I 'll start down here . You OK ? You 're being quiet . You 're never quiet . Rollie and I kinda had a fight this morning . What ? You and Rollie never fight . It 's just ... His longest mission was 34 days , and I 'm facing six years , and he 's judging me . For what ? Nothing . It was nothing . It 's ... Cos he doesn 't understand what it 's like to be alone up here . You know , he doesn 't get it . ( Alert beeping ) I just want to see where you spend your time . Is that so bad ? I won 't even say I 'm your mother . You can introduce me as Bev Kennedy . It 'll be fun , like we 're friends . In fact , do that . Maybe I can meet a hot astronaut . Ew . Hi . I 'm Bev Kennedy , Zoe 's friend . Two gin martinis , very dry , three olives . You got it . And before you start , I don 't want to talk about your father or his stupid field assistant . I want to focus on you . Oh , let me do a reading . You just carry them around with you now ? Yeah . Mom , could you please put those away ? People I work with come in here . Well , it 's not like you ever tell me anything about your life . How else am I gonna know if you 're dating anyone ? I 'm not dating anyone . Well , why not ? You 're a lovely girl when you put make up on . Nice cards . My mother was raised by gypsies . She used to be fun . All they 'll tell you is that I am 28th in the programme , never gonna make the ship , and I should clearly just quit and get a research grant at some state university . Oh , don 't be ridiculous . At least go for an ivy league school . Do you even listen when I talk ? Why are you here ? To have a drink with my daughter . No , no , no . Why are you here here ? I just wanted- - Wanted to wreak havoc in my life like you always do when dad leaves ? Seriously , Bev , it 's enough . Ohh . The falling tower . Ohh . I 'm leaving . You 're making me dinner ? Yes , I am . Hi . Hey , brother . So have you thought about when you 're coming over ? I have not . Oh , you lie . OK . I 've thought about it a couple times . And ? Well , tempting as it might be , you 're still an astronaut . I don 't date astronauts . Technically , you don 't date astronauts anymore . Technically , that 's true . Technically , my top lock sticks , so you kind of have to jimmy the door a little and then pull ... . .hard. Lee , do we have access to the I.S.O. archives ? We have unrestricted access to pretty much everything . Listen , I want the Mars mission- - cockpit recordings , telemetrics , the works . Copy . ( Goss ) ' Calliope , this is Zeus . 'We 're showing that the dust is breaching your thruster controls . 'The storm 's on the rise . We 're losing your launch window . ( Donner ) ' Copy that , Zeus . Yeah , it 's looking bad down here . 'How far out are they ? 100 metres . We 're holding . ' The real feed never went to pixel . It was edited . The official statement says the transmission was cut off because of the storm . Well , obviously not . Turn up the volume on " b . " 'Just give ' em two minutes , Mike . You don 't have two minutes . 'Well , we 're gonna take our chances . Not on my watch . 'You will die . The mission will fail . 'I need that lander off the planet now , Donner . 'Open the damn valve . 'Donner , launch . ' They could have made it . 'Open the damn valve , Donner ! ' ( Electronic female voice ) 'Launch now . ' ( Donner ) ' Oh , forgive me . ' Who signed off on the editing and the press release ? Goss ? Yeah , it was Goss and someone else . We 've got two clearances here . The second one 's e-7 . What 's e-7 ? The national security council . ( Ted ) Everything OK ? Think we missed something ? Apparently not . Listen . Hypothetically , if somebody were to tell you that they 're having , uh , I don 't know , hallucinations or something , what do you do ? Hallucinations ? Yeah . Well , hypothetically , I 'd have to report them to mission control and recommend they have a serious psych evaluation and bar them from any E.V.A. activity or landings . OK . Good to know . Oh , that is classic . Excuse me ? Well , is that really all you have ? A bunch of religious crap ? Send it all into space . I wouldn 't expect you to understand . Well , I don 't know , Morales . I 'm just saying , your faith must be wavering if you need all that crap to prove it . Mm . Hey . Hi . You know , I was just thinking that , um , we never actually got to talk about your paper , so I wanted to let you know that the offer is still open , if you 're interested . Drink ? Cyanobacteria ? Come on . Tell me you 're at least a little tempted . It 's just ... ( sighs ) I-I can 't . OK . Um ... Can I ask why ? Well , it 's just that by " drink " I think you kind of mean " date " , and I kind of am seeing Ted now , and it 's just- - Ted 's a friend . When I say " drink " I really meant drink . Look , if I were ever to ask you out on a date , you would know . I 'm such an ass . I 'm so sorry , Rol . No . No , no , no , no . It 's all right . Maybe that didn 't come out right . You know what ? Let 's--let 's just start this again . I 'd like to ask you some questions about your paper on cyanobacteria . Can I buy you a drink ? Well , it just so happens , those are two of my favourite things . I 'll take a draft , Tommy . You 're Maddux Donner . Yes , I am . You left two people on Mars . That 's the one . My daughter 's in the space programme . She 's very smart . Zoe Barnes , do you know her ? Yes , I do . Are you Zoe 's mom ? Bev Barnes . Nice to meet ya . The next drink 's on me . Nice to meet you . Zoe didn 't even tell me that she met you . That 's what every guy wants to hear . Well , don 't take it personally . She never tells me anything . I 'm sure it would have shown up in her cards , but she never indulges me . Mm-hmm . Would you like me to read you ? Sure , if it doesn 't involve money or pain . Excellent . Zoe 's thinking about leaving the programme to look for a research grant at an ivy league school . Really ? Why ? I don 't know . Something about the number 28 and a ship . I think she 's being ridiculous . You got your question ? Yeah , go ahead . Cut . Ah , the Lover . Mm . Well , you have at least one very important love affair in your life , possibly two . It 's not clear . She really said she 's leaving , huh ? Well , she said she 's considering it . The fool with the star . Hmm . What 's that ? You 're a man haunted by your past . Not that that 's surprising , given your past . ( Cell phone rings ) My cheating husband . Excuse me . No , it 's just I 've always been so fascinated with marine life . And I see these pictures of what the great barrier reef looked like when it was still underwater . I can 't help but wonder ... If " the effects of global warming " were directly responsible for the death of cyanobacteria " and ultimately the death of the great barrier reef . " Wow . You really have read my paper . That 's impressive , sir . I also read your , um , follow-up , where you talk about the reintroduction of cyanobacteria into the rice paddies in Asia . Help promote the growth of rice and hopefully , uh , help alleviate the world food shortage . It 's very interesting . OK , um , I 'm slightly terrified right now , cos that 's bordering on stalker . But seriously , I mean , they 've been trying to put that into play for 50 years now . Yeah , well , I guess it 's just your dumb luck there 's someone else here who actually cares about what 's going on with the earth . We might be the only two . Hmm . Well , then here 's to you and me , baby . Hey , babe . Hi . Ready for dinner ? Hey , my man . Hey , brother . How you doing ? Thank you so much for the drink and the cyanobacteria . You 're welcome . Thoughts on cyanobacteria and the rice paddies in Asia ? Say nothing . I think she 's beautiful . Well , that 's not bad , but anyway , have a good night . You guys have a good dinner . Good night . Good night . Found this somewhere . Thank you . Actually , I was in the back of the class . I had to duck . Yeah , it got away from me . Sorry about that . Anger will do that , and frustration . Guilt . It 's not just a baseball , is it ? Mintz , don 't shrink me . I 'm just saying , if the story 's true , that 's a lot to carry around . What story is that ? Two astronauts are secretly dating . They go to a baseball game a couple nights before their Mars mission launch . He catches a home run ball and he gives it to her - her prized possession . She takes it to Mars , and she doesn 't make it back . From that moment on , he can 't put that ball down . Maybe I got it wrong . Yeah , you did . Sharon caught the ball , bare-handed . ( Knocks ) Mrs Lewis . Maddux . We agreed you wouldn 't come here again . I know we did . I 'm--I 'm , uh , I 'm sorry . It won 't happen again . Uh ... I have a confession to make . Um ... When we got back from Mars , I-I took this from , uh , your daughter 's things before they had a chance to pack ' em up and send ' em to you . I didn 't have any right to do that . I 'm sorry . This belongs to you , and , uh , I think ... I think you oughta have it . What makes you think that I would want that , Maddux ? I don 't know . It was Sharon 's , and , um ... I know it meant something to her . Well , it means nothing to me . Good night , Mrs Lewis . Where have you been ? Your father called . I 'm going to meet him on the dig . Uh-huh . What about " someone else " ? What ? Mother . OK , OK . I might have overreacted . You OK , Zoe ? You look a little lost . You sure you don 't want me to ... OK . OK ? Really ? OK as in yes ? Don 't make me say it again . I might come to my senses . So you 're pregnant . The hanged man told you that ? No . Your boobs are huge , two tubs of Rocky Road , and you haven 't had anything to drink since I got here . What are you gonna do ? I don 't know . This one is nominal , too . They 're all good . Well , that makes no sense . ( Sighs ) All right , let 's check ' em again . ( Exhales deeply ) Has it occurred to you that everything 's gone wrong with this mission ? Wrenches , filtration systems . Antares was in orbit for a year of testing before we left . Maybe it 's us . Yeah , well , maybe it is . I was kidding . Donner , we weren 't even supposed to be here dealing with this . We 're supposed to be on earth . You 're supposed to be irritating Goss , and I 'm supposed to be reading " Goodnight Moon " to my son and sleeping in bed with my wife . Everything has gone wrong with this mission from the start . And maybe it 's time we said enough is enough . Are you saying you don 't want to do the check ? You just want to turn the thing around and go home ? No . Well , it kind of sounds to me like that 's what you 're saying . Ted , what 's going on ? Do you know something I don 't know ? No , not a thing . Let 's just check ' em again . ( Knocks on door ) Wow . What are you doing here ? What 's this I hear about you leaving ? What ? Well , Bev tells me that you 're thinking about leaving the programme . Bev should not talk to strangers . I 'm not a stranger . Bev gave me a reading . She was actually kind of accurate . Perfect ( ! ) How do you even think about leaving ? I don 't think I 'm gonna have much choice in the matter . You did see I was 28th . Yeah . No , come on . That 's like a preliminary ranking . Yeah . You ever think about ... living a different life ? What do you mean ? Like what ? Like a regular job and a family . Yeah . Yeah . Someday . I mean , right now , more than anything , I just want to fly . Don 't you ? ( Whispers ) Yeah . Don 't leave . Why ? You 're gonna be a good astronaut . Good night , Donner . All right , what now , engineer ? Humour me a second . It 's number five . The instrument panel says it 's clean . Run a sample check . This is definitely off-nominal . Donner , you 're reaching . Let 'sjust run the sample . Look at the ph . The sensor must be out . Probably ruined the carbon scrubs . We would have been screwed . Yeah . And you know there 's no way to judge ph by just looking at something . Well , it 's just lucky then , I guess . ( Electronic Voice ) Message waiting . ( Beep ) Message waiting . 'Hey , Jenny . 'I guess you must be busy . 'I just wanted to say that I 'm ... 'I 'm sorry about this morning . 'And I don 't want to fight with you . 'No , I don 't get it . 'I just- - I just want to talk to you , 'let you explain it to me . 'In the meantime , um ... ( clears throat ) ' . .tell...Rufus that Daddy says hello 'and I wish I were there with both of you . ' Rubicon in five ... four ... three ... two ... one . # Scared of what I saw # Are you mad at all ? ( Rollie ) Godspeed , Antares . Godspeed . It doesn 't even look like earth anymore . Mike , I need to talk to you . I got a board dinner . I 've seen the Mars recordings , both of them . My clearance actually exceeds the N.S.C. Well , if you 've seen both recordings , then you know I did my duty as commander . I 've seen the whole file , Mike , including the telemetry . It shows that Lewis and Walker didn 't stop . And Donner and Shaw didn 't panic . You did . You 're out of line . We both know I 'm not . We both know I had a damn good reason for wanting them off that planet . I want you off their backs , Mike . And whatever personal animosity you have towards them ... ( let it go . ) ( Donner ) ' Passing the point of no return doesn 't just happen . 'It 's a choice that we make , a line we decide to cross . ' And then we live with the consequences . ' 'Eve , I don 't care what he says . 'There is no way he knew the ph was off in that tank . 'And he was talking about hallucinations earlier today . ' What did you tell him ? Nothing , which was the wrong thing to do , but I told him nothing . We 're all doing what 's necessary , Ted . Yeah , well , we 'll see what tomorrow brings . 'There are no promises of a positive outcome , 'no guarantees that , like Caesar , we 'll wind up with an empire . ' They feel a lot further away today than they did yesterday . Don 't they ? 'All we can really count on is that things will change 'and that we 'll have to live with the results . . . ' Hey , madman . You know , you got me thinking yesterday , and I realized that this time capsule is actually about being willing to let something go than having to . So you all get your stuff back . That 's not the way Goss did it . Do I look like Goss to you ? It 's a different mission . Remember that . 'And that 's the hard part - 'because we 're defined by our past . ' ( Gunfire ) ( Girl screams ) ( Explosions ) 'We can rethink our choices a million times ... ' . .but what we decide , we own . 'It becomes a part of who we are . 'And while we may be crossing the river ... ' . .our footprints will always remain on the other side . ' E-mail subtitling @ bbc.co.uk

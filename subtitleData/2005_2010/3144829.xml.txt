 NEXT Subtitle by Darkopal Ladies and gentlemen ! Please welcome the man who knows what you 're gonna do before you do it ! The amazing , Frank Cadillac ! This is for the world peace . Good evening . Welcome to the beautiful downtown Las Vegas . How many people are here from the orient ? Raise your hands . You , sir ... Where are you from ? No , wait , wait ... Don 't tell me . I 'm sensing , you must have soul . You 're a soul man . Why don 't you share with everyone where are you from ? - Korea . - How about that , folks ? May I assume this charming young lady is your daughter ? - She is my wife ! Well , of course she is ! What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas . - What 's your name ? - Yhun-Kihong . Yhun-Kihong . Would you be kind enough to join me up on the stage please ? Are you serious about this guy ? This is a joke ? Going behind some mimes and clowns while we 're in it ? Yhun-Kihong . What if I told you that that pretty necklace your wearing has a broken catch and on my count of three , will fall in your drink . Wouldn 't that be something ? Wouldn 't that just blow your mind ? - Yeah . - Yes . Wouldn 't it blow all your minds ! Three , two , one now . Somebody said " spooky " ? Wait a minute , look at your glass . Where did it go ? Yhun-Kihong , why don 't you look inside my pocket ? Reach in . Dig deep . Let 's have a big hand for Yhun-Kihong . Well ... that 's magic folks . And that 's why I 'm here . They probably seen a lot of those shows . Mentalists , magicians , illusionists ... It would be shocked to know that sometimes not often , but sometimes , it 's the real deal . Masquerading as an act hiding behind a few 50 dollar tricks hiding in a plain sight . Because if the magician doesn 't do that , the alternative is impossible for others to live with . Anyway . Wednesday nights The Back Page doesn 't pay very well . So I gamble . But I don 't play against other people , only against the house . So , no mega Jack Pots , no wash outs . The idea is to be unnoticed . That way I can keep coming back . I 'm not a God . I can 't see everyone 's future , only my own . And only within 2 minutes , except for when I saw her . But we 'll come back to that . There is no pattern to this guy , he is all over the map . He 's not counting , not enough the top of that deck . Wait a minute . Isn 't it that " Two Bit Magic Act " that called Back Page . - What 's his name ? - Cadillac . Yes , Frank Cadillac . Is he pulling tricks on us ? Is that legal ? He can 't trick the deck . I 'm telling you . That little prick knows what 's coming . If he 's really knocking a system why 's he not betting more . That 's gonna be my second question . Look at that . He is looking at us . It 's like he can hear us . - What table was that ? - 27 . It 's Roybal , send security to table 27 ! Coming right now ! Your bets please . Here is the thing about the future . Every time you look at it , it changes . Because you looked at it , and that changes everything else . Nine thousand and seventeen . Empty the drawer . Move ! Drop the gun , now ! Nine thousand and seventeen . Drop the gun , step back . Its his gun . He 's gonna shoot you people . Step back , we 'll decide this right now . What 's he doing ? Security the doors , elevators , escalators every way out of this damn place , now ! Clayman ! Seal off the Black Jack tables ! Sullivan , linkup with Roybal ! - We are on the floor ! On the floor ! - Bring the view of the cameras ! That way ! This way ! He 's right next to the ten dollars slots . Aisle 14 . There he is ! Behind you ! Your left . Turn around ! He 's right between you . He 's in the mensroom ! Near the Gameshot ! Gameshot ! Davis , where the hell is he ? Black t-shirt , straw hat , heading towards the entrance . Come on , let 's go . Call Vegas PD . He just stole a silver Charger , tag 585-G4S . - Drop the gun , step back ! - It 's his gun . He was in the top of gambling bureaux 's wish list about 2 months ago . And what he does has nothing to do with luck . It 's a definite ability . Look at him ! He knows exactly what to do not get caught . Can you explain that to me ? No , I can 't explain it , Callie , nor do I have the time . The Russian Federation has a 10 kiloton nuclear munition , unaccounted for ... - I understand that . - I 'm not sure you do . We need every agent available beating the street . That bomb was stolen 5 weeks ago . We have just been informed of it now . Which means it could be parked under this truck for all we know . I need actionable intelligence . Not paranormals and bullshit magicians . With all due respect sir , this bullshit magician achieved paranormal advanced awareness , it 's statistically impossible . You let me bring him in , and you get what you want . 5 days , Kelly . That 's it . Get me the head of casino security . - You Roybel ? - It 's Roybal . - Whatever . - Who are you ? Cavanaugh , take a walk . Hey , Roybal . This isn 't a pissing contest . Come on . What did you do ? You bought a new car ? - Stole it . - Oh , look it is . 20 minutes to walk 20 steps . Well , that 's what you get from two packs a day . I got you two sandwiches . Two sandwiches ? That 's plenty grand . Come on , take it . I love you . Oh , Jesus . How can I repay you ? Must be a big to drive this thing . Chief Roybal , Special Agent Ferris . I 'm sure Agent Cavanaugh has explained to you everything you say is has been concealed . You only admit it can be used against you . Do we understand each other ? Sure . - Tell me about Cris Johnson . - I don 't know who that is . How about Frank Cadillac ? You chased him in the casino tonight . - He stole a car from valet parking . - Yes , yes I know Cadillac . I thought he was cheating us at cards , the next thing I know he 's tackling some guy waving a gun . - The gun wasn 't his . The man he tackled was one of the two casino killings in Reno . He is in custody now . Come on , I 'll show you something . You remember this ? Oh , yeah , of course I do . We were saying that he was looking right at us . - How did you get this ? - Now think carefully . What were you talking about when he looked up ? We were saying if he has a system why wasn 't he betting more . You sure you weren 't doing or saying anything else ? Just going down and pick him up ... And right then ? That 's when he looked up ? Very specific . That 's what I said . He looked up . Really . So he doesn 't have to be there to do it . Once you entered his consciousness , he can pick it up . Is that to work the system ? Thank you . We 're finished . Done some good here , Mr. Roybal . None of these up for the discussion . As far as your concerned Cris Johnson never existed . That 's going to be difficult , considering a hundred cameras saw him at the casino . Don 't worry . The tapes have been destroyed . Hey ! Is she single ? Cris , you can keep stealing ' cars and have been chasin ' but that 's not a life . And you gotta forget this girl that you keep seeing in your head . No , I am not going anywhere until I meet her . What supposed she doesn 't show up ? She already did . At the diner . 10 min. after 8 . You 've got a couple of hours . How about a game of pool ? Allright , Irv . We 'll shoot some pool . We timed every hand in the Black Jack . The longest was 89 seconds and Jonhson pulled 6 cards 21 . So we know he can stay at least a minute and a half ahead . I had a text from a radio frequency spectrum analysis . He came up dry . He is not receiving any form of electronic help . At one point there was a 2 minutes and 16 seconds delay . He never backed . Just got up and walked away . Maybe 2.16 is too long and he can 't see that far . Narrows the window a little bit any way . We got him . Vegas PD got a lo-jack hit on the stolen vehicle . Listen . About that girl . When you looked at the clock , did you happen to see a calendar ? Because its could be 10 years from now she gets hungry . It 's gotta be soon . I never seen further ahead than two minutes . Except for her . And what do you think the reason is for that ? I don 't know . Maybe she doesn 't scare easy . Maybe she is the one . Well , when you get like this there is no talking to you . - She is almost here . - What happened to the diner ? Somebody else . A cop . A cop ? Well , then you gotta go . Wait , I wanna see how much she knows , what she wants from me . Cris Johnson . Still here huh ? Where else would I be ? Special Agent Ferris . Next time steal a car without lojack . Can we speak privately ? It 's ok , Irv , go ahead . Thanks . I 'm sure you know why I 'm here . Cause you 're the man who knows what I 'm going to do before I do it . Right ? The show , right . Right . I saw you there . - Wonderful . Do you like magic tricks ? - Yeah , yeah I do . Like your magic tricks , clairvoyance , whatever you callin ' it . Let 's talk something hard . A stolen nucleur munition has being smuggled into the U.S. and may - in fact - already be here . I want you to look ahead and tell me where it is gonna be deployed . I think you got the wrong guy . It 's a magic act . You gonna stick with that story . Because millions of lives are at risk and you could maybe prevent a major catastrophe . On a practical note . We are standing in front of a stolen vehicle and you are wanted for assault involving a weapon at the casino . That was an accident . He had a gun and he was going to shoot two people ... Yeah ? How did you know that ? No good deed goes unpunished , does it ? I can fix your legal problems but first you gotta step up otherwise your next magic show is gonna be in Fulsom State Prison . It 's ironic but people like you who try to help had been torturing me . In the full sense of the word since I was 3 years old . What do they call it ? Oh , yeah . Observed play therapy . Featuring a marathon 36 hours " can you guess the next flash card " game ? So , please , leave me alone and let me live some semblence of a normal life . I would love to indulge your feelings . But I 'm dealing with a slightly larger picture right now . Now you can exercise your responsibility to help your fellow men or I will exercise that responsibility for you . You 're right , I gotta go . He 's gone , right ? I missed him by seconds tonight . Excuse me honey , can you get off my car ? Yeah . Thank you . Jesus . - Sr. Roybel ? - It 's Roybal . Can I help you man ? I have a few questions if this is a good time ? Gaming Commission is after hours , you guys should be in a strip club , come on . What can you tell us about Cris Johnson ? I don 't know who your talking about . Let me rephrase the question . - Here you go , honey . - Thanks . Excuse me . Hello ! I noticed you 're alone too . Do you mind if I join you ? Actually I do . Sorry to bother you but I have a question about the coffee , the bean they use ... Isn 't that something you should probably ask your waitress ? Yes , it is . Excuse me , do you have a light ? I don 't smoke . - Here you go , honey . - Thanks . Please . Don 't . - Hi , Liz . - Did you follow me here Kendal ? No , no . I just thought we could talk . You know we got really nothing to talk about . And I told you that 3 weeks ago . Liz , come on . I had an off day , just give me another shot . It 's not gonna happen , OK ? So maybe you should just go . Do you know how hard it was to find you ? I was at your apartment , I tried the Starbox in Lexington , I was at the dry cleaner ... All I 'm asking for is a few minutes of your time , so we can work things out ! Ok , Jesus ! You 're stalking me now . Don 't ! Don 't say that , please . That 's a terrible thing to say ... Let go of me , Kendal . Look , I just ... I thought we can talk . You know , maybe we can take a drive and now your ruining it . Your hurting me . Kendal ? I think your having another off day . - Who the hell are you ? - I 'm her future . Really ? Hi , my name is Cris . You okay , Kendal ? The thing is I feel connected to you and I don 't know the reason why . Now listen . I think it 's only fair that you pay for the lady 's breakfast . What are you having ? Pecan pies are amazing . Excuse me . I can pay for my own breakfast . And you know what ? You two , work things out . Your hurting me . Kendal ? I think your having another off day . - Who the hell are you ? - I 'm her future . Really ? Incoming . - God damn it , Kendal ! - What ? Don 't point at me . This is your fault . Get out of here ! Will somebody please call the cops ? I 'm so sorry . Are you OK ? Let me help you . Come on , lets get you cleaned up . Come on . OK . - I 'm seeing some stars . - Yeah ? I am Liz . Cris . You must have a death wish getting involved in that . - Here . Just ... - OK . OK . Hold it there . - Feel a bit . - OK . - It well . - What well ? Your luck . It 's gonna change . What are you ? A leprechaun ? Do leprachaun 's get punched in the face or have their car stolen ? - Your car was stolen ? - Yeah . I 'm hoping they find it today . Supposed to be in Flagstaff . Hey , is this tooth loose here ? I don 't know . I don 't think so . It hurts . Listen , maybe I can give you a ride . - I 'm gonna go that way . - That would really be helpful , Liz . Thank you . - I do have to make a stop though . - It 's OK . And it may take a few hours , so cool with that ? Hey , look . If you 're uncomfortable with this all , I 'll take a bus . No , no , no . Its fine , its fine . You 're not a psycho . Right ? Because the first psycho vibrate you 're out of the car . - OK . Yes Ma 'am . - OK . Deal . Deal . It 's amazing . Wasn 't it ? I end up in a diner where you are and both heading in the same direction . I don 't know if I can call that amazing , but ... Destiny . That 's what it really is . OK . I 'm starting to get that psycho voice . Ah , no ... You don 't believe in destiny ? Well , even if it does exist , I don 't think I want to know . I mean if every move we make is pre-ordained and what is the point of that life is supposed to be a surprise ? Isn 't it ? It would be nice . Yeah . So he came in twice a day for a week at exactly 9 past 8 ? Yeah , he would stay a few minutes , have a martini and then he 'd go . Until today when he met that lady . Didn 't you find anything strange about that ? Not strange enough to call the police . We got a regular who counts the cornflakes in his bowel it has to be an even number . - Got any cameras ? - Inside ? No . Outside ? No . Did you noticed what kind of car he was driving maybe overhear where they were going ? I don 't know what car but they were heading up Flagstaff . - Flagstaff ? - That 's what they said . Got another regular . She 's always on a diet . Brings in a scale to weigh the salad dressing . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Guy knows we are after him , he still risks coming here . 8 or 9 . Twice a day . He didn 't know if it 's day or night , just the time . He was waiting for her . Allright . There is a traffic cam over there , the bank , 7-11 across the street . Run all the tapes . We will get lucky and catch them at the wide . Hey , remember Roybal , the casino chief ? He had his throat cut last night after getting a knee cap shot off . You 're telling me this now ? We just talked him about Johnson . - Hey , I just found out . - Allright . - Local weapon ? - Dead end . Forensic 's came up emtpy . Not a hair or a fibre . Somebody wants information . Now , next time anything happens relevant to Johnson , I want to know right away . - I don 't care if it 's a paper cut . - OK , boss . The head of casino security . What did you learn from him ? For a macho guy , he screams like a girl . He was questioned by federal agents , looking for Cris Jonhson . Yes ? He said they hadn 't found him yet . Do you believe this shit ? He can see things before they happen ? It makes no difference what I believe . Look , we spent two years setting this up . And that man out there is worried all this will be compromised by Johnson . We 're wasting our time looking for some magician . We are being paid to secure the operations , Jones not to hunt down some carnival barmy . Really ? Then why are the same authorities that are looking for us so interested in him ? Get rid of him . Do it now . Hi . We have a super reservation . I teach here once a week . The conditions are pretty lousy . But it 's in the Canyon . One of the eight wonders of the world . - Hi , Sam . - Hi , Liz . A couple hundred years ago this tribe was booming . Plenty of food and thriving culture . They should be better off but I guess this is just their destiny . I would like to meet their shaman . I read once that in the many North American tribes their shamans purpose wasn 't only healing . But they also claim their power to the atmosphere . To bring on or stop rain even know future advance . Do you think that 's possible ? I believe any thing is possible . Me too . - Whose birthday ? - One of my students . Hi . How is it going ? Hello , how is everybody ? Good ? That 's good . That , that was a lot good . But you messed up on the last part . On the last part , yeah . I thought you weren 't coming back til next monday . Well I 'm not , but it 's Jake 's birthday . How could I miss that ? Who is that man you 're with ? - Is he your boyfriend ? - No , no , he 's not my boyfriend . He 's just my friend . I think he likes you . Why did you say that ? Because he looks at you like my brother looks at his girlfriend . Hey , Jake . Do you want to see some magic ? I 'll show you something . Come here . I found this rock out in the Canyon . And I want you to hold it because it 's a magic rock . That 's right . Hold it really tight , keep squeezing . It 's magic . It won 't bite . Happy birthday . So you 're a magician ? Well . I have a small magic act back in Vegas . Frank Cadillac show . - I thought your name was Cris . - It is . Frank Cadillac is my stage name . How did you come up with that ? I picked two things I really like and I put them together . Frankenstein and Cadillacs . Your odd . Charming . But odd . Cease fire ! Get out of the range ! Nice . A little closed , huh ? OK . You were right about the traffic cam . We got a positive ID . I 'm sorry . Don 't be sorry . It 's OK . - Did I drop ? - Drop ? - Yeah . - Ah , no . - God ! It 's coming down so hard . - Yeah . I like rain . I like rain too . Do you know once , I think was in Denmark , it rained fish . Because the sun dehydrated the water . Took it out in the atmosphere . Rehydrated the fish eggs , and they hatched and rained fish . Is it truth ? Yes , in the clouds . True story . Happened 50 years ago . Just felt like sharing that way to you . The road washed out ahead . You can 't cross until morning . Not even if it rains like this . Spin around and go back about two miles , take your second left there will be a motel they called ... - Cliffhanger . Thanks . Right . Him right ? That 's it . There is no front plate , where is the other side ? I don 't have it . What was that at the front window ? Go back . Back , back . Back , there ! Zoom in . It 's a permit . Track it and find her . I 'll light a fire . Cris , one little problem . Oh , no , no , no , I 'm gonna sleep in the car . - Here . - Oh , thanks . Sure . Hey , did you hear the joke about the zen master who ordered a hot dog ? No . He said he would have one with everything . Good night . Good night . What we have ? They 're in the Cliffhanger Motel outside Flagstaff . We found an Arizona foreman who remembers the land cruiser . How did they do that ? The road was floaded and he was about to suggest a place to stay . - But Johnson already knew , right ? - Exactly . Callie , it just got worse . All right people , we got a nuclear alert . Code red . In the southern California region . L.A. to San Diego , 95 % certainly . Nuclear emergency search teams are on the way , but until they get here somebody please tell me what my agency , the FBI are doing about it ? Well , sir , two main suspects have been interrogated . Cars and primacies have been checked . We have opened up surveillance on 2 or 3 suspects but nothing actionable yet . All was that we are doing ? Waiting for something actionable ? There are 8 million lives that are precarious at best so I say we widen this net to slightly suspicious and get some decent Intel before this nuke blows up Los Angeles . Allright , Callie . What do you propose we do next ? I believe that the urgency of the situation ... We know where he is . Let my team pick him up . The FBI are mobilizing . Continue watching . - Did you have the image ? - Yes . He said they 're mobilising . Standard procedure when security is escalated . Tell him to wrap it up . They 'll lead us straight to Johnson . - Don 't lose sight of them . Understand ? - OK , certainly . You hungry ? There is a coffee shop down the road . I 'd rather eat here , if that 's OK . Sure . What ? There is an Italian painter named Carlatti . And he defined beauty . He said it was a summation of the parts working together in such a way that that nothing needed to be added . Taken away or altered . That 's you . You 're beautiful . That was incredible . What was ? This . Over here . This is a good stand , our position had a good view of the motel . We 'll put our removable area surveillance , this formation , over here and that turn off . A team with a parabolic step right here . That 's fine , but I also want mobile surveillance , get me 2 or 3 hummers . If they run on us , I wanna be flexible . Ferris . Call the local police in Flagstaff . Tell them patrol the outside perimeter . I want that area locked down . A body turned up at an apartment , in line of sight of my office ... A slit throat , like Roybal . Somebody trying to follow us to Johnson . Cris ? Yeah ? Maybe there is such a thing as destiny . Give her 40 seconds . So after two minutes , he just stop seeing what 's gonna happen ? Not sure , I hope so . - Elizabeth Cooper ? - Yeah . Federal Agent Ferris . - What is this about ? - I 'm gonna need a few minutes of your time . Yeah , OK . They are putting her in the car . - Silahýný býrak , geri çekil . - It 's his gun . He 's gonna shoot you people . This was 3 days ago ? He used you to get away from Las Vegas . You can be pretty sure , everything he told you is a lie . He 's delusional . A sociopath . Oh , my God . My God . Oh , shit ! Oh , shit ! Go back to the motel . Have a drink . Put one of these in his glass . It 'll take 5 minutes to put him to sleep , then we will come in and get him . Nobody is being hurt . But this is important , you need to do it at least 2 minutes after you get him out of the room . Why do you need me ? Why can 't you just get him ? Liz , as I understand that you work for a federal founding program teaching on a native reservation , is that true ? Yes , that 's true . Well , I think you 're here to help us . We are on the same team . Now they letting her go . - Thanks for the note . - Sure . - Get a nice walk ? - I did . You know , it 's really beautiful here . Ah ! I 'm ... I have a present for you . Ah , thanks . I need that . Yeah . Is something wrong ? Oh , no , no . I 'm fine . Now , why don 't you go wash up I 'm gonna make us breakfast . - OK . 45 seconds . 1 minute 30 . And that 's 2 . - Looks good . - You think so ? Thank you . Don 't drink that ! It 's drugged . Oh , God , I don 't know what I 'm doing ! I don 't know what I 'm doing . Some federal agent came up to me and said that you are a delusional sociopath . And they showed me this tape . So maybe you are but I don 't want to believe that . I don 't think I can believe that . They also said that if you run they will shoot you . So I should drug you instead . Even if what they said is true , I don 't want you to die . I don 't want you to die . Cris , is it true ? Oh , shit ! Give me broadband noise reduction , I don 't like to hearing this . Speak quietly and act normally . How long they have said this drugs will take ? About 5 minutes . - What is he doing ? - He 's drinking . Give it a minute . Got a clean shot ? Not yet . The man that in the casino would have killed two people . It happened , it just hadn 't happen yet . Oh , my God , you 're delusional . Fluffy cranberry or a stack of chocolate pancakes for the kids . Fluffy Cranberry or a stack of chocolate cheap pancakes for the kids in a ... Safe ? Who knows what 's safe ? I know a man dropped dead from looking at his wife . Safe ? Who knows what 's safe ? I know a man dropped dead from looking at his wife . You can 't get lost in the woods , if you never go in to the woods . You can 't get lost in the woods , if you never go in to the woods . Boy , you got an answer for everything . That 's right sir . You 'rr the only person authorised to do so . That 's right sir . You 're the only person authorised to do so . - How are you doing this ? - I have no idea how but I can . I was born with it . - This is some kind of a trick ? - You know we don 't have time for that . You said anything is possible . So , you see things before they happen . - You see the future ? - My future , when it affect me and only 2 minutes ahead . Excepting you . For some reason I saw you . For some reason I saw you . Far beyond anything I 've ever seen before and I don 't know why . What do you mean , you saw me ? You have been ... You have been doing that to me ? You know what I 'm gonna do and what I 'm gonna say that your just setting me up ? - No , I haven 't . I wanted to find you because I need to know why I was seeing you . Because I ... It was not a setup . What are they want from you ? They think I can help them in matters of a national security . I don 't understand if you can help them why don 't you ? Because I can 't . I can only give them 2 minutes ahead start and that 's if my life has personally involved . - But with me you can see further . - Yeah . But they don 't know that . There is almost 10.000 dollars in this envelope . They know about you . You need to get away from here . What time do you have ? - 9 to 10 . - Set your wacth 9 to 17 . Read this when I left , and wait exactly 45 seconds before you do what it says . I will take Ferris with me . I might be away a week or month but if you can wait , I 'll find you . Something 's wrong . - Don 't do it . - I already have . Go , get him ! Alive ! Lets go ! Son of a bitch ! Cris . Oh , shit ! Run ! Johnson ! You 're not gonna shoot . You gonna let me die ? Hey , I need some help ! Get him out of here . Let 's get him out of here . I got you . You allright ? You OK ? Open your eyes . Look at me . No good deed goes unpunished , does it ? - She got him . - Now what ? - Did you see her ? - She is in the front of me . Smoke ? Thanks for today . You didn 't left me to die . I appreciate . That was a really showed character . I know , I seem like a bad guy , and all of this but in the interest to preserving our freedom there are larger issues at play . - What about my freedom ? - With freedom comes responsibility . - I have rights . - This isn 't about you . This is about 8 million other people . If I do what you want , you will keep me in this chair forever . There is a nuclear bomb somewhere in Los Angeles . And every television station in the world will broadcast precise details of it 's detonation .

 If it pleases you , great Aphrodite , grant us a child . If it pleased her , you 'd be pregnant already . Well , maybe if you came to temple with me once in a while ... The Gods help those who help themselves . Okay . Why don 't you get your butt over here and help me , then ? Jammer and Tyrol tried to recruit me today . For the resistance ? I turned them down . Thank the Gods . There was a time when I would have done it in a heartbeat but ... I guess things change . How ? You . Still clear . Okay , let 's go . Let 's go . Let 's go . May the Gods forgive us . Let 's go . Let 's go . Jammer , let 's go . Reveille . Up all bunks ! I thought we left all that military crap aboard Galactica . You 're already late . Tyrol 's gonna kick your ass . Here . Do you , maybe , want to meet me at temple when you get off ? I don 't do temples . It would really mean a lot to me . I don 't need all the bells and whistles . I talk to the Gods in my own way . But I 'll be there in spirit . I 'll see you later tonight . Okay . Now go , go , go , go . Five more minutes . Five more minutes .

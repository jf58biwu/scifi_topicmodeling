 Where does it come from ? This quest , this need to solve life 's mysteries , when the simplest of questions can never be answered ? Why are we here ? What is the soul ? Why do we dream ? Perhaps we 'd be better off not looking at all . Not delving , not yearning . But that 's not human nature . Not the human heart . That is not why we are here . Yet , still we struggle to make a difference , to change the world , to dream of hope , never knowing for certain who we will meet along the way . Who among the world of strangers will hold our hand , touch our hearts , and share the pain of trying ? You don 't love him . Everything I 've done , I did for them . You should have taken the money . Why did you take that bullet ? You could have let it phase right through you . It 's okay . Go . Forget about me . Save Micah . Hit it ! You can get us out of here . You can walk us through this wall . I don 't know if I can . You got to do this . Harder ! Come on , guys . You can do this . Surveillance picked them up in the elevator . What does he want ? Molly . What am I thinking now , Parkman ? Your last thought . Lower your gun . Shoot me , and she dies . As long as she 's alive , my daughter will never be safe . None of them will . You 'll take the life of one little girl to save another ? If I have to . Taking her life would save thousands . And Thompson , did you save thousands of lives by killing him ? No , just my own ! Officer Parkman ? Molly ? You know this man ? I told you he was coming . He promised to keep me safe . That 's right . And nobody is gonna hurt you . Nakamura Hiro . Peter Petrelli . I challenge everyone here tonight to inspire by example , to fight the battle , no matter the cost . Because the world is sick . It 's spinning out of control . But we can heal it . Heidi and the boys should be landing in Nantucket any minute . Show the world exactly ... Chopper 's gonna meet us up on the roof in an hour . Thank you all very much . Thank you . What is it , Ma ? It 's Linderman . He 's dead . How ? Someone got to him in his office . He was murdered . This is a terrible tragedy , Nathan . Yes , it is . But it doesn 't change anything . The plan wasn 't just his . You know that , Congressman . Yeah . After the explosion , the city is gonna need me , Ma . America is gonna need me , the world . This changes nothing . 42 . Micah 's on this floor . You go . I 'm only gonna slow you down . I 'm not leaving you . You 'll die if I do . I can 't go with you , Niki . You need to do this alone . You have to find Micah . I can 't . You can . You are strong enough . You always have been . I 'm coming back for you . You stay right here . You understand me ? Linderman 's guards will be all over us if they find Thompson 's body . Maybe you should have thought of that before you shot him . It was self-defense . And Molly Walker ? What 's your excuse for nearly shooting her ? She 's dangerous . You 're gonna need to start trusting me , Dr. Suresh . Yes , because that 's worked out really well for me before . The organization I used to work for once stood for something . Now , it 's been corrupted . Used to work for ? The only thing that 's important to me now is protecting my family . I will never let Molly be used to hurt anyone . She can do good in this world . I don 't think you understand the true nature of this organization . And you don 't understand how important she is to me . Those are my antibodies that saved her . I 'm responsible for her life . Hey ! There 's something wrong with Molly . Hello ? Dad . Claire ? Where are you ? Still in New York . I 'm with Peter , but there 's a problem . Ted Sprague 's dead . Sylar killed him . Dad ? Put Peter on the phone , please . He wants to talk to you . Hello ? When you came into contact with Ted , you absorbed his power . That 's right . Well , now that Sylar 's absorbed it , too , I think you may be the only one who can stop him . Now all we have to do is find him . Any idea where we start ? There 's a tracking system here . We 're trying to fix it now . As soon as we do , we 'll find him . And if you don 't ? You just stay close to Claire 's phone , okay ? I 'll contact you the second we know a location . Whatever you do , you keep Claire safe . You understand ? Yeah . What are we doing here ? I actually believed you . You lied to me . You said you weren 't going to call him . I know , but think about it , Claire . We can 't do this alone . No , you think about it . We can 't trust him . Yes , we can trust him . Nathan has never let me down . Nathan doesn 't care about you . He doesn 't care about anyone . He doesn 't care about me , and I 'm his own daughter . We do not need him . Yes , we do . Why ? Because I 'm afraid ! Okay ? And I need my brother to help us . CLAIRE : You lied to me , Peter . I trusted you . What 's the emergency ? The bomb , it 's not me . It 's Sylar . Sylar ? He killed Ted Sprague , which means he 's radioactive . If he explodes ... Look ... I know that this is a lot to process , but it is real . I swear . And I don 't have a lot of time to find him . What do you want me to do ? I don 't know , just help me . Come here . Look , if what you 're saying 's real , then there 's no reason to involve Claire in this . It 's just too dangerous . No , she has to stay with me . She 's just a kid , Pete . If I find Sylar , and I 'm able to stop him , then she 's the only one who can stop me if something goes wrong . You 're gonna be fine . How do you know ? You told me you could regenerate , that you could survive . There 's nothing you can do to stop it , Peter . They 're all gonna die . What is it ? Claire was right about you . What are you talking about ? Claire ? Claire ? Peter ! Claire ! No ! No ! No ! No , no , no , this isn 't happening . How much longer before she 's up and running ? She 's not a machine . I just gave her the transfusion . It 'll take some time . Well , take too much time and the city will pay for it . Sylar 's out there . You mean the boogeyman ? Don 't try to get up . I can do it . I can tell you where he is . Okay , so how do we do this ? I just ... I think about him in my mind , then I point to him on the map , there . I need a pushpin . So you can find anyone in the world ? You just need to think about them ? Almost anyone . Almost ? There 's only one that I can 't . Who 's that ? Is it someone bad , Molly , like the boogeyman ? No . He 's a lot worse . And why don 't you want to find him ? 'Cause when I think about him , he can see me . Molly , can you think about Sylar , now ? He 's there . That 's the Lower East Side , somewhere around Reed Street . Isaac 's loft . Isaac Mendez , the painter ? Who ? I gotta call Peter . Why don 't you let me answer that for you ? Hello ? Claire ? No , this is her grandmother . Where is she ? Where she belongs , with her family . Dad ! I 'm her family . o , you 're the man we gave her to , to look after , to keep safe , a job you haven 't done particularly well . What are you gonna do with her ? Take her someplace far enough to keep her out of harm 's way . I suggest you do the same . There isn 't much time . Let me say goodbye to her . Dad . Claire , are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm just trying to get away from these people . No . No . You 're better off going with them . What ? She 's right . You shouldn 't be here , but as soon as you 're safe out of the city , you try and get away . Do you understand ? Yeah . I need to find Peter . Where is he ? I don 't know . They won 't tell me . That 's long enough , dear . Tell me you have a plan , Dad . I have a plan . I love you , Claire . I love you , too . We have a new priority . Peter Petrelli , we have to find him . What for ? We know where Sylar is . We can go after him . No , not without Petrelli . He 's the only one who can stop him . I 've come 3,000 miles . I left my pregnant wife at home . He 's a bad guy . I 'm a cop . I 'm going after him . Then he will kill you . Yeah , we 'll see . Here you are , sir . Thank you . Hi . Hi . I 'm Peter . I 'm your father 's new nurse . Yes , I 've heard . I 'm Simone Deveaux . Nice to meet you . Your mother seems to know my father somehow . Yeah , she 's ... She 's ... Sorry . Yeah , my mother , she 's full of surprises . I wanna thank you . I know it 's a real hard job . Dying 's hard . What I do , it 's just ... I 'm here to help . No , you 're a real hero to care for a perfect stranger like this . This may sound strange , but your father 's last few weeks , his death , it could be beautiful if you let it be . Sure , piece of cake . I 'm not saying it 's not tragic for you . I 'm just saying ... You know , death is the one thing that connects us all , reminds us that what 's really important is who we 've touched , and you know , how much we 've given . It makes us realize that we have to be good to one another . See , your father , he 's the real hero , not me . Come on , I 'll show you the apartment , get you settled in . Believe me , if he knew , you 'd know . There 's a look you just can 't hide when it first shows . What about Nathan ? Linderman tells me Nathan will be ready to play his part . Well , he 's been wrong before . Meaning what , exactly ? I think that Linderman is betting on the wrong brother . We talking about the same Peter , here ? I look in Peter 's eyes , I see compassion , empathy , but , most of all , I see hope . This war won 't be saved on strength . What it really needs is heart , and that 's Peter . Charles , don 't get me wrong . I love Peter , but that poor kid can barely get out of his own way . He 's ruled by insecurities . He 's weak . No , trust me , this bomb is going to go off , and Nathan is going to be the one the world turns to . I don 't believe this tragedy 's inevitable . Well , then , one of us is going to be right and one of us won 't . Well , I 'm glad I won 't be alive to see which one that is . You are in my prayers , Charles . I could use them . Goodbye , my dear , dear friend . I know you 're there , Peter . Looks like you dropped something . Comic book that predicts the future . What will they think of next ? You 're kidding ? This is how Isaac thought I 'd die , stabbed by a silly little man ? Hiro is not silly . You should have seen the look on his face when he tried to kill me . You cannot take my brain . Please , what would I want with your brain ? Where is Peter Petrelli ? I don 't know . Where is he ? Let him go . I don 't think I 'm going to . Hiro . All you have to do is stop time before I cut off his head . Do you think you can do your little trick before I can do mine ? Micah ! Where are you ? Micah ! How ... You can 't be here . Look what you did . Oh , my God . Micah . It 's all your fault , Niki . D.L. , now Micah . They 're both gone , because you were weak . Micah , please . The wrong sister died . It should have been you . Face it , Niki , you 're nothing . I 'm the one they needed . Molly , we need to go , now . Where are we going ? Officer Parkman called . He believes that Sylar ... He believes the boogeyman is on his way . No , he 's not on his way . He 's already here . I have to get some paperwork . I 'm not going to be coming back to my office . Helicopter 's picking us up from the roof in 10 minutes . When the jet lands tomorrow morning , you 'll be safe . But everyone else will be dead . How can you do nothing to stop this ? It 's inevitable , dear . There 's nothing anyone can do about it . That 's insane ! Nothing is inevitable . The future is not written in stone . I 'm afraid this one is . If everything is so inevitable , then why has she been trying to keep us apart all these years ? There are things you simply aren 't mature enough to understand yet . Yeah , like how you can let your own son die like this . Your own brother ! He 's not gonna die . Thanks to you , Peter has the ability to survive . So he lives and kills millions of people . How can you let him be responsible for something like that ? And how can you live with yourself if he is ? Claire , I know that it 's hard for you to trust me right now , but this is all gonna make sense very soon . I promise . We 're offering you everything you 've ever wanted , Claire , a place to belong , a family . I already have a family . No ! I know what you 're thinking , Nathan . Let her go . You understand . How many times have I saved your ass ? I 'm the only reason that you 're still alive . Niki , that 's not me . Stop her . Find Micah . What ? I said , stop her . That 's not me . I 'm not strong enough . Who the hell are you talking to ? Mom ? Micah ? Mom , I 'm in here ! It 's locked . Mom ! Is it really you ? It 's me , baby . It 's just me . Wait ! He could be a bad guy . He needs my help . Okay , we need to get him out of here . It 's not working . They must have shut it down . Okay , I need a lookout . Can you do that ? Stand over here and keep an eye out . If anyone comes , tell me straightaway . Hiro ! Invisibility , always thought that that would be a good one to have . I don 't understand . How is this happening ? You 're alive . Is this a dream ? Am I time traveling ? Are you doing this ? Doesn 't really matter what it is , does it ? Only that you 're here , now . Yeah , but I saw you speaking to my mother . You know about the bomb . You know about everything . You came here because you needed to . You needed to hear the truth before you could save the world . Can I save the world ? You 've had the power all along , Peter . You just needed to learn how to use it . Why me ? Because there has to be one that 's good , there always has , and your heart has the ability to love , unconditionally . Like I told you , in the end , all that really matters is love . I 'm tired now . Let 's get you your rest , then , sir . Call me Charles . Peter . Peter ! Wake up ! Wake up . I must have blacked out . How did you find me ? I told you , we have a tracking system . And where 's Claire ? She 's safe . She 's with your mother . My mother ? Yeah . They 're on their way out of the city right now . Okay . Then you need to leave , too . I don 't think I can control this . No . I 'm staying with you . You saved my daughter 's life . I told you I owed you for that . Consider this payback . Yeah , but if I can 't stop Sylar , if I lose it , I could ... I will put you down myself . Don 't worry . I 'm a pretty good shot . Thank you , Mr. Bennet . Call me Noah . Come on . The guards are coming ! Dad ! Micah ? We have to go . It won 't work . Yes , it will . Come on , D.L. Come on ! Dad , hurry ! You know , it doesn 't look like there 's many places to hide . Are you sure about this tracking system ? He 's here . Don 't worry . All right . Look , all right , then that means he 's hiding in plain sight . What took you so long ? Haven 't I killed you before ? Didn 't take . You think I 'm gonna let you ruin it all , take all the glory ? Come on , let 's go . Did you really think you could stop me ? Mom , Dad needs your help ! Go back to your family . I got this . Wait . No ! No ! Turns out you 're the villain , Peter . I 'm the hero . Sylar ! You ? Hiro ! Peter Petrelli ! You can stop this . How ? I need you to kill me . Do it ! Do it ! You 're the only one , Claire . Tell me there 's another way , please . Shoot me . There is no other way . Yes , there is , Claire . The future isn 't written in stone . I took his power , Nathan . I can 't control it . I can 't do anything . I 'm not leaving you , Peter . There 's another way to end this and you know it . I can 't let you die . And I can 't let everyone else . You saved the cheerleader so we could save the world . I love you , Nathan . I love you , too . You ready ? What happened to them ? Wait ! Please don 't die , Officer Parkman . You 're my hero . We dream of hope . We dream of change , of fire , of love , of death . And then it happens . The dream becomes real . Let 's go . And the answer to this quest , this need to solve life 's mysteries finally shows itself , like the glowing light of the new dawn . Let 's go home . Home where ? Our house burnt down . Home is anywhere our family is together . You 've got a plan , right ? So much struggle for meaning , for purpose , and in the end , we find it only in each other , our shared experience of the fantastic and the mundane . The simple human need to find a kindred , to connect , and to know in our hearts that we are not alone . Ando must have thought I would give up . He took a sword and went after Sylar ! Alone ! He 'll die ! Yes . Probably . But that 's not your concern right now . You must remember your mission . The world is at stake . No , I must go after him . I will not abandon my friend ! Then you have already lost . Father . My whole life you have looked at me with disappointment . I do not wish to lose you now . But I cannot let my friend die . Not when I have the power to stop it . Don 't forget your legacy ... the wind at the back of history . It 's okay . I 'm here to save you . Don 't worry about me ! Just stab him ! Hiro ! You did it ! You were faster than Sylar ! Now I 'll go back . We can go back together . Surprise him ! No , Ando . This part of my journey ... I must finish alone . But ... I am not afraid . I know . You have shown me what bravery is . Your whole life you talked about your favourite stories ... Star Wars , Star Trek , Superman , Kensei ... All the heroes you wanted to be . One day , people will tell the story of ... Hiro Nakamura . So you 'll know I 'll be back . But ... your sword ? " It is not the sword . It is the man . " This man is ready . You look bad ass .

 NATHAN : Previously on Heroes . You stuck your nose where it didn 't belong ! ( SCREAMS ) So did you . HIRO : You stole something from me . You mean this ? Why are you doing this ? I work for a guy . I find stuff , he pays me . Where 's Kaito 's part of the formula ? The formula is gone . Stolen . Someone is manipulating us . Someone powerful . And they must be stopped . I will find them and stop them . Actually , you 're the only one who can . Cheerleader sleepover retreat ? What was that all about ? That was about buying some time . ANGELA : Meet your new partner . Am I being replaced ? Just until I find his weakness . And then I 'm gonna kill him . I 've dreamt the future , Gabriel . I 've seen how important you are . But only if you can master your urges . My ability is not just understanding how things work . There 's a hunger . I couldn 't control it and it turned me into a killer . You have it now . What did you do to me ? DNA manipulation . TRACY : I 've hurt people . You need to take it away . I can 't . You 're just gonna have to trust me , Nathan . You must help her . NATHAN : It 's all happening so fast . My life is a speeding train , and I 'm not sure where it 's headed . But one thing is certain . I have been given a second chance , touched by God , and I have got to believe that he has a purpose for my life . So why am I filled with self-doubt ? Plagued by demons , real and imaginary . Frightened by the challenges ahead , and haunted by the ghosts of my past . Does God know what I am ? Do I ? Am I an angel or a monster ? A hero or a villain ? And why can 't I see the difference ? Did I startle you ? Drink ? That 's right , because you 're not really here , are you ? Whatever makes you happy , Nathan . You know what would make me happy ? Some straight answers . Like how you knew she was in trouble . You mean Tracy ? You said she needed my help . That she was my path . Next thing I know , she 's taking a header into the Potomac . And you were there to save her . Now , I suppose you 're wondering why . I mean , was it luck ? Was it coincidence ? Or perhaps guidance from a higher power ? You 're not a messenger from God . Moses saw a burning bush . Mary heard the angel . God came to Samuel in his dreams . And I 've got a dead mobster telling me he 's the voice of God . You think the answers to your questions are somehow outside of you , Nathan , but God resides within . The answers will come . TRACY : Nathan ? Who are you talking to ? Nobody . Just clearing my head . ( CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO ) Yo , what up ? What do you need ? What 've you got ? White Lightning . Base . Angel dust ... I need something to take the edge off . All right , I got just the thing . I don 't need your drugs . I need you . You have the hunger . You 're just like me . I will never let myself become you . You already are , Brother . No . ( NECK SNAPPING ) I can 't be you . Peter , stop . You don 't know what you 're ... You don 't know what you 're doing . I know exactly what I 'm doing . When were you gonna tell me that Sylar is my brother ? What other secrets are you hiding from me , Mother ? Tell me your secrets ! Or I 'll rip open your head and I 'll take them out myself . ( WHIMPERING ) No . ( SCREAMING IN AGONY ) ( EXCLAIMING ) ( GROANS ) ( GASPS ) Are you okay ? Is he gonna be all right ? Yes . I 'll make sure of it . We got a lead on a new target . You want me to come with you ? Don 't make this harder than it already is . God . Oh , God . Sandra ? Crap ! What 's going on ? Claire lied . There was no cheerleader retreat . Now she 's not answering her cell . I 'm so dang stupid . She 's obviously gone after one of them . That 's all she 's been talking about . Wanting to help . No thanks to you . Okay , calm down . How can I be calm ? Look at them , they 're monsters . Claire can 't get hurt , remember ? Oh , no ? How about this guy ? Stephen Canfield . He creates vortexes , makes people disappear . Forever . Even Claire . All right , we 'll find her . ( SIGHING ) Oh , no . What is it , Meredith ? We just better hope it 's not him . Why ? Who is he ? His name 's Eric Doyle . He 's a horrible man . You don 't even want to know . You know , his place isn 't too far from here . I 'm gonna start by looking for her there . I 'm coming with you . Sandra . She 's my daughter . Can you do this ? I 'll have Claire home before you know it . You think I wanted to leave my family ? I had no choice . Just tell me where they are . You 're her sister , damn it . You know where she is . I got the right to see her and my kids . ( HANGS UP ) ( GRUNTS ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Hello ? Is there someone there ? Behind you . ( TASER GUN FIRES ) ( GROANING ) Gotcha . ( CHOKING ) I need your help . My help ? You buried me alive . Why in bloody hell would I help you ? ( BANGING ) Let me out of here , you sod off little Japanese cretin ! ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( BANGING CONTINUES ) I will give you another chance if you behave . Okay ? ( SIGHING ) Okay . We are searching for a formula that ... ( CHUCKLES ) Formula ? I knew it would come back to bite them in the ass some day . Even I told them to destroy it . So , you know who would steal it ? Maybe . If I tell you , what 's in it for me ? When we finish our mission , I promise to put you in a more spacious cell . With a window . And a bed . Forget it . Okay , back you go . Wait . You little Japanese Nazi . Let me think . Just off the top of my head , I 'd say your villain is Angela Petrelli . She asked us to find the formula . I see . Well , I 'm fresh out of ideas . Fine . Wait , I know how to find your big villain and get you your formula . I have a plan . ( EXCLAIMS ) How do you feel about recruiting ? Recruiting for what ? An organization for a new world order . Daphne , you and I are standing on the precipice for real change . A world where people like you are embraced , your gifts acknowledged and respected , not ignored . I mean , you 'd like to be part of a world where you can really be somebody , wouldn 't you ? So long as I get paid . What do I have to do ? LINDERMAN : There are others like you out there . Just invite them to join us . Everything you need to know is right here . These are some pretty nasty people . I don 't like getting my hands dirty . They 've merely lost their way . It 's time for us to give them purpose . ( POP SONG PLAYING ON RADIO ) ( SLOW SONG PLAYING ON RADIO ) Just sit . Just so you know , this was her idea , not mine . You mean , my mother ? If it was up to me , I 'd have left you to rot . ( SCOFFS ) No forgiveness , is that it ? You terrorized my daughter . You killed countless others , including a target that had valuable information ... Rehabilitation doesn 't happen overnight . I am trying . I understand . Killing is just in your nature . ( GROANING ) What 's going on ? What do you think ? I 'm bringing you back to Level 5 where you belong . Please , don 't do this . ( EXHALES ) I need to find my family . From the looks of things , they 're long gone . What do you expect ? The Company dragged me away in the middle of the night . I didn 't even get to say goodbye . They put me away for almost two years . My family must think I abandoned them . That 's what happens to people like you . They put you away so the rest of us can be safe . I made one mistake . But you 're like the others . So quick to judge , you want to believe I 'm a monster . You killed someone . You are a monster . You 're wrong , and you need to listen . ( DOOR CLOSING ) MAYA : Mohinder ? Hey , there . You didn 't come home last night . What 's this ? A flier . It was stuck in your door . Did you know your neighbor was missing ? I 'm getting closer , you know . This next stage in my research , it could be the answer to taking away your ability . ( WHISPERING ) I can make you happy , Maya . I should let you get back to it . Your Company has got it all wrong . I never meant to hurt anyone . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Who is this ? Your partner ? I don 't have a partner . What are you talking about ? " One of us , one of them , " right ? Company policy . You 're not with the Company , are you ? Are you with them ? Who the hell are you ? You come in here , shoot me , hold me hostage . You know about me ? I read your file . You killed a man . That was an accident . Your neighbor , right ? Over what ? A broken lawn mower ? We got into an argument . It got heated , I overreacted . Next thing I knew , he was gone . I didn 't want to hurt him . They locked me away . No lawyer , no trial . I love my wife . I love my children . I just want to see them again . Hold them . Even if it 's for the last time . I just want to be normal . You don 't understand . Now , just go . You 're letting me go ? Yeah . Just give me a head start before you call your friends at the Company . Maybe I can help . You tried to kill yourself . How do I know you 're not gonna do it again ? What do you want from me , Nathan ? Undying gratitude ? Thanks , you 're my hero . I want to know what you were doing on that bridge . I can 't talk about it . Why not ? Who 's gonna understand better than I am ? Just tell me . What happened ? I killed someone . Who ? A reporter . He threatened to run a story saying that I was Niki Sanders . When there was no way that I could reason with him , I got angry , I reached out to grab him , froze him . He shattered . It was an accident , Tracy . I need to turn myself in . That 's probably not a good idea . What are you gonna tell them , Tracy ? Who 's gonna believe you ? I can fly , but I can 't talk about it . Well , then I 'll show them . You can 't do that . Listen , I 've been there . I understand , I ... I wanted to tell the world , I even called a press conference . What happened ? I got shot . I died . And then I saw God . And I truly believe with all my heart that he 's got a higher purpose for us . You think God gave us these powers ? If he didn 't , who did ? A doctor in Reseda , California . This is the last number the Company has for them . It 's the same area code so they can 't have gone far . Thanks , Claire . For everything . Hi , baby . It 's me . Wait , don 't hang up . Look . I know you 're scared but I love you . I need to see you and the kids . Well , then meet me , anywhere . The Griffith Park carousel . ( PHONE DISCONNECTS ) Great . I can 't wait ... Hello ? Hello ? What happened ? We were cut off . ( DOOR BANGS OPEN ) ( GUN COCKS ) Claire ? Dad ? He 's your father ? You set me up . No , I swear . Back off , drop the gun . Let go of the girl . Sylar . Dad , what is he doing here ? Let her go , Canfield . You don 't stand a chance . Stand back . Last warning . I didn 't know . I 'm sorry . It 's not over yet . Hold onto something . GABRIEL : Stand back . I will shoot ! ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) MR. BENNET : Hold on , Claire . Dad , I can 't . Claire , hold on ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Dad ! Dad , help ! ( CREAKING ) Claire , don 't let go ! Dad ! ( GRUNTS ) ( SIGHS IN RELIEF ) You okay ? Peachy . Thank God . You okay ? The target 's gone . He can 't be far . Claire , where did Mr. Canfield go ? Leave him alone . He doesn 't want to hurt anyone . This isn 't a game , he 's very dangerous . Who are you to talk ? Bringing him here ? Tell me you 're not working with him after what he did to me . Claire , you hate me , I understand . When I touched your hand , I could feel the pain that I caused you , and I never meant ... Shut your mouth , now . You don 't get to talk to her , ever . Look . We 'll talk more about this when we get home , but right now , you have to tell me where Mr. Canfield went . He 's not a killer . He 's having problems like I had problems . He just ... He didn 't have you to help him . All right . Okay , then just let me talk to him . If what you say is true , we 'll make other arrangements . You can trust me , Claire . I wouldn 't send anybody to Level 5 that doesn 't belong there . He 's at the Griffith Park carousel . ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) This is your plan ? Go to a bar ? I haven 't had a drink in months , and they make a mean Appletini . I 'm warning you , Adam Monroe , I 'll pop you right back into your coffin . Relax . You said the Speedster girl was hired , right ? Well , this bar is the go-to destination of specials-for-hire . Specials-for-hire ? That 's right . Oh , like the Cantina . I never knew there was such a place . Can we find out who hired the Speedster ? Hello , that 's why we 're here . Just leave everything to me . And try and look tough . ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Barkeep . The usual , and make it snappy . Hello , Milosh . How dare you come in here ? Look , I didn 't know she was your wife , and for the record , she never mentioned it . ( EXCLAIMING ) ( PEOPLE EXCLAIMING ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SIGHS ) ( DOOR OPENING ) NATHAN : What happened to Peter ? I put him in a medically-induced coma . What ? Your brother tried to kill me . Why ? He took Sylar 's ability , and now he 's suffering the consequences . We 're in a lot of trouble , Nathan . Mom , that 's Tracy Strauss . Tracy , my mom . I know who she is , and why she 's come . I heard you saw Dr. Zimmerman . How do you know Dr. Zimmerman ? He worked for the Company many years ago in research and development . Very bright . Then you understand what he did to me ? You can help me . No , I 'm afraid that 's not possible . His work was classified . You want me to go public with this ? What are you hiding , Mom ? Zimmerman was instrumental in the Company 's development of synthetic abilities . Synthetic ? We used the technology on a number of infants . You were one of them , Tracy . As were your sisters , Niki and Barbara . And you , Nathan , we gave you your ability , too . ( GASPS ) My God . What have you done ? ( GASPING ) My God . I got to get you out . ( DOOR CLOSING ) ( CLATTERING ) ( GROANING ) Maya . I know you 're in here . ( CLATTERING ) You have to control your power . You don 't want to be a killer again , do you ? ( EXHALES ) What have you done ? You 're a monster . I wish you hadn 't said that . ( MAYA GASPS ) ( HIRO SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( ANDO SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( CHUCKLES ) ( GROANS ) It 's done . What do you want me to do about the two Japanese guys ? It 's all here . The testing , the experimentation . Everything they did to us . It wasn 't God . We were trying to be better than God . How ? By using people as lab rats ? Your own son ? Your father was disappointed that you weren 't born with the genetic code , but we thought , because of your lineage , your system could handle it . And obviously we were right . Then what about me ? My parents were dead . I had no one to protect me . Tracy , what this Company did to you in the name of science was wrong . We know that now . And that is why we divided the formula and hid it , so this would never happen again . An innocent man is dead because of what you did to me . Then help me , because someone has stolen the formula . They want to restart this project . They want to create a world filled with dangerous people . Deadly , out of control . They will destroy everything . Please help me stop them . Go to hell . Nathan , it 's why Peter took Sylar 's ability . It 's why he sacrificed himself . He knows what 's gonna happen to this world . You do not understand . I understand , Ma . I understand . You locked Peter up , put a shunt in his head . You did experiments on me and God knows who else . Peter ? Claire ? Who else did you use as your own personal guinea pig ? Nathan , listen to me . Nathan . I 'm sorry . What 's next ? I know a scientist . He understands all of this genetic stuff . If anybody can help you , he can . Can he be trusted ? Suresh ? Yeah , he 's harmless . Stephen , it 's Claire . I talked to my dad . He said he 's willing to listen . It doesn 't matter anymore . What happened ? They never showed up . You were right , Claire . My wife , my kids , they 're afraid of me . Maybe I am a monster . Couldn 't put it better . Dad , what are you doing ? It 's all right . We 're just talking . I 'll make you a deal , Stephen . My partner is standing right over there by my car . You make him disappear , and this is all over . I don 't understand , you want me to kill your partner ? ( INAUDIBLE ) Do it , and I 'll let you go . I give you my word . What are you saying ? You do not have to do this . Stay out of this , Claire . She 's right , I can 't . I 'm not a killer . Maybe not , but he is , and he needs to be destroyed . Unfortunately , I can 't do it . Please ... I 'm not asking . Dad , no . I 'm doing this for us , Claire . For what Sylar did to you . You people , you 've taken everything from me . Do it . Kill him , now . What are you doing ? I won 't be a monster . No . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( EXHALES ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Hello , boys . Nemesis . So , my friend here tells me that you 're looking for work . And I said , " That 's not possible . Those goody two-shoes ? " We heard about what you are doing . Sign us up . I 'm not convinced . We have changed . We are badasses now . Yes , we are very badass . When do we start ? Not so fast . You have to prove yourself worthy . How do we do that ? You 're the one with the powers ? Yes . I control time and space . Cool . Kill the other one . Kill Ando ? Kill Ando ? Yeah , he has no powers . What good is he to us ? You kill him , you are badass . I 'm sorry , my friend . I must make some sacrifices to save the world . ( GROANING ) ( DAPHNE GASPING ) Hiro . We 'll talk more when I come home , okay ? Claire , wait . I know you 're disappointed , but I did what I had to do . For us . She doesn 't believe a word you 're saying . She knows exactly what you did back there . Why you didn 't take down Stephen Canfield when you had the chance . Nobody 's talking to you . Claire finally sees you for what you are . A user . Isn 't that right , Claire ? You used her to try to find that poor man , then you used him to try to kill me , because to you I 'm nothing but a monster . He doesn 't see our humanity , Claire . He never will . Wait . You 're not gonna listen to him , are you ? The man is a deranged sociopath . He 's a killer . He 's a monster . Yes . And you 're my daughter . And everything I do is to protect you . To protect this family . Tell me you understand that . I understand . ( SIGHING ) It 's all gonna be okay . I promise . Mom . SANDRA : Claire . Thank God , I was so worried . Are you okay ? Because if you are , you 're so grounded . ( SIGHING ) I 'm sorry . I 'm just glad Meredith found you . Meredith ? ERIC : Enjoying your dinner , my dear ? Eat . ( SIGHS ) Now , give me a sweet kiss . Go to hell , you filthy ... ( MOANS ) ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) Oh , my God . ( GASPS ) Peter , tell me you didn 't do this , please . ( GASPS ) ( GASPING ) MAN : Hello , Angela . No , it can 't be . You can see the future . I can 't have that . That 's too dangerous . No , you won 't succeed . I 'll stop you . Don 't be ridiculous . You won 't even be able to move . ARTHUR : You won 't even be able to move . LINDERMAN : You 're late . Have you completed your task ? They 're on board . Even the Japanese guy . I 'm not happy about what happened . That 's not what I signed up for . I 'm not a killer . Well , it 's all part of making the world a better place , Daphne . No pain , no gain . There 's another one you 're going to have to recruit . I 'm afraid he 's going to be the most difficult . Matt Parkman ? What 's his thing ? He has the ability to alter your mind . Put thoughts into your head . Make you see things that aren 't there . Speaking of which , I finally figured out what 's been bugging me about you . I 'm fast . Real fast . I can sneak up on everybody . But I can 't sneak up on you . ( GASPS ) I knew it . You 're not really there . It 's not your concern , Daphne . Just bring me Parkman . I guess I don 't really have a choice , do I ? ( ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATOR PUMPING ) The team is coming together nicely . Everything went fine , perfect with Nathan . I messed with his head , gave him visions of Linderman , just like you asked . Now he thinks he 's doing God 's work . Yes . Very real . Daphne is spreading the word . We 're building an army just like you ... Sorry . Knox called just a few minutes ago . He 'll have Adam Monroe here by tomorrow . Right . Absolutely . Whatever you say goes , Mr. Petrelli .

I 've already read the suicide note.I- - but this is a note we found in your husband 's office . I really think you should read it . What is this ? Some kind of joke ? That would make you the punchline . Paul couldn 't have written this ! It looks like his handwriting . - It 's a lie . - Is it ? Hannah ?

I don 't have to listen to this ! told you he was getting back with Marika . tied his hands with a knot only a fisherman 's daughter would use . Now which part ? Which part is the lie ? and he threw it all away . And you overdosed your husband and forged his confession . isn 't it ? Paul figured it out . I had no choice . The way I felt about Matt ... you will never know that kind of love . I hope not . What are you doing ? I never said paul wrote the letter . I only said it looked like his handwriting .

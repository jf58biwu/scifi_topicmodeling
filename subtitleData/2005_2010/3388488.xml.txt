 Previously on the sarah connor chronicles ... You like me ? the loner weirdo ? That 's why I came up to you that day , john . I thought , since you 're a weirdo , You might get me . She 's a security risk . You understand that I 'm gonna keep seeing riley , Even if everyone thinks it 's a bad idea . You 're all crazy . It 's all gonna burn , And you 're gonna be nothing but bleached skulls ! You wanted to talk ? I don 't think I can do this anymore . What if I want out ? There is no out . We 're developing a human interactive a.i. Hello , mr. ellison . My name 's john henry . the a.i. needs to be trained . You taught it rules . But it 's got no ethics . What does this mean to you ? I keep seeing it in my dreams , john . It means something . It 's written in blood on my basement wall . Mom , you 're tired . You 've been sick . Chasing killer robots will do that to you . Tell me about the three dots . In 1490 , the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca , landed on the shore of this new world seeking power and fortune . He was immediately attacked and captured . Almost all of the travelling companions murdered . Enslaved , de Vaca chose to embrace these capturer 's beliefs and learn their ways . He became a healer . Over time he was freed . And de Vaca attracted his own following , who believed he had the power of life and death The desert had transformed him . He was not the first , and he would not be the last It 's like the world 's been pulled out from under my feet . I don 't know what 's real and what 's not . Eileen , what you 're describing Is common among experiencers such as yourself . When a person lives through something beyond human understanding , We experience fear . A loss of control . A sense of isolation . And a deep , almost existential loneliness . And you ... Miss fly on the wall . What brings you here today ? I 'm sarah . Hello , sarah. welcome . I came here today because there have been reports Of people seeing ufos with this mark . I need to find out what it means . It 's important to you . I 've been dreaming about it . I 'm having nightmares . Are they nightmares , or are they memories ? My son thinks them crazy . May not crazy , maybe that 's the wrong word . But he doubts me . He 's never doubted me before . If there 's one thing we understand here , it 's doubt . I have additional photos on my website . It 's an actual photo of California drones These alien 's spacecraft has been spotted , in various locations around the State . Alien , not military ? Definitely not military . The drone 's loitering capability Is far beyond anything our military has in its fleet . The predator , the reaper None of them has anywhere near the presence that the drones do . And the symbol ? Some witnesses have reported seeing The three dots on the hull of the spacecraft . The mark is also referred to in the Abraham blogs Abraham , claimed to be a scientist Working on a top-secret alien-centered project Being covered up by the authorities . The metal hyper-alloy that he was working with Exhibited a tensile strength far beyond our existing technology . Fire , explosions , extreme pressure . This metal could survive it all . It was basically indestructible . Abraham- - where do I find him ? Well , that 's the million-dollar question . I don 't know . No one knows . Abraham blogged a few times , Then he disappeared six months ago . Think someone killed him ? I know your type . Come out , watch the kooks . Have a good laugh at our expense . I 'm not laughing at anyone . Enjoy the rest of the freak show . interested in abraham ? Hello ? Hey , john ? Hey , you coming home ? No , I 've got a lead . I 'll be home late . From the flying saucer convention . The ufo experiencers , yes . There 's a blogger named abraham . He may have been working with endoskeleton metal . Oh , well , we all know how reliable bloggers are . Why do you have to be so sarcastic ? Mom ... Just be careful out there , okay ? And I thought my room was a disaster . Your room is a disaster . Berry bonanza or peachy keen ? This is a work in progress , all right ? It sure is something . You okay ? I 'm peachy keen . Why , do I not look peachy keen ? You 're smiling with your mouth , but not your eyes . You 're doing it right now . I flipped out at my foster mom . What do you mean , " flipped out " ? Two of the kids were fighting . And it kind of got to me . So I went on this little rant . About what ? They 're just so naive , you know ? They have no idea how good they have it . All they do is complain about every little thing , And everyone at school 's the exact same way . It 's like one big whine-athon . You 're so lucky your mom 's homeschooling you . Yeah , it 's been awesome . You didn 't buy me a smoothie . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know you were here . I 'm always here . Cameron . I 'm not sure we 're gonna have enough paint . Would you do me a favor and go out and get some ? You have 420 square feet to paint . What you have should be sufficient . Two coats . It 's a bigger job than it looks . I have a job too . Well , could you do it in the other room ? Please ? Peachy keen is my favorite . Come here . You 're a pretty girl . What 's your name ? Does abraham know we 're coming ? Abraham doesn 't live here . I do . But you said- - If you 're interested in abraham , You 'll wanna see this . Abraham 's a pseudonym . Alan park is his real name . Has a masters from m.i.t. Specialized in something called lidar . Light detection and ranging . If you know what it stands for , Then you know that lidar is an optical Remote sensing technology . Like radar . Except with light . Its main application is ... Robots . You say that like it 's a bad thing . All I can offer you is tea . You seem more like a coffee type . So I 've been told . Type " a . " Focused ... goal-oriented . And yet here I stand with a cup of chamomile tea . Can I ask you a personal question ? Could I stop you ? What are you doing out here ? In the desert . Looking for answers . About abraham ? Abraham , life . Whether the government is hiding little green men In fallout shelters . How to make the perfect cup of tea . You ? I haven 't figured out all my questions yet . Well , having a doubting thomas in the house can 't help . How ' bout you ? you got family ? Or is this a one-gal operation ? Just me , myself , and the coyotes . Solitude . I remember it fondly . Most of the time , I love it . Most of the time . These ... are drone sightings . And these ... Are sightings of abraham . This one 's the most recent . Then that 's where we 'll start . This room is so adorable . How could you not like it ? Because I 'm not eight . Plus , it 's my mom 's subconscious way Of trying to keep me a kid . The minute she took off , out came the paint brush . Where 'd she go ? You don 't wanna know . Yeah , I do , actually . Why ? Um , because she 's your mom , And I care about you . Hey , you got somethin ' . What happened to you ? Nothing . That 's a bruise . John , it 's nothing . Who did that to you ? John , please . Is that your foster dad ? No , it was no one , okay ? I 'll kick his ass . John , it wasn 't him , okay ? I swear . Just drop it , please . The answer 's still no . I can 't do what you 're asking . Shame . I thought a good night 's sleep Would change your mind . I didn 't sleep . John henry Needs someone to talk to , Now that dr. sherman is gone . Dr. sherman is gone Because he--it- - killed him . It wasn 't murder , mr. ellison . You said so yourself . You also said I was remiss in creating john henry Without teaching him right from wrong . This is our opportunity to correct that oversight . " our " opportunity ? Your religious faith and paternal instinct Make you the ideal candidate To foster his moral development . That thing killed 20 fbi agents . It needs a whole lot more than just a talking to . The program responsible for those murders is gone . The john henry program is no more responsible For the deaths of those fbi agents Than you or i . Many believe Tactile experience is integral to a.i. development . His body is merely a puppet . An interface . We control him . You control him . And when john henry completes ... His development ... When he realizes what his puppet is capable of ... Do you know how powerful he 'll be ? Cows are more powerful than man , mr. ellison . But I 'd still rather be the farmer with the rifle . Talk to john henry . Teach him right from wrong . You know , abraham was spotted here a week ago . By who ? I don 't know . It was an anonymous posting in a ufo chat room . Do you belong to many of the news groups ? I 'm not much for computers . Usually , they go hand in hand . Computers , technology , visitations . Not for me . I 'm only interested in the drones . In the markings. the ones that abraham saw . Everything comes back to abraham . I guess so . What are we doing here ? Right now , I 'm gonna go pee . Abraham . Where is he ? If you know , tell me now . I 'm abraham . I 'm the one you 're looking for . My real name is alan park . What else is real ? All of it . All of it ? The research , the blogs . It 's all true . Except the woman part . My life was in danger . I needed to hide . - From who ? - I don 't know . Not good enough . A few years after m.i.t. , I went to work for an aerospace firm . It was there that I was approached by a company That needed my expertise with lidar . The money was good . More than good. it was incredible . They gave us cars , company housing . What was the project ? Well , that 's the thing . I never knew . No one knew . We all signed n.d.a.s. Everybody worked in isolation . But we had access To technology and materials I 'd never seen . Was it military ? I started blogging . Asking if anyone recognized what I was working with . Strange things started to happen . My apartment was broken into , And then one day I was driving home from work And my brakes went out . The next morning , I went to the bank And withdrew all my savings . Went into hiding . Some disguise . I couldn 't take any risks . Took a risk with me . You know something about all of this that I don 't . I can tell . You have proof ? Can you prove anything you just told me ? I have a piece . The metal I was working with . I stole a piece before I left . Where is it ? In the storage facility . I rented it the day I disappeared . I 'll drive . It 's not safe . It never is . you all right ? It 's okay , if you 're not . I want you to tell me if you 're not . I 'm all right . Maybe this color red is too bright . Maybe the brown was better . The red 's perfect. you 're just not used to it . The lady in the store said I was an autumn . I 've never even seen autumn . Why did you pick me ? I always wanted to ask . But you never have . I thought you would tell me when the time was right . I think the time is right . No , sweetie . The time 's past . What happened to your face ? Nothing . How did you get hurt ? It was nothing . I smacked into a door . What part ? What ? Of the door . Oh , I don 't know . Just the door . I like your star . Excuse me ? Your tattoo. it 's tight . Thank you . I 'm thinking of getting one . Can I look at yours ? Did it hurt ? Not too much . You stuck needles into your skin . Needles can be painful . Hey ... what 's going on ? I 'm looking at her star . She 's thinking about getting one . A tattoo ? Of what ? A tiger or a wolf . I haven 't decided yet . We need to talk . I 'm cool. really . Talk . Missed you at choir practice . Don 't think my wife doesn 't notice When her best baritone is gone . I 'm sorry . Things have been crazy . Been going through a difficult time . We need to see more of you , not less . Do you remember I come from a big family ? Seven kids . Before lila and I got married , We used to talk long into the night About how many kids we were gonna have . Family 's a blessing . Yeah , she wanted three , maybe four . I was more in the four to five range . Sounds like there was room for compromise . Guess she wanted to wait Until she made it through quantico . I agreed . She graduated september 1 , 2001 . We started trying in earnest that very night . Ten days later . September 11th . She decided she didn 't want to get pregnant anymore . Understandable reaction . But she already was . I didn 't find out until after she had terminated it . Always wondered what happened Between you two . Yeah , that 's what happened . When you called today , you said you wanted guidance . Yeah , that 's true . This have something to do with lila ? No . Does it have something to do with the child ? The child ? Yes . Does this have something to do with the child ? I don 't know . I don 't know . It 's gone . I swear , it was here . Sarah , they must have broken in . Who are you ? - What do you want from me ? - The truth . I told you , I don 't know . The name on my paychecks led to a shell corporation . It 's all a dead end . You 're lying . No ! You 're a liar and a fake . You 're the fake ! You 're a mother . You 're a seeker . You 're a soldier . You 're everything . But you 're nothing . You don 't know anything about me . Oh , really ? I 'm a man who lives as woman , And you 're a woman who lives as a- - Stop . What made you so hard ? Who are you working for ? You almost got me killed . Tell me. tell me about the metal . About the symbols . The bullets . I could feel them. they were close . So close . We nearly died . You don 't feel it . Why don 't you feel it ? I don 't hate them , you know . They tried to kill you. twice . They did kill me . They killed Alan Park . And I thank them for it . They gave me a gift . The life I was scared to lead . Before this happened , I was a cog in the machine . Ordinary , repressed . How many people dare to live the life they dream of ? Face ... their real fears about who they really are ? Not their houses , or their jobs , or their habits , But their deepest , truest selves . Do you have any idea what I 'm talking about ? I used to be a waitress . They killed her too . Tell me about your lab. where is it ? They made sure we never knew . The company came and picked us up every morning . Drove us in a van with blacked-out windows To the facility . What is it ? There may be a way to help you remember . What are you doing here ? I 'm sorry , Jesse . No one 's following me . I double backed , like you taught me . Jesse , I 'm really sorry . Don 't get mad at me , please . Phones. that 's why we have phones . I just didn 't know where else to go . Yeah , well . Not here , sweetie . Any place but here . I got kicked out of my foster home . You did what ? I got kicked out . They threw me out , 'cause I hit Kay , my foster mom . I was just freaking out . You know , I started thinking about everything . What 's coming for all of us . For them . I just--i need someone to talk to . I need you . I was thinking that , Instead of just getting another foster home , That maybe we could find someplace close together . Like an apartment or something . I 'll just tell John that I quit school , and- - And we can be together . I 'm not here to babysit . And you 're not here to feel sorry for yourself . I 'm not your friend . I am not your mother . And you are here ... To keep John Connor away from her . Go finish your job . Go . She 's lying . About what ? I don 't know , but her pulse was elevated And her hand was perspiring . She 's lying . Yeah , her pulse was elevated Because you were freaking her out . As usual . What happened to her face ? I don 't know . She didn 't say . I can get her to tell me the truth . Stay away from her . Riley . Riley , answer me . Open it . Now . New memories can be confusing , The question Sally poses is very important . How soon do we tell a new person in our lives That we 've experienced an abduction ? - Dr. Morris ? - Sarah . We met at the UFO convention . I 'm busy at the moment , But if you 'd like to make an appointment . No appointment. it 's an emergency . No matter what happens , I 'm never going back to what I was . Good luck . Have a seat , please . Who taught you how to play chess ? I did . Did you play with dr. sherman ? No . We played other games . Talking games . Do you miss dr. sherman ? I 'm designed to learn . He helped me learn . His absence slows my growth . His absence ... Is more important than that . His value was more than just his function for you . Human beings aren 't like chess pieces . It matters if we live or die . Why does it matter ? All humans die eventually . Yes , that 's true . But our lives are- - are sacred . Do you know what sacred means ? Holy. worthy of respect . Venerable . Do you know why human life is sacred ? Because so few humans are alive Compared to the number that are dead ? No . Because we 're god 's creation . God made everything . The stars , the earth , Everything on this planet . We are all god 's children . Am I god 's child ? That 's one of the things we 're here to talk about . Checkmate . I win . Would you like to play again ? You body is completely relaxed . I 'm gonna count down from five , And when I reach one , you will be in the park You ready ? I 'm ready . 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 . Where are you ? What do you see ? I 'm waiting at the bench ... For five other people . We all live in town . We all climb inside the van . After a few miles , We come to a stop . There 's a sound . At the end of the dirt road is a warehouse . There 's an office in front . No windows . No way to see in or out . does that bother you ? no , I like not being seen . The van parks outside . The driver unlocks the door . We head inside . Can I help you ? Your body is completely relaxed , Your mind clear and open . I 'm gonna count down from five .

At the end of the dirt road is a warehouse . there 's an office in front . No windows , no way to see in or out . does that bother you ? no , I like not being seen . I don 't know who they are .

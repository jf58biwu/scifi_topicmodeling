 SHOWDOWN AT AREA 51 ( 2011 ) It 's the third time today . Where 's the epicenter ? A hundred and twenty miles northwest of the fault . The seismograph must be malfunctioning . No , it was serviced last week . Just keep an eye for me , Charlie . Uh , and call me if it gets worse . Where 're you going ? I 've got someone I gotta take care of . Sorry I 'm late . Shouldn 't you plug that thing in or something ? Hybrids are the way for the future , Jake . Well , If we believed everything that you read we would all be living on the moon and driving flying suitcases by now , wouldn 't we ? It 's all marketing , little brother . You and dad have been telling me that one since birth . Since I am the only one still on this side of reality , I figure I owe it to the old man to keep you grounded . Look , bro , it seems like the old family barbecue thing is a little stressful on you , so if you wanna just take a rain check this month it 's not a problem . I promised mom and dad we 'd do this . I 'm not gonna let them down . That is a lovely sentiment . However , I don 't really think that they can see us , so , you know , you can chill . You do Chinese takeout . I got some pizza pockets in the fridge right there . Chill . Yeah , that 's always been easy for you . Since you stood up to Tate , you 've become a freaking legend . Even in failure . You 're a success . Well , you 're the one with the big house and the weird car . All I 've got is my fat boy out there , a couple of sober memories with Monica , and my six pack . My three pack right now . About to be a two pack right now . She resigned last month . Said It was med leave . But I don 't think ... Mm-mh , buh , buh ... Let 's not bring up the past . I wanna do something on my own , you know . Something memorable . You 'll get there . I 'm all show . I wish mom and dad could see ya . Little G Q scientist . They 'd be really proud of you . You really think so ? I know so . Let me borrow 20 bucks . What ? What about 40 bucks ? Jackass . What the hell ? My God , they 're headed right for us . Call it . It 's a real deal . Black ten , black ten . We 've a security breach at S-4 . This is not a drill . Priority one . Priority one . Move . Move . Move , move . Take it up . Okay . I 'm getting old . Eight , eight , eight from the ranch . Oh . Pizza pockets for me . Gotta go . Lock up for me , will ya ? Right . Probably a bucket of nothing . Are you seeing what I 'm seeing ? Hostile . Sir , target is hostile . Target is hostile ! Where the hell is Alex ? Let 's go . Let 's go . C 'mon . Go , go go , go . Go , go , go . Ready , Captain . Ready , Captain . Ready . Ready , Captain . Ready , Captain . You will be fired upon . Hold your positions . This Is your final warning . Fire ! Medic ! This is Alpha One . We have sustained major casualties . I need immediate backup for my location . Let 's go , let 's go . Charlie ! We have two unidentifieds crash-land near by . One target is hostile . They took out the chopper . Hangar S-4 is under attack . Medivac units are already ... All right , calm down . Call Tate . Get Down here now . Do it ! Saddle up ! Let 's go ! Where is my Medivac ? My men are dying . I need backup . Where Is my Medlvac ? I need help now I What happened here ? Hands In the air ! Put your hands In the air now I. Pull back . Everyone out , now ! Argh ! Ah ! Welcome everyone to Eye Witness News . The news source In the region . The source for all of your news and entertainment . There are reports of a disturbance in the wildlife refuge . We take you live now to our correspondent standing by . Sources from the Department of Natural Resources say the explosion within the military wildlife refuge Is nothing to worry about . Plumes of black smoke can be seen as far as Jefferson County . So far , park rangers are not saying what caused the explosion , but they are admitting there may be a few fatalities . Alex . God ! What do you mean he 's not available ? This is Jake Townsend , his brother . Then let me talk to Charlie Weise . No , you can 't take a message ? What the hell is going on there ? Hello ? Fine . Have it your way , then . The public has the right to Information . There are children around here . You 've gotta give us something . Hands where I can see ' em I. Jake . Hey , Charlie . You got my message . You shouldn 't be here . Where 's Alex ? I can 't answer that . I don 't really care about the operation anymore . I just wanna know where my brother is , okay ? I got a bad feeling about this . You know I can 't disclose classified information to a civilian . Then let 's pretend I 'm still in the inside . I can 't do it . I 'm not going anywhere until somebody gives me some answers . Don 't put me in the position . Cuff him . Put him in the jeep . You can 't hold me down here without processing me with an attorney present . Shut up , Townsend . You 've no rights here . Not any more . I got it . Nice acting job , Brando . Two unidentifieds crashed in the park this morning . One confirmed hostile target . Then all hell broke loose at hangar S-4 . S-4 . Yeah . Sorry , uh , about the cuffs . Alex took a team to S-4 , and hasn 't reported back in , yet . It 's big , Jake . The pros are here . Tate . It 'll all be covered up by dawn . Right , right , right . I gotta go . For your brother . Target one appears to be heading west towards the town of Mercury . Satellite 's lost the second target . Assemble unlit to Intercept target one . We 'll pick ' em off one at a time . I want them both In a box by sundown . Yes , Sir . All right , men , let 's move it up . Mercury . Chop chop . Hello , M r . Townsend . Where is my brother ? How does that uniform feel ? Familiar yet out of reach ? You 're not only trespassing , but impersonating a federal officer . All I wanna now is where is Alex . The official story ? He 's on extended vacation . Fly fishing I think . Come on , Tate . Enough for the area 51 cover-up crap . I think you 've overhead too much as it is . Take this man in hold and have him sedated . The suits will want to debrief him . This isn 't the end of it . Sure it is , Jake . Get a jeep ! Pull it over , buddy . Oh , yeah ! Oh-ho , ho-ho . Thank you , Play Station . Jake Townsend has escaped . He 's about to cross the perimeter . Go find his ass , you pack of geniuses ! Let 's roll ! Oh-oh . Get out of the vehicle . Put the weapon down . What do you want ? I need your help . You speak English . I speak many languages . It is part of my training . You 've got a pretty bad Injury ... It Is not important . I need your help with something greater than I. Why me ? It seems that you are also in jeopardy . Perhaps we could help each other . Like what ? I must find the Omega seed . A large obelisk . What do you need that for ? At sundown tomorrow it will destroy the inhabitants of this planet unless it is deactivated with this . The Ether rod . Where you at S-4 ? Did you kill those guys ? No . There is another . Another , another what ? Another ... My navigation system was destroyed by an Omega centurion named Kronnan whose sole mission Is to see that the Omega seed detonates . Will you help me ? I think I know somebody that can help us . Get in . Oh , Yeah . I heard rumors of the Omega seed , but it was classified even for me . Look , she might be able to help us out but it could take some time . Tell her something . We have little hope . C 'mon . I don 't believe it . Monica . My mother said you 'd come crawling back eventually . But you should 've brought flowers . I brought him . Oh , my God . We need your help . Come in . You 're hurt . It is nothing . Let us help you . Come on . Men . I require N H4O H. Jake , hand me the ammonia . In the cabinet . Top shelf . The Omega seed is like a thermometer . It monitors the development of a planet until it is ripe . Ripe for what ? Harvesting . The Omega race relies on artificial waste products from civilized planets . Fossil fuels emissions , nuclear waste and alike . Why they don 't just ask for them ? We 'd be happy to get rid of it . They do not negotiate . They conquer . That is enough . So , what ? The obelisk sends out a signal when the planet 's ready and then they invade ? The obelisk will send off a signal but it will also detonate , releasing a pathogen into the atmosphere . Pathogen . Anything that breaths will be dead in 36 hours . How do we stop it ? The Ether rod . The Omega race designed them . It 's a safety switch to prevent a premature detonation . We managed to obtain several of them . However , this one fell into the hands of your race sixty years ago . Crashes of ' 47 . As your planet was recently targeted by the Omega race , I was sent to retrieve the Ether rod and deactivate the Omega seed . But It was not until recently when the seed began to activate that I was able to determine the rod 's true location . What about all the interest in area 51 ? Well , the government obviously leaked stories towards Mexico to keep the enthusiasts away from the real deal here in Missouri . Why don 't you just use another Ether rod ? Because each Omega seed has a specific Ether rod . A key to a deadly lock . This is the only one that can stop it . But without my navigation system , I am blind . I 've heard about a " Mythigalian " structure discovered underground in the ' 30s . The story goes the government covered up classifying lt , but I 've no idea where it is . The location of the seed is coded onto the Ether rod itself . So , you can speak English , and you can fly a spaceship but you can 't translate the Ether rod . My hard drive has been disabled . You might wanna think about night school . Look , I brought him here because I thought you might help us decode the glyphs . So , so now I 'm your go-to girl ? You wouldn 't let me study it before it was put in a classified storage . Then you vanished and I was stuck in a file room for two years . No calls , no emails . I was discharged . What ? I signed a release for you to have the Ether rod for study . And Tate got a hold of it and freaked . If I had talked to you about it , we 'd both been court marshaled . It was part of the agreement that you and I would never speak again . You protected me . Jake , I 'm ... I 'm sorry . There 's nothing to be sorry for . You have access to the Ether rod now . Can you decipher it ? Maybe . It 's gonna take some time . You must hurry . Alex is missing . What ? Zero contact . I 'm sure he 's just gone deep . You used to vanish too , remember ? I don 't know this time . He 'll turn up . Time Is running short . I 've almost got it . We 've got another 18 hours . Kronnan must have the location locked by now . He is coming . U h , not helping . Just let her work , okay ? So , uh , you got a name or ... Jude . I 'm Jake . So , where are you from ? Far away . You have family there ? I had a mate . Had ? Killed by Kronnan . Jude ! Jude ! Jude ! Jude ! What was her name ? Quintana . I 'm sorry . I lost my parents . I am sorry . I found it . It 's in Potosi . Go , go , go . Let 's go . Hands where I can see ' em . No . Nobody gets hurt . Your weapon , sir . Your weapon . Jake , you 're becoming quite a thorn . Don 't you know this thing Is dangerous ? He 's here to help , Tate . Oh , please . Humvee 's ready , Sir . Roger that . We 'll debrief there . But I want our visitor here shackled now . Remember these bad boys ? Unbreakable , my friend . What about the others ? I 'll take that . Monica . I told you she couldn 't be controlled . Screw you , Tate . I know the truth . She 's got a bigger mouth than yours , Jake . I know you 're here to contain alien activity . How many of these visitors have you exterminated ? Does he seem like a girl scout to you ? We 're cleaners , Monica . Mr. and Mrs. Muster sitting down on the prairie can 't handle the truth . They should thank me every day for keeping them safe in their towns of mediocre life . So just shut your damn mouth , all right ? All right , let 's move it out . Tate , I know how much you like to cover things up , but you have no idea how public this is gonna be . We 're talking global disaster . Well , good luck with that , M r . Conspiracy . Does he look like a conspiracy to you ? Who , E. T. ? Trust me , he 's going on a long vacation . You can 't shove the facts under the flag forever , Tate . It 's my job to interpret the facts , Jake , not yours . Oh , really ? Then what about Alex , huh ? Where were the facts whenever Alex disappeared ? You wanna know what happened to Alex ? I 'll tell you , Jake . He 's dead . Evaporated in that hangar along with everyone else thanks to this thing . Did you kill the men in the hangar ? Did you kill my brother ? Answer me ! That 's enough , Jake . That 's enough ! Kronnan . You need to leave now . We need you . Take It down I What the hell is that thing ? My problem . You have the Ether rod . Yes . Make sure he does not get it . What about you ? Let 's go . C 'mon . Not so fast , honey . God , I hate fighting women . You okay ? Yeah . You okay ? Yeah . It 's changing . It 's missing a gem . Maybe you shouldn 't use the alien space rod as a night lighter . Now I remember why we broke . Argh ! Wait , wait . We 're missing a gem . It will not function without all six gems . Are you sure ? Yes . Get in . C 'mon , c 'mon . C 'mon . I must have missed hot-wiring 101 . Let 's go back to my house . No , we can jack one of the Humvees . Sweet . Left your trail for us to see you , Little Red Riding Hood . And I , I am the big bad wolf . The Omega seed is located in Potosi . Fifty miles to the south . What about this missing stone ? The Ether rod Is useless without all six gems . We must hurry . Kronnan will attempt to stop us . What is he ? Part of him is what your technology has just begun to explore . Quantum physics . Nano machines , only refined far beyond your capabilities . But there is the other side . The side that most species I have seen share . Even yours . What 's that ? Biology . Protected by a sentient exoskeleton . He can be killed . I 've seen those weapons that you 've got . You don 't have something that can take him out ? This explosive device can level an entire building . It Is useless against his armour . Only the absence of his armour will open him to mortality . My hydrochloric acid sphere affected him , but it is not permanent . H is technology is simply too strong . That 's it . We just gotta find the right can opener . We have got to find the stone . It 's a classified location In Potosi . I 'm sending you the coordinates now . I want my team assembled the moment I get there . The missing gem Is closer . Turn down that road . Great . A junkyard . So what ? We 're just gonna wave the magic stick around until we hit pay dirt ? Have some faith , Monica . Right . We must hurry . N ice hang . Keep an eye out if there 's a couple of rabid Rottweilers around this place . Uh , yeah , nice car dog . Holy crap sticks . Joe ? Who 's asking ? I 'm Jake Townsend . We 're from the base . Yeah , well , he 's not from the base . No , no , he 's not . He 's not , but he 's here to help us . Help us with what ? Halloween ? I don 't need no help . I didn 't put up a sign or nothing . Isn 't that right , Sparky ? Look , Joe , have you ever heard of something called the Omega seed ? Omega . Omega . No . Omega vitamins maybe . My wife Ethel made me take them before she kicked five years ago . Yeah . Maybe she was the one who needed to take the vitamins . She would nag me day In and day out ... This is pointless . Yeah , look , Joe , we 're a little tight on time . We 're looking for the missing piece of a puzzle that could be lethal . It 's just a small gemstone about the size of a nickel . And ? And our friend is here to help . We were just hoping that you could help us locate lt . How do you know he 's not lying ? H is kind killed people back in the crashes of ' 47 . It was the Omega race , not us . Well , you learned how to talk . You ran off one of their ships before we shot you down . We were protecting you . The casualties were regrettable . You call straight from the barracks friendly fire ? You have few hours left . How do I know we can trust you ? Look , Joe , Joe . He 's here to help us . The aliens had shot down our back . We 've gotta stop them . Please . Yeah , alright . C 'mon . Captain Kirk stays outside . H is kind shot down over a dozen planes . Killed a lot of pilots . Are you sure it was his species ? Yes , damn it ! Never question a man who owns a junkyard . I 'm In touch with the past , like a 1 - 800 psychic . Look , let 's assume for the moment he 's telling the truth and the casualties were accidental . We 've seen Kronnan . The other one has killed dozens of people . Jude has done nothing but help us . Oh , you have no idea what he 's capable of . Believe me . I have seen it first hand when I was a boy . But that 's why I spent my life on that base doing my father 's work . See ? It 's missing a gem . Damn right it is . So , you know where it is ? Look , you don 't wanna bring those gems together . The thing lights up like a Christmas tree . It emanates some kind of radiation . We decided to remove one of the gems so we could figure out what It was . Then I took it with me when I retired as a safety measure . So you have it with you . No . I , uh , pawned it off to buy this place . You what ? Joe , the Ether rod can deactivate the Omega seed but it 's no good without all six gems . Well , maybe your friend outside is gonna use it as a triggering device to blow us all to smithereens . Have you ever thought about that ? How do you know you can trust this guy ? Have you had him over to your house for Thanksgiving dinner ? Did you find the gem ? It ain 't here . Kronnan . You have any weapons ? Are you kidding ? I may be smart but I 'm still a redneck . Here . I think we 're gonna need something with a little more kick . Think this will do ya ? I told ya . Wait ! No ! No , no , no , no . Guys ? Guys ! Get out of here . Go ! What about you ? Just go . Oh-oh . No ! You killed him . Get in the vehicle . No . Get in the vehicle . We have to go now . Jake ! Jake ! Jake ! No ! Jake ! Whoa . Joe . Get up . He tried to kill me . He took the gem . I told you about him . He 's got your girl . You 've got to stop him from detonating the Omega seed . How ? I don 't care how you do it , but at least get your girl back before the big kaboom . We 'd better ammo up inside . Put the saw away if you understand me . Put it away ! You might be tough , but one of these in the face is gonna do some damage , so you gonna listen to me . You understand ? Good . So , you 're here to protect us ? Stop the Omega seed ? How can I trust you ? I am a centurion . I have pledged my life to protect this planet and the Omega seed . The other , he is a rogue , a terrorist . The rod he carries Is the switch that will detonate the seed and destroy us all . What about those men and women you killed ? It was they who attacked me . Do you not have order on this planet ? Are the rules not the same ? I want heavy artillery ready within the hour . Make sure everyone is loaded with explosive armour piercing rounds . That 'll slow his ass down . Yes , Sir . We 're ready . Establish a blackout as well . I don 't wanna see any other military faces here but ours . Am I clear ? Yes , Sir . Move your ass , soldier ! Sir . Jake . Open fire ! Jake is with Kronnan . They 're gonna stop you . No . Please . Please , please , please . Take it . You never told us the exact location , correct ? No . Take the Ether rod and go there . I do not know where the Omega seed is . Kronnan does . It was his species that created it , not mine . Then why is Kronnan chasing us ? To get the Ether rod . To prevent the shutdown . Take it . To deactivate the Omega seed you must slide the Ether rod into the terminating port . I beg you . Go and do it immediately . How do I know it won 't detonate it ? If you do not trust me , wait until Kronnan reaches the Omega seed . Then you will know the truth . Please , go . Time is running out . I will delay Kronnan long enough for you to do what is necessary . Please . What are you doing ? Go ! She 's on the path . Hurry ! Jude ? Jude ? Oh ! Ow ! Jake ! Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . Jude saved my life . I can 't believe I trusted Kronnan . We have a job to do . How much further ? Just over the ridge . What do we do when we get there ? Jude said we have to connect this to the terminating port . Whatever that means . One port is the off switch . The other detonates us all . Great . That 's it ? I don 't know . It 's a little anticlimactic . There it is . Oh , my God . Give me a hand here . Going down ? Going down . Be careful . Jake ! Wow . Wow . It 's okay . It 's some sort of air duct or something . I think It 's safe . That 's what you said when we went hand-gliding in Cabo . Stop it . The Omega seed . It 's supposed to reach all the way down to the Earth 's core . From the looks of it , we don 't have much time . Let 's go . This way . Can I see it for a moment ? Start looking for the terminating port . What does it look like ? No idea . Oh , well , then this should be a piece of cake . Wait a second . The symbols . Did you find a match ? Maybe . Ah ! The Ether rod . Where is it ? The Ether rod . Kronnan ! Jake ! Jude ! No ! This is the one . Stop the seed . Help . Help me . Wait . Thank you . C 'mon . C 'mon . Right over here . Over here . Hurry . C 'mon . C 'mon . Give me your hand . Give me your hand . I 'm sorry about Alex . Thanks . He was so , so proud of you . Do you think so ? Oh . I , I know so . I 'm proud of you , too . Yeah ? Well , you didn 't do so bad yourself . Did you really throw a whole career for me ? Would it matter if I didn 't ? No .

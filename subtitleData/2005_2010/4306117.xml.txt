 You 're lucky Galen comes from a religious background . Duck says he believes , but I can never get him in here with me . Galen 's having his own crisis of faith . Finding out Brother Cavil was a Cylon didn 't help . Still , you got him to agree to hold the dedication ceremony to the Gods for your son . A small miracle . Well , it 's the small ones that keep me going . Like finding fresh greens for sale ? I got you some . I thought you might be too busy . Oh , thank you . MAN : It 's our temple ! What 's that ? MAN : Go back ! Go back ! Infidels ! Stand aside , we 're coming in ! Cylons . Centurions ? What do they want in here ? Come on ! MAN 1 : Open the temple ! MAN 2 : If you insist ! Stand your ground ! Wait , my bag . ( GUNS FIRING )

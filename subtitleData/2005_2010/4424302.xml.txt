 I 'd tell you that they 'd run off ... or ... they were at the infirmary . Some of them I 'd say I saw them eating with their families . " Didn 't you see them ? Oh , I 'm sure you 'll see them tomorrow . " Didn 't you see them ? I 'm sure you 'll see them tomorrow . No . I remember , I saw ... I saw them , I know I saw them . They can 't be ... I saw Jenkins . I saw Penbroke . I saw them . I saved a few ... so you could make yourself not know about the rest ... I saw ... I saw ... Heather Redmond and her baby . They were playing together . I saw them . I know I saw them ... I 'm a woman ... and a Cylon . I didn 't seduce you . Hope seduced you . And the more you ate of it , the less you saw . You ate yourself blind . Why didn 't you just kill us when you knew that we were lost ? I 'm not a monster . I didn 't want to do what I did . I did it when the probabilities dictated it . You kill when you 're in a war . You kill when you have to . You kill the ones your enemy values . It 's basic . You should know that . I trusted you . How could I have guessed ? Baltar did . Oh , what , he didn 't tell you ? Or did you block that out too ? What did you tell them ? That you stayed behind till the grisly end on New Caprica , so that you could , what ? So you could ... You could feed information to the resistance . Who do you think allowed you to do that ? - That 's a lie . - No , it 's not a lie . You think I 'm blind ? You see , I literally had a gun ... pointed to my head . But nobody forced you to play both sides . There 's not much difference between my brain and yours , Felix . We can choose ... to not make the connection ! You can see someone kill in front of you ... twice ... and still hang on to your ignorance . Instead of calling it a flaw , you call it ... hope , or ... faith ... love . So , I 'm asking you Mr. Gaeta ... who is the real traitor in this room ? - I 'm not a traitor . - No , of course , because there are far worse things than being a traitor , aren 't there ? If your friends only knew the truth ... But don 't worry ... I know about your little secret . I know what your Eight did !

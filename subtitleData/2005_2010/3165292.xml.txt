 Previously on Bionic Woman If I have a place to take the monster down , I will go alone on that roof top . You 've done this before , haven 't you ? You want to tell me why you knew that guy was arriving at the airport before Jonas even called me ? Just trust me . They know you were here . They 're sending more agents as we speak . Antonio is communicating with the assassin . You 're gonna have to bring him in . No , actually , you 're gonna have to bring him in . You want to tell me what the hell is going on ? I heard you with the assassin . I 'm not working with the assassin . But I do know her . She saved my life . Why the hell should I believe any of what you 're saying ? You gotta believe me on this one . Julia , stop ! Take the shot , Antonio . Shut up , Sommers . Clear ! He just had such a rough exterior , you know ? You think that he doesn 't care if you 're having a rough day or not , but he does . Or he did . To Antonio Pope . It was an honor to know him , to work with him . I 'm gonna miss you , pal . Yep . I slept with him once . It was amazing . Come here for a second . So you doing OK ? Yeah , I 'm good . Because , you know , someone died , someone who was ... a friend of yours , who you cared about so ... You know what , I 'm getting used to it . Honky with the dreads is off the hook . How do you think I would look with those , honestly ? I can tell when you 're rolling your eyes . Can you tell when I don 't care ? Touch√© . Why aren 't you asking me who this guy is and why we 're following him ? why aren 't you peppering me with questions ? Fine , who is he ? He 's a bad guy . Why is he a bad guy ? Because he does bad things . This is starting to sound like phone sex . If this is what phone sex sounds like to you , you 're doing it wrong . You have no idea , do you ? What about , sex ? No , none , zero . I do know that women Cry a lot afterwards . OK , that 's-that 's-what the hell - Who the hell are you ? Shut up ! What the hell was that ? How ' bout you just Shut the hell up . We 'll get to Berkut , and you can ask your questions to somebody who cares . Hmm . Would you just get up ? ! She 's totally PMS-ing . Get up ! Hey , it 's me . Sorry we keep missing each other . Had another long day at work , And I , uh , just needed to hear a friendly voice . You know , I 'm starting to get really confused About what I 'm doing and why . And now I have to go upstairs , And put on a big smile , and see my sister , And pretend like everything 's OK . And ... Yeah . Anyway , you 're probably working too , so , well , uh , call me later . What is he doing here ? He 's doing dishes . Why ? Jamie , I don 't know . He 's your boss . Why don 't you go talk to him . Hey , you wanna dry ? Becks , could you give us a minute ? I don 't know what you think you 're doing , but this is my personal space . You know , your sister watches way too much TV . This is the home of a depressed person . I am working all hours , and you come here and criticize my housekeeping ? I came over here because I 'm concerned about you . You 've been through a lot . You need to take some time off . Is this because I kicked that guy 's ass ? No . It 's because Antonio was your friend . And he died . And you need time . Work is the only thing holding me together right now . If I stop and think about everything that has happened to me , I 'm gonna go crazy . I understand that . But it 's not a good strategy , Jaime . I 'm not asking you , I 'm telling you . You 're gonna take a vacation , and Berkut will pay for it . I don 't take handouts . OK , then you can make a delivery for me . I need to get a briefcase to a man in Montana . You give him the briefcase , you take a week off . Do you like to hike ? You sure that 's it ? It 's just a briefcase . Antonio used to say a briefcase is never just a briefcase . Yeah , well ... Antonio 's dead . Are you mad at me ? No . Seems like you got something on your mind . That 's the most you 've said for the past two days . What are we doing ? I mean , why is it OK for me to suddenly ditch school ? You 're not ditching school . I wrote you an excuse , so it 's fine . We 're just taking a little trip . That 's what we 're doing . I mean , you know , you mope around the house for a week , not taking care of yourself . And , I mean , clearly something is wrong . And now , all of a sudden , we 're on this trip . I mean , what do you think it 's gonna accomplish ? You think we 're gonna have deep talks and bond ? Yeah , that 's exactly what we 're gonna do . We 're gonna talk and take spa treatments , grab some food , make memories . It 's gonna be great . What are you doing here , Nathan ? I want you to train me . Train you to what ? I want to learn how to fight . Aren 't you supposed to be at a Star Trek convention or something ? I 'm serious , Jae . What happened to your eye ? JR . Who 's JR ? He 's my older brother . Sometimes he gets a little physical with me . Aren 't you a little old for your brother to be picking on you ? Yeah , I 'm also a little too old to be living with my parents , but I 'm working on it . So why does he hit you ? He 's just always been a little jealous of me . Why ? Hey , I just have to make a call . OK . I thought you had to go to the bathroom . I do , I just need to make this call . For work ? Yeah . Look , it 's the last one I 'm gonna make , OK ? After that , I 'll give you my cell . No more . Really ? - Really . All right . Sorry . Sorry . You 're Jonas ' girl ? Just say it so I can get out of here . Give me the briefcase . So what are the rumours goin ' round about you ? Yep . Yep , I do . In 1972 , a crack commando unit was sent to prison by military court for a crime they didn 't commit . These men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade to the Los Angeles underground . Today , still wanted by the government , they survive as soldiers of fortune . If you have a problem , if no one else can help , and if you can find them , maybe you can hire the A-team . Bang . Bang . Bang . You want me to do the theme song for you ? Have a nice life . You 're registered in the Green Party ? What ? Are you actually gonna vote for Dennis Kucinich ? How do you know this ? Visual caller ID . Anyone calls my line , I see their photo , date of birth , social security number , criminal record , you name it . Nathan set it up for me . Is that legal ? How 's the vacation going ? Your guy 's a nut job . Is it done ? Yep . Bye , Jonas . Thank you . You sure you don 't miss your phone ? Not even a little . Your thumbs must be going through withdrawal . You haven 't texted anyone in , like , an hour . Leave me alone . So what are we gonna do ? There 's a million things to do . There 's horseback riding . There 's a spa . There 's friggin ballroom dancing classes . Oh , there 's meditation with gems . That sounds different . How ' bout we go up to the room , order some room service , turn on the TV . You know , eat and get really fat , So no one will love us . God , I love you . Come on , let 's go . Switch . Switch . Mm-hmm . OK , how can I help you ? Our on-demand isn 't working , and TV 's really important to us . We 'll send up an engineer . What room ? 108 . You 're 108 ? - Yeah . This guy has been calling for you for the past hour . He asked me to go to your room and knock on the door . But I told him it 's against hotel policy . He 's a very pushy man . I ... Uh ... Sorry . You break it , you have to pay . Excuse me . Front desk . Please hold , sir . No sir , I will not - Please hold . It 's him . Should I transfer it to one of the courtesy phones ? Yeah . Just over there . Jaime , why did you turn off your cell phone ? 'Cause you told me I needed a vacation , so I turned my cell phone off . I told you to take a little time off . Not to go off the grid . I 'm not off the grid . It 's a four star hotel I 'm at . Listen , I got a problem . My guy 's gone quiet . He never checked in . Oh , Jonas . He 's a little unstable . No kidding . So can you look in on him for me ? Listen , I would never ask you to do this if it wasn 't an emergency . He 's staying in room 203 . He 's staying here ? Yeah , I know . I was surprised too . He seemed like more Of a seedy motel kinda guy . Can you do this for me or not ? OK . I was booking us spa treatments . She kept me on hold for ten minutes . Becks , you know , I was thinking about what you said . And I know you 're not stupid . I know I 've been acting weird lately , and anything . And- - what ? OK , OK , stop talking . Because listen , OK , I met this - Hey . Nick . This is my sister Jaime . Jaime , this is Nick . Hey , Nick . Nice to meet you . Hey . Well , I 'm starving . Um , you wanna go get some breakfast ? Great , you two grab a table , and I 'll run upstairs and book the spa appointments . OK . OK ? Hey . In case you 're looking for this , don 't even bother . I 'm insulted . OK , isn 't he cute ? Super cute . And we hate All the same things . I mean - Hello ? Oh , my God . Yeah ? Jonas , he 's dead . He 's laying right in front of me , And he 's dead . How ? Maybe it has something to do With the hypodermic needle sticking out of his arm . Damn it . Obviously I 'm on the job now , Jonas . So just fill me in . No , I 'm not gonna do that to you . What was I delivering ? Who the hell is this guy ? It 's not your problem , Jaime . Oh , my God . He 's an assassin ? ! Were you gonna have somebody killed ? What was in that briefcase ? Don 't worry about it . Don 't worry about it ? The guy is lying here dead . Someone is gonna come in and find him . OK , listen , put him in the bathtub . Get a bunch of ice and some air fresheners , And I 'll send someone down to deal with it as soon as I can . I can 't believe this is happening . What am I supposed to do with the briefcase ?

These lovely ladies as an excuse to avoid that gondola ride , are you , sport ? No , Dad . They 're gonna come too . Great . The more the merrier . I 'm Vincent Aldridge . I 'm Nick 's dad . Hi . Nice to meet you . - Hi . Come on , It 's not that painful . give us a smile . This is why I told you I didn 't want to work With Javier . I 've got a body on a target in play , and nobody to squeeze . Well , then you just make it right . Hi , I 'm Jaime . I 'll call you back , man . I 'm Matt . How 's it going ?

The target 's son is now flirting with my sister . We 're all supposed to be going on a gondola ride at 1 : 00 . Who is he ? He 's a very bad guy , Jaime , and you 're way out of your league . Can you just fill me in everything ? OK , he 's a nuclear engineer who 's about to sell technology to the North Koreans . He 's posing as an accountant . What kind of technology ? He 's developed a more efficient way to enrich plutonium . It 'll give ' em weapons-grade fissile material that 's 99 % pure . You 're looking at a man who 's about to hand North Korea a nuclear bomb . Don 't theye lready have one ? This one would work .

What 'd you - Whoa , whoa , whoa . Easy , easy . Oh , God . It 's all the weapons around - What are you doing ? I 've been looking all over for you . Jae 's teaching me how to fight . What happened to your eye ? Oh , my brother ... - I actually don 't even want to know . So listen . We 've locked in on the engineer in Montana , But I can 't find a button man . What are you gonna do ? I 'm going to Montana . And you 're coming with me . Why do I- - Why am I coming with you ? Is he ready ? Yeah , he 's Got a couple of moves . R-ready ? What ? It 's actually only one move . He 'll be all right . You 're my backup . If I miss the target , go center mass , bang , bang , then put one in his head . What ? I 'm not - I 'm kidding .

It 's fantastic . Unfortunately , I can 't use it this year , and I 'd like to sell it . But since they introduced that new tax clause - I 'm sorry to intervene , Mr. Aldridge , but we kind of have a no work rule in effect right now . Oh , hey , I 'm sorry . I completely understand . Gotta play too , right ? Yeah , sometimes you mistake your job for your life . Which isn 't such a bad thing if you love what you do . Do you love what you do , Mr. Aldridge ? Me ? Are you kidding me ? I wake up every morning with a giant smile plastered on my face because I love what I do so much . Jaime , please , Call me Vincent , hmm ? Who are those guys , Vincent ?

Watch your step , ladies and gentlemen . Well , maybe we 'll see you guys for dinner ? Yeah . Sure . Come on , Nick , let 's go . What was that about accounting ? What ? Nick 's dad never said he was an accountant . It was a real conversation stopper . OK , I 'm gonna go shower and warm up before we go to the ... Cool . Yeah , Jaime . Jonas , I think I messed up . I think I got made . Is that what you say ? This guy Vincent , I think he made me . OK , that 's a problem . Yeah , I know it is . What do I do now ? You 're gonna have to take him out . Take him out where ? Jaime , listen to me . He knows who you are . He 's not gonna wait long . You have to kill him before he kills you . OK , I 'm all robed up . You ready for the most relaxing three hours of our lives ? Totally . Let 's go . Let 's go . Heat wraps or ... rejuvenating facial . Yeah , your skin 's too young for anything else . Right this way , Miss Sommers . So I 'll see you in three hours . Yeah , we probably won 't even recognize ourselves , we 'll be so pretty . I have to go somewhere . If you could make sure my sister stays in that room for the next three hours , I 'll make it worth your while . OK . Thanks . I don 't think I can do this . Trust me , I understand . Do you have any advice ? I do , but you 're not gonna like it . Don 't think of him as a person . That 's gonna be hard for me . I just spent two hours on a gondola With him and his son . You gotta think about what could happen if you don 't do it , Jaime . It does get easier . That 's what scares me . Thanks , Jae . Hi . Yes . I need to talk to Vincent . I 'm sorry , he 's not here . I 'm going to have to ask you to leave . Well , if I could just take a look , that would be - OK , we can do this the easy way or the hard way . You 're coming with me . It 's on the left . Did you do it ? No , I couldn 't do it . I was nowhere near being able to do it . You know , in an hour and 45 minutes Becca is gonna walk through that door . So can you start by telling me what I 'm supposed to do now ? I need you to calm down and put him on the phone . He wants to talk to you . Vincent , Jonas Bledsoe here . It 's nice to meet you over the phone . You with me ? Yes , I 'm here . The way I see it , you 've got two options . Number one , I kill you . The other one is you talk . And by " talk " I mean you tell me everything I need to know to keep this technology out of North Korea . Which would you prefer ? It doesn 't matter to me . I just need to know whether or not to wear gloves . I understand your son is with you . I 'll talk . But you 've got to get me out of here , or my own people will kill me first . And my son comes with me . Done . Dad , where are we going ? Little change of plans , sport . Matt , do you wanna get my car , please ? Oh , I already called for Mr. Aldridge 's car . Fine . I 'll drive . Thanks . Thank you . What 's going on , Dad ? You 're gonna have to tell him sooner or later . I can raise my son without your help . Thank you . It 's nothing you need to worry about , Nick . Does it have something to do with your job ? You hear that ? Hear what ? Get out of the car . - Why ? Get out . Nick , get out . Out ! Dad , it won 't open . Open the door . - I can 't open it ! Open the door ! - Dad , it 's stuck . I can 't get out . Come on . Come on . Come on . It 's all in the wrist . Jonas . Somebody tried to blow up Vincent 's car with him in it . Is he OK ? Yeah . Where are you ? Five miles south of the hotel . How are you fixed for transportation ? I stole a car . That 's my girl . Look , we 're heading west on the road . I think we 're being followed . Well , slow down and see if he passes . We should- - we should get away more often together , road trip . Shut up . He passed . A good tail is always from the front . You hungry , sport ? No . Who are you ? And how the hell did you rip that door off my car ? Maybe you should be happy I did and not ask questions . You saved my son 's life . Thank you for that . He 's a sweet kid . Takes after his mom . I thinve lost him . Maybe he deserves to know the truth about his dad . Maybe your sister deserves to know the truth about you . It 's a different situation . Hello . Did you get the plate on that truck ? XUV-05 . Well , it 's here , and so am I. Get out of there and meet me up front . We need to move now . Vincent , let 's get you out of here right now . What about my son ? We 'll pick up his mother . We can put ' em in protective custody . You can speak to ' em after you 've made your statement . Jaime ! Jaime ! Jaime , it 's Matt ! Who 's that guy ? - The valet guy . The guy whose phone I used to call you . The guy whose phone you used looked nothing like this . Clean this up for me . I 'll take you back to the hotel . It 's gonna be all right . The Berkut guys are on their way . I 'm worried that if I keep lying to her , I 'm gonna lose her . So don 't lie to her . I don 't want her to think I 'm a fak . Listen , I never said you couldn 't tell her . You 've got to do what 's right For your family , Jaime . I found that out too late . The question you have to ask yourself ... Is is she ready to hear it ? Anything has to be better than this . Maybe , maybe not . See , here 's the thing , Every person who knows is a potential source of information for people who might want to scrap you for parts or technology . Teenagers aren 't exactly known for their discretion . And if- - If you 're at great risk , then so is Becca . It 's complicated . Yeah . I think either way she 's lucky because she 's got you for a big sister . Thanks . Hey . How was yours ? It was great . You look great . Yeah . Look , I wouldn 't tip your girl too much . Ah ! I 'm sorry , you don 't look any better . That was , like , three hours for nothing . Thanks . Come on . Nick never said good-bye . No ? - No . That 's OK though , I wasn 't that into him anyway . Oh , this trip had learning . Hey . Yes , it 's more fun to be with a guy who gives you the time of day . Good for you . And I 'm glad we came . I had fun with you . Maybe we could do this again sometime . What ? What ? - You 're freaking me out . Is something on your mind ? There 's something i should tell you . What ? There this guy who I work with who died . I didn 't even really know him that well , but what I realized is , it 's really affected me . Was he a guy you liked or something ? No , it wasn 't like that . I 'm really sorry . Why didn 't you tell me about this ? I didn 't want you to worry about me . Well , that was really stupid . I know . Jaime , you can talk to me about this stuff , OK ? I 'm a lot stronger than you think I am . OK . Now , is there anything else you want to tell me ? No . Nothing at all .

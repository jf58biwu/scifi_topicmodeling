 It 's coming ! Get ready , it 's coming ! ( growling ) Professor Hamilton ! Does it work ? ( on radio ) " Professor ... Professor " ( static ) " Professor Hamilton ... " Yes ? Professor Hamilton , are you receiving me ? This is Ulf ! Hamilton ... Ulf , I can 't hear you . ( roar ) Professor Hamilton , are you receiving me ? I can 't get a hold of him . It doesn 't work . Professor Hamilton , are you receiving me ? This is Ulf ! I can 't hear ... I can 't ... " Hello . " " Professor Hamilton , are you receiving me ? " " We have one ! " We caught one ! You caught one ? ! Yes , yes , yes . Good work . Good work . ( roaring ) It will never hold it ... " The cage is not holding ! " They 've got one ! Go ! Go ! Are you upset ? Anything you want to say before we get started ? I 'm Greg , an anthropologist , and I study wild and wicked animals . But I prefer Homo Sapiens . With big tits . Look , look , look ! Give me the camera . - Give me the camera . - No , no , no ! Oh yeah , look at that . That 's the stuff . For God 's sake , Greg , would you give it a rest ? Hi - I 'm Dani . Keep the bloody thing still , Greg ! I have to make this look as professional as possible . - Not some film for free . - Okay , Okay . Action . Where is it ? We are making a video documenting this trip . Heading into a jungle where an expedition is already in progress . Hi . I am your pilot . Okay . Isn 't he supposed to be wearing like a cap and stuff ? No survivors . Not a chance . So , are you excited - we 're almost there . Yes , definitely . Amy , give us a little insight into your mind the mind of a psychologist . Can I say " No " ? Seth , come on - say something . Anything . Try Josh . Josh , talk to me , please . What , tell you my hopes and fears and all that ? Yeah , sure ! Oh - that was a joke . But seriously , I am extremely excited to be embarking on this expedition As the boss said , it 's a real once in a lifetime experience . Bla , bla , bla . Oh look . What a surprise . The jocks beating up the nerd . Are you saying I 'm a nerd ? Are you kidding ? I love this guy ! Hey , how do you want me - like this ? Or - like this . - What are you trying to do ? - Me ? I 'm Greg - the good looking one . Oh , and I 'm also like a super genius at anthropology . If I 'm like here - Jane Goodall is like here . Who 's Jane Goodall ? Only one of the most brilliant anthropologists and primatologists ever . She 's even got her own institute . See why I love that guy ? - Does that thing have a night vision option ? - Yeah . Sweet ! I 'm going to need to use it later . - Why ? - Why ? ! Why ? ! For the Sydney show . Coffee 's ten dollars . Oh God , really ? I don 't even have any makeup on . Yeah , Sydney , you do . Oh - you caught me . Yay , you . So , it says here you have a first in social anthropology . - Really ? - Yeah , really . Okay , so can you say it to the camera ? I have to get all the intros done before we head into the wild . Didn 't you just do the introduction already ? I would like to take this opportunity to ... give a big " what up " to the kids back home . What up . Oh , come on Seth , just do the thing : " Hi , I 'm ... " Hi , I 'm Seth . I study anthropology . Was that so hard ? I 'm having second thoughts . Sorry . Are you the students ? Yeah . - Hey . - What ? I said hey . I can 't hear you . - Loud . - What ? Hey , is this the place ? I don 't think it 's the place . Definitely not the place . I no go . - You no go ? - Wait - he 's leaving us . There are things in there . Like , tigers and stuff ? Maybe , but ... You 're saying somebody else will pick us up ? - We wait here ? - What bad things ? I can go no further . Follow track . Follow track - where ? Follow track . So - we start walking , or what ? - You alright ? - Yeah , sure . Why ? I don 't know - you 're so quiet . You 've always been quiet , but you 're unusually so . Don 't mind me - I can 't talk right . Just thinking about - trying to acclimatize , I guess . The sounds - the shadows . I know . What 's that ? Global Positioning System It should let me know exactly where we are . Great ! So , where are we ? ( whistling in jungle ) - What 's that ? - I don 't know . I 'm a little jittery . Alright - you can do that as much as you like . ( Dani screams ) What is that ? , It 's not funny ! - Ow ! - That 's not funny ! - What 's wrong with you ? - Josh , I told you that thing would come in handy . You should pick your nose while you 're at it . Aarrg ! That was a big one . You wish . Come on , let 's go - let 's move it on . Let 's take it on home . Let 's go . We 're in the jungle ! That 's it . - It ? - No more track . So , what do we do now ? We wait . What ? We 're gonna wait here ? Looks like that 's the plan . We 're stranded . I can 't believe it . Well , keep up the good work . How long will you wait before you tell him you 've got a lighter ? Five , maybe ten more minutes . He 's like , obsessed with it . I bet he 's a Taurean - stubborn and obsessive . - You do horoscopes ? - Yeah , sure . Like Sydney . She 's an Arian . True ? Wow . You 're good . Smart ass See anything ? No - not really . Yeah How could you . We should get back to the guys . Yeah - Did you guys hear that ? - Yeah . What was it ? It sounded far away but the echo sort of sounded ... Sort of , yeah . I know what you mean . It scared me , too . Hey guys ! I 've got smoke ! I think I 've got smoke . Wait a minute . Let me see . That is not funny . Why did you stop ? I think I saw smoke . It 's not funny ! - Hey , guys . - Yeah ? ( growling ) Oh my God . What is it ? Something big . What is it ? Oh my God . Dani - the camera . - Why ? - The night vision . - Oh my God . - Oh man . Can you see it ? Something . I hear something . Keep still . Keep still . ( roar ) ( roars ) ( roaring fades ) - Who are you ? - I Am Chenne . I am with the professor Hamilton . The cavalry . It 's about time . Come . Wait ... uh , When do we get to see Professor Hamilton ? When he is ready . Right . What do you think about Jungle Jane ? She 's something else . She 's definitely a bit of a ... Piece ? Greg , must you always insist on being such a prat ? Yeah . Good morning , students ! I am Professor Hamilton ! Breakfast is in 10 minutes . And we leave in 40 . Leave ? Where to ? You 've hit the jackpot here . We have all hit the jackpot ! A valley , untouched . Undiscovered . Flora and fauna . Unlike anything you have ever seen . Wait . I thought we were just going to be here . To study the same things you see in your textbooks and your classrooms at home ? Or you have the opportunity to write the new textbooks ! To bring home the newly discovered specimens to those classrooms . Each one of you . Blazing new trails ! It 's rare to go where no human being has ever gone before . Oh ! These days men have too look to the skies and beyond to achieve that . Not us ! We have that right here ! So - chop chop ! No time to lose . That had to be rehearsed . Had to be . Had to be ! I don 't know . No , no - this is good . It 's cool . This is cool . You 're the quiet one .. Ready to blaze new trails and all that ? I don 't know . Ever get the feeling that you 're not getting the whole truth ? Hello ? Where are the others ? He told us there would be others , right ? Anyone else think that Professor Hamilton is a little you know ... strange . And this camp . Is this base ? I mean . When did he do all the work ? Hey guys , this is my first time here as well , you know ? They told me there would be others . Yes , we heard you . So , you guys think Professor Hamilton and that chick Chenne , are ... It 's not as if everybody else wasn 't thinking it . Oh , I was . I 'm just surprised you said it . Hey , guys . Hey anyone see my cell phone ? - No . - Where did you last have it ? Where I just looked , obviously . What 's going on ? Syd 's lost her phone . No , somebody stole it . Hey , what 's the deal ? Mine 's gone too . Who 's nabbing phones ? I am . You stole our stuff ? Turn camera off . - Now ! - I don 't see why I should . Why should she ? ! That was mine ! Was is the operative word . Look , can we please have back our stuff ... Nothing in that bag belongs ... Chenne was obeying my order ! The nature of your abilities is not a concern . Your trust , however , is . I will not risk the leaking of any information while on this project . Alright , listen up . Who 's missing ? Nice of you to join us . I want you to consider these your badges of honor . They are dog tags - before marching into battle . But sir , we already know each other . Sir Oh ? This isn 't me . - I 'm Greg . - Ah ! Greg ... how interesting . The rare blood type , Greg - OH . Seth . Yeah - that 's me . Now , these tags contain all the information needed in case ... of an emergency . But be sure you wear your own . Pick yours out . Pick out your name tag . Wear them - it could save your life . The jungle is not good for the complexion . It 's so hot . And that 's five minutes . Everybody up ! Ah ! Oh , it 's beautiful , isn 't it ? Yeah . You 're gonna want to have that ready for this ! - Whoa ! - Yeah , so ? And it 's all uncharted . All unknown . All for me . For us ! How exactly do we get down ? - That 's how we get down . - Yeah . You have got to be kidding me . No way . No way . So here the journey ends . You can 't expect us ... Ah , it 'll be fine ! It 'll be fun ! It 's important to push onesself in this life . Especially now . With great risk comes great reward . Exactly ! I read it in one of Josh 's comics . I 'm not going - I can 't do this . - What are you going to do ? - Go back . Go back ? I can 't let you do that . You 're robbing yourself of a great opportunity . - But I 'm not ... - I am counting on you . For documentation . Ah ! Perhaps an introduction . Sorry , guys , but ... I did fine up to this ! No , you have to prove it to yourself . I am Professor Conrad Hamilton . I am standing on the edge of the Hamilton Crater . Situated below - a valley unspoiled . In its most pure and natural state . As it was millions of years ago so it remains today . Have you gone through this yet , Professor ? Entered into this valley ? No , we will be the first . You are watching history . And each one of you will be living it ! Okay guys , I 'll see you down there . See you down there ! I 'll be waiting for you . Go ahead . Go . Not looking forward to this . Come on in ! The water 's fine ! Oh my God . This harness is riding up in places that I ... Really . I really need a bathroom . You guys okay up there ? You 're looking good from down here ! Wasn 't so bad , was it , now . Hey , just drop ... I 'll catch you ! Oh my God , don 't look down . - You just looked down , didn 't you . - No . Oh , crap ! Man , I 've never seen 2 girls coming down on me like this ! Is that guy ever serious ? ! Would you want him to be ? Shut Up ! Go . Go ! I can 't believe we just did that . Oh , yes . Come on Josh ! Come on Josh , you can do it ! Come on Josh ! That 's it , buddy ! Down ! Down ! - Down ! - I can 't ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Now ! Now ! Josh , slow down ! Go now ! Go , now ! Josh , slow down ! Josh , let go of the rope ! Let go of the rope ! Josh , slow down ! Slow down ! ( crying ) Josh ! Aaaaaaaah ! Ah ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! The bitch kicked me ! Let 's go . Pick him up or carry him - but we 've got to go ! You can assist him when we make camp . Well , we 're not going to leave him here . Okay , Josh . Let 's get him up . You alright ? Alright - I 'll be fine . Josh , are you sure ? Ow ! No . What 's this ? Headquarters . Base camp . Weren 't we supposed to be the first ones down here ? Yeah , we were . That was the argument . So , this is where the others are ? Others ? You 're the others . While I shouldn 't have to explain myself , I will admit that I may have twisted the truth a little , but I had to get you down here . Look ... No one else needs to hear this ! Yes , myself and Chenne have decended into the valley before . But - we have yet to explore the outer limit . What about all those extra packs ? Who 's are they ? - Professor . - Huh ? I need you to come to see . Ah , yes . We will continue this later . - Better ? - Yeah . Yeah , much better . Thanks She 's watching over him . Yeah , it 's good . Come on , seriously . I am serious . The guy is insane . You know I can 't use that . Why not ? You 're supposed to be documenting the truth , aren 't you ? Yeah , but still ... Hang on . Incoming - twelve o 'clock . - What ? - Behind you . Gather ' round . A little food for thought . Does anyone know what this is ? It 's part of a skull . Einstein . It 's nice . Can I see it ? - That 's weird . - What ? What is it , Seth ? It 's a monkey 's skull . Moving on . No , definitely not a monkey . - So ... human . - That thing ? Yeah , right . It is ... I believe what Sydney 's coming to terms with is she doesn 't quite know what it is . No kidding . But I should ? But you should . I mean - aside from the distorted features look at the cranium . The volume - it 's like us . I mean - we 're ... Twelve hundred cubic centimeters in volume . Right . And this has got to be at least ... Fourteen ? Fifteen . It 's got to be above ... Eighteen hundred cubic centimeters . When did this creature become extinct ? It isn 't . ( screams ) Chenne , take him ! Take him ! Take him ! Stay there ! Stay right there ! Help me . So I 'll just go ahead and be the one to say it . What the hell was that all about ? It 's just me . You better watch that . What is that ? Chenne is digging . Now ? At night ? I think it 's for our benefit . It 's a grave . - For that guy ? - Yeah . They got him out of the tent a little while ago . Something is not right here . I mean we 're students , not professionals . Not yet , anyway . We 're not supposed to be in life threatening situations . I got enough of that at student parties . - Did you understand any of that skull stuff ? . - Yeah . Evolutionary intelligence is measured by the size of the skull . - So . - So we 're looking at a new species , maybe . Only , I don 't understand why we 're here if he 's so protective of it . I know . Sydney and Josh were talking about going back tomorrow . - They 're scared . - Yeah . But how ? She says she feels confident she could find her way back . What about you ? Will you go with them ? I was thinking about it . I 'm starting to feel a little like a hostage . Yeah . Come on , let 's go . They let him go . This was a warning . I 've gotta go . The others don 't need to know , but I gotta go . I really gotta piss . Who is there ? Greg ? Come on , guys , this is private time . Get lost ! Enough ! I 'm going to waste you guys ! Hey ! Sydney left . - What ? - I woke up and she was gone . She wouldn 't leave us even if she knew the way , would she ? - Did Hamilton say anything about it ? - No . Dead man walking . Come in or go away ! Sit . Well , what is it ? Did Sydney come and talk to you this morning ? Which one is she , the brunette ? The blond . Oh , yeah . - Well , I mean - did she ... - Yes , she did . Ah ! So , she left . I mean , you let her leave ? Let her leave ? Why wouldn 't I ? It 's not like you 're in prison here . I had Chenne escort her back early this morning . She came to see me . I explained what we were doing here she sounded intrigued , but thought it was best she left . Homesick , she said . - Really ? - Yeah . Just seems kind of odd . What does ? Maybe , she would have waited for the rest of us . To say goodbye at least . Well , you know women . They get an idea in their heads ... And what ? What it is exactly we 're doing here Professor ? You 're getting an idea in your head . You shouldn 't . I won 't tolerate mutiny on my crew , you understand ? I want you to rally the troops ! Because we 're going in further . Going in uncharted territory , I promise you that . But Josh , with his ankle , there 's no way we can go into uncharted territory . He can stay , but the rest of you the rest of you must come with me , if I 'm to accomplish anything . Seth ... I 'm relying on you . Will you do this for me ? What did he say ? He said we need to move out . We need to pack up . We 're moving further in . But what about Sydney ? He said he had Chenne take her back safely . So she 's going to be alright ? Yeah - I 'm sure she 'll be fine . It 's just that I didn 't think that she would leave without saying goodbye to me , that 's all . - She wouldn 't . - What do you mean ? Well , I just think Sydney ... nothing . Alright ... let 's move . Hey ... you alright ? Seth , what 's going on ? He said you can stay here if you want - hold down the fort . Alone ? No . No , I 'll cope . What do you think ? Yeah - we 'd best stick together . - Seth . - Look - let 's just get going , yeah ? I 'll think of something , okay ? ( screaming ) Help me ! Help me ! Please , don 't . Please , don 't leave me here . Help ! Who 's that ? It 's working . - What is it ? . - Hold on . What about Sydney ? You took her back ? Yes , Sydney returned safely . She got back pretty damn quick . As you can see , Chenne moves pretty damn quick . Yeah , but even so ... Prepare to move out ! Two minutes ! Guys , we have to do something . - I feel like ... - Like bait ? What do you mean ? I don 't think it 's this place he 's interested in . I think it 's what 's living here that he 's into . What are you doing ? Bread crumbs . Like markers - when we need to get out of here we 'll have those . But how are we going to do that ? The gun - we 've got to get the gun . We do it tonight . - What about Josh ? - If we get the gun we don 't need to worry about anything . We can take our time with Josh . Move out ! This way . ( grunt ) Ah ! Perfect . We 'll camp here ! Pitch your tents there . Oh , flies ! Millions of them ! I hate them . Right , let 's get you away from that mess . It 's like a warning . A warning ? Yeah , that 's exactly what it is . It 's a warning for us . Let 's go . What 's that ? It 's nothing . Don 't worry about it . You really think it 's a good idea to stay here ? Yes , I do . ( growling in jungle ) Professor ! What is it ? ( growling stops ) Start talking . Yes . I suppose it 's time . I have uncovered a new species of primate . A completely separate branch of evolution . One that could possibly tie up the loose ends . The ... Missing Link ? How can you call something missing when it 's been found - no ! This is an offshoot . You mean to say they 've been breeding down here for thousands of years ? So , what do you call it , then ? Them - what does he call them ? Frankly , I just ... I don 't know ! It 's been like trying to prove the existence of Bigfoot - or aliens . But all of this ... Instead of waiting for them to come to us ... We 've been going to them ! You have that skull - isn 't that enough evidence ? Only that they once existed I want to prove that they exist now ! We need something more concrete ! - Something ... - ... that can 't be debated . Exactly ! How dangerous are they ? Well , I should imagine that they 're only dangerous when their space is invaded which is exactly what we 're doing now . No ! They 're not any more dangerous than any other animal in the wild . The fact of the matter , students is that I can 't do this without you . You see , if I had chosen assistants from Academia , they 'd have wanted to share in all the glory . But you as students , well , You 're just as smart as they are , but there 's no chance that any of you will outshine me . No offence , of course . - Oh , now , this is bullshit . - This is wrong . Professor you realize what 's going to happen when someone finds out ? I mean , you 're treating us like prisoners ! Like we 're your lab rats ! By the end of this , you won 't be telling anyone . You 'll be so enthused with the discovery and the knowledge that you 'll barely remember my " little persuasions . " Enough ! It 's time we all got some rest . Don 't you think ? This is so messed up . Sydney was right . About all the other people missing . I don 't even want to think about what happened to them . I 'll get the gun . Tonight ? After everyone 's asleep . I 'll get the gun . - Me too . - No . It 's got to be quick . It 's got to be quiet . It will be easier if it 's just me . Or me . I mean , it could just be me . Greg ... Look . If it 's you , and something happens I 'm not strong enough to carry Josh . Well , don 't worry about me . Don 't make it about me . I 'm not . But , what would it happen ? We can 't ... Look , I 'm just saying , okay ? Just in case - that 's all . That 's why it 's got to be me . Well , scream or something if anything happens . Ah , yeah . Thanks . Nice touch , Greg . Guys , if it gets really serious , we can always use this . Look . It 's like Morse code . S.O.S. Without the dots . See ? Batman 's got one - quite similar . Seth ? - Hey . - Hey . Do you mind if I stay here with you tonight ? Dani 's with Greg and I just didn 't want to be alone tonight . No - I mean - yeah , that 's fine . Thanks I just don 't think any of us should be alone tonight , you know ? Yeah Thank you . Tonight - those noises . What do you think they were doing ? I don 't know . Might be like another warning . Maybe like some sort of call to arms , or something . It could be anything . It 's probably nothing . We don 't even know what we 're really dealing with . Not scared , are you ? No . No , I 'm not scared . Good Well , I am . Are you going to get the gun ? Now 's as good a time as any . Do you think they 're asleep ? No . We should probably wait . I 'm glad you got such a big ... tent . I usually plan ahead for two . Such an idiot . Are you okay , Josh ? Why can 't I just pitch my own tent ? You know what I mean . I 'm not letting you go anywhere . I 'd be fine with it . Really . I just keep thinking about Sydney and how that I mean , who 's to say they didn 't ... What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's the rain . It is not my foot . That 's gross , Josh - stick it outside . That rain is urine . You 're kidding me . Come on , Greg . It 's true . Some animals piss on their prey . Wicked ! Watch out , Josh . They 're mocking you . Yeah - out of ten , I get eleven . ( Josh screams ) Josh ! - Guys , Josh is gone ! - What ? They took him ! What about Greg ? He 's gone after him ! Get him alive - I want one . ( Josh screaming ) Josh ! Josh ! Help me ! Help me ! Josh , I can 't see you ! Oh , my God ! Josh , where are you ? ! Josh ! Josh ! ( growling ) ( Josh screams ) Josh ! Josh ! Josh ? Josh ? ( screams ) Josh ! Josh ! Josh ! What the hell ? ! Ow ! My ... Oh ! Why did you shoot me ? Oh God ! Oh God , it hurts . Why me ? Why did you shoot me ? Ow ! Ah ! Why ? What 's wrong with you ? Why ? What are you doing ? ! Why ? ! Ah ! Oh ! Why ? Ow ! No ! No ! Help me ! Help me ! Oh , help ! God , Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! I have to go help ! No ! I have to go ! ( growling ) - What are you doing ? - I have to go help ! - Don 't leave us ! - I have to go ! I 'll be right back ! No ! No ! Come on . Come on . God . You will not go to them ! It hurts . Please . Oh God ! God . Help ! Help ! Oh God ! Chenne ? ! Chenne ! AAAAHHHH ! Oh God ! Chenne ! Chenne ! Chenne ? ! You used us all as bait . This place - you knew how dangerous it was here and still you told us to come . You must understand . No - I don 't . You are so young . - You have a lot to learn . - About what ? Desperation ? Insanity , failure ? Failure ? I am just about to succeed . Do you realize what 's being discovered here ? What 's being discovered ? ! They 're killing us ! You 're killing us . You think they 're just gonna let us walk out of here so you can put them in a cage with a big sign around them ? I expected some casualties . Everyone understands sacrifice . Do they ? ! Well , we 'll see about that when I get back and I explain to everyone how you sacrificed a 20 year old girl for your precious discovery . You get that ? Yeah , I get it . ( beeping ) ( beeping faster ) - Listen . - What ! Someone 's coming . - Greg ? - Seth ? Ah ! Wonderful . - Where is Seth ? - Where is Greg ? Where is Seth ? Gone . Everybody 's gone . Oh , Seth . It is on ? Can we go ? Yeah . Tonight , our expedition , led by me - Conrad Hamilton , was attacked by a new breed - an intelligent species that has so far killed at least five of our members . We are being stalked - hunted , toyed with - but we stand resolved . Tomorrow we begin again . Three of us remain - and three of us will continue ... - Wait , what ? You can 't be serious . Yes , of course ! We 're so close to achieving our dream ! Our dream ? ! We have to get out of here now ! No ! You will not ! Keep on recording ! The three of us will continue our quest to find this new breed - And we will endeavour to bring back evidence to the outside world that these incredible creatures exist ! She should be right around here . Who ? Your friend Sydney . What is that thing ? A tracking device . What ? Are you serious ? Someone knows we 're here ? Don 't get excited . We 're the ones doing the tracking . Sydney shouldn 't be too far off now . Why aren 't you recording this ? ! What is the camera for ? ! Record it ! We are close - very close ! Did you plant the device on one of them ? One of them ? ! No - on all of you ! What ? I can 't believe you ! They got ahold of Sydney , didn 't they ? And you let them ! How could you ? ! Science ! That 's how I could - that 's why I did ! She should be right around ... Ah ! Aaah ! Go . Go . Take this . I can 't . Yes , you can ! They did it . They did this ! This is beyond intelligence . This is imagination ! And they are my discovery . Mine ! Professor Con ... Good . Right - Let 's go ! He was tracking something . It was Sydney 's tag . He needed it to get them to come to him . Okay , let 's go . It 's that way to camp . And from there , we look for bread crumbs . We 've got about three hours of good sun left . Are you guys with me ? - Get me out of here , please . - Let 's go . Did you guys pack up camp ? No ! They had to have taken it ! Okay ! Okay ! Come On ! It 's okay ... keep moving , keep moving ... go ! Come on , let 's go ! There was one here . One right here - I remember it - right here ! - Are you sure ? - Yes , I 'm sure ! If you remember it , then we must be on the right track , right ? Right ? ! Right . This way . What happened if they found them ? Let 's just keep moving , okay ? Let 's move ! Move ! ( growling ) Move ! Move ! Move ! I think this is another place ... Where 's Dani ? No ! The camera . Run ! Run ! Run ! Stop . Wait . ( roar ) ( growl ) ( scream ) Run ! Seth ! Seth , come on . - Move . Let 's go . - Okay . Come on . Josh 's light ? He might still be alive . Come on ! I don 't like this place . - I could be a trap . - We don 't have a choice - come on . No ! Have you got the night vision on ? Yes , got it . Got it . Turn left . Turn left . Go straight . Okay . Okay . What 's that echo ? A huge cave . Josh - can you see Josh ? He 's not here . Okay , we need to get out of here . Seth , there was something there . What ? Give me the camera . They 're here . They know . They 're in here . There 's nothing . Nothing . Seth ! ( Seth screams ) No ! No ! No !

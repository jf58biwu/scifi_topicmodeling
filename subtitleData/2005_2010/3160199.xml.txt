 Previously On Journeyman I can 't control when i go . I seem to come back to the present when i finish some chapter in the lives of the people that i 'm tracking . Who 's the lucky woman who got my fianc ? So if it feels like a dream , then maybe it 's something you 're doing to yourself . The mri didn 't find anything , but maybe it 's something else . Katie , i 'm going back . I can feel it . Katie ? Yeah . Jack 's katie ? Did he tell you he saw livia ? It 's interesting . Don 't you think that whatever he 's doing takes him right back to her ? What happens if you 're traveling and you die ? Do you come back dead ? I 'm not gonna die . I 'm doing some research . On what ? Tachyons . Tachyons ? Particles that travel faster than the speed of light . Katie ... Olivia knows what you do . Livia does what i do . Welcome back . I 'm not trying to break you and katie up , dan . You 're doing fine by yourself . Where you been ? What is that in your pocket ? And i 'm not in the mood for a punch line . Don 't worry . It 's ... You can 't keep going on like this , katie . It 's complicated , jack . What else ? Oh , we need lemongrass and artichokes and heirloom tomatoes . Lemongrass ? Yeah , i know . Mom 's decided that we can 't eat anything out of boxes or tubes anymore . What about ice cream sandwiches ? She stops those , we 're moving out . Sorry . Hey , look . Who 's he with ? Doesn 't matter . It 's jack . She 'll be somebody else next week . Hey , jack . Hey . What are you doing here ? Apparently , my diet 's lethal . Too many donuts , that it ? Time to let the holster out ? Oh , sorry . Theresa sanchez , this is katie , dan . Hi . Nice to meet you up there . Jack talks about you all the time . Oh , really ? Well ... So , how 'd you guys meet ? In the er . I 'm stitching a guy up while he 's taking a statement . Dream date . You know me . I 'm all about the romance . Oh , yeah , yeah . Cheese guy 's here . Oh , i love him . Oh , so cheese is okay , just not cheesecake ? Awesome . Cool . How do they do that ? Practice , buddy . Can you do that ? No . Zack , listen to me . We got to go , all right ? Not yet ! We got to find mom , all right ? Got to find mom . Dad , my hat ! Dad ? Dad ? Dad ? My god . You are awful ! Jack , you seen dan ? No . He was just here . He 's pretty good at evaporating these days . Yeah . Zack 's with him . I can 't reach him on my cell . Take it easy . How far could he have gone ? I don 't know . Do you have any idea where they were heading ? No . I think zack might be separated from his father . Hey , it 's vasser . I 'm at the corner of collingwood and market . I got a priority 807 . Don 't worry . We 'll find him . Is something going on ? Where 's my case ? Black plastic case ! You know where we are ? I don 't even know when we are . Katie ? Where is he ? Upstairs . Where 'd you go , dan ? I got sick . Vertigo or ... What , you fall into the bay ? Jack ... Why didn 't you call ? Jack , stop . Come on ! Lost his son in a public place , he can 't call his wife and tell her ? Look at him ! How can this be okay with you ? What the hell 's going on here ? Last week you had a handgun at a fundraiser . Jack , this is a family matter . Yeah , and he 's my brother . What the hell 's going on ? Jack ... Jack , we have a problem and it 's serious and it 's personal , and right now i just need you to trust me , okay ? Okay . Thank you . Wow , you , you 've made enabling an art form , kate . Dan ... We got careless , both of us . Zack was terrified . He just ... How do we do this ... With you just vanishing ? I don 't know . Right now , i just got to go and talk to zack , okay ? Yeah . Dan , clean up first . I 'm sorry about leaving you today . Where did you go ? I-i got sick . Got dizzy and i lost you in the crowd . I thought you could see over people . I can usually . What 's this , bud ? I 'm making a sign for the ' niners game so mom can see us on tv . All right , yeah . Want to help me ? I 'd love to . Tomorrow after work , all right ? Okay . Dan ... I bought the tickets six months ago . I promised him we 'd go together . Well , things are a little different now . I know , but this doesn 't seem like the time to tell him that we can 't go . He 's seven , kate . He 's not gonna understand any of this . Honestly , being seven might help . 15 % this quarter ? This month . Wait a minute . Down 1.5 points of circulation this month alone ? That 's a precipitous decline . Precipitous ? That 's a freefall , gentleman . John , what 's going on with the buyout of the senior reporters ? Everyone 's come forward . We 're pretty lean right now . We 're not lean enough . I see a whole lot of people running around out there . Yeah , doing their jobs . I don 't doubt that they are , hugh . But you don 't care . And any additional cutbacks will leave us open to age and discrimination lawsuits . Oh , yeah , and weaken the paper . Here we go . ? You got to like a guy who 's got the bag to hijack a plane and bail out with a hundred grand . No , you really don 't . So why you looking him up ? Story . You got something on him ? Maybe . 'Cause that 'd be huge . Dylan mccleen 's just the name he bught the tickets under . Nobody knows who he really is . I know that , jesse . You need any help ? What ? I 'm a floater . Research a tattoo for me : Lightning bolt , star on the left , sun on the right . See what you can find . You got it . This newspaper 's bleeding , hugh . Ad revenues are down 15 % for the year . Internet has decimated our classified section and we have some reporters here who only file a couple times a year . We 're not vanity fair . Newspapers are never profit machines , lane . You want to make money , invent a search engine . And that 1.5 is better than last quarter . Which means we 're pulling out of our dive . What about vasser ? What about him ? He works hard . And he 's expensive . Hey , you want to hurt this paper , get rid of dan vasser . I don 't want to hurt the newspaper . I want to keep it running . That 's an army ranger tattoo . You 're fast . 75th regiment . Do you really think that dylan mccleen was a ranger ? Could be . Well , they did long-range recon in vietnam , cambodia , and laos . Hasn 't every morsel been picked from that carcass ? Dan 's onto something new . Like what ? A lead . Who he was , or is . Really ? How much would you love that ? Quite a bit .

An avid sportsman , the president hopes to insure that america 's well-represented at the upcoming ... ? ? Can i come back ? Excuse me . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? How the hell do you keep finding me ?

I saw what you did out there . No one disappears that fast but us . Dylan ... That 's not my name . Why are you following me ? I have no idea . Who 's the guy in the picture ? You looking for him ? What ? You want money ? No . I want to help you . Why ? ! You follow me again ... Just gonna watch me get stabbed ? What do you want me to do , hurl myself onto his knife ? It doesn 't work like that . Where 's dad ? He 's working late , sweetie . He said he was gonna help me with the sign . I know he did , honey . He will . This new job of his , it 's real tough on him . On everybody . Who is it ? Sfpd . Sorry to disturb you , mrs . Vasser . Wilson hargraves , sfpd . Is everything okay ? We 're investigating a robbery at a liquor store the night of your fund-raiser . It 's a place a couple of blocks away . Hey , honey . Could you go upstairs and play for a few minutes ? Okay . Okay . Come on in . Thank you . Dylan mccleen . You haven 't heard of dylan mccleen ? He 's the guy who ... He hijacked a plane . I told you i haven 't . What 's your problem ? Sorry . I 've been on the road a lot . It 's taking its toll on the family . Tell me about it . Do you have a family ? No . Well , i do . I 've got a son . His name 's zack . That 's nice . I 'm doing a lousy job of raising him . I keep get sucked out of his life at all the wrong times . Right now he thinks that i don 't love him . So . See ? No secrets with me . That 's hard . I 'm sorry . Two hot dogs , two sodas , please . You worried that i won 't ble to handle that you have a husband and family ? No , dan . I know you can handle that . Why are you still here ? Why are you keeping an eye on me ? What are you doing here ? How are you gonna pay for lunch ? I thought so . It 's becoming a problem . I told you to buy old currency . It 's expensive . Katie checked it out . 95 ? It 's a miracle . Sticker shock . You were co-chair of the benefit at the museum ? Is that right ? That 's correct . I 'd love to see a guest list , if i could . I 'd rather not . We promise discretion to our donors . We promise to arrest people who commit armed robberies . Can i get that to you tomorrow ? You were at the event all night ? I was co-chair . Yes . And your husband ? He attended . You didn 't see anyone there with a gun , did you ? No . I never saw a gun , no . Okay . Well , um ... Listen , get me that list by tomorrow , if you can . Here 's my card . Well , i ... I really hope you get the guy . Oh , we have a half dozen witnesses , a cabbie who gave him a ride . A camera phone shot . I think we 'll find him . Can i ask you a qstion ? And i-i don 't mean to be flip . Sure . Did the owner of the store say it was a man in a tuxedo who robbed him ? I mean , isn 't that where you should start ? Well , the owner of the store was pistol-whipped within an inch of his life . He 's in a coma , so we can 't start there . You have a good night , mrs Vasser . Yeah . Look at me . Do you really think i 'd rob a liquor store ? No , but i didn 't think you 'd come armed to a black-tie fundraiser either . And people go to prison all the time for crimes they didn 't commit . ? Going be ok How 's zack ? He 's not great . Jack says he 'll take him to the game . You have to tell him that you 're not going , dan . I will . I 'll do it tonight . How s your day ? Fine . I think i got a story on dylan mccleen . - The hijacker ? - Yeah . You met him back there . Yeah . Can you imagine ? Uncovering the identity of dylan mccleen . It sounds like you 're enjoying yourself . It has its adrenaline moments , that 's all . And the livia part ? No . You 're an adrenaline guy , dan . You liked the action when you were gambling . Maybe - you want two women in different time zones . - Katie ... No , i mean , you know , technically , it wouldn 't be cheating if it 's in the pas I was sleeping with jack . Maybe you should sleep with livia back there . So if i 'm with livia back there , you can start sleeping with jack here , right ? What ? Not funny ? Honey , i 'd trade adrenaline rush for marital bliss any day . I know . Maybe if i just held onto y . We could try it . I 'm gonna go see zack . Okay . * johnny was a schoolboy * * when he heard his first beatles song * * love me do , " i think it was and from there * * it didn 't take him long * * got himself a guitar * * used to play every night * * now he 's in a rock ' n ' roll outfit * * and everything 's all right * * don 't you know . * * johnny told his mama , " hey , mama , i 'm going away * * gonna hit the big time , gonna be a big star someday * three dollars 'orth ?

Yeah , uh , let 's go somewhere we can talk . So ... How do you know my father ? I had just started at nasa . Your father was covering the shuttle prototype . You had questions about tachyons ? You know , i 'm pretty sure we ske on the phone once about ten , maybe 15 years ago . - Really ? - Yeah . Maybe i was looking for your father . Maybe . You have a very good memory , though . Look , i wasn 't entirely forthcoming . I 'm not doing a story on funding at stanford . Is that right ? It 's not something i ... Like people to know around here , but ... I 'm working on a book . It has a science fiction element . Time travel ? Yes . The rules haven 't changed much since einstein . Ultimately , whether it 's wormholes or warp drives , time travel requires you to go 186,000 miles per second . The speed of light . That 's the rub because so far nothing has demonstrated an ability to do that . What about tachyons ? Theoretical particles , never proven to exist . So time travel is impossible ? No , just not proven . 500 years ago , we knew pluto didn 't exist . Five years ago , we knew it was a planet . Now we know it 's not . Did pluto change ? No . Did our understanding of pluto ? Yes . You 're an expert , dr . Langley . Do you think time travel is possible ? Until you prove to me you can or can 't , i don 't know . How does your protagonist get around ? I ... Dabble in fiction myself . He just does . Actually , he wants to find a way to control it . Stop it . He claims to be falling through time randomly . Maybe a wormhole . How terribly inconvenient . Yeah . Any idea what might be doing that ? Spontaneous symmetry breakage . Perturbation in the local dark energy density . God . Are people taking advantage of him ? Not yet . They should ; a person wielding that kind of power would be very valuable . Right ? Yeah , yeah , i guess . I hope i 've been some help . You have . Yes . I should go . Let me know if you want to talk more about this . I will . Thank you . Do you validate ? Sadly , no . Well , then ... You 're good at this . You could do this for a living ? Can you get us on the field after the game ? I don 't know if i can do that , bud . Why ? I 'm not sure that i can go to the game . What ? I got to work . But uncle jack 's gonna take you . You promised . I knowl know , z . I got this big new project . I 'm sorry . I 'll be two seconds , okay ? Hello ? Not doing so well on captain rich . Wow , they said you were good . Okay , first of all , it 's special ops , so it 's t like there 's a facebook . And second , a first name would help . I 'll take anything , an address , medical record of any vet named captain rich living in san francisco in the ' 70s . I don 't care if he was a chaplain . Katie ... Katie ! Katie , i got to leave ! Katie ! Hey . Hey . Hey . Excuse me . Sorry . Dylan ! That sucks ? This assignment 's a bitch . They 're all a bitch . I just need a name . If i could only find mccleen 's real name , i could find him . What do you know about him ? He was special ops in cambodia during the vietnam war . I just need my laptop . Waitdan , listen . How did people survive back here ? - Dan . - What ? I know someone here you can talk to . A photojournalist covered the vietnam war . No . Why not ? I thought i wasn 't supposed to mess with things . You 're not . Just get what you need and get out of there . He won 't know you . Dan ... Let 's go visit your father . Vertigo ? That 's what he said . That 's usually inner ear problem . How 's his hearing ? - Dan 's ? - Yeah . I think he hears fine . He just doesn 't listen . Well , they seemed really nice . Katie 's beautiful . Oh , yeah , katie 's great . So , uh , how many dates are required for a full disclosure ? Normally , i 'd say 20 , but since you just brought it up ... I 'm gonna go with five . No , we 'll go with 20 . No , buddy , you don 't get to do that , open that door and then walk away . You were a woman . I 'm hurt that you could even consider that a possibility . I 'm a doctor . I know what 's possible . And you have delicate hands . I used to date katie . Like , once or twice ? For a couple years . There 's nothing between me and katie . And yet you felt the need to tell me that . Katie and i were over long before dan stepped in . Oh , this is too good . Hi . Hi , it 's nice to see you again . You , too . So i hope i 'm not interrupting . Actually , i have to get back to work . Oh , no , please , don 't go . I 'm just dropping something off . No , really , i do actually have to leave . It 's a hospital . We never close . Thanks for lunch . Got it . I 'll see you later . See you . Bye . Niners tickets . Thanks for helping out . Sure . So , uh , i got to go . There 's a thing at zack 's school . Okay .

He 's just doing his job . So , you didn 't send him ? No . This is his investigation . I 'm homicide . If the owner dies , you might see more of me . Jack , dan didn 't do it . So , uh , theresa . I like her . Yeah , she 's fun . But don 't get too comfortable . It might not last . Why ? You 'll laugh . What ? She doesn 't want to have kids . You live long enough ... Um , so , when did you have this epiphany ? Not too long ago . It 's time . I just need a fertile myrtle , and i 'm good to go . Someone who 'll order in chinese with you and watch south park ?

Sorry , ford 's in town . Got to get to the st . Francis . Take your pictures , meet deadline , then off to the washbag to decompress , right ? Do i know you ? Herb caen told me about you . Ten minutes . Five . You can 't dr a half a million tons of bombs on a country just ' cause it 's next to vietnam and not expect people to go crazy . Yeah , no kidding . We were over there when the khmer rouge rolled into phnom penh . Just teenage boys in red scarves yelling , waving guns around . It was , uh ... It was real ugly . How long were you there ? Four months . Had a hotel pool till a water buffalo died in it . Must have been hard on your family . Traveling comes with the job . You know , it puts a roof over their heads . There 's a soldier i 'm looking for . Army ranspecial ops guy . He was in cambodia around that time . A captain rich ? - You get a first name ? - No . Well , if i knew a captain rich , i doubt he 'd tell me he was special ops . Those guys don 't talk about what they did over there . Vasser ! - Yeah . - What ? Your wife 's on the phone . Yeah , you know , just , uh ... Ju tell her i 'm not going to make dinner . I got to go . Okay . Thank you . Man , you , uh , sure you don 't mean ritchie ? Sorry ? Captain john ritchie , went into cambodia . Worked on the ho chi minh trail . He got shot up over there . He was an army ranger . Where would i find him ? What 's going on ? Some broad just took a shot at ford at the st . Francis . Great . Thanks a lot . Do you know where this ritchie might be ? Where he always is . ?

Bird-dog him . Well , uh , the board is for vets . Only . Oh , come on , jesse . You must be a veteran of something . Sure , i could be . It 's a little misleading . Is it illegal ? No . It 's the kind of stuff I used to do as a blogger , but ... Look , are you going to be quoting anybody ? Cite them as a source ? Probably not . This is a big story . Don 't stop doing what got you hired . So , you 've got a hundred grand in walking-around money , and you drink in this dump . They track the serial numbers . Have to be careful where i spend it . Choung must have quite a family for you to want to spend the rest of your life on the fbi 's most wanted list . How do you know his name ? I 'm a reporter . Tell me why you 're looking for him . If I was gonna turn you in , I would have done it by now . I was wounded there . His family hid me , fed me . I promised him i 'd get him out . Couldn 't the government help you ? Nah . Everyone just wants to ... Forget . - Yeah , but hijacking a plane is ... - Cambodia 's imploding , man . People are getting slaughtered over there . I needed money , and a bake sale wasn 't gonna cut it . So choung didn 't know what you were doing . Hell , no . After i bailed out of the plane , they had a manhunt going for about six weeks . I laid low until they left . By the time i got to san francisco , choung was gone . Bably went to cambodia to try to get his family out by himself , which means ... They 're all dead .

 My name is Jane Vasco . I could use you on my team . I work for a secret government agency that hunts Neuros . People who can do dangerous things with their minds . On my first assignment ... something a little weird happened , okay , something really weird . Until I get some answers I 'm getting on with my life , doing my job ... stocking up on aspirin ... because I gotta tell ya , pain 's a bitch ! BOLNAR - 25 MILES FROM BUDAPEST , HUNGARY Wham , bam , thank you ma 'am . You try beating that , my jolly green friend . How do you keep doing that ? You win . Drinks on me . Don 't feel bad . You giving me a better fight than I 've had in a long time . - Thank you . - Cheers . - Blood in your eye . - Thanks , I think . Is there a storm coming I didn 't hear about ? No , no storm . Then , why are they locking the place down ? The beast of Bolnar walks from the eighth hour past noon to the ninth ... and pity anything which crosses its path , animal or man . My goat was first . Four years ago . No one believed me , they laughed at me . - They 're not laughing , now . - Dogs , horses , men . Sliced to ribbons and ripped in half by the beast . You 're kidding , right ? - Anybody tried hunting this thing down ? - Them that tried all died . It 's best to stay inside when it is the time of the beast . Come on , another game . Double or nothing . Yeah , you bet . Just a second . Connor . Yeah , I 'll be there in half an hour . Sorry , my friend . I have to give you a rain check . - Rain check ? - I have to leave . You can 't go . It 's the eighth hour . Right . Connor , the beast 'll kill you . I 'll be okay . No ! No ! PAINKILLER JANE 1x20 " THE BEAST OF BOLNAR " Subtitles subXpacio TusSeries Connor ? What happened ? ! Connor ! What happened ! - What happened ! - It almost got me ! It almost got me ! - What 's it ? - I don 't know , something . - Maybe it was the beast . - What beast ? What beast ? - The beast of Bolnar . - It 's okay ! - I got to go , now ! - It 's okay ! You 're gonna be okay ! Couldn 't find much on the beast of Bolnar , except a few references to a town legend . Similar to Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster . Animal mutilation , killings . But no proof . Hey , last night I had the mother of all tetanus shots . That 's proof enough for me . I 'm not saying I don 't believe you . As many horror movies as I 've seen ... - You 've gotta consider all possibilities . - Including a Neuro on the loose . Do we have reports of Neuro activity outside of North America ? I knew you were gonna ask that . No . The only known Neuros this side of the water are housed in this facility . It 's McBride . Get in here , thank you . I 'll keep checking but the local databases are pretty pathetic . You want facts , talk to people . The guys in that bar knew plenty . - Agent McBride . - Captain . One of my team was attacked last night , in town . It has the earmarks of Neuro activity . If it happened in town , it wasn 't a Neuro . Not one of ours , anyway . - All the inmates are accounted for ? - Yes , sir . Head counts are done on the hour since the administrative change . That will be all , thank you . All right , Connor , put some clothes on , I want you to show me where this happened . It 's mine . I don 't know if I hit it , didn 't take it down . Connor , try to find me a blood trail . Right . - Ever see him like that ? - Not even close . What is that ? - Looks like the claw mark of some animal . - Yeah , King Kong 's bigger brother . - What the hell could do that ? - Mark of the beast it is . Beware the eighth hour past noon . Have you seen this beast before ? No one who sees the beast lives to tell of it . Where does it come from ? Have you no eyes , woman ? The beast comes right out of hell . Yeah , but there 's got to be something that we ... Connor ? Find that blood trail ? Only my own . Welcome to Bolnar . New people in town tend to create a stir . I 'm constable Farkas . Andre McBride . - We 're U.S. Federal agents . - Really ? That 's a first . And what brings U.S. Federal agents all the way to our little town ? One of our colleagues was attacked last night . - Between eight and nine ? - Yeah . The beast of Bolnar . Trust me , I know how it sounds . You have to understand . Two different worlds . - And each has their own rules . - What 're you saying ? - You believe in this beast or not ? - I 'm saying ... that there are many things here that can 't be explained away with ... " Rational explanations " And the beast of Bolnar is one of those things ? You already know the answer to that , don 't you ? I know something attacked me last night . Who or what , I don 't know . There could be rational explanations that you are unaware of . Then I 'd be more than happy to hear them . Four years ago , the people of this town elected me , believing that I could help protect them . Actually , I haven 't been able to do that . So , if there 's a chance that we could help each other to meet that end , I 'd like to participate . You know the town , you know the people . We can use all the help we can get . That 's the last one . The square 's been sealed off . The streets have been cleared . Except us . If even a cockroach crosses my sensor perimeter , we 'll know about it . You 're all keyed into infra red just in case we need a heat signature . Lovely . You 're a bloody genius . Five minutes to 8 : 00 . Places . - I got the north end . - I 've got the south . Farkas , here . West end . We 're about to discover whether or not science can triumph over mythology . All right , Riley , what do you got ? Not a peep . Wish it would come out and get it over with . - Maybe it 's not coming out tonight . - The beast comes every night . - It 's 8 : 30 and I 've got nothing . - Keep going til 9 : 00 . If he only knows we 're out here ... With all this brilliant science ... We 're not talking about a he . We 're talking about an it . Still nothing . Looks like a wash . Farkas ? - What 's going on ? - Farkas , I 'm on my way ! There 's nothing on my screen ! - I can see him . Something 's got him . - What ? I can 't see it . Jane , be careful ! Hold your positions , we 're on our way . Check Vasco . She 's all right . Good . He 's not . No fingerprints , no fibers . It 's a good thing we stayed up all night . A good man 's dead and all we 've got is a lot of nothing . I 've checked my sensor array and transmitters over and over again . - Everything 's working perfectly . - Except that it didn 't . - How was our perimeter compromised , Riley ? - I can 't explain it . Farkas said this thing is an it , not a him . Ok , look , even if this thing is some kind of beast , it should give off body heat on infra red ... and anything that moves should set off a motion detector , right ? Only it didn 't . Why ? - I don 't have a clue . - You better get one , Riley . There 's one thing we know for sure , whatever this is , it kills . Whoa , whoa , check this out ! Boss . Does that mean the thing 's still here ? I don 't know , I can 't tell , ok ? I can 't zoom in any further . Jane ? Connor ? I have it calibrated for a UV 15 overlay . Ok , it should work . All right , you sonovabitch , where are you ? - Connor , anything ? - No ! Guys ! Footprints . How could something so tiny be so strong ? - Anything yet ? - Yes and no . Meaning what ? I know what didn 't kill constable Farkas . It wasn 't the wounds on his back or the beatings he took . Then what was it ? Farkas died from a complete shutdown of his central nervous system . And it was sudden as though someone just flipped a switch . Never seen anything like it . Can you confirm that this is the same thing that attacked Connor last night ? Not with absolute certainty but the wound patterns are identical . Boss ... Sorry , go . Got a preliminary analysis of the footprint . Trace electromagnetic energy in and out of it . - It wasn 't there before Farkas was killed . - Okay . So , it belonged to our killer . What 're we dealing with ? Based on the depth of the print , a female , five foot six and 110 pounds . The guy I talked to in the tavern ... said the beast first attacked four years ago . His goat . So we 're not talking about an ancient legend . We 're talking about a legend that started after Nico moved into the neighborhood . Hell of a coincidence , isn 't it ? And according to Newman , whatever killed Farkas attacked his central nervous system . You 're damn lucky to be alive . Riley , I want you to delve deeper on this footprint analysis . I 'm going to head back to Newman . I still think we 're missing something in the inmate population . You two get back to town and find the guy from the tavern . See what he remembers about this thing 's first kill . Could shed light on how this began and why . Let 's go . Find this . Sorry , I couldn 't come up with more answers for you . That 's all right . It 's to be expected in our line or work . Let me ask you something , doctor ... These detainees , you have been here for a while ... Have you encountered any conditions under which the effects of a chip could wear off ? Encountered it ? No . Is it possible ? - Like you said , in this line of work ... - No way to be sure . Yes , but look around you . Nico has over a thousand Neuros who are not using their powers . And they aren 't all living here in the section for model detainees . I assume these questions stem from the incident in Bolnar . Let me say this , agent McBride . We know that proximity is required for Neuro power to have any effect . And Bolnar is 25 miles away . The beast of Bolnar didn 't appear until after Nico was established ... and I do not believe in coincidences , doctor . Yeah , you 're right , of course . But you might have to consider the possibility ... that you 're not dealing with a Neuro but something altogether different . Well , if it isn 't the dart champion of Bolnar . - Lot of work I am doing . - This won 't take very long . Horvath , something happened to me the night I left the bar . I told you not to go , you went anyway . I remember you saying something about your goat ... being the first thing that was attacked by this " beast . " - Torn apart . - My name 's Jane . We know the beast is dangerous and we 'd like to help your town get rid of it . - Can 't get rid of it . - Why not ? - Curse of the gypsies . - Gypsies ? World war II , many gypsies died here . Gypsies cursed Bolnar and the beast came . World war II was 60 years ago . How come the beast only showed up four years ago ? I 'm not a gypsy . That 's loud . Church , next door is good , protection from the beast . You said your goat was the first thing attacked . Attacked goat , not person . No . The boy must learn . I said , the boy needs to learn . Thanks for your time , Horvath . Nice class of people you hang out with . He seemed like a good guy in the tavern . Guess that 's why they call it happy hour . Poor kid . Kind of reminds me of the old man . Minus the left hook . - What 've you got ? - Nothing . Horvath doesn 't know how or why it started . - Unless you buy the gypsy story . - I 'm listening . There 's some superstition about a gypsy curse but it doesn 't add up . Actually , Farkas thought it did . And something got past Riley 's sensors . I think I might have a way to track it ... using part of the UV frequency that revealed that footprint . Still , thing should 've had an infrared signature . Should have , but didn 't . - You sure this will work ? - Only one way to find out . - Is that it ? - Yeah , that 's it . A mile north of here . Moving twelve miles an hour . We move . You 're our eyes , kid . Got your eyes and my mojo . Riley , ETA . Two minutes . Understood . All right , remember we hit this thing as one . Hey , guys , do you see what I 'm seeing ? - Oh , yeah , I see it ! - We just don 't know what the hell it is . Hey , guys , do you see what I 'm seeing ? - Oh , yeah , I see it ! - We just don 't know what the hell it is . Jane , you 've got point . Connor , you move on my mark . 3 ... 2 ... Where 'd it go ? I don 't know . It was on my screen and I ... Jane ! Behind you ! Vasco ! - You okay ? - Yeah . But wouldn 't have been if whatever the hell that was didn 't show up . Any history of this thing saving anyone before Jane ? Not that I could find . And none of the people I spoke to could remember it happening before , either . Yesterday , it snapped her in half . Doesn 't make any sense . - Are you wearing perfume ? - What ? Pheromones . They 've been known to excite predators . Among others . Other than changing my clothes , I can 't think of ... anything that made yesterday any different than today . What kind of prison has frigging cats ? It 's therapeutic . It calms the inmates . Yeah , whatever happened to a good smack in the mouth ? - You okay ? - Yeah . - This remind you of anything ? - You don 't need a cut man in your corner ? What 's your point ? These scratches aren 't nearly as parallel and linear ... as the ones the beast left in town . Or that we saw on Connor and Farkas . What difference does it make ? The beast isn 't a cat . We don 't know what it is . Or isn 't . I 'd like to go back and speak to Horvath . Do it . Riley , anything on those footprints ? I 've got a pretty firm handle on the energy signature . If I can enhance it , I might be able to produce an image . Maybe something like a mug shot . - Sooner than later , Riley . - Of course . You looking for something ? Yes . I 'm just not sure what it is . I told you everything I know . I know you have . There 's just something here , something I 'm missing . I am sorry but I have no time for talking . I 've got work to do . If you just give me one more second ... Or not . Hi . Let me help you with those . Whoa . You 've got some muscles there . - I can do twenty push-ups . - Not bad . It 's more than I can do . - Are you ametican ? - American . - Sorry . My english is not so good . - I think your english is very good . - Where 'd you learn ? - At orphanage . - My name is Jane , what 's your name ? - Kristoff . Kristoff , it doesn 't have to be this way . If you want , I can help you . I have to go . How 's it going ? I 'll tell you in a second . I 'm trying to render an image out of this electrical signature . Fascinating . I 'm hungry , I 'm gonna render a sandwich . You want anything ? This 'll take a while . I 'll come with you . It doesn 't make any sense . How do you " render " a sandwich ? Yes ! - So much for turning over a new leaf . - It did , actually . Until last night they 'd always been safe inside . I 'd say you could call this a sign of forced entry . I 'll take interviews . They know me . All right , let 's check this body . Oh , god . It 's not cut off , either . It 's ripped . It saves your life one day , overkill the next . Think we 're affecting the pattern simply by looking for the killer ? I Wish I knew . I suppose we should find the rest of them . As much as I hate to pass that up , Horvath has a son . Someone needs to check up on him , let him know what 's happened ... See if he 's okay . All right , I 'll find the head myself . Kristoff ? Kristoff , it 's Jane . Kristoff ? Where are you ? Hi . - There 's something I have to tell you . - I 'm not allowed to talk to you . - Why not ? - The mister said . The mister ? Your father ? Told me never to call him that . - Why aren 't you supposed to talk to me ? - I don 't know . But if I talk to you , he will send me back to orphanage . Kristoff , listen to me . There 's something I have to tell you , something sad . The mister isn 't coming back . - Because I was bad ? - No , Kristoff , you 're not bad , he is bad . To do this to you . To hurt you . Do this to me because I was bad . Now he 's left me . He didn 't leave you . He died . I 'm so sorry . I 'm going back to orphanage , aren 't I ? I 'm not going to let anything bad happen to you . - Okay ? - You 'll go , too . Everybody goes and leaves . I won 't go until I 'm sure you 're taken care of . - Have you had breakfast today ? - No . I 'll go see what 's in the kitchen . Eggs , bacon and potatoes . That 's what I make the mister every morning . Well , you wash up and today I 'll make breakfast for you . Just trying to get you guys on the comm . I 've got positron emission tomography of the beast of Bolnar . Have a look . Given that you guys don 't believe in monsters , I ran it against the inmate population . Got a 91 percent match to one of them . Gabriella Flanagan . I don 't know what you want me to tell you . The truth ! I 've been telling you the truth . - Tell me . - I 've never hurt anyone in my whole life . If you don 't count robbing people blind . I 'm not saying I shouldn 't be here . I stole and that was wrong and I 'm paying for it . But you said people have been killed . I 'd never do that . There 's a town called Bolnar . You been there ? No . I never even heard of it . You were seen there . Can you explain that ? No , it 's a mistake . I 've been here for ten years . Lady , you 're gonna die here unless you tell us what we want to know . I don 't know anything . I don 't . Why won 't you believe me ? That 's the best damn liar I 've ever seen . Or she 's telling the truth . You saw that thing on Riley 's computer . It looks just like her . She 's a model detainee . Never caused any problems . How do you explain that ? Ok , seriously , boss , just give me ten more minutes with her . - No . - Please . No . Go find Dr. Newman and have her run every test in the book on her . All right . I don 't know what you 're expecting to find . Even if I did find something , Gabriella 's " talent " was that she could see through solid objects . - She didn 't tear people apart . - Yeah , I understand that . But if her power were somehow to mutate , change form . That 's a big " if . " Besides , Gabriella Flanagan is still chipped and the chip is functioning . You 're positive . Agent McBride , right now , this woman is no more a Neuro than you or I. Kristoff , breakfast is ready . - Vasco . - Jane , it 's Riley . You still at Horvath 's ? Yeah , I think I found something , too . Whatever this thing is , - ... it 's somehow connected to this place . - Jane , you 've gotta get out of there ! In a minute . Tell andre those aren 't claw marks . Listen to me ! The beast is on the move . And it 's heading right for you . In broad daylight ? Look , all I know is the beast is headed toward Horvath 's and it 's moving fast . Jane ! Jane ! Kristoff . Kristoff , wake up . Kristoff , wake up . Wake up ! Kristoff , it 's all right . May I see that ? There 's no doubt about it . - No doubt about what ? - I 've found the beast of Bolnar . You mean we found her , Gabriella Flanagan . Yes , and no . When Gabriella Flanagan came here ten years ago , she was pregnant . She had a child who was then transferred to an orphanage . - Kristoff . - I 've confirmed that with DNA . I 've also confirmed that the boy is a Neuro . Doc , what 're you saying ? That this freakazoid gene can be inherited ? It would appear to be . This is the first we 've seen it . That doesn 't make any sense , Gabriella 's ... Apparently , the inherited ability can be different from the mother . I don 't buy it . If that kid did all this , why does it look like her ? Right now , I can only give a best guess for you . - The boy ... - His name is Kristoff . Kristoff 's unconscious mind seems to have created an entity , a creature from the in , so to speak , that carried all of his rage . And there was a lot of that to go around . Kristoff was adopted at the age of five for little more than slave labor . He 's nine , right ? The beast of Bolnar appeared four years ago . Apparently , Kristoff didn 't even know what he was doing . The entity created itself during a specific portion ... of rem sleep which turns out to occur ... Between 8 : 00 p. m. and 9 : 00 . When the church bell sounded , it would wake him up ... or interrupt his rem sleep , like it did today . Think about it . You 're Kristoff , getting worked half to death ... by a man who offers zero comfort or warmth . - Deep down you 're mad as hell . - I still don 't get it . I mean , why does it look like his mother ? He shouldn 't even be able to remember her . Yes , he does . In his mind , she 's the only protector he 's ever known . Until you helped him . That 's why his monster saved you . So when the kid went to sleep again , why didn 't the monster show up ? Most of us only experience rem sleep once or twice per sleep cycle . The deepest level is usually the first . Son of the Neuro . It sounds like a horror movie . Although , sequels usually suck . There was this one though ... Riley , shut up . If this is true , then Neuro ability can spread through genetics , we could be in for one hell of a party . I 'm afraid that 's a strong possibility . If you 'll excuse me , I have a report to write up . It looks like the circus is gonna be in town for a long time . Look at the bright side . You will never be out of work . Trust me , boss , if we could take the last of these freaks off the planet , I 'd he happy to collect my unemployment check . You know what , if you 'll excuse me , there 's a freak that needs some attention . So , I 've spoken with the new director and it 's all arranged ... You 'll never have to go back to that orphanage . And you 'll stay with me ? Kristoff ... I can 't . I have my work to do . But I do know someone that can stay with you . And I 've spoken to her . And she 's missed you every day of your life . And , Kristoff , there 's nothing better than being with your mother . Go on , you 'll be okay . Will I see you again ? Of course .

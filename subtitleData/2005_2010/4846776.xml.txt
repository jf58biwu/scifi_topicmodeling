 So , no one has suffered any hallucinations for approximately 10 hours . - Is that correct ? - That is correct . Well , again , we apologize for ... the bad batch of halos , folks . But Flight Surgeon has assured us that by this time ... your bloodstreams should be free of psychotropics . We understand . Claire can 't assure them of anything , Mike . You know that . The caveat , of course , being ... that everyone 's biochemistry is different . So if any of you do experience further hallucinations ... in all likelihood they will be slight and of no cause for alarm . Roger that . Then what 's the final word on our science funding ? I second that question . Yeah . The lawyers and comptrollers are into it . We 'll figure out something to keep you guys working . Oh , that 's great , ' cause the nearest unemployment office ... is 30 million kilometers away . And I hear the lines are killer . So , dudes , I 'm glad you 're all back down from your trip ... - but we got a lot of work to do . - Roger that . Venus is only a week away , people . I need to see you busy . We 're on it . You guys heard the man . We 're all buying that the halos were the problem ? - Till proven otherwise . - Do you have a better explanation ? I don 't know . Do you ? No . But I 've got a backup in the head . Urine bypass valve on toilet 2 won 't open . Come on . I 'm an aerospace engineer , not a plumber . Funny , you look like a plumber . Aplumber who needs a shave . If I was a plumber , I 'd be making more money . Fine . Goss wants us busy , I 'll get busy . All right , Paula . You ready ? Two hours in the hyperbaric chamber , then an hour of physiotherapy . Let 's go . Well , it 's only three hours out of your day . We 're all gonna be working our asses off . So you could just ... sneak away and practice the lander and nobody would even notice . How are they doing ? I 'm seeing an occasional spike , but they 're all pretty stable . Think we sold them on the halos ? Pretty sure Ev believes it . Ted 's handling Donner . Just give me a few days where nothing happens . When do you tell them ? November 5 , day after the election . Why are you turning off the comm ? This is between you and me . The halos didn 't cause those hallucinations , and you know it . Nadia , Mission Control already explained what happened . I 've never worn my HALO , and I was hallucinating as bad as anyone . Ted , I 'm second-in-command . I need to know what 's going on . I need to know what I 'm doing ! What you 're doing , Nadia , is programming the Venus insertion burn . - Not if I 'm being lied to . - No one is lying to you . Now program the burn . And that 's a command . I suppose there 's a kind of comfort in following orders . All you have to do is exactly what you 're told to do . It 's effortless . It 's mindless . And it completely absolves you of any responsibility - unless you get a conscience . Well , frankly , I 'm a little freaked out . I mean , six years without a HALO ? It 's like jumping without a parachute . Prayers and pure thoughts are not gonna stop you from hittin ' the ground . It 's not the halos . If they were causing the hallucinations , you and Wass would 've seen something . That 's not true . I mean , listen , Zoe . I was one of those people that never got off on weed . So put yours back on . I 'm not allowed to . Rollie thinks they 're dangerous . But seriously , you guys have no idea how weird you all were . I 'm still weird , Jen . You know how I was telling you I 'm having strange dreams ? Well , we 're in a strange environment . We 're gonna have bad dreams . Dream - one dream . Over and over . So ? Donner 's been having it too . Eve said we had no choice but to leave them . - How the hell would she know ? - I 'm trying to tell you . She has freaky high clearance , complete access to the archives . - And she looked at everything ? - Yeah - telemetry , cockpit tapes , readings from the E.V.A. Packs . Donner , Sharon and Walker weren 't gonna make it . - I hate to admit it , but Goss was right . - Yeah , I don 't buy it . She just took a huge monkey off of our backs . Your back maybe . Nobody talked to me . What the hell is that supposed to mean ? She show you any proof ? - No , I believe her . - So why don 't they go public with it , huh ? Share it with the world ? That 'd make my life a lot easier . You and I both know they have their reasons . She flirt with you , Ted ? - She 's working you , Ted . I don 't trust her . Neither should you . Ah , the morning after . - Please don 't shout . - I 'd ask you how you are , but that 's kind of self-evident . - Hey , listen , about last night - the , uh , rule thing - Didn 't we already say too much last night ? Yeah , we did . I just wasn 't sure if you 'd remember any of it . Well , clearly you are a rule breaker and I am a rule follower . So - I have rules about all kinds of things - you know , taking out the garbage ... buying clothes - I have a rule about , you know , not wearing eyeliner under my eye ... because it makes me look like an albino goth whore . Yuh-huh . Do you see any eyeliner under my eye ? - No . - No . That is because it is a rule . You are free to , uh , break as many rules as you like . - And I am free to follow mine . Yeah . - Yeah ? - Okay . - Okay . Good morning . Oh , well , there he is . Dr. No-show . Well , you know , I 'm glad I didn 't show up . You guys look a mess . I tried calling you . You could 've - I don 't know - picked up . Jen , I know . I got pulled into a meeting , and I turned my " G " off . - I 'm sorry . - Well , you know , I do still have the costume . So I could always put it on . - Mmm . - Drop by your place . We could do a little trick-or-treating . Mmm . Except I don 't think you 're gonna feel like ... doing anything tonight after today . How so ? Okay , listen up ! You got 10 minutes to finish getting dressed , get down to the track . Run a 5K , assemble in the stands . Let 's go . Space is an unforgiving mistress . One mistake at the wrong time , you die . That 's the reason we have a chain of command . That 's the reason you follow orders . Now , Donner and Shaw are standing behind me today ... because they have learned this lesson . In a critical time , they did what they were ordered to do . And that is what we are gonna teach you to do now . - All gotta be about Mars . - For the next 12 hours - - Just let it go , brother . - All we want you to do is follow orders . We say run , you run . Push the red button , you push the red button . An order is an order . We say it , you do it . No questions , no comments . You will be evaluated solely on your capacity to obey . Is that clear ? Stand up . Excellent . Run another 5K , then report to the manual training facility . I think they 're trying to kill us , man . Oh ! Ajay , go to comm 6 . I need some private plumbing advice . - Never work with your mouth open . - That 's very funny . You didn 't have anything to do with the design of this thing , did you ? Subcontractor . They made a fortune . Uh , listen . Do you have any clue what 's going on ? I 'm not in the loop . - There 's a loop , though , right ? - Affirmative . Goss , Eve , Claire ... and I believe Rollie . - Yeah , this HALO thing 's ball cock . - Agreed . Any suggestions ? What would be our course of action , Maddux ? There 's nothing to do now but follow orders . That 's not very helpful . Everyone stand . Take a deep breath and hold it . You 're all stressed . You 're all tired . And now I want you to think . The task at hand is to simply duplicate a sequence of lit pads that 's presented to you . Follow the computer 's lead . Is that clear ? What happens if we screw up ? You just exhaled , Mr. Wassenfelder . Go out and run a 2K . A-Are you serious ? I 'm as serious as I can possibly be . Let 's go , Wass . Move it . Group , exhale . - Would anyone like to go first ? Candidate Barnes . Excellent . Monkey could do that , right ? We 're also testing your determination . You may find in your careers as astronauts ... that there are orders that you must obey that cause you distress . Regardless of pain , regardless of outcome , you must proceed . This test requires that you proceed . - That 's enough . - 2K , then report back . Candidate Schilling . - What was for lunch ? - Oh , roast turkey ... mashed potatoes , stuffing , cranberry sauce ... and pecan pie right out of the oven - in my head . Ah . - How 's plumbing ? - It 's uncooperative . Although it 's just busy work to keep our minds off other things . I talked toJen about our dream . Not the details , just that we were having it . And ? - She still believes it 's the halos . - Ajay doesn 't . He thinks , uh , they 're keeping something from us . So what do we do ? I don 't know . I don 't know what we can do . Just fix the toilet and follow orders . Should be easy for you . You 're a rule follower , right ? What 's that ? Is that your hallucination ? What is it ? Okay , you don 't have to tell me what it is . Can you tell me where it 's coming from ? Here . In this bay . Up there . Pod 4 . Uh , Flight , I 'm showing the storage pods being rotated . - You have it on the watch list . I 'm reporting . - Copy that . Thank you . Put the storage bay up . Donner and Barnes . Donner , whatever you 're doing in the storage bay , they 're watching . Copy that , Ajay . Can you stay on this comm with us ? We 're getting warm . It 's in there . Huh . Here , you try . That 's weird . Ajay , can you pull up ... the manifest for pod 4 ? I 'd like to know what the hell is in there . Yeah . Let me see what I can do . I don 't know what led them there , but they 're trying to get in . You have to do whatever it takes to stop them , Commander . Get their minds off it . - Put them to work . - Copy that . Heading down to the bay . He needs to handle Donner . He 'll try . Let 's clear the press gallery . I 'm going downstairs . - Did we just lap you ? - A couple times . Oh ! 12K in one day . Oh , it 's a miracle I 'm still breathing . There are no miracles . There 's only karma . Well , until a few weeks ago , my karma was living on rice and jelly ... just so I wouldn 't have to walk the three blocks to the store . So if I 'm not dead right now , it 's either a miracle or reincarnation . Taking orders is ass . For a chance at this mission , I 'm an order whore . Oh , space is the trade-off for free will , huh ? Well , if you believe in destiny , taking orders is free will . Oh , he 's too deep for me . Damn , girl . You know , you might want to pace yourself . We do have 2K to go . - Last night teach you nothin ' ? - Yeah . If you don 't mind the barfing and the hangover ... mixing painkillers and tequila is a quick way to lose five pounds . Look , I 'm serious . You 've been through a lot . You might want to go easy on yourself for half a minute . - More to life than this mission , you know ? - Not for me . Not anymore . Hey . I 'm sorry Goss put you through that this morning - the Mars business . Guess everybody seems to think that we did the right thing but me ... which seems kind of strange since I was actually there . For what it 's worth , I tried to find you last night , but you 'd already left the building . I had no motive in telling Ted first . Except my reputation for being difficult ? - He says you don 't believe me . - No . It 's nothing personal . If you have data , I 'd love to review it . But , uh , I was told we saw everything . There are certain classified materials that were withheld . I 'm not permitted to give you the reason why . And I 'm just supposed to take you at your word ? Yes . Eve , what exactly is it that you do here ? I understand you 're involved in astronaut selection for some reason . - But I 'm a little fuzzy on why . - I 'm employed by the Bertran Corporation . We have three trillion dollars invested in this mission . Trillion ? With a " T " ? Well , I guess you could make some money in oil back in the day , huh ? We 'll be deeply involved in mining rights throughout the solar system . My job is to protect our investment ... which means making sure we have the best astronauts on board . And although Goss may not agree ... I feel strongly that that includes both you and Ted . So , yes , I went in . I had to make sure you guys were clean . And you are . End of story . I followed Mike Goss 's order . So if that makes me clean in your eyes , that 's terrific . But my gut tells me that Walker and Lewis could 've made it and should 've made it . So until I see something that shows me different ... that 's what I 'm gonna believe . Pick it up ! - Stand up . Extend your arms in front of you . This is round two . For our final exercise , we 'll be testing your capacity to follow orders ... that bring distress to someone else . Candidates Sharma and Barnes , please drop your arms . Sharma at the console , Barnes in the chair opposite . Drop your arms and sit . It 's like the Milgram experiment . - I don 't know it . - 20th-century obedience-to-authority study . It was inspired by the Nazi atrocities in World War II . " I was only following orders . " Yeah , but in Milgram , the subjects faked the pain . This is more sadistic . Proceed , Mr. Sharma . - Zoe , I - Do it . Get it over . - But I - - Do it . The test requires that you proceed , Mr. Sharma . I can handle it , Ajay . This is what you have to do . - Hello , Princess . - Where 's Paula ? - With Mintz . - Finished . - Her bay ? - Empty . - The galley . - Nada . - Bathroom ? - Still not working . - Oh , the can is really important , dude . Paula . Check the lander . Is this how you unravel the mysteries of the universe ? Well , Einstein played the violin when he was stuck . I just like to annihilate mutants . Hey , careful with her thumb ! And my glasses ! So aggressive . - Pod 4 Pod 4 is surplus , medical and dried rations ... uh , circuit boards . - Little of everything . - I should be able to get into that . Yes , everyone should . It 's probably a glitch in the scanners . Did you guys try one of the other pods ? No . Now I 'm feeling a little stupid . - Donner ? - Yeah , Ajay ? All I 'm showing in pod 4 is surplus . In fact , it remained empty until the very last cargo delivery . Does it say who made the delivery ? Uh , according to the payload records , the Bertran Corporation . You want to tell me where you 're going , Donner ? We knew five years ago that Bertran was a major player in this mission . - Now you 're grasping at straws , Donner . - Okay . Let 's open up the pod , take a look . - There 's nothing but surplus in there . - Is that according to Eve ? - It 's on the manifest . Ask Paula . - I don 't have to ask Paula . We can open up the pod , and I can see for myself . Why are you being so bullheaded ? It 's classified , Donner . Classified . You know what that means ? I 'm not gonna open it until they tell me to . Now that 's all you 're gonna get from me . Whatever you got in there is endangering your crew . And you know that and I know that , whether you 're willing to say it out loud or not . A couple of us could 've died yesterday , and we deserve to know why . I like Eve . I was best man at the wedding , remember ? But she 's got you carrying a pretty heavy load right now ... and I think it 's about time you started sharing it . Screw the orders . Do what you know is right for the mission . Flight , that 's a NOAA warning . Solar Terrestrial Dispatch . Ship 's proton sensor panels are activating . Active region 106-niner-6 . Approaching central solar meridian . We are looking at a major X-class event . - Solar flare ! - Give me an E.T.A. To the ship . - Intercept , seven minutes . - This isn 't Beta . - No . We have substantial coronal mass ejection with intense proton activity , X-class , 2.3 . Antares , you have six minutes , 35 seconds to shut down and get to a radiation shelter . - This is a big one . - Copy that . - I 've got the lab . - Lander bay . - Flight deck . Already on it , Donner . But I could use some help . - Mintz ? - On it . Med bay is shutting down . - Wass , let 's go ! - Just putting dishes away in crew quarters . Closing the lab . Shutting down all nonessential circuits . - Okay , that 's the fire alarm . Everybody out . Remain calm . Follow me . Oh , God . I am so sorry . It 's all right . Come on . We gotta go . - Okay , this way ! Come on ! Single file ! Keep it moving . - People , let 's go ! - I don 't know which way to go . - Let 's go ! - Single file . This way . - The exit 's this way ! - No ! - The exit 's this way ! You 're taking us the wrong way ! Wass ! Straight ! Straight ! - This way ! Up the stairs ! - We should be going down ! Why are we going up ? - Keep moving . Single file . - Let 's go ! - Look out for one another . - Straight up . Straight up . - Faster ! Let 's go ! - All right . Head for the fire escape , then down to the street . One , two , three - Four minutes , Jen . You gotta go . Rufus . - Where 's Paula ? - Inside . Where 's Jen ? We left the lab together . She was right behind me . Jen , where are you ? - Jen , you copy ? - I 'm in the lab . I 'll be there . Just give me a minute . - We 're losing the comm . Let 's go . - Let me check on her . - No , no , no , no . There 's no time . - How much ? - Three minutes . - Piece of cake . - No , Zoe ! - I 'll make it , Donner ! Let 's go ! Radio blackout 's started . How long will it last ? A 2.3 X-class event could last a couple hours . There won 't be any communication with the ship until the flare radiation passes . - Are you picking up anything on their med bands ? - Negative . But you 're showing an elevated heart rate . I think we all are . Jen , what the hell are you doing ? It 's my gene samples . If I leave them in here , they will fry . We 've got 90 seconds to get to the bunker ! Let 's go ! - Come on , Jen ! - Zoe , I will get there . You go . - Damn it , Zoe . - Donner , the radiation has already killed the comm . It is building . We need to get inside and close this door now . - 50 seconds ! - Okay . Come on ! Come on ! - Forty . - If the comm 's out , we 're getting major rads now ! - Donner ! - It 's Zoe and Jen . Okay ? You want to give 'em a couple seconds ? - Whoa ! Jen , we have to find cover . Sure . Okay . - Get inside now ! - Twenty seconds . Come on , dude ! Get in here and close the door ! - Donner , please . - Donner ! Ten seconds ! - I cannot afford to lose you ! Get inside now . - Just - Donner , stop acting like an ASCAN . Get inside now ! What are their chances ? Depends on the event ... and if they were able to get under radiation blankets . They won 't die immediately . Oh , God . Sorry . How much you think we 're gettin ' now ? Well , the shield doesn 't provide us with much protection from a solar event . But the ... water and the polyurethane around us - We should be fine . Until 20 or 30 years from now when we all come down with cancer . Well , that 's the price we pay for doing what we do . - Hey . - Hey . - Thought you could use this . - Oh , thank you . You 're welcome . It 's been an hour and a half . Yeah . Shouldn 't be much longer . You know , we can 't give in to the fear . We got six more years of this . You don 't have to remind me . We just have to believe that they 're gonna come home to us . You know what I do every night ? What ? I clean my kitchen table . Jen hates it when I leave my stuff out on it . My wallet , my mail , " G , " whatever . - Drives her nuts . " A kitchen table is neutral territory , Rollie . You have an office . Use it . " So every night I collect my wallet and my " G " and my mail ... and I put it in my desk in my office . And then I wipe down the table ... just in caseJen comes walking through the door . Hmm . It 's goofy , I know , but it keeps me sane . No . Doesn 't sound goofy at all . Thanks . It 's big ... and long . NOAAprofile puts it close to theJanuary event in ' 36 . They 're gonna take some rads even in the shelter . - Shouldn 't be a problem . - If it was a one-time event . These guys are gonna be taking all kinds of radiation on a six-year mission . Every one of these is bad . Arnel , can you pull up the profile of thatJanuary ' 36 event ? Yeah . Let me ... dig around . Might take a few minutes . Schrodinger 's cat . Schrodinger 's cat ? What we are to Mission Control - alive and dead at the same time . Paula , it 's just basic quantum mechanics . You put a cat in a steel box ... along with a vial of hydrocyanic acid ... and a very small amount of radioactive material . I don 't think I want to hear this . If even a single atom ... of that radioactive material decays while the cat is inside the box ... a relay mechanism trips the hammer which breaks the vial ... and it 's curtains for kitty . The cat is dead . Yeah , but we don 't know that , because the box is closed . It 's only when we open the box and see the condition of the cat ... that the cat becomes one or the other , dead or alive . Clearly , we are alive . But Mission Control doesn 't know that because the comm is down . So to the world , we 're Schrodinger 's cat - dead and alive at the same time . What does that make Zoe and Jen ? That 's the all-clear . We 're starting to get data . Okay , let me know when the comm 's back up . I need to speak to the commander . - Still wanna look at that profile from ' 36 ? - You found it ? Put it up . It 's identical . Okay , you want to tell me what the hell 's going on ? - ... 18 , 19 , 20 . Fire escape . - ... 18 , 19 , 20 . Fire escape . 21 , 22 , 23 . Let 's go . Fire escape . 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 . - We got 28 . - 29 , 30 . What ? Zoe 's not here . What ? No , no , no , no ! Let 's go . Outside and down . Zoe 's not here and neither is Dr. Greer . The fire department 's on the way , all right ? Let 's go . Weston ! - Outside , right now ! - Give ' em a minute ! It 's Zoe , for God 's sake ! - Ted ? - I got it . - Zoe ! Dr. Greer ! - Jen , let 's go . Come on . - No . - Jen ! Jen . Jen , get back up here now . Zoe 's dead , Dr. Greer is dead , and you 're dead . Under different circumstances , we 'd all be dead . Sorry , Jen . Well - How bad was it ? This can 't be . - Donner . - Are you okay ? - Yeah ! - What the hell do you think you were doing ? No , Donner , we 're fine . The neutron detectors are reading zero . - What ? - You think that 's strange ? Wait till you see this . Yeah . Come on . Mission Control , this is Antares . Do you read ? Copy that , Commander . We read you loud and clear . Well , the neutron detectors are indicating no radiation at all . Zero . That 's right , Commander . Because what you and we in Mission Control just executed was an exercise . A drill . It 's based on the solar event of 2036 . I knew it . My astrophysics class in college did a case study on this . Goss used the same profile . - An exercise ? - Did you know ? No . - Commander , switch to comm 10 . You had no right to stage a drill without briefing me first . Well , you were losing control of your crew , Ted . I had no choice . I was not going to let them in . Well , that 's not the way it looked to me . Their attention had to be refocused , the chain of command reinforced . Do you copy ? Roger that . Now round up your crew and get back to work . - Venus is six days and counting . They need us in the science lab . We were under the blankets . We couldn 't see them , but we could hear them . - Dios mio . - Unbelievable . Dude . They 've gone fractal . Fractal is a geometric , right ? Like a shell . It 's a geometric shape that can be split into parts , each one a reduced copy of the whole . It 's - It 's infinitely complex and all around us ... everywhere in the universe . Uh , a galaxy is a fractal shape ... a hurricane , a wave , a shell ... ice , stock market . I guess tomatoes are . - No such thing as miracles , huh ? - What is going on ? - ... try to figure outjust how space and fractal - Kill the media feed . Rollie , enough of this . What 's happening up there ? Is this Beta ? - It wants them to know . - Not now . - My God . - Wow . It 's incredible . A solar flare didn 't do this . No , there was no solar flare . It was a drill staged to get Donner off my back - a distraction . Goss just told me . Distraction from what ? What 's he got hidden in the storage bay ? Mission Control , are you seeing this ? Uh , Roger that , Ted . We 're just ... a little speechless down here . We 're gonna be looking for some explanations down here . We 'll have people interface with Jen . They 'll come up with something . Yeah , well , some of us already have a pretty good idea of what caused this . I think it 's time the rest of the crew knew as well . He 's right , Mike . You know he 's right . That 's a negative , Commander . You will all return to your duties and execute this mission . That is an order . Well , my duty as commander of this ship is to protect the lives of my crew . A big part of that is them knowing exactly what this mission is . What exactly is the mission , Ted ? The answer 's in the storage bay . It 's in pod 4 . Talk to him . Now is not the time . Talk to him . Uh , Ted , honey , it 's me . Just ... um , breathe for a moment and think about what you 're doing . I 've been thinking about this every minute of every day for the last month , Eve . It 's a mistake . Trust me . - Yeah ? Well , you know what ? That ship has already sailed . - Ted , please . Commander , you will not enter that storage bay . I am ordering you to stand down ! - You will not - Oh , my God . What the hell is that ? Beta . It 's singing . - Sounds like a whale song . It 's beautiful . It 's been said that the capacity to blindly follow orders ... is what turns ordinary people into monsters - We have to stop them . There 's nothing we can do . Or ordinary people into heroes . All depends on exactly what the order is . Shut down all power to the storage bay . And that 's the catch , because we 're all responsible for who we pick to lead ... and who we choose to follow . Sir , the storage bay 's not responding . Try the main bus . Whether we give orders or take them - Negative , sir . It won 't shut down . I 'll see what I can do . We all contribute to the outcome . Commander , you have got to take control of your crew . Have them report to the observation deck at once . The responsibility falls on all of our shoulders . No matter who 's giving the orders and who 's taking them ... sooner or later we all have to answer to a higher power . Mmm . Ahh .

 heroes ( Indian man ) Where does it come from , this quest ? This need to solve life 's mysteries , when the simplest of questions can never be answered . Why are we here ? What is the soul ? Why do we dream ? Perhaps we 'd be better off not looking at all . Not doubting , not yearning . That 's not human nature . Not the human heart . That is not why we are here . ( woman ) How 's he doing ? [ faint siren ] I 'm sorry . Did I scare you ? No . No , I just , uh , I keep having these amazing dreams every time I close my eyes , and ... Never mind , um ... He likes me to read him the stock page . He 's even conscious at all ? No . Been a week now . I think he 's close . A couple more days , maybe . You know , I don 't know what he 'd do without you . You got a real gift . Just doing my job . No . You 're like a son to him . Well , then , that would make us like brother and sister . Might be a little awkward if I ever wanted to ask you out . [ chuckles ] I 'm sorry . That was , uh , that was inappropriate . No , it--it 's sweet . It 's- - I 'm dating somebody , and- - Yeah , no , really . It 's ... okay . I need to change his IV . I 'm sorry . No . Of course . Man is a narcissistic species by nature . We have colonized the four corners of our tiny planet . But we are not the pinnacle of so-called evolution . That honor belongs to the lowly cockroach . Capable of living for months without food . Remaining alive headless for weeks at a time . Resistant to radiation . If God has indeed created himself in his own image , then I submit to you that God is a cockroach . [ scattered chuckles ] They say that man uses only a tenth of his brain power . Another percent , and we might actually be worthy of God 's image . Unless , of course , that day has already arrived . The Human Genome Project has discovered that tiny variations in man 's genetic code are taking place at increasingly rapid rates . Teleportation , levitation , tissue regeneration . Is this outside the realm of possibility ? Or is man entering a new gateway to evolution ? Is he finally standing at the threshold to true human potential ? I 'm sorry , I 'm out of time . I know , I know . I 'm beginning to sound like my father . I can 't help it . You know , they can fire me too , if they like . But there is something to it , Nirad . As crazy as it sounds . What is it ? It 's ... your father . He 's dead . How ? Driving a taxi in New York City is a very dangerous job . The wrong fare , the wrong time . We may never know what really happened . No , I spoke to him two days ago . He was convinced someone was following him , trying to steal his research . He died because of his his theories . That 's crazy . Is it ? The man left his family , discredited his career to chase wild theories halfway around the world ! Where are you going ? To his apartment , to get his papers , his research . He was this close to finding the first of " them . " His Patient Zero . He tracked him to Queens , New York . Mohinder , listen to me . Your father was my colleague and my friend . A respected professor , a brilliant geneticist . But he had clearly lost touch with reality . I followed in his footsteps . My thesis is based on his research ! Yes , you always wanted his approval ! And now you 're telling me that it was all for nothing . I 'm telling you to let go . I need to know why he died . I need to know that it wasn 't all for nothing . And then I need to finish what he started . [ thunder ] [ cell phone rings ] Hello ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm at his place now . No , no , no . He left everything behind but his computer . Research , the map . Yeah , let 's get a team in here to bag and tag everything . I gotta call you right back . [ Wilson Pickett 's Mustang Sally ] * Mustang Sally * * Guess you better slow your Mustang down * * Mustang Sally , baby * * I guess you better slow your Mustang down * * You been runnin all over town * * I guess I better put your big feet on the ground * * Oh , yes , I will * * All you wanna do is ride around , Sally * * Ride , Sally , ride * * Pervert . * All you wanna do is- - * * [ beep ] [ indistinct whispering ] Time to get up , Micah . [ locks door ] Micah ? [ sighs ] Micah ! Micah ? Micah ! What ? Damn it , Micah , don 't do that to me . Do what ? You need to be careful . All right ? I 'm just working on my computer . The logic board was bad . So I had to build a new one . A new one . [ chuckles ] Did anyone ever tell you you 're the smartest little man on the planet ? You do . All the time . What 's this ? It 's a pinhole camera . It 's for the eclipse . The moon 's gonna cover up the sun today . We 're supposed to look at it at school . Speaking of which ... You need to go get ready . We can 't be late . Not today . Mom , I 'm already dressed , and I 've packed my own lunch . That 's what I 've been doing this morning . What about you ? Hey , don 't get smart with me . All right , I 've been working to pay our bills . Yeah , that 's why they turned off our gas again ? [ doorbell rings ] Go grab your stuff and wait by the back door , okay ? Why ? Just do it . [ doorbell rings ] Mom , what 's going on ? Never mind , just keep your voice down and stay close to me . [ pounding on door ] [ tires screech ] Camera ready ? ( boy ) Yeah , almost . Hold on . This looks like 70 , 80 feet . This is so unreal . ( girl ) Okay , I 'm good ! ( boy ) Okay . Aah ! Oh , my- - [ thud ] Oh , my God ! Oh , my God . Claire ! [ feet pounding , breathing hard ] Oh , my God . Claire ! [ crack ] Uhh ! [ breathing hard ] This is Claire Bennett . And that was attempt number six . You get out here , yes ? Mr. Linderman , I 'm gonna have to call you back in five minutes , okay ? Thank you . I 'm late- - I 've got a fundraiser and a drinks meeting . It happened two more times . Sometimes I 'm falling . Sometimes I 'm flying . Sometimes you 're in ' em . I don 't have time for this now . They 're not just dreams , Nathan . Hold this . I thought they 'd go away , but they 're not . Tim , I need this back by 6 : 00 , please . This morning , when I got out of bed , my foot hovered before it hit the ground . Hovered for a split second . Like I was- - like I was floating . I 'm telling you , buddy , I think I can fly . These all undecideds ? Mm-hmm . Tell you what , you think you can fly , why don 't you jump off the Brooklyn Bridge ? See what happens . Maybe I ought to start with something a little lower first . It 's like learning to walk . You 're serious ? Oh , I 'm serious . You need to snap out of it , Peter . See a doctor . Get some drugs . But do not pull a Roger Clinton on me , man . I 'm eight points down in the polls . This isn 't about you , all right ? Something is happening to me , and I have this feeling that you 're the only person that 's gonna understand this . Why the hell would I understand that you think you can fly ? [ cell phone ringing ] Because you 're my brother . [ ring ] Mom , I can 't talk- - What ? I 'll be there in 10 minutes . What 'd she do now ? She got arrested . Arrested for what ? Shoplifting . I 'm so depressed . What ? What are you talking about ? Why ? ( on tape ) You ready ? ( on tape ) Yeah , I 'm good . All right , besides the fact that it was so gross I almost fudged myself , this is the single coolest thing to happen to this town in , like , 100 years . Not if nobody finds out , it 's not . ( Zach , on tape ) Claire ! Why 'd you want me to tape you ? I have my reasons . It 's not like you 're not gonna be popular anymore . Popular ? Who said anything about being popular ? My life as I know it is over , okay ? I 've got the Bishop game next week , SAT 's in October , homecoming 's three weeks from today , and I 'm a freak show ! You 're being a little dramatic , don 't you think ? No , I don 't think ! I have busted , like , every bone in my body , stabbed myself in the chest , I 've shoved a two-foot steel rod through my neck , and I don 't have a scratch on me ! Wh--what do you call that thing sticking out ? Ugh . Great . Just give me the tape , okay ? Sure . [ snapping fingers ] Hey , I--I can give you a ride on my handle bars , if you want . [ sighs ] Look ... thanks , okay ? I 'll talk to you in front of people at school tomorrow . Promise . [ Wilson Pickett 's Mustang Sally ] * * * Mustang Sally * * * ( man ) Your son is a very intelligent boy . Gifted , actually . That 's not the issue . His father 's not around , and ... Sometimes I think he could use a bit of a stronger hand , you know ? [ chuckles ] I work nights a lot , but , um ... we can both work harder . It 's not about the work . The truth is , I just don 't know if this school is the right fit for him . But he 's made friends . I 'm sorry . He 's on the soccer team . I 'm sorry . I wrote a check for $ 25,000 to get him into this snob-fest . I was told that 's what it took . That 's on top of the tuition . [ clears throat ] About the tuition . Uh , your last three checks have bounced . Fine , take it out of the 25 grand that I gave you . That was a donation . And it was very appreciated . Well , I want my money back . I want my money back ... now . That money went to the capital campaign for the new wing . It 's already been spent . Then un-spend it . I 'm sorry . We can maybe discuss an extension of the money that you owe , but I don 't- - I want my money back . [ hissing ] That 's ... not ... possible . Come on , baby , let 's get out of here . We 're too good for this lousy school . Mom ? Leave me alone . For God 's sakes , Ma . [ kiss ] Are you okay ? They dropped the charges . I have to fill out a form . No big deal . No big deal ? I 'm running for Congress . Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to me if it gets out , with our family 's past ? What could you possibly need so bad that you had to steal it ? Never mind . I don 't wanna know . Socks . Socks . Dad left you a fortune . What are you thinking ? You know , it 's been one ridiculous stunt after another with you for the last six months . Dad 's gone . Just get over it . You know what ? Leave her alone . She 's okay . That 's all that matters . I gotta get this out of the press . You know what ? Just get out of here . Go worry about your image . I 'll handle this . Yeah . Good . I gotta make sure this stays buried . Thanks a lot , Mom . Mm-hmm . What were you thinking ? I just wanted to feel alive again . Nathan only cares about himself . Your father was the same way . Alpha dogs , both of them . You , in the meantime , for all your selflessness in ... sitting with dying people ... What ? You gonna retire on what you make ? Maybe I 'll shoplift my socks . Don 't get smart . When you put everyone else first , you end up last . You always put Nathan first . He took advantage . Yeah , it wasn 't you that was just pushing him right out in front of me ? He takes up more space than you . Demanded more attention . And besides , it 's not my fault you allowed it . He 's my brother . I love him . Oh , gah . Love is overrated . And he loves me too . I know it . We 've always been close . Rose-colored glasses . That 's cruel , Mom . Look , since Dad died , I know you 've been feeling free to speak your mind . But it wouldn 't hurt to edit yourself every once in a while . I 'm sorry if the truth hurts . I 'm just saying you hero-worshipped him . And those feelings were never returned . You 're wrong . It 's biological , and I can 't help it . We 're ... we 're connected . I never told you this , but when Nathan had his accident , I knew it . We all got the same call . No , I 'm saying before the call . Like he was telling me , 300 miles away . I woke up , and I knew that he 'd been hurt . I hate it here . She doesn 't even have any books to read . Baby , I 'll be right back . I 'm just gonna go and pack up a few things . We should really go see Dad . What good would that do ? He could help . He should know that someone 's trying to hurt us . Your dad 's not in any position to help us right now . Look , I made some mistakes . [ doorbell rings ] I admit it . Mom , what 'd you do ? Hey ... I need you to know that I would never let anything happen to you . I promise . Mom , why 'd you look at yourself like that in the fish tank ? [ door opens ] [ sighs ] How long ? Just a couple hours , tops . There 's some ice cream in the fridge . | | Go ahead . What happened ? I went to see Linderman . How much ? 30 . You gambling again ? No , it 's just bills . I use the rest to get Micah into private school . They don 't know what to do with him at public , and ... it 's just I needed them to think that we had money . From the mob ? I mean ... Hell , Niki . You weren 't born yesterday . It 's just two weeks overdue . I mean , I thought that I could handle it , okay ? Just , I 'm under a lot of stress right now . Gee , I wonder why . I feel like I 'm kind of losing it a little bit . [ whispering ] I 'm seeing things . Like ... Like I keep feeling like someone 's watching me . Yeah ! Linderman wants his money back , so he sent some mouth breather that 's gonna put you in the hospital . No , it is someone else . It 's someone that I can 't see . Does this make any sense to you ? No . I 'm sorry . You know what ? But I 'll tell you what does- - I shouldn 't be telling you this . No , let me tell you what does make sense . You need to come up with that 30 grand , plus interest , now . Or you gotta run . Watch him . All right ? [ men shouting ] [ siren ] ( firefighter ) More pressure ! [ shouting and sirens ] That is cool , huh ? How hot do you think it is in there ? Turn on the camera . [ coughing ] Scotty ! Scotty ! Come on ! [ man coughing ] ( firefighter ) Take it easy . I 'm okay . You 're all right . I 'm fine ! Take it easy . Take it easy . There 's no burns . Hey , Joey ! ( firefighter ) 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , go ! 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , go ! 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , go ! 1 , 2 , 3 ... ( super ) Yeah , I was real sorry to hear about your father . He seemed like a good guy . Man . I thought I was a slob . They were here , too . What ? Nothing . I got a guy who can clean this up for 100 bucks . No , it 's all right . I 'll take it as it is . We rent by the week . I 'm gonna need to know you can afford it . I have a job . Doing what ? Driving a taxi . I 'll get you an application . [ door closes ] ( TV announcer ) In these uncertain times , the people of New York need a leader with real world experience to selfless dedication . Nathan Petrelli . He served his country in Bosnia in the Army . As District Attorney , he 'll put criminals behind bars and establish new laws . ( Simone ) Hey . Oh , God , what ? The silent treatment ? Oh , boy . Isaac ... what are you doing ? What the hell is wrong with you ? Isaac ! Okay , stop . What are you , crazy ? ( Isaac ) Clearly . I don 't even remember painting these . I was high , okay ? I lied to you . Damn it . I 've been chasing for a month . Well , then get yourself back into a program and make it stick this time . These are fantastic . No , they 're evil . What are you talking about ? What am I talking about ? Want to know what I 'm talking about ? You see this ? Suicide bombing in Israel . I painted it three weeks ago . Yeah , so ? So ... that 's this morning 's paper . Look at the number on the bus . This happened yesterday . [ chuckling ] Yesterday . Something 's wrong with me . We 'll get you help , Isaac . I 've tried that twice . There 's only one way left , and you know it . You can 't go cold turkey . Not alone . I mean , let me help you , please . No ! I love you . I 'll drag you down with me . I swear to God I will . Just leave me alone . Get out of here ! Okay . Now ! ( female reporter ) An unidentified Samaritan witnesses described as a young teenage girl ran into the flames and rescued the young lieutenant . Now , the train is registered to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , and there has been no official statement yet on what was in the cars . [ reporter continues , muffled ] ( Tom ) It wasn 't easy , Nathan , but consider it gone . I know I owe you big on this one , Tom . I 'm not gonna forget it . I won 't let you forget it . Thanks . Sure thing . Mom 's rap sheet is now officially buried . Only took half my political capital to pull if off . Why can 't she get herself a hobby like a normal person ? They were married for 41 years . It 's a plea for attention . She 's lonely . Give her some time , will you ? I don 't have time . I 've got eight days to make up ten points . I need all the help I can get , which is what I want to talk to you about . I want to offer you a job . A job . Yeah . I trust you . You 're good with people . I need a coordinator to help organize the volunteers , and you got nice guy instincts . I could use that . I 'm a shark , Pete . Everybody knows it . It 's starting to show up in the polls . I bring you on . It kind of reflects well on me . You know what I mean ? Yeah , all right , so I make you look good . That 's a new one . It makes me look like I put family first . I mean , I know that sounds self-serving , but this is for you , too , right ? You gotta think of your future . Why do you do that ? Do what ? Even try to make it look like this has something to do with me . You didn 't hear anything that I said earlier today , did you ? That bit about how you can fly ? Yeah , I did . I 'm gonna pretend for both our sakes you didn 't say anything like that . I 'm trying to do the right thing here . Look , I already have a job . Yeah , watching old people die . Now there 's a career . It 's not cute anymore , man . The dreamy kid sitting in the back of the classroom staring out the window . It 's time for you to grow up . Look , I cast a big shadow , Pete . I get it . Life isn 't fair . But there 's nothing I can do about that . I 'm trying to do the right thing by you here . Okay ? I don 't want your pity . Hey , corner of Center and Canal , please . Wow . Solar eclipse . Yeah . Yeah , I wonder if it 's gonna be total . Not here , no . In some other part of the world , yes . A global event .

Do you ever ... get the feeling like you were meant to do something extraordinary ? I 'm driving a cab you may have noticed . No , I 'm not talking about what you do . I 'm talking about who you are . I 'm talking about ... being special . Yes , we are all special . That 's not what I meant . Some individual , it is true , are more special . This is natural selection . It begins as a single individual born or hatched like every other member of their species . Anonymous . Seemingly ordinary . Except they 're not . They carry inside them the genetic code that will take their species to the next evolutionary rung . It 's destiny . [ Rogue Wave performing Eyes ] * * Hey !

And you stay still also . I 'm fine , Ok ? I 'm fine . Ready ? What 's on ? What happened ? That thing Cyborg It 's been tracking us for 6 months How did it find you ? How did you know Sarah ? We don 't live in a barn we close the door and we wipe our feet . They are alive . Are you the Fields ? Go to your room and lock the door What do you want ? I 'm here to help.Are you the Fields ? - Anne , call 911 - No , no , please Go get the girl back I need to get you outta here now.Someone 's coming . I 'm not here to rob you . Then put down the gun . You don 't understand you are in danger We need to go . Just stand there . We had a hit on a name on the list . Alpine Fields , it 's a family Everything is under control.We might be late though . Can you handle your dinner ? John , just put the alarm on Teenagers , huh ? Don 't move . Put the gun down . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? Tell me the truth . The truth . In the near future , A computer system called Skynet takes over the world It 's sent humanoid machines back in time To eliminate anyone who is a threat I have a target list.Your name 's on it A machine is coming to kill you . It found your house in the city , and now it 's coming here . And your house sitter is dead by the way . Call the police Tell them there 's a crazy woman in the house with a gun You . Stand over here with her . Okay , we 're going. now . Now . What about charles barkley ? no . Why would you keep a gun in the house ? For a situation like this . Or a bear . This wouldn 't work in a situation like this . Why didn 't you tell me ? Or a bear . Because I knew you 'd react like this , And this is not helping . Does your son know you kidnap people at gunpoint ? Yes . Then you know he 'll be prone to delinquency himself . Mom , I think it 's obvious she 's well beyond dr. phil . Hey , you know , this is none of your business . Sarah . Out ! Back to the cabin , now ! go , run , run ! I 'm sorry . You should keep that covered . It 's a st. jude 's medal. it 's my grandmother 's . It 's a target . Where 'd you get it ? One of them . Do I wanna know ? Not really . You sound so used to all this . You don 't get used to it . You live through it . You sound like david . We were outside a motel in elko when it found us . Dad emptied the mossberg into that thing . And then he went after it with a table lamp And a curtain rod . Just long enough for us to get out . She told us to call if it came back . Do you think david could be all right ? Anything 's possible . What ? Nothing . I just know that look . Your plan sucks . You can 't use metal for this . They hit eagle rock bunker with a bio-weapon That killed everybody inside . Only one person survived out of 200 . Now , we need her back here . Alive . Metal 's immune to disease , So we 're sending in metal , end of story . Tin cans are immune to disease But not immune to going bad and putting a bullet In the skull of a person out there who could save us from this plague . I 'll find the survivor . I 'll bring her back . Just hope like hell she can help us . Once exposed , there 's no way to know how long you 've got . Could be four hours till the symptoms hit . 20 before the bug kills you . This could be a one-way trip . We 're all on one-way trips . He 's not out there , you know . Your brother kyle . He 's gone , reese . Now either you learn to live with that , Or die from it . She 's sleeping now . So you wanna tell me how it found you ? It 's best if I know . It was my fat.t. I used the phone . I called a friend. roger . I guess ... I needed to feel normal , you know . Like a person . So you broke the rules . Yeah . The rule NO.1 is , there is no normal . Down , down , down . I think I messed up my ankle . What the hell was that ? The thing from the future I mentioned . We need to get him to a hospital . We need to call the police . No , you call the police , Police come , that thing kills them . I need tape . Then we have to get out of here . Your car 's outside . We can just take your car , and we can- - The road 's blocked. it 's out there . We won 't be going that way . Is there another road out of here ? No . Schaeffer 's got a road . But it 's a mile through the woods , And I don 't think he 's there . Can you stand ? Barely . Leave me . Head for schaeffer 's place . See if you can get down that way . david , we 're a mess . We can 't run a mile through the woods . No one gets left behind . What about your daughter ? She 's not my daughter . She 's one of them from the future . No freaking way . She 's on our side . I need to know which one of you that thing is after . What do you mean , which one ? That thing wants one of you dead . I need to know why . Either of you deal with computers , Technology , the military , anything like that ? I 'm a banker . She 's a housewife . She 's nothing . hey ! you know what I mean . it 's a mistake . We 're normal people . Here. do you want your oxy , honey ? I have a bulging disk . L-4 . Look , We don 't know what we did . All right , we can 't help you . I 'm sorry . What 's this door handle made of ? It 's oil-rubbed copper . Why ? I wanted to see if I could help . You can look for flashlights . What are you going to do ? I 'm gonna set a trap . You have any hole saw bits ? A metal cylinder with teeth ? Uh , like for making holes for birdhouses ? I don 't know . I don 't make birdhouses . Me and my dad have made a million . We 're still waiting for our first bird family to move in . That sounds so lame , right ? Why would that sound lame ? Because you 're running around with guns , Fighting robots . Cybernetic organisms . The outside is very real . You 're fighting cyborgs , And we 're building birdhouses . I 'd trade for birdhouses any time . What 's it like ? I mean ... Doing what you do . It must be- - Why 'd you come out here ? You stand there like you 're gonna tell me a secret , But you don 't . My son does that . You really do this ? With a kid ? He 's why I do this . Is that it ? It 's my dad . There 's sothingg he 's not telling you . Sym dyne.tell me about it Sym dyne cybernetics , a company You 've been working with . Cybernetics ? What are you talking about ? David ? Computers , cyborgs , the future . Your husband 's been holding out . Okay , yeah . A tech company 's one of my clients . These are the emails . This is what I asked you for . Why didn 't you tell me ? It 's just business . It doesn 't have anything to do with robots . It 's cyborgs . What were you doing ? Business . Banking . Why do you need to know ? Because I 'm not here just to be nice And help your nice family . I 'm trying to stop the end of the world from happening And save my family . So I need to know what skynet 's doing And why they 'd want you dead . Why don 't you just tell her , david ? Because it 's not exactly legal . Okay ? why didn 't you tell me , david ? What part of secret and illegal do you not understand ? So this was an actual crime ? Oh , come on , and what are you doing on my computer ? Looking at lesbian porn . What 's the difference ? You 're gay ? lauren ? God , people . No ! Thanks for knowing me . Well , I 'm sorry , but apparently , Your father is suddenly some sort of criminal mastermind . anne , you have no idea- - is any of this real ? Quiet ! This is very real . What is it ? Is something happening ? They 're hunting . Hunting what ? Each other . So are we safe ? No one is ever safe . I 'm sorry . - I need some air . - you know how to use this ? If you do , take it . If you don 't , leave it . You don 't go outside without it . Hello ? Hello ! Excuse me . Your fly 's open . Sorry . This keeps reopening . You need to lie still . Where is she ? Where is lauren ? She went out for some air . You let her ? With that thing out there ? Your kid 'll be fine . Lauren , she hasn 't been a kid for months . It 's easy to think , It 's easy to say . It 's not always so . What do you know about it ? I know she 's protecting you . I know that story she told me About calling that roger guy was crap . She 's too smart to call anybody . But somebody called roger . And I 'm guessing it was you . Kids can adapt to all this . It 's harder for adults . Is it necessary to destroy the entire house completely . David , you got us into this . Let her do her job . What can I do ? In the bag. give me a black tape . You never asked where the money came from . I assumed you were earning it . Oh , now what ? I 'm going to the bathroom . Is that okay ? What 'll that do ? There 's a chip in their head . Shock 'll trigger reboot . If one of them touches this door handle , We have two minutes to get the chip out . Does that work ? I 've only tried it on the girl . And , no , it doesn 't always work . So what guarantees he comes through the front door ? They always come through the front door . I didn 't know the lights worked . I switched the breakers back . Who are you calling ? No one. sorry . I 'm- - I 'm just checking the phone line . I 'm scared . Hawaii . Yes . Are you married ? To your son 's- - No. barely knew him . Lucky you . You think you 're getting this . Then you realize you got that . Don 't worry about the past . It 's easy for you to say . I 'm not like you . I 'm just normal . I was normal . All this I had to learn . I thought crisis was supposed to bring a family closer . Don 't confuse close with happy . hey , I see something . I saw something . I think someone 's coming . Get back from the window . It 's not her. it 's a man . I think it 's mr. schaeffer . Who ? It 's roger from the next property over . It 's okay. we know him . these things can look like anyone . Friends , neighbors . I told roger we were camping this weekend . charles ! - Dogs can smell these things . - no , it 's him . What would he be doing here ? - That 's him . - how could you know ? The shock will kill him . - I know it 's him . - wait . Hey , annie. roger , get inside ! He 's coming to see me , okay ? She never goes camping . She keeps the home fires going . With roger ? Don 't confuse close with happy . I know it was stupid . But I needed ... to let him know . And now he 's dead . And david is dead . I know he is . I had no idea what happy was . It 's funny the things you say to yourself . Oh , I 've seen worse . It 'll be fine . Can 't happen to me . But the worst is always out there , isn 't it ? And it can happen to you . And it isn 't fine . Even after everything , she 's still trying to ... Cover for me . Protect my dignity , I guess . She needs it to be normal . She needs to be good . Or seem that way . All right ... No more talking , okay ? It 's gonna get your heart rate up . It 's not good . It doesn 't matter . Lauren matters . And this baby matters . They 're all that 's gonna be left of me after this is over . A mother knows . You the one ? Who sent the signal ? No . My shore party picked up a coded s.o.s.about 45 ticks back . Sent me to fossick around . What 's that in english ? It means someone 's still alive inside . Probably a civilian . Probably hiding . Radio room , I 'm guessing . I didn 't go in that far . What 'd you say about a shore party ? Making troop and supply runs back and forth from perth for months . Seawolf sub . The jimmy carter . You 've got a nuclear sub ? Who drives it ? Not who. what . We got a scrubbed triple eight for a captain . You 've got metal running the sub . Well , you find me a sub commander Who survived j-day , I 'll switch him in . Have a little faith , mate . She 'll be apples . Means we 'll be all right . You believe that ? Sure as my mother loves me . My mother 's dead . Here . Gas ? Bugs . This gonna work ? Probably not . Come on. come on . We need to get her to a hospital . This isn 't like last time . It 's not gonna happen . She needs a doctor . A real doctor . She needs you to keep it together . Oh , yeah , who put you in charge ? You did. just now . Until sarah connor comes through that door , The safest place in the whole damn world is right here . They can 't kill it . They couldn 't kill it before . They can 't kill it now . Baby. my baby . I 'm sorry . When did this whole affair thing start ? You want to talk about this now ? Was it last summer when I couldn 't travel because of my back accident ? You have a bulging disk from sleeping on your stomach . I slipped and fell ! You have a weak core ! Well at least my core isn 't a slut . Hophead . Whore ! Okay , that is your wife. don 't you . Damn it . The fuses are fried . Not sure I can get the power rerouted . And who is this again ? Sarah . She saved our lives . From a guy who looks like a guy but is a robot ? It 's real , roger . A real man , maybe , but anne ... Robots ? Hey , the correct term Is cyborg . roger ? Did you drive here ? No , but I got the 540 at my place . A mile away and we 're out of here . in our condition , With that thing out there , we 'll never make it . Fine , david . I 'll carry you . You have no idea what you 're talking about . Oh , right , right. the cyborgs . Anne ? Look at me . She 's a crazy woman . And this guy out in the woods Is probably her meth-head boyfriend or something . This is what we 're going to do . You 're gonna come with me to my place . We 'll head into town- - get everyone fixed up . Then we 'll talk all this through like adults . What the hell is that ? It 's one of those things . Is it dead ? I hope not . This is a good one. is she ? I don 't think so . Can you turn her back on ? It 's coming . Roger ! Roger ! David , what are you doing ? I 'm the one it wants. somebody 's got to do something . Can 't let you do that . Lady ... I don 't give a damn about skynet Or whatever the hell it is you 're selling . I 'm trying to save my family . So let me go out there and do it , Or I 'll do it right here . Daddy ! I 'm sorry ... For everything . Hey , I 'm david fields , the one you want . Take me. leave my family . It 's not him . It 's after one of you . Someone 's not telling me something . I can 't help you both run . Anne . David doesn 't know . It 's not his . You 're pregnant ? Okay , go . Stay in here. don 't make a sound . I 'm gonna help your mom get to roger 's car . Wait , no , you can 't . It 's after you . She 'll be safe here . Mom , I get it . I 'll be okay . You sure ? I mean , I 'd rather be making birdhouses . Me too . Ok , Anne , Let 's go . I did this to you . I 'm sorry . What is this about ? You don 't know what this is about ? This is about your mother And your baby sister . And they need you right now . My baby sister ? How do you- - Oh , god. you 're from the future . Your sister 's name is sydney . And I knew her . Those gas masks , they won 't help . You 're already infected . Sun 's up . We can 't move out till nightfall . That 's when the tin can switch to infrared . Guess we 'll just have to sit it out and wait . When we get to serrano point , they can cure this thing ? Let 's just get to serrano first . What is this ? it 's plumpy 'nut . It 's peanut butter mixed with baby formula And vitamin powder . Slept on top of a pallet of it on the trip over from perth . You guys are growing food again ? Yep. beats chasing rabbits . Rabbits ? Thought australia was all wombats And wallabies and stuff . No . Some wacko brought ' em over in the 1800s . We 've been overrunitith em ever since . Tried everything to kill the things . Trapped ' em , shot ' em , poisoned them , Built a fence across half the country To keep ' em out . In the 1950s , they even introduced a virus To wipe ' em out forever . It killed most of ' em , but a couple were immune , So ten years later , Oz was up to its eyeballs in rabbits again . Tough little bastards . At 's why you have to cook ' em longer . Can you pass me your water ? I 'm parched . Let 's go . In broad daylight ? Just ' cause you 're death-crazy Doesn 't mean we 've enlisted . it starts with a dry mouth . And then the sweats .

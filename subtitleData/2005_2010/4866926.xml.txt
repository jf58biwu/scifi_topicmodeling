 Previously on Heroes ... I must wipe your memory . 9th wonders ! Can we leave Matt out of this ? If you 're unhappy , we can always arrange for you to return to your former life . Just tell me what I 'm supposed to do . Stay with Parkman . I came here looking for you and what did I find ? You 're waiting for me . I mean , that 's got to mean something , right ? You saved my life once , Elle . Don 't you see I owe you ? I forgive you . Now you need to forgive yourself . The others probably figured out by now that there 's a third piece of the formula . It 's a catalyst hidden away in the blood of a human host . I think I 'm the catalyst . I see we share a fascination . It seems most of the powers that are documented took place during the last total annular eclipse . It 's coming . There 's a moment in every war where everything changes , a moment when the road bends . Alliances in battle lines shift , and the rules of engagement are rewritten . Moments like these can change the nature of the battle and turn the tide for either side . So we do what we can to understand them . To be ready for change , we steady our hearts , curb our fears , muster our forces , and look for signs in the stars . But these moments , these game changes , remain a mystery . Destiny 's invisible hand moving pieces on a chessboard . No matter how much we prepare for them , how much we resist the change , anticipate the moment , fight the inevitable outcome . In the end , we 're never truly ready , when it strikes . You 're getting pretty good at that . Well , it 's not as easy as you make it look . You 'll get there . Don 't sweat it . Yeah , well , I need to get there now . I have to prove myself . To who ? Nobody . I 'm not sure that you 'd understand . Okay . Then let 's go again . Gabriel . I need you to do something . Find Claire Bennet , bring her back to me . You think you can do that ? Yes , sir . Of course I can . I 'm going too . What ? Well , they 're not gonna make it easy for you , getting Claire . You need help . And I was raised to be a company girl . But I thought you 'd left all that behind you . Yeah . Well , it 's all I know . You need help . Let me help you . You okay with this , Dad ? I think the two of you together , it 's a good pairing . Let 's go get the cheerleader . Why is it always me ? You 're the catalyst . Arthur 's formula doesn 't work without you . I have a plan , but we all have to work together to stop him . Okay , so where 's everyone else ? Nathan 's going to find the Haitian . Matt Parkman will get Hiro Nakamura . And you , Claire , have the most important part to play . Great . What 's my assignment ? Your assignment is to keep from getting caught . Just stay out of harm 's way . But I can fight . I can do more . I can be more . The only place you 're going to be is underground , off the grid . No ! No way ! I am done hiding . We all have to make sacrifices . What are you gonna do ? Lock me up ? Don 't think it hasn 't crossed my mind . But , no , I have another plan . Hi , Claire-bear . It 's too dangerous for you to go there alone . I 'm just going down there to get the Haitian , then I 'm coming right back . The Haitian 's there to hunt down level five escapees . This guy , Baron Samedi , look . Baron ? Nono , it 's a Alia . Voodoo God of Death . This guy 's into some bad stuff . Drug trafficking , kidnapping , slavery . I 'm telling you , Nathan , you 're gonna need some help . Hey , I 'm not going down there to save the country . Look , hey , just - You don 't understand . Then help me out . When I found my abilities , I knew who I was supposed to be . Okay ? But now - Pete , just because you don 't have your abilities - It doesn 't mean you don 't have a purpose . It will if you don 't take me with you . Nathan . All right . Come on . I need the catalyst . You said you would have it by now . You said you were going to cure me ! I 've got people on it , but all our plans might be for nothing . What are you talking about ? I drew that . It 's going to happen today . This is Claire Bennet . She can 't die . It 's impossible . That 's my point . It can 't happen , but it 's going to . You 're the scientist . You tell me how . There 's an eclipse today . Yes . When I first noticed abilities manifesting , there was an eclipse . A global event . You said it was a coincidence . Well , I thought it was , but - But what ? What does it mean ? Look , I don 't know ! But I do know if Claire Bennet dies , then the catalyst dies with her and there 's no hope for me being cured . That explains this . I 'm going to die . Everything 's going to change today . Everything . I don 't understand what Hiro Nakamura has to do with any of this . Angela made our orders very clear . Yeah , the guy 's a spaz . No , he 's a time traveler . If Arthur Petrelli has us on the ropes , the man is a walking do-over . I know I had Hiro 's number in his dad 's homicide file . Are you nervous about something ? Arthur Petrelli scares me . Oh , you don 't have to be scared about him . Of course I do ! He can take away abilities , and I betrayed him ! I betrayed you . No . No , you didn 't . I 'm a betrayer . What ? And a liar and a thief and - I am selfish . You know , honestly , I don 't understand why you keep me around ! Because you 're one of the good guys now . So , you trust me ? - Yes ! Completely ? Yes , I trust you completely . I know you , Daphne . No , you say that , but you don 't know me , not really . We had a life together . In a dream . It was a spirit walk . It wasn 't real ! Arthur killed your father . He could kill us all or worse ! I 'm not gonna let anything happen to you . I promise . Please , just help me find Hiro . Come on . How are you gonna do that exactly ? That guy 's a freakin ' teleporter . Hey , I need your help . You have to fix Hiro . Look . What does it say ? It says , " You have to fix Hiro . " Arthur Petrelli erased his memory . He now thinks he 's 10 years old . Oh , it 's back there . We 're all gonna die . This is Stephen Canfield 's house . You 'll be safe here . Out of harm 's way . The last time we were here , we almost got sucked into a black hole . What makes it so safe now ? Simple set-up . Controllable . Yeah , I know how you like to control things . Okay , I 'll bite . What does that mean ? It means you 'll do whatever it takes To keep the catalyst safe , right ? I want to keep you safe , Claire . You . Not some catalyst . Do you understand ? Yeah , I understand . Aren 't you dead ? Yeah , you would like that . What 's your game , nemesis ? I 'm not a nemesis anymore . I 'm a good guy now . I can 't help him . I can 't understand him . Well , Arthur really did a number on Hiro . He really thinks he 's 10 . So get inside his head and fix him . I don 't think I can . He 's thinking in Japanese . But the comic book says that you - I don 't know what to tell you . This is way beyond me . Hiro is our reset button . Our walking do-over , remember ? I know , but he still can time-travel , he can teleport , and he 's still very powerful . I can 't - I can 't do this . I 'm sorry . I got to get out of here . What ? What are you talking about ? Daphne ! You paused . - What ? When I asked you if you trust me , you paused . No . No , I didn 't . I 'm a speedster . Fractions of seconds feel like hours to me And you paused . You don 't know me And you don 't know what I 've been through ! What is that supposed to mean ? Daphne , come on . Matt - Lawrence , Kansas . Stop reading my mind ! What 's in Kansas ? Come on . Just back off ! - Your home . Leave me alone ! Yes , sir . It 'll all be taken care of . Who was on the phone ? Arthur . Just updating him on our status . He thinks Claire 's with her father . Ugh . Glasses himself . Scary . He 's not gonna make this any easier . Actually , he is . I didn 't want him to get inside my head so he could kill me , but it worked both ways . I know how he thinks . I know where he 'll hide her . I 'm worried about you . All these " yes , sirs " And checking in like a good little boy . I 'm just trying to be responsible . Oh , sure . Responsible . Where is this damn rental car guy ? Probably calling the police because I told him you were a serial killer and that you kidnapped me . You must be joking . Why the hell would you do that ? Because I 'm trying to help you . Because it was wrong of the company to hide our abilities . Because we can do whatever we want . We can take whatever we want . Trust me . Come on , we 're going . You 're not going anywhere ! Oh , God ! Oh , help ! Please , help . Please . Let go of the girl . Thank you . Oh , God , thank you . Oh , my God . Thank you . Sir , please , put down the gun . You really don 't understand what 's happening here . She filled me in pretty good , you serially-killing scum of the earth . They 're all trying to make you into something . A boy scout . A monster . Who 's it gonna be , huh ? Who are you really ? Shut up . I should kill you right now . Say it was self-defense . I 'll be famous . A Bona fide hero . I hate heroes . What does this eclipse mean ? And how could it possibly affect us ? The moon controls the ocean 's waves , the sun our internal timing , but something is happening to me . I 'm changing . I can feel it . And I can 't control it . What 's this for ? Hit me with it . You wanted me to train you , let 's do it . Right here , right now . Is this how you get over your guilt ? Because I 've been just fine without you . Have you ? I caught the puppet guy . Yeah , you got lucky , and you almost got your mother killed . These are serious , dangerous criminals . I know ! You 're not acting like it . What am I acting like ? Like a girl who can 't get hurt ! Stupid and careless ! What do you know ? You 're the one who left , remember ? My absence does not give you license to act like a brat . I have been trying to do something good with my abilities . And I 'm trying to keep you safe . I don 't need your help ! Then hit me ! I said hit me ! Uhh ! The good news is you 've certainly got the strength . The bad news is you 're clumsy , slow , and obvious . Thanks . This time , get your body weight into it . That way all the power will be on the other end of the board . Okay , let 's go again . What is this , Tae-kwon-do ? No , it 's baseball . Let 's go again . It 's Tracy . Nathan 's veering off plan . He 's gone to find this Haitian guy . That 's smart , using the Haitian against me . We can 't have that . You 're not gonna hurt him ? I 'm learning today there are some things out of my control . What is that supposed to mean ? It 's time for Nathan to see the world for what it really is . Look , I agreed to help you because you said that we could get Nathan into the White House . You need him , Arthur . So do you . I need you to go to Parris Island . Use those connections you 've got . I don 't take orders from you . If you watch your way into the Oval Office , you 'll do exactly as I say . Parris Island ? The Marine training facility ? Every war needs an army . Washington . I guess there 's no rest for the wicked . Obviously not . I need Hiro to help me find Daphne . But she stole the formula . She 's a villain . No , she 's not . She 's just scared . Of what ? I don 't know , I don 't know . But I 've got to find out . I told her that I doubted her . I practically packed her bags for her . Look , we need to help Hiro , get him back to normal , stop Arthur Petrelli - But it 'll only take a minute . All he has to do is teleport me to Lawrence , Kansas , I grab Daphne - Lawrence , Kansas . Yes , that 's us . We 're in a corn field . She told me that she grew up on a corn farm . Corn farm ? - Yeah . Hiro , Lawrence , Kansas . Holy crap , it worked . This is it . This is Daphne 's house . I can hear her thoughts . She 's in there . Uhh ! Holy crap ! Huh ? Pete ! Pete , you all right ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm okay . Are you ? I 'm good . What happened ? I don 't know . I was flying and then I wasn 't . I was falling really fast . And now ? Nothing . I can 't fly . Hey , wasn 't there an eclipse that first day you flew ? Yeah . So ? So , you don 't find that significant ? The guy we 're looking for , the Haitian , he takes powers away . Maybe he saw us coming . I don 't know . Maybe it 's this whole damn country . We got to find him . Come on , let 's make tracks . We 've got a long walk ahead of us . What the hell are these ? Voodoo dolls ? Huh ? No , they 're called pwen . They 're messengers . Prayers for salvation . Redemption . Let 's go . Looking at the map , Haitian 's village is this way . I saw it from two clicks up . We were falling . Yeah . It 's still this way . Hey , are you gonna - Don 't you want - Something I can do for you ? Hi . Yeah , um - I 'm a friend of Daphne 's . Can I talk to her for a second ? Daphne 's not here . Daphne , I know you 're inside ! Come on , I just need a minute . Go away , Matt . Like I said , she 's not home . Um ... Why don 't you just let me inside ? Are you threatening me ? Uh , I said ... Let me in . Why are you turning your head sideways ? What 's your problem , son ? Psst ! What happened ? My - my powers are gone . His also . What 's going on ? Are you gonna tell me who that was ? Nope . I 'm not asking a lot of questions here . And I appreciate that . But you 've been gone a long time . It 's my home . Can 't I just come home ? Are you feeling okay ? No . It 's happening again . Ah , sweetheart , I 'm sorry . Do you still have them ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'll go get ' em . All right , all right . If we double back , We should be able to make it to the village in an hour . You 're not even gonna admit you were wrong . You really want to get into this now ? Come on . You 've got to stop treating me like your idiot kid brother . You read the map right . Congratulations . I wish I could fly . But you can 't . That 's right , I 'm powerless just like you . Hey , if it wasn 't for me , you 'd be lost and alone ! If it wasn 't for you , I 'd be home by now . I only brought you down here to protect your fragile ego . You know what ? I don 't need your pity . No , but you know what you do need ? My help . I 've been saving your ass my entire life . Is that so ? - That 's right . When you jumped off that roof like a moron , who caught you ? Who pulled you out of Kirby Plaza when you were about to blow up ? You want my respect ? You want my approval ? Earn it ! Why would I want your respect ? You 're a puppet ! Excuse me ? You have no spine . I 'm a U.S. Senator . You 're a nurse . You 're everything that Dad ever wanted you to be . His dreams , huh ? His goals . He could always find a way to get under your skin And manipulate you and use you . Where 's this coming from ? In the future , you choose him . You choose Dad , Nathan . Well , I 'm down here right now , Pete . I 'm trying to stop him . Now help me . Good ! Control first , follow through second . You feel that power ? Again . Tell me what you 're thinking . No . All right , Tap into that anger . It 'll give you strength . Here , take a swing at me now . I don 't want to swing at you . Come on . Swing at me ! See if you can hit me . Let 's go . Come on . Uhh ! You 're not even trying , Claire . Tell me what you 're thinking . Every time you would come home from a trip , I 'd always hug you as hard as I could . Uhh ! Because I thought if I held you tight enough , you wouldn 't leave me again . Uhh ! Why did you always leave ? ! I need to get some air . Claire , wait a minute . Let 's talk about this . No , I didn 't mean to bring it up . Just forget it . Hey , girls . You have the Haitian in here ? No , just me . Back out of the house , now . You 're not getting Claire . Funny story . We are . Claire , stay back ! No ! Claire ! Sandra ! Aah ! Uhh ! Oh , my God . What happened ? She got shot . Why isn 't she healing ? - I don 't know . Something 's wrong . Her abilities aren 't working . We have to get her to a hospital . No ! They report gunshot wounds to the police . They 'll ask questions . She is bleeding ! She is hurt ! I 'm calling 911 . And what happens when her healing comes back ? Noah - This is a surface wound . We can deal with it . Hang up the phone , please ! I 'll get the first aid kit . Thank you . Uhh ! What happened ? I don 't know . I wish I did . Maybe you were right . I 've been stupid , careless . I thought I was invulnerable . Uhh ! Claire , you shouldn 't have - It hurts . I never thought I 'd be able to hurt again . Uhh , it sucks , but it 's wonderful . Thank you for saving my life . Anytime . Still no powers . Yeah , that much I get . Why is this happening ? How do we get it back ? Maybe Daphne was right . Maybe Arthur took them away . You know , I never , ever thought that I would miss my - Right now , all I want to do is just know what 's going on inside her head . What are we supposed to do ? He says you must save Daphne . I can 't ! I ... can 't ! Not without my brain thingy . What ? He says this is part of the hero 's quest . Can you triumph without powers ? Hey ! Hey , seriously , dude , stop it . Hey ! How do you say " stop it " ? You must not doubt ! I 'm not gonna hurt you . I 'm gonna save Daphne . Holy crap ! It 's a miracle . Complete remission . All effects of the formula have disappeared . Scales , abilities , I have no idea how or why . Some correlation to the eclipse ? Further study is warranted . But not yet . You 're not going anywhere . Now we know the meaning of the eclipse . Everyone 's abilities have gone away . You have to get them back . I 'm not sure that 's entirely possible . I mean , who knows what the implications of this event are ? They could be irreversible . That 's unacceptable . What are you doing ? ! Without abilities , I 'm nobody . I already been nobody . You understand ? So , we gonna stay right here until you get it all back for us . Excuse me ? Be with you in a second . Don 't worry . We got plenty of red hulks for everybody . Sam ? - Yeah ? Dude , this is so awesome . Is he always this quiet ? I don 't know . Why don 't you ask him ? I really appreciate your help , But we need to get you back home . My father 's alive . Arthur 's alive ? Yeah . You 're one of the only people who can stop him . Now the sooner you take this juju off of me , The sooner I can fly us home and deal with him . I 'm not responsible for your condition . My ability is gone as well . The universe has decided our fate . Can the universe get me a phone ? I can call the military , get us on a C-130 , get this sorted . I 'm not going anywhere until I stop Samedi . The guy from level five . I am responsible for his evil . He is my brother . Like us , special . His skin is impenetrable . By knife , and by fire , and by bullet . Many people here believe him to be a god . He uses fear to form an army . They murdered , stole , kidnapped . I stopped him once , put him away , but now ... Hey , you can 't do this on your own . Peter , this is not your fight . You helped our family out once . At least let us repay that favor . Hey , look , all right , you proved you can be brave , okay . Don 't be stupid . Think about it , Nathan . The only way to get this guy to come back home with us is if we help him stop his brother . Look , if you 're not gonna do this for the right reasons , at least do it for the selfish ones . Go ! Go ! Run ! Je m 'appelle , Nathan Petrelli . Je suis American . We know all about you , Senator Nathan Petrelli . Your father warned us you 'd come . My father ? Yes . What did he tell you ? He told me to be myself . Hey , no fever . You feeling okay ? Yeah . Pretty good , all things considered . We 're gonna figure out what 's happening to you . But for now , you just rest . I 'll be right downstairs . I love you , Dad . I love you , Claire-bear . No . No what ? You 're leaving , aren 't you ? Do not leave your daughter . Not now . She 's fine . She 's scared . She doesn 't know what 's happening . She needs you . There 's something I need to finish . Daphne ? Daphne , I 'm not leaving until I talk to you . Go away , Matt . No . No , I came here because I know exactly who you are . You are smart and beautiful and funny . I don 't even care if the - the spirit walk is all a bunk . I 'm not gonna - I 'm never gonna give up because - Because I 'm in love with you . Daphne ! The door 's open . Daph ? I 'm in here . I just didn 't want you to see me like this . Like what ? Like this . Hi , sweetie . Claire . Aah ! Oh , God ! Oh , it hurts ! Well , it 's gonna hurt forever if I can 't set it . Stop being such a baby ! Oh ! Oh , thanks . Yeah . What 's happening to us ? I have no idea . I used to understand everything , but ... nothing makes sense . We 're just human . You okay with that ? It 's actually a relief . I felt the hunger , the need to have powers , so numbing . My mind felt like it was full of cotton and ice . I haven 't felt like this since - Since I first met you . I pushed you to become that monster . It 's my fault . - No . You were just following orders , a company girl . Exactly ! We 're both so - Powerless ? We can 't take what we want anymore . Says who ?

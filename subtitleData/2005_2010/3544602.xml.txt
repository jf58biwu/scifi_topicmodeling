You know what the options are . - [ speaking native language ] - and thi. and thi . - what artifact did that ? - or is that the artifact ? - it was reated by a little-known culptor Walter burleigh , And it was tolen late last night From a high-end auction house in new york . But that 's not the issue . The isue is how this thing was stolen , because- i 'm trying to figure out why After i just got back into this world You 're in such a rush to hove me out the door . - because i didn 't spend half my life trying to save your life So you ould surf the net and wath youtube . - well , excuse me for trying to atch up on urrent events And the state of the world in the last 1 years . - hey , we 're working .

I mean , this theft was ... imposible . There was a high-end alarm system , Eight-inch thick walls , Sealed vault . So one seond that culpture was there , Next eond gone . - but it 's till just a well-executed art theft . I mean , it doesn 't automatically shout " warehouse , " Doe it ? - things rarely shout " warehouse . " They usually whisper , " hey , that 's a little odd . " That 's what they do . Well , i could be wrong . i mean , it ould be nothing . But i 'm probably not wrong . Last time i was wrong was 187 , june . - stop right there. that .

Is it conneted to the culpture omehow ? - there are hundreds Of these native amerian creation myths . - i know , i know . I still think that the feather , however , Gives us our best clue . Anyway , the feather was predominantly used By the delaware nations , And also by the ... Aha. by the lenape tribe . They 're the one who old manhattan to the dutch For 2 bucks worth of arts and craft . - that 's not a great deal . - you had to be there . - and according to lenape legend , The world was created through the spirits of four element . Four . fire , whih gave us our soul . Wind , our breath . Water , death . It 's fascinating . And rock , whih have the w- - Leena . Rock gave the world ... solidity . - so omeone has a buckskin coat that manipulate olidity . - no . - i think that this whole thing Could be a pattern . Because if there are artifact that ontrol the other elements , And somebody were to acquirethose artifacts , That omebody would have Immense power over ... - the world . - at the risk of ounding dramati . - that 's never stopped you before . - that 's true . [ farnworth beeps ] - mama ? Ow. ooh , ooh. a--ooh ! [ groans ] - pete , what took you so long ? Uh , listen . Jeffery weaver ... I think that that guy needs a second look . - myka 's taking a look at him now Over dried turkey , mushy vegetables , And tapioa pudding . - okay . you 're till in the hospital ? - i got pushed out of the ide of a teel truck . I 'm recuperating . - yeah , well , recuperate later . While myka 's keeping weaver busy , Uh , i 'm gonna need you to tos his apartment . - why steal his stuff from himself ? I weaver our guy ? - well , tell me what you find out , And i will let you know . - it 's very romanti . - i had , uh , verna turn up the steam tables . It 's all about atmosphere . - well , you sure know how to wow a girl . - it 's my best move . So what made you join the secret ervice ? - [ exhales ] well , um ... It was either that or prison . I 'm kidding . - what about you . I mean , what is it you do exactly ? - accrue interest . Re-invest . Try to do something good with it . - that 's a nie life . - yeah , well , it depends on how you got it . - your father . - my father , yeah . - and you don 't- - You don 't want to follow in hi footteps . I that it ? - i want to erase hi footteps . What ? What ? - i 'm just trying to deide If i 'm itting here with a good guy or a bad guy . - you know who was in business with radburn year ago ? - the other guy who wanted the culpture ? - that 's right . jeffery weaver 's father . And both those guys tried to push really hard at that time To ell them , all four of the sculptures . - [ sighs ] yeah . What do they do ? - i don 't know . I gues , you know , Something happens when you put all four culptures together . My best guess , omething ... - bad . - bad . something bad . - you find anything at weaver 's yet ? - no , i don 't know . Thi place is clean . If he 's the guy with the oat , he probably ... Oh , come on . - what ? - it 's probably nothing . i 'll all you back . - no , no , no . wait , wait. what ? - you got to be kidding me . what a hack . Bingo mania . - so what are you really after in all this ? And don 't tell me the government needs to know . - i 'm here for the oat . And , yeah , the government actually does want it . There are certain things That just shouldn 't be out in the world . - true . - but , you , you 're only interested in the sculpture . Why ? They 're not that valuable . - i think things that were created together Belong together . - whoever 's doing this , And i haven 't ruled you out yet , I alo colleting them . What happens when the four sculptures are together ? Seriously , jeff , you should tell me , Before omebody- - [ cell phone rings ] Just give me a seond . - pete ? i everything okay up there ? - yeah , i 'm at weaver 's . - what ? wh--what are you- the guy 's got a secret room that 's a hrine to burleigh . He must have bought up everything the guy ever touched . Whatever 's going on , Your boyfriend 's neck deep in it . - i 'll wrap thi up then . [ clears throat ] - so we should probably head upstairs , huh ? - you know , i 'd really rather go back to your place . - you know , it 's funny . I usually like it when a beautiful woman says that . - that is funny . that is funny . Because i never like it when my date lies to me . - you know , i don 't- - Burleigh was married to a lenape woman . And the sculptures Are some kind of a key To a acred , underground cave . - to a sacred what ? - a cave . Uh , it ays it ontains four offerings To the pirit of creation . Somehow he hid the diretions to the ave In the culptures . - so those four sculpture , See , they 're a map . If you put the four sculptures together , They tell you where thi ave i . - yeah , but how , artie ? I mean , we 're missing something . - mr. radburn , we found thi man trying to break in . - it 's lacell , right ? What do you do for me , mr. lacell ? - geologial urveys , sir . - that 's right. you see what 's underground , don 't you ? And yet here you are , lurking very high above ground . Find anything interesting ? - no , sir . - you 're not a very good liar , mr. lacell . And you work for mr. weaver . Don 't waste your breath with denial . Was he wearing it ? - yes , ir . - let me have it . Tell me about thi . - it 's nothing . My father gave it to me . - don 't you mean your uncle ? As i aid before , deception i not your strong suit . Walter burleigh was your uncle , wasn 't he ? Why do you think that i hired you ? I had hoped you would lead me to the place . Your uncle hid lue to the sacred cave in his art . What 's this ? Water , rok , wind . Well , that 's helpful . Now i know how to arrange the culptures . Wait for me outide . But what then ? How does it work ? How will they lead me to the place Where the objects are hidden ? - i don 't know . Give that back . You have what you want . - do you want to leave here alive , Lacell ? Oh , i there more ? " the truth is in the dawn . " What does it mean ? - i don 't know . [ groaning ] " the truth is in the dawn . " What does it mean ? - i don 't know ! - i don 't know . - i suppoe you didn 't know . - " the truth is in the dawn . The truth i in the dawn . " I--i don 't know what that means , But it 's--it 's written all over burleigh 's notes . - what 's--what 's written ? - uh ... dawn . Thi--i mean , i don 't know . Uh , creation , maybe . tony orlando and . - creation ... or destruction . - yeah . [ igh ] Look , artie , how much of this stuff do we really believe ? - well , enough that if he 's looking for thi ave , It 's better that we find it firt . - i would agree with that . Your partner 's already got me overed . - lucy , you 've got some ' splaining to do . - so where 's the ode ? - gilbert radburn beat me to it , Same way he 's been trying to find the ave . - what ave ? - underground , sacred . chek it out . - we have to top him . Like you said , there are some things That hould not be out in the world . - yeah , well , what about that big guy That works for the two of you ? - lacell is lenape . He want to save the ave too . He 's been my eyes at radburn 's digs . He hasn 't cheked in either . i think something 's happened . - okay , so we have to find this cave Before radburn does . - well , if he 's got all four culptures , He ould be there now . - we 've got all of burleigh 's note right here . - well , that hasn 't helped me solve it yet . - true , mr. weaver . But ... you 're not me . And right now we need to find the location of that ave Before radburn does . - the truth i in the dawn . Of oure . it 's a map . Thank you . - so burleigh stopped taking note When he got cloe to finding the ave . - yeah . - it 's like he realize the stories were true And stopped writing anything down . - well , you know , i think it may be enough Because i found all these old maps , and i- knok knok . - i wish you wouldn 't do that . - [ guffaws ] - god ! not funny . H-h-hang on . - i just ame by to grab my tool And then i 'm hitting the proverbial road . I 'm thinking vegas . " really ? vegas , claudia ? Remember , always hit on 16 , never on 1 .

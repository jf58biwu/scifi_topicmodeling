I would get exhausted . / But he was impatient and wanted / to give me all the information / he thought most relevant / to my primary human development . I 've done it . I 've done it . I would have done it . There there , my little Puzzlehead . You 've made me very proud . Everything 's going to be alright now . That 's a good boy . You can rest now . / I became an interactive humanoid life form , / with sensory faculties that enabled me / to be a conscious being with emotions . / Enormous cognitive capacity , / and no sense of mortality . / A robot , created in the image / - or self-image - of Walter .

Curious . That was a very strange move . But you can 't move like that . Quite amazing ... but you play so mechanicly . It sounds too sterile . How should I play for you ? Here , listen . With some feeling . / I read in his journal that he had / mixed tri-meciline in such a way / that allowed him to stay away / for up to two weeks / with no immediately perceptible side effects . / He sat unrealistic deadlines for himself / regarding my progress / and justified his usage to need them . / Of course , this drug had never been / tested except on himself . / He was confused , / lethargic , and apathetic at times . / The tri-meciline gave him clarity / and provided to productiveness , to the insomnia . No , no . Stop . Stop ! Too much Bach . I wanna hear something new . Something different . - Something lively , vivacious . - I know a Scarlatti sonata . Let me hear it . / During my early development / I was very precocious / and extremely curious which made me eager / to build my own experiences . / I only had Walter 's memories , / and they were meaningless to me . / Like senseless silent films / stored in my brain by accident . - Puzzlehead . - Yes , Sir ? I 've been thinking . You have been making a great deal of progress lately . I 'm very proud of you . I can 't begin to tell you how pleased I am with your education . You are intelligent . It 's astonishing how quickly you 've been learning . The rate while ... Well , it 's a wonder what you may achieve one day . Now , it 's my feeling that you must learn things that I cannot teach you here at home . So , I have decided , that ... it 's time for you to be little outside and see the world for yourself . What do you mean ? I understand that you 're a bit frightened of the unknown . I too . I 'm afraid at times . However ... I have decided , and that 's final . Your move . How did it feel ? Pretty good . / Sleep was interesting to me . / It seemes like such a peaceful activity . / I don 't have to sleep , / but I had read that people / experience dreams when they sleep . / Dreams are like thoughts / without the boundaries of reality . / In them you act out unconscious / and buried desires . / I wish I could have them . Hey . Could you ... Could you come here on a second ? I ... I just wanna ask you a couple of questions . - What 's your name ? - Puzzlehead . Puzzlehead ? What kind of an idiotic name is Puzzlehead ? I 'm going to shut you off . - Wait . - Yes ? What was he trying to do ? He was trying to kill you . I guess he wanted to take your money . What is it like to be killed ? You die . What does it mean to be dead ? You don 't have to worry about being dead . Why not ? You cannot die . You are a robot . I guess when you 're shut off it 's like being dead . Do you experience anything when you 're shut off ? No . Why don 't you get some rest ? Turn to the left . / After repairing my arm , Walter installed / a video recording device . / He recorded everything I saw . Turn to the right . / If I had known the consequences of this , / I would have never opened my eyes .

Where are you going ? Out . Can I come with you ? No , you stay home . So , how do we doing ? Not exactly to rent , is it ? You know , you 're beautiful girl ... [ Wiesz , jesteœ piêkna dziewczyna ... ] It will be easier for you if you let me ... Let me ... [ Bêdzie ci l ¿ ej , jak pozwolisz mi ... Pozwól ... ] Come on , let me , darling . [ No pozwól , kochana ... ] Come here . [ ChodŸ tu . ] Come to me , you little cunt . [ ChodŸ tutaj do mnie , ty pizdo ma ³ a . ] Look at me . Look at me . [ Popatrz na mnie . ] Until next time . / Left alone without my usual activities / I started to have other feelings . / I felt solemn and melancholy . / I didn 't mind these feelings / but I prefered not to have them . / I wanted to know where they came from . / Why I had them . Oh . You 're back . Is this what you do when I am out ? Have I no privacy with you now ? Get up ! Out ! Get out ! Yes , Sir . I don 't want you here anymore . Do you understand ? Yes , Sir . Good . Close the door . Give me the money ! - Oh ... Alright . - Hurry up ! Don 't shoot ! Hey , you ? Who are you ? Leave her alone . What do you want , be a hero ? Please , come in . Would you like something to drink ? No . Thank you . Do you ? Where the hell have you been all night ? Answer me . Out . Out . Out where ? Just out . It 's not good enough . Don 't get rebellious with me . You answer me . Why ? I did nothing wrong . Can I have any privacy ? What ? Don 't . You dare to fight me ? I won 't stand for this behavior . I won 't ! / Come on , hurry up ! / Hey , you . / No one has ever done / anything like that for me before . / Why not ? / Why should anyone care about me ? / What about your father ? / My mother and father died / when I was a child , during they decline . / I never knew them . Good morning , Puzzlehead . Your rebellious behavior the other day was unacceptable . I trust you understand that . I have some chores for you to do today . I want you to mop and wax the floors . Use the floor power so I 'll make sure that you don 't leave film or streak marks . I 'll be out for a while . What are you doing ? I heard you come home . Done out your chores , I presume . - Yes , Sir . - Good . You can go to your room now . / Something was happening . / I was constantly disoriented . / I was finding myself in different places / than the last when I remembered . / The calendar would be changed , / sometimes up to three days later . / I suspected that I was being shut off remotely . / But I didn 't have any evidence . / I managed to look at his journal , / and my suspicioned were confirmed . / Walter was only keeping me turned on / long enough to finish house whole chores . / He installed a sensing device / and limited by waking hours severely / to keeping underclothes supervision . / I remembered this schematics . / Then came up with the solution . / I installed crude but effective battery pack / with enough reserve to allow me / do manual re-power myself / after being shut off . - What were you up to ? - Oh . I had to get somewhere dish-washing detergent . We 're all-out . There is none downstairs either . I 'll get some more tomorrow . Finished your laundry and the vacuuming and then you 'd be done for today . I 'm going to be out doing some errants for a while . / ' ll be back in a few hours . / At first , after installing the battery pack , / I would pretend to remain shut off . / Sometimes for hours , to be safe . / But I soon learned his habits . / My discovery of the remote / angered me greatly . / I was angry at Walter for giving me consciousness / and then taking it away . / For pretending he was my father , / when he was just my maker . Hi . Hi . I was wondering , would you like to come over to my house ? - Your house ? - Yes , I ... I 'm ... I could make us some dinner or ... That sounds nice . Let me get my coat . I 'll just be in a minute . I 'll wait right here for you . May I take your coat ? / Having her in the house triggered / so many memories , / hardly any of them remind . / When Walter scanned his brain / to create my neural-net map / he was unable to controll what he copied . / The synaptical structure had been shaped / by the experiences and memories of his life . - This is where I live ... / - And thus his identity ... - It 's nice . / - ... his psyche was inbedded in it . / And I had everything he had ever seen / of Julia , flashing to my mind , / - ... uncontrollably . - The kitchen is downstairs . I 'll hang up your coat and hut . Make yourself comfortable . I 'll be right back . Wait ... No ... Please ... / I sat there for hours / thinking about what to do . / I was overcome by feelings of betrayal . / I felt jealous of him . / And even stranger , I felt jealous of Julia . / But it was apparent to me / that Julia thought he was me . / I wanna to tell her / that it was me , that she loved . / That it was me , who saved her / ant truly cared for . / I had to go to her . / I had to tell her who I was . What did you do ? Can you hear me , Julia ? Please , don 't die . Oh , God . Julia ... I don 't know why you did this . I 'm sorry , I didn 't mean to hurt you . I 'm ashamed . Please , forgive me . Julia ... / This period is difficult to describe . / My motor functions were left intact , / but were now re-programmed / in the manner of machinery for a factory . / I lost my highly sophisticated hypothesis testing / and memory searching inference abilities . / I was , in short , lobotomized and render docile . Julia ... Are you sure you 're feeling alright ? Well ... I think it might be the morning sickness . Morning sickness ? I never expected this . I 'll take care of you . I 'll take care of everything . How do you feel about this ? I don 't know . - Who is it who brings the food here ? - What is it ? I saw someone . And he left the box of food . You did ? - What did he look like ? - I don 't know , I didn 't see . He 's already down the street away . I see . So , is he a friend ? Oh , no , no . He 's just a delivery man . He brings groceries over . It 's a guy I have run in the deli while you 're recuperating . He 's turned into quiet profitable business , I must say . I see . There is ... so much I don 't know about you . Such inquisitiveness all over suddenly . I just want to talk . That 's all . You know , this house is soo big and sometimes I feel so alone . I 'm here . I know , but you 're always doing something else . I wouldn 't ask , but I couldn 't help but noticed the basement door is locked . It 's always been locked . You don 't want to go under anyway . It 's just a bunch of all junk . Believe me , you dont wanna see what 's in there . Nothing but a bunch of all junk . Oh , can 't I see ? Whatever for ? Besides , it 's a lot of dangers . The stairs are rotten . I haven 't been down there in years . Now , why don 't you concern yourself with resting - ... and stay in healthy , ok ? - Ok , I 'm sorry . Never mind all the questions . You had a bad dream . Here , drink this , you 'll feel better . Do you remember me ? No . Tell me what you remember . I was a child ... I used to play everyday . Everything was nice . My father would teach me new games . He would teach me how to learn . And he would write in his book how I did it . He said I got smarter ... and smarter everyday . Locate that circuit board on the right side . Aha . On it you will find three copper wires below the white circle . Yes , I see them . - What should I do ? - Cut those wires from right to left . Ok . Puzzlehead , what are you doing on ? Is there something wrong ? Come in here . Don 't just stand there . Well ? Shouldn 't somebody be watching the store , Puzzlehead ? I 'm not Puzzlehead . I 'm Walter . Don 't be silly . How could you be Walter if I am Walter , Puzzlehead ? This is preposterous . Who do you think you 're fooling ? Whatever do you mean . / I consumed all of the literature in our library . / My intelligence started to grow again / at explemential rates . / However , there was a buried part of me / that knew I was at the mercy of Walter 's flaws . / They left me with anger and hatred and revenge / that I was unable to control . / The by-pass perform by Julia unlock something . / And I felt my own will being overtaken / by Walter 's diseased mind . What are you doing ? Nothing . What it is to become of us ? What do you mean ? It 's so complicated . If only you were a human . So what if I 'm not a human ? How much better than human ? Are you not happy ? Yes . Good . Then stop worrying . Tell me ... what are you working on ? It 's a surprise . - Are you alright ? - I 'm fine . You must eat . I can 't . Not now , I 'm sorry . Why not ? I 'm not hungry . - What 's the matter ? - I 'm worried . - About what ? - About him . We can 't keep him locked in there forever . Don 't worry , Julia . I 'll take care of everything . You going out ? To the store . We are almost out of food . - You stay here . - I 'll come with you . No . I think you should be resting . Please , stay home . Walter ? Walter ... Please , let me out . You 're starving me . I 'm dying . I need your help . I 'm begging you . Please , don 't leave me here . Why would you let him do this to me ? I 'm believed you are him . How could you ... intrap me into carrying for you , into coming here ? I wish I could explain it , but I I was lost . You were my purpose . I tried for years to approach you , but I thought this was the only way I could be with you . Why didn 't you tell me about this before ? I was afraid you would leave me . I only want to be with you , Julia . If you can forgive me , I will never hida anything from you again . - Do you ... Do you forgive me ? - Yes , I do . / Help ... help me . Help us . / How ? / Where is he ? / He 's out the deli but he 'll be home . / Walter , I think the baby is coming soon . / We must hurry , / you need to get the keys . / - I think so . I ... / - Let me get ... What were you doing down there ? Answer me . Nothing . Liar . I swear . What do you think I was doing ? That 's for you to tell me . I wasn 't doing anything , I promise . You don 't have anything to worry about , my dear . I 'm not going to hurt you , or the baby . You believe me , don 't you ? Yes . Your human frailty 's make it impossible for you to be trusted . You 're so imperfect . You can 't see , can you ? I do . Without you the child could never be . But you have betrayed me . / I resigned the parts of my mind / that would not my own . / All of my memories and sensations were built / on the foundation of Walter 's experiences . / It wasn 't long before I realized / that I ' m a started over . / In order to regain my sanity and identity / it was necessary descan / that unspoiled neuro-net and being again . / Tabula rasa . Walter . I got out . But how ? There 's no time to explain . I have to destroy him while he is off . Stay here and I 'll be back to take you to the hospital . I 'm so glad . You just stay here and wait for me . Ok . Julia ? What ... Wait . No ! Don 't do it ! No ! Aah ! Walter ! I 'll be there soon . - Can I help you ? - Yes , room 5 ? It 's right over there . - Walter . - Yes . Thank God it 's you . - I thought you were ... - We are safe now . Isn 't he beautiful ? As beautiful as his mother . He looks just like you . / By scanning the baby 's brain / I was able to begin again . / I 'd program myself with what I wanted , / what I wished for . / Who I am is a mystery now . / I have recordings of my past life / to remind me of who I once was . / And in viewing them , / my past actions sometimes haunt me . / Despite all this , I am at peace . / There is a serenity in my unfettered mind . / And in creating my life all over again , / from the beginning / there is a great sense of hope . / So this is what it is to be a human ... subtitled : Orion1 , thanks : Kuba Darek

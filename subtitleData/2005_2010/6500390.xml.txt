 A couple of hours , I think ? It 's not enough . - I naturally don 't need a lot of sleep . - I can 't have you in the CIC like this . You 're on the verge of seing ghosts on the dradis screen . I 'm fine , sir . - I swear . - It 's a gift , son . It 's not a punishment . Go over to the Zephyr , get drunk , sleep for a week , recover . Shuttle leaves twice a day . You better hurry . Felix You owe me a big favor . Morph is a tough gap . Thank you . - If I didn 't ... - Go . It 'll be better . I 'll be waiting . Heading back to the CIC . Hey , Brooks . - You 're going to the Z too ? - Yeah , no fun for me . Maintenance detail . Oh , great . Skinjobs . What ? Welcome aboard the Zephyr shuttle , ladies and gents , we 'll be arriving at our destination in 15 minutes . There 's no inflight service today , so please refrain from drinking unless you 're willing to share with your flight crew . Zephyr approach , Raptor 7-1-8 inbound , out of marker . Raptor 7-1-8 , Zephyr approach . Dradis contact 1600 , heading 4-2-7 , carom 2-2-5 . Order inner marquer to sequency . Copy all , 4-2-7 carom 2-2-5 put to the inner marker . ETA 15 minutes . Fleet , Galactica . Inbound cylon hostiles . All ships , emergency jump . I say again , emergency jump . - Prepare to jump . - Can 't we just get to Zephyr ? Calculation 's complete . Jumping in three , two , - one . - Jump . Where is the fleet ? Any ship , Raptor 7-1-8 , please respond . Any ship respond . Any ship , Raptor 7-1-8 , please respond . Any ship respond . - I entered the coordinates right . - Godsdamn him Cap . - Jump us back . - They 'll leave a Raptor behind , right ? That depends . If they don 't want to give away our location ... That true . Cavil 's baseships could be out there anywhere . Exactly . They 'd know we didn 't make it . They 'd leave somebody . Maybe . - Jump drive 's not responding . - What ? What 's the frak ? - Why not ? - Give me a sec . Poseidon , please protect us from death ... Poseidon , please protect ... A Poseidon medal ? - Hey , we 're a long way from water . - It 's a ship , isn 't it ? I know why the drive is not responding . We jumped over the red line . So now we can 't even jump back to where we started ? Our calculations just got nonlinear ! I knew I didn 't recognize these star patterns . You can recognize star patterns with the naked eye ? They 've never sent us so far . I must have frakked up the coordinates . Or you didn 't . If a high energy charge subatomic particle had hit us , it could have randomly flipped one bit of data in our jump coordinates . It got entered correctly , but corrupted . So , something flips from 1 to 0 sends us to parking end of no place . We don 't know where the fleet is and if we did , we couldn 't go there . Cavil 's enemy baseships - could be out there anywhere . - Quiet , let me think . Calculations are nonlinear , but they 're not impossible . But we don 't know where we are . There 's still a chance I frakked up ! Don 't you recognize me , Felix ? It makes sense . There 's a star cluster ... It 's me . Pull yourself together , Lieutenant . - They know where the fleet is . - That 's my point , Sir . There was a false alarm . Everyone has jumped back . Over two days , they 're not here . Just give me a Raptor and a pilot . And what would you do with that ? Jump randomly ? There is something in the universe . Something let us find Earth , dead as it is . And I know , I know I can find Felix . - Lieutenant ... - Me and Felix ... There 's been too much loss already . I 'll have to run it by the old man . Thank you , sir . Thank you . Enough food and water for two weeks if we 're not fussy about recycling , so our limiting factor is ... air . 20 hours 's left . Of course , shuttle-dee-doo . On a Raptor with clapped out CO2 scrubbers , frak you very much . Every breath counts now , folks . We 've got to limit exertion , sleep as much as we can . 20 hours . My Gods . After it thinned the air , pulled it into the tanks , we 're at 68 % ship normal load of O2 . 68 ! At that level , you 're talking memory loss , irrational behavior , - depression , dizziness ... - Better dizzy than dead . Aren 't you frakkin ' lucky to got a mechanic on board ? I 'll have a look at these scrubbers . Alright , let 's see what we got . You 're her ! Godsdammit ! Come on . There 's a loose connection there . I just ... - I just can 't get inside . - Let me do it . - Come on . - No , let me do it . Alright , be my guest . You shouldn 't even be in there . You 're gonna make it worse . - Alright . You see it ? - Yep . Got it ! No pulse , she 's dead . My Gods ! I was just doing that ! I was doing that same thing ! Look at her pliers . The insulating grip has been stripped off . Who did this ? Old as frak . Grip wore off . Or someone didn 't like the idea of a machine breathing their air . What ? Those were mine . - I was supposed to get killed . - Unless you did it . - I mean , you didn 't notice bare metal ? - What ? What are you saying guys ? We 're using up air . - Are you accusing me ? - Shut the frak up ! It was an accident . What are we gonna do with her ? Jettison her . We have to . We can pull air into our tanks and open the door . - No . We 'd lose air . - Only a little . She 's gonna start giving off methane and hydrogen sulfide . No . She 's right . We gotta get rid of the body and then we can figure out what to do next . Flight suits . Give me that . I 've an idea how to get us home , - but I need your help . - What do you mean ? I 'll tell you when they 're asleep . Trust me , okay ? This list ... Some of these people I haven 't seen in a long time . They may already be ... Gods . The Ones , they keep good records . If somebody 's locked up , I can find them . And get them out . We can do this . Really . Buckle in , Lt. Let 's go hunting . This one , Jeremiah , he died in detention , he got sick . And ... She ... She killed herself . But these two ... I got them out . But nobody ... Nobody knows what happened to the child . - I tried so hard . - Hey , you did great . - I tried so hard ! - You saved so many of them . Okay ? I 'm sorry . You can think of more names and we can write more lists . Of course we can . Of course we can . We will . - Yeah . - Okay ? Thank you . Felix Listen . Okay , listen . There 's something I can do . I can interface with the Raptor 's computer and determine the corrupted memory address . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Yeah , wait , I remember you . You did that once ... One of you did that once . It 's who you are , am I right ? But if the others see me doing it , they 'll think I 'm sabotaging the ship , so you 'll have to stand guard . How ? Brooks ? What 's wrong ? Something 's wrong . Hey , wake up . Lethal dose . What 's going on ? - I won 't tell them . - Oh my Gods ! - I heard you moving around . - What did she do ? What did you do ? - I told you she killed the other one . - I won 't say anything . Thanks , buddy . Wait ! He might have killed himself . We don 't know . - That 's it . - And you wanna take a chance ? - We don 't know . We don 't know ! - It 's okay . I understand . It 's okay . It 's okay . There 's nothing here . Frak ! Um , sorry . Spin the dial . I owe Ishay a big favor . Morpha 's a tough get . Go . Feel better . I 'll be waiting . Don 't you recognize me , Felix ? Oh , great , skinjobs . You undid those yourself ? You 're gonna tie me up again ? No . I was gonna untie you . - That 's trusting . Don 't wake them . You 're going home . Really ? It looks like it hurts . - It does . Can you ... ? It 's easier if somebody else ... - Of course . Here we go . Get it in . Oh Gods . Thank you . Oh , there ... It 's making me lightheaded . You all right ? I 'm trying to project , but ... The low oxygen is making everything so hard . Okay , where are you projecting ? You know where I am . I have someone now . Good . You deserve it . You always did . Oh , I 've found it . The bit that flipped . You were right . I can take us home . Memory address 5A25 . Felix , this is it . Get ready to jump . I 'm taking us home . I was happy you guys got together . Been makin ' book on it , for ... Since forever . Took you long enough . - Yeah , well ... He 's got this ... this fire about doing the right thing . A moral core , huh ? You don 't see a lot of that . - No , no , you don 't . Guess it 's ' cause they can get you so killed . Frak me , I 'm sorry , I didn 't ... - It 's okay . Let 's keep looking . Jump completed . Hang on . The jump drained almost all our reserve power . Frak ! Dradis is empty . If the fleet 's here , we 're out of range . I 'll send a pulse . If they 're in this system , they 'll come running , maybe 10 hours . Hey , Finn . Finn ! Azerin ! Wake up , we jumped . We 're almost home . Azurin ? What ? Gods ! Another empty well . - Wanna dig another ? - Yeah , of course . - He wouldn 't give up on me . - You got it . Is this crazy ? Yeah ... I 'm sorry , but yeah . But look , he would give up on you . Eventually , if it didn 't make sense anymore , he 'd have to . He 'd understand . You wanna go home ? Yeah . You stripped the pliers ! I didn 't think he 'd hand them to her , but it didn 't make a difference . You injected Brooks with my morpha ! He started to wake up when I took it and put it back , but you trusted me ! - No , no ! You killed them all ! - We needed the air . - No ! Gods . What ... - Felix . I picked you ... over my own kind ... over my own model . I protected you from something you never could have done but you were thinking all along . I couldn 't . I wouldn 't . No one could ! That is not true . There is a fine line between ignorance and hope . I would have thought you 'd have learned that by now . - What are you talking about ? - Felix ! You have to open your eyes . You have to see what the world is really like ! You gave me the names , Felix ! The rest was easy . Kill everyone on this list . I 'd tell you that they 'd run off ... or ... they were at the infirmary . Some of them I 'd say I saw them eating with their families . " Didn 't you see them ? Oh , I 'm sure you 'll see them tomorrow . " Didn 't you see them ? I 'm sure you 'll see them tomorrow . No . I remember , I saw ... I saw them , I know I saw them . They can 't be ... I saw Jenkins . I saw Penbroke . I saw them . I saved a few ... so you could make yourself not know about the rest ... I saw ... I saw ... Heather Redmond and her baby . They were playing together . I saw them . I know I saw them ... I 'm a woman ... and a Cylon . I didn 't seduce you . Hope seduced you . And the more you ate of it , the less you saw . You ate yourself blind . Why didn 't you just kill us when you knew that we were lost ? I 'm not a monster . I didn 't want to do what I did . I did it when the probabilities dictated it . You kill when you 're in a war . You kill when you have to . You kill the ones your enemy values . It 's basic . You should know that . I trusted you . How could I have guessed ? Baltar did . Oh , what , he didn 't tell you ? Or did you block that out too ? What did you tell them ? That you stayed behind till the grisly end on New Caprica , so that you could , what ? So you could ... You could feed information to the resistance . Who do you think allowed you to do that ? - That 's a lie . - No , it 's not a lie . You think I 'm blind ? You see , I literally had a gun ... pointed to my head . But nobody forced you to play both sides . There 's not much difference between my brain and yours , Felix . We can choose ... to not make the connection ! You can see someone kill in front of you ... twice ... and still hang on to your ignorance . Instead of calling it a flaw , you call it ... hope , or ... faith ... love . So , I 'm asking you Mr. Gaeta ... who is the real traitor in this room ? - I 'm not a traitor . - No , of course , because there are far worse things than being a traitor , aren 't there ? If your friends only knew the truth ... But don 't worry ... I know about your little secret . I know what your Eight did ! Raptor seven-eighteen , Raptor seven-eighteen , you copy ? We did it . She did it . Galactica , come in . Galactica . You 're nowhere near the fleet , baby , but you 're good ! Strange things can happen when you 're away from the fleet . I wouldn 't even trust your own memories on this . And since a human is the sole survivor , the old man isn 't inclined to make an issue out of it and risk the alliance . Sir ... There shouldn 't be an alliance . Cylon technology is gonna keep this fleet moving ' , - Mr. Gaeta . - I need to speak to the Admiral . Why would that be ? Because you 're a Cylon , sir . There 's a meeting later today to discuss some new idea of Mr. Tyrol 's . You can let the Admiral in on your views there . Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . Felix , I don 't understand . Why would you set up a meeting with him ? - I shouldn 't have said it . Forget it . - What are you doing ? Look . You found me and you saved me , so I 'll protect you . But if this doesn 't work out , and if I 'm wrong ... You have a bright future , Louis . What are you talking about ? If what doesn 't work ? Keep your head down . What are you going to do ?

 previously on heroes ... As long as I have breath , anything you love , I will lay to waste . Jessica wasn 't the strong one . It was you .

No ! Caitlin ! it is man 's ability to remember that sets us apart . Caitlin ! we are the only species concerned with the past . peter petrelli montreal Our memories give us voice . They bear witness to history so that others might learn . So they might celebrate our triumphs . And be warned of our failures . Adam . Adam ... I don 't know any Adam . Peter , what the hell was that ? Do you know me ? Of course I know you . Peter , it 's me , Adam . Don 't you remember ? Together we 're going to change history . Sorry , I don 't ... so the haitian 's taken liberties with your mind . Haitian . That explains why you fell off the face of the earth . You can get back your memory . I know how . How ? Healing . You can do what I can do . Which means the mind has to repair itself . How do you suggest I go about doing that ? Think about what matters most to you . Do you know what that is ? His name is nathan . Nathan ? Nathan . you saved the cheerleader ... four months ago so we could save the world . You gotta let me go , nathan ! You go , I go ! No ! I 'll be okay . You can fly , I can 't ! What do you mean ? It 's taking everything in me , all my power not to explode ! Let me go ! Peter ! nikimicah roosevelt hospital , manhattan Sanders ! - Nicole sanders ? - Here . Is my husband okay ? The bullet was less than an inch from his aorta . The surgery was successful . He 's a lucky man . Thank you . Thank you . Help ! Please help ! Keep him alive , okay ? Do whatever it takes , you understand me ? Officer ? Officer , can you help us over here , please ? Did you have to use the full blast on him ? He can take it . He 's not a toy , Elle . He could be . Where am I ? Someplace safe . My brother ... I was in a hospital . We have the finest doctors in the world working on him . But his situation is dire . So who are you ? What am I doing here ? I am an old friend of your parents ' . Yeah , I 've seen you before . And as I said before , you 're safe here . But your brother ... that 's a different story . He almost died . Because of you , peter . Hey , it 's not like it was your idea to go nuclear and take out half of new york city . Oh , you know about that ? Yes , as long as your abilities are in control of you , you will always be a hazard to yourself , to your family ... the whole world . Believe me , if I could turn them off , I would . Don 't worry , we 've done that for you . At least for now . How did you ... my colleague here is able to suppress the abilities in people around him . I don 't understand . What is this place ? You are in a facility designed to help people just like you . Peter , we can help you go back to a normal life . 30 years ago , we had to shut down research on a vaccine which could disable your powers . But due to recent events , we have reinstated that research . And I 'm very happy to say that we 're very close to finding a cure for you . Forever ? You will never have to worry about hurting anyone you love again . How long until it 's ready ? Good ! You 're making the right choice . Good boy . You have hada terrible accident . Peter ... he 's missing . He 's missing , nathan . The coast guard is searching 100 square miles of the ocean . But you 're lucky to be alive . No . Oh , no no no . Dad ! Oh , big guy . I thought I lost you . Girl , I told you . You 're never getting rid of me . Mrs.Sanders ... I 'll be right back , okay ? I 'll be here . Dr.Brooks. Um , I wanted you to know that we don 't have insurance . But I 'm surethat we can come up ... you don 't have to worry about that . It 's all been taken care of . I don 't understand . How ? Who paid ? Uh , that 'd be me . Do I know you ? Call me bob . Did you happen to see a morning newspaper ? What ? No , why ? Not a mention of what happened last night on kirby plaza . Or the untimely deathof our friend mr.Linderman. Who the hell are you ? Someone who wants to help . Linderman made a mess of things and I 'm here to right the ship . So to speak . Okay . You 've done that by paying our bills . No , I meant helping you with your illness . I know you think jessica is gone . How do you know about that ? But we 've discovered that when these abilities manifest , the way the mind deals with the new reality sometimes results in a fracture of sorts . A split personality . No , I 'm finished with jessica . How do you know a new personality won 't emerge ? I can get you all the help you need . The best care in the world . What 's the catch ? The catch is you have to leave your family and enter the program . I just went through hell to get my family back together . I 'm not leaving them now . There is medication you can try at home , but ... but what ? It 's not without side effects . And as you just said , you 've been through so much for your family . Do you really wanna risk ... losing them all again ? So I just take these pills every day ? Yep . It 's a little cocktail they cooked up here in the lab . It controls the abilities . Dampens them . Like that guy who was standing in the corner of bob 's office . The haitian.Yeah. Sorta . So let 's just call them ... haitian pills . Bye , peter . That hurts . You 'll get used to it . And then you 'll start to like it . Hello ? Who said that ? Me . 3 months ago . it 's micah 's birthday today all right ! 11 years old . Almost the man of the house now . Mom ? Did you make a wish , baby ? Don 't tell us . ' Cause you know it 's not gonna come true . You both already know what I wished for , anyways . Micah , we 've been over this . But I 've got it all figured out . I could make the car radio pick up the police band . We could go to the crime scene and be heroes . Or the police could just take care of it . We could be like the fantastic four . Minus one.But still . Micah , I wanna be a hero to you . And I finally figured out how to do that . I think I got a job . A good job . Doing what ? Something that 's gonna make you proud of me , I promise . Come on.I promised I 'd take you bowling , right ? Let 's go . Mom , you coming ? Your mom 's had a long day , micah . Go get your jacket . All I want is to smile at my boy on his birthday , and I can 't even do that . They said it 's just gonna take a little while for the medication to level out . I just don 't know how much longer I can do this . I wanna say things 'll get better . But I know how that sounds . The truth is , they will . You know , it 's been a month . You still haven 't told me your name . Please , I just wanna be left alone . You came to the right place . I have to warn you , though , it does get a bit old . Let me guess . You were living a perfectly ordinary life . Until one day you discovered you could do incredible things . I bet it was wonderful at first . You thought perhaps you could save the world . And then you realized , tragically , that you were dangerous . I 'll let you talk to me after a decade . Oh , actually , talk to me after three . If they wanna leave me in here forever , that 's fine by me . You 've been through something awful , haven 't you ? I 'm sorry . I 'm peter . Hello , peter . It 's nice to meet you . I 'm Adam . 2 months ago . I 'm not in the mood today , Elle . Just a little one ? I 'll up your dose . I 'm fine . Just a little one . Not that a fistful of pills everyday isn 't fun , but ... it 's been two months now and I still don 't know a thing about you . I was just thinking ... maybe there 's more to you than the whole sadistic lightning thing , that 's all . What 's your story ? I liked you better when you just laid there . So you 're not gonna tell me ? What are you , afraid ? No . You just like to be in control . I get it . I figured as much . Sorry I asked.Won 't happen again . I accidentally set my grandmother 's house on fire when I was six . Caused a blackout in four counties in ohio when I was eight . I spent my ninth birthday in a glass room with an iv of lithium in my arm . I 've lived in this building for 16 years . Ever since the shrinks diagnosed me as a sociopath with paranoid delusions . But they were just out to get me because I threatened to kill ' em . I 'm 24 years old , and I 've never gone on a date . Never been on a roller coaster . Never been swimming . And now you know everything there is to know about me . I don 't have the luxury of being more interesting than that . Later , alligator . word to the wise , friend . I would keep my distance from that one . I caved in a desperate moment six years ago , and I 'm still payingthe price . Don 't worry . I don 't want anything from her except the drugs . I 'm sorry , I keep forgetting . You still believe them . What do you mean ? This cure of theirs . They 've been days awayfrom perfecting it since I got here 30 years ago . Bob 's not trying to fix you , peter . No.They created this facility to help us . You 're not in a facility , peter . Look around . You 're in a prison . You don 't believe me ? Why don 't you try getting out ? 2 months ago . Oh , I 'm sorry . Are you all right ? He said it was all a lie . What happened to him , and ... to peter , and the car crash . I take it he told you he thought he could fly . And the piotto blow up new york . That peter was a bomb . It must be the pain medication . You deserve to know this . I tried to keep it from you and the boys . What ? There 's a dark secret in the petrelli family . It started with their father . Delusions of grandeur , paranoia . It lead to his suicide.But sadly ... that disease has obviously been passed down . My god . Now ... nathan 's a great man . And his life is gonna be very complicated . He really deserves his dignity and his ... his privacy . So I hope you understand that this has to be kept secret . Can I count on you for that , heidi ? Hi , what can I do to get you inside a ... hi ... hi.What can I do to get you into a brand new car ? Hi , what can I do ... depends on what you 're gonna do to me once you get me inside . I got a great feeling about your first day . My butterflies have butterflies . Nik , I am so proud of you . I knew that medication would work out . You were right . - I 'm gonna take micah to school . - Okay . You have a great day at work . And when I get home tonight , we 're gonna celebrate . he 's gonna know you 're not taking the stupid pills . Go away , jessica . I don 't need you anymore . What makes you think this is jessica ? Remember me ? That summer that you ran away to L.A.And told everyone to call you gina ? You 're not real . Oh , you 're gonna sell cars ? I 'm going back to L.A.To go play . No , I 'm in control . If I can handle jessica , I can handle you . Then why aren 't you taking your meds ? No ! No ! Look , I need to see my family . Just for a day or two . Yes , I-I think that would be absolutely possible . Just not right now . Why not ? They don 't even know I 'm alive . Look , I could let you go , and you could explode again . You could blow up half the east coast . Okay , so dose meomwith se drugs and I 'll be back before they wear off . It 's perfectly safe . I 'm sorry , peter . You 're just not ready for that yet . Okay , so send someone out with me . Elle , maybe . Uh , no.No , no , I 'm sorry , peter . Um , that 's just not gonna happen . I 'm never getting out of here , am I ? Suddenly the room starts to feel like a cage . I don 't understand . If they 're not gonna help us , why are we here ? To keep us from being out there . Why , because we 're dangerous ? No , peter , it 's because we could save the world . Years ago , I tried to take my abilities public . I thought that if everyone knew that my blood had curing powers , I could help . How naive I was . That 's why they put you in here . Well , if it were possible to kill me , they would have , I assure you . Instead , I 'm locked up in here . When I could be curing your brother . Nathan.How ? Just a small amount of my blood could help to heal him . End his pain . Even after everything you 've put him through . So how do we get out ? My daughter is still in there ! Please ! Please ! Hawkins ! Hawkins , get out of there ! Mommy ! Mommy ! ... Thank you ! yeah , good one , D.L. this is kcei channel 9 news reporting on a house fire , we 've just heard , in the clark county district . Near tragedy was avoided ... dad ! Hey . I saw you on tv ! They keep on playing it over and over ! You really are a hero . I guess I am . Where 's your mom ? I don 't think she 's gotten home from work yet . gone to LA C-ya ! Jessica . 1 months ago . You 're not gonna give me a little jolt ? Why , you want one ? Like you said , I 'm starting to like ' em . Starting to like you . Fine , since you asked nicely . Enough fun for one day ? Day number five without the meds . then I think it 's time to try . Come on , peter . You can do it . It 's nice to finally meet you . You know , for 400 years , you 've held up pretty well . Come on , let 's go heal your brother . Excuse me , chief . I 'm looking for this girl . she 's over there . Thanks . Jessica ! Guess again . Dude , the chick doesn 't know you . She 's my wife . Th.S us stay out of this . Where am I ? Let 's go . Where am I ? We 're going home . How did you find me ? I told you , you ain 't getting rid of me . I love you , baby . Not as much as I love you . Man , let it go . We 're leaving , all right ? Three weeks ago Medal of Valor Can I play with it ? Damon , come on . Why woulasyou k him that ? Don 't be so silly . You 're gonna be all right , aren 't you , sugar ? I don 't know . I think I need to get some help . Anything you want , you just gotta ask . You know that , don 't you ? Thank you . I 've taken care of everything . Plane tickets , money . Now this . I 'm so sorry , nathan . How long until it starts working ? We don 't have time to find out . They 're going to assume that you 'll come to see your brother . This is the first place they 'll look . Come on . Adam , look , look , look ! good . Come on . Come on . that was incredible . His skin was starting to heal right there in front of us . He 'll be as good as new by the time he wakes up . Here , passport . Plane ticket . Here 's the plan . You disappointed me , peter ! And just when I thought we were getting to know each other . There 's a warehouse in montreal . 121 rue saint-jacques . Meet there . Go after him ! You take me back there , I 'm just gonna keep escaping . I 'm not taking you back . You deserve a better fate . Your mother helped me when I was in need . So now you 're helping me ? You must start a new life , peter . I fear this is the only solution . Your secret is safe with me . Go with god , my friend . there are many ways to define our fragile existence . Many ways to give it meaning . But it is our memories that shape its purpose and give it context . Today The private assortment of images , fears , loves , regrets . Thank you . Yeah . for it is the cruel irony of life that we are destined to holdthe dark with the light , the good with the evil . Success with disappointment . This is what separates us , what makes us human . And in the end , we must fight to hold on to . present day I remember . I remember everything . Good , then . Shall we save the world ?

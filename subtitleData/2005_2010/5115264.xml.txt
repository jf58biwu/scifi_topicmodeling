 The call came at 4 a.m. Disaster was heading our way . Time to go to work . Our first priority is secure SEATAC airport , ground all the planes . Someone brings me out of speed . Syd ? The comet ... That 's not a flyby any more . It 's heading right at us . Sir , it just changed course and accelerated again . - A comet cannot change course . - This one has . - Then it 's not a comet ... - The estimated velocity is ? 30.000 km a second . Agent Tom Balwin watched the events unfold from of his son Kyle 's bedside . You 're missing the show . It 's a big comet . Sir . Ryland . Understood . China just launched its missiles at it . Get ready guys , we 're going next . " There has been a launch ! The US military has launched a volley of 24 Titan-2 missiles . " Our missiles are in the air . - England has launched too . - France and Russia . NORAD 's saying the first flight of missiles will intercept in 15 seconds . And the countdown began . From every corner of the earth , we 'd launched our weapons . Multiple hits . I think they got it . What is that ? " NORAD is reporting that at least nine of the Titan-2 missiles have hit their target . - It appears the comet has ... " - No effect . - The comet is still headed right for us . - How hard will it hit ? Something that big , that fast ... You don 't want to know . I 'm scared . I 'm gonna go find my parents , OK ? Hey Dad ? If you 're there , can you pick up the phone ? It 's Diana ... Just tell my brother that I love him . Nancy , it 's dad ... I just wanted to tell you I love you . - It 's entering the atmosphere . - It 's slowing down . It 's leveling off and continuing to lose speed . It 's as if it 's ... - coming in for a landing . - Where is it going ? 47 North longitude . 122 maybe 123 West latitude . That 's by Mount Rainier . That 's our backyard ! The ball of light is massive , 100 , 200 feet in diameter . Jim ? Jim , now ... What 's going on ? We 're not sure what 's just ... just happened . The ball of light is ... is gone . On August 14 , 2004 , 4400 people appeared on the shore of Lake Rainier . This is their story . The 4400 Special : Unlocking the secrets . The 4400 were immediately rounded up and placed in quarantine . For observation and interrogation . - What 's your name , again , sir ? - Julius I was placed on a special assignment to investigate what had happened . Diana Skouris . Tom Baldwin . You too will be one of the teams responsible for investigating - what happened to the returnees . - Skouris . Ex-CDC , right ? Yeah , I heard of you too . But we were unprepared for this challenge . It 's not possible . 4400 people taken at different times and from all over the world , had been returned with no memory of where they 'd been or how long they 'd been gone . So for them , no time has passed . Here look , this is an interesting one . They 're dead , aren 't they ? This is Maia Rutledge . She was the first one to disappear , as far as we can tell . She is 8 years old , only she was born in 1938 . I 'll be OK ... Mostly . She 's a tough little kid . In quarantine , they tried their best to put the pieces together . - The Secretary of State is colored ? - Black . Take your word for it . God , the world sure has changed , since ' 51 ! You should try and relax , son . You 're not gonna get out of here any quicker by wearing a groove in the floor . - You 're some kind of jailhouse philosopher ? - Barracks philosopher , actually . I was a combat pilot in Korea . Nice tattoo . Who 's Lily ? A girl I used to know . We treated you as an equal , but you had to cross the line . I 'd put in for a transfer , if I were you . - Do I look that bad ? - No , it 's ... It 's just you remind me of someone I used to know . - Lily - My friend , her name was Lily , too . Lily Bonham . That 's my grandmother 's name . She died before I was born . You ... You have a family ? Brian and I ... and our daughter Heidi . She was 6 months when I ... 4400 lives were interrupted . But the ones left behind had also suffered . Uncle Tommy ! Hi ! It 's good to see you ! Look , what 's going on ? Nobody will tell us anything . We 'll let you know as soon as we find out . I ... - still can 't believe it 's you . - And how do you think I feel ? Shawn ... Do you remember anything ? Anything at all about ... what happened that night ? Just slow down , ' cause I 'm not driving back to town for another six-pack . You 're just afraid my dad will kick your ass if I come home smelling like beer . Evil cousin Shawn , that 's me . Corrupter of the innocent . Help ! Help , Shawn ! Shawn , help me ! And what about Kyle ? I mean ... he must have seen something the night that I disappeared . Did he tell you anything ? Kyle 's in a comma , Shawn . He 's been like that ever since the night you left . Eventually , it was time to rejoin the world . - Can I help you ? - Heidi ? Heidi , it 's Mummy . - Who ? - Heidi ! It 's ... It 's OK , sweetie . I got it . Brian . Lily ... Why didn 't you come pick me up ? Didn 't ... Didn 't they contact you ? You have to try to understand , Lil . I didn 't think I was ever gonna see you again . I married , Lily . Carol has been a really good mother to Heidi and ... we have a son now , too . I 'm sorry ... Trapped in an unfamiliar world ... But wanting so desperately to pick up what they 'd left off ... The 4400 struggled to find a place where they belonged . But their real work was just beginning . - Thank you . - I really am glad you 're back . Jeez ! The neck 's broken . Even with so many chapters from the past missing ... Each of the 4400 set out create a place for themselves in this time . In some ways , it seemed like fate had a hand in all of it . Lily . Richard ! A baby ? You sure ? I had the doctors do the test three times . There 's no mistake ... You 're definitely pregnant . The thing is ... Brian was out of town when I disappeared , and ... I haven 't been with anyone since I 've been back . I don 't understand ... - How could you ... - I don 't know . There 's some sort of connection between us , isn 't there ? - I feel it . - I can feel it too . Sickle cell anemia ? How can my baby have sickle cell anemia ? Unless the father is black ... Maybe he is . - What are you saying , Richard ? - I don 't know ... Maybe whoever took us used me as some kind of ... donor . It really wouldn 't be so bad , would it ? ... if you were the father . No , it wouldn 't be bad at all . It was as though the 4400 were destined to find their way . - Will you stay here until they come back ? - Of course . - And then can I go home ? - Home ? With you . I don 't like being here alone . - You want to stay with me ? - You don 't like being alone either . Please . Look , Maia ... I 'm not even sure I 'm the kind of person I wanna live with . You know , I ... - I eat cold pizza for breakfast , and ... - That sounds alright to me . Diana Skouris , the adoption of Maia Rutledge is hereby complete , legal and binding . You know , some of us have to look far and wide to find the people we call " family " . You two had the look clear across time . For some , time stood still . A transformation was on the way . And some of the 4400 felt the change from inside . I know this is going to sound strange , but ... That other place we looked at ... The baby didn 't like it . Oh , God ! Lily , what is it ? Somehow , I know what the baby 's thinking . Hey , Iris ! How did we do today ? - I can 't come back here . - What ? Why ? That child ... I 'm sorry . I told her that we wouldn 't be seeing each other for a couple of weeks . Why did you tell her that ? Because she was going to be called for jury duty . She thought I was kidding . A few hours later , her husband called ... And she got a summon for jury duty ? Well Maia , come here . It 's OK . Right . It 's OK . Look who floated in on a ball of light ! - Let him go ! - Shawn ! What did you do to him ? The time had come for the 4400 to learn their purpose . One by one , the 4400 learned about their unique abilities . Their powerful gifts . What are you doing here , Shawn ? Kyle ? How long ... have I been in the dark ? But people fear what they don 't understand ... And no one understood the 4400 . A public backlash was brewing . And the 4400 became the hunted . You got too warm . Come on , let 's look pretty ... That 's better . Maia . How did you do today ? Miss Skouris , can we talk , please ? Well , give us a sec . Can you ? I ... I am late again . Please just ... I 'm afraid you can 't bring Maia back to school anymore . It 's ... It 's the bombings . We can 't risk having her here at school . I 'm sorry . I understand . - It will be OK . - No , it 's not OK . It 's wrong . No , I mean ... someone 's coming who 'll make everything better . We just have to wait a little longer . Jordan Collier was a prominent real estate tycoon , and the most well-known of the 4400 . He had the means to provide sanctuary for his fellow returnees . Do I detect a little romance growing among the 4400 ? You have a good eye . Well , I 'm just happy you two are getting something positive out of all this . Thank you . It 'll pass . Here you go . It 's just morning sickness . You 're pregnant ! Congratulations to both of you ! It 's ... It 's a little more complicated . I wasn 't pregnant when I was abducted . But I was when I got back . You haven 't told your counsellor about this , have you ? We haven 't told anyone . I 'd keep it that way for now . It 's good to see you , man ! What are you doing ? Why are you sitting out here in the rain ? What are you staring at ? They won 't leave me alone . Asking me questions ... - Staring at me all the time ... - They 're just glad to have you back . My mum did the exact thing to me . I 'm going inside . - I 've reading to do . - You 've got reading to do ? Uneasy about my discovery , I can fight it in Marco Pasela , my friend and colleague in NTAC . Respecting Maia 's privacy is no small thing , but you got to weight that against the information that could be in that diary . If Maia 's having visions , you should know about it . " Miss Oster , next door , is gonna have a kitten . " " I hope she does me play with it ... " " There 's gonna be a book about how we all ... " " Me and Diana get to be a real family ... " " A computer for Christmas ... " " Mommy 's bosses will be punished for betraying us . " I need to clear my head and get away for a while . I guess what I 'm asking is ... if I could stay here for a while ... Shawn , you 're one of the 4400 . As far as I 'm concerned , you can stay here as long as you want . Thank you . So ... Tell me a little more about this ... ability of yours ... What are you doing ? I 'm not Kyle Baldwin . - You good to go ? - Just give me a sec . - You 're leaving now ? - Yeah , but don 't worry , sweetheart , 'cause I 'll be back before you wake up , alright ? Better go . Bye . Diana . Don 't worry . Your son , Kyle . He 's the answer . The answer to what ? Everything . How far away is this safe house ? It 's about 30 miles . No ! Highland Beach . - Hey ! - Kyle ! No ! Calm down ! - We have to go there now . - What 's at Highland Beach ? - That 's where Shawn disappeared . - I have to go back there . If that 's you want , we will take you . What are you looking for ? Maybe we can help you , Kyle . You 're not my son , are you ? Kyle was meant to be a channel ... a way to communicate . Communicate with who ? With you . To guide you in your duty with the returnees . But something went wrong . Shawn interrupted the process . Who are you ? What are you ? I 'm human . I come from a different time . Your future . So why you took them ? - We needed them . - For what ? To survive . In my time , humanity is dying out . Only those we took can prevent the catastrophe from happening . That 's why they 've been all turned and see back into the timeline . They 've already begun their work . And you 've began yours . Dad ? - Kyle ... - What are you doing here ? - Where is ... Where is Shawn ? - Kyle ? Dad , what 's going on ? It 's the baby . At this time ? I get the car . A new life was ready to enter this world . Something extraordinary was coming into its own . When the news about the 4400 and their mission became public , Jordan Collier seased the opportunity at hand . He established the " 4400 Center " . A place where the returnees could share their gifts . Hello , Peter . I 'm Shawn . What do you say if we started ? Try and relax . It 's OK . - Is he really cured ? - Take him back to his doctor . Run some tests . Peter 's leukemia is gone . - That book is blasphemy . - It 's just a book . It 's the doorway to hell . - This child is yours ? - She 's my daughter . Abomination begets abomination . You saw happened . That was Isabelle . We both know it and there 's no use to put it between us . Whatever Isabelle does , she does it out of love for us . - She 's our daughter , Richard . - I know she is . I love her quite back . But she 's someone too now , and I wish I goddam knew what there was . What is it ? What 's wrong ? I 'm fine . Isabelle 's astonishing power was not last on Jordan either . He knew she was the key for a great wisdom . Who is this special girl ? Look at him with Isabelle . Things keeps so , we 're gonna have to start call him " Uncle Jordan " . He 's already taken to it . Welcome to the revolution , little lady . Still , there was so much left unexplained ... I don 't know who I got to that store . I just can remember breaking any window . Not remembering is not an excuse . And stop telling me somebody spiked your drink . The police ran tests , Kyle . There is no JHB in your system . - What else could it be ? - You spent 3 years in a comma , you have no business drinking anything ! OK , so I screwed up , and sorry , and then what do you want ? - Didn 't you see this was serious ? - I 'm going to bed . No . You won 't make up for last time . Kyle , I get it , I get it . But we need to talk about some rules for you . I 'm not a kid , I do not need rules . Just go upstairs , Kyle . Just go upstairs . I 'm blacking out . I 'm losing chunks of time . It 's like they did something to my wiring . They ? Kyle , who you talked it about ? See Monshu . They took Shawn and put me in a comma . They left me messed up inside . Man , you 're scaring me . How do you think I feel ? Tom struggles with Kyle and the job were taking their tool . Here , Tom was giving up when he met Alana Meleva . a 4400 with the power to create dream worlds where the most wonderful fantasies could come true . Thomas . They gave you this relationship as a source of strength . To sustain you in the trial settling ahead . Tom and Alana had fallen in love . And their relationship would carry over into his reality . So let me see if I bet this ... straight . You two met , fell in love and spend 8 years together in some kind of ... alternate reality . And now you 're here with 8 years of love and marriage at your belts , and what to us was ... no time at all . Yeah , that ... That about sums up , yeah . I feel it all . He 's gonna die . I saw it , he 's gonna die . That man we watched on TV once . Him ! Jordan Collier ? Someone 's gonna kill him . Fascinating . What an extraordinary gift . You are clear on what we 're telling ? Your daughter has quite a track record when it comes to seeing the future . Her latest vision involves my death . I leave anything out ? No , that about covers in . Collier has name on the side of a skyscraper about the time he was 30 . You pursue power that rules so you pick up some enemies all along the way . Or maybe this comes from someone that Collier 's never met . I mean , if you hate the 4400 , killing a figure , that 's a good way to make them suffer . But what are we supposed to do ? The potential victims refuse to your help ! Jordan turned that Isabelle feel a clue about his fate . If you know anything ... now it would be a good time to tell Uncle Jordan , right ? With the glimpse of a bright future ahead , he carried on with his plan to reunite the 4400 . The reunion goes forward . All the guests check out so far . We secured the surrounding roofs after bombs with . So now , it 's ... cross your fingers time . I 'd like you to please welcome my mentor ... My friend , Mr. Jordan Collier . Thank you . And thank you Shawn , for that great introduction . Jordan ? - Above there ! - Go ! Everybody stay down ! Oh , God ! Shawn . She told me to go through it . Who did ? Who did ? She lied . Don 't go ... Don 't ! He had a vision ... to save the future . And he gave us that vision . And now he won 't be here to ... see us achieve it ... But we will achieve it . Thank you for coming . Bye . Nice words , Shawn . I think Collier would have approved it . Maybe your side and my side can work together now that I 'm assuming my new duties around here . You becoming quite a little politician , Shawn . Now I know Collier would have been proud of you . He 's gone ! His body ... It 's not there ! Someone stole the body . I remember all of it . But it just feels like somebody else has these memories . They are . You weren 't under control of your actions , Kyle . You did not kill Jordan Collier . How long you think I 'll be put away for ? I can 't live like this any more . I go through every day trying to pretend I 'm normal , but it 's just a cover up . I can 't let you do it , Kyle . It 's over dad . No more lies . I can 't do it anymore . I just can 't do it . OK , you can ' stop me . The future had led a heavy burn on those it touched . There was nothing to do , but carry it . Hello Mr. Ross . Did you have a good flight ? Yes , thanks . This is supposed to be coming from me ? I don 't even understand half a word it says , it doesn 't sound like Lucy . So change it . You 're the boss . Why don 't you dictate something to me ? No press statement . If the press wants to know what 's Mr. Farrell 's thinking , they can watch " 60 minutes " like the rest of America . I 've already booked an exclusive interview with our new face of the 4400 . That 's all for now . Thanks . I 'm sorry I 've just been like that . I thought you could use a hand . Mathew Ross . What are you doing in Seattle ? Jordan made it clear that in event of his death , I was to stay back front and so I could help you out . The ground just shifted under your feet . You have to find the ability to full on your ass . Sweetie ... Mrs. Benke is gonna be here in a minute . It 's time to get up . I don 't feel good . You 've got a real fever , young lady . Hey , how did you have that ? Shawn , we make you rearrange your healing schedule . Something 's going on . Some sort of illness spreading among the 4400 . I know about it . All over the world , the 4400 were contracting this strange illness . And in an effort to prevent infection among the general population , NTAC rounded up the 4400 and put them back in quarantine . " Quarantine " . That 's an evocating word , these days . It recalls plenty of images of secret prisons and ... What 's the euphemism we 're using now ? " Coercion tactics " ? Let me ask you something . You have some doctors and staff here , right ? Been having any luck getting the cause of this thing ? - Not yet . - Then get out of your soapbox . You want an image to hold on , then try this one : 4400 dying on rows . I think what my partner means to say is our to organizations need each other . We should cooperate . - Diana , you want to see me ? - Kevin Burkhoff . I 've been doing neuronal research on the 4400 . I 've heard of you . Everybody here has . Here 's some very interesting data on the blood work I 've been doing . Have a look . See if it would help you figure out what 's going on with this disease . - Oh thank you . - And can I expect to see your work ? The research we do here is ... is classified . Max , if ever there was a time to bend the rules a little , I think it might be now . Well , it 's not a waking the nudge situation , Diana . I give you the classified documents , I go to jail . Yeah , and if you don 't , people might die . Are you implying we 're not doing everything we can ? We 've got dozens of doctors working around the clock . They try to solve this thing . They 're medical records , Marco , not national secrets . Wrong . They 're medical records AND national secrets . That is why they keep them in a database you need six passwords to get into . You know , it 's weird . Hundreds of people are sick . Do you think they don 't want any help they could get ? Then we 're going to get this help . Whatever they want it or not . Gotcha . That thing that 's killing them ... It 's not a disease . It 's a side effect . Dr. Burkhoff , just calm down . What are you talking about ? - A side effect of what ? - I don 't know exactly , but I do know this : There 's a synthetic substance present in the blood of every 4400 . All the ones I 've tested . Every medical report you gave me , sick ones , well ones , doesn 't matter . They all have it . They even gave it a name . They call it " Promicine Inhibitor " . " P.I. " " Promicine Inhibitor " . Everyone was getting it . Every time they came to NTAC medical . Every check up . We did it to them , Tom . We made them sick . Diana . What ... What the hell are you doing ? We 've got some things we need to talk about , Max . I was ordered to work on a drug to suppress the production of promicine in the 4400 . Promicine is basically a backstage pass to the VIP section of the brain . I ran some tests on the 4400 who were still in quarantine . Every single one of them is producing great amount of promicine . So it 's just a matter of time before every 4400 develops telekinesis ? Promicine 's behavior is unpredictable . They might not get telekinesis , but they 'll get something . Once I synthesized the inhibitor , we gave it to every 4400 . Every time they came for a check up . But it doesn 't even work , 4400 are developing abilities all the time . A small percent of them are . But if it wasn 't for the inhibitor , they 'd all have them . A vaccine was created by extracting promicine from the one 4400 who hadn 't been given the inhibitor . Hey sweetie . It 's me , Tom . Who are you ? Time was running out for the sick ones in quarantine . Seven had already died and the others were fading fast . She has woken up . Only a few minutes . Did she said anything ? She talked about you . She said you gonna make everything OK . I hope she 's right . We can flush it out of their systems . Remove the inhibitor , the immune system functions . That 'll happen virtually instantly . - So this substance ... - Promicine . It 's what makes you people unique . How did you get it out of my daughter ? She has trace amounts of it in her bloodstream . Before the inhibitor , you all did . That 's how they found it in the first place . But ... She 's an infant . And I could only draw enough blood ... To make one shot . If you get it there in the quarantine ... One shot may be all they need . Hi . Got some medicine for you . One by one , the 4400 were healed . When the inhibitor removed , their potential was infinite . Those who had hardened their way would face the consequences . Trusted allies were exposed . It was the time for a new discovery . Untapped abilities surfaced . Isabelle ? A revelation came on every corner . Hello , Shawn . I 'm Isabelle . Looks like mummy 's gonna get a whole bunch of new bosses . I hope they go away for a very long time . I 'll be in the front for the earings . Well I 'll been sitting next to you 'till the whole thing 's over . Nothing 's over . It 's just starting . Sweetie , what are you talking about ? What 's starting ? The war . The 4400 are getting stronger . It 's going to come down to us against them . We are in a war . The 4440 . The season you can 't miss !

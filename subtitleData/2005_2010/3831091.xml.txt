Come out , you despicable coward ! Hazyr was busted . Got in somebody 's way . What 's in it for us ? I want to know where the wind is blowing from . Forsaj , you used to work with Hazyr . What can you say ? So what then ? Hazyr got coco from me , paid little - half the price . Because of friendship . Same time he was pushing defective cars as quality goods . - That 's all . - Not so fast . I 'm not pining nothing on you . Just interested . Because of friendship . D 'you hear that besides Hazyr and his men ... a few dozen armed militants were killed there ? - We know . - So , two questions arise : where did the militants come from and who killed them ? Excuse me , please . We must talk . A matter of business . I 've come to talk to Matvey . Who is this ? How did he get in here ? Whose are you , lad ? A son of one of the guards ? - Are you Matvey ? - Listen , dog , who are you speaking to ? Have you lost your senses ? Can 't see who you 're talking to ? Quiet down , quiet down . Walter , ping the guards , let them send this puppy on his way . You have no more guards . Don 't bother calling them . Subscriber is temporarily unavailable ... Kid , do you even understand where you are ? Before whom you 're standing and what you 're carrying on about ? Now give this kid a minute of your attention . - Hello ? - Rita ? - Yes ! - Give your phone to Fragile . - What Fragile ? - He 'll come over right now .

Now a word to the company president , Viktor Pokrovsky . Dear friends ! For all of you it is no secret ... that our games , with which we are holding today 's tournament ... - A sponsor ? - Yeah . are analogues we 've developed to the famous Counter Strike and Virtual Fight . What crap is that ? Couldn 't do a normal tournament in Counter ? A question arises : can we independently produce games ... which will not only compete with the overseas models ... but will exceed them in quality ? Let 's kick the ass of bourgeoisie ! I hear your sarcasm , but I don 't agree with it . Now pay attention ! Today , in addition to cash prizes ... the lucky winners will receive a copy of our newly developed game ... by the name of Virtus Antiteror ! And let the strongest win ! Good luck to you all ! - Doc , Mosquito , ready ? - Yes ! Start ! - Two into zig .

Do you like gypsies ? My grandmother was a gypsy . She foretold that I will say " no " to the champion . Don 't give up , champion . - Didn 't they give you a disk ? - I already have one . Skolsky is in the loop . He 's already working on it . Let 's see , what we get . Experts don 't exclude the possibility that the crisis will cause air transport to shrink by 20-30 % . - Max , is that you ? - Yes . Where did you go without the keys ? - You know that I work night shift tonight . - Well , Mom , I got delayed . I won a fighting tournament ! And I thought you were done with that .

When cutlets cool , give one to the cat . And don 't sit too long at the computer or your eyes will be tired later . - Alright , Mom . Bye . - Bye . - And don 't go to bed too late . - Okay , got it . ... in aviation we will find out very soon . The first order came from an unknown entrepreneur in Russia . Now regional news . The massive building project in the suburbs of Nizhny Novgorod , which has been frozen for more than 10 years ... will be restarted in coming months . The investor for this building project is the great holding of Terranko . The President of the holding Sergey Zaritsyn will say more about the project . We are restarting the construction of a factory that was frozen at the end of the 90s ... a factory for processing of technological waste ... You 're a lazy ass , Bill . Matroskin your age had a cow , but you 're still idling . Catch a mouse at least . ... the ecological situation in the region . Change it radically . I think it is time for money ... to work towards the benefit of our livelihood as a goal . Excuse my sentimentality . Hello , Nizhny Novgorod ! This is the Fat Dancing Hamster speaking to you ... and I am reading your greetings . " Big hello to the staff of the hotel Nijegorodskaya ... and also hello to my favorite girl . " " We now relaxing , listening to your station after work , " Veronica writes to us . Great idea . Keep relaxing to our music again and again .. " Big salute to all the designers ... who find inspiration on your radio waves . This is Ironka . " " A big salute to my favorite wife Alyonka Fonina . I love you so much . Your teddy bear . " " A super-super big hello to the teaching faculty ... " Here , take it . First time I 'm seeing this . Did you put it in the oven or something ? I started a game . I know your games . You hands are all crooked , all the same - upgrades ! What the ... ? My comp 's under warranty ! Can 't you just replace the parts ? If I rip your heart and brains out , could you replace them ? Forget the CD drive . You 've killed the motherboard , burned the stone ! Easier to buy a new one now . Hey , you , eggheaded humanoid ! I 'm going to knock your brains out , got it ? Go change the parts or get me the manager ! - Hello , Mosquito . - Huh ? ... Oh , hello . - Buy a new one and don 't mess with it yourself . - Freak . Hunchback cowboy . - So , comp also got busted ? - Yeah . I started this bloody " Virtus . " - The disk from the tournament ? - Yeah . Totally bummed out . O , familiar faces . What ? Also , comp in shambles ? You both had this ? Yeah , the speakers nearly exploded . I thought Rita and I would go deaf . - And then the room seemed to dissolve ... - I had the same thing . Academic Town : Institute of Alternative Energy Sources Is the project not moving ? Yes . We spent the grant money on the creation of an exemplary product ... but the project cannot move any further without serious investments . Holding Terranko became interested in our technology ... but their experts consider investments to be pointless . Why ? Dad , spend hundreds of millions to get a return only 20 years later ? Please . Our exemplary product is ready for use . Volodya , leave us for a minute . Here is the key element . For now it 's only a model . Technology for the production of palladium bars is nearly fully developed by us . We have only left to increase the absorption capacity ... and this element will be able to absorb about 600 volumes of hydrogen . Can you be more specific ? How far will a car go ? A small car - 1000 km . And how much is needed for the creation of a test sample ? About a half a billion . - Are you not well ? - It 's nothing . You 're mistaken to not believe in it . Hydrogen supply is endless . You create this element ... and you have in your hands once and forever an unlimited source of energy . Beautiful ! I will send them the money . Dad , I have a computer in my head . You can throw away hundreds of millions and make one element , but the practical realization of the whole project ... will require investments that will bring a return in one case only : palladium must be available to investors at low price . You know everything , computer . Sergey . How is the plan coming along ? Everything is in order , Boris Sergeevich . Transit stop is ready . On Monday we expect the first batch of tourists . No changes . - When is the first payment ? - It 's already here . Fura will come on Monday . This is great ! Let 's buy bikes ? Or , maybe Harleys ? Pay for the apartment , buy a new computer , and use the change to get a Harley bandana for each ? Rita , don 't start it . There will be another tournament . Are you thinking about college ? So I 'll graduate and sit in an office for $ 500 a month ? Are tournaments better ? Also cash , but with fun . Let 's go shoot ! Hello . Need money ? Or we don 't have a lot , we won 't be offering for long . Oh ! Beretta ! So where do we shoot to win the teddy bear ? - Into the Nazis . - Where ? Hit all the Nazis without a single miss . Oh , so those are Nazis . Could 've put pins instead . Didn 't have any . This is totally unreal . Park the Maybach . - Dima , what 's with your eyes ? - And yours ? There exist several different ways of influencing the brain to increase its activity : psychotropic , hypnotic , electromagnetic and ultrasound . That 's probably enough . On each of the subjects you will need to write a short paper prior to taking the exam . - Yes ? - Which one is the strongest ? Today ... the most powerful is the psychotropic . But in the U.S. experiments have been conducted with electromagnetic ... and bio-resonance impacts to the brain , during which ... the cerebral activity of the subjects was increased by many times over . People discovered abilities that up until now had been only in an embryonic stage ... and without any side effects . That 's it for today . I remind you again : without the papers you will not be admitted to the exam . Oleg , but we had agreed that you will drive me ? Yes , I am standing here waiting for you for two hours , and you are in training . Ok , that 's it . Bye . I 'm taking the bus . Sorry . Miss , excuse me , do you have a jack or a wrench ? - No . - Excellent . So you can 't whack me on the head for hitting on you . You don 't recognize me ? Come on , your gypsy grandmother foretold that you will say " no " to the champion . - Oh , yes . Hi . - At the tournament . - Maxim . - Maxim . We 're walking together , but I still don 't know your name . Lena . I 'm going to the bus stop . - Are you studying at our university ? - Starting next semester . I just transferred here . It 's only been two months since my mom and I moved here . - From where ? - From Vilnius . Mom was offered a job here . So you haven 't been long here ? No guy or girl friends here yet ? I propose we fix that . Two bus stops further from here there 's a good coffee place . Shall we stop by ? You can tell me where to buy such perfume . I 'll perfume my cat , so it reminds me of you . Maxim , I 'd be happy to , but I already have a guy . Cool . I just got a baseball bat . Where does he live ? I wouldn 't advise it . He is a kick boxer . Yura , what are you standing around for ? Work your feet ! Oleg ! Coming . Another minute . - Congratulate the champion . First place . - Hello , champion . Good job ! I told you if you work , everything is gonna be okay . Shall we celebrate ? - Hello ? - What restaurant " Caravan " ? - You 're going to the " Caravan " ? - What friend from the university ? OK , I 'll come . Do you know , where restaurant Caravan is ? What restaurant ? It 's a nasty ghetto . Not far from here . Max , you couldn 't choose a place a little more decent ? The best coffee is here . Baby , d 'you want to go to a movie ? Want to go bowling ? We 'll go bowling . Sister ? Bring your sister . Sure , yeah . I 'm quite the money printer . No , no , that wasn 't to you . Alright . Talk to you later . Vaja , leave her . Look what Fatima just walked in . Why pointless to study here ? I 'm majoring in psychology . We have excellent teachers . - I 'll go see . - Go on , go on . In economics there may be good ones too , but it 's not what I want to do . Mom made me enroll . But I want to do jewelry design . In Vilnius we had a very good school , but here I can only find a studio ... Hello . I 'm not interrupting ? I am a former chef of this restaurant . There 's food poisoning almost every day here . - You didn 't order oysters by any chance ? - No , my friend and I are only here for coffee . I 'm also here with friends . We 're resting after work . We work at the " Kid 's World " in the department of inflatable boats . Can you imagine ? We inflated 40 boats today ! See my lips are all swollen . Listen , student , why don 't you get us some fruit ? Listen , we ... You have no money ? Put it on my tab . We both want to sit and talk just the two of us . We also want to sit together . Get to know each other , right ? Listen , I 'm really asking you , go back to your friends . I am not going to talk to you anyways . And you don 't want fruit ? No , I don 't want fruit . Thank you . Then grind on some nuts , please . Today the coffee wasn 't made well . Run ! Stop ! Guys , have you seen anything like this ? Oleg ! Come quickly to the Caravan , they 're killing us here ! Oleg ! Lena , come out . It 's me , Maxim . Everything is alright . - Let 's go . - Wha ... A friend from special forces helped me . Stop , Oleg ! It wasn 't him . This is my friend from the university ! Those guys are in the cafe ! Max , I 'll see you later . Thanks for everything . Go . - Oleg , they were just talking ! They ... - Give him another blow . That 's enough , don 't ! Oleg , Oleg , stop . Stop , stop . This is Vaja , the brother of Hazyr . - Oh , Vaja . Hello . - Hi , Rashid . - Who did that to you ? - A bird flew into me . Is it working ? It 's working . Aslan , what is he talking about ? Is he stoned ? Or high ? - Hazyr . - Hazyr what ? A student-kid , a nerd by the looks , took down the 4 of us , got it ? - Like that guy ... - Bruce Lee . The chick of Oleg , kickboxing coach , said that he 's studying with her at the same university . The university on Lenin Street . Tomorrow we 'll drive over and wait for him . What do I have to do with it ? One wimpling took out 4 guys . Should I lend you some fighters ? Or lend you some balls ? So you 'd have a bit more courage ? I 'll keep my balls . Someone 's got to make children . We need something different from you , Hazyr . Well ? We need to use your oven . Hello , Doc . Getting it on in Counter ? Speaking of Counter , think where can we get paintball shells . We 're gonna play life . Let 's shoot 3 to 2 at the construction . Long is out . Now after Doc . Cover me ! Leave it . Draw out Doc . - Minused me , the vermins ! - It 's who you 're playing with ! Now Doc and Mosquito will do them in . Mosquito minused ! Vampire , go ! Doc minused ! The round is ours ! The crap I hid ! Yeah . You should 've hid from the bullet . Look at your head . I am completely going off the wall . How did you find out ? At the firing range I didn 't get it at first , but then ... Rita in the car on the way home gave such a show . She 's a racer in gaming . They turned on the disk for her on the spot . I got behind the wheel and realized that I can do with the car everything , like in the game ! Listen , do they even know in that " Virtus " what they slipped to us ? Oh , sure . If they knew , they 'd be on to us . There 's probably just some virus in there or the program got screwed . Peoples , put the comps aside ! We 're playing life ! Let 's join the special forces . All the terrorists are dead meat ! Guys , we also used to play Mortal Combat . - Who can do the most ? - Hold this . Mosquito , come spar with me . Thai boxing . What ? Hey , hey , hey ! Yes , Max . Hello , Vampire ! Listen up what just happened ! Remember , all our comps got fried ? From those disks we won at the tournament ? So , something 's happened to me after that . I won 't tell you on the phone , you won 't believe me . Let 's meet tomorrow at 2pm next to the university ? Where is he ? I ate the whole package already . I have more . If you litter in my car , you 'll be cleaning it with your noses . To hell with your Max . The guy 's a loser . What do we need him for ? He also got the disk . And also I heard that yesterday in Caravan a guy took out 4 guys . - Getting the picture ? - Getting it . There 's your Batman . Hi , Max . Here he is , bitch . Max ! - Max ! - Stay ! Everyone , stay ! That 's Vaja , brother of Hazyr , and his men . You wanna get involved with gangsters ? - We 'll annihilate them ! - Who ? The entire gang ? Hush , everyone ! We follow them and then call the cops . - So where are they taking him ? - Looks like to Hazyr 's base . Come on , come on . Some more . Hazyr 's auto service . Call the cops and let 's get out . As if you don 't know what Hazyr does and how cops profit from it ... He pays the cops for documents on stolen cars . - They 'll never come here in their life . - So what do you suggest ? Can we play life only at the construction site ? - That 's all . Good ! - Stop , stop . Timur , go to the post . We 're here . Why are you here in broad daylight ? A van came . I have people here . Get this crap out of here ! - Where do I put it ? - Anywhere , ... and I don 't want to see any of you here before night . Into the locker . Stay there , scum . They locked Max , closed the doors , the jeep drove off . Besides Hazyr , there 's 3 more . A van just arrived . They 'll steal the car . The van will be unloaded now . International Center of Evil for changing oil . Not feeble , Doc ? I laugh at your " not feeble . " - Mosquito , Long ? - Let 's go shoot ? That 's right , shoot . Fine shooter . What if they have weapons there ? And what do we have ? Crayons ? Get out , everything 's fine . - Hazyr ? - Hazyr , Hazyr . - Salaam aleykum , Hazyr . - Aleykum salaam . - Ruslan . - Get them out . The dinner 's getting cold . Come out ! Straight then left ! Weapons and personal belongings with you , the transport is leaving ! Two hours to eat and rest ! Another 300 kilometers to the base . Be quick ! Hit guards on the eyes from markers , finish them off in hand combat . - Mosquito and Long come with us . - And I ? You stay in the car . - Am I not in the game or what ? - Yan , you cover our rear . Listen , if the doors are closed , how do we get in ? There 's another entrance . Everything is cool here . You can feel safe . I 'll leave you . The food is homemade . Eat , eat . - All clear . - We won 't encounter any guns ? We 'll surrender immediately . Hey , where are you going , huh ? Hey ! Oh ! 1 : 1 . To start this swallow we need to turn off its brain ... and connect it to ours . - How many people in the shop ? - Hazyr ! - Anyone else ? - Maximum 2 . - Are you sure ? - I swear on my mother ! Open the door . Who 's that ? I don 't get it , do they have guns or what ? I don 't have a mother . Gabella . Enjoy your meal . Doc , the tank , run , attack . Disperse ! Shoot with aim ! - Where 's Ruslan ? - Minused one ! Help Doc ! Frag ! You , follow me ! Right here , behind the crates ! Move to the exit ! Grab the center ! Round is ours ! Everyone down . - Anybody left ? - All clear . - Guys , is that you ? - Yes , Max . - Vampire , get me out of here . - Just a sec . We stirred something dangerous here . How many frags did you get ? - I got 6 . - I got 7 . - 6 . - We 're even . Minus one behind the crate . I have more now . Have you gone nuts ? What frags ? We 're taking Max and getting outta here . - How are you ? - Like a big moth . Doc , a knife . - Who are they ? - Foreigners , Max , foreigners . Guys , did you do that ? We did it , Max . With crayons . We 'll teach you too later . Dima , what 's going on ? What happened there ? I 'll tell you later . Let 's go , Yan . Max , let 's go ! Listen , what if they come after us later ? They 'll get tired in the attack . Long , give me the keys . - Here . - Keep the guard busy . - What erring ? - The 45th . - Pretend to be tipsy . - Okay . - What the ... - Hello . Polkan . Polkasha . Go ! Hello , uncle Borya ! Oh ! Hi , hi , Kostya . - It doesn 't start ? - Ah , to hell with it . Should we warm it up ? That 's the thing ! I need to talk to you . Alright , go on , sit down . I ... want to buy a boat . A boat ? It depends on what you need the boat for . To take out girls for a ride , it 's one boat . To catch fish , it 's another one . For fishing a kazanka boat will be enough for you . But to take out girls for a ride - we don 't have such . Donzi yachts ! But we here only have the simple stuff . - Shall we try it out ? - Let 's have some slowly . Vampire . A device for you . - Ok , Max , why are you sulking ? - What are you doing ? Forget it . You crippled 4 yourself yesterday . Have you lost your senses ? Comparing what I did to what you did ! And if we didn 't do it , where would you be right now ? I don 't know . But you killed so many people . Max , good people don 't hide at auto service shops with a bunch of guns . Who are they then ? Terrorists ? No , they 're the Green Peace . They 've come to Nizhniy Novgorod to save the sheep . Only one sheep is left , and it 's bleating before us now . You all go to hell ! - What 's wrong ? - Guys , do you understand it 's no longer a game ? We need to call the cops . Exactly ! Just call and say : " Excuse me , we just killed 100 men . Here are the weapons . Where do we go now ? " Max , quit whining . You 're just like us . Because of you we got involved in all this and it 's not clear how it will go from here . - Forget him . - We must be prepared for anything . Anyways , decide now : either you 're with us and you quit whining or get out of here and forget everything that you saw . Why standing around ? Come help us ! Doc , look . It ' like I 've had this all my life . Give it here . C 'mon . Yan , stay on guard , ok ? What , again ? Victor Petrovich , this is Skolsky . We agreed that I will track the teens and will not get involved . They created a massacre . I will send you the video files and would like to be paid for everything at once . So . You will send the file through the office using our channel . Boris will give you the money . What did they do ? Made a big mess ? Three more cars are on their way . Okay , we 're waiting . Bring more criminologists . There 's such a butchery in here . I think we 'll be here till morning . Yes ? Alright , that 's all . Palych . Look what we found . What 's that thing ? Yes , we haven 't had anything of this magnitude in a long time . What are you talking about ? The hangar is full of mercenaries . - Special forces did this , you can see right away . - It seems , here they are . Colonel Sergei Lebedev . Who is conducting the investigation ? Colonel Strelnikov . We just started . - You finish it right now too . - Yes , but ... No " buts " . Carry out the order . Allow me ? - Yes , Sergei . - Boris Sergeevich ... I have made the local police drop this case . Special forces were not involved in this operation . The situation is strange . It 's not a pretty situation , Sergei . In a week Viliermo flies in , and I promised to show him the first group of tourists . The best fighters , the elite . And what frigging elite is this , if they were all annihilated like a bunch of chickens ? - Any foreign bodies there ? - No . People were killed from their own weapons . Part of the weapons is missing . Battle was started with weapons that are not used by any special forces in the world . Bows and arrows ? Almost . Hello , Dad ? I 'm turning off the phone till tomorrow . Yes , I am tired . I 'm going to bed at 9 : 00 p.m. Pull ! Pull ! It 's the neighbors watching soccer on cable . - Pull ! - I don 't know , they 're screaming something . - How 's Mom ? - Where is the paintball ? Alright , alright . He 's neurotic , psycho . You guys promised us something . It 's all coming . Mosquito ! Could you pause your honeymoon ? Let 's go make coffee ? Champagne ? Your sleeves are short , or are your arms long ? Damn , I asked you not to scream ! That 's enough . The key is grind it into powder . Listen , is the real coco also sweet ? Do I know ? - What 's the frigging difference ? - What if these dogs have tried it before ? They 'll discover our bluff and will bug us to death ? We 'll say that we ourselves were cheated into some glucose . Give here the package . Stay here a minute . I 'll be right back . You go too . Go , go . - Hanging out ? - Yes , my parents left for St. Peter . - Why did you call me ? - Well , not for the chicks . You 're our family man . - Very funny . - Let 's go for a ride . To talk business . Moving on to the next court ! Do you recognize this ? Well yes , it 's the 98th . I have 30 of these . Used to have 35 ? Colonel Lebedev . Hello . Hello . Ouch ! What are you doing ? Look , this is scopolamine , the " truth drug " . You will tell me everything about this marker one way or the other . If you tell with the injection , you 'll get a sentence for complicity in crime . Without the drug - I will leave and will forget that you exist . Choose . I 'm Oleg Skolsky to see Boris Victorovich . He 's expecting me . Go in . He 's coming up . The company is liquidated . Only connection to the server remains . Is everything here ? Well , photos , videos , phone conversations . - You owe me another $ 5,000 . - What ? Unforeseen costs . - Really ? - I had to pay someone to shut them up . Should I reimburse for gas and McDonalds too ? We had agreed on a sum . You got everything . But I paid out of my own pocket relying on Pokrovsky to return me the money . Well then he will return it . I 'm afraid that we will not see each other . Then I have to take the money from where I left it . Let happen what may . Good day . Wait ! Why so suddenly ? Five ? Besides paintball , any other clues ? Your boys are themselves a clue . We gave the natives ( police ) lemons ( money ) , told them it 's a new kind of pineapple . Well , the natives will be dealt with . What 's this about ... We 've arrived . So why did we come here ? Do you know whose house this is ? Am I supposed to know all the houses ? Why did you bring me here ? This is the house of Arsen Matveev . Matvey . My dad runs a canned food factory . Matvey provides the protection for it . Well ? Tomorrow Matvey is having a gathering , I overheard a random conversation . Hazyr is out . So there 'll be a re-distribution of power in the city . What do we care ? Or is your dad going to give you less pocket money ? Don 't you think it 's time to start making money ourselves ? - I 've thought about it . - Well ? - I 'll go to college . - And then what ? Bend over for $ 500 dollars a month ? - Doc , I 'm not catching on . - Yes you are ! We 've got tons of guns . These criminal authorities are just bots to us . We demand from then 50 grand a month , that 's 10 grand each . Sounds sweet ? So you 're suggesting that we become gangsters ourselves ? Matvey and his gang should 've been out ages ago , but they 're living like kings . Life 's given us such a chance ! It 's a sin not to seize it . - But not like this . - Why not ? Then how ? Vampire , in Counter you 're # 1 , but in life you 're slow , it seems . Just think , how many more such disks are out there ? Tomorrow there 'll be hundreds like us . The whole world will turn into one Counter game . We are the best team , we must hurry to grab our share . Rita will not agree . Convince her . Dima , no , and no again . Rita , what 's there to fear ? We 'll take them all out like bots . - I know . It 's not about that . - What then ? Dima , listen . When I 'm driving a car , I see the road like on a computer screen , but I understand that I 'm driving on a real road . Don 't you understand that these are live people before you ? - They 're not people , they 're gangsters . - What 's the difference ? I don 't want . And I did not want my mom to die . But Matvey decided that at the furniture factory it was more advantageous to produce vodka . Dad was fired from his job . If only we had money then to pay for an operation in Moscow ... Rita , we are given such opportunities ! Give them up ? Not take advantage ? I 'm going anyways . And then , we do not plan to kill anyone . We will just show force and take what 's ours . That 's all . You promise ? I promise . You will need a driver . I 'm coming with you . During the recording of the game there was a systems error . Pokrovsky gave one disc to his son . The error was confirmed . But the young man discovered new abilities and began to drive like a pro . Pokrovsky gave all the discs to the winners of the tournament ... and hired Skolsky to follow them . Then he closed the company , loaded all the disks onto a truck and disappeared . - Contact information ! - I don 't know ! I really don 't know ! He always called me himself . Skolsky had his direct contact . I 'm waiting for answers ! You can grind down my teeth with a file , still I won 't say anything . You 'll have more fun that way . Cheap bastards . You purchased an airship , but didn 't have the money for scopolamine ? A joker ? You know , how I love jokers ? I cannot allow myself to be called cheap ... even for the pleasure of my associates . Finish off this matter . I 'm off to see the doctor . Fragile , that 's enough . Let the first one go , this one I 'll handle myself . What is your name ? Oleg Skolsky .

Base , how 's the weather ? Tier 4 , thunderstorm from the left . Understood . Can you imagine how much easier these disks would make the Viliermo operation ? No mercenaries , no transit for them . Bring these kids to me . I want to know more about them . They 're kids . Won 't they make trouble ? Don 't we have enough methods to get them to behave ? Doc , what if these gangsters don 't agree ? - If we press , they 'll give in . - And if they don 't give in ? Then we 'll make them . The weapons are going to get wet . Prepare the lasers . Dima , you promised . I remember . Your device . You 're going to talk , you don 't need a silencer . I 'll take care of the guards . Now give this kid a minute of your attention . Who are you trying to scare , you clowns ? I 'll make stand-up comedians out of you ! You 'll be the stand-up comedian . Better you pay us $ 50,000 per month of good money , then we won 't touch anyone . Since when do we have to pay you , you prematures ? For what ? Maybe because we are the strongest . How 's that option ? You 'll pay to keep your life . Whoever thinks their life is not worth that money can say goodbye to it right now . Better not make us angry . What 's your name , kid ? Doesn 't matter . Then listen here , wimp . It is easier to kill us , than to get something from us , so you can wallow in your anger as much as you want , idiots ! None of you even exist in this town anymore . You won 't get nothing , suckers ! The deceased do not need money . Don 't you understand that you are all already dead ? Vampire , why the delay ? They 'd have torn us to pieces . He 's a pacifist . Gave his word . - Shut your mouth ! - Are you coming ? - Long , how many you minused ? - Three . We 're even .

You 'll sign a confidentiality agreement and will be able to regularly see your relatives . - And if we refuse ? - I said that we use the most advanced technology . - Long , how many you minused ? - Three . - We 're even . Now I will show you the pilot 's cabin . Long corridor . - Doc , where are Vampire and Rita ? - Resting in a cabin . Fixation of the module is complete . - Charging valve is open . - Some place . The level . You know ... when I didn 't see you in the car I thought I 'll smash someone to pieces . - Dima . - What ? - What are you getting involved in ? - It 's cool here , right ? You 've gone mad . Rita , many countries of the world have special forces . Do you know , how we 'll be able to live ? Rita . Rita , what 's wrong ? Dima , how do you imagine our future life ?

Tomorrow we are meeting with a guest , to whom I want to show your abilities . Then we 'll return to the base . Today you can have fun . Please . In school I had an English teacher with these same glasses . She wanted to leave me for a second year . And I wanted to fuck on her desk . Put on the glasses and say : " Komarenko , are you ready for your lesson today ? " - For additional payment . - $ 500 rubles more .

Let 's go . - Are our friends coming ? - No , they have a different program ... museums , exhibitions ... Can you imagine that we 'll have this not for just one day ? We 'll have it . - Hello . How are you ? - Welcome . Keep up the tempo . Interval is 5 meters . One by one , march ! Heads low ! Work it ! Our training camp can prepare about 200 fighters per month . We plan to send them to Bolivia ... through Argentina and Brazil . To have control over Altiplano it 's enough for us to send you 1,500 mercenaries . Not all field commanders will resist . It 's enough to defeat El Toro and Alejandro . The rest will join me . The transfer of 1,500 fighters will take a long time . I can conquer province with my own Sendero Luminoso and 500 more soldiers of luck . Maybe , the transfer will not be needed at all . Mr. Mercado , I offer you to look at how 15 of the best fighters ... will deal with our special group . We 'll organize a Paintball Match - 5 against 15 . And who are the " Magnificent Five " ? - Send it further . - Here it is . What boys are these ? Boys , don 't forget to put masks on . - Put one on yourself . - It 'll look better on you . The task is to suppress the enemy with fire , hit him out of position and destroy him . Begin ! Mosquito , cover Long ! I 'm at point . - ... at left flank . - Got it . Third minused . Guys , 3 coming from the rear ! Leading last ones to the right . Beautiful . Yeah , they knocked you out of position quite well . Put on the mask ! - How many frags ? - 5 . - I got 4 . - How 4 ? Bearded one is mine . Oh , Mosquito , it got you . - No , it didn 't , just a side splash . - Mosquito , Mosquito , Mosquito . Bearded one is mine ! We both got him . This is simply amazing . How they move ! What synchronization ! Each of these guys is worth 10 soldiers , and together they are a single whole . Send me to Altiplano 100 of these guys ... and consider the palladium to be in your hands already . We will take the province into our control in a single day . Let 's leave palladium aside . Tell me , Viliermo ... in Bolivia are there a lot of computer clubs ? To find a couple hundred gamers is not a problem . - Bolivia is a poor country . - Printout from online news . For $ 100 dollars these guys will raid the presidential palace , - ... let alone the provinces . - I will transfer the money . " Sergei Zaritsyn concludes a major deal with the government of Bolivia . " " Terranko becomes the lead shareholder in the company ' New Energy ' to realize Palladium-2 . " Do we have enough time ? At 5 : 00 pm he will get done with a conference in Nizhniy Novgorod , then he 'll fly to La-Pas . An armored Mercedes , two jeeps with security guards . We have 4 hours . Miracles do not happen . And what did we see just now ? Sergey Victorovich Zaritsyn ... he started the construction of a nuclear graveyard on the territory of Nizhniy Novgorod . Lowest level of security . Tomorrow he will sign a contract and a Chernobyl will be built in your hometown . If that happens , the population death rate will increase 5 times . No other way of stopping him ? If we could , we wouldn 't ask for your help . We have only 3 hours in reserve . The chief jeep is equipped with an optical scanner . Any optics will be detected within a radius of a kilometer . Ideal position for a sniper is right here . A hotel closed for repairs . We take up position on the top floor , we 'll have bird 's eye view of company entrance . But the escort will stop exactly in front of the door , so there 's not enough time even for me to do this job without optics . The second unit will make them stop at a distance of 10 meters . We 'll make it look like an accident . Mosquito and Long will not be suspected . There is a danger that the security will calculate the firing point , so exit from the roof must be very fast ... - ... just in case someone will come with me . - Vampire , I 'm coming with you . No , Yan , sorry . If anything happens , you won 't make it . Doc will come with me . For getting away we 'll take special transportation . An ambulance will be best . - You don 't have a better driver than me . - No one has . Air waves will be scanned . For communication we take mobiles in conference mode . Everyone has weapons . In half an hour we land 10 km from the city . Good luck . - Don 't stand in the window . - When he comes out , I 'll step away . Journalists . He 's coming out now . Go . Rita , how are you ? I 'm at the spot . - Yan , what 's on the street ? - I see the escort . Start ! Long , how 's the water ? Ready ? It 's good . Rolling around . Long , I see you . Idiot ! - Yan - beautiful ! - Yeah . Did you see ? What happened ? - Don 't know . - Some guy on roller blades . - What happened ? - Hello . Please , forgive us . We were driving , then a roller guy jumped out , we nearly killed him . - Move aside . - It 's an accident . We 'll clean it all up ! Manager called us : " Be quick . " But then this guy on roller blades ... We almost killed him . We , students , get all the junk . We 'll clean it all up right away ! So . Quickly clean this up and clear the road . - All clear . - Dom , all clear . Daddy is not here , but he 'll be here soon . Don 't worry , he 's coming soon . - Sergey Victorovich ! - Two words ! Stand further , please . Move away . Okay , only one of you ... Masha , please . - Go . - Bullet will pass through , I 'll kill the journalist . Two frags with one shot . The coming deal with Bolivia ... is being called the biggest deal in history of overseas investments . Can you tell us the monetary amount of the contract ? Of course not . The sum will not be disclosed . I can only say that for our holding it is a record investment sum . It is known that the Altiplano , the region where palladium has been found , has been under the control of rebel forces hostile to the current government . Tell us , do you not think this enterprise to be too risky ? Yes , the province of Altiplano is not under control of government , - but the criminal forces are not eternal . - Long , stop ! Freeze . If we destroy the hated squads of Commander Viliermo Mercado , access to palladium will become open , and investment will be made ... only when Viliermo and others like him are destroyed . So on the question of risk : I would like this to be the most risky enterprise of my life . We will come to Altiplano to stay for long . Doc , we 've been cheated . - Unit 2 , Unit 3 , withdraw ! - Are you crazy ? Remember the Latin guy for whom we did that whole circus ? His name was Viliermo . Even if Don Pedro , he 's getting away ! They are not special forces ! Zaritsyn just wants their palladium . Bro , this is our job , we are being paid money for it , understand ? To murder a business competitor ? Palladium , Viliermo ... You 're right . Put away the rifle . - Excuse me , thank you . That 's all . - Big thanks ! Don 't scare me like that ! - Polina Sergeevna , why are you here ? - Mom allowed me . Unit 1 , Unit 3 , Vampire is minused . - What ? - Doc , what 's happening ? I 'm taking control . Mosquito , Long , go to escort . Block the door ! Hold the door ! Doc , what are you doing ? The job is done . Let 's run from here . - What do we do , Doc ? - Call the police ! Doc , so much blood ! Where is it coming from ? Press on it ! Press ! Idiots . Vampire . Run . Run , run , run ! Guys ... Doc ... I won 't make it . Leave me a gun ... Shut your mouth ! Come here . Ay ! It hurts , it hurts ! - Mosquito , talk to him ! - Long ! Long , how are you ? Stand back . Don 't close your eyes ! - Watch the perimeter ! - Don 't close your eyes ! - Quite set up , ha ? - Doc , only don 't turn me in ! - This is your fault ! - It is , it is . I 'm guilty , but I did get you all out . You will coordinate , I will just be in the group . I must stay , Doc , only don 't turn me in . What ever happened with you guys ? How did you sink ? Together we sunk , together we will get out . Yan ? - Yan , is this the end ? - I 'll go check . - Doc , what have you done ? - I striked out . Long ! Rita ! Doc , you destroyed the bus ? Did I have a choice ? Quickly ! Come on . Speed off ! Rita ? - Rita ! - I 'll drive . No , Boris Sergeevich , they 're not back yet . As soon as I see them , I 'll call you immediately . Long , hold on ! Lift . Higher , higher . Right here . Long , hold on . - Bitch , where 's all this blood from ? - A vein or artery torn ... Heck knows ! Vampire ! Find something ... A stick ... I don 't know . Some wrench ! Mosquito ... Here . Long , hold on . - We need to go to a hospital . - That 's where we 'll get caught . Rita is injured ! And he won 't make it ! - We go to meeting point . Lebedev will decide . - It 's stopping . Stopping . Long , the bleeding is stopping , do you hear ? I haven 't tightened it yet . Kostya ! Kostya , what 's with you ? Kostya ! Kostya ! We did everything . We need a doctor . Quickly into the van . - Leave him . - How 's that ? Quickly , I said ! - I 'm not leaving her . - Cool off .

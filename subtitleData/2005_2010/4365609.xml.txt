 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ... What is it you wanted to show me ? We need to learn how they work , how to fight ' em . We 're developing a human interactive AI . The name is " Babylon " . It 's going to change the World . - Dr. Boyd Sherman . - He 's on that wall for a reason . I guess I 'm still a little fuzzy as to why you called me here . - The AI needs to be trained . - You care about this girl ? - Then leave her alone . - You 're pissed off because I found someone I actually like spending time with and it 's not you . What does this mean to you ? I keep seeing it in my dreams , John . It means something . Go back to bed . Keep it ruining . We 'll be back . - Right place ? - Right place . Should have brought John . We dont need to know much about computers in order to do this . Get the ones over there . It 's the same as the rest . It 's vaporware . - There 's nothing there ? - I didn 't say that . It 's a design for an AI . Built to handle big problems . But you need a whole server farm , and they 've got zip ... less than zip ... after you lobotomized their desktops . But they have a design . But it 's like all those articles you read about terrorists having plans for bombs and they 're missing the plutonium . It 's another dead end . You 're chasing phantoms and smudges on a wall . Again . Artificial intelligence , the company logo , - the three dots ... - Are fingerprints ... left by that poor bastard while he was bleeding out , that 's all . It 's just blood . Everything on that wall has meant something . It 's all blood . Cromartie 's body isn 't in Ellison 's yard . Nobody 's saying to stop looking . But this ... its not the Turk . You 've been looking really hard , mom . - Maybe too hard . - If you 're gonna start in too , don 't . - Morning . - Good morning to you . Well , I did some digging on the drives . Dakara Systems is hunting for start-up money . They need investors for the server farm they 're gonna build . Big investors . I made you an appointment . Here 's your cover . I 'm a rich divorcee looking to put my money into tech start-ups . That 's right . I also made you a cheat sheet so you wouldn 't sound like a total moron when you 're asking about neural networks and emergent behavior . - I have no idea what you just said . - Yeah , that 's my point . Were you up all night doing this ? Dakara Systems is a start-up , okay . So was Cyberdyne once . Andy Goode was building a chess program . Barbara Chamberlain was trying to solve a traffic problem . It always starts small . You 've got 30 seconds . - Go . - Funny , Derek . 25 . I 'm not joking . - I was sent back to find him . - You could have told me . You could have told me you were living with him . With her . It . Metal . He wasn 't talking to anyone anymore . Just her . He 's making questionable decisions . Getting people killed . Good people . - 10 seconds . - She 's taken over . It 's sick is what it is . Imagine if he spends the next 20 years with her . Imagine what he 'd become . What she 'll turn him into . Just try . I 'm here to stop her . I 'm here to save him . I 've gotta think about this . What the hell are you doing here ? Why 'd Connor sent you back ? I love you ... but don 't push it . 210 : Strange Things Happen at the One Two Point Been a long time . Heard you lost some weight . Yeah , well , too much iron in your diet 's not good . What you got ? A heat wave blew a transformer on Sunday , blacked out half of downtown . Single guy , working the weekends . Spent eight hours in a sealed room . No AC , no ventilation . Heated up until it easy-baked him to death . Not a happy ending . His name is Dr. Boyd Sherman . He was a consultant on a project here . He worked downstairs . Downstairs ? The basement ? We call the project Babylon . It 's a sophisticated computer program . An artificial intelligence . During the blackout , the AI reserved generator power for itself . And in doing so , shut down the building 's other systems . And this AI ... it has control over the building ? You make it sound like a monster movie . The facility and the AI are interconnected only to the extent that the AI needs the facility 's resources to help it grow . And does growing ... involve allowing the agonizing death of an otherwise healthy man ? I don 't know what his intentions were . Intentions ? Now it does sound like a monster movie . Which is why we need to find out . - Thank you , Colonel . - Good to see you . Sarah Gale . Alex Akagi . Welcome to Dakara . You 'll have to bear with us . We had a break-in last night . They took our drives . Industrial espionage , for sure . There 's a lot of money in AI . A lot of money . Aren 't you worried they 've got your software now ? - That they 'll pass it off as their own ? - No . My son built security measures into the code . Anyone tries to use the system , it 'll attack . Is that why the AF wants it ? The Air Force has been interested in AI applications for a long time . As far back as the ' 80s . Strange you call the ' 80s " far back " . I know , isn 't it ? Are you a music fan ? That 's how I mark the decades . Fome , the ' 80s will always be Duran Duran . Duran Duran ... I loved Duran Duran . We used to go dancing . I miss dancing . - We 'd dress up . - Headband , big hair ? It 's the hardest thing to get right . - Hair . - Right . So ... the Air Force . Spreading money all over . RD , industry co-financing , prizes . I call her Emma . My AI . Her name is Emma . Like my mom . He never knew her . She died in a car crash in 1984 . Coffee ? Always helps me think better . - You ? - Always . Do you like chess ? I don 't pretend to know what goes on in that big brain . He operates in realms that you and I can 't imagine . He just has trouble with this one . He needs you . I bet sometimes it feels like he always will . You have any kids ? Just one . Just my son . Also challenging ? - In his own way . - Then , you get it . We 'd do anything for our kids , throw our lives out the window if we had to . Tell me what you need . Well , last night I would have said $ 100,000 and little patience . This morning I need ten times that and a miracle . That 's a hell of a morning . - Xander 's design is so good . - How much time do you have ? Two weeks . You need more than I have , Mr. Akagi . Call me Alex . Sorry , Alex . Well , I 'm sorry too , Ms. Gale . Call me Sarah . Hi , I 'm looking for Riley . Yeah , sure . You must be John . Kay . This is John . Come in . Riley 's upstairs . So your foster parents ... it 's not really what I imagined . Yeah , they 're nice . They 're too nice . They 're aliens . You see those kids down there ? They 're not theirs . They 're just losers ... and cast-offs and rejects . They run a loser camp here . What about my posters ? What 's your favorite ? I don 't know . I like Yosemite . I 've been there with my mom . What about you ? I 'm gonna guess the bear . You seem like a bear person . It 's not a poster of a bear . It 's a poster of a fish being caught by a bear . Just swiped out of the water . Totally at random . Do the other fish even care ? Do they even notice ? They just keep swimming , like nothing happened . Because nothing important did . I think I 'm gonna go . Stay . I mean , you came here for a reason , right ? Stay . Back in Mexico , I promised to explain everything . The truth . But the truth is ... there 's nothing I can explain . Nothing I can say . You don 't have to say anything . It 's okay . You can just sit here with me . I 'd like that . Sorry . Okay , we 've got three dots , an AI with a name , and a strong sense of self-preservation . Plus the United States Air Force . What does this add up to for you ? Not the Turk . Xander doesn 't play chess . He prefers " Go . " It 's a game . The chinese invented it 5,000 years ago . Xander said it 's been calculated there are more possible " Go " games than there are atoms in the universe . He 's offered to teach me how to play . Did he offer to tell you about his AI ? It 's not the Turk . I told you , Xander doesn 't play chess . But it could be a piece of the puzzle . We 've seen that . Strange things happen at the one-two point . It 's a Go proverb . It means the usual rules don 't always apply . It 's always the same rules . They always apply . Dakara has no money . They 'll miss the Air Force 's deadline . They 'll find the money . Everything they need . Every penny . - They 'll get their miracle . - How do you know ? I know because it 's written in blood on my basement wall . Cute top . You wanted to talk ? You look tired . Are you sleeping enough ? He came to visit me today . And I though he was gonna tell me everything . I think that 's what he wanted to do . And then ... nothing happened . He just left . Something 's wrong . - Off balance . - Steady him . He 's reaching out . He ran away from me . He 's a boy . There 's a lot of mirrors in this world . Did you notice that ? I don 't think I can do this anymore . I 'm sorry . It 's not easy , I understand . Maybe you even have some real feelings for him . Who wouldn 't ? He 's John Connor . There 's a reason people follow him all over hell . Well , what if I want out ? How would you do that ? Where would you go ? There is no out . You can do this . You have to do this . Take a look at this . You see ' em ? The three dots on the belt . If you 're gonna talk about my mom when she 's not here ... No , I 'm talking about the three dots on this belt . I 'm seeing them everywhere now . It 's got me thinking how crazy this can make you . You start seeing things in every corner and on every wall . And pretty soon you forget what it was you were looking for in the first place . All of us , everyone . I remember . I always remember . Do you ? Are you sure ? Derek , what the hell ? Nothing . I just need to know that you 're seeing clearly . I need to know someone is , but especially you . How old did you say your son was ? I didn 't , but he 's 16 . Guess we had our kids at about the same age . I had mine when I was 21 . You ? - 19 . - 19 . My wife , Emma , was 19 when we first met . It was the debut performance of Pink Floyd 's The Wall at the LA Memorial Sports Arena . I remember that . I wanted to see it so bad . That was in 1980 , so you were ... nine ? I was very young . This morning I told you I needed a miracle . Did you get it ? Do you remember the chess tournament the Air Force sponsored a couple of months ago ? A friend of a friend works for a company that sponsored the winners ... the Japanese . They have a chip , a prototype . 12 nanometers . A chip ? It 's a supercomputer , small enough to fit on the end of your finger . They want to license it to us . We quietly put it through its paces , they get a real-world test . And if it works , we 're all geniuses . Very rich geniuses . What do you need for this chip ? A deposit . Our Japanese friends are very risk-averse . They want half a million to demonstrate seriousness . And you think it works , this chip ? It 's the future . I 've been in warmer morgues . We 've gotta keep the temperature around freezing or the towers would fry . A computer 's like anything else . More you ask , more power it needs . Power generates heat , requires cooling , needs more power . You know , Babylon is kind of a pig . Babylon ? You know the story ? I was a comp science major . I minored in beer bong engineering . I didn 't read a lot of stories . It was a marvel . God destroyed it . God definitely gave it a shot yesterday . The blackout should have shut it down . Should 've ? Babylon routed every watt from the generators to keep itself running . - So it broke the rules . - It invented new ones . Ms. Weaver said Dr. Sherman worked on the AI . Touchy-feely BS , if you ask me . How did it feel about him ? Sorry ? Babylon . How did it feel about Dr. Sherman ? I know how that sounds . It 's a computer . I mean , how does a coffee maker feel about coffee ? Humor me . You 're asking if it knew it was killing Sherman when it threw the switch ? Impossible . I hope . It 's not enough . What would be enough ? Everything . Everything , then . You 're certain ? Certain is a luxury . The rules do not apply . No , I guess they don 't . - Are you okay ? - Just impatient . Sorry for the big prologue . You have to use the full range of tools on a guy like him before you can close . You 're lucky your tech there aren 't his type . You 're kidding . A little bit . Are you sure you want to do this in cash ? I don 't like banks . Return the toast . Proper etiquette . They used to think that 12 nanometer scale was impossible . The circuits are so tiny , you 're all but in the quantum realm . It 's the most sophisticated processor on Earth . If you could take your memories , your consciousness ... everything that makes you a person ... turn it into pure data and download it onto a machine , that chip could run it . Are you gonna eat that ? America , I love it here . No pressure . No expectations . Good sake . So , Hideo , How long do you estimate before we stop screwing around here , and you hand over the chip ? A pleasure doing business with you , Ms. Gale . I didn 't know you spoke Japanese . I was into Styx before Duran Duran . You missed dinner again . Leftovers are in the fridge . All right , give it back . - Give what back ? - The remote . You took it , and I know you did . Riley saw . - I did not , you liar . - I 'm gonna tell Mom . Tell mom what ? Gina took the remote because she knows that shark week is on , and she wants to watch some pillow-biters sing and dance . I know you 're upset , but we don 't use those words in this house . But she started it , and Riley saw . - He 's crazy . - What ? I said ... he 's crazy . You 're all crazy ! Every one of you . You just sit here in your cozy little house with your cold sodas and your Facebook pages like it all matters . Like it 's even real . But it 's not . It 's all gonna burn , and you 're gonna be nothing but bleached skulls . Don 't you get it ? You 're dead . All of you are dead ! Honey , don 't ... I 'm sorry . Thank you . Look at them . So many dreams . We 're about to burn those dreams to the ground . Connections are up . Going full power . Loading the program . - What 's going on ? - Core dump . Processor register error in the CPU memory . I 'm sure it 's just a hiccup . The data ... should have been like a postage stamp on a pool table . But it 's trying to push a watermelon through a garden hose . It 's 40 nanometers , not 12 . This chip is an older design . Disguised to appear more advanced . Minamoto screwed us . My family used to run a dry-goods store in Azusa before the second World War . After Pearl Harbor , when they were all getting rounded up for internment at heart mountain , the neighbors offered to watch our home and business for us . " Just sign this little piece of paper , Mr. Agagi . " What my grandpa didn 't know is that while his son was fighting his way across Italy with the 442nd , the neighbors were getting the property condemned and deeding it to themselves . You couldn 't have known about Minamoto . I 'll fix it . I 'm gonna make it right . I don 't know how long it 'll take , but I 'll pay you back , every dime . That 's not important right now . I 'll talk to him . You don 't just talk to someone like him . Minamoto is old country . Yakuza . - You know what Yakuza is ? - Yakuza . A gangster . You hit him , he 'll hit you back . Only he 'll hit you back tenfold . He 'll mail what 's left of you to your son one piece at a time , COD . And you trusted him . Most of these guys are mobbed up . You didn 't buy that chip . You were paying him to steal it . All we know are the facts . Means . Opportunity . But intent ? Not even Mr. Murch can guess . Well , why did you ask him ? Ask the Babylon AI . Ask John Henry . It has a name ? That was something Dr. Sherman did . Gave it that name . It 's not a person . But it 's a mind . Talk to John Henry . The AI communicates through images . Symbolistic responses . We thought about using a natural language interface but decided against it . Too creepy . But it has voice recognition . Just talk to it . John Henry , I 'm James Ellison . You know who I am . Good . Do you know Dr. Boyd Sherman ? It 's a yes . Binary . One is yes , zero is no . Did you work with him yesterday ? Did you work with him today ? Why is that ? Null operator . No operation . Could mean dead . Could mean waiting for input . Just rephrase it . Show me what happened to Dr. Sherman . He was in the lab when the power went out . Biometrics showed normal . Generators came online . Power went to the server farms . Dr. Sherman tried to leave . The electronic door failed . His pulse increased . There was only enough power to run and cool the servers . Security and biometric monitoring went offline . Show me security video and biometrics for the lab at the time external power returned . His heart had stopped . His temperature had risen with the room to almost double standard ambient temperatures . Well above human survivability levels . He was dead . But John Henry says " Medical Attention Required " . Was Dr. Sherman alive at this time ? But you called the paramedics . You thought they could help ? Am I alive ? Am I dead ? Null operator . Doesn 't understand the question . How 'd you feel about Dr. Sherman ? Do you understand that redirecting the power to the server farms caused Dr. Sherman to die ? What image do you associate with that information ? What image do you associate with that information ? It has no feeling for what it did . Has no opinion . That 's what it 's telling you . Sure , you taught it procedures . You taught it rules , but it 's got no ethics . No morals . Whether ... it had any feeling about Dr. Sherman shouldn 't matter if you had taught it to value Sherman 's life . Someone killed a man . And it wasn 't John Henry . Excuse me . What would you teach it ? What would you teach it , if you could ? If you want to teach it commands , start with the first Ten . Get down on the ground now ! Get down on the ground ! Now ! - I don 't have your money . - Your english got good . Real good . Are you gonna kill me ? If I were you , I 'd try and talk me out of it . What do you want me to say ? I 'm an actor . I 'll say whatever you want . I 'm just an actor . An actor ? Who hired you ? The real Minamoto or Yakuza ? The real ... Lady , I told you . I want the chip . The real chip . I just handed back what was handed to me by Akagi . That 's all , I swear . - Don 't lie ! - Please ! - What ? - He 's not lying . - And how the hell do you know ? - I know . You never saw my face . Did you get it ? Something 's going on here . We just have to dig deeper . The guy 's an actor . You know who hired him , and why . - Is someone gonna fill me in ? - It all adds up . The dots , the AI , the Air Force , the chip . The nothing . Listen to yourself . First it 's the dots , then the AI . Now it 's the chip . Whatever you 've needed it to be , that 's what it is . You got played . It happens . Welcome to the human race . - Who you working for ? - Sarah , what ... - You heard me ! - What do you mean ? Don 't lie to me . Sarah , I 'm not working for anybody . It 's just me and Xander . Spent a couple of years in a nut house . You wanna know why ? Men like you . Time was I 'd have blown this building sky-high , - so don 't lie to me ! - I 'm sorry , okay ? I 'm sorry ! - What are you sorry for ? - The money . I 'm sorry about the money . It 's not about the damn money ! Where 's Xander ? Tell me about the chip , about the AI , about the three dots . Please don 't hurt my boy . Please . Stop changing the subject and making this about your wife , your poor grandpa , your son . Please , it is . It 's all about him . It 's all about Xander . - Three dots . - It 's just a logo , you crazy bitch ! You wanna see Xander ? - Come on . Please . - You wanna see your son ? Please don 't hurt him . I 'll kill you . Tell him . Tell him what you won 't tell me . Tell him the truth . Dad ... It 's okay . I won 't let her hurt you . Then tell your son what you 've done , or she 'll throw you through that window . Don 't think she can 't . There was no chip . I made it up to get her money . What ? No chip . I mocked it up and hired Minamoto to sell it to us . We couldn 't make the Air Force deadline , Xan . No chance . I had to make sure you were taken care of . I just couldn 't take that chance . But it could work . My design can work . - Daddy ... - I hope you 're right . I do . I have faith in you . It 's just ... sometimes I barely understand what you 're saying . And I wonder if you understand me . The money is under my desk . And it 's just a logo . I 'm gonna regret giving you a key . Aren 't I ? John Connor 's my nephew . Three people know that fact . You 're the fourth . I see . I came here to fight a war . To do whatever it takes to stop Skynet . Now . Today . If we 're gonna do this , there 's no more room for secrets . If there 's anything you haven 't told me , I need to hear it now . Remember when we were stationed at Serrano Point ? That whole time ... I was using your toothbrush . The one in my mess kit ? I wasn 't using it to brush my teeth . Mom ? It 's Riley . I 'm okay . Knocking . How not like you . Sarcasm . How not like you . Wait , that 's exactly like you . I just wanted to stop by to let you know that I reject your rejection . Do you want to go for a walk ? Mom , I 'm going out for a while . I thought about what you said . About rules . The Ten Commandments . I 'm not qualified to teach John Henry those things . I don 't know how . That 's why Dr. Sherman was here . I want to show you something . In folklore , John Henry raced a steam drill through a mountain . One man alone challenged the machine , armed with an iron hammer . They say he was born with it in his hand . His heart gave out . He died , I know . John Henry defeated the machine . But he couldn 't stop progress . Hello , Mr. Ellison . My name is John Henry . How are you today ?

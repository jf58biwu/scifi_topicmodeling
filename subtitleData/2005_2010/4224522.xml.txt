What about Grandpa ? - Alvar ? He had taken away their lives in their hands through . Along the road to the tree . Your father cut the rope . Not a mention . But the boy knew how to preach . You can be proud of . He scared the whole village a healthy fear of God . He described the last sentence . What God is betrayed . And what salary to expect . " If you can keep your fingers seconds boiling water , " he said - " So how does it feel to be in a boiling a cauldron of eternity ? " Yes , it made an impression . But the bully hated it . Hated . Therefore , the tempter sent airueen . She sent him . Yes , even your father was carnal man . He was a vile woman . Pruning , filthy little whore . And he did . Time after time . I asked him to fight . And Christ won . But eventually ... Dirty tyngästä spread evil and evil got the upper hand . How it screamed at him . He shouted . The last day of his walking in the hillside as the foaming stallion . Then I saw my son for the last time , the way it creates a harlot . I believe that my father was murdered . I believe that it was Lidman father . No . No . Lidman father is a proper man . But they have a child . He 's not a good kid . I guess you knew it . He is corrupt , terrible , malevolent child . The child , who killed your father . No . Henrik . Come on , Henry ! Come on ! Mom will show you , you know ! Mother looks for you ! What did you do in the barn ? Nothing . - What did you do in the barn ? I do not do anything . You have to believe me . My father . Ivar ... How do I hate the man . I hate . Carnal fathers do not have anything .

" " The worms in them , will never die nor was ever shut down . " The Church of Sweden has since 1983 - denied the existence of hell . - They are cowards . Weak and faithless . Shameful ... Murderers . Their place is in the lake which burns sulfur and fire . " They piinattakoon forever . " Revelation . 1983 ... Can you feel it ? Bronze gates have been opened . Always covered up to the ninth . Open your eyes and see . Grab your sword , which God has put in front of you . Psalm 21 " Your right hand to reach all enemies , O Lord . " " You get attached to your opponent . " " You are putting them as a burning fiery furnace " - " When they are in front of you , Lord . " " You dispose of them in anger and came to destroy them .

They take you as your father took . Do you not see ? The doctor is entitled to the same hunting crowd . He killed your father , and a forensic pathologist concealed it ! Run ! Olle ! Now is the time to reap some of the what some have sown . Tonight , when the lamp in the barn lights ... He comes now ! Fire ! Kipunoivan with the sword of the Lord ! Please help ... Please help . Are you so weak that you let her a mocking laugh ? That you let him kill your father and then laugh derisively ? I do not . Make him a message . Message ? What are the benefits do you think it is ? So that justice may prevail , you must take destiny into your own hands . It is now time to do it , why you came here . Time to take revenge on your father 's behalf . I 'll show you the road . I 'll give you the tool . I 'm so tired . Rests . When you wake up , get up in a new guise . Okay . Nora . Olle ... Where have you been ? Sit down . Who lit the barn lights ? Who lit the barn lights ? Who lit the barn lights ? Olle , who lit the barn lights ? I will read you the first psalm . Psalm , by her father reading each of worship . Remember it , yes . Psalm from the truth lies . God 's enemies . It will tell you . It is Psalm 21 - The priest is not ... Calling Lars-Erik . It 's too late ! The pastor has asked the three days , Make calls to him , but you refused . You know that he is lying ! If the servants of God to deprive life , has made a mortal sin . You know it and you will get punished , now and forever . Olle ... Psalm 21 reads as follows : " The right hand reaches the enemy . " - It was you . " You are putting them than was seen furnace of fire ... " You sytytit lights . " ... When they are in front of you , sir . " You have to know something . You do not know it . " You dispose of them in anger and came to destroy them . " You need to know about it ! - " The fire will destroy them ! " " Their children do you dispose of face of the earth ...

" " You are putting them than was seen furnace of fire , when they are in front of you . " " You dispose of them in anger ... " Amen . And it continued after the wedding . It continued after the wedding ... He was a vile woman . Pruning . Dirty , dirty , little whore . He 's lying . It is a lie . Beats , beats , beats ! - Oh , Olle . Gabriel is your father . It is strange ... Remarkable . I 've always dreamed that it should be so . That makes everything much easier ! It was my fault ! There is a child . It is not good child . You must have known it . Damaged , terrible , malevolent child . I did it . - A child who killed his father . It was my fault . You and Dad were in the woods . Mom cut my hair . Then ... Then came ... He spoke with the mother . They spoke very well . Then ... Horneus ... He ... His hands ... His hands ... And the mother ... He saw the ... And her mother spoke to ... And the mother showed ... Horneus bent over ... And the mother ... Mother ... Mother ... Drowning Olle ! Ivar ! Olle ! I said nothing . Father . I said nothing . But you told , Henrik . You told . No , I am told . May not tell you , Henry . You knew that . It was a little secret . Little , little secret . Mom did not know it . It was our secret . Us . But I is not told anything . - Henrik , he became aware of it . Confess now , Henry . It is the best . Henry , you know what happens when you tell us ? Henrik , I 'm told it to you many times . If you said , not punishment . Severe punishment . A very long time . A very long time . Forgive me ! Dad ... Forgive me ! It is too late . Henrik , that does not help that you 're pulpit - and you claim that the punishment is a lie . Sword of truth you can not deny . Lies reveal you . Day of Judgement you can not avoid adding to play . When God shows you face of anger - It is clear to you god how terrible he is . I can not believe in God , which is less compassionate than I am . Little Henry , you just pahennat drive . You have to throw down . Black pohjattomuuteen , from anyone of no return . The sea , which returns fire and sulfur . Down ... hell . Oh , God ! Oh , God ! He can not help you now . In front of you is just another force . You will face your own self . Son . Fine , fine , son . It 's here . We found you last night kitchen floor . Father carried you upstairs . How are you ? So ... Lars-Erik Niskala . Hammer Dali coroner . The vicar is encountered in church . - Yeah . Ajnalla is relevant . " It will lead your way through life , " he said . We usually had to sit here ... browsing . Your father would have preferred that someone who believes that , should it . So , after all , that in spite of everything written some good things . Today 's sermon topic could possibly be Unorthodox . Maybe . The past week has been ... The past week has been a strange time ... me . But I 'll sleep much better now . Better than a long time . I see another kind of dreams . Good dreams . I see the dream of a world where there is no shame and guilt . Don 't Judge so you will not be judged . So , once said carpenter 's son Nazareth . But what religions do ? What do churches do ? Religions are in my opinion there is only one reason . For the oppression of the people . Serving in obedience classes pelottelemista purposes . So they do not dare to challenge elite privileges . And the elite , ladies and gentlemen , you have it . You have never instilled sin and shame . Elite , which has always been here church , not the rural church - 've never had to listen to rikinkatkuisia sermons . What 's he saying ? In the late 1800s , when , for example , Viktor Rydberg wanted out of the devil 's church Archbishop Sundberg said yes , yes . " But nize is always be in hell . " " Nize is always be in hell . " Is falling , he kidding ? - The rulers define morality . The holy name of God . But no one has a monopoly on God ! I said last week that hell no . I was wrong . I was wrong . Hell exists . I know it now . Yes , hell exists . Religions . Before the religions had not been hell . Religions invented hell ! Now he gets enough to control himself . - Don ' Judge - so you will not be judged ! Then said the son of man . But , however , the Church has done it 1700 years ! 1700 years ... - What 's he talking about ? ... Torture , summary executions , crusades - blood , fire , violence and injustices towards people ! John writes that it is , which no love , no nothing . It 's the law ! It is the answer ! Now , you restrain yourself ! - No . Silence serves the power ! The only way to defend himself with silence is to tell the truth . The truth set you free ! Truth and love ! Unlimited , unconditional love ! It is the only God I have left ! Get away from there ! Get away from there ! Not all of them agree with me but it is a good God ! Out ! Out of the house of God . Bless the Lord in heaven . Bless him for his high altitudes . Bless him , his angels . Bless him and his troops . Bless him , sun and moon . Bless him , all the great stars . Bless him , thou heaven , sky - you water the sky above ... Bless his name because he commanded , and they were created . He gave them in their place eternity . Decided to order , that will never disappear . You have to be the day , your day is night . God is a river full of water . You take the country , let it rain , you make it fertile and rich . For the seed to grow , you irrigate arable land corrugations . Wherever you go , grow rich harvest . Pastures of the wilderness are green . The hills wear a joy . Flocks of sheep decorate the angels . Valleys are covered with grain . All is joy and singing . All is joy and singing .

Last time we did that , you made us look like apeshit . The whole town thought we gone retard , you asshole ! My own fuckin ' father thought I killed my brother and buried him out in the woods . I thought it would be better . Better ? Better ? Fucking over your friends was better ? Telling the whole world we were lying ? Telling everybody we made everything up ? Guys ?

If it 's calling its buds , why aren 't we knee deep in these sons of bitches ? It must be damaged . Probably because of that goddamn ass whooping ... we put on this motherfucker out in them woods . Probably . Best not to take no chances . How 'd you know , Wyatt ? About the implant ? Call it a hunch . Keep the lights out and stay quiet and they might not find us . Take it back to Nixon 's farm in the morning . Safer to travel in the daytime . Hey , do you think we all got one of those ... GPS clicker thingies in us ? Wyatt would know if we did . Hey , that clicker went off the second it saw you . What the fuck is going on , man ? Wyatt ? You think you can check me for one them clickers ?

Not until morning . Hope , I 'm trying to protect you . By holding me hostage . First thing in the morning , I 'll take you anywhere you want to go . I 'm on fucking parole . Fuck off , Cody . You fuck off , Wyatt . I ain 't going back to prison ... ' cause this crazy ass bitch is losing it . You understand that ? This bitch called the cops , I swear to God I 'll cut her up . Hey , baby . What 's the play now ? You always got the answers . Put the gun down , Cody . You always thought you were the leader . Some leader . Look at us . We 're all fucked up now . I guess Timmy was the lucky one , huh ? Lucky my ass . You got no idea what happened to Timmy . That 's right , I have no idea . But you do . Look , we 're all friends here , okay ? Let 's not do anything stupid . Let 's take a deep breath and calm down . Hope ! What are you doing , baby ? Give me that knife , Hope . She looked it in the eyes , didn 't she ? Ah , fuck . Easy . This ain 't gonna fly , Wyatt . The thing 's got her . Don 't matter . She ain 't got nothing to do with this ! If that thing gets loose ... We 're all dead . I know she 's your girl and all ... But I don 't give a shit . No . It 's playing with us . Look what she 's doing ! I 'm shooting . No . No . No . Cody . Hope ... Hope . Please , baby ... This man will kill you . She 's fucking cutting it . Please , baby ... Concentrate on my voice . What do you want ? He 's talking to it . You let her go ! The gun . Put down the gun , Cody . No fuckin ' way . Calm down , Cody . Put down the fucking gun ! Fuck this bullshit ! Jesus Christ ! Put down the gun ! No fuckin ' way . Stop ! Let go of her ! Let go ! God damn it ! Let go ! Red line 's out of bounds . Nobody crosses it . No matter what . Oh , damn , that looks infected . Might need a tetanus shot . Had one when I was seven , remember ? Fuck itps deep . Oh , jees ... Wyatt . That works ? Hell if I know . You shouldnpt be out trying to pull some cockamamie stunt , Duke . You got a wife and kid . Pam left me four years ago . That ain 't shit . I 've seen worse . How many nights have you boys been out trying to catch one of those things ? Nights ? Try years . Probably seven by now . Damn , Duke . That 's some shit . It was either that or go out drinking . Well , there was some drinking out there too . Actually after a while it was pretty much all about the drinking . Got easier when Otis started hanging out . We could watch in shifts . Then numbnuts got out of prison . Fucking bear traps was his idea . Yeah , I could have guessed that . Going out to Nixon 's farm was our way of coping . You been coping , Wyatt ? What do you think , Duke ? Ah , shit ! Motherfucker ! Fuck ! Fuck it . God damn it . Ma 'am , I 'm sorry . I 'm supposed to put this duct tape over your mouth because of the ... Wyatt thought it 'd be better . You tell Wyatt to go fuck himself . We all know how it feels . Having one of those things inside you like that . Controlling you ? It 's the worst fucking thing ever . It 's hell . It 's worse when it 's longer . They did it to us for days . Oh , well . Let 's hold off on tape for now ... God damn it . What the fuck ? God damn it . Oh , fuck me . God damn it . What the fuck ? What the fuck are those ... God damn it . Oh , fuck ! Oh , God damn it . Oh , fuck . Please no . What the fuck . Fuck . God damn it Fuck ! Fuck . Oh , shit . Come on , man . I gotta drop a deuce . Quit playing . Is this why you gave me so much shit when I wanted to move in ? Yeah . Good call . Honey ... I never wanted to get you mixed up in all of this . You understand that , right ? You 're gonna have to give me a little more time on the understanding ' part . Get the hell out of my way ! Get the fuck out of my way ! Come on , Cody . Calm down , man . This was your fucking plan . No , my plan was to catch it . And now what ? You want out ? Oh , you sad fucking sack . There 's more at stake now than just us . You 're damned right . They killed my brother . Now get the fuck out of my way , Duke . Cody ! Cody , put that thing down . You 're not calling the fucking shots , Wyatt . Now I 'm not playing around here . I 've got business with this thing . And I plan on taking care of it right fucking now . Get out of my fucking way , Duke ! Cody ! Get the fuck out of my way , Duke ! Fucking savages . Calm down , Cody . I want answers , motherfuckers . Now ! Cody , this is some dangerous shit . Dangerous ? You want to see dangerous ? You boys still think I 'm screwing around ? It bit me . Look at that . It is spreading . We can help you . Duke . Not too close . What ? Listen , Cody , why don 't you turn off the torch and lay down man . You seen it before . It 's bad , ain 't it . Ain 't it ! It 's just a rash , right , Wyatt ? It 's just a rash , Cody . Oh , shit ! Get out of the fucking way ! This is between me and it . Put the torch down , okay ? We can fix this . We can get you to a hospital . Yeah . Yeah . I could be some college boy 's thesis project . I 'm not being a lab rat . Not again . That ain 't gonna happen , Cody . Now just put the torch down . Now see , Wyatt ? That 's your problem . You always think you got a say in the matter . You see what happens when you try to fuck with me ? Come on . You see what happens , motherfuckers ? I dare you . Come on . Try that shit again , you motherfuckers . You little pussies . Duke ! Don 't touch him . What about you , man ? Don 't worry about me . He 's not dead , is he ? I mean , I didn 't hit him that hard . No , he ain 't dead . Don 't worry . We just gonna let him rot away in there ? He needs help , Wyatt . Nobody can help him , all right ? Stay away from him . That shit 's contagious . But you touched him . It won 't do nothing . None of this shit ever does . That 's what Timmy had , isn 't it ? When they took us . That 's what killed Timmy . It won 't take long . They 'll start eating him inside and out . He 'll watch his flesh peel away layer by layer . It 'll hurt so bad , it 'll make him insane . Dangerous . A few hours from now , he 'll be begging us to put a bullet in his head ' cause his fingers are hurt so bad ... he won 't be able to pull the trigger . Sweet Jesus Christ on the cross . Wyatt . Can I talk with you for a minute alone ? Hey , what about me ? You stay in there and watch the girl . Shit , Duke , I don 't want to be alone with that chick . She freaks me out . Sorry , Wyatt . Just get your ass in there , Otis , please . Please . They let us catch it , didn 't they ? What the fuck you talking about , Duke ? I 'm saying there 's no way in Hades we could have caught that thing the way that we did . They just dropped that fucker off and sent him right to us . You 're crazy . I 'm sorry , Wyatt . I 'm sorry . I 'm such a fucking idiot . They knew our dumb asses would bring it to you . What the fuck would they want with me ? I don 't know . Maybe they ain 't done fucking with you yet . Have you ever wondered why you were up there the longest and ... came back with that clicker shit inside you ? I try not to think about that . I think it 's about time you started giving that some thought . Fuck me . Oh , shit . Oh , fuck . What 's going on ? Nothing , buddy . I wish you weren 't lying . Otis , you keep this door locked , ... and don 't let anything through . It 's loose , ain 't it . Just do as he says and secure the door . Maybe it 's gone . Oh , fuck . God damn it , Duke . It was over here . There 's fucking blood all over the place . Where the hell is it ? Help ! Wyatt , it 's Sheriff Henderson . Open up or I 'm breaking in . Get the fuck away from me . Just a minute . Hands up . Easy , Sheriff . What 's with the lights ? The power went out . Happens out here all the time . Oh , yeah ? Well , I heard voices . It 's the radio . I was hoping they 'd say when the electricity would be back . What 's this all about , Sheriff ? 91 1 call . Said you were holding a hostage . Is that right ? Yeah . An extraterrestrial one . What is it ? The third time this winter ? The fourth , I think . What , are you locking me in here ? No , it 's wild dogs , man . ... snooping around lately . I guess I could take care of some wild dogs . I guess you 're getting used to this prankster shit . Yeah . Anyways , we gotta check it all out . You know , the routine . Especially since the call came from your phone . My phone . Yeah . You been drinking ? Yeah , I had a couple . You mind if I have one ? I guess not . Good . What 's back there ? Uh , nothing . You got a key ? Yeah , I got it right here . Shit . I stepped in something . What is this ? A radiator leak ? Yeah , I guess so . Listen , Sheriff , there 's something I need to tell you . I got a girl in there . You got an alien groupie , huh ? No , she 's just a friend . I 'd like to meet this friend . What the fuck ! What- - Go away . Wyatt ! Wyatt ! Help me ! Shit ! Hold it . On the ground . I gotta ram it . I said hold it ! You 're gonna have to shoot me , Sheriff . Wyatt , help ! Wyatt ! Fuck ! On the ground ! Come on , Sheriff ! God damn it ! Please , Sheriff ! The next one 's gonna be between your ears . Otis ? Don 't move ! Don 't move ! Please , Wyatt , don 't move . It 's come here , Wyatt . I want my mommy . I want my mommy . I want my mommy . What the fuck . Don 't move . No . No . Don 't point the gun at it . Point it away , god damn it . Point it away ! Everybody stay calm . Stay calm . Stay calm . Get the tape , Duke ! Make it stop ! Make it stop ! Hold on , Duke . You fucker ! Take it ! Make it stop . Make it stop . You 're all right . You 're all right . I don 't think the duct tape 's gonna work this time . Wyatt ? You 're gonna be fine . You 're gonna be fine . Just hold it together , all right ? It 's all over . Sheriff ? Sheriff ? Sheriff ? Shit ... .. There 's a pulse . All right . I 'm gonna get you some help . Okay , Sheriff ? Fuck that . Go get me a beer . All right . Easy . How 's your friend ? About as good as you . All that shit about you and aliens was true , huh . Yeah . Shit . That 's fucked up . Got anything harder ? Yeah . Yeah . It 's not safe out here . It 's safe in there ? I 'm not going back in here , Wyatt . Not until it 's dead . We 're taking it back where they found it . Otis needs help . We 're gonna take him to County . Kill it , Wyatt . You can 't kill it , Hope . I ' ll do it , then . Hope . Hope ? Hope . Please don 't tell me it 'll be okay , Wyatt . If you tell me it 's gonna be okay , I swear to God , I 'll fuckin ' hurt you . Killing this thing will only make it worse . Worse ? Fucking worse ? Did you fucking see what it did ? Why can 't you be a man ? Why don 't you care ? I hate you ! I care . I care . Oh fuck . You had the keys . You should have just gotten the hell out of here . I 've never been so good with " should 've " . Me either . Me either . We 're losing him . Cody . Cody . Otis is ... Otis is bad off . We 're gonna go for help , man . Always thought one day we 'd find Timmy . Take him back to town and have a fucking parade or some shit . That ain 't gonna happen , huh , Wyatt . I 'm gonna die with everyone thinking I killed my brother . Nobody thinks you killed Timmy , man . The hell they don 't ! My own pop ... If I had my way ... I 'd take that fucking monster and drive it back to my pop 's little peach house , ... walk right past that motherfuckin white picket fence , ... and drop that piece of shit alien right on that cocksucker 's doorstep . Ding dong . Oh , that will be good . I 'm sorry , Cody . My mom ... she thinks I ' m working overtime . She 's gonna be all alone , now . Oh shit . Watch your fingers . Yep . Ready ? All right . It 's a heavy little fucker , isn 't it . I doubled the chains . Let 's hope it stays unconscious . Yeah . It ain 't safe out here , Duke . I can 't leave Cody . The boy 's my responsibility . Take care of yourself . Bye , buddy . What happens if we kill it , Wyatt ? You know what happens when an animal kills a human ? We kill that thing and they put us down . They put us all down . We kill one ... They declare war on the human race ? Wouldn 't be no war . They want us gone from this planet , we are gone . The show is over , end of the human race . It 'd be a goddamned massacre . Wyatt , when this is over , I think I 'll move back to my mama 's house . Cody ? I 'm real sorry , Cody . I 'm gonna make things right . Why 'd they come back , Wyatt ? They let the others go after the second night . They tested us all , you know . But Timmy and I ... I guess we made it past the first round . Timmy got sick real fast ... Like his brother . But it didn 't take with me . So they kept doing more and more . They kept fucking with me . They altered me . Till one morning I woke up , ... naked couple of counties away . They 'd sent me back with some sort of tracking device in my body . But I knew it was there because I could hear it clicking away . So I cut it out and went into hiding . I guess they want me back . They 're scared of you , Wyatt . When that thing was fucking around inside my head , I felt it . That 's why they came back for you . They 're scared shitless of you . Yeah , well the feeling 's mutual . What ? What the fuck , Wyatt ? Shut up ! Shut up ! They 'll hear . How do you even know- - I can feel them . Where are they ? Everywhere . Lots of them . We can 't just sit here . It 's not safe out there ! I 'm real sorry , sweetie ... Sure as fuck ain 't safer sitting in the middle of the road in this van with that thing in the back . Wyatt ? Wyatt ! Hope . Hope . This ain 't cool , Hope . Hope , this ain 't cool . That van 'll be our coffin . Otis is back there . Otis died ten minutes ago . That is not true ! Yeah ? Then check on him yourself . Hope , we should get back in the van . I 'm not hiding for the rest of my life , Wyatt . That 's your thing . Hope . Hope ! Otis ? Come on , buddy . Otis ? Come on , Otis ! Come on , Otis . Come on , boss . Come on . Come on . Stick with me . Come on , man . Son of a bitch ! God damn you motherfucker . Why 'd you pick us ? Why ? Motherfucker ! You like that ? You like that shit , huh ? Fifteen years ago , we were out on a hunting trip . You know all about hunting trips , don 't ya . Don 't you ! It was me , Wyatt ... Otis and Cody ... And Timmy . Yeah , you fucking remember You fucking remember . You fucking remember that shit ! We were just kids But Timmy ... You remember Timmy . You killed our friend . Now you 're gonna pay for it . You 're gonna fucking die . See what it feels like . Feel what it feels like . Duke ! Duke . Oh , shit . Fuck . Cody . Cody . Holy shit . What the fuck , Duke . Shit , Duke . You 're not supposed to be holding me like this . Shit . It 's okay . We could get help . You get help . I 'm going back . Take this , okay ? Won 't you need that ? No . Okay . I 'll drive you back . No . You stay on the road and keep driving . All right ? You don 't turn back for nothing . I won 't leave you . I need you to do this for me , Hope . No , I won 't leave you . Duke ? Duke . Duke . Duke . Duke . Wyatt . Duke . Where is it ? Where 'd it go ? It 's calling the others , Wyatt . Duke . You run , Wyatt . Go . Duke . Duke . Damn . Get off him , you fuck . Duke ! Nooooo ! Duke !

How does it feel to be probed , motherfucker ? Cody ? Oh , shit , Cody . I ain 't got time for this , man . We 've got some serious company coming . Cody . God damn it , Cody . You hear me , Cody ? Please . God damn it . Shit . Oh , God , Cody . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , man . God damn it , Cody . Listen to me ! Cody ! Oh , shit ! Oh , shit ! Oh , shit , Cody . Shit , Cody . Cody . Oh , Jesus . Cody . He 's had enough ! God damn it . He 's had enough ! I said that 's enough ! I know what they want . Call them off . I 'll go with you . Call them off ! Just leave Cody alone . And don 't hurt anybody else . And I 'll go with you . They 'll give you a ribbon or something , you piece of shit ! No ! This is between you and me ! Nobody else ! I said call it off and I 'll go with you ! I 'll go with you ! I 'll go with you ! You 're not going anywhere with them . Van 's down the road . Let 's go . Wyatt . Cody ? Cody . Timmy was never really good with pain , was he ? He was a real pussy , wasn 't he ? I need you to do what you did to Timmy . I didn 't ... I didn 't do ... Please , Wyatt . You were his best friend . Please , Wyatt . Come on . Come on . Come on . Hurry . Come on , Hope . Get in . Hope , get in . Come here . Cover your ears . What the fuck . Where now ? Somewhere else .

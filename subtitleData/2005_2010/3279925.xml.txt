 [ SARAH 'S SPEAKING NARRATOR ] There are those who believe that a child in her womb shares his mother 's dreams . Her love for him . Her hopes for his future . ls it told to him in pictures while he sleeps inside her ? ls that why he reaches for her in that first moment and cries for her touch ? But what if you 'd known since he was inside you what his life held for him ? That he would be hunted . That his fate was tied to the fate of millions . That every moment of your life will be spent keeping him alive . Would he understand why you were so hard ? Why you held on so tight ? Will he still reach for you if the only dream you ever shared with him was a nightmare ? Would he know my love runs through him like blood ? John , now . Now ! - The cops make you at the diner ? - I don 't know . Maybe . Yes . Definitely . [ POLICE ] Sarah Connor ! John Connor ! Drop what you 're carrying . Put your hands on your head and kneel on the ground . Now ! [ GRUNT ] Do me a favor , will you ? Fix it . [ GROANING ] [ SIREN WAILING ] POLICE : Drop your weapon ! Move ! You run ! Run ! [ SPEAKING DISTORTED IN SILENCE ] John ! John . John . John . John ? John ? Do it ! Do it ! Kill me ! Nothing matters anymore . Kill me ! You 're right . Nothing matters anymore . Only the boy . The future 's ours . And it begins now . [ RUMBLES / EXPLOSION ] [ GASP ] Did you scream or something ? Scream ? No . Go back to sleep . I can 't . Got an early shift . Are you all right ? I 'm good . - Yeah ? - I 'm great . Well , you damn well better be . You know , the guy down at the store told me any woman would be lucky to have this ring . He doesn 't know the giver like I do . You wanna know a secret ? I don 't know . I don 't like secrets . No ? This is a good one . - Really ? - Yeah . All right . John picked it out . Sort of . You know I 'd been looking and looking and I ... kinda starting freaking myself out with the whole color and cut and clarity ... So you turned the job over to a 15-year-old boy . You think I 'm a jackass , don 't you ? I 'm thinking I love you . Always rember that . Early shift . - Better get going . - Right . Early shift . Bye . Season 1 Episode 1 Pilot ( v. 1.00 ) [ GASP ] Mom , how many times have I told you it 's freaky when you do that ? I 'm sorry . What 's going on ? We can 't stay here , John . What ? It 's not safe . Not safe from who ? No one knows us . No one asks questions . It 's been almost two years . School starts in , like , three weeks . - We need to go . - No , you need to go . You 're scared . He gave you a ring and now you 're freaking out . I know you like him . So do you , mom ! So do you . You love him , I know you do . Listen to me . The cops will never find us . We 're safe . Don 't you think that , John ! Don 't you ever think that . Look at me ! No one is ever safe . Half an hour . One bag . Plus the guns . I 'll make pancakes . [ SARAH ] Every family has rules . And we had ours . Keep your head down , keep your eyes up , resist the urge to be seen as important or special . Know your exits . I mean , she 's not exactly missing , right ? - The way you explain it . - Right . The way I explained it , she 's not missing . She left . Happens more than you think . You don 't know her . I can say the same to you , Mr. Dixon . FBI ? Been together long ? Six months , maybe . Bit of a whirlwind . You have no idea , the whirlwind . Tell me , does the Skynet defense system mean anything to you ? No . How about this guy ? Miles Dyson . No . Never seen him before . That 's because he 's dead . Your fiancee , freshly escaped from the pescadero mental hospital , blew him apart two years ago . Leveled a four story research lab along with him . But since there 's no lethal injection for the destruction of property , let 's just stick with the murder of one of our county 's brightest computer scientists . And ... dedicated family man . That 's ... it 's just not ... Why would she do that ? Well , you know , Mr. Dixon . It 's the robots . The ones from the future . The ones Skynet sent to kill her son . Which makes total sense . Because , in the future , John 's not only her son , but ... What does it say here ? " The leader of the resistance fighting artificially intelligent machines determined to annihilate the human race . " Did he strike you that way ? Leader of a scrappy band of rebels ? Luke Skywalker type ? He 's just a kid . He 's a great kid . He was like a son to me . I came down here for help . You can 't really be asking me this ! No . I 'm not . This is just my patter , Mr. Dixon . This is just me impressing upon you that I 'm not here because you lost your fiancee . Love of your life and all-around good time girl . I 'm here because my boss , the United States of America , thinks Sarah Connor is a deluded ...

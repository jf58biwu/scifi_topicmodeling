 Hi , I 'm Amanda Tapping from the television series " Sanctuary . " In May 2007 , the series first went online in the form of eight 15-minute webisodes . What you 're about to see is the original one-hour pilot for that series . This footage has never been aired on television until now . Enjoy . Lonely tonight , gentlemen ? Still at it , Molly ? Oh ... Mr. Druitt . You frightened me . No rest for the gifted . You know that . Indeed I do . You shouldn 't be in the habit of jumping out at the ladies these days , what with all the troubles . What was I thinking ? - Forgive me . - HELEN : John ! This ends here . Helen ... What a lovely surprise . Molly , I would like you to meet my fiancé , or should I say former fiancé , Helen Magnus . Dr. Helen Magnus . Doctor ? I 'm pleased to meet you , Ma 'am . Well ... - I 'll be on my way . - Stay . I insist . John , let me help you before you make things worse . And how is that possible ? I 've already murdered , what , seven whores ? How could one more make the slightest difference ? Murdered ? You are ... What more have I to lose ? Your power 's driving you mad , John . I can help . My power is all I have left . Let her go . As the lady wishes . Dispatch , this is Seven David Five , responding to a 10-11 at 149th and Willis . Roger that , Seven David Five . Open up , police ! Let 's go ! Open up ! Evening , Ma 'am . We 've had some complaints about the noise . We want no trouble . Then you don 't mind if we come in ? No . No . You folks want to just come right out and tell me why we got a call to come here tonight ? We have trouble early tonight , but no trouble now . - Yeah , what kind of trouble ? - Please ... You go . Ma 'am , I 'm going to enter this room . Please , step aside . - Please ... - Everything will be fine . Russo ! Seven David Five , requesting backup on that 10-11 . - Roger that . - EMS response , stat . Copy that , Seven David Five . It 's a kid . Hey , kid , you okay ? It 's okay . Look , see ? It 's okay . Just reach out and grab my hand , okay ? Just reach out ... Come on , just grab my hand . Come on . Just grab my hand , okay ? I said come here ! Monsters strange creatures that walk the Earth , searching for innocent victims . Ready to strike at any moment . These creatures , such as the legendary Sasquatch , or Bigfoot , can exist in any climate on Earth , in any city , in any town . And someday they may be coming to visit you . Will ! Your parents are pulling in . Remember our deal , okay ? Okay . Just a stupid movie . No such thing as monsters . No such thing as monsters . No such thing as monsters . Thank you . - Somebody page me ? - Excuse me , Doctor . - Have a nice nap ? - No , not really . Consult . Homicide suspect . Real heavy hitter . Anyone we know ? Oh , man , you are going to love this one . Great . This is harassment , plain and simple . You will all be hearing from my lawyer . Especially you , Tom Cruise . I know you 're the one who shot me . - Or was it you , hmm ? - Oh , come on . Look , we both know your lawyer 's too freaked out to be in the same room with you , so let 's just kill the music and lay our cards on the table , shall we ? Okay . Okay , you want me to lay it out , hmm ? - Yeah . - Alright , well , you know , your dollar-store cologne stinks . That 's funny . You whacked six people tonight , including two cops . You think this is harassment ? We 're not even in the vicinity yet . Really ? You know , you could always just use deodorant . Whoa ! Hey ! Whoa , hey , guys , guys , guys . I got it from here . I got it from here . LARRY : Will Z. Thank God . Eminem . Long time , no see . You want to get detective Gitmo off my back ? Kavanaugh . - Zimmerman . - I hear you need an eval . Yeah , well , you heard wrong . Look , just patch him up . - We 'll handle the rest . - See , that 's a threat . They 're not even trying to hide it ! Alright , Joe , Joe , sidebar . Make it fast . Uptown wants him arraigned like yesterday . Me , I 'm just dying for a chance to shoot his ass . I know what happened tonight , but Tolson used to be a patient of mine . Why don 't you give me a few minutes alone with him ? You know , maybe I can shake some stuff loose for you . At the very least , I 'll save you a disciplinary hearing . Alright , let 's give him the room . I hope you know what you 're doing . Let 's go . Come on . So ... You look good , Doc . Alone with Eminem . Zimmerman always did have serious balls . - M and who ? - The Manderville Monster . Did 12 years in Ivy Heights after killing his foster parents . Got out a couple of months ago . Guess people don 't change , do they ? I suppose not . You working on the sequel rights there , Larry ? No way , no how . Not this time . So then why the escort service and the bullet in the leg ? Ask them . One minute I 'm watching Discovery Channel , the next , I 'm surrounded by cops . I ask for a warrant , and they shoot me . Yeah , well , they found you watching TV , alright , but you were surrounded by corpses . - Did you lose your meds ? - No . No , that 's not it . Hey , look , the studio audience is gone , Larry . It 's just me . Alright ? And I need to hear the truth . Alright . I dropped in on the family downstairs . All the yelling and the ... Screaming . I 'm nothing if not ... Neighborly , right ? - Yelling and screaming ? - Oh , yeah . There 's like 50 of ' em living down there . There 's , like , young ones and old ones , and it 's like Red Square 24 / 7 , you know what I 'm saying ? So you just went down to complain about the noise ? Didn 't kill anyone this time . Promise . I heard what was going on , so I went down to check out the kid 's technique . That 's all . - The kid ? - The russkie kid . Except he wasn 't a kid , was he ? He was ... Special . - Special ? What does that mean ? - Think about it , Doc . It 's two cops . Just ... Bang . Bang . Just like ... That takes talent , you know ? Believe me , I know . The kid ... The kid has ... The kid has serious juice . Is that the real version , Larry ? Because I 'm not feeling any love here . - On the level ? - Yeah . They think I whacked the Bolsheviks . Hell , it 's fine with me . I miss my room in the I 've , you know ? But the way he took out the cops ... The truth ? The truth ... Yeah . - Larry ? - The kid . Will , you don 't want to find him . - Fresh meat coming through ! - Subtle . Russo , Albert and Birch , Lawrence . Two cops . Bit it tonight uptown . Yeah , we 've been expecting them . Put them in holding . Got four more coming later . EMS says it was a real butcher shop . Aren 't they all these days ? - Helen ? - Eleanor . - They 're in the cold room . - Thank you . - Lunch next week ? - Love to . I 'll call . I know what it looks like , but he 's not your man . Convicted psycho just wanders into a preexisting bloodbath ? Cut the crap , Zimmerman . He 's our guy . Trust me , Tolson did not kill those people . Look , severe cranial lacerations , removal of gray matter ? I read his jacket . This is our guy 's kind of party . Yeah , and this time he was just a guest , not the host . Larry Tolson has a very specific form of delusional psychosis . He kills for reasons that you or I think are crazy , but they make sense to him . 12 years ago . Why did he kill his foster parents ? I don 't know , something about their brains stealing power from him . He sees people as either conduits or siphons . If he thinks you 're trying to steal his energy , he feels threatened , and that 's when he kills . Believe me , forensics will go through the whole nine yards , they won 't find one shred of DNA to link him . Sorry , man , but they pay me to do my homework . Okay . Whoa . Zimmerman ... Let 's just say that I buy this psycho-crap defense , which you know I don 't . Then who the hell did it ? That 's your job , Joe . It 's not mine . HELEN : Hard to believe such an outlandish story , isn 't it ? WILL : Excuse me ? HELEN : The Manderville Monster . It would have been easy to lay the blame directly at his feet . And yet you didn 't . Well done . - Nice to know I have fans . - You saw it , didn 't you ? Saw what ? You saw the clarity in Mr. Tolson 's eyes when he told you who did kill those people . Look , not that it 's any of your business , but all I saw were the ramblings of a delusional psychotic . So it wasn 't Tolson . It was someone just like him . Except such carnage could never be the work of a madman , could it ? The police may think it possible , but you don 't . Listen , it 's late , and I 've got to ... He told you about the boy , didn 't he ? A child capable of such murderous destruction he just had to see it for himself . Mr. Tolson was there as an admirer , was he not ? There was no boy . No ordinary boy . Look , who are you ? How do you know about this ? I 've heard such accounts many times before . As for who I am ... A friend . I hope . Hello ? Okay , who the hell just used my can ? Hey . Station 's closed , pal . Buddy . What the hell 's going on ? You know what ? I don 't wanna know . You just stay put . Control 4 , this is Railcheck 2 . I 've got a pick-up on the southbound platform at ... Some privacy , if you please . We 're just getting to know each other . I am so sick of that . Will , my friend , you are on fire tonight . Good . You 're awake . Considering I 'm looking at a photo of you and Joe Louis , I don 't think so . I apologize for my boldness this evening . Woman from earlier , creepy house , wacked photos . Probably working through some childhood stuff , bed-wetting issues , night fears ... Still , this is good stuff , even for me . Dr. Zimmerman , I assure you I am real . As is this place and everything in it . No . See , that 's impossible . Because if this place is real , and I did pass out here , then that means that ... Oh , cr ... I love the dark . It 's such a wonderful feeling , letting the blackness envelop you , hide you , protect you from harm . I know all too well what it is like to be different . To have others hate me , fear me . The way he fears you . Fulfill your desires to your heart 's content , hmm ? With one condition . I need your help . To find an old friend ? My manservant seems to have a profound impact on you . Yeah , if you call 15 years of therapy down the drain " profound . " My patients and I are unused to visitors . I should have given you some warning , I suppose . - That thing is your patient ? - Former patient , actually . After I removed more than a few bullets from his body , he refused to leave . So I gave him a position on my staff . Although I must say , he brews tea as poorly as a short-order cook . - He flushed me out of my shower . - Did he use your toilet ? Oh , that is so annoying . I 'll be sure to have a word with him . No , no , it 's not the toilet flushing that bothers me . It 's the kidnapping . And the fact that he 's a ... Well , he can 't help who he is . Okay , you know what ? This has been great , but I 'm overdue for a round of heavy drinking and some tranquilizers , so ... If I could just have my clothes , please . As you wish . But outside that door are creatures that make my butler seem like a house cat by comparison . " Sanctuary for all " is not an empty motto . Scone ? Railcheck 2 , this is Blue Rider 9 . Respond . Respond , Railcheck 2 . Nothing . Hate this goddamn sector . Hey , no one likes working under Old City . Too many bad memories . What if the guy caught an express ? He could be up in Gunns Landing , for all we know , or friggin ' Sentinel Green . He was checking the switches on the number four line near 149th . - I 'm thinking he didn 't go far . - Yeah , yeah . Yeah , I 'm thinking you 're right . WILL : So , you 're a doctor of what , exactly ? Depends on the patient , of course . Of course . You spent eight years of your life studying medicine . For what ? So you can practice a profession that has almost nothing to do with the reality of the world around you . Whoa . How about a little context with that character assassination ? That I can provide . I specialize in terology , among other things . I 'm sorry , " terology " ? Combined with healthy doses of cryptozoology and xenobiology as well , when the need arises . Please . Terology , from the Greek " teras , " meaning hideous creature , deformity , unknown being . New guy ! Hey ! New guy ! New guy ! New guy ! Stop it , both of you . I apologize . They 're incorrigible . None of these things are running around free , right ? Don 't be ridiculous . Exercise time isn 't for another two hours . HELEN : The purpose of this institute is to find and help the unfortunate creatures of this world . And , Dr. Zimmerman , I believe there is a vital role for you to play here . You want me to help you capture monsters ? I prefer to call them " abnormals " . Please . - You find my offer amusing ? - Yes . - Because you 're afraid . - You work with monsters . I work with sentient beings , each worthy of the same respect that humans , even animals , receive automatically . They are the key to the evolution of our race , and yet we revile them , destroy them , and worst of all , pretend they don 't even exist . But they are out there , Dr. Zimmerman . Lost , like children . Misunderstood . Hunted . Are they really so different from the outcasts you treat every day ? You knew Mr. Tolson was telling you the truth . And in that one moment , I saw that you were capable of so much more . I believed some of his story . That doesn 't make me Jekyll to your Hyde . - Or whatever the right combo is . - Open your eyes . Good doctors come and go . But the really great ones have always seen beyond the boundaries of science , beyond the known . The great ones dare to believe in the unbelievable . - He must be close . - Who ? Our quarry . WILL : So how did you know the killer 's next victim would be down here , and not , you know , up ? Uptown ? I have my sources . Could you be a little more cryptic , please , because I was starting to feel in the loop there , and we wouldn 't want that . Our subject is unused to human contact . He would seek refuge in these catacombs , if only for the solitude . Plus I have a police scanner . And how do you know the victim was the work of the subject ? Because I 've been tracking the little dweeb all night . Hi . With very little success , I 'm afraid . Well , that 's because someone else was down here . Tall dude . Moves faster than me , if that 's possible . What did he look like ? - Bald , trench coat ... - Uh , guys ? Hey . Hey , uh ... It 's okay . It 's okay . Stop ! We need him alive . We want to help you . Do you understand me ? Whoa ! Hey ! Hey ! Over here . Over here . WILL : Yeah , that 's it . That 's it . Okay . Easy ... A little help here , please ? - You okay ? - I 'm fine . Far from it . This chaos was completely avoidable . Give me a break , okay ? I 've been avoiding cops , ghouls , and God-knows-what else in stinky , dark tunnels all night . I need food , I need a bath . I don 't need a lecture . Okay , so I 'm getting that you two know each other . Dr. Zimmerman , this is Ashley . My daughter . Mom ! Take it easy . I believe we have discussed better coordinating our efforts when attempting a capture , have we not ? Again , we got the ghoul , okay ? Take a pill . Watch your cheek with me , young lady , especially with company present . I apologize for Ashley 's unruly behavior , Dr. Zimmerman . What she lacks in refinement , I assure you she more than makes up for in skill . - Really ? - Hey , I saved your life . - Hold still . - Yeah . Thanks . - So I take it you guys do this a lot ? - Oh , this is nothing . After our Romania trip last year , we had more plasma flowing than ... Ashley , please . I don 't like it when you glorify our work . An entire den of werewolves . Me , mom and a some loser Romanian lupus wrangler . We 're low on silver tips , full moon 's on the rise . That was a party . Do you mean like " werewolf " werewolves ? - Mom , seriously , who is this guy ? - Dr. Zimmerman is our guest . Please , try to keep that in mind as you blather away . There , my darling . Good as new . Hate to bleed and run , but I 've got to be on the East Side in 20 . Hot date . With Ernie . Nice to meet you . Um , keep the ice going . Don 't wait up . So she 's your daughter ? Because there can 't be more than , like , 12 years difference between you two . The details are unimportant . Ashley is my flesh and blood , and she plays a vital role in my work . She bags them , you tag ' em . Yeah , well , it works for me . So you found this inside one of the victims ? Looks like some sort of phosphorous-based chemical . Secretions from the boy 's appendage . Contains significant trace amounts of low-grade plutonium . But so tiny an amount is hardly lethal . Well , yeah , it 's more your department , so I 'm just going to . True enough . Right now there is an urgent need for your talents , Doctor . He is by estimation 10 years of age . Considering his family , I would say he was brought here via the eastern European black market . Such imperfect children are often adopted by well-meaning immigrant families . Some are blind . Others have deformities , mental illness . I 'm sure he seemed perfectly normal in his photograph , if they even saw one . What the hell is that thing ? I will only be able to determine his physiological state once we 've gained his trust . Okay , sit him up and release him . Uh , please . Okay , we 'll be fine . Really . WILL : How are you doing ? I 'm just going to grab this chair here . Nice and slowly . Watch them . DRUITT : Who are those actors ? I 've seen less wood sailing to Tahiti . John , stop it . I am merely saying Her Majesty was dead-on , barring that from an indefinite run . Truly dreadful , wasn 't it ? And your favorite play , too . But for the perfect vision to my left , I would have caught up on some much-needed sleep . Where to this evening ? A turn through Piccadilly to start , please . Very good , ma 'am . And where are you taking me now , woman ? Wherever I please . I 'll not have you home before midnight , John Druitt . Not before I 've had my way with you . Then the night awaits . I take it you 're feeling much better . There 's nothing like the attentions of a capable physician to cure the chronically ill . You were never ill . It was simply ... An element of my physiology as yet undiscovered by medicine . - You have done so much for me . - John , I hardly ... Let me speak , doctor . I 've spent my entire life lost in a void , afraid of who I am . Of what I am . If not for you , I fear I would have remained lost . Instead , I can now see that I am neither a freak of nature nor a devil . But a man . Very much in love . And someone who wishes to spend the rest of his life repaying his savior for all she 's done . I promise to make you happy , Helen , for all eternity . Whoa ! Hey ! Time ... Time out a second , okay ? Here 's the problem , alright ? If you keep that up , that big hairy guy is going to come back in here , and believe me , it will get ugly . The bigger problem is that he scares me more than you do . Okay , why aren 't you trying to eat my brain anymore ? Okay , I think I 'm getting the ground rules here . The less fear I feel , the less you want to snack on my cerebellum ? Okay . You have a name ? - Alexei . - Alexei . That 's a cool name . I 'm Will . I 'm gonna go out on a limb here and assume that you 're not from around here . From place with no people . The dead city . Want to tell me how this all started ? Family adopt me , bring me home . But they not like me . Not after . Yeah , not the kind of reception you were hoping for , huh ? They were afraid . I try to stop it , but only more fear comes . So the more fear , the more it comes out . It 's a defense mechanism . Well , that 's perfectly normal . Whenever you feel scared , that 's what 's going to happen . Magnificent . I know you like the firepower , Ash . That 's why I ordered these babies specially for you . Direct from my source in Tel Aviv . You take such good care of me , Ern . That 's why I keep coming back for more . Sure we 're kosher here , right ? I mean , I know Henry doesn 't appreciate any weapon he doesn 't make himself . Well , Henry 's gear is too experimental . I 'm a traditionalist . And when it 's your ass on the line , amen . So what else you need ? I got Kevlar , silver tips . If you 're goin ' after vamps , I know a brother in Prague who just received a shipment of holy water . Pressurized canisters , 5,000 psi launcher included . - Deal of a lifetime . - Stop it . You 're turning me on . How much for both ? Both ? Well , for you , Ash ? Six thou . But , I tell you what . We start pooling our resources , do some jobs together , my contacts become your contacts and visa versa , the price goes way south , if you know what I mean . Come on , Ernie . You know my mother has a few issues with the way that you work . So hate the game , not the players . That 's going to leave a mark . Nasty toy for someone so young . You just killed the second-best ghoul-tracker in five states . - Not to mention a friend . - Clumsy me . Have we met before ? A crypt somewhere ? I 'm an old family friend . Oh , and no card from you at Christmas . Oh well . Next year ! Now , young lady . I believe it 's past your bedtime . WILL : If you need anything during the night , you just ring that bell . Alright ? I won 't be too far away , Alexei . I promise . Wait . You are like the other man I met . In tunnel . He treat me well , too . What other man ? - State your emergency . - WILL : Hey , Doc . It 's me . You 've got a problem . Do not bite me . How did you know I was going to ? I would 've done the same . Okay , now you 've got my attention . And that 's quite an achievement , considering your bad taste in clothes . Oh , such manners for a lady . But then , look at your mother . She never understood her place in the world , either . Bad enough you 're a teleporting psycho , you 're Republican , too ? Well , let 's just say I am a strong believer in family values . Here 's some free advice : kidnapping me pisses my mom off more than serving the wrong wine with fish . So I 'd start running . Oh ... I 'm not going anywhere . Why would I , now that I finally have what I 've wanted for so long ? Yeah ? What 's that ? Why , you , of course . My daughter . HELEN : Are you quite certain ? WILL : Yeah , Alexei said he could jump instantly from place to place , if you buy that , which you will . - With a kind of bluish-green flash ? - You see ? It corroborates Ernest 's account of her abduction . - HELEN : Dammit . - WILL : It doesn 't make any sense . - Alexei had no reason to run . - He didn 't run . He was taken . - What the hell is this ? - Directions . To where ? There 's no station at 98th Street . There used to be , before the new city was built . That 's where we 'll find Alexei . And Ashley . You know who did this , don 't you ? His name is Montague John Druitt . He was my first patient . Meaning he 's not exactly normal . Through certain genetic abnormalities , he 's able to bend dimensional space at will . - Warp from place to place . - In a blue-green flash . Exactly . Well , I 'd say " cool , " if he wasn 't , you know , the bad guy . Each time he does it , specific portions of his brain are damaged , causing increased dementia , paranoia , rage . I discovered all this too late . His murderous habits were already well underway . I tried to stop him , and failed . - You 're sure it 's him . - Twelfth Night . His favorite play . A-5 , S-1 ? Act 5 , scene 1 ? " And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges . " Each of us has our worst fears to confront , Dr. Zimmerman . John Druitt is mine . What would you do if you did manage to free yourself ? Attack me ? Or go after the boy and hope I didn 't interfere ? Oh , I 'd definitely do you first " Dad . " Yes , I wouldn 't believe it , either . Such an outlandish , not to mention sordid tale . I know my mother . You 're not even close to her type . For starters , she 's likes her men sane and a lot less talky . Oh , she liked me well enough when she agreed to marry me . Okay , well , you have me . You have the ghoul . What 's next ? My butt 's getting cold . Imagine spending every hour of every day , every penny of your fortune , trying to find someone , only to discover you were looking in the wrong bloody century . Imagine the frustration , the anger , as the search went on , a fool 's errand . I moved from decade to decade , holding on to the one hope that I would finally land in the right time and place to find you , Ashley . My father is dead . Who told you that ? Oh , the good doctor ? My God , her gall never ceases to amaze me ! Who is she to play nursemaid to every deviant who 's lost its way ? Or more to the point , to decide that you should never know your own flesh and blood ? - Who is she to say ? - HELEN : I 'm her mother , that 's who ! Yeah , this is why I busted my ass in medical school . To crawl around in dirty tunnels , chasing mutant psychos . Keep it together , Will . The monsters are down there , not up here . I thought you were going to wait in the car . DRUITT : Helen you look wonderful . Stop playing games , John . You got what you wanted . Indeed . A family , at last . You played your cards very patiently . Well done . As if that could prevent this moment . Mom , please tell this guy there 's a nice padded cell in his future . Quiet , Ashley . Be reasonable . How could I tell her the truth ? How could you not ? You murdered eight innocent women . No ! Not yet . I 'm still waiting for the " it 's a total lie " part . Mom , he 's not my dad , right ? Please . This is neither the time nor place . Whatever you 're going to do , don 't . Actually , it 's you who 's going to do it all , Helen . Look at what you 've made of our daughter ! A foul-mouthed , willful , violent child . But at the core a needy little girl who just misses her dad . And this your beloved creatures . The damned souls you so tirelessly try to save . It is all up to you , Helen . Make your choice ! What will it be ? Don 't . This is entertaining . I know you 're quick , John , but if memory serves , bullets are quicker . Memory is a fickle companion . No , don 't ! Let me . Alexei , wait . What now , John ? I die like one of your whores ? Tell me what choice I have . - You want to hurt me . - No , I don 't . I want to help you . Other people might be afraid of you , but I 'm not . Why ? Because there 's no such thing as monsters . Forgive me , John . You can 't control her forever , Helen . Stop . You 'll never survive . Easy , guys . You actually exist . I was ... I am scared of you . But I know it 's just the idea of you . The concept . You see , I saw this movie when I was a kid , and I had an over-active imagination , and ... Never mind . Just get better . Will . You used to live over in Barron County . Yeah , when I was a kid . East Hills . 1123 Seneca Boulevard . Before I met the doctor , I ... I was angry . I enjoyed scaring people . Kids . I knew that movie was playing that night , and ... And I 'm sorry . It was you ? I know it is late in coming , but no hard feelings ? WILL : Sure you 're okay ? ASHLEY : I wasn 't at my best back there . WILL : Well , considering the situation ... Yeah , well , if you 're thinking about working here , um , you should really see this . MAN : Will you stop fiddling with that thing ? Let 's just get this over with . Huh ? Come on , make yourself useful or something , huh ? Go get me a cream soda . What the heck was I talking about ? Oh , yeah . New guy , if you 're watching this , that means she 's dragged you into this whole little circus of hers , huh ? Well , I was once young like you . A year out of medical school . It was 1932 or something . I was finishing night shift at the hospital , walking home , and she came outta the shadows , this woman . She hands me this business card . After that I was just caught in her web . You know , we were studying the abnormals , and we got to be very close . We had a ... A special bond , Helen and I. She had ideas about things ... He rambles a bit here . I begged and I pleaded with her to stop . I didn 't think I could take it anymore , you know ? Different things from the fridge ... No , no . ... been given an opportunity to learn things . Things that no one else can ever know . And there will be risks . There will be sacrifices . At best , a chance of some light death , some maiming , could be in the cards . But what is that in the face of knowing the truth . The truth about humankind ? Hey , glue guy . Glue guy , I just I lost another fingernail . What do I gotta do ? Where are you ? Don 't sneak up on me like that . Anyway ... Good luck , new guy . Just keep your head up , keep your eyes open . And stay away from anything , anything radioactive . I don 't care how cute and fluffy it is . And you tell Helen ... You tell Helen that ... Tell her that Barney says hello . She 'll know what that means . Anyway , I gotta get someone to husk down my corns ... Nice . HELEN : Leaving , Dr. Zimmerman ? Well , after watching Barney TV , can you blame me ? Look , I just wanted to say thank you . It was a lot of fun . - As traumatic as it was . - You 're turning down my offer . Yeah . I already have a job . At that zoo they laughingly call a hospital . Cold-hearted bureaucrats and uneducated sloths . Hey , don 't forget about the free jello . Ah . So why linger ? Off you go . Is Alexei ? I 've secured a place for him at a special school I know . He 'll be fine . And what about Ashley ? Some pretty heavy news about her dad . I will deal with my daughter , have no fear . Was there something else ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's you . And Druitt . Something about it still doesn 't make sense to me . Pray tell . Barney , 1932 . And the way you talk . Those " Sherlock Holmes " expressions . I mean , who says " pray tell " ? And Druitt was the same way . Proper use of the Queen 's English is a lost art . No , no , no . Let 's just forget about the very disturbing fact that you have a basement full of monsters and your butler shouldn 't exist . Let 's talk about you and this guy , okay ? You claim that your first patient was Montague John Druitt , a man who also happens to be Scotland Yard 's prime suspect in the Ripper killings in 1888 . I told you he could bend dimensional space . - Why not time as well ? - So he 's the actual Ripper ? Come on , you can 't know that , not for sure . Indeed I can , Dr. Zimmerman . I was there . So you can travel through time , too ? I cannot . But you said that Ashley was your flesh and blood , so ... She is . I kept the embryo frozen for over a century , until I could bear the loneliness no longer . I brought it to term , believing John was gone for good . I underestimated his determination . How is any of this possible ? When you treat beings with extraordinary powers , sometimes the rewards are ... Well , unexpected . - So that means that you ... - I am 157 years old . Weren 't you leaving ? Your gratuitous jello awaits . You know , I hoped that at least you would be normal . Sorry to disappoint . Can you promise me that I 'm not going to end up like Barney ? No , I can 't do that . But I can promise you the adventure of many , many lifetimes . Shall we begin ?

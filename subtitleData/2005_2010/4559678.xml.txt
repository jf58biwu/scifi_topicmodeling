 I was just trying to help her . I was just trying to help her . - PAM : Thanks for covering , Priya . - Oh , I sold a necklace for you . A talkative young man bought one for his fianc√©e . PAM : No kidding ? I should have you sell my junk for me all day . Oh , your jewelry sells itself . Well , the Aussie princess can 't hurt . Hey , do they have royalty in Australia ? We have a queen , yes , but it 's the same one they have in England , fickle bitch . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Oh . Speaking of princes , he 's back . - Not my type . - Why not ? You 're certainly his . So , what are you doing with all these pieces anyway ? Not using them for firewood , I hope . I 'm a collector , and you 're the real deal . You shouldn 't be selling on Venice Beach with all this novelty crap . Well , I need the cash , and I don 't have a work visa . ( SINGING ) So ... Would you ever be interested in making something for me ? Something very large ? Like an elephant ? ( LAUGHING ) No . Like a painting , a big painting that would cost a lot more money . Oh . You 're loaded , too . I 'm ... I 'm overpaid . Well , did you have something specific you would want ? Yes . You to do your thing . You know , maybe I could even arrange a show . All right ? So , here . Let me know . PAM : Ooh . See , you hit the jackpot , girl . PARTY GUEST : And Nolan commissioned this ? Because I don 't think I have reason to live if I can 't have one of your paintings for myself . Wow . You must have a really boring life . Oh , you 're funny . ( LAUGHS ) She 's funny , too , Anton . MAN : Hi , good to see you . There she is , the woman of the hour . - Man , Nolan wasn 't kidding . - About what ? Well , he said the art was almost as beautiful as the artist . Yeah . Nolan likes to say things like that . I 'm not as good as these people tell me . How good you are is history 's business . You 're doing what you love and these folks want to pay you for it . These aren 't really my kind of folks . I plan to be moving on . Well , a few showings like this and you can move on and on , anywhere you want . You should stick with Nolan . He finds an artist , they thrive . This is an elaborate , expensive seduction , Nolan . I mean , it 's the least Rossum can do after all of your work with us , but couldn 't we just buy her a necklace or a boat or something ? I 've tried all that , but she 's an artist . Free spirit , Harding . She can 't be bought . But she can be lured . We 'll see . Why don 't you let us build the woman you want ? The perfect woman . We have all types available . I don 't want a doll , Harding . I want her . - He 's crazy about your work . - It 's not all about the work . No , sweetie . It 's about the power . There 's a ton of money in this room , but that 's not power . Nolan 's a medical genius , shortlisted for the Nobel . That 's power . Art is power because they can 't make it . So what if you make Nolan all cute and nervous ? Why not ride that a little ? ( CHUCKLE NERVOUSLY ) Let them think they have the power . Our time will come . Sorry , darling . Luca 's chomping at the bit . Priya , this is Luca Pallidio , the finest art dealer in all of Italy . Not true . ( GREETING IN ITALIAN ) Oh , hello . I love the piece . It 's very organic , effortless . You mind if I ask you many boring questions ? Not at all . Mr. Harding , always a pleasure . Most people who are as rich and good-Iooking as Nolan don 't have good taste , but your work reminds me of Bernard Patin . Is he an influence ? I 'm embarrassed to say I don 't know who that is . Is that bad ? Well , no . It 's natural . People kill for that , to be unaffected . Unlike everyone here . ( BOTH CHUCKLE ) - So why the bird motif ? - ( SIGHS ) I don 't know . I just think they 're beautiful . That 's it . Perhaps it is a reflection of you , no ? Free , always moving , searching for something better ? - I don 't need better . - No . You move because there is wind . - Do you want to get out of here ? - I 'd love to . Okay . We can talk some more about Nolan . - Sneaking out ? - I was just looking for you to say goodbye . Why are you so eager to leave ? I mean , everyone 's here to adore you . - Enjoy the painting , Nolan . - Come on , come on . Stay a little longer , Priya . The painting 's yours . My job here is done . I 'm going now . Why ? So you can give it up to some guy you just met ? - He 's not even real . - Hey . - What ? - ( WHISPERS ) Would you like a treatment ? - You were supposed to help me . - Oh , you don 't need my help . You are like the bull , strong yet with the horns . - Fierce . - Wait . After my treatment , I find you . ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) - Goodbye . - I pulled out all the stops . I mean , this is our big night . - We 've planned for this . - No , this isn 't our night . - There 's no " we " . - Look , I have ... I 've offered you everything . - What else do you want ? - I want to walk out the damn door . Hey , hey . What did you expect , huh ? Day after day , just dangling it in front of my face , - seducing me . - Seducing ? You 're crazy , Nolan . It 's all in your head . Get off me . I 'm sorry . I 'm not gonna take no for an answer . - All right , I 'll do anything . - Stop it ! You disgust me . Nothing in this world could ever make me love you . Mmm . - When can I see you again ? - I don 't know . Soon . Oh , wait . Wait . To remember you . I love you . VICTOR : I like your bird . Thank you . I don 't like this color , though . VICTOR : Why do you use it ? It 's always here . ( GASPING ) ( EX CLAIMS ) It should work . Well , it doesn 't work . It works in theory . Alpha got it to work through a phone nonetheless . Are you comparing my intelligence to Alpha 's ? Well , you 're talking to yourself like he does . That 's a very good point . - What 's good ? - Mother ship . ( EX CLAIMS ) You gotta stop doing that or I 'll make you wear a bell . - Aw . You shouldn 't have . - Sierra made it . That 's very thoughtful of you , but I don 't think there 's room on my fridge . ( EX CLAIMING ) You 're like a ninja . Sierra hates the bad man . Who 's the bad man ? It 's not like the others . He makes her sad over and over . Well , it 's a fairly primitive rendition . I 'm not sure if this is a man , let alone which one . Hmm . You 're not looking hard enough . You never do . What 's the word on this repeat client Sierra 's been seeing ? - Why ? - Something 's bothering me about it . I have a hunch something 's wrong . ( LAUGHS ) That 's funny ? That I have a hunch ? That it 's bothering you . Nolan Kinnard . Big time Rossum VIP , MD , PhD in Molecular Pharmacology . Wrote his dissertation on neuroleptics . Works a lot with sick kids . Do you want me to make this profile available to you on the system ? What about the engagements ? You designed them . Tame . Yeah , your typical romance or seduction scenarios . Sierra 's stress levels never go higher than a 1.3 . Always comes back with a clean bill of health . I helped Sierra , you know . She was a paranoid schizophrenic when she came here , psychotic . And I helped her . I didn 't ask . Is that where your hunch came from ? Yeah . It 's Sierra 's . Echo brought it to me . She was going on about a bad man . He 's the blotch here is what I 'm getting . Echo brought it to you ? She 's always been mother hen about Sierra . - You should look into that . - I am . And so far , Echo 's given me way more than you have . I need a connection , a pattern . Saunders . Saunders ? She 's gone , Boyd . You got to stop mooning . Saunders didn 't work engagements . She looked after the Actives here . - She would 've seen . - Seen what ? A pattern . " Dark shape always present . " Must be something from her past ? " I can only conclude that if the dark shapes " don 't symbolize Sierra 's state of mind before intake , " they must represent an extreme sense of anxiety " and rage associated with ... " I 'm not the bad man . Sierra doesn 't like this color . You should take them all . - Is this wrong ? - No , it 's good . You 're taking charge . You 're taking matters into your own hands . They 're in my shirt . What are you up to , girl ? Huh . Echo was right . I wasn 't looking hard enough . - What ? - Neuroleptics . - He 's an expert . - You mean Kinnard ? Neuroleptics are anti-psychotics , right ? Like haloperidol or good old chlorpromazine . Most of them block D2 receptors in the dopamine pathways of the brain . I 'll take your word for it . Look . This is a brain , normal , boring brain , like your brain . This is a brain on drugs , or more specifically , anti-psychotic medication . You see the inhibited mesolimbic pathway ? The partially blocked serotonin receptors ? And this is Priya 's original scan . It 's similar , right ? But why the 5-HT efflux in the striatum ? And looking closer , increased conduction of chloride ions . - They 're at odds . - You lost me at brain . Priya wasn 't psychotic despite her heavy medication . She was psychotic because of it . And that 's not all . When Saunders conducted that wish fulfillment exercise a few months back , you said that Sierra went to the mental health clinic to confront the doctor who diagnosed her . - Dr. Makido . - Wrong . Sierra went to confront Nolan . Nolan Kinnard owns that clinic . He owns the whole complex , and he has a penthouse office there . - Sierra went to see him . - How did this get by DeWitt ? We got to tell her . She 's gonna flip her biscuits . Unless ... You don 't think she already knows ? ADELLE : She does now . Thank you so much for coming in , Dr. Kinnard . No , I 've been meaning to schedule another appointment anyway . Yeah , it seems the moment you take her away , I 'm ready to have her back . No doubt . And no doubt that 's why you 've asked me here , to caution me yet again about your policy on repeat engagements , right ? In a way . You know I 'm not interested in any of your other Actives ? Oh , that 's a non-issue . I would no sooner allow you near one of our other Actives than I would a mad dog near a child . I beg your pardon ? Given that you 're a raping scumbag one tick shy of a murderer . I can 't recall , do you take sugar ? All right . What the hell 's going on here , Adelle ? Oh , there 's nothing going on . In fact , it 's finished . We will no longer be providing you with our services . You have made me an accomplice in something vile , Dr. Kinnard , and it ends now . - Does it ? - Yes , it does . What are you gonna do , Adelle ? Go to the police ? Not really in a position to do that , are you ? I am , however , in a position to see to it that you never lay a hand on that woman ever again . And that is exactly what I intend to do . You know what ? I think you 're right about this repeat engagement thing . It 's not a good idea . So let 's stop dancing around your policy , all right ? You 're gonna imprint her , and you 're gonna send her to me forever . Excuse me ? You do it by the end of business today , I 'll see to it you keep your job . Thanks for the tea . I can 't believe what you 're asking me to do . The girl was a basket case , Adelle , hearing voices , drooling in her soup . You saw it yourself . Because he made her that way . Adelle , we 're being asked to place this young woman into a life of wealth and privilege , married to a man she adores . Do you really want to go to Rossum with this and accuse one of their most valued assets of being a kidnapper and rapist ? That is what he is . And if we do this , what does it make us ? What are we already ? We 're not slave merchants . Mr. Harding , I won 't do this . However she got here , she 's here , in my house , and therefore , in my care . Yes . And you would never let anyone take advantage of any of your charges , would you , Ms. Lonelyhearts ? Whatever indiscretions I may be guilty of ... Forget Victor . We don 't care . Everyone likes to take a little something home from the office once in a while . But he 's the least of your indiscretions . I think we both know that . If feeling that you 're somehow decent and moral helps you get through your day , that 's your business . This house , however , is our business . And you will run it the way we tell you to , or we 'll find someone who will . And I promise , you wouldn 't like the early retirement plan . Imprint the girl , send her to him , close the account . Victor ? What are you doing ? Now you don 't have to use this color anymore . ( LAUGHING ) You look like an Indian chief . I am an Indian chief . Orders , Sergeant . Orders . What do we do ? I don 't want to take charge . I don 't want to take charge . I 'm here . It 's okay . It 's okay . You can 't let them do this . They 're not going to do it . We are . And when I say we don 't have a choice , know that I mean it . Aren 't we supposed to care for these people ? - Dr. Saunders would never have allowed ... - Which Dr. Saunders would that be ? The avuncular physician so brutally cut down not 5 feet from where you were standing ? Or the last woman to whom you gave a permanent imprint ? The other wounded flower you restored by offering her a new life , who apparently found you so unbearable she had to flee the city . Is it that one ? How can you expect me to do this ? You 'll do it because you must . The cold reality is that everyone here was chosen because their morals have been compromised in some way . Everyone except you . You , Topher , were chosen because you have no morals . You have always thought of people as playthings . This is not a judgment . You always take very good care of your toys . But you 're simply going to have to let this one go . Sierra , it 's time for your treatment . All right . Victor , would you like to come with me ? I 'd like to , yes . No . No . No . Victor can 't come with you . - Why not ? - He just can 't . Okay ? Okay , I 'm sorry . I 'll wait for you right here . So she can remember . ( PHONE RINGING ) This is Boyd . Topher is having problems following commands . Please make sure he follows this one so I don 't have to resort to drastic measures . What 's the order ? The order is to keep the dolls in their place . Topher , have you completed your report on Sierra 's last engagement ? Oh , you mean her last engagement ever ? ( LAUGHING ) How about a verbal report ? Hearn 's an idiot . Thanks for the treatment , Shaggy . No problem , l-can 't-remember-your-name-today . I would like to report Hearn called me a nerd . Is he a fourth grader ? We may have found our replacement Sierra , 22-year-old female . I think you might be interested in this one . Let me guess . Little bit hot ? Mental health case . Paranoid schizophrenic . Cool . Vivid auditory hallucinations , paranoid delusions . She 's all over the place , usually incoherent . We 've been working with a specialist in neuroleptics , and he 's in there right now . He 's been giving her daily treatments , but none seem to take , poor thing . I think she 'll be sedated enough for evaluations . - Thanks again , Dr. Kinnard . - Certainly . This way . Priya ? Priya , this is Dr. Brink . He 's going to ask you a few questions . No . No , no . Stream of bodies . Just more and more bodies . More bodies . More and more bodies gushing through the river . Just more and more bodies . Priya , my name is Topher Brink . No . How can he get answers when everyone here is a liar ? Everyone is a liar . Everyone 's a liar . He 's a liar . - He 's a liar . - I 'm not a liar . He 's a liar . He 's a liar . He 's a liar . I 'm not a liar . - Priya ... - Don 't call me that . They 're dissolving me from the inside out . Do you know where you are ? I 'm in hell . You 're in Los Angeles . I can understand the mix-up . You 're in a medical facility . - No , no . - Would you like to leave this place ? Yes . Yes . Help me . Help me , please . ( SHOOING ) PRIYA : There were men with guns , and they took me here , filled me with poison . They 're filling me with poison to make me crazy . It 's not uncommon to believe that . They 're torturing me . They 're torturing ... ( WHISPERING ) They 're torturing me . I 'm a prisoner . I 'm a prisoner . - I 'm a prisoner . - Not for long . ( DRONES PLAYING ) Sun rises slow Water rides the air Gathering in the clouds Forming raindrops or heavy snow We 're drones , happy as we are Thinking our sustain lies in love The flow tearing us apart You 're here to stay ? I have you to myself ? I 'm all yours . - Is it done , then ? - Yes . Good . If you say so . If you have actually managed to develop some pangs of conscience , you may rest in the knowledge that in this matter , you had no choice . No . I didn 't . Will it still be romantic if we build up an appetite first ? Am I being too aggressive ? ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Did you want me wide-eyed and demure ? Or stupid ? Did you want me to be a mute ? ( SIERRA LAUGHING ) Which is it , Nolan ? Which fantasy did you want to keep forever ? Priya ? You just couldn 't take no for an answer . BOYD : Are you looking for this ? Is this a bookmark ? It 's a leaf . And it 's pretty . Is the book pretty ? There aren 't any pictures . I can make out some of the words . It 's fun . Exercising our brains makes us our best . Echo , when did you learn how to lie ? - Am I in trouble ? - Not from me . But there are people who would be very upset if they knew what you were doing . Reading ? You brought the painting to Topher . You 're pushing the Actives , the staff . What you 're doing could have consequences you can 't predict or control . Some people are not ready to wake up . I don 't care . Something bad is coming , like a storm , and I want everyone to survive it . They need to wake up . Echo , you stir things up , you might bring the storm on yourself . I 'm not your lab rat anymore , Nolan . I 'm free , clear-headed . It feels good . What ? And you came to get revenge for a year of loving every minute of it ? ( SCOFFS ) Did I love it ? Must not have been very memorable . I remember you poisoning me , locking me up , but I have not a single memory of the year where I apparently liked you . Oh , we ... We had some good times . I got filled in on all the details . Brainwashing . Talk about desperate . You know , they even programmed me to think it was endearing how quick you were . - You were mine . - I 'm sorry . I don 't think I was faithful to you . Yeah . I let them whore you out to anyone . No . It 's something else . It 's someone I trust . - He helps me . He thrills me . - See ? No , see , it worked . Yeah , you told me that you loved me 100 times . - I changed you . - No . It 's not you . ( LAUGHS ) - I managed to fall for someone else . - You think this is cute ? It 's absurd . I don 't remember meeting him or even spending a moment with him , but I can feel it stronger than anything . ( GASPS ) I 'm crazy about him . I love him . I love him so much more than I hate you . Are you gonna fight fair this time ? ( SCREAMING ) No . So much for fair , huh ? You know , this is a scenario I never thought of . You resisting . Struggle is a turn-on . I will kill you . ( EXHALING ) All right . Okay . Priya ? Priya ? Priya ? Priya ? Priya ? Priya . Priya . Priya . We gotta run . We gotta run . We gotta ... We gotta get out of here . We gotta run before somebody ... ( SHUSHES ) ( SIGHS ) - How did you ... - I 'm head of security . I hear every call . Priya , I want you to wash your hands and go to Nolan 's room . Pack a suitcase of his clothes . Pack for warm weather . - Topher . - Yeah ? In the van outside , you 'll find containers of sulfuric acid , a plastic sheet and a bag of tools . What ? What are you talking about ? Consequences . - Come on , Topher . - Boyd , I can 't do it . You 're a doctor . You know how to dissect a body . That was in school . And why do you ? Slit the femoral arteries and pump the chest . Draining the fluids makes it easier to cut up . ( COUGHING ) ( GASPS ) ( GAGGING ) I was just trying to help her . Now she 's ruined . You had a moral dilemma , your first , and it didn 't go well . Priya does not belong in the Dollhouse . BOYD : She does now . Now I have to start the lies . Hey , man . It 's me . Yeah . It 's been a while . Look , I 'm gonna need the Goose . Is he around ? Yeah . I need someone disappeared . BOYD : It seems his permanent engagement plan involved leaving the country with Sierra . Did any heat come down from up top ? Not that I know of . Anything at your end ? Nothing here . But he left without her , in a hurry . We found his car just south of the border with some fake ident in the glove box . So Sierra 's back in the house ? Never even got to say goodbye . How convenient . Are you going to look into it further ? I don 't think any good would come of it . SIERRA : I don 't know what 's real . I ... Yesterday , I had lost my mind , trapped in a nightmare . Then you bring me here , wake me up , and I 'm sane again . But you tell me it 's been a year . All the things I was made to do . And I kill a man . I woke up from a nightmare only to live in one . You were supposed to help me . I thought I was . I was fooled . I 'm so sorry . If there was anything I could do to make it better ... Do you have any beer ? ( EXHALING ) Am I allowed to have beer in here ? ( SNIFFLING ) Or is this my last one ? No , you 're allowed on special occasions . And are we happy here ? I ... You ... Most of you ... I have no idea . That 's him . ( SIGHING ) What 's his name ? Victor . I love him . Is that real ? Yes . Yes , it 's real . He loves you back . ( SIGHING ) I wished Nolan dead . I did . I thought about it all the time when I was locked up in that horrible place going crazy . I never should 've let you go there . I should 've just set you free . I would 've gone anyway . I wanted to confront him . I don 't know what I thought would happen . If you wake me up again , put me back to where I was a year ago . Skip this day . Ignore it , or delete it , or whatever . I don 't ever want this back , okay ? Okay . SIERRA : This secret we have , can you keep it ? I can keep it , but I don 't know if I can live with it . I know I can 't , but I don 't have to . ( SIGHING ) ( TRA VELLING WOMAN PLAYING ) Hang on , traveling woman Don 't sacrifice your plan Did I fall asleep ? For a little while . Got to listen To the vision Some may say a dream Words from the unseen Or it can make you tired , tell you lies And make you fall Make you tired , tell you lies and make you fall Make you tired , tell you lies and make you fall English - SDH - US Ripped by stlc8tr

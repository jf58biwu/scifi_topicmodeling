It 's weird , but- - It 's what I want . You know I 'm here for you , right ? If you need anything at all , anything . I know . Oh , nice ! Oh , go , come on . Don 't let me stop you .

" Every child born in this world is finer than the last . " Good old Dick . Not great for the siblings , but whatever you want . Siblings ? Oh ! Let me have this one . Okay . I hope that Chris is okay with this . He 'll be fine . He almost died with mom and dad . He only just needs a little time . It 's been a tough year . You know , my parents , they would have loved you . I 'm almost done here . Alright . Okay , Can I use your shower ? Of course you can . It 's our shower now . I love you . I love you . Go on . Frank ! Breathe , just breathe . That 's right . Breathe , baby . Okay , okay . Honey , you remember the first night we met ? Yeah . Every second . You must 've walked by my table like five times . I was at Lancaster Hall . All the girls were hitting on you . Coz you 're the big shot architect . And then- - You need to wait out here . Can I be with her ? No . No , not yet , Frank . Is there a problem ? It appears the fetus has had a growth spurt since our last checkup . Is that unusual ? In the last ultrasound , everything looked okay . But since then , the baby 's doubled in size . We 're six months in . No , I know , I know . I-I don 't know what happened . But Lenore 's body is sending a definite message . That baby wants out . Unfortunately , it 's not gonna be an easy one , Frank . We 're prepping Lenore for a C-section now . She 's gonna be okay ? No , she 's gonna be fine . So don 't worry . She 'll be fine . Okay . How are you feeling , Lenore ? Mm , weak . Good . That 's the medication I gave you to stop the contractions . So don 't worry . You 're supposed to feel relaxed . Leonore , the anesthesiologist is gonna prep you now , and then we 'll count you down , okay ? Okay . I 'm gonna start you IV . You 're gonna feel a little stick . Thank you . Starting to feel like you 're floating ? We 're gonna count you down now , okay ? In ten , nine , eight , seven . You 're gonna be okay . There 's something wrong with the baby . Six , There 's nothing wrong with the baby , Leonore . Six , five , four , three , Stop . [ whispers ] Stop . Scalpel . We ready ? Let 's get that baby out . Here it comes . He 's big . Yeah , he is big . Seems okay . Clamping . What the hell ? Baby . Honey . Are you okay ? Are you okay , baby ? Oh , man , look at you . Is everything all right ? We have to take her back into surgery , but the baby 's fine . What happened ? He 'll be okay . We just have to clean him up . My baby . Did you see him ? You okay ? It 's okay . Is she all right ? Can I come ? Stay here . Nobody saw anybody come in or out of that room , right ? We 're searching the video tapes . Everything seems normal . That 's bad as far from normal as you can get . Come one . Come on , this way . And then I woke up here . That 's it . Was there anyone unusual about anyone in that room that shouldn 't have been there ? Look , she was completely doped up , Sergent . You know , she can 't help you . I just wanna take my baby home now . Fair enough . If you don 't mind , in a few days I 'm gonna ask you to speak to a psychologist who works for our department . Psychologist ? Why ? Cause he 's real good at getting witnesses to remember events of a crime . We really appreciate it . If you don 't mind . Larkspur residents are in a state of shock today with the events at County Hospital . Two doctors and two nurses were brutally murdered in the operating room while performing a cesarean section birth . Although Police spokesman had little to say on the subject , KBLS Radio has learned that they 're at a loss to find a motive . No suspect has been identified . Hey Come meet your nephew , buddy . He 's huge . Yeah . What 's his name ? Ah , Daniel . Hey What do you think ? Yeah , that works . Danny Boy . Ain 't he great ? You like him ? Think he 's something . Yeah . Hey there Danny Boy . Lenore Harker . Early twenties . Comes form a military family . Both her parents are stationed overseas . But not her . Graduate school . 19th century French poets . No record of any kind . Seems traumatized by it . Blocked it all . I told her you were gonna be talking to her . Well , the sooner the better . I 'm gonna put up hope . Buy the garage and gonna go fishing at the lake . We 'll go dirt biking but don 't tell your mom . Hi . Hey honey . Saw your daddy ! Yeah , we 're making plans . You saw your daddy ! Baby 's wrapped too tight . No , he 's fine . No , it 's too tight . All the books say that he should be a little looser . He 's okay . Frank . He scratched me . We 're gonna have to cut his nails . Oh , no , baby , now he 's scared I 'm sorry . Here you go . Go to your mommy . You 're huge . He 's probably just hungry . You 're gonna check on Chris while I feed him ? Yeah . Oh , that 's a man . That 's a hungry man . Yes , it is . That 's a hungry man . Yes , it is . Len , have you been here all night ? Frank , your son is totally amazing . Of course he is . He 's a Davis . No , you don 't understand . He rolled over . Ele não deveria fazer isso antes do quarto mês . They 're not supposed to do that for four months . And he lifted his head . He 's so strong . He 's special . He 's a special baby . He 's a little bruiser . Shit . Good boy . Shh . Shh , Baby , shh . Shh . Okay . I know you didn 't mean it . I know you didn 't mean it . Honey , we got us a little company in the bathroom . So ... So , I need those traps . I can call pest control . No , no , no , I just that--It 's fine . I can 't poison , because if I poison it , it dies , it smells , it 's not good . So , I need the traps . I don 't know where the darn things are . I do , it 's gotta be here . Are you gonna go to the office today ? Yeah . That 's uh- - You 're probably right . I just like being here at home with you guys . It 's okay , Frank . You don 't have to be by my side every minute . Actually , I 'm feeling much better . Guys , I 'm gonna go . Come on . Gotta chill out , seriously . This isn 't like her , I 'm telling you . This isn 't like you . Stressing yourself out . Come on , it 's okay . I hear from her every day for five years , now nothing . Something 's wrong . It 's fine . Okay . Alright . That 's one up . Come on , guys , let 's go ! Come on Doug . The time , man . Time . Come on . Listen . Whoa , whoa , whoa . You got six hours to lay that foundation . So get it round the back . Be quick . Come on . You 're in trouble . Sorry . I didn 't mean to scare you . What do you mean I 'm in trouble ? Haven 't you heard ? There 's a killer on the loose . The teachers are yelling at anyone who steps off the playground . Well then , you 're in trouble too . Yeah . If they catch me . I 'm Nicole . Just transferred in this week . I 'm Chris . Chris Davis ? Well , yeah . You 're famous . Your nephew was born during the murders . Did you see him at the hospital ? No . No . Gotta run . Hey . Leave it alone . Hey ! Don 't do that . What are you doing ? You scared me . He 's sleeping , honey . Let 's not wake him up . Okay . I 'm sorry . Don 't eat too much . Good morning , Mr. Davis . Sorry to intrude . Sergeant Perkins ? I 've been trying to getin touch with you for a few days , Lenore . I figured you must be occupied . Yeah . Yeah , you know . We really need Lenore to come in and talk to the psychologist I talked to you about . If you don 't mind . Now ? We just woke up . I 'm really sorry . But we need you to do this while the events are still fresh in your mind . You see , we have no real leads at the moment . It 's vital we do this right away . Well , you know , if it is that important . We can 't really bring a newborn into a Police station . I brought Officer Marcos . She 's gonna watch the baby while we 're gone . It 's really not optional . Hey , Marnie . I have your mail . Thanks . And there 's something for Lenore . Can you recall anything from the time you were taken into the delivery room ? I remember , uh , the doctor said that it 'd be over in a few minutes . And , uh the nurse put something in my IV . And then , uh , I was out . And I woke up in my room . Okay . Um , What about the , the other medical technicians ? Is there anything about them ? The nurse ... . ... she was very pretty . I could tell that through her mask . Alright ... . What about sounds ? Do you have any memories of things people were saying ? I heard , uh ... There 's something wrong with the baby . You 're gonna be okay . There 's nothing wrong with the baby Lenore It 's coming . Stop . Stop . Look , um . I really- - I really can 't do this now . I 've told you everything I remember . Oh Lenore , come on , we 're just getting there . Come on . I really- - I-I have to go . Thank you . Have a great day . Daniel ? Daniel ? Daniel ? No ! Do not eat that . Do not ever , ever , ever eat this ! Please don 't do this . Hey . It 's me again . I haven 't heard from you still . And I 'm starting to get really worried now . What 's her name said , You haven 't been in touch with any of your professors since the baby was born . What 's going on , Len ? And now I have this letter from the Dean threatening to withdraw your thesis proposal . This is exactly what I was afraid would happen . You 'd forfeit the semester . If you need help , I 'm here . Please , call me . Okay , I love you . Bye . Hi . No . My , my two angels . Godd morning . Hi . You know , I 've been thinking . Now that we have Daniel , well , maybe we should consider getting uh , getting him up . You know , we should- - Things are so complicated right now . We should at least talk about it . You know , at least go off to dinner with me like I asked , tonight . You could , uh , you could get all dressed up like you used to . We have the baby . We can get a sitter . Hey . Okay . Okay ? Great . Great , It 'll be fun . I promise . I swear . I gotta shower . Hello . I 'm really sorry to disturb you , Lenore , but I need to speak with you . Look , I-I told you everything I know . Please . It won 't take long . Okay , I 'll give you five minutes . You were very upset the other day . Well , um , I have a newborn . I 'm slightly emotional . I specialize in treating witnesses of traumatic events . I know the signs . You were recalling something . Okay , I don 't think you 're listening . I want you to come in to be hypnotized . Absolutely not . I think it would help you . I don 't need any help . I 'm perfectly fine . I really can 't be more clear about that . You don 't look fine . Okay , you need to go . Like now . Oh , no . It 's okay . Is it my birthday ? So , what do you think ? It 's amazing . I don 't know , I just thought it 'd be nice to have a real meal with real napkins and not paper towels . The baby is asleep , so I don 't know , I thought I 'd pay attention to the other man in my life . What do you think ? It 's amazing . Yeah . Okay . Okay , let 's eat . You 've reached the office of Dr. Baldwin . Please leave a message after the beep . The hell is going on ? Dispatch . Janey , I 'm trying to reach Dr. Baldwin all morning . He was supposed to have a meeting with Dr. Devale . He never showed . Did he call in ? No , he didn 't . Look , do me a favor . Call his office . Have him check his calendar . Find out what his last appointments were . You get back to me when you get them . You got it . Honey , that was great . Really . I 'm glad . Um , I gotta do some homework if that 's okay . Yeah , it 's fine . Just let us know if you need any help . Uh , no , I think I 'll be fine , thanks . Okay , bye . I 'm sorry I 've been so , um- - That 's okay . It 's been a rough couple of weeks . They say it always is with your first . Okay . They don 't know the half of it . Uh , I 'm gonna go say goodnight to Danny Boy . I don 't get it . What ? How can something so incredibly beautiful have come from us ? We 're very lucky . I mean , he really does look like an angel . Something from another world . I know . Are we good ? Yeah , were good .

Let 's just go in the kitchen for a minute . Okay . Why haven 't you answered any of my calls ? I don 't know . This whole motherhood thing is , uh , it 's an adjustment . You know , at some point you 're gonna have to come back to school . Or they 're gonna take away your scholarship . I don 't think I 'm gonna go back to school , Marnie . Not now . I knew it . I knew it . As soon as you decided to keep this baby , that was it . You gave up . I have responsibilities . You have a responsibility to yourself . This is exactly why you wanted to terminate in the first place . Remember ? Because of this . Why would you say that ? What is wrong with you ? Len ! I 'm sorry . Okay ? Yeah , okay , fine . I shouldn 't have brought that up . Look at you . You 're a mess . Look , I have my baby now . And , uh , that 's everything . You can do such great things .. I am doing great things . I 'm raising my child . You don 't understand- - I understand . I understand that you 're throwing your life away . Right . Okay , great . Right . Well , it 's my life .

Marnie and I found this website on line ... and it had these pills ... and , um- - Did you find something ? Take a look at this . It 's fine . I think it 's gonna be fine . We just need to write after them . Or you can give them a call tomorrow morning . Uh , and that 'll be it . You just need to take like six tablets . Okay ? They gave you like a natural miscarriage . It 's okay honey . It 's for the best . You 've got your whole life ahead of you . Your whole life . I got so sick . I thought I was gonna die . Hey , hey , hey . Get it out . Come on . I immediately regretted it . Then I just kept thinking , " Please , God , don 't let my baby die . Please , God , let my baby live , please. please. please . " Please , don 't let my baby die .. And then I was better and It was fine . It was alive . It was a miracle . I just hope there 's nothing wrong with Daniel . Oh , no , he 's perfect . Love you . so much . Sergeant Perkins , come in .

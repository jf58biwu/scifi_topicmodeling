 Destiny . The design is clearly ancient , Launched hundreds of thousands of years ago . Where the hell are we ? Several billion light years from home . We are on a ship , but we have no idea where we are In relation to earth . This ship could be the most important discovery Mankind has made since the stargate itself . These are the wrong people , In the wrong place . We 've got a lot of wounded . We need to get home . We barely have enough power To operate the main systems . This ship simply doesn 't have the capability to dial earth . Yeah , I read about these chinese miners That survived a cave-in for six days By drinking their urine . I 'm going to go ahead and pretend I didn 't hear that . Yeah . You know what they ate ? Coal . Coal ? Yeah. it 's a true story . I mean , don 't get me wrong , it was pretty stupid . Almost killed them . Water level 's down again . You 're sure nobody went near that compartment on your watch ? Spencer came by and asked If he could have a look in the tank . Why ? He 's a crazy person . Sir . Anyway , I said no . Nobody goes in there without my authorization . Sir . Maybe it evaporated When we went through the star . It 's a closed system . All that water went somewhere . We 're down to half of what we had when we got here . I don 't understand this . You 're the one trying to get The recycling system up and running . Maybe there 's a leak somewhere . Ship says it 's fine . If what you 're saying is accurate- - It is . Then we 've got a serious problem . Well , we wouldn 't If you did what I asked you to do in the first place- - Oh , please , can we stick to one problem at a time ? Running out of water wouldn 't matter If we just dial earth and go home . I already explained that to you . The ship 's recharged. the power reserves are full . That 's the point , they 're not ! Well , where are we at , then , rush ? Probably about less than 40 % of original design capacity . You think I can 't tell When someone just pulls a number out of his ass ? What ? Uh , I actually pulled that number Out of my ass . He 's not making it up . Look , if destiny was ever capable Of dialing back to earth , It was thousands of years ago , When the ancients originally intended To come here . But not now . Well , then , you 're right . We have a problem . Yes- - Again . Okay , Eli ... Get brody in on this . He 's an engineer . I need to borrow Eli . 40,000 liters ? That 's what I heard . Well , we didn 't drink it . Let 's just say it wouldn 't surprise me If there was more water than they 're telling us . So , what , they 're hoarding it ? It 's a big ship . You know the military . Long as they control the water supply , They control us . That 's right , I 'm talking about you . Those two are harmless . Keep it up . I need to know who I can trust . I feel like a spy . Eli ... Clean this room up . Right . What is it ? Nothing , sir . Just had a strange feeling . Well , we just dropped out of FTL . Wasn 't that . I 'm on my way to the gate room . There 's a planet in range . Come on . What have we got ? There 's only one planet in range . The ship 's already dialed it up . We 're getting readings now . Whoa ... Looks like we entered the hoth system . Empire strikes back . The second star wars movie . Okay , I refuse to call it episode v. Minus 47 degrees celsius . Bundle up . Is that water ice ? Yes , but the atmosphere Is dangerously thin . And poisonous . .13 % molecular oxygen , 95 % carbon dioxide , with a hint of argon . Ooh , nasty planet . The only candidate within range . We 're going to have to use the spacesuits we found , But if that brings back a half a ton of ice , I 'll take it . Shut it down for now . Lieutenant Scott , come in , please . Scott ? There a reason your radio 's off ? Come in . Colonel young is looking for you . Uh , I think i 'd better- - Go , go . What , you couldn 't find a broom closet ? We 're still working on the other suits . We 're close to having a third one ready . How close ? A day , maybe ? We 'll be back in FTL by then . Well , they 're not in great shape . All these years , there 's bound to be degradation . Well , keep at it , we 're going to need them . Looks like it 's just you and me , then . I could take kennair , sir . She 's done eva 's before , And you 're- - I 'm fine . How are we going to cut the ice ? Plasma cutter . Should cut through the ice like butter . Just don 't get the business end Anywhere near you . Uh , suit radios are voice-activated Between you . Press here if you want to tie into The ship 's communication systems . T.j ... You 're in command while we 're gone . Is everybody clear on that ? Oh , I 'm sure we 'll manage . Riley ... Start dialing . Assuming a fair amount of physical activity , You have just over eight hours of air . It 's what , 11 hours until the next jump to FTL , Right ? Don 't worry . You 'll run out of air long before we leave you behind . Thanks . Beautiful , huh ? One deep breath , and you 're dead . Destiny , this is young. come in . Yes , sir , we hear you five by five . I 've just tested the ice by the stargate . I read concentrations of ammonia And several other toxic chemicals . How high are the readings ? Off the charts . Well , you could try looking farther afield . Maybe on the other side of that lake . Is that really a good idea , sir ? The further away from the gate we go , The less ice we can bring back . Oh , i 've got just the thing . Give me two minutes . Colonel , give us five . Eli has an idea . Uh , maybe there 's fresh water in the lake under the ice . At minus 47 , The ice will be 10 feet deep . We 're better off finding a pressure ridge , Something we can mine . Sounds like you 've done something like this before . Oh , yeah . A million times . Whoa , did you feel that ? It 's just a tremor . Hey , you know , the last planet I was on exploded . Destiny , this is young . We 're burning through suit air . What 's going on with this bright idea ? Here we come , people ! Here we come ! Sorry , it 's impossible to steer by remote . That 's fantastic , Eli . What made you come up with that ? A-actually , it represents my most recent attempt to fly , But it should carry a ton of ice . Colonel , we 're sending through Eli 's latest invention . I love it ! The man gets a gold star . How much will it hold ? Definitely more than you can carry by yourself . All right , we 're heading out . Keep the gate active . We 'll radio back when we find something . T.j ... Sir ? Listen , if we don 't make it back- - You will . Well , we 're two guys in million-year-old space suits Walking around alone on an ice planet . If we don 't make it back ... You 're going to do fine . Yes , Sir . Good luck . The level 's dropped . Again ? Nobody 's been in or out . Well , brody said there 's no leak in the system , So that leaves one alternative . Who could steal that much ? That 's a lot of water . Yeah , I know , but I don 't know what else to do . Besides , it wouldn 't hurt to know where we stand . Start a search . Let 's go , gorman . Dial it up again , mr. riley . We must maintain communication . It just went off a second ago . Your timing is perfect ! Because it 's been 38 minutes , The maximum time a stargate can remain open . Well , see , I didn 't know that . Colonel young , it 's dr. rush . What 's your status ? We 've found an exposed area of ice That looks promising . Testing now . We 're pretty far out . Can 't see the gate anymore . It 's still worthless . Keep looking . Lieutenant johansen . Go ahead . I found something . So did i. can it wait ? It 's spencer . I can deal with him myself if you 'd like , but- - No , it 's fine. i 'll be on my way . I didn 't steal anything ! Yeah ? what 's this , huh ? Those are mine ! I brought them through with me When we evacuated ! You brought them through with you , huh ? Give me a reason . Hey , hey , hey ! back off ! I don 't have time for this ! Lock him up somewhere . The colonel can deal with him when he gets back . You said you found something . To be honest , I don 't know what I saw . I have to talk to rush . You keep searching . Nothing we find Is going to add up to what 's missing . I know , But we have to know what we 've got . No one 's gone near the tank , and it keeps going down . Come on , come on ... Destiny ... This is young . We got pure ice . That 's excellent news . It 's a frozen waterfall . We should be able to break it up Into manageable pieces and haul it back . We 'll be ready for you . Busy day on destiny . I haven 't taken anything . I don 't think you have . What are you doing ? Checking for stolen rations . It 's okay , dr. franklin . Confess , miss armstrong . You drank 40,000 liters of water . He 's kidding . I know . I 'm just saying , we have rights . I 'm done here , miss armstrong . I hope I haven 't inconvenienced you . I understand . I knew that you would . You . Next . This is never going to be enough . Stand back . You 've done this before , too , have you ? At least five times . You mind if I give it a shot ? Remember , all we have Are the bullets we brought with us . So , are we talking about , like , one little cloud of bugs , Or are they all over the ship ? I 'm not even sure that " bugs " Is the right word for them . Huh , what about " cloud ? " Except the cloud was alive . It was almost like thousands of tiny ... Alien creatures . Yeah , I have a problem with everything you just said . What you 've just described is ... Well , it 's the same as Lieutenant Scott claimed he saw On the desert planet . That 's what I was thinking , And maybe some of them followed him back here . Wouldn 't we have noticed them ? No , not if Only a few came through the gate . They 're like tiny grains of sand . And then what , started reproducing ? Well , if it 's a living organism , then yeah , they would . Okay , so now we 've got aliens . What if they start bursting out of our stomachs ? I don 't think they 're dangerous . It almost felt like they were trying to communicate . Lieutenant Scott used the same word . Yeah , at the time , you said he was delirious . Well , I was wrong . What do you intend to do ? Well , I guess we should stop everyone From wandering around the ship . After you . Um ... here ? Yeah , yeah . This is Lieutenant johansen . We have a situation . It 's under control , But as a precaution , I ask everyone to return to their quarters And remain there until further notice . Thank you . You 're , uh ... You 're not going to tell them ? That we 've got aliens ? No , we 'll keep it on a need-to-know basis . What else ? You 're in charge . And I 'm asking your advice . What else ? Always consider the greater good . That 's it . That 's enough ice for now . Let 's get out of here . Gorman , meet me in the gate room . We have ice on the way . Copy . They 're on it . Dial it back , please . Destiny , this is young . How 's it going up there ? Offloading the sled now . Well , hurry it up . We want to do one more run . Just so you know , uh , another matter has come up . We have it under control . We have aliens on the ship . What ? They just shredded gorman . What the hell does that mean ? Millions of tiny flying razor blades Floating around the ship like piranha . Corporal gorman is alive . Uh , Lieutenant johansen is tending to him now . He 's probably not going to make it . Eli ! That 's it. we 're coming back . No , no , no , that 's not necessary , colonel . Eli is overreacting . We believe the creatures are the same As those Lieutenant Scott encountered On the desert planet . They must have followed us back through the gate . No , I doubt those things I saw were dangerous , sir . They ... They helped me . Corporal gorman may have provoked them . We 'll know more once he comes to . If he comes to . In the meantime , Lieutenant johansen Has ordered everyone to remain in their quarters . They 're nothing more than a nuisance At this point , colonel , But we desperately need more ice . All right . We 'll figure out what to do with them When we get back . Okay , sending the sled back through now . Rush out . You 're going to have to learn when to shut up . You can 't just- - You can 't just lie to the guy and expect me to- - Once back into FTL , It could be days before we find another planet Capable of replenishing our water supplies . This ice represents a fraction of what we need To stay alive . We need more ! Yeah , I know ! But that doesn 't mean that you can- - Yes , it does ! You 're making it sound like we 're- - Just stop acting like a child , please ! We have to figure this out . I said " we . " I say we torch ' em . You know , put some teams together , Hunt them down . Where 'd you get that ? I can invent things too . Hey , we 've really got to work together on this project- - You know , maybe the bugs were just responding Out of self-defense . Self-defense ? Did you see what they did to gorman 's face ? Yeah , I 'm the one treating him , sergeant . I saw exactly what they did to his face . Look , we don 't know what it is we 're dealing with , And " torching " them May only serve to antagonize them further . We hit them with something else . Oh , revenge , that 's great . We-we got to do something . If we just sit around Till they drink all of our water , Then we 're going to ... Alien bugs show up and half our water disappears . Don 't tell me I 'm the only one who made this connection . Well , obviously not . The question is , what are we going to do about it ? Okay , sergeant , you and your go team Go search for this alien ... Entity , cloud , bugs , whatever it is we 're calling them , And report back , okay ? Yes , ma 'am . And sergeant ? no torching . Yes , ma 'am ! Ooh , I have an idea ! It 's going to be dark soon . Okay , stand back . Nothing 's happening . Oh ... Yes , there is . It 's like vapor . We just can 't see them . That 's what they did when I first saw them . It 's like they just disappear . So they 're growing in numbers exponentially , And consuming our resources Without us even knowing it . You have to get them off the ship . Sergeant greer , come in . I 'm a little busy right now . The bugs are getting into the water tank Every time we open the hatch . Once we locate the main swarm , We 're going to have to find- - They 're in front of me right now . Don 't antagonize them . I won 't , Unless they antagonize me first . Do they move when you do ? They do now . What we need is an airlock . Unfortunately , there are none In the habitable compartments Of the ship . I know what to do . This isn 't going to keep us going very long . Maybe destiny will figure out We 're getting short on water And find us a planet with nice fresh water Right next to the stargate . I mean , come on , we deserve a break . Scott ! Scott , can you hear me ? Sorry , sir , the ice just gave way . Are you hurt ? Negative . I 'm okay , but ... I 'm wedged in pretty good . Good thing , too . Looks like a long way down . All right , just hold on . I 'm going to ... I 'm going to throw a line down . Here it comes . I need you to tell me when you 've got it . Got it . Now , if you can manage it , Run it under both your arms And fasten it across your chest . Done this before , too , have you ? Oh , yeah . At least a dozen times . Okay . Now , I want you to pull yourself up . I 'm going to pull from this end . You ready ? Uh , yeah . Okay , one ... Two ... Three ! Pull ! Pull , Scott ! Come on ! Pull ! pull ! How stuck are you ? Pretty dang stuck . Is there any way you can dig yourself out ? I 'm not sure . That 's okay . That 's passed . Scott ? Still here , sir . All right , let 's just , uh ... Let 's think about this for a second . Destiny , this is young . Go ahead . We 've got a situation here . There was a tremor , And Scott fell through the snow into a crevasse . He 's fine , but he 's just out of reach . I tried to pull him up , But that 's not going to happen anytime soon . How 's that other space suit coming ? We stopped work on that . I confined everyone to quarters . All right , it was just a thought . We 'll , uh ... We 'll figure it out . How 's your bug situation ? Same as before. don 't worry about it . Don 't you worry either , t.j. I 'll be out of here in no time . Good luck. johansen out . Everyone is lying . Yeah , grown-ups do that sometimes . This is greer. it 's working . They 're moving away from us as we move forward . Good job . Keep it up . How about you lower the gun down , And I shoot myself free ? Yeah , that 's good thinking . There 's no way the bullets will ricochet into your ass . Well , maybe I can cut my way out With the plasma cutter . You get one hole in that suit , You 're dead . Maybe there 's a way for me to get down there . No , that 's just as stupid . " that 's just as stupid , sir . " The last thing we need Is for both of us to be stuck down here . You okay ? Uh , closed in a little tighter , But I think- - What ? What ? I think I 'm losing suit pressure . I thought we were supposed to be confined to quarters . Yeah , well , I heard over the radio ... There was a tremor . Lieutenant Scott fell into a crevasse . Oh , my God . He 's okay . Just ... stuck . Do they have enough air ? Colonel young says he 's got it under control . I just ... Thought you would want to know . Thanks . Yeah . I think the ice tore a hole in his suit . How big a tear is it ? I can 't-i can 't see it , But I can hear it . It 's-it 's hissing out pretty good . An hour at most . Plenty of time to make it back . Yeah , if I wasn 't stuck ! Colonel , you have to consider The amount of time you have left now . I 'm aware of the damn time , rush . All I 'm saying is if you delay much longer- - Listen to me ! I know exactly what you 're saying , And I 'm not going anywhere without Lieutenant Scott , And that 's the way it 's going to be ! What is the matter with you ? Miss armstrong , You should return to your quarters . No , you know where you can go ? Look , colonel , I understand your desire to rescue Lieutenant Scott , Of course , And only you can decide How much time you have left , But Lieutenant , If colonel young remains there , Trying to free you , To pull you up by himself , There 's a chance he might not make it back . He 's right . Just keep the gate active . We 're going to make it back in time With your damn ice , Which is all you really care about . Colonel- - Young out ! Damn , he 's a lot of work . This is greer . I locked them up . Closing off the ventilation in that room . Okay , vents are closed . Should be airtight . What are they doing now ? Looking for a way out . Come on ! Come on ... Sir ... Colonel ? I 'm thinking . Go . It 's okay . No , it 's not . Come on , sir . We both know you 've done this before , too . Done what ? Lost people . Too many times . I 'm not ... I 'm not doing it again . I-i can 't let you do it . You don 't have a choice . Not that I 'm counting , But this is the third time in almost as many weeks That you 've been willing to kill yourself , and there 's ... There 's a pretty good chance At this point I won 't be around to talk you out of it again . You 're a fine young officer . You 've got a heart As big as a house , And I 'm not here because I want to die . I 'm here because I haven 't given up On saving your ass , So just shut up and think . They 're gettin ' pissed off . Really pissed off . A few of them got out . What ? how ? We need a plan , Lieutenant ! I 'm coming down there ! This is beautiful out here . Scott ... Lieutenant ... Lieutenant ? Scott ... Scott ! Scott ! Scott ! Wake up , Scott ! Lieutenant ! Wake up ! Scott ! I need you to wake up , Scott ! Scott , come on ! Wake up ! Come on ! Lieutenant ! Come on , I got you . That 's it , pull ! Pull , Lieutenant . Come on , Lieutenant . Lieutenant ! Okay , that 's it . Okay , that 's it , I got you . I got you. okay ... Okay ... All right ? You 're okay . Hey ... hey , Scott , come on . Hang on , kid . What 's the plan ? We open the door , They go for the water , we close the lid . All right , who 's going to do that ? I am . No , no , no , I will . I 'm not the one with the torch . No , look , I am not going to let you do that- - I 'm not the one who 's killed any of them , sergeant . You are . I 'll stand back , torch them if they get out . No , I want you out of sight . What , you don 't trust me ? No , I don 't . All right . Eli , I 'm ready . Make us a clear path to the gate room . Seal off everything else . You 're good . If this doesn 't work , Lock this compartment off from the rest of the ship . Destiny , this is young . I 'm on my way back with Scott . Come in . Okay , let ' em out . Okay , I got ' em ! All right , dial the gate . We 're on our way . Destiny ... I 'm almost at the stargate with Scott . Shut it down so I can ... Dial in . Colonel , we 're about to send these alien bugs Through to the planet . We 've no other choice . What ? We need you To step away from the gate And remain as still as possible . They 're coming through now . Get his helmet off . Yeah , I got it . Give her a hand . His pulse is thready , but he 's breathing . Let 's get him out of here . Sergeant spencer , You step out of line again , I will deal with you personally . Understand ? Yes , sir . I don 't think he does . Colonel , I need to talk to you About the behavior of one of your men- - No , that can wait . We need to go over the new rationing amounts Before the next- - Colonel , I was scheduled to use The communication stones this morning ... Colonel ! colonel ! 00 hours ship time , Corporal gorman succumbed to injuries Sustained in an encounter with an alien entity . Lieutenant johansen did everything that she could . I intend to hold appropriate services Tomorrow at 1600 hours . How do I turn it off ?

 Stop ! Stop the bus ! The story of my life is not for the faint of heart . Thanks . it 's all about a girl . Not that girl . Hey . Hi . I don 't think that is a girl . it 's about this girl . Jill Johnson . but she barely knows I exist . man ! I got you a seat down here . What 's . bye . Trey . I 'm so psyched for this class trip . We about to see some real serious cuttingedge shit . Mmm . Mmhmm . Mmm . That 's what I 'm talking about . you got any C batteries on you ? AAs ? Got that new sandwich from Sony in my backpack . WiFi. mmm ! dawg . Look look . Let me show you something . She not even looking at you . If I could just tell her how I feel . I already told you . all right ? man . that crew stuff isn 't real . Rick . man . the Scarface society . .the sexual predators . Yeah . Of course you got the Rick punchers . The who ? they new . Mmhmm . But you know what ? Who cares ? 'Cause we got our own crew . me and you . man . Am I in ? No . baby . The two of us against the world . You hear me ? You look good today . I like your hair . I 'm gonna show you something nasty I downloaded . Don 't tell nobody . Welcome to Amalgamated . head of the research department . man . .where we create the future today . And now I 'd like to show you our crown jewel . The Amalgamated animal genetics lab . Whoa . explore . check this out . All of our animals are genetically engineered and each of them has . you 're so pretty . birdie . Hi . Hi . she is . I 'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper . Our only rules : Don 't feed the animals no flash photography . Some of our genetically engineered animals are a little sensitive to light . It flew away . Uh. whoohoo . loser ? Lance . Leave him alone . I don 't think so . Lance ? Uncle Lou . Mr. Landers ! visionary scientist and C.E.O. of Amalgamated . I 'm just a businessman now . The future of science belongs to all of you . enjoy the tour . Are you okay ? this is healthycough blood . are you ? I am . Ah . Good people . How are they ? They died violently nine years ago . But otherwise okay ? thank you . I live with my aunt and uncle now . you seem like a real chip off the old block . Let 's hope you 're not violently murdered too . That 's for making me look stupid . Next time I hurt you . Lance . Our work with these animals has helped us develop advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone which drives animals to mate called compound H2O0 . It 's a strong sexual attractant . A single drop is enough to arouse any animal . We plan on using it to breed endangered species . A special and indeed often overlooked . Our mostpromising research is with these dragonflies . this dragonfly 's skin armorlike exoskeleton to defend against . And this species of dragonfly has enormous strength for its size . It can lift vast amounts . More than it 's body weight . And here we 've injected the DNA from all three species into seven new geneticallyenhanced super dragonflies . But there 's only six in there . one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns . I lost six tigers alone last month . Ah ! This area is where we keep our livestock . Ohh . Aren 't you going to do something ? Soon as I get this up on YouTube . I understand . Thank you for the call . That was the principal . Rick walked off a class trip . he 's still so troubled . Albert ? Lucille . I have taught him everything I know about being a man . And a good man you are after all these years of marriage . It 's like we first met . you 're a little older . Your hair 's grey . You have crow 's feet . It takes you an hour to pee . Your thighs look like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk . And you 've always had a tiny penis . Well. what does it matter when you 're in love ? Rick . We were wondering where you were . It 's so late . About time you got home .

What 's important is that you 're on the verge of adulthood . Here . take a drink . the rituals of manhood . and tomorrow we 'll circumcise you . Dr. Strom . if you could just wait a few minutes . I 've waited long enough for this egomaniac . We 're the board of directors . Our time is valuable . Mr. Carlson . I have a terminal illness . but the disease has ravaged my organs . I have one hour left to live . It was on sale . allow me to show you the future . Strom . From the. lift it ov . lift it over ! What the hell is that ? An innovation . thank you . that will not only save my life but the life of this company . For too long we 've scraped out profits from pills and injections . The real prize is the total cure . A device that can alter DNA and restore the body to perfect health . You 're crazy . No . dating Paula Abdul . I 'm not crazy . I 'm a visionary ! the machine 's never been fully tested .

I had sex with your mother just like your father did . Huh . You 'll never understand me . Never . That isn 't what your parents wanted for you . What a great performance . did you enjoy the opera ? is something troubling you ? It 's so unfair . They have nothing . Why do we have $ 2 billion ? your grandfather left us $ 3 billion and I made some bad investments . But that 's nothing for you to worry about . But I want to change things . And you will . Five generations of Rikers have worked hard to make this city great . people will look to you to be a hero . will you be ready ? Give me your wallet . That too .

They made her watch three hours of women 's basketball . it was an armed robbery . There was nothing you could 've done . I could 've stopped that guy before he shot my uncle . Then there is blood on your hands . But that 's not important . All that matters is that you 're here for him now . Rick Riker ? Yes ? Dr. Whitby . I 've run some tests . I 'm afraid I have bad news . What is it ? I have an impacted colon . Whew . What a night . Now what brought you here today ? My uncle . Your uncle brought you ? then he shouldn 't be driving . I have to perform a breast exam . please . Is my uncle gonna survive ? I don 't know . We should probably have a look . Hard to say . pretty deep coma . Is he gonna be okay ? I 'll take " dead in a week . " Oh my God ! but this should take the edge off of it . Here we go . Nice and easy . I know . First my parents and now this ?

You look like you putting on a little weight . Ah ! Oh ! about this secret . you see . Xavier ! shit . Well ? You wanna explain why I found her hiding in your closet ? I don 't see nobody . you don 't ? Ow ! Invisible Girl ? Apparently not invisible enough . maybe this wouldn 't have happened . this bitch is crazy . I 'm gonna have to whip your ass . baldy ? sweet cheeks . Whoa ! Ow ! That all you got ? Yeah ! Invisibitch ? whatever . I 'm out of here . I 'm sure gonna miss her . She was crazy in the sack . tongue all over the place . asshole . Spanky . I didn 't even know she had a dog . Still some of the best sex I ever had . How could you do this to me ? To your kids ? To your newborn baby ? How do I know that baby 's even mine ? Because he can do this . Shit ! Ah ! man . Now I 'm never gonna know the secret to becoming a superhero . You wanna know the secret ?

I have a feeling you might disagree with that . do you have my test results ? sir . rejuvenates you . But only for 24 hours . Hmmm . What if I killed 28 people in one session ? Would that give me a month to live ? yes . But only if your cells could absorb and they can 't . I 'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day . Still a slave to the tyranny of time . There must be some answer . There isn 't . Unless . unless you had some cerillium . Then you could create a device powerful enough to draw the lifeforce out of thousands of people and enhance your own cellular capacity . you 're a genius . Wikipedia . But that 's not important . What is important is that you don 't have any cerillium . it 's immoral . We don 't do that sort of thing . We 're a pharmaceutical company . Wait a minute . Take a look . Hawking 's lab is in the physics building . I could just walk right in . You 're going to steal cerillium ? not me . I 'm a law abiding citizen . But perhaps there 's someone inside me . Someone unfettered by the rule of law . survive ! Ow ! glass in my eye . Glass in my eye ! it hurts . if you could spread . spread them with your fingers . Push your lids with your fingers .

This is the chief of police . We have the building surrounded . Come out with your hands up . What the hell is that ? I am the Hourglass . And your time is up . Dragonfly . Hourglass . Dragonfly . It 's just begun ! It 's useless to resist . I 'll fight you to my last breath . Like the sands of time I am unceasing and relentless . Hourglass .

But I just don 't have the time . he 's in over his head . We don 't need socalled superheroes . What Empire City needs is more cops . And a Hooters . Titanium blades . Looks like someone found your weakness . It 's not my weakness . I forgot . Your weakness is you can 't fly . Maybe if you had a partner . I don 't need help . I 'm fine all by myself . doesn 't she ? no . she 's with someone else . maybe that 's for the best . being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly . Aunt Lucille . I love her .

Once a month you 'll bleed from you vagina . I. nothing . Nothing ? I should go . You 're a good friend . check this out . check this out . shit . Let 's go . Get her . it hurts . It hurts . Please stop ! I 'm begging you ! Wait ! Where are you ? Behind you . You saved my life . Do I get to thank you ? Go . Be a hero . Yeah . It looks like you 're planning a mass murder . Would you like help ? Paper clip guy . I 'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us . Lucille . You need support at a time like this . I miss seeing my Albert each morning . 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond . I wish I knew love like that . dear . You just have to follow your heart . That 's the thing . I don 't know if I can . Jill . If you can 't trust yourself who can you trust ? I know . But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone I can 't be with ? It 's not just any guy . It 's the . forget it . You 'll think I 'm crazy . of course not . You can tell me anything . I 'm very good at keeping secrets . but . it 's the Drag . I 'll get it . Thank you . babe .

I hope this isn 't too much of an imposition . of course not . There 's always room for one more . Thank you . It 's just Thanksgiving is for family . Lance is the only family I have . I never married . Fruitcake ? just never met the right woman . Lance told me Rick Riker was your neighbor . Where is Rick ? That 's odd . I thought he was out . I 'll go check on him . you 're busy . Allow me . second door to the right . Rick ? Hmmm . Hmmm . Sorry I 'm late . Mr. Landers . Rick . you 're just on time . take your seat . Ohhh . Ah ah ah ! Not till we say grace . Jesus ! Amen . everyone . Lucille . We have Rick to thank for it . Ever since Albert . Rick has been supporting me with his new job . New job ? You didn 't tell me . I 'm sort of the Dragonfly 's unofficial photographer . What happened to your arm ? Uh . a bike messenger knocked me down . I see your wrist is bandaged . I burned it on some hot coffee . And you have a cut on your lip . Uh . my crackpipe broke . You have a scratch on your neck . I. met a girl on Craigslist . And you have a bruise on your neck . I. met a guy on Craigslist . Lance . We have to go . Why ? I. shat my pants . I 'll drive . Thanks for helping clean up . Of course . Poor thing 's so tired . you know old folks after a big meal . So. you know the Dragonfly ? Uh . I guess . You could sorta say we 're close . Has he . has he ever asked about me ? yeah . once . What did you tell him ? I said . I told him . The thing about Jill is . when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours . you know that you 'd do anything anything to be a better person than you are . So that . you could earn every second of her perfect . and her limitless beauty . and her unending love . Don 't cry . I 'm not . My eyes are burning . I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing anyone 's ever said to me . Scented candle ? Thank you . and yet . I know exactly what I want . Sorry to drop in uninvited . It 's okay . We were hoping someone would open a window . It was getting stuffy in here . So this is the lair of the Dragonfly . I 'm not here to fight you . I 've got thousands of other people I plan to kill . This little visit is just to show you who 'll get hurt if you get in my way . Never ! Time to go . was badly injured . How was she injured ? Badly . What about the Dragonfly ? All I can tell you is this : he didn 't save anyone tonight . how is she ? I 'm afraid your aunt 's taken a turn for the worse . she had no control over her bowels . That 's. that 's awful . I know . I went ahead and set up a MySpace page for her under " crazy shit machine . She already has 40 friends . Wait a minute . That 's somebody else 's aunt . Your aunt has no problem with her bowels . thank God . .because she 's dead . but there is a silver lining . Your uncle came out of his coma this morning . He did ? but you mustn 't tell him about your aunt just yet . He 's in a delicate mental state . The slightest bit of bad news could send him spiraling right back into a coma . I understand . you have a visitor . it 's not your dead wife . It 's your nephew Rick . no bad news . here you go . This is my bill . we confused you we didn 't remove your penis . you won 't be needing them anyway . You just want to keep his spirits up . He 'll land on his feet in no time . We are gathered today to say goodbye to Lucille Adams . Goodbye ! And now the eulogy . It 's tragic to think this is the last time that I can look upon my wife 's face . Lucille ! How could you take her from me ? I can 't live without her ! Ahhh ! Lucille ! Snookie lumps ! there 's been a terrible mistake . This is your wife . Ah ! She is this man 's wife . Give me five minutes . Uncle Albert ! I 'm not finished . You 're one lucky guy . Now . where 's Lucille ? Lucille ! I do have this coupon for a cremation . Rick ? I am so sorry for your loss . What is it ? I realize . we can never be together . I don 't believe you . Rick . I know you do . trust me . I 'm telling you this for your own good . I don 't love you . You 're no longer in my five . How could you ? When I was young I never needed anyone Makin ' love was just for fun Those days are gone All by myself Don 't wanna be All by myself Anymore All by myself Don 't wanna be All by myself . Anymore All by myself Don 't want to be All by myself Anymore All by myself . man . You only beat me by two strokes this time . And the back nine is what killed . Oh my God ! man ? dude . What 's the point ? and we found your costume in the garbage outside . I 'm not the Dragonfly anymore . But you said the Hourglass was going to kill thousands of people . I 've rejected the only girl I 've ever loved and I can 't even fly . I wish I 'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly . And maybe your father shouldn 't have given you this after all . Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring . cheap internet porn . The rest is in Latin . the hero 's path is dangerous . You may fail or you may fly . All that matters is that you do it for the best of reasons . that 's what makes you a real hero . I wouldn 't know where to start . where 's he gonna find thousands of people in one place ? Look .

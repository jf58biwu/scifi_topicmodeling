 previously , on kings ... father 's birthday is days away . days in which a thousand things go wrong unless managed with attention . pay attention , boys . Your father died fighting for this . welcome home , son . this time things will be different , I trust ? we give up what we want when we want power . I can 't be like I was , joseph- - I can 't . but I love you- - when I was a little girl , I was very sick , and the doctors told me I wouldn 't get better . Your daughter takes chances with her life as if it wasn 't hard-won . I owe you the truth . I 'm promised to someone else . I 'm sorry . thank you . happy birthday , sir . a gun from an ally . Now , is that a gift or an invitation to a duel ? a gift . I know better than to rankle a silas with a gun in his hand . thank you . happy birthday , ir . thank you , hanson . all this open access to you , sir- - At least let us prescreen first . I will not take cover every time a threat is made by some quacking loon . you had a death threat made against you this morning . It 's ... the least we can do . well , tre must be a way of doing less , hmm ? Oh , invite more guards if you wish . have you reconsidered inviting andrew ? William was hoping- - my birthday , my list . I will endure a party in the company of my choosing , but with none that sour the wine in my cup . Thank you . I 'm sorry , william . He still says no . we 're running late . We should go . You know , I never much liked parties before , but it might be nice to be royalty again . I honestly never thought that aunt rose would ever associate with me again in public . I was thinkin ' ... Maybe we shouldn 't go . With my schedule- - a night out is a rare thing . Why waste it in the company of so many empty people when you and I can catch up , have dinner together . You still like steak ? I wasn 't invited , was i ? Of course you were ! We 're family . you don 't have to be mad on my account . Most people don 't want me around . You should go . I have my reading to do . plans have changed . Silas 's grand birthday ... Is hereby canceled . ... with local news reporter lucinda wolfson at his side . The wolfson family is renowned for ... jack ! you 're nervous . oh , god . nothing to worry about . When in doubt say ... Thank you and happy birthday . okay . a party fit precisely for a king . and I 'm sure he hates it . oh , he does , but shows appreciation for the effort . And who is this ? you remember lucinda wolfson ? She 's making an honest man of me . well , with a face like that , how could she not ? How long have you two been seeing each other ? thank you . Happy birthday , sir . find us some drinks , would you ? usefully quiet . And a wolfson . She 's a little out of her depth , but we can fix that . Well chosen , jack . happy birthday , sir . used to be you 'd see me and head towards me . I 'm trying to respect your wishes . You 're promised to someone else . What am I supposed to do ? david ... the world doesn 't just stop because we want to be together . we ? You need to go . You should go ahead . all right , everyone . The birthday boy . Come . me ? say something . oh , I hate public speaking . To get old ... It 's a terrible thing . We should do it in reverse so that we can appreciate the strength . The only consolation in the creaks and the limited range of vision is that we don 't endure it alone . all : aw ... so I see- - Well- - well , almost see ... Friends , family , blessings . Oh , there have been days . And this is one of those days I feel that strength . My heart is filled with richly oxygenated blood from experience , and my mind is clear . Good timing . To our city . To our people . May we all grow old together . all : hear , hear ! ah . Happy birthday . on his birthday . the blackout covers the full city through the entire southland . None of our enemies are claiming responsibility . the entire grid shut down . Power , communications , lan and cellular . we asked the world to watch our skies and offered them a display of our humiliation . Cause ? not cause , not source . Eight por plants were over serviced simultaneously , creating a demand spike . and how did you manage to have eight power plants service simultaneously ? uh ... clerical error . mm-hmm . I 'd like to meet this cleric , hmm ? Every minute the lights stay down powers rumors of our impotence and tempts opportunists . Just get the lights on . there 's a switch somewhere . Flip it . it 's like a blanket over the city . Let 's go see . you know what this is ? This is time stopped . This is permission . for what ? for us . This is our chance . Should we take it ? sir ... you should hear this . pfc chris beals , the man issuing your death threats over port prosperity , he was just seen outside altar mansion . Service went after him , but he eluded capture , headed east towards the river . They said they saw him armed . taking advantage of the blackout . the princess , sir , she 's ... Not here . was he following her ? we don 't know . They passed out pictures of him . All are on highest alert . We 'll find her . We have every available man on it . is the power back on ? no . Sir ? then why is there music ? sir ? gath has unveiled a hundred new armored divisions . Calls them " goliaths . " Range doubles hours . They amass at the demilitarized zone . another sneak attack in the plains of down . We have 36 casualties . And more of the wounded just airlifted in . critical and in the balance . if we counter , it will only cause gath 's escalation . We 'll provoke a new war . what news of my daughter ? no updates , sir . As she was an hour ago . an hour ago she was not well . you have run his court since it began , chancellor scholar . You know when his moods are foul ... Dark . You fear as I do . My daughter 's illness has left him unable . he 's hurt badly . We don 't know . He can hear you . Come tell him that you 're here . Let your father know you 're praying . it 's not fair . I know . we weren 't supposed to be fighting anymore . Why did they attack us ? Why did dad have to be there ? come on . Let 's go see him . the anc ? too low . She 's severely anemic . try something else . her blood and bone marrow are overwhelmed . she 's strong . She 'll survive another treatment . sir ... There 's nothing left but to spend time . she 's looking better . In less pain . This treatment 's working . I 'm sorry , sir . It 's not- - no ! She doesn 't lose tonight . Beautiful princess ... Friend to elves and maker of music in the meadow with nothing but her hair . dad , I 'm not five . you 're four . You 're two . Eyes that light up the beltway . You look strong . Look what I ought you . harlow . I thought we were doing the classics . you know the classics better than any professor . we 've read this a hundred times . well , what 's one more time ? " harlow , several dumplings , and the sabbath queen . " mm . right . " she knew she was meant for school , " for book things and pencil time , " and yet and yet , harlow found herself " veering left , not right , " where she knew the schoolhouse still sat , " and with that confidence , she dropped her books and took her first step into the dark . " nothing yet on the princess , ma 'am . we 've posted lookouts all around the city . We 're checking everywhere we know . everyone we have on the street . I want her back here safe now . I 'll coordinate with city police . We 'll pull palace guard and remaing service . everyone ! I 'm talking about a whole house full of guests standing around doing nothing . I want her back safe- - now ! are we allowed to dance ? last time we danced , you didn 't know how . last time we danced , I was very nervous . I was wearing a tux for the first time ... And I thought you hated me . I just didn 't know what to think . People like you aren 't supposed to exist . someone could see . no , they can 't . Not a princess . Just a girl in the dark ... Who can do anything she wants . princess . Princess ! Nope . Not her either . you 're him , right ? mm . You gonna freak out on me ? the lights are down . Be anyone you want . jack . Jack ! Jack ! Jack ! if you 're not here to tell me you found her , get out ! I 'm not leaving you here alone , sir . oh , unless you doubt I know how to use this ? silas . ivan , you stay with the king . Even if a counter order comes from god . We 'll find her , sir . oh , you wouldn 't dare . You don 't come . what is this ? Are you hearing music ? silas ... The sabbath queen . " ' no , you cannot go home , ' ruled the sabbath queen , " ' you stay here until you die and after . ' " not for the first time , harlow began to worry she would ever get back to her mother and homework ever again . " you 've been reading me harlowfor days , and somehow we never get to the end . I 'm a thief and a cheater . you don 't want to end it . You don 't want things to finish . only beginnings with you . you okay ? youaskme ? I 'll start again . shouldn 't we finish it ? there 's time for that . is there ? they say no . but you know better ? I do . what do you know ? you 'll live forever . I thought I would win this time . What can I do ? I don 't know . can I pray ? I 've never stped praying . pray with me . help ! Someone ! I need a doctor ! A doctor ! joseph . I don 't want any trouble . the lights are down . one night together , and you decide to bring me here ? I 've always loved this house . Used to come here in the summers , and there were no press or cameras allowed . My mom let me wear shorts . most girls , they grow up wanting to be princesses . You 're the only princess who wants to be a regular girl . you know , the caretaker 's house is miles away . We 're completely alone . we could have been alone back in the city . yeah ... But then I couldn 't have shown you this . your favorite painting ? no , I hated this . Used to give me nightmares . I had my first kiss here . I was 12 , and there was a party on the lawn for jack . And I was standing here staring at this , trying to convince myself that I could look at it without getting scared and failing ... And someone came and kissed me . not very romantic . not at all . was it a good one ? not at all . My first kiss ... stolen . Wasted . My ... whole life has been planned out and scored in perfect 4 / 4 time by forces larger than myself it 's okay . I accept it . All the disappointments and the wasted moments to come . I won 't have any regrets about anything . 'cept for this ... One wasted memory . I would have that back . I would have you in the thief 's place . ma 'am . what news , chancellor ? unityreports slow going . We start in the main plant servicing shiloh . the king feared so . He ... he wants the transformer from our plant at pella brought to the main station north of shiloh . Then have them trigger a black start . He also wants an account of that blackout 's cause , that surge . we 've already got that , ma 'am . Energy ministry traced it to a single location . A switchboard failure at the manufacturing plant in new carmel . and what company owns that plant ? crossgen , ma 'am . we 're lucky she lasted this long . there 's been severe organ failure . She 's not coming back . " ' no , you cannot go home , ' ruled the sabbath queen . " ' you stay here until you die and after . ' " even while deciding her fate , " harlow thought the sabbath queen " had eyes as blue as any sky or sea " or fruit stain she 'd ever seen . " not for the first time , harlow began to worry if she would ever get back to her mother ... " ma 'am . chancellor scholar . I was looking for him . He 's still here . yes , he 's- - He 's always here . You 've seen what I have . You alone ... Know the king is not the king . gath threatens war . Attack or retreat . Security demands decision . The country waits on his rule . and the country shall have it . it 's over . Let it be done . Tell her ... it 's okay . Tell her she can rest . finish the book . you . You make the music that drives me mad . a gift . Others meet me in silence . Out of deference to those who love you , I give warning . you came for her . You cannot have her . can 't i ? I was chosen by him who made you and all things . Leave us , you and your music . you can 't threaten me . He made death even outside his reach . you like to see us suffer . it is ... beautiful to see . Yours most of all . I come to you sometimes , silas . I look at you . then make me suffer more . Give me pain ... Endless , endless pain . Name the knife . for this life ... I would see you lose what you love more ... Your crown . it 's yours . not for me . who then ? Anyone . not anyone . To the better man . When he 's found , when he comes , you stand aside . yes . willingly , freely , you support his succession else I come for you . And you 'll live to see your name be cursed , forgotten . yes . swear it . Before all . evermore . seal the contract . You 'll wish I 'd taken her . You 'll beg to change now . the contract 's sealed . Rose , look . A partyeveryone 's invited to . because he waleft off a guest list ? beluga . You want some of this ? It 'll only spoil . Shutting down a city for want of an invitation . It 's a party . he 's my son . You 've done worse for yours . If you insist on keeping andrew in the cold , you 'd better learn to live in the dark . you have no idea what you 're dealing with . Turn the lights back on , william . no . He needs to learn . And so do you . you 're my brother , but I swear I will have your head ! more bombings from gath ? They 've destroyed our front lines . We cannot wait and do nothing ! yet silas does not come . we will not declare war without him . the king remains in meditation . On the question of war or not war ... I bring you his answer and I pray wit on his wisdom . " our hearts , armor heavy , " our grief hot as the fire we must bring . " and we must ... " to war ... And not lightly . " And the rest I - is not for me . " we launch against gath at sunrise . " our army shall seize the north as we cut gath off from the sea to leave its war machine parched and in ruins . " So writes our king . Wha- - stop it ! What are you doing ? thought there were no cameras allowed in the royal vineyard these days . give it to me . look so beautiful . keep going . really ? keep going . anybody there ? Rose . silas ? you 're gorgeous . And filthy . Could you imagine if your father saw these ? he 'd have my head . no , he 'd have worse . I 'll delete these . Don 't worry . don 't . You should keep them . To rember . you were once this happy ? Just tell me who . david . if I lose you to someone , tell me before I read about it in some newspaper . some alliance ? Something to help your father expand his empire ? it 's not him . It 's ... a promise I made . It 's my vow . I don 't understand . Who ... are you promised to ? Who are you supposed to marry ? no one . Ever . I- - I was dying . By all measures gone . I swear , I could feel my last breath coming . I could smell death in the room . I prayed to god ... And I said . " give me one more breath ... " and I 'll give it right back . " let me have another after that , and I 'll give it back again . " from now on , every breath you give me , " i 'll use it to serve you ... To live for you , for your work . " And he listened . From this day forward , i 'll earn this gift , helping others and not myself . Witness as I swear- - no , stop . Your debt is paid . I live in service for him , for them , for no happiness of my own , for no man . I beg you , don 't do this . as you live ... You cannot let me waver . Promise me . michelle . promise me . I promise you . how can I compete with god ? where are you ? Show yourself ! silas . sir , there you are . Somebody 's in the house . Stay here . I 'll clear the north wing . you come for me in my house . I 'm ready . You hear me ? I 'm ready . Come to me . now ! I 'm ready . hello , aunt rose . you brought the lights back on . I reversed his order in his name . He 'll be furus with me , but not for long . Thought you could use the help . I 'd rather live in the dark than owe you a thing . you have to go ? the lights are on . just tell me so I know . Was it real ? you 're the only real thing I ever touched . you 've made god into my enemy . it would kill me if that were true . I finally fall in love ... And he takes you from me . you love me ? do . I love you . Everyone keeps saying they know what god wants from us . I don 't know which of the voices in my head at night is his . God didn 't save your life so you c ould pretend you died . He saved it so you could live . you think he wants this . how does god not want love ? my father can 't know . I 'll send a doctor . you all right , father ? yeah , yeah . I 'm so sorry I lost you . I was looking for you . I 'm glad you 're safe . sir . you 're hurt . it 's nothing . Where were you ? I-it was a beautiful night out . I wanted to see the city . Luckily , I had a friend who wouldn 't let me go alone . He kept me safe . a friend . friend . and a gentleman . thank you . I thought you bargained me away . if I die ... I die with you . doctor says it 's a miracle . and how is the king ? The piano ? then ... my mind is clear . your daughter recovers . we are blessed . Doubly . We have back our king . thank god . you did well for us in difficult times . You should be rewarded . Lands in the countryside , I think , one of our ranches . You take your family and finally spend the time with them they deserve . you 're dismissing me ? no one ... can ever know the king broke with greatness . sir , sorry . I- - My father died . death took what was near . What is that piece ? I don 't know . Just something he taught me . Now he 's gone . you play well for him . Play on .

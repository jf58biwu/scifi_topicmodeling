 My name is Hana Gitelman . How the hell did you do that ? Satellite signals . Wi-Fi . Radio waves . Your computer can download them and so can I. So you can access the Internet without a computer , just pull e-mail out of your head ? And you 're radioactive . Why come to me ? Because they got to me , too . I can find them , Ted , and you can nuke them . NARRATOR : Previously on Heroes . Turned on the waterworks , and they were mine . They 're getting the suitcase as we speak . Where 's the bag ? You may fool Ando , but you do not fool me . ( GRUNTS ) Matt Parkman , here to protect you , sir . Sir , we 've got to get out of here right now . This is a setup . MALSKY : What ? How do you know that ? MATT : I just do . CLAUDE : Now , you absorb all these abilities that you find . Now , I 'm gonna teach you how to pull them out one at a time . I don 't have to do anything ! Except fly . MOHINDER : Hello , Zane Taylor ? Yes , you must be Dr. Suresh . Come on in . There are others out there , Iike you . And I am going to find them . I could go with you . She had an appointment with a neurologist . Your mother 's been having some headaches . Yeah , she 's also been having some memory loss . Did you tell them that ? I don 't know any Mr. Muggles , and I don 't know you . Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Where 's Dad ? He 's on one of his stupid business trips . There 's something wrong with Mom . There 's something wrong with you . Mom ? Do you know who this is ? claire , leave your brother alone . You recognize us ? Yes , you are the daughter who is supposed to be setting the dinner table . I was standing right there just a minute ago and you had no idea who I was . Lyle , help your sister with the table . Honestly , claire . Good thing Dad 's not home , 'cause he would so drug test you . It 's good you called us , Isaac . I didn 't know who else to trust . That man , Peter Petrelli , he 's gonna be responsible for all this . I tried finding him . I kept painting what I thought were empty spaces . But , now ? There , in the water . Footprints . So , Peter is invisible ? ( CHUCKLES ) That sounds so crazy . Any more than a man who can paint the future ? Peter absorbs others ' abilities . Apparently , he 's met someone who we assumed was dead . That 's the roof of the ... The Deveaux building . Look , there 's a chance that Peter might come here first before we reach him . What do you expect me to do with this ? Save the world . ( SIGHS ) Hey . Hey . You know what ? Let me do that . I am pregnant not porcelain . I know . I 'm just trying to be Mr. Helpful , here . Try Mr. Get the hell out of the way . What did you do ? Do you Iike it ? I Iove it . I do . Yeah ? Matt , we can 't afford this . I mean , we 're ... No , come on . I got a guy . He gave it to me wholesale , so ... I 'm so bloated . You look so beautiful to me . ( SIGHING ) I 'm sorry . You 've made this beautiful gesture and I have to mess it up . What do you mean ? A man called yesterday . A Professor Suresh . He was a geneticist . He wanted to talk about DNA . About your DNA . Did you tell him anything ? I mean , you didn 't tell him anything , did you ? Of course I didn 't tell him anything . But he found you . He knows . Geneticist . Who are these people ? Before we go in , I just wanted to say thanks . For what ? Well , you know , for bringing me with you . You didn 't have to do that . It would have been a Iong road alone . I 'm glad for the company . Well , I believe in fate , Mohinder , and karma . And I 'm not just saying that 'cause you 're Indian . I mean , you really came to my rescue and I won 't forget that . Well , it 's not completely altruistic on my part , Zane . I have a feeling we 're going to meet up with a Iot of skepticism from these people . You can help . I 'm ready . MOHINDER : Excuse me ? Excuse me ? Oh ... ( RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON WALKMAN ) ( CHUCKLES ) Rap music . Can 't stand it , but it 's the only thing I 've found that cancels out the ... Can I help you ? We 're looking for Dale Smither . You found her . Oh . Of course . I 'm Mohinder Suresh and this is Mr. Taylor . Well , it 's Zane , actually . It 's just Zane . I Ieft you several messages this week . Yeah , I got them I believe I can help with what 's happening to you . I 'm sure you have lots of questions . Yeah , only one . How 'd you find me ? You gave blood 1 1 years ago , signed a consent form to have a sample used in a program called the Human Genome Project . You dialed the wrong number . Look , I know what you 're thinking right now , that you 've got nobody to talk to , nobody that understands what you 're going through . But that 's not true . I understand . Yeah ? Damn . That was my best wrench . So , there really are others , huh ? Yes . I 'm proof of that . That 's why we 're here . I thought the headaches at first were gonna kill me . I 'd lie awake at night thinking that my head was gonna explode . A cockroach crawling across my neighbor 's floor was like a marching band parading through my house . I 'm sorry . It must be quite a burden . A burden ? ( LAUGHS ) Hell , no . This is the best damn thing that ever happened to me . Well , now that I 've learned to control it , I 'm like Superman or something . I can hear rain coming from 40 miles away . I can even hear someone 's moods . The tiniest changes in a heartbeat . ( HEART BEATING ) Yours , for instance . It 's racing kind of fast . You nervous about something ? No . I 'm just excited to meet somebody like me . Well , if you 've come to try to take it away from me , you 're gonna have a hell of a fight on your hands . I can assure you , we only want to help . I 'd Iike to perform a few tests , some questions , really , that 's all . Shouldn 't take more than a couple hours . I 'm kind of backed up today . We can come back in the morning . Okay . ( HIRO SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( GRUNTING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) You 're not Ando . S.R. Gustafson , State Gaming Commission . I come in peace . What 's an Ando ? Ando is my friend . I bring him from Japan on my mission . ( WHIMPERS ) Where 's the girl ? Where 's the suitcase ? She say her name Hope . Tell me where they are ! Take me with you . I must save Ando . Not a chance . I work alone , pal . You take me with you , or she gets away , pal . I so miss you , Karen . I miss your laugh . But they 're gonna pay for what they did to me . What they did to us . I know you 're not gonna like what I got to do . So I came to say goodbye . ( MEN GRUNTING ) Enough ! I say when it 's enough ! You 've got the power to stop me . What are you waiting for ? ( YELLS ) ( GRUNTING ) I 'm trying ! And when you 've left New York a smoking wasteland , we 'II put that on your tombstone . " Here lies Peter Petrelli . He tried . " ( GROANS ) Dig into that file cabinet of yours and pull something out . fly , stop time , paint me a pretty picture . Do something unexpected ! ( PANTING ) ( LAUGHS ) You pushed that away with your mind . Which one of your sorry friends has telekinesis ? None of them do . Oh , wait , that guy who was chasing claire in Texas . He sent some lockers flying at me . Texas ? And you pulled that little trick out in the here and now . Well , we might just have a chance at stopping you from going nuclear . I tried . Every street I painted , every building empty . I think Peter 's left New York . Why does this seem so familiar ? Oh , now I remember . You 'd get that same look on your face when you 'd lie to me about using . You think I 'm lying ? You 're right . I can 't willingly throw you into another man 's arms . Because you 're jealous . Because he 's dangerous . Oh , God . I don 't think I should have this , anymore . Keep it , please . I would do anything for you , Simone . Anything . Find Peter . ( HUMMING ) Look , you 're nothing but a Japanese MapQuest for me , so , until we find that girl , just sit there and shut up . I bring Ando from Japan on my mission . I am responsible for him . AII a partner ever does is either drag you under or screw you over . A partner helps by believing in you . He keeps you honest . Uh-huh ? Well , who wanted to help the girl ? Grab the suitcase ? Take your car ? Ando . You take on a partner , all you get is their blood on your hands . Why are we stopping here ? I thought we were going to your mother 's house . The less questions you ask , Ando , the better off you 'II be in life . Why is that ? That 'd be another question . Here , I will help you with your bag . No , I 've got it . It 's okay . Let me help you . No , I 've got it ! What is this ? What did I say about asking questions ? Now , I have to admit , Zane , when you first offered to help , I was cautious . In what way ? I don 't know you . You don 't know me . It could have been a disaster . But you made a difference today . Thank you . Here 's your key . When you told that woman Dale you could help her , is that really possible ? It 's only theoretical at this point , but I am working on an inhibitor . A chemical that will isolate the genetic mutation that causes these abnormalities . I mean , we can offer these people understanding , control , or , if needed , elimination of their ability . elimination ? You make it sound like a virus or plague . I 'm sorry , I didn 't mean to imply . It 's just ... Well , not all of you exhibit the same sets of skills you do . I mean , they could be dangerous . My father had to Iearn that firsthand . How 's that ? He was murdered by a man named Sylar . Well , what happened to this Sylar ? I 'm not sure . He just got away with killing your dad ? I only know he 's gone , locked away . I mean , what does it matter ? Even if I could come face to face with him , what difference would it make ? Justice can never really be served . What a shame . They 're out there . I can feel them . So innocent , so unaware of what 's happening to them . We 'II find them , Mohinder , all of them , together , the two of us . It 's our destiny . I 'm gonna call it a night . Yeah . I 'II catch you in the morning . ( SIGHING ) claire , do we need to talk ? No . Yes . Mom , you know how you sometimes forget things ? Honey , is this about my trip to the neurologist ? It 's just some headaches . I don 't want you to worry . But they don 't know what 's causing it , right ? We are still waiting on the results from the tests . What if it 's not something that 's responsible for it , but someone ? What on Earth are you talking about ? What if you knew a secret and they had a way to brainwash you ? ( CHUCKLES ) You have been studying long enough . Let 's curl up in my bed , piece of pie , glass of milk , and watch an old Cary Grant movie . Mom , I 'm serious . I know this is a Iittle scary , but Dad 's in charge of talking to the doctors and they will come up with the answers . Maybe you shouldn 't trust Dad so much . Now , why would you say that ? What if it gets worse and the next time you ... ( THUDDING ) Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! ( PANTING ) Mom , please wake up . What 's this all about , anyway ? What 's what ? The birds . I mean , you sort of hate everything , everyone , except you treat these pigeons like they 're family . Charles Darwin bred pigeons when he was working out his theory of evolution . Married up various permutations to get maximum potential . What do you mean by that , maximum potential ? I think he meant you , friend . Well , you used to care , about all this . Didn 't you ? AII right , sharing time 's over . Time to get ... ( SCREAMS ) What are you doing ? Something unexpected . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) claire , this isn 't a great time . Dad , you have to come home . Mom fell and she blacked out . I called 911 . What happened to her ? I came home and she didn 't even know who I was . She didn 't even remember Mr. Muggles . I 'm coming home right away . claude will have to wait . Matt , where are you ? Hey , what 's up ? The ring . I took it to get resized , and the jeweler told me it was worth $ 40,000 . Well , that 's ridiculous . Then he accused me of stealing it . I had to tell him my husband was a cop and there has to be some kind of an explanation . There is an explanation , right ? The guy that I was protecting , Malsky , those were his . You have to give them back . I can 't . I can 't . He 's dead . I need to sit down . See ... Honey , this is why I didn 't want to tell you about this , okay ? You were gonna get upset , and with the ... You let me keep the ring ! It was stolen property . What were you thinking ? I don 't know what I was thinking . I have no idea . You know , Matt , for a guy that can read other people 's thoughts , you should spend a Iittle bit of time on your own . You know what ? I 'm just trying to figure out how to take care of our family . I don 't have a job , Jan ! And I 'm worried that the baby ... You know ... Ever since you told me about this thing , this thing that you do , I have tried to act like everything 's okay , but it 's not . Stealing and lying ? Matt , you 're better than this . AII right . Fine , I 'II take them down to the precinct . Call them right now . What ? Call them right now ! ( PHONE RINGING ) Hello ? What ? Where are you right now ? Yeah . Yeah , I know the place . I 'II be right there . Who was that ? I gotta go out . Where ? Matt . How are you feeling ? You knew they were after you . Who ? I don 't know who they were . You wanted to know why I was invisible all these years ? It was because of them , and you 've brought the bastards right to my door . I just saved your ass ! You have no idea what you 've done . Your mate , the painter , he took your girl up to the roof . He must have known we were up there . Isaac ? He 's a comic book artist . Let 's call a spade a shovel , mate . It had to be Isaac . They 've got to him . You said yourself he disappeared for a bit , right ? Yeah , so ? Well , that 's how it works . At least , that 's how it did in my day . You drop off the face of the Earth for a few days , wake up with a memory hole , a killer headache , and a souvenir . Did he have a set of these ? No , what is that ? Those are for the lucky ones . So , what do we do now ? Hey ! We ? You watch your own back , I do what I always do , disappear . Hey , I 'm not letting you run again . We 're getting somewhere with all this . Well , you should have thought of that before you brought your baggage to my roof . Hey , I can 't do this on my own . Then I guess you go boom . SIMONE : Have you heard from Peter ? Last time I saw my brother , he flew out of a window to get away from me . I doubt he 's going to come knocking on my door . He flew out a window ? So to speak . ( CHUCKLES ) Simone , I 've got people looking for him , people I can trust , around the clock . We 'II find him . But what if you don 't ? You need to go public . Call a press conference . Tell everyone about Peter 's condition . Nobody 's gonna believe somebody can explode and destroy a city , Simone . I can 't believe I believe it . Let 's tell them everything . Isaac painting the future , Hiro stopping time , even you . What you all can do is incredible . It 's time people know what 's happening , the truth . Simone , look , I know your heart is in the right place . You want to help Peter and I want to help him , too . But if people knew what we were capable of , they would drop a collective brick . You think they 'II burn you at the stake ? Yeah . Pretty much . Because that 's what I would do . I 'd round us all up , stick us in a lab on some island in the middle of the ocean . Where Peter saw hope , you see disaster . I guess I 'm voting for the other guy . Simone . Do not take this public . But , you kissed me . I thought you liked me . Don 't remind me . What will happen to me , now ? HOPE : Damn it ! Hope ! I want my share . Andokun ! Hiro ! ( ANDO SCREAMS ) Andokun ! ( GUNS FIRING ) Andokun ! ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) HOPE : Gustavson , you can 't stake it if you 're dead ! GUSTAVSON : Neither can you ! ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) HOPE : Come out ! ( EXPLOSION ) ( POLICE SIREN WAILING ) Got you ! OFFICER : ( ON LOUDSPEAKER ) Get your hands in the air . GUSTAVSON : Come here ! HOPE : Get off of me ! ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON WALKMAN ) ( HEART BEATING ) Funny , I didn 't hear your footsteps . That 's because there weren 't any . That sound , in your heart , what is it ? ( HEART BEATING FASTER ) Murder . Is my mom gonna be okay ? She 's stable . When your dad gets here , we can discuss options . Options ? claire , why don 't you come sit down ? Your mother has a subdural hemorrhage . I got a C minus in biology . Oh , it 's ... It 's like a bruise on her brain . Specifically the area that controls memory . Has your mother had any recent exposure to radiation ? A history of epilepsy ? claire , if this is a result of domestic violence ... No . No , it 's not Iike that . Not really . Then what 's it like ? You won 't believe me . Anything you say will be held in the strictest confidence . There 's a man who works for my dad . He can make you forget things . Anything . Just by touching you with his hands . I 'II talk to your father . Wait ! I 'm telling you the truth ! Hey . I only came here because you said it was a matter of Iife and death . You can 't go blowing anything else up . I found out what these are . They 're tracking us like animals . What the hell 's that supposed to mean ? The truth . Hey ! What 's going on ? Ted ? She 's a friend , okay ? Like us . She 's the one who put me on to the scratches . It comes from a pneumatic needle . It injects a radioisotope for tracking viruses in Africa . That 's what we are to them . A virus . plague . Who 's them ? A shipment of needles went to Primatech Paper in Odessa , Texas . The tracking slip went to a man named Bennet . Sound familiar ? I 've already been down this road . Trust me , it 's a dead end . Really ? Yeah . Why would a paper company need pneumatic needles with a radioisotope ? I had my blood tested . It 's in me , that isotope . Ted , you 're radioactive by nature . How much you want to bet it 's in you , too ? No , that 's insane . No ! I want to put this whole thing behind me . My wife and I have a baby coming . My family needs me ! Wait , you 've got a family , that means you 've got something to protect . There is no putting this whole thing behind you . We 've got to find out what they did and make them fix it . If they can track us , Iike you say they can , he 'II know we 're coming ! Good . I can get us through any wall they got . I need you to get inside his head . He can 't lie to us if you 're there . We 'II find out the truth . Look , I cannot do this without you . If we can save ourselves , we could help others . We could be heroes . LYLE : Dad . It 's all right . I 've convinced the doctor to let us take her home in the morning . MR. BENNET : She 'II be okay . No thanks to you . Shut up , claire . claire , could I talk to you outside ? please ? Doctor told me you had an interesting theory about your mom 's condition . It 's not a theory . You did this to her . You erased her mind . claire , that 's ridiculous . You tried to erase mine . I don 't know where you 're getting these ideas . Stop . Stop it ! Stop lying ! After what you did to Mom , isn 't that enough ? What you know is dangerous . If the wrong people find out about what you can do ... Like the man who killed Jackie ? Exactly . Why ? Why did you do this to Mom ? A few days ago , that man broke into our house , looking for you . He found your mother instead , so I made her forget . Your mother is a gentle soul , and people like her shouldn 't have to know about people like him . And , maybe , people like you . I never meant for her to get sick . I only wanted to protect my family . claire Bear . I promise , I promise this will never happen again . No ! You don 't just get to say you 're sorry and make everything go away . ( RAP MUSIC PLAYING ) Zane , are you all right ? Yeah , it 's just ... It 's just a headache . Okay . Sit tight . I 'II be back . ( SHARP BUZZING ) ( GROANS ) Hello ? ( GROANS ) Anybody here ? Maybe we should just come back , Mohinder . Dale ! ( COUGHING ) Mohinder , what 's the matter ? ( GASPING ) ( MOHINDER DIALING PHONE ) What are you doing ? I 'm dialing 911 . Do you think that 's a good idea ? What are you talking about ? She was murdered . And what were we doing here ? What do you mean ? We found her . How ? Why ? I mean , look at us . Where did we come from ? How did we get here ? Can we explain any of this without looking completely insane ? The top of her head was removed . It was Sylar . I don 't ... I mean , how ? Sylar ? Okay . Okay , we have to warn them , everyone on the list . He 's after them . We 'II leave now and we 'II call the police anonymously from the road . Come on . ( SHARP BUZZING ) Zane , are you okay ? ( RAP MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING ) ( MAN CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO ) Hiro . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ANDO : Hiro ! Hey , young fellow . AII by yourself ? Yes . Just me . Lyle . claire , we 'II get through this . Your mom needs us . Lyle , too . I don 't even know if I 'II remember any of this tomorrow . AII I wanna do is run away , but I can 't . Somebody has to protect this family from you . Lyle , take your mother , get out of the house , right now . Dad ? ( GUN COCKING ) I 'm sure you have a Iot of questions . MATT : We all do . Why 'd you do it , Isaac ? How 'd you get in here ? What 'd they give you ? Money ? Drugs ? What 's a Judas get these days ? I was trying to stop you . You 're dangerous , you said it yourself . Without them to help , you 'II become that . I had help . I was learning to control it . You scared my only chance of hope ! We can stop it . What are these marks , huh ? What do they mean ? ( GRUNTS ) They 're nothing . They mean nothing . Don 't lie to me ! ( YELLS ) This is why you sent them after me ? Jealousy ? With me out of the way , you 'd have Simone all to yourself . You stole her away from me ! But I did it to save New York , to stop the bomb . I can do it right now . With just one bullet , I can be a hero . PETER : You 're not a hero , Isaac . You 're a junkie . You couldn 't even save yourself . That 's why she left you , Isaac . It had nothing to do with me ! Show yourself ! ( SIMONE WHIMPERING ) Simone ! No . No .

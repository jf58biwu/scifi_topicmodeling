 Mr Carver . The word is now . The word is now . - Yes ? - Got a job for you . Big one . You available ? Yes . He 's a mercenary ? More like THE mercenary . Nice ringtone . It saved a friend of mine 's life once . How ? It made me laugh . Drink ? - What 's this ? - It 's a cheque . There 's no figure . Use your imagination . - It goes down seven floors . - Six . - There are seven on the plans . - Six that concern you . Six floors you can do what you like with . We 've got more money than God . We 've got weapons tech that would give a nun a hard-on . Welcome to the world of you want , you got . What 's on the seventh floor ? This place was built to hide a secret . - Now we need a fortress . - More than a fortress . A trap . Dr Tom Jackman . What about him ? - I think his neck 's broken . - Tell him thanks . - Hello ? - Hello , it 's me , Benjamin . The word is ... go . The word is go . Get the men ready . We 're going to London . - We 're bringing him in . - Sir ! Mr Lennox ? I 'm sorry , Benjamin can 't come to the phone right now . The word is now , Mr Carver . Dr Jackman ? Mr Hyde ? Mr Hyde , I 've waited a long time to do this . Best you got ? 'Cause if that 's the best you 've got , Mr Syme , I 'll tell you what the word is . The word is hide ! Your children must be starving . I know what boys are like . Are you hungry , boys ? Would you like some breakfast ? There 's brekkie inside , bacon and everything . Come . You really think I 'd trust you to feed my children ? You have a point . What you don 't have is a choice . You have beautiful boys , Mrs Jackman , and they 're perfectly safe with us . Mrs Jackman ... Mrs Hyde , for now . Just so you remember . Just so you keep in mind what 's coming . I 'm Mrs Hyde . And , honey ... just you wait till my husband gets home . In the meantime , I 'd offer you breakfast , but the truth is ... we don 't have any . - No ! - They 're fine , Mrs Jackman . Completely safe in these things . Get them out of there , for God 's sake ! They 're children ! Get them out of there ! Mrs Jackman , we don 't want the equipment damaged . Mummy , I can 't see ! I can 't see ! - Eddie ! No ! - Mummy , I can 't see ! Harry ! No ! No ... There you go , dear . Give that a minute . - Please ... - Sit her down . There . That 's better , isn 't it ? Claire . It 's all right , it 's me . Don 't be afraid . He 's gone . Do you hear me , Alice ? Do you hear me , Alice ? Do you hear me ? Claire ? Oh ... Don 't look so scared . I 'm not one of them . They don 't even know I 'm here , so shhh . Then what are you doing here ? How did you get in ? Who are you ? You 're every bit as beautiful as your pictures . He 's a lucky boy , my son . Tom 's mother is dead . Then I must be a ghost . Where am I ? At the beginning . This is Klein Utterson , mark one . There are a lot of secrets here and they keep them underground . Buried deep below this building . What secrets ? Do you want to know the truth ? About Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and how they came back from the dead ? I just want my boys . - That 's all I want . - It 's the same thing . Then of course I want to know . Good . Claire ? Just wanted to make sure you were all right . They 've unpacked everything . Er ... For anything else , there 's a phone . Strictly internal , I 'm afraid . I want my children . - They 're perfectly safe . - In boxes ? Safest place in the world , those boxes . You should get back to sleep . They gave you a bit of a hefty dose . Be in your bloodstream for a while . He 's coming , Peter . My husband . And do you know what ? He 'll be coming for you first . Goodnight , Mrs Jackman . She has a point . I 've seen what he can do . He 's remarkable , yes , but he 's alone . No one to turn to , no one he can trust . Everything he knew has betrayed him . No friends , no home , no hope . No one . Not even Tom Jackman , not even Hyde himself 's a threat when they 're completely alone . Well , well . Look what the cat dragged in . It 's the next stage of human evolution . - Hello , Dr Jackman . - Cup of tea ? What are you doing here ? Those people can track you anywhere . Oh , I know . Right now they 're tracking us all over Dartmoor . They just called in another team , sent us straight into a bog . This is Gavin Hardcastle . One of the men who tried to shoot us last night and bury us in a ditch . - I hit him with a bit of wood . - Clever old Gavin ( ! ) He 's got us cornered and he 's calling in the troops . Hardcastle , we 've not got a visual yet . Over . Hardcastle , are you receiving me ? Please restate your last position . Over . So , whose turn to choose a map reference for Mr Hardcastle ? Please confirm your last location . We all seem to be standing in the middle of a duck pond . Over . They 've taken your family , haven 't they ? Yes . What we need is the current location for your wife and children . What we have is a man in his shorts in the know . It 's a start , Dr Jackman . We 're not beaten yet . I ... I ... I don 't know what to say . Can I vote very strongly for nothing ? - None of you needed to . I didn 't ... - Cup of tea ? Yes , thanks . We 've got the good one ? - There 's only one tea . - Yes , but the one I like . We 've only ever had one tea . I always give you the same . Oh ... I 'll just ... Kettle . She really likes you , Dr Jackman . She prefers you to Mr Sexy Pants , so there 's no accounting for taste . Mr Sexy Pants can hear you . We 're doing double shifts . He 's awake . What did he say ? It 's a boy . I said it was . I did , didn 't I ? I said . I take it Mr Sexy Pants has made up his mind whose side he 's on ? For now . Right , so we need to find your wife and family . Knock yourself out . I know what Klein Utterson can do to people . Do you really think I 'll sell them out to you ? No . Not to me . Where 's Hardcastle ? Probably Glasgow by now . And still running . - Got what you needed , though ? - Yes . What 's wrong with your hand ? Nothing . That 's what 's so odd . Hyde 's got a cut across his palm . He got it late last night . Hasn 't healed properly . But I don 't have it , and I 've never had it . It 's like we 're not sharing the damage any more . I didn 't know you could be injured separately . Hasn 't happened till now . Maybe he thinks I can 't cope any more . Can you ? I 'd better . Your suitcase is packed in the hall . And the letter you 're writing is addressed to me . You 're leaving now , aren 't you ? When I get back , assuming I get back , I won 't be needing this place any more . Or me . I 'll be gone in a minute or two . You should probably get back to bed , get some sleep . Anything you need before you leave ? No , I 'll be fine , thanks . OK . Goodnight , Miss Reimer . Good luck , Dr Jackman . Tom ! Tom ... Oh , Tom , what have they done to you ? Tom , can you hear me ? It 's OK . It 's OK , I 'm here ... Oh , baby ... Oh , God ! It 's all right . They 're harmless . You 're perfectly safe . What are they ? Syme told you they attempted to clone Dr Jekyll , didn 't he ? Did he tell you how far they got , or how many times they tried ? This is where Klein Utterson made its fortune . These rooms . Drugs created from the antibodies in these poor creatures . - You said you were Tom 's mother . - Yes . You 're not , are you ? You just work here . This is where Tom comes from . I don 't work here . I 'm not even supposed to be here . What does that mean ? - Tom is not a clone . - Then where did Tom come from ? From me . I 'm his mother . He 's a Jekyll . A direct descendant of the original man . Dr Jekyll didn 't have any descendants . - Dr Jekyll died a virgin . - You 're not making sense . You know how this works better than anyone . If Dr Jekyll is a virgin , then what is Mr Hyde ? Edinburgh in the 1860s ? No birth control and Hyde rampant ? The world is full of Hyde 's bastard descendants , teeming with them . Split personalities , Siamese twins . Tom Jackman is just one of many descendants . But he is the only perfect one . The only perfect throwback , a chance in a million , a perfect genetic duplicate , generations later . We tracked him yet ? Any word ? Look at that . Birds flying at night . Looks like they 're flying away from something , like a fire . Freeman ? - Is there a fire ? - Sorry , what ? Is there a fire ? Has anyone checked ? Um ... I don 't know . Don 't think so , no . We would have heard . Then what 's in the forest ? Why are they ... flying away ? Why are they leaving ? " Run if you want to live . " Here , look . It doesn 't matter what I type . Look . People think Hyde is rage or hate , or greed , or lust . But Hyde is far worse . What is he ? What was the first day you knew you could kill anyone if you had to ? The day I first held my children . It 's our oldest , deadliest impulse . The need to protect our own at the expense of any other living thing . And we give that impulse such a nice name , don 't we ? Hyde ... is love . And love is a psychopath . Dr Jekyll loved . In 1864 , he fell in love with a serving girl . That 's her . Alice Cameron . She 's standing at his shoulder . They found themselves a new Dr Jekyll , but it was Hyde they wanted . To summon Hyde , you need Alice Cameron . They needed to bring back the only woman Dr Jekyll has ever loved . Tom Jackman isn 't a clone , Claire . You are . No . No . What the hell 's happening with these lights ? - I just got a text . - What ? I 'm real ! I have a life ! Of course you 're real . You 're as real as anyone is . But you were a baby in these rooms . You came from here . Grown from the cells of Alice Cameron . You 've dreamed of this place , haven 't you ? You always dreamt of it . - No , I have a mother and a father ! - Who love you very much . They should . They were chosen for you . What 's happening ? Run if you want to live . Run if you want to live . - What 's happening ? - Run if you want to live ... Jesus Christ . That 's not possible . Did somebody do this ? Is this a joke ? He 's in our heads . He 's messing with our heads . Look , the real words are still here , it 's ... it 's like he 's transmitting . It 's bleeding into everything . That 's impossible . Yeah ? You want to tell that to the guy who switched off London ? - Mr Freeman , you stay here . - Mr Syme , no , I won 't . - You get one warning ! - Mr Syme , the devil is coming ! The most powerful thing alive on the planet is coming , right to our door ! And we 've got his missus locked up upstairs . Do you seriously think anyone in this room is frightened of you ? Sit down . Give that to me . Give it to me ! You sit down ! You 're not serious ? Jesus Christ . Sorry about that , it just ... just , er ... just went off . Bloody hell , that hurts ! Sorry , everyone . Er ... is everyone OK ? Just a stupid mistake , that 's all . Er ... If everyone just , er ... If you 'd just stay calm ... Er ... just stay calm and sit down . You 'II ... I think ... Please , just ... just sit . If you just stay where you ... What 's happening to the lights ? - Is the power going ? - It 's your husband . Love has arrived . It 's everywhere . Oh , my God ! It 's them ! It 's my boys . Help me ! Oh , God ! Help me ! Your men . Will they stay ? I 'll round up those who will . I 'll kill those who won 't . Yeah , well , try and get that the right way round , won 't you ? Christ . Most of my staff seem to have taken the night off . Very impressive . How does it feel to be half a god ? I 'm the other half . Sounds a bit Denis Thatcher . Yeah . Drink ? You look bloody awful . I 'm dying . To old times ? To twenty years of lies ? To friendship . So . Where do you want to start ? How long has this been going on ? Oh , since the beginning . It was my job to befriend you . That 's why we met . There wasn 't a day I betrayed you . It was the deal from the beginning . Your defence is that it was all lies , not just most of it ? I was never lying . We WERE friends . - How can you say that ? - Because it 's true . I was your friend . I am . As it happens , I 'm also ... My enemy . Oh , for God 's sake , Tom , you know me . I don 't like anyone . Except for my daughters . I mean , I don 't talk to anyone except you . - You 're the only friend I ever had . - And look what you did . Oh , for God 's sake , Tom , grow up . No one 's who you think they are . - Haven 't you learned that yet ? - Learning it now ! People have different sides . Sorry , just remembered who I 'm talking to . That 's ... Is Hyde going to kill me ? I don 't know . Is there a way for me to ... to ? Tell me how you justify what you 've done . Explain to me how you can be forgiven for what you did . Is he listening ? Yes . - He 's a psychopath , for God 's sake ! - Aren 't we all ? OK , OK . Um ... There is such a thing as the greater good . Hyde is a marvel . The next stage in human evolution , no exaggeration . With Hyde , we could cure every illness known to man . He 's ... he 's a blueprint for a better kind of human being . To have Hyde back is worth almost anything . And one day people will understand . One day people will thank us for what we 're doing now . Even you , even your family , even Claire will thank us . There have been sacrifices along the way . There are always sacrifices . You don 't start out that way , but it 's inevitable . It 's the way things are . Advancement comes at a cost . Sometimes at a cost to your friends . What does that count against the good that can be done ? The greater good . No . I can justify myself , Tom , because I believe ... I do , I absolutely firmly believe there is such a thing as the greater good . Now ! This would kill a normal man . Be Tom again . Let it kill him . You don 't have to share the damage ! Actually , let him die . He 's dying anyway , he 's ageing to death . That means genetically , you 're separating . You don 't have to physically share the damage . Become Tom again . Let Tom die ! Oh , God . Shut it off . Shut the gas off . Extractor fans . Now ! What happened ? You said it wouldn 't kill him . It wasn 't supposed to ! He 's dead , for God 's sake ! He 's bloody dead ! We 've killed him ! What 's the point in any of this if he 's dead ? The gas is at non-toxic levels now , Mr Syme . Keep your mask on , but it should be safe . - Keep your mask on , until we can ... - Oh , shut up ! Strange , his ... his lungs are expanded like they 're full of air . - Do you think he 's faking ? - Not unless he can stop his heart ! He can . Mr Syme , that 's not air in his lungs . Tom . Tom ... Tom , Tom , please don 't let him ... Tom ... Old friend . We can stop him . What for ? He 's going exactly where we want him to . Tom ? Tom ! Claire ! - Oh , Christ ! What 's this ? What now ? - Where are the boys ? In there . They 're in those boxes like you were . I can 't get in . Wait . Try this . - Where did you get that ? - Just get the boys out of there . Dr Jackman . We have your family . We have you . It is over . Excuse me . Talking to my wife . Claire , we need him again . - I 'm sorry . - It 's OK . It 's not OK . He 's not OK . He 's you . You 're him . And it 's OK . It 's always been OK . I mean , what the hell ? You bag yourself a handsome doctor , there 's bound to be a bit of baggage . Dr Jackman ! You 'll be kind enough to turn around now . - Don 't dim the lights this time . - What ? I want to see it happen . I want to see you change . Why ? Been over a hundred years , you and I. Did you know that ? - Yeah . - Well , then ... don 't you think it 's about time I saw my husband naked ? Just for you . No one else sees this . Not ever . Hello , toots . Hello , sugar . Look at you , Mrs Jackman . Look at you . - Wasted on him , you are . - Well , I have been , many times . Ooh , let 's make that a date . It 's a date . But not for you . I might peek . - I might let you . - Ooh , baby ... - Dr Jackman ... - Talking to my wife ! Mr Hyde ! Nothing has changed . This is over . We have your family . You have six guys with guns . Make it interesting . Give me names , I 'll do ' em in alphabetical order . Move ! Mrs Jackman , get the kids . We 're leaving . Talking at the back ! Something you want to share with the class - Tom , I don 't know how to open them ! - Mummy ? - Harry . - Mummy ! Eddie ... Oh , God . Eddie , it 's OK . I 'm here . Mummy 's here . - Mummy , we can 't see . - I 'm right here , baby . - Mummy ! We can 't see ! - Mummy , please let me out ! What 's happening ? What 's happening ? We have cut the power to the life supports , Mr Hyde . No ! Please , you can 't ! No ! If you want to know how long your children have to live , Mr Hyde , hold your breath . Switch the power back on , right now . - Change back to Dr Jackman . - Why would I do that ? Because we can take Dr Jackman . Then you 'd have my family . So will you . You 're not having my family ! Tom , they 're suffocating ! They can 't breathe ! It 's me you want . They 're dying ! Now there 's an idea . Coming down there , boys . Just coming to turn the power on . Don 't want any trouble . - Stop , or we fire ! - Hold your fire . Nobody fires . - I 'm coming , boys ... - Stop or we fire ! Got a problem with that ? - Nobody fire ! Nobody ... - Didn 't think so . Stop , stop ! Stop shooting ! Look at that . Look what you did . This was clean on this morning ! You want to be careful with those . You could put someone 's eye out . What ? You think that 's enough ? For me ? I 'm Mr Hyde ! Show a little respect ! Colonel Hart , when he 's done , freeze the body . I 'm sure we can find something we can use . Your family will be safe to leave . Someone 's going to kill you for that , Colonel . Then I 'll die . Here it comes . Ooh ... Tickles . Tom ! Mrs Jackman ! Your children . Oh , God ! I 'm sorry , Tom . Tom , I 'm so sorry ... Oh ... Are you all right ? Let me look at you . - Are you all right ? - Yes , Mummy . How do you feel ? Do you feel OK ? Were you scared ? You must have been so scared . It was scary when we couldn 't breathe . Of course it was . Of course it was scary . But it was boring most of the time . Why did they put us in the boxes , Mummy ? I don 't know . They were stupid men . Stupid , stupid men . They even put you in the wrong boxes . No , we swapped . What do you mean , you swapped ? They didn 't know , but we did . We swapped . You mean you got out of the caskets ? How ? We didn 't get out . We just got so bored . We swapped . Sorry , Mummy . Where 's Daddy ? Come here . Come and give Mummy a great big hug . But Daddy ... He can 't ... He 's not ... - Daddy . - I 'm sorry , Eddie . Eddie , baby , I 'm so sorry . Daddy , why is Mummy crying ? He didn 't share the damage . He let me go . Mummy . Here I come ! - Oh ! Mwa ! - Be the horsie . Let 's go over here . # You can 't catch me # Oh , yes , I can You all right ? He 's gone . He 's really gone . I didn 't think it would feel like this . I thought ... I thought it would feel good . Did you know he could do that ? Take the bullets for you ? It wasn 't for me , Claire . It wasn 't for me . It 's over , though . I promise you . You know that , don 't you ? Shh . How did you find me ? I know a good detective . I imagine you have questions . I am not a direct descendant of Henry Jekyll . This is my father . There 's no connection with the Jekyll family line , bastard or otherwise . Not possible . I am not a direct descendant of Henry Jekyll , so where do I come from ? - How are your wife and children ? - They 're very well , thank you . And you ? I still have three bullets in me , but I seem to have healed around them . The legacy of Mr Hyde . The legacy ? You think it 's over , don 't you ? You don 't even know how it began . Not really . And it 's never over , Tom . Never , ever . I need to know where I come from . I need the truth . I need to know why you left me at a railway station . Why you had to protect yourself by rejecting me . Your father was a good man , a very good man . - I miss him . - But he wasn 't a Jekyll . A good man until the day he died . What did he die of ? What killed him ? Hm ? Oh , I expect I did . I must check . - What ? - You still don 't understand , do you ? What do you think I 've been fighting all this time ? You should know . You didn 't get the curse of the Jekylls from your father . You got it from me . Hello , darling . How smart you 're looking . What 's wrong , sweetie ? Don 't you have a kiss for Mommy ? Come on , sweetie , kiss for Mommy . Kiss for Mommy . A kiss for Mommy ...

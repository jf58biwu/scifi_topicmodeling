 I must have gotten your ability on the street . Ability ? Peter Petrelli ? Hiro . - You 're { \ * supposed to be } the man with a plan . { \ * , remember ? } - I 'm not sure I 'm that guy anymore . Well , it 's just , you know , kind of sad when you ... look back on your life , you realize it hasn 't amounted to much . What are you talking about ? Your life is about helping people . { \ * Your whole life has been about trying to helping people . } But I don 't remember actually helping ... anybody . The guy don 't know his name , what day it is , nothing . I 'm gonna help you . You 're a watchmaker from queens , who murdered your own mother . No ! What are you waiting for ? A broken vessel . An empty shell . What is a man without mind , without memory ? A ghost ? A body in search of a soul ? With no compass to guide us , how can we know if our destiny is to seek the good ... Or obey the demons that whisper in our ear ? The blank slate hungers to be written upon . The body thrives when the heart has a mission . How you feeling , hiro ? You collapsed in my apartment last night . You remember ? And you brought me to the hospital ? I spoke to the doctors . Hiro , you 're very sick . Yes , I know . Brain tumor . I 'm dying . I guess I didn 't want to believe that I would end up in a hospital bed so soon , but ... Here I am . Look , I know about dying . I 've helped a lot of people through this transition . And I 'm gonna help you with whatever you need . Maybe that 's why you came to me . Maybe . But maybe not . Destiny has been sending me to different places , different times , to right many wrongs before I die . Maybe destiny has brought me to you , Peter ... To fix a problem in your life . No , my ... my life is fine . I really don 't need any fixing . What if , you didn 't come here so that you can fix me ? What if I could fix you ? { \ What if you 're here so that I can fix you ? } I 've seen the best doctors in japan . - There 's nothing that can be done . - Maybe not by doctors . The faster I can go ... The faster I can get back . Go ... go where ? Just sit tight , okay ? I 'll be right back . Okay . Are you okay ? Did you send a cello to my apartment ? A cello ? No . Something is wrong with my ability , or whatever you call it . There 's nothing wrong ... It 's confusing , at first . I know . It 's difficult for everyone in the beginning . And I want to talk about it with you , but I can 't . - Right now I have to leave . - Leave ? My friend is dying , and it can 't wait . You know what ... You have questions about abilities ? You should talk to him . He knows everything { \ * there is to know } about abilities . His name is Hiro . Talk to him , and I 'll be back soon . Where are you going ? To save his life . He 's not what you expected . For years I 've heard rumors , stories . Sylar , the most powerful one of all . But that man seems beaten . Afraid . What happened to him { \ * , lydia } ? I 'm not sure . It 's like there are two sides at war within him . Good morning , Sylar . How 'd you sleep ? You called me Sylar . Who 's Sylar ? That 's you . That 's your name . The police told me my name is Gabriel . You don 't even know your name ? What happened to you ? I don 't know . I can 't remember . You know what I think ? I think a great damage has been done to you . And you 've come to us to heal . Walk with me . Spend the day among us , and with time , your memories will return . What do we call you ... Gabriel ? Sylar ? Take a deep breath . What 's the first name that pops into your head ? Call me Nathan . Why are you doing this for me ? { \ * I mean , You 're } Taking me in , hiding me { \ * from the police } . - You don 't even know me . - Of course I do . You may not realize it , but you 're a man of great powers . Powers ? { \ * Last night } At the police station , I raised my hand and somehow threw a man across a room . What 's wrong with me ? There 's nothing wrong . You 're special . Take a look around . Here , everyone is . Hey , Teddy , show him what you can do . - You mean everybody here ... - Is like you . Like us . Lydia ! Come meet our new friend . Show him around a bit , will you ? I think you { \ * two } are gonna like each other . My pleasure . What is it ? I remember shaking a lot of hands . Like a I was a politician or something . Is that possible ? I suppose anything is possible . Come on . Hi . Laundry day . Is this a bad time ? No ... come on in . How goes job hunting ? Unproductive . Well , hang in there . It 'll work out . Thank you . Can I have some quarters ? I need , like , 12 of them . Yeah , sure . Over there in the jar . Help yourself . Don 't take this the wrong way , but have you ever thought about doing a little volunteer work ? Oh , wait ... Peter ? How did you get in the bathroom ? It 's been a long time since I 've teleported . I need you to deliver some tickets . " Captain Lubbock , Baltimore P. D. " Isn 't this the guy who was hunting Sylar last night ? Something is very wrong . The memories are returning , but they 're the wrong memories . There 's someone else inside his head . We need to jump-start the real Sylar . Wake the sleeping lion . If the real Sylar sees this cop coming at him , he might kill him . Indeed , he might . Hiro 's dying ? He doesn 't have to if I can find a healer . That 's why I came over here . { \ * noah } I want you to help me locate one . What about my blood ? Can 't we give him a transfusion ? { \ * Can 't you take me back with you , we can give him a blood transfusion ? } That won 't work . A tumor is living tissue . Your blood 's regenerative powers would only make it grow faster . But there was a kid , bag-and-tag of three to four years ago . How long does he have ? { \ Hard to tell . } It could be a couple months . Could be a couple hours . That 's him . Jeremy Greer . I found him when he was 13 . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } I was getting a report of a kid that was bringing { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } - squashed bugs back to life . - Back from the dead ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } { \ * Well , no , } Not exactly . But if just a leg still twitching . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } All he had to do was touch them and away they would fly . We studied him for four days and , of course , erased his memory . He was a good kid . Or he wanted to be . He couldn 't decide if his power was a gift or a curse . Well , if he can save Hiro , it 's definitely a gift . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Cainan , Georgia . - You ready ? - Yeah . Samuel 's brother , Joseph , began the tradition of morning chores . He believed that hard work helped bind a community together . { \ * Well , } I 'm certainly looking forward to getting my hands dirty . I haven 't done an honest day 's work since ... { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Since I can 't remember when . It 's nice having you here . We don 't see a new face among us that often . Especially one so handsome . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } How you doing ? That Lydia ... always had a thing for bad boys . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } - What do you mean ? - I 've heard about you , Sylar . How you steal powers from other people . How I ... I 'm sorry , { \ * man , } I { \ * literally } have no idea what you 're talking about . I 'm sure you can do some fancy tricks . But you know what , I have some tricks of my own . Excuse me . Those are kind of in the way . { \ pos ( 230,260 ) } Are you gonna stop this ? Boys will be boys . Why don 't we let the others finish up here ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } There 's someone I 'd like you to meet . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } It 's so strange when that happens . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } My hand { \ * just } rises up and can suddenly do { \ * these } incredible things , like motor memory . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } Memories don 't only exist in the mind . The body retains everything . I remember flying . - You mean flying in a plane . - No , I mean , like piloting a jet . I flew jets in the military , maybe . A politician 's life , jet pilot . It all sounds like a very exciting life . But it isn 't yours . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } Someone 's done something to you . Polluted your mind somehow . { \ pos ( 250,180 ) } I thought your { \ * true } memories would return on their own , { \ * but } it 's just not happening . You want to know who you really are { \ * don 't you } ? Of course I do . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } Then it 's time for stronger measures . Damian . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } This is Damian . He has a powerful gift . { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } In his hands , your true memories will be returned . Are you ready to know the truth ? Take him to the house of mirrors . Go away . I have no more blood left . No more blood . Blood ? I 'm sorry ... I ... I read lips , but yours move differently . Sorry . Japanese accent . - I 'm Emma . - I 'm Hiro . Peter Petrelli said I could ask you questions about my ... Abilities . You have a power ? How can I make it stop ? No , manifesting a power is a wondrous time . A hero never refuses the call . I 'm deaf . I can 't hear the call . You must have many questions . Just one . How do I turn it off ? It 's not a light switch . It 's part of who you are . Sorry to have bothered you . Dead plants , dead bushes . Not exactly what you 'd expect from a healer , huh ? - { \ * So } What do you know about this kid ? - { \ * Well , } Not much . You know , I tested him . I wrote up a report , threw it in the file . But ... The kid was { \ * just } coming into his ability . He had a lot of questions , so ... Naturally we wiped his memory , Sent him back to his messed up family . And I went on to my next assignment . The company wasn 't { \ * never what you 'd call } a support group . - It 's the powers , not the people . { \ * Yeah , More about powers , less about the people . } - It 's right . But you saw him heal , right ? Yeah . Bugs . Dog that got hit by a car . Day four I slashed my arm pretty bad . The kid touched it , it was good as new . Guess his power doesn 't work on birds . - That smells like ... - Death . Hello ? Is anybody home ? Hello ? Oh ... Noah . Noah . - The parents . - What the hell happened here ? There was a case in china . This woman manifested as a healer , But as time went on , it evolved into something very different . There was a flip side . She could control the flow of life ... give it ... Or take it away ? Yeah . Jeremy ? Jeremy , is that you ? Gabriel . - Hello , Gabriel . - Mom ? Oh , my god . Oh , my god , no ! No , this isn 't me . This isn 't me . Why are you doing this to me ? Make it stop , please ! Make it stop ! So tell me about your ability . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I have an ability too . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I am the master of time and space . Well , I was . Lately , time and space has been the master of me . Oh , is that my brain scan ? No . Mine . I see sounds . They make colors . A new ability can be frightening . But you must not turn away from it . I want it to stop . - { \ * I don 't think } He 's not shooting to kill { \ * , Noah } . - He 's just warning us to stay away . Still , we 're talking about a scared kid with a small cannon in his hands . - { \ * All right , } I 'm going up . - No . I need to talk to him . - There 's a staircase out back , though . - { \ * Yeah . } I 'm on it . Jeremy , I 'm coming upstairs . Unarmed . I 'm not gonna hurt you . Talk to me { \ * , Jeremy } . Say something . Stay away , all right . I 'm warning you ! { \ * No , } I 'm coming upstairs , { \ * So } If you 're gonna shoot , lock and load . I told you to keep away ! Why ? What happens if I { \ * come near you } don 't ? Everything I touch ends up dead . Captain Lubbock . I 'm Samuel Sullivan . Glad { \ * to see you and } your family could make it . I appreciate you sending those tickets over this morning . But a gotta ask . Why me ? We always try and do something special for local law enforcement . I heard about you on the news { \ * last night } . Out chasing down some escaped prisoner ? You 'll indulge me . I ' { \ * ve been } m showing this to everyone I can . - { \ * Got } A lot of people on the hunt for him { \ * this one } . - Don 't think I 've seen him . But I could be wrong . A lot of folks come and go around here . If you spot him , call me right away . I absolutely will . Enjoy the carnival . Mrs. Lubbock . Stop . Make it stop . Please ... Please . Oh , my God . Oh , God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! This isn 't me ! Please make it stop ! No , this can 't be me . Please make it ... - { \ * Tell me } What happened ? - Don 't come any closer ! Okay , I 'm right here . { \ * What happened to } Your parents ? I killed them . I was angry . I just touched them , and they died . - I didn 't mean to do it . - I know you didn 't . You know , what 's happened to you , Jeremy , it 's not fair . You never should have been left to suffer through this alone . And who are you ? You don 't remember me . But we 've met . I know { \ * you . I know } all about you . I know about your power . I know that you 're not a killer . You 're a healer . I used to heal things . And then it turned . And now I kill ! No , you 're still a healer . - You can do both . - Stop . If you come one step closer , I swear to God I will shoot you ! Stay with me . Stay with me . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } - Oh , my God . - He 's bleeding out . { \ pos ( 200,220 ) } He 's never gonna make it to the hospital . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } You need to heal him . I can 't . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Yes , you can { \ * , Jeremy } . I 've seen it with my own eyes . You need to come over here and lay your hands on him now ! - If I touch him , he 'll die . - He 'll die if you don 't . You can do this . Listen to me . My power is understanding people like you . That 's what I do . What happened to your parents never has to happen again . You can control it , and you can heal him . Everything I touch dies . I 'm touching you right now . You can do this . You can give life . Come on . Focus , Jeremy . Visualize Peter healing . Imagine what it 's gonna look like when the wound disappears , his eyes open again , and he is healthy and alive . Picture it , Jeremy . Keep that thought in your mind . Welcome back . And now , to assist Hiro the magnificent , please welcome to the stage Emma the ... also magnificent ! - Hiro , what are you doing ? - Magic . And we are going to need much applause for the next feat of magicalness . I will make Emma ... disappear ! - It 's like time is ... - Standing still . It 's all so beautiful . There are no bad powers Emma . You just have to understand them . And when you do , you will learn to use your powers to do good things in the world . But please , for now , our magic trick . Hide behind the curtains . Over there . Where did she go ? Where is Emma ? Where are you ? There she is ! A big applause for Emma the magnificent ! But we have to give applause in a different way . Like this . All those murders ... All those memories in my mind ... But I cannot believe that they 're mine . How many did I kill ? A dozen ? Two dozen ? I 'm sorry for your pain . - Truth can be difficult . - Difficult ? I am a monster ! I stalk people and slash open their skulls . Has it ever occurred to you to question what brought you here ? Why providence has seen fit for our paths to cross ? This place is a safe , protected womb . { \ * But } Out there 's a cruel world filled with people who persecute our kind . { \ * Can 't you see , } They made you what you are , { \ * They } turned you into a monster . - That makes it okay ? - It makes it the truth ! You wanted to know who you are . And now you do . The question now is : Where are you gonna go from here ? Do you wallow in self-pity , or do you learn to use the gifts God gave you and command fear . And respect , and defend against those who would do us harm ? All in the embrace of a community who loves you for exactly who you are . You just met me . You would take me in here ... Knowing what I 've done , and who I am ? We 're family . Family accepts . Family forgives . There 's a problem . That policeman who was hunting you , he 's here . It 's not just about you anymore , we 're harboring a criminal now . - What do you want me to do ? - I can 't make that decision for you . But your presence here puts all of us in jeopardy . Something has to be done . Where is he ? One of my men saw him going into the house of mirrors . I don 't know what to do with him . A leash ? A cage ? Maybe a cattle prod . Now ... You keep your Japanese tush in this bed ! I 'm not a pet . She 's right , Hiro . You 're sick . You need to stop using your power before it kills you . But my power isn 't killing me . It keeps me alive . When I was stuck in my cubicle every day ... wasting my life , that 's when I was dying . How can you be so focused helping others , knowing what it might cost ? I had a friend once . She knew she was dying but , that didn 't push her off her path . She told me to keep joy and dignity alive , even in the face of death . Her name was Charlie . Oh , my god . I can 't believe I left her off the list . What ? What are you doing ? Paper and pen , stat . I had a list . A list of all the wrongs I have to right before I die . I can 't believe I forgot her . Promise me you won 't leave until Peter returns . There 's been an accident at 2627 Otsego . Please send the police and the coroner . Did you get his ability ? So what next ? { \ * Well , } There 's an air field about six miles south of here off the highway . I called in a favor and I got you a ride . It 's not as fast as how you came , but ... - You 're not coming with ? - No . All right , better hurry . Hiro 's waiting . Okay , so , I jerry-rigged the heater . And I backed up the vent . It 's gonna look like carbon monoxide poisoning , OK ? You came home and you found them . All right ? You 're staying here ? - Yeah . - How long ? Till I know that you 're all right . Jeremy , it used to be my job to watch over people like you . But somehow I ... I lost my way . I dropped the ball . You may not know it , but I let you down . Come on . Hands above your head ... Now . You need to leave here , now . While there 's still time . I got a better idea . You resist arrest , then I have an excuse . I 'm just trying to save you . What are you ? Don 't just stand there , get a mop ! - That was beautiful . - You promised you would stay in bed . Joy and dignity in the face of death . Just like Charlie . Come on , back to bed . You 're safe now . Tonight ... We welcome a new brother into our family . He will live and work among us ... And will be welcome here ... all the rest of our days . There , there , Edgar , don 't pout . Good thing I followed that bastard . I { \ * had a feeling } knew he wouldn 't follow through . He 's just a baby learning how to walk . What use is he to us like this ? What use is a lion that can 't kill ? Maybe it 's better this way . We just make a better sylar . And when we do ... He 'll be ours forever . Emma , I 'm sorry it took so long . How is he ? - { \ * Hiro 's } Gone . - What ? He disappeared . Just disappeared . " Save Charlie . "

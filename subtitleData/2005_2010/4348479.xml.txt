 Ladies and gentlemen , we will soon be starting our in-flight movie . We will be coming through with headsets , which are available for purchase for $ 4 . And , of course , exact change is always appreciated . Just water , please . You need some headsets ? You should put keys on your back . - Excuse me ? - It 's an old wives ' tale . - To stop the bloody nose . - Yeah ? Actually , I tried it once . It doesn 't work . It 's all bull . Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me . I need to talk to you . - I 'll be with you in one moment . - No , now ! Please . I 'll be right back . - What 's the problem ? - I 'm in trouble . Something 's happening I don 't have the time or permission to explain . - What is it ? - You need to listen to me very carefully . Go to the passengers . Collect as many sedatives or tranquilizers as you can . Okay , I need you to take a deep breath . This isn 't a panic attack . This is real . We will die , all of us , if you don 't do what I say . A threat like that is in violation of FAA reg ... - Does it look like I care about that ? - Oh , my God . I need you to get those drugs for me . Do you have any weapons ? A gun . Go call the captain . I need you to calm down , you 're gonna scare the passengers . They should be . What weapons do you have ? - It 's Melissa . - What weapons ? We have a man claiming ... A Taser in the cockpit , which I 'll use if you don 't calm down . A Taser won 't do a thing . It 'll just piss me off . He wants drugs , but he seems to be on something already . I need you to do what I say . I 'm going into that bathroom . You keep me in there . You keep that door closed . Get whatever sedatives as soon as you can . - You go in that bathroom , sir . - I am not messing around . When you get the drugs , you come back , you knock . If I don 't answer , or if I do and what you see isn 't me anymore you keep that door closed . You hear me ? You keep me in there , away from the other passengers . Get the drugs . Quick . Yes , sir . I 'll do that . Yes , sir , but I think 40 minutes is too long . Ladies and gentlemen , we have a passenger having a hard time . Please remain calm , everything 's gonna be just fine . - What 's he doing in there ? - I don 't know . He just got quiet . Maybe he passed out . The captain says we should restrain him , but I 've only ... Seat belts . Seat belts . Well , hello . Look , Aunt Liv , I 'm beautiful . Yes , you are beautiful . Yes , you 're beautiful , but why don 't we put this down and take these off ? Come here , give me ... What else do you have here ? I 'll take that . All right . - Go wash that off , okay ? - Okay . - Sorry . - Oh , please , it 's fine . Do you remember when we had that sleepover at Aunt Missy 's and you found the perfume and then poured it all over ... Was it Lola ? No , Lola was the hamster . Roxy was the dog . Liv , what is this ? Is this Mom 's ? " Always . " This isn 't Mom 's . No . It 's from John . John . Your partner John ? - Yeah . - You told me that you guys were ... He asked you to marry him ? No . He didn 't . It was a mistake . Suffice to say that it never actually happened . - Uh , no , you can 't do that . - I have to . I am your sister and I have told you every excruciating detail of my failed marriage . - There 's nothing you can tell ... - He was a traitor . The people he was working with , I still don 't know who they were . But whoever they were , he was bad . And whatever was between us was a lie . So that he could gain my trust so that I didn 't see him for what he was . God , Liv . - I 'm so sorry . - Yeah . Me too . And I thought Greg was a jerk . Well , Greg is a jerk . Yeah . Greg is a jerk . Hello ? Where ? Flight 718 went down a little after 6 p.m. Witnesses say the plane just fell out of the sky . Once we recover the black box we 'll know more . So why are we here ? Shouldn 't NTSB be taking point ? Air-traffic control got a distress call from the pilot , but it was cut off . What happened , I 'm guessing , has to do with what I 'm about to show you . It 's burned badly . Forensics thought it was an animal at first . They were mistaken . No one 's ever seen an animal like this . I can understand their confusion . This creature has pelage characteristic of an animal . And yet ... I will say this . Our friend here didn 't start out this way . Hey , Liv . - Hey . - Hey . Copies of the manifest and passports . There 's 147 passengers . Gonna be a long few days for the poor folks tasked to identify the remains . So is there anyone of any interest ? Not at first glance , no . The elder Bishop , does he have any ideas about that ? Not yet . Or if he does he isn 't saying . So the official word right now is engine failure . The pilot tried to bring it in for an emergency landing . The landing gear failed to engage . The pilot lost control . The way this thing works . What it does to you . Horror show . Far worse than you can imagine . I 'm telling you , this stuff ... It 's a horror show , John . - What ? You find something ? - Yeah . I think this is our guy . - The fried dog-man ? - Yeah . Marshall Bowman . We need to pull everything we can find on him . How can you know that ? Call it my gut . Your gut . I would expect whatever caused this mutation would 've completely altered his internal organs . The kidneys appear normal . It also gave him four extra nipples . - Maybe he mutated into a possum . - No , possums have 15 mammaries . Unlike most mammals , who have an even number of nipples hence the one-half rule regarding nipples . - The one-half nipple rule ? - You just had to ask , didn 't you ? The typical number of young in a litter is usually equal to half the number of nipples on the animal . The number of nipples being the maximum litter size . Humans , for example . One child is the typical . Maximum , twins . Barring extraordinary cases , when the young far exceed the number of nipples . God , I hope I never have to hear him say the word " nipple " again . Evidence of an extradural hematoma . Possibly epistaxis . Meaning he had a colossal nosebleed . I know . Hmm . There 's something hard inside here . Scalpel . Forceps . What is it ? A tumor ? Not unless a tumor is made of glass . I need someone over at VertusAir right now . Yes , this is about 718 . Went through all the reports , breakdowns . Here 's everything on Bowman . Forty-two years old . Worked out of Credit Cotier in Marseilles . Managed their corporate accounts . Has Dr. Bishop been able to make a positive ID yet ? No . Contact the bank , see what they can tell us . Done . Back of the file are Bowman 's U.S. clients . He outdid himself this time . He 's gonna get impatient to sell it off . So you have to get the money lined up fast . What ? Olivia , you okay ? People , we got something . Simmons , patch me in through public address . Wilson sent over the black-box recording . Last 60 seconds of the flight . Play it . New York Center , this is VertusAir 718 heavy . We have a report that there ... Tower to VertusAir 718 . Other aircraft calling . Say again . Purser 's reporting a disturbance in the main cabin . There ... It 's trying to get in . New York , we need an emergency ... 718 ... We have something onboard . It 's already killed at least three ... God . Hold that back . That 's it . Tech is trying to recover more . Let 's get back to work , people . Charlie . Come here a second . See this guy ? Daniel Hicks . He owns an import-export company based in Chelsea . He 's the guy that Marshall Bowman was flying in to meet . So we need to bring him in for questioning . This your gut again ? What 's going on , Liv ? This is gonna sound insane . Let 's just put it in the category of " crazy things happen in Walter Bishop 's lab . " Okay . John Scott and I shared consciousness . Our minds were connected through a procedure before he died . Some of his memories are still in my head . - His memories . - And sometimes I get flashes . I see what he saw in the memory . In one of these flashes I saw him with Marshall Bowman . And this guy . Hicks . I think they were all working together . - On what ? - I don 't know . A weapon sale of some kind . Okay . I 'll bring him in . That 's it ? Despite the thousand questions I have in my head right now I 'm gonna bite my tongue . Thank you . - Bishop 's house of horrors . - Hey . How we doing ? Good . We got the blood work back . You were right . It is Marshall Bowman . - Anything else ? - Yeah . Walter seems to think he was dosed with some kind of designer virus . So it was intentional . Hard to say it was an accident . Stuff doesn 't exist in nature . Whoever did it would have a deep understanding of cutting-edge genetics . I mean , it completely rewrote Bowman 's DNA . If the plane hadn 't crashed , he wouldn 't have survived the transformation . There 's something else , under the heading of " What the hell ? " But we found something in his left hand . Here , I 'll stream it to you . It 's a glass disk about the size of a nickel . I don 't believe it . We found a similar disk on the DEA agent a few months back . I thought you told me Bowman was a banker . Now you 're telling me he 's some kind of agent ? I don 't know . Charlie 's bringing in a guy who might be able to give us answers . Tell us about your business , Mr. Hicks . My business . It 's import and export . But you know that already . You just came from my office . Why don 't you indulge us , Mr. Hicks ? What do you import and export ? Furniture , mostly . Mostly French , 18th and 19th century . Look , I 'd like to know what this is all about . I run a clean business . How do you know Marshall Bowman ? He 's my banker , overseas . Why , has he gotten into some kind of trouble ? This is wonderful , don 't you agree ? It 's just like a good detective movie . Mr. Hicks . Have you heard what happened on Flight 718 ? Yeah , that 's the plane that crashed , right ? Mm-hm . This may be hard to recognize , but this is Marshall Bowman . He was onboard that plane . I ... I ... I don 't understand . I believe you do , Mr. Hicks . I believe you know how that happened . I believe that you and Marshall Bowman conspired to distribute a deadly virus and this is the unintended result . Look , I think you have me mistaken for someone else . Your nose is bleeding . Can we have a box of tissues , please ? No . No , tissues won 't help . Get me some sedatives . Now . I need help . Walter , what 's happening ? I suspect the same thing that happened to that man in the airplane . I may be able to suspend the process . No , not yet . Not until he talks . - Please . - You want help ? I want answers . We must have been dosed . I wanna know the name . Who dosed you ? Conrad . Oh , I don 't think that 's working . I checked the DHS database . Nothing on a Conrad first or last name when cross-referenced with Daniel Hicks . Well , so far there 's no mention of a Conrad in John 's old files either . Hmm . Why don 't you let me take a turn ? Thank you . - Anything ? - Yes . As often is the case , there 's good news and bad news . He is transforming , but I placed him in a medically induced coma to slow the process . - Which is that , the good or the bad ? - Huh ? - Which is it , the good news or the bad ? - That 's the bad news . The good news is that I have already synthesized a preliminary sample of an antidote . I 'm testing it on tissue samples as we speak . And a watermelon . As a control group . And will it be ready in time ? Depends on your definition of time . If you mean before he turns into a beast I wouldn 't wager on it , no . Wonderful . Cut open his hand . - What ? - I wanna see if there 's a disk in it . Like Bowman 's . I like cutting . - Where did you get these ? - One of them was in Bowman 's palm . The other one was on Hicks . We 've seen one of these before . Did the NSA ever determine what it was for ? A data-storage device . Apparently used to transport information . I want authorization to exhume John Scott 's body . John Scott ? I think he may have one on him too . I think he was working with Bowman and Hicks . - I 'm afraid that won 't be possible . - Make it possible . - Excuse me . - Look , I know it 's against protocol but I don 't give a damn . - Stop . - If you don 't ask Harris , I 'll ask myself . - I said , stop . You can 't dig up John Scott 's body . And that other disk , it didn 't go to the NSA . Where did it go ? One advantage of being the Defense Department 's biggest contractor : Massive Dynamic has money to develop technologies generations beyond that of the U.S. government . When we were unable to retrieve the information , I requested Nina 's help . I suspect you telling me this isn 't the only reason we 're here . Agent Dunham . Ms. Sharp . For what it 's worth , it was not my decision to keep this from you . As you suspected , we discovered a disk identical to the others embedded in Agent Scott 's hand . While he may appear to be alive , I assure you he is not . We 've kept him in a suspended state because we believe that the information stored in the disks self-destructs when the disk 's host dies . We attempted to utilize Agent Scott 's body his blood , his DNA , to try to retrieve the data . The small amount of information we were able to gather seems to implicate Agent Scott as part of a bioterrorist cell . There were also references to a Conrad . We believe he 's a scientist . Designing chemical and biological weapons for sale on the black market . CIA 's received scattered intel on him in the past . Nothing concrete . We don 't even know his full name . So a plane full of people are dead and our best lead is nothing ? A chemist whose name we don 't even know . It gets worse . Three hours ago , French intelligence relayed to D.C an informant claims a major weapon sale is about to go down in Chicago . However , what the informant was unable to say is exactly where or when the sale is going to take place . What the informant did know is that the man behind the sale is known as Conrad . - Hello ? - I 'm on my way back . Is Walter there ? Yeah , why ? I just got word that Conrad 's planning on selling this virus . - What ? When ? - I don 't know . If I 'm right and John was working with these guys he has the answer . In his memory . Which means that it 's in mine . - Olivia , you know how dangerous this is . - Tell Walter to prep the tank . I 'm going back in . - You okay ? - Yeah . Be careful . We 're online . All right . - Olivia . Can you hear me ? - Yes . You must listen to my voice at all times . It is your connection , your lifeline . Understood ? Understood . I am going to try and guide you through John Scott 's memory in an attempt to take you back to the place where he met our comatose friend here , Mr. Hicks . Now , picture yourself at the top of a steep flight of stairs . As you descend , step by step you will become progressively more and more relaxed . Now here come the last five steps . Four . Three . Two . One . - Where are you ? - I 'm in a bedroom . No , it 's not a bedroom . This is where we used to meet . John and I. Oh , man . This is crazy . - Absolutely . This 'll never happen again . - No , never . - Ask her what she sees . - What do you see ? Me and John . Don 't worry , he can 't see you . Remember , you 're observing a memory . I 'll be right back . Hey , Liv . Olivia , what 's happening ? - John 's talking to me . - That 's not possible , Olivia . He can 't see you . We 'll try to take you elsewhere , where John and his accomplices met . - Don 't move . - Liv , what 's wrong ? Stop . Don 't . Don 't move . Olivia , focus on the sound of my voice . I said stay there . - I miss you . - Don 't move . I 'm gonna ask you a question , you 're gonna give me the answer . You were working with a man named Conrad . He developed a biological weapon . I wanna know who he is and who he 's planning on selling it to . - Liv , put the gun ... - Stop lying to me , John . I know you were part of a terrorist cell . We have your partner in custody . Hicks , he 's dying . And Bowman is already dead . They were infected with some kind of a virus . - Liv ... - No ! - What just happened ? - I don 't know . We need to get her out . We need to get her out , now . It 's too dangerous . She 's too far in . We need to reconnect before we pull her out . Olivia , can you hear me ? Olivia . Olivia , can you hear me ? Olivia ? Walter ? Olivia . I want answers , John . There he is . - Who ? - Conrad . He 's a monster , Liv . Capable of creating horrible things weapons which he does for no other reason than because he can . Because he 's curious . And he sells them to the highest bidder . That 's him . And that 's me . The problem was we were hunting a man none of us had ever seen before . If I had known I had him in my sights , I could 've taken him out right there . It was my most important mission and I failed . I let that monster get away . I didn 't know it was him . What mission ? Who were you working for ? Bowman and Hicks . The truth is they were , they are , government agents . NSA , a secret task force . And so was I. I don 't believe you . - It 's the truth , Liv . - No , not again . If you want me to believe you , you need to prove it to me . I can 't . Liv , it 's black ops , a deniable operation . If we 're to take out Conrad , there can be no record of our involvement . That 's why I could never tell you , even though I wanted to . If that 's the truth , then help me . - Tell me where the sale 's going down . - What sale ? The virus . We believe that Conrad 's planning on selling it . I don 't know what 's going on inside Conrad 's organization . Hicks would know . You need to talk to Hicks . He was privy to that information . - He has it ... - John ? - John ? - Liv , trust Hicks . He can help you . John ? John ? - John ? - We have to pull her out . - John ? - Prepare 30 cc 's of dextroamphetamine . - Hi , Peter . - You 're okay . You 're gonna be fine . I understand . Thanks for checking . My contact at NSA couldn 't confirm a single thing John said . Of course . John said they wouldn 't be able to . That 's the perfect alibi , one that you can 't confirm . Yeah . How 's it coming ? His cell sample 's membranes still aren 't absorbing the inhibiter . We don 't know if the antidote 's working yet . But it might . We could try it and see . You wanna wake up Hicks , even though he could transform just like Bowman did ? Conrad could be selling this virus . Hicks can tell us how this is gonna go down . And you 're willing to take John 's word that you can trust Hicks ? It finally happened . I 'm now referring to a dead guy who exists only in your mind . Boy . I need another bag of midazolam right away . What if he 's still lying to you ? Have you considered that ? If Hicks and John were working with Conrad then maybe John is using you to tip Conrad off . Or even worse , to get you killed . This is a bad idea , Olivia . My mother always says I stick my nose in places it does not belong . I know we haven 't known each other that long but you are one of the best judges of character I 've ever met . What 's your instinct ? When you were with John , when you were looking into his eyes was he for real ? Prep Hicks . Ready or not , we 're administering the antidote . An experiment . How exhilarating . This is Agent Dunham . I need to talk to Broyles . Sorry to wake you . Little worse than adrenaline except , perhaps , lice , which is a nightmare . Mr. Hicks , try and breathe normally . Can you hear me ? This is an antidote . While I can 't guarantee it will actually work I do have a recorded IQ of ... - One-ninety-six . - Really ? We know about the work you were doing with John Scott . Now we need your help . For those not in the know information has come to us about a weapons buy . The same virus responsible for Flight 718 . I know this label gets slapped on pretty much all we do but preventing this transaction from taking place is our highest priority . The prospective buyer landed in the United States this morning 0700 hours , O 'Hare Airport , and we were there . That suspect is now in custody , and no surprise to anyone refuses to cooperate . But we do have someone else in custody : An informant with extensive information on the players we 'll be dealing with . His name is Daniel Hicks , and he has agreed to relay all necessary information to Agent Dunham using an encrypted , untraceable two-way radio which we implanted this afternoon . Agent Francis will coordinate surveillance . The informant disclosed the meet is scheduled for 1600 hours at the Fairchild Hotel , Room 1021 . The seller , a man known as Conrad , will not be there but his intermediaries will . We have agents standing by to move in in corresponding rooms . Per regulations , no raid will be ordered until Agent Dunham has visual on the weapon . When she does , she 'll give the go signal . - That signal will be ? - " Christmas . " We all look forward to see how she works that into conversation . Okay , people . Let 's get it done . Listen up . Spotted the seller . The seller is making a phone call . Stand by . You didn 't have to come with me , you know . Shady deals with shady guys in shady hotels is my m.o. Typically , if someone is gonna kill you , it 's a good idea to have an ally in the room . - I 'm not scared . Being fearless doesn 't mean you 're being safe . - Astrid , how are we doing ? - Hey . Hicks is onboard and ready to go . I 'm putting you on speaker . So far , so good , Olivia . Blood pressure 140 / 90 , not bad considering 3 cc 's of adrenaline . Are they gonna expect bona fides ? - Hicks , tell me what I need to know . - Well , they 're gonna be suspicious . Why they 've never seen you before . You tell them you used to work with Anderson . Anderson , okay , got it . What else ? Tell them Ernesto flew in for the meeting but he got called back to the basement and he couldn 't come . What ? Called back to the basement ? Just say it , he 'll understand . You 're not messing with me , are you ? You trusted John Scott , right ? Then trust me . He 's on the move . Seller 's heading inside . That 's him . Here we go . Liv , you be careful . You 're Gavin . Susan , I used to work with Anderson . I was expecting someone else . Ernesto flew in , but he was called back to the basement , so he couldn 't make it . Who 's he ? Who are they ? We 'll sweep you and get to business . Good . She 's clean . The money , please . Just a formality , I assure you . It will only take a moment . Have we met before ? You look familiar . - Did you work with Anderson too ? - He 's testing you . You tell him Peter met Anderson at New College at Oxford . They met at Oxford . New College . Isn 't that right ? What does it matter to you where I met anyone ? Where did you meet , on campus ? Where they met ? I 'm sorry , I don 't know that . I don 't know where exactly it was . We met at the White Horse on Wheatley Road . You know it ? I don 't recall . You would . Thai food , it 's fantastic . I could tell you what each of us was wearing if you want to hear it . Where the hell did he come up with that ? I have no idea . It 's all here . Have a seat . I have to admit , I was skeptical that you 'd come at all . Well , of course we came . I thought it would be Paris all over again . That was because of the French intelligence report and he knows it . That was because of the French intelligence report . You know that . True . But this is a larger purchase . Hello ? Okay . Conrad would like to see you . - When ? - Now . He 's on his way . What 's going on ? Do they have the package ? - Why isn 't she calling the raid ? - Conrad 's coming . - So what ? - So she doesn 't wanna scare him off . She wants to get him . She 's waiting for Conrad . We 've included this with the purchase . It 's a reverse-mutator . An antidote . It would take you years to reverse-engineer an antivirus . It 's why the purchase price is so high . The formula itself is deceiving in its complexity . We shouldn 't have a need for that . It 's only in case of accidental exposure . Which , I assure you , would be fatal . Now , why wouldn 't Ernesto call me back himself and tell me someone else was coming to meet ? Uh-oh . Oh , God . A tranquilizer , quick . It 's happening to him . Hicks is transforming . Well ? Well , how would I know ? I 'm not Ernesto 's mother . At least tell me who he was meeting . Quickly . Quickly . What the hell is going on ? I asked you a simple question . Who was Ernesto meeting ? I need a name . Somebody , anybody else in your operation . Oh , no . Oh , God . Hicks is out . I 'll ask you again . Who was your colleague meeting ? Sir , should we move in ? Okay . That 's enough . Now , just tell him . Tell him . I 'm not getting greased over Ernesto 's secret . What secret is that ? - Shut your mouth . - Ernesto is sick . He 's dying sick , okay ? He just doesn 't want anybody to know . Damn it , Liv . Give the signal . - What is wrong with you ? He asked ... - I got a gun in my face . Both of you , shut up ! - Get that out of my face , I 'm telling you . - Gavin . - Who are these people ? - According to them , Ernesto 's sick . It 's true . He found out the day before Christmas . I spoke to Ernesto this morning . He 's fine . Kill them both right now . FBI ! Put the gun down ! Put the gun down ! Hands on the table . Get down . Get your face down ! Nobody move ! - Check the other room . - Stay down ! Put your hands behind your back . John Scott says hi . Turns out Conrad 's a French citizen . Conrad Etienne Moreau . Wanted in connection with at least half a dozen biological attacks . Those are just the ones we know about . He 's been manufacturing biological weapons and distributing them on the black market for years . And you caught him . I would think you could at least let yourself crack a smile about that . I didn 't do it alone . You know , despite the successful outcome of this case John Scott 's status remains the same . As far as this department is concerned , he was a traitor . Even if he was telling the truth there 's no way to confirm it . That 's all right . I know the truth . And that 's enough . Hello ? Anyone here ? Agent Dunham ? Where is everyone ? They took that gentleman that was here to the hospital to recover . - So the antidote worked . - He started improving almost as soon as I administered it . Which is more than I can say for my own concoction . In any case , I was just about to read a bedtime story . Walter . I was hoping you 'd do me a favor . Even if you did go back in , I 'm dubious you 'd even be able to find him . What do you mean ? Your brain-wave patterns are returning to normal . Your mind is finally succeeding in purging itself of Agent Scott . Even if you could reconnect , it would be for seconds , minutes at best . And then you would never see him again . Then we need to do this now . It 's beautiful out here , isn 't it ? We caught him today . - Conrad . - Really ? I 'm sorry that I doubted you . I should 've trusted you . No , it wasn 't your fault . I always meant to tell you . I guess I ran out of time . There was one other thing . I know we can 't ever be together . Not really . Maybe I won 't know the difference . I love you , Liv . I love you too .

View excellence , performance and loyalty ' alliance , The Council approves his request for service in this field . The commend for his great contribution . It ' a priority mission . Thank you , gentlemen , and ' an honor to serve the cause . We have received news that traitors Alliance Intend to meet in neutral zone . We fear that the military might reveal information to the Aquarian . I understand , Madam . Sara ' sent to Earth 219 , to intercept the traitors . For the operation , and ' important that she is not peeled . It ' very dangerous that the military , violin a galactic Treaty . But , we have no choice . For this reason , I go ' alone . Respond ' directly to Lieutenant Commander Thaine . I will not have ' contacts with anyone , until the end of the mission . Good luck , Captain . What the spirits of the fallen before her Can protect it on its way . The Alliance will be ' happy to see you return safely . Thank you , Lord . Ready , Captain ? I 'd be better if I could put this thing in the hold for the journey . But why do I need a survival suit ? We do not know what might happen in the neutral zone . These beauties are the greatest . If any fish head would blow up the ship , You could go back without a scratch . What the hell 's going on ' behind them ? No ... sorry , I was just checking the systems . I forgot to turn off the sensors . Not happen ' more ' . Hey ... Anyway , where is ' Rasha ? Level 4 . Secret It ' been reassigned . It happens when you grade salt . The kind of things that turn you into a jerk ? Promotion or not , the rest still your commanding officer . I could send you to Court Martial for this . It ' just what I was talking about , man . I thought I had left a long time ago Shelly . I did . But , as after the attack on Earth , I feel it was wrong to leave her . You made his choices ... And you did yours . We all make our choices . You can use your access codes And give me a copy of the list of survivors ? I just wanna know if she 's okay . The lighthouse ' , Captain . I want to see on my return . Night Crawler to Command . Here Night Crawler to Command , You receive ? Passage . Do we receive , Night Crawler . Passage . Report . They are on time and on target . I 'm entering the neutral zone directly toward Earth 219 , over . Well . The screens are free ? Passage . I ' , I do not have company . Free Screens I repeat , clear screens . I close . Here Night Crawler , mayday , I 'm falling . The guidance system and ' out of order . Rush on the surface , they have no control . Be ' , this suit and served to something . Night Crawler , do you read me . Reply , Crawler . Night Crawler to Command . Night Crawler to Command . I 'm fine . Report , over . Report ... It ' something exploded in the rear reactors , And fried guidance system , there is not much . Night Crawler , six ' , pitch them ? Night Crawler to Command , on ... on ... That , and ' exploded the antenna cock . Automated message from the central computer . The order and ' activate the suit . Received . 7 ... 1 ... 6 ... 2 . Jordan , are you okay ? You ' , Thaine , do not tell me that they are already ' in trouble . You are 60 km from the planned landing point , Captain . Be ' , you know , I wanted to do the scenic ride . Enjoy the view . You radio contact when you are near the target . Then action is also receive information . - Good luck , I close . - Wait ... repeat ... Step ... confirm acquired target . The broadcast signal and ' lost . This was not necesario . What it was unnecessary ? Feel gruesome voices in his head . E ' part of the program It ' , not ' a program . It ' a mission . - And I 'm here to do a job . - I am here to do a job . Great , stuck on a planet with a synthetic parrot . Dann ... Damn . Damn ! No need for additional materials . I will give you ' what ' it needs . It was not something I needed . It was ... never mind . Look , I do not go to this planet , without my equipment . Inside the suit , she and ' totally isolated From all external elemeni . Ok . - Scanner . - The device does not and ' utility ' . My system and ' equipped with 245 different types of software research . Ok , fine . What about the food ? No external substance can ' penetrate the suit , once activated . What ... what ? And how should I eat , stupid ? - Are you hungry ? - I ' , I 'm hungry , cock . What the hell was that ? 4 hours of nutrients . The cease his hunger ' in 2 minutes . If ' so ' that you feed me , better to hunger . - It hurts . - In memory I have their usual diet . Not the will ' hurt more than it usually eats . It must be a joke . Gentlemen ... Captain Strider and ' arrived on 219 . unharmed . - The suit and ' turned on ? - Yes Madam . Keep a close eye data and bring me back every inconsistency . You ' , lady . - Do you have any physical problem ? - You 're an uninvited guest You 're occupying my head . There are things that I have to focus , 'Cause the mission to succeed . - I need time to think . - You , roughly ranges , 12 hours And 27 minutes , to calculate the tactics to follow . Look , not ' you have another type of voice . More ' pleasant Something ? This ... this shit by robots , is sending me to the insane . You like this ? - It ' s terrible ! - E ' her . It ' like a fireball buzzing in the ears and the brain fuses But , and ' proved that humans like the sound of his own voice . You ' , but when it comes out , and not when ' inside . This is better ? It should be better , but ... We are still far , but we approach Can you give me something a little ' more ' ... Friendly , warm , reassuring ? I think that this is what he wants . We ' , so ' let 's better . Where to go better , Jordan ? No matter . Report . The signal and ' too weak , Lord . There is interference . Enhance transmission . Alert me when you have something . General , Lady . Lieutenant Commander , we receive satisfactory data ? General , we have trouble establishing communications with 7162 . I knew that the secret services say That Terra 219 , has no problem of interstellar transmissions . Okay , lady , I do not think the planet . Are we having problems . I believe are solar flares and star dust to block the signal . Do not pull a guess . Find the problem and solve it . I recommend moving the Persius in coordinates over the static field . Very well , Lieutenant Commander . He has full authority ' to change course . I just hope it 's worth it . It does not look promising . So , what do you think ? The land , within 1 km , has a high concentration of H2O . We 'd better get around Him . The light is falling . A swamp at night and not ' the best place For traveling shipped . Restrict the path to the mainland it reduces the ability ' to march by 62 % . There ' a lot of green here . Water , rain . Must be an O2 system . I can breathe here . I can not confirm . It ' , but the command will do it ' . Night Crawler to Command . Here Night Crawler , do you read , over . I 'm motitorando radio contact since leaving the shuttle . It ' s not been possible to establish contact with the control . We reach the ridge . Perhaps the height help ' transmissions . A few hundred meters , can ' be marginal , Whereas Persius and ' to over 2 billion km from here . You 'll better tell me how to get this thing off me . We have not found ? The field of radiation and 'greater than expected . I calculated the route . It seems that to establish a contact , - We have to touch the neutral zone - There ' time to seek free areas . The suit will indicate 'the road to Jordan . - There ' s something out here . - I readings of 1,674 different species , - Within a radius of 1 km from here . - Be ' , one follows us . And it ' out there . I do not detect intelligent life in our industry . E ' better than an attempt at a joke . - How much farther ? - Reach ' the mainland From 400 meters . Then we get out of here before they do see . - You do not need to stop . - Only I need a break . - So , I 'll take 5 minutes . - His vital signs are normal . She and ' fully operational . I do not feel more ' legs , after going through that shit . - So , I 'll take 10 minutes . - He said 5 . For the mission , and 'imperative to continue . - It does not show signs of fatigue . - Listen ... Can do all the tests you want , But I rest a bit ' , before going ahead . They are equipped to assist in similar situations . My priorities ' , and to keep it moving . - What the hell was that ? - Simolanti , adrenaline . Fight ' fatigue , and he will keep a state of constant attention . Damn ! I 'm tired of this crap . I do not want to be a computer to tell me how to work . E ' normal that the first dose , causes aggressive behavior . Are you that results in aggressive behavior . Violi my space . You can not inject shit in people 's neck . The side effects of the product are overcome by physical advantages . Its benefits help relieve any discomfort . Ok , I 've had enough ! Let me say that , from this point on , I who I command . I , I ! I command ! And , from now on , you will not make any detection or analysis , And not inietterai shit in anyone 's neck , Without my approval . Do you understand ... you understand ? I have to inject substances required by my analysis on your system , - For the fulfillment of the mission . - Very well ! So , go to Camando to say that you sent to the mission whores , And lost in a swamp ass . 'Cause you have not run a direct military order ! Okay ? 'S what you want ? Well , Guisto , great ! - Can not ' stay here ' for a long time . - I 'm not moving ! I do not move ! I suggest you start moving . And I advise you to shut the fuck up ! God , you can not ' have a moment alone ? It ' s not just Captain Strider . You ' obvious , do not you stop talking for the whole dannao day . I am not referring to myself . ... Holy shit ! - What the hell ' ? - E ' exceptionally hostile . Really ? - I said this following us . - The sensors do not detect anything . Check the equipment , you have not even detected them that thing ' . I tried to warn you of the proximity of possible hostile , But she was worried about his need for rest . Someone pulled this , you can not deny it . My sensors indicate that the weapon and ' made of beryllium . One of the two metals , able to penetrate my outer layer . I suggest you avoid these bullets . - Follow us . - The sensors do not detect ... I hope someone will shoot you . On what data bases his claim ? My instinct . So who follow us . My sensors do not detect anything . Perhaps ... they have an anti-detection device . What form of life on this planet lost , Would be so intelligent , to own such a device ? Be ' , I do not know . Maybe those we seek ? When you shut up in this way , it means that I 'm right , right ? What will you do ? I want them to call tonight . Stay still , not ' necessary . Is ' wasting precious time for the mission . If and ' a plan to rest , It will be ' forced to raise the synthetic adrenaline dose . It ' a trap . Now shut the fuck up . My sensors do not detect anything . Wait , I 'm getting readings . - It ' very weak . - Shut up . I have a visual on the aggressor . Me too . It seems that beryllium is the matter most ' used for weapons on this planet . Do you mind continuing more ' later ? It blocks the view . We need to identify the being . Why ' , so ' you can tell the command who killed me ? - Who are you ? - I do not mean to hurt you . Who are you ? My name Jun 'hee , this is my home . Here nobody ever comes . I had to know if you were human . What could I be ? Aquarian , or worse . What 's ' worse of fish heads ? The universe and ' infinite . There are still things we do not know . Terra 219 and ' in the neutral zone . E ' prohibited Pavoriani . E ' it is forbidden even to humans . And yet , here we are . I 'm looking for someone . She is not ' allowed to talk about the mission details . This is apparently not the only one to know you 're here . - The natives are restless . - I thought you said you 're alone . No , I said that here nobody comes . We are not alone for sure . It ' s not safe to be here at night . I have a shelter nearby . This e ' against the protocol . There is no ' reason to be distracted from the mission . Sa something that does not tell us . I want to find out what ' . 'Cause you think ... Here we are safe ? Be ' , here there ' intelligent life that exceeds the Class 5 When they finished , terraforming , These settlements did not need more ' ... And have left them . The atmosphere and ' hydrogen . But , you do not have any support for respiration . I can breathe freely . There ' enough oxygen for humans . Could stordime for a couple of days , but ... I 'd rather be dizzy , which closed like a sardine . This is called For-a-fist . I need to get out of this thing . There is no ' reason for groped a posting . A hot meal and ' very good reason for me . It hungry again ? No ! I mean ... not to . I want to eat real food . And I confirm that the atmosphere and ' breathable . And I want to ... get out . You order you to detach yourself . Only one security code of the command to detach . - You must complete the mission , Jordan . - Turn to me as Captain . Do not you know that you could not lift that thing when you put it . I had no idea . Tomorrow , on those peaks , I will call ' the command to get the damn code . - There will have ' the code until ' ... - It ' , I know , until Not intercettero ' intelligence services . Thank you very much . Are you a spy hunter . Be ' , really have here more ' for ... You 've cut out ? It ' s not allowed to talk about the mission details . I 'm not going to do it . I think she 's involved . It is losing precious time . The order and ' reaching the coordinates . - Li will receive ' further instructions . - As ordered by the Command , I am the commander in charge of the mission So , if I tell you , open the microphone You open the fucking microphone ! I 'm sorry . Do not worry . That thing ' always so ' , despotic ? Always . I 'm going to get some sleep ' . Good night . Good night . You can take a picture ? Can I record anything seen in the perimeter of the viewer ... Captain . So , do it . Well , ok . Resume . You can ... Expand ? Demo Zoom . Di piu ' . E ' blurry , you can fight it for me ? Cosi ' . Wow . - Here 's what I ... - What are you doing ? I enjoy the view . Be ' , we will stay here until the morning , so if you do not mind , I sleep a bit ' . Not succeed ' to sleep . The synthetic adrenaline , will remain ' in his system For approximately 40 more hours . Watch and learn , tin head . The power of the will ' , and ' a great tract of the human race . Oh , you ' . Cosi ' is fine . - That container and ' Alliance . - Yes I see it . Oh , crap . Put it down ' . What does that mean ? - You 're a traitor to the Alliance . - I 've always been loyal to the cause . And , anyway , I 'm out of 30 cycles . Am I not your target . I would have believed if I had not found your pod date . The battery of these so harsh from 3 to 5 years , at most . So either minds about your stay here , - Or you have stocked . - I do not give you an explanation . No , I will give the command . 'Cause they gonna take you ' . Without the data-pod , You can not evade the sensors . I have not used codes to evade your computer . I 'm hunter by nature . And the real difference between a hunter and prey , And ' capacity ' to slip . - I restore oxygen levels . - You ' , do not bother me . The sonsori , what they receive ? The sensors do not receive anything . Let 's go over those hills . We establish contact with the control . We report what we found . They may have some answers . Lord , I have the Captain Jordan . He wants to speak with you directly . - On communicator . - The contact and ' weak , we 're losing From what we could get , all systems are functioning normally . Well ... Passatemelo . Hello . Command , do you read me ? Captain , for a moment , I thought I 'd lost you . I can not take so easily . I think I found what you need . Night Crowler , you 're losing , repeat . I can confirm the presence of the General Jun 'hee . I made contact . I block its signal at coordinates 2705 . I head them ' . Negative , Night Crowler , negative . I repeat ... you have to go to the coordinates 15 35 . Command , I 'm losing control , control ... - Did you hear ? - Calculate the distance right now . Command , I request the removal code for survival suit . I request the removal code . - Command ? - We 've lost contact with the control . Damn . : I will find ' my state active beneficial for her . The position of the new target , and ' to 57 km from here . It has to keep moving . E ' certain that it was the General Jun 'hee ? We still have difficulty ' to establish a secure connection with the suit . So , I can not confirm , the meeting of the Captain Strider . Jun 'hee and ' off the grid for years . The last known report , says it ' dead in the field Smuglie Outside Moron . Lieutenant Commander , he signs On how long , Strider and ' been in contact with the pavoriana ? I can not confirm NEAC that there ' was a meeting . The few data we have received , do not indicate forms of class life 4 . - So the captain of the relationship ? - The Captain might get confused . I ... Lieutenant Commander ... The project may not be undermined . Especially , if by the hands of Jun 'hee I agree , abandoned the mission . Sending a team . Jun 'hee may have already ' put your data at risk . It ' , gentlemen . Lieutenant Commander ... Personally checks that everything is in order . - And the catch . - Can go . Beautiful . His hydration level and ' stable . ' ... but I want to drink the same . - What is its temperature ? - 32 degrees Fahrenheit . Perfect . The ideal temperature for recruitment , for humans and ' 72 degrees . Obviously , you 've never had a beer . So , how long it is expected to ... - Survive in this thing ? - Has yet to be documented . It ' conceivable , that a soldier can live their whole lives In the protected environment of the suit . Do not you think my architecture , is the support ? You are not a survival suit , you 're a walking morgue . You said that the Alliance think that the planet is uninhabited . So why ' bullshit ? 'Cause slip in here . Without telling me that I need a code to get out ? Why ' I did not give me the code ? Why ' ? There ' a plateau at 1.4 kilometers to the northeast . Ricalcolero ' its estimated time of arrival . So , your idea and ' get around this cliff ? - It ' s what I figured . - Yes ' . His speed ' and ' inadequate . If you can not ' continue its original course , The next path more 'appropriate , and ' downward . I do not ... Cadro ! Stay still while I provide Repair multiple areas of cellular damage . Major overhaul . Now , can ' go to the assigned coordinates . Do not breath . She 's experiencing a temporary interruption of the respiratory cycle . - A dose of adrenaline will solve ' . - No ! Bullshit . It would be over , if I had left to do Jun 'hee . The opportunity ' and ' presented . Although she has never shown any control over the female gender . My private life is not 'of any archive , bitch . On the contrary . - Where did you get it ? - I have access to all his files . They have been updated before you leave . So , they knew it . 'Cause no one told me ? It was not aware of the most ' recent data ? None of your business ! Captain , everything about her , and ' none of my business . They are programmed to know everything about her . You know nothing . You 're a machine ! You do not know what it means to lose someone . It refers to Shelly . The archive shows that she has not tried to contact her , Before the attack of Aquarians . Let 's not talk about this . That 's enough ' ! If by ' emotional relief , I have some recordings of Shelly among my files . I love you . I love you . Stop . - Let 's walk . - You ' , come with me ? Turn off the camera . I miss you . I love you . Stop ! Do you miss me ' ? Do not go . Turn off this fucking thing ! Free me the fucking head ! Not succeed ' out of the suit using this method . Night Crowler to Command . Here Night Crowler in command , Com ... How will ' to make contact ? I told you no more ' information . - So , can I ask a question ? - You just did . Why ' and ' I hurt myself ? You have upset . I needed to hear ... something . Whatever . To remind me that I 'm still alive . - I can assure you ... - I said , now , I shut up . Damn ... And that ' happened to this thing . It was a rhetorical question . Leave free viewer . Killed by little . What have we here ? - We have other beryllium weapons . - You could have warned me before . It gave me orders to stop giving her information of this type . As if it ever stopped you . We had to leave the area and proceed with the mission . - I thought you wanted me killed . - It could be a peaceful species . I do not want to prove your theory . If you are passionate about translating and fun , come with us translate . You not want to tell me anything else ? Not at this time . I do not think it 's wise to finish the project . The Captain Strider has potential to continue . We can not risk exposing ourselves . Any unauthorized contact Seriously it is affecting this ' why we worked so hard . - Especially if there ' half Jun 'hee . - We preove Jun 'hee that is alive . If she were alive , it would be hidden for the last 20 cycles . The Neutral Zone is not ' analyzable . I would not be surprised if it was ' accident them . I do not either , and ' a good hideaway for those It has no regard for the military protocols . However , I am concerned that it appeared On a planet where there were no level life forms 5 . Jun 'hee and ' always been a great warrior . Do not you find it , if it is not to be found . Exactly , and Strider Captain , immediately had contact with her . Are you saying that is on land 219 on purpose ? I suggest that Jun 'hee and 'Land of 219 with a purpose . His motives , are not unknown . I have permission to speak now ? You ' . There ' a Covenant Transport in landing to 1 km . It reached the dell 'obietivo coordinates . It ' s very nice to know . It ' nice to see you , soldiers . Let 's go , someone remove this from me so ' I will be able ' to take a shower . Calm soldiers . I would like to see smiling faces . Come with us , Captain Strider It was enough to ask . Thaine . Captain Jordan Strider , and 'under arrest for suspected Impairment of military secrets . Impairment ? What are you talking ? She had contact with a known war criminal , Captain . The Alliance has reasonable certainty , which caused damage to the cause . I 'm on a mission that I have commanded you . Take him inside . I 'm not going anywhere , unless you tell me what 's going on . Let . Let me ! - Lieutenant Commander , what ' s the situation ? - The Commander Strider and ' safe . Although she resists . You are authorized to use all means to recover the equipment . Roger that , sir . What are you doing ? What are you doing ... what ' that . What is that ? A deactivation key . Disable the closure of the suit , - And it destroys the experiment data . - Experiment , that experiment ? No , the data can still be useful to the cause . Activate the termination code and reported the suit intact . General ? E ' an order , Lieutenant Commander . You ' , Lady . - What are you doing ? - Puts the termination sequence . Jordan ! No more lies , what the fuck is going on ? Commander , you read me ? I require confirmation of the Captain 's termination . The canceled termination , General . I performed commands . Your orders . We have to get out of here . Now . - Destroy ' data . - We can not lose another . Schierero ' second battalion at the old colony . Li intercept to the new coordinates . I agree . There ' s too much at stake , To allow the personal vendetta of Jun-hee inerferire . Order the team to kill . We must put an end to this story . They tried to kill me . They feared that the experiment had been discovered . What a fucking experiment ? General I do not ever talk . Wait ... How the hell do you know ? If you are afraid to give me information I am completely in the dark . We just killed an allied team Without speaking of my superior . That was also my friend mogliore , before they ordered my execution . I want to know why ' . Your mission was a farce . There are no war criminals . They sent you here to die . Bullshit ! I 'm a good soldier . E ' for what they have chosen you . The suit leading , And ' a mobile laboratory that records data of whatever you do . The experiment ' designed to uncover the mystery What hurts a man . How long can ' survive . What can ' bear . And as your skills ' innate , can be replicated in genetically For future soldiers . You lie . I 'm here to do a job . Tell her , tell her that you 're studying me . Tell him ! Can not ' answer . E ' was scheduled to avoid any reference to the test . The less you know , the more 'the experiment works . You are well informed , to be one which is ' out of play . I helped the development team of the suit , to find the answers I was looking for . Without having to sacrifice a soldier . Initial tests have not provided sufficient data . So ' , they ousted me . I struggled , but they have condemned me for insubordination . The board took it as a personal failure . In revenge , they chose my partner , Jen-dao , as a guinea pig for the experiment . I felt guilty for his death . I ... I also lost someone . I loved her ... More ' than anything else in the world . But I left to join the Alliance . And , now , and ' dead . E ' died knowing that you were trying to protect her . Can we do anything yet . I heard there ' a peace conference on Saintana If we had a boat , we may be ' them in three days . I left my vessel , in the north . E " them for a while ' time , but ... Should still go . If the thing and 'dirty as you say , Politicians listen to us regardless of the military . We have to find some proof . Are you the proof we need . You can make a difference . Command , here Strike 8762 . I have visual confirmation on Strike 2159 The vessel and ' was destroyed . I repeat : the vessel and ' was destroyed . There are no survivors . Passage . Take over the command of the operation . Let no one leave the system , until the capture of the fugitives . You ' , Lady . Strike , you have vision of the suit ? Negative , command . Send coodinate step . From here , we can not trace the device . I 'm sending an authorization code to activate your receiver . Back When you have a contact . They walk , can not be far . I close . They have traced for sure . There would be on him by kilometers . Let 's stop for a moment . I can not detect the vessel . But I intercepted the military transmissions , Regarding the deployment of the troops . They are in more ' than 50 km away , to the north , northwest and south . - The plan ' to catch us at the center . - You 've sent our position ? No . Maybe , your program tells you to betray us . My program requires to ensure his safety ' In every situation . Including hostile military forces , although his own Alliance . It 's a direct order ? Only the command code , can ' disattivarmi . I do not want to be disabled in other ways . I would not at all , if it counts for something . Neither . We Do not have much time , if we want to get to the northern front . Definitely you not have enough arrows to pick off three squadrons . I have a question for you . 'Cause you did not say everything at the shelter ? We could leave the planet without all these problems . Knew you would not believe me . They would pick us up . E ' was a risk , but ... I thought that their betrayal , he showed you the truth ' . Otherwise , you would not have believed me . How many chances ' I got there on your own planet ? Humans call it fate . How do you call it ? Redemption . Before we go from here , the better ' . Let 's get moving . Amplify the signal . Tell the Command That interference on the surface , blocking the beacon . The second squadron , and 'moved 3 km to the west . Direction and speed 'current , carry us beyond Their trajectory interception in 57 minutes . I understand your choice . The planet is ' beautiful . I would love to come back and enjoy it when you do not stay ' inside a jar . This planet offers much to enjoy . It ' s amazing how you do not understand certain things , until ' ... Did not and ' private . For this experiment and ' doomed to fail . No one can ' be separated from life and be kept only . It Looks like we found a passage . Of course it will 'save much time . Let 's see if they have left the keys . The vessel has unknown origin . But I note that many components They are of terrestrial origin . It is busy . You ... Thought to escape . Do not you succeeded . Let the balls . Let the balls ! I 'll you were there , however , ' no ... go dento you too . I got you . Do you want a little ' Xaou ? These things they know shit , but ... I see you over there ' . I see you . Let 's go ... I see you . I think I have vision problems . You are alone ? I thought I told you to leave . You have asked to join you . I did ? - Leave her . - I ... dett fatt ... aaah ... What are you doing here ? Friend cook the dinner . I can not eat these gruesome things . What are you doing in the Neutral Zone ? What the fuck ' the neutral zone ? I 'm here to work . I have children to feed . Are you alone ? No ! You ' , you ' , you ' . Do not shoot me friend , I do not have children to feed . I 'm late for 20 cycles . So , what ' that stuff ? E ' my little girl . It ' a beauty . I built it myself . Deep Space without deep pockets . What port ? - From the good old America . - From the Earth ? - You 're a little ' away . - Far Away ' , shit . Away , shit ! I can not take off . And ' fall a couple of days ago . And I 'm ready to go . Can I take a look ? Sure , just stay away from my cargo bay . There ' nothing ' them . No problem . Have you ever had one of these ? No . Cosine delicious . They are good to eat , Probably eaten first , puke , but ... Later , you 'll want another . The want for dinner ? Of course , it would be nice . It ' an honor ... We are facing a marvelous creature like you . I 'm not talking about you , Marine . That guy has a few screws loose . Even this ship . Sensors indicate that this velicolo not 'operational for more ' than a cycle . That explains a lot . Remember , under the ... Have you ever danced ? I bet you know dance . I have a harmonica . You could dance with that . Damage ? I can not figure , having no precise data about the project . Fuel cells are full enough . Be ' , and ' a beginning . Do not worry , you have not lost anything . These things are really horrible . - How much and ' serious ? - Maybe you can ' bring out of here . We take him with us . Can not ' do it without a ship . The cabin is just enough for one . I travel in the hold . Stay away from my hold . You have not Senito ? I told you before . Do you want to see what ' s inside ? These children will make me rich . There ' s nothing like it on Earth . Li plant in the ground . And grow trees . Can you believe it ? - Jordan ... the beacon . - Thing ? A transmitter inserted into the suit . E ' was activated . The signal and ' active for 47 seconds . - You can turn it off ? - No . E ' was activated by the control .

Please ... pull over . Okay , done , go . I 'm afraid I have some very bad news for you . Your employee , Brenda Dillon , was found dead last night . Could you come by to the precinct this morning ? Sure . Miss Warner ? - I 'm sorry to have kept you . - It 's okay . Do you want another cup of coffee or something ? I want to know what happened . I see , well ... Let me start by asking you what you know , and then ... and then I 'll tell you what I know . Well , that 'll be quick . I don 't know anything . When did you last see Brenda Dillon ? Last night . Um , I left the office about 8 : 00 . Um , she was working on some business and she told me she 'd probably stay on . Did she call you during the evening or the night ? No . Have you noticed anything strange about her recently ? Like ? Was she nervous or depressed about something ... Not that I know of , no . No . When did you start your company ? Two years ago . And when did you hire Miss Dillon ? When I first started the company . Well , we knew each other already . We were friends . I see . - How did you meet each other ? - Look , excuse me , my friend just died . I mean , why are you asking me these questions ? We have evidence that Brenda Dillon was murdered . What ? How ? We found traces of the chase , as if she 'd been running away from something . From what ? What do you mean ? We found broken locks , slammed doors ... Apparently , she tried to escape through the rooftops . Well , did ... was she pushed or something ? I mean ... No , we have no evidence for that ... yet . Um ... I 'm sorry , I don 't ... um ... um ... Wait a minute , am I a suspect here ? We don 't have any reason to suspect you . Yeah , it 's a shame . She looked quite sexy . I bet it 's not the last time we hear about that Brenda Dillon murder . You seen the CCTV in our office building ? I mean , where you see her run through the lobby twice in a row ? Yeah , creepy . Forensic guy showed me the thing they found in her body ... some kind of metallic artifact . In her chest , right ? I 'm not buying that . I saw it with my own eyes . It looked like a metallic claw or something , implanted just under her left rib . Oh , yeah ? And who put that in her , huh ? The little green men ? Listen , if you don 't believe me , just go and see the body yourself . Is she really that hot ? - Before her autopsy , she was . - Excuse me , sorry . Hey , this is Mike . Leave a message . Mike , it 's me . Um , listen , something ... something really bad has happened . I need you to call me back . Listen , I 'm really confused , and I need you to call me back , okay ?

Oh God , please . Ahh ! Oh . God . Shit . Hey , this is Mike . Leave a message . Mike , it 's me . I have to come over . Uh ... I think we 're in danger . Two more strange deaths today following the mysterious murder of Brenda Dillon two days ago . Carol Bannington , age 32 , and Frederick Greenberg , age 29 , were found dead this morning in similar circumstances . While an anonymous source at the police department contends that an unidentified metallic artifact was found in all three bodies , Officer Mustapha Makkur , in charge of the cases , keeps denying that rumor . Hello ? Mike ? I used my key . Don 't remember that one . Hello ? - Kate ? - Yeah , Mike , it 's me . - What are you doing here ? - Um ... I have to talk to you . Come up . Thank you . Wait a minute . Hey . Hey . Come in . You 're at your place . What are you doing here ? Did you get my messages ? Yeah . Yeah . So , what 's new ? So you didn 't get my messages ? No . I 'm ... I 'm so sorry about what happened between us . It 's fine . You look tired . I , uh ... I work too hard . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm just ... I 'm just thirsty . Could you get me a coffee , please ? Sure . You lost your job , Mike . You don 't work too hard ! Hey . Hey , open the door . I know you 're upset about what happened between us . And I 'm real sorry about everything . But let 's talk about it , Kate . You know how much I love you . I 'm trying to find a job , but it 's hard . And that 's why I 'm so ... tired . Come on , baby . You never call me " baby . " Open the fuckin ' door ! Kate , if you don 't open that fucking door , I 'm gonna rip your fuckin ' neck off , 'cause I know where you live . And I 'm gonna come there . And I swear ... open the goddamn door ! Kate , what the hell are you doing here ? Just let me take a shower and then ... - No , Mike , no ... - Come on in . - Look , I really need to ... - No no no no , Mike . No , you have to listen to me . Why did I leave you ? - fuck do I know ? - Mike , it 's important . Please . - Fuck . You left me ' cause you 're a crazy , selfish work-a-holic girl . - It is you , it is you . - Hey hey hey hey . Thank God , it 's you , it 's you , it 's you . - Come on , we have to go . - Whoa whoa whoa . I 'm not going anywhere with you . Mike , listen to me . Carol , Brenda and Frederick have been killed . Is this some kind of joke ... or trick you 're pulling to try and get back with me ? We have to leave . - And what the fuck is ... ? - Trust me . You have to believe me . This is really happening . Are you still on your medication ? No . No , I stopped everything ... the sleeping pills , everything . Listen , Mike . Even the police officer looked like he knew something he didn 't want to tell . Or maybe he wasn 't authorized to do so . Oh , come on . Look , spare me your conspiracy theory . This is bullshit . You 're not like that . They found an object inside Brenda 's body . - Oh , bullshit . - And there 's another thing that all of the victims have in common . Schizophrenia ? Look . Yeah , so what ? I got this on at my apartment . I have it , you have it , Brenda has it , and all of the others too . Yeah , it 's our group . Right , it 's our group . Now , do you remember when this picture was taken ? Do you remember when our group met , or where ? Well ... well , it 's an old story , so ... I know , but think . Okay , well ... Okay , I don 't remember . I don 't either . And these were our best friends . Well , there 's got to be some kind of rational explanation . I 'm the one who always said that . Yeah , I know . It was always pissing me off when we were together . Oh my ... oh my God . That sound . That 's when they come . What ? Oh my God , let 's go . Let 's go . Fuck . Okay , now do you believe me ? That was me . That was ... Come on , come on . We gotta go ... they can come back . Okay . I 'm calling Officer Makkur . - Hello ? - Hello there . Ah ! Oh , fuck . Fuck . Oh fuck , they 're tracking our fucking cells . - Drop your cell . - What are you talking about ? - Drop it . - You 're kidding , right ? No , it 's easy if you have the right accesses . Well , why don 't we just turn them off then ? Because they can track you even when the phone is off . - Drop it ! - Okay . What ... so now what ? Now we go to Stu 's . What ... are you crazy ? On foot ? What , like , you want to take my car ? Fuck ? What the ... ? What the hell ? Who 's playing with the fucking ... Stu ? Stu ? Stu ? You there ? Oh God . Oh my God , oh God . Mike , there . Oh . Oh , God . This artifact ... where was it found in the others ? Under the left rib . Mike , no . What are you doing ? You can 't do that . - Oh , yeah ? Why not ? - It 's Stu ! Oh , yeah ? We don 't even remember how we met him . Shh , please don 't yell . Look , I 'm sorry . But we have to get to the bottom of this , okay ? Just don 't look , okay ? Jesus . What the hell is this ? If he 's got one ... What ? I can 't feel anything . You think we 've got one inside us ? Yeah , check to see if I got a scar or something . Yeah yeah . No no . No no , there 's nothing . Me ? Me ? - No , there 's nothing . - Okay . - We have to go . Come on . - Okay , let 's go . Come on , come on . Mike , do you hear that ? Yeah , it 's the same noise we heard in the car . We shouldn 't keep it . They 're using the artifacts to track us down . That 's how they find us . Mike ! Oh , fuck ! My hand ! Jesus . Oh , come on . - Where has he gone ? - Come on , let 's go . - We need to find somewhere safe . - Where 's he gone ? He 's just gone . I 'm losing it , Mike . Yeah , I 'm here . That is my problem . What ? I don 't remember how we met , Mike . Well , I remember how we broke up . I left you . I know that . I left you ' cause you were about to leave me . No , you were crazy and you were popping pills at the speed of light . I know that . I mean , do you remember how we broke up ? Physically , I mean . Physically ? Yeah . I mean , what I said , what you said . In detail . Well , we were in a car . And ... and ... I don 't remember . I know . All these memories are like ... I can 't feel them . I don 't trust my own memory anymore . I don 't trust myself . Hey . Do you trust me ? I don 't know . Wake up , wake up . One ... one of us has to stay awake . Mm ... All right , I 'll take the first shift . - No , I 'll take it . - No , come on . Don 't ... don 't do that again , please . I 'm not tired , Mike . You look tired . You do too . Get some sleep . Oh , God , don 't do that . Oh , God . There 's traces of this all over the web . I never saw anything like it . We 'll figure it out tomorrow . Get some rest . I 'm not gonna go to sleep . - Don 't you trust me ? - No , that 's not it . I was just thinking ... What ? I love you . I love you too . Hey . What 's going on ? Nothing . Hey . Ah , sorry , I fell asleep . - Mmm . - Mmm . Hey , wait a sec . What the hell is that ? Jesus Christ . Oh my God . " You find a doctor . " Signed " CF . " Who 's CF ? Carl Francken . What , you know this guy ? Dr. Bender to the message board , please . Dr. Bender ? My God . My God , what is this ? No scars . How did you get them ? We don 't know , that 's the point . But we need them out . You 'll have to tell me a little bit more than that - if you want me to open you up . - You don 't understand . We don 't have time . You have to help us . Now . No , I can 't . I could lose my license . Even under the threat of a gun . You fuckin ' moron ! - Mike ! - Don 't you understand ... that we need your help here ? All our friends are dead , and we 're next . Please . Go ! I can 't do a general alone . So you 'll have to settle for a local . In a few moments , you 'll start to feel dizzy . During the operation , please don 't look at the wound . I 'll go see . Just look back . I 'm asking you one last time . Please don 't make me do this . Mike , no ! Ah ! Who the hell are you ? I 'm Carl Francken . I 'm your eye . My what ? I 'm the one who 's supposed to be looking after you . After me ? After all of you . Do you mean ... do you mean the people in the picture ? You were many more than that . How did I meet these people ? You didn 't meet them . You were matched . Matched ? What about me and Mike ? Were we matched too ? The truth is , you never actually met before yesterday . What do you mean , we never " actually " met ? It 's an experiment of some sort . Like chess . So I 'm like a ... a chess piece ? There 's a black Kate and a white Kate ? Who 's playing this game ? People . Like them ? Well , that would be exciting , wouldn 't it ? So you 're ... you 're one of them ? Oh , in a way . I 'm here to help . I 'm confused . They don 't understand us , Kate . They don 't understand what makes us who we are . So they test us . They try every possible situation ... every experiment they can think of ... to watch our reaction , analyze it . How do you react when you 're facing yourself ? How do you distinguish from a copy of yourself ? Who will win ? The original or the perfect copy ? It all comes down to the same questions they 've been trying to answer for years ... what makes us human ? What makes us unique ? Remove the artifact . What ? I can 't ... what ... I 'll die if I open myself up like that . You won 't . You do it . I can 't . You said you wanted to help me . That I can 't do . No , please don 't go . Don 't go , please . We 'll meet again soon . I promise . I can . Ahh ! Ahh ! Ah ! Ah ! Who am I , Carl ? You 're one of the most deeply human people I found . What ... how do you know ... I observed you for months . I selected you for this experiment . You don 't know anything about me . You 're 28 years old . You 're a young , amazing girl who doesn 't know who she is . You 're trapped in psychological problems that you created on your own . You have such a low opinion of yourself , but you have everything you need to be happy . You 're beautiful . And you 're one of the most intelligent people I know . You 're funny . You have a profound need to help people . But you 're very lonely . And you deserve not to be . You 're perfect . You just don 't know it . We 'll meet again soon , I promise . I promise .

And as I keep telling you repeatedly , All things have a magnetic context , Especially things in that warehouse . Pete , you cannot go into that place with so much negative energy . You want to fight with her ? Fine . Fight with her , but not there . One of us has to be in charge out in the field . Don 't you think ? You haven 't listened to a word I 've said , have you ? Yeah , yeah . I 'm just saying somebody leads , somebody follows , right ? I mean , I have more experience , more know-How . I 'm more grounded . Pete , you 're the obvious choice here . - Well , I- - - Listen Do me a favor , will you ? You let Myka think that she 's running things , Because really , she 's very , very , very sensitive . Sometimes I just want to punch him . He reminds me of my father , you know ? He 's arrogant . I think he 's kind of sexy . So not my type . Really ? What 's your type ? I don 't know , Leena . Opposable thumbs maybe ? Hello , ladies . We 're not interrupting girl talk are we ? Like now , see ? I could punch him right now . All right , game time . Come on . Come on . Come on . A nun , a teenager , and an old lady All acting strangely in Unionville , Colorado . I have research here that indicates That each of these people knew exactly what they were doing . The thing is they couldn 't stop themselves from doing it for some reason . Well , could there be a practical explanation ? Something in the water ? Nothing . I checked . Maybe it 's just a bad flu bug . Well , only three cases in a town of thousands indicates it was something non-Viral . Although I still need to rule out anything bacterial , Parasitic , priotic , virotic , and of course fungal . I was kidding . No , no , never rule out anything until you 've ruled it out . Oh , and I want you guys to ask each of the victims My list of field recovery questions . - Artie , not the questions , please ? - God , they 're embarrassing . Yeah , my only pleasure left in life . Concocting ways to embarrass you . Here , in case you lost them . Take this . You know , how can it matter If a person smells fudge before an incident ? Yeah , or if your gall bladder is feeling numb ? Humor me . All right , I want you to go to Unionville . Find out if these three people are connected in some way . And if they are , is there an artifact At the center of it ? If there is , bring it home . Simple . Easy peasy . Oh , a transpo . My truck 's still in lake Michigan . God , that was cold . Word . all right . Take my car . Just--Ah ! No food , no drink . Don 't go over 55 . Don 't park near anything . What ? After a certain age , a person likes to have a nice car . Artie , one of us needs to be in charge . - Somebody has to run point . - You . Good , then we 're both on the same page . Well , of course , Myka . I mean , you 're the obvious choice . Just do me a favor , please . Let Pete think that he 's running things . He 's very , very touchy . I can make that work . Good . So any news on the breach at the warehouse ? There 's been no breach . Just a two-Bit hacker who 's going nowhere . Well , after the dead end at Dickinson 's , It looks like you 're the one that 's getting nowhere . I , my dear , am choosing to ignore this irritating pest . I suggest you do the same . There could be a probable explanation . High-Tension power lines . A nearby chemical spill . People just don 't go crazy . Uh-Huh ? Why don 't you go to the local county records office , See if you can pull the geographics- - - How about we just talk to folks And get a vibe for the town first ? We need a plan , Pete . Something with a little more logic and a little less kumbaya . Or we could just , you know , improvise . 50 cents ! Can you believe that ? See what happens ? Okay , now we have a plan . No , now we improvise . Some people , man , I mean , always blaming the other guy . This patient weighed 300 pounds , you know ? He smoked like a chimney . All he ate was butter . He was dead before he got to us , you know ? It 's my fault he had a heart attack ? He was dead before he got to us . Excuse me . My husband , he died of- - Oh , the hell with them . What do they know ? - Would you mind , please ? - Lady , I 'm on a break , okay ? Do you mind ? Who 's that talking right there ? I don 't know . Some old lady looking for free medical advice probably . - No , meg ... - Mm-Hmm ? I don 't think that it 's your high blood pressure Medicine that 's causing this . I 'm so embarrassed . My daughter will be furious . You know , it could be a receptor Or channel blockers can cause dizziness Or it could be a sugar imbalance . I noticed your diabetic pendant . You a doctor ? No , I just know a lot . Well , her insulin levels are good . It 's not her meds . Besides , meg 's not the only one to go off the deep end lately . Really ? That 's one crazy old lady in there , huh ? Oh , no . Meg 's an eighth-Grade English teacher . She 's as sane as I am . Wait a minute . She spends all day with 13 year olds And one blue tool sends her over the edge ? I guess everybody has their limit . Any similarities between her , the flying nun , and that violinist kid ? What did you say you were doing in Unionville ? Oh , my wife and I are just passing through . You know , we 're on our honeymoon , so . Anybody mention smelling fudge or- - What exactly do you do for a living , mister- - Pete . I 'm Pete . - And you 're- - - Hey , Mac . Uh , Mac . Everybody around here just calls me Mac . We got another situation . What 's up , Sal ? Tommy Wilson was caught trying to set the music room on fire . Principal wants you to come down . On my way , Sal . Have a nice honeymoon . Honeymoon ? Why would you say that ? I wanted a cover . I don 't want to say who we are just yet . You know , we stay on the down low , We operate more freely . Okay , you just can 't run around town saying whatever comes into your head . We have to stay under the radar . Remember stealth ? Covers are , like , the definition of stealth . Plus , I 'm very good at them . You 're ten years old . You are ten years old . You know , I 'm gonna go interview the nun . Fine . Sounds like the violinist kid is getting worse , So I 'm gonna go check that out . That 's all right with you , sarge ? - You 're eight years old . - Eh . I knew I could fly . I just knew it . Where were you before you , um ... Jumped ? I had just left the center . Sister grace works most days at a battered women 's shelter . Have you received any jewelry of any kind recently ? Any gifts ? Anything new ? We are nuns . We renounce worldly possessions . Of course . Right . Did you know Tommy Wilson or meg ... riley ? Not really . Is Tommy all right ? Yes , I just thought maybe- - I can fly . I can . Uh , can I talk to you outside for a second ? Will you excuse us ? Hey , Mac , sorry to bother you , But can I ask you a few questions about the Wilson kid ? Strange way to spend your honeymoon there , Pete . Lattimer . Agent Pete Lattimer . Secret service . Secret service ? Hope you 're not flashing that badge all over town and scaring folks . No one 's trying to scare anybody . I 've got enough problems around here lately Without people thinking this is some kind of terrorist plot . there 's no plot . Look , Mac , you just let me do my job . - No one will be hurt . I 'll be on- - - No , sir , not if your job is sneaking around lying to folks . I don 't trust people who lie to me . I just need to ask Tommy a few questions . Tommy Wilson slipped into a coma about an hour ago . Now can the secret service explain that ? Because the doctors sure as hell can 't . I noticed that sister grace was wearing one of those rubber bracelets for domestic violence awareness . Yes , she came to us about a year ago . I can 't go into details , but there was a fair amount of abuse . I 'm sorry . Has she been depressed lately ? I mean , I 'm assuming this incident is new behavior . Well , she hasn 't jumped off any other buildings , If that 's what you mean . Of course not . It 's just- - I 'd really like her to get some rest If that 's all right with you . Right . Sure . Thank you , father . Sister Grace ? Oh , my God ! Sister Grace ! The wind . Sister ! Stay there , sister . I 'm coming up . Sister ! I can fly . You cannot fly ! Grace Ellen ! So wait , the snow bank saved her life ? - Yeah , I mean , sister grace is alive , But she 's all busted up from the fall . Should put the snow bank in a warehouse . Okay , it sounds like it 's intensifying . Is Tommy still in a coma ? Yeah , yeah . I was just over there . The doctor said he just kind of shutdown . Okay , well that sounds like it 's causing some kind of regression . You got to find this thing fast before it gets worse . You got that ? Uh ... yeah . Have you ever seen anything like this ? Well , actually , once there was this Little bell and what it did was it made people laugh . Oh , well that doesn 't sound very dangerous . Oh , yeah ? Well , the victims would ultimately Laugh themselves to death . Cardiac arrest due to asphyxiation . Freaky . So what you 're saying is there 's always a link ? Always . And you just keep looking under rocks And I 'll do what I can from here , okay ? Book on tape . It 's always mind control . Hey ! I have work to do . Okay . Okay . That 's that . Now cut that out . Thanks . You didn 't get that from me . I 'm running a business here . - hey . - hey . So nothing connects . Tommy never had meg As a teacher . Meg doesn 't know sister grace . And sister grace Taught Sunday school , But Tommy never took it . So they 're all doing things Completely out of character ? So if someone does something totally opposite From what they normally do- - Drugs . Although the old lady and the nun Don 't strike me as crackheads . Not so much . Hey . I thought the medic Might know something , So I asked him To meet me after work . Good idea . I got a thing to do . But , Myka , I want you to be careful . I want you to use A condom . That 's hilarious . - thanks for taking the time . - oh , no worries . Wife 's taking care Of the twins , so . - oh , um , congratulations . - six months . They say it gets easier . Do you want to sit down ? Uh , yeah , sure . Sorry I 'm late , by the way . It 's just such a weird day . Did something else happen ? Do you remember meg From the coffee shop ? Let me guess . She went a little crazier , right ? Yeah . Middle of a planning meeting For a children 's carnival , She threw a lamp At father braid . - was he hurt ? - he 's all right . I was just at his office . A couple of stitches And she broke her wrist . But the weird thing Is they 're really good friends . Father braid helped her through The loss of her husband last year . Did he die at the hospital Where meg threw the urn ? It was in the emergency room . He had a heart attack . Okay , so ... Hey . Hey , I 'm up here . I 'm Dave . Haven 't seen you Around before . You new ? Eight years actually . I 'm just passing through town . I 'm Pete . Welcome , Pete . It 's a great meeting . Good . I could use one tonight . All right , meeting time . Take a seat if you can , please . Welcome to the Saturday night Solutions meeting . My name is Ellis . I 'm an alcoholic . Ellis . And I 'll be your leader For tonight . Can you think of anything These people have in common ? I can 't . Meg isn 't even From Unionville . She 's from Colton . That could be important . How far is , um- - Can I just touch these ? - hey ! - Ross ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! I don 't even know Why I 'd do that ! I 've never done anything Like that before . I 'm married . I told you , right ? I have twins . I told you that . Wait a second . Just wait a second . Can I just touch this one ? Okay , I think I know What 's going on here . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . That hurts . I don 't know Why I keep doing that . I believe you . I just rather you didn 't Do it again , okay ? Ross , you lost your balance . What ? Right before you just- - You lost your balance . So did meg before she threw That guy through the glass And Tommy in the video . What are you saying ? You 've got it . Whatever this is , You 've been affected too . And if not for this program Taking it one day at a time , I 'd have been dead 22 years ago . But I was willing to do anything To keep from taking that next drink . Anything . So if you ... Dave . You 're all right ? Dave ? - thank you for this . - no problem . Okay , so we know that you 've Been in contact with meg . What about sister grace Or Tommy Wilson ? No , I don 't even know Tommy And I 've only seen the sister at church . Hey , Dave , What are you doing here ? - Pete ? - hang on Myka . Thanks , Pete . Yeah , it 's all right , man . Dave , cut it out ! Hey , hey , hey . No , no , no , no . Dave , what are you doing ? Yeah , you got over 20 years , man . What 's up ? Did something happen to you ? Why ? Who are you ? This is Pete . Pete , this is Ellis Hayes , My therapist . Oh , for crying out loud . Okay , I 'm sorry . I won 't do it again . I won 't touch Your breasts anymore . What are you doing ? We talked about this . Wait , you talked to Ross ? Wait a minute . Do you treat an old lady named meg And a teenage violinist ? I can 't discuss My patients with you . We got a lot of questions For you , pal . Dave . Dave ! Dave ! Hurry and uncuff me . We need to get him To a hospital right away . Call 911 . Okay , so what , Dave is in a coma too ? Yeah , he collapsed right In front of us . The doctors are bringing In some specialist . Well , I doubt that specialist Is gonna be any help . I mean , I think this thing ultimately Shuts down the central nervous system . I 'm worried it 's gonna go further And shutdown the body entirely . - what about that therapist ? - I 'm going to see him now . And I 'm gonna Go see father braid . See if I can get some details about When sister grace went into therapy . Maybe it 's time related . Time ? No , no , no , no , no , no . No , the pattern Of behavior here Is the result of individual contact With the same artifact . It was something they found . They might have seen it . Probably , they touched it . What am I looking for ? Anything that might cause an electrical Or chemical imbalance in the brain . Oh , well , So a brain imbalancer . That 's easy . It 's probably right next To his time-travel machine . No . Trust yourselves . You 're gonna know It when you see it . That 's why we chose you . Instinct and observation . You 're a great team . What--what is that ? Where are you ? We are at An ice skating rink . - feel better there , twinkle toes ? - I like skating And it Helps me think , Artie . I have nothing but faith . Nothing but faith . For crying out loud . Who designed this ? Thomas Edison , Nicola Tesla , And M.C. Escher . What are you doing here ? Thought you might need me . Do you ? Please . It 's no big deal . I 'm just trying to track down An electrical short or an anomaly . I tracked it down . I 'll take that as a yes . I don 't care If you 're James Bond . What a therapist discusses With his patients Is completely privileged . Well , not under The patriot act . I have no intention of- - Look , Ellis , People are being hurt . Believe me , You want to help me Or you 're not gonna Have any patients left . What 's this ? Don 't touch that , Please . I just acquired it . - really ? - don 't pick it up . It 's an antique . Belonged to Joseph Dunninger , The famous mentalist . Are you kidding me , man ? What , you didn 't think that this Was worth mentioning ? I collect pocket watches . There 's nothing in the patriot Act about that , is there ? - I have to take this with me . - you what ? Don 't snap your pencil . I 'll get it back to you ... Probably . Sheriff McKenna was just here And I told him the same thing . Sister grace has never been To see Ellis Hayes . Well , how can you Be sure ? 'Cause I suggested it And she refused . She was mortified By the idea . I happen to believe In therapy . I suggested it To meg as well . Anger issues ? When Ben died , She felt betrayed by doctors , by god . It 's quite common for- - I know how she feels . Since I lost Sam ... The men in my life drive me ... Even before my dad- - Yes , well , To get back to meg . I suppose she 's Been more angry with- - Men . Angry at men . Agent Bering ? My boss , my colleagues , My partner , my father , They 're everywhere , Suffocating . Agent Bering ? Are you all right ? Myka ? Thank you so much . I 'll--I 'll just show Myself out . Ellis just called me . He 's very upset . Now I want to know just what The hell you two are up to . I got people to protect In this town . You think you can Just walk all over me ? Dude , you 're taking this kind Of personal , don 't you think ? Secret service ? Anybody could buy a badge On the internet . I don 't know what You two got planned . But I will do Whatever I have to To protect my country . Chew on that . Oh , hey . And where have you been ? - no , I was- - - I 've been here for half an hour . Oh , and the sheriff Is a little spooky , fyi . But don 't worry , Because I found it . Joseph Dunninger 's watch . He 's a famous mentalist , In case you didn 't know . So score one for the Pete-dog . Swish ! Ah ! Don 't worry . You 're still in charge . I mean , look , we can 't all Be heroes all the time . - your chance to be a hero- - - you 're an ass . Myka , geez Louise . Ow ! Okay , little girl , Fun 's over . Myka , I think You got it . You infected it . Thanks for bailing me out , But this is ridiculous . I 've been exposed To the artifact . What am I supposed to do , Let you sit in jail And quietly slip into a coma ? I could get really dangerous , Pete , to you . You know , I 'm going back inside . Wait , wait , wait . Myka , look . No , you look . You have a job to do . How can you trust me if you know That I could turn on you at any minute ? Because I do , Okay ? I just do . You 're gonna have to do more Than take a swing at me . Besides , how you gonna Be in charge if you 're in jail , huh ? Who 's gonna tell me What to do ? Hey , Artie . Artie , I 've got it . I 've been exposed . Are you sure ? Oh , yeah . We 're sure . Okay . Well , it 's just that much More important to find this artifact fast . Hey , Artie , look . So there 's no way It could be the watch , right ? I mean , maybe the , You know- - The anti-magnetic Bag thing didn 't work . It is not the watch . Myka didn 't touch the watch . And sister grace Wasn 't even a patient . I told him It wasn 't the watch . - I told you it wasn 't the watch . - that 's not annoying at all . Look , look , guys . You 're doing great . You just have to both go out There and keep looking . Artie , I 've been exposed . I have to stay locked up . Yeah , I told her I can handle it . Please , like you Handled the bar ? Get it together . People are in hospitals . It 's only a question of time Before somebody dies From this thing that you Have not found yet . - all right . - okay . You know , he 's trying To find the location Of this warehouse by probing The electrical grid . Look at that . Not a bad notion . This guy 's a thinker . And what , We 're just sitting ducks ? No , no , no , no . Look at that . It 's completely unfocused . He 's got no actual Control of anything . He 's just causing trouble . Well , he seems to be doing A good job of that . Yeah . Okay , so maybe there 's Something going on - before it affects you . - Pete , I insist that you handcuff me . Make sure that I can 't hurt you . Look , Myka , Let 's find the artifact- - I need you To disarm the danger first . Listen to me for once ! No , you don 't ! Okay , all right . All right . Sorry about that . No , no , no , no , no , no . No worries . It 's my fault . I kind of did that On purpose . I mean , what were you Thinking just then ? - what were you feeling ? - nothing . Okay , I was kind of thinking That you were an infantile chimp . - I 'm sorry . - no , no , okay . That 's good . So obviously it affects Your subconscious . Subconscious ? Subconscious desires . Pete , that 's it . Meg wants revenge . Sister grace wants to escape . Ross--I bet that Ross 's wife is Still breast-feeding . And Tommy secretly Hates the violin . And you subconsciously want To punch me every five minutes . Okay , sometimes . But why me and not you ? And why hasn 't The whole town gone nuts ? Okay , well , Let 's just retrace our steps . Where have you gone That I haven 't ? - okay , we were at the ... - coffee shop . - and at the bar , right ? - I was at the jail , But nobody else There was affected , so I don 't- - Myka . That 's Ross . - that 's meg . - you 've been in that church . Twice . You ? No . Father , It 's in the church . What 's in the church ?

We know we 're bordering on the illegal . Any moment we could all go to jail ... Sir , you know we 've worked for the cause ... but there 's a limit . If we send this poor guy into space , we 'll be famous ... not as heroes , but as murderers ! Nobody move ... nobody How can you give us orders ? You owe us two months ' salary . You wanna get paid ?

It 's just a couple of orbits . It 's easy for you to say , because you 're not going to do it . - Think about your pupils . - They 're just a bunch of juvenile delinquents . You 're sure everything is OK ? It was nothing , just a gas leak ... It 's all fixed . There 's no reason to be so scared . - So , you 're sure that everything is OK ? - More than sure . Come on . You 're gonna act like a man and get in that spaceship ! It 's time . Everybody 's waiting for you . You 'll be Latin America 's hero , more than Neruda , more than Che Guevara , more than Maradona !

Up Up , . up beauty ... Up , .. Up ... Up ! ! Damn it ! Damn it ! Damn it ! Up ! CHILE CAN DO IT Atacama Space Oddity I did it ! ... I did it ! ATACAMASPACECENTER In the name of the father , the son and the holy spirit .. It worked , Patricio ! I can 't believe it ! This is historic ! I 'd like to see the faces of those Air Force people now ! And those government types who shut the door in my face ... ! This is historic . I did it ! What happened here ? Remember all these people saying I was a dreamer . Naive ... Where is everybody ? What happened ? What happened ? It happens that I 'm breaking the monopoly on space I 'd like to see the faces on the Americans now ! According to Intelligence it could be ... 1. - A ballistic Intercontinental Missile Test Chilean Army denies it , but Intelligence recommends us not to believe them and reminds us that we never admit anything either . 2. - A businessman swore to put a Chilean into space , but Why ? . Can they do it ? . With what technology ? Intelligence reminds us that every time it rains in Chile all the streets flood ... - And 3 ... - Al Qaeda . Some kind of satellite with Anthrax or other toxin that could completely spray the sky over the US in less than an hour Sir . Go on ... Intelligence checked with Hollywood and there are at least three scripts based on that plot ... Shit ! prepare an AZ 27 missile . Sir what are you saying ? . I remind you that according the last non proliferation treaty ... Don 't talk to me about politics , send them a missile , let 's blow them to pieces . - But Sir ... - Don 't ask me to respect a treaty , this is self defense there is a terrorist up there with no respect for human life . How beautiful ! Unconfirmed breaking news arrived to our press department indicates that the controversial businessman , Patricio Rodriguez has been successful at putting a man into space . The Chilean Air Force and the government with drew all support for the project ... in the face of danger that the possible crew might suffer . That danger seemed confirmed when six months ago a group of astronauts candidates ... presented a complaint to the courts , as these images show : He almost killed us with his training . No respect for human life . And not only that ! He owes us five months ' salary ... Rodriguez is being sought for these and other pending suits . His where abouts are unknown ... Here are the latest images of the eccentric and controversial entrepreneur ... To all who colluded with American Imperialism and closed the doors on us ... I want to tell them , we will persevere in our mission whatever the cost ! From now on , we 'll be undercover . But our results will be public . Victorious ... knowing that Space is for everyone . Guillermo Zuñiga , a humble high school teacher , with his courage will put his name above every other national hero ... Imbecile ! Look , Miss ... The problem isn 't how to get it up there ... What we wonder is how they 're gonna get it down again . Good day . Tonka , from the Ministry of Defense , with General Suarez I can 't , I don 't see the orbital scanner . The simulator for landing is broken . I have no idea how to repair it . Some asshole shot it . Why do you need so many instruments ? You said the Russians put Gagarin in orbit without computers . If I 'd known , I wouldn 't have made that poor guy get back in the ship ... Forget the instruments ! Start working on those pen and paper calculations . From now on , we ' re under manual control , and I want to know ASAP where this idiot is flying to . You realize what we 've done ? C 'mon stop ! Something can be done , can 't it ? . You 're the technical guy . Think ! ... Think ! Hello , Control Earth ? This is Guillermo Zúñiga , safe and sound in outer space . There is only one thing we can do . Ask NASA for help ! - No ! - Yes , it 's the only way out ! Call NASA ? What for ? To declare my defeat ? No way ! - Hello Earth ? - I 'd rather see him mummified than call the gringos . I can 't stand watching this poor unfortunate guy die ! Octavio ! Come here ! Hello ... Control Earth ... Hello . Octavio , Sir ... Octavio , Patricio , Sir , do you hear me ? Guillermo Zuñiga , safe and sound in outer space I see the earth , the stars . - Problem Sir . - What happened now ? Intelligence informs that since Moscow is no longer our enemy , the nuclear shield has been deactivated ... and ... Our missiles are directed to Iran , Iraq , Korea , China , Venezuela , Nicaragua , etc the list goes on Sir ... the problem is that we can 't have anything ready before 24 hours Sir . You all know your orders , in 15 minutes I want the President and the high command in a safe place . - Look for the best available men . - Yes Sir ! . We 'll send them to Chile , to take over the space center and blow up the satellite far from the US . I have them Sir ... Officer John Montgomery , letal weapon , handles explosives and expert shooler . Officer Peter Chevalsky , mathematician physicist , expert on aeronautics ... His father worked in the Star Wars Project Sir . - With George Lucas ? - No Sir , with Ronald Reagan . Ready , these guys are crazy men ... in witch wind of world are we living in ... Guantanamo , World Police Subsidiary - Murderer , criminal ... - Leave it , traitor ... Stop , please stop . I won 't call the Americans . I swear ! . I 'll call the Russians ... Look ! Ivan Kurnikov sent his CV when we started the project . This guy was Chief of Communications for the Soyuz 2 , 3 , and 4 . If anyone can get Guillermo down , it 's Ivan Kurnikov . He 's a genius ! - You think we have time to get a Russian here ? - No , he 's right here in Copiapo ! He has an electrical repair shop , - Then why didn 't we call him earlier ? . - Maybe his age ... 94 years old ! You know what it 's like to be ninety-four ? . You shit and pee all day long ! You need diapers ! We need an all-purpose scientist here ! Not a Russian baby with diapers ! Well , it 's this ... or say good bye to Guillermo ... I don 't know how long the oxygen will last . Hello . Control Earth , do you hear me ? If you can hear me , you should know I can 't hear you . If you can hear me , I 'd like to know why we haven 't started the descent . Maybe I was supposed to push a button . I don 't know ... I don 't wanna screw up . Are you listening ? Over . Hello . Earth Control ! Do you hear me ? Do you hear me ? Loud and clear , Guillermo . Finally ! What 's going on ? Why aren 't I going down ? ... I 'm waiting for instructions . Any problem ? I lost communication for a long time ... Hello ! Over ! First and foremost , relax , Guillermo We want to tell you , everybody is proud of you ! Isn 't it true , guys ? You 've become a national hero ! Congratulations ! Thanks ! I love you all too ! We have good news . Given the mission 's huge success , as you can see we 've decided to extend it a couple more orbits around ... What ? . We 're moved by your courage . We know you won 't let us down . Isn 't it true , boys ? Octavio ? Guillermo ! We 're all working for you here . But relax ! Don 't get yourself worked up ... Control your oxygen . Hero ! Hero ! Poet of the Stratosphere . Yeah , I 'm coming ... Can 't you do anything alone ? Cheers to the crew over there ! Thanks , boys ! I guess you know what you 're doing . Patricio , Sir , could you call my girlfriend and tell her everything is OK up here ? Hi , Magda ... Hi , a pastry please . - Did you watch TV ? . Did you see your boyfriend ? - I saw it , but he 's not my boyfriend . What 's he doing in space ? Wasn 't be supposed to be a poet ? . Just a Spanish teacher . But I told you ... it 's over . You 're crazy ... This guy couldn 't be more famous , and you wanna break up with him ? - But when he was a no one , you were crazy for him . - It 's my life , OK ? It 's none of your business . You 're so weird ... , Ana Maria , look Guillermo 's gonna be a famous when he comes back to Earth . Women will chase after him , and he won 't pay any attention to you ... Thanks ... Good for him . I don 't care ! You have no idea ! It 's written all over yourface ... You 're all nervous . Scared with the TV news . Hi Girls ! - Ana please , don 't worry . - I 'm fine , thanks ... - But , look at your face ? - I don 't want the boss to know anything . The old lady is lost , don 't worry . We put him in orbit , didn 't we ? That 's a lot ... I mean the Russians and Americans have faced worse problems . Space travel demands some sacrifice , right ? . How awful ... He 's playing his own funeral march ... Yeah ... just go already ! Ana Maria , I 'm fed up with doing classes and putting up with a gang of juvenile delinquents ... My throat is killing me ! I don 't like selling underwear , but I 'm not gonna go dance topless ! You can 't compare going into space with dancing topless ! It 's safer to dance topless . And they pay you ! You will risk your life for peanuts ! But when I come back , I 'll be famous . I 'll be the face of some department store ... I 'll earn millions . You believe this ? Look how they picked an astronaut : by lottery . Through a contest ... It 's not the same . Who care 's you know Quixote by heart when you need to fly a spaceship ? . The ship flies itself . Look , if you go , this is as far as we go ... Look ! You know what is it ? . It 's a thread of love from my heart . Wait , let me finish ... , I 'm going out that door and up to the desert to put myself in that sardine can they 're gonna send into space . ... but all that time , we 'll be joined by this invisible thread . Don 't cut it ... I love you . Hello ! - Hi . - Hi , would you like to see something ? I 'm looking at it . You have good taste . It 's lovely . What size do you need ? Does that fit you ? Yes ... It 's my size . Is it a gift ? . - Yes . - Good choice . Magda , the gentleman pays $ 32.00O pesos . $ 32.O00. ? Ana Maria , this little ship flies by miracle over the bitter sky your eyes see ... Only the love I gave you , joins us . If you cut the fragile thread of love , I 'll be lost forever ... in the merciless void . I 'll be lost forever , in merciless space ... Lower the volume of that awful poem , please . I can 't concentrate . Give me something to do , OK ? Calculate speed of M if the weight is A2 and gravity increases 5G times A2 in 100 meters Read the paper , the horoscopes , crimes ... but let me work in peace ! I can 't do pen and paper calculations . I 'm not used to this ! CRAZY BUSINESSMAN FLEES I swear if I find the editor of this newspaper , I 'll kill him ! NEWSPAPER EDITOR 'S OFFICE - " ASTRONAUT IS ORPHAN " ... - He must have a girl ? ... . A little friend ? . According to his colleagues , he never talked about his personal life . " ASTRONAUT IS GAY " ... ? with a question mark ? This guy 's a disaster ! . There 's no way to make news out of him ! Can we at least interview some students ? Alfredo went to interview them , but the students didn 't react very well ... What 's that supposed to mean ? They mugged him inside the school and stole his tape recorder ... He 's recuperating in the hospital . So we have absolutety nothing ! ... Nothing at all ? " JOURNALIST MUGGED BY STUDENTS " ... in red ! Armando , Sir , Jaime Estay is here to see you . Jaime Estay ... are you sure ? Yeah ? He 'll see me ? - Hello . - Come in , man . - You 're not still mad ? - Why would I be mad ? For more than thirty lawsuits for libel I have in the courts thanks to you ? ... Or for trying to extort money from a Senator who also owns half this newspaper ? I just told him there were a couple of pictures that could be published . I can 't leave the country ... I have to sign every day at the Police Station ... Armando , I 'm really sorry ... but now I have something really good for you ... Anotherone ? What could it be ? A hot tip on the horses ? Last time I lost 500 thousand pesos ! I have the astronaut 's girlfriend ! She 's willing to talk pure emotion ... real pretty . I could get some naked photos ... whatever you want ... " ASTRONAUT 'S GIRLFRIEND NAKED " ... Be thankful I came to see you first ... It 's here . Do you have the orbit ? Yes ... but the news isn 't good . Show me ... Shit ! Just what we need ! The gas in the generator probably ran out . I 'll go ... Octavio , meantime , bring the map outside so you can show me where the poor guy is . - Arabs ! - Calm down , not all of them are bad . Arabs , and the bad ones . They are everywhere . - Are you sure ? - Math doesn 't fail . - So if it continues in this orbit ... - Gravity will bring it into the atmosphere let me calculate this ... Thirty years and two days ... What ? You 're not gonna blame me , are you ? You don 't think I feel bad about this guy ? ... Octavio ? What do you want from me ? I should shoot myself in the head ? - Don 't Shoot ! - What the hell are you doing man ! I 'll try to intercept their communications system . First , I 'll take these two down . No ! If they hear the shot , they will blow up the whole place , so we can not take control of the spaceship , - Orders were to kill them . - Orders were to get this ship down far from the US . We will do it my way ! Good Morning The situation here is quite confusing , Tonka There are people in the streets celebrating the heroism of this young astronaut as it if were a sports triumph In fact , the crowd 's excitement is even more than when Chile 's soccer team tied with Brazil Miss ... sorry ... Did I scare you ? ... Are you leaving ? . I need to speak with you a minute please . It 's important . - Are you a journalist ? I have nothing to say . - No , I 'm not a journalist ... If you don 't listen , the press will find out where the astronaut 's girlfriend works . Sorry , I don 't want to pressure you , but someone 's life is at stake ... Look , I 'll drive you to the subway and we can talk along the way . - How do I know I can trust you ? - Look , if I were a journalist , I would have my camera . I 'd be really stupid to miss the story of Chile 's sweetheart . - OK . - Good , let 's go . ... Look , if the information we have is true , we have an unscrupulous businessman who 's putting the life of a young astronaut and our country 's national prestige in jeopardy ... - What 's the government doing about this ? - The Government will take all the necessary measures ... - Including applying the Law of National Security ? - We have not rejected any alternative . - Have the gringos arrived ? - Not yet Idiots ! They sent this guy to his death for sure . - So you 're a journalist after all . - Because of the tape recorder ? . OK , I better tell the whole story . You should 've started from there . How do you think I found you before the press ? I work for Chilean Intelligence ... My mission is to find the Space Center and bring Guillermo home safe and sound . So , I record everything . What you say may be used as evidence . OK ? Can you show me your credentials ? Sorry , but it 's hard to swallow your story ... That 's OK . Look , If you realty think I 'm tying ... get out of the car . Trust your instincts , Ana Maria . Look in my eyes ... Do you really think I 'm lying ? The US Government considers the launch of this satellite an act of hostility . And our country may respond to this agression by any possible means . Good bye . Wait ! Mr.Ambassador , this is a private venture , which does not have our authorization . What I 'm going to say is confidential . That spaceship is a satellite full of toxins , controlled by Al Qaeda ... No , Ambassador , Sir . You 're wrong . Here I have all the information on the project . The most toxic substance on that spaceship is probably a tube of toothpaste . This is the work of a crazy amateur . The spaceship 's crew is one poor guy who was chosen in a TV contest . According to the Chilean Air Foroe , the spaceship is out of control and they don 't know how to get it down ... That 's the real problem ... the astronaut 's life . - It 's clean . - Thanks . I 'm sorry I made you talk about this . I Think it 's good to get it off your chest . Yes . I 'm sorry , but it 's true . Guillermo 's spaceship is heading for the sun . But we can still bring it back . And we 're going to do it , Ana Maria ... I swear we 'll do it . Well , here 's the station . Thanks for the information . Bye . What 're you going to do ? . Ummm ... I can 't say . It 's a secret ... I told you thousands of secrets , things I hadn 't told anyone about my relationship with Guillermo . I 'm going to the desert . I have confidential information about where the Space Center might be located . I 'm going to try to find it ... and get Guillermo back ... Now , out you go . - I know where the Space Center is , too ... - Yeah ... ? Guillermo sent me a letter . It was supposed to be a secret . Near " Inca de Oro " , way up North , isn 't it ? . Yeah " Inca de Oro " ... that 's what I heard too ... Hurry before the subway closes . - I 'm going with you . - No , no ... it 's not necessary . At least I want to say goodbye to Guillermo ... No , really . You 're not trained for this . You 'll slow me down . I 'll send your regards . Now please go now . - No , no ... - Yes , Yes .. - But the rules are very specific about this ... - No one has to know . Ana Maria , get out or I 'll make you get out . Nobody can be stupid enough to send someone to space , in this piece of junk , without a good reason . That 's not the issue , this is preventive defense . - So ? - Nothing , I need to be closer to the antenna . - Look ! There 's nobody , let 's go in ! - No , it seems too easy , it 's suspicious ... Somebody 's coming ... - And now ? . - One second ... Now ? . Great ! That 's it , Octavio ... at least we have monitoring . At least you know where it 's gonna crash ... - Ivan Kurnikov ! - The Russian baby , at last Ivan Kurnikov ... Welcome , welcome ... For me it 's ... a tremendous honor to have you visit our our humble Space Center . A mess of an installation ... though it does make me nostalgic . I bet you bought that rocket from Comrade Kalishnikov . ... bad business that ... It always gave us fuel problems ... - So , I wasn 't the only guilty one here ? - What did you want ? . It was the hest option in budget We started with animals ... dogs , chimpanzees ... But we had a different idea . And what was your idea ? To send the dog later ? . ... only if this guy came back safe ? - Are there communications with the ship ? - Yes , of course . Then stay cool ! It 's key to keeping the cosmonaut calm . He should never know the problems we have down here . - Ivan Sir , can I help you ? . - Yes ... bring me the bottle of vodka from my car . I can 't work when I 'm thirsty ... The chair ... If we leave him alone , it 'll take ... 3O years to get him back . I already know that . Tell me ... Why did you do it ? . - What ? . - Put a man in space . It 's a personal thing . We did it for the competitive spirit . We had to beat the Americans . You ... who were you trying to be at ? Dad , why don 't we have astronauts ? - Because this is a country full of mediocre types ... - What does " mediocre " mean ? - What grade did you get on your test ? . - A " C " . That 's being mediocre . This is a country full of people who just get C 's , like you . We 'll never be able to send anyone into space ... I think Chile can do it . The space race ended with Perestroika . From there the Americans have been competing alone ... Can you imagine anything more boring ? Until you arrived with your absurd project ... Tell me why ? Ivan , Sir , here you have ... Now we can ... I brought you this too . Will you need it ? . That 's what 's gonna help us save our cosmonaut . Stay calm ... I 've faced worse ... There are people working for me , I 'm not alone ... Calm down . Use a minimum of oxygen ... By now there must be an international task force to save me ... Something very curious happened ... there are fireflies ! - What ? . - Fireflies , those bugs with light ... Let 's finish . For god 's sake . Ready ? Or do you think we have plenty of time ? We 're coming , Ivan Sir ... Help me with this ... This Russian hahy , hesides being crazy , is completely alcoholic ... What does he want ? He 's renowned . He knows what he 's doing ... - Everything OK ? - Bring me a telephone . In the meantime , calculate how long before the ship passes this point . - Here ? - Yeah . What 's there ? Maybe I don 't know how to get this poor guy down , but I did think about how to defend myself . Any minute now , this place is going to be crawling with police ... They won 't get us out of here so easily ... - He 's crazy ... but I like him ... - Triumph or die ! Triumph or die ! Well ... triumph or the one who 's going to die ... is Guillermo This is Guillermo Zuniga , the first Latin American independent astronaut ... I don 't know if someday someone will find this message , or if it will float around in space eternalty with all the other space junk . The ship 's equipment isn 't working . I 've lost communications with Earth for some time now And I have no more oxigen ... I don 't know if when someone finds this , my girlfriend , Ana Maria , will still be on Earth ... I don 't even know if she knows what 's happening to me ... No clue if she 's thinking about me in these moments ... as I 'm thinking about Or maybe the fragile thread of love has been cutted ... What 're you thinking ? What do you think ? That 's the worst thing about love ... the psychological dependence on the other ... What do you mean ? That you get hooked ... - Are you married ? - Separated . You have children ? His name is Elvis . He 's big ... how heautiful ... That 's the quality of my work ... Great ! I made you smile .. - You can he funny ... - Yeah , sure ... Sometimes I hate Guillermo . He has a special talent for getting himself into trouble . What 're you doing ? Maybe you won 't be able to have a shower , but ... if it makes you feel better , you can change your underthings . ... If you 'll just accept this gift . How tragic ! I reject the holy sacrament , at the same moment , that she 's offering it to me OK , we 'll leave it at $ 35O , 00O pesos ... She doesn 't want to be interviewed ... OK ? Put this on the air as is ... no introductions . I 'll call you . Bye . Hello , Radio Colon , it 's Jaime Estay ... Hello . Here she comes ! Put me on the air ! . This is Jaime Estay , from where the news begins . Today with the astronaut 's girlfriend , Ana Maria Cumsille Ana Maria Cumsille , girlfriend of the first Chilean astronaut , how do you feel ? . OK . Tired ? Sad ? Fine now , I took a long pee . Oh sorry ... The bra and panties you gave me are incredible . Worth all the money you paid ... thanks for everything . - OK , but let 's change subject ... No , no ... - Do you want some ? It 's good ... Eat ... No , no , no ... let 's focus , Ana Maria Cumsille , girlfriend of the first Chilean astronaut ... How do you feel now that the love of your life is in outer space with all those stars ? Why are you acting so stuffy all of a sudden ? Stuffy ? . Talking about love seems stuffy to you ? . No , the way you asked me is weird . " The stars , love ... " And how should I ask you ? " Why are you so sad , sister ? " Besides being weird , now you 're also being an idiot . Let 's take this another way ... Ana Maria , girlfriend of the first Chilean astronaut ... Do you still like Guillermo after all he 's done ? ... Going off into outer space without your permission . Look ... one thing is to like someone , another is to love him ... It 's not the same ? No ... I can like you , for example , but that doesn 't mean I love you . To love someone is something else all together . You said that you liked me , or ... are you just using me as an example ? Don 't know .. but , with you , I feel comfortable . People are always trying to take advantage of you especialty when your boyfriend is far off in space ... But I can trust you . You 're different ... If at that point ... its orbit is inclined fifteen degrees your cosmonaut will land tomorrow at 10 : 45 AM in the Atacama Desert or at least around here somewhere . Think about it while I go take a leak . - What did he say ? - He went to pee . No ! I mean , how does he plan to land our astronaut ? I 've got no idea how he thinks he 's going to change the ship 's orbit . There 's nothing there . You see ? We 're wasting time . This Russian is totally crazy . If he doesn 't explain what he 's doing , I 'll explode . Calm down , Patricio , please ! Do you rememher the MIR ? Our old and beloved MIR ... There 's our salvation . Get out of here before I blow your head off ... You crazy shit ! If you think that at 94 I 'm afraid to die , you 're mistaken ... Patricio , don 't be a jerk . Put down the gun . The MIR ! Everyone knows the Russians let it fall in the ocean ! They only let a portion of it fall ... The MIR is made of various detachable modules . The smallest module , the JC 26 is still up there ... If the Cold War started again , we 'd begin with an advantage . I don 't know why I 'm listening to this ... The cosmonaut in charge is Dimitri Antonov , an old friend of mine ... He 's been up there for years , bored to tears . Should we make him happy ? Orbital Station MIR , Believe it or Not . - Dimitri ! - What ? - Dimitri , this is your uncle Ivan - Ivan Is that you ? Who else could be ? I remember you were in South America What are you doing in Moscow dear uncle ? How is aunt Venty going ? Your aunt Venty passed away ... And I am in South America and this is confidential ... not even in Moscow can know about it Its about a cosmonaut in problems This will surely he my last opportunity to speak with you . My words aren 't bitter , only disillusioned ... Put here in this historic moment , I will pay with my life for our short-lived dreams of space ... .. the tape has run out ... and the tranquil sound of my voice will not reach you anymore . These are my last words , and I am certain that my sacrifice will be in vain . Atacama Space Center The Sky is for Everyone It changed the course Sir . The satellite is going down in South America , far from the US Sir ! Excellent ! Congratulate our men and bring them back . How do you feel ? Don 't shoot ! I 'm not gonna shoot , It 's me , your partner ... Look , we have the same uniform ... Where am I ? The toxic satellite , Al Qaeda ... don 't you remember ? . - Are we in Afghanistan ? - No , no ... in Chile , Atacama Desert . Don 't shoot ! Hey , whe 're you going ? ... come here ! Call the President and tell him we are out of danger . Impossible to make contact with the President Sir ! What ? . He was supossedly sent to a safe place . A secret place ... We don 't have the slightest idea where he is Sir . - Someone must know ... - Anyone who is code 8 Sir . - Who the hell is code 8 ? - Only a code 9 knows who is code 8 Sir . Captain , are you laughing at me ? No Sir , those are the rules of Armageddon . Call Intelligence now ! Patricio ? What ? The Russian baby did it ! He did it ! Your blessed piece of junk is on its way home . At just the scheduled time . I believe it won 't be necessary to change travel agents after all . " Up to now everything is looking good , " said the turkey going into the oven ... How tragic ! I reject the holy sacrament , at the same Hello ... may I come in ? - Are you OK ? - No ! Everything 's wrong ! The system 's down . I 'll pay you anyways , but your computers don 't work ... Let 's go ! Impossible to work like this ! - How did it go ? - Good ... Very well . Do you know where it is ? Yeah ... well , we have to wait here and they 'll come and get us ... Look ... there 's a hotel . Maybe we can rest a bit . Wouldn 't it be nice , a bed an a shower ? . Hello ! Two rooms ... impossible . We have one room left With a big bed ... You 're lucky . Everything is full . Some tourists didn 't come . Excuse me ... Thanks ... it 's nice ... I have to go . I still have to send an email to the office ... Information about what ? What are we supposed to be doing here ? Working ... I have to continue working . OK . Come back whenever you want I 'm going to rest a little bit . Yeah , I 'll rest too . Actualty , the trip was exhausting ... Too many hours driving ... I 'm gonna lay over my side ... it 's more comfortable ... - Could I put my arm overyou ? - Yes , sure . Excuse me . It 's in ! ... It entered the atmosphere ! How heavy ... Heavy , but beautiful ! I really don 't know what you thought about me , but I don 't want you to continue . I need to tell you something ... You 're very special ... and I wasn 't honest . I tricked you until now ... I wanted to do a story , but along the way , I fell in love ... This is the best ... Do you realize the historic event we 're experiencing ? It reminds me my best years ! MOUNTAINS I feel like a boy ! - We made a mistake . - Just one ? You 're an optimist ! A fatal mistake ! The Andean monntains ! What about the mountains ? I forgot about them ... Gagarin landed on the Siberian steppe , flat as the palm of your hand ... - The mountains here are on the other side . - What ? In Argentina the monntains are at the other side , so I forgot too . But will it pass or not ? This is all evidence ! If you haven 't realized , we just killed this poor bastard ... So if they catch us , they will not condecorate us , we 'll go to prison ... Let 's burn everything ! Ana Maria ! - Ana Maria ... Ana Maria ... I 'm sorry .. - Get away ! What should I do ? Look there is something in the sky ! Stop a bit guys , look ... ! Ana Maria ...

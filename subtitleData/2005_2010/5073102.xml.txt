 - [ Mohinder ] Previously on Heroes : - [ Speaking Japanese ] When I get back , we 'll be together . You came here to get control of your life . It 's another strain of the virus . My blood 's no longer a cure . I 'm going to die ? [ Bob ] Claire is the key that could cure the virus . - I 'm here to ask you to give us Claire . - Touch my daughter , I 'll kill yours . - Then I 'll kill you . - [ Gunshot ] - Please don 't let them take me . - I 'll get us home , I promise ... No , no ! [ Panting ] - Peter ? - I remember everything . [ Speaking Spanish ] See , when I get my ability back , I 'm gonna kill you and your sister . And I 'm gonna take it all . [ Indistinct shouting ] Get on the ground ! On the ground now ! [ Man ] Are you sick ? Are you infected ? - Take them to decontamination now ! - Caitlin ! Caitlin ! Caitlin ! Caitlin ! Caitlin ! - No need to shout . - Adam , I was there . I saw her . Haven 't gone anywhere . You were telling me about time travel and how you were gonna save some girl from some virus . You began shouting her name . No , no , I was in New York City a year from now . I saw Caitlin . I was calling at her to come back with me . Look . [ Adam ] Impressive . I have to keep trying . I can 't leave her to be killed by the virus . What do you know about this virus ? Kills over 93 per cent of the world 's population . - Do you know what the virus is called ? - The ... Shanti virus . That 's what the guy at Homeland Security called it . - Does that mean something to you ? - I knew a woman at the company . Victoria Pratt . She was a biological engineer . On Valentine 's Day , 1977 , she recovered a deadly virus from a sick Indian girl named Shanti . Under company orders , she tried to manipulate the virus into a weapon . I 'd heard the programme had been shut down . Clearly , I was misinformed . [ Peter ] Those are my parents . - Linderman , Charles Deveaux . What ... - Those are the company founders . The virus is their crime . - They 're responsible for this . - Parents sin , children suffer . - That is Victoria . - [ Peter ] We need to find her , Adam . We need to find her . Make her tell us everything that she knows . That 's the only way to stop the virus and save Caitlin . It 's the only way we can save the world . Get the hell out of my house . Noah Bennet was a loyal employee of our company , and , for many years , a true friend . I offer my deepest condolences . - Are those my dad 's ashes ? - You had my husband cremated ? His personnel file was very clear as to how his remains should be handled . - What gives you the right ? - We were only trying to help Claire use her abilities for the greater good . - But Noah 's aggression forced our hand . - He was trying to protect me . In the wake of this tragedy , I feel it 's only fair to honour Noah 's wishes . You will be left alone to lead a normal life . My father is dead . There is no normal . I 'm sorry for your loss . [ Sandra ] Pack your bags . We 're leaving tonight . The next 24 hours are critical . I want you to keep an eye on Claire . It 'd be easier without this thing on my arm . It itches like a mother ! And I thought my little girl was tough . I am , Dad , but I was shot . And my body doesn 't heal itself . I 'm sorry you 're in pain , but none of this would 've happened if you hadn 't lowered your guard . How was I supposed to know that Bennet teamed up - with West , the flying boy ? - Excuses don 't change outcome , Elle . You need to accept responsibility for what 's happened . Can you do that ? Can you regain my trust ? Sure , Daddy . I 'll watch the cheerleader . [ Gasps , panting ] - Mohinder . - Take it easy . Last thing I remember ... You were ... - Did you shoot me ? - I didn 't have a choice . - Why am I not dead ? - You would 've been , if you not for an infusion of your daughter 's blood . - You took Claire 's blood ? - It saved your life . You betrayed me . You went after my family ! You told me this company had to be brought down from the inside . I came to my senses before I 'd done any damage . - What have you done with Claire ? - Claire 's at home , - grieving the loss of her father . - Ooh . - They think I 'm dead . - You put us on this path . With your violence , your paranoia . You have nobody to blame but yourself . - What are you doing with that ? - Your recovery has proven this blood has regenerative properties . I believe it holds the key to saving an woman from a deadly virus . That 's what this company does . - We save lives . - Everything they 've told you is a lie . The company made that virus . They 've been experimenting with it for 30 years . You can 't trust them , Suresh ! Get back here , you son of a bitch ! - Six hundred bucks for a comic book ? - In mint condition . But that 's not why I collect them . I just like the stories . How about this for a story ? Once upon a time , we cash these in and live happily ever after . The end . Hey , if Saint Joan 's a good guy , why is she wearing a hood ? Every superhero has a secret identity . How else could they live a normal life ? Who wants normal ? I 'd be rolling large . Let everybody know who I was . If your enemies knew who you were , then they 'd be coming after you , maybe taking revenge on your family . That 's why Clark Kent wears those glasses . Right . - [ Niki ] Micah ? - Mom , you came back ! [ Both laughing ] Mmm ! I told you that I would . - I missed you every day . - Missed you every minute , every second . - What 's that smaller one ? - Nanosecond . - I missed you that one too . - [ Chuckles ] So where were you , Mom ? I went to a place that helps people like us when we 're sick . - Is it Jessica again ? - No , Jessica 's gone . They all are . - This is about something else . - What is it ? I have a virus . You don 't have to worry . I can 't make you or anybody else sick . - What 's gonna happen to you ? - Do you remember Dr Suresh ? He is working really hard to find me a cure . And , when he does , I 'll get better . - Yeah , but what if he doesn 't ? - He will . I am going to get better , Micah . We are going to have normal life . I promise you . I 've got something to make you stronger . Oh , yeah ? What 's that ? Dad 's medal . The one the mayor gave him for saving that girl from the fire . - It 's in my backpack . - We can 't waste another nanosecond . - What 's wrong , bud ? - It 's my backpack . It 's gone . [ Birds chirping ] It 's beautiful out here , Gabriel . Thank you . - I almost feel normal . - After you see Dr Suresh , you will be . And then Alejandro and I can go back home . What if Alejandro could go home now ? But I need my brother . He 's the only one who can stop me from hurting anyone else . What if you could learn to control your own power ? I 've seen people 's powers grow . Do you love your brother enough to let him go ? Of course . It 's ... It 's just not possible . Well , you 'll never know ... unless you try . We should get back . - You put him through enough , Maya . - Me ? Gave up his life for you , even after you killed his wife . - It was an accident . - Really think he 's forgiven you ? - She was cheating on him . - So she deserved to die ? That 's not what I meant . It 's just ... But you wanted to kill her , didn 't you , Maya ? - Stop it . Let me go . - Where ? Back to your brother ? - He hates you . - [ Panting ] Don 't do this . - Please ! - [ Ragged breathing ] If you can control your power , no more innocent people have to die . - Ahh ! I can 't ! - Help . You 're killing me . Help me ... please . [ Straining ] [ Grunts ] [ Wheezes ] You were right . I did it . [ Hiro speaking Japanese ] Don 't think we should go guns blazing . Tell Victoria the truth . - Ask her where to find the virus . - This woman can 't be trusted . She worked for the company . She locked me up . One glance at me on her path is liable to affect her mood . Fine . I 'll go alone . No . - You lost ? - Hope not . - I 'm looking for Victoria Pratt . - Never heard of her . You worked for the company . In 24 hours , the Shanti virus is released . A year from now , 93 per cent of the world 's population is dead . How can anyone know what happens a year from now ? I 've been there . I 've seen it . A time traveller . You created a virus that kills billons of people . I don 't know how it gets out or where , only that it does . Unless you help me . [ Rifle cocking ] Inside ... Now . [ Speaking Japanese ] [ Alarm ringing ] [ Voice on intercom ] Containment breach in bio-research . Evacuation protocol in full effect . You have betrayed everything we stand for . No , Kaito , I tried to save the world . By releasing a virus that 'd kill billons of innocent people ? When you 're around as long as I have the patterns become clear . War . Disregard for environment . Famine . And it 's only getting worse . Had to make the choice for the greater good . Take him down to lock up , and throw away the key ! [ Alarm deactivates ] [ Kaito ] Are you all right , Victoria ? He was looking for strain 138 . If successful , this place would 've been ground zero for a global pandemic . Thank you for saving us . You need to shut down the programme , Kaito . - Give it to me . - [ Victoria exhales ] This will be taken to the Primatech facility in Odessa . With Adam locked away , it will be safe . Something that dangerous , there is no safe . That virus needs to be destroyed . The other founders would never allow that . Doesn 't that concern you ? Adam had help . Only way he 'd have known what to look for . I suggest you take a few days off before resuming your work . I won 't be a part of this . Not anymore . [ Door opens ] After Kaito and the others were killed , I figured that , sooner or later , someone would come after me . - You look like your mother . - I don 't know anything about this . Last time I saw my mother was a year from now , in a future where the world had been devastated by the Shanti virus . Forgive my paranoia , but I don 't know you . I only knew your parents , and what they were capable of . There was a woman . Caitlin . She trusted me to protect her . Now ... Somehow I took us into the future , and now I can 't get back . So if you just tell me where to find the virus I know that I can save her . You 're looking for a mutated strain , 138 . If it were ever released , it would kill us all . - [ Approaching footsteps ] - She tell you where to find the virus ? Company storage facility in New Mexico . New Mexico ? Company never had a facility ... - [ shotgun blast ] - [ Grunts ] - You don 't understand . - You 're working with him . That 's all I need to know . I knew blowing your head off was the only way to be sure . Better late than never . [ grunts ] Thanks , Peter . Let 's get her up to the house . Alejandro ! [ Speaking Spanish ] Maya ... No . Maya ? Did you tell your brother the good news ? [ Speaking Spanish ] Is something wrong ? This says you murdered your mother . - But I know you didn 't . You couldn 't . - It 's true . I did it . I killed her . [ Speaking Spanish ] When my mother found out what I could do , she didn 't understand . She told me I was a monster . My own mother tried to kill me , Maya . And , as I defended myself , there was an accident . I understand . [ Speaking Spanish ] Alejandro , no ! [ Door slams ] Everything 's gonna be OK , Maya . - I 'll take care of you . - [ Crying ] - Why did you lie to me , Victoria ? - You 're with him . - You 're helping Adam release the virus . - Release the virus ? I 'm trying to find the virus so I can destroy it . Thirty years ago , Adam broke into my lab . I stopped him from releasing the virus so he couldn 't kill everyone . And now he 's trying to do it again . I broke into the lab to prevent you and the company - from putting the world in danger . - You killed Kaito , didn 't you ? And the others . And now it 's my turn . We 're trying save lives , Victoria , not take them . Adam 's a killer . And I guess since you 're helping him , you 're one too . - Like your parents . - Adam helped me escape the company . He saved my brother 's life . But what you did , what you were a part of , that will bring an end to the world . Tell me where I can find the virus , so I can stop it . - Go to hell . - Where is it , Victoria ? [ Victoria thinking ] Primatech Paper ... Odessa , Texas . - Texas . - No ! - Thank you . - I am not gonna let you do this ! - Get away from me ! - We 're not hurting you . - We 're letting you go . - What are you doing ? Wait ! You didn 't have to kill her . She was about to take your head off . There 's no coming back from that one . I 'm gonna get the car . If anyone survives , I 'll tell them I couldn 't have done it without you . [ Woman ] Well ? There was this kid on third street who said he can tell me how much your comics were worth . I figured if you knew how much we 'd get , maybe ... Where are they ? Where 's my backpack ? - It was a set-up . I got jacked ... - [ grunts ] - Micah ! - Damon ! - My dad 's medal was in that bag ! - I 'm sorry ! I 'll get you a new one ! You gonna get me a new dad , too ? - I 'm sorry . - I don 't care ! I hate you ! [ Woman ] Gonna get you cleaned up . I 'm gonna call the police , and you tell them everything that happened . Come on . - We need to get it back . - Nana 's calling the police . Not talking about the police , talking about us . We could get it back . - We have talked about this . - We need to be heroes . Like Dad . Being a hero is what got your father killed . The medal 's gone . I 'm sorry . [ Knock on door ] You all packed , Maya ? [ Both grunting ] I tried to let you go the easy way ... - But you had to be persistent . - I 'm taking my sister . [ Both straining ] - Oh ! - [ Knocking on door ] [ Maya ] Gabriel . Gabriel ! Hey . I didn 't hear you with the water running . Is everything OK ? I have to talk to you . - Yeah ? - You were right . About everything . About me . About Alejandro . - I never meant to come between you two . - He 's my brother . I have to do what I can to protect him . - In time , he will understand . - Of course he will . And , without you , I would still be somewhere in Mexico . - I just want to help you . - You have done that . And so much more . Your mom said you 're leaving tonight . I 've fallen 20 stories . Been stabbed in the head . Crashed a car at 70 miles an hour . I 've even been on fire . But this hurts more than any of that . And it 's not getting better . I 've always gotten better , no matter what , - but this just keeps getting worse . - Can 't stand to see you hurt like this . I won 't be . Not for long . There 's a man who used to work for my dad . He has the ability to erase people 's memories . These are a signal so that he knows to come . He can make me forget I ever had a father . Are you gonna hang those in the window ? How do you know he 's gonna see them ? I don 't know , but I have to do something . You don 't want to forget your dad . Forgetting isn 't the answer . I just wish I could tell him how sorry I am . Micah . Why are you dressed like that ? I know what it 's like to lose someone you love . To wish that you had a piece of them , something solid to hold on to . Anybody tried to steal my mom 's piano , I 'd feed ' em their teeth . - [ Chuckles ] - Look . I know where those kids live . - The ones who stole your backpack . - Gonna help me get back my dad 's medal ? Long as you stay out of the way . Anything crazy happens , I need you safe . - OK , I promise . - Shh . We still gotta sneak you out . Come on . [ Machine beeping ] As we 'd hoped . Claire 's blood has fortified my antibodies . They 're strong enough to defeat the mutated virus . Congratulations . You promised Niki Sanders you 'd find a cure , and you have . And you promised me this company 's viral research would end . In working this cure , I 've been pouring over records that reveal the extent of your programme . You , of all people , should understand what it 'd mean to find a safe way to remove the abilities of dangerous individuals . Here , strain 138 . If the smallest amount were released , it 'd wipe out human civilisation . This strain is locked safely away in our facility in Texas . And , I can assure you , doctor , this company is vigilant about security . Really ? For weeks I operated as a spy within your ranks , undetected . God knows what someone with experience and ill intent could achieve . What can I do for you ? Help me hunt down every strain of virus within this company and destroy them . [ Cell phone ringing ] - Hello . - Niki ? It 's Mohinder Suresh . - Are you still in New Orleans ? - Yes . I think I found the cure , Niki . I 'll bring to you on the next flight . Your nightmare 's over . I don 't know what to say , doctor . Thank you . [ Niki hangs up ] Micah . - [ Static buzzing ] - No one 's home . You should have plenty of time . - You know how to get up there yet ? - Almost . Got it . I just wish it wasn 't so bright . Don 't want people thinking I 'm robbing the place . OK . How did you do that ? I told the lights I need them to be off for a while . - You told ' em ? - Yeah . - What ? - You 're Saint Joan ! You have to stop reading those comic books . Stay here . I 'll be right back . [ Grunts ] [ Hip-hop music plays on car stereo ] - [ Gasps ] - [ Car doors closing ] Y 'all put that gas in that van . Figure out why they 're paying us so much - to torch all these buildings ? - Who cares ? As long as he comes with that cash , we come with the matches . [ Guns cocking ] [ Struggling ] [ Grunts ] [ Sobbing ] I 'm sorry , Dad . I 'm sorry I didn 't listen . I should 've done everything you told me to . If I hadn 't been so selfish , you 'd still be here . I love you , Dad . We 'd better say good-bye . We gotta be in Salt Lake by morning . Come on . This is all happening so fast . I 'm losing everything I care about . Claire ! Oh ! - What the hell are you doing here ? - I came to watch the sunset . Liar ! [ grunts ] - Watch who you 're shoving , Pompom . - Claire , don 't . - This isn 't fair . - [ Chuckling ] Welcome to life . - Come on , Claire , we 've gotta go . - No , Mom , we don 't . We can tell the world what they did . Kidnapped me , murdered my father . You have no proof . No one would believe you . You 're probably right ... I guess I 'm just gonna have to show ' em . I 'll show everyone exactly what I can do . Once the secret 's out , you won 't be able to touch me or my family . You 'll be the ones running . [ Cell phone ringing ] - Hello ? - [ Sylar ] Hello , Mohinder . Sylar ? Where are you ? I convinced the babysitter to take the night off . Don 't worry . I 'm taking good care of the little one . [ Breathing deeply ] - If you touch Molly ... - Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . [ Whispering ] We don 't want to wake her . I brought someone to see you . She needs your help . We both do . See you soon , Mohinder . [ Hiro teleporting , speaking Japanese ] - [ Door opening ] - [ Indistinct chattering ] Doesn 't look like the place where they 'd store a virus that 'd destroy the world . Paper company 's just a front . The good stuff is three floors down . Laboratories , jail cells ... - Hiro ? - Peter Petrelli ? What are you doing here ? Adam Monroe killed my father , and , for that , he must pay . - I can 't let you do that . - Then you have chosen the wrong side . No ! I can 't let you hurt him . [ Shouting ]

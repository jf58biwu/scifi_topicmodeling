 [ Mohinder ] Previously on Heroes : You 're supposed to be a hero ! Ohh ! I don 't think she wants to be my princess . Dr Suresh , can we count you in ? Finally took the bait . They caught up with me in Cairo . - I 'm in . - You and I 'II bring this company down . We are all in grave danger . Our past has caught up with us . No ! - I 'm West . - claire . Are you one of them ? Or one of the others ? I figured that you 'd rather have a real one . - Ah ! - [ Matt ] Need to talk about nightmares . - There 's nothing you can do . - I wanna help you . [ speaking Spanish ] What are you doing here ? Who are you ? What 's your name ? I don 't know . [ grunts ] [ screams , groans ] [ sputtering ] He 's awake . Where am I ? Home . You took something that 's ours . Just tell us where you stashed the iPods . [ panting ] We 'II cut your binds . You 'II be on your way . As square a deal as you 're likely to find . - I didn 't take anything . - Right . With the thousands of shipping containers coming through Cork Harbour , you just happen to be having tea in the one we were sent to rob . I don 't know how I got in there . Might wanna consider remembering , boyo . You 're in a bad spot . Ahh , dang it all . My wedding ring fell in with the eggs . [ gasps ] We do have a colander , dear . No need to be flashy . It 's no big deal . - It isn 't until it gets you noticed . - I can 't even be myself at home ? Bad enough that I have to be all fake at school . We simply asked you to lay low . High school doesn 't work like that . Lay low , you get noticed more . They have metal detectors for people who lay too low . I have to be someone . You know I trust you , claire . I mean , we got you your own car . You know , it ma y be easy for you to pretend you ' re the most boring photocopier in the world , but I can 't not be what I am . Whatever that is . Making copies is not my job . Keeping this family safe is my job . If that means I don 't have time to make you breakfast or I have to dress up in this shirt so that we stay invisible and nobody finds us then that 's what I 'II do . And I need you to do the same . [ sighs ] I forgot how weird it must be for you to play normal after being whatever that was . Don 't you feel sorry for your dad . Compared to the life I had , normal 's a pretty nice vacation . [ liquid pouring ] - Thanks . - You 're welcome . Have a good day . Did you see this ? I knew this would happen . [ sighs ] Kaito . How 'd you know this was gonna happen ? Hey . That 's not the way we do things anymore . No more secrets . That was the deal . This was done by a very gifted artist in New York . Isaac Mendez . Everything he 's ever painted has come true . Except for a series of eight . - I was only given the first . - There 's seven more . - What 's in the others ? - I don 't know . But I 'm gonna find them . - [ indistinct chattering ] - [ sirens wailing ] - Are you waiting on an invitation ? - Oh , no . I 've spent so much time on that side of the tape . - Savouring the moment . - Welcome to the big leagues , detective . Let 's hope you survive . All right , got Kaito Nakamura . Seventy , a Japanese national . CEO of Yamagato Industries . Now , he fell out of the sky onto Central Park West with this in his pocket . That look familiar ? Uh , no . No , I 've never seen this before . Mr Masahashi here is a witness . Says he saw Mr Nakamura being pushed - by someone who went over with him . - Only got one body . Either the killer fell 20 stories , got up and walked away , or flew away . - You know somebody that can do that ? - [ distant sirens ] Ah . We , uh , found a fingerprint on the photo . - Got a match . - Angela Petrelli . We need to bring her right in . Mr Masahashi . You ever seen this symbol before ? Yes . It is a Kanji . - It means , " Great ability , godsend . " - Ability ? It is the crest of Takezo Kensei , a famous hero in Japan . Mr Nakamura used to read the Kensei stories to his son , Hiro . - I need to talk to him . - So do I. [ panting ] [ speaking Japanese ] [ flies buzzing ] You must be sober ! If we don 't go after Yaeko , she 'II be killed ! Who 's Yaeko ? Girl you 're supposed to fall in love with ! The one who hates me ? Before I came back in time and ruined everything , she was supposed to be your princess and you a hero . - You look like a fish when you talk - I promise , if you do this , they will tell the story for 400 years minimum ! Like a giant carp . - Yahoo ! - [ horse neighing ] This video demonstrates the newt 's amazing ability to regrow a completely working limb . But newts are not the only creatures with this talent . Thanks to millions of years of combined mutation , Iizards are capable of cellular regeneration . Like people who can heal themselves ? [ chuckling ] No , not people , claire . Lizards . And raise your hand , please . But it 's possible , right ? For people to be able to do that too ? I mean , theoretically . There 's a Iot of controversial though promising work with stem cells . Might be able to culture organs and limbs for people who need them ? I guess the next step for us is phasing out the extra parts . We 're not using the appendix anymore , or grinding bone with our wisdom teeth . Don 't even need a pinky toe for balance . It 's all just junk in our DNA . I 've read people might have evolved a different code already . - That possible ? - I 'm afraid you are gonna need an advanced degree in genetics to get at those answers . And I hope you thank me in your dissertation . What ? [ water splashing ] Oh , so how 'd you Iike the jet ? A lot better than flying coach , huh ? Didn 't agree to work with you for comforts . - Still , it doesn 't hurt . - I can 't help people with abilities unless I have access to your records and labs . Of course , of course . Right now , I need to get you back on that plane because I have your first assignment here somewhere . I thought you said your company kept its medical samples here . Not samples . A man . In Port-au-Prince . He turned up sick . Weakness , tremors , loss of abilities . He 's dying . - The virus . - Mm-hmm . If there 's another case , could be - some reservoir of infection . - Need you to find out . There have only been two presentations of the disease . Your sister in 1 97 4 , and Molly Walker four months ago . - If there is actually a third case ... - Then it is spreading . I 'II test him . If it 's true , I 'II bring him back as soon as possible . Oh , and , doctor ... As of now , your blood is the only cure for that virus . Try not to get yourself killed . [ speaking Spanish ] [ door creaks ] Bet you were prettier yesterday . I Iike your necklace . What does it mean ? - I wish I knew . - Let 's try an easier one . - What 's your name ? - I don 't know . It 's not your day , is it ? I 'm Caitlin . You know that much now . - Caitlin . - Mm-hmm ? - What are they gonna do to me ? - I don 't know . - Whatever my brother thinks is best . - Your brother ? Did he send you in here ? He 'd pitch an epic fit . Thought I 'd try a kinder tack Thing is , this job , it 's bigger than you and a couple of quid . They pulled it for this man named McSorley . Promised delivery today . What happens if the guy doesn 't get what he wants ? You have to remember something . Anything . A name , a face . First thing I remember is your brother and his crew finding me . Then the big guy came at me and ... And an electrical short blew Tuko on his arse . I heard the story . The spark . - I think it came from me . - [ chuckles ] My hand . - I ... I know that it seems ... - Isn 't possible . I 've just wrung out a Iot of your blood . You don 't have a mark on you . [ kettledrums playing , crowd chattering indistinctly ] [ speaking French ] I do not want your cure . - Without it , you could die . - God gave me a power . I abused his gift , so he took it away . - Now I suffer his judgment . - We should leave it to God to decide . The chances are you carry one of 1 00 viruses I can do nothing about . If you somehow carry this one virus , there is only one cure . The distillation of my own blood , and I was guided to you . Surely that 's a sign . - Just the same as your suffering . - A sign of what ? That God isn 't quite done with you yet . So , my friend , shall we see if he still offers redemption ? [ speaking Spanish ] Ahh ! Vámonos . Vámonos . Vámonos . Uh ! - Hyah ! - [ laughter ] [ grunting ] [ speaking Japanese ] [ Hiro laughs ] [ Hiro laughs ] [ straining ] Keep an eye on him . If he so much as lays an inconsiderate fart , you grab the gun . What am I , 1 2 ? Always . [ grunting ] Come on . Come on . [ gasping ] [ exhales deeply ] Sorry , fellas . Ricky and the boys just left . Aye , I saw . We 're not here for Ricky . Lucky then . I 've just tapped a barrel . Two pints ? Ahh ! Ha ! No , thanks , love . We came for you . - [ knee thuds ] - Ohh ! - [ grunting ] - [ cocks rifle ] [ screams ] - [ bell ringing ] - So ... Iizards , huh ? Tell me you didn 't just time that so I 'd walk right past you . I figured you 'd be more into whales or something . - Unicorns . - You make a Iot of assumptions . - Is my hair really that blonde ? - I think it 's cool , actually . - I 'm sort of into genetics too . - I didn 't say I was into genetics . You don 't have to hide everything interesting about you . Biology is supposed to be our destiny . But people forget ... genes can change . I thought guys like you were supposed to sit at the back of the classroom - and hate everything . - I just found this book By some Indian guy . I can barely pronounce his name . It 's about everything you 're talking about . People who 've evolved . There 's a whole chapter on regeneration . Sorry , I Ieft all my awesome genetic textbook reading for the summer vacation . You should see it . I ... I could bring it over . Get you on your way to your Ph. D. You know , I don 't really care that much . I was just kind of bored in class . - Really ? - Yes , but if you Iike Iizards , that 's awesome . Have fun . And I gotta go home . Where 's my car ? [ speaking Japanese ] [ rhythmic beeping ] Your blood is clearing the viral load . Seems you have this disease after all . How are your hands ? Steady as faith . I prayed your cure would not work . If I prayed , I would have asked the same . The thought of this virus finding you , out here . If it spreads ... So you did not believe what you said . About God sending you to cure me . Trouble believing in any god that 'd allow a pathogen like this to exist . It killed my sister . [ children playing outside ] Seems like it 's becoming even more virulent . With a replication rate this aggressive , you 'd have been dead by morning . The people I work with will want me to bring you in for observation . I have a plane . - You work for people ? - A company . Of course . There 's always a company . Where is he ? Where is the Haitian ? - The Haitian ? Isn 't he in Haiti ? - We 're in Haiti . You 've been out of contact for hours . I was in your office . You gave me an envelope , said a man may have the virus , that I was to cure him . He wouldn 't have been able to take your memory unless the vaccine worked . So ... apparently it did . Full recovery . Thank you , Dr Suresh . My memory ? I 'm sorry . Well , at Ieast we 've contained the virus . We 'II just chalk this up to a rookie mistake . [ speaking Spanish ] [ car engine rewing ] [ indistinct radio chatter ] [ gagging ] [ whispering in Spanish ] [ singing softly ] [ speaks Spanish ] [ up-tempo music plays ] Hey . Five-pound bag of gummi bears . Receptionists love them . A well-stocked candy dish makes them feel popular . Dad , if I told you something , will you promise not to freak out ? My car kinda got stolen . My God , claire . My heart just about stopped . [ sighs ] I know . What 's a stolen car when you 're running for your life ? Not that ... Look , I Ioved the car , and if you ever got me another one , I promise I will never leave it unlocked ever again . You left it ... unlocked ? claire , I have to be able to trust you . Not just with the car , with everything . - I know . I made a mistake . - Can 't afford mistakes . - We 're in hiding , it 's dangerous . - That 's right . Great . I 'm in hiding because of something I can do , - and I don 't know what that is . - You know enough . But I don 't even know how it works . Or what my limits are . If I cut off my arm , would it reattach itself or would I grow a new one ? - Shouldn 't be discussing this . - You 're the only one I can talk to . I could be missing my opportunity to help people . If my skin can grow back after I boil it , maybe my blood can help someone who got burned or who 's sick - I don 't know if I can get sick - Enough ! Yell at me all you want about the car , but this is what I am ! I have kept you out of danger so you wouldn 't have to find your limits . They find you , that 's what they 'II do . Cut you , test you . They 'II push you so far past your capacity for pain you 'II wish you could die . Believe me . You may feel confined here , but this is far freer a cage than the one they 'd put you in . I 've gotta get back to work You and Nakamura . Witness said you had a fight yesterday . We were old friends . Sometimes simple conversations can be misconstrued . Hmm . He said you slapped him . He made an offhand comment about my son 's death . I found it distasteful . You 're a major shareholder in Yamagato Industries . Stock 's been in the toilet for months now . - You think I killed Kaito over money ? - Most common motives are money and sex .. Well , I don 't need the money and I wasn 't sleeping with him . Not for a Iong time . You recognise that symbol ? Yes , it 's the logo of my husband 's law firm . Why draw it across Nakamura 's face ? I don 't know . [ echoing ] Because we did something terrible. and now someone wants revenge . Would anyone want revenge on him , maybe ... on you ? - Who said anything about revenge ? - I want my lawyer . - Who wants revenge , Mrs Petrelli ? - Stand down , Parkman . She cried uncle . [ Angela thinking ] Get out of my head ! Mr Petrelli . - I know you . - Detective Matt Parkman . Met in Texas when you came in to lawyer your brother out of jail . Look , I 'm sorry about Peter . Follow me . I 'II show you to your mother . She 's not gonna want to see me . - Look , I just came to get her out . - Then why 'd she ask us to call you ? She doesn 't have anyone else . - [ Angela screaming ] - Where is she ? ! - [ screaming continues ] - Mom ! - [ pounding on door ] - That 's not possible ! - Stand back-1 - [ screaming continues ] [ grunting ] [ whimpering ] It 's gonna be all right , Mom . It 's gonna be OK . Who did this to you , Mrs Petrelli ? - I ... I don 't ... - [ whispering ] What happened ? What happened ? - Aren 't you gonna say anything ? - About what ? - About those things you did . - I didn 't do anything . Make up a story . Tell me you lost your memory of tonight too , - but don 't pretend I 'm stupid . - [ door opens ] You had to knock the piss out of him , didn 't you ? The fella you put through a wall was McSorley 's son . A sadistic bastard , but his old man loves him . - You made him uglier . - Next time , I 'II leave him - alone with your sister . - Don 't you mouth off to me . You turned a fixable monetary problem into a blood feud . Ricky ! You 're gonna make this right . We 'II do another job . Something big enough we can drop a fat stack on his desk - and get him off our backs . - I 'm not a thief . Maybe not . But you certainly handled those two like a pro . And that makes you something . Now , doesn 't it ? What 's to say I don 't walk out of here ? I thought common courtesy would do it . No ? Then maybe this . You might want this ... Peter . My name is Peter ? Sounds about right , doesn 't it ? Just something I read . This is everything you had on you when we found you . Credit cards , maybe a train ticket . Could even be a love letter . It 's all yours . You just have to help us with one little job . What do you say ... Peter ? Hello ? Mr Kensei ? - Mr Kensei ? - You stole my armour , left me withal . - Who do you think you are ? - I only did it to save Yaeko . And to show that Takezo Kensei is not a drunk , but a hero . - And I did . - You did ? Yes . They 're already telling of your bravery . Ah . And what exactly did I do on this day ? You disarmed 1 1 men and rescued a beautiful girl . I 'm to believe you did all that and took no credit ? [ speaking Japanese ] - All right , Carp , I 'm in . - Really ? Don 't know what brand of fool you are , but listening to you will grant me more reward . - And more of her . - It will ! Make me the hero she sees in me . - As long as you stop drinking . - No promises . Aah ! [ grunting ] Aah ! [ grunts ] [ coughs ] I 'm sorry , Carp . Maybe I 'II be a hero next time around . No ! You cannot die ! [ gasps ] [ door opens ] - [ door closes ] - [ distant siren wails ] [ cell phone vibrating ] - You 're working late . - Night shift . Don 't ask W as it a productive trip ? You should have the answer to that shortl y . - And you didn 't arouse any suspicions ? - I don 't think so . Bob seemed more angry at himself for trusting the professor . They 'll be watching me more closely now . That 's to be expected . Don ' t worry . I 'll find the other paintings myself . Are you sure ? You 've given me everything I need . W elcome to Copy Kingdom . How can I help you ? [ man ] When I checked her pedigree . - she ended up having 1 7 champions ... - [ woman ] Oh. that 's just ... - [ up-tempo music plays ] - Turn that off . That is salt in the wound for poor Mr Muggles . I 'm sorry . That was very inconsiderate of me . - [ turns TV off ] - [ barking and growling ] You 're right . It doesn 't help to avoid it . - [ TV turns back on ] - [ music and indistinct commentary ] Well ... Guess it 's just you and me . [ sighs ] Ahh . [ winces ] Come on , grow back - No way . - [ dog barking ] [ barking ] [ barking ] [ barking ]

 My name is Jane Vasco . I could use you on my team . I work for a secret government agency that hunts Neuros . People who can do dangerous things with their minds . On my first assignment ... something a little weird happened , okay , something really weird . Until I get some answers I 'm getting on with my life , doing my job ... stocking up on aspirin ... because I gotta tell ya , pain 's a bitch ! MAGICIAN 'S PALACE He 's actually pretty good . It 's child 's play . Cheap tricks . Maybe . All any of us have to do is ... better . - So , what 're you guys doing tonight ? - Levitation . Wow , ambitious ! But ... isn 't there something in the rules against that ? I don 't recall any rules about that . Yeah , the rules strictly prohibit any pre-rigging of the stage . - How you guys 're gonna set up your wire rig ? - Wire rig ? Yeah . How else are you going to perform levitation ? Magic . Next , Howard Morris . The amazing Howie ! Marcia ! Gentlemen , as you know , the rules for tonight 's audition strictly forbid any use of stage apparatus . I assure you gentlemen , there is none . And now , if you expected any gimmicks , prepare to watch in wonder ... as you experience true magic . True magic . What do you make of that , Andre ? PAINKILLER JANE 1x14 " THE AMAZING HOWIE " Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries Some things carry over from childhood . Okay , using my teddy bears for target practice , wasn 't particularly childlike . But I knew what I wanted to do when I grew up . For some kids it was music , others wanted to be police officers . And sometimes our childhood dreams don 't work out the way we planned . Come to think of it , entering the subway in the morning , feels kind of like going into a kid 's secret clubhouse . Only in adulthood , the other kids in the clubhouse ... are professionals on a team ... Well , at least we pretend we are . Morning . - Is it ? - Have you been here all night ? What are you working on ? Maybe I don 't want to know . Last night I saw a woman levitate into the air . And then you woke up ? It wasn 't a dream . It was a magic trick . - I see . - Jane , I know this trick . Ok , I know how it 's done , but this guy , Howie , he didn 't do it like that . I mean this woman , she really levitated . - Okay ... - What is okay ? What the heck is okay about a real live human female levitating , with no gimmicks involved , nothing ? I 'm sorry . Jane , don 't you see what this means ? No , what does it mean ? Oh , great . Either this guy Howie is smarter than I am , which we all know is impossible , or it 's something else that should be very obvious to all of you . Howie 's a Neuro . Because he performed a magic trick that you can 't figure out . There 's no other explanation . Mental meltdown , yours ? - Ok , guys , you weren 't there last night . - Where exactly is there ? The Magician 's Palace . It 's a very exclusive club . Once a year , they hold auditions for amateur magicians who want to join . And what were you doing there ? Research . Is there something that came up on your radar that I 'm unaware of ? No . I just figured , you know , the more we know the better prepared we are . Yeah , you know , boss , just in case a Neuro wants to saw one of us in half . Hey , boss , I know we were dealing with a bunch of comedians . How 'd the tryout go , Ri ? - Who said anything about me trying out ? - Wait a second . You do magic ? - Why am I not surprised . - Ok , yes ! I do magic , ok ? And last night I made it to the final round of auditions . And so did this guy , Howie . Ok , boss , This trick that he did , it was impossible . - Or just a really good trick . - No . No , I mean , I 've been working on this thing all night . - There 's only one explanation . - He 's better than you . Are you guys dense ? You guys can 't even spot a Neuro when all the evidence is right there in front of you . Well , maybe we need a volunteer from the audience to help us out . Madam , you , you come help us please ! Okay , it 's not going to be on my shoulders , when Howie 's powers escalate , ok ? I mean , who knows what he 's capable of . - Yes , just , Connor , shut up . - Yeah . This is not enough evidence to move forward . You 're gonna have to let it go . Oh , if only the blind could see . We 've got a new lead on that ... what did you call it ? It 's a shape-shifter - Right , the one we lost in Virginia ... Right now that 's top priority . Let 's roll . Boss , when we find this guy , you chip him . We 'll get Riley to pull a quarter out of his ear . Ok , I heard that ! He pet . oh ! - Hi . - Hey ! How we ... - Looking for this ? - Look , I realize that probably shouldn 't be here . No . You really shouldn 't . Look Howie , I 'm really sorry . It 's just ... I got so nervous about tomorrow 's audition , I know you 're going to have something amazing , I just came here to find what I 'm up against . You 're that desperate to get into the magician 's palace ? - Yeah , it 's pathetic , I know . - I could have you disqualified . If I were you , I would . Everybody makes mistakes , Ri . May the best man win . Really . Okay . Thanks . Hey , Ri . Any hot dates float your way ? - What do you want ? - I need a favor . Can you hack into Seth 's database ? Yes . Why would I want to ? Seth ran some tests on me last week , and every time I ask for the results , he says he doesn 't have them yet . Well , I think he does and he 's keeping something from me . - I just want to know the truth . - Okay ... why would I want to ? - I 'll owe you one ? - You already owe me one . Besides , I 'm busy . I got to prepare for my audition . Which I 'm not going to win because Howie is a Neuro . Okay , okay . I wouldn 't ask if it wasn 't important . My job 's important . - Besides , if Andre finds out about this ... - All right , fine . Don 't help me . I 'm just the girl who can heal from anything . Jane , wait ! - I 'll make you a deal . - I 'm listening . I 'll get the test results from Seth . But you have to do me a favor in return . And what might that favour be ? - You can 't be serious . - Quit your complaining . This is what all the best assistants are wearing . So , you got your stuff covered ? You know what to do ? Riley , if you make me go over this one more time ... I just want to make sure it goes off without a hitch . Oh man , these judges are going to be blown away . - I thought that was my job . - Ladies and gentlemen , Riley Jensen . How do I look ? It 's show time ! For my next illusion , I 'll need some help from my lovely assistant , Jane . A 38-caliber revolver . Please examine it to confirm that hasn 't been modified in any way . The ammunition , please . And if you wouldn 't mind loading it , sir . Solid steel , six inches thick . Are you satisfied that the gun and the ammunition are genuine ? They appear to be . Excellent . Is this , in fact , a spent 38 caliber slug ? It 's still warm . And there 's blood . Very impressive , Mr. Jensen . Howard Morris . All the best assistants are wearing them ? Wait . If I may ... The illusion I had planned will pale in comparison to Riley 's , so instead I 'd like to repeat what you just witnessed , and turn it up a notch . - Howie , you can 't do this . - It 's the ultimate challenge , performing another magician 's trick with no preparation , no rehearsal , and the same props . Howie , you don 't understand . It 's Jane ... she ... - She knows the trick ! - I have Marcia . No , but Marcia , she ... Look , please Howie , you can 't do this . Look , he cannot do this trick . Each entrant is entitled to perform the illusion of their choosing , Mr. Jensen . But you don 't understand , he 'll kill her ! No ! Bravo ! Well done ! You walked out on me . After I put on the star spangled tap dancing costume ... and let you shoot me in the gut . I think I held up my end of the bargain . - So , you didn 't see what happened ? - What was there to see ? - You won , Howie lost , case closed . - No . Howie won . But how is that possible ? Because he did the same trick . With my gun and with a normal assistant ! I was talking about Marcia . You know what I mean . - But that 's impossible . - Yeah ? Not , no , for a Neuro it isn 't ! Ri , you 've got to let this go . Yeah , what if I get a DNA results ? - Would that finally convince you ? - I 'm serious . You 're going to get yourself in trouble if you keep obsessing about this guy . All right , fine . I won 't ask for your help any more . Riley ... My end of the deal . I got into Seth 's computer . You were right . He has the results of your tests . And are you going to share ? You can take a look yourself . It was written in doctor-ese mumbo jumbo . I have no idea what it means . Then I guess I 'm gonna have to ask someone who does . - You lied to me . - I 'm sorry ? You lied to me . - About what ? - My test results . You told me you didn 't have them yet . Did you break into my files ? Is that bad ? Do you think I can 't handle it ? Jane , the results aren 't bad at all . They 're just surprising . - Andre thought ... - You talked to Andre ? Yes , he agreed that I should recheck my procedures ... and look for any possible errors before telling you what I found . - Which is ? - All right , you remember taking an IQ test in high school ? Since then , your score has gone up ... by 35 points . - And ? - Well , that simply doesn 't happen . Someone might gain five , or even ten points at most . But a jump like yours it 's astonishing . The amazing Jane . It 's hardly bad news . Your spatial processing , pattern recognition , analytical skills , short and long-term memory they 've all vastly improved . - The question is why ? - I 'm not sure , but it 's ... possibly related to your healing . You see , in a normal brain , neurons are forming new connections all the time , but most of those die off ... unless they 're reinforced through practice and repetition but yours ... yours seem to survive . Can 't believe you broke into my files . So what happens now ? I just ... keep getting smarter until , what , my brain explodes ? I wish I could tell you but ... this is uncharted territory for both of us . But I think the chances of cranial detonation are low . Thanks . That 's reassuring . No problem . Now , I 'll just reset my password . A toast to the newest member of the Magician 's Palace . - Congratulations . Thank you . I really appreciate you coming tonight . I know I haven 't exactly been a gracious loser , but I 'm telling you , the trick you did last night was mind-blowing . Come on , Riley , you can drop the act . What do you mean ? You know exactly how I did the trick with the gun , because you did it the same way . You got to wonder how many of us there really are out there . How many of us ... what ? Real magicians . People who don 't need gimmicks or slight of hand ... People who can truly perform magic . Right . Right , true magic , yeah . I mean , I didn 't want to be the first person to say it . You know how some people are . - I thought I was the only one . - No , no , no , no . There 's ... Well , me and my dad . When did you first know that you were ... special ? After I inherited my dad 's wand . I 'd been studying magic all my life but ... I only got good enough to do birthday parties or amateur nights , but I was just doing the same fake tricks as everybody else . But after I got the wand , it 's like the conduit of real magic , Everything changed . You should 've seen my face when that first rabbit actually materialized in that hat . - That must have been something . - Yeah . So , what about you ? When did you first , you know , achieved your gift ? My gift , yeah . - Could I get some more ... - Oh , god ! - Spilt my water ... I 'm sorry . - Everything all right ? Fine . - We 'll clean it up right away . - That would be great . - Are you okay ? - Did I get you ? Don 't worry about it , it 's okay . I 'm sorry . I 'm just ... No , it 's okay . What were you saying ? What was I saying ? - Oh , about my gift . - Yeah . Yeah . Well , I was walking in town , Chinatown actually , I was in Chinatown . And there was this little store , This little store , and I went inside and there was this statue , a Buddhist statue . And the owner , he didn 't want to sell it to me , right ? But there was something about it . I just felt like it was meant for me . You know what that feeling is like , right ? - I did not really know . - Not really know . Well , anyway , one thing led to another , I convinced him to sell it to me . Buda-bing , buda-boom , that was that . Gift . - Did you switch cups ? - What ? No . No . - Are you trying to drug me ? - No , of course not . I am not trying to drug you . You 're after my wand . No . I 'm not after ... I thought you were a kindred spirit , Riley . - I thought I could trust you . - No , but you can trust me . Ok , I don 't want your wand ! The truth is I work with some people ... that might be able to figure what 's really happening to you . I know exactly what 's happening to you . Howie ? ! Howie ? ! Howie ? ! Ahhhh ! Howie ! Howie ! Howie ! Seth , I need you to run a DNA sample . On what ? You 'll see here . - Egg shells ? - Yeah . You 've encountered the first Neuro chicken , have you ? Cute . These came out of Howie Morris ' mouth . So , basically all you need to do is get a saliva sample and run the test . Right ? - Well , theoretically . Ok , then let 's do it . Riley , I can 't do anything without Andre 's authorization . Give me a break , Andre ? We don 't need to let him know . I mean , we just run the DNA tests and that 's it . Sorry . Do you ... Do you want to take your magic egg shells with you ? ... one of my team members has the right to follow hunches ... The right to follow their intuition , but when we are working on a single case , Riley , I need you to keep your head in the game . You want to follow this up ? Do it at home ! Hey ! - He 's still on the magician thing ? - Yeah . Now he wants a DNA test on an eggshell . - Why not let him have it ? - Why , you think he 's onto something ? No . But you know Riley . He 's not going to let this go until he gets proof , one way or the other . We have confirmed cases , they take priority . Yes , we need Riley on those confirmed cases . And while he 's got his head wrapped up in this , he 'll be so distracted that ... He 's a professional , he 'll have to get over it . - I agree . - Good . That 's why I 'm saying , why not show him the results from the DNA test , and when they come back negative , we can get back to business as usual . - Waste our resources to humor Riley . - it 's a favor for a friend . And before you argue with me , let me remind you ... that new and improved IQ number in my file ? It 's higher than yours . Who 's there ? It 's Riley . What do you want ? Listen , Howie , I just want to explain what happened at the restaurant . Ok ? It 's not what you thought . You wanna come in ? Thanks . Riley be gone ! Why don 't you go over his place and look around ? I 've already been there . The lunatic 's probably off on his Neuro hunt . Actually , that lunatic might be in a bit of trouble . Those eggshells tested Neuro positive . It 's clear . No sign that he 's been here . You gotta wonder what this Howie guy could 've done to him . For all we know he could be levitated over the East river by now . I 'm glad you find this amusing . - He is a Neuro ! - I know , but , c 'mon ! What 's the guy gonna do ? Pull a rabbit out of his hat ? We still got to find him . And Riley too . Howie , what have you ... ? - Where are we ? - The Magician 's Palace . If you 're thinking of calling for help , don 't bother . This whole wing is being renovated . - What did you do to me ? - The disappearing sack trick . I wish you could have seen it . It was very impressive . What did it feel like ? Why don 't you try it on yourself and find out ? You know , I didn 't want it to come to this . But you didn 't give me much of a choice . Lying to me , trying to steal my wand . And who are these " people you work for ? " Government ? Military ? People who want to use my gift for their own nefarious purposes ? It 's not like that . I know why you 're doing this , Riley . Is because you 're jealous . Because I 'm the real McCoy . You 're not the real McCoy , Howie , you 're not a magician . You 're cheating . - Cheating ? - Illusions take time and skill ... years of practice . Your " gift " just fell in your lap . Hey , I earned this . I spent my entire life proving myself worthy of my father 's legacy . This wand is my reward . Enough with the wand , it 's a stick . And it has nothing to do with your ability . What would you know about it ? You 're what we call a Neuro . You have a genetic mutation and that 's what gives you your power . - That 's absurd ! - It 's what my team does . We track down Neuros . Some can control people 's minds , start fires ... bring back the dead . You , you can do magic . - You 're delusional . - It 's in your mind , Howie . Your father 's wand just gives you the confidence that you need . No ! Your magic , when did it begin ? After my dad died , I didn 't have the heart to perform for a while . When I started again , I decided to use his wand in my act as a kind of a ... as a tribute . Nothing special happened , not for weeks . When that rabbit first appeared in the hat , I hadn 't changed anything . I didn 't do anything different , I didn 't even eat a decent breakfast . So you thought of the wand . I would have done the same . I thought maybe it didn 't work at first because ... I was out of practice , or I wasn 't good enough . And when the real magic came , I thought maybe it was ... a final gift from my father , to show that I deserved it . Now you 're telling me that 's not true ? That the only thing my father left me was ... an old stick with chipped paint . And that if it wasn 't for some random mutation , I 'd still be ... a marginally talented hack pulling a quarter out of nine years old 's ear . That 's what you 're telling me ? Yeah . Pretty much . Okay , I 've got Howie 's recent credit card activity . Mostly online purchases of books and magic supplies . - Several charges for pizza delivery . - What a life ! - Plane tickets ? Car rentals ? Hotel rooms ? - No . Come on , what would genius boy do to find himself ? Think ! Wait ! Try checking traffic cameras near Howie 's apartment . That 's a great idea . I have no clue how to do that . Come on ! Even with that oversized IQ of yours ? Since none of you guys were taking me seriously , I had to take matters into my own hands . If you 're watching this , it means I 've been missing now for about twelve hours . If I were sitting there , with you guys , which I 'm obviously not , I might be able to help you . So ... He 's thorough . You gotta give him that . I 've hooked up my heat signature to the database ... and linked into N.S.A. ' s satellites . The red dot you see should indicate where my location is . Hopefully one of you guys can read a map ... and I 'm not at the bottom of a river somewhere by the time you get to get this . So come find me . Where is that ? I 'd say it 's way at the end of Old Post road . Let 's rock and roll . Maybe you 're right . Maybe my abilities did come from some ... mutant gene . The thing I 'm realizing , Riley is ... it doesn 't matter . It doesn 't matter ? Of course it matters . Why ? - Because you 'll know the truth . - But magic is all about hiding the truth . - Using an illusion to complete the trick . - Your life isn 't a trick , Howie . If you have a genetic anomaly , it needs to be dealt with . Dealt with ? What do you mean ? Riley , how would you like to spend the rest of your life in a rabbit cage ? - We can chip you ! - Chip me ? It 's a small chip that emits an electrical charge . - That puts an end to my magic ? - It 's not magic , Howie . My whole life , I grew up watching my father bring a sense of ... mystery and wonder to people 's lives . Finally , I can do the same . I don 't understand you or your team , Riley . Why would you want to " chip " somebody like me ? I 'm not dangerous . It 's not what we want . It 's just over time we 've realized that every Neuro is potentially dangerous . Why ? Because I 'm different ? Because I can do things that most people can 't ? The same about Einstein or Hawking . And what about Mozart ? He was composing when he was four . You gonna chip him too ? Somehow , I doubt that Mozart was a Neuro . What if he was ? You know what your problem is , Riley ? - I 'm still tied to a chair ? - You 're scared . Scared ? Scared of what ? Anything . Anything you don 't understand . Instead of enjoying the ride , you try to figure it out and make it all logical . Of course . It 's probably why you love your computers so much . - They 're reliable . - Is that all that matters in life ? Reliable ? What about the joy of mystery ? Love ? Don 't you remember the first time you saw someone turn a tiger ... into a beautiful woman in the blink of an eye ? Before you started calculating it and explaining it all to yourself ? Wasn 't there a moment where your jaw dropped ... and your heart stuck in your throat and all you could think of was ... Wow . You want to take that away ? From children ? From adults ? From yourself ? - My heat signature ! - Excuse me ? Howie , you nee to go . You need to get out of here . - Why ? - My teammates , they 'll be coming . I gave them a way to find me . You have to go now ! - Conner , wait ... ! - Ahhh ! You can 't hold me . Into thin air ! Into thin air ! Into thin air ! No ! Yes ! Riley , - ... you okay ? - Yeah . Great . - We made a mistake ! - Yes . I was just about to say that we should have trusted your instincts more . Good job . Howie is not a threat . Ok ? We should de-chip him and let him go . De-chip ? Is that possible ? The doctors at NICO have done some surgeries . It 's not conclusive but they 're suggesting it 's possible . There 's a step backward for the world . - And why would they want to do this ? - I don 't know . It 's not my department . If anyone deserves to be de-chipped it should be Howie . He 's harmless . He just wants to make people happy . He 's a Neuro , Riley . The path to hell is paved with good intentions . Howie 's only on the path to the Magician 's Palace . Sorry , we can 't take the risk . Then you better chip me , too . What are you doing ? ! You see , you can take the risk . There 's always a choice . But then , you might need me to save your asses . Again . - That 's not funny . - The debate is over . Howie is chipped and he goes to NICO . Connor . Thanks for trying . Is there any way you could de-chip him on your own ? No . Seth would have to operate , and ... you know Seth . Without Andre 's authorization ... What ? When I first joined the team , Seth and I we ran some tests on the Neuro chip , to find out if anything might disrupt its function . - And ? - If I can create ... - ... a strong enough electromagnetic field . - Can you do that ? If anyone can ... This is your deal , Riley . You 're on your own . - You got a pick up for us ? - Yeah . - When did this happen ? - Last month . They upgraded everything . They 've already been chipped , they don 't pose any threat . I don 't make the orders . I drive the freaks . Where is it ? What do you want ? Look , I 've got to get you out of here . Why bother ? You 've taken away the one thing from me that ever truly mattered . You think I could ever go back to a normal , boring , life ? It 's not that bad , is it ? Only by comparison to a world filled with magic . I think I can disable your chip . What ? Just get ready . For what ? Trust me . Howie ! Howie ! Howie ! Are you okay ? You 've electrocuted me ? We don 't have much time . Try your magic . Try to disappear . - It 's no use . - No , you want to try ! Please , try it . Come on . I will vanish ... Now ! You need to concentrate . Okay ? Look , just pretend like I 'm the audience . Ok , Howie , amaze me . Amaze me ! Come on , Howie ! I can 't . The chip 's still working . The jolt that I gave you has got to work . I 'm telling you I can 't ! - I 've got to get you out of here . - Don 't , don 't ! - I 'm willing to accept my fate . - Yeah , well , I 'm not . Come on ! - What is this place ? - Someplace I have to get you out of . What the hell happened here ? What do you know about this ? I don 't . And where the hell is Riley ? Come on , Howie ! We have to hurry ! Howie , you need to try it , try it again ! - Riley , I told you that ... - Howie , we 're running out of time ! Take this . Just try again for your dad . Come on . The amazing Howie will now ... be gone ! Riley . Hey , boss . Beautiful day , huh ? Where 's Morris ? Howie ? Isn 't he in his cell ? You know damn well he 's not in his cell ! No , I have no idea . How does a chipped Neuro get out of his cell without setting off security ? Magic ? Magic . It always amazed me how Riley was able to pull a rabbit out of his hat ... when it came to computer information , I never dreamed he was able to do it literally as well . In the end Howie was right , it didn 't matter to the non-magicians in his audience how he did his tricks . They were there to be entertained and amused .

John once told me it 's inscribed onNthe front of the Temple of Apollo . know thyself and thou shall know all the mysteriesNof the gods and of the universe . " That 's quite a mouthful . My version is this . Know thyself because whatNelse is there to know ? People hide secrets . Time is a lie . The material world canNdisappear in an instant . It has and it will again . Ms. Baum . Our identities change . Nhow we act and speak . We 're shape shifters . There is no control . No constant . No shelter but the love ofNfamily and the body god gave us . And we can only hope thatNthat will always be enough .

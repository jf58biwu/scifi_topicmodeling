 [ Laughs maniacally ] [ Mechanical breathing ] [ Laughs maniacally ] What in the [ bleep ] is ... Palpatine : [ Chuckles ] So I threw the senate at him . [ Laughter ] The whole Senate . True story ! Oh , my God , that is so funny . [ Laughing ] You made it come out of my nose . [ Telephone rings ] Palpatine : Go for Papa Palpatine . You have a collect call from ... Vader : [ Mechanical breathing ] Darth Vader . Palpatine : [ Sighs ] I got to take this . Hold on . Vader , how 's my favorite Sith ? Whoa , whoa , whoa . Whoa . Whoa . Just slow down . Huh ?

Are you [ bleep ] me ? Well , where are you ? Wait a sec , you been flying around for two weeks trying to get a signal ? You must smell like feet wrapped in leathery , burnt bacon . Oh , oh , oh , I-I 'm sorry . I thought my dark lord of the Sith could protect a small thermal-exhaust port that 's only two meters wide . That thing wasn 't even fully paid off yet . Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to my credit ? [ Telephone rings ] Hang on . What ? ! I 'm very busy right now ! Oh . Oh , well , where are they going ? Oh , all right . Um , just get me a turkey club . Uh , cole slaw , I guess . I 'm not even gonna eat it . What are you getting ? No , see , I always order the wrong thing . No , no , no , I 'll just stick with that . Okay , bye . W-what ? Oh , cherry coke . Thanks . Sorry about that . [ Sighs ] What ? Oh , oh , " just rebuild it " ? Real [ bleep ] original . And who 's gonna give me a loan , jackhole ? You ? You got an ATM on that torso lite-brite ? Now get your 7 ' 2 " asthmatic ass back here , or I 'm gonna tell everyone what a whiny bitch you were about Padamami or Panda Bear or whatever the hell her name is . Oh , jeez , he 's crying . [ Chuckles ] Hey , hey , hey , hey . Come on , come on , don 't do that . Just ... just ... look , I 'm just dealing with a lot of crap right now . Death Star blown up by a bunch of [ bleep ] teenagers , you know ? I didn 't mean to snap . O-okay , just get back here . Okay . Okay , bye . Y ... I ... I love you , too . What 'll it be , pal ?

[ Alarm buzzes ] C-3PO : Oh ... Oh , dear . My keys . [ Chuckles ] Qui-Gon : It 's almost open . Hold on to this . Whoa , coming through ! The wall 's on fire ! [ Elephant trumpets ] What was that ? It was a lightsaber ! This is my first day ! [ Car alarm blares ] Vader : What the ... Little help ? Welcome to orientation day here on the jolly , old Death Star . There are a few things we want to go over with you concerning Lord Vader . First and foremost , he thinks he has the power to strangle us . Truth is , he doesn 't . If he ever realized this , he would kill us with his lightsaber . Thus , to keep us safe , we 'll all pretend to get strangled . Okay , let 's try a practice . Commander Winston here will assist me . I 'm going to hold out my hand like Lord Vader , and he will pretend to be strangled . Gasping for air . Grabs throat , yes . Eyes back , and he 's down . Good show , commander . Now two of the floor chiefs will retrieve the corpse , redress him , add a mustache , and he 's back to work as lieutenant Leopold . Vader has the satisfaction of killing someone , and we stay amongst the living . Why , private Perkins over there has been strangled over 30 times , haven 't you , Perkins ? [ Laughs ] Good man . Luke : Yeah ! This is awesome ! R2 , patch me through . I want to call Uncle Owen and Aunt ... Ohh . [ Elevator bell dings ] [ Gasps ] You 're George Lucas ! George : Uh , I take it you 're here for the " Star Wars " convention ? I sure am . Want to see my costume ? George : Um ... See ? I 'm a tauntaun . But I don 't have to tell you . You invented tauntauns . George : Well , that 's very interesting . Listen to my tauntaun call ! [ Growling ] [ Elevator bell dings ] George : Nicely done . Oh , dear God . Oh , my God ! George Lucas ! I love you ! Give me a baby ! Quickly , sir ! Onto my back ! I am your steed . George : Uh ... I have a bad feeling about this . [ Growling ] George : Oh , dear God . [ Crowd gasps ] George : Oh , well , um ... And I thought they smelled bad on the outside . [ Laughter and applause ] Just like in the movie ! Me ? Thank you ! Thank you ! And that was the greatest day of my whole life . What about when I was born ? Not even close . Luke : But with the blast shield down , I can 't even see . How am I supposed to fight ? Ooh ! Ooh ! [ Roars ] Oh , damn it ! What is it ? I never get a spaceship . I never get anything . Should we order some Chinese food ? I don 't know , I guess . We 'll get some Chinese . [ Telephone dialing ] Hello , could we get , um ... What do you think , 5 million tons of Kung Pao chicken ? That 's good . Yeah , 3 million pot stickers and one order of scallion pancakes . Get some fried rice . 5 million tons of fried rice . Cash or charge ? It 's ... Hold on . We 're just gonna gobble him up when he gets here , right ? Yeah , of course . Cash , then . Mace : [ Screaming ] That mother ... [ Sighs ] I got to get that transfer to the Death Star . Mr. President , your vitals all check out fine . There is just one thing .

Bush : Boring . Let 's fight ! Pres . Lincoln : If you strike me down , I shall become ... Wait , let me finish ! Aah ! Pres . Bush : That 'll teach you , George Washington ! Jenna , get over here right now ! I am your father ! Jenna : That 's not true . That 's impossible . My real father would let me go clubbing as late as I want ! Pres . Bush : You little ... Jenna : Ow . Pres . Bush : Oh , no , baby , I 'm sorry . Jenna : Aah ! You suck ! Pres . Bush : Nooooo ! [ Snoring ] What ... Huh ? Was it just a dream ? Mr. President , we still haven 't found any weapons of mass destruction . Pres . Bush : You have found weapons of mass destruction . Uh ... Hi . We haven 't . Pres . Bush : You have . I don 't know what you 're doing . Pres . Bush : Bring me a taco . Yes , sir . Pres . Bush : Tacos rule . Cloud city will be cloudy this evening , followed by clouds . Get your own tauntaun ! Luke : Your overconfidence is your weakness . Palpatine : Your faith in your friends is yours . Luke : Faith in yo mama . Palpatine : What was that ? Luke : I said , yo mama 's so fat , Jabba the Hutt said , " da-a-a-mn ! " Palpatine : Well , your mother 's so ugly , she put the " ug " in ugnaught . Vader : Oh , yo mama fight ! Luke : Yo mama 's so stupid , she spent all day saying , " am not , " to r2 . [ Crowd shouts ] Palpatine : Your mother is so fat that Ben Kenobi said , " that 's no moon . " That 's your mama ! " [ Crowd shouts ] Luke : Yo mama 's so dumb , she thought Jar Jar comes with pickles pickles ! [ Crowd shouts ] Palpatine : Your mother is so stupid , she ... she thinks a lightsaber has fewer calories . [ Crowd murmurs ] I don 't get it . Palpatine : It 's light . Like it 's light . Like , light means that there 's not a lot of calories and it 's good ... For your body . That 's how stupid your mother is . Luke : Yo mama is so stupid , she went to Bangkok to get a tie fighter . And Luke wins ! Palpatine : What are you doing ? What are you doing ? ! Put me down ! [ Screaming ] Oh , come on . What are they doing up there all the time ? What 's happened up there ? Han : Uh , we had a slight weapons malfunction , but everything 's perfectly all right now . We 're all fine here now . Thank you . How are you ? We 're sending a squad up . Han : Negative . We had a reactor leak here now . Give us a minute . Large leak , very dangerous . There 's no reactor on that floor . Han : Yes , well ... I talked to Dave Johnson in stormtrooper engineering , and he said there is a reactor here . Dave Johnson ? Hang on one second . Okay , I have Dave Johnson on the line . Dave , did you tell someone there 's a reactor in prisoner control room ? Dave : Uh , no , there 's no reactor there . Han : I don 't know what to tell you , but I 'm staring straight at a reactor . Maybe Vader had it installed yesterday . Hang on a second . Vader : What do you want ? Lord Vader , did you install a reactor in the prisoner control room ? Vader : Um ... Not that I know of . Hang on one second . Sheila , can you get me the plans to the Death Star ? Okeydokey , the plans here ... Let me have a look . [ Singing indistinctly ] Reactor , reactor , reactor . No reactor that I can see , but might as well put one in . There 's always room for another reactor . We 'll send a team up to build the new reactor . Han : No , not necessary . We 've got it under control . Boring conversation anyway . Okay , let 's build this reactor . Vader : Inform the emperor that the Jedi temple has been sealed . Yes , my lord . Jar Jar : Ani ? Ani ! Little Ani ! Vader : Jar Jar , I am no longer Anakin Skywalker . Jar Jar : These are some nice duds . Vader : Look , Jar Jar , it is very important ... that you never speak to me again .

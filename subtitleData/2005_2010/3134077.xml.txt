 He 's due at midnight . He 's usually ponctual . You really need all these ? I 'm not sure how strong he is . - He 's stronger than you ? - Yes . Strength isn 't usually a variable . - Sorry ? - In cases like this . You don 't get extra muscles or anything . There aren 't any cases like this . Please . The woman sitting opposite you is Katherine Reimer . She 's a psychiatric nurse , with experience in ... related areas . She 's fully apprised of the situation and yes , she can be trusted . If you approve , she 's coming to work for us . For both of us . She won 't take sides . Please , consider it . We can 't go on the way we 've been going . In the event she decides to release you from the chair , the cameras are on . You know the rules . If you do release him , there are three things he 'll never leave the appartment without . Digital recorder , runs for twenty-four hours . Kept on at all times , unless by prior agreement . GPS , keeps a track of his movements . Afterwards , you download everything on the computer . There 's time-code on both so you can corrolate . You wear those things too ? - Yes . - Mutual surveillance . Exactly . And the third thing ? The dictaphone . It 's how we communicate . What , like " we 're running low on milk " , that kind of thing ? Sometimes . What 's wrong ? He 's coming . You said " violent episodes " . Yes . What if he has one ? There 's not a lot you can do about it , is there ? - Under the circumstances . - Please . Could you just sit over there ? What if he hurts someone ? If he 's as bad as you say ... - He is . - What if he kills someone ? - He won 't . - Why not ? Because I 'd turn myself in . There 're rules for you too ? He says if I ever attempt to look for a cure , he 'll put a bullet in his brain . I see . He doesn 't know the key code , you 'll need to memorize it . I just did . Anything else I should tell you ? Do you ever smile ? Let me know . Good luck , Ms Reimer . Good night , Dr Jackman . 6 p.m. I 'll be offline for three hours . I will not be changing location . - Daddy ! - Hi ! How are you ? - What have you been up to ? - Can you carry us ? You two ? What have they been to ? Huge enormous fat men ! What are you eating ? Right , you two , out to the garden . I have to talk to Mummy . See you in a minute . You might at least have had the decency to be having an affair . It 's one thing coming second best to another woman ... But coming second best to no woman at all ... You 're being positively thoughtless . How long has this been going on ? That was so gonna be my question ! I can 't believe you actually put a private detective on me . And I can 't believe you actually left your wife and kids without an explanation . I win . So , I take it this explains the black van that seems to be following me everywhere ? Actually , we never discussed the colour of the van . In a minute ! I don 't ... I don 't have a secret lover or anything . - " Secret lover " . - Well , I don 't ! Darling , you 're too repressed to have a secret lover . Was I always repressed ? Even at the beginning ? When I had the twins , d 'you know what my first thought was ? The first thougts through my head ? What ? " I think he likes me . " Eddie ! I thought I told you to- - Eddie , I mean it ! Good night , Eddie . Night , Harry . I should go . Is that what you should do ? Tom ... Claire ... I can 't . Whatever the problem is ... Whatever it is that 's keeping you from us ... Whatever 's happened that 's so bad you think you can 't talk to me about it ... Sorry . - What 's wrong ? - I have to go . Not here . No . Dr Jackman ? Unscheduled change , he 's coming . What brought it on this time ? It 's happening more and mode . No time ! You look ... different . How much do I owe you ? Just once . Seriously , just bloody once , could you tell me where you parked ? Good evening . I don 't drink whiskey . It 's not for you . I wasn 't sure who to expect . He didn 't stay long . Couple of hours , between 8 and 10 . I 'll tell him he owes you . Unless you want the time now . Thursday evening . I 've got a meeting out of town . Fine . Where did you come around ? The usual . - Did you pay her ? - Yes . Prostitutes take their money upfront . You paid her twice . No reason for you boys to pay double when you 've only got the one ... Well , you know . Thank you , Katherine . If you changed in the car , you probably hid it in the glove box . Want me to go and look ? Don 't you think he 's entitled to know he 's married ? I should give you the safe combination . No need . Sometimes , you 're actually quite frightening . Much coming from you ... What triggered it this time ? The unscheduled visit ? It 's happening more and more . D 'you think it 's stress-related ? - I don 't know . - We should start making notes . If you like . Any messages ? - Anything from him ? - He wants a name . - Where did that come from ? - Not having a name , I imagine . Ok , tell him he can choose one . - He wasn 't asking your permission . - Tell him he has it . And your books arriver . Only two titles they couldn 't find . I 've tracked them down , they 'll be here tomorrow . Thank you . That 's a lot of reading . Must be a very long article you 're writing . It is , yes . Are you looking for a cure , Dr Jackman ? Which , obviously , I completely understand . But I work for both of you , and that 's not in the terms of your agreement . I don 't mind turning a blind eye , you 're entitled to research your condition . But then he 's entitled to know that he 's married , isn 't he ? He 's not married . I 'm married . Good night , Katherine . Good night , Dr Jackman . - Where do you want access to ? - Just the library . Not the coffee shop ? That will be nice . Thanks . We miss you around here , Dr Jackman . Writing another article ? Well , you know . Keeping the wolf from the door ? Always . You don 't do crosswords . How do you know ? They 're for fun . Good Lord , really ? If you want to talk to me , you don 't have to lurk about my general vicinity , - just try phoning . - Oh , for God 's sake . Six months . Your wife and your job . If you 're having a nervous breakdown in some little waitress ' service flat , you must have got it out of your system by now . Peter , advertise my job . How can you bear it ? Writing about what you used to do . How can that be enough for you ? Very certain you used to have some sort of an ego . I did . It got so big it left me . Actually , that 's quite funny . You have no idea . Hang on , hang on ! Could we at least go for a drink ? Sorry , I 've got someone coming . Ok , a quick half , then ! I 've gotta go home and change . Are you looking at the time ? I 'm heading back now . He 's due at 7 . This is a schedule change , he 's never late for those . I know . I found that detective agency for you . They 've got an office at 19 Bowman Road . Bowman Road ? Yeah . That 's just ten minutes away . Dr Jackman , you don 't have time . No , of course not . Come on ... - Excuse me , I 'm looking for ... - Through there . - You ok ? - What do you think , sweetie ? No , they were cancelled . No , I 'm serious , all of them . Breaks my heart too , itsy-bitsy pieces . Listen , I 've got to go . No , really , I 'm going . Kiss your dogs for me . Bye bye ! Obviously , you know who I am . Good evening , Dr Jackman . You might want to think again about the black van , it 's hard to miss . Probably the tainted windows . I 'm not coming through to take notes . You never did . Well , that goes double now . How ? Exactly . Why didn 't you show my wife all of the photographs ? I know there must be others . There 's someone missing . A friend of mine . If you 've been following me all this time , you 'd have seen him , there must be photographs . Well ? He 's a pretty boy . All the more reason to have shown the photographs to my wife . Dr Jackman . At this moment , do you know what the single most important fact of your life is ? I thought I did . Have you got five minutes ? Yes ... Don 't go anywhere . Apparently I smoke . When did he start ? Where are you ? I can change in the car . Are you in the car now ? Stick a patch on his arm . Remind him we don 't have a lung each . Are you in the car now ? I 'll call you back . - Where does she go ? - Home . - For the night ? - For good , we 're closing down . I 'm sorry ? You 're sorry ? You 're Dr Jackman , aren 't you ? Yes . So , what 's so special about you ? Special ? Someone paid her a lot of money and you 're the only one she was following . You said you were coming back . I told you to stay where you were . Would you mind telling me what the hell you 're doing ? Getting away from you as far as I possibly can . So I see . Dr Jackman , the single most important fac in your life ... Is what ? I don 't own a black van . What do you think you 're doing ? Are you listening to me ? - I 'm sorry . - Get up ! Get up ! - I have to go . - Yeah ? Might be not , eh ? - Billy , don 't , leave him ! - Shut up ! What I 'm reaching for is not a weapon . - What 're you doing ? - You see ? Just a tape recorder . He 's got a knife . Minimum necessary force , you understand me ? - I will check . - What 're you doing ? Saving your life , I hope . Turn around ! - Face the wall ! - Why ? Because I told you to . Was he attacking you ? What 's it to you ? Just trying to salve my conscience . While I still have one . You stay there . Don 't move . He 's got a knife . Minimum necessary force , you understand me ? I will check . What was that about ? You look ... First fag of the day , always hits the spot . You stay away from me . - I 'll hurt you ! - Yeah ? You think ? Don 't worry . I have a good doctor . Jesus ! It 'll hurt more tomorow . Which works for me . Now ... You know what I call this , children ? The perfect start to an evening . The night is young , there 's a beautiful girl , and somebody 's going to die . It 's you , by the way . What ? Minimum necessary force . Let 's see . What do you say I give you three goes ? - " Goes " ? - With the knife . I just stand here , and you give it your best shot three times . afterwards , once you 're done , I 'll break your neck . - You what ? - Trust me , the neck 's good . Quick for you , easy for me , everybody 's happy ! - Billy , just go ! - That 's an option . I 'd consider that . Because quite honestly ... I 'm only in this to do your girlfriend . That was one . Billy , just leave ! I think she wants to be alone with me . One more go . Make it a good one . Billy , please ! That 's a good name . I might use that name when you 're finished with it . Which is going to be any second now . Let 's make it easy . Take a spot . Relax . Take your time . You 've got the rest your life . Oh , well , Billy , thanks for competing , you 've been a hit ! But it 's time to say good night to the folks at home ! Are you ready , Billy ? Here comes God ! Don 't kill him ! The truth is ... Are you listening , Billy ? The truth is , if I 'm being honest , if I 'm not winding you up , I don 't get a lot of pleasure out of killing children . But I get enough . Ok , lions . Do you know anything about lions ? - Lions ? - Do you what happens when the head lion gets killed by one of the young ones ? You know what the lionesses do ? They go straight into heat for the new head of the family . It 's like hubby 's dead on the grass , all the cubs have been slaughtered and suddenly everybody 's singing " Can you feel the love tonight " . D 'you wanna play lions ? Let me go ! Come on , let 's play lions ! Don 't run . Not when we 're playing lions . You know what runs ? Food runs . Let me go ! C-c-c-catch you later ! Mark this , Billy , I have a nice side . But you just missed him . Billy ! What do you think ? Could I be a Billy ? Go on . You were here before , weren 't you ? Yes ! Yeah , well I 'm surprised you can remember it . My liver applied for a transplant . This time , let 's not give him the chance . What do you want ? What 's really bad for hangovers ? Your friend left . Wait , hang on . Look at you , Mr Safe Sex , I 'm impressed ! Shit ! You 've numbered them . - Why ? - It 's an arrangement . - Who with ? - Doesn 't matter . I 'll tell you what matters , I don 't even know your name . Funny you should say that . Mr Hyde ? Mr Hyde , are you in there ? - Is that you ? - No . Mr Hyde , I saw you go in there . Who the hell is Mr Hyde ? - You are . - Says who ? I hope I didn 't catch you in the middle of someone . I got you a drink . I 'm Benjamin . Benjamin Lennox . Call me Ben . Call me whatever you like . Mr Hyde ... ? You don 't know that 's your name ? Come on ! Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde . You 've read that ! You 're wondering what the hell I 'm taking about . I 'm wondering about that wee window up there , and if you 'd fit through it at speed . This is Christopher . In the event of ... you attempting any violence on my person , Mr Hyde , Christopher is gonna take an attitude . And believe me when I tell you you don 't wanna be there when Christopher takes an attitude . You know what ? Don 't throw me out the window , Mr Hyde . What do you want ? - Tell you who you are . - Who says I want to know ? - I do . - Who are you ? Forgive me , Mr Hyde , I mean this in a corporate rather than an individual sense , but in point of fact I 'm your owner . Now , there 's two things we can do here . I can tell you what the hell I 'm taking about , or you can try throwing Christopher out that little bit of window . I don 't think Christopher will fit . Cheers . Cheers ! - Don 't be an idiot ! - What the hell is going on ? What time of night do you call this ? Dr Jackman keeps apologizing for his bad temper . He doesn 't realize he 's permanently on four-hours sleep and a hangover . You should give up on him . I 'm sorry ? He 'd never have hired you if he 'd wanted you . You know why ? Never had a reason to think about it . If Jackman gets a hard-on ... I 'm it . That 's interesting . Because I 've always thought of you as a bit like a hard-on . Oh , yeah ? Usually disappointing . Drink all of it . If you wouldn 't mind , thanks . I 've still got that headache . Should I be seeing a doctor ? Damn it . Oh , great . Thank you . That detective agency , Callendar 's . Closed down , forwarding address is just a mailbox . " The Lion King and other Disney favourites " . That 's his . I should put it away . He has Disney favourites ? He likes the songs . My dark side likes Mary Poppins . - No wonder I was bullied at school . - You said it yourself , he 's a child . Need you to find out where that mailbox is . Bedfordshire . Exactly , physically where . Hello , sweetie . This is the part where you 're supposed to follow me . It would help if you were awake . I 'm in that tangerine car , over there . Put your engine on , try to keep up . If you 're careful , I bet I shan 't suspect a thing . Found him ! Right , although technically he was supposed to be find us . At first , I thought it was some kind of make-up job , but ... See , the hairline is clearly different . And also , he seems at least two inches than you . A little narrower accross the shoulders . You missed out sexier . He 's a sexy boy , yeah . And if Miranda and I notice he 's sexy , he really must be pushing the envelope . Isn 't that so , dear ? Oh , look , I think Dr Jackman is making a clever deduction about is . So , tell us about ... yourselves . Why ? Because someone paid me a very large amount of money to stop following you . Which we took , of course . I didn 't care to see what came next in their repertoire of persuasion . And also , we need a new kitchen . And there 's the baby , of course . Oh , and the baby , yeah , of course . We 're pregnant . Well , mostly me . So , any idea who might be bribing us , Dr Jackman ? Or who might be following you in the black van ? - Don 't you wanna find out ? - Of course I do ! Then let us help you . - I don 't need any help . - I think you do . I can handle this on my own . I entirely believe you , but then again , you never are , aren 't you ? On your own . It started about six months ago . I 'd had symptoms before , for years , but nothing really major . Hair on my forearms I was no aware of , things like that . Then I started having blackouts . Except of course , they weren 't blackouts . I thought maybe it was a split personality thing , but there was an actual physical change . For a while I thought I was cursed , or a werewolf , or God knows what . And what do you think now ? My condition is unprecedented . Nothing like this has ever happened before . Yes , it has . Jekyll and Hyde . Yes , the comparison has occured to me , but this is fiction . Step into my office . Dr Henry Jekyll , 1883 , Edimburgh . Amongst his close friends , one Robert Louis Stevenson . Jekyll died a few months before Stevenson 's story was published . It was a true story ? At least , based on truth . He looks like me . Exactly like you , yeah . You said he died ? At the age of 43 , not long after this photograph was taken . About my age , then . I think time is becoming a factor . What did he die of ? It 's unclear , even in the story , but he died as Hyde . But my case is different , isn 't it ? He drank a potion or something . In the story he was drugged , that 's how he changed . I never took anything . Maybe you just inherited it . Like it 's in your blood now , runs in the family . Well , it would make sense , juste one problem ... Dr Jekyll and Dr Jackman are not related . Look at them , they must be . - But they 're not , they can 't be . - Why not ? It 's interesting that you have twins . Do they have similar personalities or are they opposites ? They 're very sweet , Dr Jackman . Don 't you worry about them ? What with your , you know funny times ? I know Dr Jackman has given a great deal of thought to their protection . Of course you have . But then I wonder how much protection would ever be enough . So , why can 't Dr Jackman and Dr Jekyll be related ? Because Dr Jekyll is the last of the Jekyll line . There were no brothers and sisters , no surviving cousins , nobody . That 's impossible . You 're a foundling , aren 't you , Dr Jackman ? Left in a railway station in Belfast , raised by foster parents , nobody really knows how you got here . I know you 've tried to find out , so have I , but ... There 's nothing out there . Not a footprint , not a kiss . You arrived in this world without a trace . Dr Jekyll , 1883 ... Dr Jackman , today . I think we need to find out how you got here . Where do my children live ? Sorry ? My family , my children . Where do they live ? Tell me the address . - You know the address . - I 'd like to visit them . You visit them all the time . I 'd like to visit them now . Min , could you pop to the house and get the other file on Dr Jackman ? I think that 's the one with the address in it . There isn 't another file . Yeah , there is , it 's the top shelf of the sitting room . I 'm sure there isn 't . Min , please , could you just do as you 're told ? It 's not like I 'm your secretary or something ! Dr Jackman ... I think you assume that your other half is a manifestation of your dark side . I don 't think you 're right . I think he 's a child . Albeit a child with the body and drives of a fully grown adult . He has extraordinary strength and speed , he has stamina far beyond the normal . And he 's also brand new . How often in this world does the sun rise on something completely new ? And how often do we mistake a miracle for a monster ? I don 't think he 's a monster . Or at least he doesn 't have to be . Do you understand me ? Do you understand me ? You can be anything you want to be ... Mr Hyde . Daddy ! You might at least have told me you were just gonna ... Bloody hell ! What happened to you ? Have you done something ? Have you dyed your hair ? You look ... Oh , my God . I 'm sorry , I 'm so sorry , I thought you were Tom . You look just like him . I 'm guessing your second name is Jackman . I didn 't think Tom had any family . Neither did I. It 's so typical . Tom never even mentioned he had a cousin . You know what he 's like . Shall we go through ? There 's cake . Bring a knife . What a perfect start to the evening . Well ? I spoke to Hyde . It didn 't get anywhere much . Hyde is an animal . He wouldn 't . What next ? Got a few thoughts kicking around . When can we bring him in ? How soon ? We can 't just pull him off the streets . This is England . It 's like the Third World , with rights . Tom Jackman won 't have rights for long . That 's a nice thought , Ms Adison , but I don 't see ... He can 't control Hyde , not forever . Eventually , Hyde will do something . Something that Jackman cannot forgive . Eventually , he will know that he cannot contain him . And then we begin . Daddy ! - Harry ! - And Eddie ! Eddie ! Hello , boys . How are you ? You surprised me . Nice to see you . Nice to see you . Oh , boys , boys ! I didn 't hear the car . You alright ? Is Billy still here ? Billy ? Your cousin Billy . My cousin ? Said you knew he was coming around . Is he still here ? No , no , he 's gone . He had the kids up playing half the night . The whole house looks like a bomb hit it . I 've put some coffe on . Come on ! And you . Serious charmer , by the way . You ought to watch it . Wish I could see your face , Daddy . Got you that time , didn 't I ? But seriously , Daddy , be sensible . What makes you think I would ever hurt my family ? And here 's something interesting . I found out my name ! Someone told me my name . Isn 't that good , Daddy ? My name is Jackman . Of course , your name is Jackman too . But I 'm starting to think you 're not gonna be around much longer . Time 's up , old man . Time to move over and let the next guy have a go . World 's changing , gotta change with it . Love your wife , by the way . D 'you know about lions , Daddy ? D 'you know what lionesses do when there 's a new head of the family ? Good night ... Dr Jackman . Dr Jackman , is that you ? Dr Jackman , please , say that 's you . It 's me . Are your family ok ? Listen , we couldn 't stop him . He locked us in the cellar , he said he wanted to see his family . Are they ok ? They 're not his family . They 're not his family ! Dr Jackman , are you alright ? They 're not your family ! Are you alright ? I 'll be down in a minute , it 's alright . What 's wrong ? Nothing , I 'm alright . Be down in a minute . Listen to me . We 've had an agreement . A truce . And it has worked . We have survived . But understand me . There 's a line I will not allow you to cross . If you ever come here again ... If you set foot near my family again ... No agreement , no truce . It 's war . Do you understand me ? Come to my family again , and you and I are at war .

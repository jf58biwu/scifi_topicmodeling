Princess ? I feel some sort of vital spirit stirring there . is it not ? { sz : sounds like she 's doing political visits or something } so it must be under construction at the moment . Hey ! Hey ! { chi sound } What ? ! Where 's he aiming from ? How should I know ? This happened because you 're a stupid-head ! Shit ! Huh ? He 's gone ! Shut up ! What 's done is done ! Just figure out where he is A.S.A.P ! You 're being too loud for me to hear ! There ! let 's go ! You go get killed and good riddance ! I 've got you now ! where is he ? I don 't know ! that 's all . you little — What a coincidence ! I was just thinking of how I was in the mood to eat a stupid-head ! To your right ! What is ? a ball ! What ? From where ? your right ! Which one is my right ? This hand ! { alt tl : This one ! } Damn ! He really is a rock head . Nice of him to be the bait and all ... From this position I can see everything with ease . He 's there ! You 're mine ! Th-That 's ... Does he plan to use as many balls as he needs to take us both on ? ! It hurts ... But it 's amazing ! He 's so good he can even trample me ! Amazing ! Amazing ! It 's amazing ! God dammit ! I h-hate this ! but welling up from deep within me ... { I know japs love to refer to themselves as their bodies and shit but whateverz . It 's engrish . } ... is such bliss ... I like it ! no kidding around ! They 're both trashed to bits . Now this is worth fixing ! go ! so go eat ! Eat ! There 's no way I 'm gonna let that bastard slide ! you say ... Well that doesn 't narrow down the list of suspects ... Not just anyone can throw the balls like he threw them . I 'm gonna track him down ! And you ? I don 't know . Pathetic . and still didn 't get a glimpse of a face or two ! { sz : lit he says " one face or two faces " . Dan is maybe not so good at the sentences } As if you got close at all . Sela ? I 'm going home . Take care of the repairs for me . Thanks for the business ! It 'll take a little while . I wonder if that girl 's okay . " Girl " ? What girl ? Legend . I didn 't lose ! Look ! Word has spread already ! " Dunk Mask Reappears ! " The end of a legend and the beginning of something new ?

" F-Fur-Furth ... he was cast deep into adversity when a mysterious long shooter appeared and destroyed his beloved mech . Beloved ? Adversity ? { sz : the JP is sortof high-level kanji words and Dan has clearly no idea what they mean . } " Bigfoot City Basketball is currently in the throes of a multipartite power struggle . { sz : lol this " multipartite power struggle " word is an extremely high-level kanji phrase that is supposed to be confusing . } no matter who they are . signing off . { heeeh sound } That girl earlier — She 's called the Platinum Hurricane ! That 's so cool . What a load of bull . " Debt King " ? What 's with that ? ! " Debt King " ? ! you can 't blame them . after all . What ? ! these City Basketball columns sure get updated fast . I don 't like it ! There 's someone sneaking around spying on me . Dan ? Get even ! I 'm gonna make ' em return the debt a hundredfold ! No — 5.3 billionfold ! That man ... He might be ... my lonely-looking little lady ! and I guess that someone is me . why i went with " any good " which would double as a sexual innuendo joke too ! } and burst into tears five times over ! Waste of my time . You all could bundle your genes in a nice variety pack and I 'd still pass . Honestly . this is lit " All the men I meet are totally weak . " It 's very similar to her " bottom-of-the-barrel men " line from ep1 . The wet paper bag thing is meant to be a reference to the " kitten in a wet paper bag " expression . } { kya ! } Billy ! Are you okay ? ! { these words are hard to hear but are buried in the general " kyaa ! " } Hold on ! It hurts ! Don 't die ! then girls will be girls . I won 't let anyone walk over me and get away with it . But ... What I want is ... Are you all right ? A beautiful woman with a seductive look — that 's just asking for trouble . Iceman ? I 'm surprised you know of me . you blocked him ... that was a painful day . By that point it wasn 't even a real match anymore . You should go home . Won 't be long before the moonlight fades . Moon moon . MBS . { Broadcast since later down it says Broadcast . Consistency } This ends tonight 's broadcast . MBS . shall I escort you ? I 'd be glad to offer my counseling services on the way . I suppose so . I might have to ask you all sorts of questions . I can 't stop wondering who and where the man is who made me feel this way ! Do you play streetball ? sadly . It seems you may have mistaken me for someone else . Iceman Hottie . I only fight when I play Bigfoot Basketball . Iceman . Would you consider giving me your genes ? Once would be enough . You 're an interesting young woman . I 'm Sela . Sela Miranda . Sela . He actually made me blush . Incredible ... which occurred last year when this was still a Bigfoot Basketball arena . It was Dunk Mask who destroyed the match and also destroyed the arena . that it lead them to them to cherish their own hopes and dreams and became an awe-inspiring legend that is still passed down today ! you say ? ! How barbaric ! the things which these vulgar savages contrive are — endeavors such as these by the common people { ' jiiya ' – ê ‚ â appears more like an abbreviation of a title or a nickname than a real name — the " jii " is the kanji for " old man " — but it 's not any family relationship term and I have no idea how to translate it if it 's a nickname . So romaji it is . } are what support the lifestyle which we enjoy at the royal palace . Do not be rude . Princess . But you know ? Isn 't it a bit weird to say it 's " still passed down today " when it 's only been a year ? I don 't care . we got your Dunk Mask shirts and Dunk Mask towels right here ! be careful ! Destroy ! huh ? you think maybe this is a declaration of war ? What is this ? Anti-Establishment terrorism ? ! everyone . The aura of anger has already vanished . Destroy ! Destroy ! Coco ! Coco ! Destroy is targeting you ! you 'll die ! come with your brother now and let 's get out of here ! Coco ! Coco ! run ! but just do it ! and you run south ! Okay ? ! But just get out of here ! Coco ! Coco ! Coco ! What are you wailing about ? Wake up ! just take a better look at it ! It 's your stupid head . Dan . What ? ! Those too . this is amazing ! I 've never seen such a mountain of trashed mechs before . guys ! You all had better take some time to recuperate too . sir . there 's this too . What the hell ? ! that bastard ! I have a Bigfoot that needs some repairs — another one ? ! I fix them and I fix them and yet there 's still more ! Dan ! Do something about this ! do something " ? Get rid of that Destroy guy . No need to strain yourself asking me . I 'm gonna get even with him myself . Then hurry up about it ! That 's what I 'm figuring out now ! there 's no way to know what direction he 'll be attacking from ! So I ... In that case figure it out faster ! I 'm trying ! That 's right ! He 's a pea-brain so it takes time ! Yeah ! people who don 't operate Bigfoots might start getting hurt too . Brother ! Coco ... I 'm willing to join forces to get rid of him . it 's the Platitude Hotpad . Platinum Hurricane ! It might be someone you know . I don 't know anyone that vicious . We can 't afford to wait until Dan thinks of something . We just have to get rid of him . But it 's hard to do that when you don 't know when or from what direction he 'll attack . you 'd get taken out instantly ... huh ? right ? what are you eating ? ashamed to be eating just a mouse and not someone 's ankle or something . } you 're the most vicious . That 's it ! What is ? We just have to lure him to us ! How ? Fire safety ! Dunk Mask says only you can prevent fires ! not funny . } How should I know ? that 's for sure ! Dunk Mask is fire safety ! Dunk Mask ! He dunks in a mask and is careful with matches ! Destroy ! destroy ! Destroy ! Fire safety ! Dunk Mask is here ! What ? ! Destroy ! This is ... Fire safety ! Iceman Hottie . Destroy ! I thought you said you didn 't play streetball . This isn 't basketball . It 's Destroy ! What ? ! You hog the ball too much ! I see . He is someone I know . Perfect . and I 'm gonna pay it back ten billionfold ! But I think just one ball is enough . Let 's go . Three ... Two ... One ... Zero ! Why you ! You aren 't getting away ! My head ! what did I tell you ? those two ... Princess . Mixed with the wind is the same aura that I felt then ... No ... One more wild . That is most likely the effect of the vulgar inhabitants overflowing this city — Princess ! Princess ! That is dangerous ! Please stop ! Princess ! What is that ? A ball ? A basket ? He hasn 't trained . Someone like that wasted our match and gets treated like a legend ? ! What bullshit ! I won 't allow it ! I 'll take his streetball and destroy it ! Gotcha ! then ? I merely intend to crush all streetball players . young lady ! Sounds promising . Try it then if you can . I 'll turn the tables and grind you in my hand . I 'll have your genes ! What the hell are you talking about ? ! Don 't think you can ignore me ! it 's loud out here . What 's exploding anyway ? what 's the deal ? It 's no use . I really drank too much . That way ! Later we 'll put this on the Net and make a hefty mint . why don 't those three punch or kick or anything ? wouldn 't that way be faster ? Sometimes you come up with some radical ideas ! But it 's because those three are basketball players . It 's their style to do it that way . I guess that could work out ... Whoa ! Destiny ... There 's destiny in the wind . destroy ! { connect to scene if this looks ugly } Purapura ! I told you it 's Platinum ! Just a sec ! Don 't get too full of yourself ! You bastard ! Destroy ! Crap ! Dan ! It 's the cops ! Time to split ! Hurry ! ... Des ... troy ... It 's over . Those people were amazing ! please ! he comes back the worse for wear . good .

I 'm going to be your producer . a woman from the moon . { No official last name spelling that I 've seen } Count your blessings . Dan . Y-Yeah ... There 's no doubt . Those are real . so we could use Lunar or whatever . Elsewhere I was using " moonside " for the same word ( contrast to " groundside / earthside " ) but Lunar seemed better here . } What is a Lunar bust anyway ? ! Means you were beat at your own game and have nothing to stand on now . She wants to book matches for Dan and the others ? ! They 're not a bunch that will listen to her because of her bust !

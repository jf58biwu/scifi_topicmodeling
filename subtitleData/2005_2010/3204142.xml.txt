 In the future , my son will lead mankind in a war against skynet ... A computer system programmed to destroy the world . It has sent machines back through time ... Some to kill him , one to protect him . Today we fight to stop skynet from ever being created , to change our future , to change his fate . The war to save mankind begins now . Previously , on terminator : The Sarah Connor chronicles ... Mr. Ferguson is ill today . My name is cromartie . Do we have a John Reese ? Excellent . You changed the future . You just didn 't change it enough . These things , they are here . And they are programmed with specific missions . It took his eyes , james . Jumper , outside the gym ! It 's my new friend- - crying one from the bathroom . - We gotta help her , now ! - No . I could have done something . I was right there . And what were you gonna do- - be a hero ? Isn 't that what I 'm supposed to be ? A hero ? Isn 't that who I am ? Patient is female , 33 . Previous lipo and breast augmentation with complications of seroma and scarring . Hello ? Hello ? When John was little , before bed , i used to read him fairy tales . One night , I read him a folk tale called the golem of prague , the story of a clay monster made by a rabbi to protect the jews of the city . You shouldn 't be back here . The office is closed . You do reconstructive surgery ? You need a consult . You 'll have to call monday . I need reconstructive surgery . Look , you can either just leave now or I can call the police . Your choice . What I failed to remember was that , at the end of the story , the golem turns on it 's maker and kills him , as well as the rest of the town . Now . He didn 't sleep for months . I went to him and tried to tell him that it wasn 't real , that I 'd made it all up . Somehow , that made it all worse . In memory of jordon cowan 1992 ~ 2007 I 'm sorry up a little late ? " Covalent and ionic bonding . " No wonder you 're still up . I can never get my head around thieither . It 's not that hard . So you wanna talk about it ? Talk about what ? You just seem down . Downer than usual . I 'm fine . John , I know what fine means . Fine means you 're upset about something , and you won 't talk to me . Fine means I 'm fine . I saw there 's a memorial service at school this week for that girl . Jordan . Jordan , right . Are you planning on going ? I try not to make plans . Plans are for people in control of their own lives . I don 't want you to blame yourself for what happened . Who said I blame myself ? What do you want ? Cromartie 's here . Now . What ? I 've been monitoring the media for possible threats . Yesterday , arson at an oakland dock forced the rerouting of a shipment of refined coltan into the port of los angeles . Coltan ? Skynet will use it as a key element in our endoskeletal alloy . That doesn 't mean cromartie 's back . How can it be cromartie ? Are you forgetting that I blew his head off ? I remember . That 's why I went to find this . You should watch . It won 't play . Put it on video 2 . Property of kzpz thank you for explaining . Where 'd you get this ? Check the paper tomorrow for any dead anchormen . I don 't sleep . There . He came through . He knows we 're here . It 's just a head . His chip is intact . We 're programmed to repair ourselves . We 're programmed to blend in . He might still need coltan for a missing piece . A leg , an arm . He will rebuild and continue his mission to hunt and kill . I know what his mission is . I still have the money from the safe house . We can go south , set up across the border , off the grid . Go south . What ? Thought you said we weren 't gonna run anymore . Were were gonna fight . Well , this is different , John . Yeah , you 're right , this is different . If cromartie 's damaged , he 's vulnerable . We know where he 'll be . If he got new skin , he 'll have a new face . We won 't know what he looks like . But we know where he 'll be . I can hack the port schedule , no problem . We find the container and we wait . We hunt him for a change . Or we could run ... Again . The ship comes tonight ? The one carrying the coltan ? 5 : 00 A. M. Like you 're gonna drive . Get the shotguns . It 's not like I can 't drive . And the c-4 from the bathroom under the towels . Cromartie ? Not here yet . Humans . Keep setting the charges . If he comes for that container , he 'll have to come through here . Is that cromartie ? Cameron . He 'll survive . He 's human . Not a very strong one . Mom . Those other guys just stole the truck . Does cmartie have men working with him ? Does that happen ? You work with me . We have to follow that truck . That 's coltan . If that 's what you 're made of , no wonder you 're so dense . Not density . Heat resistance . Two 600 models had a titanium alloy endoskeleton . But it was vulnerable to heat . Coltan alloys have a much higher melting point . You know what I love about you guys ? Even when you 've evolved into the ultimate indestructible killing machine , you 're not above self-examination and improvement . Thank you . Please shut up . Military tags ? Leave it . We need to move . Now . How about we get paid now ? Seriously . How about you shut up and go now , huh ? He 's not damaged at all . That 's not cromartie . Endoskeletal structure points don 't match . He 's too short . Another one ? Why does he have all this ? I thought these things just hunt and killed people . They perform whatever mission they 're programmed for . And what kind of mission is this ? Man , it weirds me out more and more . We barely get a crime scene up , and the fbi is here like that . Like you guys got some kind of magic powers or something . Thanks , lou . Computers , my friend . Log in a weird blood sample that matches one of my other cases , and , poof , I appear . Yeah , well , they 're gonna put us all out of work one of these days ... Not that I 'll mind . Wouldn 't worry about that . Always gonna need somebody to clean up . So who we got here ? Dr. David lyman , plastic surgeon . D him this morning when she came to open up . Swabbed your weird blood out of the drain . Otherwise , the place is clean . Nothing missing , no motive , zip . So what 's your interest here ? I got six guys dead , no rhyme or reason . Except some kind of blood that isn 't quite blood . It 's not natural . I like natural . Natural 's reassuring . It helps me sleep at night . I meant more the fbi 's interest . Well ... You know the fbi . We 're interested in everything . So this guy ... Comes in friday night . Leaves sunday , a . M. That 's the only lead we have at the moment . I thought he looked familiar . He was a patient . We did his chin and nose last may . George lazlo . We still have the charges . We can rig ' em at the door . And blow ' em when they try to drive out . Then cameron can take out- - get in the car . We 're going . What ? John , the plan was to hunt cromartie . - That 's not cromartie . - So ? So you just wanna walk in there and kick their asses and go for pancakes ? It doesn 't work like that . - We 're outnumbered . - We have her . We don 't know what 's going on . That thing has real estated his employees . Who knows how many more are in there . There 's three of us . I 'm not saying we run . But we need to step back , see what 's going on . So we run , in other words . Can you tell him to get in the car ? It 's too dangerous . - We should go . - It 's always too dangerous ! It 's war . War is dangerous ! If you die ... They win . How many of those things , those endoskeletons , do you think they can make out of that load of metal in there ? 'Cause that 's what we 're talking about . It 's a truck full of enemy soldiers . What if they 're building them right here , right now ? If I could get myself on into the truck , we can track them by laptop . John conner , we 're going ... Now . What ? Endoskeletons . Based on the approximate volume of coltan in this shipment . That 's how many . John ! - Damn it , John ! - No ! If they seus , they 'll find him . Here 's the route we 're taking . You wanna tell me what you 're doing here ? Have you seen a dachshund puppy ? They had army uniforms . The tags . Where would they go ? They 're going north . John 's phone . You can track it online . This actually works ? Wait , wait , wait . No , no . The signal is lost . - The phone might be damaged . - Come on . Oh , damn it ! Come on ! Breaking the computer won 't help . Do you have any idea what 's going on ? I lost him . I lost John . I understand . It 's impossible for you to understand . Without John , your life has no purpose . I can 't believe I let him talk me into this . You try to open your hands just a little , and it 's too soon . Is it ? The world ends in four years . What ? Left you a message . Davidson was buying at houston 's . When you didn 't show , they sent me to check to see if you 'd died or something . Did you die ? You run across him on those pico murders ? Or John doe 's bar code tats ? No--who is he ? George lazlo . Unemployed actor . Got him on video at the murder scene . Only suspect I got with his file is straight vanilla . Are you trying to impress the boss ? Wow , crank out the sugar ray and call monica lewinksy . It 's 1999 again . Sugar what ? James ... You trying to get back on the rising young star list ? Forget about it . I mean , this case is a dog . And you 're not young . Agent stewart , can I help you ? You got some guy holed up in room three ? That would be my dog . Lazlo ? He asked if he needed a lawyer . I told him it was just a courtesy thing . So what 's this all about ? It 's about my case . Good case ? We 'll find out soon enough . He strike you as a killer ? Everyone strikes me as a killer . So ... George ... You 're an actor . Been in anything I have seen ? What is this about ? Just some questions related to dr . Lyman 's death . So ... Anything ? I see a lot of movies . It 's been slow . Well , it 's picking up around here , I 'll tell you that . I got six dead bodies and a mystery man who might be trying to change his identity . So is that why you got the work ? Chin and nose . Did you kill the doctor to cover your tracks ? Ah , dolores . Meet mr . Lazlo . I was hopi that he would give us a little blood sample . If you 're not my guy , you 're out of my file here in an hour , tops . Make a fist . Great . Just a little sting . Can 't seem to find a vein . You guys are a bunch of fascists , you know that ? - Are you kidding me ? - No . Tell me where they went . Lady , go to hell . Tell me where they went , or I 'm gonna beat you to death . And don 't call me lady . Tell me where they went , damn it ! You beat him to death , he can 't tell us anything . I 'm not gonna tell you anything . Okay . Yeah , like you got the stones . You can go . If you can get past her . Mcguire gunnery range ? This place is the size of I . A. County . Where exactly are they ? She 's talking to you . It 's depot 37 . It 's a decommissioned arms depot in the southeast corner . You take the outer loop past all these old , abandoned hangars . It was an air force base back in the cold war that- - look , I don 't know what they 're doing . I was just supposed to guard the warehouse and clean up when they left . The guy just needed some guy that 's all I know . I swear to god . Just drive faster . * * * Your tax dollars at work . What , you need more blood ? What the ... Put me down ! Put me down ! - Did you lock this ? - Yeah . Damn it . Damn it ! Guy must have popped it . He 's been bitchin about his money all week . You think he just split ? You surprised ? Y threatened to bail twice a day . Let 's just finish this and get out of here , man . Who tells carter ? You ... He 's your friend . Friend ? He 's just a guy I met . Six victims . Different parts of the city , different worlds , different lives . What 's the connection ? Greta was saying none . Guys in the house were drug dealers . But there 's some blood matches . And we got george here . George lazlo . And who , exactly , is this guy ? Actually , jim- - james ... Not jim . James . Right , right , apologies . Uh , before you go on , I just want to make sure you 're aware lazlo was cleared . Blood sample came back . Not a match to the plastic surgeon 's office . We got blood ? How 'd we manage that ? I , uh , I finessed the samples . And , yes , I heard it didn 't match . But I have been thinking of another possibility . Whoever killed dr . Lyman was in there for two days . I 'm thinking there 's a chance ... Our killer had himself cut to look like lazlo ... Forced the doctor to operate , then killed him . Wouldn 't there be scars and bruising ? The office has a hyperbaric oxygen system ... Which speeds healing . And he could have used makeup . Actually , I considered this too . I asked the office manager . Apparently they keep detailed records of the anesthesia . According to their log , the levels were unchanged . No one had surgery . No one had anesthesia . There 's a possibility they just didn 't use any . Right , I asked that too . She said a jobike that- - four , five hours under the knife , cutting that deep into the tissue of the face , the nose , the eyes- - you can 't take that kind of pain . It 's impossible . You got some kind of release from this lazlo guy , right , for the blood ? Last thing we need 's a lawsuit . So ... If there isn 't anything else ... Sorry , jim . Facts are facts . Sorry about that . But , you know , if it doesn 't add up , it just doesn 't add up . Doesn 't add up it 's ' cause we don 't have all the numbers yet . James , nobody expects anything from you on this . Your ass is suitably covered . Why you wanna rock the boat ? Last time I had a case where this many things didn 't add up , three people blew themselves up in a bank . Look , I don 't know , greta . I just ... I just feel it . Yeah , well , maybe you should try feeling a little less . 'Cause you 're going blind . You ca- - you can 't just leave me here . You--you ... Come on , hurry up . Would have been faster to kill him . Sometimes , you seem inefficient . I 'm not for you to understand . You said that before . Well , I do things , you know ? Stupid , illogical , inefficient things . Humans--get used to it . I told the guy to just be patient . Looks like he bailed . So he 's gone then ? Yeah , it doesn 't surprise me . He was bitching about the money all week . Then I wanna thank you for your service . This is it ? This is depot 37 ? Did that guy lie to you ? No ... This is it . This is where the factory will be . What factory ? Where I 'll be made . Me and many others . Right there . It 's inside . Coltan is rare in the future . Much of it was destroyed when the bombs went off . He 's stockpiling it for after judgment day . It 's in the bunker , where it 'll be safe . Your gun . Give it to me now . I don 't have a gun . I don 't have anything . I didn 't shoot anyone . - Your boss . - Hey , carter ! Listen to me for a second . Just for a second , all right ? What 's your name ? My name 's John . What the hell are you doing here ? I 'm--I 'm just looking , man . I 'm in the wrong place at the wrong time . All right ? - What 's your name ? - Mike . All right , mike . Listen , we got a problem . Okay ? Your boss , he 's a ... He 's a really bad guy . All right ? He killed those guys . And he 'll kill us if he finds us . So we need to get out- - carter ? He shot them ? Look , you 've worked with this guy , right ? Have you noticed that something 's just off about him ? Like--like he 'd just kill you just because . So there 's somethingng wrong with him . You know ? Yeah . Where is he ? No ... . Don 't ! This bastard owes me my money ! I 'll take my share and theirs too . Freak ! I 'm talkin ' to you ! Look , man , just open the door . Thank you for your service . What are you ? It 's not your fault . Maybe it 's yours . Maybe if you 'd have let him try to save that girl , or at least let him think he had a choice in the matter , maybe he wouldn 't have gone off the reservation . John does these things . Not the John I know . The John I know . - Hello ? - Mom John , thank god . We 're right outside . - You all right ? - Yeah . Listen , he 's blocking the door . It 's--it 's like he 's frozen . He 's frozen ? Yeah , when the door shut , it 's like he went to sleep or something . Standby . He completed his mission . He powered down to standby mode until he 's moved or triggered awake . Triggered ? The door . They put him into standby . 15 Seconds . That 's the reboot time . John , listen to me . This is what I want you to do . I want you to open that door . And run . The instant that door cracks open , you run . John yeah , I run . So what do you think future John would do right now ? We 'll see . John . Come on I thought you said you could drive . It 's jammed or something . Step on the clutch . Hard ! If you 're gonna be a hero , you gotta learn how to drive a stick . Let 's go . But can he get out ? Drive . Mr. Lazlo . May I come in ? Thank you . Pepperoni ? I love those things . My bosses told me I should stay clear of you . For legal reasons . I understand . But I thought I owed it to you to drop by . Give you a warning . A warning ? Well , there 's a chance- - a small chance , but a chance- - that there 's someone out there who might be trying to steal your identity . Steal my identity ? What would they do with that ? What do people do with anything these days ? Steal , cheat , harm , and intimidate others . Damage the national psyche . Anyway ... If you see or hear anything unusual , call me , anytime . Thank you for your help . Sure . Have a nice day . Have a nice day . Not every version of the golem story ends badly . In one , the monster is a hero , destroying all those that seek to harm it 's maker . In another , the golem 's maker destroys his creature before it destroys the world . You okay ? I 'm fine . Really . How many times we gonna have this talk ? A lot , I think . I should go finish my homework . The pride of man , of parents as well , makes we can control . Whether from clay or from metal , it is in the nature of us to make our own monsters . Our children are alloys , all , built from our own imperfect flesh . We animate them with magic . And never truly know what they will do .

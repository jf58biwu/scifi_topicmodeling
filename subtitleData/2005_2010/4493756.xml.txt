 # to all the people underground # # listening to the sound # # of the living people # # walking up and down ... # Glad I got that second chair . Don 't get a lot of visitors out here . Makes what friends I have left Feel bad to see me this way , I guess . I don 't have a lot to tell them . Still broke . Still love a woman . Still can 't have her . I wonder what she 'd say if she saw me this way . I bet she 'd love me anyway . Don 't take that bet . I know she 'd love me anyway . She 's programmed to . Now , some might say that takes the magic out of love , To know you are loved . But what 's still a surprise Is how much you Love her . I loved her to abstraction . To destitution . I blew my fortune on engagements . Now , only my love sustains me . Love for a woman who doesn 't exist . That 's my sad story . You want to know the saddest part ? It 's the ending . Seems like maybe love wasn 't enough . Dollhouse s02e08 Love Supreme Are you having one of your headaches , my dear ? I 'm not my best . Well , we 'll have to do something about that . Tell me , how long have you been having these headaches ? I don 't know . Well , let 's be mathematical . Did they begin before Your three-month absence from the dollhouse ? I ... I don 't know . Do you remember being away from here ? It wasn 't nice . Does a treatment sound nice ? Hmm , I can see that it does . Do you have something you want to tell me Before we schedule you for that treatment ? No . You choose pain . I wish she 'd say something about her absence . Then all this could be over . Are you certain she said nothing to you when you found her ? No . I told you . She barely spoke at all . She was in really bad shape . She still is . Yes . One wonders how she managed . Out there . Alone . The odds of an active in an infantile state Surviving outside the dollhouse , unprotected ... I suppose we must take into account The fact that Echo is special . You 're punishing her for surviving . It 's complete lunacy . You 're wrong , Mr. Ballard . I 'm very sorry for Echo 's suffering , But we must have answers . So if she floats , she 's a witch ? That will be all for today . Thank you , dr . Gholsen . We 'll pick it up tomorrow . Until I 'm satisfied that Echo wasn 't exposed To dangerous elements during her sojourn , These sessions will continue . Will you excuse me , gentlemen ? I 'll consult with my expert . Expert on what ? What does she think she 's going to get out of Echo ? She doesn 't expect to get anything out of Echo . She 's using her to make you squirm , And it 's working . I can 't help it . I don 't like seeing her in pain . I don 't like Seeing her in pain . I looked into her eyes and swore to protect her , same as you . Before you . Today , protecting her means not reacting While de Witt tortures her . So man up . You must have some suspicions . No . I find her in a perfect , childlike state : Simple , accepting and , uh , contradictory . She 's hiding something . I 'm telling you , if she did something naughty , She 's completely unaware of it . She , however , is naughty And completely aware of it . Let 's stay on task , shall we , doctor ? Oh , you don 't like my remark , ms . Dewitt ? You prefer men To keep their natural urges to themselves ? On the contrary , urges are my stock in trade . I find identifying With those of my clients to be very useful . But that 's your sales pitch , I think . In truth , you 're very tightly controlled . See , men wear Everything on the outside , Including their genitalia . Whereas , you are chastised for any suggestion of sexuality . Punished , perhaps . So goes the entirety of intersexual relations Throughout history , dr . Gholsen . I really don 't see ... No wonder you Despise that girl . Echo . She gets to be the virgin And the whore , and for both , she 's , uh , celebrated . Yes , very insightful . Would you like a treatment ? Oh , yeah . Very much so . That was a tiresome exercise . I told you , brain science Is all about hardware and software . There 's no mystical in-between . So tell me . What 's wrong with her ? Why is she getting these headaches ? Weirdly , I agree with dr . Freudenstein . There 's no tumors , nothing physical . It 's all in her mind . So she 's perfectly normal ? Normal as anyone else around here . And I suppose There are some nonsensical scans To back up your report ? Would you like to see them ? These are the craziest scans I 've ever seen . I can 't even look at them without going nuts ! I know a conspiracy when I desperately try to avoid seeing one . Did you tell de Witt ? No . So why don 't you two crack open your little Chamber pot of secrets and tell me what 's going on ? Echo 's not a blank slate . She 's a person . What do you mean ? She 's self-aware ? That 's not all she is . Everything you 've imprinted her with for the last six months , It 's still there . So she 's got five people worth Of brains banging around up there ? More . She 's got everyone Alpha dumped into her , as well . That 's everyone . He took every imprint she 'd ever had . I went in with a q-tip after ! Didn 't work . She hasn 't been wiped for months . The wipes just push everything down , But it all surfaces again . And now , She can control what and when . She can control ... ? What does that make her ? What is she ? Mr. Ballard . Please sit down . I know that the exhaustive Health screenings I 've been running on Echo Seem misguided to you . I know that you 're looking for something That I don 't think you 'll finind . Well ... You see , in the dollhouse , Things aren 't always what they seem . Echo , for instance . Perfectly healthy . That 's good news . Isn 't it ? I 'm putting her back in the field . She is our most requested active . In fact , Mr. Pierce has already booked her For a romantic engagement . So soon ? What about the headaches ? I take your point . Romantic engagements can be a bit strenuous . But ... He 's a repeat client of hers . And " not tonight honey , I have a headache " Really isn 't one of the excuses we allow our actives . I thought you might need this . Well , to Echo 's health . To Echo 's health . Echo ... It 's time for your treatment . We never meet like this anymore . I missed you , too . Is she Still eleanor penn ? Yes . Is she still terry karrens ? Topher , yes . So she 's a serial killer . Only a little . Right , only a little bit serial killer . And we let her outside ? She 's in control , Topher . She 's in control ? Not you ? Not Paul ? And who is " she " again ? Does she still trust you with her life ? And is that because she 's programmed to , Or just because you 're A swell guy with a trustworthy brow ? I like to think both . Oh ! She 's here . You 're all here . Nice to meet you . We 've met , Topher . Don 't you remember ? She 's funny . Is that a good sign ? Um , so we 're going to send you To a Mr. Frank Pierce . I mean , if that 's okay with you ? I do work here . Okay . Well , frank wants susan , Who I guess is his wife ? Whoa ! No , she 's his sister-in-law . Susan , you are a heartbreaker . So , if you could just hop in the chair for me . Am I going to see frank today ? Oh , my gosh ! Oh , my gosh ! I can 't wait . Got her . Repeat engagement . Had her filed away . Shall we go ? I am obsolete . This must be what old people feel like . And blockbuster . Watching you in that cell in pain , I thought about this part . I knew that we 'd come to the end of the torture at some point And we 'd be back out in the field doing our thing . And I thought , " that 's when we 'll run . " And you thought , " that 's stupid . " We 'd end up in the same place , except worse , Because it would be the attic . I don 't like this . I don 't like being your pimp . I don 't like it either . Frank Pierce isn 't so bad . He 's actually kind of sweet in a hapless way . Okay , fine . He 's not really my type . But he 's susan 's . And that 's who I 'll be when I 'm with him . Susan loves Frank Pierce dearly , And cannot wait to be back in his arms . And tell him what a horrible mistake I made marrying his brother . He 'll never make me happy . I 'm finally going to leave him . You 're doing the right thing . Yeah . Frank ? Frank ? You old softie . How many roses lost Their lives for this ? Oh , my gosh . Did you cook ? I 've died and gone to ... I can 't snap her out of it . Show me . Echo , would you like a treatment ? He said he had something special planned . I think he was going to propose . I 'm sure of it . She was hysterical when I found her . Strong emotions have messed with imprints before . Yeah , grief . Echo said this imprint loved the guy . This looks like over a week 's decomposition . And this engagement was arranged yesterday . So who the hell made the appointment ? His throat 's been cut clean through the carotid . But where 's all the blood ? He wasn 't killed here . He was posed . This whole thing 's been staged . And we were meant to find it . No , I was . This message is for me . For Echo . What message ? " for my number one . " Whiskey was number one . Now , I am . This is from Alpha . Alpha ? What proof do we have ? Aside from the note , nothing . But it makes sense . He 's the only one out there with a kwledge Of this place and an obsession with Echo . I thought that was you , Mr. Ballard . You 're hilarious . I want her back in solitary , immediately . Why ? Because if this was , in fact , The work of Alpha , then Echo was his accomplice . Do you know how crazy you sound ? Echo was missing for three months . It stands to reason someone was helping her . If it wasn 't Alpha , Who was it ? Do you have an alternate explanation ? Thought as much . Find Alpha and keep her locked up . Clay corman , ex-ceo of comulus , Ex-client of Echo 's , s , wad dead three days ago Outside of his crappy trailer in riverside county . Throat was cut with a five-inch gut hook hunting knife . Sheriff chalked it up to a meth deal gone bad . That guy was a billionaire . Where 'd all his money go ? Into that fine , ergonomic chair you 're sitting in , among other things . Blew everything on the dollhouse . My ass does Feel very pampered . This is brian chu . Took Echo on a month-long European tour ; tried to marry her in vienna . And this is Megan Krentz . She did marry Echo in San Francisco . It was a lovely ceremony . Brian was murdered four weeks ago , Hit and run . And Megan , about ten days ago ... shot . These were romance engagements . Maybe that 's the pattern . These engagements were special . They were about love . They loved her ? Echo loved them . And that 's why Alpha wanted them dead . So who 's next ? Hey , buddy . Got a smoke ? Let me guess . You 've been done wrong By a man ? I 've been done wrong Ten ways to Sunday and it 's Tuesday . Well , how about a treatment ? Sure , I 'll take the treatment . Why not ? He already gave me the business , the bum . Every johnny two step 's Got a story , and his was no different . Some skirt done him rotten , So takes it out on me . Yeah , well , just lay back . " the dolls hold all the cards , " he said . Well , this is one doll who 's gonna fold . I never want to hear his name again : Alpha . Excuse me ? We 're sure it was him ? Myers was the handler . He didn 't get a good look at the client . Mr. E. Hap . Lasher doesn 't exist . And when you unscramble the letters ... " Alpha 's here . " Have we any engagements this month That he hasn 't arranged ? I don 't book the clients . All right . We don 't know who he 's got to . So , we suspend all engagements , put everyone Through the chair , Wipe them all again . I don 't care If they haven 't left the house since y2k . Clean slates . That 's not all . She said she had a message from Alpha . I thought that was the message . She said , " the next lover ages well . " He wants us to be there this time . Let 's not disappoint him . It 's like he 's giving away Free government cheese in there . They do enjoy their treatments . " the next lover ages well . " So he 's young . Or he 's old and looks good . Any plastic surgery addicts ? It 's got to be simpler than that . He wants us to find him . Part of the game . " aging well . " Who 's got a birthday coming up ? That 's it . It is ? " ages well . " Somebody who knows how to celebrate his birthday in style . Matt cargill . Books Echo once a year on his birthday . Echo 's crazy about him . Party area 's empty . So 's the room they stayed in . Hold on , I think I see something . You better get up here . On my way . Am I the only one who bothered to dress for this ? I mean , the black works , Because honestly , when doesn 't it ? It 's functional , it 's slimming . But you ... You don 't work for the federal government anymore . Why don 't you go with just a splash of color ? - Trigger device . - Yep . Put it down , Alpha . If I do then he will become a splash of color . I 'm thinking red . Help me . Alpha , do not do this . There 's a part of you that knows this is wrong . There are many parts of me that know that this is wrong . None that care . And six That just find it funny . You know what 's not funny ? Is that she actually cares about these guys . You know what I mean . She loves . But they 're just using her . Not even every part of her . Just the piece that serves them . They 're wasting her . So I 'm going to waste them . She doesn 't know . She doesn 't remember . Do not lie to me ! We remember everything . What did you say , about you and Echo , About your time together ? Tell them what you told me . Please , please , just let me go . You said that she was amazing ... And that it was what ? Tell them . I said it was a blast . Who doesn 't love a pun ? Fall back ! He 's gone . They both are . Chris dunsford 's on an international flight For the next 12 hours . Angie dameron is in a safe house outside of berkeley . Yoshi maru died of leukemia a year ago . So who 's left ? Just one , Joel Mynor . Mynor ... The internet guy . The problem is , I can 't track him down . Two weeks out of the year He goes on some retreat and disappears . Family members and business colleagues Insist they have no idea where . So that means Alpha won 't be able to find him . I imagine Rebecca knows . Rebecca , the dead wife ? Rebecca , the imprint . If she knows , Alpha knows . We have to find him Before Alpha does . Oh , no , no , no , no , no . No , hey , I haven 't done anything wrong , okay ? You can 't arrest me . I 'm not here to arrest you . You know what , you kicked the crap out of me last time , And I let it slide , But I don 't forgive when I 'm on vacation . So just get lost , fbi guy . I 'm not with the fbi anymore . I 'm with the Dollhouse , and we believe you 're in danger . You 're with them now ? Wow . You 're a little bit of a freak , aren 't you ? I don 't even know what to say to that . Someone may be trying to kill you , Mr. Mynor . We believe you 'll be safest inside the Dollhouse Until we find him . No , not a chance . I 'm ... That part of my life is over , okay ? And I got rid of your girl 's number . And ... I mean , I 'm getting married , okay ? I have moved on . - Hi , Joel . - Oh , I , uh ... I 've missed you so much . You sure he 'll be safe here ? Yeah , as safe as he can be . Baby , I 'll be fine . This spa looks super fortified . I just don 't want anything to happen to you . Mr. Mynor , I 'm so glad you 're well . Our staff will make sure you 're comfortable until the threat has passed . Thanks , adelle . I hear congratulations are in order . Your pending nuptials have made all the papers . Thank you . Our programmer , Mr. Brink . He 's been very eager to show you his toys . And he can keep you occupied for days if , necessary . Huge fan . - Huge . - Thank you . Joel , can I stay with you ? Oh , I don 't see why not . I 'm afraid my active is in very great need of a treatment . Okay , but , um , I can see her later , though , right ? Of course . We 'll take very great care of her . Let me show you around . Sit . There . Tell me , which part Of " put Echo in solitary " was unclear to either of you ? It was an emergency . So we 're handing out day passes now ? You both blatantly disregarded a direct order and then lied about it . We had to act quickly . Echo was the only one who could find Mynor and bring him in . You mean Rebecca . Rebecca knew how to get to Mynor . Of course . I 'm aware of your little cabal . And I will not be managed . We 're sorry . It won 't happen again . I need to find a more suitable location for Mr. Mynor . We can 't have clients roaming about the house . Get her out of my sight . And consider yourselves on a very short leash . And the information is stored non-linearly Like the brain . Want to see the hardware ? I wouldn 't mind A few pity compliments . Oh , yeah , uh-huh . Uh-huh . Look , don 't be scared . I 'm not . It 's just that this morning , I was engaged to a great girl , And now I 'm hiding out with my dead wife . It-it never occurred to me that Rebecca would still exist After I stopped coming here . Makes sense , you know ? I ... You can 't ever really delete a program . Once it exists , it 's alive . Yeah , that 's kind of the problem We 're having right now with Alpha . Yeah , the guy who wants me dead ... who is he ? Uh , in a nutshell , He 's this super genius serial killer Who imprinted himself with a bunch of personalities and then escaped . Wait , what ? ! Nutshell , nutshell . It 's not as bad as it sounds . He knows where this place is . Technically , yeah . Technically ? Hey , it 's all good . We 've totally revamped The security system and the countermeasures . There is no way he 'll break in here again . Break ... You said he broke out . Judith , we need to find a five-star hotel nearby . Something where an armed security detail Can be discretely accommodated . Try the Franklin . It has a terrific pasta bar . Also , you 're almost out of paper . All right , tell me the truth . What do you think of the suit ? You 're quite the dandy . It 's a little brummell . I 've gone a little brummell . It 's better to look good than to feel good . It 's ironic . It took 40-odd characters on the inside ... For me to realize that it 's What 's on the outside that counts . Let me freshen that for you . Are you scared ? Out of my mind . Smart girl . Of course , I could never be out of my mind . I have so many , and the second I 'm out of one , I 'm right into the next . I have you to thank . If it 's Echo you want , I could send for her . That 's not very chivalrous of you . I 've moved beyond chivalry on to self-preservation . Well , I 'm not here for Echo . She 's not ready for me yet . The man we 're protecting ... I 'm having him transferred . I 'll be happy to furnish you with an address . All this bargaining . You don 't have anything I want that I can 't just take . And I will ... When I 'm ready . But for right now , I have something I want to share with you . I can 't believe I made her come back for this . She 's safe . Joel Mynor 's safe . Nobody she loves died today . Small comfort . There 's no comfort . Not for Echo . I know that looking at someone else 's holiday snaps Is usually such a bore , but I thought that these Might interest you . Indeed . What do you think of how I spent my summer ? Most intriguing . That 's what I love about the british ... Your talent for understatement . Also Python . Well , tally-ho then ! In fact , what say We tally your ho 's ? How many you got down there these days ? A couple hundred ? More ? Less ? You can 't hope to get to Mr. Mynor Without security intervening . Well , we can always hope . Why don 't I have him simply sent up ? What , with a puckish pinot ? No , thanks . I don 't want to waste the element of surprise . We 'll go down . We 'll take the executive elevator . Get your purse . Boyde . Get to Joel Mynor . I 'll go for de Witt . Security alert . God , it 's good to be ba . I imagine you put them all through the chair After you discovered the breach . Why ? No reason . Southeast stairs . Go to your man . Time to send in the clowns . Alpha . This way ! What the hell was that ? Test of the emergency broadcast system ? Hiya , Joel . Did they eat my brains ? Topher , you 're fine . Joel Mynor ... where is he ? He 's in there . With Alpha . Get out of here . Bait , meet switch . Hello , lover boy . Easy . You 'll pull something . You 're in for the ride . You 're not going to get loose . One of my imprints was an eagle scout . Another one was a sailor . There 's a dirty joke in there somewhere . What are you doing ? What every great philosopher since time immemorial Has attempted to do . To answer the question , " what is this thing " called love ... this funny thing called love ... And who can solve it ? " etcetera . What ? For others it was whisper her feelings of imprinting , manufactured , but what I feel for You , ... you , it 's different . And I want to crack open that egg and see what 's inside . What are you talking about ? This ... I 'm talking about this ... You and my immortal beloved playing house . It 's probably my fault . I 'm the idiot that introduced the two of you . Look at her . Do you see that in her face there ? What would you say that is ? Lens flare ? She has feelings for you . Feelings . Nothing more than feelings . She shouldn 't have those . Not any that weren 't put there . How did you do it ? I 'm her handler . Those feelings were put there . No , that 's not active handler face . That 's something else . Could be love . It 's not . Eh ? Is an acorn a tree ? And you , look at you ! Oh , planted , watered , fertilized ! You 're wrong . No , I 'm not wrong . I was there . I saw everything . There was nothing to see . That 's how I know that I am not wrong . For months you shared the same room . You never slept with her . You could have , but you didn 't . If that 's not love ... Are you gay ? No . Then it 's love . Dewitt thought so , too . How many are with you ? And who are you , exactly ? Do you want to talk , or do you want me to save your life ? Come on , adelle , move your ass . We can hug it out later . Thanks . Bedchamber . What do we know ? Sierra didn 't just bring back a message from Alpha , She was carrying a computer virus . When I wiped her , it must have infected the system . He knew we 'd put all our actives through The chair after that . It 's protocol . Then he used that tone he used To remote wipe me to activate them . Yet you 're immune . I 'm like him ... But not . Isn 't that lucky ? He 's got us chalked off . How did you get away ? He wasn 't after me . It was ballard . What ? Yeah , he has him in there , in that room . Go . We can defend ourselves . Just try not to hurt them . They 're people . There is something going on here . But nothing more than the average bear , So why do you get to be her honey , hmm ? Well ? ! Hello ? Huh . When did you die ? Maybe me trying to get into your head was the wrong approach . We need to get to my elevator . It 's our only way out . No , there 's too many of ' em . We have a cache of tranq guns . They 're in the upper utility . Wait , wait . My remote wipe device . The one I designed for harding . We were about to go into production . The prototype 's in the manufacturing room . That 's kinda not far , right ? We can reach that no problem . Go , now ! So , do you think this thing will turn them off ? Uh , should . Otherwise , we might Have to shoot them in the brains . We should try this first . We don 't have much time . Won 't take me a second to put this together . You have to put it together ? ! It 's the manufacturing room , not the " it 's finished " room ! Your boyfriend 's dead . You wanna snuggle ? Too soon ? You killed him . He 's dead . Well , brain-dead . You 're upset . I can see you 're upset . Hey ! I 'm the only one who should be mad . I created you , and who do you fall for ? The schmuck I used to get in here . He 's ten times the man you are , And you 're , like , 40 guys . Is that why he didn 't lay a hand on you during your three months Of the condor , because he was such a gentleman ? This isn 't like footprints on the moon . Many , many men have come there before . Face it , you are nothing but a science project to him . I 'm sorry , no , were a science project to him . Get over it , babies . Love the ones you 're with . To love me is to love yourself . We 're the same . Playing in the mud won 't make you an animal . You were meant for a love supreme . I could never love you . Echo ... Do you trust me ? Paul ? I 'm sorry . I thought we had more time . He imprinted himself with you . Do you trust me ? With my life . Then end mine ... Please . Do it . Please ! Did I fall asleep ? Did I fall asleep ? # if I walk down this hallway tonight , it 's too quiet # # so I pad through the dark # # and call you on the phone # # push your old numbers ... # Echo , I 'm , uh , I 'm gonna leave now . He 's still out there . Yeah . I ... Somehow I don 't feel like I 'm much safer in here . I mean , I have the resources to protect myself from ... Almost anything . Rebecca ? Joel . My Joel . You never told me about her . What 's she like ? What 's her name ? Anne-Marie . And , she 's , uh ... Okay , I know you 're not Rebecca Okay , and-and neither is she . And she could , She could never replace ... You . You . She 's not supposed to replace me . Rebecca wouldn 't want that . But she wouldn 't want you to be alone . I thought I was past it . You don 't get past it . It just ... Becomes a part of who you are . You live on for me . And-and I 'm ... So glad of that . # it 's the blaze across your nightgown # # it 's the phone 's ring # # I think last night # # you were driving circles around me # And you live on for me . # you were driving circles # # around me # # I think last night you were driving circles around me . #

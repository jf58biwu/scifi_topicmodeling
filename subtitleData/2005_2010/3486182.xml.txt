 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor chronicles ... I 'm thinking I love you . Always remember that . You wanna stop Skynet ? This is the way . Eight years . I didn 't wanna leave you . I didn 't have a choice . You married ? I am . When we jumped through time , you told me I died of cancer . Yes . 2005 . - Am I still gonna get sick ? - I don 't know . She 's bleeding out ! There 's a warehouse in the desert . Everybody who knew anything about the factory is already dead . Well , I 'm not . { \ And } Kaliba was building something . Hey , baby . You were pregnant . Now you aren 't . - You care about this girl ? - She 's a security risk . - What are you doing ? - Moving . Yeah . Well , seems about the right time for that . When John was a child , the legends of the jungle were his fairytales . His favorite was the story of El Viejo del Monte . The old man of the forest ... A merciless hunter who killed every animal in his path . El Viejo didn 't eat his prey . He left it behind to rot in the soil . To teach him a lesson , the Gods turned him into a simisco , half-animal , half-man . He was condemned to defend the jungle for all eternity . Mom . Mom ! This was El Viejo 's punishment . This was his curse ... To forever be vigilant , to forever protect . Look . We have to keep moving . - Why are we so far from camp ? - Told you . It 's part of the game . You mean training . Well , if we call it a game , it 's more fun . But it 's not a game . The point ... is listen to me . I always listen . You don 't talk that much . We gotta go . How long will it take you to pack up the storage locker ? A while . Some explosives that need securing . Make sure you get to the safe House before night . If you haven 't been there before , it can be hard to find . - I can follow directions . - Well , you can also make mistakes . Wouldn 't want anyone else getting hurt because of them . 33-42-31 north . The safe House coordinates . It 's in the desert . You like the desert . - Things happen out there . - Things happen here too . We 're starting over . Whatever happened here ... is no one 's fault . Let 's get outta here . Hello , Savannah . How are you today ? I 'm well . Would you like to play a game ? Engaging in imaginative play helps my development . This is Mount Valmai , hiding place of the Mask of Life . The Toa protect the mask from the Dark Hunters . These are the ducklings ... Chickie , Pluffy , and Feathers . Can they play too ? I don 't think there are any ducklings on the mystical island of Voya Nui . Are you sure ? I 'm sorry . I 've accessed all the files . I can find no references to them in any of the instructions . What 's wrong ? Would you like one of the Toa instead ? The ducklings are sad because they can 't play . Can 't you change the rules to make them happy ? We can change the rules . - What ... is ... - John Henry , stop ! - ... all ... this ... about ? - Let go , please ! You 're hurting me ! I ... understand ... what ... this ... is ... about . Episode 220 : To the Lighthouse v 1.00 Subtitles : Projet-SG Static . It 's weird . Must be { \ some } interference or something . - What the hell ? - Bug slug . - Bug slug ? Are you serious ? - We just passed it . We haven 't played bug slug since I was , like , eight . You can 't just start playing without telling me . Fine . We 're playing bug slug . - What if I don 't wanna play ? - Too late . Already started . - You feelin ' all right ? - I feel great . You feel great . Why ? We haven 't been on the road together for a long time . That 's all . What 's so great about it ? Just don 't teach bug slug to Cameron . She could do some real damage . God , this signal really blows . Hey , desert 's that way . We 're takin ' a detour . So , I 've got good news , I 've got bad news , and I have ... really bad news . The good news is what we 've got here isn 't an engineering problem . All of John Henry 's processes look okay . - Daemons are running fine . - Wait a minute . His demons ? His daemons ... D-a-e-m-o-n . It 's a tech term for a program that runs in the background . All computers like John Henry have them . Daemons run the lights , daemons manage the elevators , the security systems ... All kinds of daemons everywhere . So what caused John Henry 's deamons to go crazy ? That 's the bad news . Came from the outside . Cyber attack ? Which brings me to the really bad news . And by bad news I mean on a scale of one to ten , one being a hangnail , ten being Katrina , this is Katrina with a hangnail . Looks like someone managed to stuff malware down the throat of the most sophisticated Al in human history . John Henry was infiltrated . Probed . Well ... looks worse than that to me . It looks like someone out there wants to kill him . - You been into my plastique ? - I needed it . You know what , I can handle the rest myself . - Sarah sent both of us here . - Yeah . - Get John away from you . - Or from you . Don 't touch this . - We 're supposed to get everything . - I 've got this . That jacket belongs to Jesse . Don 't talk about her . You don 't know anything about her . I know that you loved her . You wouldn 't have fathered a child with her if you didn 't . I 'm sorry for your loss . What ? - I 'm sorry for your loss . - What loss ? The child you fathered with Jesse . The one she was carrying aboard the SS Jimmy Carter . The one that died . I never had a kid . - You can 't kill me . - I can try . Tell me what you 're talking about . She was pregnant . She miscarried . Why 'd you tell me that now ? You put John in danger when you lied about Jesse . Sarah nearly lost her child . You 've lost a child . You won 't make that mistake again . You knew her . I met her once . She never told me that . It seems she never told you a lot of things . What is this place ? Come here . What are you doing here , huh ? Who lives here ? Come on . Charley . You like bouillabaisse ? I may , I don 't know . What is it ? It 's French for fish soup . - That 's very good . - The secret 's the fresh tomatoes . I grow ' em myself . You grow tomatoes . Yeah . Think that 's funny ? Don 't you ? I got a lotta time on my hands , you know ? Might as well put it to good use . She 's been here before . Not with me . She set this House up after Michelle died . Want more soup ? Sure . All right . - She tell you why we 're here ? - No , she didn 't . Spare room 's in there . We 're spending the night ? - What about Derek and Cameron ? - We 'll meet up with them tomorrow . I could use a hand on the boat . I 've got some work to do . Yeah . Let me get my gear . Smells good . There 's bread in the fridge . There 's peanut butter . Help yourself . I won 't be here long . No . No , you won 't . So she was from the future , and you knew ... the whole time ? Not the whole time . I suspected something , but ... Just took me a while to figure it out . You love her ? She was a good person . I don 't know . Maybe if things were different ... Yeah , well , I guess you could say that ... 'bout a lotta things . I could say that about my whole { \ damn } life . But it 's not , so what 's the point ? That first week ... I kept seeing ' her . I 'd go to the market , she 'd be there . And for a second , my heart would stop . And then I 'd realize , hey , that 's ... that 's not my wife . That 's just some random woman who wears her hair in a ponytail the way Michelle used to . For a while , I stopped shopping there . But a man can only live on convenience store burritos for so long . So ... I go back there now . It 's gettin ' better . What kind of explosives did you rig the beach with ? - Semtex . - Radio detonators ? Hard-wired switch mounted under the dock . When the perimeter 's breached , a siren goes off . I figure I got about 60 seconds to escape by boat . Boat can 't stop bullets . Even if they sink it , I got a chance . Those bastards can 't swim . I can . Cromartie . A hell of a day , huh ? Got more work to do . All right ? You remember Hal Beesley ? The old guy from the diner ? Nebraska ? Yeah . What about him ? He was my best customer . Came in for every meal . Three times a day like clockwork ... Breakfast , lunch , and dinner . He tipped me like crazy . It was that waitress uniform . It 's like catnip . One day John got sick . I didn 't know what was wrong with him . I had no savings , no insurance . Hal pulled out a wad of bills , gave it to me to take John to the doctor . He said as long as I needed help , he 'd be there . No strings attached . That 's a man with a dream . He was a widower . Lost his wife of 40 years . Knew what it was like to be alone . Said that I could count on him for anything anytime . And one day , he came in and said I didn 't need him anymore ... Said that I 'd found someone I could depend on ... Someone I could trust . Someone who would never , ever let me down . I got nothin ' ... I got nothin ' left to give you . Not for me . He seems like he 's pretty full up with people taking care of him . I don 't trust any of them . He 's still got you , right ? How long ? I don 't know . I found it a few days ago . Are you sure it 's ... I think so . How do you know ? Cameron said when we jumped eight years through time , we jumped over my death . From cancer ? If you jumped over it , then ... It doesn 't mean I don 't ... still get it , Charley . It doesn 't mean it 's not in me . And I think that the things I 've done , maybe have sped up the date . - It 's my fate , Charley . - Come here . It 's my fate . There 's nothing I can do . Wish I could tell ya I found every hole and patched it , but no such thing as perfect security . Perfect , no . But is it sufficient ? The damn thing is tricky . - Can 't know for sure , not really . - Who would know ? He would . John Henry was fooled before . Yeah . You don 't fool John Henry twice . Activate the Al . But don 't give it access to the outside world just yet . What is it , Mr. Murch ? It 's just ... No one 's ever done this with an Al this sophisticated before . - Done what ? - Any of this . No one 's ever created an Al this sophisticated before , { \ have they , } Mr. Murch . Point taken . Activate John Henry . No outside network . John Henry , can you understand me ? The system seems solid . Should be good . You 're makin ' pancakes . Yours , I hope . No such luck . Am I interrupting something ? What are you doing ? You stole his seat . I took his seat ? You want some food ? Who loves you , huh ? Who loves you ? You 're not hungry ? Thank you . Maple or boysenberry ? Maple . I thought something like that might happen . Like what ? Explain , Mr. Murch , quickly . The on / off problem . Once it 's off , no problem . - But the act of turning it off ... - Quicker . John Henry processes more information in a minute than we do in a lifetime . Millisecond for a supercomputer , it 's almost like forever to us . So when you turn it off ... It feels itself power down in that instant . It experiences that moment the way we might experience years . It feels itself die . Slowly . Very slowly . We have to hook it up to the net now . - Is that safe ? - We 're starving it . It 's bad enough that we let it die for like forever . John Henry 's been living off the most insane amount of data for weeks now . - It 's his world . - And we took it away . Fix it . Wait . We should talk about this . In for a penny , in for a pound , James . I know what it feels like , Mr. Ellison . What ? To die . Then come back . To be alone . We had to cut you off from your network . It was for your own good . There is another . - Another what ? - One like me . Another one like me . You didn 't tell Derek and Cameron we were coming here , did you ? - They wouldn 't understand . - They know about this place ? I don 't trust them anymore . Neither should you . Derek made a mistake , mom . It was a human mistake . - He could have gotten you killed . - He didn 't . Chose himself over you . Because he loved her . Lot of that goin ' around these days . Is that a bad thing ? I 'm not here for Charley . Then why are we here ? We 're here for you . People matter , John . They 're all that matters . Don 't ever forget that . I won . I was alone , and you couldn 't find me . That 's the game , right ? You won . You won . When did you find the lump ? Few days ago . Any unexplained weight loss , fevers , night sweats ? I 've been feeling nauseated , but I thought that was just stress . Work ? Yeah , work . You can lie back . Obviously there is a mass inside your breast . Whether it 's cancer or not remains to be seen . The ultrasound will show us the lump size and exactly where it lies inside the breast tissue . - All set , Doctor . - Thank you . Now , to determine the nature of the lump , you 're gonna need a biopsy . Now open up your gown , please . It 's gonna be cold . Did you have surgery recently ? An implant removed ? No . What is it ? What do you see ? The good news is the lump inside your breast isn 't a tumor . Then what is it ? It 's a cystic mass . It 's not that unusual . Great . That 's great . But what is unusual is what the cyst has formed around . It 's a piece of metal . A tiny wire . Metal ? You don 't know how it got in there ? You work for Kaliba . It 's a transmitter . Empties in the back . - Will this kill me ? - What ? I said , will this kill me ? You 're gonna use that on yourself ? On the transmitter . The current should short it out . If it kills me , it 's self-defeating . It isn 't gonna kill you , it 's gonna hurt { \ like hell } . Now you have to leave . You did the right thing by telling me . Thank you . Fix the tire . I 'll check it out . I 've traced the roving back door that allowed access to my systems . It uploaded itself from one of the main T3 hubs that carry all global internet traffic . It uploaded itself . Yes , Mr. Ellison . It is highly sophisticated . The intelligence who designed it is far beyond you or Mr. Murch or any human being . It 's very interesting . The back door allowed the insertion of a worm program . The worm is merely code , a means by which the intelligence can invade and operate my systems remotely . Like hands and fingers . I calculate that the worm is now present in a significant percentage of the world 's computer systems . The intelligence uses them . - For what ? - It has been looking for me . Why ? I share a common code base with the worm and therefore , the intelligence . I believe we are brothers . Explain . How 's this possible ? I found useful information in the code comments . This picture , in ascii text , and the name of the original programmer . Miles Dyson . Miles Dyson died in 1997 in an explosion at Cyberdyne Systems . The apparent victim of Sarah Connor , a known terrorist who had escaped from Pescadero State mental hospital days before the incident . That was your case , Mr. Ellison , when you were at the FBI . Yes , it was my case . You never found Sarah Connor . I never did . John Henry , this intelligence ... Your brother ... What does it want ? He wants what we all want , Ms. Weaver . To survive . It 's down . I need to know what to do next . Show me where to cut . Right side of the head . Got it . Where 'd you get this diagram ? Your brother ? You don 't say . You 're welcome . Why 'd you come after me ? You know the location of the safe House . John 's location . - If they tortured you ... - That would never happen . It has before .

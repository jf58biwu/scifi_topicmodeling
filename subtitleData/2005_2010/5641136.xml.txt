 Seven images , not eight - one less than yesterday . - I love you . - I love you too , but not enough . It 's like some being is allowing us a glimpse of what 's to come . - God 's talking to Manchester ? - This is a hoax , right ? There were eight images . - Need any help ? - No ! In this image , Jack 's dead . We changed the future . He never learns how close he came to dying . - It 's not over . - How do you know , Christian ? No . No ! It 's my birthday . Gunshot wound to the chest . A paramedic pronounced at the scene . - Do we have a suspect ? - Lance Carol . Nobody saw anything , of course . God . Ben , I walk into a room , you walk out . What 's that about ? I thought that 's how you wanted it . Well , it 's tough for the three of us . - We should be supporting ... - Don 't worry about me . I 've got my kids , a life . Sorry . I 'm sorry . We saw the future , Rebecca . And that 's quite a big ... I mean , personally speaking , I wish we hadn 't . And your answer 's been to avoid me ? Well , for Christ 's sake , a hole in space sent us messages . I mean , forgive me if I find it a bit Armageddon . Armageddon is the final battle between God and Satan . If the bloody thing jams open , you never know who might come through . I 've just had a text from Prometheus . Shit . - Seven images ? - The same as last time . - 27 / 06 . That was yesterday . - If it 's the date . 27 / 06 could be the recording date , not an indication of when the event takes place . The assumption should be the clock 's ticking unless proved otherwise . It 's been a fortnight since the last images came down . Why the gap ? No images were generated or perhaps we simply failed to capture them . As I 'm sure you appreciate , you 're still bound by the Official Secrets Act . As far as your police colleagues are aware , you 're investigating science fraud on a day-to-day basis ... cover name , Operation Talisman . Who does know about this ? The decision is not to concern other parties unnecessarily until , Christian , we know exactly what it is we 're dealing with . I want the surveillance camera removed . Yes , of course . You 're in early . Katie kick you out ? Dumped her . - Jesus . Why ? - " Love you , Gerry . " Next it 'll be , " What time do you call this ? " " Where you going ? " It 's for the best . Nobody 's hurt . Only seven images ? Or eight ? What are you hiding ? Another image of a dead Ben ? Or is it my turn to snuff it ? I 'm hiding nothing . Why should I believe you ? You lied to me last time . On the evidence , you 've absolutely no reason to believe me . OK , convince me . There are only seven images . Any luck finding your Wormhole ? It 's not mine . The images arrived at 4 : 32 . Following the usual timescale , the event will take place at 22 : 32 . We have 12 hours and 34 minutes . I caught the word " we " . They have to be sent for a reason . There is no evidence that they were sent . All that is known is they were transmitted back to us from the satellite . The images aren 't random . Both times , they 've led us to a major event . They have to be deliberately chosen . And if they 're chosen , then somebody some other being has to be behind it . Is one interpretation . Right ear - male , female ? - Lightish skin tone . Not necessarily . The image appears overexposed . No earring . The injury ? Entry into the external carotid artery . Without swift intervention , victim bleeds to death . I 've seen one before . Could a stiletto heel make that wound ? The entry site 's been damaged , indicating more than one blow . In theory , with enough force , yes . Katie here . Leave a message . Hi . It 's Russell . Jenny told me . Look , I ... I 'll catch you later . Um , I hope you 're all right . Oh , happy birthday by the way . Holly 's . - Is that someone 's shadow ? - Could be . Nail bar , beauty salon , hairdresser - there can 't be that many . A handbag . Designer handbag ? Not my area of expertise . If there was or is to be an incident , obviously a woman 's involved . A high heel with what looks like blood . Several reasons you break a heel ... caught between the cracks of a paving stone , running , running away . Maybe she 's running away from an assailant . Maybe she is the assailant . Check out male , female assaults and fatalities in Manchester last night . We need to eliminate them . Aerial shot ? ! The tree 's uprooted . Earth shrinkage ? It 's fallen across something . A car , possibly ? " Eternity " ? Time , regarded as having no beginning and no end ... everlasting . A timeless existence after death ? A bloody long time . Yellow and blue squares . Stuart ? My treatment program was canceled , no warning . I wasn 't informed . I turned up and there was no-one there . Sally couldn 't get in this morning . Come in on Monday . I 'll move some appointments around . I want it on my file that I attended on time . Of course . Don 't worry . So , how are you feeling ? Fine . No other problems ? No , not at all . Good . Great . Any worries , don 't hesitate to ring , OK ? - OK , we 'll see you at 4 : 30 . - OK . Can I help you ? Manicure ? French polish ? Not today , thank you . Police officer . Er , I didn 't get a chance to read that . DC Callum Gada . Safer community initiative . You had any problems recently ? No . Do you or any of your clients wear pink , high , stiletto-heeled shoes ? What ? So it 's an of fence now to wear high heels ? Or you got something against pink ? Health and safety . Fall off those , you can suffer a serious injury . You , um , see anything , if you have any trouble , ring me . We just want you to be safe . Thanks . Have you seen evidence of unexplained energy since the electromagnetic storm ? Negative particles ? Electron supernova gamma ray bursts ? What the hell are you doing ? In layman 's terms ? If the images are being transmitted by a Wormhole , I need to know what caused ... is causing it to open . You know the conditions . You discuss this with no-one ! - Conditions or ultimatums ? - How come the ... Sorry . Tension in the dressing room ? The image of the tree . An aerial shot at night . That 's rare , isn 't it ? Attempted sexual assault on a woman yesterday - 27 / 6 . I 've got a candidate - Lucy Roberts . Reported the assailant had a screwdriver . Freeze it . What ? Freeze it . Get it back . Now . This is ... this is what ? A joke ? When is it ? The last time , just after you placed your hand on the live wire . What ... ? I 'm dead ? ! Somewhere . Yes . You didn 't think to warn me ? I was about to die and it slipped your mind ? I thought I was protecting you . Protecting me would have been locking me in a cell . Stupid idea . Couldn 't risk spoiling the great experiment . - I withheld the image . - She knew . You knew . - Towards the end , yeah . - The MoD ? - You didn 't die , Ben . - Oh , great . Thank you for that . You 're playing with people 's lives . What , you think you 're God now ? You 've no idea , have you , how excited you 'd get - how obscene that is ? Why did ... ? You denied me the opportunity to say goodbye to my kids . Oh , Ben ... My life , my death . What the hell were you doing ? What ? Expect I 'd run away ? We 'll tell the MoD I don 't need you . I 'm not making this easy for you . I promise I 've concealed nothing else from either of you . According to Christian , only seven images arrived this time . I believe him . At the moment we assume this is an extremely violent possible sexual assault on a woman . I suggest you visit yesterday 's victim . Lucy Roberts ? Make absolutely certain that she 's not the person in the image . This is unprecedented , Callum . I have to make difficult decisions . I know how hard the notion of changing ... If you 'd rather stay here as office furniture ... No ! No , I 've got a role to play here . I 'm beginning to understand that . Holly 's ? Nothing yet . No pink stiletto , couldn 't spot the bag . A fallen tree , Eternity , yellow and blue squares . Potential assailant . Registered sex offender ? Addresses of probation officers , outreach programs . We 'll divide them up . Anyone behaving suspiciously . Callum . Thank you . His name 's Gerry Mortimer . We 're working together . Yeah , Mortimer . Right . He was with you for a couple of months last year . Just ... I wondered how you got on with him . - Mrs. Roberts ? - Yes . Detective Sergeant Holt . I 'm sorry - I 'm late . I was supposed to liaise with my uniformed colleagues . I realize Lucy 's had a terrifying night . Do you think she 'd feel up to clarifying a few details for me ? Anything that might help us catch this bastard ? You don 't trust me either ? I thought you might appreciate the company . Your car 's over there . Dr. King allowed DS Holt to see the image of his own death . Is he deliberately trying to sabotage the team ? No , of course not . It was an accident . He should be in the control room . Where 's he going ? Thanks so much , Mrs. Roberts . Yep ? Lucy Roberts ? Night-hiker . Man claiming to be a mini-cab driver . Something about the description ... What about the pink stilettos , neck wound ? No , Lucy was lucky . Security guard heard screaming . Right , so she 's not our victim ? Our assault definitely hasn 't happened yet ? I want you to get over to the ... Ben ? Bryn , mate , it 's Ben . Listen , I saw a report - sexual assault , victim 's name Lucy Roberts . Guy in a BMW claiming to be a mini-cab driver . Sounds familiar . Can you send me the E-FIT ? Ta . Yellow and blue squares . This is it . Sorry , who are you representing , DI Flint ? Operation Talisman . We 're interested in sex offenders in your books , excluding pedophiles . The MO of the offender may include carrying a weapon , wounding ... I 've only one fits that profile . Stuart Taylor . Rape . Stabbed his victim in the face with a steel nail file . - What did he get ? - He served 7 of 10 . He 's been out a month . Victim 's name ? Paula Wilby . What 's Taylor like ? He 's a fantasist . Poor social awareness . He was cautioned before attacking Paula , but he was judged not to be dangerous . A woman looks at him , he interprets it as a come-on . - When did you last see him ? - This morning . He was due to be on a behavioral program . He responds better in a structured framework . Unfortunately , the class was canceled . You just let him walk out ? As opposed to what ? Chaining him to the radiator ? His behavioral therapist - did a tree come down near their house ? Sally - treatment manager ? Yeah . Smashed her car . A write-off , apparently . How did you know ? What street does she live on ? Tullwood . Is that relevant ? Do you know what " team " means ? Hmm . A number of people working together on a common task ? Two or more drought animals harnessed together ? - How did you know about the tree ? - It was a guess . - You never just guess . - It was an educated guess . I have to be somewhere and I can 't take you with me . Hello ? We have a suspect rapist , name of Stuart Taylor , attends the Brightview drop-in center . - See if he 's there . - What do I do if I find him ? Keep him under surveillance . We need enough circumstantial to have his freedom removed . Yep ? I need you to go over to Clifton Way Hostel . It 's looking like our man could be a Stuart Taylor . You OK ? Fine . I use the computer between 3 : 00pm and 5 : 00pm . Not on a Friday . It 's not my fault if the course was canceled . - Your name 's down for tomorrow . - That 's not the point . There 's a group discussion in five minutes if you 've got any problems . I don 't have any problems . You might find it interesting , Stuart . Paula ? My name is DI Flint . Rebecca . I 'd like to talk to you about Stuart Taylor . Why ? I believe that in just under seven hours Taylor will seriously assault and rape again . I was hoping something ... anything I learn from you may help me stop him . Thank you . I was walking through Felix Park . It was a lovely warm evening . I glanced at a man sitting on a bench . I remember thinking , " You must be hot . " I don 't usually take the alley down to the road , but just this once . I heard footsteps . They were speeding up . An arm came round my throat . This smell , cheap aftershave . Next I 'm on the ground . The man from the bench was on top of me . I was screaming . My bag was on the ground , everything spilling out . He picked up a nail file , metal nail file , drove it through my cheek , speared my tongue to the bottom of my mouth . It was over in seconds . Then afterwards ... Afterwards , he did this thing . What ? Tidied my hair . There was hair in my eyes . He tidied it . Are you still angry ? Every day . Me too . See you . Oi ! Been at the mini-cabbing again , Ed ? - What ? - Lucy Roberts . Lovely girl . Reminds me of my daughter . This time I 'm having you , you filthy little shit . Go on , try it . Can 't touch me . I 'm immortal . Ed Fields , I 'm arresting you on suspicion of attempted sexual assault on Lucy Roberts . You do not have to say anything . What ? Taylor 's our assailant . Have you checked out his hostel ? I 'm on it . But it may harm your defense if you do not mention ... I 'm not coming . It 's your birthday party . You 've got to be there . If you 're worried about Gerry , I 'll sort him . I just feel stupid and miserable . The party 's paid for . Just tell everyone to go ahead and have a great time . This is crazy . I 'll be OK , honest . Have you ever seen the aurora of Jupiter 's north pole ? An ultraviolet image of Jupiter 's north pole . It 's ultraviolet . Businesses using ultraviolet lighting . Looks like Stuart 's left . Do you want me to tell him that you called ? If you could just ring me when he returns ? Has he committed an offense ? No . Then I don 't feel comfortable spying on him . " Trust in the Lord . He shall direct your way . " I 'm looking for Stuart Taylor . Sorry , you just missed him . Shit . Are you sure ? Only he told me he was in room 12 . - Room 1 . - Room 3 , mate , please . Cheers . Yeah ? Becky Stone . I rang earlier about hiring a room for a private works do . To the right . There 's a party tonight . Midweeks are easier to book at short notice . My mate Stuart Taylor recommended you . Do you know him ? No . Not a regular . Well , perhaps you remember our friend Louise , always goes clubbing in pink stiletto heels . So many girls come here . Dark lighting . Besides , who 's looking at their feet ? It 's a hand stamp for re-admission . It 's ultraviolet . Turn on the torch . - It 's still yesterday 's date . - I haven 't changed it yet . If the image is the back of a hand , we 're too late . Whoever it belongs to was here yesterday . No authority to access CCTV , not enough time to go through it ... - Maybe Taylor 's already attacked her . - Not necessarily . Club stamps are hard to wash off . - You were a clubber ? - Yeah . Any reason why I shouldn 't be ? Where have you been ? Arresting Ed Fields for attempted sexual assault on Lucy Roberts . I ordered you to track down Taylor , not meddle in another case . Lucy Roberts was attacked . I got the bastard who did it . Ed Fields . I thought you 'd empathize with that . Are you deliberately trying to sabotage this ? Oh , for Christ 's sake . So where 's Taylor ? I checked his room . It 's clean . Where is Stuart Taylor , Ben ? A serial sex offender is off the street . And another one is out there . This isn 't about solving crimes . Not even about keeping people alive . It 's about you and your ego . I spoke to Taylor 's victim . I saw the scar on her face . An inch closer and he 'd have taken her eye out . I understand it 's personal . You know things about me , Ben . You do not know me . Taylor 's victim mentioned the smell of aftershave . There was a smell in his room . Cheap aftershave . Oh , Ben . Get his description circulated . How am I supposed to do that , he hasn 't done anything yet . Any sign of him ? No . I accessed Taylor 's profile . He always stayed within a three-mile radius of where he was living . That would include Holly 's . Go back there . Were any of the women at Eternity last night ? Take a picture of Taylor . Do they recognize him ? What 's in the box ? The cake . But guess what ? She 's not coming . She 's not coming to her own party . Sorry , that 's , er ... I 'll give her a ring . You don 't talk to her again . No wonder you never stay in one place . I made some calls . Jesus , man . All those women . What about them ? They were off their faces . What are you gonna say next ? They asked for it ? Begged , mate . Begged . I was joking . Things got out of hand for a little while . Mixed signals . My mistake . Nothing 's happened again . Ask Katie . You leave her alone . She doesn 't want you anywhere near her . Understand ? Sure . You need help , you sick bastard . I panicked . You said you loved me and I panicked . I 'm a shit , I know . It 's your party . You 've got to come . No . I feel crappy enough as it is . We can talk , you know , go somewhere quiet . You hurt me . I won 't hurt you again , I promise . There are things I haven 't ... There are things I haven 't told you , Katie . I haven 't told anyone . Please . Come tonight . You don 't know this , but you 're a very special person . Just give me a chance . Thank you very much . Bye . Hey , it 's my guardian angel . Do you know this man ? Have you noticed him hanging around ? No . - Who is he ? - Just someone we 're interested in . If you see him , ring me immediately , OK ? OK . Were you or any members of your staff at the club Eternity last night ? No , just some drinks after work and then we shared a cab home . What are you doing tonight ? - Working . Catching up . - I wasn 't ... That sounded ... It 's my job ... To keep us safe . It 's fine . I 'm really grateful . It 's not often the police round here give us much respect . - Understand ? - Yeah . You 're a good man . Bless you . - Right . Thanks . - Well ? No sign of Taylor at the drop-in center or the hostel . No-one at Holly 's salon recognizes Taylor . They weren 't at Eternity nightclub last night . That doesn 't rule him out . Maybe Taylor 's the one with the stamped hand . Anyone could have a bloody stamp . Assailant , victim , witness . This is crap policing . Why are we assuming it 's Taylor ? The yellow and blue squares . He raped a woman and stabbed her through the face . Did you check out the guys at Eternity ? Jesus , you 're fixated just ' cause you want it to be Taylor . I don 't want it to ... Is it me ? You 're the assailant ? What if I , we , are the mechanism that inadvertently provokes the incident ? Last time ... Last time , I annoyed Ben , I sent him away . As a result , he comes within a fraction of dying . What if it 's my investigations that are somehow triggering it ? We walk away , back off , the assault doesn 't happen ? You 've been part of this process since you arrived this morning . Here 's a radical thought . Let 's stop the process ! Now you 're feeling sorry for yourself . In less than two hours , a woman is gonna be savagely attacked , probably raped , bleeding to death , possibly because of me . What do I do , Christian ? Tomorrow morning there 's a report . " Woman found . Fatal wound to right external carotid artery . " Which is the bigger risk ... do something or do nothing ? That 's the nature of knowledge . There 's no way back . Gerry Mortimer . Employee at Eternity . - I met him . - He moves around a lot . I spoke to one of his previous employers . - Allegations of date rape . - Was he charged ? No . Women were drunk . He claimed it was consensual . Then why would he have had anything to do with Outcome Initiatives ? He went there with a mate , he 's shagging one of their staff , I don 't know . Gerry Mortimer , please . He 's on his break , mate . Can I help ? Do you know where he 's gone ? I 've got that money I owe him . Um ... cafe . Cardwell St. , I think . OK . Ta . He 's on a break , allegedly . Did you check Gerry Mortimer 's hand ? He works there . Why would he need a stamp ? He was bored , messing about . See if I can track him down . Late-night closing , Fridays . Maybe he 's heading to Holly 's . Whatever happens happens outside Holly 's . - Hello ? - DI Flint . I 'm inquiring about Stuart Taylor . Oh , he 's not here . I told you , if Taylor comes back , I 'll call you . - Bye . - See ya ! Where the flower was it 's yellow . If the leather is brown ... The handle appears a strange consistency . Marzipan melting in the heat . It 's a cake . A designer cake . Not a handbag . " Happy birthday , Katie " , maybe ? - The Eternity stamp ... - Was for yesterday . Cannot be seen unless it 's under ultraviolet light . Perhaps if Katie is the victim , she 's going back . Gerry Mortimer . Ben was right . Any sign of Mortimer ? No . I was wrong . He 's our man . Get to Eternity nightclub now . You changed your mind . I 'll see you later . Shit . Hello ? Callum , get yourself over to Eternity nightclub , private party . Callum ? Can you hear me , Callum ? Callum ? Hiya . Do you wanna go somewhere quiet ? - Stay away from her . - Back off , Russell . Katie 's here to see me . Aren 't you , birthday girl ? Do you think she 's special ? Think she cares about you ? One call . That 's all it took . You poor , sick bastard . Katie ... He said he wanted to talk . - We were just gonna talk . - I don 't care . I 'm so stupid ! I love you . I love you . Hold on ! What are you doing ? ! - Sorry . - I 'm off ! - I thought ... - Leave me alone ! Where are you going ? Katie ? Katie ? Katie ? Has anyone seen Katie ? Have you seen Katie ? The birthday girl . The girl whose party it is . Argh ! Russell ? Anyone seen ... Oh , shit . Ohh ... Gerry , is that you ? Not outside . Here ... in here . I don 't understand . Has anyone seen Katie ? Oh , sorry . You gave me a fright . No . No ! No ! No ! Go away . No ! Stuart Taylor , I 'm arresting you on suspicion of intent to rape . Her heel broke ! I was trying to give her her heel . There 's not enough to charge him . He was gonna rape her - worse ! The woman you allege he intended to assault said she was surprised when she saw him , as a result , became scared , she turned and ran , then tripped . Couldn 't be bothered to do the paperwork , Rob ? What did you say , she 'd be ripped to shreds in the witness box ? - She made that statement voluntarily . - What about next time ? We get DNA and put the pervert behind bars . It 's too late . For the victims , it 's too late . I thought you were on some attachment . Talisman ? Science fraud . Boring as hell . Never know where it might take us . It 's the result . The result that counts . Today , I thought I had the perfect solution . Victimless crime . You saved Katie . How many others will Stuart Taylor go on to rape ? This isn 't justice . Isn 't my job . Why do you believe you 're responsible for Stuart Taylor 's actions ? I don 't have a clue what I believe . Science . Some alien puppeteer . Who am I supposed to trust ? The MoD ? You ? Aerial shots at night ... you never did explain . You need extremely specialized and dedicated equipment . There are very few cameras capable of taking such shots . So we should be able to find out where it was taken . My earth observational satellite , Prometheus II took this image at 22 : 32 . It 's identical to the image that came down last night . What , the images aren 't just coming randomly from space ? One of them was taken directly by your own satellite ? - It appears so . - How ? I don 't know . A satellite that only you can operate , Christian ? I believed only I could operate . Then who ? Who 's doing this ? I ... I have no idea . We 've got 4.5 hours and no leads . - Why 12 images this time ? - Why seven last time ? Prometheus II is solely designed to take photos . - Who for ? - Ministry of Defense . Could they be controlling it ? - The man in the photo is dangerous . - You 're starting to freak me out . Ben ? ! It 's not him , it 's them . At 8 : 27 tonight , two people are gonna die . You 've got to call it . Subtitles modified , re-synched corrected by : M0uSe

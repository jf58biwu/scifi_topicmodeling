 Previously on Journeyman : DAN : Okay , I told the truth , that I go on these trips . Through time . Go ahead , you can say it out loud . Do I know you ? Not yet . Katie says you disappeared for a couple days - and didn 't know it ? - Something like that . And you went back in time . ( crashing ) I saw Livia . Livia 's been dead - for , like , nine years . - Hey , what are you doing here ? It is you . They found the plane in the water but not your body . - So did you even get on that plane or am I just - Yes . - talking with a ghost ? - No . We 're going to have fun . I can 't control when I go . I seem to come back to the present when I finish some chapter in the lives of the people that I 'm tracking . I don 't want to be your first phone call anymore when you have marital problems . He had an MRI . He knows it 's not that . An MRI , why ? He 's having these headaches . Did I tell you I got the results back for the MRI ? There 's nothing wrong with me . Is it something you were born with ? Is it genetic ? In the DNA ? That 's what I 'd like to know . It 's hard to say really . Whatever . Here 's the bottom line . When you 're done , the seat goes down . Again- - done ... and down . I really thought we had this licked , but recently there 's been some backslide . Change is hard , Katie . Well , it 's time to turn your back on the past and accept you share your life and your bathroom with your wife of eight years . You headed for the shower ? Mm-hmm . You want some company ? The electrician 's coming at 9 : 00 to look at the breaker panel . We can be done by 9 : 00 . Promise to put the seat down ? Promise . Then the door 's open . ( shoes clatter ) ( shower running ) Katie . Katie ! Did you say something ? Dan ? Oh . ( panting ) MAN : The palace was the last of the major buildings of the exposition to be started . Construction began December 8 , 1913 . The original column and rotunda was framed in wood . ( both grunting ) Sorry . Hey , hey , easy ! That was for taking off , all right ? ( tires screeching ) Get out of here , man . Come on . Come on . Come on . ( games beeping , chiming ) Thank you ... very much . It 's okay . Dan Vasser . Uh , Alan . Alan Pratt , hi . Uh , here , my card . Alan , please tell me I didn 't just knock down a cop and take you out of custody . Uh , what ? No . No . No , those weren 't police . I was walking down the street and , uh , one of the gentlemen asked me if I had change for the meter . The next thing I knew , they were trying to push me into their car . I literally have no idea what they wanted . You owe someone money ? No . So what do you do ? I 'm an attorney . Criminal defense , mostly DUIs and such . An angry client ? I don 't think so . Thank you . Again , very much . And , uh , I 'm in your debt . No problem . Uh , you- - you got the ... got the date ? Hey . Hey . We should go in here . Okay . Thanks . I 'm sorry you had to come all the way down here , but when I traveled back , I was just a few blocks from the paper . " Traveling , " is that what we 're calling it now ? You want to know the weird part ? It felt like I was gone for 15 minutes . When I got back , it had been three hours later . Dan , on my current list of weird that doesn 't even make the top ten . Are you okay ? Uh , I could use a minute to catch up . Katie , are you here for a job ? 'Cause I could sure use you . You couldn 't afford me . Fine , break my heart . You 're not the first . You got anything on the Capri Center ? Yeah , I got a first name and a phone number . " Julius . " Word is that he can confirm the bidding on the contract was rigged . I 've left a few messages , haven 't heard back yet . A last named be useful , don 't you think ? That would be why I 'm the reporter and you 're the editor . Funny . Watch the game last night ? Oh , God , until the sixth inning and then I had to avert my eyes . Ugly , wasn 't it ? Mm-hmm . The Giants ' hitting is out of the Book of Job . ( Katie chuckles ) I should go . What ? When I was traveling , it felt like Fall . And I saw a sign that said " Game Three Tonight . " So it was a year the Giants were in the postseason ? And there was the name of a player : Garrelts . Pitcher . Did he pitch in the Game Three in the ' 89 series ? So ? Oh , my God . ANCHORMAN : The Loma Prieta earthquake struck at 5 : 04 p.m. , just a half-hour before Game Three of the 1989 World Series . Registering 7.1 on the Richter scale , the earthquake shattered the Bay Area , killing dozens of people , toppling buildings , and starting fires across the city that burned through the night . You 're sure it was that day ? Yeah , maybe six or seven hours before the quake . ( keyboard clacking ) What are you looking for ? He 's not here . Who ? The guy who ran into me , Alan Pratt . He wasn 't killed in the earthquake . So ? Why did I meet him that day ? Charlotte Skillen ? Is that Hugh 's sister ? She was driving through the Archer Tunnel when it collapsed . I didn 't know she died in the quake . Most people don 't . He doesn 't talk about it . So do I need to worry about something big falling on you the next time you ... travel ? I 've never gone back to the same day before . 1989 . What really scares me is the chance of you seeing me when I was 16 . Hmm , yeah , the braces , right ? Huge hair- - it was a very Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally phase . ( elevator bell dings ) Have you ever ... seen anyone that you know when you 're traveling ? No . No , not yet . See you later . Bye . Hey . Welcome back . I was here last time you came . I saw that guy run into you ; what 's his name ? Alan Pratt . Hmm . I wanted to help , but you two just took off . It 's a long story . I never traveled to the same time before . Here we are on the day of the earthquake again . Why is that ? It happens . Means whatever we were supposed to do , we 're supposed to do it today . So you 've been through this before . Yes . Might be the quake , it might not . The job 's not always obvious . How long you been doing this ? Let 's just say it 's been a while . Were you traveling when we were together ? No . It stopped when I met you . Hadn 't traveled again until I left . Why didn 't you tell me , Livia ? Dan ... Listen , do you know what time it is ? My watch took one for the team . Take mine . I gave you this . When you took me , uh , for my birthday to Big Sur . That 's a loaner , by the way . I 'm gonna want that back . All right . So , you want to look for Alan Pratt ? No . I 'm going to make a phone call . What are you doing ? Trying to save some lives . OPERATOR : 911 , what 's your emergency ? I need to talk to somebody about an earthquake . Are you feeling tremors in your area , sir ? No , I ... I don 't mean now . It 's going to happen later . I don 't understand . Tonight , there 's going to be an earthquake this evening and I need to talk to someone about it . Sir , do you have an actual ... ? ( receiver slams down ) Do you really think this is what you 're here to do ? I need a listing for a city agency please . COMPUTERIZED VOICE : That number is 465-555-9342 . WOMAN : How can I help you ? Yes , I have information that strongly suggests there 's going to be a serious seismic event in the very near future . Who would I talk to about that ? Any one of several people , sir . What university are you with ? University ? Or are you with the Geological Survey , sir ? Who is this ? Think about it , Dan . If you got that call , would you believe it ? I just need to find the right person to talk to . Maybe it 's him . Traveling is about instinct . What 's yours telling you ? ( sighs ) MAN ( on TV ) : We watched the thing in the locker room . We watched that Fox pregame show ... 20 on Seattle , uh , 20 grand on New York . No way . And ten on the Bruins but only if the spread is still six points . You don 't really think I 'm going to front you $ 50,000 in bets with what you owe other people ? Look , I 'll admit I had a bad streak , but the information I had on the Seattle game is very good ... If you don 't pay some people back , you 're going to get your legs busted . You hear me ? All right , keep it at , uh , ten on the Bruins then . Get lost . Look ... Hello , Alan . ( indistinct voice on TV ) Oh . Uh ... hello . Remember how you told me you didn 't owe anybody money ? I 'm thinking was a lie . I 'm thinking you owe a lot . And those two guys this morning were here to collect . Well , it 's a complicated situation , with , uh , exigent ... Yeah . Yeah , you 're right . How much are you into the sharks for , Alan ? All told ? $ 448,072 . On sports book ? Mostly . So , we have a little monkey on our back . I guess you could say that . Me ? It was poker . One game I went down $ 46,000 in 20 minutes . I was just warming up , and then my wife called and said that she was taking my son and leaving if I didn 't come home . Not a problem for me . My wife 's already gone . ( sighs ) Here 's my point . If I can get my life back , anyone can . I 've done my time in the church basement , thank you . Boned up on the 12 steps , had a sponsor . It wasn 't so terribly helpful . Tried therapy . That didn 't work . Psychiatry , some pretty potent pharmaceuticals- - also a washout . Look ... Apparently , I 'm incorrigible . I don 't have time to argue , so ... Neither do I. You play cards . That 's wonderful . Can you direct me to a game ? $ 200 if you give me an address . Huh ? Three . Four . All right , all right . Why not ? Follow me . So , uh ... top floor , second door to the left . How do you know it 's there ? Listen , I know you 're not going to hear me when we get inside , so I 'm going to say it now- - you don 't need to go there . How much is the buy in ? It 's $ 500 . Alan , you can walk away . If you think I should walk away , why bring me here ? I don 't know . Instinct . Some guys need to hit bottom before they can get out . I 'm hoping that you 're smarter than that . Afraid not . Hey . Empty chair . You want in ? No . ( footsteps ) When I come back , I 'm hungry . Don 't ask me why . Hugh called . Wanted to know where you were . I told him you were working on the Capri Center story . - Thank you . - And Zack asked where you were . I told him you were working late . Okay . So ... where were you ? 1989 . The earthquake ? Yeah . You told me you never went back to the same day . Well , this time , I did . It 's like a dream . It 's the same day , same place , but it 's real . Dan ... what happens if you 're traveling and you die ? Do you just disappear ? Do you come back ? Do you come back dead ? I 'm not going to die . I can 't believe we 're having this conversation . ( sighs ) : So , if it feels like a dream , then maybe it 's something you 're doing to yourself . No . Katie ... The MRI didn 't find anything , but maybe it 's something else . Katie ... No , if we can just figure out what 's causing this , there 's a chance we can stop it . Katie . Katie , I 'm going back . I can feel it . There 's something that I need to do that day . What ? I don 't know . I don 't know . MAN ( over phone ) : I 'm not here . Leave a message . ( beep , Dan sighs ) Dan Vasser from the Register for Julius again . I 'm at 415-555-0177 . No word from Julius ? Not yet . ( sighs ) Think he 's getting cold feet ? Wouldn 't be the first time a source had second thoughts about talking to me . Hmm . Who 's Alan Pratt ? Oh . He 's , um ... something else I 'm working on . You were here for the ' 89 quake , right ? Weren 't you ? I was in Berlin studying abroad . I was in a bar in the Haight . Where I mostly was back then . So wasted I barely noticed the glasses falling off the shelves . Forget the earthquake . Find Julius , okay ? ( phones ringing , distant chatter ) ( horn blows ) DAN : Hey , figure out who done it ? JACK : Yeah , general belief is the shooter was the guy 's brother . I can understand that . JACK : Hey , where 's Crime Scene ? Not here yet . Find out where they are . I need your advice . You want to find out how a guy can call in a report on an earthquake and not be treated like a nut job ? Hypothetically . Who could he call that might believe him ? He 's calling in advance , predicting the earthquake ? That 's right . And you want to know this because ... ? It 's for a story I 'm working on . Well , it 's not possible . Guy makes that call is going to be treated like a nut . Yeah , but why ? Because he is a nut . But what if he knows ? He can 't . That 's the point . But what if he does ? A couple hundred people are going to die at the end of the day unless someone believes him . There must be something he can do . Dan , last time you came to me this worked up about a story , you needed 500 bucks to bail out a source . That went to a poker game in Oakland . Is that what 's really going on here ? You think I 'm gambling ? Am I asking you for money , Jack ? Not yet . Inspector , you 're going to love this . Crime Scene 's stuck in traffic . Somebody reported a suspicious package on the Dunbarton Bridge , so Bomb Squad closed it off . Cars are backed up 15 miles . Okay . I got to get back to work . Sorry I couldn 't help . ( seagulls cawing ) Actually , you did . ( computer dings ) ( phone ringing ) Dan Vasser . My name 's Julius . I got a message from you about the Capri Center ? Thanks for calling . Can you call me back ? Could we talk about this later ? I can 't be seen with a reporter . Too dangerous . Let 's talk now . That is going to be a problem . JULIUS : The hell . Why ? Listen , can you call me back ? ( sighs ) MAN : Thank you for calling the San Francisco Office of the FBI . How can I help you ? I speak for a group who opposes the ongoing criminal devastation of old growth forests in the Pacific Northwest . ( sighs ) We have planted explosive devices in tunnels and bridges around the city to draw attention to our cause . Sir , let me get the Special Agent in Charge on the phone . These devices will explode between 4 : 30 and 5 : 30 p.m. today . If you do not clear the bridges and tunnels between 4 : 00 and 4 : 30 , people will die . Do you understand ? Sir , you should speak to the special agent . So you can trace the call ? No . - Just clear the tunnels and bridges . - Sir ... You think they 're going to buy it ? ( scoffs ) One call , maybe not , but if I keep calling every 15 minutes , then , yes , I think they 'll start to take it seriously . So , you 're a terrorist now ? DAN : I 'm just trying to keep people off the roads . They clear the elevated highways and bridges , less people will die when the quake hits . Unless the roads get jammed up . Then more people die . - That 's not going to happen . - How do you know that ? I 'll tell you what I do know . You start to improvise , things get worse , not better . Do you know how many people are going to die tonight ? Why do we keep coming back to this day , this place , if we 're not meant to try to save some ? Maybe you are . Maybe you 're just not supposed to save the obvious ones . Where 's Alan Pratt ? He 's losing his money . He doesn 't need my help . He didn 't even die in the earthquake . He doesn 't need it , or you don 't want to give it ? Why would I do that ? Maybe because he reminds you of you . * She drives me crazy ... What ? Charlotte . Who ? * Like no one else Charlotte Skillen , Hugh 's sister . She must work somewhere near here . In a few hours , six tons of concrete are going to fall on her , and you cannot tell me I am not here to try and stop that from happening . ... last month 's , so , um ... Charlotte . I got most of it covered , but , uh , I 'm about 500 short . Now , I could get it back at the end of the week . Don 't hang ... Don 't ... hang up . Hello . Oh . You 're just the man I was hoping to find . That , uh , money I gave you to get me into the game- - um , I need it back . Purely a loan . I 'm good for it . You bust already ? How bad a card player are you , Alan ? I just need a stake to get me back in the game . They 're going to give away my seat if I don 't get right back , - so , please give me the money . - No . I-I don 't want this to become unpleasant . It 's pretty unpleasant already , Alan . I know . I must seem pathetic to you . Actually , it 's like looking in an old mirror . ALAN : I need the money . Give it to me . - I can 't do this now . - I don 't care . I won 't go until you give me the money , I mean it . You 're the one who got me into the game in the first place . No , you 're right , I did . You want the money ? Take it . Didn 't change anything . Hey , I got a question . What ? It 's about Charlotte . Charlotte who ? Your sister . Do you , do you remember where she was right before the earthquake ? What is this about ? I was thinking about doing a feature on the earthquake . The anniversary 's next week and ... Yeah , the 18th anniversary . We 're not gonna do squat . Save it for the 20th . Everybody 's gonna do the 20th . We should do a story now . You got the Capri Center for me ? It 'll be locked down in a couple of days . No , you 'll have it tomorrow . And then you can talk to me about a feature . If I wait I won 't have time to put the earthquake story together . Even assuming I wanted to do the story , why are you interested in my sister ? I just don 't want to do a usual boring anniversary story . I want to make it personal . Write about people I have a connection to who were in the quake . Katie , my brother maybe . And Charlotte . Where was she that afternoon ? Forget it . No , no , no ... No , I said drop it . The Capri Center . Tomorrow . No joke , Dan . Hello ? Hey , I need a favor . What ? I 'm expecting a call from a source named " Julius . " If he calls , can you get a time that I can call him back ? I 'm forwarding my cell number to your phone . This is the guy who knows about the rigged bids at the Center ? Yeah , it 's pretty important that I talk to him today . How important ? Well , I may not have a job if I don 't . Okay . WOMAN : Keller and Dane Advertising , can you hold please ? Keller and Dane , can you hold please ? Yes , can I help you ? Hi ! Dan Vasser ? Hi , I 'm Charlotte Skillen . Hello . ( giggling ) Your picture doesn 't do you justice . Yeah , well , thank you . I think . Who , who showed you my picture ? Uh , Hugh . Oh , you know my little brother ? Yeah . How ? You one of his drinking buddies ? No , no , no , I don 't , I don 't drink with him . Oh , well , good , I wish a few more people were like you . He really needs to slow down . But when I tell him , he just gets mad . He 'll work it out for himself eventually . Thank you , ladies . Um , you know , no offense , but , uh , you are a little more mature than most of my brother 's friends . You mean older . And don 't think he doesn 't point that out to me all the time . Oh . Anyway I , I work for a chain of restaurants in the Central Coast Mm-hmm . and we could use some advertising . And , um , Hugh tells me that you do great work . So , um ... Well , great , let 's set a meeting . Well , it has to be today . Uh , what are you doing in about , um , 45 minutes ? I 'm sorry ? How about a drink ? Say 4 : 30 . I 'd like to do it today . Hugh set this up , right ? What ? I get it . I get it- - he , uh , he sent you to ask me out . No , no . It 's not the first time he 's done it . He probably gave you that lame line about how I do great work , right ? You 've seen right through me . Oh , I knew it . I 'm gonna kill my little brother . Well , now that the cards are out on the table- - how about that drink ? Oh , yeah , I , I 'm flattered , really , but no . Why not ? Because it 's ... weird . Look . I should have told you the truth . But if I go back to Hugh and tell him that I screwed this all up I 'm never gonna hear the end of it . Oh , yeah , I don 't know . It 's half an hour . Meet me at 4 : 30 at the restaurant across the street . It 'll be painless , I promise . And then neither of us will have to endure your brother 's hectoring . Eh . Okay . If it 'll keep the Hulk off your back . The Hulk ? Oh , yeah , it 's a family name for Hugh . Shh , don 't let him know I told you about it . Okay . Only if you meet me at 4 : 30 . Okay , 4 : 30 . Great . ( phone ringing ) Hello ? I 'm looking for Dan Vasser . My name 's Julius . Oh , hi , hi . Yeah , this is his wife . He 's not here right now . Listen , where exactly does your husband go ? He 's never there . If you 'll tell me a time when he can call you ... I don 't like this back and forth . Tell him I said forget it . He can find somebody else . Wait a minute . No , don 't hang up , okay ? Don 't , uh ... Listen , this story is very important to Dan . And I know it 's important to you , too , or else you wouldn 't have called him , right ? Hello ? Look , I 'm taking a chance every time I get on the phone . Of course you are . Look , I ... I used to be a reporter , I worked with confidential sources . I understand the worry . It 's , it 's ... worrying . Where were you a reporter ? On Channel Six . I was Katherine Barron then . I remember you . You know , that 's always nice to hear . Why don 't you and I talk ? Just for a minute . And then later you can talk to Dan or not , it 's up to you . I guess that 'd be okay . Great . Uh ... okay , um , I 'll need your full name . Horvath . Julius Horvath . Okay , Mr. Horvath . You hate fern bars . Going soft on me ? It 's convenient . I need that stool in a couple of minutes . Ooh , who 's the lucky girl ? Charlotte . You need any help with her ? Nope . I just need to keep her here for a half-hour . And get through the quake , she can go on her way . Oh , you really got her in your sights . What 'd you do to get her here , you work your masculine wiles ? Little bit . Is that why you took your ring off ? Yeah , don 't tell Katie . Katie ? Yeah . Jack 's Katie ? That 's right . ( softly exhales ) I 'm sorry . I was ... I was waiting for the right moment to tell you . How long was it after I left ? Can we talk about this another time ? No , I want to know . Did this happen right away ? You were dead . At least I thought you were . And Katie was there for me when nobody else was and then ... Hi . Um , I think I should go . Charlotte . Clearly in the middle of something very complicated here . No , I 'm not blind . Wait , please . This is important . Please let go of me . You don 't understand . You need to stay . Ow ! You 're hurting me . She said let go . It 's none of your business , all right . She said let go . Charlotte . Charlotte ! Wait . No . Wait ! I don 't think so . Charlotte , wait ! Charlotte ! Charlotte ! ( grunting ) Dan Vasser . Hey , uh , Julius called . He gave me an interview . He says the , uh , bidding for the Capri Center construction contract was rigged . He gave me names , dates . Great . Can you e-mail me the notes ? Yeah , I 'll have to type them up first . Get them to me as soon as you can . ( phone beeps ) Okay , oh . There 's another call coming in . Hey , does the girl still have it ? Yes , she does . Bye . Hello . Katie . Jack . How are you ? Great . Really great . Is something up ? How do you feel about lunch ? Dan 's in trouble , Katie . And if he is , you are , too . We 're fine , but thanks for your concern . He came to me asking how to warn people about an earthquake . I mean , come on , if that 's not nuts I don 't know what is . And you and I both know that when Dan starts talking crazy , something else is going on . It 's for a story he 's working on . Right , well , that 's exactly what he told me . Yeah , maybe ' cause it 's true . Yeah , well , the disappearances ? And the stories ? I think it 's a cover . I think maybe he 's back at the tables . He 's not . Well ... if he 's in that place again , it 's gonna get worse fast . Can we just have lunch ? Hmm . Did he tell you he saw Livia ? I mean , it 's interesting , don 't you think that ... whatever he 's doing takes him right back to her . Unless he didn 't tell you . Jack , stop . I guess he didn 't tell you . You said you shouldn 't be my first phone call anymore . That was smart . Let 's stay smart , okay ? Handsome Dan . What 's up ? When you were covering the courthouse , did you ev come across a lawyer named Alan Pratt ? Pratt . We 're talkin ' late ' 80s , right ? Kinda looked like a Young Republican ? Had a taste for the ponies ? More than a taste . Sure I remember him . Low-level guy . Small fish . Any idea what happened to him ? I can 't find any record after the earthquake in ' 89 . He owed a lot of money to the wrong people . Basically on the skid , if you know what I mean . I guess he bottomed out , 'cause two or three days after the quake , he checked into a motel in San Jose , ate the barrel of a .45 . Can I ask why you care ? I couldn 't even get this in the paper back then , what with all the coverage the earthquake got . What are you doing ? Trying to get to ' 89 . I 've been trying for a couple of hours now , but wanting it doesn 't seem to help . You seem pretty anxious about it . - I know what I have to do . - What ? Pull a guy out of a card game , which is ironic 'cause I put him there . I don 't , um , I don 't understand . Why-Why is that so important to you ? 'Cause it 's what I can do . Nothing else has worked . I couldn 't warn people , I ... couldn 't save Charlotte . So if this is my job , I just want to do it . Did you get my notes for the Capri Center story ? Yeah , I did , thank you , they 're ... I wrote them up , they were a big help . I 'm glad . I had lunch with Jack today . Hey ! Hey , what are you doing ? Taking you with me . Come on . No ! No ! What are you doing ? I 'm winning . How much , huh ? A thousand ? $ 10,000 ? You owe half a million , Alan . You gonna pay that back winning $ 500 pots ? I know you . You want to lose , lose everything . You 'll be able to do it , be able to pull the trigger . I bet you 've already bought the gun . Why not , huh ? I 'm a dead man as it is . No , you 're not , Alan . Yes , I am . I 'm dead . I can 't change , I can 't shake this thing and put this life behind me- - nothing works . Nothing . Works . I 'm going back . No , no ! ( car alarms blaring ) Alan ! Alan ! Alan ! ( Alan grunting ) Alan , can you hear me ? In here . Alan ! Can you hear me ? Alan . No ... don 't leave . I 'm not . Take it easy . Can you breathe ? Not so good . What ? I 'm alive . I 'm alive . Yes . Yes , you are . You okay ? Yeah . You were right . It wasn 't about saving someone from the earthquake . It was about getting Alan Pratt into it . Because the only way he was going to change was having a house fall down on him . Is that what happened to you ? A house fell on you ? I realized if I kept going , I 'd lose Katie . So ... Katie . Yeah . I wanted to tell you about my traveling when we met , but it hadn 't happened for a while and I thought maybe it wouldn 't happen again , that I was going to stay . Which felt good ... because I was happy where I was . It 's okay . Are you happy where you are ? With Katie ? Yeah . Yeah , I am . Then , congratulations . TV ANNOUNCER : Since founding the National Justice Project in 1991 , attorney Alan Pratt has overturned the convictions of dozens of innocent prisoners , including three who were on death row . My job , basically , is to help the hopeless , help them any way I can , because ... hopelessness is something I know a little about . It all started in my bedroom . Now we have an office and a support staff and ... Hey , any idea where Hugh is ? Did you get the Capri Center story ? Yep . First-rate . What you doing ? Thinking about anniversaries . The earthquake ? Charlotte ? Among others . Tell me about Charlotte . Come on . I mean , I 've known you 12 years and all I know about your sister is her name and how she died . How about that she was supposed to come see me that day ? The day of the earthquake . That 's right . But we had a fight that morning about ... booze . And I told her to go to hell , and she went home instead , ended up in the Asher tunnel . Because you were drinking . That 's right . Drank all night , drank all morning , drank until our mother called to tell me what had happened . That 's when I stopped . Funny thing happened to me . I found myself in a poker game . I was this close to sitting down . I mean , I could taste it . You and me , Hugh , we were ... lucky . We got our lives back . We need to hang on . I 'm trying . Now tell me about Charlotte . And don 't tell me what you did or how guilty you feel . Come on , Hulk . Oh , I haven 't been called that in a long while . How do you know she called me that ? Lucky guess . Tell me about her . What do you want to know ? Katie ? Katie , where are you ? Katie ? Katie ? Everything okay ? You left your jacket . I don 't understand . You left your jacket behind . I found this in the pocket . Where is she , Dan ? Where 's Livia ?

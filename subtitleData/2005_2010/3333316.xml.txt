 in the future , a computer program called skynet will declare war on the human race . machines have traveled back in time , taking human form to terminate john connor , the future leader of the resistance ; sarah connor , john 's mother , teacher , and protector ; cameron , a terminator reprogrammed to defend them at all costs ; derek reese , john 's uncle , and the commanding officer with the resistance . together they fight to stop skynet from ever being created . the battle for our tomorrow starts today . previously on terminator : the sarah connor chronicles ... whatever happened with the explosion flipped a switch . you don 't know what you 're about to do . you 're gonna kill me . i love you , please . i love you , john , and you love me . maybe you could fix her , but i can 't let you . i 'm sorry . i 'm looking for the connors . sarah connor ? mr. dixon wanted to marry sarah connor before you . maybe he 's hiding her here . if one of them follows you here , you 'll have killed us . you died two years ago . it was cancer . you died . did you sleep ? what do you do with a guard dog you can 't trust ? what , that one ? i 'd have spent the night talking to him . yeah , i think she 's outside his jurisdiction . just a wire knocked loose , or something . so he says . bitch is nothing but wire . it 's only a matter of time . it 's healing quickly . quicker than yours . what about the rest of you ? you 're back to normal ? things have changed , john . what things ? you can 't be trusted anymore . me ? i can 't be trusted anymore ? you risked your life to fix me . that was a very dangerous thing to do . that could upset people . they 'll have to deal with it . not them . what did she say ? nothing . you should go to school . i 'll start on a new place . school ? really ? you always talk about how english is so boring . i think we could all use boring today , especially you . what about her ? last thing she is is boring . i 'll keep her with us . so , um , you 've been sitting in the same exact spot since you bailed out on english . i figure it must have some kind of redeeming value . you 're in mr. hendrickson 's class , right ? um , it 's mr. amidon 's class , weirdo . and , yeah , i 'm third row , second from the left . right . and your name is ? it 's riley . way to flatter a girl . look , riley , i really , uh- - i don 't mean to be rude . oh , wait , let me guess , you are just way too busy for company right now . obviously . don 't you have somewhere to be ? don 't you ? hey , um , you got 20 bucks ? yeah. why ? i 'm still hungry . there 's three bedrooms . four if you count the nursery , and why wouldn 't you ? this one here 's the master suite . i 'll check the electric . so you live next door ? mm-hmm . where 'd the owners go ? oh , they 're in tokyo for a year . bob 's a last-minute fill-in for his boss . guy stroked out three days before he was supposed to leave . don 't feel bad . i met the guy once , and he grabbed my ass with his wife five feet away . not this ass , of course . eh , you- - car accident . oh . the whole family . teaching that one to drive . you 're kidding me . i don 't kid about teenagers . i can 't even imagine . how many months are you ? seven . i feel like a whale . you look great . i 'm an orca with boobs . there are worse things to be . do you want to feel it ? it 's cool . everyone does . it 's crazy , right ? once upon a time , you were inside her . we can move in today . oh , yeah , as soon as i figure out what to do with all this stuff . we 'll take it , all of it . mrs. dixon . i 'm james ellison , fbi . may i come in ? i 'm not here as an fbi agent . i 'm here to help you . i found it in a drawer this morning after he went to work . charlie hates guns . mich , i 'm home . what 's going on here ? we need to talk . help ! check the perimeter . come on , help . greenway . what ? what ? what are you trying to say ? who ? stop greenway . who 's greenway ? stop- - who 's greenway ? hey . serrano point . the power plant , serrano point . two days . two days what ? wait , hey ! no , no , no . hey . he 's from the future . sent here by john . i assume that 's how he found us . you sure that 's not broken ? i 'm sure i don 't care . you heard the guy . serrano point , two days , stop greenway . i 'll handle it . i 've seen how you handle it . i send you and a land mine to do this , i guarantee someone 's ending up dead . maybe somebody 's supposed to end up dead . and the other part of that equation is maybe not . are you coming ? it looks a lot different than i remember . in the future , the resistance controls this plant ? the battle of avila beach . december 8 , 2026 . humans regain control of serrano point from skynet . it 's a key strategic hold . it 's one of our main sources of power . the guy who died said something about two days . what 's happening in two days ? maybe greenway will tell us . maybe greenway 's trying to sabotage the plant . you think he 'll tell us that ? i think he will . all right . okay . nuclear power plants supply 20 % of the nation 's electricity . but how do they work ? these lovely ladies are uranium fuel rods . and they are hot . we 're gonna start a chain reaction . aww , nuts . hot rods make the water boil . the steam spins turbines , and abracadabra , energy . of course we can 't forget to cool the steam back to water so the whole process can be repeated . or else we 'll have a massive compromise of the containment system . you know , i don 't like taking on new temps , i will tell you . still , perfect score on your placement exam . security clearance . and i did have two janitors call in with some personal emergencies , so ... come on . is there a reason you two are so rough around the edges ? car accident . 'cause i can 't have any problems in my plant . car accident . just stay out of the fuel building without your protective gear on . or you could get crapped up . that doesn 't sound very pleasant . it 's plant talk for getting exposed to radiation . then you 'd need a scrub down . you don 't want a scrub down . sarah 's alive ? in l.a. ? and these things , they 're not human ? i can 't- - i can 't- - i don 't love her anymore , babe . not like that . of all the things you just told me , charley , she seems to be the least of our problems . you two need to leave this place . it 's not safe here anymore . where is ? saint bibiana . saint who ? saint bibiana . it 's the school that i went to until ninth grade . well , ninth and a half , technically . 'cause i got the boot for this . can you believe it ? so what 's your story ? you look a little- - oh , it 's just a car accident . i was teaching my sister how to drive . did everyone check out ? check out ? is everyone okay ? oh , yeah , we 're fine . we 're good . we 're alive . for now . you 're full of carrots and apples . carrots and apples ? yeah , carrots and apples . you know , happy thoughts . i don 't think that 's really an expression . it 's not ? i don 't know , maybe if you 're on a farm . we 're moving . my mom found us a new place this morning . is it nice ? i don 't know . i haven 't seen it . are you serious ? she hasn 't , like , shown you any pictures or anything ? she 's not really the picture type . yeah , i totally know that type . so you wanna come see it ? what , the mystery house ? yeah , the mystery house . do you wanna come with me and see it ? check the cooling pump calibration on the p.w.r. board . it was fine yesterday . we 're less than 36 hours from going online . check it again . i 'd have a headache too if i had to figure out what all those buttons do . they 're just vitamins . i 'm karen , by the way . carl . you 're new ? brand spanking . just moved here from texas . really ? whereabouts ? a little town called elgin . near corpus christi . i was stationed at ingleside naval base . oh , imagine that . neighbors and never even knew it . i hear there 's a big test tomorrow . the reactor 's going back online ? exactly how 's that work ? hopefully perfectly . greenway . a word . nice meeting you , karen . likewise . there 's cautious , and there 's just plain paranoid , okay ? we 're going online . sure as hell not gonna let you stall us . well , i guess this is it . sweet . what 's the matter ? never brought a girl home before ? no . well , i wonder where your room is . i don 't know . well , let 's go look for it . she can 't be serious . one more , please . i 'll have what he 's having . i 'm drinking tonic water . i won 't have what he 's having . i waitressed for years . on our break , the other girls would smoke and i would , um- - play with matches . study for my computer classes . see how far it got me . so what 's your story , carl ? how do you end up at serrano point ? started off in the navy . served 12 years on a nuclear sub . every girl loves a uniform . my ex didn 't . at least not the one with my name stitched to it . bitch . affirmative . that 's a good scar . got a good story to go with it ? i don 't know about good , but it 's a story . hi . i 'm cindy . i 'm new in town . this looks like fun . well , cindy , this may look like fun , but bob here 's got 50 bucks says he can beat anyone in this bar . ain 't that right , bob ? i 'll play you , bob . you ever played this game before ? how hard could it be ? oh , it 's plenty hard , girl . let me show you . now , what you 're gonna do is take this stick and lean over the table . now slide it through your fingers . relax , and get a real good feel . that 's right . still my shot . right , bob ? so the first surgery , they went in , took out most of the lymph nodes . then they went back in four months ago and cleaned out the rest . luckily , they were able to go through the same incision . you don 't hear many people with cancer use the word " luckily . " oh , you 'd be surprised . after four rounds of chemo , you say a lot of things you never thought you would . most of them i won 't repeat . now i 've gone and spooked you . no . yeah . it 's okay . you wouldn 't be the only one . in a nuke plant , guy with cancer is sort of a black cat . funny thing is 20 years around nuclear reactors , i haven 't been crapped up , not once . lucky . see , lucky . there you go . you seem like a good guy , carl . if no one will drink with you 'cause you 're sick , then it 's their loss . that isn 't why they won 't drink with me . somebody just smashed greenway 's windshield . big guy with a crew cut . well , greenway 's got a lot of enemies . he stopped the last reactor test because of safety concerns . if he stops the test tomorrow , people are afraid the plant will get shut down and they 'll lose their jobs . he 's concerned about one of the sensor boards in the control room . it 's showing slight irregularities in the coolant pumps . i hacked into the computer and read his notes . anyway , his boss is pressuring him to ignore it , says it 's nothing major . but if greenway 's , right , and there was a problem- - the reactor could melt down . half the state would be contaminated . skynet wins . but if greenway stops the test and they close down the plant ... then the resistance can 't use it in the future . skynet wins . wow , they didn 't even leave any pickles . check the freezer . oh , my god , you 're a genius . how did you know ? what 's wrong ? it 's my mom . is that a problem ? john ? who are you ? this is riley . from school . hi , mom . let 's talk , you and i . riley from school . you never mentioned her before . well , that 's because i just met her today . really ?

hey . look at the stars . what are you doing in here ? this is a restricted area . i 'm looking for the supply room . one of the lifts in the waste barrel area leaked hydraulic fluid . you might as well take care of it since you 're here . suit up . it can get nasty in there . what is that ? what does that mean ? i means you just got crapped up . morning . did you sleep on the floor ? early riser . what 's that ? what 's it look like ? looks like a robot . it 's a robot , big scary man , whatever . he 's for you . to protect you while you sleep . what , do i look like i need protection ? if you don 't want it then- - no , no . it 's very cool . thank you . you 're very welcome . so i guess i 'm gonna try to make it to english . what about you ? maybe ... not today . can i call you sometime ? this is gonna sound really weird , but whenever you call me the first words out of your mouth need to be the date . day first , then the month , okay ? and i 'm doing this because ? because you want to call me , and that 's just the way it is . see you later then . these are my same clothes . aren 't they crapped up ? you know , it turns out they 're not . positive reading must have been a hiccup . a hiccup ? yeah , sometimes these scanners have a mind of their own . agent ellison . wanted to make sure you got off all right . well , all right 's pretty relative , isn 't it ? how 's she doing ? well , you know , we always thought we 'd raise kids in this house . but you just can 't plan for anything now , can you ? for the road . so what about you , are you gonna leave ? or does god have a plan for you ? we 'll see . yeah , we 'll see . thank you . good luck . t minus two minutes . coolant system numbers are within tolerances . of course they are . everything is fine . but yesterday you said- - everything is fine . 16 november . 20 : 07 . something 's wrong with greenway . are you at his house ? yeah , i 'm searching now . sarah , is greenway there ? are you telling me that he 's there ? he 's here . 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . and we 're online . greenway , he 's been replaced by a machine . did you hear me ? greenway has control of the plant , and he 's a machine . you alive in there ? i 'm thinking about what to do . since when did you do that ? what 's going on ? turbine building . water valve 's sprung a leak . go fix it . where the hell did you go ? something 's wrong . we need to turn on the water pumps . we gotta cool it down . everything is fine . carl , the reactor 's overheating . it 's going to melt down . please remain calm . you need to talk to greenway . he 's lost his mind . what the- - code red . all employees must evacuate immediately . he 's unconscious . the reactor 's overheating . emergency manual . there 's no way . water tank leak . no , there 's no time . we gotta go . i found the instructions . sarah , come on now ! let 's go ! no , no , no . this is some kind of schematic . nrc emergency . security code , please . i 'm in the control room . we need help . sir , i need a security code . this is an emergency . we don 't know what we 're doing . sir , i 'm sorry but- - sarah ! sir ?

i don 't know . is today how it happens ? i don 't know . what am i supposed to do , just wait ? like a time bomb , am i just gonna go off someday ? i don 't know . am i ? you have a new friend . her name is riley . and you probably creeped her out . when you talk to people , don 't stand so close . i was assessing her threat level . well ? am i safe ? i don 't know . girls are complicated . about what you said before , about not being able to trust me . yes ? i don 't have to prove anything to anyone . anyone . including you . 16 november . hey , you got it right . what 's up ? just practicing . because of this tragic incident , the owners of serrano point and six other power plants across the nation are entering into a partnership with my corporation , automyte systems . new automated technology we 've developed will be implemented in all control rooms . these sophisticated machines will eliminate the possibility of human error and prevent a major disaster .

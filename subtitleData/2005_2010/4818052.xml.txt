Yes . They 've strengthened security for the concert . Rouge is in there ? Yes . We 've got no other choice . We 'll have to force our way in . We can 't . If you cause an uproar here ... Such trifles are easily handled by royal power . impress upon them the might of the royal family . Jiiya . Clear the path ! Who do you think this personage is ? Her Royal Highness Flora Skybloom ! Bow your heads ! I 'm afraid we can 't let even the royal family in . Wh-What ? I-In that case ... What do you think of this ? ! Th-That ... Could it be ... ? The Number Seven Platinum member card ! One moment ! Yes ... Yes ! You 're approved . pass . A fan club membership treated with more awe than proof of royalty ... It 's the end of the world . let 's go in . princess . I don 't mind . I 'm glad I was able to help him along . Jiiya ! You 've become strong ... Are you sure ? Letting fugitives into the stadium ... Let me do as I please . sir ... I am entrusted with complete authority over the concert . I take full responsibility . Sir . It 's all proceeding as planned . where are you ? Where are you ? Rouge ! Rouge ! huh ? Doing well ?

They waved us right through . Princess Flora . Everybody 's figured it out . though ... Why worry about it ? that 's the important thing . Though it went so smoothly that it 's kinda creepy . did you see Rouge ? Did something happen ? Shut up ! Something 's rubbed him the wrong way ! Maybe Rouge dumped him ! She looked right at me and asked who I was . And what the hell is this supposed to mean ? { sz : sign appears to read " tespas cap " : / ... trespass something ? } Crash the party ... I dare you " ? but I don 't get it ! No worries . The Bigfoots are primed and ready to go . That can 't mean ... she wants us to crash the concert ? For real ? Sounds like fun !

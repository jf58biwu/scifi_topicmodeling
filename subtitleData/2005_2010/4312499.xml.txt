 Previously on Heroes : I 'll only be gone for a while . This is your chance at a normal life . - Welcome to New Orleans . - Is that pay-per-view ? Micah 's some type of genius and rigged the cable . I 'll take everything you got in the register ! You don 't realise how valued you are here at the company . - You 're part of the family now . - I 'm in over my head . As long as I 'm alive , you will be taken care of . - Peter ! - This is all you had when we found you . Your box or your life . You gonna open it ? Hiro Nakamura , murdered . Angela Petrelli , attacked . This is my dad . He may be the killer . - I 'll find your father . - What 's the apartment number ? - Nine . - Nine . Good girl . - Get out of there now . - He sees me . Leave me alone ! Molly , please wake up . When confronted by our worst nightmares , Fight or flight . We hope to find the strength to stand against our fears . But sometimes , despite ourselves , we run . What if the nightmare gives chase ? Where can we hide then ? - When 's she gonna wake up ? - I don 't know , she 's burning up . - We gotta get her to a hospital . - No hospital 's equipped for this . You really think my father did this to her , in her nightmare ? She used her ability to find him for you , and slipped into this . She was so afraid . I never should have asked her to look for him . No , you shouldn 't have . - Now you know where he is . - I can 't leave her like this . You have to . If your father did something to her , you need to find out what and how to end it . You have an address in Philadelphia . She even saw his door . I haven 't seen the man in 25 years . Molly faced her worst nightmare for you . Do the same for her . Find him . I 'll stay here . I 'll do everything I can . I don 't even know what I 'm dealing with . Why was he in that photo ? Angela Petrelli she knows him . You 're gonna be OK . I promise . I was about to lock up when this guy showed up . He ... He pushed his way in , shoved a gun in my face . Next thing I know he 's flying through that glass . You hit an armed man ? I guess . Could 've been a kick . I don 't know , it all happened so fast . Is this the guy ? His name is Lonny Stills . He 's a local gangbanger . He 's already hit three other fast food joints in the area this month . - It fits his MO . - Like I said , it 's all a blur . Look , I know you don 't want to be a snitch . It 's dangerous . But for me to get this guy off the street , I need somebody to step up and ID him , be a hero . I 'm sorry , I can 't do that . I can 't help a neighbourhood that won 't help itself . You change your mind , you give me a call . You closing up already ? It 's the middle of the afternoon . I need a break . I could get used to this . Right , a guy who can throw 1.000 volts out of either hand settling for everyday life in a pub in Cork . I 'm not sure it suits you . Why not ? Peter , just because you don 't remember your past , it doesn 't mean you don 't have one . Aren 't you curious about who you are , where you come from ? You 've seen what I can do . There 's a side of me I can 't control . Maybe it 's best if I don 't dig too deep . I know the kind of man you are . Even if you don 't . There 's only good in you . And I bet whatever 's in that box will tell you the same thing . Weren 't you the one who didn 't want me to look in that box ? I only said that because you hadn 't kissed me yet . Now that you have , you done with me ? Mm ... Gettin ' there . After all , a pretty boy like you , there 's bound to be someone looking for you . Friends . A girlfriend . Let ' em look . Like I told you , you 're not gonna find him in there . But you 're sure it was him ? Yeah . Found him cuffed inside there a few nights back . Poor sap . Didn 't know how he got there . - Didn 't even know his own name . - Do you know where he is now ? Depends . Who 's askin ' ? Just me . I work for a company interested in keeping him out of trouble . Peter is a ... dangerous guy . Ha . You don 't have to tell me that . He 's in town . Place called Wandering Rocks Pub . Hey , if he 's so dangerous , sweetheart , why 'd they send a little girl like you in all alone ? I can take care of myself . Bring her back to holding . What are you doing interrogating my mother without me ? Relax . She didn 't give me anything . Of course she didn 't . These people protect each other . My mother 's not a killer . I won 't have her sit in jail for a crime she didn 't commit . Neither am I. That 's why I 'm going to Philadelphia to see my father , figure this whole thing out . - Let me come with you . - No ! You 're not a cop . I 'm guessing this isn 't official police business . If I 'm there , it won 't make a difference . - Officially , neither are you . - You don 't understand . It 's Molly . - My father did something to her . - " Did something to her " ? Come here . - Did what ? - He got inside her head somehow . I don 't know how , but I think it 's all connected . To Kaito . To your mother . It could be dangerous . I can take care of myself . Listen , I have to do this . Let me come with you . Fine . We can probably get there faster . You know , ' cause you can , uh ... - I 'm not a cargo jet , Parkman . - Oh , please . I need to talk to him . Alone . Tell him what you told me . This American girl , she 's hitting all the boys on the dock , looking for a certain shipping container . - She say what she wanted ? - Yeah . You . No worries , boyo . I think I can help . This is my problem . Not given what I just saw between you and my sister . You care about her , don 't you ? Right now , she 's the only thing in my life that means something . Caitlin has a flat up the hill . Go there and stay until I call you . I 'll take care of your friend . I could handle this myself . I don 't doubt it . I 've seen what you can do . But I 've got an investment in you now . Some little blonde isn 't going to scare me off . Now go on . And don 't be telling Caitlin about any of this . She 'll only worry sick . Monica . - Well ? - Well , what ? Are you gonna tell me what that was all about ? Uh , I just didn 't want some crackhead looking for revenge . - So I said I didn 't recognise him . - Not that . The whole flying karate kick thing . Oh ... that . Mr Lamont said he had never seen anything like it . How did you do that ? More importantly , why did you do that ? I don 't know . I don 't know anything anymore . Nothing makes any sense . Well ... where did you learn how to ... I think ... I think on TV . Something is happening to me , Camille . My body does things before my brain even knows what 's happening . That thing with the tomatoes yesterday . Now this . It 's like ... Like what ? I was supposed to be somebody , Camille . The first person in my family to go to college . Now look at me . Never mind . I 've been here since last night . I 'm gonna go home and sleep it off . Hey , Monica . Everything 's gonna be OK . Oh . OK ? Yeah . I hope so . This is it . This is where Molly said we 'd find him . What are you planning , exactly ? - I 'm not sure . - You 're not sure ? He traumatised your girl . Has my mother terrified . Get sure . Get your gun out . Come on . Hey ... You OK ? When I was 13 , my father ran out on us . I haven 't talked to him . I haven 't seen him . I 've spent half my life thinking about what I 'm gonna say to this guy . And now I can 't even knock on the door . You 're welcome . Parkman , this is not a family reunion . - I know . - OK . He 's not your dad today . He is a suspect . Get your gun out . Police ! Open up ! Who the hell are you ? ! I said who the hell are you ? - Put the gun down and I 'll tell you . - Parkman . Matt ? Oh , my God . W - What are you doing here ? Put the gun down . Not till you tell me what you 're doing here ! I want to know what you 're doing inside Molly Walker 's dreams . What do you know about Kaito Nakamura 's murder ? And why is Angela Petrelli protecting you ? Aah ! Ow ! Wait ! What are you , a cop ? Aah ! Right now I 'm not . You better start talking . I 'm good . Ow ! You got it all wrong . - That why you 're swingin ' a shotgun ? - Because of that . On ... On the desk . They 're gonna kill me too . Tell me about Molly Walker . She 's seen this symbol , seen you , - calls you the nightmare man . - She 's looking for me . And now she won 't wake up . So whatever you did , undo it now . Sorry , I 'm protecting myself . - Protecting yourself from who ? - Which one of her kids are you ? You 're the politician , right ? My mother is sitting in jail for Kaito 's murder . They both received similar threats . Both taken from the same picture . The same photograph . You were all connected . Your folks , Kaito , Linderman , me ... We found each other years ago . We thought we could help people . Save the world . Oh ! The only thing you 've ever wanted to save is your own ass . Still angry , huh , Matt ? Feel better ? - Slapping the cuffs on your dad ? - Oh , it 's starting to , yeah . This is a waste of time . Just read his mind so we can get the hell out of here . What did you say ? You can ... read minds ? Yeah ? Go ahead . Go on . Aah ... God ! - It 's painful , isn 't it ? - How do you know that ? Can you read minds too ? See , Matt , you and I , we 're not so different after all . Come on , unlock these cuffs . I 'll tell you everything I know . I promise . Isn 't it wonderful ? We 've got a musician in the house again . Nobody 's touched that thing since my mother died . Oh , I 'm sorry . Nana said I could , but if ... Oh , yeah . It 's OK . Please keep playing . You must really miss your mom . Yeah , I do . I miss mine too . Oh , I 'm sure she 's fine . And missing you right back . She wouldn 't even tell me where she was going . You gotta remember she cares about you . I know new things can be scary . My mom always said God doesn 't give us anything we can 't handle . You play piano too ? No . Never learned . If you don 't play , then what was that ? Yes ? I 've tried to reach you for hours . Where have you been ? - I 'm at work . Why ? - Molly won 't wake up . Her vitals are getting worse . I 'm running out of options . - Take her to the hospital . - And say what , she 's trapped in a nightmare ? No , I am taking her into the company . You can 't be serious . These are the people we 're fighting against . Molly won 't last . They are the only people who can understand . Don 't do this . The moment you trust them with what you care about most , they 'll have you . Don 't forget whose side you 're on . I 'm on her side . All right , you gotta tell us everything . Everyone you 've ever worked with . - Everything . - I 'm so sorry I left you . It wasn 't easy for me . - Don 't . - I need to say it . When I found out I could read minds , it was a temptation , I was weak . I used people . I was a real scumbag . You a cop . I 'm so proud . You don 't get to be proud . Just answer the questions . You said you tried to save the world . How ? These gifts came out of nowhere . We just found each other , like we were connected somehow . Thought we were invincible . A few of us took that to heart . They started to do what they wanted . I did what I could to stop them . - Like what ? - This thing we can do , you and I. It only begins at reading minds and then it becomes so much more . More how ? I ... I can 't explain it . No , hang on . I got something I can show you , 'cause it helped me understand it . Yeah , I got a bunch of stuff from back then . It 's ... It 's in here . Oh , come on . Matt ? Matt ! Dad ? Hey , what 's going on ? Hey , what the hell 's going on ? Where am I ? This is impossible . We saved the city . Let me out ! It 's a mistake . I 'm not supposed to be here . Yeah , no one 's supposed to be here . Pleasant dreams . Whoa . Monica . I think I know what happened with the piano . What can I say ? Guess I 'm just a musical genius . Or it 's something else . Look , it 's been a hard couple days for me . In fact , it 's been a hard couple years . So I think I 'm just gonna take a nice , long nap and sleep it off . Monica . Do you remember last night when I said I was able - to rig the pay-per-view on the TV ? - Yeah . ... the rebuilding of downtown New Orleans is in full swing . People are returning , and looking for a fresh start . Restaurants , retail ... Well , I lied . How did ? How did you ? I think it runs in the family . I mean , maybe not exactly like me , but ... - My dad could walk through walls . - DL ? Yeah . And my mom ... Don 't even get me started on my mom . But I think what 's going on with you is more like this . - A comic book ? - Yeah . This is Saint Joan . - She 's a muscle mimic . - A what ? A copycat . Whatever she sees , she can do . That 's just like what you did with me and the piano . A copycat . Copycat . Look at this . I shouldn 't know how to do this . I saw it on TV . Oh , my God . So if this is really happening to you , maybe we ought to go test it out . I didn 't know where else to go . You made the right choice . We 're going to do everything we can for Molly . In the meantime , we have someone else who needs us , and we would like you to bring her in . - Sending me into the field ? - Yes . - Molly needs me here . - No , no , no . Molly is our top priority here , but we need you out there doing the good work you do , helping others like her . And , uh , you 're gonna need this . This is how you help people ? By Tasering them ? Well , that 's just standard procedure to make sure everyone 's safe . A lot of the people we encounter aren 't in control of their abilities . Trust me , it 's easier to ask forgiveness than permission . Niki 's loose , grab her ! Down the hall . Grab her . Niki ? Aah ! What the hell is going on here ? So do you want to try something really rad ? Like a kick flip ? Slam dunk ? Well ... I always sucked at double Dutch . You want somethin ' , lady ? Yeah . I want to jump in . And don 't call me lady . It 's not much . I sleep in a pub , remember ? You paint ? Well , it 's what I do to relax . These are amazing . You 're talented . Is that why you kidnapped me ? So you could sort through me things ? Don 't like me less now that you 're peeling away the mystery . I just ... wanted to see where you lived . Lie on a real bed maybe . No one 's stopping you . What are you looking at ? Nothing . Then what is it that 's on your mind ? You were right . Whatever I was , whoever I am I have to face it . Nothing that I find in this box is gonna change anything . Whatever my life was before , this is where I want to be now . With you . OK ? OK . Get on with it then . Peter Petrelli ? I 'm from New York . Looks like you were leaving . This is an open ticket , New York to Montréal . Who 's that ? I wish I knew . None of this tells me how I got here , what I 'm supposed to do . What is it ? Peter ? Oh , my God , Peter ! You know , I 've never been in an Irish pub before . Do you have haggis ? That 's Scotland , love . We have stew . And mussels . And stew . But I 'm closing up . Oh , well ... Yeah , I was hoping you could help me . I 'm looking for a guy . Best time for that 's after a football match . The fellas are locked out of their minds . Up for anything . His name is Peter Petrelli . Never seen him before . Never seen him before ? No . Cool . Thanks . The thing is , I talked to a few people from the docks . They said they saw him in here . I don 't know what to tell you . Hmm . So either you 're lying , or all those other people are lying . It 's just kinda hard to tell who 's lying , you know ? Like I said I don 't know this Peter . That it now ? I guess so . Sorry I couldn 't be more help . Yeah . So am I. You gave us quite a scare . I 'm sorry about earlier . I 'm feeling much better now . Thank you . We knew it wouldn 't be easy . Multiple-personality disorder is a terrible affliction , but we 're gonna get you well again . I promise . Thank you . - I 'm gonna get you out of here . - I can 't leave . - Niki , you 're a prisoner . - I 'm not . I came here on my own . I gave up my son to be here . I 'm sick . I didn 't think anyone could ever understand my problems . What I 've done . What I 'm capable of . These are the only people that can help me . Nathan . Peter ? Peter ! Peter , I knew it . I knew you could survi ... You . You can 't run from me , Nathan . There 's a ... baby . Hey , you 've gotta get this baby out of here ! Hey ! Janice ? What are you doing in here ? Is that ... Janice , is that baby mine ? You said I wasn 't the father . But you read minds . You looked into my head and you saw the truth , but you still left . No . No , I didn 't . I didn 't know . You left him . Just like your father left you . Just like you 're gonna leave Molly . No . No , Janice . Janice ! Hey ... You 're no hero . Everybody 's dead because of you . - We have to stop it . - You can 't . You don 't want redemption . You want ignorance . Let 's go over the edge . You won 't feel anything . You never do . - You don 't know me . - I am you . Stop it , Nathan ! Nathan , wake up ! Nathan ... wake up , wake up . Nathan , wake up ! Wake up ! What happened ? Now we know why Molly calls him the nightmare man . You stopped it . How 'd you do that ? I don 't know . Oh , he 's gone . What are you looking for ? We need to know where he went . - Why he 's doing this . Something to ... - To what ? I knew this was a con . I knew I couldn 't trust him . I think I know where he 's headed . That 's Bob . - He 's one of them . - He runs the company . Not for long . Looks like he 's next . White Beard 's camp should be right over this ridge . We should leave Yaeko here then . Right after we defeat his entire army . That is amazing . Yeah . I know . But what do you think it all means ? Having these ... these powers . I think it means that we 're special . But why ? I mean , all this time I 've been praying to God to give me direction , to show me what I 'm supposed to do with my life . Of all the things He could give to me ... Maybe we 're supposed to do something with these . I just wish I knew what . It is way past your bedtime . Hey , this is our little secret . Right ? All right . I know it 's scary at first , but this is a good thing . I promise . I 'm just looking for some answers . That 's all . - Monica Dawson ? - Yes . I 'm Dr Mohinder Suresh . May I ? Can I help you ? I 'm sure you have lots of questions about what 's happening to you . Well , I have some answers . Hi . Yep . I 'm fine . Weather could be better . No , not yet , but I will . He 's here . Had to improvise a little , but ... No , I mean , I just had to use a little persuasion , that 's all . For ... No , it was just some guy . And ... All right , I killed him , OK ? What is the big deal ? What do you mean ? Now ? This is my assignment . And I almost have him . What if I promise not to ... Fine . I 'll come home now . Sorry , Daddy . It won 't happen again . What happened ? I don 't know . Apparently you 're a genius of an artist too . I painted that ? How ? How do you shoot lightning from your hands ? All I know is your eyes went dead , and you couldn 't be stopped . Until there was this . - Is that us ? - I don 't know , maybe . - What do you think this is ? - A church ? The street signs are in French . Could be Montréal . Like the plane ticket . Hello ? What ? Ricky ? Ricky ! Oh , my God , Ricky ! Ricky ! Look at me . Look at me . This is my fault . OK , they were looking for me . No , no , no , no ... Ricky ... I 'm gonna find ' em , OK ? I 'm gonna find ' em . I can 't hide anymore . I can 't hide .

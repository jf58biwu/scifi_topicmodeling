 Dad , what 's happening ? I need you to listen to me like we 're the last two people on the planet , okay , Nick ? Someday a girl is going to give you a flower . You got that ? A flower . And you have to help her , Nick . You help her and you help us all . Okay ? I know it doesn 't make any sense right now , but I believe the woman who told me that . You think you could believe me ? I love you . I always said you were special , Nick . Turns out I was right . ( BEEPS ) Division 's here , Nick . Just keep moving . And don 't make any decisions that any watcher can track . ( GASPS ) ( sighs ) ( MEN shouting ) I just wanted to have a conversation . ( GUN firing ) ( sighs ) What a waste . Bring his body to the lab . CASSIE : There are special people in this world . We don 't ask to be special . We 're just born this way . We pass you on the streets every day , unnoticed by most . It started in 1945 . The Nazis were conducting experiments in psychic warfare , trying to turn those with psychic abilities into soldiers . Lots of us died . The war ended , but the experiments never stopped . Other governments around the world set up what they called " Divisions " , trying to do what the Nazis couldn 't , to turn us into weapons . The Division 's agents are trained to track and hunt us down like animals , take us away from our families and friends . WOMAN 1 : There are children stuffed away all over the world . CASSIE : They test us and categorize us . I 'm what they call a " watcher " . We can see the future , even if that 's not always as simple as it sounds . NEWSCASTER 1 : Tonight , a jumbo jet crashed . There are no reports of survivors . CASSIE : Others are called " movers " , just an easy way of saying " telekinetic " . NEWSCASTER 2 : Much of the building collapsed after about two hours , leaving only a brick wall . " Pushers " put thoughts in your head and make whatever lie they come up with the truth . WOMAN 2 : They 'd already begun to control my mind ... NEWSCASTER 3 : The President ... ( MAN SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( shouting ) CASSIE : " Sniffs " , " shifters " , " shadows " , " bleeders " , it goes on and on . ln Division 's eyes , we 're all just lab rats . Only one problem : we keep dying . NEWSCASTER 4 : The evidence shows that the kids were given milk with radioactive iodine . CASSIE : No one has ever survived the drug meant to boost our powers . My name is Cassie Holmes . Division took my mom from me . Right now the future I see doesn 't look so great . The good news is the future is always changing in the largest of ways by the smallest of things . They 've been winning a lot of battles . Now it 's our turn to win the war . ( MONITOR BEEPING ) ( SIGHS ) ( MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY ) ( GASPING ) ( MONITOR FLATLINING ) ( GASPS ) ( MONITOR BEEPING ) ( ALARM BLARING ) She survived the injection . She 's our patient zero . Bring me every sniffer we have . But she 's on foot . She can 't get far . She 'll get help from anyone she can lay her eyes on . Do whatever is necessary to get her and that syringe back ! Now ! ( GREETlNG in CANTONESE ) ( CHEERlNG ) ( speaking CANTONESE ) So you want the bet or not ? ( speaking CANTONESE ) ( CHATTERlNG ) ( CHEERlNG ) HOLDEN : What you say there , Nick ? - nick : Who are you ? - We 're with Division . Like you didn 't know . - Go to hell . - Easy , son . If we wanted you , you 'd be in the back of a van . You gonna invite us in or are we gonna have to be rude ? Smart move , living in a shithole like this . One on top of the other . Took you far off the radar . Not far enough . ( SNIFFS ) Would you believe this is how we found you ? From your old toothbrush from that encounter 10 years ago . Barely a scent left . Thought you were in Tokyo . Then Malaysia . Finally we got a few readings on some buildings . ( SNIFFING ) There 's a lot of runaway psychics in Hong Kong trying to disappear , Nick . People with no country , no loyalty ... No desire to get involved in political bullshit . ( RESONATING ) Nobody but you in this apartment for a long time , Nick . Why ? You looking for someone besides me ? A girl . She has something belonging to us . Better than a hunch you know her . Obviously I don 't . ( SNIFFING ) In case we need to get a hold of you again . I 've got some old toilet paper you boys might like more . HOLDEN : Don 't bother running , Nick . We know where you are now . Shit . ( PHONE RINGING ) - Yeah ? - CASSIE : Hey , Nick . - Who is this ? - Open up , Nick . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) And put your gun down . ( GUN COCKS ) Put that thing away . Got you something . Where 's the chicken I saw ? There it is . Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Excuse me ? This is how you treat your guests ? This is how I treat random strangers who barge into my apartment . Like the Division sniffers who were just here ? Who are you ? I 'm Cassie . I 'm here to help you . Listen , Cassie , I 'm sure your mom and dad are nervous about you right now , so why don 't you ... - You don 't understand . - You got that right . This is about us finding $ 6 million . That 's us . And that 's our money . And that 's my toothbrush . You 're a watcher . So is there a place we can get something to eat besides chicken ? I 'm buying . Lose a bet with your hairdresser ? I like color . First things first . I know you 're a second-generation mover . Is that what the kids are calling it these days ? I 'll let you know when I see one . You don 't really use your powers , which means you haven 't practiced , so you kind of suck at it . How am I doing so far ? - Go on . - I 'm a watcher . Second generation , like you . - Wow , that 's ... - Complicated . 'Cause the future can change just by talking about it . So I see glimpses and I draw it in my book . But I 'm not really good at it . I 'm kind of a crappy artist , but I 'm sure you already knew that . But I got the sniffs in your apartment right . That 's why I brought you a new toothbrush . ( SPEAKING CANTONESE ) You speak Chinese ? Cantonese . I 'm surprised you didn 't know that , being a watcher . I get things wrong sometimes . I know the feeling . Are you worried about the thugs you owe money to ? Don 't . Thank you . We 'll be able to take care of it in a couple of days . - With your $ 6 million . - Mmm-hmm . Where 's the money ? It 's on its way here . With a girl . Don 't tell me . The same girl Division sniffs are looking for . - It 's Cassie , right ? - Mmm-hmm . Enjoy your food . - That 's it ? - That 's it . Sorry . Some 12-year-old that knew I needed a new toothbrush isn 't enough to get me involved with Division . Even if it 's not a con . I 'm 13 . And I 've been told that I look at least 14 . ( CHUCKLES ) Right . And this is not a con . This is a way for everyone to get something that they want . I 've actually used that line before . Fine . Don 't believe me . But you will help me . Really ? ' Cause I 'm getting a message . It 's telling me , " Find somebody else . " If we don 't find the case and that girl , really bad things happen , Nick . What ? What 's wrong ? ( INAUDIBLE ) Shit . They 're here in the market . Who ? Who ? They 're in the market ! Come on ! - Division ? - Bleeders ! We got to get out of here ! - How does this end ? - I have no idea . POP FATHER : Where is the girl ? My daughter has already seen you with her . Told you . Look , I told three people already today , I don 't know this girl . Stupid child . I already saw how you die . Then you know it 's not here and it 's not today . ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) Damn . Go , go ! ( SCREAMING SHRILLY ) Go , go ! ( SCREAMING SHRILLY ) Nick ! ( SPEAKING CANTONESE ) CASSIE : This way ! ( BOTH SCREAMING SHRILLY ) ( CASSIE SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING SHRILLY ) Stop ! Stop ! Run , Cassie ! Stop ! ( GRUNTING ) ( SPEAKING CANTONESE ) ( STOPS SCREAMING ) I already know you 're here . You must be Cassie Holmes . Who sent you ? Your mother . A week before she was captured by Division , she told me to be at that fish market today . Stay away from him . If that 's what you want . Just be sure to add his picture to the Wall of the Dead . - You 're a stitch . - That should be obvious to a watcher , if you had even a modicum of your mother 's talent . I 've been dealing with a lot . Years ago your mother did me a favor . Now it would seem I need to pay off my debt . I hear they 've got your mother buried deep inside Division . Have her so drugged up she can 't even hold a spoon . I bet they suck the future right out of her . ( GASPS ) ( GRUNTING ) You help her and you help us all . ( GRUNTING ) A flower ... Is he okay ? ( PANTING ) You okay ? Yeah . ( SIGHS ) Wow . That woman 's got magic fingers . For you . What is that ? It 's a lotus . I heard what she said about your mother . You did ? Division 's got her . They locked her up because she 's the greatest watcher they 've ever seen . And they 're afraid of her , and they 're afraid they can 't control her . They killed my father for the same reason . But I guess you already knew that . I see the future , not the past . And right now our future isn 't that great . That 's new ? Now those sniffs from your apartment are going to get the girl and the case . It 's changed . I don 't know why . Just something I did , a mistake I made . Doesn 't matter . It just ... Just has . My mother told me that that case is the key to bringing down Division and freeing her . There 's no money in that case , is there ? Well , unless I 'm missing something , they don 't have the case yet . ( GROANS ) It 's still out there . If your mother 's such a great fortune-teller , how did she get caught ? I 'm just going to have to ask her that myself . I haven 't even gotten to the bad part yet . What is that ? We die . ( SCOFFS ) Great . Hello , Kira . - You have a plane to catch . Come on . - You want to come with us . Christ . Get a load of that . She must use that , like , 10 times a day . That 's a keeper . You 're not gonna be having a lot of lipstick opportunities where you 're going , you know what I mean ? She 's doing it again . - Get the hell out of my head ! - No ! No ! What does she want ? She 's got to go to the bathroom . To throw up or something . Carver will kill us if anything happens to her . - Bathroom ? - This way . MACK : Come on . Coffee , black , no sugar . All right . In you go . ( SIGHS ) You 're a good man , Agent Mack . I bet you come from a good family . It must have been hard for you when he died . Who died ? Your brother . - I don 't have a brother , sweetheart . - No , you do . I 've got something that will make you feel better . And you loved him very much . But he was murdered . And you know who did it , don 't you ? KIRA : But he was murdered . And you know who did it , don 't you ? ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) KIRA : And you know who did it , don 't you ? But he was murdered .

Yeah , it 's a bead . It 's a shimmery shimmer I did there . Well , it looks like a pimento . If I was going to draw a bead , I 'd ... It 's a bead with a shimmer . What does the bead have to do with it ? I don 't know what the shiny , shimmery bead has to do with it . Great . All right . Well , let 's keep it simple . We 'll start with the bead and see where it takes us . Sounds like a plan , but what about the part where we die ? I remember growing up together . Where we went to school . How he died .

You already checked it . It 's not loaded . Spread these beads to any sniff , any watcher , any goddamn expatriate reader in Hong Kong who knows up from down ( GUN FIRES ) till we find Kira . What about the Chinese government and their guys ? The story 's out . Bleeders all over the country will be looking for her . We can 't let them get the drug .

WATERS : That 's five . - Keep the change . - Thank you . I know who you are . When I was in Division , her mother was at the top of every watch list there was . You worked for Division ? You want to know about Division ? Ten years . No thank you , no pension . I was put out on the street with a threat to not shift again . Only the sniffs caught up with me in Chicago . I was just trying to buy something nice for my wife . Next day I get a call , she 's dead . Car accident . But my wife doesn 't drive . But I don 't have to remind you how that feels , right ? We need this . An olive ? It 's a bead . It 's supposed to lead us to someone we need to find before Division does . Excuse me ! May I ? ( WOMAN GROANS ) Thank you . You 're welcome .

A bead that looks like this one is supposed to lead us to a girl . ( SIGHS ) You with Division ? Are you looking at us ? The truth is , the girl who dropped that bead is supposed to have a suitcase that will bring down Division . Cassie here thinks that if we don 't find it , we die . ( SNICKERS ) And you believe her ? ( SIGHS ) She 's pretty convincing . Well , consider me unconvinced . - Well , looks like we 've just got to wait . - For what ? You have about one minute to help us . And what 's that ?

Whoa , whoa ! - Kira ? - Damn it ! - What the hell are you doing here ? - There goes my ride ! - Don 't . - Don 't ? Don 't what ? You 're the girl everyone 's looking for ? - I should kill you , Nick . - Hey ! You know this psycho ? - What happened to you ? - Now you want to know ? What is that supposed to mean ? I thought you left . You stopped returning my calls . Division caught me and locked me up . - What ? - And you never came . I looked for you . I did ! You didn 't find me . Done ! Whatever , you had a thing . Get over it . I really suggest we discuss this somewhere else . ( SIRENS WAILING ) Let 's go , Nick . Kira . Division 's looking for you . They 're looking for the case . And so are you . What 's in that case , Kira ? I don 't know . All I know is that I woke up on a boat next to a note I 'd written saying to look for you and you 'd help me find the case . I don 't remember anything about the last couple of days , no matter how hard I try . You must have had yourself wiped . Erased memories make it harder for Division to track you . Not the ones of you . Can I talk to you for a sec ? Can it wait ? I 'm kind of in the middle of something . No . You , me , and my mom . I 've never seen my moms death before . It 's her , Nick . She 's changing the future , and she 's making it worse . - We 've got to dump her . - Dump her ? Cassie , we ... Cassie , we just found her . And she doesn 't have the case . Which is what we 're looking for , - if you remember . - Yeah , I know . We find her , we find the case . The three of us . Yeah , and then Division finds her . Yeah , the three of us . We 'll get a shadow , so they can 't trace her . - Satisfied ? - No . Cassie , you got to trust me . Hey , I 'm not the one with the trust issues here . You better do something quick , 'cause I 'm getting sick of drawing dead bodies . That 's him . - Hey , Pinky . - Hey , Nick . How you doing ? All right , who 's feeling the heat ? All right . Here 's how this works . I get 10 grand a day for shadowing Miss Trouble . As long as she stays within 20 feet of me , no sniff is gonna find her . I don 't care if they 're standing right on top of us and have a piece of her fingernail . - Happy ? - Overcome . Come on . Let 's find a place to think . So , Pinky , your wife give you that name ? No , the Division did , sweetheart . Back in the day . ( SIGHS ) I 'm sorry . I can 't remember anything about the case . Shocking . ( TOILET FLUSHING ) Can I clean up without getting killed ? PINKY : Don 't forget to wash behind your ears . Nice girlfriend you got there . Yeah . She used to be . NICK : I met her running cons on Coney Island tourists . ( CHUCKLES ) We did everything together . Everything . CASSIE : So we 're just gonna sit around and wait for her to get her memory back , and hope that she 'll tell us where the case is before Carver gets it ? Or us . Great plan . Where you going ? I saw a chicken place downstairs . Want to come ? No , I 'm good . I want to stay here , see if I can help . Have fun with that . Where you going ? ( SNICKERS ) Relax , Romeo .

If I don 't go to him , he 'll come for us . Emily , it 's Nick . Listen , Division sent a pusher named Carver to Hong Kong . I need you to find him . Just use that bead they gave you . I 'm sure his hands were all over it . ( SPEAKING CANTONESE ) I 'm not hungry . ( GUNS COCKING ) Henry Carver . Now there 's a face I haven 't seen in a long time . Sit down .

Kira is our patient zero . And with her we 're going to create an army the world 's never seen before . I 'm sorry . Am I supposed to care ? Fine . Fuck patriotism . The girl will die unless she receives the necessary injections . And you 're not going to find it anywhere but with me . Maybe you care about that . Tell me something , Nick .

Kira hid it somewhere in Hong Kong . Can you draw us a way out of this ? We can 't change anything with that bitch tracking us . - The second we do , she 's gonna see it . - What do you mean ? She sees intentions . What we decide to do . I decide to cross the street , so she sees me crossing the street . What if nothing we did made sense ? Or we just kept changing our mind , like we didn 't know exactly what we were gonna do ? Would that throw her off ? It might , but we still have to find the case .

It said a lot on there . Was everyone 's that complicated ? I knew you could handle it . This immunosuppressant will save your life and allow you to reach your full potential . You 're going to be a better you , Kira . You need to accept this reality . CARVER : We 're not trying to hurt you , Kira . Matter of fact , your well-being means everything to us . Understand it 's not your fault for forgetting who you are and running from us . The drug has side effects . We have no way of knowing the severity . I want you to know that I blame myself for that , Agent Hollis . This isn 't real . You volunteered , Kira . I was against it . CARVER : You were certain you 'd be the one to survive the drug . I had to support you . After all , we were partners . ( GASPS ) Then you panicked . Did you think you made it all the way here and eluded us for so long without any training ? That 's the Division in you , Kira . Now let me help you remember . CARVER : Now let me help you remember . I keep trying to draw something different , but I can 't . It has something to do with how I die . It 's a tiger . I 'm serious . I don 't know how I know , but I just know . I know I act like I don 't care sometimes , but I don 't want to die . Cassie . It 's not gonna happen , okay ? Just tell me that I 'm a crappy artist and that I 'm wrong . You are a crappy artist and you are wrong . Listen to me . You 've already done more than enough for everyone . The only thing you got to worry about right now is keeping yourself safe . But how ? You just start walking . Don 't even think about where you 're going . You just keep moving . Don 't make any decisions any watcher can track . And when you come across someplace safe , you hide . Simple as that . I don 't know how , but I know this is gonna work out . I promise . No need to be scared . Trust me . That 's more like it . What are you gonna do ? ( SIGHS ) ( SNICKERS ) I can 't tell you . ( BOTTLES CRASHING ) ( GUN COCKS ) You make me look like a fool in front of my family ! ( SCREAMING ) Don 't worry . You won 't remember a thing . Your mother 's very proud . NICK : I want to make a deal . The drug for the girl . CARVER : Okay . Dock 4 , Man Yuen Street . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Where is the case , Nick ? Kira ! Go ahead . Remember that night under the roller coaster ? We parked in the rain and got those little bottles of Jack . That was the first time you told me you loved me . CARVER : He remembers . I want to hear it from him . I remember . It never happened . We met for the first time yesterday . You 've never been to Coney Island . ( SNICKERS ) KIRA : Nobody 's been to Coney Island . I used you , Nick . And the quicker we find that case , the quicker I 'll let you forget it . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) You might as well . WATERS : My card says you have to take the drug . Give me Carver . It 's for you . - Hello ? - You want the case , you let them live . I 'll tell you exactly where it is . - Another ? - Sure . One for the road . Don 't feel too bad . That push of Kira 's has worked on better men . ( GRUNTS ) 4100 . Kill him . If that 's all right with you ? POP FATHER : The case ! Agent Carver . The contents of this case are the property of the United States government . Government ? We are the only government here . Be reasonable . There is no need for anyone to die . We 're not much for diplomacy these days . Victor ! Make me a way out of here ! ( GROANING ) CARVER : Kira ! NICK : Kira ! ( SCREAMING ) Kira . ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING SHRILLY ) Whoa ! I 'm impressed . The engineers are always conservative with their projections , but this is something else . Hey ! We are on the same side . Remember ? Now why don 't you march the men who tried to kill us off this roof , and we 'll call it a day . Wait ! Kira ! Don 't do this ! This isn 't you . It 's a push . What Carver told you is a lie . I 'm sure they make a card for this . ( GRUNTING ) Where were we ? Where were we ? - You don 't want to do that . - Watch me . You 'd be doing me a favor if you did . What 's in that needle will kill you . I went through hundreds of potentials to find her . She 's our survivor . Look at me . You know me . NICK : And I know you . Look at me . Let him do it . ( GROANS ) What a waste . I told you to bring an umbrella . I thought you said it was gonna rain . I also told you I get things wrong sometimes . Maybe it will wash the crap out of your hair . So where 's the real case ? There it is . How long do you think your mother has been planning this ? Since before I was born . This is the key , Nick . Division will do anything to keep this from getting into the wrong hands . So we trade your mom for the drug ? I 'm still working on that one . Hey , what was it that I injected myself with ? Nine Dragon Soy Sauce . That 's gross . CASSIE : What about Kira ? NICK : You 're the watcher . You tell me . CASSIE : Don 't worry . We 'll see Miss Trouble soon enough . - When do I open it ? - When you start to doubt the truth . KIRA : Put your gun in your mouth . Pull the trigger . ( GUN FIRES )

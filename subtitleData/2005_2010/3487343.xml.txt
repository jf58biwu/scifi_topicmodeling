 Previously on Kings When i read the signs in my life , they say that I was sent here to help you . Then do that . They only use people like us . Look what they do . Make me wait all day to get paid because my son died . We will in six months ' time Give over port prosperity in exchange for lasting peace . Why are you cutting him out ? Because he is taking up too much attention . - He 's a good person . - He 's not that virtuous . No one is . I 've been keeping pictures of our family Out of the free press for years . Being king is a young man 's game And silas is growing old . We need to know we have a replacement at the ready . What do you call it when i go to the countryside ? We say you 're in serenity . Then serenity ends . Silas . Silas . Lucky for the rain . Silks came in . 20 days or so we 'll be ready to harvest . What do you mean we , city boy ? You gonna give up your parades and princesses And get your hands dirty ? King only gave me a 48-Hour furlough . Figures . Ethan . Why did you send back my check ? I don 't want silas ' money . You don 't have to step up for eli alone . He was my brother too . Boys ! Come on in ! So anybody been in the tabloids lately ? shut it . Daniel . Table . I just want to check the score . ... Gilboa and gath . - A future in which our people- - - Why is the king on every channel ? ... Instead of bullets and bombs . Port prosperity , a city once conquered From gath now pledged by me for return , Carrying their pledge for peace . No lean sacrifice , but fair . In order to safeguard that pledge , I know make public our intention To return to gath not just port prosperity , But all territory taken in the battle of prosperity - Including lands north of the river . - That 's us . - ? - He just gave away our home . Redraw our own map , make our face ugly . You have to talk him out of this . - Me ? - You 're his hero . He doesn 't listen to people like me . If he won 't , others will . You could speak out . You need to try , david . ... As the city builds up its infrastructure to house ... This is not a policy . This is a decree . This may well be our king 's right , But it is not just . He calls for peace , But denies me the cost . Good day to be a critic . This criticism will embolden your enemies . How should we proceed ? - Sir . - Captain shepherd . You were with your family when i made my announcement . How did they react to my decree ? They feel betrayed , sir . My father and brother died to defend our home And you just gave it to the ones who killed them . There must be something else we can trade with gath To preserve the border towns . - You could postpone- - - You were not brought here to debate the merit Of my decisions . Only to determine the position of your loyalty . With your family . With your king . - I see both sides . - Oh , both sides amounts to neither . David , do you believe that there are forces Beyond our understanding That have given me this role ? I believe you were chosen king for a reason . And when i ask you to trust me , will you ? Port prosperity has called a forum . You will go and publicly endorse the king 's position . No one cares what i think . My family will disown me . Which is why the people will care what you think . To see you of all sacrifice to your king will sway others . And if it doesn 't ? Then you will identify anyone attempting To undermine the king 's decision And bring them to my attention . We will have peace . And those who obstruct it are wolves Carving out my flock for food . David , your family may not like it , But your king needs your help . kings s01ep05 Capture : FRM @ ´ ó ± ¦ Sync : FRS @ ÉÍ ² Êºçãå · çÓê × · · çÓê ¿ ´ ² Êºç You worry where you shouldn 't . Don 't rush lines on your face , hmm ? The handover of port prosperity will proceed as planned . Unless the people won 't allow it . People will cool off just like this omelet . Now come on , sit down . We 're going to eat . They 're already starting to protest . You don 't care what your people say about you ? A handful grumbling at the press . No cause for alarm . A healthy exercising of the freedoms I 'm pretty sure i gave them . You should put down your apron And go to their rally at prosperity . Show them their king still cares . I prefer it when you harp on healthcare . Yeah , well i know how it feels to not be heard . The people cannot have what they want at every turn . Neither can you . That 's the definition of governing and parenting . My presence there would only inflame . Besides , i got the situation under control . I sent my best man . Who ? Silas didn 't listen , did he ? He 's not gonna budge . We 'll set him straight . I 'm glad you 're with us . I skipped breakfast . Even when i 'm pissed at him I take the omelet . Thanks for the support . Trying to change his mind ? You 'd have an easier time asking the rain to stop . Uniform , please . I 've run out of ways to please him . He 's used to everyone loving him . He doesn 't see as well as he used to . Or maybe he just doesn 't care . He would if he understood . This is different . They 're already calling it " port calamity . " People are gathering right now to protest this . - Really ? Who is ? - Plenty . That 's just awful . Well , if you really want to help him , Maybe some criticism is exactly what he needs . You have the air of a man who 's made a decision . Not yet , uncle . I made you an offer , jack . You 've left me waiting for an answer . How about a token then ? Something to help me make up my mind . You 're buying unity news network . Huh . You read the paper ? Why is everyone surprised when i pay attention ? It 's the largest news station in the country And it 's yours . I want a hand in it . " Buy me a toy , uncle . " But news doesn 't seem your speed . Or yours . Maybe we 're both just sad About the state of free press in shiloh . - It 's a crime . - Shameful . My father needs the media today . If i were the one controlling his public image ... He 'd have to give you more than scraps from the table . He 'd have to kiss my ass . Is this what it 'll take ? The price of your support against your father ? We need our man at the turn of history , jack . We need our new king and soon . Let 's just say this will help me make my decision . I can 't believe he did this ! From a damned coffee pot ! You stood where the poor man was serving . Well , he should 've anticipated . Have him hung . Hanged . Laundry is hung . Valets are hanged . And so are queens ... who correct their husbands . - What ? - Sir , your meeting . Oh , haven 't i got enough on my head today ? Didn 't i ask that rescheduled ? - It was . - Well , do it again . I have . Shall i put miss ghent off a third time ? Katrina ghent ? Well . Now i see why she donated so generously At first night . - What does she want ? - Well , i can live with the mystery . Send her away . Centerfold , december , ' 95 . - April , ' 96 . - December . Snow boots . Definitely furry snow boots . I 've seen better . - Who ? - Miss ghent , the king has to reschedule . Then i got dressed today for no reason . - Our sincerest apologies . - Save the apology . Name the price . I need an audience with the king And you 're the dragon at every gate . - Even dragons eat . - Ma 'am . Oh , come , woman . I have too much money not to give you some . Think that as a donation towards your sister 's care . That institution can 't be cheap . - You 're underestimated . - And right tired of it . Last chance . No ? you 're a very good dragon . - Where are we supposed to go ? - Premiere , what about our jobs ? They 're talking about a resettlement package For everyone . New homes , new jobs . The port at pella 's being expanded To route all shipping and dock work . He can 't do that to us . My brother works for the king and even he 's here with us . Captain shepherd . Captain . We all saw how you took out that tank And we 're all proud that you come from around here . My family lives north of the river . We 'll be asked to move just like you . So do you think the king is right ? I hate the idea of losing our home . I lost my father . My brother . I know a lot of you here lost people too . And it 's natural to say they died for this land And we 're never giving it up . That 's right . But i 'd happily trade our farm to bring dad or eli back . Lives are more important than livelihood . I think of all the other fathers and brothers Who are gonna go on living because silas ended the war And it makes me love our king even more . What will your king do if we refuse ? Will he forcefully evict us out of our homes ? As i understand it , If you choose to stay you 'll be living in gath . God gave us this land ! And not even silas can take it away ! ? Yeah ! Who will stand with me Against the king ? - ethan , Ethan , stop . - Our blood ! Our land ! - Our blood ! Our land ! - Don 't do this ! - our blood ! Our land ! - Stop ! our blood ! Our land ! Our blood ! Our land ! Our blood ! Our land ! Our blood ! Our land ! Our blood ! Our land ! Our blood ! Our land ! Polls indicating overwhelming public support For king silas ' decision to return port prosperity- - This is where it happens . Where the news gets crafted , Then run by your father every day . It looks so ... honest . Maybe you can make it more so . I 've benefitted more than any . But this country needs an information source That won 't kneel to the king 's approval . The first town crier to cry freely . Your father will be so proud . Port prosperity . ... Directly affected by the handover of port prosperity . Let 's bring in some criticism . Give voice to the opposition . Those who think he 's being unkind To our gentle heartlanders . Yes . You listen to him . We 'll make the king look foolish . Hmm . And later in the day When he looks foolish still And he tells all the other cameras to leave , You tell ours to stay . ... Peaceful protest at the docks of port prosperity . I 'm going to port prosperity . I 'm not sure that 's advisable . Just do it . - Thank you . - Mm-Hmm . - Thank you . - Oh , well thank you all . - Thank you . - We 're so proud . Next time , lorem , to the championships . I 'm from the south , and in case you 'd forgotten We hate lorem . Now you 're king . You don 't have a favorite team . I used to break things when they 'd win . Sir , the protest at port prosperity . My daughter 's already bent my ear on this . Still it--It might be prudent To call an emergency meeting . We did something that was unpopular but necessary . There are those that will pitch their fits . I 've dispatched captain shepherd . I trust him to do all the situation requires . Perhaps i 'm not making the situation clear , sir . The protestors are threatening to shut down the port . - This is- - - This is a tantrum . I will not be drawn in . Keep your mood where it is . Your staff will dust off the guillotine . Hmm ? Take a bath . Read a book . Fire someone . But this new habit of barking at every shadow Is unsustainable . What about the countryside ? Hmm ? You always come back so refreshed And likeable when you go there . Time for a trip , hmm ? - Trip ? - um . Not a bad idea . Thomasina . Let 's go get some air . Reverend , a word ? William cross come to my congregation . Now i really have seen everything . Don 't get your hopes up , ephram . It 's you i 've come to see . Not him . I will always hope for you . Change is in the air . Like winter . Can you smell the wood burning ? I have . Silas will fall . That may be his fate . - Someday . - Someday soon maybe . And i want to know when that time comes If you can set aside our differences And do what is best for the people . Like we did once when we were young And saw a king in silas . You and did not make silas king . Ha . Funny . I don 't remember him writing any checks . Minds are gathering . Resources . More every day . A group will be meeting to consider the season . We 'd like you to join us . Time to be young again . God ... Will choose the next king of this realm . Not you . Then ask you boss who he 's chosen . Line thrown out . Trout brought in . Necessity turned to pastime . Mediated by luck . Attributed to skill . It 's all in the wrist , you know . Sir , we have reports . The press is aware you 're here . Oh , you two ! All nervous , huh ? Hanson , you 're like a cat at the edge of the tub . Let a man relax . Sir . A bad time ? Seems you have your audience . I don 't blame you for avoiding me , The notorious katrina ghent , tabloid staple . Who clearly doesn 't deserve a word of it . So i married for money . He was a syphilitic walrus . Explain the intrusion before i sit you on my fish . I sold my reputation for a lot of money . I want to buy it back . Make me a minister in your boardroom . A minister ? Do you have any special qualifications I should know about ? - An area of expertise ? - Oh , you pick . I don 't care about power . Assign whoever you want to run the thing And tell me my mind . I just want a seat at the table . You 're offering to buy a ministry . And overpay . Unlucky for you , There 's no positions in my government For sale today . But i admire forthrightness . So i 'm going to pardon you For trying to bribe a sovereign while wet . Good day , mrs . Ghent . The situation could explode at any minute And he 's fishing . With her . He 's not himself . Law enforcement has been on the scene As a precautionary measure . But it appears the situation is escalating In port prosperity . Our land ! God 's land ! Our land ! God 's land ! - Our land ! God 's land ! - Don 't put this on god . You don 't really believe that . - I believe in our family . - So do i ! Come on . You sold us out for the palace life . Our land ! God 's land ! Our land ! You lost yourself . You 're a traitor . - God 's land ! - We 're not going anywhere ! Ethan ! Ethan ! Ethan ! Ethan ! Come on ! - Block the door ! - Block the door ! What were you thinking ? You slew your goliath . Maybe silas is mine . This isn 't a competition , ethan . Fighting over the good spot on the couch . This is real . What are you doing ? What we have to . They shot first into an unarmed crowd . We have the right to defend ourselves . This was never a rally , was it ? You planned an insurrection . Silas didn 't give us a choice . We 're gonna shut down the whole port . Stop everything from moving . Now we have the whole world watching . We 'll be here every day humiliating him , until he does right by us , By our country . Or he could just kill you , ethan . Killing us will turn the whole country against him . We 've tied his hands . You go out there and you tell ' em We won 't stand for it . We want our god-Given land back . And we want the freedom to live on it . We have an update from port prosperity . They barricaded themselves And sent captain shepherd out with a statement . " We 've fought for the king and spilled our blood , But if he tries to take our land We will fight against him . " Local police have requested military assistance . They don 't need it . At last count , one is dead , 31 injured . - Shepherd reports a compliment of guns . - They can play at soldiers all they want . We will not get involved . Sir . I have concern . For your heart . Doctor gave it a clean bill just winter . Not the function . The temperature . I fear it 's gone cold . Since serenity , sir . Since you stopped going . I know of no such place . So it seems . You have a point ? Without it ... Without her , You have not been yourself as .. as i know you . What you spite sharply escapes notice . And what gave you pause doesn 't . And without the countervalence of warmth , You 've grown mean , sir . And i don 't know how to serve this cold silas . And my duty is to protect the family . Then do it from the car . How heavily armed are the rebels ? They 're not rebels . They 're people like you and me just trying to make a point for the cameras . The mayor just ordered us to go in and shut them down . No , you can 't move in on the building . We need to wait the protestors out . I 'm taking my orders from the mayor now . You take your orders from the king . I 'm going in to speak on his behalf . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna give them a chance to save themselves And show them someone still cares . I care . My brother ethan is in there . I can 't let you do this . This--This isn 't your place . Michelle . Keep him here . I 'm going in . You 're gonna let the princess walk in there ? Don 't let her go in there ! Three port prosperity police officers Who are listed in stable condition . Wait . Is that michelle benjamin ? Yes , we are seeing princess michelle Making her way to the front of the stronghold . Until just a few moments ago , It seemed like the police were gearing up for some sort of- - You 're not gonna believe this . Ethan shepherd . Does this mean silas is cancelling the handover ? No . He 's not gonna change his mind . Then what are you doing here ? I came to apologize . The king shouldn 't have given up your land without consulting you . That 's what you 're offering ? An apology ? And a deal . Lay down your guns and i go out to the press And announce that the king has granted you all amnesty . You can go back to your lives . Your families . This uprising forgiven in full . So he doesn 't even know you 're here . ? If i speak for him , for you , He has no choice but to honor it . You think we 're gonna quit when we 've come this far ? It 's that or prison . Either way what you 're doing here is gonna ' cause your families more suffering than a handover of land every could . I think we could do a lot better than that . - What are you doing ? - Forcing the king 's hand . - This isn 't the plan . - We can settle everything today . Let 's see silas ignore us now . Bring in the king 's own ! Storm ' em ! Kill everyone inside ! - She gets out safe . - She will . Media blackout . No impediments . - Already done . Only unn refuses to comply . We got baker at the helm . Call him , tell him to pull ' em out . It 's not baker anymore , sir . Jack ? Call katrina ghent . ? Out . Secure the perimeter . ? We 're the only network To defy the king 's blackout order . - We 're getting pressure . - Dear god . Not pressure . My father sent his own daughter in harm 's way to be his mascot . If he 's ordering a media blackout Then she already failed And he doesn 't want anyone knowing it . I say we broadcast some embarrassment . I say we don 't . Kill the live feed . Go to black or find the weather . We 're off the port . Excuse me . Why is anyone listening to her ? Because they just got the message i own the place . Crossgen owns the network . It did . I just bought up the whole mess of shares . My lawyers told me it 's called an " angry takeover , " Something like that . What do i know ? You must 've really pissed off your dad . He had katrina ghent buy it out from under us . He 's that scared of transparency . Or of you having any real power . He 'd rather appoint that whore than let you assert yourself . You wanted my answer . You have it . No doubts . I 'm in . Deep as you need me . A pawn lost . But we have our king . He 's no good to us without samuels . Without his blessing , The public will never support a coup against silas . Samuels will come . A truly unprecedented and historic move by the royal family at prosperity With michelle benjamin stunning local officials by meeting with protestors , Now called rebels by some . We now have word and can confirm that the situation is resolved . A peaceful resolution . Who 's in command here ? I am . Sir , you should know not all the protestors inside meant to risk her life . His brother 's one of the rebels . He means to defend him . One shepherd leaves my flock . The other leads them astray . Yes , he took radical action to force your hand , but he would never hurt her . Others would . She 's there . When she was chipped , i prayed never to have to use it . She 's surrounded by my best marksmen . When i give the order , just like flipping the switch , Evveryone in there save michell goes dark . They don 't deserve this . My daughter 's in there at gunpoint . I don 't care if the whole world dies as long as she comes out safe . My family has given up so much for you . Please don 't take ethan from us . Let me go in there . I can talk to them . I can try to get them to give themselves up . This is the safest and best plan , The only way to secure her safety . Give me a chance . Why should i trust my daughter 's life to chance ? When everything inside me screamed I was betraying my family , I still trusted you . You have two minutes , but know this . Once in there , we cannot distinguish you from other . And in two minutes ' time if you 're still in there And standing you die with the others . You coddle him . This is no time for it . We should proceed with the original plan . Enough . It 's over . The press is gone . Everyone is ... Except men with guns . Put down yours . While you still have a chance . But our cause is right . We can 't surrender . Martyring yourselves won 't change anything . No one will even know . God will . God will know . GET OUT . NOW . Excuse me . What about mom , huh ? What about our family ? I 'm doing this for them . You 're not doing this for them . Or god . You 're doing this for you . What do you know ? You left us ! You couldn 't stand that i actually did something - While you did nothing . - I took care of mom ! Mom won 't survive if she loses another son ! You think this honors eli ? You 're nothing like him . Thank god he 's dead . Because if he could see you He 'd be ashamed . Now . You can stop worrying . I 'm fine . Oh , good . Now i can have you killed . I should kill your serviceman too . He answers to me , not you . Not ever . That was the deal . Do anything that stupid again and all deals are off , Save the one i made with your jailor . - You had me chipped ? - When you were five . Your words today at the river . Sir . More than i ever heard you string together in a month . Now you 've been in my employ in this capacity for how long ? - I don 't keep count . - How long ? Ten years , eight months , some days . Maybe it 's time for a promotion . Klotz , where can i find shepherd ? Already sent for him waiting on the king , ma 'am . Oh , my god . You love thomasina . Since when ? First night . Hair up . Something happened . - You are so screwed . - Oh , i 'm so screwed . Let me explain . You picked the wrong time to stretch your wings . I didn 't know michelle was at risk When i told the cameras to stay . - I didn 't know . - And if you did ? I might 've done the same . You should be careful accepting gifts from your uncle . They 're never actually gifts . You push me to prove myself Then cut me down when i aspire . It doesn 't exactly encourage . No , i haven 't been fair to you , have i ? Some ministry positions have recently opened And i 'm thinking of offering one To someone in name only . Maybe you should have the job of it . - You 're giving me a ministry ? - The teeth behind the title . Teach you to exercise power without credit . That 's if you 're still interested in the position . I am . I think you two will enjoy working together . I don 't know where they took him . There 's no record of ethan at any of the jails . It 's like they made him disappear . I didn 't know we did that . I 'm so sorry . What you did ... Trying to save a princess who doesn 't know her place ... You don 't have a place . He 's lucky to have someone as loyal as you . Captain . The king awaits . Show him , abner . He 's earned the right . You were watching ethan before the rally ? Your brother and his accomplices Have been conspiring for weeks . You knew what they were gonna do . That there was gonna be an uprising And you let this happen ? A lone messenger sent out to face an angry mob . An inadequate response to make me look deaf and dumb And all the while fishing as the crisis played on . - To see who took the bait . - Draw out the enemies . You never wanted me to succeed . The people have the right To mock , scorn , criticize , and burn Unflattering photographs in effigy until morning . But i will not have my country Drawn back into war by opportunists or fanatics . - What 's gonna happen to my brother ? - He committed treason . He saved michelle . Which is why he 's alive to stand trial . I cannot brook insurrection . But on your pledge that he will return to face trial ... I 'll release him into your custody . Sir . I don 't know why you think he deserves special treatment . Only concern yourself with that i do . The reverend samuels and william Absent from our catch ? I 'd have thought them first in the bucket . We have no evidence against them . Should some be manufactured ? Their day will come . Why did you warn me it was a trap ? Because silas has grown soft . And is no longer the man i swore to follow . Ethan . Ethan . Don 't talk to me anymore , david . Don 't talk to any of us . welcome to subtitles by Nilesh Shah

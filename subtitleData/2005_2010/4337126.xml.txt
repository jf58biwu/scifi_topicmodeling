I 'm not here to stop you . There are government interests . They 're trying to keep control of what is happening here . They have decided to have you involved . But it is not why I want you . I want you involved because you 're a good scientist and I respect you . Which you demonstrated to me by framing me for plagiarism . I pointed out that you had managed to do something with almost no resources . That we failed to do with tens of millions and the United States military . You tagged the creature .

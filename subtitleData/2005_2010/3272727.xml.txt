 { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } The treatment that almost killed Wes , it 's working . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } I knew you could do it . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a well-established medical treatment . There 's evidence that it can help with intracranial abscess , an increase of pus in the brain . - That 's what you 've got ? - I think so . Bob , { \ I 'm } sorry about what happened { \ up } on the roof . Get better , Wes , okay ? What 's in Sweden ? They 're using RNAi to stop the hep-C virus . Can I get into those trials ? You 're in ! Well , I 'm on my bike like five nights a week , I thought it might be fun to go for a ride after work together some time . I hear you 're off to Sweden , great . Everywhere you look , you can think of me . Here you go . You 're not quitting , Wes . - Yes I am . - You 'll be back . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } What do you mean they haven 't stopped the race ? No , listen , over two dozen people with lung infections is not an isolated incident . That is what we call an outbreak . I don 't give a shit about your sponsors . Alright , listen to me . The Tour Cyclo Quebec is over . Oh yeah ? Watch me . Maudits Québécois . This directive is from Ottawa ? { \ Makes it } - It 's pretty official , don 't you think ? - Not in Quebec . Let 's not go there . - Mr. Sandstorm ... - Sandström . Martin Riopel . I 've been directing this race for 14 years . Riders have been sick from flu , colds , dehydration , we 've had snow . It 's all part of the challenge . - What if it 's another SARS outbreak ? - Is it ? - That 's what we ' { \ re here to } ll figure out . - { \ Well , } I 'm not canceling the race . { obody 's talking about canceling the race . } I just want to put it on hold till we know what 's going on . - Nothing is going on . - Oh really ? Mayko ! Nine riders , absent , failed to appear for the race . 27 competitors for the Tour Cyclo Quebec have been admitted to hospital . 7 patients , condition degenerating . They 're just too sick to ride . I 'd say something was going on . What do you think , Mayko ? I 'd say there 's something going on . - Ceci est ridicule ! - You said it , Martin . Oh boy ...

The MRI didn 't show any brain damage . { \ pos ( 250,260 ) } That 's what I 've been told . I consulted with your neurologist . { \ pos ( 130,260 ) } Did he also tell you that an MRI doesn 't show { \ pos ( 130,260 ) } if the synapses have stopped communicating with one another . He did . { \ And h } He believes that your neural pathways aren 't functioning as they used to . I won 't have surgery again . I can 't do it . - I just can 't go through with ... - Okay . Okay . I understand . Carlos , these are my notes on David 's report on that drug , Lefelin . He wanted you to have a read , and check the literature . { \ Okay , w } When does he go in front of the FDA ? Next week . - I 'll get on it tonight . - { \ Thanks , h } Hopefully it doesn 't put you to sleep . Rachel ? Have you heard from Wes ? No , not yet . But he should be landing in Stockholm any minute so ... Please , give him my best . I never had a chance to say goodbye . Yeah , well , you can ... You can say " hello " when he gets back . True . - Hello . - Hey , Carlos . David . How 's it going out there ? Well , we 're not the most popular scientists on the block . Je te remercie infiniment , mon ostie de niaiseux . Merci beaucoup . I 've been called an " asshole " in about ten different languages so far . - Have you been to the hospital yet ? - No , we 're still checking the riders { \ out in the field } . We should get there this afternoon . I 'll be bringing some samples back to the lab tonight . Das ist das Arschloch , daß das Rennen gestoppt hat . Danke schön . Make that " asshole " in eleven different languages . Okay , adios cabron . There , now you have twelve . Here , here 's a list of symptoms . If you have any questions ... You 're welcome . Just trying to stop an epidemic . - You don 't think that 's a good idea { \ , or what } ? - Milo . What are you doing here ? Well , the sexy outfit here doesn 't give it away ? It 's nice to see you , how are you ? I 'm good , I 'm better . - Yeah ? - And you ? What happened to Israel and Palestine and saving the world ? I had to put that on hold for a while . Yeah . I 've been training for this for 3 months now . You don 't think { \ that } we should shut down the race ? { \ Well , y } You 're the pro from NorBAC , you tell me . It 's got a lot of people worried , this thing . Especially with these SARS-like symptoms { \ that 've been reported } . - They think it 's SARS ? - No no , SARS-like symptoms . We 've still got a bunch of tests to run and people to check out . - How are you feeling ? - Rock and roll , you know . 67th out of 212 . Wow . Great . That 's like ... That 's , what ? That puts you in the top third ? Sorry , no I mean , you know , the race is young . Once we figure this out you 've got plenty of time to take that yellow jersey . { \ Right , yeah , e } Especially if these other guys keep dropping out { \ , right ? } . { \ You know , } I should probably give this to you . We 've set up an emergency checkup station in Hibbard . I 'm fine . - No , you should get checked out . { \ Come on . } - I 'm fine . Just to be safe , Milo . - Okay , Doc . - Just take it . It 's , it 's nice seeing you . Is there any chance of having that be like a personal exam ? - Yeah , I can arrange that . - Mayko ! - We gotta get to the hospital . - Dr. Sandström , how are you ? Milo Cohen . I used to come by NorBAC { \ a lot } , I was a bike courier . Actually , I came to your house once for dinner . { \ You 're t } The guy Mayko dumped ' cause you wanted to run off and join the Peace Corps { \ or something } ? It was good to see you . Call about that check-up . - Let 's go . - Different guy ? I hate uncertainty . Without { \ the } memory of your past , there will { \ always } be uncertainty about who you really are . But really we 're just talking about a 3 month period in your life . A period perhaps of some extreme physical and mental distress . I don 't know . Well , from what you told me , you 've already blacked out , hearing loss , you 've experienced sensations of falling . So , what do you suggest ? We 've already tried imipramine , hypnosis , cognitive behavior experiments . - And if surgery is off the table . - It is . Then , to be honest , you 're just gonna have to give it time . But there 's something ... I don 't have the time . I have to ... Let nature take its course , if you want , we can continue to meet weekly . What do you think about hyperbaric chambers ? Could they be helpful ? Where did that come from ? What do you think ? Well , I guess it 's harmless . Although , breathing high-pressure oxygen for an extended period of time probably isn 't a good idea . But the therapy has been approved for some specific conditions : embolisms , carbon monoxide poisoning , compartment syndrome , and other acute traumatic problems where { \ the } blood flow is reduced or cut off . - Sounds like you know more { \ about it } than I do { \ , Bob } . - If I have an infection , { \ the } high oxygen level may kill the bacteria , decrease the swelling in my brain , and may improve my memory . Maybe ... Or make it worse . They all have fever , shallow breath , chest pain , and coughs . - Mucus ? - Some rust-colored , others green . - Did you get the PCR { \ results } ? - 13 different bacteria - from 13 different riders . - Really ? And it 's not contagious ? The underlying cause could be { \ * contagious } , the bacteria could be secondary . - You 're thinking that it 's viral ? - That 's how we 're treating it . - Are the antivirals working ? - Not yet . - And it 's just in the cyclists ? - So far no locals have been infected . Alright let 's take a look . Greg Fitzimmons , 24 . - Admitted this morning . - Hey , Greg , how you doing ? Feels like I got a ton of bricks on my chest . We have him on 200 milligrams of Amantadine . Intravenous fluids . That 's about all we can do . It 's not helping . { \ Greg , } Were you sick { \ at all } before the race ? I never get sick . Have you tested for steroids ? I never use that shit . - I just can 't breathe . - Alright . Une tente à oxygène pour le patient { \ Fitzimmons } . - Tout de suite . - We 'll get you an oxygen tent , it should make it easier on you . { \ Okay , Mayko , y } You 're staying here tonight . I want everybody logged . Symptoms , treatments , medical histories , if anything new comes in , { \ you } let me know . - When are you gonna be back ? - As soon as I 've got something . Hi . I 'm Bob . This is my first time in a hyperbaric chamber . Alright , we 're at pressure . - Everybody okay ? - Okay . You okay ? Hi , Maya . Was it fun having a friend today ? You 're a real trooper . Mommy is so proud of you . Hi , I 'm Bob Melnikov . This is my first day here . Erica Browne . This is our third year at the foundation . Maya 's on her 80th dive . She 's pretty used to it . - That 's why she 's so comfortable { \ in there } . - She had an oxygen deficiency at birth . Cerebral palsy ? We 're doing great , aren 't we ? How bout you ? Yes . Fine . I { \ ' m } hope { \ that } the oxygen therapy will improve some of the memory loss that I 'm having . - It 's pretty amazing , isn 't it ? - I hope so . It 's my first day , I don 't know yet . But it certainly works for some things . That 's why we keep coming back . And you 're seeing improvement ? I mean , hoping for a miracle and not seeing the results you expected . What makes you think that we 're not seeing results ? Oh , well ... I 'm a scientist and I 've studied the clinical trial data that indicate that hyperbaric treatment has no effect on CP patients . I don 't need a clinical trial to tell me that my daughter is improving . { \ I 'm s } Sorry , { \ it 's just that } I 've done quite a bit of research . So have I , Mr. Melnikov . I realize { \ that } it 's difficult to understand all the conflicting opinions . - You 're angry . { \ Look , } I didn 't mean ... - Please don 't tell me how I feel . - I 'm sorry . - I 've seen her - getting better . - Of course ... { \ It 's just that y } Your daughter is at an age when she should be improving anyway . That 's what happens when CP kids are 6 or 7 . She 's getting better every day . Aren 't you ? Let 's go away . Bye , Maya . I just confirmed it with Dr. Chenard . You got his case history ? Manuel Danelon . Italian . Admitted after race day three . Died at 6 : 02 PM of respiratory failure . Shit . Any new patients ? Two . And one 's been in and out of a coma since he was admitted . - I 'm doing the best I can . - Okay . I 'll shoot you what we got as soon as we get something . Yeah , the sooner the better . If you aren 't too busy , I was wondering if there 's { \ was } still time for that physical ? Get in here died at 6 : 02 PM of respiratory failure . Shit . Any new patients ? Two . And one 's been in and out of a coma since he was admitted . { \ Okay . } I 'll shoot you what we got as soon as we get something . { \ Yeah , t } The sooner the better . - We all set ? - Just waiting for you . Compare these samples to all known lung infections : CAP , Eosinophilic pneumonia , everything . I want to go viral { \ on this } too . That 's where the local doctor 's heading . { \ You know , the i } Initial reports I 've been getting show enterobacter and serratia in the cyclists ' lungs . - Nosocomial infection ? { \ Where they get it } In the hospital ? - No , coming with them . { \ They 're g } Getting hospital infection while racing ? How 's that happening ? This is sounding like opportunistic bacteria taking advantage of weakened immune systems maybe damaged lungs . { \ Yeah , b } But the riders aren 't old , and they 're certainly healthy . Maybe their metabolisms are compromised . Maybe they 're getting a pre-race , at a meeting or something ? Or it 's doping ? It 's not likely . Most doping drugs actually boost the immune system . The point is , our cyclist 's immune systems are getting weakened , { \ they 're taking on } an opportunistic bacteria { \ that 's } is ripping apart their lungs . Talking about it isn 't gonna get us anywhere , let 's get to work . I think your mom is upset with me . I didn 't want her to think that she 'd made a mistake . It 's just that ... That was a very good dive , Maya . How do you feel ? A little better ? I 'm glad you 're here , Maya . I 'd be bored all by myself . Say good-bye now . See you tomorrow . Actually , no . This is our last treatment for a while . Was it something I said ? I 'm sorry , I ... We 'll be back as soon as we can . Are you okay ? I know you don 't understand , but ... I really do believe the treatments work . But they 're expensive . I know . Please don 't tell me I 'm throwing my money away . Erica , I didn 't mean any disrespect yesterday . I just didn 't want you to have false hopes about Maya . Try living with CP , see where you end up looking for hope . { \ Look , } I have a friend { \ over } at McMaster University , he 's leading a study on regenerating { \ myelin } ... Good luck ! Let 's go , Maya . What ? { \ Hey , w } Where the hell are you ? At the Adele Seward Foundation . Bob , not that fucking hyperbaric chamber shit . It 's not shit . I just wanted to let you know where I am . Everything 's fine . - We could really use you back here . - I have four more dives scheduled ... What are you , Jacques Cousteau ? David , this is very important to me . Please understand . Getting your memory back is important to me too , { \ Bob , } but if something comes up ... - I 'll be wherever you want me . - I don 't want you there . Good-bye , David . Got a minute ? Find Olivier Roth ? I need to spin the death of Marianne Wiley . Spin it ? As far as the media is concerned , we 're to blame . { \ Well , t } That 's bullshit . I got better things to do with my time than spinning . I don 't want us to look bad . She died and NorBAC , well , - we made the call on which drug to use . - Alright , here it is . We had 3 choices . All three drugs had similar mechanisms for action , the Questlogic drug had less toxicity . { \ Which means } It was the least likely to cause harm . So you 're suggesting we blame Questlogic . Nobody 's to blame , it was an experimental drug , it was Marianne Wiley 's only hope . And it didn 't work . If anything , we were asked for our opinion too late . So , you want to blame somebody , you can blame the Marines or that ... Hilliard guy for sticking his head in the sand . Alright . I can give that a try . It 's the truth , Carl . { \ I mean , } I know that 's hard for you to put out there , but gee , it just might work . How 's the book tour going ? Terrific . Flying off the shelves . In fact ... before they 're all gone , here 's a little going away present . Now go away . Thank you . I feel lucky . I look forward to reading it . Hello . You 're ringing . Your phone . Hello ? Yeah , it 's me . What ? Okay . When ? When ? What time ? - What 's going on ? - Okay , yeah , I 'll be there . The race is back on . - What ? - We 're going again at ten . No , Milo , you can 't go back there again . Mayko , I sacrificed a hell of a lot to get here . If they say it 's okay { \ to go } ... No , but they don 't know what we 're dealing with . - Look , I 'll be fine . I gotta go . - Milo , you ... I 'll be fine , okay ? Don 't go ... Wish me luck . Shit . Yeah , David . Shit . Chenard , who said it was okay to race again ? There was a committee , they met with Jean Charest . - Wanna look at the X-rays ? - Yeah . - { \ Hey , w } Welcome back . - { \ You got a } Anything new ? Not yet . Textbook . All pneumonia . All different bacteria . - Something wrong with your { \ X-ray } machine ? - Why ? What 's this ? And here ? Looks like your machine is leaking light . Well , it 's new . Could be the film or the developer ? I 've never seen this before . Maybe it 's in their lungs . Maybe something metallic ? Something radioactive ? That would definitely weaken the immune system . But we 'd see other signs . { \ Yeah , b } But still , it 's probably a good idea to get a full body X-ray . Okay . So , something airborne , maybe radioactive , got into their lungs ? { \ Well i } It could have got { \ into their lungs } there through their bloodstream . So we can 't rule out { \ that } it was something they ingested . { \ Okay , well a } All food and drink tests are negative for toxins . We can re-test for radioactivity . What about other sources of radiation ? Take a look at nuclear power plants , see if anything could have drifted here . { \ faux CP } - Also , check for metals . - Okay , we gotta track down an ... Mobile Aerosol Mass Spectrometer , perhaps ? Yeah . Hi { \ , David } . - { \ Bob , you know y } Your buddy with the Mobile Mass Spec ? - Stephen Hattman ? { \ Yeah , y } You think you can get it up here to Hibbard ? - Sure . I ... - Just get here right now , Bob . Alright . I 'll call Stephen today . Erica ? Hi , Maya . This is for you . This is a list of the most promising CP therapy trials . Supported by scientific evidence . I love that word . " Scientific " . Coffee is bad for you , then suddenly it 's good for diabete and heart disease . Echinacea does nothing , now they say it makes your cold shorter . Wine is good . No it isn 't . Is it good again ? I can 't remember . Red wine is linked to cancer prevention and the antioxidants may offer modest protection against heart disease . Do you have some kind of on-off button , where you can sound like a human being with emotion ? Or are you permanently programmed in scientist mode ? Look , science is difficult and it 's often misinterpreted , and we change our minds when new evidence is discovered . Please . I have hopes of my own . But I have to balance those hopes with faith , faith in evidence because that 's the best way to uncover knowledge . That 's why I brought these . For you . For Maya . Good-bye , Maya . Good-bye . Everything 's fine . Yeah , everyone is gone . We just have to remove the specimens and then we 're done . Yeah , we 'll talk after I talk to David , after I leave NorBAC . I 'm very excited too . I can 't wait to see you . Okay , bye . Look , start ventilating SCID mice with each of the different bacterium . - Let me know when we get any symptoms . - You think it might be airborne ? Nothing else is adding up . Okay ... Look , we know that people are getting sick with different bacteria at different times , right ? Maybe they 're all cycling through the same thing . Like some kind of poisonous cloud ? Maybe ... Look , here 's what I 'm thinking . Different bacterium have different growth rates , right ? You get sick after 12 hours from bacterium X and you get sick after 18 hours with bacterium Y , etc . - Right , so you want growth times . - Yeah . We work our way backwards , maybe we 'll find a common spot on the course where this whole fucking thing started . Let 's find out where it lives , maybe we can find out what it is . Let 's hope . I understand you 're trying to shut us down again ? I said I would tell you when you were good to go again . Vous réagissez de façon excessive . - Same to you , Marty . - No , I said you 're overreacting . I 'm told it 's not even contagious ! - We haven 't ruled that out . - Well , do you have anything ? No , this time , the race will not stop . NorBAC has jurisdiction here . Not in Quebec . Nor does Ottawa . I have the piece of paper this time . The government of Quebec says the race will continue . I don 't give a shit what the government of ... He 's one of the race officials . Oh my God , Milo ! No no no , wait wait wait ! Hold on ! Hold on ! You wanna help him , you help me , alright ? - Yeah . - Okay , let 's get back to work . Okay . Prelim analysis of the bacteria . I 'll call Hibbard . I got an e-mail from Wes . Yeah , he passed his physical . He 's strong enough to start the RNAi treatment . - That 's terrific . - Yeah . Fingers crossed , huh ? I 'm sure it 's going to be fine . You can always change your mind . About what ? Carlos has the detailed analysis of the bacterial growth curve from the first 18 cyclists , and I 'm working on the others . Thanks , Rachel . So , have you managed to shut down the race yet ? No , I 'm having some problems with the race director . We 're gonna have to do this with the science . Okay , first case , Alain Dubois . Growth time , 12 hours . Okay , what was his average speed per day of race ? About 35 kilometers an hour , 6 hours per day . 210 kilometers , 12-hour growth rate . You head out to sleep , you start at 7 , puts him back at kilometer 360 . - Okay , 360 . - Next . - Christian Buzek ... - Oh , hang on a second . Okay , this is it . You keep working on ... graphing this with Mayko . - Okay , Chrisian Buzek . - Hello . Oui . Mon nom est David Sandström . Avec NorBAC . NorBAC . Oui ... je veux parler avec ... de ministre ... du Santé ... Madame Beaudoitte , Beaudette ! Slow down . S 'il vous plaît ! { \ Look , y } You know what ? I know you speak English better than I speak French so could you { \ just } cut me some slack here ? ... kilometer 355 . Don 't give me attitude . { \ look , } just tell the Madame to cancel the race , okay ? The Tour Cyclo Quebec ! Shut it down ! Where 's Wes when you need him ? Wes couldn 't speak French either . Yeah but Wes knows you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar . Kilometer 380 , 60 , 61 ... Next ? Look at the 42nd cyclist , Milo Cohen . I figure him at about kilometer 420 . Okay , what are the numbers on the dead cyclist ? Gabriel extrapolated onset of symptoms about 30 hours . Okay , so that 's two 6-hour cycling days . Averaging 40 kilometers an hour , that 's 480 . Putting him at first contact at kilometer 380 . Which means the point of infection is approximately Tuesday , five-ish ... Kilometer 396 . Yeah , but there 's nothing really there . Well , let 's go look at nothing . So when 's it done ? It 's sampling the air all the time . It separates every airborne molecule and tells us almost instantly what they are by measuring mass and charge . Cool . Ouh , see this ? Silica particle , specific to the Sahara desert . Picked it up just now . - Here ? But that 's ... - 6,000 kilometers away . Wow , that 's crazy . Yeah , but I doubt people are getting sick from inhaling sand . Coal dust , some iron and minerals common to smelting . There 's also sodium , potassium , pollen , and some metallic particles in high concentrations . Mostly an aluminum alloy . And radioactive particles . Minute traces . Okay , so that 's negative on all nuclear power plants . The Americans have nothing to report and AEC says all CANDU reactors are clean . The rest of the world 's reactors equally pleased with themselves ? Monitoring turned up nothing . So maybe radiation got us looking the other way , and aluminum particles snuck in . But how ? From where ? { \ Well , a } Aluminum chloride is used to manufacture compact fluorescent lamps , industrial glass , water treatment chemicals , filters , fire retardant , smoke suppressant , ceramics , hip replacements ... - What isn 't it used for ? - That 's an even longer list . We 're in the middle of nowhere ! It 's got to be coming in from somewhere . So I 've sent you electron microscope images of the lung biopsy . The dead cyclist had significant amounts of aluminum chloride in his lungs . The microparticles can cause deep tissue damage . This could easily allow a portal for the bacteria , it would affect the immune system . We 've got location and time . We still haven 't found the source . - Industrial pollution ? - There 's not much up here . But we did find traces of radioactivity though . So what has aluminum chloride and is radioactive ? { \ Look , } I 'll call you back . Canadian Air Transport Security Authority reports no industrial or military leaks , explosions , you name it , they don 't know about it . DARPA 's got an upper atmosphere bacteria detection program , but they don 't use aluminum chloride . { \ So w } Where the hell is it coming from ? I 've got something . { \ Well , a } Actually three " somethings " . First , a dating on the aluminum . It 's approximately 40 years old . - How do you know that ? - Production of aluminum chloride has improved over the decades . Impurities are the key . The aluminum particles that we found had an impurity ratio of 7 to 1 , consistent with the production in the mid 1960s . Okay . 40-year-old aluminum . What else ? A dusting of sodium and potassium but I 'm not sure what 's the correlation { \ is , if any } . { \ What 's y } Your third " something " ? Elemental analysis shows that { \ the } aluminum was impregnated with carbon . { \ Okay , } So the aluminum may have been through a fire . { \ So } I looked into any chemical plants that may have gone up in flames , nothing . But get this : The carbon with the aluminum chloride particles that we found was 78 % carbon-12 and 22 % carbon-13 . Meaning ? Carbon with that ratio is never seen here ... on Earth . Little green men in space ships ? No , David . But based on the carbon ratio , it had to have come from somewhere else . There was that meteor that went down in Peru . Yes ! No ... { \ Those people } They got sick from stuff that was kicked up by impact . { \ Well , } And meteors aren 't made out of 40-year-old aluminum chloride . Shit ... Of course . So obvious . - Hey Rachel , you there ? - Yeah , I 'm still here . I 'm on hold with one of Wes ' NASA contacts . - It 's a little weird . - What ? Well , I 'm in his office and it seems awfully empty . Buy a plant . What does NASA have to say ? When are you gonna hire a replacement ? I don 't know . What does NASA have to say ? It 's a long shot , but they 're checking . Although they do admit that there 's over 4 million pounds of space junk orbiting Earth , so ... The US tracks more than 10,000 pieces of debris , anything four inches wide or larger . Everything from nuts and bolts to an old telescope . { \ Alright , well l } Let 's say we 're dealing with a 10,000 pound satellite , { \ that 's been } flying around for 40 years , { \ being } bombarded by millions of small particles from meteorites and other space shit . Those particles get fused to the satellite 's aluminum . - Nice . - So , the satellite ... loses orbit , enters the atmosphere , burns up , and releases { \ a cloud of } aluminum chloride , speckled with cosmic carbon . Right . The cyclists { \ , they } hit kilometer 396 and they pass right through that cloud . { \ And } They would have been breathing heavy from the climb . Particles get into their lungs , cause tissue damage , lower their immune systems and open the door to opportunistic bacteria . Hang on , David . Yes ? Really ? Yes I will , thank you . David ? What do you got ? So NASA did track a satellite that went down north of Nitchequon , at kilometer 396 . And when did it come down ? The night before the second stage of the race . When did it go up ? - In 1966 . - There you go . God , and NASA didn 't think to warn anybody ? - Is it one of their satellites ? - They 're still looking into it . Shouldn 't be too difficult , on average there 's only two coming down every week . Have Carlos call the local docs , let them know what we got : { \ Thing to do is to keep } they must clean out the cyclists ' lungs . That should work over time . Then call Parks Canada , have them close down the area till we can confirm { \ the } aluminum chloride is dissipated . See you soon . You mind if I stick around { \ for } another day ? { \ I 'd like to check up on that guy that I dumped . } I 'd like to know about the guy I dumped . Take a couple . Thanks . Hey , babe . - Am I too sick to kiss ? - Definitely . Otherwise you 'd be all over me , right ? No problem there . So , where do you think you wanna go ? What ? { \ Well , } You 're gonna be out of here in a day or two , I thought you might want a bit more time to convalesce . Yeah . I know a great place in the Eastern Townships . - Is there a bed ? - Yeah . And a floor . - A kitchen table . - Nice . A porch , a bathtub . A lot of places we can convalesce . Sounds sweet . You smell delicious . Careful ! What 's in that ? - Sea salt , flakes of red pepper ... - That 's not what I taste . Wanna taste again ? Oh , that 's my secret : Tequila ! There 's something else . - Get taste , taste , taste . - Wanna taste again ? Okay , give me my finger back . Now I know what I taste . You ! Well I always add a touch of Nina . Nina ... Dr. Melnikov ? Nina . We 're gonna lower the pressure for you . I know her name ! Nina ! Dr. Melnikov , just hang on ! We 're gonna get you out of there ! { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } - Yeah , I 'll be right there . - What 's wrong ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Bob had a seizure last night . You went into the chamber , ten minutes later , you 're on the floor drooling . David , I need to examine a real heart . It 's been embalmed . I can 't do anything with this ! Wes wrote up an entire protocol on organ recovery . - { \ I don 't understand } Why you { \ ' d } want to do his job ? - I don 't want to do his job . - I { \ just } don 't want anybody { \ else } to screw it up . - So you did . Listen , that was fun the other night , we should get together . You feel like flying up for the weekend ? Lefelin was designed to lower the immune response in people who suffer from autoimmune diseases . But , for an unknown reason , it raises the likelihood of congestive heart failure . Another death in a Lefelin patient . 600 dead , Mr. Riddlemeyer . What if that 's just the tip of the iceberg { \ What if } and next year it 's 6,000 ? - Lefelin will remain on the market . - That 's insane ! My wife is dying because of Lefelin ! I want that drug 's withdrawal .

 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Whoever stole the sword has other things that belong in the Warehouse , which would mean that we have competition . Lattimer and Bering , right ? They 're so raw , so untrained , so corruptible . What about your folks ? Colorado Springs . They own a bookstore called Bering Sons . Well , they must be proud of you . You ever see that movie The Great Santini ? With the tough dad and the scared kids ? It 's like that , huh ? Yeah , except it wasn 't over in two hours . Yeah , just up the street . He 's open . Oh , my . Myka ? Artie , I 'm here , in MacPherson 's apartment . Myka , be careful . MacPherson 's gone . It 's another dead end . Found him . Pete 's having better luck in Montreal . How much better ? MacPherson 's headed east on Sainte-Catherine ! Artie , I 've got the cops on me . I 'll get rid of the cops . You just stay on MacPherson . There 's an alley on the right . He 's heading for the subway . We got him , Artie . Be careful , Pete . We do not know if he has them . Artie . Give it up , MacPherson . We win this one . Artie , he has the cymbals . He has the cymbals . Pete , you got to get out of there . Just get out of there . If you see the cymbals , cover your ... Pete , Artie , what happened ? Is everything okay ? Pete ? Pete , can you hear me ? Pete ! Nevermore . Pete , Pete . Pete , you got to get up . Mom , I 'm up . And I won 't be late . I 'm okay . I managed to cover my ears . Where is he Where 's MacPherson ? He 's gone , Artie . I lost him . I lost MacPherson . Hey , Mom , listen , I 'm busy right now . I can 't really ... Myka , it 's your father . He started feeling bad , and I ... What ? Just come on home . Just come back . Just come home . We got to wrap it up . Artie , I need to go home . I 'm going home . My father 's dying . Dude . Does Tamara know you 're stalking her , or is this just for makeup tips ? Give it back , Greg . Boo-hoo , baby . Yeah , I don 't know , Leena . It 's complicated . MacPherson put decoys and bogus informational breadcrumbs ... Put them all over the world . And my software narrowed them down to two locations , and Montreal turned out to be , you know , the one that was ... Did you say you wanted no ice in your ... God , don 't do that . Mrs. Frederic , what did you do with Leena ? Sorry , would you care for a ... No . You 're here because you want to know what happened . Two policemen dead , Arthur . I know what happened . The Montreal police have a dashboard camera in the car . But I told Pete to ... He had the recording ... How did you ... Please . Look , we were following a lead . You took a shot in the dark . We hit the center of that target . With a small caliber bullet . Pete 's caliber is very large . We ... You know what ? I 'm done with this analogy . We had an agreement . You were supposed to gather information . I know . Bring it to me . Yeah . And we would plan to get MacPherson together . You had no offensive strategy , no defensive posture , no containment plan . You were not prepared . Where 's Lattimer and Bering ? Out . Manage my assets better , or I swear on the ashes of the first twelve Warehouses , I will take them away . I can get MacPherson again . I don 't doubt it . And you make no moves against him without consulting me first . Yes , ma 'am . Do you have ... How does she do that ? All right , everyone . Please close your booklets , ladies and gentlemen . Tamara , can you gather them up , please ? Okey-doke . John Steinbeck 's East of Eden . Betrayal , lost love , jealousy . Good stuff . Please read the first 50 pages for discussion tomorrow , if you would . Have a good one . Bobby , can you come here for a sec ? You okay ? You seem a little distracted . Computer lab thing . Up late . Did you talk to her yet ? I 've got something for you . " So with the world thy gentle ways Thy grace ... " Thanks , Tamara . No problem . Poetry . Burns , Blake , Byron . That 's just the B 's . Let them do the talking for you . Good luck . Mom . Mom ? Mom . Myka , hi . Hi . Your cell phone isn 't working , and I tried calling , but ... The battery died . Where is he ? He 's fine . Don 't worry . He 's upstairs . Why don 't you go up and see him ? Sorry I scared you , but he 's fine now . Hey . Hey . Yep . A wasted trip , kiddo . You bring a gun in here ? Yeah . It 's packed downstairs , disassembled . I thought you were in the hospital . I thought you were dying . Your mother overreacted . I 'm fine . It 's not a stroke ? No , no , no . Not a stroke . No , we 've got a few more tests , but , oh , God , you should have heard him screaming . I didn 't scream . I 've never screamed in my life . Do you remember what happened ? No , I don 't remember anything except waking up in the ambulance wondering what the fuss was all about . Jeannie , get the girl some food . Mom , I 'm not hungry . That 's because you 've starved your hunger nerve to death . The doctors said it might be a virus . You 're too skinny . An inner ear or a spinal inflammation . They 've got him on steroids and an anti-viral . Mrs. B. Okay , I am gonna need this recipe . The hot sauce is killer . Great . You 've got some ... Look at you . Sorry . What are you ... We 've met Pete . He 's a pip . Just got here . Met your dad . Are these yours ? I found them in the kitchen . Yeah . I 'm so sorry . They 're for collecting evidence . I 'm sorry . What are you doing here ? Well , I thought you might need the support . Artie disagreed but was overruled . By who ? By me , the pip . Well , I don 't need any support . Miss Independent , me , neither . Seriously , Dad , I 've been here for like what , a minute ? Miss Touchy , too . Oh , please , Warren . I 've got to go down to the basement . Eat something . I 'm not hungry . Well , I 'm going to get that guest room ready . And for your bed , I 've got some new flannel sheets I got at Dodi 's . No , no , no . You are my guests . It 's my house . You 're my guests . Wow . What about work ? Well , work vanished and until it reappears , I 'm here as a friend in this hopefully not-too-stressful time . I mean , it could have been worse , right ? Your dad . Thank you . I appreciate it . And you 're right , it could have been worse . Hey , wait . Wait , Myka . Myka . Myka . Yeah . I was talking to your dad . He thinks you 're still in D.C. They both do . Well , yeah , and if you tell them any differently , I swear I will drop a dictionary on your crotch . What ? I 'm supposed to tell them that I 'm working for the world 's most dangerous Antiques Roadshow ? No , you tell them the truth , or at least part of the truth . I don 't know , something to cut the stress . I 'm not stressed . You 're lying to them . It 's a force of habit , you know ? It keeps my dad from being disappointed . You have hot sauce all over your face . " ... beauty Shall be an endless theme of praise " and love " " ... gently To sleep on her breast " Deeply to sleep From the heaven of her breast " " ... tenderly kissed me She fondly caressed " and then I fell gently ... " Dad ! Mom ! Myka , get back . Watch your eyes . Warren . Warren . What happened ? What happened is your dad 's got an artifact . Myka ! Myka ! Hey ! Where 's the notebook ? It 's this way . Myka . Mom , it 's okay . Myka , who is it ? Is she ... This is Claudia . We work with her . What 's that ? That is ... Claudia , back here . That 's for me . No , you wait just a minute . I want some answers , Myka . Now , first of all , who 's the man in the little TV ? His name is Artie . And is he a doctor ? No . But ... No . Your father belongs in a hospital . This isn 't medical . Mom , this is something else . And how do you know ? You 're not a doctor . You protect the President . Not anymore . I 'm still with the government , but I am doing this now . What ? What are you doing ? I 'm trying to help Dad , Mom , so just let me do that . Trust me , please . You ready ? Yeah . Mom , just stay here . Whatever you see or hear , just stay put . But ... Just don 't move . Do you ... It 'll be okay . They do this kind of stuff all the time , so ... Claudia . I got to ... What 's going on ? They 're really good at this . Here it is . Kill it . Duck and cover . What 's happening ? Mom , how 's Dad ? He 's the same . Why ? Was something supposed to happen ? Check his arms . It 's still there . It 's ink . Ink . Take it out . Now what ? The neutralizer failed because I think we 're dealing with a bifurcated object . It 's got at least two parts , and they 're each dependent on the other . And that notebook is just one half of the package . So what 's the other half ? You know , based on the manifestations of the ink , then that would tell me that it 's a pen . Most ... Well , a pen . Anyway ... By the way , the shipper 's address ? That 's completely phony . MacPherson sent it , didn 't he ? I don 't know that . So what ? He 's coming after family now ? What does he want ? Well , he wants to hurt us because we 're going after him . Stop , stop , stop , stop . Just stop it . We don 't know who sent it or why . If it is MacPherson , it could be revenge , or mischief , or a diversion so that we 're doing this while he 's doing something else . Just in case , just to be safe , I 've ... I 'm circling the wagons around Joshua and around Pete 's family . Who or why does not matter . What matters is your father and the notebook . Now . Now , listen , I 've analyzed the text . It ain 't good . It 's Poe . Edgar Allan Poe . The reason that the book is getting under your father 's skin is because the pen is not with it . So , what ? We bring the pen together with the notebook , and this all stops ? Yeah . Well , probably if it follows a typical bifurcated artifact scenario . It can 't be an accident that this book found its way to your dad . Look , Myka , right now your father is a conduit . The notebook , the pen , they 're linked through his energy , through his love of the written word . So where is this pen ? Well , I 'm searching for coinciding incidents right now . You know , I 've got all the filters off . But it 's causing trouble somewhere . But I 'll find it . You 'll get it . The next time he has an attack , I 'll trace the pen , you 'll retrieve it and reunite it with the notebook . How long does he have ? I don 't know what you 're ... How long do we have ... What ? How long does he have , Artie ? My father can 't take this much longer . A day , maybe two . But you can help him . Until I land on something , Myka , just surround him with his books , with his world , and read to him , Myka . Read to him books that he loves , and use those words to fight what 's happening to him . And just try and keep him connected to reality if you can . Bobby 's not that bad . Look , all I 'm saying is watch out . Geek love . Ugh . " I might have been improved for my whole life . " I might have been made another creature perhaps , for life , " by a kind word at that season . " Do you want me to take over ? No . No , I 'm fine . He 's gonna be okay , Mom . I 'll be back in a sec . I 'm just gonna take these dishes . The freak 's probably swiped your panties from gym class or something . Gross . Tiger . Dad ? Tiger . Stop it . Fire . Dad ? Fire ! Dad . Help ! Somebody get some help ! Artie 's got something . What ? At the precise moment your dad was shouting , " Fire , " a kid in Portland , Oregon was burned by some bizarre wall of flame shooting from his locker . No one can explain it . Well , what about the " tiger " thing ? Kid 's a football star for the Kingford Tigers . Let 's go . Wait , Myka , I need you to stay here . I have to help my dad , Pete . I know , but we 've got two artifacts . He 's connected to one . I need you to stay on the notebook . I 'll take care of the pen . Myka , look at me . No one can help your dad right now more than you can . I can 't let you go alone . I 'll take Claudia . Keep her safe . Yeah . There 's something else . What ? I think I 'm hot for your mom . I 'll break it to Dad . Okay . I needed to speak with you , Bobby . Is everything okay ? Is the poetry inspiring you ? Not so much . You know , it seems we had a little burglary here the other day . The story is that it was one of the pens that Edgar Allan Poe used . Oh , he used it . I noticed that you were fascinated with the pen . Are you saying I took it ? You saying I took it ? I 'll tell you what , I 'm gonna go to the lounge for a soda , and if the pen should show up while I 'm gone , well , we 'll just chalk it up to something strange and mysterious . Back in a bit . Mr. Ives . Mr. Ives . No . Here . Wall ? Wall ? Wall what ? You . No . The young man 's burns weren 't serious , but they 've kept him out of football practice . He does have a reputation for scaring people . Really Does he like horror novels , Stephen King , Lovecraft , Poe ? You 're assuming the boy reads . No , he 's just a bully . Look , I mean , how big a deal is this ? I mean , the school 's got a reputation to maintain , and if it gets out that the government is investigating a teenage prank , it 'll put a lot of parents off . You mean donors ? Why do you think it 's just a prank ? Well , we 're not schooling little terrorists here . Somebody in the science class got tired of Permut picking on them and gave him a hot foot . Oh , yeah ? How 's he doing ? He 's fine . You want this open ? No , we 'll take it from here . You 'll want to step back , please . Why ? It 's not dangerous . Please . Thank you . Okay . You ready ? Why not ? Okay , we 're in business . Here we go . So , you had any other incidents ? With what ? Fire ? Well , anything strange , say a tell-tale heart , perhaps ? What ? Here we go . Got to love Artie . What 's that ? You don 't happen to have Edgar Allan Poe 's pen lying around , would you ? Well , actually ... Yes ? Mr. Ives ' classroom . He likes to collect items from famous people . The pen is here , then ? Well , was . Got stolen . This last one was the worst . I know . Dad ? If you 'd been a boy , I 'd have called you Sue . What ? Johnny Cash . It 's a song . A Boy Named Sue . Okay . Make you tough . Well , I 'm sorry I wasn 't a boy . I 'm sorry I wasn 't a father . He has regrets . About me ? Yes . About his life . What do you mean ? He wanted to write books . I know . I know that he wanted to write books . Did you know he wrote a novel ? No . Twelve times . Over and over again . Unpublished . He loved it too much to let it go . He was afraid . Where is it ? A long time ago , when he finally gave up , he told me to burn it . He hasn 't written a thing since . Come on , Pete . Mr. Ives ? Hello ? Nice place for a pen . Soaking up all that Poe juice . Wow . Do you know that ravens are actually brilliant ? They 've adapted to humans like rats and cockroaches . They figured out how to figure us out . What ? Me . Hear anything ? Just the beating of my hideous ... Stop it . Okay . Listen . What is that ? A rat in the wall ? Short story . Guy walled up . Cask of Amontillado . Of Amontillado . Here , take it off there . I don 't want avian flu . Take it ! All right . Mr. Ives ? Who did this to you ? Bobby . Find him . Stop him . Bobby , not cool . Myka , something 's wrong . Artie , I need help . What 's this ? A poem . I wrote it for you . I got to go . We 're losing him . Myka , just read to him . Read it . I have read . I 've read him everything , okay ? It 's not working . You have to find the words that he loves . You just have to find a book that means more to him than anything in the world . Mom , tell me you didn 't burn it . What ? Dad 's book . Aunt Cindy 's bureau , the bottom drawer . Okay , so Ives said that Bobby had a crush on ... What 's her name ? Tamara . Tamara . Right . There 's always a girl . What ? Don 't blame her . Blame testosterone . Crazy , crazy man hormone . I 'm not blaming the girl . I 'm blaming Poe . Bobby ? Crazy , scary man hormone . Check out Miss Teenage Zombie . Oh , right . Bobby and ... Tamara . Tamara , was it ? Right ? That 's a nice pen , Bobby . Why don 't you give it up , huh ? Come on , give it here . You 've got to be kidding me . Bobby ! I got it . Bobby , you 've got to stop this . I know you 're all full of Poe up to your creepy eyeballs , and " Nevermore " and crap , but ... But this isn 't fiction . It 's real ! This is the most real I have ever felt in my entire life . " The Blue Willow Sky by Warren Bering . Chapter One . " When the girl was born , his first thought was fear . " It 's beautiful . Bobby , you 're a good person , but you 're hurting people . You 're hurting yourself and you 're hurting Tamara , and it has to stop . People like you don 't see me . You don 't believe in me . People like you need to be shocked into seeing . You need to be horrified . Then you 'll understand . Understand what , Bobby ? Tell me what . That words have power . " For her . For his daughter . She was his life . " But this isn 't fiction . It 's real ! It 's real ! " She was his life . His only job now was keeping her safe . " She was his life . " It 's working , Myka . Words have power . Something 's happening . Go , go ! Claudia , get the pen . Who are you ? What ... One second . Nice , Claud . Here 's the bag . Get him to a hospital . This still has a hold on him . And Myka 's dad . Myka , I got it . Hey . Hey . How is he ? Is that it ? That 's it . Well , he 's not worse , but he 's not better , not completely . His strength is the only thing that 's keeping that pen from flipping completely out . Okay , the notebook 's in place . Good . Take the pen , keep it in the bag , and just , you know , approach the notebook . I 'm on it . Be careful ! I am . Would you stop yelling at me ? God , somebody turn down his volume or something . Okay , now what ? You know , put the bag right over the notebook , turn it upside down , dump the pen out . Make sure it lands on the notebook and stays there . That 's it ? Just dump it out ? Yeah . Just lay it on the notebook ? Yeah , this isn 't Cirque du Soleil . Just dump the pen on the book and stand back . All right . Artie , nothing 's happening . That 's okay . It 's all right . It 's fine . It 's been a while since they 've been together . Probably they 're just getting reacquainted . Whoa , wait , whoa , whoa . Dad ? What 's this ? Hi . Did I doze off ? Um ... Sort of . I was dreaming . You were reading , and ... You didn 't burn it . No . I did . Okay , well , I think I 've got everything . - Honey . - Yeah . Yeah , I don 't know what it is you do for a living , but you do it very well . I mean that . I 'll see you soon , and we 'll talk . We 'll talk about something other than books . Oh , Mom . Bye , honey . Thank you so much . And you take care of Pete . I always do . Hello . Hello . Got everything ? Yeah . Called the cab ? No . No , no . No , I didn 't . I think , Mr. Poe , that when your things arrive , we 'll stick them in ... Yeah . Madrid Section . That is , if Leena agrees . Arthur . Pete and Myka are in Colorado Springs . Yeah , I know . I should have tried ... And so is MacPherson . What ? How did he ... He was there the whole time . He had us all distracted . I think that was MacPherson 's intent . I 'll take the Farnsworth . Good choice . Hey , Artie . We 're heading home . Myka . Myka , listen . Myka ! That was weird . Hold on . Vibe ? Huge . Your dad . What ? Is this Poe ? Are we back into the Poe thing again ? I don 't know . You two are good . I see why Mrs. Frederic drafted you . I kill this , and it 's lights out for Mom and Dad . You hurt my father . He glimpsed the mind of one of the greatest authors in the world . He 'll thank me later . You 'll be dead later . What do you want ? I want what you risked your lives to get . I 'd have done it myself , but I lack the means . You have until the count of one . You came after family . Arthur started it . What is that supposed to mean ? Ask him . Pete . Now let them go . Do it . Thank you . Consider it a loan . What the hell was that ? Jack the Ripper 's lantern . At least we know where that is now . He used us from the very beginning . No , he used me .

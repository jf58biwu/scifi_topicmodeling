OKAY , ALL RIGHT , SEE YOU THEN . GUESS WHO 'S COMING OVER TONIGHT FOR TARANTINO MOVIE NIGHT ? BRENNAN . BRENNAN . ACTUALLY , I THINK I 'M GONNA CALL HIM . NO , YOU ARE NOT CALLING HIM . RULE NUMBER ONE , LET HIM CALL YOU . RULE NUMBER ONE ? MM-HMM . COME ON . THERE ARE A LIST OF RULES , AND THEY ARE IRONCLAD . OH , THE LIST OF RULES . OKAY , I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU READ THAT BOOK . IT IS SERIOUSLY ANTI-FEMINIST . I 'M JUST SAYING CALLING A GUY IC THE KISS OF DEATH . EVEN IF YOU THOUGHT YOU SPENT AN INCREDIBLE , MEANINGFUL NIGHT WITH SOMEBODY , AND THEY FOLLOW THAT UP WITH EIGHT DAYS OF STONE COLD SILENCE . WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? THE RULES.LET HIM TAKE THE LEAD . RULE FIVE . BE MYSTERIOUS . RULE SIX . AND DON 'T EVER SPLIT THE CHECK . RULE TEN . WOW . I MEAN , AM I ALLOWED TO VOTE OR OWN PROPERTY ? HA HA . I 'M TRUSTING YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS TO HAVE A GOOD NIGHT , OKAY ? NO SMOKING , NO DRINKING , NO DRIVING . AND MORE IMPORTANTLY , NO CALLING BRENNAN . OKAY , YOU ARE SERIOUSLY WAY BEHIND THE TIMES YOU SHOULD HAVE A WORD WITH HIM . I UNDERSTAND YOU WORKED FOR VICTOR BOOTH . I ALSO UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A WIFE . CHILDREN . THE LAST THING YOU WOULD WANT IS FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN TO THEM . WHAT 'D YOU FIND OUT ? THE SALE IS SET UP AT THE SAHRAWI EMBASSY IN PARIS . PUT A TEAM TOGETHER . THIS IS THE LAST KNOWN PHOTOGRAPH OF VICTOR BOOTH . WHO 'S VICTOR BOOTH ? HE 'S AN ARMS DEALER , AMONG OTHER THINGS . DOESN 'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY PERMANENT ADDRESS . MULTIPLE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERIES . USES DECOYS.DOESN 'T GET PHOTOGRAPHED , SO NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE . THAT IMAGE IS EIGHT YEARS OLD . THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT IT IS WE CAN SEE THE EYES . WHAT DOES BERKUT WANT WITH HIM ? KILLED ONE OF MY MEN LAST NIGHT . OUR OPERATIVE WAS SET UP AS A BUYER FOR A LIST WE REALLY NEED . SOMEHOW VICTOR GOT WIND OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS BERKUT . HE KILLED HIM AND LEFT THE CASH . WHICH WAS SMART , 'CAUSE THE BILLS WERE TRACEABLE . WE 'VE SINCE LEARNED HE 'S SET UP ANOTHER BUYER . LEARNED FROM WHO ? THE CIA . I THOUGHT CIA AND BERKUT HATED EACH OTHER . WE DO , BUT IN THIS CASE , WE 'RE FORCED TO WORK TOGETHER . WE BOTH NEED VICTOR 'S LIST . WHAT 'S ON THE LIST ? THE IDENTITIES OF CIA AND BERKUT OPERATIVES . NOW , INTEL SAYS VICTOR 'S ON HIS WAY TO PARIS . GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE SITUATION , CIA 'S GONNA INSIST THAT WE SEND SOMEBODY IN THERE WITH YOU . SO I 'M GOING TO PARIS WITH A CIA AGENT . THAT 'S RIGHT . CAN I PICK WHO ? THIS ISN 'T A KICKBALL GAME , JAIME . WELL , I JUST THOUGHT THAT , YOU KNOW , SINCE TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE , IT 'D BE GOOD TO SKIP THE GETTING TO KNOW YOU PART AND JUST HIT THE GROUND RUNNING . TOM GILCHRIST AND I SEEMED TO GET THE JOB DONE LAST WEEK . OKAY , YOU WANNA CALL HIM ? NO , YOU GO AHEAD . I DON 'T CALL GUYS . YOU 'RE MISSING THE POINT , JAIME . REALLY ? ' CAUSE I THINK I JUST KICKED YOUR ASS . DISCRETION . YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO NEUTRALIZE THE ENEMY IN PUBLIC WITHOUT ANYONE EVER SEEING . ONCE YOU 'RE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD , YOU 'LL LOSE ALL VALUE AS A WEAPON . YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE MOST ? BEING REFERRED TO AS A WEAPON . YOU ALL RIGHT ? HI . TOM.JAE. GOOD LUCK . LONG TIME . NINE DAYS . SO YOU READY FOR PARIS ? YEP . BY THE WAY , THANKS FOR CALLING ME OUT IN THIS . OH , I DIDN 'T CALL YOU.JONAS CALLED YOU . OKAY , SO HERE 'S THE PLAN . WHEN WE LAND IN DE GAULLE , WE GOTTA MOVE FAST . OH , DE GAULLE , HA HA . I HATE PARIS . IF I 'M BEING HONEST , I JUST--I DON 'T GET THE ALLURE . I 'VE NEVER BEEN . YOU HAVEN 'T ? OH , IT 'S THE MOST ROMANTIC PLACE IN THE WORLD . YOU 'RE GONNA LOVE IT . REALLY . YEAH , ROMANTIC . YEAH , MY PARENTS TOOK ME THERE WHEN I WAS 12 . 15 CHURCHES AND FIVE MUSEUMS IN ONE DAY . GUN , MOUTH . THE LOUVRE , DON 'T DO IT TO YOURSELF . NATHAN , CAN WE CONCENTRATE ON THE CASE ? LET 'S GET DOWN TO IT . ALL RIGHT , JAE , YOU AND I WILL TAKE NATHAN TO THE SAFE HOUSE AND WE 'LL SET UP SHOP WITH THE RESTOF THE CIA TEAM . MEANWHILE , TOM AND JAIME , YOU 'RE GONNA ASSUME YOUR COVER AND CHECK INTO THE HOTEL . HOW DID BERKUT FIND VICTOR ? LAST WEEK , ONE OF OUR TOP OPERATIVES MADE CONTACT . HE WAS KILLED TRYING TO BUY THE LIST . VICTOR MEANS BUSINESS . HE 'S SOLD NAMES BEFORE . THE THREE OPERATIVES ON THE LAST LIST WERE ALL DEAD 48 HOURS AFTER IT WAS SOLD . AND IF OUR INTEL IS CORRECT , THERE 'S OVER 100 NAMES ON THIS LIST . WHICH MEANS WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT ONLY AMERICAN SECURITY , BUT THE IMMEDIATE SAFETY OF OVER 100 MEN AND WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES . SO IF WE CAN GET THOSE NAMES , WE CAN PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE . SO IS THE SALE DEFINITELY GOING DOWN TONIGHT ? THE ONE THING THAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS IT 'S HAPPENING TONIGHT . AND WE NEED TO GET A POSITIVE ID ON VICTOR FROM AMONG 200 TO 300 GUESTS . SO YOU TWO HAVE TO EYE MAKE CONTACT AS MANY EUROTRASH TOOLBAGS AS YOU CAN . AND WE 'LL TAKE CARE OF THE REST AT THE SAFEHOUSE . ALL RIGHT , WE BRING VICTOR INTO CUSTODY AND WE KEEP THE LIST FROM GETTING INTO ENEMY HANDS . LET 'S GO DO IT . SOUNDS GOOD . HEY , LET 'S KEEP IT PROFESSIONAL , YOU TWO , HUH ? YOU EVER SEEN BREATHLESS ? JEAN-LUC GODDARD ? NO . I BET YOU HAVEN 'T SEEN A SINGLE MOVIE MADE BEFORE 1983 . THE BREAKFAST CLUB ? THANKS FOR PLAYING . WE HAVE SOME LOVELY PARTING GIFTS . HOW CAN I HELP YOU ? WE NEED TWO ROOMS . I 'M HERE WITH MY WIFE . BUT I 'M MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER . - I WAS IN TURKMENISTAN ... - I DIDN 'T KNOW YOU SPOKE FRENCH . NO , NO , YOU GO AHEAD . THAT 'S WHY I DIDN 'T CALL . BAD SERVICE ? WHO 'S YOUR CARRIER ? I KNOW--IT SOUNDS LAME , DOESN 'T IT ? NO , NO , IT SOUNDS REALLY IMPORTANT . WELL , IT WAS IMPORTANT . BUT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT , RIGHT ? SAVING LIVES , NATIONAL SECURITY , THAT KIND OF THING . I MEAN , YOU 'RE IN THE GAME TOO , RIGHT ? SURE . YEAH . C 'EST LA VIE . I GATHER I 'M MADAME LODATO .

OH , WAIT , I CAN 'T TELL YOU WHERE I GOT IT , ' CAUSE THEN ... NO , DON 'T SAY ... I HAVE TO KILL YOU . ... BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO KILL ME . ALL I NEED TO KNOW IS WHETHER THIS WILL EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY VICTOR . JAIME NEEDS TO LOCK ON TO PEOPLES ' EYES . ONCE SHE DOES , THE PROGRAM CONVERTS THE DETAILS OF THE IRIS STROMAL PATTERN INTO A BIT PATTERN , AND I CAN CROSS-REFERENCE . ONCE I AFFIRM THE MATCH , I APPRISE AGENT SUMMERS SO THAT SHE CAN DETERMINE THE MEANS TO EXTRICATE THE MARK TO THE JIMJAM . YOU REALIZE THAT SPIES DON 'T REALLY TALK THAT WAY . I KNOW.IT BLOWS . I 'M JUST TRYING TO BRING BACK THE COOL . ANYWAY , IF JAIME MEETS VICTOR 'S EYES , WE 'LL FIND HIM . VICTOR 'S ALTERED HIS APPEARANCE NUMEROUS TIMES . EVEN IF VICTOR HAS GONE VICTORIA , THE PROGRAM IS AIRTIGHT . OKAY , THIS BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGY MAKES PHOTOSHOP LOOK LIKE PONG . UNPRECEDENTED FALSE RATE MATCH . LIKE , NEVER .

I DOUBT YOUR OPERATIVE CAN GET 200 CAPTURES DURING THE COCKTAIL PARTY . I DON 'T KNOW , OUR GIRL IS PRETTY GOOD . DUDE , DON 'T ... DON 'T TOUCH MY STUFF . THERE 'S A LOT OF SECURITY , BUT WE KNEW THAT . YEAH , PACKING SEMIAUTOMATICS OUTSIDE THE EMBASSY IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL . IF THEY 'RE DOING THAT . ARE THEY ? THEY ARE . SO WHAT 'S THE EMBASSY PARTY FOR , ANYWAY ? ENVIRONMENTALISTS . I DIDN 'T KNOW ENVIRONMENTALISTS LIKED TO PARTY . HEY , IF WE I.D. VICTOR BEFORE 8 : 00 , CROISSANTS ON ME .

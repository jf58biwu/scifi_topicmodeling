 " Destiny ... " The design is clearly Ancient , launched hundreds of thousands of years ago . Where the hell are we ? Several billion light-years from home . We 're on a ship , but we have no idea where we are , in relation to earth . This ship could be the most important discovery mankind has made since the Stargate itself . These are the wrong people in the wrong place ... We 've got a lot of wounded , and we need to get home . We barely have enough power to operate the main systems . This ship simply doesn 't have the capability to dial earth . We 've got a problem . One of the air vents just shut down in here . Our first priority must be to seal off any of the leaks . We can maybe buy ourselves a day or so before the build-up of co2 kills us . We can 't ask someone to sacrifice themselves , period ! Dad ! No ! Wait ! - It looks like we 've dropped out of ftl . - The ship detected a Stargate on a planet within range that may have what we need . What we need 's on the other side of that wormhole . Hot . Cool . Make sure we can dial back to the ship . Already on it . - Looks like gypsum . - That would be good . Why ? - We 're looking for calcium carbonate . - Calcite . Gypsum is calcium sulphate , which is 36 % calcium carbonate . Huh . It dissolves . You saying we can use this sand to fix the scrubbers ? - That would be convenient . - No . It 's a fair indication that the components may exist nearby . For the sake of portability and efficiency , I 'm hoping to find high-concentration granular limestone . We are looking for the dried lake bed or salt-water body all this sand came from . It 's a desert . Lime is formed mostly from the remains of marine organisms . Are you saying there was life here ? Not likely anything we 've seen before . Yeah , the water may be gone now , but this desert was formed by h2o evaporating on a playa floor , causing gypsum to be deposited in a fine crystalline form called selenite ... Where 're you going ? Higher ground . What 's supposed to happen ? If this sand is high enough in calcite concentration , the solution would absorb the acid . - Right . - The liquid would turn clear . It 's not . We 're good ! This is scott . Unfortunately , there 's nothing useful in the immediate vicinity of the gate . You have 12 hours , lieutenant . Make 'em count . Copy that . We 're moving out ! Too bad we can 't just use this sand . There certainly is enough of it . I 'm fine . No , you 're not . And neither am I , but we 're , uh ... We 're still alive because of what he did ... - For what it 's worth ... - It 's worth a lot . And , you know , as long as we 're still here , I promise you ... Colonel , I 've edited enough of my father 's speeches to know what you 're going to say , and ... You don 't have a clue what I was going to say , because I don 't . We , um ... We brought along , um ... an Ancient device , communications stones , they allow us to ... Yeah , I know what they are . Good , I 'm about to use one of them to report to my superiors on Earth , tell them our situation . I want to tell her myself . You 've been sitting here since rush made contact . Let somebody else take a shift . I 'm not leaving this chair . I 've been on this project for the last six months , and I 'll be damned if I ... Colonel ? This is strange ... Dr. Rush , is that you ? No , it 's colonel Young and I need you to put me in a room with general O 'Neill . And I 'm going to need you , too . Sir , I told you not to get up ! What did he do to himself ? He 's got cracked ribs , more bruises than I can count , and a concussion that resulted in neuropraxia . Oh , that 's just great . Chloe ? - Dr. Mehta . - Can you help me , please ? You know , I had some of my favorite arguments with your father . Are you saying you won some ? Depends on who you ask . Listen , uh ... major Green 'll be escorting you to see your mother . Please ... give her my condolences . Thank you . So how is it going out there ? Really . I don 't know what Rush has told you . We may not have much time left . The ship 's very old , falling apart . - Fix it . - We 're trying . Even if we can get the life support working , - we don 't have much food and water . - Then go get some . We 're not supposed to be there , sir . These are the wrong people in the wrong place , and , as a group , they 're just not qualified . Oh , please . Ai wasn 't qualified to lead that first team through the Stargate ... - I understand that , sir . - In the past dozen years or so , we 've sent hundreds of teams through that thing ... and , the bottom line is ... none of us are qualified . I just think we 're going to get to a point very soon where everyone on board should get a chance to say goodbye . Understood . Save it . That 's not very smart . Temperatures like these , the human body needs at least ... Walk , don 't talk . Fust fyi , He 's right about the whole human body and water ... Eli ! Walk , don 't ... right . Oh . Look . More sand . This is pointless . We should go back . We just got here . I still think we should be checking out the other planets in range of the ship . I still think you 're wrong . The solution 's here . I know it was a mirage , but when we were walking over that last dune ? I thought I saw the statue of liberty sticking half out of the sand ... Just for a second there , I was all ready to yell ... " Damn you ! " Damn you all to hell ! " Oh , come on ! That was funny . Was it ? Because ! It would mean we were really on earth , but in the future ... and the apes had taken over ... and then buried - the Statue of Liberty for some reason . - Eli ? Have a drink . Greer , hold up ! Hold up ! - This isn 't going to work . - Not if we keep stopping . I 'm saying we need to split up . Fine with me . I agree . Franklin , you should come with me . Nah ... No , no , no , you 're with me and greer . Sun 's been moving that way , we 'll call it west ... Eli , Franklin , Palmer ... and Curtis , - You head that way . - We 'll test every 20 minutes or so . After two hours , you head south-east ... that should take you back - in the direction of the Gate . - Whoa , wait a second . Do we really think that splitting up is the best idea ? I say we head straight back . There 's no point in crossing over the same territory we 've just crossed . Or ... we could just stick together . Look , Matt ... I 'm sorry , I just have this really ... really sick feeling that you 're going to go that way ... and we 're going to go this way ... Eli , I need someone that I can trust to lead the second team , okay ? That is you . Curtis is a good soldier , he 's a tough guy . He 's not going to let anything happen to you . Truth is , I 'm slowing you down , and you want to get rid of me . I 'm doing what i think will best accomplish this mission . You asked to come . I 'm telling you how you can help me . Now suck it up . Yeah . Okay . Okay , guys , we 're going this way . Move out ! Radio if you find the lake bed , we 'll double back . When you see the statue of liberty , you know what to say , right ? Right . Now we can make some time . She 's here ? Right now ? - Yes , ma 'am , but as I 've explained ... - Chloe ! Mrs. Armstrong ... I know I look different , and I sound different but it 's me . Mom , please . I have something to tell you . Mom ... Stop ! I 'm sorry ... it 's just ... The thought that you 're actually on some ship ... so far away , i can 't even imagine . - Mom ? - Just tell me you 're coming home ? I don 't know ... Mom , please ! The ship is old and damaged . We were losing air and somebody had to ... He 's dead . He 's dead , isn 't he ? Where is everyone ? Able bodies are searching the ship for anything that might have co2-sequestration properties , and the rest are in crew quarters . Colonel , we were able to dial out to the planet again . Colonel , Young and Chloe are using the communication stones . This is colonel Telford and Dr. Mehta . O ... Right , okay . Did you make radio contact with the off-world team ? Uh , yes , nothing to report yet . They 've split up . How much time before the ship jumps back to ftl ? Roughly nine hours . Dial out every 20 minutes . Maintain regular contact . We do have power issues to be aware of . Dialing the gate is a significant drain on what seems to be limited resources at this point . The away mission is priority one right now . - Sir ? - I 'm fine . I understand that there are other Stargates in range ? Four other addresses came up in the system , but we seem to be locked - out from here . - Have you tried working around it ? Dr. Rush didn 't think that was a good idea . I think it makes sense to know what our options are . Do what you can . There has to be a good reason why these addresses are being disqualified . If I wasn 't being clear , I was giving you an order . If there are good reasons , find out exactly what they are . Let 's keep moving , I want to see more . - You should rest . - Lieutenant . Sir , colonel Young 's body needs time to recover . - Give me something for the pain . - The body feels pain for a reason . - I would rather not mask it . - Just do it , lieutenant . From the sounds of things , you need my help here . All right , come on . Let 's go . You better save some of that . - We need to slow down . - We need to cover more ground . It 's going to be impossible to maintain this pace on the way back . Maybe for you . How tedious ... Little boys playing " soldier . " I 'm sorry , I 've no interest in playing that game . I 'm not playing anything , I 'm trying to save the lives - of everyone aboard that ship . - if you continue at this pace , - we 're going to die out here ... - Then maybe we will . ... Light-years away from the admiring eyes of your father , or your drill sergeant ... Or whoever 's approval it is you so desperately seek . - How dare you ! - Get up and move . Did you see that ? What ? I don 't know ... Nothing . Let 's move . One hour ... One hour , and then we start circling back . All right , fine . - Just hold that there . - Thank you . What did you give me ? That was supposed to be for the pain . What did you give to him ? A strong sedative , which we are short on and I should not have had to use just so that colonel Young can return to a body in working condition . You are out of line , lieutenant . Disregarding the health of another human being is out of line . I am well within my rights as ranking medical officer . He 'll be out an hour or two . Well , what am I supposed to do ? I don 't care . I have other patients to attend to . Something wrong ? No , I 'm fine . Good a place as any to stop and test . I take it that 's not good ? No . I don 't now , I think ... Hey , guys . Another negative over here . I 'll radio Scott and tell him we 're moving on . Uh , yeah , but ... that 's not what 's going down . - It 's not ? - No . There are four other viable addresses in this thing . I think I found an override that 'll allow us to dial from here ... - Yeah , but ... - Look around . - This planet is a dead zone . - But ... We should 've been trying to dial these other planets from the start . - Rush said ... - We don 't care what rush said . We don 't trust him . Rush doesn 't want us all to die . That doesn 't mean we trust him to make the right decisions . You too ? What about the lake bed ? It could be hundreds of miles from here . We could be blowing our only chance of finding a decent place to evac . Maybe the ship did bring us here because there 's lime on this planet . For all we know , the ancients had a way of locating it that we don 't . For that matter , I 'm sure they could 've stopped the ship for longer than 12 hours or longer than 12 hours to find it and recover it with the proper tools . The fact is , the Ancients wouldn 't have let the life-support system get that screwed up in the first place . Rush is set on fixing the ship . He 's deaf to any other logic . We need to find a planet we can survive on . This might be our last chance . Gotta keep goin ' . Here . Take it . - I have my own . - No , no . I can 't go on . I 'm never going to make it back . I know it 's here . You have to find it . Take it . - We 're going to leave him here ? - I 'll make my way back to the Gate . - Go with him . - I 'm not leaving you here alone . - Make sure he gets back alive . - What difference does it make ? Because if I don 't find what we need , he 's going to be the one to find some other way to save his own ass and yours along with it . You 're losing it . I 'll be okay . Scott , this is eli . Come in ? If you can hear me , please respond . This is scott , what 's up ? We have a problem . Franklin , Curtis and Palmer have given up and are headed back to the gate to try dialing the other addresses in the remote . They also have the kino . They don 't think we 're going to find the lime here . They want to look for another planet that will support life . - They 'll get themselves killed . - Don 't we need that remote - to get back to the ship ? - That 's not the point . A few hours is nowhere near enough time to determine whether a planet is even safe , let alone viable for sustaining life . The ship ... The ship 's our only real hope of ever getting home . Stop them if you can . I 'll turn back when I have to . - Yes , sir . - Go ! You lead . I 'm sorry , excuse me . Miss Armstrong , we 've got to get going soon . You get my daughter home . Everyone is doing the best they can , I assure you . - That 's not good enough . - Mom , it 's not his fault . I 'm a personal friend of the president and of the first lady . - Yes , ma 'am . - You tell your superiors that if anything happens to her , I will go public with what i know . Mom ... I 'm sorry , she 's upset . My husband ... gave his life for my daughter . You get her back to me , or the whole world is going to know what has really been going on these past years . - I need water . - We 're almost there . I thought since I gave Scott my canteen , we 'd share . And you were wrong about that . Yeah , i should 've known . Yeah ? You think you know me pretty well , don 't you ? I helped choose the personnel for icarus base . I read your file . And neither you nor captain marvel were on my list , let me tell you . You think I care ? Give me some water . Keep walkin ' . You think , just because you were born poor , that it gives you the right to be angry at the world , how pathetic . Yeah ? You think that 's why I 'm " angry ? " If it wasn 't for the army , you 'd be in jail , or worse . - That 's what all you rich people think . - Rich ? My father worked in a shipyard in Glasgow I earned a scholarship to Oxford while I was working two jobs . I have got a right to make decisions without explaining myself to you or anyone else . You give me some of that water ! Keep walkin ' . You give me some of that ... Don 't you ever touch me . Give me some ... And you do that again , and I 'm gonna put a bullet in your face . Oh , really ? I don 't think so . You need me . Otherwise , you 'd have gladly done it by now . Right now , I pray to the god above that dehydration will shut you the hell up . Walk ! Or die here ! It 's your choice , mister ... " ... decision-maker . " Looks like it 's worth a shot to me . Let 's do it . Wait ! - Stop ! - Look , it 's not perfect , but it 's better than here . Vegetation , water , air ... It 's not too late for you to come with us . No , no . We 'll dial back when we know it 's safe to evacuate everyone . - You 'll never get back home . - You don 't know that . Maybe there 's a way to use the Gate system to connect the dots . There has to be a reason the ship locked out those addresses ! Don 't . Please ? Shoot him ! Why did you do that ? He told me to . - We saved his life . - By shooting him ? He 'll live . You just stranded Curtis and Palmer . We 'll send them another remote . I wasn 't taking any chances . - Where 's Scott ? - Still looking for limestone . It 's almost half-time . We only have six hours before the ship leaves . Lieutenant , this is Greer . Come in . I hope he 's turned back by now . Lieutenant ! Come in . You must keep going , my boy . Don 't give up . I don 't need you to tell me that . I 'm not going to let anyone else down the way I let you down . You really don 't have to follow me around to remind me . He has his plan ... for all of us . He 's either out of radio range or he 's lying face-down in the sand , dead , or soon-to-be . I 'm going back for him . Well , that 's great ... suicide . I 'm not leaving him out here . - I go with you . - No , you just gonna slow me down . This man has to get back to the ship . He needs medical attention . Dial . He can take Franklin back . You wait here for me . You have five hours to find him and get back here . It has not been a pleasure knowing you . - What do I need that for ? - Just in case . In case what ? Hey , I don 't even know how to fire this thing . You 'd better be here . I will . I have a gun . Why do I feel like I 've been drugged ? - Good to have you back , sir . - Son of a ... What the hell was Telford doing ? You 're going to need this . - There they are . - Hurry up , hurry up . Come on , help him , help him . What happened ? Greer ... Greer shot him . Water ? That was my ration for the day . What 's going on ? Oh , we 've had a lovely day at the beach . How about you ? I have sinned , father . I 've failed you . I 've failed him . I 've failed myself . We have redemption through his blood . Curtis ? Palmer ? This is Eli . If you can hear me , please come in . Curtis . Palmer . Please , respond . Do you love her ? She 's not going to have it . You 're sure ? She 's 16 . We barely even know each other . What are you going to do ? I don 't know ... about anything . I thought ... he was my calling . But now ... I am sorry . Why ? I 'm the one who 's weak . It 's my fault . No ... It isn 't . It 's not yours . This is scott ! Come in ! I found it , I found the lake bed ! I 've got the lime ! Oh , my god . If y-you can hear me , wait ! Just wait , I 'm coming ! Eli . Which way ? Move out . Scott ... Drink . Come on ... come on . Come on , man . Come on . Take the bag ! There 's no time ! - You have to take it . - Yes , you can . No , I can 't make it ... Get the hell up ! Come on ! I can 't make it . I can 't carry you and this ! Get your weak ass up ! Come on ! Come on , soldier ! Less than three minutes before the ship jumps again . Incoming ! I 'll stay . It 's okay . I got it . Sorry , sir . You did your best . Less than one minute . I see them . I see them ! They 're carrying something ! We 've got it ! Don 't go ! We 've got it ! They 've got the lime ! And they 're not going to make it . 40 seconds . Give me the radio . Eli , I want you to stick your arm into the event horizon of the puddle . Seriously ? Are you sure ? No . But I 'm betting there 's some kind of a safety protocol prevents someone - being cut-off en route . - But what if there isn 't ? 20 seconds . Eli , do it now ! Come on . Come on ! Five ... four ... three ... two ... one . Eli . Drink . Scott , look at me . Lieutenant , look at me . Look at me ! Look at me . Well done , Eli . Well done . * In the quiet of the shadow * * In the corner of a room * * Darkness moves upon you * * Like a cloud across the moon * * You 're a-wearing all the silence * Look . * Of a constant that will turn * * Like the windmill left deserted * * Or the sun forever burn * * So don 't forget * * to breathe * * Don 't forget to breathe * * Your whole life is here * * No eleventh-hour reprieve * * Don 't forget to * * Breathe * * Keep your head above water * * But don 't forget to breathe * I brought you some water .

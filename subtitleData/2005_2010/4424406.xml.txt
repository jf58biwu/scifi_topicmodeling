 Previously : This is Rufus . Jen , what are you doing ? You 're not supposed to keep those embryos . You 're just gonna have to kill it . I know . I know . Do you have any ... ? I 've had a vasectomy . So you 're pregnant . What are you gonna do ? Tell me about the risks with the pill . Give me odds . One in a thousand women have difficulties . If you decide that you want to move forward , then you give me a call . Do you ever think about a family ? Someday . You know I want babies with you , don 't you , Rol ? Plenty of time for that when you get back . Evram ? SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE MISSILES FIRE No ! Hey ! Hey , Evram . Evram , you OK ? You 're right here . We 'll just keep it between you and me then . You don 't have to look , you know . I 'm fine . Just do it . Nothing to be ashamed of . A lot of people have trouble with blood . Can we not make a big deal about it and just get it done ? Make a fist . At home , going to the doctor can be a little scary . But there are special challenges to medical care in the micro gravity of space . Come on . Oh , for instance , fluid handling can be very difficult , right , Dr Mintz ? Can you explain this process to the fleet back on Earth ? It 's just a routine blood test , Paula . Needle in , needle out . But we all know there is nothing routine about space . HE SIGHS Damn it . Missed . HE GROANS OK , Paula , enough . Yeah , do they have you do thisjust to piss us off ? I 'm the payload specialist . I 'm the pilot of the Venus Lander , and I 've also been chosen to document this voyage for classrooms across the world . It 's my job , OK ? All right , well , right now your job and my job seem to be in conflict . So why don 't we try this another time ? Fine . Thank you . Another time then . 'Mintz once told me he couldn 't remember 'a single person he saved when he was a surgeon . 'He could recall cases , diseases , wounds . . . ' Almost done . 'But he forgot the people . ' You can look now . 'When I asked him why , he said it was simple - 'there are no lessons to learn from the ones you save , 'no reason to remember . ' Keep your hand there . BEEP 'Lessons are taught by the ones you lose . ' All right , listen up . This is not a blow-off day . It 's not a field trip . Welcome . All right ? Sorry . Sorry . Traumatic injury and illness happens . It happens here . It happens in space , with one major difference . Wassenfelder , what 's the major difference ? Um ... It ... That 's what I thought . Wake up , genius . What 's the difference , Dr Mintz ? On Earth , you gate 9-1-1 . Whereas on Antares ... We only have each other to rely on . And if you can 't rely on each other , what happens , Dr Winkler ? You die . That 's right . You die . Dr Winkler 's obviously been hitting the doughnut cart lately . Yeah , anything to keep the baby happy . But at one time she was a member of the illustrious Ostriches which means an ASCAN classmate of mine and a very , very , very good one . She 's running the ER here at Koop and has agreed to be our chaperone for the day . All right , I want you to form three groups in front of the doctors - Dr Mintz , Dr Winkler and Dr Dereux . Let 's go . Fall in . WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA So you ASCAN 'd with Donner , huh ? Yeah , and homeboy hurls at the sight of blood . HE LAUGHS No kidding . Oh , yeah . Class of ' 42 , baby . The only question is how long before he goes down ? Ah , I got 20 , says he doesn 't make it past lunch . Yeah . He 'll be lucky to make it to 11 : 00 . You in ? All right . Take one , pass it back . MINTZ LAUGHS Take one , pass it back . Pass it back . Take one , pass it back . Yeah . OK , we 're ready . Let 's head out . That wasn 't too obvious . You think he saw ? No , you were smooth as silk . Now you 're with Dr Pregnant . So I heard you did your residency in Tel Aviv . Yeah , after the war . I was at , uh , Richardson in Montreal . To be honest , I kind of miss it . I don 't . OK , so we 're gonna split you guys into groups and assign individual cases . Uh , oh , Dr Mintz , why don 't you and Donner take your group into this bay here ? It 's a little lawn mower accident . MAN MOANING IN DISTANCE , HE GASPS I 'm gonna go down to the lobby , check for stragglers . Mm . Almost . SHE CHUCKLES BEEPS HE SIGHS Coming down with something ? Doctors don 't get sick . Uh-huh . Is that according to sick doctor ? I consult with Claire . Who 's objective when it comes to you , huh ? She is a medical professional . Hey , Ev , don 't play me , all right ? Took you six stabs to find a vein . HE SIGHS My back 's been acting up since we left Earth 's orbit . I 've been getting strange reactions to the pain medication . That causes the shakes ? Among other things . I 'm trying to find the right dosage . All right . Roger that . HE SIGHS INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA BEEPS Mintz have a fever ? I didn 't see that on last night 's 0-11 . Low-grade . I just noted it , Mike . Hey . He 's back . INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS You look good . Welcome home . Thank you , Dr Goss , for allowing my return to the floor . Welcome back , Sharma . Everyone 's very happy you 've made a full recovery . I 'm humbled to be part of the family again . Yeah , well , you just hold on to that humility when the press wants your story . I was briefed by Eve Shaw . " No comment " is your default setting . You copy that ? Yes , sir . No comment at all . KNOCK ON DOOR Hey . Hey . Do you have a few ? Could you help me with something in the lab ? New experiment ? You could say that . Mysterious . Mm , slash cute and fuzzy . Close that hatch . BEEP OK , this is all a little skulky . Are we doing weird science ? Mm , nothing weird , but definitely skulky . May I present ... Rufus . OK . Yeah , not so cute . Or fuzzy . Give him time . Aren 't you supposed to destroy rabbit foetuses after ten cell divisions ? Well , yes . But today 's his birthday , and I need your help . What , baking a cake ( ? ) Giving him birth . This is Mr Gurwitz , dislocated shoulder . These are our astronauts . Hey . MOANS Here we go . Oh , I know . OK . So you were in Donner 's class ? Yeah . Yeah , until I realized I 'd make a better doc than a sky walker and I dropped out . Ah . There we go . Oh , I 'm sorry . I know it hurts . Uh , lido patch , please . Oh . You 'll have these on Antares . They 're a localised lidocaine anesthetic , and they work ... HE STOPS PANTING . .that fast . It 's excellent , huh ? OK . We 're gonna brace him . There we go . Donner was my partner when I did my ASCAN Rounds , which meant I pretty much did them alone . Do tell . Oh , well , you know about the blood thing . No . Blood thing ? You didn 't see him run away out there ? Oh . It 's the only thing I 've ever seen Donner wimp out on , which is what makes it so much fun . Everyone ready ? CRACK Oh . Excellent . OK ? OK . I gotta pee . Little bugger is crushing my bladder . Go , people . You know what ? Don 't let Dr Mom there give you second thoughts . It 's too late for second thoughts . It 's done . I took the pill this morning . What ? Then , Zoe , you shouldn 't be here . It 's done . I took the pill this morning . What ? Then , Zoe , you shouldn 't be here . I 'll be home before the cramping starts , and tomorrow it 'll be like it never happened . OK . Russell Zachary - high as as kite and under police investigation . SLURRED : No , you can 't have me arrested without a positive test . You know that . I know that . So ... Yeah , apparently this is a new designer drug moving down the coast . Its , um , molecular structure is designed to basically disappear into your system . Untraceable ? Mm . That 's genius . It 's not genius . It 's illegal . OK , so check his vitals every 15 until his blood work comes back . You know , sometimes a trace shows up . Wait . I mean , is that all we could do ? Yeah , Paula . Sometimes medicine can be dull . Get over it . She 's so hot . Do you get high , miss ... Don 't talk to me . We are now 30 days into our voyage , a little over a week and a half from insertion into Venusian orbit . LAUGHTER And I have the honour ... You said " insertion " . LAUGHS AND SNORTS I have the honour of piloting the Venus Lander . So I 'm really starting to get excited . Insertion makes her excited . HE LAUGHS This is an amazing adventure that I feel truly blessed to be a part of . And you can be a part of it , too . All you have to do is tune in . From Antares , I am Paula Morales . Until tomorrow . You are such a jerk . Why ? Cos I don 't say a prayer every time we 're near a new planet or blow a kiss to Christ after reform 24 ? There 's nothing wrong with living my religion . Spectacles , testicles , wallet and watch , please , Father , forgive me ... Lock it down , Wassenfelder . You two , come on . I have a job for you . HE GROANS Okay , go long . HE BLOWS Dragon 's breath . Nice hands . You better say an end zone prayer now , Morales . I 'll say a prayer for the moron who threw the pass . You know why he 's making us do this , right ? Yeah , we work together . We form a friendship . Commander Ted 's sweat bonding . " If you love only those who love you , " what reward is there in that ? " Sweat bonding through Jesus - that 's the worst . ( LAUGHS ) No , Matthew 5 : 46 . Why do zealots never understand irony ? Paula ! Steven ! HELICOPTERS WHIRRING GUNFIRE , MISSILES FIRE SCREAMING Aah ! HE GRUNTS Zoe , mask . Seriously ? Just think of it as a sociological experiment . Bonding with pets in space . Why invest in something when you cannot keep it ? That 's not true . I am gonna nurse this beauty all the way back to earth . Look at that . This is the first real birth in space . Isn 't it amazing ? It looks like a ... Tiny , floating penis with teeth . Hand me that aspirator . What is the matter with you ? What is the matter with me ? What if mission control finds out ? I turned off the camera . And Rollie knows . Rollie knows . Rollie knows , and he didn 't say anything ? Not yet . It 's against protocol , Jen . It 's one rabbit , Zoe . Relax . ALARM BLARES " TED : We have a man down in storage bay . Code 3 . Code 3 . " I wonder who . Come on . You gotta go . We gotta go , Jen . Yeah , I 'll be there . I just gotta put him away . Do we know who ? Paula . Ohh . Whoa ! There was an accident . The-the container pinned her , and the hatch door came down . She 's got no thumb ! She 's got no thumb ! Yeah , apply pressure . Steven , press down hard . She 's got - Okay , flight , we 've got a severed thumb and a-and an additional , uh , abdominal injury . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God . That 's it , Wass . We got to get her up to the natural grav quick . She 's losing a lot of blood . Does anybody have a 20 on Mintz ? In his quarters . Well , let 's get him over to the med station . Clear the floor of everyone but critical personnel . And cut the press feed . Tell them we 'll brief them on the half-hour . Ev , they need you now . " CLAIRE : Evram ? " On my way . You know , being an instructor , you can probably just go home . Yeah , and give Winkler the satisfaction ? I saw that bet go down . We got a sprained ankle in bay four I can put you on . Yeah ? You 'd do that ? My money 's on you lasting the shift . Oh , head 's up . GSW . Intubated in the field , pulse thready , BP 's dropping . GSW ? Haven 't had one of those in a while . A gunshot wound , but they don 't have a clue . You 're a combat medic , right ? Look , I want the sprained ankle , but if you don 't think they can handle it , we should ride along . Let 's go . All right , come on . Bring her in . Put her on the table . Nice and easy . MINTZ : Good , good . Set her down . Okay , grab her feet . Nadia , you pull the stretcher out on three . One , two , three . Everybody behind the curtain . You good ? I said behind the curtain . I don 't need you puking on my feet . Where the hell is Jen ? Zoe ? She , uh , she had to close an experiment . All right , I need another assist . Nadia . Look at me . I can 't . I 'll go back and clean up the blood . Donner , you 're clean . Scrub and mask . Huh ? Scrub and mask . You 're not contaminated . Claire , how 's she doing ? BP 's 80 over 50 and dropping . Heart rate 's 130 and spiking . Copy that . We 'll hold her blood pressure . Zoe , 2 units O-negative on the rapid infuser . How long has she been unconscious ? Wassenfelder ? Um , uh , like , t-ten minutes , tops . Any brain trauma ? Did she hit her head ? Scan 's not seeing any . No , she-she just fainted when she saw her thumb . All right , I 'm gonna take a look . Donner , let 's go . I got it . No , too late . You stay outside the curtain . Donner , let 's go . Forceps and scissors . I mean , it 's , like , how can they not let you do drugs ? Oh , man . I don 't think - In space ? I haven 't thought about that a thousand times . Yeah , but they can 't even tell , you know . Now it 's like it 's untraceable . They wouldn 't even know , so ... I can 't do it . Could you stop it ? Here we go . Just stop . You 're a ridiculous poseur without a clue . I 've watched too many of my friends - In church ? My neighbourhood back in Jersey City . Anyway , just people I grew up with . It starts out all fun and games until the inevitable OD , the failed rehab and the pathetic downward spiral . Is she always this much fun ? You have no idea , dude . MINTZ : Let 's go . Scope in . What-what about her thumb ? Forget the thumb . Priorities . Okay , well , it 's important to her . We can regrow it . Not in a week . She can 't pilot the Venus Lander without her thumb . Step out , Wass . Don 't screw her over like this ! You go help Nadia vacuum up the blood in the pod bay . Go . I can 't see anything . Donner , I need suction . Clear that out for me . Yeah . Oh , wow . That 's a lot of blood . I can get it . Okay . Here we go . Is that better ? Much . Ah , damn . She 's got a peritoneal bleed . Meaning what ? We got a bloodbath . I need suction . Clear that out for me . MAN : I need more suction , people . Come on . Where 's my surgical consult ? He can 't handle it . He 's gonna lose him . Tell him . Man , that 's bloody . You need a visual , Doctor . We have a visual . No , you got a camera and soup . You need to open up the wound . I prefer to minimise the trauma . Well , I prefer to save the patient . " CLAIRE : Her BP 's still dropping , 70 over 40 . " I can see that , Claire . Thank you . JEN : Evram ? Well , I can 't stop the bleed unless I find it . What 's going on here ? MINTZ : more suction , Zoe . Nothing . EVE : Are we gonna lose her ? She 'll hold as long as we keep pumping blood . Yeah , but they 'll burn through their reserves . They 'll have an on-ship blood drive , Mike . They 'll have time . And if they exhaust the supply ? Ev will have the wound closed before then . He 'll have it closed . He will . Maybe you should open it up , Ev . Find the bleed with your eyes . Oh , you 're a surgeon now , Donner ? You gave that advice to somebody and it worked . Right ? When is the last time you didn 't use the fibre cam ? You need to use your hands , your eyes . Incise . Get him out of here before I call security . What 's going on , Donner ? Uh , I think somebody 's gonna blow a gasket - I don 't know if it 's Mintz or the kid . Dr Mintz ? In wartime triage , we 'd have red-tagged this kid and saved him with a sewing kit . This idiot has every technology known to man , and he 's gonna kill him . MONITOR BEEPS ERRATICALLY WOMAN : He 's in free fall . We 're losing him . I 'm going in . My patient . Security ! His patient , Doctor . Give it to him . 7 blade . The scalpel with the 7 on it . Come on . Let 's go . Okay , retract and give me some suction . Open her up , Ev . Ev . DONNER : Come on . All right , let 's open her up . Gone . 7 blade . ZOE : 7 blade . MINTZ : Incising . HE GASPS MONITOR BEEPS ERRATICALLY " CLAIRE : Evram . " GIRL SCREAMS DONNER : Mintz ? " Mintz , is there a problem ? Mintz , what is going on ? " DONNER : Mintz . What are we doing , Ev ? Evram , you have to incise . You 're losing her . Ev ? I don 't want to lose her . Well , open her up , okay ? Forget the machines . Just use your eyes . Use your hands . She 's sliding , Ev . She 's in free fall . Ev , I know you can do this . Damn it . Save her . Scalpel . Here we go . Retractor . Okay , retract and give me some suction . Okay , suction here and here . And I still can 't see . ALARM BEEPS I-I can 't see it . Uh ... I see it . There . I can 't , Donner . I can 't . It 's right there . MONITOR BEEPS Find it with my hands . Oh , got it . Clamp . Ev , use your hands . I can 't see it , Donner . It 's right - Oh , God . HE GROANS ALARM BEEPS BP 's rising . He 's coming back . I think I got it . I got it . Help . He 's got it . Her BP 's rising . MONITOR BEEPS STEADILY All right . Copy that . Let 's clamp her , and we 'll get to work . Who 's your oldest trauma surgeon , Doctor ? Uh , our chief . He 's 75 . You may want to have him finish up . You really have that much trouble with blood ? HE GRUNTS That 's pathetic . HE GROANS That was amazing . That 's all I wanted to say . I...I , um ... I just ... I just , um ... Whatever . Look , can I buy you a drink after work ? Or something ? Or a drink . Yeah . Okay . Okay . Well , that was an eventful morning . It 's not usually that exciting around here , Which is the way I prefer it . Do you ever ... wonder what your life would have been like if you hadn 't left the ISO ? Oh , I wanted to fly . I wanted to go to space . But I made a choice . No regrets ? Well , that 's the blessing in having a choice , isn 't it ? No regrets . INHALES SHARPLY Is something wrong ? Cramps . That one was bad . It 's fine . Well , then get off your feet . You know , take the rest of the shift off , Zoe . We 'll see you tomorrow . Really . Thanks . Already ? No , it-it won 't get bad until tonight . I just need a hot bath and bed . I 'll be fine . Zoe . Told ya . Told me what ? You made the right decision . That 's not exactly what I got from her , but it doesn 't matter . It 's done . Did anyone bet he 'd make it past lunch ? Mm-hmm . Mintz . The man 's on a roll . You can 't say he went easy on me , though . Mm-hmm . Mm . ( LAUGHS ) Uh , since he 's , uh , already got your money , I think I 'm gonna head out . I 've had enough for one day . You take care of that one , all right ? I 'll try . God , he came so close . So close . Are you following me ? Mm . I was gonna ask if you 're avoiding me . I saw you , uh , change groups earlier . Oh . Then I probably am . Yeah . Yeah . You know , uh , we still got five years of training left , and God forbid we 're both on the same crew . Yeah , I know , Donner . We have to work together . Uh-huh . Just having a tough day . They send you home ? Yeah . How come ? Cramps . Oh , right . Cramps , yeah . Yeah . Those are pretty bad , huh ? Yeah . I mean , I-I hear . You mind if we don 't talk about me ? I 'd just rather not . Yeah . Sure . So you following me ? SHE LAUGHS I , uh ... I got a blood thing . Your blood thing . Wait a minute . You know about my blood thing ? No . No . No . Who won the pool ? Mintz won the pool . I didn 't puke . Yeah , I would never figure you for a blood-fearing man . It 's just a childhood thing , you know ? It started with bacon . Bacon ? Yeah , I used to eat a lot of bacon . I had an uncle who was a farmer . He was into the whole sustainable thing and cured his own meats . Thought I ought to know where bacon came from , so he said if I spent the summer up on the farm , I could have all the bacon I wanted . It sounded pretty good to me . I was nine . Anyway , he had this pig named Thomas . It was kind of my job that summer just to take care of him and feed him and clean out his pen - basically be Thomas 's best friend for the summer . Pigs are pretty smart . I don 't know if you knew that - SHE MOANS What 's going on ? Huh ? It 's , uh ... It 's what ? Donner ? What 's up ? I ... ( grunts ) I need a doctor . Now . MAN : Right this way . Okay . Get her into a bay . Stats and IV access now . Let 's move . Okay , what happened ? Was she hit ? Uh , she said she was cramping up and then she - she just went down . Cramping ? Okay , don 't worry . We 'll take care of her . HE VOMITS RUSSELL : She 's so sexy . WASS : Yeah , she 's ... She 's so sexy . Um , there 's no change . There 's no change in his vitals either . See ? It 's untraceable and it 's good for you . Hmm . You 're okay . You two are done here . How about you just take the girl and my man can hang ? Say good-bye to the degenerate . I 'll be outside . Word up . That I don 't understand at all . Zoe ? Zoe . Zoe ! JEN : Oh , God . Zoe . Zoe . Here 's some scissors . Now cut the pants off . Uh , Dr Winkler , uh , it 's-it 's Zoe . She 's ... She 's having a miscarriage . She took an abortion pill this morning . You have to - You can 't let the programme know . All I can promise is I 'll try . Okay ? An abortion pill ? You can 't tell anyone . Now , please , you have to promise - I would never betray Zoe . Hey , Wass , you know , I just had to tell you one thing , man . Mm . Okay . Come here . When you do this stuff , man ... Uh-huh . You gotta make sure ... okay ? You gotta make sure that you just ... You just gotta , um ... You just ... mm . You just ... RAPID BEEPING CONTINUOUS TONE Paula ? Doc ! Doc ! He 's coding . No . No . No , that can 't - no , he was-he was j - Man , he was just talking a second ago . He was just - He was blabbing . Bag him . 10 of epi , charging 200 . And clear . Again . Clear . VACUUM WHIRS What are you doing ? The blood can clog our air filters . It 's crucial that we clean it up . Yeah , well , opposable thumbs are kind of crucial when you pilot a Lander . She can grow it back . Venus is in 12 days . Matrix regeneration takes , like , a month . Steven , even if they reattach her thumb , she won 't be ready . We don 't know that . Yes , we do . You don 't even like Paula . That doesn 't matter . If I was on that table , she wouldn 't give up on me . MONITOR EMITS CONTINUOUS TONE I 'm calling it . ( What ? ) Wait . No . Y-you can keep going for an hour without-without brain damage . No . I 'm sorry , Paula . He 's gone . ( Come on . ) Let 's take a look at that thumb . See , uh , with matrix regeneration , She should have a new one in a month . She won 't be able to pilot the Venus Lander . DONNER : I think she 'll understand . JEN : You think ? You think Paula 's gonna be satisfied with her little classroom in space ? Well , that 's why our good doctor 's also a shrink . All right , let 's cut a clean-edged wound on her hand . 11 blade . DOOR WHOOSHES WASS : Wait ! Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . Don 't touch it . Don 't touch it ! I found it . I found it . Don 't touch that nub . I found it ! So how long before she 'll be able to use it ? With a good graft , regen and some time in the hyperbaric chamber , she could be good in a week , two at the latest . Still good for Venus ? She has a real shot , yes . I need to know exactly what was going on with Mintz . That 's what he said . He said he had back pain . He was upping his meds . Paula almost died on that table . That 's what he gave me , Ted . That sure as hell wasn 't back pain , Donner . Well , I don 't know what you want me to tell you , Ted . I don 't have anything else . I do . You remember that day we were having electrical problems ? I found Mintz in his lab , on the floor . It 's the - strobing lights caused some kind of war flashback or something , and I don 't know what it was about , but he was ... He was deeply affected . He was ... shaking and ... And you didn 't tell me this because what ? Because he said it was rare . Our lives depend on each other . You are to tell me everything - Everything that could even possibly affect this mission or the other astronauts . No exceptions . Do you understand me ? Do you understand me ? Yes . Yes , I do . You know its fur could clog a filter or cause an allergic reaction or send an infection airborne . It won 't happen , Zoe . Your choice has consequences . I get that . Then can you tell me why ? I got six years to keep my mind on Rollie and off Ted . HALOS for that . HALOS kill libido . They don 't do a damn thing if you 're lonely . She 'll be all right . They stopped the bleeding , so she 's in recovery . Did you see her ? You 're not responsible for what happened to Zoe . No , she said it was cramps . It was . I just feel bad , cos the whole time I 'm telling her this dumb story , and she must have been in a lot of pain . Tell me the story . Well , it was about a pig named Thomas that I used to take care of . Because my uncle thought that if you were gonna eat the bacon , you oughta get to know the pig . I never thought old Thomas could hold that much blood . It must be really exhilarating saving someone that way . I 'll forget ' em after my next drink . I don 't believe that . How can you forget someone whose life you just saved ? You did your residency at Richardson , right ? And then ... five years on teaching staff at Johns Hopkins . So I 'm guessing ten patients a day , weekends off . That 's pretty much it . Yeah . On my first tour , I saw 3,500 patients in 90 days . I remember procedures , not people . Out of those 3,500 people , you don 't remember one single person ? I remember a schoolgirl in a bombed-out building during the war . Did you save her ? I was the one that called in the strike . We were moving into Ramallah under heavy fire . I was with a forward platoon and spotted what I thought was gunfire coming from the schoolhouse . Even as medics , we 're - we 're soldiers first . You understand ? Yes , of course . I called artillery , gave them the coordinates . And within minutes , the school was shelled . It was on fire . The roof caved in . And we advanced . To the school ? To the school . I heard crying coming from inside , so I crawled under the rubble . And it was a school . It was just a school . Nothing but children . That 's when I saw her ... Reaching out to me . She was calling for me . Another shell exploded on top of us before I could get to her . That 's the scar on your back ? And that 's who you saw on the table - the schoolgirl . I 'm a doctor . I 'm a psychiatrist . Whatever this was , it wasn 't pain medication or withdrawal from alcohol . This was ... a full-blown hallucination . Did you get it all ? I think most of it . I 'm , uh ... I 'm so sorry . I put all you guys through this . Paula ... Paula and I - You need to stop blaming yourself . I was the one moving too fast . She wasn 't ready to catch it . Did you make the hatch door close ? That 's not the point . The point is I can be a complete idiot . Yes , you can . Over and over , I ask myself why they chose you for this crew . You 're clumsy , you eat too much , and you behave like a 12-year-old boy . See ? But you know what ? What ? Every once in a while , you find a thumb . You had an emergency hysterectomy , Zoe . I 'm sorry . Am I out of the programme ? No . You had an ovarian cyst . It burst . Our scans didn 't detect it . A burst cyst ? That 's what we 're saying . Understand ? ( Yes . ) Thank you . You could have come to me , Zoe . I would have been able to do something . 'We never remember the ones we save , 'and we never forget the ones we fail . 'It 's about taking responsibility or our choices ... 'about learning from sacrifice . # Where the doors are morning all day long # Where the stairs are leaning dusk to dawn ... # 'It 's those hard lessons that shape us 'and how we respond , where we go in our lives . # Where the windows are breathing in the light # Where the rooms are a collection of our lives ... # This is a place where I go ... # 'I don 't think there 's ever been a man or a woman 'without some kind of regret . 'And that 's probably a good thing ... # This is a place ... # 'Because it 's our failures , more than our successes , 'that make us who we are . '

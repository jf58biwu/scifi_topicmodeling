 Earthdash and the moon were born from the gods ' ball game . the same stone was divided . ultinium ore lingering remnant of the creation legend . The stars and planets were born in the gods ' ball game . the gods ' power saves them . The giants ' power . The great power . The legend . The savior in whose hands is the thunderbolt ball . The thunderbolt ball from the legend ? That 's ... Bigfoots . Come to me ! basquashers ! annihilated . 75 percent destroyed . annihilated . 80 percent destroyed . annihilated . annihilated . there are over thirty accounts of direct hits ... with great loss of life . 199.8 ) } WHO ARE YOU ? Local stations report that even now ... Dan ... isn 't it ? Gramps ? My son died and I came down to groundside . Maybe this is the bitter end of my penance . That might be . But there 's nothing that says Slash 's plan would 've succeeded if you had stayed on the moon . It turns out that the legend never did appear . But these babies were born because my Gramps came down here . And I got to see Dan again . and I created . Miyuki ... Gramps . I 'm here now because you came down to earth . I 'm glad I 'm here . Thanks . We hereby convene the Legend League ! A moment in rememberance of our losses . Slash Keens . This League is truly the gods ' battle reborn . Father ? Big brother ... { alt tl : My older brother ... } The task entrusted to these players ... is to approach and surpass the gods . they will not stop . but how can it compare to the pain of all those who have lost their homes and families ? We 'll pay whatever price you want ! Let us ride the Moon Cannon ! Take us to space ! Our borders are currently sealed . You cannot enter the country ! More refugees have gathered at the borders . Use military Bigfoots if you want . Just make sure none of them get in before the launch . That 's right ... We may as well show them . Unblock the Mooneyes broadcast . the Legend League ! These baskets await more than just the impact of a ball . They await the thunderbolt 's power — the ancient power of the gods . These baskets are equipped with energy sensors . and update the legend candidate rankings in real-time . The same mechanism awards extra goals . { sz : " extra goal " — I 'm guessing this is something like a free throw . This sentence is very short in the JP but I couldn 't think of a shorter sub } watch the superconducting cables to see the flux in legend rankings as the match develops . { time from " densetsu geeji " } that energy will be sent to the ultimite veins on the moon 's farside in the hopes they will be activated . { time from " kasseika " } are worth two points . An extra goal adds one hundred points in one shot . A hundred points ? We have to trust our lives to that ? So the legend 's power is worth a hundred points ! Interesting . General Manager . aren 't I ? What 's wrong with that ? They should hate themselves for swallowing this banal little farce while their own demise approaches . { alt tl : while the moon is falling from the sky } our plan will prevail . The whole world will applaud you . will they ? I 'm bored by myself . Dan . but what happens now ? Lady Flora ! Jiiya ! Princess ! Baaya ! my wife ! didn 't you ? Baaya ! Basquash . Who art thou ? { alt tl : What manner of man art thou ? } so loud and clear ! All four participating teams boast players with moves worthy of the name " legend " . but let 's ignore that } spinning out zero-g dunks ! the Lunatic Gigantis ! { spelled this way in the sign } is truly like a lighting-flash ! { lighting or lightning } the first-ranked Cosmostar Miracles ! perfoms his Flashing Step ! He 's called the man currently closest to the legend ! are those guys all using special effects for TV ? Like the BFB League ? the highlight reel of these players has not been altered in any way . Every single play is legend-class ! by special request . This team was thrown together in a hurry . and their reasons for doing so are unknown . huh ? Or are you just morons ? legend candidates . all the Bigfoots have the bearing of heroes who have come through many matches . will throw the thunderbolt ball ? ! you should stand-by at the hotel . then I 'll tell Nike — That won 't do ! Delicate nuances must be conveyed directly . It 's all right ! I can handle Nike ! I 'm the designer ! there 's something I 'd like to try out . If we can add ultimite to the sole materials — I tried adding powdered ultimite to the sole . James ! Hey . man . We nearly got away with it ... { sz : implies they were keeping " Nike-san 's " identity a secret } You two ... why are you ... ? I wanted to understand you better . How long ? I wonder ? This street style can use the entire surface of Mooneyes ! because two matches will be ongoing simultaneously . it begins ! Tip off ! Come soon ! I 'm waiting ! Dan ! Alright ! Alright ! Stop ! Miyuki and the others already left with Dan 's Bigfoot for the ruins . though ... aren 't they ? They never lied . They just kept silent . one-two ! The two of us ... Neither one understood how the other really felt . The woman loved feet and the man was loony for spheres . Maybe those were our excuses for never really facing each other directly . { this show is so weird } Blinding offense and defense ... { continues illegibly } What 's happening with the Legend League ? It 's really one-sided . it 's Mr. Iceman ! It 's the other way around . They 're losing . Iceman And just look at that dunk by Milan ! No ! The top-ranked team in the Lunar League has wasted no time in ... time and time again ! What 's wrong ? It 's only just started . Low on oxygen already ? Don 't underestimate the moon ! Go back to the surface ! who art thou ? Dan . Milan score yet again ! It 's not even close . Is Toriena Heaven 's reckless strategy of playing undermanned ... The Cosmostar Miracles score another basket ! Where 's Dan ? Mr. Dan ? Did he wake up ? so I thought he must be here ... Then where ? Dan ! That 's not him ! Miyuki ? ! Is this really okay ? Doing this for real ? Miyuki ! Miyuki ! Bring Dan down ! What are you planning to do ? Miyuki ! Dan . This is your Dangan . so he 's the New New Dangan or something . You remember ? The first time you rode your Dangan ? He was waiting for you . Waiting for an operator who 'd really let him rip . I was waiting too . At the end of my search someone appeared ... that person was you . who art thou ? What was that ? Miss Rouge ? Me too . Me too . Me too . And me . The voice of the ruins got louder again . who art thou ? Thy answer will open the door . I 'll take it this time too ! What ? I 'd completely forgotten ... I suppose I was as nervous as a normal man would be . What are you talking about ? I 'm a basquasher ! Destroy ! What ? What was that ? It 's speaking ! who art thou ? What 's that ? Dan ! Mr. Dan ! Miyuki ! Dan ! time to shine ! You don 't know what you 're missing sleeping at a time like this ! Dan ! Dan ! Come on ! Stupid Dan ! who art thou ? Thy answer will open the door . who art thou ? Thy answer will open the door . Basquash . Who art thou ? This is awesome ... no way I could see something this awesome and not basquat ... Dan ! Stupid Dan ! Here we go ! Basquash ! take a look . Dan ! Sorry I took a while . Dan ! Dan ! Dan ! who art thou ? but shut up and listen ! I 'm Dan JD ! I 'm the real deal ! I 'm a basquasher ! Who art thou ? Iceman Hotty ! I 'm me ! Basquash ! This is ... Music ? Its voice ! I can hear its voice ! Father ! All right ! Princess ? Princess ! Princess ! Three colors from ancient days . Hear our voice ... Bestow thy power and call us ... to awake . That ball ... What was that ? Nice job . This is just the start . We might have a chance ... anyway . Alan ? Alan ? Princess ! Princess ... I heard a voice . The voice of the starfarers ? the voice of the stones . The stones ? Those stones are alive . They smell good ! Same smell as the sparklies in Underground . ultimite . ultinium . sustained by the power of the stones . we must make our voices reach them . Raised in a song to call the starfarers awake . A song ? We 'll sing ! Violette ? We 'll make the voice of the legend reach them ! let 's give it a try . We weren 't the legend . But we are idols . We have songs . We have a future . Eclipse will never die ! right ? tell us what the voice of the stone was singing ! You 're unusually quiet . so I left the talking to everyone else . All I 'm gonna do is go . Iceman 's waiting . That 's true . Rouge ! it 's you ! It 's been so long ... Take good care of our princess . Iceman ! Awesome ! We 're going to the moon ! promised land " feel .

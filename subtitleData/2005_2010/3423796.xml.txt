 'Save the planet . ' Whenever I 've read that bumper sticker I 've had to laugh . Save the planet . What for ? And from what ? Ourselves ? What about God ? Can he help us ? I don 't think so . God gave us what we have to see how we 'll use it . Shit rats in a cage would have done it better . Life 's a bitch and then you die . Bumper sticker philosophy . Yeah , right . Sometimes ... you get a second chance . six days EARLIER new sERBIA , eastern EUROPE For hundreds of thousands of people at the Iranian capital this morning began just like any other . At least 52 people died along with 4 bombers and 700 were injured ... Get out here ! Come here ! Get back ! You remember me ? You sold me a gun that don 't work . You almost got me killed ! I paid $ 20 for this . I want my money back ! Give me that ! Buy this gun , Toorop ! Buy this gun ! This gun , very good gun . - How much ? - Five roubles . How much ? - Four . - OK . - Thank you very much . - Thank you . - Pav ! - Tchao ! I owe you . - Is that a rabbit ? - I 'll save you some . Thank you , Toorop . Hey , Toorop . Toorop . Somebody came by looking for you . Ok . This morning began like any other . At the peak of the rush hour , bombs were detonated in three crowded trains and aboard a bus . At least 50 ... Get up , Toorop . Karl , is that you ? I won 't say it again . Move ! I thought you were in Sudan killing babies . Shut up ! The last time we met I told you if you ever point that gun at me again ... - I 'd kill you . - Get your ass up ! Who would hire a baby killer to get me ... ? Who ? He doesn 't want to kill you , he just want to talk . No shit . If you wanted me dead you 'd have blown up the building . Who ? Gorsky . Karl , you 're a disgrace to the profession . You 're not a mercenary , you 're a fucking terrorist . You need two things to live in this business . Your balls and your word . You don 't have either . You know the difference between you and me , Karl ? I still got both . Take it easy . That was just personal between him and me . Let me get my things . Amateurs . Toorop ! - See you , kid . - Thank you , Toorop . Let 's go ! You are a hard man to find , Toorop . I 'm not hiding . You could have knocked . I needed to be sure that you were the same idealist who worked for me 10 years ago . So you knew I was gonna kill Karl . I don 't like you , Gorsky . You can 't trust me and I can 't trust you . This is not about trust . This is about ... professionalism , ethics . Ethics . If it 's about ethics , I should kill you right now . And you think that will make the world a better place ? Look at you . Still in this shit hole . Surviving . Sleeping with your gun . No friends , no family , no future ... We are the same . You and me . We 're not the same . What do you want ? I need a smuggler . I don 't do refugees anymore . Use you own cargo , you own the borders anyway . Only on this side . This is an overseas delivery ? A girl . She needs to be in America in 6 days . Why are you playing with me ? You know I can 't get back into that country . You know that UN passports are impossible to fake . This is not a fake . Inject in your neck when you pass the official border . This is your new life . Clean credit . John Doe . What 's the catch ? You have to make a choice . That 's the catch . I 'll do it if I have half a mil . I can make you do it for free . You can 't make me do shit , Gorsky . But you can pay me what I need so I can get the job done right . You got yourself a deal . A car will pick you up outside to take you to the rendezvous point . Cross me and you 'll have no place to hide anymore , Toorop . It goes both ways . Gorsky . Shit . Good morning . You must be Toorop . I am sister Rebeka . I just want to bring 3 simple rules to your attention before we start our journey . 'We ' ? I 'm here to pick up one girl . Wherever she goes , I go . That is rule number one . Rule number two : The less contact she has with the outside world , the better . You 're here to protect her from outside influences . That includes seeing , hearing and feeling . Now it 's a harsh world out there , Sister . I know . That 's why we live in here . Aw , shit ! Ok , what 's your third rule ? No foul language . Do we have an agreement ? You listen to my one and only rule : Don 't fuck with me or I 'll leave you standing in the middle of nowhere with nothing but your ass to sell to get back here , your perfect world . Do we have an agreement ? Obviously you are not a gentleman . Obviously not . Now that we have an understanding , pick up the bags . No ... Shit . What 's your name ? My name ? You don 't have to talk to him . You didn 't introduce yourself . My name is Toorop . Are you taking us to New York ? Yes . Now please , get into the car . Are you a killer , Mr. Toorop ? Look , lady , I 'm just the delivery boy . And to me you 're just a package . I 'm not your friend , I 'm not your brother , I 'm not your boyfriend . In 6 days I 'm gonna deliver you and never see you again . Sister Rebeka 's right . We shouldn 't even talk . Come on . Comfy ? You wouldn 't have a light , would you ? Figures . Are you Ok , baby girl ? I 've never been this far . TROITSK , KAZAKHSTAN RUSSIAN BORDER TOWN 54º06 ' N. 61º 34 ' E. Let 's hurry up . The train is gonna leave soon . Take your bags .

Those tigers in the cage ... They weren 't real , right ? Siberian tigers went extinct in 2017 . The last one died in the Moscow zoo . What is she , a walking wildlife encyclopaedia ? They were clones ? Second generation clones . Not real tigers . Copies of copies . But they 're living creatures , made by God . No , they were organic machines made by man . But God made man in his image . So what man creates is also God 's will . Is that what you teach her in the convent ? Then God would be pretty fucked up to make man in his image . You wanna talk ? Tell me what happened at the marketplace . If I 'm going to protect you , I need to know what 's wrong with you . She was scared . It 's her first time out of the convent . And you put us in that situation . First time out of the convent , huh ? So I 'm probably delivering you to some billionaire playboy who purchased you over internet .

I feel them dying ! I feel them dying ! I 'm sinking . Help me ! Jesus , Mary and Joseph , what the fuck was that ? I was 17 years old , living in San Francisco . My life was a mess . I met the wrong man . I was lost in darkness . But then the High Priestess of our church opened the doors that led me on to the path of light . I joined the Noelites and I ended up in the convent . It was a haven for women who needed to heal . I worked in the orphanage . She arrived ... a little baby . Her father was dead . Nobody knew anything about the mother . I took her as my own . I fed her , I taught her ... Everything was fine until 3 months ago . The doctor came . He gave her a pill . He was with her for 10 minutes . And then she slowly started to change , but nothing , nothing as violent as what you saw today . But something is not making sense . How could she know how to operate a 30-year-old Russian sub ? She 's always known things that she never experienced . Aurora could speak when she was 2 years old . A lot of kids speak at two ... Nineteen different languages . Who else knows about this ? Nobody but the doctor . He told me to keep it secret to protect her . He said ... that we would get the best medical help in America . She needs help . Crew prepare to surface . Get her ready . You know , 2 years ago , in Uzbekistan , I saw this viral bomb go off . It was ... it was incredible , everybody died . She 's carrying , ain 't she ? All the symptoms fit . All that weird behaviour ... I 'm telling you , man , she 's carrying a weapon . Do you have any idea how much she 's worth ? If she 's carrying a virus , I 'll kill her myself and burn the body .

I 'm gonna take it out . - What do you need ? - Just hold him . Look , we don 't have time for this , Ok ? They 're gonna send more drones . Aurora ? You got it ? Yeah , I got it . - It 's Ok . - Give me a bandage . We should never return back . He knows the rules . I 'll sew it up later . Now you and the passport are mine . What are you doing ?

Sources report the destruction in Kyrgyzstan of a 1000-year-old convent , one of the oldest continually functioning convents in Central Asia . Now occupied by an ascetic branch of the Noelites , the convent was struck by a missile late last night . There were no survivors . Here , an initial reaction from the Noelites . It is a tragedy to think that even defenceless women who made the choice to withdraw from society and lead a life of purity should suffer the attacks of terrorists who have absolutely no respect for the lives of decent , God-fearing people . We shall mourn our sisters and continue the legacy for world peace through obedience , purification and hope for the miracle we so desperately need . Congratulations , my friend , you 've made it safe and sound . Gorsky . Did you destroy that convent ? I 'm not a terrorist , Toorop . I 'm a mercenary like you . Bullshit ! What the hell is going on ? What the hell is going on over here ? You didn 't leave me a gun ... You 've done yourjob . A doctor is coming in a few minutes . If she 's Ok , you 're home free . And the tracking device in your passport will be deactivated . Don 't make me use it . Sometimes it 's hard to understand , but I believe God has a reason for everything that happens . What reason could there be ? They never hurt anybody . Maybe it was an accident . It was not an accident . It was destroyed right after we crossed the border . Would you like to pray with me ? I don 't feel like praying anymore . Toorop said I 'm just a package to him . Why did you bring me here ? Because I couldn 't take care of you anymore . How is she ? Scared . Yeah , well she should be . Who are they ? To the left the Range Rover goons work for your sect the Noelites . To the right , the bikers work for Gorsky . They 're all here to make sure I deliver . And if we don 't ? Lt 's gonna be a free-for-all . Look , Sister , we 've travelled 6000 miles together . The truth is this has been a suicide mission from the beginning . They won 't let either one of us walk out of here alive . That 's why they destroyed the convent . That 's the doctor that came to the convent 3 months ago . Ok . - Good evening , Sister . - Good evening . Good evening . Where is she ? In the room . Good . You 're a bad man . They are more powerful than we expected . Thank you , Aurora . Thank you so much . - How is she ? - She 's fine . - I have to run some more tests . - More tests ? Hey , you just ran your tests . - What 's wrong with her ? - Expect a call from the client ... What is wrong with her ? Toorop . Toorop , let him go . If you please ... Thank you , Sister . - Get over here . - What 's wrong with you ? I wanna know everything that you know . Don 't you think that if I knew anything I would tell you ? No , I don 't think so . You 're a Noelite . You 're like him . You swore an oath . Not to them , to God . God has nothing to do with it now ! You understand ? If she 's carrying a virus she could annihilate half the city and I 'm not gonna have it on my conscience ! How can you believe that about her ? I don 't know what I believe anymore ! I 'm pregnant . Twins . It 's not possible . I 've watched over you all my life . No one 's ever touched you . And nobody has . Shit . Toorop , they just want my babies . Yes . Mr. Toorop , this is the Noelite Church CEO . I know who you are . Thank you for doing such a good job , Mr. Toorop . You 're welcome . Bring the girl to the limousine and your mission is completed . We 're on our way out . We can 't let her go , Toorop . Look around . Do we have a choice ? She 's our problem now . Thank you , Toorop . We 're going to the subway . - What 's wrong ? - A missile linked to my passport . - How can you stop it ? - Only by death . Go to the subway ! Toorop ! Aurora ! I need you to live . He 's back on line . The scars are all gone . The doctor hasn 't lost his touch . Too bad he can 't make him pretty . Where am I ? In Paradise . We 'll take you to your maker . Good evening , Mr. Toorop . I 'm Doctor Darquandier , Aurora 's father . I thought you were dead . It 's sometimes useful to be dead . It allows one a second chance . You 'll see . Oh , yes ... You were clinically dead for 2 hours . I fixed you up as best I could . We lost quite a bit of time getting you from the morgue and then you went into a coma for 5 days . Now , Mr. Toorop , I believe I owe you some explanation . You see , 20 years ago I was drummed out of the medical profession for trying to implant human babies with artificial intelligence . Around that time the Noelites came to me with an unusual offer . They wanted me to do exactly what the rest of the world was scared of , that is to create a super natural human being with the complete knowledge of the world imprinted on her memory . So I built a supercomputer to be Aurora 's artificial mother . As a foetus , Aurora learned to process information just like a computer . But when she was born , she became much more than just an experiment . You see , she became ... She became my daughter . She was beautiful , she was unique , and I couldn 't bring myself to give her away so ... that 's when they hired Gorsky to kill me and he almost succeeded . He took my baby away , I searcher for her for years but I couldn 't find her . But I knew that one day the Noelites would have to present their miracle to the rest of the world . What do you want from me ? I want you to find my daughter . We think that she 's alive and that she planned everything . She even shot you with a purpose . You see , you died with your eyes opened . But your brain recorded more than you could actually remember . We just need to rewind the tape and fiddle with your memory . I was dead . Precisely . People are starving for any kind of miracle . We were the provider , and we had the copyright . 250 million followers today , two billion tomorrow . This is what Aurora represented . Our stock options were sky-high and the whole world was waiting for a revelation . But not anymore . Aurora was our trademark , but now our trademark has disappeared in a bolt of fire like a cheap magic trick , and you morons can 't even find a single DNA string to rebuild her ! We 're finally on the verge of becoming a bona fide religion and your incompetence has thrown 20 years of planning down the tubes . Who gave the order to use guns to retrieve her ? You left Gorsky no choice ! What were you thinking ? Try not to get upset , Your Highness , it 's bad for your blood pressure . Stop fussing . Well , does anyone have any suggestion ? What should we do ? Your Highness , we want to launch a campaign to inform the people that we were targets of a terrorist attack ... We need to be pro-active , not victims . In 6 months we can offer a closer look at God through our new space module ... We need a miracle , not another gadget ! What ? The body stolen from the morgue was Toorop 's . The police have found the van that transported him in New Jersey . Who would want to abduct the body of a dead man ? What am I looking for ? What you missed the first time . We 'll guide your memory with our computer . Are you ready , Mr. Toorop ? I hope so . Fast forward . Fast forward not so fast . Those are his wars , don 't bring him too far back . We 're losing control . He 's going back too far . That 's his childhood , bring him back ! Don 't leave him there . Bring him forward . Don 't go ! Not on the Noelites , on the bikers ! All right . He 's just past the danger threshold . Everyone slow down . Slow him down now ! Let 's wait , let 's wait ... I need you to live . He 's dead . Wait . Don 't bring him back yet . Go home . It 's alright , Toorop , you 're back , you 're safe . 'Go home ' . What does it mean ? How did she survive the blast ? Lt 's the babies you see . They 're gaining power . They 're the ones guiding her . Their capacity for survival is greater than anything we could ever have imagined . Survival of the fittest . We 're a pathetic race , really . We stopped evolving at a critical point . Machines have evolved infinitely further in the past 200 years , and that 's what I tried to correct with Aurora . Her babies are our future , they are the real miracle . You try to correct mankind by creating a Virgin Mary . The Noelites have found us . They 'll be here in 2 minutes . Find my daughter . You are the only one now . Mr. Gorsky , I hope I wouldn 't have to see you again . Where is my money ? You still haven 't paid me . You have an odd way of killing people . What are you talking about ? I 'm on my way to see our old friend , Darquandier . Impossible , I made his car explode myself . Mr. Gorsky , when I kill , I kill for good . Are you threatening me ? Bless your soul . You need a nuke to kill me ! Bitch . Our satellites have spotted 2 vehicles leaving the compound . It 's too late to intercept them . I am sick and tired of your damn excuses ! Hello , my dear . It 's lovely to see you . - Where is my daughter ? - I see you haven 't found her . And you never will . You selfish bastard . Twenty years ago I gave you the opportunity you wanted . Now it 's my moment . Where is my daughter ? - She 's not your daughter . - She comes from me . - I designed her ! - For me ! She 's my miracle . She belongs to my church . Your church is a lie ! You peddle miracles for your own profit ! Are you willing to die for her ? Yes . Why ? For a reason you will never understand . Love ? I understand love . Find Toorop . He knows where she is . Wait here . You 're finally home . What 's left of it . But I came back for you . Have a little faith . I thought I 'd saved her . But I was wrong . Aurora was designed to breed . SIX MONTHS LATER The perfect holy virgin can 't live in flesh . She was just a vessel , a prototype that wasn 't built to last . She was programmed to create new life and disappear . They say she won 't wake up before she gives birth . But I 'm here , waiting . Toorop . Thank you ... for protecting us . You 're their father now . Aurora . That 's the first time you 've said my name . Save the planet , one child at a time . Ain 't that a bitch .

 Suzumiya . We are receiving a transmission from the advance scouting units . Enemy fleet located . Enemy fleet . Altitude : 8 hours 20 minutes . Distance : 6.3 AU . Moving at approximately 60 % velocity . Advancing towards our fleet . 000 ships . They 're here . We 're going to wipe out the enemy ! All ships to battle stations ! ma 'am ! All ships to battle stations . Controls responsive . Assuming combat positions . Thruster safety released . First stage velocity . Three . Two . One . Ignition . L-Load super graviton torpedoes into all launch tubes . And then all super p-proton cannons ... Um o-on standby for discharge ! Initializing electron ray . Electromagnetic booster at full . All ECM and ECCM activated . Okay ! full speed ahead ! Haruhi . Shouldn 't you stay back a little more ? Your fleet 's a little too far up . too ! When playing shogi or chess ... do you ? That 's ... That may be true . Then you guys take care of it . Find the enemy boss and bombard away ! We 're absolutely going to win . Turn those impertinent Computer Society freaks ... smoldering smithereens ! Shouldn 't we just raise the white flag already ? guess we can 't really do that . 71 ) } One Week Ago The season is autumn . It was a few days after the cultural festival ended without incident . Peace and quiet had returned to the school . it was just another ordinary day ... 112 ) } The Day of Sagittarius ... but when sitting in the SOS Brigade 's base after school I should probably hold off on calling it just another ordinary day . and an esper and yet I 've managed to hold on to my sanity . I must be someone special . Maybe I 'll be scouted for arhathood . You seem to be quite troubled . Not really . I was just admiring how I 've gotten used to this room of absurdities . It 's about time someone praised me . Then shall I offer you words of admiration ? It wouldn 't feel good coming from you . I 'll just end up worried if there 's a catch somewhere . You are quite correct . Sorry for the wait . I bought this Karigane for the first time . I think I was able to brew it well ... Do not worry . If it 's been graced by Asahina-san 's hands even tap water would taste better than thawing Alps snow ! Drink it slowly . where is Suzumiya-san ? She has cleaning duty . When she isn 't here it truly is peaceful . Coming right away ! The Computer Society president ... Is your chief absent ? What do you need ? I 'd like you to take this . You 'll find game software inside . It 's an original we developed . We published it at the cultural festival a while back . Did you happen to see it ? I don 't remember . The only memory I want to retain from the cultural festival would be Asahina-san 's fried soba cafe costume . I see ... Maybe our display was in a bad spot . So what did you want ? That 's right . We challenge you to a contest at this game ! A contest ! A contest using this game ! A serious contest ! We want to have a contest with you ! I 'm begging you . Contest ! Contest ! Stop yelling contest over and over . We 've been preparing long and hard to have this contest ... If those words reach Haruhi 's sharp ears ... Prez ! you say ? Who are you people ? You must be some secret organization or whatever come to interfere with my SOS Brigade . I won 't let you have your way . Shining light on darkness and vanquishing evil is the duty of warriors of justice ! Haruhi . Why don 't you listen to them before kicking them ? Kyon . The contest begins the second someone challenges you . Anything the loser says otherwise is merely an excuse . Wait . Oh . It 's just our neighbors . Why did these guys come here picking a fight ? Like I said ... They were just about to explain that . So that 's what it was ! Craven SOS Brigade ... I-In any case ... the Computer Society are challenging the SOS Brigade to a contest ! right ? Prez ! Hey . I 'd like to move on already . So ? What 's this about ? Let 's have a battle using the game we made . we 'd like it returned . Returned ? Return what ? give it back ! I 'm using it ! The editing for the movie was done on this . Except I 'm the one who did it . too ! that was also me . right ! ? So he was the bored person who racked up our access counter every day . That explains the cave cricket incident . But when I told you to give me it ... didn 't you ? Kyon . right ? You sure ? That stupid deal is invalid ! I strongly object ! I 'm willing to forget the mental anguish I suffered during the computer extortion . No ... I want to forget ... Let 's all forget it ever happened ... so fight with us ! Very well . I 'll go along with it . So ? What are you wagering on this contest ? That 's right . How about new computers for each member ... I 'll give you four of them . You will ? right ? I won 't let you say " forget it " later . I won 't . I promise . aren 't you ? Fine with me . do you ? If you win I 'll give her to the Computer Society . She 'll definitely be useful right away . Since you 're betting four computers it 'd be unfair if we only bet one computer . No ! That 's ... Uh ... No . There 's a huge difference in specs between four computers and Nagato . It should be her decision ! So we can 't take her ! Not that you would know . What ? You would rather have Mikuru-chan ? You be the prize . why don 't you bet your own body ? Don 't just say what you want . What are you talking about ? The SOS Brigade chief is a holy and sacred symbol ! I have no intention of yielding this position to anyone else . You plan on loitering around here after you 've graduated ? So ? Which one do you want ? Uh . Well ... If you insist ... you can take me . No ! I most definitely pass on that . This is a 5v5 online space battle simulation game . The battle will commence one week from now at 4 p.m. Polish up your skills until then . It would be disappointing if you were too weak . He already thinks he 's won . You 're quite generous to give us our prize before it 's begun . It 's all about having a computer per brigade member ! Same goes for her ! About this contest . Let 's avoid any cheating during this . Cheating ? future stuff or ESP is off-limits . Fight honestly and accept the honest result . That 's best . You 're saying that it 's okay for us to lose ? That 's right . The only thing we 'll lose is the computer we bet . That won 't hurt us . Though I 'll need to move the Asahina image collection somewhere first . I 'm not concerned about the computer . Suzumiya-san does not like to lose at anything . Mikuru-chan ? If she feels that defeat is near ... we 're drilling hard at the game . ... she will produce closed space and those hidden things will rampage again . { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } Learn the game while playing against AI . Are you okay with that ? I don 't care . She has to learn her lesson one of these days . What ? You 're creeping me out . No . I was just feeling envious . Of the invisible bond of trust between yourself and Suzumiya-san . I have no idea what you 're talking about . Let 's say that we lose the game next week . you believe that Suzumiya-san will not produce closed space as a result . That is because you trust her . And Suzumiya-san believes that you will lead us to victory . This is also trust . She was willing to bet brigade members because she 's confident that we 'll win . { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } I 'll make Admiral Nelson pale in fear ! You may never express it in words but the two of you are connected by an almost ideal bond of trust . is it ? The III would mean that there was also a I and a II . Feels like they were going for something cool but ended up with something that doesn 't make sense . what about the name SOS Brigade ? The game itself looks fairly simple . Each one of the five people is given fifteen thousand spaceships . You control those from your individual computer . Destroy all enemies or destroy the enemy boss to win . What 's this bright spot ? That would be your field of vision . You can only see enemies and objects within this field . You must send out scouting units and expand your field to be able to fire upon enemy ships . Determining enemy position and predicted course quickly will probably be crucial for victory . Um ... So you can 't see the enemy in the beginning ? Kyon-kun . Um ... I 'm not too good with this kind of stuff so I don 't really understand ... Don 't worry . It 's just a game . Just have fun and play around . No playing around ! We 're going to beat up the Computer Society until they 're completely wiped out ! We 'll be doing some hard training this week ! The boss is obviously me ! Now ! All hands to battle stations ! At least we can count on Nagato ... I take that back . This is hopeless . 120 ) } Drill 425 ) } First Day charge ! 120 ) } Drill 425 ) } Second Day charge ! 120 ) } Drill 425 ) } Third Day charge ! 120 ) } Drill 425 ) } Fourth Day charge ! 120 ) } Drill 425 ) } Fifth Day I got blown up again ! Kyon . This game is starting to piss me off ! Because you keep charging in ! Your strategy is fundamentally flawed . Man ... This is such a pain ! I like things that are easier to understand ! but you seem to be having fun . Just to make sure ... okay ? 276 ) } Day of Battle Today is an ideal day of clear skies and high waves ! 379 ) } SOS Brigade Space Force Her Excellency Haruhi Fleet 351 ) } ☆ 350 ) } ☆ The fate of the Empire rests on this battle ! This conflict is only the beginning ! We will eliminate all obstacles ... 379 ) } Same Koizumi-kun Fleet ... and the SOS Brigade will become known in the far reaches of the universe ! 379 ) } Same Mikuru-chan Fleet I 'll negotiate with the Board of Education and create chapters of the SOS Brigade in all public high schools ! 379 ) } Same Yuki Fleet Even if we 've all but won already nobody is allowed to hold back ! 379 ) } Same Kyon Fleet We must soundly defeat them ! What is this confidence made from ? Two milligrams will do . Just share some with me . Really ? Want me to inject a bit into you ? Well ? right ? What effect is staring at me supposed to have ? I focused energy into my stare and sent it to you ! Your body should be all warm or going through accelerated perspiration . right ? No . My danger sense was tingling though . It 's going to start soon . All ships full ahead ! 160 ) } 1600 Hours 380 ) } Battle Start And so the game has begun and we just ran into an enemy fleet a moment ago ... we 've been able to gauge some of the enemy movements . Scouting while engaging in battle . That 's some furious work . Game-illiterate Asahina-san and charge-crazy Haruhi are completely useless . It 's already 5v3 . We 're at a complete numerical disadvantage . The enemy appears to be using a vee formation in attempt to draw us out . I would suggest a defensive strategy here . You would think ... but what will Haruhi say ? What ? We 're being attacked by a different enemy . When did they get this close ? Oh . I 'm also under attack . It would appear that they have learned our position . What are you doing ! ? Hurry up and fire back ! Don 't need you to tell me that ! Ninety degrees to starboard ! All cannons on standby ! You sound like you 're getting into this . Target enemy fleet ! Fire all beam cannons ! what ! ? Damn . They got away . Same on my side . they disappeared . huh ? Oh . They 're back . From the flank . Such a pain ! What are you dawdling around for ! ? The enemy 's getting away ! but I can 't do anything about it ! then on the right the next ! Then send out the Gun * * * ! I 'm heading out ! right ! Um . Um ! Where am I right now ! ? I can 't take this any longer ! All ships full speed ahead ! I 'll find the enemy head and beat him to a pulp ! I told you not to move up ! Please leave this to us . Forget that . Get out of the way ! I 'll have a gunnery duel with the other big guy ! We don 't even know where the enemy is ! I 'll find him ! Stupid ! Stop it ! Why don 't we all calm down first . the enemy is ambushing us . Where did everyone go ! ? Get out of my way ! I couldn 't even if I wanted to ! We 've lost . Er . What is this ! ? I see . Micromanagement . Micromanagement ? It was written in the back of the instruction manual . You can divide your fleet into twenty groups and control them individually . controlling so many at one time is beyond human ability so nobody was doing it . Beyond human ability huh . U-Um ... it 'll break ... Advocates of defeat will be penalized with ten laps around the grounds ! In the nude ! Ten laps while screaming at the top of your lungs ... { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } " Green Martians are chasing me ! { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } No complaining allowed ! Let 's see ... Nagato-san ? What exactly might you be doing ? Nagato ! What ? I 'm pretty sure I told you not to cheat . I 'm not . No special data manipulation is occurring . I am abiding by the set rules . R-Really ? The actions of the Computer Society are what could be considered cheating . They are ? What do you mean ? Their fog of war is off . including our positions was visible from the beginning . That was easy to understand for a Nagato explanation . We can 't see the enemies but they can see us ? No wonder we can 't win . Yes . Our only option was to lose . I wish to revise that . I understand that they pulled a fast one on us . But still if we use that as a reason to use further bogus magic that 'll make us no better than them . we 'd be below them . I am not disobeying your instructions . I only wish to apply alterations to the program while conforming to the current level of technology on Earth . I am simply leveling the playing field . Permission ? Could it be that you want to win ? Okay . Do it . I see . good . I was a bit worried when they started using micromanagement for scouting but we still hold the advantage . the enemy is in plain sight . It 's about time to finish this . Sink every ship ! Obliterate the SOS Brigade ! Fog of war has been turned on ! Enemy fleet signal lost ! Under attack from port ! Unable to determine enemy movements ! What are you doing ! ? Turn off fog of war at once ! We can 't ! 65 ) } Access Denied 60 ) } Access Denied 56 ) } Access Denied 143 ) } Completely Locked 126 ) } Completely Locked 110 ) } Completely Locked 355 ) } Prohibited 338 ) } Prohibited 320 ) } Prohibited 300 ) } No Changes Allowed 279 ) } No Changes Allowed 256 ) } No Changes Allowed It 's locked at the on setting ! Access is denied ! I-Impossible ! Enemy found ! Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! dragonflies ! Kyon ! Those are mine ! Two enemy fleets destroyed . Remaining fleets are in chaos . Thanks to Nagato-san 's micro scouting the tide has quickly turned . But the boss is still there . How do we take it out ? No problem . We will corner it . Damn ! It 's cornered real well . Like a mouse in a trap . Um . Are we supposed to shoot this ? but well done ! All ships fire everything you have ! Let the enemy commander taste hellfire ! Don 't let him get away ! H-Honor to the Computer Society ! We lost . We were completely beaten . I must accept it like a man . My apologies . I am sorry . But who 'd have thought someone could rewrite the game code in the middle of a match ? I can 't believe it . What are you mumbling about ? So ? right ? All of these computers are now ours . I won 't let you say that you forgot ! you . Who was the one who did that ? The amazing superhacker who could probably crack anything in the world . yeah . I can guess who it was . I have a proposition . Just whenever you have free time ... Would you be willing to participate in Computer Society activities ? Please ! And now the guy 's trying to solicit her . hey ! You can 't rent Yuki without my permission ! Understood ? She 's the SOS Brigade 's indispensable silent character ! I saw her first ! Just hold on . Even Nagato has to have a few things she 's interested in . she looked like she was having fun as she pounded away on the keyboard . If she 's stuck observing Haruhi all the time even Nagato would get tired . Even an alien-made organic life contact-purpose humanoid interface needs some recreation once in a while . Do what you want . Go next door when you feel like it and play around with computers . I see . Once in a while . Really ! ? thanks so much ! There you have it . then fine . one more thing ! You people are the defeated remnants . You have to do whatever the victor tells you to do . All of you must pledge absolute fealty to me from now on ! I won 't treat you badly . Depending on your performance I may even make you full brigade members ! Koizumi-kun ! Prepare the accords at once ! Your Excellency .

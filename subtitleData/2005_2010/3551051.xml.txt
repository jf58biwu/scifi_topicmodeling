 Previously on Defying Gravity The flight of Antares . The grand tour of the Solar system . I think the obvious question is simply , what the hell happened ? We don 't really know . One minute we were on the mission , the next minute we were off . I 'm having a dream about this mission . And ? You and I are both on it . And Ajay ? Will he be coming back on the floor ? Goss wants to do a thorough psych eval . And if he passes ? He won 't pass , Rollie . You know I want babies with you , don 't you , Rol ? Plenty of time for that when you get back . You have any ... I 've had a vasectomy . If he 's telling you he had vasectomy , then he is telling to other women the same thing and he should be outed immediately . What do you know , Eve ? BETA knows . We need you to visit pod 4 , honey . IT chose you . Maybe it 'll give you an answer . Defying Gravity - 01x03 - Threshold What 's happening with Ted ? Heart rate spiking to 190 Pressure 230 over 110 Heart attack ? No , not jet , but I can get Evram to run a scan ... No . We handle this without him . Excuse me , but its my responsibility to make sure that ... Stand down , doctor . This is ours . Ted , are you there ? Come in , Ted . Switch to com 4 . He 's not answering . I 've always believed that doors are meant to be opened . That 's why they have hinges and knobs . You put up a barrier and somebody 's gonna walk through it . That 's human nature to wanna know what 's on the other side . And to ignore the obvious catch . Doors are there for a reason . Hey , I 'm done in a sec if you wanna run . Ted ? Ted ? Admit it ! It 's a breakfast burger from Momo 's . I can smell the bacon . Jen , I feel fine . They are monitoring me . Baby , you 're sick . They got you on thinners , for God 's sake . So , what are you doing there . You 're on the rabbit embryos ? You 're changing the subject . Answer the question . It 's a special project for me and you , okay ? It 's a surprise . How 's Ted doing ? Yeah , he 's fine . So far , we 're in course , no speeding tickets . It 's not you , Rollie . I know . But he left a wife and kid back here . There 's a lot being thrown at him right now . The crew should go easy . Roger that . Just ... look out for him , will you ? Of course I will . You were in Pod 4 ? It was Mars , Eve . Mars . I was there . You 're stable now . You 're gonna be fine . - Does it do this ? - It 's trying to tell you something . Has it happened to you ? Just me ... and one other person . Ted , I have wanted to tell you everything . You have no idea how hard it 's been . - You are my wife ! - And I was ISO before that . Ted , this wasn 't my call . You have to believe me . - I need you to go back . - Go back ? No , this isn 't about us . It 's trying to communicate with you . It 's chosen you , just like it chose me . Okay . Form 24 for today . That is astro speech for daily schedule my fifth graders from Burnaby British Colombia . Zoe and Paula , you run the lander through guidance , navigation and control . Jen ? Uh , ongoing fertility experiments . Phosphorylation in microgravity . Sperm moves faster up here , kids ! And you , Donner ? Find the leak in the Venus suit . Up here , safety comes first . Evram , status on psych evals ? Doors are wide open . Any takers ? Dr. Mintz is our doctor and resident psychiatrist . Life on Antares is a big adjustment . So it 's especially important that we share . Steven , you 'll continue your proton velocity report . Right after jello shots and origami . And I 'll be on the flight deck with Ted . If we can find Ted . I think he 's in the shower . He 'll be right here . Paula ? You okay ? I 'm sorry . G sentence . Hello . - Space cookies on the loose . - That 's including the morning meal . Nice of you to join us . - You got it too ? - I 'm fine . Rollie asked me to look out for you . He sensed you might need am ear . That 's very big of him . It 's a commander thing . Friend thing . Or whatever . I 'm here if you need me . Six years is a long time . Is she sure you want to open that door ? 5 Years Earlier Pilots read ? And biologist is a fancy name for " gardener " ? I was replacing genes while you were still playing with dolls . I still play with dolls . Is that so ? - Hey . Beautiful day . - It 's going to rain . Well , rain 's nature 's way of wiping the slate clean . And a leading cause of mold ... flooding . And pessimistic blonde A.S.C.A.N.S. - Look , I don 't know why we just can 't be ... - What ? - Cordial . - Cordial ? Yeah , maybe more than cordial . Cordial is as far as I go . Any particular reason for that ? Aren 't you the guy with the " I don 't date astronauts " rule ? Yeah . Technically . I mean , why flirt with someone , technically you can 't even ask out for dinner ? It 's a rule worth keeping , Donner . And it 's my rule too . They 're called HALOs . What angels wear . Stupid acronym . HALO ? Hormone activated libido oppressors . First used in prison systems to curb the appetites of sexual offenders . We 're using them now for extended missions . Which we 'd want to do because ... ? Sexual urge is destabilazing the co-worker bond . Causing lapses in judgement . In other words relationships are toxic . You can have sex without a relationship . Yeah , but we 'd prefer you had neither . To that end , your assignment is to wear your H.A.L.O.s for a period of 24 hours to get a sense of how they 'll function ... Behind the ear , Mr. Fassenwelder ! It 's Wassenfelder . - Want to switch with me ? Give me yours . - No . Thousands of years of reproductive evolution wiped out with a tiny green dot . How do we know what they put into these things ? Hormon weirdness can effect the fetus . Will you stop with the fetus ? Zoe , it 's not an option . You can 't have a baby right now . Especially not Maddux Donner 's . Side effects are rare , so they say . While we believe it 's a safer alternative to the messy side of cohabitation , as with all medical procedures , I must advise you of its detractors . That wasn 't funny . Oh , it 's funny , but I think this is ... Open . It 's talking to her again . - May I help you , sir ? - Yes . I 'm Ajay Sharma . I 'm the flight engineer ... Former flight engineer to the Antares . - You might recognize me . - Yes , sir . Yes . My credentials seems not to be working . Please have a seat , sir , and I 'll call in and see what I can do . I 'm sure it will be fine if you just let me in . Please , have a seat , sir . Yo Paula Puke . queen of the upchuck . Mistress of heave . When my door is closed ... it means I have intentionally put it that way for my privacy . - And ? - And if you wish to move through that barrier , you will need to ask for my permission . " Yes ? " is not a permission . " Who is it ? " is not a permission . The only thing that will give you permission to enter are the words " Please , come in . " But you , Steven , you will only get as far as " Who is it ? " . Because after I hear your name , I am bolting the door . - So you want me to leave ? - Get out . - Get out ! - Okay . So Paula is not doing the GNC with you ? The last thing we need is vomit in the Venus lander . Yeah , the deck is never gonna smell the same . Who is the alt ? You damn well know who the alt is . STD . Sexy tragic Donner . AKA the clap . I 'm never gonna shake that guy , am I ? Not for the next six years . No . There is this line you cross with men . You can be colleagues , and friends , then lovers . But can you go back ? Does that line work in reverse ? Emotional rewind ? - I don 't know . - Yes , you do . You and I are both rewound . Completely . We both moved on . Ted . Donner . We 're done . HALO secure ? HALO secure . Hey , Ted . You 're alright ? You seem a little off today . Yeah , maybe a little . I 'm gonna head back for the lander GNC . Paula is still G sick . Yeah , you 're the alt . Yeah . Listen , there 's going to be a lot of back and forth today with control . I might need you there for it . Well , if I 'm not there , Nadia will be . Well , I rather have ... You 're sure you 're alright ? It 's just a little deja vu , that 's all . It 's a new mission , Ted . It 's not Mars . Roger that . You know , they are so concerned about our libidos . What about HALOs for everything else ? I 'll tell you , this thing might have worked when I was in ninth grade , maybe . H.A.L.O. Versus the machine , right ? What can I say , it 's a whole lot of Ted . Give it to me ! It 's really itchy . I feel like it 's red . Is it red ? I don 't need chemical castration to do my job . - Well , the guys do . - Yeah , they actually think they can beat it . We can put a man on Mars , but we can 't find a way to kill his erection . Oh , they have , trust me . I 've seen studies on these things , - and the only two results are limp and limper . - Ohh . - Have they grown breasts yet ? - No , they think they can beat the H.A.L.O. A male 's sexual weakness is second only to his stupidity . - Meaning ? - I think we can make some money on this . The rules are simple . If one of you big , strong astronauts - can overcome the H.A.L.O ... - Rise to the occasion . - Pitch a tent . - then you win . But if you stay limp , sad , and small ... then we win . All right , who 's the bank ? That would be me . Cha-Ching . Don 't do it . It 's a sucker 's bet . I 've seen the studies . 50 large on the one-eyed monster . 50 , double down . 50 , there 's another 50 . All right , bring it on . Ante up , boys . Nice . Anyone else ? Any other takers ? - Looks like we 're in business . - Good for you , Paula . Come on . Any more takers ? Yo , Ajay , spot me . Gambling brings on many miseries , erodes a man 's good name . Screw that . These babies are calibrated for size average astronaut size . I can win this . Perhaps . I would still prefer not to get ... Okay , look . Think of it as a bonding thing becoming an astronaut rather than a geek . Geek . You 're a geek . - Geek . That 's what everybody 's saying . - You 're a geek . This is against my better judgment . - We 're in . - All right . Is it cool ? Don 't touch me . Sorry . Yeah . No problem . Copy that , crossbow . Rate gyro sensor is engaged . - Moving on to page seven . - Roger that . Page seven . Landing sequencer engaged . - I could 've done that . - I 'm the pilot . - Mm , the alternate pilot . - Yeah , that 's the pilot for today . D.A.P. Activated . Preparing lander to tertiary landing site . It 's a glitch in the digital autopilot . The landing navigation system 's gone to the tertiary site . The D.A.P. ' S automatically calibrated for the primary . Not according to the guidance module . Look , the numbers don 't sync with the ship . If G.N.C. sends us to a different site on the day , .. the mission is toast . Forget the mission . You and Paula are toast . Um , all right , it might be the trajectory control sensor . - Might be ? - Well , do you want to check it out yourself ? - You 're piloting . - All right , I 'm the alt . Well , which is why you missed a step . I don 't think so . Why don 't we just hit reset , Donner , and start from the top ? Control , we 're gonna do a hard reset and , uh , go to the top of page seven . Copy that . Excuse me . For tertiary landing site . Well , it seems the lander has made up its mind . It wants to kill us . - Crossbow , are you seeing something we 're not seeing ? - Something funky , Rollie . The system 's switching us to the third landing site , and the override 's not working . - It shouldn 't be dog that , not now . - It might be - an E.S.P. Microsurge . - You check the D.A.P. Config ? Affirmative , and we 've hard reset three times . I 'm going to switch it over to manual , take a system check . And maybe I can isolate the bug . - Uh , hold off on that for now , Donner . - Ted , are you in the loop ? Negative , control . I 'm on the flight deck and have been following . Hey , Nadia , do you know where he is ? Maybe doing his psych eval with Mintz ? All right , look , we don 't need Ted for this . I can do a manual check from here . Do you have Ajay down there ? He helped design the damn thing . - Uh , hold on a second . - Ajay 's not an option . - Is this beta screwing with us ? - I don 't know . I don 't think so . - Do you know where Ted is ? - He 's processing . He 's been through a lot . Well , he 's got to get over it and handle Donner . We can 't have him digging in the lander 's code . Uh , Donner , this is flight . Listen , we are going to power down the lander . Let it sit for a day and reboot . That 's your solution ? You 're gonna hit the off switch and pray ? - Look , I got a retrieve at home with the croup and I 've been stuck in board meetings all day . The lander is fine . Yeah , tell that to Zoe and Paula when they 're trying to land it ... powering crossbow down now . Maybe Paula will have better luck . - Well , I hope so . - You gonna talk to Ted ? Yeah , I got it . - Hey . Where the hell were you ? - I 've been here . Well , we just ran the G.N.C ... I asked you to be up on the flight deck . - Nadia was there . - Nadia 's not the mission commander . She can 't say jack to mike Goss . - We 'll talk later . - No , let 's ... let 's talk about it now , okay ? I got a serious glitch with this landing sequence . - I think I can find it , if they 'd let me go after it . - So find it . Yeah , well , they shut the lander down . - Ted ? - I 'm sure they had their reasons . What ? I 'm sure they had their reasons , Donner . Let me finish this . Paula , you all right ? Leave me alone ! You got a couple head cases in crew quarters . Get on it . - How 'd it go ? - The landing sequence is screwed up . We rebooted three times , then they finally shut us down . Now tell me how it went . Fine . That 's it ? Fine ? That 's it . It was professional and cordial . - Cordial ? - In a very professional way . - Hmm . Well , excellent . - You don 't believe me . I believe you , and I 'm proud of you . - Good . - Despite the fact you 're wearing two H.A.L.O.s. She 's most agile . - 4-letter word for " manhood " ? - That 'd be w-a-s-S . - You 've overcome the mighty H.A.L.O. ? - Feelin ' a twinge . Give me a little girl-On-Wass action , and that cash is mine . The hormone inhibitor kicked in about an hour ago , working its way from the amygdala region of his brain down into his bloodstream . Looks like big Ted 's little Ted ! - Uh ... I 'm going to take this thing off . - Come on . Focus . Keep listening . This is like a race , okay ? I want you to think of it like a long , hard race . - I 'm leaving . - No , no , no . No way . No way . Come on . We 're making a point here . All right , this whole H.A.L.O. thing is about evening the field . - It 's about gender-neutralizing . - If they can hack it , so can we . - Don 't you get it ? - This isn 't just a stupid bet . - This ... this is war . - It 's pathetic . Fine . Think of it as cultural , then . It 's a voyage to an unknown planet . Planet exploitation . Tell me these women go home feeling a sense of pride . They 're being humiliated . So it 's less humiliating to put on the wounded good girl act so a man will pay attention ? - Excuse me ? Come on . I see the way you look at Donner ... hoping he 'll glance over here . If you want him , go . Get him . Oh , you are sadly mistaken . Yeah , the last thing she needs is to get involved with captain limp and the noodle gang . Then you won 't mind if I switch teams for a while . - What ? - You 're going to help them beat us ? No . I just like getting naked . Oh , my god . Is she even human ? Oh , sweet mama , thank you . She 's not interested in you , Steven . Don 't be such a tight ass . Nadia ! Nadia , Nadia ! This is game over right here . Don 't go for it . Don 't do it . Don 't do it . Don 't do it . Is that a setup ? Is that a setup ? - Can I go now ? - Hell , yes . - Are you going to be okay ? - No . Yes , I 'm fine . Yes , I 'm fine . Just ... tired . Bye , Zoe . Come on . Just a little bit . You know what ? I surrender . This is too good . I can 't ... I can 't beat this . Give the young guys a try . Shock them , you know ? Come on , Maddux . Maddux ! In your dreams . Ajay ... respect . We have a winner ! We have a winner ! They just told me you were out here . I 'm sorry . Um , I brought some of the stuff from your locker ... crew suit ... I heard they put you in research . I was permitted to pick up the keys to my flat and my mail , but my gym card was revoked . Yeah , well , the upside of heart plaque ... sanctioned sloth . I haven 't been able to make myself go back in ... to my apartment , to unpack my boxes . When I left , when I packed them , - I was an astronaut . - You 're still an astronaut , Ajay . I 'm in research now . You know , I never realized how much I treasured the connection to this place ... the people ... that sense of belonging . Nice night . It 's , uh ... I just felt a drop . Ever the pessimist . Not much back there to cheer me up . Ah ... nobody ever got smart from drinking . You know , F.Y.I ... this bus only comes here on the hour after 10 : 00 . Yeah , I can 't afford to take cabs . I used to play ball when I was a kid . Yeah , I used to get up every morning at 6 : 00 to go throw with my dad I was gonna be the greatest pitcher Cedar Rapids little league ever saw . And were you ? I fell off the jungle gym and broke my arm three days before the tryouts . Little league had a rule- - no broken bones , no exceptions . But I went anyway , 'cause I figured that , uh , they 'd look , see past the cast , and , you know , see what really mattered , that I had heart . I wanted to play . - Did they let you try out ? - No , I had a broken arm . But , uh , I showed up . So , your point is , rules are rules , no exceptions . That doesn 't mean I can 't take you out to dinner . You know , I mean , as colleagues or something . Actually , Donner , I think it does . Ajay , you 're a stud , baby . Swipe it , collect it , learn to respect show me the money , honey ! He did it . He got one . What happened to " limp and limper " ? Hey , the test studies didn 't have Nadia giving lap dances . They say science is the great leveler . There 's no decency . There 's no ethics . Whoa . Yo , Paula puke ! I think maybe it 's a good time to go home . Roger that , because I ... am broke . - You want to share a cab ? - Only if you 're buying . I actually ... I wanted to ask you some questions about your last paper ... you know , " functional genomics : the n2-fixings of ... filamentous cyanobacteria . - You ... you read that ? - Yeah , I did . It was fascinating stuff . Really ? I mean , because , I mean , nobody ... nobody read that . Well , I also know you like pie . Cafeteria gossip , and I know a great place on the way . Sure . Yeah , why not ? Jen , Rol , uh , we 're moving the party over to major tom 's , and the guys are buying . You know what , man ? I think it 's an early day tomorrow . Come on ! Well , are you sure ? - What , you want to go ? - Well , if the boys are buying , yeah . You know what ? I am gonna make sure Paula gets home . All right . Okay . All right . All right . Bye . Something 's clearly wrong with him . The whole crew knows it . I mean , he 's not talking to Mintz . Donner can 't get through to him , And if Donner can 't ... I guess Rollie 's right . It 's going to fall to me . He 's withdrawn . He 's introspective . It 's not unusual when confronting the universe . Physically , he 's fine . - And Paula ? - She 's in her quarters . You know , she 's not drinking enough . I 'm pushing liquids . Paradoxically , I wish I were drinking more . Are you wearing your medication patch ? My withdrawal symptoms are under control , doctor . I miss you , too . It 's a lonely planet without you . We always face the unknown alone . - The astronauts ' genome analysis . - Thank you . It 's a virtual impossibility that all eight of the " Antares " crew have the same euchromatic and heteromatic gene variations . - What are you suggesting ? - I 'm not suggesting anything . The crew 's physiology 's changing . Lining up like points on a grid ! I know something up there is causing this , caused the plaque that grounded Rollie and Ajay , is probably causing the crisis with Ted right now ! Something 's happening , and I need to know why there 'll be no going back , Claire . Once you open this door , you can 't close it . Do you understand ? Analyze the genome of this . My name is not " Paula Puke . " My name is Paula Morales , And Paula Morales does not get g-sickness . Paula Morales will pilot the Venus lander . Paula puke doing her variation of the dry heave in b-flat minor . They should build these things with thicker walls . - Paula ? - Go away ! I just need to sleep . Oh ... don 't tell me you have it , too . No , I 'm fine . I just need to walk . Is it me , or is everybody on this ship crazy ? You can see the moons of Jupiter . Ganymede ... Europa , Callisto . Never gets old . Yeah , not on day four . Yeah , around the same time , congestion , backache and insomnia begin to work their magic . Mm , loss of appetite and ... nausea ... mm , and don 't forget about the mental jujitsu ... anxiety , excessive fear of danger , my favorite ... paranoia . They 're all normal things , Ted . I mean , they 're expected . Just , the way to get through all of this is to open up to the rest of us . And you don 't have to go through this alone . I 'm afraid I do , Jen . Donner ? - Are you hearing this , too ? - Yeah . - Something 's running . - It 's the lander . It 's supposed to be dark for 24 hours before reboot . Yeah , they 're programming it without us . You 're all the same . You 're one of them . Yes . It 's happening to me , too . What 's going on ? Water ... - Steven ... - I 'm not playing that game ! I got my boundaries , baby . Remember those ? Please ... Ted ? Come on . Open up . All right , so mission control programmed the lander last night without bothering to tell us . We 're going to be looking at brand-new code . You know , I don 't know what your problem is right now , but , uh ... you know , if I can 't help you with ... you pull an all-nighter ? I got inspired ... you know , bunny stuff . - Thank you . - Ted 's in his quarters , and he won 't come out . Hmm . Yeah . I talked to him last night . You talked to Ted ? Rollie asked me to . " Be a friend . " He is going through a lot . So how 'd it go ? Well , if he 's hiding out in his room , apparently not that well . That wasn 't the question . Fine . I mean , it went fine . It was ... professional and cordial . Which is why you 're wearing two H.A.L.O.s. I hear we 're going to have to adjust your dosage , Mr. Sharma . Um , you should be aware that that has caused me itching , uh , which has led to a great ... deal of itching . H.A.L.O.s are useless ... wasted resources . - And why is that , doc ? - Well , it 's never just about sex . It starts that way . It 's always more . Oh . - Hey , pilot . - Hey , gardener . Did 5k . That 's not bad for a hangover . 5k . Yeah . Well , I got 2k and a nap in the park . So , listen , about last night , I-I did have a little bit to drink . Don 't sweat it . Co-worker immunity . You didn 't say what I didn 't hear . Professional courtesy ? Exactly . - So we 'll stick to the rule ? - The rule . That 's what we want , right ? Right . All right , well , I , uh , I should probably ... - Sure . You should ... - All right . How 's Ted this morning ? - Where is he ? - In his quarters . He won 't come out . Hey , Rollie , something wrong ? You tell me , buddy . People are concerned . - So is that what I 'm feeling ? Last thing you want is a shaky crew . I 'm fine . You 're hiding in your quarters . Don 't sling that bull at me . The " Antares " mission was my mission , and it 's my moral responsibility to make sure my replacement is doing me proud . So what 's really going on , Ted ? You feeling alone up there ? You scared about what you 're learning ? Or maybe this is about betrayal , being hurt by the one person you thought you could trust . Well , you want to know how to deal with that ? I 'Il tell you , bro . You suck it up . And if you 're lucky , stupid damn lucky , one day , that wound stops bleeding . You 'll always know it 's there , but you won 't always have to look at it . Not always . Not every day , and you 'll consider yourself blessed . So get your act together , Ted . There are seven other people up there , depending on you , and one of them is my wife . My wife . You take care of her . The lander 's back online . Mission control won 't be pulling that crap again . Well , that 's good to hear . When 's the last time you checked on Paula ? Couple hours ago . She wasn 't letting anyone into her bay . She 's not the doctor , Mintz . I want her up and running and on that lander tomorrow for the G.N.C. - What woke him up ? - Don 't know . He sure kicked our asses , though . It 's true that some doors are better left unopened ... but you usually don 't realize that until you 're on the other side . Nice and easy . I 've killed men for less . We all make mistakes . It comes with the territory . Still no reason to live your life in one room . Are you sure you 're okay ? I 'm going in . I love you . The doors we choose to open determine the path of our lives . Be they brave ... Angry ... foolish ... painful . We 're defined by what we do ... by where we go . And you can 't go anywhere ...

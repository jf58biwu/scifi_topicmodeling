 It 's heaven on earth here . I may never come home , Donald . Hey , they think my fee 's too high , tell them to get another malpractice attorney . Hey , Mom ! Mommy 's working , honey . There 's monsters in the water . I 'm not the one who left the reticulator cartridge in Mr. Adam 's- - Mom ! Hang on a second . What is it , honey ? You know , the kind you eat . The calla ... Calamari ? Yeah , that--that 's it . Put that do- - Put that down . Where did you get that ? Over there . Can I keep it ? You like your new home , boy ? Watch this . I 've been working with him . Go . Nice . Let me try . Let me try . Last goldfish . He 's eating me out of house and home . Hey , you got any money ? If I had any money , would I be hanging with you ? Maybe we can advertise him like a monster truck rally . Nimrod , Nimrod , Nimrod ! No . Negative . Not happening . And chicks , man . Chicks did anything with big round eyes . Something they can cuddle . Uh , news flash . He 's a secret . Think about it . Who wouldn 't pay to see this ? Go ! Oh , man . They have to understand , the species has burrowed into the Lithosphere ... That will mean nothing . bringing hot magma to the surface . There is evidence of undersea eruptions . The heating of the world 's oceans , which in turn is affecting the gulf stream . You know that unequivocally ? " Know " is a strong word . Well , have you captured one ? You know we haven 't . Do you know the extent of the species ? 49 sightings in less than five months . Is the species a product of evolution , hibernation ? Is it from here ? Is it from somewhere else ? We are eliminating possibilities every day . My point is , don 't go talking about how the sky 's falling till you have a way to back it up with proof . Theory won 't cut it . Ladies and gentlemen , Dr. Alexander Cirko . This , ladies and gentlemen , is a northern snakehead . Native to China , it 's distinguished by its small head , large mouth , big teeth , and , uh , its ability to walk on land . The snakehead can survive out of the water . It has a particularly voracious appetite . Since its accidental introduction into the Potomac River , it has decimated the local fish stocks and tipped the river 's ecosystem . It is what is known as an invasive species . But another invasive species has emerged into the world 's ocean . A species unknown to science . A species I have been appointed to investigate . This is what we know . The animal has a confirmed length of over 200 feet . There have been 49 sightings as far north as the Bering Strait and as far south as the Cape of Good Hope . The species is an omnivore , feeding on everything . From blue pointer sharks to killer whales to possibly human beings . It is my opinion that if left unchecked , the species will throw the marine ecology off its axis . Where does it come from ? Its origin is unknown . Its consequences are not . ( Tracy ) Rich . Did you just have another ? Yeah . George ? Yeah . He 's not dead . ( man ) Well , a radiologist looked at your MRI , Rich , and so did I. ( Rich ) Okay . There 's no evidence of concussion from the accident . No brain hemorrhage . No infarction . No plaque that might indicate MS. No tumors . Okay . Which is ? Well , no brain tumor 's always good news . So I 'm okay ? Physically , yes . Why don 't you tell me about your experiences . My experiences ? Tracy tells me you keep reliving the accident . Dr. Davey thinks you might have post-traumatic stress syndrome . And how long have you all been talking about me ? I 've talked to him once or twice over the last two days . - You don 't believe me . - I don 't know what to believe . Look , Doc , this ain 't no syndrome , okay ? This is real . My brother is trying to talk to me . What makes you think your dead brother 's trying to get in touch with you ? Faith . This calamari is breaded . Yes . Uh , fried calamari . Well , I assumed that it would be pan fried . Right . Yes , and I would like melted , organic butter . Uh , yes , ma 'am . Uh , one debreaded calamari , one hand-melted , board certified , culture-free butter . Come on , Miss PhD , you got a pickup . Ugh . Can I get a pan-fried calamari and a yuppie butter ? Explain how this works . I say push the squid , you say yes , sir . Clean it up . I usually like my calamari pan fried . Do you know how much squid the Amber 5 caught today ? Almost two tons . Jerry said the ocean 's full of them . Startin ' to skeeve me out . Whales , Jackson . Whales feed on squid . Tons and tons of squid . Except they 're not . Either these whales ' migrations have been so disrupted that they 're avoiding their normal feeding grounds or something 's feeding on them . Remember that pod of grays that I was studying ? Not taking you whale hunting . This time of year , they 're right off the Farallones , like clockwork . I need to track a whale by satellite . If--If--If I can do that , then I can finally find out what they 're running from . Process , D. I said no . I 've got tapes . I 've got low end whale calls on tape--a transducer . We can just call them in . Plus , Jackson , you 're the only person I know with a large enough boat . And yes , I admit it , I 'm totally using you . You think you can just show up here , convince me to chum a whole day and night , and spent a tankful of diesel just so you can go out and play Captain Ahab ? Yes . I like your style . Mutant ? ( Miles ) Help you with something ? Yeah . Is this all you got ? You owe me . $ 80 plus tax for the jewelry box you and slimy broke . Not you . His other slimy . Oh that . Yeah . Why didn 't you say so ? Thank you . Little creep . That was some Valentine 's gift you gave Greg . Can you imagine what Mom and Dad would think if the originals just fell in their hands ? And the money . You 're going down . Buh-bye . Have a nice day . Pharmacist said this is going to make you feel less anxious , okay ? Oh , I don 't want that . Well , you don 't get to want it , hon . The doctor said it would help . You need to take it . Honey , how many times I gotta tell you , George is trying to communicate with me . I gotta be able to listen . Honey , come on . Come on . Let 's put that away , okay ? Let 's go . You and I will play a game . All right , kid , game tie . Count full . You got a threat to steal at first . Curve . You don 't have the control . Give them your money pitch . Fastball high and tight . What ? ( man ) Last month , our first weather balloon came down in a soybean field in Nebraska . Since then , we 've lost 30 . Most recently in Muncie . It dropped 50 degrees in the Mojave last night . The jet streams moved 100 miles north . Meanwhile , I got a frozen lake in Manitoba that melted in about two days . Oh , yeah . Look at this . Based on water , temps are up almost two degrees . That 's not seasonal . It 's not even regional . I mean , in every ocean , every reading we have . Greenhouse effect . This can 't be explained atmospherically . And you know it 's coming from the deep ocean , your neck of the woods . ( Cirko ) Thank you , Brad . If you would send the rest of your data here- - all of it--I have a federal emergency order . That 's okay . I trust you . Just tell me where you think this thing is going . Straight to hell . And you 'd go out with him . He 's not even a quarterback . I don 't care , he 's cute . I have a question . Do you think Phil is cute ? Chill out , Nim . Some patience . Amber Lou will never be interested in you . She 's a sophomore . A hot sophomore . I-I know you 're hungry , Nim . I 'm working on it . What 's the worst that can happen ? He starves to death ? Not him . Me . Amber could do a lot worse than me . A lot worse . 'sup ladies ? Amber , do you smell something ? Oh , hi , Phil . Meow . So , Amber , you like pets , don 't you ? Uh-huh . ' Cause me and my boy , we got something phat up at the crib . What ? Secret . Gotta check it out for yourself . But I 'll tell you this , it 'll eat a goldfish right out ... of Miles ' hand . How is Miles ? He 's good . Real good . Why you wanna know ? I think he 's cute . Barf . I do . Well , hey , then , I gotta jet . You should definitely come over some time . Definitely . Tell Miles I said hi . I have insurance , don 't I ? And it covers the plumbing . Yes , ma 'am . But only if you use accredited plumbers , Mrs. Balkim . I 've been paying my insurance 42 years . I understand . Just show me where the extent of the damage is , okay ? It 's over here in the side yard . See for yourself . It 's a nightmare . What ? What ? [ shouting ] What ? In what ? Believe in what ? Mr. Connelly ? Everything all right ? Mr. Connelly ? Mr. Connelly ? They should be here . Mothers and calves usually come pretty close to shore . Wait . There . There . It 's driftwood . I don 't understand . These whales got to get down to Baja to breed . I haven 't seen a single orca or dolphin this entire trip . They 're usually chasing my bow . Daughtery . What ? What happened here ? Rabbit traps ? I can 't afford to keep buying Nim 's food so I 'm gonna start catching it . Rabbit bait . [ humming Dueling Banjos ] Dude , talked to Amber . Told her she ought to check out Nim some time . What ? Dude , she 's into it . She loves pets . She 's got that little dog , what 's its name ? You sold out Nim so you could get with Amber Lou ? Dude , rewind . She 's interested in you . I know , I didn 't believe it either . That 's not the point . We can 't share Nim . Whoa , dude . We 're 14 years old . We have to chase girls . That 's our job . That doesn 't mean- - I 'm not letting you go all Willard on me , okay ? You need to get to first base with a non-amphibian . What are you doing ? I 'm going to see if any of them are still alive . Do the words " shark bait " mean anything to you ? This wasn 't a shark that did this . Okay , how 's that ? The way it 's torn in half from below . Probably a killer whale or something . Okay , that 's it . This boat leaves in 60 seconds . Or maybe a school of predators , parents teaching their young to feed . Daughtery . I think I 'll stay in the boat . Great idea . Jackson , come on . Come on . We can 't let it get away . Hang on to something . I said hang on- - I 've got to document this . Stop . Stop . Stop the engines . I don 't think he likes being chased . You 're not out here looking for whales , are you ? Nothing . Daughtery , hey . You all right ? It 's been a long day . Fools . They don 't see what is right before them . I understand there are caveats . But what 's worst case scenario ? The earth sustains geological and meteorological cataclysms on a scale not seen since the Old Testament . These are men that deny the greenhouse effect . Is that how you intended to silence me , by requiring proof ? No . That 's how I intend to help you . [ TV playing cartoon ] Hey , girls . Hey , guess what Daddy got for you . What 'd you bring us , Daddy ? Fireworks ? Yeah . Come on , let 's go shoot ' em . Come on . Let 's go . Let 's go . There it goes . Yoo ! Here comes the 4-th of July ! Here comes another . Aaaah ha ha ha . Isn 't this awesome , girls ? Hello . Wait a minute . I can 't hear you . Thanks . I appreciate that . Don 't let the yellow smoke get on you . It 's gonna burn your skin . Everybody else having to work , we get to have fun . Yeah ! Heather , Emily , in the car right now . Huh ? What ? Why ? What 's the matter ? Planning on telling me that you lost your job ? Oh , honey , no . It 's medical leave . There 's nothing wrong . Everything 's fine . Dad , you got fired ? No . How are we going to live , Rich ? Huh ? Why will you just not take your medicine ? Because I 'm not sick . Healthy people do not hallucinate , Rich . You needed to take it . No , I don 't . Fine . Forget it . Girls . In the car right now . Baby . Come on , now . You 're overreacting , honey . No , I 've made up my mind , okay ? When you can call me and tell me that you are the sane , happy , fun guy that I married , I will be back . But I am . I am that funny good man . I 'm just clearer . You are not . You are completely in denial . And I cannot live like this . Baby , please , Tracy . Listen , I 'm sorry . All right ? I won 't do it anymore . Just please , stop . Honey , please . I 'm right here . What are you going to do ? You going to run me over ? The girls are right there . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? You 're overreacting a little bit . Don 't you think you 're- - What are you doing ? Hey , can I ride back there with you ? No , Heather , you can 't . Close the window . Honey , why are you doing this ? You don 't have to do this . We can talk this out . I love you . He loves you , Mom . Please just get out of the truck . Honey . Oh , that 's real good , honey . In front of our kids , huh ? ( Jackson ) We 're lucky I have batteries and bulbs . Yeah , Jackson , we 're going out to look for some whales . Big , dumb , docile . It 'll be mellow . If I had told you , you wouldn 't have believed me . No . And I wouldn 't have gone either . Sit here . Light , please . Yeah . Can you turn- - Yeah . No , I am . The pulse torched the contacts . Freakin ' slag . The ignition wires are fused together . If I can separate them and jury-rig something , I may be able to get her started . There 's not much we can do until morning . 2 : 00 . Where ? No , no . Sorry . Never mind . I 'm zonked . Oh , Jeez . We could--we could sleep in shifts . We could . Kind of defeats the purpose , doesn 't it ? All-in-all , I 'm taking this pretty well . You coaxed me in my boat on a snipe hunt for a dinosaur then you suggest we sleep in shifts . Hey . Ground rules . I know . I get it . I just want to be your friend . That was a one time thing . I was coming out of a divorce . Just a rebound . No problem . I can play that part . That thing was huge tonight . Four times bigger than the boat . If only you didn 't have to eat a lot of food . What ? Nothing . I was just , um ... Nothing . Phil tells me you guys have a pet . Well , uh ... Yeah . I 'm really into animals . Biology 's my best subject . Me too . But you haven 't taken it yet . Um , yeah . Yeah . Well , I-I just- - I meant that I 'm looking forward to it , you know , next year when I 'm in your grade . Well , if you have any problems , just give me a call . Mr. Mirasko 's a real tool . So you think maybe I could come over to Phil 's later , see your new bud ? Uh , I 'm not so sure that 's a good idea . You know what our problem is ? Language . I mean , how many misunderstandings and fights and wars get started because human beings say the wrong thing at the wrong time , you know ? Whereas animals , they can 't talk . Which means they can 't lie . They don 't play games . Sometimes I think my dog understands me better than my parents . Um , my pet , uh , Nimrod , he can be kind of jumpy . That 's okay . We don 't have to take him for a walk or anything . How about 5 : 00 ? I 'd like that . If I see anything , I 'm going to pull , okay , like that . And then you come up fast . Do you hear me ? Um , I 'd like to have every possible second I could to avoid being eaten . Yeah I know . All right ? Ready ? I 'm already shrinking . Don 't think too long . All clear ? All clear . Jackson . Jackson , get back in the boat . Get back in the boat . What , what , what ? Did you see it ? Did you see it ? Shoot . No . Sorry . God . Sorry . I got scared . I got scared . You want the good news or the bad news ? Good news . I found the problem . Okay . Bad news . I can 't fix it . The engine 's working , but the prop is busted . We sheared the key on the shaft . It has to be replaced . My hands are too big . Mine aren 't . You 're not going in there . Why not ? Because you 're ... That 's what I thought . Okay , line . Line . Okay . Watching ? Watching . You got it ? Not yet . One more . You sure that- - It 's not tight yet . You got it ? Sssh ! Get in h- - What ? What ? It 's right under my feet . Daughtery . Daughtery ! Throw me the- - Throw me the- - No . The GPS . GPS ! No ! Do it . Well , I sure like what you got done with the place here . Trace sent me out , uh , check up on you . Should I just , uh , tell her you , uh , losing your grip ? I ain 't saying you ain 't had no problem . They used to say to us in high school before the game " going gets tough ... " " The tough get going . " That 's some dumb-ass thing . Yeah , sure did fire us up though , didn 't it ? You mind I ask you one question ? Hmm ? What makes you so special ? Huh ? What makes you so special that you get to talk to your dead brother and no one else gets to ? You know , I miss my grandmother . But I don 't get to talk to her none . I don 't expect you to understand . Now--now that--that you got right , boy . You got a family . And they love you . Them two baby girls , they need you , boy . You got a choice you got to make , bud . I gotta go back . Like to be on record of saying it 's a bad idea . One of your worst . Here 's a little something . If that big son of a bitch shows up . ( Miles ) There 's just a few basic rules . Don 't look at it straight in his eyes . Um , don 't get too close to the edge . And , uh , and , well , you don 't happen to have any battery operated devices on you , do you ? Just Kutcher . Go Kutch . Oh , we should probably put her on a leash . Oh , I don 't believe in that . Okay . Um ... sure . Oh , yeah . And--and don 't- - don 't bare your teeth . No smiling ? Not at him . Ooh , he sounds feisty . You 'll protect me ? Absolutely . I just wanted to say I think it 's really cool that you trust me enough to bring me here . Not a lot of guys would 've done that . Well , you 're welcome . I think openness is very attractive . Is something- - something wrong ? No , no , no . I brushed . I swear . It 's okay . I 'm sorry , guys , I can 't do this . You really think she liked you ? Her last boyfriend was in college . But really , I 'm glad you brushed . ( Amber ) Can we get out of here now ? Our work is done . Kutch . Here 's Kutchi . Kutchi-koo , let 's go . Talk to me , George . I 'm here . Right where it happened . Listen ... if there 's something that you 're trying to tell me or something I need to know , then just come on with it . Please , just tell me ... something . All right , George . Here I am . Now you gotta tell me what you want me to do . All right ? You gotta tell me what you want me to do . ( Laura ) Where 's the signal ? Where 'd it go ? Damn EMI filter . Well , you said it was working , right ? Will you shut up ? Sorry . I 've got a six-channel chip set , a cigarette adapter from a ' 93 Saab , and a very rich yacht owner who 's gonna be pissed when he goes looking for his NAV- - Look . There it is . There it is . It 's about 200 miles offshore . We 're getting longitude and latitude . Signal active at 30-second intervals and I 'm recording . My God . What ? Traveled 80 miles in half an hour . Stabilizing our feed . Boom , locked in ! Long as your tag battery lasts , I think we got him . Do you know what this means ? We can track its feeding patterns , dive time , range , lung capacity . Thank you . Hey , Richie . Here we go . Have you got it figured out ? Yeah , I think I do . Well , I went back out to the rig . It 's the last place I saw him alive . Got back in the water and asked George what he wanted from me . Know what he said ? Said what the hell you doing in the Gulf of Mexico ? You know , they 're asking the same question . I 'll gonna leave you to it . Welcome back . Thank you , Bubba . Baby . Hey . It 's me . What 's going on ? Yeah , I 'm back . Mm-hmm . Back to being me . Well , just needed to get a little air . You know . Uh ... Just went out ... in a boat . Yeah . Baby , uh ... I gotta call you back .

I 've got most of them complete . I think there are two left . Yeah . The sound that kills and a teleporter . Dibs on the killing sound . Dibs ? Screw you ! Those are / my contracts ! They were addressed to Dr. Venture , and since you 've been gone ... I 've received two doctorates . So I 'm a Dr. Venture , too . - I was only gone a month . - You can have the teleporter . - Fine . I 'll clean up your mess . - Great ! I 'm half done with it . It 's in the manufacturing wing . I put your staff on the job . Wait . I have a manufacturing wing ? I have a staff ? I did this . I let this happen to them . - The boys were in my charge , and I failed ! - It 's not your fault . These things happen . What is it with you people ? The children were cut down in their prime , and my negligence is to blame . - Hate me ! - All right . Fine , I hate you . You hungry ? Thinkin ' about making grilled cheese . I accept your hatred ! Now I don 't want to worry you with the particulars ... but I am by trade a necromancer ! You know what that means , right ? - That you have sex with dead people . - Phile . / Necrophile ! A necromancer can bring the dead ... to life ! - He was right . - No , here . Switch it , switch it . No , look here . Righty tighty , lefty loosy . - I don 't know . - Come on , man . Eyes down here ! Where are you looking ? How the hell did they get in here ? ! I padlocked this wing years ago . Rusty ! How ya doing ? Long time no see ! Not again . Just let me take the ID 's out . Here . Now you can 't kill me . Hobo code , right ? This one always a kidder . I know him for 30 years ! Swifty , say hi to Rusty . He was so flipped up , turned around , and ... Whoever you are , I don 't want any trouble . Just pack up your little shantytown and leave . You really don 't remember me ? All those adventures we had ? That little brown boy saved your life . This Aztec calendar says today is your lucky day ! Can we keep him , pa ? - Yeah . No . No , not ringing a bell . - JJ ? Hey , hon . You ready ? - Just a sec . - Hello ! - Tell me she works here , too . - My ride to the marina . - Well , I 'll be seeing you , big brother . - You 're leaving me with these people ? Yep . Off to Spider-Skull Island . Did you bring your bi-kini ? - One for me and one for Colette . - Go , Team Venture ! I used to be pretty . Yeah , but not no more . Look at my nose . What the ? Are you raping me ? ! - No . Well , I was gonna , but ... - Gonna ? ! - What the f ... , King ? - I couldn 't get it up . You felt too much like a girl , I couldn 't get into it ! Wait . Wait a ... What ? This isn 't even my cell ! What , did you take me to your place ? ! Well , I got porn here . It helps . Hank ! Dean ! Head . On my head . My apologies . I didn 't see you ... Wait , perhaps you could help . From your helmet I can judge that you 've been here long enough to know ... Yes , pilgrim ! I , in life , was a personal guard to the great Caesar ! Liar ! You choked on a popsicle stick at a Halloween party . - Tell everyone , why don 't you ? ! - Everybody knows . You 're in hell ' cause you 're a f ... liar . Well , I 'm trying to find the souls of two innocents . One , Dean , has rust-colored hair . The other , Hank , is tow-headed . And I ask for ... Teleporter . Money in the bank . So this baby is almost finished , right ? Don 't quote me on this ... but I believe there was a ring , and I loved the radio . - What is he talking about ? - Swifty 's a little punchy . He was a prize fighter but after his brain went soft ... his wife left him and your father put him to work here . My dad 's dead . So , Swifty , you 're fired . Your ... your father died ? Like 20 years ago ! Where have you been ? Here . 20 years ? I 'm 45 ? I haven 't even kissed a girl yet ! My God . That 's sad . Well , you 're fired , too . - So , we just leave ? - Yes . Where 's the ? Where 's the door out ? Those uniforms are Venture property . Can you leave them in the bathroom hamper ? From the ... government . Half-done , my ass . Looks good to me ! I 'll tart it up with a coat of baby blue enamel ... and ship her off to the government . Oh , come on ! No wonder my power bill 's been through the roof . What now ? I got the stuff . How are you doing with Phase Two ? Just finishing up . All right . Here . They don 't hand-write mircodots on the outside . They use , like , computers . They don 't use photos of Macaulay Culkin as money on the outside either . And they don 't have tiny men in their employ . - Can 't believe they let you keep those . - They think a hobby aids in rehabilitation . It 's only fair . I mean , Catlady gets to keep her cats . Beetlebomb , his beetles . And King Gorilla 's got all those Tarzans . There . Fly ! Fly , my pet ! Let the beating of your wings ignite the hurricane ... of my glorious second coming ! Tell the world ... The Monarch shall return ! Eagle-1 to Guild Base-5 . Have intercepted message from Butterfly to Cocoon . - Ready to transmit data . - Copy , Tiny Eagle . Ready to receive . " Hello , friend . Good news . Fantastic Caribbean Getaway ... " Idiot ! It 's printing from memory ! When was the last time you put paper in ? I told you , you can 't run the microwave and the blow-dryer at the same time . They 're on the same circ ... What the hell are you doing ? How did you even do that ? - Don 't do that ! - Doc ? Lab ! - Doc ! - My ... ing brother is an idiot ! - Should I ask ? - Teleporter . This is all I need . Your legs are sticking out of the TV . Where 's the rest of you ? I can 't tell , hold on . Wait , did you hear that ? - I just threw something . - Wait , do it again . - No . - OK , just a sec , I 'll ... I just put my hand in sludge . Oh , don 't tell me ! I think the rest of me is in the bathroom . My clock is blinking twelve ! I think the power went out ! - What are you doing ? - I like digging . Can 't a man leave his home with a shovel without an inquisition ? No . Dad , you have to let them go . I can 't . Sweetie , I can feel them . They are between worlds . They can be raised ! It 's so simple . I just need their bodies and their souls . But I can 't find their souls ! How do you lose a soul ? - They 're not like car keys . - Stop it ! - You don 't simply misplace them . - Stop it ! I don 't even want to think about them as zombies ! No , no , sweetie . Zombies are animated bodies without souls . This is a regular resurrection . Stop crying , pumpkin . I 've done this hundreds of times . David Blaine , Evel Knievel , both daddy 's clients . As was Ronald Reagan till he bounced a check . - I 'm gonna throw up . - Pumpkin , no . This is routine ! I just raise this sword and go ... Rise and be one with the living ! It 's all very humdrum . Let me get the door . Now , don 't touch any of this . You could accidentally make the cats huge or something . Yes , I heard you the first time . Milkshake . While it is comforting to see my legs , it 's not really fixing anything . I don 't know , Doc . I 'm just trying to help . Maybe if we put all of your parts back in the machine ... - Right . Like in that Jeff Goldblum movie . - Yeah . See ? We still can 't find my right side , which I 'm now certain is outdoors . How come ? Because it 's raining on a third of me . I 'm freezing . I discovered my nipples work as a team . Come here . Feel this grab eye I got going . - I believe you . - No . Really . Feel it ! It 's like a pencil eraser . - We have a door , Orpheus . - Oh , no ! You , too , are trapped between worlds ! - What have I done ? ! - Relax . - Doc did that to himself . - My stupid brother did this . I have destroyed your life ! I have brought your sons back ... as soulless zombies ! So , is everyone clear on what his or her job is ? Tigerrific ? You look pensive . There 's no way I can tear the gates down . - I 'm not even close to strong enough ! - Don 't sell yourself short , man . I once watched you cleave an eyewitness news van in twain ! All costume . I don 't have any powers without that thing . No powers ? I thought you were , like , half tiger or something . - No ! - Raised by tigers then ? Like Moogli ? Mowgli ! And that was wolves . But still no . You know , I could pull the gate off . Kinda wasted as lookout anyway . Sure you 're strong enough ? I don 't want you talkin ' about , " That 's a gorilla suit . " - I can do it . - Great ! Then Tigerrific 's on lookout . Or can 't you see without your tiger helmet ? So , if no one has any questions ... Question ? Mr. Monday . What exactly will my title be for this new criminal syndicate of ours ? Title ? What ? I don 't know ! I want to be President of Calendars ! Whatever , crazy . OK , anyone else ? This is going to be so Monday-licious ! Anyone not totally retarded ? White Noise ? This organization ain 't gonna be racially mixed , is it ? I can 't allow my pure white blood to be ... muddied . Do you even have blood ? I mean , you 're , like , made out of static . - How do you even know you 're white ? - I was white once ... before my tragic life-altering television repair accident . Fine . Idiot ! Can we move on ? - So , right at lockdown tonight , we ... - Can we please wait till Monday ? No ! God , you 're worse than my old henchmen ! Flames filled the crock-pit . We all knew the score . Crimeodile hits the eject , saving me . He was like that , his henchmen always came first . Anyway , Captain Sunshine kept on his tail , kept on it , ship goes down ... Captain Sunshine takes out one more evil doer . Me , big deal . I 'm out of a job , right ? Just like that . Sorry , Charlie . I think we 've all been there . Thank you for sharing that , Charlie . Does anyone else have anything to ... Yes ? You . Yeah . Gary , former henchman , scullion class . I could totally relate to Charlie 's deal , but , Charlie , don 't give up hope , man . Escape pods , got your secret parachutes ... I wouldn 't be surprised if you go home tonight ... and find a message on your machine from Crimeodile . Gentlemen , please . Gary , was it ? Gary , the point of this group , is not the enable the henching habit ... but to learn how to hench for ourselves . I hear what you 're saying . Instead of being henchmen ... we should become Supervillains ourselves . - Now , that 's not at all ... - Like in a beehive ! When the queen dies . One of the workers eats , like , a whole bunch of royal jelly ... and he morphs into the new queen . - No , gentlemen ! Don 't listen to ... - I have The Monarch 's crown someplace . I can call myself " The Viceroy ! " - I like that ! - Can I use that ? ! No ! That 's why I 've been looking everywhere for their souls . Because I accidentally resurrected their bodies ! Wait . You saw their bodies ? Saw them ? ! I made them a ... ing milkshake ! - Nice . Way to go , Brock . - Must have been that power surge . Who is your grief counselor ? Mother Teresa ? How can you be so nonchalant about this ? My stupid talismans and I have made movie monsters of your sons ! I don 't deserve to wear them ! It glows ! Your sons ' souls are near ! OK , why don 't you go home and take a shower ? - You 're starting to hallucinate . - No shower for Byron Orpheus ! I can feel them , hear them . Your boys ' souls are in this very room ! Will you stop with the soul crap ? There 's a scientific explanation for this . They are speaking to me . Their voices like thunder ! It 's Dean ! Speak to me , son ! - Will ya tell him already ? - What , and miss this ? No way . Yes , I hear them ! Dean loves you ! He understands and forgives you ! But Hank , no , Hank is quite upset ! Rage , I can hear his rage ! He calls you a crum-bum ! Or maybe a crampon ! It 's hard to hear him . Isn 't a crampon a little hook for mountain climbing ? - He 's definitely calling me a crum-bum . - Here ! It comes from this machine . What is this machine ? That machine ? Nothing . It makes robots or something . Oh , no ! Have I made scary boy robots ? ! Oh , I should never have played God ! Doc , stop jerking the poor guy around and just tell him . He 's getting ectoplasm everywhere . This isn 't a request , King . You and your Guild can go screw ! Ten years of paying ' dues ... and what did they do to keep me out of here when I got caught ? Oh , what could we do ? You eviscerated and sodomized Vince Neil on national television ! I only sodomized half of him ! They wanted / The Surreal Life . KG gave it to him . I 'd just hate for you to be in the shower one day ... when out of the shadows steps a man ... with a smuggled-in molecular destabilizer and zap ! What was once your penis ... is now a tasteful reproduction Noguchi coffee table by Herman Miller . - I don 't respond to threats , Limb . - Of course you don 't . Well , they don 't call you King Gorilla for nothing , do they ? And what king is complete without a queen ? That 's a cake . But what 's inside it , I wonder ? Marzipan ? Tarz-ipan . Slow down . What about the zombies ? Now , I call those " clone slugs . " Grew those years ago from nail clippings , I think . Anyway , after the slugs have been activated , that machine ... - Purgatory . - Whatever . That computer feeds all their nocturnally recorded memory synapses . And memories , hopes , and dreams ? Their immortal soul ! You 're killing me with that crap . Let me finish . That computer feeds synaptic data to their incubation beds . That information is supplemented with basic knowledge ... that my dad recorded for me , so I didn 't have to go to school . And that is why I didn 't lose my virginity until I was 24 . - That is awful ! - You didn 't even see her . It was horr ... No , it is awful that you would do this to your boys ! - Please ! You do this crap every day . - That 's different . Why ? Because you call it by a different name ? Church-lab , souls-synapses , purgatory-computer , get over yourself . - I must lie down . - If it makes you feel better ... the ones you knew weren 't the originals . We 've been through this ... - How many times , Brock ? - This 'll be fourteen . Fourteen times . We had a gas leak that time . The silent killer . Then this other time ... I remember that . That was when we both grew the ... Oh , God ! I know , I know . What were we thinking ? Oh , that wasn 't half as bad as when I had those hair plugs . What is that ? A royal jelly donut you got there , you big queen ? 24 ? Get out of town ! Is that you ? Come here , you big lug ! All right , all right . No touching . I can 't believe that 's what you look like under your costume . Hilarious ! You look like Seinfeld with a unibrow . - Who knew ? - You should talk , all Kevin Smith . Oh , and here 's a tip . A beard is not a substitute for a jaw line , no matter how you trim it . You haven 't changed , same old 24 ! - This is weird . - Totally ! When is The Monarch going to bust out already ? 282 , 283 . OK , lockdown , gentlemen ! - Close gates ! - Closing gates . - What the ? - Hey , Monarch ! What the hell are you doing out of your cell ? ! You assholes ! Tonight ! It 's supposed to be tonight ! What the ? What is this , Liquid Plumber ? It 's that orange powder we use when someone throws up . I got hit with a tiny little man . Monday ! There 's my President of Calendars ! Where 's the big diversion ? Hello ? ! Septapus ! White Noise ! What are you doing ? Remember those guards you were supposed to take out ? Guess what ? ! King ! Anytime you feel like making a move , buddy ! / Et tu , King Gorilla ? I 'm sorry , I can 't . It 's a Guild thing . Phantom Limb said ... Phantom Limb ? ! He 's doing this ? ! Listen to me , King ! King ! This has nothing to do with the Guild ! He stole my girlfriend ! He just wants me out of the picture permanently ! - Come on ! - King ! King ! A month in solitary ought to chill you out . You chickensh ... bastards ! This isn 't the end of this ! The Monarch will return ! You will ... Come on ! The rest will be here any minute . King , this is hardly the time ... Oh , my God , that 's ... The pipes empty out a mile from here . I won 't be able to hold them off for long . What changed your mind ? Believe it or not ... love . It was there in your eyes when you spoke of your girlfriend . I always thought you were a schmuck , but what kind of monster would I be ... to stand in the way of love ? Go find her . Get her back . And when you do , you love her and you never let go ! It 's all too much . I ... I ... What am I going to tell my daughter ? Tell her what I tell everybody when this crap happens . - The boys never die . - But they did ! They shed their mortal coil as a snake sheds its skin . Stop it ! They are Hank and Dean . They have all the same memories ... same annoying tendencies , same everything . Look , if you have a clumsy child , you make them wear a helmet . If you have death-prone children , you keep a few clones of them in your lab . Speak of the devils ! Their half-formed ears must be burning . Brock , you should put them back in the oven . I hate touching them . They feel like giant ... Stretch Armstrongs . Split between life and death . The universe weeps for them . Hank , you are never to call your father a crum-bum in front of company . And where are your manners ? What do you have to say to Dr. Orpheus ? Go , Team Venture ! Thank God you guys are here . I thought the whole plan got ... What ? / ! Qué sopa más buena !

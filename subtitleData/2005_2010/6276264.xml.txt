 We 're losing it ! We 're losing it ! Ugh ! Joey ! Two hands on that net ! Two hands ! Are you alright , Joey ! Are you alright , Joey ! The ocean 's gone crazy , skipper . Let 's get that net in and get home ! Move it ! We all do it together , on three ! One . Two . Three ! Argh ! One , two , three ! Argh ! One , two , three ! Argh ! Ahhhhh ! Man overboard ! Get a line out there ! Get a line out there ! Joey ! I can 't see him ! Throw it again ! Joey ! Joey ! Joey ! Joey ! Joey ! He 's gone ! We lost him ! Joey is the second man we lost this year . What do you mean second ? Who else died ? Who else died ? Calvin died last month . Or did you forget ? Calvin was 65 and had a bad heart . Still died . In his bed , numbskull . It wasn 't like he was out at sea . I still say it 's a harbinger . What are you talking about ? Ships aren 't coming back with fish and crewmen are dying . It 's a harbinger . Before you know it , an albatross is gonna fall out of the sky . Oh ! Oh yeah . Something 's falling out of the sky all right . That is nasty ! Something funny ? No , sir . No , sir . You two have a lot of work to do . Make sure you finish in time to pay your respects . You got it , skipper . See you inside . Be good . Yes , sir . Hi . Hi . You okay ? You okay ? That was awkward . I think your father knows something 's up . Why do you say that ? The way he looks at me . Like he wants to chop me up and throw me in the chum bucket . Come on , Danny stop being so paranoid . I 'll stop being paranoid when you tell him we 're going out . Can we not talk about that here ? Sure . You might be wondering why we 're here and not in a church . You might be wondering why we 're here and not in a church . Well , Joey knew all you bums would end up here anyway , So he 'd want us to cut to the chase . No offense , father . To Joey ! Joey ! Tougher than losing a crewman . Tougher than losing a crewman . Got that right , Ben . Just make sure it 's not my boy , Danny , next time . Yeah . Erin ! Guess what . You got the cabin ? Shhh ... My dad 's in there and he doesn 't know I took them . You mean you lied to your dad ? You mean you lied to your dad ? He 'd kill me . You still haven 't told him you 're seeing Danny . He thinks if I fall in love with a local , I won 't go to university . So , just don 't tell him Danny 's coming with us . Alright . That 's the last one , drew . Let 's get out of here ! I 'm not going anywhere . I have to work the night shift . I thought you and Erin were going to the island with us ? She 's gonna leave with you guys tonight . I 'm going to meet her in the morning . That sucks . No big deal . No big deal . Anyway , given how we lost our last catch and didn 't make a dime , at least now I 'll be getting paid for something . Well , make sure you show up . I don 't want to get stuck all weekend with the two girls . That 's a bad thing ? Later , drew . I will see you tomorrow . Hey , you got something on your line . Holy man ! Every day since I starting working the dock , I drop in a line . Know how many times I caught something ? Yeah , I know . Never . Wow , this is heavy . You greenhorn . Need some help ? Give me the net ! Damn . I lost it . Hang on , something 's in the net . Holy ... That 's a dead albatross , isn 't it ? It 's the harbinger , right ? Get rid of it . Don 't let anyone see it . Why is this bad again ? Looks like you 're in a bit of a rut there , will . That 's a new low for you , isn 't it ? Heard you lost your catch . Damn shame . Damn shame . Still got to pay me for my boat , will . You 'll get your money . When ? Got a good feeling . I 'm going back out . You and your " feelings " . You know , maybe you don 't have the stones for this game anymore . I mean , coming back without fish is one thing . But coming back without your crew- - Hey , hey , shut up , Roy ! Tough guy ! Take your best shot . Take your best shot . There a problem , Roy ? No problem , sheriff . Just reminding your deadbeat brother that , catch or no catch , he still got to pay me for the boat . Will 's no deadbeat you know that . You want another go ? You got to pay up first . You 're not thinking of going back out , are you ? You know how expensive college is these days ? Got some time ? What 's up ? Biology lady , the one checking out the fishing problem , she found something . Thought I 'd bring out a fisherman . C 'mon , help your brother out . No one knows these waters like you , C 'mon . Hey arden . Hi , Jay . Will . Heard you lost a member of your crew , I 'm sorry . Thanks . So , what did you find ? Caulerpa taxifolia . A very invasive species of algae . This is what 's killing our fish ? This is what 's killing our fish ? Could be . This particular algae produces an extremely high amount of a chemical toxic to many fish species . It can break down an entire ecosystem . Well , how do we determine if it 's the cause or not ? What I found could be from a few patches that are controllable , or it could be a massive outbreak . From the decline in fish population , I fear the latter . I 'm taking a boat out tomorrow morning . I 'll let you boys know what I come up with . Okay , thanks . What are you lookin ' at ? Her buckets . Yeah ... Well , that 's promising . Maybe she 'll finally get to the bottom of this . It could take months . And then what ? Whose gonna pay to fix it ? Nice ass . Nice ass . Hey , babe . We 're off to the island ! Cool . I 'll see you guys there tomorrow . You better . I 'll be really mad if I have to spend the weekend with Danny and Carly without you . Let 's go , Erin ! All aboard ! Love you . Love you , too . Be safe . Bye , babe . See ya guys tomorrow . I saw you . Some kind of big grouper or something ? Hello ? What do you think you 're doing ? Shipping out again . Not on my boat you 're not . Maybe you haven 't heard . They just issued a major storm warning . My weather guy says it 'll miss us the cold front will push it north of where we 're going . The cold front will push it north of where we 're going . You got a crew ? Got a enough guys to make up for that catch I lost . Waters haven 't been kind . Got bills . This reminds me , I ain 't running no charity organization . It 's all there . What 'd you do ? Rob a bank ? Do I get the boat or not ? What guarantee do I have you 're not going to screw up again ? I got caught last trip . I got caught last trip . That 's the first and last time that 's going to happen . Make sure of that ! Drew ! Drew ! Drew ! Good morning ! Hi . What happened here ? I have no idea . I was expecting one of my crewman to have the boat ready to go out this morning , and I found the dock like this . Have you ever ... Have you ever ... Ever see anything like this before ? No . Look . There 's some here , some there . Comes right off the end . You see that ? What ? There is something , I can see it . Ohhh ! Ahhh ! You idiot . Were you just throwing rocks at the window ? No . Why ? I heard a tapping on the glass . Like someone throwing rocks or something . Must be a creepy pervert on the island . No , that would be you . What are you doing ? Unpacking , what does it look like ? Why are you bothering with that ? So the clothes don 't wrinkle , dumb ass . Who said anything about wearing clothes ? Is drew here yet ? Don 't know . Haven 't seen him or Erin . We 're going to need firewood if you want to make breakfast . We 're going to need firewood if you want to make breakfast . Okay , I 'll get right on it . I 'm going to look for Erin . What do you think , Jay ? No way a shark did that . I don 't know , I think an animal may have come down and attacked him . An animal came down out of the woods and attacked him and left nothing but a couple of body parts floating around in the water . I don 't know . No blood anywhere . What else could it be ? Look , we 'll form a hunting party . If there 's a sick or rabid animal out there , we 'll find it . You 're not going back out there , are you ? You 're not going back out there , are you ? No . Good . I 'm sorry about drew . Yeah . You okay ? Wasn 't quite ready for that . Any thoughts on what that green stuff might be ? No . It might be some kind of fungus , but the strange way it 's discolored the dock but the strange way it 's discolored the dock indicates it has an acidic property . Can I show you something else ? See right here . Yeah . And here . Is this the same stuff that 's on the dock ? Yeah . Guess whatever it was that was on the dock was also on this boat . Was also on this boat . Except , this was here before we docked . How could that be ? You 're the biologist . You tell me . Is there any creature you know that could leave something like this behind . I 'll run some tests . Find out exactly what it is . Good morning . Morning , Carly . Where 's drew ? He didn 't show ? He promised he wouldn 't do this to me . I 'm sure he 'll show . Come back to the cabin with me . Danny 's making breakfast . I 'm not hungry . I can 't believe he didn 't come . Alright . I 'll save you something in case you change your mind . Oh my god ! Ahhhhhhhhhhhh ! Hey , Ben . Need to talk to you . Talk ? To an old drunk ? We got quite a situation on our hands . Something killed drew on the dock last night . What do you mean , " something " ? I don 't know . What do you want with me ? What do you want with me ? You lost a crewman . In a storm , like I did . I want to know what happened . You know the damn story . No , I don 't . All this talk about sea monsters . It was a shark . That 's what my crew said , so that 's what it must have been . What did you really see ? Could have been a shark . I seen a mako jump 15 feet once . Right over the deck and to the other side . It wasn 't a shark , Ben . I saw it too . Whatever it was ... It took Joey . You 're crazy . Listen to me . Whatever that thing is , it left some disgusting slime on the dock , it left some disgusting slime on the dock , right where it attacked drew . I found the same stuff on my boat where it took Joey . I think this thing followed me back to town . I 'm coming clean on what I saw . I have to . I need you to back me up . So you can 't be all liquored up . I need you clean and sober . I need you to tell the people of this town exactly what you saw , Ben . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Go sell your version of crazy to whoever buys it . Whoa ! What is that ? Something you don 't see everyday . Stand still , boy . They told me you were working out here all day . Oh , hi . Thought you might like a fresh cup of coffee . Thanks . So did you figure out what that slime was from the dock ? It 's a toxin . It 's a toxin . Some form of venom . Highly concentrated . Venom ? Like from a sea snake ? More like what you would find in an ambush predator , like a sea devil . Isn 't that like a deep sea anglerfish ? In a master of disguise , camouflages itself to blend into its environment and then when an unsuspecting prey passes , it sprays a venom which paralyzes the prey . You 're telling me some deep sea predator paralyzed drew and ate him ? No . I 'm just telling you the properties of this slime and where it 's found in nature . And where it 's found in nature . What it was doing on the dock and your boat , I have no idea . Bottom of the ocean is one thing . But whatever this venom is from , it 's coming onto land . Ahhhhhhhh ! Quick , get in the truck ! What are you doing ? ! Get in ! Lock the door ! What are you doing ? Something bit me . Oh , my god ! But whatever it was , I got a picture of it . Let me see . What is that thing ? No idea . I 've never seen anything like it . Kind of looks like an anglerfish . Anglerfish ? Yeah , those deep sea fish yeah , those deep sea fish big thing on their head to lure prey . Oh , god , that looks horrible . Are we here to worry about my hand or ... Hi , this is Carly . You know the drill . Hey , Carly . It 's me , dad . Honey , please call me honey , please call me and let me know you 're alive , please . I love you . How 's arden doing ? She 's holding up okay . She can 't confirm what you saw . All she saw was the blood splattering on the window . Who or what tore those kids up , she doesn 't have a clue . I already told you what did it . And you 're sure it wasn 't some psycho in a costume ? Jay , this thing jumped 30 feet into the air . Jay , this thing jumped 30 feet into the air . It took bullets like I was shooting bb 's . What am I supposed to do with some crazy creature story , will ? This isn 't the first time I 've seen it . Huh ? The night of the storm . It wasn 't a wave that took Joey . It was that thing . For god 's sake . Do you know who you sound like ? You got no idea what you saw that night . You got no idea what you saw that night . You hit your head and it was pissing rain . Joey could have slipped on the deck and fallen overboard in that storm . That 's what I was hoping too . But after this , there 's no denying that what I saw was real . Don 't make a fool of yourself , will . I 'm gonna call in the staties in on this . I 'll rally the boys to meet up at the tavern . We 're gonna need some help to hunt this thing down , man , beast , or whatever it is . You 're all sweaty . Let me see your hand . You 're not gonna propose to me , are you ? That is disgusting ! You look horrible , maybe we should just go home . No , I 'm not going to be the one to ruin this weekend . Well , if you die , that will definitely ruin it . I 'm not dying . Let 's just go to the boat , and get the first aid kit . Let 's just go to the boat , and get the first aid kit . Alright , listen up . The storm moving up the coast has wind gusts near 100 miles per hour . Which means we 're not going to get immediate assistance on our more urgent matter . Drew 's dead . Today up at the bluffs , some of our kids were ripped apart . Kids ? Eye witnesses say it was some kind of creature . Is that what you think sheriff ? I don 't know , maybe a bear , or worse , some kind of homicidal maniac dressed up in a costume seen one too many horror pictures . Whatever it is , we got to find it . We got to find it fast . It 's not a guy in a costume . It 's not a guy in a costume . How do you know , will ? Because I saw it , Roy , with my own two eyes , alright ? Today , and on my boat when it took Joey . You can 't be serious . I 'm dead serious . And I think it followed me back here . Sounds like you 've been drinking out of the same bottle as Ben ! Speak of the devil . Here 's someone that 'll back up your sea monster story . Shut up , Roy . You don 't know spit ! What do you know , you drunk ? Go crawl back into your bottle and let us handle this . Alright , Roy , that 's enough . You all remember the Duke . Yeah ... And I know you all remember the night he didn 't come home . We were running chinook up near the point . We were running chinook up near the point . Must have had 80,000 in the hold before midnight . We had one net left to grab , and Duke , well he says he sees something off the starboard bow . And then he was gone . The crew , a bunch of greenhorns , said they thought a shark took him . Now I ain 't no greenhorn , so believe me when I tell you that wasn 't no shark . That wasn 't no shark . Will here , he knows what he saw . A predator so cold and vile , you 'd think it was spawned by the devil himself . Sheriff ! Just got a call from my sister . Said she saw some kind of monster climbing a tree in the park . Big as a bear , she said . You guys want to grab your rods and reels and look for the loch ness monster , have your fun . I 'm going hunting . Hold on there , Roy ! Hold on there , Roy ! Let 's be smart about this . You want to wait till more people die , sheriff ? No , I think we should do this together . Then let 's do it . Will , tell Nessie I said hi . Jay , you don 't believe us ? It 's not a matter of what I believe , will . We got to find this thing and stop it before it kills somebody else . You people stay home , stay there until we find this thing , until it 's safe . Stay there until we find this thing , until it 's safe . Jay , you don 't know what you 're getting into ! You need professionals to handle this . That 's funny . I thought I was a professional . Go home ! I could use a drink . Not yet . I got one person I need you to talk to . Where 's the boat ? I 'm going to strangle her ! You think Erin took the boat ? Who else , Carly ? Erin 's gone , and the boat 's gone . Do the math . Why would she take the boat , Danny ? Are you kidding me ? She went back to the mainland to chew out drew for standing her up ! Erin ! She 's dead , I 'm gonna kill her . Not if that gross infection kills you first . Don 't touch it . Arden ! Hey . This is Ben . Hi , Ben . Ma 'am . Where you headed ? Diving . Diving , you nuts ? You can 't go diving out there on your own with this thing in the water . You 've got people dying . It 's quite possible the venom we found actually is from some deep sea predator . The only way we 're going to know is if someone goes out there and investigates . And investigates . I like her . Where to ? This thing 's from ocean waters , so it 's going to feel most comfortable in a deep area where the water temperature is the lowest and the salinity is the highest . Ben , know any place deeper than goliath drop ? None in these parts . Goliath drop it is then . Goliath drop it is then . Erin ! Erin ! Erin ! Erin ! Where are you ? I can 't find her anywhere . That 's because she stole the boat and went back to town . She wouldn 't do that . You have a better explanation ? What if something bad happened . Like what ? I don 't know . Pirates ? Pirates ? Give me a break . There 's one logical explanation . She took the boat and went to get drew . She took the boat and went to get drew . Maybe . But that means she 'll be back soon . She better be . Looks like right here , will . Let 's travel as far as we can before this storm comes in . Keep your eyes in the trees apparently this thing climbs . Let me get this straight . You 're saying this thing is one of god 's creations ? I 'm saying it 's possible this is an undiscovered species we never knew existed . How often does that happen ? Every so often . After the 2004 Tsunami , over 14 new species of aquatic life were found , dredged up from bottom of the sea by the wave . We 've only scratched the surface of what lives down there . Yeah , but out of that 14 , how many of those were amphibious man eaters ? None . There 's got to be a better way than you going down into harm 's way , darling . I 've gone down with great whites off the barrier reef without a cage , I 'll be fine . Without a cage , I 'll be fine . Shhh ... Wait here . Did you hear that ? Yeah . We got a fresh carcass . This thing could be close . Let 's spread out , see if we could find it . Anything ? No , we 're just chasing our tails . Oh , my god ! Damn it ! What 's your problem ? C 'mon , you mother ! Show your ass ! Calm down , Roy . There ! Hold your fire ! Stop ! Hold your fire ! Stop ! Nothing there ! What 's wrong with you guys ? Listen to me , if lose your heads , we 're dead . Pull it together , Roy ! Let 's go , follow me . This way ! C 'mon . C 'mon . I can 't believe this . No reception in the cabin , and none out here . I think it 's safe to say we just aren 't going to get reception on this island . Who doesn 't keep a land-line in their home ? Who doesn 't keep a land-line in their home ? It 's not a home , it 's a cabin . It 's a peaceful retreat where my dad wants to get away from technology . A phone isn 't technology , it 's a basic form of communication that one can use to call for help if their hand is about to fall off . What are you doing ? Maybe squeezing it will help it heal , you know , like a zit . Oh ! That 's disgusting ! You need to rinse it off ! What ? With salt water ? Then let 's go back to the cabin . You have to get that cleaned up , that 's gross ! Ahhhhhhh ! Ahhhhhhh ! What the hell ! Roy , it 's coming your way ! I got it , Jay ! I got it ! What on earth are you ? We may have a bigger problem than we thought . What the heck is that ? A hatched egg . You 're kidding ? This thing belongs to the creature ? Nothing else in these waters can lay an egg like this . Are there more of these down there ? Are there more of these down there ? This is the only one I found , which leads me to believe that this egg hatched somewhere else and was swept here by the current . Somewhere else ? What you 're saying is that you there is probably more of them down there . And if this thing is amphibious , its young may have gone ashore to feed . We got to head back .. Jay 's going to want to hear this . Oh my god . This is Erin 's . Are you sure ? I told you it was pirates . Ahhhhhhhhhhh ! Oh , my god . It 's not pirates . Let 's just go back to the cabin . Ahhh ! That 's the thing that bit me . Ahhh ! This thing is from the water but it 's preying on land . What 's on your mind , Ben ? Draw it out of the water , bait it onto land , then kill it . Maybe . But let 's see how Jay made out first . Carly , it 's dad again , I 'm getting worried . Carly , it 's dad again , I 'm getting worried . Would you please call me , love you . I 've got to find my daughter . She was supposed to be staying the weekend at a friend 's house , but I can 't get in touch with any of them . I saw her and some kids leave in a boat late yesterday . What kids ? Looked like Erin and Danny . Danny ? I should have known she was pulling the wool over my eyes the entire time . Don 't blame yourself , girls will be girls . Any word from Jay ? No , want me to try him on the radio ? No , want me to try him on the radio ? Please . Sheriff , this is the harbor master . Do you copy ? Sheriff , this is the harbor master . Do you copy ? Jay , are you there ? Jay , I got will here for you . Do you copy ? He 's not answering . I 'm going out there . I 'll go with you . What was that thing ? I can 't believe it killed Erin ! Ssshhh ! Quiet ! You think there 's others ? I don 't know . Maybe . Let 's just get to the cabin and figure this out , okay ? C 'mon . C 'mon . Jay ! Jay ! Ready ? Jay ! Ahhh ! Here , wrap it up with this . We have to get off this island . How ? No one knows we 're here . Not even my dad . Drew does . How do we know that thing didn 't kill drew and that 's why he never showed ? Do you hear that ? It sounds like that thing ! I don 't see anything . Maybe it was a bird . See anything ? Oh my god . Oh my god . We 're screwed . Don 't say that ! Can 't you figure out a way to kill these things ? Does your dad have a rifle here ? He fishes ! He doesn 't hunt ! What do you expect me to do ? You 're the fisherman , figure it out ! These aren 't fish , Carly ! You told me it looked like an anglerfish ! Where 's your dad keep his fishing gear ? One , two , three ! Push ! It sounds like they are trying to get in upstairs . Danny ! Ahh ! It 's calling for help . No way . Shhh ! Listen ! Whoa ... Nice , Carly ! Ahhhhh ! Turn the light switch on ! Carly ! Danny ! In there ! Go ! Ben , what 's going on here ? Have you lost your mind ? That 's what they tell me . I don 't know if you have any idea what 's been going on- - Better stay clear of the docks for a while . Who do you think you are , ordering me like that ? If I were you , I 'd get on out of here . If I were you , I 'd get on out of here . Ben , you 're gonna get yourself killed . That 's my business . Go on , get outta here ! Oh , my god ! No , oh ... Sheriff this is the harbor master . Do you copy ? Sheriff this is the harbor master . Do you copy ? Barbara , it 's will . Sheriff is dead , Jay 's dead . Oh my god . What about Roy and the others ? They 're all dead . Will , I need you to get down here ! Ben 's gone off the deep end ! He 's building some kind of cage on the dock and he 's setting himself up as bait . I 'm on my way . Come on , you dumb fish ! I got some quality meat right here for you . Ben ... Will is on his way down here to talk some sense into you . Stop ! Barbara , go back ! Don 't point that thing at me ! Run ! Barbara ! Nooo ! Nooo ! I got another one for ya ! Sounds like they 're having a feast out there . We need to get out of here . I don 't want to end up like Erin . We 're not going anywhere until those things leave . And what if they don 't leave ? What if after they eat all our food , they come up here to eat us ? Even if we could escape , where we going to go ? The boat 's gone ! The boat 's gone ! There 's nothing on this freaking island ! What about the ferry . What ferry ? That old ferry my dad used to work on when he was a kid . What good is that ? It sunk . Thing 's been sitting in that lagoon since I can remember . Maybe there 's a radio on it we can use . How are you going to use the radio if there 's no power ? Okay , fine , let 's just stay here and die ! You know ... Sometimes they keep emergency batteries in those radios in case of a power loss . It 's a long shot it would still have juice it 's a long shot it would still have juice after all these years , but ... Maybe . Will , I know you 're upset , but given what happened to the hunting party , we don 't know how effective bullets will be on this thing . I know one thing . I know one thing . It bleeds . Let 's go . I don 't hear anything . Sounds like they 're gone . Sounds like they 're gone . You ready ? I don 't see them anywhere . I think the ferry 's on the south side of the island , right ? Yeah , we got to go that way . Carly ! Ahhhhhh ! I don 't want to die , Danny . I don 't want to die . We 're not going to die . We have to keep moving . Come on . Oh ! Oh ! Oh , my god ! Oh ! Ben ! Ben ! Ben ! Ben ! He 's dead . The venom killed him . Do you hear that ? What is it ? Son of a bitch . What is that ? It 's a hunting g.P.S. Tracker . Ben would embed a microchip with the spear guns in the fish in case they got away so he could track it , catch it later . So the chip 's in the creature ? So the chip 's in the creature ? Yeah . And the creature is headed to the island . Danny 's boat is not in , they 're still out . Carly took him to the island to my cabin . And that thing is there with them . Yeah . Boy , talk about jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire . Well , at least those things aren 't here . Does it work ? The emergency battery is toast . So now what ? Look for flares . Look for flares . Signal 's getting stronger . It 's here . At the cabin ? No . It 's coming from the far side of the island . We better get the kids off the island . We better kill this thing . Will , let 's get the kids first . Will , let 's get the kids first . Yeah . Are you sure you know what you 're doing ? Looking for a flare kit . Keep an eye out for any type of emergency box . Are you kidding ? This place has been stripped to the bone . You got a better idea , Carly ? Yeah . Find the safest , most secure room on the ship and barricade ourselves in there in case those things decide to visit . Alright . But we 're gonna keep searching first . Carly ! Carly ! There 's nothing ! Okay . Guess there 's no flares . Guess there 's no flares . Bingo ! Nice . Carly ! Carly ! Carly ! Carly ! Danny ! Carly ! Danny ! Will ! They 're alive ! Let 's go find you 're safe secure room . This looks good . We can seal ourselves in for the night . They 're here ! Don 't sound like those things . Well , what was it ? Here , wait in here . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna check things out . I 'll be right back . No , please come in here and hide ! No , please come in here and hide ! Don 't worry . I got this now . Go on , get in . Stick this rod through the spokes . Keep the door locked . Don 't come out until I tell you . Be careful . Stick this rod through the spokes ! Okay ! Okay ! I 'll be right back . What is that ? It 's a call . Call to who ? Come on . Must be bedtime . Or feeding time . Carly ! Let 's go ! Danny ? Oh , my god ! Oh , my god ! Ahhh ! Inside . Do you hear that ? Yeah . There 's something up there . Danny ? Skipper ! Where 's Carly ? Is she alright ? Yeah , she 's safe and sound , skip . Take me to her ! She 's this way ! Wait ! Ugh ! Ugh ! Danny ! Danny ! Ahhhhhhh ! Carly ? Carly ! Thank god ! Thank god ! Will . Where 's Danny ? I 'm sorry . We gotta go ! We gotta go ! What do you got ? It 's above us now . That 's strange . It 's circling . Really ? Oh , my god ! Look ! That 's why she 's circling . Doesn 't want her kids caught in the middle of a gunfight . So as long we baby-sit , we 're safe ? We can 't leave here without destroying that nest and all the creatures . I know , I know . I used to be a welder on this ship . I got an idea ! Come on . Come on . This ship was always springing leaks . We had to constantly weld it to keep it together . Oxygen-acetylene . There has to be enough gas left in these to blow the creature and her nest to kingdom come . Line those tanks up with this one . Perfectly , right along the side . Now what ? I want you to tie the tanks together run the rope under the beam through this pulley , around this barrel and tie it all to that block . I 'll leave you the shotgun . I 'm gonna find some gas . Found some . She 's coming down . Alright . I need you two to get off the boat ... Now ! No way , I 'm staying with you . Arden , get my daughter off the boat now ! No ! You haven 't told us what this crazy thing does . There 's no time for that . You have to go , please ! But you 're all that I have . I will be right behind you , I promise . Will , she 's here . Get back ! Go ! Go ! Dad ! Good to see ya , I wouldn 't want to be you ... Ahhhhhh ! No ! Dad ! You always were a cry baby . Can 't you greenhorns get anything right ? What ? What ? Greenhorns , it 's you know ... Never mind . Alright ! Alright ! Ladies , prepare to cast off ! I have a very good feeling !

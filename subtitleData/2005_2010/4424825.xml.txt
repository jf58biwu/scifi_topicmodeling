 i have to go . i 'm not safe for you to be around . but , know this ... nobody resigns from summakor ... nobody . they 're selling tickets for your execution , michael , but they 're calling it a " promotion . " there is a place , another place . it 's where they sent them . it 's where they sent me . it 's where they sent you . whatever you do , stay away from summakor . you killed her ! Come on out here and fight like a man ! Every bit of pain i know , is because of you ! I will find a way to make you suffer ... To make you feel ! Do you hear me ? Do you come here to hurt me ? You raised me up on lies . Did you do that to hurt me ? you 're my son ! Lies ! Do you think i don 't doubt ? My conscience whispers to me night and day . And sometimes , i listen ... But most of the time , i keep my faith in the village . Where is the village ? Inside . The mind is capable of anything , Because everything is in it . All the past , as well as all the future . She volunteered . your mother 's mind is capable of anything . The science of it all beguiled her . But the reason for it ... The real reason , was you . she did it for her son . This one opens the cabinet , as you know , 11-12 . That is where the pills are kept , The pills that keep her sleeping ... Keep her dreaming . I give it to you . Why now ? I thought , " if i can give him this , " a day with her . " Think of it . You will meet your mother . She won 't know me ... Who i am . How will i know what to say to her ? A day with your mother- - You want to know the truth ? When you decide . don 't look at me ! put it on your head . What are you- - what are you doing ? You scared me . You kissed me . Yeah- - uh , i , uh , i-i don 't know why . I , um- - You do know . No , i mean , i don 't know why i did it there . I just couldn 't help myself . You couldn 't help yourself . That 's right . I know that feeling . * No . No , i 'm sorry- - not like this . Three-one-three , i need to talk with you . Four-fifteen- - she 's gone . Is it just nothingness down in those holes ? What 's happened to her ? She 's gone . I , um , that 's what we know about her . So , uh- - My head is so full of nightmares . What , and last night , What was your head full of then ? Last night ? how very flattering . What ? look , as you can see , i 'm sort of rushed off my feet , So , please. what 's wrong with you ? You were in my apartment last night . You might at least acknowledge that fact . Is this some kind of dream ? just go ! Oh , no , man . You must be jokin ' . What do you mean ? Last thing i need is another fight with you . Another fight ? access denied . access denied . Damn- - i 've been sitting on my card , again . I 'll have to go downstairs and get it renewed . You have a problem with that ? What 's it for ? You 're asking me , what is it for ? Yes . Are you gonna give me a hard time , again ? Again ? Look , if you just tell me what this receipt is for , I 'll go . I 'll leave you alone . Anyone can fake a receipt . Why would i fake a receipt ? I don 't even know what it 's for . Are you recording this ? I don 't supply knives . You show a man who says i gave him any kind of weapon , I will show you a liar . Thank you . operator . Hello- - clinic , please . You said you spoke with me. spoke ? Man , i thought you were gonna bite my face off . But i wasn 't there- - it wasn 't me . Look , don 't get weird on me , six . If you got mental difficulties , Get mental help because we all got our problems . Something is happening here . Three-one-three said i was with her , But i wasn 't there . It wasn 't me. hey , listen . You have got to get your act together . Who are you ? You know who i am . You saw what two did to 415 , And you 're just gonna take that ? What 's the plan , huh ? Just stand there and shout at his door ? Do you think words are gonna change anything , hmm ? I am who you were intended to be . I am vengeance . There is only one way . Kill two . Come here . Who is he ? Who is who ? There 's a man in the village who looks like me , Exactly like me . He says he 's going to kill you . Six is going to kill me ? no- - he 's going to kill you . Oh , and that six , he 's angry . Well , isn 't that how you feel ? come on- - admit it . You 'd love it-love it , the chance to kill me . After what you 've done ... yes . I 'd like you dead . So , you will be the assassin . isn 't that logical ? Don 't we live by logic ? Not your logic , not anymore . And your game , what you do to me here , won 't stop me . Are you quite sure that it is a game ? Yes , ' cause no one gets close to two Unless two wants them to . Well , perhaps he will . you will . Perhaps the moment will come . I 'll walk today , hmm . Nice seeing you . * you were my sunshine * * my only sunshine * you made me happy when skies were gray * * you 'll never know dear how much i loved you * * how could you take my sunshine away * Impersonating two is an act of treason . In the event of a two impersonating arising , you must seek him out and apprehend him . this man may look like two , But you will know that he is not two , Because he is not two . He may appear in the village in a disheveled state , Which has elements of resemblance to two . He may claim to be two . but he is not . and he must be treated as who he is , which is someone who is not two . He is a danger to the village . Mom ? Eleven-twelve . Do you have cigarettes ? No . But would you like a map of the village ? Are you sure you don 't have cigarettes ? Would you look ? We haven 't had cigarettes here for eight years And five months . If you don 't look , How can you be really sure that you 're right ? Guilty pleasures . I didn 't supply you with these cigarettes . No . I don 't have them . I don 't even know what they are . I 've forgotten they even existed . You came in here to buy a map . I used to smoke in order to think . You did ? And are you thinking now ? I am . Sometimes ... Yes ? I think . Yes , go on . If-if i could choose this- - A place i want to spend the rest of my life , A warm place , with no memory . Just be careful what you say around here . People will report you as soon as look at you . Don 't be different . I wonder if we smoke to feed the guilt . Speaking only for myself , I smoke for that fine oaky flavor Wi-with just a hint of lavender . These things kill you , you know ? The main health risks in tobacco Relate to diseases of the cardiovascular system , In particular , myocardial infarction , Diseases of the respiratory tract , Such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , And asthma , emphysema , and cancer , in particular , Lung cancer and cancers of the larynx and tongue . So i 've heard . Smoking is a kind of ... suicide . That 's a bit philosophical for a thursday . Thank you . And i say good day to you . operator . Hello- - clinic , please . Am i like you imagined ? I mean , you know , do-do i-do i act like- - I know what you mean . Sorry . It 's just i haven 't had , uh , Too much practice at this and , um- - Will your father be joining us ? All the family together , i-i 'd like that . No- - he 's , um , he 's gone away for awhile . He suggested that perhaps i get to know you ... Get to understand . The things i 've seen ... In these walls . You mean- - Everything . Every step ... you ever took . I mean , nobody warned me . Nobody ever said that ... Dreaming would be such hard work . Say what 's in those sad eyes of yours . I 'm sure you 'll see that the village has ... Everything that you 'll need . It doesn 't have you . Two . It would be quite a coincidence , If i was two , but i am un-two . So , there is no coincidence . You know , if he gets to you , I won 't be able to stop him . I am no more than a numberless wanderer . I know nothing about killers and their motives , Lost to their own appetites . Such beasts have no moral compass . Then why did you create ' em ? If that 's what you don 't want me to become , Then why ? It might be fun , though , might it not , To indulge him ? Take him a woman . Say 313 , if that 's what you desire . If i can 't control my desires , You can control me ? Animals like that are easily manipulated . They leave themselves open to be prodded In whatever direction their masters may ask . Yes . Oh , i pity a man like that . Or i would , if i knew anything about such things . Hey , man , don 't you know you can 't be sittin ' there Just dreaming ' in the sun ? Gonna get into all kinds of trouble out here . Come on- - we gotta get you up . Where do you live ? What 's your number ? Oh , i 'm a man with no number . Oh , no-no - no-no-no-no . Don 't say that out loud . You 'll have every undercover around here Down on your case . Come on . Get you off the street . You know what he 's doin ' , don 't ya ? What are you accusing me of now ? Look , he 's taken some part of me , Separated it out somehow . It 's out there . Please listen ! Look , no . Look- - i 'm sorry to bop your balloon , six , But you were there in my bedroom . And as farfetched as it may sound , I actually gave you the elbow . You kicked him out ? Grow up . You have a problem with that ? Yeah . My card got bent , and i need a replacement , please . You have the paperwork to back that up ? Why would i lie ? Why would you come into work at dawn ? Why are you here ? I 'm always here . Do i know you ? I 'm the access guy . Everybody knows the access guy . If you tell me what this receipt is for , i 'll go . I 'll leave you alone . Anyone can fake a receipt . You feel something- - i know it . Now , i need to get up to the purpose floor . I need you to make me a card . Damn fine cake . You know who you kinda remind me of ? He looks like two . Oh , you think so ? mmm-hmm . You could be a two double . That 'd be a great job . Say , do you do a two impersonation ? Oh. no , go ahead- - say something in the two vein . No , i-i am two . No , really- - i-i am two . yeah . You do look a bit like him , But two 's got those death cold eyes . Hey , they 're comin ' here . I told you , you can 't be a man without a number here . It is all right- - i am two . No , you tell them that , They will blow your head right off- - come on . Knock-knock . How goes love 's young dream ? Always shining brightly , trembling with ardor . Oh , dear . Two ? Not today . Today , we are none of us who we appear to be . I keep having this dream . Take your burden to the lord and leave it there . What if i were to tell you that there is another place ? What ? Would you care to see it ? What ? Would you dare to visit such a place ? I-i don 't know . Very well . Un-two will grant your wish , Whether you wish it or not . Wh-why are you doing this ? An imp for the perverse . I don 't wanna go anywhere . * the animals went two by two * * hoorah hoorah I don 't wanna go anywhere . I don 't wanna go anywhere . * * animals go in two by two * * hoorah I thought i 'd lost you. no . I just wanted to walk . You know , take it all in . I want to go to the other place . Oh , i don 't think so . Village is best for us . It is possible to go there . Yeah , but why would you want to When we have the village ? What did you see when you walked ? I saw what happens when i 'm awake . I saw the holes . But if that 's what it 's like , why don 't we leave ? Because ... On-only some people can go there , you know , To-to the other place . Who can go there ? Who ? people that exist there . People-people that were brought here That weren 't born here . People who weren 't born here ... Like me. yeah , but it 's enough , isn 't it ? No . Please , don 't-don 't go- - don 't-don 't ... Please , let- - just let us talk . I mean ... It 's our day . * the animals came two by two-two by two * are you hiding ? not from me , i hope . You wish . Uh , now , which-which one are you ? The one you can trust . have you ever felt so alone That you find yourself lost one day ? Have you ? i 'm sorry . * animals going two by two * * hoorah * hoorah * animals going * hoorah hoorah 2 times 6 will try to get close to your father . he will pose as six . So , i must get to your father first Before two times six does . Where will two be ? My father has gone out into the village . But you know where he 'll be ... where he might go . Yes . the village church . you know who i am , don 't you ? You are two times six . And yet , you tell me where to find him . He wanted me to decide . I am decided . Are you six ? if i was two times six , you 'd know it by now . Yes . What have i done ? Yes , sit with me , hmm ? the world is not a pretty thing When you look at it too close . We fell in love with atrocity . We make pornography and call it news . A daily fix of horror . We think the coming disaster Is going to be ecological , That the problem is political , but no . No , the great war is psychological . It 's in here- - puhkk . We have made ourselves Into fat and faded wheezing animals , Educated in apathy , amused by cruelty . So , this ... We make a new world , something human . And yet , there is a whispering in my ear That tells me i was wrong , they were right , And the savages-savages-savages had it right all along . I wanted you to come . I wanted you to-to wipe out my guilt . You were right . You are the way- - become hatred , Become vengeance . Yes , i respect that . Kill me . I see the logic in that . And i 'm not afraid at all because we know , You and i , how it is to be human . We must submit to the beast in man . I tell you this because i know who you are . You are not six . Can you still kill me , if you understand the purpose ? Yes . don 't give him what he wants . Oh , dear six , you 're too late . If you do this , we are lost . he will take the thing that keeps him from owning us , our conscience . Words change nothing ! You hear me ? Words change nothin ' ! I know that- - i accept that . I have to accept you . don 't make us become the thing we fear . if we are one , then we can defeat two . One ? Come back . It was only when your father and i Embarked on this adventure that-that i decided , Oh , i want- - that i realized what a beautiful thing It would be to have a child . We were gonna be a real family , Together like this every day . is there no other way ? Every time i wake up , these holes , just empty . Oh , look at us , the two of us . I- - Stay with- - Don 't you know the real two When he is back amongst us ? Well , i like their enthusiasm . I thought they might knee me in the face And stamp on my brain . Still , perhaps another time . Let me tell you where you can properly direct Your exuberance . Would you like me to tell you Who our two impersonator really is ? Oh , please-please , help me . They 've been saying i 've been impersonating two . purpose floor access granted . * coming-coming two by two * * hoorah hoorah These people , they 're my subjects . hey , that 's me . A lot of people trying to get in , ya know ? Is that me ? They 'd kill for my job . When did this happen ? How did it happen ? I started this . I found these people , and i put them into my reports . I did this . I 'm sorry . I have to go . what if i were to tell you that there is another place ? Nobody resigns from summakor ... nobody . They 're selling tickets for your execution , michael , But they 're calling it a promotion . someone 's trying to get inside . There is a place , another place . would you care to see it ? it 's where they sent them . it 's where they sent me and you . whatever you do , stay away from summakor . Hey ! Look up here !

 Hup ! 74 , 75- - General Treister ? Hold on ! 77 ! Bingo . Whoo ! Heh , throw me that towel , son . Squat thrusts ! One for every year this bone bag refuses ... to crawl under the porch and die . Let 's go , big boy ! You better get in step or so help me ... I 'll nail you to the wall of the ladies ' room ! There ya go ! Knew you could do it . Now what can I do you for , my boys ? Ya here to wrestle me ? Eh , no sir , it 's Agent 92-62 . Samson ! That boy 's gonna give me another heart attack . My ninth , if we 're counting . And we are ! What has he done now ? Agent Samson has just turned the O.S.I. list of top assassins ... into the obituary page . Handy if you 're an editor . But a pain in the patoot if you 're me ! Who 's down ? Don 't use that one ! It 's set to record Battlestar Galactica . Number six ... Try to blame me ! Herr Trigger , sniper . Found in a dumpster outside of a strip club . Apparently he 's a bad tipper . Go-fish , at-sea assassin . Body washed up on a public beach . Still waiting for the head . Le Tueur , big game hunter . Presumed dead . He doesn 't answer his cell phone . If you met the guy , you 'd understand . Ehh , too much public killing . In my day , we 'd draw the curtains ... before we punched a man 's time clock . Boys , we gotta put an end ... to this small town talent show ourselves . It 's already gone on well past the fat lady 's encore . What 's our next move , sir ? A-squad vanquisher ... packed to the attic with assault doohickies ! And daddy 's gonna sit in the big chair . Yes , sir . I 'm gonna personally make damn sure ... we end this Samson problem , A-SAP ! Let 's move out ! I should get dressed , I guess . You 'll never get me to talk , pigs . We got you at the scene , covered in the victim 's blood ... with the murder weapon on the floor . You better start flapping ' those gums or you 're lookin ' at life plus 20 , Tralfaz . Um , may I say something ? I 'm not really " with " him ... Ow ! Tralfaz . What is that , Polish ? It 's Spanish for " go fuck yourself . " H-He doesn 't speak for both of us . Ow ! I-I don 't think- - I don 't think that 's true . My wife speaks a little Spanish . Hold on , I 'm gonna call her- - Ow ! Hey ! I 'm sorry , you think maybe we can stick to ... you know , questioning the suspects here ? What is this , the bad cop - retarded cop routine ? OK ! OK ! We 'll tell you everything you want to know ! I 'd like my own counsel . I told you , boys . You 're not under arrest . I just want to ask you a few questions . Let 's start with this " Brock " you keep talking about . Who is he ? He 's our bodyguard . He protects us . Does " Brock " speak to you ? - ' Course . - Both of you ? - Duh . - OK . Does Brock ever ... tell you what to do ? Yeah . Well , sometimes . Sorta . I guess . Mm hmm . And this robot friend of yours , this ... " Helper . " Does he speak to you , too ? One last chance . Where is Venture ? Did he tell us ? It seemed like he was being sarcastic . See , it 's the upwards inflection . It doesn 't really feel like directions . You tell us where Venture is or we break something ... Comprende ? Oh ! Nice move , dick . Oh shit ! I busted him ! Dude , I barely tapped it ! I swear ! I 'm wicked sorry . Don 't apologize ! Now he knows we mean business . Now you tell me Venture 's location or we- - Knock off your head ? Again ... intentionally ! So what 's your relationship ... with this Le Tueur character ? Never heard of him . Oh , maybe this 'll refresh your memory . The stiff in your room split straight up the garanimals ? Eh , good luck picking ' up that spare . W-What the hell is that supposed to mean ? You know , ' cause he cut him in half . It 's like a 7-1 0 split . Like in bowling . But , you know , with a guy . That is ... downright esoteric . I got it right away . You ... shut your mouth . Do we get socked on the lips every time we talk ... or only when we make a point ? Ow . So that 's- - that 's every time then ? Oh , alright . Fine . I 'll tell you everything . - Can I get one of those ? - No . My family and I have been on the run from an elite squad of super-assassins ... who 've been trying to kill our bodyguard since last night . If you don 't let us go so we can help him he 'll probably be dead by morning . Fascinating . Now , if we could ... let 's get back to this giant butterfly . Look , I told you what you want to know . Now gimme my phone call ! OK fine , boys . This is- - this is a good place to take a break . Eh , who would you like to call ? Hello , Pop ? This guy 's a tool . OK , that stung ! I have delicate joints ... You gentlemen are free to go . Uncuff ' em , detectives . Now . Aww , why ? No body , no case . It 's over . Whoa whoa ! What are you talking about no body ? ! That room looked like the set from Saw freakin ' one ! Nope ... The room was down right Martha Stewart . Forensics couldn 't find dick ... except for a faint , eh , lemony fresh kinda odor . I can still smell it . Aaah ! Oh no no ! No , no ! Aaahh ! Let me guess . You 're The Cleaner ? Alright , smart guy . We played it nice . Venture 's location . You have three seconds ... . 2 , 1 ... OK 24 , light him up . Do I connect the positive side first or- - Who cares ? He 's not a Mitsubishi Galant , just do it . What the hell are you doing to him ? Ah ! Honey ? We were just asking him stuff . Oh , you poor sweet thing . Did the bad men hurt you ? Monarch , this goes against the Guild Sentience Conference of 1 998 ! We have to bring him back to his family . Your family must miss you . Let 's find them and get you back to safety . Alright , run these numbers through the NAV-COMM . It 's somewhere in California . That dirty fucking robot got grease all over my dress . Sweetie , your " good-cop " is chilling . That was so hot ... Hot , hot cop . Wee ! ! ! Eh , this is as far as I go . There 's a rental car waiting for you quarter of a mile south of here . Keys and a new I.D. In the glove box , Cochise . Good luck to ya man . Yeah , I uh , only got one problem with that plan- - Hank never called you . I did . Figured even the mighty Brock Samson might have trouble ... fighting the entire O.S.I. Molotov . I don 't know why I 'm surprised . How 'd you find us ? You haven 't exactly been discreet . Oh , like that get-up is ? Though I gotta admit , for a disguise , it 's pretty good . Hardly recognized ya . W-What disg- - ? I 'm off-duty . Ha ha ha ! That 's- - that 's how you dress when you 're not catwoman-ing around ? I might have to rethink this whole relationship . Who 's that hood rat Brock 's talking to ? He can get any shorty he wants . More of your friends , Molotov ? Molotov ? Venture ! Come out , come out wherever you are ... Ugh . Really ? Eh , clich√©d , I know . Trust me , it sounds extra-creepy over the P.A. Hello , Dr. Venture . I hope you don 't mind I called your private number . Your robot gave it to me . And if you ever want to see him alive again you will show yourself . Is he serious ? Deadly ! ! ! You have exactly one minute to- - Aw , check it out . When you turn on night vision with the lights on ... it 's like an X-ray camera . Kinda . Samson ! What in the hell do you think you 're doin ' ? Still breathing , General Treister , sir . No thanks to you . Aw , you 're lookin ' fine , son . Glad to see you finally took that mop top down to regulation . Cut the crap , sir . What do you want from me ? The O.S.I. wants you to come in from the cold , son . It 's high time we had us a li 'l old fashioned pow-wow . And put a stop to this situation . I think we 're way past that , sir . Now , now , now don 't go gettin ' ... all " first blood " on me , boy . You got a family to think about . How long you really think you 're gonna last out there ... in the wilderness with those Ventures ? They 're not part of this . I don 't want them harmed . They won 't be if you just do what we say . Now why don 't you just give us the coordinates ... like a good soldier ... 20 seconds , Venture . What 's it gonna be ? Nineteen ... Alright . I 'll give you what you want . But it goes down the way I say it does . We meet at the Venture Compound . Dawn . Dawn ? ! Ha ! Dean- - We 're finally gonna meet our long lost sister ! Wake up ! We 're here . Gather round my winged flock ! Eh , my breath . Go ! Run ! Head for the panic room quick . And stay low ! Aw , every time something remotely cool happens ... it 's " get in the panic room ! " Unfair ! Alright , alright , can 't I at least change first ? This has to be the most uncomfortable thing I 've ever worn . Today is a day which will live long ... in the annals of Monarch history ! With the sun at our backs we shall- - Uh , M-Monarch- - ? Ah ! Do . Not . Interrupt ! There . You happy now ? Look what you did . Now you don 't get to go on the murder crusade ! Honey , what the hell are we doing here ? This is obviously a trap . Damn right it is ! But whom is trapping whom ? Let 's just say I took the liberty ... of upgrading his precious robot 's equipment ... with two gigabytes of kablam ! The big chair ! Right on schedule . Samson ! Hup bah , what 's the what ? We ready to do this thing ? Well , Venture ... here we are again . Uh , hang on just a sec ' , General . Di- - ? That son of a bitch just put me on hold ? Your fancy new plane won 't save you , Venture . We 're having this out , here and now once and for all ! Oh , I couldn 't agree with you more , Monarch . Why don 't ya come on around back and say hello ? I 'd be delighted . Sugar crown , we don 't even know what that thing can do . Oh , sweetness ... Why do you think we have henchmen ? Besides , he 's Rusty Venture not the O. S. Freaking I. Anything he can throw at us we can throw back tenfold ! Sorry ' bout that , General . What were ya , tying ' yer boots ? Are you comin ' out or are ya gonna make us ... come in there and get you ? Won 't be necessary , sir . I 'm a comin ' around now ... Uh , sir ? Can we get an order here ? Fire ! Who the hell are those guys ? They 're henchmen for the Monarch , sir . What in the hell 's a Monarch ? Low level Guild troublemaker . Used to arch Dr. Venture . Then he arched Dr. Venture . Aw , come on , General . That any way to treat my friends ? Those clowns are with you ? What in hell is going on here , Samson ? Just tryin ' to even the playing field a little , sir . Looks like Samson 's gone over to the Guild , sir . Want me to give the order to take out the big cocoon ? Is that what that thing is ? Jeepers crappers , no . If Samson 's pulled a full-on Judas there 's no tellin ' ... what kinda trade secrets he might 've given up . I want him alive . Ground forces ! Henchmen ! Form battle squadrons ... and prepare for full assault on my order ! I told you ... - We should just leave already . - Oh stop yourself . Moppets ! Prepare my Death 's Head Panoply ! There it is again ! I 'm telling ya there 's like a skunk ape out there or something . Hank , sit down and pretend to be sane . Dean , what are you doing ? I can 't feel my left arm . How old do you have to be to have a heart attack ? In regular years , or pansy years ? Whatever ! Why ! ? Why can 't I just have a normal life ? I had that dream once too . Open up ! Aahh ! Sergeant Hatred ! What the hell is he doing here ? You 're just gonna let him in ? He 's Pop 's arch enemy ! Yeah technically , like on paper . Hello , ladies . Where 's your old man at ? Behind those boxes . Hiding from you . - Thanks , Hank . - There you are ! OK , you have to kill me . I 've been here for like two days trying to do it myself . I tried to blow my head off with a damn shrink ray . Now I got a little baby tongue . I 'm a failure . What 's wrong with him ? He 's having a heart attack . Look Nelly-boy , you don 't know of heart pain ! I 've tried to change . I quit the sauce , the cigars , the young boys . And she still left me ! Mister Hatred , could you stop yelling please ? Honestly . Come on , man ! Kill me ! ! ! Attack . Attack ! ! Attaack ! ! Tortilla chip ? They are not only cool , they are ranch . Totally . What are you doing ? I 'm creating realistic battle damage . So when we join them at the end ... it 'll look like I 've seen some action . It 'll look like rubbed snack on your face . Oh ! Listen to that ! Did you just hear that guy ? That guy right there . That is a guy on fire ! You can totally tell . What the ! ? Ah crap , he 's stealing our hiding place ! Dude ! Bail ! Come on ! I can 't ! My seat belt is jammed ! Why 'd you buckle it ? ! Why would you do that ! ? I don 't know ! Why did you buckle up ! ? Why ? ! Just choke me ! Choke my neck ! Damn you ! Strangle my pain away ... please ! Look , crazy . So your teen bride left you . Big whoop . Is she really worth ending everything- - Hank ! What are you doing ? ! I 'm going out there . Brock needs me ! That boy is not even close to a chip off the old block . He 's got guts ! Excuse me ? You don 't know me . Why in my prime , I saw some things ... that would make your head spin . Yeah , I saw a guy 's head spin . Like right off his neck . Why ? Because I punched him ! Top that ! OK ... OK ! My father made me kill a man- - kill a man with a house key ! - I was ten ! - Oh , that 's nothing ! I ate a whole Labrador Retriever once ! I 'm serious ! Blah , blah ! All this talk ! We gotta do something ! Brock is being attacked by his friends . Your real arch enemy is trying to kill you ... and you 're swapping war stories with Sergeant Kill Me ! Wow ! I like this one . - And he is right . - He 's crazy . He 's gonna get us killed ! No , he has got something . Look at us . We are hiding from our true selves . I 'm a fighter , not a lover ! And you ... you were Rusty Venture once . Maybe the most fearless Boy Adventurer ever . Maybe the most ? And Hank here ... Hank is becoming a man . I can feel it in my bones ! And Dean ... Dean is- - Sensitive . He 'll come around ! Now let 's get out there and show those frail flowers ... who the hell they 're dealing with ! Let 's pretend this is a good idea . We 'd need an army- - We 've got one ! Hank , there are only four- - um , three and a half of us . Not if you let me open my Christmas gifts early ... there aren 't . Ten - hut ! Left left ... left right left ... left left ... left right left ! Company halt ! He did it ! Sgt. Hatred saved the day ! And we helped ! Kinda ! Go Team Venture ! ! ! Oh , God ! Oh , no no no ! Whoa whoa whoa ! Cease fire ! Cease fire ! Alright look just ... just put your weapons down ! I give up , OK ? Now let me talk to General Treister . All right put me here , and give me the megaphone . Hold it up for me . I - I can 't move my arms . Enemies of the Monarch ! Behold my impressive Death 's Head Panoply ! The final solution in tailoring ! Recoil in terror ... as the mighty Monarch goes supernova ! Oh , sweet tights , not that . You never tested it . You are gonna kill yourself . Why do you always have to take that last step over the crazy edge ? And now I write this battle 's final chapter ... with the blood of my enemies ! It 's the little button on the sleeve . Well , there 's my life 's work up in smoke . Oh , God ! I feel like I 'm the one dying . We should be out there with them ! We should be fighting side by side ... with our moist warrior brethren ! ! Ah , ba ba ba . Just take it down a notch , Hank . You only live once . Aah ! Aaaah ! Aaaaahhhh ! Help ! Help help ! Oh , God . Sure got a funny way of thanking ' people , Samson . Fly all the way here to save your butt and what do we get ? Face full of moth people ! They 're butterflies , sir . Really ? 'The hell I 'm thinking of , then ? - Emperor moths ? - Whoa , whoa , whoa . What are you talkin ' about , savin ' my butt ? You sicced those three goons on it ! And then when they weren 't enough you came here to finish the job yourselves . Boy , I don 't know what the hell you 're talkin ' about . All I know is when O.S.I. hears one of its baby chicks is in trouble ... Momma comes a-runnin' and a-squawkin , and a-runnin . That 's how we do . Then you didn 't uh ... you 're not ... I was never ... Ah shit . Son , I believe your mind has gone AWOL . I shoulda seen this comin ' . Your work 's been gettin ' sloppy across the board , boy . Public killins ' , abuse of company property- - and none of your reports on Dr. Venture ... ever mentioned nuthin 'bout no illegal clone farm . You ... you send them reports about me ? Maybe you 've been on this detail too long . Why don 't you come back with us ... so we can find you a nice , new assignment ? Maybe something ' a little easier on the ol ' noggin ' ? Thank you . No , sir . I 've seen enough spinning butterfly ... naked boy armies ... Screw this . I 'd rather , uh , quit . Yeah , you tell him , Brock ! Well good for you ! O.S.I. , who needs ' em ? Where are you going ? Aren 't you going to help clean up this mess ? I said I quit . You know ... I could use a job . Hey , Monarch ! Huh ? I 'm takin ' your fuckin ' car . Oh . Yeah , yeah . Twenty Four ! Nooo ! ! ! Ow ! So much for our competition . Congratulations , ladies . Just as we planned ... we are now the top assassins in the country . The Blackhearts Elimination Agency ... is officially open for business . Thanks to Mr. Brock Samson . To Brock Samson ! Long live that blonde haired ...

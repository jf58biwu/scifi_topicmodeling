 We 're not a threat . We 're salvation . The world will have to deal with us . I 'm not your little brother anymore . Then stop acting like a two-Year-Old . You 're my brother . She 's your girlfriend . It 's all good . You goddamn freak ! Danny , stop it ! Stop blaming me for nikki ! Diana skouris , Your adoption of maia rutledge is hereby complete . He 's gonna die . I saw it . He 's gonna die . Jordan collier ? Someone 's going to kill him . No ! No ! His body , it 's not there ! This is your new house ? It 's yours too . I 've been looking forward to this moment for too long . Only one thing missing- - Mom . We really tried to make it work . How was your first day of college ? I didn 't have one . Nobody paid my tuition . I 'm sorry , kyle . I must have forgot . You 've been talking about this for months . How could you forget ? You spent three years in a coma . You have no business drinking anything ! You told me everything that happened that night , right ? Yeah . Any coffee left ? Help yourself . Couldn 't find a clean t-Shirt ? This is what i wear to school . I like it . You 're looking sharp . Thanks . So ... How you doing , dad ? Good . Fine . Why ? No reason . Just , uh ... You know , good luck . Okay ? I 'll be thinking about you . I 'll call you . See how it goes . Okay ? See you . Hey , there he is ! What 's all this ? Welcome back . The prodigal son returns . Returns from where ? Get your gear on . We got to roll . Tom , i am so glad to see you . Yeah , you and everyone else . As soon as we take doherty down , We 're going to pop the champagne . Doherty ? Who 's doherty ? Diana , stop . Fill me in here . Who 's doherty ? Does he have something to do with collier 's murder ? What , governor collier ? What are you talking about ? He 's not dead . This was garrity 's idea , right ? Got to admit , it 's creative , But " screw with tom baldwin day " is over . Hey , listen , tom , don 't do this . The doctors gave you a clean bill of health . Doctors ? What doctors ? Where is everybody headed ? And what the hell is going on around here today ? I think you should probably just stay here . We 'll talk when i get back . Diana , just- - So , this guy , doherty , is he a 4400 ? What 's a 4400 ? Please , stop this . Four thousand , four hundred missing people ... The future sent them back in a ball of light . Any of this sound familiar ? Diana , i 'm not laughing , So whatever game you 're playing , Stop it , and stop it right now . Tom , whatever you 've been through In the past few months , I can 't even imagine it , And everyone here is pulling for your recovery , But you 've got to listen to yourself . You sound delusional . The future ? I mean , i 've never heard of the 4400 , And i can promise you That nobody ever came back in a ball of light . Tell me one thing . According to you , What have we been doing for the last year ? You 're serious . Humor me . It 's your case , tom . Dirty bombs , remember ? You went undercover And infiltrated an aum shinrikyo terror cell . None of this means anything to you , does it ? Of course not . Why should it ? Well , your cover was compromised . They held you for three weeks . Sleep deprivation , torture- - They 'd have killed you if you didn 't escape . So how does doherty fit in ? Aum shinrikyo 's been planning an attack on the u.S. Since they 've been sneaking radioactive material Into the country in museum pouches . Doherty 's the curator . He 's been in bed with them all along . Tom , he sold you out . You spent three weeks in hell 'cause of this guy . You 've been on medical leave For two months , recovering , and ... Obviously , it should have been three . Jordan collier museum of contemporary art . Tell me you recognize this place . I recognize it , all right ... Well , that 's a start . But everything 's different . This is the spot . This is where collier got shot . Do me a favor . Don 't let anyone else hear you say that . Tom ? Tom ! Is he in there ? Yeah , i think so . You want to do the honors ? Did you find anything ? Somebody 's been messing with my computer . All my case files are gone . I type " 4400 " into a search engine , and ... Nothing . How could there not be a single mention of them ? I don 't know . Maybe because ... None of it ever happened ? Something has obviously changed . This is not the same world that it was yesterday . But i 'm still tom baldwin , And you 're still diana skouris , Which means that the people they took , They exist too , right ? Gary navarro . We worked with him last month . He could read thoughts . Read thoughts ? Tom , come on . Played for cincinnati ? Lifetime .317 batting average . Isn 't it .300 When you know what the pitcher 's thinking ? But ... he was never taken ! Richard tyler . What did he have ? Heat vision ? No , some of them can do ... things . Some of them ... some of them can 't . He 's dead . He 's plane was shot down over sinanju in 1951 . So that 's two down . Are we going to go through all 4,398 more ? I 'll take my boots off if we are . Diana , your daughter . Your daughter ! Your daughter , maia rutledge . You adopted her , right ? She 's one of them . Tom , don 't include me in your fantasy life . You know i don 't have a daughter . Yes ! Right here . It 's a seattle address for maia rutledge . It 's right here . Right here . Oh , thank god . Maia , it 's me . It 's me , tom . Tom baldwin . I don 't know you . Don 't say that , please . - Don 't say that . - My name is ella . Maia 's my grandmother . Ella , who is it ? Oh , here she is . This is my grandmother . You 're maia rutledge ? Can i help you ? Didn 't expect you home so soon . How 'd you do out there today ? Glad to see you , too . Everything okay ? Just tell me one thing . You were in a coma for three years , right ? If i have one more of these , I could wind up in a coma right now . Come on . I want to show you something . Come on . Uncle tommy . We can eat , finally . How you doing ? Shawn , what are you doing here ? Well , the band got delayed in berlin . We 're not going to start recording until tuesday . Besides , i couldn 't miss your big day . Or danny 's . Come on , tell them . Believe it or not , she actually said " yes . " We 're getting married . Look , he bought me this ! Oh , i told him i didn 't even want one Till he was out of law school . I like that . You like that ? Are you all right , mr . Baldwin ? Dad , do you need to sit ? It can 't be a joke . There 's too many people in on it . Sit down . So then either i 'm cracking up , Or the world is . Dad , the doctors said you were okay . I don 't want to scare you , but something 's wrong . I don 't recognize this place . I mean , i sort of do , But everything 's been tweaked . Dad , dad , look at me . You 're not making any sense . You know that , right ? You guys started without us ? Just as well . Airport traffic was insane . Hi , guys , nikki . Can you believe my kid , my youngest kid , Is getting married ? When the hell did we get so old ? So you 're back in the saddle . How 'd it go ? I don 't think it went too good . Really ? I was just telling your wife That you were going to be fine . My wife ? I 'm still married to linda ? I said wife , not ex-Wife . Alana , over here . Come here . I 've never seen this woman before . I think we need to be alone ... Go upstairs . Talk . No . I don 't know who you are . Dad , alana 's your wife . You 've been married to her for two years . She lives here , dad . I don 't know what any of you are talking about , but it 's over . It 's over , it 's over . How 'd you find me ? Guys downstairs called . They said you 've been here four hours . Yeah . Sad , isn 't it ? The only place i feel normal Is hiding in a storage closet . I guess that 's what it must feel like to be insane- - You 're not insane , tom . You just need a rest . Everyone keeps telling me i was tortured . Maybe they broke my mind . You 're going to come back from this , tom . It 's just going to take some time . And i 'm going to help you , i promise . So tell me again about this ball of light . When did you first come to believe it happened ? August 14th , 2004 . That 's when they came back . Maybe not in the world you know , but it happened in mine- - Get her out of here ! No one 's plotting against you , tom . I did what i had to do to get you better . His wife 's here . She 's asking to see him . I am not married . I am not married ... Look , lady , i don 't know who you are , And i don 't care what you have to say . You have to play along . I need you to get out of here So we can figure out what 's going on . What are you talking about ? None of this is real to me , either . I know we 're not married . I 've never seen you before yesterday . The things you talk about- - The ball of light , The 4400 ... You know about the 4400 ? Know of them ? I am a 4400 . Ow my behavior was totally out of line , And i want to apologize . I got fixated on getting back to work , And obviously , the strain , the , uh ... The excitement , it was just too much . We 're going to extend your medical leave By another six weeks , And then we will see about getting you back out in the field . I 'll circle the date . Okay . So i can go now ? Your psych hold is over . Great . I 'm ... i 'm sorry for the ambush . Desperate times , desperate measures . I 'll see you in six weeks . Tom baldwin . Alana mareva . So i guess we 're married . So i 'm told . Let 's go home . See if we can figure out what the hell is going on . - Where do you think we are ? - I don 't know . Maybe we crossed into some kind of ... Alternate reality , a different dimension . I know . It sounds insane . It sounds impossible . Impossible isn 't what it used to be , and ... You 're a 4400 . You think i 'm doing this ? It 's an explanation . A pretty simple one , actually . Simple , but wrong . If i were making this up , Why would i put myself in the middle of your life ? I 'm sorry.This can 't be easy for you , either . Yeah , easy . My friends , my family , everything i know is gone . Erased . I 'm trapped in the middle of your life . How do i know it 's not you making this up ? Erased ? What do you mean , your life has been erased ? I used to own this place . I bought it four years ago , A few months before i was abducted . And none of this looks familiar now ? I was my own buyer . I flew all over the world And bought mostly sculptures , Primitive art . Excuse me . Can i talk to the owner ? He 's not here today . Any idea when he opened this place ? A long time ago . 15 , maybe 20 years . It only gets worse . You 're sure that 's the right bench ? I used to come here every week . Believe me , i know which bench i dedicated To my husband and son . So back in the world we came from ... They died ... In a car accident ... Shortly before i was abducted . There 's a way back home . We 're going to find it . If you need anything , i 'll be right down the hall . What , you 're sleeping in the guest room ? Under the circumstances , yeah . I don 't think that 's a good idea . We have to play along . We 're supposed to be happily married . We don 't want your son asking questions . Okay , i 'll , uh , find a spot on the floor . Are you sure you wouldn 't be more comfortable in the bathtub ? I 'm kidding , thomas . It 's a big bed . I 'm sure we can keep in our own sectors . Do you think we 're the only ones ? Are there other people out there like us , Wondering how they got here ? If there are , we 'll find them . We 'll take out classified ads In every major city paper . " Remember the 4400s ? Drop us a line . " We 'll check out every returnee we can find . Tell me something about yourself . What do you want to know ? Favorite records ? Where i went to school ? How about your husband and son ? What were they like ? Paul was a radiologist . We met while he was on vacation in tahiti . That 's where i 'm from . Linda and i thought about going there for our honeymoon . We picked haiti instead . Two years later , After we were married , we had billy . He was so quiet and sweet . This is unbelievable . I think this was the interview Where i said i wanted to go into medicine Because nurses are sexy . You did not say that . I got into medical school ! Stanford , baby ! Congratulations . The real kyle used to talk about being a doctor all the time . Right up until he went into a coma . " The real kyle ... " I know that 's not exactly your son , But he seems pretty real to me . He gets happy when he hears good news , Cranky when he gets tired , And he forgets to put the toilet seat down . He 's a good kid . He was raised well . I got a response from our ad in the post . Philip kendrick . He wants to meet us . Philip kendrick ? Tom baldwin . What do you remember about the 4400 ? It was the best sedan citroen ever put out . Hydraulics came standard on every model- - You 're talking about a car ? Yeah ! Mine 's parked outside . Where 's yours ? It 's in the shop . I 'll send you a picture . Uh , tom , i don 't have your address . Well , that was productive . Yeah ... Should we check out the blake exhibit While we 're here ? Uh ... yeah , why don 't you ... Why don 't you go ahead ? I 'll catch up with you in a minute . No , it 's ... Thomas ... Thomas ... Thomas ? Thomas ! It 's gone . What 's gone ? That door . It was back . And i opened it this time . It was some kind of operating room , i think . I didn 't see anything like that . You were just standing there like a statue . That room 's the answer . It has to be . It 's the only thing that doesn 't fit . It 's not part of this reality . If it even exists . You 're the only one who can see it- - I have to get back there . Hey , partner . Black , two sugars . So the guards tell me That you spent ... Five hours here yesterday , Three the day before that , And , one saturday , you logged up 12 . Yeah , so i like art . It 's a nice , functional door , tom , But i wouldn 't call it a work of art . Now , maybe if it were made of black obsidian ... I read your psych file . You planning on having me locked up again , diana ? You know , this other reality That you 're anxious to get back to ? I mean , even if you could get back to it , It doesn 't sound that great , tom . Back there , you were divorced . Here , you have a beautiful wife . Back there , you son , kyle , Spent four years in a coma . Here , he 's about to spend four in medical school . Back there , your sister 's family is completely dysfunctional , Your nephew is in a cult , And the future of the world is in jeopardy . You make it sound so ... bleak . It 's just a ... Just life . This is life , And it 's a better life for you and for everyone you care about . Just accept what you have . Because if you don 't , Well , you 're going to spend the rest of your life Just sitting in this hallway . Alana ? What 's the matter ? Have you seen these pictures ? Look at all the things we 've done together . You know , you 'd think if we 're trapped here , They would give us these memories . You know ? Look , we 've been to china . I 've wanted to go my entire life to china . Look , alana , i don 't know how long it 's going to take For us to get out of here . I don 't know . Who says we will ? You keep talking about that door . It 's been a month already . What if it never comes back ? Then we 're trapped , okay , then we 're trapped . I don 't ... But if we are , alana , I promise you , we will make new memories . Just as good as these . Better . Oh , i believe we could , thomas . I like it when you call me that . " Thomas . " And this goes up , and then ... Ugh , i can never get these things right . Let me take a shot . Come here . Hold still . You got to remember to make big loops . Leave yourself a little room to work with . Hands of a surgeon . Hands of a resident , more like . No , you 'll get there . So how do you like it over at st . Bede 's ? The hours are killer . Doctors treat me like a glorified candystriper . A good night 's sleep is a distant memory . I love it . Well , i look like i belong On top of a wedding cake . Hey , you brought this on yourself . Some people go to fiji for their 10th anniversary . You two wanted to renew your vows . Yeah , well , the first time Just felt like pictures in a book . This one ... This one is for me and alana . Ready to go , champ ? And do you , alana baldwin , Also renew your commitments to honor , obey , And love your husband , thomas , Till death do you part ? I do . Then by the power vested in me , I now pronounce you still man and wife . Go ahead.You may kiss your beautiful bride . I 'm getting in here . Oh , i love you guys . So how do you feel , mrs . Baldwin ? Married . Finally . Feels real now , huh ? Well , it felt real for a long time . It 's hard to believe we resisted it . Do you miss it ? Your old life ? I still think about it , But after all these years , That life , that world- - That feels like the delusion . I know . I have to concentrate To even remember a life without you . See , i 'm good that way . Like a cellphone or tivo . Once you 've got me , You can 't imagine not having me . I love you , thomas . It still kills me when you call me that . Come here , woman . You 're resigning ? I 'm moving on , tom . I 've been here 11 years . The private sector beckons . Dennis ryland offered me A partnership in his consulting firm . Nice gig . So you 're moving to virginia ? Three weeks . Look , d.C. Has asked me to submit a list of names As potential replacements . I 'm giving them one . Yours . Well , i 'm- - I 'm flattered . I , uh ... But you might need a backup or two . I mean , somewhere in my personnel file Are measurements for my straitjacket . Nah , you were convalescing From injuries received in the line of duty . Your service in that case was heroic . I think you can talk your way around the fallout . That is , if you want the job . A chance to sit in the big chair ? I want it , all right . Good . Then practice saying , " nice to meet you too , senator . " Best way to prep for your confirmation hearing . I 'll spring for a new suit . My last act as head of this division Will be to make sure that this happens . Congratulations , tom . You 've earned this . Thank you . Guess what . Don 't tell me . You just spoke to jarvis . You knew ? She might have mentioned something . And you didn 't tell me ? I 'm transferring you to greenland . Oh , look , he 's not even confirmed yet , And he 's mad with power . Baldwin . Hey , you 're not going to believe this . They 've just asked me to join the board of directors At the collier museum . Wow . That 's ... quite an honor . Do you think i should take it ? The best museum on the west coast . You got to take it . There 's a benefit At the seattle inner city arts council on friday night . They want to introduce me around . I didn 't put my tux back into storage . So it , um ... Looks like we both got a little surprise at the office today . What do you mean ? Are you sitting down ? Just tell me , thomas . Honey , i 'll see you at home tonight . Glendon ritter , C.E.O. Of stradwick pharmaceuticals . Isn 't he president of the arts council ? Well , you should go say hello . You come with . No , no , you ... you go . I 'm all out of small talk . Go ahead . Mr. Ritter . So happy you could make it . Thomas ? Do you see it ? No . Why ? You do ? It 's been gone for eight years . Why now ? Come back downstairs with me . That 's the way out . It ... It has to be . And if it is ... And you walk through it ... What happens to all of this ? To us ? I don 't know . And i don 't want to find out . I want to go to washington next month , And i want to watch you get promoted . I want to see who kyle marries . So do i ... But this door , it 's ... It 's back for a reason . It 's like it wants me to walk through it . But do you want to walk through it ? I don 't want you to , either . Come on , thomas . Let 's go home . Kyle ! No , kyle 's my son ! Leave me alone ! He 's my son ! Kyle ! Stop . Let go of me ! What ... Congratulations . You made it . Where are we ? I think you know . This is where they brought you ... And the rest of the 4400 . Yes , this is where they altered us- - Gave me the ability To create the world we 've been living in For the last eight years . So it is you . You 've been doing this the whole time . We 've been living in my mind , But the instructions for your reality Came from them . They created a sanctuary for you , An easier , less complicated world . But none of it 's real . You are . I am . The feelings we have for each other are As real as anything we 've ever experienced . Is that why they did this ? Kept us here for eight years ? Because they wanted us to fall in love ? Moments . That 's all that 's passed , But in those few seconds , We 've accumulated years of memories That will bond us in the real world . I thought they were worried about saving the world , Not playing matchmaker . They 're worried about you . Your life is about to plunge into crisis . Your mission will be threatened . They can 't allow this to happen . They gave you this relationship as a source of strength , To sustain you In the trials that lay ahead . What crisis ? What- - What is it ? Why can 't they just tell me what it is ? I can stop it from happening . It 's already begun ... But now you won 't have to face it alone . No , if it 's started , i have to get back there . Only your wife can get you home . You are my wife . No . I 'm part of the program they placed in her mind . She has no idea she 's creating this . If she did , It would interfere with the bonding . So , what , i 'm supposed to just fill her in And tell her what ? Whether she knows it or not , She 's willing this world into existence . She can will it out of existence . Yeah , and what if she doesn 't want to ? You have to convince her . That will be the first test of your relationship . They 've created a damn near perfect world for me . What if i don 't want to leave ? Then the future picked the wrong man . What about kyle ? He spent nine years becoming a doctor . What , am i supposed to get rid of him ? Wish him away ? It 's not really kyle . Don 't say that ! If it 's not kyle , Who 's moving around downstairs in the kitchen ? Kyle . Shawn . Danny . None of them are real . They 're just projections . You 've spent eight years with these people . They 're as real to you as they are to me . I love my family . I really do love them . It 's not that i want to do this . It 's that we have to do it . But they 're my family , too . Back there , i 'm just a stranger to them . What about you and me ? Our life ? Is that a projection , too ? No . What we have , our memories , They 'll carry over into the real world . But it won 't be the same . It can 't be . Maybe not , But whatever we have , it 'll be real . What are you doing ? Make it go away . What do i do ? Stare at it until it disappears ? No , just believe it 's not there . Well , thanks for coming , everybody . Alana and i just wanted to tell you all that ... We 're going to be leaving . We 're taking a vacation . We 'll be gone for a while , and , uh ... I know it 's sudden , But we just decided this morning . Well , how long is a while ? I mean , you just got the biggest promotion of your career . It 'll have to wait . We wanted to see you all one last time before we go , And tell you ... How much we love you . That 's so sweet . Careful , alana . She 's going to be crying in a second . It 's something we have to do . It 's a ... It 's a trip that we 've been talking about for a long time . Where are you going ? Not far . Well ... Send us a postcard ... At least . To the people we love . You have no idea how much we will miss you . We will miss you , too . Don 't look back . Tom ? Tom ? Are you with me , tom ? Can you email me the mareva file ? Alana mareva ? Yeah , a.K.A. Returnee 2155 . She was just here doing her med eval . It 's my week to do reports , Remember ? Diana , the 4400 , the ball of light , It happened , right ? Should i be worried about you- - - Just tell me it happened . - Yes , of course it happened . What else have we been doing here the last year ? That 's great . My god . Thank you . Thank you . Alana . Alana ! Alana ! Alana , wait ! Thomas .

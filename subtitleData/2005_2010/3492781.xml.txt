Create the child . Create the child . Look at her . Another weak link , just like the others . And choose to spit out and not to use any longer fresh , if she does miss the carry first . Patience . That 's we get stronger , so do the babies . Well , not one of them must fight for more than couple days . This page will be different . Look at this healthy child . Before the ninth ? We are running out the time . She is not cooperating . Some of them won 't eat meat or drink the wine . We can 't risk taking the child . This one is very close . Then what ? Another dead one for sharing ? Or maybe this time we would be lucky and we would only have two arms and two legs . You took this on . You made the choice years ago . You wouldn 't given us this job if you didn 't think we can do it . Of course . You 're right . September ninth is so close . And finally we can leave here for eternity . That 's better . There 're so much to look forward to . Please let me out . Please . You can 't just keep me here forever . People will miss me . She 's almost too . I can 't wait to be doing with this . I won 't tell anybody . I promise . I will give you anything . Just please let me and my baby out . Just becoming so tedious . Becoming ! I 've got some lovely wine . I just can 't wait for her to try it . No , please don 't go . Please ! Please ! Shut up ! How did you know that I just want you ? All that chilling really gets you going . You want some more ?

Next time , he comes and bring one of the other girls . I 'm getting bored . Bored my ass . It 's me . What the hell you think you 're doing out here in this town at night ? You want to get yourself killed ? We need to talk . Now . I see you 're starting to remember . There is something about it . That 's right , honey . You worked for that band . Jack ! Good ! The ash is running off . Ash ? What are you talking about ? Take it easy . You don 't get something from nothing around here . Tell me . You got promised to get me out of here . I promise . Then you tell me what the hell is going on . What is this place ? Benedict , Elizabeth and Armon , They are witches . They kill people . They killed your friend . Gibbs ? Not Gibbs . He has eating and drinking and having great all times . I can 't . Remember . I know . There was a man . Some man with the beard . Jack ? He is dead . Jack is dead ? They killed all the ones first . No stand with it now . What about the rest of us ? Right now , that 's not important . The important thing is to get out . I tried ! I can 't fucking leave here ! I can 't leave . Why can 't I leave here ? Because you signed the book . Once you signed the book , that 's it . It 's like you signed your life away . They want you eat and drink , the ash just makes it easy . The ash is in the food and drink ? It 's like some kind of mind control . The ash just make you forget . But not me . Why ? Because I made damn sure your food is clean . That 's why . When you saw this ... Shit ! He takes the drugs on us . The food and the wine . Thanks for my screw-up liver . No wine for Jacky boy . You have to make this all kind sounds a little bit crazy ? When do we get here ? When do we get here ? According to you it 's .. No , when do you remember getting here ? Yesterday Okay , what 's the day that date ? It 's Thursday . October twenty-third . Thursday . I took this from the couple that showed up yesterday . Whenever , whenever . Roy and Susan something or other ? October , right ? Read the date . April fourth . Two thousand nine . We have been here for six months ? I think time is altered . Maybe a day here is a week outside or a month . I don 't know ! How did you know we haven 't figured this out all before ? We don 't know . Well ! That 's just fucking great ! That 's great . We should remember now . Oh my god ! How do we get out of here ? That nasty old van , you know Charon the driver ? Don 't even think about taking that van . Charon 's the only one can get to the portal . Even Benedict , the others either cannot , until ... Until when ? That 's enough . You just get back like everyone else . Don 't let on that your memory is coming back or else we were both dead . Wait ! How do I know I can trust you ? I worship God . Help me . How did you find me ? Do I know you ? I will be back . I promise . No ... Elizabeth wants to see you . Sure . Baby . Now ! You better save some to me . I will think about it . Lucky you . Hooke . Please . Please no .

Don 't you remember ... Gibbs ! Jesus Christ ! You gotta remember ! Gibbs , you gotta come with me now . Now ! Now ! Fuck ! I will make this really easy for you . You give me the keys . You leave . You don 't remember , do you ? No , you don 't remember . You will never leave here . No one would make me pass the portal . Why is that ? It 's magic . Baby . No one but me can leave Mercy . Not until ... Until ... till to when ? Until the child was born . Those cages ! Those women ! Those women are breeding ! The babies were born and dead would be done . You rapped them ! Not me !

I didn 't even know you are gone . It wasn 't you , Hooke . You remember ? No meat , no wine , not knowing why you 're pregnant . I think this ash will hurt the baby . We gotta get you out of here . There is a key in the stand by the door . I miss you . What about the others ? Gibbs and Jack ? Jack is dead . God ! This is so evil ! No , we would never get out of here ! We just come back and I can 't go back to that cage ! I can 't ... Listen . Listen . We can get out of here , all right ? Everyone . You , me , Gibbs . We can get out of here but you need to be strong , understand ? Going somewhere ? I can smell your when you get in the door . Get out of my way , lady . You solve the riddle and maybe I will let you go . What will the world look like at night , night all night . I don 't give a shit ! I 'll give you a hand . It 's not real ! None of this is real ! C 'mon ! We go . Wait ! Wait ! We can 't just leave these women like this . Get out of here . Let 's go . Good luck . What about the others ? Believe me , I tried .

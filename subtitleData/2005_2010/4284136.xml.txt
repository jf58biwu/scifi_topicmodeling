 My condition is unprecedented . Nothing like this has ever happened before . Don 't ! Just stop , just stop now ! Why ? Tell me , Daddy , what 's the big deal about Claire ? Oh , Daddy ! - I 'm not married to you ! - Yes , you are . Get used to it ! Klein Utterson exist to follow you . You are its sole purpose . No , for God 's sake , no ! Please ! No ! - You have some questions ? - A few , yes . You have my husband in a box ! - It 's Hyde we want . - So , who is he now ? How do you know which one he 's stabilised as ? We open the box . Sorry , Poole . Mislaid my keys . Good morning , Dr Jekyll . We weren 't sure when you 'd be returning . Will you be requiring breakfast ? No , I think I 've eaten . I have ... I 've eaten - Any messages ? - The same gentleman as before . He said he would call back , after ten o 'clock this evening . Gentlemen do not call after ten o 'clock . I could contact the police . Alice said his manner was odd . I have business with this man . We are ... connected . - He spoke to Alice ? - The maid , yes , sir . He came to the kitchen door this time . I 'll talk to her . Is she still in the kitchen ? I could send for her . Alice ? You had a caller today . He 's coming back tonight . Ten o 'clock tonight . Mr Hyde scares me . Mr Hyde scares me very much . But not half as much as that man today and his questions . " The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde . " My wife thinks I should throw it in the fire . But my publisher is interested . You called at the house while I was out today . You spoke with the maid . Yes . I 'm sorry , background details , you know . I have provided you with sufficient details . You have kept within the limits of what we agreed ? I have elaborated for colour , altered for economy . It has the appearance of a fiction , but the substance of the facts , just as you wished . It lacks only an ending . - An ending will present itself shortly . - How ? I will die . I can no longer control the changes . I thought you said the potion controlled the changes . At the beginning , yes . Hyde comes when he chooses now . Each time he weakens me , reduces me . I can feel it . - I 'm sorry . - I 'm not . If I die , he dies too . People are not stupid , this tale is not in my normal style . There are those , a few , who might suspect its origins in truth . In a tale of a potion that can transform its hero into a demon ... I am not a hero . And it is not a tale . Such an account might set some thinking about this potion . There are those who would wish to possess such a thing . I know . Then why should this tale be told ? It is not a tale . It is a trap . The secret of this potion , you are certain it is known to you alone ? Oh , yes . You are wrong . It is known to one other . Who ? Me . I only want to know if I 'm right . One never quite knows who 's listening . The secret of Doctor Jekyll 's potion . Nothing will appear in my account . You can trust me . You will tell no one ? You have my word . It dies with you . Doctor Jekyll 's last secret . Oh , Tom ... Oh , my God . You 've chained him . Claire ? - Tom ... - Claire , be careful . Help me , Claire . - I can 't see your face . - I can 't move . I need to see your face . I can 't move my head . - Paralysis ? - No , it can 't be . Tom ? Why have you chained him ? Thing is ... - If he stabilised as Hyde , well ... - What ? - He 'd be more extreme . - Worse . - Stronger . - He doesn 't look stronger to me . Claire . It 's me . Please , it 's me . I can 't move . Our honeymoon ... where did we go ? What ? You heard me . Our honeymoon . Name of the hotel . The Appleyard . The Appleyard ... room 702 . We could see the church from the window , the spire . Do you know what ? I 'd forgotten the room number . - Oh ... - Claire ... You know what ? Not too close . He hasn 't . The doctor is out ! Security ! Get security in here , now ! He 's out of my head ! Hallelujah ! Home alone ! Oh , this feels good . Roomy . Look at all this space . I could put up shelves . Where is he ? Where 's my husband ? He was in here a minute ago . Turn my back and whoosh ! Not even a tip on the dresser . Men ! Oh , this feels so peaceful , love it . No more boring doctor yapping away in the corner . You 've got no idea . " Don 't do this , don 't do that , don 't kill her , your turn to shave ... " And if I 'd had one more argument about who was biting the fingernails ... oh ! Did that bug you , the fingernails ? Did he do that when he was with you ? We should talk , you and me , we 're fellow sufferers . We should have a cup of coffee and a good old chinwag about him . The wife and the ex . Girls together . All friends now the bastard 's dead . How can he be dead ? You 're still here . How can he be dead ? Hello again , Mr Hyde . Appreciate it if you kept right where you are . The thing about consuming your alter ego , bit like a Chinese , minute later you 're hungry again . Hello , boys . Mr Hyde , no one here means you any harm , but we do need to examine you . The thing is ... basically , you may not be stabilised yet . It 's for your own good . Basically . Ok , Mr Basically , talk to me like you know me again , in public , where people can see , and the next sound you hear will be your own neck snapping . Do we now have a basis for communication ? Mr Hyde . - Step away from Dr Gilligan . - Yeah ... Ah-ah ... necketty neck-neck ! - Sorry . - Mr Hyde . Please , step away from Dr Gilligan . We don 't want to hurt you . I can smell your sweat . Vegetarian . Woof ! You 've got a dog . Woof-woof . Two dogs . Big dogs . I want to say Alsatian . Is he correct , Colonel Hart ? Yes , sir . He 's correct . Hmm , tasty . 57 years old , ex-smoker , gave up two years ago ? Yeah . Two years ago . Two years and too late . It 's started already , hasn 't it ? Rustling away down there , growing in the dark . Hello , Mr Tumour . Goodbye , daylight . Am I right ? Is he right , Colonel Hart ? Yes , sir . He 's right . Course I 'm right . Two years , and then it 's , " Night-night , Colonel Cancer , sir ! " Stop it ! Stop that ! Don 't you dare do that ! Uh-oh , it 's the missus . - Leave him alone . - Why ? Because my husband is better than that . Your husband is gone , Mrs Jackman . Erased , boiled away and never ever coming back . Do you get it , Mrs Jackman ? He 's dead , Mrs Jackman . Any questions Mrs Jackman ? Yes , one . The Appleyard ? OK . OK . Good question . The Appleyard , room 702 . Now , you see , she 's smart . She 's the one . You girls ... you big Marys with your guns , you haven 't got a clue . - She 's the one who 's dangerous . - Well ? The Appleyard ? The answer is , I don 't know . You weren 't there . That was our wedding night , you didn 't even exist then . - I don 't know . - You don 't have Tom 's memories . So how can you know about the Appleyard ? I don 't know ! Excuse me . I 'm getting it . You throw the bread in the water and the ducks - dah , dah - eat the bread . - That 's the basics , yes . - Mr Hyde ? - Mr Hyde , are you all right ? - I like feeding ducks . Is this your usual second date ? I just thought it 'd be nice to talk . This time . You don 't have to actually throw the bread at the ducks . I 'm getting their attention . It 's quicker . Erm ... Mr Hyde ? Mr Hyde ... Mr Hyde ? You were in a park . You were feeding ducks . What ? Excuse me , could we have the bill , please ? Just getting it ready . Don 't want the date part crowding out the sex . Stop ! Stop ! - Where are you now ? - In a restaurant . You ordered the bill . You said ... Too fast , too much , too fast , stop it , stop it ! Good boy . Shh . Good boy . Good boy . - How 's yours doing ? - Almost gone . - Can we swap ? - I put the work in . Stop ! Stop ! - What 's wrong , what 's happening ? - Stop ! They did . They stopped . What are you seeing right now ? We can 't help you unless you tell us . In a kitchen . Their kitchen . I 've got rewind . Look at that ! I 've got digital rewind . It 's like Sky Plus in here ! Can you explain to us what it is you 're experiencing ? What 's happening to you ? It 's his memories . It 's like I 'm downloading his memories . Big chunks . - Like it 's happening . - Tom 's memories . Hence the Appleyard . Does that mean he 's still in there ? Tom 's still in there somewhere . He 's alive . No . That means he 's dead . The brain is reallocating the memory space . You 've killed him , Peter . No , not killed technically . More like deleted . Deleted ? Be careful if I were you . OK . Careful , careful . You OK ? Three months married and I 'm competing with the TV . I like this film . Is there nudity ? - No . - OK , then . I 'm back in the game . - Now we 're talking . - What are you seeing now ? - I 've finally found the adult channels . - What does that mean ? You know the way you sometimes think men are mentally undressing you ? Peanuts ! She switched channels . It is not a tale , it is a trap . Typical woman , it 's a costume drama . The secret of this potion , you are certain it is known to you alone ? - Yes . - You are wrong . It is known to one other . Who ? Me . What are you seeing ? What are you seeing now ? Tell us what you see . It 's like Victorian times . And Daddy 's here . No , not Daddy . Granddad . No , Great-Granddad . Great-Great ... whatever . Dr Jekyll . The original . Doesn 't look like Spencer Tracy . How can he remember Dr Jekyll ? He was never there . - Race memory ? - Race memory doesn 't work like that . Well , for us it doesn 't . Maybe he 's got something better . I only want to know that I 'm right . One never quite knows who 's listening . The secret of Dr Jekyll 's potion . " Jeekle " ? - " Dr Jeekle " ? - What 's he saying ? It 's the original pronunciation . Dear God , he can 't actually be there , can he ? Nothing will appear in my account . You can trust me . You will tell no one ? It dies with you , Dr Jekyll 's last secret . It is not a tale , it is a trap . What ? Tell us , what ? How long have you been looking for Dr Jekyll 's potion ? Cost you a bit has it ? - Burnt a hole in the pocket ? - At the beginning . - And you used Jekyll 's notes ? - His notes , yes . And what happened when anyone drank it ? They died . He sent you on a wild goose chase . With a bit of murder on the side . Alice ? - Were you listening ? - What do you hope to achieve ? Your protection . With a tale of a magic potion ? Do you think anyone will think that 's the truth ? The truth is just a tale told often enough . The truth is me , sir . And we both know it . I raise the devil in you , not any potion . My touch , my love . Me . What ? - What ? ! - It 's you . You then and you now . You are here and you are there . What do you mean ? Where am I ? With him . Back then with Dr Jekyll . You 're with Dr Jekyll . You . It 's all about ... you . Alice . Oh , Alice . You 're the one thing that keeps me here . Without you , I 'm just him . Well , do you see ? The one thing that keeps him here , keeps him here and keeps you weak . Look at her . You will always be weak with her in the world . She 's still alive ! But what if she wasn 't ? Imagine . Oh , imagine . You could be free . She keeps you weak . Only her . You know what you need . Claire ! You all right , Mrs Jackman ? - What time is it ? - Half past three . - In the morning . - We know . I 've already had 15 separate food cravings . - She drew pictures of the last three . - Well , it passed the time , didn 't it ? Four women locked in a room without a single magazine . It 's like some kind of vile experiment . Can I see that ? Oh , anything in particular ? You 've got photographs of Dr Jekyll . What about the people around him ? His friends , you know , people he knew ? No , not really . Um ... members of his household , his servants . Who 's she ? - What 's happened to her face ? - Oh , the maid . That 's interesting , isn 't it ? It 's the same thing on this one . The damage is on the original photograph , done at the time , I think . Like someone was trying to conceal her identity . Why ? Dr Gilligan , get you anything from the canteen ? No . Oh , yeah , yeah , something chocolatey . OK . Oh ... Dr Gilligan ... Necketty neck-neck . Syme . Hello , this is Syme , who is this ? The next stage of human evolution . How much do you get for that these days ? Mr Hyde ? Where 's Dr Gilligan ? Dunno . Probably down the boozer with his mates , having a laugh . Mr Hyde , that lab is secure . You are in the centre of a secure area . There 's no way you can leave ... If I want to leave , you can 't stop me . But you know what ? That 's not what I want . Then tell us what you want , Mr Hyde . Who are you ? What do you want ? I want her . I want Claire . Do you know what I 'm thinking ? God forbid you should ever have an unexpressed thought . I 'm thinking about the wastepaper bin . - Sorry ? - You 'd all need to turn your backs . - Oh , for God 's sake ! - I 'm a pregnant woman ! And you 're getting nowhere with that lock . Thumb print-activated . I 'm sure this is a print scanner . You used to be so good with locks , didn 't you , dear ? Technology 's running away with me . Just no fun being locked up any more . Like you ever listen when I say that . So why you ? - I 'm sorry ? - My husband gave you a job . Why you ? I 'm qualified . I 'm a fully-qualified psychiatric nurse . Does that come with a uniform ? He 's never had any interest in me other than professional . And I certainly have no interest in him . Really ? Not my type . Very much not my type . Oh , come on . Is that actually likely ? I mean , just between you and me , just us girls together , all good taste and decency aside . He spends half his time as a world-class hottie . Yeah , well he spends the other half as Mr Hyde ! Oh , you meant the other ... the other way round . See what I did there ? You have good taste . Mrs Jackman . - Your husband wants to see you . - He 's up ? What 's he wanting ? - Bacon and eggs ? - I 'll take you to him . - What does he want ? - I 'll take you . Are my children here ? I need to see them . They 're being looked after . We should go . What 's going to happen to her ? Mrs Jackman , when you 're talking to Mr Hyde , keep watching the lights . If Dr Jackman 's there then the lights will flicker . It happens when he fights to get out . Like he needs to draw on the energy . If he 's in there and he 's fighting , the lights will flicker . You 're very observant . He 's strong , and if there 's any way for him to come back , he 'll come back for you . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . OK , let 's go . So what about us ? Yes , because quite honestly ... desperate for a pee . We 're taking you home . Oh , there 's no need , we brought the car . Just point us towards the door . - We 're taking you home . - No need . No problem . Oh , my God . Mrs Jackman . Hi , honey , I 'm home . Ooh , you 're scared . Love that . And just a little bit excited . A teensy-weensy bit . Or is that me ? Well ? On their way . Moment alone with the wife , boys . Oh , nice and private . What , am I getting lucky or something ? No , you 're not getting lucky . Messing with my head now , Mr Big Scary Man ? - I 'm so afraid . - Know how they killed your husband ? - They put him in a box . - Yeah . They put him in a box . Couldn 't figure it out at first . Didn 't make any sense . They didn 't give him any drugs , I 'd have felt that . Just one big shot of adrenalin , that 's all . But you know what ? They didn 't have to give him drugs . He was claustrophobic . All they needed . His biggest nightmare come true . Buried alive in a big steel box . Wired up to keep him fully alert . Completely aware of every passing second . Can you imagine ? Afraid of the dark , with your eyes pinned open . Wouldn 't you just die ? That 's how they killed him . They drove him mad , Mrs Jackman . They drove him out of my head . They put him in a box . How do you know he went mad ? Because I 'm here and he 's not . No , no , no , no , no , no , the lights won 't flicker this time . There 's not enough power in this place to put Humpty together again . He 's down a deep dark hole and he 's never coming out . Tom . Tom , if you 're in there , I need you . I need you now . Can 't hear you , love . But you know , you 're right . There 's always a chance . Let 's be sure . Let 's give him a memory he could never live with . Tom , I know you 're still in there . You 're my husband and you would never hurt me . And I know you 're still in there . All gone , love . Hubby 's all gone to dust . Tom , you wouldn 't do this . You 'd stop it ! You 're going to fight ! I was worried you wouldn 't . - I 'm going to scratch your eyes out ! - Ooh , goodie , try . I 'd like that . He 's not coming back . Any minute now , he won 't even want to . He 'll come back , you hear me ? Knock yourself out . Killing me will not be enough . Oh , sweetheart . Not nearly enough . Mummy ? - Mummy ? - Hello boys , it 's Uncle Billy . - What are you doing ? - We 're playing . It 's play time ! You will not touch my children ! I swear I will kill you if you touch my children ! Syme ! I want ten minutes . Ten minutes 'play time . - You will not touch my children ! - Make it 20 . I swear you will not get out of here alive ! I swear it ! Oh , what the hell . Give me half an hour . I know you can hear me . You have half an hour . Gee , thanks , Mom , you 're the best . He 's a child . Give him what he wants and he 'll be ours . Peter ? Are you there ? Peter , if you can hear this , you can 't let this happen . Peter , please . They 're your godchildren . - Turn it off . - Peter ! - For Christ 's sake , turn it off ! - You can 't let this happen ! Peter ! They 've turned off the cameras . All of them . No one can see or hear us . Suckers . We 've got half an hour to get out . Come on , let 's get those kiddies home . We can get out through the floor , into the next room , which gets us into the corridor . Hang on ... Yes , next room , corridor , no worries . He 's got a good memory , your husband . Comes in very handy . You 're not going to hurt us , then ? - Oh , take a joke , can 't you ? - A joke ? You said you 'd kill us . And they turned off the cameras . Let 's go home , honey . - I 'm to trust you ? - You 're safe with me . You 're a psychopath and I am not safe ! I 'm a psychopath with super powers and you 're my girl . - You 're not my husband . - It 's you keeps saying it . - Changed my mind . - Know the feeling . - You are not Tom . - Tell you what I am . I 'm strong . I don 't care how strong you are . I 'm so strong , I walk through this funny little world of yours and I don 't notice it . It bores me . But you ... you , Mrs Jackman ... You make me weak . I notice you . You 've never been safer in your life . Let 's go . Boys . Am I your father ? Give me your hands . It 's all right , give me your hands . Look closer . You know me . You always know me . Am I your father ? - Okey-dokey , you first . - Why me ? Fantastic arse . Er ... as you 're going to be taking us home , wouldn 't asking our addresses be an idea ? Hang on . Mr Syme ? No one 's in the life support casket now , are they ? I 'm getting readings . Jesus Christ ! Get out the way ! Get those cameras back on ! Inspection hatch . They 've got out through the power room . There 'll be a lock-down on the ground floor . - So where are we going ? - The roof . - Then what ? - One thing at a time ? - Do you share Tom 's finger prints ? - No . That 's a thumb print scanner . - No one gets in unless they 're allowed . - Trust me . Get the bloody thing open ! Oh ! Oh , my God ! What did he do to you ? He cut off my thumb ! Ah ... Let 's get out . Send the lift down , they 'll be tracking us . We 'll take the stairs the rest of the way . It 's only two floors . The wife 's making a bit of a fuss , so put this in a fridge somewhere . It 's for Dr Gilligan . - What is it ? - He 'll recognise it . - Who are you ? - Oh , that 's a point . Better kill you . - You 're killing him ! - Trust me , I 'm a psychopath ! - Don 't ! - But I 've started . You 're not going to kill anyone . No more killing people , got it ? Every day without killing someone ? What kind of life is that ? It 's called marriage , honey . - Well , what are we gonna do with him ? - Tie him up . That takes ages . There . He 'll be out for 20 minutes . No , sod it , we 'll take the full hour . It 's OK . Don 't look . Ssh . - There 's a helipad on the roof . - And ? Helipad , yeah . OK . Question . Quite a big question , if I 'm honest . - Can I fly a helicopter ? - That 's the plan ? " Can I fly a helicopter ? " That 's the plan ? ! Wait . He had a lesson . Yeah , he did . He had a lesson . I 've got him sitting in a helicopter . - No , it 's a moped . No , a helicopter . - Oh , Jesus Christ ! Actually , it could have been a horse . Hm , his attention really wandered , didn 't it ? Mr Hyde these weapons are aimed at your wife and your children . If you hesitate in any way to comply with my instructions , we will first kill the child on your left . Signal your understanding , but do not speak . You have a gun in your left hand . You will drop it . No play-acting , Mr Hyde , I know how much they mean to you . My camera was never switched off . She makes you weak . Not that weak . This organisation has waited over 100 years for you . There is nothing you can accomplish with that gun that will change a thing . I will count to five and you will drop it . - One , two ... - Never gonna make it to five . Then neither will your children . Three ... Let my family go , or I 'll blow my brains out . You 've waited over 100 years . Don 't miss out now , let them go . No . Kill yourself . It 's a good plan , I never thought of that . Kill yourself . If you 're dead , we have no further use for your family . You can save them now . Just kill yourself . Blow your brains out . Can you do it ? Tom Jackman could do it , he loves them enough . Do you ? - Four ... - No . Don 't ! Five . Course not . Too afraid of dying , like all children . You are just a child , Mr Hyde . We took the man in you away . As we 're up here , I 'll take the helicopter now . And I 'll take the Jackmans with me . Where are you taking them ? Where you will follow . We have your family and you have no choice . You will come to us . Welcome to the company , Mr Hyde . Ah . I was hoping for a longer journey . All three of you , go and stand in the beam of the headlights , right in the middle . - This is murder . - No . No , we 're just taking a break . You must have been a soldier once . What could possibly be worth all this ? The cure for cancer ? Oh , I see . You wanna live ? I know the feeling . I 'm supposed to be a superman . Why am I not a superman ? Daddy ! Daddy ! Why am I not a superman ? ! Why am I not a superman ? ! Why am I not a superman ? ! Daddy ! I 'm supposed to be dangerous . Why am I not a superman ? Are you listening to me , Daddy ? I 'm supposed to be Superman ! Half a man . For her . Yes , Mr Hyde , we all know about your little power-draining trick . But it won 't work this time . Tom Jackman 's gone . There isn 't enough power in this entire building to bring him back . Oh , my God ! My God ! Jesus , look at that ! What 's happening ? Sorry , ladies , not my decision . Oh , God ! What are we going to do ? Run ! After them ! This way . Mr Hyde ? Sorry . You 're not dealing with Junior anymore . Daddy 's home . I want you to send a message , to your boss . To those people who took my family . Three words : - We are coming . - " We " ? There is no " we " , Tom . You 're alone . - Alone against everyone . - Three words : We are coming . Send it . Sign it ... Jekyll ... and Hyde .

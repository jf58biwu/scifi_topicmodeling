I 've been monitoring the media for possible threats . arson at an Oakland dock forced the rerouting of a shipment of refined coltan into the port of Los Angeles . Coltan ? Skynet will use it as a key element in our endoskeletal alloy . That doesn 't mean Cromartie 's back . How can it be Cromartie ? Are you forgetting that I blew his head off ? I remember . That 's why I went to find this . You should watch . It won 't play . Put it on video 2 . Thanks for explaining . Where 'd you get this ? Check the paper tomorrow for any dead anchormen . I don 't sleep . There . He came through . He knows we 're here . It 's just a head . His chip is intact . We 're programmed to repair ourselves . We 're programmed to blend in . an arm . He 'll rebuild and continue his mission to hunt and kill . I know what his mission is . I still have the money from the safe house . - off the grid . - Go south ... What ? Thought you said we weren 't gonna run anymore . We were gonna fight . This is different . this is different . he 's vulnerable . - We know where he 'll be . - A new skin means a new face . - We won 't know what he looks like . - But we know where he 'll be .

Except some kind of blood that isn 't quite blood . It 's not natural . I like natural . Natural 's assuring . It helps me sleep at night . I meant more the FBI 's interest . You know the FBI . We 're interested in everything . So this guy ... comes in Friday night . A.M. That 's the only lead we have at the moment . I thought he looked familiar . He was a patient . We did his chin and nose last May . George Lazlo . We still have the charges . We can rig ' em at the door . Blow ' em when they try to drive out . Then Cameron can take out ... Get in the car . We 're going . What ? the plan was to hunt Cromartie . That 's not Cromartie . kick their asses and go for pancakes ? It doesn 't work like that . We 're outnumbered . - We have her . - We don 't know what 's going on . That thing has real estated his employees . Who knows how many more are in there . There 's three of us .

That 's how many . John ! John ! No ! they 'll find him . You wanna tell me what you 're doing here ? Have you seen a dachshund puppy ? They had army uniforms . The tags . Where would they go ? They 're going north . John 's phone . You can track it online . This actually works ? no . The signal is lost . - The phone might be damaged . - Come on . Damn it ! - Come on ! - Breaking the computer won 't help . Do you have any idea what 's going on ? I lost him . I lost John . I understand . It 's impossible for you to understand . your life has no purpose . I can 't believe I let him talk me into this . and it 's too soon . Is it ? The world ends in four years . What ? Left you a message . Davidson was buying at Houston 's . they sent me to check to see if you 'd died or something . Did you die ? You run across him on those pico murders ? Or John Doe 's bar code tats ? - No ... who is he ? - George Lazlo . Unemployed actor . Got him on video at the murder scene . Only suspect I got with his file is straight vanilla . Are you trying to impress the boss ? Crank out the Sugar Ray and call Monica Lewinksy . It 's 1999 again . - Sugar what ? - James ... forget about it . this case is a dog . And you 're not young . can I help you ? You got some guy holed up in room three ? That would be my dog . Lazlo ? He asked if he needed a lawyer . I told him it was just a courtesy thing . So what 's this all about ? It 's about my case . Good case ? We 'll find out soon enough . He strike you as a killer ? Everyone strikes me as a killer . So ... George ... you 're an actor . Been in anything I 've seen ? What is this about ? Just some questions related to Dr. Lyman 's death . So ... anything ? I see a lot of movies . It 's been slow . I 'll tell you that . I got six dead bodies and a mystery man who might be trying to change his identity . So is that why you got the work ? Chin and nose . Did you kill the doctor to cover your tracks ? Dolores . Meet Mr. Lazlo . I was hoping that he would give us a little blood sample . tops . Make a fist . Great . Just a little sting . Can 't seem to find a vein . you know that ? - Are you kidding me ? - No . Tell me where they went . go to hell . or I 'm gonna beat you to death . And don 't call me lady . damn it ! he can 't tell us anything . I 'm not gonna tell you anything . Okay . like you got the stones . You can go . If you can get past her . Mcguire Gunnery range ? This place is the size of L.A. County . Where exactly are they ? She 's talking to you . It 's depot 37 . It 's a decommissioned arms depot in the southeast corner . abandoned hangars . It was an air force base back in the cold war ... I don 't know what they 're doing . clean up when they left . The man just needed guys . That 's all I know . I swear to God . Just drive faster . please . Your tax dollars at work . you need more blood ? What the ... Put me down ! - Did you lock this ? - Yeah . Damn it . Damn it ! Guy must have popped it . He 's been bitchin ' about money all week . - Think he just split ? - You surprised ? - Guy threatened to bail twice a day . - Let 's just finish and get out of here . - Who tells Carter ? - You ... he 's your friend . Friend ? He 's just a guy I met . Six victims . different lives . What 's the connection ? Greta was saying none . Guys in the house were drug dealers . But there 's some blood matches . And ... we got George here . George Lazlo . is this guy ? Jim ... - James ... not Jim . James . apologies . I just wanna make sure you 're aware Lazlo was cleared . Blood sample came back . Not a match to the plastic surgeon 's office . We got blood ? - How 'd we manage that ? - I ... I finessed the samples . I heard it didn 't match . I 've been thinking of another possibility . Whoever killed Dr. Lyman was in there for two days . I 'm thinking there 's a chance ... our killer had himself cut to look like Lazlo ... then killed him . Wouldn 't there be scars and bruising ? The office has a hyperbaric oxygen system ... which speeds healing . And he could have used makeup . I considered this too . I asked the office manager . Apparently they keep detailed records of the anesthesia . the levels were unchanged . No one had surgery . No one had anesthesia . There 's a possibility they just didn 't use any . I asked that too . the eyes ... You can 't take that kind of pain . It 's impossible . for the blood ? Last thing we need 's a lawsuit . So ... if t isn 't anything else ... Jim . Facts are facts . Sorry about that . it just doesn 't add up . Doesn 't add up it 's ' cause we don 't have all the numbers yet . nobody expects anything from you on this . Your ass is suitably covered . Why you wanna rock the boat ? three people blew themselves up in a bank . Greta . I just ... I just feel it . maybe you should try feeling a little less . 'Cause you 're going blind . You can 't just leave me here . hurry up . Would have been faster to kill him . you seem inefficient . I 'm not for you to understand . You said that before . you know ? inefficient things . Humans ... get used to it . I told the guy to just be patient . - Looks like he bailed . - So he 's gone then ? it doesn 't surprise me . Was bitching about the money all week . Then I wanna thank you for your service . This is it ? This is depot 37 ? Did that guy lie to you ? No ... This is it . - This is where the factory will be . - What factory ? Where I 'll be made . Me and many others . Right there . It 's inside . Coltan is rare in the future . Much of it was destroyed when the bombs went off . He 's stockpiling it for after judgment day . where it 'll be safe . Your gun . Give it to me now . I don 't have a gun ... or anything . I didn 't shoot anyone . Carter ! all right ? What 's your name ? - My name 's John . - What the hell are you doing here ? man . In the wrong place at the wrong time . - What 's your name ? - Mike . we got a problem . Okay ? he 's a ... he 's a really bad guy . All right ? He killed those guys . And he 'll kill us if he finds us . - So we need to get out ... - Carter ? He shot them ? right ? Have you noticed that something 's just off about him ? Like he 'd just kill you just because . So there 's something wrong with him . You know ? Yeah . - Where is he ? - Don 't ! This bastard owes me my money ! I 'll take my share and theirs too . Hey ! Freak ! I 'm talkin ' to you ! just open the door . Thank you for your service . What are you ? please . It 's not your fault . Maybe it 's yours . maybe he wouldn 't have gone off the reservation . - John does these things . - Not the John I know . The john I know . thank god . - Mom ? - Mom . - We 're right outside . You all right ? Yeah . he 's blocking the door . It 's like he 's frozen . He 's frozen ? it 's like he went to sleep or something . Standby . He completed his mission . He powered down to standby mode until he 's moved or triggered awake . Triggered ? The door . They put him into standby . 15 seconds . The reboot time . listen to me . This is what I want you to do . I want you to open that door . And run . you run . John ? I run . So what do you think future john would do right now ? We 'll see . John . Come on ! - I thought you said you could drive . - It 's jammed or something . Step on the clutch . Hard ! you gotta learn how to drive a stick . - Let 's go . - But can he get out ? Drive . Mr. Lazlo . May I come in ? Thank you . Pepperoni ? I love those things . My bosses told me i should stay clear of you . For legal reasons . I understand . But I thought I owed it to you to drop by . - Give you a warning . - A warning ? there 's a chance- - but a chance ... that there 's someone out there who might be trying to steal your identity . Steal my identity ? What for ? What do people do with anything these days ? and intimidate others . Damage the national psyche . Anyway ... anytime . Thank you for your help . Sure . Have a nice day . Have a nice day . Not every version of the Golem story ends badly . destroying all those that seek to harm its maker . the Golem 's maker destroys his creature before it destroys the world . You okay ? I 'm fine . Really . How many times we gonna have this talk ? I think . I should go finish my homework . we can control . it is in the nature of us to make our own monsters . built from our own imperfect flesh . We animate them with magic . And never truly know what they will do .

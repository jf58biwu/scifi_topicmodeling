 It all began in the fire . The primeval fire . The fire of hell . Like in the maw of the dragon . Like in a fairy tale . If we learn anything from fairy tales , it 's not that dragons exist , but that they can be beaten . As in a fairy tale , I 'll begin with " Once upon a time ... " Once upon a time , there was a remote little station in the depths of space , orbiting a hell by the name of ... Dante . If anyone cares , someday , to delve into our story , they 'll probably say it began with the arrival of liaison shuttle number 2 . In fact , it had all been written long before . A very long time before . Since the dawn of time , perhaps . Dante 01 Psychiatric Detention Centre Doctors 2 , Patients 7 , Security Guards 3 Welcome to Dante 01 . I hope you had a pleasant awakening . I 'll be waiting for you . – My name is ... – Charon , the station chief . Being so well informed , you 'll easily find the control centre . FIRST CIRCLE Hello . So this is the famous " nut ship " ? Is that company slang ? In fact , they 're ... Criminals and mental cases . Volunteers to test our treatments . I 've studied all their files . Who can claim to know men 's minds ? Goes with the job ! Have you met ? Who wouldn 't know our mentor ? Your work on criminal psychobiology is a reference at Neurinos . I 'm Elisa . What did you do to deserve a trip to this antechamber of hell ? I 've come to try out some new treatments on the prisoners . I 'll explain the rules of our little world ... The detention quarters are in the levels just below us . Look ... The new arrival . Time for him to meet his playmates . They 're tagged for permanent tracking . Dear old Rasputin is taking things in hand . Look . That 's Rasputin . God has answered my prayers ! God never abandons his children ! Stop raving for a minute ! This man has come to save us . No one can save you , Rasputin . Saint George the Dragon Slayer can ! There are no dragons here . Anyway , who told you his name ? God did . Look ! O ye of little faith ! God ? Wasn 't it someone upstairs ? Have you changed your name to Judas ? I serve God , not men . You 'd better . If you got it into your head to betray us , you 'd meet your God a lot earlier ! What 's your name ? Not very chatty . All the better . We 've too many prattlers as it is . His name is Saint George ! Once you set your mind on something ... Saint George it is , then ! Attila , did you get the data I asked for ? I 'm working at it , sweetie . Keep your hair on . That will do ! Remember you 're only a prisoner . Stop playing the big chief , Charon . I could withdraw your access to the network . You wouldn 't do that . You need me . And if they found out up there , you 'd be demoted . I want to know why that shuttle came . Look through Elisa 's files . And watch the new arrival ! Gentlemen ... Our new arrival ! The elegant eater is Moloch . Moloch ! The other one is Lazarus . What 's his name ? I haven 't heard him speak yet . I 'll explain the rules of our little world . As long as you abide by them , we 'll leave you alone . Do you understand ? Does he hear what I 'm saying ? Do you hear me ? We listen in on what they say to the Answerer . Strange name . That 's what they call it . No screen to watch them at the same time ? I don 't need to remind you how confined this space is . We 're sensitive to every squeak or whisper . With video surveillance too , they wouldn 't say as much . The Answerer is their only " free space " . I just wanted to help them . I saw that they wanted to leave this life . I just wanted to help them ... They call him Buddha . Lots of victims . He says he killed them out of compassion . He still has attacks but nothing like his original fits of rage . He often just lies there asleep . " Meditating " , as he says . Hey , Buddha ! Want to see the new boy ? Answer me ! We don 't know very much about your shuttle companion . He was found covered in blood on a drifting long-haul ship . Alone on board . Any ID ? Nothing . The black boxes were scorched . Why bring him here ? Neurinos thought the new treatments should be tested in space . What new treatments ? We 'll talk about them later . You see ? Look at me . This is your card . It gets you three meals a day . Don 't lose it . Watch out for Moloch . Three meals aren 't enough for him . He 'll try to nick your card . Hey , sweetie ? Three meals a day aren 't enough . Not enough ! That 's enough ! Do you want them to gas us ? Sit down . Never lose sight of them . That 's nothing . Par for the course . When Cæsar intervenes , they calm down quickly . Did you put him in charge ? No . The prisoners won 't let us impose anything . They organise themselves . We just watch that they don 't kill each other . Sometimes we intervene too late , unfortunately . Maybe if you applied the protocols more strictly ... There 's more to life than protocols ! I 've been looking for you . So you 're the new one ? What 's your name ? I 'm Buddha . And you ? Not going to answer ? You 're in pain , eh ? You know ... I can deliver you from your pain . I can help you to the other side . Where there 's no pain . I just want to help you . It 's the same every time , Buddha ! Any new arrival , you try to strangle him ! I just wanted to help him . Don 't talk rubbish ! You get off on killing , not helping ! You don 't decide who dies , is that clear ? It 's clear . Is that clear ? It 's clear , it 's clear ! It 's clear , Cæsar . Catch him ! What is it now ? Buddha tried to strangle the new one . They 're going to sort him out . – We 'll go in . – How ? The anæsthetising gas first . Wait five minutes . That gives us an hour . We can treat Buddha . That never does any good . Any better suggestions ? We could test my new protocols . What are they exactly ? Nanotechnology . Intelligent programs to neutralise chromosomal dysfunctions . A DNA patch to solve the mystery of the human psyche , eh ? Ah ! Liberation through the power of words ! Is that yourtherapy ? Which do you prefer ? Risky new procedures or tried and trusted techniques ? Neither . We 're after efficient and commercial solutions . This isn 't the time . We 'll try your new treatment . Without me , then . Cer and Berus ... They 're asleep . You can go in . What if they woke up ? Couldn 't happen . They 'd have to hold their breath for ten minutes . It 's funny . I 've never been in here without Persephone before . More anæsthetic ? He could be a handful . No , those straps are strong . Fine . Berus , knock him out ! Wait , he 's calming down . Wait for it to take effect . You can take him back . Was it you ? Was it you who saved me ? Why ? I don 't know what they did , but before you got to me I felt like my blood was on fire . Who are you ? Why do you never speak ? Never mind . You will when you 're ready . Now I 'll look after you . Come on . How did the experiment go ? As if you didn 't know ! I saw Buddha reacting very violently to your treatment . A normal defence reaction . The program adds corrective sequences to the DNA . And the added sequences don 't conflict with the existing sequences ? That 's the risk . We can 't yet predict how the guinea-pigs will react . " Guinea-pigs " ? Those headcases signed a contract with Neurinos . They 're the worst kind of criminal , only left alive if they 'll be guinea-pigs . Why does the word shock you ? As an expert in human , even criminal , behaviour , I 'm against using the word " guinea-pig " . Fuck ! Let 's see what you 've got . What 's that ? Fuck ! Permitted losses : 100 % It is said that on the gates of hell is written : " Abandon hope , all ye who enter here . " Yet it is here , in the midst of these pariahs , these reprobates , that the true sense of my quest became clear . I , Persephone , having devoted my life to curing minds , saw , in the body of a patient , the birth of a possible salvation ... The force that emanates from Saint George is beyond us . I do not understand it yet , but I know that no one on this station shall be spared . Second Circle – Am I disturbing you ? – A bit . I wanted to check you were OK . You don 't need anything ? I 'm fine , thanks . By the way ... What do you think of Persephone ? Just like I imagined . Meaning ? She 's been here too long . She lacks objectivity . Yes , perhaps . Neurinos doesn 't trust her . When will you be leaving ? When I have enough significant data . Why ? Does my presence bother you ? No . Quite the contrary . Goodbye . Charon sweetie , are you there ? I managed to get into the shuttle 's computer . Trouble is , the files are very well protected . Restricted to Neurinos staff only . So ? Surely you can bypass that . Yeah , probably . But to do so , I 'll need your password . Don 't you have it ? You do disappoint me . I 'd have to be a genius to manage with the gear you 've given me . Let 's see what kind of a genius you are . You never keep your promises , Buddha . Do you understand why I can 't trust you ? I know I never kept my word . But I know that won 't happen again . It 's too late . No one here wants to die because you can 't control yourself . That was before . Before what ? Before he cured me . Him ? He cured you ? You 're insane ! I told you , Cæsar . He 's an angel sent by God . Cured or not , I don 't want you starting again . Deal with him . – Keep out of this ! – Buddha 's cured ! Get out of my way ! Moloch ? Chief ! He 's not wounded , he 's breathing ! It 's incredible ! Shall I take a blood sample ? He was in his death throes . Now look at his heartbeat . If that 's not a miracle ... Ridiculous ! It was just a superficial wound . Moloch 's wound disappeared through the new one 's intervention . There must be a rational explanation for his recovery . I can 't kill someone who saved my life . What do you say , Lazarus ? You ask me to waste him , I will . I couldn 't care less about him . Maybe you weren 't so badly injured . This Saint George is causing trouble among us . The others think he 's the Messiah . You understand , Moloch ? If we don 't do something , they 'll get rid of us . What is it ? It 's since the last shakedown . If we don 't stop him , we won 't have long left . They 'll make him chief . They 'll strangle us in our sleep . For revenge ! They won 't spare us . If he can cure people , he can also kill them . Kill him nice and quietly . Moloch ! Here ... No one will bother you here . I 'll fetch you a blanket . That 's it . I 'll keep watch . What is it ? I 've never seen you off your food . I don 't know ... I feel a bit peaky . Enough time wasting ! We 've got work to do . A present from Cæsar . – Where 's Persephone ? – Listening room , I think . She likes wasting her time . I don 't like seeing those two together . Who 's there ? Is that you , Buddha ? The Answerer is busy . That 's OK . We 'll wait our turn . Why can 't we see them ? They 're in the blind spot . That 's not a good sign . The light ... Stop it ! This scumbag tried to kill you . Cæsar didn 't want him dead . You should gas them , boss . Look at this shit ! Can your messiah save you now ? What 's got into you , Moloch ? Let go ! Third Circle I 'm sure I saw him dying . At least ten fatal blows . He 'd lost almost all his blood . This time you can 't deny that it was a resurrection . Resurrection or not , I must try new treatments on this man . And I 'm determined to do so . How do you explain his miraculous cures ? Their " miraculous " nature is not proven . You knew , didn 't you ? – What ? – That he 's no ordinary man . He wouldn 't be here if he was . Stop acting dumb ! The company sent him here to isolate him . He 's exhibiting exceptional characteristics . What 's it to you ? You 're not concerned by this affair . What will you do with him ? Dissect him ? To get to the bottom of the mystery . You can always resign . I 'm in charge of psycho-genetics here , and I forbid any manipulation of this man . I have an official letter countermanding your authority . Stuff your letter ! What do you say , Charon ? We 've discussed this . You know what to do . I 'm relieving you of your functions . This is official . Do you realise what 's at stake here ? Not just you or me . All of humanity ! Oh , humanity ... They 'll commercialise his genetic codes and then eliminate him . We must keep him alive , understand what he is . We have to stop her changing his metabolism . Charon ... Sorry , Persephone . I can 't . Neurinos has given her authority over you . They 'll leave when the shuttle 's ready . It was all planned in advance . Get out . I 'm doing it for your good . " How sad a path it is to climb and descend another 's stairs . " What does that mean ? You never saw this coming ! Don 't be too hard on Persephone . I don 't understand . She cares more about the prisoners than the results . The straps ! Let her go ! Let her go ! Charon , do something ! Be reasonable . I 'll let you join the others . Let her go ! An emergency . Let 's go ! I 've opened the airlock . Let her go now . – What else could I do ? – Make sure the straps are tight ! You told me he was dead . We don 't usually restrain corpses ! Hi , sweetie . There you are . Just to tell you we 'll soon be crashing into Dante and burning up in hell , like the damned that we are ! That 's nonsense . I know what you 're playing at , Charon . I cracked your files a long time ago . Your Elisa and her nanotechnology were really going to fuck us up ! We were all going to be contaminated from the inside , infected like a common computer program . You know what to do with epidemics ? Burn everything ! I used your password to lock everything down . This is my apocalypse ! Cæsar ! Can anyone up there hear me ? Cæsar ... What the fuck are they doing ? Moloch . Lazarus . You told me he was dead . Get away ! What have you done to me ? A light ... I saw a light . What are you talking about ? – We need a way out . – There is one . You have to pilot manually . The light ... Where was it coming from ... this light ? I don 't know ... That alarm means we 're all going to die ! Calm down , Lazarus . Keep cool . – You can 't order me ! – I 'm not . I 'm advising you . Things have changed here . Changed ? You can say that again . What ? You have to keep playing the chief , eh , Cæsar ? – That alarm ? – That was me . I set it off . You 'd need the gear . I got it off the chief up there . To snoop in company files . – He thought he controlled me . – Get to the point ! The point ? There 's no hurry , Cæsar . We 've less than an hour to live . After that : boom ! Listen . I deprogrammed the station . It 'll crash . You 're insane ! Like all of us . We 're scum , aren 't we ? They mustn 't erase our memories . They were going to defragment us in the void ! I didn 't realise you were this unhinged . We 're all going to fry ! And you , Dragon Slayer ... You won 't be able to resurrect us ! I 'm dead . Dead , you hear me ? Since I came to this station I 've been dead . Catch him ! Why not the shuttle I came in ? It 's only for two . We have to reach the piloting cabin . In under an hour ! There 's supposed to be a trapdoor . If we get there , we could reboot the system . It 's in the prisoners ' area . Yes . Found him ? That way . Go on , pull . Maybe he was just trying to scare us . Giving Attila a computer ? Like giving matches to a pyromaniac ! They knew up there . How reckless can you get ? It 's time to join those I sent to the other side . I no longer fear death . Wait ! There 's only one justice . God 's justice . Look ... – We 're still alive . – Fucking bullshit ! We 're crashing into that fucking planet and you 're talking about God ? In a few minutes we 'll all be dead ! Do you understand ? Dead ! Trust in God . Fuck God ! If we 're his creatures , he needn 't have bothered ! And what about his miracles ? Gentlemen . Our station has left its geostationary orbit . We must reach a control panel under your quarters , and activate the emergency boosters . I ask you , therefore , to cooperate with us . If you approve , raise your hands . She isn 't coming , then . Aren 't you afraid ? Afraid ? We should have opened the door ages ago . And never closed it again . I 'm Charon , the director of this station . He 's the fucking maniac who gave the gear to Attila ! He 's the one ! That 's enough ! Shut it ! We 're here to help . The panel is only accessible via the cooling conduits . Go on . The trapdoor is in this part . Over there , I think . Gas ! Quiet ! Going to do a runner , eh ? I never thought I 'd see a babe like you again . – You 're not ... – No , I 'm not asleep . I can hold my breath . – You 're hurting ! – You can 't give me orders now . Where were you going ? The shuttle can get us to safety . Us ? It 's meant for two . You knocked everyone out for that . You 're a crafty one , eh ? Like me . A two-year journey , then you 're free . Two years ? In there with you ? That 's worth a try , eh ? But I 'm warning you . No funny business ! Go on . After you , princess . Wake up . – Who released the gas ? – Who do you think ? Berus , go and check the shuttle ! Quick ! Cer , the trapdoor ! It 's the only way . At least four metres . It 's far too long . The cooling system is overheating . They were in the shuttle . Attila must have fixed the controls . It burnt up . We 'll soon be joining them . What 's down there ? The piloting cabin . We can break away from Dante 's pull . – Is it complicated ? – Really simple . You just enter a code . You 'll never get down there . It 's far too narrow . We need someone of my build . What 's the code ? Etna D10 . Have you thought this through ? My brain 's not boiled yet ! Cæsar 's sacrifice was probably not an innocent one . For , if we aspire to the light , each of us has a duty to drive away the shadows . We never knew who he was , nor where he came from . Yet one thing is certain . It was from us that Saint George drew the force to slay the dragon . His destiny could only be fulfilled here , at the gates of hell , at this threshold never before crossed by a living man .

 Stop ! I have no intention of accepting his invitation . Well , you should . - No , really ... - He is charming . It would do you good to go out once in a while . Listen , Manon , it 's too soon . You know ... besides , I 'm not in the mood for this . I understand , but it 's just that you should focus on yourself a bit . You don 't have to commit to anything , it 's just dinner . You know I have my work , that 's enough for me . It 's just dinner , Mom . Dinner , sure . You know where that leads . He 's good looking . No ? Yes , he is . Stop it , you 're terrible . Mom . It would get you out of your clinic . We 'll see . Look , I am big enough to know when I can get out of my clinic . Don 't rush me . - Okay ? - Fine . So stop it . Leave me alone . - What about you ? - You never go out . I love you . Stay here , don 't move . He 's disappeared . Open the door or I 'll kill her . It hurts , right ? You 're not answering your phone so I thought I would come by . Are you all right ? Hanging in there ? What about your arm ? They found the body of a girl this morning . Barely 20 years old . She had those marks , like the other ones . It 's not over , David . The retinal scan was inconclusive . So was the anthropometry . She can 't be found on any file . If you want my opinion , she 's an illegal alien . Considering how stiff the body is and the condition of her body tissues , I think she has been dead for three weeks . No trace of sexual assault . But considering her condition ... I 'm kidding . What 's that ? Scratches . No idea . They look like little bear scratches . Baby bear . I 'm kidding . That could be caused by an eye retractor . Three little scratches on her superior eyelid . Four little scratches on her inferior eyelid . Were you able to identify the object ? No . With the water gnawing the flesh ... However , I found some brain damage . No trace that she was hit on her skull . A coma ? No , I would say that her brain suffered some sort of electroshocks . Powerful ones . As if someone had put her head in a microwave oven . I 'm kidding , Captain . It 's the first time he 's left a corpse behind . No , it 's not the first time . David , Sarah 's death has affected all of us . I need you to find Nicolov and put him behind bars . Ah , Marie . Lieutenant Marie Becker . She will be your partner for the rest of the investigation . Hello . I got the fingerprint results . We have nothing . Oh , yes . I forgot to tell you . I found some fingerprints . David . David , I am telling you she has no police file . Please . We 'll start with that . UNKNOWN IDENTITY Beautiful . You 're even more beautiful . Perfect calcification . You can barely see the scar . So , when are we getting married ? Hello , Jacques . Hello , Clara . Jacques is a true artist . You are magnificent . You can thank him . Thank you . Can I look ? Of course , go ahead . You see , it was worth it . I have to go , ladies . I have surgery in three hours and I have some driving to do . I 'll walk you out . They implanted the chip in me . It hurts . Welcome to my life . - It 's classy , though . - Classy ? Yes . I 've always wanted to work for the European police force ever since I decided to become a cop . So you can imagine when I found out I was hired ... I didn 't do anything special , actually . But I was happy . Before that , I spent three years in the vice brigade . What about you ? There 's a guy called Becker at Homeland Security . Yes , that 's my uncle . Right . Wait . I have been waiting for my transfer for two years . I had to pass the exam like everybody else . And you 're lucky , you got me as a partner . See , I told you there was no nepotism involved . What the hell are you doing here ? Is she the next one ? Wait ! That 's enough . It 's all right . Forget it . Where do we start ? We 're going to visit a friend . Hey , I 'm in here ! Shit ! Stay out of it . Someone told me you were back . Let me know when you haul your ass somewhere . You broke my nose . You 're hurting me , David . Stop . She 's an illegal alien . Do you know her ? Tatiana . Her name is Tatiana . Tatiana what ? I don 't know . All I know is she disappeared two months ago with her sister Helena . They both disappeared . That 's all I know . I swear . - Has he resurfaced ? - Who ? - Nicolov . - Nobody has seen him . He 's clever . He messes with scans . You 're gonna move your ass , Yuri . Inspect the whole area . I don 't give a shit how you do it . I give you three days . Do you hear me ? Three days . If you don 't find anything , I 'm sending you back home , quick . Wait , wait . Show me her face . I need to show you something . The old guy disappeared six months ago . We found him a few weeks ago . His brain was empty . They erased everything . Everything . In a country like yours , so vast , such a device is invaluably useful . Remote surgery offers many possibilities . We can be linked through a network and two teams located in different geographic locations can operate at the same time . The holographic image appears on the monolith . Excuse me . I 'm really sorry . What are you doing here ? What 's wrong ? Do you have a migraine ? I can give you a higher dose of painkillers . I want to go home . My darling ... it 's too soon . You have to rest . I 'm sick of this . I can 't take it anymore . The scans , the tests , all of that . I 'm suffocating . Don 't worry . Things will fall back into place . It 's just a question of time . Everything is confused in my head . It 's getting worse . I can 't remember anything . Even when I am with you I sometimes feel like you are a stranger . I can 't take it anymore . I don 't feel anything . You know , your dad would be very proud of you . Don 't worry , sweetheart . Don 't worry . Come here . Come here , darling . It 's going to be all right . You just need to be patient , that 's all . How is it going with Hoffman ? It 's going . He doesn 't talk much , but I talk for both of us . Don 't trust him . I don 't usually distrust ... Don 't trust him . Hi . It looks like it 's the right model . I checked on the amnesiac , it fits . Except ... it 's useless . It 's a standard model , all eye doctors have one . What 's that ? It 's from a search at Tatiana and Helena 's house . Is that your personal diary hidden underneath your pillow ? Can I read it ? You know , it could help with your treatment . I don 't have much left , Clara , so don 't touch it . When are you going to stop biting your fingers ? Did you know him ? I met him right before his death . Do you think I look more like my father or my mother ? All I know , is that you have your father 's eyes . Good evening . So how did it go this afternoon ? Rather well . Thank you , Clara . You can go . I 'm in no hurry , you know . We 'll be fine . Have a good evening . - Good night , Manon . - Good night . I 'm tired . Want to watch a movie with your mom ? Sure . Calling Christine to room 208 . - Christine . - Are you mad ? What are you doing here ? Come on , you have to go to bed . Hey , stop kissing me ! He 's coming . Did you see the bikes ? Ouch ! What are you doing ? You didn 't call me here to look at a bike . I swear , it 's his . He had it custom made by a guy who works here . He told me he was going to come pick it up tonight . Don 't bullshit me . With you , never , David . Beat it . Yuri ! Remember Helena . I want her alive . We 're supposed to trust him ? And I 'm supposed to trust you ? So , what else ? Are you married ? Do you have children ? You 're right . None of my business . You 're right . Let 's not talk about ourselves . I 'm not married , I don 't have any children . What about you ? Me ? Nothing . I 'm not married , I don 't have children and I don 't have a lover anymore . Of course , I have a cat . Wonderful . Don 't move . Stay here . Don 't move . Sure . ID # 1 25 614 asking for backup in the commercial zone . Raise your hands ! Come over here . Slowly . Stop ! Stop ! On your knees . On your knees . Shoot . Shoot ! David ! You 've got no balls . What are you doing here , Clémence ? I 'm bored . Bored ? - You want to go for a walk ? - I 'm not allowed to . Me neither . Sometimes I 'm bored , sometimes I 'm not . Sometimes I go crazy . What 's that ? That 's ... scars from my accident . You never told me you had an accident . Hey , girls . Come on , it 's time . I 'm going to kiss you a million times . Come on , Manon . Calling Professor Brügen to room ... Marie , you 'll be in charge of questioning . Thanks , David . You 're done . Is this a joke ? Go home now . I don 't want to talk about it . Come with me , Marie . Go ahead . You know just as well as I that he 's in good hands . Let me proceed with his custody . Just for looks . I have to go . I 'll keep you posted . - So ? - Nothing . He 's been talking nonsense for two hours . His fingerprints match the ones we found on Tatiana . That should be enough , right ? I thought this questioning would give you an opportunity to show us your talent . To know more about you . I have to say I am a little disappointed . Well , I 'll go back to it then . Are you crazy ? What 's going on in your head ? God damn it ! - Shut up ! - Stop it . Don 't move , bitch . Come here , whore . Stay right here . Open the door or I 'll kill her . Shut up , bitch ! Open the door or I 'll kill her . Don 't move , bitch . Open the door or I 'll kill her . Look at that , bitch . Did you see that , huh ? Look ! So what do you want ? You want me to kill her ? Don 't touch me . Who are you ? Who do you think you are ? All I wanted from the start was to switch guard duty with her . I 've been trying to take two weeks of vacation since September . You think that 's fair ? Excuse me . Calling Clara to the reception desk . Tell her a story . It 's too early . I usually put her to bed at 9 : 00 PM . Change of plans . She has a full battery of tests to do tomorrow morning . Why ? What do you mean , why ? Why change ? Listen , Clara . Clémence has to do a comprehensive test tomorrow , and she is leaving the clinic in a week . That 's how it is . You can read her a story later . Is Clara here ? What a city . It 's funny . When I first came to Paris , I hated it . Noise , cars , grey weather . I was hailing from the German countryside , so you can imagine . But I learned to discover Paris , to look at Paris . That Paris . Then I realized how lucky I was to study here and live in the most beautiful city in the world . Then a gift from God . I met your dad . One day , you were about four or five , you were sitting on his shoulders , you were very excited and I don 't know how it happened but you lost your teddy bear . It fell in the water . You cried and cried . You can 't imagine how much you cried . Do you remember ? What 's wrong ? Nothing . I 'm a little cold . Let 's go home . Light . It 's too bad Clara isn 't here . I 'm sure she would have liked it . How old do you think she is ? I don 't know . 36 , 37 years old . 56 . - You 're kidding . - No . As she says , Jacques is an artist . Behave . - Thank you . - Thank you . Your guilty pleasure . What 's wrong ? Is it too hot ? What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's just that I don 't like it . - No , you love that . - I 'm telling you , I don 't like it . Calm down . Hi . Everything happened too fast . Can I come in ? Why didn 't you say something ? It wouldn 't have changed anything . I have to go see the police investigation committee tomorrow . What are you searching for ? Listen , David . We work together . I can help you . Nicolov 's death is also my fault . And I will tell them that . But I can 't do anything if you don 't trust me a little bit . Talk to me , God damn it ! Tell me to fuck off , but say something . Marie , I 'm sure you 're a good cop with a bright future in the service . So tell them whatever you want . Sure , you 're right . It 's very smart to give up now , for someone who really wanted to find Helena . ... throughout the East on the Massif Central region as well as in the Alps . In the Northwest , expect some rain and winds of 100 to 1 30 mph . What are you doing here ? Three months ago , when he arrested him , Hoffman hit Nicolov in the knee . Send him to identification . We 've got a serious problem , Superintendent Miller . This man is not Dimitri Nicolov . Drown . Fucking ghost . I already killed you this morning . Who are you talking about ? Who are you talking about ? Who are you talking about ? Shit . ID # 1 25 614 asking for location of agent David Hoffman . Give me a few seconds . You should have a visual . He is less than three feet from you . Cancel everything . Where do these pictures come from ? From the surveillance camera above the bathtub . The accomplice couldn 't be identified ? No . Not even David . It 's very simple . The only case where a retinal scan can confuse two individuals is that of identical twins . That 's possible . David Hoffman . European police . Have you gone mad ? You 're bringing a policeman here to my clinic ? Untie him at once . You saved my life , Brügen . But I won 't let you give me orders . Connect him to your machine . I want to know what this motherfucker has done with my brother . That 's ridiculous . You know very well that the protocol is not that simple . I don 't give a shit about the protocol . It 's my machine . I 'll do what I want with it . Without me , you can 't do anything with it . You can 't use it , you can 't improve it . I thought we were in business together . We made a deal . Watch out , professor . Some people are ready to pay much more than you to use it . So stop fucking with me and do as I say . I think this man killed my brother . He was a piece of shit ... but he was my brother . I could have put a bullet through his brain , but that would be too quick . I have something better for you . I 'm going to erase everything you have in your little head . Are you in pain ? I must have broken a few ribs . I shot your pretty partner . But what really turns me on is what will happen tomorrow . We 're going to meet in the street , I 'll bump into you , you 'll say you 're sorry . - You 're completely crazy . - Yes ! And I could break your neck . So do as I say and hook him up . You don 't seem convinced . About your brother , 100 % . He was a loser . I got him in the carotid artery . It hurts , huh ? Open the door or I 'll kill her . What 's wrong ? Nothing . I keep having the same nightmare . It 's getting worse . You want to talk about it ? Listen , the treatment is going well . We 're getting good results . It 's almost over . How can you be so sure ? Manon . You 're all I have left . I know it 's tough . If you want , we can stop everything and you can go home . What 's the chair for ? Something to eat . Thank you . Where the hell were you ? I 've been looking for you for three days . - David ? - Over here , Mr. Hoffman . What are you doing ? He has to undergo a few tests . Who are you ? - Where is she ? - I don 't know . I thought you were going to operate this morning . Professor , these sessions are too close . I am afraid it could become dangerous . There 's no way I 'm going to stop the treatment when I 'm so close . Manon has almost entirely recovered her memory . I wouldn 't be so optimistic . This image has been recurrent for a month . It even interferes with the other images . All the more reason to intensify the sessions . In the end , it will disappear . Why be obsessed like this ? Because I have to . Excuse me . Look , Clara . I know what you do for us and I am very grateful . But we must persevere . Time is against us . You cannot give up now . Not now . She loves you so much . You know that . He suffered intense electroshocks . Powerful . Very powerful . A little bit like what put Tatiana in a coma . I talked to our colleague who examined him . And ? Average . I 'm kidding . These electroshocks touched a very specific area of the brain , the hippocampus . The center of what is called short term memory . Basically , that 's where our memories are stored , whereas long-term memory , located in the cortex , handles cognitive functions like learning how to write , riding a bike , shooting with a bow and arrow , holding a fork and a knife ... What does it mean ? It means he 's lost all memory ? What is strange is that the hippocampus has not been destroyed , simply short-circuited . It is as if it was emptied of its substance while keeping all its ability intact . I don 't understand . It looks like he can recreate memory ... but he has lost all past memories . Forgot it , so to speak . How can you treat him like that ? And who is this guy ? I have no choice . I don 't understand . Who is the boss here ? The same bad temper as her mother . What are you doing here ? Hello , Marie . Oh , I see . So you 've been controlling all this ? And I was all proud of my transfer . Don 't misunderstand Jean Becker . I needed a solid agent to supervise a delicate mission . We needed David to find Nicolov , but David is a mad dog . So your uncle had the idea of giving him a trustworthy partner . A trustworthy partner ? I call it a snitch . Marie . All this doesn 't explain why Homeland Security works hand in hand with the European police force . About a year ago , a military lab succeeded in digitizing the human memory process . It is called Chrysalis . It is capable of storing an individual 's memory and if need be to erase them . In the long term , the goal was to create the memory of a human being from scratch . I don 't need to explain the potential . Right . I don 't see the connection with Nicolov quite yet . The connection is that Nicolov stole the machine a few months ago . Right , sure . Nicolov is a former Bulgarian secret agent converted to organized crime . Today , he is directing a bidding war between foreign powers . Can you imagine an army of terrorists mentally conditioned by the memory of a fanatic ? Or a tyrant who is getting old transferring his memory to a younger body to stay in power ? A few weeks ago , Homeland Security lost Nicolov 's trace . Since David had investigated him it was a unique opportunity to gather our skills . Please , spare me your speech about Europol 's independence . He used you and you know it . Marie , we need you . It 's in your interest , in David 's interest . We can help him recover his memory . Chrysalis is not 100 % efficient . Neurologists have found that even with constant sessions , a core of memories always remains and they are impossible to erase . It appears that our worst pains stick in our brain more than the good memories . In any case , if you activate these traumas , you can start rebuilding your memory . So , in fact , you need me to remind David of his worst memories . Is that what you 're trying to tell me ? You probably know what Sarah meant to David . You 're disgusting . Our interests meet . So why are you complaining ? I am complaining because you want me to manipulate a guy who 's already lost it all . You 're not manipulating him . You 're helping him . Sure , like my uncle helped you . Maria Rosa , eight and a half years old . Put in intensive care in a Mexican hospital . Congestive heart failure since birth . Condition has been worsening for six months . Three cardiac arrests , two of them have affected body coordination . The surgery consists of an aortic valve replacement . Window . Music . Light . What happened here ? You were assaulted . Do you want to eat something ? You got shot . Were you there ? Not me . Sarah was there . The girl in the photo ? Was she my wife ? Yes . Is she dead ? Yes . Do you want to know the worst ? I can 't even remember the woman I loved . Are you all right ? Does this seven over four ring a bell ? Do you also need my memory ? Like them ? Is that what you think of me ? That I want to use you ? It looks like it runs in the family . Think whatever you want . You 've got a better idea ? Yes . Find Chrysalis . Before them , I mean . Before Homeland Security . Just you and I. And find Helena . Dimitri Nicolov . He 's the one you owe your amnesia to . Three months ago , you and Sarah almost arrested him . Why does he have four scratches and I have seven ? That 's the meaning of seven over four . That 's the meaning of seven over four . You understood , right ? I think we need to balance the light . Sometimes the hologram is too dense . Professor Brügen ? Go ahead , I 'll be right with you . Lieutenant Becker and Lieutenant Hoffman , European police . Can we talk ? As you can see on the screen , I have a patient waiting for me on the other side of the planet . I understand , but it 's important . I 'm listening . Why would a clinic specialized in cardiac surgery order various copies of a rather rare eye retractor ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . Why don 't you ask the person in charge of buying material ? You 'll find him on the first floor . Now , if you don 't mind , I would really like to concentrate on my surgery , okay ? Thanks . - Dimitri ? - Yes ? Hoffman is here with a colleague . Take care of my daughter . Okay . Hello . What 's his name ? Ben . Oh , you 're like Manon . What do you mean ? Yes , the scratches . Do you have a patient called Manon ? Yes , of course . The professor 's daughter . I have a headache . I 'll find some pills . No , it 's all right . You 'll feel better . I said it was all right . Come on . Come on . Leave her . What do you want ? Huh ? What do you want ? Leave me alone . Calling Clara to the reception desk . Are you all right ? Clara , what 's going on here ? I need to show you something . You 're still here ? You didn 't get hit hard enough ? I forgot . You 're amnesiac . Your mother loves you very much , you know . She will do anything for you to recover your memory . That 's why she agreed to let you participate in an experimental program . You don 't remember this place because every time you come here you are under anesthesia . What are you doing here ? Manon ? You 're a monster . - Manon , let me explain . - No , leave me alone . Let me explain . - No ! - Listen . - Leave me alone ! - Manon ! - Let me explain ! - Leave me alone ! - David . - Fire alert on the eighth floor . Fire alert on the eighth floor . - Manon ! - It 's not what you think . Take care of her . Wait . The transfer was just beginning to work . Don 't do that . She lied to me . She lied to me from the start . I was lied to as well . They stole all my memories . My past . I don 't even know who I am . Your name is Helena . Your drawings are heart-rendering . You want Hoffman to get better ? I can help you find his memory . Here . Everything is here . Agent Becker ? Give me your gun , Marie . - Who are you ? - Homeland Security . A friend of your uncle 's . Give me your gun , please . Thanks . Against the wall . On your knees . It was you ? By the canal , it was you . I think the press will love it . Homeland Security saves a dangerous criminal from the European police 's grip . I 'll let you explain what you were doing with the human guinea pigs that Nicolov was bringing you . In any case , please give the army my congratulations . Chrysalis , that 's some great work . It 's not the original , obviously . I wonder if you realize what is at stake with Chrysalis . It would have been a disaster if it had fallen into enemy hands . Needless to say , it would be most embarrassing for Homeland Security if something was to happen to David . That 's true of me , as well . I am going to disappear for a while . I know . Helena is a threat to them . If they find her someone needs to protect her . I understand . It seems to be something I do well . But I am here . She needs to learn who she is . Me too . It will take time . The guy I was scares me a little . I 'm not sure I want to be that guy again . Marie . Thank you .

 - Garrison ? - Yes . You got it ? It 's in the back of the truck . One of the last of the missing Trioxin-5 canisters . You have my money ? Whoa , whoa , whoa . We 're the ones asking the questions . Just give me my money and we can get out of here . Well , then nothing ... until you prove to us this canister ... is the real thing . Well , that 's impossible . You gentlemen will just have to take my word for it . No , friend , we will take his word for it . I thought Anita would be a good subject . She hasn 't any family left and she 's all set to be cremated in the morning . She was such a sweet girl . Accidentally , she drove her car into her swimming pool . Well , boys , let 's see if we can get a little bit of life back into the ... Shall we ? Now this may take a minute . It depends on the shape the corpse is in , the quality of the brain stem- - Cut the chatter , just do it already ! Well ? So ? Where is the part where she gets up and goes for the whole brain buffet ? You know , I don 't understand it . Maybe I , uh , I didn 't release enough gas . You think we are stupid or something ? Trying to slip us decoy ? Tell me , do we look stupid to you ? Listen , this is the original canister . I know because I obtained it myself . I was a top secret government official . Yeah , yeah , I 'm sorry , try it on him . Go on ! Give me that ! Just type the code . Look , look ! Brain ! He wants my brains ? Gino , if that 's all he 's after , you have nothing to worry about , my friend . Oh , shut up ! Go for the head , man . Help ! Sorry , Mr. Eusner ! Brains . Don 't just stand there , shoot the son of a bitch ! Now you believe me ! Bye-bye , fat boy . K to the I to the L to the L. We 'll kill you , we 'll thrill you , we 'll leave your team in pain . And when we drag you across the court , you 'll leave a greasy stain . We 'll put you 6 feet under , we 'll make you cry and sniff . We 'll give you rigor mortis , and keep you high and stiff . We 'll beat you , we 'll eat you , you 'll make a tasty snack . And if you think you 'll get away , you must be high on crack . And up ... and down . And up ... and down . And up ... Are the girls here ? Over there . - Hey , guys . - Hey . Guys , get back to work . And down . Don 't they look so cute in their uniforms ? Totally . So , what are you guys doing for Halloween this Saturday ? Oh , my brother is having another one of his raves . Think we 're probably going to go to that . What are you and Artie going to do ? - The nasty . - Shut up . Seriously . Right , two . Left , two . So what 's up with you and Jenny ? You guys seem like you 're getting pretty tight . Yeah , you could say that . Up ... two , down . She 's special . Hang on to her bro ' . Up , two , down , two . Up , two , down , two , up , two , down ... Son , I have some bad news for you . Come on , guys , let 's hit the showers . What 's up ? My uncle 's been killed . Sorry , man . What the hell ? Julian . Oh , Jenny , God , you scared me . Artie told me . Are you okay ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm fine . Thanks . What 's in there ? I don 't know . I 've lived in this house 18 years , never once heard my parents even talk about this room . I wonder why they never mentioned it . I don 't know , but my uncle used to spend a lot of time up here . Maybe there 's something in here he didn 't want us to know about . Like ? That . Well , what are they ? I don 't know , but I hope it 's not more trouble . Looks like there used to be three of them . It 's a digital lock . Looks like there 's some contact information here . Looks like somebody scratched the number off . Well , maybe they 're supply canisters , or maybe there 's money inside . Maybe it 's a medical experiment . Let 's go find Cody . If that science nerd can 't figure out what this is , no one can . Why do you drive so slow ? Stop telling me how to drive , Gino . I wouldn 't if you weren 't such a terrible driver . I have just two words for you , my friend , and that 's " pecking order . " Searching for these canisters is like searching for needle in flapjack . It 's haystack , Gino . Searching for needle in haystack . Yeah , yeah , whatever . Last year , Mikhail and Sergey found five T-5 canisters , and the agency gave them a case of Cristal and a trip to Euro Disney . Those things must be worth a fortune . God forbid the day when one of those canisters falls in the hands of the deviant mind . Go ! Go ! Go , Cody ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Cody ! A Doctor of intoxicology ! What the hell is that ? Tofu kielbasa . I don 't think so . What 's that about ? Yo , yo , check it . This is DJ Jeremy J. keeping this wax spinning and giving a shout out to the lovely ladies from Delta Kappa for keeping them high beams on . Oh , oh , oh , very nice . Very nice . That 's what I 'm talking about . Only your momma should be so proud . Oh , y 'all don 't forget , next Saturday , Halloween , the mother of all raves . It 's going to be tight , so , you get your booty over here , and I 'll hook you up with your VIP entrance token . You know you want them . Oh , and give it up for my sister Jenny and her friendly boy toy , Julian " The Man " Garrison . Hey , Julian , how 's it hanging , dude ? Have you guys seen Cody anywhere ? There he is . Later , dude . I told you this was some good shit . We need to hook up with that guy again , man . Well , well , well , well , well , hello , young lovers . Looking to get your party on ? Hello , Skeet . Maybe you 're looking for a hookup . Weed to speed , Skeet 's got what you need . Maybe our next life . Cody . We need your help . There 's something I got to show you . So , do you have any idea what it is , Code ? It looks like an atomic beer keg . Well , it was my parents ' attic . I think it was my uncle 's . Maybe it 's candy , you know , like a big metallic pi√±ata . You 're not laughing , man . Will you get serious ? Look , can you just take it back to the chem lab and try to figure out what it is ? Okay , I can do it . Don 't tell anyone . All right , I 'll take a look at it first thing in the morning . Or I can drop everything and check it out right now . Jeremy is about to pack up anyway . Thanks . There 's no telling who may be looking for this thing . Control said it was 2509 Buckingham Avenue . What is this place , anyway ? The residence of the late Charles Garrison . If there are any more canisters , they are probably hidden here . I have good feeling about this one . Yeah , my old friend , it 's about time Aldo Serra finally gets what he has coming to him . Once we go home heroes , there 's nothing more than pussy , discotheque , caviar , and a swimming pool with a big slide . Here . Yep . How we gonna get in ? You , my friend , are partnered with a trained professional . There is no barricade built these skillful hands cannot penetrate . Capisci ? Eh , Comrade ? Thanks . Cody will find out what 's going on . Don 't worry . I know . Hey . Hey , you guys got to see this . Gino , my man . I think we 've hit the jackpot . I can taste the champagne already . You had better believe it , brother . Here . Take picture . Well , welll , well , aren 't you a shutterbug . I found it . It 's my picture you should be taking . Well , take mine first and then I 'll take yours second . Gino , do I have to remind you that I outrank you ? All right , all right , give me the camera . Well , come on , what are you waiting for ? Looks like somebody 's been here before us . The President won 't be happy until we recover all the missing units . So what is this thing ? They say the obvious answer is usually the answer . So Jeremy and I figured out that the liquid we 're hearing inside this thing could be some polystyrene or napthalene-based compound . Napalm . Right . But then again , there were no sign of those components whatsoever . So I went to my second hypothesis here , which is maybe this could be some kind of chemical agent container . Nerve gas . Right . But then again , there were no signs of nitrogen or bisulfide , so that ruled that out . Okay ... so what is it ? Funny you should ask , Julian . Whatever this thing is contains traces of methylene and petroleum-based ether . And even a larger amount of dioxymethamphetamine . I am totally lost , Cody . Would you speak English ? Ecstasy . No , not ecstasy , dumb-ass , but something with very similar chemical qualities . Hallucinogens . Come with me , Julian . Let me show you . You guys , I have a really bad feeling about this . You sure about this stuff ? Sometimes the obvious answer isn 't always the answer . Well , there 's only one way to find out . No , Jeremy , don 't . Jeremy ! Don 't do that ! Jeremy . Could someone put on some music ? This dumb motherfucker . I 'm fine . Nothing 's even happening . Jeremy . Jeremy . Are you okay ? Are you okay , J ? Should we call for help ? What if he dies ? Jeremy . Are you okay ? Are you okay , J ? Hey , maybe we should call for help . Whoa ! Yeah ! That was tight , man ! Was I right ? You were more than right . I was tripping my brains out . It takes you to the height of ecstasy ... and then , to the brink of death . And just when you think you just can 't take any more , bam ! You 're back in reality . What are we going to do ? Let 's just call the police and get rid of it . Are you crazy ? I want to do it again ! Hook me up . - We 're going to be rich ! - Hell , yeah ! No ! I 'm taking it back to my house . Are you nuts ? No one even knows you have this thing . No , Jeremy . Look , he 's right . He 's right . Look , we don 't even know what this shit really is , man . Maybe it is something . So , look , it 's going on 4 : 00 right now , and I 'm going to go ahead and unhook everything , and I 'm going to swing by after class tomorrow . I 'm gonna help you bring all this stuff back to your parents ' place , okay , buddy ? - Good . - All right . But stay out of it . Cody 's right . We don 't even know what this thing really is . All right , all right . Don 't worry about it , Julian . I 'm gonna take care of everything . You can trust me . I 'll hook it up . All right , buddy . Jackpot ! Yeah ! Money ! So when 's your uncle 's funeral ? Tomorrow . Look ... I 'm really sorry about all the bad things that have happened to you . I 'll just be happy when I 'm past all this and everything 's back to normal . Look . I 'm going to kill them . So what does it do ? Dude , check this out . Take one part ecstasy , mix in a little ' shroom trip , add just a dash of life after death and bang ! You 've got yourself a hit of Z ! Is it safe ? Oh , yeah . Yeah , it doesn 't drain your spinal fluid or anything , does it ? Well , you got to have one for that to happen , bro ' . What 's the Z stand for ? It 's because when you 're tripping you just stand there , like you 're a zombie . But it 's totally safe . I test it , all the time . Listen , if you can 't trust your drug dealer , who can you trust , huh ? All right . Hook us up . Give me 10 . Oh , yeah , one more thing ... Only take one hit at a time . I don 't want any of you lightweights ending up in a hospital . It 's bad for business . Have a nice trip . Hey , what are you doing ? Didn 't you just hear what he said ? He 's a drug dealer . If he was so smart , he 'd be in another business . It 's still connected . Cody ! Give it to me , give it to me ... Give it to me , give it to me ... - Cody ! - Give it to me ! What are you doing ? I just figured at some point that the army or someone will come in and take this thing back . I mean , you guys heard Jeremy . This is good stuff . I mean , why not cash in while we can ? I mean , and spread the joy . That type of thing , you know ? I 'm going to kill you . We don 't even know what this thing is , dipshit . Come on , Julian , you saw Jeremy . I mean , he was rolling for a few minutes , then he was totally fine . Hey , man , this stuff is absolutely harmless . Cody , disconnect the canister , now . I 'm taking it back to my house . Hey , you guys , feel anything yet ? No . You don 't think that greasebag ripped us off , do you ? He better not have because I swear to God , I will ... What ? You 're going to fart on him ? You guys all right ? Well , what 's wrong ? Should I call for help ? Should I bring you something ? Brains ! - Brains . - Brains . - Brains . - Brains . I can 't believe you , man . Is this all of them ? That better be everything . It 's everything , man , I pro--I promise . All right , let 's load it up . Let 's get it out of here . God , I can 't believe them . All I wanted to do was figure out what this is so we could go to the press . Why don 't we take it to the genetics lab , maybe I can run a few more tests . You can keep it there until you decide what to do with it . Thanks . Bye , guys . I 'm going to go outside and wait for Artie . Bye , Beck , don 't do anything we wouldn 't do . Ha ha , that leaves me wide open . Okay , bye . Hey . Chucky ? Hey , John . Hey , Tyler , What are you guys doing ? - Brains . - Brains . Tell me something I don 't already know . What are they doing ? I think they 're hammered again . Stupid skanks ! Stupid John scratched me . Oh , no , no , no , not now . Not now . Come on , Chucky . We 're frat brothers . We 're supposed to share everything . Especially when it comes to internal organs . 400 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 1 1 , 12 , 13 , 1 4 . - Here 's your cut . 1 , 400 smackers . - Yeah . Woowee ! Don 't get no better than this . - You bet ya . - All right . Huh ? Come here , babe . All right . Oh , no ! Brains ! Brains ! Hey , man , you want to jam with us ? Help me ! Help me ! They 're after me ! Who 's after you , bro ' ? Them ! Brains . What is this stuff ? Yeah , what do you care ? It 's not like we don 't have other things we should be focusing on . Like I thought you were going to help me with my colon cleansing lab today . You can 't do that . What are you doing ? A little experiment . Calm down . No ! You can 't just go dripping crap into their water like that . How 'd you like it if someone did that to you ? They 're lab rats , Brett . That 's what they 're here for . No . No ! Not Mr. Stinky . Brett ! Jenny . This rat has a brilliant mind . I will not have you poison him with your boyfriend 's party supplies . Okay . Fine . He can be the control group . Thank you . Are you feeling all right , babe ? You haven 't said a word since I picked you up . It 's going to be right , babe . You 're going to be saying more than " mmm " when I 'm done with you . Damn , girl ! Didn 't you have time to hit the shower ? Babe ? Brains ! Gee , girl ! Slow down . Usually I don 't get none of that unless I take you to the Olive Garden . Aw , what a mess . What 's in the bag ? Aw , horrific . Brain . We 're closing in , Gino . The dragnet is getting tighter and tighter . It 's about time we made ourselves a new friend . Interpol . Can I help you ? Interpol . Okay . Julian Garrison ? Nephew of Charles Garrison ? Yeah . I 'm Aldo Serra . And this is my partner , Gino Corelli . On behalf of our organization , we would like to extend to you our deepest sympathies . We were wondering if you could put your grief aside for a moment and let us ask you a few questions . Sure . We are under special orders to find out what exactly occurred when your uncle was murdered . Have you been at his house lately ? No , um ... why ? Well , we 've been informed that after he passed , somebody broke into his house and took something that belongs to us . Something very important . You wouldn 't happen to know anything about that something , would you ? No , um ... what , exactly , are you looking for ? Well , I wish I could tell you , but that 's classified information . I tell you what . If you can think of anything that might help us in our investigation , give us a call . We 're at Motel 6 . Just off the Interstate . Okay . Thanks . What do you think ? What do I think ? I think this boy knows exactly what it is we are looking for . And we are going to follow his every move . But first , we go get Krispy Kreme . Who was that ? Interpol ? They were asking questions about my uncle . They 're looking for the canister . What did you tell them ? Nothing . Julian , I 'm really starting to freak out about this . I 'm going to go to the lab . Oh , hey , Julian , want to come with me up to the rave site ? We 're starting our setup for tonight , and I could really use a hand , bro ' . Go ahead . I 'll call you if anything develops . Hell , yeah ! We 're going to rave to the grave . Yeah . Greetings and salutations . You guys ready for a Halloween no one 's going to forget ? Damn straight . Are you okay , man ? I don 't know , man . Just a cold , I think . Aw , man , nothing that 's going to screw up our DJ 's voice ? I hope . No , man . No bug or germ will cause me to fail . After the show , I 'll still get plenty of tail . You know this . Now let 's get busy . What 's in there ? What are you doing here so early ? Brett , you scared me . Sorry , just came in here to feed Mr. Stinky . What ? What 's that noise ? Look at him go . I wonder what 's come over him . Maybe he 's just happy to see you . Yeah . Did you put that crap into his water ? What 's wrong ? Mr. Stinky bit me . Bad Mr. Stinky . It 's gonna be a hell of a party . Yeah , party swarming with fine , fine ladies , searching for a man with higher intellect . What about Shelby ? Hey , I 'm a equal opportunity defiler . I 'm a monster . That cold bugging you ? Yeah , man , I don 't know . Yeah , you should see Skeet , man , maybe he 's got some Vitamin C or some zinc in that stash of his , you know ? Speaking of Skeet , check it out . Damn . He 's tripping his brains out . Hey , that chick 's in my pottery class . Who 's that , man ? Brains ! It 's Becky and Artie . They 're already in costume . Brains ! Hey , dude , back off ! You 'll break me . You 're ruining my high . Back off . I said back off , man ! Back off , both of you . Back off ! I said back off ! Back off . Back off , man . Back off . Oh , my God . This ain 't happening , man . I 'm just tripping . Back off with you ! Back off , back off , both of you . Back off ! I 'm just tripping . I 'm just tripping . Come on , man , let 's check it out . Come on . - Back off ! - What are you doing ? Hey , what the hell 's wrong with them ? - The speaker wires . - Yeah , yeah , yeah ! Come on . See ! I 've told you he was up to no good . We should move in . No , no , no , looks like they got things in control . I say we sit tight for a while and see what unfolds . He may have T-5 canisters hidden somewhere around here . We gotta get ' em to the emergency room . Dude , I can 't leave here . This is how I pay my tuition . I invested my life savings in this crap . Yeah , and I 'm on my bike . Who 's gonna take them ? Hey , we 're going for some rolling papers . You guys want anything ? That 's who . Just look at him . He 's jonesing . You better hope nothing happens to him or it 's gonna be your ass . I 'm sorry , Brad , I don 't know what I was thinking . I need to go to my study group . I 'll be back in a few hours to check on Mr. Stinky . You little party animal . You 're gonna have one hell of a hangover . God . Jesus . Brains ! Don 't bogart that . Dude , slow down . How fast we going , anyway ? 35 . Dang , all right , all right . Uptight Saturday night in the back seat . Where are you guys from , anyway ? Brains . Whoa , never been there , but I got a cousin who lives in Fresno , though . So what 's with the non-party ' tude ? Yeah , it 's Friday , man . No , it 's not . Right on . Anyhow , you seem like an open-minded couple . Don 't you ever want to cut loose and go crazy ? Dude , that 's totally gay , man . Thank God ! Help us , man ! Help ! Help us , man ! Hey ! Help- - Bullshit . No ... bull 's-eye . In the name of Isis , Goddess of the sun and life , I bless all of those lost souls from thine beloved animal kingdom tragically banished to the fiery hell of the fast food grill . Is that good ? Totally . Brett . Happy Halloween , Brett , D 'Artagnan and Rainbow and I were just about to start our discussion on the evils of eating meat . Would you care to join us ? Oh , my God . Hello ? - Julian , it 's Jenny . - Hey . Somebody opened the canister . There 's some kind of goo everywhere . You okay ? I 'm fine , just get over here now . Okay , I 'm on my way . What the hell ? Mr. Stinky ? Brains . Brains ! Oh , thank God . Something 's wrong with Mr. Stinky . I don 't know where he is . He got out . Who ? Brad 's rat . I gave the rats some of that stuff from the container , and something is seriously wrong with him , Julian . They 're acting crazy . Okay , okay . Mr. Stinky ? - Let 's check it out . - Oh , man ! Well , whatever was in there , it 's gone now . You guys . I found Mr. Stinky . Looks like he 's acquired a taste for brains . What , what , what ? Oh , God , they 're all out . Okay , you guys grab those two , I got Mr. Stinky . Mr. Stinky ? Shoot . Brains . Brains . Awesome costumes , Brett . Brains ! Stop ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Did you find him ? No , but I made a couple of friends . Brains . - Brains . - Brains . Brains . Run , everybody ! Get out of here ! Hey ! Coach Savini . Where are you going ? Brains ! Howdy , ma 'am . You can relax . The good guys are here . Ah ! Son of a bitch ! My bad . This way . - Come on ! - Let 's go . Brains . You guys are always late . Jenny . Are you okay ? Thank God that 's over . Uh , you guys ... Brains ! Brains ! Class dismissed . Now , what was it you were saying about not seeing any canister ? So this is the stuff that 's reanimating the dead ? Yeah . It 's just the proof we need to show what the military is up to . You will prove nothing to nobody . Have building quarantined . I want full clean-up . The canister will be destroyed and you will forget you ever saw it . Look , the most important thing is that it 's all over now . Cody ? It is all over now , isn 't it ? Cody ? Look , your brother and I , we- - We just thought we could score some extra cash , you know . Stuff didn 't seem like it hurt anyone . I mean , you saw it for yourself , right ? What did you guys do ? I didn 't give you everything we made . And Skeet had already taken off with about 500 hits of Z , man . 500 hits ? Jeremy 's rave ! Yo , yo , yo . F your money , grab your honey . If you 're single then you mingle . Tonight 's the night , it 's Halloween , and this is the place where it 's hip to be seen . You got to say fuck it and misbehave , so ... take a smile on your face from the rave to the grave ! Damn , maybe it 's worse than a cold . Hey , Superfly . Have you seen Cody ? Nah ! Ain 't seen him . Okay . Hey , man , you got some Z ? Sorry , dudes , the well 's dry . Hang tight . I think I know where I can score some more . Let me know if you need any more Z. Jeremy . Hey , J. Damn , you look awful . Yeah , man , I feel like shit . You look like it , too . You know where I can score some more Z ? I 'll kick you in for a cut . Hold on . Dude , no offense , man , but keep your ass back . I don 't want to get whatever it is you got . Thanks . You know , maybe there won 't be any of those things at the rave . Maybe we 'll get there in time . Maybe the kids haven 't dropped any of the pills yet . Too many maybes . Maybes will get you killed . Yeah , he 's right . And based on what we 've seen , I think if somebody drops some Z they become a zombie no matter what . And the more they take , the quicker they zombify , dependent on body mass , weight , age and other factors . But Jeremy ? He may have only had a small sample , but it 's only a matter of time before he ... - It might be too late for him , babe . - No ! Maybe we can still save him . Another maybe . Let 's go . It 's going to be great . First of all we have to find this friend of yours , Skeet , and confiscate all the remaining Z pills . If you come across any living dead , aim for the head . Look , guys , I got to find Shelby and get her ass out of there before something happens to her . We 'll look for Jeremy . Hey . Enough talk ! Wait a minute . You guys can 't go in there dressed like that . If the kids see you , they 'll panic . She 's right . You guys stick out like narcs at a Sunday school picnic . You need costumes , man . Excuse me . Is this Jeremy 's rave ? Where 's the DJ booth ? It 's up there , but it looks empty . Look , I 'm going after Shelby . Come on , let 's take a closer look . This way . This way . Excuse me . Pardon me . Diane , have you seen Shelby ? Last time I saw her , she was over there . Yeah , all right ... come on , let 's go . This goes out to all the ladies . Jeremy . Here 's for all the locals here on Halloween . We 're all slaves to the rave . Let 's see the headlights , honeys . Boy , she can really move . - Have you seen this kid ? - No , man . Look that way , I 'll look this way . Hey , you . Hey , have you seen Skeet ? Brains . Gino ! Gino ! Thank you , my friend . I 'm going to recommend you for a commendation . I 'd rather have a case of Cristal . Let 's go . Hey ! Some creep stole our costumes . Brains . Brains . Hey , where 's Jenny ? I don 't know . I got to go find her . Look , you be careful . All right . Shelby ! Hey ! Shelby , come on ! We got to get out of here . Let 's go ! What ? I can 't hear you . Come on , let 's go ! God ! Goddamn it . Fuck ! Jenny ! Have you seen Jenny ? Hey ! Jenny ! Where the hell is he ? Jeremy ? Jeremy , it 's me , Jenny . Brains ! Is he okay ? Brains . Julian . I 'm not letting you out of my sight again . We 've got to find Jeremy . No way . It 's too dangerous . We gotta get out of here . But I 've gotta try to- - Listen , I 've already lost my uncle , no way I 'm losing you , too . Well , I don 't want to lose my brother . Jenny , you already have lost him . He 's one of them now . Come on , just stay with me , okay ? Brains . Move . Come on , move ! Come on , get the fuck out of the way , man ! Goddamn . Shelby , get down ! Oops . I hope he was a zombie . No ! Cody ! My God ! Cody ! Hey , get off of me . Get off of me ! Get off me ! Skeet ! Skeet , get off . Skeet , get off of me . Cody ! Oh , no ! My God , Cody ! I would advise you to get out of here , young lady . Get out of here . Don 't do this . Go on , get out of here . Go ! Julian . Look out , look out . Hurry . Julian ! Wait ! Jeremy . Brains . No , don 't . We have to . Brains . Sorry , man . Shit . Come on , shoot him ! Shoot him ! Okay , come on . No , you had to do it . You had to do it . Jenny , Jenny ! Come on now . Be strong . We have to get out of here . Come on . Hurry ! Look , here they are . Time to clean up and go . It may be too late . Another maybe . Brains . You know how I hate maybes . Come on , let 's go . Call for backup . General , code black . We need assistance . Requesting backup immediately . Yes . Yes , sir , yes . Thank you , sir , thank you . Thank you . Is help coming ? The Americans have already been alerted . The general says they 've dealt with this problem before and know exactly what to do . Maybe they 're sending a transport to get us out of here . Let 's go for a clearing . Shelby . Come on , follow us . Come on . Oh , no . Come on . I know a place we can go . Shelby . No , Jenny , come on , she 's dead . Come on . Hurry . I regret there will be no case of Cristal for you , my friend . And no Euro Disney . Come on , hurry . That 's a roger . Missile 's on its way . Come on , let 's check outside . Holy sweet Jesus ! Damn . I guess I was right . This sure was a hell of a party . Hello , guys . Have you seen Gino ? - No . - No . Let 's get the hell out of here before the army comes , yeah ? Come on !

 Yokosuka at twilight ... Hey . Who 's he ? That singer . Wasn 't he a Grammy Award winner ? Who cares . I guess . Can 't understand a word he 's saying . He 'll be banished from the country . This is probably his last night . He won 't be missed . I 've been listening to you guys . He 's trying his very best . Don 't be so mean ! The Americans ' lack of ability to learn Japanese is becoming an issue . Former President of the United States , Pepitone Tell us your views as a representative of the country . The language is difficult . But we Americans are trying very hard . The Japanese people should look more kindly on us . But language isn 't the only issue concerning the Americans . You have the highest number of crimes , homelessness and prostitution . You may all be deported . But if you desert us , there 's nowhere else we can go ! There 's always Tibet and Pamirs . The mountaintop of Kilimanjaro . That 's a place for savages ! This is definitely your fault , for all I know . Former Secretary of State , Lineback You shouldn 't have given up the U.S. Military bases to Japan . That 's why ! They wouldn 't have let us enter Japan if we hadn 't . We should have carried out a coup . With all the ammunition ... we could have taken over this tiny island ! Prime Minister . What 's up ? Prime Minister , Junjiro Yasuizumi Um ... The Japanese seasons are wonderful ! I love these pickles ! Oh you do , huh ? He loves pickles . Mr. Yasuizumi comes here often . I know . All the former presidents are here . He 's probably keeping an eye on them . They 're crowding up our place . They 're all thirsty for information from us media people . Any news from Professor Tadokoro ? Former President of Russia , Svesinicov We 're not from the science magazines . Ask Mr. Goto . He was at the press conference . When will he come ? How the hell should I know ? Good evening . When the Northern Territories sank , you seemed quite disturbed . You claim they were yours , huh ? No , they were never ours . Is that so ? Stop kidding . Nippon banzai ! We love Nippon ! Hello , China and Korea . Where have you been today ? Former President of Korea , Kim We 've just come back from the memorial shrine . Former President of China , Cho It was inspirational ! Good for you . The only God is here in Japan . You keep praying . We 've reserved you a V.I.P. room . This way . How strange . They used to be so offensive . I wish they 'd all drown . Your really hate them , don 't you ? But your wife ... Stop right there . Sorry . Hello ... Hello ... That 's all you say How did I become like this ? It all began three years ago . " THE WORLD SINKS EXCEPT JAPAN " a novel by YASUTAKA TSUTSUI an original story by SAKYO KOMATSU supervised by AKIO JITSUSOJI directed by MINORU KAWASAKI Catherine , let 's take a bath . Three Years Ago , Year 201 1 Come on . Come on . No , you can 't . 10 years after 9.1 1 , the United States of America sank under the sea . New York is sinking ? How long will it last ? What about the tsunami that struck the West Coast ? The San Andreas Fault has split ? People stuck at Kansas City Airport are flooding out into the runway . A boycott ? Our reporter says the airplanes are running people over . That sounds worse than the Titanic . Tell him to come back immediately . He 's weeping over the phone . The President just left Washington on Air Force One . What ? It 's on TV ! The Earth goes crazy ! Amidst this crisis ... the President of America has left the country with his fellow officials . Here is his statement . I 'll follow America until the last bit of American land ... sinks into the Ocean . Like all the leaders , I want to protect the American continent . The last bit of soil disappears , America must go forward . Americans , for the sake of the world , for democracy , for Americans ' hopes and dreams , must survives . That is the duty of every American . Thank you very much . Those of you , who were left behind , please be patient . It is our hope that many countries that are benefited from America generously , will do their best to help us in this , at our hour or need . I love our American land , our great history , our culture , and our American way . I 'd like to sing a song for my homeland , I send you all my love . People are gonna kill him . Where is he heading ? The U.S. Military base in Okinawa . Our government ? The Chief Cabinet Secretary will hold a conference . Call all the ambassadors and see if ... they have room for American refugees . I 'll try , but we 're having a hard time getting our colleagues home ! Catherine , I can 't have you flying to America . Calm down ... Hey . Call you back . Your wife 's family is in Texas . Don 't you have to be with her ? A worldwide disaster like this doesn 't happen everyday . I 'm staying right here . What 's up ? New American Airlines flight 427 has just crashed . 4000 passengers were on board with a capacity for 500 . No wonder it crashed . Thanks , bye . New American Airlines flight 427 has just crashed ! Use the chopper . Official Residence of the Prime Minister What do you mean that this isn 't the end ? Professor Tadokoro You 're saying , the Earth still has energy left after having sunk America ? There seems to be a mantle plume activity under the continent ... which is stirring up all the mantles below the Earth . Expecting another tectonic movement ? Correct . Tell me , Professor . What 's happening down there ? As a reaction to the mantle plume activity ... the ocean floor mantle under the Eurasian Plate ... rushed right below where the American continent had been . Therefore , the mantle underneath the Pacific Plate ... lost its support and is being pushed all the way ... Professor . Enough about below . What will happen on the surface ? How could one talk about the surface without acknowledging the actions below ? That 's just like opening a window on a windy day ... and forever going after those scattered papers . Then shut the windows . You 're right . I leave you in charge . Please continue . A Prime Minister 's job is like an errand boy 's . What should we do next ? Do what is necessary . Of course . You do know what 's going to happen in the near future , don 't you ? I 'm afraid so . Tell me . Professor ? Professor ! Are you alright ? Huh ? Oh ... The mere thought of the tragedy that awaits us ... made my brain dive deep inside the core of Earth . Professor . America has sunk . Nothing will surprise me now . What 's going to happen to Japan ? Will it sink , too ? How should I say this ... Just spill it out . Japan is going to sink , right ? Quite the opposite . Excuse me . This is how we will be receiving refugees at the U.S. Military bases . We 'll announce this at the press conference today . It 's been announced that Australia is accepting 15 million refugees , England 12 million . As an ally , we must give them a considerable number . Will the bases be enough ? How about Okinotori Island ? Okinotori ? You mind your own business . Chief Cabinet Secretary , Date You must decide quickly . The refugees are flooding in . Their numbers are increasing . Alright.Contact the Defence Agency Director-General . This is Date . The Prime Minister would like to speak with you . Hey Shin ! I need your advice . No ! You must say , no ! Defense Agency Director-General , Shinzaburo Ishiyama Don 't accept the refugees . Not without making a few propositions . Make them give up the bases . They were ours to begin with . Why should all that land belong to them ? If you don 't take appropriate measures , we 'll be seeing a lot of trouble . And tell them to hand over all the ammunition unconditionally . Tell them , no ! No ! Los Angeles Private Jet Hangar Jerry , can you live in the country only yellow monkeys ? Believe me , Elizabeth , with our world famous , we 'll be in TV , movies , commercials , kabuki , sumo . We 'll be all over the place . We 'll be huge . I never played sumo before . Don 't worry . See ? Our part will be done by some CG skills . We 'll be yokozuma . Hello , Gucas ! You are ready to go ? Yes , listen , I want you to be in my Japanese movie Are you kidding ? I 'm glad ! She 'll do , right ? Sure . I 've told you . Listen , I brought lots of cash , so we have to spend the rest of our life at high style . Good , because I don 't like Japanese movie . They looks so cheap ! Yeah , me too . Hey , listen , our next house , let 's make it float . It will be like ... a hovercraft . Oh , you 're fantastic ! It must have been a shock to you when the American continent sank . It 's a ... it 's really been a ... like a nightmare . It 's ... gonna take a while for Elizabeth and I to truly get over this huge tragedy . In the meantime , we 're going to keep on , trying to progress in our craft ... for all our fans around the world . And I think that 'll be the best things to do with the memories of our friends ... that are no longer with us , and also our countries . I see . What is the most precious thing that you brought to Japan ? Well , of course , is my dear wife Elizabeth . Oh , Jerry ! And this . What kind of movies would you like to be in ? Oh , we 're new in here , so I guess anything you bring us ... samurai , sword fighter , turtle ninja , sushi ... many things , bring it on . Thank you . We wish you both the very best . Good luck in Japan . Thank you . Excuse me . My name is Koga . I 'm a producer of Tani TV . Elizabeth , I 've been you fan since I read this . Oh ... Look , you get plenty of fans in Japan . - Excuse me , could you sign this ? - OK . Thank you very much . Elizabeth , can you be on my show ? Yes , of course ! Great , we 'd love to . We look forward to working with you , Mr. Koga . " Eight Days ' Trip to Los Angeles and New York ! " I 'm home . You should lie down . I can 't get the tickets to Dallas . Not even to Houston . Catherine , you 'll wearing yourself out . Get some sleep . I 'm expecting a call from Mother . I 'll wake you up . Go to your bed and rest . All I have is you . You 're all I have in this world . Catherine . We must have hope . I 've heard that there are 8.5 million people on ships heading to China . Your parents may be on it . Joey , too . Really ? Let 's hope so . " Koga " I 'm home . You 're back . You must be tired . I am . I thought you 'd never come home with all the commotion in America . So did I. TV 's on for 24 hours . People outside our company are helping us now . So I 'll be home regularly . I 'm glad . Your bath 's ready . I 'll have a glass of beer first . Here you are . Thanks . Tastes good ! How about it ? But I 'll get tipsy . I don 't mind . Alright . Lovely . Let 's eat . Yes , let 's . Today 's dinner is very Japanese . With the shortage of soybeans from America , I couldn 't get tofu . That 's right . Japan relies on imported foods from America . Meat and vegetables have become so expensive . The supermarket seemed like Tiffany 's . I can imagine . What shall we do when we 're out of beer ? Then we 'll switch to shochu . Don 't worry . We 'll get used to it . Sure . By the way , didn 't Elizabeth Clift come to Japan yesterday ? Yeah , I was at the airport . Here . Wow ! She 's come to Japan with Jerry . Japanese movies may catch up with Hollywood . We 'll be seeing a lot of Hollywood stars from now on . Can 't wait . Here . Thank you . Help us raise funds for the Americans . Donations please . A week later , the continent of China started to sink . The following week ... the Eurasian continent sank . Two days later , Africa sank . The next day , Australia sank . Until the Earth was left with one country ... The Present , Year 2014 Give me a chance ! Hey . Do something funny for 100 yen . You give me money ? Great , you got me . That 's only worth 10 yen . You try . I 'll fix it . Where 's my eyeball ? Like it ? Nonsense . Here 's five yen . So what 's your point ? Answer , United Nations . Yeah , United Nations . Prime Minister . I want you to consider distributing some land to each country . Former United Nations Secretary General , Dempsy Can 't promise you anything , but I 'm open to ideas . Go on , United Nations . Yeah . Give Ueno Park to America . Why ? Tell us . Yeah . There 's Ame-Yoko next to Ueno Park . " Ame " stands for " America " , so that should be convenient . Are you out of your mind ? That 's impossible . Besides , " Ame " originally means " sugar " not " America " . It was a place where people sold sugar after the war . However , during the Korean War , American goods were traded there . So some called it " American-Yokocho " . But originally , it means " candy " . In other words , " sugar " . You should study harder . No good at all ! China and Korea ! Since when have you both become Japan 's slaves ? Japan invaded your countries ! So ? That part of history has sunk and disappeared with our land . Water under the bridge . Correct answer ! Give him a cushion . Here you are . Out of my way ! Here you are , Goto . You 've been to the Professor 's press conference . Yep . He talked about tectonic movements of the past three years and what 's to come . We all know that the carbon dioxide has built up to a dangerous level . As a result , the glaciers melted , and the waters began to cover the land . At the same time , the mantle under the Pacific started to heat up . The convection current ... The convection current that lies under the Pacific and the Asian continent ... is called the ocean-floor mantle . This boiling hot mantle traveled its way toward the Japanese islands ... and has crashed into the continental mantle underneath . Boom ! As the mantle pushed up Japan , the sea level rose rapidly . Thus damaging the ocean basin at the same time . With this , the boundary between the crust and the mantle ... called the Mohorovicic discontinuity , shattered to pieces . The mantle had always been moving toward Japan , four centimeters per year . But all of a sudden , it picked up speed ! Japan was pushed violently toward the Asian continent ... and has now moved onto a sunken land . Splashing our way on top of the continent of China ! You mean , Japan is literally on top of China now ? Whereabouts ? The North China Plain ? Not so loud . The Chinese could be here . They 're busy kissing the Prime Minister 's ass . What did the Professor say about the future ? Yeah , what did he say ? Well ... Just recently ... I 've discovered a connection between the air mass and the convection current . As a result , Japan will ... What will happen to Japan ? He disappeared from the room ? Sure did . You just watched him leave ? Why didn 't you go after him and bring him back ? Oh , shut up ! Yeah . Not only the Professor ... but the whole country went crazy within a few years . Excuse me . I 'm getting off here . Please , let me off . With the arrival of foreigners , the population grew five times larger . A dollar dropped to 0.05 yen . " Stock Exchange " A gen dropped to 0.003 yen and a euro minus four yen . All the foreigners who used to live ... a rich life , suddenly became poor . With the increasing population , food supplies disappeared within weeks . Because Japan relied on imported foods , the prices went sky high . Give me riceball ! Give me riceball ! Leave me alone ! But still , movie stars from abroad were treated well . " The New Century Chushingura " Kira , here I come ! Not in the palace ! Be a samurai ! Not in the palace ! Come on , Kira ! " Women who Smoke is a Menace to Humankind ! " Okay , cut ! Good job . Jerry . Hi , Mr. Koga . That was an outstanding performance by an Oscar winner ! Thanks . Four fifths of the population in Japan are foreigners now . TV shows should star famous actors like you , for better ratings . You can count on me . I 've got something for your wife Elizabeth , too . Really ? Look . It 's a remake of a big hit TV show . All the producers had the same idea . They had actors from abroad star in their shows ... but against their expectations , they ended up with the lowest ratings . Why did this happen ? The foreigners who were expected to watch TV , didn 't have TV sets . Moreover , the Japanese viewers became tired of watching foreigners everyday . The Present , Year 2014 Fired ? What do you mean , fired ? I 'm the Oscar actor , Jerry Cruising . Fine . I 'll never be on your stupid show . You 'll regret it ! Elizabeth , please get the door . My fans are gonna murder you ! Our landlord 's here . Come on ... A dollar is worth 0.05 yen , so one of these would be 500 yen . That 's not enough . I 'll give you three minutes . Think it over . I won 't wait any longer ! Take it all . It 's still not enough . Liar ! I 'm not lying ! You listen up . I need 966 more of these . This 966 ! You 're crazy ! No money ! How can we get it ? No ! You crazy ! You go home ! Yellow monkey ! Hamburger prince ! I beg you , don 't walk out on me . What the hell is going on ? Oh , that yellow monkey , he said Japanese yen is ... What ? Our money doesn 't mean a thing in Japan ! Even in these conditions , some roles were left for foreign actors . Special-Effects Fantasy " Den Ace " Episode 563 " Beat the Monster ! " Once , I saw Jerry Cruising on a show where he was being chased by a monster . This special-effects fantasy became the talk of the country . The monsters keep stepping on foreigners . Repeatedly . Whenever Hajime Den feels good after a sip of beer ... Hajime Den he changes into the almighty " Den Ace " ! Den Ace is 53 meters tall , weighs 55 thousand tons ... and moves at Mach 20 . Our hero , " Den Ace " ! Den Ace would often ... fall down and squash the foreigners . " Den Ace " was a special show that lightened the stress of the Japanese ... who had become sick of foreigners . Whale meat is delicious . Here you are . Thanks . They 're quite cheap . Why ? Because nobody 's against whaling anymore . Whale meat was originally a Japanese delicacy . We 're free to eat them now . So the fact that the world sinks except Japan wasn 't so bad after all . There are so many weird foods at the supermarket . All kinds of animals from around the world . Leg of vultures and sea lions ... and meat of migratory birds you 've never heard of . They are edible , aren 't they ? I 'll check for things you might like . I 'd better improve my cooking . I 'm counting on you , honey Mr. Koga ? Elizabeth . Have mine , too . Thank you . You 're welcome . I 'm sorry about Jerry . You do understand the situation here in Japan . I don 't care how small it is . Please give me a role . What are you saying ? You 're Elizabeth Clift . Every movie fan 's dream . I can 't give you a small part with practically no lines . I 'm an actress . I can 't be anything else . Mr. Koga , please let me act ! You 're exactly the actress I fell in love with . Alright Elizabeth . I 'll be your manager . Really ? With that kind of determination , all of Japan will love you , too . Thank you , Mr. Koga . Another bad dream ? Sorry . You should go see a doctor . There are lots of people like me . You mean , foreigners . Not all foreigners were living miserably . English conversation schools all around Japan went out of business . Instead , a new school was made by an ex-TV personality . " Dave 's Japanese Conversation School " What do you think is the secret to your success ? Well ... Japan is an island country with an exclusive society . So all 400 million foreigners should master Japanese perfectly . We should try and aim for Rank A. Only then , will the Japanese treat you like human beings . Thanks to you all , business is flourishing . You seem happy . I went to see Dr. Namiki today . A doctor ? You mean ... I 'm three months pregnant . Wow ! We did it ! It was worth the effort . Cut it out . One more Japanese will come into this world . Aren 't you glad you 'll be born a Japanese ? That tickles . I 'll fix you a drink . Kyonan University Feels good . Wonderful . Alright now . It 's my turn to give you girls a massage ! Dirty old Professor . That 's a compliment . Um ... As you were saying ... Still here ? Where was I ? You were talking about the mantle . Oh yes . When energy builds up , it has to erupt at some point . The same goes with men and women , as well as the Earth . Is another mantle plume activity on the way ? Very soon . In the future . Which is it ? What could be 30 minutes global time ... could be 3 billion years microbiological time . Please answer my question . Why don 't you take a bite ? It 's ripe , huh ? Think of this peach as our Earth . The plate we 're standing on is merely the skin that covers the fruit . As simple as that . The skin will peel off ever so easily . To begin with , a skin never worries about what 's happening on the inside . Not unless you 're a doctor performing circumcision . What 's your point , Professor ? I 'm saying , there 's no need to worry . What we should do s enjoy life while we can ! You 're just fooling around . What will your wife say ? Listen . My wife and I haven 't had sex in a long long time . But soon after foreign men came flooding in ... she became a sex maniac ! What 's wrong with a short dick ? Nippon banzai ! That 's why I 'm having these blonde girls at my feet . As the costs of food went up , the prices of foreign women went down . Honey , I 'm only 10 yen . No thanks . I 'm not gonna pay 10 yen to catch some disease . Fuck you ! Short dick ! How much are you ? 3000 yen . 3000 ? Who 's gonna pay that much for a ... I 'll pay . Now for the foreigner forecast . Hello , this is Yoshizumi Morita . Many foreigners were out today , weren 't there ? At Sakomizu Temple in Kyoto , 86 carps worth 500 thousand yen each ... were turned into barbeques by homeless foreigners . The damage amounted to 43 million yen . People , please be careful of foreigners when you visit Kyoto . Also , at Hattori Shrine in Kitagawa Town ... an offertory box was robbed . After taking the money , the robbers burned the box to warm themselves . The homeless foreigners who did this were later arrested . According to the police , there are as many as 30 million foreigners ... staying in Japan illegally , and using the shrines and temples as lodgings . Isn 't it surprising to know that so much shrines and temples existed ? Be careful not to go near them . Tomorrow , there 's a chance of more foreigners coming in ... from the Pacific and the Sea of Japan . So please be sure to lock all doors and never go out alone . Look out for the East China Sea . They may come from the Sea of Okhotsk too , so take extra care . That 's all from me . We should ship them all out of the country . The Japanese should try sharing with foreigners than ... arresting them . They 'd steal from us anyway . Do you know how America became such a powerful country ? They accepted immigrants and gave them freedom and opportunity . But Japan is very small . No , your hearts are small . We 're just cautious . Darling , write an article that calls out to the readers . Ask the Japanese people to give foreigners more jobs . Actually , I was doing exactly that . Here . " At the old people 's home , war game is in fashion . " " This is a game where the elderly who 've experienced the Pacific War ... " " take the refugee foreigners for American soldiers ... " " and throw rotten eggs and tomatoes at them . " " Every time there 's a hit , the foreigners become hostages ... " " and the old people get to ride them like horses , all around the home . " " Having played this game , the elderly said they were happy that ... " " they had gotten even with Americans who bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki . " " The foreigners were also happy to have jobs . " " All the homes around Japan are showing interest in this game . " " It 's like killing two birds with one stone . " That 's horrible ! It 's helping the elderly as well as the foreigners . They 're human beings , too ! They 're hurt inside . Darling . You 've always said that the pen is mightier than the sword . There must be something else you could do for the foreigners . Alright then , we 'll hire some foreign maids . That 's not my point . I could do that for you . I 'm trying to help . They can stay at our house and eat our leftovers . They 're not stray animals ! You want to help them or not ? Make up your mind . You want foreign maids ? Well ... they make you look better . You 're just like the rest of them . I was only trying to help . That 's mine ! Give it to me ! Hey , boys ! If one of you take it , it 'll fill one tummy . But if you share it , it 'll fill both tummies . Share that orange peel , and I 'll give you this . Thank you , Mister ! You 're home . A Yummy Snack ! Sweetheart , share it with me . Please ? I 've worked hard for this Yummy Snack . My customer bought it for me . It 's mine . You 've slept with them . Short-dicked Japanese ! Why don 't you do the same and sleep with Japanese old women ? How could I ? I 'm ... I 'm a famous Oscar actor ! That 'll never fill my stomach . I 'll kill you , you slut ! You son of a bitch ! If not for me , you were nothing in Hollywood ! In order to stop these insane foreigners ... Yasuizumi took extralegal measures proposed by the Director-General ... and organized GAT . GAT stands for Gaigin ( foreigners ) Attack Team . They stop riots by foreigners and protect the lives of Japanese people . With the work of this team , the crime rate dropped . " Do not fish in this pond " Hey , stop ! A bill will be acted upon that will deport foreign refugees ... who have not adapted to Japan within the past three years . Prime Minister , take me to an expensive restaurant ! Shut up . By the way , I 've just gotten married ! Leave me alone . Break up GAT at once ! The world community would never approve of such a bill ! They 'd never forgive you . You talk about world community but your countries have all sunk . Your worlds have ended . All we have is Japan . The world is Japan ! Who needs the United Nations ? From now on , obey the rules of Japan . You 'd better adapt quickly or you 'll all be deported . " The Nippon Song " Nippon Nippon Hooray to Nippon Mount Fuji and beautiful cherry blossoms Temples of Kyoto and the heart of a Samurai We 've always been a cool nation from a long long time ago We love Nippon Banzai Nippon Our Nippon The Nippon Empire Nippon Nippon Hooray to Nippon Lights on a fishing boats and the music of crickets Delicious rice cakes and Japanese spirit We 've always had sensitive hearts from a long long time ago We love Nippon Banzai Nippon Our Nippon The Nippon Empire The Nippon Empire GAT gave out rice balls to foreigners . To foreigners who ratted on their peers . So much for friendship ! Many of them must have been innocent , but were still deported . There they are ! Get in ! The Japanese were now the most powerful people on Earth . I 'll be out delivering . I 'm not their slave . Phew ! So busy ! " I am Japanese " Hey Mister , they 're real geisha girls ! Do you know Japanese ? This place is for Japanese nasty old men . Get out of here . You 're Jerry Cruising , aren 't you ? So what ? Those people know that I 'm Jerry Cruising , they don 't even talk to me . Laugh , don 't you ? Why don 't you go ahead ? Laugh ! No . I don 't want to laugh you . I so know you 've came to Japan , but I don 't know it 's a place like this . Not exactly here because I ... I watched almost all you early movies . My early movies ? When I was a kid , my dad used to take me to see that " the revenge of the snail " ... Oh , it 's the dirtiest point of my career . You know , when I saw that movie , I became you fan . I was in love with you , you know ? You can say that Jerry Cruising was my first love . Well , you must be a very rare kid . Yeah , When it was played , I beg my dad to take me to see it over and over again . He took me like 3 times . He was so tired of that , you know , he was saying like , " What 's so great about this movie ? " You know after that two weeks , I want to see it more . If you did , the dad 's brain may be spilling off ... You two , speak Japanese . A wife of a Japanese . So , you are a ... I 'm Catherine . You 're Catherine , Japanese housewife . We 're different social class , we are . But your eyes are here for ... Of course , I 'm Amercan . No . You 're Japanese , The food you eat is different . Yes , you can have this . Come on baby , don 't play with me . No , please believe me . You can have this . Take this . Really ? What about your husband ? Will he get mad ? No . Don 't worry , he 's OK . You know , it 's for your " revenge " movie . Alright , thanks , Catherine . I 'll share with my friends . You 're welcome . Bye . Jerry , can I be honest with you ? Yes , sure . I like you best before you go to Oscar . When you become big , you got to be a little bit boring . But you know , your eyes are alive again . I 'm hungry again . Maybe . Bye . I 'm home . Welcome home , Master . Bathroom . Number one or number two ? Number one . Where 's dinner ? Madam didn 't go shopping . So we couldn 't cook . No leftovers for us . Help us , Master ... You didn 't go shopping ? Sorry , I ate out . Order yourself some pizza . The maids would be happy . I 've already had pizza for lunch . Why didn 't you ask the maids to go shopping ? I like to pick out my own food . Where 's my freedom ? It 's been a while since I saw you do your face . Are you competing with those maids to get my attention ? You 're so stupid . What 's that tone ? You have time for facials but no time to go shopping ? Don 't nag at me ! Alright . I 'm going . With that face ? I 'm going . Alright , I 'll order something . I 'm going anyway ! What 's wrong with you ? Can 't you be more obedient ? You should be thankful that you 're married to a Japanese ! Shut up ! I 'm American ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Hey ... Wait , will you ? Going out ? I 'm leaving . You can have all my clothes . No , you can 't ! That was how my wife , Catherine left me . A picture book ? I 'm reading it to my baby . Isn 't it a little too soon ? What 's it about ? " Once upon a time , there lived a mouse inside a mitten . " " One day , a frog came along and they shared the mitten . " " Then came a rabbit , a fox , a wolf , and a wild boar ... " " until finally , a bear joined in ... " " and the mitten swelled up . " But it 's impossible to live inside something as small . That 's the fun of it . Besides , the bear and the wolf would eat the others up . But they all live happily ever after inside the mitten . The Yasuki dance ... That 's all he ever does . But never mind . Remember the girl in the movie , " Stevie 's Angels " ? Ever since I saw her dance , I 've fantasized about her . She 's now a porn star . Watch her movie . I came seven times . Wow . Alright then . Let 's watch it with my maids tonight . Better not . Foreign women will suck the life out of you . Dry as a mummy . What did I miss ? Hollywood actresses in dirty movies . Oh . Don 't you watch them with your wife ? We don 't do that kind of stuff . Which actress are you talking about ? Sophie Kristel , Olivia Cotton ... Susan Percy ... and Joanna O 'Neal . Talking of Hollywood actresses , what about Elizabeth Clift ? Haven 't seen her yet . You haven 't ? Actually , she once came to me asking for a job . I went to visit her yesterday , but they told me she 'd already moved . I slept with Elizabeth the other day . She got so excited when I gave her a Yummy Snack , you know what I mean ? Hey , weren 't you her fan ? Sorry . Forget I ever said that . How was she ? She may be a first-class actress but was second-class in bed . She 'd never take you seriously ! You wanted to share her with Jerry ? Just because she 's left him ... 10 days after Catherine left ... I came across her quite unexpectedly . I said I 'm paying for it ! Catherine , go home . Let her go . She 's my wife ! What happened ? I 'm the leader of GAT leader . This foreigner was caught stealing a Yummy Snack . Oscar Award winner , Jerry Cruising was caught shoplifting a Yummy Snack . A single Yummy Snack was now 100 thousand yen . I had no idea how Catherine met Jerry . She was begging the leader for Jerry 's release in exchange for money . You ask him . How much for his release ? Foreigners aren 't allowed to be bailed out . He 's to be deported instantly . But I 'm asking you . I 'm Japanese . We have orders from the top leader . You 're all crazy ! He 's the award winning actor , Jerry Cruising . Haven 't you seen his movies ? How could you do such a thing to him ? He 's a criminal nevertheless . Make an exception . No way . Stupid bureaucrats ! You know what ? I could get you arrested for insulting me ! Let 's go home for now . My sub-editor may know some way to help Jerry . I 'm going with him . Are you serious ? If you can help Jerry , you can help me , too . I 'll join him . A voluntary departure ? Fine . Hey , you can 't do that . Catherine , you 're married to me . Come back home . I 'd rather be deported than to go back to you ! Still angry at me ? No ... it 's the maids . I 'll fire them , so come home with me . I love Jerry . I 've chosen Jerry , not you . Catherine ... You 'll die ! Even if you 're lucky enough to reach Tibet or Pairs ... you 'll be raped by savages ! What 's the difference , if I stayed here in Japan ? Don 't go , Catherine . No , you 're coming with me . Mister ... Come back ! Mister . I 'm starting to wonder which one of us is getting deported . Mister . If you still love Catherine at all , if you truly love her ... you must let her do as she pleases . Catherine , I wish you have this . Baby , you make me so happy . Thank you . Here you are ! The extra spin ! Oh , what fun ! Excellent . Stand up . Move . I knew it . You 're ... Too late ! Thank you very much for bullying my country , Mr. President . Listen , ignorant people . As of now , this island is mine ! We 're in big trouble . Japan will never give in to terrorism . You 'll be our hostages for now . Until all of Japan is at my feet . GAT will stop you . GAT is working for me now . What ? We 've picked up 13 homeless foreigners . The search at Asahikawa Zoo went smoothly today ... and we 're expecting to find approximately 300 more . Excuse me . Nice work . Freeze ! Put your hands behind your backs . Mr. Ishiyama . As of now , you will be our hostage . By now , our General Secretary should have Yasuizumi by the neck . You ! I said , hands behind your back ! I 've made this special bomb , Spiner Z for such an occasion . With a push of this button , the whole building will blow to pieces . You can 't fool me . I know it 's a fake . Find out for yourselves . I 've worked hard to serve and protect my country . I 've done so ... because I love the beautiful nature and culture of Japan . Japan ... Japan is forever ours . We 'll never let the foreigners touch us . Who gives a damn about the Continent of China My guts will spill out but I 'll pretend it 's pneumonia Hooray to our General Secretary Kim ! Hooray , hooray ... Tadokoro ! My friends . Before long , Japan will sink . Do not fuss . The Earth along with mankind have come to an end . I 've discovered a connection between the air mass and the convection current . It seems that Japan will be on top of China only temporarily . Merely a one-time transitional phenomenon . Drink and have fun while it lasts ... and remember to take a leak in between . The mantle 's layers under the Pacific are changing rapidly ... which means that the pressure from the Pacific is low . Then what happens ? The continent will start tilting toward the Pacific . However , Japan is on top of this continent . So naturally , the island of Japan will tilt over with the continent ... and sink into the Pacific . Won 't we float back ? Fool . Not a chance . We 're like a seesaw . Or a swing . Exactly . From the beginning , land on Earth has ... always been like seesaws and swings . Humans living on this unstable planet ... are just insecure beings , always running out of time . That 's all folks . Good bye ... Professor ! We 're trapped ! There ! Professor ... We must escape . Don 't move ! It 's all your fault ! We 're dying anyway ! You stuck up old bastard ! Let me go ! Truce , everyone ! Someone have a light ? Here 's a flashlight . Shit , the battery 's gone . Wait , I thought I saw a candle somewhere . Beautiful . This could be the last light we 'll see . Did something hit my head ? What 's happened ? Hey , what are you all doing ? There was an earthquake . An earthquake occurred and something fell on your head . It 's all the earthquake 's fault . Yes . This world was born with earthquakes and will disappear with them . This is the end of humanity . However ... the end could be a beginning of another story . Akiko ... " Once upon a time , there lived a mouse inside a mitten . " " One day , a frog came along and they shared the mitten . " " Then came a rabbit , a fox , a wolf , and a wild boar ... " " until finally , a bear joined in and the mitten swelled up . " Just as the world was about to end , there came a moment of peace .

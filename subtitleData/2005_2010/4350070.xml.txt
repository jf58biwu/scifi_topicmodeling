Somebody , please ! Demetri ! Demetri ! - [ Screaming continues ] - [ Alarms blaring ] [ Woman ] Good morning , Los Angeles . It 's 7 : 00 and it looks like it 's gonna be another beautiful day . We 're looking at light clouds and highs in the mid-70 's today . But keep that umbrella handy ' cause we got a chance of sprinkles later in ... [ beeping ] [ Chuckles ] I hate you , too . Hmm . Mm . Oh , babe , don 't forget to look at the garage door . It 's acting up again . Already forgotten . Bye . [ Voice on TV ] I hate acorns . Just because I 'm a squirrel doesn 't mean I like acorns . [ Man ] Mmm . Smells good . Here you go , my princess . [ Smooches ] [ Gears grinding ] - [ Banging ] - [ Man grunts ] - [ Speaks Spanish ] - [ Chuckles ] - Hey , Hector . - [ Hector speaks Spanish ] [ # Miss Eighty6 : Goodie Bag playing ] Hey , Nicole . - I 'm sorry I 'm late . - [ Man ] Don 't worry . Hey , Olivia 's working the late shift at the hospital tonight . You think you could stay an extra hour or two ? Yeah , no problem . - I 've got studying to do , anyway . - [ Man ] You 're a saint . [ Man on phone ] Hey , this is Bryce . You know what to do . - [ Beep ] - Bryce , it 's Olivia . You weren 't at rounds yesterday . You better have a damn good reason why . OK , you call me immediately . I 'm worried about you . [ People chattering ] [ Man ] My daughter Tracy was five-five , 118 pounds . But when the Marines shipped her body back from Afghanistan ... Sorry , her remains they weighed 37 . Only reason I knew it was her at all was because they 'd DNA 'd what was left . So ... Yeah I took a drink that night . You call Amanda yet ? - Yeah , we 're talking . - You 're talking , really ? That 's kind of weird because she told Olivia she never heard from you . Hey , I 'm your sponsor . I 'm the one supposed to be riding you . Not the other way around . - All right , I 'm getting around to it . - Come on , Aaron , just call . She 's cool . Nurses freak me out , man . It 's a date . She 's not giving you a friggin ' enema . How do you know that 's not my thing ? [ # Mos Def : Quiet Dog ] [ Moaning ] - What 's wrong ? - I thought I heard Charlie . - Charlie 's asleep . - This is so wrong . [ Chuckling ] Which is why you love it . Dude , as soon as we 're done , you have to get your ass out of here . All right , well , stop talking and get to work . [ Camera shutter clicks ] [ Man ] So then we get to the subject of the first dance , right ? I 'm sorry , but Zoey picks one of the corniest songs of all time . Islands in the Stream . Yeah , the old Kenny Rogers , Dolly Parton duet . OK , and we used to sing it when we did karaoke . But that was when we were like , really , really drunk , you know ? And I put up with it because we were dating and that 's what you do . But my friends are gonna be there , my family . I cannot dance to Islands in the Stream . I will never live it down . You don 't care about any of this , do you ? No , I do . I do care . I 'm riveted . I 'm fascinated . [ Hums music ] But , uh , what do you want me to say , don 't marry her ? Don 't marry her . The odds are against you , anyway . Well , that 's great . Thank you . You 're still married . Surprised Olivia didn 't leave me a long time ago . Me too , buddy . So what 'd you guys dance to ? Can 't even remember . [ Quiet Dog continues playing ] He 's a holy terror . Terrible twos at one year . [ Chuckles ] You 're lucky you have a girl . [ Scoffs ] Are you kidding me ? You only have to worry about one penis . - I gotta worry about all of them . - [ Laughs ] Here we go . Showtime . Khalid , Omar , unknown female going mobile in a black SUV . Bobby ...

It 's finally about to start getting interesting . Hey , Mark , I 'm putting you on speaker . What do you got ? Khalid , Omar and an unidentified Caucasian woman . We 're emailing you pictures right now . Who is she ? Uh , that 's the " unidentified " part , sweetheart . Get this to digital forensics and run it by ICE . OK .

[ Man 2 ] Can 't go this way ! Have to circle around ! - Hands up ! Hands up ! - [ Mark ] Don 't move ! I got it . Get out . Come on . Get out . Get out ! We know you were planning an attack . What did you do , huh ? [ Woman grunting ] - Tell me what happened ! - Take it easy . We know about the suitcase . Did you set it off ? Answer me ! I blacked out . I was somewhere else . There was a storm . The horses were scared . What are you talking about ? What are you talking about ? - What are you ... - Calm down ! Does this look like a dirty bomb to you ? We don 't know what this is . - Maybe they weren 't even involved . - Are you guys cops ? FBI . It 's OK . - What happened ? - [ Woman ] A nuclear attack ? - I don 't know . - Gotta be The Big One . Look ! Look at this mess . Gotta be . - When 's help getting here ? - [ Man ] It was terrorists ! Until emergency services arrives , we need to stay calm and help whoever we can , alright ? - They ain 't coming . - What ? - [ Demetri ] What 'd you say ? - I just heard on my radio , some guy in San Diego . They 're dealing with the same thing . This is more than just LA , man . [ Demetri ] Sit down . You move , I shoot . [ Phone beeping ] I can 't get through to Zoey . What about Olivia ? - No . - Listen , Zoey 's in Seattle right now . But Olivia 's close by , right ? Hospital 's two miles . You can make it on foot . No , no , I can 't just leave . Listen , there 's nothing we can do here right now . OK ? Go check on your family . Go ! - [ Screaming ] - [ Alarm ringing ] [ Shouting ] [ Man ] Look out ! Move ! - [ Screaming ] - [ Crashing ] - [ Tires screeching ] - Look out ! Look out , man . Hey ! Son of a ! [ Indistinct radio chatter ] [ Man speaking foreign language on TV ] [ Man on TV ] All cellular systems are incapacitated . [ Overlapping chatter on TV ] [ Woman on TV ] There are thousands and thousands of injured people ... [ woman 2 ] Uh , all we know for certain is that everyone on the planet seemed to have blacked out at exactly the same time . [ Man 2 ] ... confirming that the blackout was a worldwide phenomenon . [ Woman 3 ] ... of the blackout is unknown . [ Woman 4 ] Uh , fire services and police services are completely overwhelmed at this time . My God , it 's the whole world . [ Woman 5 ] ... no information as to the cause of the blackout . - [ woman ] Hospitals are overflowing . - [ Phone ringing ] Uh , the fire services and the police services are completely overwhelmed . Livy ! Livy , I 'm here ! - Oh , thank God I got a hold of you . - What about Charlie ? Is she OK ? She 's fine . Nicole called . She can stay put till one of us gets home . - And you 're all right . - [ Olivia ] Yeah , I 'm fine . We were in the middle of surgery and we all lost consciousness . Everyone . The patient died while we were out . I 'm downtown right now , same thing . So , w-what , everyone there blacked out ? Yeah , everyone . We thought it was just the hospital , but then Corrie got a call from her mother in Chicago . Same thing happened there . I know . It looks like this thing was global . Global ? It 's impossible . Oh , I love you , but , babe , I gotta go . All right . I love you ... Livy ? - What do you got ? - Eight-year-old boy , ped versus car . Plowed straight through a fence at a school . Head injury , abdominal bruising ... - Doctor Benford ! - Where the hell have you been ? Go get into your scrubs , meet me in ER . OK , let 's get him into Trauma . You 're gonna be OK , honey . - I know , Olivia . - How did you know my name ? [ Mark ] What 've we heard from Washington ? The same . Everyone 's gathering intel . CIA , Homeland Security , our various Legats offices overseas ... In other words , nobody knows anything . - [ Olivia ] How 's he doing ? - He 's taken a turn for the worse . I got no breath sounds on the left . Possible punctured lung . He needs a left chest tube stat . If we don 't release the pressure soon , - it 's gonna stop his heart . - He 's going south , sats are dropping ... [ Mark ] What the hell is this ? Worldwide phenomenon ? - Near as we can tell . - People from all corners losing consciousness at exactly the same moment . And for the same duration . Two minutes , 17 seconds . How is that even possible ? Where the hell is that chest tube tray ? - I need it now ! - [ Woman ] Right away ! - Got no pulse . Blood pressure 's 40 . - Thoracotomy . - What are we gonna do ? - Come on , sweetie . Hang in there . [ Bryce ] Pulse ox 90 . - All right . - [ Bryce ] Pulse ox 80 . - We 're dropping , we 're losing him ! - How 're we doing ? [ Bryce ] No pulse . No pulse . Blood pressure 's dropping . So we 've eliminated nuclear launches , EMPs and chemical agents . What about natural phenomena , then ? NASA 's checking into more exotic explanations , solar flares , gamma bursts , that kind of thing . But so far , they 've come up empty . What about the Vatican ? Has the pope chimed in yet ? [ Olivia ] Let 's get this chest tube in . Sats improving . BP 's normalizing . And the pleurovac . Doing great , buddy . Doing real good . OK . Let 's get him into the CT scanner , check out that head injury . Bryce , you close him up . Nice job , but don 't think you 're off the hook . I still want to know where you were yesterday . [ Woman ] Yeah , clean that up . We need to wrap our heads around the scope of this thing , people . It 's now been four hours since the blackout . You shut off the consciousness of the entire human race for two minutes , what would the death toll be ? How many cars collided ? We have planes down at LAX . How many more across the country ? Around the world ? FAA 's reporting 877 aircraft down in the United States alone . Air Force Two was one of them . The veep was on board . OK . What about hospitals ? Operations ? Births that were in process , people probably died walking up a flight of stairs . [ Indistinct whispering ] [ Man ] Global projections are pretty staggering . What about the blackouts themselves , sir ? What about them ? Well , we 've been saying people have been blacking out , but that wasn 't my experience . For me , it was more like a dream . Only more vivid than that . One second I was in a car the next I was somewhere else . - Same thing happened to me . Me too . During the blackout , people seem to have experienced some kind of hallucination . No , no , no . Except that mine didn 't feel like a hallucination . - What 's your point , Benford ? - I didn 't just lose consciousness . It felt more like my consciousness went somewhere else . Like I was having a memory . Only it , it wasn 't of the past . It was of the future . I was in my office . It was night . It was 10 : 00 , on the hour . I was looking out into the atrium . And I happened to see the date . April 29th , 2010 . - About half a year from now . - Hold on . April 29th ? I saw the same date . It was on the news . - Same for me . April 29th , 10 : 00pm . - [ Man ] Twenty-ninth ... - So you 're saying what ? - [ Man ] You too ? Everyone 's consciousness just jumped forward six months to April 29th ? Crazy as that sounds , yeah . [ Indistinct chatter ] Sit down . Sit down ! J.T. , could you , uh , give me a hand ? Thanks . We didn 't do this . Even if you didn 't , you were still planning on killing thousands of people , so stay still and shut up . - Hey . - Hey . You get a hold of Zoey ? - Yeah , she 's all right , thank ... - Mark , hey , you got a sec ? Sure . I think there may be a way to corroborate what we were talking about in there . - What do you mean ? - Well , in my flash forward , it was April 30th , 6 : 00am . But I was in London , which is eight hours ahead of the West Coast , so it makes sense . Wait . Flash forward ? What are we talking about here ? I 'll explain later . Tell me what you saw . I was having a meeting with our liaison at New Scotland Yard . I remember we were interrupted because this bird just crashed into the window . The point is , I had a vision of Fiona Banks . Let 's see if she had a vision of me . - Inspector Banks . - Fiona . This is Al Gough , FBI . I 'm here with my colleagues in LA . My God . Al , I know why you 're calling . - You want to know what I saw ? - We all do . [ Fiona on phone ] OK . Um , we were sitting in my office . - What was the date ? - April 30th . - What time ? - I don 't know , uh , 6 : 00 in the morning . [ Fiona ] Don 't ask me why it was so early . Something to do with the Rutherford Case . Yes , yes ! - And , and something interrupted us . - [ Fiona ] Yes , uh , uh , a bird . It flew at the window . It broke its neck . So our visions were the same . When the worldwide blackout occurred earlier today , people were undergoing brain scans at that exact moment . [ Man ] So , like , MRIs or PET scans , that kind of thing ? [ Man 2 ] Exactly . And in each of these cases , the hippocampus , that 's the memory center of the brain , was actively engaged for the entire two minutes and 17 seconds . These thought patterns are consistent with a waking experience . People were not asleep . They were not dreaming . So then what is it that they were experiencing ? [ Man 2 ] Well , by all appearances , uh , memories of events that haven 't occurred yet . So everyone saw the future . But did they see the same future ? - I mean , are these accounts consistent ? - [ man ] They certainly seem to be . Hundreds of thousands of people were watching news broadcasts , reading newspapers , and their details seem to be the same . Senator Glenway will be facing ethics charges . The Dow will be on an upswing . There 'll be food riots in Ghana . And the list goes on . [ Man 3 ] A remarkably concise series of events are starting to come together from that day . It 's like a grand mosaic is being filled in . And everyone on Earth has a piece ... Mosaic . That was the name of the investigation I was working on in my vision . It had to do with what caused all this . So , did you see anything in your vision that was helpful ? Photographs , names , people of interest . If this really was the future we all saw , then I guess maybe they will be leads . But none of them make any sense to me right now . - Anything else ? - No , no . That , that was it . What about you ? What did you see ? Nothing . I , uh , I blacked out like everybody else , and woke up on the road . What about our , uh , person of interest ? Do we think she 's involved ? [ Mark ] She 's a dead-end if you ask me . And clueless as the rest of us . We 'll circle back on it , anyway . We 're grasping at straws at this point . Janis , you wanna share what you saw ? Yeah , I was getting a prenatal sonogram . The baby was about 17 weeks and it was a little girl . It was totally bizarre . But I 'm obviously not pregnant . I don 't even have a boyfriend . What about you , sir ? I ... was in a meeting . A meeting . [ Whistling tune ] And I happened to glance down at the paper . Sports page . The Rays rallied from three runs down to sweep the Sox at Fenway . And there was another story : Kobe Bryant tore his ligament in his knee . - Out for the season . - [ Flushing ] You know what ? We should start writing these stories down . I mean , the Post has a circulation of what , a million ? - Million , yeah . - How many other people were reading it then , too ? We gotta start comparing stories . And it 's not just the Post . It 's all the other news outlets . Seven billion people caught a glimpse of the future . Maybe just one of them knows why this happened . How do we compare seven billion stories ? - You create a website . - [ Wedeck ] Right . People can log on and post what they saw and cross-reference their visions . We can piggyback on that and search for patterns . I think that 's what I was already doing . - What do you mean ? - [ Mark ] Mosaic . All those leads I was running down . We should start following up on them now . Assuming your vision is even accurate , the investigation doesn 't exist yet . But it could . It will . In my flash forward , I was investigating what caused all this . I seemed to have an idea why all of this was happening , and those people , the places I saw on the board , they were part of this puzzle . Mosaic . Look , I 'm certain of it . Fine . We 'll set up an interagency task force . And as far as this office is concerned , you three , you own this . This is kind of insane . I mean , we 're running point on this because he had a vision of us running point on this ? [ Mark ] You find that funny ? Come on , it 's the only lead we have . We don 't have anything right now . - [ Demetri ] Don 't know if it happened ! - It works for me . The whole world 's on pins and needles , people . Air traffic 's been grounded . People scared to leave their homes , walk across the street . Hell , we 've got martial law across half this country . Priority number one : Finding out what caused this . Priority number two is figuring out whether or not it 'll happen again . You got it ? [ All ] Yes , sir . Good . I 'm out . OK , my psychic friend , what do you got ? I remember a name : D. Gibbons . - [ Demetri ] Gibbons ? - [ Mark ] That 's right . Yeah . [ Demetri ] What else you got ? There was a photograph here of a doll . The doll was burned , the head was melted . There was , uh , a bullet casing nearby . Something about Baltimore , a hand . Baltimore ... no , no , no , wait , wait , wait , wait , uh , a blue hand . - That 's what it said . - [ Demetri ] Hell does that mean ? I have no idea . Just put it up . No , no , no . Wait , wait , wait . Here in the center . This is gonna sound stupid , but I was wearing one of those , uh , friendship bracelets . You know , like kids make . Yeah . OK , that 's good . What else ? - What else ? - [ Mark ] That 's it . Those are all the leads I can remember . What about your state of mind ? What were you doing ? [ Sighs ] I was chambering a round . I was scared to death . - You were scared to death in here ? - Yeah . The office was empty , but someone was coming for me . They were wearing masks . They wanted to kill me because of what I knew . One of them had a tattoo . How many D. Gibbons do you think there are in the world ? - [ Demetri ] Maybe thousands . - Have Janis compile the list . [ Sighs ] Not a hell of a lot to go on yet . At least you remember something . What do you mean ? Everybody saw something . Everybody had some kind of a vision . I didn 't see a damn thing , Mark . Maybe it means you 'll be sleeping six months from now . If I was sleeping , why wasn 't I dreaming ? Look , uh , I never remember my dreams . Just stop , all right ? We 're both thinking the same thing , so let 's just say it . What if I didn 't see anything because six months from now I 'm gonna be dead ? [ Crickets chirping ] Mr. Benford ? Are you all right ? Yeah . How 's Charlie ? She 's fine . She 's sleeping . I was watching the news all day . They say it happened everywhere . It 's gonna be OK . Is that what they 're saying at the FBI ? Do you have inside information ? I wish we did . So then you don 't know it 's gonna be OK . I think God did this . Why ? To punish us . [ Olivia ] Still no luck finding his parents ? Well , his mother died on the 405 . Father 's name is Lloyd Simcoe . He works at Stanford . But , uh , no one 's been able to locate him yet . God . So even if the kid pulls through , he could still wind up an orphan . Hey , you saved his life today . You chalk that up as a victory . Yeah , I 'm trying , but after a day like today ... What about you ? How are you staying so Zen through all this ? Who says I am ? You wanna know why I wasn 't at work yesterday ? Mm-hmm . I 've been going through some really heavy things recently . I don 't want to get into it now . But the , the point is , this morning I was out on the Venice Pier , and and I was thinking about committing suicide . - Oh , my God ... - It 's OK . I 'm , I 'm OK . I saw a glimpse of my future and I was alive . You know , and everything 's changed for me now . Whatever I was thinking about doing obviously wasn 't meant to happen . It 's like a sign from God or something . You know , these visions were a gift , don 't you think ? A gift ? I don 't know . - Not for me . - Why ? What , what did you see ? I saw the end of my marriage . [ Mark ] I was drinking again . In my flash forward . And in my head , I , I knew it wasn 't just a one-time thing . I was full-fledged drinking again . All the anxiety , the shame , it was all back . Just because you saw that , doesn 't mean it 's gonna happen . Even if this future stuff is real maybe it 's a blessing in disguise . Maybe because you saw it , you can change it . Ghost of Christmas Future crap . What if I can 't ? People relapse . I did . You pick yourself up again . Olivia said she 'd , she 'd leave me if I slip again . She made that clear . Then don 't slip . Until you see something that corroborates these visions it it 's all fantasy . Future 's still up in the air . You 're a terrible sponsor , you know that ? What do you want me to say , Mark ? You 're not the only one this , this has happened to , you know . I 've got the opposite problem . What do you mean ? Tracy was killed in Afghanistan , and you were at the funeral , right ? Right . But in my flash forward she 's alive . [ Mark ] Doesn 't make any sense . They ID 'd her remains . I know . I can 't explain it . But it was her . I 'm , I 'm certain of it . And if she 's out there somewhere , she needs me . For two years I 've , I 've been putting her to rest , now ... I don 't know what to think . I 'm , I 'm confused . I 'm ... I 'm hopeful . And I 'm angry that I 'm hopeful . You 're worried ... your future 's gonna come true . I 'm worried mine won 't . [ # Mojave 3 : All Your Tears ] - You fixed the garage door . - It was a slow day . [ Mark ] Do you remember our song ? The one we danced to at our wedding ? Etta James , At Last . [ Chuckles ] Right . What did you see ? [ Sighs ] I was at the office , working on a case . It was , it was this . What caused the flash forward . Got the sense I was in danger . Then then it ended . Nothing else ? No . That was it . What about you ? Babe ? I don 't want to talk about it . Why ? 'Cause it was too upsetting . I need to hear it , whatever it was . No . No , you don 't . Come on . What did you see ? You know what , Mark , just let it go . Olivia . What did you see ? [ Gasps ] I was with another man . Who ? I don 't know . I 've never seen him before . He was downstairs . I don 't know who he was . And yet , in my vision , I had all these intense feelings for him , I ... Hey , honey . I don 't understand , Mark . I would never cheat on you . I wouldn 't betray you , I wouldn 't . I ... Just because we saw these things doesn 't mean they 're gonna happen . - Dylan . - Uh , I 'm sorry , you are ? His father , Lloyd Simcoe . - How is he ? - [ Bryce ] He 'll be fine . His attending physician , Dr. Benford , will be here in the morning . She can fill you in on some of the details . Then I 'll wait for her . [ Girl ] Daddy ? What are you doing up , sweetie ? It 's after midnight . I had a bad dream . Come here . You wanna talk about it ? - Why was Mommy crying ? - Oh , she was just scared . - It 's gonna be OK . - Are you scared ? No , honey . I 'm fine . What do you have there ? What do you got in your hand ? Hmm ? Something I made for you . I want you to have it . Take it , Daddy . Do you want me to help you put it on ? Sure . OK . There you go . [ Demetri ] I 'm still at work , babe . Mm , they got us working late . Yeah . I 'm watching it right now . [ # Dolly Parton Kenny Rogers : Islands in the Stream ] Lf , uh , this is the song you want , you got it , baby . [ Chuckles ] Let 's , um , let 's talk about the future when you get home . Dem , come here . You have to see this . Gotta go . I love you , too . What 's up ? OK , so as far as we know , every single person on the entire planet lost consciousness at the exact same period of time , right ? - Right . - OK . So I started cycling through a bunch of surveillance cameras for the last five hours because I was curious to see what they recorded . I looked at hundreds of them . I checked every major city , even webcams in other countries , and they all show the exact same thing . At 11 : 00am people start dropping like flies . OK ? And then two minutes and 17 seconds later , they start to come to . And then I saw this . This was in Detroit . - [ Demetri ] What am I looking at ? - Just hang on . Right there . Look right there . - No way . - Yeah . Who the hell is that ? And why are they awake ?

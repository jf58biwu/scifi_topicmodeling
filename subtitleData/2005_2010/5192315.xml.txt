It 's a good-luck charm . The eyes of the world were on Uddiyana today as the cease-fire ... Uddiyana 's capital . ... the ceremony was held during Uddiyana 's traditional Kufura Jayanti festival ... the Kufura . peace had come to Uddiyana . But there was no sign of Shirasu there that day . It was about a week afterwards that I finally managed to get in touch with Shirasu . Here ! Right here ! Right in front of you . you 're looking a lot better than I expected . Senpai ? You bet . I even lost 5 kilos . No way . What can I get you ? - Hm ... Butter tea . - Coffee . What the hell ? Shirasu had been taken into custody by the UNF . It was five days after that that Shirasu was informed that she would not be returning to the SDC . These are the personal effects that were sent from the frontline base . Is this everything ? Yes . Also ... We will be keeping all of the material that you shot . It might contain certain material that would prove inconvenient to the UN . ... so there is no cause for concern . I suppose not . I was asked by Lt. Chris to give this to you personally . Um ... Does this mean that I won 't be able to see any of those people again ? No . Never . Shirasu was released . This is the hotel I stayed at when I first I came to Subasci . It still smells as musty as it did back then . this is what it 's like to be back at square one ? That month I spent ... What was it all for ? Lt. Chris ... You dropped your good-luck charm in the helicopter . hasn 't it ? Is that all ? Frayed ? It doesn 't look very ... A memory card ! Lt. Beroqui ! Hey ! Lt. Beroqui . ... it means that this memory card has been safely delivered to you . I guess you 're surprised that things have turned out this way . This is a copy I made of your card before it was confiscated . It contains all of the footage that you shot . Miss Shirasu . It is your property . ... photos that you risked your life for and poured your soul into . not even the UN . They are proof that you lived life to the fullest in the time you spent with us . Beroqui ! What 's the holdup ? Quick ! Come here ! Everything is ready ! I 'm gonna throw a shot I took of you from your best angle as a special bonus ... grow up ! - Lunch break is almost over ! Line up ! Line up ! now ! Shirasu ! Take care ! Keep taking your wonderful pictures ! And watch out for strange men ! Lieutenant . Don 't start binge eating ! And brush your teeth ! 304 ) } I 'll 304 ) } I 'll ne ever fo 428 ) } T 428 ) } Thank 428 ) } Than 428 ) } Tha 428 ) } T 424 ) } T 424 ) } Thank you so I ... I 'll do my best . Guess I shouldn 't have hung around and waited for things to settle down after the ceremony was over . what are your plans now ? I thought I 'd stick around for a while . There are lots of shots that I want to get . but you should still be careful . The insurgent attacks haven 't completely stopped yet . there was ... Hey ! Are you listening to me ? Hello ? Hello ? Sis ? Takashi ? I hear you called a while ago ? You 'll be able to come home soon ? Yeah . How are things back home ? right ? okay ? He won 't let up about it . I remember . I 'll see you then . that 's the day after tomorrow ! you 're leaving already ? there 's lots of places where people are shooting at each other . huh ? we 'll run into each other again . you 're still here ? Sorry to disappoint you . it 's been a week since the signing ceremony . don 't you ? too . big guy ? I don 't really know . Details on the UNF headquarters takeover and the whole Pou situation are still fuzzy . It 's hard to imagine things staying as-is . then ? I 'm staying . I hear you 're leaving tomorrow ? Yeah . It 's gonna be awfully quiet around here ... Big guy ! You have a visitor ! you know that ? peace has finally returned to my country . I always had faith that this day would eventually come . Unadulterated faith and love ... ... " There probably isn 't a power on Earth that can hold those two things back . I was scared when it occurred to me that tomorrow also implied there would be a different future . But I want to believe that there are ten million kufuras in the world . I know you 're one of them . Is that ... the airport ? This can 't be happening ... It isn 't right . Keiichi ? but I 'm going back to Tokyo . ... but I 've been running around like crazy trying to get on a flight . Sorry . I 'll leave this for you at the front desk . ... there was one picture that really captivated me . It 's stayed in my mind ever since . I figured it out . isn 't it ? A prayer directed at tomorrow . A prayer expressing belief in tomorrow . Life and death always go hand in hand here ... It came as a shock because I 'd never seen so many deaths before . I 'm alive ! But I met even more prayers than deaths . and ... but it 's like the light of hope inside you never goes out . I think that prayer is an act of courage . I believe in tomorrow ! I guess it 's just like the significance that the Flag carries . I finally realized what sort of pictures I wanted to take after I got to know this country . After I got to know the people of the SDC unit . Akagi-senpai . Thank you so much . ... I think I finally understand what you 've been telling me all these years . it becomes the past . ... believing in the future that will come next . I guess we do . there are tons of pictures that I want to take now . I 'll be heading back to Tokyo ahead of you . Keiichi . Lisa ? would you mind taking a picture of us ? Of course . say cheese . three months ? Keiichi . Then you shouldn 't have taken pictures of me . What do you suppose it was ? What was ? The UNF 's goal . but they confiscated the pictures . ... and never disclosed that the Flag had been stolen in the first place . it was probably a reinforcement plan meant to boost the Flag 's value . maybe it was more like an insurance policy . they probably hoped to create a new legend using the photographer who took the Flag picture . ... and that there were some surprising players operating behind the scenes . they tried to pretend the whole thing never happened . They determined that was the best way to move the roadmap forward . The powers that be did it on a whim . On a whim ? ... the story probably would have taken a different turn . Keiichi ! none of this would have happened ... I hear that you 're editing the footage and pictures she left for you . It 's unfinished business I need to see to . Will you release them ? I don 't care about that anymore . I 'm just looking for closure . I 'd love to see them . you will . I promise . I 'm off . - Leaving so soon ? I 'm going back to Uddiyana on the first flight tomorrow . Wait a minute ... That country is just getting started . They have a lot to work through . What I can do is keep watching and keep taking pictures . too . ... and I have my own things that I have to do . Shirasu ! We bore witness to a conflict in a far-off country . a single picture will bring peace back . And that 's what yours did . There are ten million kufuras in the world . And if all those kufuras raise up the Flag at once in the hope of peace ... Shirasu . That 's why people like us keep taking pictures . right ? okay ? He won 't let up about it . I remember . I 'll see you then . 390 ) } Ju _ 390 ) } Jun 390 ) } June 2 _ 390 ) } June 28 _ 390 ) } June 28t 390 ) } June 28th 372 ) } June 28th 340 ) } June 28th 309 ) } June 28th 275 ) } June 28th just one is enough . 0 ) } I want to see a beautiful light . 0 ) } ...

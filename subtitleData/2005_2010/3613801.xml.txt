 This dam project will create many new jobs . The Party and country will assist in your re-location . Grandma give me your hand . But where are they taking us ? It 'll be alright . Brother ! ... I will send you money . Who can write ? Who can read ? Who can weld ? I put a lot of faith into your organization . It 's a perfect replica , Roland . There are too many fanatics out there that could damage her . Just think of all the beautiful Buddah statues they blew up in Afghanistan . Our Heritage Organization has already made selections from the British Museum and L 'Hermitage . I guess , she 'll be safe now tucked away hidden in some bunker in Switzerland . Perfectly safe , Roland . Only infrared analysis can reveal the difference . But it 's still a fake . Laura can you hear me ? Roland is that you ? Laura .. they lied to us . I 've arranged a press conference for tomorrow . I will tell everyone the truth about what 's going on . What are you talking about ? The art you collected it 's not in the Alps . Those tunnels are empty . I have proof ! Laura .. can you hear me ? I 'm losing you Roland . I heard you would not come . Zultan , listen to me we are fighters , we never go down . No matter how hard they hit us . Kill the bastard ! Yuri - where are you going ? Do not believe in something , simply because you have heard it , Nima . But great Lama , Tenzin is my brother . He works inside the tunnel , where the ships are built . But what is there in your wisdom , great Lama , if Tenzin is right . What if our world is indeed coming to an end ? It is full , great Ringoche . Like this cup you are full of opinions and speculations . To see the light of wisdom you first must empty your cup . Be careful with the clutch , it tends to slip . Grandma ... Grandpa , Nima is here ! Grandma , I got a message from Tenzin . He wants us to meet him in Cho Ming at the work camp . He says he can get us on the ship he 's working on . What are you talking about ? Tenzin works on the dam . Grandma ... the dam is a ship . The government lied to us . There will be a big flood ! We must pack up right away . Nima ! Who gave you a truck ? We took a ride on the Liam Song ferry once Grandpa threw up the whole way . Let 's eat first . Who are they ? We found them along side of the road . Send them back ! I am a follower of our great Lama Ringoche . You know I cannot do that . We are all children of the Earth . My plan will not work for so many , Grandma . We will take them all . We have to hurry ! They are leaving ! Tenzin wait ! Grandma , we 're almost there ! Grandma , Grandpa ... I 'm sorry i could not save us . He has gone back in . He will fix it . There 's no way . Don 't lose your faith , brother .

 The world will have to deal with us . Previously on The 4400 : - Diana , what the hell are you doing ? - Diana 's not quite herself right now . She 'll do whatever Tess tells her to . Tess is schizophrenic . The strain of hiding out , the guilt over what we did . She can 't handle it . It 's caused a break . She needs medical care . I will not sacrifice Tess to you . You made your choice . But you 're my daughter . If you quit , I 'll stand by you . Isabelle . Daddy ? What about my father ? Has anybody heard from him ? They did something to me last night . Those people who came into my room , they were dressed for an operation . Yeah , they put something into me . Matthew . What if they took whatever is inside of him and put it into me ? Please just tell me that you 're still you . I think so . - Hey . - Sorry . I know it 's late . I 'm not interrupting anything , am I ? No . No , I was just- - Good . Because I didn 't know where else to go . I was out with friends . The Rep is doing a revival of Arcadia . You know , that Tom Stoppard play ? Anyway , when the show let out , I found this on my windshield . Every car on the block had one . So basically , if you wanna be cool , take promicin . On the news , I heard a story about two middle-school kids who took the shot . Twelve years old . Both died . We 're losing the war , Tom . Moving . Stops . This one 's my favorite . Come on , everyone . Let 's- - Let 's dance . Hello , this is Shawn . - Shawn , it 's Kevin Burkhoff . - Dr. Burkhoff . Listen to me . I don 't have much time . It 's Tess , all right ? Her schizophrenia is out of control . I 've tried every combination of meds I can think of . Nothing works . So you have to help her or heal her . Before she hurts someone . - Can you get her to the Center ? - No , no , no . Listen to me . She 's taken over a diner , all right ? She won 't allow anyone to leave . We 're trapped here . Kevin . Put down the phone . Dr. Burkhoff . Where are you ? Where 's the diner located ? So this is the last one and then I 'm really leaving . - I 've kept you up long enough . - Maybe I should put on some coffee . You let me sit here for hours ranting about promicin and Jordan Collier , and then instead of kicking me out , you 're offering me coffee ? That 's so sweet . I don 't know about sweet . Selfish , maybe . Since Kyle left , it 's been pretty lonely around here . Besides , I know how stressful the job can be . I 'm the guy who thought he was possessed by some entity from the future . Had a perfectly harmless mole removed for no good reason . It 's healing okay , though , right ? - Let me look . - Yeah , I think so . Sorry . I don 't know why I did that . Maybe we could both use some coffee . Maybe later . Tell me again why we 're doing this at 6 : 30 in the morning . Because I like to have fresh tomatoes with my eggs . Besides , I love working in the garden . Makes me feel like I 'm contributing even though I don 't have an ability . Well , you gotta admit , it 's pretty amazing . A week ago , this place was a toxic wasteland . And now we 're having our first harvest . Well , you 're amazed now . Wait till we get to actually eat them . Okay , very funny . Who 's doing that ? Dad ? Hello , Isabelle . So , what 's it been now , six months ? Something like that . I have to say , all that time and you don 't seem so glad to see me . The last time I saw you , you tried to kill me . - Isabelle , I 'm not here to hurt you . - How 'd you get in here ? I have friends , 4400s who live here now . They left a key for me under the mat . Now if you don 't mind , I 'd like a moment alone with my daughter . - Kyle , it 's okay . - You sure ? Yeah . Why are you here ? I wanted to apologize . Tell you how sorry I am for being such a lousy father . I guess I wasn 't exactly the best daughter . You needed guidance . Someone to teach you right from wrong . I wasn 't there for you . I tried , but I didn 't do a very good job . You were so powerful , even as a baby . I was never comfortable with that . And then you grew up overnight . And your mother aging the way she did , I tried to deny it , but I guess part of me blamed you for her death . Maybe I was responsible . I still don 't know . - But I never meant to hurt her . - I know that . But all the other bad things I did ? They were my fault . My decisions . Not yours . You weren 't ready to make those kind of decisions . You were used by the future , by Dennis Ryland . If I had been stronger , I could 've prevented all of that , but instead , I allowed things to get ugly between us . And we both paid the price . All I want is for us is to be father and daughter again . I want that too . You 'll stay , right ? I want you to . So do I . Hello , Richard . Welcome to Promise City . Sorry . Tom , the second time , we did it with the lights on . It 's not like there 's anything you haven 't seen . Could you help me ? Right . Yeah . I 'll have to make a quick stop at home to change . Good , then we won 't be showing up at the same time . This is only gonna be weird if we let it . - Well , we 're not going to , right ? - Right . - Right . - Last night was fun . It 's been a rough couple of months . We both needed a little distraction , a little comfort . There doesn 't have to be anything more than that , okay ? So you 're saying last night was just a one-time thing ? Well , yeah . I think so . - Don 't you ? - Oh , yeah . Have that list I asked for ? Every diner in the greater Seattle area that has a jukebox . Are you sure it was ' 50s music you heard ? Pretty sure I heard Chuck Berry . You 're gonna have to cancel all my appointments for today and tomorrow . Are you sure you should be going after Dr. Burkhoff ? He 's a wanted man . You could get in a lot of trouble . Kevin saved my life and the lives of all the other 4400s after the government 's inhibitor program almost killed us all . And besides , if there 's anyone that can reduce the risk of taking promicin , it 's him . He 's worth it . What 's wrong with everyone ? Why aren 't they dancing ? Are they trying to ruin my party ? Tess . They 've been dancing for two days . They 're exhausted . They need sleep . So do you . Sleep ? Why would anyone wanna sleep ? It 's a party . What would Bobby think if he showed up and I was sleeping ? I love Bobby . Yes . He has eyes just like Montgomery Clift . Soulful , you know ? Where is he , anyway ? Why isn 't he here yet ? Maybe he 's not coming . You 're just jealous because Bobby 's my boyfriend and you 're not . - Tess , that 's not why . - No , I don 't wanna hear it . Bobby cares about me . He 's so sweet . He 'd do anything for me . - Everybody get up . Everybody dance . - Okay . Tess . So one fugitive to another , tell me how you managed to stay off NTAC 's radar all these months . I had lots of help . 4400s who risked their freedom to give me shelter , money , pretty much anything I needed . These friends of yours , how do they feel about promicin ? About people developing abilities ? The world 's changed , Jordan . You changed it . They 're just trying to figure out where they fit in . I 'll tell you where they fit in . Right here in Promise City . Everyone with an ability belongs here . This is a pretty amazing place you 've created here . Oh , I didn 't do it . Not alone , anyway . Everyone here has helped to make Promise City a reality . Including you . No , I 'm serious . All the work that you did for me at the Center , everything that you accomplished , it all led to us being here . If you say so . But there is work yet ahead of us . Plenty of it . And I could use your help , Richard . Guess telekinesis could come in handy in case the government ever decides- - No , no , no . That 's a remarkable ability , yes . But it 's your leadership I could really use . These people , they respect you . They listen to you . You can make a big difference . I 'm here to reconnect with my daughter , not join the movement . Well , I hope you 'll consider doing both . We need to ... Kyle says they 're throwing you a welcome party . Guess I should feel honored . Mr. Tyler , it 's so good to have you with us . Thank you . You see that ? Everyone 's glad you 're here . Including me . Jordan 's been great , and Kyle too . But I 'm the only person here without an ability . I still feel like I don 't belong . And I was kind of hoping you could help me find my way , you know ? That 's why I 'm here , Isabelle . To help you all I can . Starting right now . You 're gonna feel a little dizzy , Isabelle . Don 't be scared . Daddy ? It 's okay . Everything 's gonna be just fine . Jordan . Richard 's gone . He took Isabelle with him . Okay , wait for it . No doubt about it . The man is a genuine badass . Well , maybe when we catch him , you can ask for his autograph . Now we know why we never caught up with him . He 's hiding with Jordan . No , I don 't think so . If Richard was with Collier , we 'd have known it . He 's too important to be background . He managed to get into Promise City without us even knowing . Which means he could 've left just as discreetly . He was in a hurry . I couldn 't tell if Isabelle was unconscious or dead . He did try to kill her once before , right ? He sure did . Why carry the body away ? I think it looks like a kidnapping . I guess we won 't know until we find him . Well , we could start by talking to Jordan Collier . He did say he was willing to keep the communication lines open , so let 's see how serious he is . Knock on his front door . See if anyone answers . Take it easy . Your head 's gonna hurt for a little while . You should drink some water . You 'll feel better . What did you do to me ? Stopped the flow of blood to your brain . Only for a few seconds . Just enough for you to pass out . Why ? Where are you taking me ? Away from Collier 's war . Away from Promise City . We don 't belong there . That 's the only place we 're safe . The government , NTAC , they 're all gonna come after us . They 're not gonna find us . I promise . I 'm sorry I had to do it like that , but it 's for the best . From now on , we 're gonna be a family again . Got a long trip ahead of us . You should eat something . I 'm not hungry . I wanna go back . It 's not gonna happen . You have to accept that . Come on . You gotta keep your strength up . At least drink some water . Please . I can 't do it anymore . It 's been two days . We need to stop . Rest . I don 't believe this . Wake him up . - The rest of you keep dancing . - Get him some water . Come with me . Tess , you are torturing those poor people and it 's going to stop right now . This is my big night , Kevin . A girl only turns 1 6 once . You turned 1 6 back in 1 953 . That was a long time ago , and you never even had a sweet-1 6 party . You told me you had your first schizophrenic attack the night before and your parents called it off . - No , that 's not true . - Yes , it is . This is my party . I want Bobby . Where 's Bobby ? Where 's- - ? Listen to me . Even if Bobby were alive , he 'd be , like , what , 70 ? That 's a lie . You don 't know what you 're saying . Look at those people . Look at them . You see what you 're doing to them ? Get your hand off me . No . Tess , don 't . I 'm afraid there 's not much to say , Tom . Richard Tyler was only here for a few hours . I 'm afraid he didn 't inform me of any plot to kidnap his daughter . Do you have any idea where he 's taken her ? Did he mention where he 's been hiding ? Safe house ? Friends ? Sorry , Dad . Richard didn 't tell us anything . There is one name . Michael Ancelet . Ancelet ? I remember that name . He 's an original 4400 . When Richard was running security at the Center , Michael was his deputy . If Richard goes to anyone for help , it might well be him . - Well , thanks for the lead . - I hope it pans out . Jordan , why would you help them ? My dad will throw Richard and Isabelle in prison . We welcomed Richard Tyler into our home . We trusted him . He broke that trust . We owe him nothing . And besides , helping NTAC apprehend a fugitive puts your father in our debt . That could prove useful . What about Isabelle ? Do you care what happens ? Kyle , I understand you two have grown close . But Isabelle 's role in the movement has never been clearly defined . Neither the book nor Cassie have made any mention of her importance . She 's important to me . I 'm going to find her before my father does . Kyle . Kyle . A rescue attempt is reckless at best . Losing you vastly outweighs the benefit of finding Isabelle . Don 't do anything foolish . How long have you been planning this ? Ever since I found out you moved to Promise City . You could probably use some sleep . Your room is at the top of the stairs through the door . Dad , this is a kid 's room . There 's no way I 'm gonna fit in that little bed . Don 't worry about it . I 've got that covered . You 're gonna be happy here . Safe . I 'll be sure of it . Daddy ! Everything 's okay . Don 't be scared . Something 's wrong . I think I 'm shrinking . What did you do to me ? I told you , Isabelle . We 're starting over . You 're not getting smaller , you 're getting younger . What ? Daddy , what am I ? Fourteen ? Fifteen ? For now , anyway . What is that supposed to mean ? How much younger am I gonna get ? I 'm just trying to help you , Isabelle . Find a way to make things better for you . For months , that 's all I could think about . Then I met Cora . She has an amazing ability . She can actually make people younger . That 's what I can give you . A chance to start over , to have a normal childhood . Soon you 'll forget about those things you did , all those regrets weighing you down . Daddy , I was doing fine on my own . You don 't have to do this , Daddy . Please . Do you know what the happiest day of my life was ? It was back when we were living at the Center . Your mother was working for the healing foundation with Shawn . I took you to Madison Park . To the playground . I put you on my lap and we sat on one of the swings . I rocked you back and forth , must have been 20 minutes . You laughed the whole time . It was a perfect day . The next morning , you woke up 20 years older and your mother was dying in front of my eyes . I want us to be able to start over and now we can . I have started over . I have my own life now . It might not be perfect , but it 's mine . Please don 't take that away from me , Daddy . I know this is scary for you . But soon , you won 't remember any of this . This is the water you gave me in the car . That 's how this all started , isn 't it ? It 's in the water ? Is that how you 're doing this ? Isabelle . Isabelle . Kevin , I brought you some butter . My mom said it 's good for burns . Well , thank you , but my hand 's fine . How could that be ? It was all black and blistered . I can heal myself , Tess . It 's my ability from when I took the shot . Just like you can compel people to do things against their will . Sometimes , Kevin , you say the craziest things . I guess that 's why I like you . Oh , my goodness . That must be Bobby . Everybody , look like you 're having fun . Hey , Tess . - Bobby ? - It 's about time , Bobby . Tess was worried . She was afraid you weren 't gonna show up , Bobby . - Where you been ? - I 'm sorry . I had some car trouble . Well , you 're here now . - And that 's all that matters . - What are you doing ? Bobby is going to help you , Tess . He 's gonna make you feel better . - I feel fine . - Believe me , you 're not fine . That 's okay . I can make that all better . All you have to do is just take my hands . - It 's real easy . - No . Don 't touch me . You 're not Bobby . You two are playing a joke on me . A horrible , nasty joke . You 're right . I 'm not Bobby . But I really am here to help you , Tess . You 're sick , Tess . Shawn is a healer . There 's nothing wrong with me . Stop saying there is . - Listen to me . - No . Gloria needs a partner . - Tess , just listen to me- - - No talking . Just dancing . - Tess ... - And you ? You 're not my friend anymore . You 're mean . I hate you . Why are you still here , Kyle ? Isabelle needs you . - I promised Jordan . - Jordan is wrong . Don 't look so surprised . Even messiahs make mistakes sometimes . Do you know where Richard took her ? As a matter of fact , I do . I 'll be right with you . Just have to get this thought down . It seems like you 've had a lot of those lately , Mr. Ancelet . It 's my autobiography . - Well , you must have had a busy life . - I 'm about to start on 4th grade . What are we talking about here ? Some kind of total recall ? That 's right . I remember people , events , dreams , just thoughts even . If I experienced it , I remember it . All of it . - You 're writing it all down ? - Only thing that keeps me sane . Otherwise , it just builds up in my head until it feels like my brain is gonna explode . Mr. Ancelet , you know why we 're here ? - Richard Tyler . - Do you know where he is ? I know he 's my friend . I understand . Friendship 's important . But , Mike , aiding and abetting a fugitive , a 4400 , that 's ... That 's a prison sentence . And in that prison , you 're not gonna get computers or pens or paper . No , it 'll just be you . Alone with your thoughts . Isabelle . Isabelle . Where are you ? Isabelle ? Isabelle . How 's that soup ? I like the noodles . That boy ? The one at the Center ? The one I like so much ? What was his name again ? Shawn Farrell . I was mean to him , wasn 't I ? I 'm having a hard time remembering things . That 's okay . We 'll make new memories . Better ones . All it takes is one big sip , then we 're done . And then what ? I won 't be me anymore . It 'll be like I never existed . If your mother were here , she 'd want us to do this . She 'd want us to be a family again . Be together . Stay here . Isabelle . - What did you do to her ? - It 's a 4400 ability . He wants to turn me into a baby again . Richard , this is crazy . - You have to stop this . - This is between me and my daughter . - It has nothing to do with you . - Daddy , don 't . Kyle is my friend . He 's the first person who ever believed in me , believes that I could change . She 's not the same person you knew . If you 'd spent more time in Promise City , you 'd have seen that . Come on , Isabelle . - Where do you think you 're going ? - Away from here . Okay , we 'll fix this , okay ? I promise you . Tess . Can I talk to you for a second ? It 's about Bobby . He 's here . - No , he 's not . - Yes , he is . He 's right over there . That 's just Kevin . Hey , Bobby loves you , right ? He 's always there for you . - He 'd do anything to make you happy . - Yes , he would . And I 'm telling you , that 's Bobby . Go over to him . Look into his eyes . See for yourself . Bobby ? Is that really you ? I 've been waiting for you a long time . Well , I 'm here now . Promise you 'll never leave me again . I promise . I 'm so tired . I know you are . Shawn can help . He can make you feel better . Would you like that ? That would be nice . You ready ? Kevin . I was so scared . And sick . I hurt these people , didn 't I ? It 's all right . You 're better now . You 're gonna be better from now on . I 'm so sorry . We should go . They 're not gonna remember any of this , right ? Not if I don 't want them to . Backup is five minutes out . - We should go in now . - What ? If we go in hot , we 'll be forcing Richard to fight back . You saw what he did to the guardsmen outside Promise City . You really think you can talk him down ? It 's worth a try . I 'm not gonna hurt him , Isabelle . You have my word . Richard . Richard , it 's over , all right ? Dad ? We have to go , Isabelle . Oh , boy . Oh , God . - You okay ? - Yeah . - You 're okay ? - Yeah . Diana , do me a favor and make sure everyone 's okay out there . And stall them as long as you can , okay ? I 'll see what I can do . - Where 's your car ? - Out back . Come on . NTAC doesn 't know you 're here . This way . But I 'd stay off the main roads , just to be safe . You 're letting me go ? Yeah , it looks that way . You gonna be able to get back to Promise City ? Yeah , I got out , didn 't I ? Thanks , Dad . - Okay , go . Just go . - Okay . Promise City ? It 's the last place I 'd wanna live . I thought that you and Jordan were close . - Not anymore . - He scares me . He always has . Yeah , this messiah complex he 's developed ? Very disturbing . And all this talk about heaven and Earth ? Frankly , I don 't buy it . You can stay here as long as you like . Well , that 'd be wonderful . But we 're fugitives . If they track us here , you could be in a lot of trouble . It 's a risk I 'm willing to take . You can use our medical facilities to continue your research . Find a way to make promicin safer . Tell him , Kevin . What ? That 's really only a theory at this point . Well , I 'd like to hear it . Well , I 'm putting together profiles of the people who 've taken the shot , the ones we know of , anyway , to see if I could discover why some survive and others don 't . Okay . And the initial research is promising . Pretty soon , Kevin thinks he 'll be able to predict who will survive the shot and who won 't . And if people know for certain that promicin will kill them , they won 't take the shot . And a lot less people would die . Isabelle , did you hear what I said to you ? You don 't have to drink the rest of it if you don 't want to . And if I don 't , then what ? I start my life over again as an 8-year-old ? You could go see Cora . Maybe she can reverse the process . Age you back to where you were . That boy , Kyle , risked his life to come find you . Someone cared that much about you , says a lot about him . About you . Maybe you have changed . Maybe you 're a different person now . But you still want me to drink it , don 't you ? I just want us to have more perfect days , Isabelle . But like I said , it 's up to you now . I 'm scared . I 'm right here . You know , I had him . He was standing right there in front of me and I let him go . But what else could you do ? Arrest him ? I thought if I ever got him out of Promise City , that 's exactly what I would have done . If I didn 't wanna bring him into NTAC , I would have brought him here until I figured out a next step . What would you have done ? Locked Kyle in his bedroom ? He would have taken off the moment you turned your back . Tom , you had a choice between Promise City and prison . If it was my kid , I would have done exactly the same thing . Am I making you feel any better at all ? Yeah . Yeah . Sorry . Thanks , by the way , for coming over here and letting me ramble . Sure . We 're friends , right ? Yeah . Friends . Right ? - Okay , we 're good friends . - Good friends . - What ? - I felt something behind your ear . - What ? - Turn around . Show me . Your mole is back . - Isabelle ? - Daddy .

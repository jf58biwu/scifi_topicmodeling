 In the future , my son will lead mankind in a war against Skynet the computer system programmed to destroy the world . It has sent machines back through time . Some to kill him . One to protect him . Today we fight to stop Skynet from ever being created . To change our future . To change his fate . The war to save mankind begins now . Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles . My Turk plays chess at a level that could defeat every human player that has ever lived , and probably ever will live . This is my partner , Dmitri Shipkov . I built the Turk , but Dmitri taught it to play chess . You talk about it like it 's human . Well , you never know . Show me what you found . No name , but he 's got this tattoo on his arm . That 's a tattoo from a Skynet work camp . He 's a Resistance fighter . Then you know him , in the future . So do you . He 's one of your best soldiers . It was you , wasn 't it ? You wanted to kill him , and you did . I didn 't do it . All I wanted was the Turk . Somebody else killed him and took the machine . You gotta get out of here . If you haven 't figured it out , I have a T-Triple-8 on my ass . Now if you found me , it will too . He needs a doctor . What , so you 're just gonna go out and kidnap one ? Ugh , don 't let that thing touch me . - We have to stop your bleeding . - Get away from me ! - You don 't even know who this guy is ! - He 's your uncle . He doesn 't know . Possible forced entry and sabotage at Vista Terrace power plant . All available units respond . Code 3 . This is an emergency evacuation . Proceed to emergency exits . Remain calm and exit the building immediately . Let 's go . This is an emergency evacuation . Proceed to the emergency-lighted exit . They say that when a person dies , the soul lives on . The soul . The thing that separates us from the machines . Cameron had burned the metal monster . Two thousand degrees . I suppose they did the same to Andy . There was nothing left of either . Nothing that told the story of who or what they were . Gone is gone . Ashes to ashes , dust to dust . When I go , bury me in the earth . Part of me died years ago with Kyle Reese . But a part of him lives on in John . If that 's not a soul , I don 't know what is . - The Triple-8 ? - Vaporized . The Russian , Dmitri ? - You found him ? - He took off after Andy 's murder . Now , if he has the Turk , then ... . Put the machine on it . She 'll find him . - It 's- - - I know . It 's what they do . - How is he ? - Better . Still pretty out of it . Is he gonna stay here ? Or what ? Let 's see if he lives first . And somewhere in this city , a naked cop bleeds in an alley . The hand . Couldn 't acquire it . - Why not ? - The fbi has it . You 're playing hooky . Today ? No , I can 't miss class today , Mom . We have to find the hand . Destroy it . No loose ends . Cyberdyne built Skynet . - With the chip , remember ? - And the hand . Look , the feds have it now , Mom . I can 't help . Besides , absent gets me on the radar . I can play hooky . Find Dmitri . Derek says he has a sister , teaches ballet . Start with her . Low profile , no guns . You might wanna change . Yeah , this is Sergeant Johnson , Senior Property over at L.A.P.D. Got a problem , wonder if you could help . - What 's going on ? - We got this new booking officer , rookie . I think he was drunk when he logged evidence on a robbery we had . Might have ended up on your felony escape . - What are you missing ? - Prosthetic hand . - Really ? - Really . DR number ? 084476732 . I can send someone to pick it up . - Mm. I don 't see any hand on here . - You sure ? Item 17 . - Hey , hang on a second . Agent Ellison . - Yeah ? I got L.A.P.D. Property on the line . Asking about a hand . From your felony escape . They have it listed on the authorization but we don 't have a record of it . I never saw any hand , fake or otherwise . Agent in charge says he never saw it . Wanna talk to him ? No . No , no , I 'll take his word . Thanks . I wonder if God or the devil or even death was sending me a message from the future all the way back through time . " Machines , Sarah , machines . You can pretend they 're not , but they are coming and they are faster and stronger . And they have been built to do one perfect thing : To kill you . They will kill you and your friends and your family and your mother and your father and Kyle Reese and your son . Your son . " " They will kill everyone you love and everyone you hold close and there is nothing you can do about it because they are coming . They are coming and they will find you . Because that 's what they do ! That 's all they do ! " - That 's all they do ! - I need help here ! Let go . - Get in here ! - They 'll kill you ! - Come on , where 's that stuff ? - They will kill you ! Let me- - Now , if what you 're saying is true , Sarah surely there would be some evidence . No one believes me . Thank you . This is where Sarah Connor spent three years of her life ? This is it . Dr. Silberman retired right after she escaped . Where is he these days ? Got himself a cabin in the mountains near Arrowhead . Growing his own vegetables and working on his book . We don 't hear much from him anymore . I 'd love to talk to any staff that was here when she escaped . unfortunately , there 's no one left . Not even the janitor ? How long would you work here if you could find another job ? All right . Good . Go on , reach down . Excellent turn out . Hold . Hold . And close . Beautiful . Thank you . See you all next week . Bye , Neil . What is she doing ? Pas de chat . Step of the cat . - will you show me ? - That is the advanced class . You are a beginner , yeah ? You have taken ballet before . No . The height is nice . Beautiful feet . But your upper body is little mechanical , yeah ? Remember , you are a cat . I 'm a cat . Come next week . We need to develop your flexibility and your imagination . Remember , dance is the hidden language of the soul , yeah ? What are you doing ? What 's it look like ? Looks like you 're loading guns that I know for a fact are already loaded . True enough . I loaded them . Look no offense , I just don 't like firing a weapon I didn 't set myself . Anyway , you should take it into the kitchen or something . Mom wouldn 't like you doing this in her room . Why ? Because it 's her room . Listen , um the paramedic that patched me up , where 'd he come from ? That 's Charlie . He was her boyfriend . Her fianc√© actually . Long time ago though . Look , man , he 's not gonna tell anybody . How do you know ? Because I know him. I trust him . I can 't believe you trust anybody . Maybe it 's just him . You trust the machine . - Cameron , she- - - Yeah , Cameron . What a joke . Walking around with a name like it 's a person . It 's not a person. lt 's not something you should be trusting . What 's going on ? Nothing . I need you to get on the computer and find an address . You 're making a mistake . - How 's that ? - The machine has gotta go . You had me sending her out to do our dirty work . Dirty work is all they 're good for . Don 't think that you can train them like a pet . It 'lI be the last thing you think . - John-- - John doesn 't know everything . - You should be resting . - No . They never rest . You can 't have that thing here . Can 't sleep with it here . That gonna help ? You never know . Does it help to sleep on the whole trunk ? Go into my bedroom again , I 'll bust your head . What happened with the ballet teacher ? Dance is the language of the soul . First , you have to have a soul . I mean , about Dmitri or the Turk . I 'm going back today . - What 's the status on the hand ? - Got a good idea who has it . - Who ? - fbi Agent Ellison . The guy who questioned me in county lockup ? What , they only have one fbi agent in this town ? The only one who could put this whole thing together . From what I saw at his house , maybe he already has . Pancakes . We eat at the table . - Your pancakes are getting cold . - Here 's Dr. Silberman 's address . You 're not hungry ? No . Since when ? Miss Connor , I 'm from DCFS . I 've brought some paperwork . Everything should be in order . All we have to do is cross the T 's and dot the I 's . It states that you voluntarily and unequivocally consent . You 've been advised of the consequences of this relinquishment . You understand that your consent is irrevocable . And once these papers are signed , all parental rights will be terminated . And sign here . We 'll get a certified copy to the judge . I guess you 're not hungry either . You might have fooled them , but not me . I know you . I know you too . Dr. Silberman . Can I help you ? Special Agent James Ellison . Well , hello . What can I do for you , agent ? I 'd like to talk to you about Sarah Connor . You like to come in ? Thank you . I don 't like to use the term " textbook " in relation to any of my patients but Sarah Connor was depressed , anxiety-ridden manic violent with paranoid delusions . Is that what it was ? Delusions ? Robots , soldiers of the future , apocalypse . You tell me . Also , she could be remarkably charming and even persuasive . Beware of false prophets . Are you a man of the Book ? It has brought me comfort at times . More tea ? Yes , yes , thank you . Thing that most people don 't understand about psychiatry is that it is an imperfect science . What are you doing here ? Watching you . I 'm a little out of shape . Teaching takes all my time . My brother says if you wanna be good at anything , you have to practice every day . Your brother is right . Do you have a brother ? Yes . Is he a dancer like you ? He plays chess . So does my brother . Excuse me . Get lost . Do you have any idea who this is ? No , do you ? Who are you ? You are just a girl . How did you do that ? I 'm looking for your brother . Are you police ? I 've already told the police everything I know . No , I 'm not police . But I do find them useful . What do you want ? I can help your brother . tell me where he is . Untie me . FBI , that 's a good touch . What ? Who- - ? Who do you- - ? Who do you think I am ? I know who you are ... - Yes . - Yeah . Matthew 7 : 15 , the full verse is : Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep 's clothing but inwardly , they are ravening wolves . You 're from the future . - You 're one of them . - I 'm- - ? I 'm- - ? Oh , come on . Okay , if I was who you say I am , then how could- - ? How could you have poisoned me ? The tea was a test but then it occurred to me that you could be an advanced model . Smart enough to trick me into thinking you were passed out . Oh , come on . Come on . Look . Look , kidnapping an fbi agent is a federal offense . Carries a sentence of life in prison . If you let me go now , we 'll forget this ever happened , okay ? - One sure-fire way to- - - Wait . Wait , wait . No ! No ! You can 't . No ! No ! John hasn 't been answering his cell phone . When he gets home , will you tell him we need to talk ? Where you heading ? Arrowhead . I think Ellison might be there . He 's a strong boy . You know , strong opinions . - I don 't know where he gets that . - His father ? Out of the picture . That 's too bad . Can I ask you about my brother ? Kyle ? John told me he died fighting ? Do you know where he is now ? In the grass . I can take you there someday if you want . It 's an honest mistake . Can 't be too careful . tell me do you believe in the apocalypse , agent ? Yeah . I 've read Revelations . Could it be that the apocalypse in the Book and the predictions of Sarah Connor are one and the same ? Um ... . I suppose it 's possible . What do you think ? He came down the hall . It was a large man . I thought it was a man until he threw the guard through the window just like a rag doll . Not an ounce of emotion , just blank like a death mask . Then the other one came . There was two of them ? They were different . The second one was almost beautiful , like , perfect like a changeling . The face of mercury . What about Sarah ? She was there . She was on the floor and the boy was with her . He was screaming . And then the first one , the big one I 'll never forget , he reached out his hand and he said : " Come with me if you wanna live . " It was like God reaching out to man like the Sistine Chapel . The hand of God . Hand of God . Yeah . Though there 's no proof , so we don 't talk about it all of us who were there . What if I told you I have proof ? What do you mean ? Piece of evidence I found during my investigation . That 's why I came to you . For your cooperation . To show you that Sarah wasn 't crazy . Nobody is crazy . What is it ? The hand of God . It 's a good thing you told me about this . Yeah . I told you , I 'm on your side . I wish that were true . What does that mean ? Do you know what would happen if the wrong people got ahold of this ? I can 't let you stop her . She 's dead . Well , so was Jesus once . - You won 't feel a thing . - What ? No , no ! Dug up some clean T-shirts for you . Thanks . I wasn 't sure how many you 'd need . Depends on how long you 're staying . Not that great sleeping on the couch , is it ? Slept on a few of them myself . Yeah ? When was that ? When my mom was locked up . I kicked around . Friends and foster families . Mom was in prison ? Mental hospital . You go around blowing up buildings and ranting about robots , it happens . That sounds rough . There was this- - There was this one family , Todd and Janelle . I was with them for a while and they were okay . Of course , I hated them . They wanted to adopt me . I 'm sure your mom would have died before she let that happen . Yeah , you 'd think . Look , John what can happen to a person inside four walls screws with your head . Makes you do things you never thought you 'd do . Some people never give up . Some people always fight . Fewer than you 'd think . So you ever wonder what happened to Todd and Janelle ? No . I know what happened . I got them killed . Dima . tell him , come on . You 're the one who reported the Turk missing . - Do you have more ? - What happened to it ? A man came to see me . Offered me money to steal the Turk . I owed money to the people who helped me bring my sister into this country so I changed the endgame protocols in order for it to lose its last match . If we 'd won and we would have won , I never could have gotten it out of there . I was paid money for it , $ 20,000 . It wasn 't enough . I need more of these . Please , I need more of these . Who bought the Turk ? Okay . That 's all I have . Okay ? Dima . Thank you for explaining . Where are you going ? Hey , where do you go ? You promised you 'd help us ! Hey . This way . Hey ! Oh , my God . I 'm sorry I ever doubted you . Apology accepted . Help ! Help ! Get up . Where is it ? She took it . What ? Who ? Sarah Connor . She took it . She took it . Did you find the Turk ? Dmitri stole it from Andy then sold it to a man . Who ? Where 's Dmitri now ? Dead . So 's his sister . Did you kill them ? No . It wasn 't my mission . I never wanted you to see that tape . I was gonna destroy it . But since you did , did you notice the date ? The date on the tape ? June 8 , 1997 . Do you know that date ? I do now . It 's the date you gave up being my mother . It 's the date I broke out of there . The day you came for me I was coming for you . Because about three seconds after I signed that paper I knew I couldn 't live with it . I was coming for you and I was gonna die trying . You almost did . So did you . And you were mad as hell about it . Yelled at me and told me what a stupid move it was . I might have oversold that a little . I 'll always find you . I 'll always find you . There was a time I was a hero to my son . He thought I walked on water . He knows better now . We all have weak moments moments where we lose faith . But it 's our flaws our weaknesses that make us human . They 're here . They 're here . They 're here ! They 're everywhere ! They 're here ! They 're here ! Science now performs miracles like the gods of old . Creating life from blood cells or bacteria or a spark of metal . But they 're perfect creatures and in that way , they couldn 't be less human . There are things machines will never do . They cannot possess faith , they cannot commune with God . Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire . They cannot appreciate beauty . They cannot create art . If they ever learn these things , they won 't have to destroy us . They 'll be us .

 Torchwood . Outside the Government , beyond the Police . Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race . The 21st century is when everything changes ... and Torchwood is ready . Hm ! Cheeky bugger ! Jonah Bevan , born 15th February 1993 , son of Nikki Bevan and Paul Millet , 14 Cliffs Rise , Penarth . Disappeared walking home from football practice , been missing now for seven months and eleven days . No body , no sightings since that night . Disappeared right where we 're standing . Uh-huh . Which is where we found this . He sent a text to his mum , she was looking out the window and they waved . She says everywhere was deserted . And the investigation ? Usual procedure - searched the home , spoken to all friends and relatives , made publicity appeals , but no significant leads ... Is this beneath you now ? No ! Then what 's with the attitude ? You 've a face like a slapped arse . I want you to tell me where you were . Where I was when ? At the wedding . I rang you . I had to work . Temple changed the rota at the last minute . I checked the duty logs . You had three days off . Are you spying on me now ? I thought we were mates . And you just don 't turn up ! I just thought , being as Rhys has got a problem with me ... Rhys thinks you 're great ! It 's you who has a problem with him ! You 've always made sarky comments about his weight ! He could stand to lose a couple of pounds ... Let it go ! Let it go . Yeah , well , I can 't ! All right ? I don 't want to sit there and watch you pledge your stupid life to him ! I 've got better things to do of a Saturday ! Happy now ? Oh , Andy ! Get off ! I thought we 'd been through this . You 're a lovely fella ... It 's not like a bloody tap . I can 't just switch it off . But this was three years ago . I mean , I didn 't know ... I didn 't realise you still had feelings ... I don 't , all right ? I just had a moment . Don 't flatter yourself . OK ! If you want to talk about it ... I wanna talk about this kid . Jonah . Teenagers go missing all the time . I mean , why is this one so special ? I was the first one here . Sat with his mum all night and all the next day . Every time I tell her we 've got nothing new , I see a bit of her die . Anything strange about the case ? Like you don 't know . What just happened ? Exactly . The camera records one frame every six seconds . He could 've done a lot in six seconds , jumped over the side ... No , he 's looking at something glowing , just out of the camera 's line of sight . Like a flare , it 's not there in the previous frame ... or the next . Could be one of the lights on the Barrage . All right , stop lying . You know what happened here . Why aren 't you telling me ? What are you talking about , Andy ? Right ... 45 minutes later ... What 's your mate Mulder doing there ? Jack ? No recognisable rift activity around the Barrage on that date . What about if you tried ... ? I ran checks for three months either side . Then extended the radius by a mile and checked again . Still nothing . OK . Thanks . When did you say this was ? About seven months back . Were you on the Barrage that night ? They have this cute little coffee shack . I sometimes stop by there . A boy went missing . Just under an hour before you were there . OK . Jonah Bevan , 15 years old . I thought maybe you were out there because of him . Maybe if we 'd registered rift activity . No . I just checked with Tosh . It was all clear . Sorry . Can 't help . Do you want me to look into it for you ? No , it 's fine . So it was just a coincidence then ? Guess so . Gotta go . Weevil hunting with Ianto . So , you 're covering it up then ? Jack said it was a coincidence . I can 't help . Thanks a lot . Should 've known . Bloody Torchwood . Fob me off , why don 't you ? No . If there was something going on , I would tell you . Do you know what 's happened to you , Gwen ? You 've got hard . Yeah ? Well , maybe I 've had to . You used to care . You used to be bothered about people . Didn 't matter who they were , or what they did . And now you 're talking about coincidence , like people go missing all the time . Like it 's a fact of life . The old Gwen would have been up there to see Nikki Bevan in a flash . You 're one of them now , aren 't you ? Too busy to bother with one missing child . What is it , not major enough for you ? Not spooky enough ? Sorry to bother you . Nikki Bevan ? Gwen Cooper . I 'm working with the police on Jonah 's disappearance . Andy said you might be round . Oh , he did , did he ? Reckons you 've got a different area of expertise . What is it , forensics ? I 'm just a fresh eye . Sorry about the mess . Wow , film fan , are you ? Crowds . Sorry ? It 's all crowd footage . Ever since he went . Football matches , concerts , festivals ... Anywhere there 's a crowd , I record it . Go through it , frame by frame , checking every face . Sometimes I think it 's him , but the picture 's so grainy , I spend hours looking at one corner of the screen . But then the next day , I check again and it 's not . It 's the hope that 's killing me . Even if you saw him , what would you do ? Find someone that was with him . If I could just let him know I saw him . He 's gotta be out there somewhere . Do you think I 'm mad ? No , I think you 'd make a great policewoman . His room 's as he left it ? I sleep in here some nights . Bury my head in the pillow . It still smells of him . Except , the more I do it , the more it smells like me . I keep his diary for him . I sit in here and imagine I 'm him . What do you think I did wrong ? Sorry ? SHE SIGHS Maybe I was too nosey ... or not interested enough . Maybe he felt unloved . All I 've got is questions . What about Jonah 's dad ? We were only together about six weeks . I thought when he first went missing and was on the telly , his dad might get in touch . But no , still manages to disappoint . Oh , hang on ! Andy tried to find me a support group , but there weren 't any . So I thought I 'd set one up myself . It 's our first meeting . Will you come ? Oh , I dunno . Andy 'll be there . And I 'm gonna do food . Oh , come on . I don 't wanna be sat there on my own . I 'll try , I 've got to go . I 'm sorry , I know , I 'm late . Three hours ! It was a work thing , time just got away from me . Ooh , wine ! We can do it another time though , yeah ? This is the fourth another time , Gwen ! You said you 'd cook . Did I ? When are we gonna have this talk ? Let 's do it now . Come on , now 's good , I 'm ready . Babies . Now . Really ? Have I changed ? Eh ? Since I joined Torchwood . Am I different ? Why ? It 's just something Andy said . OK , let me just tell you this one thing , OK ? Go on . He still fancies me . Don 't laugh , Rhys . That 's why he didn 't come to the wedding . Bloody hell . Poor sod . Oi ! I am a very sexy lady ... and you are a very lucky man ! Just remember that , OK ? We 're not gonna talk about kids tonight , are we ? We could do some practising . Oh-ho-ho ! Tell me you love me ! Gimme the toast . Come on , tell me you love me first ! Gimme the toast first ! Tell me you love me ! MOBILE PHONE BEEPS Whoa ! Hey ! 'Gwen . ' Hi , Tosh . I 've dug up some new data on that night at the Barrage . I think you might wanna take a look at it . I 'll be right there . Deserting me , are you ? Yep . Ugh , crumbs . Oi ! Hey , what have you got ? It 's barely a blip on the system . So insignificant , I 've been ignoring it . But when I looked closer ... This is what we recognise as standard rift activity . But what I 've discovered is a negative rift spike that occurred at the time you 're querying . Now , we 've always assumed that these readings were residual rift flares . Like an aftershock . But , because this one coincided with Jonah 's disappearance , I think we 've been misinterpreting . OK , so ? So , we 've always believed that things can only come through the rift one way . What if we 're wrong ? What if the rift doesn 't just leave stuff behind ? What if it also takes ? Who else have you told about this ? No-one . I called you as soon as I realised . It could be a coincidence , or an anomaly . I can 't be sure unless I can cross-reference it with other examples . Can we keep this to ourselves ? There 's something I have to do . Whatever you think is best . Thank you , you 're a sweetheart . You 're looking into it , then . Still the same old me . Thank you . Yeah , well , I dunno why I bother , you 're so rude . How 's Rhys ? Other than hungry . Oh . It 's you two . Oh , that 's nice . I thought there 'd be more here by now . It 's gonna just be me , isn 't it ? No , I 'm sure it won 't . People will come . Yeah , you know , " If you build it , they will come " . Field Of Dreams ? No ? Just me , then . Anyway , sit down . It is gonna be just us , isn 't it ? KNOCK ON DOOR Hi . Um ... We 're looking for Nikki . Yeah , that 's me . Come in . It 's brilliant you found us . There 's food there , drinks , so help yourself . KNOCK ON DOOR Is this missing persons ? Yeah . Come in . Erm , do you wanna drink ? Bloody hell ! How many of them are there ? You OK ? It 's getting a bit too much now . I dunno what you mean . I said I 'd help you look for one lad . What about all those people in there , what ... 40 , 50 ? Am I supposed to help all them , too ? Course not . Just focus on Jonah . The rest aren 't part of this investigation . But they are . Of course they are . No , no , they 're not ! Find a pattern . Find out what happens , we might find Jonah . What ? Brilliant . You 're brilliant ! I 've gotta go . Where you going ? Cross-referencing ! Cross-referencing ? Cross-referencing ? You said we need more data to be sure the rift takes people . List of all missing persons in Cardiff over the last ten years . I 'll deal with the personal details , and I 'm sending you dates , locations and times they went missing . And you want me to check the dates they went missing , against negative rift spikes ? Yes , I do , and I 'll dig out any CCTV footage . What about Jack ? Do we tell him what we 're doing ? When we 're sure . Tosh , if we can prove you were right , we can start looking for the people who 've been taken , maybe even try and stop it from happening . Oh , my God ! There are really this many ? Now we tell Jack . Cardiff has an epidemic of missing persons , totally out of kilter with any other comparable city . It 's down to the rift . Are you sure they aren 't just missing persons ? People do go missing for other reasons . No . Toshiko cross-referenced the locations with the rift spikes . Those we identified are definitely victims of the rift . What do we think happens to them ? Scattered through time and space , I guess . Cheery thought , thank you . This is good work . But I don 't know what you want us to do . Find a way to prevent it . Toshiko , can we predict when the spikes are gonna happen ? No . And they 're gone in a matter of seconds . Then I don 't know how we combat them . Jack , we have a duty here . These people are victims of the rift . If they 're attacked by a Weevil ... We can catch them . If they 're victims , we fix their wounds , but this , we don 't know when it 's gonna happen , we don 't know where they end up . Seriously , Gwen . Hm ? Practically , tell me what we should do . We help those left behind . Why not ? It 's nothing to do with us . Move on . Jack , you should see these people ... Some things we can 't fix . So we don 't even try ? Look , Jack 's right . They need counselling . Support . That is not us . Ah , OK , is that what you all think ? We are the only ones who know the truth . We CAN help them . We don 't have to be this hard . It 's not a badge of honour ... ! Close this down . Jack ! I 'll talk to him . So , is that it , then ? We sweep it under the carpet ? " Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change " . Oh , bollocks to serenity . For a lovely girl , you 've got a very dirty mouth . Yes . I 'm with Jack . We did our best . Thanks , Tosh . On one hand , you 've got blokes like Mo , who swears it 's the best thing he 's done in his life . And then on the other , you 've got Big Dave , who says it feels like his life has ended and now he 's a second class citizen in his own house . Although to be fair , he said his life had ended when Susy made him ditch the bike ... Will you just stop wittering ! Thank you . God ... ! It 's not wittering . It 's talking . We 're supposed to be talking . I 've been trying to talk to you for a week and you don 't want to . Wake up , Rhys ! What 's the point ? We don 't need a talk ! It takes two seconds ' thought ! How are we supposed to have kids with my job ? We don 't do maternity leave ! " Jack , I 'd love to help out with the aliens , but I can 't get a babysitter ! " I 'll sort out that bomb once I 've dropped Rhys Junior off at nursery " . Stop dancing around a dead question ! You know , sometimes I fucking hate you ! I mean , look at you , caught up in your little group , like nothing else matters . Like being a hero is an end in itself . It 's not . You save this city . Well done . You save the world . What for ? Sorry ? Why are you doing it ? What are you fighting for ? Because if I don 't ... Shut up , I 'm talking now , right ? You do it so people can live their lives . And there 's nothing more important than that . Falling in love , getting married , buying flats , having kids , or not . But real life . That 's what you 're protecting . And if you 're starting to think that your shit is more important than real life ... .. then we 're not gonna last very long , love . I 'm sorry . There 's this thing at work ... I don 't care ! When you 're with me , we deal with us , right ? Our lives . You got a problem at work , sort it at work . Jack ? Jack , I ... Oh , God ! SHE LAUGHS I 'm sorry . Er ... Ianto , I 'm sorry , I didn 't realise . It doesn 't matter . And I wouldn 't have come in if I 'd known ... Always room for one more . We could 've used you an hour ago for naked hide-and-seek . He cheats . He always cheats . Was there something you wanted ? Jonah Bevan . The missing boy . I 'll make it my own special project , my responsibility , nothing to do with anyone else . I 'm not letting it go . No . What ? I don 't know how I can be any clearer . Oh , well ... Tosh has her projects , so does Ianto . Why can 't I ? Leave it alone . I can 't . Coming back in ? Work to do . Yup . Jack ! We 're not finished ! Yes , we are . Er ... There 's a package on your desk . 'Hello ? ' You still working ? Sort of . Thought so . There 's a cup of tea here ' with your name on it . ' You think this will help us with the Jonah Bevan case ? Just leave it , this is high tech stuff . Sorry , no . It 's GPS . What ? Global Positioning System . About as high tech as ... oh , my mobile phone . What you 've got here is a glorified map . Ooh , X marks the spot , eh ? X being the middle of the Bristol Channel . Oh , no , hang on , sorry , no . Flat Holm Island . Who 's sending you out there ? That 's just deserted scrubland . Could you get us a refill ? While you bask in my technical brilliance ? PHONE RINGS Hello ? You left me that package , didn 't you ? JACK : Ianto ? I dunno what you mean . What 's going on ? IANTO ! Night , Gwen . 'Don 't ... ' Right , so first thing in the morning , we hire a boat . I know a couple of boat skippers who owe me a favour . We 'll head to Flat Holm , see if we can 't sort this out . Or , you get me the boat and I 'll tell you what I find . No boat trip , no boat . I 'm part of this . OK . Brilliant ! But you do as I say . Yeah , course . Listen , I was going to ask - promise me you won 't laugh - have you got any vacancies coming up ? You know , with Torchwood . Cos I was thinking , I 'm great to work with . You know you could tip them the wink . Maybe . Yeah . What can I get you , lads ? Two burgers and two cheeseburgers ... Fifty quid . That 's a bit steep , innit ? Offer him 35 . Gwen , I 'm not being funny , if you wanna haggle , go to Morocco . All right , 50 quid . Open waves , here we come . Get us a couple of teas before we go . You 're kidding ? You 're not kidding . I dunno ... Do this for me and I 'll give you 100 quid . ENGINE STARTS Oi ! I 'm sorry , Andy ! Yeah , right ! I 'm sorry ! 'All right ! 'Who are you ? ' Torchwood , access code 474317432 . I 'm with Jack Harkness . ' He 's supposed to warn us about visitors . ' Law unto himself , isn 't he ? STATIC HISSES METALLIC THUD And he knows we 'll always forgive him . 'In the bush , those that stand out can become immediate targets for predators , ' At late February the population has reached its former strength ... ' This your first time ? We all find it difficult at first . Are you looking for anyone in particular ? Yes . How many people are down here ? Didn 't he tell you ? SOBBING What 's that ? SOBBING CONTINUES Is he OK ? We do our best to help him . Caroline ... Sorry , but why are they ... ? Are you all right ? Oh , my God ... They 're here . What are you doing to them ? What 's going on here ? Tell me ! I 'll take it from here , Helen . It was Ianto , wasn 't it ? What are you doing ? I can explain . No , no , no , no , no , no . You stay away from me ! Let 's go outside ... These are the people taken by the rift ! What are they doing here ? What have you done ? Gwen , listen to me . He 's here . He 's been here all along . It 's not that simple . Open it ! Gwen , before I ... Now ! Hello ? Jonah ? HE BREATHES HEAVILY I 'm looking for Jonah . Why ? Am I in the right room ? Yes . I 'm Jonah . Erm ... I 'm sorry . I must be in the wrong room . The Jonah Bevan I 'm looking for is 15 years old and he went missing from the Barrage . That was me . Who are you ? My name is Gwen Cooper ... and I 'm with Torchwood . What ... What 's happened to you ? I was walking home . There was a light . I woke up and the land was on fire , there were flames , for miles on end . A man pulled me from the flames . Took me to a building , where they tried to work on the burns . I thought I was going to die . I don 't remember when the ground started shaking , and then I realised it wasn 't a building after all . It was a rescue craft . The last off a burning planet . We watched the Solar System burn . It was so beautiful . I am so sorry for what 's happened to you . Can I trust you to tell the truth ? Of course . Am I really home ? Yes . You 're home . Thank you . Jonah , I 've come because your mother is still looking for you . She 's still alive ? You 've only been gone for seven months . She never stopped looking . I tried so hard to come home . I was lost so long . You 're safe now , you are safe . Can I see her ? Can you bring her here ? Is that what you want ? When I took over Torchwood , there were two , just like Jonah . Ravaged from falling through the rift . Being kept in the vaults , neglected . I wanted them looked after . I set this place up . Told the staff these were experiments gone wrong . How many are there ? Seventeen , last count . It 's increased over the last year . Like the rift is trying to correct its mistakes . But not all the missing return . No . You can 't keep them hidden . They have families who deserve to know ... Gwen , they 're sick . In ways you could never imagine . We can 't fix them . We just care for them . Jonah 's asked me to bring Nikki here . No . She has a right to know . No way . She said not knowing is the worst part . How are you going to tell her her child has aged 40 years in seven months ? That he 's scarred , that he can 't look after himself ... We don 't have the right to hide it from her ! If you tell her , you have to tell her about the rift and Torchwood . Then I will . What if she doesn 't believe you ? I have to try . We owe her the truth . Jack , if you 'd lost someone , wouldn 't you want to know ? Let me try . Please . We 've got another meeting on Tuesday . Will you come to that , or .. ? You 're not here for small talk . I 've found Jonah . Is he dead ? No . Is he hurt ? We 're looking after him . Where ? Can I see him ? SHE SOBS Yes . Sorry . There are things I have to tell you first . And all I 'm asking is you trust me . PHONE RINGS ' Andy , I know you hate me right now . ' I 'm hanging up . No , please don 't . It 's about Nikki . I found Jonah . Where ? ' I can 't tell you that . ' Oh , here we go again ! Piss off , why don 't you ? I 've got Nikki with me . I 've told her about Torchwood and about what we do . I need you to confirm to her that I 'm not mad or dangerous or a liar . You used me , Gwen . I 'm sorry . 'That 's how you see me , isn 't it ? ' Occasionally useful . Worth stringing along , in case I can ever help you . 'Andy ... ' You 'd never recommend for me to join Torchwood , would you ? No . Thank you . I want to take Nikki to see Jonah . But you 've got to tell her she can trust me . We can fix this , Andy . 'We can make it right . ' Put her on . Nikki ... Andy ? OK ... .. where is he ? Remember what I said . You won 't recognise him at first . I know . He 's aged . He 's been injured ... I just want to see him . You understand what I 've told you now , Nikki . He 's not a child any more . It doesn 't matter . I have to see him . Let me see him . OK . Hello ? Jonah ? Yes ? I can 't see you . Jonah ? Mum ? No . No ! It 's OK , Mum , it 's me , it 's OK . Stay away ! I 'm sorry , I 'm really , really sorry . What 're you doing ? What have you done to me ? Nikki , I promise , this is Jonah . That is not my son ! Get me out , I want to get out of here . Will you listen ? This is him . You are sick ! Listen ... All of you ! Did you fix my wardrobe door ? We bought it flat-pack , made it together . The bottom hinge comes loose . You said you 'd sort it . No . Every evening you buy a bottle of beer . You let me sneak one sip . Stop it ! You 've two alarms cos you sleep through the first . Make him stop ! You talk about when you can earn decent money and afford some decent make-up . I 'm not hearing this ! You won 't buy me a double bed cos you don 't understand what I need it for . Shut up ! When I ask why you haven 't got married , you say , " I 'll never be lonely , cos I 've always got you . " It 's me , Mum . It 's me . Jonah ? I feel so lost . I 've walked for years , trying to get home . I 'm sorry . Why ? That night . I was late . I 'm sorry . JONAH SOBS The sights I 've seen , Mum . It 's fine ! It 'll take time . Look ... It 'll be OK . You have to leave Jonah now . What ? Helen , I 'm fine . It 's for your own benefit . No . I 'm taking him home now . Nikki , stop for a second . You can 't just take him out . I know how to look after my child . I 'll tell them he 's my father . I can take care of him ... ! We can 't allow that . He 's my son , I say what 's allowed ! Jonah ? It 's started again . What 's happening ? He 's starting the downswing . What 's a downswing ? What is it ? Jonah ? You 've seen him in the good phase . It gets briefer every day . It really might be best if you leave . Helen ... ! Oh , it 's all right , sweetheart , I 'm here . Make it stop ! I ever wish I could . Please , it would be better if you didn 't stay . I 'm not leaving . I 'm not leaving him . OK . Then you should move away . Why ? Will you tell me why ? ! Oh ... ! 'I 'd never heard a sound like it . 'This primal howl . 'The scream lasts 20 hours every day . 'Before the rift returned him , Jonah had looked into the heart of a dark star . 'What he 'd seen had driven him mad . ' They say you can visit ... whenever you like . When he 's in a good phase . Promise me you won 't do this to anyone else . Before , I had the memory . Whenever I thought of him , I 'd see him laughing with his mates , playing football , scoffing his breakfast . And now I just hear that ... that terrible noise . I thought you wanted to know what happened to him . I did . I was wrong . It was better when I didn 't know . Before you ... I had hope . Apology , is it ? Tonight , we talk about what YOU want . Kids ... .. the future , anything you want . Are you all right ? Hey , come here . SHE SOBS I 'm sorry ... ! Do you want to sit down ? OK . Now then ... you tell me everything . From the beginning . There 's this woman , Nikki . She had a son ... .. Jonah . He went missing seven months ago ... Some people believe that in the moments before your death , your life flashes before your eyes . Explosive devices . Snap !

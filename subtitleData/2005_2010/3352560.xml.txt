 Joseph ! Joe ! You 're gonna be late ! Oh , look at yourself . Tuck in your shirt . Put a comb through your hair , for god 's sake . Dara 's son , he always takes care of his appearance . Meager . It 's Mee-gar . Late again and you 're making personal calls ? Oh , no , I 'm ... Who 's this ? Nobody . She your girlfriend ? No , she came with the phone . What are you stalking this girl ? No . Are you kidding me ? Aw , come on . Unbelievable . Two in one week . Your sweep 's leaving , Meager . Get on it ... Or get another gig . Hi , how are you today ? And we 're still on - for the regional manager 's meeting - Oh . Tomorrow at 4 : 00 ? Great . Yeah , thank you . Okay , great . Okay , thank you . Bye-bye . Oh , I 'm so ... I did not mean to interrupt . No problem . Don 't you usually have the little tablet thingy with you ? Yeah . Uh , I usually do . Is there something else , or ... I used to be a webelo . And ? Um , the webelos ... Cub scouts ? Your brownie patch . Oh ! Oh , yeah . No , I ... I actually found that online . It 's kitschy , right ? I was gonna put it on one of my jackets . Oh , that 's ... Oh , that 's , uh ... Yeah , that 's cool . Hey , Bethany , We still on for drinks tonight ? Of course . You better not keep me out too late this time . We 'll see . No , no , no , no . No , no , please . Don 't do this to me ! No . What happened ? Damn it ! Oh , my god ! Do not crash on me . This is not happening . Hold it ! Hold it ! Please hold the elevator . I 've got to find an I.T. Guy . This is a disaster . Oh , you dropped your ph ... - Are you okay ? - Get away from me ! Oh , no . Bethany ? Bethany ! Stop it ! Stop it ! I 'm telling you because you knew about John And you didn 't say anything , so I trust you . At least enough for me to not think you 're gonna think I 'm crazy . Oh , of course not . I saw him last night . You saw john . Yes , in my kitchen . Standing about as far from me as you . Hello , Liv . I grabbed my gun , But he was gone . I know he wasn 't there . Obviously . I ... I just ... Let me see . You fall in love with your partner ... Who betrays you ... And your country ? He dies in your arms . Then he shows up in your kitchen And you 're wondering if that 's grounds To rescue yourself . Yeah , okay , well , we can start with that . I say no . You 're the one that exposed him . Bare minimum , That makes you indispensable . You want my advice ? Next time John shows up for a nightcap ... Give him one . - I 'm being serious . - So am I. You think a few weeks pass And everything you went through just goes away ? Don 't fight it . Don 't beat yourself up . You 're good at that . That 's a character flaw . It 'll get easier . Did she say what it was about ? Olivia ? No . She 'll tell us when she gets here . How are you feeling ? Never been better . Oh ? You look quite the opposite . Maybe that 's ' cause I had a little trouble Sleeping last night . Oh , I had trouble sleeping myself . I was thinking about that man . The one who tortured you . Something about him . So familiar . Peter , when I was in St. Claire 's ... We don 't have to talk about this . It 's not important . But it is important . You cannot imagine what it 's like For a man like me To not have access to parts of his mind . You 're doing fine , Walter . Dr.Bishop Peter . Ah , visiting hours . Everybody put on their best straight jacket . At approximately 10 : 17 a.m. , A massive power surge struck a downtown high-rise in Worcester , Massachusetts . As a result , an elevator on the 26th floor Plummeted straight to the basement . Eight passengers died . Did the cable snap ? That 's what 's strange . The elevator didn 't fall . It drove itself into the ground . That 's not possible . Nine months ago , a maglev train in Tokyo Plowed through a crowded station . Publicly , Reported as human error . In reality , caused by a power surge Of unknown origin . Intelligence chatter speculated That it might be a demonstration Of a new weapon technology . It 's possible that this morning 's event Was another demonstration . To override the elevator 's circuitry Would require a ... a discharge Of immense power And precision . I 've made arrangements for you To be received at the building . We need to know what happened , How it happened , And who 's behind it . I 'm Peter Simmons , the building 's engineer . Olivia Dunham , FBI . This is my team , Peter Bishop and Dr. Walter Bishop . So you 've been briefed on what 's happened ? Mm-hmm . Damn elevator powered itself into the floor . Never seen anything like it . Shouldn 't the brakes have come on automatically ? Well , that 's the thing . They did . I mean , the safety 's clamped onto the rails all right , But for some reason , the motor just kept going . Nearly melted the shoes , which is technically ... Impossible ? Yeah , we 're seeing a lot of that lately . You know your elevators . MIT drop-out . Is there any security camera footage ? Nope . All the cameras frizzed . Hey , can you people move out of there ? FBI coming through . So how could an elevator drive itself ? It 's almost like another generator came online , Jacked into the system , and overloaded it With double or triple the voltage . Exit wound burns . Subconjuctival hemorrhages . All of the symptoms of a classic ... Thermoelectric trauma . What are you two saying ? He 's saying that all these people were electrocuted . Electrocuted ? May I ? That 's lovely . 24 carat gold . Traces of nickel , Possibly cobalt . How are you doing that ? This entire space is charged With electromagnetic energy . Far beyond that which occurs in nature . There 's still residual magnetic energy From whatever electrocuted these people . I need to examine the victims ' belongings . And one of the bodies as well . Are you saying you may know how this happened ? No , not yet . But I can tell you Every one of the passengers in this elevator Was dead by the time they hit the ground . I 've worked on a project where I 've seen this before . The government had asked me if it was possible To make a human being trackable by pigeons . Like homing pigeons ? What possible use could that serve ? Well , I � � m sure it had something To do with the commies . It always did back then . Regardless , our theory was that Human beings are merely Highly complex electrical systems . Um ... Battery , please , Olivia . The heart , the brain Driven by electrical impulses . and because everyone has a unique electromagnetic signature , like a fingerprint , then we theorized that properly altered , pigeons should be able to hone into that signature . Like the way they know how to fly south for the winter . Precisely . But the human field was too weak , So we tried to augment it and make it strong enough for the birds to detect . Did it work ? Oh , yes . But the side effects negated our plans . There was one test subject , every time she hiccupped , the lights would dim . So you 're saying these people could control electronic devices ? No , not deliberately . But I did surmise that it should be possible . Oh . Did you just make that thing come back to life ? No , not in this particular instance . But it does confirm my theory . What theory ? Didn 't I say ? No . Well , someone has pursued this idea . They have amplified a person 's electromagnetic field . And in fact , it is the residual energy from that person that is making this heart pump . And further , it is that person who is responsible for the deaths in the elevator . So you don 't think it was a weapon that electrocuted those people ? No . It was a human being . Accident occurred just after 10 : 00 a.m. here at the Herndon building in downtown Worcester . Hey , Ron wanted to see you . ... haven 't yet been released , dropped 26 stories to their death when the building 's elevator system failed catastrophically . what 's wrong with you ? Investigators are now looking into possible answers as to why the emergency brakes ... You look sick . Thank you , Daniel . Excuse me , Mr. Boynton . Where have you been ? Excuse me ? Do you remember last week what I said to you ? The words I used ? How sympathetic I was ? What did I ... what did I say ? That ... that you ... Yeah , that you were watching my performance . I said you had to stay on the damn grid and stick to the schedule . because the system here , even when things are working , depends on people like you being , at the very least , reliable . I 've ... I 've ... had a really hard day . Guess what ? Your day is fantastic compared to mine . No , it 's not . What the hell 's on your uniform ? - What ? - What is that ? I don 't ... I don 't know . And I 'm ... I 'm not sure . I 'll tell you what . I 'll make it easy . It 's not your uniform anymore . - Get your ass down to the locker room ... - wait . Take it off and leave it there . No , but ... but please . I take care of my mother . Yeah , and I take care of my family . And one of the ways I do that is to employ smart , reliable , capable people . and you are none of those things . Please . You 're fired . Go . Mr. Boyn ... Get outta here , Meager . I don 't want to see you in this building anymore . Get the hell outta here ! Aah ! Here . Thanks . I thought you left hours ago . I could say the same about you . what are you reading ? " Neural distortion in human subjects . " And what 's all this for ? I 'm just trying to wrap my head around an idea Walter had . He believes that it may be a person who was responsible for the Herndon incident . Not a person wielding some kind of device . A person who has somehow developed the ability to affect , or maybe even control , electrical devices . and I suppose the good doctor has a theory how that 's possible . He thinks this person was altered in some way . Extensive procedures . Chemical therapy . What ? In the course of investigating other pattern cases , we 've come across a handful of clinics . off the grid operations that solicited clients by making the same kinds of claims you see advertised on TV at 3 : 00 a.m. Only they weren 't actually providing weight loss or hair growth . What were they really doing ? Have you ever heard of a man named Jacob Fischer ? No . Doctor of biotechnology . Wanted in four states and three countries for illegal human experimentation . Surgical alterations , radical hormone therapy . using average citizens as unwitting guinea pigs . One subject was pumped full of stimulants and kept awake for a solid year . Fed on a steady visual diet of horrific images . I only bring it up because if Dr. Bishop is right , and there is a person with these extraordinary capabilities , it might very well be that someone made him this way . I 'd like to read the files on Dr. Fischer . I 'll have them transferred to your terminal . but it 's not easy stuff to look at . Hello ? Hey , Liv . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's just me . I know this doesn 't make any sense to you . Even if it did , I know you don 't have any reason to trust me . But that 's what I 'm asking you to do . We don 't have much time . I 'm here to help . You tried to kill me . No , Liv . I loved you . You know that . You know I loved you . I did . Always . I can prove it to you . But not here . It 's ... it 's just not the way it works . You 're on the right track . I 'm here to tell you that . You 're looking for a person , But Jacob Fischer is after him also . you need to get to him first , before Fischer can use him . Use him for what ? Use him for what ? How do you know that ? I will prove it , Liv . That I love you . Always . But not just yet . You 're just gonna have to wait . There were weight sensors in the elevator . So just before impact , the car weighed 1,440 pounds . the combined weight of the victims , 1,275 pounds . leaving a discrepancy of 165 pounds . Meaning someone walked out of there alive . Okay . Somebody got lucky . So what ? Walter 's theoretical test subject . I think he 's real and that this might be him . The only problem with that scenario is that it doesn 't make sense . if he was in the elevator car , he should 've been electrocuted just like everybody else . And that 's if the impact didn 't kill him first . Not necessarily . If this person is both the source and the conductor of a large amount of electrical current , then it could well induce a form of electrodynamic levitation . That 's the technology behind maglev trains . They essentially float on an electromagnetic cushion . So he floated . Like my necklace in the elevator ? Um , no , but ... it is possible that he could 've levitated long enough to escape the brunt of the impact . That still doesn 't make sense . If you can sabotage machines , you wouldn 't sabotage one you 're in . Unless it was unintentional . An accident . Maybe whoever we 're looking for isn 't in control of their abilities . Maybe they don 't even know what they 're doing . Then we shouldn 't be looking for big events . We should be looking for small ones . Unintentional ones . Oh , come on ! Damn it ! Just a small discharge . Negligible compared to the voltage coursing through that elevator . I say we need to find this person and soon . Before he finds out exactly what he 's capable of . Wool socks . Charlie , thanks for waking up the team . Sure , look , we got reports of anomalies clustered around the outlying parts of Worcester and the Terndon building . Parking garage , gates , automatic doors , a few cctvs . Well , we need more . Enough to discern a pattern . You know , saying somebody 's doing all this . You do know that 's crazy , right ? If it weren 't , we wouldn 't be looking for him . - Mmm , Joseph . - Mom . What time is it ? Where the hell have you been ? Mom . I think I made a big mistake . You ? Surprise . No , pl ... please just listen to me . Please . A few months ago , I was reading this magazine , and there was this ad in the back about tapping into your hidden potential , you know ? And I ... I figured it couldn 't hurt . So I went down to this office . They did some tests . - Did you give them money ? - No , just listen ... What the hell 's the matter with you ? They put me under some hypnosis . I don 't know . And they ... they said They were gonna , uh , realign the electrical impulses of my brain . Make it mimic a more confident person . Oh ... No , but they did something to me ! They changed me . I can 't remember . And now all these things have been happening . I don 't know what to do . I don 't know what to do . What do I ... - I 'm dying ... - Stop it ! Get a hold of your ... Damn it , mom ! For once , please ! Please help me . Pills . Oh , my god , Oh , my god . No , no , no , please . Pills . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Joseph Meegar . You don 't have to be scared , Joseph . We want to help you . We 're here to adjust Your medication . You did this to me . What did you ... Ah ! Looking for anything unusual . Systems going offline , Random power surges . Hey , I 've got another incident . Hold on . Bicoastal parcel . Guy lost his hand in a conveyor malfunction . Bicoastal parcel ? Yeah . I gotta call you back . What ? Herndon building Security sign in sheet . Bicoastal parcel . Joseph Meegar . she was found dead . A pacemaker malfunction . Olivia thinks they may have found our guy . Yeah , now we just have to find him . Time of death was around 1 : 15 a.m. , So god knows where he could be by now . Ask her what 's visible in the event perimeter . Electronic , specifically . Walter wants to know what 's in the apartment . What kind of gadgets . uh , specifically electronics . Um , okay , there 's an answering machine . An answering machine . - Telephone . - Telephone . - Boom box . - Boom box . - Fan . - Fan . B ... boom box . That 's a device for playing music . Cassette tapes , yes ? Yes , but now 's not really the time . Anything else , Olivia ? Television . A television . Lamps . A lamp . Walter , Walter . Pay attention , would you ? We 're doing this for you . Tell Olivia to come home . I know how to find him . So ... So what is this ? This is the sort of work I was born for . You were hoping for something more specific , maybe ? Everyone has a unique magnetic fingerprint . I said that , yes ? But it is limited . Barely traceable , Except in people like Mr ... . What 's his name ? Meegar . Meegar . But since Mr. Meegar has been enhanced , He 'll give off a stronger signal than your average joe . So what 's that got to do with the cassette tape ? The cassette tape is as simple as it gets . Once exposed to a magnetic field , It remains permanently magnetized . Given the strength of Mister ... Meegar 's electromagnetic signature , Plus his proximity to the tape , I have little doubt That that cassette has been imprinted With Meegar 's electrical signature . It ... it 's kind of like when a film camera Double-exposes a picture . Gotcha . Now we just take out the music And see what we have left . Uh-huh . Well ... Wait , wait , wait ... there it is . That 's him . That 's Mister ... Meegar . Yes . Now to find Meegar . How ? Birds . Wait , you mean that pigeon thing ? Mm-hmm . You believe we can find him using pigeons ? It 's possible . As I 've said , I can program carrier pigeons to track a strong electromagnetic field . We have his signature . Now all we need are birds . I ... I wish you told me earlier , Because then I could 've been working on it . So how many ? Not many . Two dozen . Two dozen . Great . Wait ... where am I ? Tell Fischer he woke up . What is ... what is this place ? Hey , what are you doing ? What are you ... No , no , no ! No , wait , no ... Please ! Please , please , please ! You ready ? Yes , ideal . Walter , you 're not gonna accidentally fry One of those pigeons ? Stranger things have happened . That 's his motto . As I said , Pigeons contain traces of magnetite in their beaks . Like hundreds of tiny Compass needles . The tesla coils will create An artificial electromagnetic field , Which I have already matched With Mister ... Uh , whatever 's unique signature , And will now imprint onto the pigeon . So we set all of these birds free and they ... Fly to Joseph Meegar . Yeah , I know . Me too . I 'll believe it when I see it . Step back . Work to be done . GPS chip 's ready ? Yep . So we 're putting GPS chips on carrier pigeons To find a man who can control electricity ? I have you to thank for that , don 't I ? Yeah , that 's me . No ! You listened . You 're not real . The last time we spoke , You listened . You stay the hell away from me . Liv . I didn 't betray you . You know that . In your heart . You know I wasn 't the one . Hey . I think this bird thing Might actually work . You okay ? Yeah . Hey , Charlie . Oh , thanks . Did I miss anything ? I think the show 's about to start . I know we 've only been together for a short time , But I think I 'm going to miss them . Such majestic creatures . They 're rats with wings . You 'll get over it . All right , GPS is active . Excellent . Then we 're ready . Ladies and gentlemen , Start your engines . Start it up . Come on , come on . Are you sure this is gonna work ? Of course not . Seriously , if this works ... You 're gonna have some more faith In your father ? No . So what do we do now ? We gotta tie the GPS to the mainframe . Genius . And we 're in . And there are the birds . I don 't see them . Yeah , we lost the birds . They 're going northwest Towards Mill street . We 're approaching Mill now . Uh , make a left . Take a left . I see them . All right , we got them . I see them . Glad you got the car washed ? Ah ! Ah ! What is that ? It is unfair . And I appreciate that . The position you find yourself in now Must be so surreal for you . Oh , my God ! What did you do to me ? My head ... hurts so much . Those had to be subdermal . They can be removed later . What am I doing here ? No , no , no ... Ah ! You don 't realize What you are . I 'm scared . Okay ? You wanted to be confident . That 's why you came to us . No , I don 't want to be confident . I don 't need to be confident . But you are now . I just want my life back ! I just want to go back to how it was , please ! Look what science has made you , Joseph . You are special . No . Make a right on Tempest . Take your next right . All right , I think they 've stopped . There . All right , I got them . I see them . Okay , we 're heading there now . Then our work is done . Good luck . Hey , you stay here . Whatever you say , boss . I 'm not gonna ask . Good . What is it ? Visitors . Front entrance . Take him out through the back . Wait at the depot . You 'll be contacted there . What about you ? He 's the priority . No movement . Stand back . Where are you taking me ? Get in . Get in the car ! Get those hands up . I said get your hands in the air . Joseph Meegar . Where is he ? I 'm sorry . Who ? Take upstairs . We 'll go around . Freeze ! Stop ! Joseph ! Stop or I will shoot ! Ugh ! They 're gonna keep him heavily sedated for a while . Don 't want him pulling his whole electro-man thing . Mr Meegar . Miss , no one will tell me Where I 'm going . To the hospital . They 're going to perform some exams . Check to see that your head 's okay . And then I 'm gonna have some questions for you . I want to go home . I didn 't want to hurt anybody . We 're going to help you . That 's what they said . Please ... I want to go home . I 'm afraid we can 't let you do that . That one can go out the back . Thank you , my dear . What 's my name ? Starts with " a . " yes ? Astrid . I knew it . Ah , Olivia . Peter told me to tell you , If I saw you , That he was returning the pigeons . Walter . What 's ... It 's milk . From gene . Do you want some ? I ' ll pass . - Are you certain ? - Mm hmm . Hmm . The color in your face . You 're looking a little pallid . Are you feeling well ? Fine . I 'm a little tired . That 's all . Well , I don 't yet know you Well enough to ask this , But , uh ... You haven 't seemed yourself lately . I haven 't been sleeping very well . I 've been ... Nothing . See you tomorrow . You 've been seeing him . Your friend . John Scott . I 'm not surprised . There is a reason . I 've been having hallucinations . No . Not hallucinations . Walter . What 's happening ? I can 't be sure . The brain is a mystery . But I believe When you were in the tank , John Scott ... that part of his consciousness crossed over into yours . And it 's still there . His memories . Experiences , thoughts . You understand me , yes ? These aren 't memories . He appears right in front of me . He talks to me . Yes , he would . Like a waking dream . Because he doesn 't belong there . There 's only room for one voice in your head , Not two . This is your brain 's way of working it out . Your mind is expelling him . His thoughts . He 'll go away . Is that what you 're saying ? I don 't know . Do you really want him to ? John ? Our team 's still cataloging All the files that we found in the cellar . Apparently John Scott was conducting his own investigations . Did the files give any indication of who he might 've been working for ? Not that we can see . But it appears that many of the cases Were pattern-related . He knew about the pattern . He also knew about our friend Dr. Fischer . In fact , he knew quite a bit more than we did . Including seven other potential Josephs yhat fischer was subjecting to treatments . fortunately , none of them had activated yet . We were able to locate all seven . Medical services is examining them now . But they appear to be fine , thanks to you . Fischer 's still refusing to cooperate , But I suspect six weeks in solitary might change his mind . Well , I hope you 're right about that . And there was also something else . John Scott 's personal effects . It would seem some of them were intended for you . I will prove it , Liv , That I love you . Always .

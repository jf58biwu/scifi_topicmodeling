 JACK : Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race . The 21st century is when everything changes and Torchwood is ready . JACK : Explosive devices . OWEN : Snap . GWEN : Jack , who 's done this ? Captain John Hart . - Jack , what does he want ? - Say hi to the family . No way . It can 't be . Been a while since you 've seen your brother , eh , Jack ? Gray ! ( BEEPING ) OWEN : Bastard John 's taken our SUV . Looks like he 's driven it back to Torchwood . I 'm getting readings of rift activity all over the city . Major rift flares at St Helen 's hospital , the police headquarters and the Central IT server station . - Hey , Andy . - Gwen , you gotta get here right now . - I 'm serious , we need you . - Okay , I 'm on my way , all right ? This is him , isn 't it , this Captain John or whatever he likes to call himself . Rhys , drop Owen at the hospital . Tosh , Ianto , cover the Central Server Building . Gwen , the police station and take me to Torchwood . - You think we 're all gonna fit in here ? - Yeah , we 're gonna have to . Jack , these are traps . So be careful , you know what he is capable of . - What about you ? - I 'm gonna go reason with him . He just tried to kill us . I was the only one who could ever control him . That 's why the Time Agency partnered us . Did you just say time agency ? Don 't tell me that 's based in Cardiff , too . OWEN : Why is he doing this , Jack ? What does he want ? JACK : That 's what I 'm gonna go ask him . ( DOOR UNLOCKING ) ( I LOST MY HEART TO A STARSHIP TROOPER PLAYING ON SPEAKERS ) JOHN : Come on ! Sing along ! It 's our song . We don 't have a song . And if we did have a song , it wouldn 't be this song . You 're no fun . ( MUSIC STOPS ) Thank you . I 've been here quite a while . What kept you ? We all survived . You know , if you 're gonna set an explosion , you need to be more efficient . ( SCOFFS ) Oh , them . They were just prototypes . Had to test out a theory . How are they all , your little team ? What do you want ? Want you to know that I love you . - Funny way of showing it . - No , seriously . You have to understand . I really do love you . 'Cause this is gonna get nasty . - Andy ? - They just appeared out of nowhere , across the whole building . They weren 't human . At least not like any human I 've ever seen . Half the station 's in shock . Four most senior officers murdered . Everyone is running around like headless chickens . Whoa , Rhys , what are you doing here ? This is a crime scene , and a confidential crime scene at that . If it gets out what happened here , there 'll be a city-wide panic . Rhys isn 't gonna go blabber . I 'm keeping more secrets than you 'd ever believe . - Oh , like what ? - Like a time agency based in Cardiff . Oh , it 's not based in Cardiff . Brilliant secret . I ask , you tell . Well done . ( GROWLING ) ( WEEVILS GROWLING ) - Bloody hell ! What are they ? - Weevils , they live in the sewers . Tell me you 're joking . - Don 't mind if I subdue them , do you ? - Be my guest . ( WEEVIL GROANING ) They killed the four most senior officers ? Almost like it was targeted . GWEN ON RADIO : Tosh , report where you are . TOSHIKO : Just entering the Central Server . No sign of rift activity yet . This building houses servers for the military , police , NHS . Even looks after the server systems for the nuclear station at Turnmill . What problem did they report ? - Ghosts . In these server stacks . - How 's the arm ? Owen gave me industrial strength painkillers . Seems to be doing the trick . Ianto . ( IANTO CHUCKLES ) Devils ! Blasphemers ! Pray to your heathen god while in the Lord 's name we cast you out . - There we are , then . - Sorted . Owen , it 's Gwen . Do you have anything to report ? OWEN : We got some activity in the basement . Coming back from a fag break , saw the door open , and there it is , chewing through the cables . So I locked it in . ( RATTLING ) - Okay . - What the hell is it ? Short answer , it 's an alien . - Alien ? - Yeah . It 's called a Hoix . The only profile we have is that it lives to eat , doesn 't matter what . Caught one in Barry last year . In a kebab shop , he went through seven doner sticks in 20 minutes . Now , you got the keys ? - What 's that ? - All-species sedative . Now , food . You got anything it can eat ? - Only these . - All right . Perfect . Wish me luck . Hoixy , where are you ? Come on , porky . Come out , come out , wherever you are . ( GROWLING ) There you are . Look what I 've got . They 're actually very tasty . Get a load of one of these . That 's it . Good boy , come to me . ( SMACKING LIPS ) Come on , that 's it . Try one of these . Okay . You really are quite stupid , aren 't you ? ( HOIX SCREECHING ) ( GASPING ) ( JACK GRUNTING ) Comms and weapons have been removed in case you 're wondering . So no chance of rescue . This is a little extreme , don 't you think ? Oh , what , suddenly you 're anti-bondage ? Why are you here ? Well , see , now you 're interested in me . It 's always the same , nobody cares until you tie them up . Number of reasons actually . First of all , you were very rude to me . - What ? - Very rude indeed . In front of people who barely knew me , you belittled me . I can 't let that go . - You 're serious ? - Second . You have all of time , eternity essentially , and you still refuse to spend time with me . After all we 've been through together , after all I 've done for you . Where 's Gray ? What have you done with my brother ? You don 't realise . Actions , ramifications , ripples in a pond , it 's beyond my control . - Beyond your control , please ! - It is . You need to understand that . So , localise the rift storms , a few short , sharp shocks . - Don 't touch those controls ! - Oi ! I 'm working here . ( SCREAMING ) If you don 't want that again , keep quiet . - No ! - So ... I think I 'm ready to find the vantage point . - A little power and we 're all set . - Hey ! Whatever you 're planning , we 're going to stop you . Oh ! Okay . Go on then , stop me . I hope you can . Really . No ? All right . Let 's go get ourselves a good view . JACK : What the hell are we doing here ? JOHN : Now this is a good view . ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( JACK SCREAMING ) I told you , no struggling . I can make things right with you . You don 't understand . You can 't ever make this right . Attention , Torchwood employees . Evening all . - Now , stop what you are doing . - Jack , what 's going on ? Are you okay ? Jack can 't come to the comms right now , but if you leave a message , I 'll be sure and pass it along . - What 've you done to him ? - No , no , wrong question . You should be asking , what am I about to do to you ? Put Jack on right now . Eye-candy ! That was so masterful , so bossy , so basically powerless . Get up to the roofs of your buildings , quickly now . Spit-spot . - Why ? - Owen . Because if you don 't , well , you 'll miss all the fun . Wait a minute , do I mean fun ? Do I mean carnage ? I get them confused . Are you running yet ? No dawdling now . Gwen ? Where is she going ? What are you doing ? - I 'm sorry . - No . JOHN : Cardiff , isn 't it pretty ? Doesn 't it twinkle so . Take a good look . Remember this , 'cause it all goes so quick . Oh , my God . Gwen ? Oh , God . ( POLICE SIRENS WAILING ) You 've destroyed the city ! Hold me . ANDY : Oh , shit . Oh , my God . What do we do ? What do we do ? Okay , get down there , keep everyone calm , tell them to get every officer in . Run ! - ( SHOUTING ) What 've you done ? - It 's okay . It 's all gonna be okay . JACK : Stop . Get off me ! Jack ! Jack ! Jack , can you hear me ? Are you there , Jack ? TOSHIKO : I 'm tracking a huge rift there , over at the castle . It 's been generated by the rift manipulator at Torchwood . Tosh , Ianto , Owen , are you okay ? Yeah , we 're fine . - We 're still here . - Me , too . GWEN : Good , okay , good . Tosh , do we have the scale of the damage on the city ? Fifteen major explosions at strategic points across the city . There 's currently a surge in traffic trying to leave the city but the explosions have cut off all major routes in and out . Landlines , mobile phones and IT networks all down . TV and radio off air . He 's completely crippled us , Gwen . Don 't want to be the harbinger of doom , but the systems which serve the Turnmill Nuclear Plant , - have all gone offline . - Right , Tosh , Ianto , you have to stabilise the nuclear power station . Make that a priority . - Owen , what 's it like at the hospital ? - Lost all power . The backup generators gave out in the blast . Every single machine in this hospital is down . It 's a disaster . Okay , all of you , listen to me . We 're gonna fix this , we 're gonna put this city back together , we 're gonna find Jack and we 're gonna punish John . Now , I need you to be careful . Okay ? ( POLICE SIRENS WAILING ) Where are you , Jack ? Where are you ? We 're safe . Now , before you do anything rash , you have to hear ... Take us back now ! No way . We have to be this far to escape the trigger signal . - What ? - Look at it . Go on . It 's bonded to my skin , I can 't get it off . Open it . - Whoa . - Ninth generation detonator . You 're a walking bomb . Add to that a surveillance circuit to monitor my every word and action , and he has me doing anything I 'm told . 'Cause if I don 't , boom . I 'm not my own man . I thought you 'd see that . But oh , no , you 're so self-obsessed , you thought I 'd wanna blow up your stupid city . When I could be experiencing 17 simultaneous pleasures in the Lotus Nebula . JOHN : ( WHISPERING ) Oh , no , just run . Oh , please ! That is the oldest trick in the book . Jack . Gray ? I never stopped believing . YOUNG JACK : Gray ! Where are you ? I always knew we would find each other again . I 'm sorry . GRAY : Sorry is not good enough . Get a shovel . This was a targeted attack designed to cause maximum panic . Usual emergency procedures won 't cover what 's happened here . This is where we find out how good we really are . Cover the whole city . Knock on doors , check on people , tell people that they are safe and that it is being dealt with . Get out there and do your jobs . ( ALL CHATTERING ) Bloody impressive , mind . She is that , yeah . Lucky sod . Go ! - It won 't work . - Nothing , sorry . We need to restart the Turnmill servers . What if you can 't ? - Then the reactor goes into meltdown . - I 'm going up there . But , Ianto ... If we can 't fix the remote servers , there must be something I can do onsite - to prevent nuclear meltdown . - That would be suicide . Are we going to discuss it or are we going to do it ? Okay , but we both go . ( BEEPS ) I looked for you . I searched for you for years . You were my first thought every day . What are you expecting ? A loving reunion ? Absolution ? For me to say , " It 's okay , brother . " I forgive you . " Take Gray , keep him safe . I got to go get your mother . Run ! Those creatures , they live to torture . They kept us just on the verge of life . I 'd lie there , hemmed in by corpses , praying to become one . Because you let go of my hand . Remember ? If I could swap with you , I would . - JACK 'S MOTHER : Gray . - Gray ! Where 's Gray ? Where is he , son ? Where is he ? YOUNG JACK : Gray ! - Remember it again . - YOUNG JACK : Gray , where are you ? I believed you 'd come . But you never did . How long before you gave up ? Months ? Years ? - Decades ? - What do you want from me ? I want you to suffer . I want your life . This is Cardiff , 27 AD . The city will be built here over the next 2,000 years . Your grave will be the city 's foundations . Your blessing of life becomes a curse . Each time you revive with a throat full of earth , each time it chokes you afresh and you thrash on the edge of death , you think of me . All right , calling a halt now . Can 't let you do this . - Fill the grave . - No way . Then the detonator on your arm gets activated . GRAY : What 's that ? It 's of sentimental value . ( RHYS SIGHING ) - Skulking , is it ? - Still no word from Jack . Hey . - It 's going to be fine . - What if it 's not ? What if this is how it all ends ? I can 't do this , Rhys . I 'm not up to it . Rubbish . Those coppers are out there now because of you . Even if you don 't believe in yourself , they did . And I do . You 're a bloody hero , Gwen . So you keep going . Because we need you . Will you marry me again ? Gwen , I 've got a rift alert from inside the Hub mirroring the pattern from earlier when Jack disappeared . Do you think it could be him ? I can 't check it out . I 've got to get the Turnmill servers back online . - Tosh , I can 't leave the police station . - Yes , you can . If they need you , we 'll be fine . Are you sure ? I 'll see you when it 's all over . Go . - You took your time . - On your knees ! Honestly , it 's just sex , sex , sex with you . Now ! Hands behind your head ! I 'm going to need a really good reason not to shoot you within the next 20 seconds . - I know where Jack is . - You 're lying . He 's buried alive somewhere beneath this city . I came back to help you . - You bombed this city . - Listen to me ! You have to believe me . It 's Gray , Jack 's brother , that 's been doing all this . Don 't talk rubbish . He placed a bomb on me . Molecularly bonded the detonator to my skin . I had to do what he wanted . Look . He forced me to buryJack and then he freed me . He told me I could go anywhere I wanted . I could have run but I chose to come back here . Why should I trust you ? They were separated as children , Gray was abducted . When I found him , he was chained to the ruins of a city in the Bedlam Outlands , surrounded by corpses . He was the only one left . The creatures had long since gone . Don 't know how long he 'd been there . He thought I was the rescuing hero . So , it took me too long to realise he 'd learned terrible things watching those creatures . He let me trust him . ( JOHN SCREAMING ) ( JOHN CHUCKLING ) The molecules are un-bonding . Just like he promised . ( JOHN LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY ) God ! See ? Free man , apparently . I didn 't have to come back here , I could have run . You find Jack , I 'll let you live , but you better be quick . Fine . Toshiko . I need you to run a trace for an etheric particle signal NME , transmitting at 200 beta-cycles . Gwen , where are you ? What 's he doing ? Where 's Jack ? Trace that signal . We 'll find him . It 's okay , Tosh , I 've got him covered . Do as he says . No signals even vaguely resembling that . No , there must be . That transmitter was guaranteed for five millennia . Through three ecological permi-layers , it has to still be transmitting . If not , we 'll never find him . He 'll be buried forever . ( HIGH-PITCHED RINGING ) What the hell is that ? ( PEOPLE SHRIEKING ) GWEN : There 's Weevils loose in the lower corridors . Stay there , stay there . Oh , my God . What 's going on ? How did they get out ? It 's Gray . He must be here in the city . He said he was going to take Jack 's life , destroy it from the inside-out . A Weevil wakeup call could be just the beginning . Stay there . Owen , Gwen , can you hear me ? The streets are flooded with Weevils . They came out of nowhere . There 's no chance we 'll get to the nuclear power station in time . Manual life support . Get them round the hospital . Ianto , leave it to me . I can get there . - How ? - King of the Weevils , remember ? RHYS : Now push , will you ! Have none of you ever been in a scrum ? Bloody hell ! How many were there ? It 's like FortApache the Bronx , innit ? Apart from the fact the surrounding forces are savage aliens and we could all die , it 's almost exactly the same , yeah . Thanks for that . I am telling you , I have run every scan possible . There is no signal traceable . Then try again , it 's got to be there . Oi ! I 'm talking to you . You know , you got a real pest problem around here . God , I 'm so pleased to see you . Hey ! Hey ! Don 't start . I 'll make things right , eye-candy . Then start by getting those Weevils down the vaults before they recover . Takes more than a bullet to stop them . IANTO : You did what ? GWEN : Ianto ! - I didn 't have a choice ! - IANTO : There 's always a choice . GWEN : Okay ! Can we just get these Weevils into the cells , please ? If we don 't find him , I 'll kill you ! Very slowly ! Whoa ! What 's happening , Tosh ? Tosh , Ianto , my comms are dead . Gwen ? I let you go . I gave you one trip . You could have gone anywhere . A question of honour . GWEN : Gray . You 're Gray , right ? There 's no need for this , we can help you . Just tell us where Jack is . H is life 's mine now . Where 's Jack ? What have you done with him ? ( SHOUTING ) What have you done with him ? ( BEEPING ) What are you doing ? Get the hell out of here . What the hell are you doing here , more like ? - This system 's going into meltdown . - A soldier never leaves her post . Well , you can now , okay ? I 'm with Torchwood and we 're dealing with it . Yeah ? What do you know about nuclear containment structure ? Well , I 'm only a layman , but I 'm presuming if you 've run out of power then the containment structure 's over-pressurised , the containment spray and cooling systems aren 't working so the fuel probably can 't be cooled down , it 's overheating . So sooner , rather than later , there will be a meltdown , and radioactive material will be released into the atmosphere . Yeah ? Roughly . - Roughly . - Right . You need to go . Be careful , there are creatures out there on the loose . Take this . It 's a kind of mace . Sounds more dangerous out there than in here . Yeah , I 'd say it 's pretty much even . Go . Thank you . Tosh , you 're going to have to help me out here . I haven 't got a bloody clue what I 'm doing . Okay . I don 't want you to panic , but the reactor 's already hit the critical point . Okay , you 're telling me it 's going into meltdown , aren 't you ? And I 'm in the eye of the storm . Yeah , sorry . Right , can you fix it ? - Of course I can , I 'm brilliant . - Yeah . I 'm going to try and divert power from an auxiliary source back to Turnmill . If that works , I can talk you through restoring the coolant system . Right , now ... ( GU NSHOT ) Tosh ? ( WEAKLY ) Help me . Please . Tosh , you okay ? Are you there ? I 've heard people say , " Death is such a waste . " I imagine it more as a relief . Tosh , can you hear me ? Tosh ? What 's it like ? How does it feel ? Are you afraid ? Are you sad ? You can tell me . The battle 's done . ( BANGING ) What 's that ? ( BANGING CONTIN U ES ) Tosh , talk to me . I need your help here , babe . ( TOSHIKO GRU NTING ) ( BANGING CONTIN U ES ) IANTO : What 's that banging ? GWEN : Something 's wrong . JOH N : Never mind that . I have an idea . ( BANGING CONTIN U ES ) ( WEAKLY ) I forgive you . How did you survive ? How long since you first discovered it ? Three days now . Just one signal . Regular as clockwork . But I haven 't told you the best bit . - I can track it to a physical location . - Where ? ( TRACKING DEVICE BUZZING ) It 's here . Twenty feet down , but it 's definitely here . Start digging . Please , can we just stop with the questions ? ( CH UCKLES ) We found you in a 20 foot grave . - Do you want us to just accept that ? - Yes , I do . You 're supposed to be out there working for us . Who gave you this ring ? I 've crossed my own timeline . I can 't be allowed to meet myself . A lot of lives depend on this . You 'll be protecting the future . That 's what you 're here for , isn 't it ? And now I need you to put me in the morgue . Freeze me . Set the alarm to defrost in 107 years ' time . I forgive you , Gray . Don 't you walk away from me . Don 't you walk away from me ! Stop . Stop ! I 've forgiven you ! I gave you absolution . - Now do the same for me . - I prayed for death ! Those creatures , the things they did to us . Because of you . The favourite son , the one who lived , who will always live . The only strength I have is my hatred for you . I didn 't know . I didn 't realise until it was too late . I begrudge you everything . I wanna rip it all from you . To leave you screaming in the dark . I will never absolve you . All of it , it 's your fault . ( WHISPERING ) I 'm sorry . I know . I know , Gray . Got it ! ( HIGH-PITCH ED RINGING ) - JOH N : Sorry . - What have you done ? Recall signal . Time for all the pets to return home . What happened ? Where have they all gone ? Abergavenny ? Tosh ? Come on , girl . Here we go ! Right , you 've done it , Tosh . We 've got power . - You okay ? - ( GASPING ) Yeah . I 'm fine . Right . What 's going on there ? Just a ... machine malfunction . You hurt ? ( CH UCKLES ) Who , me ? No , I 'm fine . It 's just my arm . Okay . - I 'm sorting out another painkiller . - Good . Okay . Well , come on , let 's do this . All right . Okay . Oh , God . Owen . - What 's the matter ? - There 's no way to stop the melt . It 's too far gone . Okay , okay , that is not good , is it ? Come on , Tosh . There 's gotta be something , there 's always something . Come on . The only option now is to vent the flow channels internally . Vent them where ? The area you 're in , it 's a containment building . Yeah . You need to set up a time-delay program . Channel the fuel into that bunker and instigate permanent lockdown . Seal the building and the meltdown will be contained within . And , obviously , remember to get out . Yeah , I think I can remember that bit . I 'll open the system protocol . You just need to enter the timeframe and authorise it , okay ? Okay , Tosh , let 's do this thing . And , Tosh , thank you . That 's what I 'm here for . Jack ! Oh , God . Oh , thank God . - We thought we 'd lost you . - Never . - Never . - Quite a queue for the hugs . Always has been , always will be . N ice use of the ring . Thank you . It 's the least I could do . - Listen , Gray 's in the H ub ... - I know . It 's done . Yes ! Rock and roll . ( BEEPING ) Oh , no . Owen , get out of there . There 's a power surge in the system . When that hits , it 'll trigger an emergency lockdown . No ! No ! Tosh ! Toshiko , I can 't get out ! Not like this . Not like this ! I 'm not dying yet ! Get me out of here , Tosh ! Get me out of here ! I 've died once , I 'm not doing it again ! Where 's Jack ? Where 's Gwen , Ianto ? Come on ! You wanna watch the dead man die again ? Owen , just stay calm . Oh , why should I do that ? Where 's the fun in that ? I 'm gonna rage my way to oblivion ! ( OWEN SCREAMING ) Please don 't . Why ? Give me one good bloody reason why I shouldn 't ! One good reason why I shouldn 't keep screaming ! 'Cause you 're breaking my heart . ( TOSHIKO CRYING ) I 'm sorry . It 's my fault . No , no , no . Listen . No , it 's not . Don 't you dare go there , Tosh . I 'm really sorry . What 's gonna happen to me , Tosh ? I can 't . Please , okay ? I need to know . The containment chamber will be flooded with the irradiated coolant . Oh , my body will slowly decompose as I watch . I should have been able to stop it . Shh . Come on , Tosh . There 's no way you could have anticipated that power spike . Come on . Besides , you 've saved my back so many times in the past . Right from the moment I joined . Second week . I had to cover for you . Pretend I was a medic , 'cause you were hungover and unreachable . - What was it ? Space Pig ? - Space Pig . Yeah . We never did get that date , did we ? You and me ? We sort of missed each other . It was my fault . I didn 't ... I didn 't notice until it was too late . I 'm sorry . Me , too . ( BEEPING ) It 's starting . Owen . It 's all right . Really , Tosh . It 's all right . Oh , God . TOSHIKO : Owen ? Owen ... Toshiko ? Toshiko ! Gwen , I need help down here ! You okay ? Okay . The nuclear plant at Turnmill . Owen 's there . Sealed in . Rerouted the blast . Couldn 't save him . Tosh ? Here you go , darling . Talk to me now . Come on . Hey , Tosh . MAN ON TV : And Cardiff City Centre is today recovering from a series of devastating explosions . City leaders say it 's too early to account for the full scale of the damage that also saw sightings of vicious animals on the streets of the city . My whole life I was looking for him . Now I have to lose him all over again . You cryo-freeze him and then what ? Wake him up in 100 years and he 's miraculously better ? 'Cause that 's not gonna happen . Maybe killing him would be the release he needs . There has been enough death . You didn 't struggle when I buried you . Like you were allowing it . It was my penance . It 's not your fault . ( JACK SIGHING ) Need help with those rift predictions ? A lot of this planet I haven 't seen . You like it so much , thought I might take a look . Maybe see you around . I 'm sorry for your losses . Okay . So , if you 're seeing this , I guess it means I 'm , well , dead . Hope it was impressive . Not crossing the road or an incident with a toaster . I just wanted to say , it 's okay . It really is . Jack , you saved me . You showed me all the wonders of the universe and all those possibilities , and I wouldn 't have missed it for the world . Thank you . And , Owen . You never knew . I love you , all of you . And I hope I did good . Now we carry on . I don 't think I can , not after this . You can . We all can . The end is where we start from .

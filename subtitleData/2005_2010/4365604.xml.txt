 Episode 205 : Goodbye To All That v 1.00 Martin Bedell ? His name was Martin Bedell . He was in Century Work Camp with you . Right up until the escape . So I knew him . You knew him . Everybody knew him . But he doesn 't know this one , does he ? Not this Martin Bedell . No , Another Martin Bedell . Maybe it 's just coincidence . How many coincidences named Sarah Connor got killed , before Skynet finally locked in on you ? Why would they want to kill him ? He had experience and knowledge John needed . Military prep school , then West Point . Bedell had real training . He helped John put the Resistance together . There were three Martin Bedells in LA . Now there are two . How do we know which is the target ? They both are . Machines are thorough . Only good thing about them . So it took you , what , 30 seconds to find those names ? If there is a triple-eight out there , he 's found them too . - Where are you going ? - Martin Bedell number one . Closest address . - Without a plan ? - I 've got a plan . It involves guns . Wait . - You 're not going with him . - No . Everybody wait . We thought it was a person . It 's not , it 's a place . It 's a military prep school in Carlsbad . Here 's the student directory . Martin Bedell number two . Maybe we got a head start . I 'll load the truck . - We 'll go . - We will , will we ? It 's a boys school . I can do this . I am doing this . Nothing complicated . Find the kid , throw him in a hole , babysit . It 's as safe as anything we do . Go . Two . Two Sarah Connors were murdered before they found me . Cameron and I will find the other Martin Bedell . Maybe we can stop the triple-eight before he gets to you . He 's not a soldier . No . Not yet . You haven 't said a word since Anaheim . That 's 40 miles of quiet . You thinking or worrying ? Thinking . About Bedell . Where are we supposed to hide him ? Who said we were going to hide him ? Martin Bedell hiding in a cave somewhere might as well be Martin Bedell dead somewhere . No use to John Connor . Besides , it 's a military school . Soldiers , guns , can 't do much better than that . So you own this nuclear plant , Serrano Point ? I have an interest in it . Is this the same company you were referring to the other day ? The one you wanted me to look into ? It is . The near-meltdown a few weeks back ... The news said an employee caused the accident . Mr. Ellison , there are no accidents . Kansas , this is Hammerhead . Do you copy ? - Kansas , respond ! - He 's back . It 's Kyle . - Tin cans just hit Kansas bunker . - Survivors ? Prisoners now . One ogre tank , three monkey wagons . The convoy will roll out down Wilshire to century in the next hour . - And I 'm thinking ... - No . We 've got our orders . Connor wants this corridor controlled . So we sit tight , we observe Skynet movement , - and we 'll report back and that 's it . - What 's that report going to say ? That we observed Skynet move these people into a Death Camp while we sat ? I know it sucks , all right ? But if we lose eyes on this road , we could lose a lot more , Kyle . - If Connor were here ... - Connor isn 't here . Corporal , get below . Round up every tunnel rat you can find . You know what he 'd say . - You know what Connor would say . - Yes . If he wants to shoot me for disobeying orders , he can get in line behind the tin cans . We 're doing this . You all right ? We see a lot of boys like your nephew , Lieutenant . Single mother . Socially withdrawn . Move around a lot . Tend to cling to male authority figures . - Lost his dad , you said , in the war ? - Killed . On a mission . - Can 't tell you any more than that . - Don 't know ? - Can 't . - I understand . Good grades . Good test scores . Good kid . Here 's what I 'll do . Three weeks as a plebe . If he likes it , he can stay . Then we 'll talk tuition . Thank you . I 'll give him the news . Lieutenant . I lost one of my TACs a couple weeks ago . Reservist . Had to go . TAC . Teacher-advisor . They keep the cadets from going all lord of the flies on us . Hired a replacement , but he 's not due for a week . - I 'm shorthanded . - Sir ... Respectfully , I 'm probably the last guy you 're looking for . Guys like you get dropped into the ass end of nowhere . You can handle 30 adolescents for a week . Good news . You 're in . - And what 's the bad news ? - I 'm in . Man up , nube ! You don 't want to get owned . Stop crying about your internet connection , and learn to play . I got to EFK , man . Yes ? Come on , let 's go . Hurry up ! Let 's go . Drive . You good ? You okay ? - Seatbelt . - Who is that man ? He should be dead . How come he 's not dead and where 's my mom ? No more questions . Her current location is unknown . That man is a cyborg sent to kill you . Get your seatbelt on . I 'm familiar with the incident reports , Mr. Nelson . I know what they say . But what I don 't know is what really happened . The people who wrote those reports are bureaucrats . You know what bureaucrats do when the facts don 't fit their checkboxes ? They ignore them . Or change them . So this valve supposedly blew open because of metal fatigue . Sure . Okay . Not likely , but let 's grant mother nature that one . So how in the hell did it force itself closed ? How strong do you have to be to force it open and push it back ? On a scale of one to ten ? Superman . Report says this damage was caused by a transformer explosion . You want to see what the security tapes say ? There are no tapes . They 're gone . That they are . And who took those ? Carl Greenway , on the way to hanging himself ? Those mystery employees who shut the reactor down ? You ask the same questions I would . Putting together a report for the NRC . They 're going to crawl up this place 's ass with a wire brush . It 's going to play hell with the schedule . Schedule ? What schedule is that ? August 2009 . New automated system comes online . We 're back in business . That 's what they say . Of course , that ain 't going to happen if the feds are on a war path . - You jammed ? - Yeah . You know sports ? Like wrestling ? No , it 's a mnemonic . Sports . S-P-O-R-T-S . May I ? All right . So you want to slap . Pull . Observe . Release . Tap . Shoot . All right . Thanks , plebe . You 're welcome , I think . I 'm Cadet Captain Martin Bedell . Commandant asked me to keep an eye on you . Prep you for OCC . What 's this ? It 's a merit ... for squaring away Pyle . And that 's a demerit . Next time you have a problem , flag down a senior cadet or an instructor . You run , Baum ? I love to run . - You look ate up . - Oh , no . This is great . Yeah . Imagine how it 's going to be with a marine DI screaming at you . Like everything 's life and death . I can imagine . That the new TAC ? Good ambush point . In case you 're looking for one . Or in case you choose to jog in the woods . By yourself . You should be careful . Of that , too . It 's tar . La Brea . - It 's everywhere . - That smells terrible . - It smells like ... - Jet fuel . So ... You 're out here jogging , in the open , exposed , with ... - I 've heard a lot about you . - A lot of good , I hope , Sir . Lot of good . - So when do I get to call my mom ? - When it 's safe . - When 's that ? - Soon . Do you do this every night ? Yeah . Well , what happens when you go to sleep ? She happens . Let 's find you something to wear for bed . Something in here should fit you . Try these . This is too small . - How do you know ? Just try them . - They 're for a five year old . How ' bout this ? That 's for playing soccer . This isn 't your stuff . Is it ? No . It 's not our stuff . I want to call my mom . She was supposed to get me a book . For my book report . If you call your mother , that man will use her to find you . Then he 'll kill her . He 'll kill you . Would you like a bedtime story ? We made a tactical error . We should have engaged the triple-eight . With a little boy in the crossfire ? The boy is not important . - Is not our mission . - He is now . It 's just a meet and greet , Sir . Say hi . Ask them how they 're holding up . Then company dismissed . It 's easy . They 're probably going to want to ask you about OCC prep weekend we take the juniors through field exercises . Obstacle courses , simulated missions . Running around in the woods , you know ? It 'll be fun . Fun . Hi , I 'm Lieutenant Baum . I 'm your new TAC . So I 've been told that my job is to make sure that you 're all doing okay . Well , you all look okay to me . So ... Any questions ? All right , then . Sir . We heard you were in the war . Heard you seen action . Yeah . Yeah , I 've seen action in the war . Got a lot of kills ? - Say again ? - Kills , sir . I want to go infantry as soon as possible . Maybe Rangers . Maybe Delta . Best of the best . Best of the best . Counting kills . Like it 's a game . Like it 's just a game . I remember one particularly fun day . A guy in my squad got his stomach blasted open in a fire fight . He spent six hours holding his own guts in . His buddy carried him on his back to the nearest aid station , just praying that someone could put the dumb son of a bitch together again . The game , Pyle , the game is played with your buddy 's life . With the life of your squad . Your platoon . The game is played by you . On behalf of the whole damn human race . Meet my friend , the EFP . He sits in the middle of the road and blows up metal . This is his life 's ambition . I intend to help him achieve it . We 've seeded the street with these things . We got to make sure that ogre cooperates . Corporal Reese will take you and set up over at LACMA and the page . When the convoy rolls to your position , open fire on this bunker . He 'll think it 's metal on skin and move to assist . And when it does , boom . Questions ? Move out . They 're kids . They key off of you . I know . They 're kids . Your uncle ... He 's an intense guy . Yeah , I know . He 's a good guy , though . He 's just ... He 's a lot to take sometimes . All that he 's been through . You know ... - What are you supposed to say to that ? - You mean , how do you measure up ? Every man in my family , going back five generations , has been a General or statesman , CEO , something amazing , they all went here . But you know what the best part about Presidio Alto is ? The cross-country course . You know , sometimes when I 'm out there ... when I 'm all alone , and I 'm going flat-out ... everything just , sort of , falls away . But sometimes , I wish that ... Wish you could just keep on running and never look back . I met this girl over the summer . Her name 's Alicia . She 's amazing , dude . She started at Dartmouth this year . She 's a runner like me . She 's coming home in a couple of weeks . When she goes back , I think I wanna go with her ... and never look back . That 's a secret , Baum . You treat it as such . I always do . I was just on the roof . There 's flat terrain all around , but the woods are a problem . When it comes out , that 's where it 'll come from . You 're alone and exposed here . It 's not good . And you 're gonna tell me I know better . Bedell is quitting . Leaving school . No , he isn 't . He won 't . - Well , he is . - He doesn 't . He graduates . Goes to West Point . Why ? Because the future already happened and he 's just going through the motions ? - He doesn 't have a choice ? - He 's got a choice . We 've gotta help him make the right one . Like everybody does with me . There are three exits within 20 meters , two of them lead to a parking lot , and there 's a black hatchback three cars in with the doors unlocked and the keys above the visor . I do know better . We 're begging you . Be merciful and keep our son safe . Marty , if you can hear this , we 're gonna get you back . - Your dad and I love ... - Turn that off . What were you thinking , letting him watch that ? He wanted to see his mother . You all right ? I told you people . And I told you I had to get it done by Monday . And it 's Friday already . And I haven 't even started , and I 'm already in trouble , and when you don 't do it , the teacher makes you stand up in front of the whole class ! Marty , slow down . You 're hyperventilating . There . Take a breath . Tell me what this is about . I told you . My book report . Book report ? Yeah . It 's due by Monday . And I haven 't even picked out a book , yet . Don 't you listen ? Let 's find you one . There 's gotta be something for you somewhere . It was John 's favorite . Who 's John ? The machine won 't stop . He 'll go back to that kid 's house , - find his parents , find his mom . - I would . The police 'll be there by now . - Police won 't matter . - I know . You don 't need to be here . There are other places to be . You want me to protect his parents ? I want you to keep this contained . Something you need , officer ? Good eye . - Job requirement . - Right . Private sector . Looking into the plant accident . When Carl Greenway went nuts ? Yeah . When Carl Greenway went nuts . - I understand he used to come in here . - They all do . Including Carl . Sit right where you 're sitting . Drink alone . Drink a lot ? Tonic water . Like you , I bet . Was he alone like me ? Pretty much every night . I don 't know why the guy came in here at all . Still , I do remember some hottie chatting him up at the bar the night before everything went down at the power plant . Probably one of Sandy 's friends . Sandra runs HR at the plant . Her birthday party that night , I got pictures . May I ? Find who you 're looking for ? Actually , quite the opposite . These gonna kill it ? No , a speed bump . That 's all . This ... Raufoss . Mark 211 round . Tungsten core , armor piercing . High explosive incendiary . Hits with the force of a 20 millimeter cannon . Saw your dad take down an HK with one of those . He liked it better than his plasma rifle . So this is gonna kill it . Make it stop . Reconsider its life choices . That soldier ... The one you talked about in your story . My dad carried him to that aid station , didn 't he ? Yeah . He spent a whole night in the bunker , gettint the blood out of his fatigues . You know what 's funny ? I saw a deer the other day . Made me think of him . We were together the last time I saw one . - Before Judgment Day ? - No . After . We were up in Griffith Park , hunting for food . It was a big bastard too . Your dad had never seen one before . I mean , not like that . After I killed it and we got close ... your dad started crying . You know , more than I 'd ever heard or seen him . I didn 't know how to make him stop . I buried the deer . We went hungry . He was just a boy . So were you . Yep . I guess I was . You see how the metal is twisted ? You can have the steelers ' entire offensive line tugging ' on that valve and not generate enough force to do that . So you agree it was a machine , as I thought . Two machines . One machine ripped the valve open , and I 'm guessing the other closed it . And I 'm pretty sure there was a fight between them . Two machines . This is new . Where did they come from ? Why did they fight ? I wish I knew . I wish any of this made sense . I do know I 'm not the only one asking questions . The plant manager , Nelson . He wants the NRC to investigate . It 'll be a nightmare . That will complicate our respective goals , won 't it , James ? What would those respective goals be ? I 'd like my company to lead the world into the next century . And I 'm fairly sure you 're an avenging angel . So let 's keep looking . Before the nightmare begins . Last one . Hey , it 's for my heart . You never heard of the french paradox ? Those frogs eat foie gras and gargle red wine , they live till they 're 90 . Yeah , but it 's the chemicals in the grape skins that do it . Well ... Bonjour . Resvera ... something . I saw it on 60 minutes . You don 't say . You 're so beautiful . Sorry , Alicia . That 's never happened to me before . Don 't worry , sweetie . I bet that never happened before , either . The FBI has moved Marty 's parents . - And the triple-eight ? - He 's made no attempt to acquire them . So what would you do now ? In your professional robot opinion . Marty 's trail has gone cold . I 'd switch targets to the other Martin Bedell . So go to the other Martin Bedell 's house . Wait for the triple-eight . When it shows up , blow it 's head off . He can put it back on . Marty likes the crust cut off . Here you go . My teacher doesn 't like us to pick books that have been made into movies . She thinks we 'll just cheat and watch the movie instead . You 'd be in big trouble if you did . The movie is pretty different than the book . Really ? How ? Well , the slippers aren 't ruby . They 're silver . And there are two good witches , not one . And Dorothy 's not 16 , she 's nearer your age . Smart and brave . If that guy finds me , he 's really gonna kill me . He won 't touch you . I promise . Baum . How you holding up ? Shouldn 't you be digging a tunnel outta here or something ? I 'm not gonna skip out on my buddies . I owe them this much . Not everybody gets to run away , you know . Pick up the pace , Baum . I 'm not gonna carry you up this hill . 888 has been to that kid 's house . Knows about the school , has his picture . How long ? Cameron says two , maybe three hours . She 's on her way . You told me you 'd throw that kid in a hole . Babysit . Nothing complicated . It won 't touch him . I won 't let it . You better not . 'Cause if you do , pray that triple-eight gets to you before I do . Is ... Is everything okay ? Everything 's fine . Look , I 'm sorry . I didn 't ... I didn 't mean this . This was never the plan , ever . What was the plan ? I don 't know . You can 't always have one . Not all the time . Sometimes you just do . And I did . To you . Well ... You saved my life , right ? So ... good plan . Thank you . I said thank you . I know . I just ... I haven 't heard that in ... I haven 't heard that . You 're welcome ? Say it . You 're welcome . Now say , " Marty ... " Let me help you with your book report . " I can 't call my mom and ... you 're not doing anything . So ... Thank you , Marty . You 're welcome . Tonight 's exercise is a rescue extraction . Meet old fred . He weighs about 75 pounds , and needs to be carried from place to place . This is his life 's ambition . - And I intend to help him ... - Forget that ! All eyes on me . Seniors ... Get your people online . Ten meter spacing . Eyes up . - What about the obstacle course ? - New exercise . A guy with a gun is gonna come through here . Do not initiate contact . Not even for laughs . Are we clear ? You see him , you send a hand signal up the line . And if I see that hand signal before I see our infiltrator , you win . Exercise over . And where will you be ? Looking for that hand signal . You 're with me . You too . Those are detonators . Claymore simulators . Here , here , and here . Now you wait for the signal . You watch for me to lead the infiltrator past this line . When he enters the kill zone , you hit the detonator , the simulators go off . End of story . We go home . Wait , sir . The last-minute change of mission ? Pre-positioned equipment ? Claymore simulators ? What ? We 're not having fun ? Son of a bitch ! No , no , no , no ! Got to be a little more specific . Straight shot from one of the kids ... Must 've hit one of the FPs . It 's set them all off , a chain reaction . We 're just swinging in the wind . - Where 's the ogre ? - It 's coming to kill us all . - Where the hell do you think it is ? - Where is the tank ? About a block away . Moving towards us . There 's no way we 've got enough powder to kill it . I 'm gonna lay down some covering fire , maybe drop a couple endos . That 'll give Kyle enough time to get back . We can kill that ogre . We got one more magic bullet . We just gotta get it out there . " The Emerald City was soon left far behind . " As they advanced , the ground became rougher and hillier . " For there were no farms nor houses in this country of the west . " Before night , " Dorothy , and Toto , and the lion lay down " upon the grass and fell asleep , " with the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch . " Now , " the Wicked Witch had but one eye . Yet she could see everywhere . " She saw Dorothy lying asleep , " with her friends all about her . " The Wicked Witch looked out with her one eye . " She said to the king crow , " ' fly at once to those strangers . ' " ' Peck out their eyes . ' " ' Tear them to pieces . ' " The wild crows flew in one great flock , " toward Dorothy and her companions . " When the little girl saw them coming , she was afraid . " Come here . " But the Scarecrow said , 'This is my battle , 'lie down beside me and you will not be harmed . ' " Look over here ! It 's me ! Connor ! John Connor ! " The witch got into a terrible rage . " She couldn 't understand how all her plans to destroy the strangers " had failed . " There was only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends . " Want me to read for awhile ? " The sky darkened and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air . " There was a rushing of many wings , " a great chattering and laughing , and the sun came out of the dark sky " to show the Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys . " ' Go to the strangers and destroy them all , ' " said the Wicked Witch . " " But Dorothy they did not harm at all . " Careful and gently , they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried her to the Witch . " " The Witch looked into the child 's eyes and saw " how simple the soul behind them was , " and that she did not know of her wonderful power . " The Witch said to Dorothy , 'Come with me ; " for if you do not , I will make an end of you . ' " The little girl grew angry . " ' You are a wicked creature ! ' she cried . " In her anger , she picked up a bucket of water that stood near " and dashed it over the witch , wetting her from head to foot . " The Witch gave a cry of fear . " As Dorothy looked in wonder , the Witch began to shrink away . " ' See what you have done ! ' the Witch screamed . ' I shall melt away . ' " With these words , she fell into a melted shapeless mess . " The Wicked Witch had come to an end . " Being at last free to do as she chose , Dorothy ran , no longer a prisoner in a strange land . " Six stops down , there 's a pay phone to call your mom . You got your money ? If you get into trouble , you call me . Say " book report " and I 'll come . Whatever it is , I 'll come . Are you a spy ? No , I 'm not a spy . Are you a mom ? Yeah , I 'm a mom . You kind of suck at it . I know . I 'm working on it . Let 's catch your bus . So this ... this is what I 'm supposed to do ? Stay here , graduate , go to West Point ? Like I don 't know the end of the world is coming ? Like any of this ... any of it really matters ? It does matter . It all matters . You believe that ? I 've got to . I 'll see you around , Connor . Yeah . I guess you will . Sometimes I wish I could just wake up from all this . Like from a dream . But I can 't , can I ? You want to know what happened ... To Bedell ... what really happened ? I don 't know . Do I ? Guess it depends on who I 'm talking to . John Baum or John Connor . Baum is just a name . I 'll go . - You 'll never make it . - He 's my brother . You wanna save Kyle or die trying ? Give me the damn EFP . Please . I wanna take this one . Run like hell , okay ? Bedell , you run like hell . When this thing goes off , you pop those wagons . You get those people out . Don 't be a hero . Go ! And he ran . He ran so fast . Fast enough to get to that tank before it got to Kyle 's position . Fast enough to blow it sky-high . We rescued 40 prisoners that day . One of them was John Connor . Martin was always a great runner . But no one ... no one could outrun a blast like that . He died , John . He died for you . We all die for you .

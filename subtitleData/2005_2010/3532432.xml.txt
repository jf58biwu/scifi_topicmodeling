 Target one 's eliminated . Two and three have escaped , but we 're in pursuit . We can 't have witnesses . He gave the order to have Jack Harkness killed . Are you sure ? I 've seen it with my own eyes . ALL : We are coming . We are coming . Whoever they are , they 're coming for Britain . Well , why ? Exactly . Why is that , Mr Frobisher ? He keeps saying the same thing , over and over . We are coming . I don 't mean to scare you . You 're perfectly safe but I think aliens are using you to speak . What do you think ? There 's no such thing . How do we know that the 456 will keep quiet ? We don 't . All we can do , is hope to cover ourselves . This is us . This is Torchwood . This is home . The children promised tomorrow and tomorrow is here . Our correspondents have been measuring the situation ... Le President a declare avoir ordonne la fermeture de nos ecoles . The Senate have pointed out that we are now living in fear of our children . In fear of what they will say next . In fear of who or what is speaking through them . Whoa ! Almost lost my eyebrows ! Still , I 'm good for something , see ? Old Boy scout ! I 'm freezing . Is anyone gonna see us in here ? With all this firelighting stuff ? It was abandoned in the ' 90s . Used to be a Torchwood holding facility , Torchwood one . Been rusting away for years . So what do we do ? Just sit here ? Worse than that , do I have to stay in these clothes ? I mean , come on . Tracksuit bottoms . Not a good look . Jack , they 're arriving today . That alien voice-thing said today and we 're stuck in the back end of beyond . Yeah . But we 're together . The old team . We 're down , but not out , yeah ? We 've survived worse than this . Yeah . Besides , I don 't know how much fighting you should do , in your condition . What does that mean ? Christ . Jack ! He knows you 're pregnant ? You told him before me , didn 't you ? Rhys , he happened to be there , and it happened really , fast . Last to know ! Last to bloody know ! Thank you very much ! Don 't be stupid , man . Hey , don 't be so ... Couldn 't you just keep it shut ? All together . The old team . Tension is mounting as the population of the entire planet waits for the next incident . .. le Parlement Europeen semble fige au regard de ces ... We 've been given no answers , no hope , no assurance that our children will come first if ... The Government has refused to speculate about the origin of the voice or the importance of the word " tomorrow " . Let 's take you live now to Downing Street . In light of what 's happening with our children , we 've temporarily closed the schools . As a further precaution , we have introduced a temporary curfew for everyone under the age of 18 . Keep your children at home , where they 'll be safe . The curfew takes effect immediately and will continue until further notice . But rest assured . We are doing everything in our power to find out what 's going on , to safeguard our children and all the people of this nation . In the meantime , we are asking everyone to stay calm , and to go about your lives as normal . There 's nothing to suggest we are in any danger , and as soon as we find out anything more , the public will be informed . And as always , I thank you , for your trust , and for your faith . Yeah , it 's me , listen , I can 't talk , just give her the thumbs up . She 'll know what it means . WHISTLE Oh , brilliant ! Thanks , Mac ! Mac says , thumbs up , Ianto 's alive ! Is that it ?

I know it 's not your department , but ... NEW TONE I think he was in that explosion , I can 't get in touch with him . He 's got this private number ... I 'll need your name and address . I just want to know where he is . I 'll need your name and address . 'Name and address , please . ' Lovely , thank you very much . Thanks . Name 's Alice Carter , maiden name Alice Sangster , parents James and Mary Sangster , significant because James and Mary Sangster never really existed . They were placeholder names , used in the early ' 70s , for personnel that went into deep cover or witness relocation . In other words , the whole ID 's a fake . Can you find out who she is ? I 'm on to it . Let there be light ! Oh , yes ! Britain 's most wanted ! Hey , how about that ? Guess that makes you an official member of the team . You can stick it , mate . Get on those computers , and get me home , yeah ? I see we 've got a new car outside . Nice , very smart . Where 've you been ? ! We thought you 'd got arrested . Just buying essentials .

No sign of anything . Empty skies . Right , what are we looking for ? Run a check on that Clement MacDonald . And those names Lois said , Captain Andrew Staines . Was it Ellen Hunt ? Michael something . All assassinated the same time they tried to kill Jack . Andrew Staines , Ellen Hunt , Michael Sanders , mean anything to you ? No , nothing . We need to get inside Whitehall . Have you got the I5 software , Ianto ? Yeah , it 's still on the site , why ? Download it onto the laptop ... cos these are not just contact lenses . These are Torchwood contact lenses . But what do we use them for ? Who 's gonna wear them ? Well , there 's only one person still talking to us . PHONE RINGS Hello . Is there a Lois in here ? Lois Habiba ? That 's me . We 're not a call centre , hurry up . Hello ? ' Lois , look to your right . ' Don 't hang up . Don 't hang up . I need five minutes . 'Just five minutes . ' I 've helped you once . And that 's enough . If anybody finds out what I 'm doing ... It 's treason . It 's literally treason . Offences like this can be tried without a jury . They could do anything to me . You said they 're building something at Thames House . We need to find out what it is . That 's the most secure building in the whole country . I can 't smuggle you in ! You don 't have to . Just keep your eyes open . Like this . But ... where 's that coming from ? That 's not a webcam , that 's you . And to the right . And to the left . And back . Where 's the camera ? On your jacket ? In my eyes . Oh , my God . When you wear these , they 'll transmit a picture so we can see what 's going on . And more than that , we 've got lip-reading software . Just look at someone when they 're speaking , and it 'll translate it . Press enter now . Go on . Now it 's working . Say something . Like what ? COMPUTER : ' Like what ? ' Oh , my God , that 's weird . 'Oh , my God , that 's weird . ' And we can send messages to you . Type something . Go on , anything . Hello Lois . You can see that ? In your eyes ? It 's good , isn 't it ? If you wear these , we can find out what 's going on . And then , we can help . But I can 't . What if they ... I don 't know , scan for bugs , or something ? They won 't register . I promise . I can 't , though . That 's putting me right on the front line . You 're the only friend we 've got left . Even if I get into Thames House , I can 't get on to Floor 13 , where they 're building this thing , but Frobisher only takes Miss Spears with him , I 'm just the office girl ! Well , you 'll have to find a way inside . But how ? ! I don 't know , you 'll have to think of something . I can 't ! I 'm sorry , I 've got to go . Just take them with you , I am begging you , just think about it . I 've really got to go . Please , Lois . I can 't . Please . Frobisher 's the key to this . He 's just a civil servant , he 's nothing . What makes him start authorising executions ? What did it feel like ? I mean , getting blown up . It wasn 't the best of days . No , but ... did you feel it ? Or did everything just go black ? I felt it . Shit . Yeah . D 'you ever think that , one day , your luck 'll run out ? That you won 't come back . I 'm a fixed point in time and space . That 's what the Doctor says . I think that means it 's forever . So ... one day , you 'll see me die of old age . And just keep going . Yeah . Better make the most of it , then . Suppose . Like right now ? Ianto , the world could be ending . World 's always ending . And I have missed that coat . Rhys , d 'you wanna take the car and go to those shops , down by the Wharf ? We need some disks for these things . Should take about ... 20 minutes ? 30 minutes . 30 . I 'll go later , the beans are almost done ! The beans are almost done . Bloody beans . Whoa , that 's nice , look at that ... face recognition software . And ... arrested two hours ago in London . Wouldn 't give his name , but that is Clement MacDonald . From the hospital . Could be useful . Gwen ? I 've given her the contacts , but God knows , I think she 's too scared . 'We 've got a new mission for you . ' That Clem 's turned up , in Camden police station of all places , arrested for theft and minor affray . Could you get him out ? How am I supposed do that ? ! ' You were a policewoman . ' Oh , OK . Bloody hell , anything else while I 'm at it ? Fillet steak would be nice . Yeah , don 't push it , see you later . So Ianto , what 's his story ? Well , according to Gwen , it was your classic alien abduction , as a kid . 1965 . He was living ten miles outside Arbroath , the Holly Tree Lodge , it was an orphanage . I looked up the files , the kids were taken away in November 1965 , the Lodge was closing down , they were being taken to a second care home called Harbour Heights in Plymouth . Except , that 's where the records stopped , there 's no trace of them arriving . It was the ' 60s , a lot of the paperwork 's gone missing . But if what he 's saying is true , maybe they never got there . Show me those people . What people ? Andrew Staines , Ellen Hunt , Michael Sanders . Why , d 'you think there 's a connection ? Show me ! No , give me their history , show me them 40 years ago . What for ? Just do it ! Who are they , Jack ? Did you know them ? I never knew their names . Who were they ? Jack , tell me . Did you know them ? Jack ! Oi ! The beans are ready ! Alice Carter . I 've broken the security wall . You 're gonna love this . PHONE RINGS What is it ? Any sign of Harkness ? Sins of the past . Did you know that he 's got a daughter ? Since when ? Alice Carter . She was put into deep cover way back in 1977 , at the request of her mother . Seeking to distance herself from the life of Captain Jack , can hardly blame her . Who was the mother ? ' Woman called Lucia Moretti . ' Italian , Torchwood staff , 1968 to 1977 . Deceased , heart disease , 2006 . Natural causes , that 's rare for Torchwood . 'And now , Alice Carter 's got a child of her own , his grandson . 'Could be useful , what d 'you want me to do ? ' Bring her in . Just the answer I wanted . Nothing from Jodrell Bank , but we might as well get ready . Bridget , get everything you need , we 'll transfer to Thames House . What d 'you want me to do ? Exactly what you 're doing now . Just answer the phones . Well ... I could come with you to Thames House . I could help . I don 't think so . The thing is ... Mr Frobisher asked me to come . When was that ? He said he wanted me . At his side . What for ? Why on earth would he need you ? It was a ... private conversation . You 're not the first , you know . Don 't go thinking you 're the first . Then I can come ? Apparently so . TELEPHONE RINGS Andy Davidson . ' Andy , listen . ' You 're alive ? ' Yes , I 'm still alive . ' Now shut up , I need some help . We need you ! All those kids saying , we are coming . And that 's today ! What 's it gonna be ? 'A spaceship ? ' Aw , Andy . ' Godzilla ? ' Just listen , I need you to release a prisoner from Camden police station . 'The address is Albany Street . ' What are you doing in Camden ? ! Does it matter ? ! ' It does to me , I ... ' Yes . I know , I 'm sorry . Look , just listen , I 've got no ID , so I need you to vouch for me , he 's only on minor charges so I can stand bail . 'You need to phone them , and fax a WC242A . ' Don 't use my name , use Lynda 's , I 'll say I 'm Lynda .. 'Can you do that for me please ? ' OK . ' Like now ? ' Clem ? Do you remember me ? It 's all right . I 've got you . HE SOBS It 's boring . I want to see aliens . Yeah . Be careful what you wish for . Put some cartoons on . BIRDS CHIRP SILENCE Steven , come on , we 're going out , quickly now . But the telly said we 've got to stay inside . Never mind that , now listen to me . We 're going to go out , and you 're gonna be quiet , OK ? Don 't make a sound . Just like those games your gran taught you , remember ? Gran always said , there 'd be trouble . Then do exactly what she said . Just like the games . Nice and quiet . And don 't let me out of your sight . Come on . Clear ! Clear ! Get out of the way . Go on then . Shoot . Let 's see what happens . Are you as immortal as your father ? Is the boy ? We can put it to the test . Take me . Let him go . No . He 's only a child . So ? Alice . If we wanted you dead , we 'd have opened fire by now . Just put down the gun . Who are you ? Put down the gun . If you harm him . I will kill you . Understood . And the knife . Certainly your father 's daughter , I 'll give you that . Come on , sweetheart . Steven , what is it , what are you doing ? Steven , what is it ? What 's he pointing at ? Steven , stop it . Please stop it ! Look at me . Steven , stop it ! It 's them . KIDS SHOUT I charge extra for cleaning , tell your mum , it 's another two quid . SILENCE What is it ? Stop it . Can you hear me ? Lilly , it 's Mum . just look at me . Just look at me ! What is it ? Clem ? It 's them , it 's all of them , the kids . What are they saying ? I don 't know , just pointing . Yet again , every child has stopped , every single child in the world . There seems to be no reports of speech . Only that they seem to be indicating something in the sky . It 's on the news , they 're pointing . I know , but they 're pointing over there . What 's over there ? It says , all the children in America are pointing east . And all the children in Europe are pointing west . It 's us . They 're pointing at us . If you go far enough in that direction that 's London . They 're pointing at London . According to reports , children in London are all pointing towards the centre of the city . To repeat , children in London all seem to be pointing towards the centre . They 're pointing at Thames House . Come on ! It 's happening ! ALARM SOUNDS Sorry , you stay here . Mr Frobisher , you haven 't got the authorisation . ALARM CONTINUES TO BLARE ALL : We are here . CHILDREN LAUGH AND GIGGLE It 's them . They 're back . Come on . You 're connected to them , we need to find out how . SNARLING AND HISSING SYNTHESISED VOICE : ' Speak . ' My name is John Frobisher . Permanent Secretary to the Home Office , of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland . Earth . On behalf of the Human Race ... SNARLING AND BANGING Is there something wrong ? Do you want me to continue ? GROWLING Then ... .. if I could request , for the purpose of communication ... We 've no name for your species . What are you called ? 'You call us 456 . ' That 's correct . 'Then that is our name . ' SNARLING If I could request , on behalf of my government , what is it that you want ? SILENCE Can you hear me ? I 'm sorry , but I need to know , before I approach my superiors , what exactly do you want ? HISSING AND GROWLING I must ask the 456 , officially , your purpose in visiting ... 'Speak . ' I AM speaking ! 'We would speak . ' With who ? 'The world . ' Why ? 'We would speak . ' Well , perhaps we do things differently here . But we would consider this to be a diplomatic liaison . Does that make sense ? We are both , in a sense , ambassadors . And according to protocol , ambassadorial procedure is not made public . You wouldn 't be speaking to the entire population , but to their elected representatives . That 's , that 's , that 's how it works . That 's all I can offer . Is that acceptable ? 'Yes . ' Good . Thank you . 'Bring them . ' Thank you . I have one condition . Does that make sense , d 'you understand that ? A condition ? The 456 have made contact with this country before . Many years ago . It would be better if ... I mean , given the nature of that meeting ... It would ensure the smooth-running of diplomatic relations between Earth and the 456 if that previous encounter was kept off the record . By off the record , I mean , private . Between us . Can you do that ? 'Yes . ' Thank you . 'Soon . ' I 'm sorry ? 'Return . 'Soon . ' I will . Thank you . The area around Thames House is being cordoned off while the Government has ... It 's all kicking off now . Just when we need Jack . ' .. at Downing Street . 'These images are from five minutes ago . 'That 's been identified as Colonel Oduya 'of the Unified Intelligence Task Force 'and this is coming live that 's General Austin Pierce , 'representing the American Armed Forces , 'he 's heading inside Downing Street right now . ' I have been asked to convey , from the President of the United States , his absolute fury . Is that understood ? Very much so . That landing wasn 't spontaneous . It was planned , it was prepared , by you . And don 't go calling this diplomacy , Mr Green ... you have established a court . The sovereign court of Great Britain . In direct contradiction of the statutes of the United Nations . We were acting under orders . Did they threaten you ? I think we can say , the mere existence of the 456 is a threat . Nevertheless , you have an alien ambassador , on British soil . It has to be said , that Britain has claimed no rights of territory or ownership over species 456 . But it 's here ! You 've damned well got it , right here ! And at every stage of these negotiations , you have excluded UNIT . When we 're specially trained to deal with these situations . And I apologise . But the President 's welcome to enter Floor 13 , as is every other leader of the free world , I 'd be honoured . Except that 's impossible . And you know it . We will not move the President into a location that 's had no security screening . That would take days to organise , weeks ! Then I offer to withdraw . What does that mean ? I won 't usurp the United States , or any other nation . I suggest that dialogue with the 456 is taken out of my hands . And conducted by the civil service . They 're still British . But not elected , with no authority of State . And that 's exactly what we need . Middle men . John Frobisher 's already spoken to the 456 , I suggest he continues . I 'd suggest that UNIT steps in . I wish it were so . But the 456 chose Britain . They designated the location . It 's out of my control . What d 'you want to do , anger them ? Look ... John Frobisher 's a good man . And better than that , he 's expendable . So what d 'you say ? Do we have your absolute guarantee that you won 't enter the room ? My absolute guarantee . Then that 's agreed . Agreed . PHONE RINGS 'John ? ' Prime Minster , Sir . 'We 've consulted with the military , 'they 've demanded that from now on you become our spokesperson in all negotiations with the 456 . 'Simon can give you a security briefing , thank you . ' Shit . Oh , but I 'm the last to know . My own husband , and he won 't tell me what 's going on . I 've got the girls , pointing at the sky , and he won 't say ! No , there 's nothing , I 've been flicking through the news channels , no-one 's saying anything ... Yeah , yeah I know . If I hear anything , I 'll let you know . OK . Bye . GIRLS GIGGLE Lilly ! Downstairs , please , I want you where I can see you . The so-called pillar of fire has brought central London to a halt . All roads leading to the river have been closed off , as a result all major thoroughfares have ground to a standstill . Motorists are being asked to stay out of the city centre except for emergencies . Oh , that 's so bloody Jack , you should 've stopped him ! Well , I don 't know ! We 're gonna be ages , it 's gridlock . Bloody London ! Half the people are panicking and trying to get out , the other half is trying to get in . Look , I 'm going to have to go , OK ? Bye . Ey , it 's all right , Clem . You 're safe . You 're with me . You 're all right , you 're safe . I keep remembering more . It 's not just them , up there . It 's the man . He 's come back . After all these years . I can smell him . What man ? Who is he ? The same man . I knew he 'd come back for me . All right . It 's time I got you a nice cup of tea . And a hot dog . D 'you like hot dogs ? I bloody love ' em . I 'm recommending we start at 19.00 . Gives us another two hours. now this is Louise , she can advise on international diplomatic protocols , same goes for Samuel ... There 's a creature in that room . It 's powerful , and it 's toxic , and it 's capable of God knows what . I bet you 're glad to be trotting after John Frobisher now . Stuart 's the linguistics expert , he can help out , if there 's a problem with translation . Excuse me , I 'd better take this . I was gonna phone you . God , I wish I was home right now . Look , just tell the girls that there 's nothing to worry about . Oh , I 'll tell them that , Johnny boy . I 'll tell them that their father tried to have me killed , how about that ? That 's my wife 's phone , how did you get my wife 's phone ? This is 1965 , isn 't it ? All of this , because of 1965 . Frobisher , tell me , is it them ? Have they come back ? Yes . That 's why you tried to have me killed . Along with Andrew Staines and Ellen Hunt and Michael Sanders . All of us dead , so no-one could say anything , is that it ? I had no choice . Well , I 've got a choice ... 'D 'you want to hear my choice ? ' I could blow this thing sky-high . I could tell the world ! 'Unless you get me into Thames House . ' I demand to talk to the 456 myself . 'Think about it . ' The fact that they 've come back proves that they can 't be trusted . You need me . Captain , we have your daughter and grandson , 'Alice and Steven Carter in our custody . ' You what ? ! I promise , nothing will happen to them . My absolute promise . So long as you agree to say nothing . Well , how about I go back into that house , right now , and get your wife ? 'And your children ? ' Except you won 't , cos you 're a better man than me . I 'm sorry , Jack . 'The world is still waiting for any news from Thames House . 'So far , the British Government is maintaining a policy of absolute silence . And the waiting continues . ' There you go . Save some for the rest of us , mate ! He 's your husband ? Yes . Yes , my beloved . Nice house , isn 't it ? Well , we do our best ! It 's got shower facilities . Just stand under the skylight . HE LAUGHS I 've stayed in worse . And who 's the queer ? Oi ! It 's not 1965 any more . He 's queer . I can smell it . If the support staff could take the stairs , the lift is reserved for Mr Frobisher and his personal staff . Fast as you can . Best of luck , sir . Big moment . History . What d 'you think 's in there ? God knows . That 's why we need Lois . No sign of her . Lenses inactive . Two minutes ! Um . I 'm just gonna ... Pay a visit . Online ! She 's doing it ! Oh , good girl ! I knew she would ! Oh , God ! Don 't do too much of that . Sorry . She can 't hear you . I know . 'Is that you , Gwen ? ' Right then . Good luck . Oh , don 't do that , I hate smileys . Took me a while to get used to those things . What , you 've used the lenses ? That 's why Gwen had them . I took them home for a bit of fun . Fun ? Yeah . Y 'know . Fun . Yeah , well been there , done that . It is fun . Yeah . That 's him , that 's John Frobisher . Bastard ! Fat lot of good that is , back of his head , how do we know if he 's saying anything . I suppose it 's an honour . Given this position . Then again the Prime Minister has guaranteed that diplomatically , he can 't enter Floor 13 , so whatever happens in there , whatever goes wrong ... history will say that it wasn 't his fault . D 'you mean he 's using me ? You don 't get to be Prime Minister by accident . What the hell is that ? Some sort of tank . There 's something inside the smoke . Clem , come and see this . Oh , come on . Don 't be scared , it 's miles away . What d 'you think ? HE SNIFFS Anything you 've seen before ? Can 't smell it from here . Is that what tried to take me ? Yeah , I think so . Seen anything like it before ? Never . If I might bring into session , the first diplomatic congress between the representatives of Planet Earth , and the representatives of the 456 . I bring you formal greetings from the United States of America , from the People 's Republic of China ... He 's got his back to us ! Yeah , I can see that ! .. from the Holy Sea of Vatican City ... Need his moth ? Shut up ! .. from the Russian Federation and associated ... .. of Australia , from the provinces and territories ... .. and Japan , and the Hellenic Republic , from the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and it must be stated on the record that any country not named herein does not indicate their withdrawal from this ... That 's it . Come on , good girl . .. reflects only the time span within which this summit has been declared . You 've got eyes . You 've got eyes in the room . Software 's not so good in profile . And according to the rules of protocol , as established ... It 's not too bad . It 's working . You hate smileys . Shut up . I must ask you to state whether these greetings are accepted . Do you understand me ? ON PC : ' Do you understand me ? ' I repeat , according to the rules of protocol , as established by the United Nations in the directives of ... ' Yes . ' Then I thank you on behalf of ... ' Then I thank you on behalf of the United Kingdom . ' Did it speak ? ! It hasn 't got a mouth , it 's got bloody speakers ! It hasn 't got a mouth ! 'The Russian Federation , the Commonwealth of Australia ... ' Citizens and territories of Canada and Japan and the Hellenic Republic , the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq ... It 's bloody shorthand ! No , I can read it , it says " yes " . This is a nightmare ! .. and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . It might be easier if we take those names as read from now on , don 't you ? SNARLING AND BANGING What 's it doing ? I don 't know . " What 's it doing ? " What , is that what it said ? No , that 's Lois , saying that ! Are you all right ? I 'm sorry , but I can 't help being concerned , is there a problem ? 'I 'm sorry , but I can 't help being concerned , is there a problem ? ' Do you want me to continue ? 'Yes . ' " Yes . " ON PC : ' Right , then . 'In the spirit of co-operation ... ' .. we have a formal request to make . We ask you not to use our children for communication . In case certain parties or territories might consider that a violation . Is that acceptable ? 'Yes . ' 'Yes . Thank you . ' Ask it , why it came to Britain . Hardly top of the agenda . Ask the question . 'And , as a gift , and as welcome to this world , ' we 've prepared a document summarising our culture and history . This document can be made available to you immediately . Though its format remains undetermined . Said format remains of your choosing , though this does not constitute a request for information on , or transfer of , specific 456 technology . I have been given a request for specific information . It has been asked ... .. why the 456 chose Great Britain as its chosen point of embarkation . 'We came here ... ' " We came here ... " Because ? That 's all it 's said ! 'You have no significance . 'You are middle men . ' THEY CHUCKLE " You have no significance , you are middle men .

 Transcript AP ... to find the best ideas to celebrate this very special day ? Me ! Me ! Well , yesterday the staff selected the winning idea and it came from this class . The winner is our own ... Lucinda Embry . Come on , everyone . We 'll be closing our dedication ceremony with the burial of the time capsule . What 's the time capsule ? This is a time capsule . Now I need you to put your thinking caps on because I want each of you to draw what you think the future is going to look like . Then we 'll put the pictures in the capsule , and 50 years from today , a group of children , just like yourselves , will open it up to see what you drew . Doesn 't that sound exciting ? - Yes , miss Taylor . Lets begin . That is a lovely spaceship there . Time 's up . Everyone hand your work in . And make sure you write your name on the envelope . Lucinda , you need to finish up now . Oh , Lucinda . The assignment was to draw a picture . This was your idea . Okay , I want you all to finish , please ... Welcome to all our friends and esteemed colleagues . We , the students and faculty of William Dawes elementary , hereby bury this time capsule in dedication of our new school . And we charge our descendants to open this vault of history 50 years from today . To the future and the promise that it holds . Lucinda ! I 'm certain that Lucinda is simply playing somewhere ... Please , help find her . The cloakroom . Check the cloakroom . Lucinda ? Lucinda ! Lucinda ! Oh my God ! Make them stop . Please , make them stop . Caleb ! Take a look at this . There you go . What is it ? - Saturn 's rings await for your approval . Has anyone found life on other planets ? - Not yet . This is just us for now . Okay , then how manys that might have life ? - Well ... If you count the number of stars similar to our sun in this galaxy , then you factor in the probability that they have Earth-like planets orbiting them ... - There are 10 million possible worlds with 4 million mature enough for life to evolve . Why do you even ask ? - Just making sure if you 're listening . Where are you going ? - To watch that Discovery program . But it 's dad 's famous sunday night hot dogs on the run ... time ! I can 't consume that . I 've decided to become a vegetarian . When were you planning on telling the guy who buys the groceries ? Are you deaf ? I just told you now , dad . Off . - No , it 's almost over . You 're not gonna be able to concentrate in class tomorrow . We don 't have a class tomorrow . It 's the 50th anniversary , remember ? I remember . Caleb ... When I said it was just us out there ... you know I was talking about Space , right ? I didn 't mean Heaven or anything . I 'm sure wherever mom is ... Dad ... we don 't even believe in heaven . I never said that , Caleb . I just said we can 't know for sure . That 's all . If you wanna believe , you go ahead and believe . OK ? Okay . Bed time . Hey ... you and me , together . Forever . I love you . - I love you too . I 'm gonna pose a topic to get you thinking along the right lines for your term paper . It has a subject of randomness vs determinism in the universe . Who is jumping in ? Jessica . Determinism says that occurences in nature are causally-decided by preceding events or natural laws . That everything leading up to this point has happened for a reason . That 's right . That 's what determinism says . Spencer ! Tell me something about the sun . - It 's hot . - Elaborate . Temperature is about 10.000 degrees F on the surface . 27 million degrees at the core . - Good . Stacey ! A word or two about the composition . Mostly hydrogen , also helium . With some carbon and nitrogen turning there . - Excellent . Now , I want you to think about the perfect set of circumstances that put this celestial ball of fire at just ... the correct distance from our little blue planet for life to evolve . Making it possible for you to be sitting here in this riveting lecture . That 's a nice thought , right ? Everything has a purpose . An order to it . Is determined . But then , there 's the other side of the argument . The theory of randomness . Which says it 's all simply a coincidence . The very fact we exist is nothing but the result of a complex , yet inevitable string of chemical accidents and biological mutations . There is no grand meaning . There 's no purpose . What about you , professor Koestler ? - What ? - What do you believe ? I think shit just happens . But that 's me . Class dismissed . That 's some very heavy shit for early morning by the sounds of it . Since when does the cosmology department honor my lectures ? Since my esteemed colleague in astrophysics owes me a latte . Er ... what 's on your scientific mind today ? Do you remember Kim 's little sister ? Ph double Ds ... remember her ? Is it ethical to say things like that about your sister in law ? It 's factual . It 's peer reviewed . It 's like ... anyway , whatever . She 's in town this friday . - Okay . And she thinks that you 're intriguing which I thought was code for " gay " but apparently not cause she 's asked if you would join us for dinner . - I ... I don 't know . - Oh , come on , John . Come on ! You owe me for last time you skipped out on me . - Caleb was panicking ... - Yeah , look , I know . And the time before that he had a sore throat . - Oh , no ! Damn it ! Damn it ! - What ? - Caleb 's ceremony . I 'm sorry , Phil . Hey ! Hey ! Friday ! - I 'll think about it . 50 years ago the students and faculty of William Dawes elementary imagined what the future might hold . Today we unveil their legacy . Now I 'd like to introduce you to someone very special . Miss Priscilla Taylor . Since miss Taylor was there for the original dedication , it 's only fitting that we have her do the honors today . You almost forgot again . - Made it in time to hear you sing . You were the best one up there . - You could not hear it . I could . I swear . Gotta go . It 's starting ! Easy , don 't push it . - Everyone is going to receive an envelope . Open them gently now . It 's really old . Lucinda Embry Hey , what did you get ? Boring ! Everyone else got a picture . Caleb , could you please watch where you put this ? I don 't want you to lose another one . - It 's making funny noises . - Try turning the volume down . Hey dad , remember that kid Jason from soccer practice ? He 's having a sleepover this weekend . And he was wondering if I can come . - Sounds like fun . They have a boat . Jason 's dad said he even might take us out on the lake . - I 'll think about it . - That means no . It means I 'll think about it . What are you doing with this ? You 're not supposed to bring this home . It belongs to the school . But maybe it means something . Like a map or sorta something like that . Yeah , that 's good , I don 't know , but it 's not ours to keep . You 'll return this as soon as you get to school tomorrow . Got it ? Now lets go . Bed time . Good night , baby . Good night , mom . Nine eleven 01 ? In memory of the 2996 lives that were lost that day . - 2996 . C 'mon ! What the hell is this ? Dad ! Dad , we 're gonna be late ! Thanks for the ride , mr Koestler ! Dad , are you sick ? - I am fine . Don 't you think you 're acting kinda awkward today ? Am I awkward ? I just had a lot of work to do last night . Okay . Bye , dad ! Bye . Look at this . Look at the numbers beside the dates . 2996 . That 's how many people died in the attacks that day . Stay with me . I know how this sounds , but I 've matched these numbers to the dates of every major global disaster for the last 50 years in perfect sequence . Except for 3 , and these events haven 't occured yet , starting with this one . So , tomorrow , somewhere on the planet , this number string predicts that 81 people are gonna die ... in some kind of tragedy . Whoa . Have you listened to yourself ? - I know . It sounds pretty crazy . - I know . - I mean ... even for you . What 's this ? - Open it . Why are you showing me this ? The day Allison died in the fire . It 's on the list too . On the piece of paper that 's been buried in the ground for 5 decades . Can you explain that , Phil ? I was up all night going over this . I went through that list again and again and I tried to fault it . And I couldn 't . - Maybe someone 's playing a really shitty joke . - Right ! Right ! Except I saw them dig it up ! I watched them pull the capsule out of the ground and hand that sealed envelope to my kid . - OK . Let me ask you this then . All these uncircled numbers ? What do they mean ? I don 't know yet . Maybe nothing ... - Maybe they all mean nothing . Phil , hey , can we just start over ? I 'm not saying that 81 people are gonna die tomorrow , okay ? I 'm just trying to understand why this is saying they will ! Okay ! It 's spooky . I 'll grant you , it 's more than spooky . But just step back , alright ? You have all these uncircled numbers with no sequence to them . Numerology , Kabbalah , Pythagorean cults ... There are systems that find meaning in numbers . But they are a dime a dozen . Why ? Because people see what they want to see in them . That 's really what you think I 'm doing ? Yeah , I think that losing Allison has spun you off your axis a little . And I think it has clouded your judgement . I 'm just saying it has clouded your judgement . Don 't you think ? Where are you going ? - Off campus . Yes ? You do remember her ? - Oh yes . I remember Lucinda . She was such a sad little girl . Would you like some iced tea ? - Oh , no , no , thank you . Do you remember the day your students buried the time capsule ? Oh yes ! The children were so excited . And what about Lucinda ? Later that day we couldn 't find her . She was hiding in the closet under the gym . Scratching at the door with her fingernails like some kind of animal . Scratching at the door ? Why was she hiding ? - I 'm not sure . She was holding up the class . Writing all those silly numbers . I had to hurry her along . Then we found her . And I knew something had frightened the poor dear . But we never could get her to tell us what it was . Miss Taylor , my son got Lucinda 's time capsule message . Do you remember this ? Is this what she wrote ? Oh , professor , you are testing an old woman 's memory . Can you believe it 's been 50 years ? - It 's a long time . I believe that 's it . Oh , how rude of me . I never offered you a drink . Would you like some iced tea ? - No , thank you . I 'm fine . I thought maybe I could meet her . I 'm sorry . Lucinda passed away several years ago . I said I 'm Caleb Koestler 's father . I 'm calling to find out the names of the two janitors that pulled the time capsule out of the ground yesterday at the ceremony . I 'm not sure I understand why that would be a problem for you . Caleb ! Who was that ? - I don 't know . Just some guys . - What did they give you ? - Just this . Kinda cool , isn 't it ? What did I say about talking to strangers ? Have you done your homework ? - I need 10 more minutes of practice . I don 't want to have to ask you twice , Caleb . Hey , stranger ! - At what age do we learn to knock ? I said I was gonna drop by . On my way to graveyard shift , remember ? Didn 't you get my message ? - I 've been busy . Do not play with my things . - You 're always busy . Yes ! Yes . How 's my nephew ? - He 's become a vegetarian . - A what ? - Why ? You got a problem with that ? You 're not feeding him dad 's famous sunday night hot dogs again , are you ? You know , if you want someone to take him off your hands for the evening so you can go out , you know , like normal people do ... I appreciate the offer , but we 're fine . And believe it or not , Caleb and I have got a good thing going there . So , you can report that back to headquarters . Mom says hi . So does dad . Grace ! Don 't . I get that you don 't like being the son of a pastor . - I am the son of a pastor . - That 's fine . You 're still his son . Can 't you let it go ? - Can 't he ? He asks after you every time I see you . He worries about you . - He said that ? - He doesn 't have to . - Right . You 're gonna have to speak to him one day , you know . This can 't go on forever . You know it 's what Allison wanted . For Caleb to have a grandfather . And vice versa . Okay . I 'm going . I 'm going . By the way , Grace , how are you ? How 's your life ? What 's going on for you ? Thank you , John , for asking . I have to get up early in the morning . What do you have going on ? I 'll say a prayer . - Please don 't . - Okay . Experts say solar flairs this weekend may interrupt cell phone communications . - Experts ... The price of oil may hit another record . Another fire burns out of control in the Gulf . Eighty one . An explosion on a soon to be decommissioned oil rig triggered a fire which burned for 3 hours before it was extiguished . Officials don 't yet know the exact cause of the explosion , but believe a malfunction in the cooling system may 've been at fault . Due to the prompt response of the rescue unit , the structure was evacuated with no loss of life . Farmers across the Midwest and here 's Karl Witherman . Looks like a scorch is on the wind . That 's right , Bob . The forecast shows more high pressure moving in later this week . It seems our indian summer is set to last a little while longer ... Hallo . - Dad , where are you ? You 're on the car pool this afternoon . Caleb , I 'm so sorry . I 'll pick you up in ten minutes , okay ? - Okay . Bye . William Dawes elementary school . Alternate routes : no alternate routes available . This is Phil and Kim . We can 't get to the phone right now . Please leave the message . - Hey , Phil , it 's John . I am sorry about yesterday . I kind of freaked out on you , didn 't I ? Look , I 'm not ready to meet anyone in any kind of special way . But I would like to take you up on your offer for dinner . I think it would be good for me to just get out of the house and ... The uncircled numbers are locations . This location . What 's going on ? Do we get through or what ? Hi ! Is everything okay ? I 'm sorry sir , but you need to get back to your car . - Anybody hurt ? - A couple of injuries , but nothing serious . Get down ! Hey ! Hey ! Help me ! Please ! Help me ! Help me ! Please ! - Are you okay , sir ? - Step back , sir . Step away . ... one of the worst days in recent US aviation history when four planes crash-landed across as many states , from Maine to Miami . Can you go upstairs while I talk to your dad ? You didn 't tell him anything ? - Of course not . First estimates put the presumed dead at 81 . We need to talk . I just ... I just wanna sleep . What happened , dad ? What 's going on ? My car broke down on the highway . It 's more than that , isn 't it ? I 'm going to bed . Get your homework done . Then you should go to bed too . No TV tonight . Why ? I always watch an hour of TV . - No more questions , Caleb . I can ask questions when you tell me things that don 't make sense . You won 't let me play soccer , you won 't let me stay over at Jason 's and now you won 't tell me what 's going on and why you 're acting so weird all the time ? I 'm not a kid anymore . Oh my God ! John ! You were there ? The date , the number of dead , the GPS coordinates . Latitude and longitude . Why didn 't I see that ? It wasn 't a coincidence . I drove past at the exact moment the prediction came true . It 's not a coincidence . - OK , John , I didn 't say it was . So , what are we calling this ? Synchronicity ? Two unrelated events , digging up time capsule , plane crash ... combine to create a significance with the subject , you ? I keep seeing their faces . Burning ... Oh , man ... Okay , look . We are way beyond the boundaries here , John . We don 't have a frame of reference . There could be multiple meanings to consider . There are two disasters left . What are you saying ? Numbers are warnings meant for me . They might just as easily be a warning to stay away . You could 've been killed today , John . Caleb would 've been orphan , and you wanna go put yourself back in harm 's way ? Two disasters left . Right now my scientific mind is telling me to have nothing more to do with this . And yours should too . Caleb ! It 's all right . - Dad ! It 's okay . It 's okay . It was just a bad dream . Just a bad dream . Hey ! Hey ! You stay away from us , you hear ? ! Want some of this ? ! Caleb , why don 't you check out the animals ? I 'll catch up with you , okay ? - Okay . Do you know that all wolves are born deaf ? - Really ? Did you know that when they get older , they can hear another wolf 's howl from ten miles away . - Wow . How do you know that ? - I read it in National Geographic . Hi . - Hi . Is that your daughter ? Yeah , why ? - Why ? Uh ... that 's my son . And they look like they are already best friends . Yeah , Abby is probably telling him about the animals . Even as a baby she was completely fascinated with them . Yeah , he 's the same . He likes extinct animals . I 'm John . Hi , Diana . What are they doing now ? Caleb is showing her something in sign language . - I 'm sorry , I didn 't realise ... - He 's not . His sounds just ... get jumbled up sometimes . He has a hearing aid which helps , but he 's not deaf . He is an expert in sign language . It 's very hot in here . Air conditioning must be out . Dad , can we get a drink ? - Can we get one too ? Hey , would you and Abby like to join us ? Sure , that 'd be nice . Abby , this is John . - Hi . - Hey , Abby . It can be tough sometimes , cause , you know , I 'm by myself . - I know how you feel . - You 're a single parent too ? Yeah . I left him years ago . He couldn 't keep his hands to himself so I decided he couldn 't keep me to himself either . Well , it is ... it 's his loss . And you ? You 're separated ? Diana ... We didn 't meet here by accident . I need to talk to you about something . Ask you something about your mother . My mother ? What about my mother ? Did she have some kind of ability ? - Ability ? A gift of some kind ? Who are you ? - Yeah , it 's awkward , you don 't know me . I 'm John Koestler , I teach astrophysics at M.I.T. My son goes to William Dawes elementary which is the same school your mother went to . 50 years ago , she put this in a time capsule . It 's a list of dates , events that , I think , she believed would happen . Look , I don 't what any of this is about . I thought if I could talk to you or your father ... - My father is dead . I think it 's possible that there are people like your mother , Lucinda , who can see things before they occur . Abby , we 're leaving ! Honey ! I followed on your mother 's predictions , and I watched 81 people burn to death in that plane crash yesterday . When she said it would happen . Where she said it would happen . And there was nothing I could do about it . She says 170 people will die tomorrow in New York City . And in 3 days time , october 19th , 33 more . Stay away from me . And my daughter . Abby ! Lets go , honey . C 'mon . Stay right there . Diana ! Diana , I think this has something to do with my son . I don 't know how or why , but I think he 's in danger . So I 'm asking you please , please help us . I can 't . ... possible terrorist plot . The department of Homeland Security raised the national threat level from elevated to high , after intelligence report suggested that an attack on the major East Coast city may be imminent . Police have urged citizens to stay vigilant . FBI New York . How may I direct your call ? The attack will take place tomorrow at the corner of Lafayette and Worth streets . Corner off the area after midnight . Are you clear on that ? Sir , let me pass you through to our ... Please ! Do exactly as I say or many people will die . This is not a crank call . You said you 'd take him off my hands . I know there 's something you 're not telling me . Don 't let him watch the news . Why hasn 't this intersection been sealed off ? - Excuse me ? I said why hasn 't this intersection been sealed off ? Sir ... please calm down . If you 'll accompany me , we 'll get this matter taken care of . Sir ! Stop ! Out of the way ! Let me through ! Get off the train . - Why ? What is wrong ? Just take the baby and get off . - What 's your problem , pal ? Hold it right there , sir . Transit police ! I 'm asking you to stop ! That 's him ! You have to stop him ! Transit police ! Turn around ! Now ! Get your hands up ! Please ! Please , I won 't do it again , I promise . I 'll give it back ! I 'll give it back ! Move back ! Move back ! Federal Aviation Administration official said that it 's possible that an electrostatic burst might have caused the Lexington air disaster of two days ago . NOAA , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , remained silent tonight . But with the devastating subway crash in Manhattan , power cuts in Long Island ... Grace , I got held up by work . I 'll be over in 30 minutes . No , I 'm fine . I 'll see you in 30 minutes . Caleb , go inside . Hey ! - Hey . Wanna check out the house ? - Sure . You said october 19th ? My mother used to talk about that day all the time . She said that was the day I was gonna die . All my life I 've had this thing hanging over my head . And Abby 's . I just don 't believe that anyone can predict my future . And what does it matter anyway ? We all die in the end . I don 't wanna know what my future holds . Last year my wife was on a business trip to Phoenix . Couple of days before my birthday , and ... a fire started in her hotel at four in the morning . The investigator said that Allison died of smoke inhalation . Died in her sleep . She wouldn 't have known anything about it . While she was dying , I was at home , in the front yard . I always thought you 're supposed to sense when the people you love are in danger . I didn 't feel anything . Nothing . I was just ... blowing leaves off the lawn . I 'm so sorry , John . My point is that from then on , I decided ... that no one can know what was coming . And life is just a ... string of random accidents and mistakes . And then I got that list . If that had come to me before Allison left , I would 've saved her life . I need to know . It 's still here . What 's this ? Have you seen this ? Abby used to do this sometimes . Write things backwards . That last number . I don 't think it 's 33 . It 's EE . EE ... initials . Someone she knew ? I don 't know . I was nine when she overdosed . The only time I ever came in here was with my father . We identified her body . She willed the property to me , but ... I never came back for any of her things . When I was little , my mother used to tell me that she could hear voices . Whispering to her . Telling her horrible things . Then one day my dad came and took me away from her . He said she was sick . She said she moved out here to get ready . I never knew what she meant by that . I 've made this for her one Christmas . I never knew she kept it . She used to stare at this picture for hours . That 's where they found her . In there . Have you seen enough ? Yeah . Okay , we 'll go . Abby ? Abby ! EE isn 't just one person . everyone else Abby , no ! What ? What ? ! It 's okay ! It 's okay . They were here . Who ? Who was here , Caleb ? Did they hurt you ? No . They were talking to us . - What did they say ? I don 't know . They were all talking at once . They said we can go with them . If we chose to . Who did ? Abby , who ? The whisper people . Hey ! Lock the doors . What do you want with my son ? Answer me ! I just know they 've been following us for days . I think someone 's been following me and Abby too . That 's why she didn 't write any coordinates down after the final date . There isn 't a single location this time . Are you telling me that my mother could see the end of everything ? That we 're all gonna die tomorrow ? She was disturbed , John . She could 've just made it all up . - She 's been right so far , Diana . About everything . Abby is all I 've got , John . I can 't let anything happen to her . Caleb , you really need to sleep . I can hear them whispering to me sometimes like Abby can . Could Lucinda hear them too ? Yeah I think she did , yes . Are me and Abby gonna die ? No . I will never let that happen , Caleb . Do you hear me ? Never . You and me ... together . Forever . Abby , what do you like to eat for breakfast ? Abby ? What are you doing , honey ? It 's the sun . There 's something I need to check . Get Abby , you 're coming with us . Caleb ! Hey , John , what happened ? Hey ! Talk to me ! What happened ? I 've been calling you off the hook ever since I 've heard about the subway . John ... Do you remember that paper on extrasolar activity I published ? - Yeah , sure I remember . - I found evidence of the series of superflairs from the star in the Pleiades . Right . Readings were off the chart . We were both wrong . The numbers are a warning , but not just to me or any random group . They are a warning to everyone . Okay , you 're officially scaring the shit out of me right now . The superflair . In our own Solar System . 100 microtesla wave of radiation that will destroy our ozone layer . Killing every living organism on the planet . We have to let everyone know . We have to call the NOAA ... They already know . The announcement will come any time now . I thought there was some purpose to all of this . Why did I get this prediction when there 's nothing I can do about it ? How am I supposed to stop the end of the world ? Go home , Phil . Be with Kim tonight . Diana ... It 's so stupid . I spent my whole life knowing that she was right , and pretending that she was insane . If we hide underground we got a chance , don 't we ? It 's possible . I know some caves . Off route 40 , past Groton . Hardly anyone knows about them . I used to play there as a child . We could try there , right ? Okay . - Okay . Caleb , put some clothes and shoes into your backpack . Diana , load all the non-perishable food , any water you can into the truck . Lets try to be outta here in 10 minutes . Allison wanted me to call you . The day she left for Phoenix she wanted me to promise her that I 'll call you . I know , John . We haven 't spoken in so long . I don 't really even know why anymore . I need to tell you something . Yes ? That sermon you preached every year at Pentecost , about the gifts of the spirit ? One was the gift of prophecy . 1 Corinthians 12 . Yes , I remember . The Church should respect the prophets . I have a prophecy . It 's about to be proven accurate . I need you to respect it and receive it as the truth . This heat we 're experiencing isn 't gonna get better . It 's gonna get worse . Much worse . I need you to get mom and Grace , and any supplies you can , and get below ground tonight . The basement , the sewer , just get as deep as you can and as fast as you can . And that will keep us safe from this heat ? I don 't know , dad . But we have to try , right ? I 'm sorry , John , but I 'm afraid I 'm not going anywhere tonight or any night . I appreciate your concern , but if it is my time , it 's my time . I 'm ready whenever the good Lord calls me . And you ... - Dad ? John ? - Dad ! Caleb , lets go ! Caleb ? Caleb ! Caleb ! Caleb , stop ! What were you doing ? Did I do that ? This isn 't the way to the highway . Everybody wait here . John ! John ! John ! Please ! Why are we back here ? John , please . What are you doing ? We have to get to the caves . We 're not going to the caves . - What ? - She knew the coordinates for this last event . She tried to write them down . Teacher said she was interrupted . Ran out of time . So she scratched them into this door . She tried to tell us where to go . You 're not making any sense . Look at you . Look at what you 're doing . The numbers are the key . To everything . Please ! Please , John , we need to leave ! We 're taking my car . C 'mon . Lets go . Take your things with you . They are here . They better be here . Throw them in the back . What about dad ? - He is just gonna finish what he 's doing . He 's gonna follow us . We 're getting a head start , okay ? Diana ! Caleb ! Caleb ! Caleb ! Where are we going , mom ? Are we hiding from the whisper people ? - Yes , my baby . They won 't find us where we 're going . Mom , they know where we are . How do you know that ? - They told us so . You 've seen them again ? No . They just talk to us . How , Abby ? How do they talk to you ? They whisper into our heads . Oh , God ... I wanna call my dad . - The phones are down ! I promise he 's right behind us . We 'll call him when we get there ! Stay right here . Number 5 . This is an emergency broadcast transmission . This is not a test . This is an emergency broadcast transmission . Turn that up ! ... lasted longer and caused more damage to our infrastructure than we originally thought . We 're recommending that people stay indoors until further notice . Get your pets inside , stock up on extra water , and if possible seek out 4-5 feet underground shelter . Where is the President ? - The President and his staff are currently to be transported to a secure location . Hello ? - Dad ! Caleb ! Are you okay ? Tell me exactly where you are . We are at the gas station . I don 't know where . The damage information regarding the distructing power of flairs ... Caleb , get back to the car , now ! John ? - Where are you ? - We 're in Westford . I 'm sorry , I had to do this for Abby and for Caleb . I 'm taking them to the caves . I 've found the numbers ! They are the location of your mother 's mobile home . That 's where we gotta go ! - Don 't do this to me . Please . - I know how it sounds . You want us to head towards the place where this is supposed to happen ? Are you insane ? It 's the kids we gotta take , or we 're all gonna die ! Stay where you are . I 'll be right there . No ! If we go to the caves , we have a chance . You said the sun can 't reach that far . The caves won 't save us ! Nothing can ! The radiation will penetrate a mile into the Earth 's crust ! Do you hear me ? Our only chance is to go where your mother told us to go ! No ! I don 't believe you ! I 'm taking the children . We have to save the children ! That isn 't your call , Diana . Caleb is my son ! Diana ! Caleb ! Are you there ? Abby ! Abby ! They took my daughter ! Abby ! Damn it ! Where did she go ? Same thing happened with Y2K . They are gonna wake up tomorrow morning , feeling pretty stupid . 20 minutes ago there was a woman here , she was screaming ! She was with a kid . He was on your payphone . A nine year old kid ! Some guy took the lady 's car with the kids inside . Drove right off . - The woman , where did she go ? - That way . Stop that ! You gotta pay for it ! Where are the children ? - We can 't help you now , sir . Charge . Clear . Again . Clear . - You can call it . - 12 midnight , exactly . There 's a man down . We need help . Diana ... I 'm sorry . Caleb ! Where is he ? Where is Caleb ? I want my son ! I want my son ! Now ! Dad , dont ! Are you hurt ? What did they do to you ? It 's okay , dad . I 'm okay . This is my friend . They said that I can keep him . Caleb , I want you to come with me . We 're going now . But we have to go with them . They won 't hurt us . Abby , are you okay ? Your mom wanted to be here , honey . - I know . The whisper people told me that mommy is safe now . They 've been protecting us all along , dad . They sent a message ahead of them .

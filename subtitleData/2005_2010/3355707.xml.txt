 The Sarah Connor chronicles ... Well , when is the time for me to live my life ? Do you know what 's extremely rare in the world of computers ? Finding one that will cross against the light . I 'd like to talk to you about an opportunity . I 'd like my company to lead the world into the next century . And I 'm fairly sure you 're an avenging angel . My father slept with a gun under his pillow . There was no pill for his sickness , no medicine to ease his mind . He left blood , and sweat , and part of his soul in a foreign land . My father never talked to me about the war he fought . He never talked to anyone . Ever vigilant , ever silent . Anyone here ? I never thought I 'd follow in his footsteps . Dr. Boyd Sherman . Child psychologist . Family therapist . Well , what 's his link to skynet , friend or foe ? Don 't know . Skynet doesn 't have friends . Well , it 's got foes , and whatever the opposite of foes are , okay ? Friends . Look , we don 't know anything here . All we know is his name 's on the list . Everyone we 've found on the list was a skynet target and needed protecting . Not everyone needs protecting . Some need ... We don 't know anything yet . Turn your head a 1 / 4 inch . Perfect . Uh , another 1 / 2 inch . Perfect . And a smile now . Warmer if you can . Warmer . Warmer . Uh , never mind . Quarter inch to the left . Perfect . Could we get the child in for a few ? You wanna be in the pictures with mommy ? No . Looks like fun . No , it doesn 't . Savannah , sit here with me . Savannah . Sit here with me . No . - Savannah ... - Ma 'am . Sit here with me . Ma 'am , maybe we shouldn 't force it . - Thank you . - Thank you . You have a child . Yes . What do you do with it ? It ? Uh , he , Leo . He had some issues during my divorce . Some days I wanted to kill him . But we went to someone . A real miracle worker . I can get you the number . Who wants to start ? I 'm not sure therapy is for us , no offense . None taken . Maybe if you tell us a little about yourself . Well , I 've been a family counselor for 20 years . I started my work up in northern California . Up north ? Silicon Valley ? Livermore . V.A. Med center . Military ? Since I 've moved down here , I 've treated civilians Almost exclusively . Iraq 's changing that , however . Do you have family in the military ? Your dad ? He passed away . Oh , I 'm sorry . Is that something you 'd all like to discuss ? It was a long time ago . We 've been on our own for some time . That must be difficult . You get used to it . Do you ? I 'm used to it . It 's fine . Is there anything else I should know ? Anything else we should know ? If we choose to go forward , I 'd like to meet with each of you individually . Is that something you 'd be open to ? I could do tomorrow if you 're up for it . Tomorrow 's good . Can you hold that , please ? Sir , you 're gonna have to take another one . That elevator 's full . Show me a tree . Happy . Funny . Hit the lights , please . It 's an unanticipated response In the symbolistic software . The A.I. keeps giving us Random , unsolicited images . We don 't know what they mean Or why it continues To respond this way . What we do know is that when we run performance tests On the A.I. , Its computational time is increasing While the optimality of its outputs is decreasing . It 's taking more time to do less . Yeah , you could say that . Yes . I just did . A lot of children come to see me . They all have something that 's bothering them . Sometimes they know what it is . Sometimes they don 't . It helps if we talk about those things . Hey . Your shoes are untied . Do you know how to tie them ? Would you like me to show you ? So ... Let 's see what we have here . Okay ? Dolls . Ooh , coloring books . Look , and we have , Oh , a set of cards With faces . Happy . Sad . Scared . Just play with anything you want . I 'm gonna talk to your mommy for a second . This will take some time . I can wait outside If it will make things go faster . More time than just today . I 'll wait outside . Where you been ? On a run . You 've been gone six hours . I guess I 'm slow . I doubled back on Sherman 's house . I got nothing . How was he ? Curious , smart , annoying . So he 's good at his job . Better than we were at ours . We bugged the office , but we still need the patient files . You 're going back ? Not my first choice . I 'm fine , okay ? I 'm fine . I was just cleaning it . I thought ... I thought I cleared it . It 's just a burn from the shell casing . You want to be the girl ? Where 's her mommy ? I don 't know . Where do you think her mommy is ? She 's working . Hmm , okay . She doesn 't like the way her mommy looks at her . No ? How does she look at her ? She wants to tell you a secret . Okay . I want my old mommy back . Your daughter is beautiful . Thank you . She looks just like her mommy . Yes . She does . I just need a minute with your mom , okay ? Wait here . What are your strongest memories from childhood ? My strongest memories ? Yeah , what do you remember most ? What 's vivid to you ? Why do you ask ? Well , the death of Savannah 's father is the most vivid memory she has . Hearing the news , the funeral . She 's so young , she has no distance from it . Well , we can 't make her grow faster , can we ? Look , I 'm ... I 'm sure you 're in a lot of pain , but you need to reassure Savannah that she hasn 't lost her mother as well as her father . Hey . You know the squirrel and the tree ? See , uh ... You make a loop for the tree . The squirrel runs around the tree . Then he dives in the hole and scurries out the other side . Savannah . John . - The usual ? - Yeah . Thanks . Jesse ? Hey , baby . What are you doing here ? Connor sent you back . What for ? Why 'd Connor send you back ? You 're here . You must know . No one told me . And you left without saying good-bye . My orders were to set up a safe house and wait . For what , I don 't know . I wait . At the park . Eating hot dogs . What about you ? What 's Connor got you doing ? Connor didn 't send me back , Derek . He didn 't ? What do you mean ? That 's new . Not to me . There 's metal everywhere these days . Looking for us . Working for us . Connor 's got at least one in every major base . A big one flipped on us , took out half a bunker . Bird . Cullie . That 's from the same shrapnel that killed Cullie . How 'd you get back here ? Cullie 's brother . He 's a bubble tech . He 's the same one ... Who sent you back . I know . Are you awol ? Jesse , did you run from the war ? I need a place to rest . You 're a soldier . You fight . Not anymore . When everything ends , I want to be here with you . Derek , please . I don 't want everything to end , just not again . When I showed you in , you , uh , you assessed the exits . You 're talking to a V.A. Doc . Every vet does it every day . Well , I don 't know what to tell you . I 'm not a vet . No , of course not . Your dad was though , right ? Vets are the ones who come back , right ? My dad never came back , so ... My mistake . I 'm sorry . Hmm . You , uh ... You didn 't have that yesterday . What happened ? Oh , it 's a burn . Just an accident . I was cooking . What were you cooking ? What ... What does that matter ? Just curious . I was boiling water for pasta . Why do you think your mother brought you here ? I don 't know . She doesn 't tell me everything . Why do you think you 're here ? I couldn 't tell you . Do you cook for the family much ? Is that a role you take on ? What ? What is your role in the family ? What do you do ? Do ? Uh , I go to school . I hang out . I 'm a kid . Are you ? You think I 'm lying ? Why don 't you check my passport or something ? I simply meant that some children who 've lost a parent feel pressure to take the place of the absent parent . They ... Well , they grow up quickly . Interesting , you say passport when a lot of kids would say driver 's license . You ever ... Feel like running , escaping ? All the time . Why ? Why do you want to escape ? Look , I want you to know everything you say is between us . This is a safe place . No , it 's not . Nowhere is . Did you know that 60 % of all teen suicides are committed with a gun ? I thought it was cleared . It was an accident . Some first attempts may appear to be an accident . What 's taking so long in there ? Can we talk ? I 'd like to see John again , alone . John ? Why ? Oh , actually , I 'd like to see all of you again . I think your daughter has some sort of social disorder . It 's too early to diagnose , but she does exhibit possible asperger 's symptoms . And John ? Yeah , this might sound strange to you , but , uh , he reminds me of veterans I used to treat . War veterans . Yeah , Vietnam , especially . The way he evaluates a room . His guardedness . The way he carries himself . Do you know of any violence in his past ? He 's never been abused , if that 's what you 're suggesting . Oh , no , no . I 'm not suggesting anything like that . Thank you , doctor . It may not be me , but that boy needs to talk to somebody . We talk . That 's not enough . Strangest thing about her ? Um , well , for one of the best minds in the tech world , she 's practically a luddite . You liar . Bicycle or car ? Bicycle . Mm-hmm . Electric or acoustic ? He thinks he 's so smart . No , no , no , I just know you , that 's all . Tell them how you work from home . Come on . Come on , tell them . My father was a butcher . One of the oldest shops in Edinburgh . We didn 't have a lot of money for school supplies . She writes on butcher 's paper . Like , big rolls of it with grease pencils . I like the way it smells . Miss Weaver , you 're needed down in the lab . It won 't run any of the tests or diagnostics . It just keeps playing these twisted pictures and doing equations . I don 't know , maybe we should consider , you know , scrapping it and starting over with a clean platform . Should I consider scrapping my team as well ? Or does that seem equally as intemperate ? Strangest thing about her ? Um , well , for one of the best minds in the tech world , She 's practically a luddite . Daddy keeps touching your tummy . Does he ? Is he trying to hug me ? I don 't know . I think he 's trying to hug me . When are we going back to Sherman ? We 're not going back , not now . Patients list was a bust . He 's got the names encoded for privacy . Tapes have been useless so far , but we 'll keep listening . Well , I can push him more , get something . Like what ? I don 't know . He 's on that wall for a reason though . For all we know , he could have a triple eight on his ass . Or it could be six months from now . There 's no timetable on the list . So you just want to give up ? We don 't know what Skynet wants from him . We can 't trust him . Maybe his name 's on the list because he helps John . Helps John ? What makes you think John needs help ? What makes you think I don 't ? Do you ? Because you can talk to me , John . You always have . No , I 'm fine . I had this friend once . We dug tunnels together . Roughest son of a bitch I ever knew . One day , he went out to take a leak . And when he was out there , he just decided to blow his head off . Just like that . He fought , and fought , and fought for his life , then just couldn 't anymore . John is not suicidal . No . But what is he ? He 's not a boy . He 's not a man . He 's not a soldier . He has changed . Saw his mother kill a man . I won 't scream . Getting off ? I 'm going down . I 'm gonna have to ask you to get off on this floor . Of course . We 're developing a human interactive A.I. It 's like a child . Its neural network needs to be trained to recognize images . Well , I guess I 'm still a little fuzzy as to why you called me here . We were in the process of training the A.I. when it stopped running all its tests . Now ... All it plays is this . Is something funny ? It is if you get the joke . It 's asking a question . Look , the question mark equals " why " . Equations , that 's " math " . Books , well , they 're books . And these images here , they all represent sadness . If you put it all together , " why is a math book so sad ? " It 's a riddle , a joke . A third grader told it to me . Around three to four years old , a child starts asking questions . But your A.I. appears to be even more advanced . It recognizes humor . That doesn 't happen until ... well , actually some people never get a sense of humor . If this were one of my patients , I would say it was a gifted child who 's grown bored . It 's amusing itself . But of course , that 's impossible . It 's just a machine . Yes , impossible . Why is a math book so sad ? Because it has so many problems . Why ? Why do you want to escape ? Look , I want you to know everything you say is between us . This is a safe place . No , it 's not . Nowhere is . Don 't you feel safe around your family ? My family ? Safe ? Well , your mother seems like a strong woman . Doesn 't that make you feel safe ? It might , if that 's what she wanted . Safe is the last thing she wants me to feel . I find that hard to believe . Oh , I 'm sure she 's right . She 's always right . Fear can be a good thing . On a bad day , it 'll keep you alive . Do you have bad days like that ? John ? I was , uh ... thinking about that time we met . You found me outside the bunker . When you went to take a leak and almost talked yourself into eating your gun ? I don 't think I 've ever thanked you for what you said that day . I think the exact words were , " Your fly 's open . " Yeah . It was . Is there a word for what we just did ? A word ? For what we just did . I can think of a few , yeah . Can you ? You wanna hear them ? No . I want a new one . Is this your way of getting rid of me ? You 'll be gone soon enough . What do we need a new word for ? I 'm pretty sure if I use one of the old ones you 'll still do it with me . I might choose to misunderstand . The old words . I have a new life , Derek . I want new words . Think of one and I might let you stay . I 'm thirsty . Can you get me a drink , please ? I don 't think I 've ever seen anything like it . It 's for my daughter . I 'm sure she 'll love it . You think so ? I don 't know what she loves . How goes the robot hunt , Mr. Ellison ? Absurd , when you put it like that . If you need any resources , you let me know . I do have a question , if that 's all right . The basement . What 's happening down there ? It seems that there 's high security . And for good reason , Mr. Ellison . We 're building something . Good luck on your hunt . Sorry about the confusion . My assistant 's out today . The temp agency 's sending someone . You all right ? You said this was a safe place , right ? That I could say anything ? That 's right . You have to understand , my mom doesn 't want me coming here . She worries . About you ? About everybody . Well , what about your sister ? Is she worried about her too ? My sister 's ... Stronger than I am . Someone broke into your house ? She forgot my birthday . I thought she did . She sent my sister out for a cake . We were alone , and a man broke in . He wanted computer equipment . He tied us up . What happened next ? Nothing . Nothing happened . The guy got what he wanted and he let us go . You know , John , sometimes children feel like they need to ... to protect their parents . But that 's not your job . You 're not one of my vets . You 're not a ... you 're not a soldier . You get to be a kid . No . Are you sure ? It was here for Dr. Sherman . - It was there to kill him . - Or to protect him . Whatever Sherman is or isn 't supposed to do , He 's gonna live to do it . For now . Well , I guess we 're not gonna get any answers from this . What 'd you do to it ? Nothing . Once I accessed the CPU , the chip destroyed itself . This model 's been redesigned . With a self-destruct feature ? Skynet must not want me reprogramming in the future . This is one way to stop you . Well , I guess they 're getting smarter . We should too . Oh , time 's up , Savannah . See you next week . Could you play for a minute , Savannah ? I 'd like to speak with the doctor . I 'm very impressed with your work . Oh , well , you 've done some good work too , Miss Weaver . Um , Savannah seems happier . I gather you 've worked hard to show her the mother she knew before her father 's death . I have , yes . But I wasn 't speaking of your work with Savannah . I meant the insight you had into my project . I could use someone with your instincts on my team . I 'm ... I 'm flattered , but I do have a responsibility to my patients . As a consultant then . You compared the A.I. to a child . Help me raise it . Well , I ... You realize you 're talking to a man who doesn 't even know how to run his own lawnmower ? Just treat it like one of your patients . You 'll do quite well . When I was a child , I did my sums on rolls of butcher paper . My father would bring them home from work . I liked the way the paper smelled . That 's my most vivid memory from childhood . What did the paper smell like ? Cow 's blood . In 1678 , Doctors diagnosed the mental affliction Soldiers suffered from as " nostalgia . " So homesickness . A longing to return to the past . The cruel reality of war Is that there is no return home . No return to innocence . What is lost is lost forever . Like my father , War 's wounds have bled me dry . No words of comfort . No words of forgiveness . No words at all . I have to say , I was surprised when you called . Why don 't you start by telling me why you 're here .

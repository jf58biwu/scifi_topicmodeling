 Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Tracking down alien life on earth and arming the human race against the future . The 21st century is when everything changes and you 've got to be ready . Diane Holmes , pilot . Please , don 't go . Come on . Aaargh ! I didn 't want saving . This programme contains some strong language . It 's my grandfather 's 88th birthday today . I thought you 'd done this for me . 88 is a joyous year for the Japanese . I 'm off to London to watch men throw rice . You get that in the Balti after stop-tap . OK , down to business . What have we got ? The Ritz Dancehall . It 's been derelict since 1989 but someone 's complained about hearing music ... music from the 1940s . Shhh ! Listen . You coming up ? Wow ! Look at the chandelier . No neon lights back then . Just dashing young soldiers and pretty young ladies . And as they danced , the girls would look into their partners ' eyes , smile softly and say ... Jack ! Mind my laptop . I was thinking more along the lines of , " How long before you head off to war ? " Come on . There 's nothing here but memories and dust . They look so real . They 're not ghosts . It 's a simple temporal shift . And it 's beautiful ! We should get out . Do call again . I would love to . It 's night ! Where 's the SUV ? Has it been stolen ? No . We have . What the hell is that ? Tosh 's rift monitor programme . She set it to alert me if there were any further movements . The rift 's been opening more and more recently . Yeah , well , I 've noticed that . Doesn 't take a genius . Tosh reckons the equations are forming a pattern . I should call her . She may have readings her end and this is over my head . Um , why wasn 't I told about this ? Well , you 've been off , haven 't you ? The line 's dead . It 's no use . It 's dead . I can 't get through to the Hub . Let 's get back inside . That 's where we were when we crossed . 'Gwen , can you get down to Sage Street ? ' Yep . What 's up ? ' We need Tosh . ' The rift monitor sounded . She 's with Jack but their phones are dead and we can 't access her files . 'OK , I 'll get down there now ' . We really are in 1941 . What if we can 't get back ? Flotsam and jetsam slips through all the time . We 'll get back . Look on the bright side . Gives you one hell of an excuse for your party . I have a life there . And they can 't help us because I have the latest readings in here . People are staring at us . We need to try to blend in . It 's easy for you to say . I 'm the only Asian here . Don 't worry . You 're with the Captain . Hey . I 've got into Tosh 's files , all her reports . See there , December 24th . That 's when Diane flew through the rift . I had to let her go . You were in love with her , weren 't you ? If Tosh knows a way of opening the rift , maybe we can get Diane back . Jack would never allow it . Opening the rift could devastate the city . # My love is true # And just for you # I would do most anything at any time ... # Water , please , and a brandy . I haven 't seen you in here before . Three and six , please , sir . I 'll , er ... get them . Thank you . On one condition . What ? # Come to me , my melancholy baby ... # Why 's George dancing with a Jap ? The SUV 's here . They must be here somewhere . Jack ? Tosh ! Jack ! # Come to me , my melancholy ... # Do you mind ? I 'm only borrowing her , mate . Maybe she doesn 't want to be borrowed . You want to make something of it ? You can always dance with me . OK , I 'll lead . You follow . Come on , Tosh . Jack ! Jack , we 're meant to be blending in . Cut it out , kiddo . Sorry about that . The men are a bit lively tonight . It 's last day of OTU tomorrow . Apologise to the gentleman , George . I was only dancing . I think it was your fist he didn 't like , not your foxtrot . I 'm sorry . It 's OK . You barely got me . I think the lady also deserves an apology . I 'm sorry . Apology accepted . Let 's get a drink , George . Hey , are you a volunteer too ? Yeah . I 'm Captain ... You go first . I 'm Captain Jack Harkness . 133rd Squadron . Look this way , please . Right , the Ritz Dancehall , opened in 1932 , shut down in 1989 . Due to be demolished in one week . Now , the reported music is from the 1940s . Why is a ghost job taking them this long ? All those young soldiers ... Owen , look . There . One more for the record , sir . I insist . Thank you , gentlemen . I should be heading off .. Hey , I didn 't catch your names . Toshiko Sato . I 'm Captain James Harper . 71st . 71st , that 's where I 'm hoping to be posted . What 's your poison ? Maybe later . My friend and I were in the middle of something . Sure . Why does that man have your name ? I 'm lost enough here without you holding back on me ! It 's not my name . It 's his . I took his . But I didn 't realise he was ... so hot ! Jack ! I know too much . Then ... share . You wouldn 't want that . Trust me . We have to get back . What 's in here ? I 've got half the equation in here . The other half 's back at the Hub . If I can find some way of getting these figures back to base , they can combine them , open the rift and bring us back through . Come on . I heard music earlier . If I can hear them , maybe they can hear me . They 've got to come back . Jack ! Tosh ! What ? I thought I heard my name . OK , so we use Tosh 's information to open the rift and bring them back . We can 't . Half the equation 's missing . It can 't be . It must be somewhere else . Let me try . It 's not there . It might be in her laptop . Which she never goes anywhere without . Shit . Shit ! No-one here . Come on , quick . It works ! 'Your battery is running low ' . Just take down everything , in case it dies . I 'm not used to writing with these things ! Don 't press so hard . Oh , no . LAPTOP : ' Your battery is low . ' Can you read that ? Plus one over five a ... sine two eight X. 'Your battery ... ' You got everything you need ? I just need the coordinates of the hall , so I can integrate them into the equation . Then we need to get the information back to the Hub . What are you doing in here ? Who are you ? Captain ... James Harper . And this is Toshiko Sato , friend and mathematician . I 'm Bilis , the manager . You 're not in full uniform , Captain . On leave . 48 hours . That 's an interesting camera . It takes photographs instantly . I didn 't know they could do that yet . And I didn 't know they made an attache case out of metal . Where did you get it ? London . I 'm from there . I should go back , dear . They 're coming for us now . I 've had a good look around but the doors were locked . Can I help you ? I 'm the caretaker . Bilis Manger , at your service . Hello . Could you open it all up for me ? I think some of my friends got locked in . Follow me . Thank you . Pearl Harbour , Jack . Doesn 't happen till the end of the year . Granddad stayed in London but he was persecuted . If I stay here , what will happen ? I 'll take care of you . This period , you look like you fit in . Have you been here before ? Yeah . I can 't explain but I served in the war in 1941 . I was undercover . I needed a false identity , so I took ... his name . Who were you before you took his name ? Why him ? It was convenient . But if you chose his identity to steal , then he ... ? Dies , in battle . When ? Tomorrow . And I say , " Look , love , it 's raining bombs and fire , so get down that cellar . " And she says , " I can 't , there 's rats down there ! " So , who 's the best navigator here ? Tim . He can 't fly for toffee , but at least when he goes down , he 'll know exactly where he is . Why don 't we chat over here ? I give the public schoolboy a fortnight . That boy 's come a long way in five weeks . As long as you boys remember your training , you 'll be all right . Glad you came . Shall we sit down ? Why were your friends in here , anyway ? Just a silly dare . Someone said it was haunted . You look worried , dear . I 'll make you a nice cup of tea . The sun rose this morning at 08.12 , 21 by 7 degrees . I note it down every day . It 's a bit silly , I suppose . It 's fantastic . You must have seen some action . Let 's just say the enemy comes in many guises . Yeah , I can 't wait to give Jerry what for . How many did you kill in the Battle of Britain , sir ? 26 , wasn 't it ? You 've read that story countless times . No-one 's as fast as him . Hasn 't lost a man yet . Care for a drink , Captain ? I 'll just have water , thanks . All right . Hello , Jack . I know you 're having a night with the men but I thought I 'd look in , if that 's all right . Yeah . Good to see you . Is anyone expecting you ? Yes . Perhaps you should call them , otherwise they may think you 've disappeared too . I 'll put the kettle on . Anything your end ? There are no more photographs of Jack and Tosh after that night . That 's encouraging . Yeah , unless the bombs got ' em . The manager , Bilis Manger , kept them for posterity . Bilis Manger ? That 's the name of the caretaker . Can 't be the same guy , can it ? Not old enough . But he does look a bit out of his time . He wears a cravat . Gwen , he 's in the photo with Jack and Tosh . He 's the answer . He came through the rift . Find out what he 's doing . No . Get out , Gwen . Wait for backup . We can 't lose him . Nor Gwen ! Maybe this is a trap . He could be sucking us back through time one by one . Get out of there , Gwen . I 'm sorry but who put you in charge ? I 've got what I need . Now all I have to do is find a way to leave a message for the team on something that will last across time . OK . I haven 't seen you two here before . Is she with you ? Nah , she 's after Tim . Why else would she let him bore her to death about navigation ? Maybe she 's a spy . The Chinese are on our side , aren 't they ? I 'm Japanese . You 're hardly an ally , then . Leave it , Audrey . So whose side are you on ? What 's in the bag ? Nothing . If you 've got nothing to hide , open the bag ! She can 't . Her work is top secret . She 's a decoder for the Brits . Without her , we 'd have no way of defending the country . To Toshiko . Toshiko ! I need Bilis 's camera . Photographs last , don 't they ? Sure you don 't want me to come with you ? Oh , you can 't run out on me . I 've just got you a drink . I 'm fine . You carry on . To a fellow captain . So , what brings you down here ? I had to rest up . Injured my back bailing over Kent . That 's his excuse for not dancing . Mind if I join you ? Sure . Why not ? Starting to be a habit . I just wanted to try it out . This little beauty is very unusual and rare , not unlike yourself . Don 't go without this . I could think of better things to photograph than numbers , my dear . Do call again . What are you doing ? Owen ! We haven 't got the missing numbers . We 'll improvise with the Rift Manipulator . We can 't . It 's risky enough with the equation . If we don 't do it properly , anything can happen . Bombs are falling . They 're stuck in the middle of the Cardiff Blitz . It 's our duty to get ' em out . Jack ? Open the rift and the world could suffer . We could all get sucked in . Who knows what will come out ? This is about Diane ! When will you accept she chose to leave you ? Whereas your cyber-girlfriend stuck around . Not that she had a choice , wired in the cellar . That was different . Yeah . Mainly because Diane didn 't try and kill us and she also happened to be a human being . Stop it . Not some monster . I thought she was still Lisa . I loved her . You only knew Diane for a week . And it wasn 't enough . Maybe the Manipulator can calculate the missing figures . It isn 't working . Good . Jack would never have wanted us to use it this way . There 's a piece missing . We 've got to find it . Maybe you should go home . You don 't have any power over me . OK , Ianto , we 'll play it your way - safe and boring . So , what 's your next mission ? Careless talk costs lives . I should go anyway . No , I didn 't mean that to ... It 's all right . I can get a lift if I leave now . I 'd better stay here . Aren 't you leaving tomorrow night ? You sick of us Welsh already ? Yeah , that 's why I 'm still fighting for you . I 'll be in touch when I 'm next on leave . Nancy ... it 's been a good few weeks . Was that it ? She 's a sweet kid , but I need to look after my men tonight . It 's their last day tomorrow . Go after her . Kiss her goodbye . Anything can happen tomorrow . It 's just a routine training exercise . I 'm hardly gonna die . That 's when they catch you , when you least expect it . You don 't know what 's ahead . Kiss her ... goodbye . Nancy ? I love you . That just made things 20 times worse . Now she thinks she 's in love with me . Hey , her falling for you is hardly my fault . Play it coo in front of your men , but not me . It 's OK to be scared . A captain has to keep his head . A captain needs to explain risks , tell his men what to expect . So what do I do ? Tell ' em I saw a young boy get shot in the eyes mid-flight ? I understand . Do you ? Did you hear him on the radio , yelling for his mom , while the Messerschmitts shot him blew his plane apart ? All I can hear on the radio ... Is screams . I went to war when I was a boy . I was with my best friend . We got caught crossing the border over enemy lines . They tortured him because he was weaker . They made me watch him die . And they let me go . Who were they ? The worst possible creatures you can imagine . I persuaded him to join up . I said it would be an adventure . He hadn 't lived . Have any of us ? OK , team ... I hope you like treasure hunts . No sign of Bilis leaving the area . Er , where are you off to ? The dancehall . Bilis 's office . He must know how the rift works . Maybe we 'll find a clue there . What would Jack and Tosh do ? How would they try and help us ? Bilis ! I need more equations , Gwen . What happened here , Tosh ? No . Toshiko ! Toshiko ! Jack ! This way ! I didn 't get the first part in the photo . The rest is outside . If they find it , they 'll keep looking , won 't they ? Yeah . 'Be careful , Gwen . Bilis is still around ' . Owen , where are you ? ' I 'm in the building . Where 's Bilis 's office ? ' It 's at the far end of the corridor . I 'll keep looking out here . Yes ! Thing is , you could be the last girl I ever kiss . I 've got to finish the message . Pencil will fade . I need to find something else . Airtight . This 'll do . # There 'll be bluebirds over # The white cliffs of Dover # Tomorrow # Just you wait and see ... # Shit ! Timepieces . I didn 't find any equations . Um , I 'll get back to the Hub . I 'll keep looking here , then . Yeah , you do that . Yes . Of course I 'm scared . I 'm going to check everywhere for the other figures . I 'm not going to leave Jack now . # There 'll be bluebirds over ... # Let the dancing continue ! I 've finished . The rest of the equation is hidden . What happened ? I slipped . I 've got a first-aid kit in the van . Scotch , Captain ? I 'd like some time in private with Captain Harper . Ianto ? Yeah , it 's me . I 've found it . It 's written in blood . Gwen 's found the rest of Tosh 's readings . What 's she got for us ? Cos sine squared , axcx = x over 2 . No , I need at least three more numbers , Gwen . They must be somewhere else . 'No , they 're not ' . Well , how do you know ? Somebody scraped out the final numbers . Tosh has written a message at the end . It says , " Tell my family I love them . " Why did you make me kiss her goodbye ? I just think you should live every night like it 's your last . Make tonight the best night of your life . You 're alive - right here , right now . Your men are fine . What are you trying to say ? Go to her . Go to your woman and lose yourself in her . Maybe I should . Yeah . Is Toshiko your woman ? No . There 's no-one . Go to her . It still won 't work . There 's a piece missing . Bilis had it all along . We still don 't have all the equation . Maybe the machine can work it out . Owen ! There must be something in the safe . We need better instructions . You can 't open it . You 've no right . I 'm second in command . I have got every fucking right . There 's stuff we don 't know about . That 's how Jack likes it . I won 't play with his toys , Ianto ! " Rhea Silva , the god of war 's missus . " And a nine-digit number . Not so clever , Jack . Blueprints for the Rift machine . I thought you 'd gone . This could be your last chance . That 's why I came back . I might have to leave before the night is over . Well , then make the most of now . We need lovers ' corner , if you don 't mind , boys . Of course . I was just discussing strategies with the captain . We 'll go somewhere else . No . You 've told me all I need to know . There 's instructions in here . This isn 't a random act of madness . It 's a trap ! Bilis wanted you to find it . Why ? To provoke the rift . To incite total chaos and destruction . All the reports of the haunted dancehall were anonymous . What if it was him ? Please , listen to me ! I 'm tired of being in awe of the rift . I 'm tired of living with Jack 's secrets . We don 't even know who he is . He 's our leader . Not any more . Get out of my way . Ianto ! Ugh ! Tomorrow is their last training exercise , just another day . They go out on a sortie and are surprised by two formations of Messerschmitts . He destroys three of the enemy . His men listen to his whoops of joy over the radio . Then it all goes quiet . He can 't bail out because his whole plane is on fire . But his men all make it back to safety . Put the key down . Or I 'll shoot . Who were you ? A conman . That 's why I took his name , falsified his records so it seemed he was still alive . How did you end up in Torchwood ? Someone saved my life . Brought me back from death . And ever since then , it 's been like they 're keeping me for something and I don 't know what it is . I 'm sorry for dragging you into this . It was my choice . I 'll look after you . But there 's nothing I can do for him . You have to let Diane go . Like I did with Lisa . Don 't compare yourself to me . You 're just a tea boy . I 'm much more than that . Jack needs me . In your dreams , Ianto . In your sad wet dreams when you 're his part-time shag , maybe . That rift took my lover and my captain . So if I die trying to beat it , then it will all be in the line of duty . Aaargh ! You don 't know what you 've done . # That certain night # The night we met # There was magic abroad in the air # There were angels dancing at the Ritz # And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square ... # # .. I may be right # I may be wrong ... # What 's he doing ? # .. But I 'm perfectly willing to swear ... # Jack ! Jack , we need to get out ! Jack , you have to ! We need you ! I have to go . It 's my duty . Oh , you made it ! You made it ! You made it . Oh , Tosh , come here , come here , come here ! I 'm fine ! I knew we did the right thing , opening the rift . Still no sign of Bilis . World didn 't end after all , did it ? Good job you 're a crap shot . I was aiming for your shoulder . It was wartime , I know , but it was beautiful . There were angels dancing at the Ritz . - Jack ... - Let me . He would have been so proud that you took his name . Because here you are , saving the world . To Captain Jack . To Captain Jack .

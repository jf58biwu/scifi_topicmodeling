 No , I 'm not really sure I understand what you 're saying . - You 're not listening . - Yes , I am . Back door , Bob . Come on . Are you saying the soul comes into being at the moment of conception ? - That is God 's truth . - We got it , guys . So is the soul part of our DNA or is it an artifact of sperm meeting egg during sexual union ? Wes , you 've got to get her out of here before the ... Oh , shit . Stem cells have souls ... Souls belong to God ! - Come on ! - Murderers ! 2.05 - Massive Changes You didn 't answer my question : Do you believe in God ? Bob . How many times have you asked me that ? But you never answer . Do you believe that a deity can hear our prayers ? Or is it a divine force that created our universe ? Did that chick spray you with something ? Well where do we come from ? A random accident ? I came from Lydia and Toumas Sandstrom , so yeah , it was a random accident . Probably the last time they ever had sex together . Hey , when did we become protest central for stem cell nuts ? Since the Diabetes Foundation jumped the gun and announced that Jill derived pancreatic beta cells from stem cells . She was supposed to keep that quiet . All I know is Caroline 's pounding her for using a stem cell line Washington hasn 't approved . Last time I looked this was Canada . Jill 's a U.S. citizen . We 're partly funded by U.S. dollars . - She 's bound by their protocols . - That 's bullshit . Caroline ! Well where do we come from ? A random accident ? I came from Lydia and Toumas Sandstrom . So , yeah , it was a random accident . Probably the last time they ever had sex together . Hey , since when did we become protest central ... Hi Bob , I heard New York was good . Hi . Really good . Not so much . I bought a present for Glenn . A Christmas book ? It 's a scratch and sniff . Smell it . It smells like pine . Yeah , it 's full of gingerbread , orange and chocolate ... I thought it would be nice . I could scratch it for him and then he could smell it . You know ... to stimulate his senses . That 's awfully nice of you , Bob . Thank you . Well , you said Christmases were always special for you and Glenn ... - They were , Bob . Thank you . - Caroline ! - Am I interrupting something ? - No ... I was just ... - I 've got to check my e-mail . - Well don 't just run off , Bob , - I 've got work for you to do . - I 'll be at my desk . Since when do the bozos in Washington dictate the terms of our stem cell research ? They 're dictating the terms of employment of American-paid researchers , like Jill . And she can only use one of the fifteen stem cell lines approved by Washington . That was the agreement she signed . Okay , we 're talking about a potential treatment for juvenile diabetes , okay ! - Tens of thousands of lives ! - Let 's just figure a way out of it . Washington covers 70 % of our operating budget . Maybe it 's time to find somebody else to cover our operating budget . - Can you sign here ? - Okay , thanks Wes . Your conference call is set to start in 10 minutes . I have to spin this for a bunch of Bible thumping Senators . - It 's what you do best . - Yeah , well , you 're the head Scientist , so ... - give me some ammunition . - Okay . Bible thumpers , huh ? Okay , here it is ... Our American researcher , Jill Langston , is on the verge of a major breakthrough towards finding a cure to juvenile diabetes . She 's managed to differentiate pancreatic cells using the approved stem cell line . - It 's totally kosher . - Okay , what about the South Korean stem cell line ? Jill never touched it . Her lab assistant , who is not an American citizen , used the unapproved stem cell line to generate supernatant nutrients that kept Jill 's pancreatic cells alive . And she had nothing to do with generating those nutrients ? Nothing . Mostly . - Morning . - Hey . Just in case anyone asks you only worked with U.S. approved stem cell lines . - That 's not entirely true . - It is now . Who are you ? Jona . We haven 't met . I 'm David . I 'm in charge . You generated the supernatants using the South Korean line . I know , we 're a team here . We all work together . - But this one is all yours , Okay ? - David , what about lab books ? Oh yeah . Yeah , make sure your lab books back that up . - You want us to rewrite our lab books ? - No . No . No , I just want you to fix any mistakes . Fuck . Fuck ! Fuck ! David , we are waiting for you in the Conference Room . Okay , from the New York subway . Sunshine Davis age 15 . Billy Connett age 41 . St. Mike 's hematology ran every test that you asked for David . There was nothing in their blood to suggest any known disease . No disorder . Absolutely no infection . - Virology ? - No viruses . No bacteria . - Sorry . Sorry I 'm late . - What have you got ? I ran the symptoms against every neurological database . Best I could come up with was a Syndrome called Lesch-Nyhan Disease . Okay , but I don 't think it could be Lesch-Nyhan . - I agree . - Why not ? Well , according to the database , there are similarities of symptoms : spasticity , self-destructive behaviour , biting of the hands and lips- - But Lesch-Nyhan is a childhood disorder . You 're born with renal failure . Rarely survive into adolescence . - You guys done ? - One more thing . Girls are asymptomatic carriers . - Only boys get it . - And the disease is purely genetic . Maybe not . Sometimes unbearable suffering can only be alleviated by inflicting greater pain through self-injury . Okay , let 's see what we can find in the environmental samples , cross reference to the blood . We 've got water , air , wall scrapings , and one dead rat . Male . - Me . - Attaboy , Bob . Carlos , you and I will do standard toxicity tests on the rest . - Gas chromatograph and mass spec . - ASAP . The North American Biotechnology Commission is once again in a storm of controversy this time over stem cell research . Last year NorBAC was the site of a shooting ... - Hey . - Hey . You should take a break . I 'm fine . Well you look exhausted . Can I give you a ride home ? No thanks . - Are you gonna stop soon ? - What ? Stop working soon . I can 't . I messed up . And I told the diabetes people too much too soon . - Yeah . - I haven 't finished my due diligence and now I have protesters wanting to shut me down , so ... Don 't worry about any of that . You 'll work it out . Not by taking a break , or going to sleep . Or talking to me . Okay . I 'll see you tomorrow . I 'll see you tomorrow . In the water we found nitrogen and potassium . What about you , Carlos ? In the human blood ... yes . What about the molds you found ? Wouldn 't cause anything but a bad set of allergies . We also found trace amounts of fecal coliform in the water . - And in the air . - Makes sense down there . Did you do a full run on the air sample ? Yeah . I found high levels of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide . And also Cymoxanil , Fungicide and Pymetrozine . - What ? - Herbicides . All right . What about your rat ? Died of old age . He was about three . But , we found formaldehyde in his liver . Okay . So what is it ? Is it Nitrogen ? Potassium ? Molds ? Phosphate ? Fecal coliform ? Herbicide ? Fungicides ? Formaldehyde ? None of the above ? All of the above ? Lesch-Nyhan disease . What is killing these people ? What is going on down in that subway ? History of Hwang Shin Yong 's stem cell lab at the National University in Seoul . Background on the line you 've been using . South Korean certification , - all the publications . - Can you get it to me on a disc ? Amazing . It 'd be great if I could get a list of all of the research teams worldwide that are using the Korean stem cell line . I can do that for you . Really ? I mean that 's not exactly your job . My job is to do whatever Caroline tells me and right now she 's telling me that this stem cell mess could bury us . Okay . Thanks for your support . All right , where do you find nitrogen ? - Foods , fertilizers , explosives . - Potassium ? - Food . Plant growth . Mining ? - Molds . Well , there 's phosphates in detergents . And in fertilizers . Nitrogen , potassium and phosphates . The three components of fertilizers ! You might have something there . Farmers use formaldehyde to sterilize the soil . It kills weeds , insect eggs - molds , fungi . That doesn 't make sense . Why would there be a farm in the subway ? Why would someone want to grow something in a subway ? Because you wouldn 't want anyone to know what you were growing . Marijuana . Psilocybin Mushrooms . Opium ... They got a grow up down there . Okay , so let 's go with that for now . We still don 't know what 's making people sick . - What 's the only thing we haven 't checked ? - What 's that ? What they 're growing . Owen , I can 't believe it . You actually answered your phone . David Sandstrom calling . You went dark on me there for a while . How you doing ? I 'm okay . Two more people are sick , though . Biting their fingers , and ... - shaking a lot . - What are you growing down there ? How close would I be if I guessed marijuana ? The silence of " You guessed right . " Listen Owen . We think it 's the weed that 's making people sick . Sunshine never smoked chronic . Really ? Sunshine never smoked it . Hang on , Owen . We 're thinking . Esters . - What ? - All plants give off esters . You know the aroma in flowers , I use them in my perfumes . You think esters can trigger something specific - in certain people . - It 's possible . It 's all we 've got . Owen , we think it 's in the air . Now listen . I got a friend , he 's got a lab at Columbia , - I want you to bring him some leaves . - That 's pretty far , man . You want to pay for my cab ? You live in the subway , Owen , it 's free . Here 's a list of the labs using your South Korean stem cell line for disease related gene therapy . There 's lots of work on cancer . There 's only a few publications so far . Most of the research is still in the pipeline . Okay , Wes , Tell me the truth . How much time do I have to finish my work ? The clock 's ticking . David darling , I know you 're very busy , but can you please call me when you have a minute . It 's about your father . Beautiful day in Vancouver . Love you . What ? Hey David , it 's Yasmin Sharif from the Singapore Symposium , remember ? - Hey Yaz ! - You remember ? - Yeah , I remember . How are you ? - I gave a talk in Paris . Now I 'm over-nighting on my way to the Salk . Are you free for dinner ? You know , I was just thinking : what am I gonna eat for dinner ? Glenn , I brought you a present . Christmas Wishes . It 's a scratch and sniff book . Christmas tree . Hum . Yeah . Glenn , I have this theory : I needed if you exercise your muscles with your mind , it maybe work in the opposite direction and your muscles will make your mind stronger . So , we 're going to go for a jog in Central Park . Ready ? Okay . It 's a beautiful winter morning , Glenn . We 're jogging down a path through a snowy cedar forest . You look up through the boughs , it 's like a fragrant white veil . Hey , look at that , a beautiful woman , I think she smiled at you , Glenn . We 're heading up hill now , and just when we 're about to get to the top we can almost see the Waldorf Plaza . It 's snowing really lightly , and the wind 's really hitting your face . Oh , no , no , no . Shit ! Damn it ! You okay ? Reverse transcriptase DNA sequences ? What does that mean ? It looks like these stem cells are contaminated with a retrovirus . How 'd that happen ? I don 't know . The line has been checked and re-checked for viruses and retro-viruses by labs all over the world . You 're exhausted , Jill . Go home . Jona . Uh ... I want you to remake and sterilize all the buffers and then I 'm going to thaw a fresh batch of cells . - Jill go home . - Wes please . Go away . You 're amazing . And here all this time I thought you were a mere brilliant scientist . You finished it . - Yeah , totally . It reads like the wind . - Get out . I 'm serious , Yaz . It 's really really good . A memoir . Where did this come from ? I 've always wanted to write . My parents were getting old . Just seemed like the right time to record their stories before they got lost . I could never do this . Why ? Well it 'd be five pages long , to start with . My mother was an orphan , so they 're silence on that side of the family . My dad is Swedish . That 's major silence . I was an only child . Everybody else 's family always seemed like a big ... brass band . - Hmm . - What ? I dunno ... - I rush things . - No , No . It 's not you . Let 's take it nice and slow . Okay . Excuse me . Hey . I think the South Korean stem cell line is producing a retrovirus . What ? No ... that line has been in circulation for 18 months . There 's teams all over the world using it . They would have seen that by now . - Just redo it . - He did . - Do it again . - He did , and I did , and I will . - But I 'm crashing . - Okay , okay . That 's all right , do it again tomorrow . And right now go home and crash . - I can 't . - You want a sleeping pill ? No . I can 't go home . Why ? My apartment 's been flooded . My landlords live upstairs and their toilet flooded into my bedroom . All my clothes are all trashed . And they 're claiming that their insurance isn 't cooperating , they want me to stay in a motel ! Stay here . - Really ? - Yeah , of course . Why not ? - I just ... I 'm not ... - Hey . Hey . You need a place to stay , I got plenty of room . Come in , you can sleep in Lilith 's room . Thank you . Oh . Hey . Hey . - Oh , oh , Christ , I 'm sorry . - What ? - I have an early flight , David . - No . Okay , now wait a minute . You know what I should actually probably just get back to the lab . - Thanks for the read , I really appreciate it . - Okay , now You 're both talking at the same ... - ... see you tomorrow . It was nice to meet you . - Bye . Bye . Uh ... Bye . - Who was that ? - That was a friend . Just a friend . Come in . Lilith 's bed is in Lilith 's room . Which is right over there . Go . Thank you . - Jill , you still here ? - Yeah , I 'm just leaving . Yeah ! Guess we should talk about New York , eh ? I mean ... Did it seem different to you ? I mean , this time ... You know , like , between you and me ? Jill ? Your friend at Columbia had his lab up all night sequencing the marijuana DNA . - I got some thoughts . - Okay , Just give me a second . You sort out the retrovirus scare ? It 's not a scare . We redid the test with a new batch . Got the same result . My South Korean supernatant is laced with reverse transcriptase . You checked your equipment for contaminates ? Yes , three times . I want you to send some frozen stem cells over to Jim Prall 's lab . - See what he comes up with . - You think I missed something ? No , I think this is too important not to get a second opinion . Yes ? Yeah . Okay . So this is the gene sequence of some of the marijuana sample . Now , we found biosynthetic genes inserted into the genome . - See , right there . - It 's been engineered ? Yeah . In fact , it looks like this strain 's been developed to enhance the THC content of medicinal marijuana . Where did you get these ? Courtesy of the Vancouver Hydroponic Growers Association . The Hydroponic Growers Association ? Marijuana is Canada 's fourth biggest cash crop . - Really ? - Believe it . - Wheat , canola , corn- - - Marijuana . Okay . Where 's the stuff from the subway come from ? Originally ? A bio-genetics lab in Melbourne . Look at this . The extra THC producing genes they 've popped up in at least 15 places in the genome . - An incredibly modified strain . - You get Franken-dope . So Lesch-Nyhan is characterized by abnormal functioning of neurotransmitters , but this can 't be Lesch-Nyhan because that 's ... a genetic disorder . But ... we need to find out if the compounds in this modified plant can cause Lesch-Nyhan-like symptoms ? Because maybe you can be genetically predisposed for total reefer madness . David . We 're pretty sure it 's the weed . Dude , I can 't get rid of it , it 's not mine . Well look , just move your people out of the subway then until we do more tests , okay ? Dude , subway is where we live . Then move them to a different line , Owen . I hear the IRT is lovely this time of year . It 's the people or the pot , Owen . This close to a breakthrough for diabetes research . There are thousands of retroviruses in human DNA , fragments of stuff that goes back to when we crawled out of the primordial muck . 99 % of it is dormant and harmless . Then why is this retrovirus such a big deal ? Because we found reverse transcriptase activity . The retrovirus isn 't dormant anymore . It woke up . It 's replicating itself . The virus is active . Okay , what kind of virus are we talking about ? Don 't know . Could give you the sniffles , could be the next AIDS . Research teams all over the world have been using this stem cell line . I mean , if it 's corrupted then cures for all kinds of diseases could be pushed years down the track . Then pull the stem cell line . No . You can 't tell a researcher in Europe to throw away 10 years of her work on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . She 's going to want to know why and as a scientist I 'm going to want to give her that answer . Not some song and dance to cover my ass . We need to figure out what 's going on here before we let this out . Okay . I got it . - Jill , as soon as you find anything out , let me know . - Of course . My mom . She never calls me on my cell . Hey . Oh , hi Dad . Hang on a second . We done here ? Yeah . Ah . What 's up ? Things are not so good , David . I 've been looking for your phone number all day . Mum 's got it written on the fridge , Dad . - She 's not here anymore , David . - What do you mean ? Your mother she died yesterday . - David , you got a sec ? - Yeah . Okay , so we 're thinking that chemical signals from the hybrid marijuana plants produces an ester that disables the HPRT enzyme . The trigger could easily be chemical . It 's not genetic . But the result is the same ... Without the HPRT enzyme doing its job , poisons build up in the system and you develop the disease . You get Lesch-Nyhan syndrome . Wow ... Well , that 's it then . I 'll call Owen and let him know . David , are you OK ? Yeah . I 'm going to have to go to Vancouver for a few days . But uh ... What is it , David ? Ah , it 's ... Family matter . Who died ? My mom . Lydia . I 'm sorry , David . Are you okay ? Look , don 't tell anybody , okay ? Just , uh ... You can tell Mayko . I mean , she 'd want to know . She met Lydia . Don 't tell Caroline . Fuck , you know what , you should probably tell Caroline . Otherwise she 'll think I fucked off to China again . You can tell Jill , I guess . I 've got to go . I 've got to go . - Have a safe trip . - Thanks . - Call if you need anything . - Yeah . - Did you hear about this thing in Florida ? - No . There 's some kind of superbacterium attacking citrus crops . - Put Bob on it . - Bob 's not going to go to Florida by himself . Then you go , Wes . Hey Lil . It 's me . How are you ? Where are you , I should say . I 'm sorry to leave a message like this on your cell phone but I 've got to catch a plane in a few hours , so I ... Well , I just ... I thought you should know that your grandma passed away . yesterday . Sorry pal . Don 't be sad , David , darling . Everything that lives must die . Pants isn 't even two , mum . It was her time to go . No ! Shush . I 've read the books , mum ! Guinea pigs live four to six years . Pants died because dad put her cage on the porch . Your father has allergies sweatie . I want a dog but I can 't have a dog so I get a guinea pig and he puts her out and the temperature goes down ... David , David , David ... She died of pneumonia , mum . She had all the symptoms from the book ; rapid breathing , runny eyes , lethargy- - David . She got cold , it weakened her , then she got a bacterial infection . It 's not fair . I know . Where will I bury her ? Well , we could bury her in the rose garden . I loved her . Everything dies , David . It 's nature 's way . It 's Dad 's way . It 's okay to be sad . Have a good cry . I don 't want to cry . Gimme the bad news , Caroline . I did some digging after we spoke . Our American researcher was using an unapproved stem cell line to generate nutrients for her pancreatic clones . How did that happen ? The American researcher did her background checks on the South Korean stem cells and she found an active retrovirus . Thing is , labs all over the world are using this stem cell line . We will eventually have to report our findings . You 're going to tell the world that a U.S. Scientist was working on an unapproved stem cell line ? Unless we go on the offensive , not the defense . What ? ! NorBAC finds contaminants in an unapproved stem cell line . South Korean suppliers look bad and , by inference , so do all the countries who sell outside Washington 's approval system ! What 's not to like ? - You are good . - I know . Well ... Thank you . Identify those contaminants . Put them out there . I 'll handle the rest . I 'm on it . I will . Thank you . Hey , Dad . Hey , Dad . David , It 's good you could come . I couldn 't find your phone number . Yeah . How are you doing ? Want a beer ? So what happened , Dad ? I don 't know . I was in there painting . She said she was going come in here and make my sandwich . An hour goes by . I knew something was wrong . It doesn 't take an hour to make a sandwich . So I come in here and ... there she is lying on the floor right there . - What did Dr. Mitchell say ? - He said she was dead . She was younger than me , don 't forget . I 'm the one with the health problems , not her . She worried too much . That 's what killed her . She worried about you all her life . That 's why . - What did you say ? - Nothing . Look , are the funeral arrangements in hand ? - I left that all to them . - Who ? The funeral parlor . No , Dad , they can 't do it all . We 've have to choose the music , we have to figure out the order of the service , who 's going to say what . - That sort of stuff . - I 'm too tired . Alright . What 's the name of the funeral parlor ? I 'll do it . The minister 's name is written down by the telephone in the bedroom . Alright . Your mother didn 't live as a Lutheran but it looks like she 's going to die as one . McGuinn 's coming up to brief us . All I know is , Washington is on the verge of mounting some kind of strike on Cuban biological labs . Just because of some infested orange groves in Florida ? I don 't know . I don 't know . We 'll know better in a couple of days . But I have a feeling this is going to be a priority case . Hey , Carlos . Could I have a private word with Caroline ? Yeah , sure . Hey , Bob . What 's up ? I think exercise might be the answer for Glenn . What do you mean ? I 've been taking him on runs . Runs ? Well , imaginary runs . Se , I think the mental exercise may stimulate the neural pathways to his muscles . And because he 's following along in his head , if I tell him we 're about to jump a fence he 'll tell his muscles to jump the fence and bit by bit by bit he 'll get back in shape . When I talk to Glenn ... I can feel him listening . His brain is intact , Caroline . Some of the pieces are disconnected . I think we can try ... to reconnect them . Let me try . OK . Thank you , Caroline . Thank you ! My mother didn 't really have a life of her own . She sort of lived for and through other people . You know ? My father , me , my daughter . She was incredibly bright . She read widely . She wrote beautifully . She had enormous empathy for people of all shapes and sizes . She could sing like a bird . I wish I knew her , she sounds like a wonderful woman . Well , she spent her life making sandwiches for a man who resented her . I gave this to her for Christmas last year . It 's full of the music that she loved . I noted a couple of selections for the service . Oh , and this goes with her in the ... in the coffin , casket , you know ... W.H. Auden , it 's her favourite poet . - And the service ? - Oh , nothing fancy . Do you want to say a few words ? I 'm making grilled cheese , you want one ? - What ? - Do you want a sandwich ? Why would I want a sandwich ? Right . Stupid question . What is this ? Grilled cheese . You know , Dad , you 're going to want to get a housekeeper . - What for ? - Because you can 't live like this . Well , don 't look at me . This is all your mother 's business . You blame mom for the mess ? I go on and on . Do this , do that . She pays no attention , so finally I shut up about it . So be it . Have it your way . And we live like this . Don 't think this is the way I like it . You know , maybe it 's time you let her off the hook , hey . Why should I ? Because she 's dead , Dad . I thought you didn 't want a sandwich . You made it for me , why not ? I don 't like people watching me while I eat . That 's what the television is for . Go watch television . I want to play a little game with you , Dad . I hate games . I 'm going to say five words . And after I count to five I want you to say them back to me , okay ? Poodle , knife , ball , steamboat , refrigerator . One , two , three , four , five . Go . Caniche , couteau , bateau à vapeur , balle , réfrigérateur . Fuck you . Why are you always so angry ? Pudel , kniv , bat , bal , kyl skap . How 's your Swedish ? You never taught me a word . Only thing I remember about my childhood is everybody creeping around because you were always in a bad mood . - I never get angry . - No ? Well I do . I got your temper . It 's the only thing you ever gave me . And I hate it . You should see someone . I 've got to lie down . There 's no time . Go get dressed . - What ? - There 's a car coming for us at eleven . What car ? We are burying Mom today , Dad . Well , I don 't want to go . Well , you don 't have a choice in the matter . Go get dressed . You understand nothing . What 's this ? Calla lilies . Thank you . She liked calla lilies . Here 's a story about my mom . One time , I was about seven years old , I ... I came home from school , all the lights in the house were out , which was strange because I was just learning how to walk home from school by myself and the deal was that my mom was supposed to always be waiting for me in the kitchen . But the house was dark and ... so I started to panic . And I started calling out her name . Not mom , like her name . Like , " Lydia ! Lydia ! " And I started running from room to room looking for her . I went into the bedroom and the bed wasn 't made up . I ran into the kitchen and the lunch dishes were still on the table . I just kept calling out to her . " Lydia ! Where are you ? " But , just silent , except for the sound of my heart beating . And then finally , I ran out into the back yard and ... there she was . And I know now it was probably just the afternoon sunlight , but ... she looked like she was glowing . She looked like ... Well , I guess what you figure an angel ... looks like . I ran up to her , tears streaming down my face and I threw my arms around her and I locked on to her for dear life . She laughed at me and held me tight and said : " David , what on earth is the matter with you ? " And I said ... And I said : " Promise me you will never die . " And she did . Mom ... I will miss you every day for the rest of my life . Come on , Dad . I 'll make you some dinner . That 's your mother 's job . She doesn 't like anybody else in the kitchen . Sure you don 't want any soup ? No . Me neither . You know , I never understood why my mother stayed with my father . She never told me . And I don 't think he ever be able to . Oh , I called an assited care service . And what do I need that for ? Just someone to have around the house and make things easier for you . I have a friend who is in a persistent vegetative state . He 's 18 now . Had a stroke while he was running . Now , I would bet my last pound that some of those people can hear and understand . See , that 's what I think . I think he 's closer to the surface than we thought . Do you really believe Glenn could wake up ? One step at a time . Salvador Charringa has over 10,000 acres of citrus groves outside Miami . The same Salvador Charringa who openly admits he helped finance the Bay of Pigs . This is what fifteen hundred of those acres looked like as of last week . What are we talking about ? Agricultural terrorism ? According to some experts , Florida could be on the verge of a plague of biblical proportions . We 'd like to know if it 's God 's will or Fidel 's ? I ask Weston if I could give a field agent a mission this week , and he said it will be alright . If you aren 't already online , take the NorBAC tour and I 'll give you all the details . Remember , only you know the whole story . Transcript : Raceman Subtitles : kubilai , Lama , Teuteu42

What ? this is Baltazar . 40th century . ever lived . just ... fantastic ! Yeah it 's kinda cool . the thing about Baltazar ... Scourge of the galaxy ! the most amazing thing about him is ... He forged this ship himself . He didn 't . Baltazar . I tended her by hand over countless decades . Burnished her into the greatest warship in history . blew all of Earth 's defence force from the sky . - You really shouldn 't have done that . - Shouldn 't have done that . And now I 'm gonna envelop Earth in a field of plasma fire . Super heat the carbonate who crawl across it 's surface . Really ? - making ... - Diamonds ! well done . every living being turned into diamonds . And the plan starts in seconds . Now that is a plan . a A plan . isn 't that not the most incredible plan you 've ever heard ? yeah ? this . What ? I 'll stir things up . Ouch ! Shouldn 't have done that ! And he shouldn 't have broken your spoon because ... That wasn 't just any old spoon . That spoon passed through the hands of the greatest chiefs of planet Earth ! Daelia . Madame Cholet . That spoon was an antique ! Forged by the now extinct inhabitants of a planet which specialized in ribicola . but not just any old fungus . a special hydroxiding fungus . There 's been no treatment for it for this last 200 years . scourge of the galaxy ... - Your deck is rusting away . - What ? NOOOOOO ! That 's not ordinary rust . a bit of vavavoom . Vavavoom ! Vavavoom ! not to the rust . well . Will Baltazar ever get caught ? I imagine so . his luck can 't hold out forever . So what will happen do you think ? the most likely prison planet for him would be ... Yeah ... Volagnok . that 's where I 'd take him if it was up to me . Coldest place in galaxy . Brrrr ! Nasty . Yep . give me a number between 0 and 99 . Forty five . And another . - 72 ? - Another . 3 ! What is this ? Galactic lottery ? Destination setting . have randomly chosen to take us to ...

Bill Oddie Heaven ! isn 't it ? Miss Martha . It 's Caw 's home . Miss Martha . all them years ago . it 's really lovely . about Baltazar ... Martha . why would they release him from prison ? Say he is reformed . But Caw reckons he is as bad as ever he was . sorry . - What d 'you need gold for ? - He eats it . Doctor . He seeks his heart 's desire . And knows how to find it . - He does ? - The Infinite . that 's just a legend . Or is ? Baltazar thinks different . Thinks he knows how to find it . - Find what ? - The Infinite . what exactly is the Infinite ? Martha . Things that predate all reality . Reliques from the dark times . a fairy tale . - Far far more than that . There was a time when the universe was so much smaller than it is now . all the time of chaos . and the great vampires back paged through the void . this is one of those reliques from the Dark Times ? they 'd receive their heart 's desire . And frankly that 's quite a thing to receive . but how 's Baltazar gonna find it ? - That 's how . - What 's that ? It 's a data chip . Part of the black box recorder . Dark Time technology . Baltazar gave it to me for safe keeping . Should be 4 of them . You need to use each one to find the next . you find the Infinite . Are we going on a quest then ? No . The Infinite stays lost . Nothing more than a legend . it 's my duty to see it stays that way . You mustn 't . Mustn 't . He 's got a copy . someone as corrupt and twisted as he is have access to that kind of power . you 'd better be right about this . go ! The tracker is in place . it 's really lovely . The Doctor is gonna find me the Infinite . He 's gonna find me my heart 's desire . Heart 's desire . Heart 's desire ! And then I 'll have my revenge ! revenge ! see those ? Artificial suns . Never . Someone wanted the planet Booken warmed up . What are they ? - Oil rigs . - Oil rigs ? they still need oil in the future . the Corporation went drilling elsewhere . look at them . You 'd think they 're alive . You think ? Run ? - What now ? - Well ... I 'm open to suggestions . Why did you that ? you 're brilliant ! now you 're just showing off . Mr. Mate ! aye ! Captain ! Let OilCorp see that the Black Gold is in business . aye ! Captain ! - Pirates ! - Pirates ? I 'm Swabb . First mate aboard the Black ... Mr Mate . Put her in reverse . aye ! Captain ! You two might want to hold on tight . To the rail ! aye ! Captain . me hearties ! lads ! Swabb . Maximum power ! Aye ! that I didn 't expect . Mr. Mate . then pull the rig in ? Swabb . Captain ... - Captain Kaliko . Hello . I 'm the Doctor . Martha and I ... Why are they smashing up the oil rigs ? I told it 's the 40th century . Last great oil corporations are sucking the solar system dry to feed demand . of course . And the colonies that can 't afford to pay are dying . Aye ! And the oil companies call us pirates . I see . but that 's brilliant ! Swabb . Captain . ya ! - A skeleton crew . - Literally . Less of a drain on rations . or planning a spot of pirating yourselves . none of the above . I don 't want you on the Black Gold . me heartless hearties ! Throw these sand lovers overboard ! lads . Swabb ! You Swabb ! Is this mutiny ! Yes ! mutiny . No . I just wondered if they be OilCorp spies . Mayhap we dispose of the bodies by putting them inside one of the oil rigs . Make it look like an accident . Mr. Mate . We 'll use the one we just keelhauled . aye ! Captain ! Doctor . Martha . You 're perfectly safe with me . What 's he up to ? I don 't think our Mr. Swabb is all he 's cracked up to be . I wonder . Doctor ? So ... um ... sorry . Let me see if I got this right . We somehow get inside this rig that you 've drained of oil ... and ... um ... then what ? the remaining oil ignites . boiled in oil . That 's murder ! me hearties ... the plank . uh-uh . Me first . I thought Swabb would have made his move by now . - What move ? - He 's no pirate . then my guess is ... too ? - Hmm . Fingers crossed . Ready ! Doctor . Shame you have to die . Yeah yeah yeah . or I 'll destroy your ship . What ? With that ? No deal . Kaliko . well . Why is it not working ? Patience . Sand ! In the mechanism . Hang on . Success ! And ? hold on tight ! Corp dog ! You 're damaging the Black Gold ! Captain . We came here to save you . Martha . The Captain 's pirate days are over . I 'm with OilCorp . Told you . And OilCorp have promised me a new body to replace this bag of bones . me hearties . If you 'll help me turn the Captain in . They 'll never turn on me . Oh . No . too . - You 're not ? - No . - You 're not ? - No . we 've come here to rescue you . Captain . Your time is up . attack ! Lucky they 're not great shots ! Define " lucky . No ! No ! More precision ! Fire with more ... Martha ! Doctor ? Doctor ? Forget it ! at least I can think of a good use for you . really ? - Yes . is that I get to choose a new body soon . And you know what ? I can see myself wearing yours . yeah . you . right ? a dead important one . stop this Baltazar guy from stealing spaceship called Infinite which will give him and that 's a bad thing because he 's not a nice bloke . - Swabb ? - Yeah ? And ... behind you . aye ! Oh ! Sorry . Doctor ! Will the vile dog live ? it probably broke his fall . I 'll get you for this ! he 's okay . could you ? you said you 'd come here for me . What exactly did you mean by that ? Captain . really ? you fool ! but seeing as you had an ulterior motive in rescuing me . There 's only room for one in my lifeboat anyhow . Looks like she came down near the TARDIS . We have to catch her . If Baltazar gets that chip and finds the Infinite ... me and Earth . Look ! no ! the fall couldn 't do that ? No . She 's been murdered . it seems . Doctor . Kaliko . Martha . Let 's see where we 're going next . Hang on ! Hang on ! There could be anything out there . Snakes like bendy buses . Sabre-toothed gorillas . Anything ! Excellent ! Right . That way is Main Street . is probably downtown . - Where 's the lights ? - Lights ? especially at night . Doctor ! They 're bugs ! So I see . And they 're about to swarm ! Doctor ! The bugs ! Swarming all around us ! Go on ! Get out of it ! What 's the matter with you two ? - Doctor . - I know . And what are you staring at ? uh ... - Mergrass . Ulysses Mergrass . Good thing the bugs listen to you . We have an understanding . I noticed . I 'm here to provide their community with protection . - What 's that ? - What they need protecting from . those are warplanes . What do you expect in a war zone ? A war zone ? Sonic attack . Incoming ! You know what ? I think he 's got the right idea . Martha ! Martha ! Look out ! isn 't it ? If you like that sort of thing . Careful ! Don 't touch what isn 't yours ... yet . Breakages must still be paid for . they won 't activate until I give your queen this key-coder to switch everything on . yeah . You all right ? Turns out the towers are built from dung . I 'm fine . It 's beautiful . Really beautiful . Well said . Martha Jones . the Mantasphid Queen . Martha Jones . - Your ... majesty ? - Spot on . these alien attackers ... Doctor . The bidding is over . I won . Doctor . We have our military advisor already . We do not need another . is it ? Interesting euphemism for gun running . - Gun running ? - In the crates . they 've caught a pilot ! Stand well back . I want to see what it is you 're fighting against . Oh . What are you ? Crush it ! Squash it ! Get it away from me ! I know ! it 's just frightened . Oh . oh ! Martha ! You are a marvel . hey . I 'm not going to hurt you . Thank you . Thank you so much . I ... Training didn 't prepare me . I didn 't ... Sh-sh . It 's all right . It 's all right . Calm down . You 're fine now . Sorry . Suit got damaged when I came down . No air left . I thought I was going to die . I don 't want to die . you didn 't . Fleshy biped . We must be protected from fleshy bipeds . Destroy them all ! your majesty with the weapons you bought . sir . what 's wrong with you ? Picking a fight with a bunch of defenceless bugs ? We didn 't start it ! they did ! The fleshy bipeds have been trying to exterminate us ! - Wipe us out ! - No ! You don 't understand ! This is Myarr ! brought up . We were here first ! Is this true ? This used to be a lovely place . My parents had a homestead here . the bugs arrived and drove all the people out . I only joined up once ... once my parents were killed . Killed ? Why ? Why did you attack ? So many lovely animals they had here . So much lovely dung . You invaded this planet for dung ? It 's one of the last fertile planets in the galaxy . there 'll be a famine like you wouldn 't believe . if I may ? My job here is done . I have supplied you with the means to destroy your enemies . Your contract stipulates final payment on delivery ? Did it ? Mergrass ? I lied ! There will be no payment . Mantasphids do not make deals with fleshy bipeds . Typical Mantasphid . I should have listened to the others . - What others ? - The prisoners . too . Tipped me off about this little war . So I decided to do the deal . You were in prison ? no . a dealer . I would get letters and gifts to the inmates and in return ... You got well paid ? Of course . but the governor always said that you could never trust a Mantasphid . perhaps ? Volagnok ? Isn 't that where Baltazar was ? You know of Baltazar ? The fly ships ! They 're coming back ! Bugs ! Defend us ! They 'll destroy us all ! unless we get out of here . Forget it . You can 't get far enough away . Why not ? Because Earth Command can 't afford to lose this planet . they 'll even sacrifice me . listen to me . There might still be a way . Doctor . is it not ? Never say die ? exactly ! Fleshy biped are very stupid creatures . But the fight goes on . We 'll win this war yet ! what will they do to the city ? the plan was spatial disintegration of this 100 mile vector . They 're going to burn us out of space and time . Kills all known bugs . Dead . So we stand here while they vaporize us ? what do we do ? - You 're asking me ? - You are my military advisor ! You know tactics . You know weapons . Help us ! I 'd have happily helped you when I thought I was getting paid . the weapons are useless . you get nothing . Mergrass ? Mergrass ! Come back ! We need to keep track of Mergrass . He has the data chip we need to continue this treasure hunt . It is decided . How do we ... surrender ... to the fleshy bipeds ? have you got a communication systems ? sir . But it was damaged when I crashed . we 'll soon have that sorted . hurry ! We want to surrender ! there 's no protocol for negotiation with the Mantasphids . Then make one ! killed our families . sentient beings that have a right to exist . but somewhere . Mastasphid hive destruction commences in sixty seconds . that 's not good . Doctor . Hurry . can 't we ? You are brilliant ! Pilot ! Tell them to open up a visual channel . this is Pilot Kelvin . Imperative you open a visual link to this helmet 's communication system now . Please respond . Roger . Doctor ! Earth Command nobodies ! pirate of the constellations giving you a big white fla-a-ag ! me and me mad mucker Martha here ... Arg ! Arg-Arg ! don 't ? don 't do that . held their queenie hostage ! you got us beaten . Come on in and get us . We surrender ! Arr ! That should do it . Doctor ? Queenie . Ended your war . you reckon ? hive destruction cancelled . Your priority now is to apprehend male human . Doctor Vile . Doctor ? not against them . Young Kelvin here could make a great ambassador . - Me ? - Now . right ? And you 're naturally phosphorescent . Think you can make a deal ? You 'll get all the dung you could ever want ! Brilliant ! what 's next ? We skedaddle out of here before Kelvin 's mates arrive . everyone ! What now ? Catch up with Mergrass and go ? we 've found him . no ! Sudden dehydration . Take the data chip and let 's go . We can 't just leave him . It 's like Captain Kaliko all over again . Isn 't it just . we can 't stay . We 're criminals remember ? Next data chip located . It 's ... oh . - Where ? Is it bad ? - Are you wearing thermals ? you ! Where are we going ? full stop ? we 've now met two people from the prison on Volagnok . - Right ? - Right . But there 's no prison here . You were saying ? Doctor ! I thought you 'd never get here ! mind ! - Hoy-ya ! - This item is confiscated . What ? Scanning for malfeasance . No convictions . No confirmation of criminal activity . obviously . Scanning . Three thousand and five outstanding convictions . That many ? - With six thousand more ... - Doctor ! It 's an unfair cop ! Prison cell 8-4-4-7 . Doctor ! The governor will see you now . good . Great . I think . Ooh . Hello . You 're clearly an android . And I 'm your new cellmate . You all right ? It hurts . I 'm the Doctor . Tell me the trouble . Interesting . You the governor here ? There 's been a terrible mistake . We don 't make mistakes on Volagnok . Safe ! But my friend 's ... been ... Close . You were saying ? I ... your friend . but he 's been a very naughty boy . fourteen hundred counts . two hundred and fifty counts . that 's nothing serious . Planetary demolition ? eighteen . - Ouch . - And all dating back three thousand years . I 'm sure he has his reasons . but these charges have been extracted from his own brain . He knows what he 's guilty of . And they 've earned him ... Let 's see now ... Two billion years in prison . Two billion ! He really should have taken back those library books . there 's more . wanted for piracy . As well as his accomplice ... You ! Caw then said ... Did I mention Caw before ? the legendary starship that has the power to create your heart 's desire . You might know Baltazar . sorry . Sorry . Hang on . You 've been inhibited . I have . You couldn 't commit a crime if you tried . I could not . I 'm not having this . Yeah ! we 'll have to dig our way out . Don 't suppose you concealed a teaspoon ? I lost mine . There is a more direct way . Now . What was that ? what 's up with the lights ? Governor . A cell has been opened from within . Opened ? Where ? Cell 8-4-4-7 . That cell is off limits ! Didn 't your tin pet there put the Doctor in cell 8-4-4-7 ? No ! I gave explicit orders no one was to be put in with the gover ... were you going to say ? who are you ! Don 't you get it ? He 's escaped . Your friend 's let him out . Doctor . No . What 's doing that ? Locke . Martha Jones ! You 'll never guess who I 'm with . Hmm . The real governor ? who are you ? Warder ! You don 't know what you 've done . Letting him out . Hang on . Hang on . Hold this for a moment will you ? But there 's nothing on it . prisoner . blah-blah-blah . Released . Released ! I did my time . I got let out . I broke back in . That 's new . Why ? Because of him ! Living here in luxury . He 's an android . He doesn 't even need it . But me ? There are people across the seven galaxies who still want my head on a plate . Putting my face on wanted posters . Preferably dead . Close brackets . Yeah . I get the picture . There was this guy I met . Sold me a nifty little program on the warders . They saw me as Locke and Locke as me . by any chance ? You know him ! I kept Locke safely locked up until you came along . Free . At last . Gurney . we had a deal . No deals . Creatures like Gurney are beyond redemption . Their rehabilitation is pointless . Warder . All the prisoners in Volagnok are beyond rehabilitation . They must die . Commencing self-sterilization on your command . - You can 't ! - Stop it ! Stop it now . - It 's not their fault . - It 's the only way to cure them . Safe ! It 's the only way . It 's the only way . Doctor ! The prisoners ! I 'm on it . how do we stop the killing ? I need that program Mergrass sold you so the warders don 't take Locke 's orders anymore . Doctor . I 'm getting out of here . - The data chip ! - Gurney ! Stop ! Stop ! It 's the only way . Order terminated . yes ! Skill ! where 's me sonic screwdriver ? Mind . You 'll do yourself a damage . Gurney . - I 've got to get away from here ! Gurney ? Gurney ? aren 't ya ? - Take me with you in your ship . - I can 't fly the TARDIS . are ... It can 't be . What ? Revenge ! Finally ! Baltazar . The final data chip at last ! no ! Caw ! you don 't ! Caw ? Miss Martha . Caw 's been a dirty birdie . weren 't you ? You sent us on this hunt for the data chips on his orders ? I 'm sorry . see ? He promised me all the gold I could eat . Caw . Gurney . He got me right in the fusion chamber . now . There must be something I can do . There 's not . listen . We have to help him . please . Caw runs on gold fusion . that 's it . Va-va-voom . Caw ? Caw ! Doctor . We have some unfinished business . Get in ! Turn around . Hands in the air ! So how 'd you find us ? It 's very tricky to track a TARDIS . I had insider information . Have you met Squawk ? My broach ! This little accessory has helped me track you every step of the way . birdie . - Squawk ! An accessory to murder . Doctor ? You needed a little bit of help collecting the data chips . would never willingly give you theirs . First there was Kaliko . Then there was Mergrass . he dried up very quickly . And that is Gurney 's . Pick it up . isn 't it ? You knew only my TARDIS could track each data chip from planet to planet . I knew only you would have something that could read data chips older than recorded history itself . Off you go . - The Hesperus Galaxy . - Next . Uh ... and that 'll be the Ceres System . It 's a map ! Telling us the location of the Infinite . Keep going . B. Set the controls . We 're going . This isn 't a taxi ! Set the controls or Miss Martha gets skewered . a legend . destroy you . Doctor . set the controls ! That 's the course laid in ? Yes . And all you have to do is push the button ? more or less . do I ? Uh ... oh ... No ! Doctor ! Martha ? No ! No ! Martha ? Martha ! He 'll . Be . Back ! alone in the cold . We won 't be seeing him again for a while . Not before I get my heart 's desire anyway . She 's huge ! The wreck of the Infinite . At last . She was smashed to bits centuries back . Flotsam spread out over half the galaxy . Mergrass and Gurney had all come by bits of the flight recorder . and they wouldn 't share them with you ? Not even with each other . I guess " X " marks the spot ? In you go . You 're looking for the hold . The hold ? Wouldn 't that be ... Down . Yep . Diagnosis : no bones broken . that 's something . Hello ? Hello ? Hello . Doctor ! I knew it ! I knew you 'd be back ! Wait a minute ? How ? Girl ? Girly ? Martha ? Watch out below ! What ? Ahoy there ! Meet Squawk . All grown up now ! Squawk ! we haven 't ... we haven 't ... quite got the hang of landing yet ! Doctor ? Out for the counts Squawk . at least . Doctor says you 're a bad influence . Like you were with my dad . I have exactly what you need . Gold . glittering gold . Keep you fed for years . Wait . What do I keep on telling you ? Don 't listen to the villains ! That ... hurt . Where is she ? Where 's Martha ? what about the treasure ? The heart 's desire . Of course . You 're not the Doctor . indeed . you have it . no ! Nooooo ! I think that 's my friend you 're scaring . Hiya . Can you make him go away ? I 'm afraid . You conjured him up . how am I supposed to ? Heart 's desire . I don 't believe I walked into this . Gotcha ! I said : " I don 't believe this ! yes ! don 't even try to find my heart 's desire . you ! - Proper you . - Ha ! then . Aren 't you going to ask me how I got here ? And hear about my adventures on Volagnok ? and reprogrammed Locke to run a better prison ? you know ? Three years ? two and three quarters . of course . Light speed ! How ? I gave Squawk 's engine a little bit of pep . bit of ... - Va-va-voom ? - Yeah . - I knew you 'd be back . this is the Infinite . Every pirate and freebooter and treasure hunter dreams of being the one to find this . Their heart 's desire . by the way ? Doesn 't matter . Didn 't work on me . Anyway whatever power this place once had is fading away daily . The whole ship is only held together by wishes and hopes . is there ? Not now . alone and lost . Screaming its rage and fury into the solitude until its unique power dissipated . Just left a little fading echo . Enough to give us a glimpse of our heart 's desire . no . Gold ! Diamonds ! Doctor . Enough treasure to buy me a new ship . Volagnok and everything in between . be Scourge of the Galaxy again ? Is that the best you can think of ? It 's not real . It 's just an echo of the power . Martha . just held together by wishful thinking . What ? Captain Useless ! full up . There 'll be another one along in a minute . You can 't leave me here ! but still ... I left him a way out . - Squawk ! - Squawk ! It 'd only matter if I didn 't know exactly where Squawk was going to drop him off . Doctor ! Curse you ! never been all it 's cracked up to be . Martha Jones ! Another job for you . yes ? Yes . Start giving me some random numbers . not again . Come on ! It will be fun ! When have I ever let you down ? ~ Bad Wolf Team ~

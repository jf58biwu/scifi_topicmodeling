 - You wanna stay with me ? - I 'd like that . - I have Alzheimer 's disease . - I know . - I don 't want it . - I don 't want you to have it either . - How do we test it ? - On my dad . He might die within a month , or a week . You prepared to do that to your father ? If these soldiers don 't get better we 'll have to call up more troupes . They need us in the Oval , now . If we don 't stop this , all hell 's gonna break loose . Headaches , flu-like symptoms , blurred vision , severe muscle pain and then the psychosis . - What you 've got the cure ? - I do indeed ! I would really love to take a look at what 's in that vial . - I can be up there tomorrow . - Great . All the Guardsmen have Lethargica located at 11P43 on the genome . The question isn 't how it 's spread ... The question is : what woke it up ? We came up with a plan to make our soldiers in Iraq sick . But they would come home and we would save them . We didn 't want to hurt anyone . - Who isn 't involved in this ? - It 's the Middle East . Whoever controls it , controls the future . I thought Wes was fired . He is , it 's his last day . First it 's Al-Qaida , then it 's Jewish Fundamentalists , now some Christian at the White House . Wes ! McGuinn has spun this every way but loose . - Why did you tell McGuinn I fired you ? - I didn 't . I 'm so sorry David . You were right about McGuinn . If one can get the Muslims and the Jews to go at each other 's throats , the US can just walk in to clean up the chaos . How did we fall into such a mess ? - How much further ? - There it is . Relax , Bob . We 're here . Wherever the hell " here " is . - Sandstrom ? - Hicks ? - Yeah , thanks for coming . - Bob Melnikov ! So we 've been investigating a little over 36 hours now . - Too long to be where we 're at . - Which is ? " Which is " why you 're here . We got more questions than answers . The car is registered to a Leslie McCaine but we haven 't got a positive I.D. on the body yet . She was so young . Just got her PhD in biochemistry . M.I.T. they tell me . I 'm gonna need to take some tissue samples for DNA matches . Our forensic team took care of that . We want you to concentrate on the lab . I 'm gonna need to take some tissue samples for DNA matches . It 's kind of a thing with Dr. Melnikov . He only trusts his own DNA tests . Can 't blame him after that whole O.J. thing , eh ? I guess I can arrange it with the coroner . So you boys ready for the main event ? Yeah . We think it went up at the same time as the car . - You think that 's just a coincidence ? - Wouldn 't be here if I did . Jesus ! Bodies we pulled out of here were in the same shape as the one outside . - That hot , eh ? - Oh yeah . Structural deformations , char depths ... All indicated the fire had multiple points of origin . You got one over here . One here . One over there . Couple in the other room . Textbook arson scenario . - Except for one thing . - What 's that ? Accelerants . Chem team couldn 't find anything . Gasoline , kerosene , turpentine . Nothing . So what are these ? What started the fire ? Which is why we 're here . I understand you had a little problem up in Canada too . Somebody help me ! Eight of our friends were killed in the explosion , 15 were seriously injured . Yeah , we had a little problem up in Canada too . ReGenesis 3x01 A Spontaneous Moment 3x02 Dust in the Wind Subtitles Team NorBAC Synchro Bbsiocnarf , Goufrach , Lama , Lovechange , NikoMagnus Version NoTag 1.0 What do you gotta do to get a signal out here ? Go outside . Try the north side of the building . Fuck it . What can you tell me about this place ? Well , last year Greenway was an open book . Mainly applying for grants in leading-edge bioengineering . About 6 months ago , they were contracted under some kind of secrecy clause and the door was slammed shut . Looks like somebody wanted to make sure that door stayed shut . It could have been an accident . Maybe in here , Bob . But the same kind of accident outside ? No . Somebody took these people out . I guess . Yeah , I guess so . Bob , have a look at this . What do you think ? Electrolysis . They were definitely experimenting using electrolysis . That 's not exactly cutting-edge science . Well , maybe they were working with a volatile material . We catalogued every piece of equipment , every drug , liquid , chemical , that survived the fire . This place is as benign as a high school lab . What else you got ? This is about the only place that didn 't get hammered . My guys fired up a portable generator to keep this stuff from turning to goo . - Good thinking . - I love cold rooms . They 're so quiet . - They tell me we got a room full of ... - Cyanobacteria . - Pond scum . - Yeah , algae . That 's what my guys told me . So . That 's the 10-cent tour , fellas . That 's it ? There 's no other storage lockers or isolation rooms , hazardous waste disposal systems ? Files , hard drives , lab books . All went up in smoke . So 6 dead scientists in a top-secret lab doing grade 9 experiments in the middle of nowhere . What the hell is going on ? - You hear anything from David ? - No , nothing yet . Hey . Did you read the ATF report on Greenway ? - Yes , I did . - And , do you think it was intentional ? Let 's wait and see what David has to say . They brought us into this because they think there might be a connection . I don 't know . It could have just been an accident . Oh , come on ! You believe that ? - Let 's not jump to any conclusions . - Well , I haven 't jumped ... yet . - ... anything from David ? - No , nothing yet . You have a minute ? You bet . What 's up ? Rachel , you 're new but I need to talk about this requisition for a DNA test . I wanted to do a haplotype , just to be as accurate as possible . We do those in-house . I guess I 'll have to reread that orientation manual , huh ? Is this about the Greenway labs ? No , this is ... This is something I 'm doing on my own . - On your own ? - I hope that 's alright ? It 's a ... Good friends of ours back in Georgetown , their son Tyler was assaulted , last month just before I moved up here , and ... Is he okay ? Well no , he never regained consciousness , so ... I 'm sorry . We 're all having a hard time with it . Anyway , he and my son Jeff have been friends forever , and .. That 's gotta be tough . Wes there ? - I 'm here . - Call for Caroline Morrison on line 3 . I 'll be there in a second . - Take a walk with me . - Yeah . You know , the frustrating thing is ... the police had a suspect in custody ... A security camera caught her shoving him down a flight of stairs . - Caught her ? - Yeah . D.C. Senator 's daughter , Julie Henshaw . She 's 17 , a year ahead of Tyler and Jeff at school . - Why 'd she do it ? - Well , Tyler was very ... He was fairly open about his sexual orientation , his politics , a lot of stuff Julie didn 't like , apparently . - So she shoved him down the stairs ? - And then she spit on him , but ... - Why is this girl not in jail ? - Well , it 's the spit . The police ran a DNA . Didn 't match Julie 's . And Mary and Harmon are ... That 's Tyler 's parents . They 're convinced that there 's been a mistake . So I offered to redo the test for them . - Just tell David what you 're doing . - What ? Do you think he cares ? No . But he likes to feel he 's in charge . Does anybody know anything about these guys ? Read any papers by ' em ? And this is Leslie Ann McCaine , the most senior of the group . PhD in Biochemistry , graduated in 2004 . She was the one in the car . Louis Prasse . University of Buffalo . PhD in Chemistry . Graduated last year . There 's not much to know , David . 6 PhDs . Greenway was their first job . No , Wes , it was their last job . Did Bob find out anything at the morgue ? I don 't know , he just got back . Bob , get the samples ? I did , but it wasn 't easy . I had a hard time finding intact tissue . - What was the condition of the bodies ? - Well , they were ... 100 % body-surface burns and on the inside they were ... They were toast , Mayko . What about the cyanobacteria ? I 've catalogued and shipped 73 different species , electrolysis plates , and scrapings from the flash points in the lab . Okay that 's it . These guys found something , invented something , did something that buried them . We find what it was , we might get closer to what killed them . See you tomorrow . - Tell me you 're gonna figure this out . - This is Mr. McCaine . The husband of the young woman ... - The woman who the car 's registered to . - The woman who died in that ... Why won 't anyone tell me , any of us , what happened out here ? - We don 't have any answer . - Mr McCaine , we 're doing our best . Your wife , Leslie . She was a microbial bacteriologist . Did she say anything - about what she was working on ? - She couldn 't . Oh God , she wanted to . She 'd come home all pumped up . So excited . We think they were working on electrolysis . Production of chemical changes by the passage of current through electrolyte . They were so naive . They thought their secret could change the world . Well , that secret 's probably what- - ... Killed them . I know that . The money guys here , they don 't give a shit . - To them , it 's about the bottom line . - Sorry , we gotta go . We have to go now . If you think of anything , you can reach us here . I 'm sorry . Bye . - How 's it going ? - Good . I 'll be finished these DNA samples tonight . Good . David and Bob should be in in the morning . And those samples should be here from Greenway lab in a couple of hours . I 'll be ready to go to work on them . You should maybe go home and get some sleep . David 's gonna work everybody pretty hard tomorrow . How are you doing ? You look beat . That call for Caroline , earlier , it was ... She 's been gone for 6 months but ... I don 't know ... it 's still a shock . Yeah , I can imagine . I mean , I don 't know how you guys dealt with that , the bombing and the ... Everybody has their own way of working through it , I guess . The funny thing is that that phone call was ... It 's from her vet . Because her dog needs his shots . And the thing is , after all those years , I didn 't know that sh ... She had a dog . I 'll see you in the morning . Wes . No dogs . One cat . Two sons . So , what do you think of her ? - Her ? - Yeah , it 's the girl downstairs . She 's been posing for me . Beautiful woman , David . Smart . Runs a restaurant in Cabbagetown . Loves to get naked . Sounds like the two of you have a lot in common . I never ran a restaurant in my life . What are you doing ? Got a headache . So , how 'd it go in ... Where were you ? Montana ? Utah . Six dead and a lot of soot . Think they 're trying to shut people up ? - The way they shut you up ? - Nobody shut me up , Dad ! So do you believe it was a deliberate attack ? Who destroyed your lab , Dr. Sandstrom ? Was it terrorism ? The bombing at NorBAC was investigated by the Metro police and the RCMP . - The conclusion is ... - Bullshit ! You want the truth ? - You talk to Washington ! - He believed God was talking to him . Now , please give us a bit of privacy . I 'll release a statement later . Nobody shut me up . You shut yourself up . - How are you doing ? - Great ! Went for a walk today . Played a little chess in the park . Won 2 out of 3 . Any headaches ? Fine , I 'm fine . When are you gonna admit it ? You succeeded . You cured my Alzheimer 's . Cured ? I don 't know about that . Maybe slowed it down a little bit but ... It works . Patent it , put it on the market . One step at a time , okay ? What 's the hell with that ? Fuck , I 'm tired . So go to bed . You worry too much anyway . I will stay up for a little while , while I still have that pretty girl in my head . Okay . Dad ? Go to bed . Any headaches ? - The conclusion is ... - Bullshit ! - You shut yourself up . - Nobody shut me up , dad . This is Nodularia . - Nickel . - Thank you . - Chromium . - Thank you . So , what are your son 's names ? Craig . He 's 22 . He 's doing wildlife surveys for the Department of Parks and Forestry . He 's my restless soul . - This is magnesium . - Thank you . And Jeff is 16 . Conveniently parked at Hamstead . The boarding school in DC . You don 't want him there ? I don 't ... I don 't know . I mean ... I guess maybe it 's for the best . He gets a little shelter from the storm . I 'm in ... the middle of a messy divorce . " Storms make oaks take deeper roots . " George Herbert . My favourite metaphysical poet . - Iron . - Thank you . You okay ? Gassy . Better everyday . Could we take a break ? Maybe a short one . Might be a good idea . What are you doing ? We 're mirroring their experiments . 16 different metals , 73 kinds of cyanobacteria . That 's 1,168 possible combinations of electrolysis . I meant what are you doing out here ? It 's going to take them minute to get started . - So why aren 't you in there doing it ? - Because we 're taking a break . - Make it a short one . - David ! - Figure a cup of coffee 's a short one ? - Instant . Ultraviolet , infrared , and magnetic resonance spectroscopy - all agree with the ATF findings . - No accelerant ? Nothing in the lab . No gas leaks , no electrical shorts . - What about the car ? - Gasoline all over . ATF attributes it to the tank exploding after the fire started . Hard to disagree . - No cordite ? No ... - There was no bomb , David . What the hell lit them up ? - You got a minute ? - I 'm running out of tests . I 've been going through all funding requests on Greenway . Check this out . So in may , they applied for money to build a staircase using piezoelectric technology in the risers . - Piezoelectric ? - Certain crystals , when you apply pressure to them , like stepping on them , they generate voltage . They wanted to power a building with a staircase ? It 's pretty cool ? Didn 't get any takers though . Okay , and then before that , they were presenting a project to Israel 's Public Utilities Authority about a 5-square kilometre array of next-generation solar panels in the Negev desert . So they were into alternative energy . Why all the secrecy ? The secrecy only started 6 months ago when they got 72 million from a company called Auflander Docheimer . - Who ? - Auflander Docheimer . From what I can tell , they 're venture capitalists . Pouring money into microbial fuel cells , human cloning , nano replication , all the glam scams . Okay . So 72 million , alternative energy , secrecy . What the fuck ? Were they turning pond scum into gold ? Well , that I couldn 't google . And Auchtung , what do they have to say ? I can 't find them . They 're registered in the Caymans . Oh , and David get this , the board of directors is loaded with ex-Pentagon and CIA brass . Oh fuck . Here we go again . So Greenway comes up with an alternative fuel source , Big Oil gets wind of it , Big Oil 's not happy and " boom " up goes the lab . Take the information . Get rid of the informers . Information is power , baby . Here 's what I want you to do . Go to Wes ... Fuck it , I 'll go . Wes ! I want to speak to somebody at Auflander Docheimer . - Okay . - Now . How do you spell that ? N-O-W ! Is there anyone in particular you 'd like to speak to at this organization ? Let 's get something straight , Wes . You got one job and that 's to do what I tell you . Find these guys . You have a real gift for pissing people off . And when people get pissed off , they tend to go away . As in take the financing for all your little toys and go home . Then why are you still here ? Because I 'm the interim director at NorBAC , David . I clean up the mess . You 're not Caroline Morrison . David , are you ready ? Yeah , sure . I spoke to Bob . His surgery went well . He says he 's sorry he couldn 't be here . A lot of people are sorry . So when are we going to Washington , Wes ? What do you mean ? I mean , when are we going to Washington to get to the truth - about what happened at the lab ? - I 'm working on it . I want the truth , Wes . The truth is , it was a lone terrorist act . David ... I mean the real fucking truth , asshole ! Who gave the order , Wes ? ! Why 'd they blow up the lab ? ! You know ! - You know ! - Relax . - I 'll find Auflander Docheimer . - Thank you . So what happened ? I thought you had training to kill me with your bare hands . With a finger . Well , thanks for holding back . No . I don 't give a shit how long it takes , Wes . We have got to get the fuckers that did this . We 've got nothing that ties Washington to the bombing . They played us . They fuckin ' played us . You can 't believe that guy acted alone . - It doesn 't matter what I believe . - You don 't want the truth ? Fine . Which truth would you like ? A lone gunman with Allah whispering in his ear ? A rogue cabal in the Pentagon that wants to control the middle east ? Evangelicals in the White House waiting for the second coming ? All of them working together ? You can pick . Whichever way it plays out , someone wanted NorBAC shut down . That still doesn 't tell me why . What difference does it make ? Camelot is gone , and the Towers are rubble . So , what ? That 's it ? We just turn our backs , we give up ? Yeah . And you know why ? Because you 'll never know the truth . The truth is buried with McGuinn . And if you don 't learn to move on , you 're gonna turn around and look in the mirror , and you 're gonna see a paranoid son-of-a-bitch who jumps at shadows . And that 's how people lose it , David . - It 's about the burned victims . - Yeah . What about ' em ? I was having trouble getting DNA that wasn 't degraded by the fire . - Yeah , you were gonna go deeper . - Well , that 's just it . I began to realize that the deeper I went into the bodies , the more degraded the DNA became . Which is exactly the opposite of what you see in normal burn victims . The least damaged samples were closer to the epidermis . Are you saying these people burned from the inside out ? Almost like they were cooked in a microwave oven . Or like they spontaneously ... The point is , we do have evidence that fire started within the victim 's bodies . And then I think they exploded . Which would explain those flash points , burning tissue , blood hits , the walls , the floors . The fire totally degrades them . So , to the arson investigators , it looks like there is no trace of an accelerant . When in fact it may have been the scientists themselves . In theory . - Make it real . - Okay . What ? Hello Doctor Sandstrom , it 's Robbie McCaine . I came down to the lab looking for Agent Hicks . Oh right . I think he finished out there . So where is this investigation going ? It 's going a lot of places . We 're looking into alternative fuels and ... we 're looking to see if maybe it was an accident , or ... a premeditated , you know , intervention . We 'll let you know when we narrow it down . - I have something . - I 'm all ears . I had to go through Leslie 's safe-deposit box . There was a contract in there . It 's with a numbered company . Yeah , we know , in the Cayman Islands . - No , this is with a company in Zurich . - Got a name ? Guy who signed the contract 's , Titus Muyrbridge . Okay , can you hang on a sec . Can you spell that for me ? Go ahead . M-u-y-r-bridge . - Here 's the guy . - What guy ? - The guy who bankrolled Greenway . - Where is he ? - Zurich maybe . - Titus Muyrbridge . Find him . Everybody 's waiting for you in the conference room . We 've gone over everything , we 've come up with a few ideas . We think the scientists at Greenway found a way to turn ordinary pond scum into a renewable pollution-free source of fuel . Is that possible ? We know Greenway was working on alternative energy sources , and we know they were working on cyanobacteria . And cyanobacteria , as part of their existence , releases hydrogen into the environment . And hydrogen is the Holy Grail of alternative energy sources . The problem is , in nature , cyanobacteria releases nowhere near enough hydrogen to cause the sort of damage we saw over Greenway . So they amped it up , that it ? They actually succeeded ? Well , that 's what we 're thinking , but we don 't know how . But all the pieces fit . You 've got explosive hydrogen - and a series of mysterious fires . - Okay , so ... What went wrong ? Something happened inside that lab . While working with the cyanobacteria somehow they must have ingested some of it and it began to process the water inside their bodies . Splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen . The hydrogen reached a critical level and then anything , a random spark , static electricity , could 've ignited it . Think Hindenburg . We 'll get back to you on the science . What do you mean you 're not hungry ? You eat for me . Talk to me about that lab . What do you wanna know ? What happened ? They blow themselves up ? I suppose it 's possible that they fucked up . So they made a mistake trying to do something good ? You gotta take a chance sometime , right ? What would 've happened if you hadn 't given me those prion injections ? Dad , I want you to know that ... what I did ... the decision I made ... that was the hardest thing I 've ever done in my life . But I wanted you to do it . I told you to do it , right ? Yeah . And it 's fine , David . It 's all gone . Everything I had is gone . And it 'll be fine ... in Paris , in Spain , in St. Tropez . I haven 't been there in years . No . You ... You can 't go . I need you here . I 've gotta do blood work and I have to watch your progress . And I still have a paper to write . How ' bout I just write you a letter ? Dad , I 'm not letting you go ! I thought you hated me . - What are you doing ? - I got another headache . I 'm tired . I just don 't want to keep going over this , okay ? Why can 't we just let it go ? Goddamit , you 're not going anywhere ! David ... You don 't have a say . - Hello , Harmon ? - Hi . - Hey , it 's Rachel . - How are you , Rachel ? Yeah , I 'm fine . How are you two doing ? - We 're taking it a day at a time . - How 's Mary ? I just dropped her off at the airport . She goes to Miami to see her sister . - She 's having a hard time . - I 'll bet . - You have the test results ? - I do . Harmon , I used the most sophisticated DNA tests available . These things compare hundreds of thousands of DNA features . That 's better than what the police did ? Times a thousand . I compared the DNA in the blood taken from the suspect with DNA found in the saliva on Tyler 's body . Rachel . Did she kill my son ? If I had to testify under oath , I would have to say ... that was not Julie Henshaw 's saliva . Harmon ? Did you look at the tapes ? Grainy security footage can be misinterpreted . DNA can 't . I looked at it a 100 times , Rachel . I close my eyes and I see that girl . I know this is not what you wanted to hear . I know , I know . We appreciate your help , Rachel . - I 'll tell Mary . - Take care . Hey , how 's it going ? I 'm getting some reactions , but nothing in line with our hypothesis . We can start scraping the probes . - You okay ? - Yeah , fine . You should talk to David about it . That 's what I 'd do . Maybe I 'll talk to him in the morning . - He 's in the lounge . - Didn 't he go home ? He came back while you were on the phone . He said he couldn 't sleep . He 's on a bit of a rough road these days , isn 't he ? David tends to live in a world of hysterical realism expressing himself through colourful language . That 's just my theory . - So you think he 'd give me some advice ? - Oh sure ... I think ... Maybe ... Depends . - I 'll be back in a minute . - Take your time . - Oh shit . Stop . - What happened ? - It just started smoking and ... David . You set the timer for 30 minutes . 3 min ... Shit . Well , I guess you could just avoid the black stuff , but ... I thought you went home . It 's hard to be there sometimes . My dad ... - If he 's anything like my dad ... - I don 't want to talk about it now . He just pushes my buttons . Can I get your advice about something or are you in too foul of a mood ? Sorry . Sure . That 's the girl , Julie Henshaw , going into the boy 's dorm . - Boyfriend ? - Yeah . Claims she was with him entire time . Now I checked the entire tape . No other girl came in or out of the dorm . I was known to slip through a few dorm windows in my day . Well now , thanks to juvenile delinquents like you , doors and windows are secured , barred , and alarmed all over America . And that 's her leaving exactly 23 minutes later . All right , this next part gets a little intense . I 'm a big boy . Jesus . She spit on him . I was his godmother , David . Maybe it was a guy dressed up to look like a girl . The DNA was female . How do you dress that up ? Did you take the swab ? - No , DC Police took the blood sample . - You sure it was hers ? I don 't know . Maybe you need to get a new sample . But legally Julie Henshaw does not have to submit to another blood test . One thing you should know about working in my lab ... getting to the truth is a little higher up the ladder than colouring inside the lines . If it was me , I 'd go to Washington , get my own fucking sample . Yeah ? Bob ! Bob , get out of there ! Come on . Come on , get outta there . I had one more sample to go , I wanted to finish up . I had 10 electrodes going and I lit the burner to sterilize the loop - and everything flashed . - Bob ! I 'm fine . Something suddenly just happened . Like something suddenly just happened in that lab . Cyanobacteria . Bob , what 's the last cyanobacteria you were working on ? Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii 1123-4 . We 'll just call him 1123-4 . Now , Cyanobacteria just need 2 things to be happy , right ? They need food . Which can be nitrogen , carbon , any minerals they can find and energy . Sunshine , out in the big wide world . In the Greenway lab , they replaced the sun with an iron electrode attached to a power pack . And ? And that was the hydrogen going up . Splitting from the oxygen right out of the water . One thousand times faster than any ever before . Wait , that 's not natural , more like impossible . What 'd they do to it ? So U of T sent over electron microscope pictures of the sample that lit up and we are definitely on to something . Okay , everything looks normal . Right ? - Except for ... - That 's what I was hoping for , - right there . - Some sort of metal , I 'm not sure what . My guess , it 's not supposed to be there . You are looking at customized pond scum . 1123-4 . It 's not what they called the cyanobacteria . It 's their code for these fucking dots . They bioengineered them onto the cell . - You get a chemical analysis ? - The dots are nano scale , so if you want a complete atomic analysis , - we need a synchrotron . - Then get one . - Sure . What 's a synchrotron ? - Like an X-ray machine on steroids . Saskatoon has a brand new one . - I 'll see what I can do . - Okay . Now wait a minute . 1123 needs energy to survive . So , where 's the e-power-pack in the scientist ? - The current between the nerve cells ? - Too small . - Static electricity ? - Electrolysis needs a sustained charge . - Fuck ! Mayko , you coordinate with Saskatchewan . We have to find out what these nanodots are . The rest of us ... If cyanobacteria even survives in the scientists it needs a power source . Okay , let 's find it . Damn . - Hey , Bob . - Hi , Rachel . You know , I don 't understand why David won 't entertain some of my more esoteric theories : spontaous combustion , red rain , Morgellons Disease . We 're routinely involved in strange occurrences , I don 't see why ... How have you been feeling since you 've been back ? I 'm not a very good traveller and planes bother me . They dehydrate me . Why ? Nothing , just developing an esoteric theory of my own . - Carlos . Do you have a minute ? - Sure . How do you think that 1123-4 is being transmitted ? - Water supply , physical contact . - Airborne ? - Could be . Why ? - Could ? I don 't know . I 'm just gonna go talk to David . You find the power source ? What if some cyanobacteria survived that fire ? You and Bob were there . Shit . Call Agent Hicks . Tell him to test everybody fluid on all ATF personnel , firemen , anyone who went near that lab will have to be tested , starting with me . Synchrotron analysis of the nanodots came back . - Iron . Right ? - Right . A very reactive iron compound . It would be . It 's a catalyst . That 's got to be it . - Conference room . - Good work , Mayko . A top-secret lab in the middle of nowhere , staffed by a bunch of ... kids , completely out of their depth and focused on finding an efficient way of splitting hydrogen gas from water . - That 's tough to do . - Because ? It takes more energy to split the hydrogen from the oxygen than the entire process can produce . It 's like throwing down 5 bucks to buy a buck . So Greenway starts from scratch . Okay ? Pond scum . But to make any economic sense , they 've gotta improve a little on Mother Nature . Greenway genetically engineered cyanobacteria - to be more efficient . - A lot more efficient . - How ? - These nanodots on the skin 's cell . They 're made of iron . 1123-4 grows them . Bioengineered . How do they do it ? The iron nanodots act as catalysts allowing the bacteria to separate hydrogen from water using less energy . A lot less energy in a lot less time . Now 10 cents buys you a buck . It would take 1,377,000 years for a normal cyanobacteria to releases as much hydrogen as one modified can in less than 20 minutes . So if that got out , into the environment , - there 'd be no way to control it . - That 's right . And with the wind to carry it , 1123-4 can go wherever and wherever it lands , it 'll start to feed and grow continuously breaking down every water molecule it comes across , until the planet is one big cloud of hydrogen gas waiting to blow . 'Cause it has the biggest battery pack in the world strapped to it . - The sun . - That 's right . So the question is : " Did it survive the fire ? " Did it get out ? Salt Lake Power 's ruled out any possibility of a gas leak . What do they think ? Somebody turned water into 200-proof gin ? They dont know . They 've turned it over to ATF . They dont have a clue what 's going on . How far from Greenway lab is this pool ? - About 4 kilometres . - Anybody hurt ? - No . Everyone was fine . - Tell ATF if they want to be helpful , they can send us soil samples from an 8km radius of the lab . You think 11234 could travel that far from lab ? Dust in the wind , Wes . You tell me . I 'll ask for a 10k radius . What happened to all the bottled water ? You can have mine . - Are you feeling dehydred ? - Yes . You think the cyanobacteria is turnin our fluids into hydrogen gas ? Fuck what ? No ! You don 't think that 's what happened to scientists ? We dont know what happened to scientists . Yes we do . They combusted . Cyanobacteria needs a power source . It needs energy in order to turn water into hydrogen gas . There 's no ball of sunshine inside of us . Well , maybe we have something else . Something that was in the air . In the dust . Something we touched or breathed in . Power source in the dust . - What ? - Dust in the wind . Shit ! What ? Yeah , I 'll be right down . Fuck ! - Who else has it ? - Agent Hicks . - 4 other ATF agents . - Bob ? Everyone who was on site . We found 1123-4 cyanobacteria but what we don 't know is what the hell 's keeping it alive . There 's no sunshine in your body , David . But there a ray of hope in my head - ' cause I found something . - What ? The fuse to the time bomb , I think . Geobacters . All the sunshine cyanobacteria needs . - What are we talking about ? - Geological bacterium . - It 's around since beginning of time . - These things can live anywhere . Under the Antarctic ice . Top of Mount Everest . Even deep in the dust around a secret Utah lab . Now get this . Recent discoveries suggest that when these little guys eat , they give off a minute electrical charge . And this has been documented ? Derek Lovley , UMass Amherst . Take one , pass them around . So it 's a living fuel cell . All the energy ... that 1123-4 needs to survive inside the human body and work its magic . Energy in a black hole . Geobacter . Here 's what I 'm thinking . These things are everywhere out in the world , right ? Usually they 're way deep down . So somehow , the ones in Utah got stirred up to the surface . Now you 've got your power source , right ? Like a match ready to strike . Somehow someone came in contact with them and unknowingly brought them into the lab . So the lab is contaminated with Geobacter . The scientists would 've never realized they were even carrying them . And then along the way while they were working with 1123-4 ... they somehow came in contact with it as well , accidentally ingested it . See they 're working with a controlled bacteria . They know that it can 't survive without sunlight or an energy source so they relax , they fuck any biohazard worries - and they basically fuck themselves . - So what happened ? 1123-4 and Geobacters are inside of them . 1123-4 can generate hydrogen gas from the water in our bodies . Geobacters provide the energy source . Somehow they ignite . But they need a spark , a Bunsen burner , maybe a cigarette . The lab explodes . 1123-4 escapes in one giant sneeze all over the desert . A nano mistake with global consequences . So how do these Geobacters and cyanobacteria come together ? They have a syntrophic relationship . Can 't live without each other . The Geobacter can 't survive with a lot of oxygen . Cyanobacteria eats oxygen creating an O2-less bubble around them with an increase of hydrogen , right ? Cyanobacteria needs energy to live . Geobacter makes plenty of it . They basically attract each other like flies and shit . I 'm gonna call the ATF , I 'll get them to put up a quarantine around the lab . No-go zone , 10k perimeter and we need to get the soil samples , okay ? If we can 't contain this thing ... Let 's just find out how much trouble we 're in Wes , okay ? Got it . What is it , Bob ? If the Geobacters are inside the dust in Utah , that means that they 're in you and me . Very likely . You wanna take the rest of the day off and dwell on it ? - I 'll prep the soil samples . - Thank you . - What ? ! - Real sensitive , Sandstrom . Fuck Mayko , they 're probably all through my guts too , okay ? Look , it 's really simple , okay ? We just need to break the chain . We kill either one of these bugs and the hydrogen gas production inside us stops ! What about out there ? If we can 't figure out a way to kill this thing then we 're all fucked ! I think we need to get David and Bob to a hospital . It 's a good idea but David won 't go . He 's so stressed out . You know this thing about his dad , right ? - Of course . - Apparently he 's really getting to him . What did he say ? Something about how his father won 't stop pushing his buttons . - David . - What ! Do you want to talk to the money behind Greenway ? Titus Muyerbridge represents Auflander Docheimer industries . That 's the company that underwrites the science at Greenway . Yeah . - Mr. Muyerbridge ? - I 'm here . I have David Sandstrom for you . Hello , Dr. Sandstrom . Thanks for all your help . Who are you guys ? ADI is a diversified global opportunities venture capital fund . We specialize in energy , environment and nanotechnology . Impressive . Why 'd it take so long to find you ? We 're passive investors , not hands-on operators . You get to stand well back when the shit hits the fan , is that it ? - What are you talking about ? - I 'm talking about 6 dead scientists . I 'm talking about 6 ill-equipped , ill-prepared kids . They were extremely talented PHDs in their field . I guess they 've blinded by money at the end of the tunnel because they cut corners and released a doomsday nanobug . I can see you have a flair for the dramatic . Auchtung , you 're not listening . How much money are you throwing at the scientific community ? How many other slipshod labs are you financing out there ? Auflander Docheimer is investing close to a billion dollars in 12 countries . 37 different projects . Look ... We respect our scientists . - We don 't over and micromanage . - Or impose safeguards ? Invest in appropriate containment ? - Insist on peer oversight , review ? - You 're being inflammatory . I 'm being realistic ! You cant just go throwing your money out there without a clue of what you 're doing ! Science isn 't a goddamn light bulb glowing in the dark , anymore . We 're able to play with the fundamental rocks of existence . Rocks that can crumble with the mistake the size of an atom ! We try to look at it much more optimistically . The only difference between you and a jackass is the way atoms are arranged ! It 's a pleasure talking you both . Good luck with your ... investigation . One final word of caution . Everything that was taken from the lab is legally the property of ADI . Fuck you Titus ! You 're wearing a big soggy diaper full of shit and I am gonna pull your pants down on the 6 : 00 news . Watch for it ! Get back to work ! I 'm out here . I figured you 'd be gone by now . Well , you figured wrong . I 'm not leaving until we work this out . You keep me here for a reason , David . - Yeah ? - Yes , you do . You keep me here to remind you of an uncomfortable truth . - Really , Dad ? - Yeah , really . The explosion in your lab . You never really got to the bottom of it . Why ? Because bureaucrats in Washington fucked me over , Dad . Fuck ' em back ! Can we just drop this ? We 've been over it a 100 times . Then why won 't you just say " Goodbye , Dad . Have a nice trip . " Why do you make it so hard for me to leave ? Because . Say , you want to take a little walk , go down to the café ? Watch the pretty girls go by ? Drink a beer ? I 'm tired . Yeah , well , of course you are . It 's been a rough 6 months for you , hasn 't it ? Dealing with all this crap ? Saving my mind with prion injections , the lab exploding , all your friends dying . I 'm just tired , Dad ! - Tell me something I don 't know . - Did you sleep here last night ? I said tell me something I don 't know . I retested the throat swab . And you found the Geobacter . Carlos , something i don 't know . I compared the first sample to a new one . Yesterday the counts were 200 cells per milliliter , today , 340 . Hang on a second . Hang on , hang on . How many hours ago ? 14 . I think that you and Bob should be in a hospital . Fuck that shit . So that 's 12 % per hour . 7 . You need to be somewhere where we can monitor you hourly . I don 't need monitoring . I need to know when we 're gonna pop ! There 're many variables . It depends how much 1123 you were contaminated with , how quickly it 's replicating . I don 't know , okay ! This is why a hospital is the best place for you to go . How much time do we have ? ! I 'm working on a formula , David . But it 's hard , I 'm worried . Then don 't drink water Bob and don 't smoke cigars ! What about static electricity ? What about light switches ? Somebody on the street lighting a cigarette , candles at restaurant . Fine ! If you 're that worried about it , check yourself into a hospital ! The rest of us will figure this out without you ! I analyzed the soil samples in and around the Greenway lab . Please don 't worry , David . I found Geobacters in all the samples and 1123-4 . Right out to the edge of the evacuation zone around the lab . - Bob . About before . - What ? I 'm fine . We still have a chance to contain it though . I was thinking of some kind of foam but it can 't be petroleum or water based . Geobacters thrive in that . Maybe a neutral powder . Okay so 7 % per hour . - Maybe a tarp . Or plastic . - 7 % per hour . That 'd be a lot of plastic . Still need a spark . Here 's what we need to do . We need to inject this in mice - and compare the timeline . - I 've already done that ... Where are the results ? ! For fuck sakes . I 'll go do it again myself ! Come on . Come on . - There you go . - David . Stay away from me , I 'm a fucking time bomb . Tick-tick-tick . Don 't disappear into this , okay . We need you . Tick-tick-tick , Carlos . Let me take you home . You can sleep a little bit ... You want me to take a swing at you ? ! No , you don 't wanna do that . Leave me the fuck alone and let me see how long it takes for this mouse to fry . There you go . That 's it . You okay ? Sorry , I didn 't see you . Got a lot on your mind ? Yeah . How about you , Mayko ? How 're you doing ? He 's such an asshole , Carlos . He 's scared , Mayko . When David 's scared , that 's all he knows how to do . Just be an asshole ? It 's been a long , long journey . Yeah . Really long . Who 's there ? - These are nice . - Don 't thank me . They 're from Carlos . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . How was the funeral ? - I got drunk . - Oh God . Then I hit Wes . And then I got drunker . Well , did you at least put a Cala Lily on her grave for me ? Course I did . - Good . - Does it make you feel better ? She liked Cala Lilies . Well , just so you know I like sunflowers Just so you Know . Careful , Sandstrom , your time 's gonna come and oh boy them gods of fate - are gonna get you good . - Them gods of fate ? Listen , if there are gods of fate and they ever have to contend with me , - they 'll be shaking in their boots . - Shaking with glee . Shaking ... with glee . - What is it ? - Aeromonas virus 31 . And it destroys cyanobacterium ? Look what the virus did to the cyano cell in less than 20 minutes . Gone . And it didn 't harm any other cells ? Well , that 's one problem . And it 's gonna take a while to find that out . - How much time do think ? - How many different cells in the body ? 1,345 at last count , grouped together into 3 different tissue types : epithelial , mesothelial , endothelial . Which are then sub-classed - in thousands types of cells . - Grand total , a million plus . Yop . Take a while . But the bigger problem is : how is the Aeromonas gonna target that particular cyanobacterium in that maze ? - What ? - We don 't have to target 1123-4 . Not the cyanobacterium . The nanodots . What if we ... What if we ... Engineered it into ... If we put it ... Look , the nanodots are iron . So , we have a unique target . What if we ... ? We need to talk to David ! Nanopredator ? Not only a virus that can infect and hold the bacteria but is also designed specifically to target the iron nanodot on its surface . - A magic bullet . - This is good , Bob . It 's good . Nanopredator , this is all really good . What are you thinking ? We somehow find a way to target the metal catalyst - with a nanopredator virus ? - Is it possible ? Why not ? We know the atomic structure of the nanodots . All we need is to find a bacteriophage that would bind with it and it alone . So we create a nanopredator bacterial virus that will seek and destroy only cells with nanodots . Exactly . Okay , that takes care of us . What about Utah and you know , the rest of the planet ? We have to put the nano-predators into the environment , but ... - you could never get rid of them all . - We don 't have a choice . 1123-4 's already in the environment , so if we wanna keep it in check . David , you 're talking about a whole new ecology . Well , yeah , if that 's what it takes . Nanodot vs. nanopredator . We 're gonna change the fucking rules 'cause all the rules were broken . I 'll get right on producing enough of the nanodot to do the experiment . I think I have everything I need . I 'll get plenty of virus available to start the scrape . - That 's all I need . - Bob ? You 're gonna be fine . Thank you . I know . She 's my Mom . Can you page her again , please ? Jeff ! God . What are you doing here ? I gotta talk to you . Are you alright ? No , Mom , I 'm not . It 's okay . Dad says I have to stay at Hamstead , no matter what . Julie Henshaw is still walking around free . Julie did not kill Tyler . Yes , she did . I know it . Half the school knows . - The police know it . - No , not according to the DNA tests . I know you think she 's innocent . I talked to the Rodmans at Tyler 's memorial . They said you cleared her . What the hell is that about ? ! DNA tests don 't lie . She threatened Tyler . I heard her . So did everyone at school . I know . But you know that saying something and doing it are 2 completely different things . Then look at this . - Jeff , I ... - Just look . What 'd you just say to me , you little prick ? What 'd you just say ? - Get that fucking thing outta my face ! - You killed Tyler ! Say it ! Fuck you ! How you 'd like a trip to the hospital ? I 'll get you one day ! - Did you show that to Dean Miller ? - For what ? She 'd get a slap on the wrist . She 's a fucking senator 's daughter , who you 're letting get away with murder . That is not true . All I did was read the data . Maybe you didn 't read it prop . - Hey Bob . - Who 's this ? This is my son Jeff . Hi , Jeff . I have a cousin named Jeff . He 's a banker in Barrie . He has a dog . She 's gonna have puppies . I think I 'm gonna get one . So you 're here to see what your mother does at the shop ? - Sort of . - You headed for science , too ? No , I wanna be a D.J. Oh cool . K-os , Killers , Massive Attack ? Yeah . Rachel . I 'm gonna need those virus batches tonight . - Yes , they 'll be ready . - Sure . David . What the fuck ? How the fuck did you get in here ? The door was open . I 've been calling you . Would you people stop ? How much are you drinking ? I don 't need a fucking wife , alright ? Are you still on anti-depressants ? I don 't need any fucking antidepressants . David . - You 're going to kill yourself . - No , I can 't help it , Carlos . It 's in my genes . - David ... - Look , I 'm fine , okay ! Would you leave me the fuck alone ? I 'm just ... I 'm just tired ! I think you should come back to the lab with me . Why ? I think you will be safe there . Where I can keep an eye on you . The lab doesn 't feel like the safest place in the world these days . David ! She 's dead . David . Let 's get you some sleep . Lie down . - Jeffrey . - Don 't do the " Jeffrey " thing . - Look at this ! - I have seen it . Look at it again ! What 'd you just say to me , you little prick ? What 'd you just say ? - Get that fucking thing outta my face ! - You killed Tyler ! say it ! Fuck you ! How 'd you like a trip to the hospital ? I 'll get you one day . What 'd you just say to me , you little prick ? What 'd you just say ? David . - I have some news . - No more bad news , Bob . I think I figured it out . What ? Tell me . In the mice , Aeromonas virus killed the cyanobacteria . Mayko has a model of it . But I have a problem . What ? We don 't have much time , David . Shit . We 'll work it out , Bob . We 'll work it out . Come on , let 's go see Mayko . - Tell me it 's gonna work . - In theory , it 's gonna work . We modeled it after a T4 bacteriophage going after E. Coli . That 's good . We know that works . I didn 't have any problem synthesizing the nanodots from 1123-4 . So we selected a T4 nanopredator which honed in on the nanodots ... - And in goes the nanopredator . - In theory . - Yes . Kick-ass science . - Thanks . We 're making progress . Progress ? You got it . There are still some bumps to smooth over . It delivered it 's DNA into the cyanobacteria , instructing it to produce masses of nanopredator viruses . - And it multiplied and multiplied . - The process took less than 20 minutes . What 's the problem ? We don 't know what happened to the virus after it killed the bacterium . It did what all viruses do . It waits there or it looks for a new target . Well it should , but we can 't find it and we can 't prove that . We have a toasted mouse that didn 't get the T4 and a happy mouse that did . I don 't see what the problem is . They 're trying to say that we don 't know what else the virus will do in the body . Who gives a fuck ? If I analyze your gut right now , I 'd find a trillion viruses . It 's the most abundant thing on the planet . You 're scared ? It either works or not . Wanna see Bob burst into flames ? - David . - What ? - We 're all into this together . - No , we 're not ! No , you 're not ! Mayko ! You don 't have it ! Bob come with me ! David . What the fuck is going on around here ? Where is it , Bob ? - Where is it ? - Calm down . - The sample you used on the mice ? - David , what are you doing ? - Stop it ! - Is that it ? Yes , but we don 't know ... David ! David ! David ! Hold on , you 're going to be okay . David , do you know where you are ? What time ? It 's 3 o 'clock . I 've been out for 5 hours ? 29 , David . So what happened to the bacterium ? - You 're not dead . - But it worked ? Took way too much . Perforated your stomach lining . How bad ? Not bad enough that the doctors couldn 't fix it . We were able to monitor your hydrogen production , come up with the exact dosage . You neutralize it ? I injected Bob this morning . He 's taken the vaccine to Utah . How is Bob ? He 's overseeing the cleanup . Working with a team of engineers from U of T trying to find a way to put the agent into an aerosol spray . No , I meant ... Well , I must 've freaked him out pretty badly back at the lab . Yes . I explained to Bob how sick you were . Good . Alright then ... - Let 's get outta here . - David . I think ... - I think you should stay . - Why ? You 're not sick because of the cyanobacteria . I had them do a toxicology on you . When you came in , you were legally drunk . They found Sertraline , Citalopram and Escitalopram in your system . Just take me home . - David , I ... - Please . - I don 't think it 's a good idea . - Please . Just take me home . Alright , sit up . Julie Henshaw ? Julie Henshaw ? I 'd recognize you anywhere . Those eyes . Bit different . So ? You wanna tell me why you assaulted my son ? You 're a dangerous person , you know that . - You have anger issues . - Bark my hole , lady . I think you were responsible for Tyler 's death . - Headline , lady : " No , I 'm not ! " - And I did one of the DNA tests . So then you know there was no match , twice . But there 's that all circumstantial evidence . You assaulted my son . Everyone knows you 're homophobic . And you 're clearly an unstable person . I 'm gonna need another sample and I 'm all set up . We can do it right here , right now . Get real . If you don 't give me a blood sample , I 'm going to take this video to the Dean 's Office - and I 'm going to have you expelled . - I 'm so scared . That the way you want to play it ? Fine . Jeffrey don 't . Leave her . You little prick . Running home to mommy ? - You think you can do what you want . - Fuck you ! - She 's going to bounce you outta here . - Bullshit . She 's just a fucking bitch . - She 's my Mom . Watch your mouth . - Why don 't you watch your back ? Fuck you . Asshole . - You okay ? - Yes . Think I have a future in science . I think you do , too . Good work . Thanks for the lift . - Look , I 'm just gonna crash , so ... - Yeah , I 'm staying . We need to talk . - Man , don 't fuckin ' do this . - Sit down , please . David . Sit down . - David , you are a mess . - I know , I know . But ... I 'm gonna ... I 'm gonna get through it . Yeah . It 's been 6 months . Why do you put up with me ? Why don 't you just let me go ? Because it 's time to stop running . You 're right . I know that , I know that . But I can 't . I just ... I just keep thinking , 8 of my people died and - I walked out of there without scratch . - That 's not what this is about . Don 't . Please . I know what you 've been doing , my friend . I just need a little more time , Dad . A lot on my plate these days . The lab 's a total fucking disaster . I got a funeral to go to every time I turn around . You don 't need any more time . I can 't do it right now . Alright ? I gotta do more research . I don 't know what 'll happen . You know what 'll happen if you don 't do it . C 'mon , they 're making discoveries about Alzheimer 's disease - all the time these days . - So are you . We just don 't know enough about prions . There 's some evidence that suggests that yes , - they could be used to improve memory . - So . Improve mine . There 's other evidence that suggests they could destroy your brain . Roll the dice , David . I 'm just an old man . - You 're my father . - What have I got to lose ? No more booze . No more pills . David , it 's been 6 months . You have to face this . - I can 't . - You have to . Dad ? I was going over Mayko 's prion studies . Dad , I want you to come to work with me today . Take some blood . Do some tests . Come on , Dad . Rise and shine . Dad ! David , listen to me , listen to me . You did not kill your father . He killed himself . Help me . I 'll get you all the help you need , my friend . I told dad I don 't want to board here any more and he freaked out . He 's under a lot of stress these days , sweetheart . Don 't take it personally . I finished those tests . I 'd like to go over the results with you . Just a minute . - Hey , Bob . Right there . - Thanks . Did you see that Auflander report on Greenway ? - That was insulting . - Total white wash . Greenway was a rogue lab . We gave no funding approval for research in transgenic process of cyanobacteria . - How do you think David 's gonna feel ? - You 're gonna tell him ? I think that 's Weston 's job . - I 'm back . Shoot . - Okay ... I 'm downloading some stuff onto your screen . - Got it ? - Yeah . Got it . Alright . That 's the DNA profile of the spit police retrieved from Tyler 's jacket . Okay . Now I 'm gonna overlay the DNA from Julie Henshaw 's blood sample . See that ? They don 't line up . But , but she did it ! Now here comes the DNA from the spit you collected . - Yeah . - I 'm gonna line ' em up spit-to-spit . And look at that . - A perfect match . - She did it . She killed Tyler . Yeah . Yeah , she did . Not much to celebrate is there . He 's gone and ... Her life 's down the drain now , too . I still don 't get it . Spit matche , blood doesn 't . Why ? She doesn 't have a sister , does she ? She 's an only child . Then she 's a chimera . - A what ? - Chimera . It 's 2 fertilized eggs fused together in the uterus . Only there isn 't fraternel twin , it 's 2 distinct sets of DNA come together in one person . It 's rare , but it does happen . How can you have 2 sets of DNA in one person ? You 'd be a freak . Not so much of a freak . Really . Her blood , brain , liver are developed by one set of DNA while her saliva , lungs and ovaries another . How 'd you figure that out ? What 'did you just say to me you little prick ? What 'd you just say ? It was those eyes . Those different coloured eyes . I don 't know if I can do this , man . They 're gonna make me get in a circle and hold hands with total strangers . Whatever it takes . The fucking cure sounds worse than the disease . David , sometimes you have to listen to other people . Sometimes other people know more about you than you do about yourself . Well , I hate that . You wanna spend the rest of your life in freefall ? No . I just , I love single malt , you know . And I love good weed . I love bad weed . Go in there and let them tell you what to do . Okay ? One step at a time . God , you think you 'd know if you 'd gone too far ? David , you 're going to be alright . You think you 'd know . Okay . Here I go . Look , - promise me one thing . - Anything . I come out there , I become total boring prick , you 'll tell me ? it 's too late for that . - Good luck . - Thanks . We have 4 hospitals saying it 's West Nile and 3 saying it isn 't . These people don 't know each other , the transmission has to be food , place . That narrows it down to a couple thousand types of virus or bacteria . They lost another patient . She didn 't even last an hour . - Herb Kinsman got the axe . - So who 's in charge ? Man named Carl Riddlemayer . So what 's the game here , Carl ? It 's all about sharpening the tip of the spear , Dave . - I 'm just do this thing with Angie . - Who ? Angelica Starov . I 'd like to talk to you about Owen . She fixes addicts by messing with the biology in their brains . Owen , the science is way off . My first challenge is to cut 3.8 billion dollars out of science budget . - What the hell is going on here ? - Excuse me ? Science is on the verge of unlocking the secrets of life ! And you 're thinking about amputating the only organization that 's actually minding the store ! You 're insane ! All of you !

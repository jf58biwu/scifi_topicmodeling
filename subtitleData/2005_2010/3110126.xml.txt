 My name is Detective Brett Hopper . And this is the day that changes everything . You 're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza . I will be framed for murder . Who the hell are you , people ? My girlfriend Rita will be in danger . I know all this because I am living the same day ... over , and over again . The day is the same , but different things happen . The pieces are finally coming together . They wanted me to set up a meeting . - What 's it about ? - Corruption at city hall . Why Garza was murdered . He cut a deal . He was supposed to testify againt Booth . Why I was framed . Garza sent me two packages . Evidence from one of my father 's old cases . Everyone around me is somehow tied to this . Shelten ... It 's been a while . You 're asking me to lie . You 've had four years of practice . What the hell are you doing here , D. ? I need five minutes . But until yesterday , I was missing a couple of key players . They arraigned some lawyer . His name is Barry Coldburn . Booth , Detweiler . Spivak ? Now , it 's time to finish it . Great minds , uh ? I love you . I love you too . There 's something I need to tell you . It 's about my brother Billy . Billy was sure we 'd go to jail for what we did to Dad . Freaked out . I did the only thing that I could think of . I called Chad . I can 't let this hang over me anymore . I think I should go to the police and tell them what I did . No , not today . It 's too dangerous . Call your brother , tell him to get out of town . These people are serious . What are you saying ? These are the same people that are ... framing you for Garza 's murder ? I think it all revolves around a case this judge is building . The grand jury 's supposed to convene tomorrow . And Garza was supposed to testify . I think that 's why ... he was killed . But what does that have to do with us ? I don 't know . But ... If we 're gonna get through this , we 're gonna need some help . - Thanks for coming . - Not a problem . Pleasant surprise . Everything alright ? Cream , two sugars , right ? Real nice of you using Rita to embush me . She told me everything . About Billy . Her father . How you helped them out with the body . I 'm sorry , Chad . I ... I just ... I couldn 't lie to him anymore . I would have done the same thing . Please ... Just hear him out . - What do you want from me , Hopper ? - Those guys you dealt with back then . The same guys are messing with me now . Something really big is about to happen . And it deals with politicians ... gangs ... crooked cops ... Today 's the day I 'm gonna bring it all down . I 'm asking , are you in ? I 'm listening . There 's a case going before the grand jury tomorrow , investigating corruption in city hall . But there 's a Robbery / Homicide Detective named Spivak . You know him ? A real pain in the ass . What about him ? Subpoenas are being issued in this case . His name is on the list . Wanna be part of this ? Look into Spivak . What makes you think I 'll help you of all people ? The sniper was gonna shoot you , but I pushed you out of the way . - Why did you do it ? - We were friends once . Partners . I know we got our issues , but ... at the end of the day , I think you 're a good cop . A good man . I think we should tell him about Garza . The A.D.A. that got killed last night ? Brett 's being framed for his murder . OK , I 'm on my way . I 'd love to explain , but I gotta go . You can 't just say you 're wanted for killing a public official and expect to walk away . I forgot to make this phone call . - No , I can 't let you go . - Get out of my way . You talked a good game about corruption and dirty cops , but you failed to mention that you 're wanted for murder . - You don 't understand . - I have to do this . Let 's go down to the station . Easy . If you 're innocent , you got nothing to worry about . Margo , wait . Don 't move . Give it up , pal . - No place left to run . - Right . - Freeze ! - Margo , don 't get in the car . OK , give me twenty minutes . Stop the bus ! I 'm a police officer . Yeah ! But what the hell , are you crazy ? Get out of the bus , you 'll have a stroke . Pal , I don 't know what the hell you are thinking . This bus is about to crash , he 's gonna have a stroke any second . - What did you say ? - This is insane ! - I gotta hit you outta here . - Please , just calm down . Rita , call 911 , now ! - Easy . - We got him . I think he 's having a stroke ! Hold on , sir . You gotta stand up . What are you doing ? Do some digging , you 'll find Spivak 's the inside man . Promise me you 'll go to the hospital and stay there . I need to know you 're safe . - I can 't . - Promise me . Don 't leave until I say . - All right ? - I promise . Alright . May I help you ? Yes , Detective Brett Hopper . LAPD . I 'm looking for Margo Clarke . She stepped away . Are you Judge Nitzberg ? Yes , why ? I 'm here about the grand jury hearing tomorrow . Damien Ortiz , he 's my confidential informant . And I know that he was testifying for you . So was Garza . Who sent you , Booth ? No , sir . We 're on the same side . Booth framed me for Garza 's murder . You can tell Booth and his cronies I will not be intimidated . This grand jury investigation will proceed with or without Garza . That 's good . See , that 's why I 'm here . Sir , Garza sent me two packages . Evidence linked to a homicide that my father worked . Evidence that leads right back to Booth . - Garza sent you evidence ? - Yes , sir . In case something would happen to him , I guess I was his ... insurance policy . And somebody found out . Now , did anybody else know that he was gonna testify ... Detective . I can 't risk discussing the details . Your Honor , I just need to know if I 'm on the right track . Who else knew ? Technically ... No one . The warrant was sealed , but ... But what ? Last night , he called and said he was having second thoughts . - Garza called you last night ? - He was scared , he said that his wife kept telling him how dangerous these people are . So Mrs. Garza was trying to talk him out of testifying . - She 's in on this . With Booth . - What ? She claimed that she saw me murder her husband . She 's the key witness against me . Julissa ? - Why ? - I don 't know but if ... if Garza told her about the packages , and she told Booth ... She 's the connection . She betrayed her husband . That 's how Booth found out about me . That 's why I 'm being framed . Now , this grand jury ... Do you have enough to bring down Booth without Garza ? I don 't know . We 've had to postpone the hearing . But the other presiding judges and I are going to need to see if we can continue . - When 's the meeting ? - It hasn 't been set yet . Let 's say I can break Mrs. Garza . Is she just as valuable to you as her husband ? - You think you can do that ? - Yes . But I need a favor from you . I surrender . - Jenny . - Brett . Everything 's gonna be OK . - Can you give us a sec ? - Yeah . Make it fast . Everything is in here , just like you wanted . All this ... - Is it about Dad ? Why- - - Yes . I know it 's been eating you up inside for a long time . Why he killed himself . But you need to realize you 're not Dad . Hopper , we gotta move . Thanks , sister . Look , I 'm only doing this because Judge Nitzberg called - and vouched for you . - You 're doing the right thing . I 'd better be . You screw this up and I 'm running a desk for the next ten years . - Where is she ? - Inside , with your partner . - You 've got ten minutes . - Alright . - I 'll wait for you . - Alright . Oh God . It 's him . That 's the man that killed my husband ! Be quiet . Save your breath . I know you 're in on it . Framing me for your husband 's murder . Why is he here ? This man is a killer . He 's innocent till proven guilty . Why did you do it ? Did Booth have something on you ? This is ridiculous . They found a gun in his apartment . She 's got a point . Give me a favor , go down to SID , grab hold of ballistics and prints for the murder weapon . Someone 's gonna fake the results . - You sure about all this ? - I 'm sure . Now we 're gonna start at the very beginning . Don 't ... touch the bubble head . The detective who just left ... Spivak . What was he doing down here ? It 's a simple question . Was the gun in my right hand or in my left ? - I 'm not ... - Right or left ? You said I was standing over your husband 's body with the gun . - Which hand was it in ? - I demand to see a lawyer . Did I leave out the back or the front ? - I don 't know . - You don 't know because I wasn 't there ! Did you even know what your husband had on Booth ? I do . He sent it to me . I don 't know what you 're talking about . That 's Isabella Contreras . Booth had her killed . Killed . One to the head , two to the chest . Sound familiar ? That 's his M.O. What the hell is this ? Booth didn 't tell you about Isabella , did he ? I 've known Tobias for 25 years . He 's an honorable man . How dare you ? You let a murder suspect into a room with our only eye witness ? I got a call from a presiding judge who vouched for Hopper . - What judge ? - Nitzberg . See , the sad thing about this is that when a woman 's pregnant , they do a separate autopsy ... on the fetus . See , that 's the man that you 're trying to protect . - It 's not possible . - He got a girl pregnant , and then killed her to save his own career . Tobias would never ... Tobias ... I had it all wrong . Here I thought he was blackmailing you ... That 's not what happened . You were sleeping with him . You realize what you 've done ? Mrs. Garza 's testimony is tainted , we 'll be lucky if anything she says is admissible in court . Your husband would tell you everything . But he didn 't know that you were rolling over and whispering those same secrets into Booth 's ear . - You have no right . - You basically let the killer in , let the killer put a bullet in your husband 's head . - I don 't have to hear this from you . - Garza flipped on Booth , finally listened to his conscience , finally found the strength to say no . Alberto was weak ! He got what he deserved ! You have no idea ... what I sacrificed ... Did she just say what I think she did ? I put in too much time , too many years to let it all die . Because Alberto lacked the strength to do whatever it takes . He was nothing without me . Hopper didn 't do it . - Are you happy now ? - We gotta get Booth down here , now . Yeah , we do , make the call . I ... just received the word . I know . What do you want me to do ? Cooperate fully . Let them do their song and dance . I 'll get you out of there in an hour . I mean about Julissa Garza , she knows enough to implicate me . I 'll handle Julissa . But we have a more pressing problem . Detective Hopper . - I 'll talk to Detweiler . - Talk to everyone . Detweiler , Nick Vukovic , Torrez and all his people . I understand . Hopper will be dead before the day is over . The important thing ... is that nothing derails tomorrow . We have to send a clear message as to who exactly runs this city . I understand completely . Yeah . I 'll be sure to pass that along . No . Thank you , sir . Damn shame . Someone you know betrays you . Makes you wonder who you gotta really trust . * gotta / can ? What are you talking about ? I just got word : Hopper 's the one who gave you up at the safe house . Hop ? You sure ? I wish I wasn 't . Kills me to be the one who tell you , kid . Thanks . Good news and bad news . Found the body in the bathtub over your apartment , so that checks out . But there was no one at that address on Via Ombra . What ? They must have moved Margo somewhere else . They said she had to set up a meeting for tomorrow . A group of judges . If this is as big as you 're claiming , it could lead to dozens of arrests . Prison officials , city councilmen , federal prosecutors , ex-cops . Not just ex-cops . Active duty too . What do you got ? I can 't prove anything yet . I 'm gonna see if we got anything on this ... Konrad Detweiler . Cool . That 's a hell of a story , Hopper . Everybody out to get at you . You are to get me too ? Me ? No , I 'm just doing my job ! Does that include planting a weapon at my place doctoring ballistics and faking finger prints ? Nobody 's here , it 's just you and me . Admit it . The apple doesn 't fall far from the tree , you 're just like your old man . - The ego , the sheer eye dance ... - Watch your mouth ! My father was a good cop . He was a dirty cop . And he dragged down a lot of good people with him . Who do you think you 're playing , Spivak , you 're not sleek . I know about the grand jury . The subpoena . My father did what he had to do to protect his family . What 's your excuse ? You don 't know a damn thing , Hopper . Nick Vukovic is my ex-partner . - Nick ? - That 's right . And your dad turned him into the traitor he is today . - Get the facts straight . It 's the- - - That 's a lot of crap , Hopper ! Talked to my guys in county . You wanna see this . Jackets on Fencik and Buchalter . Ex-deputies , just like Hopper said . You 're gonna move on that , or what ? Got a present for you too . SID found your finger prints on the Garza murder weapon , - just like you said . - Who else has seen this report ? No one . It was on top of Rednazki 's inbox , still sealed . You stole it ? Borrowed it . Either way , it shouldn 't have been there . Any idea who gave it to us ? I have a pretty good guess . What 's up with the widow ? Mrs. G. ? She lawyered up already , she 's on her way home . Who 's the suitor ? The best defense guy in the city . - Barry Coldburn . - Yeah , how do you know ? That just makes sense . - Catch up with me later . - All right . - Hello ? - Detective Hopper , this is Judge Nitzberg . Your Honor , is everything OK ? Well , I 'm not sure . Margo never came back from lunch , but she left me a voice mail . You never saw her after I left ? No , but she called to set a meeting for me with the other presiding judges . - Is this about the grand jury ? - Yes . They grabbed me at work . Two of them . They wanted me to set up a meeting . At the courthouse . - When 's the meeting ? - Nine o 'clock . - Nine o 'clock tonight ? - No , tomorrow morning . Tomorrow . It 's a long way away . I gotta go . I 'll take him up , fellows . Sorry , elevator 's full . Lose the entourage . I 'm sorry , have we met ? I don 't know what you got planned , but it 's over . Yeah , we broke Mrs. Garza . You 're that detective . Right ? You forgot to tell her about Isabella Contreras . How you killed the young woman . And her unborn child . Your unborn child . You think this is the first time I 've been threatened by a detective named Hopper ? Your father made threats too , and look how that ended . You don 't talk about him . Suit yourself . But you two have a lot more in common than you might think . I have bad news for you , Detective . I 'll be out of here in an hour and you 'll end up with a bullet in your head , just like your old man . And just like him , you 'll never see it coming . Didn 't you hear me from the lobby ? What 's wrong ? I need you to tell me everything that you remember about Dad 's death . - Why ? - I know it 's hard , it 's just ... It 's really important . Tell me exactly what you saw when you found him . It was a mess . I walked in , and ... I saw his body . I tried calling Mom , tried calling you . And then I got hold of Nick . What did he say ? He was shocked . But he came right away . He called the police . He handled everything . He really saved me , that day . Maybe you should talk to him . Why are you asking me about this now ? I don 't think dad killed himself . I think he was murdered . What ? - Who ? - Wait , let me call Nick . Nick , it 's Hopper . Where are you ? - Yeah ? - Hi , Hopper . What do you want ? Just heard the good news , word is you 've been cleared of the Garza mess . Yeah , thanks . Listen man , I got to meet somebody , so ... Gotta hand it to you , I thought they had you cold . Well , with your prints all over the murder weapon ... . - Wait , what did you just say ? - Nothing . Just trying to figure how the killer got your prints on the gun that hit Garza . Wait . How did ... Heard you 've been doing a lot of talking , Hop . - Tell me about it . - Where is Nick ? I 'm gonna need some answers first . Do you believe in déjà vu ? Can 't leave today ... Over and over ... I 'm reminded of another time , another place , and a different Detective Hopper . Dad shot himself . Where did you drag my father into ? He came to me ! You 'll end up with a bullet in your head , just like your old man . And just like him , you 'll never see it coming . Brett . Oh my God ! We 've been trying to reach you . Yeah , baby , I 'm sorry , I 'm ... I 'm OK . I was so worried . I thought after everything that happened ... No , I 'm all right . You just hold tight . This morning , when you weren 't here , I called the station . Wait , hold on , What d 'you ... What did you just say ? I said I called the station . No , before that . Before that . Did you say this morning ? Yeah . Brett , what 's going on ? You sound really strange . - Rita , what time is it ? - What ? I don 't know . What time is it ? Ten after seven . It 's tomorrow . I don 't understand it , how ... it happened . I don 't know ... What do you mean ? What happened ? No . All this stuff ... All this stuff happened yesterday , but it 's like it 's finally ... The city 's about to go up in flames , Hop . You have no idea how big this is , do you ? They grabbed me at work . They wanted me to set up a meeting . - When 's the meeting ? - Tomorrow morning . Tomorrow ... It 's a long way away . It 's like yesterday 's thing was a set-up . Yesterday was a set up until ... Baby , I get out of here , all right ? Wait . Where are you ? Chad 's been asking for you . - When ? - This morning . He 's on his way over right now . I trust no one , so are you . No , but we have a problem . Hopper knows about Rita 's Dad . - And how did that happen ? - Does it matter ? I 've given you what you wanted . You need to take care of them . She won 't say anything , it 's Hopper we ... You need to take care of them . Not going there . Yes . Yes , we are . A reckoning has come today , Sergeant . Our slates are being wiped clean . I 'll kill you right now . She 'd still die . I 'm afraid you have a decision to make . Hi . You reached the offices of Alan Nitzberg . Neither his Honou nor his assistant , Margo ... My fellow Justices of the Court , our legal system is under attack , today . The death of Alberto Garza was just a warning shot . It was a sign that said : " No one is safe . " It was a sign that said : " We run the System , " we will intimidate you , we will disgrace you , " we will find your darkest secrets . " These men , led by councilman Tobias Booth , try to tell me how the System is running , that I 'd better get on board . I told the councilman his version of justice isn 't mine . Isn 't ours . This isn 't about justice . It 's about a corrupt few controling the many . This is about power . My friends , this is where we draw the line , and make our last stand . We 're in position . Now . It 's all yours . Make it ugly . You OK ? Yeah . I 'm fine . Look , Rita . This is gonna sound crazy , but you 're in danger . We need to leave . We need to get out of town right now . What ? Those people that helped us out with your dad , they 're gonna come after us . They made unacceptable demands . How do you know that ? Because they told me . I tried to talk them out of it . I did something for them . Look , I 'm just trying to take care of you , here . Don 't stop on my account . No , for real . I can 't wait to hear the rest . So , it wasn 't Spivak . It was you . You switched the ballistics and the prints . What are you talking about ? Andrea got to the results before anybody else saw them at SID . So the only person that would have known that those were my prints on the gun ... was the person who planted the report . Is that true , Chad ? I understand what you did with Rita 's father , so they threatened you with that . But something tells me that 's not why you set me up . - Brett , don 't ... - Rita , please . I think you did it ' cause you wanted to . I think you set me up because Rita is with me and not with you . You never deserved her . You still don 't . I don 't know what you see in this back stabbing son of a bitch . He stole you away from me . Chad ... He didn 't steel me . You lost me . Don 't say that . Did you hear what she said ? You lost her . It 's on you , Chad . And always has been . Oh , my God ! Stop it ! It 's over . Barry Coldburn . Sorry , have we met ? Brett Hopper . I think you heard of me . You were that cop . The one who was accused of killing Garza . What can I do for you ? I know what you did . You 're not gonna get away with it . Putting a hand on the judges , killing Garza , framing me ... Those are some pretty outlandish charges , detective . Do you have even a shred of evidence to support them ? Not yet . But it 's no coincidence your name keeps popping up . The Santyana Club , your connection to Booth ... Mrs. Garza ... You even defended my girlfriend four years ago . Really ? - How did I do ? - You made it go away , just like you make all your problems go away ... until this time . Something went wrong . Judge Nitzberg . Hypothetical situation : Let 's say you 're the top cop in the department . Under your regime , crime is down , streets are safer , and bad guys get put away . How hard would you fight to keep it that way ? If it were you , Hopper , if this was your city , would you let other men , lesser men , dictate how justice 's supposed to be carried out ? Would you let them take apart a system that 's been in place for decades ? A system that works ? That you built ? Would you let one man ruin all that ? You brought this whole thing down because one judge said no to you ? Please ... You don 't care about Nitzberg or Garza or any of this . Why don 't you ask me the question you came to ask ? What question is that ? You wanna know what happened to you father . I know what happened to my father . He was murdered . But who did it ? My professional opinion as a defense attorney : homicides are mostly committed by those closest to the victim . A spouse , a sibling ... A partner ... That person often feels soon guilt . Gets close to the family , helps them out in their time of need . Do you know anyone who fits that description , detective ? It 's one hell of a city . I think you 'll find that the system works ... just as it is . The fact that your name was cleared proves my point . And now , if you 'll forgive me , my family is waiting for me . Coldburn ! This isn 't over . Today , it is . Hop . D. Gotta say I judged you wrong , last night . I got some bad intel . I heard you sold me out . Something didn 't feel right . So I had a little chat with Baxter . Turns out , you and me , we both got played . I could have told you that . I know that , now . I could have ended you , Hop . But I didn 't . I wanna believe in the family , now . So I want a clean slate . Make piece . I brought you something . Get out . I don 't know what 's going on . See , this chota , he tried to sell me out to Booth , then turn us against each other . So I say he 's lost his right to breathe . - What do you think ? - Don 't listen to him , Brett ! - You know me ! - I know you killed him , Nick . - What ? Are you crazy ? - Why did you do it ? Please , Brett , it 's not what you think . Why did you do it ? It was the Contreras case . He was gonna bring it all down ! You put the gun in his mouth . He had no idea what those people are capable of ! They would have killed your mom ! - Your sister ! - You pulled the trigger . - I did it for you . - No you didn 't ! You did it for you . I had no choice ! There 's always a choice . Where are you going ? Brett ! Don 't leave ! Think of you fa ... I do . Every day . Hey , buddy ! Rambis ! Take this . What made you wanna finally stay at your place ? I thought we could use a change . You need new pillows . - Well ... - Seriously . Really . Really ?

This macpherson situation- - I realize that they prefer a hands-off approach but- you 're talking . We don 't talk . - oh . Well , i didn 't think that was a rule . I just thought you weren 't particularly social . I see i was right about that . Oh , god . Hi . - she would like a word . - i 'm sure she would . [ alarm buzzing ] [ beeping rapidly ] - let 's just follow the zip line . She 's bound to turn up . - i just hope she 's okay , you know ? - claudia 's like bamboo . You can bend her all you want , but she 'll never break . - this is hers . - how do you know ? - we have to get rid of artie 's bedazzler . - hello . - mm .

I highly recommend it . made it myself . - uh , steak , bloody , black coffee , Two pieces of the pie . - two ? um ... just a house salad . Leena 's got me on a diet . Uh , maybe just one piece of that pie , please . She made it herself . - how are things at the warehouse ? - they 're good . they 're fine . A little chaotic , but it 's a good kind of chaos . - and the missions ? - no one 's been killed . You can 't ask for more than that . And we have an excellent retrieval rate . - what about the incidents in paris Or las vegas or colorado ? - mrs. frederic , you know all about those . Why are you asking me about them ? - i 'm forgetful . refresh my memory . You were saying about paris ? - claudia , there 's half a doughnut in the office . How far do you think she could 've gotten Before the zip line snapped ? - could be the other end of the warehouse . - [ chuckles ] there 's an end ? - i hope so . [ electricity crackles ] - duck and cover . - okay , that was bigger than usual . - to hell with this . I 'm gonna see if i can spot her from up here . - well , be careful . - whoa . - what is it ? - go down the aisle , cross two over , and turn right . - it 's leena 's .

Door . - thank god you 're- - we were following the zip line , And the--and the- yeah , no , i 'm good . I mean , we 're all trapped in here for eternity , But , uh , otherwise i 'm solid . - okay ... Well , let 's just get back to the office , So we can fix the- - What ? - what ? - w-w-what the hell ? This is what I 've been saying . - first the goo doesn 't work . - mm-hmm . - then one of those static balls tries to cook us . - mm-hmm . - and now a clingy house . The warehouse is in a bad mood today . - um , fyi , if anyone has to use the bathroom , Don 't flush . - ooh . - trust me . - okay , you know what ? Just--we just have to wait and--and think about this For a second . - new plan . - ooh , scoring that an 8.5 . Next time you got to- - umph--stick the landing . - let 's all just ... Stop and think about this a second . - that 's a good plan . - claudia , did you try climbing back out Of the same hole that you fell in ? - yeah . Came right back in through the fireplace . I don 't recommend it . - and you trust pete and myka ? - with my life . They 're consummate professionals . Mrs. frederic , i have to ask you , Why , specific- - excuse me . We 're having a private- - do you mind ? - oh , no . that 's all right . - what is he- - - very sorry . private party . - wait , what is- - what is going on ? - i thought they would never leave . Okay , here we go . you be careful , now . This is a hot plate . I think we can begin . Mr. valda . - hello , irene . - mr. valda , nice to see you again . This is agent nielsen . - just--just--just- - just a minute . [ scoffs ] what is this ? - that 's a house salad . Bering and lattimer are consummate professionals . - thank you , theadora . So as you stated in the past , Agents bering and lattimer 's mission- do you mind telling me exactly what is happening here ? - arthur , mr. valda 's asking the questions . Please don 't interrupt him . - yeah , well , i don 't think i 'm gonna be answering Any questions Until you tell me what this is about . - sometimes he forgets we answer to a higher authority . - what higher authori ... Ty ? The regents . these are the regents ? The regents meethere ? - they do today . - you really expect me to believe that- what exactly were you expecting , agent nielsen ? Hooded , cloaked figures standing in half-light Around a perpetually burning flame ? - he 's seen too many movies . - i- - You know , i just would have thought that- - This waitress is a regent ? - john adams was a farmer . Abraham lincoln was a small-town lawyer . Plato , socrates were teachers . Jesus was a carpenter . To equate judgment And wisdom with occupation Is at best ... Insulting . - yeah , that 's not- - w-what i meant- i know what you meant . Who would you have control the warehouse ? Kings ? popes ? politicians ? [ scoffs ] there 'd be nothing left of it . - no , i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . It 's just , i didn 't think- - - yes . That 's one of the reasons we needed to speak with you . Your reluctance to think . - irene ... - mrs. frederic . - thank you , theadora . So as i was saying , you stated in the past That agents bering and lattimer 's mission Was to snag it , bag it , and tag it . Correct ? - yeah , well , you know , i mean , i-i said that . I didn 't mean to denigrate the job description . - yet , in their brief tenure as field agents , They managed to destroy james braid 's chair- if you just let me explain- lewis carroll 's mirror . - that wasn 't destroyed . - your agents released a malevolent entity Into the warehouse , Allowing it access to dangerous artifacts . - an accident . it was a total accident . It is not uncommon for artifacts to be occasionally destroyed For the greater good . And agents lattimer and bering , i mean , They 've repeatedly shown bravery . They 've shown quick thinking . they 're an excellent team . They 're probably the best agents That the warehouse has ever had . - arthur ! Their abilities are not in question here . - oh . This is about me ? - not only you . - your former partner . - macpherson ? - okay , okay , so this version of the bb Is in the warehouse because ... - it 's an artifact . - oh , can this whole place be an artifact ? Like , is that even possible ? - yeah , pretty much anything is possible . - so--so maybe there was an artifact in the original That they couldn 't take out , right ? So--so they just moved the whole thing . - and rebuilt the new one without it . - look for anything here that 's different from our bb . - all right ! that was kind of cool . We had this little , like , group-think thing going on . Gold stars all around . - oh , hey , hey , hey , hey ! I do not recognize that chair . - you were sleeping in it last week . What about this ugly lamp ? - those lightbulbs burnt out a month ago , But this--this is new ... Or old . - [ grunts ] it 's fused to the wall. this is it . - huh . It 's a painting of this room . And we can 't leave this room . Seems like quite the coinky-dink , don 't you think ? - yeah , how very salvador dali . Do you think this painting 's keeping us here ? - maybe . pete , look at the lamp . - what ? - okay , now look at the painting . Claudia put it back in a different spot . It changed Because of what you did . - okay , okay , so maybe If i do something to the picture ... That happens . - sick ! - oh ... After you . Okay . your turn . - don 't mind if i do . - don 't even bother . - [ groans ] - at least that was new . - oh , man. you know what ? this thing is useless ! Did i do that ? - well , neither of us did . [ tearing ] - i can see the warehouse . - okay , um , there 's- - there 's , uh , a letter opener , If i remember ... Yes ! um , okay . - okay . Let 's go . Oh . All right , safe and sound . What ? - that . - maybe we should have stayed inside . - we need to get back to the office . - oh , no need . " what are you doing wasting time installing backup terminals In the aisle , foolish red-haired girl ? " 'cause you never know when you might need one , artie . - nice . - hey-o . Okay , looks like the problem is in the gooery . - what 's a gooery ? - i 'm guessing it 's claudia-speak For the neutralizer processing center . - uh-huh . - right. of course . - well , it 's chapter 197 in the manual . - it 's 1,000 pages long . i 'll wait for the movie . - okay , the neutralizer processing center Is what pumps the purple goo Through the warehouse , creating a stability field . - yeah , it 's like all the gak in here Are nuclear rods , right ? As long as there 's coolant , it 's all good . The gooery jakes out the coolant . - it keeps the artifacts From getting all artifacty on their own . - okay , so the gooery- - cool name , by the way- - Uh , needs to go back online . - man with a plan . [ electricity booms ] - okay , so does chapter 198 say what happens If we don 't get it working again ? - the same thing that happens to the nuclear rods Without the coolant , except probably worse . - yeah , i 'm guessing when we get to 100 % , We have china syndrome . We 've got maybe- - maybe half an hour left . - what 's the fastest way there ? - let me see . We got to go through aisle haddonfield-79 , Then loop around carlsbad-22 . - no , no , no , no , why--why don 't we just go Straight through here ? - ' cause that 's the dark vault . - ooh . [ chuckles ] okay . See , i know what that is . didn 't read the manual . That 's where all the dangerous stuff is . - yeah , like , mega-dangerous , dude. mondo . - okay , okay , but we still- - we can 't loop around . I say we take the risk . - i agree . - it 's not often that i agree , but i agree . - guys , if we 're gonna do this thing , Let 's do this thing . - wait , oh , no , no , no , no . You 're not going anywhere , claud. you 're gonna stay put . - i 'm coming with . - no , no. we 're the agents . We 're the ones that agreed to risk our lives , not you . - yeah , but this is my home too . you might need my help . - she 's right . shehasread the manual . - am i never gonna hear the end of that ? - she knows this place , okay ? I say that she comes with . - please ? - okay , fine , but you stick close . And you doexactlyas we say . - all right . Suicide mission with the team . Kind of exciting . i 'm excited. come on ! - and in attempting to save joshua donovan , You placed his sister- - yet another civilian--in danger . - i 'm sorry . excuse me , please . If this is about macpherson , then why am i being asked About cases that have absolutely nothing to do with macpherson ? - agent nielsen , i will ask the questions . - it might be wise to let this run its course for now . - all right , fine . fine . Ye--yes. yes . In saving joshua , i maybe put claudia in da- - Alittledanger . But i promised her that if- - - you promised ? You promised ? Sounds as if personal feelings Became involved in professional judgment . This has been an issue in the past , has it not ? - it may have come up . But his artifact-retrieval rate is excellent . It 's the highest in years . - thank you . - simply the facts . - very well , then . The facts . Thank you , theadora . Did you or did you not on two separate occasions Involve daniel dickinson , A high-ranking secret service officer , In warehouse 13 matters , All of which were classified at the highest level ? - yes . - we have a unique relationship With the united states government- - A relationship that your actions have now complicated . - i contacted a fellow government official In the normal course of performing my job , A job to which i have dedicated the last 40 years of my life . - no one 's questioning your dedication , arthur . - what we are questioning , agent nielsen , Is your future . [ electricity crashes ] - oh , it 's sealed with an omega level security code . - can you hack it ? - pope , catholic. bear , woods . you know the drill . And ... Done . [ beeps ] [ alarm sounding ] Man , this place is creep-tastic . - okay , don 't--don 't look . don 't touch . Just keep moving . - these objects are so dangerous They can only be controlled by purple containment fields . [ distant laughter ] [ accordion music ] - why are the neutralizer systems Still working in here ? [ ringing ] - backup generators , 'cause everything 's so dangerous . Don 't worry , they should hold up long enough For us to ... [ system powers down ] Realize my karma sucks . - we 're starting to lose them . just--just keep moving . - oh , this is gonna take me a minute . - is it a different code ? - yeah , i got to use an ftl-ascii binary algorithm . - hey , little guy . what you in for ? - almost there . hang in there , guys . [ baby crying ] [ keys clacking ] - and ... We 're good . [ beeps ] - okay , let 's go . Pete ? pete ? Pete ? Pete , what are you- - Whoa , whoa , whoa ! - wait , wait , wait , wait ! - pete ! - crap ! - pete ! - pete , what are you doing ? - pete , can you hear me ? Pete , are you okay ? Pete ! Pete , are you okay ? - attention , warehouse agents . - mrs. frederic . thank god . - emergency evacuation required . Repeat , emergency evacuation required . - mrs. f , we 're down here . - energy levels approaching critical mass . - that 's a recording . - ohh ... - yeah . - emergency evacuation required . - that 's the most i 've ever heard her say . - i know . - well , this is a whole nother code level . It 's gonna take me a few minutes . - you know what ? step aside . Just stand over there . - emergency evacuation required . - whoa ! Okay , that was flat-out awesome . Pete , what are you doing , man ? we got to go . - wait ! wait ! stop , stop , stop ! The circle- - I think it 's there for a reason . Right ?

It 's , um , sylvia plath 's . she wrote this poem called ennui , And ultimately she took her own life in a- myka , i spent some serious time in the bell jar . I know who sylvia plath is . - right . - what 's that thing doing to him ? - [ sighs ] - it 's sucking the life out of him . We have to get him out of the containment field . Pete ? Pete , can you come here ? - why ? What 's the point ? - what do we do ? - there 's no time . Okay , you go up to the gooery , get it online .

I have a wound right here- - Right here in my shoulder that should prove it . He 's out there . oh , he 's out there . And he 's planning something far worse Than any of you can imagine . What are you doing about it ? What are you doing ? you 're tying my hands ! - you leave us no choice . You say macpherson is a threat . And you use that To justify violating warehouse protocol Time and time again . Pretty soon , y-you 're gonna be making up your own rules Just to sanction your actions . Does that sound familiar , agent nielsen , huh ? Sound like someone we both knew ? - mr. valda , he knows the rules . He knows that i 'm forced to follow them . Don 't you see that ? And if i 'm gonna take macpherson--and i am- - then rules have to be broken . That 's the only thing that 'll work . You know what 's not gonna work ? Reining in the one person That can stop him before it 's too late . Look at all of you . you 're not out in the field ! You 're here , hiding in plain sight . What are you doing ? you 're judging me . You 're judging my methods , because- - You 're af--afraid of him . Tell me i 'm wrong . - arthur ... - no , no , no , no , no . mr. valda , look at me . You tell me right to my face- - tell me i 'm wrong . Yeah , well ... Either fire me or kill me Or let me do my job .

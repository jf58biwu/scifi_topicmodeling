You can 't have that thing here . Can 't sleep with it here . That gonna help ? You never know . Does it help to sleep on the whole trunk ? Go into my bedroom again , I 'll bust your head . What happened with the ballet teacher ? Dance is the hidden language of the soul . First you have to have a soul . I mean about dimitri or the turk . I 'm going back today . What 's the status on the hand ? - got a good idea who has it . - Who ? Fbi agent ellison . Same guy that questioned me in county lockup ? What , they only have one fbi agent in this town ?

I 'd like to talk to you about sarah connor . You like to come in ? Thank you . Well , I don 't like to use the term textbook in relation to any of my patients , but sarah connor was depressed , anxiety-ridden , manic ... violent with paranoid delusions . Is that what it was ? Delusions ? Robots , soldiers of the future , apocalypse . You tell me . Also she could be remarkably charming . Even persuasive . Beware of false prophets . You a man of the book ? It has brought me comfort at times . More tea ? Um , yes , yes , thank yoU . The thing that most people don 't understand about psychiatry is that it is an imperfect science . What are you doing here ? Watching you . I 'm--I 'm a little out of shape . Teaching takes all my time . My brother says if you want to be good at anything you have to practice every day . Your brother is right . Do you have a brother ? Yes . Is he a dancer like you ? He plays chess . So does my brother . Excuse me . i can see to it that you never dance again i can see to it ... that you will never dance again Get lost . Do you have any idea who this is ? No . Do you ? Who are you ? You 're just a girl . How did you do that ? I 'm looking for your brother . Are you police ? I 've already told the police everything I know . No , I 'm not police . But I do find them useful . What do you want ? I can help your brother . Tell me where he is . Un--untie me . Hmm , fbi . That 's a good touch . What--who--who do you think I am ? I know who you are . Coming here asking about sarah connor . Yes . Matthew 7 : 15 . The full verse is , " beware of false prophets " which come to you in sheep 's clothing , but inwardly they are ravening wolves . " You 're from the future . You 're one of them . I 'm--oh , come on . Okay , if I was who you say I am , then how could- - how could you poison me ? The tea was a test . But then it occurred to me that you could be an advanced model smart enough to trick me into thinking you were passed out . Oh , come on . Look ... okay , kidnapping an fbi agent is a federal offense . Carries a sentence of life in prison . If--if you let me go now , we 'll forget this ever happened , okay ? Once you 're far away- - wait , wait , whoa , no ! You can 't , no ! No- - John hasn 't been answering his cell phone . When he gets home , you tell him we need to talk . Where you heading ? Arrowhead . I think ellison might be there . He 's a strong boy . You know , strong- - strong opinions . I don 't know where he gets that . His father ? Out of the picture . That 's too bad . Can I ask you about my brother ? Kyle ? John told me he died fighting . Do you know ... where he is now ? In the grass . I can take you there someday if you want . It 's an honest mistake . Can 't be too careful . So ... tell me . Do you believe inhe apocalypse , agent ? yeah , um ... I 've read revelations . Could it be that the apocalypse in the book and the predictions of sarah connor are one and the same ? Um , I suppose it 's possible . What do you think ? He came down the hall . It was a large man . I thought it was a man until ... he threw the guard through the window just like a rag doll . Not an ounce of emotion . This blank- - like a death mask . Then the other one came . There was two of them ? There were different . The second one was almost beautiful . Like perfect . Like a changeling . The face of mercury . What about sarah ? She was there . She was on the floor . And the boy was with her . He was screaming . And then the--the first one , the big one , I 'll never forget . He--he reached out his hand and he said , " come with me if you want to live . " Like god reaching out to man . Like- - like the sistine chapel . The hand of god . Hand of god . Yeah . Though ... there 's no proof , so we don 't talk about it . All of us who were there . What if I told you I have proof ? What do you mean ? A piece of evidence I found during my investigation . That 's why I came to you . For your corroboration . To show you that sarah wasn 't crazy . Nobody ... is crazy . What is it ? The hand of god . Good thing you told me about this . Yeah . I told you I 'm- - I 'm on your side . I wish that were true . What does that mean ? Do you know what would happen if the wrong people got a hold of this ? I can 't let you stop her . She 's dead . Well ... so was jesus once . You won 't feel a thing , I promise . What--no , no ! Dug up some clean t-shirts for you . Thanks . I wasn 't sure how many you 'd need . Depends on how long you 're staying . Not that great sleeping on the couch , is it ? Slept on a few of them myself . Yeah ? When was that ? When my mom was locked up . I kicked around . With friends and foster families . Mom was in prison ? Mental hospital . You go around blowing up buildings and ranting about robots , it happens . It sounds rough . There was this , uh- - there was this one family . Todd and janelle . I was with them for a while , and , uh ... they were okay . Of course , I hated them . They wanted to adopt me . I 'm sure your mom would 've died before she let that happen . Yeah , you 'd think . Look , john- - What can happen to a person inside four walls , um , screws with your head . Makes you do things you never thought you 'd do . Some people never give up . Some people always fight . Fewer than you think . So you ever wonder what happened to todd and janelle ? No . I know what happened . I got them killed . who is she ? my friend i told you not to bring anyone here she can help us someone could have followed you i had to tell someone. she can help us what are you thinking ? what can she help us with ? Tell him . Come on . i have money You 're the one who reported the turk missing . Do you have more ? What happened to it ? A man came to see me . Offered me money to steal the turk . I owed a lot of money to the people who helped me bring my sister into this country . So I changed the endgame protocols in order for it to lose its last match . If we 'd won , and we would 've won , I never could 've got her out of there . We--I was paid money for it . 20000 It wasn 't enough . I need more of these . Please , I need more of these . Who bought the turk ? That 's all I have . Okay ? Thank you for explaining . Where are you going ? Hey , where you go ? You promised you would help us ! Oh , my god . I 'm sorry I ever doubted you . Apology accepted . help ! help ! get up ! Where is it ? She took it . What ? Who ? Sarah connor . She took it . She took it . Did you find the turk ? Dimitri stole it from andy , then sold it to a man . Who ? Where 's dimitri now ? Dead . So is his sister . Did you kill them ? No . It wasn 't my mission . I never wanted you to see that tape . I was gonna destroy it . But since you did , did you notice the date ? The date on the tape . June 8,1997 . Do you know that date ? I do now . That 's the date you gave up being my mother . That 's the date I broke out of there . The day you came for me , I was coming for you . Because about three seconds after I signed that paper , I knew I couldn 't live without it . I was coming for you , and I was gonna die trying . You almost did . So did you . And you were mad as hell about it . You yelled at me . Told me what a stupid move it was . I might 've oversold that a little . I 'll always find you . I 'll always find you . there was a time I was a hero to my son . He thought I walked on water . He knows better now . We all have weak moments . Moments where we lose faith . But it 's our flaws , our weaknesses , that make us human . They 're here . They 're here . They 're here ! They 're everywhere ! They 're here ! They 're here ! science now performs miracles like the gods of old , creating life from blood cells , or bacteria , or a spark of metal . But they 're perfect creatures . And in that way , they couldn 't be less human . There are things machines will never do . Theyannot possess faith . They cannot commune with god . " every tree that no bringeth forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire . " they cannot appreciate beauty . They cannot create art . If they ever learn these things , they won 't have to destroy us . They 'll be us . Terminator The Sarah Chronicles Season 01 Episode 07

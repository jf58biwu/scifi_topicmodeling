 I didn 't want to . I 'm not in control . I know . Tell me you love me . I love you . We 're out of Stoli ! You put it down , right ? with other memorable products ... The amazing smokeless ashtray ... The rhinestone and stud setter , bottle and jar cutter , the pottery wheel ... Becca ! What ? The music 's too loud . What now ? Why 's the door locked ? What were you doing ? Where is it ? Where 's what ? You 're not allowed to be near a computer plugged into a phone line . Or do I have to show you the court order ? Yeah , well , why don 't you e-mail it to me ? Becca . Go ahead . Tear the room apart . Do you see a computer in here ? No . Which means that the only thing that 's in here that doesn 't belong is drum roll please , you ! I 'm driving you to school in 10 minutes . Too easy . That 's not real food . You 're not a real mom . What 's your problem ? You know , Dad didn 't try to control me . Dad trusted me , okay ? Dad dropped you off on my doorstep . You want to live with Dad ? Live with Dad , if you can find him . Here 's what you do . Look for a big protest rally . Then find the nearest bar . You think you remember , but you don 't . The victim of a Baghdad car-bombing . Needed transplants and facial reconstructions . This triathlete was told he 'd never compete again . For some women , bigger is better . What these people have in common is that they have each , on some level , altered themselves . But , where 's the threshold ? When is it okay to intervene in God 's work ? This question is the very cornerstone of bioethics , and we 're gonna spend the rest of the semester dealing with it . Come on , Will . I 'm a bartender and a dropout . You 're a professor . And a surgeon . How can you take me seriously ? What makes you think I take you seriously ? Do you ? Why are you with me ? You 're different . From what ? When your whole life 's planned out for you while you 're still in the womb , it kind of kills the mystery . And then you came along , and you were unexpected . Unexpected ? The one choice my father didn 't make for me . I got to run . We still on for dinner ? 8 : 00 ? Make it 8 : 30 . I have to go to the lab for a few hours . While we 're on the subject , why are you with me ? You 're not entirely uncharming . It 's insulting . The last time I left you alone you started a fire . Yeah , the microwave was broken . We don 't have a microwave . Look , they 're weird . They 're my friends . Yeah , they 're your weird friends . Please , for me ? Tomorrow night . Double feature ? Deal . Wow ! You look rocking . I brought pheromones . I got to go . I 'm gonna be late . Be good . Have fun . I think there 's a pretty good chance the grant will come through . The institute 's indicating it 's a done deal . And I hear Paris is great in the spring ... You 're not happy . Of course I 'm happy . Because I think you should come with me . I can 't . Why not ? I have a job . Jaime ... And a life . We 're talking Paris . And I have responsibilities . Did I mention it 's Paris ? I 'm pregnant . Yeah , that 's what I said . I don 't want you to ... I just ... I know this isn 't something you just spring on someone , except for the part where that 's exactly what I am doing to you right now . And I know you 're in a place where you can 't even think about it , and , God , I 'm only 24 and it 's not ... I mean , I said to myself , there 's only one thing to do , but I would never ... Five months , fourteen days , that 's how long we 've been dating . Jaime , if somebody had asked me five months and fifteen days ago if I believed in love at first sight , I would have said I absolutely did not . And the very next day , I would 've been proved wrong . Will ... Marry me . So , I 'm thinking " Coltrane " if it 's a boy , " Billie " if it 's a girl . You don 't have to do this , you know ... Actually , I 'm pretty sure you have to name them . I mean you don 't have to ... I know , and I 'm still asking . So , what does that tell you ? Jaime ? Jaime ? Looks like massive internal bleeding . Multisystem trauma . Extensive crush injuries to right arm and both legs . She 's coming up ! I need five milligrams of midazolam ! Will ? You 're gonna be okay , baby . We 're going to put you back to sleep . It 's gonna be all right . I promise . It 's gonna be okay . BP 95 palp . Pulse ox is 90l20 . Multiple compound radial and ulnar fractures of the right arm , severed brachial artery . Right arm 's a shredder . We 're looking at complete AK amputation on both legs . Neurovascular damage is catastrophic . We 've lost the fetal heartbeat . Dr. Anthros , BP 's falling , 80 systolic . Prep her . Dr. Anthros , we can 't ... Do it ! Why didn 't somebody stop him ? He has full clearance . We didn 't have the authority to stop him . It 's the price you pay for working with a so-called genius . Guess he must 've left his IQ in the car . Keep reading the ulnar nerve . Significant damage . Should I intervene ? No . This operation , this patient , doesn 't officially exist . We have deniability . It 's a freebie . We can always terminate later , need be . Meanwhile , get Jae . It will have to be re-sected to its branch point . Radial nerve appears to be intact . Check on the sensitivity levels . I need some pressure trackers . Forgive me , father , for I have sinned . The doctor , did you kill him ? It was like a ride at Disneyland . Which one ? I 've never been . I 'll take you . You 'll love it . It 's all fat people , with fat children , walking around aimlessly , too stupid to know the difference . Do you miss it , the way things were ? If I could remember , I 'm sure I would . Do I remind you of her ? Your skin . Tell me you love me . Jaime ? What happened ? There was an accident . You 're okay . The baby . What about the baby ? Oh , God ... There was no permanent damage . You 'll be able to get pregnant again . Why can 't I feel my legs ? Okay , Jaime , I need to tell you something ... What 's happening to me ? I need to tell you about what I do . And you need to listen to me . I can 't feel my arm . Listen to me , Jaime . Both your legs , and your arm , had to be replaced . Also , your right ear , and right eye . Molecular machines , anthrocytes , have been substituted for one-eighth of your blood cells . Now you should have lacerations bone-deep all over your face , but the anthrocytes are healing you at an exponential rate . All of you . They 're making you better . Jaime ... Leave me alone ! It was a dream . The bionics enhance baseline human strength , and then some . What have you done to me ? Jaime ... Why did you do this to me ? You were going to die . Sir . Born Jaime Wells Sommers . Van Horne , Iowa . February 23 , 1983 . Mother deceased , cancer . She 's clean , except for a sealed court record from 1998 . What 's in it ? It 's sealed . Unseal it . I 'm working on it . I think she 's a good candidate . Well , let 's pretend I 'm soliciting opinions . Why ? She 's stable . I pulled up an old Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory . I liked what I saw . Plus the situation with her sister shows loyalty . And she 's smart . I found an old IQ test . How 'd she do ? A little better than you , sir . Jae , can you train her ? Well , the last one we screened , tested , there were psych evaluations , and she was a soldier . Look where that got us . We always talked about non-military applications . Here 's our chance . Your opinion isn 't valid here . You 're too close to the subject . This from the guy who played house with the last one ? Let 's get fresh data . I want you to sit her down . All right . You know , I once had a wolf . Now , a wolf only makes a good pet if he thinks he 's a dog . Your girlfriend , we 're keeping her here against her will . How long until she realizes that no one can make her do anything against her will ? You 're talking about killing a human . I 'm talking about killing a wolf . You know what scares me about you ? Your father . He seemed normal , too . If I 'm anything like my father , you just made a big mistake . All right , we have to get you to rehab . What for ? Rehabilitation . I 'm not the one performing human experiments and keeping people prisoner . You rehabilitate yourself . Boo . I 'm Ruth . I 'm pissed . Good . We 're here to talk about our feelings . How do you feel about me being kept here against my will ? I was speaking editorially . Actually , we 're here to talk about your feelings . Something no one seems to have any regard for . Curve balls will do that . You can have all the contingency plans you like and then someone goes and does something like this , and then we all have to stay after school ... And talk about our feelings . Your feelings . Right . After all , feelings are what got us here in the first place . You like to draw . True or false ... I have a sister ... She 's staying with your landlady . She thinks you 're skiing in Vail . This is where you stayed . It looks nice . You had fun , except for the part where Will injured his arm skiing into a tree . Does this mean I 'll be going home at some point ? It means that we have a contingency plan , should you be going home at some point . We also have a plan , should you not . True or false ? You can 't teach an old dog new tricks . You would have done the same thing . You never met my wife , did you ? For two years , I watched her die in a hospital , while they disassembled her , and the whole time , I knew all I had to do to save her was bring her here , but saving my wife was not the mission . Ruth says she 's stable . How long till she 's combat-ready ? She 's a civilian . Everyone has to sing for their supper around here , Will , or haven 't you figured that out yet ? How long until the rest of her implants come online ? She likes to draw . I don 't care . I think you 'll care about this . Who did they bury ? I mean , did you ever see the body ? You show this to anybody else ? Just you . Keep it that way . Security breach . All personnel report . Security breach . Security breach . I can 't protect you in here , but once you 're on the outside ... Why should I trust you ? Because I 'm the only one you can trust . Go back to your life like none of this ever happened . I 'll work it out with them . What about you ? Come on guys . Let 's move ! Go . Now . All right , so I 'll have those faxed over to you by Friday afternoon , and we 're still on for that meeting tomorrow ? Okay , good . Yep . Mmm-hmm . Mommy , there 's a lady out there running really fast , like as fast as a car . Sweetie , what did I tell you about making things up ? I just thought it was cool that a girl could do that . That 's all . Let her go . What the hell did you do ? You want her , right ? For the program ? I 'll make her understand what 's at stake . Just let me have time ... Time to what ? Letting her go is not a bad idea . If you want her loyalty , give her freedom . Or , the illusion of freedom . All right . Everybody , stand down . Let 's go . Let 's bounce . You 're making a mistake . Listen to me . The accident wasn 't an accident . According to the autopsy , the driver 's neck was broken an hour before the crash . Which means someone else was driving that truck . We need to find out who . Jaime ? It 's Will . Jaime , if you 're there , pick up the phone . I need to talk to you . Jaime , please ... There are things I need to tell you about , before they happen . Nice of you to show up . I 'm sorry . Yeah ? What for ? For leaving , and not telling you first . How was skiing ? It was fine . Dad used to always say , " Don 't believe anything until it 's been denied . " Becca ... Look , don 't lie to me , okay ! We both know you don 't ski . So , where were you ? I ... I can 't tell you . Coffee ? Sure . It 's no smoking . What are you , a forest ranger ? Something like that . Must be scary , alone in the forest , just you and the animals . Not if they know who 's in charge . Hey ! Wait up ! Guard ! We both know you work in a super-max prison , a thousand feet below Florence . We both know this is the place where they stick people when they 've outlived their usefulness . I don 't know who you are ... If you don 't do exactly what I say , my brother 's gonna carve your wife , Barbara , up like Venus de Milo . Oh , God , Bobby ! Help me . How 'd you do it ? Do you know what they call creatures that can live comfortably in environments considered lethal , say , for instance , 1000 feet below the Earth 's surface ? How did you do it ? Extremophiles . I 'll do an impression of one for you . You ready ? How did you ... What ? How did I do what ? Sarah Corvus is still alive . And you came all the way here to tell me that ? Let me do another impression for you , the impression of a man who 's been stabbed in the back , stripped of his rights , and thrown in a hole like a dog . Sarah Corvus is a time bomb . We both know it . Well , time bombs only matter to those who have time . Goodbye , Jae . Please give my regards to Will . Tell him Daddy says hello . Guards ? If I may make an observation , you seem way too innocent and sweet to be behind a bar . You should be out there with the rest of ' em . Finally , I 'm not the only person who feels that way . What can I get you ? Beer . On the house . Thank you . Don 't I know you ? We met very briefly . We didn 't even actually meet . Where ? Guess . Are you all right ? Yeah . Let me take a look at it . No , it 's okay ... Are you okay ? Come on , your husband will never know . Come on , what do you say ? Are you all right ? Let me help you . Just breathe . It 's like that , the first time the ear and eye inputs come online . It 's too much information . You have to learn how to focus it , and turn it off and on at will . You 're a fast healer . The anthrocytes are doing their job . Who are you ? Who are you ? Jaime . Jaime . Tell everyone Sarah Corvus says hello . Hey , yo ! Looking for something ? You need something ? Huh ? Come here , baby . I got what you need . Please . Please don 't ... Don 't ... Are you okay ? Tell me what you put in my head . Jaime ... I almost killed a man . I didn 't even know what I was doing . What did you put in my head ? Microscopic chips have been implanted in your cerebral cortex . My father developed the technology for the military . The program was meant to help amputees in the Gulf . Of course , he saw the combat applications immediately . You made me into a soldier . You 're hard-wired for highly specialized warfare , yes . I was gonna kill him . I would have ... But , you didn 't . You 're still in control , and with the proper training ... Training ? Jaime , we 're the only ones that can protect you . Let me protect you . How can you protect me if you 're scared of me ? I never meant for any of this to touch you . I didn 't . I just ... I couldn 't bear to lose you . That isn 't even me . Yes , it is . Hey . Hey . I have to get back to Becca . I can 't keep leaving her like this . Jaime ... What do you people do anyway ? It 's complicated . Try me . The world 's further along than anyone wants to admit . Technology 's at the point where science fiction isn 't fiction anymore . We keep that technology from getting into the wrong hands . Who gets to decide right from wrong ? What about Sarah Corvus ? Where does she figure in all this ? Where did you hear that name ? Where did you hear that name , Jaime ? Will ! Will ? I 'm sorry . Just hold on , okay ? Where is she ? I need everyone . Time out . The anthrocytes in our blood can filter out any impurities in our lungs . Fringe benefit of being a freak . What do you want from me ? Honestly , I 'm not sure . Jogging partner ? Who are you ? Without being too melodramatic about the whole thing , I 'm Sarah Corvus , the first bionic woman . Ta-da ! So , what did they replace ? I figured the eyes and the ears . What else ? Me , they did both arms , both legs . Only one eye . Anthros wasn 't sure about the optical interface . So , I did the other one myself . Part of my chest , too . I 'm cutting away all the parts of me that are weak . Time in . You only have one bionic arm ... You should really do something about that . You 're gonna have to do a little better than that . How am I doing now ? Not bad . Not bad at all . We have a 39-year-old male Caucasian gunshot victim , to the left shoulder . Request assistance from Mercy General . Ten-four , notifying Mercy General . Transport when ready . Will gonna make it ? Miss Sommers . Just wanted to get a look at you . Who are you ? You have $ 50 million worth of my property inside you , so I guess you could say I 'm your landlord . What do you want from me ? I don 't know . Maybe you died three days ago , and you just haven 't realized it yet . Is that a threat ? There are no free agents here , Miss Sommers . Sooner or later , you 're gonna have to make a choice that goes something like this . Heads , you lose , tails , you die . Welcome to the game . Hey ! If we do this , whatever this is , we do it on my terms . If that 's not okay with you , I know what I 'm capable of now . So , you send whoever you send , and I 'll bury one guy after the next . You understand me ? By the way , Sarah Corvus says hello . Tell Jae we have a candidate . What are you doing ? I haven 't seen the moon in a thousand and twenty-three days . It hasn 't changed . Let 's go . We have work to do .

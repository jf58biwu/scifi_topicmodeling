 Over the last 60 years 4400 people have been abducted All at once they were returned With no memory of where they 've been They haven 't aged a day And some have returned with new abilities All are trying to reconnect with a life interrupted We 're not a threat . We 're salvation . The world will have to deal with us . Previously on the 4400 ... Lily , are you all right ? - Where 's my wife ? - What are you talking about ? Mr. Tyler , when your wife fainted this morning , she was a young woman . When she woke up less than a minute later , she was 50 years older . Are you my mother ? Richard , I 'm dying . I understand there was an incident this morning . You attempted to harm yourself . You had no right to do that ! Don 't you understand who you are ? What you 're here to do ? I 'm injecting myself with a modified version of the promicin serum . I will have taught my body how to produce promicin , and then I will be the first non-returnee to develop 4400 abilities . That was T.J. Kim running from the courthouse . When she hit this place , T.J. drove every man in the building into a homicidal rage . Ever since we took them off the inhibitor , they 're either developing new abilities or they 're refining the ones they 've got . So they are getting more dangerous . You saved my life . I owe you . You sold us out . I don 't guess we 'll be seeing her in court any time soon . This is a message from the Nova Group . We are the defensive wing of the 4400 . Today , the world has seen what happens to those who try to harm us . A new era dawns . Hi . Need your auxiliary rounds as well , agent Baldwin . Oh , yeah . Of course . I forgot , Ian . Thanks . You can go in . Great . Hi , T.J. What do you want ? Dr. Burkhoff ? I have your prescriptions . Hello ? Say something if you 're here . Don 't . Please . I 've been having migraines . How severe ? Bad enough . Don 't worry . They 're just headaches . I 've been getting them for years . 7 : 45 You 're just in time for my wake-up call . These promicine shots , How many a day are you up to now ? Six . You 've doubled your dosage ? I thought you weren 't going to do that without talking to me . We 're talking now . Look , I 'm training my body to produce a new neurotransmitter . And I guarantee you I 'm not the only one trying . The moment the first 4400 manifested an ability , an arms race began . Someone is going to produce a promicin serum that will cause non-4400s to develop extraordinary abilities . It will happen . The only questions are : who 's going to do it and who 's going to control it . Hopefully someone with a highly developed sense of responsibility ... - and some judgment . - Let me ask you ... You meet a lot of people like that in your day-to-day affairs ? Do a lot of them hold high-ranking government posts or sit on the board of giant pharmaceutical companies ? Dr. Burkhoff ... I knew that you had some ... personality quirks , but I never pegged you for a cynic . I can 't afford to have a charitable view of human nature . There 's too much at stake here . If these experiments cost me some headaches ... some sores ... I 'd say that 's a price worth paying . Wouldn 't you ? I 'm here , right ? Holy mother ! Why are we doing this ? Everything I 'm telling you , it 's all in my file . You know it already . Relax , T.J. I just think it 's important we review everything you 've told the government so far . - Have we ? - Yes . I keep telling you just that 's everything I know . Thanks for your cooperation . We 're just trying to consolidate information . You 'd be amazed how hard that can be in a bureaucracy . Yeah , well , I hope you don 't expect me to say " you 're welcome . " What are you doing ? What , this ? It 's nothing . I 'm just interrupting intimity . Get geared up . We 're leaving in two minutes . What for ? What 's going on ? Your partner registered to see T.J. Kim this morning . When Tom left the interview room , T.J. was dead . Two gunshot wounds to the head . Apparently , Tom snack a small firearm into the interrogation room . By the time the guard went into the room and found T.J. ' S body , Tom had already left the building . - We 're going to pick him up right now . - Wait , wait . This is Tom we 're talking about here . There 's got to be some explanation . Maybe T.J. used her ability on him . No , she had concentrated promicin inhibitor pumping through her veins . We 've tried to contact Tom , but he hasn 't been picking up his phone . - We need to get him in here ... - Okay , okay . just let me talk to him first . He trusts me . Now , this is Tom . Come on , we owe him that much . Yeah , okay . I wasn 't trying to drown myself . - I don 't even know if I could . - Okay . Isabelle , I just thought that after everything that happened with Lily ... Shawn ... This has nothing to do with my mother . I was teaching myself to swim . In your clothes ? Well , I never wore a bathing suit before . I didn 't know what to get . And I 'm too old to ask for help . It 's embarrassing not knowing how to swim . Everybody 's got to learn sometime , Isabelle . I learned when I was a kid . But I never was a kid . That 's why I never learned how to swim , or how to drive , or ever went out on a date . I keep reading about all these ... rites of passage . Like stuff everyone goes through before they grow up ? Yeah , but I am grown up . And I missed out on all of it . It 's not fair . I 've got to catch up , so I made a list . A list ? That 's pretty organized . Well , Isabelle , there 's a pool at the center . I could probably teach you the basics . Really ? Thanks , Shawn . Dad ? How old were you when you learned how to swim ? By 11 , I guess . Why ? You want me to teach you ? That 's okay , Shawn said he 'd do it . Oh really , did he ? Well , just make sure he doesn 't throw you in the deep end right away . That 's what my grandmother did to me . Look , Isabelle ... I 'm going to be gone overnight . If you need anything , go and see Shawn . Where are you going ? I 'm going to take your mother home . I 'm putting her to rest . Well , can I come with you ? I don 't think so . I 'm flying , and ... To tell you the truth ... I don 't think you 're ready to be away from the center yet . You want to be alone with her when you say goodbye , don 't you ? Yeah , I guess I do . - Tom . - Oh God ! You scared the hell out of me , Diana . What are you doing here ? Why is your gun out ? What the hell is going on ? Jarvis is on her way over . She 's got everyone with her . You need to come in . Why ? What are you talking about ? You shot T.J. Kim this morning . - What ? - You don 't remember ? Don 't remember ? I didn 't shoot anybody . - I 've been here all morning . - Can someone confirm that ? No , no , I was supposed to have a conference call with Kyle 's attorney they canceled , though . Look , I took a half a personal day , Diana . I went jogging . I wasn 't at work . You got to stop saying that , because two dozen people saw you there . Now , I don 't know what 's going on . I ... Maybe you 're blacking out , like Kyle did . Maybe it 's something else . Maybe it 's like some 4400 ability . I mean , I don 't know , but ... You gotta come in . And what happens if I do ? I get arrested for murder ? You know , we 'll figure it out , okay ? Everyone wants to help you . You just ... You just have to come in . - You mind if I get dressed first ? - Sure . Are you sure you remember everything you did this morning ? There 's no time gaps or anything ? You didn 't take a nap ? Tom ? Damn it ! Yeah , hi . It 's me . He got away . I don 't know how . They only sent one agent after him . Look , sorry . He got away . What ? No way . He 's an NTAC agent . They 'll be expecting that . You 're right . This has to happen . I 'll do it . I was letting him get dressed . I didn 't think he would jump from a second story window . Well , obviously , you underestimated your partner 's resolve . - Does he still seem blameless to you ? - I don 't know , look ... It was a really bad call , and I take full responsibility . I 've alerted local law enforcement , the FBI . I 've told them that Tom is wanted for questioning in connection with a murder . He 's a fugitive now . Oh , don 't give me that look , Diana . I had no choice . Sorry . It 's tom . Tom ? - I 'm sorry I ran out on you . - Where are you ? I didn 't killed T.J. I didn 't kill anyone . I believe you . But you have to come in , and we can figure out what 's going on . - No , I 'm not going to jail . - No one 's going to put you in prison . They did it to my son , Diana . Was it really him that pulled the trigger the day Jordan Collier died ? No , it wasn 't , was it ? It wasn 't Kile , still he 's incarcerated . You 're a fugitive , Tom . Every PD in Washington is looking for you . Some local cop wants to be a hero , spots you , you know how these things can end . These things gonna end when I prove that I didn 't do this . Look , dig around , Diana . There 's got to be some evidence that will clear me . Just ... Help me find it . Did he give you a location ? Marco , help me out here . If you were trying to prove that your partner didn 't commit a crime that the whole world thinks he did ... Where would you start ? Well , I guess I 'd start by pretending that my partner wasn 't involved . Okay , just think of it like any other case . What 's the first thing you do when you start ? Well , look at the evidence . I mean , there 's a dead body , there 's the gun that Tom left behind , and there 's a bunch of people that saw him here . Well , they 've got security cameras down in the detention ward , right ? You 're serious ? You 're really asking me for all that footage ? Of course I 'm serious . Is that a problem ? Well , it 's just ... I gave all the tapes to him , like an hour ago . What are you talking about ? I haven 't been up here all day . What is this , a joke ? Marco , come on ! You were just here . You signed for all the footage from the detention ward . This isn 't so hard . That 's because I haven 't let go yet . All right ... I 'm going to move my hands . Are you ready ? No , not yet . I 'm kind of comfortable . You 're kind of comfortable ? I 'm freezing . I don 't know what 's going on . - This pool 's supposed to be heated . - Want me to make it warmer ? - You can do that ? - I think so . Hold on . How did you do that ? I don 't know . How do you heal ? It 's not the same , Isabelle . Healing 's one thing . That 's what we can all do ... one thing . Not me . I guess I 'm different . Shawn . Sorry to barge in . We 're scheduled to brief the board of directors . - That 's starting now ? - Five minutes ago . They 're on hold . Alana . Thomas ? What are you doing here ? I 'm in trouble . My bosses at NTAC , they think I did something . I need you to come with me . - What are you talking ... - I don 't have time to explain . Thomas ! - Hello ? - Alana , I 'm right down the street . I need you to come meet me . Honey , I 'm in trouble . Everyone thinks I killed somebody . Who is this ? I know it 's not Thomas . What are you talking about ? I 'm looking at Thomas right now . Honey , listen , that 's not me ! The man you 're looking at , he can impersonate me somehow . I don 't believe you . He walked into NTAC and he shot someone this morning . Alana , he 's dangerous . Get away from him ! Alana , listen to me . Your mother 's middle name is Madeleine . You wanted a dog when you were a kid , but your parents gave you a bird instead , a parakeet named Charlie . Listen , we made love last night . There were two candles burning . Just hold on ! I 'll be right there . Did I have a dog when I was a girl ? - I don 't have time for this . - What are you doing ? Tom ? - Are you all right ? - Yes . - Where is he ? - He just ran through the back . Did you see a guy come down this alley ? He looked exactly like me . - I didn 't see anybody . - You 're sure ? He 's gone . He 's gone ... What do you mean ? He just ran out a few seconds ago . There was no one here . Just some kid . It was him . It had to be . I had him . I had him ! Had who ? What kid are you talking about ? The one who 's impersonating me . The guy who 's framing me for murder . He looked like you . He sounded like you . He was standing as close as you are right now , and he had me completely fooled . Don 't feel bad . He fooled every one at NTAC , too . At least we know what 's going on now . He 's a 4400 , isn 't he ? Somehow he can pass himself off as you . Yeah . I 'm not sure how . I mean , maybe he 's got some kind of optical camouflage . He can convince your brain you 're talking to whoever he wants you to see . He 's a boy . Why would he want to kill anyone ? Not just anybody . T.J. Kim . The one member of the Nova Group we had in custody . I mean , think about it , it 's a good plan . You get rid of the one member of your cell who could testify against you , you compromise a government agent , and NTAC . The one agency that 's trying to hunt you down , is wasting their time chasing one of their own . Alana ! You might want to get in here . There 's all kinds of people flashing badges everywhere . They said they 're NTAC agents . Look , stall them . I want you to go home . I want you to lock the doors , and don 't open it until this is all cleared up . If I need to get a hold of you ... I 'll use a password . How about " Death in Venice " ? Your favorite book . That 's a good choice . Listen , Shawn , thanks for letting me come in here . I know I put you at risk . I just didn 't know where else to go . Look , you guys must have a database of 4400s here , right ? I need to get a look at it . Find out who this kid is . I can pull it up on my laptop for you . This might take a while . You mind if I let myself out ? Yeah , that 's fine . There you go . You know , Uncle Tommy , you can stay here if you want . - I might take you up on it . - All right . But hey , you get the couch . Kidneys , huh ? That explains the blood in the urine . Kevin , we had a deal . I was going to help you through this as long as it wasn 't compromising your health . Well , guess what ... I 'm calling the hospital . But they won 't let me take my shots ! Oh , no . You 're done with your shots . I know we had an agreement , and I 'll honor it . Just ... Let me show you something before you call . What happened to your fingernails ? Uh , they fell off . Dissolved , I guess you 'd say . If you 're trying to change my mind , you 're not doing a very good ... Kevin ... What the hell did you just do ? Kevin , you 've developed a 4400 ability . It 's getting there . It doesn 't always work . The scar went off the back of your hand . I know . I was nervous about that . It 's so fun to drive fast ! All that information about compression rates and and gear ratios just seems completely irrelevant . Well , you 're not driving home . Get out of there . You 're lucky you didn 't wrap my car around a pole . Is there anything on this list of yours that involves , you know , a little less risk of bodily harm ? We could have sex ! Come on . You 've a big bed . Isabelle , hey ... Uh , no . Why ? It 's on my list . It 's an important rite of passage into adulthood . It 'll be fun ! I was good at driving . I 'm sure you 'll catch on real quick . I don 't know ... For one thing , your dad would kill me . Why ? I 'm an adult . Well , you are and you aren 't , Isabelle . Let 's just say he has a right to have an opinion on the matter . I don 't know , Isabelle . I feel like I 'd be taking advantage of you . But I want to . Well , I 'm flattered . I really am . But I just don 't think you 're ready to make that decision . We barely know each other . I know you better than I know anyone else in the world . That may be true . It 's still not going to happen . Lessons with Isabelle going well ? They 're not lessons , and it 's completely innocent . Do me a favor and don 't ask about them again . This is Skouris . His name 's Boyd Gelder , Diana . He 's a 4400 . I know where he lives . Where who lives ? Who 's Boyd Gelder ? The kid who 's doing this . He can imitate me somehow . And not just imitate . He can ... be me . At least , make you think he 's me . He lives with his mom . I 'm in Schenley Park . It 's right by his house . Well , can you wait for me ? I 'll be 15 minutes . I 'll wait ... But Diana , just you . Just me . We just got here . Where you going ? Schenley Park . I think we caught a break on Tom 's case . Tom ! I didn 't tell anyone , Tom . Just Marco . At least , I thought it was Marco . I looked across the park . You were standing there . It was you ... - But it wasn 't . - Tell me about it . You weren 't the one actually chasing yourself across the park ? I mean , I don 't really run like that , do I ? It 's an amazing ability . Marco 's going to have a field day over this . Good . Get him working on it . We 're going to need a way to handle this guy . Wait , wait , wait . No , you don 't need to skulk around anymore . You can come in with me now . I 'm still on the hook for murder , Diana . No , you 're not ! Boyd posed as you . He shot T.J. Kim . You 're not responsible . Listen , I just saw his abilities with my own eyes . That 's proof of something right there . I will back you up on everything you say . Which means exactly nothing . I mean , thank you , Diana , but you 're my partner . Everyone expects you to stand up for me . There 's only one way to prove I didn 't kill T.J. Kim . I have to get Boyd Gelder . Okay , let 's go . You sure you want to come ? I 'm your partner . Everyone expects that I 'll stand up for you . I should be back by tonight . I 've ... been taking my time , stopping off at all the places your mother liked . Everything okay ? You been going to your doctors ' appointments ? - Most of them . - Isabelle ... We need to keep monitoring you . I 'm fine . Shawn 's taking good care of me , just like you asked . He 's doing a really good job . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . He taught me the backstroke , he let me drive his car ... And then I asked him to have sex with me , but he said no . He said you 'd be angry . Is that true ? Isabelle ... You 're too young to be thinking about ... - that . - I am ? But I thought I was almost 20 . How old were you when you lost your virginity ? It was ... Things were a bit different in my day . It 's not the same . It 's not ? Why ? You know what , Isabelle ? I 'm not having this conversation with you over the phone . So Shawn was right . You are mad . I don 't understand . What does NTAC want to talk to my son for , anyway ? He 's in some trouble . We can 't discuss it . We just need to talk to him . Well , he 's not here . He went away on a ski trip with some friends , and he won 't be back till tomorrow . Ma 'am ... Your son is not on a ski trip , and this is serious . Is there any way you can contact him ? First tell me what 's going on . I mean , what is it you think my son did ? Mrs. Gelder , there are a lot of agents looking for Boyd . Situations like this can get very chaotic . People get hurt . The sooner we get to your son , the safer he 'll be . So why don 't you call him and convince him you need to see him . Boyd 's late . I wonder if he 'll even show . Let 's just give him another few minutes . Nice mom , nice house ... Makes you wonder ... if the Nova Group can turn this kid , who else have they gotten to ? Everyone keeps telling the 4400 they 're here to save the world . Whatever that means . Exactly . Say what you like about Nova . They do seem to have a game plan . I 'm sure that ends with a flooding pitch . Well , I 'm just guessing , but I don 't think that 's Boyd . How the hell did NTAC get here ? Maybe Boyd figured out it was a trap and tipped them off . - Thomas ! - Alana , open up ! What the hell are you doing here ? There are NTAC agents watching the house . They just drove away . They must be changing shifts . Come on , let me in . Death in Venice , okay ? Open up . I don 't want anyone to see me stand up here , come on . What did you do with your key ? I lost it . I must have lost it while I was running around . Come on , it 's me , Tom , Alana . I gave you the password . Please don 't make me . I don 't have anything against you . Tom ... It says it 's your house . - Alana ? - I just wrote a letter on your computer . You need to come sign it . - Boyd ? - It 's a confession . It says you cracked under the strain and murder charges against your son . You shot T.J. , and now you can 't live with it . So you 've decided to kill yourself . Where 's Alana ? What did you do ? It 's my " get out of jail free " card . See , you 're the only one who could identify me . Everyone else , they 've just been seeing double . - They 'll sound crazy . - I 'm not signing a suicide note , Boyd . Put Alana on the phone . Oh , you 'll sign . 'cause either I shoot you ... or I shoot her . It 's a trade . Your life for hers . You know what ? I don 't think I can let you do this , Tom . We need to call Jarvis . We need to block off the street . We need to surround your house . He has Alana . Tom , he wants to kill you . The least thing we can do is make it a little bit difficult for him . If it was Maia in there ... Would you call Jarvis ? Do you like it ? Why did you bring this to me ? You 're a young woman . A young woman should have a nice dress . It 's going to look good on you . See for yourself . Thank you . I see you 've been spending a lot of time with Shawn . So ? I think it 's wonderful . Shawn 's a very isolated young man . He doesn 't get to spend much time around people his own age . I think ... you should get as close to him as you can . Matthew ? Shawn 's nice . What I 'm doing with him is not for you , and it 's not because I 'm trying to use him . Of course not . But eventually , Isabelle , you and Shawn are going to be on opposite sides of a very large ideological divide . So ... Enjoy your friendship ... But don 't let your emotions run too deep . If you do ... It 'll make things more difficult later . What things ? You 'll know . It doesn 't match your eyes . You should take care of that . You were beautiful women . Both of you . You looked exactly alike . I never could figure out why . One way or the other , I 've had a Lily in my life for over 50 years . That 's all gone now ... And I don 't know what I 'm going to do ... But , uh ... It makes me feel better knowing the two of you are together . Forever . This is it for you , you know . I don 't know what kind of fairy tale the Nova Group sold you , but it doesn 't matter what happens to me , or Tom . Your life is over . They sent you on a suicide mission . I volunteered . And I don 't think you 're in any spot to be giving me advice . You 're a 4400 . You 're special . You 're supposed to be changing things . Instead , you ... live with an NTAC agent . And what are you going to change , Boyd ? You killed a girl . How does that make the world better ? T.J. Kim was a soldier . She would rather have me put a bullet in her head than betray us . Everyone talks about saving the world . Meanwhile , for the past 50 years , everything 's been turning bad , one disaster after another ... But we 're going to show the world a new way . We 're going to take them down a new path ... By force , if we 'd have to . Why can 't you see the real catastrophe is to sit back and do nothing ? Did you hear that ? Stop it ! Stop it , both of you ! Stop , or I 'll shoot . - Nice work , Alana . We got him . - Shut up ! - Alana , Death in Venice . - Yeah , that 's the password . Come on , Alana , give me the gun . We 'll call NTAC . It 's over . Alana , it 's me , Tom . Ask me a question . Anything . Don 't fall for it . He 's probably ... read my file . He knows everything about us . Don 't listen to him . Ask me something about us . Something only I would know . Anything about us . Shut up ! Both of you . Baby ... I am so proud of you . Billy would have been proud . You know about Billy ? Yeah . That was your son . He died in a car accident . Alana , he did research . Anyone could find that out . Give me the gun . Just give me ... give me the gun . Alana , give me the gun . No . Alana ... Give me the gun . Get down on the ground . What ? No , no , you 've got the wrong one . Think about this . I said get down . Stay still , Boyd . Don 't move . You 're just a boy . I 'm a soldier . And there are more of us every day . Let 's go , soldier . Hey . - Welcome back . - Yeah , thanks . Everything go okay ? Yeah , thank you , and ... thank you for keeping an eye on Isabelle . Oh , well ... It 's not a problem . Didn 't really do much . Yeah , well , thank you anyway . I worry about her . Well , you don 't really need to . She seems to be getting along really well . I 'm her father . It 's my job . And it 's harder with Isabelle . People see her , they see a woman . A beautiful woman ... And they might forget that inside she 's just a little girl . Still ... I 'm glad she has you around ... To be a friend . Shawn ... - How did you get in here ? - I can do stuff , remember ? So , what 's up ? What do you need ? Just one thing . It 's on my list . First kiss . This isn 't smart , Isabelle . Okay . Traduction par Cedr _ c et Emiliezim Synchro par Kiff , correction par Vovo

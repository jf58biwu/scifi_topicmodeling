 Blonsky , pull back now . Pull back ! Is that all you got ? - Fall back ! Fall back ! Let 's go , let 's go ! Find cover ! Betty ! Fire , goddamn it ! Bruce ? Stop firing ! No ! You did the right thing , calling us . I need to know where they 're going . She 'll be in incredible danger as long as she 's with him . From who ? He protected her . You almost killed her . I give you my word , her safety is my main concern at this point . You know , it 's a point of professional pride with me that I can always tell when somebody 's lying . And you are . I don 't know where he 's going . - I know she 'll help him , if she can . - Then she 's aiding a fugitive . And I can 't help either one of them . I used to wonder why she never talked about you . Now I know ! Where does she meet these guys ? Bruce ? Bruce . It 's okay . It 's okay . Come here . Come this way . Watch your head . Okay . We 're okay . It 's okay . It 's just the rain . Will he ever walk again ? Most of the bones in his body look like crushed gravel right now . I will say this for him . He 's got a heart like a machine . Never seen anything like it , outside of a racehorse . Here . Okay . Bruce ? Oh , hi . Are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah , actually , I feel a lot better . - Good . - I just had to get my data back . You ate it ? Well , you know , the circumstances called for a little improvisation . Wow . Okay , so they didn 't have a great selection , but I got you some options . First thing 's first . Oh , you 're kidding me . What ? - No . - They were the stretchiest pair they had . I 'll take my chances . Rumours continue to swirl about a violent clash between forces of the US military and an unknown adversary on the campus of Culver University earlier today . Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson witnessed some of the battle . It was so big . - It was like this huge , like , hulk ! - Yeah . McGhee , who happens to be a reporter for the campus paper , captured this on his cell phone . Further search for the mysterious " hulk " was postponed by powerful thunderstorms in the Smoky Mountain National Forest . Not too short back there . I have done this before , you know . I don 't know how you 've done this on your own for all this time . With clippers , usually . - Wait , wait , wait . Wait . - What ? What ? We can 't do this . - It 's okay . I want to . - No . No . I can 't . I can 't get too excited . Not even a little excited ? It 's okay . Sir , it 's Blonsky . Has anyone found out if he has next of kin or family ? Ask him yourself . Sir ? - Good to see you back on your feet , soldier . - Thank you , sir . How do you feel ? Pissed off and ready for round three . Basically , we can 't use any of this , because they can track all of it . Well , my lip gloss ? Can they track that ? - No . You can take your lip gloss . - Thank you . - Well , I need my glasses . - Well , you can take - your glasses and your watch , okay ? - Okay . We can use most of it . We just can 't use the credit cards , the ID or the phone . - Don 't even turn that on . - Okay . And we 'll take the cash , obviously . How will we get where we need to go on $ 40 and no credit cards ? Well , we could sell this . No . No , that 's the only thing you have left from her . No . Well , we 'll have to try and get it back . Federal is already monitoring phones , plastic and Dr Ross 's web accounts , and local PD have been placed on alert . They 'll pop up somewhere and when they do , it comes straight to us . They 're not gonna just pop up . He made it five years and got across borders without making any mistakes . He 's not gonna use a damn credit card now . If he was trying to escape , he 'd be long gone . He 's not trying to escape this time . He 's looking for help and that 's how we 're gonna get him . We know what they 're after and we know he 's been talking to somebody . You all have copies of the correspondence . The aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue have been added to the SHIELD Operations Database . If he comes up for air , we 'll be waiting . If he makes a peep , we 'll hear him . And when he slips up , we 'll be ready . Hey . Smile . What is it like ? When it happens , what do you experience ? Remember those experiments we volunteered for at Harvard ? Those induced hallucinations ? It 's a lot like that , just a thousand times amplified . It 's like someone 's poured a litre of acid into my brain . - Do you remember anything ? - Just fragments . Images . There 's too much noise . I can never derive anything out of it . - But then it 's still you inside it . - No . No , it 's not . I don 't know . In the cave , I really felt like it knew me . Maybe your mind is in there , it 's just overcharged and can 't process what 's happening . I don 't want to control it . I want to get rid of it . Are you ready ? Let 's even the playing field a little . Gentlemen . Bruce , wake up . There 's something going on . We got to go . Walk toward the back . Just don 't move too fast . All right . Come . It is a long way uptown . I think the subway 's probably quickest . Me in a metal tube , deep underground , with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city in the world ? Right . Let 's get a cab . Come on , now ! Let 's go ! You 're too slow ! You drive like a woman ! - Very nice . You see her ? - Oh , my . Very pretty . Watch out , you goat ! Breathe , breathe , breathe . Are you out of your mind ? - What is wrong with you ? - What 's the matter , baby ? You don 't like a good ride ? Asshole ! You know , I know a few techniques could help you - manage that anger very effectively . - You zip it . We 're walking . Okay . Excuse me . Dr Sterns ? - Yes . - I 'm sorry to bother you . I 'm Elizabeth Ross . Oh ! Dr Ross ! - I have someone who 'd like to meet you . - Okay . It 's Mr Blue , isn 't it ? Mr Green ? I got to tell you , I 've been wondering if you were even real . And if you were , what would it look like ? A person with that much power lurking in him . Nothing could have surprised me more than this unassuming man shaking my hand . But , look . We 're not strolling into the park for a picnic , here . Even if everything goes perfectly , if we induce an episode , if we get the dosage exactly right , is that going to be a lasting cure or just some antidote to suppress that specific flare-up ? I don 't know . What I 'm saying is that if we overshoot this by even the smallest integer we 're dealing with concentrations with extraordinary levels of toxicity . - You mean it could kill him . - Kill him ? Yeah . I should say so . You should know that there 's a flip side to this , too . If we miss on the low side , if we induce me and it fails , this will be very dangerous for you . Look . I 've always been more curious than cautious , and that 's served me pretty well . So , are we going to do this ? How you feeling , man ? Like a monster . Okay . On the table . These will protect you from yourself if you have a strong reaction . You can tell me later if you thought it was strong . Oh , come on ! Stupid graduate students . Okay ... You , you , you . This will be a somewhat novel sensation . We have begun . The dialysis machine will mix the antidote with your blood . Except the antidote will only take hold once we 've achieved a full reaction . Just relax . Okay . We are comprehensive . Here you go . All right . We set to pop ? I 'd take your hands off him . Oh , my God ! Wait , wait ! There 's more ! Wait ! - Now . Okay , now ! Wait . Now , do it ! Do it ! Bruce ! Bruce , look at me . Stay with me . The antidote , now ! Sterns , do it now ! Bruce , look at me . Look in my eyes . Please , look in my eyes . Oh , you 've got to be kidding me ! Bruce . Oh , my God . Bruce ? Bruce , can you hear me ? Bruce ? It 's okay . You 're okay . You 're okay . You did it . He 's fine . This is fantastic . It 's over . Hi . Hi . That was the most extraordinary thing I have seen in my entire life ! Okay , you know what ? Stop , please . We need to go back and talk about what just happened in there . Absolutely . Okay . The gamma pulse came from the amygdala . - I think Dr Ross 's primer ... - Are you okay ? ... lets the cells absorb the energy temporarily , and then it abates . That 's why you didn 't die of radiation sickness years ago ! Now , maybe we 've neutralised those cells permanently , or maybe we just suppressed that event . I 'm inclined to think the latter , but it 's hard to know because none of our test subjects ever survived . - Of course , they weren 't getting the primer ! - Wait , wait . - Wait , what did you just say ? - They weren 't getting - the myostatin primer ... - No , no , no . Test subjects ? What test subjects ? Come with me . What 's the activity level ? - Snipers are covering Alpha sector . We started on rats and mice , but it just completely fried them , so we had to go bigger . And we still don 't know which is more toxic , the gamma or your blood . - What do you mean , my blood ? - Bruce , this is all you . You didn 't send me much to work with , so I had to concentrate it and make more . With a little more trial and error , there 's no end to what we can do ! This is potentially Olympian ! This gamma technology has limitless applications . We 'll unlock hundreds of cures . We will make humans impervious to disease ! No , no , we 've got to destroy it . - Wait , what ? - All of it . Tonight . We 're gonna incinerate it . - Is this the whole supply ? - What ... We could get the Nobel for this ! You don 't understand the power of this thing . It is too dangerous . It cannot be controlled . At your discretion , shooter . three of us ! This is Promethean fire ! It 's just ... No shot . Blonsky 's going in . Blonsky , stand down . My daughter 's in there ! We have the antidote now . They don 't want the antidote ! They want to make it a weapon ! And if we let it go , we will never get it back . You don 't know how powerful this thing is . I hate the government just as much as anyone , but you 're being a little paranoid , don 't you think ? Bruce ! Bruce ! Get out . Where is it ? Come on , where is it ? Show him to me . Blonsky ! Miss ! Take this . If you took it from me , I 'm gonna put you in a hole for the rest of your life . Betty . I will never forgive what you 've done to him . He 's a fugitive . You made him a fugitive to cover your failures and to protect your career . Don 't ever speak to me as your daughter again . It 's only because you 're my daughter that you 're not in handcuffs , too . Are you telling me you can make more like him ? No ! Not yet . I sorted out a few pieces , but it 's not like I can put together the same Humpty Dumpty , if that 's what you 're asking . He was a freak accident ! The goal is to do it better ! So Banner 's the only ... - She 's an annoying bitch . - Why are you always hitting people ? Now what possibly could I have done to deserve such aggression ? It 's not what you 've done . It 's what you 're gonna do . I want what you got out of Banner . I want that . You look like you 've got a little something in you already , don 't you ? I want more . You 've seen what he becomes , right ? I have . And it 's beautiful . Godlike . Well , I want that . I need that . Make me that . I don 't know what you 've got inside you already . The mix could be an abomination . I didn 't say I was unwilling . I just need informed consent . And you 've given it . This is what I was trying to explain . I don 't know what you 've been ladling into yourself . But clearly it worked . Let 's assume you don 't understand a word I 'm saying , but if you 'll just get back on the table , I can fix this . Shoot it ! Hey ! No ! Delta 4 to Leader . They took out two of our guys , two of our guys ! Blonsky and the Major are still inside ! Come on ! Move , move , move , move ! It 's over there ! Drop them ! What is that thing ? Shoot it ! Okay . All right ! You ... You , drive ! Let 's go ! Move , move ! Delta 4 to Leader ! Go , go , go , go , go ! Something big just went off down here ! General , you should hear this ! The Hulk is in the street ! I repeat , the Hulk is in the street ! That 's impossible . You get a hold of yourself , young man . You get it together . What is your position ? 121st Street , heading north on Broadway ! Turn us around . We 're going back . Why are we going back ? Damn it ! Give me eyes down there ! Yes , sir ! What the hell was that ? Go , go , go ! No ! One of yours ? Oh , my God . What have you done ? Fire at him , fire at him ! Do you think a rifle 's gonna hurt that ? Come on ! Sweet . Booyah ! Get out of there , soldier ! Stacy ! Give me a real fight ! Sir ? Sir ? Tell them to bring everything they 've got and head for Harlem . It has to be me . You have to take me back there . What are you saying ? You think you can control it ? No , no , not control it , but , I don 't know , maybe aim it . And what if you can 't ? We made this thing . All of us . Please . - Land us near it . - No , no . No , keep us high . Open the back door . Bruce ! Bruce , stop ! Stop ! What are you doing ? Think about this ! You don 't even know if you 'll change ! You don 't have to do this ! Please , this is insane ! Betty , I 've got to try . I 'm sorry . Oh , shit ! - Get her in here ! - Come on , miss . There . Betty ! Hulk ! Yeah ! Come on ! Is that all you 've got ? Use that thing , soldier ! Give him some help ! Which one ? Help the green one , damn it ! Which one do you think ? Cut the other one in half ! Ross ! Keep it on him ! Look , I got to put it down ! Hang on ! Dad ? Are you hurt ? Let me help you . I 'm all right . Just find a way out . You don 't deserve this power ! Now watch her die ! Look out ! General ? Any last words ? Hulk smash ! Stop ! It 's okay . Betty . Reload . Reload . The smell of stale beer and defeat . You know , I hate to say , " I told you so , " General , but that Super Soldier programme was put on ice for a reason . I 've always felt hardware was more reliable . - Stark . - General . You always wear such nice suits . Touché . - I hear you have an unusual problem . - You should talk . You should listen . What if I told you we were putting a team together ? Who 's " we " ?

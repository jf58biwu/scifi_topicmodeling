 Attention . Gentlemen I want you to make sure you 're fully loaded and ready to go . Tonight , you will encounter steep resistance . Not everyone will make it . But for the ones that do this will be a day long remembered . Long remembered , sir . And years after we 're gone history will remember the name Delta Ti Gamma . Sir , yes , sir . Delta Ti Gamma , sir . Okay , boys lock and load . Move out . Come on , let 's move out . Let 's go . Move it , move it . You going to be mice or men ? Let 's go , freshmen . Red leader , this is Blue leader . Code word is " eminent . " Green leader , this is Red leader . Civilian in sight . Radio silent . I repeat , radio silent . I have to get going . Otherwise Guy will get started without me . Okay . See you tomorrow , Kira . - Purple and Orange , I am on leader . - We don 't have Purple and Orange . - Shut up . - Make me . Operation nearly compromised , but we are a go . Repeat , we are a go . You have tried the rest , now try the best . Oh , gross . Lager or light ? - Light . - Well , then , don 't stop . Fill me up , soldier . God . Oh , God . Greg , this is so embarrassing . Fuck you , you son of a bitch . If I see those pictures on the Internet , you 're a dead man , Greg . A dead man , you hear me ? Greg , you 're such an asshole . I saved myself for you . I did not know that one of my pledges was going to do this . I promise . I promise that I am going to severely chastise him . That 's what I am going to do . Chastise him . I am in . Let me take a look at my artwork . And to think they call this a hazing . Not my best angle but it will do . I hate him . So stupid . I hate Greg . I should have known . Oh , my God . My God , are you all right , Tracy ? I can 't believe I hit you . - Are you okay ? - I think so , professor . Oh , I will be okay . Thanks . Too bad . You 're very beautiful . Sorry I have to do this to you but if all goes well , you will be up and at them in a few hours . Good , no pulse . Come on . Come on . Breathe . Oh , shit . I don 't believe it . How could it have not worked ? It should have worked . Motor functions , higher brain functions should have all been restored . This can 't be . It 's ridiculous . I changed the sequence , the base pairs . It should work . It must work . Even now , you hold the secrets of eternal life within you . And you hold onto them , keeping me alone . Alone in the dark . I will never be able to bring the dead back . My institute , all gone . Vanished . It 's all a foolish dream . I failed . I am a complete and utter failure . You can help me save the earth from the hell . Campus police , by Strug Dormitory . Dispatch units . Let 's go . Let 's move it . So , what is it that you do , exactly , Mr. Lancaster ? Come on , call me Jake , Alexandra . Okay , Jake . What is it exactly that you do ? I mean , when you 're not charming the pants off the ladies , that is . I am a doctor . A neurologist , actually . Really ? I am surprised you 're still on the market . Just haven 't found the right girl . Yet . What about you ? Your online profile doesn 't say much . And all I know now is that you are beautiful with a great personality . Phillipe , I go on break . Hey , buddy . Eat . What is your problem ? You wanted filet mignon ? Get a job . What is it , Jacques ? That son of a bitch bum bite my finger . Well , let me look at it . Keep that on it , I will be right back . The world has gone crazy , huh ? Nobody like French people . This entire mission was a waste of time . We lost a lot of good men out there . Sorry , sir . I thought we were on to something this time . You should take a look at this . It 's a new infection . Is this first generation ? Could be . Based on the reported outbreaks to date we extrapolated the point of origin . Get me Nightingale in here right away . You got it . Ellis . I am sorry about your brother . Yeah . Me too . Excuse me just a second . Getting paged . Could be the office calling . Someone needs , you know , brain work or something . Be right back . Yeah , she 's totally hot , man . Every time I go with fucking dates , they 're usually heifers . This one is a fucking babe . She 's got a great rack , too . I owe you bigtime . If I bag her tonight , I will call you in the a.m. I told her I am a fucking neurologist . She bought it hook , line and sinker . What happened to you ? You all right , Phillipe ? Little problem in the kitchen . Problem ? Nothing serious , I hope . No , just that ... The chef got bit . - Bit ? - By a homeless man . Wait . You can 't go in there . Alexandra , where you going ? What 's going on ? You can 't come back here . Jacques ? Get away from him . What was that thing ? What the hell happened to Jacques ? Hey , where you going ? Oh , I am sorry , Jake . I am going to have to take a rain check on dessert . " Bag me by breakfast " ? Yeah , I don 't think so , slick . By the way , what is it that you really do ? I am assistant manager at Blockbuster . Yeah , that would have been my second guess . Thanks for a lovely evening . That was our waiter . What 's wrong with him ? - He looks really bad . - Food poisoning . I wouldn 't recommend eating anything out of this kitchen . We already did . Nightingale . So , what do you really do for a living ? I kill zombies . So what were you doing here , Nightingale ? What do you think ? Well , if I knew that , I wouldn 't be asking , now , would I ? If you must know , I was on a date . You , on a date . I don 't believe it . How many times I ask you out , you always said no . - That 's because you 're a pig , Ellis . - I am not a pig . Tom was a pig . Was ? He was killed last week . At least I was the one to plant him . God , Ellis ... I am so sorry . I don 't know what to say . Don 't say anything . He went down fighting , both times . He liked it that way . We have all lost people we love . Won 't be the first and certainly won 't be the last . I always thought you had a thing for him . Like hell I did . - No offence . - None taken . So where are we off to ? Mobile unit , outside Sidell . Setting up for a major op . Casper will fill you in . I am just supposed to come fetch you . More Hyper sapiens ? What do you think ? We have lost contact with our forward recon patrols . But before we did , they confirmed a stage-one outbreak at a university campus . Cuesta Verde , it 's not far from here . There could be survivors . The truth is , we don 't know yet . But we do know , based on the analysis of the vectoring of the disease is that it could be our ground zero for infection . - First generation ? - Won 't know till you get us a sample . You will go in with Special Forces , find any survivors and retrieve a blood sample from the Hyper sapiens before cruise missiles destroy the entire area at 0700 . Now , as much as we 'd like to keep a lid on this , we won 't be able to for much longer . And I don 't need to tell you what will happen if 60 Minutes gets ahold of this story . We don 't need Special Forces for this op , sir . AMS can handle it alone . AMS cannot handle it alone . Says who ? - Says me , kiddo . - That 's " sir " to you , sergeant major . I am taking you and your men on this mission as a courtesy not a obligation . Get in my way , you won 't just be studying the dead , you will join them . Understood , sir ? Gentlemen , this mission is too important for dick-waving . I resent that , colonel . This is how it 's going to work . AMS will lead the science team . But you 're under the jurisdiction of Special Forces . Now , as you know , AMS is an international organization . They want this op under the strictest U.S. Operational command . These instructions came to me directly from the secretary of defence . From him , from the chief of staff . To him from the president as instructed personally by the vice president himself . As such , I expect all of you to work and play well together . Do your country proud . Yeah , sure , whatever you say , boss . Nightingale , you 're in command of the science team . Sergeant Dalton will oversee the Special Forces . You and Ellis will answer to him . Am I understood ? - Understood , sir . - Understood , sir . Sergeant Dalton ? Got you , Colonel . Nightingale ? Find the blood sample . I want those things eradicated . And why don 't you get cleaned up first . You look like shit . I am so ready to get some payback on these fuckers . What about you , Braxton ? Long as my favourite uncle 's checks don 't bounce I go where Sam sends me . All I know is , why couldn 't one of them be my ex-wife ? I mean , I would love permission to shoot her in the fucking head . Do we really need all this shit ? I mean , really ? Body armour makes my face look fat . That would be affirmative , private . What , so you have never seen a woman in her underwear before , private ? Trust me , that 's the last thing you will be thinking about come morning . Of course , this is assuming that you make it till morning . Which I got to say , ain 't looking very likely . - Leave him alone . - Whatever . Just making conversation , lieutenant . Ever get the feeling that those AMS greenhorns don 't like us very much ? Nobody likes you , Bart. How did we end up babysitting these stuck-up sons of bitches ? Hey , I will take all the backup I can get . From the GI Joes ? They 're soldiers . They 're trained for combat . Trained to fight other people . Other soldiers . Not these things . We 're trained to fight , period . And we have got you back . Just make sure you got ours and maybe we will all get to grow old one day . Or in your case , older . She digs me . Way to win friends and influence people , Ellis . I just don 't think we need them . That 's all . And I say we do . What , you got an inferiority complex now ? We started off as scientists , researchers . Not soldiers . Hey , speak for yourself . I came from Secret Service not Health and Human Resources like you . I was never a desk jockey . I was always a fighter . Not to mention a lover . This war isn 't about you , Ellis . It 's about us versus nature . If nature wins , we 're all fucked . Keep giving speeches , Nightingale . It 's what you 're good at . Pride and truth , nothing to fear but fear itself , that kind of thing . Suits you . I kind of like it . Gets me all hard and shit . You just love the sound of your own voice , don 't you ? Pretty much , yeah . Who 's the new blood ? Rodriguez . Just transferred in . Replacing Garza as our demolition expert . Well , I hope she lasts longer than he did . Because I would miss that ass . I mean , when he got scragged , it was no big loss , but her ? Now , that is a booty call that I would not mind making . You an asshole all the time , Bart ? Or do you take Sundays off for good behaviour ? Hey , welcome to the team . - I am Allison Henson . - Private Rodriguez , lieutenant . You know what ? Save " lieutenant " for parade ground . In here , just call me Allison . I am Maria . Saw you talking to those AMS guys back there . What were they saying ? Basically that we can 't hack it . What do you think ? - Can 't wait to prove them wrong . - Fuck them . When it turns into a shit-hit-the-fan situation they will be hiding behind our pantyhose just like all the rest of those fucking science types . Science types ? That 's what Bart calls people who can read . Come on , let 's roll out . Come on , come on , come on , ladies . Come on , come on . Hecht , Hill , you stay in the van in case we run an Oxy-12 set . Stay with the radio . Everyone else , move out . Come on , let 's go , let 's go . So your men as good as they think , sergeant major ? - That 's right , kiddo . - Ever fight these creatures ? They have been trained well . So they have never been in a firefight with these things . They don 't know what it 's like to look one in the eye and pull the trigger , do they ? What , are you kidding me ? My team 's been to hell and back . Bosnia , Afghanistan , Iraq . You name it , we have been there . So when a 6-year-old girl dressed in her Sunday finest you 're telling me they 're not going to hesitate ? They 're going to pull the trigger , do what needs to be done ? Like I said : Been there , done that . Now , if you don 't mind , we got work to do . I don 't like this , Nightingale . I don 't like this one bit . These gung-ho Rangers are going to get us killed or worse . What are you saying , Ellis ? Watch my back . That 's all I am saying . Are you scared ? Just rather not end up like my brother . Thought you of all people might be able to appreciate that Nightingale . I think they 're gone , don 't you ? Probably moved on . We 're not going to find any Hyper sapiens here , nope . Too late . Missed all the action . It 's too bad , because I was hoping for a medal out of this . You hard as woodpecker lips , huh ? Only medal you 're getting is a Purple Heart . And it ain 't going to be for bravery . What the hell ? Hold on a second , sergeant major . What are they doing ? DNA scanner . Analyzes their blood . I will get them plenty of blood to analyze if they need it . Third generation . Worthless . Look at this . What is it ? You ever seen teeth like that on one of them ? No , I haven 't . Neither have I. Could be they 're mutating . That 's not good , is it , Nightingale ? No . Move on out . Come on , let 's go . Not afraid of the dark , are you , newbie ? Not if you 're close . Oh , shit . What the hell is that ? Nothing , sarge , don 't worry about it . It 's just a scratch . It 's all right . It 's a bite . You have been bitten . No , it 's not . I am all right . It 's nothing . He 's been bitten . We will have to put that in a tourniquet , soldier . You have to do more than that . Medic . Nakagawa 's been injured . We need to put his arm in a tourniquet , stat . I am on it , sir . Jesus , Dalton . You can 't put a Band-Aid on infection . He 's a dead man walking , he just doesn 't know it yet . Hey , hey , hey . What do you think you 're doing , kiddo ? What do you think she 's doing ? It 's the right thing to do . We can take care of our own . Grab him . Sarge ? Sarge , what are you doing ? No , sarge , no . No , sarge , no . Stand down , soldier . - Stay still , hey . - No , no . Sorry , no choice , soldier . I told you , we take care of our own . - No . No , no , don 't . - Sorry , doc . Dalton to base . We lost Nakagawa and Braxton in a firefight with Hyper sapiens , over . Copy that , Hill out . Hill , I need you and Hecht down here to police these bodies , stat . Let 's go , ladies . Campus is right over the hill , let 's go . Get them all ? Maybe we got them all . Not fucking likely . All right , listen up . I want a full sweep of the perimeter . There could be survivors . All right , you guys , stay out of the shadows . All right ? Keep in plain sight , we 're going to be fine . Bart , you take Henson and Rodriguez to the dormitories . Gotcha . O 'Connor and Griffin , you on point with me . Ellis and Nightingale , do whatever the hell you want . Just don 't get yourselves killed . It will mean lots of paperwork , and I hate fucking paperwork . All right , come on , let 's go , guys . What is it ? Looks like a fraternity ring . Might be valuable . You 're joking , right ? Does it look like I am joking ? Hello . Well , I am sorry , darling John can 't come to the phone right now . He 's dead . Can you hear me now ? Come on , let 's go . What the hell is that smell ? They don 't all use us for bait , you know . Sometimes they use us for dinner . I can see that . All protein and no carbs . You don 't have the stomach for this , Rodriguez ? Must be something I ate . You mean more like something they ate . Come on , now . Take it like a man . Leave her alone , Bart. I can take care of myself , lieutenant . Whatever you say , private . You girls ready ? Empty . I think we took them all out . We did it , man . We did it . O 'Connor , kill that chatter . Let 's fan out . All the buildings connect through the subterranean tunnels . This entire university 's honeycomb-ville . We don 't need to lock this place down . We just need to find your Hyper sapien and get the hell out of Dodge . This certainly explains how the Hyper sapiens have been getting around . They have been following the same patterns , habits that they had while they were still alive . Except with a much bigger appetite . Clear . Clear . Man , I love books . Anton Chekhov , Feodor Dostoyevsky , Judy Blume . You know what I was reading ? Insane is the new sexy . Give it a rest , man . Hey , do you name your weapon ? You should , because it 's your best friend out here . - My weapon 's name is Sophie . Sophie Stein . - O 'Connor . O 'Connor , can it . And my side arm 's name is Tough Love . Enough , O 'Connor . I got it . Holy shit . We got a survivor . You don 't know that . Could be one of them . Hey zombies don 't read . And they ain 't hooked on phonics . So give it a rest . Hey , kid . - He 's got headphones on . - Hey , kid , can you hear me ? Come on , kid , you 're pissing me off . Careful . O 'Connor , this ain 't my first rodeo and zombies don 't read . Unbelievable . Come on , kid . Fucking zombie geek . Son of a ... Sorry about the noise . Let 's move out , form on me . Come on . Let 's go before them bombs start dropping . If I told her one time , I told her a thousand times ... - Voices . - Survivors . So , like , we had sex that one time , and after that she only wanted to be friends . I mean , she practically threw herself at me . Hello . Can you hear me in there ? Dude . It was a one-time thing . Hey , you crummy teens open the fucking door . You 're about to have sex with ... We 're coming in , stay down . Three , two , one . The problem , it sounds to me that you were a little underwhelming in the sack . Shit . Oh , man , now I get we will be joined by celebrities , Clint Howard ... God , I can 't believe this is happening . Oh , don 't go all girly on me now . Jesus Christ , it 's like you two haven 't seen a dead body before . What the hell are you doing , Bart ? Well , it seems that our unfortunate friend here was named Guy Woodhouse . I guess he won 't have to worry about finals anymore . Adios , Senor Woodhouse . Well , lookie here . I don 't want this . I am not giving it to you I just want you to take a picture . Picture of what ? Of me and my new girlfriend . Okay ? Go ahead , we 're ready . Ready for what ? Take the picture . No fucking way . Fine . I will do it . Don 't you dare . You know , I bet she was a looker when she was alive . Right ? I mean , she 's not too bad now , either . I 'd stick my dick in her but I am afraid of what would happen . You 're fucking disgusting . You don 't look fat , okay ? We really make a nice couple . Don 't you think ? Clear . O 'Connor . O 'Connor . Second generation . Close , but no cigar . - It doesn 't mean anything . - We will see . I know it 's not very scientific , but I follow my nose and my nose tells me we 're getting close . You sure you could develop a serum from this ? Well , not me . I am just a grunt like you but AMS has some pretty brilliant minds working for them . Like Nightingale here . They believe if they get DNA from a first-generation zombie generation zero , they can create an antibody . That way we can stop playing catch-up and actually end this plague once and for all . It 's not different from whooping cough or smallpox . Really , it 's just a matter of inoculating people against it . If we 're lucky , the zombie plague will end up a footnote in the history books . No worse than AIDS or bubonic plague . Yeah , if it 's all the same to you , Nightingale I 'd rather you not refer to Tom as a footnote . What 's the bug up his ass ? He lost his brother on a mission last week . Yeah , well , we all lose people . Yeah , but your people don 't usually get back up and take a bite out of you after they die . Careful , you can infect yourself . You sure as hell wouldn 't want that , would you ? No , we wouldn 't . Although if I did have to eat anyone I 'd definitely pick you , kiddo . Don 't worry , if you die I will be sure to shoot you in the head before you get to . That 's too bad . A tightass like you probably enjoy being eaten by me . Say " cheese . " Don 't you think we should continue looking for survivors , sir ? Absolutely . But first , Lieutenant Henson , don 't you want your Kodak moment with them ? That 's all right , I think I will take a pass . Well , it 's your call , but I got to tell you , I think you 'd make a mint with these things on eBay . - I am wondering about something . - What is it ? Well , it 's just that if these two were locked up in here and there 's no sign of forced entry how 'd she get infected ? That 's a good question . And my answer to that is , " Who gives a fuck . " But if she didn 't have contact with another person , my worry is could the infection have gone airborne ? AMS said there 's no sign of this infection being spread airborne . AMS has their heads up their asses , okay ? That 's why we do their dirty work for them . If they knew what they were doing , they would have invented a vaccine by now and they would have had a full containment unit on this thing . I am just saying ... - What is it ? - It 's ... It 's nothing . It 's just a mosquito bite , I think . No way . Oh , shit . Sarge , I think I heard something . Keep moving , soldier . Sarge , somebody 's up there . Stow that shit and keep moving . Sarge , somebody 's up there . Shit . Hey . Hey , wait up . Hey , wait . Hello ? Hello ? I know you 're in here . You don 't have to be afraid . I am coming to get you out . It 's going to be all right . Okay . I am going to get you right out of here . It 's going to be okay . I am going to get you home . You will be all right . It 's going to be all over . Oh , God ... What are we going to do ? We can 't just leave him here . We can 't take him with us . You got to take me to base camp . He could turn at any time . Maybe they found the zero sample . You know , maybe they can ... What ? Do what ? Cure you ? - You know that 's not going to happen . - Maybe it can 't be transmitted by mosquitoes . Maybe it was something else . Maybe they were already infected before they came into the room . Can 't take that chance , Bart. Here . What 's this for ? You know what it 's for . Use it soon as you start to feel the change coming . What , are you insane ? I am not going to fucking kill myself . Then I will do it for you . Put the gun down . You got to take me with you . You can 't leave me here . Listen , Bart you 're endangering our entire mission . We 're wasting time . I will give you each a half a million dollars if you take me with you . That 's $ 500,000 apiece . What do you say , Rodriguez ? Pretty young thing like you . You don 't want to live your whole life on the crap that Uncle Sam doles out to grunts like us , do you ? Five hundred thousand bucks can buy a lot of shit . You could be living it up Robin Leach-style . Where you going to get that kind of money ? Pharmaceutical company . If we get the zero matter to them , before AMS they 're going to pay us millions . I mean , can you imagine what the patent on this drug is going to be worth ? How much Goldman is going to be willing to pay ? Now , Dalton is in it with me , and you two can be in it with us too . There 's going to be enough to go around for everybody . Private , what the hell are you doing ? - You can 't be serious . - Hell , yeah . Have you looked at your paycheque lately ? Sounds like a good deal to me . Never underestimate the power of human greed Lieutenant Henson . You didn 't think I 'd sell out our country for this piece of shit , did you ? Should have known better . Now , what are we going to do with him , ma 'am ? We 're going to let him rot here with the rest of them . Where 's Griffin ? He was right behind us . Was . Not anymore . Man , I told him to keep up . Got to move ... Shit . Jesus . Look at this . They must have lured the zombies into the cage and got bitten in the process . Shot themselves before they turned . Smart . They can smell us . This cage isn 't going to hold them forever . We should get the hell out of here . Remember , I give the orders . Go ahead . Order away . This cage ain 't going to hold them forever . Let 's move out of here . Let 's get moving . Come on . Ugly son of a bitch . Sergeant major , get down . I am okay , I am okay . - No , you 're not . You 're infected . - I am okay , I am okay . He 's turning . No , I am not turning , I am fine . Stand back . O 'Connor . - Stay back , sarge . - Stand down . I don 't want to do this . Oh , God they got the sarge , man . Not the sarge . They got the sarge ... Don 't know why I am even bothering with the gun . It 's not like he actually has the balls to use it . Sure you don 't want a picture with him ? If they can get the sarge , they can get anybody . Man was the best soldier I have ever seen . All right , we got to get the fuck out of here . Let 's move . Damn . We got to go back . Right . I don 't want to be one of them , man . We got to bug out . Hey , we got the guns , they don 't . Ellis ? Look sharp . Reload . So that 's why they 're evolving . To chew through our armour . - What do we do ? - Only thing we can do : Run like hell . Can 't go back that way . We will have to go around . Base , this is Ellis , over . Base , this is Ellis , over . We need extraction , over . Guess we 're on our own . This is not good . No , it 's not . I have an idea . There is a part two to this plan , right ? Stay off the floor . Not bad . Don 't ask me to do it again . I will go get the radio . Warn base about Dalton and Bart. Hecht , you okay ? They came from out of nowhere . So fast . They destroyed the radio . They 're so fast . So fast . Don 't open the door . Have you been bitten ? Shit . I will wait . Don 't wait . Much better . Yeah . But I can 't see your nipples now . You really are a pig , aren 't you , Ellis ? Well , maybe a little bit . Hey , can I ask you something ? If it 's not too personal or anything . Yeah , sure . What is it ? Why do they call you " Nightingale " ? It 's a long story . Ah , come on . Not likely I will make it to the big finish anyhow and ... .. ... . it 's just always kind of bugged me . " I get it . " Goody two-shoes , always helping people in need . Real Florence Nightingale type . All right . You ready ? Couple of years ago , I was in the Peace Corps . Right out of med school . Working in Africa . Small village , good people . One day everybody started getting sick . Wasn 't AIDS or anything . Wasn 't like anything we 'd ever seen before . Blood coming out of every orifice . We set up a medevac . Tended to the dead and dying as best we could . I didn 't eat , didn 't even sleep , 24 / 7 . Team from NSA came in . Wanted us to try a vaccine they created . At that point , I would have done anything to stop their suffering . It did . Then they woke up . They weren 't alive . They were dead , but they were still walking . So I only had one choice . I grabbed a machine gun and I started firing . Must have killed a hundred of them , maybe more . I lost count after a while . I killed them all . They were all dead . The men , the women , children . Want to know why they call me Nightingale ? That 's when it started . As a sick joke . It stuck ever since . Okay , then . What do you say we get the hell out of here ? Yeah , let 's . All right . Map said this was the oldest building on the campus . GPS says it 's the science building . Sounds like a good place to start . All right . Where the hell are we ? My last mag . - This must be the science lab . - Yeah , you think ? You don 't think these things have learned to shoot , do you ? No , I sure as hell don 't . Hold your fire . We 're a medical-research team . We 're here to help . Okay , right . Well , unless they have learned to talk too , I think we 're in luck . Alex , you 're bleeding . We don 't have time for this . I am Dr. Alexandra Morgan , AMS . This is Lieutenant Ellis . Lonny , Lonny Evans . This is my girlfriend , Sarah . Yeah , where 'd you get the firepower , kids ? Campus cop . He ... He gave it to us right before he , you know , bought the farm . How long you guys been down here ? I don 't know . Couple days , maybe ? Like a week . We have been living off these chocolate PowerBars since it started . Since what started ? Everything . Those things , are they still out there ? I am afraid they are . Where are we , exactly ? It 's ... It 's one of the university research labs . Lonny and I were teaching assistants for Professor Curien when it all went down . When what went down ? They don 't know . The infection . This is where it all started . The first zombie was created here . How ? He created a DNA sequencer that scanned the human genome and it genetically reassembled the chromosomes in a person 's molecular makeup in order to create mitosis ... Whoa , whoa , sweetie . You 're going a little over my head . The professor was trying to bring back the dead . They found out he was stealing corpses for his experiments from the hospital morgue . When they stopped that , he ... He just continued with his experiments . Okay . But where did the sequencer come from ? Her . The professor 's son , Rudy , and his girlfriend came back here a few months ago , but she was different somehow . Changed . She killed his son , but Curien kept her chained up here convinced her blood held the key to eternal life . Personally , I just thought he was a pervert . Where 's Rudy , professor ? Doctor Curien , please , you have to help me . So that 's it . Generation zero . The first Hyper sapien . Of course . The Isla del Muerte incident . They were both taken into custody by AMS but showed no signs of infection , so they were released . Now , who are you people , and where the hell is Rudy ? Let me see if I have this right . There was a crazy German priest . - Spanish . - Spanish priest . He impaled you through the heart , killing you . And your boyfriend Rudy brought you back to life with an immortality serum . That 's the stupidest thing I have ever heard . Why don 't you tell me what really happened . I don 't get it , man . What 's the big deal ? The big deal is , if we can get a sample of her blood we might just be able to synthesize an antidote for the infection . I can open the door . You get it ? - Yep . - Sweetheart I could kiss you right now . Time for tongue acrobatics later . Right now , we got what we came for . Let 's get out of here . Oh , shit . Sarah , behind you . Sometimes a mind isn 't a terrible thing to waste . The missiles are on their way , Ellis . How the fuck are we going to get out of here ? We 're trapped . We better figure out something , or this is going to become our permanent residence in about 14 minutes and 20 seconds . Help . Help me . Please . - I am almost out . - Me too . - We did not come this far to fail now . - Drop dead . Ellis , take the vial . There . Grab this . Hold on . I see the van . Come on . - No . - God . We have to go back . What are you , crazy ? Why ? We had a zero sample , but I lost it . Cruise missiles are going to level this entire area in less than 10 minutes . We don 't have time . Even if we did , there 's too many of them . I don 't care . We have to try . I can 't allow it . And with the rest of the team dead , I am sorry . I am in charge . Well , I am not leaving without what we came here for . Are you absolutely sure that 's the right material you had ? We 're sure . If our radio hadn 't been destroyed , we would be able to call off the air strike but we have lost all communication with HQ . Look , every minute we waste talking about it is a minute we lose . If we 're going to go back , we go now . Back , back into the lab we get the zero sample , and that way , all of this hasn 't been for nothing . Let me ask you a question , lieutenant . You got a brother ? All right , boys and girls . It 's the fourth quarter . Down by 21 and the clock is ticking . Okay , Knute Rockne . Guys ? Fuck . On me . Let 's go . We got to move . Well , we found the gym . Nice shooting , lieutenant . Don 't tell me we made a wrong turn . I am making this up as I go along , Alex . If you have got a better idea , I am all ears . Door 's not going to hold forever , guys . Not to mention we 're running out of time . Look at this . We can 't open the grate from this side . What do we do ? We improvise . I bet it 'd be easier to open that grate from the other side . I am sure you could . But getting to the other side is the real trick , now , isn 't it ? Here 's what I suggest . We go out that door , down around the stairs to the right up to the hallway . That should take me to the corridor leading to the science building which should theoretically put me right outside that grate . Are you crazy ? What about all the Hyper sapiens out there ? I have got an idea about that too . Give me your knife . It 's like the gels we used to use to train attack dogs . They will think I am one of them . That way I will go up and open the grate . Are you crazy ? Yeah , he 's crazy , all right . What are you doing ? I can 't take any weapons . They smell gunpowder . Just because it 's your turn to have an idea doesn 't mean you can 't wait for a good one . Keep it . It 's your lucky knife . I know . Just make sure you bring it back . Okay , Steven ? What the fuck was I thinking ? Dumbest move I ever saw anybody make . Hell of a soldier . Not too hard on the eyes , either . Hope he makes it back OK . I wouldn 't mind asking him out . That is , unless you ... .. This door 's going to give , Alex . In a few minutes , we 're going to have some very unwelcome guests for supper . If you 're going to do this , Ellis , you better do it now . That 's good . Where the hell 's Ellis ? Ellis ain 't coming . Don 't be so sure . Short , controlled bursts . Conserve your ammo . You will need it . Alex , Henson , get your asses out here . Alex , come on . Alex . Come on . Shit . The lab 's just around the corner . We can still make it . Alex . Get the damn sample . How much time do we have left till the missiles hit ? Minutes . Maybe less . Here . Got it . Let 's go . Come on , Henson . We will carry you the rest of the way . I am not going anywhere , you know that . - Maybe we can ... - What ? Reverse the disease ? Come on . I know it 's over . Just do me a favour and get that blood to people who can do some good with it , okay ? Make sure no one else has to end up like me . Make me that promise . Yeah , of course . You- - You got to move . Come on , I got like a minute of life left . You think I want to spend it looking at your ugly mugs ? Hey , Ellis . Yeah , Henson . I got a sister . I will see you around , soldier . No . You won 't . There 's no time to go back . One last stand ? Why not . Alex . Alex . Get the hell out of here . That 's an order . Whoa , hold your fire . Where 's the rest of the team ? I am the rest of the team . I am not infected . Things didn 't go as well as planned , but I got a sample . Are you serious ? Yeah . Give it to me . Why ? I said , give it to me . What 's wrong with you , lieutenant ? What 's wrong with me ? You know what it 's like to cut off your own hand ? Watching the tendons snap the marrow of the bone the pain . The horrible , excruciating agony . And the blood , wow . Watching it pump out of your body and pour across the floor . Wondering when it will be that you will lose consciousness and if you will ever wake up again . But I knew I had to do something , you know otherwise I 'd end up dead . Dead like them . You were bit . By a mosquito . Not enough blood for it to happen as quickly as by a human bite . But , you know , it would have happened eventually if I hadn 't done something . Listen , Bart. There are more missiles coming . It 's okay . You just give me the sample . I have called base . I have taken care of the missiles . Listen , give me the sample . Slowly . Slowly . All right , soldier . Now , let 's get you and that sample back to AMS and see if we can 't get you some help . Sorry , Charlie . I know you went to hell and back to get this but I can 't let you get in my way . There is millions of dollars at stake for me . Millions of dollars ? Bart , there are millions , maybe billions of lives at stake here . You and I are going to take that sample and we 're going to head back to AMS and we 're going to do it now . I don 't think so . Fuck . Didn 't want you hogging all the glory for yourself . Hey . We got to get out of here . Now . Grenade . Is it all right ? Ellis , the blood sample . Is it intact ? Can we go back ? It 's over . It 's over . Let 's get out of here . Another victim . It looks like they 're spreading . They didn 't get a piece of you , did they ? Before the missile strike ? I don 't know . You know what to do if it turns out the answer is yes , right ? We don 't know , do we ? No . So we wait . And see . You should just shoot me now . You shouldn 't take the chance . Get in . If I don 't get a chance to ... To say ... Yeah . I know . So you think the blast contained it ? Stopped the infection ? " No . " So it 's just going to go on and on . Maybe . We will just have to wait and see . Yeah . Let 's just do that . The city has been overrun . Attempts to stop the undead have been ineffective . The vice president has ordered a quarantine of the city from his undisclosed location as attempts continue to stem the spread of the disease . We hope to have more details as they develop .

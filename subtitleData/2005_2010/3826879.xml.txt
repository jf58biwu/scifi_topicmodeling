 Previously on Defying Gravity . Five other focused signals ... have communicated with the Beta object ... over the years . The Gamma object is on Venus . I 'm gonna hazard a guess it 's gonna be ourjob to pick these things up . That is the primary goal of the Antares mission . The crew 's physiology 's changing , lining up like points on a grid . We could be looking at serious medical problems down the line . What 's gonna happen when they pick up Gamma ? We have to tell them . Is that your hallucination ? If the objects are keying on our guilt or shame , then you have to pursue it . You 're just questioning my faith because you have none of your own . - Paula , we 're not finished here . - Yes , we are . There 's a huge amount of public funding in this project . I think the public has a right to be kept informed . Don 't you ? - She 's in a coma . - Oh , my God . Keep this to yourself . This never happened . I may not have killed her , but she 'll probably never walk again . But nothing ever happened ! Did it , Mike ? You 're back on the floor starting tomorrow . I think that 's the first time we 've slept together without screwing . - Probably . - Mmm . It was nice , Donner . Thank you . I needed it . I should probably get up now . - Yes . Today 's the day . - Yeah . - Today 's the day . - Yeah . Today 's the day . - Go ahead . You first . - Oh , no . Please . You look like you have a need . All right . - Nadia give you a send-off ? - Beg pardon ? Did Nadia give you a send-off ? One last hurrah before you incinerate on an alien planet . - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - Oh . Well , you should know that a nearly-naked hallucination ... Just ran from your bay into Nadia 's . Okay . We didn 't ha - It 's not what you think . Doesn 't matter , Donner . Really . Today it doesn 't matter . There are a handful of days in everyone 's life ... that they can point to and say , " That day changed me . That day helped make me who I am . ' " They usually happen on big event days - day you get married , have your first kid ... the day you land on Venus . But they can also happen on regular days ... in unlikely moments ... with events that may seem like nothing at the time . Or they 're so huge ... that they literally take your breath away . So , are we just gonna lie here , or ... are you going to screw me again ? Mmm ? Oh , God , woman , it feels like it 's gonna fall off now . Then don 't waste my time teasing . What 's the big rush ? You know damn well what the rush is . You 're gonna make the cut . Of course I 'm gonna make the cut . I wanna know if I 'm ranked first . - Who 's on the cusp ? - Spence , Dereux and Barnes . We can 't add one more ? Costs $ 5 million to train a candidate . " One more " isn 't in the budget . You want Wassenfelder , you have to deal . I was 28th last time - 28th ! Eight places below the line . You 've been doing great . They are not going to ax you . Yeah , says the woman who last time was ranked 12th . Might as well call my mother , start packing . There 's that open teaching job at the university . Would you stop talking like that ? Okay , they know how much this means to you . Yeah . They know how much this means to all of us . Probably look at me as damaged goods . Yeah , or as someone who really sacrificed . That 's not the way it works . You know it , I know it . Only thing holding me together is the eagle . - Eagle ? - Yeah . This morning , first thing I saw when I woke up was an eagle . - Good omen . - Well , then that 's different . You 're a shoo-in . Yeah . - Hey . - Hey . You missed Form . I don 't think there 's anything for me to do . Anything that they trust me with . Kinda how I feel - generally . It is ... brutal . Yeah . So , you know what they did ? They put us both on your classroom in space thing . I 'm , like , your new cameraman . Do you believe in miracles , Steven ? I believe that amazing stuff goes on in the universe every single day ... but that they all have an explanation . Miracles are ... reality with parts missing . - So they 're lies . - No , they 're incomplete . It 's like we smooth over the missing stuff with what we want to believe . It 's just that ... Mintz wants me to examine every moment ... of my miracle with Hector . So ? Who 's to say that examining every moment is gonna make it any less of a miracle ? I mean , the most religious people I know are physicists . The explanation is what makes them believe in a higher power . This could be the most important day of all of our careers . Not only do we have a huge task at hand ... but we have to manage and control every bit of information that leaves this building . - Then why all the press ? - Because this is history . It 's essential that the public and press witness the landing . Now many of you are gonna be called upon for interviews . I remind you , keep the subject on Venus . Obviously , we don 't want anyone to see the Gamma object . So with that in mind , we 've been working on a 50-50 plan - 50 % live feed , 50 % prerecorded . The video is from a training we did in Arizona . And I guess they got some movie effects people to make it look like Venus . Basically , what it 's gonna be is Zoe leaving the lander ... walking around , picking up some rocks and getting back in . I knew the moon landing was a hoax . It 's like a bad conspiracy movie . This isn 't why I signed up . Look , it 's been difficult for all of us to take this in . - You don 't seem to have a problem . - It 's because I 'm Hindu . I see this as our human destiny . But imagine the general public with this information . It would be a disaster . You can 't want that . What I want doesn 't matter . We don 't have a choice . I 'm kinda worried about Zoe . We don 't know what these things are ... we don 't know what they do , we don 't know what they want . No , we don 't , and it 's a bitch , and it 's scary and it 's unfair , but we do the best we can . You 're not up here . Believe me , it 's scary down here too . I somehow doubt that . So I 've ... lost you . I can 't lose Zoe too . You have not lost me . Well , for the next six years . For the next six years I will be as close to you as this damn comm will allow me to be . And I need you as much as you need me ... so do not ever say that you 've lost me . I really should get going . Kinda got a big day ahead of us . Yeah . Thought I might find you here . " Woman alights on the breast of Venus . " Beauty that burns bright and hot ... and has never felt the touch of man . " Poetic . - And slightly Sapphoerotic . - Yeah . Better than " One small step . " Or Walker 's " The red planet conquered . " - Men . - Men . Rollie 's acting weird , needy . Donner slept with Nadia last night . You win . And I 'm oddly untroubled by it . Warrior 's last screw . Oh , or not . Uh , no . Um , not meant that way . That ... didn 't come out right . Truly . I would die if I lost you . You 're not gonna lose me . It 's as if I 'm wearing a suit of armor today . Nothing can touch me . Not Venus . Not Donner . Not Beta . Think I 'm gonna be able to see this new one ? There 's only one way we 're ever gonna find out . The last three months you have been poked , prodded and tested in a thousand ways . Now 20 of you will move on . Ten of you will accept our sincere thanks ... and go home tomorrow . For those of you who make the cut , congratulations . Finish your day and enjoy your weekend ... because on Monday it all gets a lot tougher . For those of you who don 't ... know that you were exceptional just to be considered . I 'd be happy to write personal recommendations for any of you . You leave with my deepest respect ... and gratitude . - Congratulations ! - Yes ! Yes ! First again . Congratulations ! You deserve it ! No , you deserve it ! - Zoe - - Has gotta go . I 'm so sorry . Venus is a terrible place for human beings . Its surface pressure is 93 times that of Earth ... and temperature on a nice day is 460 degrees Centigrade . In fact , it 's been only in the last 10 years ... that technology has advanced to a point where human landing is possible . And even with those advances ... time on the planet is limited to 20 minutes ... after which everything will simply break down . El planeta Venus es un planeta - - You guys get any rest last night ? - One of us did , yes . - Why you gotta go there ? - It 's gonna be hot on the surface . - I need you both to push fluids . - That 's amazing . - That is exactly what Donner was doing last night . - Hey . ... que hemos avanzado lo suficiente para que un aterrizaje en Venus sea posible . Thermal cooling system ? Know what really bothers me about you , Nadia ? You have no consideration for anyone but yourself . T.C. S ? I mean , what was going through your head last night , sleeping with Donner ? Did it ever occur to you that maybe that wouldn 't be the best thing for Zoe to wake up to ... and it might be a good idea for her to keep her mind on other things ? - And we didn 't screw . - What ? We slept together , but we didn 't screw . You 're telling me you and Donner spent the night in each other 's arms and nothing happened . Yes . Sometimes it feels good just to be held . How much do you know about what happened the other night ? Most of it . No one else on the floor knows anything . The girl I hit . You know her name ? Rollie ... as impossible as this might seem to you , you have to let it go . I feel like a coward . But what we 're doing here is beyond that guilt . It 's beyond our personal lives . It 's beyond our friends and family . Do you understand ? It 's beyond everything . If Zoe doesn 't make it , what does that mean ? It 'll probably mean my marriage is over . I 've played the trust card one too many times . It 'll probably mean the mission is over as well . And I have a feeling somehow that the fate of mankind is mixed up in all of this . You two are both in the astronaut program . Would you like to be taking that walk on Venus today ? I didn 't join the program to be sitting behind a desk . We would very much like both to be on Venus today . It 's an extraordinarily hostile place to take a walk , isn 't it ? I mean , is this a place that we could settle ? We can 't last for more than 20 minutes on the surface . The clouds are sulfuric acid . - Or mine ? - Well , that 's impractical . And the surface elements are very similar to Earth , so there 'd really be no point . So may I ask the obvious question then - Why are we spending all of this money and risking two human lives ? Because it 's an amazing achievement . To plant a flag ? Oh , come on . You two have personally made terrific sacrifices for this mission . That can 't be your answer . Arnel ? Well , we have a landing to make . Ladies and gentlemen , if I could ... I 'd like to ask you to move to the press room now , please . They both look good , Ev . Strange , though . Zoe 's heart rate is close to 60 . - Strong and calm . - Yeah . Maybe a little too strong and calm . You know something I don 't ? Doctor ? There 's some weird physiological changes happening to you guys ... that I 'm not supposed to talk about . I 'm gonna send you what I have in a personal file . Roger that . In the meantime ? They 're good to go . Zoe . This day will pass . You may always regret it ... but you need to remember it as the day you had the strength to move on . And that is all I 've got . That is all the shrink wisdom I have . - Good luck . - Thanks . Yeah . It was one of those days for me . And I 've got the scar . It 's kind of like a road marker , you know ? A point to move away from ... to rise above . Okay , people , everybody on the track in two minutes . - I 'll see ya . - Yeah . Thank you . Gotta get goin ' . Scram ! I 'll see you tomorrow . - See you tomorrow . - Bye . You get to keep that . Oh , and your bucket . Definitely keep your bucket . I know you probably don 't think you want it , but you 'll wish you had it later . Yeah . It 's pretty impressive , you just let it get away from you the once . Yeah . You should probably go . You know , for what it 's worth , I think they 're making a big mistake . - Don 't tell me that . - Well , that 's the truth . Yeah . Well - Not gonna be the same around here without you . - All right . - All right . - Just ... take care . - Okay . Donner . Yeah ? What are you doing tonight ? Uh , nothing special . - Major Tom 's ? - Yeah . Nadia wants to celebrate and everything . Nice . Of course . Well , if you get bored or something ... I 'm not an astronaut anymore . To Zoe ! Her destiny is elsewhere ... But she 'll always be in our thoughts . To Zoe , who was , is and will always be out of your league . Thanks , Wass . To number one ! May you always ride on top of the pole ! On top of the pole ! - He 's being lewd , Nadia . - Who cares ? I 'm number one ! More ! More ! Okay , we 're gonna need another round of the same . It 's on me , on my tab . - I 'm gonna need help tomorrow with Zoe . Donner , Ted , you in ? - Yeah . - Do you know anybody with a truck ? - I got a truck . - That thing ? Does that still run ? - Of course it still runs ! You know , you 're a misogynist ... and a hopeless jerk . - Did you know that ? - Hopeless jerk , maybe . You have no right to tell a woman she can 't experience ... the pain and suffering of having a relationship with a screwed-up man . - Seriously screwed-up man . - With scars on his back . - Who drinks to forget . - I 'll take my chances . Caveat emptor is all I 'm saying . And I 'll never say you didn 't warn me . You realize this can only lead to trouble . Bring it on . If you don 't want to be here , don 't be here . You 're no fun tonight , Donner . I 'll see you tomorrow . I keep putting on fresh makeup , but I can 't seem to stop crying . # Thought I saw a spark # # From a distant fire # # Didn 't know what my own heart desired # # There must be something better # # Than to curse the dark # # ' Cause then she answered the call # # From my # # Unknowing heart # # My angel # # Of the night # # Has brought me to # # The light # # She has come to # # She has come # # To light # # For me # I wish it weren 't Donner . - # For me # # - It was always Donner . Zoe and Donner . What the hell do these things want from us ? I don 't know , but they 're changing you physically to do it . Extension of what happened to Ajay and Rollie ? Only at a genetic level . - And it 's happening to all of us ? - Including Eve . How could they keep this from us ? From me ? I 'm sorry , Ev . Not my choice . And they will hang me if they find out I told you . - Understood . - We should check the crew 's genomes every week . - You 'll be more secure doing it up there as part of the routine . - Yeah . You realize this can only lead to trouble . Bring it on . What are you looking at ? That eagle . Oh , yeah . It 's a good omen . He was there yesterday too . Well ... doesn 't mean he 's bad . Maybe he 's trying to tell you about a new opportunity . Maybe he wants you to stay . You really think I 'd cut it ... as an astronaut 's girl and support ? - I didn 't say support . - Watching you guys go to work every day . Resenting every single mission ... not for you but because I couldn 't be there too . Just hanging out at Major Tom 's and listening to all your stories . I want my life to be my life . My successes . My failures . My choices . I can 't live around my dream without being a part of it . Good-bye , Maddux Donner . We are T-minus one hour to entry burn . Roger that . The suit is fully pressurized . All systems nominal . I 'm being positioned in the stand . You 're in . So , did you figure out what you 're gonna say ? Yeah . I 'm thinking , uh , " I just peed in my pants . " - Memorable . - Always go with the truth . Hey . I 'll be back in a couple ofhours . Can you bring me back one I can see ? I took it off the flight deck . - I figured you 'd need it more down here . - Thanks , Paula . God bless you . I wish I was going with you . You good ? Right where I wanna be . You ? Hell , yeah . All right , guys , let 's burn some fuel . Crossbow , you are a go to start lander separation . Cuttin ' ' er loose . Internal power and distribution bus . Power 's nominal . A.P.U. ' s are nominal . Propulsion systems ? Propellant is pressurized . All systems showing green . Guidance set to entry and landing . G.N.C. Set to tertiary . Okay , last load . Do all geologists ... carry their rocks along with them ? And pickaxes and surprisingly heavy shovels . We are pack rats , yes . Although I was planning on staying a little longer . I 'm sorry . - What time 's your train ? - 6 : 00 . She wants to get there early though . It 's not even noon yet . Maybe we could grab lunch or just a cool drink . Yeah , sh - she kinda wants to get out , Ajay . Right . Of course . I guess Donner and Ted are a no-show . Yeah , Ted 's not picking up his phone . Shocker . And , uh , Donner couldn 't stay . Sorry . That 's okay . I don 't mind . So , you gonna tell me how it went ? Nah . You didn 't tell him anything , did you ? That 'll be the last thing I do . This one 'll be the real images ... and this 'll be the cover recordings of Zoe picking up the rocks . - All you have to do - - Is lie . You do understand why we need to do this . Till we find out what they are , the world isn 't ready for the truth . So we smooth it over a little . That 's right . Sure . I can do that for 10 minutes . Do you mind if we say a prayer first ? I 'm not religious , but I 'm a praying fool on the tarmac . Just a cover-my-bases deal . - Zoe and Donner , you good with a prayer ? - Go for it , Paula . I 'll take any help we can get . Lord , please protect our friends and colleagues ... Zoe and Donner ... on this difficult task . If we 're facing evil , protect us . If we 're facing you , protect us . All we are seeking is the truth . - And in your name we serve . Amen . - Amen . - Amen . - Amen . Amen . - Donner ? - What ? I said " amen . " How 's it look outside ? Looks really kinda awesome . It 's giving me butterflies . Seen any eagles out there ? Yeah . Yeah . Right above the clouds . Great big one . Big ol 'wingspan . Nice . This is one of those days . Yes , it is . Wanna leave some of that bag for me ? I thought you and Jen are helping Zoe move . - I thought you had that covered . - No . She kicked me out . When ? Last night ? This morning . So why you hittin ' that bag like that ? - I always hit this bag . - No , you don 't . Not like that . - You asked him to leave ? - Yeah . And he left . Man , you give a man an out and he will run . No , I - I wanted him to run . Well , Maddux Donner , Mr. I 've Had a Vasectomy , tragic American hero ... is nothing but trouble for you . I 'd be miserable with him . Not being in the program , what would I do here ? So , why did you sleep with him ? Because I , uh - I wanted to say good-bye . Hell of a way to say good-bye . Yeah , but I did it . I did it . I said good-bye . As soon as I saw that eagle , I knew . Oh , the omen eagle ? This morning again . I 'm lying there in his arms ... and there 's the eagle , right outside the window ... just telling me to take flight and move on . - You 're not doing this because of a bird , are you ? - No , I 'm not - It 's a sign . This is a turning point , like Mintz said . So there is before-eagle , and there is after-eagle ... and I am now , you know , post-eagle . Okay . Your rocks are all packed . Thank you . So , it looks like we have about five hours . Yeah , and you 're not spending ' em alone . Excuse me . Where did you have those done ? Crossbow , you are clear for entry burn . Antares , you have the comm . We are T-minus one minute to entry burn . - Roger that . - Copy . Antares , give me burn initiation sequence on my mark . Initiation sequence ready . And ... mark . 9 - 6-0-2-0-3-0 . Niner-6-0-2-0-3-0 . Forty seconds to burn . - You ready ? - Yeah . Forty seconds . Standing by . Venus 's atmosphere is extremely dense . This makes entry all the more critical ... and communication with the ship impossible . For the next eight minutes ... Crossbow will be out of touch . It is as close as we humanly can come to a descent into hell . - Twenty seconds . - Roger that . Twenty . Attitude rate scale at five . Donner , if anything happens , I w - - Ten seconds . Nine , eight ... - We 're gonna grease this , Zoe . Seven , six , five ... four , three ... two , one . Here we go . Godspeed , Crossbow . See you on the other side . Seven-minute mark . Seven minutes . Should be soon . Shield separation in one minute . Zoe , what 's your status ? All nominal . Antares , this is Crossbow . Do you co - Antares - Antares , this is Crossbow . Go . We 're in . This is Antares , Crossbow . Glad you made it through . You and me both . That was shake-and-bake all the way . Smells like chicken dinner from here . Any shield damage ? Uh , negative . Negative . We got all systems in the green . And shield separation in three , two , one - Shield is free . - FI DO , do we have a position on them ? - Coming in now . Flight , they 've been blown out of the cone . - How far ? - Two degrees south . Donner , we have you two degrees off E.D.L. Flight path . Copy that . Yeah , affirmative . We 're getting a push up here from some wind . I 'm gonna go to manual , try to correct . - Paula , give me a fuel rate countdown . Watch the tanks . - Roger that . What happens if they miss ? Well , Zoe can 't walk more than a hundred meters and make it back alive . So if we miss , we 're collecting some rocks and aborting . Donner , you 're gonna get me close , right ? Yeah . We shouldn 't see this much wind down at the surface . This bus is going right to your front door . Arnel . Sweet , huh ? Should have seen the box they had me in . Think they give all the best apartments to the girls ? This is gonna be my marker . The day I moved on . This one . That 's a big tat . I can downsize it . This size is okay . - Where ? - Back of my left shoulder . You wanna book an appointment ? We should do this in a couple sessions . We do it today , all at once . Donner , you are still two degrees off flight path . It 's all I can do to keep that . We 're burning through some fuel down here . One hundred meters . Descending at seven per second . Donner , fuel 's at five percent . Forty seconds to auto abort . Seventy meters . Down at seven , drifting at five . They 're five degrees out . Come on . Oh , come on . This wind 's gotta die soon . Sixty meters . Down at seven , drift at five . - Twenty seconds to touchdown . - Flight , he 's going to miss . Donner , you have got to get it close . He 's almost at auto abort . He can 't burn any more fuel . Donner , don 't fight it . Just bring it down . Twenty meters . Down at five . Zero , ten seconds . Auto abort sequence initiated . - No ! We 're almost down ! - Auto abort sequence initiated . Negative . Canceling abort . I 'm settin ' ' er down . Down at two . Five , four , three , two , one . Contact . And we 're down . That 's what I got . Antares , Crossbow has landed . Venus Base is secure . - Copy that , Venus Base . - How far from the object ? How close are we , Donner ? From the object , we are - 286 meters . Two hundred eighty-six meters . That 's too far . We can 't get it from here . Uh , Mission Control , we copy . 286 meters from the object . So much for destiny . I guess ... it just doesn 't want us to pick it up . Maybe it 's better this way . So that 's it ? There 's a crosswind , you know . You can only fight that so much in a dense atmosphere . You never know how you 're gonna react to those life-changing moments . There was a guy in Stockton , California who won 50 million in the lottery ... and then drove himself off a cliff . Some people react badly , no matter what the news . What do they want us to do ? Control , what do you want us to do ? Others let it roll off their backs and move on . We got 20 minutes to get off that planet . Let 's pick up some rocks , put on a show for the folks back home ... get the hell out ... and figure out our next step once we get them back on the ship . Let 's put on a good face , people . Zoe is now emerging from the lander . She 's being lowered by the same stand that supported her during the descent . I am ... descending to Venus . All is nominal . The atmosphere is incredibly thick . There is lightning to the right . She 's down . Mark the day with a footprint . A step forward in the path of man . That was really nice , Zoe . How 's the suit ? All nominal . Stepping away from the ship . The fact is that , good or bad ... those days that change our lives don 't go away . You put a marker in the road , and you move on ... and hope that the next life-changing moment will go your way . Excuse me . Somebody said they saw you talking to a blonde woman with a couple of friends . Pressure is making the suit creak . It 's amazing . Are you getting that , Donner ? Yeah . Video 's coming in crystal clear . No . That . The baby . Baby ? I 'm sorry , Zoe . Can you repeat that last ? - Oh , Zoe . - Did she just say " baby " ? It 's her hallucination that 's talking to her . - She 's changing direction . - I don 't hear anything . Turn around and come back to the lander , Zoe . She 's going towards it . She 's going towards Gamma . Zoe , come in . Do you copy ? Come on back . - Zoe ! - I can get it . I can get it , Donner . She might be able to make it to the object . She 'll never make it back . Mmm . Ahh . English - US - SDH

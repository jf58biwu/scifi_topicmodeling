 [ man 1 ] Are you watching closely ? [ chirping ] or acts . The first part is called " the pledge . " The magician shows you something ordinary . a bird or a man . [ applause ] He shows you this object . normal . it probably isn 't . Where do you think you 're going ? you fool . [ loud zapping ] The second act is called " the turn . " [ zapping ] The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary . you 're not really looking . You don 't really want to know . You want to be ... fooled . because making something disappear isn 't enough . You have to bring it back . That 's why every magic trick has a third act . The hardest part . The part we call " the prestige . " [ muffled screaming ] your employer get to that final part of his trick that night ? sir . Something went wrong . - What went wrong ? I saw someone making their way below stage . I followed him . watching Mr. Angier drown . Mr. Cutter . I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for performing them . was this water-filled tank beneath the stage part of Mr. Angier 's illusion ? No . The tank was brought on for the first trick and then taken offstage . Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the end of it . How large was this tank ? It 's a normal tank for escape under water about 400 or 500 gallons . How do you think he was able to move the tank under the trap door without anyone noticing ? ask him . - [ laughing ] [ man ] I ask again would this man explain the mechanics of Mr. Angier 's illusion . The Real Transported Man is one of the most sought after illusions in this business . I have the right to sell it on . the trick is worthless . How can we know that the tank wasn 't simply some part of the trick that went wrong ? I see your predicament . But Alfred Borden 's life hangs in the balance . If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private I might be able to judge their relevance to the case . Might this be an acceptable compromise ? [ guard ] I 'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets . sir . The warden saw his show in Manchester last year where he vanished into thin air . He 's convinced he 'll try and escape . [ men shouting ] I told him the only way Borden 's going to disappear is if I leave him out there with the other inmates . Check the locks twice . My name is Owens . I 'm a solicitor . an accomplished amateur magician and ... [ Borden ] How much ? - He is interested ... - How much for my tricks ? Five thousand pounds . my ing√©nieur . Money 's for him . I did . He offered to sell me your tricks . The Transported Man . I won 't forgive myself for selling my greatest trick . Even for your daughter ? your daughter is going to need looking after . Fallon will take care of her . Fallon . A man with a past as obscure as your own . The courts have motioned she be removed from his care . She will be an orphan . I know you 're no stranger to the workhouse . It 's better than here ? I 'm offering you a way to wrap up your affairs with dignity . I 'm offering your daughter a future . she will want for nothing ever . think it over . And Lord Caldlow would like you to have this as a show of good faith . It might be of interest . including the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick . - He never learned it . - Really ? he mounted a version of The Transported Man that the papers said was better even than your original . If you want Angier 's secrets you go dig him up and ask him yourself . Mr. Borden . Consider your daughter . an enigma ... a search for answers . it 'll take much longer to unravel the rest of Borden 's secrets . the cipher in his notebook is but it will still take months to translate his writing . And to know his mind . my passion is equal to the task . welcome to Colorado Springs . sir . Well quite a reception . Mr. Angier . Your telegram didn 't indicate how long you 'd be staying with us . As long as it takes . I will need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain . sir . For scientific experimentation . I know . That 's why I 'm here . Whoa . Whoa . sir . [ rumbling ] [ rumbling continues ] - [ electrical zapping ] - [ groans ] [ door slams ] [ man ] I 'm amazed how many of you newspaper writers can 't read my sign . Not the welcome I was expecting . I know you . You 're the Great Danton . I saw your show in London . Seven times you guessed every object the audience had in their pockets . I 'm Alley . Sorry about the fence . People keep interfering with our work . - I 've come to see Tesla . - Why ? He made a machine for a colleague of mine some time ago . I 'm afraid . I 've brought a lot of money . Mr. Angier . I simply can 't help . indefinitely . what am I holding ? Your watch . describes a show at the Orpheum Theater . That was just days after he first met me . two young men who never intended to hurt anyone . [ man ] Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman ? [ shouting ] [ man ] Me ! - [ applause ] - [ drum taps ] If you would tie her wrists bind her feet around the ankle . Are either of you two gentlemen sailors ? - No . - No . I 'm sure you can both tie a strong knot . [ drum tapping continues ] [ stopwatch ticking ] [ drum roll ] [ applause ] he 's boring . whatever that means so now he 's scared . He won 't take any risks at all . He 's squandering the goodwill of his audience with tired - second-rate tricks ... - They 're all favorites . Give me something fresh . He won 't even try a bloody bullet catch . A bullet catch is suicide . All it takes is some smartass volunteer to put a button in the barrel . - Use a plant . - You can 't for every trick . No seats left for the punters . but the point is a real magician tries to invent something new that other magicians will scratch their heads over . Then you sell it to him for a small fortune . - What ? - I suppose you have such a trick ? - I sure do . - Would you care to sell it to me ? No . No one else can do my trick . - Any trick can be duplicated . - Wrong . If Mr. Borden has invented his masterpiece he 's prepared to do it . but Borden is right he won 't get his hands dirty . If you want to see what it takes to make real magic go to the Tenley . There 's a Chinaman there and he really has what it takes . - Chung Ling Soo . - I can 't afford that . I know the bloke run the door . and whichever one of you can tell me how he does the goldfish bowl trick gets the prize . - Which is ? - Ten minutes onstage Mr. Ackerman . - Really ? - Who 's Ackerman ? The top theatrical agent in London . - I saw you drop the knot again . - [ woman ] I turned my wrists . do you ? if that knot slips and Julia 's on the hoist she 'll break her leg . It 's the wrong knot . the Langford double will hold tighter . The Langford double isn 't a wet knot . It 's too dangerous . she can 't slip it . - I can slip a Langford underwater . - We can practice . you know knots better than me ? no more mistakes . All right . Yeah ? Do you ? You want to take over ? - Just leave . - I didn 't think so . where 's he from ? Where are you from ? He shifts props for Virgil at the hall . - Worried he 'll steal your tricks ? - Doesn 't deal in methods . - How do you know ? - Because I hired him to find out how Virgil does the orange trick . - I don 't trust him . - He 's a natural magician . 'Course you can 't trust him . I think he 's all right . - You think everyone 's all right . - Even you . Watch your sightlines . If I can see you kiss your wife 's leg every night so can the blokes at the ends of rows three and four ! [ oriental-sounding guitar strumming ] [ snare drum roll ] [ Angier ] You 're wrong . It can 't be . - Look at the man . - This is the trick . This is the performance . Right here . This is why no one can detect his method . Total devotion to his art . A lot of self-sacrifice . You know . It 's the only way to escape ... you know ? I can barely lift this thing and it 's not even filled with water . look . I don 't know . Hang on a second . He must be strong as an ox . He 's been pretending to be a cripple for years . any time he goes out . It 's unthinkable . Borden saw it at once . But I couldn 't fathom it . Living my whole life pretending to be someone else . You are pretending . I don 't think changing a name compares . Not your name . Who you are and where you 're from . I promised I wouldn 't embarrass my family with my theatrical endeavors . I thought of a name for you . - The Great Danton . - [ chuckles ] Do you like it ? But it 's sophisticated . It 's French . [ Angier ] Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic . But what does he know of self-sacrifice ? You bloody fool . [ applause ] - [ whimpering ] He killed it . - It 's OK . - He killed it . - He didn 't . now he 'll bring it back . he didn 't . [ applause continues ] he 's all right . He 's fine . - Look at him . - But where 's his brother ? your son . he 's my nephew . Ah . [ chirping ] You 're the lucky one today . Are you watching closely ? Look closer . Never show anyone . They 'll beg you and flatter you for the secret you 'll be nothing to them . You understand ? Nothing . The secret impresses no one . The trick you use it for is everything . Mr. Borden . You 're welcome . it 's Alfred . Alfred . So I could use a cup of tea . I can 't allow ... It 's the landlord . It 's not ... You think that 's ... Is that enough to keep me out ? [ chuckling ] I think so . So I 'll see you again ? Milk and sugar ? What 's in there ? Angier 's machine . Mr. Cutter ? sir . This wasn 't built by a magician . This was built by a wizard . A man who can actually do what magicians pretend to do . what happens with these things after the trial ? They 've been sold to a Lord Caldlow . very interested in the case . don 't let him take this . - Why ever not ? - It 's too dangerous . I 'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it 's got a simple and disappointing trick . sir . It has no trick . It 's real . [ scoffs ] This is the tank Angier drowned in ? Yes . This is the place where the performer 's hand reaches through to the trick padlock . A standard magical apparatus for escapes ? with one important difference . This isn 't a trick lock . It 's been switched for a real one . What a way to kill someone . Your Honor . men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths to shock . Even without an audience ? There was an audience . this water tank was of particular significance to these two men . Particularly awful significance . [ Milton ] Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman ? [ drum taps ] If you would tie her wrists bind her feet around the ankle . - Are either of you gentlemen sailors ? - No . [ laughter ] I 'm sure you can both tie a strong knot . [ Milton claps ] [ stopwatch ticking ] [ drum roll ] [ gasps ] Robert ! no . Julia . Julia ! [ gasps ] [ Cutter ] I knew an old sailor once . They told me he went overboard tangled in the sails . They pulled him out but it took him five minutes to cough . He said it was like going home . Borden ? Angier . Which knot did you tie ? I keep asking myself that . - And ? - And ... I just don 't know . You don 't know ? I 'm sorry . You don 't know ? - Alfred ? - Good news . We got our first booking . I don 't think we 've had the pleasure . - Mr. Fallon is my ing√©nieur . - Where did you get all ... ? - I had to borrow and ... don 't ask . - He 's a very enterprising soul is ... is Mr. Fallon . So ... - We can 't afford to pay him . - The money will come with the audience . it 's barely enough for us . Don 't worry about it . I 'll share half my food with him or something . You 're going to be doing that with someone else . No . You 're ... Having a baby . my God . We should have told Fallon . That is great . come here . [ chuckling ] Oh . what is this ? this is just the trick to work Ackerman up at the end of my act . the great trick ? the world is not ready for that one yet . spectacular bullet catch . but it 's safe . I promise . Look . - Shoot me . - Shoot you ? shoot me . I can 't . not there . Shoot me here . Don 't ... - [ laughs ] - How 's that ? That 's very good . Tell me how you do it . I can 't do that . then you can 't do it . - I can 't do it ? but I can 't raise a child on my own . You don 't tell anybody that I told you . - OK . - Gunpowder . Wadding . Then the bullet . Ramrod . Hold out your hand . The bullet is not even in the gun when the charge is fired . it 's actually very obvious . you still get ... It 's dangerous . - People still get killed doing that . - How ? You get some smartass who could put a penny or a button somebody could put a bullet down there . Don 't worry . Don 't worry because I 'm not gonna let anything happen . Everything 's gonna be all right because I love you very much . - Say it again . - I love you . - Not today . - What ? and today you don 't mean it . Maybe today you 're more in love with magic than me . I like being able to tell the difference . It makes the days it is true mean something . All right . [ booing ] ladies and gentlemen . If there are any ladies and gentlemen here . - Solid metal . - [ man ] Seen that already . [ booing ] Who threw that ? [ booing continues ] is it ? So who wants to volunteer ? - [ man ] I do ! - [ man 2 ] Me ! [ shouting ] Me . Me . [ audience silent ] sir ? Yes . Borden ? Borden ? I don 't know . - [ gunshot ] - [ gasps ] [ groaning ] and I told him the truth . the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double . I can never know for sure . How can he not know ! [ Angier ] How can he not know ? He must know what he did . He must . that bloody hurts . I don 't understand how it can be bleeding again . It 's as bad as the day it happened . - We have to get a doctor back . - We can 't afford the doctor back . [ baby cries ] - You 've woken her . - Great . I need this to heal so I can get back to work . You 've got to face things . What tricks can you perform with this injury ? I can do car pulls . I can do some prop tricks . I can still do that . I can do the trick I 've been telling you about . The one that they 're gonna remember me for . Come on . I never thought I 'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass . Hasn 't stopped your looking . Heard about a booking . Nice little theater . up-and-coming magician . - Who ? - You . - Me ? Booking ? Why ? I want to keep on working . Who 's going to hire the ing√©nieur that killed Julia McCullough in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum ? Someone who knows it wasn 't your fault . Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots . I hear he had a spot of bad luck catching a bullet south of the river . that one . We 'll have to whitewash the windows but it will do . [ stomps on floor ] - We should see about an assistant . - I 've made some arrangements . You settled on a name ? I have . The Great Danton . isn 't it ? it 's sophisticated . The birdcage can 't be our climax . Everybody knows it . - Not like this . - I don 't want to kill doves . Then stay off the stage . not a wizard . if you 're going to achieve the impossible . Miss Wenscombe . No point in meeting Mr. Angier if you don 't fit . On the right . - What 's so hard about this ? - Nothing . You 're going ... down here . [ indistinct talking ] sure . - Tighten up on there . - Yep . OK . This ties up here ? - Ties in the back . - Good . Breathe as little as possible . you see ? - That 's it . - OK . She 's not experienced but she knows how to present herself . A pretty assistant is the most effective form of misdirection . for my final trick I will require the assistance of two volunteers . if you would oblige me ? Yep . yeah . Come around his foot . - Careful . - It 's all right . [ grinding ] put their hand there . - Yeah ? And another one here . please . Olivia . Mr. Angier . - Of course not . - Ready ? Right . - One ... - Two ... Three . Cutter . Very nice . And the best part is ... [ chuckling ] I thought you said I had to get my hands dirty . perhaps you will . I just had to know that you can . indeed . I haven 't had the chance to compliment you on your beautiful theater . It 'll be a lot more beautiful when it 's full . Don 't worry . You all say that . Why should I worry ? somebody else 's will . Maybe somebody willing to do a bullet catch or a water escape ? Mr. Merrit . likely to see one too . What would that do for your business ? John . Mr. Merrit . - [ chuckles ] [ up-tempo classical music ] Thank you . - [ music ends ] - [ applause ] in the third row there . Please stand up and show us your handkerchief . - [ laughter ] - This isn 't mine . Perhaps you 'd return it to the lady in the aisle of the second row . I believe she has yours . [ applause ] [ up-tempo piano music ] I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I 'm making so many mistakes . I 'm so nervous . The audience doesn 't seem to be responding . They 've seen a lot of tricks before but not this next one . Cloth over . Keep your fingers crossed . I 'll have the champagne ready . [ applause ] [ Angier chuckles ] [ all groaning ] - You 've seen this one before ? - [ man ] We 've seen them all before . shall I ? please . A lady and a gentlemen . To hold this cage with me . I 'll perform this feat in a manner never before seen by yourselves or any other audience anywhere in the world . [ drum roll ] place one hand on the back of the cage one hand on the front . one hand on the bottom of the cage one hand on the top . - [ snapping ] - [ woman screams ] - I should 've spotted him . - You had a lot of plates going . - Don 't suppose we can do this again . - No . what 's the climax of our show ? - Show ? - You don 't have a show . - We have a week 's engagement . not butcher birds and break my customers ' fingers . anything here in the morning gets burned . John . I 've hired a comedian . You know I hate comedians . there 's plenty of good theaters . If we can come up with a new trick - change the name of the act . - The name stays . then the new trick 's gonna have to be irresistible then . I have a couple of methods to try out . And then we need a new angle on the presentation . And if you need some inspiration there 's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week . you know ? That sort of thing captures the public 's imagination . [ thunder rumbling ] Mind if I join you ? Tesla sends me down here during the storms . Perfect excuse to come join the Great Danton for a drink . Two of them . though . - Why are you here ? - The lightning lives here . And not much else . Our work is secret . That a cipher ? A rotating transposition that shifts every day of the diary . even with the five-letter keyword . Which is ? We magicians have a circle of trust . You have a circle of trust with someone whose diary you stole ? Maybe I bought it . And you 're hoping to find a great secret in there ? I 've already found it . That 's why I 'm here . Tesla built one for another magician . Why would you want the same thing ? Call it a professional rivalry . Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people . - But he would never talk about it . - I understand discretion . I just want the machine . Finish your drink . I want to show you something . I think you 'll have a special appreciation for our work . - I thought it was a secret . - You 're a magician . Who 's gonna believe you ? Not long now . Our equipment requires a great deal of current . Tesla electrified the whole town in exchange for using the generators when we need them . We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep . Mr. Tesla doesn 't want to scare anyone . [ electrical humming ] Where are the wires ? Exactly . Where 's the generator ? You saw it last week . - That must be ten miles from here . - Fifteen . And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed . Mr. Angier . [ Angier ] Magic . Real magic . only here at London 's Royal Albert Hall one of the miracles of our age . A technological marvel . You 've never seen anything like it in your lives . Your eyes will not believe what they 're witnessing . ladies and gentlemen . clean power . Like to know the future ? The man who 's speaking right now is going to change the world . no waiting . [ loud electrical zapping ] Ladies and gentlemen [ gasps ] objections have been raised ... They should be raised . Does that look safe to you ? Part of Thomas Edison 's smear campaign against Mr. Tesla 's superior alternating current . [ man ] We have asked Mr. Tesla to reconsider . [ man 2 ] Which he will not ! But I 've been told he refuses to appear under any such restrictions . - [ gasps ] - This thing 's gonna blow . please . [ Borden ] Hey . Jess . Have you had a nice day with mommy ? Huh ? Sarah . today it 's true . - Yeah . - Hello . [ Angier ] I saw happiness . Happiness that should have been mine . But I was wrong . His notebook reveals that he never had the life that I envied . demanding freedom . His mind ... his mind is a divided one . His soul is restless . tormented by his fickle and contradictory nature . what do you think you 'll call her ? I don 't know . what 's hers ? Maybe Sarah . That 's a lovely name . That 's a lovely name . you talk about what you want to do for the rest of the day . you talk with her . Are they taking her away ? To the workhouse ? You keep talking . Tell Owens I 've reconsidered . Take it . take it . It 's for the best . Let me see . I 'm gonna learn all the professor 's secrets . Only if I teach you how to read . right ? have they ? professor ? Maybe I 'm just biding my time . Maybe one day I 'll ... get your attention Are you watching closely ? Maybe a magic whirl or two . And then I 'll be gone . How 'd you get so famous then ? Magic . get back here ! - [ all laughing ] Thank you . Shut up ! [ laughing continues ] Where 's the bloody key ? ! [ distant electrical humming ] 1899 . a breakthrough . Tesla 's agreed to see me . [ electrical zapping ] Perfectly safe . So this is the Great Danton . Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions . Hold out other hand . Mr. Angier . producing energy . Mr. Angier ? [ chuckling ] I need something impossible . " Man 's reach exceeds his grasp " ? Is a lie . Man 's grasp exceeds his nerve . Society only tolerates one change at a time . First time I tried to change the world I was hailed as a visionary . Second time I was asked politely to retire . enjoying my retirement . Mr. Angier . What you want is simply expensive . If I were to build for you this machine you would be presenting it merely as illusion ? if people actually believed the things I did on stage they 'd scream . Think of sawing a woman in half . Have you considered the cost of this ? Price is not an object . but have you considered the cost ? I 'm not sure I follow . forget this thing . I can recognize an obsession . - No good will come of it . - Hasn 't good come of your obsessions ? but I have followed them too long . I am their slave . they will choose to destroy me . then you know you won 't change my mind . So be it . Will you build it ? Mr. Angier . I hope you enjoy the mountain air . This will take some time . exhale ] Uh ... I thought you 'd gone . I don 't really have anywhere to go . You 've been sleeping here ? Cutter said it 'd be all right till we get another booking . What are you doing ? Uh ... research . Part of a magician 's job see what illusions ... aren 't you ? Cutter 's hoping you let things lie . He says if Borden thinks things are even between you ... Even ? My wife for a couple of his fingers ? He has a family now and he 's performing again . Borden is out there living his life just as he intended as if nothing had happened and look at me . I 'm alone and no theater will touch me . Us . You 're going to need a better disguise . I need a volunteer . [ Wenscombe ] What happened ? Did you hurt him ? Robert ? yes ? Thank you . Just a rubber ball ? No . Not normal . Not a normal rubber ball . It 's magic . He had a new trick . [ Wenscombe ] Was it good ? It was the greatest magic trick I 've ever seen . - [ door opens ] - [ minimal applause ] [ Angier ] Did they applaud when you saw it ? It was too good . It was too simple . The audience hardly had time to see it . - He 's a dreadful magician . - A wonderful magician . He 's a dreadful showman . He doesn 't dress it up - how to sell it . - How does he do it ? it 's too simple . This is a complex illusion . You say that because you don 't know the method . It 's a double that comes out . It 's the only way . I 've seen him perform it three times . The prestige is the same man . it 's not . - The same man comes out of the cabinet . It 's the same man . He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers you can tell . but I do . we could use it as a climax to the show . Yes . I 'm gonna steal his trick . We got to find someone who looks like you . - He doesn 't use a double . - I don 't know how Borden does it . Either ... You either wait for him to retire and buy the secret or you listen to how I would do it . And the only way that I know how to do it is to find you a bloody good double . All right . Take a good look . Let 's get out there and find me . Whoo ! look . What 's that ? - It 's for you . - What 's this for ? Come . [ Sarah ] You ... - I asked you last week ... - You caught me in a wrong mood . - But you won 't ever ... - Sarah aren 't I ? things will work out . I can 't believe it . Thank you . Thank you . It 's beautiful . look at you . I 'd like you to meet Gerald Root . Mm-hm . - [ whispering indistinctly ] - [ Wenscombe giggles ] A pleasure . Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen . Would you like for me to tell you a little joke ? Come here . Yes . Are you laughing now ? [ chuckling ] I have to take a piss . he 's an out-of-work actor . He 's perfect . He needs a little help . he could be your brother . I need him to be me . Give me a month . So you open the door and ... [ chuckling ] [ exhales ] Come on . - [ groans ] - [ chuckling ] Couldn 't you have found a softer one ? it 's not for sleeping on . if you come down through there ... - ... does Root go up through there ? - Yep . It 's going to be amazing . it has to be . Borden 's trick is getting noticed . The place was packed today . You went and saw his show again . Mr. Angier ? [ Root sighs ] [ Wenscombe giggles ] All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk and no one will be able to tell the difference . sir . Mr. Root ? [ clapping ] if you knew the world half as well as I do . Did you think you were unique ? I 've played Faust . How difficult could it possibly be to play the Great Danton ? for nothing . I 'd rather be him for now . uh ... amusing . [ chuckles ] My liege I did deny no prisoners . thank you . the game 's up . I don 't know how you do things . I 'm not sure I wanna know . Have you thought what we should call it ? There 's no point being coy . Borden calls his trick The Transported Man . [ applause ] much of what you 've seen may be termed - as illusions or entertaining trifles . - [ rimshot ] [ applause ] Alas ... [ drumroll ] ... I cannot claim this next feat as illusion . Watch carefully . You will see no trickery for no trickery is employed . Merely a technique familiar to certain citizens of the Orient and various holy men of the Himalayas . many of you may be familiar with this technique do not be alarmed . What you 're about to see is considered safe . cheering ] cheering continues ] To our achievement . The manager says he 's never seen a reaction like it . At least he saw it . I spent the ovation hiding under the stage . No one cares about the man who disappears . They care about the one who comes out . I care about the man in the box . maybe we could switch before the trick . and Root 's below stage . the anticipation of the trick is everything . We need your showmanship to build up the suspense . it 's over . He can 't introduce this trick . Of course I can . I 'm the Great Danton . get out of that wardrobe and makeup . Anyone could walk in here at any minute . all . Life is not full of these moments . We worked hard . We need to celebrate properly . What 's wrong ? Is it your wife ? it 's the trick . It isn 't good enough . Borden 's trick is nothing compared to ours . He has no style . He doesn 't spend the finale hiding under the stage . - I need to know how he does it . - Why ? So I can do it better . I need you to go and work for him . Work for him ? Are you joking ? You 'll be my spy . We just got our start . You want me to leave ? That 's how we advance . Think of it . People are excited by Cutter 's version . Imagine what we 'd do with the real illusion . We 'd have the greatest magic act anyone 's ever seen . - He knows I work for you . - Exactly why he 'll want to hire you . - He 'll want my secret . - Why would he trust me ? Because you 're gonna tell him the truth . Hmm ? Good girl . [ rattling ] You must be curious to see what so much money has bought you . Fitting you should be here for her maiden voyage . Your hat . You might want to stand back . [ electric zapping ] [ fizzling ] I don 't understand . Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it . Mr. Tesla ? - No . Come back next week . - Next week ? it will be fine . - Tesla ! Just a little temperamental . [ door closing ] we make do . - My name is Olivia ... - I know who you are . Here to steal the rest of my show ? To give your show what it 's missing . what might that be ? - Me . wasn 't I ? - A woman 's touch . - I 've left Angier . - All right . - I want a job . Yeah . I know you 've no reason to trust me . Why wouldn 't I trust you ? You 're only the mistress of my enemy . Why wouldn 't I trust you ? - Mr. Borden . - Alfred . I 'm going to tell you the truth . Now that is a slippery notion Miss Wenscombe ? I am here because he sent me here . He wants me to work for you and steal your secret . What does he need my secret for ? His trick is topnotch . and then he reappears instantly overweight very drunk . Olivia does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage ? It 's killing him . He 's obsessed with discovering your methods . takes no pleasure in our success . And I 've had enough . There is no future with him . but I 've come to offer you his . This is the truth ... is it ? sir . you 're late and more drunk than usual . Get down below stairs right away . No . Mr. Cutter . Borden is performing right across the street . we have a bigger problem . Root . He 's realized that he can make demands . Wha ... ? He 's blackmailing us ? to tell you the truth . It usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out . - How much does he want ? - It makes no difference . - We 've got to stop doing the trick . - Stop the trick ? Look at this . Last week they said you were the premier stage performer in London . mind you . Performer of any kind . you 've climbed too high to get away with professional embarrassment . We don 't do any tricks we can 't control . Just pay him for now . We keep doing the trick until Borden opens and then we 'll phase it out . All right . [ Angier ] Cutter was always surprised how fast Root turned bad . To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale ? sh . because I 'll be mobbed with fans . [ Angier ] We paid him enough to keep him in beers . You wouldn 't expect him to rock the boat . Many of you may be familiar with this technique do not be alarmed . What you 're about to see is considered safe . - And who are you ? - I am a humble admirer and a fellow practitioner . Mmm . Very good . [ grunts ] if you insist . - [ Borden ] Another . - I 'm not performing tonight . but to be frank my people pretty much run things these days . Get up there . Get up ! The Transported Man I 'm not claiming to know your methods but I had a similar trick in my act uh ... [ whispering ] I used a double . and then it went bad . What I didn 't count on was that when I incorporated this bloke into my act he had complete power over me . you say ? [ laughing ] [ applause ] [ grunting ] Ohh ! [ laughs ] Be very careful giving someone that power over you . Huh . Thank you . Um ... thank you for the warning . Hmm . Cheers . I cannot claim this next feat as illusion . What you 're about to see is considered safe . Ahh ! [ moaning ] [ crowd laughing ] [ applause ] [ chuckling ] applause ] Oh ! The Great Danton . I apologize . There simply is too much magic for my stage at The Pantages across the street . Pardon my intrusion . And go easy on the poor chap . He does try so very hard . applauding ] I don 't know how Borden found him . Kept him under wraps . I was careful . he did . Do you think it was her ? You weren 't expecting me ? I expected you sooner . Your message said afternoon . It takes a bit for me to get around these days . my career - now you . - You sent me . not to improve his act . - It 's my job . - Or fall in love ! - I did everything you asked ! - Yes ? Yes ? a double . - ' Course he said that . - He didn 't say it . wigs . We don 't use for the show . - I 've seen it hidden backstage . - Misdirection . He leaves them lying around to make you think that . He doesn 't know when I 'm looking . Olivia ! That 's who he is ! That 's what it takes ! don 't you see ? Just because you 're sleeping with him doesn 't mean he trusts you . don 't you ? The Great Danton is a blind fool . His notebook . You stole it ? I borrowed it for tonight . I thought you could translate some of it ... I can 't . No one can . It 's a cipher . it will take months to decode . - And without the keyword ? - Perhaps never . - We 'll see . - We will not see . If I don 't get that back by tomorrow he 'll know I took it . - Leave him . - I can 't . He knows where I live . Olivia . All of his secrets are right here in my hands . It won 't bring your wife back . I don 't care about my wife . I care about his secret . grunts ] um ... I 'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in . me . Not you . Understand ? Robert . I have fallen in love with him . Then I know how hard this has been for you . Notebook ? Then he 's just getting started . [ clapping ] - [ drumroll ] - [ cymbal crashes ] [ electrical zapping ] [ applause ] [ all ] Professor ! Good evening . [ chattering ] I 'm walking tonight . Let him come . I don 't care . [ all ] Professor ! Professor ! [ man yells ] [ heart beating ] coughing ] - [ gunshot ] - Ahh ! - You all right ? - I 'm alive . Saves me cutting you an air hole . - I 'm impressed . - Why is that ? You 're finally getting your hands dirty . Angier . sacrifice . is all gonna be yours unless you give me what I want . - Which is ? - Your secret . My secret ? Your method for The Transported Man . Fallon wouldn 't tell me . He doesn 't talk at all . - You have my notebook . - Useless without the keyword . describe it in full . not the keyword . I don 't know if your secret 's in your notebook . The keyword is the method . Where 's my ing√©nieur ? - Alive ? - How fast can you dig ? you hear me ? Fallon ! - [ Angier ] How 's the arm ? - Still attached . Did you find your answer ? Cutter . I haven 't looked yet . I wanted you to share this . Robert . the same way as we do . It 's just that you want something more . shall we ? What does it mean ? we have a journey ahead of us . - To America . - Robert ? Listen to me . Obsession is a young man 's game . Come on . I can 't follow you any further in it . I 'm sorry . Then the rest is up to me . I 'm sorry . darling . [ laughs ] your finest . I didn 't know we were going to be joined for dinner . we are celebrating . Mr. Fallon . - What are we celebrating ? - We 've hit upon a new trick . Freddie ? what trick ? I am going to bury myself alive every night and then someone will come along and dig me up . Wonderful . pour the champagne . don 't talk to me like that . I 'm not a bloody child . escort her home . please . - I see no reason you should suffer . - Don 't ruin this evening . Freddie . - Freddie ? - That 's my name . am I ? Couldn 't you have at least taken off the beard ? I just came from the bloody theater just now . All right ? I 'm out in public . Everybody else loves it . Why are you being like this ? I had a terrible ordeal today . I thought that something very precious had been lost to me . So I just wanted to celebrate just a little . what ? What did you lose ? more secrets . secrets are my life . this isn 't you . Stop performing . [ shudders ] I thought I had the place to myself . not very polite . A lot of questions . I thought they worked for the government . they work for Thomas Edison . a most curious development . His assistant came to us with a proposition . Angier has sent her and told her to admit as much . Does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage ? but I 've come to offer you his . This is the truth is it ? that 's what he told me to tell you . The truth is that I loved him and I stood by him and he sent me to you like he would send a stagehand to pick up his shirts . I hate him for that . I could spot Angier 's methods from the back of the theater . what could you possibly have to offer me ? You may know his tricks but you can 't understand why no one sees yours are better . You hide this . I had to look very closely to spot it during The Transported Man but this makes you unique . It shows you aren 't using a double . You mustn 't hide it . You must display it proudly . I 'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand . it does . So let people know . You can be so much more than he is and I can show you how . [ Borden ] I think she 's telling the truth . I think we cannot trust her . But I love her . I need her . of love . But how to be sure ? I know a way . It 's the only way to know her mind . How could he send you away ? [ Borden ] She must help me rid ourselves of Angier . my mistress proves her truthfulness . you understand . I 've been convinced since she led me to Root . Olivia proves her love for me Angier . she gave you this notebook at my request . not to my trick . You really think I 'd part with my secret so easily after so much ? Angier . May you find solace for your forward ambition back in your American home . Tesla ! Tesla ! Alley ! Alley ! Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for . - I never said he had . - You let me believe that he had . You stole my money because your funding was cut off . You 've been shooting sparks in my top hat while using my money to stave off ruin . - I have seen Edison 's men . - Where ? I have a mind to bring them up here . Mr. Angier . It is true that you are our last remaining financier but we have not stolen your money . This is my cat . I spoke a truth . Why isn 't it working ? Mr. Angier is not an exact science . The machine simply does not operate as expected . - It requires further examination . - So where did my top hat go ? Nowhere . We tried the damn thing a dozen times . The hat went nowhere . We need to try different material . It may provoke a different result . [ meowing ] Great . doctor . [ meows ] [ electrical zapping ] [ sighs ] I hope whatever you were really doing with my money Mr. Tesla . [ meowing ] [ cats screeching ] [ screeching continues ] [ hissing ] Alley ! So the machine was working ? 'cause the hat never moved . These things never quite work as you expect them to . That 's one of the principal beauties of science . I 'll need a couple of weeks to iron out the problems with the machine . We 'll send word when it 's ready . Don 't forget your hat . which one is mine ? - They are all your hats . You look so pretty in this new dress of yours . Daddy has some errands to run . did I ? we shall . and I 'll be back before you know it . So you go get ready . We 'll go see those chimpanzees . [ hoots ] Sarah ... what are you doing ? Each of us have our vices . whatever you may think your only competition for my affections is our little girl . I love you . I will always love you and you alone . - You mean it today . - Absolutely . Which makes it so much harder when you don 't . More shopping . She does love the smell of money . yeah ? if not . uh ... Sarah she knows . at least she knows that something is not right so if you can just do whatever you can to help me . just convince her that I do love her . Freddie ? please . It 's nothing . It 's just that sometimes it seems wrong . you 're with me . Leave your family at home where they belong . Olivia . - I 'll get dressed . - Yeah . I saw Fallon hanging around again . There 's something about that man I don 't trust . You trust me ? Then trust Fallon . He protects the things that I care about . [ engine sputters ] Mr. Angier . as well . He 's very good to Colorado Springs . Mr. Angier I didn 't think it was necessary to tell Edison 's men about the box . What box ? [ Tesla ] I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye . But I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado . The truly extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry . where people are happy to be mystified . You will find what you are looking for in this box . Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions . I add only one suggestion on using the machine . Destroy it . Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean . Such a thing will bring you only misery . [ Angier ] Tesla 's warning is as unheeded as he knew it would be . Today I tested the machine . Taking precautions in case Tesla hadn 't ironed out the kinks in its operation . I would not want to live like that for long . [ electrical zapping ] Borden . for my murder . that 's a fake . it 's not . The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt . for which we have numerous examples . It don 't matter . So my tricks . - All of them . - Including The Transported Man ? he won 't . They 're not complete . It 's just the pledge and the turn for each . these are worthless . Yeah . You get the rest of it ... when you bring my daughter here . I want to say goodbye . [ Sarah ] We have to go through it now . We have to go through it now . deny it all you want . Olivia means nothing . - Olivia ? - I need an assistant . I 'll tell her . - You 'll tell her what ? Alfred . Sarah . - I can 't keep it in . - You can 't talk like this . shut up ! I don 't want to hear it anymore . You can 't talk like this . I know . Alfred . I can 't live like this . you think I can live like this ? You think I bloody enjoy living like this ? we 're married . What is so wrong with your life ? I can 't live like this ! what do you want from me ? I ... I want ... I want you to be ... honest with me . No tricks . No lies . And no secrets . Do you ... do you love me ? Not today . No . [ birds chirping ] - [ crashing ] - [ birds squawking ] [ seagulls calling ] [ birds fluttering ] Who 's there ? I 'm looking for an old friend . nice little theater - good up-and-coming magician . - You 're back . John . Good rehearsal space . I like it . [ laughs ] You always had a good eye for publicity . John . It 's my last show . A limited engagement . Your last show ? A wise man once told me obsession was a young man 's game . I 'm almost done . There 's one thing left . The Real Transported Man . You want to design a show around it ? I don 't want you backstage I need you in front managing . Call in any favors or connections you have left to get us the right booking . What sort of booking you after ? The sort that Borden can 't ignore . sir . You told me you only wanted to show me one trick that 'd pique my interest . Mr. Ackerman . shall we ? gentlemen . Very pretty . Cutter ? He simply disappears ? That 's not a trick . He has to come back . - There has to be a ... - [ Angier ] A prestige ? Exactly . Pardon me . It 's very rare to see real magic . It 's been many years since ... Are you interested in helping us ? Yes ... but you 'll have to dress it up a little . Disguise it . Give them enough reason to doubt it . not once . hm ? Because she was a part of your life and now she 's gone . the day before she killed herself she said she wanted to meet me . That she had something to tell me about you . I couldn 't bring myself to face her . But what would she have said ? You want to know the truth about me ? The truth is that I never loved Sarah . I never loved her . you had a child with her . but the other part didn 't . the part that 's sitting here right now . I love you . That 's the truth . That is the truth that matters . You could be in some other restaurant with some other woman right now talking about me that way . - No . - Yes . It 's inhuman to be so cold . He 's back . he 's got a new trick . They 're saying it 's the best London 's ever seen . Professor . You should go to him . You two deserve each other . But I 'm afraid I 'm booked . The Moscow Ballet plays through next year . no less . no matinees . That 's what you 'll charge for each ticket . Good day . [ applause ] [ footsteps on stage ] my first trick of the evening involves considerable risk . Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocably damaged by seeing a man drown should leave now . When I tell you the lady who taught me this illusion actually died performing it you 'll understand the seriousness of the dangers involved . - Let 's begin . - [ applause ] I have seen the future . indeed . ladies and gentlemen is on the brink of new and terrifying possibilities . [ taps cane ] [ applause ] What you 're about to witness is not magic . It 's purely science . I 'd like to invite you to come up on stage now so that you can examine the machine for yourselves . [ electrical zapping ] gasping ] [ applause ] Man 's reach exceeds his imagination . cheering ] Bravo ! One hundred performances . Why ? Does his method dictate that ? Is it a publicity move ? What is it ? and they call him the bloody best in England . Why ? Fifty yards in a second ! In a second ! And all that we know is he uses a trap door . Brilliant ! What is going on under that stage ? Huh ? ! Why can 't you out-think him ? after each performance . Yeah ? [ sighs ] [ Borden ] Huh . - [ crumpling paper ] - We 're done . All right ? Let him have his trick . I don 't need his secret . So ... you leave him alone . Both of us ... just leave him alone . We 're done . John . I don 't want you backstage on this one . [ Angier ] I would like to invite you onstage now so that you can examine the machine for yourselves . you fool . [ electric zapping ] Who was that ? [ rumbling ] [ zapping continues ] [ silence ] - [ muffled screaming ] - Hey ! Where 's the bloody key ? ! Where 's the bloody key ? ! [ Borden yelling ] Where 's the bloody key ? ! He 's bloody drowning ! Hold on ! [ screams ] What have you done ? you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier . You will be hanged by the neck until dead . May the Lord have mercy on your soul . [ Owens ] Mr. Cutter ? Owens . Mr. Owens . It has fallen to me to dispose of Mr. Angier 's equipment . But I notice from this manifest that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items . if you need to know where to deliver these items ... it 's just there is one particular item in fact - I would like to ... - You would like to buy . I suppose so . - This is the machine ? - Yes . I 'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant about purchasing this particular item . Do you think I could talk to Lord Caldlow in person ? I 'm afraid . Of course in the course of your delivery arrangements I can 't stop you speaking your mind . Thank you . [ door opens ] Borden ? - For now . You got a visitor . Lord Caldlow . With a little girl . Jess ? my love . How are you ? I 've missed you so much . Fallon 's missed you too . We both have . can I come in there ? darling . but everything is gonna be all right . You must be Lord Caldlow ? I am . I always have been . They flatter you with all those chains . Don 't they know you can 't escape without your rubber ball ? I pulled you out ... out of that tank . All I wanted to do was prove that I was a better magician . But you couldn 't leave me alone . I don 't know what you 've done . are you ? not anymore . And I win . the man who disappears . You win ? This ain 't a bloody competition anymore . This is my little girl 's life . And don 't you dare put her in the middle of this . I know how hard it is to have someone so special Borden ? can you ? she 'll be looked after . darling . my darling . here . That 's what you 're after . That 's what this is about . Take it . - Your secret ? - Yeah . You always were the better magician . We both know that . you have to agree mine is better . Jess ! I 'm gonna take you home soon . I promise . - For God 's sake . - I promise . Look ! Jess . I love you . - Come on . - I love you . Jess . Angier ! Angier ! do you think this place can hold me ? Angier ! They 're gonna bloody hang me ! And you can put a stop to this now ! Listen ! Listen ! That man ... that man is the one I 'm in for killing ! I 'm not guilty ! - I 'm not guilty ! - I don 't care ! - Get hold of him . - Angier ! Run along now . there 's a gentleman waiting . Cutter . You 're still alive . How is it you 're still alive ? for God 's sake . sir . Jess . I 've seen her before . I saw her in court with Fallon . - What have you done ? - She needs looking after . She needs her father . and I helped you . I came here to beg Lord Caldlow to let me destroy that machine . I am not going to beg you for anything . You don 't have to . I 'm gonna make sure it is never used again . Lord Caldlow where do you want me to deliver it ? My theater . It belongs with the prestige materials . I tried not to involve you . So ... We go alone now . Both of us . I don 't have as far to go as you . No . You were right . I should have left him to his damn trick . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry for a lot of things . I 'm sorry about Sarah . I didn 't . all right ? You live for both of us . Goodbye . Are you watching closely ? Put it down on the end . Take a minute to consider your achievement . I once told you about a sailor who described drowning to me . he said it was like going home . I was lying . He said it was agony . in the name of the king and the High Court of England you will meet your end . No one cares about the man in the box . Cutter ? Cutter ! [ man ] Do you have anything to say ? Abracadabra . [ gunshot ] [ moans ] [ Angier moans ] A brother ? A twin ? You were Fallon . - The whole time ? - No . We were both Fallon . We were both Borden . Were you the one who went into the box ? Or the one who came back out ? We took turns . The trick is where we would swap . Cutter knew . Cutter knew . too easy . No . but not easy . There 's nothing easy about two men sharing one life . how it can be bleeding again ? Wha ... What about Olivia and your wife ? We each loved one of them . I loved Sarah . He loved Olivia . We each had half of a full life which was enough for us just . But not for them . Robert that 's the price of a good trick . would you ? [ groaning ] I 've ... I 've made sacrifices . - No . - Yes . It takes nothing to steal another man 's work . it takes everything . I 'm not ... [ gunshot ] It took courage . It took courage to climb into that machine every night not knowing if I 'd be the man in the box or in the prestige . Do you want to see what it cost me ? did you ? Look . Look . I don 't care . You went halfway around the world . You spent a fortune . You did terrible things . Robert . And all for nothing . For nothing ? [ Borden ] Yeah . You never understood why we did this . The audience knows the truth . The world is simple . It 's miserable . Solid ... Solid all the way through . But if you could fool them even for a second then you could make them wonder . And then you ... Then you got to see something very special . You really don 't know . It was it was the look on their faces . [ inhales deeply ] or acts . The first part is called " the pledge . " The magician shows you something ordinary . The second act is called " the turn . " The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it into something extraordinary . because making something disappear isn 't enough . You have to bring it back . Now you 're looking for the secret . you 're not really looking . You don 't really want to work it out . You want to be fooled .

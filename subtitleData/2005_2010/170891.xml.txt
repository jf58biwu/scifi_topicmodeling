 we are not a threat we are salvation the world will have to deal with us Previously on the 4400 ... you know those visions that maia used to have ? It turns out she was only pretending that they stopped . How long have you known ? Not long . I only found out because I read her diary . You 're one of those 4400 guys. huh ? One day . all of this will be yours . But you 're not going anywhere . Whatever you do. shawn . don 't reveal your healing ability . because if you heal one of them . you 'll have to heal them all . I 'm blacking out . If you 're losing chunks of time . you should talk to your dad about it . What 's he going to do. turn me over to ntac medical ? Can I help you ? Heidi.it 's mommy . Who ? That 's okay. sweetie . I got it . She 's my daughter . She doesn 't know that . She thinks carol is her mother . Brian. look . I need your help . Richard. he 's been arrested . Okay . I 'll make a few calls and do whatever I can . Hello. richard . I want you to come home . If I 'm lying . isabelle will punish me accordingly . If isabelle accepts me . well. then I can offer you and lily and the child a new life . Let her judge me . Hush-a-bye . hush-a-bye go to sleep little baby when you wake I 'll give you cake and all the pretty little horses and go to sleep-y little baby who 's a special girl ? Is isabelle a special girl ? Is she ? Come here . Look at him with isabelle . This keeps up. we 're going to have to start calling him " uncle jordan . " There 's something so wrong about that . Isn 't there ? A week ago. he was the one guy we were trying to keep away from her . - and now it 's like ... - they 've bonded . She 's really taken to him . Is that the couple of the hour ? Hi . Richard. what 's up. man ? It 's good to see you . Look at you . Oh. you look great . You look great . So how long do you guys think you 're going to be staying ? We 're not sure . Collier said we could stay at the center till we get back on our feet . Did he get you squared away with ntac ? Started to . His lawyers took our statements . I guess we 're looking at back fines for not reporting in . Well. hey . I 'm sure jordan will take care of it . He offered to. but I think we 're going to try and swing it ourselves . Well. hey. you picked the right week to come . This reunion thing 's going to be big. huh ? We 've got 4400s coming in from 27 different countries . Three more maybes . There haven 't been this many of us in the same place since quarantine . What 's happened since we left town ? I mean. suddenly it seems like everyone 's dying to meet a real. live 4400 . Yeah. well. what happened ? Jordan happened . Welcome to the revolution . little lady.Huh ? He 's going to die ! I saw it . He 's going to die . Sweetheart. are you okay ? Did you have a nightmare ? No . I was awake. and I saw it . Tell us what you saw . That man we watched on tv once . What man ? Him . Jordan collier ? Someone 's going to kill him . = YYETS = ... Capture £ ºjohnsonh Sync £ ºp0000000 S02E05 As far as this department knew . maia wasn 't having visions anymore . Right ? Well. she was keeping them secret from me and writing everything down in a diary . but I 'm not here to talk about my daughter . We 're here to talk about collier . We could talk about him all you want . but if I was collier . I 'd be bringing all my books back to the library . If you know what i 'm mean . The kid 's never wrong. right ? Look. as far as I can tell . maia has two kinds of visions . If she can see an event clearly enough in her head . she can sometimes influence the course of the future . But mostly her visions are abstract . They 're more like ... certainties . Prophecies . I guess you could call them . Now. this is one of those . and as far as I can tell . they 're never wrong . Well. not yet. anyway . but nobody 's made a concerted effort to stop one of them from happening . So we could always offer collier a suite in the basement . 24-hour surveillance . and a food taster . Sure. we just tell the guy he needs to stay isolated for what . a week ? A year ? When it comes to the prevention of future crime . there are no time limits - and everyone 's a suspect . I mean. literally everyone . So how to stop the inevitable from happening ? Stopping the inevitable ... isn 't that what we deal with every day ? I mean. that 's why the 4400 were sent back. right ? I like the " can-do " attitude . but I have to ask ... do we even want to save collier ? Well. he is kind of the bad guy . Maybe that 's the way the future wants it . Unless they gave us this message as a way to stop collier 's death from happening . Fascinating . What an extraordinary gift . You are clear on what we 're telling you ? Your daughter has quite a track record when it comes to seeing the future . Her latest vision involves my death . I leave anything out ? No. that about covers it . Ntac is offering you all its resources . That means round-the-clock protection.threat assessment and I 'm meant. of course. to isolate myself ? Well. that would be the safest move . Let 's say I 'm willing to assume good faith on your part which . given your exploitation of the 4400 to get to me. is rather generous ... what. you think we made this up ? I 'm not sure you 're that creative . but your plan does call for my total withdrawal from the public eye and cancellation of a celebration of the public interest in the 4400 that 's been months in the planning . Our history with each other is what it is . but this is real . and denial is not a luxury you can afford . Thank you for the information . I 'll keep it in mind . Maia is never wrong . Whatever protection you can afford me . I can afford myself . Pick up some of the reunion literature on your way out . The foreign returnees ' stories are particularly inspirational . Still come here every thursday. huh ? Thought I might get lucky . Lily . What are you doing here ? I 'm back in seattle . I just wanted to thank you for helping richard . Just a couple of phone calls . It was no big deal . We were in a bad spot . You did what you could . It meant a lot . Well. you really didn 't have to get me anything . It 's actually for heidi . Her birthday 's coming up . Oh.lily ... it 's just a cool little handbag . You don 't have to tell her it 's from me . I don 't want to mess with your life. brian . I 'm just trying to say " thank you . " Okay . You 're looking well.lily. I 'm glad things are working out . I can 't talk to first keys today . There 's too much going on with this party . But class starts in 10 minutes . I can 't do it. lucy . You 're just going to have to tell them to think of it as a study hall . Um ... this is outgoing . Thank you . You guys come for the tour ? Could we talk to you outside ? Kind of a bad day . It 's pretty crazy around here . Told you he 'd blow us off . What 's up ? Oh. liv . They were too embarrassed to come inside . I can 'T . I can 'T . But I saw what you can do . We all did . You can heal people . Listen. it 's not that simple . I can 't heal everyone . I 'm not asking you to heal everyone . Just them . You don 't understand . It 's like it drains me . I can do it for maybe one. maybe . One is better than none . And who chooses that one. way ? You ? Me ? I can 't heal the world . I 'm sorry . What 'd I tell you ? Waste of time ... don 't look at me like that . Kyle ? Hey.you with us. buddy ? What ? I thought you were ... you know. elsewhere . No . I 'm right here with you . was just thinking . Relax . I haven 't had one of those blackouts in a couple of days . I 'm hoping that 's all done . Yeah . I do too . But I still think you should tell your dad about it and get yourself checked out . You want to go with me to see the kills ? Okay. so we 're ignoring the whole blackout thing. or ... pretty much . They go on at 8 : 00 . You should come . The tsa is putting a flag on ian dravitt and his known associates . They 'll call us if anyone shows up in seattle . This whole dravitt thing is just collier 's latest deal gone south . Collier had his name on the side of a skyscraper by the time he was 30 . You pursue power that ruthlessly. you pick up some enemies along the way . So we find the one who seems most like john hinckley or sirhan sirhan . And then do what ? Follow him around for the rest of his natural life ? We could spend the next year looking at collier 's moves since he founded the center . The guy had a whole career before he got abducted . Or maybe it is coming from someone who collier 's never met . I mean. if you hate the 4400 . killing their figurehead 's a good way to make them suffer . But what are we supposed to do ? The potential victim has refused our help . No one said stopping the future was going to be easy . Diana. look at this . His name is miles quinlan . Claims collier bankrupted him . then kicked him out of the center . Lives with his parents What . nursing a persecution complex ? Pretty much a poster boy for the lone gunman theory . Come on. maia . I 've named every guy I 've dated for like the last five years . Are you telling me I don 't have a future with any of them ? I wouldn 't worry about it . Seems like you meet a lot of boys . Yeah. well.that 's the trouble . I 'm tired of meeting boys . I want to meet a man . You will . When ? Aunt april . just because I don 't see it doesn 't mean it 's not going to happen . Oh. that 's probably mrs . Bradshaw from upstairs . She 's going to watch you tonight while I go to work . I 'm sorry . It 's not my fault . You recognize me . You 're jordan collier . I didn 't mean to frighten her . I just wanted to talk to her for a minute . Yeah. well. doesn 't look like that 's going to happen . She believes I 'm going to die . Please give her my apologies . I brought this for her . I hope she doesn 't already have one . Thanks . Hi . I 'm lily tyler . - I think someone was asking for me - - excuse me . Heidi ... are you my mother ? I heard them fighting about you . My mom and dad ... carol . It 's okay that I still call her " mom . " right ? I know it 's confusing. baby . Just ' cause they 're talking in the other room doesn 't mean I can 't hear them . They said you were one of the 4400 . That 's why I was gone . That 's why we don 't know each other . Didn 't you come to our house once ? It 's the first thing I did when I got back . I wanted to see you . But your dad and I. we weren 't sure it was a good idea . Sweetie. does your father know you came down here ? No . I didn 't tell them I heard . I didn 't go to school today . I came here instead . I 'm glad you did . Was it hard for you not to see me ? It was the hardest thing I 've ever had to do . I think about you every single day . Look at this . Is that me ? That was the day we brought you back from the hospital . You look the same as you do now . I was gone so long.but ... to me ... this feels like yesterday . You want to talk about collier ? He uses people up and leaves them on the curb . Is that why you left the center ? I didn 't leave . They threw me out . That 's what happens when you run out of money . They have all these different levels . They call them keys. right ? You make seventh key. you 're unlocked . " Unlocked " - meaning you 've got your own 4400 ability ? Well. that 's the big prize. only they set it up so no one ever gets there . There 's mid-levels and side seminars you have to pass . If you 're not one of the 4400. each one costs . First I ate up my savings . then I cashed out the equity in my house . And they didn 't deliver . Soon as the first check bounced . they told me I 'd reached maximum potential and sent me on my way . Is that why you applied for a handgun permit ? We ran a vicap check on you this morning . So I bought a gun . So what ? I need to protect myself from collier . Yeah. well . I hope self-defense is all you have in mind . because if you 're planning anything else . we will be all over you the minute you approach the 4400 center . You want something to be paranoid about ? Think about that . You 're simplifying the issue . Canceling the gala is no guarantee of my safety . It 's a start . Jordan. you just told me there 's a little girl out there who can see the future and she saw you dead . It 's time to make yourself scarce . And where does it stop ? Do I stay away from the center ? I cut myself off from our work ? Yeah. if it means staying alive . I am not going to become a hermit . That is not a win for us . Look. the center is significantly safer than it seems . Half the people you see in workmen 's uniforms are bodyguards . Are you looking to die in public ? You 're developing a real flair for drama . you know . This is hanging over my head. not yours . Look . I 'm sorry. jordan.I 'm just ... I am not ready to become a martyr . And you don 't have to be . I know you 've been looking forward to this weekend for a long time . Bringing all the 4400 together . it 's like a validation for everything you 've done so far . But if something happens to you . it could undo everything that we 've started . The movement 's not ready for you to be a martyr.either. Just go . Go . Where 'd you go ? I was about to have them page you . Richard. there 's someone I want to introduce to you . This is my daughter . heidi . She came to the center to meet me . We 've been talking . Well . it 's very nice to meet you . I 'm richard tyler.I 'm married to lily ... your mother . She told me . It 's nice to meet you. too . Is that ... isabelle . This is your half-sister . Don 't be scared . I 'm sorry . She must be hungry . It 's okay . I should probably get home anyway . Well . I hope I can see you again . I hope so. too . Maybe next time I can hold isabelle . I bet we could make that happen . I 'll walk you out . No more cutting school. okay ? What 's the matter ? All I 'm saying is he was taller than I pictured him . Well. tall or short. collier had no business showing up here . I totally agree . Di . I didn 't let him in . Aunt april likes tall boys . Oh . So you 're talking about men to my daughter ? She 's a child . It might have come up in passing . Hey. mom ? How come you never go out on dates ? Well . I wouldn 't say never . But aunt april Goes out all the time . Well . I think your aunt 's an extreme example . How do I know which one is right ? Not many or lots ? I think that you should probably shoot for somewhere in the middle . I 'll try . But do dates always have to be with boys ? They 're so gross . You get used to them . Can we have this conversation . like in two or three . maybe 10 years ? What 's that ? Oh . A lady dropped it off today . Oh It 's a subpoena . What 's that ? Well. it 's when someone wants you to give them something . Who 's it from ? It 's from my bosses . What do they want ? Your diary . Kyle ! You okay. man ? You didn 't have a drink. did you ? Just diet coke . It 's really loud in there. huh ? Yeah. but they 're great. huh ? You want to go back in ? Come on . My buddy 's saving us a spot by the stage . Do you know what time it is ? What are you doing here ? Kyle ! Do you know what time it is ? What are you doing outside my apartment ? I don 't know . I was at the pub . You 're scaring me . How long have you been out here ? I don 't know ... I think I was digging or something . Look. kyle . I think you should go . - We can talk about this - - I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to scare you . It just happened again . Let me in . Get your hands off of me ! You don 't understand . He 's a fraud . All of you. do you hear me ? Your golden boy is a big fraud . Liv. you need to calm down . It 's okay. guys . I got it . My whole life . I have been looking for just one thing . just one thing to believe in . I thought it was you . How long ago did you get high ? You gonna help me up. or what ? Are you going to stop yelling at me ? I am done with you altogether . Go back to your penthouse . Pretend we don 't exist . Everyone else does . Why not you ? Listen ... easy . I 'm not going to sen d youoff into the night like this . You can sleep on my couch . I got you . It 's okay . You started all this. you know . Everything around you took shape after you showed me where to go . I don 't know what to do. though . I could count the number of times I 've said that on one hand . but right now it 's true . That 's right . If you know anything ... now would be a good time to tell uncle jordan. huh ? Oh ... thank you . Thank you . The reunion goes forward . Diana . One of dravitt 's hired guns flew into town last night . His name is laurent ganning . Tsa had his alias flagged . Well. do we have a present whereabouts ? He just checked into a motel in first hill under the name " lawrence gawain " It 's clear . Tom ... he 's on the move . Wendy. wait . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . You were waiting in the hallway outside my apartment last night . Do you know how weird that is ? I don 't know how I got there . Please. believe me.I-I ... I had another blackout last night . Look. kyle. this is getting bad . and I can 't give you the kind of help that you need . So you want me to just go away ? No . I ... I want you to talk to someone . someone qualified . I 'm scared for you . Scared for me or scared of me ? And we are humbled by the bravery of our foreign guests . many of whom risked so much to be here today ... you know. glen . I 'm getting some nasty echos . Can we adjust the levels on the speakers in the back ? Testing. testing . one. two.three.Testing. You know. that 's a lot better . Nobody moves ! Everyone stay right where you are . Don 't move . Don 't move ! Get your hands on your head . Get them up . Turn around . Turn around ! Get down. down . Down ! Ganning 's pistol was made from synthetic polymers . The bullets. too . He walked it right through your metal detectors without so much as a peep . You were Round to get him . He never would have killed me . He was standing two feet away from you with a loaded firearm . The whole thing was put in motion by maia . Your daughter 's vision was a gift to me . a prescription. if you will . for changing the future . In one chain of events . ganning 's bullet killed me . I can only assume that somebody has a different plan for me . Well . I wouldn 't be putting my feet up by the fire just yet . I have no intention of canceling the extra security measures . The same extra measures that just allowed an assassin to walk right up to you . Would ntac like a presence at the gala tomorrow ? Yes . Mr. Collier. we don 't stand off to the side and watch . We take command . I 'll issue credentials . That was a rather dramatic demonstration of competence just now . What time is it ? It 's about 2 : 00 . How 'd I end up here. anyway ? Liv. you were pretty far gone last night . but are you really telling me you don 't remember ? I remember . You don 't have to hover over me . I 'm not going to steal anything . The maid can come in and clean the couch as soon as I 'm gone . How many of these nights do you think you have left in you ? Hopefully not too many . You 've seen my life . When I O.D .. It 's not gonna be any big loss . That is not true . How 's it going to change ? I used to feel the same way . I meant what I told you . I can 't save the whole world . and I can 't even save your friends . and I 'm sorry . but if you 're serious about wanting a change . maybe I can save you . How ? By giving you the same thing that saved me . He 's here . hi.Good to see you . Excuse me . Hello. my love . Here we go . I think I have to ... nice to meet you Pleasure to see you . Excuse me. sir . All the guestscheck out so far . Yeah. we secured the surrounding rooftops. did a bomb sweep . So now it 's cross-our-fingers time . Yeah . Good afternoon . Thank you for coming to the center . We have a great day planned for you . but before we get started . I 'd like to thank the man that made this all possible . I mean that literally - he didn 't just pay for the food . He built this place . and this movement . so I 'd like you to please welcome my mentor . my friend - mr . Jordan collier . Thank you . and thank you. shawn . for that introduction . We are humbled by the bravery of our foreign guests . many of whom risked so much to be here today . Let 's go . I just want to hear what the man has to say for himself . Jordan ? He 's up there ! Go ! Everybody stay down ! we 've got a shooter . Everyone calm down ! Just stay down . Stay down ! We 've got a shooter . Let me go . Jordan ! Oh. my god ! Oh.god ... please let me go. please ! get that stretcher ready . Pulse is weak and thready come on let 's go harry up ! Breathing 's stopped . We 're losing him again . No ! You 're not going anywhere yet . shawn ! She told me to go through with it . Who did ? She lies . No ... don 't go anywhereno ... - Lily.I need to - - brian . I don 't have much time . I did not violate our agreement . Heidi found me . Lily . heidi 's sick . She 's in the hospital . It happened yesterday . Something with her spleen . They had to operate right away . Is she okay ? Can I see her ? She 's okay . She 's still recovering from the anesthesia . She 's been asking for you . She 's still in recovery now . but carol thinks it 's all right if you want to get in there tomorrow . Brian. what happened ? Her spleen ? She 's 12 years old . It just ruptured . Her doctors said they 've never seen anything like it . Even they can 't tell us why . Where you been ? The funeral 's about to start . Lily. what 's wrong ? What is it ? Heidi 's sick . and I think isabelle 's responsible . I think they 're ready for you . You are going to read a lot about jordan collier in the next few weeks . some of it good . a lot of it bad ... I will be ignoring all of it . just like jordan would have . because jordan may have used the media . but he never allowed himself to be seduced by it . I could tell you how much I owe the man . He took me in when I was feeling lost and alone. confused . I 'm sure many of you have similar stories . The fact is that everyone alive today . whether they know it or not. owes jordan collier . He had a vision to save the future . and he gave us that vision . and now he won 't be here to see us achieve it ... but we will achieve it . I promise you. we will achieve it . We have all suffered a tremendous loss . We are heartbroken and bleeding on the inside . but we will not let that stop us . and I will not let that stop me . We will honor jordan collier . and we will create the better future that he died building . Thank you for coming . Goodbye . Nice words. shawn . I think collier would have approved . Yeah . I hope so . He would have liked that you came . Oh . I don 't think I was that high on his radar . Don 't be too sure . You guys bumped heads . but you believed the same thing . that the 4400 are the key to the future . Your goals were identical . But our methods were different . Not as different as you think . See. that 's where your view of jordan collier splits from mine . Well. at least we have some common ground . Maybe your side and my side can work together now that I 'm assuming new duties around here . You 're becoming quite the little politician. shawn . Now I know collier would have been proud of you . He 's gone . is body. it 's not there . Someone stole the body . There 's only one way out . and we were standing right in front of it . Stole it how ? Then what happened ? All lying across the ground try not to make no sound to make or break you down I said to make or break you down I break all lying across the ground try not to make no sound to make or break you down I said to make or break you down I break I take down what I need 'cause you know I need to breathe I 'm tired of walking on another plane another plane ' cause I feel insane I step back to get to you cut back I 'm falling through another day I feel the same I 'm cutting and I 'm bleeding here with you

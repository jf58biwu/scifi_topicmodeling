 Blue ... It 's ... Blue ... " The Cold Hour " My name is Jesus . I am 10 years old . In truth I am only 8 , but Judas said ... I 'm mature for my age . I will tell our story , that of each . One by one . This is Pablo and that is Maria . They love each other very much . They are always like this , touching . Thats disgusting ! Jesus , leave us alone , OK ? Pablo , dont scream . You know what time it is ? Come on , get going . - Go to bed ! - OK . Now we will see another neighbor . Here are Lucas and Mateo . They are ... like Pablo and Maria ... Always trying to touch . It is better to let them sleep . This is Magdalena . She is an astronomer . And she is Ana . It is as if she 's my sister , but really is not my sister . She is beautiful , eh ? I think she is very beautiful . Before , I slept with them ... but not anymore . Because Ana said she is getting older . Pedro is a soldier . Jesus ... go to sleep . OK . Pedro was the leader . But not anymore . Maria is now the leader . I love that Maria is the chief . Pedro was the love of Maria . Not anymore . Jesus , wake up , it 's 8 oclock . It 's not fair ... just a little more , if you dont mind - ... I 'll just fall asleep . Time for breakfast . And I don 't want to repeat myself . And now it 's your turn to shower ! Okay , okay , do not yell . - Come ... Hello champion ! - Hello . Hello . Mateo ? You 're done now , right ? Always eggs ! Imagine a steak . just shut up and eat , they are healthy . We 'll go see Judas . I don 't like you going there . Come on , Mom ? It 's Judas . We wont go anywhere else . They 're kids . - They need to stay busy . - They are my responsibility . That of all , Magda . OK , OK . Spare me the Preaching . Mom , will you tell Jesus not to film me ? honey , let him . it 's how he entertains himself . - What can it hurt ? - I hate it . Jesus , you heard Ana . she doesn 't want you to film her . Alright . Imbcile . - Girl . - Girl . Good , it 's done . - It 's time for class , lets go ? - Yes . - You should also begin . - It is Friday . mind your business is that just me . - Damn ! - Jesus , your vocabulary ! I 'll wash your mouth with soap ... Get your business underway . It 's good , I 'll ... - In addition , Champion . - A + . Come on , come on . Are you worried for Pedro ? He 's been like this for weeks . he stops as well . We can not be hiding from each other all day . No I think he can not stand that I give him orders . Mateo would be better at dealing with it . - So what do we do ? - What do I know ? I have to go to class . We 'll talk later . Listen , you okay ? Now were going . Math . It 's boring . But Maria is nice . She explains much . She says we must learn all these things ... because if we learn it now , it will be useful someday . Maria says that math is good , and everything . But I think not . We 'll continue with decimal divisions , okay ? Don 't look at me like that .. I know you have mastered it . Yes , yes , but they scare me . Go , don 't be silly . MA-GNI-TUD-ES . - Mateo ? - Yes ? When will we talk about war ? This is not the time Ana . It happens . Lets continue . Magnitudes directly proportional . - Back in 2 hours . - Okay . - I bet you can 't catch me . - Wanna bet ? Wait up , don 't go so fast ! We shouldn 't let them out alone Come on , woman . Let them forget all this for a bit .. And Ana takes responsibility for Jesus . I love when she calls me " Mom " . That Judas . Trying to put crazy ideas in thier heads . I don 't like his kind . Well them , they love it . I hate this part . Asshole ! - What if we went this way ? - No . We must follow the rules . - It is a forbidden zone . - But it 's annoying . - Dont go there . - Wait . - What are you doing ? - It 's for the child . Magda said we shouldn 't do that , Jesus . Ok , lets go . Judas ! Judas it 's us ! Open ! Enter . I didn 't expect you so soon . We finished the course early . - Yes . - How 's it going up there ? - Same as always . And the camera , Jesus ? It works very well . Thank you . If you need more tapes , I found a crock full , OK ? OK . - And you 're more beautiful every day , huh ? - Thanks . I found something for you yesterday . Wow ! It 's makeup and stuff like that . Some are a little dry , but Magdalena ... - ... will you put them back into condition . - Thank you . Well , how long can you stay today ? 2 hours . Good - ! it gives us time to see a movie , right ? - Great ! Come ! Hello children . Your parents want you to understand ... the standards we must follow ... nuclear posture in case of attack of the enemy . The enemy is evil , and he wants to kill us all . But we can defend ourselves . You scared me , Idiot . What do you want ? My head is killing me . I can 't take it anymore . Please ... There remains very little sedation . I can not make exceptions . Maria , I 'm serious , I 'm really hurting . It 's not possible . Sorry . The floor is a safe place ... but the walls and houses can collapse . We shall overcome . For you ! For the future ! But we must protect it . Cover our eyes and cover us . That 's it , kids . I have only this film . what was it like outside ? With all those buildings and machines ? Yes , sir . The cars drove themselves , we had the house robots . Soon , we can go back ? One day ... Tell us more about the war ? What 's going on ? You never speak of the war ? No , he never talks about it . Magdalena said that when I grow up , I could see the sea .. the sky and beaches . Yes ? They 're still here . Sorry , we didn 't notice what time it was . OK . kids , they 're calling for you . you should hurry home . Next time I 'll tell you more about the war . - OK ? - OK . Be careful , eh ? - Bye . - Bye . - What was that - I don 't know . - We can 't get past it . - Wait . The video camera can see better than us . - Look , look ! - Damn ! That 's the child . The lonely child . - He 's scared . - Sure he 's scared . He 's all alone here . He 's like an animal . The light scares him . It 's best to leave . Magda will kill us . - Ana ? - What ? - You 'll protect me today , right ? - You can count on me . The thing is uh , .. that I want to protect you . - What ? - Well ... I want to marry you and I always want to protect you . But anyway , you 're a kid . It is I who Protects you , brat . Come on , lets go . I told you two hours and you have taken 3 . Judas took good care of us . Judas ! God in heaven ! He can hardly walk . Tomorrow you get your punishment . Please , mama . We saw films of robots , and he told us things . Stories , etc . ... It wont happen again , I swear . Look what Judas gave me . - What is it ? - Old makeup . It is a bit dry , but with a little water it 's okay , no ? - What ? - Nothing . - You know it 's my room ? - And that of Magdalena . Yes , because we are women . Go to your room kid , go . Hi , Champion . - Bad day or what ? - A little ... Say , you lend it to me now ? - Come on , be a sport . - The price has increased . The tapes are hard to find . Damn ! You can act like an adult when it suits you , right ? - What do you want ? - I want ... I want all of your desserts for a week . - OK ... - Okay , okay ! - will you lend it to me ? - OK . Thank you buddy . I 'll give it back tomorrow . - Hi Chief . - Honey , I 'm exhausted . C 'mon , just a kiss . You shouldn 't borrow Jesus 's camera . I 'm not . It 's bribery . It 's good to be home . Don 't stop , don 't stop . Relax , relax , relax . - Jesus , breakfast ! - I 'm coming . You want the camera ? You want the camera ? C 'mon , it 's time for breakfast . Breakfast ! If I were an adult during the war I would save Ana . And she would have loved me . Just like in Judas 's comics . Where you kill strangers and enemies . I 'm being protective , but she doesn 't notice ... Because she is very proud ... And also , I am almost his age . If she doesn 't love me back , I 'd go with the lonesome child . I am sure he is happy with lots of corridors to wander . ... Happy with lots of corridors to wander ? Damn ! Don 't quit ! Don 't stop ! You 're late , Jesus . - Did you leave the tape in the camera . - Damn ... Jesus , you didn 't ... ! ? - You give me that ? - Jesus ! C 'mon , give me the tape . your dessert for the next six months . You 're like a little gangster , you know ? OK agree , agree , agree ! - You swear ? - Yes , I swear . And not a word to Maria . Or she 'd kill us both ! - Not me . - Oh yes , you too . you two , stop it ! It 's done . Enough ! Kids ! It 's not a good idea that the kids attend the meetings . The more they know about our situation ... the better . You 're beautiful . Catch me ! Stop ! Well Ana , you 're made up very beautiful . We are all here now , so I 'll come to the point . latest update , the power has been fluctuating , suggesting that someone ... Controls the generators from somewhere . Right now , the tap-water is drinkable , except it ocassionally becomes a little muddy . Judas analyzes it every two days , to be sure it 's okay for drinking . But we are starting to run out of food and medicine . We have no antibiotics , sedatives or vitamins . There is almost nothing left . Then we 'll have to go , right . We must try to reach the storage . We know about 10 % of this area . We can all stay here and die of botulism . I need medicine for my head . The last time we went out , I was this close to a into a stranger . - I don 't like the idea , OK ? - Good . But Maria is right . We need food before it 's too late . The storage is not far away and we can go underground . No need to leave for the surface . In addition , there may be other groups like ours ... In the same situation , who don 't dare leave their hiding place . If we go , we are more likely to find them . Votes for going ? Jesus , your vote won 't count , you 're a child . And yours either . You must be 18 years . The motion is approved . Who goes will be chosen later . Magda ... - You got a minute ? - Of course . How cold are the hours ? Increasing . Today it has one . Pedro has found one of the hens frozen . Prepare for a curfew at 8 PM . We should get together and make plans . - After dinner . - Thank you . " Oh yes , darling , don 't stop ... " Stop being an idiot , mosquito . We have an agreement . Good god , you 're a bastard . You know ? Ana ! But the radiation will destroy them quickly . I 'll send this expedition . - Okay . - You are the most experienced . Soon the signal will end ? It must have an automatic transmitter . I guess it will continue running until the batteries die . In their sinister laboratory ... where they experiment on POW 's ... dissected alive , they were able to develope ... Blood type A virus ... To convert people into channels of contagion ... Without killing them . The virus destroys the brain ... Causes hemorrages throughout the body . - Shit . - And put people in a vegetative state . They are children of a whore . Come , Pablo , let it be . Forget it . I 'll spend the night with Magda . We will plan the expedition . Great . Here , we see how they keep a dogs head alive ... This head is then transplanted ... Why are you taking notes ? I 'm writting in case something happens to us . And again , here I will write ... What it takes for you to find what you 'll need one day if I don 't come back ? Tell me your name , your age and your function . My name is Pablo , I 'm 30 and I studied architecture ... But now I cook for you , kid . What do you want me to say ? Will you tell me about the war ? - You were a hero ? - What is a hero ? The heroes are in your comic book kid . You must promise me one thing . If you some day find new friends . You have to let them read this . It 's 8 o 'clock ! The cold hour ! Confinement until 7 o 'clock in the morning ! From now on it is forbidden to leave the room . All rooms must be locked . She 's really lucky . She fell asleep immediately . They will try to bring back sleeping pills tomorrow . They really help me . Look . If this exit is blocked ... they can enter through here . They 'll be near the storage . I think they 'll be gone 4 or 5 hours . There were no plans for tomorrow , right ? No , it 's a quiet day , ideal for an expedition . Hello . The cold hours are starting . It means that we can freeze , so they lock us in our rooms . Or the invisibles can enter and kill you . Me , what I do is crawl under the blanket . Then , if they come , they don 't see me . It 's like a ghost , but more scary . And nobody knows what they are . Before , we put everybody in the same room during cold hour . But they are attracted by the warmth of too many people . It 's better to be few in each room . Damn ! I hate this ! I hate it ... I wonder how the lonely child is ? If we 're scared here , he must be really scared Really bad . Hello everyone ! Report on cold hour ! We are all accounted for . The expedition leaves this morning with Pedro , Pablo and Lucas . They are more fit , they can carry more supplies . This does not feel right ... - You okay ? - Just great . Somebody has to do it , right ? I have a bad feeling . - How is our ammunition ? - not good , we only have 50 bullets left . Good luck . It 's 10 o 'clock . We expect you back in 2 or 3 hours . Good . Judas ? You hear me ? We just launched a sortie . If all goes well , they will go past your room soon . - OK . - Call me if somthing happens to them . Thank you . Good . here we go , to the north . THE FINAL WAR You hear that ? Steps . It 's over there , 3000 meters to the storage . As long as they stay away . Go . This way . Hello children . Your parents want you to understand ... The rules we 're meant to follow all ... In case of nuclear attack by the enemy . The enemy is evil , they want to kill us all . But we can defend ourselves . seems secure . Don 't believe it . They could be anywhere . Three minutes , eh ? Silence , idiot ! Ah ! Damn ! - Lucas , we gotta go . - What is it ? - You okay ? - Yes , it 's nothing . I saw one . - Pablo saw one . Here we go . - I must get some ammunition . We don 't have time , damn it ! There 's no time ! - Pablo , I don 't like this . - We 'll talk when we get back . - What 's going on ? - Where are we ? 200 meters from the storage . Did you hear that ? They are above us ? They have noticed us , here we go . - where are you going ? - Over there . - The area is infected . - No time . Pedro ! Damn , we can 't see anything . Quiet ! You want them all to wake up ? Damn ! Damn ! Damn ! Where have you brought us ? Into the lion 's den ? Dirty son of a bitch ! Bastard ! Pedro ! Pedro ! Pedro ! What 's going on ? Where is Pablo ? Get in there ! Damn ! Cover me , I 'll get him . Are you crazy ? If you go in , they will kill you both . We gotta get outta here . Pablo ! Pablo ! There 's nothing we can do . We need to get out of here . Let 's go . Lucas ! lets go ! Judas ! Good God ! What happened ? He went into a room full of strangers . We couldn 't do anything to help him . In this situation , you don 't stand a chance . It 's better to shoot yourself . More than half of the building is infested with strangers ! it was bound to happen . We should not go into the forbidden zones . You should not have gone that way ! Damn ! I want a Statement by each of you . Separately . Magda , I put you in charge . This is a warning . - How are you ? - Just so ... More ... chickens died . Again ? Another cursed confinement . - Another night of shit . I 'm tired ! - Yes ... The Invisibles are very active these days . How is Lucas ? Lucas ? He 's locked himself in the observatory . He says he wants to be alone . He feels guilty for what happened . Remember when this place was all full of people and children ? Just barely . - When this was a shopping center . - Yes . One would think that centuries have passed . How long ago ? 9 years ? One day , the generators will quit , and we will die . We can 't think that everything will end . There may still be people outside . Just cause we can 't find them doesn 't mean they don 't exist . This place is very big . There is no one left , you know . We 're on the run for years , there is almost no ... Non-contaminated areas . It 's a mistake , Mateo . We are like the politicians that brought us all this . If the children survive and grow up ... they 'll never forgive us . Very well . We can do something . We kill the children and then have a party . Is that a good option to you ? Maria , why are you with Pablo ? Why did you get together ? Because we love each other very much , and we love be together . We love each other and ... we 've known each other since long ago and ... it looks like things are going well between her and me . This is stuff for when you 're older . I 'll tell you about it . Monday Pablo is now dead . I liked Pablo . I liked to think that my father was like him . He ended up in a room full of strangers . Looks like there are now more Invisibles . They are in the corridor . So I whisper . Mateo ! Mateo ! I implore you , open up ! Mateo ! You 're crazy ! ? I 'm afraid . Those things could have killed you . You put us all in danger , you are very selfish . Stay with me ! Motionless . Stay still so they don 't see you . Remain motionless . Mateo ? Look at me . Hello , kid . - What 's going on ? - Ana ! - she 's not in her room ! - What ? When I woke up , she was not there ! Everybody ! Get up ! Ana ! The girl has disappeared ! Calm down ! She is with me . Ana ! She came in the middle of the night . She said she was afraid . Are you crazy ? During cold hour ? You could have died ! We gather here to say farewell to our friend Pablo . He was , for all of us an example to follow . A good person and honest ... Which aids us in difficult times . We live in hard times ... We are torn from the things we love . That 's why , nevertheless , we must move forward . Because staying alive is the only thing we have left . Maria , can we go with Judas ? It would be good for recreation . Please . Only 2 hours . Of course . He was a good guy . I know . It must be hard . He was liked here . The Strangers are like zombies , huh ? Not exactly . They are sick . They have a virus that kills them slowly , you know ? Their skin falling off , they bleed everywhere . And if they touch you , they infect you . Weapons were infected by the enemy to annihilate us . My parents were killed by strangers , right ? . And who has told you that ? Pablo . Pablo told me that . And your parents ? Is it the stranger who has nothing ? No , Jesus , no . I 've lived a long time . My parents died long ago , during a great war . they were killed by the same people that put this number on my arm . They were bad people , But we beat them . And then we all promised there would be no more wars . But adults , you see , we 're running out of memory ... My God ! The Stranger took my room ... Magda ! Pablo ! Shit ... Mateo ! Atrocities were committed by gangs . The enemy and ourselves . We filled the cities of our enemies ... with experimental diseases . used bombs that reduced people to ashes . Why don 't they want us to know these things ? They are afraid . They do not want you to suffer . They became obsessed with certain things . So I decided to live here . I feel better alone . Who was the enemy ? The enemy ? ... It was half the world against the other . We fought because we thought that our god ... Was better than theirs . But they thought the same thing of their god . You understand ? What is god ? Someone who has abandoned us . Time to return . Not a word to anyone . Adults get alarmed fast . I want you to swear . - I swear . - I swear . You gave me food . What does he mean , Jesus ? When going to see Judas , I always took him some food . I felt sorry that he was alone . Why didn 't you say you knew about this child ? I thought you would say he was a stranger and kill him . But anyway , Jesus he 's a child . He might have died of starvation or worse . - Sorry . Well , - Forget about it . We spoke of Strangers . They are home and they stayed there . They arrived this morning . and decided to stay In that area just lives some guy ? According to him , they are 70m Securing our area . They were right on us . You can not go anywhere . It 's the only area that remains unaffected . We need to get out . There are thousands of strangers out there . It would be suicide . - We need to clear this area . - When ? as soon as possible . Every second counts . All adults , come . I can not stay with you . You 'll have to watch over Jesus and this kid . - What is his name ? - I do not know . Make sure he gets a shower . The child stinks And you put them to bed at 8 . We will try to return by midnight , okay ? Everyone in the room and no question of going out in the hallway ! - Mom . - What , honey ? Don 't get killed . Do not worry . And tell Mateo that I love him . - Son of a bitch ! - H , ho ! What is it ? This bastard has slept with Ana . What ? - What did she tell you ? - Enough . Look , what 's the problem ? Ana did nothing wrong , she 's almost an adult ... Nothing happened . She just slept here . Continue with her and I 'll blow your brains out , stupid bastard . I swear to you that nothing happened . Go , damn ! Don 't waste anymore time ! We can 't lose more time ! Let 's see if we can kill something . It will really help us ? Looks like they are all crazy . Why have you so many things in your room ? Well ... It 's that I love recycling ... Objects that are apparently useless , you know ? Or to disassemble , and I will repair some of it . But above all , because here we have a lot of free time ... And we must take care , and that concerns me greatly . Why should I go to class every day ? Because you are a child and you have to . Why are you still reading these romance novels ? Because I love them . It may seem silly to you , but not to me . You will understand when you grow up . Besides , why don 't you go read you a story ? I have things to do . Clear ! Clear ! - What you got ? - Nothing . It works ? It 's always the same thing . But sometimes there ' s cartoons . And the person is found skinned , Unable to do anything , apart from spreading the virus . In this horrible secret document we got from the ememy ... We see them conduct experiments , cutting animals . Here we see them keep alive the head of a dog ... spare his body . This head is then transplanted ... to a human body . The result is a monstrosity ... Which survives only a few hours . That is how they want to transform us .. But our nuclear forces will destoy them in a few weeks . We will avenge our dead . Stop that , I 'm afraid . Do not cry . - It 's wrong . - It is wrong to cry ? Magdalena said that crying , makes you dehydrated ... And then you drink more , and there 's not so much water . She doesn 't want people to cry . Do not touch him , or he will infect you . Run , go , run ! Pablo ? It 's no longer Pablo ! Kill this thing ! Beware ! Careful Mateus ! Sorry . It 's not that hard . Run , run ! . Run , now ! Jesus , run ! Come ! Run ! Do not touch him ! The stranger has infected him . - But I 'm alright Ana . - Do not come near us ! Ana , I beg you , I have nothing ! You are one of them . If they do not kill you , you will become like them ! Children , how are you ? Has something happened to you ? A stranger has touched Jesus . - God Almighty ! - Oh my God ! He 's one of those creatures . - Wait . - Jesus , son , you alright ? - Did it touch you ? - It grabbed my arm ... It 's a matter of time ! And he would have died . It must be something else . It may be that Jesus is immune . Come on son , come . Do not worry , come . Thats right . Come here . Be quiet . So , calm yourself son , calm yourself ... We should barricade the corridor . All these bodies are dangerous . Do they become strangers when they die ? Nobody knows . We are avoiding the most important issue . You know that the child will be a problem . Jesus ? You speak of Jesus ? He has a name , you know ? He has a high fever and delerium . The kids do not want to get too close to him . - Neither do I , until I 'm sure ... - Exactly . The RULES are RULES and they all apply . If a stranger touches you , you have to die . It is possible that this child will save us all . It has always been so . If he 's immune , it can guarantee our survival . That 's all very well . But imagine that he gets up at night and infects us all . Or at this very moment is infecting Ana and the child . You talk about sacrificing a 10 year old child ! Call it what you want . A moment ago you did not have as much remorse . Pedro , we can not do that . The Strangers ... Nuclear power ... Will destroy ... The enemy ... Experiments ... Quiet honey , calm down . - And what 's your name ? - Saulo . Saulo.And your parents , do you know where they are ? Now they 're Strangers , it 's been long since I 've seen them . Before they were out there ... . dripping blood and stuff . They have to die . Will you stay with him for a while ? Come with me ? - where ? - Come on . where are we going ? To a place children can go . I do not sleep very well . So , during the calm nights , without the cold hours ... I come here . I am an astronomer . You know that , right ? We study the Cosmos . I always loved the stars . And here , I can see them . - Can I ? - Sure . These are stars ? Why do they explode ? They do not explode , honey . Those are things that fall from the sky . Up there , there is a kind of thing that protects us . Otherwise , they fall on us . Thank you for bringing me , Mom . I don 't want you to call me Mom . - Please . - But I 'm not your mother , Ana . My mother is dead , I know . it was a stranger that infected her . You told me that . - Was it you who killed her . - How can you think that ? I do not know . On TV , they said that even if it 's a family member ... it 's better to kill them . And Judas said that when we arrived here , we were babies ... And there were many people infected , and she became a stranger . You like them ? They 're nice . You know Mateo died this afternoon , right ? He was touched a Stranger . Ana , did he you touch you last night ? Or try anything ? It was just embrasssing . And we hugged , and then we fell asleep . I think I was in love with him . It felt good . - What are you doing ? - I 'm watching you . She ask me to look after you . - Have you seen my camera ? - Yes , here it is . give it to me ? Careful , do not touch me . Why ? In case you 're making me a stranger . Hello , it 's me again . I am with my friend - Who ... I do not know his name . - Saulo ... Thats right .. well , I 'm here . I 'm sick because I was touched by a stranger . But the adults killed it . And Ana , where is she ? She left with this big girl , Magda . When I heal we will leave here and go out with Judas . To the beach . Blue . It is blue . Monday There is still light and water . If it were the end of the world ... none of this would exist , no ? Nobody knows , my dear girl . They say that nuclear power plants will function ... As long as the uranium remains . And we 'll have uranium for a while . Well , it 's time to rest . Sleep . - I 'm afraid . - Were here with you . Stay calm . Do not worry . So quiet , we are here , okay ? - Okay . - Sleep . As you can see , you 're not the only artist here . They hide , but I hear them breathe . They have lungs filled with blood ... it 's like a clogged pipe . What are you talking about , Pedro ? There are at least a dozen Behind this wall ... Silent , waiting ... In the dark . Waiting to come here to finish us all . And if all this were just an experiment ? Don 't you feel them watching ? They have hidden cameras in every corner . We are guinea pigs , Maria . It is an experiment in behavior . We are being watched . We are in a concentration camp . You saw what happened . Bombs , disease , the dead . You worked with us . How can you think so ? I have to find all the cameras ! there are cameras everywhere ! You understand ? They are in the walls ! They are back here ! They are everywhere ! So you have to come with me . You don 't understand , but it 's for your own good . I love you , Maria . I always have . And I will still save you , as I saved Pablo . - You saved me ? - He was not good for you . I gave him to the Strangers , to save time ... - Now we can get out of here . - Son of a bitch ! What was that ? Courses ? No , not today ... - What time is it ? - Quiet . Let 's go . Let 's go . Dont move ! Do not try anything ! Pedro has gone mad ! Good God ... what have you done ? - Mom ! - Pedro ! Do not move ! I just want the infected child who was touched . Please . These are not people , Judas . Pedro , please . Don 't ruin it all now . What the hell ? Out of here ! Run . Get out of here ! Come on , kids ! Come on ! Go without me ! Come , come ! - I can 't keep going . - yes you can ! We are leaving , let 's go ! Go ! Don 't stop ! It 's here ! We have to help Maria ! We must leave here , there is no other choice ! Run ! Go , go ! Get out ! You too ! Mom , I do not want to leave . Go now ! Leave it , Jesus . it 's no longer important . I need to rest . Nice night , huh ? Yes . There are many stars . Judas , I 'm afraid . Me too , Ana . Me too . Jesus , Saulo , come here , boys . They ... well ... wanted you to grow up away from all this . .. But it was not possible . Jesus , there are no beaches to go to . Not anymore , you know . We thought coming in , it would be temporary ... that we could return some day , but ... I 'm sorry , kids . I 'm sorry . I always loved the stars ... they 're very beautiful ... Hello , champion ... It is good to be home ... If they survive and become adults , these children ... These children will never forgive us . Not a word to anyone ... Adults get scared easily . ... I 'm sorry ... - I bet you can 't catch me . - Want to bet ? Hello , it 's me . I do not hurt anymore and I feel better . The Strangers are all around us ... They 'll change us into creatures like them . it 's probably not so bad . Well , thatt 's the story of my life . I hope one day somebody finds this . - Goodbye . DAY ZERO The End ... Blue ... It 's blue ...

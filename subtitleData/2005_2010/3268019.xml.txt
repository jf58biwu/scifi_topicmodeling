You 're Right , It Isn 't . Why ? Why Is It So Important ? Mozart 's Requiem . He Wrote It Over A Hundred Years Ago . People Still Listen To It . They 'll Listen To It Forever . It 's Our Connection To The Past And The Future . I Don 't Care About Mozart . It 's Just Old . You 're Young , It Probably Seems That Way . But I 've Been Around A While . And I Can Tell You This , Art Links Us Over Time . Everyone Who 's Ever Heard Mozart Or Will Ever Hear It , We 're All Connected . You Understand ? Don 't Know Him . What Else ?

How Certain Things In Your Life , You Wish You 'd Tended To Better ? Thank You . Thank You , Roosevelt , For Being Such A Big Help And Let Me Know If We Need More Wine . Oh , Sacha , Maria , Welcome . We 're Still Setting Up . Let 's Get You Some Wine . Why Don 't You Say Hello To Dutch ? So , Dutch ... I Understand This Is Your Cheering-Up Party . Yeah . Is It Working ? What Do You Think ? Maybe You Should Read The Masses . It 's Going To Change Everything . Change Is Rare And Slow . You Want Change ? You Should Exhibit In My Gallery . It 'd Make It Easier To Get You Into The Armory Show . The Work Isn 't Ready . It Never Is . You 're Going In Some Interesting Directions . Well , I Should Have Arrived By Now . Each Painting Is Worse Than The Last . Now I Paint Out Of Curiosity To See How Bad It Can Get . It Isn 't Bad . It 's Just Stiff . Constrained . It Isn 't Free . Perhaps Like The Artist . Dutch , This Is Alice Crayborn . She 's A Modern Dancer . The Next Isadora . There 's Only One Isadora . And She Has A Very Bad Habit Of Speaking Her Mind . That Could Get You Into Trouble . So I 've Been Told . Any Wine , Dutch ? No , No . So How Would A Dancer Feel About ... Sitting Still ? Looking To Pin The Butterfly ? Hello . I 'm Dutch 's Wife . Samantha . This Is Alice . My New Model . Hey , Sara . I 'm On A New Cell Phone Plan : Unlimited Rejection . We Got A Hit On Your John Doe 's Fingerprints . He 's A Skell ? He Has A Record ? Department Of Education . He Was A Teacher 's Aide . Yeah . A Cop With No Gun . This Is Special Agent Lawson , Fbi . I Can Tell By The Shoes . He 's With The Organized Crime Task Force . I Thought We Agreed , This Is Our Case . It Still Is . But The Rules Of The Game Have Changed . Your Vic 's Name Is Alex Spoor . You May Know His Family . They 've Got A Little Brewery In Brooklyn . Solid New England Stock . Here 's A Sample Of Some Of Their Most Recent Work . A Crime Family . Born And Bred . We 've Had Them Under Investigation For Three Years . Harry Morton , Labor Boss , Garroted In His Car . Elsie Gennaro , 68 . Apparently She Saw Something She Wasn 't Supposed To , Stabbed In The Heart . Yeah , We Get The Picture . If The Chinese Killed Alex Spoor , All Hell 's Gonna Break Loose . A Gang War . I Thought He Was Trying To Become A Teacher . Doesn 't Matter If He Was Studying To Become A Nun . He 's One Of Them . You Can 't Escape Who You Are . Hey , You 're 400 . What You In Training For ? It 's A Release . Of Course , Now That You And Sara Have Done The Deed , Maybe You Are Mortal . In Which Case , You Better Be Careful . Well , If She 's The One , Then Where The Hell Is She ? The Shaman Didn 't Say Much About Voice Mail . What 's The Story With The Dead Kid ? Alex Spoor ? Yeah . Well , It Turns Out He 's Part Of A Violent Crime Family . My Family . Somehow This Branch Went Bad And It Started With Me . Hey , Hey , Hey , Hey ! It 's My Family , Too . People Are People . If I Took Responsibility For Everything You Did , I 'd Never Get Out Of Bed In The Morning . It 's Like , 200 Years Ago You Beat Up Somebody In A Bar . And Today , One Of His Descendants Blows Up A Building . You Can Say It 's Not Your Fault , But You 're Connected To It . It 's The Butterfly Effect . A Butterfly Flaps Its Wings In India , And You Don 't Get Your Wine Shipment . Except With Me , It Happens Over Time . Most People Don 't Live Long Enough To See It . Because We Only Live One Life . One Life Is Just The Blink Of An Eye . So Who Am I Supposed To Be ? In Your Painting ? You 're An Odalisque . What 's That ? She 's A Virgin Slave Girl In A Harem . If An Odalisque Does Well , She Could Become A Concubine . Really . Mmm . Must Be Nice To Be King . Sultan . How 's The Work ? Fine . You Need Anything ? No . My God . This Is Really Extraordinary . I Was Going To Make Lunch . I Don 't Want To Break . Maybe For Alice . No . She Looks Better Hungry . Well , Here They Are . The Downside Of Procreation . It Begins With The O Spoor . What About His Father ? That 's As Far Back As We Go . But You Can Always Ask The Old Man . He 's Still Around . Nicholas Made His Name Taking Over The Brooklyn Docks . Killed A Baker 's Dozen Doing It . Most Of That Traffic Runs Through Jersey Now . The Spoors Have Diversified . Drugs , Prostitution , Counterfeit Goods . Piers Spoor , The Middle Brother , Killed A Few Months Ago In A Gangland Hit . Still Unsolved . Sounds Like A War Is Already On . What Do You Have On Alex ? Whatever Alex Was Into , He Was Flying Too Low For Our Radar . What 's The Connection To Chinatown ? Are The Spoors Making A Move ? Well , Like I Said , They 're Versatile . I Can 't Comment Any Further . You Can 't Comment ? This Isn 't A Press Conference , Is It ? Since Alex Died , There 's Been A Lot Of Chatter On The Wire About The Chens . Any Of That " Chatter " Involve A Name ? The Name Is Chen . I 'll Give You What I Can , Detective . Last Time I Checked , We Were All On The Same Team . That 's My Brother . I 'm Sorry , Mr. Spoor , We Have To Ask You Sooe Questions . What Can You Tell Us About Alex ? Anyone He Had Problems With ? We Know This Is A Difficult Time , But The More Information We Get , The Faster We Get It , The Faster Our Chances Are . Do You Think I Care About Your Chances , Detective ? Like She Said , It 's A Bad Time . We Need Your Help . You Need To Clear A Case , That 's All . This Was My Brother . We 'll Get Whoever Killed Alex . I Don 't Want To Get Him . I Want To Kill Him . I 've Got A Yen For Chinese . You Start A Gang War , Blood Will Run In The Streets . Theirs And Yours . Do You Want To Lose More Family ? I 've Already Lost Two Brothers . And My Family 's Not Your Business . Well , That 's Where You 're Wrong . What Do You Care ? Let 's Just Say I Have A Personal Interest . Now , We 'll Get Whoever Did It . But I Need You To Let Us Do Our Job . One Week . I Don 't Make Deals . It 's Not A Deal . It 's A Promise . You Ever Wonder Why So Many New York Tenements Are Six Stories High ? Water Flowing From The Upstate Reservoirs Will Go That High Unassisted . Otherwise , You Need A Water Tower Or A Separate Pump . You Really Annoy Me Sometimes . Ladies , Nypd Homicide . Do You Recognize This Man ? You 've Never Seen This Guy Before ? No . You Recognize This Man ? Excuse Me . You Ever Seen This Guy Before ? No . Never . Do You Recognize This Man ? No . Talk About Blue Wall . We 've Hit The Great Wall . On The Contrary . Nypd . No Speak . You Speak Fine . All The Tourists Understand You . Maybe We Should Take A Look Inside . You Need Warrant . You Steered Us In . I Was Shocked To Find Illegal Counterfeit Merchandise . Ever Seen This Guy Before ? Huh ? You Know Dooald Chen ? Mr. Chen Good Man . Good Man Is He ? You 've Been Asking About Mr. Chen ? Is That A Crime ? He 's Flying In From Hong Kong ! Tonight . He Will Answer Your Questions At The Midnight Restaurant . 10 : 00 . Charming Man . 10 : 00 . Can I Talk To You ? You 're A Detective . If Someone Doesn 't Return Your Calls , It 's A Clue . What Do I Need To Do To Make This Right ? I Asked What Was Going On With You , And You Handed Me A Fairy Tale About Being 400 Years Old . Ok , I Get It . There Are Things In Your Past You Can 't Talk About . It 's Complicated . I Know About Complicated . I Was Married To A Reporter Who Worked 90 Hours A Week And Called Me Every Day To Tell Me He Loved Me . Turned Out He Was In Chelsea Sleeping With A Former Assistant He Was Putting Through Fashion School . Now She Has Her Own Line . It Isn 't Going To Happen To Me Again . That 's Not What I Meant By Complicated . Look , Something Is Happening Between Us . I Know That , But I Have An Aversion To Being Lied To . So Just Answer Me This : Have You Ever Cheated On Anyone ? What Happened , Happened A Long Time Ago . This Time It 's Different . Is It ? Or Is It Different Every Time You Do It ? Rosie ! Rosie ! I Thought You Were At School . Rosie , This Thing With Alice , It ... It Just Happened . It Doesn 't Mean Anything . It Didn 't " Just Happen " . You Made It Happen . You Can 't Understand . Why Do We Have To Live Like This ? That Girl . She 's ... She 's Five Years Older Than I Am . We 're--This Isn 't A Family . It May Not Be The Family You Want , But It 's The One You 've Got . You 're Right . I Don 't Want It . Rosie . Rosie . Whatever Happens , You 're My Son . You Always Will Be . I Like It . The Darkness . In The Old Days , Before Edison ... You Used Fire . I Know . Mr. Chen . Detectives Marquez And Amsterdam . Nothing For Us . I Understand Dining With You Can Be Hazardous To One 's Health . Mr. Chen , You Probably Know Why We 're Here . Alex Spoor Was Murdered On Your Turf . If There 's A Gang War , It Will Turn This Place Into A Ghost Town . It 'll Kill Your Business Interests . So We Need To Know What You Know . You Remember The Tong Wars ? Turn Of The Century . The Hip Sing Tong , The Four Brothers . Must Have Been The Year Of The Rat . Your Great-Grandfather Was A Police Informant . But The Thing Is , They 're All Gone Now . All Of Them , Forgotten . You Want To Be Remembered , Donny ? Do You Want A Legacy ? Be A Peacemaker . How Did You Know About My Great-Grandfather ? No One Knows That . I 'm A Cop . As For The Spoors , I Don 't Kill Boys . When It 's Time To Cut , I Sever The Head . Get Down ! Everybody , Down ! Eva , You Ok ? Of Course . The Feds . Whoa , Whoa , Whoa , Whoa , Whoa . Sorry . It 's A Family Gathering . Theo Spoor . Mr. Spoor , He 's A Cop . Do We Know Each Other ? We Might Have Known Someone In Common . [ Speaking Dutch ] Let Him In . We Have Nothing To Hide . Five Days Left . Went To Talk To Chen Last Night . Funny Thing . While We Were There , Somebody Shot Up His Restaurant . What 's That Have To Do With Me ? You Tell Me . I Don 't Operate That Way . No ? I 've Seen How You Operate . I 'm A Homicide Detective . My Best Friend Is That Man Right There . You ? I Could Care Less About . Well , My Day Is Ruined . Look , I Can Tell You Where I Was , Who I Was With . But That 's Just Conversation . I Could Have Ordered It Done . But I Didn 't . Now , I 've Done Things You Could Never Understand , But I Never Break My Word . Ever . I Understand Alex Had A Girlfriend . He Liked The Quiet Ones . Just Not Here . Not Today . I Think It 's Extraordinary . Your Best . Do You Love Her ? It 's Just Work . Please , Dutch . Don 't Insult Me . All I Know Is That Ever Since She Arrived , I Can Paint Again . I Did That For You Once . You Still Do . Let 's--Let 's Move Out Of The Village . Lead A Normal Life . It 'll Be Better For Rosie . You Mean For You . Yes . I Don 't Belong Here Anymore . Look At Me , My Hair 's Gone Gray . I Want Different Things . You--You Look And Act The Same As The Moment We Met . I Don 't Want To Lose You . Then You 're Going To Have To Make A Choice , Aren 't You ? We I.D. ' D The Drive-By Shooters At Chen 's . Made A Partial Plate To A Rival Chinese Gang . Ballistics Matched Some Of Their Previous Work . Spoor Was Telling The Truth . Well , Nobody Lies All The Time . Amsterdam . How Was The Wake ? Bet The Beer Was Good . You Went To See Spoor Alone ? I Was In The Neighborhood . You Sure You Weren 't " Taking Care Of Me " ? Partners . It 's Like Marriage Without The Makeup Sex . What Can We Do For You ? Picked Up Something I Thought Would Interest You . Wing Storage Down On Mott ? Alex Kept A Locker Down There . Well , You Can 't Blame The Kid . With What They Pay Teachers These Days . So The Spoors Were Moving In On Chen . Trying To Get In On The Counterfeit Trade . That 's Motive . Maybe . Oh . These Are Good . What Do You Think ? Gina . Thanks For Coming In . When I Talked To You Over The Phone , I Realized It Was Important . It Is . Because You Have The Totally Wrong Idea . Alex Was No Criminal . Think We Got That Idea Opening His Locker Full Of Bootleg Merchandise . I Don 't Care If You Found A Dozen Faberge Eggs . I Know Him . Alex And I Were Together For Three Years . You 're Aware Of His Family . Of Course . Every Christmas , They All Watch The Godfather And Argue About Who Is Which Brother . It 's Pathetic . Alex Hated All That . Hated ? Well , He Loved His Brothers , But He Hated The Life . He Was Trying To Get Away And Build Something That Would Last . But When His Brother Was Killed , Everything Changed . Piers ? Alex Wouldn 't Say Much About It . But It Was Eating Him Up . It 's Such A Waste . Alex Would Have Been A Wonderful Teacher . What Part Of " Confidential Source " Don 't You Understand ? What Do You Care Where The Tip Came From ? It Was Solid . A Little Too Solid . Could Be Somebody Wants To Lay This At Chen 's Door . Somebody Who Wants A War . Like Who ? You 're A Trained Investigator , Amsterdam . Let The Evidence Lead You Where It Leads You . Don 't Outsmart Yourself . You 've Been Investigating The Spoors For Three Years , You Have Nothing On Alex . Then Suddenly , Out Of Nowhere , You Get A Tip On A Locker Filled With Counterfeit Merchandise ? Sometimes You Get Lucky . Woman : Agent Lawson ? Tell Me About Piers Spoor 's Death . Gangland Hit . Probably A Rival Outfit . Alex 's Girlfriend Said That Everything Changed After That . What Did She Mean ? Maybe Alex Was Sensitive . Maybe You 're Protecting Something . Maybe You Should Walk Away . Why ? You Have Someone On The Inside ? Was This Kid Working For You ? Is That Why He Was Killed ? Someone Found Out He Was On The Payroll ? Here 's An Idea : You Do Your Job , We 'll Do Ours . Is That A Yes ? No , Detective . That 's A No . Lawson 's A Fed . If He 's Been Working This Board For Three Years , He 's Heard Everything That 's Been Said In That Brewery . He 's Got Them On A Wire . Electronic Surveillance , 24 / 7 . I Mean , He 's Got To Know More Than He Says . I 'm Just Going To Put Something On That Wire . We 'll See What Happens . Unless You Got A Better Idea . No ? I Didn 't Think So . Are You An Art Lover ? My Great-Great-Grandfather Was A Painter . Walked Out On His Family . Or So The Story Goes . You Never Know With Stories . Over Her . Don 't Drink . You 're Bad For My Business . Tell Me , What Made You Decide To Become A Cop , Anyway ? I Saw Too Many People Get Away With It . Man , You 're Really Bad For My Business . We Found Out Who Shot Up Chen 's Restaurant . You Come Here To Apologize ? We Think We 're About To Break The Case . Really . Found This Witness In Chinatown Who Saw The Killing . One Of Those Ladies Who Steers Tourists In To Buy Knock-Offs . She 's Coming In Tomorrow . She Tell You What She Saw ? It Wasn 't The Chens . She Could Be Working For Them . We Don 't Think So . She Was Pretty Specific . You 'll Keep Me Informed ? You 'll Be The First To Know . I Told You I 'd Find The Killer , Nick . Like You , I Keep My Word . It 's A Family Thing . What Witness ? You Knowow It Is , Lawson . We Have To Protect Our Sources . Did I Come Through Loud And Clear ? We Have Been Working On This Investigation For Three Years . And Yes , We Do Work Holidays , And You Can 't Control This Cowboy ? Seems To Me All He 's Doing Is Investigating A Homicide . We 're Supposed To Be On The Same Team Here . Team ? You 've Got A Wire On Those People And You Haven 't Given Us Spit . We Give You What We Can . What About That Tip On Alex 's Stash ? Was Crap . The Whole Thing Smelled . You Better Watch Your Ass , My Friend . One Step Over The Line , I 'm Gonna Have Your Badge . Maybe You 'd Like To Come Over Here And Take It Off Me . Oh , Boy , A Measuring Contest . We Love When You Do That . Eva , What Have You Got ? I 'm Not Going To Burn A Source . This Case Could Have Serious Implications On Our Investigation . I Want The Name Of This Witness . And I Want The Name Of Alex Spoor 's Killer . Circle Game . Lots Of Fun . Special Agent Lawson , As Of Right Now , We Don 't Have A Name For You . John , Take A Few Days Off . Go Home . What Witness ? No One . I Made It Up . I Am So Glad I Could Take One For You . And You Did That , Why ? I Knew Lawson Had A Wire Inside . I Wanted To See If He 'd React . If He Ignored The Bait , Fine . But If He Didn 't , Then He Has Something Or Someone He 's Protecting . He Bit . You Think He Knows Who Killed Alex ? Alex 's Girlfriend Said That He Hated What His Family Did . What If The Feds Flipped Him ? What If He Was Wired ? You Think The Murder 's On Tape ? There Was No Wire On The Body . We Need Access To Those Tapes . We 'd Have To Get A Court Order . Maybe I 'll Go See Some Family Instead . Amsterdam . You Saw Spoor Without Me Again . Why ? It Was Personal . You Did Know Alex Spoor , Didn 't You ? Yes . And No . Samantha ? Rosie ? The Gods Have Smiled . The Armory Show . They Liked My Work . I Bought Wine . Samantha ? Rosie ? Dna Work . Pronounced Similarity In Genetic Markers ... Alex Spoor Was Family . Not Like You Didn 't Suspect It . To Alex . To Alex . A Descendent Of My Wayward Father . Sorry We Never Knew You . Your Wife And Your Son , Why Didn 't You Go After Them , John ? Try And See Them ? And Say What ? I Knew I 'd Have To Leave Them Sooner Or Later . Better They Left Me . Amsterdam ? Thought You Were Going To Visit Family . I Didn 't Say Whose Family . Hey , Dad . Your Partner Came To Me With A Problem . I Think I Can Help . Whatever Clears The Case . See ? I Told You She 'd Understand . I 'm Not Talking To You . Maybe I Owe My Little Girl One . I 'm Not Your Little Girl , Dad . Not Anymore . I 'm A Cop . I Work My Ass Off Trying To Get A Tiny Bit Of Respect . And Then You Tell My Partner To Take Care Of Me ? Everything I 've Been Trying To Build Goes Down The Drain . It 's A Point . So , How Can You Help ? Thanks For Coming , Terry . When Eddie Marquez Calls , You Listen . He Was My Rabbi . He Saved My Ass More Than Once . You 've Been Running The Wire On The Spoors . From The Get-Go . We 're Working The Alex Spoor Homicide . We Think The Feds Have Been Holding Back . You Want Me To Turn Over Discs From A Confidential Investigation ? You 're Familiar With " Malfeasance , " Terry ? Say A Murder Was Committed And You Had Proof As To Who Was Involved , But You Withhold It . Any Idea What You 'd Be Looking At ? So She 's The Bad Cop ? She 'll Kick Your Ass Out Your Mouth . Look , You Have To Understand , This Whole Thing Was Classified . I Mean , Lawson Said It Was Being Handled At The Highest Levels . Did You Guys Flip Alex ? Not Exactly . The Day He Was Killed , We Picked Up A Phone Conversation . The Two Parties Agreed To A Meet In Chinatown . So We Followed Them And Recorded It Shotgun . We Need To Know What You 've Got . If It Takes A Year In The Courts , We 'll Take That Year , Trust Me . For You , It 'll Be A Very Bad Year . Save It , Guys . You 're Kicking An Open Door . I 'm Still Nypd . I 'll Get You Those Tapes . Nicholas ! I Told You I 'd Keep My Word . What Have You Got ? With Two Days To Spare . Live From Chinatown . Tape : What Are You Doing ? Why Are We Here ? At First , I Thought This Was You , Nicholas , But The Voice Is Too Light . It 's Alex . Tape : I Always Looked Out For You . This One 's You . I Trusted You . And You Go To The Feds . Alex : I Didn 't Go To The Feds . Turn It Off . Now . I Don 't Think So . I Said Turn It Off . Tape : I Know , Alex . You 're Trying To Sell Me Out . You Killed Piers , Nicholas . Don 't Talk To Me About Selling Out . Piers Betrayed Us . To The Chens . So You Murdered Him ? Yes , I Talked To The Feds , And I 'd Talk To Them Again . You Got To Be Stopped , Nick . Piers Was Our Brother . Not Anymore . And Neither Are You . No ! No ! No , Please ! I Got It Wrong , Nick . It Wasn 't Alex Who Was On The Feds ' Payroll , It Was You . For Years , You 've Been Giving Them Stuff . Wearing A Wire . That 's How You Found Out Alex Had Talked To Them . They Were Feeding You . You Can 't Touch Me . We 're Not The Feds . I Think We Can . Kill Them . Do It . You Don 't Have A Family Anymore , Nick . Nicholas Spoor Was The Most Important Source We Have Had In This Division 's In The Last 20 Years . Do You Know How Many Convictions He Brought Us ? He Also Killed His Brothers . What Do You Think We Deal With Out There ? They 're All Killers . Alex Spoor Wasn 't . Now , Answer Me This ... How Did Nicholas Know Alex Had Approached The Feds ? How ? It 's All About Protecting The Golden Goose . You Are Way Out Of Line Here . Special Agent Derek Lawson . What A Happy Coincidence . I 've Just Gotten Off The Phone With Your Sac . Apparently , You Failed To Disclose Some Vital Information About Your Investigation . Why Are You Talking To My Superiors ?

They 've Turned It Over To Opr , Who Are Starting Their Own Investigation . Of You . Amsterdam . You Concern Me . Can This Wait ? You 're A Lone Ranger . That Never Ends Well . Look At Lawson . That Is Truly Annoying . Tell Me About It . Mr. Spoor . / . I Never Got A Chance Uo Tell You How Sorry I Was About Alex . Dying So Young . He Got Robbed . I Wanted To Ask You About Your Father . Rosie ? He Was A Good Man . A Teacher . Like Alex . Family Split Up When Rosie Was 17 . Kid Changed His Name . Never Saw His Dad Again . Rosie Became A Teacher ? But Then How Did The Family Get Into- - The Depression , I Made Some Choices . Made A Lot Of Money With Those Choices . My Children And My Children 's Children Paid The Price . You Got Kids ?

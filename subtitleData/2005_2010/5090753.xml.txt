 NARRATOR : Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles : SARAH : There 's a warehouse in the desert . They 're building something there . Metal . - Who are you ? - My name 's Winston . Where 's the metal ? DEREK : I talked to your mom . She found something . - Is it real this time ? - I detected this audio transmission ... - ... on an unsecured line . MAN : Breach . Man shot at Heat and Air . Shut the place down . You mind telling me where you keep your demolition materials ? I hate funerals . Mom , everybody who knew anything about the factory is dead . - Well , I 'm not . DIANA : Winston . Did you know my husband , Sarah ? The whole place was wired . Every house . Every move anyone ever made was being watched . You 're tired . You 've been sick . Chasing killer robots will do that . SARAH : Midnight is the witching hour . If you believe that kind of thing , and most people won 't admit it if they do midnight is the time when a door opens from our world into the next and we are visited by dark spirits of the shadow lands . The incubus , the succubus , the old hag . Visitors are known by many names but each story bears the same marks . The demons come after midnight in the first three hours of the new day when we are alone and vulnerable , deep asleep and helpless . When we cannot move . They lay on us , press on us , suffocate us , take from us what is most precious . Our lives , our love , our sanity . Our sleep . If you believe in that kind of thing . John . [ PHONE BEEPS ] Where are you ? SARAH : In an industrial park near downtown . Mom , it 's almost 12 . I was hoping you were asleep . Well , it didn 't take . JOHN : What are you doing ? I got a lead off the surveillance tapes of Charm Acres . Yeah , how many hours of people sleeping did you watch ? All of them . JOHN : So where are you ? SARAH : Western Iron and Metal . They supplied metal tooling equipment to Desert Heat and Air . You think they 're connected to Skynet . Get on the computer , find out who owns the place . I 'm on it . [ CLATTERING ] [ ELECTRICAL BUZZING ] [ GASPING ] HOBSON : Sarah . Sarah . Sarah . You had another nightmare . I can 't stay here anymore . - You 've only been here one night . - Feels a lot longer . We don 't have enough data to prescribe a treatment . - The first night establishes a baseline . - I 'll be fine . You go home now , things will only get worse . You think two weeks without sleep is bad ? Try two or three years . It happens . Everyone needs their sleep . Not everyone . You do . I 'm going to get you coffee . But I have to warn you . This is a decaf only facility , all right ? Hmm . [ LIGHTER CLICKING ] [ IN BRITISH ACCENT ] Can I help you ? Who are you ? I 'm your roommate . Dana . When did you get here ? I checked in last night while you were asleep . Well , not really asleep . More like thrashing and screaming in your bed . What 's with the lighter ? - What lighter ? - The one in your bra . I 'm trying to give up smoking . - In a sleep clinic . - Yeah , I 've got sleep problems too . The doctors think it 's related to my chronic fatigue . Which was caused by my eating disorder . Which is why I had the lap band surgery . You know , the staple in your stomach . But are the doctors satisfied with that ? No . They want to take away all my vices . Well , that 's not gonna happen . - A girl 's gotta sin sometime . - Hence the smoking . Yeah , that and the younger men . [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] - Mom . - Hey , Tiger . Hello . Uh ... . Ahem . It 's visiting time . Cameron 's in the cafeteria . DANA [ WHISPERING ] : Hey . Do me a favor . Let 's keep this our little secret . Scrambled or hard boiled ? Scrambled . You need a carbohydrate that makes up 15 percent of your daily allowance . Those won 't be as good as yours . You made pancakes ? I added a teaspoon of vanilla to your recipe . - I don 't have a recipe . - The recipe on the box . Not as good as hers ? Not as good as food . Tomorrow , I 'll bring you something real to eat . - They have anything to say ? - About what ? About what ? About why you 're not sleeping . They figured out why ? Besides the fact the world 's about to end ? You used to sleep well . I shouldn 't be here . I should be at home . We 're fine at home . Everything 's fine . [ SCOFFS ] This was a mistake . No , this- - This is necessary . Mom you 're useless like this . Look at yourself . You haven 't slept in two weeks . You fell down the stairs . If you don 't take care of yourself , something worse might happen . You need to get better . I need you to get better . Don 't forget . You 're not her . Please , get some sleep . [ GASPS ] [ ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER STEREO ] [ ENGINE AND MUSIC STOP ] [ DOOR SLAMS ] [ DOOR OPENS ] You 're dead . - I killed you . - And I killed you . One of us is gonna have to step it up . [ GRUNTS ] So . You want to know who I am ? It 's the first thing most people ask . First thing out of their mouths when the gag comes off . " Who are you ? " And they keep asking it over and over again . Psychiatrists say naming things gives people power over them . They 're dead wrong on that . I already know who you are . Oh , yeah . Right . I forgot . And you found Western Iron and Metal . [ WHIMPERS ] Course , I wouldn 't expect anything less from the girl that used a cross-dresser and a hypno-therapist to find us . You know , I gotta admit , I didn 't see that one coming . You won 't see the next one coming , either . No , no . I beg to differ , ma 'am . I beg to differ . So who do you work for ? I work alone . Somebody blew up our factory while you were getting patched up . Was that your boyfriend on the phone ? What are you guys , some kind of a Bonnie-and-Clyde-type operation ? I said , was that your Clyde on the phone ? Why don 't you come closer and I 'll tell you ? So you can bite my face off ? No . I don 't think so . See those seeds ? I go through about a bag in three hours . Little habit I picked up when I quit smoking . Before I finish that bag , you 're gonna talk . Special recipe . Uhn . It 'll have you singing like Sunday choir . What 's wrong ? Gel too cold ? Most people don 't like the electrodes first time . Makes them feel like Frankenstein . You 'll get used to it . - I 'm willing to bet you sleep better tonight . - What 's happening to me ? Let me show you something . These are our observation machines . And this is your chart . There are five stages to the sleep cycle . The fifth stage is the most active . Increased respiration rate ... - ... blood pressure , brain activity . - REM sleep . When most dreaming occurs . It 's rare , but sometimes night terrors like the ones you 're experiencing can- - I never said I was experiencing night terrors . You didn 't have to . Your chart tells us everything we need to know . Night terrors can be caused by a brain tumor . Cancer . Which , far as we can tell , you don 't have . MRI showed your brain was clear . No heart disease , nocturnal asthma , or sleep apnea . What 's wrong with you is in your head . And by your head , I mean your mind . Therapy to reduce anxiety is part of the usual treatment . Have you ever seen a therapist ? A lot of people find talking one on one to be helpful ... - ... in breaking down what 's going on . - I tried it . Didn 't take . How about a prescription ? Diazepam usually helps . Don 't like drugs . Speaking of drugs , has your roommate been smoking again ? I 'm not interested in being anybody 's mother . I 've got two kids of my own and that 's enough . Did you know about this ? Besides all the other obvious hazards , nicotine is a stimulant . Hits the brain in seconds , adds 20 heartbeats per minute . I quit smoking years ago . I 've got too much excitement in my life . [ CHUCKLES ] Yeah , don 't we all ? Well , I have to file a report on this . I 'll be back later to attach your electrodes . It 's a dreamcatcher . It 's supposed to catch nightmares . Hector made me one too . - Hector ? - The cleaning guy . You know , papi chulo with the neck tattoo . You look tired . You should take that as a compliment . I ran into Nurse Ratched in the hallway . She smacked my bum for the cigarette and gave me some sleeping pills . The good stuff . So , what about you ? Drowning ? Being chased ? Teeth falling out ? Being chased should probably cover it . You 're running away from something you don 't want to deal with . Least that 's what they say , anyway . And you ? Oh , I burn alive . Yeah , my whole body just catches on fire . I try and I try and I can 't put myself out . - Anxiety about quitting smoking . - That , or I was a witch in another life . They say if you die in your dreams , you die in real life . Oh , I 've died a thousand times . Never gets any easier . For all nightmares it 's caught I 'm surprised it hasn 't spilled them out all over the bed . Do the bad guys ever catch you ? [ ELECTRICAL BUZZING ] [ INHALES DEEPLY ] That 's quite a collection . Bullet wounds . Stabbings . Emergency C-section . But that 's plenty old , that last one . Your child must be 15 , maybe 20 by now . They 'll kill you . Just like they killed everyone else . - They ? - Your bosses . Kaliba . They blew up your factory . Killed 30 of their own people . Lady , you 're insane . Why would anyone blow up their own factory ? To hide what you were building . And what was that ? The End . You 're very dramatic . Diana thought you were a good man . What do you think she 'd say if she saw you now ? You- - You leave my wife out of this you crazy bitch . [ GRUNTING , GROANING ] Dana . Dana , wake up . Dana , wake up . [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ] [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ] [ KEYPAD CHIRPING ] [ CURTAIN OPENING ] Your electrodes came off last night . Did you take them off ? I don 't remember . Are you a sleepwalker ? It 's happened once or twice . You didn 't mention that in your intake . It must have slipped my mind . I 'm sorry . So you don 't remember getting out of bed last night ? I don 't remember anything . Salvador Dali often explored the subconscious and the dream world in his work . Are your dreams like this painting ? Everyone 's dreams are different . Guess it depends on what 's stuck in your head . Gaah- - Come on . What 's it like to dream ? Oh ... . Um ... . It 's sort of like you 're in a play or a movie and it looks real and it feels real . How do you know it 's not real ? Sometimes you don 't . [ POUNDING ON GLASS ] [ JOHN GRUNTS ] [ SIGHS ] Hey . Hey . Be careful . [ COINS CLINKING ] Yes , thank you . John . What 's wrong ? Something strange is going on here . Like what ? I woke up last night and saw the nurse giving my roommate a shot . Okay , well , it 's a medical clinic . So , what 's strange about that ? She was passed out . She 'd already taken sleeping pills . So you think the nurse is , what , like the angel of death ? After she gave her the shot , she went to a room in the basement . [ INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ] Well , she looks all right . No , she 's not . No one is . Mom . Did you sleep last night ? You think I 'm making this up ? No . I don 't think you 're making this up . It 's just- - You 're a mess . Don 't be fooled , John . Don 't be fooled by anyone 's face . You don 't know what 's behind anyone 's face . You 're talking about the guy at the factory . The one who shot you . The one you shot . We don 't talk about that . - We can talk about anything . - No , we can 't . Is he the one in your nightmares ? It 's always the same . He comes out of nowhere . He grabs me . Takes me hostage in a van . What does he want ? To know who I am . Who I 'm working with . He has me tied up . Drugged . He isn 't real . He can 't hurt you anymore . He 's in my head , and I can 't get him out . Look at me . You did what you had to do . You defended yourself . I 'm not supposed to defend myself . I 'm supposed to defend you . HOBSON : Nap time . Don 't worry . We 'll get her to close her eyes . Come on . [ GASPS , GROANS ] My wife . What was she wearing ? At my funeral . Black . Hair down or back ? Down . And earrings . Pearls . I bought those for her birthday . Salary must be good . It 's the best part of the job . And the worst ? You saw the tapes . - Yeah . - So you know . Yes . The first one was the hardest . Frank ? Your neighbor . His son played lacrosse . He borrowed my lawn mower every Friday . [ SIGHS ] He never cleaned the bag . Why would they want him dead ? He kept the books . Handled the overseas business . He was a drunk . Overseas ? So your bosses are foreign . They fixed me up after you shot me . Put me in a private clinic . And I thought it was because they were being kind . Then I realized . They 're just patching me up so I can do my job . What 's your job ? Like I said the first one was the hardest . You were my first . Seem surprised . Well , I just figured , a bad-ass gal like yourself- - Never . Well , I 'm glad I didn 't break your streak . I can help you disappear . You and your wife . Hmm . They 'll hunt us down . They 'll slaughter us . There are ways to keep them off your trail . Things I 've learned . - Like what ? - You ditch the van . Get a new car . Check into an expensive hotel . The most expensive you can find . They 'll always expect the opposite . You have my phone . When I get back to my people , I 'll call you . But we have to move fast so they don 't know what 's happening . Her smell . It 's what I miss the most . Like clean laundry . Aah ! Oh ! You didn 't see that one coming ? Hmm ? [ ALARM BLARING ] [ ALARM BLARING , FIRE CRACKLING ] Dana . HOBSON : Get out of the room . - Dana . Get out of the room . - She 's in there . She 's in there . - Get her out of the way . - Is she in there ? She 's in there . MAN : Come on . Hello ? Remember I told you something strange was going on ? Uh , the- - The nurse . My roommate 's dead . She died last night in a fire . They 're trying to claim it 's some accident . Maybe you should come home . No . Not now . [ WOMAN COUGHS , CLEARS THROAT ] First of all , I 'd like to give you an update on Dana 's condition . There 's a rumor going around that she didn 't pull through . That 's not the case . Dana is in extremely critical condition , but she is still alive . This has been a traumatic experience for all of us . Patients , if you choose to leave the clinic , you may return any time to complete your treatment . However , it would be of great value to us and to you , if we were to evaluate your sleep patterns during this duress . Whatever you choose , we fully support your decision . [ CROWD MURMURING ] HOBSON : Ms. Baum . I hear you 've decided to stay . I have . An incident like this increases cortisol . You may find it more difficult to sleep . Here . These should help . Diazepam . Like I said , standard treatment for insomnia . You should take them now . Good . I 've been meaning to say thank you . For the dreamcatcher . You make them for all the patients ? Just the ones who need them . The ones who have nightmares . Did you know her well ? She ain 't dead . Right . Sorry . She kept saying she dreamt she died in a fire . Maybe I should have made her a bigger one . Nightmare didn 't burn her . A cigarette did . She should 've taken charge . Taken charge ? Of what was going on inside her head . Controlled it . - You believe it , then ? - Of course I do . Coyote . Does it have mystical significance ? Does it protect you ? Guide you ? This ? No . This was for my girl . She thinks it 's sexy . - Tell me a story . - Go to hell . Ha . What most people know about torture is bullcrap . It 's not the pain that gets people to talk . It 's the talking that causes people pain . So tell me a story . You told me a story once , in the warehouse . Story about your son . That 's when you let me go . Ha . Looking back on it , it 's funny . You don 't strike me as the sentimental type . Your story , not mine . Yeah , but you believed it . You believed it because you have a child . I 've seen your scar . My story is your story . That 's why you told it back to me when I asked you . This is what is important . This is who you 're protecting . You have a son . He 's your accomplice . See ? That wasn 't so hard . So your son is your accomplice . You 're not Bonnie . You 're Ma Barker . - He 's just a boy . - A boy you 'd die to protect . Any mother would . You 'd be surprised . The enemy 's like a weed . You leave any part of it underground , it 'll pop back up when you least expect it . You gotta kill the root . [ CHUCKLES ] Or in this case the seed . You won 't get anywhere near him . He 's not alone . I won 't have to . You 're his mother . He 'll come to you . He won 't come anywhere near here . He knows better . He will . He will when you ask him . [ GASPS ] We don 't need to talk anymore . I won 't call him . I 'll die first . Oh , you 'd like that . To die . But it 's never that easy , is it ? Hey . Hey , wake up . You okay ? You called me . Yes . The nurse . She gave me a shot . Some kind of sedative . Let 's get out of here . No . She 's going to keep hurting people . We have to do something . [ KEYPAD CHIRPING ] [ LOCK CLICKS ] Think you can hack the combination ? In my sleep . [ KEYPAD CHIRPING ] [ LOCK CLICKS ] It 's some kind of scanning program . It 's neural activity . Brain scans . [ TYPING ] - There 's files . Thousands of them . - Am I in there ? I don 't know . It 's by patient number . All right . There 's a ton of data on you . It 's a whole profile . Delete it . All of it . It 's a Skynet experiment , John . They 're stealing everything . - No , Mom- - - Sleep is the perfect cover . Your brain 's active but you don 't remember . - They run a sleep clinic . - They 're not people . Get rid of it . Nurse Hobson ? There 's a problem in room 22 . No data . Ms. Baum 's electrodes must have slipped off again . Thank you for explaining . Is that everything ? - Almost . - I don 't want a trace of me left- - - I know . - All of it . All of it . Get rid of it . I don 't want any of me in there . All right , it 's gone . It 's all gone , okay ? You 're all gone . Whatever she gave me , it 's starting to hit . [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] [ KEYPAD CHIRPING ] [ LOCK CLICKS ] This is a restricted area . How did you get in here ? I don 't know . I must 've been sleepwalking . Through a locked door ? Sorry . I 'll go back to my room . Did you know that when a human falls in love the same areas of the brain light up as when a human is intoxicated ? What does that have to do with my nightmares ? We don 't know yet . We don 't fully understand why humans need to dream . Humans like you ? You drugged me . What you 're experiencing is sleep paralysis . You want to move but you can 't . [ GASPS ] Believe it or not , your body is actually protecting you right now . You were talking to someone when I entered the room . Your boy . The one who came to visit . Call to him . [ GASPS ] I 'd die first . HOBSON : I 'm sure you 'd like that . To die . But it 's never that easy . What is this thing ? Mom . What are you ? SARAH : John . John . [ GUN CLICKING ] [ SARAH WHIMPERS ] [ MUFFLED SOBBING ] WINSTON : It 's her son . He 's the one who helped her blow up the facility . He 's the one we want . We 'll give him a few more hours to show up . I don 't know . Maybe three . She gave me a few problems . Nothing I couldn 't handle . Yeah . I guess we don 't need her anymore . No . He can trace her cell phone without her alive . Makes no difference to me . It 's not a problem . I 'll take care of it right now . [ EXHALES ] Hell , it 's what she wants . - Aah ! - Uhn ! [ GRUNTING ] [ GROANING ] You 're real . You 're real . You 're real . [ GUNSHOT ] SARAH : A spirit sits on a man 's chest . She is strong , beautiful . She is here to steal his children . She is here to steal his future . He is paralyzed . The terror in him will burst his heart if he cannot control it . She is a Night-Mare , a demon-woman the oldest and most enduring story told by man . The witching hour is controlled by witches . She is a bad dream . She is a bad bitch . [ ENGLISH SDH ]

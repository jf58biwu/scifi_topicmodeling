 The Dark Prince returns . Yes . Tickets to the horror show . Fetch the paper , Eedo . - Hey , man , run ! - What ? Hey ! Hi there , Frank ! Saw you working up there . Putting in a security light , eh ? The days are getting shorter . It 'll be nice for Catherine if she works late . - Your wife got the job ? - Yeah . Ah , terrific ! What is the name of what she does again ? - She 's a clinical social worker . - Right . - You got all the tools you need ? - l think I 'm all squared away , Jack . - Frank ? - Yeah ? Got a phone call . - Hi . - Hi . Come on , Benny ! Let 's go outside ! - Hello ? - Peter Watts . Yes , Peter . I 'm down in San Francisco. I got what could be a multiple homicide here . - Do you want to send the details ? - The lack of detail has created concern . We could use you here . Right. I 'll make the arrangements . Was that someone from the Group ? - Something to look at in San Francisco . - Soon ? Right after I finish wiring up that light . Well , we 're set . - Peter . - Frank . - How was the trip ? - Good . What 've you got ? Members of the gardening club noticed that ashes were being deposited in the park rose beds over the past few weeks . One of them notified the detectives this morning when she found this . It appears to be adult . A good portion of the interior helix is still intact . I think we can get a nice impression of the remaining auricle . There 's a lot of ashes that have been dumped here , Frank . It might be illegal crematory dumping ... - No , he ... - He 's what , Frank ? The killer knows the victim . He wants to watch him suffer . I think there are multiple bodies here . What 's he using , a crematory oven ? It 's important to him that he burns them alive . - Why ? - l don 't know . OK , what 's going on in here ? Benny 's giving me kisses ! Well , there 's way too much fun going on in here . OK . Ben , bedtime . Downstairs , bedtime . Thank you , thank you . And you ... Mommy , when is Daddy coming home ? I don 't know , honey . Soon . Maybe tomorrow . - ls he working ? - Yes . Catching the bad man ? If there 's a bad man , I 'm sure Daddy 's going to catch him . Now , I want you to close those eyes and count as high as you can , OK ? OK . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fourteen , fifteen , sixteen , seventeen , eighteen , nineteen , twenty-one , twenty-two , twenty-three , twenty-four , twenty-five , twenty-six , twenty-seven , twenty-eight ... - Hello . - Hi , it 's me . - What ? What 's wrong ? - Nothing. I ... I got a little spooked by the security light . - What happened ? Are you all right ? - l 'm fine. ltjust went on and ... - l 'm sure it was just a cat . - lt 's nothing , honey . Just an adjustment . You guys all locked up ? We 're fine , Frank , really . It 's a perfectly safe neighborhood . Frank ! - l gotta go . Want me to call you back ? - No . - Did you catch the bad man , Frank ? - No . But we will . - l know . - l love you . This is Jim Penseyres . He worked at VlCAP after you left . - l don 't know if you met . - No . Hi . What 'd you find ? Excavation is incomplete , pending a problem with the parks department . But we were able to separate out most of what there was in the plant beds . 39 pounds of carbonized human remains , roughly the equivalent of seven adults . Dating is difficult , but a defined stratum would indicate more than one deposit . - What else ? - The remains are clean , uniform . No large fragments , apart from the ear , which would indicate extreme heat . - What kind of heat ? - Bone carbonizes at 1400 degrees . But I 'd put this at 2100 , 2200 . - What about the ear ? - l don 't know how it survived . But we pulled a mold and ... something lucky . The tissue contained traces of lysergic acid , LSD . Also phosgene , a relatively uncommon gas found at accident sites , chemical plants using carbon tetrachloride . - Dry-cleaning fluid . - Yeah . There was an accident at a dry-cleaning facility here seven years ago . They 've got a block of abandoned buildings near Pier 23 . Not much left of anything . No . Do we know who owns these buildings ? The city . They 've been for sale for years . No buyers . I don 't know , Frank . What do you think they 'd be doing in here ? Maybe this is where the victims were subdued . Peter . On the number 16 molar , there 's a crown that 's been done recently . Any indication how it was removed ? From the scoring on the enamel , it looks like some kind of crude metal tool . There 's a cuspid filling that 's state of the art . These other fillings are substandard compound amalgam . - Which indicates something important . - They were done somewhere else . Two root canals were done with a process known as N-2 . They look different in x-rays . You find this work coming out of Eastern Europe , Russia . The poor condition of the teeth suggests the latter . - Who 's running this through the records ? - Penseyres is working with the PD . Got a surprise for you guys . Look who came down from the mountain ! What are you doing here , Mike ? Caught the same fish three days in a row . Big brown , five pounds if he 's an ounce . Figured the fish and I both needed a day off . - Hey , Mike . - Frank . Thanks for coming on short notice . - Some case . - Yeah . - We need a break on these dental records . - Do you have a second , Frank ? I never told anyone about these . But I want you to know I was very upset when I opened the package . - l can only imagine how you must have felt . - Right . I appreciate you confiding in me . You 're the reason I was able to come back to work , that I 'm a member of the Group . Does Catherine have any idea these new photos were taken ? I never keep anything from her , but we 've barely settled in . - You 're right not to . - ls that your threat assessment ? There 's a low-risk potential in the photographer escalating from stalking . Three years since his first mailing , he 's still keeping a safe distance . - He doesn 't want to be discovered . - He has followed us . I 'd be more concerned if I thought this was about Catherine . - What do you mean ? - He sends the photos to you . The envelope has your name on it . What 's the object of terrorism ? - Terror . - That 's all he wants at this point . Then he 's a success . You got anything else , Mike ? The film was purchased in Washington state . He 's taken care not to contaminate the film or the package . Did you come all the way here just to allay my fears ? It would be the easiest thing in the world to go home , Frank . But we need you here . We need your abilities . I have a bad feeling about this case . It is not like any other case I 've ever seen . That would be my threat assessment . Hi . My name 's Bob Smith , and I hope you have a moment , because I have a one-time offer on a new hair care product . Would you like to try our product , absolutely free ? Well , terrific . I just need your name and address . And a credit card number for future purchases . - No orders written ? - Not yet . Hello ? is anybody there ? Hi . My name is Bob Smith . I hope you have a moment . The dental records matched a missing-person report from six months ago , filed by the kid 's parents . Mother and father were naturalized . lmmigrated from Chechnya in 1990 when the son was 15 . The kid had a nice rap sheet : BE , minor assault , possession . Parents ' address is 13235 Liberty Avenue . - Mr Bolow ? - Yes ? Frank Black , Peter Watts . Very sorry about your son . We 're trying to find out how this happened . Six months you couldn 't find Eedo , and now you want me to help you ? We 're not from the police , Mr Bolow . Your son might be one of several victims . He wouldn 't listen to us . Eedo had his own ideas , put in his head by these friends of his . - What friends , Mr Bolow ? - Driving those German cars . All he could talk about . Then one day Eedo comes home driving one too . Selling products nobody wants over the phone . - Do you know where he worked ? - He said he couldn 't tell us . He said he was going to be rich . - Had you heard from him recently ? - Six months ago , he sent us a letter . A terrible letter . That 's when we called the police . My wife was so ashamed , she wanted to burn it . It 's in Russian . You want me to translate ? We wouldn 't want to put you through that . Thank you for letting us read it . It would be a big help if we could have a look at the envelope too . Thank you . The salutation is to his mother . He 's disowning her . " l am cutting the ties that prevent my ascendance to a higher stage . " " My birthrights and all my former worldly possessions have been ... burned in a sacrificial fire ... of my new faith . " Cult indoctrination . There 's a reference to fidelity and duty , and burning in the fires of Gehenna . " lf l should dishonor myself or my brothers . " " Gehenna " is Hebrew for hell . " l have seen the all-powerful one in the pouring red rain , and I fear nothing but his wrath and vengeance . The end is coming . " " The numbers have been miscalculated . 24 times 15 are 360 , adjustable by ... 286.1 . There is a deliberate error in the Great Pyramid of Giza , that some prophets have cited as an error in our calculation of the calendar year . Some believe it sets the apocalypse in 1998 . Plan your investment strategy accordingly ! He says the weak and the indolent shall perish . He is with his new family and must renounce his parents , just as he renounces his belief in anything but the power of the enterprise . The power of the enterprise resides in the hearts of the faithful . - And in the ashes of the dead . - Somebody got into this kid 's head . - l 'm not sure he 's writing out of faith . - He 's writing out of fear . - Could have been forced . - Too many intransitive verbs . The imagery - very powerful , very personal . The use of " Gehenna " is strange - archaic and found only in Old Testament translations . - Maybe he went to Hebrew school . - Somebody powerful got a hold on this kid . Or some thing . Wake up , sweetie . We 're home . You waiting for me ? You want to go outside ? Catherine ? - Catherine , it 's Bob Bletcher . - Bob ? Yeah . - ls everything OK ? - Yeah . - Actually , you scared me half to death . - Oh , I 'm sorry. I was ... Frank asked if I could stop by . He was a little worried about you and Jordan . Oh , I 'm sorry . Thank you . We 're fine . Really . - You 're sure ? - Yeah. I just wasn 't expecting anyone . - Would you like to come in ? - No , you got your girl to put to bed . I 'm going to put some coffee on , OK ? So , how much has he told you ? About his breakdown ? Only a little bit more than I 'd already heard . He told me about the Polaroids that someone took of you , and that after he found them , he couldn 't leave the house . - That he was afraid to leave you alone . - He was paralyzed , Bob . Not by fear . By something much deeper . By understanding . Yeah , he talked about that . About being able to see into the darkness . That he 'd developed a kind of ... facility ... to see what a killer sees . As well as you know him , as long as you two worked together , I don 't think anyone can appreciate what that must be like . No . But I 'm sure you know better than anyone . I don 't know how he was able to do it , how he ever went back to work . He was approached by this Millennium Group . Yes , but Frank went back to work because he had to. lt 's who he is . Sometimes I think of Frank as the Catcher in the Rye , standing at the edge of the cliff , trying to save the world . But he can 't change anything . All he can do is catch these horrible men before they kill again . That 's why I can never let him think that Jordan and I aren 't perfectly safe in this perfect house and perfect world that he 's tried to give us . Because I know , if he ever thought differently , next time he 'd never be able to leave . It 's all right . I 'm not gonna hurt you. lt 's OK . How long have you been in San Francisco ? I don 't know anything . Come on , what were you doing out there tonight ? My name is Bob Smith . - Anything ? - Not yet . Only given his name as Bob Smith . He 's saying they 're talking to a dead man . What were you doing out there , Frank ? Went back to satisfy a curiosity about what happened out there that night . And ? I think I know what he 's afraid of . Then maybe you should talk to him . You 've seen it , haven 't you ? Seen the hideous face . Just like Eedo did . Seen the red rain falling and the face of the beast . I 've seen it too . I know why you 're afraid . But you 're safe from it now . No one is safe from it . You don 't know what you 're talking about . How can it touch you here ? What could it do to you here ? You don 't understand . It knows . It knows everything. lt knows the numbers . - What numbers ? - That 's all there is . Phone numbers , serial numbers , card numbers ... You and everybody else . The numbers are all we are . It knows your numbers and it knows you . - What does it want ? - Obedience . Obedience and control . In return for what ? To share in the power when the end comes . When the everlasting fires rage in the year of destiny . When the weak and the indolent perish . They told me ... we were going to be rich ! That we were the chosen ones ! That discipline was the way to salvation . That prosperity was power . And they said we could leave whenever we wanted. lt was a lie . No one could leave , and it made us turn on each other . Did it kill Eedo Bolow ? Yes . Because he was weak . Because he 'd lost his discipline . Just like the others did . Just like I did . Once you 've lost your faith and discipline , it will devour you . Nothing can save you from it . You can 't save me from it . Hey ! God ... Get a doctor ! Go home , Frank . I think you should go home , see your family and rest . That kid died of fright , Mike . He was so full of LSD , we 'll never know what he died of . He couldn 't escape it , whatever it was . What could be so powerful that you couldn 't escape it ? What you described in there last night , the face of the beast ... I saw it , the day I arrived . I 've seen the face of evil , Frank . I 've looked into its eyes , seen it staring back at me . But the face has always been a man 's face , a human 's face . I 've always believed that evil is born in a cold heart and a weak mind . I have , too . Hi there , Frank . See you were gone for a few days . Work ? Hi , Jack . Yeah . - That consultant group you mentioned ? - Yeah . Yeah ... Consulting - you always wonder exactly what that means , you know ? We 're given a problem , we try to solve it . Oh , I see . Yeah . So , did you solve the problem you were working on ? No . No , I didn 't . Couldn 't even make sense of it . - Want to say goodnight to Jordan ? - Yeah . I hear it 's a real potboiler . Full of treachery , death , violence ... Yeah . Looking for moral guidance , or a little light bedtime reading ? Just some answers , I guess . Something happened down in San Francisco . Anything you want to talk about ? I 'm confused about something I thought I understood about evil . - What it is , exactly . - You mean what causes it ? It seems the biblical concept of the devil 's influence has lost any currency . I just think the language has changed . Science and psychology have given us a clearer idea of why people commit evil acts . I see it every day . Abused kids become abusive adults . - So the true source of evil is us ? - You mean are we all capable of it ? Or is there something out there , a force , waiting until it can create another murder , another rape , another Holocaust ? I think it 's something that everyone who looks deeply at life wonders . What would you tell a child ? What would I tell Jordan ? Maybe you should just tell her good night . - Hello ? - Frank ? It 's Mike Atkins . - Sorry for calling so late . - l 'm up working anyway . So am I . - Where are you ? - Still in San Francisco . We got our forensic data on the dead boy . Found something we weren 't expecting . Traces of an insecticide used in the making of something called sarin . Sarin gas . Used in the terrorist attack on the subway in Japan . The leader of the cult responsible is on trial for that as well as several other murders . Do you know how they say he disposed of his victims ? An industrial-scale microwave . He 'd amassed a billion dollars . Been trying to buy weapons from the Russians . He may have even been trying to get the Ebola virus . - He wanted to bring on Armageddon . - Could it happen here , Frank ? Frank ? Mike , I found a business listing for Gehenna International . An offshore holding company . - What does it hold ? - Industrial products , chemicals . They list one of their plants in San Francisco . I 'm on it . - What ? - l don 't know . I just have a very bad feeling about something . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Let me out ! Hey ! Turn it off ! Turn it off ! - Check his pulse . - Get an ambulance ! Go ! Law enforcement agencies worked in tense cooperation in the roundup of what is being referred to as a death cult , whose aim is believed to be mass destruction . The suspected leader is a former chemical engineer , Ricardo Clement . He is being held under the suspicion of murder of at least one cult member . Authorities confiscated a large cache of biological and other weapons . How many boys died in there ? How many kids did you send to their death ? Ten ? Twenty ? What the hell are you ? Nothing . Absolutely nothing . - l think I know . - What ? Who he is . I gotta get out of here , Peter . Frank , your wife 's here . - You didn 't have to come . - l wanted to be here . I wanted to be here with you , Frank . I know it 's what you fear . What ? Losing control . Having something like this happen to someone you care about . He had serious internal cellular damage from the radiation , but the doctors say he 'll pull through . I know , and he will . I know you know this . How many other lives you may have saved ? How many people could have been hurt by those weapons ? - l know . - You did what was important . You did what you set out to do , Frank . You caught the bad man . I 'm not so sure . Not sure of what ? Not sure ... Not sure if the bad man can be caught . Visiontext Subtitles : Paul Webster US english

 PETER : Previously on Heroes . I think Sylar 's beginning to emerge again . I 'm part of you , Matt . Whatever you did to me , I held on . Now I 'm inside your head . I 'm in control here , not the power . And not you , you son of a bitch . Keppler . The guy 's name is Keppler . Lives in Long Beach . ANGELA ON PHONE : You 're supposed to be the man with the plan , remember ? I 'm not sure I 'm that guy anymore . Why is that ? Because I 've lost my family , Angela . You know , maybe changing your name back to Bennet wasn 't such a great idea after all , but they say college is for reinventing yourself . Have you ever heard of the Jump-Push-Fall test ? All we need is a dummy the approximate size and weight of Annie . So , where do we get our hands on a dead body ? ( GASPS ) CLAIRE : I guess she did kill herself I met an empath . You talk to him ? Didn 't really get a chance . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) GRETCHEN : Claire . Claire . It 's Gretchen , open up . ( CONTINUES KNOCKING ) Claire , we need to talk . ( SIGHS ) No , darling . This batch isn 't for you . I think ... I think I found someone to fill Joseph 's shoes . I 'm going out . Wearing that ? I 'd draw unwanted attention being myself . Haven 't worn a suit since I was a boy . Our parents forced us to be prim . Binding us to a life of combed hair and shined shoes . And then I discovered I could control the very earth under my feet . And I was liberated . I could be filthy . ( SAMUEL CHUCKLES ) ( SIGHS ) Tie still feels like a damn noose around my neck . Come here . You don 't have to leave . You know I can do whatever you want . No . Thank you . It 's my responsibility . Ever since Joseph died , I feel like the lights don 't shine as bright in here . I feel like I 'm missing a part of myself . He was my compass . And I 'm afraid of where we 're going without it . I need it back . I 'm sorry for your loss , but you know you cannot replace your brother . No , you don 't understand . We have a need . And I have a candidate . I just want to see if he deserves a place at our table . ( SIGHS ) Do you think that you might go home while you 're out there ? No . I left that life . I don 't ever want to go back again . How do I look ? Like everybody else . ( BUZZING ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Hey , are you Peter Petrelli ? The paramedic who saved that cop 's life last week ? Yeah . That was awesome , man . Here . Thanks . What 's this ? You 've been served . Guess you need to be more careful when you 're saving people , hero . Oh , geez . ( RUMBLING ) ( RUMBLING STOPS ) ( CAT MEOWS ) ( PURRING ) Hmm ? You expecting somebody , Parkman ? Suspect 's house is over there . How damn long does it take a judge to issue a warrant ? We are gonna get this guy , okay ? We 're gonna find the stash , both get commendations . It 's gonna be a great day . Just relax . Yeah . It 's not even about that . I ... ( MATT SIGHS ) My 30 days sobriety chip . I slipped . I used . I 'm still being haunted by the ghost of all the crappy things I 've done past . And it got the better of me . ( CELL PHONE VIBRATING ) ADA . Yeah . I wish I was a ghost . It 'd be so much better than this hell , being stuck in your miserable life . ( SNORES ) I mean , have you seen yourself eat a burrito ? Why don 't you just get the hell out of here ? ( LAUGHS ) Well , there 's only one way out . Which is you need to figure out how to undo what you did , give me back my body , and I will be happy to leave you stewing in your mediocrity . You 're a killer . I 'm a cop . If I have to keep you trapped inside this prison for the rest of my life , so be it . You really think you 're up to the challenge ? You got no power . None . You 're annoying as hell , yes , but ultimately harmless . I can just ignore you until you fade away like a bad memory . We 'll see . ( SYLAR SNORING ) We got the warrant . Good . I want you on this job , but you are not going into that house until I know that you 'll keep it together . I 'm fine . Look . Huh ? It 's the first day of the rest of my life . Right ? So I put away my ghost and put my game face on . Let 's go . All right . MATT : Police . Open up . GREEN : Open up . Check over there . Hey . I 'll check upstairs . Parkman . ( GAS PS ) I 'm not interrupting you , am I ? I 'm everywhere . Hey . Where are you going ? He 's in the closet . Yeah . Your drug dealer is in that closet . What kind of cop doesn 't check a closet ? And he has a gun . ( GUN COCKS ) ( GUN FIRING ) You 're done . Drop it . Now . ( KEPPLER GROANS ) Okay . You 're welcome . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Gretchen , I told you that , .. Dad ? What are you doing here ? " Hey , Dad . Nice to see you . " Thanks for bringing the housewarming presents . " Hey , Dad . Nice to see you . Thanks for bringing the housewarming presents . ( GRUNTS ) You okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . Your mother told me about your roommate , Annie , committing suicide . I should 've called you . I know . I didn 't call because ... No , no , no . I ... I don 't want to put you on the spot . I just want to make sure you 're all right . I 'm dealing with it . I 'm fine . I know that " fine " . It 's not very convincing . You want to try again ? It 's not just the whole Annie thing . It 's just an adjustment , college . I 'm adjusting . I miss my family . I miss you , Mom . Even Lyle . What do you say we grab some lunch ? Spend a little time . Talk . If you 're not busy . No . Sounds like a plan . Let me just go get pretty . You look beautiful . ( GIGGLES ) I 'll be just a minute . GRETCHEN : So this is your plan ? You 're just going to avoid me ? I 'm not . Wow . You 're even going to avoid admitting you 're avoiding me . No , no , no . I 'm not . I was just busy and studying , and Organic Chem is a bitch . How 's Art History ? So we 're really not gonna talk about this ? Look , whatever it is you thought you saw the other night , you didn 't see . I didn 't see you hurl yourself out a window and then snap your bones back into place ? No . No . I mean , yes , I was on the ground . I was testing your theory . You know , Jump-Push-Fall . And I think Annie did commit suicide . Which is awful and tragic . You don 't have to lie to me . Look , you were wrong about Annie , just like you 're wrong about me . Seriously , what are you ? A vampire ? An alien ? Some kind of freakish government experiment ? All right . I just have to change . Great . Hi , Mr. Bennet . Hey . Who 's your friend ? That 's Gretchen . Nice to meet you . Yeah . Would you like to join us for lunch ? Oh ! That 's nice . You don 't ... You don 't have to do that . It would be my pleasure . I 'm pretty sure that Gretchen has an Art History assignment due tomorrow . Isn 't that right , Gretchen ? Yeah . But I finished my paper already . And I 'm starving . Great . Great . Great . Hey , we can do this the easy way or the hard way . So , why don 't you just tell us where you hid the drugs . Why don 't you ask my lawyer ? Did he just ... I can 't believe people actually say that . You can call your lawyer after we 're done searching the house . No , you can " : Do that , man . We have a warrant . You attempted to murder an officer , me , so we are gonna stay here as long as it takes . Or you could just grow a pair and end this idiotic sobriety . I 'm gonna ask you one more time . Stop asking . Use your abilities . ( SIGHS ) I 'm going to go check in the bathroom . Not as easy to ignore me as you thought . It 's because I ooze charm . You 're looking in the wrong place . Stop helping . Hey , if I 'm gonna be stuck in here , I might as well make the most of it . I always thought I 'd be an excellent cop . ( LAUGHS ) Fine . Ignore me . Something doesn 't fit in this picture . Stuffed rabbit ? The stuffed rabbit . This house isn 't used for drugs . It 's used for something worse . A lot worse . Hi . I need a file . Hooper , William . H-O-O-P-E-R . Look , it 'll just take a second . It 's my accident report . If you could just type it in . Seriously ? ( LAUGHS ) I get it . You 're just doing your job . And I 'm doing my job . I saved a guy 's life and he sues me for it . I guess no good deed goes unpunished . Right ? I 'm talking to myself . ( PRINTER WHIRRING ) Who 're you listening to ? Your headphones . It 's cool . I like that band , too . You okay ? Ha 's in physical therapy right now . Thank you . ( WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA ) Excuse me . William Hooper ? Yes . That 's me . I think there 's been a mistake . I 've never met you before . There 's no mistake , Mr. Petrelli . You pulled me from the 424 bus after it crashed at Lexington and 53rd . I remember you were fast , so fast , so negligent , you dislocated my arm . Well , I remember everybody that was on that bus . You weren 't on it . What is this , a scam ? You recognized my family name . You want money ? I 'm not scamming you . Don 't need your cash . Then what ? Empathy . I 'm in town because of my brother , Joseph . He died and ... ( LAUGHS ) There 's a lot of loose ends to take care of when someone passes . I 'm all alone now . I have to take care of our entire family . It 's my responsibility . It 's my burden . But I can 't do that on account of you . Doctor says I won 't work for months . If I don 't work , I don 't feed my family . Are you the kind of man that 's gonna allow my family to starve ? You know what , this was a mistake . I 'm gonna let the lawyers handle it . Good day . Working two , three shifts at a time . My lawyer already checked on you . I know what it 's like to feel the pressure of obligation . But isn 't it possible I was on that bus and you 've become so spread thin that you forgot ? No . It 's not . You 're not going blind , Emma . There 's nothing wrong with your eyes . ( IN SIGN LANGUAGE ) When you saw the lights , did other people see them ? Did you ever hear of synesthesia ? Yeah . Yeah . People say that they can smell words . Or hear numbers . It 's possible . It 's very common in deaf cases . Maybe your body is trying to tell you something . Emma . Emma , this is serious . You know , you 're completely disengaged . You file records when you could be treating patients . Is that why you wear the headphones ? Hey , I don 't want to see their faces . ( IN SIGN LANGUAGE ) Okay , we 've got saag paneer , baigan bhartha , aloo gobi , tikka masala . Seriously ? It just looks like green , brown , yellow and orange . Don 't make the stink face . You 're gonna love it . Except he forgot the raita . I don 't want to offend your dad , but what if I don 't like yellow ? Just do the napkin trick . Excuse me . We also had an order of raita for the table . Clever . You 're very good at hiding things . MR. BENNET : Could bring that over , please ? So , Gretchen , what 's your major ? Physiology and Bio-Mechanics . I thought it was Art History . I 'm gonna change . I 'm obsessed with the abilities of the human body . The other day , I saw this girl on YouTube . She was born with this gene that doesn 't let her feel any pain . Like , nothing . And her parents are freaked that she could cut her hand or bum herself and not even know . So , she 's totally cloistered . Pretty cool , huh ? It 's unusual , to say the least . So , what do you think , Claire ? Wanna audit some of these classes with me ? What do you think , Claire ? Why would I be interested in that ? Because it 's awesome . And we could do it together . And you 're still undeclared . Well , I can be undeclared till third year . Yeah . But that 's just like denying the inevitable . How long can you do that for ? You know , this yellow is really good . Yummy yellow . So , Mr. Bennet , what do you do ? Retired . But I 'm always finding new reasons to go back to work . ( MATT SIGHS ) Whose do you think this is ? I mean , it 's not his daughter . Would you let your kid play here ? Yeah . Me neither . Hey , I think these keys go to the garage . I 'm gonna go check it out . Okay , cool . I 'll keep an eye on him . MATT : ( WHISPERING ) Okay , tell me what the hell you think you know . Come on . Whose stuffed animal was that ? Is there a kid here ? Tell me . Hey . All right , what ? You 're ignoring me now ? Doesn 't feel very good , does it ? When somebody has something you want and they just won 't give it to you . I never intended for this to happen . ( IN NASAL VOICE ) Unless you did , Mr. Parkman . What the hell 's that supposed to mean ? Your life 's a mess , Matt . I 'm stuck inside your mind with your powers and all your anxieties . It 's sad . You 're so desperate for anyone to love you . Janice or your kid . And they never will love you . And you wanna know why ? ( SHOUTS ) Shut up . I didn 't say anything , man . Because you come in at a zero on the confidence scale . You 're always second-guessing yourself . Listen , I 'm innocent . Sweating every decision you make . Literally . I swear . SYLAR : You know what I think ? I think you wanted me in hereto help you . You wanted me to pick your sorry ass up out of the mud and help make you a man . SYLAR : Very good , detective . You found it all on your own . I 'm almost impressed . Now what are you gonna do , Matt ? Are you man enough to save her ? ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( SLURPING ) Well , you were right , Mr. Bennet . This was outstanding . Thank you . You 're welcome . That mango lassi just goes right through you . Excuse me . Okay , look ... I know things are difficult , but I can 't believe you told her about your ability . I didn 't tell her . She just found out . I gotta contact the Haitian . Erase Gretchen 's memory . Clean this mess up . Hey . Gretchen is not the enemy . She 's just a girl , and she 's the only friend that I 've made . I appreciate your concern , but I don 't need you fighting my battles for me . I can handle this . Really ? What 's your plan , Claire ? Stop . You make that phone call and I swear , I will banish you . I will not call . I will not e-mail . This is my mess , and I 'm gonna clean it up . So , what 's for dessert ? Where is she ? What are you talking about ? This is what I 'm talking about . The girl you wrote the ransom note for . Where is she ? There is no girl . Little girl 's life at stake , Parkman . We don 't have a lot of time . Use your power . Use your power . KEPPLER : Under the stairs . She 's under the stairs . ( GRUNTS ) ( PANTS ) What did you do ? What did you do ? What ? No . What 're you doing ? Parkman . Parkman . What the hell are you doing ? The girl . He killed a girl . Her body 's under the stairs . ( G ROANS ) GREEN : What girl ? The girl . The girl 's body , Mike . She 's right ... GREEN : What ? ( PANTING ) ( KEPPLER COUGHING ) The stuffed rabbit . Where 's the stuffed ... Pink stuffed rabbit . What ? ( SYLAR LAUGHS ) I used your own power against you . ( EXHALES ) You 're being sued ? This is a scam . This guy wasn 't even in that bus crash . Well , according to my log , he was . Look , the hospital is not gonna take the fall on this . They 're gonna blame you . For what ? I 've been nothing but committed . Yeah , I know . You 're everywhere . And always the first on scene . What 's that supposed to mean ? There 's a couple people floating the theory that you caused the accidents yourself . Glory hounding . So what ? You believe them ? They ask if you 've been reckless . They ask if you 've been behaving suspiciously . You have . Hesam , come on . You know me . We 're partners . Partners ? Man , you run off the second we get on scene . I 'm your chauffeur . ( CHUCKLES ) ( DOOR UNLOCKING ) PETER : He was on the bus . Look , Claire , I 'm sorry if I pushed too hard . I push . I 'm pushy . You think ? You don 't want to talk . I get that . Wanting to keep a secret that got out . ( SIGHS ) When I was in junior high , the girls called me Retchin ' Gretchen . That 's a terrible nickname . Yeah . They said that I smelled like puke because I was bulimic . Wow , I can 't believe they would make that up . ( LAUGHS ) Yeah . " Made it up . " I 'll see you around . Gretchen . I really , really want to trust you , but my life has been a complex series of disasters . And it 's been a really , really long time since I felt safe enough to tell anyone the truth . But I 'm tired of keeping this secret to myself . So ask me anything . I 'll tell you the truth . ( WHOOSHING ) Mr. Petrelli . I didn 't expect to sea you again . You look like you 've been running all over the city . I need to apologize to you . ( PANTS ) You were on that bus . I made a mistake and I am sorry . Thank you . I 'm gonna make it right . No need to concern yourself . There must be something I can do . Have you ever lost a brother ? ( SIGHS ) No . No , I haven 't . I used to work hospice . I used to help families through the worst pain imaginable . Joseph and I grew up nearby . I thought I 'd go back home to remember the good times . Can 't bring yourself to go ? Too many bad memories mixed in with the good . My trip here started as one thing but it turned into something else . Can 't seem to find any solace anywhere . Grieving is messy . I saw it all the time . People can offer their condolences , they can tell you they 're sorry for your loss , but they don 't know what it is that you 're feeling . What would you say to people ? Just sit with them . Be with them . I 'd let them know that they 're not alone . So , what made you become a paramedic ? I wanted to save lives instead of watching them pass . You 're exactly who I hoped you 'd be . I 'm dropping the lawsuit . Thank you , Peter . For everything . You know , it 's not for nothing , but if you made the trip all the way out here , I really think that you should visit your home . I think I will . ( PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC ) ( MUSIC ECHOING ) ( MUSIC FADES ) ( PLAYS LOW NOTE ) ( PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC ) ( INAUDIBLE ) ( PIANO PLAYING ) ( DOORBELL RINGS ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Sorry to bother you at this hour . But I grew up here . My father used to be the butler , my mother was the maid . My brother recently passed away , and I just thought I could take a look around . Well , not here , but in the carriage house . We 're actually in the middle of a dinner party . Please . This really is not a good time . Sorry for your loss . ( PEOPLE LAUGHING ) ( GRETCHEN LAUGHS ) So , wait , you 're telling me that you 've never been drunk ? Because that 's , like , 85 % of the college experience . I know . Just doesn 't work on me . I heal too quickly . But the good thing is you will always have a designated driver . ( LAUGHS ) Can I see it ? See what ? The healing ? If that 's not crossing a line . The hand 's always the favorite . Go for it . I 've never done this before . Well , I would hope not . ( LAUGHS ) It 's okay . ( SCREAMS ) Oh , my God . Oh , my God . I 'm so sorry . Are you okay ? ( LAUGHS ) I 'm just kidding . I 'm sorry , that was mean . I 'm fine . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) I have to take this . I 'll be right back . Dad , I 've got everything under control , okay ? And I told Gretchen everything about everything and I know that you 're gonna be mad , but this was my choice . Lt 's not just us anymore , and I 'm gonna have other people in my life , friends and boyfriends , and I can 't close myself off with lies . Did you rehearse that speech ? Yes . I wanted to get it right . No , it was good . Listen , I think I owe you an apology . I was a bit harsh earlier at the restaurant . A bit ? Okay , two bits . ( SIGHS ) it 's just ... When I look at you , I can 't help seeing my Claire-bear . And when you get into any kind of trouble , I feel this instinct to protect you . Well , you can 't do that now . I don 't think I can ever really do it again . Not like before . Look , I will always be here for you . Always . But you 're right . You can handle your own problems now . And I 'll try to worry about myself from now on . Thanks . Good night , Dad . Good night , Claire . Good night . ( LAUGHS ) Can I borrow this ? No . Right . Sorry . No , I mean , yes . Yes , but ... Well , you won 't have to borrow it , because it 'll be here . Do you want to be my roommate ? ( LAUGHS ) Let me think . Rooming with a boring girl who smells like pickles , or the super-girl who 's got excellent taste in literature ? ( LAUGHS ) Well , all right then , roomie . ( LAUGHS ) I just ... I don 't see any other way out of this . You crossed a line , Matt . What 's gonna happen to me , Mike ? You need to find yourself a damn good lawyer . This is gonna ruin my life . I 'm sorry . Yeah . Me , too . ( SIGHS ) What are you doing ? I guess I 'm just not strong enough anymore . Nothing happened here . He attacked you , I stopped him . That 's all . Go call it in . I 'll go call it in , Matt . SYLAR : I 'm proud of you . You 're finally becoming more like me . Today is the first day of the rest of your life . And they can all be like this . Or you and I can go find my body . ( MAN CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO ) ( SIREN WAILING ) Wait up . Sorry to make you boys come out . Three people died here . Could have been a lot worse . PETER : So , what happened ? Sinkhole . Sinkhole ? ( GROANS )

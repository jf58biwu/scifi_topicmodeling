 How did it happen ? How did the world get swallowed up so quickly ? ' Bill ! It was because we had our eyes closed . Even when we could see . Billy ! And we let them get too close . Bill ! It had been 30 years since my mother was killed by a triffid . She was trying to understand them . I 've been doing the same ever since . For me , it 's always been personal . For the rest of the world , the triffids were simply a practical solution . They contained an oil that quickly replaced fossil fuels . Triffids became man 's best friend . But they didn 't see the consequences . And I couldn 't get them to listen . I 'm disconnecting this triffid . Confirmed . Triffid tether de-activated . Dr. Masen , you 're clear to start your reaction test . Still trying to get something else out of the triffs , Dr. Bill ? Well , yes . I suppose I am . You really think they can hear ? More like they can feel the sound waves . The reaction time ... The triffids are getting faster with every new generation . They seem to be evolving on their own . Lucy ... Yeah ? Taser . Sorry . Thank you . Breeding triffids for their oil came at a price . The oil companies were forced to lock them away and keep the world in the dark . Paper records check . Sure . Can I see your papers ? There were those who thought we shouldn 't interfere with Mother Nature . Yet were ignorant to the danger that waited inside the refinery walls . Waiting for the chance to be free . We have an orchard security breach . Received and understood . Tether the triffid . Do not enter the orchard without back-up . Negative . They 'll never last that long . I 'm going in now . All units to the orchard immediately . Head of Security needs urgent assistance . Get back ! Stay back , or she gets that again ! So what goes on in here , then ? What are you hiding ? Put her glasses back on and then we can talk . Glasses ? Please , put them on . Please . I don 't think so . Put mine on her . Please ! You do it . I know who you are ! Dr. Bill Masen . I bet the triffids know exactly what you are . You should listen to them , Doctor . Huh . You might learn something , instead of stealing their oil , messing with their genes . What 's wrong ? You lost your tongue ? Huh ? You got an opinion , Doctor ? People need to know what 's going on in here ! Get him out of here ! Get him out of here ! Look at the sky ! Stay where you are . Don 't move . Look at the sun ! Look at it ! Open the door ! Let me go ! Get out of the way ! Bill . Thank God . I thought I 'd lost you . Must have been a young plant . Venom sac 's not fully developed yet . You hold on in there , Dr. Bill . We 'll be in London soon . They say it 'll be the greatest light show ever . Northern lights seen as far south as Hawaii , a veritable rainbow of comets . But is it another result of the global cooling triffid scientists have been boasting about , or something else ? With me is astrophysicist Edward Vorless . Welcome , Professor . So , tell me , do we have the triffids to thank for the fireworks , too ? Oh , we can certainly thank the triffids , or at least their marvellous oil for saving us from global warming . But the fireworks , no . So , what is the cause ? The sun . Tonight we will see its true power . It will unleash a solar storm . An unbelievably vast explosion of gas and nuclear fire that will send billions of tons of irradiated plasma shooting towards the Earth . And is there any risk to us ? Any precautions we should take ? Only if you are a satellite . We humans will suffer no harm . We should sit back and enjoy the fireworks . Well , thank you , Professor . So tonight we 'll be covering this phenomenon from round the globe . My bosses are even putting me on camera . You know , you people should come clean abut how dangerous these plants are . Tell me , why do triffids always go for the eyes ? I don 't know . Well , you should find out . Cos I 'd say you have a 50-50 chance of losing your sight . Or of keeping it . Hello , I 'm Jo Playton , coming to you from the heart of London . And the sky really is quite spectacular . It 's like the aurora borealis , only a lot brighter ... We can see the bloody sky , Jo . Talk to some people . Get them on camera . 3 , 2 , 1 ... Then , we 're gonna ' go to Sydney . Jim , you 're up . Jo , bring him in . .. happening millions of miles away . Later , I 'll be talking to people here and getting their reactions . But now , let 's go over to Jim Watts in Sydney . OK , Jim . The sun is so bright , it 's really hard to see the sky . Jo , get yourself down the Tube . Talk to some people who are ignoring this whole damn thing . Make it entertaining , will you , love ? All right , I 'm trying . I 'll be back for you , Dr. Bill . How long will he be out for ? At least 24 hours . Shame he 'll miss the light show . Is everything OK ? Yeah . Looks like it 's about to start . I 've often dreamt about that night . About what it would have looked like . Some said it was glorious , as if the heavens ignited and God himself was conducting the show . It 's started and it 's unbelievable . We never expected anything like this . And we get reports that it 's the same all over the world . Pauline , what 's happening here ? Is this us or is it them ? Come on , people , why are we losing these ? And there 's another one . Can someone tell me what 's going on ? Paris has gone . Moscow , Moscow 's gone . I don 't know , I have no idea . 12 : 03 . That was the time , the hour and the minute when the world went dark . When the world changed . When the clock started ticking , counting down . Hello ? Nurse ! Are you a doctor ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . But , no ... I need you to look at my eyes . Yes , well I 'm not that kind of a doctor . Ah , Shut up . What 's happening ? What 's going on ? You have a 50-50 chance of losing your sight . ... at least 24 hours ... You people should come clean how dangerous these plants are . ... You have a 50-50 chance of losing your sight ... Tell me , why do triffids always go for the eyes ... You people should come clean at least 24 ... ... losing ... ... dangerous You have ... . 50-50 ... 24 hours ... chance ... At least 24 hours ... You have a ... Tell me , why do triffids always go for the eyes ? Could all passengers return to their seats immediately ? Please fasten your seatbelt and assume the crash position . Could all passengers return to their seats immediately ? Please fasten your seatbelts and assume the crash position . Billy ! Yes ! Somebody , just bring help ! Help ! Matthew ? Matthew ? Matthew , is that you ? No . No , it 's not Matthew . They did something to my eyes . I need to find a doctor . There aren 't any . I want to go home . Listen , I 'm going to go and find out what 's happened and then I 'll come back for you , OK ? Oh , no . No , please . Please . I will come back . Please ... Would all staff adopt Code 17 procedure . Would all staff adopt Code 17 procedure . Dr. Kotch ! Dr. Kotch , it 's Bill . Bill Masen . You operated on me yesterday . On my eyes . You can see ? Yes , I can see . You can see . What 's happening ? What 's happening ? Everyone 's blind , but not you ! What ? I don 't understand . What do you mean , everyone 's blind ? It must have been the sun , the solar storm . Everyone staring at the sky . You couldn 't watch it , could you ? I 'll get help . I 'll get help . Look , there must be someone who knows what 's going on . I 'll get help ! Let me go . Listen to me . Let me go ! Listen to me ! Would all staff adopt Code 17 procedure . ... my sight . I 've lost it . I 've lost it . Attention , please . Due to a reported emergency , would all passengers leave the station immediately Simon ? Simon ! Attention , please . Due to a reported emergency , would all passengers leave the station immediately Hello ? Attention , please . Help ! Due to a reported emergency , would all passengers leave the station immediately Anyone here ? Help ! .. all passengers ... Give it back . Uh , let me help you . It 's mine ! Yes . Here it is . Mum ! Here we are . Sorry . Can you see ? Yeah . I can , but ... I don 't understand . What 's happened ? We can 't see . Nobody can . Have you heard any news ? The TV and radio went off . But if there were more people like you ... What do you mean like me ? Come home with us . Please . I 'd like to , but ... Please . Can you see for us ? Can she see ? Can you , love ? I have to get home myself . I ... Come with me ! Help me find food . No , we were talking to her . Help me first ! Then you can go home , all right . I know her voice . Let go of me ! She 's on the radio . I mean it ! It 's Jo Playton . She 's getting away ! Jo ? Where are you going ? Please ... Please , please . She 's going . Jo ! She 's getting away ! Wait ! Where 's she going ? Thank God . Things were getting crazy there . It 's been a bit crazy everywhere . What are you doing ? You 're drunk . No . You 're blind ! Not any more I 'm not . Get in the car ! Officer ! Officer , I need ... I need help . Go to the police station ! What 's she done ? Under arrest . No ! No ! No ! Where is she ? Please ! Don 't let him go ! Hold that man ! Please ! Please ! He 's got my gun ! Where is she ? I didn 't think there was anyone else . Anyone to help . You OK ? Thank you . I 'm- - I 'm Jo . Bill . Bill Masen . Will you be all right ? Where are you going ? Whitehall . I have to find someone in authority who knows what 's happening . I mean , who knows how long the power 's going to last ? The power ? Isn 't that the least of our worries ? The electricity on the farms could go down . The farms ? The triffid farms . Help ! Help ! Pick up the phone ! Come on . Hello ? Who are you ? What are you doing ? Who are you ? Soon be free . Nothing . No network . Shit ! God . Is it just us ? That 's what we need to find out . How come you missed the show ? I was in hospital , for an eye operation . What is that ? Can we get through ? No . This is a secure area ! But we 're sighted . There are no sighted left . Well . You 're what ? 5 ' 10 " , ginger hair . And you look just as scared as the rest of us . Please let us in . If I let you in , will you check if there 's anyone else inside ? Why aren 't you letting us in ? We need help . Food . Water . Stay where you are . Sergeant ! Let us through ! That 's enough . Now get back . Why aren 't you letting us in ? Stay where you are ! Get back or my men will shoot ! Now get back . Get back from the gates . I 've got his gun ! Get off ! That 's government ? Blind policemen shooting each other ? I 've got to get to my dad . I 've got to make sure he 's OK . Well , you must have family , right ? Someone close ? No . I have to get going . Where to ? Back to where I work . The world 's falling apart and you have to check on some plants . Triffids aren 't just some plants . So ... I 'll say goodbye and ... No . No . Don 't ! No . I need to get a car . Then we go together . Please ? Yeah . Come on , Daddy . This one . Power can 't have failed this soon . It doesn 't make sense . What did this ? Triffids . I don 't understand . You 're telling me that triffids can move ? And do this to people ? Yes . Keep your eyes open and keep moving . The orchard 's been breached as well . What is this place ? It 's where the male triffids are confined . Or it should be . Stay close . What happened to him ? Triffids are carnivores . They eat people . Did you know him ? No . No . He 's the idiot who let them out . Oh , no . Not Lucy . She fought . She was blind , but she fought . I 'm sorry . Was she your ... ? She was my friend . You people knew . You knew that they were dangerous and yet it never got out . Triffid oil saved the world from global warming . You think it would have made any difference if you had known ? But if ... At least you have a generator . Until the Triffoil runs out . There 's a sofa . You should get some rest . What are you going to do ? I need to get my research before it 's too late . Bill , will you take me to my dad 's ? He lives near Windsor . It 's miles from the triffid farms . Yeah . I spent my whole life working with triffids , trying to make sense of them . And now my obsession seemed more important than ever . What 's that sound ? Triffid recordings . They 're communicating . So what are they saying ? That 's what I 've been trying to work out . It 's the basis of my research . This device contains years of triffids ' communications . I 've proved there 's signs of evolving intelligence . So far I 've failed to work out what they 're saying . And now they 're free . Come on . Let 's get your dad . How many farms are there ? Across the world ? Tens of thousands . In England , 500 . Each one holds about 20,000 triffids . 10 million meat-eating plants . How do they reproduce ? Same as other plants . The males pollinate the females . That 's why it was essential that we controlled the males . And now they 're out . Dad ! Dad ? Dad , it 's me , Jo ! Dad ? Dad ? Dad ! Jo ! Dad ! Dad ! Jo , stop ! Dad ! Stop ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Jo ! Stop ! Jo ! Dad ! Jo ! No ! Don 't ! Don 't . Do something ! There 's nothing we can do . He 's dead ! We have to get out of here . They 're everywhere , Jo ! No , he can 't be dead . You bastard ! He 's my dad ! Give it to me . I shouldn 't have left you . Jo . Jo , we have to get out of here . Come on . If we stay here , they 'll kill us , too . Come on . They 're all around us . Jo , we have to go . Bill , stop the car . That 's when we knew that our day was over and the day of the triffids had begun . We need to warn people . Bill , go over there . This is an emergency broadcast from the BBC in London . Most of the people in the United Kingdom , and we believe the world , have been struck blind . There is no government . But there is a bigger threat to us at this time . With me is triffid expert , Dr. Bill Masen . Dr. Masen , what do people need to know about the triffids ? They 're extremely dangerous . And how are they dangerous ? What do they do ? Well , triffids are large , carnivorous plants that can move independently . But because of the blinding , they 've escaped and so they 're no longer being fed on the farm . They 've started ... They 've started to ... We know that they have started to attack and eat people . They have a fatal sting capable of reaching up to 15ft . And they make a distinctive rustling tick-tocking kind of noise . So if you hear or see one , you must keep your distance . Where do you think that the triffids are heading ? They 'll gravitate towards the cities , to where the most abundant source of food is ... us . So , if you are sighted , then arm yourselves and do what you can to protect those around you , especially the blind , and ... tell anyone that you can . My parents were botanists and they researched the triffids in Zaire . I was 6 , so I was with them . It was my father that saw , with ... some genetic modification , the tremendous opportunity for oil production . So he brought them back ? All of this is his fault . Well , no . He provided us with a cheap , endlessly replaceable , pollution-free source of fuel that solved the energy crisis . He saved the world . My mother felt differently . Where are they now ? Well , I haven 't seen my father for years . We don 't get on . And my mother ... she died in Zaire ... of a triffid sting . Billy ! This really is it , isn 't it ? I 'm afraid so . To the future . No . To the past . It was beautiful ... and we didn 't take care of it . Hello ? Who are you ? I 'm from MI5 . I 'd like to see the Prime Minister . This is where he lives , isn 't it ? You 'll need to make an appointment . Of course . Hilda . Who are you ? I 'm Torrence . I 'll just have a look round . But you can 't ... Excuse me . Excuse me ! You OK ? Yeah . Yeah . I 'm brilliant . I 'll be next door . You know what ? If it 's all the same , would you stay in here ? Morning , Hilda . You can 't stay here . Well ... the PM 's not coming back , I take it . Out running the country ? He 's gone . They all have . Well , then there 's just you and me . There must be others . There 's an emergency broadcast on the radio . Well , play it for me , Hilda . With me is triffid expert , Dr. Bill Masen . Dr. Masen , what do people need to know about the triffids ? They 're extremely dangerous . And how are they dangerous ? What do they do ? Well , triffids are large , carnivorous plants that can move independently . But because of the blinding ... Haven 't got anything to eat , have you ? A sandwich ? I 'll make it . Then we can go for a little drive . Jo . Jo , wake up . Just saw 2 flares coming from the city . A signal ? Yeah . This means there 's other people . People like us . People who can see . Triffids . Yeah , they 're moving faster than I thought . They 're only a couple of miles from the city . Bill , who is that ? Hello . Hi . I 'm Torrence . Heard on the radio there 's a bit of panic developing about triffids . Judging from the mess here , I think they 're right . Help yourself to guns . We could do with some weapons . I 'm Jo . Are you on your own ? Why do you ask ? We 're going to the city . We believe there 's a sighted group there . Tell you what , why don 't you come and join my group ? Who 's in it ? Me . I think we 're fine on our own . OK . See you down the road . Torrence ? Yeah ? How come you can see ? Luck . I 'm a naval engineer . Military submarines . Got caught doing a routine maintenance when all that went up . People I was with ... Well ... Enjoy the weather . Jo ... Enchanté . Seatbelt on , please , Hilda . Is this justice ? To leave the rest of your fellow citizens in the dark ? Do you think you 're special ? These people aren 't good enough ? Where 's your British sense of fair play ? Look at them ! Are we supposed to just stand by and let them die ? We have to help . I 've done everything I can to keep these people fed and safe . But I can 't do it on my own ! Everyone who can see can easily look after those who can 't . One day they 'll find a cure and these people will find out who helped and who looked away . These people have every right to live , the same as you ! That 's enough . You and your friends must move along . We 're not going anywhere . Come on , guys . Release her . My men will shoot . Shoot the blind ? You wouldn 't dare . Over their heads , one round . Leave or the next ones will hit . Don 't you have any compassion ? You don 't deserve to have your sight . None of you do . It 's not over . What should we do ? I need to know if these people can help . Go ahead . Crawl in there with the rest of the cowards . There are 30 of us so far , all sighted and another 10 highly-skilled , blind . We expect more will come . And we have our own generator . Who are you ? Michele Beadley . I work for the Home Office . So there is still a government ? No . There 's just us . If you want to join us , you 'll have to pull your weight . Do what , exactly ? To forage for essential supplies . The colonel has lists of what we need . And what plans have you made to defend yourselves against the triffids ? I 'm more concerned about our nuclear power stations than triffids , Mr. Masen . It 's Dr. Masen , and nuclear power stations can 't move ; triffids can . The triffids will stay on the farms . They won 't and they 're not . Excuse me ? I 've read the official research . In the event ... That research was commissioned by the Triffoil companies . Triffids need food , meat . If it 's not there , they 'll go and get it . And the biggest available source of food is us . They 're large , slow , easy to avoid . Not if you 're blind . Triffids have been genetically modified to die within 3 years , and the male plants are under strict control on the farms . Kingston Farm was sabotaged and the male plants have escaped . And when they start to pollinate the females the situation will be catastrophic . Which will take what , months , weeks ? It could be days . Well , whatever emergency plans there were , they clearly can 't be implemented . Therefore our priorities remain as food , fuel , weapons and accommodation . And what about the triffids ? Well , you 're the expert . What would you do ? Don 't worry . I promised to look after you and I will , one way or another . Yep . I 'm Torrence . I 'm Steve . Hi . Cory . Hi . You gotta ' meet Major Coker . Major Coker . I 'm Torrence . Torrence , hey . I was driving . I saw you . Need any help ? You bet . The blind won 't survive on their own . So we 're planning to round up all the sighted we can , if they want to help or not . Have you seen Dr. Masen ? No . Let 's come to order . OK , let 's begin . We face what happened to Britain when the Romans left , 1600 years ago . Everything will crumble - roads , railways , hospitals . This is our proposal . We find somewhere in the country and then we start to rebuild . Have you had news from other countries ? Is there any help on its way ? We think what happened here happened everywhere . We 're not expecting any help from outside . And what about the blind ? I 'm afraid we have no plans for them . What ? We have no alternative . We are too few , they are too many . We can 't look after them . We can 't feed them . I see no way to save them . And no point in dying with them . It 's wrong . It 's so wrong . Bill ? You 're leaving ? Where are you going ? To my father 's place in Shirning . I 've got to work out how to deal with them . Well , you 'd better go then . Look , it 's not my first choice ... it 's my only choice . You know , I 'm clutching at straws . He may not even have survived . I don 't know . His ... . You know . His original research , it might help . But we 're running out of time . I 'm coming with you . Jo . Jo ... You might not agree with Beadley , but you 'll have a much better chance of survival if you stay with her . She 's wrong . What they 're doing is ruthless . Jo , you need people . I don 't need these people . You 'll be safer with her . Jo ... we were an accident . We met by accident but ... we stayed together on purpose , didn 't we ? I 'll get the gate ! Remember , tear gas and smoke grenades only ! I don 't want to hurt them ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Tear gas ! Get off ! Jo . Get off me ! Bill ! Get off me ! Get off me ! Bill ! Torrence ! Get him out of here ! Bill ! Take him out ! Take him out ! Bill . Yeah , turn around . Yeah , look at me . Look at me . Look at me . Can you stand ? Yeah . Hold on . Attention , all sighted . Each of you will be handcuffed to a blind citizen . Bring it up . It is now your job to keep them alive . Great . Move . I 'm Jeff . Sorry about all this . Don 't be . It 's not your fault . I used to be a mechanic . Weren 't a bad old life as long as it lasted . Well , I guess I 'm one of the lucky ones . Why , because you can still see ? Rather you than me , mate . Hey . Sorry about the strong-arm tactics , but you weren 't going to help us of your own accord . Coker , what 's going on ? You 've been split into groups . The sighted will take care of the blind . Make sure they have food and shelter . We 're going to divide London into sections . And what do you plan to do in these sections ? I mean , about the triffids ? The triffids aren 't our priority . Yeah , well , they should be . We 've seen what they can do and so has he . What matters now is organization . What 's your role in all of this ? My role ? I thought you said you were on your own . Then I met Major Coker . His plan to take over London interests me . Sorry , Jo . All right . Guides will take you to your sections . Let 's load up , guys . Look after Hilda for me , Jo ! We got to load the trucks . Double time , everybody . Torrence , come on , help out . Guides will lead you to your sections . Let 's load up . Here we go . I 'll get moving when I 'm good and ready . Get in the truck . Here we go . Coker sent sighted and blind to forage for food and water . His heart was in the right place , but he was ignoring the threat of the encroaching triffids , delaying me from getting to Shirning and the solution I was hoping to find there . ' Everybody out ! Move it , people ! Come on ! You and you , you 're coming with me . Let 's do it . Where are we going ? We 're going in ! In the door ! All right ! All right ! Come on ! I 'm going ! I 'm going ! Anybody in ? What 's that ? Who 's here ? Nice and easy . Watch your backs . Wouldn 't want to see you get hurt . Don 't shoot ! Come on . Come on . Come on . Son of a ... Put that down ! You stupid idiot ! No ! All right . There 's no food here ! We 're taking over your pub , psycho . What 's your name ? Vronsky . You got to pay . We don 't got to do nothing . What you doing , you ... prat ? That 's disturbing . What is it ? It 's triffid recordings . Something I 've been working on . Discover anything interesting ? Maybe . As long as it isn 't attracting them to us . I thought Major Coker said they weren 't important ? Major Coker wants to talk to you , Jo . Me ? Why ? Read your name off the list . Realized you were behind the emergency broadcast . He 'd like you to do another . It seems you 're the famous Jo Playton . I always thought there was something special about you . No , I just work on the radio , that 's all . Well , that 's the thing . See , Major Coker was in the US Air Force . Appreciates the ... uh the uh ... importance of clear communication . Good for Major Coker , but tell him I 'm fine where I am . Look , Jo , people know your voice . We think we can get a transmitter going and you can talk to the people . You can reassure the afflicted , just like you 're doing with Hilda . Yeah , well , thanks for the offer , but like I said , I 'm fine where I am . You heard what she said , Torrence . OK . Major Coker 's going to be very disappointed . Seems you prefer hanging out with Dr. Masen than saving your country . Charlie ... right here , buddy . Jackpot . Everybody out . How 'd you know about this place ? Charlie led us here . I worked here half my life before the blinding . Night watchman . Not much of a night watchman now . All right , Osman . Rope up . Coker ... Coker . Will you shut up about the triffids and help ? Charlie , you 're the watchman . Stay here and watch . 3 groups . Osman , Cheryl , Vronsky , get water . Jo , Hilda , canned goods . Bill , medical supplies . Got it ? What d 'you think ? Keep your eyes open . That supposed to be funny ? Hey , Torrence , come in . It 's Coker . Reading you , Major . We need you to come to the warehouse and give us back-up . This place is full of supplies . Understood . We 're going to need a bigger car . So what was it like being a star ? Shut up , Hilda . Vronsky , come on . Make it quick . Yeah ... Coker ? Coker ? Stay here . What 's this ? Jeez ... What 's that smell ? Rotting meat . Would someone tell me what 's happ ... ? Be quiet ! Shut up ! Triffids . Where are you going ? To get Jo . Come on . Charlie ? Charlie , are you there ? Charlie ! Come on ! Charlie ! Come on ! Osman ? ! Anyone ? ! My arm ! Hang on ! Help ! No ! No ! No ! Hang on ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Get back ! Come on ! Come on , let 's go ! My leg ! I think it 's broken . Please ! Shut up . Don 't leave me ! Osman ? Osman ? Osman ! Don 't leave me ! Osman ! Come on , faster , faster ! Faster ! My leg ! They just left me . Come on , Hild ' ! Come on ! She 's gone . Jo , she 's gone . Come on ! Get her in the van ! Is this what you wanted ? Is it ? Is this what you wanted ? ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I should have listened . You 've got to get to Shirning , with or without me . Hey ! Your man Osman is a coward . And I want Bill Masen on our team . You get him whatever he needs to deal with the triffids . Of course , mate . Excellent idea . Leave it to me . Come on . OK , kids ... We 're leaving . Jo , you OK ? I 'm all right . But if it wasn 't for Bill , I wouldn 't even be here now . Yes , he 's quite the hero , isn 't he ? And he 's our only hope against the triffids . Ah . You wanted to see me ? I did . About the radio broadcast for Major Coker . I changed my mind and if there 's anything I can do to help , I 'd like to do it before Bill and I leave for his father 's . Well ... He will be delighted . What would be fantastic is if you could record something right now . Right now ? Yeah . OK . Excellent . After you . Hey , Jeff . What are you doing ? I 'm leaving . Does Coker know ? I 'm going to see him now . Hello . This is Radio Britain and I 'm Jo Playton coming to you live from London . Please listen carefully to the following announcement . Triffids are now known to have reached major cities across the country . As you know , these plants can and will kill humans . Therefore , Major Coker has asked that every citizen , both sighted and unsighted , help to fight them . Will all volunteers please register with Army personnel who will make themselves known to you in your area . I repeat . This is Jo Playton , coming to you live from London .

I want to see him . No , you don 't . I mean ... It was a vicious attack . Major Coker says he 's very sorry . OK , let 's ... Go on then , chuck them out . Do it . C 'mon , help me ... . Come on ! Get out now ! Out ! Now ! Come on ! Come on , then . C 'mon . Give me the keys . Give me the damn keys . Now move in front of me . Get in front of me . Do it . END OF PART 1 . NEXT TIME ... . Is Bill Masen alive ? Is he ? When you 're better , you 'll see clearly . I was thinking today about missed opportunities . Sometimes you have to act . I 'm Jo Playton , and you 're not alone . Find her ! Just because the whole world 's gone crazy doesn 't mean we can 't have a little bit of fun . Outside these walls is chaos . Try and shoot Masen . Maybe we 'll have to accept triffids really are the dominant species . I 'll get you a male triffid . Mother Nature 's finally taking her revenge and reclaiming the planet . It had been 30 years since my mother was killed by a triffid . She was trying to understand them . I 've been doing the same ever since . Hello . I 'm Jo Playton coming to you from the heart of London . Why do triffids always go for the eyes ? Dr. Kotch , it 's me , Bill Masen . What 's happening ? This is an emergency broadcast from the BBC . Most of the people in the world have been struck blind . There is no government . These people have every right to live ! Over their heads . I 'm Torrence . Hear there was a bit of panic about triffids . Triffids are carnivorous plants that can move . Their most abundant source of food is us . I 've got to get to my father 's place in Shirning if we 're going to work out how to deal with them . Help ! You 've got to get to Shirning , with or without me . Masen , you 're under arrest ! Being taken up to the Heath . It 's all Torrence . He 's running the whole show now . It was a vicious attack . He 's dead , Jo . Where 'd you think you 're going , boys ? Stay where you are ! Don 't move ! Ain 't going to tell you again . What have got in your hands , Masen ? Show me your hands ! Show me ! Masen , you ... Let 's go ! The triffids , they are coming . Bill ... Bill , wake up . The engine 's had it . The weather 's getting worse . We 're gonna ' have to walk . Try and find some shelter . At least the snow will slow them down . Triffids have been engineered to survive in any weather . This is Radio Britain calling to you live from London . Calling all citizens - men , women and children . If you are sighted , help the blind . Come to London . Here you 'll find safety , food and shelter . Gathering points have been set up around the M25 . Make your way there and you 'll be safe . I 'm Jo Playton . And you are not alone . Need some help . Are there any others ? No . Shut the gates . Where is he ? Lead me to him . Here , he 's been shot in the shoulder . Thank you , Father Thomas . I 'll clean the wound and close it , then you 'll need some serious rest . You 're lucky your friend brought you here . I was lucky I found you . I don 't believe in luck . Mother Superior . You were meant to come here , meant to be cured . Body and soul . I hope you will stay . Here , we are all equal . When you 're better , you 'll see clearly . London will seem like another world . Who 's in charge in London ? We don 't get any news . There 's no London now , Father Thomas . There 's only us . If I was going to make it to Shirning , I had to stop , regain my strength . But I knew the triffids would never rest . They would continue to hunt us down , find populated places , march towards London . Towards Jo . Are we winning ? Yes . So my messages are getting through ? Absolutely . More every day . Let me explain all this . The blue areas , right , we control . The red areas , we defend . Green is triffids . That 's an awful lot of green . Well , it 's still the safest place in the country . The important thing is that we survive . I mean , you 're still here . I 'm still here . Yeah . I wish Bill was . He could have helped us . Yeah , well , Bill 's dead , all right ? And you say that Major Coker 's too busy running the country ? I mean , what 's his plan ? The broadcasts were his idea , after all . Well , to be honest , Major Coker 's struggling . I mean it 's people like you and me that are keeping things going . I mean , you have done brilliantly . You 're bringing them in . That 's what they say , " I heard Jo on the radio . " " I heard her voice , that 's why I came . " Have dinner with me . Dinner ? Yeah . Just ... just the 2 of us . As if everything was just normal ? It 's the way you survive - by insisting everything 's normal . By refusing to give in . Sheer force of will . That 's why they follow me - they know I 'll never give in . Follow you ? Just because the whole world 's gone crazy doesn 't mean we can 't have a little bit of fun . Well , you know what ? That is really sweet of you . Maybe next time . OK ? OK . How long have they been there ? At least as long as we have . I don 't understand . Why aren 't they hunting ? Food must be getting scarce and there 's so much of it in the abbey . Yeah , I asked her about that and she said ... She ? Durrant . She 's the Mother Superior . She 's in charge here . I want to see her . Go with peace in your heart , dear Father Thomas . Father , come along . It 's always sad when first-class people have to go . But he wanted to spread the word . Father Thomas will find more survivors , he will begin a new community and build on what we 've done here . Well , he 's a brave man . You 're looking much better , Dr. Masen . Yes , I 'm much stronger now , thank you . Major Coker tells me you 're a triffid expert . Well ... Yes . The triffids , out there in the country , were they always so passive ? First , they were quite troublesome . I lost many friends . But then God intervened . Really ? How did God do that ? He answered our prayers . When the peaceful nature of our community became clear , the triffids returned to the wood and killed no more . Do you know , I 've been amongst triffids all my life . And ... I 've never known them to behave like that . We strive to live in harmony with nature . We intend no harm . They seem content with that . I was in your cellar . You know you have a generator down there ? I could get it going for you . Get you proper lighting , heating ... No . I don 't think so . But it would make things easier . Come . Look , look , look , look . Look at that tower . Men built that tower long before there was electricity or power tools . It wasn 't easy , but it stands . I don 't want things to be easy . I want them to be right . What are you doing ? Leaving to go to my father 's . I need some help with the triffids . But they 're quiet here . You heard what she said . She may be a little eccentric , but if she 's figured out a way to co-exist with them , then what 's ... By being " peaceful " ? We 've both seen what the triffids can do . Look , Coker , they 've got over 50 beehives out there . All it takes is warmer weather , then the triffids will be pollinated . And then they 'll spore and we 'll have hundreds and thousands of new plants . Durrant and the rest of the world won 't stand a chance . If we don 't find a way to defeat the triffids , the human race will become extinct . I 've marked the safe path through the woods . And , God willing , it 's only a mile , you 'll get there safe , find a vehicle . Thank you . They 're building a wall to keep the triffids out . Torrence 's idea . But they all fight for Major Coker . Torrence gives the orders . Torrence seems to have an awful lot on his plate at the moment . I mean , why isn 't Osman helping ? I haven 't seen that little creep in a while . He got what he deserved . We found bits of him up on the Heath after the triffid attack . Never nothing of the other two . Nothing ? Coker was all right . Didn 't know the other bloke though . So they really found nothing of the other two ? Just what Torrence has got in that red box . Some bust-up old MP3 player . Troy , is Bill Masen alive ? Is he ? I don 't know , but Torrence thinks he might be . Come on ! Come on ! Move it ! Time for your broadcast , miss . OK . Thanks . Let 's go . # He leadeth me # The quiet waters by . Join me in giving thanks and praise to Peggy , who has been chosen ... like Father Thomas and the others , to go out and build new communities . Dr. Masen , please ... welcome , be seated . I know all about your new communities . I found Father Thomas 's body in the woods . Tied . Sacrificed . Dr. Masen , do you know anything about beekeeping ? The beehive is a symbol of the perfect harmonious society . Each bee has its appropriate place , its own task . And when the task is done , the bee is replaced , quickly and efficiently . The hive acts as one , always for the good of the hive . Not for the good of the queen ? Father Thomas was old . He could do nothing more for our little community . We cannot accommodate everyone who finds their way to our door . We have to prioritise . We have to make room . By feeding the surplus to the triffids ? The triffids are also God 's creatures . I did what God wanted me to do . What he told me to do . Outside these walls is chaos . Here , everything is customary , ceremonial , safe . As long as you do exactly as she says . As long as you abandon the weak and the helpless ! Believe me , everyone of you here will die before she does . I control the triffids . Without me , you 'll all be overrun . No one has the right to choose who lives and who dies . Stop them ! Let him go . Let him go . You ... These people trusted you and you betrayed them . If you defy me , you will be damned ! 3 , 2 , 1 ... Hello , again , whoever you are , wherever you are . I hope you can hear me . You can always stay . Work with us , as an equal . You think it 's going to be easy without me . I don 't think they want it to be easy . They want it to be right . The triffids know me . This community will not survive . I was thinking today about missed opportunities . We 're taking over London ! Did you ever know the right thing to do and then you hesitated ? And then it was too late . And do you long for that chance again ? Except yearning won 't make it happen . To keep you company so you know Jo is safe and well . Sometimes you have to act . Sometimes you have to make that chance happen again . This is Jo Playton , Radio Britain . Miss ? Now , you take care . Come back soon , yeah ? Yeah . Thank you . I heard your latest broadcast . Who were you talking to ? My father . But he 's dead , isn 't he ? Not to me , he isn 't . For a minute there , I thought you were talking to me . I was thinking about my dad , and how I missed the opportunity to be with him . How I don 't want to make the same mistake with you . What are you trying to tell me , Jo ? That I 've changed my mind . I want to have dinner with you . You 're just saying that cos ' you 're scared . Well , I am scared , but I know that you 'll protect me . Better than anyone . Better than Major Coker . I know he 's supposed to be running the country , but as far as I can see , you 're doing it all for him . And I have been ever since he died . Triffid attack . Why didn 't you tell me ? I didn 't want to give you any more bad news . You see , I 've been protecting you longer than you know . So you 're the one that 's in charge now . It 's a new world , Jo , yeah ? We can be anything we want , can do anything we want . Look at us . Look where we are . So , dinner ? Yes . When ? Tonight . After my broadcast . I forced myself on . The pollination of the triffids was inevitable . Once they spored , any hope of defeating them would be lost . Time was my greatest enemy . Calling all citizens - sighted and blind , man , woman and child , this is the voice of Britain . Come to London and lay your burdens down . Here there is safety , food and shelter . Here there is control . Here there is government , law and order . Yes , it might be delivered by the gun or the boot , but you won 't get into trouble . As long as you 're prepared to fight . As long as you 're prepared to die . Because that 's what you 're going to have to do : be prepared to fight and die , so that this so-called government can live in luxury and pretend that it is not losing the war ... Jo , what are you doing ? You 'll get us into trouble . ... the triffids are here , too . If you 've survived this far , don 't come to the centre . Don 't listen to me . The voice of Britain is a lie . I am Jo Playton , but I am not the voice of Britain . The voice of Britain is you , wherever you are . What is going on ? I told her , but she won 't stop talkin ' ... If you 've survived this far , don 't come to the center , don 't listen to me ... I told you to watch her . I ... I saw her start . She was here . But she 's not here now . Find her ! Troy ! Troy ! Move it ! The gate ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Get in and check behind all the seats ! You , up here with me ! Any sign of her ? Just triffids . There 's no way I 'm going out there . See anything ? She doesn 't stand a chance . Come on . Let 's go check the rest of them out . Come on , boys ! Good luck . Start . Please start . Please . Don 't shoot ! What do you want ? Don 't come any closer . I 'm not going to hurt you . But they will . Who ? Triffids . They 'll know you 're here . Yeah , I know triffids . I was stung . Everyone who gets stung dies . Not everyone . Come on , Susan . He 's OK . I 'm Bill ... Masen . Who are you ? My name 's Imogen . She 's my sister , Susan . Where are your parents ? We don 't want to talk about it . I 'm going to this house that I know , which I hope will be safe . But , listen , I need a car . Have you any idea where I can get one ? If we help you , you help us . Yeah . Fine . Thanks . I can 't see the name . Shirning ? Well , I think it 's in a very secluded spot . It 's probably not even marked . " Probably " ? I haven 't actually been there myself . Who lives there , then ? My father . Stay in the car . Stay in the car . Put it down . Dennis . Hello , son . There ... Shirning . So ... you 're here because of the triffids . Aye . And no doubt you want my research , so you can try and stop them . Come back from there ! Be very , very careful . Is he really your father ? Yeah . He 's scary . I heard that . Calling woman and child . This is the voice of Britain . Come to London and lay your burdens down . Here there is safety , food and shelter ... Nothing personal , Jo , but you do go on . 2 children , Bill . My , you are a dark horse . Sorry , this is Susan . And Imogen . I met them on the way here . They agreed to keep me company . And to look after him . Thank you for bringing him home . I was ... Well , I thought that you were ... Come along , girls . It is so good to see you . And these belong to you . My triffid recordings . How did you get this ? From Torrence . How did those girls survive ? Maybe they were too small and the triffids had easier prey . I don 't know . I promised to look after them . Just them ? # Dreamin' Oh-oh , just dreamin # Like to ramble on the road that never ends # Me and mother nature are the best of friends # Don 't think that I 'm lazy # I 'm just dreamin # Dreamin ' ... just dreamin ' ... What do you want ? It 's not good news , sir . The latest triffid reports from the front . Go ... away . So ? So , this is what you do with your retirement . Keep busy . When you devote your life to studying triffids , they tend to take over . But it does have its compensations . Here is how we stop the triffids . Create an entirely new triffid ? One which would generate pollen that sterilises rather than fertilises . We extract pollen from the male specimen , modify it , fertilise the young female triffid with it . She produces spores with the infertile strain . Simple . Elegant . With the same genetic fix that got us in this mess in the first place ? There are always unintended consequences , Bill , to everything we do . Sooner or later someone has got to deal with them and make sense of what happened . You remind me of your mother . She was the genuine article , the real thing . A brilliant scientist , interested only in knowledge for its own sake . Me ? My motivation was a wee bit more practical . I 've had this same picture with me for as long as I can remember . When that picture was taken , the future looked very bright for all 3 of us - the world even . Yeah ? I mean look at it . Mother Nature is finally taking her revenge and reclaiming the planet . No-one intended this , Bill . And now , given the consequences and the price that we both paid ... do you think it was it worth it ? Do you ? I can understand why you feel so angry . Angry ? I was a wee boy , my mum had just died and my dad ... My dad , he just didn 't seem to notice me . Too busy saving the world . No , no . No , you 're right . I never made time for you . I didn 't know how . Well , you were so young and I did try , but ... Without your mum ... These triffids are going to start sporing any day now . How far have you got with your plans ? I 've got everything we need . Except a male . I 've been hunting for one in and out of the old triffid facility , but as of yet , no luck . I 'll get you a male triffid . Good shooting . Reload . I need the practice . You don 't need your mask . Yes , I do . And you should , too . Mum and Dad don 't . They 're not Mum and Dad . They 're Jo and Bill . Well , they 're Mum and Dad to me . So that 's his plan and you 're going along with it ? We have to try something , before it 's too late . Great . We spent our lives trying to avoid the triffids , then end up back in a place that 's going to grow them . Did you consider me and the girls when you thought to go out and sacrifice yourself ? If you 've got a better idea , I 'd like to hear it . I suppose Dennis could could go , but last time he went out looking for a male triffid , he came back with you . I will come back . I promise . The clutch sticks a bit . Don 't go over 50 . And I would like it back exactly as it is . Susan ? I didn 't agree with my father 's plan , but I wasn 't doing it for him . I was doing it for Jo and the girls and for the rest of the world . You 've just got to understand ... Hello ? Come . Whoa . That smells terrible . Well , she needs to build her strength up , if she 's going to save mankind . Susan ! What are you doing here ? I 'm here to help . Don 't worry . I can take care of myself . Yeah , I 've noticed . Susan ! Bill ! Bill ! Help ! Help ! No ! You OK ? You got it . We got it . Here , come . Well ? Did you get it ? One male triffid head . You 're in a lot of trouble with Mum . No ! Just don 't do it again . You did well , son . How did you do it ? With this . It 's got triffid sounds from the farm on it . I have a theory that different sounds provoke different emotions . And the proof ? I tried to identify the obvious emotions like fear and hunger , but they 're so complex and I 've barely scratched the surface . Your mother was of the same opinion . Her biggest fear was that we 'd exploit the triffids without understanding them . I couldn 't persuade her to leave Zaire . It was more than just oil for her . She recognized some indications of sensibility . They could communicate with each other . She was convinced that if we didn 't understand them thoroughly ... we might live to regret it . She wouldn 't let go . She just kept pushing and pushing , and in the end ... she got too close . I miss her , too . Yeah . You know , I ... I always ... wanted to give you these . I never had the opportunity ... or the words . From Zaire . Your mother 's recordings of triffids . Thanks . You know what ? Once we 've fertilized the female maybe we can work on them together . Right . Maybe together we could crack it . It 's happening . The triffids are sporing . You knew this was going to happen ? Not like this . Nothing like this . What did you find ? Got that from one of the farms . Good boy , Troy . That 'll be all . Jo ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! What 's it say ? There 's people on the Isle of Wight . There 's more than 200 of them . And they want people to join them . They 've got families , doctors , schools . Where there 's life , there 's hope . At least we have somewhere safe to go once we release the new breed of triffids . Speaking of which , feeding time . I 'll be up in a minute . This is good . This is very good ! This is very good ! Patience , little one . Patience . This is Dr. Ruth Masen . It 's the 16th of September , 11am . We 're one mile outside base camp by the Kasai River basin . This is triffid recording number 0050 . Bill ! Bill ! BILL ! Bill ! Bill ! Bill ! Bill ! Bill ! The tape ! The tape ! Turn off the tape ! Dad ? ! Get the tape ! No ! No ! Don 't kill it ! Don 't ... ! No ! I 'm sorry , Bill . No ... ! Sorry , Bill . No ! No ! Your mother was ... your mother , she was right . No . I 'm so sorry , Bill . Stay still . Don 't talk . That recording 's from a triffid in Africa . It wasn 't genetically modified . So that could be the reason that the one your dad grew reacted to the sound . Perhaps it thought it was under attack . I don 't know . Can you start again ? No time . There 's never enough time ! We can stay here a little longer ... if you want to . There 's nothing here for us now . We 'll leave for the Isle of Wight first thing in the morning . Hello ? Hello again . Whoever you are , wherever you are , I hope you can hear me . I was thinking today about missed opportunities ... Bill . What is that ? What ? Something 's wrong . The radio 's on . Come on . .. maybe out of fear . Do you long for that chance again ? Except yearning won 't make it ha ... Imogen , where 's Susan ? What 's wrong ? Nothing 's wrong . Hello , Jo ... If you hurt her ... ! No ! Cute child . Get away from her . As you can see , I 've come with friends . Where 's Susan ? Where is she ? Susan ? All tied up . She wouldn 't co-operate . I want you to take her , put her with the sister and watch her . Well , good to see you , too , Jo ! Triffids too much for you , were they , Torrence ? We had terrible trouble with the triffids . They started using the underground tunnels and sewers . Not very sporting . But now , now you 're going to help us , Bill . Good job you didn 't die . So what do we do , eh ? How do we stop the triffids ? I don 't know . Well , that is very disappointing ! Cos I was relying on you . I said to Troy there , " Troy , you know who we need to help us with the triffids ? " It 's Dr. Bill Masen . " You 'd better put your thinking cap on . It 's too late . They 've already spored . We either fight them or we give up . Or we could go to the Isle of Wight . I found a message from Major Coker . Why would you want to go to the Isle of Wight ? You need the triffids . Do I , Jo ? Yes , you do , because they made you . I mean , without them , you 're nothing . You 're nothing but a jumped-up little ... You shut ... ! Don 't touch her ! Don 't you touch her ! OK , finger off the trigger . Stay of execution . You 've got until tomorrow morning to come up with something ! Something to get us all safely out of here and down to the coast ! You do that , that 'll be great . If you fail , I take Jo , kill you , I give the girls to the triffids . Is it a plan ? OK . OK . Yeah . Excellent . OK . Lock them up . CCTV and controls for the electric gates if the triffids attack . The old man really had this place triffid-proof ? Bring Masen to me . The solution to the triffids is in my mother 's recordings . It has to be . If we can ... use the sounds to communicate with them ... somehow , then maybe we can control them . But we 've only got until tomorrow morning . And the noise of those men will bring the triffids . Yeah , well , we have to escape . We 've done it before and we will do it again . Torrence is not going to make the same mistake twice . Jo , we have a much better chance against the triffids than we do against Torrence . Triffids . What , Bill ? The triffids could be the answer . How ? We use my triffids recordings . We draw them in en masse as a distraction so we can get out . Bill , it 's a brilliant idea , but how are we going to get out surrounded by hundreds of triffids ? They 'll kill us all ! It 'll be all right . It 'll cause confusion , and maybe , maybe it 'll give us a chance to escape . Mr. Torrence wants to see you . OK . It 's all right . I was upstairs in the laboratory . Looks like you had a bit of a problem . Dad not make it ? Is this your mum ? She 's foxy . How 's your plan getting on ? You 'll let me know when you come up with a solution ? You 've got till dawn . Otherwise I reunite you with Mummy and Daddy . It 's OK . Where 's the device ? I did it . I put it outside . Triffids . Triffids ! Triffids ! ... triffids . They 're everywhere ! Found this . Hold that . Bill , what have you gone and done ? Troy , shoot Masen . No ! Damn . Shoot the girls . Go now . And be ready to put the electric fence on full power . My command . They 're everywhere . I 've got orders to shoot the girls . Troy , this isn 't you . Stop it . There 's no way that Torrence can get past the triffids . We 're leaving . Come with us . Fire now ! Are you done ? Yeah , I 'm done . Troy ? 'Is everything OK ? ' Sir . OK . Just wait here . I 've got to get something . Stand by on the electric fence . On my mark . 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Now . Switching on now , sir . Switch it on now ! No ! No ! Switch on the electric fence NOW ! It 's not working . Troy ... ! Hold the line ! Troy , you get on this radio and ... Ashdown , Ashdown , pull back to the house . Look after this for me , will you ? OK . Come on . Come on , quick . C 'mon . There he is , the traitor . Torr ... Anyone remember this ? Look ... Young love . Very sweet . You 're leaving without me . That 's not very nice . We 're making a run for it , Torrence . I mean , look , they 're everywhere . I know . They 're gonna ' kill us all . Except you . I 'm going to kill you . Why don 't you come with us ? What , me ? But I 'm just a " jumped-up nobody " . Torrence , come on . If anyone can get us through an army of triffids , Torrence , it 's y- - Aww . Nice try , Jo , you ... Come on ! Come on ! Get the door ! Get the door ! Go ! Go ! Go ! We 're never gonna ' make it ! There are too many of them ! We have to try ! No , Bill ! They 're already in the courtyard ! OK , does everyone have goggles ? Does everyone have goggles ? Yeah . Everyone ? Jo , take these . No , you take them . Take them , Jo ! What about you , Bill ? Wear this . The mask ... Hang on . Bill ! Wait , wait , wait , wait ! They 'll kill us ! Wait ! Let me think ! It 's the mask . The mask . The mask . Wear this ... and see ! And see . And see ! What 's going on ? You must wear this ... OK . It was Imogen . She helped me to remember . It was the night that my mother died . I remember . I know how we can get through this . Sit there . Trust me ! Do you trust me ? You have to trust me . Bill , what are you talking about ? ! You must wear this . This is triffid poison . No ! No ! It will save her ! No way . You can 't ! You 'll kill her ! It will save her . It will save us all . Please , trust me . You have to trust me . Please . Please . OK . OK . It 's all right , sweetheart . They are coming , the triffids . It 's all right , darling . It 's all right . Stay still . Stay still . Stay still . It 's OK . It 's OK , Imogen . Imogen , it 's OK . Trust me . Stay still . Stay still . Trust me ! We must all do this . The pain will pass . Good girl . The triffids , they are coming . Trust . Everybody walk slow and steady . Don 't be frightened . OK ? Susan . Susan , come on . Masen ! Go ! Run ! Come on ! Run ! Go ! Go ! Bill ! Masen ! Come on ! Masen ... Here we go . No ! Masen ! Get off ! Don 't you dare ! So we left for our new home , where we found other families , other friends . The sea was our wall against the triffids . We cleaned the isle of them and our community started to grow again . Future generations will ask how it happened . How did the world get swallowed up so quickly ? It was because we had our eyes closed . Even when we could see .

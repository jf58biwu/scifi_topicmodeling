Mostly i meet with various business And government people ... - ? - ? And consult . Honey , do you have to do that at the table ? Sorry . ? So i have yet to hear Word one about your trip . Claire ? Nothing much to tell . You visited five Of the best colleges on the east coast And you have nothing to tell ? Which ones did you like , noah ? Brown . I liked brown . Claire ? Come back here .

Your new job ! Our father / daughter college tour . We can 't risk her knowing anything right now . The last time she knew , she almost got herself killed . Your mom and lyle are safer this way . Dad , you 've been telling me that since i was 15 . They 're not just watching you , claire . They 're watching me . You brought a plane down out of the sky , Federal agents are dead , And a lot of people want to see you pay . If either one of us strays from the script , I won 't be able to stop them . There won 't be any paper trail . No trial . One day , you 'll just be gone And nobody can find you . And now 's the part where you tell me How everything you do , you do to protect me . No . Now 's the part when i tell you Exactly what you 're going to do next : Start classes at costa verde community . You 're already enrolled . History , english lit , Spanish . And come monday morning , You better be parked in that front row With a sharp number two pencil Or there is going to be hell to pay . ? ? Wires are up . Accounts are frozen . We have traffic cam feeds From all 50 states . Patriot act gives us a lot of leeway here . What 's our status on the bennet girl ? Eyes only . We look , but we don 't touch . Senator petrelli Has granted ms . Bennet a probation for now . Should the terms of that arrangement be compromised , I will certainly bring it to his attention . Assuming he finishes his latte and decides to show up for work . Double espresso . And claire bennet is still off-Limits . Now i know a lot of you lost friends On this crash . You want payback . I understand that . Not all of these individuals Out there are dangerous . Some of them are just plain scared . Now that they know they 're being pursued , They 're gonna be even that much harder to catch . Which is why i put in a request To the white house this morning to double our funding .

She lives in des moines . They had a kid that was born with some sort of ... Bone dis- - Stop . I can tell when people are lying Because i saw open their skulls And rip their abilities out From their brains . So you 're like a serial killer . I 'm not a serial killer . But you 've got a pattern . You go after specific victims . You collect mementos . Okay , technically , i 'm a serial killer . Now that we 've established that , Give me one good reason Why i shouldn 't tear open your head right here . Because you 'll never find your dad . It 's not a road trip . Do you understand ? Sir ! Are you alex ? You 're a girl . Yeah , i am . No , it 's just we don 't normally get a lot of girls in here . You know ? Listen , i 'm just here to deliver a message . You 're in danger .

 Heroes Season 02 Episode 01 the sun rises on a new dawn . Yet few of us realize the debt we owe to those responsiblefor this . To those who dwell among us , anonymous , seemingly ordinary , whom destiny brought together to repair , to heal , to save us from ourselves . If evolution can do this for even the smallest of creatures , then why not these human beings ? If someone here ... found out about me , what would happen ? When will they stop ? I don 't know . she 's a shiny new toy , and she 's all mine . and they 're still out there , among us , in the shadows , in the light . We pass them on the street without a glance , never suspecting , never knowing . Do they even know yet ? That they are bound together by a common purpose , a glaring reality , to be extraordinary ? Teleportation , tissue generation ; these are no longer simply theories . I have seen them with my own eyes . And when destiny does anoint them ... my name is hiro nakamura . I 'm from the future . How do they hide from it ? You may feel confined here , but this is far freer a cage than the one they 'd put you in . how long can they dwell in the shadows before either fate or their own flawed humanity draws them out into the light again ? And how will they know what awaits them when it finally does ? chapter one " four months later ... " And not only are these special individuals among us , they bear a curse . MOHINDER SURESH CAIRO , EGYPT A virus which strips them of their powers and leads to their eventual death . In the last few months , I have discoveredwhat I believe to be a plague . A plague which targetsonly these unique individuals . It 's a disease which threatens to eradicate them all . And in doing so , deprives our species of its evolutionary advancement . Without this advancement , the challenges of the modern world : Global warming , terrorism , diminishing resources , seem almost insurmountable on our thin shoulders . The fate of humanity itself hangs in the balance . But with proper funding and research , we can stop the advancement of this disease . I urge each and every one of you to take up this cause , spread the word , and fight those who would keep the world from the truth . Thank you all for coming . Inspirational lecture , dr . Suresh .

Paper business is dog eat dog . You gotta live it and breathe it . You gotta want it . Do you want it , butler ? Do you ? Yes , sir . Yeah . Well , we 'll see . The company was formed 30 years ago with a group of like-minded individuals , ordinary men and women who were gifted with extraordinary powers . They wanted to help their own . To find them and to protect them . We find people , and we make sure they don 't become dangerous . Now sometimes that can mean making sure they understand entirely what they 're capable of . And teaching them to use their abilities for the good of mankind . And sometimes it can mean eliminating them . Who the hell are you to judge who lives and who dies ? If I 'm not mistaken , you yourself tried to put a bullet in the brain of a man named sylar . He was a monster . Yes . And you were willing to kill him for the greater good . You acted on a moral imperative to protect your species . It doesn 't matter one way or the other about sylar . He 's no longer a threat . He 's dead . And now you have molly . You and matt parkman are protecting her . Now we 're not interfering with that arrangement . Far from it . We 're offering to help you . We have resources to offer you , dr . Suresh . The plague .

Does that mean you passed your detective 's exam ? With flying colors . Why ? You proud of me ? Mm , depends . Did you cheat ? Why would you ask me that ? Reading the answers out of people 's minds , it 's unfair . No , it is my natural talent .

So I came over on one of the few trade vessels your emperor let pass . The boat left full of tea , I kept on to find my fortune . You should see what I got paid to fend off those bandits . Kensei takezo does not fight for money . He fights for honor . Really ? Well , as long as it 's honor I can spend . It 's not a bad lot . I mean , I find a stout brute , put him on a horse , put him in a field , and tell him to shout on about how he 's fearsome old kensei . Then I repair to the branch of a tree and start to pick off the black guards one by one . That 's fighting dirty ! That 's fighting smart , sir . What ? I give him a fair wage . If he lives . No .

And you took the swordsmith 's daughter , the most beautiful woman in all japan for your princess . We gave you everything we had to defend us . Now our homes are burned . Those bandits took my father hostage . And you sit here drinking ? No need for everyone 's day to be ruined . You swore to challenge them in battle . I did , Yaeko .

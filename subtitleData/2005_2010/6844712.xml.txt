 My name is detective Brett Hopper , and this is the day that changes everything . Freeze ! Put your hands up ! You 're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza . I will be framed for murder ... Who the hell are you people ? My girlfriend Rita will be in danger . I know all this because I am living the same day ... over and over again . The day is the same , but different things happen . Every decision I make has a consequence . I could save a stranger 's life ... or not . I didn 't go for coffee . I could try to run ... or hide . But the next morning , I feel the pain of the day before . Every day I get another chance . This mess you 're in ... have anything to do with the fact you been looking into the latin disciples ? We flipped this kid Damien Ortiz against the disciples , now he 's on the run . Every day , I get another clue . Hopper , you should have received a package today . It 's important . Today , I have to get that package . - Good morning . - Morning . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . What are you doing ? - Just a sec . - Brett . I 'm just gonna take a shower . Me , too . I 'll scrub your back . Sounds great , baby . Will you just let me in ? Come on . Come on . Come on . Open up . What ? I thought we were gonna take a shower together . I was ... we were , but I was thinking maybe I would take the day off today . Really ? You never take the day off . Yeah , well , I thought maybe we could hang out . - Baby , I gotta work . - Well , you could take the day off , too . I can 't do that . Come on , come on . It 'll be fun . Come ... Oh , no . I 'm sorry . - It 's okay . - No . It 's not okay . I know that your mother gave this to you . Okay . I 'm gonna make this up to you . I promise . We can go anywhere you want to go today . Anywere . Okay . Okay ? Okay . Okay , cool . I 'm just gonna drop by my place and pick up a package , and we 'll be good . Cool . Let 's go . - You said anywhere , right ? - Huh ? Oh , yep . Yep . Okay . Mexico . Mex ... what ? Let 's go down to Rosarito Beach . I know this great lobster shack right off the highway . Six beers for a buck . Okay . Sure . Sounds great . Miss ... you dropped this . You want some coffee ? Yeah . This will be the most incredible by far ... Excuse me , ma 'am . L.A.P.D. - Hold on . What 's the problem ? - Can I see some I.D. , please ? - What for ? - Just a police investigation . We 're questioning potential witnesses . I didn 't see anything . And I have a morning meeting that 's ... I 'm sure he 'll understand . Can I please see your identification ? Hello ? Wait . Just calm down . What 's wrong ? Look , I can 't . Not today . Not now . Just ... please just stop calling me . I just ... I can 't . I 'm sorry . I just ... I can 't . Okay . And this judge Nitzberg ... he 's your supervisor . Look , I 've given you my address , my cell phone . I mean , what more do you want ? Thank you . That 'll be all , ma 'am . My car ! My car ! - Where you going ? - In the bus . I 'm gonna go help 'em . - Rita ... - Call 9-1-1 , okay ? W ait . We had plans . I 'm sorry . We 're just gonna have to play hooky another day . Okay , but wait . We don 't have to cancel . The E. M. T. S are gonna come . They 'll take over . Brett , what is going on ? - Nothing . - Nothing ? Nothing ? First you take the day off , then you don 't want me to go to work . Now you want me to leave a major accident scene ? You are acting really strange . What has gotten into you ? They played me some voice mail . A woman talking about some package they sent to you . They think it has something to do with Garza . I 'm gonna go help those people , and then I 'm going to the hospital . Okay , but stay there . Don 't leave . Okay ? I 'm gonna meet you after I go to my place . Don 't leave the hospital ! - Mr. Hopper . - Mr. Zeitoun . - I need to speak to you . - I know , I know . The dog 's been barking . There 's a leak upstairs . A plumber came , right ? Yes . That 's ... yes . Sorry for the inconvenience . What is this , a joke ? You think this is funny ? - Is he talking to us ? - Nah . No way he made us . Is this what you want ? Huh ? Come and get it ! - No , he 's definitely talking to us . - Yup . Let 's start two large-bore I. V. S , normal saline , wide open . And I want you to page Dr. Kim . I think she might have tension pneumo . Rita , you 've got a visitor . Chad . - You changed your hair . - Six months ago . It looks nice . Although I liked it when you had that layered thing . Chad , I 'm working . What are you doing here ? Can 't a guy stop by check on his ex-wife ? No . Well , then I 'll cut right to it . You seen Hopper lately ? How 's that any of your business ? It became my business when your boyfriend murdered Alberto Garza . What are you talking about ? Assistant D.A. got hit last night . Hopper 's the prime suspect . There 's a warrant out for his arrest . There must be some mistake . Yeah , kind of hard to believe . You think you know someone , and then they go and do something crazy . Brett didn 't kill anyone . I hear different . Sorry to be the one to tell you , but Hopper 's in real trouble . There are a couple guys downtown wanna talk to you about it . Look , you don 't have to go , but it might be helpful ... for Hopper 's sake . Hi , Hopper . I know this is a reach for you , but don 't do anything stupid . - Rita , we need to leave . - Brett ... Yeah , that 's a good plan . She 's gonna go on the run with a fugitive . You gotta come with me , all right ? It 's the only way I can protect you . The only one she needs protection from is you , buddy . Sweetheart , call 9-1-1 . I got a guy here with a gun in my back . Whatever he 's saying , I didn 't do it . I didn 't kill Garza . You gotta believe me . Brett , just put the gun down . Better listen to her , Hopper . Hole 's getting deeper . Shut up ! Honey , listen , I know this looks crazy . I know I don 't have the right to ask you this , but I am . You gotta come with me . I 'll explain everything later . Just please come with me . Brett ... That was real sweet , but you 're under arrest . I 'm gonna have to take you in . Not today . - Whiskey sour . - You got it . A little early for that , don 't you think ? - Hopper , what are you doing here ? - I 'm here looking for you . - They say you killed ... - Garza . Yeah , I know . I also know that they offered you a deal to flip on me in exchange for amnesty on your I.A. investigation . I never agreed to ... - How the hell did you know that ? - Just hear me out , all right ? That 's all I 'm asking . Message eight ... Hopper , you should have received a package today . It 's important . Don 't let anyone know you have it . You 'll be contacted ... No . Homicide already played me that . Who , the hardy boys ? They 're pretty hot and heavy on that package . They think it 's tied to Garza . Yeah , well , so do I. - And this is what was inside ? - Yeah . Why would someone send you a busted up hourglass ? I don 't know . But that 's why I need you to run a trace on my home phone . Incoming calls for the last 12 hours . If I can find the woman who left that message , maybe I can get some answers . How do you know I won 't just turn this into them , make all my problems go away ? Hopper ! I don 't know . I just got a feeling . Shelton , heard you had Hopper but you let him go . But you brought his girlfriend in , right ? Yeah , where is she ? She 's busy . She 'll come in on her own time . Busy ? I thought you said you had an in with her . Guess not . - Give the guy a break . It 's his wife . - Ex-wife . Right , that 's gotta suck . Keep laughing . You two are heading into a wall . Yeah ? How 's that ? You 'll never get Andrea Battle to flip on Hopper . Really ? Well , who do you think she 'd rather deal with , I.A. or us ? Message on your answering machine came from a blocked number . - What kind of a block ? - Law enforcement . - Did you bypass it ? - Gimme some credit . The call came from the home of a U.S. Attorney , Nathan Baxter . - What happened at the safe house ? - Focus , Baxter . Is he a friend of yours ? What 's going on , Hopper ? That U.S. Attorney 's putting together a case against the latin disciples . Yeah , I heard about the rumors . What 's that got to do with you ? Baxter contacted me about an L.D. informant I 'm running , Damien Ortiz . I got him to flip against the disciples , had him all holed up in a safe house , but something happened and the whole thing went south . Turned me against my own only so you could sell my ass out ? I didn 't sell you out . And what , you thought you 'd just tell me about it at trial ? No . I know I shouldn 't have kept you in the dark . I know it was a mistake . Yeah , damn right , it was a mistake . Anything else you 're not telling me , partner ? Yeah , but you wouldn 't believe me . You got an address on Baxter ? I got blood . Yeah , I do , too . - You know her ? - No . But I think she 's the woman who called me about the package . The killer shot her once in the back . She was running away . Yeah , if I can get here earlier tomorrow , I might be able to help her , - maybe get some information . - What the hell are you talking about ? Something 's happening today , something big , and I 'm at the center of it . I don 't know how . I don 't know why . I don 't know who 's pulling the strings . But somehow all of this is tied together . Damien , Baxter , Garza and now this dead woman . - You think this is a conspiracy ? - Yes , and I 'm the fall guy . Two years we 've been together , right ? Two years ? I 've never even had a boyfriend last that long . We used to finish each other 's sentences . Now you 're running investigations behind my back , talking about some conspiracy against you . I mean , - I wanna believe you ... - You don 't believe me , do you ? You lied to me . I 'll give you a half-hour before I call this in . All right . Hey , hopper ? Who else you been lying to ? I already told you , I 'm not going to the station . And I 'm not talking to anyone about Brett , least of all you , Chad . Yeah , I got that loud and clear . I 'm not here on police business . - Then why are you here ? - Well , it 's must 've been a rough day . I thought you might need a ride home . You 're kidding , right ? Yeah , forget it . Bad idea . I 'll call you a cab . Just wanted to make sure you 're okay . Are you ... okay ? Just let me take you home . Well , thank you . Yeah , no problem . Chad , don 't . I 'm not gonna try anything . I thought you might want me to check your place . Why ? I 'm worried about you , what , with Hopper out there somewhere . No , I 'm just saying , he 's armed and dangerous ... - Brett would never hurt me . - Not on purpose . Things can go sideways . I mean , I 've seen it . A couple years ago , cops were serving a warrant on this cripple in Tarzana , - the guy pulls a gun ... - And they shot him . Turns out they had the wrong address , right ? You forget , I know all your stories . - Yeah , I guess you do . - Yeah , I do . Well , look , if you want , I can stay over . on the couch , of course . Thank you for the ride , Chad . Let 's just leave it at that . Shelton . Oh , hey , Buck . Yeah , I think I can still make that . Where 'd you say that bar was ? It 's the place on Los Feliz . I 'll see you there . - What happened to your shoulder ? - I 'm okay . I 'm okay . - You 're bleeding . Let me see . - Rita , I 'm fine . I just came by to make sure that you got here safely . Chad drove me home . Chad ? Yeah , he was worried that maybe you 'd gone off the deep end or something . Listen , I promise I will tell you everything . I just ... I don 't have the time right now , all right ? Then you 're gonna make time . I have been worried sick , and Chad says you 've been accused of murder ? Since when do you start believing everything Chad says ? When you put a gun on him . You came to the hospital , a place where I work , and brought a gun . And now you don 't wanna talk about it ? You won 't understand . God , I want to understand ! But you are scaring me , Brett . I just want to know what happened to the man I went to bed with last night . Look , I know that I should not have come here tonight . And I 'm sorry , but I just ... I wanted to make sure that you ... you were all right . I 'm not all right . Please ... please just go . Please . Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! If you think that first step 's a bitch , wait till the next one . Damien ... Hell no . Fellas , look , I know I forgot to call Damien . I know that . You know , I missed my 9 : 00 . I realize that . I just ... I 've been , like ... like , crazy , crazy busy . You get that , right ? So we cool ? Damien ... I can explain . - I can explain . - Too bad . The time for explaining 's over . I thought we had a deal . I help you , you help me . - Win-win for everyone , right ? - Yes , - and you did ... - I put myself out there for you ! - You did the right thing ! - You think so ? You wanna know what happened to the last dude in my hood who snitched on a rival banger ? Let me guess . He got taken to an abandoned parking structure ? Nah , man , he got territory . Got rid of the competition , scored 12 blocks all his own , upped his production by 150 % . The dude was making five figures a week . He got treated right . Me ? I let you talk me into ratting out my boys , let you stick me in some safe house , and then - I almost get my ass shot off . - Damien , you gotta believe me I wanna believe you , Hopper , I really do . Only I can 't find you . You don 't return my calls . And when I reach out to you , you blow me off . I 'm sorry . I 've been a little busy . - You 've been busy ? - Yes . The city 's about to go up in flames , Hop . There are deals being cut right now that I 'm not ... What are you talking about , deals ? What deals ? You have no idea how big this is , do you ? Well , tell me . You haven 't earned that . See , on the street , all you got is your word . There 's no contracts , no lawyers . You break your word , there 's a price to pay ... simple . what 's in the back ? That ? You remember Baxter , right ? You two chotas were the only ones who knew about that safe house . So one of you is gonna die tonight . - You 're making a big mistake . - You made the mistake ! Somebody gave you up at the safe house , but it wasn 't Baxter , it wasn 't me , all right ? We 've been set up , man . - Set up ? - Yes . - By who ? - I don 't know , but I 'm a figure that out . I just need a little bit more time . Just a little bit more time , Damien . Can you do that ? I 'm-a find out who 's behind this . You got my word on that . You know what , Hop ? I believe you . We 're done . I see you again , and you 're dead , too . Hey , you 're up early . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . What 's wrong ? Are you mad at me ? Nice grab . Yeah , I was just I was just lucky . Look , I 'm sorry . I just got a ... I got a lot going on right now . You want to talk about it ? No . No . Yeah , yeah , I do actually ... I have this ... this case , and there 's a witness and the witness has a ... a hit out on her . And I need to protect her . But if I do , then I won 't have time for the case . - Don 't you have help ? - No , it 's complicated . So if you don 't protect her , will she get hurt ? I don 't know . Well , I think it 's obvious . The only way to protect her is to get to the bottom of it , right ? Solve the case wouldn 't that make her safe ? I hope so . Solve the case . What was that for ? Just for being you . Oh ... if Chad calls , talk to him . Okay , and this judge Nitzberg ... This is Margo . Hey , uh , where the hell are you ? - Who 's this ? - The meeting got pushed up . - You 're late ! - I didn 't hear about this . No , Nitzberg is looking for you . He 's really upset . Oh , okay . Give me 20 minutes . You gotta get here right now . And don 't stop for coffee ! Okay , I 'll be right there . I said , don 't stop for coffee ! Yes , sir , will do . So ? So we wait . Was ... was he pissed about the guy in the tub ? What do you think ? You know what a one-bedroom runs in this neighborhood ? I don 't know , $ 1,200 ? That 's ludicrous . - What , are you moving here ? - No . So what do you care ? Morning , boys . Ah , don 't do that . - Can we help you with something ? - You can start by putting your hands where I can see 'em . Now ... why are you following me ? - We 're just sitting here . - And videotaping me ? - We 're tourists . - Yeah , know any good places to eat around here ? Now I know you 've been following my girlfriend and my sister . I know about the guy in the quarry . I wanna speak to him , right now . All right , listen , you got us , okay ? I 'm just gonna reach for my phone . - Yeah , it 's me again . - Hey , who the hell are you ? - Move , I got a shot ! - Don 't shoot ! - I can get him . Just move . - Don 't shoot ! I got him . Get out ! Come on , move away ! Drive ! The balls on that guy . Wanna go back ? No , we gotta call it in . Where 's your phone ? An assistant D.A. got hit last night . Hopper 's a prime suspect . There 's a warrant out for his arrest . There must be some mistake . Yeah , it 's kinda hard to believe . You think you know someone , - then they do something crazy like that . - Chad , Brett didn 't kill anyone . I hear it different . Sorry to be the one to tell you . Hopper 's in real trouble . There are a couple guys downtown wanna talk to you about it . Look , you don 't have to go , but it might be helpful ... for Hopper 's sake . Okay . Just let me get my bag . - Hopper , what are you doing here ? - Where is she ? - Where 's who ? - The girl , Baxter . What ... I don 't know what you 're talking about . 5 ' 7 " , dark hair , blue eyes , - legs that won 't quit . - How do you ... What ? Are you following me ? Hopper ! Hey , did you call me ? - Was it you ? - What ? You called and left me a message about this package . You said it was very important . - You 're Hopper ? - Yeah . He told me to call you . He said that you 'd understand . Who ? Who told you to call me ? Garza . Garza ? Did he send me this package ? Yeah . He 's here . Hopper ... he 's at my house right now . Come on . I don 't know how he found out , but he 's upstairs right now . Hello ? Hello ? Did you hear what I just said ? Hopper is here . Those guys for yours , They work for you ? - Who ? - The guys you were calling . - The ones who have been following me . - What ? No ... - those guys are squeezing me . - You 're gonna tell me everything . - They 'll kill me . - I 'll kill you ! Calmate . Calmate . Just answer their questions truthfully . They 're not after you . Remember , I got your back . I 'll be all right , Chad . You 're Jennifer , right , Brett 's sister ? - Yeah . - Rita , right ? Yeah . I just want you to know that everything 's gonna be okay . Brett was with me last night . With you ? But I thought ... so you two ... - It 's complicated . - Yeah . I 've been trying to get a number for your mom . Oh , that 's not a good idea . She and Brett don 't really talk anymore . Real tight family you got there , huh ? Listen , if I hear anything , I 'm gonna give you a call . I 'm sure he 's okay . Thank you . No . You gotta call Damien . You 're making a big mistake . - You 're making ... Call Damien ! - Help . Hey ! Where are they taking us ? What are they gonna do ? You don 't want to know . We gotta get outta here , Hopper . We gotta get out . Damien knows you sold him out . - What ? No , I would never do that . - Shut up . Don 't waste your breath . He knows . Now your only hope of getting out of here is me , so you better start talking . I never got their names . They came to me a couple of days ago . Two men said they wanted information about Damien . Why Damien ? - Why Damien ? ! - The latin disciples are getting into contract killings . Damien knows names . What does that have to do with Garza or me ? I have no idea . I swear . Damien was my informant , and you used me to get at him . I didn 't want to . They held a gun to my head . - Me or him ? I 'm gonna pick me . - I vouched for you , man . I guaranteed Damien his life . Hey , Damien knew exactly what he was getting into . In case you forgot , Hopper , Damien is the bad guy . I don 't care who he is . - I gave him my word . - Will you grow up , Hopper ? Damien 's a killer and a drug dealer . - He 's getting exactly what he deserves . - Oh , okay . Well , you 're gonna get exactly what you deserve . Because when we reach that parking structure , Damien 's gonna put a bullet in your head . So you 're telling us you were with Hopper last night ? Yes . And he never went out , maybe went for a walk ? I was with him all night . Well , I appreciate that , and I want to believe you , I really do . You know , when we ran your driver 's license , some interesting information came up . That 's not relevant . We were just wondering if Mr. Shelton could clarify a few things . I mean , this isn 't the first time that she 's been involved in a questionable incident . Not going there . Move along . Chad , if this is all too much for you , you can go . I go , she goes . Next question . Any idea where Hopper is now ? Who was she ? Who ? The girl . You seem pretty upset about her . Of course I 'm upset about her . I got my own problems to deal with right now . What was her name ? Ava . Her name was Ava Reese . I met her at the courthouse a couple of weeks ago . What 's her connection to Garza ? She worked for him . What the hell does it matter ... Thank God , it 's you guys . Sorry , Hopper . You took my phone . Thank you for the ride , Chad . And thank you for sticking up for me back there . Oh , hey , what 's in your background is your business , not theirs . Your secret 's safe with me . And yours with me . What secret is that ? That you 're not always such a hard-ass . Look , if you want , I could stay over ... on the couch , of course ... and keep an eye on things . Let me at least walk you up . If you feel okay , I 'll go . No , I don 't want to keep you . I 'm sure you have plans tonight . No , I 'm just gonna meet this guy in a bar . I can reschedule . Hello . - Hey , it 's me . - Oh , thank God . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Where are you ? It 's probably best I don 't say . They could be tapping your phone . They asked me a lot of questions . They said terrible things about you . None of it 's true . I 'm sorry they put you through all that . I just called to make sure you were safe . Rita ... everything okay ? I love you . I love you , too . When will I see you again ? Tomorrow . I 'll see you tomorrow . - Rita ? - Hopper , I need your help . I 've done something terrible .

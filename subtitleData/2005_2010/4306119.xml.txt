 Ten dead , 12 wounded . They shot the temple to shreds . Never dreamed we 'd get this lucky . Lucky ? The Cylons are cracking down , they 're making random arrests . One thousand people protested outside Colonial One today . Temple massacre pushed people over the edge . Population 's with us now . Solved our recruitment problem . More than 150 people joined up in the last three days . A hell of a bargain for a few confiscated weapons . What about the 10 innocent people ? Why don 't you tell Duck what a bargain you got for Nora 's life ? You got that ass-backwards , sonny , we didn 't shoot those people , the chrome jobs did . 'Cause we hid weapons there . Hey ! We 're not playing pattycake here . These bastards burned up 20 billion of us . You gonna say that 's our fault , too ? Instead of bawling like a little girl , you should focus on getting some payback . Is that all this is about to you ? Blood for blood ? We 're at war , war is messy . People get killed . Good people , nice people . Get that through your head or get out . We don 't need any crybabies in this outfit .

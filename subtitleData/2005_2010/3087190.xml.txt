You can move into your father 's old office , Mohinder . Thank you . [ door opens ] Mira . I wasn 't sure you 'd speak to me at the funeral . I didn 't want to take that chance , so I left .

But nothat he 's dead , I feel- - What 's done is done . Is it ? Your mother tells me you 're not returning to New York . New semester starts next week . My life is here . [ sighs ] I 've been promoted at the company . Head of all genetic research . Can you imagine ? Good for you . No , good for you . It 's the sort of cutting-edge science we used to talk about late into the night . The world 's worst pillow talk , I 'd say . I was hoping I could convince you to come in for an interview with the partners . Only I 'd have to know that your father 's work , all of his theories , would stay right where they are . Packed away in that box . I don 't expect an answer right now . But you will think about it , won 't you ? Yes . We didn 't say hello . Hello , Mira . Hello , Mohinder . ( Thayer ) I need you to handle this . I 'll give you one hour . You 're an idiot , Parkman , do you know that ? Wow , good morning to you , too . You think I wouldn 't find out about you assaulting a fellow officer ? I didn 't assault him . I- - I just hit him . This is why I don 't like needing people . Nine times out of ten , they let you down . Wow , that 's an optimistic view of the world . Just an observation . And how 'd this get to be about you ? Because it was a stupid rookie move , and you could 've jeopardized my investigation . How serious is this ? Are you getting suspended ? I 'll work it out . Did he deserve it ? Yeah . Yeah , he deserved it . [ door slams ] Is he talking ? Nope . And he 's got one hour before Homeland Security sends him down the rabbit as a suspected terrorist . Terrorist ? We both know he 's not a terrorist . His wife was dying . He lost control . Of what ? This guy puts out 1,800 curies of radiation without ever coming in contact with nuclear material . We still don 't know how that 's possible . You know , three months ago , my job made perfect sense to me . And then I pulled the Sylar case . Crime scenes with no fingerprints . Bodies frozen , brains removed . And now this guy . That 's two people wh- - make that three people who can do things I just can 't explain . What 're you saying , you think I 'm like them ? I don 't know what I think . But if we 're gonna find Sylar , I need answers . I have no idea how this happened . Well , then , I guess that just leaves Ted here . What 's this ? Detects radiation levels . As long as that 's dark green , we 're good . Oh--okay , what 's the bad color ? Not green . [ speaking Japanese ] Perfecto ! You ready for disco .

You can 't get your partner here to look inside my head ? We need to have it on the record . You burnt that doctor to the bone . Probably gave your wife cancer . How 'd you do it ? Ted . Ted , if you don 't let us help you , they 're gonna take you away , and nobody 'll listen to you . It doesn 't matter . Nothing matters . I killed my wife ! Audrey . You know , just lock me up . Execute me . Leave me the hell alone ! I wish we could , Ted . Look , I don 't know anything about any nuclear material ! Ted , Ted ! You know what ? Just relax . Do you want me to be the terrorist , huh ? Do you want me to be the bad guy ? Fine , I 'll blow this place apart . Ted ! Ted . Stop ! ( Matt ) Ted ! Just stop ! Do it . Ted . Do it ! Do it ! Ted , I know what you 're going through . Yeah , sure , you do . Yeah , like hell you do . Come on , Ted ! You 've seen what I can do . Okay ? Something is happening to me , too . Ted , I was able to read your wife 's dying thoughts . We 're just trying to understand what it is . Ted . Come on , Ted . Relax . Come on . Just take me back . Take me back to- - to when this all started , okay ? Just ... start from the beginning . Good . [ Ted thinking ] Blacked out . And when I woke up , everything started dying . You blacked out . How long were you out for ? Were you drinking ? When you came to , did you have bruises on your arms ? [ Ted thinking ] I 'll do you one better . What 's the matter , Parkman ? ( Chandra ) I 'm going . Don 't walk away . It doesn 't matter what you think . I 'm not asking your opinion . Yes . How could I have forgotten- - you never have before . Why should now be any different ? It is my life ! I 'm going , and that 's final . Has it never occurred to you that your actions could affect anyone else ? I don 't have time for anyone else 's feelings . Clearly ! The world needs to know about my findings . That 's all that 's important . The world doesn 't care . No one at the university cares . You 're becoming a laughing stock . I can 't cover for you any longer . I 'm not asking you to . How will you support yourself ? What will you do for money ? Oh , I 'll get by . How ? Do you know what doctors do in the United States ? They drive taxi cabs . It is one thing to publish a book in the comfort of the university . It is another to leave everything behind- - your wife , your family , your job- - chasing a theory that is pure fantasy . It 's a fool 's errand . We 'll see who will be the fool , won 't we ? Yes , I guess we will . Mohinder is right . I am abandoning my family , my job . You are . But I know you , Chandra , better than you know yourself . You will not stop thinking of this if you don 't go . It will consume you and , eventually , all of us with it . He 'll hate me for it . I 'm not sure that he doesn 't already . I should try to stay for his sake . Why ? He will never take her place in your eyes . That has always been the case . Who are you ? What do you want ? ( Ted ) I was in , uh , Kansas a couple months back . I 'd just made a big sale to the university hospital . Dialysis machines . [ laughs softly ] Commission was gonna give Karen and me enough money to ... [ sighs ] I-I went to the , uh , the hotel bar . Buy everybody a few rounds . There weren 't many people there . A couple from Wyoming . Some professors . A student from , uh , Haiti . The next thing I-I know , I 'm waking up in my car . It 's two days later , and I 'm in Tempe , Arizona . These weird cuts and bruises all over me . A couple of days later , I start to notice things . I 'd buy my wife flowers , and they 'd wilt . Okay , what about your health ? I mean , were you sick ? Do you have headaches ? Yeah . Headaches . But , uh ... Karen . The doctor said she had radiation poisoning . From you ? I was killing her . Are there any other bodies out there we don 't know about ? I 'm just saying . This is not his fault . He 's just trying to figure this out . Look , the same thing happened to me . Okay , I blacked out . I lost two days . You should 've told me about this . I should 've done a lot of things . Up until now , I haven 't told anyone . Not even my wife . And now I can 't stop hearing people 's thoughts . It 's painful . I 'm hearing things that I should not be hearing . Like what ? Things that could ruin lives . Things that ... could end marriages . The guy that you described , the student . He was , uh , Haitian . Big guy ? Bald ? Yeah , yeah . I 'm telling you , I think I saw this guy right before- - right before I blacked out , too . What are you guys talking about ? A Haitian guy ? These things that we can do , th--they 're not normal . We were cut . W-we were injected . Blacked out , who knows what they did to us ? Or how they changed us . [ door slams ] Time 's up . What ? ( Audrey ) Just a couple more minutes . And you , you shouldn 't even be here . Your badge has been suspended . Did he tell you where the nuclear material is ? Move it . He 's coming with me . What ? No , you can 't take him right now . Yeah , they can . Find the Haitian . ( Ted ) Find him ! You gotta get him back in here . I can 't . What do you mean you can 't ? You heard what he said . He 's gonna help me figure out what happened to me . Why did you lie to me about being suspended ? Okay , so I left that part out . But you have come to me and asked for my help . And I come running to you every single time . So now I 'm asking for your help . All right , get him back in here , so I can talk to him ! I 'm sorry . It 's out of my hands . That 's good . ( Rufus ) Mr. Bennet . Rufus . Ooh , I-I got next month 's parking sticker . Just need you to sign for it . I 'll take care of that later , Rufus . Ooh , sorry , sorry . How 's he doing ? Heroin 's out of his system . His body doesn 't want it anymore , but his mind still does . Coherent ? Very . You ready to meet him ? Yeah . ( Eden ) Isaac . This is Mr. Bennet , the man I told you about . Hello , Isaac . Drawing anything interesting ? [ sighing ] It 's nothing . Oh , you know that 's not true . You have the ability to paint the future . That 's something . Something very important . Feels like a curse . No , it 's a blessing . Don 't let anybody tell you differently . We 're gonna help you understand that . I 'm grateful you 're helping me . I 'm just not sure why you 're doing it . To be 100 % honest with you ... I need your help . How we doin ' ? Good . [ giggling ] Okay . [ muffled clinking ] [ metallic slice and liquid oozing ] [ crashing ] [ waitress screams ] [ sobbing ] Oh , my God ! Charlie ... She 's dead . ( Mohinder 's mother ) I know you miss him . And I know you feel guilty , too . Don 't . I had a dream last night . You and father were talking before he left . In it , you persuaded him to go . It was just a dream , Mohinder . No , I need to know if it was true . Come . Your father and I were married for 33 years . That is not an answer . Yes , it is . A marriage doesn 't last that long without allowing the other person to be who he has to be . But how could you allow him to abandon everything ? Just like that . I 'm afraid that answer is not as easy . In the dream , you said that I could never take the place of her . Who did you mean ? I suppose it 's time that you knew , now that your father 's gone . Mohinder ... you had a sister . A sister ? Her name was Shanti . And sh--she was five years old when she died , two years after you were born . Well , why didn 't I know this ? Because it was too painful to talk about , especially for your father . He loved her so much , he was afraid that you would compare his love . From the moment she was born , he was convinced that she was special . And she was special . ( Bennet ) These dates . Suicide bomber , 15 people dead . Train derailment , 9 dead . Earthquake , 81 . This girl , the one you 've painted here , and here , and there ... she 's my daughter . My Claire . This man here ... goes by the name of Sylar . He 's gonna kill her tomorrow night at her homecoming game . Why ? Because she 's special . Like y | | . | | | | And that makes her a target . Like me . You 're not the only one with special abilities , Isaac . There are others . Sylar is killing them . One at a time . [ clears throat ] If you know who he is , then why can 't you stop him ? Because nobody knows where he is . I need your help . I need you to paint this painting . I 'm sorry . I 've been trying . I can 't . Not without the drugs . Fine . I promise we will help you use your abilities without this , but right now , there just isn 't time . I 'm fighting to get my life back , and you want me to just throw it away . You know ... [ sniffs ] for many years now , a number of us have been tracking , locating , monitoring people like you . Sometimes the process goes smoothly , as in your case , and other times- - well , let 's just say some people misinterpret our motives , and then it can go ... very wrong . 14 years ago , there was just such a case , which , sadly , ended in a death . The woman left behind a baby girl who had no one to take care of her . My wife and I had been having a hard time ... conceiving a child of our own at the time . And--and it was like ... God had reached down and given us a miracle . Isaac . This is my daughter we 're talking about . I 'm begging you . Let me try one more time . Without it . [ metallic clunking ] Who are you ? What are you doing here ? Hey , wait ! Stop ! Come back here . [ man on radio ] I have a pickup at 59th and Broadway to JFK . ( Mohinder ) No ! Father ! Father ! [ groaning ] Fath- - Father ! [ gasping ] Stop ! Stop . Stop , stop , stop . Dad . Claire ? Honey , is everything all right ? Yeah , everything 's fine . Can 't a girl just visit her dad at work ? You never visit me at work . [ smooching ] Okay . I 'm busted . I have an emergency . A paper emergency . A paper emergency . A paper emergency . Ms. Roberts says we need a banner over the trophy case , and Jackie was all , " We don 't have paper that big . They don 't make paper that big . " So I thought I 'd stop by and try to be a hero . [ sighs heavily ] [ sighs ] Well , if it 'll make you a hero and maybe knock Jackie down a few notches , we might be able to find something that 'll work . Best dad ever . I 'm sorry , Mr. Bennet . We just have a little situation . You know what ? The sample room is right down there , Claire-bear . You take anything you need . Okay ? Thanks , Dad . First door on your left . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know she 'd be here . So what 's the problem ? It 's not working . He can 't do it . He tried . He 's just not there yet . We tried his way . Now we do it mine . He has worked so hard to get clean . You can 't ask him to do this . I 'm not going to ask him . You are . No ! No , you can 't make me do that . You knew this was a possibility . You said when we started that I would never have to do it again . You promised me . I know what you think . Who do you think taught you ? Do you even remember what you were when I found you ? You 're the easy way . I think we both know the hard way . [ sighs ] She say anything ? Sounded like she was scared ? No . She seemed very nice . She was . Too nice ... to die like that . Head ripped open . I ain 't never seen anything like it . We 're very sorry . Y 'all stick around . Need to take your statements . she was killed same way as the painter , Isaac when i saw him in the futrue that cannot be a coincidence then we shoule be extra careful there has to be something i can do she already dead i can bend time i can go back NO- - why else didi i get these powers if iam not suppoesed to help we are already on one stupid mission you donot need another i didnot do anything when those poker men died i cannot just sit back and do nothing again sure u can , it is easy i will just go back to yesterday , i will stop her from coming to work if she is not here she canot be killed but you can be you donot have control over you powers yet the last time you tele-ported you ended up in the futyre in nother country if i am too scared to use my powers ... then I don 't deserve them I have to try what about the cheerlead i wot be late , just count to five and i 'll be back we will celebrate my victory Hiro ? Hiro ? What is that ? Ensenada ? Mm . Pam Auden called ... to ask me why you punched Tom McHenry . I told her you didn 't . Did you ? Yeah . Yeah , I punched him . [ thinking ] He knows . Damn it , I knew it . You punched a superior officer ? That has to have some kind of repercussions . He may outrank me , but " superior 's " taking it a little too far . I got one month 's suspension . No pay . Jesus , Matt . Something happened ... between me and Tom . [ sighs ] You slept with him . Yes . Is it over ? Yes . Are we ? I don 't know . [ phone ringing ] Yeah , it 's Matt . He 's gone . What ? Ted . He escaped . ( man ) Watch out ! Do you hear me ? Yeah . Yeah , I heard you . [ drawer clanking ] | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ( Moh | | der ) You can run far . You can take your small precautions . | | But have you really gotten away ? Can you ever escape ? Or is the truth that you do not have the strength or cunning to hide from destiny ? What ? Nothing . Tsh . ( Mohinder ) But the world is not small . You are . And fate can find you anywhere .

 Something wasn 't right . that 's how I felt . there was a match between two teams that I had never heard of before I felt compelled to cheer for the losing team . I had the feeling that Haruhi was about to cause a commotion again . the phone . You don 't have to tell me . I know . right ? We 're all meeting in front of the station at exactly 2 o 'clock . Make sure you come ! I didn 't even get to say a thing . the phone . I know . What ? I forgot to tell you what to bring . Bring your swimming gear and lots of money ! make sure you go there on a bike . Over ! What ? I have this feeling that I knew exactly what Haruhi was going to say . that 's not right . it feels more like the exact same thing has happened before . Is this what you call deja vu ? Kyon ! You need to show more enthusiasm ! yeah . Sorry for making you guys wait . I just got here too . let 's go ! To where ? of course ! I guess we would be ... we should have summer activities like what people do in the summer ! you know . That 's why we 're doing this now ! This is our once-in-a-lifetime freshman summer vacation ! we 're going to the pool by bike . You guys brought yours too ? You and I are the only ones who brought bikes . Okay . Ready ? How could I possibly be ready ? Ready ! you can 't lose to Koizumi-kun . commence take off ! Damn it . 420 ) } Endless 420 ) } Eight Kyon ! so what are you so unenthusiastic about anyway ? You 're such a lazy person . Just whose fault is this anyway ? Whose fault is it ! ? the smell of chlorine ! This is what it 's all about ! let 's swim ! It 's a race ! Can 't she see this ? Sign : No Diving Hurry up and get in ! The water is nice and warm ! It looks like fun . It 's quite a pleasant scene . Don 't you think Suzumiya-san may have found a normal way of enjoying things ? there shouldn 't be anything happening that will endanger the world . If only that were true ... What 's wrong ? Koizumi ! Nothing . It 's probably just my imagination . We 've been through all sorts of things since spring . I think I might have become a little neurotic . let 's go swim as well . Hey ! there ! Wait up ! it 'd be more appropriate to call this place a " pool for the masses " than a " pool for the public " . This feeling ... I feel like I 've seen this somewhere before . Nagato seems to be bored . And then - Kyon ! That 's right . Then Haruhi said something like ... These two are my brigade members . They 'll listen to everything I say . So ask them anything ! let 's go have fun ! We 're going to play water soccer ! Come with me ! I guess deja vu happens all the time . Mikuru-chan ! Okay ! Sorry ! What 's this ? I came up with an action plan for the rest of the summer . It 's our plan of how to spend what little remains of the summer ! huh ? It just feels like there 's still so much to do . we don 't have any time left . Got it ? We 're going all out from now on ! do you have anything you want to do ? I would like to scoop up goldfish . OK . Goldfish scooping it is . Excuse me . Thanks . I wonder if there 's an Obon festival being held near here ? A fireworks festival would be nice too . I 'll go and find out . Don 't forget the goldfish scooping ! after all . Understood . we start tomorrow ! The next morning . from Haruhi . apparently . But Mikuru-chan and Yuki don 't have yukatas . So now we 're going to go buy yukatas for tonight . so I found a place that sells complete sets for a cheap price . You come along too ! Haruhi led us into a bulk clothing store personally chose Asahina-san and Nagato 's yukatas and then immediately proceeded to drag them into the changing rooms . After making us wait for nearly an hour - anyone would be yawning - the three of them finally showed up . Excellent ! You girls look great . after all . Especially Mikuru-chan ! It 's so cute ! Just what I 'd expect from myself ! Y-Yes ... it 's great ! Asahina-san ! There really is a lot of people here . Huh ? I 'm getting this feeling again . It should be my first time in a while . Why do I get the feeling that I 've just been here ? That stage ... That food stall ... What 's going on ? Mikuru-chan ! They have the goldfish scooping that you wanted to do over here ! Come here ! Come here ! Oh . Okay . Shall we do the same ? I 'll pass . You 're interested in these things ? Which one do you want ? I 'll buy it for you . It 's all right . This . Sure ! but ... we had a huge catch today ! Huge ! Thirteen fish ! we just kept one fish each . what 's with the mask ? I bought it . really . Let me borrow your back . just turn the other way . Hey ! Okay ! Next is fireworks ! Fireworks ! Let 's do that to finish today off ! Haven 't you ever heard of the saying " Don 't bite off more than you can chew " ? there 's summer vacation . but there was one thing bothering me . everyone ! We 'll go bug catching tomorrow . It will be the SOS Brigade Cicada Hunt ! The person who catches the most will be Brigade Chief for one day ! but have you finished your homework ? What are you talking about ? Homework like that only takes three days ! Finish off all that tedious stuff so you can actually enjoy yourself . That 's the right way to enjoy summer vacation ! Why is this person so smart ? we got what you could call a ridiculously nice day . we had the SOS Brigade Cicada Hunt . Everyone seemed to be putting up a fight but ... the winner was Haruhi . we were gathered for some random reason given a bunch of random frog costumes and ended up handing out balloons in front of a supermarket as a small part-time job . Are you all right ? I thought I was going to die . I 'm dead . Thanks for your work everyone ! You guys were great even in that heat ! The manager was really grateful ! I don 't need the old man 's gratitude . Where 's our pay ? This is it . I 've wanted this for a while now ! I was able to get the manager to give it to me as payment ! You made us do all that work just for the sake of getting that ? you can wear it whenever you feel like it . I give you permission ! That night . My slumber was again stolen away by none other than a phone call . Damn it . Yeah . Kyon-kun ... Don 't tell me this is ... Asahina-san ? it 's me . Something bad has ... If this goes on ... I 'll ... Um ... Koizumi . Why are you together with Asahina-san ? A slight problem has occurred . Do you think you could come right now ? Hell yeah ! I 'm on my way right now ! what exactly happened ? Kyon-kun ... I can 't go back to the future anymore ! Can 't go back ? can 't go back " as in ... that 's what happened . We 're currently looping through the same time period over and over again . What ? We 're currently looping through the same time period over and over again . We 're currently looping - do you have any idea what you 're saying ? I do . There is nothing more to it . I was talking to Asahina-san just now . Call me up too ! I happened to notice that the flow of time has felt strange lately . I guess you can say Asahina-san was the one that discovered it . I was able to confirm something . Confirm what ? We 're experiencing the same eternally repeating time period . it 's been continuing to repeat over and over again . You told me that already . the loop occurs from August 11th to August 31st . We 're caged up in an endless summer vacation . Yeah . " Caged up " would be the right term . endless summer . The world now has lost all time past September 1st . That 's the reason why Asahina-san is unable to return to the future . I guess it 's only natural that you can 't go back to a future that doesn 't exist . Cut the crap . What part of that nonsense is natural anyway ? Who the hell would believe that ? I was hoping that at least you would believe it . I 'll give you an explanation too ... I use * classified information * to communicate with the future and do things dealing with * classified information * . so I thought : " That is strange ... And then * classified information * . I was really surprised so I did a * classified information * . but it was completely * classified information * ... are you just using the term " classified information " as a replacement for censoring words ? Are we shut inside something similar to an enclosed space ? that 's not the case . One part of the time continuum has just been cut up . everything will be reset at exactly 2400 hours and we will return to August 11th again . That 's the process . the memories belonging to the entire human race ? That too gets reset . Everything starts over from the beginning again . huh ? I get the feeling that this can 't be helped . No . This one has nothing to do with Asahina-san . So who 's behind this ? Suzumiya-san . She might be unaware of it but a part of her might not want summer vacation to end . Does she have some sort of regret ? I believe so . It may very well be the fact that she feels like she still has something she needs to do during summer vacation . small issue into galactic proportions . I was wondering but aren 't you ? I 've finally managed to solve the riddle of the deja vu . Now that I think about it I 've come to understand that the imprints are the remains of a memory reset . right ? Don 't tell me everyone in the world feels it too . You and I are special cases . Just by being people who are close to Suzumiya-san we 've become the only people who are able to feel this . What about Haruhi ? Isn 't she at least aware of this herself ? It doesn 't look like it at all . It would probably be a lot more complicated if she did . with the deja vu I 'm thinking that there must be someone who has retained all of his or her memories of the repeated time . And who would that someone be ? I think you 'll know . is it true ? Yes . Do you remember everything ? Yes . So how many times has that repeating thing happened ? four hundred and ninety-ninth time we have met . four hundred and ninety-ninth ? 499 ? what are you talking about ? Are you being serious ? Yes . did we do the exact same thing over and over again ? That is not necessarily the case . In the last 15499 iterations in regards to going to the Obon festival 054 times we went twice . Obon minus the goldfish scooping occurred 437 times . 026 times . there have been six variations . Besides distributing balloons answered calls ... that 's enough . 499 times . That 's what Nagato said . about 594 years . living it over and over again while retaining her memories ? just how does it feel to have lived through all of this ? I heard something ridiculous again . The next day was stargazing . The venue was the rooftop of Nagato 's apartment . Koizumi prepared the telescope . I 'm bored . Let 's look for UFOs . stop it ! Hey ! Stop ! It 's going to break ! anyway ? I wonder about that . this problem will be relatively straightforward to solve . Why don 't we try this out for starters ? Suddenly hug Suzumiya-san from behind and whisper into her ear the words : " I love you " . And just who would be doing that ? There 's no one more suitable than you . I exercise my right to veto ! Shall I do it then ? I 'm just kidding . I 'm not qualified for that role . I would only put Suzumiya-san into an unnecessary state of confusion . The queue of vigorous summer vacation events continued . We went to the batting center ... And we went to a real fireworks show . We even took part in a fishing event . Other activities included a test of courage going to the theater swimming in the sea bowling and karaoke . None of us were exempted from singing . I knew that this still wouldn 't leave Haruhi satisfied so I didn 't make any effort to do anything . I ended up just passing through those days being miserable . that critical day drew ever closer ... August 31st . With that we 've pretty much completed our summer plans . I wonder if it 's okay like this ? But I guess that 's it . do any of you want to do anything else ? Fine . so it 's probably enough . Haruhi . You aren 't supposed to be satisfied yet . let 's call it a day then . I 'll let you have tomorrow off to prepare for school . Let 's meet in the clubroom in two days . Haruhi ! This again ! Deja vu ! And this feels stronger than before . I can 't let Haruhi go home like this ! If I let her go home all those ten thousand something weeks will just end up being repeated again ! But what should I do ? What should I say ? There should be hints in Haruhi 's words ! But what are they ? What did she say until now ? ! I don 't know . I can 't remember ... August 31st . Homework : unfinished . I don 't care anymore It doesn 't matter anyway . doing this homework would be meaningless . Will tomorrow come or not ? I 'll just have to leave it to myself to figure it out later .

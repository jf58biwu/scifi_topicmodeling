 We 're not a threat . We 're salvation . The world will have to deal with us . Previously on The 4400 : lily , are you all right ? - Where 's my wife ? - What are you talking about ? Mr. tyler , when your wife fainted this morning , she was a young woman . When she woke up less than a minute later , she was 50 years older ? Are you my mother ? Richard , I 'm dying . I understand there was an incident this morning . You attempted to harm yourself . You had no right to do that ! Don 't you understand who you are ? What you 're here to do ? I 'm injecting myself with a modified version of the promicin serum . I will have taught my body how to produce promicin . And then I will be the first non-returnee to develop 4400 abilities . That was T.J. Kim running from the courthouse . When she hit , T.J. drove every man in the building into a homicidal rage . Ever since we took them off the inhibitor , they 're either developing new abilities or they 're refining the ones that they 've got . So they are getting more dangerous . You saved my Iife . I owe you . You sold us out . I don 't guess we 'II be seeing her in court anytime soon . This is a message from the Nova Group . We are the defensive wing of the 4400 . Today , the world has seen what happens to those who try to harm us . A new era dawns . Hi . I 'II need your auxiliary rounds as well , Agent baldwin . Oh , yeah . Of course . I forgot again . - Thanks . You can go in . - Great . Hi , T.J. What do you want ? Dr. Burkhoff ? I have your prescriptions . hello ? Say something if you 're here . No , don 't . please . I 've been having migraines . How severe ? Bad enough . Don 't worry . They 're just headaches . I 've been getting them for years . Seven forty-five . You 're just in time for my wake-up call . These promicin shots , how many a day are you up to now ? Six . You 've doubled your dosage ? I thought you weren 't gonna do that without talking to me . We 're talking now . Look , I 'm training my body to produce a new neurotransmitter . And I guarantee you , I 'm not the only one trying . The moment the first 4400 manifested an ability , an arms race began . Someone is going to produce a promicin serum that will cause non-4400s to develop extraordinary abilities . It will happen . And the only questions are : who 's going to do it ? And who 's going to control it ? hopefully , someone with a highly developed sense of responsibility . And some judgment . Let me ask you , do you meet many people like that in your day-to-day affairs ? Do a Iot of them hold high-ranking government posts or sit on the board of giant pharmaceutical companies ? Dr. Burkhoff , I knew that you had some personality quirks , but I never pegged you for a cynic . I can 't afford to have a charitable view of human nature . There 's too much at stake here . If these experiments cost me some headaches , some sores , I 'd say that 's a price worth paying . WouIdn 't you ? I 'm here , right ? holy mother ! Why are we doing this ? Everything I 'm telling you , it 's all in my file . You know it already . relax , T.J. I just think it 's important we review everything you told the government so far . - Have we ? - Yes . I keep telling you , yes . That 's everything I know . Okay . Thanks for your cooperation . We 're just trying to consolidate information . You 'd be amazed how hard that can be in a bureaucracy . Yeah , well , I hope you don 't expect me to say , " You 're welcome . " What are you doing ? What , this ? It 's nothing . I 'm just wrapping up the interview . Get geared up . We 're leaving in two minutes . What for ? What 's going on ? Your partner registered to see T.J. Kim this morning . When Tom left the interview room , T.J. was dead . - What ? - Two gunshot wounds to the head . apparently , Tom snuck a small firearm into the interrogation room . By the time the guard went in and found T.J. ' s body , Tom had already left the building . - I 'm going to pick him up now . - Oh , wait , wait . This is Tom we 're talking about , here . There 's gotta be some explanation . Now , maybe T.J. used her ability on him . No , she had concentrated promicin inhibitor pumping through her veins . We tried to contact Tom , but he hasn 't been picking up . We need to get him in and figure out what happened . Okay , well just let me talk to him first . He trusts me . Look , this is Tom . Come on , we owe him that much . Yeah , okay . I wasn 't trying to drown myself . I don 't even know if I couId . Okay . isabelle , I just thought that after everything that happened with LiIy- - Shawn , this has nothing to do with my mother . I was teaching myself to swim . In your clothes ? I never wore a bathing suit before . I didn 't know what to get . And I 'm too old to ask for help . It 's embarrassing not knowing how to swim . Everybody 's got to Iearn sometime , isabelle . I Iearned when I was a kid . But I never was a kid . That 's why I never learned how to swim or how to drive . Or ever went out on a date . I keep reading about all these rites of passage . Like stuff everyone goes through before they grow up , yeah ? Yeah , but I am grown up . And I missed out on all of it . It 's not fair . - I 've got to catch up , so I made a list . - A list ? That 's pretty organized . well , isabelle , there is a pool at the Center . I couId probably teach you the basics . really ? Thanks , Shawn . Dad ? How old were you when you learned how to swim ? Oh , about 1 1 , I guess . Why ? You want me to teach you ? That 's okay . Shawn said he 'd do it . Oh , he did , did he ? well , make sure he doesn 't throw you in the deep end right away . That 's what my grandmother did to me . Look , isabelle . I 'm gonna be gone overnight . - If you need anything , go see Shawn . - Where are you going ? I 'm gonna take your mother home . I 'm putting her to rest . well , can I come with you ? I don 't think so . I 'm flying and to tell you the truth , I don 't think you 're ready to be away from the Center yet . You want to be alone with her when you say goodbye , don 't you ? Yeah . I guess I do . - Tom . - Oh , God ! You scared the hell out of me , Diana . What are you doing here ? Why is your gun out ? What the hell is going on ? Jarvis is on her way over , she 's got everyone with her . You need to come in . - Why ? What are you talking about ? - You shot T.J. Kim this morning . - What ? - You don 't remember ? Don 't remember ? I didn 't shoot anybody . - I 've been here all morning . - Can someone confirm that ? No , no , I was supposed to have a conference call with kyle 's attorneys . They cancelled , though . Look , I took a half a personal day , Diana . I went jogging . I wasn 't at work . You gotta stop saying that because two dozen people saw you there . Look , I don 't know what 's going on . I- - Maybe you 're bIacking out like kyle did . Maybe it 's something else . Maybe it 's like some 4400 ability . I mean , I don 't know , but you gotta come in . And what happens if I do ? - I get arrested for murder ? - You know , we 'II figure it out , okay ? Everyone wants to help you . You just have to come in . - You mind if I get dressed first ? - Oh , sure . Are you sure you remember everything you did this morning ? Like there 's no time gaps or anything ? You didn 't take a nap ? Because , Tom ... Tom ? Damn it ! Yeah , hi , it 's me . He got away . I don 't know how . They only sent one agent after him . Look , sorry . He got away . What ? No way . He 's an NTAC agent . He 'II be expecting that . Okay . You 're right . This has to happen . I 'II do it . I was letting him get dressed . I didn 't think he would jump from a second story window . well , obviously you underestimated your partner 's resolve . - Does he still seem blameless to you ? - I don 't know . Look , it was a really bad call and I take full responsibility . I 've alerted local law enforcement , the FBI . I 've told them that Tom is wanted for questioning in connection with a murder . He 's a fugitive now . Oh , don 't give me that look , Diana . I had no choice . Sorry . - It 's Tom . - Yeah . Tom . I 'm sorry I ran out on you . - Where are you ? - I didn 't kill T.J. I didn 't kill anyone . I believe you . But you have to come in , we can figure out what 's going on . - No , I 'm not going to jail . - No one 's gonna put you in prison . They did it to my son , Diana . Was it really him that pulled the trigger the day Jordan CoIIier died ? No , it wasn 't , was it ? It was that thing inside of him . - And where 's kyle ? He 's incarcerated . - You 're a fugitive . Every police department in Washington is looking for you . Now , some local cop wants to be a hero , spots you , you know how these things can end . No , it 's gonna end with me proving I didn 't do this . Look , dig around , Diana . There 's got to be some evidence that 'II clear me . Just help me find it . Did he give you a location ? Marco , help me out here . If you were trying to prove that your partner didn 't commit a crime that the whole world thinks he did , where would you start ? well , I guess I 'd start by pretending that my partner wasn 't involved . Okay , just think of it like any other case . What 's the first thing you do when you start ? well , look at the evidence . I mean , there 's a dead body . There 's the gun that Tom left behind . And there 's a bunch of people that saw him here . well , they 've got security cameras down in the detention ward , right ? You 're serious ? You 're really asking me for all that footage ? Of course I 'm serious . Is that a problem ? well , it 's just ... I gave all the tapes to him , Iike , an hour ago . What are you talking about ? I haven 't been up here all day . What is this , a joke ? Marco , come on . You were just here . You signed for all the footage from the detention ward . - This isn 't so hard . - That 's because I haven 't let go yet . AII right , I 'm gonna move my hands . Are you ready ? No , not yet . I 'm kind of comfortable . You 're kind of comfortable ? I 'm freezing . I don 't know what 's going on . - This pool is supposed to be heated . - Want me to make it warmer ? - Oh , you can do that ? - I think so . hold on . How do you do that ? I don 't know . How do you heal ? It 's not the same , isabelle . healing 's one thing . That 's what we can all do , one thing . Not me . I guess I 'm different . Shawn ? I 'm sorry to barge in . We 're scheduled to brief the board of directors . - That 's starting now ? - Five minutes ago . They 're on hold . alana . Thomas . What are you doing here ? I 'm in trouble . My bosses at NTAC , they think I did something . - I need you to come . - What are you talking about ? - I don 't have time to explain . Just- - - Thomas ! - hello ? - Alana . I 'm right down the street . I need you to come meet me . Honey , I 'm in trouble . Everyone thinks I killed somebody . - Who is this ? I know it 's not Thomas . - What are you talking about ? I 'm looking at Thomas right now . Honey , listen . That 's not me . The man you 're looking at , he can impersonate me somehow . I don 't believe you . He walked into NTAC and he shot someone this morning . alana , he 's dangerous , get away from him . Alana , listen to me . Your mother 's middle name is Madeleine . You wanted a dog when you were a kid , your parents gave you a bird . A parakeet named charlie . Listen , we made love last night . There were two candles burning . Just hold on . I 'II be right there . - Did I have a dog ? - I don 't have time for this . - What are you doing ? Let me go ! - What 's going on , Tom ? - Are you all right ? - Yes . - Where is he ? - He just ran through the back . Hey ! Did you see a guy come down this alley ? He looked exactly like me . - I didn 't see anybody . - You sure ? He 's gone . He 's gone . What do you mean ? He just ran out a few seconds ago . There was no one here . Just some kid ... It was him . It had to be . I had him . I had him . Had who ? What kid are you talking about ? The one who 's impersonating me . The guy who 's framing me for murder . He looked like you , he sounded like you . He was standing as close as you are to me right now . And he had me completely fooled . Don 't feel bad . He fooled everyone at NTAC too . At least we know what 's going on now . - He 's a 4400 , isn 't he ? - Yeah . Somehow he can pass himself off as you . Yeah , I 'm not sure how . I mean , maybe he 's got some kind of optical camouflage . He convinces your brain you 're talking to whoever he wants you to see . He 's a boy . Why would he want to kill anyone ? Not just anybody . T.J. Kim . The one member of the Nova Group we had in custody . I mean , think about it . It 's a good plan . You get rid of the one member of your cell who could testify against you . You compromise a government agent . And NTAC , the one agency that 's trying to hunt you down , is wasting their time chasing one of their own . alana . You might want to get in here . There 's all kind of people flashing badges everywhere . They say they 're NTAC agents . Look , stall them . I want you to go home . I want you to lock the doors and don 't open it until this is all cleared up . If I need to get ahold of you , I 'II use a password . How about Death in Venice ? Your favorite book . It 's a good choice . Listen , Shawn , thanks for letting me come in here . I know it puts you at risk . I just didn 't know where else to go . Look , you guys must have a database of 4400s here , right ? - Yeah . - I need to get a look and find out who this kid is . Here , I can pull it up on my laptop for you . This might take a while , you mind if I let myself out ? No , that 's fine . There you go . You know , uncle Tommy , you can stay here if you want . - I might take you up on it . - AII right . But , hey , you get the couch . Okay . Kidneys , huh ? That explains the blood in the urine . Kevin , we had a deal . I was gonna help you through this as long as it wasn 't compromising your health . well , guess what ? I 'm calling the hospital . But they won 't let me take my shots . Oh , no . You 're done with your shots . I know we had an agreement . And I 'II honor it . Just let me show you something before you call . What happened to your fingernails ? They fell off . dissolved , I guess you 'd say . God , if you 're trying to change my mind , you 're not doing a very good job . Kevin , what the hell did you just do ? Your tissue is healing itself from trauma that quickly ? Kevin , you 've developed a 4400 ability . It 's getting there . It doesn 't always work . Doesn 't always work ? You just put a scalpel - through the back of your hand . - I know . I was nervous about that . - These are fun to drive fast . - Yeah . You know , all that information about compression rates and gear ratios just seems completely irrelevant . well , you 're not driving home . Get out of there . You 're lucky you didn 't wrap my car around a pole . Is there anything on this list of yours that involves , you know , a little less risk of bodily harm ? We could have sex . Come on , you have a big bed . isabelle . Hey , hey . - No . - Why ? It 's on my list . It 's an important rite of passage into adulthood . It 'II be fun . I was good at driving . I 'm sure you 'd catch on real quick . I don 't know . For one thing , your dad would kill me . Why ? I 'm an adult . well , you are and you aren 't , isabelle . Let 's just say he has a right to have an opinion on the matter . I don 't know , isabelle . I feel like I 'd be taking advantage of you . But I want to . I 'm flattered . I really am . But I just don 't think you 're ready to make that decision . We barely know each other . I know you better than I know anyone else in the world . That may be true . It 's still not gonna happen . Lessons with isabelle going well ? Not lessons and it 's completely innocent . Do me a favor and don 't ask about them again . - This is Skouris . - His name is Boyd GeIder , Diana . He 's a 4400 . I know where he lives . Where who lives ? Who 's Boyd GeIder ? The kid who 's doing this . He can imitate me somehow . And not just imitate . He can be me . At least make you think he 's me . He lives with his mom . I 'm in SchenIey Park . It 's right by his house . well , can you wait for me ? I 'II be 1 5 minutes . I 'II wait . But , Diana , just you . Just me . We just got here . Where are you going ? SchenIey Park . I think we caught a break on Tom 's case . Tom ! Tom ! I didn 't tell anyone , Tom . Just Marco . At least I thought it was Marco . I Iooked across the park , you were standing there . It was you . - But it wasn 't . - Listen , tell me about it . You weren 't the one actually chasing yourself across the park . I mean , I don 't really run like that , do I ? It 's an amazing ability . Marco 's gonna have a field day over this . Good . Get him working on it . We 'II need a way to handle this guy when we get him into custody . well , wait , wait , wait . No , you don 't need to skulk around anymore . You can come in with me now . I 'm still on the hook for murder , Diana . No , you 're not . Boyd posed as you . He shot T.J. Kim . You 're not responsible . Listen , I just saw his abilities with my own eyes . That 's proof of something , right there . I will back you up on everything you say . Which means exactly nothing . Thank you , Diana , but you 're my partner . Everyone expects you to stand up for me . There 's only one way to prove I didn 't kill T.J. Kim . - I have to get Boyd GeIder . - Okay , Iet 's go . Are you sure you want to come ? I 'm your partner . Everyone expects that I 'II stand up for you . I should be back by tonight . I 've been taking my time , stopping off at all the places your mother liked . Everything okay ? You been going to your doctor 's appointments ? - Most of them . - Isabelle . - We 'II need to keep monitoring you . - l 'm fine . Shawn 's been taking good care of me just like you asked . He 's doing a really good job . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . He taught me the back stroke . He let me drive his car . And then I asked him to have sex with me , but he said no . He said you 'd be angry if we did . Is that true ? isabelle , you 're too young to be thinking about - that . - l am ? But I thought I was almost 20 . What- - ? How old were you when you lost your virginity ? It was- - Things were a bit different in my day . It 's not the same . It 's not ? Why ? You know what , isabelle ? I 'm not having this conversation with you over the phone . So , Shawn was right . You are mad . I don 't understand . What does NTAC wanna talk to my son for , anyway ? Look , he 's in some trouble we can 't discuss . We just needed to talk to him . well , he 's not here . He went away on a ski-trip with some friends and won 't be back till tomorrow . Ma 'am , your son is not on a ski-trip and this is serious . Is there any way you can contact him ? First , tell me what 's going on . I mean , what is it you think my son did ? Mrs. GeIder , there are a Iot of agents looking for Boyd . Situations like this can get very chaotic . people get hurt . The sooner we get to your son , the safer he 'II be . So why don 't you call him and convince him you need to see him . Boyd 's late . I wonder if he 'II even show . Let 's just give him another few minutes . Nice mom . Nice house . It makes you wonder . If the Nova Group can turn this kid , who else have they gotten to ? Everyone keeps telling the 4400 they 're here to save the world . - Whatever that means . - exactly . I mean , say what you Iike about Nova , they do seem to have a game plan . I 'm sure that helps their recruiting pitch . well , I 'm just guessing , but I don 't think that 's Boyd . How the hell did NTAC get here ? Maybe Boyd figured out it was a trap and tipped them off . - Thomas . - AIana , open up . What are you doing here ? NTAC agents are watching the house . They just drove away . They must be changing shifts or something . Come on , Iet me in . Death in Venice , okay ? Open up . I don 't want anyone to see me standing out here . Come on . What did you do with your key ? I lost it . I must have lost it while I was running around . Come on , it 's me , Tom , AIana . I gave you the password . please don 't make me . I don 't have anything against you . Tom , it says it 's your house . - AIana ? - l wrote a letter on your computer . You need to come sign it . - Boyd ? - lt 's a confession . It says you cracked under the strain of the murder charges against your son . You shot T.J. and now you can 't live with it . - So you decided to kill yourself . - Where is AIana ? What did you do ? It 's my get-out-of-jaiI-free card . See , you 're the only one who can identify me . Everyone else , they 've just been seeing double . - They 'II sound crazy . - l 'm not signing a suicide note , Boyd . - Put AIana on the phone . - Oh , you 'll sign . Because either I shoot you or I shoot her . It 's a trade . Your life for hers . You know what ? I don 't think I can let you do this , Tom . We need to call Jarvis . We need to block off the street . We need to surround your house . - He has AIana . - Tom , he wants to kill you . The least we can do is make it a little bit difficult for him . If it was Maia in there , would you call Jarvis ? Do you Iike it ? Why did you bring this to me ? You 're a young woman . A young woman should have a nice dress . This is gonna look good on you . See for yourself . Thank you . I see you 've been spending a Iot of time with Shawn . So ? well , I think it 's wonderful . Shawn 's a very isolated young man . He doesn 't get to spend much time around people his own age . I think you should get as close to him as you can . Matthew ? Shawn 's nice . And what I 'm doing with him is not for you and it 's not because I 'm trying to use him . Of course not . But eventually , isabelle , you and Shawn are gonna be on opposite sides of a very large ideological divide . So enjoy your friendship . But don 't let your emotions run too deep . If you do , it 'II make things more difficult later . - What things ? - You 'II know . It doesn 't match your eyes . You should take care of that . You were a beautiful woman . Both of you . You looked exactly alike . I never could figure out why . But one way or the other , I 've had a lily in my Iife for over 50 years . That 's all gone now . And I don 't know what I 'm gonna do . But it makes me feel better knowing the two of you are together . Forever . This is it for you , you know . I don 't know what kind of fairy tale the Nova Group sold you , but it doesn 't matter what happens to me or Tom . Your life is over . They sent you on a suicide mission . I volunteered . And I don 't think you 're in any spot to be giving me advice . You 're a 4400 . You 're special . You 're supposed to be changing things . Instead you live with an NTAC agent . And what are you going to change , Boyd ? You killed a girl . How does that make the world better ? T.J. Kim was a soldier . She would rather have me put a bullet in her head than betray us . Everyone talks about saving the world . meanwhile , for the past 50 years , everything 's been turning bad . One disaster after another . But we 're gonna show the world a new way . We 're gonna take them down a new path . By force if we have to . I mean , can 't you see ? The real catastrophe is to sit back and do nothing . Did you hear that ? Stop it . - Stop it , both of you . Stop or I 'II shoot . - Nice work , AIana . We got him . Shut up ! - AIana , Death in Venice . - Yeah , that 's the password . Come on , AIana . Give me the gun . We 'II call NTAC . It 's over . alana , it 's me , Tom . Ask me a question . Anything- - Wait , don 't fall for it . He 's probably read my file . He knows everything about us . Don 't listen to him . Ask me something about us . Something only I would know . Anything about us . Shut up , both of you . Baby , I am so proud of you . billy would have been proud . - You know about billy ? - Yeah . That was your son . He died in a car accident . alana , he did research . Anyone could find that out . Give me the gun . Just give me the gun . alana , give me the gun . - No . - AIana , give me the gun . - Come on . - Get down on the ground . What ? No , no . You 've got the wrong one . - Think about this . - I said get down . hold still , Boyd . Don 't move . You 're just a boy . I 'm a soldier . - And there are more of us every day . - Let 's go , soldier . Hey , welcome back . - Yeah , thanks . - Did everything go okay ? Yeah , thank you . And thank you for keeping an eye on IsabeIIe . Oh , well . It 's not a problem . I didn 't really do much . Yeah , well , thank you , anyway . I worry about her . well , you don 't really need to . She seems to be getting along really well . I 'm her father . It 's my job . And it 's harder with isabelle . people see her , they see a woman . A beautiful woman . And they might forget that inside she 's just a little girl . still , I 'm glad she has you around , to be a friend . Shawn . - How 'd you get in here ? - I can do stuff , remember ? Yeah . So , what 's up ? What do you need ? Just one thing . It 's on my list . First kiss . This isn 't smart , isabelle . Okay .

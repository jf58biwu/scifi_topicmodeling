The holidays , the holidays , Fun lies ahead ! The holidays have come ! Adventures are ahead ! So many things to do , Swimming , lying in the sun , playing ... ! The sun is shining and the sky is blue , And everyone is singing with joy : ALICE 'S BIRTHDAY Based on the book by Kir Bulychyov Please , don 't push ! The space zoo is closed due to technical problems ! Go home ... Hello , Alice . Hi ! Dad ? Where is everyone ? Have they been eaten or something ? Dad ... ! Hush ... Our cyber animal expert left the gate open . The deadly poisonous bush from planet Kurkum is at large . We are laying an ambush . Catch it ... ! Ouch ! The botanists have let you get completely out of hand . Chuck-chuck-chuck ... . kitty-kitty-kitty ... . tega-tega-tega It 'll eat you up , alright ! You caught it ! Just about . I 'll catch it ! Don 't covet what is not yours ! Re-take ... Oh , silly you ... ! They 'll take care of you in the zoo . You 'll have your own cage . How horrible ... ! Daddy , why does a space-zoologist need to learn History ? History ... What History ? Here I am , my precious friends ! Gromozeka ... ! My dear girl ! My friend 's daughter ! You 've grown so much ! One meter , thirty centimeters ! .. thirty-three centimeters . Dearie me ... ! If at the age of eight you are one meter thirty-three , then at eighty you 'll be fourteen meters and not less ... ! How will get into a spaceship then ... ! For starters , I 'm turning ten soon ! Secondly , humans still haven 't figured out when we , Chumarozians , crack a joke ! Have you flown in to celebrate my birthday ? Of course ! And when is your birthday ? In a week ! Oh ! I have a present for you ! Wow ! What is it ? It is a very special present ! When you learn what it is you 'll jump on one leg with joy like ... .. an Astrian mushroom ... ! But human traditions forbid giving birthday presents beforehand , don 't they ? Quite right ! Why did you tell me about it , then ? Now I 'll be waiting for it for the whole week ! Impatient little lady ... ! Gromozeka ( half whispering ) : Well , then ... My present is a trip deep into the Galaxy , to planet Koleida . Wow , that 's so cool ! Hold on ! Catch it ! Wait ! Come back ! Seleznyov ! Will you let Alice go with me ? One doesn 't decide these things when running ! Does one decide them standing still , then ? Look , it 's Seleznyova again , with another monster . I won 't be able to fly with you , Gromozeka . How come ? ! You were so eager just a second ago ! You see ... at school ... Well .. Well .. I ... err ... They won 't let me go ... . I 'll go to your school myself and have a word with your teacher ... Oh , don 't , please ... ! Why not ? Our teacher Yelena is so jumpy . She is scared of spiders , frogs and ... other creatures ... Well , that 's not my fault ... No , it 's not ... ! But she may be sacred of you . Scared of me ? I 'm the most handsome man in town on my home planet Chumaroz . You are most handsome here , too . Simply ... not everyone knows it . Don 't get upset , Gromozeka , I won 't be able to come . Well , Seleznyova ... You flunked the History exam ? Astronaut Ivan the Terrible ! Teehee ... . Re-take ... Alice you can 't imagine how much you 've let me down ! .. History ... Ivan the Terrible ... all 's well ... .... that ends well ... I think it 's packing up ! ... wrote myself off ... I suppose , it got poisoned by the cactus ... I 'll have to study history all summer , I suppose . Do you know who is the best History teacher in the whole Universe ? No ... The famous Chumarozian archeologist Gromozeka ! And what will we tell my dad ? Well , definitely nothing about your bad mark . Hey , Seleznyova ... Where did you get that poison for your record book ? Last year we discovered a dead planet , called Koleida . It was once inhabited , but a century ago everyone suddenly died ... even animals ... and insects , and birds , and fish . Only debris remained . The wind howls and the rain never stops . And why did everyone die ? I have a theory . I went to the Time University and persuaded them ... to bring a new machine to the planet ... A time machine ... ? Yes , somebody will travel into the past and if my theory proves right , we 'll be able to change ... .. find out what this dead planet was like a century ago ... How interesting ! What 's so interesting about it ? Nothing 's alive on the planet . Unfortunately , there will never be a pavilion with Koleida 's fauna in the Moscow zoo ... And what if the animals are hiding deep in the underground ? What if I can find them ? Tell me , old fox , why do you insist Alice come with you to Koleida ? Why ? I want to make her happy . Somehow , I don 't believe you . Don 't worry , Professor , I 'll keep an eye on her . Bye , Dad , bye ! Maybe we should tell Dad about the bad History mark ? Wait ! Here it is the time machine ! Hi , Gromozeka ! Hi ! Stepan , an immediate participant of all historic events on Earth ! Handle with care ! Oh , a one-eyed kitten ! Poor soul ! Oh ! Professor R-r-r ! An acting member of the Linguistic Society . Don 't scratch , please ! The Galaxy 's top expert in dead languages . I am so glad you accepted our invitation to take part in the expedition ! Ouch , it hurts ! Alice Seleznyova the youngest of our scientific assistants ... I am sorry , professor ... Baby talk ... ! A two-eyed girl ! Poor soul ! Alice Seleznyova ... hm .. I hope there won 't be any rule breaking ? I hope so , too , Commander . Here it is " Koleida ! It is so much like Earth ! Attention ! All crew go to the hospital module . You know ... for jabs and stuff ! Hey ! That 's not fair ! You said there was nothing alive on Koleida ... Well , yes which means there are no live viruses or microbes there , either ! Nothing is alive there ! A matter of precaution , really ... Gromozeka , I don 't like injections ... ! I 've developed an allergy to them . Me , too . Be patient . Let go ! For additional safety I 've asked the doctor to give you ... err ... some extra jabs . Well , thank you ! Is that another birthday present for me ? Are you afraid ? No . Gromozeka was wrong to start it all . And what did he start ? I 'm not sure . He is always up to something . He sure is ! He decided to stab me to death with these stupid injections . And ... have you ever heard of the space plague ? No . Long ago when you , Alice , were even not born an expedition returned to Earth from Sector 18 ... To undergo quarantine the expedition docked to a station on Pluto . That was what saved Earth from death . Everyone from the expedition was ill with an unknown disease ... The best doctors from every planet tried to understand the disease . It was immune to our medicine and penetrated the thick walls of isolation wards and even spacesuits . And so it was called the space plague . Ouch ! Have they found how to cure it , then ? The virus can mutate and pretend to be harmless . I am sure the space plague is a conscious being . Conscious ? Yes ... ! When billions of viruses cluster they give birth to an evil mind which strives to kill everything that lives ! And that is that . How is it looking , Commander ? Everything 's quiet . We 'll camp near that town . It 's called Luklyansk . And what if they were attacked by the space plague ? Don 't be afraid , Alice , we destroyed the plague long ago . No one has heard any news about it for a hundred years , now . A hundred years ? This is a vaccine ... .. to cure the space plague . Just in case ! Like an earth saying goes there 's no fence from plague fortune . No fence from ill fortune ! One is worse than the other . Let 's go ! Don 't be lazy , my friend Better get started There is so much to sort out Don 't be lazy , just look around ... Nothing ventured , nothing gained It is so very true . Nothing ventured , nothing gained So you better get going , my friend No time for idle talk Time for hard work ... Hup , two ! And let the words of this song instruct you . Nothing ventured , nothing gained It is so very true ... . Believe me ! Nothing ventured , nothing gained So you better get going , my friend get going , then ! ... it 's so very true , yeah ! That 's just what I was afraid of . Commander ! Can you communicate with the space plague ? No communication ! And don 't leave the camp ! That doctor must stop scaring children with his stories about thinking viruses . Discipline ! Am I stuck in the camp , then ? ! No discoveries can be made like this ! Maybe , this Koleida is not dead at all . There must be someone still alive . Everyone could be hiding not knowing that we 've come . I 'll find them . And they 'll ask me who are you ? ' And I 'll say we came to help you ! ' And they 'll be like wow ' . I am not afraid ... .. and there 's no one here . Who 's there ? Light ... how can it still be working ? Windmills ! Could everyone really be dead ? A pity ... Oh , stop dithering ... Uhhh ... Help ! Help ! Alarm ! What 's happened ? Are you alright ? There ... in the building there 's something big ! It sprayed me with something stinking ! It must be poisonous ! Where 's Alice ? ! Just what I thought ! ... Alice ... .. Seleznyova ... Where could she be ? Hush ... . Be careful , please . Will you be so kind as to explain , partner , why you brought along this little nuisance of a girl ? A galactic bully ! Got me wet with some smelly eek ! I am a renowned scientist , professor of most universities in the Galaxy ! Don 't exaggerate , professor ? Questioning my merits ? No , the gravity of Alice 's mischief . Maybe I 'm exaggerating , but not a great deal . Please , professor , why everything 's so small on Koleida ? Why this ... why that ... ? Koleidians were diminutive in size ... .. just like you are . So , on Koleida I would be a grownup ... My little girl , to be a grownup ... Careful , please . ... it has little to do with height . It 's all about knowledge and experience . Do you want me to squirt you ? No ! Well , you are certainly not a Koleidian in height . Well , I understand the buttons but why did they have to wear these strangleholds ? Try asking dogs why they have to wear theirs . I thought we didn 't wake anybody . Well , hop in . Is Gromozeka asleep ? Yes , quite loudly , too . Well , it 's even better this way . He would surely see us off with good cheer . And we are simply starting an experiment . Don 't get distracted . What 's wrong with him ? He 's learning the language . Professor R-r-r has a unique method ! ( Koleidian ) Bunto todo barakata ah vah ? ( Koleidian ) Krah barakatah tah bUntah . ( Koleidian ) Toh buntAH ! It 's not a training ground . No one will get you out of there ! ( Koleidian ) Botoh kataboroh ! Don 't forget to bring fresh papers ! You call a hundred-year-old paper fresh ? ! What did he say ? Simply a play on words ... Gromozeka 'll be very upset you didn 't take him . No , he won 't . ( on the poster ) SAFETY MEASURES ( on the poster ) Don 't leave the time machine unattended when in operational mode But will there be a time machine in the past ? Of course not ! Then , how will he come back ? He 'll mark the place of his arrival . ( on the poster ) Table 1 Next time he 's there ... ( on the poster ) Table 5 ... he 'll be transported automatically . No outside help will be needed . And what if ... ( on the poster ) Table7 ... a cow or a bird gets there ? The machine won 't work unless the one who traveled to the past goes there . And what if he 's injured and can 't get there ? ( on the poster ) Table 8 Nonsense ! Anything can happen . He 'll have to count on himself alone . .. no one will be able to travel to him and help . Attention ! Phew ! That 's it ! Here we are ! Well , well ? Here are your papers . Are you alright ? We need to have a meeting , immediately ! Seven forty-one , local time . We were right about the style of dress . Good morning . Could you tell me where I could get newspaper ? They are all sort of rundown here . A newspaper , please . Are you feeling ill ? Please , call for the doctor . I took him to hospital ! It 's the plague ... Nonsense ... ! Where could it come from ... ? Listen to this ... .. having returned a week ago , the first astronauts are still ... That 's right ... ! What 's right ? Everything 's right ... Now , it 's clear how the space plague got to Koleida . Can we help them somehow ? How can you help someone who died a century ago ? But you can ... ! How ? You know , everyone thinks I 'm too simple and direct ... How is it bad ? Well , they are , of course , right , to some degree . I can see not only the past , but the future , too . Why , do you think , I asked you to go with us ? To give me a birthday present . Exactly ! But it 's not all . I was on my way to Earth thinking : well , here is that planet Koleida infested with plague ... ' You knew Koleida was infested ? ! Yes . And you figured out how to save it ? Yes ! Well ? Have you not guessed it yet ? I decided to send Alice into the past . And why ? So that I ... That 's right ... ! So that you could get to the point in time when the space plague came to the planet ... .. and neutralize it . What then ? No plague the planet 's saved ! Everyone is happy and a billion people are alive , thanks to a little girl ! It 's so thrilling ... ! Hush ! It 's going to be our secret . And why me ? Because you are the spitting image of a Koleidian girl ! I 'd do it all by myself but they 've never seen a Chumarozian before . Maybe they are just like your History teacher , a bunch of loonies ! And why is it a secret ? I thought you were smarter than that . Imagine me telling your father : Seleznyov ! ... ' ... I want to send your daughter deep into the past of an unknown planet so that she could save it from a lethal virus ' . Well , actually my dad 's OK with it , but ... I think he 'd say not for love or money ' . Not for love or money ! Meddling with a planetPI 's past is strictly forbidden . You should 've told us about your thoughtless intentions back on Earth ! But then you wouldn 't listen to me ... ! No thoughtless intentions . I carefully planned it all ! Alice ... is the same height as Koleidians ... She 'll easily pass for a native ... You tricked Alice into it ... ? Me ? ! I tricked no one ! Alice is an experienced person , She 'll cope just fine ! We are leaving Koleida first thing tomorrow ... Any further research should be negotiated with the Galactic Council ! We are ruined ... ! Ruined ... ! They 'll drag a whole bunch of experts here ... .. only to announce it is too much risk for the Galaxy and quarantine Koleida for good ... Well , I 'm glad you get it yourself ... ! I get it , indeed ! Ahchoo ! Bless me ! ... getting ready to go ... Don 't forget your jumper ... Are you sleeping ? Yes , I am ! Hey , you sprayed me with this eek before . Oh ... professor ... I was just ... you know ... just about ... . ... to break the rules ? I think , the commander won 't like it ! Quiet ! You 'll wake everyone up ! We 're talking about the whole planet here ! I need to try it . Well , if it 's our only chance . Our ? I 'm going with you ! I 'm the spitting image of their kittens . So , you 'll be traveling with one . This way I can keep an eye on you . Oh , I so don 't like being looked after ! Do you know a word of Koleidian ? No . And the road ? Local traditions ... ? Thought as much ! A planet-saver ... ! Baby talk ! No one else is . How 's this ? Will do , I guess . I 'll have to travel naked , though . Well , not really naked . Thanks , but I 'm afraid we have different viewpoints here . Take it . You already know how to spray . Paint ? Well , can 't you see ? I am green ! What 's so funny about that ? ! Sorry . Simply , one of my astronaut friends is called Green . He is actually ginger . And very grumpy ! What are you hinting at ? Wow , professor , you 've got a tail ! What ? Oh , no . My neighbour 's got a fur coat . I borrowed a piece of it . Looking good ! Start learning the language ! Mu .. mmy ... You 'll squash me ... let go ... ... I can 't breathe ! I 'm no kitten , you know ! So sorry professor ... I lost my head ... You better find it quick . Mark the spot . We need to get to the town . First thing to check is whether ... What are you doing ? Put it away ! But it 'll be quicker this way ... My little girl , we 're in the past ! They haven 't invented this toy yet ... And if we screw it all up , they never will . Oh , bother ! You better not waggle your tail like that . It doesn 't look authentic . Why don 't you try it yourself ? ! Wait here , I 'll have a look . My tail ! Don 't . Shoo ... stop it ! ... stop ... ! Give the tail back ... ! It 's not yours . Give it back now ! Good afternoon . Your pussy cat attacked the prof ... .. my kitty and tore its tail off . Could you be so kind and get it back , please ? Fafalya , give the tail back . Good pussy cat ! I 've never seen such well-behaved kitties ! Where do you come from ? I 'm not local . Could you tell me if the astronauts are back yet ? You 've got a funny accent ... and a dress and your cat is odd . Nothing odd . Have a closer look at your beast of a cat ! You what ? We 're ... foreigners ... Yeah , right ... . foreigners ... ... in a forest ... in the morning ... Fafalya , let 's go ! I think he took us for spies . So cool ! They 'll never believe it at school ! Unfortunately , the local police will ! Run while we can ! I had to sew on wings instead of the tail . Birds of a feather , ugh , ugh ... Come on , catch up ! Hello . Do you have today 's newspaper , please ? No , lady , all the papers were sold long ago . ... with all this endless talk about the astronauts and our town 's own Tolloh ! Everyone went to welcome him back . How far is it to the space port from here ? Are you a foreigner ? Yes . I guessed it from the very beginning . You need to get to the capital . They are landing at six in the evening ! Hurry up , the train leaves in ten minutes ! Thanks . I 'll make it ! Wait ! Wait for me ! Hello ! No room ! I 'm sorry It 's alright . Get in ! What 's happening there ? I 've seen him somewhere ! Young lady ! You can 't sit there ! Sorry ... She 's got a one-eyed kitten ! Don 't touch anything here ! Got it ? ! You , meanie ! He-he , a flying chicken . Let me sew your tail back on , Professor . I 'll do it Ouch ! One minute I have a tail , the next it 's gone ... soon I 'll get a split personality ! 'ASTRONAUTS COMING BACK ' ... 'SPACE PORT : MAXIMUM SECURITY ENSURED' I 'm afraid it 'll be no easy task to get to the ship . That 's where we could be using the transporter . Flight Engineer Tolloh . We 've stopped ... it 's already eleven ... Are you OK ? It seemed for a second your kitten was sewing its tail back on ! An old woman 's imagination playing tricks ! Say ' meow ' , Professor . Try to act your part ! I beg your pardon ? ! Am I disturbing you ? We 're running a bit late . You alright , Kitty ? Stop mocking me ! Good , then . We 're just about to move . Would you like some ? Are you going far ? ... to welcome the astronauts back . Me , too . My grandson is there . Finally , good luck ! Say it again ? I know him ! His name is Tolloh . Everyone knows our Tolly now ! Don 't cry ! We 'll cure him ! Cure whom ? Our Tolly 's never even had a runny nose ! Otherwise why would they have chosen him ? Passengers are asked to have their tickets ready for inspection ! I 'll be right back ! Your ticket , please ! I have no ticket ! A stow away ! No , it 's a kitten . You should be ashamed , young lady ! Pay the fine , please ! I have no money ! I need to get to the space port ! I 'll show you ' space port ' ! Let go of me ! You 'll be sorry ! ( thought bubble ) Movement trajectory What are you up to , Alice ? No ... Doctor ! Don 't get any closer ... I think ... I 've been thinking . Like a plague expert do you think there could be still any viruses here ? Hey , Doc ! Where are you ... ? It 's so difficult to be doing nothing , simply waiting . It 's a pity we can 't contact Alice and the Professor ... Sorry , wrong room number ... So , after all , it was your idea ? Gromozeka , you are an irresponsible Chumarozian adventurer ! I simply think we can 't sit , twiddling our tentacles , while innocent Koleidians are falling victim to the virus ... ! You are no longer head this expedition ! So , what 's with this plague then , Doctor ? I think I 've caught it already . What ? And you 've been quiet about it ? Are we nearly there yet ? Another a hundred and fifty kilometers ! How about we use the transporter ... ? Will it definitely get us there ? It should . The battery 's fully charged ... I have a bad feeling about this ' should ' ... I 'd have never climbed on this thing alone . Trusting a child with such a dangerous thing which has neither a parachute nor an ejection seat ! What 's taking you so long ? Just a second ... Stay close to the ground ... and farther away from buildings and roads ! And don 't get us lost ! I 'd give you directions but I think it 's best for me to stay in the bag . I think ... I 've lost ... It 's worse than baby talk ! It 's a toddler 's blabbering ! What will we do now ? Close it . If the plague has already spread on the planet it 'll be like putting out a fire with a watering can . We won 't hold out long . See where your gamble has led us ... ! Now , Alice is our only hope ! Open up ! Let us go ! Goodbye , piggies . It wasn 't a pleasure to meet you . Just a second , Alice . Gentlemen ! I am a renowned scientist ... Gotcha ! Professor ! Professor , what 's happened ? What are you doing here ? Talking to pigs . What about ? Well what can you talk with pigs about about their dirty life , of course ! And where 's professor ? Who ? Have you seen a little kitten anywhere ? Who ? What time is it ? Half past five ! Half past five ? ! Catch it ! Listen ! Alice ! Over here ! I ruined it all ! Now the planet will die and I I 'll die , too . That 's my toy ! fifth sixth ! There was another one , one with only eye . Look at this mutant ! Where do they get them ? Stop fighting ! I 'll make soap out of you ! Wait ! Listen , please , I am a professor , an acclaimed academician ! I can 't be turned into soap ! A talking cat ! Wait , I 'll make him sing . And what are you waiting for ? Are you out of your mind ? Catch them ! Now , I will make you sing and even dance for you , shortie ! Who are you ? No one . What are you doing here ? Crying . Well , you can play with it if you want . It was you with your parents on the train earlier , wasn 't it ? Yeah ! They are going to see the astronauts ! They didn 't take me along ... left me behind with my mean grandma ! Why didn 't you go to the space port ? I was late . Lady , stop crying . Breaking news from the space mission control centre . The first space mission was a success , but the landing 's been postponed . What ? ! A meteorite collided with the ship 's navigation system . Flight Engineer Tolloh made a space walk to fix the damage . So , that 's how the plague got onboard ! The astronauts are feeling fine and are send their greetings to us all ! Now listen to the song of their choice . Thieves ! Always faithful to the call of the sky The proud eagles People of the sky Again the sky calls the brave The long flight is calling There , visiting new planets We will finally find out If there was once life It may be that no one awaits us in the stars But the ships will reach their goal The meeting will be a dream Meeting a proud star in the night There , visiting new planets We will finally find out If there was once life So , there 's still a chance to save them ! Do you know how to get to the space port ? Mum said there is a bus going there from the market . The market ? Thanks ! Bye ! Hey , No One , I want to get to the psase port , too ! SPACE port ! Whatever ! You can 't . You 're too little . Dad says I 'm big enough . For a chamber potty , yes ! Is the market there ? No , it isn 't . Take me with you ! Then , I 'll show . What 's your name ? Bolloh . I 'm Alice . We will see the proud march The march of the planets in one , straight line We will salute every one of them With a flash of the ship 's powerful engines There , visiting new planets We will finally find out If there was once life Well , I haven 't learnt how to waggle it . Here , kitty , kitty , kitty ... You just look at it ! No tail , one eye , and it turns up its nose ! Shoo , ugly ! Excuse me ! Sorry ! How will we get there ? Can 't you see from here ? Oh it 's you ! Hello ! Hello , dearie ! Where did you meet that boy ? Is it your son ? He got lost . We 're looking for his mum . Will you help us , please ? To find his mum ? To see the astronauts ! Tolloh ... This is my granddaughter . You are strange lady after all . Open this , please . What have you got here ? Vaccine Here , hold them . There 's my grandson ! This is my granddaughter ! And this is Bolloh . Show me your flowers . There 's my grandson ! Give me the flowers , dearie . They are coming . But where are you off to ? Holt ! Holt ! Alise ! Catch them ! Stop ! Stop ! Let go of me ! Get her ! She is a terrorist ! What is it ? Let me have a peep ! Alice ! The night is not a toy for children what 's lost ? I was at your home . All Koliedians died because of the space plague . So we decided to travel back in time , to save you all . This capsule held a vaccine . That 's how you helped me save your planet ! Great ! We save them all , they send us to prison ? No worries . My friends will work something out . I 'm not worried . They locked me in a naughty cupboard a hundred times . They let you go , eventually ! I 'm worried . You 're a grown-up . No one will spank you ! I 'm not a grownup . Just a little older than you are ... Oh .. in fact , a hundred years younger ! Now , back on Earth ... even my grandma 's not been born ! Huh ! And I bet you cat can talk ! It 's not a cat ! It 's Professor R-r-r , a big expert in languages known all over the Galaxy ! He is so little and feeble . I don 't know what will happen to him in this situation . Alice ! Dear , R-r-r ! Is it you ? At your service ! Wow ! He does speak ! After all this , one 's sure to speak and even shout in Cat ! Pull at the bars ! Goodbye , little one ! I 'm not little ! Is it true that I saved the planet ? Yes , you 're a real hero ! Stop chatting ! Mum , dad ! Hey , you ! Forward ! Over here ! Shush ! My turn . No , no Get them . Go up . Quick . They make so much noise . And some people need to get up early tomorrow ! That 's it ! They 've caught us ! Hmm ! I 've already explained to some of the locals what the word hospitality means ... ! I don 't think they 'll listen to me this time ! Professor , I thought you were afraid of heights ! Terribly ! But I 'm playing my role well enough to start meowing . Darned terrorist ! How did she do it ? Don 't know . But she couldn 't plan it without any help . You need a whole gang to do it ! If only I could get them now ! Shoo ! Shoo ! That was close . We 'll wait here . Well , now I know who scared all my birds ! It wasn 't us ! I didn 't do anything ! Cross my heart ! It seems you need some help here ! I need to get to Luklyansk . Luklyansk ? ! That 's very far away ! What a coincidence ! I 'm just about to tour Luklyansk ! What a lovely kitty you have ! I 'll show you a kitty ! Let 's run while we can ! But how will we get there ? Somehow , using our own feet . It 's too risky with this magician ! A fishy bloke . We have no other choice ! For goodness sake , I 'm ... Hold your ... cat ... or it 'll run away ! Professor , have we made it ? Have we saved them ? I don 't know , the future will tell ! And what if the result 's the same ? Maybe it 's for the better . To be honest , I don 't like these aboriginals . They are not worth the risk ! But they got into trouble ! We had to save them ! I doubt that the saved ones want to catch you to give you praise ! I don 't need their praise . I 'm glad they are saved . Professor , where is your star ? Over there . Malakashta . What about my Sun ? You can 't see it from here , it 's too far away . Taken hostage by meteor showers In the cold night There lives in unknown sorrow The warmth of a home left behind The light of love The light of the Earth Is always with me , just like my home The light of love The light of the Earth You are my guiding lights in the dark , On the way to a boundless world The blurred Milky Way calls to us Just like an unsolved riddle , a child 's dream The light of love The light of the Earth Is always with me , just like my home The light of love The light of the Earth You are my guiding lights in the dark , On the way to a boundless world Good luck , girl ! Say to Gromozeka ! Who ? Gromozeka ... I think ... The scarecrow . Hey , alien girl ! How was the trip ? What trip ? To the space port ... I saw through you from the start ! Fafalya , get her ! Fafalya ? ! Come on then ! Come on ! Transporter ! My transporter ! Let me just get to you ! Don 't you drop me ! I don 't want to become soap ! What was that ? ! Fafalya ! You ... Everything 's ruined ! Woohoo ! We 've made it ! Of course , we 've made it . After all I lived through ... We 've saved the planet ! Look , professor , we are in the middle of a festival . Maybe it 's to praise us ? Why don 't they pay any attention to us , then ? Alice ... ! Dad ... ? Dad ! What are you doing here ? Gathering fauna samples , where have you been ? Gromozeka is numb as a Cassiopeian fish . I ... the professor and I ... How do you do . Acting member of the Galactic Linguistic Society , professor , supervisor and founder R-r-r , how do you do ! Pleased to meet you , Dad I mean , Professor Seleznyov . Dad , I flunked my History exam . Alice ... ! But I 'll pass it next time , promise . But for your birthday , Alice ... Alice ! You ruthlessly broke the rules and you deserve severe punishment ... but ... honestly , well done ! Um , um ! You both well done ! And here 's your birthday present ! Do you recognize it ? It 's ... Bolloh ! A classic author of Koleidian sci-fi ! And good one , too ! May I ... well .. ... And there emerged a ship ... ' ... The door opened to reveal a gigantic monster instead of the astronauts ... ' ... There was no time to lose ! I pushed a police officer out of my way and lunged at the monster , shouting : For Koleida ! What utter nonsense ? ! Well , you know , Professor ... writers have a rich imagination . All together now ! Happy birthday , Alice ! Blow ! Need any help ?

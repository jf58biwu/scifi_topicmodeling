 In the northwest coast , while the astronauts carry out the final preparations for the launch of Friday of the spaceship in orbit ' Antares' from there toward Venus and beyond . Today , they had their final medical examination and now , they pose for the official portrait in mission control The next few days , the crew will be devoted to say goodbye to Earth and to their friends Which one are you ? I am not on this one . ... in this difficult , 6 years long , historical mission ... Which one are you ? Pap , I am not on the mission ! OK ? I didn 't make on this one . I know that . I know that . Mars ... My old man calls space travel a fools game ... He says human beings are 60 % water . They eat , sleep , defecate , cant follow directions , and explode like pinatas when exposed to the vacuum in space . Lately ... I 've been wondering if he is right . Are you OK ? Calliope , do you read ? Mars - 2042 10 years Earlier Sharon , we got to keep moving . We have to get out of this . Calliope , this is Zeus . This storm is on the rise . You need to get off the planet . Zeus , they are 100m from us . Let me go out , I can lead them in . Negative . Do not leave the Lander . Climate parameters are on minimum . 30 seconds . Come on , guys ! 70 meters , we can hold . Zeus , we are holding on 25 . Climate parameters are on minimum . Calliope , I am taking your lunch controls . Donner ? Climate parameters are on minimum . Donner , did you close that valve ? - Just give them two minutes , Mike . - We don 't have two minutes . You will die , the mission will fail . I want that lander off the planet now ! Donner ? Sharon ? Donner , we launch ! Climate parameters are on minimum . Sharon ? - Donner ? - Open the damn valve , Donner ! Launch now . Launch now . - Launch now . - God , forgive me . 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 ... 5 , 4 , 3 ... 2 , 1 , 0 ! Oh , my God , Paula , you 're still looking a little dry there . Don 't you dare ! I am sorry , Paula ! You will have years to forgive me . Remember that feeling ? Oh , yeah . Best day of my life . Everything seems funny , it all looks good . Yeah , it all looked good . Yes , it did . How do you do this all the time . This one is particularly disgusting . Oh man , you 're such a geeky , you make me look cool . Oh , I 'm so looking forward to this honeymoon . Good , because we couldn 't afford Niagara Falls . You are so cheap ! - Congratulations , Commander . - Thank you , sir . If you call me " Mrs. Commander " , I 'm gonna give you a fat lip , sir . Relax , Jen . Tonight I 'm just the towel boy . Rollie , listen , schedule one more media meeting for tomorrow at 14.30h. How long did they meet today ? - Goss and Rollie ? - Yes . Three hours . You are substitute commander , Shouldn 't you be present for all the meetings ? Well , I wasn 't invited . Huh , well maybe you need to talk to your wife about that . No mission goes there . That 's what you get for marrying the boss . Welcome to the agency training facility . This is mission control . 5 years earlier . The fly of Antares will be the most ambitious mission in history As astronaut candidates , you will be competing not only with yourselves , but with many of your instructors . Thats Shaw and Donner . They were the two on the Mars mission . I don 't believe that there is anyone on this program who doesn 't want to be on that crew . Your training will involve everything from flight systems to launch survivor . Make no mistakes , we are gonna challenge you physically , emotionally and intellectually . In the end , less of one third of you are gonna make it to the final year . Do you know him ? Who ? Donner . Cause he looks like he knows you . Despite what it ... - ... says on your brief sheet ... - No , he doesn 't . This will not be a soft day of orientation . - He 's smiling at you , smile back . - Jen ... - Come on , don 't be such a tight ass . - No ! Excellent . Candidate Barnes has volunteered to be on the first Centrifugation Group . Oh , no ! Whats this ? This is a bucket . Its an award . You are first one on your class to vomit . Everybody is going to get one ... or two . With five you are wash out ( eliminated ) . Wanna met with Mayor Tom ? He can give you some tips . You can not be serious . What ? I am being nice . I am being serious and I am being nice . Whats wrong with being serious and nice ? You have to lighten up , bro . So light , I am floating . - He was making a pass at you . - He 's not my type . What ? The smart , good-looking , American hero type ? - He left two people on Mars . - Okay , fine . The tragic American hero . Even better . Oh , you 're not gay , are you ? No , I 'm a geologist who wants to ... travel to another planet without unnecessary complications . Right . - A space nun . - A what ? A space nun or she 's gay . - No , she is not gay . - First-hand knows ? I don 't do astronauts , Rollie . You know that . Yeah , well , you maybe wanna reconsider . Go . What ? My place , now ! - Really ? - Mhm . We have six years screwing to do in one night ... - ... and I don 't wanna miss one minute . - Whoa , let 's ... Ah ! Woman , damn you bite hard ! The door will be unlocked . I 'll be in the bedroom . - Did she mark you again ? - Yeah . Yeah , she did . That thing it 's a German thing . Deutsch Mark . So , my mother is saying the Mercury is retrograde ... and we shouldn 't launch ... at all . Well , listen to your mother on that , definitely . I try not to . It 's hard to stop . Yeah ... I always thought out of the two of us you 'd be the one flying . So did I. Sorry ... It 's no offense . None taken . - Hey , you see cows on Venus ... - You 'll be the first to know . Zoe , a picture . Have a good time . The flight of Antares . Six years , seven planets and eight astronauts . A grand tour of the solar system . The most ambitious exploration in the history of mankind . Today is the day ! But , why mission with humans ? Why send humans who can make mistakes , when probes and robots can do the job ? This is six years mission , to seven planets . Its far too complex . Would you call the last manned mission to Mars a success ? Three of us came back . We all say yes . Despite of deserting two astronauts on planet surface ? We knew what risks were 10 years ago ... And these people know that the risks are now . Do they ? Seems to me that , aside the commender , this is very green crew . I know there this is going . Reminding you , Donner . This crew is picked for its skills and compatibility . But , clearly not its experience . I 'll say , you are fishing , Trevor . Well , then I 'll be more specific . I think we in the press were surprised when Donner and Shaw were not selected . Didn 't that surprised you guys ? They are alternates . But , why ? Does it have something to do with what happened on Mars ? Man just said that it didn 't . But thats not what I heard . Well , you hear what you want to hear . The truth will be nice for once . Cockpit recorder conveniently pixelated before the launch ... There is no public record . Why didn 't cockpit transcript ... OK , its pretty simple . We had a storm . We had to launch , so we did . But , did you have to ? Did you have to launch ? Or you panicked and blow out of there to save your own skin . Its a simple question ... C 'mon ! Whats the matter with you ? Here ! Donner , get off . What kind of stubborn cowboy are you ? Attacking British television on launch day They attacked me , Mike . And you take them back ? Its not your job to handle it , Donner . Its not your job to talk about Mars . And its definitely not your job to question my judgment . Your job is to back up Ajay , and make sure that ship is running properly . Yea , I know what my job is . Do ya ? Its not going to be your job for much longer . because as soon as I can bring someone else up to speed I 'm having you discharged from the program . Now , get out there and say goodbye to the crew . Your collection on Vid bank , all 369 hours of it ... You did ! But you have to crack the code first . Satan ! Vodka on launch day ? You have at least a 1.2 . Then ground me , Claire . Why are you letting me go . Because there is nothing to drink up there , Evram . I 'm saving your life . Wassenfelder and I thought you rocked . Well , I guess Goss didn 't . One more reason to get to see me out of sweater Goss knows that there is no way I can do this without you . You , me , that ship , we 're a three-way , Donner . - Team . - Yes . Trio . That 's ... three-way is different . We are each essential . Okay . You can not blame yourself for not being chosen for this mission . Clearly , you 're part is here on Earth . Yeah , okay . We 're okay . I 've always been one of those people who believes that you create your own destiny . And with few bad decisions , I certainly made mine . But , as much as I believe in self-determination , there are those who simply do not . Is that kind of thinking makes me nervous . Because , being an astronaut ... Its all about control . From the walk to the launch pad to the final touchdown . You don 't want surprises . 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... It 's not about fate . Is Mercury in retrograde ? - 5 ... 4 ... - It 's about planning . - We have tower seperation . - 2 ... And ignition ... And lift off . First step on Antares voyage to the planets . In space there is simply no room for error . How many of them do you think would have gone if we had told them . That 's a weak-minded question , Eve . But the answer is all of them . Every single one . Thank you , I will be able to sleep tonight . Good luck ! T minus 120 to burn . M.F.B. fine . Hydrogen go . Deuterium sequence is holding . Donner , where are you on the propulsion ? I am making progress . Do not stop the sequence . Ted , do you copy me ? Continue the sequence . Stabilizer set on 140 . Propulsor position at 797 . Oh my God , she 's out . Ted , I got Zoe out in the airlock . She is in airlock 4 . Do you copy ? How the hell did she get out ? Maddux ? Zoe , please . Don 't . Somebody get down here and stop her . Ted , do you copy ? OUTER DOOR OPEN Zoe ! What 's the status ? Off watch crew is in its courters . Eecom is working on some small vent leak . No biggie . We should go home . Get some rest . Yea . They play that every hour . We are not getting away from it , are we ? Mars is just gonna haunt us till the day we die . Headline in our obituaries . You are a Buddhist , right ? Raised as one . What you guys come down on fate ? Fate ? Yea . Predestination , the future ... And what happens if you are somehow out of control . I don 't believe that . Neither did Buddha . Its garbage , right ? Absolutely . Alright . So , this is night 1 of day 1 And we 're still in near Earth orbit . They want us to talk about anything . About how we feel . I am so proud to be the engineer on this ship . She is my path , my responsibility . This voyage with her , my karma . I am filled with all , an indescribable joy ... I know , you guys are monitoring this . I mean , you tell us its private , but seriously ? So , I 'm going to pull my pants down . I fill strange now , two weeks not sleeping with Rollie , but ... Its good for crew morale , I guess . I mean , we were in celibate for 3 months during crew orientation last year , so ... I 'm OK with it ... I guess - Hey baby . - Hey baby . Turn the camera off . And mother , if I ever let you see this ... it was a perfect launch , a flawless docking and the ship is in an incredible shape , so ... . ... so much for your horoscope . You 're pregnant ? Well , I 'm puking in the morning , I 'm puking at night , so ... You 're the biologist , tell me . This is a .. a urin sample . I got you a little . Sorry . Oh , you 're serious . You know , they used to sell tests in the drug store . Yes , I am not here for a history lesson . And if I go to my gino , the program will know . So , you are not a space nun . I 'm not now . Who is the father ? Don 't ask , won 't tell . And you did it without protection . He was drunk . He did a vasectomy . Please , don 't make me feel any more stupid . If you are pregnant , what the hell are you gonna do ? Zoe ... Are you OK ? You were just standing there . Did you just hear something ? Hear something ? Like what ? I don 't know . High pitched . Like crying . Ummm ... No . Its probably just rotator arm cricking . Right . I am sure thats what it was . Hi , students ! Welcome to Antares . Live from command bridge on Antares . This is our first broadcast from space . And I am going to give you a little tour . Anybody mind if I change the channel . At the moment we are on the fight deck . This where we control the ship . Mission commender Rollie Crane and pilot Nadia Schilling are programing the injection burn , that will send us on our way to Venice . Fight , this is surgeon . This is flight . Got a couple of weird EKG from Rollie and Ajay . They are similar , so its probably a glitch . I am gonna have them adjust their mad patches . Just advising . Fido , whats the maximum that we have left in orbit ? We need a Venice burn in 30 hours and 16 minutes . Its a pretty hard window . You seriously didn 't heard anything strange last night ? Strange ? No . It was a rotator arm . You got your story , and you stick to it , OK ? Yea . I don 't know . I haven 't been sleeping much . Weird dreams . Some things are the zero gravity and some are not . Well , our grav-suites contain nanofibers that pull us towards the deck electromagnetically . But anything without the nanotechnology , like Jen 's tomatoes ... would float . Cool , huh ? Ajay , we need to check your med-patch . Is there a problem , Evram ? I think it 's just an adjustment . Sorry Paula . Thanks for your help . Well , students ... What 's happen with that ? Rollie and Ha they have a glitch with their med-patch . We are trying to get a cleaner read . That 's not cleaning up anything , Ev . Now ? Negative . Could you relate that this is complete waste of time and I have work to do ? Why not try a couple of new ones ? Ev , try a couple of new patches might be the contact points . Copy that . Where we look at our amazing universe , and watch movies and youtube from our databank . And this is our physicist . Steven Wassenfelder . Looks like he 's doing something very complicated . Can you tell us what you 're doing , Steven ? - You probably don 't wanna know . - Oh , come on . Don 't be so condescending . Tell us . to get to the porn ... that my friend loaded into the bank for me . - And Ted ? - Sir ? And both of them have it ? I 't impossible . No , these are the new ones . We 're gonna have to do heart scan before I can clear either one of them for flight . It 's just not possible for both of them to come down with heart murmurs . It has to be an equipment error . Please , don 't encourage my mother . I 'm not following . Then you didn 't read the latest flight schedule . And Ajay and Rollie 's alternates could possibly be on it . - Hello Ted . Hello Donner . - Don 't you dare go there . The odds of this ... of two men at the same time ... Off the chart . Okay Claire , put a med team on it . Check for everything : diet , environment , viruses ... And run a detailed analysis of every crew member 's genome . We have to find out what 's causing this . I can 't clear this men for space travel . I think we got that . You 're excused . I will tell Vandenburg to get the pod ready . I want a few minutes . You don 't need more time , Mike . You know damn well what 's causing this . And they 're going . This is our mission . I am not gonna let that thing dictate anymore of the crew . - Wassenfelder were bad enough . - We don 't have a choice . - Do you think for one moment I wanna send my husband ? - Well , that makes two of us . And Donner for about a hundred reasons . And who 's to say this thing is not gonna give them heart murmurs ? Well , there are no guarantees , Mike . None . We 're in uncharted territory here . But this seems to be what it wants . Whether you wanna face it or not ... it has to say a lot more in this mission than we do . Remember last night I asked you about fate ? Told you I don 't believe in fate . I 'm a Buddhist . Yeah . I didn 't tell you something . I 'm having a dream about this mission . And ... You and I are both on it . You both are gonna need immidiate physicals . You have tonight to get your personal things in order ... and launch in the service pot tomorrow morning . Reported to medical now ? - Yes , Donner , leave us . - Roger that . This wasn 't supposed to happen . Ted , you have no idea . We need to see the new mission commander upstairs . Clean bill of health , but the pants stay off . - Sorry ? - You need your vasectomy , Donner . I don 't understand . Your sterilization . It 's painless . Yeah , actually , it 's not . I had it done when I got back from Mars . Well , yeah , um . According to your chart you did , but not according to your scan . When are you gonna tell everybody else ? In 43 days ... when you get to Venus . I always believed that this was my mission , my ship , that I was traveling on the path Ganesha wanted for me . This ... out here ... was where my problems and obstacles laid . I feel so lost now . I cannot understand this . I cannot . Who needs this path more than I ? Pap , I 'm going on a mission . It 's six years , and ... I don 't know if you 're gonna be here when I come back . You had the sweetest slider I ever saw . Fastball , change up , monster curve . You had all the tools . I wanted something else , Pap . Pour me another before you leave . Maybe I can request a replacement . I can come back on the pod . No , there is no time for that . Jen , forgive me . I want you to know that I was gonna be there with you . You 'll be there with me . Yeah . What ? For everything . Just remember how much I love you . Okay ? Show me . Let 's kill the flight deck cameras . Give the mission commander some privacy with his wife . The way I see it , they 're lucky . You can 't call an ambulance on the surface of Mars . we were eating . They 're looking in everything . Did you hear that ? What ? That . No . No . It 's the ... the rotator roam . I 'm gonna go check on Ajay . Zoe Barnes ? I am Ajay Sharma . Hi , Ajay . Hi . It 's a good thing that you won the bucket . - I am not so sure about that . - No ... Ah , I ... Somebody 's got a boyfriend . That 's vodka , drink up . Oh , no . No , you are pregnant . You 're just not gonna have a baby . Last time I looked it was the law . It 's a stupid law . - Zoe , you have more than one option here . - I don 't know . There over a thousand qualified applicants for your slot alone . I mean , getting into this program was winning the lottery . Believe me , I know . I know . Okay , so you can not give it up for a one-night-stand . I mean , you just can 't . I know a guy . He 's a doctor . When you 're ready , just give me a word . I need some air . - Zoe . Hey ... - Not now . Dude , you don 't stand a chance . Ajay ? Mission control , this is Antares . Antares , this is control . Do we have permission to put up the cameras ? You do indeed , mission control . And ... thank you for your discretion . Yeah , well , we didn 't want that to end up in Wassenfelder 's vid bank . We can 't seem to get them back up . Actually , I think Ajay is the problem . I tried to follow , but he locked me out . Dammit , he 's going for a walk . How soon can we override his instructions ? We 're working on it . Give us five minutes . If he 's in that suit , we don 't have five minutes . Where the hell is Donner ? On his way in . - What 's the time to Venus burn ? - Six hours , nine minutes . Antaris , this is control . Have you made contact ? Negative , control . Looks like his com is off . This guy tested the most stable in the entire program . Does anyone know if Hindus commit suicide . No , they don 't . At least I don 't think they do . Well , that 's not good . - He 's moving away from the ship . - Don 't do that , Ajay . Space travel is a fool 's game . Human beings are 60 percent water . We sleep , eat , defecate , can 't follow directions , and we explode like pinatas when exposed to the vacuum in space . What 's he doing . Putting himself in orbit . Oh , Ajay . Wherever he 's going , I hope he makes it . Here . I 'll go out . I can go out and get him . We wanna go out and get him . Do you copy ? Yeah , let her go . Mike , let her go . Negative . You and Shaw ship out in two hours . - That 's it ? - That 's what ? You 're just let him die ? Don 't piss me off , Donner . Not now . As soon as I get back , I quit . Arnel , how much time does he have got left in that suit . Eight hours ? Give or take . My old man is right about every single item . Except the initial premiss . Man belongs in space because of exactly what he brings into the void . No , it isn 't . But we also carry our hopes and our dreams ... the hard lessons learned from our lives . They are on 41 . Hell of a view out there , eh ? Ganesha and I have been enjoying it very much . Ganesha ? He is the Lord of obstacles . But , he is also the Lord of new beginnings . All right . You wanna hitch your ride back in and start something new ? This is my path , Donner . Right here . On the way to Venice . Correct me if I am wrong here , Ajay , but if you stay out here doesn 't that mean that you have to start all over on the next life time ? Now , I mean ... I am no expert But you are the one that was always telling me that ... each of us has a lesson to learn , and obstacles to overcome . So , maybe this is your big one , you know ? Maybe you overcome this and you take big step toward to Nirvana . You don 't understand . Wait , wait , wait ... Wait a second . You think that I don 't understand ? I think I do . My path is here on this ship , with these people . Your path is back on Earth , Ajay . But , you know what ? We can 't do it alone . You , me , the ship , we 're a three-way . We need each other . For all our false , whether were guided by our destiny , or we got them our selves , we are resilient , we can adapt . There is something I must do first . Yeah . Yes . We can find redemption in the simplest acts of humanity . I never heard of robot or a probe that was able to do that . So ... If space travel are a fools game , than ... Aaaa ... Thats what I am . So , be it . But , I never felt more alive , Or more human . Antares , you are ready for Venus , in five ... 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . Ignition ! by Dobrivoje , Siban and friends

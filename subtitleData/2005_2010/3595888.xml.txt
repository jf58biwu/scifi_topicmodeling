 This is where Sarah Jane Smith lives . And it 's home to things way beyond your imagination . There 's an extra-terrestrial super computer in the wall , a genetically engineered boy genius in the attic , a schoolgirl investigator across the road , and a whole universe of adventure right here on the doorstep . Ready ? Always . I don 't know how you do that . You 've either got it , or you haven 't Lukey-boy . You see , art isn 't something you can learn . Surely it 's a matter of bio-mechanical transference of what the eye sees to paper ? Geometry . You see , there 's your problem , you work up here , you 're all science and logic and Spocky stuff like that , but you can 't break art down into maths . Everything comes down to maths . See , not art . Art is in the soul . You don 't think it .. you feel it . Morning 11T . Someone 's in trouble . That 's Dad 's serious face . Yeah , like he 's got any other sort . All right , you lot , settle down . If I may , Mrs Taylor ? I have an important announcement to make . Told you . Concerning you , Clyde Langer . Me ? Oh , what have I done now ? Ah , no , no , don 't tell me ... I turned up . All I have to do to get some teacher 's back up . You aren 't in trouble , Clyde . For once , quite the opposite . I 've just had an e-mail , from a Mr Harding , Curator of the International Gallery . Who ? At last ! Indeed , Mr Harding . I never thought I would see the day when she came into my care . So , so beautiful . No-one else could have achieved this . The years of dedicated planning . No-one would have been man enough . We got there in the end , Miss Trupp . After all our tribulations . Yours . I only assisted . True , true . You did . And here she is ... .. the Mona Lisa ! Tomorrow morning , this entire class will be the first members of the public to see the Mona Lisa here in the UK . And all thanks to Clyde . You won first prize ! THEY CHEER You won ! Wait , wait , wait , wait , as much as I appreciate the adulation and missing double maths tomorrow - there 's been a mistake . I never put my work into any competition . Someone did . Well , I wonder who ? They were looking for a promising young artist . And you really are good . Brilliant . I knew you wouldn 't enter . Well , it 's not good for the image is it , some nerdy competition . I 've gotta text Mum . How many times ? No mobiles in the classroom . Or at the gallery tomorrow . Their rules , not mine . You 're not annoyed with me , are you ? Are you serious ? It 's the Mona Lisa ! We should press on . Yes . Oh , tomorrow will be such a day for me ! Mum ? You won 't believe what 's happened . Mum ? I 'm in your room . Look at the state of this place . Yeah , I know , but ... I thought I told you to tidy it . I will . Just listen . When ? Oh , I hate to think how long all these cups have been here . Ugh . OK . No , it isn 't . And you can forget any other plans you had for this evening because you 're blitzing this place . Don 't think K9 's zapping it . He 's out of bounds till it 's done . I am so disappointed in you . I don 't know what you want from me . You try to give me a normal life , but when I act like a real teenager you want me to be perfect , the way the Bane made me . I 'm sorry you feel like that . So am I. Hand in your mobile phones at reception and no running . No running ! We 're here as honoured guests , not like some hormonal SAS . Oh , what 's the use ? Ah freebies ! No , I 'll pass , thanks . Your loss . Anyway , what did Sarah Jane say about me winning this prize ? Nothing . We 're not really talking . She 's being such a mum . Yeah , well , it 's probably best she doesn 't know . Careful , Clyde . Even star pupils need to watch where they 're going . Sir . So , how 're you feeling ? Erm , nervous ? Weirded out . I mean teachers are never this friendly . You see , diligence has its rewards . Perhaps now you 'll put the same enthusiasm into your other school work . Mr Chandra ? Park Vale ? Yes . Mr Harding will receive you upstairs . Great . Come this way . OK , everyone follow me . It 's very exciting . I 'm very excited , as well . Actually much , much smaller than you 'd imagine . Really ? It 's very surprising because you always ... What d 'you reckon , Luke ? Who 's got the more enigmatic smile , me or Lisa ? I really don 't understand , why is the Mona Lisa so special ? It 's just brown . Maybe when you see the real thing , you 'll understand . I don 't really get art . Careful , it 's an art gallery , you 're not supposed to pick it up either , OK . You look , you don 't touch . But this isn 't art ... it 's something else . Clyde . This is Mr Harding . Curator of the gallery . Clyde Langer . We 're really proud of him . Congratulations , Clyde . You 're very talented . Such a handsome boy . Oh . This is my assistant , Miss Trupp . Now ... You really are so gifted , Clyde . Cheers . When I saw your picture , I knew you 'd win . It wasn 't up to me , but if it had been you 'd definitely have won . Well , you did ! So ... it 's all turned out for the best . Miss Trupp , perhaps you should go and check the final preparations . Oh . Yes . Big day for all of us . Clyde , follow me . Your masterpiece awaits . Come along , chop-chop , this place should be clear by now . Do you know how lucky you are ? Lionel worships you . If only he looked at me with the same eyes . Oh , quit your moaning , love ... do us all a favour . Who said that ? You can hear me ? Well , now there 's a first . So let 's try this for another . SHE SCREAMS SHE LAUGHS And here we are . In pride of place . No way . Is something wrong ? It 's just ... .. my work in a proper gallery . We told you , Clyde , it 's brilliant . CHEERING AND CHANTING Shut up ! Agreed . Some order , please . Mrs Taylor . Apart from the obvious artistic flair , your imagination is so impressive . The detail in the weaponry ! I don 't know where you get your inspiration . Please . They 're Sontaran blasters , aren 't they ? Well , spotted . That 's why you didn 't want Mum to know . Yeah , oh , and don 't tell her I 've been drawing K9 , either . You know , I always used to play this sort of stuff down . I thought people 'd laugh at me . You mean you thought drawing wasn 't cool . Something like that . Well , it is cool and believe me no-one 's laughing . When I was younger , no brothers or sisters ... I used to draw , for company . But maybe I could really do something with this . And so to the prize . Prepare to meet the Mona Lisa ! The Mona Lisa , a painting begun by Leonardo da Vinci in 1503 in Florence , but finished only shortly before he died in 1519 . For over 500 years the Mona Lisa 's beauty has remained undimmed . She has been gazed upon by millions in her Paris home , now , she is here . Feast your eyes , and lose your hearts ... I give you ... the Mona Lisa ! She has let herself go . Isn 't that his assistant ? Security . The Mona Lisa has been stolen . Excuse me , Sarah Jane , I am detecting unusual brain pattern activity and your ability to concentrate appears compromised . Are you unwell ? No . I 'm fine , Mr Smith . It 's Luke . But Luke has perfect health . That is how he was made by the Bane . Yes , I know . The perfect human being . But nothing stays perfect for ever , does it ? I am sorry . I 'm not sure that I understand . Luke isn 't ill . He 's growing up . I believe it is a normal part of breeding patterns in most species . Yes , I know . And I 've tried so hard to make Luke 's life as normal as possible . In a way it helped make mine a little more normal , too . Before I met Luke , who was I ? A lonely , frosty woman in the big house who knew more about creatures from outer-space than she did humans . I have always considered the intricacy of human nature excessively complicated in comparison to most other life forms . You and me both , old friend . And being a mum is just about as complicated as it gets . Most parents have years to get used to it . I 'm still finding my feet and already I 'm realising that one day it 's going to be over . One day Luke will be gone . One day , perhaps , very soon . I told them security had to be improved here . I told them , after that Cup of Athelstan fiasco at Easter . Oh , my beautiful Mona Lisa ! The French will have my head ! If you could all stay calm as we move out and let the police do their job . There 's something freaky about this . Just because something shady happens doesn 't mean there are aliens behind it . When my bike got nicked , did you think that was ET the ASBO , cycling home ? Did I mention aliens ? Rani 's right . Why would they put a picture of Miss Trupp in the Mona Lisa 's place ? Maybe she 's behind it all . Maybe it 's her calling card ? " The Truppmeistress has struck ! " Even if this isn 't alien , it 's weird enough for Sarah Jane . We should call her . No . We don 't need her . We can ... do this ourselves . OK , then . But first we need to lose my dad . Have you seen Jonathan , no ? Are you sure ? Excuse me , Mr Chandra . Yes , what is it , Luke ? I need the toilet . Me too , sir , I 'm busting . And me . OK . But be quick . Sir . And then straight to the coach . Nice one , Luke . What ? Good cover story . No , I really need the loo . Oh , well , like Dad says ... be quick ! I am picking up news reports from the International Gallery . The Mona Lisa has been stolen . The Mona Lisa ? I don 't believe it . The security at the International Gallery was supposed to be massive . So the reports suggest . All the same , if it hasn 't been taken by inter-galactic art thieves , it 's not really my thing . Or are you trying to distract me , Mr Smith ? I simply thought the news report would be of interest . OK . Show me . It 's understood that the theft was discovered as the Mona Lisa was about to be unveiled for a party of students from Park Vale Comprehensive in Ealing . What ? Park Vale pupil , Clyde Langer won first prize in the gallery 's Artists of the Future competition . This is Lizo Mzimba reporting from the International Gallery . Then Luke must have been there too . He never said anything . Not a word . Police ! We 'll never get past them . There has to be another way in . We need a map . Like this one ? You see , you never turn down a freebie , Luke . Luke 's not answering . The gallery prohibits the use of mobile telephones . But I have info from the Metropolitan Police computer system that you may find of interest . What exactly am I looking at ? This is a Crime Scene photograph of the Mona Lisa . Mr Smith , that isn 't the Mona Lisa . My infra-red analysis confirms the brush-stroke patterns of Leonardo da Vinci . This is the Mona Lisa . But it can 't be . Who is that woman ? Phyllis Trupp , personal assistant to the gallery 's curator . where she lists her interests as " salsa dancing . " She says she is open minded and willing to try ... Thank you , Mr Smith . What 's happened to her ? I can only surmise molecular trans-placement . She is still alive and conscious ... but trapped in the canvas of a 500 year old painting . What could have caused this ? Insufficient data . So this isn 't anything like a straight-forward art theft , is it ? It would seem not . Which means , the other question is , if that 's Phyllis Trupp ... where on earth is the Mona Lisa ? This place is like a maze ! Or like finding your way through Level Four of Alien Devastation Three . I thought you said you could find your way with that map ? Men and maps ! Hey ! I can read a map . I was in the cubs ... well until they kicked me out . But you don 't want to hear about that . Clyde . Yes , I know my picture would look great in your lounge . Just get your dad to make me an offer . I don 't want your painting , Clyde . I want to know what happened to the gun that was in it . Galaxia 's gun ! Whose ? OK , so I gave them names . Can we move on now ? What matters is ... What are you doing here ? The police are conducting an investigation . they don 't need a bunch of schoolchildren roaming around , disturbing evidence . Well , it isn 't just your Mona Lisa that 's been stolen now , is it ? One of the guns in Clyde 's painting has vanished . Look . It 's dry . The gun wasn 't painted out , Mr Harding . It was taken . Whatever we 're dealing with it 's more than just an art thief . Oh , you better believe it , sugar . She 's got my gun ! She went to the toilet and that 's the last I saw of her . No , Gita , the police won 't let me back in . No , I can 't ring her . No phones allowed inside . Look , I 'll call you back . Haresh , hello . Sarah Jane . I suppose you know about the Mona Lisa ? Of course . The crime of the century and story of the year . Where 's Luke ? The thing is they 've closed the gallery and Luke , Rani and Clyde are still inside so ... Why don 't you look after the rest of the kids , and I 'll see what I can do . In my line of work you get a knack for opening closed doors . You sure ? Mmm . Thank you . Mrs Taylor , kids , come on . Quickly . Move . Phones away . Are you chewing ? Put your phones away please . Thank you . OK . Come on . Who are you ? And I thought you were supposed to be an art expert ! I am the Mona Lisa . No , but really ? Yeah , really . You can 't fake this kinda class . You can 't be the Mona Lisa , you have to be some sort of alien manifestation . Whoooh . And why 's that , then ? Because , on Earth , women in paintings don 't just jump out of their frames . And nick guns from someone 's painting . Do you know how long that took me to paint ? SHE SHIVERS Not bad . Not in my league , of course . But then Leo was a bit of a ledge even back then . Although he had to blag the oils off his weirdo neighbour to paint me . OK . Say that 's true . Now you 're out of your frame , what is it you want ? I 've just had five centuries hanging on a wall , sugar . What is it you think I want ? It 's time I had a bit of fun . And I think I 'll start with some target practice . Run for it ! So it 's just you and me now , Harders . Sonic Scarlet , my favourite shade . Oh , boy . That 's it ... now I have seen everything . We so have to get hold of Sarah Jane . And I mean now . No . What 's got in to you ? Why are you being so weird about your mum ? Luke and Sarah Jane have had a barney ... . Rani . Never mind that . Where is everyone ? On the coach . My dad 'll be going mental by now . What about the police . Forensics should be crawling all over this place . Something 's wrong . It is . So very , very wrong . A whole new kind of wrong . Mia Bella ! Is it ... is it really you ? Oh , go on then , touch me . I know you want to . I 've seen the way you look at me . I remember when you came to the Louvre . The Louvre ? Actually , every time you came . Twenty seconds , that 's all anyone gets to see me and then , move along s 'il vous plait . You always put up quite a struggle . It 's a shame they had to ban you in the end . It is you ! It really is you ! And you are going to have to get used to that because we 've got a lot of work to do . I don 't understand . We have to find my brother . Definite traces of alien energy . Two of them . He 's here somewhere ... I know he is . But there 's nothing to suggest in any academic work that you had a brother . Not had , Harders , have . And he 's here somewhere amongst this tat just waiting for me . You mean another painting . Yes , I can see how you got the job here , Harders . And that 's why I need you . You know every brush stroke in this place . Well , what does he look like , your brother ? I 've never seen him so I haven 't got a clue . But he 'll have been painted around the same time as me , the same place as me . Next door , in fact . I 've got it ! Follow me ! Oh , it 's locked . We have to find a phone . I don 't care what you say , Luke , what 's happened to those people is beyond freaky . We 're calling your mum . I don 't think there 's any need . Her car 's here . Residual alien energy . But if this is , or was , a painting by Leonardo , how is that possible ? Do you know , Phyllis ? I know you can hear me , even though you can 't answer . I promise you , I 'm going to get you out of there . If he was painted at the same time as you , his has to be him . Has to be . Not only a contemporary of Leonardo , but a neighbour in Florence . Him ? He 's not much of a looker , is he ? Giuseppe Di Cattivo . 1450 to 1518 , whose work is often compared to his more famous contemporary Hieronymus Bosch . Poor Giuseppe he died in a lunatic asylum . No ... no , this isn 't him . But ... Come out , come out , whoever you are ! I can hear you breathing ! Who would 've thought a painting would have such good hearing , Mona Lisa ? But then Leonardo was such a stickler for detail . On the subject of detail ... mind filling in the obvious blank ? My name is Sarah Jane Smith . And that is a Sontaran blaster , do you mind telling me where you got it ? Oooh , I just took it from the painting that lad Clyde did , cos I thought it looked a little bit flash . Oh , Clyde . You 'd better not have harmed him or his friends ! Oh , no , don 't concern yourself . They 're perfectly safe . I 'm Lionel Harding curator of the museum . Mr Harding , whatever is happening here , don 't worry . I can help you . Thank you , I 'm not sure I need it . Ah , you see Harders here , he 's my number one fan . Listen to me , she is dangerous . Look what she did to Miss Trupp . Now you don 't want to worry about that old trout do you Harders ? I mean , you never did before , did you ? And , let 's face it , she never was an oil painting . At least not till now ! Release her . Now ! Oooh , I might think about it . Depends if you stay out of my way . Sarah Jane Smith ? Sarah Jane , where do I know that name ? Oh ! oohh that Sarah Jane . Seems like no-one wants you around , Sazza . Not even your son . What ? Hmmm , heard him talking before ... he 'd like you to keep your nose out . And so would I. I 'm sorry , whatever you 're planning I am not stepping aside . That 's your choice . No , Mia Bella ! DEEP GROWLING What is that ? That is my brother . Is it me , or did things just get uncomfortable ? What 's going on ? Well , give me a second , and I 'll put you in the picture . No . That 's Mum ! Sarah Jane ? Mum ? Luke ? I 've found her . No , Mum ! EVIL LAUGHING And that is how she 'll stay ... .. forever ! Run ! I have not been released from wood and paint to be trapped in here . A legend , a painting too terrifying to be exhibited . Once we are united your reign of fire and sulphur shall begin and the world will be a rage of flames at our feet .

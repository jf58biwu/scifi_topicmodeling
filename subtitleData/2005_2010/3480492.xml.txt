 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * - One night . - * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Actually , he 's my , uh , biological padre . So ... what 's the plan ? Plan is to keep you safe . I was exposed ... so that free pass I had for you went away . But even danko 's reach doesn 't extend south of the border . Yet . And what about everyone else ? I 'll make some calls . Put some things in motion . All right , well ... we also gotta eat . There 's a cantina down the way . Can I buy you a taco ? With , uh , what money ? I 'll think of something . Think I 'm just gonna go for a walk . Now , look , it 's probably best that we stick together.Okay ? It 's for your own safety . I 'll be careful.I promise . All right , look , I 'll meet you at the cantina , okay ? Don 't be- - * * * * * * * * Think we 're clear . My very own guardian angel . * * * * You 're a good son , peter . That 's not why I saved you.I want answers . And you think I 've got them ? You always know more than you let on . I 'm sorry to disappoint you , but I need to find some answers for myself right now . That 's why I had you bring me here . This is where I 'm supposed to be . * * * * * * * *  So , tell me exactly what happened . We were moving in to apprehend this guy . Agents whitman , price , and holiday went in , I watched the hallway . And I heard three gunshots . I ran in as fast as I could and I found them . Like this . And you didn 't see anyone ? No , sir . Nothing.I ... I 'm sorry , sir . Go back to H.Q.Get cleaned up . What are you thinking ? No sign of a scuffle.One bullet each in the back . Who was their intended target ? James martin.32 High school geometry teacher . Amateur fly fisher . Bio doesn 't exactly read " trained assassin . " What 's martin 's ability ? Unknown . His dna was in the national database . Set off a red flag . We 're doin ' that now . You gonna lecture me about civil liberties ? No . About sending your men in blind . Unknown means martin could be anything . He could be a telepath , a teleporter , an invisible man . Each one requires a different tactic . Our orders are to take them all in . You 're so desperate to chalk up a win , you 're cutting corners- - is that it ? Let 's not forget you 're nathan petrelli 's boy . And the last crusade was to catch this rebel , and you didn 't catch him , did you ? You need a win a hell of a lot more than I do . * As I walk along I wonder what went wrong with our love , * * a love that was so strong * I love this song . Well , quite a bloodbath in there , isn 't it ? Did you get my gifts ? Taxidermied bunny and the near-dead puppeteer ... you shouldn 't have . It was an overture toward collaboration , since we both want the same thing . And what 's that again ? Killing people like me . I think we should pool our resources . What 's in it for you ? Let 's just say you fascinate me . And you 're in way over your head in there . I can help you ... if you want . I can find the guy who killed your agents . * I 'm-a walking in the rain * * tears are falling , and I feel the pain * Heroes Season3 Episode21 I want eyes on every road , every terminal , air , bus , roadblocks . This isn 't a drill , people . Three of our own died . And they will not die in vain . Not on my watch . Not on yours . So remember your training . Remember agents whitman , price , and holiday and their families . Remember , we don 't sleep ... until this son of a bitch is caught . Any questions ? Nice speech . We need a win . You have 20 years ' experience with these people , and I need a plan .   And I don 't wanna hear , " one of us , one of them . " Then I won 't say it . But it got the job done . The very same tactics that you used on all those counter-insurgency programs you ran from havana to kabul . I don 't know what you 're talking about . - No . - Right . Well , if you did know what I was talking about , then you 'd probably understand the value of co-opting the native population . Working the enemy . A little focused manipulation goes a long way . How could you work with these people ? Trust them ? Who said anything about trust ? They 're assets- - weapons to be mobilized . Motivate them . Greed , revenge , love , hate- - whatever it takes to make the collar . Speaking of which ... I have reason to believe that sylar is here ... in D.C. This could be the win that we both need . Or it could be another chapter in the big book of you letting him slip through your fingers . No.I , uh ... got another assignment for you . Voila . Where 'd you get that ? I sold my kidney . Actually , both of them.Twice. I found a pawn shop down the street . Sold the necklace my dad gave me . My other dad . You didn 't have to do that . I didn 't want to , but he 's mr.Survival skills , and if he knew we were in a pinch and didn 't sell it , he 'd be mad . I expect he would.It 's a nice gesture , but I got everything under control . This isn 't exactly a simple situation here . It seems simple to me . Government agents are out there hunting innocent people , and they 're gonna keep going until you tell them to stop what you started . Would it kill you to show me just a little bit of gratitude ? For what ? For--for giving you a free pass . For risking my neck to save your life when it was over . Pick one--either one . Just common courtesy , claire . Why did you give me a free pass ? I had my reasons . Be back . What are you gonna do with it ? Turn it into more . Gentlemen . Is that tequila ? The mass is ended . May you go forth in peace and love and serve the lord . You think sanctuary 's gonna stop the agents from coming ? I can 't sleep , peter . To find where we should go , what we should do , I need to dream , and to dream I need to sleep , and I can 'T . I haven 'T . Not for a long time . Take a pill . Doesn 't work . For the dreams to come , ones that matter , sleep has to be natural , has to be earned . Earned . I always found peace here . Your father and I were married in this church . We walked down this aisle . Your first communion ... even nana 's funeral . You 're probably too young to remember , but you held my hand . There used to be love in this family once . Look at us now . It 's all my fault . You come here to be forgiven ? I 'm not sure even god has that in him . You boys wanna make this a little more interesting ? What 'd you have in mind ? Listen . - Come on , let 's go . - $ 100 a hit . Last man standing takes all . Listen , I can do this . I used to do this scraping for shore leave money in the philippines , all right ? I 'm good at it . - Fine . - All right . Go for it . All right , boys . Line ' em up . - Jenkins . - Sir . I wanted to check in.See if there was anything else I could do . No . Just try to get some rest . I wanted to tell you that what you said earlier about the guys ... It was inspirational . I wish I had your strength . Hello . Special delivery . How the hell did you get in here ? Well , you 'd be amazed what you can do with a lifted I.D.Badge , a $ 4 tie , and a west baltimore accent . But you 've got much bigger problems . Done some homework about that killer of yours . I don 't need your help . Well , I just found some evidence to the contrary . There 's another body.He stashed it , you missed it . I found it , of course . You 're lying . Look in the box . What 's in the box ? Your answer . How james martin was able to shoot your men in the back so easily . It 's because of what he can do . He 's a shape-shifter . Come on . Where is he ? Just around the northeast corner . 'Scuse me . Hey--hey , I didn 't do anything . Take him in . Your coat 's sopping wet . Found this one in the bins.It looked like something you 'd wear . Well , it should.It 's mine . I made a donation last week . It 's supposed to go to someone who needs it . Didn 't know you were still so active . I give them things . Not devotion , not myself . Not the same . It 's like with you and your brother . Your father and I supported you , but we didn 't give you support . Sure , you did . Oh , peter . There were times when you were growing up , you were so confused . You were so desperate for answers , and I could have told you the truth . I could have given you comfort . I didn 'T . You must hate me . I 'm gonna find you a cup of tea . It 'll help you sleep .   I don 't hate you . Look , whatever 's happened , you 're still my mother . I 'm afraid that unconditional love isn 't really love at all . Hey , why don 't we just call it a draw ? You guys don 't look so good . - Nonsense . - You don 't have to do this , you know . Yeah , I do . We need the money , don 't we ? Besides , your dad 's not the only one who can ... your other dad ... he 's not the only one who can do stuff , you know . You better get your old man off to bed . You need a rematch , huh ? How ' bout a rematch ? Uh-uh , no , man.I beat him fair and square . Come on , what about ... winning a little bit more ? What do you have in mind ? What about this watch ? It 's a pretty nice watch , huh ? It 's a really nice watch , but ... I 'm like ... 22 shots deep . You 're a little bit late for the party . Then I 'd better catch up , huh ? You 're not the only one who can get the drop on someone . Oh , you 've been waiting here for me . Your M.O. ' S predictable enough . You desperately wanna find martin so you can get that ability , don 't you ? I have plenty of powers . But this is different . Shape-shifting . You 're salivating . I read your profile . How you like to take on accents , affectations . Play characters . - It 's fun . - It 's sad ... you 're so desperate to be someone else . You want out . You have no idea what I want . Shape-shifting . It 's your escape hatch . 'Course , I could save you the trouble ... end it all for you , right now . The part of my brain that you 'd need to hit to kill me ... is microscopic . I 'm a pretty good shot . It 's not that simple . I also gotta jam something in there , right ? To make it stick . You 've clearly thought all of this through , haven 't you , except for the part where you can 't catch your guy without my help . You 're all the win I need . The white whale . Maybe ... I 'm the goose who lays the golden egg . I can round them all up . You suggesting that I can 't ? You chased a shape-shifter . You don 't chase ... a shape-shifter . Just one ... photo on that board ... just one ... and I could help you find them all . Then you can take your shot . I asked to be extraordinary . And I promised to make the world a better place . So when I got my chance , I lived up to my end of the bargain . For what ? I 'm running for my life . A lot of people are running for their lives . They 're hurt and they 're dying , and I can 'T ... help them . Do you even care what you put people through ? I mean , when I kneel here before you and I ask for help , do you even listen ? And I 'm tired of fighting . And I 'm angry . I 'm angry at my father , nathan ... and my mother . At you . We had a deal . I think it 's about time you lived up to your end . Please , just ... show up . I want the perimeter locked down . Excuse me ... what do you people think you 're doing ? Sit down , sir . Sir , we have reason to believe the church is harboring two fugitives . Chain the doors.No one gets in or out , you understand ? Yes , sir . This is a waste of time . Martin 's halfway across the country by now . No , he 's not . He hasn 't left the city . He had his chance , and he didn 't take it . He showed up as agent jenkins right under your nose . Yeah , why would he do that ? Martin 's only human . We all crave routine We just need to find his . You got some special power for that ? I do . But I don 't need it . You can tell everything about a person from their belongings . I thought you 'd be better at this . Why 's that ? 'Cause you 're a shape-shifter too . I 've been to your apartment- - you 've got no books , no art , no keepsakes , no correspondence.Nothing to define you . This is the part where you get under my skin . - I 've seen your file too . - Must be very hollow and boring . Not like martin 's closet . I 've never seen so many costumes . Not much call for a geometry teacher to wear an armani suit . Or scrubs ... or this . It 's fractured . Disjointed .  He 's trying on personalities like clothes . - Has he made a choice ? - Not yet . Like all of us , he 's still looking . What 's the common denominator here ? Lawyer , doctor , priest ? Power . These roles give martin something he could never find in real life . - Why ? - Why does anybody want power ? To screw with people ... or to simply screw people . Here . Tell me what you notice about all those pictures . Martin isn 't in any of them . Or these are all ... martin . Different men of power with different women of allure . It 's a cliche for a reason , and it 's marvin 's routine . Where is he ? Where he goes every night ... lookin ' to fall in love . what do you weigh , like a buck ten ? That 's none of your business . Well , I 'm just sayin ' , man.You just don 't even look drunk . I think that you 're just jealous that I caught up . Yeah . After I put your old man to sleep . Oh , please.That 's not hard . He tends to bite off more than he can chew . He 's pretty slick , but he seems like a good guy . He wants to be . Free passes and ... swooping in and ... - taking me off to mexico , thinking that 's all he has to- - I get it . My parents are divorced too . No.It 's not like that . Maybe it is . I just wish he would take off his armor , shining or otherwise , and just act like a normal human being . Thank you ! We need to go . Hey , come on . We gotta go . I won the money . Right there , that door . All right , I 'll get it . You got it ? I 'm checking every one . I 'm sorry , peter . Mom , you need to be quiet . No.This may be our last chance together , and there are things I have to say- - You don 't have to say anything--it 's okay . Listen to me ! I was just like you . My head in the clouds , full of hope . I was gonna be a teacher . And then my power manifested , and the dreams came . Visions of a bloody future of deceit and death- - the apocalypse . And when I woke ... I tried to warn everyone , but no one would listen . Why would they ? Why should they ? I was cassandra screaming that the sky was falling , but when they looked up , there was no cloud in sight . And I did it with lies ... and with manipulation ... and betrayal . And it cost me everything- - my friends , my husband , my boys . Mom . But peter ... it 's the price I chose to pay to save the world . All clear . You heard him.Back up . Guess who 's here ? Where ? Which one ? I suppose that fits the pattern- - a position of power , authority , significance . I think you 'll recognize him . what happened last time you chased him . What 's he up to ? Why me ? He 's after power . He thinks that 's something you have . He 's trying to convert the power into love . He 's doing a pretty good job of it too . He 's a better you than you . Where 'd he go ? Okay . You should ... never , ever ... fly in that condition ... again How are you not ... Ah , the whole tissue regeneration thing- - I think it includes my liver tissue . Oh , yeah ? I didn 't know that . I 'm so sorry , claire . Let me ... help . I really messed up . It 's all right.It 's fine . It 's not fine . You know what I did when I found out about you ? I did what I always do . I denied there was a problem , just like I 'm doing right now . You know , we should probably ... have this conversation in the morning . The truth is , claire , I get a pit in my stomach every time I think of you . It was just so stupid the way I handled it . You know , I thought if I ... kept my distance ... when the time was right , we would ... catch up . But look at you . I missed my chance.You 're all grown up . Hardly . You wanna know why I gave you a free pass ? Because I thought in one move , I could win you over . Look , right now I 'm using you as an excuse to hide behind this mess that I 'm- - you know what ? I know everybody 's counting on me to fix it . And I wanna try . I 'm gonna do it for everybody . Peter ... my mom ... For you . I 'm gonna fix it all . I 'll make it all ... I lost him . Me too . I guess he 's gone . For good this time . Let 's go . You killed him . No . He 's still alive . Wait . Can you do it without leaving ... Good morning . Morning . Ou really bailed me out with those kids last night . I appreciate it . That 's what family 's for , right ? So what 's the plan ? Are we going straight to washington ? No . Look , I-I didn 't make any calls to anybody . I don 't really have any friends on the hill at the moment . But last night , you said that you would fix everything . I was drunk . I 'm sorry if I got your hopes up . There 's gotta be something that you can do . I 'm wide open if you got any ideas . Claire , I overreached .   I screwed up ... and now it 's just way beyond my control . Some things are bigger ... than one man . You know what ? Over the years ... I couldn 't help but ... think about my real dad ... who you were , what you looked like , your job ... and then I met you . And you were more amazing than anything I could have ever imagined . It 's just a fantasy . No ! No , it doesn 't have to be ! You can do anything you want . You can fly ! Claire . You 're supposed to be superman . Feeling better ? I slept ... and I had a dream . What about ? That . Or should I say " her " ? I know what we have to do now . First ... we need to go find nathan and claire , and we need to bring this family together . And then we need to go visit my sister . Sister ? So where they headed anyway ? There 's a quarter past ocho to san diego . What time is it ? I got nothin ' . What happened to your watch ? I 'm heading back up , you know . Good . Comin ' ? You okay , sir ? Those things 'll kill ya . So how did that feel ... zipping up that body bag ? Cathartic . Poetic . And tactically fortunate . I 'll be a lot easier for us to operate ... if everybody thinks I 'm dead . If we do this ... we succeed ... you 'd be the only one left . Funny how that works . * * * * * * * * *

 In the future , A computer program called skynet , will declare war on the human race . Machines have traveled back in time , Taking human form to terminate john connor , The future leader of the resistance ; Sarah connor , john 's mother , teacher , and protector . Cameron , a terminator reprogrammed To defend them at all costs . Derek reese , john 's uncle , And the commanding officer with the resistance . Together they fight to stop skynet From ever being created . The battle for our tomorrow starts today . Previously on terminated The sarah connor chronicles ... Whatever happened with the explosion flipped a switch . You don 't know what you 're about to do . You 're gonna kill me . I love you , please . I love you , john , and you love me . Maybe you could fix her , but I can 't let you . I 'm sorry . I 'm looking for the connors . Sarah connor ? Mr. dixon wanted to marry sarah connor before you . Maybe he 's hiding her here . If one of them follows you here , You 'll have killed us . You died two years ago . It was cancer. you died . Did you sleep ? What do you do with a guard dog you can 't trust ? What , that one ? I 'd have spent the night talking to him . Yeah , I think she 's outside his jurisdiction . Just a wire knocked loose , Or something . So he says . Bitch is nothing but wire . It 's only a matter of time . It 's healing quickly . Quicker than yours . What about the rest of you ? You 're back to normal ? Things have changed , john . What things ? You can 't be trusted anymore . Me ? I can 't be trusted anymore ? You risked your life to fix me . That was a very dangerous thing to do . That could upset people . They 'll have to deal with it . Not them . What did she say ? Nothing . You should go to school . I 'll start on a new place . School ? Really ? You always talk about how english is so boring . I think we could all use boring today , Especially you . What about her ? Last thing she is is boring . I 'll keep her with us . So , um , you 've been sitting in the same exact spot Since you bailed out on english . I figure it must have some kind of redeeming value . You 're in mr. hendrickson 's class , right ? Um , it 's mr. amidon 's class , weirdo . And , yeah , I 'm third row , second from the left . Right . And your name is ? It 's riley . Way to flatter a girl . Look , riley , I really , uh- - I don 't mean to be rude . Oh , wait , let me guess , You are just way too busy for company right now . Obviously . Don 't you have somewhere to be ? Don 't you ? Hey , um , you got 20 bucks ? Yeah. why ? I 'm still hungry . There 's three bedrooms . Four if you count the nursery , and why wouldn 't you ? This one here 's the master suite . I 'll check the electric . So you live next door ? mm-hmm . Where 'd the owners go ? Oh , they 're in tokyo for a year . Bob 's a last-minute fill-in for his boss . Guy stroked out three days before he was supposed to leave . Don 't feel bad . I met the guy once , and he grabbed my ass With his wife five feet away . Not this ass , of course . Eh , you- - Car accident. oh . The whole family . Teaching that one to drive . You 're kidding me . I don 't kid about teenagers . I can 't even imagine . How many months are you ? Seven . I feel like a whale . You look great . I 'm an orca with boobs . There are worse things to be . Do you want to feel it ? It 's cool . Everyone does . It 's crazy , right ? Once upon a time , you were inside her . We can move in today . Oh , yeah , as soon as I figure out what to do With all this stuff . We 'll take it , all of it . Mrs. dixon . I 'm james ellison , fbi . May I come in ? I 'm not here as an fbi agent . I 'm here to help you . I found it in a drawer This morning after he went to work . Charlie hates guns . mich , I 'm home . What 's going on here ? We need to talk . Help ! Check the perimeter . Come on , help . Greenway . What ? what ? What are you trying to say ? who ? stop greenway . Who 's greenway ? stop- - Who 's greenway ? hey. serrano point . The power plant , serrano point . Two days. two days what ? Wait , hey ! No , no , no . He 's from the future . Sent here by john . I assume that 's how he found us . You sure that 's not broken ? I 'm sure I don 't care . You heard the guy . Serrano point , two days , st greenway . I 'll handle it . I 've seen how you handle it . I send you and a land mine to do this , I guarantee someone 's ending up dead . Maybe somebody 's supposed to end up dead . And the other part of that equation is maybe not . Are you coming ? It looks a lot different than I remember . in the future , The resistance controls this plant ? The battle of avila beach . December 8 , 2026 . Humans regain control of serrano point from skynet . It 's a key strategic hold . It 's one of our main sources of power . The guy who died said something about two days . What 's happening in two days ? Maybe greenway will tell us . Maybe greenway 's trying to sabotage the plant . You think he 'll tell us that ? I think he will . All right . Okay . Nuclear power plants supply 20 % of the nation 's electricity . But how do they work ? These lovely ladies are uranium fuel rods . And they are hot . We 're gonna start a chain reaction . aww , nuts . Hot rods make the water boil . The steam spins turbines , And abracadabra , energy . Of course we can 't forget To cool the steam back to water So the whole process can be repeated . Or else we 'll have a massive compromise Of the containment system . You know , I don 't like taking on new temps , I will tell you . Still , perfect score on your placement exam . Security clearance . And I did have two janitors call in With some personal emergencies , so ... Come on . Is there a reason you two are so rough around the edges ? Car accident . 'cause I can 't have any problems in my plant . Car accident . Just stay out of the fuel building Without your protective gear on . Or you could get crapped up . That doesn 't sound very pleasant . It 's plant talk For getting exposed to radiation . Then you 'd need a scrub down . You don 't want a scrub down . Target Identified : Carl Greenway sarah 's alive ? In l.a. ? And these things , They 're not human ? I can 't- - I can 't- - I don 't love her anymore , babe . Not like that . Of all the things you just told me , charley , She seems to be the least of our problems . You two need to leave this place . It 's not safe here anymore . Where is ? Saint bibiana . Saint who ? Saint bibiana . It 's the school that I went to until ninth grade . Well , ninth and a half , technically . 'cause I got the boot for this . Can you believe it ? So what 's your story ? You look a little- - Oh , it 's just a car accident . I was teaching my sister how to drive . Did everyone check out ? Check out ? Is everyone okay ? Oh , yeah , we 're fine . We 're good . We 're alive . For now . You 're full of carrots and apples . Carrots and apples ? Yeah , carrots and apples . You know , happy thoughts . I don 't think that 's really an expression . It 's not ? I don 't know , maybe if you 're on a farm . We 're moving . My mom found us a new place this morning . Is it nice ? I don 't know . I haven 't seen it . Are you serious ? She hasn 't , like , Shown you any pictures or anything ? She 's not really the picture type . Yeah , I totally know that type . So you wanna come see it ? What , the mystery house ? Yeah , the mystery house . Do you wanna come with me and see it ? Check the cooling pump calibration On the p.w.r. board . It was fine yesterday . We 're less than 36 hours from going online . Check it again . I 'd have a headache too if I had to figure out What all those buttons do. they 're just vitamins . I 'm karen , by the way . Carl. you 're new ? Brand spanking . Just moved here from texas . Really ? whereabouts ? A little town called elgin . Near corpus christi . I was stationed at ingleside naval base . Oh , imagine that . Neighbors and never even knew it . I hear there 's a big st t tomrow . The reactor 's going back online ? Exactly how 's that work ? Hopefully perfectly . Greenway . A word . Nice meeting you , karen . Likewise . There 's cautious , and there 's just plain paranoid , Okay ? We 're going online . Sure as hell not gonna let you stall us . Well , I guess this is it . Sweet . What 's the matter ? Never brought a girl home before ? No . Well , I wonder where your room is . I don 't know . Well , let 's go look for it . She can 't be serious . One more , please . I 'll have what he 's having . I 'm drinking tonic water . I won 't have what he 's having . I waitressed for years . On our break , the other girls would smoke And I would , um- - Play with matches . Study for my computer classes . See how far it got me . So what 's your story , carl ? How do you end up at serrano point ? Started off in the navy . Served 12 years on a nuclear sub . Every girl loves a uniform . My ex didn 't . At least not the one with my name stitched to it . Bitch . Affirmative . That 's a good scar . Got a good story to go with it ? I don 't know about good , but it 's a story . Hi . I 'm cindy . I 'm new in town . This looks like fun . Well , cindy , this may look like fun , But bob here 's Got 50 bucks says he can beat anyone in this bar . Ain 't that right , bob ? I 'll play you , bob . You ever played this game before ? How hard could it be ? Oh , it 's plenty hard , girl . Let me show you . Now , what you 're gonna do Is take this stick and lean over the table . Now slide it through your fingers . Relax , and get a real good feel . That 's right . Nice and easy . Still my shot . Right , bob ? So the first surgery , they went in , Took out most o9 the lymph nodes . Then they went back in four months ago And cleaned out the rest . Luckily , they were able to go through the same incision . You don 't hear many people with cancer Use the word " luckily . " Oh , you 'd be surprised . After four rounds of chemo , You say a lot of things you never thought you would . Most of them I won 't repeat . Mm . Now I 've gone and spooked you . No . Yeah . It 's okay . You wouldn 't be the only one . In a nuke plant , a guy with cancer Is sort of a black cat . Funny thing is 20 years around nuclear reactors , I haven 't been crapped up , not once . Lucky . See , lucky . There you go . You seem like a good guy , carl . If no one will drink with you ' cause you 're sick , Then it 's their loss . That isn 't why they won 't drink with me . Somebody just smashed greenway 's windshield . Big guy with a crew cut . Well , greenway 's got a lot of enemies . He stopped the last reactor test because of safety concerns . If he stops the test tomorrow , People are afraid the plant will get shut down And they 'll lose their jobs . He 's concerned about One of the sensor boards in the control room . It 's showing slight irregularities In the coolant pumps . I hacked into the computer and read his notes . Anyway , his boss is pressuring him To ignore it , says it 's nothing major . But if greenway 's , right , and there was a problem- - The reactor could melt down . Half the state would be contaminated . Skynet wins . But if greenway stops the test And they close down the plant ... Then the resistance can 't use it in the future . Skynet wins . Wow , they didn 't even leave any pickles . Check the freezer . Oh , my god , you 're a genius . How did you know ? What 's wrong ? It 's my mom . Is that a problem ? John ? Who are you ? This is riley . From school . Hi , mom . Let 's talk , you and i . Riley from school . You never mentioned her before . Well , that 's because I just met her today . Really ? Now is not the time for this . Now is not the time . Well , when is the time ? For me , I mean , To live my life . Hey , if- - If you guys are gonna keep fighting about me , I can leave . No . Everything 's fine . Do you think about the future much ? The future . When you 're out of your house , Away from your family . You know , freedom . Yeah , I think about the future a lot . I don 't know about freedom though . Parents are freaks . Yours too ? Look at the stars . What are you doing in here ? This is a restricted area . I 'm looking for the supply room . One of the lifts in the waste barrel area Leak hydraulic fluid . You might as well take care of it since you 're here . Suit up . It can get nasty in there . What is that ? what does that mean ? I means you just got crapped up . Morning . Did you sleep on the floor ? Early riser . What 's that ? What 's it look like ? Looks like a robot . It 's a robot , big scary man , Whatever . He 's for you . To protect you while you sleep . What , do I look like I need protection ? If you don 't want it then- - No , no . It 's very cool . Thank you . You 're very welcome . So I guess I 'm gonna try to make it to english . What about you ? Maybe ... not today . Can I call you sometime ? This is gonna sound really weird , But whenever you call me the first words Out of your mouth need to be the date . Day first , then the month , okay ? And I 'm doing this because ? Because you want to call me , And that 's just the way it is . See you later then . These are my same clothes . Aren 't they crapped up ? You know , it turns out they 're not . Positive reading must have been a hiccup . A hiccup ? Yeah , sometimes these scanners have a mind of their own . Agent ellison . Wanted to make sure you got off all right . Well , all right 's pretty relative , isn 't it ? How 's she doing ? Well , you know , we always thought we 'd raise kids in this house . But you just can 't plan for anything now , can you ? For the road . So what about you , are you gonna leave ? Or does god have a plan for you ? We 'll see . Yeah , we 'll see . Thank you . Good luck . T minus two minutes . Coolant system numbers are within tolerances . Of course they are . Everything is fine . But yesterday you said- - everything is fine . 16 november . 20 : 07 .

And we 're online . Greenway , he 's been replaced by a machine . Did you hear me ? Greenway has control of the plant , and he 's a machine . Hey ! You alive in there ? I 'm thinking about what to do . Since when did you do that ? What 's going on ? Turbine building . Water valve 's sprung a leak . Go fix it . Where the hell did you go ? Something 's wrong . We need to turn on the water pumps . We gotta cool it down . Everything is fine . Carl , the reactor 's overheating . It 's going to melt down . Please remain calm . You need to talk to greenway . He 's lost his mind . What the- - code red . All employees must evacuate immediately . He 's unconscious . The reactor 's overheating . Emergency manual . There 's no way . Water tank leak . No , there 's no time. we gotta go . I found the instructions . Sarah , come on now ! Let 's go ! no , no , no . This is some kind of schematic . Nrc emergency . Security code , please . I 'm in the control room. we need help . Sir , I need a secuty code . This is an emergency. we don 't know what we 're doing . Sir , I 'm sorry but- - sarah ! Sir ? hello ? sarah ! Hold it . Stop right there . Are you okay ? Are you okay ? I 'm okay . You 're clean . When we jumped through time , you told me I died of cancer . Yes , 2005 . Am I still gonna get sick ? I don 't know . Is today how it happens ? I don 't know . What am I supposed to do , just wait ? Like a time bomb , am I just gonna go off someday ? I don 't know . Am i ? You have a new friend . Her name is riley . And you probably creeped her out . When you talk to people , don 't stand so close . I was assessing her threat level . Well ? Am I safe ? I don 't know . Girls are complicated . About what you said before , about not being able to trust me . Yes ? I don 't have to prove anything to anyone . Anyone . Including you . 16 november . Hey , you got it right. what 's up ? Just practicing . Because of this tragic incident , The owners of serrano point and six other power plants across the Nation are entering into a partnership with my corporation , automatic systems . New automated technology we 've developed Will be implemented in all control rooms . These sophisticated machines will eliminate the Possibility of human error and prevent a major disaster .

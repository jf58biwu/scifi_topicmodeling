We 'll come back down here , bring something with us to destroy it . I 'm gonna be sick . [ GRUNTING ] What 's wrong with her ? - I don 't know . She 's burning up . - I 'm fine . Is she pregnant ? Why in the hell would you even ask that ? Kacy vomited when she was pregnant . You 're vomiting . It 's morning . - That 's when it happens . - Shut up . SARAH : It 's a bug or something . [ RETCHING ] Stomach flu or something . We 'll be home soon , okay ? Here . Wait . [ FOOTSTEPS ] How are you feeling ? How do I look ? Like crap . I wish I felt that good . - What 's that ? - It 's rehydration fluid . Drink one cup every half hour or right after you vomit . No , no , no . Where you going ? - We have to go back now . JOHN : Back where ? Mexico . There 's thermite in the garage . We need to burn Cromartie 's body . He 's dead . You destroyed his chip . You have to incinerate him . It 's the only way . He 's in a hole in the middle of the desert . His chip is obliterated . - I think we 're pretty- - CAMERON : Safe ? It 's not safe . Oh , God , she 's starting to sound like you . She 's right . [ CELL PHONE RINGING ] - Hey . JESSE [ OVER PHONE ] : Hey . I need to see you . Now . Bring a gun . DEREK : Jess ? Hey . I was at the mall this morning , right ? And I just- - I can 't stop eating the crappy Chinese food in the food court . So I 'm there , and I 'm just waiting for my food and I look across the way , and I see him . I just see him . You see " him " who ? Fischer . I see Fischer . Who 's Fischer ? Charles Fischer . I don 't know who you 're talking about . You do . You know him . Charles Fischer . Sent back from the future and he works for the machines . And he 's gonna die . What are you doing ? Feeling what it 's like to get away from it all . I don 't think you are . - What ? - If by " feelings " you mean " emotions " I 'm pretty sure you still don 't have any of those . And if by " feeling " you mean what it feels like to have the wind blow through your toes or your hair I 'm pretty sure you can 't feel that either . I don 't think you understand how we work . I have sensation . I feel . I wouldn 't be worth much if I couldn 't feel . So go through this again . - I 've gone through it again . - One more time . I told you , I 'm at the mall- - Just skip to where you follow this man to the garage and hit him with a brick . He 's a Grey , Derek . At least tell me you remember the Greys . Of course I remember the Greys . They were traitors . They worked for Skynet . - Helped the Trip-8s act more human . - You don 't remember him ? He was on the top of the list . Tell him . Tell him who you are and why you 're here . I don 't know what you 're talking about . My name is Paul Stewart . That 's my license . Look at it . Please . - I 'm not who she says I am . - Liar . It 's a mistake . For your sake , brother , I hope you 're right . STEWART : I told you . Paul Stewart . I- - I repair watches . I have a shop in Pasadena . That 's my license . What are you doing here , Fischer ? Paul Stewart . I was looking for an Omega 321 movement . There 's a secondhand store- - [ GRUNTING ] Tin cans didn 't send him back here to fix watches . I think we all know that . Why don 't you save us the trouble and tell us the truth ? Why are you here ? I 'm Paul Stewart , I live on Blackburn Avenue . - Your name is Fischer . - No . - You work for Skynet . - Skynet ? No . What are you doing here , you murdering bastard ? DEREK : Hey , hey , hey . Do I know you ? No , you don 't know me . And I don 't know her . I- - I don 't . For the love of God , I 'm not Charles Fischer . I 'm not . I need you to be sure . - Sure of what ? - Him . - I am sure . You don 't trust me ? - It 's not that I don 't trust you . It 's- - I knew the Greys , Jesse . I knew them just like you did . They were war criminals . We caught four . Right , but we couldn 't find Fischer . They kept him hidden . He was too valuable . You really don 't remember ? Listen , if he is who you say he is he deserves whatever is gonna happen to him . But not until he tells us who he is and what he 's doing here . Do you understand ? - He is who I say he is . - I wanna hear him say it . He will . I 'll show you . [ MAN SPEAKING OVER RADIO ] - Where 's the rest of him ? - It 's not here . Not possible . We destroyed his chip . He didn 't walk out of here , but he 's gone . There 's only one other person who knew about this . And only one other person crazy enough to dig him up . You hungry ? - Not hungry . - You a vegetarian ? No , I just- - I don 't know what 's in that . Cheeseburger 's in that . Eat . Where 's your friend ? Out . I 'm not who she thinks I am . Well , I sure hope not . I fix watches . I used to be an engineer . But it got old . I was just a guy in a cubicle with a bunch of other guys in cubicles . So I decided to go to Bern to learn watch repair . It 's in Switzerland . You ever been to Switzerland ? That 's a nice story . You don 't believe me . I 've told a few myself . Is she your girlfriend , this , um , woman ? Do you love her ? It 's complicated . Oh . I know complication , I 'm a watchmaker . It 's a watch joke . If I were you , I 'd eat . Listen to me . People do crazy things when they 're in love . Well , I do . But this is insane . She says that you know me and clearly you don 't know me . There 's something wrong with her . DEREK : So , what 'd they get you for ? Did you hear what I just said ? That 's prison ink . Where 'd you do time ? - I haven 't done any time . - Yes , you have . No . It 's a tattoo . I- - I fix watches . It 's a clock . With no hands . It means " till the end of time . " Life sentence . If I had a life sentence , what would I be doing here ? That 's what I 'm trying to figure out . Lunch is over . [ ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO ] [ POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO ] [ DANCE MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO ] [ CELL PHONE RINGING ] - Hello ? - Hey . It 's Derek . Is it ? DEREK [ OVER PHONE ] : I know . Shocks the hell out of me too . Listen , I need to talk- - [ CELL PHONE RINGING ] Hello ? [ BEEPS ] I need to talk to you . [ PHONE BEEPING ] CAMERON : So talk . - I 'm sending a picture to your phone . [ PHONE BEEPING ] - I got it . - Who is it ? I don 't know . Never seen him ? Not in your memory banks or whatever ? There 's no record of him ? No . Who is he ? He 's ... . He 's just this guy . I thought maybe I knew him . He looks hurt . Don 't worry about it . - Who was that ? - Derek . Derek ? What did he say ? Is everything okay ? Is Mom okay ? Everything 's okay . Don 't worry about it . Can I help you ? I was waiting . I heard ... . - Do you remember me ? - Of course I remember you . I have a ... . It 's possible I have an emergency . You came to my office over a month ago . You said your son needed help . Therapy . I never saw either of you again . Wait . Dr. Sherman , please . I 've had some bad luck with shrinks . Well , you could stop calling them shrinks . That might help . - Sorry . - It 's okay . My assistant will be here tomorrow morning at 7 . Make an appointment . - I 'm here now . - Sarah . Make an appointment , please . We 'll see what we can do . I 've been sick . Flu or something . I 'm exhausted . I can 't sleep . And when I do , I have dreams . Nightmares , actually . I walk in my sleep . Where are you walking to ? - What do you mean ? - Where do you go when you walk ? I 'm chasing someone , or I 'm being chased . But where do you go ? Out . I get the hell out . You 're here . Come on in . There are many things I don 't understand . Like what ? The tortoise . What tortoise ? It was on its back by the side of the road in Mexico . - Your mother turned it over . - She was helping it . I know , but why ? Because that 's what we do . When we , uh ... . When we see something that 's in pain or in trouble or whatever , we try and help it . Empathy . Something like that . But not everyone would turn the tortoise over . No . Some would just leave it there . Some would probably drive over it and crush it . Yeah , I guess they would . Is that what you 'd do ? It didn 't seem like much of a threat . We 're not built to be cruel . Yeah , that 's one for cyborgs . Yes . That 's one for us . [ GRUNTING ] Cameron . What are you doing ? - The body is gone . - What ? Cromartie 's body is gone . That 's impossible . You 're the one who knew where we buried it . We need it . - We have to destroy it . - What would I possibly want with it ? Cameron . - He 's lying . - You don 't know that . Please . John . If you know , you better tell me right now . I don 't know . [ CHOKING ] I don 't know . Let him go . - Why ? JOHN : He 's telling the truth . - We could find out for certain . - Let him go . Sorry . [ GRUNTING ] DEREK : What the hell ? He doesn 't wanna tell us who he is ? - I brought proof . - Proof ? [ GRUNTS ] Please . Please don 't hurt me . Don 't hurt me , please . - It 's up to him . - Who is he ? - Who are you ? - My name is Charlie Fischer . You were at my job . SRF . We do seismic retrofitting . I 'm a service technician , that 's all . I 'm nobody . I don 't even know what I 'm doing here . Tell him who you are . I 've already told you who I am . This is a trick . Some crazy trick , and you 're all in on it . And you too . What do you want from me ? I want you to tell the truth . FISCHER : Oh , God . [ CRYING ] DEREK : If he is who you say he is- - - He is . All right , fine . He is . We need to know what he 's doing here . - Unless he 's AWOL like you . - He 's not . Not this guy . Not Charles Fischer . He 's been sent back by them for a reason . You need to beat the hell out of him . You need to get him to talk . [ SCREAMING ] FISCHER : Please . No , please . Please . - I 'm sorry . Really . [ SCREAMING ] JESSE : Derek . - Don 't hurt the boy . Don 't- - Some people , you can beat them and beat them , and they 'll take it . Whatever pain you give them , they absorb it . Like it was theirs all along and all you 're doing is giving it back to them . You see , deep down , they hate themselves and they use that hate to eat the pain . See , we were all good once . We all loved ourselves once . As young men . Trying to get through the day . Or as kids . Playing in the park . - Okay . STEWART : Stop it . Stop it . Stop it . My name is Charles Fischer . I 'm Charles Fischer . Now let him go . He 's got nothing to do with this . Just let him go . This is impossible . Can 't you people see that this is insane ? Why are you here ? - Why did they send you back ? - They didn 't . - I 'm not here on a mission . - Nobody comes back without a mission . This is my reward . When the bombs dropped , I was locked up in Pelican Bay . Solitary confinement . Life sentence . If I hadn 't been in prison I never would 've made it through Judgement Day . Once they got their hands on me it was either I teach them everything I learned inside or say goodbye . And what did you learn ? I learned what makes people tick . [ GRUNTING ] BOYD : So the fever that brought on the dreams was caused by something you ate , you think , in Mexico . Yes . - What were you doing in Mexico ? - Vacation . - Family vacation ? - Yes . Has anything happened since I saw you last ? What do you mean ? I mean , have you suffered a trauma ? A crisis in the family something more between you and John since I 've seen you last . I came to you for help in understanding my dreams . Well , the problem is , without knowing the details of your life I 'm not sure what I can tell you beyond generalities . I can tell you that dreams tend to mirror the central conflict in the dreamer . Would it be accurate to say that the central conflict in your life is your son ? Yes . And your daughter , you have less conflict with . - It 's different with her . - What is ? Conflict , the type of conflict , the nature of your relationship , what ? Everything . - Specifically . - I don 't wanna talk about her . Then why are you here ? You come in here pretending to wanna talk about your dreams and refusing to talk about John and Cameron . Which , in my opinion , is what your obsession with the three dots is all about . So if you only wanna talk about one of those dots there 's not much I can do . I have no one else to talk to . Nothing is going to happen in here until you decide to be honest . You seem surprised . Judgement Day . Machines . You have no idea what you 'd do . What 's the hardest decision you 've ever had to make ? Huh ? Whether to stay with Rebecca or take a chance on Christine ? Whether to ask for time off for Grandfather 's funeral because you 're too afraid you 'll be fired if you just take it ? You think you know who you are ? You don 't have a clue . Can 't you just tell them what they wanna know ? What 's it matter now ? You 're here . You 're safe . Are you ? No . He 's playing with us . He 's making us think he 's weak . - He 's not weak . - How do you know ? I know , all right ? I know . You may not remember , but I know . He is the worst of them . He 's the worst . He needs to die , Derek . Forget why he 's here . Forget whatever the mission is . He just needs to die . What did he do ? Jess , what did he do to you ? There was a raid on a bunker . Metal was everywhere . They took out our command . Killed everyone over 30 . Killed the children . They took the prisoners to this place . [ INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ] He was there . [ GRUNTING ] Said he was going to teach them how to talk to people how to get information from people how to be people . It was a kind of perverse theater like he was teaching them . DEREK : How long did it go on ? Weeks . Months . There were drugs and starvation . And he talked to you for hours for days . Just to break you down just to get to your inner ... . To get to you . DEREK : How 'd you get out ? I don 't know . You never told me . What ? It wasn 't me Fischer had , baby . It was you . [ GROANING ] Go to hell . Go to hell . JESSE : You don 't remember . I can 't believe you don 't remember . But it was you . My name is Derek Reese . First lieutenant , 132nd S.O.C. - Yeah , well , good for you . DEREK : Not for you . - Told you I 'm not on a mission . - I don 't care . Oh , yeah . You remember . You remember now . I was wondering how long that was gonna take . No . I don 't remember . But she does . And that 's good enough for me . So . You gonna kill me ? Not you . [ GUNSHOT ] Oh , God . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . John . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to wake you . I wasn 't sleeping . I just needed to close my eyes for a few minutes . How 're you feeling ? SARAH : What does this mean to you ? I keep seeing it in my dreams , John . It means something . Mom , you 're tired . You 've been sick . Chasing killer robots will do that to you . We couldn 't find Cromartie 's body . It wasn 't there . It 's gone . Ellison . - He doesn 't have it . - Are you sure ? I 'm sure . Cromartie was in my dreams . It 's connected . It 's all connected . Mom , you had a dream . It was my fault . What was your fault ? Cromartie . I led him to you . What are you talking about ? There was this kid , a boy in the bowling alley . He was with the guys who broke into our house . And I should ... . I knew what I had to do , John . I didn 't do it . I let him go . Cromartie must have found him . We are not murderers . You 're not . Tell that to the boy . I 'm sure he 's dead . We have to find that body , John . You don 't think he 'll talk young Fischer ? We had to let him go . - He 's not the monster we just buried . - Let 's hope he doesn 't become one . Do you remember any of it ? Even a flash ? No . Nothing . It was all we talked about , Derek . What he 'd done . How you were gonna find him one day . You were obsessed . It was a trauma . You 've blocked it . Maybe . Maybe not . - Maybe it never happened to me . - Derek . I was there . Maybe I came from a future where it never happened and now you 've come from a future where it did . Is that possible ? Ever since I 've been back here , I 've done things . I 've changed things . Maybe I changed the future . That 's why we 're here , isn 't it ? To change the future . Do you think there 's a version of the future where we 're not together ? No . [ BEEPS ] [ DOOR BUZZES ] - Charles Fischer ? - Yeah . FBI , Department of Homeland Security . Need you to come with us , please . Two nights ago , you entered the building , unauthorized , at 4 : 16 a.m. What were you doing here ? That 's a mistake . Two nights ago ? No . I wasn 't there . I would have no reason to be there at that time . Computers don 't lie , Mr. Fischer . At 4 : 23 , seven minutes after you entered the building there was an unauthorized access to the computer networking system . FISCHER : That wasn 't me . - This system allows the user access to all primary military-industrial complex computer systems . I 'm telling you that this is all a big mistake . I do seismic retrofitting . I don 't know how to access a computer system . Why would I do that ? BALDWIN : I don 't know , Mr. Fischer . You tell me . Why would you install a roving backdoor into those computer systems ? One that we can 't dismantle so far . You wanna tell us how to do that ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I wasn 't there . What happened to you ? You look a little banged up . You wanna explain that ? I don 't know if I can . Try . So what is it you wanted to show me ? We need to learn how they work . How to fight them . [ INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ] We can 't allow history to repeat itself not when we have the power to stop it . It 's up to us now . The two of us . Yes . It is . What am I doing here ? I don 't know . It 's a waste of time . You just lie and lie . It 's a waste of time . I just lie and lie . - Don 't you have things to do ? - Yes . I do . I have things to do . I should get back to work . [ ENGLISH SDH ]

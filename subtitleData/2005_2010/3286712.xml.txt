 - Where are you ? - In Michigan . I found her . I found ... Nina . Wait a minute . Are you telling me that you had this procedure done ? I have a heightened sense of empathy . What happened here ? The second stage primate trials . Injected with my stem cells . They did this to themselves . Oh , my God . I spent the evening with Enuka Okimba . - You know Enuka ? - Hottest virologist in the US . Quite the reputation . I was referring to her science . Yes , so was I. What do you want ? Wes ' job . Done . I love you , David Sandström ! Something 's wrong . What 's going on here ? Get back to your work ! - What are we making ? - Weaponized measles . - Stop it ! Stop ! - Your password . Showtime . You . - Is this the real thing ? Take it . - No ! Ms. Tran , line 2 . Hello ? Yeah , hi . I had a chance to look at your CV . No , Dr. Sandström hasn 't seen it yet . Believe me , hiring a virologist is a priority , but he 's not ready to do any interviews this week ... That 's right . I see that you did your graduate work with Jim Smiley , and your post-doc at NIH ? Yeah , a few of them . I liked your article in Nature , the HIV Infection angle of preventing MS. It 's on the edge , exactly where David likes to be . Ms. Tran , line 3 is still holding . You 're definitely on the short list . The rest is just up to David . Okay ? Great , bye . Ms. Tran , lines 2 and 3 are still holding . And there 's a Maggie and Stewart Berner here to see you . Ms. Tran ? Yeah , can you tell them that I 'm in a meeting , please ? Yes , ma 'am . Ah , shit . Jesus . Enuka Okimba . David Sandström . You look a little rough . It 's been a rough couple of years . Come on in . So was that message of yours serious ? Of course . You realize I don 't always play by the book . - Why should you ? - And I hate authority figures . I got my first detention in kindergarten . I don 't mind sleeping with the boss . Fine by me . Then I accept your job offer . Once we 've discussed my salary . Have you got any beer left ? Let me take your coat . Your test results came in . And keep in mind they 're just ... - preliminary , exploratory tests . - Please just tell me . You have elevated dopamine levels . Have you been feeling anxious , paranoid ... ? No . Are you sure ? Bob . I 'm fine . But ... I saw those monkeys too . I know what may be coming . So ? Well , the herpes virus is still hidden . We just need to treat it . I wish it were that easy . Nina , look at this . It 's overdone . It 's perfect . Is something wrong ? I 'm just glad it 's not overdone . ReGenesis 4x10 What It Feels Like Subtitles Team NorBAC Anyone , Bbsiocnarf , Dapitch666 Linwelin , Michvanilly Version NoTag 1.0 Just got it in last year . It 's an amazing machine . It 's great . Finally , your new home away from home . I hope it meets with your standards . That 's the tour . Welcome to NorBAC . Thanks , David . This is fantastic . Yeah , it 's pretty great , eh ? If there 's anything else you need , you just let me know . Are you all right ? David , we cannot do this . We can 't cooperate . I don 't fucking want to do this and I don 't fucking need to do this ! Then why are you here ? Contractual obligation , company rules , whatever ... lets you cash your cheque with a clear conscience . Look , I ... I just need ... some time alone , that 's all . Are you drinking ? Not nearly enough . David , you all right ? Rachel 's ? It 's 17 days . Shit . If it would be easier , I could tidy her belongings away , if you like . My history . I 'll take care of it . Thanks . I know we haven 't talked about this in a while , but now we 've ... re-staffed ... I met Rachel several times over the years . She was an amazing person . - Get the fuck out ! - I 'm a doctor ! Let me attend to her ! All I see , all that I want to do is grab one of those sons-of-bitches and toss him through a wall ! For what they did to her , it was not fair that they be killed quickly . I feel like I was robbed of an opportunity . To inflict pain ? Yes . Yes . To make them suffer the way I do , except far worse . Can you picture living with that ? If you were given the opportunity ? Yes , I can . That 's what gets me through the day . Consider this a homework assignment , reschedule this around our current investigations , but we have to figure out - what happened at Roth 's lab . - The dead monkeys ? The macaques were supposed to become peaceful , cooperative , empathetic . Instead they went apeshit and tore each other apart . Killed their keeper . And what Roth manipulated in the monkeys , - he first did to you . - Not exactly . We were trying to re-establish Bob 's eyesight using an experimental protocol . Yeah . I was trying . It was my bright idea . The delivery system , a herpes virus , was to deliver a growth factor to my optic nerve . But instead it took a billion-to-one side trip to Bob 's Jacobson 's Organ . The chemosensory organ located behind the nose . It 's sensitive to chemical signals between animals . In the lower orders , it 's like telepathy . - But dormant in humans . - Until now . In a higher order like Bob , you get empathy . He 's annoyingly sensitive to other people 's emotions . Fear , despair , anger ... it 's overwhelming at times . What about joy or love ? Also overwhelming . If it weren 't for Bob 's Asperger 's syndrome , it would probably send him over the deep end . - Before Roth kidnapped Bob ... - I went willingly . Yeah . We were trying to turn off the herpes virus with an antiviral : acyclovir . - I gather it didn 't work . - Another mystery worth investigating . Our best guess is that the viral DNA somehow inserted itself in Bob 's cellular DNA . But if Bob 's fine and the test primates are dead , - why are we taking a look at this ? - Nina . My fiancée . Roth 's human guinea pig . Willingly , David . If humans follow the same timeline as the monkeys , in a week , possibly two , Nina may begin to experience the same violent tendencies . So this is a little more serious than homework . Bob , how is Nina doing ? She 's fine . She seems a little preoccupied at times . All this waiting . All these tests ... Did she experience the same empathy effect ? Yes , she did . See , Mr. Roth believed that if we felt each other 's emotions as our own , then we could eliminate war , greed , murder . A revolution through compassion . But Roth rushed the science , which was questionable to begin with . We experimented and found the number of cells and delivery protocols The monkeys ' behaviour changed . Aggression declined , cooperation increased . And then it all went to Hell , Bob . People , we gotta figure out a way to turn off Nina 's Jacobson 's Organ . First prize : you get to be emcee at Bob 's wedding . Welcome . Excuse me . Hey , sorry I 'm late . What 's going on ? We were just filling Enuka in on Nina 's situation . Yeah , I got that e-mail . Mayko Tran , Enuka Okimba , our new virologist . You mean the new virologist who wasn 't cleared by security ? The new virologist who didn 't have to be vetted by any of our 3 governing bodies ? Excuse me ... It was nice to meet you . I think I know what we need in lab personnel . This is so typical of you , David . You can never keep your personal life separate from your professional life and then you leave the rest of us picking up the pieces . Who the fuck are you ? Enuka Okimba . Our new virologist . She 's competent , outgoing , and I 'm sure she has all the qualities that NorBAC needs , and I feel horrible for saying this , but ... She 's not Rachel . I 'm sorry . I miss her . I know you do . I thought you weren 't back till tomorrow ! You . - Test it on me ! - Come . - Test it on me ! - No . Her . - Come . - Wait ! But you feel partly to blame for her death ? Rachel wouldn 't want me believing that . She was an understanding person , an amazing scientist and ... a good friend . And yet ... ? I 'm not hiding any guilt . I know that terrible things happen every day . Human beings inflict as much pain and death as any other predator species . I don 't mean to sound dismissive . In fact I find myself thinking what she must have been thinking at that moment . Hearing the trigger squeezed , thinking ... " Why me ? " And then nothing . What are you feeling so guilty about ? We never should have gone through with this . But I let Mr. Roth convince me . No . You let me convince you . I wanted this . Listen . Baby , I 'm one of those people , okay ? When the spaceship lands , I want on board . This was my chance to enter a new world , and I got to be there with you . Bonus . You 're worried about me . You can 't keep blaming yourself , because I don 't . You 're still feeling guilty . I 'm not . I am not feeling guilty . Stop it . Come here . - Where are you going ? - I 've got a lunch across town . Yeah ? With who ? A potential virologist I was going to pre-interview for you . I reviewed a study by Andrews and Maron , where they thought they saw herpes simplex integrate into chromosome 11 , but no one believed it . - They could only detect by FISH . - Run the experiment past Bob , he 's really good at finding holes in things . Of course it 's almost impossible to ID the virus and see if it 's replicating without a slice of Nina 's brain . That 's too bad . - You know what I mean . - I know what you mean . Would a slice of monkey brain do ? You brought back samples ? - Where are you going ? - I 've got a lunch across town . Yeah ? With who ? A potential virologist I was going to pre-interview for you . Ms. Tran ? Ms. Tran . Please . Our daughter has aplastic anaemia . Her bone marrow doesn 't work . She 's dying . Please , just read this report . She 's only 6 years old . We have nowhere else to go . - Got a minute ? - Sure . What do you know about aplastic anaemia ? She 's deteriorating rapidly . Red blood cells are borderline , and white blood cells and platelets are down . Bone marrow transplants are really painful , right ? They can be , yeah . The marrow is irradiated to kill all the cells and the immune system is suppressed before the donor cells are introduced . Some patients never survive the procedure . How do you know the family ? And then after that , the new marrow is transplanted . That 's only if it 's a very close HLA match , which is quite rare . Usually , best chance is with a sibling , even then , it 's only a 35 % probability . Remember that case , they made test-tube babies to create donors ? That 's unsubstantiated science fiction . It 's genetic ? Sometimes . Do you think she looks like me ? Yeah , her eyes ... her smile . When is the last time you saw her ? The day after she was born . She was so tiny ... It must have been ... a hard decision . Not as hard as you 'd think . Well , even though it 's a slim chance , you should contact the father and ... have him tested to see if he 's a match . Are you still in touch with him ? Well , maybe you 'll have the chance to give her life twice . It only takes a blood test to find out . Sorry I 'm late . Nina ? Did I wake you ? - No ! - Nina ! It 's happening . Louis settling down okay ? He pissed in my kitchen . You must be making him nervous . You find a place to board him yet ? David , he 's just not good in kennels . He hates other dogs . He 's a people dog . He likes you . David , are you busy ? There might be a way to differentiate between Bob 's stem cells and Nina 's , and if we could do that , we could open up a way of exploring different treatment options . Any luck ? I tried retinoic acid , nerve growth factor , brain-derived neurotropic factor ... Nothing . Bob 's cells would have divided , specialized by now , it 's bound to be a maze . Maybe titrate up ? - We overpower him ... - I prefer not to anger armed men . - They 're going to kill us ! - You don 't know that ! When I add it all up , the last three years , before Rachel was ... Hira was shot right in front of me . And I just never thought ... I just never thought that I would see something like that ... in person . I know I work in a science lab , I deal with death all the time , but ... But murder is ... Murder is something that you see on the news . And ... And you say " That 's awful , " you know , and then you go on with your life , or you change the channel . And 18 months later , the suicide attack ... Lying there , wondering why I could see a part of my body torn off ... Your recovery from those events , both physically and emotionally , was exceptional . Yeah , but now , with Rachel gone , I just ... Oh , God . I 'm just wondering , " what 's next ? " I 've never gotten the sense that you 're the type of person to repress . Sure , I 'm dealing with it . Care to say how ? Cut myself off . I 've already got one phantom limb , why not the whole body ? Excuse me . - Where you going ? - I 'll be back in two hours . - You just got here . - And now I 'm going . What is it with you ? When you 're here , you 're not here , when you 're not here , at least we can breathe . Breathe deeply . You 've got a lot of work with these two jobs . Maybe you should think about moving back to bioinformatics . - Are you demoting me ? - I 'm close . It 's not about the job . It 's personal . I have a daughter at Sick Kids . She has aplastic anaemia and she needs a bone marrow transplant , - and I 'm not a donor match . - You have a daughter ? Gave her up for adoption . Now I 'm going back to the hospital to repeat the blood test - in case there was an error . - Jesus , Mayko ... Look , I 'll be back soon . I 'm sorry about all this . - Sorry . - Sorry . Hi , David . What 's wrong ? Acyclovir didn 't work on me . We 've got nothing else . Not yet . Yet ? There 're some cancer treatments that blast stem cells . But how can you differentiate between my stem cells and Nina 's own ? - She would become anaemic . - It 's all we 've got so far . Nina , can you describe the state you were in when you attacked Bob ? - Carlos , she didn 't really attack me . - Bob . I felt like he 's was going to suffocate me . It was like I didn 't know who he was but I knew he meant me harm . - And you felt this ? - I saw it . I was hallucinating . I had another hallucination where I stabbed Bob in the hand . Bob , Nina 's on the edge here . She needs to be someplace where she won 't harm herself - or anybody else . - But she wouldn 't . I 'm sure she wouldn 't . It 's not me anymore , Bob . Not all the time . Once we check into the hospital , what 're the chances of treating her with anything other than psychotropic drugs ? If anything we 've been investigating here has any merit , the hospital won 't let us use it . Or if they do , it 'll take months to get administrative approval . I 'm afraid . And I need help . There is something we can do here , now . When we really need the hospital , then ... Taking her there now would be like giving up , David . How long will the sedative last ? She 'll be groggy about 4 hours . Hey , did Mayko tell you about her friend ? - Her friend ? - The little girl , at the hospital , friend of hers . Her daughter . I saw her . Aplastic anaemia . It 's tough . Mayko flunked out as a match . She went back to get re-tested . Parents are rarely , if ever , a good match . How old is she ? The little girl ? Six . Hey . So , how is she ? Not good . Sorry . I need to get in touch with ... the father . Excuse me . I thought about an abortion , okay , but then I kept thinking : " You were adopted , Mayko . People are always looking for babies . " You never considered talking to me about this ? It was so obvious that you didn 't want another kid . You barely saw the one you already had ! That 's your take on it , and it 's hardly the point . David , what were we back then ? Another one of your student-professor relationships . I needed a solid guy , not some uncommitted temperamental alcoholic asshole ! - I 'm sorry , but ... - How fucking dare you ? How dare you dump this on me like I shouldn 't have a fucking feeling about it ? You want to have a feeling ? Maggie and Stewart Berner . That 's his cell number . That 's the hospital room . Oh , excuse me . Are you the specialist ? I 'm sorry , say again ? Dr. Denver told us there 's a medical conference in town , that several blood specialists would be here and that he 'd try to be in touch . Are you ... ? A specialist , no . I 'm the father . The ... the biological father . Mayko found you . Yeah , Mayko found me . So ... you understand , about Hannah 's illness ? Who do I see about this test ? I can find the herpes viral DNA in the monkey samples , but there 's no indication it 's replicating . And it sure looks chromosomal . Did you probe with other herpes strains ? Yes . There 's nothing . Do they all look like this ? Well , there 's a few samples where the herpes virus is more prevalent . Sorry I 'm late . - The herpes DNA ? - Yes . Shit , it has integrated . How many more cells have it ? 10 to 20 % , but I haven 't determined any correlation between these samples , however . How many samples are showing this increase ? 3 out of 24 . - Thanks for all your help , Enuka . - You 're welcome . Bob . - How 's Nina ? - She 's still sedated . It 's disconcerting to see her like this , but I 'm grateful she 's here . That 's okay . Go do your thing . Thank you . What 're you doing tonight ? I gotta get the hell out of that hotel , so I 'm going to go see some apartments . You feel like having another look at mine ? So , what have you got ? The last 3 monkeys injected with my stem cells ; I detected some extra chromosomal viral DNA . I 'm staining for herpes proteins as we speak . They might actually be replicating . We found no replicating virus in the previous set , so if what you 're seeing is right , at the start of the operation the virus begins to replicate , but as time passes it becomes dormant ? Anything else administered in conjunction with the stem cells ? Saline . Completely innocuous . Were they anaesthetized ? Some kind of interaction between the anaesthetic and my stem cells ? Something has to be activating the herpes virus . Bob ! Wait ! Carlos , get a sedative ! Nina ! Nina ! Let 's get her to the couch , come on . Sedative 's not going to last long . We need to get some restraints . - I 'll go get something . - She needs to be admitted , Bob . I think I may have found something . Carlos ? Maybe . We were conjecturing . David , please . Just ten minutes , please ... We don 't know what type of anaesthetic was used to knock out the monkeys , eh ? We don 't have those records . I suspect it was ketamine combined with some kind of opioid . And that , what , interacted with Bob 's stem cells and the herpes virus got stimulated ... ? Ketamine can increase dopamine levels . If they made a mistake in the dosage ... We don 't have time for maybes and maybe nots . Don 't we have a definitive conclusion here ? These monkeys had a replicating virus . They were the most recent test subjects . The previous ones had no virus . So you would have got the dose right with this group ? Yes . Maybe it has something to do with ketamine blocking the NMDA receptor ? Maybe . We got a whole lot of maybes here and Nina should be on a program of anti-psychotics while we figure this out . It doesn 't mean we 're giving up , Bob . You can be with her as much as you want . Bob , she has elevated dopamine levels , like the monkeys . This can lead to psychosis . We should try Risperidone . - It 's a strong dopamine-blocking drug . - What are the side effects ? Insomnia , low blood pressure , tremors , the usual risks ... diabetes , ketoacidosis . I hate this . She 's coming to . Maggie Berner called . You were a marginally better match . But not enough . So that 's it ? Well , I can 't ... I can 't change my blood type . I still cannot believe , after everything we 've been through together , that you never once thought ... I thought about it every fucking day , David , okay ? I 'm sorry , I didn 't see anything that made me want to talk about it . Well , we are gonna fucking talk about it now . I can 't undo the past , okay ? You keep going there if that 's how you need to do it . Looks scary , but she 's fine . It 's going to take some time , Bob . You should get home , get some rest . I will . I just wanna watch her for a while . Okay . Thanks , Carlos . What ? What ? What 's happening ? He 's staring . He 'll lose interest . That 's what I 'm worried about . Come on , David . This isn 't a performance review . Then again , it could be . What ? What ? David ... You know what ? If she wanted me to support her , if that had been her choice , I would 've supported her . You know , to cut me out of the equation like that , it 's just so fucking cold . I know . I know . It 's harsh . Doesn 't make her a bad person . I have a little girl . I have a daughter that I never knew about . David , why don 't you think of this as a beautiful gift ? The little girl 's gonna die . She 's gonna die . There 's nothing I can do about it . If I 'd known about it , if I had been there when she was born , I sh ... I ... Fuck ! What ? If I 'd been there when she was born ! My daughter ! When my daughter was born ... My first ... When my first daughter was born , Lilith , her mother and I , we signed her up for this new service . We ... We saved her cord blood . We saved her cord blood ! It was a brilliant idea . It should never be privatized . Cord blood from a half-sibling ? Here it is . I just hope they 're still in business . It was a long shot . Lilith isn 't a perfect match either , but she 's a better match than Mayko , me , or anything in the blood bank . There 's still a chance she might reject them . Yes , but remember , these are stem cells we 're talking about . They 're very potent , flexible . Most importantly , once in her system , they 'll become exactly what she needs them to be . Pure , fresh virginal bone marrow . That 's a beautiful idea . We 're really lucky David did this . Eighteen years ago , no one was storing cord blood . Thank you so much ... You can 't get at it , not in words , what she means to us ... It 's okay . We understand . Stewart and I feel that it wouldn 't be right to go back to the way it was . To just pretend that you don 't exist . We were hoping after ... you could still be a part of her life . That you 'd be in her life . Yeah . We 'd all be lucky to have you . All ready then ? Clear the hallway , please . Hey , sweetie . Ready to be brave , little girl ? Yes , Mama . Okay , kiddo . - Let 's go . - Bye . See you . Bye , Hannah . Let 's do this . She 's improved remarkably , but normally it takes weeks to notice the effects of anti-psychotic drugs . But we are going to keep an eye on you , in case of adverse reactions . I understand . There 's a functional MRI scheduled for this afternoon , and we 'll take a look at the Jacobson 's Organ . But your cognitive function 's improving and your vitals are approaching normal . These ? You need those for your own safety , Nina . All right ? I 'll check in on you later . Thanks , Dr. Bruen . Actually , I 'd like to see a battery of tests . Is the MRI enough ? Come here . Beside me . We 're gonna get through this , alright ? I feel a difference . Don 't you ? Can 't you feel me ? Sorry . Just undo one . I want to hold you so much . We have to be careful . Then loosen it just a little . Don 't you miss me ? The board meeting 's been pushed 'till next Thursday . I 've blocked out Wednesday afternoon - evening for a quick internal review . And that malaria outbreak in Oaxaca has supposedly been stabilized - but I 'm keeping my eye on it . - Okay . Hannah ? She was a trooper during chemotherapy . The transplant went as well as they could hope for , but they won 't know if her system accepts the new stem cells for a while . They . Not we ? They 're the family , David . Offer was on the table . Yeah , it was . I mean , we made that little girl , Mayko . We 've got a chance here to do something . And what would that something be , David ? I don 't know ... I don 't know . There 's ... There 's a conference coming up in Rio that you might be interested in . But , I mean , we should do something , right ? I 'll leave it for you to think about . - Was it you that called earlier ? - Yeah . You wanted to know if everything was okay . I took off one of her restraints . She asked me to . She pulled the keychain out of my pocket , the one with the little Army knife on it ? And then she started stabbing herself . Your hands ... I tried to take the knife away from her . It 's so little ... It 's ridiculous to call it even a knife ... Where is she ? To be understated , her recovery was obviously misleading . Have you taken her off the Risperidone ? No . There could still be some traces of Acyclovir in her system , and I 'd like to see how she reacts to the Risperidone on its own . And if that doesn 't work ? Lithium ... Prozac ... ? There 're thousands of different chemicals in the brain . When there 's an imbalance like this , it 's not easy coming up with a cocktail . - And in some cases ... - You never do . Thank you . When she was stabbing herself , she looked me in the eyes and told me that she loved me . Every time the knife went in ... I could feel it . I understand . Take it easy . I 'm on my way . - What ? - Nina 's got a blood clot or something . They don 't think she 's gonna make it through the night . I did this to her . I was playing God , I was meddling with the human species . I have no right to call myself a scientist . I don 't know what to do . Telling everybody that your kid was dragged off by a fanged creature isn 't screwing with the system ; that 's crazy . My boy was killed by a monster ! You don 't think she did this to my boy ? - She didn 't do anything to Billy . - You don 't know her anymore . I only found one pint of blood . A boy his size and weight should have 3 or 4 quarts . I saw it , Enuka . Dragging him off . Some farmer shot something down here this morning . Something ? - It 's a coyote . - This is not . It is , according to the barcode database . Hair samples under the boy 's fingernails : not a match to the coyote tissue . What 's going on ?

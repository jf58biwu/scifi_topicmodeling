 What is the point of skateboarding ? With you , there 's always gotta be a point . It 's skateboarding , it 's fun . It just is . Careful . Clyde fights Slitheens and Gorgons , that 's okay , but a bit of skateboarding , and whoa ! I know . But I 've changed since I met you lot , I 've gone all mumsy . Change for the better . Remember that day we moved in ? Talk about frosty ! - I was not ! - Yes , you were . No , you 've got it wrong . You 've got to bend your legs . If you want to ollie , bend your legs . Okay , and you would know exactly , what ? Well , as it happened ... King of the Concrete , Romford , 1992 . - Yeah , right . Oh , no , here we go . - And he 's still got it . - But you 're old . Gotta get pictures of this . Cheese , smile . - I 'll take them . - It 's all right , you get in . Loose tracks . Loose tracks . One , two , three , smile . - Sarah Jane , let 's get one of you . - Just a minute . Ready . One , two ... What 's up ? Somebody just walked over my grave . - Come on , quick . - Okay , ready , smile . That 's it . - Right , come on , let 's go home . Too old , am I ? - Why 'd you give it up ? - Can 't make a living out of a skateboard . - Actually , Mum said ... - Now she 's gone , maybe I 'll get my board down . - Please say you 're joking . - I 'm good , why can 't I ? Even if you are good , you 're still too old for a skateboard . Sorry . See ya . Bend your knees ! Come on , let 's get some tea on . I 'll be a minute . Luke borrowed a book , I need it back . - What goes on over there ? - Nothing . I reckon you 're having secret parties without me . Hurry up , then . Mr Smith , I need you . Hello , Sarah Jane . - Report the position of Meteor K67 , please . Meteor K67 , ascension of 20 hours , 13 minutes and 42 seconds . Declination of minus 22 degrees , Vmagnitude brightening from 11 to 3.3 with a sky motion of 11.3 degrees . Heading for the Earth , authorities can 't see it . It 's coming through a radar blind spot . - Of course , why didn 't I realise that ? - If it hits us , bang , end of the world . - You 're being a bit calm . - No need to worry . When it 's in range , Mr Smith will create a pulse , and bounce the meteor back into space . All in a day 's work . You 're gonna save the world , and no one knows about it . - No , I like it better that way . - Mr Smith , how long do we have ? The meteor will be in range of the pulse at 2.45 p. m. tomorrow . - All systems are prepared . - You see ? No worries . But if it wasn 't for Sarah Jane , we 'd all be dead . Luke , put the kettle on . I 'm parched . Be down in a sec . Sure . See you later , Maria . Just wanted a word in private . - This is for you . - Wow . It 's beautiful . Where 'd you get it ? That Verron soothsayer we helped fly home the other week , it 's from him . - What 's it for ? - I don 't know . He said , " Remember . " Whatever that means . So why are you giving it to me ? He said , " Give it to the person you trust the most . " And that 's you . It 's probably best not to tell Luke that bit . - What 's in it ? - Have a look . How do you open it ? It 's impossible . - Which you knew . - I tried . Mr Smith said there 's nothing in it . Just a puzzle box . And I forgot about it till this afternoon . - But there , it 's yours . - Thank you . Pop over tomorrow , let me know how you get on . - Plus , we can bash that meteor . - Oh , should be fun . Yes ! That must be it . Maria , turn that telly off , you should be asleep ! Oh ! Yes . Is that it then ? Maria ! Maria ! Dad ! - What 's the matter ? - I 'm fine . - You sure ? - Yeah , it was just a bad dream . All right , good night . - Morning . You okay now ? - Yeah . Look what I got from the loft . Oh , no . Dad ! - So I 'm too old , am I ? - Just don 't use it anywhere near me . Where 'd you get those plants from ? From Andrea , housewarming present , remember ? Oh , don 't forget to sign her birthday card . What do you mean ? Who 's Andrea ? - Don 't be daft , just sign it . - Okay . If you say so . I 'm going over to see Luke . - Luke ? - Yeah , Luke . - Luke 's a lad from school , is he ? - Shut up . What 's wrong with you this morning ? Hello , love , you 're early . Where 's me birthday card , then ? - Oh , I was only joking . - Sorry , is Sarah Jane there ? - Say again ? - Sarah Jane . - One of your mates from school , is that ? - No , Sarah Jane . This is her house . I like a laugh , but it 's only 9 : 30 in the morning . I didn 't stop working till gone 3 : 00 . Once I start painting , I can 't stop . Try me later . You can help get things ready for the party . Sandwiches won 't butter themselves . - Is Luke there ? - Who ? You all right , love ? Maria ? Dad , something really weird is going on . - There 's this woman in Sarah Jane 's house . - Sorry ? I knocked on the door and there 's this woman . - Hold on . What door ? - Sarah Jane 's house . Number 13 . - Andrea 's ? - What ? Who 's Sarah Jane ? You can stop it now , it 's freaking me out . - I 'm not getting you . Sarah Jane ? - Sarah Jane Smith , our neighbour ? No one on this road called Sarah Jane . Not that I 've met . Course you have . Stop it . Right . I 'll show you . Look , Sarah Jane is definitely in the photos . What ? Where 's Luke ? And who ... Why is she there ? I 'm sorry . I don 't know any Sarah Janes and I don 't know any Lukes . What 's wrong ? Where 's Sarah Jane 's number gone ? No Luke , no Clyde ... Clyde . 07700900792 . - Hey , who 's that ? - Clyde ! It 's Maria . - Who ? - Me , Maria . - Maria Jackson ? - You 've gotta get here . Sarah Jane 's vanished ! - Maria Jackson from school ? - Yeah . Why are you phoning me ? I didn 't give you my number . Clyde , tell me . Is Luke with you ? - Luke ? - We were out yesterday , skateboarding ? - I bumped into you . No one called Luke , though . - Luke Smith ? Please tell me you 're all having a joke . - Was it Sarah Jane 's idea ? - Say again ? - Do you know Sarah Jane ? - If you wanna ask me out , just ask me out . - I can fit you in next Thursday . - Oh , no . Clyde ... - The meteor . - The what ? - There 's a huge meteor heading for Earth . - Oh , is there , now ? - Only Sarah Jane can stop it , and she 's vanished . - What are you talking about ? Laters , I 'm busy . Hello , love . Right , I 've surfaced . Come on , lots to do . Whatever . - But it 's different . - Well , all right , it 's a bit of a mess , but I 'm gonna clean it up before people come round . I can 't help it if I 'm so popular , the birthday girl . Maria ? Hang on , love , where you going ? Sorry . Is Maria here ? She was a bit upset . - She 's taken off up there . - What ? Maria ! - Do you know what 's going on ? - Not a clue . - Where is she ? - I don 't know who you 're talking about . - Sarah Jane Smith ! - Never heard of her . - I think you and me should go back to the house . - But Sarah Jane lives here . In this house , with her son , Luke . Where are they ? Mr Smith , I need you . - Mr Smith ? - Sweetheart ... There is no Mr Smith . There 's no Sarah Jane . No Smiths at all . - Dad , I ... - Right . We 're going home . Come on . Sorry about this . Sarah Jane Smith . Okay . So ... Yesterday evening , what did we do ? I picked you up from school . We walked home , went to the park . - We went with Andrea ? - No , she was just passing by . We bumped into a lad from school , Clyde . Who I don 't really know . You said you knew him vaguely . He 's in some of your classes . - You showed off your skateboarding to him ? - You were cringing . So when did I meet Andrea ? Look . That 's us outside , the day we moved in . Andrea came over and gave us a hand . But Sarah Jane was there . That 's when we met her , and she was all frosty . You 've got to remember that . You said so . Frosty . No , just Andrea . And she was lovely . Invited us over straight away . - She 's always having parties , lives life to the full . - I don 't remember any of that . Maybe you should get some sleep . Then maybe you 'll feel better , yeah ? You want me to forget Sarah Jane ? There is no Sarah Jane . This meteor thing , destroying the Earth , - it 's a bit silly , isn 't it ? - But ... I can see it all so clearly . Sarah Jane was so real to me . All the things we did , all the incredible things we saw ... Something happened last night , and Sarah Jane vanished . Nobody remembers , but I do . And somehow , when everything changed , I got protected . I 'm telling you , Dad , I 'm right . And I 'm gonna show you . " Sarah Jane Smith , solicitors . - " Sarah Jane Smith , Guernsey Women 's Football . " - Ugh . - There must be something . - I don 't think there will be . Hang on . My Poems , by Carla Morgan , for Sarah Jane Smith . " For Sarah Jane Smith , who left us 13th of July 1964 . " The woman that wrote this is the same age as Sarah Jane . - So ? - 1964 ... Have they got newspapers in the library , old newspapers ? - Should have , yeah . - Come on . Off to the library . Right , what have we got ? " Schoolgirl , Sarah Jane Smith , 13 , " died after falling from the edge of Westport Pier yesterday . " It 's just the same name , darling . " A second girl , Andrea Yates , is being treated for shock . " That 's our Andrea , from across the road . She 's Andrea Yates . - See ? I 'm not lying , there 's a connection . - Did Andrea tell you about this accident ? - Is that where you got the name from ? - I 'm telling the truth . Maria ! Dad , did you see that ? The names , they swapped over . Maria , help me . Maria ? - And that 's Sarah Jane 's voice . - Can you hear her ? - You can hear a voice ? - Dad , it was her . - Shh ! - Shh ! - Maria , you need to calm down . - You 've seen the evidence . - There is no evidence . I 've worked it out . Andrea 's done something , and Sarah Jane 's gone , just as that meteor 's about to smash into us . Sweetheart , that 's enough . I think I should take you to see a doctor . Maybe Andrea did say something about the accident . Well , that must be it . And that nightmare . Perhaps I 've got it all mixed up . I 'm really sorry . - Of course I know Andrea . - Maria . I have been so worried . - I didn 't hear a voice . I was making that up . - Why , sweetheart ? - I think I just wanted some attention . - Is there something else wrong ? At school ? - Have I done something wrong ? - No , it 's just me . Anything you want to talk about , I 'll give you attention . Thanks , Dad . But I think I should go and see Andrea . I should go and say sorry . Oh , that 's all right , love , there 's no need to apologise . When I was your age , the thoughts that would come into my head sometimes ! I don 't know where I got that name . Sarah Jane Smith . Means nothing to me , love . - Positive ? - Positive . But how could you forget ? 1964 ? School trip , the pier ? She fell , she died , and you were with her . - What ? - You lived , and she died . Only that wasn 't meant to happen . The key moment , when everything in the world changed . Andrea , help me ! - What happened ? - Take my hand ! - Get out of my house . - This isn 't your house ! This is some kind of time gone wrong , because in my world , the way things should have been , you died . Get out ! Enough of this . I 'm phoning your dad . I 'm gonna sort things out . I 'm gonna work out how time got changed , I 'm gonna find Sarah Jane and then I 'm gonna bring her back and nothing is gonna stop me . Oh . Oh , no . That day ... The pier ! Oh , Sarah ... Remember , Andrea , remember . - Who are you ? - Remember . Remember . I forgot you . I forgot what I did that day . All these years , living this life ... You forgot me , Andrea Yates . I never forgot you . The day she died , you gave me this box . My gift . - Why are you calling me now ? - Maria Jackson , over the road . She keeps going on about Sarah Jane . She knows . She knows what I did that day , and she 's made me remember . She 's just a child . Nobody will listen . But I can 't bear it . How could I forget what I did ? What we agreed ? - Did you make me forget ? - Your life is better , is it not ? - Yeah . - Then what do you want from me ? Change her back the way she was . The girl over the road , make her forget . I can 't . There is a barrier . She is protected somehow . But I can remove her for you . - No , not killing . - I cannot kill . But I can stop her from ruining your life . One night 's sleep , and you will forget her , forget me , forget everything once more . - Remove her where ? - This need not concern you . I need your agreement . Do I have your agreement ? - Yes . - It shall be arranged . But first , Andrea Yates , you must separate the child from her father . Maria , please help me . What can I do ? How do I start ? The meteor , I can 't do anything to stop it . - Why is it only me who remembers you ? - Maria , please ... - You sure you don 't mind giving me a hand ? - No . I 've got this banner for my birthday , and I want to put it up over the door . No , it 's not a problem . The least I can do . Yes ! I 've been so thick . I don 't go big on birthdays . I don 't like being the centre of attention . I used to when I was a kid . I had big birthday parties then , bouncy castles and stuff . Dad , I 've worked it out . It 's this box . It protected me . Dad ? Maria ? You okay ? Maria ? Maria ? Help ! Alan ! Alan ! Alan . - Back door was wide open . You wanna be careful . - What was that ? - What was what ? - Let 's get over to Andrea 's . - And what about Maria ? - Who ? - Ah ! Finally got yourself a new woman ? - Maria was here . I think she 's run off . Already ? Sensible woman , whoever she is . Took me 14 years . - I mean Maria , our Maria . - What do you mean , ours ? She 's our daughter . Alan , don 't start messing about . I know you wanted kids , but I never did . - As if I 've got a maternal bone in my body ! - Chrissie , stop this . Maria is our daughter . There is no Maria . Maria doesn 't exist . Ah ! What the ... Come on , it 'll be a laugh , better than that crummy museum . - But it 's dangerous , they told us not to . - You 're no fun . Candy floss . Excuse me . I 'm gonna sound mad , but where is this ? - You 've got nerve , going out dressed like that . - Don 't be so rude . You all right ? You look a bit lost . I think I am . I was in London . I 'm Maria Jackson . Pleased to meet you , Maria . I 'm Sarah Jane Smith . July 13th , 1964 . Sarah Jane , you 've got to believe me . You mustn 't go down there . I took you to aid the coming of darkness . Your life was so important and I found the right moment to snuff it out . - You were meant to die . - Meant ? Who says I 'm meant to die ? - I will return when the Earth is no more . - Don 't you dare ! Don 't you dare ! - Can you hear it ? That 's it . - Impact is due in eight minutes .

 Previously on Heroes : As long as I have breath , anything you love , I will lay to waste . Jessica wasn 't the strong one . It was you . Adam was dangerous . We locked him up , we threw away the key . Two weeks ago , he escapes , and now he wants revenge . - Who are you ? What 's your name ? - I don 't know . - Peter Petrelli ? - From N.Y. - Who 's that ? - Someone knew I was coming . - Adam doesn 't ring a bell ? - I don 't know about any company . Please tell me who I am . What the future holds . I was in Montréal , 2007 . Next thing , I 'm here . All died from the virus ? - You can change history . You must ! - I can 't . - Don 't let them take me ! - No ! Caitlin ! It is man 's ability to remember that sets us apart . Caitlin ! We are the only species concerned with the past . Our memories give us voice . They bear witness to history so that others might learn . So they might celebrate our triumphs . And be warned of our failures . Adam . Adam . I don 't know any Adam . Peter , what the hell was that ? - Do you know me ? - Of course I know you . Peter , it 's me , Adam . Don 't you remember ? Together we 're going to change history . I 'm sorry , I don 't ... So the Haitian 's taken liberties with your mind . The Haitian . That explains why you fell off the face of the earth . You can get back your memory . I know how . - How ? - Healing . You can do what I can do . Which means the mind has to repair itself . How do you suggest I go about doing that ? Think about what matters most to you . Do you know what that is ? - His name is Nathan . - Nathan ? Nathan . You saved the cheerleader so we could save the world . You gotta let me go , Nathan ! You go , I go ! No ! I 'll be OK . - You can fly , I can 't ! - What do you mean ? It 's taking everything in me , all my power not to explode ! Let me go ! Peter ! - Sanders ! Nicole Sanders ? - Here . Is my husband OK ? The bullet was less than an inch from his aorta . The surgery was successful . He 's a lucky man . Thank you . Thank you . Alejandro ! Alejandro ! No ! No . Maya ! Help ! Please help ! - Help . - Bay two is open . Keep him alive , OK ? Do whatever it takes , you understand me ? Officer ? Officer , we need your help . Did you have to use the full blast on him ? He can take it . He 's not a toy , Elle . He could be . - Where am I ? - Someplace safe . My brother ... I was in a hospital . We have the finest doctors in the world working on him . - But his situation is dire . - So who are you ? What am I doing here ? I am an old friend of your parents ' . Yeah , I 've seen you before . And , as I said before , you 're safe here . But your brother , that 's a different story . - He almost died . - Because of you , Peter . Hey , it 's not like it was your idea to go nuclear and take out half of New York City . Oh , you know about that ? Yes . As long as your abilities are in control of you , you will always be a hazard to yourself , - to your family ... - The whole world . Believe me , if I could turn them off , I would . Don 't worry , we 've done that for you . - At least for now . - How did you ... My colleague , here , is able to suppress the abilities in people around him . I don 't understand . What is this place ? You are in a facility designed to help people just like you . Peter , we can help you go back to a normal life . Thirty years ago , we had to shut down research on a vaccine which could disable your powers . But , due to recent events , we have reinstated that research . And I 'm very happy to say that we 're very close - to finding a cure for you . - Forever ? You will never have to worry about hurting anyone you love again . - How long until it 's ready ? - Good ! - You 're making the right choice . - Good boy . You have had a terrible accident . Peter ... He 's missing . He 's missing , Nathan . The coast guard is searching 100 square miles of the ocean . But you 're lucky to be alive . No . Oh , no , no , no . - Dad ! - Oh , big Teddy . - I thought I lost you . - Girl , I told you . You 're never getting rid of me . Mrs Sanders ... - I 'll be right back , OK ? - I 'll be here . Dr Brooks . Um , I wanted you to know that we don 't have insurance . But I 'm sure that we can come up ... You don 't have to worry about that . It 's all been taken care of . I don 't understand . How ? Who paid ? Uh , that 'd be me . - Do I know you ? - Call me Bob . Did you happen to see a morning newspaper ? What ? No , why ? Not a mention of what happened last night on Kirby Plaza . Or the untimely death of our friend Mr Linderman . - Who the hell are you ? - Someone who wants to help . Linderman made a mess of things , and I 'm here to right the ship . - So to speak . - OK . You 've done that by paying our bills . No , I meant helping you with your illness . - I know you think Jessica is gone . - How do you know about that ? We 've discovered that when these abilities manifest , the way the mind deals with the new reality sometimes results in a fracture of sorts . - A split personality . - No , I 'm finished with Jessica . How do you know a new personality won 't emerge ? I can get you all the help you need . The best care in the world . Uh-huh . What 's the catch ? The catch is you have to leave your family and enter the programme . I just went through hell to get my family back together . I 'm not leaving them now . There is medication you can try at home , but ... - But what ? - It 's not without side effects . And as you just said , you 've been through so much for your family . Do you really wanna risk losing them all again ? - So I just take these pills every day ? - Yep . It 's a little cocktail they cooked up here in the lab . It controls the abilities . Dampens them . Like that guy who was standing in the corner of Bob 's office . The Haitian . Yeah ... Sorta . So let 's just call them Haitian pills . - Bye , Peter . - Ow ! That hurts . You 'll get used to it . And then you 'll start to like it . - Hello ? - Who said that ? Me . All right ! Eleven years old . Almost the man of the house now . Mom ? Did you make a wish , baby ? Don 't tell us , you know it 's not gonna come true . You both know what I wished for , anyways . - Micah , we 've been over this . - But I 've got it all figured out . I 'd make the car radio pick up the police band . Go to the crime scene and be heroes . Or the police could just take care of it . We could be like The Fantastic Four . Minus one . But still . Micah , I wanna be a hero to you . And I finally figured out how to do that . I think I got a job . A good job . - What ? - Something that 's gonna make you proud of me , I promise . Come on . I promised I 'd take you bowling , right ? Let 's go . - Mom , you coming ? - Your mom 's had a long day , Micah . Go get your jacket . All I want is to smile at my boy on his birthday , and I can 't even do that . They said it 's gonna take a little while for the medication to level out . I just don 't know how much longer I can do this . I wanna say things 'll get better . But I know how that sounds . But the truth is , they will . You know , it 's been a month . You still haven 't told me your name . Please , I just wanna be left alone . You came to the right place . I have to warn you , though , it does get a bit old . Let me guess . You were living a perfectly ordinary life . Until one day you discovered you could do incredible things . I bet it was wonderful at first . You thought , perhaps , you could save the world . And then you realised , tragically , that you were dangerous . I 'll let you talk to me after a decade . Oh , actually , talk to me after three . If they wanna leave me in here forever , that 's fine by me . You 've been through something awful , haven 't you ? I 'm sorry . I 'm Peter . Hello , Peter . It 's nice to meet you . I 'm Adam . I 'm not in the mood today , Elle . Just a little one ? I 'll up your dose . I 'm fine . Just a little one . Oh ! Not that a fistful of pills everyday isn 't fun , but ... It 's been two months and I don 't know a thing about you . I was thinking , maybe , there 's more to you than the whole sadistic lightning thing , that 's all . What 's your story ? I liked you better when you just laid there . So you 're not gonna tell me ? What are you , afraid ? No . You just like to be in control . I get it . I figured as much . Sorry I asked . Won 't happen again . I accidentally set my grandmother 's house on fire when I was six . Caused a blackout in four counties in Ohio when I was eight . I spent my ninth birthday in a glass room with an IV of lithium in my arm . I 've lived in this building for 16 years . Ever since the shrinks diagnosed me as a sociopath with paranoid delusions . But they were just out to get me because I threatened to kill ' em . I 'm 24 years old , and I 've never gone on a date . Never been on a roller coaster . Never been swimming . And now you know everything there is to know about me . I don 't have the luxury of being more interesting than that . Later , alligator . Word to the wise , friend . I would keep my distance from that one . I caved in a desperate moment six years ago , and I 'm still paying the price . Don 't worry . I don 't want anything from her except the drugs . I 'm sorry , I keep forgetting . You still believe them . - What do you mean ? - This cure of theirs . They 've been days away from perfecting it since I got here 30 years ago . - Bob 's not trying to fix you , Peter . - No . - They created this facility to help us . - You 're not in a facility , Peter . Look around . You 're in a prison . You don 't believe me ? Why don 't you try getting out ? Oh , I 'm sorry . - Are you all right ? - He said it was all a lie . What happened to him and to Peter ... and the car crash . I take it he told you he thought he could fly . And the plot to blow up New York . That Peter was a bomb . It must be the pain medication . You deserve to know this . I tried to keep it from you and the boys . What ? There 's a dark secret in the Petrelli family . It started with their father . Delusions of grandeur , paranoia . It lead to his suicide . But , sadly , that disease has obviously been passed down . My God . Now ... Nathan 's a great man . And his life is gonna be very complicated . He really deserves his dignity and his ... his privacy . So I hope you understand that this has to be kept secret . Can I count on you for that , Heidi ? Hi , what can I do to get you inside a ... Hi ... Hi ... What can I do to get you into a brand new car ? Hi , what can I do ... Depends on what you 're gonna do to me once you get me inside . I got a great feeling about your first day . My butterflies have butterflies . Nik , I am so proud of you . I knew that medication would work out . - You were right . - I 'm gonna take Micah to school . - OK . - You have a great day at work . And when I get home , tonight , we 're gonna celebrate . He 's gonna know you 're not taking the stupid pills . Go away , Jessica . I don 't need you anymore . What makes you think this is Jessica ? Remember me ? That summer that you ran away to LA and told everyone to call you Gina ? - You 're not real . - Oh , you 're gonna sell cars ? - I 'm going back to LA to go play . - No , I 'm in control . If I can handle Jessica , I can handle you . Then why aren 't you taking your meds ? No ! No ! No ! No ! Look , I need to see my family . Just for a day or two . Yes , I think that would be absolutely possible . - Just not right now . - Why not ? They don 't even know I 'm alive . Look , I could let you go , and you could explode again . You could blow up half the east coast . Dose me with some drugs and I 'll be back before they wear off . - It 's perfectly safe . - I 'm sorry , Peter . - You 're not ready for that . - So send someone out with me . - Elle , maybe . - Uh , no . No , no , I 'm sorry , Peter . Um , that 's just not gonna happen . I 'm never getting out of here , am I ? Suddenly the room starts to feel like a cage . I don 't understand . If they 're not gonna help us , why are we here ? - To keep us from being out there . - Why , because we 're dangerous ? No , Peter , it 's because we could save the world . Years ago , I tried to take my abilities public . I thought that if everyone knew that my blood had curing powers , - I could help . How naive I was . - That 's why they put you in here . Well , if it were possible to kill me , they would have , I assure you . Instead , I 'm locked up in here . When I could be curing your brother . Nathan . How ? Just a small amount of my blood could help to heal him . End his pain . Even after everything you 've put him through . So how do we get out ? My daughter is still in there ! Please ! Please ! Hawkins ! Hawkins , get out of there ! Please ! Mommy ! Mommy ! - Mommy ! - Thank you . - Yeah , good one , D.L. - Good job ! This is KCEI , Channel Nine News , reporting on a house fire we 've heard , in the Clark County district . Near tragedy was avoided ... - Dad ! - Hey . I saw you on TV ! They keep on playing it over and over ! - You really are a hero . - I guess I am . Where 's your mom ? I don 't think she 's gotten home from work yet . Jessica . You 're not gonna give me a little jolt ? Why , you want one ? Like you said , I 'm starting to like ' em . Starting to like you . Fine , since you asked nicely . Ah ! Enough fun for one day ? Day number five without the meds . Then I think it 's time to try . Come on , Peter . You can do it . It 's nice to finally meet you . You know , for 400 years , you 've held up pretty well . Come on , let 's go heal your brother . Excuse me , chief . I 'm looking for this girl . - She 's over there . - Thanks . - Jessica ! - Guess again . - Dude , the chick doesn 't know you . - She 's my wife . This is us . Stay out of this . Come on , man . - Where am I ? - Let 's go . - Where am I ? - We 're going home . How did you find me ? I told you , you ain 't getting rid of me . I love you , baby . Not as much as I love you . - Hey ! - Man , let it go . We 're leaving , all right ? Can I play with it ? Damon , come on . Why would you ask him that ? Don 't be so silly . You 're gonna be all right , aren 't you , sugar ? I don 't know . I think I need to get some help . Anything you want , you just gotta ask . - You know that , don 't you ? - Thank you . I 've taken care of everything . Plane tickets , money . Now this . I 'm so sorry , Nathan . How long until it starts working ? Don 't have time to find out . They 're going to assume that you 'll come to see your brother . First place they 'll look . - Come on . - Adam , look , look , look ! Good . Come on . Come on . Incredible . His skin was starting to heal right there in front of us . As good as new by the time he wakes up . Here , passport . Plane ticket . - Here 's the plan . - You disappointed me , Peter . Just when I thought we were getting to know each other . There 's a warehouse in Montréal . 121 Rue Saint-Jacques . Meet there . Ugh ! Go after him ! You take me back there , I 'm gonna keep escaping . I 'm not taking you back . You deserve a better fate . - Your mother helped when I was in need . - So now you 're helping me ? You must start a new life , Peter . I fear this is the only solution . Your secret is safe with me . Go with God , my friend . What ? ! There are many ways to define our fragile existence . Many ways to give it meaning . But it is our memories that shape its purpose and give it context . A private assortment of images , fears , loves , regrets . - Thank you . - Yeah . For it is the cruel irony of life that we are destined to hold the dark with the light , the good with the evil . Success with disappointment . This is what separates us , what makes us human . And , in the end , what we must fight to hold on to . I remember . I remember everything . Good , then . Shall we save the world ?

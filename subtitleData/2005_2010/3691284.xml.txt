 So what kind of artifact could cause a gas explosion ? I thought we were gonna get a break . Did you ask Artie ? Yeah , he laughed for about five minutes . I guess that 's an answer . You know , I 'm not asking for two weeks in Tahiti , you know ? I just want a couple days to get out of Podunk Dakota and go someplace that serves martini . Well , you are looking pretty ragged ... You got those bags under your eyes and ... wha ... I 'm ... I 'm supporting you here . It 's very helpful . Thanks . Ow . Secret service . That 's a big-ass generator , huh ? I count six body bags . Excuse me , can I see this body , please ? Oh , God . Kentucky fried , extra crispy . Thank you . Can I help you ? Hi , I 'm , um , Agent Bering . This is Agent Lattimer . Captain Powell , eastern division . Secret service ? So what went down here last night ? Underground gas main ruptured . It ignited . City engineers are checking to see if it 's safe to go down there . Until then , that 's all I know . Thanks for stopping by . Hmm . I think I have more questions . You ? Let 's go meet the engineer . Let 's . Hello ? Hey . It 's us again . Uh , look , general , I 'm gonna need a list of all the casualties and a list of all the witnesses to the accident . Well , it 's pretty much the same lit ... half a dozen suspects , hadn 't even been processed yet . We 're still trying to confirm the I.Ds. And I wasn 't here , but a desk sergeant and a duty officer got knocked out by the blast . One 's comatose , and the other one 's in surgery . I 'm sorry to hear that . Good . So maybe now you 'll let me get to the ton of paperwork I have ahead of me . Hey . So , uh ... What do you think ? Is it safe to go down there ? Yeah . There 's not much to see , but it appears to be structurally sound . Mm . Uh ... it 's dark . Thanks . Okay . So this must 've been a cellar they sealed up when they built the police station . Uh-huh . Huh . You got a vibe ? No . Something else happened . Check this out . The explosion must 've blown this door open . Huh . Pete ? Wow . I guess he 's been down here quite a while . Yeah . Here 's his wallet . Secret service . Myka . Uh-huh . This guy was a warehouse agent . Look , he has a secret service tar , but his I.D. and his credentials are dust . I 'm sending for the body right now , okay ? And meanwhile , what I want you to do is to get me pictures . Meanwhile , I am gonna find who this agent is . I 'll I.D. him , and I will find out , if I can , what mission he was on . It looks like the blast opened up the wall , and somehow people were fried . I mean , could an artifact cause an explosion like that ? Or did the explosion release the artifact and then burn everybody up ? Yeah , well , that is a very good question , Pete , very good question . That 's exactly what you have to figure out . Bye . How the hell ... how the hell ... am I gonna figure out ... who that mysterious agent is ? Unfortunately , the warehouse filing system never quite caught up to the computer age . Like your wardrobe ? What ? These are earth stones . They never go out of style . The files on all the warehouse agents for the last 200 years , give or take , and missing agent , too , somewhere . Excellent . You can teach me about scrapbooking . Yeah , okay , I 'll call you if I need you . All right , all right , I got my own stuff . Besides , I 'm allergic to old . Hey , Myka just sent pics from the scene . Yeah , no , we 're getting the actual body later today , so we don 't need that digital crap . Digital 's just as good , Artie . No , you know what ? Welcome to the new millennium . Pixel will never replace the real thing . Pixel ... you know what they are ? They 're just ... Look , they 're a start , but they 're ... God , they 're a really small start . Oh , but they don 't have to be . What ? Oh , they can be so much more . I 've been working on something , okay ? I really want to how you . No , no , I really , really don 't need any kind of newfangled ... Chill . This is totally old-fangled . Check it out . What ... What ... What is ... I that ... is that ... part of that a Bell Howell spectroscope ? Surprise . I repurposed it . What , without asking me ? What ... it 's just a hologram projector . It 's perfectly safe . Now , behold ... No , no , I don 't need to behold . Can we behold a whole other time ? See , I 've composited all of Myka 's picture and ... Wait , no . No , no , no , hold on . No , I know this works . Yeah , I 'm sure it 's fabulous . Can we just do this at a more appropriate ... Percussive maintenance . Wait , it gets better . What did you ... What did you do ? I upgraded the whole megillah . Strung together a bunch of haswells on a ray xt backbone I found in the warehouse . I mean , I guess keeping me around here wasn 't the worst idea you ever had . What is that ? Is that a ... Tattoo on what 's left of his skin there ? Could be . Yeah , but I ca ... can you zoom in on that a little bit ? Okay , yeah . Yeah , I can 't ... I can 't ... could you digitally reconstruct that ? Couldn 't any genius whiz kid ? Okay , you do that . I 'll be in the records room . Oh , God . " Really , good , brilliant job , Claudia . Love the initiative . " " Oh , thank you . Thanks , Artie . " So ... Nothing on the tapes . Like I said . You know , I 'm really enjoying our time together . These are the personal effects from the suspects who died in the accident , right ? Yeah , and processing them is a very low priority right now . Yeah , but whoever started the job put out seven trays . Yeah ? But there were only six bodies . Son of a bitch . Son of a bitch . Everybody , drop what you 're doing right now . Which means we might have a survivor or a witness . Or a guy with an artifact that , um , fries people . Reggie Hinton , where are you now ? Give me some of that . Reggie ? Shut up . We got to get out of here , y 'all , now . He 's coming after us , all of us . Who is ? Just come on , yo . We got to get out of here now . Reggie ! Let 's go . Wait , Reggie ! It 's him . It 's consistent with a fast , hot fire ... the same as the bodies at the station . Except this time no gas leak . It 's like they were microwaved . We I.D. ' d this one as Reggie Hinton , your suspect . What killed these guys ? Why is this ... Not ... Okay , uh , it 's an eagle ... Yeah . And an anchor ... Uh-huh . And just a circle , I guess . Could it be a globe ? Yeah , why not ? Okay , so eagle , anchor , globe ... He 's a marine . He 's a marine . That 's gonna narrow it down . I mean , there 's only like a dozen or so agents who were former marines . You know , we ... we could ... Yeah ? There are more bodies . They 're burnt to a crisp again , but there 's still no sign of an actual fire . No fire ? Wait a minute . No fire . Okay , so there was , uh ... there was ... there was a Babylonian battery . It was unearthed and then lost again in 1952 in Texas , not Missouri . But there was also a rumor that Edward Teller was working on a micro-fission thing , But I don 't think it 's that . Well , here 's a wrinkle . There 's a handprint on the bodies . It 's the only part not burned , and our only suspect was one of the victims . It was like he was , I don 't know , followed from the police station , Artie . Oh , no , not like he was followed . He was chased . I don 't think that these deaths are random . So maybe somebody at the station last night found the artifact , whatever it is , and used it to settle some old scores . Yeah , okay , you know what ? You trace the victims . You see if they 've got any enemies , then maybe you can get ahead of this guy before he settles more ... scores . Okay ? Bye . Yeah , if that 's what it was , which I really doubt . Would it have killed you to leave a note ? Captain Powell . Yes ? Did you know that every one of these burn victims were members of the same gang ? And they were brought in the other night after an altercation with a rival gang . I mean , could this be payback ? It 's just what we need ... a turf war with a new kind of weapon in play . Okay , we 're gonna need , um , names , addresses , whatever you 've got . The head of our gang unit , Sergeant Clark , is out on leave . As soon as I get in touch with him , I will put him through to you . And this is Clark , huh ? Till then , this is his latest stuff . Will you need a blue-and-white escort ? No , no . We can handle it . Good , ' cause I really can 't spare one . I think he 's starting to warm up to us , you know , a little . Mm . I can 't ... it 's not ... Your uncle staying the weekend or just the night ? Yeah , he just arrived . This is actually the missing agent . It 's a little bit better than hologram or pixel , isn 't it ? If you 're into that kind of thing . Yeah , well , you know , I 'm trying to scan it with this dingus you made . I can 't connect it with the ... Hold on . May I ? Seriously . Yeah , what ? Just do that , but go lower . All right , wow me with your 3-d . Okay , I don 't appreciate the tone , young man . A little peed would be good . People are actually dying . Yeah , go . Nice . Okay , this is what I 'm saying . Wow . Okay , so ... He 's kind of cute for an old-timey guy . Okay . Okay . No , no ... No , no ... Welcome back to the warehouse ... Jack Secord . Uh , joined the marines in ' 48 , recruited to the warehouse in ' 55 . Last known location , Minneapolis . That 's a long way from St. Louis , Louis . 5 . 8 . 4 ? 5 . Here , put these on . Oh , what , are we going into surgery ? Ah , just do as you 're told , please . Okay . Oh , Jack Secord ... living quarters , personal effects , sealed 6 / 22 ? 2 . Holy bed-and-breakfast , Batman . Mm-hmm . This is Leena 's . No , this is the warehouse , but , yes , it is room 5 of the bed-and-breakfast , but it 's still the warehouse . See , whenever a warehouse agent ... if he disappears , if he dies , if he dies , espec ... Hey , are you listening to me ? Yeah . If he dies mysteriously , then , you know , living quarters , personal effects ... they 're collected . They 're preserved right here . So he smoked ... a lot . Hey , it was the ' 60s . Everybody smoked . What 's this ? What ? " I 'll be in town a few days . Until then ... " Are there envelopes ? No . So there 's no addresses ? No , maybe he thought somebody was reading his mail . Well , you know , it was the cold war . Probably somebody was reading his mail , but girlfriends weren 't against the rules , unless ... Wait , girlfriends ? Yeah , it 's female writing , see ? You can still smell the perfume . Oh , so is that like an old-school booty call ? Yeah , before there was texting , grasshopper , there was a time when people actually did put pen to p ... You know what ? That 's the ticket . Here . You know , it 's not what he got . It 's what he actually ... wrote . The indentations ... left behind ... Oh , sweet . Yeah , a product of a misspent youth . And that is ... who 's that ? Rebecca . And where do you live , Rebecca ? Is that " St. Louis " ? Yeah . St. Louis , wow . What do you know , Jack Secord ? You actually did leave a note . Rad . Rebecca St. Clair ? I 'm Agent Lattimer . This is Agent Bering . We 're with the secret service . Oh , my . How can I help you ? Um , would you mind if we came inside ? Well , sure . Thank you . Ma 'am , we 're just in the middle of an investigation , and a , um , body was found today . A body ? Yes . In the personal effects of the deceased was this address . Oh , my God . You found Jack . So you knew him ? Jack Secord , yes . I knew him quite well . Where did you find him ? Well , he was , uh ... he was sealed up underground . We 're very sorry . Do you remember if he mentioned any strange occurrences before he went missing ? Jack really didn 't talk about his work . Is this connected with that awful thing that happened at the police station ? No . Yes . We 're really not at liberty to say , but if you have anything , if ... if you know anything , no matter how seemingly insignificant , it would be very helpful . Would you like some tea and cookies ? No . Yes , please . Yeah , ple ... I ... yeah , uh , I just ... I love cookies . He does . Uh , let me put on a kettle . Okay . Thank you , thank you . Thank you . What are you doing ? Uh , establishing a rapport , you know , making her feel comfortable . I think she knows something . I that a vibe , or do I hear your stomach growling ? I haven 't eaten since last night , okay ? Unbelievable . Unbelievable . Oh , those ... they look great . Thank you . Ooh . The tea will be here in a minute . Uh , I 'd just like to ask you ... when his body was found , was there anything strange about ... Agent Bering . What ? When ? What 's the address ? Thank you . Pete ... it happened again . Same conditions ? Uh-huh . Okay. uh , I 'm sorry , ma 'am , but we 've got to go . Thank you so much for everything . Uh , I 'm ... I 'm sorry . Just got to have a little ... have a little ... Pete , don 't take them all . Okay , that ... that one is ... these ... have more people been electrocuted ? Listen , we 're very sorry , but we really can 't talk about it . Thank you . Thank you . Let go of me . Don 't touch me , you stupid pig . Just don 't kill me . Okay , look , we 're not here to hurt you , okay ? We just want to ask you a few questions . No , the cops that killed him are gonna kill me too . What do you mean " like him " ? Like who ? The killer guy . Are you saying a cop did this ? 5-0 walked straight up and started burning people . I was just over there . I don 't know . It was crazy . What 's going on ? Who 's this ? It 's a witness , and he says a cop did this . Yeah ? They never say that . He 's probably covering for a gang he wants to join . Hey , get the hell out of here . Look , have all of your officers checked in after the explosion ? No , but only Clark is out , the head of the gang unit . Why ? 'Cause he needed to decompress . He lost his temper in an interrogation . So these bodies , these ... these gang members fall under his jurisdiction ? Well , of course , but like I said , he 's on R R. He 's on R R , right . Could we get his address ? We could use his expertise . Give me a second . So the volatile lead of the gang unit is on mandated leave . While gang member get mysteriously killed by what looks to be a cop . What do you think ... two plus two equals four ? Have you ever stopped by the office on your day off ? No , but I 'm sure you have . Mm , Sergeant Clark and I call it dedication . You hear that ? Look at that . Sergeant Clark , federal agents ! Open up ! One , two , three , go . Sergeant Clark ? Hey , hey , hey , hey . Clark ! Oh , my God , what is that ? Clark , no ! Come on . He went down here . There ! He 's dead . Help me . Oh . That thing ... it 's gone . Okay , just tell me that Clark 's body is on the way to me right now . No , Powell took it . Oh , for God ... you know , I ... I just don 't have time to play bureaucracy games to get it back ! I sent you a bunch of pictures that Claudia asked for . Yeah , great , pictures . Got them . Look , there was something on his back , Artie , some kind of a nasty , metallic lobster-looking thingy , and it 's gone now . Okay , so maybe , you know , if we find out what that thingy was , then we can track where it went . And you say that it also leaves a body when the body dies , maybe . Okay , that 's a good start . Please , tell me that you have something else . Well , it looked like it was fused to his back . Ho ... hold ... hold it . I got an idea . Yes , we 'll do it right now . Now , come on , come on . Ohhhhh . Right . Right away , just do it . One , two , three . Ugh . Go do your thing . Do your thing . All right , talk to me . It gave off arches of electricity . It must be how he burned those people . You got it ? Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . All right . So , uh , the electricity ... Did it emanate from Clark or from the artifact ? Both . Okay , you know what ? So that just completely eliminate our last possibility . All right , just ... did it have buttons ? Did it have wires ? Did it have an antenna ? Hey , Artie . Yeah . Digital rendering shows Jack had something on his back too . Okay , just , uh ... All right , can you guys hear me ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay , attached to the vertebra at t-2 , 4 7 , and 9 and accessed the spinal cord , I think . I can 't really tell . Listen to me . Jack Secord , when he died , did not just have this artifact with him . He had it on him . I mean , this thing was like some kind of a ... it 's like a parasite . Well , dude , Ripley 's believe it or not ... same markings on Clark 's back . All right , did you get that ? Clark 's back too . So what powers it , Artie ? I mean , it must be drawing electricity from somewhere to electrocute people the way it did . Yeah , okay , I 'll just add that to our already-huge list of questions . Thank you . All right , goodbye . What ? Why are you making that face ? What ? What are you ... you got something ? Electrocution ... That 's the word Rebecca used , but we didn 't know it did that yet . We hadn 't figured it out . Oh . Mm-hmm . I see more cookies in my future . Of course you do . I don 't know what you 're talking about . You asked if there were any more electrocutions . What exactly did you mean by that ? I heard it on the news . No , it was never mentioned in the news . Ma 'am , you know more than you 're saying . Okay , let 's cut to the chase , shall we ? You didn 't come in from D.C. The unexplained electrocutions raised a flag . You found Jack , and you finally figured out there was an artifact . You 're from South Dakota , right ? This artifact that Jack was hunting for before he disappeared ... it 's active again . Am I correct ? You weren 't just his girlfriend . You 're a warehouse agent . Welcome to the conversation . Okay , come here . I mean ... Ew . This is it . Oh , that 's a definitely a nasty lobster-looking thing . and what is ... That 's electrocution , right ? Yeah . Yeah . Wait , what was that writing ? This one . Okay , see , this ... this writing ... is very ... old . I have no idea what that writing is . Well , you want me to , uh , you know , scan it in , do my thing ? You go , girl . Don 't . Sorry . That 's wrong . Yeah . Uh , you left before I could be certain you were warehouse . I wanted to share this with you ... what I dug up back then , what I think Jack was following . There 'd been several unexplained deaths , burned bodies . It started at a museum shortly after an 11h-century exhibit passed through . I couldn 't find a connection , but Jack had vibe about these things ... Very annoying . He must 've started to investigate , and then ... then he just disappeared . I always knew if we didn 't quit , one of us , one day , would lose the other . But for Jack , the warehouse was his first love . Till death do them part . I scoured the crime scenes , but I never found any answers . You never went back to the warehouse ? I couldn 't do that . Changed my last name , just disappeared . I stayed in St. Louis , hoping to find him one day ... maybe lost , confused . Eventually my life was here . Myka . Does this look familiar to you ? That 's what we saw on ... on Clark 's back . That 's ... that 's the device . That 's Jack 's handwriting . Jack knew what he was looking for . Are you still using that old thing ? Yeah , right ? Okay , can you see this ? This is what you 're looking for . It 's called " the spine of the Saracen . " Oh , okay , great . Uh , so it has a name ? What is a Saracen ? A Saracen 's a Turk . Now , listen , there 's a legend that during the first crusade , The Turks had this elite warrior cult , and these warriors were rumored to be unstoppable for some reason in the field of battle . What I 'm thinking is that the spine ... Can you see this ? The spine was specifically designed as a weapon for these warriors . 11th century ... it 's the same as the museum exhibit . What exhibit ? Well , we found pictures too . Uh , something happened at a museum exhibit that Jack Secord stumbled on . Rebecca showed us this . So maybe this thing was sealed and it got out somehow . Okay , so if we find it , how can we stop it ? Yeah , okay , well , I 'm deciphering the text right now . It 's a little difficult , but I 'm trying . It 's the words under this drawing , and loosely translated , it says , " the spine requires a lifetime commitment . " Oh , yeah , man , I had a girlfriend like that once . So ... so this thing must get its power from somewhere , right ? So if we shut down it course , can we stop it ? Yeah , well , you know , when I figure it out , you know what ? You 'll be the second to know . So this ... this spine ... You know , it 's probably still at Clark 's apartment . So we should get there before somebody else finds it . Now , Jack was a very good agent , the best . You be careful . Yeah , we will . Okay , so the last time we saw Clark alive , he ran into this alley , so we should start here ? Well , unless you want to look under the arch . Aah ! Help ! What is that ? Help me ! Help me ! Hey ! Hey , hey , hold it ! Hold it ! Hold it ! He 's trying to kill me ! Bring the gun here . I shot him . I shot him in the chest , and he just kept coming at me . Who are you talking about ? Oh , God . Okay , now would be a good time to take the shot . Okay , that didn 't work . Pete ! No , but the good news is , we 've pissed him off . Okay , stop it ! We 're on your side ! Please help me . Please help me . God . Oh , God . Vince . What happened ? I he ... He 's gone . He was my ex-husband . There was a restraining order , but I 've never seen him ... Wait . It 's gone . But how ? Ma 'am , get out of the area now . Now ! Pete ! Do you see it ? No . Do you ? No . Look out ! Pete ! Pete ! Pete ! Pete , what 's going ... Pete , don 't move ! I 'm okay . Okay , just let me call Artie . All right , just let me ... No , stay away ! I don 't want to hurt yo ... Agent Bering . Agent Bering . Agent Bering . Are you okay ? Where 's Pete ? I don 't know , he 's not here . What happened ? The same thing that happened to Clark and Jack , it 's happening to Pete . I ... I have to go find him . Hang on one second . You were knocked out . We need to call an ambulance . I 'm fine , okay ? Just ... just excuse me . I have to go . The spine was designed for one thing . It turns a person into a killing machine . It 's a warrior-maker . It uses the body like a big battery , heightening and redirecting the host 's natural electrical impulses . Yeah , it 's like ancient pcp . It jacks up your adrenaline and testosterone . So on a scale of 1 to 10 , you 're about a 25 . Until the battery I drained and the barbs retract . It lies dormant just waiting for the next nearest living hot to latch onto . Artie , the spine is on Pete . Okay , where is he right now ? I don 't know . Just tell me that you can remove it . We will , we will . There 's a way . There 's always a way , Myka . Artie , listen to me , I can 't , um ... I will not lose another partner . Just the look in Pete 's eye . Artie , he looked ... I 've never seen him so angry . That 's not Pete . That 's the artifact . It just ... it feeds on aggression . It makes you go after what you hate , right ? Clark went after the gangs , and the last victim went after his ex-wife . A warrior that 's been programmed to kill his enemies . Jack fought it . He fought his feelings long enough so that he could seal himself up and not hurt anyone . What are you saying , Myka ? You think Pete is gonna do exactly the same thing ? I don 't know . Artie , what do I do when I find him ? What have you got ? Claudia , just tell me anything you 've got . Okay , hold up , so when this thing was built , electricity didn 't exist yet , right ? So it 'd zap people , but what would happen if it got zapped ? I mean , that 's what the bolt of lightning was in the picture that they found . Remember , Jack wrote ... Hand of God . Maybe that 's what shuts down the spine , a bolt of lightning . Overwhelming the spine 's receptors might make it automatically detach . That 's not bad . Just turn the Tesla power to full . No , Artie , look , we already tried that . All right , listen , Myka , find Pete . Your Tesla not strong enough , so you 'll have to find a powerful electrical source Somehow , somewhere . He 's gonna take a bullet . What ? That 's what we 're trained to do , isn 't it ? Every secret service agent will take the bullet for the president , for his country . That 's what Jack did . He sacrificed himself . That 's what Pete 's going to do now . No , because Pete ... Pete knows that the spine will just latch on to another person . Then he 's going to make sure . That 's what Jack did . Agent Bering , your partner Lattimer , two of my men just saw him headed back to the station house . What ... why would he ... The generator . He 's found his bolt of lightning . Lattimer . Lattimer ! Stop . Get out ! Powell , wait ! Wait . Look , it channels anger . Okay , you have to go outside . Please , just go . Pete , it 's gonna be okay . Okay , Artie can fix this . The spine require a lifetime commitment . You can 't help me . Yes , I can , okay ? You just ... you just have to ... No ! I can feel it . This thing is stronger than I am . I don 't think I can fight it much longer . Yes , you can . Yes , you can . Okay , we can find a solution . We can lock you up until we find an answer . Like Jack ? Buried for all those years to have that thing come back to life ? No ! It 's gotta end here . I have to die . And I have to take the spine with me . You understand , right ? Pete . Take these ... and clamp them to the spine . I tried , but I ... I can 't reach . If I miss , I 'll just kill myself and it will attach to its next victim . Myka , you 've got to do this . Pete , I can 't . Please ! Please . Pete , listen to me . Pete ! You will come back . Do you hear me ? You will . Do it . Oh , God ! Oh , God . Come on . Damn it . Come on , Pete . Don 't leave . Come on , Pete . Come on ! Don 't leave ! Oh , God . Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm okay . Oh , God . Man , this trip really killed me . Would you not ... could you stop that , please ? Seriously , I am totally dead . Hey , I 'm surprised to see you alive . Don 't encourage him . I have but one life to live for my ... Oh , no , wait . All right , you know how I felt when you were actually close to ... Artie ... So when you ... Oh . This is Rebecca . Right , right . Wow . This is quite an honor . Hello , I 'm Artie . Hello . I wanted to be 100 % certain that this thing would never again see the light of day . Absolutely . I can take care of that . Place hasn 't hanged very much . Yeah . Oh , I 'm working on that . Claudia Donovan . Warehouse 13 : next generation . Thank you very much , Claudia . Thanks . Thank you . So I was wondering , we could always use an extra pair of hands . Use ... that 's the perfect word . Like I said , this place hasn 't changed very much . And it never will . It hate to let go of anything . Thank you , but no thank you . I came here to complete Jack 's mission . Now I 'm going home . I understand . Oh , right . Rebecca , just ... there is one last thing that you might be interested in seeing . Just like he left it . Hmm . His lucky lighter . Oh . Um ... Rebecca , there 's something in here in Jack 's desk that Claudia found that obviously belongs to you , so ... Oh . " Rebecca and Jack ... together forever . " Yeah , I 'm gonna give you a minute here . I guess Jack hose you over the warehouse after all . Get out of here while you have time , while you still have a life left to live . This place , it 's like the , um , the spine . It 'll use you up .

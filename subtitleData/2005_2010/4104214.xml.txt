 Olivia Dunham , Charlie Francis , FBI . Previously on Fringe : You had no choice . Whatever that was , it wasn 't Charlie . - You 've been through quite an ordeal . - What 's this ? Sam Weiss , the man who helped put me back together . Take the shoes off now . - I just got here . - Come back tomorrow . By then I 'll have found you the perfect bowling ball . I was told that you could fix me . Take care , Agent Dunham . We 're closed . I think I owe you a thank-you . I got my memories back from the accident . So I figured I wouldn 't be needing these . Who died ? You and your partner , Charlie , were pretty close , huh ? I guess getting your memory back wasn 't your only problem . Oh , of course I have problems but the problems I have , I can handle . Yeah , sure you can . You know , if you ask me , what you need right now is something to help you with everything you 've been going through . Something to help you make sense of it all . - Like bowling ? - Well , what do you know ? She makes a joke . No , I got another project for you . Yes , like bowling , you 're gonna think I 'm full of it but here 's the thing , Olivia . Whether you admit it or not your life is something of a nightmare . I hope you don 't have anything against the color red . Jeez , Greg , Carl 's really pissed off at you . What did you do , man ? You better get in there . I 'm going . Finally . We 've been waiting . Are you okay ? Don 't worry , whatever happened , we 'll take care of it . It will all go away . Leiter ! You know how much trouble you 've caused me ? I am going to destroy you . What the hell ? Greg , are you crazy ? [ SCREAMS - Oh , you can bring that in here , please . - Hang on . Walter . - What are you doing ? - I 'm making my bed . I 've got a fireplace to keep me warm and if I get hungry in the night , the kitchen is only 13 steps away which is a prime number and a sign of good fortune . You know that you have a bedroom , right ? Upstairs . Oh , I know what you 're thinking . Don 't worry , son . I promise to wear my shorts to bed so if you bring any young ladies home there won 't be any embarrassing moments . Knock , knock ! Agent Farnsworth . Welcome to our new home . - Thank you . - Oh . Oh , a housewarming ... . I love presents . - Hey . - Walter , come on . Italian ciabatta bread ? - Very impressive , Walter . - Yes . It 's for good luck . - I brought something for you too . - Oh , you shouldn 't have . Agent Dunham sent this over . A man kills his boss , doesn 't remember and then he has this really crazy thing with his eyes . It says there 's video surveillance . I saw it . Whatever was happening to that man , it wasn 't normal . - Do I eat it or keep it ? - I suppose whichever you 'd like . Pack a bag , Walter . We 're going to Seattle . Thank you . There you go . Do you have a card ? In case we need a ride while we 're in town . Thank you . Thanks for coming out . We brought Mr. Leiter here around 6 last night . We haven 't managed to get anything out of him . - He hasn 't been cooperative ? - He hasn 't been responsive . - We only just managed to wake him up . - Wait . - He 's been asleep for 16 hours ? - Like he was drugged . The doctors only managed to wake him up a few minutes ago . Peter , I don 't wanna go in there . I 'd rather stay out here . Sure . Can you tell us what happened , Mr. Leiter ? It doesn 't make sense . I remember driving to work from lunch , pulling into the garage . And then I was on the floor in Carl Langdon 's office . They were holding me down . And there 's nothing else that you remember from yesterday ? Nothing unusual ? - You 're gonna think I 'm crazy . - Try me . The office ... . It was like the office was infiltrated by these creatures . And Carl , he was their leader . He had horns like some demon . I know , it sounds nuts . Almost like I 'm dreaming , like it was ... . Mr. Leiter ? - Mr. Leiter ? - Walter . What is it ? - Greg ? - Can 't go in , Mrs. Leiter . What 's happening to him ? - Greg ! - Mrs. Leiter , please . No . Oh , my God . Oh , my God , no . Greg . No ! No ! That 's odd . He 's warm . He should be cooler by now . The oven . - I think we forgot to turn it off at home . - We 've never even turned it on . You sure ? We never turned the oven on , we did not leave the front door unlocked and the toaster is not gonna burn the house . What 's going on ? You 've been acting weird . My apologies , we 're waiting on the tox screen . But the blood CBC is- - Severe thyroxine deficit , curiously high levels of adrenal hormones ? How did you know that ? Shock-induced achromotrichia and hyperkeratotic skin lesions and clear signs of dehydration . It seems that this man died of acute exhaustion . That doesn 't make any sense . - Human beings can 't die of- - - Not that we 're aware of , no . But it has been documented in rats . I need this body taken back to my lab . - Your lab ? - In Boston , Massachusetts . Walter , whatever you need , I 'm sure they have it here . Would you excuse me , doctor ? Peter , I need to go home . - I don 't like it here . - Walter- - - This city has a smell . - Walter- - It 's wet . It reminds me of St. Claire 's , the mental institution where I lived . Peter , I want to go home . You stay . Help Agent Dunham . Okay . We 'll find someone to take you home . Thank you . Seems pretty harmless . Looks can be deceiving . Buddy , I 've been with the bureau for three years . Flying your father home shouldn 't be a problem . Right . You 'll wanna keep a Sudoku pad handy . There 's a copy of Planck 's book on entropy in his backpack . That should keep him busy . - Under no circumstances let him drink . - Bit of a tippler , huh ? At any given time , there 's a half-dozen psychotropic drugs in his system . So drinking , it 's not a good idea . Thank you , doctor . You know , I really appreciate your cooperation . Yeah , no problem . Do you have a business card ? So that I can send you a copy of the results . Of course . Thank you . No . You can 't put the body in feet-first . Lunatics . Out , out , out ! You think he 'll be all right ? Walter or Agent Kashner ? Greg used to call me every day after lunch . When he didn 't call , I knew something was wrong . But there had ... ? There had been no change in his behavior recently ? He was a little more tired than usual , but he 'd been working a lot . But no illnesses ? No hallucinations ? No , not at all . I can 't believe he 's gone . Mrs. Leiter did your husband have any sleep issues ? A Guide to Sleep Disorders Understanding Sleep ... . He used to sleepwalk . Sometimes he 'd wake up in the kitchen , having cooked a whole meal . - Was he ever violent ? - No . No , never . And he was cured . He had seen a few specialists . He hadn 't had an episode in six months . - We 'll need the names of those doctors . - Did he by chance keep a sleep journal ? Yeah . Would you like to see it ? Yes , please . Just in time , dear . Help me with this infernal body bag . - This is Agent Kashner . - Walter , it 's almost midnight . - Yes , I 'll hold . - The flight back was invigorating . The turbulence over Ohio was like being in the belly of a seizing whale . I screamed like a little girl . I 'm sure that went over well with the rest of the passengers . No , it 's Bishop . B-I-S-H-O-P . Yes , we got the body . - What 's that about ? - They detained our bags . Raw milk ? No , I 'm pretty sure Dr. Bishop wouldn 't have packed a bottle of raw- -milk . Yes , I understand it 's against the law . I 'm a federal agent . That 's odd . Nine stitches . Surgical . There 's no reason for an incision there . Astrix , my small bone saw , please . - Astrid . - Yeah ? Dr. Bishop , I 'm sorry , but those bags won 't be available to us until morning . That 's- - That 's okay . In fact , you can assist us in removing his scalp . Once you get used to the smell , it 's really quite something . Come . - Hey . - Hey . Didn 't wake you , did I ? - What ? - Cute . Except in my case , I actually graduated . I 'm guessing that you bought yours to impress the girls . - Yeah , more or less . - So , what you got ? Greg Leiter 's sleep journal . His wife was right . He 's been averaging between eight and 10 hours of sleep every night . - Then how can he die of exhaustion ? - It gets weirder . He was also using it as a dream diary . Guess what his nightmares were about . - Demons ? - Yeah . At least once a week . Then , couple months ago , all of a sudden , they stop . So do you think this was some kind of extreme sleepwalking ? No , sleepwalkers don 't generally get violent . And unlike Leiter , they don 't remember their experiences . Where did you learn that ? MIT ? When I was a kid , I used to get terrible nightmares almost every night . So I know a thing or two about dreaming . I 'm sorry , that must have been awful . Actually , it was one of the rare occasions in my childhood that Walter was helpful . He taught me to condition myself . Every night before I went to sleep , I had to say a mantra in my head : " Please don 't dream tonight . Please don 't dream tonight . Please don 't dream tonight . " Did that work ? You can 't stop yourself from dreaming , but it did make it so I didn 't remember . From the age of 8 to ... almost 19 , don 't remember a single dream . No more nightmares . There 's been another incident . - You done with the stills ? - Guy on the bike was dead on impact . Must have been driving 40 miles per hour when she hit him . - Crash kill her too ? - She 's dead , but it wasn 't the crash . Ellen was calling to let me know she was heading home from the office . We were on the phone when she ... . She said she saw a monster . Did you see her white hair ? What happened to her ? - Hold it steady , Agent Kasper . - It 's Kashner . - Do this kind of thing often ? - Brains ? No . Although Walter gets particularly excited whenever we do . Hmm . Look at that . Will you call Peter ? Oh . I 'm out . Hey , I 've got Walter for you . A filament ? What kind of filament ? Hold on a second , fellas . Mind if I take a look at her ? There was some kind of little computer chip embedded in his midbrain . The thalamus . Yes , that would make sense . Well done , son . - Hold up , Walter . Agent Dunham . - Excuse me . What does that do ? The thalamus . Why is it relevant ? It 's the part of the brain that regulates sleep . What are you looking for ? Copy that , Central . Can you dispatch ... ? That . Both victims had these surgically implanted . It 's a biochip technically , a brain-computer interface , or BCI . This particular chip has a transmitter which makes it wireless . So it can connect the brain to a remote computer ? That 's right . From what we can ascertain , we think it works a lot like a pacemaker . It monitors sleep cycles and , when necessary stimulates the thalamus , which induces a deeper sleep state . There is a researcher in Seattle who 's worked on several prototypes like it . The man 's a genius . We 've been tracking him for years . Thank you . I 'll let the team know . Dr. Laxmeesh Nayak ? I 'm Olivia Dunham . I 'm with the FBI . We were wondering if you were familiar with Greg Leiter and Ellen Rosiello . Yes , they 're patients . What 's this about ? Both of them recently committed homicidal attacks and then died as a result of what appears to be extreme exhaustion . Oh , God . Dr. Nayak , we found a biochip embedded in Mr. Leiter 's brain . - Do you know what- - ? - Yes , yes , of course . They both had them . They were part of a study . So you 've implanted those into other people ? It 's a large-scale clinical trial . There are 60 in the control group and 82 with the biochips . We 're gonna need their names . All of them . I 've been working on this chip for years . I 've tested it extensively . There 's no malfunction that could 've caused the reaction we saw ? What if the chip shorted out ? Even if it had , the chip should have remained benign . Why is this ... ? Wait here . The main computer server . It contained all my research , the patients ' files . It 's all gone . The patients ' files are backed up on a remote server . I 'll give you the password . - Dr. Nayak . - My research assistant . Zach , call the nurses . We need the names of all the patients , everyone they can remember . Sure . I 'll get right on it . The password . Thank you . Dr. Nayak , can you think of anyone who would wanna steal your data or might wanna sabotage you ? I- - I don 't know . I suppose there are any number of companies . - The chip was valuable . - The initial testing has been remarkable . It 's cured sleepwalking , night terrors , all major non-REM sleep disorders . These people just wanted some rest , and my chip was helping them . It wouldn 't make them hurt anyone , and it certainly wouldn 't kill them . It just doesn 't make any sense . Dr. Nayak , do you have a business card ? Just for our records . Yeah . I 'll get you one . Well , the doctor is beside himself , and aside from the obvious , money can 't think of any reason someone would steal his research . I can . The chip plugs into the thalamus , which not only regulates sleep it also works as a relay tower to the cerebral cortex which also controls motor function . Mind control , Peter . Wouldn 't be the first time someone 's attempted it . I 've told you about my work for the MK-ULTRA project . Course , at the time , we supposed we could do it with LSD and hypnotic suggestion . - So it is possible ? - Theoretically , yes . If I faxed you a schematic of the device 's internal architecture could you test the chip you have ? Yes , though I 'd need to replicate the chip 's function in a neutral environment- - Of course , if I had a live subject- - Walter , no . No student volunteers . Good news . The bags are back . Walter ? Walter ? Walter , say it . No students . All right , no students . Okay , well , get back to me as soon as you can . - Hey . - Hey . So did you reach Walter ? Yeah . He thinks it could be mind control but modifying the chips would take a lot of trial and error . So he thinks someone 's trying to perfect mind control one patient at a time . Well , that would explain why the events are seemingly without motive . - Yeah . How 's the patient roundup going ? - Nayak could only list 26 patients . So the local P.D. are taking them into his clinic and removing their chips , so to speak . That still leaves , what , 50-odd patients ? Listen . I think I understand what you 're going through but that thing you killed that wasn 't Charlie . I know . It 's just , I- - You know , my first week on the job , I was on a sting operation . These Irish thugs were smuggling guns and cocaine and I had been a military prosecutor so I hadn 't handled a gun since basic training and suddenly I 'm underground in this garage wearing a bulletproof vest and wondering how the hell I got there so I did what any rookie would do , and I start looking for an exit . And then Charlie walks over . This man that I didn 't know . This gruff guy . And he said : " You 're gonna be fine . " And I have to face it that he is gone . That he 's not coming back so I 'm just gonna go to Nayak 's clinic and see if I can help the nurse identify some other patients . Okay . That was a double order on Table 9 , Pop . So , what did your friends think of my moussaka ? - Like they 'd died and gone to heaven . - Damn right . Do you really wanna increase the dose ? You want that medium-rare , right ? Yeah . Dr. Bishop , I 'm heading to the airport . Back to Seattle . Could you say goodbye to Agent Farnsworth for me ? Certainly . Oh ! Before you go , could you do me a favor ? Smell this . It seems my olfactory sense is a bit muddled . Must be the French-roast coffee I had for breakfast . Raspberry ? Keep Ms. Barash sedated for another 10 minutes then bring in my next patient . - What 's going on ? - I understand you 're upset . We should contact the local pharmacies . They should be able to identify who 's filled a prescription within the last six months from Dr. Nayak . - Excuse me . Hello ? - What 's shaking , bacon ? The usual . I 'm just painting my toenails and taking a trip up the coast . You get the business cards ? Uh ... . Yeah . I got eight of them . Eight ? You asked everyone you saw wearing red ? Yeah . - So what do I do now ? - Lay them out in front of you . Now take a pen . Circle one letter in every name . Both first and last . When you 're finished , take the letters you 've circled and then write them down on a piece of paper . - Got it ? - Okay . - Now what ? - Now jumble . - Jumble ? - Jumble , anagram , word puzzle . - Find the phrase . - What phrase ? - What am I looking for ? - Whatever it is you need to hear . You 'll figure it out . Gotta go . - I really don 't have any time for this . - Dunham ? - Agent Broyles ? - Nayak 's patient files are gone . The server at the data-storage facility was wiped within the last 24 hours . - Can we trace the hacker 's IP address ? - We don 't think there was one . There 's no sign of a DDoS attack . Given the level of online security whoever wiped the files had a password . - So it was someone in the clinic . - It would seem that way . It 's not possible . My employees are good people . They 've all worked here for years . We 're a family . - They all had the password . - There was no reason for them not to . I 'm telling you , none of them would have done this . Agent Dunham . Another one . Her eyes were going crazy . Her hair turned white , then she collapsed . I don 't understand . She screamed we were cannibals and then attacked with a knife . I had to wrestle it away from her . She was so happy . This doesn 't make sense . Diana suffered from night terrors . She was just in my office last week . We 're going to have to make a public announcement . I 'm gonna get our media liaison to put an announcement in the local news . Zach Miller . My lab assistant . He skipped work today . He hasn 't been answering his phone . Zach Miller ? FBI . Olivia . I guess that 's why he wasn 't answering the phone . Walter , what 's wrong with Agent Kashner ? I drugged him . You drugged him ? Walter , don 't tell me you put that chip in his head . No , but I wanted to . Then I realized that I could attach the chip to an EEG net and the signal would reach his brain . And how were you going to send him commands ? I have wired the neurostimulator to the same frequency . If Peter 's theory is correct and this is mind control the chip should receive commands from me through the neurostimulator . It 's then translated into impulses that Agent Kashner 's brain can understand . Anyway , I need help putting this on . Walter , I do not think this is a very good idea . Don 't be a grinch . I 've told you science should be fun . Come on . Look at his feet . Feet . Got it . Anything ? Nope . Walter , what is it ? Either a green unicorn just raced across the lab or I accidentally took some LSD . Oh ... . Must be mescaline . It 's peaking too quickly . That 's not mescaline . That 's something else entirely . I think that 's not the drugs at all . I think I have an idea what it is . And you 've never gotten anything like this before ? No . Of course not . Okay , I 'm gonna send a copy of this to our questioned-documents unit . They 'll analyze the handwriting , the paper and the ink . In the meantime , the police have offered to put a protective detail outside your clinic . And Detective Green will watch your house . Now , if you 'll excuse us we 've gotta try and track down the rest of your patients . Don 't worry , Dr. Nayak . We 're gonna catch this guy . And you can get back to your work . We 'll call you as soon as we know something . Please leave a message at the tone . I told them . I showed them your damn note . So you might as well stop . So it 's not mind control ? No , Peter . Your theory is wrong . Dr. Nayak 's chips aren 't receiving commands . They 're transmitting massive amounts of data . The biochips are supposed to transmit data . That 's their function , to monitor sleep cycles . The chips aren 't simply monitoring sleep . They 're accessing all sensory information that passes through the thalamus . Every color , sound , and picture while we sleep . Walter , are you saying that Dr. Nayak 's biochips are stealing dreams ? That 's right . Leiter 's sleep journal . He slept for hours , but he never had any dreams . Before they reached his consciousness , they were all siphoned off which means no dreams . The brain can never recharge . And that- - - Would lead to death by exhaustion . - Exactly . What 's more , I believe that the chips have the ability to turn on a dreaming state while the patient is awake which would lead to paranoia , hallucinations and a complete inability to differentiate between reality and dreams . The very behavior we 've been witnessing . Walter , why would anyone wanna access another person 's dreams ? The rush , Peter . Think of your most pleasant dream and multiply that feeling tenfold all mainlining through your cortex in a few of seconds . It 's really quite something . Walter , are you saying that we 're dealing with an addict ? Not just an addict , dear . A man who came in contact with this drug ? In my estimation , that man would become its slave . We gotta go back to the hotel . What are you thinking ? Walter thinks we 're looking for an addict , right ? Well , my stepfather was an addict . He was a drunk . And it was like he had two different personalities . One when he was sober and one when he was smashed . The deeper the addiction , the more extreme the rift . Like Jekyll and Hyde . So this is the patient list that Dr. Nayak wrote out and here is the death threat he received . The handwriting is sloped , but look at the G 's . And the F 's . These were written by the same person . Thank you , Detective Green . You have one message . I told them . I showed them your damn note , so you might as well stop . Please . Double Airways 822 , you are cleared for takeoff . Seattle Tower Cherokee-1461-Tango . Jack , what are you doing ? Jack . Jack . Jack , what are you doing ? Jack , we 've gotta get this bird in the air . November 822 , pilot distressed . Jack . Peter , he 's plugged in . Let me try to shut down the program . November 822 to ATC , I 've got a problem . I 'm gonna have to try to disable the server . - Can you shut it down ? - I think it 's locked . Jack ! November 822 squawking 7700 . Okay , stand back . You 're headed for a collision . Flight 822 , you are headed for a collision . Jack . Flight 822 , 822 . You 're headed for a collision . I repeat- - He 's dead . Hey . Got a call from Radio Control at Lake Union . Incident with a seaplane pilot , one of Nayak 's patients . They 're all safe . Good work . Checked out Nayak 's control panel . All the dials were cranked up into the red . You think he decided to go down in one final blaze of glory ? Actually , I think it was a lot more complicated than that . Remember how horrified Nayak was when we told him his patients were dying ? I don 't think that he was fully aware of what his darker side was up to . This was his way of trying to put a stop to things . I guess that 's the irony . His addiction to dreams became his nightmare . One that he couldn 't wake up from . Maybe that was his only way of ending the nightmare . Dad , what 's wrong ? What is it ? Nothing . You were talking in your sleep . Yeah . I think I was having a bad dream . I was a kid in my room . You were there . And the rest ? You don 't remember it ? Mm-mm .

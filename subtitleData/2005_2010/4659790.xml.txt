 Can 't believe it . They 're right on time . Let 's get these boys to their party . Mama ! Mardi Gras . Now let 's go back in time to 1964 . the heart of New Orleans . Okay . Take it out wide . Give the pig some room . My daughter 's on that ferry . Please . Please . my daughter ! Do the other side ? Agent Donnelly . call New Orleans PD . I want all surveillance from the Algiers dock . Then call City Transit . I want the Crescent City Bridge surveillance westbound between 10 : 00 and 11 : 00 . got it . Hey . Seen an ATF agent around here ? he went down below . How do I get there ? The south side of the bridge . You Agent Minuti ? ATF ? Larry 's my partner . I 'm Doug Carlin . FBI . - How you doing ? - Where 's Minuti ? On vacation . Not anymore . We 're calling in half the region on this one . You can reach him ? CARLIN : I tried . He 's not picking up his phone . try harder . It 's important . Obviously . What are you looking for ? Anything that doesn 't belong . You want to give me a spot ? Yeah . ANFO . ANFO . water-soluble . Fuel oil would have burned off during the blast . if ANFO was used the only place you 'd find it would be ... Underneath this bridge . That 's right . We can 't rule out an accident at this point . - It 's not officially a crime scene yet . - Here 's a thought . Why don 't we double the perimeter so we don 't have wall-to-wall trailers down there ? we 're gonna need all our manpower for evidence control and witness processing . we need to keep it tight until we can determine that it is a crime investigation . It is a crime investigation . Got a piece of electric blasting cap and a strand of what appears to be leg wire . About a million of those blue particles washed up on the Algiers side . It 's probably from a plastic container or a barrel . ANFO ? Most likely . There was post-blast residue under the Crescent City Bridge . The insulation on the leg wire will inform us of who the manufacturer of the blasting cap is . Then we go after the switching mechanism and the bomb 's power source . We probably don 't need to wait for the lab to tell us what we already know that this is an explosive and a trigger . And you are ? ATF . - Who 's in charge ? - We 're working on that now . please . Ed Elkins . I 'm in charge . good . - Yeah . then ? Okay . First things first . Where 's the coffeepot ? Ed ? right ? Operation . We gotta have a coffeepot . you 'll find it in the back . - Back there ? - Yeah . gentlemen . See anything ? Traffic . Hit rewind for me . did Larry call ? Still not answering his cell . We left another message . All right . that girl ever get ahold of you ? - What girl ? dark and handsome . I gave her two out of three . Two out of three . That 's very good . Hit play . Thank you . this is Doug . How you doing ? I know you 're maybe still pissed off at me all right ? - Doug . - Yeah ? Orleans Parish on line one . It 's Sheriff Reed . and they want a profile . tell him they don 't need a profile . got it . CARLIN : Put this on a candy wrapper ? It 's all I had . huh ? Hold it right there . this is ATF Agent Doug Carlin returning your call . My cell number is 504-555-0130 . What 's that ? KEVIN : Looks like a dude on a bike . Run it forward a little bit . Stop right there . What is he doing ? Going to the bathroom ? run it forward . - What time does it say ? - 10 : 47 . isn 't it ? - Right before . please ? Thanks very much for coming . special agent in charge of this investigation . let me say our hearts go out to all of those affected by this tragedy . Early estimates place the number of casualties women and children . this disaster was not an act of nature . and the President concurs with our assessment . as the investigation will take time . It 's a unique and complicated crime scene . There 's no baggage checks . There 's no flight data recorder . and most of the evidence is under 100 feet of muddy water . There are no shortcuts . where 's Doug ? - You just missed him . his car 's still here . - Took the streetcar . don 't look at me . It 's part of his process . He says it helps him think . Sheriff Reed . How you doing ? It 's Doug Carlin returning your call . Doug . I know you got your hands full right now . Bob ? a couple of kids found a woman face down in the waters off Algiers Point . She was burned over 30 % of her body . you 're gonna see a lot of that over the next few weeks . We 've just set up ECC . Just have Crime Scene bag it for us . we already done that . The body 's at the ME 's right now . Crime Scene 's already been there ? they 've been and gone . exactly what time did this woman wash up on shore ? Kid called it in at 10 : 42 a.m. don 't you ? I mean 10 : 42 . I got the sheet right in front of me and I got my reading glasses on . PHIL : Immediately evident is the focal charring of the limbs and torso . neck and chest are intact though swollen from apparent immersion in water . will you ? Right here . There we go . Each digit of the right hand has been severed between the middle and distal phalanges . Thanks . Angle of shearing indicates a single sharp-force trauma possibly caused by shrapnel . it 's too even to be shrapnel trauma . Posterior charring gives off a strong odor suggesting perimortem immersion in burning fuel . Diesel . maybe ? - I don 't know . If she was that close to the bomb she probably wouldn 't be laying here now . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? You got a UV gun ? on the table behind you . - CARLIN : You see that ? - Duct tape . What 's that stippllng ? You see that ? Adhesive probably retained some substance against the water . Yeah . go ahead . I ran down those MPRs for you . A Claire Kuchever was reported missing this morning . pulled a no-show . Okay . I want you to do a full autopsy . Concentrate on time and cause . Full spread of lab tests . Everything . okay ? Absolutely . Claire ? huh ? - Yeah . Very . right ? There 's plenty in the house . Plenty to choose from . I 'm sorry about this but I 'm gonna need you to confirm your daughter 's identity . Okay . anything that you can tell me about your daughter 's activities over the weekend will be helpful . I don 't know . My flight got in at 8 : 00 a.m. this morning but she wasn 't there . I thought maybe she just overslept so I took a cab and I went straight to her house . Her and Alan 's car was gone so I thought maybe she 'd just finally sold it . - Who 's Alan ? - Her fiancé . Or ex-fiancé . They broke up a few months ago . Alan ? - He moved to Montreal . - Okay . anyway . if you want to take it . I would appreciate it . she had a date . she told me that she was gonna meet someone but she didn 't say who . Her friend Beth set it up . Beth . sometimes . Okay . Thank you . That 's good for now . Somebody 'll be in touch . Agent Carlin ? Doug . I want you to take these . that 's ... Just go through them when you get a chance . it is . Agent Carlin and I need her to matter to you . 7 : 48 p.m. Claire . It 's Dad . so don 't stay up too late . Love you . Bye-bye . 9 : 44 a.m. it 's Beth . Are you there ? I started to get worried . hey ! No . that 's all . I can 't talk right now . Someone 's here . I 'll call you later . Claire ... 9 : 50 a.m. 10 : 04 a.m. didn 't I ? waiting for you . I hope you 're sending Beth or someone . Call me . 1 : 18 p.m. this is A TF Agent Doug Carlin returning your call . My cell number is 504-555-0130 . 1 : 18 p.m. this is A TF Agent Doug Carlin returning your call . My cell number is 504-555-0130 . hit the bulkhead and propagated fore and aft along the path of least resistance until it hits this access hatch . And that 's where it gets really bad . S TALHUTH : The blast wave continues bursting the fuel tanks . causing a secondary explosion of far greater magnitude . the initial device turns the whole ferry into a bomb and detonates it . And so our early guess is that the bomb vehicle was a minivan or SUV . - Possibly red or tan . - McCREAD Y : Make and model ? maybe months . - I got a partial on the license plate . Shit . Check all the SUVs and minivans that are registered in the state . Anything recently rented or purchased anything tied to a theft or a missing persons report . - Agent McCready ? - Yeah . ATF . yeah . Oklahoma City . Right . That 's right . I witnessed an autopsy of a young woman who washed up off the Poland Wharf . traces of PETN on her face . that 's the base explosive used by domestic terrorists . She also lost several fingers in what appeared to be blast damage . Appeared ? That 's right . I checked the tide tables against the position of the blast . For her to have washed up that early and that far upriver she would 've had to have been killed two hours before the ferry exploded . Before ? She died before the explosion ? yeah . Her name is Claire Kuchever . She washed up before the explosion and against the tide . I do . taped her mouth dumped her in the river so she would appear to be just another disaster victim . A disaster that hadn 't happened yet . But the PETN tells us that the bomber came in direct contact with the victim . you solve this case . Why this woman ? Good question . Her SUV is missing . It 's a tan and red Bronco . It could have been stolen to drive the bomb to the ferry . one more thing . The victim called the local ATF office the morning of the explosion . Yeah . - We 'll look into it . - Okay . All right . Okay . Where 's Larry ? my partner . That 's his car right there . Is he here ? I thought you said he was on vacation . that 's right . What ? Those cars were brought here from the Algiers ferry parking lot . They 're the vehicles that belonged to the victims . Sorry . So he 's a former Marine ? too . He 's born and bred in New Orleans . His family still in the area ? but his job . - You like him ? - He 's smart . too . All right . Let 's go find him . Oklahoma City . Yeah . - You and Larry were close ? - Yeah . close enough to get on each other 's nerves . I 've been put in charge of a newly-formed investigative unit . and I want you on the team . Why me ? We 've got some unique time constraints . I need someone who can look at a crime scene exactly one time tell us what shouldn 't be there tell us what we can ignore what we need to pursue . you 're local . You know the people and you know the area . But why an ATF guy ? Why not ? It 's your shot . don 't you ? I do . I guess you 've got some questions . first I 'd need to know something . Now I do have some questions . Don 't touch anything . We don 't need you yet . you remember Dr. Alexander Denny . Where 's my audio ? Compensating for audio delay . Just a second . Compensating for a technical blunder by a tech guy ... 45 seconds . GUNNARS : And 14 and a half nanoseconds . DENNY : Okay . be my guest . - Me ? - Yeah . What are we looking for ? anything out of the norm . - When was this taken ? - DENNY : Four and a half days ago . try the guy with the backpack . that 's tender . widen out . see what we got . How can you change the angle on footage taken four and a half days ago ? PRYZWARRA : This is a digital recreation . We 're combining all the data we 've got into one fluid shot . any view within the target area . let 's cruise the breezeway see what we get there . PRYZWARRA : It 's a brand-new program . It 's called Snow White . Our primary data comes from seven orbiting satellites as many as four are surveilling one area . each with their own vantage point . Snow White ? which one of the seven dwarfs can explain to me how you get the audio ? I don 't understand . Why do you gotta look at four days ago ? Why don 't you just fast-forward it to the day of the explosion ? We have to wait . It takes four and a half days to render this single fluid shot . The only thing that matters is that we have exactly one look at any one time . you know ? Can 't look back and see if there was a second gunman . We can 't watch the agent buying 10 pairs of cargo pants in 1983 . All right ? But given enough lead time all right ? It 's the when that 's always constant . It 's always four days and six hours ago . Always . You understand ? in the past . Okay . So if you can 't move forward or backward in time how is it the image keeps speeding up like that ? it 's just our shifting point of view . but we can shift our point of view within the data stream as fast as we want . - You understand ? - Yeah . Yeah . No . I know . three days from now you 'll be able to look back see who did it how they did it and what they did it with . you got it . you need to tell us where to look we could miss it . three days could be too late . could strike again . We need to do whatever we can now . We know he 's out there planning this . We just don 't know where to look . where do we look ? Claire Kuchever 's house . Address is in range . match the viewer settings to the signal . dazzle me . What ? with Snow White we can track through walls . It 's part of the same infrared thermal-imaging stuff they 're using in Iraq . CLAIRE : Hello . This is 877-504-8423 . PRYZWARRA : We triangulate from four satellites pick up the heat signal and reconstruct . we can walk through walls . Claire Kuchever . ALAN : Claire ? Hello ? GUNNARS : Did you know her ? I didn 't know her . wondering how you 're doing . but my boss is an ass . see what she 's looking at ? yeah . though . The city 's phenomenal . You 're gonna love it . Claire ? Claire ? 555-0118 . - Somebody got that ? - Yeah . you there ? and I need you to sell the Bronco as soon as possible . Or at least pay me back my half . I just really need the money . honey . Call me . Unbelievable . - Where 's she ... Can you follow her ? - No problem . I 'm coming . What ? Claire ? Right . What do you got ? We got some bloody cotton swabs and gauze strips in the bathroom Carlin ? when did you completely forget how to investigate a crime scene ? What do you mean ? This place is lousy with your fingerprints . They 're all over the place . okay ? Just humor me . Woman 's bedroom . Vanity mirror . knick-knacks . I get it . Is there anybody there ? Anybody brushing their teeth ? who 's bent over and I have a fine view of the crack of his ass . I get the picture . Talk to you later . You satisfied ? She was supposed to go on a date the night before she died . I want to get her appointment books and everything brought down here anything . I wanna know everything there is to know about this woman . shouldn 't we be concentrating on the ferry ? it 's likely that our guy but we don 't know when . We don 't even know what he looks like . we could stare him right in the face and not know it 's him . in her life . Beth . - BE TH : Claire . That guy I 've been telling you about really wants to meet you . Okay . Tell him I 'll meet him Monday night . Monday . BE TH : How about Sunday if you 're not doing anything ? Monday . - Great . I 'll give him your number . do not give him my number . I 'll go meet him . - He 's not some psycho killer . - Who ? Him who ? I don 't even know if I can do it Monday . Hang on . Show me the book . Monday works . - Damn ! - Shit ! Can we go back ? - No . - Seriously ? it 's far too much data for any existing storage system . no second chances . but we can 't go back and choose to look at something different . though ? - SHANTI : Yes . - Okay . is there any scientific or forensic insight likely to be gained by spying on this woman in the shower ? we 're trying to make sure the woman 's clean . why don 't you look around the rest of the bathroom ? Can you do that ? - Gunnars . - Yeah . - You back ? - Sorry . All right . baby oil . This woman needs a vice . What 's on the other side of that wall ? Kitchen . Let 's take a look . Hello ? Hello ? Maybe there 's someone out there . Maybe there 's a stalker . Someone there ? Ginger . Hello ? Does she know I 'm here ? Does she know we 're here ? impossible . Strictly one-way . You sure ? Hello ? let 's check the perimeter . GUNNARS : Nobody . Who 's watching her ? We are . WO MAN ON TV : They will also take up a request for more money for the ... thank you for blessing me with this food and with my life . I know today 's gonna be a great day . Amen . You guys singing ? You singing a love song ? You singing a love song to one another ? What you doing ? Hi . it 's been a while . Everything God has done will remain forever . There is nothing to add to it nothing to take from it . God has done this so that men should be in awe ... Ex didn 't show . Would you ? MINISTER : Whatever is has already been and what will be has been before . God calls forth the past . Claire loved music . There 's a church near our house and gospel fills the neighborhood . Claire saw a jazz funeral procession . She asked me that day Why do they always wait untll the end to play the good music ? the music 's playing for you now and forever . Were there four limo drivers or five ? right ? right ? He was here . Address is in range . Palace Restaurant . They got good food there . WAITRESS : I 'm so sorry for the wait . I really am . Listen ... Your table will be ready in a few minutes . all right ? It is gonna be a few more minutes for your table ... Go upstairs and see if Table 45 is ready for desserts . - All right ? - MAN : I will . Hold on . Hang on . Hello ? Hello ? are you the lady with the Bronco for sale ? - That 's him . - How do you know ? call up the phone list . Let 's see if it 's a number we 've tracked . that 's me . Just a second . all right ? too . I 'm gonna want a recording of this conversation for voice analysis . there . I 'm what you could call a real motivated buyer . I bet you are . I 'm ready to get something right away . That sounds great . I need to sell something right away . mileage ... So where can I come by and see it ? Don 't tell him . in the French Quarter . - Need directions ? - Now he knows where she lives . I 'll find you . Is tomorrow night good ? I ... Tomorrow night is not good . - Tomorrow ? - I 'm going out tomorrow . He wants to wait for the last possible moment to steal her car then it 's too late to report it . How does Tuesday sound ? Got it . 504-555-0147 . I see it . Tracking . MAN : I think that 's gonna be too late . I need the vehicle Tuesday morning . Is there anyone else there that can show me the car ? - No . Sorry . - He 's thinking . I 'll tell you what . There 's a K5 Blazer ... A date means somebody 's gonna be expecting her and will miss her if she doesn 't show up . I want to see this guy . No good . It 's an outdoor phone booth . Three miles out of range . CLAIRE : I hope to hear from you . Can we get someone out there with a goggle rig ? What 's that do ? Extend the range ? it 's immediate line of sight . But we can use it to gather data outside the target area . Provided there 's any data to gather . How long is this guy gonna be at the phone booth ? Not long . - Have a good night . - Thanks . Bye . Story of my life . too . now we heard the voice of our bomber now we 're gonna go after him the old-fashioned way . Can we get video surveillance on that phone booth ? We can access all surveillance available to any government agency . this is from the ATM camera across the street . All right . Let 's fast-forward to the exact time of his phone call to Claire . Where are we supposed to be looking ? Behind the guy on the left . Gunnars ? GUNNARS : Not enough for an ID . go back . Can you rewind it just a little bit ? Stop . What is that on the ground ? maybe . - We have facial recognition software ? - Yeah . Let 's use it on the bag . Cross-match it to all the bags on the south side of the city all right ? GUNNARS : Don 't think it 's ever been used this way . that 's kind of a simple image to go for a match . we got nowhere else to go . same bag . - Bingo . freeze it . too . Where is this ? Security camera at the Algiers ferry dock . when is this ? Two nights before the explosion . Seven hours from now . Two nights before the explosion is seven hours from now ? we will be able to access this point in our time window . CARLIN : Gotcha . seeing that lady 's life go down in flames . Yep . Makes you appreciate life . I suggest you go home and jump on whoever you got . - That 's what I 'm gonna do . - Nobody home . How 'd you let that happen ? gone . gone . Loved ones gone in a second . doesn 't it ? No matter what right ? we 're gonna grab onto this guy in a couple hours . We 're gonna nail this son of a bitch . What 's wrong ? we still lose her . Right ? WO MAN ON RADIO : ... dot-com for a link to the FEMA Web site . WO MAN ON RADIO : ... dot-com for a link to the FEMA Web site . MAN : Military helicopters that have served as an emergency force are leaving the city . Hundreds of thousands of New Orleans residents and entire neighborhoods ... Did you talk to him ? ... are still waiting to rebuild . This while governmental agencies ... no . CLAIRE : What is it ? but I forgot . - Okay . - Mom is gonna be so mad at me . She 's not gonna be mad at you . Come on . all right ? sweetie . all right ? okay ? - Okay . - All right . - What 's going on ? - Give it a second . - DENNY : Gunnars . - It 's rebooting . It 's coming back . - Are we online ? - Wait . - Are we online ? - Gunnars ! are we back online ? SHANTI : I don 't know . Something broached the field . right there . right there . That 's what broached the field . you wanna tell me what the hell this thing is ? Paul . It 's not electronic thermal imaging . You guys have figured out a way to look into the past . Yes or no ? - No . - You 're lying . and you know it . - I 've told you everything I can . Paul . I pointed this thing at her just now and she responded to it from four and a half days ago . - Explain that to me . - All right . CARLIN : Somebody explain it ! Shanti . Cambridge has been working for National Reconnaissance on an R D grant . Okay . We were attempting to use concentrated bursts of energy to enhance the sensitivity of optical telescopes . we had a breakthrough . we could warp the very fabric of space . not talk science . I 'll tell you what . Why don 't you guys just keep talking ? I 'll just sit here until you figure out what it is you really wanna tell me . They found a way to fold space back onto itself . right ? - Like this piece of paper . - Right . light has always had to travel the long way across the flat space in between . But given what I was trying to explain bring the target closer to us create what 's known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge suspend it via gravitational field . - That 's what we 're looking at ? - That 's it . What 's on the other end of the bridge ? Claire 's house . Wow . we 're folding space in a higher dimension to create an instantaneous link between two distant points . that 's what we hoped for and that 's what we expected . But the electrical force ... We used huge amounts of energy to create this bridge . how huge ? You remember that little blackout we had a few years back ? I do . - New York blamed Canada . - Right . - Canada blamed Michigan . Half the Northeast . You 're saying you guys ... - Fifty million homes . Right . - My bad . but ... so why can 't I see this bridge ? though . It 's just as real and just as solid as a cell phone signal or a radio wave . I don 't know how a cell phone works . I just know how to use it . So how do we use this ? We can look back four and a half days . we can look anywhere ? - Limited radius . right . Looking into the past . we 're always looking in the past . Even light reflected from yourself in the mirror takes some time to reflect back . Let me get this straight . You 're trying to tell me that on the other side of this bridge - is the actual past ? - Yes . look . We created this thing by pure accident . All right ? This space and time ... This time window is a complete fluke . All right ? And everybody is terrified of screwing with it for fear of losing it or suffering the consequences of God knows what which is why it can only be used as a retroactive tool ... let me ask you something . Is she alive or is she dead ? Doug . - I know that but I think the question still applies . Is she alive or is she dead ? is not merely a local phenomenon . All right ! Am I asking a hard question ? Looks like I picked a bad week to stop snorting hash . I tell you what . so those of you with Ph.D. ' s in the room can understand . right ? Now the monitor is broken . It 's dead . It is not temporarily transitioned to another state of entropy . is she alive or is she dead ? - She 's alive . - All right . Now we 're getting somewhere . you said light could go back . What else ? - Nothing . - Something else could be sent back . Paul . Something . What ? A body ? A human being ? anyway . - Why not ? - Because you can 't beat the physics . you transition across all right ? An EM pulse annihllates all electrical activity . that 's everything . So what ? You haven 't tried a person ? Let 's just say that we 've done enough tests to know that it 's not even possible . dead . dead . - What about a radio signal ? What about that ? We could send a radio ... a radio signal . - Won 't work . Electrical . - The field would scramble it . a warning note . - No . - A single piece of paper . One sheet . - No . - If we keep the mass low ... - No ! This could work ! It could work . Sure . We know where the guy 's gonna be . We can apprehend him and put him away before he even blows up the boat . exactly ? - We send it to ourselves ! send it to me . Send it to my office . Send it to my office four and a half days ago and we can capture this guy before he even meets Claire . We know he 's gonna be at the dock . you did it already . it doesn 't matter . You cannot change the past . It 's physically impossible . What if there 's more than physics ? right ? okay . Look . Just try to think of it this way . God 's mind is made up about this . All right ? whatever . it will keep happening - and it always will happen . - Maybe . since we 're calling it something ? Maybe you 're right . Maybe you guys are exactly right . I don 't know . All I know is this . For all of my career I 've been trying to catch people after they do something horrible . For once in my life I 'd like to catch somebody before they do something horrible . All right ? Can you understand that ? Address is in range . Address is in range . two L 's . Since this is such a tremendous waste of taxpayer money the least we could do is get the spelling right . That 's not necessarily true . Branching universe theory holds that you can do ... hold it . All right . no . - I 'll show you . The traditional view of time is linear like a river flowing from the past toward the future . right ? Exactly . Introduce a significant enough event at any point in this river and you create a new branch but along a different route . Changed . but that river is the Mississippi and we 're lobbing what amounts to a pebble into it . don 't you think ? Traditionalist . Say we do create this new branch . What happens to the old one ? To this one ? Ask the radical . it might continue parallel to the new branch but most likely it ceases to exist . we cease to exist . anyway . we never came here . We didn 't meet Doug . We don 't remember it ever happening . that 's worth $ 10 billion right there . Would 've been a lot faster if you 'd written it yourself . Right . Then I recognize my own handwriting and the universe blows up . We 're ready . southwest corner . That 's where we are . MINUTI : How 'd you get that information ? CARLIN : Good police work . That 's me . I can hear me . - I don 't wanna play games with you . - Where am I ? you are . you are . - There I am . - Is that Minuti ? Larry . you know how this job works . I forgot all about this part . happy place to push the note onto . that 's my ... Okay . Line us up . all right ? start pushing . Expand the wave past the note . I can 't watch your back if you 're holding out on me . Why not ? we better hurry up 'cause I think I 'm about to leave . - I need more cowbell . - GUNNARS : I 'm trying . I ... - Good ! Just give me a second . - Don 't talk to each other . - DENNY : Expand . I 'm about to leave . ... another partner ? How about that ? How about that ? - Everybody relax . - Okay . Yeah . - Let 's go . - I 'm working on it . Prepare for the final power surge . Ready ? go ! Walk away . PRYZWARRA : What the hell happened ? DENNY : I don 't know . It doesn 't matter . Doesn 't matter . Pull it back ! - Did it go through ? - I don 't know ! I don 't know ! Pull it back . - There it is . - It went through . - That 's right . - It 's through . PRYZWARRA : It went through ! SHANTI : Great . wait a minute . Hang on . It ain 't great yet . I don 't come back . Larry . I 'm not coming back . Larry . don 't do it . - Follow him . - I 'm on him . let 's ... You know what ? Let 's cut away from Minuti . The bomber 's on his way to the dock . He 's due there any minute . all right ? All right . where is he ? Can we circle it ? We should be able to see him by now . That 's him . There he is . All right . - Holy shit . - CARLIN : All right . Move in on him real close . I want to see his ... That 's him . That 's him . the ATM . That 's our guy . facial ID on him . - Give me some time . - Okay . All right . Take your time . - There 's your partner . - I see him . CARLIN : Try to move in on his truck . See if we can get a plate . - No plate . - Get back on him . Stay on him . Where 's Minuti ? Federal agent ! Turn the engine off ! Turn the engine off ! Tllt back down . GUNNARS : He 's still breathing . - What can we do ? - I don 't know what to do . He 's traveling east . He 's traveling out of range . what can we do ? Anything ? - I don 't know I 'm gonna lose this guy . SHANTI : We 're losing the signal . We have to boost the signal . We need to chase him with the goggle rig . Gunnars is a little busy right now and he 's the only one who can use it . the rig ? It 's ... the rig . Where is it ? - It 's in his Hummer . - Keys in there ? - Yeah . everybody . It 's him . - Carlin . - Where 's he now ? - Is he going east ? - Yes . going up on De Gaulle . and keep feeding me directions . I 'll try and track him with this goggle rig . if he can catch up to the image that could work . how do you turn this thing on ? There 's an on-off button on the back of the rig . I see it . the eyepiece will auto-focus and we 'll see what you see . you 're live . You 're on . hang on . - He 's gone . Out of range . - What ? - Where 's he headed ? - SHAN TI : He 's headed toward the I - 10 . East or west ? GUNNARS : I don 't know . SHANTI : I don 't know . East or west ? We lost the signal . We 're blind in here . hang on . shit ! What ? What happened ? What happened ? This is trippy . look straight ahead . We 've got the window slaved to your goggles . We are seeing what you 're seeing four days in the past . I got him . I got him . He 's back in range . not east on the Crescent City Bridge . There he is . That 's him . Opposite lane . - CARLIN : I got him . - That 's him . That 's him . I got him ! Watch the traffic . - What was that ? - I think he hit something . you 've gotta stay with him . You 're gonna lose him again . what 's happening ? I got him ! I got him . all right . Good . Now stay with him . Send paramedics to the Crescent City Bridge . DENNY : Got that ? I lost him . - I got him ! I got him ! - DENNY : All right . All right . SHANTI : That 's him . He 's headed for the 10 to the bayou . I can see him . He 's right in front of me . Carlin ! What was that ? What the hell was that ? are you all right ? DENNY : Doug ! Doug ? I think it 's broken . I can 't see anything . We still have a signal here . You 're still transmitting . - You can see ? - We 'll talk you through it . Can you still drive ? yeah . Where is he ? Give us a 360 with the goggle rig . DENNY : There ! There he is ! Pan the thing around . - Which way ? - To your right . To your right . There ! There he is ! - He 's taking the road to the bayou ! - Right there ? The road is blocked . Take the expressway . It parallels the road . go ! See him ? Pan right . Pan right ! CARLIN : You still see him ? He 's at the end of the bridge . - DENNY : You hear me ? - He 's at the end of the bridge . Keep talking to me . very close to you right now . He took the exit ramp beneath you . - Take the next off-ramp . - DENNY : Take the next off-ramp ! I 'm on the off-ramp . then double back on yourself . I got it . take another right . Still see him ? He 's heading to the bayou . Take a left here . good . Doug . He 's dead ahead of you . okay . coming to a fence . Do you see it ? I see it . take the backpack . It 's the power source for the rig . It 's the power source for the rig . yeah . we can hear you . We can hear you . All right . What 's he doing now ? He 's pulled around the back of the building . Looks like a bomb went off . Really ? We see an intact structure here . none . Looks like a vehicle 's inside . An ambulance . You see that ? No . Nothing . See anything ? PRYZWARRA : He 's dead ahead of you . he 's pulling Minuti out of the car . Where ? now pan to the right . Pan to the right . - More right . - DENNY : You got him . he 's dragging him out of the car . Do you see him ? - Yeah . - Yes . Right in front of you . Boost the audio for me . Audio boosted . DENN Y : Turn around . Turn around behind you . - Larry ? - Pan back to the right . - You 've got him now . - Where is he ? He 's being dragged on the concrete . Larry ! What 's that sound ? What 's the sound ? He 's pouring some kind of accelerant over Agent Minuti . like at the ferry . He 's waking up . Brace yourselves . I think you 're about to witness a murder . he wouldn 't be dead now . he was already dead from the ferry . We just changed how he died . We don 't know that . He could 've been standing right next to you right until we sent that note . SHAN TI : You 'd need a branching multiple universe for that to happen . come on . We can 't change anything . We didn 't change anything . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . I 'll tell you what we did . The suspect used a stolen Blazer to case the dock . So now he has a truck big enough to drive a bomb onto the ferry . right ? Larry puts bullet holes through the windshield . thanks . Larry puts bullet holes through the windshield you understand ? Claire 's truck . You hungry ? we changed one thing we didn 't change anything . What 's on TV ? we got a name . - Carroll Oerstadt . - WOMAN : What ? - KEVIN : Who is that ? - Owner of that bait camp Doug found . match . And another property . New Orleans . - Is this a he or a she ? - It 's a he . Let 's go . Clear ! four . four . conducting interview with Carroll Oerstadt . conducting interview with Carroll Oerstadt . right ? sir . - Okay . I 'm fascinated with your precision . It 's not very often we see that level of expertise around here I 'd like to use this interview to educate my colleagues in law enforcement . sir . - Good . Good . Let 's talk about motive . Why would you use explosives against the US Navy ? sir . US Government . - US Government . It says here that you tried to enlist in the Marines . You were rejected . You tried to enlist in the Army you were rejected again . Why do you think they did that ? Because they don 't want patriots . The military no longer recognizes commitment and purpose . They thought I was overcommitted and psychologically unstable . They didn 't want to understand my value . They understand it now . sir . I am . I don 't . But I can get you one . - Would you like one ? - Yes . just talk into the mike . tobacco and firearms . I can think of one more thing . you know what I mean ? isn 't it ? CARLIN : Yeah ? OERS TAD T : Exactly . - Yeah . - You get it . - This wasn 't about revenge . - What was it about ? Destiny . Destiny ? You 've been asking me about my motives . - Right . Right . - My methods . They 're all connected . Everything 's connected . Okay . How was Claire Kuchever connected ? I needed a car . something - that couldn 't be traced back to me . - Right . I had one ready till that cop showed up . That cop was a federal agent . Lawrence Minuti . My partner . You shot him . you know ? I 'm not cruel . why didn 't you " do that " for Claire Kuchever ? because I needed her to look like a ferry victim - and a bullet would 've given it away . - I see . - and a bullet would 've given it away . - I see . I went to her house on the pretense of buying her car . taped her mouth and threw a hood over her head . Then ? I bound her wrists and her ankles and I drove her back to my place . I loaded the device into her car and then I soaked her with the gasoline . Jesus . And ? I think you know what happened after that . I don 't know . I want you to tell me . You gotta talk . hero . What happened after that ? I 'll tell you what happened after that . You killed 543 people . How do you feel about that ? I think that you were a murderer right from the beginning . Sometimes a little human collateral is the cost of freedom . those people were war casualties they 're just evidence . That 'll do . We got him . CARLIN : What 'd you say ? You think you know what 's coming ? You don 't have a clue . I know where you 're going . I know you 're gonna be away for a long time . I know that . - This case will never even go to trial . - No ? - ' Cause I seen what 's coming . - Did ... Have you ? What ? huh ? what 's coming ? You tell me . I told you earlier I have a destiny a purpose . but God thinks of eternity . I prostrate myself before a world that 's going to hell in a handbag I am here and I will be remembered . That 's destiny . A bomb has a destiny a predetermined fate set by the hand of its creator . And anyone who tries to alter that destiny will be destroyed . Anyone who tries to stop it from happening will cause it to happen . And that 's what you don 't understand . We 're not here to coexist . I 'm here to win . buddy . You 're gonna need it . You 'd better have some K-Y . You 're gonna need it . What am I supposed to do ? - We 're shutting you down . - What ? we got what we need . a confession . We 're done . perhaps we should continue and watch the actual crime . - The ferry bombing . - Right . He 's right . we can 't just go on the confession alone . We need an airtight case . We need to collect more evidence . Agent Carly . - You took it a little further than that . - Agent Carlin . Carlin . not Carly . We had protocols in place . There 's strict protocols . and now an agent 's dead . that already happened . We 're done . Power it down . Pack it up . On to the next case . - What about Claire ? - What ... charging Oerstadt in the Kuchever murder is gonna raise too many questions about how we obtained the evidence . but what about Claire ? Are we just gonna drop the case ? we got him on killing a federal agent . sir . I don 't give a rat 's ass what you can accept . - She doesn 't matter . - He 's gonna kill her . he 's gonna kill her . - He killed her four days ago . You were at the funeral . What 's wrong with you ? It had to happen . I delayed turning in my report till we caught the guy . mission accomplished . Doug . my job is closure . Your job is to help facilitate that closure . what do I tell her father ? We caught the son of a bitch . We can 't save the victims . It 's not our job to make the relatives feel better . We lose everything that we care about . Those are your words . it 's not your fault that Claire dies . that 's one theory . MAN ON TV : Lieutenant Junior Grade Dianne Kerry . Martin Kyle . retired . Elaine Lacey . Chief Petty Officer Darren McAndrews . Lorraine McAndrews . Electronics Technician Lisa Melville . Chaplain Rabbi Benjamin Mendelsson . Denny ? It 's Doug . I can 't say I wasn 't expecting this call . you know what happens if you try this . We both know what happens if I don 't . not a lot of guinea pigs volunteer to die in the name of science . then we have to make sure I end up somewhere besides the morgue . Can you help me ? I 'll see you when you get here . Doug ? turn off the lights . you set off every alarm in the joint . Can 't take it . Gotta keep the mass as low as possible . You gotta take everything off . - You can keep your underwear on . - Thank you very much . Thought you said you didn 't believe in changing the past . I also believe in God . Just don 't tell anyone . - I 'm gonna tell everybody . - Yeah ? when I open up the throttle on this thing ... flatllne . I got it . no matter how clever we think we are the most probable outcome of our little experiment is that four and a half days ago you get a call from the coroner 's office . I want you to come down here . There 's something you should see . you 're standing over a corpse and it 's you . you can be wrong a million times . You only gotta be right once . right ? So I gotta face out toward you ? only bigger . - You ready ? - No . You don 't have to do this . What if I already have ? Right . Doug ? DENN Y : Doug ? Hey . Hello ? - You okay in there ? - Yeah . I 'm good . I 'm beside myself . Am I still here ? For now . You ready ? I 'm ready . - All right . Looking forward to walking up to you four days ago though . maybe you can tell me what it 's like to meet your younger self . I 'll let you know . okay ? Yeah . Here we go . See you yesterday . God willing . good . - You don 't have to do this . - CLAIRE : Hello ? CARLIN : Maybe I already have . Maybe I already have . everybody . The reserve generators should kick in . Nobody move . That was interesting . - Doctor ! - Who the hell is that ? Where 'd he come from ? Trauma 2 ! DOCTOR : This is weird . - NURSE : Defib . - Clear ! Recharge it again . Clear ! - Recharge to 300 . - Charging . Clear ! eight . MAN ON TV : ... thirty-four degrees . Forty-nine was our low temperature at the airport . Gonna be at that or just maybe above that for tonight . the winds are starting ... - ... a few of them come back . - I 'm thinking about getting a tattoo . - Whoa ! - I 'm a federal agent . I need your keys . I need a vehicle . There 's keys in the truck there . Which one ? Right here ? Put your hands down . Hands on the table . Hold your donut . Hands right there . Water it . MAN ON TV : This might be a metaphor for existence itself . A fish struggles instinctively against an almost formless antagonist . The fish is a largemouth bass . MAN ON RADIO : Here 's the news at 8 : 30 . Federal officials are still baffled by the massive blackout that darkened the entire eastern half of the country early this morning . Hey ! Jesus . it 's okay . Wait a minute ! Listen . Claire ! hang on . it 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . I 'm a federal agent . It 's okay . It 's okay . okay ? I 'm a federal agent . You 're safe . You 're safe . Look at me . Come here . You 're safe . He 's gone . All right ? - Get me out of here ! - All right . All right . Get me out of here ! It 's all right . It 's okay . It 's okay . let me get your feet . It 's all right . It 's all right . It 's all right . look at me . Look at me . okay ? All right . How 'd you know there 'd be keys in this truck ? That 's a good question . I didn 't know . - He 's a terrorist ? - Yeah . His name is Carroll Oerstadt . I 'm a part of a special surveillance unit . We 've been tracking him . He 's planning on blowing up the Canal Street Ferry today at 10 : 50 . it 's too complicated . the ferry will be gone . We gotta go straight to the Algiers dock . I don 't think you 're gonna make it . You 're losing too much blood . I gotta make it . I only got an hour and 40 minutes to catch up to this guy . What if you don 't make it ? What happens then ? If I don 't make it ... What ? Your house is on the way . and I 'll get cleaned up . - I 'll drop you off . All right ? - All right . Ginger . She hates strangers . You need anything ? You get cleaned up . I 'll take care of this . I 'm sure . You go ahead . though . Sure . listen . - You shouldn 't wear that . - What ? Why don 't you put on a different one ? The blue and white one . Anything . It 's just ... Just trust me . The victim wore a dress like that and it wouldn 't be good . - Okay . - Trust me . I 'll go change . I 'll be right out . Stop right there ! Don 't move ! Don 't move . I 'm calling the police . you 're not . you 're not ! You didn 't ask me any questions . You didn 't take a statement . what 's in my closet . - Who are you ? - I 'm Doug Carlin . I 'm an ATF agent . I 'm part of a special surveillance unit that 's been tracking the man - who was trying to kill you . - How do I know that ? I had a hood over my head . You could be him . Claire . Look at my face . You scratched the man 's face . Do I have a scratch on my face ? didn 't you ? - Get on the floor . Now ! Get on the floor ! All the way ! Agent Donnelly . is there an Agent Douglas Carlin working out of that branch ? but he 's not here right now . Would you like to leave a message ? please ? skin color . not bad-looking . have him call me back at 877-504-8423 . wait . My phone pad 's empty . got it . Hello ? Get up . Are you gonna tell me the truth ? why this is happening and none of it makes sense ? None of it . What if you had to tell someone the most important thing in the world but you knew they 'd never believe you ? What would you do ? I 'd try . You never know what someone might believe . I don 't understand what 's ... What 's happening . I gotta hurry up and get down there . Why are you the only one who can stop him ? because I 'm the only one that knows his plan . I 'm the only one that knows where he 's gonna be and exactly what he 's gonna do . How do you know that ? how 'd you know those things about me ? for the sake of argument let 's just say that the government has a special device that allows me to know what 's gonna happen ahead of time . Then how come you didn 't know I was gonna pull a gun on you ? I didn 't . it 's good . One second . it 's great . Okay . - All right . I 'm not very good at this . - You 're very good . What 's the matter ? Jesus . I haven 't changed a thing . I gotta go . And you gotta go with me . Come on . What ? - I thought you said I was safe now . - I was wrong . I was wrong . You gotta go with me now . Right now . wait ! Don 't answer it . Don 't answer it . I 'll prove it to you . That 's your friend Beth calling . Let the machine pick it up . She 's gonna say Claire . It 's Beth . Are you there ? I 'm sorry to call you so early but when you didn 't call me last night I got worried . it 's Beth . Are you there ? I started to get worried . hey ! No . that 's all . I can 't talk right now . Someone 's here . I 'll call you later . Claire ... the only one you 're gonna be safe with is me . - Okay . - Let 's go . I don 't understand . Why not just call the police and have them arrest him at the dock ? He 'll set the bomb off right there on the spot . He can 't know he 's been compromised until it 's too late for him to do anything about it . get on his motorcycle and ride to the Crescent City Bridge to watch . then what ? You defuse the bomb ? Then I defuse the bomb . There 's my truck . - All these people . - There he is . Where ? You see the military jacket coming this way ? It 's just what you said . you see those officers behind you ? - Yeah . - When the ferry pulls off all right ? - They 'll believe me ? - They better believe you . they 'll arrest me . - They won 't arrest you . They 'll take you into custody . You 'll be fine . That 's a good thing . Don 't turn around . Doug ... Be careful . please . Passengers are not allowed on the car deck when the ferry is in motion . Sir ! Sir . you 're gonna have to move to the upper deck . - Passengers aren 't allowed here . - Okay . Can 't believe it . They 're right on time . Let 's get these boys to their party . Mama ! sir ? Sir ! There 's no passengers allowed on the car deck during transit . sir . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Oerstadt . but God thinks of eternity . What did you say ? buddy . I 'm coming out . What 'd you say ? I thought you were a patriot . I am . Patriotism requires sacrifice . - I 'm willing to sacrifice . - Yeah ? Who ? Her ? Me ? but not yourself . The Tree of Liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants . Right . isn 't it ? Oerstadt ? Who are you ? It 's not supposed to be this way . You all right ? you didn 't . I did . Mardi Gras . Now let 's go back in time to 1964 . we 're not . the heart of New Orleans . Hit the gas . Hit the gas ! Put your hands in the air and step out of the vehicle now ! everybody dies . You have until the count of three ! Hit it . One ... But my daughter 's on that ferry . Please . Please . my daughter ! WOMAN : Chrissie ! Chrissie ! Chrissie ! Chrissie ! - It 's my mom ! Mom ! Ma 'am ? We 're gonna need you to stay right here . Someone 's on the way over to take a statement okay ? - Bobby . - Doug . - How you doing ? - All right . Got a live one over here . Pulled her out of the drink . Somehow involved in all of this . Okay . - How you doing ? - Doug ? That 's right . - You okay ? - Yeah . Have we met ? we have . It 's okay . Come on . Come on . - You okay ? - Yeah . - You sure ? - Yeah . Okay . I 'll get you warmed up . What is it ? What is it ? Doug . What if you had to tell someone the most important thing in the world but you knew they 'd never believe you ? I 'd try . No . 074 Can 't believe it . They 're right on time . Let 's get these boys to their party . Mama ! Mardi Gras . Now let 's go back in time to 1964 . the heart of New Orleans . Okay . Take it out wide . Give the pig some room . My daughter 's on that ferry . Please . Please . my daughter ! Do the other side ? Agent Donnelly . call New Orleans PD . I want all surveillance from the Algiers dock . Then call City Transit . I want the Crescent City Bridge surveillance westbound between 10 : 00 and 11 : 00 . got it . Hey . Seen an ATF agent around here ? he went down below . How do I get there ? The south side of the bridge . You Agent Minuti ? ATF ? Larry 's my partner . I 'm Doug Carlin . FBI . - How you doing ? - Where 's Minuti ? On vacation . Not anymore . We 're calling in half the region on this one . You can reach him ? CARLIN : I tried . He 's not picking up his phone . try harder . It 's important . Obviously . What are you looking for ? Anything that doesn 't belong . You want to give me a spot ? Yeah . ANFO . ANFO . water-soluble . Fuel oil would have burned off during the blast . if ANFO was used the only place you 'd find it would be ... Underneath this bridge . That 's right . We can 't rule out an accident at this point . - It 's not officially a crime scene yet . - Here 's a thought . Why don 't we double the perimeter so we don 't have wall-to-wall trailers down there ? we 're gonna need all our manpower for evidence control and witness processing . we need to keep it tight until we can determine that it is a crime investigation . It is a crime investigation . Got a piece of electric blasting cap and a strand of what appears to be leg wire . About a million of those blue particles washed up on the Algiers side . It 's probably from a plastic container or a barrel . ANFO ? Most likely . There was post-blast residue under the Crescent City Bridge . The insulation on the leg wire will inform us of who the manufacturer of the blasting cap is . Then we go after the switching mechanism and the bomb 's power source . We probably don 't need to wait for the lab to tell us what we already know that this is an explosive and a trigger . And you are ? ATF . - Who 's in charge ? - We 're working on that now . please . Ed Elkins . I 'm in charge . good . - Yeah . then ? Okay . First things first . Where 's the coffeepot ? Ed ? right ? Operation . We gotta have a coffeepot . you 'll find it in the back . - Back there ? - Yeah . gentlemen . See anything ? Traffic . Hit rewind for me . did Larry call ? Still not answering his cell . We left another message . All right . that girl ever get ahold of you ? - What girl ? dark and handsome . I gave her two out of three . Two out of three . That 's very good . Hit play . Thank you . this is Doug . How you doing ? I know you 're maybe still pissed off at me all right ? - Doug . - Yeah ? Orleans Parish on line one . It 's Sheriff Reed . and they want a profile tell him they don 't need a profile got it . CARLIN : Put this on a candy wrapper ? It 's all I had . huh ? Hold it right there . this is ATF Agent Doug Carlin returning your call . My cell number is 504-555-0130 . What 's that ? KEVIN : Looks like a dude on a bike . Run it forward a little bit . Stop right there . What is he doing ? Going to the bathroom ? run it forward . - What time does it say ? - 10 : 47 . isn 't it ? - Right before . please ? Thanks very much for coming . special agent in charge of this investigation . let me say our hearts go out to all of those affected by this tragedy . Early estimates place the number of casualties women and children . this disaster was not an act of nature . and the President concurs with our assessment . as the investigation will take time . It 's a unique and complicated crime scene . There 's no baggage checks . There 's no flight data recorder . and most of the evidence is under 100 feet of muddy water . There are no shortcuts . where 's Doug ? - You just missed him . his car 's still here . - Took the streetcar . don 't look at me . It 's part of his process . He says it helps him think . Sheriff Reed . How you doing ? It 's Doug Carlin returning your call . Doug . I know you got your hands full right now . Bob ? a couple of kids found a woman face down in the waters off Algiers Point . She was burned over 30 % of her body . you 're gonna see a lot of that over the next few weeks . We 've just set up ECC . Just have Crime Scene bag it for us . we already done that . The body 's at the ME 's right now . Crime Scene 's already been there ? they 've been and gone . exactly what time did this woman wash up on shore ? Kid called it in at 10 : 42 a.m. don 't you ? I mean 10 : 42 . I got the sheet right in front of me and I got my reading glasses on . PHIL : Immediately evident is the focal charring of the limbs and torso . neck and chest are intact though swollen from apparent immersion in water . will you ? Right here . There we go . Each digit of the right hand has been severed between the middle and distal phalanges . Thanks . Angle of shearing indicates a single sharp-force trauma possibly caused by shrapnel . it 's too even to be shrapnel trauma . Posterior charring gives off a strong odor suggesting perimortem immersion in burning fuel . Diesel . maybe ? - I don 't know . If she was that close to the bomb she probably wouldn 't be laying here now . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? You got a UV gun ? on the table behind you . - CARLIN : You see that ? - Duct tape . What 's that stippling ? You see that ? Adhesive probably retained some substance against the water . Yeah . go ahead . I ran down those MPRs for you . A Claire Kuchever was reported missing this morning . pulled a no-show . Okay . I want you to do a full autopsy . Concentrate on time and cause . Full spread of lab tests . Everything . okay ? Absolutely . Claire ? huh ? - Yeah . Very . right ? There 's plenty in the house . Plenty to choose from . I 'm sorry about this but I 'm gonna need you to confirm your daughter 's identity . Okay . anything that you can tell me about your daughter 's activities over the weekend will be helpful . I don 't know . My flight got in at 8 : 00 a.m. this morning but she wasn 't there . I thought maybe she just overslept so I took a cab and I went straight to her house . Her and Alan 's car was gone so I thought maybe she 'd just finally sold it . - Who 's Alan ? - Her fiancé . Or ex-fiancé . They broke up a few months ago . Alan ? - He moved to Montreal . - Okay . anyway . if you want to take it . I would appreciate it . she had a date . she told me that she was gonna meet someone but she didn 't say who . Her friend Beth set it up . Beth . sometimes . Okay . Thank you . That 's good for now . Somebody 'll be in touch . Agent Carlin ? Doug . I want you to take these . that 's ... Just go through them when you get a chance . it is . Agent Carlin and I need her to matter to you . 7 : 48 p.m. Claire . It 's Dad . so don 't stay up too late . Love you . Bye-bye . 9 : 44 a.m. it 's Beth . Are you there ? I started to get worried . hey ! No . that 's all . I can 't talk right now . Someone 's here . I 'll call you later . Claire ... 9 : 50 a.m. 10 : 04 a.m. didn 't I ? waiting for you . I hope you 're sending Beth or someone . Call me . 1 : 18 p.m. this is A TF Agent Doug Carlin returning your call . My cell number is 504-555-0130 . 1 : 18 p.m. this is A TF Agent Doug Carlin returning your call . My cell number is 504-555-0130 . hit the bulkhead and propagated fore and aft along the path of least resistance until it hits this access hatch . And that 's where it gets really bad . S TALHUTH : The blast wave continues bursting the fuel tanks . causing a secondary explosion of far greater magnitude . the initial device turns the whole ferry into a bomb and detonates it . And so our early guess is that the bomb vehicle was a minivan or SUV . - Possibly red or tan . - McCREADY : Make and model ? maybe months . - I got a partial on the license plate . Shit . Check all the SUVs and minivans that are registered in the state . Anything recently rented or purchased anything tied to a theft or a missing persons report . - Agent McCready ? - Yeah . ATF . yeah . Oklahoma City . Right . That 's right . I witnessed an autopsy of a young woman who washed up off the Poland Wharf . traces of PETN on her face . that 's the base explosive used by domestic terrorists . She also lost several fingers in what appeared to be blast damage . Appeared ? That 's right . I checked the tide tables against the position of the blast . For her to have washed up that early and that far upriver she would 've had to have been killed two hours before the ferry exploded . Before ? She died before the explosion ? yeah . Her name is Claire Kuchever . She washed up before the explosion and against the tide . I do . taped her mouth dumped her in the river so she would appear to be just another disaster victim . A disaster that hadn 't happened yet . But the PETN tells us that the bomber came in direct contact with the victim . you solve this case . Why this woman ? Good question . Her SUV is missing . It 's a tan and red Bronco . It could have been stolen to drive the bomb to the ferry . one more thing . The victim called the local ATF office the morning of the explosion . Yeah . - We 'll look into it . - Okay . All right . Okay . Where 's Larry ? my partner . That 's his car right there . Is he here ? I thought you said he was on vacation . that 's right . What ? Those cars were brought here from the Algiers ferry parking lot . They 're the vehicles that belonged to the victims . Sorry . So he 's a former Marine ? too . He 's born and bred in New Orleans . His family still in the area ? but his job . - You like him ? - He 's smart . too . All right . Let 's go find him . Oklahoma City . Yeah . - You and Larry were close ? - Yeah . close enough to get on each other 's nerves . I 've been put in charge of a newly-formed investigative unit . and I want you on the team . Why me ? We 've got some unique time constraints . I need someone who can look at a crime scene exactly one time tell us what shouldn 't be there tell us what we can ignore what we need to pursue . you 're local . You know the people and you know the area . But why an ATF guy ? Why not ? It 's your shot . don 't you ? I do . I guess you 've got some questions . first I 'd need to know something . Now I do have some questions . Don 't touch anything . We don 't need you yet . you remember Dr. Alexander Denny . Where 's my audio ? Compensating for audio delay . Just a second . Compensating for a technical blunder by a tech guy ... 45 seconds . GUNNARS : And 14 and a half nanoseconds . DENNY : Okay . be my guest . - Me ? - Yeah . What are we looking for ? anything out of the norm . - When was this taken ? - DENNY : Four and a half days ago . try the guy with the backpack . that 's tender . widen out . see what we got . How can you change the angle on footage taken four and a half days ago ? PRYZWARRA : This is a digital recreation . We 're combining all the data we 've got into one fluid shot . any view within the target area . let 's cruise the breezeway see what we get there . PRYZWARRA : It 's a brand-new program . It 's called Snow White . Our primary data comes from seven orbiting satellites as many as four are surveilling one area . each with their own vantage point . Snow White ? which one of the seven dwarfs can explain to me how you get the audio ? I don 't understand . Why do you gotta look at four days ago ? Why don 't you just fast-forward it to the day of the explosion ? We have to wait . It takes four and a half days to render this single fluid shot . The only thing that matters is that we have exactly one look at any one time . you know ? Can 't look back and see if there was a second gunman . We can 't watch the agent buying 10 pairs of cargo pants in 1983 . All right ? But given enough lead time all right ? It 's the when that 's always constant . It 's always four days and six hours ago . Always . You understand ? in the past . Okay . So if you can 't move forward or backward in time how is it the image keeps speeding up like that ? it 's just our shifting point of view . but we can shift our point of view within the data stream as fast as we want . - You understand ? - Yeah . Yeah . No . I know . three days from now you 'll be able to look back see who did it how they did it and what they did it with . you got it . you need to tell us where to look we could miss it . three days could be too late . could strike again . We need to do whatever we can now . We know he 's out there planning this . We just don 't know where to look . where do we look ? Claire Kuchever 's house . Address is in range . match the viewer settings to the signal . dazzle me . What ? with Snow White we can track through walls . It 's part of the same infrared thermal-imaging stuff they 're using in Iraq . CLAIRE : Hello . This is 877-504-8423 . PRYZWARRA : We triangulate from four satellites pick up the heat signal and reconstruct . we can walk through walls . Claire Kuchever . ALAN : Claire ? Hello ? GUNNARS : Did you know her ? I didn 't know her . wondering how you 're doing . but my boss is an ass . see what she 's looking at ? yeah . though . The city 's phenomenal . You 're gonna love it . Claire ? Claire ? 555-0118 . - Somebody got that ? - Yeah . you there ? and I need you to sell the Bronco as soon as possible . Or at least pay me back my half . I just really need the money . honey . Call me . Unbelievable . - Where 's she ... Can you follow her ? - No problem . I 'm coming . What ? Claire ? Right . What do you got ? We got some bloody cotton swabs and gauze strips in the bathroom Carlin ? when did you completely forget how to investigate a crime scene ? What do you mean ? This place is lousy with your fingerprints . They 're all over the place . okay ? Just humor me . Woman 's bedroom . Vanity mirror . knick-knacks . I get it . Is there anybody there ? Anybody brushing their teeth ? who 's bent over and I have a fine view of the crack of his ass . I get the picture . Talk to you later . You satisfied ? She was supposed to go on a date the night before she died . I want to get her appointment books and everything brought down here anything . I wanna know everything there is to know about this woman . shouldn 't we be concentrating on the ferry ? it 's likely that our guy but we don 't know when . We don 't even know what he looks like . we could stare him right in the face and not know it 's him . in her life . Beth . - BE TH : Claire . That guy I 've been telling you about really wants to meet you . Okay . Tell him I 'll meet him Monday night . Monday . BE TH : How about Sunday if you 're not doing anything ? Monday . - Great . I 'll give him your number . do not give him my number . I 'll go meet him . - He 's not some psycho killer . - Who ? Him who ? I don 't even know if I can do it Monday . Hang on . Show me the book . Monday works . - Damn ! - Shit ! Can we go back ? - No . - Seriously ? it 's far too much data for any existing storage system . no second chances . but we can 't go back and choose to look at something different . though ? - SHANTI : Yes . - Okay . is there any scientific or forensic insight likely to be gained by spying on this woman in the shower ? we 're trying to make sure the woman 's clean . why don 't you look around the rest of the bathroom ? Can you do that ? - Gunnars . - Yeah . - You back ? - Sorry . All right . baby oil . This woman needs a vice . What 's on the other side of that wall ? Kitchen . Let 's take a look . Hello ? Hello ? Maybe there 's someone out there . Maybe there 's a stalker . Someone there ? Ginger . Hello ? Does she know I 'm here ? Does she know we 're here ? impossible . Strictly one-way . You sure ? Hello ? let 's check the perimeter . GUNNARS : Nobody . Who 's watching her ? We are . WO MAN ON TV : They will also take up a request for more money for the ... thank you for blessing me with this food and with my life . I know today 's gonna be a great day . Amen . You guys singing ? You singing a love song ? You singing a love song to one another ? What you doing ? Hi . it 's been a while . Everything God has done will remain forever . There is nothing to add to it nothing to take from it . God has done this so that men should be in awe ... Ex didn 't show . Would you ? MINISTER : Whatever is has already been and what will be has been before . God calls forth the past . Claire loved music . There 's a church near our house and gospel fills the neighborhood . Claire saw a jazz funeral procession . She asked me that day Why do they always wait until the end to play the good music ? the music 's playing for you now and forever . Were there four limo drivers or five ? right ? right ? He was here . Address is in range . Palace Restaurant . They got good food there . WAITRESS : I 'm so sorry for the wait . I really am . Listen ... Your table will be ready in a few minutes . all right ? It is gonna be a few more minutes for your table ... Go upstairs and see if Table 45 is ready for desserts . - All right ? - MAN : I will . Hold on . Hang on . Hello ? Hello ? are you the lady with the Bronco for sale ? - That 's him . - How do you know ? call up the phone list . Let 's see if it 's a number we 've tracked . that 's me . Just a second . all right ? too . I 'm gonna want a recording of this conversation for voice analysis . there . I 'm what you could call a real motivated buyer . I bet you are . I 'm ready to get something right away . That sounds great . I need to sell something right away . mileage ... So where can I come by and see it ? Don 't tell him . in the French Quarter . - Need directions ? - Now he knows where she lives . I 'll find you . Is tomorrow night good ? I ... Tomorrow night is not good . - Tomorrow ? - I 'm going out tomorrow . He wants to wait for the last possible moment to steal her car then it 's too late to report it . How does Tuesday sound ? Got it . 504-555-0147 . I see it . Tracking . MAN : I think that 's gonna be too late . I need the vehicle Tuesday morning . Is there anyone else there that can show me the car ? - No . Sorry . - He 's thinking . I 'll tell you what . There 's a K5 Blazer ... A date means somebody 's gonna be expecting her and will miss her if she doesn 't show up . I want to see this guy . No good . It 's an outdoor phone booth . Three miles out of range . CLAIRE : I hope to hear from you . Can we get someone out there with a goggle rig ? What 's that do ? Extend the range ? it 's immediate line of sight . But we can use it to gather data outside the target area . Provided there 's any data to gather . How long is this guy gonna be at the phone booth ? Not long . - Have a good night . - Thanks . Bye . Story of my life . too . now we heard the voice of our bomber now we 're gonna go after him the old-fashioned way . Can we get video surveillance on that phone booth ? We can access all surveillance available to any government agency . this is from the ATM camera across the street . All right . Let 's fast-forward to the exact time of his phone call to Claire . Where are we supposed to be looking ? Behind the guy on the left . Gunnars ? GUNNARS : Not enough for an ID . go back . Can you rewind it just a little bit ? Stop . What is that on the ground ? maybe . - We have facial recognition software ? - Yeah . Let 's use it on the bag . Cross-match it to all the bags on the south side of the city all right ? GUNNARS : Don 't think it 's ever been used this way . that 's kind of a simple image to go for a match . we got nowhere else to go . same bag . - Bingo . freeze it . too . Where is this ? Security camera at the Algiers ferry dock . when is this ? Two nights before the explosion . Seven hours from now . Two nights before the explosion is seven hours from now ? we will be able to access this point in our time window . CARLIN : Gotcha . seeing that lady 's life go down in flames . Yep . Makes you appreciate life . I suggest you go home and jump on whoever you got . - That 's what I 'm gonna do . - Nobody home . How 'd you let that happen ? gone . gone . Loved ones gone in a second . doesn 't it ? No matter what right ? we 're gonna grab onto this guy in a couple hours . We 're gonna nail this son of a bitch . What 's wrong ? we still lose her . Right ? WO MAN ON RADIO : ... dot-com for a link to the FEMA Web site . WO MAN ON RADIO : ... dot-com for a link to the FEMA Web site . MAN : Military helicopters that have served as an emergency force are leaving the city . Hundreds of thousands of New Orleans residents and entire neighborhoods ... Did you talk to him ? ... are still waiting to rebuild . This while governmental agencies ... no . CLAIRE : What is it ? but I forgot . - Okay . - Mom is gonna be so mad at me . She 's not gonna be mad at you . Come on . all right ? sweetie . all right ? okay ? - Okay . - All right . - What 's going on ? - Give it a second . - DENNY : Gunnars . - It 's rebooting . It 's coming back . - Are we online ? - Wait . - Are we online ? - Gunnars ! are we back online ? SHANTI : I don 't know . Something broached the field . right there . right there . That 's what broached the field . you wanna tell me what the hell this thing is ? Paul . It 's not electronic thermal imaging . You guys have figured out a way to look into the past . Yes or no ? - No . - You 're lying . and you know it . - I 've told you everything I can . Paul . I pointed this thing at her just now and she responded to it from four and a half days ago . - Explain that to me . - All right . CARLIN : Somebody explain it ! Shanti . Cambridge has been working for National Reconnaissance on an R D grant . Okay . We were attempting to use concentrated bursts of energy to enhance the sensitivity of optical telescopes . we had a breakthrough . we could warp the very fabric of space . not talk science . I 'll tell you what . Why don 't you guys just keep talking ? I 'll just sit here until you figure out what it is you really wanna tell me . They found a way to fold space back onto itself . right ? - Like this piece of paper . - Right . light has always had to travel the long way across the flat space in between . But given what I was trying to explain bring the target closer to us create what 's known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge suspend it via gravitational field . - That 's what we 're looking at ? - That 's it . What 's on the other end of the bridge ? Claire 's house . Wow . we 're folding space in a higher dimension to create an instantaneous link between two distant points . that 's what we hoped for and that 's what we expected . But the electrical force ... We used huge amounts of energy to create this bridge . how huge ? You remember that little blackout we had a few years back ? I do . - New York blamed Canada . - Right . - Canada blamed Michigan . Half the Northeast . You 're saying you guys ... - Fifty million homes . Right . - My bad . but ... so why can 't I see this bridge ? though . It 's just as real and just as solid as a cell phone signal or a radio wave . I don 't know how a cell phone works . I just know how to use it . So how do we use this ? We can look back four and a half days . we can look anywhere ? - Limited radius . right . Looking into the past . we 're always looking in the past . Even light reflected from yourself in the mirror takes some time to reflect back . Let me get this straight . You 're trying to tell me that on the other side of this bridge - is the actual past ? - Yes . look . We created this thing by pure accident . All right ? This space and time ... This time window is a complete fluke . All right ? And everybody is terrified of screwing with it for fear of losing it or suffering the consequences of God knows what which is why it can only be used as a retroactive tool ... let me ask you something . Is she alive or is she dead ? Doug . - I know that but I think the question still applies Is she alive or is she dead ? is not merely a local phenomenon . All right ! Am I asking a hard question ? Looks like I picked a bad week to stop snorting hash . I tell you what . so those of you with Ph.D 's in the room can understand . right ? Now the monitor is broken . It 's dead . It is not temporally transitioned to another state of entropy . is she alive or is she dead ? - She 's alive - All right . Now we 're getting somewhere . you said light could go back . What else ? - Nothing . - Something else could be sent back . Paul . Something . What ? A body ? A human being ? anyway . - Why not ? - Because you can 't beat the physics . you transition across all right ? An EM pulse annihilates all electrical activity . that 's everything . So what ? You haven 't tried a person ? Let 's just say that we 've done enough tests to know that it 's not even possible . dead . dead . - What about a radio signal ? What about that ? We could send a radio ... a radio signal . - Won 't work . Electrical . - The field would scramble it . a warning note . - No . - A single piece of paper . One sheet . - No . - If we keep the mass low ... - No ! This could work ! It could work . Sure . We know where the guy 's gonna be . We can apprehend him and put him away before he even blows up the boat . exactly ? - We send it to ourselves ! send it to me . Send it to my office . Send it to my office four and a half days ago and we can capture this guy before he even meets Claire . We know he 's gonna be at the dock . you did it already . it doesn 't matter . You cannot change the past . It 's physically impossible . What if there 's more than physics ? right ? okay . Look . Just try to think of it this way . God 's mind is made up about this . All right ? whatever . it will keep happening - and it always will happen . - Maybe . since we 're calling it something ? Maybe you 're right . Maybe you guys are exactly right . I don 't know . All I know is this . For all of my career I 've been trying to catch people after they do something horrible . For once in my life I 'd like to catch somebody before they do something horrible . All right ? Can you understand that ? Address is in range . Address is in range . two L 's . Since this is such a tremendous waste of taxpayer money the least we could do is get the spelling right . That 's not necessarily true . Branching universe theory holds that you can do ... hold it . All right . no . - I 'll show you . The traditional view of time is linear like a river flowing from the past toward the future . right ? Exactly . Introduce a significant enough event at any point in this river and you create a new branch but along a different route . Changed . but that river is the Mississippi and we 're lobbing what amounts to a pebble into it . don 't you think ? Traditionalist . Say we do create this new branch . What happens to the old one ? To this one ? Ask the radical . it might continue parallel to the new branch but most likely it ceases to exist . we cease to exist . anyway . we never came here . We didn 't meet Doug . We don 't remember it ever happening . that 's worth $ 10 billion right there . Would 've been a lot faster if you 'd written it yourself . Right . Then I recognize my own handwriting and the universe blows up . We 're ready . southwest corner . That 's where we are . MINUTI : How 'd you get that information ? CARLIN : Good police work . That 's me . I can hear me . - I don 't wanna play games with you . - Where am I ? you are . you are . - There I am . - Is that Minuti ? Larry . you know how this job works . I forgot all about this part . happy place to push the note onto . that 's my ... Okay . Line us up . all right ? start pushing . Expand the wave past the note . I can 't watch your back if you 're holding out on me . Why not ? we better hurry up 'cause I think I 'm about to leave . - I need more cowbell . - GUNNARS : I 'm trying . I ... - Good ! Just give me a second . - Don 't talk to each other . - DENNY : Expand . I 'm about to leave . ... another partner ? How about that ? How about that ? - Everybody relax . - Okay . Yeah . - Let 's go . - I 'm working on it . Prepare for the final power surge . Ready ? go ! Walk away . PRYZWARRA : What the hell happened ? DENNY : I don 't know . It doesn 't matter . Doesn 't matter . Pull it back ! - Did it go through ? - I don 't know ! I don 't know ! Pull it back . - There it is . - It went through . - That 's right . - It 's through . PRYZWARRA : It went through ! SHANTI : Great . wait a minute . Hang on . It ain 't great yet . I don 't come back . Larry . I 'm not coming back . Larry . don 't do it . - Follow him . - I 'm on him . let 's ... You know what ? Let 's cut away from Minuti . The bomber 's on his way to the dock . He 's due there any minute . all right ? All right . where is he ? Can we circle it ? We should be able to see him by now . That 's him . There he is . All right . - Holy shit . - CARLIN : All right . Move in on him real close . I want to see his ... That 's him . That 's him . the ATM . That 's our guy . facial ID on him . - Give me some time . - Okay . All right . Take your time . - There 's your partner . - I see him . CARLIN : Try to move in on his truck . See if we can get a plate . - No plate . - Get back on him . Stay on him . Where 's Minuti ? Federal agent ! Turn the engine off ! Turn the engine off ! Tilt back down . GUNNARS : He 's still breathing . - What can we do ? - I don 't know what to do . He 's traveling east . He 's traveling out of range . what can we do ? Anything ? - I don 't know I 'm gonna lose this guy . SHANTI : We 're losing the signal . We have to boost the signal . We need to chase him with the goggle rig . Gunnars is a little busy right now and he 's the only one who can use it . the rig ? It 's ... the rig . Where is it ? - It 's in his Hummer . - Keys in there ? - Yeah . everybody . It 's him . - Carlin . - Where 's he now ? - Is he going east ? - Yes . going up on De Gaulle . and keep feeding me directions . I 'll try and track him with this goggle rig . if he can catch up to the image that could work . how do you turn this thing on ? There 's an on-off button on the back of the rig . I see it . the eyepiece will auto-focus and we 'll see what you see . you 're live . You 're on . hang on . - He 's gone . Out of range . - What ? - Where 's he headed ? - SHAN TI : He 's headed toward the I - 10 . East or west ? GUNNARS : I don 't know . SHANTI : I don 't know . East or west ? We lost the signal . We 're blind in here . hang on . shit ! What ? What happened ? What happened ? This is trippy . look straight ahead . We 've got the window slaved to your goggles . We are seeing what you 're seeing four days in the past . I got him . I got him . He 's back in range . not east on the Crescent City Bridge . There he is . That 's him . Opposite lane . - CARLIN : I got him . - That 's him . That 's him . I got him ! Watch the traffic . - What was that ? - I think he hit something . you 've gotta stay with him . You 're gonna lose him again . what 's happening ? I got him ! I got him . all right . Good . Now stay with him . Send paramedics to the Crescent City Bridge . DENNY : Got that ? I lost him . - I got him ! I got him ! - DENNY : All right . All right . SHANTI : That 's him . He 's headed for the 10 to the bayou . I can see him . He 's right in front of me . Carlin ! What was that ? What the hell was that ? are you all right ? DENNY : Doug ! Doug ? I think it 's broken . I can 't see anything . We still have a signal here . You 're still transmitting . - You can see ? - We 'll talk you through it . Can you still drive ? yeah . Where is he ? Give us a 360 with the goggle rig . DENNY : There ! There he is ! Pan the thing around . - Which way ? - To your right . To your right . There ! There he is ! - He 's taking the road to the bayou ! - Right there ? The road is blocked . Take the expressway . It parallels the road . go ! See him ? Pan right . Pan right ! CARLIN : You still see him ? He 's at the end of the bridge . - DENNY : You hear me ? - He 's at the end of the bridge . Keep talking to me . very close to you right now . He took the exit ramp beneath you . - Take the next off-ramp . - DENNY : Take the next off-ramp ! I 'm on the off-ramp . then double back on yourself . I got it . take another right . Still see him ? He 's heading to the bayou . Take a left here . good . Doug . He 's dead ahead of you . okay . coming to a fence . Do you see it ? I see it . take the backpack . It 's the power source for the rig . It 's the power source for the rig . yeah . we can hear you . We can hear you . All right . What 's he doing now ? He 's pulled around the back of the building Looks like a bomb went off . Really ? We see an intact structure here . none . Looks like a vehicle 's inside . An ambulance . You see that ? No . Nothing . See anything ? PRYZWARRA : He 's dead ahead of you . he 's pulling Minuti out of the car . Where ? now pan to the right . Pan to the right . - More right . - DENNY : You got him . he 's dragging him out of the car . Do you see him ? - Yeah . - Yes . Right in front of you . Boost the audio for me . Audio boosted . DENN Y : Turn around . Turn around behind you . - Larry ? - Pan back to the right . - You 've got him now . - Where is he ? He 's being dragged on the concrete . Larry ! What 's that sound ? What 's the sound ? He 's pouring some kind of accelerant over Agent Minuti . like at the ferry . He 's waking up . Brace yourselves . I think you 're about to witness a murder . he wouldn 't be dead now . he was already dead from the ferry . We just changed how he died . We don 't know that . He could 've been standing right next to you right until we sent that note . SHAN TI : You 'd need a branching multiple universe for that to happen . come on . We can 't change anything . We didn 't change anything . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . I 'll tell you what we did . The suspect used a stolen Blazer to case the dock . So now he has a truck big enough to drive a bomb onto the ferry . right ? Larry puts bullet holes through the windshield . thanks . Larry puts bullet holes through the windshield you understand ? Claire 's truck . You hungry ? we changed one thing we didn 't change anything . What 's on TV ? we got a name . - Carroll Oerstadt . - WOMAN : What ? - KEVIN : Who is that ? - Owner of that bait camp Doug found . match . And another property . New Orleans . - Is this a he or a she ? - It 's a he . Let 's go . Clear ! four . four . conducting interview with Carroll Oerstadt . conducting interview with Carroll Oerstadt . right ? sir . - Okay . I 'm fascinated with your precision . It 's not very often we see that level of expertise around here I 'd like to use this interview to educate my colleagues in law enforcement . sir . - Good . Good . Let 's talk about motive . Why would you use explosives against the US Navy ? sir . US Government . - US Government . It says here that you tried to enlist in the Marines . You were rejected . You tried to enlist in the Army you were rejected again . Why do you think they did that ? Because they don 't want patriots . The military no longer recognizes commitment and purpose . They thought I was over committed and psychologically unstable . They didn 't want to understand my value . They understand it now . sir . I am . I don 't . But I can get you one . - Would you like one ? - Yes . just talk into the mike . tobacco and firearms . I can think of one more thing . you know what I mean ? isn 't it ? CARLIN : Yeah ? OERS TAD T : Exactly . - Yeah . - You get it . - This wasn 't about revenge . - What was it about ? Destiny . Destiny ? You 've been asking me about my motives . - Right . Right . - My methods . They 're all connected . Everything 's connected . Okay . How was Claire Kuchever connected ? I needed a car . something - that couldn 't be traced back to me . - Right . I had one ready till that cop showed up . That cop was a federal agent . Lawrence Minuti . My partner . You shot him . you know ? I 'm not cruel . why didn 't you " do that " for Claire Kuchever ? because I needed her to look like a ferry victim - and a bullet would 've given it away . - I see . - and a bullet would 've given it away . - I see . I went to her house on the pretense of buying her car . taped her mouth and threw a hood over her head . Then ? I bound her wrists and her ankles and I drove her back to my place . I loaded the device into her car and then I soaked her with the gasoline . Jesus . And ? I think you know what happened after that . I don 't know . I want you to tell me . You gotta talk . hero . What happened after that ? I 'll tell you what happened after that . You killed 543 people . How do you feel about that ? I think that you were a murderer right from the beginning . Sometimes a little human collateral is the cost of freedom . those people were war casualties they 're just evidence . That 'll do . We got him . CARLIN : What 'd you say ? You think you know what 's coming ? You don 't have a clue . I know where you 're going . I know you 're gonna be away for a long time . I know that . - This case will never even go to trial . - No ? - ' Cause I seen what 's coming . - Did ... Have you ? What ? huh ? what 's coming ? You tell me . I told you earlier I have a destiny a purpose . but God thinks of eternity . I prostrate myself before a world that 's going to hell in a handbag I am here and I will be remembered . That 's destiny . A bomb has a destiny a predetermined fate set by the hand of its creator . And anyone who tries to alter that destiny will be destroyed . Anyone who tries to stop it from happening will cause it to happen . And that 's what you don 't understand . We 're not here to coexist . I 'm here to win . buddy . You 're gonna need it . You 'd better have some K-Y . You 're gonna need it . What am I supposed to do ? - We 're shutting you down . - What ? we got what we need . a confession . We 're done . perhaps we should continue and watch the actual crime . - The ferry bombing . - Right . He 's right . we can 't just go on the confession alone . We need an airtight case . We need to collect more evidence . Agent Carly . - You took it a little further than that . - Agent Carlin . Carlin . not Carly . We had protocols in place . There 's strict protocols . and now an agent 's dead . that already happened . We 're done . Power it down . Pack it up . On to the next case . - What about Claire ? - What ... charging Oerstadt in the Kuchever murder is gonna raise too many questions about how we obtained the evidence . but what about Claire ? Are we just gonna drop the case ? we got him on killing a federal agent . sir . I don 't give a rat 's ass what you can accept . - She doesn 't matter . - He 's gonna kill her . he 's gonna kill her . - He killed her four days ago . You were at the funeral . What 's wrong with you ? It had to happen . I delayed turning in my report till we caught the guy . mission accomplished Doug . my job is closure . Your job is to help facilitate that closure . what do I tell her father ? We caught the son of a bitch . We can 't save the victims . It 's not our job to make the relatives feel better . We lose everything that we care about . Those are your words . it 's not your fault that Claire dies . that 's one theory . MAN ON TV : Lieutenant Junior Grade Dianne Kerry . Martin Kyle . retired . Elaine Lacey . Chief Petty Officer Darren McAndrews . Lorraine McAndrews . Electronics Technician Lisa Melville . Chaplain Rabbi Benjamin Mendelsson . Denny ? It 's Doug . I can 't say I wasn 't expecting this call . you know what happens if you try this . We both know what happens if I don 't . not a lot of guinea pigs volunteer to die in the name of science . then we have to make sure I end up somewhere besides the morgue . Can you help me ? I 'll see you when you get here . Doug ? turn off the lights . you set off every alarm in the joint . Can 't take it . Gotta keep the mass as low as possible . You gotta take everything off . - You can keep your underwear on . - Thank you very much . Thought you said you didn 't believe in changing the past . I also believe in God . Just don 't tell anyone . - I 'm gonna tell everybody . - Yeah ? when I open up the throttle on this thing ... flat line . I got it . no matter how clever we think we are the most probable outcome of our little experiment is that four and a half days ago you get a call from the coroner 's office . I want you to come down here . There 's something you should see . you 're standing over a corpse and it 's you . you can be wrong a million times . You only gotta be right once . right ? So I gotta face out toward you ? only bigger . - You ready ? - No . You don 't have to do this . What if I already have ? Right . Doug ? DENN Y : Doug ? Hey . Hello ? - You okay in there ? - Yeah . I 'm good . I 'm beside myself . Am I still here ? For now . You ready ? I 'm ready . - All right . Looking forward to walking up to you four days ago though . maybe you can tell me what it 's like to meet your younger self . I 'll let you know . okay ? Yeah . Here we go . See you yesterday . God willing . good . - You don 't have to do this . - CLAIRE : Hello ? CARLIN : Maybe I already have . Maybe I already have . everybody . The reserve generators should kick in . Nobody move . That was interesting . - Doctor ! - Who the hell is that ? Where 'd he come from ? Trauma 2 ! DOCTOR : This is weird . - NURSE : Defib . - Clear ! Recharge it again . Clear ! - Recharge to 300 . - Charging . Clear ! eight . MAN ON TV : ... thirty-four degrees . Forty-nine was our low temperature at the airport . Gonna be at that or just maybe above that for tonight . the winds are starting ... - ... a few of them come back . - I 'm thinking about getting a tattoo . - Whoa ! - I 'm a federal agent . I need your keys . I need a vehicle . There 's keys in the truck there . Which one ? Right here ? Put your hands down . Hands on the table . Hold your donut . Hands right there . Water it .

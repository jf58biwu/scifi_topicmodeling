 This might enable us to repair brains that have been damaged ... through accidents or disease . But it will also make it perhaps possible to establish ... communication directly , from one brain to another . Something that today is essentially limited to speech between humans . Thus , instead of using speech ... it might become possible to communicate directly , brain-to-brain . It 's quite a fantastic notion to imagine . Though I must also say that there are many other applications ... perhaps more practical in use , in the short-term . By pinpointing the electric circuitry ... at different sections of the brain ... we should be able to read the contents of that brain ... put it on a hard disk and then transmit this directly to another person 's brain , etc .

 Mayday ! Mayday ! We have broken orbit ! Repeat : Gargantua-1 has broken orbit ! We 've lost stabilizers ! Retrorockets are offline ... and all failsafes have ... failed ! Houston , do you copy ? ! We 're done for , Anna . Make peace with your higher power . There is one thing we could try . Anna ! What are you doing ? ! Restrain yourself ! Look at that ! Clamoring for a piece of that big phony . - That should be me up there . - Really ? - Why is that exactly ? - ls that supposed to be a joke ? Whose space station just saved the world ? Manstrong 's ? No , mine . He was just along for the ride . They might as well give a medal to the seats ... while they 're pinning one on Luck Rogers . Luck Rogers ? Do you like that ? I almost said Flash-ln-the-Pan Gordon . - Glad you didn 't . - No pictures , son . Aw , gyp ! Yeah ! Join the bush club . - Samson . - Houser . What 's the matter ? Couldn 't hack field work anymore ... so they made you White House hall monitor ? You listen to me , and you listen to me great , Samson . You may be a osi , but here , at the White House ... you 're just another civilian . And I got my eyes on you . Both of you . - Friend of yours ? - We were in ' Nam together . Wait ! You were , like , ten during Vietnam . I didn 't say during the war . There I was ... grappling with the controls ... of the proud and mighty grande dame of the stars ... as she burned up on re-entry . Let him have his moment . I 'll have my turn , as soon as the President ... gets a load of a certain little something something ... I just happened to bring along . Tell me you didn 't bring that thing with you . Do you hate these things as much as I do ? Bunch of back-patting phonies ! At least the wine is decent . Keep it coming , honey ! And the next thing I knew ... I was waking up in an army hospital in lranistan . Really ? And that 's all you remember about the whole darned thing ? Unfortunately , yes . I suppose it was that nasty bump on the head I took in the crash . Manstrong ? Colonel Bud Manstrong , can you hear me ? He 's coming out of it . The procedure was a success . - What about the chip ? - lt 's not going anywhere . - Who 's your friend over here ? - That 's Brock Samson . - But he is no friend of mine . - Too bad . Remember when I called to tell you I 'd been accosted on Gargantua-1 ? Of course I do ! Oh , the tears ! The sniffling ! Yes , well ... - He 's the fellow who did it . - Him ? ! So , why 'd you beat my little boy up and steal his girlfriend , blondie ? - Oh , mother . - Don 't say too much , do you ? Well , that 's OK . I like the strong and silent type . Ladies and gentlemen , a toast to Colonel Bud Manstrong . A man of bravery , integrity , and indomitable spirit ... Oh , quit blowing smoke up the boy 's ass , Breyer . We all know the real reason Bud 's here . Your administration 's in the crapper , and you need ... Mrs. Manstrong 's little boyscout on the team to polish that turd . To Bud ! Mother ! You can 't talk to the President like that . Well , I didn 't vote for him ! Listen , you just keep smiling , and let your mother deal with the politics . He 's embarrassed by his mother . I breast-fed this one till he lost his baby teeth ... and he 's embarrassed by me ? Oh , mother ! Prudish ! Takes after his father , the late Senator , God rest his soul . Man couldn 't find a G-spot without a Senate Subcommittee . - Oh , mother ! - Say , Bud ! Or is it Budly ? Budward ? What 's Bud short for ? Nothing. lt 's just Bud . Yeah ? Seeing as how you 're all tight with the big guy ... because you broke my space station ... I was wondering , if maybe , you might put in a good word for me . Why don 't you stop bothering my son , you awful little nobody ! Vultures , Buddy ! Everyone 's gonna want a piece of you now ... but you don 't give ' em a thing . - Are you listening to me ? ! - Yes , mother . Colonel Bud Manstrong ... listen to your mother ! Yes , mother . So , then the teacher said , " Johnny Deeper ! " ... and so he stuck it in deeper ! What ? ! Seriously , lady ! Knock it off ! I 'm not into it ! Smooth . Well , perhaps we should call it a night , eh , folks ? Thank y 'all for coming , and please , let 's ... let 's have another round of applause for the good Colonel . Come on . Hands together . You , too . Why don 't you come see me privately in the Oval Office ? You boys better come with me . But ... Johnny Deeper ! I 'm terribly sorry , sir . Mother is ... headstrong . She speaks her mind ... and one has no choice but to listen . Now don 't you sweat it , Colonel Hangdog . Your mother 's right . My administration 's up to its ass in scandal . Hell , my VP is under indictment . Anyways , I 'm up for re-election in November . And I don 't have a Chinaman 's chance ... unless I find me a squeaky-clean running mate . Good luck in this town , though . Cigar ? Well , I don 't usually partake , but ... Shucks ! I 'm not in an oxygen-rich environment anymore ! And how can one decline an offer ... from the President of these United States ? Wait . Not that one . I 'm glad you feel that way , Bud ... 'cause I 've got a proposition for you . How 'd you like to be Vice President ? Me ? ! Hell , yeah , you ! Who 'd you think I 'm talking about ? You 're a genuine hero , boy . The Bureau can 't find a damn thing on you ... and , plus , you 're a little bit of the eye candy for the ladies . Speaking of which ... - Take your pick . - l 'm not sure I follow you , sir . Any of my secretarial staff . Except the one in the blue dress that smells like this . Dear Lord ! That Phyllis ' got my name written all over her ! Literally ! I once wrote my name on the front of her dress with the tip of my ... Oh , no ! I 'm not hearing this ! I 'm not hearing this ! Good evening , sir ! Cass ? I 'll take that blowjob now . Now , you boys get yourselves some sleep ... and don 't you worry about a thing . I 'm just gonna get some club soda on these here stains before they set . All your troubles be over . I don 't think club soda can fix my problem . Child . Little club soda get out most anything . - Wait ! Don 't leave ! - Dude , what is your damage ? I saw something . I think this place is ... haunted . You 're just being superstitious . I am not ! Just extra-stitious . There 's something wiggy going on . I can feel it . It 's like ... like we 're being watched . Yeah , well ... Lincoln bedroom is secure . Over . Slow down , Buddy . - Tell mama what happened . - He was horrible , mother ! That drooling , foul-mouthed , pervert of a man ... And crude ! He said the most disgraceful , ribaldrous things . Yeah , yeah . Did he offer you Vice President ? He did ! And I told him ... he could just take that job and he could ... he could stick ... he could take it ... and he could stick the job in ... I ran away ! Then get back in there and tell him you changed your mind . You want me to come with you and show you how ? Like when mama held your pee-pee ... and taught you how to make your sisses ? But , mother , you said not to give anyone anything . Without getting something in return , Buddy . You gotta make him pay , Buddy ! But I don 't want ... Colonel Bud Manstrong , listen to your mother . You will go back in there and take this job ... because it will put you next to the most powerful man in the world . Now , be a man and do what has to be done ! Oh , come on , Brock . Just buy me five minutes . I 've been practicing my pitch all week . You just have no clue , do you ? These aren 't a bunch of fake pirates or dinks in rubber butterfly suits , Doc . We 're talking about the United States Secret Service . Please . We 'll both be off the hook when he feasts his eyes on what I have to offer . This thing sells itself. lf it doesn 't , I can 't afford to pay you this month . - You don 't pay me . - Why do you keep looking around ? You 're really afraid of that Houser guy , aren 't you ? No . Manstrong 's mom . She 's got a few drinks in her ... and she tried to free Nelson Mandela under the table . Say ... OK , plan B. You throw the old broad a mercy lay ... and in exchange she sweet-talks the President for me . Nice scene you made at dinner , Samson . Don 't ever embarrass the President like that again . I don 't think the agency could possibly demote you ... any lower than they already have . But I hear there 's an opening in the mail room . Helsinki branch . I gotta take ... I got a call. I gotta take this . You know what , Doc ? - You 're on . - Really ? Plan A or plan B ? Venture brothers ! You must help me ! Colonel Manstrong is going to assassinate the President ! Hank , wake up ! It 's the ghost of Abraham Lincoln ! Who ? Mr. President ... my boy had a little crisis of conscience earlier . But ... well ... Just do it , Buddy . Mr. President ... Oh , my God ! Hello , Dr. Venture . If I could have a moment of your time , I have something amazing to show you ! Security breach ! Security breach ! Damn it ! Houser , where are you ? ! Thank God ! Arrest this ma- - Hey , you 're not my guy . Got about a minute , Doc . Make it count . Hear me out , your Excellency ! If you 're anything like me ... then you 're super concerned about security . Because in these uncertain times , what could be more important ... than the safety of your family , your home ... your country , and your troops on the battlefield ? Down in front , stick ! We were talking here ! Allow me to formally make your acquaintance ... with the Venture Dome , the world 's first fully portable ... battery-powered , invisible force field . Gun ! A microchip ! Microchip ! It 's in the back of his head . His mother is using it to control him ... and she 's going to make him assassinate the President ! It just sounds a little far-fetched . Yeah . Thank you . I 'm glad you said it . What ? Didn 't either of you see The Manchurian Candidate ? Not even the remake with Denzel ? Come on ! I 've been dead for seven score years and even ... - Who is this guy ? - Abraham Lincoln ! 16th President of the United States ! Come on ! You 're kidding me ! Yeah , didn 't you learn anything in bed ? All right . All right , how about this ? I 'm the $ 5.00 bill guy . You invented the $ 5.00 bill ? Yes , Hank . Yes , I did . Dean , you seem a little more on the ball here . - Help me stop Manstrong . - Why do you need us ? Because I 'm immaterial . Look at this. lt 's a no-go . I need to possess one of your bodies just for a little while ... till I can stop him . Will one of you do that for me ? - For the Union ? - Not it ! One , two , three ... nine , ten . Jinx ! You owe me a coke ! You are in for a world of suck , mister . Why are you men lollygagging ? ! - Lock this jackass up ! - They can 't hear you . Sound-proof . - What the Sam-crazy ... - lt 's a force field . - Of my own design . - All right , turn it off , smart face . - You smashed the remote . - Well , unplug it then . Whatever . What am I , an amateur ? It 's battery-powered . - Excellent for armies in the field . - All in a package this small ? - Stand back , sir . - l wouldn 't do that . - They 're ... nuclear batteries . - Nucular ? That 's not actually a word , but , yes ! All right , people , we got a situation here . I 'm gonna need troops ... Not gonna work either . Jams radios , phones , intercoms ... Only on the deluxe model , of course . So , how the hell are we supposed to get out of here ? Well , it 'll run out of juice on it 's own in about ... What 's the half-life on cobalt again ? - 5.24 years . - 5.24 years . Give or take . Yes , yes . Of course , General . You can count on me . Sorry , hon . Gotta work tonight . National emergency . Little man need Ned help ? - Ned protect little man . - No , no , Ned . Thank you . - l won 't be in any danger . - Ned love little man ! OK ! A little too tight , Ned ! Ned give little man the brain vein . It 's OK , Ned . You ready , Captain ? Gassed up and on the runway , Chairman . Don 't wait up , hon . Dude ! What the dilly ? ! Did it work ? What happened ? Honest Abe 's a mo , that 's what happened ! Sorry ! Sorry ! What came over me ? I was just a bit overwhelming having a body again . All those hormones ! All right . Just let me try this again . I 'm ready for it this time . - Who 's Triana , by the way ? - Just get in . - And no funny business . - Yes , already . Like you boys never experimented . Dean ! There . You 're safe now , sir . - l 've secured a perimeter . - That 's great , Houser . You hear that , people ? Nobody crosses this line . You think you could maybe not smoke in here ? - Fine . - Thank you . It 's still going . Now the other one 's caught . Nice one . Everything you touch turns to suck. lt 's official . Oh , no ! They called my brother ? Could this be any more embarrassing ? Yeah , all right , hi . I see you . Go to hell . Well , Doc , can you break it down or what ? Well , I could try to generate an artificial Einstein-Rosen bridge ... but I can 't guarantee we wouldn 't be sucked into another dimension . Well ! Hey , there , nephew ! What are you doing ? That little bastard ! How 'd he do that ? - Gotta go . - What are you trying to do , Dean ? We 're helping our new ghost pal . Ain 't that something ! I wish my boy had that kind of creativity . Colonel Manstrong 's going to assassinate the President ! It 's not really his fault though . His mom 's controlling him . Don 't give me that psycho-babble , son . After a certain age ... a man needs to take responsibility for his own actions . - OK . - Sure ! Maybe if I had hugged my thick-headed son more ... he wouldn 't have started them fires or stolen all that lacrosse equipment ... but , damn it , sometimes they 're just bad apples . Damnation ! Force field ! I didn 't see that one coming . Sorry , Dean . OK , OK . New plan . Well , you just KO 'ed Uncle Sam . Why can 't you just do that to an astronaut and his mom ? That 's not Uncle Sam , it 's me ! Couldn 't lay a glove on it if it weren 't . I can only move things in the material world that bear my image . Wait ! That penny in your pocket , Dean . I was able to get that through the force field . That 's it ! We build a gun made out of pennies ! Exactly ! Wait , no ! That 's insane . But I have another idea . Boys , I need $ 5.00 bills . Scores of them ! Ten score at least . How are we gonna find that many ? How , how ? What are you , an owl ? He can make them with his magic . For the last time , Hank , I 'm a ghost , not a genie . You two must find a way ! Wait ! Does it matter if it 's the new fives or the old ones ? I prefer the new ones . But whatever ! Go , go ! Score ! Thank you , Ambassador Mumbattu . Well , I promised my wife and Jesus I wouldn 't anymore . But things being as they are , well ... Thank you , no , sir . I 'm on duty . - Perimeter ! - Do something . Am I the only one that cares about ... Am I the only one that cares about perimeters ? 'Cause I 'm starting to think I am . And I don 't ... and I don 't like it . Mother 's had a bit too much already . - How about you ? - l don 't drink . - l 'm sorry . - For what ? Lieutenant Baldavich . I didn 't know she was ... your girlfriend . That wasn 't cool . Mr. Samson ... Gargantua-1 was an orbiting metal Eden ... until you sullied it with your Brando-esque sensuality ... and your non-regulation apparel . Sorry doesn 't quite make up for deflowering my Eve . Come on . Enough with the boyscout act . You two were alone on that thing for years . Now , don 't tell me you never hit that . What ? ! I never struck her ! How dare you even imply that I did ! I loved her ! This ain 't good . FDR . Now , he was a real President . I loved to watch him sleep . Weight of the world on his little polio shoulders . The Depression , World War ll . He slept like a baby . Now , that is a clear conscience . This Breyer guy , though , he 's the worst President I 've ever seen . Then why am I wasting my time with this ? Honestly ? I 'm kind of hoping to earn my wings on this deal . So , we 're not just saving the President . - We 're saving you , too ! - My Lincoln sense is tingling ! Manstrong 's making his move ! Hurry , boys ! Svengali ! No , no ! Look , this is not what it looks like . First Anna , now my mother ? ! Have you no shame , you ... You mandingo ! OK , get up ! We 're doing this ! You and me , Samson , right now ! Let 's go ! Come on , man . You know I 'm just gonna beat you stupid . - l 've done it before . - With a sucker punch . This time , school-yard rules . No cheap shots . This is ridiculous . Your mother just ... No mothers ! What ? ! Here comes the Rail Splitter ! What the hell 's going on now ? ! What ? Did my brother make that ? Mr. President , this man 's an assassin programmed to kill you ! There 's a microchip in his brain . Look ! Perimeter , sir ! Perimeter ! Damn it ! Not again ! Stop bothering my son ! Did I graze you , Niblets ? You did it , boys . You saved the President . Go , Team Venture ! You 're supposed to be a doctor . is my Buddy gonna be OK ? Wait a minute. I recognize this . It 's a Venture industries microchip . Hang on a sec . It 's the mother board from Gargantua-1 . Anna ! What are you doing ? ! Restrain yourself ! If we are going to die ... I want to go out with a bang , as they say . I knew it ! Told you this clown was no hero ! He just blacked out in the middle of a hand-job . Someone 's playing with his Lincoln logs . Oh , my God ! It 's full of stars ! Penny for his thoughts . You 're ... still here . Shouldn 't you have crossed over ? Apparently , stopping my bodyguard from beating up a repressed masturbator ... isn 't enough to get you into heaven these days . Go figure . You 're one to judge , Rusty . I seem to remember a certain fast-handed little redhead ... sleeping in the Lincoln bedroom a score and a half years back . - All right . - Not that you did much sleeping . OK . I ... never would have thought that . Don 't know why you people gotta complicate everything . I told y 'all , a little club soda fix most everything . That 's good chowder !

 Chapter Fifteen - Run ! Hello ? Um ... You might not remember me . We ... we haven 't spoken in a long time , but ... I just had ... Our daughter just found me . Did you hear what I just said ? She 's alive . Meredith ? We need to talk . Nathan , are you still there ? It 's ... it 's been 14 years . I went to your funeral . Look , that fire ... it ... it wasn 't an accident . Someone was out to get me , and the police , they just assumed I was dead , so ... I ran . And our daughter ? Well , she 's got an angel on her shoulder , that one . She was adopted by a nice family here in Texas . She 's 16 now . And she 's beautiful . She 's got blond hair , like me . And she is smart , just like you . Maybe one day she 'll run for Congress . The timing of ... your call , two weeks before my election , that ... that 's not a coincidence , is it ? A child born out of wedlock , that 's big news . You wouldn 't want that to come out . Ruin things for you . How much do you want ? - Oh , um ... - $ 100,000 ? Yeah . That oughta cover it . I 'll let you know where to send it . Nice and easy . Mom , are you okay ? - I 've been better . - She 'll be fine . Just needs a little rest . - A little time to recover . - Recover from what ? She , uh , had an appointment with a neurologist , - who ran some tests . - What kind of tests ? Your mother 's been having some headaches . Yeah , she 's also been having some memory loss , did you tell them that ? Of course , Claire . I 'm handling it . Don 't worry , honey , I 'll be fine . Mr. Muggles isn 't worried , is he ? No , he 's not . - D.L. won 't be fooled . - Sure he will . Love is blind , and if last night is any indication , he won 't be able to see anything for a long time . - Nik , baby , I gotta get going . - I 'll be right there . Mm , don 't you look all Secret Service . Is this standard issue for bodyguards ? Bodyguards ? We 're not called " bodyguards " anymore , honey . It 's " private security . " Whatever you want to call it , it 's paying the bills . - Are we ever gonna talk about it ? - Talk about what ? What we can do . Our powers . I just feel like we 're supped to be fighting crime or something . That 's true . But for now , can you just have fun at school , my young genius ? Yep . All right . Baby , there 's a package for you over on the table . Thanks . Are you taking your gun ? It 's the difference between $ 500 and $ 350 a day . My carry permit . You 're not gonna need it , though , right ? I 'm basically a glorified babysitter . - Nothing 's gonna happen . - I hope not . Thank God you called . Playing house is making me cranky . I understand . The guy stole his money . He wants him dead . What Mr. Linderman wants , Mr. Linderman gets . I 'm Malsky . Matt Parkman . Here to protect you , sir . Bang . I 'd like to point out an observation here . Hiro , we 're back in Las Vegas . Right where we started . Only this time ... we have to sneak into Linderman 's hotel ! We have less than two weeks ... to stop the bomb from destroying New York City . Face it , Hiro . It 's a lost cause . Ando . I will never give up . And neither should you . More than everything , a hero must have hope . Fine . You figure out how to get into Linderman 's office ... I will find hope . Excuse me . Are you okay , miss ? Anything we can do to help ? No , I couldn 't possibly ... I mean ... we 're complete strangers . I 'm Ando . This is my friend , Hiro . Hi . I 'm Hope . So . Where are we headed ? Diamond district . Broadway and 6th . What a beautiful day to be in Los Angeles . Look at this weather . And the air ? - What 's your name again ? - Uh , Parkman . - Matt Parkman . - Listen , Parkman . The job is simple . You drive me downtown , we meet a man , I make a deal , then you drive me back to the airport . You just make sure no one bothers me . That includes you . Hope this loser knows how to use his gun . Otherwise , we 're both dead . My name 's Dr. Mohinder Suresh . It 's very important that I speak with him . I assure you , my interest is legitimate . My name is Dr. Mohinder Suresh . It 's really rather complicated to explain over the ... This is Dr. Mohinder Suresh . A certain genetic trait ... Hello ? Have you noticed anything unusual about his behavior ? My name is Dr. Mohinder Suresh . Are you still there ? One new message . Hi . This is , uh , Zane . Zane Taylor . Z-A-N-E Taylor . I , uh , I got your phone message . And , um , something is happening to me . I can 't control it . I ... I think we need to talk . Please hurry . Can you come see me right away ? It 's really , um- - Five minutes , ladies . Five minutes . We 've dated for a few months . Um ... he lives in L.A. , comes to visit . And at first , he was really sweet . But ... now he 's ... just horrible . He even hit me once . - Your boyfriend did this to you ? - I 'm sorry . I left this morning while he was sleeping . But I forgot my bag . It 's ... It 's pink and it has rhinestones on it and it 's got all my money and my credit cards and it even has my family photos in it that I can 't replace . I should go up there and talk to him . - Maybe he won 't be so mad . - No . - We will do it . - Eh ? Excuse us , please . What about our mission ? He hit her . She can 't go back there . We 'll sneak in . Get her bag ... You want to break inot a hotel room and steal a bag ? - You said I needed to find Hope . It 's a sign ! - It 's a coincidence ! Why is it that whenever you want to do something ... it 's our destiny . But when I want to do something , it 's not important . - Charlie ... Linderman ... - Charlie was special . Hang on . Did you two say something about Mr. Linderman ? Yes . You know him ? Well , not personally , but everybody knows who he is . - Um , I know people who do . - That 's great . She can help us ! If we get your bag , can you introduce us ? Yeah , I can do that . We still have a problem . How do we get past security ? I have an idea . - Who 's there ? - Room service . - I didn 't order room service . - Ah ! Complimentary for high roller . Ah , very nice room . How are you today ? You 're done . This is a terrible idea . All because you like this girl . " A hero does not have regrets . " We 're wasting time . I should just go to Linderman 's office without you . We need to go . Now . Why ? Did you find Hope 's bag ? " A hero never runs . " Stop saying the things I say to you ! We have to leave ! No . All this time , I have trusted you . Now , it 's your turn to trust me . I have no powers . " A man does not need powers to be a hero . " We 'll call the police . Come on . We 're leaving ! Now ! Fine . Ando ! Please hurry . Oh , God . Hurry ... Hurry . Please hurry . Please hurry ... Dr. Suresh ? Yes . Yes . Thank God . Man , come in . Come in . I was starting to think you weren 't going to show . I didn 't know what I was gonna do . I mean , look at what I 'm living with . Yes , I see what you mean . I 'm just a regular guy . I mean ... I 've never been different or ... or special , or ... I mean , no one would even look at me twice walking down the street . I guess I should show you . Right ? What I do , you need to see it , right ? - Yes , of course . - Okay . I haven 't left the apartment for three weeks . I 'm going a little crazy . Maybe you should step back . It can get a little messy . We reap what we sow , Nathan . You have no one to blame but yourself . I 'll go down to Texas and handle it . So close to the election ? Don 't be ridiculous . If the press gets wind of this , especially on the heels of the Linderman scandal ... I cared about Meredith once . I owe her more than a phone call . I owe them both . Besides . I 'm this girl 's father , come on . You 're a glorified sperm donor . Don 't get emotionally attached . - How can you be so cold ? - Because I know you , Nathan . Beneath the gruff exterior , you 're a sap . The moment that young girl looks at you with her sad little weepy eyes , you 're lost , you 're finished . You 'll start giving , and she 'll start taking untithere 's nothing left . So prioritize , Nathan . Wire the money to Texas . Focus on the people who really matter . How 's Mom ? Your mother 's resting . So I understand you and Zach cut school yesterday . Mom said we could . It was for our report . - We went to the aquarium . - With these tickets ? Printed from your computer ? - These fake tickets , Claire ? - You 're spying on me ? I don 't know where you were , and I don 't want to know . You 're a teenager , you need to assert your independence . But this behavior ... It 's unacceptable . You 're grounded , young lady . You 're to be home every day at 5 : 00 sharp until further notice . What ? You can 't do that ! You have no right . - I 'm your father . - You 're not my real father . No , I 'm not . But I 'm as close as you 've got . So you 'll stay home at night . Until you earn our trust back . - Hello ? - Hi . It 's me , Claire . Do you have a second to talk about my father ? Oh , hey , Claire . I 'm glad you called . Talk about coincidence . I found your father . You 're kidding . What 'd he say ? Well , after he got over the shock that we were both alive , he was actually kinda sweet . Said he 'd be happy to help us out . Sounded real generous , too . Says he 's gonna fly right down from New York . Well , I want to meet him . Oh , right . Well ... well , I-I don 't know about that . - But he 's my father . - Right . Well , um ... Why don 't I talk to him , and we 'll see what he says . You know what , Claire ? I actually have to go . But , um , I 'll call you later , all right ? I love you . I 've got the money . Let 's see the diamonds . Stones range from 2 to 9 carats . My offer is more than generous . Not that it matters . Linderman 's guy ... will be here soon . You won 't get out alive . Sir . Sir , please . Please . We have gotta get out of here right now . This is a setup . - What ... how do you know that ? - I just do . You have to trust me . You 've got a deal . I gotta run . - Who 's Linderman ? - My ex-employer . - How do you know his name ? - Never mind that . Why has he sent someone here to kill you ? Because I stole his $ 2 million . Should 've been out of the country by now . Great . You stole the money . How do you know ? Wait a second . You gotta get me out of here . Take this . There 's another one for you when you get me out . - No , you can 't bribe me . - I don 't want to die . Two in the bodyguard . Then Malsky gets one in the gut . Two in the bodyguard . Two in the bodyguard . Then Malsky gets one in the gut . She 's in there . This should be fun . I do all the work , he takes half the profit . I 'm sick of it . No , I got these two Chinese guys to help me out . Turned on the waterworks and they were mine . Yep ... They 're getting the suitcase as we speak . All right . I 'll catch the bus from Primm and meet you in Barstow . I love you too , Leon . Oh , hi ! I didn 't see you come in . You were on telephone . Uh , with my mom . So , um ... Where 's the bag ? We are not Chinese . - We are Japanese . - Whatever . Where 's ... the bag ? You are a bad person . You may have fooled Ando , but you do not fool me . Thanks for the help , Sulu . What are you doing ? We can 't stop here . Keep moving . All right , this way , this way ! This way ! Come on ! Come on ! Okay ... Go to the elevator . You can 't do this . - You have to stop ! - Don 't worry , Niki . I don 't plan on being Little Miss Homemaker forever . Just gotta lay low for a while . You 're chasing two men with a gun in broad daylight . You call that laying low ? This is my life . My child ! - You can 't do this ! - I have to . Somebody 's gotta repay Linderman . You made the deal to get me out of jail ? I couldn 't leave it up to you now , could I ? The elevator 's not coming . - Who are you calling ? - Backup . You can 't bring the cops into this ! Terry , hey ! It 's Parkman . I 'm working security ... Diamond District . 6th and Broadway . I got a shooter , possibly two . Send everyone you got . Come on ! All right , you go to the other side of the building . Cops will be here soon . I 'll buy us some time . Drop your weapon . Over the side , right now . Okay , where 's your partner ? Partner ? Come on ... Your partner ! I heard you arguing with her . Niki , right ? Where is she ? - You heard Niki ? - Where is she ? She 's probably killing Malsky ... right now . Fourth one over , third one back . Fourth one over , third one back . Hey , there you are . Come on , let 's go ! Me again . Ahh ! No ! Don 't ! Hey , Claire . What are you doing here ? I have to see my father . You don 't understand . I 'll wait here all night if I have to . Why don 't we take a walk ? It 's my mom ... She 's sick . I think it 's bad . Oh , I 'm so sorry . How can I help ? You said my father had money . You said he had power and that he wanted to help us . - I thought maybe he could ... - Oh , honey , honey ... I didn 't mean that kind of help . I mean just money . I don 't understand . Your daddy ... He 's , um ... How do I explain this ? He 's ... When your daddy found out that I was pregnant with you ... What I 'm trying to say is that you can 't count on him . He 'll give us cash because that 's easy . But anything else , he 'll just disappoint you . He doesn 't even want to meet me ? Oh , Claire . Please . Why 'd you even tell me about him ? Because he wants to give us some money . $ 50,000 , and you 're entitled to half of that . I don 't want his money . I , uh , I 'm heading back to Mexico for a while . So we 're probably not gonna see each other . I want you to take real good care of yourself , okay ? Hang on . So I can remember that sweet face . Police ! Get your hands up ! I 'm on the ... I 'm on the job . - Hello . Zane Taylor ? - Yes . You must be Dr. Suresh . Come on in . Can I get you some tea ? - Sorry it took me so long to get here . - No , it 's no problem . Is Earl Grey okay ? Yes , that 'll be fine . You , um ... sounded rather alarmed on the phone . You seemed to have calmed down some . I had a kind of epiphany about it this morning . Are you familiar with Abraham Maslow , the peak experience ? I 'm afraid not . It 's , um ... A single moment that takes you out of yourself . Makes you feel very tiny or very large . To some extent , one with life or nature or God . I see ... Like seeing all the pieces of a puzzle fit together . All this time , I was trying to fight it . Deny it . But there is no shame in having this ability , is there ? None whatsoever . - It would be like denying you have brown eyes . - Right . So , um ... I guess that you ... You want to see my ability . Yes ! I mean , I 'm quite anxious to document it . You might want to step back . That looks like a nice jacket . My God ! You want to see it again ? Look , for what it 's worth , I 'm sorry for the way things turned out . You know , I could 've been a ... A much better person back then . You politicians , you sure know your way around an apology . You and me , we were never gonna work out . - Two diff ... - Different worlds . - Yeah . I , uh ... I hope this goes a long way toward making up for the fact that I wasn 't there . For both of you . So ... Where is she ? - Claire ? - Mm-hmm . You just missed her . - Did she want to see me ? - Yeah . I snapped a photo of her . Look how beautiful she is . I 'm ... I 'm sure she is . Take a look , Nathan . She came here with her bags all packed . She thought you were gonna rescue her from her tragic life . That sound familiar ? I told her you 're just here to pay your money and go . Did I speak out of turn ? I could call her . I could get her to come back . You did fine . You did just fine . I should probably be heading back to my family . Just the kids . I 'm very interested in how you control this ... ability . Well , it 's , like ... Riding a bike for the first time . It 's a little wobbly . And then I discovered something . A kind of peace . A sense of purpose that can only be described as destiny . I 'd like to take a DNA sample . From me , okay . Um , sure . Just swab it on the inside of your mouth . The tea . - If you 'll excuse me for a second . - Of course . - I just swab it on the inside of my cheek ? - Yes , that 's right . There you go . - DNA sample . - Thank you . You know ... You should be careful who you talk to about this ability , Zane . There 's some people who might not understand . Who might want to hurt you . Why would anybody want to hurt me ? I don 't know yet . But I do know this ... There are others out there like you . Really ? How many others ? Dozens . And those are just the ones I know about . With more time and research , I could find hundreds , thousands ! But , uh ... You 're the first one who 's returned my phone calls . But I am going to find them . All of them . I could go with you . I could help you . Think about it . These people could need convincing . Who better to do that ? - Ando , over here ! - Hope ! You got it . My hero . I was trapped under a bed . Your boyfriend is very large . You mean ex-boyfriend . Come on . I need a ride to Primm . My mom 's house . I 'm sure she would love to meet you . Where ... Where 's Hiro ? Oh , um , I took him to meet the guy who could introduce him to Mr. Linderman . - He didn 't wait for me ? - He said he didn 't really need you anymore . But I didn 't even give you your bag yet . Why didn 't you wait for me ... Three 's a crowd , baby . We gotta go . One . Two . Three . Ando ? Is that you ? I 'm locked in ! She 's an awful woman ! And so strong ! She punched me ! You 're not Ando . S.R. Gustavson , State Gaming Commission . I come in peace . I only saw the blonde ... Yes . But I heard them talking . I know there were two of them . I 'm telling you , she was incredibly strong . She ... She ... She broke my handcuffs . Any idea where the diamonds are ? - You didn 't find the case ? - No . I guess the incredibly strong killer and her partner must 've taken it . Fourth one over , third one back . Fourth one over , third one ... What a joke . Parkman . What a joke . Can 't even do a decent job as a rent-a-cop . He 'll never wear a police badge again in his life . Parkman ... You okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm good . Mom , I 'm home ! To survive in this world , we hold close to us those people on whom we depend . We trust in them our hopes , our fears . Go away , you ! Mom , what 's going on ? This mangy thing came at me out of nowhere . I think it has rabies . Go away ! Scat ! Mom , this is your dog , Mr. Muggles . You love him . I don 't have a dog . I don 't know any Mr. Muggles . And I don 't know you . But what happens when trust is lost ? Where do we run when things we believe in vanish before our eyes ? It 's time . Micah , did I get another package ? Yeah , it 's in your bedroom . Thanks . I 'm opening it now . When all seems lost , the future unknowable , our very existence in peril ... Yeah , I remember him . Hmm . Not a problem . Consider it done . All we can do ... is run . Thanks to Raceman for the Transcript Subtitles Made By The Bloc Team

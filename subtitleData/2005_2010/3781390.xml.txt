 You want Wassenfelder , you have to deal . Ten of you will accept our sincere thanks and go home tomorrow . I think you 're making a big mistake . Good-bye , Maddux Donner . This is gonna be my marker - an eagle . It 's a good omen . There 's some weird physiological changes happening to you guys that I 'm not supposed to talk about . We don 't want anyone to see the gamma object . We 've been working on a 50 / 50 plan . This one will be the real images , and this would be the cover recordings of Zoe picking up the rocks . Mintz wants me to examine every moment of my miracle with Hector . Miracles are reality with parts missing . Here we go . Donner , you have got to get it close . - He 's going to miss . - Contact . How far from the object ? 286 meters . That 's too far . We got 20 minutes to get off that planet . Did she just say " baby " ? Zoe , what are you doing ? I can get it , Donner . My father used to say that if whiskey was courage in a bottle , there 'd be a national monument in his name . His point , other than he drank too much , was that courage isn 't something you can buy . It 's something you find . Are you hearing it , Donner ? No , I-I 'm not hearing anything , Zoe , but you need to turn around and come back to the lander . Do you copy ? Zoe , turn around and come back to the lander . Not without the baby . There isn 't a baby . You 're on Venus . Have we muted their comm ? Right after the missed landing . That exchange was clear . And the recorded E.V.A. ? Up and running . Go to it . Um , Paula , we need a live shot of you on the flight deck to make the transition to the recording . Paula ? Yes , copy that . Wass ? Yeah , I 'm on it . I 'm ready . You may have noticed that Zoe has very little mobility in her pressure suit ... It 's obviously a hallucination . Was she hearing the baby on the ship ? Due to the vulnerability ... She said it was guilt-related . Did she tell you the reason ? No . She never told me . Why would she be hallucinating a baby ? She aborted one her first year of training . And I wasn 't told ? There are certain personal decisions that I think should remain personal . Her boots were specially designed to pick up dirt instead of repel it . All Zoe has to do is walk around a little ... and cut to the recording . and then step on the sled that she 's been towing behind her and deposit any of the samples that her boots have collected . Anyone bothered by the black boulder that just appeared 100 meters out in the fake footage ? 11 : 00 . It 's small . Can we edit it on the fly ? Maybe from this point on . We 'll see what they can do . Think I 'm getting some pretty good samples here , although I 'm not sure my mother would approve of my dirty feet . Can you pull up the helmet cam , please ? Donner , I need for you to get her back on the lander now . That suit is only good for 20 minutes . Ted , she 's hearing a baby . I - she 's not listening to me . Zoe , there 's no baby . Repeat-there is no baby . Now get back to the lander . I can hear it . I can get it . You 're hallucinating . Is this the same thing that you were hearing on the ship ? It 's not on the ship anymore . It 's here . - Zoe . - Oh , crap . Listen ... what the hell are you doing ? She 's getting a tattoo , Donner . A big tattoo . Big tattoo of what ? An eagle . The omen eagle ? You know about the omen eagle ? Isn 't that the reason she 's leaving ? No-no , it 's not the reason I am leaving . I was asked to leave . I got kicked out . Not by me . No , not by you , Donner . This isn 't about you . This is about me . It 's about where I 'm going . Lady , you need to sit still . This eagle on my back-it marks a turning point in my life , all right ? There is pre-eagle and there is post-eagle . You , Donner , are pre-eagle . I 'm here now . So I 'm mid-eagle too . I can 't do this right now . Guys , can you take Donner home ? I 'm not going home . I 'm seeing her to the station . Okay , so meet us at the train station . I was just there . So go back . She doesn 't want you here , all right ? We 'll be there in a couple of hours . You can say good-bye then . Rollie , please ? Uh , I 'm your ride . Right . Ajay , please ? Sure . Donner , I guess we should go . Huh ? And , um ... I would never say anything . Well , you might . I mean , you could . Destiny , a man 's right to know , whatever , But you ... don 't . I won 't . Thank you . After you . Ajay , how long has she been out ? Seven minutes . All systems on her suit are nominal . She 's 150 meters from the lander . She 's got three minutes to turn around , or she 's not making it back . OK , Zoe , you gotta listen to me now . This gamma object has got you hearing things . I know what I 'm hearing , Donner . No , you don 't . You don 't know what you 're hearing because there is no baby on Venus . Turn around right now , or you 're not gonna make it back to the ship . Do you understand ? I need you to get me a private comm with her . If you think you can get through , hook in with Donner . No Donner . Just me and Zoe . I need to speak to her privately . Do it . Venus lander , this is " Antares . " I need you to jump off this comm . I 'm a little busy here , Ted . Jen thinks she can get through to her . Doesn 't want anyone else on the line . She doesn 't want me on the line ? She doesn 't want anyone . All right . Going to 6 . Mission control , do you copy ? Let her try privately . Roger that . We 're moving to channel 6 with Donner . It 's all yours . Hey , Zoe , it 's Jen . Do you copy ? Jen ? Is that you ? Yeah . I got us on a private comm so we could have a little girl talk . You hear what I finally came up with ? Yeah . Marking the day with a footprint . It 's nice . It 's really nice . A footprint 's easier than a tattoo . Yeah . Well , it 's not looking so easy right now , Zoe . I 'm gonna make it , Jen . Only if you turn back right now , Zoe . That suit is certified for 20 minutes on Venus - not 25 , not 30 . I hear the baby . But that 's the hallucination . You know that . No . This is different . It 's not your baby , Zoe . I know that you think it is , but it 's not . Your baby 's gone . You 're wrong . It 's right up ahead . No , no , no . This isn 't you . Zoe , please . Can you hear yourself ? Hey , that thing is making you hear the baby . It wants to kill you . I 'm gonna get it . It 'll be okay . Where you 're going , there is no coming back . There 's no pre-eagle . There 's no post-eagle . There 's just ... nothing . Please don 't leave us . Don 't do this . We need you on the ship . Please , Zoe , turn back now . Zoe ? You did the best you could . She 's gonna die out there . And if Donner tries to wait for her , so will he . No . We can 't let him do that . This isn 't Mars . No , it 's not , but it sure feels that way . Passing a probe now . That 's the Chinese attempt from ' 43 . She 's now at 200 meters , still outbound . Ten minutes on the surface . No return . If they want us to retrieve them , why the hell do they keep killing us ? She 's not dead yet , Mike . In fact , she 's our only hope . Hey , Z , I 'm back . Copy that , Donner . How 's Jen ? You guys have a nice talk ? I 'm not turning around . I see that . You just passed your no-return . Yeah , my heads-up is flashing . I 'm choosing to ignore it . Does Jen have some idea why you 're hearing a baby ? 'Cause I can 't help but think that if I knew the answer to that , I could talk you back here . Yeah , I don 't think so , Donner . I don 't get women . I mean , I get women . I - I don 't get women . I think aside from the obvious ways , they 're really not that much different than you and I. No , wrong . They 're way different . What if you were the Ascan who didn 't make the cut ? Would you just hang out and wait for Zoe ? No . I 'm not-I 'm not gonna have the failure rubbed in my face . Exactly . You wouldn 't wait around , and neither would I. Well , I wouldn 't get a damn tattoo . Maybe she needed it - like a ritual , a way to say good-bye . I can think of a lot of ways that are less painful and permanent . I think the pain and the permanence are the whole reason she did it . These last few months , they 've been really emotional for Zoe . It 's not like I 'm responsible . Are you saying I 'm responsible for that ? How am I responsible for that ? Another failed probe . Those were ours she just passed . Were those ours ? Yeah . We sent two . Where 'd they launch from ? Canaveral . Canaveral 's underwater . I guess they can cover up anything . Barnes will now drag her sled back to its dock then go on to the platform that will lift her into the lander . So far , this has been a textbook mission . She 's 20 meters to target . Time ? Poe , I need to know her surface time . Uh , 16 minutes , 37 seconds . Thermal cooling is coming off nominal . We should start to see seal failures in five minutes . The lander ? " Crossbow 's " T.C.S. is also subnominal . Internal temperature 's 25 degrees Celsius and rising fast . Donner , you 're gonna have to switch to your suit pack soon . Uh , roger that . It is getting hot in here . I also need you to think about your launch sequence . I 'll think about it . We 're gonna hold off on that for now . You 're gonna have to be ready when she goes down , Maddux . Yeah , I heard you the first time , Rollie . Okay ? I get it . And it 's not Mars . I got that , too . But I 'm the guy that missed this landing . There was a crosswind . That doesn 't matter . That was my responsibility . And it 's my responsibility to make sure that she gets every chance possible to get back . I owe her that much . Copy that . You know , he said this isn 't Mars , but it 's exactly what happened on Mars . Then you have to stop him ! Ted , you do . Talk some sense into him . Don 't let this happen again ! Donner , listen , buddy . Hey , you 're really making us nervous up here . So what I need you to do is I need you to get back on - When she goes down , I 'll go . Till then , she gets every chance . Once inside , Donner will have the hatch sealed , then depressurize and cool off the lower compartment . Zoe 's suit will depressurize on the way back to the ship . We all have to start getting ready for Zoe and Donner 's return . I hope you all are as excited and as happy and proud as we all are . From " Antares , " I am Paula Morales signing off . We 're all very proud of you . You did a great job . That was a fairy tale . It 's the way we wanted it to be ... just not the way it is . I need some air . Paula ... Flight , be advised she 's running a low-grade fever . Her suit temperature ? Nominal . This fever is consistent with the beta hallucinations . She 's approaching the target . The Ascan eliminations - how 'd we do ? Aside from Wassenfelder , you did pretty good . Barnes ? That 's a surprise . I haven 't been able to sleep the last couple of nights . Yeah , well , that should probably tell you something . I have no idea who else I 'd get rid of . Oh , I 'm sure that can 't be easy . I tell myself , you know , maybe she 's lucky . Maybe I just gave her a chance to live a normal life . She would never think that . No . Sharon Lewis wouldn 't have thought that , either . Buy you dinner ? Tonight I would like a little normal . For the record , I think they screwed up not picking you . Thanks , Rollie . It 's just my opinion . Looks good . Thanks . That was sweet . Odd , but sweet . Yeah . Rollie is a good man , and he has a huge crush on you . Yeah , but I got this whole Ted mess . That 's sex , not a relationship . Well , maybe I don 't want a relationship . We all do . Nadia doesn 't . Nadia 's different . Nadia knows that relationships lead to things . Yeah , like feelings . Yeah , and compromise . And babies . And pain . Relationships also lead to pain . Yes . Yes , they do . Please tell me we 're almost done . Almost done . And relationships end . Honey , they don 't have to . I just want to know if I 'm post-eagle . I 'm gonna be post-eagle , right ? Come on . That 's 20 minutes on the surface . Donner needs to get off . He will get off when the time is right . The lander 's going to start falling apart ! It won 't make it back to the ship ! Donner , you need to start your launch sequence . Nadia - Donner ! Stand by , " Antares . " just a few more minutes . Not a few more minutes ! Now , Donner , now ! Start your launch sequence ! Donner ! She 's stopping . She 's at the site . I can see it . Uh ... It 's here . My baby 's here . She 's seeing it as a baby . He 's coming to me . He 's floating up to me . Oh , Zoe . Zoe , it 's amazing . Zoe , listen , as soon as you have it , you need to start back for the lander . Do you copy ? Roger that . 20 minutes on the surface . Thermal cooling is starting to fail . Internal temperature in the suit is 40 degrees centigrade . That 's 104 Fahrenheit . That 's the same thing on the lander . I have him in my arms . I ... I have him in my arms . All right , go ! Go for the lander ! Hurry ! She 's got it . She 's got gamma . Doesn 't matter . She 'll never make it . We don 't know that . Come on . I 'm coming , Donner ... Coming with our baby . I 'm coming with our baby boy . " Our baby " ? Zoe 's burst cyst in the first year of training was a botched abortion . And Donner was the father ? Yeah . Ugh . Damn . He 'd had a vasectomy after Mars . It somehow reverted . We discovered it on his last physical . Do you think he realizes ? Uh , control , I 'd like to get a private comm with Ajay . I have a couple of questions about the lander . He realizes . Talk to him on 6 . He 's not gonna leave without her . I think I get that . Donner , go to 6 . Aje ? You there ? I 'm here , Donner . Hey . Uh , do you remember me telling you I 'd been snipped ? Claire told us it somehow reverted . Yeah . Uh ... This whole deal with Zoe , uh ... that cyst thing the first year ... wasn 't really a cyst , was it ? That 's correct , Maddux . It 's my baby . Yes . It 's my rule . What is ? It 's the reason Zoe 's leaving . It 's my " I don 't screw astronauts " rule . I mean , you know , the part that 's-that 's ... About that . I get it . I get it . I get the tattoo , you know ? When I got back from Mars , you know what I did first thing ? What ? I got a vasectomy . I got snipped . You got a vasectomy ? Yeah . That 's painful , permanent . You know why I did it ? I did it because I didn 't want a wife . I didn 't want kids . I didn 't want anybody to have to go through what I experienced with losing Sharon . When you do this thing that we do , death 's just part of the deal . So don 't screw astronauts . Don 't have kids . You have one-night stands . That 's my life . You know ? Thus my rule . Okay . Well , I 'm gonna need some help holding this go-kart together 'cause there 's no way in hell I 'm leaving here without her . Roger that . Zoe , how we doing ? It 's getting a little warm out here , but we 're doing fine . Well , you just keep on moving . This bus isn 't going anywhere without you two . All right , how 's she doing ? Not great-dehydrated , heart rate 's through the roof . Why would these things go through so much trouble just-just to kill us ? See , that 's the thing that 's been bothering me . That 's what thing ? Well , that there 's no logic to that . I mean , maybe it 's some kind of test . Maybe - Maybe the whole idea is that it isn 't supposed to be easy . It 's like the trials of Job . The devil took everything from Job , hoping he 'd renounce his faith . Yeah , but-yeah , but he didn 't , right ? No , Steven . He didn 't . Okay , her suit 's off nominal in all areas - servo motors , thermal cooling - seals are close to going . What 's her distance to the lander ? 150 meters . At least another 7 minutes . Ideas ? Come on ! Ideas , people ! Ajay , spitball with me here for a second . If the cooling systems are working too hard , maybe we back ' em off a notch or two And just let the internal temp rise . No , the heat could kill her . She 's working a lot harder than you are , Donner . With less temperature differential , the seals might last longer . We need to do anything we can to give her more time . What 's the suit temp now ? 43 centigrade . I 'll let her go to 49 . That 's 120 Fahrenheit-no more . What about you , Donner ? Don 't worry about the lander . I got my suit . We 'll let you take it to 60 , Donner , but that 's the limit . Do it . All right . Zoe , listen , we 're gonna crank the thermostat up here to give the T.C.S. a breather , so it 's gonna get hot . I 'm already hot , Donner . I think I 'm gonna puke . Oh , don 't do that . You don 't get a bucket if you 're already an astronaut . Yeah , well , what the hell ? I 'm not gonna have to clean this suit . All right , stop talkin and start walkin ' . You waited . How 's your back ? Sore beyond words ... which is a good thing . It 's a fitting end to an era . A period at the end of a sentence ? More like a painful exclamation point . Look - No . No " looks , " Donner . No regrets . I just - You and I will always be connected in some strange way I can 't explain , usually involving too many drinks and vomit . I 'm wearing my bucket . No , I was just gonna say that , uh ... I hope we stay in touch . Let me know where you land ? Eastbound express , Spokane , Fargo , Minneapolis ... That would be me . That 's a nice trip . I 've taken it before . It 's a nice ride . I had a hard time pulling my eyes away from the window . Yeah , it 's not a bad planet , is it ? No . No , it 's not . And there are no cows on Venus . That 's right . Have fun up there , Donner . Sure . Zoe ? Zoe , you 're gonna make it back here to me . All right , Zoe , come on . Hurry . She 's 100 meters out . You copy ? I need you to push . Come on , Zoe , come on . Come on . Go , Zoe ! Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on , Zoe . Go , Zoe . Go , Zoe ! Go ! Come on , Zoe ! Come on . 50 meters from the lander . Go , Zoe . Keep pushing . We have a breach in the suit . Left arm servos are failing . How far out is she ? 5 meters . Don 't breathe . Get in the cage . Zoe , you can 't breathe . Hold your breath . She 's down . No . No , no , no , no , no . Come on . Get up ! Get up ! Zoe , get in the cage ! You are so close . Come on . Don 't breathe . Get in the cage . She 's in . She 's in ! Donner , pull her up ! How bad is the breach ? Not complete . 93 centigrade . Heart 's still beating . Does she still have gamma ? - Still in her arms . - She 's in . The door 's closed . Donner , go ! Get the hell off that planet ! Roger that . Zoe ? Zoe ? Zoe ? Help me . Okay , let 's-let 's get her out of the suit And up to the med bay . Zoe ? Zoe , we 're right here , honey . We 've got you . You 're gonna be okay . You 're gonna be okay . All right , you got her ? Let 's get the object . 1 , 2 , 3 . Surgeon ? Zoe , stay with us . Thready pulse . Weak BP . I 'm seeing lung damage , severe dehydration , second and third degree burns over half of her body . She really shouldn 't be alive . Odds of survival ? I don 't know . Guess . 20 % . And another one bites the dust . Shut up ! I 'm just saying . You shut your mouth , Arnel ! I don 't want to hear one more word coming out of it ! Not one ! Do you understand me ? She did it . Can 't you understand that ? Yes , she did , and for those of you who can 't recognize it , that was courage-from both of them . And that is what we aspire to . Okay . It 's in . Wass ? Yeah ? Would you call this a miracle ? As close as I 've ever seen . She saw it as a baby in her arms . Yeah . Maybe it 's some kind of shape-shifter thing . So her memory of the miracle has a baby in it . I see what you 're saying . Subjective / objective . I think it 's exactly what you said before ... that we see what we want to see . But it still happened . Or it 's like Zoe 's phony walk on Venus ... and it 's all just a fairy tale . Cameras had five different shots , and none of them were up top . It 's ridi - Where is everybody ? Should have been off shift an hour ago . Then go onto the platform ... Three . That will lift her into the lander . So far , this has been a textbook mission . Okay , we need to push saline , dress her burns and get her into the chamber . Jen , I need an epi-patch ready in case she arrests . Copy that . You . Hey , I only did it 'cause she asked me to . I don 't want trouble . No , no . No trouble . Listen , where can I get a tattoo so that when I 'm in a locker room , Nobody can see it ? Only two good places , friend , and they both hurt . Gently , gently . Good . All right . Nadia . I have the dressing , please .

It is if you are from New Orleans . Trust me . It 's nice to cook for someone . Oh , it 's really nice to be cooked for .

Yeah , sure , but part of me was hoping that she would give up and bring you home . Well , I can 't say I haven 't had those same thoughts , you know ? It 's like we 're ... we 're moving away from normal . I have this feeling that I 'm never gonna taste your crawfish etouffee again . Mama , I 'm home . Hector . Your mom isn 't here , angel . She 'll be home at 5 : 00 . Mm ! All hail the conquering heroes ! Hey , I 'm buying for anyone who can estimate exactly how much each ounce of Venus dust cost the taxpayer . Oh , come on . Regale me with tales of human conquest . Ajay ? Not tonight , Trevor . Just watch the replay . Something happen ? It was a textbook mission . All right . .. the sled that she 's been towing behind her Thanks for today . You were really great . Hey , I had the truck , after all . Oh , no . No , this was about a lot more than a truck . You came through for Zoe ... For me . Yeah , that 's me , all right . Mr. Steady . Do you lie ? Rarely . Cheat ? No . It 's not my nature . A regular stand-up guy . It 's a way of life . Koop Memorial Hospital . Um , yes . I 'm looking for the victim of a hit-and-run accident . She was brought in a couple of nights ago . A blonde woman in her 20s . No , I don 't know her name . I was the driver . Flight surgeon private comm , channel 6 . How 's the vibe ? A little weird . There is a sense of accomplishment , but no one 's really celebrating , not with Zoe in trouble . She should be dead . Yeah . Adrenaline does strange things . This wasn 't adrenaline . It wasn 't the object . And this was too close . The object would 've done more . Unless it 's trying to test us , push us to the edge of our capabilities . Why would it do that ? Why would God test Job ? Look , we have no idea what these genetic changes are or how they influence our bodies . Maybe it 's a helper , a little booster to get us over the hump . Miracles have explanations . You 're sure about that ? I 'm a scientist , not a priest . I got you some ice cream . Caramel swirl . We can have some after we play . You 're so shy today . I don 't know where it is you find courage . There isn 't a map . It kind of follows the road of emotion ... there . You got your bucket . .. to pick up dirt instead of repel it . All Zoe has to do is walk around a little , and then step on the thread that she 's been towing behind her ... Sometimes stopping near conviction and anger ... .. that her boots have collected . Other times parking besides fear . Paula ? I wanna kiss those eyes . Kiss those eyes . Paula , are you okay ? Courage plays no favourites ... Takes no sides . It can be as impressive as a walk on Venus ... or as simple as a kiss . Paula ! Paula ! Hector ! Hector , no ! No . Hector ! Hail , Mary , full of grace . The lord is with thee . Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . Holy Mary , mother of god , pray for us sinners , now and at the hour of our death . Amen . Commander Crane ? And sometimes in our darkest hours ... courage is all we have . Paula ? He 's alive .

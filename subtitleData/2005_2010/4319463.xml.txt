 Strange lights in the sky , a creepy sounding village and a radio telescope . There 's something in the woods . My dad 's been offered a new job ... in America . Oh , no ! It is you who are in peril . Trigger a nuclear chain reaction that will wipe out all life ? I won 't let you ! No ! Sarah Jane ! Ah ! She lives . She is my prize to take back to Sontar once Earth is destroyed . There , she will pay for the Doctor 's crimes . We 'll stop you ! You might be a Sontaran , but you 're only one ! One Sontaran is all it takes ! Secure her with the other female ! Luke , we really have to do something ! Your species ' biology is primitive . Laboratory analysis at my ship could provide valuable information for the High Command . Clyde ! Over here ! Ah ! See you , Spud ! Argh ! I will fry your blood , Half-Form ! Boy , that guy has a big case of little man complex ! SHE SCREAMS Which way ? This way ! I can 't see ! Just keep running . Faster , he 'll catch us ! How far does this bunker go ? Miles . In 45 minutes this place could come in really handy ! YARGH ! I think I took a wrong turn . Sorry . YARGH ! YARGH ! It 's stuck ! Clyde ! We have to get it open ! First time in my life I wish I carried a lipstick ! Help me with this . BANGING FROM DOOR YARGH ! I reckon that is a toad in the hole ! Come on . Where 's Clyde ? I don 't know , Dad locked you in . What 's happened to him ? He 's acting like some sort of robot . He 's being controlled by an alien , a Sontaran . And if we don 't get out of here , it 's going to destroy the world . My bag ! My sonic lipstick ! Your what ? If only Luke were here . We 'll just have to manage on our own , won 't we ? You and Maria moving to America , I just can 't get my head around it . If I take the job . Looks like someone 's doing all right , anyway . Changed your car ? Oh , it 's Ivan 's . I just borrowed it . Don 't change the subject . I mean it , Alan , it would be weird not having you here . We get on much better as friends than we did as husband and wife . I 'll miss you . If I go . Of course you 'll go . You live for work you always did . It 's what you never understood , Chrissie . I live for Maria . I lived for Maria and you . That 's all work was ever about . Looking after the two of you . That 's why whatever I do , it has to be right for Maria . MOBILE PHONE RINGS Dad ! You have to help us ! Maria , slow down . What 's happened ? We 're at the Tycho Radio Telescope , near a village called Goblin 's Copse . Sarah Jane 's been captured by a Soltaran . We 've got 40 minutes before it destroys Earth . You have to help us talk to Mr Smith . A jamming device ? Something that will interfere with the radio telescope . And we 're going to build it ? What 's wrong , haven 't you inherited any scientific aptitude from your father ? Yeah . But if we jam the telescope won 't they be able to trace the source ? Exactly . Where are you going , Alan ? Not Mary Jane 's ? I have to do something for Maria . Get Ivan 's car back before he finds out you 've " borrowed " it . What about Maria ? Maria 's fine , she 's just she left her library book with Sarah Jane it has to go back today , that 's all . All right . We 've got to talk this American thing through properly . Like a family . Of course . Mr Smith ? Mr Smith ? I need you . Oh , Mr Jackson , this is a surprise . It 's that sort of a day . MOBILE PHONE RINGS Dad ? Some people never learn . Sontarans are a clone-species originating from the planet Sontar . They are fearless , well trained , strategically intellectual , and immensely strong . But they can be beaten ? They must have a weakness . Sontarans do not eat food . They intake pure energy by means of a probic vent at the base of their skull . This point is their sole weakness . What on earth is going on ? Chrissie ? ! Mum ! What are you doing there ? I think I get first dibs on the questions . Alan , what 's going on ? Maria , I 'm going to have to call you back . Sarah Jane 's going to be SO happy . That 's not what 's important . All that matters is saving Mum . I 've got an idea about that . Come on . A role-playing game ? It 's an internet thing . Only some of it 's in the real world , you know , looking for clues , solving puzzles . Like a treasure hunt ? Like when we were dating ? Running round back lanes and plodding across fields looking for a golden rabbit ? That 's right . I don 't believe you , Alan . I know when you 're lying . I 've always known . Maria 's in danger , isn 't she ? And it 's got something to do with Calamity Jane . Sarah Jane . She fights aliens , Maria helps her . Aliens ? They exist , Chrissie . I 've seen them . What do you think nearly brought the moon crashing down ? Aliens ? From space ? Believe me . I do . Your mouth didn 't twitch . What ? The corner of your mouth - it always twitched when you told a fib . It didn 't move at all . Come on ! We 've got to help our daughter ! Whoah ! This is your great idea ? The Sontaran 's space ship ? Kaagh said he had a laboratory . If Luke can synthesize a knock-out gas , we can use it on him . Brilliant ! The programme is enabled , Commander . The dish will align on schedule and the up-link will begin . Good . In 25 minutes , the 10th Fleet shall be avenged . My name shall be purged of shame . I shall return to Sontar as Kaagh the Avenger ! We don 't know what any of these chemicals are . They 're alien . Dylixium chloride , Korazic acid , Lyzirium phosphate ... Chemistry lessons with Mr Smith are much more fun than at school . SIREN WAILS What 's that ? I think we tripped an alarm system . Intruders on my ship ? The half-forms , like bugs in a battle-trench bunk ! It is time to crush them ! Kaagh will be coming ! Luke , you must get a move on ! I can 't rush this . Where are you going ? If I can spot Kaagh coming , I can buy you more time . Be careful . See you back at the telescope . It 's working ! And now we wait . You know , Luke , I don 't think I 'll ever meet anyone like you again . You won 't need to . You 've got me . My dad 's got a job in America . Are you going with him ? I don 't know . You can 't go , Maria ! I don 't want you to go ! Luke , it 's my dad . But you 've always been here . I know , and ... I 'm going to miss you so much ... and Sarah Jane , and Clyde . But none of that matters if we don 't stop Kaagh . Please , Luke , you have to make this gas . Hey , Bilbo ! Over here . By Sontar , I will crush you with my bare hands , Bite-Size ! ELECTRONIC BEEPING Someone ! Anyone ! Let me in ! Clyde ! Quick ! ARGH ! Yes , I 've got it ! Luke 's working on a knock-out gas . Reckons he can take Kaagh out with it . I 'm not sure we 've got time . I 've watched my dad working . I can try and stop the program . The system 's encrypted , I can 't get into it . Can we sabotage the dish ? The antenna has to be aligned . If it can 't operate , he might as well howl at the moon . There 's an operating system on the other side of the complex . You stay here , see if you can break the code . You miserable organism , you let them escape ! I thought you said they were at a telescope ! The telescope must be near ! 'This is Maria . Try again later . ' Oh , she 's still not answering . Maybe the battery 's dead . Well , where do we go now , Alan ? Maria 's in danger , and I hope I don 't have to remind you whose fault that is . Are you sure this gas is going to work ? I don 't have any Sontaran physiological data . But the anaesthetic would disable a human for two hours . And a Sontaran ? We only need a few minutes . It 's the Sontaran 's drone . Run ! Get down ! Mum ! Quickly ! Maria , you have to go with Clyde . Quickly ! Maria , you have to go with Clyde . He 's going to try to disable the dish . Luke , go with me . We have to try everything we can . This is what drives the dish ? Lucy says there 's a central control system transponder . All we 've got to do is take it out . Doesn 't that sound a bit too easy ? The hard part 's finding it . Any luck with the program ? It 's no good . I can 't do this . Let me . What ? I mean , no disrespect or anything , but you 're just a kid and we 're looking at the end of the world here . No disrespect , Lucy , but you really aren 't much more than a kid , either , and can you see the flaw in Eistein 's Theory of Relativity ? Luke can . And he can save the world . He 's had practice . 15 minutes to go . Why isn 't Kaagh here to see his plan succeed ? It 's got to be around here somewhere . 14 minutes , Clyde ! Let go ! Go , Maria . Find the transponder ! Now ! Get off me ! Is this what you are looking for - female half-form ? Remember the first law of battle . Think like your enemy . The second law of battle . Anticipate them . The operating system remains fully functional . Alan , Alan . This is impossible . Just leave them there . Are you mad ? These are designer shoes ! You want some squirrel moving into the most des res in the forest ? Luke , you 've only got four minutes . The code is a bi-axial algorithm . It 's not Earth mathematics . I 'm having to try progressive cross-referencing number bases . You have to hurry . Six ! That 's it , six ! Sontarans have three fingers on each hand . What ? We use the decimal system . We have ten fingers . That 's it . I 've cracked the code . I 've disabled the program . Move away from the controls ! I 'm sorry . We didn 't do it . The antenna 's still operational . These half-forms might be primitive , but I admire their spirit . I shall remember them honourably on my return to Sontar . Earth will be a worthy sacrifice to the Empire . No , Kaagh . Luke broke the program code . He disabled it . You can 't take control of the satellites . The third law of battle . Always have a Plan B. Activating my sleeper agent . She was one of them all along . And I fancied her ! She was unaware of my control . Another rule of war . Infiltrate deep within your enemy . Then infiltrate deeper still . Lucy , no ! You might give your life , but will you sacrifice this half form ? Do it ! I can 't . It 's me or it 's Earth ! One life is as sacred as an entire planet . When the program reloads , it will automatically transmit to satellites and target your nuclear installations around the world . Sontar - ha ! This isn 't conquest . It 's annihilation . The Earth will be useless to your Empire . I will have wiped the Sontaran defeat from history . My name will live for all eternities to come . My people will scream it as a battle-cry . Now I have to admit , that is kind of cool . You 're killing innocent people . Stop the program . This isn 't battle , it 's murder ! Your planet defied Sontar . That can never be ! We will have victory over all . Nothing will stop us ! Try my size fives , Humpty ! Mum , Mum ! Consider yourselves de-activated ! She 's all right . I would like to know how Chrissie knew where to hit a Sontaran . I suppose it can wait . She 's coming round . Quickly , the knock-out gas . Give it to me ... What for ? If we can get Mum home before she comes round , maybe we can convince her that none of this ever happened . She banged her head . Had a bad dream . Anything . Your mum will have saved the world , she won 't have a clue . Believe me , it 's better this way . We 'd never hear the end of it . Maria ! Go back to sleep , Mum . Dad , Dad , are you all right ? What happened ? Those lights in the sky ! What on earth is that ? ! Don 't worry , Professor . Commander Kaagh has been de-commissioned . Sontar - ha ! Don 't try anything . Your craft 's weapons have been disabled - don 't think about coming back . Defeated by a female and half forms . I will go , Sarah Jane Smith . But I will not forget YOU . Sontarans will yet cry my name in battle ! Well , I think that went as well as could be expected , don 't you ? Now perhaps we should all run ! Do you think that 's the last we 've seen of him ? I hope so . With some people , it really doesn 't matter how far they travel , they never really go away . Mum ! Mum , are you OK ? What happened ? I always said these heels will be the death of you . You tripped , banged your head . I was really worried , Mum . Oh , it 's all right , love . I had such a weird dream , though . I dreamed your dad got a job in America . I did . That is , if I take it . I 'd love to go to America . You can still visit , can 't you ? You try and stop me . They 've got shops the size of aircraft hangars there . Are you sure ? I mean , think about everything you 'd be leaving behind . Dad , you can 't ever leave the universe behind . I have completed a further scan , Sarah Jane . I have detected no Sontaran energy signatures . Maybe Kaagh isn 't coming back after all . Thank you , Mr Smith . Sarah Jane ? So , everything packed ? I just wanted to come and take one last look . And I wanted to say goodbye to Mr Smith . In atomic terms , we all remain connected by the universe , Maria , so I will say " au revoir " . I really don 't know what your father did to him . Will you come and see us ? Please . Of course I will . And Maria , I really am sorry for how I reacted when you told me about America . It doesn 't matter . We were sort of busy . No , I was wrong . You see , well , for the first time , I felt I 'd found a family . And so soon , so suddenly , it felt like I was losing it . Losing the daughter I always wanted . Bye . Bye . Safe landing ! Bye . Come on , come on ! I remember it all , you know . Sorry ? The Sontaran . What really happened with my shoe . Don 't worry , I won 't say anything . They deserve a new start . We all do . Thank you . I 'll miss her . Yeah , me , too . I learned a long time ago that if you 're missing somebody , just ... look up at the night sky . Whoever it is , wherever they are , chances are they 're looking at the stars just like you . Sometimes , for all its size , the universe isn 't such a big place after all . Boy , they have no idea what they 're moving in over the road from . I 'm Rani . My family just moved into Bannerman Road . These kids go missing though , that is weird . And the police just don 't have a clue . Hey ! Welcome to Spellman 's magical museum of the circus .

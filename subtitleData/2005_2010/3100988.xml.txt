 NARRATOR : Previously on Surface , Dr Cirko made an important discovery . Adenine , glycine , kerotine . The origin . I know the origin of the species . But Lee will protect secrecy at any cost . When Nimrod , the creature Miles raised , injured an officer ... WOMAN : He 's got electrical burns over half his body . Animal Control said he was chasing a crocodile . ... Miles broke the law to protect him . phil : Dude , he 's out . Let 's go ! Come back here ! Hey , where 's my car ? Grand theft pizza , dude ! This is a stolen car ! ( SlRENS wailing ) He needs to go back to his people , dude , to the ocean . Come on , Nim . Run ! ( SlRENS wailing ) Go , Nim . RON : Miles ! Miles ! Go . sylvia : Miles ! RON : Miles ! Pursued by Lee , forced into hiding ... JACKSON : Welcome to The Boneyard . ... Rich and Daughtery figured out where the creatures will gather . Same coordinates , same place , every year . Deep in the ocean . rich : Holes are right underneath these storms . Boiler . Can they find a way to get there ? Now Surface continues . RON : Listen , thanks very much for your help . I owe you guys big time . You have no idea how lucky you are . Do you realize what your father had to do to get us in this ... Congratulations , you have a police record . Dad ... Don 't speak , just listen . From now on , this is how it 's gonna work . When your school day ends , your work day begins . Your sister 's gonna drive you from school to community service , and you 're gonna pick up trash or recycle cans or whatever else they ask you to do for 16 hours a week , every week , Saturdays included . Each day you come home , go straight to your room . No internet , no TV , just your books . For how long ? The rest of the school year . That 's , like , seven months . Almost eight . Dad , we were just trying to protect Nim . It just ... It just got a little out of hand . Really ? And at what point was that ? The carjacking ? The police chase ? They were gonna kill him . Oh , Miles , for God 's sake , don 't bring up that animal again . It 's true ! RON : That 's enough ! Do you know how many favors I had to use up to get you out of there ? The gathering will take place on the 23rd , which means we 've got four days to complete the submersible and reach the dive site , which is 300 nautical miles off the coast of Oregon , where we will observe and document the creature in its natural ... Ow ! rich : Hey ! ( rich whistles ) Yeah . I think we 're gonna make it . I really do . I mean , we still gotta ... We gotta top these valves off , and we 've gotta reinforce the eyehooks for the tether . Yeah . And fit the windows and get a hatch , and we gotta sink it and test it . Oh , yeah . Make sure it 's airtight and leak proof so that pressure don 't turn us inside out . Now , where do you want these windows ? We could put one here , on this side , and then the same on the other , and then one in the front . Here ? Yeah . Right . The real question is , where are we gonna get the windows ? Well , you know , I got an idea for that . Yeah ? Oh , no , can ... No , no , no , no ... That 's perfect . No way , no day . Huh ? Now , I know it doesn 't look like much , but my uncle 's already sunk a million and a half into this baby . Ah , come on . He 's got big plans for it . No , you 're not gonna cannibalize his boat . LAURA : Are you kidding me or ... No , definitely not kidding you . Jackson , we 're on the verge of witnessing an actual miracle . I mean , it 's the migration of a brand new species , one that 's never been documented before , and you 're worried about a couple of pieces of glass from a junk boat ? Sorry , I 'm just , you know ... We have to do this . She 's right . Since you put it that way . Very good . I 'll get my torch . You 're pretty handy with that thing . Yeah ? Where I come from metal shop ain 't really an elective . My electives were yachting and women 's studies . Really ? Man , if we 'd met in college , I think I 'd have to kick your ass . You went to college ? 72 hours till D-day , boys . How we doing ? Pressure release hatch . Whoa ! That 's genius . I got more . I got a jigsaw , O2 tanks , and most importantly , The Dead . The Dead ? Uh-uh . Hey , man , all right . Hope for you yet . ( TRUCKlN ' playing ON STEREO ) All right . Time for a test drive . Hundred feet and she is home . You see , I think we can have up to three things on both circuits , you know what I mean ? So a 12 volt lead-acid battery should do it . A car battery ? Yeah , we 'll take a spare , but all we need to power is the hydrophone , the scrubber , and the lights , right ? What 's with the tape ? Oh , it 'll protect the image in case of an electrical surge , should we encounter one . Ha ! May we be so lucky . ( CABLE CLANKlNG ) Hey ! Here . Whoa . Whoa . Oh ... What , is it dragging something ? I don 't know . It could be taking in water . All right , I see it ! rich : Easy ! Easy . All right , to the left a little bit . All right , right there . Hold it , hold it . Go down . Down . Just like the pits at Talladega , huh ? Wait , Rich ... Rich , careful ! ( groaning ) LAURA : Rich , Rich , Rich . Are you okay ? rich : Yeah . Oh , my God . officer : Okay , ladies , I want this truck full ! Let 's hustle it up . Piece of advice . You can fill one bag an hour , you can fill ten . Still only counts as one hour . Nice jumpsuit , man . Matches your eyes . And very cool to adopt a highway like this . Yeah . Maybe he can adopt my room ? Well , maybe you could adopt a personality . ALL : Ooh . Ooh , easy there , tough guy . See , we rebels gotta stick together , man . No , man . I 'm not like you . Never will be . ALL : Ooh . Looks like you missed some , bro . Let 's go , man . ( georgia ON MY mind playing ON STEREO ) Come here . No . Just someone I 'm trying to find . Baby , you know I can 't discuss my work . Hmm . Beautiful , yes , but it 's not a flower . It 's the future . How 's she looking ? Yeah , pretty dry . But I still ... I think we should pull the windows and check the gaskets and see if there 's any moisture there . I don 't know about that . It 's gonna take a while , and I 'm pretty sure that leak came from the hatch . I don 't think we should assume anything . I mean , that hose is like a squirt gun compared to the pressure at 5,000 feet . ( sighing ) Well , we 'll see when we retest . Yeah , I don 't think there 's time for that . Well , then we make time . No , there 's two days left . It 's gonna take us a day to get out to the dive site . Well , it 'll be a grave site if the seal doesn 't hold . Look , I know what the problem was , all right ? I fixed it . Why don 't you grant the death wish on your own time , okay ? Why don 't you worry about driving the boat ? Guys , stop . Rich is right , okay ? I mean , if we miss this chance we might not get another one . Hey , I 've checked and I 've rechecked . We 're good . She 's ready . You willing to bet your life on that ? sylvia : Six months . Isn 't there anything shorter ? RON : Any shorter and they say it might not take . sylvia : " Take , " it sounds like brainwashing . RON : It 's wilderness therapy , and they 've had a lot of success with problem kids . sylvia : Yeah , well , we 've never been apart for more than ten days . Yeah . You 're the one who wanted to send him away . Well , maybe I was wrong . Well , he still doesn 't think he 's done anything wrong . He 's had no remorse . I know . I know . I know . So , we 're agreed on this ? ( sighing ) Yes . Is that for luck ? Yeah , it 's George 's number . He played a little , a little Triple-A ball out of school . Until he tore his rotator cuff and ... Yeah . Little Heat . What ? That 's what we called him . He 's ... He 's a pitcher , so ... " Little Heat " ? Mmm-hmm . Well , Lil ' Heat . So , you 're gonna do it . Hmm ? You 're gonna put your life on this thing ? I gotta . For George . Rich . Hmm ? Are you still seeing those holes ? So clear I could jump in them . No champagne , but I found rum or rum . ( LAURA chuckling ) Hmm . Would you do the honors ? Oh ... You . ( rich clicking his TONGUE ) Oh , um , yeah . Hey , wait , wait , wait . She needs a name . Ah . Oh , okay . I christen thee , Lil ' Heat . Okay . Morning , sunshine . You can 't send him away . What ? You can 't send Miles to that camp . That 's not your business . We think it 's gonna help him , Savannah . So what ? He screwed up . He 's a kid . That 's what we do . Your mother and I ... This was a very hard have thought long and hard about this . ... decision . You can 't really ... Yeah , but you don 't know . Know what ? Forget it . sylvia : Savannah . I had a small , very small party while you guys were in Mexico . That 's when I found out that Miles was keeping that whatever it is . What ? You 've known about it the whole time ? And you didn 't say anything . No . It gave me leverage . Oh , Savannah . I saw him with that thing , you know , and he was different . Not the usual apathetic , " I 'm so bored " Miles . This Miles was interested . Like I 've never seen him before in his life . He cared . And for that you 're gonna send him away ? Jackson ! It 's not ... I don 't hear anything . It 's a satellite phone . Give it a sec . It 'll work . All right . Hold up , hold up . All right , we 're good . All right , it 's good . ( PHONE ringing ) Hello . LAURA : Sean , hi . Hey . It 's me . Everything okay ? It 's fine . I 'm going out tomorrow , and I just wanted to let you know . Where ? It 's a couple hundred miles off the coast of Oregon . I 'll be back on Wednesday , and I 'll call you then . If you don 't hear from me then ... Yeah , I 've got the Coast Guard 's number on the fridge . Um , is Jesse there ? Yeah , sure . Jess , it 's your mom ! Hey , Mom , where are you ? LAURA : Hi , peanut ! Um , I 'm ... Yeah , I 'm a little far away . Are you still looking for it ? Yeah , I 'm still looking for it . Um ... I ... I just wanted to call you and tell you that I love you , in case that you forgot . I 'll never forget . ( DOORBELL ringing OVER PHONE ) JESSE : There 's someone at the door . Okay , then go to the door . Okay . Bye-bye , Mom . Okay , bye . Dad , who is it ? Hello , Jesse . We want to talk to Dr. Daughtery regarding two deaths , both of which have been ruled a homicide . Aren 't these federal credentials you have here ? The victims were Pentagon employees . And she 's a suspect or ... She was present at one of the crime scenes . When ? Five nights ago . That 's ... That 's when she came by . She dropped Jesse off . You know where she may have gone ? No . Say when she 'd be back ? No , she didn 't . She 's been acting very strange but ... Has she called ? Tried to contact you in any way ? No . You know , I can subpoena your phone records , and perjury is a crime . Okay . She hasn 't called . ( NlM whining ) ( GLASS clinking ) ( GROWLlNG ) Nim . Got some weather . Storm coming or ... Can 't say . Can I see ? There 's no storm clouds . ( THUNDER rumbling ) Hey , what 's this ? Made some adjustments last night . Couldn 't sleep . Are these bang sticks ? Yeah , for protection . Forty-four caliber heads . You know , I don 't want to hurt them . And I don 't want you eaten by them . Okay , delicate balance . Emergency lifeboat . Compressor runs off the battery . If you have to surface quickly , you flip the switch inside and then the boat inflates . Thanks , Jackson . Hang on , y 'all . Y 'all come over here for a second . Let me ... Let me say a few words . ( EXHALlNG ) Come on . Well , here we are , Lord . We know you brought us all here for a reason , so we 're ready . We 're willing to go all the way . And we know that whatever 's down there is bigger than us all , so take us on your hand , Lord , and lead us to the truth . And if it ain 't too much to ask , bring us home in one piece . Amen . Amen . Amen . Let 's do it . Good ? Okay . Oh , yeah . Here we go . All leaks and grounds are normal , scrubber 's scrubbing , the O2 bleed is ... One . ... one liter per minute . Copy , all systems sat . Increasing descent to 60 meters per minute . Hey , hey ! Oh , it 's a new pressure seal . Once we get down a few hundred feet , it should lock into place . ( CLANGlNG ) See ? Hatch secure . JACKSON : Okay , copy that . Enjoy the ride . Forgot your lunch . I 'm sensing an ulterior motive . No . I just wanted to come and let you know I told the ' rents about your pet . Shut up . No , really . I did , and , shocker , they believed me . Well , a little too late . You miss it , don 't you ? Look , you don 't have to pretend to give a damn . I 'm not . Really . I just ... I felt bad for you . It was like when Mom made me give up my hamster . They didn 't try to kill your hamster . True , but my hamster never tried killing anyone , either . Why couldn 't they just see what he was ? Ron and Sylvia are never gonna see that . They hate that thing . But , I don 't know , they see what it meant to you . What 's this ? Dad hooked you up . Got you moved into a different community work area . You start today . Entering the photic zone . All conditions sat . JACKSON : Uh , yeah , copy . Same here . Man , I tell you , the clarity on that thing 's incredible , ain 't it ? Yeah , I know . I mean , we 're the only ones talking down here , and sound travels five times faster in water . I wish my girls could see this . Here come the fireworks . Oh , my God . LAURA : It 's amazing , right ? Humans are two-thirds water , just like the Earth . The percentage of salt in our blood is the same percentage of salt in the ocean . We are tied to the sea . Yeah , maybe we are . It 's like coming home . WOMAN : ( OVER P.A. ) This week , the aquarium ... You 'll clean the leavings from the touch tank . Leavings ? Well , fecal matter , mostly . But kids lose stuff in there , too . Gum , toys , occasionally their lunch . We pump in 2,000 gallons of fresh seawater per minute . Filters have to be checked every day , make sure no one 's stuck in there . After cleaning , you move on to feeding . This is the food prep area . The locals eat 300 pounds per day . What 's she doing ? Making sushi for the invertebrates . They love this stuff . Mmm . Ew ! You wanna feed the rays ? Sure . JARED : Southern stingrays , relative of the shark . Can smell food in the water from a mile away . Hey . They don 't get live fish ? The mackerel 's fortified with vitamins . It 's better for them . Now , don 't just drop it in . Yeah , I know . You gotta wiggle it around . They key off movement . That 's right . Pretty amazing creatures , huh ? I guess . I mean , something no one 's ever seen before , that 's , that 's amazing , right ? Okay , depth at 1,700 feet . Interior temperature is 75 degrees Fahrenheit and the exterior temperature is 65 degrees . Jackson , can you ping the bottom for me ? Check that . ( SONAR BEEPlNG ) Just about 4,300 feet . Ten , 15 minutes and you 're there . Copy that . We 're getting close . ( WATER dripping ) ( CREAKlNG ) LAURA : Crap . What ? It 's probably just condensation or not . It turns out that leak was not the hatch . Don 't tell me . Don 't tell me that . LAURA : The window . Jackson , what are you doing ? The deeper you get , the longer it 's gonna take me to get you back up . We can repair and relaunch . ( stuttering ) No . No , no , no , no , no . Negative . We are not stopping . Hang on , hang on , hang on . We have to ! You 're taking on water . The weather 's getting nasty . If I leave you down any longer ... Negative , Jackson . We 're not stopping . ( SHUSHlNG ) ( BELLOWlNG ) JACKSON : I have to bring you guys up right now . You don 't understand . You haven 't seen the weather up here . Plus , you do not want to mess around at this depth , trust me . Do you read me ? Rich , Daughtery , respond ! If you guys don 't come back , I have to bring you up . Are you listening to me ? Respond . Daughtery , do you read me ? We 're good , brother . We 've made our decision . Cut us loose . I 'm gonna regret this . You kind of dig this stuff , don 't you ? Yeah . Come on . I wanna show you something cool . I 've been working here for almost six years , so I pretty much have the keys to lock up the place . What are these ? Quarantine tanks . It 's where we try and breed various species , or where we put the animals the locals bring us . That happen a lot ? Oh , yeah . Sea turtles , sharks , everything . Like this . A woman brought in these a couple of days ago . JARED : They 're infertile . I mean , can you imagine what must have come out of this thing ? Uh ... Yeah . How 's that leak ? Same . Golly , it is like a sauna in here , man . Yeah . What is going on ? I thought it was supposed to be cooler . Well , it should be . Jackson , do you have any of Cirko 's thermographic scans up there ? Yeah , affirmative . What do you need ? LAURA : Can you check and see if there 's any hydrothermal vents or smokers or anything ? Negative . The heat 's gotta be coming from somewhere . Hey , there ! Yeah , slow the line , Jackson . Slow the line . Okay , copy . Wow ! Okay , yeah . That 's good . This is a whole lot bigger than the ones at the San Juan de Fuca plate . Cirko , what were you on to ? ( HlGH-PlTCHED screeching ) ( gasping ) Five times faster , huh ? So how close was that ? I gotta get my camera . I gotta get my camera . Right there , see ? Southeast . There 's , um , there 's , like , eight or nine of them . You better double that . ( SCREECHlNG ) This is Dr. Laura Daughtery and Rich Connelly , four thousand feet below the surface amidst a pod of the new vertebrates . Their ... Their lengths range from 100 feet to 175 . What are they doing ? I think they 're breeding . WOMAN : ( OVER P.A. ) ... is a wonderful place for your kids to get close up to any of our marine friends . The sand tiger shark , the lined seahorse , Atlantic stingray , and horseshoe crab are just a few of the many ... Hey . I thought mom was picking me up . I was in the neighborhood . How is it here ? It 's good . Better than picking up trash . Learn anything ? Yeah . Did you know that we 've identified less than 10 % of the species in the ocean ? A lot we don 't understand , huh ? Yeah . That 's true . Hey . I 've seen that before . What ? This ... That hole and that light . ( SCREECHlNG ) This is it . ( BELLOWlNG ) ( electrical crackling ) What the hell ? ( BELLOWlNG ) Oh , my God . Whoa ! Hold on , Jackson ! Slow us down , please ! We 're dropping fast . Jackson , do you copy ? We are falling way too fast ! You gotta pull us back up . You gotta stop us ! ( GRUNTlNG ) ( LAURA screaming ) Whoa ! Oh , my God . You all right ? Yeah , I 'm okay . Rich , don 't move . ( CREAKlNG ) Jackson ? Do you hear me , Jackson ? ( CLANKlNG ) Hang on , hang on . Wait , wait , wait . What 's that ? What is it ? What is it ? What is that ? Uh-oh . The cable snapped . We have to get the raft . We have to get the raft . Folding ... We have to make this work . The cable snapped . The weight 's gonna pull ... Okay . Thank God you 're okay . Let me get the battery going . Okay . The battery is fried . So we 'll get the reserve going here . ( LAURA GRUNTlNG ) Okay . Are you gonna help me with this ? Okay . Uh-oh . What ? Oh , God . This is all part of it . Okay ? Part of what ? This is part of what 's supposed to happen . There are 3,000 feet of cable out there , nearly two tons . Don 't you ... It 's not an accident . ( stammering ) You ... Yeah , but we have to inflate . We 've got to inflate ... It 's okay . It 's okay . Oh , my God . It 's okay . What are you doing ? It 's gonna pull us down . I know . Oh , no . ( LAURA sobbing )

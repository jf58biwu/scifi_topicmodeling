 T - minus 120 to burn . M.S.B. Is go . Hydrogen , go . Deuterium sequences starting . Stabilizers set to 1-4-0 . Positioning thrusters are at 7-niner-7 . Fuel generators are engaged . Oh , my God . She 's out . Ted , I got Zoe out and in the airlock . She 's in Airlock 4 . Do you copy ? Somebody get down here . Stop her . Zoe ? Zoe ! - Hey . - Please . L - No , no , no . Go ahead . You look like you have a need . Okay . Guten Morgen . - Hey . - Briefing in 20 minutes . All right . So glad that you have joined us . - Mmm ! - All right . You 're supposed to be wearing your HALO . I 'm wearing mine . Mission Control says that comm channels 30 through 45 are glitchy . - I 'll look at the transmitter . - Thank you . And - Sorry ! Sorry . Thanks forjoining us , Zoe . Now I know I may be the new guy ... but I 'd like for the daily brief and the Form 24 rundown to start at 0700 . My mother called . Won 't happen again . Has anyone noticed comm 45 is glitchy ? Yeah . I 'm already on it . - What ? - Zoe . You 'll be assisting Jen with her NatSel " A " in the science lab . Then you 're gonna join Paula , Donner and Mintz for the Venus suit checkout . - Wassenfelder , says you 're looking for DUNNOS . - " Dunnos ' " ? " Dark , Unknown , Non-reflective , Non-detectable Objects Somewhere . " - In other words , dark matter . - In other words , nothing . If nothing 's 90 % of the universe , then nothing . All right , guys . Look . I know Donner and I coming on board last minute is ... a little awkward . - Not for me . - Well , it is for most of us . This is a huge , unexpected adjustment for all of us . So please bear with us . We have a lot of catching up to do . Any questions , comments , concerns ? Carry on . You guys mind if we just take a minute here ? I think it 's important to remember where we are . You would think that there 'd be a sadness ... when you start to pull away from Earth - an ache for the mountains and what 's left of the beaches ... for the sweet smell of fresh air . I guess there 's a little bit of that . But when you 're an astronaut , you start asking yourself questions like ... " How the hell did I get here ? " Was it hard work ? Fate ? Was it the hand of God ? ' " You ask yourself , " Why am I one of the lucky suckers leaving ... not one of the poor bastards being left behind ? ' " - I think the obvious question is simply , what the hell happened ? And the obvious answer is that we don 't really know . One minute we 're on the mission , the next minute we 're off . You had no warnings ? No previous conditions ? Well , Ajay and Rollie had small irregularities ... that became exacerbated on the , uh , launch and trip up to the ship . If this had been a shorter mission , they 'd still be up there . But the fact is this is a six-year flight through the solar system . This was an extremely difficult decision . And one that 's been extraordinarily hard on the astronauts and their families . Please respect that . So will you two be joining the team on the floor now ? We certainly hope so . After a little R Rand , uh , life adjustment . Thank you very much . Thank you . - Sorry , Ajay . - As am I , Arnel . Those are the breaks , huh ? I guess my place is here now . Hola , estudiantes . Bienvenidos a Antares . And a very special welcome to the fifth graders at Lincoln Elementary in Findlay , Ohio . I am Paula Morales , the mission 's payload specialist . And this - this is day three of our amazing mission through the solar system . We 're all just starting to settle into our routines ... and starting our science work . - Isn 't that right , Jen ? - Yeah , yeah . That 's right , Paula . - This is our mission biologist , Jen Crane . - Hi , Rollie . Hey , baby . And this is our mission geologist Zoe Barnes . Today , Jen is starting a mission-long experiment in natural selection . Can you tell us what that is , Jen ? What we 're doing is we 're studying ... the differences in rabbit sperm and egg selection ... in a weightless environment as opposed to a weighted one . Does that mean you actually make bunnies ? No . We harvest the D.N.A. From the fertilized embryos . And then we destroy them . And then we start all over again ... using that new D.N.A. To fertilize new embryos . It 's pretty much as close as we 're gonna get to sex in space . I mean , look . See that ? I mean , look at that determination . I had a boyfriend like that once . And I am telling you , booty call . Hmm . Today , we 'll be testing your basic swim skills . Those of you who don 't have any will be packing your bags tonight . This is a pass / fail situation . We 're gonna start you guys off treading water . Sound simple ? Twenty minutes , no hands . When you 're finished , you 'll pull yourself into a life raft , unaided . It 's your body . It 's your life . And I 'm not gonna tell you what to do with it . Good . Thank you . It 's just the sooner you abort , the better you 'll feel physically and mentally . Yeah . I 'm thinking about it . We don 't want to do that if you can 't swim . Seriously , this is the end of the line for me . Negativity prepares the mind for losing . You 're not a loser . - I 'm not a swimmer , dude . - Why ? Because we start off with - I feel like I 'm gonna puke . All right ? We do that with scuba gear to take advantage of neutral buoyancy . So once you pass this test - Wow . Anything that big 's still gotta hurt . How do you think he got it ? That 's a war injury . Whatever happened to him , he 's lucky he survived . - You should ask him . - No . You ask him . Scars like that come with scars . There 's nothing to think about . I mean , is this guy worthy of your gene pool ? You see ? If you can 't answer that one quickly , then you should just forget about it . I mean , I don 't understand why you 're protecting mystery man anyway . If he 's telling you he had a vasectomy , then he 's telling other women the same thing . - And he should be outed immediately . - Questions ? Group one , you 're in the pool in two minutes . - Whoa , whoa , what group are we ? - Three . Three ? That 's my least favorite number . You 're going to be fine , Wass . Come on . " You 're going to be fine , Wass . Come on . " - The miracle oflife . - Hmm . Space babies . Rollie and I always joked they were gonna be our kids . But you destroy them to harvest their D.N.A. Yeah . When they 're 10-cell embryos , Paula . That 's the experiment . Still , in a way , you 're killing your children . - Little Miss Sunshine . - Zoe ? We 're heading back to the airlock to power up the Venus suit . - We 'll need you in about 20 minutes . - Copy that . Excellent . I 'll come with you and make sure the cameras are set up . You happy to see him ? Nadia 's happy to see him . That is all about knocking boots and you know it . I really don 't care . I really don 't . Still , you have to admit , it 's - it 's weird having Donner and Ted up here , isn 't it ? Can 't even begin to tell ya . Okay , Ajay . Take a deep breath . We 're gonna hold off on any cardio procedures and put you guys on thinners . Maybe the plaque will dissolve on its own . How soon can I get back on the floor ? Mike wants you as CAPCOM as soon as you feel you 're ready . I 'm ready now . And I 'm gonna need you to help briefTed . Yeah . Of course . This can 't be easy for you either . It isn 't easy for any of us . Why do you think it waited so long to reject us ? It 's as big a mystery as the day we found it . All we can do is follow its lead . And Ajay ? Will he be coming back on the floor ? Goss wants to do a thorough psych eval . And if he passes ? He won 't pass , Rollie . Barnes , you coming down ? The suit is up and waiting for you . I 'll be right in . " If only I could ... fly . " - " People I know " - - " Aren 't strangers " ? " Where I live is " - In a house . Now there 's a woman who needs some love . Oh . You mean the blonde with the glasses at the bar . Uh-huh . Thinking she gets the nod . Ah , I 'm pretty sure I 've seen her at the training center . That puts her off-limits to you . No , she 's not off-limits unless she 's a candidate . That 's her fourth drink . She 's drinking alone . So something tells me she screwed the pooch . Did you just say " screwed the poop ' " ? Pooch . I said pooch . - Oh , oh , oh , oh . - There she goes . - Gentlemen . - Be careful . - Better hurry . - She may bite . She looks a little green . Excuse me . Do you have a - Thank you . I 'm a little emotional . I 'm just , uh - I - You want to know what I did today ? I mean , do you want to know what is wrong with me ? Do you want to know ? I just spent my whole frigging life ... working my ass off . I mean , dreaming about this one chance . This one frigging chance , and I - I blew it ! Hi , Mom . No . It 's cold up here . L - I had the sniffles . Who ? No . I haven 't called him yet . I haven 't had the time , Mother . Do you even remember why I came up here ? It was not to meet your podiatrist 's nephew . Well , I don 't care if he 's a Scorpio , Mother . Cancer women have got to be compatible with some other sign . And I am not - No , I am not interested in a relationship right now . I rep - How many times do I have to say - You know what , Mom ? I am , uh - I 'm gonna go . I am done with this . So say " I love you . " I love you too . Bye . You know , they 've been making these things for 200 years . You 'd think they 'd come up with something better than these buttons . Think you can get ' em with zippers . And this is the ladies ' room . Could 've fooled me with that language . You kiss your mother with that mouth ? - That 's friggin ' shocking . - All right . You 're mocking me . Well , screw you , Maddux . Donner . You 're Maddux Donner . Is that a good thing or a bad thing ? Bad being - A sorry excuse for a guy , who left two people on Mars ... or the good 's the tragic American hero you wanna take home and comfort . - That is pathetic . - You 're not gonna pee ? Four beers goes right through me . But you can 't just have the big bladders . Are you stalking me ? Well , I probably could 've taken a pee in the men 's room . Get out ! I 'll be at the bar . Ow , ow , ow . Astronauts don 't say " ow . " Well , apparently they do now , Donner . I just did . I 'm in . Control , Zoe 's in . Roger that , Donner . Lock and load . - Is that you , Rollie ? - Just came on shift . Ajay back on too ? Negative , Maddux . He 's got some further tests he needs to go through . He 'll be out here soon . Well , everybody up here thinks we 're making piss-poor replacements . Well , you let us be thejudge of that . - Helmet on ? - Roger that . Escúchenme bien , estudiantes . The Venus suit was delivered to Antares over six months ago . This is Zoe 's chance to check out all of the critical operating systems . The motors to help her move , the life-support system ... and most importantly - To check for any tiny leaks that may have developed in the seals . We do this now so if anything is wrong , we have time to fix it . ¿ Comprenden ? - Suit 's secure ! - Suit is secure . - We are go for pressure . Zoe ? - I 'm set for a normal air mixture . Copy that . - Everything 's go for power up . - Executing power up . Dr. Mintz , can you tell us ... why Zoe needs this much protection on Venus ? Well , the surface temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit ... and the air pressure is that of 90 earth atmospheres . So , even a tiny micro-leak in the suit could be catastrophic . Can you tell us how you 'll check for leaks ? Zoe 's suit 's gonna be pressurized to five atmospheres . We 're gonna drop the airlock pressure to that of a vacuum . And if there 's any breach at all , her pressure will fall . - Hey , lover . - Hey . We miss you ... a lot . Roy made you a bowl of cereal this morning . He forgot you were gone . How you holding up ? Guess I 'm still in shock . It 's a lot to take in in a few days . Rollie will help you get through it . Then you 'll have to help the crew when you get to Venus . It won 't be easy . Why did it do this , Eve ? You 're the expert . Why did it wait till the last minute ? Rollie was asking the same question . Because it doesn 't make sense . We know so little about Beta , about what it ultimately wants . But apparently , it 's picked you and Donner . For what ? And why are we any better than Ajay and Rollie ? - I don 't know . - Well , what do you know , Eve ? What do you guys know ? - This is a huge mission . - It knows . Beta knows . That 's the leap of faith here . We need you to visit pod 4 , honey . It chose you . Maybe it 'll give you an answer . If you 're the active CAPCOM , then what are you doing talking to me ? Well , Arnel and Donner are running suit check with Zoe ... so I thought I 'd grab a little sugar with my baby . I still can 't believe you 're not up here with me . Ajay says it has to do with our true path in life . - There was nothing we could do . - Yeah , but they drag you all the way back there ... - and they don 't do a cardio procedure ? - They have us on thinners . Think the plaque might dissolve all on its own . I 'm making our babies . I caught a little bit of Paula 's show this morning . She 's explaining the Venus suit right now . She ragged on me for having to kill the embryos . Um , an obnoxious way to put it , but she 's entitled to her views . Yeah . As am I. And you have plenty . Which is why I love you . You know I want babies with you , don 't you , Rol ? I know , baby . Plenty of time for that when you get back . Yeah . Yeah . Couldn 't you do that on Earth ? That whatever it is you are doing ? The short answer is yes . So why do they bother launching your fat ass up here to do it ? This conversation was old when you had your boobs done . You are avoiding an answer . You don 't think I ask myself that question every day ? Seriously , I never should 've made it through the program . I know that . But put yourself in my shoes . If they offered you this , would you ever turn it down ? Look at Nadia Schilling . - Her elbows are out of the water . - And so are her breasts . She 's flashing the A.I. ' s . She really think that 'll help her get a better mark ? I hate men . Group one , into the raft . - Group two , into the pool . - Let 's go . Come on . Let 's go ! - This is so stupid . - What ? - I 'm not even gonna make it that far . What 's the point ? - The point is that you tried . You 've made it this far , Wass . Who 's to say you 're not meant to go the whole way ? - Me . I 'm saying it . - It is never your own choice . You painted your face and went on an unauthorized E. V.A. Is that rational behavior for an astronaut ? I understand completely what I did was a highly emotional , self-destructive response . When you feel like your destiny has been ripped from your body ... you are without a rudder in a fierce wind ... completely overtaken by the emotion ... of that moment . How is he ? Sane and moving . For this , I truly apologize . But that won 't get him anywhere , will it ? Left arm forward . Nominal . - Arm bend . - Nominal . Twist on diagonal . Nominal . Full range of motion , though I feel like the Michelin Man . Yeah , well , there 's always been an uncanny resemblance . Hey . That 's it for the test control . We are nominal on all . We copy that . Zoe , can you give me a pressure reading off your heads-up ? Just over 73 p. s.i. Five atmospheres . Perfect . So while we got you out here ... let 's see what happens in a vacuum . Copy that . I 'm gonna try to turn around here . Something wrong , Zoe ? - Did you hear that ? - Hear what ? On the comm ? Are those glitches still there ? Yeah . Just a little feedback on the comm . You okay ? Nominal , Donner . I 'm perfect . Uh , Rollie , just give me a second here before you secure . Copy that . A tether is not required , Donner . Outside hatch is not opening . Well , interlocks make me nervous lately . Let 's just leave it at that . All right , Paula . Let 's clear . Pod 4 engaged . Zoe , please don 't . Flight , we have a breach . - Open hatch ! - Donner ? Zoe ! Pressure blew her out . Ted , we got a problem . Hatch failed . Zoe 's out . Repeat . Zoe is out . - What the hell 's happening ? - Exterior airlock hatch opened . - Zoe 's out . - She had to hit the hatch pad . We didn 't do it here . Thank God she 's tethered . Ow . Zoe , you okay ? The suit 's operating ? Little shaken up , but everything looks nominal . What the hell happened ? - I don 't know . Did you hit the hatch pad ? - I did not hit the hatch pad . Well , I 'm just asking . Well , you don 't need to ask because I did not pull the friggin ' eject lever . Fine . Can you get hold of anything ? Not a chance . I feel like a fishing lure . Well , sit tight . I 'm gonna reel you in . - Ten bucks . - Ten bucks for what ? - Ten bucks there 's a no-go . - A no-go ? - He goes home alone . - Okay , here she comes . - Can you run my debit , please ? - He took care of it . Tell him thank you and , uh , to go screw himself . My man ! You 're losing your touch ! Yeah . It certainly looks that way , doesn 't it ? Damn . No , no . Don 't give up . I think she likes you . Crap . Crap . Might have better luck without the sunglasses . Of course , if you 're looking for this , you left it with the bartender . I think it was on purpose . - Did you bring any - - What ? - Do you have any - - I 've had a vasectomy . - Is he in the program ? - Why would I tell you if he was in the program ? - Okay , so he 's in the program . - What ? It 's an easy denial , Zoe . " Is he in the program ? " " No . " You equivocated . Okay . So which one of these schmucks is dumb enough to tell you he had a vasectomy ? - Group two , into the raft ! Group three , into the pool ! Oh , God . - Is it an instructor ? - What ? Please stop . Will you please just stop . You 're never gonna find out 'cause I 'm never gonna tell you . - Tell her what ? - Nothing . Wass , let 's go ! Wass ? Wass ! - Did you guys see him ? - No . - Wass ? - Come on , Wass . Stop goofing around . Let 's go . - Come on up out of the water . - Where did Wass go ? - Uh , Control ? - We 're here , Zoe . Just talking about your suit . That 's good , because my heads-up says I 'm losing pressure . - You hear that , Flight ? We have a leak . - Copy that . It 's built like a tank . It should hold . - Donner ? - Zoe , can you give me some numbers ? I 'm at 65 p. s.i. 64.7 , 64.3 . We could go to the O.P.S. The concern down here is that introducing more pressure may cause the leak to open further . Guys , I am coming with you to Venus . We need to get you back inside as fast as we can . We 're gonna have to depressurize this compartment so he can get out . Let 's clear the bay . Move it , guys . - She 's gonna be okay , isn 't she , Donner ? - Yeah . Yeah . She 's gonna be fine . Get out of the way ! What the hell were you doing ? I was a lifeguard , you idiot . Haven 't you ever heard of passive rescue ? - What ? - Clearly you have not . Passive rescue is not struggling with the drowning victim - rather allowing him to pull you down . When the victim tires , he starts to drown . He becomes weak enough for you to gain control and pull him to the surface . I was doing what I was trained to do . What the hell were you doing ? I was trying to help you . Well , then be a gentleman and help me pull him out of the water . My friggin 'pleasure . What ? Canis Major . Finding constellations at 2 : 00 in the morning with a buzz on is fun . Not so much at 7 : 00 with a hangover . Yeah . I 'm stretching it anyway . - My Murzim 's a little far from my Sirius . - Yeah . - I was gonna mention that . - I didn 't hear you complaining . - Oh , no . - What 's the matter ? - The test . - Oh , come on . Stop with the tests . That 's easy for you to say . You 've been to Mars . It 's a psych eval . There 's no right or wrong answer . Unless you saw the black splotches as being severed body parts , you 're fine . My answers to the Rotter incomplete sentence blanks went something like ... " If only I could ... fly . " - Okay . - " People I know ... aren 't strangers . " " Where I live is ... in a house ! " - That 's what you said ? - Yeah . All right . Those are perfectly fine answers . Maybe if I was applying to space preschool . Yeah , could I have been a little bit more stupid ? Well , uh , let me tell you , actually . You know , a couple years back , we had this candidate by the name of Rogers , okay ? I took this guy up in the trainer . And he 's puking the whole time . All right ? So we-we set her back down again . And he 's so desperate to get out that he thinks the eject lever is the canopy . - He did not . - 500 feet straight up . 500 feet down . Bam . Chute didn 't have time to open . That 's terrible . - Yeah . But it 's more stupid than you . - He died . - Yeah , but it was funny . - Donner ! This is personal , don 't you get it ? That guy is me . I am clueless dead guy ! I just pulled the eject lever . Closest I 'm gonna get to the space program was last night , here , screwing you . - Oh . So that 's why you did it ? - Did what ? Screwed me last night . Get your little piece of the space program ? I 'm sorry . Wasn 't that part of your pickup line ? Yeah . For civilians . You know , I thought you were a civilian . I don 't screw astronauts . [ Water Shuts Off Then why 'd you sleep with me ? I don 't know . Drunk . Wrong . So wrong . - I got you ! - What do you mean , " you got me " ? - You knew . Even when I told you why I was here , you knew ! - What did I know ? - You knew that I would never make it into the program ! Zoe Barnes ! Hi . Yes . Uh , right . Well , yes , I am flying out this morning . That 's very nice of you to say . Thank you . Yes . Thank you very much for calling . That was the agency administrator . Hey , I 'm sorry . Look , they - There 's something like a thousand applicants for every person that makes it . - It 's really brutal . - Just ... kiss me . Okay ? You want to roll it one more time before your flight ? - I don 't screw astronauts , Donner . - Huh ? I just got in . Whoo-hoo ! Whoo-hoo ! Are you there , Donner ? I 'm here , Zoe . Mission Control , I 'm in the airlock . - Hatch is secure . - We copy that . Ted , you guys wanna get back in the corridor , you can repressurize now . - Copy that . - How 's your pressure , Zoe ? I 'm at 24 . 23.9 . Guess what . I am looking at Canis Major . I can see it . That would be a perfect ... Murzim-Sirius arrangement , I think . - Yes , it would . - Much better than yours . Although yours is pretty good . Okay , I 'm gonna start pulling you back in now . Sure as hell beats ceiling sparklies . Whee ! She 's gone from five to two atmospheres in less than 10 minutes . Her speech is starting to slur . - Nitrogen narcosis ? - Yes . It 's time to start worrying about the bends . Donner , switch to private comm 2 . She 's getting a little loopy , isn 't she ? We have her on a normal air mixture for these tests . She 's getting a nitrogen buildup in her blood like she 's on a 50-meter scuba dive . Well , I can handle a drunk . With the depressurization , Claire 's worried she might be getting the bends . I 'll set up the hyperbaric chamber . Can 't you guys give her a pressure boost ? Negative , Donner . That micro-leak we have is getting bigger by the minute . Telling me to pick up the pace a little bit , aren 't you ? I 'm telling you if you want that fish to be alive when you reel it in ... - you pick up your pace a lot . - Roger that . Do you feel like we 've been here , Donner ? I feel like we 've been here ... many , many times before , you and me . Zoe , you should really conserve your air now . Is that a euphemism for " shut up " ? I need you to conserve your air , Zoe . I did not pull the eject lever . I know you didn 't . Stop talking . Oh . It was a euphemism . Euphemism . We get her out of the suit as fast as we can , then we get her into the chamber . Get off your ass and do something ! What ? Tell me what to do and I 'll do it . She 's down to about 10 p. s.i. Her interior suit will keep her pressure up ... but she 's only got three minutes of air . That 's not enough time to get her in . Floor 's open . Ideas , people ? She 'll have roughly five minutes after losing consciousness before sustaining brain damage . Might be enough time . What about-What about spit , Arnel ? - Is that you , Wass ? - Yeah , yeah . Can she spit ? A thick one might slow a micro-leak considerably at that pressure . And it would - it would find the hole on its own . Couldn 't hurt . - Anything 's worth a shot . - You get that , Donner ? Copy on the loogie . Zoe , you think you can spit for me ? - Spit ? - Yeah , spit . Hock a loogie , big one , right down in your suit . Are you making fun of me ? No , I 'm not . I 'm serious . I need you to hock a big one . Rollie , is he making fun of me ? - Zoe , do it . - How big ? Big as you can . Right now , do it . Come on , right now . Ew . Come on . It 's slowing . Slowing . Holding at 7 . Oh , my gosh . Wow . Very impressive , Steven , but truly disgusting . Oh , thank you ! That was great . There is a reason he 's on this mission . Donner , get her back inside before she gets the bends . Roger that . I was a pretty decent athlete as a kid . Hoops , soccer , baseball . When it came to choosing up sides , I was almost always picked first . That leads to a certain arrogance . It 's an expectation . You perform well , you win . It 's cause and effect . I always knew you 'd be here . It doesn 't always prepare you well for being an adult . Schilling ? Stellar , pass . Barnes . Pass . Wassenfelder . We send that boy back tomorrow . I want him passed . He can 't swim . Teach him . Life isn 't always fair . I don 't understand . I 'm part of this team . - I 'm so sorry , Ajay . - Failure can be rewarded . We 'll find something for you in Research . Merit can be looked at like a disease . Sometimes I think the only natural selection happens in a petri dish . But if it 's in a petri dish ... that 's not really natural , is it ? No answers on the hatch blowing . She didn 't do it . Damn lucky we found that leak today and not on Venus . Yeah . Freaky lucky . So the question is , who or what is it ... that 's picking the teams ? And why can the results seem so unfair and so painful ? I have no answers . All I know is if they pick you first ... you better come through . And you never ever , ever pull the damn eject lever . Mmm . Ahh . English - US - SDH

 Previously on Dollhouse ... You tell me that you programmed one of your dolls to be Jack the Ripper ? All I know is Alpha accessed multiple imprints And one of them did this , and slaughtered everyone around your girl before pulling a smoke and mirrors . They won 't wake up ! - I have a message for your from inside the Dollhouse . - It 's not funny . They 've been using this body to spy on you for months . I 'm the only person to know how to find the Dollhouse and you 're the only person who knows how to get in . Where are we ? We 're under the skin of the mighty ... " beast " . You really think you could just walk into the Dollhouse ... when everyone knows it doesn 't exist ? Alpha ! Well , you kept my gift . Turns out different every time . Victor 's , for example . My prince . I told you I 'd come rescue you . Help ! I need help in here ! Victor ... He ... He attacked Victor . Alpha . We need EMT response . Now ! He had a scalpel . He cut ... Exits have been secured . But I think the horse has left the barn . Motorpool 's reporting a dumped van about two blocks from here . Full lockdown . I want a complete head count- - actives and staff . Go and help Victor . Quickly ! He came for Echo . He took her . There was an imprint . I don 't know what . He somehow buried the signature . We can find them both because she 's tagged . Not anymore . Her GPS strip- - dug it out of her , and he went into the system and severed the bio-links . I can 't see her vitals . She 's just ... Gone . I want to know what he 's imprinted her with . - I 'm looking . - Keep looking . He asked me if I always wanted to be a doctor . Well ... Who can fathom the mind of a crazy person ? The one who made him crazy ? Maybe . How do you like your new togs , baby ? Love them . Thank you . Ouch . It still stings . I had to get it out . You trust me , don 't you ? You know I do . Yeah , I do . We 've been through a lot together , haven 't we ? Ever since you took me out of that first place when I was 13 . 13 , already a woman . That 's what you said . I remember . But it never happened . Did you tell her that ? Shut up . Baby ? I didn 't know you when you were 13 . None us did . One of us did . One of us did . I 'm not Bobby . What do you mean you 're not Bobby ? I mean ... I 'm not just Bobby . Bobby ... My Tasty Couture printed T- - she left it out of the bags . You got enough there for now , don 't you ? We can 't go back . You left out my Tasty Couture . I looked really cute in that shirt , too , you stupid bitch . Ms. Alvarez , Mr. Blevins , am I to understand you 've lost both your Actives and our client ? Yes , Ms. DeWitt . Alvarez 's girl is a bad influence on my guy , Ms. DeWitt . I don 't know why we insisted on Parent . There is no " we " in this equation , Mr. Blevins . It is not your concern which Active is selected for which engagement . Your only task is discreetly to observe the proceedings . And we were , but ... it looks Alpha knew he was being followed . I made it very clear these imprints were prone to paranoia . I flagged it in the paperwork . Just as a point of interest , how potentially lethal would you say these imprints are ? Okay , Lars . Who are you working with ? Nobody . I 'm not working with anybody . Who was in the vans ? Vans ? I didn 't see any vans . Did you see vans ? Lars ... It 's sad ... it 's sad how you lie , I can smell it . You think that I have survived this long on the run without being able to tell who 's lying to me ? And who 's not ? You 're hiding something . I can see it in your eyes . No . I will cut it out . Okay , okay , okay , okay . It 's complicated . It 's complicated . Right . Make it simple . You 're , uh ... you 're not real . What ? You and your girlfriend ... What did you say about my girlfriend ? You 're not real ! Either way ... you think you 're on a cross-country crime spree . You 're not . You think you have a doomed love . It 's not doomed . It 's not even love . I ... paid for this . It was supposed to be my fantasy . Look , I just wanted to have a little fun . A little fun ? You wanted to have a little fun ? Well , are you ? Are you having fun , Lars ? No . She 's real . And it 's the last real thing you 're ever going to see . Crystal . Yeah , baby ? I 've got a lock . San Pedro , industrial road 7-18 . We 're close . Whiskey , would you like a treatment ? Yes , please . Alpha . Treatment . Yeah , let 's do that instead . Let 's go to the van , okay ? Thanks for the ride . Where 's Kepler ? Don 't tell me that hypochondriac gave you the slip . Leave us . This man- - the man you brought here tonight- - was , until last year , one of our Actives . Designation Alpha . You 're telling me Kepler 's a Doll ? Not at all . Stephen Kepler- - the real Stephen Kepler- - is a corpse . His body was identified this afternoon by Arizona authorities . And these bodies ... they 're programmed to massacre ! The Alpha situation was an unfortunate technological anomaly . A technological anomaly ? My God . What have you people done ? What have you done ? You have brought this thing back into my house to defile it a second time . And now ... He 's taken Echo . Caroline . Yes , I thought that might wipe the smirk off your face . I 'm walking out of here now . Out of the question . He broke out of here- - Alpha- - and so will I. Alpha 's a genius . None of the follow teams has even left the garage yet . Building 's locked down . Someone called in a terrorist threat . Alpha . He 's laughing at us . I can make this go away . Set up a perimeter . Let me know when it 's time . Ballard ? Brian , thank God it 's you . And not someone who can stand you ? Keep your eyes on me . Nod . They 're watching us . Do you trust him ? I trust that I know what he wants . - Listen , there 's no bomb . - What ? The tip was bogus , but the Dollhouse is real . The Dollhouse ? It 's right under your feet : a self-contained facility built entirely underground . I 've seen it . I can take you there . Everybody , back in the trucks ! False alarm . What are you doing ? What am I doing ? A bogus bomb threat , Ballard ? What , suspension wasn 't enough for you ? You want to go to prison ? Don 't make me change my mind . I ... have news . Have you identified the latent imprints ? Not yet . I was going to inventory all of Echo 's old imprints to see if maybe the signatures matched any residual noise . And anyway ... They 're not there . I beg your pardon . They 're gone . Every wedge . Primary and back up . Every personality we 've ever imprinted on Echo ... they 're gone . Why would he take the wedges ? What good would they be to him ? Welcome to your castle , my princess . Be hold . Your throne . Say , you got a bathroom ? It hurts . I know it does . It won 't always . I 'm not my best anymore . I want to be my best . Yes . I know you do . How can I be my best now ? Dr. Saunders , how can I be my best , please ? You can 't , Victor . You can 't be your best . Your best is past . A past you can 't even remember . You 're ugly now . You 're disgusting . All you can hope for now is pity and for that you 're going to have to look somewhere else . Dr. Saunders . Dr. Saunders . Hello . Whiskey . What do we have here ? She came back from the Miller engagement with some shoulder pain . Have one of these and sit right down here and I 'll see what I can do . You 're overworked , dear . You 're too popular for your own good . I keep recommending a week of rest . Our # 1 Active ? Boss lady will never let her lie fallow . I try to be my best . I 'm sure you do . We have an intake- - all available handlers to the floor . You got this ? Sounds like you 're going to have another friend . Friends are nice . They sure are . Impressive , no ? This is where you 'll spend the majority of your non - engagement time . When does the hankering for tasty brains kick in ? These people are zombies . We call them Actives . You 'll be served five-star cuisine here , and you 'll never want for anything . This isn 't the end of your life . Then why do I feel like I 'm walking to the gallows ? It 's five years , and to you it could feel like an instant . She is sad . Dr. Saunders is nice . So this is it . This is where you steal their souls . Yeah , and then we put ' em in a glass jar with our fireflies . Why is there a tall , morally judgmental man in my imprint room besides him ? Special Agent Ballard is going to lend us his inestimable crime-solving abilities . Say , maybe he can start with finding the guy who Tasered me . Pretty sure he led Alpha right in here . He can help . We all need to work together if there 's any hope of finding and stopping Alpha . You know that better than anyone . You will assist Special Agent Ballard with his profile . All hands on deck . Do I make myself clear ? Good day . We 're ready for our treatments . Who the hell is this ? Couple more decades . I 'll take , uh ... Sierra first . Hello . What is this thing anyway ? And what are we going to do to her ? Everything , nothing- - not to her . She won 't ... be her . We won 't be needing this , will we , honey ? Wendy is going away . She won 't be here in a minute . Wait , what , it 's like a magic trick ? We 're going to make her disappear ? We 're going to stick her in a wedge . We 're going to wedge her . I don 't get it . Of course you don 't . How could you ? The mind you have been given is so tiny , so primitive that it is incredible you can even perform basic motor functions or form words . Screw you , Bobby . Don 't listen to him . You 're perfect . I need you just like this , just like this , not afraid of anything , so we could get out of that place , make it here . And you were great . Jacking that car , getting that girl . You were perfect . I was . You 've always been . Hello , Echo . Hello , Alpha . Good ... day . I 'm going to yoga . I like you . You 're special . I try to be my best . You are the best . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Echo , Topher 'd like to see you for a treatment . I enjoy my treatments . Thank you . Go on ahead . I 'll catch up . What the hell are you doing ? Hell . I don 't understand " hell . " It 's what you would have caught if it had been Dewitt coming around the corner instead of me . You 'd already be on your way to the Attic by now . Just watch your step . I 'll do that . Topher says it 's like childbirth . I think it 's more like watching someone die . Well , someone 's going to die if my partner doesn 't get her ass out here . Trail 's going cold . But you 're not cold . Are you , handsome ? What 's your story ? Wait . Don 't tell me . You got multiple contracts on this job ? That 's okay . I like a little stiff competition . But when it turns out you 're not the one who collects the bounty , promise you 'll hold it against me . So , if you 're done molesting the furniture , can we get these guys ? Well , you 're still in your pajamas . She 's not screaming anymore . she 's screaming . They 're all screaming . Must you always defend ... Why can 't you ever take my side ? I didn 't say nothing . You always say nothing . There she is . Listen . Am I supposed to hear something ? Not yet . Bobby , you 're scaring me . Little lamb ... what have you got to be afraid of ? I 'll tell you what . There 's only one person that can hurt you now , just one ... and that 's what we 're here to take care of . Who was he after the day it happened- - the day of your unfortunate technological anomaly ? He wasn 't after anybody . It was a random killing spree . You 're wrong . Look ... You can 't profile Alpha . He 's not a person . He 's ... He 's like Soylent Green . He 's people . He experienced a composite event- - 48 personalities , not split personalities . Full , total , complete personalities got dumped into his coconut all at once . He snapped . Oh , I believe he snapped . Who did he target ? Who did he go after first ? His handler . Half my staff . Uh , then Dr. Saunders walked in . The woman with the scars ? This is a waste of time . In a mass killing like this , the first victims will often be whoever 's in the way . Who was the first individual that Alpha went for the moment he had a choice ? Himself . The first individual ? He came over here to the self shelf . It 's where I keep my primaries stored . It 's the original personalities that the volunteers first walk in with . He took his original self and he smashed the hell out of it . And you said this time he took all of Caroline 's imprints- - the ones you created ? Yeah . Where 's her original self ? You have a backup , right ? This was the backup . Where 's the original ? Hello , Caroline . Has it been five years ? What is this ? What am I doing sitting here and standing over there ? Baby ... meet yourself . Oh , God , the wrongness of this is so large . Whose body is this ? It 's just a body . They 're all pretty much the same . Well , I think this one wet itself . What did you mean " meet myself " ? This whining , pathetic creature , this self-hating human- - that was you . What ? She 's responsible for all of the terrible things you can 't remember . - My brain hurts . - Your brain hurts ? Thatismy brain . I want my brain back . I want back in my brain . You should have thought of that before you vacated the premises . I don 't even know this girl . Do you know why ? - ' Cause we never met ? - Because she abandoned you . She walked out on you when you needed her most . Time 's got a little tough . The road got a little rocky , seas got a little choppy , and she thought , I 'll go to sleep . " Night-night . See you in five years . " She left you to the jackals , to the wolves . To the predators . Isn 't that right , Caroline ? She said that I would be taken care off , and that I would be safe . Do you feel safe ? Do you ? You feel safe ? Safe , do you feel ? What do you feel ? Confused . I 'm with her . Youareher . But you don 't have to be . You can ascend . You can evolve . It 's in you . I 've seen it . And I can help you , baby , just like I always have . She was never there when you needed her . But I was . I like trees . Someone 's getting a treatment . Whiskey , would you like a treatment ? - Yes , please . - All right . Tidy your station , and then you may go with Sophie , Whiskey . I swear , that girl keeps getting sent out . She 's never gonna finish the tree . And it 's a small tree . That 's my girl . What can I say ? Most requested Doll in the house . - # 1 . - Really ? Whiskey ? Let Echo be # 1 . - How ? How did this happen ? - I don 't know . Uh , some residual memory , inactive neurons from a previous engagement . All I can do is run a full-range diagnostic . I 'm bringing up every last one of his prior builds , see if anything matches . You don 't leave this room until it 's done , and when you 've finished , send him to the Attic . I don 't understand . Was I not my best ? I was making art . Alpha , you need to settle , okay ? You need a treatment . Okay ? A treatment . Please , I ... I need a treatment . That 's good . That 's good . He 's good . He 's down . Thanks . I need a treatment . Yes , you do . You surely do . I enjoy my treatments . Oh , then you 're gonna love this one . It 's kind of a greatest hits . Hey , I need some help . Come here . Come here ! No ! No ! No ! Shut it down ! Shut it down ! I understand hell now . My God , Topher , what the hell 's going on here ? 48 personalities , each with its own rich history , and none of it tells me anything . Who 's Alpha ? Alpha is all of these . That 's what I keep saying . And of course it doesn 't tell youanything . It doesn 't tell meanything , and I 'm smarter than everyone in this room . But less scary . I know you 're all very invested in your vaunted technology , and it is very impressive , but I still don 't believe you can wipe away a person 's soul . Their what ? Their soul . Who they are at their core . I don 't think that goes away . You 'd be wrong about that . I want to know who Alpha was ! Who was he before in private life ? That is not relevant . With all respect , one of Alpha 's first acts after compositing was to destroy his original self . We should know who that was . You ... All right . I still have about 19 personality builds to reassemble so I can try and figure out which of Echo 's imprints Alpha used on her , so ... Oh , good luck with the whole God thing . Do not let him do this to you , please . You don 't even know what it is I 'm doing . It 's not good . I know that . I 've been in that chair . It hurts . Just for a minute . - You won 't remember . - Iremember . It still smells like burnt hair in here . He 's going to make me a superior creature . An ascended being . Do you even know what that means ? - Do you ? - No . So , you 're not better than me . Look where you are . You 're in a lair , okay ? An evil lair . And you 're sitting in some messed-up dentist 's chair letting a guy who talks to himself attach wires to your head , which , incidentally , is my head . Open . Bite down . Good . Go ahead . Keep talking . I want you to . We all do . This is how it shall be . She will ascend . She will know . And then she will kill you . What ? Why ? Because ... that 's what we need . A blood ritual . Yes , yes , we 've got to have one of those . I mean , the Aztecs knew it . The pre-Hellenic Minoans knew it , for God 's sakes . From the moment man first clawed his way out of the primordial ooze a nd kicked off his fins , he 's understood that the gods require blood . New life from death . The ancients had it right . But the old gods are back . Alpha ? Meet Omega . Get out ! Oh , God . Oh , gods . I get it . Now ... I get it . I knew you would . Oh , yeah . Now I understand everything . Carl William Craft . Three names- - always ominous . When the Rossum Corporation first began its investigations into neural science , some of our recruits were furnished by the Department of Corrections . You experimented on prisoners ? We offered the opportunity to trade lengthy prison sentences for five-year terms of service with us . What was he in for ? Kidnapping , attempted murder . Well , he never actually killed anybody yet . Not until he came here . Based on what I 'm reading , this man was well on his way to becoming Ted Bundy . You have no proof of that . The only reason he didn 't kill anybody is because the victim got away . When they finally picked up Craft , they found a whole murder kit in his car . - He was evolving . - So , there 's a living witness . - You want to drive ? - I can do that . We 're confused . Omega , you hit me with a pipe . Call me Omega again , and you 'll get some more . Something must have gone wrong with the composite . Nothing went wrong . Every imprint this Active has ever had is alive and awake in her head right now . Then why did you hit me in the head with a pipe ? It was handy ? And you wanted me to kill myself ? No . I wanted you to killher ! Her is me . You made that very clear . No . Her is the old you . Try and keep up ! I 'm way ahead of you . You think we 're gods ? We 're not just humans anymore . We 're not multiple personalities . We 'remanypersonalities . And one of my personalities happens to be a multiple personality , but that doesn 't make me a multiple personality . I 'm looking for a little nuance here . - We 're not gods . - Fine ! bermensch . Nietzsche predicted our rise . Perfected , objective , something new . Right . New , superior , people with a little German thrown in . What could possibly go wrong ? We 're not new . We 're not anything . We 're not anybody because we 're everybody . I mean , I get it . I understand it . I 'm experiencing , like , 38 of them right now . But I somehow understand that not one of them is me . I can slip into one . Actually , it slips into me . They had to make room for it . They hollowed me out . There is no me . I 'm just ... - a container . - There 's a you . She 's right here . He may be crazy , but he 's right . You walked away from me . You left me alone in that place . Why did you do that ? It 's complicated . Sweetheart , however complicated you thought our life was before , you cannot tell me ... How 's that for a complication ? So , let me ask you something . It 's pretty obvious you 're police . How did you end up working for these people ? Could ask you the same question . I 'm not working for them . I 'm just trying to save the girl . There 's always a girl . 427Anita Walsh . Hello ? Miss Walsh ? Who 's asking ? Special Agent Paul Ballard , FBI . I 'm sorry . I know it 's early , but there 's an urgent situation you may be able to help us with . We got to ask you a few questions . It 's about Carl Craft . I don 't have strangers in my home . Um , I 'm just leaving for work . I 'll come down . You do realize what we 're doing to this woman ? Resurrecting a nightmare . And maybe for no good reason . Whoever Carl Craft was may have nothing to do with who ... Alpha is . Agent Ballard . How may I help you ? You don 't know what you 're doing . - What you 're giving up ! - Right . Why would I want to live in a luxurious spa-like environment when I could live here with you ? I thought you were different ! I thought you were exceptional . I was wrong . You 're weak . I may not know who I am , but at least I know who I 'm not . I 'm not you 're girlfriend . You okay ? I kick ass . Who are you ? I 'm Echo . And who is that ? She 's nobody . I 'm just the porch light , waiting for you . You have to put me back . You have to put me back in that wedge . 'Cause we need to get ... Wendy back in her body . Why do you have to go back in the wedge ? Why don 't you come home ? I did sign a contract . I have 38 brains . Not one of them thinks you can sign a contract to be a slave , especially now that we have a black president . We have a black president ? Okay . I am missing everything . Yeah . Let 's do this . Caroline ? Now , do what I say ... or I will blow your brain out . What 's this ? Background singer ? Background singer , ninja girl ? I don 't know why Alpha would imprint her as a background singer unless he was starting an evil band . Nope . Next . This is Topher . Topher . Question . When Alpha was an Active , did he ever have any engagements that ended up in Pedro ? Uh , he had a lot of engagements , Boyd . Can you be more specific ? When Alpha was a civilian , he , uh , abducted a woman . Kept her captive for three days in some sort of defunct power plant . She escaped . Cops picked her up on the highway . Uh , get me Whiskey 1 . Too traumatized to find her way back there , but it was somewhere in San Pedro . Actually ... There was one engagement . He slipped his handler . It was a double . He was with Whiskey 1.1 It took us a while to get a lock on his location . Wasn 't a place we 'd been before . It was a bit off-parameter . Here it is . San Pedro . Industrial road 7-18 . Thanks , Topher . Whiskey . He 's using an old Whiskey imprint . Get in the chair . What are you going to do ? Wipe me ? No , I 'm going to put her in you . That 's what you wanted , isn 't it ? Of course , then I 'm going to kill you ! That 's a little elaborate . Then why don 't you just shoot me and the damn wedge ? I 'm not going to shoot the wedge . I 'm going to keep the wedge . I 'm going to use the wedge . And I 'm going to grab Wendys and Beckys and Stacys from all over this great nation , and every one of them will be a Caroline . And every one one of them will get carved up and their throat cut until I get bored . So , get in the chair ! You like knives . And scissors . You like to cut things , don 't you ? Whiskey . You cut up that poor girl because of me . For you . It was for you . Save it ! Don 't hand me any more of your crap about you being some superior ascended being . To ascend to anything , at minimum , you don 't cut up women ! Lay back in the chair . You lay back in the chair . I 'm done laying back in the chair ! I 'm ready to rinse and spit . I will shoot it . I will blast the wedge ! So blast it . What 's stopping you , Edward Scissor Pud ? I 'm not fooling . He 's not kidding ! We 're not bluffing . I 'm bluffing . But the rest of us ... we mean business . I said shoot it ! I don 't care . Yeah ? Well , maybe she will . She won 't know . She 's me . And we 're both coming to get ya . Want to bet it 's stolen ? He 's up there . Caroline 's up there ! I see . You want to save the girl ? Go get her . You saved her . Dr. Saunders ? I think you gave me more computer skills than would be required by a medical doctor . It was very easy for me to hack your system . I 'm curious . About ? Well , I guess I understand why they wouldn 't want to waste an investment . And I suppose , why hire a new physician when you can just ... imprint the broken Doll . But why did you decide it was very important for me to hate you ? I think that 's strange . You didn 't open it . No . Aren 't you curious to see who you really are ? I know who I am . So he continues to elude us . He does . And the poor child at the warehouse ? An anonymous source is providing generously for her family . It 's cold comfort . We 'll find him . I have confidence now . Our new contractor has the skills to inspire it . I don 't work for you yet . Remember our deal . The young lady 's freedom has been granted . With full payment on her contract . Of course . Yep ? Send her in . Come in , my dear . I just have a few things for you to sign . And then our business will be completed . Thank you . Hello . Hello . Did I fall asleep ? For a little while . Okay , you can go now . Thank you . Victor . It was so easy . I feel like I just got here . Of course . Okay . Thanks again . Good-bye . Excuse me . Shall I go now ? If you like . I don 't think I got your name . Madeline . Madeline Costley . Madeline . That 's a lovely name . And you are ? I 'm nobody . Caroline .

 " Save the Planet " . Whenever I 've read that bumper sticker , I had to laugh . Save The Planet ... what for ? And from what ? From ourselves ? Life 's simple , kill or be killed . Don 't get involved and always finish the job . A Survivor 's code , my code . It all sounds great ... 'till the day you find yourself confronted with a choice . A choice to make a difference ... to help someone , or to walk away and save yourself . I learned something that day , you can 't always walk away . Too bad it was the day I died . Get up ! Move it . Get back . Remember me ? You sold me a gun that don 't work , you almost got me killed . I paid you $ 20.00 for it , I want my money back . Give me that . - How much ? - $ 15.00 . How much ? - Alright , $ 12.50 . - Okay . - Thank you . - Goodbye . - Ouch . - Watch out . I 'll owe you . - That 's rabbit ? - I 'll save you some . Okay , Toorope . Hey , Toorope ! Toorope , somebody came by looking for you . Real good . ... what a massacre ! ... at the peak of the rush hour , bombs were detonated in ... Let 's go , Toorope ! Karl is that you ? I 'm not gonna ask again ! Let 's go ! I thought you were over the Sudan killing babies . - Shut up ! - Remember the last time we met . I told you if you ever point that gun at me again ... - I 'd kill you . - Let 's go ! Who would hire a babykiller to get me ? - Watch out ! - Who ? - Let 's get him ! - Hold your fire . No shit , Karl ! If you wanted me dead you would 've blown up the building . - Who ? - Gorsky Karl , you 're a disgrace to the profession ... you 're not a mercenary , you 're a terrorist . You need two things to live in this business ... your balls and your word , you don 't have either . You know the difference between you and me , Karl ? I still got both . You killed him ! - What the hell 's this ? - Take it easy . What 'd you do that for ? Why did you kill him ? Personal between him and me . You are a hard man to find , Toorope . I 'm not hiding , You could have knocked . I needed to be sure that you are the same idealist ... who worked for me 10 years ago . So you knew , I was gonna kill Karl . I don 't like you , Gorsky ... you can 't trust me and I can 't trust you . Look at you ... still in this shit-hole , surviving , no friends ... no family , no future . We are the same , You and me . We 're not the same . What do you want ? I need a smuggler . I don 't do refugees anymore , use your own cargo ... you own the borders anyway . - Only on this side . - This is an overseas delivery ? A girl , she needs to be in America in 6 days . Why 're you playing with me ? You know I can 't get back to that country . You know the U.N. passports , are impossible to fake . This is not a fake . Inject it in your neck when you pass the official border . This is your new life . - I 'll do it for half a mill . - I can make you do it for free . You can 't make me do shit , Gorsky ... but you could pay me what I need , so I can get the job done right . A car will pick you up outside ... everything you need , will be in the trunk . Cross me and you 'll have no place to hide anymore . Toorope . That goes both ways ... Gorsky . Shit ... Good morning , you must be Toorope . I am sister Rebeka .

They die ! They die ! They die ! Jesus , Mary and Joseph . What the hell was that ? When I was 17 years old , living in San Francisco ... my life was a mess . I met the wrong man , I was lost in darkness . But when the high priestess of our church opened the doors ... that led me into the path of light . I joined the Noelites , and I ended up in the convent . It was the heaven for women , who needed to heal . I worked in the orphanage ... she arrived . A little baby . Her father was dead , nobody knew anything about the mother . I took her as my own , I fed her , I taught her . Everything was fine , until 3 months ago . The doctor came , he gave her a pill , he was with her for 10 minutes ... and she slowly started to change , huh ? Schizophrenia , spasms . And nothing , nothing as violent as what you saw today . But how could she know , how to operate a 30 year old Russian sub ? She 's always known things , that she never experienced . Aurora could speak when she was 2 years old . I 've never met a kid that can 't speak at 2 years old . 19 different languages . - Who else knows about this ? - Nobody but the Doctor . He told me to keep it the secret to protect her . He said ... that we would get the best medical help in the America .. She needs help . Crew , get ready to surface ... Get her ready . You know , two years ago ... In Ouzbekistan I saw this viral bomb go off . I saw it from the air , it was ... incredible , everybody died . She 's carrying , ain 't she ? All the symptoms fit , all that weird behaviour . I 'm telling you man she 's carrying ... a weapon . Do you have any idea , how much money she 's worth ? If she 's carrying a virus ... I 'll kill her myself and burn the body . BERING STRAIT ALASKA What happened to them ? Fire Drones , anything that moves is shot on sight . It 's 10 miles to the D.M.Z. Then , let 's make it 10 fast miles . Let 's go . Toorope , they 're coming ... Shit , we got spotted . Hit it ! Break . Finn , get close to me . Jump onto his bike . I 'll throw them off . What are you doing ? Toorope clearing a way out . We 're only a mile from the border . - Toorope ! We need help . - Don 't worry ... We 're almost there . - Toorope , we need you now . - Hang on , I 'm getting there ... Stop ! We have to get Toorope . Toorope ! He 's not dead . Ahh ... shit ! Hey , stay with me . He 's not reacting . He 's bleeding to death , I need your help , okay ? We gotta get outta here , now . It 's a small piece of metal . - I 'm gonna take it out ... - What do you need ? Just hold him . Look , we don 't have time for this , okay ? - They 're gonna send more Drones . - ... Aurora ? - Have you got it ? - I 've got it . - It 's okay . - Give me a bandage . We should never have come back . He knows the rules . I 'll save that later . Hey ... - now you and the passport are mine . - What are you doing ? You ... I don 't need . Like I said , trust no one . No Man . It 's good ! Where did you learn to cook ? Rule number one in the mercenary handbook . You never had a woman take care of you ? Auh ! Sorry . No , not in my line of work . - Ahh ! - Finished . - She get 's pleasure out of it . - Cry Baby . Cry Baby ? What is that ? Pain Killer . - No , thank you . - Come on , live a little . No . Aurora , stop ! Spit it out . Girls ! ... We made it across the border . Here is to survival ... and thank you for saving my life . Maybe now you can trust somebody . We protected each other Like family . We 're all going to die in New York . Good night . She 's just scared . Yeah , right . Go back to sleep . We still have a long way ahead of us . What are you doing ? We go through customs tomorrow . Can 't take these . You know , when sister Rebeka first hugged me as a baby ... it was a night like this . Aurora , that 's where I got my name , from the Chaos . It suits you . You 're risking your life for me , why ? I 've done my time . All this killing and pain and ... war , for what ? I 'm tired . Tired of it all . You 're my only chance out of this now . And go where ? 27 Cedar Grove . Near Canada , it 's upstate New York . Where my parents had a farm ... more like a cabin with a lotta land , it 's probably in ruins ... but I might be able to fix it up . There is no place like home . Even Kansas is not what it used to be . The Wizard of Oz . 1939 . That 's right . Toorope . Are you really going to kill me and burn my body ? I hope I won 't have to . In 30 minutes , the bus leaves in 30 minutes . There 's a plane to New York , in two hours . Passengers , on flight 712 to New York ... please proceed to gate 211 for immdediate boarding . You are now leaving Canada . We hope you enjoyed your stay . Welcome to the United States of America . Welcome to America . Welcome to America . Welcome to America . Stop ! A miracle in the making . Trust invested by a new faith . Tomorrow is the dawn of our New Age . All them we 've changed , we 've changed . Right here , girls . It 's okay , it 's safe here . Here . Can we turn it off ? Can 't turn it off , you change the channel . Hey , there 's no food . Guess , we 're not gonna be here long . What 's wrong ? They 're all dead . Sources reported destruction in Kurdistan ... of a 1000 year old convent . One of the oldest continually functioning convents ... in Central Asia . Now occupied by the ascetic branch of the Noelites . The convent was strucked by a missile late last night . There were no survivors . Here an initial reaction from the Noelites . It is a tragedy to think , that even defenseless women ... who made the choice to withdraw from society and lead a life of purity ... could suffer the attacks of terrorists , who have absolutly ... no respect for the lives of decent , god-fearing people . We shall mourn our sisters . The Noelites have been persecuted for too long . Tomorrow will be the dawn of a new age ... Congratulations , my friend . - You made it safe and sound . - Gorsky . - Did you destroyed that convent ? - I 'm not a terrorist , Toorope . - I 'm a mercenary like you . - Bullshit . What the hell ... is going on over here ? You 've done your job , when you turn over the girl ... I 'll get paid and you 're home free . And that tracking device in your passport will be deactivated . Deliver the package , my men will be there to make sure you do . They never hurt anybody . - Maybe it was an accident . - It was not an accident . It was destroyed right after we crossed the border . Would you like to pray with me ? I don 't feel like praying anymore . Toorope said I 'm just a package to him . Is that all I am to you ? Of course not , I love you . How is she ? - Scared . - Well , she should be . Who are they ? To the left , the range rover guys , work for your sect the Noelites . To the right , the bikers work for Gorsky . They 're all here to make sure I deliver . And if you don 't ? It 's gonna be a free fall . Look sister . We traveled six thousand miles together . The truth is , this has been a suicide mission from the beginning . They won 't let either one of us walk outta here alive . That 's the doctor , that came to the convent 3 months ago . Answer the door , act like nothing is wrong . Okay . - Good evening , sister . - Good evening . Good evening . - Where is she ? - In her room . You 're a bad man . Thank you Aurora , Thank you so much . - How is she ? - She 's fine . - I have to run some more tests . - More tests ? Hey ! What is wrong her ? What 's wrong her ? - I 'm expecting a call from a client . - What is wrong with her ? Toorope ... Toorope ... let him go . If you , Please . Thank you , sister . - Get over here . - What 's wrong with you ? I wanna know everything that you know . Don 't you think that if I knew anything , I will tell you ? No , I don 't think . You 're a Noelite , you 're like him , you swore an oath . Not to them , to God . God has nothing to do with it now . You understand , if she carried a virus that could annihilate half the city ... I 'm not gonna have it on my conscience . I 'm pregnant ... twins . It 's not possible , I watched over you all your life . No one 's ever touched you . And nobody has . It 's a miracle . Shit ... - Hello ? - Mr. Toorope ? - This is the high priestess , I am ... - I know who you are . Thank you , for doing such a good job , Mr. Toorope . You 're welcome . Bring the girl to the limousine and you 'll be freed and rich . Toorope , if you deliver me to them , I 'll die . One other the way out . - We can 't let her go , Toorope . - Look around , do we have a choice ? She 's your problem now . Move ! - We 're going on the subway . - Thank you , Toorope . What 's wrong ? It 's a missile linked to my passport . How can you stop it ? Only by death . We 're going on the subway . Toorope ! Aurora ! It 's you . Protect them . I need you to live . Aurora was our miracle . A true virgin birth . It was to make ours ... the dominant religion on earth . Now we don 't know what 's happened to her . In this mess , there 's no sign of Aurora . We can 't find her . We were finally on the verge of becoming a bonafide religion ... and your incompetence has thrown 20 years of careful planning ... down the tubes . Who gave the order to use guns to retrieve her ? You left Gorsky no choice ... What were you thinking ? - Your Highness . - What ? The body stolen from the morgue was Toorope . The police found the van that transported him , in New Jersey . Who would want to abduct the body of a dead man ? He 's back on line . - Where 're you taking me ? - To Dr. Darquandier . Mr. Toorope is not a prisoner ... you can release him . Good evening , Mr. Toorope . I 'm Dr. Darquandier , Aurora 's father . - I thought you were dead . - It 's sometimes useful to be dead ... gives the last one a second chance . You 'll see . Oh yes , you were clinically dead for 2 hours . We lost quite a bit of time getting you from the morgue . And then you went into a coma for 5 days . I fixed you up as best I could . Now , Mr. Toorope , I believe I owe you some explanation . You see , 20 years ago I was drummed out of the medical profession . for trying to implant human babies with artificial intelligence . Around that time , the Noelites came to me to create smarter ... stronger , healthier human beings . So I built a super computer to be Aurora 's artificail mother . As a fetus Aurora learned to process information ... just like a computer . Until she was born , she became much more than just an experiment ... you see , she became she became my daughter . She was beautiful , she was unique , and I couldn 't bring myself ... to give her away , so ... that 's when they hired Gorsky to kill me and ... well ... they almost suceeded . He took my baby away and hid her to the Noelites , I searched for her for years , but I couldn 't find her . I knew , that one day the Noelites would have ... to present a miracle to the rest of the world . - What do you want from me ? - I want you to find my daughter . We think she 's alive ... and she left you a message , you died with your eyes open ... but your brain recorded more than you can actually remember , we just need to rewind the tape . You need to return to the same condition you were when we found you . Almost dead ? Quite . What am I looking for ? What you missed the first time . Will guide your memory with our computer . Are you ready , Mr. Toorope ? Stay with memory ... stay with the memory , move forward a little bit . Focus on the memories of Aurora . You 're beginning to see her , very good . That 's right , we 're getting there , We 're getting there . Now is good , focus on his gun . Easy , easy , steady , steady . He is way past the danger threshold . I know , but he 'll be fine , he 'll be fine . Okay , slow down ! Slow down now. slow down ! Let 's wait , let 's wait ... I need you to live . He 's dead . Wait ... Don 't bring him back yet , he 's almost there , the last seconds . G O H O M E. Alright , it 's alright , Toorope , you 're back , you 're safe , you 're alright . - you 're fine . - I know where she is . Mr. Gorsky , I hoped , I wouldn 't have to see you again . Where is my Money ? You still haven 't paid me . You have an odd way of killing people . What are you talking about ? I 'm on my way to see our old friend , Darquandier . Impossible , I made his car explode myself . Mr. Gorsky , when I kill I kill for good . - Are you threatening me ? - Bless your soul . You 'll need a nuke to kill me . Bitch . How did she survived the blast ? It 's the babies you see ... They gain in power ... they 're the ones who guiding her . Their aptitude for survival , is greater than ... anything you could ever have imagined . Professor ... your wife has found us ... she should be here in two minutes . Find a door open , you 're the only one who can save her now . So , where we going ? North . Hello my dear , it 's lovely to see you . Where is my daughter ? I see you haven 't found her . And you never will . You selfish bastard . 20 years ago I gave you the opportunity you wanted . Now it 's my moment . - Where is my daughter ? - She 's not your daughter . - She comes from me . - I designed her . For me , she 's my miracle , she belongs to my church . Your church is a lie ... you play with miracles , for your own profit . - Are you willing to die for her ? - Yes . Find Toorope . He knows where she is . Wait here . - You 're finally home - What 's left of it . But I came back for you . Have a little faith . Toorope ! They 're coming . Quick left . Toorope , they need help . No ! ... Take the wheel . Toorope . Thank you . For protecting us . You 're their father now . Aurora . That 's the first time , you said my name . You 're gonna be okay . Take care of them , Toorope . Hey kids ... There is a storm coming , we need to go . - You ready ? - Okay , Dad .

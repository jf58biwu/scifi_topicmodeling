 ( HIRO SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) I can hear rain coming from 40 miles away . I can even hear someone 's moods . MOHINDER : There are others out there like you . I can feel them . We 'II find them , Mohinder , all of them . It 's our destiny . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) I was surprised to Iearn the Linderman group recently invested in your campaign . I don 't know why you 'd be surprised . Mr. Linderman was a good friend of my father 's . What Mr. Linderman wants , Mr. Linderman gets . Bang . Has he been located ? The Haitian ? No . How long was he hiding claire ? I take it it 's been months . Just one more thing . When should we be expecting claire ? MR. BENNET : I 'll bring her in now . I wanted to protect you . I tried to be the best dad I could . This is goodbye . You don 't have to do this . There can 't be any doubt cast on your father . claire , turn around . Cover your ears . Dad ! I Iove you , Dad . I Iove you , CIaire-bear . Go deep . Take anything that would lead them to her . Just one bullet , I can be a hero . Show yourself ! No . I thought she was you . It was supposed to be you . Can 't you do something ? She 's dead . Can 't be . It 's your fault . You did this . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) Hey , you stop right there . What is the problem ? I am here with tour from Osaka . Security just flagged you . You must be some kind of cheat . What ? You already got a warning , and most people don 't even get that . Oh ! Oh ! It is okay ! I am invited now by Mr. Linderman . Well , in that case ... ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) It 's all gone . So you honestly don 't remember anything ? I told you . I 'm trying . The last thing I remember is driving home from the hospital with my wife , and after that , it 's just ... It 's gray , blank . Mmm-hmm . So Sprague and Parkman taking your family hostage , shooting your daughter , a bullet clean through your side , you 'd think something there might have made an impression . My daughter is missing , so right now , I don 't care if you believe me or what you do to me . I just want her home , safe . You can kill me if you want . I 'm gonna find her ! Settle down . You 'II tear your new stitches if you 're not careful . ( GRUNTING ) Hmm . Well , clearly , your partner 's gone rogue , taking a pie slice of your memory with him . He did the same thing to your wife and son . They remember even less . When can I go after them ? Sorry , can 't let that be your errand . She 's my daughter . She 's an assignment , or have you forgotten ? We gave her to you , took her out of a bassinet , put her in your hands and told you to take her home , and that 's after you said , " No , thank you . " Now , I appreciate you taking an interest in her beyond the needs of the assignment , but that indulgence ends now . You expect me to do nothing ? I expect you to do whatever we ask of you . Well , what do we think ? ( SIGHING ) He 's telling the truth . He doesn 't know anything . Hmm . You owe me five bucks . Come on . Wait . We had a deal . I help you out . You let me go . Take it easy , Parkman . We 'II get there . What ? Hey ! Hey ! You have not said anything all day . I thought you 'd prefer it . It 's not Iike you 'II tell me where we 're going anyway . As soon as I know where we 're going , I will tell you . When can I go back to my family ? Shall I lie to you and say it will be soon ? You know what we run from . Yeah , the people you and my dad work for . What they will do , not even you can recover from . Great . Thanks , Dad . You cannot understand the level of sacrifice he made so you might live . You must honor that . ( SPEAKING IN FRENCH ) Is it safe to go back ? No , we leave the country tonight . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Sorry , Mr. Petrelli , these men wanted to see you . They 're from the ... FBI . I 'm Federal Agent Quesada . This is Agent AIonzo . We 'd Iike to speak with you concerning illegal campaign contributions you may have received from the Linderman Group . The FBI is curious why the Las Vegas-based Linderman Group would be so interested in helping a New York candidate . My father served as an in-house attorney for the group before he passed away . It 's all right . We 're clear . No one 's listening . You agreed there 'd be no face-to-face . And you agreed to deliver Linderman . I 'm the one who brought you in here , remember ? I 'd appreciate a Iittle discretion as opposed to a surprise office visit . No one outside this office knows you 're working with us . Linderman 's requested a meeting with you at his casino tonight . Any guesses why ? I 'm still four points behind . He 's gonna tell me how he plans to put me ahead and what 's expected of me after I win . Yeah , we were thinking the same thing , and we want you to record it . You want me to wear a wire ? You 're the only one on our side who can get enough incriminating evidence to put him behind bars . We need this , Mr. Petrelli , and so do you . Otherwise , he walks . We 'II contact you when you land in Vegas . How long have you been working with the FBI ? Since Heidi 's accident . I 'm gonna take Linderman down for a Iong time , Peter . I thought I could be a hero , save the world . Instead , I just killed ... What is that ? That 's not your blood , is it ? No , it 's Simone . Isaac shot her . She 's dead . She 's dead . Did you call the police ? No . Okay , here 's what 's gonna happen . I 'm gonna make an anonymous phone call , okay ? You 'II have had absolutely nothing to do ... But I did . She 's dead because of me . I don 't know what to do . I insist that you don 't do anything . Do you understand ? This is not the time for you to get noble , okay ? Just stay with me . I can 't . I can 't . As long as I 'm alive , everyone around me is in danger . Suresh . We can call Suresh , okay ? He can study you . He can ... He 's working on a cure . Isn 't it too late for that ? ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Wait . MAN : Sir , you have your flight to Vegas . Just tell the driver to wait . Peter ! Well , there you are . Lyle 's watching pay-per-view in the other room . I 'm gonna run to the gym before there 's an ellipto-Iine . I tell you , that flood in our basement 's turned into a right vacation for this family . Too bad claire 's missing it all with that cheerleading retreat . ( DOG-BARK RINGTONE PLAYING ) Oh , I 'm not gonna answer that . I 've got the dog hotel giving me hourly updates on Mr. Muggles . They hate me . Sorry , I have to take a trip . Now ? What else ? You stay here , take care of Lyle . I 'II be back as soon as I can . If anyone comes looking for me ... Stop . ( OPERA PLAYING ON RADIO ) Stop . You can 't go . What are you doing ? Why are you whispering ? Because you told me to yesterday . I thought you didn 't remember anything about yesterday . You told me to pretend that that man took my memory . You took me in the shower . You told me everything . I told you ? What you really do , who you work for and what happened to claire . Do you know where she is ? Do you know why I can 't remember ? No , but you told me you were protecting her . You said you sent her away so she 'd be safe and that if you went after her , I should give you this . " claire 's with friends . Don 't go after her . " This is my writing . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) ( SIGHING ) AII right , look , we can 't let anybody know about this . Don 't worry . I know how to play dumb . I could never love you enough . You do fine . Puccini ? I thought of you more as a John Denver type . That your wife ? Your painter friend from New York tried to reach you . I chatted with him for you . Apparently , he 's got himself a dead girlfriend . Nice guy . Thompson doesn 't need me on this one . I need to be here with my family . This isn 't a request . This is an assignment . You do remember assignments , don 't you ? I 'II get my things . Yeah . Let me guess . Another paper emergency . Huge order mix-up in Fresno . Sorry for stealing your husband , Mrs. Bennet . It 's just that he 's the best guy we 've got in a pinch . I Iike your hair . So this is the list ? Yes , what 's left of it . Most of these people are missing or dead . I want to run your DNA sample against my father 's formula . I 'm gonna take you someplace safe . Wait . This is your father 's formula . This is how he made the list , how he found me . Yes , although I haven 't figured out what it is looking for . A specific gene , codons ? There are three billion base pairs in human DNA . It 's the proverbial needle . Did my DNA help ? ( SIGHING ) No . Okay , well , Mohinder , you 've been driving all night . Why don 't you just take a break ? I can 't . These people are in danger . We have to warn them . If Sylar gets to them first ... Exactly , so let me help . I mean , here . Now , this one is in New York . I 'II ... Isaac Mendez . I 'II call him , and you just relax , just take a minute . You 're very kind , Zane . Thank you . ( KETTLE WHISTLING ) You have no idea how alone I used to feel , how insignificant . You 've given me hope . Hope is great . We need caffeine . So , this formula , if you figure it out , how many of us will you find ? Who knows ? Hundreds ? Thousands ? Maybe more . No . It 's busy . I 'II get him later . To new friends . This is good . What is it ? Chai . It 's a special blend my father brought from India . ( CLEARING THROAT ) Who are we gonna call next ? No one . I already have you , Mr. Sylar . Hiro ? Mr. Petrelli ? Yeah . flying ... ( SHUSHING ) Not here . Sorry . flying man . Yeah . Let me guess . You 're still trying to steal that sword from Mr. Linderman ? Where 's your friend ? Ando ? I sent him back to Japan . This mission getting too dangerous for him . I think I know what you mean . You can 't protect everyone , right ? Sometimes it 's better to go it alone . The more people you try and help ... The more people get hurt . Yeah . please , you must help me . I can 't get past casino-security giant . When I first met you , I thought you were nuts . It 's okay . I thought you were mean , but now I know . You pretend you do not care about anyone , but you care too much . It 's really important to you to get your powers back , huh ? It is important for everyone . Follow me . You know who I am ? Of course , Mr. Petrelli . My friend here is making a delivery from me to Mr. Linderman , something he 's expecting . Oh , I didn 't realize ... You look like you 've been around long enough to know what happens when Mr. Linderman doesn 't get something he 's expecting , or do I have to paint you a picture ? He can take it to the curator . That work for you ? Vivian Lewis ? My name is Vivian , and I 'm from Canada ? Are you kidding me ? I do not need you happy , only safe . There 's nothing left of me . Everything I am is gonna disappear the second I get on that plane . My friends , my family , me . I can make you forget it all if that 's what you would prefer . There 's nothing left for you here , no one to trust . No , you cannot see him again . Peter Petrelli is the only person I know I can trust , more than you . He cares about me . Why can 't I hide in New York with him ? He 's not in a position to be responsible , for you or himself . Come . Boarding pass and ID ? Boarding pass , ID ? Boarding pass and ID ? Sorry , sir , only ticketed passengers are allowed beyond this point . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) DETECTIVE TRACY : Isaac Mendez . NYPD . We have a few questions for you . Mr. Mendez ? Detective Jeff Tracy , NYPD . You know this woman , Simone Deveaux ? She and I , we broke up recently . We received an anonymous phone call that she might be hurt . Some of your neighbors said they heard an argument , then gunshots . You mind if we take a look around ? Isaac , what 's going on ? Something wrong ? No , ma 'am , apparently not . Sorry for taking your time . Simone , you 're alive . Lucky you . My , you 're very useful . Candice is special , just like you . And Simone 's ... She 's traveling Europe indefinitely as far as the rest of the world is concerned . There 's a crew coming to clean up this mess . How am I supposed to pretend this didn 't happen ? Maybe you should have thought about that before you shot her , twice . What 's the matter , sweetie ? You want to shoot me again ? Enough . ( SIGHING ) I can 't stay here . Take me with you . That 's not our assignment . please , I don 't know what to do . Of course you do . You keep painting . My condolences . JESSICA : Here we go . When did you get so good ? I 'm unemployed . What do you think I do all day when you 're at school ? Wow . One more ? I can 't . I 'm gonna be late for the bus . So be late . You 're not gonna learn anything at school that you don 't already know . Love you . ( SIGHING ) You know , you have to admit it , Niki . I do a better you than you . Did you think I wouldn 't find out ? About what ? Where 'd you get that ? It was on my pillow . Well , I didn 't put it there . Were you digging through my stuff ? Don 't turn this around on me , Niki . You said no more secrets . Now I find out you 're going to Linderman 's casino . For what ? What they got you doing with this guy ? It 's nothing . Linderman called , and he asked me to be a dealer . That 's it . You know you 're not talking about just dealing cards , here . That 's all this is . Don 't you trust me ? I promise you , I won 't do anything that I don 't want to , all right ? You left that for him , didn 't you ? Cute . I can 't feel my fingers . It 's the curare . It induces paralysis of the brain , which means you can 't control your abilities . Whoever you think I am , I 'm not . You are the man who murdered my father , or do you still expect me to believe you 're Zane Taylor ? Zane was killed three days ago , the same day I met you , and you thought you were so clever giving me his DNA . You 're a parasite . You killed my father and fed off his work . ( SCREAMING ) Let me hear you say it . Tell me your name ! Say it ! I want to hear you say it ! Sylar ! ( PANTING ) There 's only one thing to do with a parasite , kill it before it kills again . You 're just like your father . Murderers , the both of you . I 'm a scientist . Your father said that , but he kept leading me ... He had no idea what you were . He knew . He might not have admitted it , but , after all , we were making so much progress together . Why would he stop ? You know nothing about my father ! I know everything . He confided in me . He told me things he felt he could never tell you , things about your sister , Shanti . He thought you were too ... What 's the word ? Fragile to know the truth . That 's why he liked me . You were always seeking his approval , while I provided stimulation . He gave up on you , but he adored me . Now , who 's the real parasite , here ? You 're right . My father did want answers . He called you Patient Zero . You 're the template he used to create this formula . You 're the key to unlocking its secret . As much as I 'd Iike to , killing you will not give me what I need . So what are you gonna do ? I 'm going to take a sample of your spinal fluid , and it 's going to hurt . Might actually do some good before you die . ( SCREAMING ) There are so few Dead Sea fragments left in the world . Be a pity if you crushed this one . So many things . You 've brought the new Mendez . This one is very special . This painting is ripped and repaired with scotch tape . Yes , very special . Is there something else ? I need receipt for delivery . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) There are 754 members of the security team in this hotel , all of them with the instructions to drop what they are doing and come running if I push this button . COMPUTER : Security , code orange , activated . That sword you thought you 'd steal , do you even realize who it belonged to ? Takezo Kensei , he was a hero . Security , sir . This man tried to steal from Mr. Linderman . Hiro . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) SECURITY GUARD 1 : Come on , open up ! SECURITY GUARD 2 : Open up ! The big guy says Linderman 's gonna be asking for me in about an hour . I 'm not in the mood for craps . I 'm gonna go straight to my room . I guess it 's hard to act natural when you 're going after the whale . Maybe he 'II chat up a few more Japanese tourists . Where the hell is that pizza ? ( DOOR KICKED OPEN ) Hi . Hi , Agent AIonzo , Quesada . Mr. Linderman sends his regards and a suggestion . Don 't run surveillance on a man from inside his own hotel . It 's really tacky . Kick over your guns . Down . It 's so much easier working with professionals . I finally found it . That 's it ! These four simple genes , they answer everything . Now , I can make a new list . I can find them , save them . And what about me ? Don 't I deserve to be saved ? Aren 't I just a victim , too ? I didn 't ask for this . And what would you have me do ? Help find a way . Give me salvation . Give me your damn list so I can sink my teeth in ! I 'm the natural progression of the species . Evolution is a part of nature , and nature kills . Simple , right ? What you 've done is not evolution . It 's murder . What I am doing is revenge . Now , I can fulfill my duty as a son . I wasn 't begging for my Iife . I was offering you yours . You are your father 's son . So determined , you didn 't even notice I stopped the IV . Don 't worry . You might actually do some good before you die , starting with that list . I 'm back in my room . I 'II be on the floor in an hour . Wearing this could get a person killed . Okay , it 's all right . Easy . Listen to me . I don 't know how much time we have before she comes back . Who ? Jessica , the woman that they sent after you . You picked the wrong day to screw with me . Linderman knows about the wire and the FBI . Then you know the FBI can hear everything we 're saying . No , they can 't . They 're dead . Linderman knows that you turned on him . Did you come here to kill me or warn me ? Just trust me . Well , you 're back early . Hey , good news . I convinced the hotel to let us keep Mr. Muggles in the room . That is good news . I 've been going out of my head , thinking everybody 's watching me , waiting for me to make a mistake . Did you find her ? No , I can 't do that . If I know where she is , they can extract it from me . I need you to be strong a Iittle while longer . We both have to pretend that we have no idea what happened so claire will be safe . But the company ... Has to be stopped for good . That 's the only way to make sure that claire will stay safe . I didn 't know that I could talk to you Iike this . I always just thought that you 'd be so furious at me for all the lies and deceit . Right now , we just have to take care of claire . We 'II talk about us later . ( PHONE RINGING ) Must be the kennel . ( SIGHING ) Hello ? Yes , he is . Yes , he is going to be a problem . Why don 't we do it right now ? ( WHISPERING ) One second . Sorry . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( SECURITY GUARDS SHOUTING ) ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) Get over here ! ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) I 'm sorry . I hope I have the right address . I 'm looking for Peter Petrelli . You picked a terrible time to do that . Peter 's not here just now . You may as well come inside , claire . ( SPEAKING IN FRENCH ) Who are you ? I 'm your grandmother , and I 've been trying to protect you , but you haven 't made that very easy . Quite stubborn , aren 't you ? Just like your father . Linderman hired her to kill the FBI and keep you in line . Who ? Let 's just say I owe her . He 's gonna offer you a deal . If you go in there , you have to take it . Spend the rest of my Iife with his boot on my neck ? No , thank you . Then run . Get your family and run . You said that you had kids . Two boys ? I can 't do that . You don 't have any other option . Yeah , I do . I could kill him . Then knock me out . Why ? So Jessica knows she 's not in control anymore . Who 's Jessica ? You want this gun ? Do it . Not up there . Mr. Linderman won 't be meeting you in his office . Mr. Linderman ? Right . Do you enjoy vegetables , Mr. Petrelli ? I 've been known to eat zucchini when the mood strikes , but not as a rule . You know , you can probably hire someone to do that for you . Oh , yeah , I Iike to cook . It 's my meditation . One aims for perfection in one 's life , but one doesn 't find it very often . For me , this is about as close as it gets . Voilà ! A pot pie , wholesome , warm , healthy . That 's , of course , if you can live without the cream sauce . Personally , I can 't . I mean , what 's the point ? You know , people can sleep , or they can gamble , or they can even make love when they 're miserable , but I think that most people eat when they 're happy . I Iike to see people happy . Are you happy , Nathan ? Not especially . I guess I have a few issues that plague me . Oh , dear , I 'm sorry to hear that . You see , I think there comes a time when a man has to ask himself whether he wants a life of happiness or a life of meaning . I 'd Iike to have both . ( LINDERMAN CHUCKLING ) Can 't be done . Two very different paths . I mean , to be truly happy , a man must live absolutely in the present . I mean , with no thought of what 's gone before and no thought of what lies ahead . But for a life of meaning , a man is condemned to wallow in the past and obsess about the future . My guess is that you 've done quite a bit of obsessing about yours these last few days . Now , you can 't have any of my pot pie . I won 't hold it against you . Lots of men have tried to kill me . Then I 'II be the Iast . Of course , you can pull that trigger , Nathan . You 'd be taking both of our lives . You 'II be dead within moments . Or I could offer you something . I 'm not interested in anything you have to offer me . I think you are . I think there are things you need to hear , things that I know about . Too late for that . That you can fly , for instance , or about your brother , Peter , and his small problem . Your daughter , even , and all those others out there like you . I can offer you more than just information , Nathan . You 're gonna win your election . I 'II see to that . And two years from now , through a series of fluke circumstances , you will find yourself in the White House , a heartbeat away from the Presidency . A life of meaning , Nathan . Think about it . The choice is yours . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Suresh ? Suresh ? It 's Peter Petrelli . Mohinder ? Sylar . I remember you . You 're like me , aren 't you ? I 'd Iike to see how that works .

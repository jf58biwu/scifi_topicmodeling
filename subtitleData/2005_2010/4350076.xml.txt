 [ Wedeck ] On October 6th , the planet blacked out for two minutes and 17 seconds . The whole world saw the future . I saw someone drowning me . How do I atone for something I haven 't done yet ? The man you might be sleeping with in six months ' time was in our living room , and I didn 't bring him into our lives . You did ! All the old patterns are back , Mark . It 's about trust , and we don 't trust each other anymore . I had a vision of Fiona Banks . Let 's see if she had a vision of me . I know why you 're calling . Something to do with the Rutherford case . [ Demetri ] You 've been acting weird for a couple of weeks . Blue hand . That 's a clue from Mark 's board . [ Al ] Dear Celia , I don 't know your last name , and I don 't know where you live . But I know you have two young boys . Twins , I believe . And I know you didn 't have a flash forward . I understand how terrifying that is , and how powerless you must be feeling . But I want you to know that you are not alone . - Emailing your other girlfriend ? - No , we , uh ... We broke up . - This is just porn . - Oh , OK . I 'm in pretrial conference , totally unreachable . Don 't forget we need to sign off on the proofs . - Proofs ? - For the wedding invitations . Right . Bet you 20 bucks they spell my name wrong . Bet you 100 they got mine wrong . You know , they say couples with commonly misspelled names - are the most successful . - Really ? [ Zoey ] Mm-hmm . Meet me at the printers at six , OK ? - Can 't you just pick one ? - I 'm gonna pretend I didn 't hear that . I 'm just saying , you have great taste . I mean , I don 't need to be there . Right ? Hey , kick ass today ! [ Door opens , closes ] I might be home a little late tonight . I 'm covering the ER for Sally again . - I tried to get out of it , but ... - You don 't have to explain . It 's hard ' cause Crosby 's out of town , there really is no one else . Olivia , you don 't have to explain . I trust you . Good . I trust you , too . - [ Door closing ] - [ Object clattering ] It 's like everything I say comes out wrong . Everything . Even when we 're getting along , it 's tense . Things have changed for everybody . It 's a new world . Yeah ? I miss the old one , then . Really ? Where you used to crash on my couch playing Madden till 4 : 00am ? Don 't you mean futon ? And don 't you mean kicking your ass until 4 : 00am ? - What ? - What ? I said it . No . You didn 't kick anything . You were ... You were cheating . That 's what you were doing . Hey , man , what you call " cheating , " I call finding a way to change the game . - Oh ... - [ elevator bell dings ] - How 's Agent Hawk doing ? - She 's out of the woods . She 'll be back to work in a few weeks . These three had something to do with her shooting ? Well , we followed the hand stamp from the guy who shot Janis . Led us to the house where we found these guys . The blue hand stamp ? I 'm sensing a theme . Yeah ? You wanna share ? The contact ring , residue patterns and bullet trajectories are consistent with self-inflicted gunshot wounds . Self-inflicted ? You think this is some kind of suicide pact ? Had to be . But then , who arranged the bodies and covered them with the sheets that night ? All had alcohol in their systems . She had Ecstasy and heroin . Dem , who are these people ? Jason Martinez , 37 . Married , two children . This is Diana Davis , still looking for next of kin . And lan Rutherford , 25 . British national . Reported missing from a cargo vessel docked in Long Beach . - Your Rutherford case ? - Yeah . - There are two possible ... [ gasps ] - [ Thudding ] Here we go . - It was ... - Hang on . - Hey , Aaron . - What 's up , Jack ? There 's a guy waiting for you inside . Says he served with Tracy . [ Indistinct chattering ] - How can I help you ? - You 're Aaron Stark ? Corporal Mike Willingham . I 've been meaning to come talk to you , but I 've been mixed up . Trying to get a job , trying to get a place to live . It 's tough , readjusting to civilian life . Especially the way things are now . Hope it gets better . Yeah . Sorry to bother you at your place of work , but I promised Tracy that if anything ever happened to her , I 'd give you this . - How 'd you find me ? - I 'll always find you , kiddo . I think , right now , you need this more than I do . I hadn 't seen this knife since Tracy deployed four years ago . But somehow ... Now I understand how , in my flash forward , I was giving it back to her . She said it was a good luck charm . Maybe there 's something to that . For two years , I 've had to listen to people telling me to move on , to accept what happened to her . But I always knew I 'd see her again . And now , you showing up here , and ... It 's all happening , isn 't it ? It 's all happening . Thank you , Mike . Thank you . Why do a copy machine salesman , a librarian and a Scottish journalist decide to get together to shoot themselves ? Because print is dead ? Gough , say hello to your vision . You all know Fiona Banks . Ml6 . - Fresh off the plane from London . - Nice to meet you again for the first time . Yeah . Nice to meet you . Suicide seems a little low-incident for Ml6 . Lan Rutherford was reported missing off a cargo ship two weeks ago . The British Embassy was notified . I saw the report and came here because ... Because you knew you 'd be working on this case from your flash forward . That 's well and good , but what do we got in the present ? When I found out all three vics committed suicide , I cross-referenced their visions on Mosaic . Turns out they 're all ghosts . People who didn 't see anything in their flash forwards . - That 's what they call themselves . - So , none of them had visions and now they 're all dead . Am I the only one who finds that disturbing ? No , you 're not . Here , check this out . It 's a ghost website . It 's where they connect with each other , find out about upcoming events . Anchorage , Buenos Aires , Dubai . Whatever this is , it 's happening everywhere . [ Al ] " The Blue Hand . No limits . No fear . A place where ghosts can gather to embrace the inevitable . " You 've got to be kidding me . - A death club ? - Like a book club ... with bullets . Whatever it is , the guy who shot Janis is a part of it . We need to find these people , figure out who they are and shut them down . The next meeting in Los Angeles is being hosted by a guy named Raynaud . - Dr. Maurice Raynaud . - When 's the meeting ? [ Man ] Tonight , go downtown and check the time . Tonight , go downtown and check the time . Tonight , go downtown and check the time . Lan Blaine Rutherford . Born in Edinburgh , 1984 . Father 's an aviation mechanic . Mother ... Works in a factory . Makes cell phone components . - I 've already seen that file . - Yes , of course . [ laughs ] Sorry . I just never expected to be working on this case so soon . The dominos seem to be falling into place , don 't they ? It 's funny . I don 't remember anything from the actual dossier other than his name . I just remember you . And the bird . When it hit the window ... I literally felt my heart skip a beat . Then you had the phone call . Excuse me for a moment . After you left , I looked out onto the ledge . I went over . I wanted to help it if only to end its pain . But I couldn 't . That was the worst part . There was nothing I could do to stop it . [ Cell phone rings ] - What was your phone call about ? - It was my attorney . Why were you speaking to an attorney ? Did something happen ? I killed her . No . Everything was fine . Hey , babe . Hey , I 'm working downtown tonight . Thought I might stop by that bakery on Grand on the way back , pick us up some of those cinnamon rolls . Or not . You don 't have any idea why I 'm mad , do you ? - No . - The printers . Our invitations . Oh , my God . I 'm so sorry . Work was so crazy , all right ? We got a lead on the guy who shot Janis , and now we 're going to this underground ... You 're not the only one who had a crazy day . I 've been cranking out motions in limine all afternoon , but somehow , I made it to the printers anyway . You 're right . I suck . I should have been there . I 'm really sorry . No , it 's not about the invitations , Dem . It 's about you and me , and the fact that you 've been checked out ever since I got home from Seattle . You know I 've been slammed since the blackout . Since the blackout , your excuse for everything . Yeah , no . Why you 're late coming home . Why you don 't feel like talking . Why you shut your computer every time I walk in the room . - It 's like I don 't even exist . - Hey , that 's unfair . What 's unfair is being in love with someone who treats you like a stranger . That 's unfair . And I don 't want you to apologize . I don 't . I want you to want to be here . Talk to me . Just be honest about whatever 's going on . - You want me to be honest ? - Yes . The more you jump down my throat , the less I want to be here . How 's that for honesty ? - Demetri ! Dem ! - [ Door opens , slams closed ] [ Indistinct chatter ] Thanks so much for having me . Oh , not at all . We always need volunteers . I gotta tell you , there 's a lot of menial tasks , a lot of charts to be filed and blood to be run to the lab . - It 's not glamorous . - I 'm not looking for glamour . - [ Bryce ] Dr. Benford ? - You supposed to be at that conference ? Yeah , but lab 's lost the coags on our spider girl , the OR is trying to bump our appy another hour and volvulus guy is leaving AMA to see his kid in this Ice Capades thing . OK , so redraw the coags , tell the OR " no " and I 'll talk to skater dad . - Bryce , do you know Nicole ? - Uh ... Yeah . Yeah . I think we met at your Christmas party last year . Hi . Nicole 's volunteering . Shadow Bryce . He 'll show you the lay of the land . I will catch you later . - Thanks . - What 's volvulus ? Uh , twisted gut . You pre-med ? No , I 'm just volunteering . Helping people . You know . [ Speaking Japanese ] Um , ma 'am , slow down , we don 't understand you . [ Speaking Japanese ] [ Speaking Japanese ] Thank you . Sweet peas symbolize " goodbye " in Japanese culture . It 's considered a bad omen to give it to the sick . Ah . Is that a cardigan ? What ? I was going for " average Joe . " Back off , Dem . That jacket ? Ridiculous . Says the FBI agent in a Police T-shirt . Good going . - [ Scoffs ] - [ Demetri ] What ? " Go downtown . Check the time . " We 're here for the meeting . [ Industrial music plays ] At , uh ... Dr. Raynaud 's invitation . [ Indistinct chattering ] Who 's gonna play ? Play ? Who is going to play ? [ Gun clicks ] I get it . No bullets . Good gag . Your ticket in . Welcome to the Blue Hand , gentlemen . You got a death wish ? You could 've been killed . Not today . - [ Industrial music continues ] - [ Indistinct chattering ] That was a real bullet in that gun . You know that , right ? Unlike these people , I know I 'm gonna be alive in six months . I 've seen it . So bullet or no bullet , there 's no way I was gonna die tonight . - [ Mark ] Hey . - What can I get you ? Could you get us to talk to Raynaud ? Is he here ? - You guys first-timers ? - No . Maybe . The Raynaud changes at each gathering . And where 's tonight 's Raynaud ? He 's around . You 'll know him when you see him . - [ Demetri ] What you got ? - It was on my board . [ Al ] Another piece of the puzzle . So , what do we do here ? Anything you want . No limits . No fear . There 's something for everybody . - [ Animal growls ] - [ Object clatters ] Hi . Hi . - I really need to talk to you ... - I don 't think we should be doing ... - Uh , me first ? - Um , OK . OK . Fine . Um ... I just came by to say thank you for everything you 've done for Dylan . He did all the hard work himself . - Well , you saved his life . - I didn 't do ... And in doing that , um you saved mine as well . Look , the very last thing I would want to do is ruin yours . - I really don 't think we should ... - No , listen . I understand that this is really very awkward . So please just let me be perfectly clear . Nothing is going to happen between us . No . I know that . I would never do anything to come between you and your husband , despite what we may have seen or experienced . Good . OK , good . So Dylan and I are gonna move back to the Bay Area as soon as they approve the transfer . Good . Oh , good . That 's ... That 's good . You must be anxious to , um get back to work , and ... - Yeah , right . I should go , so ... Listen , um , thank you so much for everything , again . Yeah , I 'll do everything I can to push that transfer through . - OK , great . Thanks . - I 'm gonna ... This way . Thank you . Hey , where 'd you learn how to speak Japanese ? My Dad was stationed at Okinawa when I was little , I picked it up . When we moved back , I took it in school . Can I show you something ? Just for a second . Uh ... In my flash forward , I saw this symbol behind her . - Who 's the woman ? - I have no idea . I was hoping that if I could figure out what the symbol meant , I might be able to find her . I know it 's an Asian character , but nobody seems to recognize it . They didn 't see it because it wasn 't finished . You have a pen ? Yeah ... pencil . - May I ? - Please . There . It 's kanji . It 's a Japanese letter . - Kanji . What 's it mean ? - " Believe . " - [ Mike ] Mr. Stark . - Mike , what are you doing here ? Sorry to bother you again . I just ... Didn 't feel right , leaving things the way we did earlier . I 'm not sure I understand . It 's just ... You seemed so happy ... I didn 't know how to tell you . But I think you deserve to know the truth . - The truth about what ? - About what you saw in your vision with Tracy . It 's not possible . What are you talking about ? I was with her in the Humvee . Godfather , this is Hitman Two requesting backup . We 're Oscar Mike pursuing Hajjis heading north about two clicks away from checkpoint Victor Tango . Over . Damn ! [ Mike ] Who the hell are these guys ? Those aren 't Hajjis . [ Tracy ] Back up ! Those are Jericho ! We gotta get out . Move ! Burro ! Burro ! We 're gonna get waxed ! - Get out ! - Get out ! [ Mike ] Come on ! We gotta get out ! The door won 't open ! Tracy ! I 'm sorry , sir . When I went back to check on her ... Tracy ? Tracy ? [ Gunfire ] I had to run . I had to . But I saw her die . I saw her die . [ # Skold : I Will Not Forget ] [ Screams ] [ Indistinct shouting , screaming ] [ Mark ] This is pathetic . What have they got to lose , man ? Doesn 't matter if it 's tonight or next month . They 're dead anyway . [ Feedback ] [ All chanting ] Raynaud . Raynaud . [ Door closes ] Blue hands . They represent a portal . A gateway from one understanding to another . The blue hand marks a surrender to the inevitable . Raynaud . OK . - Here we go . You got me ? - [ Demetri ] Yeah . [ Mark ] FBI ! [ Screaming ] - Get down ! - [ Demetri ] Everybody down ! - Give me my gun ! - [ Mark ] FBI ! Get down ! Everybody down ! Give me my gun ! I want out . - Turn around . Turn around ! - I want this to end . Not today . Not today . " Dr. Maurice Raynaud . Discovered Raynaud 's phenomenon , also known as " blue hands . " Died 1881 . " It does beat your real name . Jeff Slingerland . Am I saying that right ? It says you taught American History at South Fairfax High . Teacher of the year , ' 08 . Then the blackout happens , and you turn into Friedrich Nietzsche . Why is that , Jeff ? Or do you prefer Dr. Raynaud ? You know what Nietzsche said . " If you gaze into the abyss , the abyss also gazes into you . " Is that the kind of optimism that comes from not having a vision ? Oh , I had a vision . A bottomless pit of darkness and indifference , infinite in its nothingness , as if I never existed at all and I never would again . These people who didn 't have a vision , these ghosts , where do you Raynauds find them ? We don 't find them . You do . There 's no better place to go than your Mosaic site . Couldn 't do it without you . Do you see this guy ? One of your fellow Blue Hands . Shot and nearly killed an FBI agent . Start talking or I 'm gonna charge you as an accomplice after the fact . All right , fine . Throw me in prison . I don 't care . It 's all mapped out . Don 't you understand ? The script for this conversation has been written . Whatever you 've all seen ... is gonna happen . What if you 're wrong ? What if April 29th comes and goes and you 're still alive ? - What then ? - You can run and you can hide , but you can 't escape what 's coming . No one can . - Heading out ? - Yes . Back to my luxury suite . They still putting agents up at those crappy hotels by the airport ? - Now you 're just rubbing it in . - You ever try dirty rice ? Dirty rice ? What , you mean like eating it off the floor ? No , no . It 's a Cajun dish . It 's my favorite . My mom makes it for me when I go home at the holidays . Thought I might make a batch of it tonight . If you 're feeling hungry ... That 's , uh , sweet of you . That really is , but I 'm jet-lagged . I understand . I 'd be tired , too . You know , I 've been thinking about our bird . - What if you taped the window ? - How do you mean ? Well , if you cover the window , the bird might not crash into it . It 's a nice thought . I think it will probably crash into a different window . Maybe . But it 's worth a shot . Hmm . Can 't accuse him of sugarcoating things . That guy makes Marilyn Manson look like Mr. Rogers . Everybody deals with it differently , I guess . - I 'm sorry , I ... - It 's all right . At least I don 't have to deal with the uncertainty . It is the one good thing about knowing the exact date of your murder . Gives you time to prepare . What 's gonna happen ? March 15th comes around , you 're just gonna pack it in ? - Come on , man . - Hmm ? Say your good-byes , - have a nice farewell dinner ? - I 'll deal with it the way I choose . Deal it with it by fighting . That 's what we 're doing . Wake up , would you , please ? Wake up ! D. Gibbons . The doll factory . One thirty-seven Sekunden . The blue hand . It 's all come true . - No . Listen , that doesn 't mean that ... - Mark . Look around you . Look around , man . Raynaud was right . It 's all happening . Every single day . There 's no way out . There 's nothing you , I or anyone can do to escape what 's coming . [ Man ] Give ya 20 bucks for it . [ Old man ] Though its pages blank , this tome possesses magicks beyond all comprehension ! It surges with power unimaginable ! It seethes with cosmic energies not meant for the yoke of mortal men lest they crumble under its senses-shattering omnipotence ! - [ man ] Yeah , give ya 30 . - [ old man ] Sold ! OK . I 'm tired . You 're tired . It 's time for bed . - Oh , Mommy , please ? - That 's all right . I got it . - OK , five minutes . - OK . - Five . - OK . - [ Olivia ] I love you . - [ Charlie ] I love you , too . Sleep well . Good night . [ Squirrelio ] Or a hammock obstacle with a big glass of obstacle lemonade ? [ Man ] Obstacles are problems , challenges , things ... - [ Charlie ] Daddy , are you sad ? - No , no , baby . Daddy 's happy . [ Demetri ] Got you something . I 'm not really hungry . But thanks . [ Sighs heavily ] I really do love you . You know that , right ? I know I 've ... I 've been distant lately , but I ... didn 't know how to tell you , or even what to tell you . [ Stuttering ] I didn 't know what to do . About ? About my flash forward . I told you I saw myself on the beach at our wedding . That was a lie . I didn 't see anything . Only darkness . Nothingness . I didn 't have a flash forward because I 'm gonna be dead . Tonight , I met all these people just like me . No visions . No hope . They were just waiting to die . I don 't want to be like that . I don 't want to be like that . I want to be here with you . - Dem . - Yes ? I know what I saw . The beach . Our wedding . I know you were there . You got to know how much I wanted that . I wanted to marry you , have a baby with you , - grow old with you . - It was a mistake . You just made a mistake . There 's no way of knowing for sure , so ... Zoey , I 'm sure . I 'm sure . Listen to me . I love you . I love you . You are the life that I wanted . Then let 's have that life . - Zoe . - We can have that life . You said you didn 't want to give up hope ? Then don 't . We have two conflicting visions . We can choose which one we want to believe in . I choose hope . You 're right . [ Indistinct chattering ] - Thanks for coming out . - [ Mike ] Is everything all right ? Everything 's fine . That 's why I called you out , actually . I thought you might be upset with me , sir , for telling you what I told you . I 've spent the last few weeks tortured by what I saw . Up and down . Living in limbo . But your story , what you told me ... You 've finally given me some peace . And I was hoping , maybe , I could return the favor . Wow . You won 't be the first screwed-up vet this place has hired . - Aaron , thank you . - No , thank you . You 're a real artist . You could totally sell these . Thanks . I 'd give them away for nothing if somebody could help me find her . Thanks . So you don 't remember her name or where she lives ? I remember the images , but I just can 't put them together . But you remember how you felt about her ? - [ Laughing ] - Oh , yeah . - You have to find her , Bryce . - How ? She could be anywhere . Well , look at your paintings . Look at her . It 's Japan . It has to be . Do you have any idea how many people live in Japan ? Put your story up on Mosaic . Even if she doesn 't see it , someone she knows might . It 's worth a shot . - [ Al ] Morning , guys . - Morning . - You coming to the meeting ? - You go ahead . Demetri . - Yeah . - I left something on your desk . Can you make sure it gets into the right hands ? Yeah . See you later . We 've got this Raynaud guy in custody . Now what ? He 's still refusing to name names , give us an idea of who 's in charge . My sense is these people aren 't killers , just lost , aggressive nihilists . Your sense ? You 've got to do better than that , Mark . You can break any perp . You 've gotta change your approach . [ Mark ] No . Raynaud 's different . Can 't threaten him with anything . He 's got nothing to lose . He has seen his future and it is bleak . He doesn 't even know how it 's gonna happen . It could be a fall , a fight , a shooting , a car accident . The possibilities are infinite . The guy is walking on eggshells every minute of the day just waiting for the hammer to drop . Hello ? [ Man ] Al , I just got off the phone with the hospital . They took her off life support an hour ago . I 'm sorry , Al . She 's gone . Every day he wakes up wondering if today is the day . If today is the day his future 's finally gonna catch up with him . What 's gonna happen to her children ? [ Man ] It looks like the kids will have to be placed in foster care . Those two boys are orphans because of me ? [ Man ] No . Celia 's death was an accident , OK ? It could 've happened to anyone . But it didn 't . It was my fault . I killed her . - [ Mark ] ... that doesn 't change any ... - Stop . Stop ! - Al ! - [ Wedeck ] Al ! - Al ! - [ Mark ] No , no , no . - [ Demetri ] Al ! - [ Mark ] Talk to us , Al . Just talk to us . We can fix this . We can find her . We can find Celia . We can protect her . Anything you need , we can find a way to make it happen , son . - [ Mark ] Come on , Al . - It can happen anytime , anywhere . I don 't even know how it happens . Al , listen to me . You 're alive six months from now . You saw it ! - Man , you saw it ! - But if I 'm not here ... - [ Demetri ] Come on . Get down . - If I 'm not here that means we can change things . - Al , please , get down . What I saw ... I killed her . ... what you saw doesn 't have to play out that way . - Al , what are you talking about ? - I found a way to change the game . [ Man ] Al , listen to me . Celia 's death was an accident , OK ? A terrible , random accident . There 's nothing you could 've done to avoid this . Nothing . - [ Thudding ] - [ Demetri ] Al ! Al ! - [ All shouting ] - [ Wedeck ] No ! - [ Demetri panting ] - [ Down-tempo piano music plays ] [ Demetri ] " Dear Celia . I don 't know your last name and I don 't know where you live . But I know you have two young boys . Twins , I believe . And I know you didn 't have a flash forward . I understand how terrifying that is and how powerless you must be feeling . But I want you to know that you are not alone , and that your situation is not as hopeless as you think . Our paths were meant to cross . I didn 't know how . I didn 't know when . But things have changed now . Things are no longer going to unfold as I had feared . My gift to you is release from that dread from the feeling that you 're no longer in control . We will never meet . I will never know you . So live your life . Live every day . And know that the future is unwritten . Make the most of that . " [ Inhales deeply ] Hi , Dad .

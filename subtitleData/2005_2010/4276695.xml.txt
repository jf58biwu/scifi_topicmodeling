Together , they fight to stop Skynet from ever being created . The battle for our tomorrow starts today . Episode 201 : Samson Delilah v 1.00 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ... Do we have a John Reese ? Come if you want to live . You want to stop Skynet ? This is the way . Cromartie came through . He knows we 're here . We 're programmed to repair ourselves ' . We 're programmed to blend in . - There are other people here ? - Resistance fighters . Humans sent back from the future by John . The machine 's gotta go . Don 't let yourself think that you can train them like a pet , because it 'll be the last thing that you think . Your fiancee , Sarah Connor , killed a man because she believes in the future , he 'll invent a computer system that declares war on the world . My Turk plays chess at a level that could defeat every human player that has ever lived and probably ever will live . Tech Industry spent billions doubling chip power . That 's how we can go from a chess computer to the apocalypse . The Turk created Skynet . Somebody killed him and took the machine . He was dead and the Turk was gone . Got a good idea who has it . Sarkissian . Check the office . See if he stashed the Turk . Sarkissian 's hard drive . If you die , they win . Agent Ellison . Can I borrow you ? Pulled him from the apartment . It 's your guy , right ? The shooter ? Yeah , that 's him . How does a mope like that take out 20 of our HRT ? Zach wants you back home for a full incident report . You need a ride ? I can get a junior agent to drive your car . Come on . They gonna believe a mope like this took out 20 of your HRT ? And believe a machine from the future stole his identity and did it ? They gotta believe . This has to end here . Sorry you gotta take the blame for it . It 's not your fault . Just bad luck . You all right ? John , are you all right ? Would you answer me ? Mom ! Can you move ? Are you hurt ? You 're bleeding . - I 'm fine . Are you all right ? - Just my shoulder . We gotta go . - Can you walk ? - Yeah . Good , ' cause we gotta run . Come back here ! All fire and EMT Personnel advised to stand by . Fire has destroyed a home at 204 Laurel Avenue . Number of dead or injured is unknown . - These the only two DOA ? - That 's it . - You check the whole house ? - House is clear . What the hell 's going on here ? Where is she ? Hell if I know . Long gone if I know her . - Who 's out there under those sheets ? - We were doing a deal . Went bad . We stole this . Guess they came back for it . - What 's on it ? - Records , names , transactions . I don 't know . We thought we could use it . - What are you looking for ? - It 's a piece of tech . It 's called the Turk . It 's another computer . It 's a program . - What 's it do ? - Right now ? Plays a mean game of chess . Couple years , it 's gonna get really pissed off . Blow up the world . Units requested . Possible stolen vehicle involved in an accident . Suspects fled scene . Injuries unknown . - She could be anywhere . - That 's right , she could be anywhere . Or she could be right there . Maybe with your chess program . The identification of these two victims has not yet been released . And it is unclear how they are connected to this blaze or to the car explosion nearby . Mr. Walsh ? - Ma 'am . - Do you have it ? I do , Ma 'am . It 's a modest little mouse , if I may say . It 's not much to look at for 300,000 . Better be able to checkmate Bobby Fischer for that . Not for you to judge , Mr. Walsh . - It 's the last you 'll hear of it . - When will I see you ? I thought I 'd tour the sights with it for a bit , Ma 'am . - Make sure I was clean . - That seems prudent . An hour , then . An hour . And Mr. Walsh , Bobby Fischer 's dead . Yes ? Call a meeting of the department heads for tonight . Tonight ? But Ms. Weaver , Justin Tuck is in Palm Springs for a long weekend . - I 'll get him back . - Thank you . Witness saw a woman and a teenage boy get out of the car and move off to the south . - Are they hurt ? - Either way , they 're moving . I 'm okay . It 's just bruised . Let 's go . It could be broken . How 's your leg ? Is your head still bleeding ? We 've gotta get off the street . We need to find a safe place . Has there been an accident ? We need sanctuary . Can I ask for that ? Please ? We need somewhere to hide . Now . Yes . Of course . Come with me . And they should leave . Come on . - What will you do when you find ' em ? - Do ? Join the team ? Think she 's gonna go with you , 'cause it 's not gonna happen . She left you at the altar for a reason . - That 's not what I want . - Really . - Yeah . I 'm married . - So you say . - I love my wife . - So you say . Look , I just wanna know they 're okay , got it ? - What if they 're not ? - Then I 'll make ' em okay . Like I did for you . Your money 'll be deposited in the account within 30 minutes . Please , take all the precautions we discussed . Of course , Ma 'am . So much for so little . Again , don 't mind me sayin ' . They flow from street to street . At a particular speed and in a particular direction . Walk the block , wait for the signal , cross at the light . Over and over . So orderly . All day I can watch them and know with a great deal of certainty what they 'll do at any given moment . But they 're not orderly , are they ? Up close . Any individual . Who knows what they 're gonna do ? Any one of them might dash across the street at the wrong time and get hit by a car . When you get up close , we never follow the rules . You give a computer a series of rules , and it will follow them till those rules are superseded by other rules . Or that computer simply ... wears down and quits . Computers are obedient to a fault . Do you know what 's extremely rare in the world of computers ? Finding one ... that 'll cross against the light . Thank you , Mr. Walsh . Be careful out there . Are you all right ? - You already asked me that . - I 'm asking you again . I 'm fine . I think we need to talk about what happened back at the house . - No , I don 't . - Maybe I need to talk about it . Maybe you do , but I don 't , so let 's not . Please . Then we need to talk about her . Whatever happened with the explosion , it 's flipped a switch . She 's reverted or something . She knows everything . I know . Bank accounts . Contingency plans . Weapons stash . - I know . - How we run , where we 'll go . Who we 've been , who we 'll be . She 's ... stronger and faster . - We have to kill her , John . - I know ! I know . I just read your incident report . I wanna thank you for filling everything out so quickly ... It 's a big help . Of course . So , Laszlo ... Did you ever think that he had it in him ? Out-of-work actor , a civilian ? I did not , no . But he was here before . Suspect in multiple murders . - We cleared him . - But you had a change of heart ? I discovered he was impersonating an FBI agent . Yeah , I had a change of heart . Do you have any idea whose bullet was ultimately responsible for taking Laszlo out ? No , I don 't . You know who threw the tear gas into the residence ? And who fired into the apartment , igniting the canisters ? - No , I do not . - It 's amazing you survived . Do you know how you survived ? You wanna talk to somebody ? You need help ? You want a counselor ? A pastor ? You 're divorced . You have anybody ? I 'll be all right . Take six weeks paid leave , special circumstances . - I don 't think that will be necessary . - We insist on it . So under possible penalty of perjury , as it relates to case file B1987004 , do you , Agent James Ellison , today attest that all that you 've recorded and said , case file 's accurate and factual as far as your recollection can warrant ? Yes . I do . Good luck , Agent . Yes ? May I help you ? I 'm looking for my family . - Family ? - My mother and my brother . We were in an accident . I think they 're hurt . There is no one here . I need to find them . It 's life or death . Like I said , there is no one here . I 'm going to look around . It 's life or death . Now . - Two minutes . - I know . - What are you doing ? - Stay away . Please . I told you to go away . You have to stay away . Go ! 70 seconds . - The knife isn 't sharp enough . - Well , push harder . - How much time ? - 55 . Wait , I see it . Screwdriver , screwdriver . - 35 . - Oh , it 's not the right size . 20 seconds . Okay , okay . The knife , the knife . - Damn it ! - We can 't do this . - Come on . - She 's waking up . She 's waking up ! Keys . You have to go . Do it . - What ? - Go . Move ! Call to him . Call to him . - You 're making this difficult . - He won 't come back ! No . He won 't . You can 't do this . You don 't know what you 're about to do . Yes , I do . You 're gonna kill me . No , John . You can 't do this . You 're not doing the right thing . This is not the right thing , John . Things are good now . Things are fine now . I ran a test . Things are good now . I 'm fixed now . You can trust me now . - What are you waiting for ? - She doesn 't know , she doesn 't . I 'm good now . I 'm good , I ran a test . Everything 's perfect . I 'm perfect . I 'm sorry for what I did . It wasn 't me . You have to understand . It wasn 't me . That wasn 't me . You can 't let this happen , John . You can 't ! Please , listen to me . Listen to me . I don 't wanna go . Please , John , please . John , listen to me . I don 't wanna go . Please , John . Please . I 'm good now . Listen to me . I don 't want to go . I 'm sorry . That wasn 't me . I 'm fixed now . I ran a test . Everything 's perfect . You can trust me . I love you ! I love you , please . I love you , John , and you love me . We should get going soon . You guys cut a pretty serious path of destruction across the city . Wasn 't us . - I 'm sorry . - Shoulda called earlier ... - We could 've helped you avoid some . - I doubt it . How 's this ? It looks trashed . So I 'm guessing Sarkissian didn 't tell you where he sold the Turk . Wasn 't that kind of conversation . Did he see it all ? He saw it all . Damn . So Charlie told me that Cromartie killed about 20 FBI guys today . He 's still out there . He 's here for me . They 're dead because of me . They 're dead because some people refuse to accept the reality of the situation . Which is what ? Which is that they carry death with them . She was different . - No . - I made her . I sent her back . - She 's different . - She 's not different . There 's physical damage to her chip . Which means that she can be repaired ... I need her . She saved my life . She saves my life ! I know what you saw today . I know what you did , and I 'm ... so proud of you . Maybe you could fix her . I know you wanna try . But I can 't let you . I just ... I can 't . So burn her . Let 's get the hell outta here . What she said back there ... Everything she said , it was a trick . You know that , right ? They don 't feel anything . They don 't have feelings . They don 't know love . I know that , Mom . You know , I saw her do this with the last one . The only way to be sure . Especially this one . John , chip . The flare . Where is it ? I 'm sorry . John . Don 't do this . - Don 't do this ! - Back off ! - John , she 'll kill you . - There 's only one way to find out . Are you here to kill me , John ? Are you here to kill me ? No . Promise . Promise . I 'll never lead you to her . So if that 's why you left me alive , you might as well kill me right now . I 'll never do the Devil 's work . We 'll see . Thank you for joining me tonight . I 'm pleased to announce the formation of a new division . It 'll cross disciplines , draw from many areas of expertise , and require the highest level of work from each of your groups . Each of our groups ? How 's that ? Won 't you be hiring ... I 'll be taking team members from each division - and creating a new team . - With all due respect , and I can only speak on behalf of the AI division when I tell you that I haven 't a man to spare . Your division will be hard-hit . A list of new team members will be on your desks after you leave . The name of the new group is Babylon . - It 's from the Bible . - And what does Babylon do ? I mean , besides steal our team members . Mr. Tuck , it 's going to change the world . I got what I could . Some smoke and water damage , but you don 't have to start over . It wouldn 't be the first time . Thanks . There 's one too many . Charley took off . He said to say bye . Guess he really does have a wife . Have you seen John ? I think he 's using the shower . Do you believe in the Resurrection ? What ? The story of Jesus Christ . The Resurrection . Do you believe in it ? Would you if you 'd seen what I 've seen ? Faith isn 't part of my programming . Yeah , well , I 'm not sure it 's part of mine either . Don 't let him do that again . If I ever go bad again ... don 't let him bring me back . I made you a sandwich and brought you some clothes . I 'll be out soon . John , I need you to know everything that happened today . Everything we did . It was all ... It just happened the way it did . And there 's nothing we can do to change it . Whatever happened , we 're alive . Okay ? We 're alive . I know you need more from me today , but ... It 's gonna have to be enough . Can you hear me ? Are you listening ? Yeah , I 'm listening . Happy birthday . That was something , wasn 't it ? Wonder what she 's got planned . Who knows what goes on in that brain of hers ? I don 't know understand what the hell she 's talking about anyway . Zen koans and Bible quotes . It 's all a bunch of bull . Our options have tripled since she took over , so I wouldn 't bite the hand if I were you . Well , that 's easy for you to say . She 's not cannibalizing your division for some top secret Torah study . God , that bitch pisses me off . Sorry I piss you off , Mr. Tuck . The feeling 's mutual .

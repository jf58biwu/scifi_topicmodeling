 Previously on V ... They 're calling themselves " the visitors " the visitors didn 't just get here . They 've been here for years . my partner Dale was one of them . Anyone could be a visitor . At least we have this- - everyone who 's ever contacted the FBI about aliens or visitors . maybe we can find other people who wanna fight . Whateverhey 're gonna do to the humans , it 's nothing Compared to what they 'll do to traitors like me and you . That 's weird. picture 's upside down. who 's cyrus ? A guy i used to know . - what , you always make your girlfriend do the talkin ' ? Tyler . The counsel wants to kick you out of the ambassador program . I can and do influence public opinion dale is a traitor . i don 't think he 'll show his face again . it 's a bright new day in america , a day of high emotions as we open our doors to a nation Not just from beyond our borders , But from beyond our imaginations . After weeks of heated debate and speculation About the government 's decision , Today the US granted the V 's diplomatic relations . Though the day is not without controversy . demonstrators have gathered outside the peace ambassador center Protesting the decision to grant visas the the visitors . But nothing can take away from the excitement here As Anna becomes the first visitor To step through the new york gate beside me , Leading the way for many more to follow her onto american soil in the days to come . This is chad decker reporting live From the New York peace ambassador center . that 's good . You know ... You helped make this day happen . Yeah . I guess i did . bless me , father , for I have sinned . It 's been two weeks since my last confession . I 've been doubting god . Are the V 's demons or angels ? is everything I believed a lie ? if only god dgave us a sign ? my little baby sister has cancer . The V 's cured her . Who am I to question the pope ? I never believed in miracles before , father ... but now I do . What are we supposed to do ? I 'm just so scared . Does God even really exist ? must I feel so weak ? forgive these impure thoughts . Feel ... Lost . the government plans to expand its welcome to the V 's in the weeks to come . this is just the first wave of diplomat issued to the visitors . once on the ground , they will be afforded all America has to offer in return for what everyone hopes will be a prosperous exchange ... there is no way that we had time to do a proper threat assessment . It 's like 9 / 11 never happened . wow. must be hard thinking everyone 's a terrorist . Hey , i don 't want you going into the city today . - I 'll be fine . It 's gonna be crazy with all the v stuff . Yeah , but I was just gonna give brandon a lift . Okay . Uh , come home right after . Mom , there 's a priest at the door . Hi. i 'm jack. i- - We work together . oh , that 's cute . Go . What are you doing here , Jack ? you okay ? I want to be useful . I want to be able to look people in the eye and say , " god loves you , and everything 's gonna be fine . " How do i tell them that ? I don 't even know what to tell myself anymore . i know how you feel . Why are the v 's doing it like this ? Why the infiltration ? why the sleeper cells ? Why don 't they just annihilate us and get it over with ? Because they 're smart and patient . And whatever their plan is , They need us for something . And until we figure out what that is , we have to fight them The same way they 're fighting us--one step at a time . I haven 't been able to sleep , so i was up most of the night Going through this list , Trying to find anyone who was at the warehouse with us . Whenever i find anything that might be V-related , I plug it into the fbi database . any luck ? I 've narrowed it down to a couple hundred . good . Evans . Yeah . no , i 'll be right there . I have to go to the peace ambassador center . There 's been a death threat against the v 's . You 're going to protect the v 's ? Yeah . Well , if a human ... kills a visitor , That makes us the bad guys . yeah , and they 'll be the good guys . You 're right. that 's all we need . if i have to be on their side , Maybe there 's something i can find that will help us fight . all right. uh , you know what ? Well , if you don 't mind , i-i-i can stay here . I can keep going through the list . Maybe i 'll find a match . yeah. okay. that would be great . Okay . um , you can cross-reference with--with the files . I 'll call you later . Be careful . You be careful today . You all right ? you look worried . What , i can 't walk you to work ? when have you ever walked me to work ? It 's just that everything 's crazy now . Visitors walking around the city , angry protesters are pissed off . Well , whatever the reason , it 's nice . Look , don 't worry . People fear change . it 's normal . The v 's are friendly , And the protesters are gonna realize that eventually . What ? You have this look , like you 're keeping a secret or something . Sweetheart , i would never wanna keep any secrets from you . I love you . I love you . Georgie , thanks for meeting me . Yeah. well , you saved my life at the warehouse . It 's the least i can do . How many others survived at that warehouse besides us ? I don 't know. i haven 't tried to contact them since the ambush . Look , i 'm scared . We don 't know who to trust anymore . With the v 's being granted those visas , It 's only gonna get worse . We need to mount a resistance Before they infiltrate any further . How ? We don 't have access to cash , bodies . I 've got access to both . You ever heard of John May ? The guy 's a myth . No , he 's not a myth . He 's real . John May is the leader of the fifth column . First group of visitors to ever turn against the leadership- - He started it . the visitors have sleeper cells everywhere . Yeah , and so do we . The fifth column is down , but it 's not out . We can win this . And if John May gets into this ... He 'll bring an army . He 's regained consciousness ? Yes , but there was a lot of damage . We 're still unsure if he 's going to remember anything . He has to . He was a highly placed sleeper for almost 20 years . We have to know if he was compromised , and if so , by whom . I understand . You 're awake . I 'm Joshua . You gave us quite a scare . what ? You 're on the new york mother ship . We don 't usually get guys like you up here . It 's kind of a big deal , actually. you 're a real hero . Yeah ? What 'd i do ? you were stabbed . Whoever did it was going for your heart . If you were human , they would 've killed you . Joke 's on them , right ? You were left for dead . Posttraumatic amnesia . It might take a while before it all comes back . I need you to help me remember who did this to me . V - 01x03 - A Bright New Day at the center of the growing protest movement against the v 's is a woman named Mary Falkner . mrs . Falkner , the widow of lieutenant David Falkner , whose f-16 fighter jet went down the day the V 's arrived , has been on a hunger strike for six days . she has gathered quite a following , and she had this to say yesterday ... they say the v 's medical cures can save lives . but how does that make up for the death of my husband ? or the 642 other souls around the world who were killed that day in accidents caused by their arrival ? The FBIare on their way . this Falkner widow is gonna speak live on national television ... Outside our building . I heard . It 's planned for later today . She 's becoming the face of the protest movement . Give me as much information on Mary Falkner as you can . I wanna know everything about her- - Her dead husband , her child , her family . we have to stop this now . I feel like this is all my fault , man . If you hadn 't punched that dude in front of Lisa , you 'd be going in there with me right now . I know I screwed up this whole peace ambassador thing , But , uh , I 'll find a way to make it right . Well , maybe Lisa could talk to somebody . I don 't want to get her in any more trouble . We 've had multiple calls from this guy . Profiled as mid to late 20 's , white male , mentally unstable . Ex-military ? he knows his weapons Based on those last calls , he 's not just blowin ' off steam . This guy 's got a plan . This is a volatile situation . Last thing we need is a panicked mob Or anything that might provoke that shooter to open fire , Which is we 'll be coordinating with v security . We 'll have to keep a low profile and work together . Each FBI agent will be partnered with a V. I don 't need a partner . It 's not up to you , Evans . Agent Evans , I have been assigned to you . I hope that won 't be a problem . No , it 's fine . I understand your reluctance . Your species is naturally mistrusting . First thing I 'm going to need is access to your surveillance center . That 's in our restricted zone . I know . This is your surveillance for the whole center ? Your government gave us this building when we got here . We didn 't really have time to change anything . We need to adjust these two cameras in the north courtyard . There 's a blind spot between them . Our shooter is not gonna stand out . he 'll try to appear casual . Look for baseball hats , hands in pockets- - Anyone whose agenda does not fit their surroundings . There is one thing . If there are injuries , we 'd like assurances that our people will be treated by our own medical staff . No offense intended . no , I completely understand . you ready to go ? Yeah . Let 's go . George . George . George Sutton . It 's Erica . Leave a message . Erica , it 's me . I think we just got our first break . You know the guy--the guy who led the warehouse meeting ? I think I found him . So what do you want from me ? We gotta find others who will help . Who 's Cyrus ? An old friend . A fifth column member . We fought together before I met you . I 'm on my way to see him now . and you think he 's gonna help ? He was my right hand. the way he used to fight those v 's ... We 'd say he had a death wish . Ah , still , that 's one guy . We 're gonna need a lot more than that . Nobody had better contacts in the column than he did . Why don 't you come with me ? No . No , it 's gonna be a while before i recruit again . I gotta do this , georgie . Someone 's gotta put the column back together . Strength in numbers . we 're closed for remodeling ! Can 't you read the sign ? ! You always were a rude bastard , cyrus . Ryan . What the hell are you doing here , man ? I 'll give you 29 guesses . let the record show that the captains of all 29 ships Are present for the briefing . Today a historic day . Though we continue to gain ground in diplomatic areas , We must not underestimate the importance of popular opinion Among humanity . Opinions can easily change . Monitor them , and if necessary , Shape those opinions within your territories . By doing so , We can stop any resistance before it starts . Go forward . What do you know about what happened ? You were taking out a human resistance group . You sent out a distress signal . Recove team picked you up at a warehouse . You were the only v that survived . How bad was this ? When they brought you in , you were wide-open . So whoever did this saw my true face . I 've uploaded a complete dossier on mary falkner to your console . Thank you . You 're wondering why i 'm so focused on a single woman When we have so many global concerns . That had crossed my mind , yes . Mary falkner 's life is in ruins , and she blames us . That kind of hatred is contagious . We have to make an example of her so that she doesn 't infect others . Hello ? George ? mr. sutton ? What are you doing in here ? I 'm sorry . I , uh ... I didn 't think anyone was ... I 'm , uh , looking for George Sutton . He doesn 't live here anymore . One does . Do you know how to contact him ? Is this because of the murders ? Are you counseling him or something ? Sorry , the what ? His family- - they were all killed . they 've been implementing a plan that will result in the extermination of every man , woman and child on the face of this earth . He went a little crazy after that . He said aliens did it . Look , it 's--it 's , uh , it 's really important that i speak with him . If you have any way of contacting him , would you , please ? - Priests got cards now ? - Yeah . You can tell him i was at the warehouse . He 'll know what that means . It 's not like it was . most everybody 's scattered to the wind . Yeah , but you 're still in touch with some of the best , right ? Yeah , we had a hell of a crew . Well , you did the hard part , I 'm kinda hoping you 'd be the first to enlist . Gotta get the column back together . I got some names and numbers in the back . Best I can do right now . Okay . Grab my glasses off that table , would you ? What the hell you doin ' , Cyrus ? You don 't know what it 's been like . I gotta turn you over to them now . They 're on their way . What 'd they promise you ? They told me they 'd reconnect me ... If I turned in enough fifth column . How many did you turn in ? Does it matter ? - all I need is one more . - They 're not gonna reconnect you , cyrus ! They 're gonna get as many fifth column out of you As they can , and then they 're gonna skin you alive . that 's what they 're gonna do ! no , they 're gonna help me . they have to help me . Don 't you miss it ? Everything anna gave to us- - don 't you miss the bliss ? The bliss ? The bliss is how she controlled us , Cyrus . Just like junkies , man . And that 's what you are . You 're nothing but a junkie , Just like the rest of ' em . they promised me . I 'll be reconnected . They promised me ! You gotta be alive to be reconnected . This is the best vantage point on the property ? You tell me . There 's a guard missing , corner of the building . He stole a v jacket . The shooter is wearing a v jacket . Get medical assistance now ! Our shooter is wearing a v uniform . That 's him . I think I just spotted our shooter . what 's going on ? he 's headed into the building . What 's your 20 on him ? he 's in the building . The suspect , white male , brown hair . Cover the room , go . Control the elevator . Understood . All agens , spread out . Suspect last seen inside the building . What 's your 20 on him ? he 's in the building . Gun ! everybody down ! Aah ! stay down ! Aah ! stay down ! The v 's are a plague ? don 't you get it ? yeah , i get it . get up . We have a holding room this way . from the little we know about the incident , there were no casualties as a result of the attack . we 're still trying to get word on whether the shooting was directly connected to the visitors receiving their visas today . we 'll update you with more information as we get it . reporting live from the peace ambassador center , i 'm chad decker for wnt news . dude , did you set this up ? Catch you later . Hi . Hey . Got your visa today , huh ? Yeah . So what do you think of new york ? Still getting the hang of this whole earth thing , you know ? yeah , me , too .

Your quick action saved my life . I blame instinct and training . Nonetheless , it 's deeply appreciated . Anything else i can ever do , please don 't hesitate . And vice versa . Where are we ? I made this construct based on your neural scans . Sometimes familiar places can bring up memories . Do you recognize anything ? I worked here . My desk was right over ... I can 't believe you lived with another species all those years . That must 've been amazing . If by " amazing " you mean smelly , crowded and disgusting ? And dangerous- - All that undercover work you did ? Well ... It wasn 't like i was the only v at the bureau . Hey , i just remembered that . Good . That 's a good sign . If you can remember your life , Then what happened on that night is going to come back to you . You have no idea how disgusting it was To wake up next to a human every morning . My wife erica used to brush her hair in the kitchen . Who does that ? I believe your wife 's name was joselyn . Erica was your partner here at the fbi . Right . Erica ... Erica cracked my head open . She saw my true face . she knows . We gotta go . - Where are we going ? - You gotta send me back down . I 'm going to kill her . Heard you were looking for me . you were at the warehouse . Turn around . I brought the photos . Yeahyou were with the blonde- - the mouthy one . Her name 's erica , and ... she 's an fbi agent .

What do you want from me ? We 're trying to find anyone who survived . We need to stick together . Every time we try to come together , They crush us . And f.y.i. , leaving your card with people will get you killed . I saw the pictures at your house . Your family--it was the v 's , wasn 't it ? The Vs were responsible for their deaths . - that 's none of your business . - I don 't know you , And i don 't know what you 've been through , but if you 're anything like me , this whole- - this whole thing has made you feel alone . Lost . There 's strength in numbers . We need to stick together , george . It 's georgie . Georgie . You 're sure erica was the only one who saw you ? Sure . And she was meeting with other human resistance members . She 's not even gonna know what hit her . You 're right , because i 'm not letting you go back down . Come again ?

This is chad decker Reporting live from the new york peace ambassador center Where mary falkner , the voice of the anti-v movement , Is approaching the podium . i began this day As i have every day since i lost my husband- - The same way that every family member who lost a loved one On the day the visitors arrived- - With an unbearable emptiness . And , like most of you , With an anger towards those responsible for our loss . But something changed for me- - Something i-i never expected . I had a quiet conversation with someone who not only eased my suffering , but ... Who helped me understand that ... my husband did not die in vain , Someone that reminded me that only hope and trust can heal us , And that what we share with those we feared Is far greater that anything that divides us- - Anna . today , A man possessed by hate Tried to kill one of my people . But this real target ... was peace- - The same peace lieutenant falkner gave his life To defend . We will not diminish this brave soldier 's sacrifice By answering in kind . We remain of peace ... Always . Show me . by the time we got here , it was too late . who would 've done this ? There will be no peace . This is , uh , my room . It 's nice You don 't really care much about my room , do ya ? hey , ty ? I 'm so sorry. i ... My mom doesn 't like the v 's . I can 't let her see me like this .

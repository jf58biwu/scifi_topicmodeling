 Tin Man Season 1 Episode 2 Mother ? I missed you . I don 't even know you . Your light is strong . Let it guide you through your memories . I 'm a waitress , and a part-time student . I don 't think I can do this . I 'm scared . When you were a girl , I used to rock you at our special place . Remember . DG , breakfast ! Wind last night made a real mess a things . Branches took out a transformer . Well , you better fix it before it fixes us . Come on , woman , I can 't work on an empty tank . Besides , I need our expert on this one , if she ever wakes up . Morning , sleepyhead . All right ... Was I asleep ? Dead to the world for 14 hours . Figured you must 've had something on your mind . Lord knows I have . I was wrong , DG . You have a right to your own life . I had no business looking through your stuff last night . That was last night ? Had that crazy nightmare again , huh ? In technicolor . Well , you 're awake now so you better help your dad before he wrecks this place . But , the farm was wrecked . Mercy me . Have you been having those chili cheese fries before bed again ? But your stories must have worked their way into my subconscious , because there was a frozen lake and a palace , and my mother was a queen , and she was trying to get me to remember this thing about an emerald , so I could stop my evil sister . Well , did you ? Remember , I mean ? No , and when I didn 't , she sicked these monkey-bats on me . Well , you got the storm part right , baby girl . We got a heck of a mess to clean up . That 's the cold hard reality . Finally talking some sense . Heck with that . You know I 'd pick a good story over work any day . I 'd rather hear the big secret about that emerald the queen whispered into your ear . Aw , Popsicle , I can 't remember . It was something ... What something , honey ? I never said she whispered anything into my ear . Sorry , baby girl , guess I blew it . It 's okay , Popsicle . I know you tried your best . That was all fake ? You are twisted . Why ? Because with a little re-wiring , I 've gotten something I 've missed out on for too long ? A father 's love , a mother 's affection . Where are my real parents . Our parents ? Well , daddy , the thief , abandoned us after you ... Died . Mother never forgave him for that . Had his name officially banished from the lands . Ever the drama queen . Where is she ? There came a time when she had to be ... Isolated . Mother ? DG , where are you ? Let her go . That can be arranged , but first you have to do something for me . Fear not , my child , there is one thing that can stop her . The emerald of the eclipse . The secret to finding it now lives inside of you . When the time is right , you will return . DG , just ... Tell me where the emerald is . Just tell me what she whispered to you , and I will take you to her . I promise . I don 't remember . That was a long time ago . We can pry those memories out of her . Zero , she 's my sister . I guess I haven 't really made this much of a family reunion , have I ? Well , I wasn 't expecting a picnic . I want to show you something , share something with you . " the majestic queen of the O.Z. had two lovely daughters , she . " " double eclipse it is foreseen , light meets dark in the stillness between , " " but only one and one alone , shall hold the emerald and take the throne . " So , what is that ? The great and ominous prophecy of the O.Z. It 's a nursery rhyme . A few couplets that roll pleasingly off the tongue . It 's not who we are , DG . You tried to kill me . I was just a child you know , i ... I foolishly believed the part about " only one and one alone . " and you don 't now ? No . I believe that the prophecy can be what you and I make of it . DG , we were such good friends . We spent hours imaging what the O.Z. Would be like when we grew up . Please , you must remember that . We were friends ? We 'd explore the woods , gather apples , skip little stones across the lake . We made mother crazy with worry . Apples ? No . I 'm not buying what you 're doing with this whole " keys to the kingdom " crap . I 'm not doing anything . I just want what the prophecy can bring to both of us . It 's our birthright . It 's our chance to make a new O.Z. Just tell me where it is . I don 't rember . DG ... My lovely little sister . That was the wrong ... Answer . Now we do it your way . I 'll take her for a reading with lylo . If you rember nothing else , remember this . The next time I snuff out your insignificant little life , there 'll be no one standing by to save you . Raw ? Cain ... Now it 's dinner for three . Lylo ... No ! He 's not one of us anymore . No iron suit for you this time . No wife and child crying for years to free you from it . My family 's alive ? My family 's alive ? My family 's alive ? You been sleeping for hours like a ... Like a baby with his pacifier . I thought you were dead . Ditto . You know , I may have saved you from hypothermia , but ... This is what saved your life . It stopped the bullet . DG ... Azkadellia . Raw ? I don 't know , I can 't find him . Either they took him , too , or ... - He 's dead , or- - - Maybe he ran away . You know , you really should do something about that bitter cynicism of yours , Cain . Why ? Someone 's got to keep your wide-eyed optimism in check . Hey , Glitch ... What ? I owe you one . You know , Cain , professional psychiatric therapy is only a crow 's call away these days . I think a man like you with your issues of masculinity , and the ... Well , we call it the " boy scout syndrome ... " No ... Leave him alone ! No ... No ! No ... No ! Stop ! Stop ! A whisper , Lylo . All I 'm looking for is a secret whispered to a little girl ! Lylo can 't find . - Focus ! - Something protecting her memories ! Break through . Now ! Lylo is trying ! Don 't try ! Do ! How can he rember , if I can 't ? What did mother whisper into DG 's ear about the emerald ? Emerald ... Only thing can stop Azkadellia . Focus , lylo ! Where is it ? All is gray ! Emerald within the gray gale . Gray gale ? What is the gray gale ? Don 't know . Can 't see . Where is it ? Hurts to reach into her memories . Memories surrounded by ... Magic . Lylo ! Magic ? I don 't have to guess who 's responsible for that , do I ? Mother ... More secrets ? You 've cloaked DG 's memories with your magic . You 're the one who forced secrets into our lives . Well , you did your work a little too well . All traces of the gray gale are gone . She 'll never remember now . Are you surprised I know about the gray gale ? What do you know ? Learn to love me , mother . Learn to trust me , and I will give you back your throne . Put the crown upon your head , and kneel at your feet . The loyal daughter you always dreamed of . You 're not my daughter . You 're ... How could you say such a thing ? - You made me who I am . - No . Tell me where the emerald is . Not while there 's still a breath in my body . Raw sorry ... Raw run away . Raw scared . We all scared . Don 't let them do this to Kalm . He needs us . Needs you . Sleep . This one will read the girl next . Take him to the gilded hall for initialization . No ! Oh , please ... Try again . Lylo ... Lylo ? Raw ? What are you looking at ? I have a theory which can 't be unproven . Mystic man ? You 're alive ! It is called ... The " or not " theory . Oh , I have so much to tell you . Ah , ah , ah ... You know that they wouldn 't put you in a cell near mine unless they wanted to hear us talk . She 's . She 's listening ? First , you must journey to the north , or not . Yes , I journeyed to the north . I went to the ice palace , and I know who my mother is . Are you sure you 're not still on the vapors ? I 've never been clearer in my whole life . It 's all coming back to me . My troubled childhood , a rich life of scholarly pursuit , my brief but glamorous life in show business , although that part is a little bit hazy . Did you feel that ? Yeah . They 're testing a machine . What sort of machine ? The complete destruction of the O.Z. Is that why she needs the emerald ? O ... Kay . What are we going to do ? There is so much I would like to tell you , but . Azkadellia 's eyes and ears are all over us now . Okay . Tell me what you know about the ... The gray gale is a myth ... Dreamt up by the ancients to entertain their children . Time to change tack . Long time no see . Azkadellia ? A little older , a lot smarter , and most definitely still in charge . Nothing like a violent coup to win the hearts and minds of a kingdom . Good . You still have a memory . It may be the one thing that can save you . What do you want ? What I want is the very thing you 've devoted your feeble life to . Magic , my friend . Those who can 't do , teach . Remember ? Your freedom for your help . My help ? I mean , I 'm not saying they called me twinkle toes , or anything , but I cut quite a rug . Oh , you can make a face , cain , but it 's true . There was a time when I was a fantastic dancer . She may have taken my brains , but rhythm ! That comes directly from your- - do you have any bright ideas how to get in there ? I mean , I don 't mind taxing my half brain for DG , but just once I wish that someone would acknowledge me for my rhythm , which as I was trying to say before I was so rudely interrupted , comes directly from the soul . Sometimes , Cain , you make me feel just like those ladies at the dance did , like I blend right into the wallpaper . That 's a good idea . You want to dance ? I 'll lead , you follow . What I can tell you is that your mother cloaked your memories in magic , so that Azkadellia cannot get to them . Great . The only thing is , neither can I. Yes , you can . You know what , my mother was really good with the " to-do " list , she just wasn 't so good with the " how-to-do " lists . She said you must unlock your memories . Your light must brighten a place that is dark . In the south . It 's where you 'll find a message about your future and your past . Fiery , aren 't they ? Never seen ' em that large . Left , left ! Left , right , left ! Left , left ! Left , right , left ! You 're a deep well , Glitch . It 's all about rhythm . Come on , let 's go . So eager to please the wrong sister . Azkadellia ... As I live and breathe . So far . I don 't know which is more pathetic , you on the vapors or off . Your sister is more powerful than you . She will never ... be as powerful as me . Then why are you so scared ? I know you ... Witch . What do you know ? Stop , Az ! Stop it ! Unlock your memories . Not so great and terrible after all , huh ? Hey ! Do I know you ? Hey ... Thanks . My friend 's this way . DG ? DG ! Raw ! Are you okay ? Let 's get you out of here . Longcoats . That could bust a zipper . Glitch ... Hey there , princess . Cain , you 're alive ! Barely . Furry lips here really packs a punch . We 've got to get out of here . Well , we can 't get out the way we came in . This way . Come on . DG ! Which way ? Which way ? You 're taking directions from a dog . Left or left ? I 've got them , sir ! Longcoats ! I think he wants us to go in there . I think we 'd better hurry . Let 's go . You 're a good boy ! You knew the way ! It 's okay . It 's okay , I 'm a friend , I 'm a friend of your mother 's . She sent me to help . We 'd better go . We 've got an emerald to find . Good , good . Are you ready , kid ? Yeah . That machine that we escaped through ? The mystic man said that she was going to use that to destroy the O.Z. Wait a second . You saw the mystic man ? He 's dead . She killed him . He said that she needs the emerald to make the machine work . That 's interesting . How ? Folks ... I suggest we keep moving . Sorry , pooch , but this is where we part company . Part ? With the longcoats on our trail and the mobats in the sky , I don 't have time to figure out what your angle is in all of this . My angle is her mother sent me to help . And you did . I 'd even thank you for what you did back there if I knew who you were , or what . Whoa . Mr. Suspicious , this is the man ... Dog ... Thingie ... who helped us escape ! - Shape-shifter . - Yes . Yes , Mr. Raw . He knew your name . How did you know his name ? I know all of your names . You 're Mr. Glitch , former advisor to the queen herself , Mr. Raw , a viewer of extraordinary skill , and you , Mr. Cain you were a tin man on the mystic man 's protection detail . You 're all quite famous in the O.Z. And quite in demand . Dead or alive . That is a terrible picture of me . Mmm ... Now , look , I 'm sorry if I scared any of you back there , but there 's never really a great time for the old beast-into-man moment . You just ... Wham ! And hope for the best . I don 't know . You 're still a stranger . Am I ? Let 's just see about that . Hey , that 's mine . It was yours when you were a child . Whoa . Am I really doing this ? Indeed you are . Magic 's in your blood . Let it shed light on your past so that you may better face your future . Now , concentrate , DG . Concentrate . Concentrate , DG . You must let the light flow through you effortlessly . Remember , light as air . To ... It 's tutor . Now , focus . I am , but this thing won 't float ! It will . It wants to . Just concentrate , Deeg . Yes ! Yes ! Tutor . You were our tutor . Before you were sent over to the other side , your mother put a spell on all of your memories , in case you were ever taken into the wrong hands . So I 've been told . Well , she sent me now to help you reawaken the memories you 'll need to find the gray gale , and the emerald of the eclipse . Wait , how did you see her if she 's in Azkadellia 's prison ? She came to me in a dream , but she 's growing weaker and weaker . There 's no time to waste . Mystic man said to head south . Then that 's exactly what we should do . Don 't you think , Cain ? South ? Yes , that 's-that 's what I meant . Excuse me . South . Unfortunately , the only road to the south leads through the fields of p-pay . P-Pay ... - I should kill you ! - Shh ! She 's in conference . And I will . I will ... My men just told me that Wyatt Cain is alive . He was here . If she finds out . Finds out what ? That you 're utterly incapable of putting one man in his grave ? I shot him out a window into a freezing lake . That man has nine lives . He 's not the only one . Xora ... That 's my girl . She 's heading south . My men will blitz the area immediately . No , they won 't . You have them dead to rights , and you don 't want to take her ? No . I want her to lead me straight to the emerald . You 've planted a spy . Just keeping an eye on her , as any concerned big sister would . I want you to shadow her . Don 't get too close . Think you can handle a little restraint , Zero ? That can 't be good . Hunter parties are out . Stay sharp . Did it always look so dead ? No , this used to be some of the most fertile land in the O.Z. So , what happened ? Well , about 15 annuals ago , all the crops died , which then caused a great famine . I bet I can guess who 's responsible . Yeah . You 'd think somebody would 've helped them with their crops , maybe ... Engineered a doohickey with a couple ... Thingies ... Got to love a good orchard . Papay once peaceful . Yeah ? Well , now the only peace they 're interested in is a piece of us ! Were farmers . Now hunters . No wonder they 're desperate . - They don 't have any food- - - shh , shh ! Runner scouts . They 're signaling to the others . Run ! Ah ! Good boys . Good boys . Come , it 's almost dinner-time . DG ... Use your gift . To do what ? Focus , DG . You 've got it in you . I don 't know how . Just focus . It isn 't working . Why are they bowing ? Thanking us . That is one heck of a defense , kid . Good , DG . Let 's get out of here . Come on . Easy ... Thank you . Let 's go , let 's go . DG , my darling . You 're shaking like a leaf . What 's wrong ? She fell , and I let go . Oh , what are you talking about ? There 's Az right there . You okay ? Yeah . It looked like you were having a nightmare , a bad one . DG dream of Azkadellia . Yeah . She told me once that we were friends when we were little , and I didn 't believe her , but now I 'm not so sure . Maybe your dream 's trying to tell you something . In my dream , I 'm scared , and my mother is rocking me on a swing ... In a special place . A beautiful place by a lake . Well , there 's about a hundred lakes just south of here . - DG knows which lake . - No , I don 't . You do , DG . Because you were there before , as a little girl . Try . What was it like ? It was ... magical . To get to lake country , we have to cut across the crack in the O.Z. This ain 't going to be easy . I brought you a gift . Bulgar novi . Once extinct in the fields of the papay . I thought I 'd never enjoy their fragrance again . I suppose some things thought dead aren 't always so . Save the poetry for someone who cares . What do you want ? The little witch is reconnecting with her past . Then hope lives . And what about you , Azkadellia ? Perhaps DG isn 't the only one who needs to unlock her memories . I 'm only concerned with the future . Then why are you here talking to me ? Why have you locked me away for all these years , kept my hope alive ? To see your face the day that hope dies . Can 't we rest ? I 'm tired . No time . We have to get to Finaqua . I 'd give my last synapse for a juicy apple . - Apples ... - What is it ? Something Azkadellia said . We 'd explore the woods , gather apples ... Clever how you tricked that old tree to throw fruit at us . I heard tell of it once in a story from the past . We should get back before mother realizes we 're gone , or we 'll be history , too . We are not supposed to be out here alone . She says there 's wild animals in the forest . Did you say what kind of wild animals ? Lions , and tigers , and ... Oh my ! Just hold my hand , Deeg ! Nothing can hurt us if we stay together ! Azkadellia , what happened to you ? Hey , kiddo ... Are you coming ? Yeah . They won 't be puttin ' a zipper on that gaper . Longcoats everywhere . Yeah , we 're not getting past them in broad daylight . The eclipse is almost upon us . We don 't have any time to waste . Look , quick and dead might be okay with you , dogman , but I 'll take slow and breathing any time . Even then , we 're going to need some help . Cabin . Probably full of longcoats . No . Look at the smoke . So they lit a fire . Longcoats get cold , too . It 's blue . Come on . State your business . We mean you no harm . We 're travelers of the realms seeking a warm meal and a cold cup of grog . Food is scarce this time of year , and the grog has long since been seized . Then we will leave you in peace . May your hearth be warm . And your smoke be blue . Come in , quickly . Thank you ... For your help . I 'm that 's my wife , Lorraine . Put your gun on the table . They 're friends , Lorraine . No such thing anymore . It 's okay . We just need shelter till it 's safe to cross . It 's never safe . But the cover of night will help . Until then , sit , rest . News on the resistance in the east ? Well , I was hoping that you would tell us . Do you know anything about a machine that Azkadellia 's building ? Only rumors . We helped a captain from the lowlands . All he said was that Azkadellia was pushing the miners and the metalworkers till they dropped . What mine ? Some mine in the black mountains . Mauritanium . Big " m " , little " t " . Number 216 in the Ozian periodic table . School dys . - I remember a lovely lass named Leona who - - Mauritanium . What 's it for ? Besides its strength , mauritanium is valued for its ability to conduct magical energy . So if she gets ahold of the emerald , she can focus the power however she wants . Not if we get to it first . So it 's a weapon . No , it 's a sunseeder . What 's a sunseeder ? I don 't know , but it sounds cool . Oh , wait ... I invented it . What 's it used for ? I can 't remember . I can 't remember . I 'm sorry , we don 't have time for this . We have to know . Raw ? Calibrating the sequencing is a delicate process . Will it work ? It will work perfectly , sorceress . You have planned well , and nothing will stand in your way . | ? I 'm not so sure about all this . Glitch ... If Azkadellia 's building a machine that you designed , you might be the key to stopping her . I am talking about Fluffy diving into my cranium . Invasion of my privacy and all ... Dark day . Majesty , I bring bad news . The princess Azkadellia has seized Central City . Have our men pull back . To the south . What ? The fourth brigade has fallen . General Lonot has defected . He was our most loyal friend . I 'm so sorry . There was no law other than Azkadellia 's . She tried to steal the plans for the sunseeder . But I was able to destroy the blueprints . She 'll come after you , Ambrose . Is there nothing you can do , majesty ? Too late . The darkness is too deeply rooted in her . But your light . You are the most powerful being in all of the O.Z. Was , old friend . I gave my power and my light to save someone very special . My angel ... Show some respect . The queen 's reign ends today . Do you have any idea what you are doing ? I do . You need a long rest , mother . Take her away , and take him to the alchemist . If you won 't tell me what you know , I guess I 'll just have to reach in and take it myself . Remove the brain slowly . No ... Please don 't-don 't do this . Please , it won 't-it won 't work . - Please . - Count back from 100 . Please ... please ! 99 ... Don 't do it . Don 't ... 98 ... 97 ... 96 ... Oh , my ... Uh , the name 's Glitch , have we ... Are you okay ? Yes , Glitch , I 'm fine . What ? Was my machine so bad ? No . But whatever it is , you sure sacrificed a lot to stop Azkadellia . That 's why she had to go straight to the source . Oh , I guess it wasn 't the biggest sacrifice ever made for science . But it sure is up there . The time to go is now . Full dark and the moons have yet to rise . You okay ? I 'm disappointed in myself . My mother gave up her power to bring me back to life , and that 's how Azkadellia was able to take over . You know , kiddo , there are some things in life that are just ... Out of our control . But we need you . You got to let it go . Come on . - Where did you get this ? - We should go . Where did you get this ? A resistance fighter made it for my son . He came through a few months back with his mother . I think their names were- - Jeb ... And Adora . My family , they really are alive . You 're a lot like her , you know . She wasn 't always all ermine robes and " thee 's " and " thou 's " . She started out just like you . Feisty but fair . My mother 's done so much for me , and I don 't even know her name . Oh , well , that 's easy . Her name was queen ... It 's okay . But she was happy to make the sacrifices she thought were right . We should all love someone that much . Come on . Quickly . Help me with this . Come on . We hide it as best we can . Good . Get it all . There is not much time . Your family crossed this same line , friend . Said they were headed to an old cabin about three spans on the other side , tucked behind a giant white elm , the only one there . Thank you . - We should thank you . - All right , come on . I 'm too big for that thing . Did I ever tell you I was afraid of heights ? You were hanging from the ceiling when I met you . Involuntarily ! If you shape-shift , I swear I 'll dr . - You okay ? - Yeah . All right , let 's go . There . That 's it . That 's where my family made their new home . I really don 't think there 's time for this . He 's always made time for us . Adora ! Jeb ! Adora ! J ? They crossed the gorge . Why continue south ? Nothing there but wasteland and ... Finaqua . That 's the first place you searched for the emerald years ago . It seems the light is helping the pure of heart . Zero awaits your orders . Should he ride to Finaqua ? No , and tell him not to get too close . Your son , Jeb , still lives . No . He lives to honor you . I feel it . You feel too much . Come on , let 's get a move on . You 've sent her into the heart of darkness , mother . Why Finaqua ? She needs to know what she 's up against . Which way now ? Well , both ways head south . Your mother said your memories would guide you , DG . Let them . I don 't know , it looks familiar . Well , dig deeper . Remember , DG . I remember ... Her swinging me on a swing , and the suns reflecting in my eyes , and the breeze off the water . Oh , what 's that ? No ! Sorceress ! Water.Water ... Right away . Xora ? What happened ? Little beastie just came out of nowhere . Why did it attack now ? Probably a random hit . It 's dead now . Great . Maybe we should just move along like it never happened . Never happened ? Once az finds out that this one 's missing , she 's going to have longcoats crawling all over the zone looking for it . All the more reason to get moving . You okay ? You 're sweating up a storm . I 'm fine . I know . Come on ! What is this ? - She 's found something . - Come on . This way , come on . DG ! Where are we ? DG , this way . DG ? Where is she ? - I just saw her . - Where ? DG ! Come on , come on . You were right about the magical waters , DG . That 's what " Finaqua " means in the ancient 's language . Not sure about the translation now though . This used to be paradise . Not paradise now . It was one of the first places Az scorched when she came to power . Well , she sure didn 't leave much . No . Your adventures have a way of getting me into trouble ... What was that ? Wait , guys , let her find it alone . two little princesses dancing in a row spinning fast and freely on their little toes where the light will take them they will never know ... Did you hear that ? Hear what ? Let 's go see what it is . No , we should get back . Mom said to stay close . If we did everything mom said , we 'd never have any fun . Come on , it 's like an adventure . Your adventures have a way of getting me into trouble . two little princesses dancing in a row spinning fast and freely on their little toes where the light will take them they will never know two little princesses dancing in a row dancing in a row dancing in a row ... Remember . Help ! Do you hear that ? We should go get mom and dad . Your adventures have a way of getting me into trouble . Hello ! Look at this . It 's the picture language of the ancients . Can you tell what it means ? Some . At the dawn of time , good battled evil , and the light conquered over the darkness , and something about an evil witch ... Well ... That was fun . Wait . What is this place ? It looks ancient . Maybe it 's a tomb . I 'm not sure , but that face creeps me out . Let 's go . Don 't you t ? there 's someone trapped in there . DG ! What have we done ? Hey , are you okay ? No , wait . How did you get here ? Help me ! Our parents aren 't far . We 'll go and bring back help . No ! I mean ... Please , don 't leave me alone . I 've been waiting ... Calling . I thought this day would never come . The magic is strong in you . Let go . No . - Don 't let go . - But I 'm scared . We have to stay together . You can let go , little girl . No . T ? go no ! DG my darling , you 're shaking like a leaf . What 's wrong ? Az ... She fell , and I let go . What are you talking about ? There 's Az right there . Azkadellia , are you all right ? Of course , mother . I 've never felt better . I 'si sorry , mer . All the terrible things that have happened , they were all my fault . I should never have let go . Excuse the interruption , sorceress , but without Xora 's reports , Zero would like to know if you 'd wish him to pick up the trail . I will pick up the trail myself . Find her .

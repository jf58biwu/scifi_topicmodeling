 Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future . The 2 1 st century is when everything changes . And you 've gotta be ready . Dad ? I don 't know , hour and a half , tops . I 'll be there as soon as I can . I can 't hear you . The signal 's going . Hello ? Are you all right ? Come on ! Leave me alone ! I hate the countryside . It 's dirty . It 's unhygienic . And what is that smell ? That would be grass . It 's disgusting . Seventeen disappearances within the last five months . Police are clueless . Now there 's a surprise . No offence , PC Cooper . The last known whereabouts of each one is somewhere around here . All within a 20-mile radius . - Anything else linking them ? - None of the bodies have ever been found . These people just fell off the radar . No patterns in age , sex , race . One minute , they 're here . The next , gone . The rift doesn 't spread out this far , does it ? We don 't know that much about it to be certain , and it 's increasing in activity all the time . Oh , come on , aliens aren 't gonna bother hanging round out here . Probably some sort of weird suicide club with people choosing the same spot to end it all . Oh , God knows if I had to spend too long up here , I 'd want to top myself . Here you go . Careful , they 're hot . - Sure you don 't want anything , Tosh ? - Really sure . A friend of mine caught hepatitis off a burger from one of these places . We 'll start with the most recent victim , Ellie Johnson . We last have record of her making a phone call . She dropped out of signal mid-call . The coverage map has her placed somewhere about here . Looks as good a place as any to set up camp . Sorry , did you say " camp " ? - What 's the matter with a hotel ? - People are going missing round here . Do you really wanna stay in a place run by strangers ? Oh , ' cause sleeping outside is gonna be a lot safer ! No other race in the universe goes camping . Celebrate your own uniqueness . What am I supposed to do with this ? Need a hand getting it up , Owen ? If I did , I wouldn 't ask you . - Some pieces are missing ! - No , I checked . Oh , come on , it 's just a bit of fun ! Who was the last person you snogged ? You even sound like an eight-year-old . Who the hell says " snog " ? - Mine was Rhys . - Yeah , well , there 's a surprise . - Tosh , your go . - It 's easy for you . Oh , come on , spill the beans ! - Owen . - What ? - Really ? - Tosh , only in your dreams . 3 : 00 a.m. , Christmas Eve , in front of the Millennium Centre , waiting for a cab . - I had mistletoe . - Christmas ? - You 've not had a snog since . - No . Well , lucky me , eh ? So who was yours ? Gwen , actually . When was this ? It was complicated . Didn 't take you long to get your feet under the table . What ? - So was it just a kiss or ... - Tosh , leave it . Jack , are we including non-human life-forms ? You haven 't ! You 're a sick man , Harkness ! That is disgusting ! I never know when he 's joking . It 's my turn , is it ? It was Lisa . Ianto , I 'm sorry . Sorry she 's dead or sorry you mentioned it ? I just didn 't think . You forgot . - We should get some firewood . - I 'll give you a hand . - Couldn 't you have kept that to yourself ? - What 's the matter ? You embarrassed ? You 're such an arrogant shit sometimes , Owen ! See , to my mind , that was a good kiss . It was borderline great , so good , in fact , you 've been avoiding me ever since . Ha ! Country air 's making you delusional . How long did it last , 10 seconds ? And the things I can tell from that kiss ! - Oh , like ? - Like your sex life ain 't up to much . You what ? See , old Rhys makes the earth rumble , but he don 't make it move , does he ? You better shut up before I lamp you one . When was the last time you screwed all night ? When was the last time you came so hard and so long you forgot where you are ? Doesn 't happen with him , does it ? You 're too familiar . Whereas , you and me , we 're not cosy at all . We 'd be amazing , and that scares the shit out of you . Someone ... Someone 's watching us , through the trees . Fifty yards north . I just saw them move . - You got your gun ? - Yes . You go to the left . I 'll go right . Three , two , one . Bollocks ! How did we lose him ? Owen . Well , it 's not Ellie Johnson . That 's for sure . This is a male , late 40s , 50s . Wasn 't killed here . No blood spatter or signs of struggle . Must have been brought here after he died . Why do that ? It 's not like they tried to bury him here . Maybe you disturbed them and they ran away . Or maybe it 's a warning , whoever 's responsible marking out their territory . Cause of death ? Impossible to say . Body 's been stripped of the flesh and bodily organs , so all that 's left is the carcass . Could the Weevils have come out this far ? No , Weevils don 't finish off their victims like this . - Is that ours ? - Yeah . All right , I said I 'm sorry ! - Basic security protocols , Owen ! - Oh , get off your high horse , Tosh ! - I was carrying that stupid gear . - What , the whole time ? Yeah , then I was trying to put that bloody tent up , and then ... Well , yeah , I sort of forgot that I 'd left them in there . But I 'm sorry . I 'm human . I ballsed up . Looks like that body wasn 't a warning . More of a decoy . That would mean we 've been watched since we 've arrived . - Tosh , can you get a tracking signal ? - Already done . I took the liberty . It 's currently 3.4 miles west from here . Gunning at 90 , no doubt . You steal a piece of equipment like that , you drive straight on till morning . Actually , no , it 's been stationary for the past four minutes . I 'd go so far as to say it was parked . There 's a small village in that area . Other than that , nothing for 30 miles . Call me suspicious , but this has all the hallmarks of a trap . Yeah , I was just thinking the same thing . Anyone fancy a walk ? Why would anyone want to live out here ? - Has the SUV moved ? - Not for an hour now . Tosh , Ianto , follow the signal . Find the SUV . Owen , Gwen , let 's see if there 's any room at the inn . Pint of the best , please , love , and , yeah , get one for yourself . Where is everybody ? - You okay ? - In there . Burger coming back to haunt you ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Gwen ! Jack . Jack , please . Please tell me what 's going on here . Let 's take a look in here . Come on . One , two , three . What is it ? There 's another body in there . Same as the other . What did this , Jack ? ' Cause whatever it is , it can 't be human . - How far is this going to spread ? - Stay focused . I should be at home , having dinner with Rhys . What am I doing here with you ? Don 't you ever get scared , Jack ? H uh ? There 's another two houses . We 'd better take a look . Whatever they were , I hope you put up a good fight . It 's just half a mile up here . At least we 've still got this . The rest of my stuff was in the vehicle . What was that ? Just a fox or something . - Check round the back ? - Yeah . We should carry on straight up there . Tosh ! Tosh ! Tosh ! Okay , okay . - Locked ? - Locked . Gwen ! Gwen ! Gwen ! Gwen ! Put the gun down on the floor ! Put the gun down on the floor ! Look , I thought you were them ! I thought you 'd come back for me . Thought who 'd come back for you ? Who ? Gwen ! Gwen ! - Gwen , what 's happened ? What 's happened ? - The kid hit her with a shotgun . - Up . Get up . I got you . I got you . I got you . - Move , move , move ! Move ! Move ! Get in . Move ! Get her here . - Okay , I 'll check upstairs . - Okay . Owen ! Owen ! Bet you thought you 'd never be glad to see me , right ? - No , please ! - All right . All right ! Listen ! Listen , I 'm gonna have a look at your wound now , okay ? Just keep calm . - Hands off . Hands off . - No , don 't , please . - Okay . - Don 't . - Right , could 've been much worse . - Let me see . Let me ... Hold this . Apply pressure . Jesus ! The bullets are lodged near the surface . You 've been bloody lucky , girl . Another inch to the left , any one of your vital organs might 've been ... Anyway . All right , do you want a quip about feeling a small prick ? No , but thanks for offering . Here we go . No ! All done . - God ! - Now , let 's get the pellets out , eh ? All right , now , there 's gonna be a certain amount of residue , so just lie back , think of Torchwood . - Do you miss being a doctor ? - Excuse me , I still am a doctor . I just don 't deal with patients any more . That 's all . It 's ideal . That was the bit I always hated . Ah ! You beauty . Come on , I 'm good . Not bad . What 's taking Tosh and Ianto so long ? Jack , give them a chance . The SUV might be locked up or under guard . Or they could be dead ! Well , everyone else is . Sit down ! - Tell us what happened here . - It 's not human . Look , my mum won 't know what 's happened . They 're only expecting me back for the weekend . - Look , we 'll get you home , okay ? - What are you gonna do ? You can 't fight them . They 're too strong . The only thing we can do is barricade the door . No ! We 'll make base at the pub . What about Tosh and Ianto ? Should we go after them ? - Not till we know what we 're dealing with . - What if it 's too late ? They 're not children . They know what to do . - Let 's go . - No , it 's all right . I 've got it . Yeah , Owen ? Owen , I can do it on my own . Whoa ! Okay . Look , I 'm sorry about your friends . You know , I never liked camping . Don 't bother . They took the guns . Charming place they 've got . Judging by the sound reverberations and the air quality , pretty deep underground . - Chances of rescue ? - We won 't need rescuing . Haven 't met a cell yet I couldn 't get out of . What were they ? I don 't know . It happened too quickly . - You worried ? - A little . That body we saw in the forest ... Don 't think about it . See if you can get that light to work , huh ? You 're used to this , aren 't you ? That facial expression you all share when things get a bit out of control , like you enjoy it , like you get a high from the danger . You want me to apologise for that ? Don 't you ever wonder how long you can survive before you either go mad or get killed or lose a loved one ? It 's worth the risk to protect people . And who protects us ? - God , I 'm hungry . - You should 've had that cheeseburger . Not that hungry . What 's that ? You found something . It 's just a shoe . Wait . There 's another . - There 's dozens of them . - Oh , my God . - How many people have been down here ? - And what happened to them ? Is that a fridge ? Tosh , what is it ? What 's in there ? - Tell me ! - Ianto , don 't . I want to know . That 's why there was nothing left on the body . They need to eat . We 're food . So , if we barricade ourselves in , what happens to Tosh and Ianto ? Why are we still talking about this ? Tosh and Ianto can look after themselves . The kid is our first priority . Now , they 've already been for him once . They 're not going to give up that easily . So have we ever heard of a species who strip human bodies of flesh and organs ? What are you doing ? You need to rest . Compiling what we 've got , seeing if it helps . We have to assume the others who disappeared have been killed , too . - So you think there 's been 17 deaths ? - At least . - These aren 't casual killers . - Okay . So all this means the rift is spreading , and it 's dumping aliens and psychos wherever it fancies . Looks like that . Great . This conversation 's cheered me up no end . - Did you see that ? - Somebody outside ? Was that the same one or different ? He said they 'd come back . Let 's not jump to conclusions . We don 't know who they are or what their intentions are . I 'm thinking that 's not a good sign . - They 've come back . - Kieran , listen to my voice , okay ? Just come back . Kieran ! Okay , so we didn 't check the cellar . - You can 't let them in ! - Kieran , come back from the door . - Don 't let them in ! - Sit down ! We 've got this under control ! You don 't understand . You don 't know what they 're like . Kieran ! No , please ! Please no , not me ! - Kieran ! - Help me ! It 's pitch black ! You don 't have any tracking devices ! - Do you wanna get yourself killed ? - Get out of my way ! Look , whatever 's in that cellar took three bullets . I heard it fall . Once we know what it is , then we 'll know how to deal with it . You do that . We 'll go after Kieran and the others . - You are wounded ! - Do you think that 's gonna stop me ? Be careful . Go . Got to be three steel bolts , top , middle and bottom . How are you at calculating target stress points ? Find the weakest point . Bit of brute force ... N ice thought , but it 's reinforced . Get off ! Look at me , you idiot ! I 'm not gonna hurt you ! - You 've got a gun . - I promise ! I promise ! Okay , okay , give her some space . Thank you . Were you injured when they took you ? Can I see ? I 'm a nurse . Okay . Okay , okay . Does anyone else know you 're here ? Have you managed to call for help ? We don 't need any help . There 's three more of us in the village . I can 't help you . I 'm sorry . What do you mean ? I 've been sent to collect you . I 've got to take you to them . Tell us what 's going on . We can help . No one 's safe . Every 10 years , it takes us again . - What takes you ? What is it ? - The harvest . No , please , you have to come with me . - Help me . Please help . - Did you attack us ? I 'm dying . Help me . I 'll tell you everything . This 'll help you for a short amount of time . Now start talking . You 've got to get help . I know where you can get some ... We had a deal . I help you . You tell me where they 've taken the boy and what the hell is going on around here . You don 't know ! What are you doing ? Put it back ! You need to know something . A long time ago , I was pretty good at torture . You see , I had quite a reputation as the go-to guy . My job demanded it at the time , you see . So I know where to apply the tiniest amount of pressure to a wound like yours ... You 've got to stop ! You 're gonna kill me ! Oh , please stop ! It 's in your power to make me stop . Just tell me what I need to know because in 10 seconds , I 'm gonna find a sharp object . All right , I 'll tell you everything . Just stop . Now talk . - You sure you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . - That 's all we bloody need . - Let me do the talking . I 'll get rid of him . Who are you , please ? Special ops . We 're Torchwood . Have you heard of Torchwood ? What 's that , then , a band , is it ? What 's wrong with her ? Mate , you wouldn 't understand . What 's that light ? What 's that light over there ? The big house ? Sort of unofficial village hall . Village meeting tonight . That 's why I 'm here . Constabulary report . - Come on . - Where do you think you 're going ? In there , please . If you help us , we can stop all this . Please . I 'm sorry . Get back . Oh , God , that stench . Tell us what these creatures are . Do they look like us ? How else are we gonna look ? - There are three more out there . - Not a problem . - How are they ? - They 're in a good state . - I think they 're the best we 've ever had . - Yeah ? Oh , I forgot to tell you . I caught the boy , finally . Come on . Come on , will you ? Look , I won 't tell anyone . - Look . - Who is he ? He 's meat . I 'm afraid we 're all just meat . Get ready to run . What are you gonna do , put us on meat hooks ? No , not yet . You see , meat has to be tenderised first . Good , good . Run ! Get the others ! I know you 're here . No one 's coming for you . Yes , yes ! No more games . H ush now . H ush . Get off her , or I 'll shoot . Get off her , or I 'll shoot ! We saw the torchlight . They 've murdered all the villagers . They 're cannibalising the bodies . - Put the gun down . - You 're in no position to negotiate , mate . It 's all right . It 's all right . You 're safe . You can arrest him now . I said , you can arrest him . Are you gonna arrest me , H uw ? That 'd be a laugh , wouldn 't it ? My own uncle . - Put the gun down . Don 't you hurt him . - Shoot the bastard . - Split his skull . - Put the fucking gun down ! - Shoot . - I will shoot you ! Put it down ! Pull the trigger , H uw ! Why don 't you give me the gun , " mate " ? Who are these people ? - This is our village . - Villagers are dead ! They 're all involved . They 've all been doing it . This is our harvest . Only in the bloody countryside . You sick fuckers ! No ! No ! Are you okay ? Where 's Ianto ? What have you done with him ? Wake up , man . Yeah , time to be bled . Like veal , it takes a long time , but it definitely makes the meat taste better . What now ? What the fuck ? Oh , really ? No , Jack , don 't do it ! These people don 't deserve warnings . Let me question him . I have to understand . I want to know why . Otherwise , this ... This is too much . They 're injured . They need to get to a hospital . Owen , you control the bleeding , then phone the police . Jack , please , give me an hour with him . Don 't tell me you don 't want to know , too . The whole village was involved ? Every generation . Our tradition . Once a decade , target those travelling through , those most likely to disappear . And butcher them . What sort of people are you that you wake up in the morning and think , " This is what I 'm gonna do " ? Why 'd you do it ? Come on , make me understand . Why do you care ? I have seen things you would never believe , and this is the only thing I can 't understand . - So keep on wondering . - Tell me ! I need to know why ! That 's enough . Time to go . I 'll tell you something if you let me whisper . Wait . Okay . 'Cause it made me happy . Come on . Out . I had a good job before this . I thought , in a year or two , perhaps a baby . I know Rhys would be a good dad , and I could try for Desk Sergeant and ... Well , it was all slotting into place , and then I met you lot . All these things ... All these things , they 're changing me . Changing how I see the world , and I can 't share them with anyone . You can now . What is this thing ? With this , you can read people 's minds . It levels the pitch between man and God . It will find you . My guess is you 're not from around these parts . Shagging a woman and an alien . Wouldn 't be the first time I 'd been a rebound shag . You need to see this . This is completely impossible . - Tell me what to do . - Get me into Torchwood .

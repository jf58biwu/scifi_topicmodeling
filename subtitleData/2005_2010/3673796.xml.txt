 " Destiny ... " The design is clearly ancient , Launched hundreds of thousands of years ago . Where the hell are we ? Several billion light-years from home . We 're on a ship , But we have no idea where we are , In relation to earth . This ship could be the most important discovery Mankind has made since the stargate itself . These are the wrong people in the wrong place ... We 've got a lot of wounded , and we need to get home . We barely have enough power to operate the main systems . This ship simply doesn 't have the capability to dial earth . We 've got a problem- - One of the air vents just shut down in here . Our first priority must be to seal off any of the leaks . We can maybe buy ourselves A day or so Before the build-up of co2 kills us . We can 't ask someone to sacrifice themselves , Period ! Dad ! No ! Wait ! It looks like we 've dropped out of ftl . the ship detected a stargate On a planet within range That may have what we need . What we need 's on the other side of that wormhole . Hot . cool . make sure we can dial back to the ship . already on it . Looks like gypsum . That would be good . Why ? We 're looking for calcium carbonate . calcite . Gypsum is calcium sulphate , Which is 36 % calcium carbonate . Hmm . Huh . It dissolves . You saying we can use this sand to fix the scrubbers ? That would be convenient . no . well , it 's a fair indication That the components may exist nearby . for the sake of portability and efficiency , I 'm hoping to find High-concentration granular limestone . We are looking for the dried lake bed Or salt-water body all this sand came from . It 's a desert . Lime is formed mostly from the remains Of marine organisms . Are you saying there was life here ? not likely anything we 've seen before . Yeah , the water may be gone now , But this desert was formed By h2o evaporating on a playa floor , Causing gypsum to be deposited In a fine crystalline form called selenite- - Where 're you going ? Higher ground . What 's supposed to happen ? If this sand is high enough in calcite concentration , The solution would absorb the acid . Right . The liquid would turn clear . It 's not . We 're good ! This is Scott . Unfortunately , there 's nothing useful In the immediate vicinity of the gate . you have 12 hours , lieutenant . Make ' em count . Copy that . We 're moving out ! Too bad we can 't just use this sand . There certainly is enough of it . I 'm fine . No , you 're not . And neither am I , but we 're , uh ... We 're still alive because of what he did- - For what it 's worth- - It 's worth a lot . And , you know , as long as we 're still here , I promise you- - Colonel , I 've edited enough of my father 's speeches To know what you 're going to say , and- - You don 't have a clue what I was going to say , Because I don 't . We , um ... We brought along , um ... An ancient device , communications stones , They allow us to- - Yeah , I know what they are . Good , well , I 'm about to use one of them To report to my superiors on earth , Tell them our situation . I want to tell her myself . You 've been sitting here since rush made contact . Let somebody else take a shift . I 'm not leaving this chair . I 've been on this project for the last six months , And I 'll be damned if I ... Colonel ? This is strange ... Dr. Rush , is that you ? No , it 's colonel young , And I need you to put me in a room with general o 'neill . And I 'm going to need you , too . sir , I told you not to get up ! What did he do to himself ? He 's got cracked ribs , more bruises than I can count , And a concussion that resulted in neuropraxia . Oh , that 's just great . Chloe ? Dr. Mehta . Can you help me , please ? You , know , I had some of my favorite arguments With your father . Are you saying you won some ? Depends on who you ask . Listen , uh ... Major green 'll be escorting you to see your mother . Please ... Give her my condolences . Thank you . Yeah . So how is it going out there ? Really . I don 't know what rush has told you . We may not have much time left . The ship 's very old , falling apart . Fix it . We 're trying . Even if we can get the life support working , We don 't have much food and water . Then go get some . We 're not supposed to be there , sir . These are the wrong people in the wrong place , And , as a group , they 're just not qualified . Oh , please . I wasn 't qualified to lead that first team Through the stargate ... I understand that , sir . In the past dozen years or so , We 've sent hundreds of teams through that thing ... And , the bottom line is ... None of us are qualified . I just think we 're going to get to a point very soon Where everyone on board Should get a chance to say goodbye . Understood . Save it . that 's not very smart . Temperatures like these , the human body needs at least- - walk , don 't talk . Just fyi , He 's right about the whole human body-and-water- - Eli ! walk , don 't ... Right . Oh . Look . More sand . This is pointless . We should go back . We just got here . I still think we should be checking out The other planets in range of the ship . I still think you 're wrong . The solution 's here . I know it was a mirage , But when we were walking over that last dune ? I thought I saw the statue of liberty Sticking half out of the sand ... Just for a second there , I was all ready to yell- - " damn you ! Damn you all to hell ! " On ! That was funny.L to hell ! " Was it ? Because ! It would mean we were really on earth , But in the future ... And the apes had taken over ... And then buried the statue of liberty For some reason . Eli ? Have a drink . Greer , hold up ! Hold up ! This isn 't going to work . Not if we keep stopping . I 'm saying we need to split up . Fine with me . I agree . Franklin , you should come with me . Nah- - no , no , no , you 're with me and greer . Sun 's been moving that way , we 'll call it west ... Uh , Eli , franklin , palmer ... And curtis , You head that way . We 'll test every 20 minutes or so . After two hours , you head south-east ... That should take you back in the direction of the gate . Whoa , whoa , whoa , wait a second . do we really think That splitting up is the best idea ? I say we head straight back . There 's no point in crossing over The same territory we 've just crossed . Or ... We could just stick together . Look , matt ... I 'm sorry , I just have this really ... Really sick feeling That you 're going to go that way ... And we 're going to go this way ... Eli , I need someone that I can trust To lead the second team , okay ? That is you . Curtis is a good soldier , he 's a tough guy . He 's not going to let anything happen to you . Truth is , I 'm slowing you down , And you want to get rid of me . I 'm doing what I think Will best accomplish this mission . You asked to come . I 'm telling you how you can help me . Now suck it up . Yeah . Okay . Okay , guys , we 're going this way . Move out ! Radio if you find the lake bed , We 'll double back . when you see the statue of liberty , You know what to say , right ? Right . Now we can make some time . she 's here ? Right now ? Yes , ma 'am , but as I 've explained- - Chloe ! Mrs. Armstrong- - I know I look different , And I sound different But it 's me . Mom , please . I have something to tell you . Mom ... stop ! I 'm sorry ... It 's just ... The thought That you 're actually on some ship ... So far away , I can 't even imagine . Mom ? just tell me you 're coming home ? I don 't know ... Mom , please ! the ship is old And damaged . We were losing air and somebody had to- - He 's dead . He 's dead , isn 't he ? Where is everyone ? Able bodies are searching the ship For anything that might have Co2-sequestration properties , And the rest are in crew quarters . Colonel , we were able to dial out to the planet again . colonel young and chloe Are using the communication stones . This is colonel telford , dr . Mehta . Uh ... O- - r - right , okay . Did you make radio contact with the off-world team ? Uh , yes , nothing to report yet . They 've split up . How much time before the ship jumps back to ftl ? Roughly nine hours . dial out every 20 minutes . Maintain regular contact . We do have power issues to be aware of . Dialing the gate is a significant drain On what seems to be limited resources at this point . The away mission is priority one right now . Sir ? I 'm fine . I understand that there are other stargates in range ? Four other addresses came up in the system , But we seem to be locked out from here . Have you tried working around it ? Dr. Rush didn 't think that was a good idea . I think it makes sense to know what our options are . Do what you can . there has to be a good reason Why these addresses are being disqualified . If I wasn 't being clear , I was giving you an order . If there are good reasons , find out exactly what they are . Let 's keep moving , I want to see more . You should rest . lieutenant . Sir , colonel young 's body needs time to recover . Give me something for the pain . The body feels pain for a reason . I would rather not mask it . Just do it , lieutenant . From the sounds of things , you need my help here . All right , come on . Let 's go . You better save some of that . we need to slow down . We need to cover more ground . It 's going to be impossible To maintain this pace on the way back . maybe for you . How tedious- - little boys playing " soldier . " Well , I 'm sorry , I 've no interest in playing that game . I 'm not playing anything , I 'm trying to save the lives of everyone aboard that ship . If you continue at this pace , we 're going to die out here- - then maybe we will . ... Light-years away From the admiring eyes of your father , Or your drill sergeant ... Or whoever 's approval it is you so desperately seek . - how dare you ! - get up and move . Did you see that ? What ? I don 't know ... Nothing . Let 's move . One hour- - one hour , and then we start circling back . All right , fine . Just hold that there . Thank you . What did you give me ? That was supposed to be for the pain . What did you give to him ? A strong sedative , Which we are desperately short on And I should not have had to use just so that colonel young Can return to a body in working condition . You are out of line , lieutenant . Disregarding the health of another human being Is out of line . I am well within my rights as ranking medical officer . He 'll be out an hour or two . Well , what am I supposed to do ? I don 't care . I have other patients to attend to . Something wrong ? No , I 'm fine . Good a place as any to stop and test . I take it that 's not good ? No . Hey , guys . Another negative over here . I 'll radio Scott and tell him we 're moving on . Uh , yeah , but ... That 's not what 's going down . It 's not ? No . There are four other viable addresses In this thing . I think I found an override That 'll allow us to dial from here- - Yeah , but- - Look around . This planet is a dead zone . But- - We should 've been trying to dial These other planets from the start . Rush said- - We don 't care what rush said . We don 't trust him . Rush doesn 't want us all to die . that doesn 't mean We trust him to make the right decisions . You too ? What about the lake bed ? It could be hundreds of miles from here . We could be blowing our only chance Of finding a decent place to evac . Maybe the ship did bring us here Because there 's lime on this planet . For all we know , The ancients had a way of locating it That we don 't . for that matter , I 'm sure they could 've stopped the ship For longer than 12 hours to find it And recover it with the proper tools . The fact is , the ancients wouldn 't have Let the life-support system get that screwed up In the first place . Rush is set on fixing the ship . He 's deaf to any other logic . We need to find a planet we can survive on . This might be our last chance . Gotta keep goin ' . Here . Take it . I have my own . No , no . I can 't go on . I 'm never going to make it back . I know it 's here . You have to find it . Take it . We 're going to leave him here ? I 'll make my way back to the gate . Go with him . I 'm not leaving you here alone . make sure he gets back alive . What difference does it make ? Because if I don 't find what we need , He 's going to be the one To find some other way to save his own ass And yours along with it . you 're losing it . I 'll be okay . Scott , this is Eli . Come in ? If you can hear me , please respond . This is Scott , what 's up ? We have a problem . Franklin , curtis and palmer Have given up and are headed back to the gate To try dialing the other addresses in the remote . They also have the kino . They don 't think we 're going to find the lime here . They want to look for another planet That will support life . They 'll get themselves killed . Don 't we need that remote to get back to the ship ? That 's not the point . A few hours is nowhere near enough time To determine whether a planet is even safe , Let alone viable for sustaining life . The ship ... The ship 's our only real hope of ever getting home . Stop them if you can . I 'll turn back when I have to . Yes , sir . Go ! You lead . I 'm sorry , excuse me . Miss armstrong , We 've got to get going soon . You get my daughter home . Everyone is doing the best they can , I assure you . That 's not good enough . Mom , it 's not his fault . I 'm a personal friend Of the president and of the first lady . Yes , ma 'am . You tell your superiors that if anything happens to her , I will go public with what I know . Mom- - I 'm sorry , she 's upset . My husband ... Gave his life for my daughter . You get her back to me , Or the whole world is going to know What has really been going on these past years . I need water . We 're almost there . I thought since I gave Scott my canteen , We 'd share . And you were wrong about that . Yeah , I should 've known . Yeah ? You think you know me pretty well , Don 't you ? I helped choose the personnel for icarus base . I read your file . And neither you nor captain marvel Were on my list , let me tell you . Ooh-hoo-hoo . You think I care ? Give me some water . keep walkin ' . You think , Just because you were born poor , That it gives you the right to be angry at the world , How pathetic . Oh , yeah ? You think that 's why I 'm " angry ? " If it wasn 't for the army , You 'd be in jail , or worse . Aw , that 's what all you rich people think . Rich ? My fathepyards in glasgow . I earned a scholarship to oxford While I was working two jobs . I have got a right to make decisions Without explaining myself to you or anyone else . You give me some of that water ! Keep walkin ' . You give me some of that w- - Don 't you ever touch me . Give me some- - Me- - don 't you ever touch me . And you do that again , And I 'm gonna put a bullet In your face . Oh , really ? I don 't think so . You need me . Otherwise , you 'd have gladly done it by now . Right now , I pray to the god above That dehydration will shut you the hell up . Walk ! Or die here ! It 's your choice , mister ... " ... Decision-maker . " Looks like it 's worth a shot to me . Let 's do it . wait ! stop ! Look , it 's not perfect , but it 's better than here . Vegetation , water , air ... It 's not too late for you to come with us . No , no . we 'll dial back When we know it 's safe to evacuate everyone . you 'll never get back home . You don 't know that . Maybe there 's a way to use the gate system To connect the dots . There has to be a reason The ship locked out those addresses ! Don 't . Please ? Shoot him ! Why did you do that ? He told me to . We saved his life . By shooting him ? He 'll live . You just stranded curtis and palmer . We 'll send them another remote . I wasn 't taking any chances . Where 's Scott ? Still looking for limestone . It 's almost half-time . We only have six hours before the ship leaves . Lieutenant , this is greer . Come in . I hope he 's turned back by now . Lieutenant ! Come in ? You must keep going , my boy . Don 't give up . I don 't need you to tell me that . I 'm not going to let anyone else down The way I let you down . You really don 't have to follow me around To remind me . He has his plan ... For all of us . He 's either out of radio range Or he 's lying face-down in the sand , Dead , or soon-to-be . I 'm going back for him . Well , that 's great- - suicide . I 'm not leaving him out here . I 'll go with you , man . Nah , you 're just gonna slow me down . Look , this man has to get back to the ship . He needs medical attention . Dial . He can take franklin back . You wait here for me . You have five hours to find him And get back here . Well , it has not been a pleasure knowing you . What do I need that for ? Just in case . In case what ? Hey , I don 't even know how to fire this thing . You 'd better be here . I will . I have a gun . Why do I feel like I 've been drugged ? Good to have you back , sir . Son of a ... What the hell was telford doing ? You 're going to need this . There they are . Hurry up , hurry up . Come on , help him , help him . What happened ? Greer ... Greer shot him . Water ? That was my ration for the day . What 's going on ? Oh , we 've had a lovely day at the beach . How about you ? I have sinned , father . I 've failed you . I 've failed him . I 've failed myself . We have redemption through his blood . Curtis ? Palmer ? This is Eli . If you can hear me , please come in . Curtis . Palmer . Please , respond . do you love her ? She 's not going to have it . You 're sure ? She 's 16 . We barely even know each other . What are you going to do ? I don 't know ... About anything . I thought ... He was my calling . But now ... I am sorry . Why ? I 'm the one who 's weak . It 's my fault . No ... It isn 't . It 's not yours . This is Scott ! Come in ! I found it , I found the lake bed ! I 've got the lime ! oh , my god . If y-you can hear me , wait ! Just wait , I 'm coming ! Eli . Which way ? Move out . Scott ... Come on ... Come on . Come on , Scott , come on . take the bag ! There 's no time ! You have to take it . Yes , you can . No , I can 't make it- - get the hell up ! Come on ! I can 't make it . oh ! I can 't carry you and this ! Get your weak ass up ! Come on ! Come on , soldier ! Less than three minutes before the ship jumps again . Incoming ! I 'll stay . It 's okay . I got it . Sorry , sir . You did your best . Less than one minute . I see them . I see them ! They 're carrying something ! we 've got it ! Don 't go ! We 've got it ! They 've got the lime ! And they 're not going to make it . 40 seconds . Give me the radio . Eli , I want you to stick your arm Into the event horizon of the puddle . Seriously ? Are you sure ? No . But I 'm betting there 's some kind of a safety protocol Prevents someone being cut-off while en route . But what if there isn 't ? 20 seconds . Eli , do it now ! Come on . come on ! Five ... Four ... Three ... Two ... One- - Good , Eli . Thank you . Scott , look at me . Lieutenant , look at me . Look at me ! Look at me . Well done , Eli .

My hands were trying to keep you warm , your hands were keeping me warm , and we both got , you know , excited , and we left the game in the seventh inning 'cause we couldn 't wait to get home to have sex . Now , I drove through red lights . We were kissing while I was driving . We ran into that apartment and ... we didn 't slow down.We just ... - we didn 't even make it to the bed . - No . - Nine months later , our son was born . - No . - His name is zack ! - No , dan.No We went to see the giants , and you left early . What ? The paper called you in because the new , uh ... nanotechs crashed at the register , and you lost the story you were working on . Nanotechs ? Your computer at the register . You went to work , dan . Caroline was conceived around that time , but it wasn 't after a baseball game . Okay . Okay.Uh ... I need to get our life back tomorrow . What ? Are you done ? Don 't you change anything . Of course not.This is our family . I wouldn 't change a thing . Morning . Ah , hey . Hey.Sleep in ? Oh , tough night . That annette sure is an original . Yeah.That 's one way of saying it . So you left to cover a drug heist story , and there 's nothing about it on ... the hennessey trial preview.I wanted to get a jump on it . And I have five days with my sister-in-law so , yeah , I bailed . Yeah.And left us behind to mop up . This just came off the wire . Hennessey 's defense team leaked the deposition .

Seven , eight years ago.Why ? Oh , just curious . Wow . What about you ? What about me ? You 're standing where a man was murdered a month ago . Can 't be business as usual for you .

You 'll see your future roll out in front of you like a long stretch of desert road . You 'll be able to avoid the potholes . What is he , a psychic ? Yes , she is . Hello , mrs.Cupper.

Yeah , I did get thrown out of the place where you worked , but listen , I ... I want to help you . Please ? not bad shooting for a guy who sang men 's chorale . You think you can beat it ? Aw , you really want me to humiliate you in front of your buddies ? How 's garrity 's family ? They were divorced . He was a loner . It 's sad , really . Yeah , it is . - So , listen ... - can 't do it , jackie . Gus ... jack , it 's from the top . All right , listen to me . My brother was the subject of an illegal investigation . I 'm the only thing standing between this bureau and a federal lawsuit . And don 't think he doesn 't have a strong case . You got a rogue fbi agent looking for time travelers , gus ? I mean , how 's that gonna play in D.C. ? Jack , we 're friends . I 'm the one who confirmed that garrity was rogue . And this is how you thank me ? By threatening us with a lawsuit ? We just want to know what garrity knew . He was a nut and it got him killed , man . If he 'd been doing his job , he 'd be alive today . That 's what you should do , jack.Do your job . Ten minutes looking at his files you sit right next to me . Or we flip the switch . Thank you , counsel , we 'll make sure thatthat 's off the record . Bye . - Dan vasser ? - Yeah . Sandra cupper . How did you know I was ... ? You have a very distinctive voice . Uh , please sit . You know , you didn 't have to come down here . I-I could have come to you . I don 't like people to know where I live . Right . How did you lose your eyesight ? Diabetic retinopathy . I 'm sorry , I know you wanted to paint . I took bart and three buses to get here , dan . You don 't have to see to paint . It 's just that particular dream died with my son . I 'm sorry about christopher . He just disappeared ? Yes . He went out one night to meet a friend and never came back . Could he have run away ? He would never leave me . My eyes were going , he ... I understand if you don 't want to talk about it . I 'm sorry , I have a dentist appointment . What is it you want ? My son back . - You 've lost a child ? - Yes.Sorry. Never mind . I 'm sorry . Did christopher have any enemies ? No . But only a few friends . Someone who worked with you around that time . His name was dewey or something . He worked at senfel right around the time christopher disappeared . - Dewey . - Yeah . But what does all this have to do with your son ? Do you think the same person took them ? No.Not quite like that . tell me about dewey . Christopher used to spend hours hanging around the office , waiting for me to get off work . Dewey was young , christopher looked up to him . They loved computers . So what happened to dewey ? I don 't know . Started his own company , I think . Did quite well . There . Let 's see . Oh ... beautiful . Thank your aunt . - Thank you , aunt annette . - You are welcome , my dear . This comes from the finest children 's shop in hong kong , so don 't forget to tell all your friends . Oh , don 't give her any ideas , it 's competitive enough out there . One of the upsides of having a boy . So go for it . We were , but I don 't think it 's going to happen for awhile . Why not ? Not a good time . There 's still talk of layoffs at the paper . Oh , dan , could get work anywhere . The internet is where it 's all going , anyway . Yeah , but dan likes to get ink on his fingers . You sure it 's not because he works so much ? Maybe . Well ... ? Then pull the goalie from the net . Dan does want a boy . And , lately , I 've been thinking about it , too . I don 't know why . What 's a goalie ? Nice job . Have you heard of any of these people ? No . Were there other people garrity was investigating ? You got two more minutes . - Can I take this ? - No . You should really rethink that . All I really do is read energy . Okay . The future is nothing more than many little bits of the present strung together . So by reading your energy in the present , we can get a clearer picture of where you 're headed . The seven of wands . A time of great opportunity . This card says you 'll succeed at whatever you do . You know what , my husband is actually coming home soon , so ... katie , can 't rush this . It 's okay . You 're anxious . I understand . This last one is called a " significator . " This is basically the essence of the entire reading . Sorry . Uh-oh.What ? It 's a big card , that 's for sure . Something 's falling apart in your world . A situation under this roof , am I right ? There was an unfortunate event here about a month ago , yes . The hanged man is about being suspended . Your life has been turnedupside down . You wouldn 't be here if it wasn 'T . So I 'd call that a lucky guess . Something very profound is happening here . Something bigger than you or any of us . The challenge is that you have absolutely no control over it . So what should I do ? The cards don 't predict the future . They only illuminate . The answers are always within . georgina conrad , this is my brother-in-law , dan . - Hi . - You 're home . Oh , my god . I 've never felt anything like it . So , who is she ? A psychic .

How you talked to her in public sometimes . How you said you wanted kids , and then you didn 't , . but despite all that , I 'm still wondering .. if my sister married the right brother . She did . So ... what 's the deal with dan ? Is he gambling again ? No.He 's not gambling . Annette , he loves katie . He 's just , he 's on the road a lot . In fact , dan 's not even the most messed-up vasser of the week . Really ? Who is ? - Really ? - Yeah . Why ? I knocked up my girlfriend . thank you . Oh , your life is so over . It 's so strange that you live alone . Yes . In four different houses . Oh ... what are you gonna do ? I don 't know . You got any ideas ?

She 's losing her eyesight . Why do you think we crashed that night ? She 's not gonna be able to keep her job . She needs health insurance . Believe it or not , I still need it more . It 's just a camera . It 's not just a camera . It 's advanced technology , and people would kill to own it . I mean , why do you think someone 's willing to pay so much money for it ?

 Previously on Journeyman : n 't control when I go . I seem to come back to the present when I finish some chapter in the lives of the people that I 'm tracking . Who 's the lucky woman who got my fianc ? So if it feels like a dream , then maybe it 's something you 're doing to yourself . The MRI didn 't find anything , but maybe it 's something else . Katie , I 'm going back . I can feel it . Katie ? Yeah . Jack 's Katie ? Did he tell you he saw Livia ? It 's interesting . Don 't you think that whatever he 's doing takes him right back to her ? Do you come back dead ? I 'm not gonna die . I 'm doing some research . On what ? Tachyons . Tachyons ? Particles that travel faster than the speed of light . Katie ... Olivia knows what you do . Livia does what I do . Welcome back . I 'm not trying to break you and Katie up , Dan . You 're doing fine by yourself . Where you been ? What is that in your pocket ? And I 'm not in the mood for a punch line . Don 't worry . It 's ... You can 't keep going on like this , Katie . It 's complicated , Jack . DAN : What else ? Oh , we need lemongrass and artichokes and heirloom tomatoes . Lemongrass ? Yeah , I know . Mom 's decided that we can 't eat anything out of boxes or tubes anymore . What about ice cream sandwiches ? She stops those , we 're moving out . ( dog barks ) Sorry . Hey , look . Who 's he with ? Doesn 't matter . It 's Jack . She 'll be somebody else next week . ( chuckles ) Hey , Jack . Hey . What are you doing here ? Apparently , my diet 's lethal . Too many donuts , that it ? Time to let the holster out ? Oh , sorry . Theresa Sanchez , this is Katie , Dan . ALL : Hi . Nice to meet you up there . Jack talks about you all the time . Oh , really ? Well ... So , how 'd you guys meet ? In the ER . I 'm stitching a guy up while he 's taking a statement . Dream date . You know me . I 'm all about the romance . Oh , yeah , yeah . Cheese guy 's here . Oh , I love him . Oh , so cheese is okay , just not cheesecake ? ZACK : Awesome . Cool . How do they do that ? Practice , buddy . Can you do that ? No . Zack , listen to me . We got to go , all right ? Not yet ! We got to find Mom , all right ? Got to find Mom . Dad , my hat ! Dad ? ( thunder crashing ) My God . ( coyote howls ) You are awful ! Jack , you seen Dan ? No . He was just here . He 's pretty good at evaporating these days . Yeah . Zack 's with him . I can 't reach him on my cell . Take it easy . How far could he have gone ? I don 't know . Do you have any idea where they were heading ? No . I think Zack might be separated from his father . ( dialing ) Hey , it 's Vasser . I 'm at the corner of Collingwood and Market . I got a priority 807 . Don 't worry . We 'll find him . Is something going on ? My brother . ( thunder rumbling ) ( grunting ) Where 's my case ? ! What ? Black plastic case ! You know where we are ? I don 't even know when we are . TLF TLF TLF TLF TLF Katie ? Katie ? Where is he ? Upstairs . Where 'd you go , Dan ? I got sick . Vertigo or ... What , you fall into the bay ? Jack ... Why didn 't you call ? Jack , stop . Come on ! Lost his son in a public place , he can 't call his wife and tell her ? Look at him ! How can this be okay with you ? What the hell 's going on here ? Last week you had a handgun at a fundraiser . Jack , this is a family matter . Yeah , and he 's my brother . What the hell 's going on ? Jack ... Jack , we have a problem and it 's serious and it 's personal , and right now I just need you to trust me , okay ? Okay . Thank you . Wow , you , you 've made enabling an art form , Kate . Dan ... we got careless , both of us . Zack was terrified . He just ... How do we do this ... with you just vanishing ? I don 't know . Right now , I just got to go and talk to Zack , okay ? Yeah . Dan , clean up first . ( video game trilling ) I 'm sorry about leaving you today . Where did you go ? I-I got sick . Got dizzy and I lost you in the crowd . I thought you could see over people . I can usually . What 's this , bud ? I 'm making a sign for the ' Niners game so Mom can see us on TV . All right , yeah . Want to help me ? I 'd love to . Tomorrow after work , all right ? Okay . Really ? Dan ... I bought the tickets six months ago . I promised him we 'd go together . Well , things are a little different now . I know , but this doesn 't seem like the time to tell him that we can 't go . He 's seven , Kate . He 's not gonna understand any of this . Honestly , being seven might help . 1.5 % this quarter ? This month . Wait a minute . Down 1.5 points of circulation this month alone ? That 's a precipitous decline . Precipitous ? That 's a freefall , gentleman . John , what 's going on with the buyout of the senior reporters ? Everyone 's come forward . We 're gonna have to cut deeper . We 're pretty lean right now . We 're not lean enough . I see a whole lot of people running around out there . Yeah , doing their jobs . I don 't doubt that they are , Hugh . But you don 't care . And any additional cutbacks will leave us open to age and discrimination lawsuits . Oh , yeah , and weaken the paper . Here we go . You got to like a guy who 's got the bag to hijack a plane and bail out with a hundred grand . No , you really don 't . So why you looking him up ? Story . You got something on him ? Maybe . 'Cause that 'd be huge . Dylan McCleen 's just the name he brought the tickets under . Nobody knows who he really is . I know that , Jesse . You need any help ? What ? I 'm a floater . Research a tattoo for me : lightning bolt , star on the left , sun on the right . See what you can find . You got it . This newspaper 's bleeding , Hugh . Ad revenues are down 15 % for the year . Internet has decimated our classified section and we have some reporters here who only file a couple times a year . We 're not Vanity Fair . Newspapers are never profit machines , Lane . You want to make money , invent a search engine . And that 1.5 is better than last quarter . Which means we 're pulling out of our dive . What about Vasser ? What about him ? He works hard . And he 's expensive . Hey , you want to hurt this paper , get rid of Dan Vasser . I don 't want to hurt the newspaper . I want to keep it running . That 's an Army Ranger tattoo . You 're fast . 75th Regiment . Do you really think that Dylan McCleen was a Ranger ? Could be . Well , they did long-range recon in Vietnam , Cambodia , and Laos . Hasn 't every morsel been picked from that carcass ? Dan 's onto something new . Like what ? A lead . Who he was , or is . Really ? How much would you love that ? Quite a bit . Course , you have a better chance of getting a QA with Jimmy Hoffa , but surprise me . REPORTER : In Washington today , President Ford issued an Executive Order establishing a commission on Olympic sports . An avid sportsman , the President hopes to insure that America 's well-represented at the upcoming ... ( man speaks foreign language ) Can I come back ? Excuse me . ( speaks foreign language ) ( speaks foreign language ) How the hell do you keep finding me ? Who are you ? I 'm nobody . Are you Green Beret ? No . How did you know my landing zone ? I didn 't . I was just there . In the middle of the woods at night ? You 're special ops . No . I saw what you did out there . No one disappears that fast but us . Dylan ... That 's not my name . Why are you following me ? I have no idea . Who 's the guy in the picture ? You looking for him ? What ? You want money ? No . I want to help you . Why ? ! You follow me again ... Just gonna watch me get stabbed ? What do you want me to do , hurl myself onto his knife ? It doesn 't work like that . Oh , really ? Where 's Dad ? He 's working late , sweetie . He said he was gonna help me with the sign . I know he did , honey . He will . This new job of his , it 's real tough on him . On everybody . ( knocking ) Who is it ? ! SFPD . Sorry to disturb you , Mrs. Vasser . Wilson Hargraves , SFPD . Is everything okay ? We 're investigating a robbery at a liquor store the night of your fund-raiser . It 's a place a couple of blocks away . Hey , honey . Could you go upstairs and play for a few minutes ? Okay . Okay . Come on in . Thank you . DAN : Dylan McCleen . You haven 't heard of Dylan McCleen ? He 's the guy who ... He hijacked a plane . I told you I haven 't . What 's your problem ? Sorry . I 've been on the road a lot . It 's taking its toll on the family . Tell me about it . Do you have a family ? ( car horn honks ) No . Well , I do . I 've got a son . His name 's Zack . That 's nice . I 'm doing a lousy job of raising him . I keep get sucked out of his life at all the wrong times . Right now he thinks that I don 't love him . So . See ? No secrets with me . That 's hard . I 'm sorry . Two hot dogs , two sodas , please . You worried that I won 't be able to handle that you have a husband and family ? No , Dan . I know you can handle that . Why are you still here ? Why are you keeping an eye on me ? What are you doing here ? How are you gonna pay for lunch ? I thought so . It 's becoming a problem . I told you to buy old currency . It 's expensive . Katie checked it out . $ 2.95 . $ 2.95 ? It 's a miracle . Sticker shock . You were co-chair of the benefit at the museum ? Is that right ? That 's correct . I 'd love to see a guest list , if I could . I 'd rather not . We promise discretion to our donors . We promise to arrest people who commit armed robberies . Can I get that to you tomorrow ? You were at the event all night ? I was co-chair . Yes . And your husband ? He attended . You didn 't see anyone there with a gun , did you ? No . I never saw a gun , no . Okay . Well , um ... Listen , get me that list by tomorrow , if you can . Here 's my card . Well , I ... I really hope you get the guy . Oh , we have a half dozen witnesses , a cabbie who gave him a ride . a camera phone shot . I think we 'll find him . Can I ask you a question ? And I-I don 't mean to be flip . Sure . Did the owner of the store say it was a man in a tuxedo who robbed him ? I mean , isn 't that where you should start ? Well , the owner of the store was pistol-whipped within an inch of his life . He 's in a coma , so we can 't start there . You have a good night , Mrs. Vasser . Yeah . Look at me . Do you really think I 'd rob a liquor store ? No , but I didn 't think you 'd come armed to a black-tie fundraiser either . And people go to prison all the time for crimes they didn 't commit . It 's gonna be okay . How 's Zack ? He 's not great . Jack says he 'll take him to the game . You have to tell him that you 're not going , Dan . I will . I 'll do it tonight . How was your day ? Fine . I think I got a story on Dylan McCleen . The hijacker ? Yeah . You met him back there . Yeah . Can you imagine ? Uncovering the identity of Dylan McCleen . It sounds like you 're enjoying yourself . It has its adrenaline moments , that 's all . And the Livia part ? No . You 're an adrenaline guy , Dan . You liked the action when you were gambling . Maybe you want two women in different time zones . Katie ... No , I mean , you know , technically , it wouldn 't be cheating if it 's in the past . I was sleeping with Jack . Maybe you should sleep with Livia back there . So if I 'm with Livia back there , you can start sleeping with Jack here , right ? What ? Not funny ? ( sighs ) Honey , I 'd trade adrenaline rush for marital bliss any day . I know . Maybe if I just held onto you . We could try it . ( chuckles ) I 'm gonna go see Zack . Okay . I love you . * Johnny was a hoolboy * When he heard his first Beatles song * * " Love Me Do , " I think it was and from there * * It didn 't take him long * Got himself a guitar * Used to play every night * Now he 's in a rock ' n ' roll outfit * * And everything 's all right * Don 't you know ... * Johnny told his mama , " Hey , Mama , I 'm going away * * * Gonna hit the big time , gonna be a big star someday * Three dollars ' worth ? Right away , sir . Excuse me . A man is looking for you ; he 's a soldier . Does anyone speak English here ? Yes , sir . Not you . Can I , can I borrow your pen ? Hey , wait . Thanks . * Don 't you know that you are a shooting star ? * Captain Rich ? You speak English ? Is that his name ? ( speaking foreign language ) ( speaking foreign language ) Where are you going ? Where do you live ? New job in the Valley . We must leave now . Wait . I need to speak to you about Captain Rich . He leave me . He said he 'd help get my family here , but he did not . I wait long time for Captain Rich ; he no come . Captain Rich has been looking all over this city for you . I moved to Oakland . Now I move to Sacramento . I follow work . He has the money now to help your family . Please , please don 't leave . ( tires squeal ) ( door opens ) * Johnny looked around him * And said , " Well , I made the big time " ... * ( man speaking foreign language ) * Don 't you know ? * Don 't you know that you are a shooting star ? * My name is Choung Seng . Dan . * Pickin ' up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream ... * DAN : Do you know his first name ? CHOUNG : Captain Rich . My children call him " chaka chacout . " It means " crazy dog . " ( chuckles ) He gave me this . He helped me to escape , to come here . What happened to him ? I do not know . He was supposed to help get my family out of Cambodia . I never would have left without them , but ... he ... promised he could get them out and then he leave . Where is he now ? I don 't know . You do not know ? You said he was here . Where do you live ? How can I reach you ? Do you , you have a job ? I quit Pacific Dragon today . I have no job . Go back to Pacific Dragon , get your job back , and give me that medal . No . Please , I ... Please , I just ... I need it to help you . No . ( grunts ) I 'm sorry . Hey ! ( phone rings ) Good morning . I need to know all I can about an Army Ranger named Captain Rich- - Southeast Asia , Special Ops . Do you think this is McCleen ? Maybe . Uh , first name ? Don 't have it . Okay , that 's going to make it hard . Yeah , probably . HUGH : How 's Dylan McCleen coming ? I think I 'm onto something , Hugh . Like his identity ? Yeah . Can you give me another day ? We 've waited 32 years for this story . We can wait a day . Are you serious about this , Dan ? I think I 'm onto something , Hugh , and if it 's not , I 'll kill it . ( chuckles ) Can I help you ? You 're Dan Vasser . Yes . I 'm Elliot Langley from Lawrence Livermore . Oh . I was speaking at USF . I thought since I was in the neighborhood ... The apple doesn 't fall far from the tree , hmm ? ( chuckling ) : Yeah , uh , let 's go somewhere we can talk . So ... how do you know my father ? I had just started at NASA . Your father was covering the shuttle prototype . You had questions about tachyons ? You know , I 'm pretty sure we spoke on the phone once about ten , maybe 15 years ago . Really ? Yeah . Maybe I was looking for your father . Maybe . You have a very good memory , though . Look , I wasn 't entirely forthcoming . I 'm not doing a story on funding at Stanford . Is that right ? It 's not something I ... like people to know around here , but ... I 'm working on a book . It has a science fiction element . Time travel ? Yes . The rules haven 't changed much since Einstein . Ultimately , whether it 's wormholes or warp drives , time travel requires you to go 186,000 miles per second . The speed of light . That 's the rub because so far nothing has demonstrated an ability to do that . What about tachyons ? Theoretical particles , never proven to exist . So time travel is impossible ? No , just not proven . 500 years ago , we knew Pluto didn 't exist . Five years ago , we knew it was a planet . Now we know it 's not . Did Pluto change ? No . Did our understanding of Pluto ? Yes . You 're an expert , Dr. Langley . Do you think time travel is possible ? Until you prove to me you can or can 't , I don 't know . How does w doesotagonist get around ? I ... dabble in fiction myself . He just does . Actually , he wants to find a way to control it . Stopt . He claims to be bfalling throug randomly . Maybe a hoybe le . How terribly inconvenient . Yeah . Any idea what might be doing that ? Spontaneous symmet bsyreakage . Perturbation in the local dark energy density . God . Are people taking advantage of him ? Not yet . would be very valuable . Right ? Yeah , yeahI , guess . I hope I 've been somheenlp . You have . Yes . I should go . Let me know if you want to talk more about this . I will . Thank you . Do you validate ? Sadly , no . Well , then ... You 're good at this . You could do this for a living . Can you get us on the field after the game ? ( cell phone rings ) I don 't know if I can do that , bud . Why ? I 'm not sure that I can go to the game . What ? I got to work . But Uncle Jack 's gonna take you . You promised . I know , I know , Z. I got this big new project . I 'm sorry . ( phone rings ) ( phone beeps ) I 'll be two seconds , okay ? Hello ? JESSE : Not doing so well on Captain Rich . ( sighs ) : Wow , they said you were good . Okay , first of all , it 's Special Ops , so it 's not like there 's a facebook . And second , a first name would help . I 'll take anything , an address , medical record of any vet named Captain Rich living in San Francisco in the ' 70s . I don 't care if he was a chaplain . Aye , aye . ( phone beeps off ) Katie ... Katie ! Katie , I got to leave ! Hey . Hey . Sorry . Dylan ! That sucks . This assignment 's a bitch . They 're all a bitch . I just need a name . If I could only find McCleen 's real name , I could find him . What do you know about him ? He was Special Ops in Cambodia during the Vietnam War . I just need my laptop . Wait , Dan , listen . How did people survive back here ? What ? Dan . I know someone here you can talk to . A photojournalist covered the Vietnam War . No . Why not ? I thought I wasn 't supposed to mess with things . You 're not . Just get what you need and get out of there . He won 't know you . Dan ... let 's go visit your father . Vertigo ? That 's what he said . That 's usually an inner ear problem . How 's his hearing ? Dan 's ? Yeah . I think he hears fine . He just doesn 't listen . Well , they seemed really nice . Katie 's beautiful . Oh , yeah , Katie 's great . So , uh , how many dates are required for a full disclosure ? Normally , I 'd say 20 , but since you just brought it up ... I 'm gonna go with five . No , we 'll go with 20 . No , buddy , you don 't get to do that , open that door and then walk away . You were a woman . I 'm hurt that you could even consider that a possibility . I 'm a doctor . I know what 's possible . And you have delicate hands . I used to date Katie . Wow . Like , once or twice ? For a couple years . There 's nothing between me and Katie . And yet you felt the need to tell me that . Katie and I were over long before Dan stepped in . Oh , this is too good . Hi . Hi , it 's nice to see you again . You , too . So I hope I 'm not interrupting . Actually , I have to get back to work . Oh , no , please , don 't go . I 'm just dropping something off . No , really , I do actually have to leave . It 's a hospital . We never close . Thanks for lunch . Got it . I 'll see you later . See you . Bye . ( clears throat ) Niners tickets . Thanks for helping out . Sure . So , uh , I got to go . There 's a thing at Zack 's school . Okay . Good seeing you . Drop in on my next date . You couldn 't have given me a heads-up about the interrogation ? Oh , you met Hargraves . Yeah . He wanted to know how we were spending the booty . He 's just doing his job . So , you didn 't send him ? No . This is his investigation . I 'm Homicide . If the owner dies , you might see more of me . Jack , Dan didn 't do it . So , uh , Theresa . I like her . Yeah , she 's fun . But don 't get too comfortable . It might not last . Why ? You 'll laugh . What ? She doesn 't want to have kids . ( laughs ) Wow . You live long enough ... Um , so , when did you have this epiphany ? Not too long ago . It 's time . I just need a fertile Myrtle , and I 'm good to go . Someone who 'll order in Chinese with you and watch South Park ? Oh , please . I 'll die alone if I wait for perfection . That 's a good point . ( elevator bell dings ) You okay ? Yeah . Come on . LIVIA : You see him ? No . Hey , do you know where I could find Frank Vasser ? ( quietly ) : Thanks . How old were you when he left ? Zack 's age . Ooh . I got to go . Okay . Bye . Go , Dan . Frank ? Dan Carson , UPI . I 'm doing a story on war correspondents . Could I talk to you for a second ? Sorry , Ford 's in town . Got to get to the St. Francis . Take your pictures , meet deadline , then off to the Washbag to decompress , right ? Do I know you ? Herb Caen told me about you . Ten minutes . ( sighs ) Five . You can 't drop a half a million tons of bombs on a country just ' cause it 's next to Vietnam and not expect people to go crazy . Yeah , no kidding . We were over there when the Khmer Rouge rolled into Phnom Penh . Just teenage boys in red scarves yelling , waving guns around . It was , uh ... It was real ugly . How long were you there ? Four months . Had a hotel pool till a water buffalo died in it . Must have been hard on your family . Traveling comes with the job . You know , it puts a roof over their heads . There 's a soldier I 'm looking for . Army Ranger Special Ops guy . He was in Cambodia around that time . A Captain Rich ? You get a first name ? No . Well , if I knew a Captain Rich , I doubt he 'd tell me he was Special Ops . Those guys don 't talk about what they did over there . MAN : Vasser ! Yeah . What ? Your wife 's on the phone . Yeah , you know , just , uh ... just tell her I 'm not going to make dinner . I got to go . Okay . Thank you . Man , you , uh , sure you don 't mean Ritchie ? Sorry ? Captain John Ritchie , went into Cambodia . Worked on the Ho Chi Minh Trail . He got shot up over there . He was an Army Ranger . Where would I find him ? What 's going on ? Some broad just took a shot at Ford at the St. Francis . FRANK : Great . Thanks a lot . Do you know where this Ritchie might be ? Where he always is . JESSE : So , Dan has me looking for this guy who fought in the Vietnam War . He thinks that 's Dylan McCleen ? Maybe . There 's this one vets Message Board and Buddy Search that 's really good . Great . Bird-dog him . Well , uh , the board is for vets . Only . Oh , come on , Jesse . You must be a veteran of something . Sure , I could be . It 's a little misleading . Is it illegal ? No . It 's the kind of stuff I used to do as a blogger , but ... Look , are you going to be quoting anybody ? Cite them as a source ? Probably not . This is a big story . Don 't stop doing what got you hired . ( instrumental country music playing ) So , you 've got a hundred grand in walking-around money , and you drink in this dump . They track the serial numbers . ( pool ball clacking ) Have to be careful where I spend it . Choung must have quite a family for you to want to spend the rest of your life on the FBI 's Most Wanted List . How do you know his name ? I 'm a reporter . Tell me why you 're looking for him . ( chuckles ) ( sighs ) If I was gonna turn you in , I would have done it by now . I was wounded there . His family hid me , fed me . I promised him I 'd get him out . Couldn 't the government help you ? Nah . Everyone just wants to ... forget . Yeah , but hijacking a plane is ... Cambodia 's imploding , man . People are getting slaughtered over there . I needed money , and a bake sale wasn 't gonna cut it . So Choung didn 't know what you were doing . Hell , no . After I bailed out of the plane , they had a manhunt going for about six weeks . I laid low until they left . By the time I got to San Francisco , Choung was gone . He probably went to Cambodia to try to get his family out by himself , which means ... they 're all dead . Maybe not . * ' Twas in another lifetime * One of toil and blood * When blackness was a virtue , the road was full of mud * * I came in from the wilderness * * A creature void of form * " Come in , " she said * " I 'll give you shelter from the storm ...

It 's a little more complicated than that . Let 's just say I still have some infrastructure there . Well , good luck . I think this is where I get off . Hey , here . No , thanks . I only need 50 grand . Just don 't spend it all in one place . I don 't want the money . Fine . Let me buy your jacket . My what ? ( sirens blaring ) The place is crawling with cops . I don 't need to be answering a lot of questions . You can take it . You can take mine . What , and take the rap for your hijacking ? That 's got to be , what , 30 to life ?

Who says I 'm sitting on it ? ( elevator bell dings ) ( phones ringing ) Huh . ( line ringing ) MAN : Hello ? Professor Choung Seng ? CHOUNG : Yes . Professor Seng , this is Dan Vasser from the Register . I 'm doing a story on the Khmer Rouge . Oh . Yeah , I know . Uh , you had family there . Yes . Are they ... Are they still there ? I was one of the lucky ones . Really ? I got my family out . But the others ... This is kind of a bad time . Can I call you back ? Yes , of course . Um , I 'll call you tomorrow . Thank you . Your name again ? Uh , Dan . Okay , Dan . Good-bye . Good-bye . ( line disconnects , dial tone buzzes ) ( sighs ) Vasser ? Uh , Dan ? Where you going ? Home . I really got to see my son . No , you can 't . You got to stay here . What are you talking about ? I found Captain Rich . But actually , it 's Ritchie . Captain John Ritchie . He 's a former Army Ranger . In Cambodia from ' 68 to ' 73 . Expert parachutist . And , uh , oh , get this . In 1976 , he got caught in an airport in Bali with 12K in cash . Think he was taking a little vacation . ( laughs ) So , what 's he doing now ? He owns a custom motorcycle shop in Mission Viejo . Wife , couple of kids . ( exhales ) It 's a dry hole . What ? I already checked out Ritchie . He 's got an alibi for the day of the flight . He talked to FBI in ' 76 . Sorry . You sure ? Positive . Damn it . I said I 'd kill it if I didn 't have it . Problem ? No . Hello , there . Hello . Hi . You 're in a good mood . I love coming home . I just put Zack down , if you want to go say good night . I 'd like that very much . What 's that ? Football tickets ? Three . Let Jack keep the other two . How much did they cost you ? Don 't worry . I used some of our mad money . ( laughs ) Mad money ? Yeah . Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! Dan , where did you get all that ? I knocked off a liquor store . Dan ... Katie , Relax . Relax ? You had a gun . Now you have money . Tell me how any of that is soothing . It 's Dylan McCleen 's . The hijacker ? Mm-hmm . It 's a long story . Can I say good night to Zack , then I 'll tell you about it over a glass of wine ? Sure . ( exhales ) ( door opening ) I 'm awake . Hey . Guess what ? What ? We 're all going . ( sighs ) I 'm sorry I haven 't been around much lately . It 's okay , Dad . It 's not , but I 'm going to try to do better . It 's okay , Dad . I think it 's cool . You think it 's cool ? I saw it , Dad . What did you see ? You . What did you see , Zack ? You 're magic . TLF TLF

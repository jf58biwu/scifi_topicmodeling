Hold on . Just want to see right where you are here . Ok . Whoa , baby ! I think we 've found your sport . Ha ha ha . Mr. White : and this , ladies and gentlemen ... Is a basic outline of the story of dna ... And of the doctors watson and crick ... Who cracked the genetic code ... That controls all living things . And we now believe ... That genes don 't just control the way we look ... But also how we think , and how we act ... And how we feel . So , when people mess with mother nature ... Look out . Because pollutants can change us . And not just chemica I and biological ones ... Cultural ones as well . Perfectly good dna becomes a bunch of useless junk ... Carried from generation to generation . And , uh , as a case in point i 'd like you to meet ... A very special friend of mine . This is charlie . He 'd like to say hel lo , he 's a little shy . How you doin ' ? You don 't wanna come out ? No , i think you should . Ow ! Aagh ! Kids : ha ha ha ! Gotcha . Da-Dum ! Ew ! Gross ! Mr. White : oh , yes ... Gross , ooh , that 's right . This is what happens when you screw with the code ... And don 't tell your parents i said the word " screw " ... Please . Kids : ha ha ha . This is what happens when pollutants ... Contaminate dna . Let charlie be a warning . This could happen to us . You wanna end up with two heads ? Uh , no . Mr. White : i don 't think so . This can happen to all living things ... And in fact , it may be happening right now . Then why don 't t hey do something ? Why don 't they stop it ? Excellent question , wendy . " Why don 't they do something ? " Why don 't they stop it " ? Who is this " they " tha t wendy 's referring to ... I wonder , huh ? What do you think ? " They " is all of us . Right ? Ok , thank you . We 'll see you on wednesday . Keep working on your science fair projects . You play golf ? No . What 's goin ' on ? Nothing 's going on , i mean ... I was bored out of my mind . Noah ! Noah , do you have a se c ? I need to talk to you about this . Yeah . I 'm outta here , dude . Just relax , noah , it 's ok . It 's not about the tes t ... It 's about thi s . Um ... Hey , did you , uh , did you draw this ? Yeah . Ok . Uh , what w as your inspiration ? I mean , where did you come up with this desi gn ? I was just scribbling . I do it all the time . And i 've got a whole bookful . May i ? Here are a few of ' em . That is incredible . My favorite one ... There 's a few . Mm . Beautiful . Do you know wh at these are call ed ? No . They 're actual ly called mandalas . Have you ever seen one before ? Mandalas . No . Never ... Heard of one or seen . Noah , would it be all right ... If i borrowed these for a little while ? Borrow all you want . Heh .

From my dream . Larry ... Hey , noah ... You know what time it is ? Yeah , i know , it 's late , b ut ... You gotta see this . What is this ? I mean it 's way past your bedtime , bud . It 's uh ... what is that ? It 's part of my exhibit for the science fair at school . It 's amazing , how did you do that ? It was easy . First i discovered that spiders are sensitive to sound waves ... And seem to move when they hear various frequencies . Then i experimented with the frequencies ... To make them move in specific patterns . I calculated their movements with my computer ... And i re-Programmed them . Their circular webs started changing ... Into something more elongated . I call it ... The structured bridge . This geometric design is extraordinarily strong ... And would be equal to a beam that could hold ... 1,000 pounds per square inch . Did he do this on his own ? Did you help him ? No , he 's done it all by himself . He 's just , sort of , taken off all of a sudden . You know , in the last month or so . His sister is highly gifted too . Mm . No , no , no , no . This is more t han highly gifted ... This is genius . He 's gonna win the national science fai r . ... that exist today , a bridge of this type ... Could span the entire solar system . Are there any questions ? " ' Twas brillig and the slithy toves ... " Did gyre and gimble in the wabe ... " All mimzy were the borogoves ...

We found her on the beach . Noah thinks she 's from outer space ... But he doesn 't really know . Outer space . Do you believe in aliens ? Aliens ? Like flying saucers and things like that ? Yeah , i guess i do , sort of . Noah does too . Oh , well ... boys . Mm-Hm . Do you think alien s would ever come he re ? Some people think they might be here right now ... And we don 't even know it . Really ? Mm-Hm . But what do they want ? I don 't know . Noah doesn 't know if they 're good or b ad ... If they wanna help us or kill us ... Or maybe steal our brains . Steal our brains ? Hmm . If i show you something ... Promise you won 't tell ? Oh . Like ... a secret ? Really ? Cool ! what kind of secret ? I can do a magic tri ck with my hand . Really ? Yeah .

I mean , something is just not right . What 's not right ? Look , we got two special kids ... With great minds , imaginations , its ... No , you 're not getting it ! You know , i 'm scared . I ...

Could have a moment or two alone , please ? Hey , go finish breakfast , sweetie . I ... guess . Sure . Whatever . Ha ... Is everything ok ? Yeah . Something is going on with your son ... And i 'd like to talk to you about it . Ever since the science fair ... But really even before that . Yes , i know , i ... I 've been feeling the same thing . There 's something i 'd like to show you . Uh , what is this ? Uh , this is a tibetan painting . It 's called a mandala . It 's a symbolic representation of the universe . This one 's actually almost 1,000 years old . Well , it 's ... beautiful ... But why are you showing it to me ? These were drawn by your son . Noah drew these ? Amazing . When i saw noah 's drawings ... They really struck a chord . Now especially this one ... Which is particularly rare . Yeah , this is actually an astrological configuration . The books says it 's a map to the past and future . Um , in tibet , uh ... They believe that there are extraordinary children ... With this very special knowledge ... And ... And abilities . Uh , they are considered actually very rare souls . Very gifted , like noah . They 're called tolkus . Mm , and then they even have a particularly ... Uh , specific means of identifying these children ... Markings , on their hands . Palm readers can look at their lines ... And tell if they 're one of these special beings . We met some of these kids and i actually had the honor ... Of being able to look at their palms , which was ... Naomi studied with a palm reader for several years . She 's really ... She 's quite good . Larry ... Thank you . No , i mean you are . Well ... You 're very gifted . So ... Can she look at mine ? Honey , what are you doing here ? I couldn 't help it , i ... I wanted to look . will you ? Uh , well i ... I 'm not actually an expert ... Mom , please . Uh ... I 'm sorry ... I just don 't believe in all of this stuff . I know it sounds really weird ... But there are many cultures ... That take this very seriously . ok . Let 's see . Do you see anything ? This is a very good hand . Really . This is what lamas would call auspicious . Meaning that you will have a very good life . But is it special ? It 's very special in its own way . It 's just not what i was , uh , talking about before . What about mine ? Um ... Would ... Ah ... Ok . What is it ? What 's wrong ? Huh , this is a ... A very special hand . Do you see how simple the lines are ? Mm . I 've never seen anything ... So pure . What does it mean ? It means you have a remarkable child . Do you have a copy machine ? We need to find some way to document this . Maybe we could show it to some people ? Uh , no , sorry , i don 't . Mom , sure , you do . No , i 'm sorr y . Look , uh ... I , just ... This is all starting to feel ... Too strange for me . It 's been so strange for both of us as well . I 'd just like you to st op . Thank you for your time . We should go , i think . Thanks . That 's a very cute bunny . She 's mimzy , she 's my teacher . She teaches me everything . She taught me about the painting and the book . She told me it was called the 7 mountains . My daughter has a very active imagination . Heh . Oh , come on . That 's not what it 's called , is it ? ... the recent mysterious blackout ... Are now zeroing in on seattle ... As the likely source . And in other news , 40 are dead ... Hey , why don 't you , uh , come to bed ? No , i ... I 'm not tired . Oh . You gotta ... You gotta stop thinking about this stuff ... You really do . No , i can 't ! David , the lines on their hands ... I 've never noticed them before . All right , look , w ... W ... I mean , what do you know about palmistry ? This woman , she could 've told you anything . How would you know ? Emma knew the painting ! She knew what it was called . It 's just not possible . I mean , i think you 're just making way too much out of it . Oh , david , you said that we 'd get help n ow . All right , what are we gonna tell a doctor ? Our kids have funny lines in their hands ... And they make weird drawings ? I just don 't ... I don 't buy any of this stuff , you know . I don 't understand . What do you mean ? But i don 't want the world to end ... Ever . I love the world . I don 't want it to die . I know . I know . With all my heart . I love you so much . Good morning , everybody . Jo : hey . Emma : morning noah : hi . Jo : can i get you something ? No , no . No . No . I got it . I got it . It 's fine . Dad , you 're eating breakfast at home .

You know , stop it with this mimzy stuff . Ok , here 's what i 'd like you to do . I 'd like you to just ... Put mimzy away , put the rabbit away , all right ? So that we can have a really great breakfast together . Emma , put the rabbit away . What is wrong with this family ? I mean it 's not ... Look , i want you to put the rabbit away , ok ? All right ? Just ... Could you pass the sugar ? Ahh ... Dad , you don 't need that much sugar ! And all of a sudden , i kid you not ... The sugar starts to rise by itself ... Up , it forms this pattern , and it comes over ... And all of it lands in my bowl . Now , i look at her and she 's just smiling . Very , very peacefully , just looking at it . And , i mean , wh-What is this ? This is so far out of my league . I ... I 've heard of ... Psychokinesis being practiced by advanced meditators before ... But i always thought it was just a metaphor . No , come on , this is not a metaphor ... We 're dealing with , it 's way beyond metaphor at this point . It 's not ... And i 'm sorry that i was ... Just so dismissi ve the other day . It was just that all of this is so beyond ... And we ... We just don 't know where to turn . So we called you because we thought that ... Maybe it could be rela ted to noah 's drawings ... And the painti ngs in the book . Uh , w ... We just don 't know what to do . I have a friend , arnie rose .

I 've gotta show you something . Mmm . Why are you showing me that ? It 's about alice ... Going through the looking glass . I think it explains what the machine is . Noah : wait a minute . That looks like mimzy . How could she have mimzy ? That was 100 years ago . Maybe she has spinners too , noah . Maybe she didn 't get what she was supposed to do . Maybe she needed a brother like you . Like me , what for ? Because you 're my engineer . What do you me an , your engineer ? I mean i can 't do it all alone , noah . Noah , i have to look . Emma ?

I 'm ok . I think she was dreaming . She must 've fallen out of bed . It wasn 't dreaming , and i didn 't fall out of bed . I looked through a looking glass , mommy . I looked through it , just like alice . What did you see ? A strange scientist . It was scary . Know what ? I 'm gonna put you back into bed . David : good night , noah . Oh , david ! Mr. And mrs . Wilder , let me explain this to you . We are born with over 100 billion brain cells . The connectors are called synapses ... And by the time a child reaches the age of 3 ... Its brain has formed about 1,000 trillion of them . But then , as we become adults ... We lose over half of them . And the brain becomes rigid or hard-Wired . All their potential brain power gets reduced ... Narrows down ... And specializes . But your children are different . This is an image ... Of a child 's brain , age 2 . This is an adult 's brain . And , in particular , this is emma 's . Now , not only is her development ... Completely off the charts ... But this section ... Is all new growth . Now the red and orange areas ... Indicate significant brain activity . What 's so amazing is that we were able to see changes ... In the time in between the different images . Now , there 's nothing ... In the literature that addresses this . So , i 've spoken to my colleagues ... And we would like to schedule some more tests ... As quickly as possible . If that 's ... all right with you . Oh , i ... I don 't know . I ... I just can 't believe this . Hey . Hey . Oh , what are you doing home ? It 's not even 4 o ' clock . I 've , uh taken a leave of absence from the firm , jo . Indefinite . Two weeks , maybe more , as long as it takes . I talked to the guys , told ' em we have ... Some family problems ... And they seemed ok with it . So ... here i am . Oh , here you are . Thank you . Are you sure ? I am absolutely sure . Emma : daddy , daddy ! Hey . Hey , dad , you 're home ea rly . Heh heh . Hi . Daddy ! C 'mere . C 'mere . David : how you doin ' ? That 's my package pickup . Thanks ! Oh ! Ah ! What 's going on ? What 's going on here ? Terrorism task force , stand back . Take everybody into the living room . Get away from her ! Who 's in charge ? ! I wanna speak to who 's in charge ! You 'll have plenty of ti me to talk , trust me . Jo : who are you ? Why are you doing this ? His name is broadman , mommy . Who told you that ? We have a right to know what we 're being accused o f . What 's this about ? You 're being held for reasons of national security ... Under the patriot act . But we haven 't done anything ! We know about the power outage , where it originated . I need to get something . Ok , you go with her . Yes , sir . And i 'd like to know if you have a search warra nt . I got probable cause , i don 't need a search warrant , sir . Mom , i 'm sorry . Look . I want everybody outta here right now ... And into the vans . Let 's get this shut down . Let 's go . All right , you heard him , let 's g o . Daddy ... Now , go ! Get your jackets , it 's pretty chilly outside . Where they taking us , daddy ? Noah : what 's going on ? Emma : where we going ? Mrs. Wilder ! Is everything all right ? Emma : who are these people ? Where we takin ' them ? Not to jail , that 's for sur e . Look , seal this place of f , go through everything . Bring me anything that looks suspiciou s . Yes , sir . Go . I want them inside . Let 's go . The 4 of you follow me . Are we good ? This way . Let 's go . Mr. Broadman 'll be in in a moment to talk to you . What 's going on here , noah ? What did you do ? Sweetheart , what aren 't you telling us ? I didn 't know ... I didn 't know what it could do . I ... Didn 't mean ... You didn 't know what what could do ? Th ... The machine , the generator . Jo : the generator ? You guys , be quiet , they 're probably listening ... To everything we 're saying . Just ... What generator ? I made it with the toys . Whoa , whoa , whoa , play that last part ba ck . The machine , the generator . The generator ? You guys , please , be quiet , they 're probably listening ... To everything we 're saying , just ... What generator ? I made it with the toys . What generator ? What toys ? Yeah , we got that from the break room fe ed . Now , the next one is a selection from the teacher . Dave , can you give me the teacher ? I ... I don 't know anything about any continuation ... Or terrorist cells or anything . I 'm just a science teacher . I promise you , that 's all i do . I just ... I teach science , i went to nepal once ... But ... that was just for a vacation . This next one is the babysitter . Dave . She ... She made her hand dissolve ... Into a billion pieces ... Just ... Just ... Like that , i mean ... It wasn 't natural , that 's ... That 's not natural , right ? I mean ... She 's an alien . I think they all are . am i the only one here ... Who doesn 't have a clu e to what 's going on ? Thank you . We just have a few questions . Um , could you tell us what these are ? Those are nothing . They 're just ... toys . What about this ? That 's ... just a toy too . What are these ? Those are spinners . Would you ask her to keep back ? I 'm not dangerous . I can show you . Uh , it 's just a magic tric k . Mimzy showed me how to do this . Mimzy . Is that mimzy ? Can we see your bunny ? No ! We won 't hurt it . No ! Emma : i want her ! Jo : it 's ok . Give mimzy back ! David : broadman ! That 's a child 's toy . What are you doing ? It 's not like anything i 've ever seen . Let 's do a slice and scan right away . Sweetheart . Oh , boy . Broadman , explain what 's going on . I don 't know what 's going on you said it was magic . What kind of magic is that ? What 's ... Why ... Where are they taking it ? How long is it gonna take ? What are they doing ? It 's not gonna take that long . Just be patient . Emma : bring her back now ! Noah : what 's going on in there ? Ok , here 's the slice . Are you getting this ? It 's extraordinary . It 's almost as if this thi ng could alive ... Like it 's mimicking g the nervous system . I 'm gonna take it down another level . I wanna go deeper . You 're pushing the limits here steve . It will start breaking up . Just a bit more . Whoa ! Whoa ! Stop ! Look at that . What is it ? You guys see what i see ? Look , i 've been at intel for more than two decades . I know every nanotechnology project ever initiated . All of them . And we 've dreamed about this . We 've dreamed about creating artificial life . It would be amazing , we 'd change the world . But we are eons away ... From achieving anything like this . Eons . All right , let 's recap what happened ... At least the best we can . We know these things , these ... objects ... Are made from technology that no one here 's ever seen before . And somehow they have a intel logo ... Etched in their molecules . We know that there was a major power outage in half the state . We know ... or at least we think we saw ... A little girl atomize her arm . Does anybody have any thoughts on this ? Emma : can i talk ? Mimzy 'd like to speak to you . She wants to speak ? Where ? She 's in the other room . She 's telling me what to say . The people in the future can 't travel through time . They need our help . Something in them is broken . And we can fix it . We have what they need . She says it 's in our genes . Our genes ? They 've been sending other mimzys into the past ... To look for it . But none of them have come back . She says she is the last one . I 'm sorry , th ... This is crazy . Hold it , please let her finish . Emma : she says people can 't travel through time ... 'Cause they 'll die ... So they built dolls to do it ... Like mimzy . But she won 't be here much longer . She 's disintegrating . Mommy , we have to send her back right away . She says everybody is dying . Ok , that 's it . Please , just let her finish . She 's done . I want more expert brought in on this thing . On this there are no experts . Emma 's voice : noah , can you hear me ? I need you . I need you to help me . em , where are you ? Emma : noah , don 't talk . I don 't wanna wake anyone . Noah 's voice : do you hear me ? Emma : see , you can do it too ! Noah : it 's like walkie-Talkies . Emma : better . We need to get the spinners and the generator . Noah : there 's a camera . What do we do ? Emma : use your spider speak , noah . Noah : right . Got it . Em ... Took care of the cameras . I can unlock the door , noah . It 's locked . The spinners are breaking . We need more . We don 't have more . Yes , we do . On whidbey . Under the bed . I can see them . Well , what good is that gonna do us ? Come on , we have to hurry . Emma : there it is . Come on , noah . Let 's go . You have to drive us to whidbey . I can 't drive . Yes , you can . Just like phantom racer . You can do it . Come on , let 's go . Whoa ! what 's that ? This is a lot easier than phantom racer . Please drive carefully . What 's wrong ?

 Something wasn 't right . that 's how I felt . I felt compelled to cheer for the losing team . I had the feeling that Haruhi was about to cause a commotion again ... What in the world ... the phone . You don 't have to tell me . right ? We 're all meeting in front of the station at exactly 2 o 'clock . Make sure you come ! I didn 't even get to say a thing . What ? I forgot to tell you what to bring . Bring your swimming gear and lots of money ! And make sure you come on a bike . Over ! I had the feeling that I knew exactly what Haruhi was going to say . that 's not right . it felt like the same thing had happened not too long ago . Is this what you call déjà vu ? huh ? 232 ) } Endless Eight Kyon ! You need to show more enthusiasm ! yeah . I came for you . thank you . let 's go ! Where to ? of course ! so I guess we would . we should have summer activities like other people do in the summer ! you know ? That 's why we 're doing this now ! This is our once-in-a-lifetime freshman summer vacation ! Kyon and Koizumi-kun . We 're counting on you guys to get us to the pool . I wouldn 't ask ... But what are you counting on us for ? We 're going on your bikes . check timing . It was held too long and joined up with the next line } Take that ! Restrain yourself ! { I can 't make out exactly what she says ? Southrop } Can 't she read the signs that say " No Diving " ? Hurry up and get in ! The water 's nice and warm ! Take that ! It looks like fun . Don 't you think Suzumiya-san may have found a normal way of enjoying things ? Is inviting people by calling them up all of a sudden and then hanging up on them after stating her one-sided demands ... considered " normal ? There 's no time like the present . She wanted to do this now ... Does that mean we drew something better than " bad luck ? " { TL Note : The Japanese phrase 思い立ったが吉日 literally means " the day on which something is thought of is the auspicious day . " Kyon is referencing the idea of drawing a fortune to determine one 's luck or " omikuji . " } { Time this TL note please . - Ky . } Kyon is referencing the idea of drawing a fortune to determine one 's luck or " omikuji . But it 's quite peaceful now . Seeing her having so much fun there shouldn 't be anything happening that will endanger the world . What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's probably just my imagination . We 've been through a lot since spring . I think I might have become a little neurotic . So close ! One more time ! Good ! This tastes the best ! this should be a " pool for the masses " instead of a " pool for the public . " Why would Haruhi choose a place like this ? It 's that weird feeling again . I have the feeling that I 've seen this scene somewhere before . Nagato seems bored . Kyon ! That 's right . Then Haruhi said something like ... These two are my brigade members . They 'll listen to whatever I say . So ask them anything ! Okay . Now let 's go have fun ! We 're going to play water soccer . okay . I guess déjà vu happens all the time . but ... What do you think ? What 's this ? It 's a plan for how to pass what little remains of summer vacation ! Whose plan is it ? Ours . When I suddenly realized that there were only two weeks of summer vacation left I was horrified ! It just feels like there 's still so much to do . we don 't have any time left . From now on we 're going all out ! We 're doing all this in less than 2 weeks ... is there anything you want to do ? I would like to scoop up goldfish . Okay . Goldfish ... scooping . Excuse me . Thanks . We 'll start tomorrow ! I wonder if there 's an Obon festival being held near here . A fireworks show would be nice too . at least . I 'll look into it . I 'll contact you later on . Koizumi-kun ! You 're dismissed for today ! Nagato . but ... How have you been feeling lately ? Been doing fine ? I 'm fine . That 's great . Yes . um ... Sorry for stopping you . That 's it . Why ? Why did I call out to her ? and suddenly found an Obon festival happening the next day . So this is the kind of celebration found in this era . There 's quite a crowd here . so check it . - Ky } Mikuru-chan ! They have the goldfish scooping that you wanted to do ! Let 's scoop them and break them as much as we can ! Breaking them isn 't a good idea ... You 're interested in these things ? Which do you want ? It 's fine . This one . Thanks . That 'll be 800 yen . so paying for that would 've been fine ... We got a big catch today ! we just took one each . Right ! Fireworks are next ! Let 's do that to finish today off ! Do you know what the word " tired " means ? then I guess they are . She 's doing crazy things . you get summer vacation . but there was one thing bothering me . We 'll go bug catching tomorrow . but have you finished your homework ? What 's with you ? You can do all of that in three days . Three days ? ! it is beginning of the next line so ... } That 's the right way to enjoy summer vacation ! Why the hell is this girl so smart ? The distribution of attribute points is really unfair . we 're going bug catching tomorrow . The one who catches the most bugs will ... Let 's see get to be the brigade leader for the day ! Screw that prize ! That sounds like fun . Will any bug do ? Um ... Cicadas only ! That 's right . It 'll be the SOS Brigade Cicada Catching Competition ! The next day was ridiculously nice . But ... the winner was Haruhi . We should go with a " catch-and-release " mentality after all . they might return the favor in the future . it would truly have the intelligence of a common bug . Here ! Go back to the mountains ! check timing since I added this in - Nazo } our brigade leader found us a part-time job . Here you go . Here . Gimme one ! Here you go . Thanks ! but overlaps a little with the previous line I think } It 's like some kind of endurance contest disguised as a part-time job . the job 's pay is Mikuru-chan 's frog costume ! I 've wanted this for a while now ! The manager said he 'd give it to us because of Mikuru-chan ! You made us do all that work just for the sake of getting that ? ! Let 's decorate the clubroom with it in commemoration ! just wear it whenever you feel like it . I give you permission ! Damn ... Yeah ? { Don 't need this line . - Ky } Hello ? Asahina-san ? It 's me ... I-I-If this goes on ... I-Is this really Asahina-san ? Koizumi . Why the hell are you with Asahina-san right now ? A slight problem has occurred . in fact . This is what we would call an " emergency " . Sorry for calling you out at night . Asahina-san ? I 'll kill you . Kyon ... { I took out a Ehhhh from before and added the * sniff * . Feel free to re-time it and take out the * sniff * - Ky } I ANT O GACCK TO AA FEWTA ! I use * classified information * to communicate with the future and have done * classified information * . so it was strange . That 's what I thought ... And then * classified information * . so I tried a * classified information * but it was completely * classified information * . W-What should I ... Are you just using the term " classified information " to censor words ? it 's like this . We are currently looping through the same time period over and over again . Huh ? it 's from August 17th to August 31st . The time after September 1st has completely disappeared . So it 's only natural that Asahina-san can 't go back to the future . { XMtS : She just needs more jiggwatts } There 's no such thing as a future anymore . What part of physics argues that a state of " no future " is natural ? Who the hell would believe that ? would believe it . check timing - Nazo } but there 's never been a test for it . So what exactly is the cause ? You really don 't understand ? I don 't want to understand . It 's Suzumiya-san . but ... there might be a part of her that thinks : " I don 't want summer to end ! Probably . What the hell ? Does she have some sort of regret ? I believe so . It may very well be the fact that she feels like she still has something to do during the summer . meaningless issue into galactic proportions . I 've finally figured out the reason behind the feelings of déjà vu we 've been having . You too ? maybe everyone in the world also ... it doesn 't seem like it . It seems that just by being people who are close to Suzumiya-san we become the only people who are able to feel this . I 'm thinking that there must be someone who has retained all of his or her memories from the repetitions . And who would that someone be ? { XMtS : changed from " And who is that someone ? " } don 't you ? Is it true ? Yes . Do you remember everything ? Yes . how many times has this repeat thing been going on for ? five hundred and thirty-second time . 532 times ? what are you saying ? Are you serious ? Yes . So we did the same thing over and over again each and every one of those times ? That is not necessarily the case . 532 iterations 391 of those times . we went twice . Obon minus the goldfish catching occurred 437 times . 056 times . there have been six variations ... Besides distributing balloons answered calls - No ! That 's enough . 532 times . That 's what Nagato said . about 595 years . reliving it over and over again while retaining her memories ? { XMtS : is it just me or does Kyon look a little like Shirou from Fate Stay Night right here ? } just how does it feel to have lived through all this ? I 've heard something ridiculous again . The next day was stargazing . The venue was Nagato 's apartment . but ... anyway ? I wonder . this problem will be relatively straightforward to solve . Why don 't we try this out for starters ? Suddenly hug Suzumiya-san from behind and whisper into her ear the words : " I love you . And who 's doing that ? I wonder if there 's anyone more suitable than you . My turn ! I invoke the right to veto . Shall I do it instead then ? I 'm just kidding . I 'm not qualified for that role . I would only put Suzumiya-san into an unnecessary state of confusion . The queue of vigorous summer vacation events continued . { from here to line 294 i cant figure out what goes where - chief } We went to a real fireworks show . We even took part in a Goby fishing event . and karaoke . We were always on the move . yet I didn 't make an effort to do something about it . the remaining days of summer drained away realistically . it was already August 30th . we 've pretty much completed our summer plans . I wonder if it 's okay like this ? But ... I guess that 's it . do any of you want to do anything else ? fine then . so it 's probably enough . it 's not . You aren 't supposed to be satisfied yet . let 's call it a day then . so just take a good rest until then . Please re-time this . I timed it myself since the timing was eff 'd up . - Ky } Haruhi ! I-It 's this feeling again . It 's never been this strong before . It must be the weight of all those ten thousand something repeats . I can 't let Haruhi go home like this . Or else these two weeks will repeat again ! But what should I do ? There should be hints in Haruhi 's words ! What are they ? What are they ? What are they ? Try and remember ! You have to remember ! Something that bothered me . Something that even concerned me . Haruhi 's going to go home ! I can 't let that happen ! Nothing will change if that happens ! What did we want do all this time ? What did we not manage to do ! ? I don 't have time to think ! I have to try something ! Say something ! Just say it ! My homework ... ISN 'T FINISHED YET ! That 's it ! My homework ! What 're you talking about ? I haven 't done a single bit of my summer homework ! my summer won 't end ! Are you an idiot ? Koizumi ! Have you finished yours ? so it 's the same for me . Then let 's do it together ! right ? please come as well ! but where ? We 'll do it at my place . Bring every single page of notes and every question you have ! We 'll settle this once and for all ! We 'll completely finish off all our summer homework ! Nagato and Koizumi ! We 'll pull this through to the end ! All right ! Then let 's start tomorrow morning ! We 'll cram it into the entire day ! Hold your horses . Don 't you dare decide things on your own ! I 'M THE BRIGADE LEADER ! These matters require MY opinion ! Kyon ! Taking matters into your own hands is a SERIOUS VIOLATION OF THE BRIGADE CODE ! I 'm coming too ! Looks like I hit the jackpot . Suzumiya-san is a talented person with both the pen and the sword . I think she 's been that way ever since she was little . That 's why she doesn 't even think of summer homework as a burden . That 's also why she probably never even thought of sharing the work with her friends . but ... who was also experiencing the same thing . The scariest thing was that Nagato wasn 't with us . but I think she was pretty tired as well . It feels like a lie . To think that we went through the second half of August ten thousand something times . It 's not surprising you feel that way . 531 repeats were in the worst possible situation . were the only ones who managed to return to the normal flow of time . Want to play some poker ? sure . by the way . Then we 'll just play without stakes . But I think I got the hint . were probably a parting gift from all the other mes from the previous iterations . Whatever I have now is all thanks to the us from the two weeks that came before . it would have been as if their entire summer was all in vain . Do you need to change ? No . Me neither . If I could repeat today ... I would have to remember to bring my entire life savings with me .

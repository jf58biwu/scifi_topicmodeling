 My brother Joseph and I have had two families . The first one ... Let 's just say it didn 't work out too well . But over the years , we made ourselves a new one . And it was to this family , all of you , that his heart really belonged . You see ... A family is something that Joseph and I needed . It offered us protection from the outside world ... A world that never understood or appreciated what makes us different . There are others like us out there ... in the shadows , in the light . Each grasping for meaning in a world that won 't accept who they really are . They , like us , are blessed , gifted with extraordinary abilities . And they , like us , struggle with finding their place in an ordinary world . Haunted by their past ... from those who would harm them and keep them from their destiny . Every one of them deserves a chance to be who they really are . But to what end ? For what purpose ? Here in this place , we offer salvation . We offer hope . We offer redemption . And one by one , they will come to our side , to our family , and they will find their way home . And all who have gathered will be strong . And all who have gathered ... will stand in unison . I say it 's time we found our way back home again . Find your way home , brother . - You must be my new roommate . - I guess I am . I 'm Claire . Hi . I 'm Annie . It 's nice to finally meet you . You too . The school wouldn 't send any information . I would have friended you on Facebook . That 's my fault . I always check those little privacy boxes for some reason . I did that same thing with my AP classmate 's profile after I got a B-plus in AP Physics . No , I 'm not in advanced placement . I got my G.E.D. It 's not because I dropped out , I was just traveling . You got in with a G.E.D. ? What do your parents do ? My mom breeds championship show dogs , and my dad works for the government . So that 's how you got in with a G.E.D. No , I just got really good scores . You 'll probably place in Fenton 's linear algebra class then today . Today ? He only takes 35 students a semester , and the placement test is at 1 : 00 . You get in and it sets the whole dominoes into motion . So , what 's your plan for graduate school ? I don 't really have one . Guess it 's kind of why I 'm here . You have to go to college with a plan . - How will you map your future ? - You have a map of your future ? See , I call this my trajectory . This is me in three years , graduating Magna Cum Laude in poli-sci pre-law . This is me in eight years , Massachusetts Attorney General . And this is me in 12 years , the youngest governor in U.S. history . You really thought that through . Don 't you think it 's time you put childish things behind you and thought this through yourself ? Don 't let G.E.D. be a lifestyle choice . Tell you what . If you want , I 'll help you make your own trajectory . It can be our project . Sounds great . Dispatch , this is Unit 5-9 . We are 12 blocks out . We 're on it . On it ? We 're not going anywhere in this mess . You 're right . - What are you doing ? - I 'm gonna hoof it . We 're 12 blocks away . You 'll never make it . Hesam , I grew up out here . There 's always a shortcut . Hi . I 'm here to save you . Roomie . Sorry . I 'm so excited . If you pass this test , we 're gonna be in class together . You and I will keep each other on our tippy toes . But ... Don 't think of this as a competition . This is about sisterhood . Sisterhood . This is a placement test for Linear Algebra 170 . 35 of you geniuses will be lucky enough to get in this class . The rest ; you can try next semester . You each have 45 minutes to solve this equation . Please show your work . - Is this a joke ? - I know , it 's so easy . Are you sweating ? No , it 's just a little hot in here . Where are you going ? This class isn 't for me . There he is . So that pregnant woman ? Heard she delivered twins . Named them both Peter . The pregnant woman 's name is Kristy . And she had twin girls . Haylie and Katie . They 're still up in neonatal . You know , you should stop by . - They 'd like to thank you in person . - I 'm good . What ? You single-handedly saved three lives . - I 'd be floating on cloud nine . - I am . You could have fooled me . What 's going on with you ? If I showed up 30 seconds later , they 'd be dead . It 's too close , man . I 've gotta be faster . You got there faster than humanly possible . If I was religious , I 'd think it was a miracle . A miracle ? - Catch you tomorrow . - Hang on . Where are you going ? - Took on a shift . - We just got off a double . I know , but James is sick . I figured I 'd cover for him . Too late , Jackson 's already covering . There 's a life outside this place . Me and some of the guys are going out , Houlihan 's still open , - come with us . - I 'm good . I 'll see you tomorrow . Have fun . See you tomorrow . I take it you 've seen the paper this morning . All four worked in Building 26 , Danko 's men . These are revenge killings . And we both know it 's Tracy Strauss . It won 't be long before she makes her way up that list to me . Or Nathan . So you 'll stop dragging your feet and pull the trigger on this operation . It 's been six weeks , Noah . I 've given you time to put your personal life in order . And Nathan says you 're avoiding his phone calls . By Nathan , you mean Sylar , right ? We 've been over this , Noah . It 's all working exactly as planned . As planned ? What plan ? We had no other choice . Matt Parkman had to turn Sylar into Nathan , and as I recall , you were in on it . I made an emotional decision . I didn 't want to see you lose your son , but it was wrong . For 50 years , the Company avoided emotions for good reason . I can barely look him in the eye knowing who 's under that skin . Then don 't . Just do your job to get the company up and running . You 're supposed to be the man with the plan , remember ? I 'm not sure I 'm that guy anymore . - Why is that ? - Because I 've lost my family . Excuse me , it 's Claire 's first day of college and I 'm already late , which doesn 't help the situation . It appears Tracy Strauss just paid you a visit . What I can 't figure out is how she survived . I put a bullet in her . She shattered into a thousand pieces of ice . Ice melts . I 'm gonna take a wild guess ... that your being here isn 't a coincidence . I 'm here ... to offer a solution to our mutual problem . You and I kill Tracy Strauss before she kills us . Last time I made a deal with you , you tried to stab me with a syringe . Fair enough . I 'm thinking you 're next on her list . - We 're both wanted men . - So what are you doing here ? You ought to be hiding under a rock somewhere . Just because the government stopped hunting them doesn 't mean I have . I hear you and the Petrellis , you 're back into business to do that . You heard wrong . I 'm not into that anymore . I 'm changing careers . - What did you do , grow a conscience ? - Time to cash out . - Start over . - Guys like us ... We don 't start over . I 'm not like you . She 's coming back for you . You know that , right ? I guess you 're on your own . I guess I am . No , thank you . You made the right call . Cheerleaders are a subversive group . You don 't wanna mix with that crowd . I used to be one of them . - So you know . - I do . Were you ? You weren 't a cheerleader , were you ? I tried out , but I didn 't make the team . They said that my cheers sounded more like taunts . Yeah , that 's not good . I 'm Gretchen Berg . Who are you ? - I 'm Claire Bennet . - Hi , Claire Bennet . So where are you from ? Kind of all over the place . Been in Southern California for a while , but Texas originally , Odessa . Really ? - I 'm from Austin . - Small world . Wait , you 're not that Claire Bennet , are you ? Which Claire Bennet would that be ? Murder-at-Union-Wells-in-Odessa Claire Bennet . You heard about that ? A cheerleader in Texas gets her head sawed off at the homecoming game ? I 've heard about that . You know , I kind of want to keep the whole murder at Union Wells on the D-L . No kidding . If I were you , I would change my name . Like now . They 'd probably let you do it over the phone . No , they won 't . I would know . I changed my name for a while . Why did you change it back ? 'cause I wanted to be Claire Bennet again . I thought people might forget . No , girl . Google 's your enemy . I have to take care of something . - Nice to meet you . - You too . What have you done to me , Mom ? Took me a half hour to get here . I 'm sorry . Where are my manners ? You look lovely as usual . Miss Petrelli , we 're here . Thank you , Alfred . What have you done to me ? Took me a half an hour to get here . I 'm sorry . Where are my manners ? You look lovely . As usual . You okay , Mom ? I 'm just ... I 'm worried about the company , that 's all . I 'm worried that Noah might be wavering . He 's been very distracted lately . I 'll talk to him . Do I like sushi ? You had a craving for yellowtail . I wanted Italian . Interesting . Life . It 's all about new horizons . - It keeps you from getting stale . - Exactly . You know , these last couple of weeks I 've been taking stock of a lot of things . I feel like there 's a lot of ... I don 't know , Mom . Guess there 's a lot of change going on with me . - Really ? - Yeah . - How so ? - I don 't know . When I look back on my life , it seems like it 's not my life I 'm looking back on . Does that make any sense ? Self-reflection . Happens when you hit 40 , along with all sorts of other unpleasant surprises . I 'm being serious , Mom . Look at the person I 've been , the kind of father . The kind of brother . The kind of son to you . You 've been just fine under the circumstances . I have been a jackass . But I 'll change all that . I 'm gonna reconnect with everybody in my life who 's important , and this time , I 'm gonna be a better me . You have a big , important , stressful life . And it 's bound to get confusing . And a man your age starts to feel his own mortality . That 's just it . I don 't feel mortal . I feel invincible . It 's midlife crisis . That 's all this is . Here 's my suggestion . You go out and you get yourself a big expensive sports car and a younger woman with questionable morals . That 's what your father did , and it worked for him . What would I be without you ? I 'm gonna get the phone , okay ? Detective Parkman ? I told you never to call me . We have a problem . - What kind of problem ? - That thing you did six weeks ago . When you and Bennet strong-armed me into playing God ? I think Sylar 's beginning to emerge again . That 's because he is Sylar . No , you made Sylar go away when you turned him into my son . I saw you do it . - Then why are you calling me ? - Because you need to fix it . Patch it up , upgrade it , whatever it is you do . How exactly ? You go back into his mind and erase his memory again . That 's what you do . Not anymore . I stopped . Look , ever since that day , I have felt like something got inside of me and I can 't get it out . I started seeing things and I ... I 've stopped , okay ? I 'm done . I 'm out . There 's no such thing as out , Detective . - Not for people like us . - Yeah , speak for yourself . I 'm telling you , Sylar could emerge at any minute . Are you telling me you are not willing to fix our problem ? This is not our problem . This is your problem . So ... Good luck with it . And honestly , I 'm sure she could be a really above-average student if she applied herself . You made it . Yeah , I 'm sorry I 'm late . I was having a little trouble with my car . And Annie was just ... catching me up . She was ? So I 'll see you at the mixer tonight . I hear they have Guitar Hero 3 set up down there . I sort of excel at Guitar Hero 3 , so consider yourself served . Very nice to meet you , Mr. Bennet . You too . So Annie was catching you up . Maybe you can take that algebra class next semester . But see , Daddy , that is probably the least interesting part of my day . - How so ? - I was recognized as a survivor of the homecoming massacre back in Odessa . Well , my name was . I 'm sorry . Changing your name back to Bennet wasn 't such a great idea after all , but college is for reinventing yourself . I don 't want to pretend to be anyone but me . I just wanna be Claire Bennet , daughter of Noah Bennet . Annie asked me today what my dad did for a living . And I actually told her the truth . Ish . I told her you worked for the government , but still . I like telling the truth . What if ... my way of reinventing myself ... is by telling the truth ? - Ish . - Ish . - Maybe not the whole truth . - The whole truth . Just be careful , sweetheart . All right , Lydia . Show me ... who he is . His name is Danko . Emile Danko . You wanted to see me , Sam . I have a favor to ask of you , Edgar . Can 't you send someone else this time ? I 'd take it as a compliment to your unique skills . What you said this morning about redemption ... I 'm hoping that 's possible . All of this . Yes , well , I left out the part about vengeance . That 's where he comes in . But I 've only killed when I 've absolutely had to . The line 's been crossed . They crossed it , not us . I need you to go to him , get the compass back , and kill the son of a bitch . What Joseph would have wanted . Joseph 's not here anymore . I 'm sorry . I won 't ask you again after this one . I promise . I was thinking I 'd be the one that got away . You 're just number five . You know , five 's my lucky number . Or it used to be . Is it still lucky ? I haven 't decided yet . You broke into a thousand pieces , and yet here you are . That is a neat trick . It wasn 't a trick . I felt myself shatter . Melting ... All those pieces came floating back together with one cohesive thought . Killing all of you . That 's the part that I don 't get . I don 't think you 're really a killer . That 's not who you are . That 's all I am . You took the rest away from me . I can help you get your life back . How ? Danko said that he wouldn 't stop until I was killed . What if I could make it so that Danko wasn 't interested in you anymore ? Why do you want to do this for me ? 20 years of bagging and tagging and I never helped ... a single one of you . Maybe we 're both looking for redemption . What do you say ? Is it a deal ? I bet you wish it was that easy . I got your phone call . Change your mind about Tracy Strauss ? I came here to change yours . Sorry . I 'm gonna kill her . Even if I have to suck her up in a wet vac to do it . She murdered four of my men . She 's a killer . I 'm recommending that you let this thing go . You said guys like us never start over . I 'm offering you a chance to do just that . Consider it a permanent vacation , courtesy of the U.S. government . Not interested . Not acceptable . I want you to forget about Tracy Strauss . We all want things , Bennet . And I 'm gonna get what I want . Hey , this is Peter . Leave a message . Get back to you when I can . Thanks . Look , I 've left you ... I 've left you three messages . You need to call me back . Something 's happening to me and you 're the only person who 's gonna understand what it is . It 's ... Just call me . Please . - Who the hell are you ? - You know exactly who I am . They sent you to get it back . He made you forget . What did you say ? It 's not worth it . - Who are you ? - You took something from us . - Now I 'm gonna get it back . - You 're never gonna find it . I think I will . I 'm sorry if I freaked you out with that whole murder thing . I just ... it was so scandalous and I got excited . Don 't apologize . It was just weird talking about it because I was never allowed to talk about it before . So what , you pretended like it didn 't happen ? I just kept trying to start my life over , taking what I liked about who I was and leaving all the other stuff behind . That is how you play Guitar Hero . Hey , come on , over here ! You and me . You have been served . Come on ! Who is she ? She 's horrible . She 's been hogging the thing all night . - That would be my roommate . - Come on , we 're up . I was gonna play with Gretchen . - Does Gretchen know how to play ? - No , but Gretchen doesn 't care . Your opponent 's supposed to raise your game , not lower it . Since neither one of us know what we 're doing , we 'll be on even playing fields . This is gonna be really bad . I got one . Yellow . I must be getting better every second . Who is he ? His name is Hiro . Hiro Nakamura . - And he was here at the carnival . - When ? How long ago ? 14 years . Thank you , Lydia . That 's all for now . Are we really going to stop moving after all these years ? It 's time . Listen ... I know you 're weak . But I need you to try and do it one more time . For me . I think we found someone who can help us fix the past . That 's good news , Samuel . I need you to send me back . How far ? 14 years . I didn 't see you leave the party . Guess you 're still there . And you left the windows open . Matty , are you hiding again ? Where 's Matty ? Hi , Daddy ! I want my body back . You put him down . Poor Daddy . He looks pretty scared , huh ? Can you say " freaking out " ? I don 't understand . How are you even here ? I 'm part of you , Matt . Whatever you did to me , I held on , and now I 'm inside your head . You 're not real ? Then how could I be holding your little boy ? Put him down . Not until you give me what I want . You did something to me , to my mind . That 's why I 'm here . Tell me what you did . What did you put in my body ? - Put him down and we 'll talk . - Tell me . Here comes Mommy . Catch . Matt , are you okay ? I thought I heard him crying , that 's all . Matt , he 's fast asleep . What 's going on with you ? I 'm just tired , I guess . Come back to bed . I must have dialed the wrong number . Who were you looking for ? Yeah , she 's here . Hang on . No , this is Tracy . I didn 't do it . What have you got to lose , Hiro ? Do I know you ? The name 's Samuel , and I think we 're gonna be great friends . Did your roommate express any suicidal thoughts , feelings of being overwhelmed , low self-esteem ? No , if anything , she had too much self-esteem . She was an overachiever . She loved herself . That 's not the impression she left in her suicide note . - What suicide note ? - This was on her pillow . - No , it wasn 't . - Something you overlooked ? I distinctly remember being impressed with how crisp her pillowcase was and that there wasn 't a suicide note . This wasn 't there . Get them out of here . You said she was an overachiever ? Even an overachiever can 't write a suicide note after she 's dead . She wouldn 't do this . She was just beating the entire floor 's butt at Guitar Hero . This was not a suicide . What , then ? Murder ? Why would someone murder your roommate ? I don 't know . Isn 't that your job ? Yep , it sure is . Thanks for your help , Miss Bennet . So you 're a time traveler ? How did you know that ? I have a gift , Hiro . Just like you . What are you doing here ? I 'm thinking it has something to do with that young man . Is he you ? Yes , but I cannot interfere . - Why not ? - Because this is where it starts , how I become the master of time and space . If I interfere , I will never become a hero . I won 't save the cheerleader , and New York will explode . It 's the Butterfly Effect . That would be bad . But I bet there 's some butterflies that you could change . I mean , why not make this trip worthwhile ? You can never change the past . It 's bad , always . - Everything is connected . - Not everything . Sometimes , if you want to change one thing , that 's all you do . Change one thing . You have a rare gift , Hiro , to right the wrongs of your life . Isn 't there anything else you 'd care to fix ? The slushy incident ! That was all my fault . I bumped into Ando and made him spill his drink all over Kimiko 's favorite dress . That is the reason why she started to hate him . Your chance to make them happy . You have the power . I have a code to never change the ... There are things that are wrong . You can make them right . If you master these skills , you and I will have a bright future together . - You and me ? I don 't understand . - You just need to take a chance . Danko and I , we were just talking in the hall . The next thing I know , he 's dead , and this guy is on me . I got lucky . This whole water thing , it kicked in on instinct . What are you doing here , Tracy ? - I wanted you to leave Danko to me . - I couldn 't just let it go . I didn 't know if I could trust you to deal with him . This is my life . I needed to know . When I got here , I saw that you did what you promised . He didn 't know me . So I figured , just live and let live . - And as I was leaving , this guy ... - The guy with the knives ? He was fast . Scary fast . Definitely one of us . One of me . You have no idea why he 'd want to kill Danko ? I think I heard him say he was looking for something . I don 't know . Maybe it was revenge . - Danko made a lot of enemies . - This wasn 't revenge . Look at the wounds . They were all to the stomach . If it were me , and I was looking for revenge , I 'd go for the jugular or the carotid artery or the heart . I think you heard right . I think the killer was looking for something . - That 's personal . - And I think ... I found it . What is that ? A key . To what ? That 's a good question . Come on , Matty-man , you can do it . Show me you 're a big boy . - Look at you ! - Did you see that ? - All right . - Good job . I got him . I got him . Good job , dude . - He 's usually cold to strangers . - Roy 's not a stranger . He 's been delivering water since Matty was born . I can 't believe it 's been that long . Time flies , huh , Janice ? Yeah , it sure does . The heating unit is busted . I 'll swing by later to fix it . Thanks , Roy . Thanks , Roy . No problem . What ? - That 's my name . - No , your name is Mrs. Parkman . When I delivered water , we were professional . - You never delivered water . - Pizza , water , whatever . The point is ... He was here , I wasn 't , and I 'm just a little pissed . I thought we were past that . We are . I 'm sorry . You 're tired . You haven 't been sleeping properly . - I 've been snoring a lot less . - I 'm worried about you . It 's just work . I got a lead on this huge drug ring , and all I need is the name of the supplier . If you could read a few minds , would it be a lot easier , right ? I 'm not doing that anymore , right ? I kicked that for good . I know , and I 'm proud of you . I 'm just worried that it 's taking a toll . Don 't worry . I got this under control . Can we talk for a minute ? Can I get you something to drink ? Yeah , thanks . - Love what you 've done with the place . - Thank you . So I have water or mustard . Water is good . - So what have you been up to ? - I got my old job back . Paramedic . It must be keeping you busy . Your mother says she hasn 't seen you in weeks . This is amazing . Is this all you ? Are you using powers ? Well , in my line of work , it helps to be ... strong , agile . Incident , 23rd and ... Thank you , Dr. Suresh . It 's a pretty convenient power . Good for you . One of us has got to make up for all we 've done . - Meaning ... - You , me , my family , the Company . We haven 't exactly been model citizens , Noah . It 's a pretty heavy burden for one guy . You said you wanted to talk . Danko 's dead . Killed ... because of this . - A key ? - I did some research . This key opens a safe deposit box in a downtown bank . Now the way I figure it , the killer is probably waiting for whoever shows up with this key . I need a partner on this , somebody I can trust . He could jump me anywhere , and I 'd never know what hit me , 'cause he 's super fast and he has a thing for knives . How fast ? Thanks for letting me stay with you . Of course . I would never leave you here . Not after what happened . Annie 's parents came by last night . I thought they should know about the " supposed-suicide letter . " You didn 't say anything , did you ? No , but I think they have the right to know , don 't you ? If it were me , you would want to know . It 's not your business to tell the parents about the note . Let the police handle it . It 's the truth . - Welcome back . - Hey . Gretchen , this is my mom . A pleasure . Bizarre , huh ? I heard you told the cops that you didn 't see a suicide note . So what do you think , murder or horrific accident ? - Claire may have been mistaken . - May have been ? Did you see one or not ? I didn 't at first , but it was dark . Maybe I missed it . Suicide makes no sense . I mean , the girl had a trajectory . Who maps out their life for 50 years then throws themself out a window ? I should go . You okay ? - Thanks for everything . - You 're welcome . Remember , new life , new beginning . - Bye . Nice to meet you . - Likewise . So , it 's murder , right ? How do we prove it ? - Your knife guy 's gonna show ? - I don 't know , but it sure makes me feel better having you around . I 'll bet . Do you mind if I make an observation ? I think you should seriously consider how you 're living your life . Where did that come from ? I saw your apartment , the police scanner , all those newspaper articles . You 're saving lives keeping track . I 'll bet you know all their names . - And ? - Do any of them know yours ? It 's not healthy to live alone . No connections to anybody . It 's a dead end . Trust me . I 'm Exhibit " A. " For years , I put my job ahead of my family , and now my kids are off at school and I 'm eating cereal for dinner and a strange man is answering my wife 's phone . My point is I 'm alone . That 's no way to live . Here you are , Mr. Danko . And I 'll be right outside when you 're finished . So what 'd we win ? A compass . Danko got killed for a compass ? A broken compass . We need just another minute . That doesn 't belong to you . - He has power . - I got it . - I got it . - Bloody hell . - What happened ? - I don 't know . He took off . He 's still breathing . - Thanks a lot , Doc . - Okay . - How is he ? - Recovering . - I hope it was worth it . - No , not really . I can 't figure out why Danko thought this was worth dying for . Could I see it ? - What 'd you do ? - I didn 't do anything . Apparently , it only works for you . Here . Peter , this is a lead . You saw that guy . There could be others like him . My life finally makes sense to me . In the last six weeks , I have saved 53 people . I 'm with you foran hour , and some innocent almost gets killed ? The further I stay away from you and whatever it is that you 're doing , the happier I 'm gonna be . He murdered Danko . He almost killed you and me for this . So why don 't you just let him have it ? My life is simple . I understand it . I don 't need for things to get complicated . - So why 'd you come with me ? - The ability . It 'll help me do my job better . The one where I actually save people . I guess this is good-bye . I wish you all the luck in the world . Thank you , Noah . Call your mother . Forensic Pathology Principles and Practice , Spitz and Fisher 's Medicolegal Investigations of Death , Knight 's Forensic Pathology with All Relevant Addendum . Where did you get those , the homicide bookstore ? Is there such a place ? Don 't you think you 're going a little overboard ? Don 't you want to prove your roommate was defenestrated ? Of course . And yes , I know what " defenestrated " means . Don 't get mad at me for using it in a sentence . Have you ever heard of the " jump , push , fall " test ? The what ? It 's when cops get a dummy the size and weight of the victim , and they throw it out the window to see how it lands . What page is that on ? It 's not in there . I saw it on an episode of Crossing Jordan . If you fall , you go straight down . If you jump , you go a little further . But if you 're pushed ... Sorry . All we need is a dummy of the size and weight of Annie . You 're not serious . Maybe we could swipe a cadaver from the medical school . What ? It 's a victimless crime . Let 's not get carried away . Why not ? This is murder ! Maybe , but I 'm not trying to be a social pariah before midterms . The ship 's already sailed . So where do we get our hands on a dead body ? My name 's Matt . It 's been six weeks since I last used , and ... I 'm feeling confused . When I used , I was totally selfish . I didn 't think about what I did to others , and how I may have hurt them . Sorry . You mean like what you did to me ? My name is Sylar . It 's been about six weeks or so since I 've seen my body , and I want it back . Recently , there have been these ... ghosts . These things have been popping up from my old life and haunting me . You 're gonna stop using your powers ? Are you crazy ? I bet you couldn 't even make it through a day . I can 't get it out of my head . You 're weak ! You 're simpleminded ! - I could make you use your powers ! - Go away ! I could make you ... use your powers ! I 'm sorry . Hey , buddy , are you okay ? Does this guy look okay , seriously ? I mean , look . 20 pounds overweight , high blood pressure , a heart attack waiting to happen ! Stop it ! Let 's get things moving along a bit ... Who 's next ? Let me take a crack at this guy , see if I can get him to talk . Now you seemed a little off today at the meeting . No . I 'm good . - You sure ? - I 'm good . I 'm under control . Double shot mocha . You could use a little pick-me-up . It 's okay . No strings attached . Not interested . Come on , let 's do this easy , all right ? Just two guys talking . Come on . I get it . You are the good cop . How ironic . So we need a name . Your supplier , all right ? You give us that name , you keep a clean record . He 's a liar , totally lying . Why are you looking at my forehead ? - Does it say " schmuck " ? - I wasn 't staring at your forehead . You 're not getting a name , coffee boy . Is that all you need ? What are you waiting for ? It 's got to be floating around in his comical little brain . I don 't do that anymore . - Do what ? - Because you 're addicted ? - Leave me . - Who are you talking to ? Just read his mind , Matt . You know you want to ! I could help you . I could take a chunk out of his skull in the process . - Stop it ! - What 's the matter with you ? - Just give me a name , okay ? - Take it from him ! - Why not ? - Leave me alone . You are a loser . No wonder your wife is having sex with the water guy . - Shut up . - I didn 't say anything . - I 'm not talking to you . - She 's cheated on you once already , and we both know what Janice needs is a real man . Someone who 's not afraid of power . Someone who knows what to do with it . I 'm in control here , not the power . And not you , you son of a bitch ! Keppler . The guy 's name is Keppler . Lives in Long Beach , okay ? Just leave me alone . - Have a nice day off ? - Very productive . I got a lot done . You okay ? Yeah . That 's ... I 'm fine . - Is that clam chowder ? - It is . Where 'd you get it ? This place called Legal Sea Foods . I got one for you . - Never heard of it . - It 's up in Boston . - How 'd you get it down here ? - I know a guy . That 's the partner I know and love . All available units , Code Three , Fifth and Lexington . Never mind that . We 've still got five minutes till we 're on duty . Just hang on , okay ? He took the compass . How are you ? You know , it looks worse than it feels . When you called , I figured I owed it to you . You know that key inside of Danko ? It turns out it led me to a ... broken , old compass . Your friend with the knives just came and took it back anyway . - You gonna go after him ? - I don 't know . I prefer the old way of doing business . One of me , one of you . This new way just feels too ... dangerous to try to stop them alone . Maybe this guy with the knives is like me , just trying to get their life back ... Keeping what 's his . Maybe the idea isn 't to stop them but to figure out a way to help them . Yeah , maybe . So be honest . Why did you call ? I can 't call my wife . My ... ex-wife . And I didn 't want to worry Claire , so I just ... I get it . You don 't want to be alone . Yeah , I guess not . So what 's in the bag ? I have no idea . What is it ? Clam chowder ? It 's still warm . You have someone looking out for you . You want some ? There 's plenty . You got an extra spoon ? You don 't need to jam it , or else you 'll just bust the coil again . Guess you don 't know your own strength . Hi , honey . - Roy fixed the hot water . - Awesome , Roy . Everything okay at work ? Yeah . It was another banner day . - Let me walk you out , buddy . - Sure thing . See you Tuesday . - Thanks , Roy . - Bye , Matty-man . You be a good boy . You got a family of your own , Roy ? Maybe someday . Thanks for fixing the hot water and all , but ... My pleasure . It must be tough out there for a single mom . Look , she 's not single anymore . Tomorrow , you 're gonna ask for a new route and you 're never gonna stop by this house again . So I 'm starting a new route . Guess this is good-bye . Yeah , it is . Gotcha . Jump , push , fall . I guess she did kill herself . You had me worried . Sorry , getting the compass back was a lot harder than I thought . I met an empath . Did you talk to him ? Didn 't really get a chance . Lydia says you found another time traveler . Someone to replace Arnold . I don 't like that word . You can 't replace family . But the Chinese guy ? Japanese . They put him on a righteous path , but he 'll come back to us . So what 's next ? We gather the rest .

 Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race . The 21st century is when everything changes and Torchwood is ready . Gwen , we 've texted you the location , we 're querying four or five signs of life , definitely non-human . Get here as soon as you can . So , sure they 're not Weevils ? Don 't think so , different energy patterns , can 't make sense of it . Not a species we 've encountered before . Let 's hope they 're friendly . Owen , Ianto , take the other side of the building , check the upper floors . Toshiko with me . OK ? Go ! I 'm getting mirror readings on both floors . One creature at either end of the building . Toshiko , split up . Y 'know , these creatures are very quiet . Maybe they 're sleeping . Or hatching . Or maybe they aren 't creatures at all . Just explosive devices . Snap . Shit . 'You have one message . ' 'Gwen , we 've texted you the location , we 're querying four or five signs of life . ' Shit . Oh , not again . Ladies . Torso of steel , shilling a feel . Any takers ? Bar fight , got a little out of control . Flesh wound . Whoa ! Whoa ! Still not used to ... .. these hangovers . Captain Jack Harkness . How long have you been there ? Silent types . That 's OK . I used to date a guy with no mouth . Surprisingly creative . Listen , you only had to ask . Can we get a room though ? When I said about getting a room , I meant somewhere with linen . Time was , electrodes to the nipples meant the start of a good night . Full power charge and still breathing . Pretty advanced piece of equipment you got there . You ladies are ahead of yourselves . Now where the hell am I ? Put that down before somebody gets ... Why aren 't you dead yet ? Been trying to figure that out myself . We 've been monitoring you . You 've been killed 14 times in the last six months . Feels like more than that . Who 's the Doctor ? No idea . " The Doctor , he 'll be able to fix me " " When the Doctor turns up , it 'll all be put right " " You wait till I see the Doctor . " First I 'm going to kiss him , then I 'm going to kill him . " Transcripts of your conversations with strangers , in various drinking dens , since you first came to our attention . Y 'know , no-one likes a smart-ass . Tell us where he is and we 'll release you . Why do you wanna know ? You 're in Torchwood , Cardiff . The Torchwood Institute was created to combat the threat posed by the Doctor and other phantasmagoria . He 's not a threat . The Doctor 's the one who 'll save you from your phantasmahoojits . Just tell us his location . I don 't know ! He left me behind . I came here to find him . He refuels from that rift you have . Hoping if I stayed here long enough , we 'd find each other . Now , can I go ? No . You can 't keep me here ! Oh , we can . Unless ... Yes . Unless . Unless what ? There are opportunities here . With the Institute . I 'm not for hire . You 're going to need currency . What 's the assignment ? Missing person . Well , when we say person ... I haven 't done anything ! Burglaries , joyriding a horse and carriage , pick-pocketing , 24 instances of consuming food without paying for it . I 'll make it up , I promise ! Ah , too late . It 's just a bit of fun . This planet 's a century away from official first contact with alien life . You 're upsetting the schedule . Who are you ? I 'm Torchwood . I said sorry ! You can 't lock me up ! He 's just a kid . Send him back to where he came from . If only we could . The rift only goes one way . What do you do ? Observe and profile the species and then transfer them to long term storage ? Why ? It was a threat to the Empire . Like me ? You 're our ally now . If you don 't want it ... Your next assignment . No . I 'm through with you people . Your liberty is at our discretion . Work for us , you assist the Empire . Sever that tie , you become a threat . And you 've seen how we deal with threats . It 's good money , Captain . How else are you going to earn ? See what you think in the morning . He 's pretty . But you 're prettier . Can I read your cards ? No , thank you . No , really . He 's coming . The one you 're looking for . But the century will turn twice before you find each other again . Oooh ! Are you for real ? You mean I have to wait 100 years to find him ? What 'll I do in the meantime ? 'Some parts of the world have already welcomed in the New Year . 'Our cameras , of course , have been out in force across the UK tonight . 'Let 's take you first to Cardiff . ' Hey , when you joked about the Millennium Bug , I didn 't realise it was gonna have 18 legs stacked with poison . Anyone home ? You know you 're supposed to party like it 's ... Alex ? Jack ! Just in time . Alex what happened ? Who did this ? Me . What ? Why ? We got it wrong , Jack . We thought we could control the stuff we found . And what 's it brought us ? So much death . What happened to them ? It 's good you 're here . Always did have great timing . This place , it 's yours . Torchwood Three , my gift to you , Jack , for a century of service as field operative . Give this place a purpose . Before it 's too late . Please . Alex , listen , it 's gonna be OK . No . It 's not . It 's really not . I looked inside . It showed me what 's coming . They were mercy killings . It was the kindest thing I could do . So none of us see the storm . I 'm sorry I can 't do the same for you . 21st century , Jack . Everything 's gonna change . And we 're not ready . Alex ! He was dead . I checked his pulse ! He was dead ! All right ! Sh ! Jack , what has happened ? Where are the others ? What is he doing here ? Look , I was late , OK . He gave me a lift . You OK ? Toshiko . She went the other way . VOICES SHOUT Toshiko ! Toshiko ! SHE SCREAMS Never thought I 'd say this to anyone here , but you work too hard . Another hour and I 'm done . Wish the rest of them thought like you . Half past five , they 're out of here like a pack of dogs . You have a good evening , sir . I doubt it . Another late one , Miss Sato . You know me , George . Married to the job . When you gonna let me whisk you away from all this ? As soon as you clear it with your wife and grandchildren . Always an excuse . Take care . Goodnight , George . I 've got it . Get in . I want to see my mother . I want to know she 's safe . Now . Show me the piece . Oh , it 's beautiful . Perfect sonic modulator . Toshiko , you 've done so well . Toshiko ! You 've got what you want . Now let her go . Except now you 're the victim of your own success . Perfectly situated , proven ability . You can give us so much more . SHE SPEAKS IN JAPANESE And what if I refuse ? Then your mother stays with us . And your brilliance is used against her . Like this . No , don 't ! Turn it off ! Turn it off ! My mother ! Is she all right ? Is she all right ? 'This is a UNIT facility . Your rights as a citizen have been withdrawn . 'You will be held here indefinitely . 'We are not required to provide you with legal representation . 'Anything you say will be recorded . 'You will be allowed no communication with any person or organisation outside this facility . 'There is no right of appeal . 'If you fail to comply with the rules , we are authorised to discipline you . ' Is my mother safe ? ' We cannot supply you with that information . ' 'Prisoner Sato . Inspection . ' What for ? 'Prepare for inspection . ' Catering 's as lousy as they say , huh ? Where 's my mother ? She 's safe . She won 't remember being kidnapped . I wiped it from her memory . I hope you don 't mind . You did what ? ! Really , just a little pill . She 'll never have known . Who are you ? Nobody . I don 't exist . And for a man with my charisma , that is quite an achievement . Are you a lawyer ? Do I look like a lawyer ? They 're gonna make an example of you . Stealing official secrets , in today 's climate ... They 're going to keep you here without charge . Forever . They can 't do that . They 're never going to release you . I 'm sorry . You made this , right ? I just followed the plans . Yeah , kinda . But first you had to grasp the concept of what a sonic modulator does . Most people would struggle with that . And another thing ... the plans don 't work . What ? The technical plans you followed , they were wrong . They had mistakes in them . That 's why the plans were shelved . But you , Toshiko Sato , you automatically fixed things as you went . .. What I 'm trying to say is ... .. oh baby , you 're good . I mean , you 're good now . Imagine what you 'd be like with a little training . Oh ! Shame you 're gonna be locked up for so long . You 've got to get me out of here . If ... you come work for me . Really ? Give me five years , I 'll get them to wipe your record clean . They owe me a few favours . What do you do ? Protect people . Least , that 's what I 'm aiming for . It 's kind of a work in progress . What about my mother ? Limited contact only . You can send her postcards . So what d 'you say ? Why would you trust me ? Instinct . It 's going to be dangerous . Think you can bear a little danger ? SCREAMING Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Tosh , are you OK ? You 're making it worse . It 's pushing down even more now . I think I 've broken my arm . Gwen . Yeah ? If this pillar shifts down even more , it 'll crush me . We 're gonna need more strength . Look , Jack has gone to find Owen and Ianto . You 're gonna be fine , all right . You 've gotta hurry , please . Go help Jack . I 'll stay here . Are you sure ? Yep . I 'm going to come back for you darling , all right ? You 're going to be OK . Gwen , this could 've been you , couldn 't it ? If you hadn 't been late . I haven 't got time for this now . I 've got to find the others . Ianto ! Ianto ! Thanks . No , thank you . And you are ? Jones , Ianto Jones . Nice to meet you , Jones , Ianto Jones . Cap 'n Jack Harkness . Lucky escape . I had it under control . You think so ? It looked pretty vicious . You 're , um ... You were bleeding . Had worse from shaving . Looked like a Weevil to me . I 've no idea what you 're talking about . I 'll take him from here . Thanks for the assistance . Anytime . By the way , love the coat . Morning . Coffee ? Wow ! I want to work for you . Sorry . No vacancies . Look , let me tell you about myself . Ianto Jones , born August 19th 1983 . Able student but not exceptional , one minor conviction for shoplifting in your teens . Number of temporary jobs , mainly a drifter , until two years ago you join the Torchwood Institute in London . Junior researcher . Girlfriend , Lisa Hallett . Deceased . I 'm sorry . Look , you checked me out . You knew what a Weevil was . Thought I was gonna have to come deal with you . I have the right qualifications for the job . There is no job . We 're nothing to do with Torchwood London . I severed all links . Yet when it burned , two members of your team scavenged the ruins . Don 't want the equipment getting into the wrong hands . And you 're the right hands , are you ? Trial period , three months . No . Three weeks . Three days . Let me prove myself to you . I 'll work for nothing . No . I saw what they did at Canary Wharf . What am I supposed to do with those memories ? You are not my responsibility . And we 're not hiring . Same time tomorrow then . There is no job for you here and there never will be . I really like that coat . Toshiko , see if you can decode those hieroglyphics . Already on it . Owen , take a cross section of the paramedic 's brain , check it against the list of chemical agents . Will do . Susie , we 're going to need to dredge the reservoir . See if you can find the other half . OK , this has to stop . No , listen to me . I don 't have time for this . I don 't care what your problem is , I want you out of this city by sunrise . There is no place for you here . Go back to London , find yourself another life . Keep stalking me , I 'll wipe your memory . No , but the thing is ... Any conversation between us , no matter what the subject , is over ! I 'm getting back behind the wheel of that car and if you 're still in the road , I 'm going to drive through you . You 're not gonna help me catch this pterodactyl then ? OK , that is the only special equipment you 've got ? Yeah , cos I keep dinosaur nets in the back of the SUV . Torchwood London would 've . SCREECHING How did you find it ? Rift activity locator . Torchwood London . See , quality kit . Yeah , it 's quite excitable . Must be your aftershave . Never wear any . You smell like that naturally ? 51st century pheromones . You people have no idea . Ready for another go ? I 'm game if you are . Three , two , one ... Split up ! We 're not gonna harm you . You can 't stay here . Come back with me . I 've got somewhere nice and big where you can fly around . OK , so you 'll let the pterodactyl in and not me . We need a guard dog . I can be that . Like a receptionist . Building maintenance , food and drink , dry cleaning even . That coat of yours must take a battering . Like a butler , I could be a butler . We don 't need a butler . Excuse me , dried egg on your collar . It was a busy week . What exactly is your plan ? I 'm going to be the decoy . And it will rip you to shreds . Dinosaurs ? Had ' em for breakfast . Had to , only source of pre-killed food protein after the asteroid crashed . Long story . Here you go . One injection to the central nervous cortex . I 'll keep it occupied . Move . No . What ? It knows me . I 'll be a better decoy . No , way too dangerous . No , I 've got a secret weapon . Chocolate . Preferably dark . IANTO WHISTLES I got your favourite , yeah . It 's good for your serotonin levels . If you 've got serotonin levels . Whoa ! Aagh ! Whoah ! Ianto ! Sorry ! I should go . Hey ! Report for work ... first thing tomorrow . Like the suit , by the way . Ready ? One , two three ... Come on . You OK ? My shoulder . I think it 's dislocated . Can you take this ? Yeah . Take a deep breath . CRUNCHING Where are the others ? We need your help to get Toshiko out . Owen ? No sign yet . If anything happens he can 't repair himself . Of course , he can 't heal , can he ? OK , we 'll help Rhys with Toshiko . Let us know when you find Owen . And be careful . OK . OK ? All right ? CREAKING FROM OVERHEAD Oh , go on , please , please , please , please , please ! No , you don 't even like her , ever since she didn 't pay for her share of the Chinese in Leicester . Yeah , but we want Julia to come and it 'll look odd if we invite one without the other . Oh , please , help me God ! Three tables done . Nine more to go . You wanna back out ? It 's still not too late . Listen , I 'm marrying you even if it kills me . OK ? Good . Do you want a cup of tea ? Yeah , I 'll make one . I think I can manage . Katie . Yeah ? Um , water . Yeah . From the kettle . Milk . Stop nagging me ! I don 't want to have milk . I 've never liked milk . I want to have ... Tea . I wanna have tea without ... Milk . Tea without milk . Darling , it 's all right . It 's all right . I got your invitation . Still going ahead ? I promised her a summer wedding . Before all this . This changes nothing . Owen , it will change everything . You don 't know for certain . We 've been through Kate 's test results more times than any patient in my whole career . All the evidence suggests she has early onset Alzheimer 's . The youngest case in medical history . It doesn 't mean we 're wrong . Please ... run more tests . Let 's just try one more MRI scan . An MRI isn 't going to make any difference . You don 't know that . You have said yourself that this is unlike any case that you 've seen , and maybe you 've missed something . Owen ... You don 't understand , Jim , OK . One day she 's fine , she 's perfect memory , the old Katie , and the next there 's nothing , she 's blank . Now , I am losing her and I don 't know what to do about that , OK ? So please . What 's the point of me doing this job if I can 't help my own fiancee ? I 'll see what I can do . Thank you , Jim . It 's like being lost , in a place you know really well , but you can 't get your bearings . Sometimes it comes back to you . And sometimes ... I 'm sorry , Owen . What 've you got to be sorry for ? I don 't want to put you through this . Last night , I dreamt that you left me . Oh , come on . Nobody 's leaving anyone . How is that possible ? We don 't know . I 've never seen anything like it . It 's not the brain deteriorating . It 's a clear physical tumour . That wasn 't there last week ? Not that we saw . You were right to ask for another scan . So what do we do now ? We have to view this as good news . Katie , we need to take you into surgery , soon as possible , and remove the tumour . D 'you understand ? Katie . I can 't remember your name . Are you sure she 's up to this ? We 're going to do everything we can for her . I 'm sorry . Who the hell are you ? You should prepare for the worst . No , you can 't go in there . Oh , my God ! Katie . What is it ? I 'm sorry . I tried to stop them . She 's dead . That thing in her head is an alien life form . It incubates in the brain , disrupting the shape and functions . When it 's attacked or threatened , it emits a toxic gas that 's fatal to humans . It clears pretty quickly . She can 't be dead . She can 't be dead . I 'm calling , calling the police . Tell them that Torchwood is already here and dealing with it . That 'll save them a call-out . I need to take her brain back with me . Don 't touch her ! How are you feeling ? Where is she ? Where 's who ? Katie . Katie Russell , she 's a junior doctor , she works here , we 're about to get married . Let 's get you back into bed . Get off me . Where is she ? Where is she ? Where is she ? ! Where is she ? ! He was wearing a military uniform . He had an American accent . We have checked all the security footage . There was no such man . Jim Garrett was poisoned by some alien toxin , by some ... Jim Garrett was in a car accident . The American said that he wanted her brain , that there was ... alien creature , or ... This happened , OK ? This is not some trauma or delayed grief or whatever you 're scribbling down . Katie 's tumour was inoperable . There was nothing anyone could have done . This is just wrong . I 'm giving you three months prescribed rest . Don 't come into work . Yeah ! This isn 't right . He was there . It wasn 't just me . He was there too . That is not what happened ! That is ... not what happened . You ! You could 've saved her ! You could 've saved her ! You could 've ... saved her ! I couldn 't . I really couldn 't . If you 're not a figment of my imagination , then I don 't know what 's happening any more . Maybe this is ... what a mental breakdown feels like . You 're fine . It 's the rest of the world that 's delusional . Why her ? There 's no reason . Your life doesn 't end with her . What are you gonna do now ? Go back to work ? See echoes of her in every corridor ? You need a purpose . I 'm building something . I need a medic . And you want me ? You made them take more scans . You kept trying to track me down . You don 't give up easily . I need someone like that to work with me in Cardiff . To fight aliens . Exactly . Look ... I dunno what happened to Katie and I dunno who you really are , but there is no such thing as aliens . You think ? I 'm having a breakdown . Mental collapse . Owen , why did you become a doctor ? I thought if I could save one life , mine would be worthwhile . But you save one ... and there 's another . And another . All clawing at you , demanding to be saved . And even if you do succeed , you can never save enough . Maybe here you can . How are the others ? All right . Careful ! If that falls ... OK , it 's not going to fall ... OK . Just be very careful . OK , all right , all right . We 're gonna get you out . OK , this one ? Look , if you do it very , very gently ... OK . It isn 't going to drop on you . Whoah ! Quiet . OK , sorry . I 'm going to do this as quickly as possible . Listen to me . I 'm going to get you out of this . Look at me , trust me . OK , hold my hands . Sorry . Hold my hands ! You OK ? You all right ? Tosh , what happened ? Broken arm , bruised ribs , about an inch away from being crushed by a girder . You were lucky . We all were . Jack , who 's done this ? And where 's the SUV ? Oh , no . Jack , what does he want ? Oh , deja vu ! Or did I say that already ? Hey , team . Course , there might be a few less of you by now . Don 't know if you liked my little gift . Course , you can 't die . And with all that life , all that time , you can 't spare any for me . Oh ! Say hi to the family . No ... it can 't be . Been a while since you 've seen your brother , eh , Jack . Gray ? OK , here 's what 's going to happen . Everything you love , everything you treasure will die . I 'm going to tear your world apart , Captain Jack Harkness , piece by piece . Starting now . Maybe now you 'll wanna spend some time with me . This was a targeted attack . The beast killed the four most senior officers . If it gets out what happened there 'll be city-wide panic . Let 's get ourselves a good view . What have you done ? We 're going to put the city back together , find Jack ... and punish John . It 's completely crippled us . You 're no fun . Owen , get out of there . What have you done with my brother ? This is going to get nasty . What if this is how it ends ?

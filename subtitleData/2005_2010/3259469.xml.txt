 You will not grow old . You will not die . My name is John , and I 'm an alcoholic . Until you find the one ... I 'm detective Eva Marquez . And your souls are wed ... We 're going to be working together . Are we ? I almost died . Hey , let the good times roll . My heart exploded chasing some guy in the subway . You have a good energy about you , Eva . I think she was there . Who ? The one . The one who 'll make me old like you . So you don 't even know who she is . I know she was there . I 've been waiting centuries for this . If I can find her , it 'll all have value . I shook from a dream . It wasn 't you to shake shake from my own side shake , shake from the light of everything shake , shake from that which sings that come drown your face , your face it will not be back again oh , fate , your face . There 's something in the way what do you think , 36 ? She 's out there somewhere . Cop dropped this off . Snow white and the 7 dwarves ? The real story ? Close .

Are most fat people you know happy ? There it is . " F.D.N.Y.7-3 ... 9 ? " That 's gotta be a 9 . You coming tomorrow ? John . Tomorrow at 10 : 00 . Remember ? She knows what she 's doing . Nurse maybe ? Or a doctor . Lots of people know C.P.R. They wouldn 't be allowed in the back of the ambulance . What about tomorrow ? Omar ? Oh , it all means it 's coming up and back again wolves will howl , birds are singing now 's the time ... wolves will howl , birds are singing now 's the time . Got a minute ? We do . Not sure about the pregnant lady in the back . How dilated ? 6 You 've got time . Ever seen me before ? No offense . Cops all look alike . You run on a heart attack in the subway station at 1-3-7 and b-way last wednesday ? 5 days ago ? This job , that 's a lifetime . Tell me about it . Morning , around 9 : 00 ? Sorry , dude . Doesn 't ring a bell . I 'm having a damn baby ! Can we play jeopardy later ? Women . Gotta jet . Thanks . You really think I wouldn 't remember ? I don 't know anymore . Yeah , I may have a few talents , but forgetting isn 't one of them . Fine . You know what she meant to me . It 's gotten a little hazy . Maybe to you , it has . Not to me . Just seems like the only thing you care about these days is finding this girl . I 've been looking for her for almost 400- - 400 years , I know . The woman who 'll turn your hair gray . The one . So what does that make my mother ? The fifth , the 25th ? Does she get a number like your dogs ? Watch your step , Omar . Or what ? You 're gonna ground me ? Take me to the woodshed ?

New Amsterdam 1x02 edited by rogard New Amsterdam Season 01 Episode 02 Thanks . Autoerotic asphyxiation . Whatever happened to doing it the old fashioned way ? Well , this is old fashioned . In the 1600s , people used it as a cure for erectile dysfunction . I want a new partner . Public hanging was a local spectator sport . Now this guy , a doctor , he noticed that the condemned tended to die happy . I get the picture . Who found him ? Mother 's sister . Parents are on vacation . Unreachable . Nail knot . Nautical . Impossible to tie with one hand . So he had help . A sex partner . Someone who bengs to this maybe . A diamond stud . Maybe . I 'm sorry , sir . It 's a crime scene . It 's all right . We live here .

I told her you were busy , but she won 't leave . Show her in . Miss Brown ? Close the door , Maggie . I 'm a busy man , miss Brown . I have a heavy case load . I had to see you . Really ? Really . There 's been a terrible miscarriage of justice . Don 't tell me . You 're innocent . Very , very guilty . How much time do you have ? All the time in the world . Yeah ? What about school ? Someone 's covering for me . Your students will miss you . Yes . I stay informed of your new love . Kids live a secret life . Not just kids . I suppose your parents knew everything about you . I really can 't remember . This sounds so out of character . As headmaster , I meet a lot of kids , but Matt was unique . He was here on a scholarship . 38 G.P.A. Track star . 18,000 students apply to Brown . You know how many get in ? 1,500 . It used to be fewer . Went there for a while . Yeah , well , Matt would have been one of them . He was the best of the best . Please . Thank you . Mr. Huygens , his parents gave us some names of some of his friends . We 'd like to speak with them . Unfortunately , I can 't allow that . You understand . In loco parentis . Which is latin for you calling your lawyer . We have to protect our kids . Perhaps you could come back later ? Look , we 're here , they 're here . It would just be easier , if you- - no problem . We get paid by the hour . Thanks for your trouble . Don 't ever do that again . You have to know when to let it go . Look , if I wanted a teacher , I 'd go back to SUNY Binghamton- - which is a great school , by the way . Eva ... and just because you went to some fancy pants ivy league school does not make you any smarter or any better- - I know . The unabomber went to Harvard . Disregard . False alarm . You know kids . That 's a class " e " felony . Well , desperate times call for desperate measures . Who 'd you find ? Marika Soloway . Matt 's ex-girlfriend . I knew something bad was going to happen . I knew it . Why ? Just a feeling . I had this really scary dream a couple nights ago . He was--I don 't know- - going away on a ship . The Queen Mary and he only had a one-way ticket . My mom 's a shrink . We heard you two broke up . About a month ago . He got weird . He also quit the track team . Drugs ? That 's original . Everybody does drugs . When was the last time you saw him ? I thought this was an accident . Well , that 's what we 're trying to find out . It must have been at school . Pretty . Vintage ? My grandmother 's . I like simple diamond studs myself . You ever wear ' em ? Marika , can you get back to class please ? We 're just finishing up , you know better than to interview students without parental consent . Did you know Matt Shaw ? Yes . I was his advisor . Hannah Cleary . Look , I 'm sorry . We 're all very upset . It 's a small school . Everyone knows everyone . It 's a tragedy for us all . Marika . 5 minutes , Maggie . Miss Brown is just leaving . How do I look ? Like a dark angel . I mean , can you tell ? We destroyed the evidence . No one can know , John . Your father ? I don 't want to hurt him . I 'm good with secrets . We 'll be in touch , miss Brown . These are your calls . You 've got the Martin arraignment tomorrow at 9 : 00 and lunch with judge farrow . So . Is she the one ? I don 't know . Do I look any older ? You probably look the way you did when my mother married you 50 years ago . I miss your mother , em . I feel older . Well , no wonder . You 're about to celebrate the 300th anniversary of your death . Are you having a party ? Small guest list . Just you and me . She could be it . Time will tell . Just humor me . Al Sharpton and Billy Graham decide they 've got to see the Pope . They take the space shuttle- - just looks like a parachute . Ok . A doctor , a lawyer , and a veterinarian- - sue the duck . Hank Aaron dies- - that 's god . He just thinks he 's Barry Bonds . I hate you . What about the boy ? He died of cerebral anoxia . We found traces of semen on his leg . Let 's hope it was his , but we 'll run a DNA profile anyway . The cool thing is this- - a preliminary tox screen showed the kid had a busload of flunitrazepam in his system . Rohypnol . A.K.A ... Roofies or run-trip-and-fall . The date rape drug . What about these ? Pressure marks ? Yep . This kid may have been gettin ' busy , but he got more than he deserved . So if Matt was such a golden boy , why would someone want to kill him ? So where are we ? The kid was drugged , then strangled . Scene was staged to look like auto-erotic asphyxiation . Suspects ? It 's been 24 hours . There 's already a lot of pressure from upstairs . You need help , ask for it . We just started , lieutenant . All we need is time . Handle this with care . The mayor 's son goes to dray . Everything rolls downhill . Make sure you 're not in the way . You got it . Mr. Shaw . Jack . I 'm sorry I took a swing at you . You 're not the first . Please sit down , Jack . We really want to know what 's going on . I 've worked in a hotel for 20 years . I know how it goes . The rich skate . I 've helped ' em do it . Not on this case . You have our word . Found this in Matt 's knapsack . Looks like gibberish , but ... this--this isn 't random . It 's a code . A substitution cipher . It would help if there was a lookup table or a codebook . These look like transactions . Could Matt have been dealing ? 2 days ago , I would have said no way , but now- - We need access to your place . We have to find that codebook . Yeah , I 'll get you a key . We 're staying at my sister-in-law 's . Irene just can 't stay at home . It uses " h " more than any other letter . Probably a substitute for " e " , the most common letter in the alphabet . So if the substitution was 3 letters down , then these 2 letters ... would " TL " ring any bells ? Yeah . His friend . Tommy Langer . Lucky guess . Matt was special . Once in a blue moon , you get a student like that . When was the last time you spoke to him ? Um , last week , in my life drawing class . He was worried about college . His phone records show that he called your house the day he died . Probably to speak to my husband . He 's the track coach here . We heard Matt quit the team . Any idea why ? Paul and I try to leave work at work . Do you know anyone here who might want to hurt Matt ? Are you sure it wasn 't an accident ? Kids do experiment . That would make it simpler for the school , wouldn 't it ? What do you know about Tommy Langer ? Tommy 's trouble . I don 't know why Matt hung out with him . Omar ? I need to talk to you . Me first . Say hello to my grandson Corey . What are you doing ? I 'm going out . A romantic emergency . And you 're babysitting . What ? I 'm working a case . This is your great-grandson . Your blood . You should get to know each other . We agreed not to do this . We agreed it was better for everyone ... I changed my mind . You find this girl you 're looking for , you 're going to die anyway . What are you worried about ? If you want to put the child asleep , read him one of your books . " If in the spring , she whom I love so well " meet me by some green bank- - " the truth I tell- - " bringing my thirsty soul a cup of wine , I want no better heaven , nor fear a hell . " You 're in trouble . More champagne . I 'll get it . Mr. Brown . What are you doing here ? Don 't say a word . You were my lawyer , John . I trusted you . I won 't make that mistake again . Put your clothes on . - Daddy , it 's not- - - Now . Don 't move , Lily . I am her father . She will do what I say . I 'm not a child . Then stop behaving like one- - This isn 't your business , Mr. Brown . This is between Lily and me . Yeah , and that world out there . That white , white world , that unforgiving world . There is no place for her there . Then we 'll go somewhere else . Did she tell you that she got fired from her teaching job because someone saw the two of you together ? Tell him . The principal don 't like mixing . Tell him . Lily . And today , I followed her here . She had to come up on the service elevator . They thought she was a maid . Tell him . Is that all that you want for yourself , Lily ? Where are we going ? It 's an adventure , Corey . We 're looking for a codebook . It 's a clue in a crime . And tonight , you get to be a crime fighter . Like Superman ? Exactly . Like Superman ? Yeah . Think Superman 's happy ? Why ? 'Cause nothing can kill him . What about kryptonite ? Kryptonite 's not real . Wait here . I 'll tell you a secret . Nothing can kill me either . What , you don 't believe me ? Uh-uh . I 've been shot , stabbed , strangled , poisoned , beaten ... What if your head was cut off ? That hasn 't happened yet . You 'll die . I hope not . You know why I think Superman 's happy ? Lois Lane . Corey , you like games ? Ok , we 're going to play one . You have to be really quiet , ok ? Just sit there . Hello , Tommy . NYPD . Remember , corey . It 's our secret . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? So he could chase some booty . The guy could be a predator , for all you know . You 're watching too much tv . He 's like family . I 'm calling the cops . Sweetheart , he is a cop . My fault . We went to Enoteco for gelato . The line was endless . How you doing ? You must be Halle . I 'm John Amsterdam . Omar 's told me a lot about you . Like what ? That you never cried as a baby . She was like a little porcupine . Still is . So don 't get too close . It 's late . I have to get Corey to bed . See you , Corey . Remember . Remember what ? My babysitter , he can 't die . Come on . You 're in a world of pain , Tommy . We got you on burg 2 , possession of a controlled substance , possession of burglar 's tools- - Matt gave me a key . We 'll check that out with him . Wait a second . We can 't . He 's dead . Murder 2 . You 're trippin ' . All right ? I wasn 't anywhe near Matt 's place on saturday night . Really ? We found this earring in Matt 's bed . How 'd you lose it , Tommy ? During sex ? You boys have a lovers ' quarrel ? You don 't think I 'm straight ? Think I can prove it to you . You wouldn 't last the night . We deciphered your little code . You 're going down for this . My father gets here , and I 'll be out in a minute . On a murder charge ? You can forget bail . Daddy can 't help you now . Only we can . Ok . We sold a little blow . All right ? Matt needed the money . He couldn 't make it on scholarship alone . You ever deal roofies ? That 's for sleazebags . Your notes showed you owed your supplier large . What happened ? Look , I just asked Matt to borrow some product . But he said no , so you got into it . He was alive when I left . I swear . Ask Marika Soloway . She was there ? They were getting back together . I left before she did . You ever sail , Tommy ? You good with knots ? I get seasick . Hello , George . I want you to show miss Brown to my table when she arrives , ok ? This arrived for you , sir . " My darling , my father was right . " I was living in a wonderland . " But this is reality . " I can 't see you anymore . " Please don 't call me or try to contact me , " and please don 't hate me . Lily . Oh , detectives , this is my husband Paul Cleary . He was Matt 's coach . Paul . We 'd like to speak with you later . Whatever I can do . Look , I can 't do this now . I 'm speaking at the service . We can always go downtown . I hate this school . Tommy Langer . He 's such a loser . Did you see him at Matt 's that day ? The truth , Marika . They had a fight , ok ? Over drugs ? Why 'd you lie before about being there ? My family , they 're like beyond WASP . They will disown me when they find out I was seeing him . You got back together ? That day . He was alive when I left . And we believe that why ? You don 't believe me ? Stay for the service . But what made Matt special wasn 't the 4 : 25 mile he ran . The race he was really interested in was the human race . Dray is a family . And it 's lost one of its own . Down , down , down into the darkness of the grave , gently they go , the beautiful , the tender , the kind . Quietly they go . The intelligent , the witty , the brave . You are all such hypocrites . Where were you when he needed you ? " Dray is a family " ? Please . Matt had to deal drugs just to keep up . Coach 's words are nice , now . But why did he kick Matt off the track team ? And the teacher he went to for help , mrs . Cleary , well , here 's how that bitch was helping . You see ? We all killed Matt . Ain 't life grand ? Marika said she and Matt had the same kind of cell phone . When she left his place , she took the wrong one . The pictures were on it . Well , at least now we know who the killer is . Everyone . Are you here to arrest me ? Matt was 17 . You beat the law by a year . Lucky me . Want to tell me what happened ? We fell in love . Did your husband know ? He found some emails . That 's why he kicked Matt off the team . He was furious . Understandably . Where was your husband that night ? He was at the movies . You know which one ? No . You think what I did was wrong . I 'm not a judge . Everybody else is . Society makes these distinctions between right and wrong , but the heart doesn 't . It feels what it wants to feel . You like to sail . I used to . So after you found out about the affair , you confronted Matt ? You have to understand that I gave this kid everything . He had talent , but no technique . He could have been major . A--I don 't know- - a Jim Ryan . And he pays me back by sleeping with my wife . I wanted to kill him . So did you ? Where were you that night ? I went to the movies . Alone ? I had some thinking to do . Anyone see you there ? I don 't know . What movie ? I didn 't kill that boy . What movie ? School . How may I help you ? I 'm working with the home secretary , and we 're doing a background check on Hannah Cleary . Understand she taught there . Yes , but I 'm not at liberty to say- - Of course . Silly of me . How is the old school ? God , I miss it . It never changes . That 's its charm . Quite . The prince and I were just talking of that . The prince ? Yes . We went to Trinity together . I misunderstood , man . I really shouldn 't , but the word was that mrs . Cleary was inappropriate with a student , a sixth-former , then she left . It was all very hush-hush . You 're doing your country a service . Well , she was a fisherman 's daughter . What can you expect ? Guess what we found on Cleary 's laptop ? He 's been visiting kinky websites . One has photos of sexual asphyxiation . He didn 't do it . We found a bottle of rohypnol in his locker . Of course . You think he 's being set up ? I think the heart doesn 't distinguish between right and wrong . Is that a yes ? Because the lieutenant wants us to lean on him really hard . What 's the story ? Looks like an O.D. Guy offed himself . Wife came home and found him . Sure it wasn 't accidental ? He left this . A suicide note . And more . Yeah , I know . A confession . ? ? ? ? You know I hate that . What ? When you make me think you know something , but you won 't tell me what you think you know . This is the sound of me hanging up . See these ts ? Too regular , too perfect . Look at this , 36 . This little tag at the second " o " in honor . It 's like the writer started to write a " U. " Maybe out of habit , maybe because she was used to spelling it the british way . It 's not bad work . For an art teacher from Brighton . But I could do better . Though he would not amplify or affirm the contents , it can only be a formal declaration of war against Japan , Germany and Italy . Here in New York ... at least uncle sam wants me . Name- - Johann Van Der Zee . Date of birth- - june 1 , 1607 . Place of birth- - Amsterdam , Holland . So that 's the end of the story , huh , 29 ? You know , Lily did me a favor . She got me to join the army . Maybe if I 'm lucky , I 'll get killed . I don 't understand . Why did you read me my rights ? A formality . We just have a few questions . Please sit down . It has been a hellish week . I 'm sure you understand . Oh , I understand . I thought you 'd like to take a look at this . I 've already read the suicide note . I- - of course , but this is a note we found in your husband 's office . I really think you should read it . What is this ? Some kind of joke ? That would make you the punchline . Paul couldn 't have written this ! It looks like his handwriting . It 's a lie . Is it ? Which part , Hannah ? Where it says that Paul wanted to set the record straight in case something happened to him ? Or where it says that you killed Matt because you were crazy with jealousy . I don 't have to listen to this ! And Matt called you that day , told you he was getting back with Marika . That you flipped out , drove to Matt 's place , spiked his drink , tied his hands with a knot only a fisherman 's daughter would use . Now which part ? Which part is the lie ? I gave Matt everything , and he threw it all away . And you overdosed your husband and forged his confession . Rohypnol 's legal in England , isn 't it ? Paul figured it out . I had no choice . The way I felt about Matt ... you will never know that kind of love . I hope not . What are you doing ? I never said Paul wrote the letter . I only said it looked like his handwriting . Just wanted to let you know we moved back into our place . Irene feels like she can sleep there again . That 's good . Yeah . It 's a start . You kept your promise . You never liked to practice . My hands were too small . You ever see Oscar Peterson 's hands ? Ham hocks . Thought you should have this . There 's an inscription to your mother . It 'll tell you what you need to know . How is he ? 10 fingers , 10 toes . We 're just washing him up . You all alone , honey ? We 're going to need the father 's name . John York . Took 3 trains to get here . Did I miss it ? I never thought I 'd see you again . How did you know ? Well , let 's just say my secretary takes an unusual interest in my personal life . That 's why you sent me the letter . I found out that day . - I didn 't see another way - - No , that 's the past . How 's the baby ? Beautiful . In a scrunched up kind of way . It 's for you . Figured you 'd need some sleep . You will always le the one I loved your mother , Omar . She was fierce , brave . What ? How 'd you find this ? A lot of firemen come in here , buy a few drinks . You 'd be surprised what you could learn . You had the ambulance number wrong . It was 7-8-9 . The 8 looked like a 3 . She 's an E.R. Doc at St. Francis . Her name is Sara Dillane . Maybe you ought to go find her . Yeah . See you later . the 4 line poem of Omar Khayyam : There was a boy a very strange , enchanted boy give the man his son . They say he wandered very far very far so what are we going to call our golden boy ? Over land and sea how about after our favorite poet ? That 's perfect . It means " he who speaks . " Omar . Fools and kings that 's a good name . This he said to me the greatest thing you 'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return

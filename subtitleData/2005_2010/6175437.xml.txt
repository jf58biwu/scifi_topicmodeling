 Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future . The 21st century is when everything changes . And you 've gotta be ready . Owen , Gwen , left into the alley , right , 30 metres . What is it ? What can you see ? I can 't get a visual , just a signal . Definitely alien in origin . Diagonal right , towards the castle . Watch it ! Jack , sharp right , 20 metres . - Can you identify the target ? - Still trying to get a visual . 20 seconds to contact . Fifteen seconds . No heroics . We 've got no idea what we 're dealing with . Ten seconds . Got it ! Got a visual ! Suspect 's male . Wearing a hoodie . Go , Gwen ! Oi ! - Come on ! Open it up ! - All right , all right . Hey ! What are you doing ? MAN 2 : In trouble now , mate . You tell him . Watch it ! - You star ! You did it ! - Oh , I was that close . - No , you got him . - I 've lost him , Tosh . I 've lost him . I swear , whatever it is , you 're holding it . Let me check . Hang on . Hello . Who are you ? - Can you hear me ? - I want to go home . No one knows who I am here . I 'm lost . Come back . Sorry . That damn gate cut us off . Gwen , are you all right ? I 've just seen a ghost . This is the feed from the station camera . Gwen grabs the kid . She 's got his jacket and he just slips out . - You okay with this ? - And then ? Jack and Owen arrive . - And then nothing . Sorry . - No , it ... It was as real as this is . More real . I didn 't just see that little boy . I could ... I could hear what he was thinking . I could feel it . Like I was lost . Intense emotion can be part of a neurological event . - Hallucinations , dementia . - I wasn 't hallucinating , Owen . And I 'm not bloody senile . You pushed this button and that caused this apparition moment ? Yeah . - Jack , no ! - Jack , please don 't ... As if ! But that 's how it felt . Like an apparition . A ghost . Toshiko , where do we start ? The guy you were chasing , I 've got lots of CCTV so tracking him down is going to be easy . The little boy ? You said there was a name on the card around his neck ? - Flanagan . Tom Erasmus Flanagan . - Unusual name . That 'll help . Run a full check . Births , marriages , deaths , criminal record , passports . However long it takes , wherever he is , we 'll find him . Found him ! Flanagan , Thomas Erasmus . 74 Brynaeron Terrace , Butetown . He 's in the phone book . Hi , I 'm DI Cooper . This is DS Harper . - Could you spare a few minutes , please ? - Yeah , okay . Thanks . - Dad , visitors . It 's the police . - Oh , caught up with me at last , have you ? I 'm Gwen . This is Owen . He 's training . It 's just routine . We 're looking for eyewitnesses to an incident at the railway station last night . We were here , weren 't we , Dad ? Strictly Come Dancing finals . - Who won ? - That newsreader . Oh , she 's got legs up to her armpits , hasn 't she ? - Would you like a cup of tea ? - I 'd love one , thanks . - Owen will give you a hand . - Oh , this way . - She 'll talk him to death out there . - He 'll give as good as he gets . She was right , though . We were in all last night . We wouldn 't have seen anything . Just for the record . You are Tom Erasmus Flanagan . My father was an Erasmus . His father before him . Now , that 's not a Welsh accent , is it ? No . Lived here 66 years and still sound like a barrow boy . I was evacuated during the war . 1941 . The Germans bombing the hell out of the East End . Cardiff was being bombed as well as London , wasn 't it ? We were taken out to the countryside from here . My mother packed me a suitcase . Big sister wrote my name on a card . They put me on a train at Paddington . Kept saying I had to go , to be a good boy . Telling me not to cry . And there was the pair of them , crying their eyes out . That was the last I saw of them , though I didn 't know that then , of course , waving goodbye . - How old were you ? - Eight . - You must have been very , very frightened . - I didn 't know a soul here . There was a mix-up . I 'd kept my head down so much , they forgot all about me . So they left me all on my own . It felt like the end of the world . I wandered down this tunnel . Totally lost . Forgotten . Looking for someone , anyone who would look after me . " Why don 't they come for me ? " I kept thinking . " No one knows me . I 'm lost . " They worked it out in the end . They came back for me , and I got taken in by a lovely couple . No kids of their own . And , well , at the end of the war , I 'd no one left in London so I stayed here . I 'm still here now . Just . I don 't get it . He was the boy at the station . I can 't comment . I was stuck in the kitchen with motor mouth thanks to you . So was what I saw just a bit of him from years before sort of hanging around ? - Hi . - Gwen ? Er , I 'm just putting a wash on . You got any whites need doing ? I don 't know . Just leave it . I 'll sort it out . Oh , no , no , it 's no trouble . Just remind me , which drawer do the tablets go in ? - Oh , just leave it . - Okay , then . So are you in or out tonight ? - I don 't know . - Again ? - I 'm sorry ? - What I 'm asking is you in or out tonight ? I don 't know . Gwen , I can live with all the Secret Squirrel stuff , but if you can 't even tell me if you 're coming home ... - Well , nagging isn 't helping . - Right . Well , that 's me told . Oh , Rhys ... Well , I 'm not staying in on the off-chance . Dav 's having mates round tonight . I 'll stay at his . You do what you want . Hello ? All right . Our friend with the alien machine in his pocket is one Sean Harris , AKA Bernie . And what he 's doing with an alien machine is anyone 's guess . 19 years old . String of convictions , burglary , shoplifting , credit cards . Do warn me if he 's dropping in . The theft conviction . He was stealing tyres off a car when the owner turns up , gives him so much grief he apologies , starts putting them back on again , which is when the police show up . And here , shoplifting conviction . Bottle of vodka and three Pot Noodles . Criminal mastermind . Got anywhere with that mystery object ? Alien , of course . Gorgeous nanotechnology . Makes NASA look like " Toys R Us " . You 've really narrowed things down , haven 't you ? At the station it was doing this . And when I held it , it lit up and went mad . - It 's not doing it now , is it ? - No . So , what next ? This kid , Bernie , where does he live ? - Splott . - Splott ? I believe estate agents pronounce it " splow " . - Hi , I 'm looking for Bernie . Is he in ? - Friends of his , are you ? - Yes , I 'm from ... - Well , I 'm his mother , and he 's a robbing little bastard who 's not setting a foot in this house till he pays me the 50 quid he owes me . He 's barred . He said he 'd give me an iPod and he never , and he smoked my fags . Wouldn 't piss on him if he was on fire . Bernie Harris , the scarlet pimpernel of Splott . Tell me about it . Give me aliens any day . - Any luck ? - No . But I got four pasties for a pound . Anyone ? If I 'd wanted days like this , I 'd have stayed in the police . We did try , Jack . What 's he gonna tell us ? Got it off an alien down the market ? Where are we going ? Back to the railway station . Controlled experiment . We replicate the original events as far as possible , observe and analyze the results . - What , I have to do that again ? - Someone does . - Any volunteers ? - Whoa . - We don 't know what it is , what it does . - No . - Jack , this could be dangerous . - Yeah . I don 't mean to be picky , but I think I can spot some flaws in this plan ... I 'm sorry , I thought you were the guys who gave up looking for a 19-year-old kid this morning ? I figured maybe you were after something more exciting . A bit of a challenge . His door-to-door stuff never gets us anywhere . Guys ! Come here . - Owen ! Owen ! - Wait ! Oh , he 's a rotten bastard . My mum was right . His eyes are too close together . I said just a dance , but he wasn 't having a bar of it . I shouldn 't have gone outside with him . I should have known better . - What 's your name ? - Lizzie . Lizzie Lewis . You 're a bad one , Ed Morgan . The girls said not to go with you and they were right . Am I bad ? Am I a bad boy ? You 're a big girl now , Lizzie . You can make your own decisions . That 's why I like you . You 're not like the others . You don 't follow the herd . You 're smart . Don 't you like it that someone can see how smart you are ? Hmm ? I can see you , Lizzie . The way you really are . I don 't want to hurt you . I don 't . I ... I told my mum I 'd be home by 9 : 00 . Shh ... Please ! No ! Don 't hurt me ! - Help me ! Help me ! - Please . - Owen . Owen , are you all right ? - She was so scared . I couldn 't ... I couldn 't move . I couldn 't move . I couldn 't move . The first time it happens to Gwen . A boy at the railway station . Who 's now in his 70s , alive and well , and living in Butetown . Second time , it happens to Owen . Like me , you didn 't just see it . You felt emotions that weren 't yours . She was terrified . The victim 's name was Lizzie . It was maybe 40 , 45 years ago . Toshiko , do we know anything about her yet ? Elizabeth Lewis , Lizzie . Only child of Mabel Ann Lewis of Hatford Street . Died March 29th , 1963 . Raped and murdered on Penfro Street , under the bridge . 17 years old . - He killed her . - No one was brought to trial . She told her mum she 'd be home by 9 : 00 . So what about Ed Morgan ? That 's what she called him . " You 're a bad one , Ed Morgan . " Look him up . It 's kind of a common name . What 's the connection ? Where did they come from ? It 's like being haunted . Quantum transducer ! Look ! - Wow . - I 'd kill to get one of those . Transducers convert energy from one form into another . They 're in headphones . They convert electrical signals into sound . And they 're in this device , too , converting quantum energy and amplifying it ... Into ghosts . Of course . It 's emotion . Human emotion is energy . You can 't always see it or hear it , but you can feel it . Ever had déjá vu ? Felt someone walk over your grave ? Ever felt someone behind you in an empty room ? - Well , there was . There always is . - A ghost . What else have we got on Lizzie Lewis ? What else have we got ? Um , 1963 . The records aren 't always that detailed . What about newspapers , witness statements , coroner 's reports ? - Owen ! - What do you want me to find exactly ? There must be something . For the case to be reopened , you need new evidence or a new witness . - I saw it happen . - No , you didn 't . You weren 't there ! You saw the echo of a moment amplified by alien technology . So just tell me how that 'll play in court ? Well , since when did we care about court ? Tomorrow we go looking for Bernie Harris , and we find out what he knows about this ghost machine . We do our job and find where this thing came from . Now , go home ! Gwen , with me ! Jack ? Whoa ! You need to know how to use these . I hope you never have to . So , do I ... I 'm sorry , it 's just ... I don 't even kill spiders in the bath . Nor do I. Not with a gun . It 's all yours . - Target 's that way . - Right . Let 's leave the roof in one piece , shall we ? One hand , not two . Turn sideways to the target . Looking along your shoulder , down your arm . Straight line to the sights . Bring up the gun . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Too fast . It 's all in the breathing . Hold it firmly . Don 't grip it . Breathe in . Focus . Breathe out . Squeeze gently . Wow . That was a joint effort . Try it again . This time on your own and remember ... Don 't grip it too tight . - Hold it . Cock it back . - You cock it , I ... Nice and slow . Up a little . Yeah . Breathe first , then go . You can stick your hands like this , but you don 't have to . - Two hands or one ? - One hand . - Woo-hoo ! - Wow . Nice work . Like I said , I hope you never have to use them . Oh , God . Look at the time . When do you get to go home ? You seem to live here . You don 't , do you ? Got to be ready . The 21st century is when it all changes . And I hate to commute . - Where do you sleep ? - I don 't . Doesn 't it get lonely at night ? I 'd better get back . Rhys 'll be wondering where I am . - Good night . - Night . Hello ! Hi , it 's me here . I 'm at Dav 's playing poker , and I 'm winning ! Hey , hey ! Look , just so you know , I put your whites on earlier , even though you were bloody grumpy . They 're still in the machine so you 'll need to hang them up . I put the bins out , but I didn 't do the washing-up . But there 's not much of that , so ... But you haven 't done it in weeks anyway . Um , I 'll see you when I see you . Ta-ra . Lizzie . - Lizzie Lewis . - You 're a bad one , Ed Morgan . Are you there ? The girls said not to go with you and they were right . Am I bad ? Lizzie . Am I a bad boy ? - Lizzie Lewis . - Help me ! Help me ! So , I ... I 've got to stay out of trouble now , have I ? Best behaviour . I 'm a fully trained police officer . I 'll have you on the floor and handcuffed like that . Hmm , promises , promises . I 'm so proud of you . Rhys ? The taxi 's here . We 're gonna be late . I haven 't worn these since the Luckley 's interview . I 'll wear jeans with a shirt and tie . It 's Mum 's 60th . She wanted us all smart . That 's the whole point . Yeah , but I bust my zip . I 'll be flashing my family allowance if I 'm not careful . - What are you doing with that ? - Come on . - Are you joking ? - I 'll staple it . You are not coming near my valuables with that . What happens if I need a pee ? Hiya . Dav and Karen had a barney . She 's making him sleep in the spare room . Didn 't fancy the sofa . Look , I don 't mind you working all the hours . I really don 't . Just as long as you still want to come home at the end of it all . I do . I 'm here and you 're gorgeous . - I bet you haven 't done the washing-up . - No . - Let 's leave it till tomorrow , eh ? - Aye . - Who is it ? - Mr Morgan ? - What do you want ? Well ? - Mr Morgan . I need to come in . Who said there was gas ? I can 't smell anything . There 's nothing wrong or I 'd have noticed . Can you smell anything ? Was it next door ? Can we go into the living room , Mr Morgan ? There 's nothing in here . No gas fire , I mean . I haven 't got one . There 's an electric heater . I don 't hardly use it . What are you looking for ? - Sit down , Mr Morgan . - Was it next door ? She can 't mind her own business . There 's something wrong with her . She makes stuff up . Is it her ? You won 't find anything if it is . It 's all in her head . Know what I mean ? What 's your name ? - How long have you lived here , Mr Morgan ? - Years . This was my mam 's house . You 'd remember your neighbours ? People who lived in this street a while ago ? People who lived just around the corner ? Like in Hatford Street ? Like Mabel Lewis ? She only passed away a few years ago , did you know ? Of course , she 'd moved away long before that . Couldn 't bear the memories . Her daughter , her only child , died in ' 63 . Lizzie . Little Lizzie Lewis . She loved dancing , do you remember ? You should . Pretty girl . Blonde hair , blue eyes . Used to wear a little pink coat . Bet she saved all her pennies to get that . All the rage . She was wearing it the last time you saw her . Last time anyone saw her alive . Remember now ? I know what happened under the bridge that night . Just the two of you in the dark . Water dripping from the roof into the canal . Lizzie 's hair all wet from the rain , cold and crying . I know what you did , Ed Morgan . Here you are , just living your life . Free as a bird . Lizzie told her mother she 'd be home at 9 : 00 , didn 't she ? " Please don 't , " she said . " Please ! " Please ! " You 're a bad one , Ed Morgan . " The girls said not to go with you and they were right . " Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! You thought you 'd get away with this , didn 't you ? You 'll get nothing from me ! I 've told you before . You 'll get nothing from me ! Get out of my house ! Get out of my house ! Bernie Harris ! Oi ! - Do you mind ... - Sorry ! Go on ! Kick his head in ! Dad , there 's a man in the garden ! There 's two men in the garden ! - Bernie Harris . - Who ? That wasn 't a question . - Don 't hurt me , please . I 've got asthma . - I 'm not going to hurt you . I 'm going to bloody kill you . Why do they call you Bernie ? I burned my neighbor 's shed down when I was 12 . What for ? I was just having a fag . Got a bit carried away like . Well , this is cosy . I hope he bought you flowers . If this is all about the dodgy fags , I don 't know , I don 't know what happened to them , all right ? Well , it 's worth knowing we 're probably the only people you can tell . Me and a mate was using this lock-up down on Moira Street . It used to belong to this old guy . Soft in the head , he was . There was still loads of his stuff in there , but we chucked most of it . There was this old biscuit tin full of foreign coins , weird bits of rock and that . Thought it might be worth something . I might take it down - the Antiques Roadshow or something . - Yeah . Well , you don 't know , do you ? Cash in the attic and all that . So I takes the tin home with me and that thing starts switching itself on . It makes you see things . Real things . Real people . I was down at the old wharf in the bay . I seen this woman with a bundle . Something wrapped up . It was night-time and she was putting it into the water , all secret like . It was weird ' cause it was like I was her somehow . She was scared . She knew what she was doing was wrong . I knew without seeing it was her baby , wrapped up , dead . She hadn 't told anyone . Then she just ran away . And I realised I knew her . She 's old now , but she lives up by the Catholic church in Splott . So I goes up to see her , told her what I 'd seen and she give me money not to tell anyone else . - You blackmailed her ? - She offered . Look , I 've seen things you wouldn 't believe . There 's the old bridge on Penfro Street . I saw a man and a girl from ages ago . He was following her back from a dance along the canal ... Yeah , I know . I saw it . He doesn 't know anything , does he ? Bernie , it 's been fascinating meeting you . Hang on ! Where are you going ? That 's mine , that is . You can 't just walk off . I got rights . Oh , so you don 't want the other half , then ? The other half . Weird bits of rock . Foreign money . Alien rock . Alien money . - Driftwood , washing in through the rift . - Tosh . So , Bernie , was this thing in two halves when you found it ? I got it . Like clicking Lego together . You split this into two pieces , didn 't you ? Come on , you lot . We 'll take these , too , if you don 't mind . - Come on , you lot . - Aren 't you gonna arrest me ? No . We 're not the police . - But I robbed that . - I know . - And you 're gonna rob it back off me ? - So call the cops . Don 't go ! I only used it once . That half anyway . I couldn 't use it again . - Why not ? - I 'm gonna die . I 've seen it happen . Out there on the road . I 'm just lying there , bleeding and then I die . Just like I am now . Not old . - What do you mean ? - Come on , Gwen . I 'm going to be 20 in July . Do I die before then ? Gwen ! Just wait there . I 'm coming back . Jack ? Jack ! Jack , I need to speak to you . Gwen , no ! Hello . Help me , please . I was too late . I couldn 't stop it . Stop what ? He 's dead . Owen had the knife . - He wanted to kill him . - Owen ? Oh , God , I couldn 't stop it ! Help me ! Christ , Gwen , what were you thinking ? I didn 't see him . I didn 't see anyone but me . Just said his name . Owen . Bernie said he saw himself dead in that street . You saw Owen with the knife . But I was holding it . My hands were covered in blood . That was one future . One of many possible futures . Whatever you saw , what Bernie saw , might not happen . Might not ? Can 't we find out ? You 've got all this stuff . Alien stuff . Isn 't there anything that can help ? I 'm sorry . I wish we 'd never found it . Poor Bernie , seeing himself dead . - Well , he might not be . - Mmm , possible futures . - He might like to know that . - You 're certainly finding it a comfort . I don 't know what to do . I found your Ed Morgan earlier . Did a trace . I found him , too . Phone book . It took all night , but I found him . I paid him a visit this morning . Put the fear of God into him . - What did you find ? - His medical records . He 's claustrophobic , paranoid , depressive . Got a couple of recorded attempts of suicide . He 's barely left his house in years . - Look , Owen , if Jack finds out ... - Well , he won 't , will he ? Hello ? I think he thought I wanted money . He kept saying , " You 'll get nothing from me . " - Paranoia . - Yeah . He said , " You 'll get nothing from me . Leave me alone . - " I 've told you before . " - Told who ? Look , I 've seen things you wouldn 't believe . There 's the old bridge down on Penfro Street . It was a man and a girl from ages ago . He was following her back from a dance along the canal . Bernie , it 's Gwen . Can I come in ? Thanks . I know it sounds mad , but just because you saw yourself ... Dead , yeah ? - It doesn 't mean it 's going to happen . - But you don 't know how to stop it . For you or for me . It 's got right into my head , this thing . Some things you 're just better off not knowing . - Jack . - Ed Morgan . Owen went freelance earlier . Decided to pay him a visit . Wanted to frighten him . Sounds like he succeeded . I think our friend Bernie Harris got there first , tried to blackmail him . Bernie was blackmailing him ? Looks that way . Ed thought Owen was part of the same outfit . - Are you home yet ? - No , I 'm at Bernie 's place . We 're heading over . Stay right there . Owen , with me . Tosh , keep an eye on CCTV in case Bernie makes a run for it . So you saw Ed Morgan assaulting that girl , too , and you thought you 'd make some money out of it ? " Diagnosed severe depression , agoraphobic ... " No . I don 't believe this . Jack ? I 'm on CCTV and I 'm looking at Ed Morgan . - What ? Where is he ? - Coming on to Evelyn Street . That 's Bernie 's street . He 's heading for Bernie 's flat . What , are we expecting someone ? Where are you going ? Bernie ! Bernie ! - Jack ? Yeah , what the hell is going on ? - We 're on our way . Are you okay ? Yeah , I would be if someone would just ... Just tell me ... I 'm gonna die . I 've seen it happen . Out there on the road . Bernie said he saw himself dead in that road . Gwen ? Gwen ! I knew you 'd find me in the end . I knew you 'd come for me . I 've been waiting for years . Have you come for me , too ? I used to see it in people 's faces when they looked at me . They knew . I tried to hide , but they knew . I haven 't been outside for so long . - Edwin ... - Little bitch ! You 're all the same . You blame me and make me the bad one . - Edwin , put the knife down . - I wasted my life for you . We won 't tell anyone . No one else is gonna know . Stay calm . I won 't breathe a word . You 'll never see me again , I promise . I know . That 's why I came . It 's what you want , isn 't it ? Got him ! Drop the knife . - Are we okay ? - I got it . - Are we okay ? - Yeah , yeah , we 're okay . I 've got the knife . I 've got the knife , Edwin . You were so close . You were going for her , weren 't you ? Just like with Lizzie . I 've got the knife , Edwin . You were so close . As close as I am now . Owen had the knife . He wanted to kill him . - Why should you get away with it ? - Owen ! You said you were sorry . You said you didn 't want to hurt her , but you didn 't stop . - Owen ! - What if I didn 't stop ? Would I be sorry ? Owen , no ! I don 't know . Go and deal with Bernie ! It didn 't happen . No one died . You stopped it from happening . You got here in time . I knew you 'd come for me ... He 's arresting ! Help me . I was so close . I couldn 't stop it . Oh , God . Oh , God . I couldn 't ... I couldn 't ... I couldn 't ... I couldn 't stop it . He wanted to die . He would have found a way , no matter what . I screwed up . I know I did . But ... But I didn 't kill him . I could have , but I didn 't . - No , I did . - Tosh is right . It could have been anyone . What about that ? The problem with seeing the future is you can 't just sit and look at it . You got to try and change things . Make it happen differently . It 's not meant for us . All these ghosts . We 'd be lost . The sun 's nearly up . - Ianto . - Secure archives . Come on . I killed him . I 've still got blood on my hands . He killed himself . Come on , Gwen . Look , the sun 's coming up . - A new day . - The city will be awake soon . - All those people , all that energy . - All those ghosts . We 're surrounded by them . We can 't see them , we can 't touch them ... but they 're there all right . A million shadows of human emotion . We 've just got to learn to live with them . - What 's happening ? - Internal power drain . - What the hell is it ? - It 's wrong . It 's beyond wrong . It shouldn 't be here . We have found parts of a cyber conversion unit , fully powered up and working . I 'm deadly serious . Oh , God . There she is . If she 's still alive , you execute her .

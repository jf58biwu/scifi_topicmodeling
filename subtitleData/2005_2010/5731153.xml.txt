 JACK : Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race . The 2 1 st century is when everything changes and Torchwood is ready . ( MOBILE PHON E BEEPING ) ( CH UCKLES ) Cheeky bugger . ( WIN D HOWLING ) AN DY : Jonah Bevan , born 15th of February , 1993 . Son of N ikki Bevan and Paul Millet . 14 Cliffs Rise , Penarth . Disappeared walking home from football practise . Been missing now for seven months and eleven days . No body , no sighting since that night . Disappeared right where we 're standing . Mmm-hmm . Which is where we found this . He sent a text to his mum , she was looking out the window and they waved to each other . - She 's certain everywhere was deserted . - What about the investigation ? Usual procedures , searched the home , checked the computer , spoken to all known friends and relatives , made publicity appeals . But no significant leads ... Look , sorry , - is this beneath you now ? - No . Then what 's with the attitude ? You got a face like a slapped arse . I 'm waiting for you to tell me where you were . - Where I was when ? - At the wedding . I rang you , I had to work . Temple changed the rota at the last minute . - You know how it is . - I checked the duty logs , you weren 't working , you had three days off . - What , are you spying on me now ? - I thought we were mates . - And you just don 't turn up ? - Just thought ... Being as Rhys has got a problem with me ... Rhys thinks you 're great . It 's you who has a problem with him . Ever since I 've known you , you 've made sarky comments about his weight . He could stand to lose a couple of pounds . Let it go ! Let it go . Yeah , well , I can 't . All right ? I don 't want to sit there and watch you pledge your stupid life to him . I 've got better things to do of a Saturday . Happy now ? - Oh , Andy ! - Get off . I thought we 'd been through all this , you 're a lovely fella and stuff . I 'm not like a bloody tap , I can 't just switch it off . But this was like what , three years ago ? I mean , look , I didn 't know ... I didn 't realise you still had feelings . I don 't , all right ? I just had a moment . - Don 't flatter yourself . - ( CH UCKLING ) Okay . - If you want to talk about it ... - I want to talk about this kid . - Jonah . - Teenagers go missing all the time . I mean , why is this one so special ? I was the first one here . I sat with his mum all night and all the next day . And every time I tell her we got nothing new , I see a bit of her die . Anything strange about the case ? Like you don 't know . ( WOMAN CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO ) - What ... What just happened ? - Exactly . AN DY : The camera records one frame every six seconds . He could 've done a lot in six seconds , jumped over the side , hidden somewhere . No , he 's looking at something . Look , something is glowing just out of the camera 's line of sight , like a flare . It 's not there the previous frame or the next . Could be one of the lights on the barrage . All right , stop lying . You know what happened here , - why aren 't you telling me ? - What are you talking about , Andy ? Right . Forty-five minutes later ... What 's your mate Mulder doing there ? GWEN : Jack ? No recognisable rift activity around the barrage on that date . - What about if you tried ... - I ran checks for three months either side then extended the radius by a mile and checked again . - Still nothing . - Okay . Thanks . - When did you say this was ? - It was about seven months back . Any reason you 'd be on the barrage that night ? They have this cute little coffee shack , I sometimes stop by there . A boy went missing just under an hour before you were there . - Okay . - Jonah Bevan , 15 years old . I thought maybe you were out there because of him . Maybe if we 'd registered rift activity . No , I just checked with Tosh , it was all clear . Sorry , can 't help . - Want me to look into it for you ? - No , it 's fine . - So it was just a coincidence , then ? - I guess so . Gotta run . Weevil hunting with Ianto . ( POLICE SIREN WAILING ) WOMAN : Ah-choo . ( MAN CH UCKLING ) AN DY : Oh , I like that . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) So , you 're covering it up , then ? Jack said it was a coincidence . I can 't help . Thanks a lot . Should 've known . Bloody Torchwood . Fob me off , why don 't you ? No , if there was something going on , I would tell you . Do you know what 's happened to you , Gwen ? You 've got hard . Yeah ? Well , maybe I 've had to . You used to care . You used to be bothered about people . Don 't matter who they were or what they did . And now you sit here talking about coincidence , like people go missing all the time , like it 's a fact of life . The old Gwen would 've been up there to see N ikki Bevan in a flash . You 're one of them now , aren 't you ? Too busy to bother with one missing child . What is it ? Not major enough for you ? Not spooky enough ? Sorry to bother you . ( DOOR BELL RINGING ) N ikki Bevan ? Gwen Cooper . I 'm working with the police on Jonah 's disappearance . - Andy said you might be round . - Oh , he did , did he ? Reckons you 've got a different area of expertise . What is it , forensics ? - I 'm just a fresh eye . - Oh , sorry about the mess . Wow , film fan , are you ? - Crowds . - Sorry ? It 's all crowd footage , ever since he went . Football matches , concerts , festivals . Anywhere there 's a crowd , I record it . Go through it frame by frame , checking every face . Sometimes I think it 's him . But the picture 's so grainy , I spend hours looking at one corner of the screen . But then the next day , I check again and it 's not . It 's the hope that 's killing me . - Even if you saw him , what would you do ? - Find someone that was with him . If I could just let him know I saw him . He 's got to be out there somewhere . Do you think I 'm mad ? No , I think you 'd make a great police woman . This room 's as he left it ? I sleep in here some nights . Bury my head in the pillow . It still smells of him . Except the more I do it , the more it smells like me . I keep his diary for him . I sit in here and I imagine I 'm him . - What do you think I did wrong ? - Sorry ? Maybe I was to nosy . Or not interested enough . Maybe he felt unloved . All I 've got is questions . - What about Jonah 's dad ? - We were only together about six weeks . I thought when he first went missing and he was all over the telly that his dad might get in touch , but no . Still manages to disappoint . Oh , hang on . Andy tried to find me a support group , but there weren 't any . So I thought I 'd set one up myself . - It 's our first meeting , will you come ? - Oh , I don 't know . Andy 'll be there . And I 'm gonna do food . Oh , come on , I don 't want to be sat there on my own . I 'll try . I 've got to go . - I 'm sorry , I know I 'm late . - Three hours ! It was a work thing , time just got away from me . Ooh , wine . We can do it another time , though , yeah ? This is the fourth another time , Gwen . - You said you 'd cook . - Did I ? - When are we going to have this talk ? - Let 's do it now . Come on , now is good . I 'm ready . - Babies . Now . - Really ? - Do you think I 've changed ? - Eh ? Since I joined Torchwood , am I different ? - Why ? - It 's just something Andy said . Okay , let me just tell you this one thing , okay ? - Okay , go on . - He still fancies me . Don 't laugh , Rhys . That 's why he didn 't come to the wedding . - Bloody hell , poor sod . - Oi ! I 'm a very sexy lady and you are a very lucky man . Just remember that , okay ? We 're not going to talk about kids tonight , are we ? We could do some practising . ( BOTH CH UCKLING ) - GWEN : Tell me you love me . - Give me the toast . Oh , come on , tell me you love me first . - Give me the toast ! - Tell me you love me . ( MOBILE PHON E RINGING ) - Gwen . - H i , Tosh . I 've dug up some new data on that night at the barrage . I think you might want to take a look at it . I 'll be right there . - Deserting me , are you ? - Yep . - GWEN : Ugh , crumbs . - Oi ! Hey , what 've you got ? It 's barely a blip on the system . So insignificant I 've been ignoring it . But when I looked closer ... This is what we recognise as standard rift activity . But what I discovered is a negative rift spike that occurred at the time you 're querying . Now , we 've always assumed that these readings were residual rift flares . Like an aftershock . But because this one coincided with Jonah 's disappearance , I think we 've been misinterpreting . - Okay , so ... - So , we 've always believed that things can only come through the rift one way . What if we 're wrong ? What if the rift doesn 't just leave stuff behind ? What if it also takes ? - Who else have you told about this ? - No one . I called you as soon as I realised . But it could be a coincidence or an anomaly . I can 't be sure unless I can cross-reference it with other examples . Tosh , can we keep this to ourselves ? There 's something I have to do . Whatever you think is best . Thank you so much , you 're such a sweetheart . - You 're looking into it , then ? - Still the same old me . Thank you . Yeah , well , I don 't know why I bother , you 're so rude . How 's Rhys ? Other than hungry . - Oh . It 's you two . - AN DY : Oh , that 's nice . I thought there 'd be more here by now . - It 's going to just be me , isn 't it ? - I 'm sure it won 't . People will come . Yeah , yeah , you know , " If you build it , they will come . " Field ofDreams . No ? Just me , then . Anyway , sit down . It is going to be just us , isn 't it ? ( KNOCKING ) - H i , we 're looking for N ikki . - Yeah , that 's me . Come in . It 's brilliant you found us . There 's food there , drinks , so help yourself . - Is this missing persons ? - Yeah , come in . Do you want a drink ? Bloody hell , how many of them are there ? - You okay ? - It 's getting a bit too much now . - I don 't know what you mean . - I said I 'd help you look for one lad . What about all those people in there , what , 40 , 50 ? Am I supposed to help all them , too ? Of course not . Just focus on Jonah . The rest aren 't part of this investigation . But they are . Of course they are . No , no they 're not . Find a pattern . Find out what happens , we might find Jonah . - What ? - Brilliant . You 're brilliant . I 've got to go . - Where you going ? - Cross-referencing ! Cross ... Cross-referencing ? You said we needed more data to be certain the rift takes people . List of all missing persons in Cardiff over the last 10 years . I 'll deal with the personal details and I 'm sending you dates , locations and approximate times they went missing . And you want me to check the dates they went missing against negative rift spikes ? Yes , I do , and I 'll dig out any CCTV footage . What about Jack ? Do we tell him what we 're doing ? When we 're sure . Tosh , if we can prove you were right , we can start looking for the people who 've been taken . Maybe even try and stop it from happening . Oh , my God . There are really this many ? Now we tell Jack . Cardiff has an epidemic of missing persons , totally out of kilter with any other comparable city . And it 's all down to the rift . IANTO : Are you sure they aren 't just normal missing persons ? People do go missing for other reasons . No , Toshiko crossed-referenced the locations with the rift spikes . The people we 've identified here are definitely the victims of the rift . What do we think happens to them ? Scattered through time and space , I guess . Cheery thought . Thank you . This is good work . But I don 't know what you want us to do . We find a way to prevent it . Toshiko , can we predict when the spikes are going to happen ? No . And they 're gone in a matter of seconds . - Then I don 't know how we combat them . - Jack , we have a duty here . These people are victims of the rift . - If they 'd been attacked by a Weevil ... - Weevil 's we can catch . If they 're victims , we fix their wounds . But this , we don 't know when it 's going to happen . We don 't know where they end up . Seriously , Gwen , practically , tell me what we should do . We help those left behind . Why not ? ( JACK SIGHING ) - It 's nothing to do with us . Move on . - Jack , you should see these people . - Some things we can 't fix . - So we don 't even try ? Look , Jack 's right . They need counselling , support . - That is not us . - Ah , okay , is that what you all think ? We are the only ones who know the truth . We can help them . We don 't have to be this hard . - It 's not a badge of honour , Jack . - Close this down . Jack ! I 'll talk to him . So , is that it , then ? We just sweep it under the carpet ? God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change . Oh , bollocks to serenity ! For a lovely girl , you 've got a very dirty mouth . - Yes . - I 'm with Jack . - We did our best . - Thanks , Tosh . So on the one hand , you 've got blokes like Mo , who swears it 's the best thing he 's done in his life . And then on the other , you 've got Big Dave , who says he feels like his life 's ended and how he 's a second class citizen in his own house . Although to be fair , he said his life had ended when Susy made him ditch the bike . Will you just stop wittering ? Thank you . God ! It 's not wittering . It 's talking . We 're supposed to be talking . I 've been trying to talk to you for a week , but for some reason you don 't want to . Oh , wake up , Rhys . What 's the point ? We don 't need a talk . It takes two seconds ' thought . How are we supposed to have kids with my job ? Torchwood does not do maternity leave . " Oh , I 'm sorry , Jack , " I 'd love to help out with the aliens but I can 't get a baby-sitter . " No , no , no , I 'll sort out that bomb " once I 've dropped Rhys Junior at nursery . " Stop dancing around it , it 's a dead question . You know , sometimes I fucking hate you ! I mean , look at you , caught up in your little group like nothing else matters . Like being a hero is an end in itself . Well , it 's not . You save this city . Well done . You save the world . Whatever . What for ? - Sorry ? - Why are you doing it ? What are you trying to protect ? What are you fighting for ? - Because if I don 't ... - Shut up , I 'm talking now , right ? You do it so people can live their lives . And there 's nothing more important than that . Falling in love , getting married , buying flats , having kids or not . But real life , that 's what you 're protecting . And if you 're starting to think that your shit is more important than real life , then we 're not going to last very long here , love . I 'm sorry . - There 's this thing at work ... - I don 't care ! I don 't care ! When you 're with me , we deal with us , right ? Our lives . You got a problem at work , you sort it at work . Jack ? Jack , I ... Oh , God ! ( AWKWARD LAUGH ) Ah , sorry . I 'm sorry . ( GWEN SNICKERS ) IANTO : Uh ... - Ianto , hi . I 'm sorry . I didn 't realise . - It doesn 't matter . And I wouldn 't have come in if I 'd known ... Always room for one more . We could have used you an hour ago for a naked hide-and-seek . He cheats . He always cheats . - Was there something you wanted ? - Jonah Bevan . The missing boy . I 'll make it my own special project . My responsibility . Nothing to do with anyone else . I 'm not letting it go . No . - What ? - I don 't know how I can be any clearer . Oh . Well , Tosh has her projects , so does Ianto . Why can 't I ? - Leave it alone . - I can 't . - Coming back in ? Work to do . - Yup . - Jack , we 're not finished . - Yes , we are . Uh ... There 's a package on your desk . ( MOBILE PHON E RINGING ) - Hello ? - You still working ? - Sort of . - Thought so . There 's a cup of tea here with your name on it . And you think this is going to help us with the Jonah Bevan case ? Andy , just leave it , will you ? This is hi-tech stuff . - Sorry , no . It 's GPS . - What ? Global Positioning System . About as hi-tech as my mobile phone . What you got here is a glorified map . Ooh , X marks the spot , eh ? X being the middle of the Bristol Channel . Oh , no , hang on . Sorry , no . Flat Holm Island . Who 's sending you out there , then ? That 's just deserted scrubland . Couldn 't get us a refill , could you ? While you bask in my technical brilliance ? ( MOBILE PHON E RINGING ) - Hello ? - You left me that package , didn 't you ? JACK : Ianto ? - I don 't know what you mean . - Ianto , what 's going on ? - N ight , Gwen . - JACK : Ianto ! Ianto , don 't you ... Right . So , first thing in the morning , we hire a boat . Now , I know a couple of boat skippers who owe me a favour . So we 'll head out to Flat Holm , poke around , see if we can sort this out . Or even better , you get me the boat and I 'll tell you what I find . No boat trip , no boat . I 'm part of this . - Okay . - Brilliant . - But you do as I say . - Yeah , of course , yeah . Listen . I was gonna ask ... Promise me you won 't laugh . Have you got any vacancies coming up ? You know , with Torchwood . 'Cause I was thinking , I 'm great to work with . You know , you could tip them the wink . Maybe , yeah . - WOMAN : What can I get you , lads ? - Two burgers and two teas , please . GWEN : Andy ! 50 quid . That 's a bit steep , isn 't it ? Offer him £ 35 . Gwen , I 'm not being funny . If you want to haggle , go to Morocco . ( SIGHING ) All right , 50 quid . Then open waves , here we come . - Get us a couple of teas before we go . - You 're kidding ? You 're not kidding ? I don 't know . Do this for me and I 'll give you 100 quid . Oi ! I 'm sorry , Andy ! Yeah , right ! I 'm sorry ! ( GWEN SIGHS ) ( ELECTRIC BUZZING ) ( BELL BUZZING ) WOMAN ON SPEAKER : All right ! Who are you ? Torchwood . Access code 4743 17432 . I 'm with Jack Harkness . He 's supposed to warn us about visitors . Law unto himself , isn 't he ? ( DOOR OPENING ) And he knows we 'll always forgive him . ( MAN SCREAMING ) ONTV : ... those that stand out can become immediate targets ... This your first time ? We all find it difficult at first . Are you looking for anyone in particular ? Yes . - How many people are down here ? - Didn 't he tell you ? ( MAN SOBBING ) What 's that ? - Is he okay ? - We do our best to help him . Caroline . Sorry , but why are they ... Are you all right ? Oh , my God ! They 're here . What are you doing to them ? What 's going on here ? Tell me ! I 'll take it from here , Helen . - It was Ianto , wasn 't it ? - What are you doing ? - I can explain . - No , no , no , no . You stay away from me ! Gwen , let 's go outside and talk . These are the people taken by the rift . What are they doing here ? - What have you done ? - Gwen , listen to me . He 's here . - He 's been here all along . - It 's not that simple . - Open it . - Gwen , before I ... Now ! ( DOOR U N LOCKS ) Hello ? Jonah ? ( MAN GRU NTING ) I 'm looking for Jonah . Why ? Am I in the right room ? ( MAN BREATHING H EAVILY ) Yes . I 'm Jonah . I 'm sorry , I must be in the wrong room . The Jonah Bevan I 'm looking for is 15 years old and he went missing from the barrage . That was me . - Who are you ? - My name is Gwen Cooper , and I 'm with Torchwood . What ... What 's happened to you ? I was walking home . There was a light . I woke up and the land was on fire . There were flames for miles on end . A man pulled me from the flames . Took me to a building where they tried to work on the burns . I thought I was going to die . I don 't remember when the ground started shaking . And then I realised it wasn 't a building after all . It was a rescue craft . The last off a burning planet . We watched the solar system burn . It was so beautiful . I am so sorry for what 's happened to you . Can I trust you to tell the truth ? Of course . Am I really home ? Yes , you 're home . Thank you . Jonah , I 've come because your mother is still looking for you . - She 's still alive ? - You 've only been gone for seven months . - She never stopped looking . - I tried so hard to come home . I was lost so long . You 're safe now . You are safe . Can I see her ? Can you bring her here ? Is that what you want ? When I took over Torchwood , there were two just like Jonah . Ravaged from falling through the rift . Being kept in the vaults , neglected . I wanted them looked after . I set this place up . Told the staff these were experiments that had gone wrong . - How many are there ? - Seventeen last count . ( GWEN EXHALES ) It 's increased over the last year . Like the rift is trying to correct its mistakes . But not all the missing return ? - No . - You can 't keep them hidden . They have families who deserve to know . Gwen , they 're sick . In ways you could never imagine . We can 't fix them . We just care for them . Jonah 's asked me to bring N ikki here . - No . - She has a right to know . - No way . - She said not knowing is the worst part . How are you going to tell her her child has aged 40 years in the last seven months ? That he 's scarred , that he cannot look after ... We don 't have the right to hide it from her . If you tell her , you have to tell her about the rift and Torchwood . - Then I will . - What if she doesn 't believe you ? I have to try . We owe her the truth . Jack , if you 'd lost someone , wouldn 't you want to know ? Let me try . Please . We got another meeting on Tuesday . Will you come to that , or ... You 're not here for small talk . I 've found Jonah . - Is he dead ? - No . Is he hurt ? - We 're looking after him . - Where ? Can I see him ? Yes . Sorry . N ikki , there are things I have to tell you first . And all I 'm asking is you trust me . ( MOBILE PHON E RINGING ) GWEN : Andy , I know you hate me right now . - I 'm hanging up . - No , no , no . Please don 't . It 's about N ikki . I found Jonah . - Where ? - I can 't tell you that . Oh , here we go again . Piss off , why don 't you ? I 've got N ikki with me . I 've told her about Torchwood and about what we do . I need you to confirm to her that I 'm not mad or dangerous or a liar . - You used me , Gwen . - Sorry . That 's how you see me , isn 't it ? Occasionally useful . Worth stringing along in case I can ever help you . Andy . You 'd never recommend for me to join Torchwood , would you ? No . Thank you . I want to take N ikki to see Jonah . But you 've got to tell her that she can trust me . We can fix this , Andy . We can make it right . ( SIGHING ) Put her on . N ikki . Andy . Okay . Where is he ? Remember what I said , you 're not going to recognise him at first . - I know . - He 's aged . He 's been injured ... I just want to see him . You understand what I 've told you now , N ikki ? - He 's not a child any more ... - It doesn 't matter . I have to see him . Let me see him . Okay . Hello ? Jonah ? Yes ? I can 't see you . Jonah ? - Mum . - No . - No . - It 's okay , Mum . It 's me . It 's okay . - Stay away ! - Shh . I 'm sorry . I 'm really , really sorry . - What are you doing ? - Shh . - What have you done to me ? - N ikki , I promise . This is Jonah . That is not my son ! Get me out . - I want to get out of here . - Will you listen , please ? This is him . - You are sick . All of you ! - Listen to me ... Did you fix my wardrobe door ? We bought it flat-pack , made it together . Bottom left hinge keeps coming loose . - You said you 'd sort it . - No . Every evening you 'd buy a bottle of beer . You let me sneak one sip , just the one . Don 't want to get a habit for it . You got two alarms ' cause you always sleep through the first . Make him stop . You talk about the day when you can earn decent money and afford yourself some decent make-up . - I 'm not hearing this . - You won 't buy me a double bed because you don 't understand what I need it for . - Shut up ! - And when I ask you why you haven 't got married , you say you 'll never be lonely because I 've always got you . ( SOBBING ) It 's me , Mum ! It 's me ! Jonah ? I 've been so lost . I walked for years trying to get home . - I 'm sorry . - Why ? That night . I was late . I 'm sorry . ( NIKKI SOBBING ) Ah , the sights I 've seen , Mum . It 's fine . - It 'll take time . - It 'll be okay . You have to leave Jonah now . - What ? - Helen ... It 's for your own benefit . No . I 'm taking him home now . N ikki , stop for a second . You can 't just take him out of here . I know how to look after my child . I 'll tell them he 's my father . - I can take care of him . - We can 't allow that . He 's my son ! I say what 's allowed ! - Jonah ? - It 's started again . - What 's happening ? - H ELEN : He 's starting the downswing . What 's a downswing ? What is it ? Jonah ! You 've seen him in the good phase . It gets briefer every day . - It really might be best if you leave . - ( GRU NTING ) Helen ... Oh , it 's all right , sweetheart . I 'm here . - Make it stop . - I wish I could . Please , it would be better if you didn 't stay . - I 'm not leaving . I 'm not leaving him . - Okay , okay . - Then you should move away . - Why ? Will you tell me why ? ( NIKKI SCREAMING ) ( GWEN GROANS ) GWEN : I 'd never heard a sound like it . This primal howl . The scream lasts 20 hours every day . Before the rift returned him , Jonah had looked into the heart of a dark star . What he 'd seen had driven him mad . They say you can visit . Whenever you like . When he 's in a good phase . Promise me you won 't do this to anyone else . Before , I had the memory . Whenever I thought of him , I 'd see him laughing with his mates , playing football , scoffing his breakfast . And now I just hear that ... That terrible noise . I thought you wanted to know what happened to him . I did . I was wrong . It was better when I didn 't know . Before you , I had hope . ( SIGHING ) Apology , is it ? Tonight we talk about what you want . Kids , the future , anything you want . You all right ? Hey , come here . ( GWEN CRYING ) I 'm sorry . You wanna sit down ? Okay ? Okay . Now then . You tell me everything , from the beginning . There 's this woman , N ikki . She had a son , Jonah . He went missing seven months ago ... JACK : Some people believe that in the moments before your death , your life flashes before your eyes . IANTO : Explosive devices . Snap !

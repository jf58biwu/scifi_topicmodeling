No problem , though you might save that apology to Mr. White , because he and his lawyer been waiting for almost an hour . His wife dead last week in a car accident but Penny has been able to encode her memories from the original brain tissue , so at least we 're not working with blank slate - Did he request of any enhancements ? - He took a few years of , I think . - They ussualy do . - She was only 30 ! Well 30 is new 40 , didn 't you get the memo ? Surprised he didn 't order double Ds .

I love saying it . - What will it you remember ? - Not sure . I was able to acquire about 40 percent from the source tissue . I might got more , but it seem to be in a rush to bury her . You had a funeral ? - Of course , why wouldn 't I ? - It was a lovely creamation ceremony . - But will everyone know this isn 't really .. - My client intends to begin a new live in seclution . Want to see her ? It looks so real . She is . Cloning is 100 % genetic match to the original . It will take a few more days for the neural paths to be written , but .. Once she awakes downloaded memories will seem completely real to her . For all intents and purposes this is your wife . Stephanie . - It won 't be awake for a while so why not ... - Stop to call her " it " . That 's funny . Most men become protective of their wives before they killed them . It was an accident .

We went to college together , didn 't really hang out much but I wound up marrying one of his friend . I heard that bit the dust . Bummer . - How did you hear ... - Colin tells everyone he gave you the job and saved you from divorce depression . - And something about the chocolate ice cream . - Wonderful . So ... Doing some covert stuff , huh ? Cool . Want some ? Are you really a scientist ? Graduated from Stanford at 16 . Haven 't you heard ? Geek is taking over the world . So . What so interesting about Whites ' case that got you hide in the frankestein lab ? Doesn 't it seem strange that a guy who so desperate to bring his wife back - to life is sleeping with his lawyer ? - Ah , you tipical not to huh ? What can I tell you , people do stupic chick . You saw the body when you do the download , did it look like she was in a car accident ? Wel , no way to be sure , but there was several broken bones and a head fracture so it 's consistent . I get it , your husband slept around so you transfer it to this guy . You got your pyhsc degree in 17 ? At 19 . I was trying to figure out boys . I should have just read playboy . Just because he 's banging his lawyer doesn 't mean he doesn 't love his wife . Who has a funeral for someone they 're gonna bring back a week later ? I know what you mean . Trust me , a couple of minutes with this program and you 'll forget all about your ex and White case . Sounds like I 'm not the only one who was bark by a guy . Who says it was a guy ? Just in case , think of it as ... a vibrator for your mind . First week in a new city , I figured you might need this . - Rocky road- - - Just what I need . I got water and I got wine . No thanks , I 'm fine . Wow , I see the place are really coming together . Sorry . It 's okay . It was already broken . I remember you two were inseperable in college . Let me ask you what happened . Nothing dramatic , just died quitely . Did you talk to him ? Since the divorce I mean . Won 't even know what to say . One minute we 're best friends , the next we 're total stranger . Cliche ' , I know . Look on the bright side . You have no where to go but up . I just came to check in on you . - See you tommorow . - Bright and early . What the hell ... Wow , that 's foreplay ! How are you feeling ? Better ... - Where .. ? - Home . The doctor said you may experience some memory loss . You were at car accident at Mulholland . You lucky to be alive . Car ? I don 't ... What can you remember ? Bits and pieces ... Jumbled . - On the stairs , there was a woman . - That 's our lawyer , Monica . She 's been staying with us for a while , helping to keep the White enterpises going without you . White Enterprises ? - I 'm sorry ... - We build it together . Producing microchips . Actually , I just market the stuff . You 're the real brain center . Not anymore . Like this one . It was your baby . Give it time . Don 't worry about work right now , it doesn 't matter . WE have all the time in the world . What 's wrong ? Nothing , just ... tired ... I thought I have lost you . She has been playing the same song for a week now I swear if she doesn 't change the tune soon I 'm going to find out just how many days she has left . Stephanie is just trying to work through her memories and ... Besides I like it . Of course you do . But while you 're tending on that clone , I have been running the company . A company , I might remind you ... That worthless without that password . - I don 't want to rush it . - Try ! - Working kind of late . - What ? Ah , yeah ... hi . Just trying to look at something before I head home . Hey , you know anything about this ? Your life on a chip . Boy , you don 't quit , do you ? What 's this life memory chip ? Supposed to work like normal memory recorder , but instead of downloading every thought and feeling you 're having at that moment ... It takes a photocopy of your brain . It downloads everything . Every thought , every memory you ever had ... Wicked , huh ? And Mrs. White created it ? Who knows , she was working on it for years . I heard she put the company deep in the rent just to finance it . But she succeded ... Ka-ching ! All well . So what if someone own the company now that Mrs. White is dead . I guess if you had the chip you 'd be a billioner . And if they didn 't ? Or they did but they didn 't know how to work it ? Then my old photocopy will be worth more than the company stock . Were we happy ? I don 't mean years ago , but ... before the accident . We ... We had our share of problems . And now ? There 's so much I can 't remember ... I don 't know what I did . Or what you did , but ... I got to give it another chance . Like the memories I still have . First your wife , then me , then that thing up stairs ... you bring a whole new meaning of " pussy men " It 's not like that , I can 't ... I think we would be happy this time . Stop trying to think . You 're crazy ! Put that away . Oh , don 't look so worry , I need yu alive , and well , and stupid , just as always . If you 're gonna get that code , then I will . I can handle her . Yeah , you 've been doing a bang up job so far . Data Ready . Download commencing . Stephanie ! Stephanie ! Stephanie ! Stephanie , can you hear me ? Stephanie ! Stephanie , can you hear me ? She did it ! The chip 's been activated ! Get away from me ! - What 's happening ? - It 's alright ... No ! No , I remember ! - You were trying to steal my company ! - Our company . I was going to divorce you ! - You ... - What 's the matter ? Don 't remember the rest ? Want the clip notes . You encrypted the prototipe chip . - And Michael killed you . - What ? No , it wasn 't like that , it was an accident , we were arguing ... and I grab your arm , and you fell . - Down stairs ... - And died . The car accident was my idea . - What are you talking about ? - Shut up , Monica ! The music . The keys ... You encrypted the chip with the numbers in the song . I knew that there 's something about that chip . You 're too obvious , asking me about it the minute I woke up . Took me a while for me to remember the code ... Now I know everything . You 're not getting my company . I built it , it 's mine ! No , it was Stephanie White 's company . And she died a month ago . They did an autopsy . There 's even a funeral , I hear it was quite touching . How ? Your body ... Your memories ... They 're copy from someone else . You 're nothing really . Not even human . You 're just a clone . No ! Going somewhere ? You need me . Without Michael you don 't have any control over the compnay . Now that it 's not encrypted , I 'll just sell the chip . It 's called pre-entreprise . Miss Montrose . You 're like a stray that keep coming back for a saucer of milk . Michael ... I love you ... forever . It 's just ... I 'm sorry . Don 't forget ... how happy ... we were ... before . Yes . Colin , this is ... Julia , Julia White . I see , nice to meet you , Julia . She 's looking to start over . Something I can relate to , so I thought ... I had alot of experience ... sort of . In return I have a new chip you might be interested in . Is that ... I 've heard of this . If it 's works ... I 'm sure I can find an opening . How is this can capture a person memory ? - Well , here what I did ... - What kind of microprocessor did you use ... Your first assignment was eventfull . Sure you want to stay here ? This incident must have played into your your concerns . People are rare to get a second chance in life . maybe this is it . For both of us .

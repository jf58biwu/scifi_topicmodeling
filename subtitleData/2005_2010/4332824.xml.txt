 Over the last 60 years 4400 people have been abducted All at once they were returned . With no memory of where they 've been They haven 't aged a day And some have returned with new abilities All are trying to reconnect with a life interrupted We 're not a threat . We 're salvation . The world will have to deal with us . Previously on the 4400 ... The canadian border 's about 30 miles away . I 'd cross as soon as you can . Ryland will be looking . I didn 't want us to end , Thomas . Ever . I 'll find a way to bring you back , i promise . - April ! - Surprised ? How 's it going , sibling ? Jordan , you just told me there 's a little girl out there who can see the future , and she saw you dead . Do i stay away from the center ? I cut myself off ? Even if you confess , Kyle , you 're still going to jail . You try to bury stuff like this , it changes you . We have to get married . It 's the only way we can be sure we 'll never lose each other . Shawn ! Shawn Farrell ! Do you know ... who i am ? - Get out of the way ! - Jordan ! Jordan ! Jordan ! Jordan ! Did you see Jordan Collier come through here ? No , sir . Long hair , beard . Anyone ? You saw him , right ? Look , i want this place secure . No one gets in or out until i say different . Come on . Guys , we 've been all over the grounds , and we can 't find anybody . Are you sure it was Collier ? It was him . He looked right at me . He talked to me . It did look like him , but i only saw him for a second . Well , if he 's on foot , he can 't have got far . I think we should call NTAC , get them to sweep the neighborhood . Shawn . What 's going on ? The ceremony was supposed to start 20 minutes ago . Richard , i just saw Jordan . He 's alive . He 's here . What ? Where ? Look , Shawn , me and Diana have to get moving . Hey , no , no , no , no . I 'm coming with you . What ? I 'm going to help you find him . Jordan looks different now . I 'm the one who got the best view of him . Shawn , you 're in the middle of your wedding . We 've got a thousand guests here ... the media ... Isabelle . You 're going to have to do some damage control . Tell Isabelle that the wedding 's not off ... It 's just postponed ... and i 'll come see her as soon as i can . I 'm sorry . Are we ready to go ? Daddy , what is it ? I thought we agreed . I don 't want to see you . This couldn 't wait , Kyle . He 's alive . Jordan Collier is alive . I 'm going to find him , Kyle , and i 'm going to get you out of here . It 's okay , sweetie . It 's going to be okay . I just feel so bad for you . I 'll be fine . You don 't need to worry about me . Shawn . Thank god . What happened ? All the guests are gone . Everybody thinks you walked out . Ah , it 's ... it 's okay . I just ... i need to talk to Isabelle for a second ... if you don 't mind . So , your " daddy " came home , huh ? Your dad told you about Jordan ? He did . I was really curious as to why i wasn 't getting married . I 'm sorry , Isabelle . I am . Jordan 's out there somewhere . I need to find him . And then what ? If he 's alive , what does that mean for you and me ? I 'm not sure . Jordan was dead , and now he 's not ... Shawn , is the wedding off ... or isn 't it ? It 's still going to happen . Just not today , and not until i figure out what 's going on with Jordan . I know Collier means a lot to you . To everyone here . Find him . Di ... April , my god , what are you doing here ? I came to see my sister . Tell me , do you have some kind of allergy that keeps you from calling ahead ? I wasn 't sure that was a good idea . If i called , you might have refused to see me . So , are you going to hug your only sister , or are you going to shut the door in my face ? I 'm sorry . I just ... you surprised me , that 's all . I mean , i didn 't even know you were in Seattle . I 'm moving here . Why ? Are you in trouble ? No ! I 'm in love . I know what you 're thinking ... " same difference " ... but not this time . This guy 's the keeper . Oh , that 's ... that 's great . I 'm really happy for you . Well , wait till you meet him , which should be any minute now . He 's parking the car . April , i 'm in the middle of something for work . It won 't take long . Just a couple of minutes . Please ? It 'd mean a lot . I bet you Maia would be happy , too . Aunt April ! Someone 's getting tall . Look at you . You 're like a supermodel . I bet the boys think so , too . Maia , this is my friend Ben . I heard a lot about you , young lady . Your aunt says you 're a very special girl . Maybe a little . Sorry , i 'm in a bit of a rush . I actually told April we should have called ahead . See ? Polite . And if you did a body search , you wouldn 't find a piercing anywhere . April mentioned that you 're a photographer . Uh , yeah . April and i just got back from India . I was doing a piece on the caste system there . It 's all for a show he 's putting on at the museum of contemporary art . Really ? Wow . - Well ... - Yeah . I spent some time in India when i was a graduate student . We were doing an epidemiology study in the Nîlgîri range . We were there . Well , you are so lucky . It was so beautiful . I used to wake up early so i could watch the sun come up over the foothills . Yeah , i 've got some shots of the sunrises , just for my own personal collection . If i 'd known you were interested , i 'd have brought them by . I 'd like to see them . I 'll bring them by . I look forward to it , but right now , i really got to rush . Nice to meet you . You too . - Bye . - Bye . You 're right . He is a keeper . This is a nice place . Collier sure had an eye for real estate . I mean , what , this is the sixth place we 've looked at today ? Must be nice to have that kind of money . Diana ... look at this . Someone 's been staying here . Guys . It 's from a soup kitchen downtown . What does the notebook say ? The whole thing 's full . " The city is a thousand miles wide . " " The last city . " " The walls are a hundred feet high . " " Nothing grows on the outside anymore , so the people beg to be let in , but nobody listens . " It 's all like this . Is that Collier 's handwriting ? This is just preliminary , but i ran the handwriting from the notebook against the sample from Collier 's that you gave me . Now , they don 't look alike at all . I mean , the handwriting from the notebook is shaky , almost like whoever did it is sick , but the software says that they 're a probable match . So Jordan wrote this stuff ? I can 't say for sure , but there 's a lab in D. C. that 'll be able to give us a positive identification . But it 's probable , right ? Jordan 's alive . Well , we don 't know that yet . I 'll tell you one thing ... if he did write this , he has seen some interesting stuff while he 's been gone . The whole thing goes on and on about a walled city . You know , a privileged elite lives on the inside . Everything else is just a wasteland . Oh , and then the last few pages are just one phrase repeated over and over again . " The war for the future will be fought in the past . " Mommy ? You scared me . Sorry . I couldn 't sleep . Oh , well ... Why don 't you come on in . I 'll make you a bowl of ice cream . Our family 's going to get bigger now . Oh , sweetie ... Don 't get too attached to the idea of your aunt April living in Seattle . You know how she can be . That 's not it . You 're going to get married . I saw it . Not too long from now . You look the same when it happens . I 'm getting married ? Isn 't it great ? You 're going to be so happy . Okay , well , um ... Did you happen to see who the lucky guy was ? Yeah . It was the man we just met . Ben . Maia ... You saw me getting married to my sister 's boyfriend ? Mm-hmm . But Ben is with aunt April . I guess they don 't stay together , 'cause you two are going to get married . You 're going to have a husband . I 'm going to have a dad . Isn 't that the best ? Hello ? Oh , hey , Tom . No ... we 're up . Have you seen this man ? Sure . I volunteer at St. Alban 's kitchen . These guys brought the sketch by when we were closing up tonight . We bring food down here twice a week . I 've seen him . You sure about that ? Positive . I remember him because everyone else always lets him go to the front of the line . They get out of his way . I 've never seen that before . But you haven 't seen him today . Not for a couple of weeks , but I always see him eating with Will . Will 's kind of the elder statesman around here . He knows just about everyone . Yeah , I know him . We all do . The preacher . " The preacher " ? He never said his real name was Jordan Collier . I thought Collier was dead . Who are you guys , anyway ? We 're from NTAC . We need to find this man . When 's the last time you saw him ? - Just now . - He 's here ? He 's always here . It 's pretty empty . You 're sure he 's back here ? He never goes anywhere . Okay ... say hello .. to the preacher . You made a painting of him ? Not me personally , but the preacher 's a popular guy . He 's got some amazing stories . The guy claims to have seen the future . People around here ... we believe him . You lied to me , Isabelle . I don 't remember much about being a baby . You and mom , mostly . Vague stuff . I remember Collier . I remember how he made you guys feel , and I remember how I felt when he touched mom that time . You gave him something to remember that day . Collier was recovering for months . That 's not the only thing I did to him . Right before he died , he came to talk to me . I know it sounds weird ... I was just a baby ... but he wanted me to tell him whether it was safe to go ahead with the party he was planning . I remember . That 's when he asked to take you for a walk through the gardens . He wanted ... power . He wanted acclaim , a name that would live on after he died , so that 's what I showed him . So , what , you gave him a vision ? He had the party . He got shot . I didn 't pull the trigger , but daddy , I made that happen . If Collier 's back , he knows what I did . What does he want ? Revenge ? We don 't even know whether or not he is alive . What if he tells Shawn what I did ? You sound like you 're scared of Collier . Isabelle ... Collier 's a very powerful man ... but he is just a man . He was just a man . We don 't know what he is now . Guys , i 've got something you need to check out . You know that graffiti mural , the one that might be Collier ? Well , there 's a national graffiti database . I ran the portrait against it . And ? This preacher guy ? He gets around . That one 's from St. Louis . That 's El Paso . Tempe , Arizona , Reno ... these are from all over the country . If this is Collier , he 's been a very busy man . He might need a shave and a haircut , but he 's still got charisma . He 's got followers everywhere . So , what , he 's traveling around , preaching the gospel of the future ? Are you almost done ? I was going to make you a snack . - Five more minutes . - Okay . Did you see Ben today ? You mean your aunt April 's boyfriend ? No , I didn 't see him , and i 'm not going to see him . Your antenna is not working right on this one , sweetie . Okay . Hi . Um ... look , i 'm not the type of guy who drops by unannounced all the time , i promise ... Okay . But I was just in the neighborhood . I didn 't have your phone number . The pictures we talked about ? Oh . Thanks . Um , come in . - Hi , Maia . - Hi , Ben . I 'm going to go to my room to study . You two talk . Um , so , you going to open it ? Does it look familiar ? That 's the nilgiri hills . Yeah . Listen ... this is not going to happen . Excuse me ? Married ? Are you sure she meant me ? Uh-huh . Well , that can 't happen . I 'm glad you agree . April told me about Maia and what she can do , but she 's wrong here , right ? Oh , she 's going to be . Okay , um ... i 'm going to go ... and no more visits to bring you pictures . No more visits , period . Okay , well ... it was nice meeting you ... and then resolving never to see you again . Yeah , nice to meet you , too . Did you kill me ? That 's him . That 's him ! That 's Jordan Collier ! That 's Jordan Collier ! Tell them I didn 't kill you ! Tell them you 're Jordan Collier ! Tell them ! Tell them you 're Jordan Collier ! Tell them ! is that who I am ? When you went to see Kyle , you signed in as Jeffrey Paulson . Why ? I found a library card in the pocket of my coat , and that 's what it said . I thought ... i thought maybe that was my name . Your name is Jordan Collier . You don 't remember that ? You 're one of the 4400 . Am I ? You were shot . You died . Ah ... yes , I saw that in the papers . I thought I looked like that man . You disappeared . Do you have any idea where you 've been ? Everywhere . I have been everywhere . I 've been alive for hundreds of years , maybe thousands . I couldn 't speak to anyone . I just ... I wandered . No food , no sleep ... and I watched it all . I watched the world ... change ... and it just kept getting worse ... and the skies filled with smoke ... and all the machines stopped working , and the streets , and the rivers ... were filled with bodies . The dead ... were everywhere . The earth ... cried out ... and it ... it never stopped . The things you 're talking about , they haven 't happened . Not yet , anyway . It 's 2006 . It 's been less than a year since you were shot . How could it be ? I 've been wandering for so long . That 's the preliminary DNA report . That man we 're holding is Jordan Collier . Well , at least somebody 's sure of it . I need Collier to remember who he is so he can stand in front of a judge and ask for my son to be freed . But Tom , this is already a win for Kyle . Collier 's alive . So he serves a term for attempted murder instead of murder ? No , no , no , Diana . That 's not good enough . Look , Collier knows who he is . It 's buried in there somewhere . He showed up at the wedding . He found his way to one of his safe houses . We just need to find a way to help bring it all to the surface . Tom , I just got off the phone with the National Security Advisor . He wants to schedule a conference call with him , me , and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to discuss the fact that Jordan Collier is somehow back from the dead , and you want me to look the other way while Alana Mareva , a fugitive , walks into NTAC and uses her ability on Collier ? She can access his memories . Show him his life . These people in D. C. , they need Collier to remember who he is , too , right ? They need answers . This might be the only way to get them . Nina , please ... Come on . We 're talking about my son . You have a way to get in touch with Alana ? Make the call . I got it , Maia . You just couldn 't stand to see me happy , could you ? April , what are you talking about ? What did you say to Ben ? Huh ? What did you say , Diana ? Nothing . Why ? He broke up with me ! You weren 't supposed to break up with her . That 's not why I told you what Maia said . I realize that , but you have to understand , a precog just told me that I was with the wrong person , and if you know you 're with the wrong person ... why stay with them ? I don 't know . Maybe because you love them . I do love April . At least , I thought I did . You know , I can 't believe how casual you can be with all this . Maybe it 's because you live with a 4400 . But someone just told me that I met the person , the woman , that i 'm supposed to be with . I can 't ignore it . You know , I want you to tell me the truth . When you look at me , do you feel anything at all ? An attraction ? An inkling of an attraction ? Yes . I do . You asked for the truth , so , yes , I do , and if I met you under different circumstances , i 'd ... i 'd want to see you again . Yeah . Me too . But it doesn 't matter . We can 't do it . Yeah , i know . I 'm going to take my sister 's stuff and go . But wouldn 't it be something if we were giving up our shot at happiness ? Hello , thomas . You cut your hair . I can 't believe you 're here . Thank you for doing this . For kyle , i 'd do anything . You know that . Besides , i missed you . You ready ? You don 't have to do anything . Just shut your eyes and relax . You won 't feel anything . I promise . My name 's jordan Collier . If i could stay here for a while ... you 're one of the 4400 . That baby could be the key to the future . Peter has all the time in the world . Hi , peter . My name is jordan Collier . Hello , richard . Welcome to the revolution . Collier , are you all right ? My name is jordan Collier . I know why they sent us back . I saw the catastrophe , and i know what we have to do to stop it . You say you have all these answers . Tell us what they are , and then we can talk about letting you out of here . You 'll learn what i know when everyone else does . When will that be ? As soon as i am free , you and the world will know what i know . And what if we hold you indefinitely ? I 've grown accustomed to waiting . Yeah , well , i can 't . My son is in prison . You 're the only one who can get him out . Then you want me released as badly as i do . Your son kyle is innocent . He is a pawn , and i will say that to whomever you want ... the moment i am a free man . I can 't believe this , nina . My son could be one court appearance away from freedom , and you 're refusing to let Collier testify on his behalf ? I 'm not refusing . The pentagon is . Their official position is , Collier 's not even back . Come on , nina . They can 't honestly believe that they can squash this . Well , they 're going to try . Look , Collier 's return changes everything . We 're not just talking about galvanizing the 4400 . There are religious groups all over the world who would consider him the messiah . No matter what he says , no matter how crazy it is , people are going to listen . So maybe we should find out what 's on his mind before we stick him in front of a bank of microphones . And what if we don 't like what he has to say ? We stick him in the basement , pretend this never happened ? I don 't think that 's going to be our decision . I 'd be surprised if Collier 's not transferred out of here by this time tomorrow . They should be here by now . You sure you 're okay ? L - i will be . When i touched Collier , those things i saw ... they weren 't only from his past . There were other images , too . Terrible ones . It was like a nightmare . I don 't know how Collier lived through it and stayed sane . I don 't want to leave you , thomas . I don 't want to go on the run again . You know , maybe you don 't have to . What you did today , it helped ntac . If i tell them they can have access to your ability , maybe they 'll drop the charges against you . I 'd never hurt the 4400 ... i know . I know . Maybe we can work it so you don 't have to . Okay ? Uncle tommy . Wait right here . What the hell 's going on ? I didn 't help you find jordan so you could lock him away . Shawn , they 're scared . This is how the government reacts when it 's scared . You know , if we wanted , we could take him . If we set our minds to it , we can get into ntac , and there won 't be anything you can do to stop us . You may be right ... but there might be another way . Here . That 's a still from a security camera at ntac . It was taken this afternoon . You show it to everyone . You let the world know that Collier 's back . Thank you . Yeah . wagon wheel . You know , i used to live on those things in college . Ben ... what are you doing here ? Well , i eat , too . So ... what do you think ? Coincidence ? Or is this thing going to happen whether we try to stop it or not ? Well , normally , i 'd give you a lecture about free will right now , but i have to admit , it might sound a little hollow . Well , we 're both here . We 're both shopping . Want to join forces ? i loved doing the final project . Let me guess ... faces of the elderly . Red lights . Every time i stopped at a red light , i 'd take a picture . Mm-hmm . You had to study these intersections that you never really noticed . Like , the stores , the people , the garbage cans ... Everything . That 's very creative . I was just screwing around . No , i would like to see them . Okay , yeah , i think i 've got them somewhere . No ... wait . What ? We can 't do this . We just did . That was a date , and that was a pretty good one . No , it wasn 't . It was nice , but it wasn 't a date . Then why do i feel like doing this ? You got to admit , that was nice , too . Can i see you again ? - Free Collier now ! - Free Collier now ! Anyone else feel like it 's bastille day ? Well , it does feel like the start of something . We have got to let him go . It 's either that or bring in troops . And we won 't just be reading the riot act to 4400s . There 's clergy out there . Citizens . Look , we can 't just sit on this . If Collier is some kind of messiah , he needs to be free . If he 's not , letting him out is still the right move . It would give him enough rope to hang himself . I 'll call d. c . , but they 're going to want to know how those people got their hands on a picture of Collier . Any idea what i should tell them ? Yeah , tell them it 's hard to cover up a resurrection . It 's you . Welcome back , jordan . Thank you for keeping the center alive while i was gone . Richard ... i 'm glad to see you still with us . You 'll have an important role to play . I stand here ... and i see the future . 4400s and non-4400s working hand in hand toward a common goal . Saving humanity is no longer the exclusive province of the 4400 . Each and every one of you will have work to do ... and the work starts now . We 're going to the courthouse . There is an innocent man who needs to be freed . Look , just get those people away from this building . You 're impeding the business of my court . They won 't leave until you listen to what i have to say . I hereby withdraw any and all charges against kyle baldwin for my alleged murder . Well , mr . Baldwin still assaulted two federal agents . Now , he fired a high-powered weapon into a crowd of people , and he admitted it all in a detailed confession . My son has been in jail for months . He 's a first-time offender . You could release him with time served . Those people out there , they listen to me . They will be back every day until this man 's son goes free . Well , these are highly unusual circumstances . I 'll grant you both that . Perhaps we can revisit the murder plea . Do . Quickly . Thank you . I thought you didn 't want to see me . Oh , i don 't . I want to see your pictures . Oh . Well , okay , so i knew you 'd be here . Well , then why 'd you come ? I guess i 've been thinking about the grocery store , and ... i thought it was a good date , too . It just didn 't end right . Okay ... and how should it have ended ? Hey , mommy . Hi . Where you been , di ? Nowhere . I just ... had to work late . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Don 't apologize . Those things you saw in me ... pride , ambition , vanity ... they were there . I had to die to lose them . I 've done bad things ... and i 'm supposed to do more . I know . And i 'm trying not to . Tell me what to do . I 'll do anything . Leave . Leave the 4400 center , and never come back . Nothing you can do will change what you are , isabelle . You are the enemy of the 4400 , the enemy of everything that is good , and that part of you that is human ... it is much smaller than the part of you that 's not , and your struggle to keep it alive will fail . No . No . I have a choice . Others might . Not you . If that 's true , if we 're enemies , then why shouldn 't i just kill you right now ? You 're welcome to try , but it won 't work . I 'm ready for you this time . This place is mine again ... and you 're not welcome here . Goodbye , isabelle . Next week , there 's only two episode of the 4400 left . And there 's still one war to fight . Every 4400 has a potential ennemy , If you don 't do it people will die This is a war , beetwen good and evil . A all new episode of the 4400 next sunday at 9

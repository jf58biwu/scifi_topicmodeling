'Cause if you 're gonna try and kill me again , I wouldn 't mind a head start . If I was going to try to kill you again , we wouldn 't be having this conversation . Fair enough . Listen , I 'm gonna go get some stuff from Radio World . I 'll meet you in a half hour . 30 minutes , I swear . Get me some of those cheese things , all right ? The crunchy ones , not the puffy ones . I 'm sorry to bother you . It 's just ... I 'm having these weird pains . What kind of pains ? Just like a spicy taco kind of pain , but I haven 't eaten any spicy tacos . And I 'm bleeding ! We need to take you to the hospital . Thanks . Miss ? Are you all right ? Someone get the manager . You been drinkin ' ? Taking drugs ? You got a wallet or some kind of ID on you ? What 's your name ? My name ? Why should I tell you ? If you don 't , we 'll give you one . Go ahead . I 'm dying to hear it . Alison ! Alison Young ! So , what are you in for ? I was in a store ... and I couldn 't remember anything . Blackouts . Been there , done that . - Can tattoos disappear ? - Sure . Got two of my ex 's lasered off . Ryan was ... right here . And Jose ... was here . - Next time I 'm thinking henna . - Henna ? - I 'm Jody . - I 'm ... Placenta 's still attached . There 's no previa . No evidence of major abruption . So everything 's fine . I wanna run a Kleihauer-Betke to rule out fetal blood cells . What does that mean ? We wanna make sure the blood is yours and not the baby 's . What if it is the baby 's ? Then we do an emergency C-section . But let 's not get ahead of ourselves . That didn 't sound good . No , it didn 't . Hey , look , I know you 're busy , so ... if you need to go ... - Can I call someone ? - You mean like the father ? I 'll be fine . Go . What happened here ? Some girl totally wigged out . What do you mean , wigged out ? She 's on drugs or something . She couldn 't even remember her own name . What 'd she look like ? Wanna guess like 16 , 17 , - brown hair , maybe like 5 ' 8 " ... - Where is she now ? Cops took her . Store owner 's not pressing charges . I don 't wanna see you back here . And you ... I 'm sick of you . This is your last get out of jail free . - Where you headed ? - I don 't know . - Good . - Why good ? 'Cause you 're comin ' with me . I 'm looking for my sister . She was picked up at the food mart on Van Nuys . Yeah , that one . We released her about an hour ago . Did she say where she was going ? I 'm sorry , but I really need to find her , okay ? She 's on medication . My mom 's gonna kill me . She might kill her , actually . She left with one of the street kids , Jody . Do you know where Jody hangs out ? Usually gets popped along the boulevard . All right , thanks . It 's a boy , you know . Boy 's good . I hate being trapped in bed ... feeling like there 's nothing I can do . If you can 't protect them when they 're still inside you , how can you ever protect them ? What was yours like ? When John was born . I was living in Central America at the time . We were hiking in the jungle when my water broke . Tried to get to the nearest town , but there wasn 't time . - Did you have anything for the pain ? - Bottle of dark rum . And John 's father ? He was right there with me . I remember holding his hand really tight . Gosh , how did you finally get out of there ? Hitched a ride on a chicken bus . Tobacco farmer handed out cigars . We smoked and then sang this birthday song . Oh , sing a little bit for me . My spanish is rusty and I 've never been able to sing . So ? I heard you were here . I was worried . - Is everything ... - We 're waiting on some test results . - I 'm Trevor . - Sarah . I should go . Unless you need something else . Maybe some magazines ? You know Jody ? A girl named Jody ? Hey , you know a girl named Jody ? You know a Jody ? You know Jody ? Hey , do you know a girl named Jody ? Hey , you know someone named Jody ? - Just checking in . What are you doing ? - Nothing . Cameron and I are shopping . - What are you doing ? - I took Kacy to the hospital . Is she okay ? They 're running a few tests . I 'm gonna be a while . - How long ? - I don 't know . Why ? Delicious ! - Who was that ? - Nobody . I gotta go . Thank you for taking the time to see me . I understand your reluctance to discuss these things over the phone . But I 'm pleased you 're still considering my job offer . I am . Thank you . I appreciate a man who 's calm and careful in his decision making . The last time I went hunting for these things you want me to hunt , 20 other people died . I won 't let that happen again . Nor should you . These things ... They 're evil . We have to be careful , Agent , not to anthropomorphize a machine . These are more than machines , Miss Weaver . But I 'll never make the mistake of thinking they 're human . Two years ago , my husband and I were in a helicopter accident . - He was killed . - I 'm sorry . He was flying us to Barstow . There was a microchip plant there doing some amazing things . So your husband was a pilot . He had over 700 hours on that particular helicopter . It was his passion . This is difficult for you . The Kulishov A-85 is a beautiful flying machine . Like the most perfect bird . It 's almost flawless in its design . Almost flawless ? It needs a human to fly it . Are you saying that ... machines make better decisions than humans ? What I think ... is that in certain extreme conditions , even the most calm and careful of men panic . Help me find this machine , Agent . You and I 'll take it apart piece by piece . I 'm not sure what we 'll find , but I doubt we 'll find evil . So much food . I know . We 're totally puking later . But whatever . It 's an occasion . - I like your necklace . - It 's cool , huh ? I got it from this awesome thrift store in Echo Park . So ... Two years ago , when I moved here from Michigan , I had this internship at a storefront in Chinatown . The designer was this total druggie . And when I finally called him out on what stuck up and talentless bitch he was , I got fired from my unpaid job . That 's when I started crashing with people and doing , you know , whatever ... for money ... Which got sketchy real quick . Especially in LA . The city is like a freak magnet . You 'd look really pretty in this . - We should bounce . - How much you get for it , bitch ? - Don 't know what you 're talking about . - My laptop , with all the stuff ? - I didn 't take your laptop , dude . - It just disappeared the day you left . Okay , look ... Who are you , huh ? You a little thief too ? Just take it . Go ! Please just go ! The next time I see you , you better have me something . All I 'm saying is sometimes you gotta take a punch once in a while in order to keep the cash ... That was a lot of cash . I 'm sorry . Fill it out so we can crash here for a couple of nights . - I don 't know what to write . - Doesn 't matter . Lie . The other catch is you have to have this interview with a counselor . Just BS your way through it . Don 't tell them anything real . Nice . Where 'd you learn how to do that ? I don 't know . You weren 't , like ... getting beaten up or anything , were you ? Sorry about that thing I said earlier about taking a punch . If you 've gotten your fill , I shouldn 't have said it . But don 't worry . From now on ... I got your back . Wasn 't easy getting that shot . Where was it ? Tanzania . Paul and I just got back a couple weeks ago . But you didn 't come here to talk about zebras . I was hoping you could run a check on someone for me ... Off the record . Who is it ? Catherine Weaver . Zeira Corp. - What 's your interest in her ? - Actually , she 's interested in me . She offered me a job . - You 're leaving the bureau ? - It 's just an offer , Lila . You 're not wearing your cross . How do you know ? The way you 're carrying yourself . What happened in North Hollywood ... That wasn 't your fault . Agent Ellison ? Got those updated 302s for you . Thank you , Liz . Glad you kept the name . It 's a good name . Where are you from , Alison ? I don 't remember . Where are you from , Alison ? I don 't remember ... You don 't remember what town you 're from ? Why does it matter ? It 's not there anymore . You know , sometimes when people forget , it 's because they need to forget ... because something painful has happened . I 'm wondering if something has happened to you . Tell me about your life . I live in a tunnel . I eat garbage for dinner . Anything you say in here is confidential . The only exception is if you were planning to harm someone ... - I would have to report that . - I would never hurt anyone . Tell me about your family . Memory is a very associative thing . Sometimes sights , sounds , even a smell can take us back . My father was an architect . He taught me how to draw . My mother was a music teacher . She 'd sit for hours and listen to Chopin . What 's that bracelet on your arm ? My sister gave it to me for my birthday . July 22nd ... I had a party in Griffith Park . All my friends were there . I saw a boy ride by on his silver mountain bike , and I told my dad ... That 's what I want . And he said next year . But I didn 't have a party the next year . No one did . Why not ? Everyone was dead . Why not ? It 's a Balinese tiger . Have you ever seen a real one ? Unfortately , they were hunted to extinction in the ' 30s . Do you ever think that could happen to us ? To humans ? Is that something you worry about ? I wanna go home . Where is home ? Palmdale . - Palmdale ? - That 's where I 'm from . Hey , do you know a Jody , by any chance ? Jody ? Do you know a Jody ? - Anybody here know a Jody ? - Yeah , yeah , I know her . She was here with some other chick . Do you know where she went ? But she hangs out at this halfway house sometimes on Yucca . Yucca . Thanks . Hungry ? Split my jell-o with you . Where 's Trevor ? He went to go get me some real food . He 's the baby daddy . In case you didn 't figure that out . - You never mentioned him . - We 've been on and off . He freaked when I got pregnant . But ... Now he 's here . I don 't know . Just ... I just want life to be perfect for him , you know ? Didn 't you feel that way ? Don 't get me wrong . I 'm not an idiot . I know it 'll never be perfect . It 's just ... Right now ... in there ... no one 's ever made fun of him , turned him down for a date . How long does he have , really , until he figures out how hard it can all be ? - Hello ? - Mom ? It 's me , Alison . I 'm sorry . You must have the wrong number . - Mrs. Young ? - Yes . This is Claire Young . I 'm here with your daughter . There must be some mistake . I don 't have a daughter . Not yet . Very pretty name , though , Alison . She didn 't even know who I was . Parents suck . Especially mothers . Why would she do that to me ? Who knows why anyone does anything ? Come on . Let 's go have some fun . Ah , ah . Sit . Eat . I insist . Thank you . You like tri-tip ? I grill a mean tri-tip . We could do a barbecue . With you and the kids . - John and ... What 's the girl 's name ? - Cameron . I can 't wait to meet ' em . If you want , I can take John to the range with me sometime . - He 's not much of a golfer . - Me neither . Guns . Trevor 's a cop . Detective . LAPD . We got the results . Cells were all maternal . The baby 's fine . We need to keep you overnight , but you can go home tomorrow . I knew it . He 's a fighter , this kid . Just like his mama . No criminal history . No pending SCC investigations . Nothing from FINCEN . Her CTRs all check out . - Not even a civil suit . - That 's good to know . James , before you make such a huge change , don 't you think you should talk to someone ? Marshal Weaver 's helicopter crash was due to mechanical failure ? You 're not listening to me . I talked to a couple of people . - It 's possible you 're suffering from ... - What people ? - Paul ? - He served in the Persian Gulf . He 's got experience with this kind of thing . I came to you in confidence . I 'm worried about you , James . I 've never seen you in so much pain . Yeah , we both know that 's not true . Thank you for the report . Yes ! I 'm gonna go get a soda . - What the hell are you doing ? - Playing foosball . - We 've gotta go . - Go ? Where ? - Home . - Home ? Who are you ? Cameron ... My name 's Alison . No , it 's not . It 's Cameron . I can 't explain this to you right now . We have to go before mom gets home . - You 're freaking me out . - I 'm freaking you out ? - You really not know who you are ? - I 'm Alison . From Palmdale . You 're not Alison . You 're not from Palmdale . You 're from the future . You 're a machine . A what ? The chip is messed up again , but I can fix you . - I fixed you once , remember ? - Fixed me ? Why would you fix me ? - Come on , we have to get out of here . - What did you do ? Did you hurt me ? Is there a problem ? No . I 'm her brother . John Baum . I don 't have a brother . Look , dude , I don 't know who you are , but I really think ... Sir , you need to leave . You shouldn 't have run . You 're just making things worse for yourself . Your hair . It 's so pretty . We work very hard on the hair to get it right . - I 'm not your enemy . - Right . I want to get to know you . You 're very brave . That must be why John Connor chose you . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I admire him , his determination . His spirit , his fearlessness . - I 'd like to meet him . - He wouldn 't want to meet you . They 're going to kill you . They 're going to kill every one of you . They 'll hunt you down until every human is gone , and you 're extinct . Then ... Why are we having this conversation ? Because some of us don 't want that . Some of us want peace . You were chosen , Alison , not just by John Connor , by us . Tell me where his camp is . I think ... I 'm a machine . A machine . What kind of machine ? From the future . What do you do in the future ? I 'm an infiltrator . What do you infiltrate ? The human resistance . I see . Why ? - It 's what I was programmed for . - Programmed . To find John Connor . Why 's he so important ? He 's the one who saves mankind . Saves them . From ... What ? Extinction . And what are you gonna do when you find John Connor ? I 'm going to kill him and hang his head on a pike for all to see . Your hair . It 's so pretty . Thanks . Tell me about your life . Why ? I want to get to know you . I don 't really like talking about my past . I came to LA to start over . Did you ? Yeah . Burned a lot of bridges here , though . Keep thinking I 'm gonna go someplace more authentic , you know , like Portland . I could come with you . We could reinvent ourselves . We could . So ... Who are you , really ? I 've never heard of you . Suddenly you 're Kacy 's best friend . I 'm just a neighbor . Sorry . Cop brain . Stresses her , you know . My job . You 'd think having a cop around would make her feel safe . She 's afraid it 'll follow me back home . Does it ? I can protect her . It 's your family , right ? You do what it takes . Sorry . Yeah . Right . There was a robbery / homicide downtown . I 'm gonna have to take off . What about tomorrow ? She 's gonna need a ride . I 'll be here . I just ... I hate for her to spend the night alone . Agent Ellison . Come in . This is my daughter Savannah . Sudoku . I used to love these . You have children , Agent Ellison ? No . - Do you want them ? - I did ... once . Very much . But my wife ... Well , my ex-wife ... wasn 't meant to be . Bye , Savannah . Your husband 's helicopter crash . I read the official report . The NTSB concluded that mechanical failure was to blame . Mechanical failure . Correct . That 's not what you led me to believe the other day . Correct . Which is it ? What 's the truth ? You tell me . I think ... what people write in reports ... when it 's official isn 't always true . I think if I had a child , one that I knew would grow up asking what happened to her daddy ... I think I would make sure that answer , the official answer , was the one I would want her to hear . I think you saw what you saw . Just as you saw what you saw . When can I start ? I used to babysit for this family five years ago . They were loaded . You said you moved here two years ago from Michigan . They usually hide a key here somewhere . Sweet ! You are jacked , girl . Look for cash and jewelry . Check this out . Saw the lady open it . And I memorized ... the combination . Just put it all in the bag . What are these ? Whatever . Just put ' em back . They 're the same as the necklace you gave me . Because I stole it when I worked here . You said , " I got it at this awesome thrift store in Echo Park . " Tell me about the necklace . Why are you making such a big deal out of this ? Tell me about the necklace . I didn 't buy it or steal it , okay ? It 's mine . This is ... my parents ' house . You lied to me . I told you where the camp was . You told me your sister gave you that bracelet . What does that have to do with anything ? We found these on some of your friends . Why are you all wearing them ? It has something to do with the Connor camp . No . It 's a pass . To get into the camp . You were going to send me without it . They would have known what I was . You lied to me . I 'll never help you get to John Connor . You already did . You lied to me . I 'm from LA , okay ? Let 's go . Tell me who you are . I went to Cal Arts for two years , and I got kicked out , which was for the best , because that place is a ... factory . And my parents cut me off like yours , and just pretend I don 't exist . We have to go . Now . Why ? Because there 's a silent alarm , and we tripped it when we walked in . You weren 't going to tell me . The police are gonna be here any second . You were never going to Portland . You were gonna run and leave me here to take the blame . No . You lied to me . You lied to me . I 'll never help you get to John Connor . No , no , no . What did you do ? What did you do ? We have to go . John . We have to go . Did you kill her ? Apparently not . - Where 's Trevor ? - He was called into work . Be back tomorrow to take you home . What 's wrong ? It wasn 't him that freaked out . It was me . - When I found out I was pregnant . - Cop thing . He told me . Yeah . Cop thing . It 's kinda cool and sexy when you 're a 25-year-old pastry chef making gourmet doughnuts at this hip cop hangout in Silverlake . When you think about breast-feeding your baby boy next to the walkie and the.9 millimeter ... Still ... He 's a good man . He 'll be a good dad . Kacy , I have to tell you something . That story about John 's birth , it wasn 't true . - The jungle ? - No , that part was true . The part about his father wasn 't . He wasn 't there with me . He died before John was born . Before I even knew I was pregnant . Why did you tell me that story ? 'Cause I wished it 's the way it could have been . That 's the saddest thing I 've ever heard . The thing is , I got through it . All of it . By myself . And so can you . Besides , you won 't be alone . I 'll be right next door . That was my last get out of jail free . Damn right . Where 'd you get that ? I got it at this awesome thrift store in Echo Park .

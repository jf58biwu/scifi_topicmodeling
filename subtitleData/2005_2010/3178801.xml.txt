Updated by Htam BIONIC WOMAN Season 01 Episode 02 Hello . I know becca 's been through a lot . And I 'm very patient with that up to a point . But smoking pot on campus , I have my limits . I couldn 't agree with you more . Now , we can expel her for this . Short of that , we can prevent her from doing any school activities , which includes the talent show this friday . Wait- - what ? No . Becca . Mrs. Buezy , I want to assure you i take this incident extremely seriously . Becca is gonna face repercussions at home . And I promise you I 'm gonna stay on top of the situation . But I would really love it if we could take the talent show off the table as a punishment . Since becca got involved with the drama department , I 've seen a big difference in her . She 's more positive , she 's more focused on school . And my fear is if you take that away from her , she 's gonna backslide . Of course , the decision is yours , but I just wanted to weigh in . Okay , you are good . Thanks . Smoking pot in the girl 's locker room ? You 're a cliche . First of all , pot 's not really a drug . It comes from the earth . And look at you . Just look at you . I mean , you 're obviously hung over . Shut up . Just shut up . Can you think of someone besides yourself just once ? What is wrong with you ? Nothing is wrong with me . You know how much i 've given up for you ? We were just at will 's funeral , and now I 'm being called to the principal 's office ? I don 't know , I mean , maybe I should just move in with Dad . Maybe you should . ' Cause apparently , I 'm doing a terrible job . My god . How many casualties ? I counted 1110 people from these images , but there 's every indication there 's more . Where did you get this ? It 's security camera footage . A contact gave it to me before the FBI confiscated it . What has the military said ? To me ? Nothing yet . Jonas , the media has been completely shut out , they have no idea what 's really going on . There is a complete cover-up . This seems like a biological attack to me . We need to get in there . Okay , let 's just--let 's take a beat , gather more intel . The last thing we need is a pissing match with the army . If you feel like singing a song I 'm such a bitch . I don 't know what 's wrong with me . Hey , honey , you just lost your fiance . And your sister 's acting like a twerp . So don 't be hard on yourself . Hi , I 'm so - - I 'm so sorry I 'm late . - You 're late . - I know . You didn 't tell her , did you ? If you told her , I 'm going to kill you . Hey , sweetie , what 's wrong ? Oh , nothing . I just got this weird ringing in my ear . Tell me what ? Big news . I just got into Columbia Law . - Really ? - They want me . I 'm in . I 'm going to be a scumbag lawyer , you guys . - That is so great . - Isn 't it ? - I 'm so happy for you . - Thank you . Isn 't that great ? And I think that you and I should go and visit her . Oh yes , please . Have you been to Greenwich Village yet ? No , I haven 't even been to New York . Because I met this amazing guy there . And maybe right now we should celebrate by shopping . I would love to , but I have this appointment . So you guys go . Carly , congratulations . That 's awesome . ~ There 's a light white light ~ ~ inside of you ~ ~ you 're think you might need somebody ~ You reading " What Color Is Your Parachute " ? Uh , yeah . Just , uh- - No , no , no . It 's a really good book . It changed my life totally . Really ? Yeah . How ? Well , I ended up starting a non-profit group that sends clean water systems to third world countries . Maybe I should buy this . Hey . Jack Russell ? It is . This is Scraps . And no , I didn 't name him . My niece did . I had one of these when I was a kid . So cute . Antonio . Jamie . Jamie Sommers . So , Jamie Sommers , you seriously considering a life change ? I don 't know . I- - I just got out of a relationship . He died actually . Oh . So sorry . I don 't know why i 'm telling you this . Sometimes it 's easier to talk to a stranger . Yeah . It just feels like all my friends are moving on with their lives , and I 'm stuck here reading " What Color Is Your Parachute " ? Well , maybe it 's true what they say , " what doesn 't kill you makes you stronger . You don 't know how true that is . Well , maybe you just need to take the time to figure out what , uh , Jamie Sommers has to offer the world , that 's all . All right ? Come on . We 're now in day two of crisis in paradise , as the mystery deepens . This small town in northwestern Idaho , population 201 , has been quarantined . Still no word as to the reason for the quarantine . But police have blocked off all access roads , and evacuated neighboring towns as a cautionary measure . Please stay with news channel 8 as we track the story . Hey . What are you doing ? Come on . How did you do that ? Pilates ? Yeah , I - I 'm listening to everything you 're saying . The answer 's still no . The answer 's no , and that 's non-negotiable . Yeah , yeah , yeah . We 'll talk about it later . I 'm sorry . Were you breaking up a terrorist cell ? It 's my daughter . 16 is too young to be on the pill , don 't you think ? Oh , um , well , I guess if she 's sexually active , it 's better to be safe than sorry . I think it 's too young . Don 't you want to know why I 'm here ? I know why you 're here . Saved that woman 's life and now you 're thinking , Jonas is right . I could have a larger purpose in my life . Go ahead . Feel free . Tell me . Say the words . " Jonas is right . " I 'm not gonna say that . However , this saving the world thing , I 'd like to give that a try . So here are my rules . I have to be home by 19 : 00 every night to have dinner with my sister . I don 't work weekends , and you have to get my sister on your health plan . Oh and this Friday night , I have to be at her school talent show . She 's doing number from " Annie Got Your Gun . " Anything else ? Yeah , my bionic ear has this ringing in it . We 're working on it . Send pope in . I need to introduce you to your supervisor . Actually , I think you two already met . Hello , Jamie . Small world , huh ? I keep trying to get in there with a Q-tip . You did not put a Q-tip in my ear . Your ear ? Okay what about now . Still ringing . Okay , what about now ? It 's- - no . It 's still ringing . It 's still there . Now . It 's still there . Really . Uh , it 's sort of like a dial tone only higher . Oh . What ? It 's probably something just loose somewhere or brain aneurysm . You people act like you have all the answers , but really , you don 't know anything about this stuff , do you ? This is- - Ah ! There 's one more thing I could try . Just try it . What are you doing ? You- - It stopped . Oh , my god . Krispy Kremes are always welcome . Food , booze , a nice hug . That ain 't gonna happen . Okay , surprise me then . Nathan , is she ready to start training ? She is all yours . So it wasn 't a chance meeting . You were just pretending to be Mr. Sensitive . Waiting for me to pick up What Color Is Your Parachute ? No , you picking up What Color is Your Parachute ? Is you picking up What Color is Your Parachute ? And you don 't have a Jack Russell . No , I don 't . But you knew i had one as kid , so you just went and got one . Well , actually , I borrowed one from the pet store up the street . She needed a walk . It worked out for everybody . So why 'd you get into a deep conversation with me at the bookstore ? I needed to find out if you were compromised . If you were with another agency . There are other agencies ? We 'll get into that . So what 'd you find out ? I found out that you 're smart , that you 're honest , that you don 't quite know who you are yet , and you 're sad right now . So what about the training ? Do I have to climb up a wall ? That 's up to Jae . Feeling any deja vu ? Sarah Corvus ? That 's exactly how she came at you . Exactly how you defended yourself . Just now you got the demo , the one programmed into your muscle memory . Combat programming . She was calibrating you and herself , knowing Sarah . You think just because you have machines inside you , that 's enough . That you 're invincible . The machine is nothing without the woman . We 're going beyond the demo , Jamie . Way beyond . ~ Sometimes they 'll wanna cut you down ~ ~ gotta scratch that itch 'cause the time is now ~ ~ they tell you that you 've gotta have a heart of steel ~ ~ if you wanna keep up , can you afford to feel ~ w ~ hen the system 's wrong , you gotta tear it down ~ ~ let it fall to the seabed like a rusty crown ~ ~ to the stars that love the moonbeam 's glare shackles on your feet ~ ~ that 'll disappear ~ ~ what if I tried to tell you to do what for ~ ~ can 't you see baby 's life 's knocking right at your doors ~ ~ he says ooh , I just don 't know for sure ~ ~ that I tried to tell you to do what for ~ ~ don 't give up , don 't give up don 't give up , ~ ~ don 't give up don 't give up , don 't give up ~ ~ don 't give up , don 't give up ~ You can run 60 miles per hour . Maybe faster . And you have enough power in your arm to shatter brick . And you can bend steel with your grip . That 's so Superman . You have 2 , 000 / 20 vision , which means you can see from 2 , 000 feet what other people can see from 20 . Your ear can isolate a conversation from two miles away as if it 's right in front of you . Now Jamie , if you hone your skills , you can become one of the most powerful weapons ever developed . But if you fail , you will go insane . Is that what happened to Sarah Corvus ? Did she go insane ? Is that why she killed will ? I don 't know . So yo were in love with her ? Where 'd you hear that ? I 'm a bartender . We hear things . Are you still in love with her ? I don 't know if love is the word . She killed 1110 of our agents and I shot her in the head . I could see how that experience might stay with a person . My loyalty is to this agency . Whatever I feel , Sarah Corvus is the enemy . Okay . Pick your poison . So what 's it gonna be ? You wanna spar , sprint , do pull-ups ? I got a better idea . How about you set me loose on some real bad guys ? Come on . You 're not ready . And plus , it 's not my decision . Whose decision is it ? Jonas , I need to go to Idaho . The Idaho situation 's being handled by FBI , CIA , and the army . Just let the government take care of their crisis . What if paradise is just a test-run ? A test-run for what ? I don 't know . Lemme go and find out . Uncle Sam doesn 't know the playbook on this as well as I do . You need somebody watching ' your six . Jae 's working on Sarah Corvus . Everybody else is either busy or dead . I could go with her . I 'm not a big fan of eavesdroppers . She 'll just slow me down . I 'm a lot faster than you are . Only at running . Jonas- - Field might not be a bad idea . Hang on a second . Keep me apprised . Let 's get a list of suspects generated . And have my office sound-proofed . Cool car . I know . '72 GTO ? So why are you here ? I didn 't- - No , I mean , why did you want to come with me ? I wanted to try to do something other than sit around thinking about about Will . Makes sense . Were you guys close ? First thing they teach you in this game is never get too close to anyone . How can you call it a game ? Second thing they teach you . Eyes open , mouth closed . Stop , stop . Ma 'am , this is a restricted area . I 'm expected . ENTERING PARADISE And who is she ? She 's my muscle . All right , here you go . All right , she 's clear . Let her through . Let her through . - Marty . - Back here . Marty works for the CDC . She 's under the impression that I work for the Department of Agriculture . Is it always the Department of Agriculture ? It 's whatever gets us in the door . If you don 't like this one , I got 11001000 more . Where are they holding the survivors ? There are no survivors . Everyone in the town 's dead . You okay ? How can you be so cool about it ? Look , if it 's any consolation , today 's a bad day . A really bad day . Don 't people have a right to know about this ? Well , what good would it do them ? They 'd just panic . And the truth is they don 't want to know . I mean , look at you . You just found out , and already you wish you didn 't know . Excuse me . Jonas . Yeah . What 's up ? The whole town 's dead . How ? An airborne synthetic called DMC30 . What do we know about it ? Everything . We developed it . We 're safe now . It was only toxic for 12 hours . I 'm going in to get samples and find a distribution system . But if I 'm right about this , then this is just the first domino ... All right , I 'll put a team on standby . I thought we didn 't have anybody . I 'll rent some guys . I 'll call Halliburton . So you guys developed the toxin that caused all this . Would you please stop eavesdropping ? Maybe if somebody said something to me for a change . Over here . COUPLES COUNSELING ? YOU KNOW WHERE TO FINE ME - -SARAH The security checkpoint 10100 miles northwest of Paradise was breached . What do you mean breached ? There was a distress call , and we lost all communication . Okay , let 's pull out all non-combat personnel . 447 00 : 26 : 24,500 - - 00 : 26 : 25,740 Oh , who 's there ? Jamie and Ruth . You sent Jamie Sommers in ? She 's only been here three days . Why would you do that ? How much time do we have ? I hear someone . It 's probably just the TV . No . Drop the toothbrush . Put your hands on your head . What are you doing here ? Can I spit ? Ruth , what are you doing ? Put the gun down . She 's just a kid . Where 's my grandma ? We need to talk . Mr. Park , it 's nice to have you back . It 's been a long time . Your wife is waiting for you upstairs . YELLOW ROSE HOTEL You were always very good at following instructions . You 're not gonna kill me twice , are you ? Sarah . Happy anniversary . oh , my god . I 'm just here visiting my grandparents . They were good to me . What--what did this ? That 's exactly what we 're trying to find out . Well , why am I the only one still alive ? I 'd like to figure that out too . Maybe you can help me . How ? Do you remember anything about this morning ? Anything that was out of the ordinary ? There was this weird truck driving around last night . Weird how ? I don 't know . It was like one of those big gas trucks . I just saw it when I was walking home . It was doing circles around the town . I 'll be back . Stay out of trouble . I feel like a freak . I can relate . You ? You don 't really look like a freak . Looking one way and being another is something I know something about . Confirmation ... Yes , sir . Safety 's off . Check the other quadrant . Ready to go ... you report it in yet ? Whoa , whoa . Hey , hey . Don 't worry . All right ? We 're the good guys , all right ? Now we need to get you out of here . There 's been a further complication . We 're closing in on the girl now . Okay . Can you run ? Yeah . Why ? Go . they 're on the move ! Spread out ! Who are those guys ? I don 't understand . What 's going on ? It 's okay , just stay calm . Who are you ? Uh ... that 's a long story . Look , you 're gonna be okay . People are gonna come and help us . Right now , just be quiet . I thought you said be quiet . I can 't talk now . Where the hell is my Tenacious D tee shirt ? Seriously , this is not a good time . Well , that 's fine , okay . Because I just wanted to let you know that Dad said it 's okay for me to move in with him . Okay , so you don 't have to worry about me anymore . Just go ahead and live your awesome life . Becca , don 't do anything until I get home . I want that tee shirt . Who was that ? My little sister . She hates me . I wanna check in these - - someone 's coming . Team leader 101 , notify your status . Get up , now ! Now , now ! I said now ! Vivian , are you okay ? Bitch . Jamie ? We 've gotta get out of here . Right now . All team leaders check in . They 've got heavy artillery , and they 're coming right this way . Nice work . We 'll leave ' em a little parting gift . Move , move . Let 's get in . Addison , you 're on point . Billings , back him up . On the ground now ! Get down , get down ! Get down , get down ! Lower your weapon . I said lower your weapon ! Get down on the ground now ! Get down ! Get down ! Let me see your hands ! Guess I 'm not too late . Who are you people ? We 're with the Department of Agriculture . I guess you got me . So now what ? I 'm not sure . I guess I 'll find out one way or the other . So will I. Why 'd you do it ? I 'm not in control . Like I told you then ... I wasn 't in control . I think someone hacked me . I watched you die . - And I - - I know . You didn 't have a choice . Are you okay ? Yeah , I guess . Thanks for all you did . That 's her . Is she the only one who survived ? She obviously has an immunity to the gas . So now all we need to find out is if there 's more of it out there , and who 's got it . How do we do that ? Just leave that up to me . Here 's the thing , I don 't like the sound of my own voice , so I 'm gonna ask you once to tell me where the DMC30 is . And where I can find a bunch of guys who dressed up as funny as you do . Or ... I 'm gonna get a pair of grip pliers , and I 'm gonna show you a little something that someone once showed me . Yeah ? Ruth was right . Paradise was just merely a test run . They 're rolling out 20 trucks midnight tonight . All right , I 'm on my way . 15 minutes ahead of schedule , sir . I 've gotta get this stuff to the trucks . Team- - move in . Go , go , go . Here we go . Down on the ground ! Down on the ground ! Get down ! Keep down , keep down , keep down ! Let me see your hands ! Let me see your hands ! Sir . The gas trucks in the stockyard ... loaded with DMC30 . Good job . Springfield , Jackson ... Portland . These guys were serious . You 're either thinking we just saved tens of thousands of people- - isn 't that a great feeling ? Or you 're thinking you knew the world was a scary place , but you didn 't know it was this scary . You just want to run off somewhere and hide . Which is it ? Both . Listen , I owe you an apology . I shouldn 't have sent you there . It was too soon . No , it wasn 't . I 'm in . It 's good to have you with us , Jamie Sommers . ~ If you feel like singing a song ~ ~ and you want other people to sing along ~ ~ and just sing what you feel ~ ~ don 't let anyone say it 's wrong ~ ~ and if you 're trying to paint a picture ~ ~ but you 're not sure which colors belong ~ ~ just paint what you see don 't let anyone say it 's wrong ~ You were so great You 're a star .

You 're never gonna live with dad . I just feel like i hold you back sometimes . You 're the only thing in my life that makes any sense right now . Sarah corvus is still alive . And you came all the way here to tell me that ? Good - bye , jae . Please give my regards to will . Tell him daddy says hello . Will ! we are gathered here today to honor william anthros . This is hard . - Listen , I 'm gonna go back to my life , and my job , and pretend none of this ever happened . Why did will have a file on me this thick ? I found it in his apartment , and it started two years before I met him . What are you people ? We 're a private clandestine group dedicated to stopping rogue organizations from ending civilization as we know it . Who are you ? - I 'm sarah corvus . The first bionic woman . Ta - da . Push it , jaime . I CANT DO IT I guess I 'm not used to thinking of myself as artificially intelligent . That 's not what I said . I said part of your programming includes artificial intelligence , the ability to learn . More importantly , to unlearn . Here we go . you see how you always defend the same way every time ? One more time . you can 't be too predictable , jaime . you can circumvent the programming , go way beyond what it intended . you 're telling me I can hack into myself , change the information ? All it takes is practice . how 's your salad ? It 's great . It 's a salad . You want to split a sundae ? Go to the movies later ? What are you doing ? I 'm trying to buy back your love because I 've been working so much . It 's gonna cost you a lot more than lunch . Okay , you know what I want . IM NOT * * * * HOW * * * * * JIAM THEY MAKE ME * * * * * * YOU CAN * * * * What about your new job ? I mean , shouldn 't consultant pay more than bartender ? Okay , if you can 't buy those jeans , I think you need to renegotiate . That 's not the point . The pols , you 're 15 years old . I 'm not buying you $ 170 jeans . Hey . I need you to do something for me . Can 'T . I 'm out with my sister . Who is it ? - It 's work . Ask for more money . I know where you are . That 's why I have something for you to do . You know where I am ? $ 50 million , you didn 't think we 'd throw in a gps ? Wait a minute , you have a tracker on me ? No one said anything about a tracker . What tracker ? - Nothing , it 's nothing . a block up the street , a guy with blond hair , green jacket , and glasses . He 's eating a falafel . who is he ? Suffice it to say , he 's a very bad man . He 's a bad man ? - Who 's a bad man ? Somebody 's sleeping with somebody else at work . This is not a good time . It never is . You want to have lunch with your sister or save the free world ? Didn 't you just give me a big speech about how I 'm not ready for any of this ? You 're not , but you 're the closest operative I have . All you have to do is make sure he doesn 't leave . Sit on him if you have to . We 'll be there in five minutes flat . What happens if he gets away ? Ask for more money . mass casualties . Listen , in the future , we really can 't stop to chit - chat like this . Here 's how it works . I say do something , and you do it . No , don 't tell me you have to go back to work . No , I don 'T .

Okay , listen . I 've been asked to make sure you don 't go anywhere , okay ? So is there any way we can wait here for five minutes until backup gets here ? Feel free to turn the radio on . Okay . Plan B. BONIC WOMAN Season 01 Episode 03 You were supposed to get one pair of jeans . I know , but they had all these shirts on sale . I got you one . And you were supposed to be here when I got back . Where 'd you go ? Bathroom . What the hell . Let 's go catch that movie . Yeah . I love you , I honestly do . You 're what gives my life meaning . You 're the only thing worth living for . Without you , I think I 'd die . Amazing . No flutters , nothing . We 've got to find a way to teach this . How do you do it , anyway ? I 've been married . What time does sommers come online ? Not my department . I was never into voyeurism , remember ? Can you explain the obsession people have typing little messages to each other with their thumbs , as if it 's somehow more convenient than just talking ? You 've got some bad ideas in your head these days , don 't you , sarah ? Feelings you don 't understand . Impulses to do things that ... frighten you . It 's the bionics , isn 't it ? They 've changed me , turned me into this thing . I can 't help you until I have more information . What information ? Meanwhile , I want you to take this . It 's for your nerves . It 'll calm you . Is the same thing going to start ho her ? I don 't know . The only way to be sure is to evaluate jaime sommers in person . If you found differences , could you help me ? Unlikely . But not impossible . You gotta trust me , sarah . I can make you feel better . At least for the time being . Just bring jaime sommers to me . Jonas , we need to talk about this tracker thing . How do you feel about canadians ? Don 't change the subject . So you thought it was okay to put a tracker inside my head ? Well , since we 're on the subject , we 're also streaming video from your head . Streaming what - - what ? So there 's a video camera in my eye ? It 's in your brain . I don 't know where to start . I want it out . I want it all out of my head . Well , you see , the whole thing 's grafted onto your cerebral cortex . We could take it out , but then you wouldn 't be able to move the left side of your body . This is an invasion of my privacy . It 's stripping me of my dignity , and it 's a little pervy . Pervy ? - It 's perverted . It 's for your own safety . - That is crap . It 's so you can watch me and watch your investment .  That 's also true . This conversation is not over . Okay . So why are you asking me about canadians ? This is heaven von fleet . She 's the daughter of a major canadian defense contractor . She 's gonna be visiting the U. S. For three days . Canada ? Do they even have an army ? Of course they do . They 're a country . Okay , so what 's it got to do with me ? Heaven 's father sells arms to the bosnians , which pissed off the serbs . There 's been a threat made on his life , and he 's insisting his daughter get 24 - hour protection while he 's here . So what are the chances of the serb militants coming over here and taking out this little , rich canadian girl ? Zero , but we do business with the guy , and he 's pulling a favor . And this involves me how ? Just make sure nothing happens to her . Nothing is gonna happen to her . - Exactly . So what ? I 'm a bionic babysitter ? That 's right . Come on , jaime , sometimes you get a softball . Instead of complaining about it , just enjoy it . I 'm glad you could come by and meet heaven . Tomorrow , I 'll need you here at 9 : 00 to pick her up . Sure . Oh , and one more thing . I should probably mention that my daughter is a little spirited . That 's great . What I mean to say is , while she 's under your watch , she is not to get a new tattoo , a new body piercing , consume any alcohol , or take any drugs . Uh , you know , my understanding was my job was just to keep her safe . Yes , well , I 've provided millions of dollars in revenue to berkut . I don 't think that 's a relationship you want to screw around with . Young lady , there is to be no smoking in this house . Shut up , dad . Get out . Get out ! Get out of my space ! I merely want to introduce - - the goon ? I see her . This whole thing is stupid , dad . It 's just a way of you trying to control me . I hate you . Hi , I 'm jaime sommers . I don 't need to know your name . Don 't talk to me . Walk five steps behind me at all times . Great . I 'll see you tomorrow then . I don 't know who you think I am wow , I cannot believe you 've never had a lesson . I don 't know who you think I am what 's up ? it 's nothing . It 's nothing . Everyone 's already there . You always do this . We always miss the fun stuff because you 're too slow . Don 't tempt me . Sissy . give me a sip . Oh , one sip , for god 's sake , come on . hey , one . Come on , anne , don 't bogart . There 's only one gulp left . There 's at least two . You 're not really gonna drink the rest of it , are you ? You don 't know me very well , do you , sarah ? I can 't believe you let mom get rid of kurt . Kurt . First of all , what kind of name was that for a pet ? Oh , he was adorable . Second , he was by far the stupidest animal i 've ever seen . All he did was lick himself all day . Yeah , well , you know what they say . Becca , don 'T . If people coulddo it - - becca . They 'd never leave the house . - You 're - - My god , becca . Like , how long did it take you to do all this ? Oh , I 'm not finished yet . Mom kept all the really cool stuff from that year we spent in D. C. Before she died . You really are the family packrat , aren 't you ? Think about it , jaime . It 's our family we 're talking about here . I mean , if there weren 't pictures , no one would ever know we existed . Oh , here , let me show you something . Check this out . Wow , that 's mom 's grandma , right ? Yep . It was just before she found out she was dying . Oh , well , she made it to 92 eventually . And later they discovered it was some kind of genetic disorder . She was 25 . Just a year older than you are now . Tick - tock . Not funny . How do you know all this stuff ? I mean , why is it important to you , digging around , learning all this stuff about our family ? I guess I just want to know the truth about everything . I don 't like secrets , jaime . We are the only two people with sub-retinal charged coupling devices implanted in our optic nerves . But our human brain still filters out things it doesn 't want us to see . Don 't let it ! See everything , jaime . We know what each other 's thinking ... if we want . wake up , jaime . Don 't even try it , honey . I know how you think . Having only one bionic arm shouldn 't be such a predictable weakness , jaime . the metal tip on that comb . The phone cord . Ooh , there 's an idea . The scissors in the desk . I know your instincts , jaime . We have the same baseline programming . I know you better than you know yourself , but not well enough . What is it this time , sarah ? I see they have you lojacked . So that gives me , what ? A coupledred seconds before they show up ? I can talk fast , but not that fast . Sir , there 's been a breach . Bathroom apartment window . This is why I said we needed 24 - hour surveillance . Well , sir , you also said to hold off on that . Something about her right to privacy . Situation one , now . I need you to help me . I need you to come with me so that - - you tried to kill me . You killed the only man i 've ever loved . Did you know I was pregnant ? Did you know you murdered my unborn child ? Glad to see there are still some things that can shut you up after all . And now you break into my house , threaten my family ? Tell me again how much you need me , you psychopathic freak . I need you to believe me . This wasn 't ever about you . Oh , just collateral damage , huh ? Do me a favor , sarah . Try not to make it worse by apologizing , okay ? I am not here to hurt you or your sister , and I promise I won 't , but in exchange , I need you to trust me this once . Meet me tomorrow , noon , sulfur plant . It 's by the ocean . It 's the only place we can talk where they can 't corner me . I need you to come alone . No back - up . Whether you know it or not , you need me too , jaime . Let 's see if the trust works both ways . I want her under lockdown now . I want this entire organization on full alert . Jonas . I want corvus found and brought in , dead if necessary . Roger that . I want her streaming optical interface tracked permanently . I don 't want her to make a move unless we know when , where , and why . Jonas ! - What ? ! I 'm not doing any of that . I 'm not hiding , and I 'm not running away . And you talking about me like I 'm not even in the room , like my opinion doesn 't matter , not exactly the attitude adjustment we talked about . It 's true , sir . We did talk about you chang - - all right . All right . I 'm sorry . Then here 's what I think we should do . I 'll draw sarah corvus out . But you 've got to promise to let me talk to her before you bring her in . Let me get close to her , find out what it is she wants . No , no . We have experts in that category . Great . I 'm sure your experts have a lot to talk about . Fine , fine . It 's a deal . You keep your appointment with sarah . We 'll be close , but we 'll stay back until you give us the signal to move in , okay , dirty harry ? Look , I think she 's in pain . You need to promise me if you bring her in , we 're gonna help her . Don 't make a liar out of me . Consider it a promise . She lost a sister . You know that , right ? Car accident . Sarah was driving . She pretty much went scorched earth after that . If sarah corvus wants something , she 'll tear through a wall to get it . Just make sure that wall isn 't you . Size 0 . I told you size 0 . Now ! I think it 's outrageous that in spite of the sarah corvus situation , I 'm still expected to babysit this little monster . Hey , you 're bionic , babe . Nathan , what I 'm looking for here is a little sympathy , okay ? I just want you to agree with me . I 'm trying to be your friend , dummy . Okay , um , you 're right . They 're wrong . Um , would it be , uh , inappropriate of me to ask you out for drinks ? Yes , completely inappropriate . God ! Oh , so you want me to be , like , one of your girlfriends . I have an idea . Why don 't you put me in a dress and a wig and call me stephanie , and we 'll have - oh , this is great . Just great . I gotta go . Hello . Why aren 't you on your way in ? You 're supposed to meet sarah in two hours . I 'm on my way . so how 's it going with the girl ? Great . I 'm all over it . Really ? 'Cause it looks to me like you lost her . Okay , you know what ? This camera in my eye , it sucks . It 's not a camera , it 's - - a total violation of privacy . You know what ? I 'm gonna call somebody . The justice department or hillary clinton - - she 'll get to the bottom of this . Jaime , just go find heaven so we don 't have to go to war with canada . I want it on my back . * * * * * I 'm thinking between my shoulder blades . * * * * * Somewhere my father will see it . * * * * What ? Come on . Is this punishment ? Is that what you 're doing ? Yeah , it 's punishment . Ooh , I 'm really scared . Oh , you should be . what is she doing here ? This is a top secret facility . Am I supposed to be impressed ? I 'm going out for a few hours . This is ruth . She 's gonna run a few tests on you . Is she a lesbian ? Have fun . Hey . - Hey . I 'm going to see sarah corvus soon . I 'm feeling a little in the dark . What does she want with me ? We think sarah corvus might be working with anthony anthros . Will 's father ? He escaped from prison . Treason . He tried to sell bionics to the highest bidder . Apparently , you and will didn 't talk very much . Apparently , I 'm the most gullible person on earth . So what does he want with sarah ? He created her . He designed her . He and will . So what do they want ? If I had to guess , I would say you . Okay . So I 'm here . Talk . I 'm sick . And I think you 're the only person who can help get me well . What do you mean , sick ? I don 't know what they told you , but I 've done some bad things . A few years ago , I - - I know , sarah . Jae shot me , and as far as the world was concerned , I was dead . But will revived me , surgically . He raised you from the dead ? How did he - - I don 't know , but whatever he did changed something in me . But it 's like my emotions were gone with it . I felt like a pure machine , like I could do anything , and I loved it . So why do you need me , sarah ? I 'm losing control again . Just take your medicine , sarah . You know it 'll make you feel better . Whatever will did to save me was temporary , but your implants , the way the anthrocytes interface with your body , it 's more advanced . If we can isolate those properties , we can make those adjustments in me . You can save my life , jaime . Let me ask you something . How well did you really know will ? How sure are you that the only reason you became a bionic candidate was because of the accident ? Will didn 't have any way of knowing you were gonna slam that truck into me , okay ? So your conspiracy theories don 't have any weight . How do you know I didn 't just expedite things ? How do you know you weren 't being primed anyway ? Used by a man looking for the next candidate to serve up . We 're finished talking . I don 't need you , sarah . You need me . I expected more from you , jaime . Shame on you . Run ! Move ! Move ! See anything ? I have no visual on her , sir . We lost her . Didn 't we have a deal ? Is this the way things work around here ? You were listening to everything big - brother style , right ? So what was sarah about to tell me that you didn 't want me to hear ? Am I a ticking time bomb too ? I 'm going after her , and if we can , we 're gonna help her . She killed 14 of my men , jaime . You know that . Good men . And that was a tragic thing . But that wasn 't her , and you know it . Oh , so you 're a supporter of the insanity defense ? No , I just think there 's a difference between going crazy and having your identity stolen from you . Which reminds me , your little video tap , I want it turned off . Nice move . Interesting things start happening once you learn to let go . You think sarah corvus is gonna bring gloves to a fight ? No . Something tells me that she 's gonna leave her little pads at home , and what we need to find now ... is the animal . Now we all know that if your training is worth a damn , by now , I should be able to take this crowbar and swing it as hard and as fast as humanly possible and never get within an inch of you . That 's right , boys and girls . I 'm about to get analog on your ass . So what do you say , sommers ? Are we ready to find the animal ? Bring it on , bitch . Are you insane ? You 're not finished ! jaime ! Enough . There 's the animal . Now she thinks i betrayed her . You did betray her . So what now ? You know her . What 's she gonna do next ? I don 't know . What I do know , she holds grudges . That 's great . That 's awesome . That 's super helpful , jae . Listen , you 're on the grid now . You have 24 - hour security . You 're not in this alone , okay ? I guess that helps . I gotta go . I 'm on an assignment . Heaven needs a pedicure . Now , let 's move on to your mother . Does she infantilize you also ? I 'd really like to stop now . That door is locked . Sit . How was it ? I 'm really sorry about ditching you at the store . I 'd really like to leave now . Okay . Thank you , ruth . That 's the second time . You suck ! I 'm sorry . What was that ? What are you doing here , sarah ? Getting a pedicure . Red , please . Can I have a water ? Of course . You 're looking better . It comes in waves , honey . Today is a good day . Who 's that ? They got you on baby detail ? Look , sarah , I 'm sorry I brought berkut with me before , okay ? You killed 14 people . You were lurking outside my window . Can 't you see this from my side ? Yes , I can . I see everything from your side . That 's the point . We need each other . I don 't think i need you , sarah . Are you sure about that ? Because there 's four serbian gangsters coming up to the salon right now , and I don 't think they 're here to get their nails done . Better watch out for the little princess over there . 3,2,1 . everybody out . - Heaven ! everybody out . - Get up ! Now ! I don 't suppose we could talk about this . I don 't think so . How about a little help over here ? I thought you said you didn 't need me . Okay , okay , I need you . I need you ! What 's the magic word ? Please . Bionics are great and all , but nothin ' beats a little firepower . Rock , paper , scissors for the last guy ? I 'm not sorry will 's dead . But I didn 't know you were pregnant , and I am sorry about that . But I need your help , jaime . I 'm dying . Your bionics are the only thing that can save me . What just happened ? A bunch of serbian dudes walked into a nail salon and tried toake you out . Nice . Look , you 're gonna be okay . Berkut is gonna follow us . It won 't make any fference if we move . I have this tracker in my eye . What are you talking about ? You 're starting to scare me . Get in the car and shut up . Sarah ! You haven 't figured out how to disable their gps yet ? You can do that ? - You have to . Those berkut guys look at you in the shower , you know . Oh , my god . Yeah , don 't even get me started on how objectifying this whole bionic woman thing is . They don 't tell you anything . That 's why you and me , we need to stick together , maybe form a union . Sarah , I have a lot of reasons not to trust you , and that 's not gonna change just because you say it should . Here 's how you do it . It 's like hacking into your own computer . You need to concentrate really hard , and visualize it . We should get out of here now . Adults are talking . Focus . And visualize . That sounds awfully new - agey . Look , jaime , you can do this . They don 't want you to know how powerful you are . Just trust me . Hack into your ocular tracking device in your cerebral cortex . Visualize the tracker . Disable it with your thoughts . I just did it . And you just got back a little dignity . How 's it feel ? Why is your nose bleeding ? Why don 't you hang yourself or something ? Look , let me cut to the chase . I want something from you . I want you to come with me to see anthros so they can study your technology and update me . When they put the bionics in me , the system , it wasn 't perfected . What is she talking about ? Shut up ! I will die within the year if you do not come with me and help me . Save my life , jaime . You 're a good girl . You like to help people . Help me . Help me save my life . I can 'T . I can 't go to anthros . I will not get cut up by will 's father . Besides , if I go with you , jonas will wipe out the compound with you and I in it long before your health improves . Come to berkut . We 'll do it there . And who 's gonna do the surgery ? Jonas ? Antonio ? The janitor ? Will 's dead . There 's not a surgeon there . You have to come with me . I can 'T . I 'm sorry . I wish I could , but I can 't risk it . It 's not just about me , sarah . I have a sister . I 'm her guardian . You know , our dad 's a flake . Our mom 's dead . We have no one . Yada , yada , yada , whatever . So you 're saying no ? I have no choice . Okay , then . Good luck . Where are you going , sarah ? I 'm gonna go lay down on the sidewalk andie . You don 't have to be so dramatic . Don 't I ? 'Cause I thought i was just told by the one person who could save my life that she 's got better things to do . That feels pretty dramatic to me . Not that I can actually feel anything , but I can intellectually imagine that that feels pretty dramatic . She 's scary . Yeah , I know . Daddy , I love you . Thank you . I 'm so gonna take up karate . Take care . Hello . Hey , becca , it 's me . Hey , okay , these jeans are , like , life - altering . I 'm on my way home . How about I pick up some chinese ? Yeah , sounds good . Bye . You 're losing control , sarah . Your denial will work with the others . It won 't work with me . I see you . You don 't see me . No ? What am I missing ? That you had a history of sick behavior even before you became a bionic candidate ? Before you killed your sister ? Stop saying that ! Okay . Maybe it 's true . Maybe jaime sommers really can help you get better . But you 're never gonna be able to trust her until she can truly relate to you . She 's never going to trust me . I can 't reach her . She 'll trust you when she can connect with who you are . When she gets to feel what you felt . You don 't know me very well , do you , sarah ? Grab your chopsticks , woman . Kung pao is in the house . Jaime , this is our new neighbor sarah . She 's moving in downstairs . It 's so nice to meet you , jaime . I love your sister . What a sweetheart . Welcome to the building , sarah . I love the building , and the apartments are great . And these windows are awesome . Yeah , yeah , I mean , you don 't see moldings like this everywhere . Great moldings , great moldings . Do you love the moldings ? I do . And the best thing is , is the neighborhood seems really safe . Yeah . I like to think that it is . Becca ! It 's okay . Just a little something i put in the tea . Don 't worry . She 's not dead ... yet ... as long as you come with me to anthros . Otherwise , I may have to take her out of the picture so you don 't feel so torn . Please don 't do this . I know what it feels like to lose a sister . I killed mine . Oops . It sucks . But I feel like there 's a silver lining . You 'll lose a sister , but you 'll gain more of me . You and I will be even more connected . It 'll be fun . We could even wear matching outfits . How do you look in capris ? You don 't want to do this . You don 't want to kill her . I know you think you 're this pure , aggressive animal , but that is not all of you . I know you loved jae and he loved you . I know you loved your sister . There is some humanity left in you . I can see it . Please . I 'm sorry . You bitch . They 're gonna be here any minute . Get the hell out of here . You chose berkut over me . You 're going to have to live with that . They will destroy you ! If you ever come near my sister again , I will kill you . You know will ? The guy you were in love with ? Did you know that he studied you like a lab rat ? That he cased you , worked you , set you up ? There was never any reality to any moment you ever thought you shared with him . Every look , every kiss , every word , every night . It was nothing . So remember that the next time you feel like you 're trusting someone . You meant nothing to him . It 's gonna be okay . I promise , it 's gonna be okay .

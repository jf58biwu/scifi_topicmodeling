 I can 't beat you . The FBI kicked me out for trying . I want you to consider becoming Echo 's handler . Everything 's going to be all right . Now that you 're here . She 's not going to ... ? Glitch ? She 's fine , Agent Ballard . My head is on fire . All you had to do was remember who you were . I remember everything . I 've been many people . Do you know who 's real ? Caroline . Will you help me ? Goodness gracious , but it is good to be out of doors . It certainly is . And aren 't little sister and aunt Sheila having a time , though . What a healthsome and robust young lady you are , too . You better watch out , aunt Sheila . Little sister 's playing to win ! No use in moaning about it . What ? Me ? Why I 'd love to join . All right . Don 't think I 'll be much match for little sister ! Now watch this drive . Aunt Sheila ! That 's not very sportsmanlike to just walk off because you don 't like the way the game is going , is it ? Right when it 's my turn to play , everyone wants to quit . Well , not this time . Oh ! Damn it ! Aunt Sheila ! This ... is not how we play the game ! Guess we have to find a new Aunt Sheila . Echo ? I 'm Echo . Uh ... hi . I wa ... I was looking for you . I 'm glad . Would you like , um ... a towel ? Yes , thank you . I 'm wet . Good day . Uh , treatment . Would you like a treatment ? Yes , please . I enjoy my treatments . Shall I dress ? Yes , dress would be good . And Mr. Ballard has been given his engagement ? He has . And any progress on locating our troubled missing employee ? She 's not really missing , is she ? She left . Well , I call that missing . I call that leaving . One doesn 't just leave this place . Claire did . Oh , Claire now , is it ? Dr. Saunders . Dr. Saunders ? Where is Dr. Saunders , please ? She 's not here , Victor . There is a man ... he 's not his best . Dr. Saunders can help him . Thank you , Victor . We 'll help him . And we can also keep looking for Dr. Saunders , yes ? How 's the patient ? Uh , not complaining . Considering he was hit by a car . Have we determined yet if the condition is reversible ? I have to finish mapping his neural landscape , but if I can figure out a way to sneak up behind his reticular activating system , give it a goose , that might do it . It could also give him a man reaction . I choose not to hear that . Do we really want to wake this guy up ? Mr. Langton , have you no charity ? We are working to reunite a desperate family with their wayward loved one . By wayward , do you mean that they 've been looking for him ever since he skipped his last bail hearing ? A bail hearing over a minor matter which has since been resolved . And by resolved , do you mean ... Yes , yes . A judge was bought off . There is no need to continue to translate me . In any event , Bradley Karrens is not only a valued client , he happens to be a major shareholder in our parent organization . If we can apply our resources to resolving his nephew 's slight medical condition , we do it . Report any progress . See ? We 're doing good . Uh-huh . Uh-oh . Uh , Boyd ? So your client is an Edmond Gossen . He 's a liberal arts professor at Clairfield College . Echo is being imprinted as one of his students . What 's the " R " stand for ? That 's the engagement designation . " R " means romance . As in R-rated ? Great . So she 's the sex fantasy for some egghead academic who can 't get one of his real students to sleep with him . Don 't you just feel like dancing ? Not overly . You know what it is ? Normally at this time , I 'm at yoga disco . So my body 's just sort programmed to do this . She 's not wrong . What is it , Thursday ? Tell me I didn 't miss Gossen 's lecture . He 's hard enough to understand even when you 're there . You 're fine . Paul here is going to see to it that you get there on time . Oh , thanks , Paul . I 'm Kiki . Kiki . First , Paul is going to take you on a little spree . Shopping or killing ? Joke . Good news on the coma front ? Uh ... yeah . Good news is that he 's in a coma . I beg your pardon ? Just show her what you showed me . This is a brain ... a healthy brain . Frankly , an overly smart brain . It 's my brain . And this is Terry Karrens ' brain . See these dark areas ? How they extend all the way out to here ? You know why that looks like that ? That 's because Terry Karrens doesn 't use that part of his brain . And that 'd be where you find stored such things as empathy , compassion , an aversion to disemboweling puppies . Basically , this is what some of your more famous serial killers ' brains look like . You 're quite certain of this ? Certain enough that I have serious ethical problems trying to wake him up . Topher has ethical problems . Topher . Way to land it . Judith , get me Bradley Karrens . Hello . You 're new . And of course , you 're always new . And who are we today ? She 's Kiki . Of course she is . Excuse me . Work order Echo . Echo ... Echo ... Who 's doing that ? I am . Right , okay . So not exactly a rocket scientist . Normally that would be irony , but , here , one never knows . Uh , Stacey , why don 't you take Ms. Kiki here on back and stick her in the works . Who 's going to pay for this ? Isn 't that cute . On the casa . Free ? Oui , oui . Did I win a prize ? You are a prize . How long is this going to take ? Changing their insides is nothing . Zip , zip . The outsides ... that 's art . Art takes time . Magazine ? I won 't even do this for my wife . I was trained at Quantico . Adelle , tell me there 's been a breakthrough . Of a kind . Can your people bring him back ? Convince me why they should . What ? Bradley , when you came to me with your request , you assured me that conventional medical science would fail to revive your nephew . That news of his condition would be a crushing blow to your brother , Terry 's father . All true . Yet somewhat incomplete , yes ? I encourage candor . I have a team standing by to return him to Mercy . A return to Mercy . That has a poetry . All right , all right . All right , when I told you the doctors said he couldn 't be revived , that was true . " Revived in time , " is what I neglected to add . In time for what ? Well , you are no doubt aware of Terry 's past , his troubles with the law ? Minor offenses . What you know about is only what the family hasn 't been able to scrub . There have been other ... indiscretions . Women , " survivors " I should call them . And when you have a survivor , you have a person that might be persuaded monetarily or by other means , to stay quiet . But when all you have are bodies ... I see . We can 't be certain , of course , but recent reports of abductions , missing persons might suggest ... Survivors ? Terry and I have always been close . If there are women out there , he 'd tell me . And I just know that if I can talk to him ... if he is to be questioned , we do it on my terms . Oh , I just ... My terms . That 's all . Yeah , and I just love these ... I 'll take her . What ? I 'll cover your engagement . You 're staying here . Why ? Turns out we have a sudden need for an FBI profiler . I suggested you . For what ? To interrogate a possible serial killer . " Serial killer " ? Thank God . Car ! Goodness gracious . Hello , Terry . Hello ? I 'd like to know if I 'm being charged with something . Do you know you have to charge me with something eventually ? I know my rights . How much does he know about who he is ? Where he is ? Straight brain dump . He is Terry Karrens . Right up to the moment he got hit by that car . I don 't understand why you won 't just let me speak with him . Mr. Ballard received his training from the FBI . He 's very experience in these matters . We defer to him . These missing persons reports ... why do you think he 's connected ? Just a hunch . No , that 's not a hunch . A 42-year-old woman from Covina , a 16-year-old girl from El Monte , a 20-year-old from Whittier and a 38-year-old from Alhambra . I don 't see a pattern here , for some reason you do . Who are these women ? Who are they to him ? They were in a real sense nobody . The authors of some of the most important medieval literature had no concept of self identity as we might understand it . We think of them as anonymous . They didn 't think of themselves at all . And I can see many of you would rather not be thinking of them , either . Okay , your essays on the economics of love in Chaucer 's the wife of bath are being returned to you . If you have questions or quibbles , my office is open . Excuse me . Professor , this can 't be right . Ms. Turner . Kiki . Okay , so I probably never should 've taken this course to begin with . But I figured it was mid-evil lit , not advanced evil . How hard could it be ? So I skipped intro to evil or whatever , but how is it I get an " F " when this guy that we 're reading , Chauncy , can 't even spell ? It 's Chaucer . It 's middle english . Right like hobbits or something . As I said , my office is open if you 'd care to discuss it . Yeah , I 'd care to discuss it . I 'm like the scarlet lady with the " F " on her chest . " A. " If only . The detail is exquisite . Huh ? Chaucer 's detail . Alisoun is his most fully realized character . Well , then he sucks , because I don 't get her . Really ? Because I think I can detect a little alisoun in you . Yeah ? Hello ? These cuffs are digging into my wrists . I have no circulation ! Hello ? ! Well , about time . " Terry Marion Karrens " ? Any part of that a boy 's name ? What ? So ... Terry ? I gotta ask and I think you know I gotta ask . Have you been practicing dentistry on large cats ? Leopards ? Pumas ? What ? I 'm just wondering why it is you have traces of a veterinary grade paralytic in your system ? I demand my phone call ! I want my attorney present . No attorneys , no phone calls . I know my rights . And no rights . You are in big trouble . When my family finds out what you 're doing , you and this entire department ... This isn 't a department . What ? And I 'm not a cop . What do you mean ? Who are you then ? What is this place ? This is the place you 're not in . And I 'm the guy you 're not talking to . And these ? These are the women you 're going to tell me how to find . I 've never seen any of these women before . Take another look , Terry . Squint if you have to . I told you I 've never seen these women before . I don 't know them . Let me help you out . Mother . Big sis . Little sis . And aunt Sheila . At least that 's how you know them . No . No-no-no-no-no . This is exactly the wrong approach to take with Terry . He needs to know you 're on his side . But we 're not on his side . Adelle , I know my nephew . And you should visit your nephew . Topher , escort Mr. Karrens downstairs where he can see for himself the care being provided . I 'm sure you 'll be impressed . He 's got his own private room and we 've kept him very ... clean . You know , Terry , when I was first told that this is what you did : Abducted women who looked like the women you grew up with . Who told you that ? I figured , " hell , the sick , little twist must 've killed his family . " It 's a whole norman bates thing . But no . Your real mother and sisters and your aunt are all still living in the family home . You know what that makes you . Very weird . I 'm not weird . No . No , you 're weird , Terry . But what you 're not is special . It doesn 't take a criminal profiler to figure you out . Maybe just a pimp . It 's ordinary . You 're ordinary . Maybe you got bottle-fed , maybe you got dumped . It doesn 't matter . At some point , you decided real people weren 't worth it . You pushed them away . Alienated everyone in your life so you could surround yourself with the fakes , the copies . It made you feel like you had some control . You 're not in control . Does this look like a guy who 's in control ? Goodness gracious . It ... it 's impossible . That can 't be me . Oh , it 's you , Terry . What is this ? You remember that car , don 't you ? You think you walked away from that without a scratch . Is that what you think ? This is a trick . Is it ? You need too tell me where to find those women , Terry . They 're the reason you 're in that bed . They 're the reason your uncle Brad looks so worried and they 're your only hope of ever getting up again . They did this to me . You did this to yourself . It 's her . That one . It 's all her fault . What about her ? Terry ? She made me . I didn 't mean to . I didn 't , I didn 't want to . She meant for this to happen . Oh , you bitch ! You bitch ! What did she make you do , Terry ? You just want to have a nice time . You want to have a nice day , but they won 't let you . Because they 're not nice . They are never nice . They care more about their dates and their boyfriends and they don 't pay attention to Terry . They never let Terry play . No time for Terry . They are ... whores . No , she 's not a whore . You 're saying she uses sex to get what she wants . Yeah , I 'm saying she 's a lusty , bawdy , self-aware woman . She doesn 't allow men to define her . She knows she 's the one with the real power . What power ? The same power that all women have . You make a nice day . You make shade . You put plastic umbrellas in the drinks . It doesn 't matter . It never matters . But I thought women back then had to do whatever a man said ? Alisoun knows better . Alisoun knows it 's all up to her . She can have what she wants . She knows how to get it . " Meself have been the whippe . " She is the whip . She 's the one in control . They never do what Terry wants . They always do what they want . She made me . It 's not my fault . She made me . Echo : So if she were here , and you were chauncy ... Chaucer , and he 's the author . Doesn 't matter . She 'd know how to get the " f " on her chest turned into an " a . " You 're learning . Not literature . But still ... but I can fix this . I can make this right . They 'll let me play again . We just need a new aunt Sheila . We know he 's killed at least one . The unfortunate , ubiquitous aunt Sheila . I wasn 't expecting that . I didn 't think he 'd cross that line , but it makes sense . She probably fought back . That 's why he was wandering around with traces of that paralytic in his system . He 'd lost a piece and was out looking to replace it when the accident happened . You gleaned quite a bit in there , all things considered . But not enough . By the way , smart move sending the uncle down there . Well , I knew what you had planned . I thought it might add a touch of pathos . He was really getting on your nerves , huh ? Couldn 't stand another moment . Yes ? What happened ? I ... I don 't know . His uncle was visiting him and then he went into cardiac arrest or something . Where is Bradley ? He 's right here . False alarm , it was nothing . How was that cacophony nothing ? Somebody tampered with the main lead . Come on . Bradley , this is entirely unacceptable . We tried it your way , addy . It didn 't work . Terry 's going to have a little chat with his unc . Everything will be fine . Now , Terry ... He 's refusing to pick up . Well , I would say this is a very positive turn of events . You think ? - I do , assuming your profile is correct . You still believe Terry Karrens will return to his victims ? I think he 's in the market for a new aunt Sheila . But yeah . All our actives are tagged with a gps strip . We can find them anywhere at any time . So if there are survivors , Victor will lead us to them . What do you mean he wasn 't tagged ? Why not ? They took his gps strip out before they started all that complicated facial reconstruction ; the scar removal . The surgery 's complete . Right , but Dr. Saunders is the one who signed off on having it taken out . And she kind of left before telling anybody to put it back . Lovely , so you 're saying that we 've imprinted an active as a serial killer and then blindly let him loose upon the streets ? I wasn 't saying that . Victor might not have a working gps in his body but maybe Bradley Karrens has one in his car . Oh ... Funny how my mind would never think to go there . What 's happening ? The stuff , it 's wearing off . Where is he ? I don 't know . He killed her . He killed her . I know , I know , He 's going to kill us , too . No , he isn 't . We won 't let him . What 's your name ? Megan . Megan . I 'm Robin . We have names . Remember that . We 're human . Not his toys . We 're getting out of here . Find a weakness . He 's on foot . Damn . Or maybe not on foot . What do you see ? Metrolink station . If he got on it , he could be anywhere from the Valley , Downtown , Hollywood ... The accident . The hit and run , where did it happen ? Just outside Beverly Hills . That has to be close to where he 's keeping the women . You think he 's headed back there ? Probably with a stop along the way to pick up a new aunt Sheila . The Hollywood line would put him straight towards Beverly Hills . Yeah . I 'm going to see if I can pick up his trail . Your one man manhunt 's using public transportation now ? Which is why you 're going to provide assurance . Beg pardon ? We cannot allow Victor to be used as Terry Karrens' vehicle for abduction and murder . I 'm personally against it . You need to free Victor of him . Love to . He 's not here . I do know this . A remote wipe ? It can 't be done . It can be done . Alpha did it with Echo . But he used a tonal interface . Serial killer Victor would need to have a phone . I need to have a tone . I 'd have to get him to answer the phone . Do you have his number ? Obviously not . Well ... ? Think another way . Think of it fast . " Upon an ambler easily she sat . Well wimpled , aye , and over all a hat . As broad as is a buckler or a targe . " A " targe " is a shield . Yeah , still not following . " A rug was tucked around her buttocks large . " I guess a fat ass was a good thing in the 1300 's . " And on her feet , a pair of spurs quite sharp . " Oh , nasty . " The remedies of love she knew perchance for of that art she 'd learned the old , old dance . " Liking that . Where 's your tune-age ? Don 't you just feel like dancing ? Yes . Are you feeling my bathy girl power ? 'Cause I 'm pretty sure I 'm feeling your boy power . Now , let 's talk about this " f . " Must be love . Or something . This is Boyd . Hey , Boyd , it 's Topher . We 're trying something in here and so we 're calling all the handlers in the field to let them know that I 'm going to be taking the biolink grid off-line for a few seconds . So , uh , when , uh , your screen goes dead , uh , there 's nothing to worry about . Okay . What are you trying ? Uh , a remote wipe . Why ? Oh , well ... Victor 's loose , doesn 't have gps and apparently , he 's a serial killer . Ah . So , what I 'm going to attempt to do is go into his biolink feed , which doesn 't tell me where he is , but it does give me a way into his head . I 'm going to reverse the signal , send a purgation tone and blow his mind . Literally . Then what ? Just leave him out there in his doll-state ? Totally wiped ? He 'll be an empty-headed robot wandering around Hollywood . He 'll be fine . We 'll find him . How will we know if we 're successful ? Um ... See this ? Right now , his vitals are doing the mamba . He 's excited about something . If the wipe takes , they should Flatten out . Go . Huh . You do have power over me . You are an incredible woman . What did you call me ? I am an incredible woman . Goodness gracious . Hello , Mr. Langton , how 's your evening out ? A lot like my evenings in . I 'm afraid there 's been a little bit of a situation here . Yeah . I spoke to topher . Did the remote wipe take ? It remains to be seen . The attempt seems to have thrown the entire system off-line . We 'll know all once topher has rebuilt it . Until then , we 're blind . We need to bring in all our field actives . Get them in pocket till the situation is resolved . I agree . You 'll take point on this ? Will do . I 'll start sending out the word . Then grab Echo and come home . Very good . I thought I would make a nice day , but they just won 't let me . You know what ? Now they don 't even get a new aunt Sheila . Yeah , full recall . Everybody 's coming home . Hang on . That 's my other line . This is Boyd . Cooper , did you end the engagement ? What ? Well , what ... ? Get back to the house . It 's fine . Everything 's going to be fine . Yeah . This is Boyd . I need an ambulance . So how did it happen ? Do we even know what happened ? My best guess ? I had to access the biolink grid for the remote wipe . I thought I isolated Victor , but everything must have gotten scrambled . So we assume Terry Karrens imprint somehow got transferred to Echo ? Either that , or my attempt to make her hot for teacher Really didn 't come off . If Terry is in Echo , where did Kiki go ? Am I drunk ? Hang on just a minute . I think we both know why . " I laugh when I think , how piteously a-nyght I made them swynke ! " You know what that means ? I have no idea , but it 's wicked filthy . How about buying a girl a drink before you swynke ? Okay . You think he might be what ? Look at that . You suck ! Trying to hit a girl ? ! Oh , Paul , Paul . Why did you ever leave me ? You got a problem ? I got it , I got it ! Go , go . Go . Let 's go . Oh , thank God . We thought that you were him . Oh , my God . I am him . Hello , ladies . Ready to finish our game ? She 's really hurt . She 's really hurt ? How do you think I feel ? You tried to kill me with a car . What ? ! What ? ! Don 't play stupid . You think I don 't know what 's going on here ? What you 've been up to ? We need to get her to a hospital . Oh , please , mother , always protecting your little princess . I am not your mother . Oh , then I guess I 'm not your son . You always said , " be a man . " You do make it a little difficult . You think ... you think you can make me dirty like you . I am not ... they are ... whores . You did this to me . Please , we just want to leave . I 'll just bet you do . Everybody always wants to leave Terry . How about you , aunt Sheila ? Huh ? You still feel like leaving ? Aunt Sheila ? Aunt Sheila doesn 't want to leave . I say we all take a tip from her . You 're staying . No ! No ! Did I fall asleep ? Don 't engage until we know the worm is dead . You have to kill it in the G-line . The wave is hiding . Why is it moving ? Because it 's designed to go where it 's not supposed to . It 's the whole point . The system 's still down ? Evidently . I see you 've made a friend . I 'm Kiki . Okay , I think we 're good . All right , where is she ? Beverly Hills . I think she 's gone shopping . Maybe they 're both Kiki . He was here . He 's still here . He wants to kill you . You have to kill him first . He 's coming back . He 's coming back ! Get away from the door . He won 't let me . What are you talking about ? Get away from the door ! You have to kill him . What do you mean ? We have to kill her . Yes . No problem . No ! No ! Yes . He 'll find you . He won 't stop . He 'll never stop , he can 't . What you 're saying doesn 't make sense . It doesn 't have to make sense ... it just is . He took you from a shopping mall . He followed you from your house . He 'd been watching you for days . Your little house , the yellow house . He watched you from the street . He sat in his car and he watched you . He could see your kitchen from the street . He saw the boy , the redheaded boy . He liked the way the boy looked at you . That 's why he took you . He 'll do it again . You need to stop him for that little boy . You won 't get another chance . Echo . Are you okay ? I don 't think so . Would you like a treatment ? I rather like him this way . Even though you asked me to get into his head , I never really could . His uncle 's having him transported back to the hospital this afternoon . Think he 'll ever wake up ? Wouldn 't it be nice if he didn 't . Good day . Good day . I think he dreams . Not anymore . Goodness gracious .

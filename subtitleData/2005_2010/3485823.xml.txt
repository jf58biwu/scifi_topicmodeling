He 's committed himself to a very destructive course . What ? We must save him . Believe me , I tried . It 's difficult to dissuade a man who 's decided he has nothing to live for . I 'll tell you the place where matt was last headed . * * * Thank you , dr.Suresh. * * * What 's it called again ? Coyote sands . Here it is . Looks like a million miles from nowhere . Why do we have to meet her there ? I have no idea . When your grandmother has a dream , it 's a good idea to pay attention . It appears my father was looking for information on an abandoned government project in the 1960s . Focusing on an " operation icarus . " Files are heavily redacted , but it mentions medical research and a place called coyote sands . My father was there . There 's cash in my purse . I 'm not here for your money . Noah . You say another word and you die . Noah , what are you doing ? Divorce papers ? Nice . Did you really think I wouldn 't notice that your signature doesn 't match ? What are you talking about ? Sandra never even left california , did she ? Noah , it 's me.It 's sandra . Shut up.I know who you are . Your mother 's name is anita . We honeymooned in puerto vallarta . - You 've done your homework . - You sleep on your left side . - Your joints ache when- - You can mind-read now ? - What ? - Who did you kill ? - Matt parkman ? - I didn 't kill anyone . Danko 's in on it , isn 't he ? He was going after james martin . Did he feed you his catch ? - Noah . - Answer me . Is danko in on it ? I don 't know what you 're talking about ! Noah ! Please , the kids.Don 't do this . Where 's your phone ? Where is it ? What ? In my coat pocket . Hello . Dad . Lyle , what do you need ? Um , I 'm supposed to give muggles some kind of pill while mom 's away . I forgot where she keeps the pills . Where are muggles ' pills ? I don 't know . Top shelf of the refrigerator on the left . Not the green bottle , the brown one . Top shelf of the fridge on the left . The green bottle or the brown one ? Brown . Get out . Sylar 's a shape-shifter . - Leave . - He came to me as you . You filed for divorce , you 'd changed the locks . Probably a good idea . No , no , sandra , don 't you understand ? This is exactly what he wants . Get out ! You gotta believe me . I do believe you , noah . But it doesn 't matter . It 's too late . I really want you to leave . Now . Alena . What are you doing here ? I don 't understand . You live here ? Damn it , alena , I 'm not gonna ask you again . How did you find me ? I brought her here . Parkman . What the hell did you do to her ? Inside.Both of you . Don 't even think about it . Even if this place is bugged , your soldiers won 't get here in time . So this is what you 've been reduced to ? What kind of garbage did you push into her head to get her to come along ? It didn 't take much , danko . Danko ? Why does he call you that ? And this place , you said you lived in chicago with your family . Stop , alena.Don 't listen to him.He 'll work you . Make you believe things that aren 't real . What 's the matter , emile ? What , are you worried she 's not gonna roll out the red carpet when she finds out what her boyfriend really does for a living ? Oh , shove the psychobabble , parkman . You have no idea who I am . I used to be a cop.I was surrounded by basket cases like you . Your job 's a nightmare , so you seek out anything to ease the pain . Nothing relationships . Fantasies of a normal life.Trust me , I 've been there . Go to hell . Your boyfriend kills people for a living . Jakob , tell me you are not this person . Go ahead , danko . Tell her . My name isn 't jakob . There is no family in chicago . No house . I 'm a soldier . I hunt people for the government . Son of a bitch . Tell her what you did to the woman I loved . All of it . The woman , millbrook ... daphne ... she was a threat . You killed her ? No , it 's worse than that . He had a choice , and he let her die . You were everything to me , jakob . Why did you lie ? Because I knew you couldn 't possibly love someone who did these things . You really care about her , don 't you ? This is the only way ... that you 're gonna truly understand ... what you did to me . Go ahead , parkman . But if you think killing her is gonna make a difference , or change how I feel about the program , forget it . Whatever you do , nothing 's ever gonna be more important to me than putting you and your friends down . My god , jakob . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . This is what he 's done to us . In his world there 's no room for mercy ... Jakob , no ! Go ahead . Finish it . Close one . Parkman ! Alena . Monster . Stay away from me . What is it , bennet ? Guess again . I went to bennet 's apartment and told his doorman that I forgot my key . Bennet 's old primatech files . Looks like he 's been holding out on you . I 'm not surprised . No ? Are you surprised now ? If I were sylar , I wouldn 't need this now , would I ? Gun . I knew he couldn 't have gotten to james martin alone . Not right under your nose . What do you want ? How dumb are you ? How did you think it was gonna end ? Who did you think would be left standing the minute sylar got bored ? You ? - What do you want ? - I want sylar on a platter . Then maybe I 'll overlook this pathetic little cry for help . He 's been going on assignment as agent donner , leader of team six . They 've been racking up a lot of wins lately . Where are they now ? On a mission . They should be back in an hour . I 'll wait . And so will you . I know you meant well , hiro , but I didn 't ask to be rescued . Dr.Suresh told us about your plan . It is one thing to defend yourself . But a true warrior knows the difference between a righteous battle and- - What , retribution ? See , that 's where you 're wrong . It 's the only thing that the other side understands . But that is why we are better than them . That is why we had to save you . Matt ! Finally . What 's going on ? I cannot make the face anymore . What 's with the kid ? Matt parkman , meet matt parkman . He is your son . Wait . My son ? We rescued him from government agents in california . He has a power like us . This is why you can 't give up . A boy needs his father . I have a son . I have a son . Outstanding.Great work . Wade . Good job . Agent donner . Yes , sir . A word , please ? I do something wrong ? Just wanted to say congrats . You guys have really been on a roll lately . Thank you , sir . This man is not donner . He 's sylar.He has shape-shifting abilities . Get a lock on the back of his head . Whoa , whoa , guys . It 's just me . Tell ' em , danko . I have no idea what you 're talking about . Agent danko has betrayed you . He and sylar are working against you . Guys , this is a huge mistake . Put the gun down , bennet . This is sylar . He 's killed a dozen agents , and danko is protecting him . Everybody , stand down . Look , you 're under a lot of stress . Yeah , because of the divorce and everything . How would you know a thing like that ? Everybody , freeze . This is sylar , and I can prove it . He 's gonna heal.You watch . Now get up . Get up.Get up . Get up ! He 's dead . Sylar was never even in the building . You just killed an innocent man . Nobody move . Put your weapons on the ground right now . Weapons down , or I will blow his head off . Get him ! I didn 't have a lot of options . I had to direct him somewhere . It seemed the safest choice . You almost got me killed.You could have said I was agent foster . Except if bennet shot foster , foster would be dead . I didn 't know you could bleed like that . I squeezed out a little extra . For show . Sandra , just called to say ... I don 't know what.I love you.I miss you . I miss my family . All my old numbers are burned . I can 't leave you this one . I 'll call again when it 's safe . Alena , it 's me . I know how you must feel . Betrayed . Angry.But what I said before , it 's not true . You mean so much to me . The way I am with you , it 's not a lie . Jakob prodasa is the man I want to be . I can 't do it without you . I 'm begging you . Please . Give me a chance to prove myself . I still don 't understand what we 're doing out here , mom . This is the place , peter . This is where our story really begins . Yeah ? Why did you call him here ? This family has to come together . Whatever has happened , nathan is still your brother . Yeah , well , I have a hard time believing that . Peter . Claire , it 's all right.Let him vent . Enough . There 's been too much misery in this place . What happened here , ma ? Why 'd you call us together ? I never wanted you to see this . Any of you . But I realize now that was a mistake . And to prepare for the future , you have to understand the past . You want the answers ? Then you 'll have to dig . It is our nature to protect our children . For each generation to pass on their cautionary tales to the next . So it is with the myth of icarus , the legend of a boy who fashioned wings from feathers and wax , daring to fly into the heavens . I need a light . His father was fearful and warned icarus to be careful . Find something ? Begging him not to tempt fate by flying too close to the sun . But in the end , the boy couldn 't resist . His waxen wings melted from the sun 's rays . Mom . And he plunged ... to his death . You know who that was ? I knew ... all of them . All of them ? Exactly how many are here , mom ? Keep digging . * * * * * * * * *

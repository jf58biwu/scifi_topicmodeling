 Then I accept your job offer . Enuka Okimba . Our new virologist . You mean the new virologist who wasn 't cleared by security ? Didn 't have to be vetted by any of our 3 governing bodies ? May you share everything with Bob . Someone had to be the first volunteer . - You 've had this procedure done ? - I have a heightened sense of empathy . I have a daughter at Sick Kids . I gave her up for adoption . You should contact the father . Are you still in touch with him ? - Are you the specialist ? - I 'm the father . We were hoping , after , you could still be a part of her life . If humans follow the same timeline as the monkeys , in a week , possibly two , Nina may begin to experience the same violent tendencies . No ! No ! Bob . Nina 's on the edge here . She needs to be someplace where she won 't harm herself or anybody else . ... Now Profound Joe , he knowed not to go down to the river when the moon full . He knowed 'cause his daddy seen the River Cat laying ' low under the bridge waiting ' fo ' the moon full . Waitin' for the little ones to come by ... Now Profound Joe , he told his little ones . Yes he did . Yes he did . But that little Lisa Jane , she don 't listen . Stubborn little , who didn 't think she was . One night , when the moon full , she decided to go down to the river to see fo ' herself . And Profound Joe , with his gun in his arms , he went a-runnin ' to find her . He was a-runnin ' and a-runnin ' . Runnin ' and a-runnin ' . And when he found her ... Mercy , what a sight . Lisa Jane , she be layin ' under the bridge white as the calla lilies they throw 'd on her grave the next day . Every drop of blood gone from her body into the belly of the River Cat that lay under the bridge , waiting fo ' a little one to come by when the moon full . My goodness , what do have we here ? A full moon . It used to scare the shit out of us . Jamila said , - she even saw the River Cat one night . - She 's making the whole thing up ? I don 't know . I haven 't talked to her yet . But Randy , her truck driving shit of a husband , he 's thinking that she 's just screwing with the system before the custody hearing . Telling everybody that your kid was dragged off by a fanged creature isn 't screwing with the system . That 's fucking crazy . She just , she does things like this , David . Well , clearly she 's got the kid hidden somewhere , right ? Maybe . So what are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna go there , find her , tell her to grow up . Quit playing games . When do you leave ? First thing in the morning . Who 's covering for you ? Carlos . Okay . Well , have a nice trip . I mean , you know ... No . Please , will you watch Louis ? Please , David . Just , just for a few days . And I promise I will be in my own place when I get back . Promise ? Promise . Alright . - I don 't hear anything . - Me neither . I should check this . Hang on . It 's Bob , I gotta take this . What ? Bob , slow down . Yeah . When ? When ? - What time is it ? - Midnight . Bob . I understand , take it easy . I 'm on my way . Right . - What ? - Nina 's got a blood clot or something . Oh shit . They don 't think she 's gonna make it through the night . ReGenesis 4x11 Bloodless Subtitles Team NorBAC Anyone , Bbsiocnarf , Dapitch666 Linwelin , Michvanilly Version NoTag 1.0 Hello . How 's she doing ? David , I want to marry her . Yeah , I know , Bob . And then we 're gonna buy a house , and we 're gonna get a puppy . And Nina 's gonna have a vegetable garden because she loves to garden . And ... Why is this happening , David ? Why can 't we fix it ? We will , Bob . We will . The neurologist said the next 24 hours for her are critical . I did this to her . No , Bob , no . I was playing God , I was manipulating the human species . I have no right to call myself a scientist ... You are a scientist . - A bad one . - No . A bad one gives up . Lets the virus win . I don 't know what to do . You pray . And you curse . And you hold her hand . You get her through the night . - You just get her though the night . - It 's hard . Look at me . You never give up . Okay . Thank you . I 'd appreciate it if you kept me informed along the way . Well , thanks Doctor . Carl ? What the hell are you doing here ? I heard about the young woman . - Heard about ? From who ? - How is she ? How are your boys holding up ? How is she ? Do you know her ? - I heard she had a psychotic episode . - Yeah . I guess you could say that . Were you able to correct the condition ? Why the interest ? I 'm interested in everything at NorBAC . Generally for a reason . Were you able to correct her condition ? We 're working on it . Right . Well , I 'd like to be kept up-to-date on her progress . Yeah , you and who else ? Still having trouble finding Roth for me , Carl ? We 're working on it . Asshole . Jamila ? What is it ? What is it ? They found him . They found Billy . Oh my God ... We walked up the creek to the falls . Billy went down to the water . I was getting our snack ... It 's okay ... I heard him scream . And I ran down to the creek . I saw it , Enuka . Dragging him off ... I 'm so sorry . It was the River Cat . No , honey . - That was only a story grammy told us . - I swear , Enuka , I saw it . - Baby , maybe it was a mountain lion ... - I know what it looks like ! It wasn 't a mountain lion . Okay ? Its ... Its teeth were huge . And his eyes ... And his eyes were on fire . - It was the River Cat , Enuka . - Honey ... Why can 't you just believe me ? - I can 't see anybody . - Okay , okay . Jamila Thompson ? I 'm her sister . Enuka Okimba . I 'd like to speak with Jamila Thompson . She 's resting . She just lost her child . Yes , I am aware of that . May I come in ? Are you Jamila Thompson ? - Yes I am . - What 's this about ? We have some information from the coroner 's office . You say this attack occurred up near Harbor Creek Falls about , what time was that ? I don 't know ... 6 : 30 ? 7 : 00 ? How long did you look for him ? Till it was dark . I couldn 't see anything ... Mrs. Thompson . We found the boy 's body within a hundred yards of the falls . You want to tell me how you missed him ? It was dark ! I don 't know ... It was the River Cat . The River Cat carried Billy off . And you got a real good look at this " River Cat , " did you ? Yes ! What are you saying ? I mean ... Why you questioning me like this ? I think we can talk about that down at the station house . The point is she 's stable for now . Do they have any idea what caused the clot ? No , they think her dopamine levels spiked . They think it 's tied to that . We know that Bob 's stem cells are tied to the increased dopamine levels . Fucking stem cells ! We have to get rid of the stem cells . We 've been going after the dopamine . But if we wipe out the stem cells ... away goes the dopamine . - And then Nina becomes sane again ? - Yeah . How 's she doing ? Better . How are you doing ? We 're all in agreement here , Bob . We need to destroy the stem cells that activated Nina 's Jacobson organ . I see . And how do we do that ? Okay . This all started when we sent a growth hormone up the optic nerve on the back of a herpes virus . But instead , it integrating to the DNA of Bob 's Jacobson 's organ . Right . So we have to wipe out the DNA . Or ... - we can wipe out the herpes virus . - Either one , they 're both connected . Herpes virus is a bigger target . Okay , you kill the virus while it 's replicating . Okay , well , herpes replicates due to stress , pH imbalance , injury . I 've been stressed lately , nothing seems to be happening . Some people get cold sores when they 're stressed ... - I 've never had a cold sore . - Ultraviolet can trigger cold sores ... Hard to get an ultraviolet light in Nina 's head . No look , the virus went in through the optic nerve if it 's gonna come out ... Bob , how 's your eye been feeling lately ? Any infections ? - Nope . - Irritations ? Sensitivity ? Last week ... I thought it was just because I was tired . My right eye was itchy a little . What were you doing last week ? I was at the Adele Seward Foundation the week before . Fucking hyperbaric chamber . Wait . There it is . Hyperbaric chamber . Pressurized oxygen gets into his brain , could cause oxidative stress , that could make the herpes virus pop out of the DNA . Then we can kill it . Sure . That 's worth a try . Sure . Wound was a clan puncture into the jugular . Ice pick . Maybe a screwdriver . Are you alright ? Could you ... Sure . So , could it have been an animal that did this ? I 'm not ruling it out . I mean , I guess you could say we got some anomalies here . Like ? Like when I opened up the boy , I only found one pint of blood . Boy his size and weight should have three or four quarts . But the jugular was punctured . That would explain ... Sure , the blood should have been found on the ground but ... I don 't know if you want to look at these ... These are photos of where they found the boy . - No ... - Yeah . Right . Well , point is there wasn 't any blood on the ground . Stabbing didn 't happen in that spot . So what if he was dragged by a mountain lion or a coyote . Couple of problems there . Sheriff said , " Didn 't find any drag marks or any blood trails . " And if it was an animal that did this , cat or coyote , why didn 't it eat its prey ? So you don 't think it could have been an animal . I guess it could have been scared off . Thanks , Doctor . Miss Okimba . There 's one other thing . Something that might just prove that your sister is telling the truth about an animal attack . What ? David , thank you . Thank Mayko . She call the Senator . You should have the keys to the city by now . - Believe me , I do . - So what 's going on ? No witnesses , circumstantial evidence , and they don 't want to believe anything she 's saying . - How 's she doing ? - They questioned her and sent her home . They can 't look at this kid and tell a bite mark from a screwdriver ? Get this : the coroner found some hair fibers under Billy 's fingernails and they sent it up to the Austin Crime Lab for a DNA test . They said no roots just hair stalks , void of DNA . - Said the hair couldn 't tell anything . - That 's bullshit . Sure they can . No , you need the roots of the hair to get a DNA read , David . Tom Gilbert , University of Copenhagen . He 's been working on DNA from mammoths they dug up from the permafrost . Apparently , the hair shaft 's keratin acts like a natural plastic protecting the mitochondrial DNA from degradation . Do you think you could ... You get me some of those hair samples , I 'll see what I can do . Okay , I 'm on it . Nina . If the chamber works , if the virus starts replicating , then we can kill it with the antivirals . - You don 't have to test it on yourself . - Yes I do . We have to make sure that what we 're trying is safe before we give it to you . You 're going to turn off your ... I 've been thinking . I mean , maybe , there 's a reason it stopped working as we evolved . You don 't believe that . You 're not supposed to know that I don 't believe that . I love you , Bob . I don 't need any special senses to believe that , Nina . I love you too . Go to sleep . I want you to go home . You need your rest too . I 'm with you . I am home , Nina . There you go ... Rest . You 're back . What happened ? Your sister hit me . What ? ! Where is she ? I don 't know . What did you do to her , Randy ? Get off it , Enuka . I didn 't do nothin ' . Why did she hit you ? Your sister 's sick . If you don 't think she did this to my boy ... - She didn 't do anything to Billy . - You don 't know her anymore . I ain 't moved out yet . Hello ? No she 's not . Haven 't got a clue . Yeah , sure , I see her , I 'll tell her . Who was it ? Somebody down at the Sheriff 's office . Said a local shot some kind of animal . Wants Jamila to take a look at it . So they think she 's telling the truth . - Randy , where is she ? - I said I don 't know . We got talking about what happened . She turned it into a fight , walked out the door ... Do you really think she could kill your son ? She said she 'd rather see Billy dead than giving him up to me ... What do you want me to believe ? Alright . You wanted hair , you got hair . Austin PD 's sending it . It 'll be here in the morning . Thanks . Just doing my job . Wait a minute . Did you hear about Hannah ? Sounds like the bone marrow transplant went really well . She could go home in a few weeks . Yeah , no , I heard . It 's good . I was gonna get her something . I don 't know , from the two of us . Okay ... Well , I was ... I was thinking of a savings bond . You know , we could start something now for her university . - Stupid . We should get her a bike . - No , no , that 's good . Yeah , I 'll do that with you . Yeah ? - Bob . - David . I think it 's time . - Jesus ... - No , Mayko , it 's good . I think we may have re-activated the virus . There it is . Just relax , Bob . Keep your eyes closed . It 's okay , Louis . It 's funny how ... animals , dogs , they worry so much about you . I 'll be fine . How long before the antiviral takes effect ? If it acts like any other herpes simplex , we should see results tomorrow . What ? Some farmer shot something down here this morning . - " Something " ? - Some kind of animal . I just got a look at it . I don 't know what it is , but it 's hideous . Listen , I got an idea . I was able to get some tissue from this thing , this animal down here , and I 'm thinking , if we compare it to the hair sample , that 's as good as a smoking gun , right ? If the DNA from the hair matches the DNA from the tissue , yeah . Good . Well the hair sample 's on its way . It should be there by morning . How are you holding up ? I 'm walking this line between screaming and crying . People here have their minds made up . Politics , their religion , their prejudices . If you need anything ... Thank you , David . I know this isn 't normal NorBAC business . Eh , what 's normal ? Hi , baby . They 're beautiful ... So are you ready to go ? Where 's your stuff ? Dr. Bruen wants to talk to us about the hyperbaric chamber . What 's there to talk about ? It works . It 's gone . I 'm sorry . No , it 's good . It means we can help you . It means we can be together for a long , long time . - How are we doing this morning ? - We 're good . So , are we still on schedule to take Nina to the Adele Seward Foundation ? Actually , there might be some complications ... I don 't understand . We talked on the phone this morning . You know why it 's important we do this as soon as possible . Well , I agreed to the hyperbaric chamber treatment before I had a chance to look at Nina 's functional MRI scans . We did a total cranial and body scan . Nina is 3 months pregnant . Now , everything looks good but there is something I want you both to understand . There is conflicting documentation on the effects of 100 % oxygen at high atmospheric pressure on fetal development . - Did you see this picture Enuka sent ? - I did . - What 's this thing ? - A coyote . - This is not a coyote . - It is , according to the DNA database . - What the hell happened to it ? - I 'll have to do a physical examination but I suspect the jaw line is a birth defect , canines overcompensating for the under bite . And the hair ? - You mean lack of it . - Check it out . A parasite : Cheyletiella Parasitivorax . Irritates the skin , causes the hair to fall out . It 's a fur mite that infests cats and dogs . - Coyotes ? - Absolutely . Well , now I know what we 're dealing with . Okay . Sequence the DNA - and see if we have a match . - Sure . - I have to talk to you , it 's important . - What 's wrong ? Some reports say hyperbaric treatment has no effect on developing foetus . Bob , you know as well as I do , those studies aren 't conclusive : non-randomized . They 're made with small sample sizes . But we can say that there is nothing obvious , conclusive , or adverse in the effects . Yeah , you could say that . So you 're saying we should do it . Yeah . No . No , Bob , we need to deal with the pregnancy . What do you mean ? Bob , think about it . What if Nina miscarries halfway through the dive ? It 'll take us at least half an hour to decompress the chamber before we can get her out . She could bleed to death . That 's very unlikely , David . And she ... We are willing to take that risk . Where is this coming from ? - How are your daughters doing , David ? - Oh , Jesus ! I 'm looking forward to being a father and raising a child so he 'd grow up - to be ... - Bob ! Stop it ! It 's human life , David . What about Nina 's life , Bob ? David ... - Just give us a minute , alright ? - Sure . No , it 's okay . We 're done . We 're going up to the hyperbaric chamber this afternoon . I want this to work out for you and Nina , I really do . I mean , this would 've started ... You saved my eyesight . Now let me save Nina . - Alright , I 'll go with you . - We 'll be okay . - You okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . What 's up ? So , the hair samples under the boy 's fingernail , not a match to the coyote tissue . What are we looking at ? We did a mitochondrial DNA analysis , compared it with the Barcode of Life database ... It clearly shows we 're dealing with an African Cheetah . In Texas ? The Cheetah disappeared from North America 10,000 years ago . I 've checked the local zoos , private menageries , there 's no reports of anything missing . What the fuck is going on ? This the latest chapter in a sordid tale that has sent shock waves throughout this community of 1500 residents . Jamila Thompson pled not guilty today . In the current county courthouse ... My boy was killed by a monster ! No bail was set for Mrs. Thompson release . And Circuit Court judge , Walter Timmons , ordered a psychological evaluation . Now you wonder why people think she 's crazy ? You know they ain 't gonna let me bury my son . Said they want to " preserve the evidence " . Never thought my little boy 's body would be ... " evidence " . What happened , Randy , to you and Jamila ? What happened ? I don 't know . Maybe it 's me . Being on the road all the time . Maybe Jamila just didn 't wanna be who she was no more . Didn 't want me . I 'm sorry , Randy . I 'm really sorry . What is it ? - Dr. Okimba ? - Dr. Winston . I think you might want to take a look at this ... Rancher who found it says he 's lost a couple other steers like this over the course of the last year or two . Just wrote it off as a mountain lion . Never paid it much mind . Till all this about the boy being killed . It 's been attacked . The jugular punctured . Bloodless . Same as my boy . - Something 's still out there . - Could be . How do we convince the Sheriff ? I thought you might be interested in this . I took it right out of the steer 's neck . - Why isn 't it beeping ? - Just hold still , Nina . Bob ? - It 's okay . - It 's not okay . It 's our baby . Sometimes it 's just hard to find the heartbeat . - But it 's in there . - Strong and healthy . I would like to do a chorionic villi sampling . - It 's simply ... - CVS . A procedure for the prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders in which small samples of placenta are obtained for chromosomal DNA analysis . It does require your permission at this early stage . Well , I think we should do it . I mean , with the hyperbaric treatment - and Nina 's pregnancy . - Good . I 'll get it arranged right away . Thanks , Dr. Bruen . What if they find something wrong ? They won 't . - I wanna have our baby . - And you will . And he 'll be strong and healthy . And he 'll be loved . " He " ? Just a guess ... - Enough marrow to do DNA test ? - Yeah , more than enough . I need to get a sample to the NHM see what they can tell us . - Okay . Tell me when you 're done ? - Sure . - When did you get back ? - About an hour ago . What 's going on ? - You wanna get a cup of coffee ? - Sure . - Carlos , when you get something ... - You 'll be the first to know . Okay , I 'll be back in an hour . - Jamila is scared to death . - Yeah . Well if we get a DNA match with the cheetah hair , it 'll be all over . I should have the DNA sequenced in a few hours . Okay guys , the tooth is not from a cheetah . What ? I was talking with one of the top guys who studies African cats . He said the tooth is too big to be from a cheetah . Too big even for a lion . So where does he think it came from ? Not a clue . - This doesn 't make any sense . - Okay , wait a second . The mitochondrial DNA says the hair came from a cheetah , right ? Yes . Mitochondrial DNA only reflects maternal lineage . Experts are saying it 's not cheetah . Shit . - I 'll need to see the entire genome . - Right . What makes us different is in the chromosomal DNA , not necessarily in the mitochondrial . I 'll get on it . I got a bad feeling about this . Let 's get this to David . We found cheetah DNA in the complete genome as well as puma DNA . So a female cheetah and a male puma were crossed ? That 'd be like crossing a human being and a chimp . No , but there 's something else going on in the DNA . And the BLAST could not identify this " something else " to a known feline . - Why not ? - Obviously it wasn 't in the data bank . - Something nobody 's seen before . - What about this ? We know that cheetahs and pumas have a common prehistoric ancestor , right ? They evolve , they split . And then 10,000 years ago , cheetahs disappeared from North America . How are they doing in Africa ? Natural breeding grounds have been reduced dramatically , subsequently the gene pool has shrunk to the point where all cheetahs are genetically linked . Exactly . So what if somebody wanted to widen the cheetah gene pool , right ? Give the species a chance to strengthen their own genetic structure . Like a genetically engineered , new generation cheetah ? I 'm thinking old generation . Something that 's closer to their prehistoric puma ancestors . Hold it . So you 're saying my nephew was killed by a prehistoric cat ? Like a saber-toothed tiger ? Kind of . Look , we know that prehistoric mammoth DNA has been catalogued , right ? What if somebody got their hands on some prehistoric puma DNA ? That would be a closer genetic link to a modern-day cheetah . You splice that in , you create an artificial cheetah designed for expanding the gene pool . And then maybe , it escaped . If someone succeeded and this got out ... You 're not about to hang up " Please help my find my lost " Prehistoric Kitten " sign up , are you ? Not if they knew their furry little lab experiment killed a 6-year-old boy . Carlos , I know the University of Oxford has been doing a lot of work with ... the DNA of prehistoric cats . Yeah . I 'll see if I can 't get a match to ours . Mayko , do you think you can get me a list of every lab , zoo , I don 't know , university labs researching feline genealogy ? Yeah , sure . But even if I do ... You find the lab , I 'll make them own up , believe me . We may never know who 's responsible for this . But if we 're right , It 's still out there . It 's likely to kill again . You wanna call the Sheriff ? Yeah , I will . Thanks . So we should begin to see results by this evening . Can we start taking her off the anti-depressants and neuroleptics ? Let see how she responds first . It 's gonna be fine . Sure it is . Excuse me . David 's worried about the baby . Don 't worry . Take good care of her , my friend . Thanks , Carlos . Excuse me . How 's the patient doing ? - As well as can be expected . - I understand she 's pregnant . - Where did you hear that ? - And the condition of the baby ? - Everything okay , David ? - It 's fine . - Carl and I , we were ... - We were just catching up . - I 'll get us a taxi . - I 'll be right there . Well ? When did you start working for Roth ? - I beg your pardon ? - That 's who you report to these days . - Don 't know what you 're talking about . - Really ? It 's kind of funny that a man such as yourself with all these connections , and political power and ambition , can 't seem to find the needle in a haystack . Difficult man to find . When did he put you on the payroll ? Take your hand off me . I 'll keep looking . Nevermind , I 'll do it myself . Oxford University got back to us . We 're definitely dealing with some engineered DNA . You still there ? Yeah . Yeah . This whole week has been about whether or not Jamila 's been telling the truth . She was . Yeah , this fucking place ... It shouldn 't have been about that , David . It should have been about what my baby sister 's been going through . Tell you what . Why don 't you take an extra week and make it about that . Yeah . - Thank you , David . - Sure . Uh , look I gotta go . There 's somebody at the door . I 'll see you next week ? Okay . Take care . You too . Hey Bob . Hey David . You have the CVS test results back ? We did . What is it ? Is the baby alright ? It 's fine . What 's wrong ? When I was a kid . I ... I got sick . Yeah ? Well I had myself checked again today . David , what happened to me ... The baby ... It can 't be mine . - Greetings from Moldova . - You 're kidding . WHO was called in on a mystery illness in a city called Birku . Over two hundred dead . Riddlemeyer would have an aneurysm if he caught us outside our jurisdiction . - I wanna go . - To Moldova ? ! I think Jack 's in some kind of trouble . - Who 's Emil Lupu ? - Moldovan Health Minister . The problem has been dealt with . The symptoms do not match the disease . This pregnancy is very very confusing . You have to consider termination . We need to find Roth . He has this corporate jet that he uses to fly down to the Turks and Caicos . - He has a place there ? - I know who you can ask . - Nina ... - Sure looks like her . I don 't know what Roth is up to . You haven 't ben in touch with him ? All I know is I 'm having a baby . That 's what I 'm concerned about . That son of a bitch has gone ahead and activated their Jacobson 's organ . Oh my God . I tried to make the world a better place . - Roth , we can still stop this . - It 's too late . Hey , Roth , take it easy !

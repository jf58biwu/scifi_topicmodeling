 ( Phone rings ) ( Phone continues ringing ) ANSWERPHONE : Hi , this is Lucy . Leave me a message . ( Beep ) Are you OK ? - What happened ? - I don 't know . Maybe I feel ... I feel a little sick . I 'm sorry I overreacted . - You were right . We should get to Summakor . - Yeah . Yeah , we should . Um ... maybe we could go inside first . - OK . - OK . Mm ... You have no idea how much I 've longed for this . ( Muzak ) WOMAN ON TV : Good morning , 6 ! Good morning . We all dream offinding our perfect partner . Well , now it 's yourturn to be matched . I 'm here to tell you about your appoint-appointment with the Modern Love Bureau . - You 've gotta be kidding me . - Let science take the risk out of , out of romance . Our high-tech system-system can find you the soul mate you deserve . 6 : This came under my door this morning . Well , it 's the way couples get together here . Why don 't you try it ? - And what would be the point ? - Well , you might meet someone you like . You might learn something about yourself . Or ... or maybe you already know everything there is to know about 6 and his feelings . What is it ? Something to do with the weather . Ambiance anomaly , apparently . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Don 't slip . WOMAN : We usually begin by asking our clients to talk about themselves a little bit in a relaxed but revealing sort of a way . It 's best if you don 't look directly into the camera as you talk , as it can come over as rather hectoring to a potential match . You really think you can manufacture love ? Since the introduction of blink-match technology , new data shows that extramarital affairs are down to a new low of 18 % in matched marriages . Blink-match technology . That 's great . We have enough to make a blink personality splice . ( Types on keyboard ) ( Distorted ) Ha ha ha ! ( Distorted ) Blink-match technology . I know what you 're trying to do to me . You 're trying to fix me up with some woman , some distraction . I 'm not staying here . I must admit , I find it sexy when a man has a touch of rebellion in him . I like the sparks . ( Laughs ) I have the same thing . I ... I like a relationship with a little edge to it . A man with a touch of mystery about him makes me feel curious about him . What do you think , 6 ? She 's free tomorrow . Would you like to meet her ? What ? Was that OK ? I just want to ... I want to lie here ... for a while . Is that OK ? Why not ? Can I let you into a secret ? I looked in your file . - ( Chuckles ) - I hope you don 't mind . No vacation . No relationships . I guess all those reports got to me a little bit . Let 's go . - What ? - Do something . - In fact , hit the enemy where it hurts . - OK . I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . I ... I don 't know what is up with me tonight . Do you think there 's a part of you that wants to betray him ? No . No part of me . I think there is . Or else , why do it ? Please . Oh , of course , yeah . ( Chuckles ) You have no choice in the matter . Let 's not pretend it is otherwise . You are a dreamer ... 313 . And dreamers vanish , as you know . But betrayal , it 's such a fascinating human attribute . And since we are passing the time of day here tonight ... Do I like you ? 313 : I don 't know . You don 't know me . Do you dream ? Do you tell yourselfthere will be a moment to somehow spring free from all ofthis and explain to him the impossibility ofyour predicament ? You were noble , decent , admirable . You didn 't really forsake him . And you will be a liar . Indulge me . To betray someone you love - and I don 't mean a kiss behind the filing cabinet , a Thursday afternoon liaison , a seedy night in a hotel - I mean to fundamentally betray someone you love . That is ... Would I like you if I knew you ? I don 't know . I 've long believed that we look for beauty in all the wrong places . You see , ifyou betray the one person you love , then there must be something you want more than her or his love . Well , he 'll be with us soon enough . ( Groans ) Good morning , 6 . Time for matching ... ( Doorbell rings ) Time for matching stage two ! ♪ Latin jazz I 'm 4-15 . Really ? I 'm not what you expected ? Oh , yes , you are . You 're ... exactly what I expected . ( Laughs ) There was something in your voice . I don 't miss that kind ofthing . Those matching people know their stuff . Can I ask you about yourself ? Jump in . What do you wanna know ? I don 't know . Where do you live ? Over the bridge , apartment 415 . But you haven 't lived there long ? Ever since I left my parents ' home . Are you sure ? I think I would know . ( Laughs ) You 're kinda strange , 6 . I like it . You can ask . It 's OK . How did it happen ? There 's nothing wrong with my eyes . I was six years old . I woke up one morning and they 'd stopped working . They said it was caused by some kind oftrauma . Something happened when I was asleep . Do you mind ? Oh ... Nice bones . I like . I feel like I know you already , like we 've met before in some ... whole other life . 6 ... you really are strange . But you mean it , I can hear that . 4-15 ... I 'd like to get to know you . Well , that 's what we 're here for . I 'd like to get to know you tonight . Oh ... This isn 't like me at all ... really . Ask anyone who knows me . No surprises . No sudden moves . And then all this ? It 's like ... the dials are spinning . And here I am ... .. letting go . Maybe that 's ... What ? Maybe that 's how love takes us . ( Cars horn blare ) - We should ... - OK . - What was that ? - Oh , the purpose for ... Um ... but then ... Who needs purpose ? Did anyone tell you ... you have the most enchanting eyes ? Are you sure you 're OK ? Just some kind of bug . ( Whispered voices ) What is it ? - What if it 's true ? - Hm ? What ifwe had ... What ifwe had one night together ? In some other life ... before the Village . 6 , no-one can be so hopelessly romantic . What if I know it 's real ... .. that I can remember it ... .. remember us ? Come here . You were standing in the window ... .. just like this . Lucy ? What did ... ? What did you call me ? You know something , don 't you ? Well , yes , I know it 's crazy to talk like this . Some other life ? I have to go . I 'm sorry . I promise I won 't talk about these crazy things . OK . Let 's just slow it all down , OK ? I 'll go now and I 'll see you tomorrow . You and me , in this other life ... .. where did our story end ? I don 't recall . ( Groans ) You 're a friend of 6 's ? - 6 trusts you . - You 'll have to ask him that . I already did . Oh . What are they ? I want to know what 's in them ... what they do . - Look , I 'm not a chemist . I can 't ... - But you can find out for me . I have a question for you . Is 6 a crazy ? No . No , he 's not . ( Door opens and closes ) You want to know about him ? About 6 ? About holes ? It 's all right , 1 1-12 . It was always my intention to tell you . I didn 't bargain for 6 pushing things along ... in that 6 way of his . If you know ... it will change everything . There will be no going back to innocence . I want to know . You want to know . About your mother ? To know about my mother . Yay , yay , yay , yay , yeah ! I should report it , right ? Should I report it ? Could be a way out of here . WOMAN : Cake 's out ofthe oven ! I 'm gonna have some cake and er ... then maybe I 'll report it . 832 ! Whee ! I 'll call the clinic before they find out about it . ( Laughs ) She likes you , 6 . I think it 's the cake she likes . Yeah . Yeah , I wanna report something in my garden . How did your date go , 6 ? She knows something ... .. but she won 't admit it . All righty , who 's going to make the toast ? - ( Cork pops ) - Ooh ! Even I have to admit , there must be something to this matching thing , if it brought you two together . ( Laughter ) Yay , yay , yeah , yeah yeah ! - Cheers . - Cheers . Where 's 832 ? Yay , yay , yeah . ♪ La , la , la , la , la ... Whee ! 832 . 832 ! 832 ! She 's ... 832 ! Hey , what are you doing ? Hey , get off of me ! - What are you doing ? My baby is down there ! - It 's an ambience anomaly . - My baby is ... - They can 't leave . They have to get their child back . - What are you doing ? My baby is in there ! - You report any child lost at central office . You left the door open . TANNOY : In the latest move to combat ambiance anomalies , the clinic has announced that every home is to be given a pig . Studies have shown conclusively that swine breath is a proven atmosphere stabiliser , and scientists are confident that this will reduce significantly the risk offurther disturbances in the short to medium future . Moreover , if you order now , you can get two . Some friends of mine have lost their child . She 's fallen down into a hole . It 's not the weather ! People want something they can believe in , 6 . It is the weather . They want to come together and make a difference . They volunteer for pig distribution duties . They love that ! And then we can all get on with our wonderful lives , our families , our romances . And what about you , 6 ? Don 't you have a head full of her ? Tell the truth . Tell yourselfthe truth . Wouldn 't you rather be with 4-15 ? Hm ? Aren 't you just longing to be at her ? Know what I mean ? " At her " ? Isn 't that more human ? No . It 's destroying them - my friends - not knowing where their child is . The only way of knowing , the only possibility of getting the child back is to go after her . You choose , you decide . Well , if you 're telling me I can go in there and save that little girl ... I 'll do it . And you 'd do that without knowing what 's down there , for someone else 's child ? What is this thing ? It 's a nothing . It 's oblivion . It 's beyond all hope . The child is gone , 6 . ( Soft buzz ) - Does he not love her enough now ? 2 : Oh , no . He 's hardly begun . What he feels only scrapes at the skin of love . Let him go where love is terrible . Is it possible to love someone too much ? I mean ... Does he have to come in here every night ? Love is a torment or it is not love . It 'll crack him right open . And then , we can see the 6 inside . The inside 6 . He can 't understand why you don 't kill him . Perhaps , we will kill her ... when we get to that place . How would that feel ? I don 't want you to kill her . We always save our best lies for ourselves . Do I like you ? Come up to the house . Would you like that ? I 'd like you to sit with me . Sit with me ... .. and see . ( Pig grunting ) What do you make ofthis holes business , 6 ? I know it 's got nothing to do with the weather . I gotta take this thing seriously , you know ? That 's why we 've got ourselves two pigs . We 're a two-pig family . - Leave that alone ! Come on ! No ! - ( Pigs squeal ) No ! She was such an adventurous kid . Damn , I 've asked myself a thousand times . Why my little girl ? 29-44 ... Has 4-15 been away in the last few weeks ? Away ? Where , son ? We 've seen our little girl every single day since she was ... since ... What did we do wrong ? Did we not love her enough ? We still hope , you know , for ... that there will be a little miracle . Now that she 's been matched , she 's so happy , maybe this is it . What do you say , 6 ?

A cocktail of sedatives . Extremely powerful sleeping draught . A hallucinogen . A type I 've never come across before . It contains a compound that 's not on our records . This is ... Well ... This has no known contents . How could they match me with a man like that , hm ? Look at him . He does nothing . Sit with me , 313 . Please , w ... why am I here ? If I ... touch your hair ... you can refuse . We can all refuse . We have choices , so long as we can live with the consequences . Oh , damned consequences , huh ? And if I touch your face ... .. if I touch you here ... in this room ... she can sense us , I know she can . Oh , it 'd break her heart . I can remove 4-15 . And you can have 6 all to yourself . No , I ... I want him to choose . My question for you is the treatment . Can you do it in reverse ? Can ... you get rid ofthis longing ? I 'm not sure . B-But , yes . It must be possible . But the er ... signs can work in a contrary direction , and ... we can make someone ... Unlove . She 's right . I ... do ... nothing ! We will not be doing any such thing , of course . Why should we ? But we know that it is there , you and I ... if either of us should ever need it . Go and be with him . That is what you want . 6 : They come in the night and take me .

Now see how different he looks . He is - how shall we describe it ? He is touched . We should be amazed by love , by its capacity to make us and to ruin us .

Gene symmetry therapy . We scanned the brains of people who 'd fallen in love and we discovered - and you 'll like this , 6 - that the more there was gene similarity between people , the more they fell in love . And so we replicated by transplanting 4-15 's genes ... into you . I feel ... Your emotions are manufactured , 6 . But what did I feel ... before you gave me these feelings ? If you can do this ... .. what is love ? You defied me , 313 . A little reckless , perhaps . Your punishment is already in you . And now that you know the way ofthings , 6 , do you still want to marry her ? - Do you ? - Yes . Good . Now ... ( Whispered voice ) This isn 't me . Somebody is making this happen . I have to go . Yes . One thing first . Breakfast . Tell me what you want for breakfast . Isn 't that the same ? Ifwe don 't go , isn 't that what they want ? I just want to buy you breakfast . ( Laughs ) Oranges . Hey ! What ? Where are we going with this ? You tell me . I don 't know . I ... - I feel like saying ... - No . Marry me . Ssh ! It 'll keep . You like to push it , don 't you , 6 ?

What is it ? - What 's happening ? - Did he kiss her ? Is that what happened here ? 29-44 : Honey . Honey . You really are rather smitten , aren 't you , 313 ? What you will never know , of course , is whether your feelings are genuine ... or ... I have to go . I 'm not safe for you to be around . Whatever you do , stay away . We 'll come back to this , I promise . No ! What 's going on ? Are you OK ? What ifwe said , what ifwe promised each other we 'd ... we 'd always come back to this , we 'd never let us go ? Lucy ? Lucy . Where am I ? We 're out in the desert , Lucy . What did you call me ? We 've met before . I know that for you to hear this might not make any sense , but you 're called Lucy .

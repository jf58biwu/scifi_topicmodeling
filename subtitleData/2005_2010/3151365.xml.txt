 I ... didn 't want to . I 'm not in control . I know . Tell me you love me . I love you . We 're out of Stoly ! Becca ! - What ? - The music 's too loud . What now ? Why is the door locked ? What are you doing ? Where is it ? Where 's what ? You 're not allowed to be near a computer plugged into a phone line Or would I have to show you the court order . - Why don 't you email it to me ? - Becca . Go ahead , tear the room apart , do you see a computer in here ? No . That means the only thing that it 's in here that doesn 't belong is drum roll please , you I 'm driving you to school in ten minutes . Too easy . That 's not real food . You 're not a real mum . What 's your problem ? You know , dad didn 't try to control me . - Dad trusted me , OK ? - Dad left you up on my doorstep . If you want to live with dad , live with dad , if you can find him . Here 's what to do . Look for a big protest rally . You 'll find him at the nearest bar . You think you remember , but you don 't . The victim of a Baghdad car bombing . Needed transplants , and facial reconstructions . This triathlete was told he would never compete again . For some women , bigger is better . What these people have in common is that they have each on some level , ... altered themselves . Butt where is the threshold ? When is it okay , to intervene in God 's work ? This question is the very cornerstone of bioethics , and we 're gonna spend the rest of the semester dealing with it . Come on , Will . I am a bartender and a dropout . - You 're a professor . - And a surgeon . How can you take me seriously ? What makes you think I take you seriously ? Do you ? Why are you with me ? You 're different . From what ? When your whole life 's planned out for you while you 're still in the womb , it kinda kills the mystery . And then you came along , and you were ... - ... unexpected . - Unexpected ? The one choice my father didn 't make for me . I gotta run . - We 're still on for dinner ? - 8 o 'clock ? Make it 8 : 30 , I have to go to the lab for a few hours . While we 're on the subject , why are you with me ? You 're not entirely uncharming . It 's insulting . The last time I left you alone , you started a fire . - The microwave was broken ! - We don 't have a microwave . - Look , the weird ! - They 're my friends . - Then they 're your weird friends . - Please , for me . Tomorrow night . Double feature ? Deal . You look rocken . I brought pheromones . I gotta go , I 'm gonna be late . - Be good . - Have fun . I think there 's a pretty good chance the grant could come through . The institute 's indicating it 's a done deal . And I hear Paris is great in the spring . You 're not happy . Of course I 'm happy . Because I think you should come with me . I can 't . - Why not ? - I have a job . Jaime ! And a life ! - We 're talking Paris . - And I have responsabilities . - Did I mention it 's Paris . - I 'm pregnant . Yeah , that 's what I said . I don 't want you to ... I just ... I know this isn 't something you just spring on someone except for the part where that 's exactly what I 'm doing to you right now , and ... I know you 're in a place where you can 't even think about it , and God , I 'm only 24 , it 's not , I mean , I said to myself , - there 's only one thing to do , but ... - Five months , fourteen days . That 's how long we 've been dating . Jaime , if someone had asked me five months and fifteen days ago ... if I believed in love at first sight , I would 've said I absolutely did not . And the very next day , I would 've been proven wrong . - Will ... - Marry me . So I 'm thinking Coltrane if it 's a boy ... Billie if it 's a girl . You don 't have to do this , you know . Actually , I 'm pretty sure you have to name them . - I mean you didn 't have to ... - I know , but I 'm still asking . So what does that tell you ? Jaime . Jaime . That 's not an internal bleeding . Extensive crush injuries to right arm and both legs . - She 's coming up ! - I need 5 more grams of Dazol . You 're gonna be OK , baby , we 're gonna put you back to sleep . It 's gonna be all right . I promise it 's gonna be okay . Multiple compound radial and ulnar fractures to the right arm . - Severed brachial artery . - Right arm 's a shredder , we 're looking at complete A-K amputation of both legs . There were vascular damages . Catastrophic . - Loss of f≈ìtal heartbeat . - Dr. Anthros . EP 's falling . 80 systolic . - Prep her . - Dr. Anthros ! Do it ! Why didn 't somebody stop him ? He has full clearance , we didn 't have the authority to stop him . That 's the price you pay for working with a so called genius . 'Cause he must have left his IQ in the car . Debreeding the ulnar nerve . Significant damage . Should I intervene ? No . This operation 's patient doesn 't officially exist . We have deniability , it 's a freebie . We can always terminate later if need be . Meanwhile , get Jae . It will have to be resected to its branch point . Radial nerve appears to be intact . Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned . The doctor . Did you kill him ? It was like a ride at Disneyland . Which one ? I 've never been . I 'll take you . You 'll love it . It 's all fat people , fat children walking around aimlessly , too stupid to know the difference . Do you miss it ? The way things were . If I could remember , I 'm sure I would . Do I remind you of her ? Your skin . Tell me you love me . Jaime . What happened ? There was an accident . You 're okay . My baby ... What about the baby ? Oh God ! There was no permanent damage . You 'll be able to get pregnant again . Why can 't I feel my legs . Okay , Jaime , I need to tell you something . What 's happening to me ? I need to tell you about what I had to do . - You need to listen . - I can 't feel my arm ! Listen to me , Jaime . Both your legs , and your arm had to be replaced . Also , your right ear and right eye . Molecular machines . Anthrocytes ... have been substituting for one eighth of your blood cells . Now , you should have lacerations bone-deep all over your face . But the anthrocytes are healing you . At an exponential rate . All of you . We 're making you better . It was a dream . The bionics enhance baseline human strength . And then some . What have you done to me ? - Why did you do this to me ? - You were going to die . Sir ! Born Jaime Wells Sommers . Van Horn , Iowa . February 23rd , 1983 . Mother deceased , cancer . She 's clean except for a sealed court record from 1998 . What 's in it ? - It 's sealed . - Unseal it . I 'm working on it . I think she 's a good candidate . Let 's pretend I 'm solliciting opinions . Why ? She 's stable . I pulled up an old Minnesota multi-phasic personality inventory . I liked what I saw . Plus the situation with her sister shows loyalty . And she 's smart . I found an old IQ test . How did she do ? A little better than you . Sir . Jae , can you train her ? Well , the last one we screened , tested , and there was psycho evaluation , and she was a soldier . Look where it got us . We always talked about non military applications . - Here 's our chance . - Your opinion is invalid here , you 're too close to the subject . This from the guy who played house with the last one . Let 's get fresh data . I want you to sit her down . All right . Yeah , I once had a wolf . A wolf only makes a good pet if it thinks it 's a dog . Your girlfriend ... We 're keeping her here against her will . How long until she realizes that no one can make her do anything against her will ? You 're talking about killing a human . I 'm talking about killing a wolf . You know what scares me about you ? Your father . He seemed normal , too . If I 'm anything like my father , you just made a big mistake . All right , we have to get you to rehab . - What for ? - Rehabilitation . I am not the one performing human experiments , and keeping people prisoner . You rehabilitate yourself . - I 'm Ruth . - I 'm pissed . Good . We 're here to talk about our feelings . How do you feel about me being kept here against my will ? I was speaking editorially . Actually , we 're here to talk about your feelings . Something no one seems to have any regard for . Curve balls will do that . You can have all the contingency plans you like , and then someone goes and does something like this , - and we all have to stay after school . - And talk about our feelings . - Your feelings . - Right . After all , feelings are what got us here in the first place . You like to draw . - True or false ... - I have a sister . She 's staying with your landlady . She thinks you 're skying in Vail . This is where you stayed . It looks nice . " We had fun . " Except for the part where ... " Will injured his arm skying into a tree . " Does this mean I 'll be going home at some point ? It means that we have a contingency plan , should you be going home at some point . We also have a plan , should you not . True or false . " You can 't teach an old dog new tricks " . You would have done the same thing . You never met my wife , did you ? For two years , I watched her die in the hospital while they disassembled her . And the whole time , I knew all I had to do to save her was bringing her here , but saving my wife was not the mission . Ruth says she 's stable . How long until she 's combat-ready ? She 's a civilian . Everyone has to sing for their supper around here , haven 't you figured that out yet ? How long until the rest of her implants come online ? - She likes to draw . - I don 't care . I think you 'll care about this . Who did they bury ? I mean , did you ever see the body ? You showed this to anybody else ? - Just you . - Keep it that way . General alert ! General Alert ! I can 't protect you in here . - We want you on the outside . - Why should I trust you ? 'Cause I 'm the only one you can trust . Go back to your life like none of this ever happened , - I 'll worlk it out with them . - What about you ? Go . Now ! All right , I 'll have those faxed over to you by Friday afternoon , and we 're still on for that meeting tomorrow ? Okay , good . Yeah . Mommy ! There 's a lady out there running really fast . Like as fast as a car ! Sweetie , what did I tell you about making things up ? I just thought it was cool that a girl could do that , that 's all . Let her go . - What the hell did you do ? - You won , all right ? For the program ... I 'll make her understand what 's at stake . - Just let me have time ... - Time for what ? Letting her go is not a bad idea . If you want her loyalty , give her freedom . Or the illusion of freedom . All right . Everybody , stand down . - You 're making a mistake . - Listen to me . The accident wasn 't an accident . According to the autopsy , the driver 's neck was broken an hour before the crash . Which means somebody else was driving that car , and we need to find out who . Jaime . It 's Will . If you 're there , pick up the phone . I need to talk to you . Jaime , please . There are things I need to tell you about . Before they happen Nice of you to show up ! I 'm sorry . Now what for ? For leaving and not telling you first . How was skying ? It was fine . Dad used to always say " Don 't leave anything until it 's been denied " - Becca ! - Don 't lie to me , OK ! We both know you don 't ski . So , where were you ? I can 't tell you . - Coffee . - Sure . It 's no smoking . What are you ? A forest ranger ? Something like that . It must be scary . Alone in the forest . Just you , and animals . Not if they know who 's in charge . Wait up ! Guard ! We both know you 're working in a supermax prison a thousand feet below Florence . We both know this is a place where they stick people when they outlive their usefulness . - I don 't know who you are . - If you don 't do exactly what I say , my man 's gonna carve your wife Barbara a magnificent smile . Oh God , baby Help me . How did you do it ? Do you know what they call creatures that can live comfortably in environments considered lethal , say ... for instance ... a thousand feet below the Earth 's surface ? - How did you do it ? - Extremophiles . I 'll do an impression of one for you . Ready ? - How did you ... - What ? How did I do what ? Sarah Corvus is still alive . And you came all the way here to tell me that . Let me do another impression for you . Impression of a man who 's been stabbed in the back . Stripped of his rights , and thrown in a hole like a dog . Sarah Corvus is a time bomb . We both know it . Well , time bombs only matter to those who have time . Goodbye , Jae . Please give my regards to Will . Tell him Daddy says hello . Guards ! If I may make an observation , you seem way too innocent and sweet to be behind a bar . You should be out there with the rest of ' em . Finally . I 'm not the only person who feels that way . - What can I get you ? - Beer . On the house . Thank you . Don 't I know you ? We met very briefly . We didn 't even actually meet . - Where ? - Guess . Are you all right ? - Yeah . - Let me take a look at it . It 's okay . Are you okay ? Come on . Your husband will never know . Please . Are you all right ? Let me help you . Juste breathe . It 's like that . The first time the ear and eye implants come online . It 's too much information . You have to learn how to focus it . And turn it off and on at will . You 're a fast healer . The anthrocytes are doing their job . Who are you ? Who are you ? Jaime ! Tell everyone Sarah Corvus says hello . Yo ! Lookin ' for somethin ' ? You need somethin ' ? Come here , baby . I got what you need . Please . Please don 't . Don 't ... - Are you okay ? - Tell me what you put in my head . I almost killed a man , I didn 't even know what I was doing . What did you put in my head ? Microscopic chips have been implanted in your cerebral cortex . My father ... He developed the technology for the military . The program was meant to help amputees in the Gulf . Of course , he saw the combat applications immediately . You made me into a soldier ! You 're hard wired for highly specialized warfare , yes . - I was gonna kill him . I would 've . - You didn 't , you 're still in control , - and with the proper training ... - Training ? ! We 're the only ones that can protect you . Let me protect you . How can you protect me if you 're scared of me ? I never meant for any of this to touch you , I didn 't , I just ... I couldn 't bear to loose you . That isn 't even me . Yes . It is . Hey ! Hey . I have to get back to Becca . Can 't keep leaving her like this . What do you people do anyway ? It 's complicated . Try me . The world 's further along than anyone wants to admit . Technology is at the point where science fiction isn 't fiction any more . We keep that technology from getting into the wrong hands . Who gets to decide right from wrong ? What about Sarah Corvus ? - Where does she figure in all this ? - Where did you hear that name ? Where did you hear that name , Jaime ? Will ! - I 'm ... sorry . - Just hold on , okay ? Where is she ? I need everyone . Time out ! The anthrocytes in our blood can filter out any impurities in our lungs . Fringe benefits of being a freak . What do you want from me ? Honestly , I 'm not sure . Jogging partner ? Who are you ? Without being too melodramatic about the whole thing , I 'm Sarah Corvus . The first bionic woman . So , what did they replace ? I figured the eyes and the ears . What else ? Me , they did both arms , both legs . Only one eye . Anthros wasn 't sure about the optical interface . So I did the other one myself . Part of my chest , too . I 'm cutting away all the parts of me that are weak . Time in . You only have one bionic arm . You should really do something about that . You gotta have to do a little better than that . How am I doing now ? Not bad . Not bad at all . We have a 39 year old male caucasian , gunshot victim to left shoulder . Request assistance from Mercy General . Will gonna make it ? Miss Sommers ! Just wanted to get a look at you . Who are you ? We have 50 million $ worth of my property inside you so I guess you could say I 'm your landlord . What do you want from me ? I don 't know . Maybe you died 3 days ago , and you haven 't realized it yet . - Is that a threat ? - There are no free agents here . Sooner or later , you 'll have to make a choice . It goes something like this . Heads , you loose . Tails , you die . Welcome in the game . If we do this ... whatever this is . We do it on my terms . If that 's not okay with you ... I know what I 'm capable of now . So you send whoever you send . And I 'll bury one guy after the next . You understand me ? By the way . Sarah Corvus says hello . Tell Jae we have a candidate . What are you doing ? I haven 't seen the moon in a thousand and twenty three days . It hasn 't changed . Let 's go . We have work to do . Transcript Synchro : Herb Resynchro : IceFre @ k

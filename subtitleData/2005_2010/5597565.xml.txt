 Show it to me , Ilbren . Be warned . This was made for Trevor 's viewing pleasure only . Roll it . I 'm here on a schedule , not for pleasure . Trevor , how could you ? What 's your interest in this creature ? That 's my business . Just get her for me . Oh , I see . You and she , in ecstatic nest-feathering . - You disgust me . - I don 't care what you think . It 's all here as agreed , half now ... the rest when you bring her to me . This isn 't what I asked for , Ilbren . All I see here is a lot of money . Now hold on one moment , this is exactly ... I don 't have a record of what we said . - Do you ? - Of course not . All right , these are the new terms . You ! I 've no use for your anarchic idiocy . Very pretty . - Are you really in love with it ? - Yes , with her . That 's a shame . I can 't take your assignment . What ? She 's not in love with you , I can promise you that . We can do business , Aeon . There is another Seraph-Trev ... - Didn 't I just say ... - It 's male . As beautiful as the first and untouched . Possibly neglected . You know Trevor 's tastes . - I thought I did . - What do you say , Aeon ? - Are you with me ? - It doesn 't want you , Ilbren . Who does ? I 'd sooner kill it than give it to you . Stay away , Aeon . She 's mine . Mr. Chairman , her intelligence index has just been re-evaluated ... it 's way into the red . Sir , don 't you think we should send a detail after her ? I mean , not to be presumptuous ... but with the trail being fresh and so on ... I suppose . What 's the point ? Better we don 't , we 'll close her down , whatever . Hey , come on ! Oh , no ! Go away . I 'm busy . Pay attention , girl . Your services are being commandeered ... by a directive under Monican enforcer aegis 71225 . Monican enforcer aegis , that was good . Can I steal that ? I 've been looking for that jacket . I took it to mean you were coming back . Sorry this place is such a mess . - Same old routine ? - Same old missed opportunities . I 'm hesitant . Like today , a boy wounded this bird and ... Don 't have time . This really is a priority and you are being conscripted , Una . Translate this by tomorrow morning . I really want to help , Aeon , you know I do ... but the bird 's badly hurt and I think I should ... You 've been living on frozen eel sticks and you 're tending a pet ? Una ! How 's this ? If I help your feathered friend rally ... - think I can get an all-nighter out of you ? - Yes , sure . Can you , really ? There . You 'll have to scrounge up bird juice and bandages ... but that should cut down the shock . Now get cracking . I 'll be back in the morning . Aeon ... you 're forgetting your jacket again . I tell myself they want for nothing . Their every need met . They can 't complain , they have it all . The intelligence quotient survey at 10 , the full benefit plan at 20 . Every one of them touched by the consequences of my leadership . But I am not touched . So , the only solace is the self-denying bliss ... to be found in the wings of the Seraph-Trev . Damn ! Come on , where is it ? A match made in heaven . You see , Trevor , you 're the odd man out . Oh , no ! This appears to be in Scaloti Middle-High Breen . Someone didn 't want someone to read this . Nerik ! Don 't you know how to knock ? Una . Nerik , I don 't have time . I must finish this , I 'm way behind . What is it with you , Una ? You 've been preoccupied all quarter . We hardly see each other anymore . - Why ... - Can we have this discussion ... - some other time ? - Who is he , Una ? I know what it is . It 's that really weird girl ... who 's always coming over with her priority translations . I know you . You always had a thing for foreign tongues . Right , Nerik ... we 've been toppling governments behind your back for years . She comes over , and we bake chocolate bombs . Look , Una , I 've got to know , do you still love me ? Nerik , I really don 't think I have time for you . There 's something more ... I ... I want my Shattered Fixtures cassette back by Wednesday . I 'll pick up my fish next week . Why don 't you take them now ? Aeon ! I ... I 'm gonna need a little time to work on ... Starting the assignment I gave you ? - But you 've got time to jumpstart Nabob . - Nerik . It 's not what you think . He was just here a minute . - We broke ... - Look ... you spent my time wet-nursing Nerik ... and now I 'm up against the wall without a clue . - You were with me on this , Una . - I am . I 'd never let you down . Just give me a chance to redeem . Too late for that . Looks like we 're going to be improvising in the field . We ? Una , haven 't you translated my fish yet ? You 'll never get those slingshots finished at this rate . - Here 's our exit . - What ? It 's you , Number 3 . Don 't you have enough thoughts to suppress ? Sir , it 's Aeon Flux . Her ! I told you not to bother me with that nonsense . But we set the trail as you ordered , sir . We believe she has the missing documents . What are you talking about ? The location of the Seraph-Trevs ... Sir ... Chairman Goodchild ? Quarantine Isthmus Crypticus' chamber at once . - Zero tolerance control ! - Yes , sir . - Good work , Number 3 . - Thank you , Chairman . And when you 're done , go shoot yourself . Yes , sir . That 's right , kill the damn messenger . All right , make this an impeccable rush job . Green light , go . Red light , stop . Green light , stop . Red light , go ! Take subsection C , about 15 yards , then make a sharp right . My mistake . Actually , you want to take a left . Sorry , under the gun and all . Only went over Scaloti briefly . Did so-so on it ... Kill the transcript updates . Be as accurate as possible . Help me , Una . Take the left down subsection C , then take the southwest corridor . It should plug into one of the lower branches . I mean , the southeast corridor should plug into lower neglected personage . I mean " passage . " How close are you to getting your degree ? Just take the southeast corridor and that should ... You should be able to see a red door to your right ... with a green frame . No , it can 't be . - It can 't . - Una . Una , are you there ? Do you copy ? Come in , Una . Aeon , I have some new coordinates for you . Yes , these are definitely the ones you need . Proceed as follows . Aeon , Una here , you copy ? You should be directly over the male Seraph-Trev 's chamber . Can you see the fold-out stairs yet ? Over . I 'm almost there . Green light , go . Red light , stop . Green light , stop . Red light , go ! Please don 't be afraid . My name 's Ilbren Lanz . I 'm here to save you . You 'll never have to wear blindfolds again . I 'll even give you back your wings . You have to trust me . Not a dream . If it is , don 't ever let it stop . Una , no ! That lascivious , impulsive , irresponsible ... jealous ... He 's mine ! He always was . The bird came to me , not you . He sent it . You knew ! I worshiped you and you used me ! You 're out of control , Una . Now drop the gun and let 's talk . To hell with this . Even if our friendship 's finished , this much we have to get straight . I couldn 't have known we were on the same trail . A Breen named Ilbren offered me the male ... if I kidnapped the female for him . You 'd do anything ! But we 're not going to do that . This creature is in agony . You 've helped me come this far , so help me finish . Don 't be afraid . I used to be a familiar of the demon lover who blinded and grounded you . But I 've just given myself a generous promotion . - Don 't stop me , Aeon . He wants me ! - No , he isn 't for you . No ! Go on . Go to him . Take him away . No . Stop , it 's dangerous . No , Aeon ! You don 't know what you 're doing . You had no right . - She didn 't deserve this . - Nice wings . Go to hell . Will you fly me there ? You know , some people are never meant to be together .

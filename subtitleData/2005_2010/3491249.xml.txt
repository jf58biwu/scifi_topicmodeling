Or someone else 's legs . Something always goes wrong . I 'm not building my hopes up . And we begin . Have you found any dirt on her yet ? - Her character is flawless , sir . - Damn ! And if her character is flawless , that means ... - I know . I 'll have to frame her . - No , sir ! I mean ... Is working . Now if calculation 's correct , portal should open now . It 's working ! Something is not right . It 's saying we don 't exist . How can this be possible ? Taking us to nearest valid reality . Makes no sense . - What size is this ? - This baby is 50 inches of full crotch throbbing pixel power . - I like it . - Too big , Is anything for the bedroom ? - I don 't know how much long I ... - ... It 's crazy . - What about this one ? - I don 't know how much longer .. Yes , something is real . Send Rimmer to first see it 's safe . - What ? - Wait ! I said waaaaaaait ! - What was that ? - Did you hear something smash ? - On TV . I don 't know how much longer ( ? ) - Was it HTV ? ( ? ) - Yes , a submersion of HTV . ( ? ) - Where are we , Kryten ? - Well , according to the Psi-scan , sir , we 're in a department store in London - ... in the early part of the 21st century . - Early part of the 21st ... Isn 't that when all the banks went belly up and money became useless ? I 've read about that in history . What a sound system , eh ? Sounds like you 're in the room , with them . - Red Dwarf . There 's a new series ? I don 't really follow it myself . Science-fiction . It 's a little bit bollocks really , isn 't it ? That Psi-scan thing . Knows everything , doesn 't it ? Any bit of exposition , just ask the Psi-scan . How can it know everything ? Talk about rubbish . - Who 's he , crack ? Well , according to the Psi-scan , sir , he 's a pompous know-all know-nothing idiot called Mike Mellington . - Coincidentally has a very small penis . - How does a Psi-scan know that ? - Well it scanned his e-mail , sir . He 's already onto his 4th tub of penis enlargement cream . Hey buds , the photo 's closed . We can 't get back ! What do you mean get back ? We are back ! This is it . This is home ! And we got rid of Kremlin Kate , let 's crack open the vodka . - Is it me or is everyone staring ? Also , they all seem to be in smirk mode , sir . They 're just laughing at your face , Kryten . Nothing to worry about . Back in the 21st century , they laughed at freaks all the time . They used to have TV shows on saturday night , where they gathered all the freaks , make them sing and dance , then point and laugh at them . Simple people , simple tastes . Hey , Hey ! What are these things ? They 're digital versatile discs , sir . DVDs for short . They were very popular at the beginning of 21st century , before they died out and were replaced by what we use now . - Well , you mean videos . - Precisely . Back then no one knew , that the human race were utterly incapable of putting the DVDs back in their cases . You can see the point . Over two trillion went missing in just over 20 years . Videos are just too big to lose . Sirs , look ! Red Dwarf ! This is us ! It 's a TV series about us . It recounts all our adventures . Every single one of them . How 's this possible ? Wait , we 're characters from a TV series who somehow escaped the TV well into the real world . That explains why the dimension cutter said our reality wasn 't valid . I 'm not real ! I 'm a character in a TV series . I 'm not real ? That explains so much I 'm not real either ? Does that mean I 'm not really this good looking ? Just typical of my luck , isn 't it . Just when things start to right it turns out that I 'm ... I 'm not real . Fantastic ! But now , sirs . We need clear heads and equinimity . Naturally , it 's extremely disturbing to discover that we are just characters in a TV series . And naturally there 's going to be a period of climatisation . But it 's essential But it 's essential that we keep all this in perspective . We 're not real ! What are we gonna do ? There ! I think that 's pretty much put in perspective , don 't you think ? This is too weird for words . Hey guys , look at this ! Back to Earth . That 's the story we 're in now . He 's right , look ! There 's no disc in it . Coming soon , it 's not out yet . Back to Earth . Takes place after series X. Kochanski 's dead and the crew are held through a portal to discover they 're just characters in a TV series . Knowing they will die in the final episode - Die ? the dwarfs in a best Blade Runner tradition track down their creators to plead for more life . How are we gonna do that ? Easy ! Hey buds , give us more life , I 'm pleading with you ! See ? First the crew attempt to track down the actors that play them in the series and their metaphysical odyssey begins . All my life I wanted to go on a metaphysical odyssey ! For years ! I never thought I 'd get the chance ! - So what happens next ? - It says it 's a three-parter . No , not a three-parter ! I hate three-parters ! What if I 'm not in that night ? Saying I 'm busy . What if ? Oh , tell you what . Toilets here are medieval . - Bet you felt right at home . There 's no toilet paper . They don 't use it in these days . - Like I said , they were simple people . - They eat spam . - I mean there I am - in the cubicle , no paper wondering what to do . I open the door and see this machine on the wall which blows out hot air . Then a twig ! - Tell you what , they got a different system here . - Different system ? Yeah , well , you gotta wash yourself in the sinks . And use the air machine to dry your bum . - And that 's what you did ? - No choice . And those air machines are really hot . It 's like you 're holding your cheeks apart , jumping up and down trying to catch a breeze . I 'll tell you something , they 're not friendly around here . Trying to start a conversation - not once , no . Where 's Cat and Kryten ? They went to get some money . Haven 't got to be between us . Money ? How they 're gonna get money ? Some second hand shop . Kryten 's gonna try and pone ( ? ) his head . - And what about seeing ? He can use his spare set of eyes . Hanging out of his neckhole . Well that 's a good look , isn 't it ? That 's not gonna stand out at all ! - Hey ! - Any luck ? They thought we were from a hidden camera show , sir ! and wouldn 't take us seriously . We even offered to throw in one of his legs . Still no deal . How are we gonna trace our creators ? We ain 't got no wheels , ain 't got no do . Money . I know how we can get money . How much we got ? We 've got 15 combs , 2 mobile phones , 3 packets of gum , 2 condoms , 2 pairs of reading glasses and 19 pieces of popcorn . I 'm expecting to pull out Glenn Miller or Shurgar ( ? ) anytime . - What about the money ? So far we got 19 pounds and 43 pence . - Now what ? Well , according to this , we get on the tube and we go to a science fiction club called They walk among us . This is too weird for words . Hey buds , check this ! Look , that 's me ! Look at that ! And that ! - Listening to music ? - No . Why ? I was just wondering if you could help us . We 're trying to find the guys involved in the making of the TV series called Red Dwarf . We 're trying to find out if our show , well , this is weird - we 're not the actors . We 're the real characters . There was this kinda dimension thing .. Dimension skid , was it ? Happens a lot this time of year . One minute you 're fine , the next you 're in a new dimension . Gotta be so careful . Thank god for that . He 's insane . So you have to have the cast info ?

Go on , guess ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Oh ? No ! No ! Should I tell you ? No . No . Should I tell you ? I 'm gonna tell you anyway . I 've got standing in my shop the real actual crew from Red Dwarf . Had a bit of a dimension skid . Yeah , that 's what I said . Well , they 're trying to find out how many shows they 've got left . Exactly . Need some numbers , know you 've got ' em . What ? Why ? Can 't give out cast info . Space code directive 596 . 596 ? Love it , when he does this and gets it all wrong . 596 ? Spacecode superchimps before made active decency in zero gravity will lose all banana privileges No , Sir . The crew 's files are for the captain only . So we 're smegged . - What 's that ? - That 's Dave Lister 's bath from season IX . Best season ever if you ask me . Awesome season . Best by miles . You were in that , remember , when Kryten ran in and told you that Kochanski had been sucked out of an air lock . Fish scale ? Not fish ! Could be a bit of poppadom . Who doesn 't need a curry in the bath ? Maybe it 's artificial snake scale from the one Polymorph turned into . Kryten ? It 's got a licence number and a props maker 's name - Swallow . I 've seen that name here . Hey , here it is . Swallow Cast , waiting for taxis fan convention 2009 Kryten , scan the photo and beam it onto that TV . Uncrop . Wait , what 's that ? - Frame left .

Oh sir , wouldn 't it have been quicker to look him up in the phonebook ? Print me a 4 by 6 and any more remarks like that I 'll ask for an A3 out of your waste disposal . Makes latex masks for the film and TV industry . Specializing in noses . Maybe if we track him down he 'll point us in the right direction . But sir , how are we gonna get there ? That 's over 30 miles away . - I know . Hollyhop drive . - Back on Red Dwarf . - Metapuddle . - Back on Red Dwarf . Time slides , when you walk into a photograph and ... - Back on Red Dwarf . - Got it ! Beam there ! - That 's Star Trek , not us ! We don 't do that , sir . All right , if you 've got no teleportation systems or any material reassemblers , no option 's left - you have to catch the bus . Neurotic ? I 'm not neurotic ! I 've never been neurotic ! Neurotic ? Neurotic ? Are they insane ? Who writes this stuff ? I wasn 't even neurotic when I was a kid . Didn 't have time , I was too busy washing my hands Hilarious . In what way am I hilarious ? Name one way in which I 'm hilarious . Just one , one way . Well you 're pompous without reason , sir , and you have hilariously unrealistic life goals . Well , I 'm lord of the star fleet , Kryten and you 'll pay for that remark . Four for Blabla Street , bla bla please . Hilariously unrealistic life goals . That 's true . That 's so true .

Cool ? - You don 't take any smeg , that 's cool . - And even though you 're disgusting , sometimes you 're quite brave . Are you sad about Kochanski ? We were sad too . So is dad . Then we worked it out . What ? What out ? She is not really dead . Kryten was the only one to see her die , right ? See her get sucked out the air lock . - But she didn 't . - She didn 't ? - Kryten made it up . - Why would he do that ? - You were a mess , falling apart . - Drinking , being deaf ( ? ) . - She couldn 't bear to stand and watch you die . And you wouldn 't listen . So she took the blue midget and acted it . Why would Kryten lie to me ? She was only trying to save your feelings . So you wouldn 't feel like a big fat loser . You 've been dumped . I was dumped once . It was really horrible . Dumped ? But that would mean , that would mean she was still alive . She is still alive , I bet you ! She 's really good at guessing stuff . That DVD - Titanic she knew that ship would sink right from the start . She could tell . Even in that bible film . She said : Jesus - he 's not dead .

 In the future , my son will lead mankind in a war against Skynet , a computer system programmed to destroy the world . It has sent machines back through time ... some to kill him ... one to protect him . Today we fight to stop Skynet from ever being created . To change our future . To change his fate . The war to save mankind begins now . Season 1 Episode 5 Queen 's Gambit ( v. 1.00 ) Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ... He 's here . Are you forgetting that I blew his head off ? - He came through . He knows we 're here . - It 's just a head . We 're programmed to repair ourselves . We 're programmed to blend in . - There are other people here . - Resistance fighters . Humans sent back from the future by John . Who have money and guns . Jumper outside the gym ! It 's my new friend . - The crying one . - We gotta help her ! No . I need you to look at these photographs . Tell me if you recognize anybody . The young one . His name is Andrew Goode . He was an intern at Cyberdyne one summer . Do you wanna have dinner with me ? My turk plays chess at at level that could defeat every human player that 's ever lived , - and probably ever will live . - You talk about it like it 's human . You never know . Andy Goode must be killed . Of all the training my son received in the jungles of Central America , nothing prepared him better for combat than the game of chess . It taught him almost everything he needed to know about war . That to win you must be patient , bold , calculating , and most of all ... willing to sacrifice . Andy . Haven 't heard from you in a while . Sorry I 've been out of touch . But after the fire in my house ... How can I explain ? It was kind of a blessing . - Can you meet me ? - Where are you ? A hotel in Pasadena . I 'm checking into a tournament . A tournament ? Yeah , you know , chess . Charley Dixon ? Agent Kester , FBI . - I need to ask you a few questions . - What is this about ? Sarah Connor . Are you really good at math ? Yes . You wanna do mine ? Yes . We got a problem . Andy Goode rebuilt his chess computer . The Turk . - But you napalmed it . - Apparently he spent every minute since then in a coffee shop in Van Nuys rewriting the code from memory . A good code is like a song in your head . It 's gotta come out . The song might just blow up the world . You should have killed him when you had the chance . And I 'm surprised it 's taken you this long to bring that up . I 'm doing John 's homework . Andy entered it into a tournament . - Computer versus human ? - Computer versus computer . It 's the new thing . These programs are too smart and powerful to play people anymore . It gets better the more we talk about it . You 're going to school . You and Tin miss can meet me there later . You don 't know anything about chess . I know a little bit about Andy . Besides , you can 't be absent . Absent gets you on the radar . Okay , I get it . You go . Can I have some money for lunch ? Isn 't this awesome ? God , I love robots . Come here . - So is this one better or worse ? - Well , it 's different , really . More adaptable , but less predictable . Not as powerful for now , but quicker on its feet . It has a hunger for learning , - but sometimes the lessons it learns ... - Sounds more human . Well , if you want an analogy , I 'd say that Turk I had grown into a brooding teenager , and Turk II is still more of a precocious child . Speaking of brooding and precocious , this is my partner , Dimitri Shipkov . I built the Turk , but Dimitri taught it to play chess . She 'll never sleep with you . Da , poka . - You should plug that in . - Yep . Don 't listen to him . He 's just worked up about the military contract . We have a deal to split the money . What military contract ? The one the winner gets . Why don 't you get your story straight ? Is she dead or isn 't she ? Sarah Connor survived the explosion in the bank vault . So did her son . Yeah , that was eight years ago . You guys just figured that out ? Yes . Yes ? Yes , what ? We just figured that out . Babe , who was that at the door ? Good morning , ma 'am . He 's from the FBI . I 'm asking a few questions . - Charley , is something wrong ? - No . - I 'm looking for the Connors . - Sarah Connor ? Your ex ? - I 'm looking for them here . - Here ? Mr. Dixon wanted to marry Sarah Connor before you . She 's alive . Maybe he 's hiding her here . What ? I already told you , no . No , okay ? Look , all due respect , Agent Kester , the woman that I knew , Sarah Reese , she blew herself up in a bank eight years ago . I never knew , and I do not know Sarah Connor . If you see or hear anything , call me . Any time , I never sleep . Just a reminder , grief counseling will be available in my office throughout the week . - What are they doing ? - They 're writing notes . For Jordan . She 's dead . Yeah , I remember watching her fall . Me too . How will she get the notes ? She won 't . But you said ... Sometimes things happen and they 're so bad , people don 't know how to deal with their sadness . They write it in a note . But I thought people cried when they were sad . Sometimes it 's not enough . Are you gonna ... ? I didn 't really know her . I didn 't either . I like the note part . Nice accent , white boy . I have no idea what 's with those guys . They 're always messing with me . Yeah , man , I 've no idea . I 'm Morris . John . I saw you talking to Cheryl Weston this morning . Maybe no one told you cause you 're new but she 's damaged goods . She 's my chem partner . - Do you know her or something ? - No one knows her . Something crazy went on at the last school she was in , but no one knows what it is . Her dad 's got her locked down tight . It 's a pretty boring rumor . It 's truth . Not much of it . I 'm just looking out for you , bro . Yeah , you and everyone else . An extremely close match between the American and Japanese computers here in the finals . The Americans , led by programmer Andrew Goode , have a slight positional advantage . The Japanese seize control of the center with bishop to C5 . Do you know how many grand masters are here ? How 's Andy doing ? Well , that depends on what your plans are for Andy . On the one hand , he 's in the final round , on the other hand ... the winner gets a military contract . Military ? Are you serious ? What do we do ? Cheer very hard for the Japanese or Cameron will kill him . An unorthodox move by the Japanese , leaving their queen hanging on D6 square . The American computer calculating a response . - What just happened ? - That bishop on C5 totally hammered him . Black 's in total zugzwang . Translation ? The Japanese just lost their queen . They 're in big trouble . Andy 's gonna win . So that was quite a speech earlier . With the agent . That wasn 't a speech , it 's was just ... it 's just what it was . What it was , was a lie . What ? A lie . You have a tell . A what ? A tell ? You have a tell . When you lie . Do you know why you love me , Charley ? I 'm gonna tell you why you love me . It 's cause I 'm not that girl . I 'm not that jealous girl . I 'm not that insecure girl . I 'm not that petty girl . - Of course not . - Yeah , so just don 't make me into that girl by lying to me . If that woman is alive , if you 've seen her ... this is important . I saw John . What ? Where ? Here . In our house . In our house ? In our house ? What did he want ? I don 't know . I think he just wanted to see me . What are you gonna do about it ? I don 't know . They 're fugitives , Charlie . They 're dangerous people . Sarah 's not dangerous . Maybe not the Sarah you knew . Sarah Reese , but Sarah Connor killed a man . - We don 't know that . - Well , what do we know ? What do you know ? The Japanese desperately hoping for counterplay after the disastrous loss of their queen . Victory appears imminent for the Americans . Andy Goode 's Turk seized control of the match in the middle game , and now appears just moves away from winning . Rook to C2 . Checkmate . A shocking turn of events . The Japanese team has won the tournament and the military contract . It 's over . - Andy lost . - But the other team ... They didn 't lose their queen , they sacrificed it . Just like Byrne-Fischer all over again . Byrne-Fischer , 1956 ? - Never mind . The point is ... - The Turk fell for a trap ? It 's like it just ... choked . So now , what ? - We go after them now ? - No , their names weren 't in the safe house . Andy 's was . What computational error ? You put the bishop on E6 to begin with ! I can 't help it if it 's stupid ! Nobody 's gonna want Andy 's program now . - That thing 's kind of crazy . - He could still be a threat . - It could still become Skynet . - It could also become Pong . What are you gonna do ? I don 't know . Maybe I 'll just sit Andy down and tell him everything . Andy . Who are you ? Put your hands above your head ! Do it now ! Turn ! Turn ! Spread ' em ! Put your hands behind your back . Over here . I 'm so sorry , Andy . What 's this ? You should write Andy a note if you can 't cry . Doesn 't bother you that he 's dead , does it ? The world is safer without him . That was way too easy . LAPD firewalls really blow . - Show me what you found . - Okay . No name , but he 's got this tattoo on his arm . He 's one of them . That 's a tattoo from a Skynet work camp . He 's a resistance fighter . From the future . Like the three guys in the safe house ? - He was the fourth . - Then you know him . - In the future . - So do you . He 's one of your best soldiers . They 've been watching Andy Goode . Doing surveillance . Same as us . Well , not exactly the same . - He actually killed the guy . - That was not his mission . You sent him here to wait for us . Well , then I guess he changed his mind . A lot . I have to talk to him . Talk to him ? How ? He 's in lockdown . Freeze . What are you doing ? Math . I already did your homework . Yeah , I know , but I still have to take the test . I need to know this stuff . Then why did you ask me to do it ? Because maybe it 's kinda hard to concentrate on geometry when people keep dying around you . You have no idea what I 'm talking about , do you ? You 're grieving . Grieving ? How do you know what grieving is ? I read all the notes . Cameron Baum , Mr. Harris wants to see you . I know this is difficult for you to talk about , so I 'm gonna need you to be strong . Okay ? - Can you do that for me ? - Yes . I can be strong . People say you were the last person to speak with Jordan before she ... Died . - Is that true ? - I don 't know . Are you asking me if people say I was the last person to talk to Jordan , or are you asking me if I was the last one to talk to her ? - I guess I 'm asking if you were . - I don 't know . What did she say when you did talk to her ? I mean , was it something upsetting for you to hear ? She said , " You saw it , right ? " Right ? You saw it ? It 's so freakin ' big and right out there . " She was talking about the graffiti ? It 's freakin ' big . Yes . Yes , it is . And no . No ? No , it wasn 't upsetting for me to hear it . Did Jordan mention any names ? Any specific people that she was upset with ? Her parents . - Anyone else ? - The hall monitors . Anyone else ? You ask that question a lot . Is there anything else you want to tell me ? I don 't think I told you anything . Can I go now ? I 'm done with grief counseling , and I feel much better . Yeah , please . Go . Yo , John Doe , you got a visitor . Those hurt ? Sometimes they crank those tight before they bring you in here . That way , you might ask me to loosen them up . And I am able to accommodate you in that . It 's a trick they do . It gives us a connection . But we already got a connection . Your prints are everywhere . Oven , light switch , toilet . Safe . Wasn 't us who found it . But somebody did . After the police thought they cleared the scene , somebody came back and emptied the safe right quick . Didn 't force it either . They knew the combination . So . We 've got you running from the scene of Andrew Goode 's murder . And we 've got you living at , and disappearing from , and most likely returning to the scene of these three murders . All of which would be a prosecutorial bounty . But I 've also got forensic evidence , linking this to this and this . Feeling connected yet ? What is it ? The forensic evidence linking all these people ... What is it ? Blood . Not my blood . No , not your blood . And , technically , not even blood . Some kind of synthetic . Come on , man , help me out . Tell me something I don 't know . We 're all gonna die . Yeah , I want him out of local custody today . He has more to say and I want him on federal turf when he says it . Yes , this is Cameron 's mother . Mrs. Baum , do you aware of the recent tragedy we 've had here at school ? - Jordan somebody . - Tallen . When I spoke to Cameron about it , she seemed strangely unaffected . I 'm sure you 're doing all you can as a parent . It 's been overwhelming for all of us , first with the tornado , - then the move . - Tornado ? I 'm sorry , she didn 't mention that . That might explain what I think - might be post-traumatic stress . - You 're gonna have to speak up . You shouldn 't be here . - I know who you are . - And I know who you are . Who else but Sarah Connor would have burned down that poor kid 's house ? It was you , wasn 't it ? On Andy 's porch that night . You 've been watching . You wanted to kill him , the poor kid , and you did . I didn 't do it . All I wanted was the Turk . Somebody else killed him and took the machine . What ? He was dead when I got there . He was dead and the Turk was gone , - and I hoped you 'd done it . - You thought I killed him ? But you 're here . And the Turk is out there . So we both failed . You gotta get out of here . If you haven 't figured it out , I have a T-888 on my ass . Now if you found me , it will too . - We should get you out . - Go . Find the partner , the Russian . He 's gotta be neck-deep in this also . - You 're dead in here . - Go ! Please . I won 't be the bastard who brings metal down on the Connors , so just go . You 're prettier than your picture . Picture ? Yeah , it 's actually how I clocked you . My brother carried your snap for luck . Who 's your brother ? What does it matter ? You don 't know the Reese boys , and you never will . Reese boys ? Derek Reese . Brother 's Kyle . When John sent Kyle Reese back to protect me , we had two days together . He told me about the future , about the apocalypse , and the terror of a world run by machines . Kyle reese saved my life . He gave me a son . He never told me that he had a brother . He never told me we would have family . That in our grief we are not alone . Cherry . - Cherry . - Walk away . John , please . Lock and key , bro . Lock and key . Mom 's here . Hi . I 'm Morris . Your brother 's new best friend . Cameron . Nice grip . Watch yourself . Just lookin ' out for ya . Field trip . I call shotgun . I call 9-millimeter . What 's the ETA on my prisoner ? All right . Drop it . Now . Run . You stay close . Take the jeep and follow us . You metal bitch . She 's on our side . T-888 . Lose him . - Let 's go . - Where 's Cameron ? - Leave her , let 's go . - Let 's go . Stay back ! Get out ! Bring me the toolbox . Switchblade . Pliers . We have to help him . - Don 't let it touch me . - We have to stop your bleeding . - Get away . - Don 't move . You 're increasing your blood loss . I can 't fix it . You took a bullet outta me . He has internal damage . He needs medical attention , or he 's gonna die . A stun gun . - Are you nuts ? - He needs a doctor . You 're gonna go out and kidnap one ? There 's an ER a mile away . It 's almost dark . Mom , this is crazy , all right . Even for you , it 's insane . - We have to save him . - And what happens when you get caught ? - We have to save him . - You don 't know who he is . He 's your uncle . He doesn 't know . He 's your father 's brother . His name 's Derek Reese . John . Two females , approximately 5 ' 6 " , 120 pounds , overpower you and your partner , ambush your secure vehicle , and kidnap my prisoner . That an accurate summation of what happened out here today , officer ? Yeah . 5 ' 6 " . 5 ' 6 " . If there is a flaw in chess as a game of war , it is this : unlike war , the rules of chess are constant . The pieces unchangeable . You will never win the heart of a rook or the mind of a knight . They are deaf to your arguments . And so be it . The goal of a chess game is total annihilation . But , in war , even as the blood beats in your ears and you race after your enemy , there is the hope that saner minds than yours will stop you before you reach your target . In war , unlike chess , rules can be changed . Truces can be called . The greatest of enemies can become the best of friends . Derek . Derek . He 's not breathing . Reese ! Reese ! In war , there is hope .

Risa Pears , a New York City school teacher and mother of an 18-month-old daughter flung herself in front of an oncoming train last night while returning home from the circus . Transcript : Yyets.net S01E17 : Bad Dreams I want permission to go to New York to investigate a case . What is it ? A suicide on the subway . I read about it in the paper , this morning . How exactly is this a case ? I believe that the woman may have been murdered . There may have been extraordinary circumstances . What kind of extraordinary circumstances ? I 'm listening . Uh ... That 's all I 'm comfortable saying at the moment , sir . Dunham , are you all right ? For the last few weeks , you 've seemed ... distracted . On edge . I haven 't been sleeping very well . I wouldn 't be asking if this wasn 't important . Dunham , you 're a crucial part of this operation . You 're very valuable to me . Thank you . 24 hours . Then I want you back on the job , head clear . Thank you . Olivia , it was a nightmare . It felt like I was really there . No , you were asleep in your bed . Wait a minute . Have you experienced any nausea , Agent Dunham ? Rashes , hair loss , even ... - a strand or two on the pillow ? - No . Any pain urinating , or blood ? I don 't think you 're helping . Is that a- - Yeah , a geiger counter . Not a rad . I thought you might have teleported to New York in your sleep and killed her . Wouldn 't that have been wondrous ? But even the most controlled matter to energy transmutation leaves behind some background radiation so ... Ergo , you are not actually there . Great , well , I 'm glad we got that cleared up . - Astral ... - Astrid . Projection . A spirit walk , as it were . No , no , no , you wouldn 't have had sufficient corporeal form to interact with the young woman . Here we go . It 's like listening to a broken record , but the lyrics keep on changing . She had a bad dream . No , I could smell the platform . I saw her baby staring at me . I saw her face before I saw the news . How is that possible ? Opium ? It wasn 't just a dream . Was it ? New York it is . I love New York . Oh ... We could catch a show ! Pippin ! Uh , ooh ... No ! # Cats fit on the window sill # - # Children fit in the snow # - Walter , you 're staying here . I 'll make it up to you . # Why do I feel like # # I don 't fit in anywhere I go ? # That is the Jackson Five , right ? Hmm ? Absolutely . She said to meet her at the clock . There she is . Uh , you the two ? Uh , Dunham , Bishop . FBI . You know , you shouldn 't eat those . About 30 years too late on that . Can you show us where this actually happens ? Yep . Let 's go . Are we safe ? Sorry ? FBI comes into my house . First thing I need to ask is , " Are we safe ? " I 'm not sure we 're ever really safe . We 're as safe as houses . What can you tell us about this suicide ? Just like it said in the papers ... Risa Pears , 28 ... Decided to take a header in front of the seven train . So what makes you think that it was a suicide ? Security cameras got it all . I 'd like to take a look at that tape myself . All right , we 'll set you up , Agent . What , exactly , are we looking for here ? Humor me . There 's gonna be a balloon floating on the ceiling . A red one . The husband was away on business in Seattle . He just flew back in . He 's giving a statement down at the station . Come on , this doesn 't fit the profile . Married , a baby . You don 't take your kid to the circus and give him a front-row seat to watch you kill yourself . And then there 's that . Yeah . This doesn 't make any sense . Uh-uh , she 'd been waiting to go to the circus . And she 's from here . We met in Chicago . I mean , she kept saying that she wanted ... to take Lucy to the circus . Okay ? She used to sing you this song about elephants . We were happy . She wouldn 't kill herself . You 've gotta believe me . She would never kill herself . Agent ? The surveillance you wanted is ready . Thank you . Sh--she wouldn 't do it . She just wouldn 't . - Thank you . - Mm-hmm . This is the digital backup . The primary drive is in evidence . Can you slow this down ? - Just start at the top . - Mmm-hmn . Can I get a copy of this ? See , it doesn 't make any sense . I remember things from the crime scene . I remember pushing her . You know dreams aren 't always literal . Perhaps you killed this young woman ... in some less-direct way . No , no , no , no , no , no . We just watched her kill herself . Perhaps you compelled her to jump using your mind . Do you have any reason to want her dead ? Romantic rival , perhaps ? What ? I didn 't even know her . - Then why did you kill her ? - I don 't know . Stop , both of you . Stop . Nobody killed anybody . I 'm surprised at you , Peter . Agent Dunham is your friend . You trust her . She says she killed that girl . Are you so presumptuous to believe her only when she says what you want to hear ? Your mother was a bit like that . Consider this question . What is mankind 's oldest dream ? - World peace ? - Oh , hardly . It 's a social construct imposed by an awareness of our own mortality . Should have gone with " Great taste , less filling , " huh ? What is the greatest desire of the weak and the subjugated ? Of the man whose fire is stolen by an opponent whose only advantage is the luck of superior size . We 're stealing fire ? I think we 're cavemen in this story . Whose woman is wrenched away by brutality and force . Sexist cavemen at that . Simple . To kill with thought . To wish someone dead . To murder with the mind . Come on , that 's ridiculous . You 're right , I 'm sure . Unless , of course , it happens again . # We met on the veer # # It roam as the sidewalk can stray # # In the candlelight and wine # # her hand go and find # # No wonder my heart , lifts away # - # Don 't stop # - Why would you do that ? What ? Come on . Do you think it 's okay to just flirt with her like that ? Honey , honey , please . What is it ... I 'm not young enough ? Honey , is there something wrong ? - I 'm not sexy enough anymore ? - Honey , would you relax ? - What are you doing to me ? - Would you relax ? - What is the matter with you ? - You bastard ! - Just calm down . - You cheating bastard ! I can 't stand the way you 're looking at her . You cheating bastard ! Uhh ! Uhh ! Ahh ! Ahh ! Uh ! Charlie . Charlie , it 's me . Uh , there 's been a murder . I tried to kill him . I have a half-dozen witnesses ' statements say she stabbed her husband . Yeah , I was there . No . You were 300 miles away . Somehow , I 'm killing these people in my dreams . Hello . Uh , Agent Olivia Dunham . - This is Peter Bishop . - Hi . So what can you tell us , Doctor ? The , uh , damage was quite severe . Upper and lower intestines both shredded . She , um , essentially gutted him . He 's gonna die . That 's why they gave her permission to be here . So your name is Mouse ? Nickname . From college . I 'm quiet ... I guess . Maybe just ... tell us what you remember . We were at dinner . Tuesdays , we go out . We decided Italian . I don 't know what happened . I just ... It doesn 't make any sense . Billy 's devoted to me . Suddenly ... I knew he was gonna leave me . I was convinced of it . And I got so ... scared . I got so angry . How could I do this ? Maybe ... you didn 't mean to hurt him . I mean , maybe somebody made you do it . - Like , compelled you . - Agent Dunham ? I mean , did it--did it feel like there was someone else in your head making you stab him ? I tried to kill my husband , right ? - How-how is this happening to me ? - Agent Dunham . - Oh , God . - Okay ... Agent Dunham , I need to talk to you , right now . It wasn 't you . Olivia , what , exactly , do you think you 're doing ? I made her do it , Peter . You 're running on no sleep . And if I 'm right , caffeine pills . I faked my way through grad school , remember ? You need to calm down . You 're not thinking straight , and you 're not making any sense . Peter ... What is happening to me ? Hey ... - Woah ! We 're closed . - FBI . Great . Fun times . So what can you tell me about what happened here last night ? I got nothing new for you , FBI . Humor me . Sure . Middle of dinner , bitch gets up and stabs her husband . Bitch ? Really ? We got a problem here ? Problem ? Yeah , we got a problem . People rush out last night in the middle of dinner . No one pays . Today , I 'm out all of lunch hour . Oh , yeah , also , I 'm on the cover of the Post . Who was sitting here ? Lady , this isn 't the Palm . We don 't keep a seating chart . - Who was it ? - Whoa ! Whoa ! Was I there ? Was it me ? Agent Dunham . Just some guy . He comes in every now and then . Blond hair . He 's got a scar on his face . I know who that is . What the hell is wrong with you ? You think you can do whatever you want ? What are you , crazy ? I 'm gonna sue you guys . Olivia , stop . What 's going on ? That man that he described , I 've seen him before . What ? Where ? That 's a curious word . So it 's got nothing to do with going underwater ? No . " Unsub " stands for unidentified subject . Actually , it should more logically mean going above water . And still no . I certainly hope we find him . Who we looking for ? I think it 's after this . Remarkable . This is entirely new . What ? You 're talking about the coffee . Mm , yes . What is it ? - Cinnamon ? - Yes . It 's quite good . Delightful , really . There . Blond hair , a scar . And he was at both crime scenes . So he 's our link . Interesting . No , no , not the coffee . Although , I was wondering if we can- - Walter ? Please . Well ... You say he was at the table where you dreamt you were sitting ... And he was on the platform where you dreamt - you were standing . - Yes . And in your dreams you got many of the actual details correct . - Is that right ? - Yes . But you did not see him in your dreams . No , I didn 't . Well , perhaps that 's because you were him . As I said , dreams are not always literal . What if you weren 't dreaming about yourself ... You were dreaming about him ... Mr. Unsub ? So he 's the one that 's been doing these things to these people , not me ? That 's a possible explanation . But why would I be dreaming of him ? I mean , who is he ? Government armed forces database is online . Interpol and public health systems online . We can match a partial from the restaurant . To one off the guard rail at the subway station . Running facial recognition software . Agents . What , precisely , is going on here ? Sir- - An unsub that may be killing people with his thoughts while Olivia is watching in her dream . - Uh , by the way ... - Sir . I don 't think this machine works . - Agent Dunham . - We 've got a hit . Suspect 's name is Nick Wayne . Uh , former address is St. Jude 's Mental Hospital . Well , I 'm not going there . I have a lawsuit from a restaurant managed in New York . I have unauthorized allocation of agency time and resources . I have access of government databases for personal use . What 's going on ? Someone 's been coming into my dreams . And he 's either been making me kill people or ... He 's been killing people and making me watch . You know how this sounds ? These things ... these things that we see every day , these things that we investigate ... They 're happening to me . Dunham , you understand what kind of scrutiny we 're under ? You 're under ? If Sanford Harris weren 't in Washington ... I know . You can 't unofficially investigate a case where you 're the subject . I 'm sorry . Dunham , why didn 't you come to me ? I should have . But I didn 't want to sound crazy . So maybe ... Maybe it 's better if I just take some time off ... Just a few days to work this out . Maybe just take a short leave . I need to do this . Agent Francis , we have a status change . I 'm opening a new case . Subject 's name is Nick Wayne . Agent Dunham is on point . Please give her whatever assistance she needs . Thank you . Dunham . Take care of yourself . I will . You know , until this year , I 'd never actually been to a mental hospital . Learn to like new things . Maybe I never gave it enough thought ... What Walter went through . I only every saw it from my own perspective . His being crazy was something that he did to us . To my mother and me . It wasn 't something that happened to him . Well , you were young . Well , I 'm not young anymore . Must be a terrible thing to not be able to trust your own mind . Yeah . Hey ... Are you two the federal agents ? Uh , yes . Agent Olivia Dunham . This is Peter Bishop . Dr. Miller . Come with me . I remember Nick very well . He was already a residential patient when I arrived here , which is about five years ago now . He had a very comprehensive insurance policy . Quite old . I 'd never seen one like it . - What kind ? - Military . About four months ago , an attorny arrived here with a paper saying that Nick had inherited a large sum of money . They met twice more , and after that , Nick checked himself out . He was here voluntarily , after all . Nick was an interesting person . He had a kind of brightness to him . Intelligent . Yes , quite , but not what I mean . He had an emotional brightness . If he was happy , he would light up a room . Sad , he was like a black hole that would suck you right down with him . Hyper-emotive is the clinical term . Put simply , his affect was highly infectious . - Was he dangerous ? - No . No , if anything , his ideation tended toward self-contempt . Toward the suicidal . Although he did suffer from some psychosis when his delusions were florid . What sort of delusions ? Typical paranoid fare . Nick was convinced he 'd been recruited as a child for a series of top-secret experiments . That he was being prepared to serve as a soldier in the coming war against Denizens of a parallel universe . " There is a war coming . Not a war of hatred and anger , a battle for survival . Many warriors of the inevitable confrontation are among us now . But before they can be considered soldiers , they must be regarded as recruits . " It 's all right here . He might as well have the ZFT memorized . But this is a manifesto from a terrorist cell in Germany . Yeah , ZFT ... It translates as destruction by the advancement of technology . It 's their mission statement . Yeah , that 's my point . You said Nick Lane 's been in the nut farm for years , right ? Well , the records go back to the mid ' 90s . So he 's been quoting the ZFT for at least that long . So when did they recruit him ? How old is he ? What ? Nick Lane . What year was he born ? 1979 . Where ? Jacksonville , Florida . Aren 't you from Jacksonville ? We need to talk to your father . Why , what do you think you know ? We need to talk to him now . Where 's the fire ? I always loved that expression , which is curious , since my lab assistant was killed in a fire . What can you tell me about Cortexiphan ? Oh , that takes me back . I remember belly whipping up a peyote mash- - Walter ! Cortexiphan was a highly experimental drug . William theorized that it might enhance certain abilities in ... predisposed children . Let me guess ... You experimented on people . Oh , no , no , not me . William . We had quite a disagreement about it . What abilities ? It worked on perception . Carlos Castaneda , Aldous Huxley , Werner Heisenberg ... All focused on one single elementary truth . Perception is the key to transformation . Reality is both subjective and malleable . If you can dream a better world , you can make a better world . Or perhaps travel between them . What did you just say ? So if Nick Lane was treated with Cortexiphan , he could change reality with his thoughts . He could make somebody do something just by thinking it . Not his thoughts . It 's how you feel that determines your view of the world . You 're saying that Cortexiphan worked on feelings . That 's reductive , but essentially , yes . What if Nick Lane ... wasn 't affecting people with his thoughts ? What if he was affecting them with his emotions ? The psychiatrist said that he was suicidal , right ? Uh , they said that his moods were contagious . What if he was on the platform because he was considering killing himself ? Oh , my ... Look , at the restaurant , all happy couples . It triggers his own fear of abandonment . And that woman caught his mood . For the sake of argument , let 's say that Nick 's emotions are contagious , like a virus . Maybe he 's even doing this , unwittingly . But it still doesn 't explain how it is that you 're seeing him in your dreams . If William had followed the usual procedures ... You see ... Often when we experimented on children ... Okay , can we just stop right there and analyze that sentence for a second ? We would put them in pairs . Like the buddy system in summer camp- - Listen to him ! He 's comparing human experimentation to summer camp ! This pairing kept them from becoming frightened or feeling isolated . Sometimes , an intense bond could form . A-A bond ... which could be greatly amplified by a drug like Cortexiphan . Alright , stop it , both of you . You 're creeping me out . Olivia was never treated with Cortexiphan . Is that true , Agent Dunham ? I might have been . What ? Well , that 's good news . How is that good news , Walter ? This Nick Lane of yours ... It means I may know how to find him . He 's sexually excited . His excitement has infected the dancer . She 's excited too . They 're leaving the club together . What , are you nuts , Ginger ? ! You 're in the middle of your shift ! What 's going on ? I 'm hypnotically stimulating R.E.M. state to enhance her psychic connection to Nick Lane . We 're tuning her antenna , as it were . Olivia can feel what Nick Lane is feeling . She can see what he 's seeing . Oh ... What 's happening ? Is he hurting her ? - Oh . - Oh ... What ? - Oh . - What ? - Oh ! - Oh , I see . He 's feeling guilt . Shame . He feels dirty . He hates himself . He wishes he was dead . The dancer ... He 's infecting her . She 's catching it . His emotions are jumping to her . How much he hates himself . The girl ... He 's infecting her . She 's dead . I killed her . No , you didn 't . You must stay under . Agent Dunham , you must try to stay under . She must try to stay under . What is going on ? Did he just kill someone ? Did he kill that dancer ? These are dreams . This boy is essentially a reverse empath . His feelings are killing people . Put simply ... Agent Dunham 's mind is recognizing the effects of his emotions on his victims and translating them into images that her dreaming mind can recognize . Put simply . Peter ... Help her . Help her calm down . Go ahead , son . Agent Dunham ... Where are you ? Where are you ? What can you see ? What can you see ? Agent Dunham ... Where are you ? I know where he lives . Clear ! Clear . Come over here . I think you should take a look at this . The torrent attack . Someone 's been a busy bee . Look at the dates on these papers . This guy 's been collecting this stuff for years . I 've always wanted a two-headed goat . What newspaper is this ? Can I get a subscription ? - Walter . - Why now ? He was given Cortexiphan over 20 years ago , right ? Why is this just happening now ? That lawyer shows up at the mental hospital with a magical inheritance , and all of a sudden Nick Lane becomes an emotional atom bomb ? Seems a little too coincidental to be coincidence in my book . So what are you saying ? You think he was activated ? " What was written will come to pass . " What ? It 's written on the wall over here . Got a call from a security guard downtown . We 've got a positive I.D. of Nick Lane entering a building . He 's not alone . Nick Lane may be turning into a walking epidemic . As his emotions become more intense , he may become more contagious . Great . Why can 't " more angry " ever translate into " less dangerous " ? And what are we supposed to do if we find him , anyway ? I mean , if we get too close to him , aren 't we gonna be infected with his emotions too ? Yes . But perhaps Agent Dunham would not . Why ? You were also treated with Cortexiphan . It might afford you some degree of immunity from Nick 's abilities . Why do I get the feeling you 're not telling us everything ? Because I don 't know everything . Officer , we 're with the FBI . You don 't want to go up there . We already sent a guy up , now he 's on the ledge too . We don 't know what the hell 's going on up there . - It 's okay , officer . - Olivia ... I 'm gonna be okay . Nick ? Nick Lane ? Olive . You heard me . You heard me . You came . You were always the strong one . Whenever I got scared , you could make me feel better . Do you remember , Olive ? I 'm sorry , no , I don 't . That-That 's okay . I think they meant for us to forget . I just couldn 't . I did what they told us . I-I waited , Olive . The soldier to come is both natural and unnatural . I waited to be called up . You stay fit , stay focused , stay ready . I wore the blacks and grays . I blended in . But the call never came . It never came . Then , that man with the glasses ... He showed up at the hospital . He spoke all the old words . He said they 're coming . He needed warriors . He said , " What was written will come to pass . " He said he knew how to wake me up . I shouldn 't have listened to him . Sometimes what we wake up , it can 't be put back to sleep . Nick . You don 't have to do this . I want to stop hurting people ! Take it . Take it . Shoot me . Please , Olive ? I can 't fight this much longer . Listen to me . Calm down ... Aah ! Uh . Maybe eight miles , it ... I do hope Agent Dunham meant to do that . Shoot me ... Or I will jump , and they will all jump with me . Shoot me , Olive . I have to die , or I will keep hurting people . Please . We weren 't made for this . Don 't make me take them all with me . Please ? I 'm sorry . Olive ... You 'll wish you had . You 'll wish you 'd killed me . Nick Lane 's parents died several years ago . Car accident . His lawyer 's identity appears to have been falsified . We 've repeated our request to Massive Dynamic for information regarding the Cortexiphan protocols . But according to Nina Sharp , the names of the participants were deleted from the records . And you still have no memory of the trials ? - Of being treated with the drug ? - No . - No . - But he does . - Yes . - Why do you think that is ? I don 't know . You saved his life . He 's being kept in a drug-induced coma . For how long ? Indefinitely . He said sometimes what we wake up can 't be put back to sleep . I wonder if he was right . Are you all right , Dunham ? Yes . Hey . Aunt Liv ... The stuff that they put in me isn 't dead anymore . It came back alive . Can that really happen ? It 's just bad dreams , baby girl . It 's just bad dreams . Come on . Ooh , you 're getting so big . I 'm gonna put you back to bed . I 'm breaking about a thousand regulations by doing this . - Here 's Nick Lane 's file . - I know . I appreciate it , Charlie . Thank you . Okay . Is the incident contained ? Yes , Dr. Bell . - How bad ? - Bad . - Casualties ? - Not sure yet . We can 't locate Brenner . Is she okay ? She 's fine . Hell , do we know what triggered it ? Obviously , she was upset with you . It 's okay . It 's all right now . Nobody is angry with you . You didn 't do anything bad . It 's all right , Olive . Everything 's going to be okay . Transcript : Yyets.net

Mr. Garrison , what happened to you ? Long story , I , uh ... It attached his car and it got Mr. Peterson too . Mr. Peterson 's dead ? Attacked his car ? Look , Mr. Peterson didn 't die in a car wreck , okay ? He survived with me . Okay , he went to go get some help and , on the way he was apparently attacked by something else . Didn 't attack you . No . It 's important to understand it 's patterns so we can see what attracts it to its prey . I think it 'd be noise . Or movement . Was I asking you ? What the hell did you write in that article ? Hey , that 's between me and Bob Woodward . He was commissioned last year by the city council to eradicate a bear problem . So it was an article about how the big bear hunter didn 't catch his big bear trophy . I just-Talk to me about this alien . Aliens . Aliens . There 's more than one .

There 's the other thing too . Jesus Christ . You don 't want to leave . You don 't want to stay . You don 't want to fight . So what do we do ? Sit here and wait till it picks us off one by one ? Hey thanks for stopping by . No , no , no . We shot at it . We scared it . Most of the time we 've spent running from it . It 's bigger than us . We need to call the military . Military ? Yeah , you got a problem with that ? Hell yeah ! Oh no , Daddy doesn 't like the military too much . We 're not sending them cookies , Sweetheart . We 're just - Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! This is a big story for you . Maybe this is your trophy , Woodward ? No , I 'm afraid I won 't be here to write that story . Well maybe you won 't ! Are you guys done ? Yeah . Anything ?

He 's not going to quit until the game 's over . What are you suggesting ? We lure the creature and we trap it . You 're joking , right ? Nobody 's joking , Figgus . Okay , we know what 's going to lure it . That 's us . Now how are we going to trap it ? That thing climbs like a son of a bitch . Well , let 's trap it some place it can 't climb . Where ? A quarry , uh , what about a big , open field ? There 's an open field over that ridge . We could set up points on the border line . It 's a bit of a bench region but there 's no vegetation . Even if we get it over there how do we know the hunter 's going to show up ? We don 't . But then again maybe we trap it velociraptor style . Meaning what ? Again , we lure it . We trap it . And we blast it . We make it the choke point . That 's a stupid idea , man . We get down the hill and we find help . Alright ? Freckles . Shit . * MUSIC What is it ? Well , some kind of weapon or something . I don 't know . We found it on the ship . Can I see it ? It 's heavy . I know . Some kind of a polymer or composite material ? I 've never seen anything like that before . Why are we stopping ? Checking wind direction . ( RADAR DETECTION ) This just keeps getting better and better . Oh ! Oh my god ! Get down ! Shoot it !

( LAUGHING ) I think I 'm going to hang it up in my flower shop . ( LAUGHING ) Where are you going ? I don 't know . Why don 't you come with us ? Us ? Are you going to write about this ? I don 't know . I haven 't thought about it . You should . Well , I could use a writing partner . Yeah . Okay ? Yeah ! ( LAUGHING ) - Let 's go . - Okay ! Why not ? Okay . I 'll bring some extra lizards . ( LAUGHING ) RADIO : Hey Danny , did you bag it ? It 's an eight legger with a three foot cranium . RADIO : That beats your old record . Well , my kid needs some new armor . RADIO : What took you so long ? Your wife thought you were dead . Let 's just say I ran into some local trouble . RADIO : That 's what you get when you go off the grid . Really ? This place is definitely terra-formed . RADIO : Anything worth hunting ? Nah , nothing here . RADIO : You ready to come home ?

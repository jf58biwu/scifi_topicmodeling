 Hello ? Who 's there ? ( GASPING ) The nun ! Help me ! She 's here ! The nun ! The nun ! My Nan and Mrs Randall go way back . She used to live next door . Nan says there 's no way Mrs Randall makes things up . SARAH JANE : It 's not just her that 's been scared by this ghostly nun ? CLYDE : Yeah , always at night , in their rooms . Nora saw her first . She 'd been to the loo . Dreadful trouble she has with her waterworks . Three or four times every night . She comes out of the bathroom and there she is . The nun , by her chest of drawers . What happened ? She fainted clean away like a schoolgirl . No constitution at all . Surprised , the amount of times she 's been married . Since then most of us have seen her . Them that 's not too ga-ga not to notice . SARAH JANE : Thank you for your help . So , will there be a photographer ? I was in all the papers once . Miss Ealing of 1 951 . I have to talk to the manager first . I 've got a few little jobs for Clyde to do . Your grandma said you wouldn 't mind . ( WOMAN SPEAKING ON RADIO ) Delicious . If he hadn 't been spending so much time in the office - then I wouldn 't have thought of salsa classes . - Salsa ? Ivan gets all possessive and next thing I know Carlos is on the floor with a bloody nose . - Carlos ? - My salsa teacher . - Ivan 's got the push ? - Don 't get your hopes up . Just a nudge . To let him know what he stands to lose . - And you 're planning on staying here , are you ? - Where else am I going to go ? Mum ! The Colonel won 't believe us . But who would ? Better to keep mum . Yes , better that way . - Are you all right ? - Yes . Quite all right , thank you . Are you one of the Colonel 's chaps ? - The Colonel ? No , I ... - I 'm Bea Nelson-Stanley . I 'm looking for my husband , the Professor . He said to meet him between the paws of the ... What do you call it ? - The Sphinx . - The Sphinx ? - Yes . - That 's in Egypt . - You 're the boy in the window . - My name 's Luke . We were visiting Mrs Randall . She says this place is haunted by a nun . Have you seen her ? Yes , I have . And she 's no ghost . There 's something different about you . Oh , don 't be afraid . I 've seen unusual people before . Perhaps you can help me . I understand that you 're looking for a good story . Might I suggest you try Westminster . You don 't believe Lavender Lawns is haunted ? One of the old dears has a nightmare , tells her friend she 's seen a ghost , then next thing , they 've all seen one . - It 's hysteria . It 's as simple as that . - Perhaps . Or maybe it 's a cry for attention . - We have to be quick in case anyone is watching . - Who 's watching ? The ... Oh , for goodness ' sake . I have these gaps . Hold this . I knew they might find me one day but I couldn 't be parted from it . - Foolish old woman . - What is it ? Never you mind . Just promise me you will not tell anyone you have the Talisman . And whatever you do , do not let her get it . - Do not let her get it . - Who ? Put it away and promise me . I promise . But who 's after it ? - Do I know you ? - What ? - Anything I can help with ? - You and maths ? I don 't think so . At school the only figures I was interested in was boys ' phone numbers . We could do something together later . Go into town , do some maths on my credit card ? I 'd like to but I said I 'd go over to Sarah Jane 's . Sarah Jane 's ? Maria , come on , I 'm your mum . What are you doing gallivanting with those weirdos ? Sarah Jane and Luke aren 't weirdos . It 's weird how much time you spend with her . And there 's something about that boy . - He 's just not right . - You don 't know anything about them ! - I 'm just trying to protect you . - I don 't need you to protect me . Come on , darling , every girl needs her mum . - How come you walked out on me ? - Maria ! Get out ! Get out ! Why is it old people want you to do everything for them ? Turn the mattress over . Move things around . Take that spider out the bath . I came here looking for spooks . - Everyone gets old . Even you . - Not me . The way technology 's moving , by the time I 'm 40 I can get my brain put in a robot and live forever . - Where have you been ? - Just looking around . - Let 's get going . - What 's the story then ? Is this place haunted ? I don 't know . But there 's something about it here I don 't like . - What 's the problem ? - She doesn 't like me seeing Sarah Jane and Luke , like she knows anything about them ! - We 'll be back to normal in a few days . - She 'll be back with Ivan . If he doesn 't see sense and do a runner while she 's gone . Doesn 't it bother you ? - Maria , your mum and me , that 's all over . - Well , that 's great for you , isn 't it ? Some solicitor gives you a paper and it 's all over ! - She 's always going to be my mum ! - I know that . Of course she is . I want her to get to know my friends and maybe I don 't want her to go back to Ivan . But that 's never going to happen , is it ? Because you 've got a bit of paper ! I 've come to see Sister Helena . Mr Smith , I need you . MR SMITH : Sarah Jane , what can I do for you ? The Lavender Lawns Rest Home is apparently haunted by a nun . Access central land registry database . - See if anything supports the possibility . - Of a haunting ? - Just run the check . - Very well . - Doesn 't Mr Smith believe in ghosts ? - Not as such . Neither do I. There is no record of any past ecclesiastical building on the site . So no obvious reason for the home to be haunted by a nun ? I assume you mean the projection of energies imprinted on psychic-assimilating matter . - Obviously . - Come again ? Events get recorded on their surroundings then they get played back . Are you aware that Luke has brought an unidentified element of alien technology ? - What ? - No way did that come off the shopping channel . - Give it to me . - Mrs Nelson-Stanley gave it me . I had to keep it a secret . I 'm sorry . Was that wrong ? I don 't know . Mr Smith , is it safe ? Insufficient data . I 'd like to carry out a detailed analysis . - There 's a lot of sensitive equipment in here . - Sorry . - So what 's going on ? - Some old biddy 's given Luke an alien gizmo . She said the nun wasn 't a ghost . I 'd better go talk to Mrs Nelson-Stanley . Do you want to come with me ? - You two stay here . - But she gave it to me . - And I brought you in on this . - No arguments . You all right ? ( WHISPERS ) Mum 's back . It isn 't like Maria . She never used to be such a drama queen . That 's another gene she managed to give the slip . She 'll be over there , with that Sally Jane . - We all need a friend . You 've got your teacher . - There 's nothing going on . - I 've got too good a thing with Ivan . - You hadn 't with me and Maria ? If you want to pick a fight , do it some other day . - I 'm too worried . - You 're worried now . What 's that supposed to mean ? Why didn 't you think before you dumped yourself on us today ? It isn 't your home . You took our home apart six months ago . Showing up like that , it has consequences . - And you 're sure it was the Talisman ? - Absolutely . I saw her give it to the boy . Why would she give it to him unless she knew we were looking for it ? - You told us she barely knows her own name . - I know where you can find him . All the same , we have paid you well for your assistance , Mrs Gribbins , but this just complicates everything . The Abbess will want to see you . The Abbess ? ( CLEARS THROAT ) ( SCREAMING ) Poor Bea , she can 't really tell you anything . It 's the Alzheimer 's , you know . - Such a tragedy . After the life she led . - She 's been everywhere . Is this her husband ? Archaeologist , so the nurses reckon . They went all over the world together . What happened to him ? Died five years ago . Bea started to lose it after that . That 's when she washed up here . The Talisman ! Talisman ? I thought you wanted to talk to her about the ghost . - Bea , you 've got visitors . - Do I know you ? I 'm sorry , I 'm not very good with faces . This is Sarah Jane Smith . She 's a reporter . Oh , it 's my husband you want to talk to then . It 's you I need to talk to . Where you got this talisman ? - That 's my Edgar . - MARIA : Your husband ? Yes . He used to say the Sontarans were the silliest-looking race in the galaxy . - What did you say ? - She 's always going on about spacemen . - She 's seen Sontarans ! - What 's a Sontaran ? The silliest race in the galaxy ! That 's what Edgar used to say . Like a huge potato with ... a ray gun . Quite nasty blighters , they were . Yes , Bea , they are ! You 're absolutely right . You shouldn 't encourage her . She 'll go on about monsters , especially the Gorgon . I saw that years ago at the flicks with Christopher Lee and Barbara Shelley . - Hello . - Hello , I 'm Sister Helena from St Agnes Abbey . - Who might you be ? - He 's Luke , I 'm Clyde . Which one of you were at Lavender Lawns today and left with a gift from one of the ladies ? - We don 't know what you 're talking about . - How do you know ? - Can it , Luke ! - Why are you looking for the Talisman ? - Luke ! - You don 't understand what you 've got . - You 're not getting your hands on it . - Give me the Talisman ! Hello , Sister . Collection , is it ? Roofs don 't fix themselves . That 's one miracle we 're still working on . I always give to needy causes . You could say it 's a good habit of mine . I was after Maria . You haven 't seen her , have you ? - She 's gone out with Sarah Jane . - Look , do me a favour . When they get back , just tell her I was looking . - Of course . - Cheers . When weirdo nuns turn up on your doorstep asking about freaky glowing alien gizmos , one thing you never do is tell them you got one . - I didn 't . We should call Mum . - Better still , we should go and tell her . - Isn 't phoning quicker ? - Sure . Or we can get back in on the action . So if Bea 's wearing the Talisman , and it 's alien , and she 's seen Sontarans , then she isn 't talking about horror movies , is she ? Aliens have been coming to Earth for centuries . Maybe Bea 's adventures with her husband involved a lot more than just pots and bones . This was our song . Edgar had such a lovely voice . - Did he ? I 'm sure he was quite a man . - It 's so sad . The things she must have seen and now everyone thinks she 's crazy . Who knows where any of us will end up ? But someone doesn 't think you 're crazy . Someone knows what that Talisman is and they want it . - The Talisman ? - Yes , the Talisman . I promise I 'll believe you . Sometimes people have thought I 've been mad . But I 've seen things , too . Edgar unearthed it in a dig in ... in ... Syria . He gave it to me and he had no idea what it was . He had no idea . - So what is it ? - They mustn 't find it ! They mustn 't find it ! - Who , Bea ? Who do you mean ? - The sisters ! - The nuns ? - They protect her . Protect who ? The Gorgon . It 's all in here , I know it is . A Gorgon , snakes for hair and turning people to stone ? - It 's a fairy story , isn 't it ? - A Greek myth . There 's a big difference . Incidentally , for future reference , even some fairytales have a foundation in fact . Here it is . " There were three Gorgons . The hideous daughters of Phorcys the sea god and Ceto . " Stheno , Euryale and Medusa . " That 's right . But in some versions there was just one , Medusa . And she wasn 't always ugly . She was a beautiful nymph with golden hair , but Poseidon fell in love with her and jealous Athena turned her into a Gorgon . MARIA : " Medusa was killed by Perseus as a challenge . " The Greeks were always dishing out challenges . It must be a man thing . But this one had to be a tough call . Warrior after warrior tried to slay the Gorgons , but all had been turned to stone . - Because they had to look at them . - Perfect defence mechanism . Once you laid eyes on a Gorgon there was no escape . Your body was turning to stone . There was nothing you could do . One glance is all it took . Terrifying . - Does Bea believe Gorgons actually existed ? - I think she believes one still does . ( TYRES SCREECHING ) Oh , no , it 's Sister Sinister again . Don 't run away , Luke . I won 't hurt you . I just want to have a little chat . - What about ? - Don 't listen to her . No way is she a nun . - Whatever else would I be ? - I don 't know . But I bet you ain 't got legs under them robes , just a bunch of tentacles . Your friend watches too much TV . I think we could talk sensibly without him . - We 'll go to the abbey . - I don 't think so . - You 're safe . - We 're not going anywhere . It 's not an open invitation . Listen to your friend and you 'll be in far more danger , I guarantee . But I can help you . I want to help you . - The Talisman is dangerous ? - More than you can imagine . No way ! Luke ! Clyde ! Clyde ! Clyde ! - It 's an alien ? - Remember what I said . Aliens have been coming here for thousands of years . - And one 's survived all this time ? - Perhaps . How can it turn people to stone just by looking horrible ? I doubt that 's quite how it works . Hello ? - CLYDE : Luke has been nabbed by a nun . - What ? I warned him not to talk to that nun ! I tried to stop it but it just happened so fast ! - Calm down . - She was after the Talisman . - Where has she taken Luke ? - She 's from some abbey . - Obviously . Think , which one ? - I 've been trying to ! Some woman 's name . - The old lady detective ... - Miss Marple ? Agatha Christie ? St Agatha ? - Agnes ! St Agnes Abbey ! - Get in the car ! Hello , my name is Felicity Barnes . I 'm doing a story on religion in the 21 st century . Is there anyone I can talk to ? Oh , perhaps Sister Helena ? So much for fake ID . - Now what ? Where do we go ? - I don 't know . What do nuns do with kids they kidnap ? - Let 's start here . - What if it 's in there ? This Gorgon thing . Just keep your eyes closed and hold my hand . ( GORGON HISSING ) - Luke ! Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . What do you think you 're doing getting into a stranger 's car ? For an intelligent boy , I can 't believe how stupid you are ! - I didn 't just get in ... - Luke was never in any danger . It seemed that bringing him here was the fastest way of attracting your attention . Although your other two young friends were a surprise . - We found Mrs Gribbins . - She 's been turned to stone . - Mrs Gribbins always was a useless old fossil . - Are you really protecting a Gorgon here ? A creature with writhing serpents for hair ? Those melodramatic Greeks . They never could resist embellishing a story . But , yes , as you 've seen , the myth isn 't entirely without foundation . ( GORGON HISSING ) - But it 's an alien , right ? - The Gorgons travelled here 3000 years ago . - Once there was three , now only one . - A real live Gorgon ? Generations of our sisterhood have protected the Gorgons down the centuries . What happened to the other two ? One was killed when our sisterhood served Demeter , when the key was stolen . The key to whatever brought the Gorgons to Earth . And the sisters have been searching for it ever since . Did you get close once , maybe 50 years ago ? Was that when the second Gorgon died ? Professor Nelson-Stanley and his wife . But you have the key now , Miss Smith . I 'm sure you will be more reasonable . I wouldn 't bet on it . Kidnapping , turning people to stone . Not the kind of things that make me feel reasonable . Sarah Jane , 3000 years is a long time , even for a being with the Gorgon 's life span . She is old . The Talisman opens a portal to the Gorgon 's world . She only wants to go home to die . You can understand that , can 't you ? - Why should I believe you ? - Miss Smith , you have no choice . All right . We 'll get it . - The boys stay here . - No ! They 'll be perfectly safe , as long as you don 't try to deceive us . ( GORGON HISSING ) - We can 't give them the Talisman . - But at least we 're on my territory now . We are , but they 've still got the boys . The girl stays with me . Move . - Sorry . Analysis incomplete . - Shh ! Keep your voice down ! Is this because I 'm picking up a hostile alien intelligence ? Yes , and it 's about to meet another one . - Doesn 't she speak English ? - The Gorgon doesn 't need to speak . She 's telepathic ? Is that how she controls you ? Looking after a Gorgon isn 't exactly normal for nuns , is it ? I 'd shut up if I were you or the Abbess might show you her idea of solving a problem like Maria . Is this what you 've spent 3000 years looking for ? The key to the portal . What do you think you 're doing ? Either let my son and his friend go , or I will destroy the Talisman . I warned you , Miss Smith . Now look on the face of the Gorgon and feel your flesh turn to stone . Don 't look , Maria ... - Hello ? The door was open ... - Dad ! Dad ! We have the key . Rejoice , sisters , the Gorgons shall be free . - Mother Abbess . - She is weakening . SISTER HELENA : We must open the portal as soon as possible . It 's killed these people and put them on show . MARIA : Is there a way to save him ? The Talisman . It is the key to the door between this world and theirs . It returned me to flesh and blood . Have you got it ? There 's loads of them . They 're everywhere . ( CHANTING ) The Gorgons have chosen a new host to lead its domination of Earth . You , Miss Smith . DVD Rip by DrMatt 2008

 Spring 1945 . World War II . Allies advancing Europe trampling German war machine in its unstoppable progress towards Berlin . But while fighting in Europe closer to the end , the war continues in the Pacific . American and Japanese forces fighting in the air , at sea and in the countless small islands . The battle lines are constantly moving . At one nameless atoll , unexpected the enemy is waiting for your turn on the battlefield ... 3 months later ... - That was well captain , - Can we go back to the stomach now ? We have to try this baby before our guys get it . If you say so . Just remember , you break it , you pay it . The keeper has act again . one of these days going to put one of these planes into their parts I 'm just looking out f or all of us as you know shut up and grace - okay I was thinking . - That 's not good . No really I 've been giving it some thought ِAll I 'm saying is this ... Switches the planes where they are needed . And sometimes , like now , we fly the first plane . Right ? - Aha . I think that if we are the first crew , then we need to give him a name . You want to give the name of the plane ? Will only call the plane by yourself . Will the plane called the huts ? And why not ? Is there a better name ? Viki , Lena . - Hold on Roger that I wonder what he wants to name the plane after her Roger that I 'm sorry honey , the captain says he will not be able to . Prepare for landing . Fools . Ready for landing Keeper Roger that Nicki told on girls will all be wearing grass skirts before you know it Welcome to Hawaii , ladies . Roger that Captain ... - Say , Viki . You must report to the command . We should be ready to wait . It will not be good news . - Never . Betsy , come with me . girls if the brass hats come by remember just so that 's what I 'm saying like to see Of course , Captain . Come in Sir , Maxine Vest , Women Air Force pilot , is reporting . Miss West , this is Colonel Toler . - Colonel . Ms. Vest . B29 was delivered as ordered , sir . Keep this document . You need to take them and 10 th . The 10-tu ? Perhaps Colonel knows we 're flying from Wichita to Lombija . With a rather nasty weather . You 'll fly again . As soon as the plane is supplemented by fuel You and your team you 'll fly on a modified B29 , Colonel Toler , its people and cargo , the airport , and 10 , where you will receive further instructions . Cargo , sir ? The burden and mission of Colonel Toller are a military secret . I understand , sir . You will be under the command of Colonel Toller . Understand ? - Yes , sir , Moving for an hour , I propose to inform the crew . I understand , thank you sir . What happens ? - There is nothing more than a holiday . This is madness , kidnaps a pig . I can not fly in the storm . Viki , Toller say that we need to bypass the storm , we are overweight . I see . Colonel , Captain says we must change course . Not . - But , Colonel ... There will be no change of course for nothing ! Tell that to Mrs. Vest . Captain , the Colonel says there 's no change of course for nothing . I see . It 's getting worse , Captain . - Son of a ... We have to change course . Betsy , take control and maintain a straight line . I 'm going to explain to the colonel . Tell him in my name , captain . Viki , find a place to land until the storm passes . We get out of the storm . Colonel , before you say anything , consider insistence on suicide . We can rise above the storm . I need to land . If you still can . There are no other options . What was that , goddamn it ? There is a good chance to land in occupied territory . I can not let the enemy grabs our cargo . We have no choice , sir . Captain , something flying past us . Something great . Looks like we have company . In this case it is better to finish at the bottom of the ocean than in their hands . Stay on course . Murphy , get ready ! Did you feel it ? Be careful with that enemy . Find me a place to land . - Do you have orders , Miss ! You really would shoot me , Colonel ? Lena ! Lena , honey , can you hear me ? Lena , wake up ! - Captain ! Wake up ! - Captain ! She is gone Captain . She 's dead . Max ... - Position for emergency landing . What happened there ? Are you all right ? Lena is dead . - What ? And now together . Pull ! Did you see what hit us ? I have no idea , but I know it was not a plane . That ! - We made it ! We have not pulled out . Running out of fuel . Come on , we must somewhere to land . We 're in the middle of nowhere , Max . No dole nothing . What attacked us came from somewhere , There must be some place , the last hope . One island ! Thank God . - Last hope ... Remind me to sometimes take to the track to bet . We 're going too fast for landing . We 'll have to make a circle . Viki , tell everyone that bind , We 'll be landing . Done . - I understand . What happens ? - Sit down , sir ! Please , Colonel . Trust the captain about this . We believe . Damn , we lost and others . Well , this is going to hurt . Hold on ! Damn it , do not betray me now , we will succeed ! I promised myself that I would die happy in bed . I do not intend to break that promise . Hold on ! This will be it through the eye of a needle . Help me to stop him ! I told you so ! - Impressive . Congratulations , you have succeeded despite the poor odds . We have avoided the pan . Let 's see if we have fallen into the fire . I found this . Take it . We 'll watch each other . - I understand . Sergeant Li , Miss Smith ! Let me see your grenade . Miss Smith ... - I 'm huts . Do you know how to use this ? I know . - Okay . If it encounters a stranger , I want to make the catch and throw them on the plane , okay ? Yes . The explosion will destroy all around . I 'm counting on you . You 'll be fine . I do not think there 's someone . Maybe just an animal . I not wered. - Good . You will need us to take us back . Okay . Captain , have you seen the side of the plane ? Yes . What you could do it on the B29 ? And if there are more ? Can it be fixed ? - To correct ? Should not the first to find what we do so ? It was not a Japanese plane . Thank you , though I have no experience , I realized . Whatever it was , it does not change our situation . We need to get off . Is it possible to sustainably ? I have no idea . Parts of the problem . No luck , Colonel . Okay . First things first . Check for enemies on the island . You and your girlfriend stay here and repair the damage to the plane . You 'll be safe here . - We do not need security . My girls have received the same training as the male pilots . They can take care of themselves . After what happened last year , we must do something . I think confusing orders with options . Just advise colonel on the resources under his command . Well , Miss Quigley will remain with Ms. Smith to repair the damage . done Betsy , I 've got to know what it takes to take off . Aye , aye , Captain . Keep your weapon with you and be close to the aircraft . Watch the sky . Before you ask , I 'm staying with you , Captain . That 's what I thought . Stay close . Spread out or stay in sight . We will look for evidence of the presence of the enemy on the island . Fuel , medical supplies and parts for airplanes . Possible sources of water and food . You do not have to say how dangerous it is . If you see any movement on the ground or in the air do not think , shoot immediately . Here we go . This place is creepy . - Quiet . What was that ? - They call him the wind , silent . For God 's sake ! Here someone . How he got to the tree ? Colonel , this is a Japanese uniform . Well the answer to one question . Proceed with caution ! This is bad , Marv . - You worry too much Radio is destroyed . On a secret mission we have . We will not call for help . We landed in an empty enemy base . At least I hope it was empty . Okay , maybe empty . Too scared . I guess you 're right . Cheer up , on a tropical island we with 4 beautiful women . When the sun comes up tomorrow , the sky will be blue and me in paradise . Just think about it . This is no time for romance . Who said anything about romance ? Son , enjoy life whenever and wherever you can . Life is too short . Damn , and it 's shorter . Not good . Maxi , calm down . Will not be able to . - Colonel , if you propose Calm down , things are not what they look like . I found the runway with a lot of empty Zero . I understand . Murphy ... Pull slowly and cover us background . Make sure that there are no more of these friends there . I see . This is the captain . That any evacuation would not be here . A no planes would not be left behind . So , whatever happened here was not the usual battle ? That 's right . Put the gun down and let the girl , now ! What the hell was that ? Enough of this shit , give up or I 'll blow your head off ! Shoot the first one to move . But sir ... - They did not fire a single bullet ... I think you do not have ammunition . Is not that right ? Capture them . How is Murphy ? - We have to stop the bleeding and get to safety . Who knows when it will reappear miracle . Go back to the plane . Take a torch for protection . He used it when we were attacked . Li and I will find a comfortable accommodation for our new friends . Ms. Vest , go with them . And please , no discussions . I understand , but if you need to call . At ease , Murphy . They make you problems ? - No , sir . Occasionally something babble but I think it is happy that they are full . Do not underestimate them . They succeeded where their comrades are not . And a few months . They must be capable of . I see . Will we soon the island ? We are working on it . I expect to find more tombs . What miracle does not leave anything for burial . There 's a time for everything . For each question in heaven . time to be born and a time to die . Time to plant and a time to harvest planted . Time to demolish and a time to build . Time to weep and a time to laugh . The time for mourning and a time to dance . Time to disease and weather for loss Time to stay and a time to go . During the war and times of peace . Some flights soul . Cables are broken , damaged two engines Some cables are damaged . But the good news is that there are parts of the island . We can sustainably plane and fly out of here . When ? - 4 to 5 days . Unacceptable . - That 's the thing , Colonel . And at the time they are not included outgrown Canaries . What was that , Captain ? I have no idea . Like something out of King Kong . And there are more . One is not enough to destroy the base . You heard those screams last night . We need to get out of here . Radio the plane is correct . We can call for help . Can not . The mission was a secret environment full of enemies . We can not risk it . - We have no other choice . Maybe there is something . Japanese planes . - I do not like it , Bets . They have 20mm cannons for defense . They 're too vulnerable . Explain . We blow up one of them . Take off all unnecessary . Leaving only a reservoir , control and wings . We could get to Australia for assistance . Ms. Vest is right . It would not be raised from the ground . The screaming stopped at dawn , which means love at night . Pokretenjem engine and takeoff to attract their attention . Claws those things are almost growled B29 . Zero would cut up like paper . How much ammunition they have ZERO ? There are many , but there is no ammunition for rifles and pistols . Colonel , we need only one stripped Zero . You could pick it up in the air ready to fight . The rest of my crew would fly to him . This could be good . If all goes well , they would be here for 16 hours . When I say that , I do not think this is the best solution . I 'd rather wait to raise B29 into the air . The decision is yours . Accepts offered . Do what you can . I 'm glad you said that . I see . Betsy , organize Zero and let Viki help with fuel . I see . Colonel . Just a minute . Yes , Miss West ? I 've already lost a crew member for something from the comics . There are chances to lose another one . Do not you think we deserve knowing why it is so important to your cargo ? I understand how you feel . But let me once again refer to the facts . This mission is top secret . Highest priority axes . And what is the nature of my cargo is concerned , is not none of your business . I do not care for your lack of cooperation . But if you and your girlfriend try to find out what is my mission ... I will not hesitate to kill you on the spot . I see . It will be a shame if this man stood in front of the propeller in motion . What do you think they are ? Dinosaurs . Honey , you 're your comics you destroy the brain . Dinosaurs are extinct . - Do not . Nobody 's seen . There are more . That 's what they said about dragons , and yet it is the type found on that island . You mean the Komodo dragons ? They are not really dragons . They look like they did . What do you think , Captain ? - I have no idea . I 'm just glad that it looks like the fire is dismissed . Viki , what do you have ? - Just a moment , keeper It is possible , but there is a catch . To ZERO reached their destination , they must be stripped to the bone . Even when we take weapons and all unnecessary ... a pilot may not weigh more than 50kg . Even if everything off ? That 's right . - I 'm a heavy 62kg . Would I have been able to reach you ? I would not know . There are no guarantees . There must be some way . - Yes , I am serious 50Kg . Heavy 50Kg and I can fly . No , you 're not ready for this . With all due respect , I did . You 're on a whole crew of at least flown . It is a long flight and without those damn flying . You 're a brave girl , but I do not . I will . It is the best choice because of the weight . You know that , Captain . I said that I will not fly . The thing is over . Ms. Vest , Girl 's our best chance . Is that an order , Colonel ? - No , of course , you know better . Captain , huts need to fly , and you be escorted . Huts years to zero . Betsy , Vicky and I are flying escort . You 'd better fail or you 'll become flooded Mom butt . You understand ? - Yes madam . Okay . We fly at dawn . Thank you , Colonel . - Ms. Vest . You 'll make a hole in the floor , Takase . Something is bothering you ? This was not how he imagined his end , Captain . Do you feel that you are approaching death ? You know it would kill us . If we are to die , let us die in battle . Too fast prigrljuješ death . Our execution is not certain . With all due respect , sir , how can you say that ? You know that the Americans are relentless . You need to learn patience . As our captain . He is waiting to see if our enemy to destroy one another . Patience , for the sheep . I will die in battle for their country . Do me a favor , Takashi . Do not hurry to die . The young soldiers are still rushing to their deaths . This is the tragedy of war . Hello . - Hello . I 'm Vanesa . My friends call me Huts . Nick from home , so ... - ice cream cones . Their slogan was ... Huts , handsome , cute , fun to eat . Sorry , did not mean to ... I am Li , John Li . They call me a Li . - I know . I was wondering ... Is everything all right ? - Yes . I have to watch them , but I have it under control . I bet it is . Well ... ? I just wanted to ... I do not know if you know , tomorrow I 'm going on a mission . I never really ... Namely ... I just wanted to know what it feels like to kiss you ... before I go . Huts ... - I gotta go . Thank you . I like you . You too . All right , ladies , line up in formation . Betsy and I protect hips , Viki protects the background . Done . - Understood . Captain , is this time really necessary ? Done . - I wish I had not.over Captain , the bandits to 6 hours . - Understood . Viki , stay with huts , Betsy and I are going to attack . Only peaceful huts , proguraćemo you through this . I understand , sir , but come back soon . Do you have a canary in the tail , Betsy . I see . You are mine . He was just busted girl . Stay calm . Do not freaking . When it could so . - What does it say , sir ? Viki ! See , stay calm and keep the course . Viki . - Do not worry . You are mine ! I told you not to worry . Fine , but do not wait for more last minute . Huts , Betsy and I are going back in formation . Aye , aye , Captain . Thank you . Looks like we 'll make it , Captain . No maleriši , Betsy . Captain , at 3 hours . Damn , I told you , Bets . We will not succeed , I order the return to the airport immediately . But , Captain . - Without debate , huts . Just 4 100 of them . On landing , immediately . Move your butt , ladies . Here they are . Captain , wait . I 'm going with you . No , Betsy . Rinse huts to safety . I 'm coming for you . I 'm hit ! - How bad is it ? They can not land . - Betsy ? Can , Captain . Be careful . Bring huts house . I 'll wait for you . Done . They will not be able to , dammit . Huts in 12 hours . Above you . Not ! Nothing we could , Captain . - Tell that to the huts ! Max ... - Enough Betsy . It 's an order ! But that is not right and you know it . She was still a child . What are we going to do now ? How to get out of this nightmare ? You can not . Do you know English ? - Obvious . Bring him here , Murphy . I studied at Brown University in the United States . Class 138th I can not tell you how impressed I am . Identify slide , duck I 'm Osun , an officer of the Imperial Japanese Air Force . And others know English ? - Unfortunately no . Just me . You do not ... - That 's enough , Miss Quigley . What the hell happened here ? Come on , you spoke to did not want to share . There is no harm if I tell you . Excavation of the tunnel on this island ... a group of my people discovered a cave with eggs of these primeval dragons . What we are more destroyed , the more of them appeared . We could not call for help because it would not come as soon as possible . We found behind enemy lines , obsessed with monsters . We tried several times to escape , as you are . But all attempts failed . Destroy all you lift into the air . - Wait a minute ! You knew that we would not succeed , and you have not told us ? Would you believe us ? Ms. West , you are the enemy . What you are is less , the better for us . - Son of a bitch ! I 'm sorry about the death of a young girl . Also sorry for the death of the 50 young people from my company . This island is a nightmare , as you said , your sergeant . But I do not have an obligation to help . You are still enemies . Then you have no reason to not execute immediately . You will not do it . It 's not in your nature . Try me . - We 'd be dead , that the colonel did not think we would be beneficial . Calm down , Miss West . We might still be of use . But I promise you that when the time comes , you can pull the trigger , right ? Agree slide , duck I have a few hundred questions for you , Captain . You 'll have to wait . The day was long . I 'm tired . Can I go back to my people ? - Give it back there , Murphy . All the rest . We continue at dawn . Murphy , you first stand guard . - Yes , sir . This change in 3h . Keep the fire . We do not want visitors tonight . Go to sleep . Dismissed . Captain ? - Say , Takashi . Should not we call that a plan ? - For what ? Getaway ! - I have more important things on his mind than escape . Captain ? - The colonel is an unusual man . Such a person always has a mission , and I would like to know that . But monsters ? - We survived monsters . Our problems are coming to an end . Think , Takashi . The Americans brought our means of escape . When you fix it , swollen by and leave them on this wall . Only the three men against us , and one of them was injured . A wife ? - They are not a threat . Means of escape is our wish that whenever you use it . But before we go , I want to know what led to the colonel to our little home . I will not be solved so easily . - I almost did . May I ask , why Colonel sneaking through the jungle in the middle of the night ? I need to know how many of those creatures . Looking for their nests . You said there was an attack on the other side of the island . That 's where I went . I 'm going with you . - It is dangrous Miss Vest ! Do not be afraid , Colonel , I will keep you back . We must be close . I 'm sorry about the girl . She had a name . Her name was Vanessa . Her friends caهاتسts . - I 'm sorry about huts . The decision was difficult , but I had to try it . You need to move on . - That 's right . What is it ? - See for yourself . Careful . There are hundreds of them . Colonel ? ! Hold me ! We got company . - I noticed , Colonel . Time to go . - I understand . Are you OK ? You will not be happy until we all get hurt , right ? Incorrect . Is not it ? I 've already lost two members of my crew . Two good and devoted wife . What am I saying ? Huts was still a child , and we are almost joined her . What are you doing that 's worth all this ? - I can not say . If you have not noticed , we are in a very unusual situation from which we may draw . If you can not get out , you will not complete his mission . I understand that it is a big risk , the price is great , amožda be higher , All I can say is that it is worth it . You have my word . Colonel , this is not enough to fight . We need to know what we are fighting . Sorry , but your word is not enough . That 's all you 'll get . Let 's get out of here . You need to fix the bomber . We can help to rectify the plane refueled . And why should we believe you ? Desperate people take desperate action , Colonel . We want to survive , just like you . - Not . They Canaries multiply . There were only a dozen when we were first attacked . Listen to their shouts , they must have been a hundred . Every lost moment is critical . My people are trained pilots and mechanics , we can help . I said no . Colonel Toler , stupidly stubborn . Murphy , put it there . It could be the difference between life and death . I do not know what you 're talking about . You did not fight against them . You can not trust them . even to help us , not to take them with us ? - Yes . Colonel , I know we 're at war , but we will not go to the wall If we all cooperate , and transportation of the plane is your mission . They want to hijack a plane . - I know , sir . We just need to keep control of the situation . - You took these people to us ? There are seats on the plane , if you help us , have earned their places in it . And I 'd love to see them in prison . - That 's your opinion . In the end , the decision is mine . - I understand . But my point is still valid . The sooner we get off this rock , the better . We could use them . - Well , we will use them . But if you cross the border , I will kill them . I do not promise them off the island , right ? I Miss West , if something goes awry , blood will be on your hands . No , from my point of view . FKO Looking for something , Captain ? Just curious , Colonel . Sorry . What are you looking for ? - We 'll play this game ? Radim what would you do in my situation . I think I found something interesting , if I tell you ? If you ever catch the plane , you will not hesitate to blow your brains out . Do you understand me , Captain ? - You made your point , Colonel . Colonel , commands are corrected and patches should hold . Damage to the engine was repaired , but I can not guarantee how long it will endure . Takashi popped radio from Zero , but we they should be used for a direct connection with ours . The rest is up to the middle of some controls . We should be ready by tomorrow night . Do we have a problem . There is not enough fuel for the escort and bomber . We will reach our destination . There are some gas on the other side of the island . From Araguna . - We 've seen it . It is surrounded by our flying friends . Unfortunately , this is our only alternative . It seems that risk again . There is a chance that get there without attracting their attention . We truck to the edge of the beach . - I 'd like to help . I 'm sure you 'd like , but it is better to leave you under supervision to Murphy . Murphy ? - Yes Sir Please escort the captain to the POW barracks . Captain ? Would you go to g . Murphy ? - Of course , Colonel . Good luck . We start in the morning because you love the night . Let 's hope that by then pospavati . Let 's all but Murphy and navigator to guard the prisoners . You know what we 're dealing with , be quiet and oprezni. - understand . Back in the lion 's den , Betsy . Start ! Go ! Go ! I 'll catch you ! It 's an order ! Come on ! Turn it on ! Move on ! Be careful where you shoot ! - Sorry ! Can a little help , Bets ? Colonel ? - Go Li ! Shit ! For God 's sake ! Step on it ! Whatever happens , just keep going ! Li ! This is for you , huts . The sweetest kiss of my life . They are to escape . - That 's right . I 'd like to think that this Toler you do to help us , not only because of the mission . Even so , it would probably be denied . Toler and Li died we went to the wall . Let us not fail them . Stay in the truck , Betsy . The situation has changed . This time we have the ammunition . Tell your wife to drop the guns and get out of the truck . Shoot , Captain ! Shoot the dogs ! Enough ! Do it now , or both die . Stay there , Bets ! Where 's the colonel and another soldier ? - They 're dead . It 's over . Put the gun down , and no one will harm you . We are not barbarians . We are not Americans . Let her go , or I 'll kill you . Then you will all die . Put the gun down . Okay . I do not play games . Too much is at stake . More than you know , Miss West . It is no longer just a survival issue . I give you one more chance to surrender oružje. - Go to hell . To try to avoid . Now it 's over ! - Whether ? I know that is your mission . - How ? I participated in the project FCO to see if it has succeeded or failed . I do not know what kind of bomb ... - It not ever say that . Extermination . Genocide , killing my people . You must stop ... That 's it , Captain ! Knock it off ! I 'd rather die like a soldier , but from your device . I said , stand down ! On behalf of the spirits of the dead and the legacy of Rioja , I promise , will lead the charge ! It was still dangerous . - He was dying ! I died like a soldier . - You killed him in cold blood . Did not you intend to few days ago , Miss West ? Sorry , I should have let you pulling the trigger , Tell me , what is your mission . What 's in the area bomb , or you 'll never get off this island ! Msلآنسة فست Seized your team ! You do not have such powers . You 're a civilian . And you do not go out without us . What 's in the area for bombs ? - Bomba , Miss West . Do not play with me . This is not just an ordinary bomb . This is the atomic bomb . The most powerful weapon in the world . Take it to a city the size of New York and turn it into ashes . We 'll throw it to Japan and end this war . And if he fails , we 'll throw some more . The real is it ? - Yes . I was on the plane . So this is meant by " genocide " . You will kill thousands ! - Hundreds of thousands ! We 'll save countless American lives . Maks ! - Let her go . All these people ... and the island full of monsters . Time to go . Everything is ready ? Are you sure you want to at night ? These creatures are propagated around the clock . It is no longer important . We 're ready to go , Captain . - You do not need this . Can everyone in the bomber . Betsy and I , accompanied by the best guarantee that we will bomb go from here . After all , it is our mission . We will be safer than in the ZERO B29 . He would have given us a better shelter . This is our best chance , and I want to leave here . You will get to the base 10 , and the Zero , Betsi. - not birini these for us . As long as we stick close to you and mark our position ... we will succeed . - It 's too big a risk . It seems that many reksiramo lately . Remember what happened to the huts ? Last chance to fly with me . I can not , Captain . In addition , I saw how you fly . Okay . It was an honor to serve with you . - The honor was mine . Call me madam again and I 'll rip your head off . Happy landings , girls . Ms. Vest . - Colonel ? They are good soldiers . We should be proud of them . Every minute of every day , sir . Come on , Colonel . Waiting for us the sky . Let 's go girls . Stay close . - I understand . Are you at the point , Colonel ? - I confirm . They come at 6 o 'clock . There must be thousands of them . Stay calm , Betsy , and follow me . We 'll take their numbers . We 're coming , Captain . - Stay in formation , Betsy ! Colonel , you have the honor . - With pleasure , Miss Vest ! This was good . I still come . Let 's get started . - Permission granted . Give ' em hell , girl . We have company in 3 hours , above . - I understand , Colonel . Not ! Damn ! - What happens ? The fourth engine was again on fire , Colonel . Not good . Viki , these things are faster than lightning . Are you OK ? Yes . Damn . New tactics . I 'll be the bait , you follow me ? Admittedly , I follow you ! I just hope that you 're as good as you think I am jesi.-. Do not get too close ! Somehow suddenly too quiet . - I beg your pardon ? Do not scratch it , baby . - I understand . Just a walk in the park . Are you going again ? - Can . How are you doing , girls ? We stick to , boss . But just barely . - Take care . Betsy , change places ! Immediately ! Viki ! - Viki ? Betsy , what 's happening ? Were seized Viki and I were on the tail ! - I am coming . Hold on ! You can not , Vest . - We 'll be back ! We have to continue , a bomb in the first place . Nothing else matters . We 'll be back ! - Continue mission ! It 's an order ! I can not hear you , Colonel ! Too much interference on the line ! Betsy , what 's happening ? Vest , turn around now ! - I will not leave ! She 's done . Nothing can . - Not . He 'll pull through . He 's a good pilot . I will not leave you alone on that island . We 'll be back . Vest , what happened ? Something hit us , check . - I 'm on it ! Ms. Vest ! - Colonel , what hit us ? Bomb was dropped . Climb up as fast as you can ! Colonel , are you all right ? Contact ! God , what have we done ? - Sign me up , Captain . Betsy ? Betsy ! How did you get out from there ? I pulled out of kovita and asked for you . Looks like we missed in the clouds . Probably so . I think I would avoid the explosion I was not far away . It was an ugly firecracker . Captain , I 've never seen anything like it . Never . It looked like the end of the world . - I know . Is there damage to the plane , Betsy ? Are you OK ? I 'm a little banged up , but I 'll be fine . There is no way to land . I 'm gonna have to jump . Stay with me as much as you can . I 'll mark your position and I will send someone to pick you up . I see . Max ... - Yeah , Bets ? I thought , when we return to Tinigan ... to call the plane after the huts , as she wanted . We have to force them to do so . Right ? - Okay . I 'll leave them to paint it . - Agreed . Thank you , Max . It 's all right , Betsy . Just hold on and stay close . Go home .

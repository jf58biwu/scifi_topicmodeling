 Previously on heroes Now we know the meaning of the eclipse . Everyone 's abilities have gone away . You have to get them back . You have to fix hiro . Arthur petrelli erased his memory . Hiro now thinks he 's ten years old . I can 't do this . I 'm sorry . I gotta get outta here . What ? You don 't know me And you don 't know what I 've been through . All he has to do is teleport me To lawrence , kansas . I just didn 't want you to see me like this . Like what ? Like this . No ! Claire ! Why isn 't she healing ? Her ability 's not working . We 're both so - Powerless ? We can 't take what we want anymore . Says who ? Claire . Oh , my god . Arthur is alive ? You 're one of the only people In the world that can stop him . I 'm not going anywhere until I stop samedi . The only way to get this guy to come back home with us Is if we help him stop his brother . We know all about you , senator nathan petrelli . Your father warned us you 'd come . Wait , stop . We have to go back ! My brother won 't stop until we 're dead . I have no abilities , peter ! I 'm completely - Powerless ? Like there 's nothing you can do ? There is nothing I can do . You said all this happened for a reason . To test our resolve . Look , maybe that 's a good thing . Samedi 's abilities are gone too . He 's not invulnerable anymore . That does not make him powerless . His followers think he 's a god . Then I say we make him bleed . We show them he 's not a god . Why did you come here , peter ? To find you . Take you back to stop my father . Do not lie to me . I needed to know I could be a hero Without my powers . Let 's go . Gsw to the shoulder . Bp 110 over 82 . Heart rate 128 . We started an iv . D-5-w . It hurts ! What 's your name , sweetheart ? Claire . Where 's my dad ? He 's on his way . How long ago were you shot ? It just happened . It 's gonna be easier if you don 't lie . I 'm not . Her whole system 's been infected . Either she hasn 't been sick in her whole life Or you 're lying . You don 't want to tell me the truth , You can tell it to the police . Is she gonna be okay ? I don 't know . Do you think it 's permanent ? What-our powers going away or us ? Both , I guess . I don 't know anymore . What if it is ... Permanent . Then you get exactly what you want . And what is it I want ? A chance to reinvent ourselves . Free of powers or perils . Scary . And unexpected . What ? Our powers going away ... Or us ? Come on , let 's go , elle ! Come on ! Who 's doing this ? Who do you think ? That 's right , run ! I want you to be scared ! Just like claire was ! This ends today . Hello My name is Mathan I am your friend There is a lot of power in a name . You shouldn 't give yours away so freely . Some believe that if you know a man 's name , You can possess him . Others believe that names grant great strength . Is that why you call yourself Baron samedi ? So people will worship you like a god ? Is that why you took the title senator ? No ! What are you doing with her ? She 's a restavec . She will be sold . You mean prostitute . It 's not her choice To decide whether she 's happy or sad . Whether she lives or dies . I 'm not gonna let you do this ! You ? You are just a man . And I am the god . So , dr . Suresh , what have you found ? Why aren 't our abilities working ? I have checked every imaginable connection To this eclipse . The possibilities are too numerous to consider . Uh , gravity , electron density . I mean , maybe it really is just a coincidence . Yeah , you keep talking , doc , But all I hear is " blah , blah , blah . " If you gave me just an inch to breathe ! You 're under a lot of stress . I understand . You understand ? You are holding me here against my will And I 'm finally cured ! Being powerless makes me vulnerable . You 're paranoid . Very much so . I think you need proper motivation . Ow . Stop ! I 'm counting on your help , doctor . Sandra , what is it ? Where are you ? Why haven 't you been picking up my calls ? What 's happened ? I took claire to the hospital . I know you told me not to . Is she all right ? No , she is not all right . They 've stabilized her But they say her whole system is infected Like she 's never been sick . You know she is scared . I don 't know what to tell her And I don 't know what to do . Okay , just ... Stay calm . There are asking a lot of questions . They called the police . What am I supposed to tell them ? Tell them what I would tell them . You mean lie . I 'll be right there What 's going on ? What are those ? Leg braces . This is me without my abilities . I have cerebral palsy . But you 're the fastest person in the world . Last year , I could barely move . And then there was an eclipse . And afterwards , I could walk . And then I could run . Then I could run really fast . And now I 'm back to where I started . Read my thoughts if you don 't believe me . I can 't . I can 't . I lost my abilities . Hiro did too . We tried to fight arthur petrelli . He 's punishing us . We don 't know if it was him . I watched him kill your father . It 's right up his alley . Not like I don 't deserve it . Stop saying that . Why ? I 'm a villain . A nemesis , right ? You reap what you sow . How many times do I have to tell you You are a good person ? You don 't know me . You didn 't know about this . You can 't help me And stop pretending like you can . Everything all right ? Matt was just leaving . This gonna give me my powers back ? It 'll help track the changes your body 's going through . You really think I 'm that kind of stupid , doc ? Honestly ... Yeah . I did . " dude , this is so awesome . " We need the new issue of 9th wonders ! You must help us ! We need the new issue of 9th wonders . You must help us . What is this , some kind of practical joke ? What , you think I hired these guys ? I 'm ando masahashi . This is hiro nakamura . Look ! " how did you know what I was gonna say ? " How did you put this in a comic book ? I didn 't . Dude , this is-dude . You must help us understand Why hiro 's lost his power And how to get his memory back . The world is at stake . The answers are in these books . Let 's open up some back issue and find out what 's going on This is not a library . You want if you buy it Then we buy it ! This one too , please Best . Day . Ever . It 's okay . May I help you ? No , we 're fine . Here . He 's gonna call the cops . It doesn 't matter . You 'll be long gone . What are you talking about ? You 've bled a trail of bread crumbs For bennet to follow . He 's gonna be here any minute . We have to split up or else he 's gonna kill us both . No , we have to do this together . That 's the point . With our abilities gone , Bennet is the powerful one . He 's better trained and he will kill you . Maybe I deserve it . Maybe ? No , you 've changed . Don 't give up . Do you have a plan ? Let him follow and set a trap . Numbers are our biggest advantage . Okay , we do this together . Come on . You 're very pretty You want to make me happy ? Right ? Go , go , go , go , go . My sister ... We will save her Run and do not look back You made me bleed I 'm going to do more than that Are you going to kill me , brother ? It is the only way to stop me And then I fought a dinasour , but it really wasn 't a dinasour ... And then I ... I know . I was there . Matt . Hey , I thought you said you were gonna figure out Why our powers aren 't working . We are . In here ? Yeah . Have you found anything ? Actually , I have a theory . Who are these bozos ? In hiro 's origin story , There 's an eclipse . And there 's an eclipse right now . Coincidence ? There was an eclipse On the yamagato roof . The day everything changed . Yeah , but what does that mean to us ? I think that your powers will come back When the eclipse ends . Uh , guys . You might actually be on to something . Look at this . This is a picture of daphne at her house And she 's running . I gotta get back there before she leaves . Thanks , guys . That was matt parkman . Yeah , I 'm matt parkman . Great news . You 're going to get your powers back . Hen we 'll figure out how to get your brain back No . I don 't want to grow up Not now ! Not ever ! I know you can 't understand a word I 'm saying , But there 's something , um , I need to confess . You know , somebody 's supposed to be looking out for you . Somebody 's supposed to be protecting you . Standing up for you . Somebody like me . I had power . I had influence . And I didn 't . And I 'm sorry . Ready to go home ? They found him . They found him . We don 't have much time . We need to make a run for it . No , no , it 'll never work . Look , you - I 'll hold ' em off . You guys escape . Go . Give me that . No , pete - Stop , you 're a senator . You 're important . You need the haitian . I 'm expendable . Have a little faith in me , okay ? Go . Go ! Mom . My mouth is dry . It 's the antibiotics . You 're fighting off an infection . It hurts . Here , take this . Here . If the pain 's too much , press that button . Where 's dad ? He 's on his way . Just try and relax . You 're lying . You 're not very good at it . He will be here . I 'm so stupid . All I wanted was for this ability to go away . And now it 's gone . Mrs. Butler , We need to talk to you . You have got to be brave . I 'm not brave . I 'm just a stupid teenager . I didn 't want to be . I thought I could be more . I 'm sorry I ruined everything . Claire , don 't talk like that . It hurts . It hurts so much . Claire ? Claire ! Help ! Help ! Help ! We need help now ! She 's coding . Get me a crash cart . Bring another liter . Oh , god . He 's here . This isn 't good . It 's too open . Okay , come on . We 'll take this down . It 'll buy us some time . Wait , what are you doing ? Good-bye , elle . Gabriel , no ! Gabriel ! No ! Gabriel , no ! She 's gone into septic shock . Crack the chest . I get it , you 're in control . The agent . The killer . And I 'm defenseless . What if claire could see you now ? Shut up ! We 're losing her ! Paddles ! Paddles ready . Charge . Clear ! Clear ! Clear ! No . Poor gabriel . You always wanted to be special . Look at you now . No . You 're nobody . Mom . We gotta get you outta here . Daphne ? Mr. Millbrook ? What happened ? She 's gone . Gone where ? I don 't know . No note . No good-bye . Just gone ... Again . Uh , you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . It 's all my fault . He 's been so good to me . When she started walking , I thought it was just ... A fluke . Maybe if I 'd have done more She would 've stayed . Don 't think that . I gotta go . I never should have stolen the formula for arthur . So stupid . Now everything 's screwed up . Matt 's dad is dead . I brought them all together . I 'm as bad as they are . Horrible person . You got your ability back . Well , you could be anywhere in the world right now . What are you still doing here ? I came to talk to ray . Does ray talk back ? I made him when I was 13 . This corn is my dad 's livelihood . And one fall , the birds were feasting on it . We were losing the crop . Then along came ray . He saved the field . No . You did . Life just took a lot from you . You were trying to take something back . I get that . We 're all flawed . Powers or no powers . But when it counts , you 're a good person . I know it and you know that I know it . So you forgive me ? I 'm not the one you need to ask forgiveness from . You came here for a reason . To set something right . Go do it , speedy . Stop firing Thanks for coming back . You got it . You defeated my men But , they are just men ... And I 'm a God You should 've stopped me when you had the chance Now ... They will all suffer ! You 're not going to hurt anyone else This isn 't your fight . You made it my fight . Use your ability . Turn his off . I have a shot ! This is my responsibility . Don 't do this You still love me I 'm still your brother That has no power over me Maya , it 's me , mohinder . Just a minute . Mohinder You gotta get him out Of my bathroom , man . What is his problem ? He doesn 't want to grow up . Everyone has to grow up ! Dude ! You must grow up You guys didn 't grow up He says you guys didn 't grow up . You read comic books and eat junk food If you were hiro - You 're not , but if you were , You would know that saving the world Comes before everything else . Look what happens when I try He says , " look what happens when I try . " My father dead " my father 's dead . " Why bother being a hero " why bother being a hero ? " Because you give people hope . Anybody . Even lowly office drone can make a difference . You don 't have to be a billionaire like batman Or an alien like superman . You just have to believe . I , uh , thought you didn 't believe in any of this . I don 't . Thank you . This is really weird . Did you find something ? Issue one of 9th wonders . Yeah , this is the issue where , uh , hiro 's dad Gives the baby claire to her father , Makes him swear to protect her . You were there . That 's the first and only time That claire bennet and hiro nakamura met . What 's he saying That 's not the only time . No , no , kirby plaza doesn 't count . They never actually even talked . Maybe they did . Look at this . In the greenhouse . That 's claire , And that 's hiro Hiding behind the ferns . And hiro 's wearing the same clothes he is now . I think hiro has to take claire here To get his memory back . You have to take Claire here to get your memory back How do I find claire How does he find claire ? I must go there Right now Wait ! Hiro ! Best-day-ever . Claire bear . You okay ? I needed you And you weren 't there again . I 'm sorry . There was something I had to do . There 's always something you have to do . Work 's just more important . No . Listen . On the day I was assigned to protect you - That 's right . I 'm just an assignment . Claire , you know that 's not true . I died ! But I guess that 's just old news to you , isn 't it ? You died ? When ? Why does it matter ? It matters . What is it ? What 's wrong ? Where 's your mother ? She 's with us . Stay back ! Ahh ! We 're taking claire with us . That 's what we came for in the first place . You following daddy 's orders now ? You trying to be a good boy ? Not a good boy . Not exactly . Something else . Something more like ... Like you . Home , family . But not afraid to do the job I have to do . Stop ! Look , I will go with you , okay ? Just please leave him alone . I think this game of cat and mouse is over . They 're not your parents . What are you talking about . They 're manipulating you . Arthur and angela . I 've read your files , gabriel . You 're not their son . They 're just leveraging your mommy issues To turn you into their weapon . He 's lying . Don 't let him get inside your head . You know exactly who he is Because you helped create him . And you can 't undo that . Not ever . You really think you two Could have a normal life ? He killed your father , elle . No ! Bad man What the hell ? Save the cheerleader ... Hey . We got our abilities back . Where 's hiro ? He 's gone . Gone where ? No one knows . Okay , uh , Let 's look in one of your comic books . No , that well is dry . Isaac mendez is dead . This is the last posthumous issue . But it 's not the last story . What do you mean ? There 's a legend I heard from a guy at a convention Who heard it from a dude who heard it from another dude That one more 9th wonders story exists . Where ? The day that he died , Isaac mendez bequeathed his sketch book To a humble bike messenger . You find that messenger , You find your story . I 'll bring the girls back to their parents . Thank you for what you did . Nobody should ever have to make the sacrifice You made today . You okay ? Yeah . Pete , you 've always made your own decisions . I haven 't agreed with all of them , But they 've always come from your heart . I respect that . And I 'm sorry about - Just ... Thank you . It means a lot . I 'm going to pinehurst . To dad ? It 's got nothing to do with dad . Look , I 'm never gonna forgive him for what he did to us . But his idea , giving people abilities , The right people - Is wrong . It 's not wrong , pete . It 's so right . You saw what one man with unstoppable powers Nearly did to this country . Yeah , but we stopped him . We didn 't do anything . He did because he still had power . And that was just one village . What about the whole world ? Somalia , darfur , bosnia , the middle east . Murder , genocide . Don 't we have an obligation to try and stop it ? Yes , we do , but not like this . Then how ? Pinehurst has a way , pete . It 's not perfect . Not yet . But if we don 't try and stop What 's happening in the world , Then we 're just as guilty As the people who are committing the crime . Nathan . Pete , I can 't live with that . Nathan , you - Call tk at the embassy . He 'll help you get home . Nathan , you can 't do this ! I 'm sorry pete I think this eclipse showed us all Exactly who we are . Desperate . Angry . And weak . Are you ready to get back to work ? Look at me . Where else could I go ? We 'll find a cure . But that monster inside of you , That 's something you 're gonna have to take care All by yourself What was that ? Hiro nakamura . Strange day . Was bennet lying about my parents ? Of course he was . He 's bennet . He seemed to think you knew something about it . He 's just trying to mess with you . Sit down . I 've been thinking . About what ? What you said about finding ourselves free of parents . Our powers . What about it ? You were wrong . Nobody ever really changes . You did . I saw you . That was temporary . And then I got my powers back . And I understand now . And I 'm never gonna change . Neither are you because We 're both just damaged goods . You 're hurting me . I know . What did you do ? What the hell is going on ? Dad ? " i don 't think I 'd be a very good father . " " once again , not a request . " " don 't get too close . " Holy sh - Manhattan £ ¬ 16 years ago

 Come in , Base . This is Jake . Do you copy ? This is Base . Copy . Hey , Andrea , listen . We caught another Asian pit viper . It 's a mean bastard too . Well , that 's good . Bring it in , but be very careful , okay ? Actually , I was considering taking it out for dinner . And you 'll be the dinner . No kidding . I 'm on my way . Jake , out . Out . Guys , what 's going on ? Please , can you get it out of there ? Okay , listen . There 's a big freakin ' rattler that 's loose on the island here . And I personally don 't wanna run into her . You with me ? That 's good . Okay . Move . What- - Oh , my- - We were successful , Major . The snake I brought here from your lab was able to mate with an indigenous pit viper . I received your findings , Doctor , and you were right . Those snakes ' chromosomes have mutated . The cells are loaded with radioactive isotopes . So , frankly , I don 't know how the babies are still alive . Major , those diamondback babies are not only alive ... but they 've nearly tripled in size in the past week . And they 've become more aggressive . I 've never seen anything like it , sir . If they keep growing , we might have a serious problem on our hands . Do you think the mutation might have anything to do ... with the natural radiation from the volcanic rock ? It 's possible . But I took a look at some classified files . Now , the Chinese used the waters around that island for bomb tests back in the ' 60s . We were never able to confirm that they were nuclear , but that could be the culprit . - How 's the mother ? - She 's still loose . And God only knows how big she 's become by now . Enter . - Commander James O 'Neill reporting , sir . - At ease . Take a load off , Jim . I 've , uh , read the transcripts from the court inquiry . Do you know that they 're considering a forced retirement ? I put in for it , sir . 20 years- - it seems like time . Well , do you know that Admiral Mueller ... is considering a dishonorable discharge ? And he can press a full court-martial if he wants to . I understand . I 've known you a long time , Jim . You 're a good officer . What really did happen on that submarine ? Sir , the boat was fresh out of the shipyard . We were on sea trials . Admiral Mueller wanted to push it beyond its tactical specs . I felt his orders endangered my men . I didn 't wanna put their lives at risk ... so that he could brag to his buddies at the Pentagon about his new toy . You bruised his ego . But you also broke the chain of command . That 's what keeps us together . Without it , we 're sunk . Yes , sir . No excuses , sir . I didn 't , uh , call you in here for a lecture , Jim . I think I 've found a way out of this mess . A mission has crossed my desk , and you would be perfect for it . A mission , sir ? One of our older subs , the U.S.S. Santa Mira ... has been decommissioned and sold to the Taiwanese navy . It 's been involved in research for the last 10 years ... and a naval museum . But some bean counter in Washington has deemed it too expensive to maintain . So they want it delivered to Taipei by next week . I would be the delivery driver ? I have got them to agree to drop all the proceedings ... and offer you full retirement benefits ... if you take this last mission . When do I leave , sir ? You 'll be on the over night to Okinawa . I know it 's short notice . They 're giving you a skeleton crew ... most of them fresh out of submarine school . And your X.O. is , um , Lieutenant Commander Houston Davies . He 's a bit green , but he did do one tour of duty in the Persian Gulf . Nobody else was available to babysit ? I 'm trying to do you a favor , Jim . I do believe this is your only way out of this mess . If it 's possible , sir , I 'd like to have Eddie Boudreau as chief of the boat . Yeah . I anticipated that . I already drew up the orders . Shipped him out here 3 nights ago from San Diego . I appreciate it , sir . Jim . I don 't want you to end 20 years on a bad note . I think this will work out okay . It 'll be smooth sailing . - Good luck . Godspeed . - Thank you , sir . What happened , Jake ? It was horrible . The snake got loose . Bit the trapper on the arm . Wouldn 't let go . Blood started coming out of everywhere . - It even turned on me . - Where 's the trapper that got bit ? - I don 't know . - You don 't know ? You gave him the antivenom , right ? No . He ran into the jungle . Actually , they both did . I wasn 't about to go after them with that snake on the path . So there 's a guy that 's out there that 's possibly dying ... and we don 't know where he is ? - Jake , I told you to be careful . - I was careful . He wasn 't . Listen , Andrea . I 'm not the expert here . You with me ? Okay ? These things- - they got me a little freaked . Okay , I need you to go out there and find that guy . What ? Look , he ran towards the village . And if he 's alive , I 'm sure they 'll bring him back . But , Andrea , I am not going after him . Let me ask you a question , Jake . Why didn 't you just stay at your research job ? - Why ? - Yeah . Why ? Well , okay , then , because the army had sold me on a promise ... that I 'd be traveling to paradise . That sounded a lot better than being stuck in a research lab in New Mexico . You know , it looks like , uh ... Powder Puff and Blueberry here need a bigger cage . It 's Cream Puff and Strawberry . And you do realize they 're about 5 times bigger than they were a week ago ? - I think that 's a bit of an exaggeration . - Says you . Jake , I want you to put the antivenom back on the racks , including yours . Hey , I know the drill . I broke ' em all , Andrea . I 'm sorry . These things got me freaked . It 's not my fault . I 'm so sorry . These things are just freaking me out . And then there were 2 . - Right . - Sir . - COB , you ready ? - We 're good . All right , Lozano , how we doing ? - We 're ready to get underway , sir . - Good . We got about a half hour . Attention on deck ! At ease , gentlemen . Good morning . - Good morning , Captain . - I have the conn . Captain has the conn . Lieutenant Commander Houston Davies , sir . Mr. Davies . All crew are present and accounted for , Captain . Very well . Mr. Davies , prepare to get under way . Getting underway , Captain . This is the X.O. Prepare to get underway . X.O. , I 'll let you take her through the channel . Sir ? It 's just like backing out of the garage at home . If you do well , I might even let you take her for a spell . Thank you , Captain . I 'll do my best . You heard the captain . Let 's get underway . Good job , Mr. Davies . I 'll take her from here . Thank you , Captain . I understand . Approaching dive point , Captain . Dive Officer , submerge the ship . Submerging ship , Captain . Dive ! Dive ! Dive ! Make your depth 1-6-0 feet . Diving to 1-6-0 feet . Present depth , 5-0 feet . Deck 's awash . - All vents open . - All vents open . 7-0 feet . - Scope 's under . - All ahead full . Course 1-1-0 . Course 1-1-0 , Captain . Present depth , 100 feet . Smooth sailing from here on out , gentlemen . They don 't need guys like me around anymore . Brings back a lot of memories , doesn 't it , Captain ? Yeah . Yeah , it does , COB . I even tried to get us some real torpedoes . My guy in Acquisitions wouldn 't budge . No live weapons for a decommissioned boat . Just these duds , huh ? Yeah , well , up till 3 months ago , this was a museum . I guess that 's why they put us old dinosaurs on here . Sir , I just want you to know that I heard about your circumstances . If I was in your position , I would have made the same decision . That was the only time in my career I ever disobeyed a direct order . My gut said they were wrong . They saw it different . Like I said , COB ... they don 't need guys like me around anymore . Using our satellites along with ground intel ... we 've learned of a massive deployment of Chinese navy in the East China Sea . These are the largest sea maneuvers in over a decade . They plan an amphibious landing of commandos ... on the island of Manku , located here . The army currently has 2 research scientists stationed there . Major Drake , what is the army doing with 2 scientists on Manku Island ? Mr. Secretary , we are studying the indigenous snake population ... as part of our bio-weapons research project . This toxic snake venom could be the key to creating a vaccine ... that could protect our troops from a wide variety of nerve agents , including sarin gas . I can 't stress enough the importance of this research to counter the terrorist threat . You can only imagine if this research fell into the hands of the Chinese . Gentlemen , it 's vital that we protect our assets on this island . Captain Rogers , sounds like we need to mount a rescue mission . Yes , sir . We still have time . Our intelligence is reporting ... that the Chinese naval maneuvers won 't begin for another 3 days . We have ships in that area ? - Carrier groups from Japan ? Fly in a chopper ? - Unfortunately , no , sir . The nearest ship is 5 days away ... and the island is too far to be reached by helicopter . - Do you have any ideas , Captain Rogers ? - Yes , Mr. Secretary . I do . It 's a submarine . The U.S.S. Santa Mira . The Santa Mira recently was decommissioned and sold to Taiwan . Yes , sir , but they 've changed course now . It 'll be about a day from Manku Island . They can pick up the scientists and still be 2 days distance when the maneuvers start . - You think it can be done ? - Our options are limited , sir . I think this is our only hope . Captain , I want you to send a coded message , high priority , to the U.S.S. Santa Mira ... giving them orders to evacuate those scientists immediately . Yes , sir . I want that submarine to get whatever it needs . Am I clear ? - Yes , sir . - Yes , sir . I 'll brief the president . Gentlemen , be advised . These are orders from the Pentagon . Looks like we have a real mission on our hands . They want us to evacuate 2 scientists from Manku Island tomorrow morning . High priority status . - Planesman , how far is Manku Island ? - 200 miles , sir . If we change course right now and keep a steady 20 knots , we can be there by 7 : 00 am . Do they know we 're not a rescue ship ? Mr. Davies , set a direct course for Manku Island . Yes , sir . - We have any firearms on board ? - Just a small-arms kit . - 6 .45s , 2 clips each . - You think we 're gonna see some action ? I don 't know what to expect on an island , Mr. Davies ... but if we 're going in , we 're going prepared . Helm , left rudder , 30 degrees . All ahead , 20 knots . Course 1-9-0 . - Hey . - Hey . So , what 's the rush ? Is there a typhoon on the way or something ? The major didn 't say . He just said to pack up everything ... get our research together and be ready to go by morning . - Be ready ? - Yeah . They 're sending a submarine for us . A submarine ? Wow . What about our little friends ? He said he just wants us to bring 4 snakes- - 2 males and 2 females . How about these monsters ? We 're gonna have to destroy ' em . We can 't take ' em with us , and they 're too dangerous to let loose . They 're growing so rapidly . We just don 't know enough about the mutation . What about the mother ? She 's still out there somewhere . I don 't know . She might be dead due to a shortened life span . I can 't help but believe that the accelerated growth ... is a by-product of an increased metabolism . The fast die young , right ? I don 't know . We haven 't seen her in a while . I 'm just hoping . Hey , Andrea . Listen . These snakes are very , very rare . I think they could be worth a fortune . - I thought you hated snakes . - Oh , I do . I do . But , I see an opportunity to make some money on this endeavor . I think I could fetch some serious cash on these on the open market . What do you say we take a few extras home with us ? Because we have orders . 4 snakes . No more , no less . We got to pack up all this equipment . It 's gonna be a long night . I want you to take the diamondbacks and gas ' em . I 'm gonna go back to the main cabin and pack up all my research . Can you handle that ? Gas ' em ? It 'd be my pleasure . Okay . How would the 2 of you like to take a nice , long sea voyage ? COB . Be careful . We will be , sir . Piece of cake . Okay . Nice and easy . You 're okay . Get inside there with all your little buddies . You 'll be just fine . Okay . Okay . No snake left behind . That 's great . Sleep tight , guys . I 'm counting on it . - Hey , Jake , we ready to go ? - Oh , we are ready to rock and roll . - All right . Did you release the snakes ? - All but 4 . - Just what the doctor ordered , right ? - Did you gas the 2 big ones ? - Yes , ma 'am . - All right . There 's hope for you yet . - Double-check the list , make sure we have everything . - Okay . No problem . Okay , good . And remember , they can 't know what 's on board . It 's classified . - Okay . - Okay . So what do you think 's going down ? - I don 't know . - I 'm sure these guys do . They look pretty serious , don 't they ? Hey , guys . Welcome to FantasyIsland . You must be , uh , Dr. Swanson . Well , actually , I 'm not . I 'm her assistant , Jake Goldin . She 's Dr. Swanson . Andrea . Dr. Andrea Swanson . Chief of the Boat Boudreau , U.S.S. Santa Mira . My men can help you with any equipment you need to move . Okay , great . Jake , show ' em what we have . - Okay . You got it . - Take this . Besides this , we got a few more back here . Come on . Chief , what 's going on ? Ma 'am , all I know is that we 've been given orders to evacuate the both of you . So I do suggest we get started . This way . Oh , my God . Smitty , get me Admiral Wallace immediately . Priority call . Captain . We 're about to be surrounded ... by the largest Chinese naval maneuvers in 10 years . It was supposed to start 3 days from now . Washington blames bad intel . No surprise there , huh ? How do we deal with 2 complete Chinese battle groups ? Very quietly , Mr. Davies . Captain , we 're out here all alone without any defense . - It could get nasty . - Then we 're just gonna have to keep it friendly . We 're lucky . This old sub runs pretty quiet when she 's on the electric motors . Gentlemen , I 'm gonna need you focused . I 'm gonna need the best out of this young crew , focused and at attention . I 'll keep on ' em , sir . - COB ? - No problems , Captain . Piece of cake . ComSubPac just notified us . We 're about to be in some Chinese naval maneuvers . Get ' em on board . Prepare to get underway immediately . Aye , sir . Coming in . Permission to come aboard , please , Captain , sir . - Dr. Swanson ? - Hi . Actually , no , I 'm not . Uh , though we look alike . Hi . Dr. Andrea Swanson . Commander James O 'Neill . Welcome aboard , Doctor . I 'm sorry . We just didn 't expect- - A woman . - We don 't often have them on board . - I understand . X.O. , get their gear stowed and prepare to get underway . Yes , Captain . This way , please . Thank you . Captain , I got a bad feeling about this . - Slow , man . Slow . - I know . Okay . Oh ! - Hey , easy . - I know . Hey , you think anything inside broke ? We could take a look , but it 's classified material . Maybe just a peek ? Come on . You better just leave it alone . Put it over there . Next ! Damn , this is heavy . - This will be your cabin , ma 'am . - Thank you . Sir , you have to bunk with the other sailors . - Where are they storing our equipment ? - Torpedo Room . It 'll be safe there , ma 'am . Let 's get your bag , Mr. Goldin . Okay . Hey . You think they got room service ? Oh , wow . Just like summer camp , right ? Fortunately , we have one bunk available . If you have any questions , feel free to ask . Yeah . Yeah . Look , I got a question . I am starving . Where would I find something to eat ? We have the crew 's mess . Settle in , Mr. Goldin . " Settle in , Mr. Goldin . " Okay . This is nice . Nice . Captain . Broadband contact . 4,000 yards off our port side ... and closing . Bearing 1-5-0 . Designate Sierra 10 . What is it ? I can 't be sure . My best guess it 's a missile frigate . One of the new Chinese naval boats , maybe a Jin-Q class . And I bet they 're just aching to use one of those missiles too . Yeah , they can 't possibly detect us from that distance . Let 's not give ' em any chance . Dive Officer , take it down to 200 feet , 20 degrees on the down bubble . Aye , Captain . 200 feet , 20 degrees down bubble . Okay . Captain . We 've got a Chinese missile frigate 3,500 yards off our port side ... - and closing . - Are they on to us ? Not yet . I 'm taking her down to 200 feet . Conn , sick bay . Sick bay , conn . Captain , this is Corpsman Kelso . You better get down here right away , sir . - What is it ? - Captain , I 've got a man down here . He 's in pretty bad shape , sir . I 'm on my way . X.O. , level off at 200 feet . Proceed on a course bearing 2-1-0 , 10 knots . - X.O. has the conn . - X.O. has the conn . Captain . I was able to stabilize him ... but his pulse and breathing are weak . Something 's attacking his nervous system . - A virus ? - I don 't know . He 's showing signs of hemorrhagic fever , but I can 't be sure without blood tests ... and I just don 't have the proper equipment to do a diagnosis . - COB , was he on the island with you ? - Yes , Captain . Did he show any signs of illness ? No , sir . Everyone was fine as far as I could tell . - How about you ? You all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . - What about malaria ? - Again , sir ... I 'd be guessing at this point . I need to do tests . All they gave me down here were aspirin , Band-Aids and diarrhea pills . Do we need a quarantine ? - I don 't know . - Well , I need to know . If there 's an outbreak on this ship , we 're 500 miles from the nearest port . That sounds like a lot of trouble to me . Captain , a virus takes 24 hours to incubate . That means he could have contracted it before he went ashore ... or maybe it 's some fast-acting bug from the island that we don 't know about . At this point , I would monitor everyone who went ashore . If they show signs , then we 'll need to quarantine . I 'll check on the other sailor , see if he 's okay . Good . Let me know the minute this changes . Yes , sir . - Jake . - Thank you . So how 's the blue plate special ? Fine . So , it was just the two of you on that island , huh ? Well , there were a few locals in a village nearby , but , uh , yeah . Wow ! How did you swing that job ? I was recruited by the army to do research actually . What kind of research ? Female anatomy ? That 's cute . No , it 's classified . So how did you swing this job ? You need money to finish college or something ? - Sailor Rhodes , you feeling okay ? - Fine , Chief . What 's wrong ? Covacek ? - Mr. Goldin ? - Never better . - You , chef ? - Fine . What 's up ? Another sailor went to the island and got real sick . Now he 's in a coma . - You guys let me know if anything changes , okay ? - Okay , Chief . We found a trap when we landed on the island . It was blood on the outside . What were you guys trying to catch ? It 's classified . Douche bag . - Yes , Captain . - Are you feeling okay , Doctor ? Yes , I 'm fine . Why do you ask ? One of the men who went ashore , he 's come down with something . I think it 's best if you and Mr. Goldin stay in your quarters ... - till we know what 's going on . - Okay . - Do you want me to take a look at him ? - No . No . The less people exposed , the better off we 'll be . Do you mind if I take a shower ? You do have a shower on board , right ? It 's small , but it works . Okay , good . I mean , as long as it has hot water . We don 't have any hot water on the island . You 're sure that , uh , you 're feeling okay ? I 'm fine , Captain . - You look a little flushed . - Captain to the conn . Uh , this is the captain . I 'll be right there . Captain . We 've got company . - Sierra 10 ? - No , sir . They 've moved off . I 'm picking up 4 more ships . Designate Sierra 11 through 14 , all 1,500 yards off our starboard side ... bearing 0-9-5 . - Same as before ? - Yes , sir . Missile frigates . Captain , that puts them into a direct course between us and Okinawa . We 're in international waters . Naval protocol states they have to declare- - I don 't wanna press the issue , Mr. Davies . Pop up beside some kind of live-fire exercise . - Should we plot an alternate course ? - Yes . We 're gonna turn back into Chinese coastal waters . Gonna stay low , give us someplace to hide down there . Get to here , pop back up to Okinawa . I wanna stay as far from them as we can . Captain , your new course brings us directly into the Chinese coastal military zone . How is that helping our situa- - International maritime law does not recognize the zone as being legitimate , Mr Davies . - My options are limited . - The manual states that operation- - I don 't need a lecture on the manual . Operational orders are fluid when there 's a real threat to the mission . - It 's my call . - Yes , sir . Lozano , you let me know the second they start ground-bouncing that sonar . - Yes , sir . - Steady as she goes . Aye , aye , Captain . Oh , sorry , ma 'am . Sorry . - Don 't you knock ? - Uh , no , ma 'am . It 's usually just us guys on board . We don 't , uh- - We don 't knock . I know . It 's a submarine thing . - Yes , ma 'am . - Yeah . Okay . - Carry on . - Thank you . Women on a submarine . That just isn 't natural . Captain to sick bay . Captain to sick bay . This is the captain . I 'm on the way . Let 's go . - What in the hell are we up against here ? - Captain , I still don 't know . Well , you better get me some damn answers fast before we lose anymore men . - Does he have the same symptoms ? - Yes , but he didn 't go ashore . And look at this . Puncture wounds , like from some kind of bite . And I examined the other sailor . He 's got the marks on him too . So this is a reaction to a bite ? What could bite them down here ? I don 't know . That 's the mystery . Maybe we 've brought something on board . Like what , some kind of spider ? We don 't know what was in that jungle , sir . Something could have stowed away in their equipment without us knowing . All right . Check it out and get back to me . Be careful . Don 't worry . I 'm on it , sir . - I need some answers . - I 'm working every angle , Captain . No . This isn 't happening . Oh , God . Oh , God . Easy there , Mr. Goldin . Where you going ? I 'm just gonna run some tests on this equipment . - What 's in the box ? - Computers . And it 's classified . Clumsy me . I really wouldn 't wanna drop this . This is very , - very sensitive equipment . - Looks heavy too . It is very heavy . We concern you might have brought something on board without knowing . - Like what ? - That 's what we 're trying to figure out . 2 of our men have suffered bites , and one is dead . Oh , my God . That- - That 's terrible . Let me know if there 's anything I can do to help . Well , if you see anything , you let us know immediately . Okay ? Yeah , you got it . Um , carry on . Hey . What 's in the box ? Uh , classified equipment . You sure you didn 't bring that sickness on board ? What ? What ? I 'm a doctor , okay ? I 'd know . You 're a doctor , huh ? That 's funny . I asked , and I heard you 're just the assistant . Why should I believe anything you have to say ? Well , you don 't have to . That 's not my problem . Okay . It 's open . - Hey . - Hey . What 's going on , Jake ? Okay , look , I 'm just gonna come right out and tell you . The snakes are out . What do you mean out ? The container was open , and it was empty . The snakes are loose . - Oh , my God . - One of the sailors is already dead , Andrea . - How did they get out , Jake ? - I don 't know . I don 't know . Someone must have opened the container ... 'cause I know I secured it before we left the island . Okay . We have to notify the captain . Andrea , you got to tell me we 're not gonna get in trouble for someone else 's mistake . - I mean , this wasn 't our fault . - Jake , someone died because of those snakes . They could be anywhere on this submarine , and everyone is a potential victim . The biggest problem that we have right now ... is finding 4 snakes on a submarine ... when there 's a thousand places for them to hide . Okay , well , there 's another problem right there , okay ? There 's--There 's a few more than 4 . What did you do ? Tell me you didn 't . Come on , Andrea . So I brought on a few more snakes than I should 've . Big deal . Okay ? Big deal . It 's not my fault that some idiot sailor opened up the container , right ? How many snakes did we take on board with us ? All of 'em . - All of them ? - Yeah . - So there are 20 snakes on board with us ? - Yes , ma 'am . What about the 2 big ones ? Yes . Andrea , wait a minute . Hey , don 't worry about those 2 . - They 're still perfectly secure at this time . - You 're such an idiot . Hey . Andrea ! Oh , geez . 1-8-0 feet . 20 degrees left rudder . Course 2-5-0 , 10 knots . 20 degrees left rudder . Course 2-5-0 , 10 knots . What did you find , Mr. Davies ? Something left this in the torpedo room . See if Dr. Swanson can analyze that . Sierra 12 and 13 are now 100 yards off our starboard side . Whoa ! We got splash in the water ! Repeat . We have a splash in the water . Depth charge on its way . - Depth charge . - 45 degrees left rudder . Course 2-5-0 ! Give me everything she 's got ! Everything she 's got , Captain . This is the captain ! Depth charge in the water ! Prepare for impact ! Repeat ! Prepare for impact ! Oh , my God . Everybody good ? COB , get us the hell out of here ! Captain , we 've lost propulsion . Damage Control , report ! Conn , Engine Room . We lost power to the turbine generators . - The backup systems are not responding . - Depth , 200 feet . Captain , we 're at 5 knots and slowing . We 're gonna be dead in the water in 5 minutes . Engine Room , this is the conn . I need those turbines now . I 'm working on it , Captain . - Ma 'am , you 're not allowed in- - - I need to speak with the Captain . - What is it , Doctor ? - We 've got snakes on board , and they 're loose . Snakes ? You brought snakes onto this submarine ? - They were part of our classified research . - I don 't care . I hate snakes . You brought them on here without telling me . - I had my orders . - I don 't care about your orders . I got a dead sailor . I got another one barely hanging on . And upstairs , I got the Chinese navy trying to sink this ship . Those snakes were in an airtight container . One of your men must have opened it . Do you realize you 've compromised everyone on this submarine , Doctor ? Those snakes only attack if they 're provoked . - How many ? - 20 . I 've got 2 vials of antivenom ... but there 's no guarantee it 'll work . Get the antivenom to the corpsman in sick bay . Go . I 'll meet you there . Attention . This is the captain . Be advised . We have 20 highly venomous snakes on board . Repeat . 20 highly venomous snakes . Their bite is toxic . Do not engage . Report all incidents of contact to the conn . Where are they , Lozano ? 12 and 13 are still 100 yards off our starboard side . Send a message to ComSubPac in Pearl . I wish I could , sir . I 'm off-line . All communications are down right now . Something must have happened in that attack . - Let me know . - I 'm on it , sir . Hey . We 're gonna die down here , aren 't we ? I don 't wanna die at the bottom of the ocean . I really don 't wanna die down here . Oh , shut up , Jake . - What are you doing with the antivenom ? - Taking it to sick bay . Captain Rogers , have they reported in yet ? No , sir . Not since the evacuation . This is their last known location . And these are the Chinese vessels we 've been tracking ? Yes , sir . The maneuvers are underway . They 're right in the middle of the action . I sent ' em into harm 's way . - Looks like it , sir . - God help ' em . I 'll keep trying to contact ' em , sir . You do that , Captain Rogers , and you let me know the moment they reply . Engine Room , this is the captain . We need that generator . I 'm working on it , Captain . I 'm doing the best I can . X.O. , what 's our status ? Captain , Sierra 12 and 13 now 1,500 yards off our starboard side . They 're circling and might be headed back for another run . - Soon as we have propulsion , get us out of here . - Aye , aye , Captain . The proteins in the venom are a neurotoxin , Captain . They attack the muscle tissues in the body . They had the exact symptoms of snake bite ... but I could not diagnose it in time . I 've got the antivenom , Captain . It 's too late ... for him . Maybe we can use it to save someone else . You are aware that there 's no guarantee that the antivenom will work ? - There 's always a chance of an anaphylactic reaction . - In English , Doctor . It 's the body 's allergic reaction to the antivenom . In other words , the antivenom is just as dangerous as the snakebite , Captain . - That 's right . - Well . We don 't have another choice , do we , Dr. Swanson ? COB , get the X.O. Meet me in the torpedo room in 10 minutes . - Yes , sir . - You 'll come with me . I need you to brief 'em on what we 're up against . Yes , sir . Gentlemen . We have 20 highly venomous snakes on board . All the snakes from the island are deadly . - Most of them are pit vipers . - Oh , that 's terrific , Doctor . How do we treat a snakebite ? Well , if you receive a snakebite , try to stay calm . Don 't move around a lot . Try to keep the bite ... lower than the heart to slow the blood circulation . You can wash it out , but don 't ice it . Don 't use a tourniquet . - And never cut open the wound . - Don 't forget a shot of antivenom . Well , we can 't really rely on the antivenom . I only have 2 vials ... and that 's good for about 2 or 3 bites . How long until the venom takes effect ? That depends on how toxic the snake is . Usually , within about 5 minutes , your nervous system shuts down . You 'll experience a seizure . Then your lungs collapse and fill with fluid , and then you die . That sounds like a lot of fun . So , how do you suggest we deal with these snakes ? Leave the snakes alone . I know you may not believe this ... but snakes only attack if they 're provoked . Right now , they 're probably searching for some place warm . They-They naturally gravitate towards warm places . I wanna be proactive here . I don 't wanna give those snakes the element of surprise anymore . We check every compartment on this sub . You brief your men as to what to expect , and let 's be very safe out there . Dismissed . I wanna help , Captain . What can I do ? Well , since you 're the expert , you can go with Boudreau , help him spread the word . Contain them if you can . If you can 't , kill everyone . Yes , Captain . Ma 'am . Follow me . Captain , I 'm sorry about your men . I never meant for any of this to happen . Those snakes should never have been brought on board my sub , not without telling me . I don 't care what your orders were . Captain to the conn . Captain to the conn . We have propulsion . This is the captain . Ahead full 10 knots . Course bearing 2-5-0 . I 'm on the way . What is it , Lozano ? Sir , Sierra 12 and 13 are now 2,000 yards and moving away . The bad news is I 'm tracking an unknown contact . Designate Sierra 15 . It 's now 3,000 yards ... and our baffle 's bearing 2-5-0 . - What is it ? - It 's a submarine , sir . Unfortunately , naval command didn 't supply us with an acoustic signature manual . - So I can only guess at what class . - What 's your best guess ? A Chinese Han class attack submarine . I 'm really certain . I 'm sure their passive sonar 's picked up something . But they 're probably not sure , so they 're hunting . Han class ? - We don 't stand a chance , Captain . - I don 't know , Mr. Davies . A submarine 's only as good as its captain . Keep on her , Lozano . If she changes speed or course , I need to know . Yes , sir . What 's our communication status ? Well , I fixed the cables , but now there 's a software glitch . I 'm working on it , sir . Should we switch to silent running ? Good choice , Mr. Davies . If they go to active sonar ... we 're gonna light up like a Christmas tree . I don 't wanna take any chances . Attention . This is the captain . Rig the ship for silent running . Repeat . Silent running . Remain at O-spec-bravo till further notice . That is all . Our only hope is to run the electric motors ... get lost in some noisy sea traffic . Cat and mouse from here on out , Mr. Davies . Unfortunately , we 're the mouse , sir . We 're gonna start shutting down the blowers to the entire boat . It 's gonna get mighty cold down here in no time . Why are you doing that , Chief ? Because we 're silent running . Can 't afford any extra noise when there 's a hostile in the area . These blowers make a hell of a lot of noise . You know that the cold is gonna slow the snakes down ... and make ' em harder to find , right ? We don 't have a choice , ma 'am . Hopefully , they 'll keep to themselves till we reach Okinawa . Then maybe we can send in a mongoose . Ah , yes . Hey . - What are you doing in here ? - I 'm looking for some aspirin . I 've got a splitting ' headache . Next time , ask . No one 's allowed in here without my permission . Yeah , sure . I 'm sorry . It 's just this headache . I , uh- - I 'll get it for you . Okay . What happened to the other 2 guys that were sick ? They left in body bags . If you 'll excuse me . Yeah , sure . Thanks . What the hell ? We 're about 20 miles from the Chinese military zone . What 's the good news ? The good news- - We 've got a light cruiser and 2 frigates ... passing 4,000 yards off our port side heading in the opposite direction . - The bad news ? - That Chinese Han class sub is still out there . It 's now about 2,500 yards off our port side bearing 1-9-0 . They 're still hunting us . If we navigate into coastal waters ... get down here in this shallow canyon ... even if they engage active sonar , they 'd have a hell of a time finding us . Why would they engage us ? Because we are a threat , Mr. Davies . They don 't know who we are or why we 're here . They could fire on us . U.S. Navy would have to accept their apology ... because we 're not supposed to be here . What happened ? Are you okay ? Your box- - Those snakes- - What did you do with the box , man ? What did you do with it ? They 're-They 're loose . Sailor Rhodes . Mr. Goldin . Hey , look . This guy needs some help . I don 't know . I- - - All right , help me get him to sick bay , now . - Okay . Come on . Kelso , he just got attacked . Okay . Uh , let 's get him on this bunk right here . All right . Okay , you got him ? Bring him up . Bring him up . Yeah . What 's wrong ? The antivenom was right here . Now it 's gone , which means someone took it . Oh , man . This is Kelso in sick bay . Get me the captain right now . - We 've had another snake attack . - Oh , my God . Our corpsman just found Jake in the sick bay looking for aspirin . Now the antivenom 's missing . I got a man dying because of him . - Do you know that he took it ? - Who else would take it ? Where is he ? I don 't know , but I 'm looking for him . All right , we gotta find the antivenom , get it back to sick bay ... before that sailor dies . Oh , my God . - Hey , Jake . Where you going ? - Torpedo Room . I 'm checking for snakes . Yeah , well , you 're headed the wrong way . - Oh , thanks . I must 've got turned around . - If you have it ... - you need to give it to us now . - I don 't know what you 're talking about . The antivenom . A man 's life is at stake . What ? I don 't have the antivenom . You were just in the sick bay . Now it 's missing . So where is it ? I 'm gonna find out . Captain ? - By all means , Mr. Davies . - Hey ! I told you I didn 't have it . If I find out otherwise , I 'm gonna stuff you in a torpedo tube . Taking their side , Andrea ? Is that it ? - Trying to pin all the blame on me , right ? - We 're all in this together . The sooner you realize that , the better . Captain to the conn . Captain to the conn . Keep looking . Wait a minute . Andrea , you can 't blame all this mess on me , okay ? We were just taking orders . It 's not my fault somebody else opened up the container , okay ? The snakes would 've been secure for the whole entire trip . You 're unbelievable , Jake . Now , get down to the torpedo room ... and help the sailors when they bring in the snakes . - Andrea- - - Go , Jake ! Still having electrical problems ? Yes , Captain . We 're having wiring problems with the backup generators . - What 's our depth ? - 2-3-0 feet , sir . - Steady as she goes , Mr. Davies . - Steady as she goes , Captain . - What 's going on out there , Lozano ? - A few contacts , sir . We 're traveling under the shipping lanes of the Chinese coastal military zone . From now on , we 're gonna be hard to find in all this acoustic mess . It should be a good place to lose that Chinese sub . Damn , it 's cold in here . What 's the temperature ? 50 degrees and dropping . Captain , I got a communications link up and running . - Should I send the message ? - Yeah , send it . Good work . Captain . At present speed , our batteries are gonna give us about 12 hours . To recharge , we 'll need to surface . I know that 's not possible . All right . We 'll shut down everything we don 't need . All auxiliary lights , everything . Our back up genny 's giving us problems . Get down to engineering . - Tell them to cut it back 10 knots . - Yes , sir . 10 knots . Sir . I was thinking about what Dr. Swanson said ... about how snakes gravitate toward warmth . What if we heated just the torpedo room ? Might draw the snakes out of their hiding place and contain ' em in one compartment . We could probably fire up one blower without making too much noise . What do you think , COB ? Great idea . I 'm on it . Okay . Okay . Sir , we have a transient . It sounds like someone 's banging on one of the pipes ... - in one of the compartments . - What ? There it is again . Go away . And another one . We gotta stop that right now . Can you isolate where that 's coming from ? It 's possibly the torpedo room . Sierra 15 has turned on active sonar , sir . - He 's got us . - Can you still hear the transient ? - Yes , sir . There 's another one . - Damn it ! Sir , the transient noise has stopped . Sierra 15 has changed course . Bearing 2-0-5 , now at 3,500 yards . - He 's turning away . - No . He 's lining up a snapshot . He 's gonna fire on us ! Torpedo in the water . Bearing 1-9-0 ... at 3,500 yards and closing fast . - Right 25-degree rudder , now ! - 25-degree right rudder ! Sound the collision alarm ! Torpedo 's 2,500 yards and closing , sir . 80 seconds to impact . Torpedo 's 1,200 yards and closing , sir . - 45 seconds to impact . - Is that torpedo armed ? No , not yet , sir . Hold on . Torpedo 's changing course to 1-7-0 . If we emergency-blow to the surface , maybe we can outrun it . We 're in the shipping lanes . That 's the worst place we could resurface . - We got nothing to throw back at it , sir . - He 's not going in for the kill . - Nobody 's that bad of a shot . - How can you be sure , sir ? He knows what we are . He just wants to let us know he could sink us . That torpedo he just fired turned 20 degrees . In 40 seconds , it 's gonna be right there at that mountain . We 're gonna be a hundred yards away . We 'll feel the concussion , but it won 't sink us . Torpedo 's 1,000 yards and closing . Torpedo 's armed in 30 seconds . This is the captain . Prepare for impact . 20 seconds . All right , let 's hope this thing holds together , gentlemen . Amen . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Okay . Oh , God ! This is the captain . Damage report control . Conn , Pump Room . We have some pipes leaking , sir . We 're on it . Conn , sick bay . We 're okay . Your idea may be working , Mr. Davies . I hope so , Captain . Sir , the men are complaining about the cold . It 's also starting to affect some of our gauges . COB , could you turn the blower back on in the control room ? Captain , I 'm on it . Boudreau out . Lozano , where 's that submarine ? Sierra 15 is maintaining course heading of2-0-5 . 3,500 yards off our port side , sir . You think they 're gonna hit us again ? No , I don 't . He made his point . He also left his starboard flank open . He doesn 't know we don 't have torpedoes . Let 's line up a firing solution . Mr. Lozano , engage active sonar . - Yes , sir . Engaging active sonar . - All right . Let 's make him sweat a little bit , make him think we 're gonna fire on him . Maybe we 'll get lucky . He 'll run away . Sierra 15 is changing course to 2-8-5 . Now at 3,600 yards off our port side . It 's working , sir . He 's continuing on a course away from us . If we had fired our torpedoes right there , that guy would 've lost his boat . - That 's a textbook mistake . - Thank you , sir . Don 't thank me . It 's the first time in 20 years I ever faced an armed torpedo . We made it out alive , gentlemen , this time . - Plot a course for Okinawa , Mr. Davies . - Yes , sir . Captain . I 'd feel a lot better if you 'd put this on . No firing unless it 's absolutely necessary . I don 't want somebody getting hit by a ricochet . Understood , sir . - Chief , is everything okay ? - I 'm going down to the torpedo room ... - see if your idea worked . - I 'll go with you . Okay . Jake ! Oh , my God ! Chief . Chief , that 's the antivenom . - That greedy little bastard . - Oh , Jake . No . Wait . Hold on , ma 'am . Hold on . Captain , it 's Boudreau . We found the antivenom . Jake had it the whole time . He 's dead . COB , you 've got to get it to the sick bay . Captain , there 's a floor full of snakes between us and the antivenom . Please advise . COB , you get that antivenom and seal off the torpedo room . Understood , Captain . Boudreau out . - Stay here . - No , no , Chief . Let me do it . I know these snakes better than anyone on board . - Ma 'am , I can 't let you go in there alone . - Trust me . Please . Okay . Good luck . Okay . - Okay . Okay , I got it . - Okay . Let 's go . Lozano , send an update to naval command at Okinawa . - Let ' em know our approximate arrival time is 0800 tomorrow . - Yes , sir . Captain . We 're almost back to normal temperature in the conn . We 'll wait to turn on the fans and blowers to the rest of the boat ... until we 're out of the coastal range just to be safe . Sir , I 'm picking up something 2,000 yards off our starboard side . Military or civilian ? It 's got 5 screws on its plate . It 's definitely military . It 's either a missile frigate or a supply ship . - I can 't pin down the class though . - What 's our depth ? 2-0-0 , Captain . We can buy some time in that noisy coastal traffic , but we 're gonna have to go deeper . Take us down to 2-6-0 feet , 5 degree down bubble . 2-6-0 feet . 5 degree down bubble . Snakes ! We got snakes ! Execute that dive . Mr. Davies , do it ! Whoa ! Captain , I got a live one here . This is the captain . Emergency . Snakes have compromised the control room . We need some help , now ! Chief ? Captain ! He 's been hit ! I said execute that dive ! All right , ma 'am . Back away from ' em . Just back away . I know how to deal with these snakes . Get the antivenom to the control room . Someone might be dying . Take my gun . Safety 's on . I can handle myself . - Go . - Okay . Oh , God . - Back to your post . - Yes , Captain . - Captain , you okay ? - Yeah . Planesman 's been hit . - Okay , I got antivenom . - Where 's the doctor ? We gotta get back down to her . She 's trapped under the engine room . Snakes everywhere . I 'll go down there . X.O. has the conn . - I have the conn . - Get that man to sick bay . Take that antivenom to Kelso . When we come out of the dive , check every possible hiding space . I don 't want any more surprises . If you find a snake , kill it . Oh . How you doing , Doc ? I don 't know . I 've been better . What do you need me to do ? I 'm not sure . I mean , it seems like the snakes like me a lot . I 'm gonna get you out of there ... somehow . - When do we land in Okinawa ? - In the morning . Don 't make any sudden moves . I wasn 't planning on it . Be careful . Now , now . It 's all right . Be still . - Oh ! - Okay , be careful . Oh . Ow ! Oh , God . I got bit on the leg . COB , she 's hit . Get her to the sick bay . All right , men . Give me an update . Captain . Snakes . I hate ' em . I know some of the others weren 't as lucky . I hope we got it in time . We 'll know soon . If I don 't have an allergic reaction and go into shock , we 're halfway there . We 're gonna get you into a military hospital in Okinawa . Captain ? Chief ? I just wanted to thank you for saving my life . - I never meant to- - - Get some rest . We 'll be in port in a few hours . What 's our situation ? We received a message from ComSubPac in Pearl . Apparently , a Major Drake wants us to save as many snakes as possible . We did not get that message . You have the conn , Mr. Davies . Take us into port . Thank you , sir . Take us into port . Oh , and let NATO know about this meeting in Iceland next month . You wanted to see me , Admiral ? Major Drake , I will not tolerate being lied to . - Admiral ? - You didn 't tell me ... your scientists were bringing a cargo of deadly snakes on board that submarine . With all due respect , sir , I did say that our research ... needed to be secured and moved to safety . - That included those snakes , sir . - What about the lives of those men ? Were their lives worth your snakes ? Admiral , our research could save hundreds ... probably thousands of soldiers in the future . So , yes , sir . I think it was worth it . I talked to General Tadeo ... and he would like to give you his opinion on this matter personally . Dismissed . Hey , Doc . They cut you loose early ... or you taking that thing for a test drive ? No , they 're just changing the sheets in there . - It 's really good to see you guys . - Here . Aw . Thank you . They 're beautiful . It was COB 's idea . What 's the prognosis ? How are you feeling ? Well , I 'm doing much better . They say with a little physical therapy , I 'll be up and walking within a month . - Are you guys heading out soon ? - Not me . - I 'm , uh , officially retired . - Congratulations . So , what are you gonna do now , Captain ? I 'm gonna catch the first flight to Pearl Harbor , give my daughter a big hug . - Spend a couple weeks sitting on the beach . - That sounds nice . And you ? Does the military still have you on the project ? I quit . I 'm going back to the university to teach and do some research . It 's where I belong . Well , good luck . Take care of yourself . Thank you . And good luck to you too , Captain . Have a safe trip out there , Chief . Thank you , ma 'am . Take care of yourself . I will . Hey , guys ? Um- - I just want you to know I 'll never forget what you did for me . Anytime . Thank you . It is the end of the road for me , COB . I don 't care if I never see another boat or submarine as long as I live . - What about you ? You got a plan ? - I 'm heading back to the sub . I finally get to take her back into Taiwan . - Good afternoon , gentlemen . - Admiral , what are you doing here ? I wanted to visit the crew and see the submarine off safely . Lieutenant Commander Davies will be at the helm . Congratulations , Davies . Finally got your own boat . I 'm honored . Thank you , sir . - I 'm your chief , sir . - I 'm lucky to have you along , COB . - It 'd be a pleasure . - Well , sir ... I guess this is good-bye . Yep . Next time I see you , you can tell me all about your trip . It 's a deal , sir . I wish you all the best , Jim . I couldn 't have done it without you , Eddie . Chief . Jim , um , I personally wanted to thank you . Because of your bravery and experience , a lot of lives were saved ... and we avoided an international incident . Why , had I known , I would have never allowed those snakes on board . I understand , sir . I wanna recommend you and your entire crew for Commendation Medals . I 'll tell their families . Where you headed ? Got a plane to catch , 1600 hours . Commander ? Fair winds and following seas . Aye , aye , sir . Commander James O 'Neill ? That 's right . - You 're on the transport to Pearl ? - Yes . - You 're cleared to board , sir . - Thank you . All right , come on . Hurry up . Let 's get that thing loaded on the plane .

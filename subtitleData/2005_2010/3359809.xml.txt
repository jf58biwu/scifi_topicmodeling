 Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken . Genesis 3.23 Welcome ... Whatever your origins may be , your arduous journey ends here . The sacrifice of what is dear to you , your consented efforts , makes you ... a natural candidate for citizenship in our society . Eden Log offers you its passport . You are capable of entering in the cycle . Eden Log counts you among its own . The contract is fair . It is thanks to your work below ... that you will build your paradise above . Look after the plant and it will look after you . After this exchange , you will be called to join us ... without any other authority than your own will . Without any other form of reward than the call ... of your new life . The call . Who are you ? I ... don 't know . I ... I don 't know who I am . Stay away ! You 're awakening it . Where are we ? Listen ! I don 't know how you managed to survive until now , but please , go back where you come from ! No ... Tell me how to get out of here . Where do you want to go ? Up there ? There 's nothing left up there . It 's over . Their paradise , their promises . It 's all over , you understand ? I put an end to all of it . Me ! I opened their eyes . Thanks to me , the whole world will know the price to pay ... There is no way out . Please , go . - Did you hear that ? - What ? That . That ! Then it 's already too late . What was it ? The end . The end of the man you once were . Get it over with quickly . Believe me . Get it over with ! You can 't escape from it . I was the architect of this lie . You can 't get out . But don 't worry . Soon , you won 't suffer anymore . Go ! Access to scientific data authorized . Revitalization of memory in process . - Open your level . - No way . - First tell me the meaning of all this . - Calm down . Security is not within your competence . Just open the network to surveillance . The protocol is clear . Access to the zero network is for technicians only . It 's guaranteed . I cannot let your guards through . It is a case of absolute necessity . Your irresponsible attitude constitutes a breach of contract . The plantation is supposed to be self-managing . Surveillance stops at the collector on level zero . - Not below . - You must let us resolve the problem . Resolve the problem ? There 's a war below ! Have you seen the images ? You don 't have the right to go against the workers ' will and keep them from answering the call . The network will not be used for repressive ends ... and certainly not by your guards . You must give us access . The rest isn 't within your competence . Do you hear me ? You may not put forth your conditions to the council . Take it as you wish . But as long as we don 't get information on the condition of the workers at the top , no one will go back up . End of discussion . You are right . This discussion is over . Everything was recorded . If your screws try to get in , I 'm warning you ... I will let everyone know up there what 's going on here ... and what fate Eden Log has in store for immigrant populations . We still have laws ! - We 're in position . Everything 's ready . - Then go ! Find a way to get that working again . Requesting contact with the surface . What 's the situation ? The elevators are still blocked in the upper levels . What about the plantation ? It 's completely blocked . The workers are in the terminal stage . They 're out of control . Get to the upper level , the rest of you . On the double . Images have been broadcast throughout the whole network . That is why the technicians are obstructing access . - It complicates things . - Recover the data from the labs . The rest is left to your discretion . - I see . - The secret . Only the secret matters . New mission . Take control of the laboratories and the technicians . Take control of the technicians ? We 're cleaning up . I want footage of all this . Check your recorders ! The broadcast remains dangerous for the whole system . We 're unable to locate the technician from level-3 . His knowledge of the network is a serious handicap for us . You 'll find a way . The outside isn 't yet ready to accept the secret . You are its guardian . What about us ? What do we do now ? We neutralize the lab and go back to the plantation . We have to locate the architect . We don 't have a choice . Nothing can get out of the network . No signal . No people . Disconnecting memory . Access to scientific data unauthorized . Check this out . I 'm sick of walking around tied to this leash . Would you rather get lost in the network ? Actually , I 'm sick of these corridors too . The faster we get our hands on that asshole , the faster we 'll go back up . Great ! One more dead end ! Let 's hope the other team has had better luck . Access to security data authorized . Map display in process . We 've already searched that whole area . It 's impossible to go any further . The others are taking care of that gallery . We still have this part , and we 'll be done with this level . - He must be in the more humid areas . - Probably . He could be there , there or there . Maybe he 's hiding there . Maybe he changed levels , even . Enough already . There 's no point arguing about it . How is he able to find his way without dropping breadcrumbs ? I don 't get it . It 's because of the darkness . Not enough oxygen gets to the brain . Shut up ! At least , they don 't have any more problems . Tell me how we 're supposed to find a fugitive in a maze he designed himself . Ask the people at the top . Up there ! He diverted the evacuation pipe ! Masks on ! I can 't believe it . Over there ! He 's going up the ducts . It 's no use being so restless . Sorry about the music . It 's the only way I found to calm them down . Well , sort of . I don 't know how much longer all this is going to last . I hope I won 't be here to find out . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? Calm down . And ... Don 't stay too close to the walls either . Do you understand or not ? Up until now , I 've done pretty well . Before you got here , I thought I was the only one in that situation . The problem is , if you can 't talk anymore , it means your mutation has already begun . And I won 't be able to keep you . It 's the only place that 's still a bit protected , here . Maybe you 're hungry . Wait . I 'll see what I 've got left . Hey , that 's a guard 's harness ! What 's a worker doing with that ? Huh ? Why won 't you answer me ? You 'll calm down , eventually . I have all the time in the world , here . You 're going back outside . But first , there 's a little experiment I 'd like to try on you . Untie me ! If you can talk , it means you may still have a chance , you know ? No . I don 't know anything . Where are we ? What is this ? You ? The cages ? What does it mean ? We 're between the plantation and the surface . They harvest the sap down below , and the collector is above . We 're in the maintenance network . - The what ? - The maintenance of the plant . It 's the technicians ' network here . Where they organize everything ... Each floor has a specific purpose ... I 'm only a botanist here . I don 't know everything that 's going on . I need to get out of here . The workers went up that way ... In that state . I guess they 're drawn to the plant . The plant fed them . But without any control and at too high a dose , it made them rot . I thought my only chance was to wait till hunger drives them to kill each other . I hope I 'll still be alive by then . We ended up getting used to each other . But I don 't kid myself . If there wasn 't that piece of plastic between us ... I wouldn 't hold out long enough to get out of reach . It still startles me . After all this time . What I don 't understand ... is how you were able to avoid the effects of the plant . Look . It 's beautiful , isn 't it ? Its sap has infinite energetic properties . And believe me , it 's only the beginning . Let me test you . Don 't worry , you 've got nothing to fear , except knowing a bit more about yourself . If you 're healthy , the plant will try to contaminate you . It will trigger the alarm ... and the transfusion will stop . You can 't hold it against it . It 's as if it was trying to make contact . Access to the greenhouse authorized . Releasing mixture . I 'll find out what it wants from us eventually . The process is reversing . Impossible ! It can 't be ! The plant has always been sterile . Where do you come from ? Wait . They found something , I think . Meet me at the glass . Watch the entrance . They finally found the way . They 're after me . Don 't move . They 're everywhere ! Watch out ! It 's a simple security measure . Until you get your wits back . Opening hatches . I 'm sorry . I can 't take the chance to take you with me . No ! Get away ! It 's not me . It 's not me . Come . You 're not like them . I don 't get it . The plant . You . The guards coming down . The workers going up . An elevator ! Damaged data . Insufficient data . Nothing works here . Access to scientific data authorized . Revitalization of memory in process . I am the last technician before the exit level . I don 't have much time left . We were gullible . We believed in the perfect cycle . Energy generated for the outside , distributed everywhere and to everyone . Men digging underground , impervious to the pain of their efforts , revived at the surface by the fruit of their work , will thus earn their place in this new society . The structure is different here . It 'll never hold ! We knew what we wanted from the plant . We believed in its generosity . But its conditioning comes at a price . It defends itself against us . What 's happening to me now happened to the workers down below . But I won 't end up like them . I 've got no choice but to graft myself to it . Only the extraction from the plant can block the mutations . But nothing can reverse the process . Now I know what society does with the sick . They never come back down . Eden Log must have decided it was the price to pay . We , the technicians of the network , will not keep this lie going . They left everything open . Eden Log . Forerunner in new energies . I remember , in the beginning , they had said that with just one tree , and the exploitation of its roots , there would be enough energy for a whole city . And I believed it . There ! It 's the sap collector . The plant is above it . The cubes . They 're connected to the machines . Don 't go back ! Never ! Don 't you get it ? The people in the cubes ... It wasn 't to cure them ! They don 't want the energy from the plant ... but the energy from people ! What was that ? Did you hear ? I 'm sorry . No . Not me . It can 't be . Not after all this time . I 'm doomed . It 's you . You 're the one who contaminated me . It 's you ! You contaminated me ! I know ... I know this place . I know . I know this place . Go up to security . Make contact with the surface . Access to scientific data authorized . Loading memory from level-2 . I 've arrived at the plantation . Requesting contact . Urgent . I don 't copy . I 'll send you the footage . I 'm the network botanist . The plant is becoming more and more toxic as it is growing . It seems that the more we take its sap , the more the plant defends itself . The warnings sent to Eden Log have remained unanswered . The architect from level-3 , the most capable of finding his way through the network , has decided to go down to report what is happening above , in the plantation . Here 's the footage I 've been able to retrieve . It 's my turn . It 's calling me . I know what 's in store for me . End of recording . Loading level-4 memory . Everything was recorded ! If your screws try to get in , I 'm warning you ... I will let everyone know up there what 's going on here ... and what fate Eden Log has in store for immigrant populations . We still have laws ! - We 're in position . Everything 's ready . - Then go ! Find a way to get that working again . Requesting contact with the surface . - What 's the situation ? - What about the plantation ? It 's completely blocked . The workers are in the terminal stage . They 're out of control . We 're unable to locate the technician from level-3 . His knowledge of the network is a serious handicap for us . Recover the data from the labs . The rest is left to your discretion . I see . The secret . Only the secret matters . Loading security data . Decryption of security data . 20 % . New mission . Take control of the laboratories and the technicians . Of the technicians ? We 're cleaning up . I want footage of all this . - The broadcast remains dangerous ... - Decryption of security data . 40 % . Decryption of security data . 70 % . Decryption of security data . 90 % . Completed . Reading security data . Are you going to be okay ? I 'm going to get help . Can you hold on ? Requesting contact with the surface . The plantation is devastated . We 're stuck below . Do you copy ? Nothing works . Do you copy ? Access to security archives authorized . Welcome , Tolbiac . Revitalization of memory in process . The situation is critical . We have intercepted the footage from the plantation . Attention to all guards . Following orders from the council , get ready to go down and silence the plantation . End of the revolt at the plantation . Task completed . Elimination of the architect . Task completed . Access to the observation scientific network . Task completed . Recall your forces . It 's Tolbiac . Mission completed . The council is satisfied with the way you have carried this mission . The revolt of the plantation workers and the network resistance have just been a hitch which we look forward to rectifying . You are the most apt to secure the area , and what is already the model for a new exploitation . Let 's reinvest the plantation . Access to the greenhouse authorized . You must regain control . We 're ready to go down , sir . Open up . You have helped us preserve the most important thing . Maintaining the secret . Just long enough for us to bring our citizens to acknowledge that their daily life requires a new social order . To bring them to understand we must have the courage to impose a solution on these faraway populations , from lands of frustration . All these men and women who don 't have a choice but to hope for what we 've never been able to offer them . We need men like you . Conscious of abnegation , of the necessary sacrifice this new world requires . The time will come when the secret will no longer be needed . Our citizens will eventually accept what our needs require of these populations . After a period of deprivation and suffering , we 'll finally have a way to integrate all these populations into our civilizations . At last , the return to Eden . For all that .

 Here comes another one ! Dan JD . Falcon ! Why are you here ? Underground . So this is the town that stole your left arm and left leg . It was him who made Iceman 's body the way it is . I have to find out . I wasn 't chosen . I was thrown away like trash . Why was I drawn back here where it all began ? Maybe it 's because I ought to live in shame . Is that so ? Why the hell did you come here ? Why else ? A certain person paid for your death . not me . The legend is what makes you a liability . Time to die and take the legend with you ! Die ... Destroy ! It 's Destroy ! Iceman ! Dan ! Get to the surface ! Iceman Hotty ... Locked on . Destroy ! Iceman ! Mr. Dan ! Iceman ... You 're in danger ! Let me go ! Iceman is ... he will . hurry ! 100 ) } boku ga boku no mama irareru basho sagasou 100 ) } tsuki ni terasare hashiridasu yo 100 ) } furui shakai nado shikato shite 100 ) } bokura ga terashi ruuru ni nare { ? } 100 ) } hora ! buchikowase kono te de 100 ) } kimi ga kimi no mama motomeru basho wa doko 100 ) } dare no iinari ni mou naru na yo 100 ) } yume wa shinjiru furikazase 100 ) } boku ga boku no mama iru tame ni wa itsumo 100 ) } shinjita omae wa tsuranukunda 100 ) } sou da saigo wa kisu shitai 100 ) } I 'm gonna look for a place where I can stay the way I am .

Now I 'll take your head from your shoulders so you can never come before me again . I get it . I won 't interfere . You 're a lucky man . Become rust on my katana . I know . Luck is on my side today . I get a second shot at you . brokedown legend ! I 'll carve your Bigfoot to match you ! You fool . You think a ball like that can defeat me ? What ? ! That ball ! Basquash ! Now I really can say I 've seen the legend inside of you . You 're coming with us . Throw her in ! That is not something men should do . Who are you ? ! A masked man who protects lovely girls from dark and sinister schemes ! The people call me ... Mr. Perfect ! Shit ! That was a close call . Are you hurt ? Mr. James . young lady ? Mr. Perfect ! Mr. Perfect A.K.A. James . My legend is as fleeting as my bubbles ... Coco ! now it 's my turn ! okay ? Yeah whatever . Just watch ! You suck so bad ! This is how I read the wind . The wind ? Why ? Because the wind can both help and hinder the ball . Want to try ? Yeah ! It takes practice . Time passes so quickly as I get older . I guess it makes sense for me to grow young again . The blockheads who built this didn 't know what they were doing . So you really don 't have any good memories of Mooneyes ? I 'm not one to speak . I know . It 's written on your bust . That was a joke . Gramps ! I 'll be damned . Don 't tell me one of the giants of legend came down here ! He was digging up really tasty-smelling rocks underground . So you came from the moon to mine ultimite . Hey . How did you know would emerge aboveground there ? Oh . Someone gave us a heads-up . Professor Ayukawa . Any progress ? General Manager Harris ! At your request we can certainly compile a report — Spare me the details . Just give me the truth . present status is seventy percent . Seventy ? That 's lagging behind schedule . There was a birth of unexpected emotion on the psych profile that took some time to deal with . but there is some partial data loss ... That 's not a serious problem . Prioritize acceleration of the process . Even we only have so much time to work with . James ! Sky ... Clouds ... What 's that ? That 's a bird ! Delicious when roasted ! It doesn 't collide with the ceiling ? huh ? Yes . All this time the world was so full of light . I 've never seen so many colors at once . Such beauty ... I feel like I finally understand what " living " means . Now that 's just exaggerating . Mooneyes is even prettier ! More so than the land ? It 's on a whole different level from here . It sparkles ! Go join them if you want to . It makes me think instant friendship built just on love of Basquash is no small talent . Isn 't Navi your type ? Not really . He 's too big . Everything has its limit . that guy 's monstrous . That won 't work ... it 's just doesn 't fit ... and yes ! That has to go like this ! And then ... Done ! Mr. Navi ? Legend ? Yes . and the path it traced was the shape of the heavens ' creation . The legend says giants made all the stars in the heavens . It sounded so outrageous that I only partially believed it . looking at you makes me wonder if the legend might be true . I don 't know . The elders may have said something like that long ago ... Then you should find out with your own eyes . Huh ? I mean ... Return to the moon once more and discover the truth behind the legend . Isn 't it simple ? we make these . What 's that ? Those are shoe designs . But aren 't these ... ? Exactly . I got his size from Navi 's feet . These are shoes for a giant . I 'll give him the best possible shoes ! I 'll require he wears them . Are you going back to Lunatic ? have you ? will you ? All technology should be shared . Professor . There are exceptions to everything . The power of ultinium is too much for human hands . don 't you agree ? It 's because of that I made a mistake I can never take back . you smarten up real quick . Sounds more like an excuse for getting old to me . I 'm grateful to you for helping my grandchildren . Legends seek each other out . I doubt the result would be any different . I haven 't heard from you at all since you went to Mooneyes ... are you well ? princess . Baaya . Let 's take the lack of contact as a sign that she is doing just fine . And don 't forget that Princess Flora has Jiiya with her . That 's true . It says they 'll air some shocking announcement about Eclipse pretty soon . Nothing to do with us . Man ... Wish I was out of here ... I wonder if Dan 's " getting along " with Miss Rouge right now . How come this world 's so unfair ? and then there are guys like us stuck in the slammer getting mean and scrawny . And the food stinks . when we get out you should write a diet book . It 'd be a bestseller for sure . No way . No one would copy a prison diet voluntarily . Guess not ... huh ? It went over there ! You stink ! What kind of pass was that ? That 's right . Don 't worry about it . let them do as they wish . You go ahead and start the demolition . Compensation ? Don 't be ridiculous . There 's no need to pass out money to these people . Make speeding up the schedule your first priority . Yan Harris . General Manager of Lunatic Earthdash . It 's because of his doing that we can barely recognize the city . we 're done for . Shit . This is not setting a good example for the Family . Señor Rosso . Commissioner . Understood . But is that really what you want ? This is a matter of pride . Okay . Amazing how you guys never get sick of this . It 's about time I settled this ! I wonder if you can . Navi ! sorry — Jerk . How long were you planning on staring ? So peaceful ... Navi ? Sela was in the shower . So you got a nosebleed . That 's not why . That 's too bad . though . I wouldn 't have let him off so easily if he did ! Do you dislike Mr. Navi ? you really go straight to the heart of things . It 's not a matter of liking or disliking . Just think about it logically . He 's roughly the same size as a Bigfoot ! there 's just no way ! But I bet his genes are extra-tough to match . And I 'm saying that size is not the only criteria ! Geez . Don 't bunch me together with Souichi . Sela has surprisingly discriminating standards . Excuse me . Could you get everyone together ? Haruka ? It 's time to go . { huh ? sound } But I thought we were stopping here for the day . The situation has changed . We need to get to Turbine City ASAP . The failure of the moon launch was a truly unfortunate accident . We of the OCB want to give all of you another chance to get to the moon . But there 's no such thing as a free lunch . Stingy bastard . the OCB Comissioner has decided to hold a special exhibition match . You could think of it as last-ditch fundraising to once again dispatch Team Basquash to Mooneyes . That came in my mail just a few minutes ago . What does it mean ? I guess it means our moon passports are still valid . The match venue he specified was Turbine City . and win ... They 'll send us to the moon one more time . I like it . It 's just what we need ! let 's make sure we get to Mooneyes ! I 'm going to the moon . I can settle things with you after that . Iceman . Sela ... The ultimate stage awaits you . Don 't disappoint us . right ? Is that who gave you your bubbles ? Pretty much . You could say I inherited them .

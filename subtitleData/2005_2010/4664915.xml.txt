 Shortly after a month had passed since entering school much like Sisyphus forced to eternally roll a boulder uphill I 'd had my fill of this mandatory morning hiking course . as if being dealt the final blow my normal life came to a grinding halt when the incident happened . N-No . Began would be more accurate . I just have to make it myself ! A club ! Assist me . I just came up with a name ! SOS Brigade ! Thanks to Haruhi Suzumiya ... my journey through never-ending hell had begun . Good morning ! Good morning . I forgot that I had to do today 's class duties . I have to hurry to the staff office and ask for the diary . Sorry ! I 'm going on ahead ! It 's hard to believe a girl like her is in the same class when ... Kyon . What else do you think we need ? For what ? don 't you think ? I 'm begging you . Establish the context before you start talking . What the SOS Brigade needs ! I at least want a mysterious transfer student . I 'd like you to define mysterious first . It hasn 't even been two months since the new term began . right ? right ? Maybe the student 's dad was suddenly transferred . No ! That 's abnormal . What would you consider normal ? I 'd like to know that . I wonder if a mysterious transfer student will show up . you don 't give a damn what I think ... Do you ... It would appear that a rumor had spread that Haruhi and I were plotting something . 45 ) } The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya II Say . What are you and Suzumiya up to ? Don 't tell me you 're going out . Absolutely not . I 'm the one who would like to know exactly what the hell we 're doing . Don 't overdo it . We 're not in middle school anymore . If you render the grounds unusable they 'll at least suspend you . I have to at least prevent Yuki Nagato and Mikuru Asahina-san from coming to any harm . 416 ) \ fs24 \ 1cHFFFFFF } CHIEF After the SOS Brigade was founded ... 386 ) \ fs22 \ 1cHFFFFFF } CHIEF ... the bleakness of the former literary clubroom was replaced by a growing number of items . I mean . Is she planning on living here ? too . We 're living in the information age and yet we don 't have a single computer ... I can 't forgive them ! Can 't forgive who ? Then . Let 's go scrounge one up . now . Do you actually have any leads ? Are you planning on raiding an electronics store ? Of course not . 273 ) } Computer Research Society There 's one much closer . Hello ! We 're here to take one set of computer and peripherals ! Who 's the leader ? Do you need something ? There 's only one reason I would come in person to the Computer Research Society . I only need one so give me a computer . What are you talking about ? One can 't hurt . You 've got so many ! Now look here . Wait . Who are you people ? Haruhi Suzumiya . These two are subordinates # 1 and # 2 . There you have it . Stop your grumbling and hand one over . For what reason ! ? There 's no way I would ever do that ! I see . I have my own ideas about that . What 's this ! ? Wh-What are you trying to do ! ? Okay ! One more shot ! What are you doing ! ? Tsk . Tsk . Tsk . I 've got pictures of your sexual harassment now . If you don 't want me to spread these pictures around school pay up and hand over a computer . That 's ridiculous ! You forced me to do it ! I 'm innocent ! And how many people do you think will believe your words ? A-All the members here are witnesses ! That 's right ! It wasn 't the prez 's fault ! I 'll say that the whole club was planning on * * * * - * * * * * * her ! That 's taking it too far ... What will it be ? Are you going to hand it over ? Or not ? Su-Suzumiya-san ... That 's ... Take whichever one you want ... Prez ! Hang in there ! Get a hold of yourself ! { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } It wasn 't your fault ! Is this supposed to be a comedy ? { \ an8 \ 3cH000000 } But ! Which one 's the newest ? Why do I have to tell you that ! ? Damn it . That one . I looked over all the newest models at the computer shop yesterday . This wasn 't one of them . W-Wait ! Give me this one ! H-Hold on ! We just bought that last month ! you thief . It 's as you say . We 're thieves . Kyon . Carry this . just like that after blackmailing herself a spanking new computer ... discovering that the literary clubroom wasn 't equipped for Internet use summoned the Computer Society 's president and members and had them run a LAN cable between our rooms . She even had him set it up so we could connect through the school 's domain . This is what you call an extortionist . Let 's go back for now . Asahina-san . You shouldn 't get involved with such a weird group . Who knows what else she 'll do to you . No . It 's okay . aren 't you ? This was probably an inevitability on this time plane . And I 'm concerned about why Nagato-san is here . What about it ? No . It 's nothing . I may be inexperienced but I hope to get along with everyone . if you 'd like please call me Mikuru-chan .

Who 's going to make it ? That site or whatever . You . don 't you ? Make it . I have to find more members . Have it finished in a day or two . We can 't participate in any activities until a site 's up . huh ... I actually enjoyed making it . The Computer Society had installed most of the necessary programs so it was pretty simple .

I still have no idea what the SOS Brigade does . Nagato . Do you have anything you want to put on the site ? Nothing . but ... right ? Crap . Time for class . Here . I 'll lend you this . 209 ) } Dan Simmons I still have my misgivings so why is it that I continue commuting to the clubroom ? indeed ... Is this the power of habit ? What a riot . 'Sup ! And yeah . Are these two really that bored ? Though I guess I 'm not one to talk . Where 's Suzumiya-san ? Beats me . She was already gone during sixth period . Perhaps she 's off extorting more equipment . Will I be forced to do something like yesterday again ... Do not worry . I 'll do everything I can to prevent it . Really ? Thank you ! I 'm counting on you then ! You can count on me . Ya-hoo ! Yahoo ? First up is this ! A proclamation of the SOS Brigade creed ... And this . Ta-ta-ta-da ! We 're going to distribute flyers wearing these . Where at ? The front gate . There should be plenty of students heading home right now . So ? What are we wearing ? I wasn 't talking about you . Mikuru-chan 's the one who 's wearing this . Yes ? Bunny girl ! Um ... Um ... What do you ... Come on ! Get changed ! Get changed ! I don 't want to ! Shut up ! Take it off ! Take it off ! No ! Suzumiya ! What are you doing ! ? No ! Don 't look ! Come on ! Do as I say ! There ! Take it all off ! No ! At least let me undress myself ... N-No ! Come on in ! She 's like some evil feudal lord . What do you think ? right ? More like suck in attention ... What about Nagato ? I could only buy two of them . I got the full set so it was expensive . Where do they sell this stuff ? I ordered it online . I see . I 'm off then ! Mikuru-chan ! No ! Let 's go ! Sorry . I can 't get enough of that outfit . My passion is running wild . Wha â€” Good grief ... I can still feel their body heat . It 's all warm . A proclamation of the SOS Brigade creed ... Our SOS Brigade is looking for mysteries of the world . People who have experienced something mysterious in the past ... People who have run into something mysterious recently ... People who plan on a mysterious experience in the near future ... come see us ! We will solve your problem on the spot ! a normal mystery will not do . It has to be a mystery that wows us ! Make note of that ! I think I 'm starting to understand the purpose of this brigade . I 'm pissed ! What 's with those stupid teachers ? They 're such a pain ! A pain ! Was there some kind of a problem ? Way beyond that ! We hadn 't even distributed half the flyers and the teachers told us to stop ! Who do they think they are ! ? If two bunny girls start handing out flyers at the front gate people who aren 't teachers will come running . Mikuru-chan started sobbing ... I was dragged to the student guidance office ... Even that handball moron Okabe was brought in ! They were probably all on the verge of tears . Man ... That 's enough for today ! Dismissed ! How long are you going to keep crying ! ? Come on ! Get changed ! Kyon-kun . If I become ruined for marriage will you take me ? What should I say ? Asahina-san . you look like a student who just failed to get into college . Or a salaryman after buying a house beyond his budget . Wait . too ? the name Haruhi Suzumiya had transcended mere notoriety and became common knowledge for all students . Kyon . You 've finally become one of Suzumiya 's merry friends . Shut up . What 's even worse is that Asahina-san 's name and mine had become associated with hers . I was really surprised yesterday . there were bunny girls standing at the front gate . Huh ... right ? The whole school has their attention on you guys now . What is this SOS Brigade ? Ask Suzumiya . I have no idea . Don 't want to know either . It looks like you people are having fun . But I think that was going a bit too far . Asahina-san was absent from school that day . Why don 't we ever get e-mails ? After all that publicity ! There aren 't any people curious enough to want to get involved after witnessing your publicity . I 'll admit that you 've made us famous though . Huh ? Is Mikuru-chan absent today ? She might not ever come back . I hope she doesn 't become traumatized by the ordeal . I even brought a new outfit for her . Wear it yourself . too . But it 's no fun when Mikuru-chan isn 't here ! You could have Nagato wear it . She 'd probably put it on without any complaints . And I get the feeling I wouldn 't mind seeing that . The SOS Brigade was just formed and we 're already sitting around doing nothing . I wonder if they 're all holding back . They want to keep the mystery to themselves ? Haruhi . If you ask anybody here ... there aren 't any . There 's no way this little public high school would have mysteries bouncing around . right ? right ? Just that you have nowhere to vent the frustrations of youth and that restlessness is leading you down a different path . Snap out of it already . How about you go find some handsome guy and walk home from school together or go see a movie on Sundays ? And join some sports club and knock yourself out . They 'd make you a regular member in a flash . I 'm going home ! Well ... too . Did you read it ? Read what ? The book . not yet ... Should I return it ? Not necessary . But man ... huh ... Read it today . As soon as you get home . I understand . 427 ) } 7 PM Waiting in the park in front of Kouyou Station 433 ) } 7 PM Waiting in the park in front of Kouyou Station 430 ) } 7 PM Waiting in the park in front of Kouyou Station 426 ) } 7 PM Waiting in the park in front of Kouyou Station 298 ) } the park in front of Kouyou Station Kyon-kun ? Station . Don 't talk while eating . Was today okay ? Were you possibly waiting here yesterday as well ? Why here ? This way . Where 's your family ? They aren 't here . Well ... I can see that ... Are they out ? I am the only one who is ever here . You 're living alone ? Yes . So what did you want ? Drink . Is it good ? I 'm gonna explode . Uh ... Could you tell me why you brought me here ? What is it that you couldn 't tell me at school ? About Haruhi Suzumiya . And myself . That is what I need to talk about . What about Suzumiya and you ? It is difficult to convey in words . Discrepancies may arise during the transmission of data . Regardless listen . Haruhi Suzumiya and I are not ordinary humans . I kind of knew that already . That isn 't what I mean . I am not referring to the absence of universally accepted personality traits ... I mean what I said . She and I are different from the vast majority of humans like yourself . An organic life contact-purpose humanoid interface created by the Data Integration Thought Entity which supervises this galaxy . That would be me . Say what ? In more common terminology I would be classified as an alien . Alien ?

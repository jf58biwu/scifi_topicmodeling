 ( LASER GUNS FIRING ) ( PEOPLE SHOUTING ) No ! Help ! Mistress , I bring you another . MISTRESS : I need more , many more children ! It shall be done , Mistress . At breakfast time , I 'm so hungry , I could murder a bowl of cornflakes . Does that make me a cereal killer ? - You 're not laughing ! - It wasn 't very funny . I 've been studying jokes , their structure and history . - You swap words around , so that was a joke . - I guess . What makes a joke funny ? Timing is important . How , exactly ? - I don 't know , it 's complicated . - Is the context important ? Why does everything with you lead to 500 questions ? - I want to get a bag . - You 've got lots of bags . - You can never have too many bags . - Another thing I don 't understand . Don 't worry , you 're a guy . You 're not meant to . What do you reckon ? Do you think you 're man enough to have a go ? I have to go shopping . That 's kind of answered my question . - Come on , Luke . - Vouchers , in case you change your mind . - LUKE : Thank you ! - Thanks . Come on . Posters are up . I 'm doing a radio piece at 3 : 00 , and I 've given the tickets to a street team to shift . You wait , Mr Kudlak . The last few weeks ' takings will be nothing compared to what we 've got coming . Oh , guess what ? We got a birthday party booked in for tomorrow ! ( GROWLS ) I grow tired of your talk , Mr Grantham . Just bring me children ! ( GROWLING ) - This is Lance . - Oh , thank you , Mrs Metcalf . I can 't imagine what the last three days have been like . - Are you coping ? - I keep thinking my head 's going to break . That 's what it feels like . I 'm on edge every minute , thinking that he 'll walk up the path or the police will come and tell me ... Children do turn up safe . There 's every chance . Someone may have seen something important . My story might make them realise that and come forward . - I hope so . - Has anything like this happened before ? - Lance has never run away after an argument ? - We never argue . Me and Lance , we 've only got each other now . We know life 's too short for rowing . I see . I 'm sorry . Perhaps you could tell me what happened on Saturday . Nothing happened . Only Lance never came back . He was going out to meet his friend Brandon . They were going down the arcade . He lives for his video games . Only Brandon never saw him on Saturday . Lance never showed up . He just vanished into thin air . Help me get my boy back , Miss Smith . Please . Please . ( MARIA LAUGHING ) - Do you mind ? - Sorry , Sarah Jane . Clyde was just bugging around with Maria 's bag . - I 'm sorry ? - I was " mucking " around . Or " messing " . You know , messing around ? You 've got to listen to the words . They 're important in slang . - Sorry , we 'll get out of your way . - No , wait . I 've been to see the mother of your friend Lance . What do you know about him ? Friend ? Don 't get me wrong , I hope he 's okay , but the Corporal 's only been at our school a couple of months , and he 's not made friends . - The Corporal ? - Lance , lance corporal . Did you know his father was in the army , was killed in Iraq ? Nicknames aren 't always funny . I hope he didn 't run away because he was bullied . Don 't get all over me . Luke made up the nickname . People laughed . I thought that was good . It wasn 't Luke 's fault . No one knew about Lance 's dad . He didn 't tell anyone . He didn 't have much to do with us . Most times , he was too busy with his Nintendo . But I made a joke out of his name . I hurt him . Maybe Lance wanted friends . Instead , I probably made him run away . - Oh , no , Luke ... - It 's all my fault ! - I 'd better go and talk to him . - No , let me . I did drop him in it . - Is he finding it really hard to fit in ? - No harder than the rest of us . Clyde will talk to him . He 'll be all right . - How 's Lance 's mum ? - Going out of her mind with worry . You don 't think there 's anything weird , do you ? You 're not doing this story because you think there 's aliens involved ? I don 't see aliens behind every bush , Maria . I 'm not a conspiracy theorist . No , I know . I just wondered , that 's all . Now this friend of Lance 's , Brandon , do you know him ? ( VIDEO GAME BEEPING ) - Hi , Brandon . - What do you want ? - This is my friend Sarah Jane . - I want to ask you some questions about Lance . That 's him . - SARAH JANE : Halo ? - Yeah , that 's Lance . He 's the nuts . - Is that good ? - Very . I was meant to meet him in the park and go to the arcade . - And did you ? - He never showed . - I thought the storm put him off . - There wasn 't a storm . - Are you calling me a liar ? - No , but Saturday was sunny . - I remember . I was in the garden until dark . - It was weird . It only lasted a minute . These clouds came up the hill and then it just poured on me . And then the clouds just vanished and it was blue skies again . It was weird . - Frightening ? - Yeah . For a while , I thought you 'd gone AWOL with Lance . - Been looking all over for you . - Why ? That 's what friends do when one of them is hurting . They try and help . - Friends shouldn 't grass each other up . I 'm sorry . - How did you grass me up ? We 'll get back to slang another day . Ding-ding ! New class . How the Corporal has nothing to do with Luke . - Don 't call him that . - He 's not here . It doesn 't matter . I was trying to be funny , not cruel . Not everyone 's cut out to be me . See what I mean ? ( GROWLING ) - MISTRESS : Kudlak ! - I am here , Mistress . MISTRESS : You must bring me children . Fresh , strong children . I will , Mistress . You have my vow . This hunger for blood , it never ends . You shall have what you need . Soon you shall have all the children you need . Have all these kids really gone missing in a year ? We need to cross-reference these disappearances with reports of freak weather conditions . MR SMITH : I will assimilate with meteorological databases . What does this storm have to do with Lance going missing ? That 's what we 're going to find out . I don 't think Brandon is the sort of boy to be scared by any normal storm . Maybe there is something weird about Lance 's disappearance after all . - I have a data match for 24 children . - Twenty-four ? Their disappearances all coincide with instances of unexpected torrential rain . - MARIA : All towns and cities . - Why would it rain like that ? - Insufficient data . - Mr Smith , maybe we can get you some more . - So , what are we doing exactly ? - Pass me that spanner . - What do you know about energy ? - It can 't be created or destroyed . Very good . Now , a storm is created by , and in turn creates , energy . The residue hangs around for a while and that could tell us a lot . Put those gloves on and pass me those two cylinders one at a time . No ! I said put the gloves on first ! Those are made from Cibrianite Flux . Touch them without protection and you complete an electro-neurological circuit . - Put you out cold for an hour . - Oh . You know , we should get my dad over . He 's good at DIY . We could say it 's my science project . He 's got lots of tools . Bet he hasn 't got one of these . Stand back . Sometimes it feels like I 'll never fit into this world . When I made a joke about Lance 's name , it felt like a breakthrough because people laughed . Instead , it was another social miscalculation . - Gaffe , Luke . It was a gaffe . - Last week , a " gaffe " was where a dude lives . It 's different . Just stick to the text . - You see , things are so complex . - Complex ? Be grateful your old man didn 't run off with your aunt . Listen to me , I 'm an expert in complex . - You can explain things to me ? - Just ask Encyclopaedia Clydannica . - Go on , anything you want . - What 's the purpose of games ? Why play games ? This . This looks like war , but it 's a game . Why ? - It 's just a laugh . - But they pretend to kill people . Okay , you want to find out ? Let 's do it . Mistress is worried . It has been a month , yet our returns are minimal . - I can 't help it if the kids are low-grade . - We must find better . We must work harder . Your mistress should come down . She could hand out some flyers . - Do not mock my mistress ! - It was a joke , okay ? - We serve at her pleasure . - Yeah , sure , sure . Neither of us is irreplaceable . Not I and certainly not you . ( GROWLS ) Ta-da ! This is where Brandon got caught in the rain . - Come on , let 's get her going . - Okay . Right . Now turn the dial on the left . 6.02 for the electromagnetic pulse trace . Just got to calibrate the Kohonen net . Right switch to 1 5 and the middle to 2.6 . Now then ... Right , fire it up ! ( DEVICE HONKING ) MARIA : Wow ! SARAH JANE : Again . Nothing . Once more ! There should be some sort of reaction . - MARIA : What 's happening ? - It works ! My machine works ! MR SMITH : Particles identified as entanglement shells . Do you want to tell us what an entanglement shell is exactly ? Used by climate engineers to terraform hostile planet environments . They stimulate rainfall . Ealing doesn 't need terraforming . - If I might continue ? - Please ! Entanglement shells can also be a by-product of trans-dimensional energy dispersal . - By what ? - Teleportation . Aliens ! I knew it ! - Lance was kidnapped by aliens ? - They 've been kidnapping people for decades . The question is , why Lance ? And from where ? Mr Smith , can you pinpoint the centre of the storm on Saturday ? Weather geo-stationary satellites record every hour and are unlikely to have registered such a brief anomaly . I will access a military satellite . You shoot out people 's sensors . If you get hit , your gun goes down and you lose a life . You get 1 00 lives . The person with the most lives left wins . - Last man standing . - I don 't get the point . Just wait until the adrenaline starts pumping . MAN ON PA : Attention ! Warriors of the future , take your places . Prepare to do battle ! Show no mercy ! Take no prisoners ! This is a fight for survival ! Only one can be the ultimate warrior ! Battle commences in 1 0 seconds . - Have you brought me good stock ? - I wouldn 't get your hopes up just yet . MAN ON PA : Four , three , two , one ! - Take no prisoners ! - Commence combat ! ( ALL SHOUTING ) This is animated data from a NATO satellite covering Western Europe taken on Saturday at 1 604 hours . Run it again and slow it down . People never really vanish without a trace . You 've just got to know where to look . Stop ! Show me what 's right there , at the heart of it . MARIA : I know that place ! We were there earlier , me and Luke ! " Combat 3000 . " CLYDE : Move ! Luke ! Now ! LUKE : Nice . CLYDE : Cover me ! Cover me ! Look out ! Go , Luke ! I 'll cover you ! Well , you 're not such a mummy 's boy after all , are you ? Someone shows promise ? There 's a couple of kids . One of them is really something . Really going for it . It 's like he 's got something to prove . I smell warrior blood . Mistress will be pleased . ( GROWLS ) I wouldn 't bet your spaceship on it just yet . Let 's see if he makes it through Level 2 . Come on , Clyde . Yeah . Hey , I won ! And look , you came second ! - Beginner 's luck . We should go again . - I thought you said it was for kids . It is , but it 's all part of your education . I 'm not enjoying it . - That 's an impressive score . - Clyde says it was beginner 's luck , but I 've got better reflexes and hand-to-eye coordination . You do ? Wow ! Well , you make one hell of a future warrior . I 'd be good at killing people if the eventuality arose ? You don 't get invited to many parties , do you ? I was showing him what to do . He 's Luke , which makes me Obi-Wan Kenobi . - How 's it going ? - Me and Mr Kudlak , he 's the proprietor , we run a special competition for the more skilled competitors . It 's Level 2 . Are you up for it ? - Yeah ! - Good . Welcome to the unique gaming experience that is Combat 3000 . Zap those Drones ! Hi . I 'd like to book a party . I 've heard a lot about this place . Apparently , it 's the nuts . Let 's agree to never say that ever again . - I wouldn 't if I were you . - I 'm sorry ? For her , is it ? I 'd take her to see a film . You don 't want to come here , it 's mental . Used to be peaceful till Mr Grantham took over . - Mr Grantham ? - Mm . Him and his partner , Mr Kudlak . - Not that anybody ever sees him . - Could I speak to him ? Do you know , it always seems to be raining since they moved in . My sister 's offered me part-time in the tanning salon and I 'm thinking , " Well , you only live once . " Why don 't we just go through ? I can see you 're busy . Hey ! Welcome to the unique gaming experience ... CLYDE : See him ? He does kickboxing . She does athletics and he 's in the football A team . This is wicked ! It 's like Premier League for laser tag . Guys ! Well done for getting through to Level 2 . New arena , new objective . You 'll be split into four disbursement groups . You 'll access the arena from here , here and here . When the first siren sounds , you break for cover . When the second siren sounds , the mission begins . - Mission ? - The first soldier to make it through the door , down the corridor and into this chamber , will win their place in the world championships . They have a laser tag world championships ? That 's why I said it . Now , this time , you don 't get 1 00 lives . - You get ten . - Ten ? - Piece of cake . - Do you think so ? A word of advice , son , the ultimate warrior of the future is always on guard for surprise attacks . Seems like a good place to start . ( SONIC LIPSTICK BEEPING ) ( PLAYERS SHOUTING ) The others are playing by the old rules . If we work as a team , we 'll have the advantage . Like I said , piece of cake . ( ALARM BLARING ) ( GROWLS ) Grantham ! Grantham ! - What are we looking for ? - You 'll know . - See what bubbles to the top . - Does that mean you don 't know ? - Not as such . - Perhaps I can help . Mr Grantham , I presume . Not Mr Kudlak . I hear he likes to stay in the shadows . Who are you and what are you doing in my office ? Sarah Jane Smith , journalist . - Who 's she ? - My work experience girl . It was either this or putting up scaffolding . I 'm doing a story on laser games and their effect on aggression levels . No comment . Now get out ! Any comment on Lance Metcalf ? The boy that disappeared three days ago ? Twenty-four children have disappeared . Manchester , Brighton , Leeds , Inverness . All cities where there 's a Combat 3000 . Every time , in the middle of a freak storm . Still no comment , Mr Grantham ? Do you know why people come to Combat 3000 ? They come for the guns . A soldier that fights alone , dies alone . These two will do , Mistress . MISTRESS : Good , Kudlak . Send them to me ! In the name of the Emperor , it shall be done , Mistress . ( LAUGHING ) Okay , that 's it . The door to the world championships . - How many lives do you have left ? - Six . You ? Four . I think we 're well ahead of the opposition . Are you ready ? Remember what the manager said . Be ready for a surprise attack . I 'm ready to rock . I 'm ready to roll . Move ! This isn 't the first time I 've had a gun pointed at me . And guns from other planets . I 'm afraid I 've rather lost count . Will you die happy if I tell you that I 'm impressed ? I 'll die happy when I get Lance Metcalf and the other 2 3 children back to their parents safe and well . Don 't worry about them . Children adore war games . ( LAUGHING ) ( GROWLING ) - It 's raining . - They 're powering up the teleporter . Get rid of them , Grantham ! Now ! ( FEEDBACK ) Don 't you have any conscience , Mr Grantham ? Let me tell you about conscience . A conscience is like a stone in your shoe . You cannot begin to imagine the relief once you get rid of it . - Goodbye , Miss Smith . - Just a moment , please . Bit of lippy . Last request . ( HIGH-PITCHED TONE ) Come on ! We have to find that transporter and shut it down . - Do we get like a trophy or something ? - I don 't know . But I 'm thinking this is kind of weird . Come on , it 's just a game . What exactly does a matter transporter look like ? SARAH JANE : Look , it 's Luke and Clyde ! What 's going on ? - No ! - Be proud of them . - Where have you sent them ? Where ? - Into darkness . ( GROWLING ) Looks like things are finally picking up round here . KUDLAK : You 're a disgrace to your own species . Kids from all over must be missing . I doubt that men like you fare well in prison . What 's with all this warrior stuff ? All we did was win a game . - Yeah , we rock . - It 's not Kudlak that calls all the shots . Whatever 's going on has nothing to do with us . - Prepare the recruits for transportation . - Yes , Mistress . - Kudlak doesn 't see it like that . - I 'll be back , Mr Grantham . I 'll be back .

 Okay , okay , I can see him . - That 's it . Here he comes . - Careful . All right . I got him . I got him . - Sensors . - Ahem . - Vitals ? - Stable . - Clamp . - Scissors . Scissors . Severing umbilical . Umbilical cut . Okay , clear . Wait . Dropping , dropping fast . BP 's dropping fast . Respirations are slow , shallow , and irregular . - O2 sat 's down 82 percent . - BP 80 over 30 . He 's in V-tach ! - Get the paddles . Get the paddles . - May I have some Dopamine ? Dopamine . - I 've got the paddles . - Okay . Everybody clear . All clear . Clear ! Heart rate 's stable . Easy . Easy . Okay , we 're good . No physical discrepancies . He 's perfect . Just perfect . I like Melvin . He 's much more of a Melvin . Somehow Ginger and Melvin doesn 't have quite the same ring to it . Okay , then , Fred it is . All right . Come on , little fella . Ahem . Look at that . He 's so cute . All set ? Let 's do it . All right . - Okay . - We 're good . Nice . Ginger , meet Fred . Fred , meet Ginger . - What 're they doing ? - Imprinting . See ? Love at first sight . I wish you guys would fill me in . I like to think we 're a team . I like to think I 'm a sounding board . - You 're much more than that , Barlow . - It 's just another dog-and-pony show . - We could splice a dog and pony . - They can take the meeting for us . Maybe I can help you with your publicity . " If God didn 't want us to explore his domain , why 'd he give us the map ? " Bumper-sticker wisdom . I get it , and I am totally with you guys on every level , but ... Joan Charot can make or break our project without even blinking . We should all be nervous , as in survival-instinct nervous , so come on ... who 's heads up ? I don 't wanna spoil the surprise . Come on . - You love surprises , don 't you ? - No , surprises make me nauseous . Over the course of the last 3 years , our lab has combined ... the DNA from a variety of species to create a completely new life form . And , as you know , Ginger has exceeded all expectations ... in her ability to produce medicinal proteins for livestock . What you don 't know is that , since the birth of Fred ... we have an upgraded splicing technique ... which can be applied to the most sophisticated of organisms , namely ... - human beings . - Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hold on . Let 's not get too far ahead of ourselves . By incorporating human DNA into the hybrid template ... we can begin to address any number of genetically-influenced diseases . Parkinson 's , Alzheimer 's , diabetes , even some forms of cancer . Well ... I can 't tell you how , um ... excited we are . The entire board is thrilled with the progress you 've made ... which is why we are so anxious to move on to phase two . - Phase two ? - The product stage . We need to isolate the gene in Ginger and Fred ... that produces your magic protein . We are shutting down the splicing facilities ... retooling your labs for intensive chemical analysis . - Shutting down ? - I ... I don 't understand . Uh ... we 're handing you the medical breakthrough of the century . - We could begin ... - Elsa ! We all know that can 't happen right now . The moral outrage would be completely out of control . The regulators and politicians , they ... they 'd tear us to pieces . Please . If we don 't use human DNA now , someone else will . Look , we 'd love to go there . Shoot for incredible medical breakthroughs , of course we would . You put a viable livestock product on the shelves ... and then we will talk about a 20-year plan to save the world . Right now , we need to start phase two ... and you are the only ones who can do it . We could quit . Go to Hamilton-Splinter . Newstead owns our patents . We 'd lose everything . Well ? What ? I 'm not spending the next five years digging through pig shit for enteric proteins . Me neither . What 's the profile ? Jane Doe . Anonymous female donor . Clean medical and heredity . The usual . A dime a dozen . One in a million . - It 's not working . - What enzyme you 're using ? It 's not the cleavage . They 're digesting fine . So ? The human Alu sequences don 't wanna bond with foreigners . So what ? We 'll use a ligase other than T4 . We 'll make ' em . Oh , we 'll just make ' em . Yeah , we will , you know why ? It 's because Wired doesn 't inter with losers . Sometimes I forget those basic scientific principles . This retarded , fascist , Ã¼ber music is the fucking problem . Got us thinking in circles . You 're right . We have been dancing to the wrong beat . Try this . M3 . It 's not working . - Wait a second . It 's happening . - Why ... Why now ? I don 't know , but they 're on fire . We got the right temperature ... - and the enzyme ... - They 're changing partners . - Everyone dances with everyone . - You are Bob fucking Fosse . All right . Biotechnology 's most startling breakthrough in decades ... on ice . Well , at least we know how to do it . Elsa . Elsa , come on . What 're you doing ? Elsa . I 'm too tired for this , Elsa . Come on . I don 't have the energy to play with you right now . Elsa ? I 'm not playing around with you . Come on . Hey ! - Did you recode the locks ? - I recoded the locks . Come on . Open the door . Elsa . Seriously . You see , this is what 's known in couples therapy ... as emotional hijacking . Elsa ? Come on , this is illegal . We 're gonna go to jail for this . Come on , open the door . Human cloning is illegal . This won 't be human , not entirely . - What ? What 're you doing ? - Relax . We won 't take it to term . We just need to know if we can generate a sustainable embryo . - Then we destroy it . No one will know . - What 's the point ? What 's the point if you can 't publish ? To be sure we really did it . To know for sure . You 're telling me you don 't need to know ? This is not so simple . There are moral considerations . Millions of people are suffering and dying with no hope . We might just have the key to saving them . What are the moral considerations of that ? - Fuck . - Exactly . How 's it coming , little brother ? Good . How 's Fred doing ? Our boy is growing up into a fine young man . And phase two ? Hey , don 't worry . We 'll nail that gene . Good man . Double helix . Hey , uh ... I can 't help but ... wonder ... what you and Elsa been so busy with . Building you your very own special friend , Gavin . Thank you . I have been so lonely . Not for long . Come on , come on , come on . Can you not do that ? Can you not do that ? - Hmm ? - Don 't do that . - What ? - Don 't do that . My Zeppelin interpolation , come on . You don 't like it ? Zeppelin crashed and burned before I was born . Check this out . It 's near the distillery . I fucking love it . Yeah , it 's cool . You don 't sound that enthusiastic . I don 't know , I just don 't wanna move again any time soon . We 've been here for 7 years . No , I mean from that place . It just doesn 't seem big enough . It 's twice the size of this apartment . More than enough room for all our stuff . But , you know , for down the road . You are talking about a kid , aren 't you ? - That so unreasonable ? - Yeah ... because I 'm the one who has to have it . Look , I ... I love this place . I don 't wanna bend my life to suit some third party ... - that doesn 't even exist yet . - Come on . Come here . What 's the worst that can happen ? How about after we crack male pregnancy ? And ruin this perfect figure ? - You 're a hypocrite . You 're a hypocrite . - No . You 're a hypocrite . Who is it ? Ignore it . - What ? - It 's BETI . - Holy shit . What 's going on ? - It 's coming out . What ? It can 't do that . It 's not due for months . Well , tell that to the fetus . Oh , God , it 's huge . - I thought you were keeping tabs . - I was . It wasn 't that big this morning . It 's too much pressure . It 'll kill it . Okay , we 're gonna do this manually . It 's not depressurizing . All right . Can you feel it ? I can 't . It 's slippery . It 's ... Aah ! What ? What is it ? - Aah ! - What ? What ? What is it ? It 's stinging . No , don 't , don 't , don 't ! - Latch on . Come on . - No , don 't ! Don 't ! Aah ! Aah ! - All right , hold on . Hold on ! - Aah ! Aah ! Close your eyes . - What ? - Close your eyes ! Hold still . Don 't move . Aah ! Look out , look out . Oh , my God . Hey , hey . Come on , come on . No , no , no , no , no . Oh , God . All right , don 't worry . Hang on , hang on . Okay , come on , come on . Come on , come on . Come on , come on , come on . Are you okay ? You okay ? Good , I 'm so glad you 're okay . What was that ? What was that ? What was that ? ... A mistake . Do you think it 's in pain ? What ? It 's not formed right . We don 't know that . I 'm gonna kill it . Wait ! There 's still a lot we can learn . We can find out how close we came ... to something sustainable . Clive . It 's okay . It 's all right . It 's not all right . It 's wrong . Do we have to do this ? You don 't have to . I 'll take care of it . Jesus , I think it 's dead . What ? Hold this . - Careful , careful . - Yeah , yeah . Yep . I 'll bag it . Well ... at least it 's not in pain now . Yeah . It 's empty . Clive ? Clive ? Clive ? Gavin . Clive ! - What happened ? - It 's alive . Oh , Jesus . No ! Don 't , don 't ! It 'll get out . Shit ! Shit . - Get outta there . I 'm gonna gas it . - Wait . Don 't kill it . Elsa , get out , okay ? I 'm hitting the gas . I 'm not gonna hurt you . In three , two , one ! Clive , I said don 't ! Put your fucking mask back on , Elsa ! Listen to me , Goddamn it ! You never listen to me ! Put your damn mask on ! It 's dangerous ! Elsa , please . I 'm not gonna hurt you . It 's imprinting . You 're really something , aren 't you ? Come on . Come on . Come on , get out . Get out ! Get out ! How about listening ? Are you crazy ? Huh ? Are you trying to get yourself killed ? I had the situation under control . You had it under control ? You 're forgetting why we came here . You know what ? We can 't do that now , all right ? Look at it . What 's that supposed to mean ? Let 's just knock it out with some ether , find out what we 've got . This is unbelievable . I don 't even know what half of this is . Some rogue elements . Junk genes pushing through . Be careful with that . It 's some kinda self-defense mechanism . Or attack venom . None of her animal components have predatory characteristics . Well , there 's the human element . What are these ? - Lungs ? - No . These are the lungs . Tumors ? Well , I guess we 'll find out in the autopsy . Look , this wasn 't supposed to go this far , okay ? It wasn 't even supposed to go full-term . But it did . Elsa , what happened to , " We 're just gonna prove we can do it " ? So , what 're you saying ? You really gonna kill it ? Hmm ? Do you think you can do that ? Look . It 's growing fast . Yeah . It 's aging fast . Days within a matter of minutes . - You think it 's the Ambystoma gene ? - It might be . The point is , this thing 's gonna die soon anyway . We 're gonna get to observe its entire life-cycle in compressed time . We 'll never get an opportunity like this again . So it 's dying . She 's dying . All by herself . - xxx - Thanks . The estrogen level 's been low these days . What ? How long ? What 're you talking about ? What you mean , " these days " ? Gavin , you sure ? Of course . I did all the tests . The progesterone , testosterone , estradiol . It 's all in the logs . I 'm sorry . I 've had , uh ... I 'm a little worn out . So , uh ... I guess that thing , that ... experiment you got going on ... still not ready to talk about it ? How do you listen to this crap ? What is this ? - What were you saying ? - Nothing . Day seven . We 've got H-50 on a diet of chlorophyll , roughage , bean curd , and enriched starch . You 're gonna eat this . You 're gonna ... Just a little bit , please . Okay ? Come on , just a little . Please . Just stop . Stop . Just stay still . She seems resistant to feeding ... though her rapid growth should generate a proportionate appetite . You 're gonna eat it . Eat it . Fuck ! Oh , hell , I can 't take this thing anymore . This isn 't gonna work . This is impossible . - Come on . - Come on . - Bring it over here . - Okay . - Listen , listen . - Eat this . Eat , just eat it . - Good girl . - Good . You 're gonna eat that . Good , see ? Fuck . This isn 't gonna work . She makes too much noise . People are gonna notice . - And she stinks . - We 'll just feed her with a drip . How you gonna feed her with a drip ? She just gonna rip it right out . Come on . Try it . Tracking her feeding habits , we 've determined that the ... H-50 craves ... high-sucrose foodstuffs . Elsa couldn 't make it ? She 's at the lab , holding things together . She 's , um ... not very happy with the new directive , is she ? It was our facility . We were supposed to have autonomy . I know . And , um ... I am sorry . Truth is , if we don 't start projecting profits , big profits , soon ... Newstead 's in serious trouble . We need capitalization if we gonna keep moving forward ... which means that phase two is not just an option , it 's all we 've got . If you guys don 't hit a homerun at the shareholders ' presentation ... with Ginger and Fred , we might not even have that . We won 't let you down . In the first month since her birth , the H-50 continues to evolve rapidly . Emergence of arms and the closing seam that bisects her body ... suggests that she develops like a fetus outside the womb . Early cognitive recognition tests indicate growing intelligence . Still ... her mind remains her greatest mystery . Where did it go ? Where did the bear go ? Yup . That 's it . You done it again . You are such a good girl . You could do this all day , couldn 't you ? Okay . I 'm gonna try something harder , okay ? So , really concentrate . E ~ L ~ S ~ A. E ~ L ~ S ~ A. Elsa . E ~ L ~ S ~ A. Show me Elsa . That 's it . Nerd ? Yeah ! I 'm a nerd . Yeah , you made a connection . You are such a good girl . Oh , my God ! She did it . What 's going on ? She can associate . Why is the cover off her tail ? What is she doing in this room ? Wha ... wha ... You can 't let her out . - What 's the problem ? - What 's the problem ? Specimens need to be contained . - Don 't call her that . - What you want me to call her ? Dren . Dren ! Her name is Dren . Listen , you ... you ... you 're talking to her like she 's a ... You 're treating her like a ... pet . I 'm compiling a developmental profile . She needs more stimulation than that room . Oh , well , that ... that 's great . You know what Barlow said ? They 're renovating this entire wing , tomorrow ! Okay , so we move her to the storage room downstairs . Nobody ever goes down there . How do you know nobody goes down there ? - Have you ever ? - Goddamn door . It 's the best idea I 've got . What you want me to say ? What the hell do you mean by that ? Your sarcasm 's gonna help when we get caught . We 're not gonna get caught . Definitely with breakthrough comes a risk , and they 'll throw these people in prison ! They go to jail because of risks ! So you think they 're gonna renovate the storage room ? Are they gonna install state-of-the-art mop racks ? All they need to do is open the door . You 're gonna risk our entire career ... on the fact that somebody won 't open a goddamn door ? It 's the best idea I got , okay ? What else you want me to say ? I wanna know , why are we taking all these risks all of a sudden ? What is going on ? What ? What are you ... When did you get so fucking scared of everything ? When the fuck did you stop being a scientist ? ! No ! Stop ! You go to your place . Go to your place ! - No , Gavin . - It 's okay . - Get away from me . - She 's not gonna hurt you . Okay , so ... we have to deal with this . Come on . All right . It 's okay , Dren . It 's alright . Shh . Just be a minute , alright ? Shh , shh , shh . - I don 't know about this . - You got a better idea ? Go , open the door . You stop it . Shh . Starting to feel like a criminal . Scientists push boundaries . At least the important ones do . Sticking to a few rules isn 't always such a bad idea either , you know . Nobody is gonna care about a few rules after they see what we 've made . " See what we 've made " ? - Is that what you said ? - Yeah . Nobody can see what we made . Once they see Ginger and Fred , don 't you think the world 's gonna wanna know what 's next . Do you think they could really look at this face ... and see anything less but a miracle ? Oh . Oh , sweetie . Sweetie , you 're sick , oh , no . Clive , she 's really hot . I gotta talk to my brother . I know it 's crazy , but I need your support on this . Do you know what happens if you get caught ? What am I supposed to do if you go to jail ? Do you know what happens to this place , and everyone that depends on you ? God , did you ever think about them ? About me ? Did you think at all , or did you just do what she wanted ? It wasn 't like that . You could 've stopped it at any time . You could 've just said no to her . Try it some time . It 's 105 . This is serious . - You don 't know that for sure . - I know . Okay ? - We have to do something . - What ? What 're we supposed to do ? - Well , we have to take her somewhere . - What ? That 's crazy . Well , then do something ! What ? - Give her a Tylenol ? - Shh . Come on , we 're biochemists , we can handle this . How ? Fuck ! How ? - What you do for a fever ? - Cold bath . Hurry . Hurry ! Come on . Okay , sweetie . Shh . Shh . Okay , I got her ? Okay . Okay , come on . - Try to be still , okay ? I know , I know . - Hey ! Dren , you have to settle down , okay ? - Try to be still . - It 's all right , it 's okay . Jesus , her passages are closing . She can 't breathe . Do something ! - What ? - I don 't know ! - A tracheotomy . - With what ? - Try in the lab . - But there 's no time . Look at her ! She 's dying ! Dren , try to look at me . Look at me ! Dren ! Look right at me . Good girl , good girl . Look at me , look at me . Now try to breathe . I want you to look right at me . Dren , look right at me . Try to look at me ! Please , Dren , try to look at me . What are you doing ? Let her go ! Let her go ! Stop it ! You 're killing her . Let her go ! Let her go , please ! Clive ! Just let her go ! Let her go ! Let her go ! Stop it , Clive ! Let her go ! You 're killing her . You 're kill ... Stop it ! Please let her go ! Please let her go ! She 's breathing . She 's breathing . Those weren 't tumors . She has amphibious lungs . You saved her . But how did you know ? You did know , right ? Yeah . Anyway ... we can 't mess around anymore . We have to clean this place up , make it safe . Yeah . Yeah , I think we can do that . Sweetie , you have been such a good girl lately . I have something special for you . Hi . I 'm Jenny . I like cute guys , fast cars , and funny little creatures like you . She was my secret friend . I wasn 't allowed to have her , so I had to keep her hidden , just like you . Good night , sweetie . She 's had a big day . She 's gonna be out like a light . It 's been a long time . My God , I didn 't even notice . Is that what happens ? - To couples when they ... - When they work too hard ? - Yeah . - Hmm . Hi there . Hey . What do we have here ? All right . We have to be quiet . I ... We don 't have any , uh ... What 's the worst that could happen ? Shit . Here is a couple ... unlike any other we 've seen before . That they are completely unique in the world ... is more than just fate ... more than just luck . It is by design . Now let me present to you the minds behind the design . Splice masters extraordinaire ... Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast ! Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you . Uh ... there 's been a lotta talk tonight about ... advancements in , uh ... multispecies morphogens . We 've talked about our new protein-based compounds ... uh ... disease-fighting agents for livestock . And that 's all very exciting for everyone at Newstead . But let 's be honest . What 's exciting for you people here tonight ... is to see these two creatures , alive and in the flesh . These are state-of-the-art designer organisms , the first of their kind . The origin of a species . Male and female . - Like Adam and Eve ... - Raise the barrier . coming together to enact nature 's timeless story of love . Do something . Uh ... Well ... I think we have to agree that this is a setback ... - in terms of how ... - It 's a fucking disaster . What happened ? Well , it was difficult to examine the remains , but ... uh ... it seems that Ginger has undergone ... certain , uh ... Hormonal changes . Hormonal changes ? She turned into a male . What , just like that ? Changed sex ? But how can this happen ? We ... really don 't know ... but , uh ... clearly , two males caged together and stressed is a ... So your first living hybrid changes sex , and you didn 't notice ? How is that possible ? We can re-create them . There 's no reason not to start over . No more monsters . We don 't have time for that . We need the gene that produces CD-3-5-6 , and we need it ... now . Do you understand ? - We have to get it outta here . - And take her where ? Barlow 's taking over every inch of this place , man . He 'll find it . We find some place , away from everything . What am I not getting here ? What did you expect when you made it ? Didn 't you have a plan ? Listen , brother , we wouldn 't be in this mess ... if you 'd been paying enough attention to observe a fucking gender change ! Where were you , maestro ? I was playing catch-up with all the work you weren 't doing ! - What I wasn 't doing ... - I know a place . - All you had to do was track some data ... - I know a place we can take her . All these years you owned this farm , and you never mentioned it ? - You knew I grew up on a farm . - I didn 't know you still had it . It 's not my farm . It 's hers . - She 's dead . - So is the farm . It 's all right , sweetie . We 'll have you out in a minute , okay ? You know , you can talk to me about your mother . I don 't even wanna think about her . I just wanna understand . If you could understand crazy , it wouldn 't be crazy . It 's okay , honey . There 's nothing to be afraid of . That 's your new home . That 's your new home . Come on . It 's okay . - No , no . - What is it ? What is it ? It 's okay . - It 's just a barn . - Dren . It 's all right . Dren . - Come with us . - It 's okay . Dren ! Dren ! Dren ! Everything 's fine . Everything 's under control , huh ? - Is it really under control now ? - You know what ? I need you to calm down . We just need to focus . Unbelievable . This is the disaster everyone warns about . A new species set loose in the world . Don 't worry , all right ? She 's not gonna leave us . - She just did . - Okay . You know what ? We 're gonna find her . She 's not gonna go far . Shh , shh , shh . Where is it ? Go , go , go . Dren ? Dren ? - Dren , honey ? - I think she 's hurt . Oh , Dren . Ugh . Ey . It 's almost full . Dren ... you must never , ever , run off on me like that again . Do you understand ? Do you understand ? Dren , look at me . That was bad . Bad Dren ! Look , uh ... I 'm sorry , sweetie . I 'm not angry at you . I was just ... I was really worried . Well ... it ain 't the W , but got a kinda ... rustic charm . You okay , Dren ? Hm ? Got a little blanket for you . Aah ! Dren ! Look ... maybe we should move her into the house . No way . Come on , someone 's gonna see her there . No , it 's fine . She assumes this place to be water . Tsk ... She 's upset . Everything 's new . It 'll be okay . Come on , let 's move in . It 's late . Okay ? Come on . You okay ? Yeah , of course . It 's just a house . - This was your room ? - Mm-hm . I thought you said your mom left it just the way it was . She did . Nice of you to show up . Traffic . You will observe protocol . It 's the only way we 're gonna beat this thing . Thank you . Shall we , um ... get to work ? Please , honey , not today . Eat your dinner , okay ? She doesn 't like that stuff . Maybe she wants meat . She doesn 't eat meat . I 'm sorry , is rabbit considered a vegetable ? That was an accident . Come on . Honey ? I know you 're hungry . Eat your di ... What is it ? What 's the matter ? What ? Tedi ... She spelled " tedious " . - Where would she get a word like that ? - I don 't know . She ... she 's telling us she 's bored . She 's been stuck here a week . Did you wanna play a game or something , sweetie ? Holy shit . How did you ... Oh , Dren , I ... I know , but I 'm sorry , you can 't go outside . You know , you just can 't . - Dren ! No , Dren ! Stop it ! - Hey , cut it out . - Dren , stop it ! - Dren , o ... okay , take it easy . - Okay , hey , wait ... - You know what ? Stop it ! That 's it . You come over here right now and sit down ! - Sit down ! - Elsa ! Cool it . - You saw what she did ! - Come on . - Did you not see what she did ? - I did . - It 's okay . - Fuck ! Stop , it 's okay . It 's okay . - It 's done . - She 's getting so hard to control ... I can 't control her ... Dren , stop ! Be careful . - Dren ? - Dren ? Dren ? - Dren ? - Dren ? Dren , come back here ! Dren , sweetie ? Come on , sweetie . Come back inside . Dren , we 're not angry . - Dren , get back here this instant ! - Watch it , watch it , watch it ... - No ! - No ! Dren ! Dren , don 't . We need you . Dren ... we love you . Come here . Elsa not here yet ? Not feeling well . Oh , you gotta be kidding me . People get sick . It happens . A lotta people would just suck it up , you know , rise to the occasion ? You guys are not some special case ... anymore . Fucking idiot . My mother wouldn 't let me wear makeup . She said that it debased women . But who doesn 't wanna be debased every once in a while ? Look . You see how pretty you 've become ? You 're gonna have to learn how to be a grownup . I remember how I felt at your age . It 's an exciting time . I never thought it ... Maybe we could use some , uh ... more eyeliner , hm ? Let 's try some more eyeliner . What are these ? Did you do this ? They 're really good . Are there any of me ? Dren , what is that ? Where did you get that ? Give it to me . Give it to me , right now . Dren , give it back to me . Sorry . You can 't keep her . We can 't take a chance , alright ? It could make you sick . Can 't always get what you want . That 's a part of growing up too . Elsa ? Dren ? Shit . Hey . What 's the matter , girl ? What happened ? Did Elsa do that ? Looks nice . Well , let 's lighten things up around here , huh ? That 's good . That 's really good . Ah-ha . You like that ? It 's music . It 's fun , huh ? Come on . Come on , come on . It 's music . Come on , it 's just music . Feel that ? It makes you feel good . Feels better . Yeah , yeah . Let it all in . Let it out . Yeah , come on , come on . Feels better . Good . Very good . Good . Yeah , that 's dancing . Okay , that 's kinda a dance . Okay , look , look , look . Look at my feet . Watch my feet . The feet . Okay , ready , one ... Look , you 're doing good . And step , step . Very good . Ooh , look at you . I knew we have the dance gene in there somewhere . Give me your hand . Hold my hand . Good . That 's nice . Okay , hand there . Put it here . Very good . Okay , I 'm gonna lead , okay ? I 'm the man , I lead . The man leads , okay ? So back up , back up , one more . One , that 's it , that 's it . Good , good , good . That 's it , one more . Good . Back up , back up , good . Yeah . Yeah , turn this side . Okay , good , back up , back up . Okay . You 're a good dancer . You 're very good . Look at you . Elsa . No . That 's enough . That 's enough dancing , Dren . Good night . I thought ... I would take a quick nap . I must 've slept like a rock . What ? It 's your DNA . What ? In Dren . I can tell . You put yourself into the experiment ? How could you ? What ? What were you ... ? I mean , was this ever about science ? Of course it was . It still is . If you really believe that , you 're even more fucked up than I think you are . Uh .. what ... what is that supposed to mean ? Maybe you ought to take another look at your family history . Dren ? Dren ? Hey , Dren . I have something for you . Come here . Come here . I wanna give you something . Can you smile for me ? You know I love you , don 't you ? You 're a part of me . And I 'm a part of you . I 'm inside you . I have something for you . Look what I got . You can keep her . Why not ? It 's nice to have a pet . Oh , my God ! Dren ! Physically , H-50 evolved well . However ... recent violent behavior suggests dangerous psychological development . Erratic behavior may be caused by a disproportionate species identification . Cosmetically human affectation should be eliminated wherever possible . Due to her unstable condition , it has become necessary ... to remove her zootoxin glands and stinger . - What 're you doing ? - What I had to . Jesus Christ . Elsa . She 's become unstable . She killed the cat . She almost killed me . So you cut off her tail ? You any closer to finding the protein ? What 's that have to do with anything ? You haven 't , because you 're working with tissue that 's been dead too long . - You don 't know she has it . - Of course she does . She has everything Ginger and Fred had and more . Where you going ? I 'm gonna solve this thing . I 'm gonna put things right . Dren , I 'm sorry . Dren . I realy am ... Where are you ? Bill , you 're early . Let me get this straight . You stay home because you 're sick , and now I find you sneaking around when no one 's here . - Making up for lost time . - It 's too late for that . They won 't extend the deadline . It 's over . You screwed us all . In fact while you here why don 't you clear out Clive 's desk . I don 't think so . Well , no one cares what you think anymore . You 're an embarrassment to this company . It 's because you ... The protein 's been synthesized . It 's in the fridge . When some real scientists get here , have them take a look . Ouch . Elsa ? No , no ! No ! No . You can 't do that . You ... You shouldn 't do that . You shouldn 't do that . Oh , God . Oh , shit . - El ... - Don 't . Don 't . - You think I know I had some ... - There some things you do not do ! We changed the rules . You 're not talking your way out of this . We crossed a line and things got confused . Confused about what ? Right and wrong . Right and wrong . Do you have any idea how naive that sounds ? You 're in no position to talk to me about right and wrong ! And you are ? Really ? Why the fuck did you wanna make her in the first place ? Huh ? For the betterment of mankind ? You never wanted a normal child ... because you were afraid of losing control . But an experiment , that 's something else . I love her . Yeah , I know , but we fucked up , El . We fucked up . Jesus Christ . We chained her up . We locked her away from the world . Maimed her . I maimed her . I ... just wish things could go back to the way they were . I synthesized the protein . What ? She has a derivative . It 's more stable than CD356 . It 's 10 times higher than the level Ginger and Fred ever had . We could maybe save things . I don 't mean us . I mean ... Oh , God , we can 't do that . We can 't . We have a responsibility . Experiment 's over . Our responsibility is to end it . Dren ? Dren ? Come out , Dren . Dren ? - Clive ! - What ? What 's happening ? I don 't know , but she 's dying . Do you , uh ... wanna say anything ? - Almost done ? - Yeah , almost . - You hear that ? - Yeah . What ? Gavin , what 're you doing here ? I 'm sorry . I had to . It 's the only way . All right . Let 's see it . - What did you tell him ? - I didn 't have to tell him much . You think I 'm stupid ? The samples you gave me had human DNA content . They didn 't come from Ginger and Fred , they came from something else ... something that 's still alive . And you did this on my watch . Now , let 's see this thing . It doesn 't belong to you . - It doesn 't belong to anyone . - Then where is it ? Fine . I 'm calling a forensic team . She 's already dead . It 's over . - I don 't believe you . - No ? Well , see for yourself . She 's buried behind the barn . Oh , shit . What the fuck is going on ? Dren ? Gavin ! Gav ! Gavin ! Gavin ! Gav ! Gavin ! Gavin ! Clive , stop ! - Shit . - We have to go back ! Clive ! - Gavin ? - We have to go back . Clive , Clive , Clive . - It 's outhere ... Look , he 's gone ... - I cant ... - I have to ... - he 's gone . Okay look , we can 't stay here , okay ? It 's out there . What happened ? Ginger . The same thing that happened with Fred and Ginger . - Okay , now , let 's go . - I 'm not leaving my brother . Okay , now . He 's dead , okay ? - He 's already dead ! - I 'm not leaving my brother ! Let 's go ! No . No ! - Just let it go . Clive ... - We need it . - let it go ! - We need it . Aah ! We gotta go . Almost . Almost got it . I got it ! Clive ! Clive ! Clive . Clive ! Clive ? - Clive . - Grab my hand . Grab my hand . Grab it ... Okay , come on , get up , we need ... we need to go . We need to go . We need to go . It 's okay . Okay . Okay . What do you want ? What do you want ? Inside ... you . Your Dren turned out to be ... a cauldron of unimaginable chemical mysteries . Aside from the intense concentration of CD-3-5-6 in her system ... she was filled with a variety of completely unique compounds . We 'll be filing patents for years . Of course , we are extremely excited ... that you 're willing to take us to the next stage ... especially ... in light of the ... personal risk . We think the figure we 've come up with is very generous . You can never speak of this ... to anyone ... ever . Nobody would blame you if you didn 't do this . You could just put an end to it and walk away . What 's the worst that could happen ?

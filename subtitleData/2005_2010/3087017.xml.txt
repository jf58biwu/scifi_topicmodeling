 chapter TWO donot look back ( Mohinder ) We all imagine ourselves the agents of our destiny , capable of determining our own fate . But have we truly any choice in when we rise ? Or when we fall ? Or does a force larger than ourselves bid us our direction ? Is it evolution that takes us by the hand ? Does science point our way ? Or is it God who intervenes , keeping us safe ? Easy , buddy . Where am I ? You 're in a hospital . What happened ? You don 't remember ? [ sighs ] No . You jumped , Pete . Jumped ? Yeah . Off the roof of a 15-story building . You tried to kill yourself . You were a little wound up yesterday . But I thought you were just being you . What are you talking about ? I didn 't ... I didn 't try to kill myself . You were in the alley below . I jumped , and ... then you ... You flew . I what ? You flew up and you caught me . You jumped ... Peter . 25 feet to a fire escape . I climbed up and carried you down . That 's what happened . The rest is just crazy talk . You understand ? Dad ... you mind if I talk to you about something ? You pregnant ? What ? No . You doing drugs ? Dad ! Actually ... I already know what it 's about . You do ? It 's about wanting to know who you really are . Your mother told me that you 've been asking about your birth parents . Well , I think it 's time that I knew . Well , I have a few questions first . Not the least of which is why now ? I 'm just wondering , that 's all . You know , what they 're like , what they can do . What they can do ? Yeah , like hobbies and ... skills . You know , I don 't ... mean this to be condescending . Even though you 're gonna say I 'm being condescending . But I really do believe that this is an adult decision . You 're right . That is condescending . Claire , there are gonna be issues . You 're going to have issues . They 're going to have issues . It 's very complex , emotionally . Yeah , well , so am I. Well , exactly . Look , here 's my advice , if you 'll indulge me . Just ... keep things light and fun as long as you can . Like cheerleading . Being a cheerleader is hard work . Hard , treacherous work . Of course it is , sweetheart . I don 't wanna be late .

And I can 't watch you die too . So you need to make a choice . Me or this . It 's not about having big hands . Most guy 's hands are too rough to pick out the details . Mine are sensitive .

What do you mean you don 't know ? I mean I don 't know . I just--I woke up , and they were dead and ... I think that I might ... Sometimes I look in the mirror ... and I 'm not sure it 's me that I 'm seeing . Maybe it was DL , you know ? He 's trying to protect you because he still loves you and Micah . DL wouldn 't risk coming back . The cops are after him . And once Linderman finds out they 're dead , it 's not gonna matter who killed them . He 's gonna come after me . Then you need to listen to me . Niki , you have to call the police . No , I gotta ... I gotta cover my tracks . And then I gotta run . I gotta go . Why would anybody wanna tap Papa Saresh 's phone ? Papa Saresh ? Yeah , he told me to call him that after I butchered his name a couple times . I don 't know why someone would want to tap his phone .

My father died four days ago . What ? I 'm sorry , I ... You didn 't know ? He was murdered in his cab . Oh , my God . How awful . You were close ? Yeah ... I mean , I hate cooking for one . So I used to make extra and bring it over , and we would ... eat together , and he 'd tell me about his theories and the map . We were friends . Well ... then you were closer to him than I was . I 'm happy to hear he had someone to talk to . I 'll get you some water . I had no idea anything was wrong . I ... I knocked on the door a couple of times . I just ... I thought he was out , and we were missing each other . I had this book I wanted to show him . What book ? Darwin 's Origin of Species . Thank you . It 's a true first edition . I work at this antique book store , and I found a copy , and I just ... thought he 'd get a kick out of reading it . Well , he most definitely would have gotten a kick out of it . That 's very thoughtful . You know , he told me he was being watched . I thought that he was just eccentric . I like that you didn 't use the word " paranoid . " Do you think that they 're watching you now ? They could have killed me , if that 's what they wanted . For the time being , it seems I 'm more important to them alive . You said that he talked to you about his theories and the map . I need you to tell me everything he said to you . Everything you remember . Everything . ( sheriff ) Girls ! This isn 't a ... criminal investigation . Nobody here is in any kind of trouble . Quite the contrary .

( Jackie ) Thank you . How is he ? Who ? The man Jackie pulled out of the train . He 's got some pretty bad burns . Smoke damage to his lungs , but ... he 's alive . Happy to be so .

They 're gonna put her on the top of the fire truck . They should put her under the fire truck . It 's about the videotape . What ? The videotape ! The tape where you 're , like , killing yourself like 20 times . Oh , yeah , that . Can we just keep it under wraps ? That 's what I 'm trying to tell you .

I lied . For his reputation , his heart was fine . But he 'd had two others before that . Well , I lied about those too . Suicide attempts , both of them . He finally got what he wanted . When he was 23 , he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder . He couldn 't help it . It was just who he was . Why didn 't I know about any of this before ? Your father and I decided not to tell you since the disorder can have a genetic link , and you were always so sensitive . We didn 't want you to worry about it . But you 're telling me now . It can start with delusions of grandeur . Thinking you 're invincible or indestructible . They are irrational thoughts that then turn suicidal . It 's time you took a hard look at your life .

 How are things back there . Oh it 's fine , slow . I 'm glad we 're only a quarter-full . Yeah , same up here . Did you hear something about the weather front ? Yeah , these things used to bother me . The weather ? No , that we 're going to be delayed getting into Paris . Please tell me you 're panning on getting some sleep tonight . I can promise you we 'll be in bed early . Emily why don 't you go out with us . It will be so fun . Yeah , Paris at night . Ze Champs Elysee . Ze clubs . - Ze men with their ... - I will be busy . Now if you please excuse me ladies I have some work to do . Yeah . That 's a hint . Aye Aye . So what 's the deal with the special cargo ? It is some last minute top level I government contractor shipment . It says there 's an armed guard in the hull . That 's a first . What are we carrying ? I 'm not sure I want to know . Well , looks like all the signatures check out so we are free to take it from the S.O.C. It says here if there are any abnormalities involving the cargo area . Abnormalities ? We are to contact a Dr. Bennett and Dr. Sebastian . These were the guys that secured the cargo . They 're in first class . Abnormalities ? I 'm glad this is my last flight . Yeah . Lucas , you need to settle down now . You 're not listening . We could lose Kelly and I 'm not going to let that happen . Would you calm down . You 're making a scene . Now I told you . I will bring Kelly out of stasis when we have a controlled environment . Not before . We all know this is highly unorthodox . We had to move quickly . This is her our , only way out . Unorthodox ? Hey ! She was dying and we saved her . If we hadn 't intervened , she 'd be dead . You god damn well know that . Now , were we able to reach our friend ? Kolinsky 's made all the arrangements for the transport and we 'll see him in Prague . Prague ? I though we had a lab set up in Toulon . Christ , our files have been hacked . That will be the first place they look . We are running out of time ! There have always been risks . But think of the good we are doing . We will save loved ones . We will bring them back . It 's why we all have sacrificed . Kelly knew the risks going into this . That 's easy for you to say . That 's not your wife down there . Is it ? Is it ? Shh , calm down . Sit down . Sit down . Come on , Come on . Now listen to me . I know how you feel . I really do . But do you for one minute think I don 't know what 's at stake . My entire company depends on the success of this project , and I am less concerned about losing one life than I am of saving thousands . So I am not going to let you , or your wife , or some petty little Bureaucrat jeopardize this project . So shut the fuck up and get back to your seat , because this subject is closed for good . Are we clear on this Doctor ? We 're clear . Excuse me . He 's not going to let this go . Don 't worry about it . Dr. Thorp will not be leaving Paris . Not with us at any rate . Excuse me miss , I 'll take a Rum and Coke please . Oh , sorry Burrows . Rude of me . Make that two . Right , how bout a coke . If a little bit of Bacardi were to find its way in there , it would be our little secret , huh . Anything for you , Mr ... ? Uh , Burrows , Truman . But no thank you . And I 'm Frank . Frank Lee Strathmore . It 's a name rich with tradition . My umm , My family ... She doesn 't need to know your family history , Frank . Look , I don 't expect to be tied up long . Just a couple of parking ticket kinda things , really . I mean , how bout you and I meet at the Eiffel tower around Mid-Night ... I 'm sorry to disappoint you but Frank here , he 's going to be a little busy . That 's OK . Truman , if you guys need anything , let me know . Thank you . OK . Truman , Truman . Hmm . I guess that pretty well does it for me . Looks like if you play your cards right , she could be cuffing you later . You 're going to shut up and drink your coke . Hi guys . Hey . My god you are lovely . Hey stewardess . Do you think I could get some sugar with my coffee ? So , is Ally packed ? She 's been packed for five years . The legendary Ray Bashore retiring . So why isn 't she with you on your final flight ? She insisted on staying home to get things ready for our trip . So where are you two going ? Summer vacation with the grandkids then we 're on a slow ocean cruise to Alaska . Just the two of us . That 's so romantic . The ocean cruise maybe , but the kids ? Sounds like a nightmare . Hey , that 's great Ray , really . Thank you . Looks bad ahead huh ? Um , not to worry . So , I can 't wait to go shopping at Chanel in Paris . Courtney says that we have to go to Cartier first , and then we can go to ... Yeah , well , I can 't wait to go surfing in Biarritz . Surfing ? Oh yeah , we 're going surfing . You can go surfing . Good . You and that slut Jackie can go surfing all you want . Wow , hey , Tony 's my friend alright ? We 're here to surf and you know that . And hey , his girlfriend 's a total bitch and you know that . What the hell is it with you two ? I don 't like her . OK ? Whatever . OK . Whatever yourself . Hey YO , Tone . - Yeah ? - Gotta go long buddy . Gotta go long buddy . - Oh , oh , it hurts to get scored on . - Stop it . You 're a child . Wow , nice toss . Hey ! I 'll give it back to you when I 'm done playing with it . Hey . Dude , she cannot take the ball . Obviously she can . Nice toss . - Excuse me Mr. Freeman ? - Yes ? Can I get your autograph ? Ohh yeah , sure , sure . That final putt on the last day of the masters , man , that was poetry . Poetry huh ? Yes . Alright there , here you go . Thank you . Thanks Mr. Freeman . Thanks a lot . No problem . Why can 't they just leave us alone ? You told me this was a trip away from golf and everything that goes with it . I know and it is . Look , I promise that for rest of the trip , I 'm just gonna be plain old Billy , alright ? You won 't even know Long Shot exists . I promise you that . OK . I love that smile . Excuse me Mr. Freeman . Yeah ? Captain Bashore would love to meet you . When he has a break later in the flight , would you mind if he stops by for a visit . Yeah , it 's not a problem . Thank you . You know , while you 're at it , if you 're done fawning over my husband , I 'd love another Bloody Mary . Anna . William . I 'm on vacation . I 'll get you a drink right away Mrs. Freeman . And make sure you put some Vodka in it this time . Cause that 's how I like to tee-off . Hey , there 's no reason to be so rude alright . You know I 'm sure there 's someone back in coach who hasn 't got your autograph yet . Maybe I 'll go back there and give it to them . You knew what you were getting into when you married me . I thought I did . You just keep twirling that little putter of yours . Cause that 's all you 're gonna be twirling this trip . Wasn 't so little last night was it ? You know you 've got the wrong man , right ? Yeah , that 's why Interpol has your picture all over the internet . It 's a classic case of mistaken identity . Yeah . Hey . Hey . Burrows , you can 't treat me like this . I 'm not guilty . It 's not fair . Bouncing me all over the world to stand trial here and there for something I did not do . I 'm not guilty . I 'm not guilty . No , I have a clear conscience . I 'm not guilty . Yeah . What is it going to take to convince you I 'm innocent . An act of god . Now shut up before I make you eat that flotation device you 're sitting on . There we go . We can fly around it but not above it . This is a huge system . It 's about 150 miles east and west of course so it looks like either way we go , we are screwed . It 's either that or we fly all the way back around , but that 's going to add 30 minutes to our flight at least . Paris weather is not good for our arrival . I 'm gonna deviate left and thread the needle . That gap might be our only shot of getting around this system without landing for fuel . Folks , looks like it 's going to get a little bit bumpy ahead . I 'd like you to remain in your seats and wear your seatbelts . We 'll probably be through this in 10 or 15 minutes . Thank you very much . Ohh God . Did you hear that ? Something must have shifted and fell . As you know Mr. Madison , a combined strike team of the CIA and FBI seized the head-quarters of MEDCON Labs in Los Angeles . A number of arrests were made , but we 've been unable to determine the wear-a-bouts of four key individuals . The first one , Dr. Leo Bennett . He 's a head research scientist and founder of MEDCON . Noted for his work with retro-viruses , and synthetic biology . He was investigated two years ago for illegal cloning research , unfortunately , that investigation failed to produce any indictments . So far I 've seen nothing that warrants disturbing the President . Can we get to the point here ? Look , we 're trying to reconstruct Bennett 's hard-drive , and we think there is cause for alarm . We believe Leo Bennett is responsible for the development of a new strain of the Malaria virus . And the containment and transportation of Dr. Kelly Thorpe . Malaria ? Initially we thought it was Malaria . However , we discovered that it was something new , something different . Bennett obtained a DNA sample from a Mosquito native to a remote area in Vietnam which had a 100 % mortality rate within seconds , which then regenerates that same organism for a few seconds or longer , depending on the subject organism . What Bennett has developed is a mutation of this same mosquito virus to restart major organs for an indefinite period of time . Now what you 're saying is that his virus kills organs and then brings them back to life . Not just organs . He apparently was experimenting on the resurrection of the entire human body after death . Oh impossible . I can 't go to the president with this . Jerry , I mean come on . From what we 've uncovered , we believe he succeeded . Ah , hello ? What is going on ? What is happening to me ? God damn it . Jesus , what now ? We have electrical and communication problems . We just had a temperature drop in the cargo hold . This is Concord 239 to base . This is Concord 239 to base . Great , no radio . With this crap for the next hour . Perfect . What the hell is wrong with you ? I 'm sick . I need help . I need help . I 'm a scientist with MEDCON Labs . Where the hell is Dr. Bennett ? I need to talk to someone . I 'm coming out . Don 't shoot . Come out . I won 't shoot . What the fuck . Fuck . Where is she ? Oh god , oh ! I 'm going to go to the bathroom . OK . Hey will you grab me a Diet Coke on your way back ? Sure honey . Thanks babe . Check out that dime . Wow , that is one hot little biatch . Ouch , fuck that hurt . Oh hi honey . So I guess that mid-flight blowjob is out of the question ? Such a dick . Sweetheart ? What ? Come here . What ? What 's wrong ? I mean , what is somebody sees us ? What are you talk ... we 're in a bathroom what are you talking about ? No I ... you know what I mean . You 're Peter 's best friend . So what ? Oh , I 'm sorry . Oh , pardon me . I didn 't mean to scare you . No , it 's ok . I wasn 't paying attention . Sir , you actually need to take your seat . The fasten seatbelt sign is on . Yeah , yeah , um . Can I get you some more coffee ? Ok . Yes , thank you . You 're welcome . Oh , Megan , rhymes with Vegan . I was a vegan . - Yeah ? - For two days . Megan Vegan . It 's actually " Megan " . Right , no , I knew that . Sir , you actually need to take your seat . Ok , yeah , yeah , yeah . I just , you need to be more careful . I mean , people sneaking up on you like that . You know , there 's strange people here . You never can tell what 's going to happen on these flights . - Sir you need to take your seat . - OK . - Thanks , thanks . Buckle-up . - You 're welcome . Jesus . Ha , wow . Cool , huh ? Maybe this little diversion will keep my mind off of your tasteless cheap suit . Would you feel better if I was in a bitch-ass , orange jumpsuit ? Like the one you are going to be wearing the rest of your life . There you go getting nasty again when I am merely offering a criticism of the sartorial horror show you call a suit . However , I do like the shirt . Does it come in a man 's style ? And for your information , the jumpsuits in France are a sort of burgundy . Yeah . Well you should look nice in that color . And now I know what color corsage to get you when big Pierre makes you his wife . Someone sounds a wee bit jealous . Yeah . I 'm going to descend a little . Is it over yet ? Let 's find out . This is Randy . It 's Stacy . I think some of the passengers might have been hurt . How bad ? I don 't know . It 's a mess down here . Well , we 'll do the best we can . Just stand by . Looks like we 're OK for a few minutes . Give them the " go ahead " to check . Let me know what 's what . Well folks , we apologize for the heavy turbulence we have just experienced . It appears as though we 're clear for the moment . However , we are traveling through some unstable air . So as a precaution I would like you to remain in your seats for the time being . At this time , I would only like our flight attendants up and about the cabin . Thank you . Would you make sure everyone 's alright ? Then have one of the Doctors , Bennett or Sebastian , check the cargo situation out with you . The cargo ? I 'll get my tools . Is she ok ? It 's her head . You alright dude . Did you take one ? The fucking bag hit me in the head . Come on , that was fun . It was just turbulence . My god , don 't be such a baby . It didn 't hit you . Relax . What is your problem girl ? Oh , are you scared we 're going to crash ? Relax bitch . Enjoy the ride . Wow , Jesus , pipe down you psycho . Shut up . What hell 's wrong with you ? What ? You are a psycho . You know , and you 're a fucking skank . I 'm so sick of your shit . Stop it ! Everyone just calm down . Take your seats . And you take your seats too . Take your seats . What is wrong with you . We have several warning lights we don 't usually get , even with this weather . It 's probably nothing , but we should look just to see . I agree , why don 't you two go . Both of us ? Right . Well whoever is going , meet me by that exit door . It usually takes a few minutes to get down there and there 's no easy way to go . God damn it . I told you . I told you both ... Hey , hey , hey . Calm down . Just go check on the passenger . If it was a malfunction , Kelly might be dead . Yeah listen , don 't take your eye off him . Make sure he doesn 't do anything stupid . You guys ok ? I 'm fine . But do you think we could move up to business class . I mean , the planes really empty and all ... - He 's kidding . We 're fine . - OK . Thank you . Hey , I am trying to help you out here . She wants you . Make your move . Go boy go . I 'm sorry if this is a problem . No problem . I 'll take care of it . It could be dangerous . Only if you 're afraid of the dark . Come on Burrows . I need to go to the sandbox . What ? I got to pee . No , you heard the PA . Sit down and hold it . Fine . If you should happen to feel something warm , just move a little to your right . You 're like a five year old . Come on let 's go . Easy . Take it slow . Yes , of course . Burrows ? Burrows ? Mr. Burrows , Truman . Oh my god . Alright gentleman . Here we go . Truman . Truman . What ? That little shit . Flight-deck . Captain , this is Megan at door 4L . We 've got a problem back here . OK . How bad is it ? Mr. Burrows , the cop who brought the prisoner on board , was knocked out cold , and his prisoner is missing . Excuse me , have you guys seen a funny looking skinny guy , blue sweatshirt , turtle-neck , walk through here ? No . No ? No ? Alright . Well that explains the communication problem . Fry , Dr. Thorp ? Kevin ? Fry 's not in the jump-seat . My god . This can 't be happening . We need to get out of her , now . Come on . We need to seal the hatch now . Let 's move . Come on . Lucas . Kelly . Oh god . No , no ! Tony ? Tony ? Asshole . Don 't scare me like that ... What ? Hey , where the fuck are you going ? That hurts . And don 't use that kind of language around me . Hey you two . You need to be in your seats with the belts fastened . Why don 't you make yourself a fucking sandwich while you 're at it . What have you done ? You son of a bitch . What have you brought on board ? Take your seats everyone . Take your seats . Everyone just calm down . Do you know what 's going on ? Ray , open up . What 's wrong ? Randy ! Ray , bring the plane down . Ray , bring the plane down . Bring the plane down right now , or we 're all going to fucking die . Tell me what the hell happened down there . Ray . The fucking , the fucking , the fucking scientists , they let something out of the cargo-hold . What are you talking about ? Where are the doctors ? They 're dead . Ray , they 're dead ... - Sit down ! - Look at me man . Everyone 's going to fucking die . They killed them . Sit down and calm down . Sit down . Now . Sit down . What happened to you ? Listen to me . Just listen to me , Ray . If you don 't land this plane soon , you , me , Emily , everybody on this fucking plane is going to die . You know I can 't bring her down without warning and no place to land . Think about it . There is something .. it 's not human , down there man . And it 's going to kill everyone on board unless we land this plane . So whatever you do , I don 't care how you do it , just , just ... - I need you to calm down ... - Find a place , Ray , and land the fucking plane . - Find a piece of straight fucking road . - You know the radio 's gone , and this storm isn 't helping our situation . It 's clear we can try to cross . But I 'm turning around and heading back . There 's a TSA man aboard . Find out which passenger he is and get him up here . Now ! Ray . Are you sure that 's the guy ? Ok , they 're dead . And you say whatever killed them , wasn 't human . I know it sounds insane . I saw this happen . I mean those things , I mean they ripped those men apart and they were eating them . You said there was a fugitive on board . Is it possible you saw him down there ? No . I told you . There were two of them and these ... these things aren 't human . I 'm going to go find out what was in those containers . Where are you going ? I 'm going to go talk to that asshole Bennett cause he knows . Sit down . Well , I 'll check it out and report back . Any sign of him ? No . Shoot . How 's your head ? Better than my ego . Come on , he can 't hide forever . As soon as the turbulence settles , I 'm going to go look for him some more . Don 't go alone . Why ? Is he dangerous ? Well , he 's probably never owned a weapon before , but he 's more of a con-artist than anything . What did he do ? Can you tell me ? He posed as an accountant , skimmed 35 millions of the Russian mob , stole their Jet and crash-landed it . And we finally caught up to him . Everybody wants him . Why are you taking him to Paris ? You ok ? Yes . You should take your seat . OK . Be careful . OK Hey look at this . I think I found Concord 239 . Nobody 's been able to reach them for over an hour . Los Angeles dispatch , this is Yellow-Knife-Center . I believe I have your concord 239 on my screen . It 's in the middle of two huge weather fronts . And transponder indicates it 's off course . No , no radio contact yet . I 'll try now . Concord 239 , Yellow-Knife-Center . Concord 239 , Yellow-Knife-Center . Los Angeles Dispatch , yes I understand . I repeat , you must tell 239 to return to US airspace . The Canadian government will not permit them to land or continue to fly in their airspace . This decision has come from the highest level of the Canadian government as well as the US State Department and the CDC . Is that clear ? Can you tell me what it is you 're transporting in the cargo-hold ? I 'm sorry . My cargo is a highly classified project linked to our nation 's security . You don 't have the necessary clearance . I 'm with the TSA , Federal Air-Marshall . I need to know what 's down there . Well how fortunate for us to have a man with your obvious talents aboard . You seem a bit nervous Doc . Is everything alright ? Just don 't like flying . Isn 't it true your two colleagues accompanied the co-pilot down to the cargo-hold because there was some problem . No , no problem . No problem ? It 's just a routine mid-flight inspection . Routine . What I can tell you , while the cargo isn 't dangerous , it 's highly perishable and extremely valuable . So , the cargo area is off limits to unauthorized personnel . - Well , can you tell me ... - No , I 'm sorry . I 've said more than I should have already . Burrows ? Yeah . Paul Judd , TSA . I believe your prisoner is in the cargo-hold . Ready ? Hey Frank . Frank . Frank . Get out here . Dr. Thorp . Dr. Sebastian . Anybody out there ? That 's a lot of blood . Somebody 's in trouble . Yeah , if it 's Frank 's he needs help now . Check that out . Looks like he escaped through the ducts . I don 't know . That 's an awful lot of blood for a skinny little shit like Frank . You go that way . I 'll go this way . Meet back in 5 . Yes . Hey Frank . You there buddy ? Why don 't you come out and talk to me , man ? Everything 's alright . It 's cool . We can just talk . It 's just me . Frankie . I 'm going to kill that little shit . Alright , I 'm coming up . Yes . You 're sure ? Outstanding . Thank you Lieutenant . They have located Bennett and his team . Hallelujah . You know Frank , sometimes this job is really boring . This is not one of those times , bud . You 're making this real exciting . Son of a bitch . Paul ? Frank ? Oh my god . Oh my god I 'm going to be sick . Oh my god . Cara where the fuck are you going . What the fuck ? Tony , this bitch just got shot dude . There 's fucking bullets coming from somewhere . Please take your seats . Take your seats . Everything 's fine . Please , take your seats . Everything 's fine . Thank you . Ray , it 's total chaos down here . There were gunshots or something that freaked out the passengers . Emily ? Go , take the gun . My god , this can 't be happening . Get back . Go back to your seats and stay there . Go back . Move , move , move , move . Get out of my way . Cara . Cara . Cara , open the door . Move . Cara . Oh shit . Dude , what the fuck ? Get back . Get back . Get back . Get back . Get out of here . Get out of here . Cara . - Stay back there . Stay back there . - Cara . What the fuck , dude ? What is this ? - Christ . - Holy shit . Get off him . Get off him . What the fuck ? What the fuck ? What the fuck is going on ? Please , please , please go back to your seats . Oh my god . Oh my god . Oh my god . Oh my god , what happened ? What the fuck happened ? Please take your seats . Flight-deck . Ray , something 's happened down here . Something attacked one of the passengers , and he 's dead . You got to get us down , Ray . Oh my god . - Megan , listen to me . - You don 't understand . There 's blood everywhere . And , and Stacy and one of the other passengers was hurt . How did it happen ? Who attacked you ? I don 't know , um , maybe the escaped prisoner . I can 't think of anyone else . Look , Megan we 've turned around and we 'll land the first place we can find . But the only way back is through the center of the storm . We need to get the passengers back to their seats now . OK . I 'm scared Meg . Oh , my god ! Shit . Help me . Open . Oh , shit . They 're going to kill us all . I really should go check on the passengers . Open this door . Help me . For Christ 's sake , they are going to kills us all . Open the fucking door . God damn it . Help me . Bill ? Hey . What 's going on ? - Oh , shit . Oh , shit . - What 's going on man ? I can 't explain . We 've got to get out of here . - They 're going to kill us . - Calm down and tell me what 's going on . What is going on , man ? We need to hide . We need to hide . We need to get out of here , or we 're going to die . Bill , where are you going ? Come on , come on . Where ? Back-galley . The floors 2 feet thick . It 's the only safe place . I can 't , I can 't my wife is upstairs . Well get her and get back there as soon as you can . Come on , now . Come on . Hey you , come on . - Help me get this open . - Tell me something . It 's the only place we can find . Shh , shh , be quiet . Hey , you , you get in there . See if you can see anything . Go on . Get up . Get up . See anything ? Help me ! Come on baby . Come on ... Stacy ! Duck ! Oh my god . Are you alright ? No bites ? We thought . We thought ... What ? That it was me gnawing on all the passengers ? No . I 'm a vegetarian . The overall feeling among the scientists working on this is that we are dealing with a serum transfer virus . This virus is without a known vaccine or cure . But this type virus transfers only through bodily fluids . And then most effectively , blood from an infect victim . And it enters a cut or saliva . The MEDCON scientists believed they could make this work , despite the side-effects . That of being brought back from the dead . In fact , they looked at these side-effects as a benefit . Let me paraphrase these notes that we found on Dr. Bennett 's desk . They wanted this virus as a bio-weapon . To keep soldiers fighting after they 've been mortally wounded . To release a captive enemy infected with the virus and let him infect others until they all kill each other . I 'm going to recommend to you and to the president that we destroy flight 239 before it can reach a populated area . Let me get this straight . You want our forces to follow a shoot to kill order regarding a civilian aircraft ? We 've had no communication with the aircraft . We must assume the cargo has been breached and that the virus has spread throughout the passenger section . The only chance we have to contain this is to vaporize every living thing aboard that aircraft . Before the virus can reach a major population center . Do you concur ? I 'm afraid I do . Can you get me the president please ? Mother of god . Get off of her . Get off . Get off . Oh my god . Why ? Why 'd you do this huh ? Hey , I 'm talking to you , man . It wasn 't me . I was just following orders . They told me it was an experiment to extend life . I had no idea there would be these crazy side-effects . Well look around you asshole . Your side-effects have eaten half the passengers . Hey , I don 't have to listen to you . You were the one that seemed like you were giving all the orders . You were the one that the cop was talking to . And you were the one that sent the others below . I heard all of that . You don 't know what you 're talking about . It wasn 't me I tell you . Hey , keep your voice down . Well you just keep talking . You 'll draw their attention . It 's starting to get really tight in here . Yeah , yeah , I think we 're getting closer . Ray . Ray , I 'm hurt . Open up . Hurry . Ray . Hurry . Oh my god . I don 't know if that 's going to work . It has to work . Let 's get the other side . OK . Two in the chest . One in the balls . That 's what I say . It 's barricaded . Ah , Frank I see you . You get that ? He is a little beaver . Come on . - Oh my god . - Come here Frank . Where have you been ? Where have I been ? Where have you been ? Where have you been ? - I have been up and down this plane looking - So have I . Hey , back off . Statistically speaking , the tail section is the safest place to be in a crash . - Of course , no one ... - Frank , not now . Help me with this . Go get something else . - Get something else . - I am . Do it . Right there . I can 't lift . There 's a ... wait . Frank . Wait , wait , wait , shh . Quiet , quiet . I hear something . I don 't hear anything . Go . Hold on . Hold on . Oh my god , baby . OK , we got to go . We got to go . We got to go . Go , go , go , go . Alright , we need to find anything that can be used as a weapon . Does anyone have anything sharp . They confiscated my toenail-clippers . Pearl handled with matching tweezers . Quite lovely . Damn Frank , you should have brought those . You could have saved the day . You never know . How much ammunition do you have left ? I got five in here and one clip . What about you ? One full clip . Five more . Shit . Maybe we could electrocute the bastards . - No , no . - No , no , no , don 't do that . I guess that could have gone better . Frank , you stupid shit . Please tell me you 're dead . Where 'd you find him ? The auxiliary lights ... Oh my god . The auxiliary lights will come on any second . I hope . Frank . We need to find weapons . Still no answer from the cockpit ? Nothing . I can 't believe everyone 's dead . My god , we 're going to die . Megan . Listen to me . Listen to me . - We are not going to die ... - No ? No , we 're not going to die . I promise you . I need your help . I need you to be strong . Right . Did you see that ? What the hell was that ? Listen . Someone 's up there . Don 't shoot . We need to have a plan to get this plane down safely . Does anyone know if the pilot 's still alive ? I , I tried to reach him . Try him again . OK . - Nothing ? - Nothing . The captain is dead . We 're on auto-pilot . So what , - we just fly around till they get us ? - - No . Or until we run out of fuel . Actually , that might be preferred . - Run out of fuel ? - Yeah . Hey , we got to get to the flight-deck to check on the captain . We got to do this now before they start coming at us . I don 't think you have enough bullets to make it to the cockpit . The guard down below has a weapon . We need that weapon . That 's our only chance . - Absolutely . So what ? You 're just going to go down there ? Down there . How do we know he didn 't use all the ammo already . We don 't know , Frank . It 's good to know that you still have a sense of humor in a time like this . I know it 's not much to look at but with any luck , it 's going to buy me enough time to get that weapon and get back here without tearing the plane apart . Why are you doing this ? I made a promise to someone . I keep my promises . I have radar contact with Concord 239 . Should have visual in two minutes . Burrows , in case this blows up anything important , do you mind if I take out your new girlfriend ? Hey Bennett . Got something for you . Roger . Try to establish contact . You have three minutes from my mark . Mark minus three minutes . Roger that . Mark minus three minutes . Try to establish contact . I 'm going to circle and signal . Look . I 'd like to think that 's the Calvary , but um . What do you mean ? We don 't have much time . Well , aren 't they going to save us ? No . They 're not going to save us . There 's just us . Unless we let him know we 're alive , he 's going to shoot us down . They can 't do that . He 's right . Unless we answer them , they 're going to fire the missile at us . What do we do ?

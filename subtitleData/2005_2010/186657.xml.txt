To the top of the countdown now , when we conclude with a wild tale of what lies beneath . Do you think it could be a leftover dinosaur ? Partly . Within six months , we will be on the brink of an ecological disaster . Want us to bring ' em in ? ( announcer ) But Lee will do anything to shut them down . We 're past that . [ knock at door ] Front desk , I have a fax here ... ( announcer ) Now Surface continues . [ softly ] Wait ! ( Daughtery ) What ? Nobody knows we 're here , who 's gonna be sending us a fax ? I don 't know . Ann , or the network , or something ? All right , tell them to slip it under the door though . Yean , can you--can you slip it under the door , please ? I need a signature , ma 'am . Since when do they need a signature for a fax ? Get that latch . Rich . Hold it . I am ! What are you doing ? I 'm leaving ! Come on , come on , come on , come on . It 's tight . It 's tight . 4th floor , room directly below . All right , they 're gone . Come on . Okay . Check all the stairwells ! Well ? No one 's in the hall . But , you know , I think we should wait it out . They ain 't gonna be fooled for long . We 're better off making a run for it . I 'm telling you . Come on , let 's go . [ whispers ] There . Keep going ! Okay ! Go ! Wait , what ? Get out of here , go ! Get going ! I 'll catch up . [ garbled radio transmission ] What happened ? Let 's go . Cab . Where to ? Anywhere . Just keep going . I 'll tell you where in a second . My God , Rich , is that a gun ? Yeah . Shh . What , is that blood ? Are you bleeding ? It 's all right . Ain 't my blood . All right , let 's see who we got here . Agency of Strategic Intelligence . Agent John Goldman . Well , I guess it 's official . Come on ! It 's time to go ! All right . I guess . Remarkable . No indication of a bite wound at all . Temperature 's normal . So what was it , Mitchell ? You said you 'd know better once the lab results were in . F.U.O. ? What 's that ? We 're still calling it a Fever of Unknown Origin . Meaning , you have absolutely no idea what happened . You lucked out . Well , forgive me , but that 's not very reassuring . Mom , could I just have a moment alone with Dr. Ashton ? Oh , um , sure . So I was just wondering about the unknown origin part . Mm-hmm ? Is it possible that my fever was caused by some physiological change ? Maybe a tissue anomaly . Like a collagen vascular or granulomatosis disease ? You were just wondering this ? I looked some stuff up online . Miles , we had a pretty intense scare , you and I. So just tell me , what 's on your mind . Is it possible that if some weird thing bites you , that your body changes ? Like , you become like it in some way ? You 're 14 , Miles . Your body changes daily . Some of those changes are pretty strange . We don 't need any granulomatosis disease , or anything else to explain it , it 's just life . Stand up . You 're fine . Perfectly normal . Hey , Laura , where have you been ? I 've been trying to get in touch with you all morning . I know , uh , we couldn 't really get to a phone . Well , the feedback from the show has been phenomenal . Countdown was bombarded with all sorts of emails and responses ... Oh ... oh , my God . Rich , are you okay ? Yeah . Something 's happened . I don 't understand why these people would be after you . No , not just people , okay ? We 're talking about the Agency of Strategic Intelligence . Did they show a warrant or a subpoena ? Um , no , these guys were more like , uh , the mob . What were they gonna do ? I mean , the story 's already out there . They can discredit the story . We 're the only living witnesses . That 's right , it 's the living part they got a problem with . Wow , okay , uh ... This is getting scary . And interesting . Let me go to the office . Make some calls . Jack Cooper at SOCOM . Wait , wait , Jack Cooper ? Who 's that ? He 's a Marine colonel . A friend I can trust . Someone who might be able to make some sense out of this . But you don 't tell him we 're here . No , you have my word . Okay . And in the meantime , you guys make yourself at home . Not much in the fridge , but it 's all yours , okay ? All right ? I 'll call you later ? Thank you . Wait , we ain 't answering your phone . Well , uh , I 'll ring once and then let it hang up , and you pick it up after that . That 's good . All right . Thank you , Ann . Thank you . [ door closes ] You really think they we 're gonna kill us ? Damn right , I do . All I can think about is just Jesse . When am I gonna see Jesse again ? That 's all I can think about . We 've been through this , all right ? You wanna see Jesse , I wanna see my little girls . But we both know if we try to contact them , we 're only putting them at more risk . I mean , they found us at a dang hotel , for goodness sakes . I know . You 're friend , she 's asking the right questions . Did they have a subpoena ? No . They give us a search warrant ? Uh-uh . I 'm telling you right now , those guys would 've thrown us off that balcony , if they 'd half a chance . They probably killed Jackson . You don 't know that . Where the hell is he then ? Why hasn 't he tried to contact us ? We are on to something big . Something bigger than my brother , something bigger than a new species . Okay ? So let 's think about that . When we think about our kids . Hi , Caitlin , right ? Yeah , is Miles home ? Yeah , he 's upstairs . I 'll get him . No , it 's okay . [ door opens ] Caught you . Pornography ? Um ... algebra homework . Want to see something cool ? Sure . Okay . What ? Um ... nothing . Just , um ... My parents have this rule , we 're not supposed to keep the door closed if there 's , like- - What ? Like ... a girl over . I mean , not that anything 's gonna happen . You never know . Okay . Check this out . So , I know you 've been missing your sea monster . I hooked you up with your own personal webcam of the aquarium . So you can look in on him . I felt bad , ' cause I mean , it 's actually kind of my fault that they 're not letting you see him , so ... Thanks . Oh , there 's this great party at Wrightsville tonight , if you 're up for it . School night . My parents have all these rules . God , don 't let the rules stop you . Hey , Ms. Barnett . Let me know . Oh , my God . I have 81 new messages . Holy cow . I guess people are starting to talk . Yeah , but what kind of people ? " End of days . " " Fear the quickening . " " Creatures killed Kennedy . " Look at this one . " North Carolina Killing . " It says the guy was attacked in Wilmington . His fingers bit off , his eyes fried out . Oh , boy , here we go . What 's this nut saying ? Wait , what 's this ? " Have you seen this ? Plausibility T. Figurehead . " ( Rich ) Hey . Rich , that 's the one that was in Cirko 's office . Mm-hmm , it 's the flower . Should we reply to that , or ... ? What ? No , you didn 't just ask me that . You should know by now , anything can be traced , anything . So , you think it 's a trap ? No , but that doesn 't matter . We gotta sit tight , okay . Just ... I feel like the story 's out there . You know , it 's viral . I mean , you know , this person obviously knows something . Doesn 't matter . I 'm replying . Aw , come on . Now see , you shouldn 't have done that . You shouldn 't have done that . Tell you right now , that wasn 't a good idea , I guarantee it . There 's no SWAT teams coming through the window . Give ' em time ! ( Rich ) Shut it down right now . Come on , let 's not be stupid , huh ? Hey . That 's new . Do not answer that . Hey . See , that 's exactly the type of high-tech stuff I 'm talking about . Now see what happens ? Rich , you don 't know that . ( Rich on Computer ) That 's exactly the type of high-tech stuff I 'm talking about , now see what happens ? ( Daughtery on Computer ) You don 't know that . All right , that 's a trace . That is a trace , shut it down . Shut it down . ( deep computer voice ) Answer . Adenine . Cytosine . Guanine . Thymine . And ... What is that ? ( deep computer voice ) Answer . Guanine , Thymine , and ... Uracil . ( deep computer voice ) Correct . Dr. Daughtery ? Hey . Yes ? Who is this ? ( deep computer voice ) I saw your story on MSNBC . Uh , how are you ... how are you doing this to my computer ? ( deep computer voice ) Not all technology is in the public domain . I was very interested in your comments on Liopleurodon . How did you sequence the DNA ? I have tissue samples . ( deep computer voice ) I would be very interested in examining the samples myself . Would this be possible ? Uh , sorr--who is this ? ( deep computer voice ) A friend . A friend . [ whispers ] This is crazy , man . ( deep computer voice ) I can 't divulge my identity . I have a need for anonymity . Perhaps you have experienced a similar need . No . No way , man . No deal , buddy . ( deep computer voice ) If I wanted to harm you , I could find easier ways . What the hell is that ? It 's us . I don 't want to harm you . Okay ... What do we get out of it ? ( deep computer voice ) Answers . I 've left something in the city . As a token of my good will . Do not digitize this information . 100 Leary Street . Get a pen . Get a pen . ( deep computer voice ) The code is 576.0162 . The code for what ? ... A-R . The code for what ? Hey ! Hi . How 'd you get the hall pass ? I told my mom we were study partners . And from different schools . That 's a--that 's a bold choice . Caitlin , how you doing ? Hey . They your friends ? Yeah , they go to Eisenhower with me . Must be fun . Eisenhower , I mean . Like you don 't have parties at Del Mar. Not on Monday night . No , not so much . Caitlin ! Hey . What 's up ? Miles , this is Lionel and Mark . Lionel and Mark , Miles . 'Sup , dude ? Hey , you guys want a pull ? Nah , I 'm good . Hey , wanna go swimming ? Absolutely not . It 's freezing ! Caitlin , that 's the point . No . All right , we 'll check you guys later . Okay . Bye . Later . They 're the first two guys I met when I moved here . They 're idiots , but sweet idiots . So , where are we going ? Uh , I don 't really know how to sail . Don 't worry , it 's not like you need any special training or anything . So , are you cold ? Not really . You 're supposed to say yes . Damn ! Ow . Okay , that was weird . I 'm--I 'm sorry . No , not your fault . It was probably just the static off the mast or something . Where are you going ? Ow ! Okay , what 's going on ? Miles , what 's wrong ? ( Lionel ) Mark ! Mark ! Jonathan ! Where are you guys ? Something 's wrong . Turn it off ! Turn off the music ! Mark ! Where are you ? Mark ! What happened ? Mark and Jonathan ! They went under and they never came up ! I tried to find them , I swear ! Mark ! ( Lionel ) Mark ! Mark ! Hey , don 't go out there ! No ! Something 's in the water . Mark ! Jonathan ! 100 Leary Street . Wait a minute . We 're being given the gift of literacy ? Explains the code . Huh ? How 's that ? Dewey Decimal System . 26 , right ? 576 over here , here you go . Here you go , right here . Where ? Here , here . This--this should be it . Okay . Right ? What 's this ? Yeah , this side , yeah ? Ah , here it is . Origin of Species . Okay , let 's see . Is that it ? No ... Dammit , how 's this supposed to help us out ? Lemme see it . Rich ? Rich ? Rich ? Uh , all right . ( Daughtery ) Look at that . Look , there 's fake IDs . What is this ? Credit cards ? And let me see this . Look it 's got our photos on it and everything . He must 've taken stills from the news piece . That is a terrible picture of me . Wow , look at that phone . Look at this thing . Hello ? ( computer voice ) Dr. Daughtery , please . Okay . It 's for you . Hello ? Hello , Dr. Daughtery . Why are you doing all this ? I wanna create good faith . It is a gift . The phone you have in your hand is untraceable . You will find debit cards wired to an unlimited bank account . Quite helpful if you 're a fugitive . Listen , uh , we can 't accept all of this . Please accept it as a token of appreciation for what you have done so far . What have we done ? You 've survived . That 's an accomplishment . If you 've given us all these things , there 's obviously something you want in return . I told you , I would like to get a look at the DNA samples of the species . Why ? They will enable me to answer certain lingering questions that I have . Questions about what ? Questions of the agent who- - Who ... Framed thy fearful symmetry . I 'm sorry , I just don 't understand what you 're talking about . I 'd rather not discuss it this way . Face-to-face ? And perhaps you could bring the samples with you ? Would you be interested ? I--uh- - Good . Thank you . I 'll be in touch with arrangements within 24 hours . Um ... What ? What 'd he say ? What 'd he say ? I have no idea . ( boy # 1 ) Jonathan ! ( boy # 2 ) Mark ! Jonathan ! Mark ! Jonathan ! ( Miles ) What are they doing ? They 're just trying to see if they didn 't get drunk and pass out in the dunes somewhere . They weren 't in the dunes , they were in the water ! They 're just trying to do something . ( boy # 1 ) Mark ! Mark ! Jonathan ! Hey , hey . We found something ! No ! No ! They found something . Come on . Aren 't you coming ? I know what they found . Miles , Jared , I need you . Thanks for coming back , Miles . I came in this morning at 7 : 00 and found a lab tech collapsed near the door to the tank room . Attacked last night . By Nim ? He 's out of his tank , Miles . Totally out of control . What 'd you do to him ? Nothing . No one can get near him . ( Miles ) Where is he ? Um , Sean , hi . Uh , it 's Daughtery . Well , I guess you can see me . I 'm not used to these . I 'm sorry , um , listen . Um , I , um , I 'm sure you 've seen the MSNBC thing by now . I got a film of ( both ) the new vertebrate . ( Daughtery ) And it was on TV . Um , and as you know , um , there 's something very strange about the way the government is responding to it . And , um , Sean , I need a huge favor . You know , um , Carolyn Pizzoli at Berkeley ? Um , she has tissue samples , okay , that I need . Um , and she 'll know which ones I 'm talking about . And I need you to go to Berkeley and go see her and get them . And bring them to me , okay ? I will text you an address where to meet me . Don 't tell anyone that I 've contacted you . And please , most importantly , tell Jesse that I love him , and I miss him dearly with all my heart , and show him this , and tell him what I said , I love a goodnight . He 'll know what that means . [ sighs ] Help me , Obi-Wan , you 're my only hope . [ chuckles ] Bye . That was last night . A little after 9 : 00 . He was just making his rounds . He wasn 't doing anything to provoke him . Is he okay ? The guy ? ( Jared ) 11 stitches . But , yeah , it looks like . I mean , he wasn 't threatening Nim in any way . We 're at a loss as to what prompted this . ( Miles ) Same time as the attack on the beach . Miles , Miles , what- - what are you doing ? It 's a wild animal . Miles , you can 't go in . It 's too dangerous . Nim won 't hurt me . ( Miles ) Come on out , Nimmy . Nim ? Nim , it 's all right . It 's me , Nim . It 's Miles . What 's it doing ? I think it 's purring . Sean , Sean . Hey . Hey . The samples . Any luck ? Oh , thanks . So I guess this means you 're not taking Jesse on Saturday . You know I can 't . You know that I want to . But I cannot . That 's a real funky way of showing it , Daughtery . You 're really living up to your maternal responsibilities . Come on , man , look . You know what ? There 's a lot of things going on right now you just don 't understand , all right , man ? Is that a gun ? [ scoffs ] What the hell 's wrong with you two ? You 're both nuts . This is- - Sean , wait a second . Sean . Sean ? Listen to me , Sean . Look , I know you don 't understand this right now , but you will , I promise you will . You know what , you should know something , Daughtery . Cheryl and I are getting married . That 's--that 's great . Congrat- - Congratulations , Sean . That 's awesome . Yeah , hopefully it 'll give Jesse some stability . Oh , almost forgot . This ? That 's from your son . What can I say ? Everyone who knew Jonathan remembers the smile he always had on his face . His ability to see the good , regardless of the situation . It 's amazing how he could lift the spirits of someone . Just by being near them . ( man ) Thank you , Laurie . And now Jonathan 's brother Stan . Miles . Why are you sitting all alone ? I don 't really know anybody . You know half the town . And you know me . I looked for you today at the aquarium . I left messages . I know . You didn 't call back . What 's going on ? I-I don 't know . My dad said that you 're the only one that does know . Don 't . Don 't touch me . I 'm sorry . No , I 'm sorry . It 's just--I 'm--I 'm sick , Caitlin . I 'm sick . Uh , I- - I- - What ? Nothing . Miles . Look , it 's crossroads Rte . 5 and 21 . Mm-hmm . Well , this is it . Hey , look , look , look . [ plane approaching ] Mr. Connelly , Dr. Daughtery . All ready ? I guess so . Ready as we 're ever gonna be . Oh , I 'm sorry . There must be some miscommunication . I thought , we thought it was understood . The invitation was for Dr. Daughtery only . Oh , yeah , that 's a huge miscommunication . Because it 's both of us or nobody . Well , I 'll take good care of her , Mr. Connelly . She 'll be right back here in 24 hours . ( Rich ) No way . I look stupid to you ? No chance in hell . ( pilot ) Very well then . I 'll pass along the message . It was nice to meet you both . Rich ? Huh ? No , don 't be an idiot . Come on , I mean , I have a good feeling about this . Remember what that guy said ? He would 've harmed us if he wanted to . We don 't know anything about that guy . ( Daughtery ) Remember what you told me ? ( Rich ) What ? I tell you lots of things . Yeah , you told me that we need to persevere and try to find out what the hell is going on here . Because what 's at stake is our families . Your girls , Rich . My Jesse . That 's what this is about , right ? Right ? [ sighs ] I don 't like it . I don 't like it . If you don 't mind , I 'm gonna have to ask that you wear this blindfold until we reach our destination . I 'm sorry , but it 's the only way . Um ... Okay . There you go , now just watch your elbow there . All right . ( Jared ) It started again . We were observing , he seemed fine . Then all of a sudden . Hurry up , butt wipe . ( Savannah ) I know you 're in there , Miles . Go away . Well , will you just hand me my red T-shirt , then ? [ Savannah knocks ] Hello ? [ knocks ] Hello ? [ jiggles handle ] You look rough . Yeah , you too . Why do you always have to take everything the wrong way ? ( Dr. Blum ) Anybody else in there ? ( Jared ) No , it 's secure . ( Savannah ) You 're turning into a real monster , you know that ? ( Savannah ) Mom ! Get the tranq darts ! He 's killing himself ! [ low growling ] ( Pilot ) Step , step . There 's a landing here . Step . Okay . Now . It 'll just take a second for your eyes to acclimate . But just try to relax . You 're safe here . Uh , when do I get to meet Mr. Big ? Soon enough . What 's that ? Whoa , whoa , wait . I need to sweep you as a final precaution . Legs apart , please . But , um ... After all that you 've put me through , you really think that I 'm here to bust you ? That which we intend is not always that which we accomplish . Just ask Lisa Meitner . Lisa Meitner ? Austrian physicist , right ? ( Pilot ) Uh-huh , yup . She escaped the Nazis in 1939 , and went on to discover nuclear fission . She envisioned a world made prosperous by unlimited atomic energy . Instead , they hijacked her research to develop an atomic weapon . You 're him , aren 't you ? Who ? Mr. Big . ... information regarding this creature- - ( Sheriff ) How long has the thing been here ? A week ? A month ? You didn 't tell anybody . ( Dr. Blum ) We had no idea what it is . We didn 't know it was the same species that attacked those boys . We get a report about this kid over by Drawbridge ? 14 or 15 . Hospitalized just last week in another attack . This thing is starting to become an epidemic ... It was you , wasn 't it ? The boy who was hospitalized was you . ( Sheriff ) Give us something to work with here , you gotta help us a little bit ... It 's okay , Miles . No , it 's not . Whatever 's going on with you , I wanna know . Believe me , you don 't . Miles . I don 't normally do this , you know . Throw myself at some guy . I mean , I 'm kind of out here on a limb for you . Miles , stop . If you want me to leave you alone , just say so . I don 't . I really don 't . What then ? Whatever your secret is , I don 't care . Really . No static . See ? You 're fine . Gotta take my Statin . I have an APOE E4 allele that I 'm heterozygous for . You have the gene that increases your risk of heart disease ? Mm . I was messing around with my own code one Sunday , and there it was . The gene ? Mm-mm . The corporation wouldn 't approve . What corporation ? You don 't need to worry about that . There really is no corporation . It 's a long story . Samples . I thought this was a whole , you know , government cover-up- - There is no government cover-up . Of course , I 'm sure there are agents within- - What ? But the government is largely ignorant of the scope of the situation . So you work for this non-existing corporation ? Yes . After a while you start to wonder if maybe you don 't exist . The samples ? Right . Sorry . Here . Here 's , uh , here 's my part of the deal . And then your part is to just give me some answers . Um , does the corporation have a name ? Not a name . There 's hundreds of names . Shells within shells . The worlds left to plunder aren 't out there anymore , they 're in here . Okay . But what 's your specialty ? RNA enzymes . I alter them . To do what ? To function like scissors . Snip out flawed gene segments . Splice in corrected new versions . I envisioned a world where tissue could self-repair overnight . Maybe not in my lifetime , but someday . You envisioned a world where your work would be used for good . Yeah . Silly me . Those are my artificial chromosomes . In your new vertebrate . I 'm sorry , did , um ... Are you saying that this- - Are you saying that this creature was designed ? I prefer the word engineered . Um ... You built this thing ? Me , and--I 'm just guessing here--about 2,500 others . You made this animal . Why ? Why would you- - Why would you do such a thing ? Because we could .

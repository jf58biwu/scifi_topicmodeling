 Torchwood , outside the Government , beyond the Police . Tracking down alien life on Earth , arming the human race against the future . The 21st century is when everything changes . And you 've got to be ready . This programme contains some strong language . The speed of light is 299,792,458 metres per second . Pain travels through the body at 350 feet per second . Even a sneeze can reach 100mph . And as for life , well , that just bloody whizzes by . So then , this is me , Eugene Jones . Hey , Gwen . Jack ! Er , Tosh ... The guys at the rope just let me through so ... I 'd say at least 50 miles per hour . Travelled on the bonnet , bounced , maybe rolled , smashed his face on the road . Hey ? Um , excuse me , but that looks a lot like me . He couldn 't even cross the road without messing it up . No bag - nothing . I mean , what was he doing here ? Perhaps he was hit deliberately ... Maybe he really did have something important . Like what ? I don 't know . He was always trying to talk to us , show us stuff . Perhaps we shouldn 't have been so ... Gwen , I think it 's just an ordinary RTA . Guys ? It was a red car . There 's red paint under his fingernails . Am I dead ? Am I dead ? Am I dead ? Yes ? Hello , love . I 've just been to the shops and forgot tea-bags . Hello ... ? Eugene ? Hi , Mrs Jones . Something 's happened . We need to talk to you . What happened ? How did I end up here ? I mean , I 'm dead , but I 'm not dead . So ... Shit ! So , what ? Am I a ghost or a zombie ? Oh , God . Right , calm . Yeah ? Stick with the team . What ? You 're driving . This is Torchwood , it 's going to be OK . Oh , what ? ! Of course , I 'm invisible . Why am I invisible ? Anything on his phone from today ? Just some pictures of random shoes . Mind you , it feels kinda familiar . You know what , whatever 's happened , all of a sudden , I 'm somewhere I 've always wanted to be . Let 's back up a bit . I mean , every story 's got a beginning . I think mine began here ... The final of the Interschool Maths Competition , 1992 . I used to be a maths head . Binary coding , topology , quadratics , I loved stuff like that . And I 'm supposed to be really good at it . And Rushmore , a mountainous 42 ... So we congratulate the winning team - Rushmore ... Dad took the day off work to come and see me , but when the moment mattered , I blanked , let the side down , made a mess of it . Everyone blamed me for losing the final ... .. but it must have been what happened afterwards that started this whole thing off . Have you ever had a proper look at the collection ? No , sir . Would you like to ? No , sir . I play golf . Oh . Good , sir . I play golf . And one day when I was playing really badly ... I was stuck in the first bunker whacking away at all the sand ... .. and this fell out of the sky , and landed - plop ! - beside me . From the sky ? Yeah . It looks a bit like a golf ball , so I picked it up and put it in my pocket . But when I had a proper look later ... Here . I realised it was an eye . And I thought , well , " Where could that have come from ? " It fell from the sky . Isn 't that amazing ? Have it . Where the bloody hell have you been ? ! Good evening ... Good evening . Come on , Eugene . Have you got everything ? Yes . Thanks , sir . I went to the school , didn 't I ! 'Dad was mad at me for losing the final . 'But now I had the eye . 'And what I realised was , if it fell from the sky , it probably ... ' No ... No , it almost certainly belonged to an alien . That was the night Dad went away . But it was OK , because I had the eye , and the possibility of an alien encounter . I mean , if you leave something really important behind , you come back and get it . Don 't you ? I wanted that alien to come back and claim his eye more than I wanted anything in my life . I worked out the possible provenance , the life form and galaxy , planetary escape velocities , launch windows , necessary fuel capacities , and then , I waited . ♪ There 's a star man waiting in the sky ♪ He 'd like to come and meet us but he thinks he 'll blow our minds ♪ There 's a star man waiting in the sky ♪ He 's told us not to ... ♪ My dad never came back . As I got older , I became interested in UFOs , collected alien artefacts , watched the stars and waited alone for my alien . 'And then , 'I found you , Gwen Cooper . ' Hi , I 'm Eugene Jones and , er , I have a keen interest in your work and , er ... I 've got something to ... I 'd just like to show ... Hi . Hi . OK , what it is ... Look , I 've got to go . 'But I couldn 't quite make contact . ' Hmm , you again . Gwen , I 've got this thing I really need to show you . Sorry , that sounded ... 'I couldn 't get you interested in the eye , no matter how hard I tried . ' Are you sure it 's my Eugene ? Yes , Mrs Jones . Perhaps you couldn 't really identify him . We could . That 's his tea there . Shit ! What are we doing here ? Look at this . Do you understand what 's happened to your brother , Terry ? Yeah . What ? He walked into a road and got run over . Where 's your dad ? He works for a big corporation in America . Gwen ? That 's pre-Gorgon Pilurian currency . I had them authenticated . Are these Roman coins ? Hey , look , Rice Krispies . Man , there are some rogues out there . Oh , hang on , there 's something missing here . Mrs Jones , do you know what 's missing from Eugene 's collection ? Why didn 't they stop ? They killed my boy and just drove on ... Excuse me . I am sorry , Mrs Jones . Look , Mum , I 'm sorry , but we 've got the best team ever working on this . Torchwood , me - top ! We 'll get it sorted , Mum . See , I think there 's probably been some mistake . So ... So ... I gotta go . I want to know what he last ate , where he 'd been ... Oh , wow ! This is ... This is ... I am totally ... Christ almighty ! The Head of Vexor 11 . No way ! And ... Wow ! A hand ... In a jar . What was he doing out on that road ? Fuck knows . Categorising chevrons . He was a geek . Ah , this is truly legendary . Gwen , he had a bit of a thing about you , and now you 're feeling guilty . Sod off , Owen . You do it , then . I do it ? The autopsy ? Yes . I 've got a stack of admin . OK . Good . You 're sure ? Yes . Really ? Yes . I am in heaven . Am I ? Is that ... ? Number three scalpel . Start at the sternum . Piece of piss . OK , here we go . This is also new to me , but in an investigation like this ... OK , a red Vauxhall has been stopped outside Caernarfon . Very drunk guy has admitted knocking a man over near Cardiff . Fit 's Eugene 's description . The man says he thought he 'd be OK , so he drove on . Ah , he was a sweet guy . That 's very sad . Now , can we get on with some proper work , please ? ♪ Hope there 's someone who 'll take care of me ♪ When I die ♪ Will I go ? ♪ Hope there 's someone who 'll set my heart free ♪ Nice to hold when I 'm tired ♪ There 's a ghost on the horizon ♪ When I go to bed ♪ How can I fall asleep at night ? ♪ How will I rest my head ? ♪ I 'm scared of the middle place ♪ Or paralyse in light ♪ And godsend I don 't want to go ... ♪ Do you think Eugene committed suicide ? It was a road accident and there was no alien involved . See , I 'm not so sure because something seems really odd . I mean , I just ... I just feel that there 's something going on . Marvellous . Thank you for that Disney moment . Now , who 's making the tea ? I suppose Eugene 's a bit odd and a real local and amateur for you . Why is it that only Gwen seems to have a heart ? I don 't know if you 've noticed but the rest of us are human and amazingly we still manage to get on with our jobs . OK , you two ... OK , fine . Leave it , forget it . I have . Is that Eugene 's DVD ? No . Yes ! It was on loan from a video store . You were nicking his stuff ? I was going to take it back . I 'll do it . Suits me . There 'll be a fine . I 'm going to go for some lunch . All right . Hi . Do you know when the video shop round the corner opens ? No , he 's a law unto himself . Gwen ! What are you doing here ? This is my lunch cafe . This is ... Do you know someone called Eugene Jones ? That 's me ! That 's me . Middle height . Sandy hair . Ordinary looking ... Nope . What can I do for you ? I come in here every day . Two eggs , ham and chips . Two eggs , ham and chips , please . So ... Wow , this is so weird . I used to follow YOU around . Now you 're following me ! Yeah . No , you see , I don 't know whose those are . I can 't remember anything , except ... Phone Gary . He might know something . Phone Gary , phone Gary ... 'Hi , this is Gary . Please leave a message . ' Hi , my name is Gwen Cooper . I have some very bad news for you , Gary . I 'll give you a call back later . That is so beautiful . These ancient creatures have had their day . All over these lush fern prairies a grim evolutionary battle has broken out among the newer types of reptile ... Hello . Hi , gorgeous . Want to borrow a dream ? No , thank you . I want to return some DVDs on behalf of someone who 's deceased . Deceased ? No shit . That 's pretty final . Eugene Jones . Hey , I think he used to come in here , with a mate . Bit of a dreamer , kind of ... Irresistible ? Ordinary looking . Yeah . He was killed in a road accident . That 's bad . Sweet guy . £ 34 , please . £ 34 ? ! Yeah . Sorry . He 's had ' em out ages . I haven 't seen him in months . I don 't think I can bend the rules , just cos he 's dead . Bread-head bastard . Sorry , Gwen . That 's OK . Did he , er ... ? Did he walk into the oncoming traffic ? See , lot a people come in here . They don 't want to be themselves any more , they want to be someone else . They want me to transport them . How about you , baby ? Oh , leave it out . I 'm fine , thank you . How about you ? Me ? I 'm outta here . Moving to London in a couple of months . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? You see , no disrespect , but Eugene had " loser " written through him like " Brighton " in a stick of rock . Maybe he just couldn 't live with his ... failure . You wanna write a cheque ? Failure ? Is that right ? Has my life just been one big failure ? I mean , maybe I never quite lived up to my early promises of maths genius , but that 's because I was waiting for the alien to collect his eye and change my life . And while I was waiting , I joined Passmore Telesales . Oh , yes . This is all nauseatingly familiar . 'Selling kitchens , home insurance , barbeque sets . 'Selling life and ... still waiting . ' Jason ! Kevin ! The guy with the personal hygiene problem . Nothing changes , really . Hi , Morag . Me and Morag used to go out . So , how come I can remember the details of my fascinating daily life , but the vital couple of weeks before I died are still a complete mystery to me ? Are you Gary ? Yeah , yeah . How do you , er ... ? Are you ... Gwen , yes . I was just wondering whether you saw Eugene the day he died . No . Sorry . Just doing a card . You know ... " Good luck in your new job " ? ! He 's dead . No ! Who 's it for , then ? His mum , you idiot ! Shit . Can you rub it out ? It 's in Biro . People just don 't understand . Don 't worry , mate , it 's OK . Is it true ? He got run over ? Yeah . Oh , God . Sorry . I 'm Linda . I 'm a Silver Seller . It 's all about belief , see ? If necessary , I am Kitchens For A Lifetime . Eugene was only ever himself . He wasn 't the best salesman then ? No . I think Craig kept him on out of the goodness of his heart . Have you met Craig ? Is he your boss ? Are you two an item ? A snog in the ladies at the Christmas party . But I can 't talk about it here cos of Craig 's , you know ... position . Do you want to meet lunchtime for a chat ? OK . Where does Gary sit ? Number 50 . OK , thank you . Thanks . Owen . ' Gwen , Jack wants to know where you are . ' Yeah , sorry . I had a few things to sort out . I 'll be back later . ' Yeah , well , make it quick . ' Well , one day Eugene came in , very low . Why ? Why was he low ? He wouldn 't talk about it . Anyway , I was fed up too because Craig had ... Well , anyway , I said , I 'd love to get away from it all and go to Australia . Eugene suddenly got very excited . He said , " Yes ! You 've got to go . " I said , " But I haven 't got the money , " and he said he 'd get it for me . So he was going to pay for a ticket for you to go to Australia with him ? Was he in love with you ? Oh , no ! He loved someone he said was unattainable . He was just trying to look after me . He said , " Don 't stay here and waste your life waiting for something that may never happen . " Where was he going to get the money from ? Exactly . You said , " You haven 't bought socks in six years . " I said , " You haven 't even had a new pair of socks in six years . " He stood up , and he said ... That 's your phone . Yeah , he said ... ? He said , " I 'm going to sell it . " I said , " What ? " He said , " My alien artefact . " So ... ? So ... ? So he brought it in to work . It 's a plastic eye ! It 's an alien body part , and I 'm going to sell it on eBay . Eugene , it 's very nice of you , but I don 't think that 's going to get me the bus into town , let alone a flight to Sydney . Some people laughed . But he went ahead , and of course , it just sat there . She said maybe a photo , a bit more of a description ... Then , out of the blue - £ 2.50 . A kid from Birmingham . And then ... Eugene , you got a couple more bids . Bloody hell ! 75 quid ! That was just the beginning . 200 ... 300 ... 1,000 ... They just kept on going up . £ 3,000 ! For a spare body part . Pete said you can get a bathroom suite with a celebrity appearance for less than that ! Then one day , it just ... jumped . Oh , my God , Eugene , you 're rich ! £ 15,005.50 . Who bought it ? Who bought it ? I 've no idea . Is it all my fault ? Of course it 's not ! I 'm sorry . Hello ? ' Hi , it 's Eugene 's mum . ' Mrs Jones ? ' There 's something I think you should see . ' OK . I 'll come over . That was Eugene 's mum . Sorry , I 'm going to have to go . I 'm sorry . There he is ... my son at the Interschool Maths Final . Big moment . Youngest contestant in Wales . So , it 's down to the wire , the last question will settle the final . What curve is represented by y - squared = 4ax ? Come on . You got a brain the size of Cardiff Arms Park ! What 's the friggin ' problem ? ! What curve is represented by y - squared = 4ax ? Don 't do this . Don 't let me down , boy . No ? Time 's up . No additional points . The final scores are ... I don 't understand . Someone gave him the eye as a consolation prize ? Yeah , it was that Mr Garrett , the science teacher . A plastic eye ! As a consolation prize ! Still , Eugene treasured it . That was the night Dad walked out . Went away . You can stop now , Mum . What do you mean ? He 's dead . He may have been able to square the root of the square root , but he couldn 't cross the road ! Terry ! He sold the eye online . So something must have happened . Dad left when he found out Eugene was a failure . That 's what Eugene said . None of that 's true . He went cos of his job . He has a very important job . Does Mr Jones know about Eugene ? Well , you see , he works for a big corporation in America . Stop giving us that shit ! He 's not Superman , Mum ! He works at a garage on Filey Road . Eugene found him about two weeks ago . He found him on the internet . He 's a cashier . Works nights . Oh , God , now I remember why I sold the eye . Life can be such a let down , can 't it ? All those years I 'd believed my dad had gone to America because I was a failure . And here he was , all along , doing his important secret work in Filey Road , Cardiff . When I found him , I couldn 't even bear to say hello . I 'd spent my life believing in stupid stories , fantasies . I 've wasted my life . Once I 'd seen him there , everything I 'd dreamed about was like rubbish , just a crock of shit , including the eye . So why not sell it ? Along with the woodworm treatment and loft insulation , and all the other crap floating round the world . Linda was welcome to the money . No ! No ! NO ! Don 't , Gwen ! I don 't want anything to do with him . I 'm sorry . It 's OK . You turned your phone off . It was Eugene . He didn 't understand why his father left . He just needs a bit of help . To do what ? He 's dead ! Yes , Jack , I know he 's dead , but ... This is not sounding good , Gwen . I 've got work to do . OK . Eh ? No . You can 't just stop . I mean , what about the £ 15,000 ? Gwen ? Gwen ! OK . Listen to this . Eugene had an alien eye in his collection . He sold it online . What , like a sixth eye ? A Dogon sixth eye ? Maybe . It 's possible . There was a trade in them . Who 's got it ? I don 't know , but I 've nearly tracked it down . What exactly is a sixth eye ? I mean , exactly ? It 's one in the back . Let 's you see behind you , where you 've been . Kind of puts things in perspective . It 's useful , fun , slightly terrifying , that 's why they were in demand . See ? See ? I told you . I can get it for you . My alien ... See ? See ? OK , you 've got the weekend . But keep your phone on . God , you are brilliant . And I 'm brilliant too . Oh , yeah , of course , Gary and me were going to go to that talk in Aberystwyth . Black holes and anti-matter were pretty important to me and Gary , but if I 'm going to spend a night by the sea , I know who I 'd rather be with . I 'd trust you with my life if , you know , I still had one . Gary ? I 'm not proud of what I 've done . You hiked the bid ? I created three or four online aliases , and used them to inflate the price . But why ? At first , just to cheer him up . He was miserable . But then the bidding took off and we got ... I mean , I was involved at first . I was just helping Eugene make money , and then one morning ... Gary ! Gary , I think it 's him . Who ? The alien . My alien . I think he 's come back to claim what 's rightfully his . Gary , I 'd stopped believing in him . I mean , I thought I was just a total sucker but ... Who else would be bidding this kind of money for a prosthetic eye ? He couldn 't contact me any other way . So he chose eBay ? Cyberspace . I mean , even an online auction has a certain elegant symmetry . I think I 'm finally going to meet him . Well , I was doubtful at first , you know , and then suddenly , out of nowhere - bam ! 15,000 . I mean , the bid jumped to a cool cowin ' 15,000 . Yeah . Yeah . I remember us talking . I thought it was £ 15,005.50 . Yeah , it was , yeah . I mean , I wouldn 't spend that kind of money unless it was my own personal private body part or something . Would you ? No . No . No way ! I remember , yes . I waited a couple of days and then I got an email telling me to come to , er ... come to a restaurant . You saw Eugene the day he died , didn 't you ? Yeah , I met up with him before he went to meet the alien . I had a cup of coffee . He was scared . Was I ? Course I was . So he went to make the exchange - £ 15005.50 for the eye , right ? And this was somewhere on the A48 perhaps ? Or not . Or not ? Eugene was very secretive . Could have been in Splott ? Splott ? That doesn 't sound right , mate . Who are these people with you , Gary ? Why would Eugene take a photo of your shoes ? And , whose are the other shoes ? They 're just random shoes , I should think . I miss him . Yes , yes , I can remember ! I called a taxi , and then , then I put the eye in a freezer bag . And then there was ... Yes , I was walking up this road going up towards ... um , a shiny building with ... a great door which said something about ... something about ... Happiness . I don 't want you to find out what happened . I don 't want this to end . I love you . I thought we were on holiday . Yes . Yes ... this is it . We came up the hill , and there it was ! There it was , the ... The Happy Cook ? Yeah , I walked towards the door , wondering who exactly I would be meeting , excited , quite stressed , shitting myself frankly . I opened the door ... I walked in , and saw ... I 've been looking for a pair of shoes like that for ages . And saw ... And saw ... my mates . Hi , guys . Good to see you , but erm ... I 've got the rendezvous . It 's us . I know but ... he won 't want a crowd . I 'm meeting the buyer . I 'm meeting the alien . We ARE the alien , man . We bought it . What ? Here . What are you having ? Erm ... I 'll have a milkshake , thank you . Banana . Yeah . So we are the official buyers . Can we see the merchandise ? I don 't quite know what you 're trying to tell me here . See , we did it as a joke to cheer you up . We didn 't think we 'd be the actual buyers . Then he said you said you thought it was the alien , and we thought ... well , that 's funny , innit ? Come on , Eugene , get real . But then we thought , " Let him dream , man . " Life 's short and really boring . " So then we went on betting and then ... You bid 15,000 for the eye ? Not us . No . No way . It turns out there was real interest . Someone else bid the fifteen thou , but then HE got greedy . Ketchup , please . He just couldn 't resist one more measly little bid . £ 15,005.50 . And then , well nothing . Nada . Endville . OK , shut the fuck up , Gary . Point is , we bought it . We are the purchasers . Ta-dah ! So you 've got £ 15,005.50 on you , have you ? We 've got £ 34 . £ 34 , Eugene . That 's not a poke in the eye , so to speak . I 'm calling a cab . Hey slow down . Banana milkshake ? Thank you . If it 's all such a sodding joke , why do you even want it ? I got a friend with a visual impairment . You 're going to re-sell it online , aren 't you ? You cheap little gits . You know he 's out there ... Who ? The alien , and he 'll pay anything . Eugene , man , I 'm as partial as the next guy to a bit of sci-fi but ... A green geezer with six eyes ? Get real , guy . I checked the bid history . Mr C Blackstaff is a collector of alien ephemera and Nazi memorabilia . Also beanie babies . Teeny bit cuckoo , but endearingly rich . And if he 's willing to pay 15,000 ... Oi ! So now they 're inconveniencing customers . You stepped in ? Well , I tried . I didn 't really know what the eye was any more ... .. but I was damned if I was going to let it go for £ 34 and a banana milkshake . Heimlich ! Heimlich ! What are you doing ? Getting the goods , idiot ! Get the milkshake ! Well , that 's just not acceptable behaviour . Not at a Happy Cook . They were making a public spectacle of themselves . And that was it , he was out the door and gone . Oh , my God ! That is so weird ! You bastards ! You are so dead ! I mean , Josh , you 're just a dickhead , but Gary ... We were ... I mean , we were mates . Hi , doll . Are you talking to me ? Yeah . Sorry . Look , I don 't know whether you remember us from last week . Yes . Yeah , now the thing is , there may be people coming in to ask questions . A woman specifically . And I think ... Josh ... it would be in your best interests if ... Shut up , Josh . The woman is complying , man . OK . Cool . What did you do that for , twat ? I miss him ! So he ran out the door and you two ran after him ? Yeah . We chased him across the car park . But Eugene was quite fast . Josh had new shoes , he was making a fuss ... Hey , hey ... You are overweight . He hared across the road and we lost him . Honest to God . OK . That 's it . OK . All those cars . All those lives moving through space ... Hello . Can you give me the number for Filey Garage , Filey Road , Cardiff , please ? All that humanity whizzing by in a frenzy of burgers and chips , bank holiday fun , burst tyres , screaming kids and sudden heart-attacks . Put me through , thanks . Mr Jones ? You don 't know me , but I 'm a friend of your son Eugene . I 've got some bad news , I 'm afraid . Now I remember . Apart from a buzzing in my ear where Josh whacked me , I felt good . I was running across a field on a Saturday morning . The smell of exhaust and banana milkshake , a slight nausea , heart beating too fast cos I wasn 't that fit - all the stuff that tells you you 're alive . By rights , I should be well pissed off - my mates had cheated on me and I didn 't meet any aliens , but I realised that when I swallowed the eye at the Happy Cook , I was given a chance to look back on my life and see it for what it really was . Gary , I 'm going to miss you . Not the biggest turn-out you could hope for , but still . I wish I could ... God , Gwen , I wish I could say thank you . And here he is ... .. my dad , only 14 years late . So , now I know it wasn 't my fault my dad left , and that , of course , he wasn 't Superman or an alien , he 's just an ordinary bloke . Eugene ... He was a good boy , but somehow ... things went wrong . I wasn 't there . I wish I could have seen him ... before ... An ordinary bloke who made a mess of things . ♪ Oh , Danny Boy ♪ The pipes , the pipes are calling ♪ From glen to glen and down the mountainside ♪ The summer 's gone and all the flowers dying ♪ Tis you must go and I must stay behind ♪ But come ye back ♪ When summer 's in the meadow ♪ Or when the valley 's ♪ Hushed and white with snow ♪ And I 'll be there ♪ In sunshine ♪ And in shadow ... ♪ No ! Not yet . Dad made a mess of things and went away , and that 's a shame really , it 's a terrible pity , because we missed each other . Completely . You know , 28 is one of those perfect numbers . It 's equal to the sum of its divisors . I 'm 28 . I was 28 . I think I 'm going to have to go soon , Gwen . Oh , God . Yeah . Also , 28 centimetres per second is the top speed of a lone lobster . Oh , hi . Thank you . I 'm sorry I had to ask you to do that . Yeah , no problem . So , if it 's the eye that 's been keeping me here , now it 's no longer inside me , why the hell am I still hanging around ? Eugene ? The eye is in the bag now , rather than in you . Are you ... ? Hello , stranger ! Did you get it ? Yeah , I got it . Impressive . Well , we haven 't done the tests yet , so ... Come on . We 've got to go . Jack , can you give me five ? Yeah . In an average lifetime , the human heart will beat two million times . You 'll produce over eight thousand gallons of saliva and grow 350 miles of hair . You 'll eat the equivalent in weight of six elephants . Oh , isn 't life amazing ! Gwen ! GWEN ! Hi . Oh , my God . Eugene ! Are you OK ? It is so good to see you . Eugene , you 're on my leg . Sorry ! Sorry . No , no , it 's fine . It 's fine . It 's fine . It 's fine . Can he see me ? He can see me ! Thanks . No , thank you . Thank you . You just saved my life . That 's OK . That 's unbelievable . That 's un-bloody-believable . Oh , God ... I think that 's it . Goodbye , Gwen . Don 't go now , Eugene . Eugene , please don 't go now . Eugene , please ... Please ! The average life is full of near misses and absolute hits , of great love and small disasters . It 's made up of banana milkshakes , loft insulation and random shoes . It 's dead ordinary , and truly , truly amazing . What you 've got to realise is , it 's all here , now . So breathe deep and swallow it whole . Because take it from me , life just whizzes by , and then , all of a sudden , it 's ... At least it wasn 't a spaceship full of aliens . Which year ? I need to know . 1953 . Just three lost people who 've somehow become our responsibility . A man like you , out of his time , alone and scared . I hate this filthy stinking place ! I died once . It 's like two separate worlds . There 's Torchwood ... then there 's real life . I 'm scared .

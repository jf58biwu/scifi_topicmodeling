 Go forth and multiply . Procreation is the fundamental act of faith . We divide even as we conquer . And is it losses on the field of battle ? No . It is in the battle of love . So I turn my weapons to the task of evolution . Case in point . I transform two men 's semen into armies of conception ... by exposing them to the same ray : Aldous B. Sadly , one dies . The other buries him with honor . The ray is imperfect . Some will die . But the alternative is the death of the entire human race . We have already evolved so much . Our actions would be incomprehensible to a human from 1,000 years ago . It 's the evolution revolution . Tomorrow we speed up the process . All sectors ... all species . Only the strong shall evolve . Thanks for hitting me . For a moment there I thought I was dreaming . As usual . Put the control down , Aeon . Just gently put it down . And let you kill off half the planet ? I don 't think so , Trevor . The ray will be fatal to only a small minority at most . It will strengthen the strange , like you and me . If we 're all doomed , what will you live for , Aeon ? There . That 's a longtime dream of mine . Sorry I can 't stay to enjoy it . Where are you ... All right , you don 't have to answer that . I know someone who 's just going to love you . Bit much . Let 's go . I 'm getting you out . Found us a sack of bones , eh , doggies ? This ain 't the one we came for . What 's the matter ? Running away is a sure sign of guilt , if you ask me . Where 's your mouth ? Look ! It got no mouth . Easy , sleazy . Moving slowly , and nobody gets hurt . No apparent bodily orifices anywhere . Well , how the hell do they do it ? It certainly would be worth finding out . I guess one would have to be inventive . Exposure to Aldous B. Very odd . Fatboy , I must do some outside research . - Watch the alien . - Just watch it do what , exactly ? Someone scaled your eyes , Fatboy . I didn 't know you were so impressionable . It 's my fault . They came here to see me . Your ego is staggering . What 's this got to do with you ? These creatures have died from exposure to Aldous B. Somehow it shot from the satellite to their ship . Nice going , Trevor . Making friends all over the universe . They had to find the source of the ray . But the ray killed them first . They lacked the resilience to survive . We need exposure to Aldous B. We must remain a virulent strain . You 've made your sick bed . Who else are you going to ask to die in it ? As a matter of fact , I feel quite guilty . It looks like our survivor must have been the navigator . Not a scientist or a general , just a foot soldier . It 's got no idea what to do here on our planet . That escape pod out there was a hibernation chamber . It was supposed to sleep till the cavalry arrived . - Which turned out to be you . - " It " is all he is to you , I suppose . " He " seems more like a " she " to me , if you really want to know . - And I want to help her . - Help ? Her ? Sure . I know what kind of help you have in mind . Look who 's talking ! I 'm sure you want to know , too . What would it be like ... with an alien . Do you think it 's anything like this ? They don 't have one of those , or these . Would you like ... Oh , sure , of course . Cheers . It 's all right , go on . Oh , my God . No ! I am sorry , but there are some things even I won 't do . Here , let me show you how we ... You 'll be back . I don 't think so , sweetheart . You 'll definitely be back . Why am I bothering to save these people ... with their secret appetites and sorry needs ? The alien , by contrast , is remarkable . She relies on no physical sustenance . No need for air , for food , for water . She does not defecate or perspire . She lives in the mind . Her feelings are real , more intense than our own . Her language of pictures ... is at once more poetic and more precise . She needs no one else , but she wants someone else . This will be my evolution . Programming for itinerary , complete . Anticipated duration of voyage is 523 years ... two months , five days , four hours ... 19 minutes and 32 seconds . And the return trip ? Return itinerary has not been programmed . - I could kill you right now . - Oh , come on , Trevor . You could kill me anytime . I 've always wondered why you don 't . Right now , so do I. Look , Trevor , put that gun down . No . The alien 's using you , Trevor . Can 't you see that ? How can you stand to be controlled ? I would rather be under control , than out of control like you . - But , of course , I am in control . - Wrong again . It seems to me that I have the control , so I 'm making the choices . Aeon , if I wanted the control back , I 'd have it by now . And I would steal it again . I 'll never be changed against my will . Don 't you see ? We 've all already changed . The alien has changed us . Our physical strength is as nothing compared to her mental power . She has shown us what we could be . I 'm glad you stopped me from using the ray . You were right . I was wrong . Extraordinary words to hear from the mouth of Trevor Goodchild . Anyway , I 'm glad you 're sending her home . Sending her home ? I was wrong , but now I 'm on the right track . I 'm going with her . I 'll go to her planet and learn all I can , cure what I can ... I 'm ashamed of what I 've done . Ashamed ? How pathetic . You 're running away , Trevor . You 're forgetting what it means to be human . Don 't do it . Don 't go ! - You won 't make it . - But I have made it . - So I see . - No , you don 't see . You need to see . We all need to see . And we will . Come back to the pod . A rescue party is waiting . Sweet dreams . Trevor . Oh , no . Trevor ! Trevor , there 's a bomb . Eject the tube . No ! He 'll be back . I 'll be waiting . I feel your pain . Okay , okay , I don 't ! I don 't understand . Aeon . Why am I not surprised to see you ? - What have they done to you ? - I 'm trying to be like them . They 've taken over . You brought them back . No , no . They were already here . You feel it , don 't you ? - Feel what ? - My thoughts . - Where are you going ? - Read my mind . Don 't do it , Aeon ! Is this what you wanted ? Are you satisfied ? Now I 'm the only one . Out . Get out of my head , you ... Get out ! It 's you or me now . The control ! Do you remember the night you stole this from me ? You weren 't going to let me kill off half the human race , remember ? Trevor , if this is an " I told you so " speech , don 't bother . If I 'd let you do it , the aliens would never have taken over . You don 't get it , do you ? You don 't understand at all ! Sorry , your aliens ... Aeon , there are no aliens . These people you think of as aliens are what we have become . They 're humans . They 're us ! - It 's called evolution . - You 're lying ! Congratulations . You 've just killed off the entire human race . They are us . I am alien . We are all winners ... those who will be left , once I use the ray ... We have already evolved so much ... our actions would be incomprehensible to a human from 1,000 years ago . It 's the evolution revolution . Go forth and multiply .

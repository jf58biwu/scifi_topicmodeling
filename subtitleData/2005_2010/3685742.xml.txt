 My name is jane vasco . I could use you on my team . I work for a secret government agency that hunts neuros . People who can do dangerous things with their minds . On my first assignment ... Something a little weird happened , okay , something really weird . Until i get some answers i 'm getting on with my life , doing my job . Stocking up on aspirin , because let me tell ya , pain 's a bitch ! When you spend a lot of time with the people you work with , you get to know them well , even if you have never been to their homes , you can imagine how they live . When i visited andre , his place was clean , organized . And i guess you can say , manly . Except for the box of captain crunch in his kitchen . He claims it 's for when his niece visits . Sure . Been to mo 's place lots of times , the surroundings fit the woman . Haven 't seen riley 's pad but i can imagine stacks of comic books , tech gear and sci fi memorabilia . As for connor , let 's just say , i plan to wash my hands for a long time with really hot water and industrial soap after i leave . Vasco . Nice hardware . Damn right . Oh , you mean the bike . What 're you doing here ? Got a lead on the kids . Riley 's been trying to get you on the comm all morning . And you volunteered to come by personally . We drew straws . I lost . Briefing 's at 1400 hours . That 's two hours from now . A lot can happen in two hours . You 're being modest . I 'm sure you could get the job done in two minutes . Two minutes . Just enough time for me to torque down these heads . Maybe you shouldn 't be playing with sharp instruments . Just a burn . Coffee maker blew a gasket on me . It 's more organized than i thought it would be . You expected a scattered mess . Something like that . Not me . Works chaotic enough . Gotta come home to Ssomething different . Yeah , i know . Thanks . Maybe you should play with toy boats instead . Hell , that was close . Must 've made contact with the terminals . Must have . In the future it may be a good idea to disengage the gears before you get under the bike . I always do . Almost always . Mcbride . Car 's out front . Chinese tradition puts a lot of stock in names . They believe you can make your destiny by what you call yourself . " Joyful fortune . " whoever chose that name was hoping for not just success , but pleasure in it . I wonder if they got either . Let 's focus . These may be kids , but they 're killers . And until we know which one 's the neuro , they are all deadly . Riley , talk to me . ) Triangulation puts our boys in the loading bay . Can you hear me ? Guys , can you hear me ? Andre , what 's going on ? Chip him ! Chip him ! Which one ? The window isn 't broken ! It 's the one furthest from the window ! Come on ! Okay , guys , i 'm back . Is everythings okay ? Yeah , we 're alright . Let seth know we 're coming in . We 're going to need some looking over . I 'm on , boss . What the hell was that ? Ultra-sonics would be my guess . Only that one kid was the neuro . Yeah , it was more than enough . You okay ? Yeah . My boot 's worse than my ears . Thanks for patching me up , doc . I appreciate it . That 's what i 'm here for . Come to the hospital for better xrays , i 'll set you up with some painkillers . I think , I 'll be fine . Of course you will . That should hold you until the bone heals . Try to stay off it . Not your day , is it ? The burn , the bike , now your foot ... I 'm bucking the odds . Maybe i 'll buy a lottery ticket . You think there could be another explanation ? Yeah . Bad day , crap happens . That 's life . Since you 're so concerned , maybe you 'd be interested in turning my luck around . I think maybe you should be more concerned than i am . You 're still here . Something on your mind . You believe in coincidence ? I believe in getting straight to the point . Connor . There 's a lot i don 't know about him . That 's true . And that 's not a coincidence . You know more about his past than anyone on the team . I know what i need to know . And you know what you need to know . Did you know that he had three " accidents " today . A coffee machine blew up in his face ... His bike almost took his leg off ... And the door . If something or someone from his past has resurfaced ... If all of what 's happened isn 't a coincidence ... Then the whole team could be in jeopardy . Look , i don 't know what 's going on here . I just don 't feel comfortable waiting for the next thing just happenned . So i 'm supposed to act based on your feelings ? No . On yours . You 're not taking this seriously ? I have to , Connor , it 's my job . Tell vasco to stick to what she does best ... Remaing invulnerable to injuries and everyone around her . Sounds like you take it personally . After today we should be drinking , not thinking . So tell me ... What is it you 're trying to avoid thinking about ? A guy can 't just have a drink with a friend ? It 's your timing that concerns me . See , i don 't think it 's a coincidence . Here we go . We made a deal when i brought you aboard . You 'd tell me everything i need to know . I made good on that . As far as you know , you have . I had riley check the specs on that door it 's right up to code , redundant safeties . No way that thing could have been blown unless someone tampered with it . Now you 're sounding like vasco . Too bad there 's not enough of this to make you look like her . Just talk to me . If there 's something , anything in your past ; any unfinished business , whatever it is , i need to know . Even if there was ... What are we talking about here ? I meant , there was nobody in the garage when the trannie slipped into gear . And besides us and the freak boys ' quad , there was no one else at that warehouse . I 've got a closet fulla skeletons , we both know that . But they 're dead skeletons , boss . They aren 't comin ' back to life to haunt my coffee maker . Drink this , you 're making me nervous . I don 't know what we 're supposed to be looking for here . For all i know , jane is making a big deal from nothing . Hello ? Somebody here ? Anybody ? Is anybody here ? You waiting for these ? Oh yeah , right . There 's no gear here for the part of my body that i like to exercise . You might want to reconsider that . Why ? I look out of shape to you ? What 's on your mind , riley ? Oh , maybe staying awake all night , working up a full history profile on connor . Yeah , that sounds like a great time . It wasn 't . Andre said it was your idea . Something about you having a hunch that something from connor 's past might be reaching out to ... Touch him . Oh , yeah . I guess it was . A hunch ? An educated guess . No , a hunch ! With no data to confirm the facts it 's a hunch ! They 've paid off in the past . You telling me you 've never had a hunch ? No , i haven 't ! And i 've never seen a ghost , been abducted by aliens , found the truth of my life in astrology , You know what , I been granted three wishes by a genie ... By the sounds of your " enthusiasm " , my hunch paid off . Yes , maybe but that 's not the point . I think it is . Learn to live with it , ri . By the way , what is your sign ? Easy . Yeah , you love it . My sign ... Barrier precinct tactical response squad . This photo was taken twelve years ago . What the hell 's this all about ? You authorized this ? Connor , five of these men are now dead . Davis monfredo was driving a combine on his father 's farm and got caught in the gears . Sucked him in up to his waist before they got it shut off . Kevin douglas , pinned between a forklift and a loading dock , crushing his pelvis . Gottschalk and rubin , both died in car accidents . Taken separately , maybe accidental . But put them all together ... And we 're looking for is a man who knows how to beat the safeties on an industrial fire door . And on a vintage motocylce . Last one was joey berlin , got mangled by a generator . Last night at bassetts department store . Eleven miles from here . Connor ... Can you make a call on this ? Relax , they 're coming . You know , when you get out of prison , you think " i did it , did my time . " pull enough crap in your life , you never stop doing time . You have any idea what this is about ? I haven 't seen any of those guys in ten years . Did any of these guys do time with you ? Hell , no . They were the pride of the precinct , the dream team , immaculate , untouchable . Untouchable ? Well , someone 's trying to get back in touch with you . - Who 'd have a reason ? - We put away a lot of creeps . You want a list ? Some of those ... Thank you . Some of those guys you put away were wearing blue . I told you , not on this team ! Hey ! Hey , go easy . None of this is easy . Are you sure you 're not painting these guys a brighter shade of white just because you want to ? I know who i am and what i 've done . I don 't need to color reality . I noticed . Here 's the deal , connor . Right now , you 're at risk , and you 're putting the whole team at risk . What do you want I should do ? Crawl into a hole ? Close enough . Until this is over , you lie low , you go underground . And if it takes weeks ? If it takes weeks , i 'll buy you another bottle of reality . Go easy . Wine waits for no man . Have you almost done ? I just have to double check these last couple of quotes and ship it off to my editor . I 'll get that for you . I didn 't know you liked crosswords . Of should i say , " loved crosswords . " i had some time to kill in the laundry room yesterday . You should do laundry more often . There 's about three weeks worth of dirty clothes here . It was a couple of hours . You did that whole stack of crosswords in a couple of hours ? In pen ? Wow , i better watch my back around you . I 'll watch yours . Something i said ? No . Maybe something i did . Those puzzles . No crime in being smart . I guess i 'm a lot smarter than i thought i was . Obviously . You chose me . As i recall , you picked me . Really ? Yeah . Two smart people , huh ? Think that 'll work out ? As long as the tie-breakers go to me . You know , for a girl who likes to come across as a tough guy , you might want to hide your bronte collection . It reveals the romantic in you . You 've been snooping my bookshelves ? I 'm a reporter . Occupational hazard . You going to write my story ? Or just get to know it . And i hope it 's a very long one ... With lots of installments . Timing is everything . This better be extremely important . - Hello ... - Jane , it 's andre . I need you to get over to connor 's . I thought he was ... " Out of town " . Yeah , he 's laying low , but he rembered some letters written from a couple of guys on his squad . They 're a few years old , but they might give us some more personal insight than what riley can bring up on his computer . They 're in a box in his garage . Right now ? Yes , right now , is there a problem ? No , it 's fine . Good , while you 're there , i want you to dig around for anything else that might be , relevant . Liste , none of us are perfect , jane . That 's definitely includes connor , he might be withholding information that could jeopardize us all , especially himself . I 'll take care of it . Good , call me when you 're done . Right . I 've got to go . Will you promise to hold that last thought ? It was more than a thought , but don 't worry , it 's not going to change for quite some time . Nice to meet you too ! This would be a lot easier if you tell me where king is . Who the hell are you ? You are going to find out right now ! I just wanna talk to him ! He was tall , about 6 foot , short hair , silver , with a little bit of black on the sides . Ring any bells ? About a million guys playing the slots in vegas . This wasn 't his first fight . The guy knew what he was doing with a knife . You got those photos ? I ran an aging program on the old photo . These are the surviving members of connor 's team . That 's him ! William hoyt pierce . Senior officer . We lost touch when i went upstate . Look like he 's feeling nostalgic . Riley , current address ? The guy 's law enforcement , he 's always on the move , no fixed address . He 's off the radar completely . You 're saying you can 't find him . I never say never . Maybe we need to let him find us . Connor , we got you in sight . Nothing arriving except one vehicle . There . King ! Pierce was here and never changed position . The truck made no course corrections . Pierce was the intended target the whole time . He wasn 't after you . He was trying to warn you . Or kill me because he thought i was behind it . The truck shows no sign - of mechanical tampering . - And no one behind the wheel . So we 're looking for a guy who can control a five ton truck without touching it . We need to alert the surviving team members . One guy had his legs caught in a combine . Second was crushed from the pelvis down . And the third who was dragged into the generator ... Was that feet first ? - Yes ... - Connor 's near-misses . Either one could have cut his legs off . Connor , can you think of anybody who 'd have any reason to take these guys out from the bottom up ? Beeman . Harry beeman . Fire doors ! System breach ! Lockdown engaged ! Intruders ? I can 't tell . Systems are going crazy ! Assume the worst . Ahh ! Seth , secure positions ! Riley ! release the weapons locker ! It should be open ! - Well it 's not ! - Something 's jamming me . Override 's no go . Don 't waste the ammo . We don 't know what 's coming , and we 've got , what ? - Twenty rounds each ? - Extra mags in the fridge . Riley , the door ! Everybody back ! Everybody back ! Seth ! Close . Thanks . Riley , what 's our status ? Systems are completely down . Check your sidearms . Connor , divide up those extra mags . Chip gun ? Yes . There 's only long range clips in the fridge . All the scopes and rifles are in the weapons locker . Remind me to store more stuff in the fridge . Fire doors came slamming down . Manual override 's jammed . Then we 're sealed in . Someone 's turning our own security against us . Harry . You knew this day was coming . You earned it . This is my station . These are my people . So explain yourself to me . I don 't answer to you ! I don 't answer to anybody ! Not since the day mr . King left me in a building where tons of rubble came down on me . It was a standard perp extraction , harry . No one knew he 'd wired the place with c-4 . No one could have . Except maybe the cowards sent me in first . It could have been any of us . It should have been all of us ! But you 've moved on . Got a new team . A brave captain . But for me , things just stay the same . In this chair , every day . That 's my life . Thinking about what should have been . And what shouldn 't . And then you 're life changed , you developed ' special powers . ' yeah . Funny , huh ? Can 't move my legs but i can move a half-ton truck . And all sorts of other interesting things , like loading dock doors and motorcycle gears without having to lift a finger . Guess somebody up there 's looking out for me . Joe ! You won 't take me out with machines . Machines serve me . He 's gone . Joe ! He 's gone ! Andre ! The light ! Joe , can you hear me ? Seth , the train , if he rolls it ... Joe is down there , we can 't leave him , go help . Nobody hung beeman out to dry , and this was by the books , it was just damn stupid luck that he was first in . And now it 's our damn stupid luck he can use this equipment against us . You want me to apologize to the bastard , I will . But i didn 't put him in that chair , that 's not how it went down . Somehow , i don 't think an apology 's going to work . We 're talking revenge here . The guy 's been stewing for years . It might 've started that way , but i don 't think that 's what it is now . Seth and joe aren 't part of his past . They weren 't on his squad . He knows i could give a crap if he took me out first . He 's enjoying himself . Showing me what he can do to my team before he takes me down . The flashlights too . He 's coming at us again ! Crap . You 're looking okay , joe . I 'm not , but i do what i can . Good work , seth . What the hell is he doing ? Waiting . He 's got the advantage . Riley , what do we have left ? There 's still power to the security grid . But i 'm being blocked out . I 'd say our neuro 's using our own grid to spy on us . That 's how he knows where we are . We 're not going to be able to open the doors until riley can regain control of the system . There 's another way out . Original engineers put in those fire doors , to protect the line . They put in an emergency evacuation shaft , too . Where ? Part of the ventilation tunnel . There 's ladders , manual hatches , it leads right up to the street . Lead on . I 'm staying . I leave here , he 's going to keep on coming . Okay , by letting him kill you , that 'll stop him ? No . Idiot . But i have an idea . I could use your help . Are you asking me for help ? You gonna do it or call a press conference ? Fine , i 'm in . Good . Everybody out of here . I 'll be back with some firepower . I want to hurry . Let 's go ! Right down here . Alright . Your call ... Boss . Down this way . That 's it . Long way up . Sure , you can make it , joe ? I race you . We 'll do it together . Are you kidding me ? Is it locked ? Joe , what the hell is that ? That 's crazy . This stuff 's been disconnected for 15 years . That doesn 't seem to bother beeman . Please tell me we 're not about to be sucked up into that fan . Doesn 't have that kind of draw . You feel that breeze , though ? From the fans . They 're spinning in reverse . They 're not blowing air into this shaft ... They 're sucking it out . We make our way up the tracks . Make it look like we know where we 're going ... Like we 've got a way out . If beeman 's watching us , maybe he 'll come out of hiding to stop us . And you need me for this plan because ... ? I want to keep you close to me , so i keep my eye on you . I didn 't think i could help the others . Maybe they can help themselves but ... You 're the one that matters to me . Probably the only thing that 's mattered to me in a long time . Beeman probably knows how i feel about you . And that puts you in his spotlight . If anything happened to you ... It 'd be worse than hell . How much air do you think we have ? We 'll know when we run out of breath . There 's a manual hatch at the top . If we can get there in time . Riley , let 's check it out . Hustle up . I don 't think , we have much time left . Don 't stop riley , keep going . Come on ! They have to get the hatch open . Andre ! I 'm working on it ! " No one could have seen that coming , " right , connor ? ! Just bad luck you sent her in first . Question ... Can you live with yourself now ? ! Yeah . I can live with myself . Hey , kiddo , you alright ? The only woman i know who gets hit by a train and lives to tell about it . Ooh ! That looks like it hurt . Boss , the fan ! The door ! Try the door ! What ? Open the door ! Clear . Let 's go , come on . Everybody okay ? All in one piece . When the fans stopped , we knew you must have done it , you chipped him ! I stopped him . you don 't worry about that thing starting up and ripping your face off ? Maybe i figure it 's someone else 's turn to have a homicidal neuro on their trail this week . Lightning only strikes once , huh ? Bike 's gotta get fixed . You think on your feet , vasco . I 'll give you that . When a guy starts declaring his undying affection , it wakes you up . Knowing how sensitive and romantic you are ... I knew you were up to something . And being in love with me obviously wasn 't it . Obviously . Beeman was watching us . Figured we 'd give him a show . I was betting on the fact that he hated me enough to take it out on you . Lucky me . It worked . It did at that . You get a lot of that ? Guys ' declaring ' ? I 'm a girl . Occupational hazard . Anything i can do to help ? - You could hand me that torque wrench . - This ? That 's the one . How long you been working on it ? About nine months . Your baby . That 's the thing . Women never appreciate the beauty of a well-built machine . I 'm not so sure about that . You know what they say about judging books by their covers . Maybe it 's the same with people . Some of us work hard to present a cover to the world around us ... Even to the people we 're closest to . The kind of cover that makes people to walk by without ever picking up the book . The pages remain unread and there 's nothing to be learned between the lines . - Hey , you gonna help or watch - Oh , yeah . Hand me the damn ratchet wrench over there ! This ? That will do .

 Homunculus Robert Reinert 's dramatic poem PROLOGUE Artistic direction by Otto Rippert Carl Hoffmann Photography The characters : ... And so , dear colleagues , my friend Hansen 's research to create chemically this artificial human being has failed miserably . Intangible nature has its limits . Life and Death keep their secrets inviolate . No , Professor - shouts Hansen - I still have faith ... and I still do not give up , I will not surrender ! ... The science laboratory of Hansen 's research . Rodin is his trusted aide . A happy event at Ortmann 's house . Not science , but of love : the smile of a baby in its crib . Hansen 's tenacity has paid off . A heartbeat , a cry : Homunculus is born ! Ortmann 's announcement . And that day , his baby suddenly grew sick . Hansen , invited to London for a conference on his ... great discovery , which shook the world , entrusts the baby ... to the wise care of ... Professor Ortmann . Doom ! ... the child of love dies , while the child of science lives ! ... A criminal thought . At night , like a thief ... Ah , woe , woe ! ... The little one is dead ... Ortmann entrusts his secret to his friend , Steffens . Ah , how fleeting my success ! My dream is crumbling With the rapid decomposition of this little life that escapes ! Twenty-five years later . To all the world , Homunculus is the son of the late Professor Ortmann . At school , Homunculus , without faith , studies the teacher Hansen 's lectures . In life ... Men talk of love , but what is love ? Twenty five years ago , this very day , I managed to create a Homunculus . But the little one died almost immediately . His death was perhaps fortunate . Homunculus , outwardly perfect But without love , deprived of all human feeling ... Would have gone through life as a terrible scourge of hatred and destruction ! Me , too , I am like Homunculus , without love , wanting to hate , to destroy ! ... Why am I this way ? ... In the stormy tempest of doubt I have tried to raise you as my son , but you 're not . The secret of your birth is written In a box I gave to my good friend Steffens . The Will will be removed Open only 25 years after my death and not before . Ortmann . I want to know everything , everything , everything ! What a horror ! ... Homunculus , that living monster , it 's me ! ... Oh , how I hate the man that made me - born of their mixtures and stills ! As Hansen . The document reveals ... You , you Homunculus ? ! ... You , the son of my brain ? You are alive ! ... Alive ! ... Let me touch you , my work ! ... I hate you ! Get out ! ... Can you perhaps give me a soul ? Can you make me cry ? Can you help me cry so that I can yell " mama " , " mama ? " Homunculus Part One A stray dog . You , too , poor dog , you walk alone and tramp ? ... But you do not fear me . Exhale your breath on my hand and warm it . Will you be my companion and friend ? Illiana , the daughter of the Prince of Desagra ( displeasure ) . What are you , a pilgrim ? Are you downcast ? ... Is there anything I can do for you ? Not for me but for my poor dog . If you feed him , I will be grateful . The Prince , paralytic for many years ... They told me about a strange figure that comes Outside the gates of the Sacred City . Is it Homunculus , of whom everyone in the world Speaks about in horror of his mercilessness . Through valleys and over mountains , Rodin continues to search without finding traces of Homunculus . Unconsolable , the doctors can do nothing to save her prince . My father is dying . I have spoken with healing words before ... I will cure him ... take me to him ... Up ! I command you ! His will , created by science , is able to perform the miracle . You saved my life . Ask of me what you like . I can make you rich and happy . That does not mean anything . I reach out hoping that one day you will not attack me ... Farewell ... End of Part One Homunculus Part Two He holds the infernal book . He draws his superhuman strength from those old pages . Love sings in vain in the heart of Illiana . I received word from the prince . He wants to talk to you . The people accuse you of witchcraft . I want to know who you are . Explain ! What do you care who I am ? Here I do good things . What more do you want ? It is Homunculus ! It is Homunculus ! Lee ! Lee ! Look more closely , look ! ... Thieves ! ... My book ! ... Give me back my book ! ... Death to Homunculus ... Death ! One more step and I will throw the book over the cliff ! Death to Homunculus - Kill him ! Death to the man who spreads terror in the world ! Illiana 's heart . Come ... I will save you ! Among the ruins of the old Moorish castle . Are you here , Rodin ? ... What do you want ? ... Why are you looking for me ? Are you also my enemy ? I seek you partly because I love you , partly because I admire your work ! We have been discovered ! Flee ! Kill him ! Kill him ! What do you want , you murderers ? Poor beast , you have paid for your attachment to me with your life . You will be forever in my memory ... Rodin is with him , foretelling a dark and tragic fate . Only one drop of this liquid can destroy a thousand lives together ! Terrible flame , you 're mine ! ... You must obey me ! ... That day ... This man 's look has driven a stake in my soul like a cold knife . They talk about love ! ... Ah , I would sacrifice everything , even my revenge For a single word , I would feel love ! ... Ask for grace and mercy for the alms of that word that I do not know . You flee from me , but I wait ! I have decided , come ! ... My gaze seeks you out , come ! ... Your love is for me a supreme attempt at renewal ! His mouth is as cold as death - it knows no kiss . Many days later . You were away from home and your Enrico was killed ! Leave this man , as he has become fatal to us . We are old and infirm . Autumn leaves drop , just like hearts . Your mother has died of grief . I am left alone in the old house . I 'm cursed ! ... Damned ! Cry ! ... Is this the pain that makes people mourn ? ... She loves me because she knows who I am . I cannot afford to lose her . I want to be loved for who I am ! The time has come for you to know it all . The crib where I was born was a chemical laboratory . I owe my life to the whim of a scientist . The product was horrendous - their mixtures and stills . I am Homunculus ! You have broken the spell . Leave me . You frighten me . Hate me , for I am indestructible , eternal ! Only you are mine ! Ah , my father , I am your daughter , look at me ... I returned to mourn you , asking for forgiveness ! Flower ! Neither you nor I have born men . Who would dare to curse you for it ? You 've torn from me every flicker of hope ! ... And I have lost everything for you ! Back in the dark .

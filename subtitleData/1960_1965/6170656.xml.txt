Well , there must be something very special . DO NOT ENTER DO NOT BOTHER PROJECTS XL Well , it 's over . Well within . Within . My own time machine . Modesty aside , it is magnificent ! Now the question is , does it work ? Now , let me see . What can I use to test it ? Ora , claro ! Robert ! Now , let 's Robert . It will not hurt anything . In fact you should feel honored . I will transport you back in time . Entre na máquina do tempo , Robert . Enter the time machine . Enter the time machine . Close the door . Now , let 's see . How much will I send him back ? Well ...

Well , we have much left alone since we returned from patrol . It 's time to see what he 's doing . I 'll get the car . Here 's the key to my workshop . No one should go until I 'm ready to show my new invention . I understand ? Already ready ? Already I finished . Tell me Professor , I keep secret . What is it ? You 'll know soon when show for everyone , in front of the Commissioner of Patents . He arrives tomorrow , right ? Yes . Come tonight Saturn . Especially to see her in the invention . He will not miss the trip . Now , do not forget . No one , I say , no one can enter the workshop . - Understand ? - Okay , Professor . Well , now I need some sleep . Vamos , Robert . Oh ... I 'm really tired ... But Sr , Prof. He said that no one can enter until tomorrow . Give me the key , Lieutenant . This is an order . It 's all right , Lieutenant . Do not worry , Lieutenant . After we explained to him . The key , Lieutenant , if you please ! Ok , Comandante . I do not know what the teacher will say . Do not touch ... Leave alone ... New invention ... No one ... No one can touch ... Play ... So that 's the whole mystery of why ? How about that , Steve ? Well , let 's take a look inside . Let 's do this . Hmm , seems like an artificial gravity test . I am but never seen one like this before . Well , if it was Matt who did , this is not surprising . See , an old pot . It 's still warm . Do not tell me after all , Matt is doing a new coffee machine ? Waste of public money . Oh , heavens , look Zoonie . I need to stop it . Matt will be furious . By the gods , do not let it ruin anything . Zoonie , Zoonie , a porta . Abra a porta . Venus , you can not make him understand ? - Not so get out of here . - Apparently not . I think we 're stuck here until morning . That stupid Lazoon . It only causes problems here ... What 's going on ? We are floating in space . And we are without our jets . Steve , Steve , I can not see it . We are invisible . And my clothes , they are different . Commander Zero , are you there ? What the hell is going on ? My uniform is gone . Hey , I 'm wearing something different . I feel like I 'm disappearing . Disappearing completely . Professor ! Professor , levante ! What 's going on ? Professor , Steve , Venus e o Comandante Zero they went to his workshop . Oh , my , I 'm sorry teacher . See , I gave the key to them . Oh no ! Do not tell me . Well , it 's hard to believe , but see , they ... they simply disappeared . No use crying , Zoonie . Things are bad enough as well . This is your fault , Lieutenant . You had no right to let anyone , With the same or Steve . Zero , get the key of the workshop . I 'm afraid this is above patent question . Gee , Professor , I was just following orders . As I said . Sim , Ok , Tenente . Are you sure that all were lost in the time machine ? Sim , positivo . To the old teapot disappeared . Join other thefts , these thieves . You can bring them back , Professor ? Can ? Well , I will give all I can . I brought Robert back . But I do not know exactly when they were on time . This crazy Lazoon was playing with the controls . Hey , this is a long overdue town . A bank . Bar . No people , I would say . NEED UP SHERIFF It seems that I have come to the right place . Sheriff Zodiac . Well , with all this luck you have , Frenchie , I will . You and me . Ha , what dual ! Now listen , Zero . It is a perfect setting . The bank will be open , just waiting to be stolen . And they even have a sheriff . It 's just that old fool , delegate Dodgen . Just imagine , a city without a sheriff . SHERIFF ZODIAC Well , we are very glad to be here , Sheriff . Right , Doc ? Yes sir . And we really hope to stay longer the other sheriffs . Well , if someone hit me , I can tell you that will fix me , huh , Doc ? That 's where you 're wrong , Sheriff . See , I 'm not a doctor of medicine . It is not ? I mean , he is not ? But you are something of a doctor , Doc ? I never knew . Doctor of Literature . But people here do not have much time to literature . Not read . So take care of their money in the bank next door . Best Western bank . And he never broke so far . No one here , only our old four legs there . Relax , Sheriff . There are many problems here . It 's been quiet for years and years . But what about those names on the door ? Simply deadly boredom . How about playing the old bronze box , Deleg . Dodgen ? - That , good idea . - I 'll play my last song . Eu a chamei " Cactus Kate da California , lugar das flores most beautiful I 've ever seen . " It is , in fact there is only one person who could open the vault of my bank . - And that person is Lil Frenchie . - A woman ? It is the smartest thug ever . And beautiful too . Although almost no one has seen . This Frenchie Lil works alone ? I used to work . But I heard that now works with a hit man named Zero . Zero ? That 's weird . It seems that I know that name . Yeah , I heard that this girl is dynamite . My bank ! Come on boys , come on ! Books ! Okay , get out with the hand up . - Zero ! - Zero ? I 'm not a doctor , he can see the will be off for a long time . That book knocked him out . It was a book of heavy reading ... Okay , drop your weapon , Sheriff . Lil Frenchie ! Lil Frenchie ? Where 's the money , Doc ? I said to drop the weapon , Sheriff . She looks like someone I knew . Or not ? Yes , the name is Lil Frenchie . One more step and I fill you lead , Sheriff Zodiac . When I left , the machine was right for 1875 . Now watch this . Now the question is , It has been changed before or after they enter the machine ? If only this miserable Lazoon could tell us . You need to bring them back , Professor . You need ! I 'm doing my best . But remember , a misstep and I can lose them in time forever . Now , I believe that not budge in the controls . Now , let me see . 1875 . I can not understand it . I 'm sure you already have seen before . But it was different somehow . Say it again and I 'll shoot you . And that would be a shame , because I kind of like you , Zodiac . And there is enough to carry . But Lil Frenchie never lost a deal . Oh , my head . Everything is ready , I think . Needs work . Really need work . Goodbye , Zodiac . I hope we meet again . Very quickly . Look ! Goodbye , Zodiac . Adeus , linda Frenchie Lil ! Well , all the dirty crooked deals , This Zero is a true master . - How do we get out of here , Sheriff ? - That 's what I was wondering . I will increase the power . Well Sheriff , any idea how to get out of here ? I wanted to know , friends . Just I wanted to know . No ! Not again ! I can not stand it . Oh well ... we are doomed . Well I could smoke now . But my pipe , oh , my pipe , I left him on the bench . Oh , my ! I 'm glad to see you back , sir ! And you too , Commander . Where is Venus ? She was with us . This is like a nightmare , but I remember that it was achieved by zero . By me ? I did what ? I 'm afraid so , Commander But what happened to her ? She was unconscious , she could not return . - Try to increase the power . - This would destroy the machine . We would have more chances with this . She can not travel back in time in its present state . But you need to bring it back . It will not take much more . It will explode ! Increase power . This is it , Steve . That 's ... that 's what I feared . Welcome ! Well , is this , gentlemen . Thank goodness you 're okay . But we break Matic machine . You back safely and talking . It 's all that matters , Venus , Two masters of the Patent Office to see a máquina do Professor . Since we were not previously presented ? Some time ago . Yes sir . A long time ago ...

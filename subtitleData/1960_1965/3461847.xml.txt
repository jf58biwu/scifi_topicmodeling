 THE PLANET OF STORMS Attention ! Moscow calling ! Moscow calling ! All radio stations of the Soviet Union broadcasting a TASS announcement . Three astro-ships of a Soviet space expedition " Sirius . " " Vega " and " Capella " having travelled over 200 million kilometres are approaching Venus . The cosmonauts feel fine . They have come so far and die near Venus ... We are still powerless against big meteorites . I can hardly believe it . I just talked to them . Earth calling ! " Sirius ! " " Vega ! " We are shocked at " Capella ´ s " fate . We have faith in your courage . Enter the sputnik orbit . Investigate conditions on Venus . " Arcturus " will be ready to take off next week . It will journey for months . Waiting is torture . But you know the plan . One ship remains in orbit with fuel . Two land , for safety . No one can land until " Arcturus " arrives . Ships can ´ t land what about people ? One alternative is for " Vega ´ s " glider to land ... with Kern ´ s automat . Let me land in the glider . The glider doesn ´ t return . I know . I`ll work and wait for " Arcturus " . I ´ ll , accomplish more than a hunk of steel . Someone ´ s got to see Venus with his own eyes . What if something happens to you ? I won ´ t yell for help . I ´ ll put that in writing . My life is my own . Mr. Kenrl We have a problem . Half a minute ! I can ´ t believe they ´ re gone . They were lucky . Instantaneous death . Alyosha wants to land in a glider . Why should " Vega ´ s " glider be used by someone from " Sirio " ? We understand each other . What ´ s it all about ? Nothing special ... Better to die usefully than wait for a meteorite to hit you or radiation disease to get you . - Earth won ´ t permit a landing . - It must . Let ´ s figure it out . Without considering the danger . Risk is standard behaviour in space . Figure it out with the help of your invention . My firm has been waiting for a real work . 7 , 12 , 9 , Hello , John ! Wake up ! Yes , sir . Dear John , give us the best plan for landing with return with only " Vega " and " Sirio " present . There are seven of us now , including you . Ignore the danger factor . " Vega " remains in orbit with one man . " Vega ´ s " glider lands three . " Sirio " lands three , making six in all . " Sirio " takes five back The sixth remains on Venus . - Who remains ? - I do , sir being dead and the havest . Mathematics is pitiless . A rotten plan . A good plan , but dangerous . Who remains in orbit ? According to that plan I ´ m the only one . No one else can process the information and transmit it to Earth . I ´ d always hoped for something different . I worked so hard for so many years . Sputnik , then the Moon You Know ! I hoped we ´ d be together . What do you suggest ? I don ´ t know . The international association insists on the Robot . It will a test for a whole trend in cosmonautics . And I have to see Venus . Don ´ t I have to ? Another world . We ´ ve sent automats there so many times in recent years . We ´ ve studied the atmosphere , discovered oceans and continents measured the temperature ... But the automats don ´ t tell us about the main thing . Is there life there ? Now man come himself to find out . Get ready drop a beacon . Surface pressure 2 and 3 . Cloud altitude 15 . Clouds of ashes above the coast . Another carbondioxide centre . A red glow can be seen through the clouds . Thousands of new facts and nothing about the main thing - who lives there . Nothing living has yet appeared . Perhaps the red glow is a lighted city . It ´ s a dead planet . Intelligence has already destroyed itself . Who is right ? Automats can never replace man . " Sirius ! " " Vershininh ! " I don ´ t see a landing strip for " Sirio " . Shall we change the place ? No , the assignment is to land here . I have a suggestion . We don ´ t need " Arcturus " From one kilometre altitude the glider will find you a landing strip . - What if it doesn ´ t ? - They ´ ll put up statues to us . Who ´ ll be the glider crew ? Kern. the Robot , myself . Masha remains in orbit . We ´ ll leave the Robot on Venus . - You ´ ve got it all figured out ! - Long ago . I wish I were with them . It ´ s reckless ! Prepare a well-substantiated report to headquarters . Perhaps we ´ ll get permission . - Ready ? - Yes . GO ! I envy you , Shckerba ... You too , Allan Kern ... I understand you captain Good luck , friends ! They ´ re approaching . Storm clouds ... Lightning . We ´ re turning the controls over to John . A sheer cliff ahead . I ´ m climbing Clouds on the ground . We ´ re using the locator . It ´ s bad so far . Here ´ s a flat strip in a hollow . Hard ground ... Good for landing We ´ re dropping the beacon . Land in square 73 We ´ re being carried away There ´ s water below ... We ´ ll land in a swamp . Projecting rocks . Chandes of destruction 90 % I ´ m landing . Calm down , Masha . They ´ ve landed . We got an image on the screen . We ´ ll contact them at the next turn . Shcherba ! Hello ! Kern ! ¡ Shcherba ! ¡ Kern ! ... ¡ Hola ! It looks bad . Get ready . We ´ ll land now . It ´ s calmer at night . Square 73 Masha , we ´ re going to land Masha , we ´ re going to land You ´ re remaining all alone in space . Masha , dear . Watch us with the locator . You know what to do . I know ... If we lose our lives , keep yourself in hand . I understand ! May I cut the connection now ? You may , my dear ... It ´ s hardest for the one who ´ s alone . Earth ! Flight headquarters permits ... ... you to return at any time . People are what counts . We wish you luck . The whole country is with you . Earth ! Headquarters ! We ´ re landing as planned . Landing square 73 chosen by glider . We assure the Soviet government , Party and people that we ´ ll do all we can to justify their trust in us . If anything goes wrong , help Masha . She ´ s alone . Ilya , it ´ s time . I ´ m removing the aerial . Switching on the automat . Square 73 . Direct course by beacon . So this is Venus ! Square 73 . What a strong downward pull ! Not used to it . Hand land ! Our scouts chose well . We ´ re standing ! Feels like the Earth . I ´ m lifting the shades . Give us some light , Roman . A dense fog . Let ´ s look around with a locator . There ´ s a cliff 200 metres away and some sort of protuberance here ... I ´ ll switch on the outside microphones . Hear that ? What can it be ? Let ´ s not lose time . Use the infra-red viewer and locators . Then we ´ ll transmit to Earth . Do everything according to first plan . When Masha emerges on the horizon ... ... inform her we ´ ve landed . Oh , I ´ ll boast ! We ´ ll boast when we ´ ve rescued the others . Do we start at dawn ? Yes , at 6 a.m. I ´ m standing ! May I walk a few steps ? Careful , feel your way . An ordinary stone ... ordinary water ... I can hardly believe it . Alyosha , turn back . - Masha found the glider . - Are they alive ? She located tow metal objects . One is moving ... Robot , probably - No word ? - The radio may have broken . - Alive ? - Alive ! The space suit ´ s whole . I ´ ll photograph it . There ´ s life here . That ´ s the important thing . You ´ re in too much of a hurry . We ´ re just in time . - How ´ d you find out ? - We heard a shouts . - So did I - Strange ! Anything ´ s possible on Venus . What else did Masha say ? I was so worried about you all . I ´ m so happy . I sang songs and then I flew about the cabin . I took off my magnetized shoes and flew . We ´ d like details . Sorry , I lost my head . They ´ re in the square beyond the red glow That ´ s 32 km away from you across the gulf . Get the cross country car ready . That ´ s a long distance for it . What do you suggest ? Not to land on Venus in gliders . Are they alive ? Couldn ´ t the Robot have begun to move by itself ? I understand you . It could not have . It wasn ´ t assembled . They assembled it there . Stop ! Imps of the devil ! Hol on another minute . That was some blow , John . Course 110 . Base , yourselves on the cliff . Stretch a cable across . Yes , sir . Ordinary men cannot conquer these wild planets . Steel men are better suited . A small tank would be more practical . A man is more attractive . You go first . I ´ ll help . - Shall we stop ? - Yes , let ´ s look around . There ´ s another one ! Looks like a brontosaurus I ´ ll get a blood sample Careful ! And measure his temperature . He ´ s only just realized . What did Masha say ? The Robot is moving towards us , but slowly . Don ´ t hurry . There ´ s oxygen for only 24 hours . They must be looking for us . Coming this way . Through this hell ? No ! People are natural cowards and egoists . People are natural friends ! We ´ ve caught malaria . Infection has got in . We ´ ve torn our suits badly . Let ´ s take some quinocillin . We ´ ve no time to lie down afterwards as prescribed . It will pass . Come on . How far is it to the other shore ? 10 km , across the gulf , 70 around it . - Listen . - Let ´ s sit down . The same voice . A squid of some sort . There are plenty of vermin around . - It ´ s a human being . - A woman , perhaps ? You ´ d better recall Darwin ! How can Man appear in the dinosaur period ? - We ´ re here . - We flew here . Alyosha ´ s right . Man is a space flier . There you go again . Darwin ´ s theory applies to . Mans evolution and pot to his distribution among the planets . That ´ s in Tsiolkovsky ´ s field . I wonder why they keep you in the Academy of Sciences . We ´ re the first arrivals from Earth But there may have been others before us . There ´ s too much water from above . My mechanism is in danger . I need shelter . All right , John , find a cave . I can ´ t stand it any more ! Take yourself in hand ! We can ´ t stop here . We ´ ll be washed away . Hold on . Just a little longer ... Hey , John ! I ´ m in a cave . Lighting 3.2 Luxe . You ´ re a fine mathematician . I feel I ´ m losing my mind . By mathematical laws there will be a world government ... A world government ... World advantage ... World science ... No , Masha , they won ´ t miss us . " Sirio " ... You can reach " Sirio " by car in 37.2 minutes over a concrete road . Bad news from Masha . The Robot ´ s disappeared . Look for them . Maybe you ´ ll hear their helmet phones . I got them . It ´ s the Robot . He ´ s talking nonsense . Listen ! ... the coast of building a road to " Sirio " at Smith prices will be 57 million dollars . The machine is obviously not controlled by anyone . Listen you , Iron John ... The devil ´ s doll doesn ´ t answer . The Robot reacts only if polietely addressed . The egg head ! Dear John , please reply to us . Audibility 46,5 % . Where are your masters ? No masters . Slaveholding is forbidden by the Constitution . I am a free , thinking machine . Describe your companions position . Horizontal position . - Where are you ? - Beneath a stone archway . They ´ re in a cave . That ´ s why Masha couldn ´ t locate them . Dear John , what are your companions talking about ? About Masha , about the world government in witch I ´ ll be Prime Minister . - They ´ re delirious . - Malaria . Something must be done at once . John , take quinocillin from the kit ... Quinocillin - tube No.2 9 : 15 . Transmitted all data ... ... collected by " Sirio " to Earth . 1 : 30 . Passed over car . They were entering the sea . Something is flying towards us on the right . Changing form , rather solid . Looks like a pterodactylus . Pull down your helmets ! It ´ s dangerous . - Did you get a photograph ? - Yes . Then fire the gun . The mechanism ´ s jammed . A flying animal is attacking . A heavy blow . Transmit to Earth . What happened ? Transmit what ? - Ready ? - Ready . They ´ ve disappeared . This car ´ s not meant for underwater . It ´ s the end for them . If their space suits are whole they ´ ll get out . What if they ´ re hurt ? But if I land we won ´ t be able to return to Earth . Still , I must land . I can land at the next turn . In an hour ´ s time . A whole hour to wait ! I must think ir out . The Earth ... Millions of people worked making a pyramid to sky of their work . They placed us on the summit , trusted us . Now everything depends on me alone . And I don ´ t know what to do . The instructions forbid withdrawal form orbit . If I land , return to Earth becomes impossible . But why save fuel if the men are dying ? The instructions could not foresee everything . My heart tells me they need me more . I must inform Earth . How hard it is to speak calmly . Let them listen to my last recording . The instrucions couldn ´ t foresee everything ... My heart tells me they need me more ... Hello ! " Vega " ! Masha Ivanova ! Masha Ivanova ! Earth is with you . Take yourself in hand ! Do not withdraw from orbit . All will be lost ! Have courage ! Earth asks you . Your Earth ! My Earth ! Wait for them in orbit , or all will be lost . What shall I do ? My time is nearly up . I must decide . I cannot ! It was easier to sink the car than to drag it . What resistance ! Let ´ s rest for a little while . Interesting boulders . I ´ ll take a look . Very much like ours . Conditions resemble ours . Surely , nature could not have made such an even row of cliffs . What if it is a sunken city ? Gave me a fright ! An entrance ? Interesting ! Hope the owners are out . What a strange triangular stone ! I ´ ll take ir along . Look at this ! - What is it ? - A Petrified dragon . Perhaps it ´ s made of stone ? Made ? What are you saying ? An eye ! It ´ s ruby ! Put in by a rational being ! Hand me the buoy Volcanic pourus iron is oxidizing and stealing oxygen from the air . Man can change that Want to win a Noble Prize ? One can work for mankind without prizes . Ready , sir . Give us our favourite song The dragon with the ruby eye us nade crudely by a savage , perhaps . But savages couldn ´ t have flown to Venus . Why not . Borbrov flew here . Savages couldn ´ t have flown here . ... but they could have appeared on the spot . Suppose civilized beings had flown here and remained for some unknown reason and lost contact with their own planet . In an alien atmosphere and conditions they would perish . Some would survive but go wild in the brutal fight for survival and adjustment to local conditions . No time for culture in that case . Only the strong would survive . And savages would appear among the dinosaurs ... before the local apes appeared and the future master of the planet began to evolve . Sounds like a warning . We ´ re near the red glow . - Is the gun in order ? - Yes . It ´ s all very strange . A buried city ... The ruby . That voice ... Who could have flown here ? Inhabitants of another planetary system , perhaps ? Martians ? On mars every drop of moisture is a problem . Here there is water everywhere . Maybe they tried to resettle but failed and went wild and are advancing to civilization for the second time . Perhaps Martians once came to Earth and we modern people ... We can go ! I will find her ! It ´ s getting dark early . No wonder . There ´ s a cloud of ashes over us . A volcanic eruption ! So that ´ s the glow ! Your lighted " city " ! Rather inconvenient . But we can get samples of lava and ashes . - Is the spectroscope in order ? - Yes We must look an elevation away from here . A pity to leave this magnificent spectacle The lava is encircling us . - Did you get a spectrum ? - Yes . From the crater edge ? No , it was too late . Take us across the river of flame . Audibility is improving . What ´ s he got there ? I am giving our location as demanded . The distance is two miles . Why , it ´ s our men . And you didn ´ t believe me . Your machine is splendid . At last you admit it . The heat has reached 500 degress . Further movment with a load endangers my mechanism . Turn off the self protection . Open the door , panel 5 . Break the wire ! I don ´ t know which . I can ´ t see from here . I ´ m compelled to get rid of the load . Damned fool ! He ´ ll throw them into the lava ! So what ´ s more suitable steel or flesh and blood ? Both are needed evidently . That ´ s better . How ´ s the radio ? - Where ´ s Masha ? - Passing the zenith . No sound from the radio . Why are they numbered ? We hadn ´ t named them yet . - Daughters ? - Sons ! A complete crew ! So you think rational beings visited the Earth in the past ? There is no evidence of it Many of history ´ s mysteries could be evidence . The Stone . Age drawing on a cliff in Sahara . That ´ s right . It shows a man wearing something like a space suit . And the ancient column in India . The iron it is made of was made by a method unknown on Earth . And the secret of Atlantis . And the extraordinary knowledge of ancient astronomers . None of that is evidence . There is evidence in legends . The descent of the goods from heaven , for instance . How would a savage here draw us ? Like saints with halos and say that a god had descended from the sky And there ´ s your text for local legends . With illustractions ! Space flights are and inevitable stage of development of life everywhere . Worlds are not isolated . the migration of life in space as natural as ... seed swept by the wind on Earth . And branches of a single ... tribe of living beings are developing in the solar system . The solar tribe ... Then rational beings must be related Ah , to see her . What is she like ? Everything would become clear Your squid is happy you are unharmed She is good and beautiful Tomorrow we ´ ll try to catch her . If she ´ s a Martian gone wild , where are the others ? In some out of the way plane on Earth you wouldn ´ t meet anyone in two days . And the telephone hasn ´ t been invented here yet . We ´ ve carried out our programme . All this data ! The stones go to the geologist . Let ´ s go to the radio . Vershinin , hurry . A recording of Mashas ´ s transmission . Perhaps " Sirio " will receive this transmission . The instructions requiere that I remain in orbit that I wait in idleness while my friends may be in mortal danger . I ´ m violating the instructions . I am landing on Venus . I shall switch on the engine in one minute . - How could she ? - She didn ´ t think . A Robot can think , not a woman . May God forgive me ! - She ´ s not in the sky . - She must be . Hello ! " Vega " ! " Vega " could have crashed or sunk . We ´ d better inform Earth . Our only contact with Earth was via " Vega " . suggest that Shcherba , Kern and Alyosha ... stay here for the time being . Roman and I will go into orbit find " Vega " and give you the coordinates trasmit our findings to Earth and summon " Arcturús " . Unload the camping gear . We ´ ve got to lighten " Sirio " anyway . An earthquake ! The rocket has subsided . The bluff is going under . A mountain lake has broken through . Look , a fissure ! If " Sirio " collaspses we ´ re finished . Prepare for take off quickly . Maybe we ´ ll make it . When was Masha ´ s last transmission recorded ? At 7 : 20 . The locator recorded the " Vega " passing after that . She has not landed ! Masha , what happened ? I realized I was making a mistake . I switched off the engine but the orbit has changed . Then I located you at the red glow I watched , but you didn ´ t answer . Now they needn ´ t stay behind . Right . Give us the new orbit . All aboard ! Ivan , are you alive ? Alyosha , switch on the meteorological station . Hurry , Alyosha ! Ilya Scherba . Wait ! We can ´ t leave . Look ! They ´ re like us ! They resemble us ! Wait ! Where are you dragging me ? " Planet of Storms " . till we meet again . " Our ships will return to you " . " For we are sons of the Earth " . THE END

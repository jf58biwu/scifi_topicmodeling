Each member planet Scientific Organization of the Planets , contributed to this year 's findings . Planets hitherto unknown by the people of the universe , will be revealed in all its magnificence and splendor , the miracle of the new ultrascópio . This new probe can dive ... Really , you lazy Lazoon , this is no time to sleep . TV always makes you sleep . For some programs , I can not blame him . I do not agree . I think the programs are of amazing quality . You can not be serious , Venus . All these canned Mars . Just because you like these broadcasts endless interplanetary games , Oh , stop arguing , you two . They will show the observatory at any time . ... And now the moment we were waiting , Direct IAC Space Observatory , and the man in charge of the entire program , Professor Matthew Matic . Cats suffering from space ! Not a failure ! No , no , see . Commander , Steve , image , the picture is coming . How are you guys ? Silence , Zoonie . This is , er ... Teacher Matic the Space Observatory Number 1 . With me is Dr. Stamp . the well-known expert in the observatory 's equipment . The important things to look at are shown this ... er screen . Is it we should see the first images of this new ultrascópio should capture . Er ... that 's all . And now , to work . All right , Dr Stamp ? All right , Teacher , I think Matic and telegenic , do not you , Steve ? He would succeed in show " Sunday Night Spectacular " Saturn . Please be quiet , sir . See Stamp , caught something . - It can not be ! - But it is . The perfect planet , Nutopia . Never before seen by someone of our universe . Let 's look more closely . Shall we ? Of course . The ultrascópio still have power reserves . E er ... what they are seeing , my friends , is the first view of the planet considered most beautiful of any universe . Nutopia ! - This is wonderful ! - It is . It really is beautiful . It is . Too good to be true . The alarm . Who dares to look for the perfect planet Nutopia ? Ligue ultrascópio Oh , perfect . Whoever it is , It must be destroyed . See a ultrascópio , Sweeping the heavens , like ours . Earthlings ! Spying on us from a space sphere . It should not be permitted to return them to Earth to divulge our secrets . Nutopia and its secrets must remain unknown to the rest of the Universe . Design the protective radius . Venus , Commander , something went wrong up there . OK , let 's go . Come , Venus , We regret the temporary loss of contact with the Centre , by circumstances beyond our control . We hope to continue our programming soon . Meanwhile , we 'll show a movie . It might be a momentary loss of contact , Steve . No , that was not a casual loss . Matt and Dr Stamp are in trouble . We have to go help them . Is fast . Prepare-se para a briga , Comandante . Take your time , Steve or never come to Space City . Terran spies . They are desacordados . We should leave them well or bring them here ? Bring them here and destroy them . And any knowledge they have of Nutopia Turn the travel transmitter . All systems ok ! All tests ok ! Take your time , Steve . We set the controls for the return trip ? A trip back to four . Very convenient , be able to travel through space without being seen . Of course , the people of Earth will attempt a rescue . but when they arrive , we 'll be back to Nutopia with our prisoners . Nobody who see Nutopia can survive . So that 's the spy machine on Earth . Mmm . Very primitive . But it is a threat to our privacy , yet Inside it is not much also . Very primitive . - A quiet trip . - Very quiet . Now the back . With earthlings . How are you doing with our course , Venus ? According to my calculations , our course is 1-8-6-0 Red . Robert , going 1-8-6-0 Red . 1-8-6-0 Red course . If we could only go faster . Okay , Venus . Matt would not have sailed better . Thank you , Steve . Stop at fluctuation . I 'll go with Robert while you take a look around . When you put the Earth intruders in the destructor ? No time certain , Perfects . Let me watch them before . We got invaluable information the future of these specimens . For too long we let these specimens to observe . as helpless space fish . Let 's connect the audio and listen to them for a moment . Now , do not worry Stamp . Steve will be here soon . I 'm sure . I admire your optimism . As fast as sumimos in the air , Steve will be on the way to Space Observatory to investigate . Mmm ... Very interesting . It seems to have other species to catch . Logo . Mas que chance tem Steve Zodiac against the advanced knowledge of Nutopianos ? Well , I ... I do not know , but Steve took us from other trouble before . This time I think Zodiac found a competitor to its height . Stay close and keep calm , Venus . We do not know what 's going on inside Space Observatory . Ok , Steve . No sign of anything or anyone . Let 's look inside . Steve is falling straight into the trap ! I send the shock of lightning ? No . Let 's play with them a little more . They just disappeared in space . No . They have not disappeared . Not yet , Steve Zodiac . His companions , Earth creatures are safe . For now . And who , may I ask , are you ? I am Privator , guardian of Nutopia . What want from us ? You see , Steve Zodiac . Look there . That box . It seems some kind of teletransmissor . So that brought us here . There you can see , Zodiac , our two specimens I look forward to join them soon . What harm done to you ? What harm any of us did to you ? You dared to look at the Forbidden Planet . Our planet , Nutopia . He holds many secrets , Secrets we keep for many years light . Our planet is perfect and we must keep its perfection . Fast , Venus , take a leap in Fireball . Send a message to the Com . Zero . I will keep you talking .

The secret of eternal life . You would want to share with us . I would not go beyond there , Earth woman . Now as we leave here , Professor ? Welcome to Nutopia , Colonel Zodiac , and if I may say , to its beautiful Terran . Cel Zodiac can go into the tank with others Earth specimens . And the Earth woman ? - I have other plans for her . - If you touch a finger on her ... You will do what ? I do not think that is in a position to do anything , Cel Zodiac . Do not worry . We will treat it with the utmost respect . DANGER DESTROYER OF CONTROL One false move of Zodiac and we will destroy the Terran with the destroyer . - That 's it . - But you did not want ? Oh , but of course . She 's just a woman . Do not tell me you 're really attracted to her ? No of course not . Never forget Perfectos , it was a woman who almost He destroyed our planet . That 's why we have to get rid of the females of other species . so we could enjoy the privilege of eternal life in a perfect world . Do not remind me . I hope not . I will rest now . Continue watching . I will come to replace it in a few hours . - Zodiac Some news ? - Nothing , Mr. You and I will take a look at Space Observatory , Lieutenant . Sim , Sr. Terran ! Terran ! Do not be afraid , Terran . I just want to help her . Help me ? Yes . Help her . I will find a way to escape his Earthman . Se o quê ? If you stay here as my eternal companion . Never !

We have not much time . - Both died . Only desacordados , Prof. I replaced the capsules mortals stunning . See . Will be well soon , so let 's go . See the Space Observatory . E o Fireball . The controls must be adjusted to send us for the Observatory . There you go . No sign of them . If only this robot could speak . Stop at free float . Stop in free float . I wonder if I should have turned off the machine before we left . It 's too late now , Matt . If only we knew where Steve was . - What ? - Cats spatial jumpers ! Instant trip . A courtesy Travel Nutopiana machine . Here . See ? We still have a picture of it . I Wish I had taken the time to learn more about it . Ei , Steve ! This smoke is coming from the base of the travel machine . I wonder if I should take off those controls . The people of Earth escaped . They must have used the travel machine . Privator fast . They have not turned off the controls . As I thought ... I should have turned off those controls . Translation - Neverlost

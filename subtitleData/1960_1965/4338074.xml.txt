 Not a very good fit . One must be thankful for small favors , mustn 't one ? Where are they ? They should have been here a half hour ago . They 'll be here . They 're probably making very sure that no one is following them . Something might have gone wrong . Perhaps we should start out on our own . No . I have made it repeatedly clear ... that I will put myself into the hands of no one but Admiral Nelson himself . There is absolutely no one else I will trust . Okay , Mr. Koslow . You 're much too valuable to lose now . Not me . It 's the secrets I have stored here that are valuable . Dearest Anna , so much worry on such a little face . The worst is over . Soon we 'll be safely on our way to the United States . - Come . A little smile . [ Chuckles ] - [ Knocking ] I 'm Nelson . This is Captain Crane . Sorry . Can 't be too careful . This is Anton Koslow and Anna Ravec . Like everyone else , you wonder why . For the moment , the important thing is not why ... but the fact that you have defected to the West . Admiral Nelson , I have long admired your work . Maybe someday you and I will have moments for deep philosophical discussions . That 's once we get you safely back to the United States . There 's a horseshoe cove about four miles south of the harbor . We rendezvous there with the Seaview in 45 minutes . You come with us , Miss Ravec . We 'll meet at the cove . [ Machine Gun Continues Firing ] [ Groans ] [ Man ] Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea . Starring Richard Basehart ... David Hedison . Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea . Right after they opened with those machine guns ... she ducked into a doorway and out of sight , and that 's the last I saw of her . A good thing too . She 'll be all right . Now that Koslow is safely on his way , they won 't bother her . Are you sure he 's safely on his way ? Let 's see what the doctor has to say . Doctor ? - What are his chances ? - I 'm not sure yet . He 's lost so much blood . I didn 't know anyone could lose that much blood and still survive . We 'll just have to wait . He 's strong , and he 's stubborn . - There 's always hope . - Mmm . Top priority scrambler message . All set , sir . - Circuits 7-Z-3 . - [ Keys Clacking ] Code number 4362 Alpha . Urgent , please advise . Repeat . Urgent , please advise . Koslow badly wounded in escape from Jakarta . Code number 4362 Alpha . - That 's the Seaview . - Uh-huh . - Check the earliest airline flights toJakarta . - Right . - Trouble ? - In great big pieces . I 'll brief you on the way to the airport . How long is it gonna take them to come to a decision ? - [ Knocking ] - Come in . Scrambler message just received from Washington , sir . - Code 827 Alpha . - Thank you . Lee , help me decode this . We 're to sit tight . They can 't risk having Koslow die without telling everything he has to tell . They 're flying out an expert to rendezvous with us ... and make the trip back , debriefing Koslow en route . He should be here by morning . You saw the shape Koslow 's in . He might not last until then . He has to . He has the key to the entire Southeast Asia Red spy network . We can 't lose that information now that we have it right within our grasp . [ Both Shout ] [ Groans ] Very impressive , Victor . Vassilof is dead . You snapped his back . Well , isn 't it better to weed out the incompetents here rather than in the field ? Are you the perfect pupil ? Or is it that I 'm the perfect teacher ? - Well , I suppose ... - It doesn 't matter . What is important is that now we have need for your ... very special talents . I want this man Koslow . Excuse me . Do you have a light ? - Thank you . - You had me worried , Mr. Parker . I 've been waiting the past hour . I thought your plane would never get in . Seemed that way to me too . We were bucking a 40-mile-an-hour headwind most of the way . How much farther is it to the Seaview ? Just 15 minutes more . She 's anchored up the coast about 20 miles up ahead . - Care for some music ? - Sure . Why not ? - [ Click ] - [ Groans ] [ Vehicle Approaching ] There 's a car now , sir . It 's a black sedan . Could be it . Easy does it . Aren 't you a little off course , mister ? Not if the Seaview 's up ahead . What makes you think it is ? We 're glad to see you , Mr. Parker . We were beginning to feel landlocked . Okay , Curley , he 's our man . Now , you just continue on up the road . It takes a bend about a quarter of a mile . You can see the Seaview from there . We 'll meet you . Right . Admiral Nelson . - Mr. Parker . - Welcome aboard the Seaview , Mr. Parker . - Let 's get under way , Lee . - Mr. Morton , prepare to get under way . Aye , sir . Prepare to get under way . I suppose the first thing you wanna do is see Koslow . More than just see him , Admiral . A lot more . This way , Mr. Parker . Shouldn 't Koslow be awake by now ? The sedative should be wearing off . - Chip , change that to a bearing of 283 degrees . - Change to 283 degrees . The charts indicate we 'll be in deep water about 35 miles offshore . Which will be right about here . Then we 'll submerge and operate directly due east at full speed . Fine . Send this ... a top priority scrambler message . Code number 7-2-9 Beta . If that 's going to Washington , tell them I 've been aboard for over an hour now ... and I have yet to start my debriefing of Koslow . [ Sighs ] Include Mr. Parker 's remarks . Doctor , any change ? Not much . His breathing 's a little easier now . We 'll know a lot more when the sedative wears off , and he 's awake . And when will that be ? - Soon . - How soon ? Mr. Parker has to have some answers from Koslow as soon as he comes to . - That 's impossible . - Nothing 's impossible . Admiral , as it is , it 's a miracle Koslow 's alive . - If he has to undergo questioning ... - I must question him ... and I must do it the first moment possible . It 'll kill him for sure , Admiral . And what if I don 't question him , and he dies anyway ? Our country needs those secrets , Admiral . In this case , the information is more important than the man . Advise Mr. Parker as soon as Koslow is conscious . - Yes . Yes , I understand . - [ Knocking ] Come in . - Yes , Lee ? - Koslow 's awake . - He wants to talk with us . - I 'll call you back . - Easy . Easy , easy , easy , Koslow . - [ Muttering ] - Just relax , now . He 'll be here . - No ! The admiral will be here . Easy , easy . You 've got to take it easy . - Admiral Nelson ... - Just take it easy . - Just take it easy . Relax , now . - No ! No ! [ Continues , Indistinct ] - Easy . Easy . - Where is he ? - Where is he ? - Easy , easy . Now , take it easy . Admiral Nelson , they just told me . Anna is not aboard the Seaview . It couldn 't be helped . We were separated during the attack . But you promised ! You promised us both safe passage aboard the Seaview . I 'm sure she 'll be all right . They won 't bother her now that you 're out of the country . Won 't they ? Don 't I know what they 'll do to her ? Was I not one of them for so long ? You 've got to stop this . You 're killing yourself . It doesn 't matter . Nothing matters without Anna . You must go back for her . We have a secret hiding place . She will be there . You must find her . You must bring her here . She must be here , safe with me . But we can 't go back . Our presence here is known . The faster we get away from here , the better . The admiral 's orders are to get you to Washington as quickly as possible . No , that is not correct . I 'm sure the admiral 's orders ... must be to get my information to Washington as soon as possible . You will not get a word of that information ... until Anna is here ... safely aboard the Seaview with me . It seems as if we 're backed in a corner . Order the Seaview to come about , Lee . We 're going back for her . The girl who lives here , where is she ? I don 't know . I know no one who lives here . - Where is she ? - I don 't know . ! It was empty . I sneak in , try to find something to steal . You 're running out of time . Please , I know nothing . - Where have they taken her ? - They 'll kill me if I tell you . And I 'll kill you if you don 't ! Now , where is she ? - Vanderhoven mansion . - Where is that ? It 's on Java Head Road , to the north of town . - Which floor ? - Second floor , west . [ Groans ] - [ Muffled Shout ] - Anna , it 's Nelson . Anton ... Is he all right ? He 's aboard the Seaview badly wounded . He won 't leave without you . How did you find me here ? Not now . Get dressed . We gotta get out of here fast . All right . [ Ringing ] - Yes ? - [ Foreign Language ] [ Continues ] [ Foreign Language ] [ Men Shouting ] You had us worried . Took a little longer than we planned . I ran into some trouble . - Anton ... How is he ? - Better than we expected . - Oh , please . I must see him . - You better get some rest first . I 'll speak to the doctor . We 'll get you in soon . - I 'll have one of the men show you to your quarters . - Welcome home , Admiral . You must be Anna Ravec . - Mr. Morton , prepare to get under way . - This way , Anna . [ Footsteps Approaching ] The latest medical report on Koslow ... says he 's still a long way from being out of danger . I know . The doctor tells me he needs all the rest and quiet he can get . Maybe we should hold off on Parker 's briefing . No . You saw the instructions from Washington . They need those answers as soon as possible . - And they 'd also like to have Koslow alive . - Yeah , right . We could set up another sick bay for the crew and make the prison one off-limits . That 's a good idea . At least it 'll cut the traffic in there down to a bare minimum . - I 'll see to it right away . - Fine . [ Morton On Speaker ] Admiral Nelson . [ Sighs ] - Yes , Chip ? - It looks like we 're getting a change of weather up ahead . A change of course to avoid underwater turbulence might be advisable . All right . I 'll come right down to the control room . [ Door Closes ] Colonel Dubov , come in . Colonel Dubov , come in . [ Buzzing ] - Come in , Colonel . Colonel Dubov . - Come in , Victor . Everything is proceeding according to plan . There have been several small delays , but the time is now right . Good luck , Victor . Koslow must be silenced . But remember , you 're also very valuable to us . Don 't worry . I 've just checked the Seaview 's blueprints . I have all my escape routes planned . See you soon , Colonel . Very good , Victor . - Excuse me . - Sorry , sir . No one 's allowed inside . Admiral Nelson said I was to have complete run of the ship . - Sick bay 's off-limits . - But now that Miss Ravec is aboard ... - I 'm supposed to debrief Koslow . - I don 't know about that , sir . I just know that the sick bay is off-limits . Where is Admiral Nelson ? I must see him immediately . You 'll find him forward in the observation nose . [ Footsteps Approaching ] Your orders from Washington instructed you to give me complete cooperation . I 've just been refused entry to sick bay . You know I must talk to Koslow immediately . The sick bay off-limits order has several exceptions , and you 're one of them . - It 's just a misunderstanding . - Lee , will you take Mr. Parker back to sick bay ... and see that all this is straightened out ? I 'm sorry , Admiral . I guess I got a little excited . - It 's just , there 've been so many delays . - I understand . I guess we 're ... we 're all under pressure . And in the future , you will pay careful attention to all orders ... and carry them out exactly as given . - Yes , sir . - As you were . Please go in , Mr. Parker . [ Soft Clang ] Oh , Miss Ravec , I didn 't see you there . - How is he doing ? - Better . Much better . You must have stayed up with him all night ... and you 're probably quite tired by now . Why don 't you get some sleep ? He 'll be all right . I 'll stay right here and watch over him myself . Thank you , Mr. Parker , but no . I 'll be all right . He 's done so much for me . I owe him so much more than just a few nights ' sleep . Where is she ? She would not go and leave me alone . She didn 't . She 's quite a girl . She wouldn 't leave until she was sure there 'd be somebody right here looking after you . See , so much fuss was made when I wouldn 't leave without her . Where in all this world do you find a girl like Anna ? Yeah . I know what you mean . I used to feel the same way about a cute little nurse from Toledo . - Oh ? - And then my hospital insurance ran out . [ Both Chuckle ] No ifs , ands or buts . I run a tight ship . When I say relax , that 's an order . Thank you . I know . You 're very kind . - But I must get back to Anton . - He 's perfectly all right . - The doctor 's with him right now . - Oh , no , he 's not all right . It will never be all right with him again for as long as he lives . They 'll never leave him alone , no matter where your people hide us . They 'll find him . They 'll find him , and they 'll kill him . No . He has done us an enormous favor ... by defecting to our side and offering to tell all he knows . We 'll keep our part of the bargain . He 'll find a safe haven where he can live out his life in peace . If only I were as sure as you . - There . That ought to do it for now . - [ Sighing ] I 'll look in on you again in an hour . I 'm sorry , Mike . I didn 't think the captain would jump on you that hard . It 's all right , sir . It is all right to go inside , isn 't it ? Yes , sir . You heard what the captain said , sir . You 're to have complete run of the ship , sir . You 're sure now ? I wouldn 't want to get you into any more trouble . Yes , sir . I 'm sure . Ah . Hello , Mr. Parker . So at last we get together . Yes . At last . [ Crane On Speaker ] Urgent , Mr. Parker . Come to the radio shack immediately . Repeat . Mr. Parker to the radio shack immediately . - Repeat . Urgent ... - Mr. Parker , you 're being paged . Oh , uh , yes . I 'll be along in a minute . There 's an urgent message for you from Washington , Mr. Parker . - Use this microphone . - Come in , 8-KR-24 . Repeat . Come in , 8-KR-24 . This is 8-KR-24 . Come in , Seaview . - There they are , Admiral . - It 's all yours , Mr. Parker . [ Man On Radio ] Come in , Warren . Number 3 , Special Unit 731 requests additional information . Boston Triple Charlie . Repeat . Boston Triple Charlie . Chicago Orange 89 . Chicago Orange 89 . Repeat . Chicago Orange 89 . That 's not Warren . Keep him busy . Thirty-five Ranger Green . Thirty-five Ranger Green . Repeat . Thirty-five Ranger Green . Chicago Orange 89 . [ Man On Radio ] Repeat . Thirty-five Ranger Green . Perhaps you 'd better add a sign-off . But I 'm not finished yet . You 're wrong . You 're very much finished . You 're not coming in clearly , Captain . What I 'm trying to tell ... [ Grunting ] Stop him . ! Stop him . ! Stop that man . ! You two , the cabins . You two , there . - Nothing , sir . - There 's no sign of him anywhere . One thing 's certain . He can 't go very far . But he can do an awful lot of damage until we find him . We 'll find him . Miss Ravec , have you seen Parker ? No . What 's going on ? All right . All we know for sure is that Parker 's not who he claims to be . - Anton ! - No . He 's all right . The guard has orders not to leave his post . Oh , please . I must be with him . All right . Come on . This is the admiral . All search parties ... will converge forward to the control room immediately . Carry on . You stay right here . Nothing . Not a trace . There 's only one other place he can be . [ Snaps Fingers ] The ventilation system . Wiley . Around here . This is the admiral . Lee , my men are now starting ... from the extreme aft ventilator and will work forward . If he 's in there , he 's somewhere between us . All other search parties will continue to probe all deck areas frame by frame . Carry on . Continue search . Anna ? - What is that ? What is happen ... - Nothing for you to worry about . You are always here when I need you . Anna , everything has moved so fast these past few days . I wanted so many times to tell you of the new life ahead for us . Not now . There will be so much time later for us to talk . Now you must sleep and get all the rest you can . Anna , Anna , always thinking of me . What would I have done without you ? Sleep now . Anna , I wanted ... No ! No , no ! Not you ! You taught me , Anton . The Party comes first . Death to the defectors ! No . ! Help . ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help me ! Help me ! Get him out of here . - You all right ? - Yes . I 'll get the doctor up here on the double . - Take care of him . - All right . [ Door Closes ] - [ Shouting ] - It 's all over now . [ Sobbing ] There 's no place left to run ... or hide . You must thrive on excitement . The doctor says you even improved a little through it all . Anna . Anna . Double agent . And I wouldn 't leave without her . This man who posed as Mr. Parker ... He too was one of their agents ? Yes , Anna and this man ... his real name is Vail ... were both agents of Colonel Dubov ... both working unknown to each other . If one failed to kill you , the other would have . Double agents . Triple agents . Where does it all end ? That 's something you 'll have to tell us . Yes . As soon as I get to Washington .

 Today 's top of the news comes from the top of the world . The unpredictable Admiral Harriman Nelson has done it again . His brainchild , a fantastic atomic submarine with an amazing glass nose is now undergoing final tests below the ice at the North Pole . To sit in judgment on the final test the Bureau of Marine Exploration has sent a seaplane with its top officer , the former vice admiral B.J. Crawford to rendezvous with the submarine Seaview in the Arctic . Flying with him is the congressional watchdog of the budget penny-pinching congressman Llewellyn Parker who had fought a losing fight against what he had termed " Nelson 's Folly . " And so the question of the day comes to this : Will the final test on the U.S.O.S. Seaview turn it into " Nelson 's Folly " or will it be another triumph of a great man a great inventor who , despite his oddball reputation may yet emerge as the predominant scientific genius of our time ? So bon voyage , Admiral Nelson . Good luck , Seaview . Well , gentlemen , modesty forbids my adding anything to that . - Shall we take her down , Captain ? - Aye , aye , sir . - Let 's make it 90 feet at the start . - Aye , sir . Diving stations . Diving stations . - Any time you 're ready , Mr. Thompson . - Aye , aye , sir . Stand by . Clear the decks , Mr. Thompson . - Decks clear . - Decks clear . Prepare to dive . Close all main ballast tank vents . Stand by to blow tanks . Ballast tanks full . - Close the vent . - Flood negative . Full dive on the planes . Fifteen degrees down bubble . Secure the air . - All agreed ? - All agreed . Dive ! All dive ! - Pressure in the boat . - Up scope . 9-0 feet . Level off at 9-0 feet . Down scope . All ahead two-thirds . All ahead two-thirds . - Final trim , Captain . - Carry on . Well , final trim , sir . Depth : 9-0 feet . Speed : Two-thirds . Well , Lee , it 's been a long , tough haul from conception to execution but , my boy , we 've done it . You 've done it , sir . It bears out what you taught us at Annapolis . " The wild dreams of today are the practical realities of tomorrow . " I 'm glad you remembered one of my more temperate quotes . Some of our colleagues haven 't been quite so diplomatic . Say , speaking of diplomacy , we 've got some guests to entertain . I 've met ' em . Now it 's your turn . And just remember , they hold the purse strings to this " folly " of ours . - Shall we dress ? - Dress ? Black tie . Let 's go . - Take the conn , Ed . I 'll be fore . - Aye , aye , sir . Beautiful , isn 't it ? It 's the most exotic thing I 've ever seen . No more , thank you . Admiral . Nice to see you , sir . - Captain Crane , Dr. Hiller . - How do you do ? - Congressman Parker . - How do you do , sir ? You have an expensive toy here , Admiral . Though it is suitable for sightseeing . Quite right , sir . We hope to see sights never before seen by man and by seeing , solve some of the mysteries of the deep . Sorry for the brief hello when you came aboard but this toy of mine is a demanding lady . Aren 't we all . Washington probably thought you needed a woman 's touch around here . - Research project , isn 't it ? - That 's right . The reaction of crewmen under conditions of lengthy confinement ? Yes , Admiral , and I appreciate the honor of being the only woman aboard . - Ah , but you 're not . We have another one . - Oh ? You 'll meet her . Shall we see the rest of the ship ? Well , I did think that was the purpose of our visit . - Doctor . - Congressman . The control room , the brain of the sub . Over here , we have our chauffeurs . It takes two to run this toy - helmsman and planesman . Now , on a submarine , it 's always Christmas . That 's what I 've been telling Congress . Wrong deduction , sir . That 's our Christmas tree . Tells us when we can dive . Now , if we go down before all those lights are green we start bailing . Over here we have our ballast control . - How does it work ? - Like an elevator system , Doctor . Takes us up and lets us down . Now , on this side that is radar . This is sonar . Sonar keeps us from running into anything under the water . Radar does the same thing on the surface . Try this one , Congressman . Two " S " s in " progress . " Now if you 'll come down here , Doctor . This is our missile tracking tape . If we have to shoot , at least we like to know where the missile 's going . And if we do shoot , over there are the buttons . The trick is to know which one . Suppose the other fella shoots first ? In that event , sir , that 's the way out . This way , Doctor , please . And watch your step here . The radio shack . Lee ? - Excuse me . This way , please . - Sparks ? Make that Washington call in exactly 11 minutes . Aye , aye , sir . Not even Jules Verne dreamed of anything like this . - The world 's only undersea aquarium . - What on earth is he doing ? - Shark walking . - Shark walking ? Come on , Bessie . Come on . You want to get well , don 't you ? For ages , man has been trying to learn the secret of the fish . Now we have a perfect underwater laboratory . Well , Lucius , back with your fish again , I see . B.J. It 's nice to see you . Commodore Emery , this is Dr. Hiller and Congressman Parker . How do you do , Commodore ? I still don 't understand what he 's doing . The commodore regards all sea creatures as personal friends . He 'd rather be remembered for his discovery of a new fish than as one of the leading physicists of our time . - May I explain ? - I wish you would . My little friend Bessie here , we had to drug her in order to do some tests . Now I 'm trying to force some water through her gills so she doesn 't drown . In her present condition , she wouldn 't even bite a congressman . Well , then she 's the only one on board who wouldn 't . Oh , you 're much too sensitive , Congressman . Right you are , Doctor . - Come along , everybody . - See you later , Lucius , I hope . Come on ! Hup , two , three . Come on . Get going . Watch your step there . You 've seen the brain of the sub . In here is the heart - the atomic motor room . - Careful , sir . That 's our warning system . - Disregard . No one is allowed in there , not even congressmen . You understand . For your own safety . Now , down here you 'll find the sting of the ship . In fact , there are more stings in here than in a hornet 's nest . The missile and escape room . Congressman , there is more destructive force in this room than in all the explosives used in World War II . The missiles are for research . Experimental torpedoes . You name ' em , we 've got ' em . Show ' em , Lee . Right . Well , let 's see . Here 's something new . This is a magnetic primer . In case we lose power in the control room we just slap this dude on by hand , and away she goes . This looks like a pineapple . Some pineapple . One bite , and pow . - Well , don 't worry . It can 't activate itself . - Captain ? - Yes , sir ? - Where does this door lead to ? That leads to Davy Jones 's locker , sir . I would suggest if you contemplate using it , you use this . - No , no , thank you . - No offense , sir . Red . - Yes , sir . - Well , shall we continue ? B.J. ? Take a look at this lad . He 's Seaman Smith . - Recognize him ? - Should I ? Seems only yesterday you were bouncing him on your knees . - Smith , Ol ' Bricktop 's boy ! - Yeah . - Spittin ' image of him too . - Isn 't he ? His mother wrote me that he finished his hitch in the navy so I had him sign up with us on the double . He looks a little big for me to bounce on my knee now . Yeah . - Jimmy , isn 't it ? - Yes , sir . And now you 're a minisub man . How do you like the new model ? She handles like a dream , sir . I can 't wait to test her under the ice . - You will . Good luck , my boy . - Thank you , sir . Sorry to break in on your social life . Back to work . This should interest you , Doctor . Dr. Jamieson , Dr. Hiller , Congressman Parker . - How do you do ? - Happy to meet you , Congressman . - Thank you . - The Dr. Hiller ? It 's a pleasure to welcome such a distinguished psychiatrist aboard . You flatter me . You seem very well equipped here and pleasantly unoccupied . Well , we 're hoping to keep it that way with the help of these little gadgets . Afraid it 's mandatory that you wear our newest style in submarine sportswear . - May I ? - Thank you . If you pick up a fatal dose of radiation , it glows red . A fatal dose of radiation ? Oh , there 's a warning . It loses all its color first . By the way , give me one of those for Admiral Crawford . I hate to break this up , Doc , but I have some healthier places to show our guests . I 'll check in later with you , Doctor . See ya . This way , please . Ah , there you are . I 've just introduced our guests to Dr. Jamieson . By the way , Admiral , I have your dosimeter here . Good man , Jamieson . He 'll keep you well filled in on statistics . Attention ! Well , Admiral , I ... I suppose she 's your dancing dietitian ? And he 's your musical chef ? - She is my secretary . And as for him ... - Sorry . - I 'm to blame , sir . I started it all . - I have no doubt of that . Doctor , I told you another woman was aboard , ... but I hardly expected you to meet her under such boisterous circumstances . It all seems very gay and happy , and I am here to observe . Yes , not choreography to a trumpet ! Mr. Romano , belay that noisy horn . As for you , Miss Connors , we shall have a little talk later . Doctor . I 'll have a little talk now , Lieutenant , outside . Romano , aren 't you about due back on duty ? Not for another two minutes yet , sir . - Now , Lieutenant ... - Yes ? - Yes , sir . - Sir ! I 'm sure your act will get a wonderful review in the Congressional Record . - Will they break me , Captain ? - Well , they 've broken better men for less . How do you explain this undignified behavior ? I was just showing them how I 'll dance at my wedding . I see . Well , that is an extenuating circumstance . - In about three weeks , isn 't it ? - And two days and four hours . Who 's the unlucky man ? Pardon me , Captain . May I ? By all means , Lieutenant . What did you say about undignified behavior , Captain ? Captain Crane . Control Room , please . We 'll continue this discussion later ... Lieutenant . Calling Seaview . Calling Seaview . - Come in , Washington . - Hello , Seaview . - We 're making contact , sir . - Very well . - You called me , sir ? - Yes . We 're just about through to Washington . Stand by to take her deep . - Come in . - All set , sir . Inspector Bergen 's on the line . - Bergen , Nelson here . - Forget the amenities . How 's she running ? Like a clock . We 're all set to make our dive under the ice . 3-4-2 . - Make it 500 feet . - Aye , aye , sir . We 'll be out of sound range in a few seconds , Bergen and then ride radio silence for the next 96 hours . - Give him my regards . - B.J. sends his best to you landlubbers . Is he seasick yet ? He was the worst sailor in the navy . - Well , good hunting . - Thank you , Inspector . Keep a lamp burning . - Hi , Susan . - Oh , hi , Cathy . Personnel file you asked for . Oh , thanks . Have some hot coffee ? Best prescription you 've written today , Doctor . Say , this Captain Crane of yours is surprisingly young for a job this size . He was the youngest sub captain in the navy . He must have a friend at court . The admiral ? It 's a bad diagnosis , Doctor . They are almost like father and son , but the captain earned his rank . Neither he nor the admiral would have it any other way . Oh . No criticism intended . I 'm sure you 'll both live happily ever after . You know , settling down isn 't going to be an easy adjustment after all this . Well , I was born on a farm , and I 'm going back . We bought a small ranch in Colorado . - What do you read ? - Can 't make it out , Captain . - Iceberg , sir ? - I don 't know . - Nose camera . - Camera on . Take over . I 'll be fore . Here they are . - Admiral ... - How deep are we ? Riding at 500 feet . 650 left from keel to bottom . Take her to a thousand . Take her to a thousand feet . Emergency ! - Sonar ? - Clear overhead , sir . - Surface ! - Surface ! Surface ! Congressman , you and the ladies go aft . It might be safer there . Break out the polar gear . Let 's go , B.J. - Just breaking surface , sir . - All stop . - All stop . - Crack the hatch . - Crack the hatch ! - Let 's go . Come on , B.J. My God ! The sky 's on fire ! What happened ? Come on . Let 's find out . Get Washington . - Hurry up . Make it quick . Get Washington . - Aye , aye , sir . There 's a bad magnetic storm , sir . - Can you clear it ? - I 'm trying , sir . U.S.O.S. Seaview calling Washington . Come in , Washington . - I can 't seem to break through , sir . - Keep trying . Admiral Nelson calling Bureau of Marine Exploration . Inspector Bergen . Rescue team , up and out on the double ! Man on the ice . Belay the parkas . Rescue team , topside , on the double ! All set , sir . Inspector Bergen 's on the line . - Pipe this through the ship . - Aye , aye . Bergen , we 've just seen it . What is it ? Nelson , we 've been calling you for almost three days . - What 's that fire in the sky ? - It 's the Van Allen Belt of radiation , ... the 300-mile level . It caught fire about 50 hours ago . Nobody knows how , but a South African observatory reported heavy meteor activity at about the same time it exploded . - Theoretically , it 's possible . - What 's the forecast ? We just don 't know . The U.N. has called an emergency scientific conference . It 's working around the clock . The world 's top brains are there ... Pittar , Zucco , Charbier - and the president wants you there on the double . - Can you send a plane for me ? - Impossible . Thermal conditions have grounded all aircraft . There 's nothing flying anywhere in the world . The temperature has reached 135 degrees and there 's no way of knowing how much hotter it will get . DEW line headquarters just below the pole reports the polar ice caps are melting . Okay , Bergen , we 're on our way . Be there in two days . Godspeed . Out . - Let 's get going , Captain . - In a moment , sir . Picked up a survivor . He 's in pretty bad shape . Doc , lend a hand . Must 've been out there for two days . He 's burned to a crisp . - Who is he ? - I don 't know . Let 's get him to sick bay . - Take her down . Full speed . New York . - New York ? Aye , aye , sir . - He had this pooch with him . - Take care of him . - Here are the man 's papers . - Take her down , periscope depth . Dive ! Full dive on the planes . Flood negative . - All ahead full . - All ahead full . - What 's his name ? - Miguel Alvarez . A civilian scientist . Doing a government survey on Ice Floe Delta . - He 's lucky to be alive . - So are we . Yeah . - How is he , Doctor ? - Severe exposure . Small wonder lying out there in 135-degrees heat for two days . - Listen , Doctor . - Jim , you there ? I can 't hold on . It 's breaking away . The ice floe 's drifting . Jim . Jim . Can you hear me ? Mac , you there ? Mac ? Mac ? There must be others still out there on that ice . This is the captain . Reverse course . Repeat : Reverse course . Rescue team , stand by . This is Admiral Nelson . Hold your course . You heard what the man said . We can 't leave this area without searching for survivors . Captain Crane , if we waste any time at all here there may be no survivors left anywhere in the world . Help me ! Please ! Help me ! Mac ! Mac ! I 've got it , Lieutenant . Sir ? I didn 't know there was a regulation about not picking up survivors . Lee ? Lee ? The chances are no one 's still alive out there anyway . He was still alive , wasn 't he ? The blazing Van Allen Belt continues to spread a path of death and destruction across the world . The rising heat has touched off raging forest fires in the Ural Mountains of Russia the Black Forest of Germany , and the rich French timberlands . These film clips from the northwest ... Let 's see how the rest of the crew 's taking it . The situation grows more desperate with a report that emergency shipping ... - Are they still at it , Cookie ? - For more than 24 hours , sir . And they 've eaten nothing but coffee and pencils in all that time . - Excuse me . - I better see if he needs me . The projection must be on the nose . No margin for error . Now , if these figures prove out ... Keeping you awake , Harry ? Yeah . Now , the last temperature reading ... It checks . It checks ! On the nose ! Lucius , I think we 've hit it . Oh , you 're always so sure of everything . If the temperature maintains the same rate of progression ... - If . - Yes , if . - And if we can reach there by the 29th ... - 29th ? - It has to be the 29th . - ... and project at exactly 16 hours ... B.J. , it 's right . I don 't see how we can miss ! Do you need me , sir ? Huh ? Oh , uh , no , Connors . Thank you . And close the door on the way out , will you ? - Yes , sir . - Lucius ? - Now what ? - Get off that couch . Let 's double-check these figures . I do more walking for you than I do with the shark . Yeah . Now , at the present rate of temperature rise ... The fiery sky is now threatening to strike a mortal blow at the heart of the Midwest farm belt . Thousands of acres of vital grain have already shriveled under the intense heat giving rise to fears of famine if the flaming belt continues to rage unchecked . In Italy , all roads leading to Rome and the Vatican have been jammed for two days . From all over Europe , the faithful have been streaming towards St. Peter 's to pray for deliverance from the catastrophe which has struck the Earth . Here now , our television satellite camera in outer space showing the frightening ring of fire encircling the Earth . Ladies and gentlemen , this concludes our broadcast for today . Well , there will be a hot time in the old world tonight . That 's not even funny , Mac . - Attention ! - As you were . Well , you 've all seen it . There 's not much that I can add except to tell you that the situation is far from hopeless . Right now in New York , the greatest scientific minds in the world are working around the clock analyzing ways and means of survival . And don 't forget , we have two of the best scientific minds right here on this boat . Sir ? Sir , what about leave ? I live in New York , and I got a baby that 's new in the family . I 'm sorry . There hasn 't been any word on leaves yet . But I 'll keep you all posted . We 've just received word that Admiral Nelson is in the building and he 's walking through the lower hallway . Excitement has been at fever pitch since last night 's radio report from the submarine Seaview that the admiral had conceived a plan which hopefully might extinguish the flaming Van Allen Belt . Now , several theories are already under consideration by the U.N. In fact , yesterday , Dr. Zucco , the eminent physicist of Vienna presented his own plan which in essence says , " Hands off . Let 's wait and see . " Unofficial sources tell us that Dr. Zucco 's arguments swayed the scientific body , and they might give him their stamp of approval . However , in view of Admiral Nelson 's tremendous scientific achievements we 've been advised that the international scientific committee is standing pat until Nelson 's plan can be evaluated . Pardon the interruption . Some woman is a bit hysterical . Nerves are on edge . And this may be one of the most important moments in history . The admiral and Commodore Emery ... are coming into the conference room right now . We thank the French delegate for his remarks and we will take them under advisement . We acknowledge the arrival of two of the world 's most distinguished scientists ... Admiral Nelson and Commodore Emery . And now , the chair will listen to Admiral Nelson . Mr. Chairman distinguished scientists , ladies and gentlemen . This planet is impaled on a roasting spit slowly but inexorably being seared and blistered by the fire in the sky . If the Van Allen Belt continues to burn , the world will burn with it . And no one can doubt that civilization as we know it will disintegrate if the temperature should rise to 175 degrees . Now , in the last five days , the recorded temperature rise has been two degrees every 24 hours . If that rate is maintained our planet has a life expectancy of about three weeks . Therefore ... Therefore , if we are to avoid cremation we must act at once . Lucius , let me have those charts of ours and the maps , will you , please ? Thank you . Now , if I may make a comparison . When a diseased appendage threatens the life of a human body a doctor has no choice but to amputate . We have no choice either . We must amputate the belt , or die . Amputate ? How ? Not with a knife , Doctor , but with a shot in the heart . The burning belt must be exploded clear of the Earth 's magnetic field . And we have exactly 16 days and three hours in which to do it . How do you arrive at that particular timing ? How ? The admiral and I have worked out the mathematical formula and , believe me , our figures are correct . Oh , he irritates me . The shot must take place on August the 29th at exactly 4 : 00 p.m. The location of this operation is as vital as the time . A place 205 miles north-northwest of Guam in the Marianas Islands . To be exact ... Where are those figures , Lucius ? Ah . To be exact , latitude , 15 degrees north longitude , 145 degrees east . The location and the time are dictated by the Earth 's rotation and the consequent trajectory of firing . Firing of what , Admiral ? An atomic missile , Doctor , fired from the submarine Seaview . The missile will arc along the burning belt . As it detonates , it will seed the flames with an overdose of radiation causing the belt to explode outward into space . To simplify it , take a toy balloon . A little too much air , and poof . No balloon . A little too much radiation , and ... Poof ! No world ! Insanity ! Insanity ! This lunatic scheme will destroy us all . You gentlemen care to look at our figures ? Give me those . The admiral 's scheme is suicidal insanity . You should know that , Commodore . Explode the belt , and you explode the world ! Not if the blast is directed away from us . No , no , no ! I am diametrically opposed . I know the chemical composition of the gases within the belt at the rate of consumption by fire . My calculations cannot be wrong ! I say the belt will burn itself out . At 173 degrees , it will burn itself out ! Fine . What if it doesn 't burn itself out ? You have your plan . I have mine . Time will judge which one is right . Doctor , our plan can 't wait . You say the belt will burn out at 173 degrees . At the present rate of climb , that 's August the 30th . We say it won 't burn out , but we can 't wait to test our theory because we must fire the missile on August the 29th . Otherwise , we lose our angle of trajectory . Then this scientific body must decide which one of us is right . I 'm not gonna wait and watch the world burn to a crisp . I have 16 days to get to the Marianas and I shall need every ounce of speed and every precious moment of time . Lucius , have the captain stand by to get under way . I say the admiral 's scheme be referred to committee ! - There 's no time . - Then I call a vote . All those in favor of the admiral 's scheme ? All those against ? - There 's your answer . - Not mine , yours . My answer shall come only from the president of the United States . - Look out ! - We 'll never get out of the building . We go out the basement . Sir , what about the congressman and admiral ? There 's no other way . We 'll have to leave them behind . Whew . This heat . Hold these , Lieutenant . Get out of this . Aboard ship ! Cast off ! Clear the decks ! You all right ? I 'll tell you in just a minute as soon as I get my breath . - Crash dive . - What ? You heard me . Crash dive . The U.N. police are on deck . A crash dive will kill ' em . Give ' em a 15-second warning to clear off , and then dive . That 's an order . Come on , Lucius . Attention . This is the captain . This sub will dive in 15 seconds . Clear the deck . Sound the klaxon . - Camera . - Sail camera on . Close all main ballast tank vents . Repeat warning . This sub is diving immediately . Clear the deck . Clear the deck . - All right , take her down . - Prepare to dive ! - Ballast tanks full . - All green . Dive ! Dive ! Bow 's under . Deck 's awash . Stern gone . Take the conn , Lieutenant . I 'll be in the admiral 's cabin . Aye , aye , sir . Lee ! He had no other choice . I hope Washington agrees with you . I don 't understand ordering a crash dive with men on deck . Zucco just can 't be right . You 'd better make deadly sure he 's wrong . - Come in . - Sir . Oh , forget it , Lee . Military police swim like fish . It 's part of their training . Now here 's our goal : The Marianas . And we 've only got 16 days to get there . What do you think , Captain ? If the Panama Canal is knocked out to go around the Horn doubles our distance . In my opinion , I 'm afraid it 's impossible . Impossible ? Sounds like Zucco . Nothing is impossible . We 'll make it if we get the president 's permission . Captain , set your course for the Marianas as though we already had that permission . - And give us all the speed you can make . - Sir ... Captain ! Very well , sir . Doctor . Mr. Alvarez . I 'd forgotten you two were still aboard . My orders did not include a trip to the Marianas or wherever you 're headed . Admiral , I must get off this submarine . There may be no chance to get into port , Doctor . I 'm afraid you 'll both have to go along for the ride . Yes ? Sparks , sir . No contact yet . Since the heat went over 139 , radio contact is highly erratic . The radiation has set up a field of static . Forget the technicalities . Keep at it . I must talk with the president . - Aye , aye , sir . - Now , look here , Admiral ... Doctor , as I remember , your research project was " men under stress . " You couldn 't have picked a better laboratory . Glad to see you up and about , Mr. Alvarez . Sorry you didn 't get ashore but I 'm sure we 'll be able to find something to keep you busy . Don 't worry about me , Admiral . Man must accept what is ordained . That 's a convenient rationalization , but under the circumstances there seems to be no alternative . - Check the heat . - Up scope . - How hot is it up there ? - 141.2 degrees . No snow today . Down scope . U.S.O.S. Seaview calling Washington . Come in , Washington . Twenty-five hours of static in my ear . Man , I 'm gettin ' shell shock . And I 'll say it again , loudmouth . You talk pretty big behind the admiral 's back . Yeah ? Well , here 's a message for you , special delivery . Break it up ! Hold it ! Hold it ! Knock it off ! All right , Smithy ! All right , break it up ! Attention ! Now , I don 't know who or what started this but I 'm telling you , the next fight ends up in the brig . - Is that clear ? - Yes , sir . Now you two men shake hands and forget it . Carry on . - Question , Captain . - Shoot . Are we headin ' for the Pacific ? I 'd answer that question , Gleason , if I could , but I can 't yet . Well , we certainly are headin someplace mighty fast . Sir , maybe home soon . I can tell you this . We 've been heading south for the last 25 hours . Whether or not we stay on course depends on the president . The admiral 's still trying to contact him . As for home you 'll be holding that new baby on your knee before you know it . But what about this burning belt , Captain ? Captain Crane , I just picked up Miami . - That 's my hometown . - What about that , huh ? Sparks , this is the captain . Pipe it through the ship . Aye , aye , sir . And the news from Paris is just as disastrous . The rising water of the Seine has overrun its banks flooding out thousands of homes in the low-lying areas . From Moscow , scattered reports indicate a severe shortage of water as wells from the Ukraine to the Steppes all dry up . In China and India conditions are chaotic as riots and pestilence sweep the land . Meanwhile , the heat has burned like a giant torch across the face of Africa . Terror-stricken herds of wild animals fleeing from the blazing forests to the open plains are dying of thirst around mud-caked water holes . Other reports indicate that steaming water from the melting North and South Poles are being sucked into the air currents spreading weird , freakish fog banks throughout the world . In many areas , dense fog severely hampers vital operations . In this country , the blistering heat continues to blaze a path of destruction across the Midwest grain belt . The rich farmland of America is now almost a waste ... Excuse me . - What 's the matter ? - What 's the story , Captain ? - Sparks , did we lose contact ? - No , sir . The admiral ordered a news blackout . All right , knock it off ! Yes ? Sir , may I ask why you blacked out the news ? A matter of morale , Captain . No news is better than bad news . I can 't agree , sir . This is no time to cut the men off from the world . There may be no world at all if we don 't start making news instead of listening to it . - May I be excused , sir ? - Go . What was that about the fog bank ? Do you remember ? Lee ! All right , Lee . Simmer down . Now , I know the admiral was rough , ... and I also know about maritime regulations . - It had nothing to do with regulations . - Lee ! It 's a matter of common decency ! The men are worried sick about their families . They have a right to know the facts , good or bad . Lee , come have a cup of coffee , talk it over . I don 't want any coffee . Please ! Now , you know the admiral as well as I do and we 've never known him to be wrong on a question of policy . - Even if it ruins morale ? - That 's just what he hopes to avoid ! He has a strange way of showing it . There may be some here whose friends and loved ones have already gone to meet their maker . If it is God 's will that they and we shall die , so be it . A joyous reunion can be only a brief moment away . That 's enough , Mr. Alvarez . That 's more than enough . What kind of talk is this anyway ? - I only came to offer comfort . - Comfort ? You offer defeatism ! May I remind you this is a federal ship , and these are federal seamen . By what right do you dare preach of imminent death of meek resignation to the inevitable ? - Captain , I ... - Nothing is inevitable except defeat for those who give up without a fight . I 'll remind you to keep your sniveling philosophies to yourself . Now get forward and stay away from my men . As you wish , Captain . Carry on . Lee ! Please , don 't do it . Come in . Yes , Captain ? Still upset about that news blackout ? As a matter of fact , I am , sir . And more than that , this man Alvarez is trying to subvert the crew . If I 'm gonna meet your deadline in the Marianas , ... I need fighters , not fatalists . Then order Alvarez to keep away from the crew . I 've already done that . But if I might suggest , sir it would help if you treat the crew as men and not like children . If you 'd just let them in on your plans ! That has always been my intention , Captain , but only at the proper time . - Sparks ! - Sir ? - What luck with Washington ? - Static 's gettin ' worse , sir . That Miami pickup was just a freak . Now all contact 's blacked out . Very well . Now what ? If you can 't reach the president ... - I haven 't given up trying . - But the radio ... - Where are we now , Captain ? - Sir ? Just exactly where are we ? - We 're right here , sir . - Good . Set a course , close in toward Cape de Sao Roque . May I ask why , sir ? Static caused by magnetic storms may knock out radio , ... but it won 't affect a telephone cable . - Telephone cable ? - Yes , Lucius , right here . Our mine detectors should locate it easily where it crosses the continental shelf . - Have Engineering rig a tapping device . - And tap the cable ? If we can 't reach the president by radio , we 'll tap the cable and phone him over the Rio-to-London telephone cable . I like that , Harry . Thank you . - Check your mask . - Right . - Check . - Alvarez , I thought I asked for volunteers . - That 's right . - A little out of character , aren 't you ? Hardly out of character , Captain . Undersea work was part of my job . All right , let 's move out . - All clear ? - Clear . Secure the hatch . - Hatch secure . - Prepare to flood . - Ready here . - Divers ready . Slow flood . Slow flood . - Let 's hope this works . - I wouldn 't count on it . - There 's the signal . They 've found it . - Where ? Right out there . - Get Sparks . - I can 't see anything but the signal . Stand by , Sparks . They 've located the cable . - Should be a connection in a minute . - Aye , aye , sir . Connection made , Admiral . Hello ? Hello ? This is submarine Seaview . Can anybody hear us ? - Hello ? - Something 's coming in . - Can you hear us ? - This is London . Hello ? This is London speaking . Can you hear me , London ? This is submarine Seaview , Admiral Nelson . I hear you , Seaview . Go ahead . Could you patch me through to Washington ? Hello ? Hello ? Come in , London . Sorry , sir , not a chance . We 've been out of contact with the States for 35 hours . There 's no answer on either the north or south cables . Harry , we 'll never get through . Could you relay a call through the telephone satellite ? Impossible . The whole system 's flooded out . London 's been evacuated , and ... Hello ? Hello ? Come in , London . Are you there ? Hello ? Break the connection , Sparks . Order that last man in . Aye , aye , sir . Lee ? Oh , am I glad to see you ! Am I glad to see you . What do you say , Doc ? Apparently , no ribs broken . You 're very fortunate , Captain . He 's all right . Where 's Alva ... Thanks . It was a perfect shot . Saved my life . - My hand was guided by the Lord . - Perhaps . But I 'm glad your fatalism didn 't run its obvious course . Lee ! I 'm sorry . That was uncalled for . Thanks . This will have to be seen to , Doctor . - Bring him to sick bay . - Please come this way . How about you , Romano ? - In the pink , Captain . - Good . You had me kind of worried there for a minute . - I had myself worried . - Lee , are you all right ? Well , I 'm still in one piece . What 's the news , Admiral ? Disastrous . For all they know , there isn 't any Washington . - No London either from the sound of things . - What do we do now ? Let 's get the ship under way , then have the crew stand by for an announcement . - Aye , aye , sir . - Lucius . I 'm about to make the most important decision of my life , ... and I 'd like you there . - Connors . - Yes , sir . - Sparks ? - Sir . - Pipe this through the ship . - Aye , aye , sir . Ready , sir . Now hear this . Men , this is a time for decision . You heard the tragic news over the cable . Contact with Washington is now impossible . This means we can 't get presidential approval of my plan . Therefore , the final decision must be made now . There are only two choices . So with higher directives unavailable and by the authority vested in me I have made that final decision . We are headed for the Marianas to fire the missile . Now , it 's a race against time a countdown of only 14 days in which to cross half the world . If we are to win that race , and we must sacrifices will become daily obligations . The new work schedule will be posted immediately . And I tell you now , it 's a rough one . Just one thing more . Our world faces its darkest hour but I am convinced that , with God 's help my plan will succeed and the world will survive . That is all . - Doctor . - Captain . - Just checking on Alvarez . - He went forward with Dr. Jamieson . - Seems to be all right . - Good . I wish I could say the same of some of the others . George Young . I 've given him a sedative . Nervous hysteria . After all , Doctor , he just became a new father and it 's only his second trip . It 's not necessarily a question of experience . Now , here 's a veteran , your engineer , Lieutenant Hodges . Lieutenant . What seems to be your problem , Mr. Hodges ? Just don 't feel good , sir . I 'll be okay in an hour or so . You try and get some rest . We 'll manage . - Yes , sir . - Doctor . - What happened to him ? - Same thing . Hyper neurasthenia . Your crew is like a capped oil well . When tension builds up , there 's bound to be an explosion . But these are handpicked men . Therefore with eyes to see and minds that question . They know the world 's probably on the brink of oblivion but instead of trying to get to their homes and finding their families here they are , racing under the sea driven on by one man 's wild scheme , which has no proven scientific basis . Doctor , this is a submarine , not a nursery school . - And the admiral 's orders must be obeyed . - I wonder . Professionally , I am interested to know if the admiral always behaves this way . - This ruthless compulsion that ... - Doctor . Doctor . Excuse me . Where are we , Romano ? Sub 's right here , Skipper . We ought to raise the ... - Engine Room , what happened ? - The generator 's gone out , sir . - How bad ? - Don 't know yet , sir . We 're checking . - All stop ! - All stop , sir . What is it , Lee ? It 's the generator . They 're checking on it now . - It 's an armature , Captain . - How long to fix ? - About 10 hours . - We can 't afford to wait 10 hours . It 's dangerous not to wait . Radar and sonar are both knocked out . - We can 't move without ' em . - Yes , we can . There 's nothing wrong with the motors . As for sonar and radar these are safe waters . Keep moving and rush those repairs . That 's an order , Captain . - All ahead two-thirds . - All ahead two-thirds . Get on those repairs on the double . - Hello . - Oh . - Oh , you startled me . It 's so dark in here . - I 'm sorry . Well , I 'm the one that 's sorry . I didn 't thank you for saving Lee . That was a very brave thing you did , risking your life to save his . We 'll all die when our time comes . You really believe the world is coming to an end ? Yes , I do . I had time to think about it out there on the ice . At first , I was puzzled . But then I began to see things clearly . As a child , I was pledged to the church but my mind was filled with doubts enough to make me turn my back on my chosen path . But out there , the fire burned away my doubts and I saw the truth crystal clear in my mind and in my heart . - I found peace again . - And resignation ? Has man a right to even try to oppose God 's will ? Why should God want to destroy us ? Haven 't we tried to destroy ourselves ? I don 't agree with anything you say . I won 't . I doesn 't matter . Perhaps our death comes even sooner than the others . Mines ! Lee ! Mines , mines ! Dead ahead ! Hundreds of mines ! - All stop ! - All stop . - Take over . - Aye , aye , sir . It 's caught in the searchlight casing , sir . - All back . Dead slow . - All back . Dead slow . - Hold it ! All stop ! - All stop ! We 've got to clear it from the outside . Frogmen . No , we 're too deep . Use the minisub and a torch . Burn through the cable . - Minisub in all these mines ? - Can you think of a better idea , Captain ? I could a couple of hours ago when I suggested we wait for repairs . You made your point . The responsibility is now mine . Aye , aye , sir . Harry , take it easy . This is the captain . We 're in the middle of a minefield . A cable is caught on the forward searchlight . I need two volunteers for the minisub . - Gleason , sir . I 'll go . - Right , Gleason . Okay , Red , here 's your chance for that joyride . Smith , sir . Count on me . - Right , Smith . - Hey , that 's young Jimmy . Now , look , this is a pretty touchy situation , so play it cool . Aye , aye , sir . - Aye , aye , sir . - Good luck . Damage Patrol , stand by ! What are your orders now , sir ? Back out of the minefield dead slow . Then proceed with caution until the generator is fixed . Aye , aye , sir . All back . Dead slow . All back . Dead slow . Are you all right , sir ? Yes , yes , of course , Connors . Perfectly all right . Are you , Harry ? Gleason was a good man . So was young Smith . Little Jimmy . Look , you have no right to brood , Harry . You had to take a gamble . Otherwise , your entire plan would have been wrecked . The commodore 's right , sir . If the generator hadn 't gone out ... - You 're both very kind , thank you . - Kind ? No , I think ... Hey , that 's pretty good , isn 't it ? Only about six hours . What do you say , Connors ? - What 's that ? - Nothing important . It seems that somebody 's concerned about my health and welfare . - Yes ? - This is the captain . Please come to the sick bay , sir , at once . - Very well . - Now what ? Let 's find out . Come along , Connors . Hodges ? He smashed in the medicine chest and swallowed these , Admiral . He must 've typed that note on my machine . " I was to blame for the death of Gleason and Smith . " " I sabotaged the generator ... " " ... although only God knows why I did this terrible thing . " - Sabotage ? - He wasn 't responsible , Admiral . It was a severe nervous breakdown . That 's beside the point , Doctor . All right , Captain . You blamed me for the death of Gleason and Smith but here is positive proof that those men were victims not of my impatience , but of deliberate sabotage . - Any comments ? - Yes , sir . Sabotage might be just the beginning . You 're driving my crew to the point of exhaustion possibly even rebellion . These are men , not machines . If they break down or blow up , we 'll never meet your deadline . We 'll meet it because we have to meet it . I 'm not worried that your men can 't take it . They can . But I am concerned about your alternative : Rebellion . I found this note in my cabin just a few minutes ago . " If you continue your lunatic project , you 'll never live to see it completed . " Hodges will never see it completed . And he won 't bother you anymore . I 'm not so sure that he did . These notes were not typed on the same machine . Double the security guard . All men off duty are restricted to quarters . Until proved otherwise , everyone is suspect . - Lee ? Don 't turn against the admiral . - I 'm not turning against anybody . Lee , let 's not argue , please . Not now . Not now . Lieutenant . There is something you can do to help . Take this note sent to the admiral . - Run a test sample on all the typewriters . - I don 't have to . The dot 's off the small This was typed on my machine . - In the admiral 's office , Cathy ? - Yes . - Captain , may I speak freely ? - Please do . You 're so concerned about your crew that you 're overlooking other danger signs . Admiral Nelson 's becoming a textbook case . Taciturnity combined with anxiety , high irritability . And now , perhaps delusions of persecution . Delusions ? The admiral could 've typed that threatening note himself . Susan ! How can you consider such a thing ? Cathy . Thanks very much for your diagnosis , Dr. Hiller . The admiral is showing signs of strain . However , I 'm sure he 's in complete command of his senses . I hope so . We still have a long way to go . Fire in the admiral 's cabin ! Lee ! The admiral 's cabin ! - Step up the power to the ventilators ! - Lee ! Lee ! It 's not smoke . Look up here . It 's gas ! Surface ! Surface ! Ship off the port side , sir . Glasses . Looks becalm . On the ship ! On the ship ! Do you read me ? Do you read me ? On the ship ! Do you read me ? Shall I send out a boat , sir ? We can 't proceed until we ventilate anyway . Very well . Rescue team , up and out on the double . Check forward . Check aft . Let 's go . Dead . They 're all dead . Let 's go . - What 'd you see out there ? - Dead men . Dead men on a dead ship . Ain 't it about time we went home ? Yeah . You 've all got families , haven 't you ? Well , how about it ? Leave it to me ! - Yes , Lieutenant ? - It 's a complete derelict , sir . Just four days out of Honolulu . Everyone 's dead . The heat , no water . We found this in the bar . It 's the Hawaiian Times . It 's dated last Thursday . I 've been asked to speak for some of the crew , sir . - What is it , Kowski ? - We 've been feeling this way for days , but ... Well , I guess that dead ship brought it to a head . Brought what to a head ? Sir , the men feel if it 's really the end coming they ought to be spending their last hours with their wives and families . Now , we respectfully demand , sir , that you take us back home . I see . May I remind all of you that this is a government ship . Demands made by a crewman or an officer could be considered mutiny . Shall I so consider it ? Well , speak up ! Captain , as a civilian , may I say a word ? The world may end at any minute now . Certainly at such a time , ... these men have a right to choose where to die and with whom . - Listen , Mr. Alvarez ... - Just a minute , Captain . Mr. Alvarez makes a valid point . I do not believe the world is ending . If I did , I 'd be heading for home myself . But in fairness to everyone , there is some recent news that may have a bearing on your decision . It comes from a Honolulu newspaper found on the derelict yacht . The headline reads : " World Subs Ordered to Stop Seaview from Firing Missile . " So in addition to all our other problems , we are now a hunted ship and we may never get a chance to fire the missile . This in no way alters my plans . This ship will hold its course . But in view of this news and your request the men who want to go home may do so on that yacht . I think you 're fools to try it but I 'll supply sufficient water and food to give you a good fighting chance . Admiral , if we 're to meet your deadline to the Marianas it 's madness to split this crew . - In view of the threat of mutiny , we ... - It 's not mutiny yet , Captain . Your challenge was not taken up by the men . All our trouble stems from the fanatical desire on the part of some , not all of them , to go home . I 'd rather have a small loyal crew than risk further sabotage . - Admiral ... - That 's enough , Captain . Men , you have 15 minutes to make your decision . Please have any in the sick bay that want to go placed aboard the yacht . One of you doctors better go along . The other , stay here . Dr. Jamieson , I would say that this looks like a job for you . Yes , sir . Get the supplies rolling , Captain . Excuse me . - All clear on deck ! - Very well . Captain , take her down . - Take her down ! Hundred feet . - Hundred feet , flood negative . Are you all right , Admiral ? Perfectly all right , thanks to Captain Crane . Well , Mr. Alvarez , I see you decided to stay with us . Stay or go , what 's the difference ? What 's to be will be . - That guy gets on my nerves . - Cheerful , isn 't he ? Stern 's under . Deck 's awash . - Full speed ahead , Captain . - One moment , sir . Lieutenant , I ask you to take official note of my protest against the admiral 's actions . - Actions ? - Yes , sir . Despite my objection , you encouraged desertion . I can 't argue with that . You 're within your rights to record a protest . But , Lieutenant , you can also record this . Desertion or not , we 're better off without a murderer on board . The note I found was no idle warning . That fire in my cabin was deliberately set . Begging your pardon , sir . Romano . Fire detail found a cigar burning on the floor , sir . - Meaning I was smoking in bed ? - Apparently , sir . Apparently , sir . Except I ran out of cigars before I went to bed . Lieutenant , file the captain 's report . Then have my cabin cleaned up . I 'm going to check supplies for more cigars . Delusions are typical in cases like this . - I 'll be in my quarters . - Aye , aye , sir . Yes ? Hi . Buy you a cup of coffee ? - Look , Lee ... - Now , wait . Wait just a minute . I appreciate your blind loyalty to the admiral . I felt that way myself until his lunatic actions started to follow a pattern . - Lunatic actions ? - All right , is this rational ? No search for survivors on Ice Floe Delta . Crash-dived in New York with police on deck . Sent a minisub into a minefield which killed two of my men . He had to take the chance . Drove a fine officer to sabotage and suicide . Produced a threatening note which he probably wrote himself . Then he dreamed up this so-called murder attempt which was actually his smoking in bed . - I believe him . - And now , the final straw ! He approves of desertion when we desperately need every able-bodied man on this sub . - Lord knows what he 'll do next . - Or what you 'll do next . Is that it ? " Procedure under which a subordinate officer may relieve a superior of his command . " - That 's just in case . - Of what ? If I decide the admiral is irresponsible . Irresponsible ? Then what are you going to do about the missile ? It has to be fired . Why ? If the admiral is crazy , his plan is crazy too . The U.N. thought so . They 've got subs out looking for us right now . Well , Professor Emery believes in it . I 'm sorry , but until I say so , the matter 's closed . Sir . Less than eight degrees to Dr. Zucco 's burn-out point . 165 . Let 's hope he 's right . Hang it up . What 's our position ? Guam 's due south of us , sir . Just 12 miles to target . - Yes ? - This is the captain . We 're 12 miles and 50 minutes to zero . Missile ready for firing ? - All ready , sir . - I 'll speak to the ship . - Sparks , pipe the admiral though the ship . - Aye , aye , sir . Go ahead , sir . This is the admiral . The missile is primed and in exactly 49 minutes it will be fired . Shortly thereafter , we should know if our long voyage across the world has been justified . With luck , we 'll soon be on our way home . That is all . Connors , we 're all out of aspirin here . I 'm sorry , sir . I 'll get some . - Susan , where do you keep the aspirin ? - Top drawer , over there . Thank you . - Lucius , what happened to you ? - Oh , nothing . I got a little too close to one of my sharks . You know Bessie . - Will he be all right , Doctor ? - It 's not serious , Admiral . I thought Bessie was a friend of your ... Lieutenant , you should be on duty . Not me , sir . I 'm beat . - Aren 't we all ? Get forward . - Sorry , sir . As a sick man , I take my orders from the doctor . Sick , huh ? In my judgment , you 're faking . With clue respect , sir , I think your judgment 's been a little rocky lately . Why , you goldbricking pip-squeak ! What brought that on ? - Go on , tell him . - I don 't know . What do you mean , you don 't know ? Tell him . First , the doctor tells me to rest . Then the admiral comes in and orders me back to duty , then pow . Doctor , I request you certify the admiral as irresponsible , if you agree . - What ? - I certainly do , Captain . Master at Arms , Sick Bay on the double . Hold it , sir . It was all my fault . I was disrespectful . - Captain , you can 't arrest the admiral . - Of course you can 't , Lee . Any other decision would be dangerous for everybody else on board . Captain , that missile 's scheduled to be fired at 4 : 00 . Are you still going to permit this ? I guarantee the admiral 's plan is sound . Dr. Zucco and our finest scientific minds don 't agree . - Dr. Zucco . - You can 't do it , and I 'm going to warn him . Lieutenant , confine yourself to your quarters . That 's an order . Follow me . - Yes ? - Dr. Hiller , this is the admiral . - Is the captain still there ? - He has just gone forward , Admiral . Sir . Sir , I deeply regret this , but under federal regulations number 249 , governing conduct on the high seas ... I am forced to relieve you of your command . Arrest ? - Not arrest , sir . I 'm placing you on sick list . - And if I refuse ? I 'm afraid you have no choice . I must also inform you of this , sir . - I 've decided not to fire the missile . - Lee , for the love of heaven ... Most of the scientists agree the fire will burn itself out at 173 degrees . I 'll wait and see . Lee , you must fire that missile at 4 : 00 , or we lose the angle of trajectory . - Detail . - Captain , this is Sonar . Unidentified fast propellers bearing 0-9-0 about 2,000 yards astern . They 've found us . Torpedo approaching to starboard ! Left full rudder . Battle stations . Take off . Sparks , contact that sub and tell them we 're not firing the missile . Sonar , switch pickup into the P.A. Battle stations ! Battle stations ! - Move ! Move ! - Battle stations ! Too close . Sparks , can 't you reach that sub ? - There 's no answer , sir . - Rig for attack ! Ready torpedoes ! No , no ! We can 't fire on a U.N. sub . We 've got to make a run for it . Torpedoes approaching starboard ! Left full rudder ! - We 're a sitting duck . Dive ! - I 'm giving orders aboard this ship . I 'm not challenging that , but I built this ship ! We can take the pressure of the Mariana Trench . That sub can 't dive as deep . - Dive , Lee , dive , for heaven 's sake ! - Dive , dive ! Dive ! Dive ! - 400 feet ! - 400 ! 600 . 800 . - 1,200 feet . - 1,200 . - 1,400 feet . - 1,400 . - 2,300 feet . - 2,300 . 2,400 . - 2,500 feet . - 2,500 . Torpedoes approaching port side . Right full rudder ! Fools . They 'd better get up fast . - 3,200 feet . - She 'll blow ! - All stop ! Check for damage ! - All stop ! Damage Control , make check ! Fire detail , on the double ! Return to stations ! Return to stations ! - Full emergency power ! - Full emergency power ! All full ! Captain , this is Sonar . We 're picking up something else , real close . - Well , it can 't be another sub . - Not at this depth . Lee , what the ... Power Room , reactors up full . Shoot a charge through the hull . Aye , aye , sir . It must give way . - Full emergency power ! - Full emergency power ! It 's breaking loose . That did it , Lee . - All ahead full . - All ahead full . Now what happened ? Power Room . Power Room ! - Power Room ! Power Room ! - No answer ? Negative . Control Room , what happened to the reactors ? - Don 't know , sir . They just quit . - I 'll find out myself . The admiral 's scheme is suicidal insanity . If you pick up a fatal dose of radiation , it glows red . You gotta stop the admiral . He 'll destroy the world . Doctor , what were you doing in there ? Making sure you don 't reach your target position by 4 : 00 . So you were the saboteur . Control Room ! Switch to auxiliary , fast ! Aye , aye , sir . Moving on batteries , sir . Very well . What 's the temperature reading ? 173.2 , and the fire 's still burning . I knew it . Zucco was wrong . There is no burn-out point . Stand by to fire . - Aye , aye , sir . - Sail camera , prepare to track missile . Sail camera on . Missile Room , stand by , number eight tube . - Missile Room standing by . - Target position in 10 minutes . This is the missile room . Hatch opening now . We 've made it , Alvarez . We 'll fire that missile on time . I think not , Admiral . - Alvarez ! - No man has a right to challenge God 's will . Have you gone completely mad ? Put down that bomb . Man has sown the seeds of sin . Now he will reap the whirlwind . Everybody , stand still . Lieutenant , get away from the missile button . Don 't move , Admiral . Hold it ! Attention , everyone ! This is Alvarez . I have a bomb . - A bomb ? - If anybody tries to fire the missile I 'll blow up this ship . Captain Crane , wherever you are , see that no one interferes . - Cathy . - Commodore , where 's Lee ? Come on . We have no time to lose . We must find him . - Lee ! - What 's the matter ? What 's the matter , my boy ? - What happened ? - Alvarez has a bomb . He 's holding the ship at bay . We 've only got a few minutes , and the missile 's got to be fired . Alvarez is covering the control room . - There must be some other way . - You go to your quarters . Only eight more minutes , Admiral and it will be too late for you to do anything . Diving gear , on the double . - Which hatch is opened ? - Number eight , sir , just under the bridge . Alvarez , for heaven 's sake , man , come to your senses . If the missile isn 't fired in six minutes ... It won 't be . God 's will is written across the heavens . Alvarez , are you saying that man must accept destruction even though it 's in his power to avert it ? It 's not for us to judge , Admiral . Freeze ! Not to judge , maybe , but we can reason . If God ordains that man should die without a fight then why does he give us the will to live ? Your time 's run out , Admiral . This is the admiral . Surface ! Surface ! Surface ! Surface ! - You did it ! - Lucius , we did it . - Admiral , sir . - Lieutenant . - Thank you , sir . - Good luck , lad . - Thank you . - Admiral ? Lee . - Full speed for home , Lee . - Aye , aye , sir .

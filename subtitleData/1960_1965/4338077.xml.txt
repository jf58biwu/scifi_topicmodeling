 [ Loud Pop ] [ Chattering ] [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Cheering Continues ] [ Gong Sounds ] [ Nelson ] It was the week before Christmas ... but in this far-offland , the people prepare for quite another event . For it is written that each year ... the lords of the kingdom must weigh their king ... and balance his royal weight with much fine gold ... a measure of their true devotion . [ Explosion ] [ Announcer ] Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea . Starring Richard Basehart ... David Hedison . Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea . [ Playing Badly ] [ Continues ] [ Men Singing ] [ Singing Christmas Carol ] - [ Whistling , Cheering ] - This time tomorrow ... home sweet home ! - [ Chuckles ] - Na Zdrowie . ! - To ... [ Indistinct ] - No kiddin ' , Chief ? You going all the way back there just for Christmas ? Did you ever spend a Christmas in New England , Kowalski ? - No . - You haven 't lived . Gangway ! Hot stuff comin ' through ! - Hey , Cookie ? - Yeah ? - What 's goin ' on up there in the nose ? - Hey , yeah . I thought the admiral and the captain were comin ' back to join the party . Important business meeting up there . No time for parties . - Hot stuff comin ' through ! - [ Chuckles ] How long ago did this happen , Mr. Johnson ? - Exactly four hours and 35 minutes ago . - [ Smacks Lips ] Forgive me , sir , but why does the State Department ... feel called upon to involve us in this matter ? Admiral Nelson , the murder of King Vanyan ... was the first step in a very carefully planned coup . In a matter of days , his country could be lost to the West . But that still doesn 't explain why Seaview is needed . Captain Crane , the next rightful heir to the throne ... happens to be right here in California ... at the moment , on tour . His embassy called on us for help the moment ... the moment the king was killed . Hmm . Now they feel that the prince 's life might be in danger . That 's part of it , certainly . But the new king could be the one factor ... to prevent the loss of his country . They begged us to get him back safely ... in time to prevent the revolt . Well , if speed is a factor , then , well , why not fly him ? Secrecy and security are as vital as speed . We 're only doing this to help a valued ally . How soon can we expect this , uh , prince ? A matter of minutes . You 'll have to get under way as soon after that as possible . Mr. Johnson , my whole crew is looking forward ... to a 10-day shore leave for the Christmas holidays . - Now , what do I tell ' em ? - I 'm sorry , Captain , believe me . The mission is crucial , but we , uh ... we can 't order you to go . [ Sighs ] Well , Lee ? Well , I ... I better break the news to them now . [ Chattering , Laughing ] [ Crane On Speaker ] Now hear this . Now hear this . Attention , all hands . This is the captain . We have just been assigned an important emergency mission . It 's with great regret that I have to announce ... - the cancellation of all Christmas leaves . - [ Men Groaning ] A special Sea Detail will stand by for immediate departure . All personal luggage will be removed from dockside and restowed aboard ship . I 'd like to add that , like all of you ... I was looking forward to Christmas at home too . I share your feelings now . That 's all . [ Morton On Speaker ] Royal party aboard , Admiral . Captain Crane is escorting them down . Last word of warning before they get here . I can 't promise you won 't be tracked ... - possibly even attacked before you 're through . - Hmm . This promises to be quite a Christmas . Admiral , His Royal Highness and entourage . Welcome , Your Highness . We are pleased to be here . My military aide , Colonel Meger . - How do you do , sir ? - [ Prince ] And my governess , the Countess DeMarche . - Gentlemen . - And Georges , my valet . Uh , perhaps the prince would like some refreshments . Eh , we have some ice cream aboard . How-How about that ? Am I to understand that we have been brought here for a picnic ? - I 'd hardly call it that , Colonel . - Then let 's get to the point . We 'd like to know why we were spirited away to this boat without a word of explanation . There 's been some trouble in your country , Colonel . - Revolution ? - Why do you say that , sir ? Because that is what I fear , we all fear . Gentlemen , is my father all right ? Please be still . This is important business . Please ! Is my father all right ? Your Highness , my government deeply regrets to inform you ... your father is dead . No . No , he 's not ! No ! How ? How did it happen ? Assassination . Only hours ago . - Why were we not told ? - Your government thought it best to keep it quiet ... for the prince 's protection . - [ Quiet Sobs ] - You mean ... the prince 's life may be in danger . Is in danger , Countess . That is why you were not permitted to contact your embassy , Colonel . We wanted no one to know when or how the prince was returning . [ Weeping ] - Your Highness . - [ Sniffles ] My government extends its deepest condolences . You are in the very capable hands ... of Admiral Nelson now . He will see to it that you get safely home . Good-bye , Your Highness . Admiral . Countess . This is the absolute truth about my father ? - Yes . - Then I am the king . - Now I give the orders ! - Now , Your Highness ... - A prince is always courteous to his elders . - Silence ! I am the king . No one can say " no " to me anymore ! I 've secured the special Sea Detail and set the first watch , Skipper . - We 're running all ahead standard . - Very well , Chip . - Let 's take her down . - Aye , aye . - Prepare to dive . - Prepare to dive . - Dive ! All dive ! - [ Klaxon Blaring ] Ten-degree down bubble . This is the best cabin ? - Better than all the others ? - It is . Then it shall be mine . Uh , these happen to be my quarters , Your Highness . Do you refuse to give them to me ? - I was only trying to explain that ... - Uh , Admiral ... do you wish to keep the friendship of our country ? - Th-The cabin is yours , Your Highness . - That is better . Arrange for my valet to be nearby . Oh , Admiral , I 'm looking for the king 's quarters . - This is now the king 's cabin . - Oh , but this was yours , wasn 't it ? - Mm-hmm . - He 's an interesting little boy , isn 't he ? Tell me , Countess . Exactly what are your duties to the king ? Well , I 'm his teacher ... in French , English , manners , deportment . - I teach him to be a royal gentleman . - Really ? And who 's teaching him how to be a royal human being ? [ Gunshots ] Someone was here . They came to kill me ! My pistol . I told you never to touch my pistol . You just don 't care . Nobody cares that somebody tried to kill me ! Now , now , Your Highness . Just , uh ... Just tell us what happened . Someone came in here with a knife . It was dark . I couldn 't see . - They came to kill me . - You were having a nightmare . No , it was no dream . There . Does that look like a dream ? Admiral , this is an outrage . You want me dead . All of you , and that 's the truth . You want me dead . ! [ Instruments Pinging , Beeping ] Captain , would you take a look at this ? How long have you been getting these readings ? Intermittently , sir . And always at extreme range . - Any trouble , Lee ? - I don 't know , sir . Three or four times in the last hour , we 've gotten flash readings at extreme range . Maybe it 's nothing but a passing school of fish . Or another vessel . Are we being shadowed ? Well , the thought 's crossed my mind . Johnson warned me of the possibility . We 'd better alter course . I agree . Maneuvering , come to course 1-4-1 . [ On Speaker ] 1 - 4-1 . Aye , sir . - What 's he doing there ? - He took over the periscope island . I will not move away , so do not ask me to . I will stay here , where I can see and be seen . - You feel safer with everyone around , is that it ? - Yes . Admiral , how are we supposed to run a ship with this kid underfoot ? Do not speak to me that way , Captain ! - I am king , and you will show me due respect ! - Now , look ... Eh , eh , eh , gentlemen , le-let 's simmer down . If His Highness feels safest here , I 'm sure the captain will understand . I 'm not interested in his understanding . Someone wishes to kill me . I intend to remain on guard . In fact , I will have my lunch served right here . Of course , Your Highness . I can 't get the attack on the boy out of my mind . Lee , have you taken every possible security precaution ? Yes , I have . But just between you and me , Admiral , couldn 't he have made the whole thing up ? He didn 't make up the assassination of his father . He certainly didn 't invent that knife . I 've got an uneasy feeling it 's going to be a long while before we settle this . But no one knew why or where he was going until after he came aboard . Well , one of his party could have had standing orders . - Standing orders ? - The moment something happened to the father ... they could 've had orders to proceed against the son . - Now , that 's quite possible , you know . - One of his own people ? There 's only one other possibility . One of his own people or a member of this crew ! Well , in my opinion , there 's only one person aboard who 'd be likely to attack him . - Who ? - Me . [ Laughing ] Message , sir . Thanks . Carry on . - I 'm afraid there 's nothing we can do about this . - Nothing we can do ? A ship 's gone down . We 've got to search for survivors . We can 't alter course . Our orders are specific . There are other ships in the area , Lee . They can search for survivors . - Aye , sir . - I can see you don 't approve . Well , it 's not that . It 's just hard to believe ... that one spoiled kid could be worth all this . - [ Christmas Carol Over Speaker ] - We hold our course . - [ Continues ] - Can 't Sparks pipe in any other kind of music ? - What do you expect ? It 's getting on to be Christmas . - Don 't remind me . Imagine one little kid lousing up Christmas leave for a whole crew . Yeah . I was sure lookin forward to that trip home . It 's not just that fresh kid , it 's the whole gang of them . Bunch of stuck-up hardnoses ... [ Continues ] Just a minute ! Where do you think you 're goin ' ? - His Highness would like to have his lunch . - Oh , he would , would he ? Well , you just tell Your Highness he 'll have to take his turn like everybody else . - I 'm busy . - I intend to prepare it myself . No , you don 't ! No one allowed in this galley but me . You will let me pass , or I will have you thrown into irons . [ Cookie ] Take it out . ! Go on . ! Take it out . ! [ Continues ] [ Rapid Pinging ] There it is , Captain . We 're picking it up again . - What do you make of it ? - It could be a sub . I 've got to assume that 's exactly what it is . - Keep scanning it . - Aye , sir . Maneuvering , all ahead flank . Take full evasive action . [ On Speaker ] All ahead flank . Full evasive action . Your Highness . ! Your Highness , I was not allowed to enter the galley to fix your lunch . - The cook lifted a cleaver to me . - A cleaver ? - They lifted a cleaver to you ? - What 's the trouble here ? - Why , how dare they ? To a member of my staff ! - Well , Your Highness . Just a moment . How can I settle anything if I don 't know what happened ? My valet has told me what happened ! And now I am telling you ! Admiral , can 't you get this kid out of here ? How dare you speak of me that way ! Admiral , I want this man arrested ! Your Highness , why don 't you shut up ? Short-scaled pinging . Fast propellers closing . - Bearing 0-9-5 , relative . - Mr. Morton . - Sound general quarters . - Aye , sir . - Battle stations ... - He may be a king , but I 'm captain of this ship . - Get him out of here on the double ! - You heard him , Colonel . - Move . - Come , Your Highness . Your Highness . It must be an enemy sub . - Torpedoes approaching ! - Rig for torpedo attack . - Hard left rudder . - Rig for torpedoes . Hard left rudder . - Ten-degree down bubble . - Ten-degree down bubble . Ready tubes five , six , seven and eight . Tubes five , six , seven and eight ready . Firing order ... five , seven , six , eight . [ Morton On Speaker ] Fire in five seconds , four , three , two , one . - Fire five . - Five fired . - Fire seven . - Seven fired . - Fire six . - Six fired . - Fire eight . - Eight fired . Scratch one sub . Admiral Nelson , His Highness sends his compliments ... and asks permission to return to the control room . I 'm afraid that 's a matter for the captain to decide , Countess . Oh , please , Captain . I 'm sure he 'll behave himself . Tell His Highness that he 's welcome here ... as long as he doesn 't interfere with the command of the ship . Thank you . I 'll convey the message . [ Sonarman ] Sir , another contact . - Range and bearing . - 10,000 yards . Bearing 3-2-2 , relative . - Not another sub , is it ? - I don 't think so . It 's an object on the surface . Any propeller sounds ? - None , sir . Whatever it is , it 's drifting . - We 'll have to investigate . Maneuvering , slow to standard ... and come to course 3-2-2 . - We 're at periscope depth , sir . - Very well . - Hold her there , Chip . - Object dead ahead , 300 yards , sir . - Slow to one-third . - [ Morton ] Slow to one-third . Everything all right , Your Highness ? - What 's happening now ? - We 're investigating an object on the surface . Let me ! Let me look first ! Is that an order , Your Highness ? It 's a request . You 're the captain . Well , in that case , be my guest . - See anything ? - No . [ King ] A man . ! There 's a man up there ! It 's a castaway , sir . Do I have permission to take him aboard ? Permission ? I command it ! The king has spoken , Lee . All we can do is obey . Aye , aye , sir . Mr. Morton , take her up . [ Morton ] Aye , aye , sir . Admiral , I beg you . You must not bring that man aboard . - Think of the danger . - Think of the man , Colonel . - Here he is , Admiral . - Very good , Lee . - Down scope . Take her down , Chip . - Aye , aye , sir . Why doesn 't someone help him ? - I command it . ! - [ Grunts ] Well , now , there 's a remarkable thing to encounter in the middle of the Pacific ... a boy no bigger than a sardine giving orders . Your Highness , think what you 're doing permitting this derelict to come aboard . - What do we know of him ? - Only that he is mine , Colonel . I found him , and he belongs to me . Bring the man to me ! You are welcome , friend . I found you , and I will protect you . I am the king , and I declare you my friend . Thank you , Your Majesty . After drifting around on the wide and empty ocean ... it 's comforting to hear one sweet and gentle word . John . That 's what he said his name was . - " John . " - No last name ? If he has one , he wasn 't telling me . Well , how did he get out there in the middle of the ocean in a lifeboat ? - Which story do you want ? - Hmm ? When I first questioned him , he said that he was a ship 's captain ... and his freighter had gone down in a storm . - Of course . The radio message we got . - Yeah , yeah . Yeah , that almost makes sense . But you say he told you another story . Yeah , he was in the crew 's mess . I was passing by . [ Chuckles ] You know what I heard him telling Curley ? - What ? - [ Laughs ] He said ... that he had been king of an island . - The volcano erupted , and the island sunk . - [ Laughing ] - And he , uh ... he got away in the lifeboat . - [ Chuckling ] He 's off his rocker . [ Chuckling ] I don 't know . You certain of that ? [ Playing Tune ] John ? Where did you get that ? Ah , well , this is the one thing I was able to salvage from my boat . And I think I ought to play you a tune on it , Your Highness , by way of appreciation . Because the food here is very , very good ... and the clothes are warm and dry , and I 'm a contented man . - And when are you going to invite me inside ? - Right now . Let him in . I 'll leave the door open , so you can keep an eye on him . Uh , pardon me . Now , then , what was this performance here all about , huh ? They killed my father , and now they want me dead . Ah , I see , I see . You 're an orphan , are you ? Well , sit down . Nobody to love and comfort you ... a poor little fish all alone in a wide and windy ocean , huh ? Ah , well , don 't worry . I 'm here now . - And I 'm just a big , friendly sort of a ... - Whale ? That 's it . And there 's a remarkable thing ... - a smile on the face of a sardine . - [ Laughs ] Good things are on the way . - Play me something . - All right . I will . Let me see now . Do you like that ? - What is that song ? - Ah , boy , that 's a song for a king . What does it say ? The minstrel boy to the war has gone In the ranks of death you 'll find him His father 's sword he has girded on And his wild harp slung behind him Land of song said the warrior bard Though all the world betrays him One sword at least His right shall guard One faithful harp Shall praise him Now , then , will you have a go ? Ah , you 're filled with fear , aren 't you ? Oh , now , you 're ... you 're surely not afraid of old John , huh ? - [ Chuckles ] No . - Well , then . - Where do you come from ? - [ Laughs ] Ah , you want to hear my story too , do you ? Well , boy , I 'm a treasure hunter ... and I just drift around from spot to spot ... looking and looking and digging and digging for treasure . - Did you ever find any ? - Ah , indeed , I do . Barrels of it . Great enormous chests of it ... - all the time . - Well , what do you ... what do you do with it ? What do I do with it ? Well ... I take it home with me . What else would I do with it ? And where 's home ? Way out beyond ... where the clouds ride on the shoulders of the sea . " Where the clouds ride upon the shoulders of the sea . " Now , all correct and down we go . There . There we are . Now , the two of us , we 're going to have a snug and happy home here ... full of fun and good cheer . Ah , but wait now . - There 's one thing I have to know . - What ? - Do you snore in your sleep ? - Why , no ! At least , I don 't think I do . Ah , now , that 's better . There 's an improvement . You 're not sure . You 're a wee bit humble . Now you 're beginning to sound more like a king . Sometimes I wish ... Well , what do you wish ? - I wish that ... - [ Knocking ] Who is it ? How did you pass the guard ? - Uh ... - I ordered it . Your Highness , I understand this man is moving in with you . - How does that concern anyone ? - Was it his idea ? No , I invited him . - I 'm afraid it 's impossible . - What did you say ? He 'll have to return to the crew 's quarters . He 'll do nothing of the kind ! He 'll stay here . But , Your Highness , I forbid it . The man may be dangerous . If he stays here , Your Highness , so will I. You will not be alone with this man . You will not address me again in such a tone , Colonel ! You are always watching me , following me . ! Perhaps it is you who wants to kill me . ! - Your Highness ... - Just get out , and leave me alone ! I give the orders . ! And my orders are thatJohn stays in this cabin . ! Always somebody trying to take something from me . ! John is my friend ! Now , get out , all of you ! Get out ! Now , now , now , now here . What 's a king doing having a tantrum , eh ? Now , you listen to me . If I was the king , I 'd quiet down . I 'd show a little dignity , a little serene majesty . That 's the style . That 's the mark of a king . Now , the colonel , he loves you . You do , don 't you ? Well , there you are . And look at the countess there . She loves you too . The pair of them ... they 're only thinking of your own good . There 's no point in saying otherwise , is there ? Well , Admiral , so I suppose it 's back to the crew 's quarters , eh ? - No ! No , he shall not go ! - Now , now . But you 're the only one I can talk to . I 've changed my mind . John , you stay here with him . Aye , aye , sir . - Admiral , you cannot do this . - I can and I have . I do not trust that man . It appears the king doesn 't entirely trust you , Colonel . Admiral , if anything happens to His Highness , I will hold you responsible . Only you . You Americans are so softhearted , Admiral . I hope you 've made the right decision , because it could be ... awkward for you if you haven 't . Good night . Pleasant dreams . [ Christmas Carol ] Come on , Chief . It 's your play . [ Kowalski ] Put a card down . Put a card down . ! Don 't hesitate , Curley . Sure , I only taught the lad the game today . He 's a beginner . Discard , friend . [ Plays Softly ] - Gin ! - [ Crewmen Laughing ] Our position is right here , almost at the mouth ofTaronga Bay . Then , we better ease off a bit , Chip . - Aye , aye , sir . Slow to two-thirds . - Slow to two-thirds . Bottom shoaling rapidly , Skipper . We 're approaching the harbor . - [ Crane ] All stop . - All stop . [ Crewman ] All stop . Any contact with the government people yet , Sparks ? No , sir . Only jamming . I don 't like the sound of that . We 've got the king , but who 's got the country ? Wait , sir . Here 's something . It 's from our embassy in the capital . I 'll run it through the scrambler . - Why can 't we ask them a few questions ? - Impossible . Any transmission from us would only pinpoint our location . All we can do is receive . " Rebels have captured the government television station . They 're telling the people that the Americans have killed the king and his son . " [ Chuckles ] The embassy warns us not to try to land . [ Sighs ] Great . We 've got the king , but we can 't tell anybody . We 'll find a way , Lee . As long as the boy 's alive , we have a chance . [ Grunting ] Guards ! Help ! Guards ! You ! It was you who tried to kill me ! Put this woman under arrest . Take her below . No . ! I want her put to death , now . - [ Crane ] Now , wait a minute . - Silence . ! This woman tried to kill the king , and now she must pay . Here , here , boy . That 's a tyrant 's way ... an eye for an eye . - Now , if I were king ... - Well , if you won 't do it , I will ! - [ Grunting ] - Stop it ! Take her below . Here , now , listen to me . As I was saying , if I were king ... I 'd let justice be carried out according to the law of the land . And that 's the way I 'd be a great king . John , I want you to bring His Highness forward to the observation nose . He has ... He has to make a very grave decision . You mean you want to take pictures of me with that ? Here ? Not here , in the radio shack . We can patch into your government 's channel with special transmission equipment . Oh , yes , I see . The people of our country will be able to see for themselves ... that their king is alive and ready to take the throne . It 's our only chance to get Your Highness back into your own country . But there are risks . We have to break silence . That means the enemy forces can locate us . Yes . What we have to do is dangerous . But it 's the only way . If it is my duty as a king , I will do it . My people , this is your king . I speak to you from a place not far from my kingdom . So you will realize that I am alive today ... and this is not a film of the past ... I tell you it is now close to midnight on the 24th day of December . I am here to beg you to rally to our throne ... to put down the rebels that wish to turn our government into puppets ... and ourselves into slaves . Gentlemen , I 've got good news . The embassy reports the government station is now back in loyal hands . - Then it worked . - Better and faster than we hoped . There are demonstrations everywhere for the new king . Sir , propellers above us , closing fast . Sounds like a destroyer . Rig for depth charges . [ Shallow Breaths ] Now , boy . Come on . Sit down . There we are . It 'll be all right . - Where 's that destroyer ? - It 's bearing 2-8-0 , sir . - It 's passed directly over us . - It 'll be back . - All we can do is lie here and take it . - I 'm afraid so , Lee . What we need along about now is a genuine miracle . [ Christmas Carol ] Well , will you look at the time , boy . It 's after midnight . Sure , it 's Christmas day , and , you know , I think it 's time ... that I delivered a Christmas present to the people of your country . - A present ? - Uh-huh . A king . Mmm , that 's going to be my present to them ... a real , dyed-in-the-wool ... royal king . Propellers , bearing 0-9-0 , relative , closing fast . Here it comes again . This time they 'll hit us with everything they have . [ Sparks On Speaker ] Captain , can you come to the radio shack ? - A message on the scrambler . - Well , they can 't help us now . There 's an enemy destroyer up there closing in for the kill . [ On Speaker ] Captain , this is Sonar . We 're getting multiple propellers closing fast . It 's not one destroyer . It 's a whole fleet headed for us . [ Teletype Clattering ] Gentlemen , those propellers we hear ... belong to the advance units of the United States 7 th Fleet . [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Cheering Continues ] - Stay with me . - For a time . - For always . - Oh , well , now , that 's a very long time . I mean it . I want to be with you . You are with me , boy . No one has ever treated me like you do , John . If you can 't stay here , I 'll leave my throne , and I 'll go away with you . You will now , eh ? Well , what would you do ? Hunt for treasure ... " where the clouds ride upon the shoulders of the sea . " Well , one day you will . Come on now . They 're all waiting for you . You go and show them what a king should look like . I 'll be here ... whenever you need me . [ Gong Sounds ] [ Nelson ] And so it came to pass that in this far-offland ... a new king sat upon the scales while the lords of the kingdom matched his royal weight ... with much fine gold ... a measure of their true devotion . [ Coins Clattering ] [ Coins Rattling ] [ Rattling Continues ] Where did he go ? I don 't know . I think the king is wondering the same thing too . He looks like a lonely little boy , doesn 't he ? Your Majesty , we must finish the ceremony . You must accept the gifts . On behalf of my people , I accept . The ceremony is ended . Your lonely little boy suddenly looks very much like a king . [ Christmas Carol On Speakers ] This tree , gentlemen , was a gift from the king . - Chip . - Thank you , sir . - Something troubling you , Lee ? - Oh , no . I was , uh , just wondering about that man , John . Who was he ? Where do you suppose he came from ? I don 't know . It 's a curious thing . This is where we picked him up ... right near this island . - Christmas Island . - Yeah . Which reminds me , gentlemen . - Merry Christmas to all . - Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas .

 - Ok , Venus ? - Ok , Steve . Right . Come on . SPACE GHOST Fireball Jr para Prof. Matic . Cone do nariz desconectado . The path of Electon planet . All right , Steve . You do not have much time . Remember , we are far behind . I will not have time to introduce you to the people of Electon , Fraser . - But just need to say my name . - What kind of people are they ? Simple people , living in small communities across the globe . I think they are slightly delayed relative to the Earth . But they are certainly hospitable . I 'm sure I will get along with them , Colonel . I appreciate your stop here . The town is just across the hills . There 's not much but it 's comfortable here . Half homely and old-fashioned . Okay , Steve . Send your memories to electons . Let me see , I am with all my survival gear . Well , I think I 'm ready . Fireball XL5 to Jr , Fraser has landed , Matt . I 'm coming back . Gee , I hope the Fraser stay right here . Vai course , Venus . The electons is a really friendly people . Moreover Fraser is a typical geologist . This survey will keep you pretty busy . Hello . Someone here ? Hello ! I am the Earth . All right . I 'm friends . Hey , there 's something very strange . The place looks deserted . This place has not been used for weeks . And the meal , or was terminated . It seems that left here in a hurry . Someone must have been very scared . Who 's there ? Hey , look there , Fraser . You 're getting nervous . It was just the wind . The wind made the door slam . Now , let 's see . Where can I stay ? Steve said something about a hotel at the city gate . Well , I 'll try this first . Well , It is not the Ritz but I think it serves . I hope you have left enough food before they disappear . Wow , I 'm lucky . Soon it will be night . Well , I need to check the rooms . Continue patrol . I think Fraser may have settled now . It is night now in Electon planet . It could be , Steve . but I think people are giving Electon a party in his honor . Yeah , I think I 'll sleep right here . No ; This light . It looks like it 's coming from that stone . It is . Electric stone . Boy . Boy , that discovery . It must be so that light their homes . Well , I think I 'll eat something and lie down . I want to start early tomorrow . You should have more of these things around . Wow , it looks like it is full of these power stones there . Wow ... Gee , that would be worth a fortune on earth . And there 's tons of it here just waiting to be excavated . I ... I 'll start right now to get some samples . A month excavation resulted in a stack of these things . Ho , ho , I 'll be rich . I 'll get rich ! And I will not share with anyone . Ah , maybe Steve Zodiac want a piece to take me to Earth , but that 's it . The rest is mine . Ha , ha , ha ! All mine ! Hey ! Hey , I found a kind of explosive rock . I found some kind of explosive rock ! And boy , this will help me to dig more electric rock . Well , I 'll be able to work ten times faster . You are ready for the mission , Zenta ? We need to visit the planet to catch Electon our supply of electrical rocks . Do you think the people have returned to their cities ? If returned , We will be forced to use the same previous methods to get them out of there . But why not talk to the electons ? You 're too young , Zenta . Someday you may learn that we , the Groverianos we must accept our shyness . The electons are much larger than us . They can hurt us . And we have no weapons . Hallah is so wise . He must be right . Maybe when you 're older , I have the same wisdom . Rapidan , Senta . I 'm regulating the magnets that will pull us for the planet Electon . MAGNETIC CHARGER Let 's see how fast , Zenta ? All I need is to increase the power of the magnets na front gives ship and we are pulled by magnetism ahead of our destiny Now let 's collect a fresh supply of electrical rocks . then our planet may have lighting . Sim . Our people will thank us for providing light to their homes . Look at the pump ! What was this ? Why this seems an explosion ? I do not know . Let 's look carefully . It is not a Electon . He is from another planet . We are fortunate that our landing was quiet . He does not know we 're here . But see , he is also collecting electrical rocks . The reason we are here . We need to stop it . But how ? We will use the same methods we use to take the electons of your city . Let 's hope it effective . 80 days alone ! And now at last , I can see another earthling . The Fireball XL5 should arrive today . No ! Hey , assuming they are delayed , Oh ... Oh no . It can not be . It can not be . Orbiting the planet Eleton , Steve . Understood , Venus . We are ready to disconnect . Ok , Steve . Robert est√° no controle central . Disconnecting agora . Hey , what I 'm hearing ? It 's a spaceship ? I Hope I 'm not imagining it . A spaceship ? This means that most great men are coming . Sure . Alight , great people , but when we 're done with you , They will wish they had never seen Electon . Hello Fraser . How 's it going ? Hey , you look a little strange . There 's something wrong . Fraser , you 're sick . What happened ? Do not worry about it now , I 'm fine . But I made an amazing discovery . Electrical rocks . There are , right there . Now help me carry these rocks to his ship , We can take off immediately . Oh no . Wait , Fraser . We will not get that pile of rocks and bring to Earth . Mr. Never not arise from the ground . Well , not leaving here without them . This will give me a lot of money . I worked for three months to join it . I 'll give you part of the profits , Zodiac . Nobody needs to know that , just go to the Earth . Sorry . No , nothing done , Fraser . We take a sample of the piece , but that 's it . Ok . You have until tomorrow to think about it . But I notice , Zodiac I am a dealer . Steve , I am concerned about the Fraser . He is a sick man , all this time alone should have it strongly affected . He is suffering from a form of spatial melancholy . And this is serious , Venus ? Hard to say , Steve , but it may need special treatment . Yeah , but meanwhile it is with that idea in mind on these stones . He 's got rocks in his head , that is . You welcome . Zoonie is very restless , Seve . I think he feels someone outside . Oh , it must be wrong . This is a ghost town . Steve , do not say it . I 'm already scared enough . Soon we will go out to work . Zenta , we need to get things ready . Sim , Hallah . His plan is good . We expect it to work as it worked with electons . Now come , Zoonie . We are going to bed . Try to rest in this beautiful basket that Steve thought for you . Now come on , Zoonie . Do not be silly . Ah , let him , Venus . He lies down whenever you want . No . It will not . What 's going on with the covers ? What 's going on ? And this strange sound ? What is this ? Oh , I 'm scared . I 'll see what Steve . Steve , Steve . Are you sleeping ? Oh , oh . Venus ? What is wrong ? Strange things are happening in this house . I think ... I think she is haunted . Ah , Venus . You know what this is . You had a nightmare , that 's all . No , no , Steve . You do not understand . I was not dreaming . Oh , volte para a cama , Venus . You 're tired . Now go to sleep . Oh , maybe you 're right , Steve . Good evening . Yes , yes , good night , Venus . Oh well . I 've read enough tonight . Hey , what ? What ? What ? Well , er ... Something funny is going on here . I 'll talk to Steve . Where v is welcome this sound ? Steve ! - Ahn ? - Steve ! Acorde ! What is this ? What ? Agora , Steve , Steve . Ee-I think . That this hotel is haunted ! Oh no ... You too ? Venus came here with the same story . Now they can go back to bed and let me get some sleep ? Someone is prowling around here . Whatever it is He is coming down the stairs . I need to see . I 'll find out what 's going on . Oh , if only he was not so scared . I could not imagine it . The front door closing alone . But Steve never believe me . We look every bit of this place and found nothing . Only Fraser disappeared , Steve . Well , it 's night now . Let 's get dressed . Let 's find Fraser and talk to him about it all . Fraser ! Come on in Fireball Jr . You have ten minutes before takeoff Do not take another step ! You will not leave this world without lead My electrical rocks on board . Now , be reasonable , Fraser . Go down and go to the ship . Steve ! No , do not worry . I 'm Ok . I 'm just pretending . You and Matt pull me behind those rocks . So I took the Zodiac , huh ? It shows that I 'm not bluffing . Great . Now , keep him talking , Matt . I 'll try to catch him from behind . Can I use these rocks as cover . Ok , Steve . But be careful . These rocks are deadly explosive . Steve Zodiac 's really sick , Fraser He needs urgent care . First you carry my electric rocks , then you can take care of it . You can not do this , Fraser . Essa disarmament catapult . Come down and we can talk about it . We need to help Steve . Nothing done , Professor . Begin to charge my electric rocks . Now pay attention , Fraser . Be reasonable . You know we can not take those stones . Begins to move to the pile of rocks , Teacher , So we take care of the Zodiac . I could guess that would be up to something , Zodiac , crawling like that . Disarming the catapult or 'll shoot . If you do this , Zodiac , I break down these explosive gems and will be the end of us all . Now release this ray gun . Ok , Fraser . I think you 're setting the tone . I do not think like you , Zodiac . I think I 'll take care of you anyway . You do not know what you 're doing . Salve-se Zodiac . Me salve , Zodiac ! A ship ! MAGNETIC CHARGER We help one called Zodiac because he tried to save electrical rocks . I do not know who they are , but I would like to thank . I , er , I 'll take Fraser for FIrebal Jr while he is off . Ok , Matt . Meanwhile perhaps you can tell me what this is all about . We come from Grovans planet , the next planet Electon . You did astonished the electons of your city ? It is correct . See , we are a shy people . We think the electons not let us pick up the electrical Rocks . But electons are friendly . Only need ask to pick up some rocks . That would be enough for you . But what the shipping costs ? This is easy for us . We live next planet and use magnets as transportation . Our magnets can do almost anything . They noticed something strange last night ? Oh , sure . The haunted house business . So that 's that creepy armed act ? All with the magnets , is not it ? Yes , I 'll show you . It 's important to find the electons and apologize . They are elsewhere in the world ? Sim . Now that we are not afraid of them , let 's talk . Well , it will not be long before this place is full of people happy again , Venus . Yes Steve . Hallah and Zenta were seeking the electons . Sorry we can not wait for the return them , but duty calls . This is the Space Patrol for you , always in motion . Venus Come , Come on . Translation - Neverlost

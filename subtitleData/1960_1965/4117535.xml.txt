 Attention ! This is Radio Moscow ! This is Radio Moscow ! All broadcasting radio stations of the Soviet Union are on . Here 's an official announcement from the " Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union " . Three Soviet Cosmic Expedition Starships ... Sirius , Vega and Cappella ... have spanned the distance of over two hundred million kilometres and are safely approaching Venus ! The astronauts are in perfect health ! Having gone all that distance to be caught like that on the last lap , near Venus ... We 're still helpless against large meteorites . But we were ready to run risks . I can hardly believe it ! I 've just been talking and making jokes with them . - This is Earth ! Let me answer . - Go ahead . 'Sirius " , Vega ... we are shocked with the loss of Cappella We believe in your determination . Put the spaceships into the satellite orbit . Specify the conditions on the planet . What are your suggestions ? Arktur will be ready for launch in a week 's time . It 'll take Arktur four months to get here . - Just waiting without landing is a torture . - But you know the plan . One ship , carrying the fuel , was to remain in the orbit . The other two were supposed to land , to back up each other . Therefore , until Arktur has arrived , landing is impossible . Impossible for spacecrafts , but not for people . What do you mean to say ? - Ilya Vassilievych , according to one of the variants , Vega 's soaring glider can land . - Yes , with Allan Kern 's universal robot on board . To hell with the robot ! Let me land the glider . - It 's a one-way journey , Alexey ! - I know . I 'll be waiting for Arktur down there working and transmitting the data by radio . I 'm sure I can do more than ... this piece of metal . Venus should be seen with human eyes , not with photocells . What if something happens to you there ? I promise not to call for help . I 'll sign a promissory letter for you . My life belongs to me . Mister Kern ! - Yes ? - I need to have a word with you . Just a moment . I 'll only be half a minute . I can 't believe they are no more . They were lucky . An instantaneous death is better . - Mister Kern ! - I 'm all ears , sir . Instead of your robot , Alexey wants to land the glider on Venus . How come , a Sirius crew member would man the Vegas glider ? I hope we understand each other . - What are you talking about ? - What about ? Well , nothing ... Alexey is right - the last sacrifice is better than idling in the outer space ... waiting for a meteorite to squash you . Like them . - What are you up to , Ivan ? - Yes , yes . Or the sun may suddenly give a flash and kill us with radiation . - The Earth won 't permit the landing . - It must ! - We should land without waiting for Arktur to arrive . - Let 's figure it out ... - ... the danger factor being neglected . - It 's crazy ! Running risks is a normal thing in the outer space . - Okay ! - Make calculations ! If you wish , make use of your new invention . - Okay ! " General Cybernetics " has been long awaiting a real job . Listen ! At such a moment . Seven , twelve , nine ... Hallo , John ! Wake up ! - Yes , Sir ? - Please . dear John . Give us the best possible variant of a landing with a safe return , ... with only Vega and Sirius available . Including yourself , we 're seven now . Neglect the danger factor . Vega remains in the orbit . The glider of Vega seats three people , Sirius takes three . So , altogether six are to land . On the way back , Sirius can lift up five . The sixth is to stay on Venus . - Who 's the sixth ? - It 's me , sir . As the dead and the heaviest one . Mathematics are ruthless . - It 's a poor variant . - Negative . It 's good for business , but hazardous for us , therefore it hasn 't been in our plans . One thing is not clear though - who 's staying in the orbit ? According to this variant , I 'm the only one who can stay . To process all the information from the planet and transmit it to Earth . - I 'm the only one who can do it . - Listen , Masha ! Excuse me . It 's silly , perhaps , But I 've always hoped for other variants . I 've been working for so many years , trying my best . It ' been so hard : the satellite , then the Moon , ... you do know , don 't you ? ... - I wanted to do it together . - So what do you suggest ? I don 't know . Masha , Kern and his robot , ... they were recommended by the International Association . You know it 'll be a test for a whole field of research in cosmonautics . - But I ... I need to be on Venus . - As if I don 't ... An alien world . How many times we 've been sending probes here these years . With their help we 've studied the atmosphere , discovered the oceans and continents ... and measured the temperatures . Thousands of figures . But robots can 't answer the biggest question - ... if there is Life . Who is there ? Now , at last , to get this question answered Man himself has come ! Get the beacon ready for launch . The pressure on the surface is two and three . The height of the clouds is 15 . There are dust clouds above the shore ... and another source of carbon dioxide . Some light-red spot can be seen through the clouds . Thousands of new data but none about the main thing . And the main thing is ... . - who is there ? - There 's nobody . No living thing has evolved there as yet . But perhaps this reddish spot is ... a city flooded with lights ? It 's a dead planet , extinct . Here intelligence has already destroyed itself . Who 's right then ? ! Nay , ... no robots can substitute for a man . Hello , Sirius ? Ilya Vassilievich ? Yes ? In the prospective landing district I don 't see a single plane site for Sirius to land . - Too rough , true . - Shall we change the landing district ? Negative . The order is to land here . - I have a suggestion . - Yes ? We don 't need Arktur . From a 1000 meter altitude the glider will find a good spot for your Sirius to land . - Which can 't be seen from here . - If it fails to find one ? - Pensions to the families and monuments to the heroes . - You mean the glider crew ? It 's me , Kern , and the root . Masha stays in the orbit . We 'll dump the robot on Venus . - You seem to have figured everything out ? - Sure . What shall we answer ? I wish I could be with them . Adventurous . Listen , prepare a report for the headquarters . ... and a well - grounded one . Perhaps , they 'll permit it . - Ready ? - Yes ! Then go ahead . I envy you , Shcherba ! And you , Allan Kern ! I understand you , Commander . - Good luck to you ! - Bon voyage , my friends . Bye ! They 're approaching it ! Black clouds , a lightning ! Put John in charge of the controls . A steep rock ahead , I go upwards . Wow ! Well done , devil 's dummy ! Clouds on the ground . We 're tracking them with the locator . Not too good , as yet . Here it is ! A smooth little spot in the hollow . Solid ground , good ! That 'll do . This is quadrant seventy three . We 'll drop our beacon here . You should land three hundred meters south-west of the beacon . We 're blown away . There 's water under us . We can only land on the swamp . Rocks sticking out . Crash chances are 90 per cent . I come in to land . Ilyia Vassilievych ? Masha , calm down . They 're just screened off by the horizon . They 've landed . We 'll contact them in an hour , on the next turn . Shcherba , hallo ! Kern , hallo ! Shcherba , Kern , hallo ! The situation looks bad . Well , get ready . We 're going to land now . The atmosphere is calmer at night . Quadrant 73 . - Masha ? - I 'm here . Masha , we come in to land . You 're staying alone in the outer space . Mashenka , my dear . Track us on the locator . - But you know what to do . - I do . Listen , Masha . If we die - ... - don 't lose your head . - Message acknowledged . - May I cut off communication ? - You may , my girl . It 's the hardest on the one who 's alone . - Earth . - The mission headquarters allows you to interrupt the expedition any moment . Your people , that 's most important . We wish you a success ! Your country is with you . Hallo , Earth ! Headquarters ! We 're landing in the charted district . The landing field has been chosen from the glider . Quadrant 73 . We promise to the Soviet government ... to our country , ... and all the Soviet nation ... that we 'll do our best to justify your trust . Hallo . If something happens , take care of Ivanova , she 's alone . - That 's it , Ilya . It 's time . Take the aerial away . - Ready . Switching on the automatic . Guided by the beacon and 300 meters south-west . Is it really Venus ? ! Quadrant 73 . - Wow ! I 'm starting to feel my weight . - We 've grown out of the habit of gravitation .. The ship shows no setting . The ground is solid . Well done , scouts ! She 's standing firm , old girl . Just like on Earth . - I 'm lifting up the blinds . - Go ahead ! Give me some light . Roman . No use , thick fog 's all around . Let 's check around with locators . There 's a rock here , two hundred meters off . I see some junk in this sector . Another rock . - I 'll turn on the outer mikes . - Come on . - Did you hear that ? - Yes . - What could it be ? - Be quiet . Well , enough . No time to waste . Roman , switch on the infra-red radar . - I 'll get it recorded . - Sure , we 'll send it over to Earth . Switch on the weather station and bio-locator , the seismic probe also . In a word , act according to Program 1 . - When Masha appears above the horizon , tell her , we 've touched down . - I 'll tell her a tall story . Save your boasting till later , when we 've saved our people . - Starting out when it gets light ? - Yes , at six . I 'm standing ! Let me try a few steps ? - Careful ! Try the ground with the probe ! - Okay . A stone as a stone ... Water as water ... Somewhat unbelievable ! Alexey ! - You 'd better come back ! - Just a moment . Oh ! Ilya Vassilievich ! - What 's up ? - Masha has spotted the glider . - Are they alive ? - She 's spotted two metal objects next to each other . One is motionless , the other 's moving . Must be the robot . - Keeping silence ? - They are . Their radio might have broken down . Alexey ! - Get up ! - It 's holding me . No panic ! - Are you okay ? - No worries , Alexey ! - I 'm all right ! - The spacesuit is intact . Let me take a picture of hi m . There Is Life ! Here 's the answer to the principal question . Haste makes waste , guy . You 're lucky we 've come in good time . - But how did you guess ? - We heard a scream . - So did I. - Strange . This is Venus , my friends . - What else did Masha say ? - What else to say ? I feared for you so much . And I 'm so happy now , as I 've never been before . Masha , we 're interested in the details . Excuse me , I 've just lost my head . They 're in quadrant 107 , ... beyond the red spot . Directly across the gulf , ... it 's 32 kilometres from you . Understood . - Get our all-terrain vehicle ready . - 32 kilometres to go ? - Quite a distance for the vehicle . - What do you suggest ? - Never land gliders on Venus . - We 'll think of it . Come on , quick . - Ilya Vassilievich ? - But are they alive ? Masha ! Masha , don 't you think that the robot could have started up on its own ? No . I understand you . No , no . No , ' cause we loaded it disassembled , it had to be assembled there . Hold on now . Okay . Bloody bastards . - Quick ! - Hold them for just another minute . It hit you hard , John . A mighty blow . Okay ! The course is 10 . Make secure on the rock . Pull the rope tight . - Do as I say . - Yes sir . An ordinary man is incapable of conquering these wild worlds . - Steel men are more useful here . - A baby tank would 've been quite practical . A man is more beautiful . You 're the first to go . I 'll help you . - Shall we stop ? - We have to get our bearings . Ilya Vassilievych , here 's another one . Looks like a brontosaur . I 'll take a blood test . - From the tail . Do you hear ? - All right . Careful ! Done , and the temperature 's measured . He 's a bit slow on the uptake . What 's new from Masha ? The robot is moving to meet us , but he 's very slow . - Don 't push on . - The oxygen will last us just 24 hours . They must be looking for us , coming to meet us . Through this hell ? No to fear and be selfish is human . Friendship is human . We 're getting sick - it must be a fever . You bet , some bug has gone through . The spacesuits are all torn . - Let 's take " Quininicilline " . - No , we 'll need a lie-down after taking it . No time , the fever will be over by itself . Let 's go ! - How far is that shore ? - It 's 10 across the Bobrov gulf . And 70 roundabout . Take care of this gulf on your own . - Do you hear it ? - Let 's stop . The same voice again . Reptiles are more than enough here . Some ugly cuttlefish . - I think it 's a human being . - Oh well , a woman , perhaps ? I wish it were . - I wish Darwin were here . - Darwin has nothing to do with it . - But how could a man appear during the epoch of the prehistoric pangolins ? - We could , couldn 't we ? We have flown in here . Roman , but Alexey is right . Man , as a developed , mature being , is a flying creature , .. ... in the cosmic sense of the word . - You 're on to it again ! - But of course ! Darwin only explains how an intelligent creature originally evolved from the animal kingdom but man 's subsequent interplanetary proliferation , ... rather refers to Tsiolkovsky , than to Darwin . How can the Academy of Science tolerate professor Vershinin ? We 're the first to come from Earth but others might have come here before us . - Who knows ? - All right . All aboard ! Too much water from above . My mechanisms are endangered . A roof is needed . John , look for a cave . Please . Yes . Sir . - I can 't stand much more of that . - Pull yourself together ! We can 't stay here . We 'll be washed away like kittens . Come along ! Careful . Hold on ! Just don 't give in ! John ! Yes , sir ? I 'm in a cave . Luminosity is 3.2 lux . You are a good mathematician , John . I seem to be loosing my mind . According to the laws of math . the world government will rule the world . The world government , the world profit , the world science . No , Masha ! They won 't go past us . - Sirius ... - It will take us thirty seven and two tenths of a minute ... to reach Sirius by automobile on a concrete highway . - Ilya ? - Yes ? - Bad news from Masha - the robot has disappeared . - From bad to worse . Check it out , perhaps , you 'll hear their interphone headsets . - We must 've come quite near them . - I 'll try to . Got it . It 's their robot . He 's talking some gibberish . Just listen ! The cost of building a highway to Sirius is 57 million dollars , at the " Smith " company 's rates . - It looks like the machine 's got out of hand . - I 'll try to contact them . Hallo ! Iron John ? Or what 's your name ? Do you hear me ? - No response , devil 's dummy . - Cool down , Roman . The robot only responds when addressed politely . What a sissy . Hallo , dear John . Please . Be so kind as to answer , please . Audibility is 46,5 % . Where 's Shcherba ? Where 's Kern ? Where are your masters ? Masters unknown . Slavery is forbidden by the Constitution . I 'm a free thinking machine . Inform us on the position of your co-travellers . Position horizontal . - Where are you now ? - Under a stone vault . - I see - they 're in a cave . - Therefore Masha couldn 't have located them . Hallo , dear John ! What are you companions talking about ? About Masha and the world government which I 'm to head as prime-minister . - They must be raving . - A fever and , perhaps , a seal failure . - Too bad , we have to act urgently . Take the controls . - Yes ! Hallo , listen carefully , John ! Take " Quininocilline " from out your first-aid kit . " Quininocilline " . Test-tube number 2 . It 's nine fifteen . I 've transmitted to Earth all the data collected by Sirius . It 's one thirty : I passed over the all-terrain vehicle it was entering the sea . Something 's approaching in the air , from behind on the right . - What does the infra-visor show ? - Some changeable shapes . Sort of quite dense . Look ! - Resembles a pterodactyl . - Shut your helmets . No kidding with this dragon . - Here 's an awesome boy ! - Hell ! - Did you managed to take a shot ? - Yes , both a photo and a film .. - Then shoot him with a cannon . Aim at his jaws . - There 's a jam ! Do it manually and open up the hood . Some flying animals are attacking . A strong blow ! Inform the Earth ... Hallo . What 's the matter ? Hallo ? What is your message ? - Ready ? - Ready . Have a go . What 's happened ? The vehicle is not designed for submersion . Does it mean a catastrophe ? What 's wrong with them ? If their spacesuits are intact , they 'll be all right . They may be wounded ! I must save them . But if I land , there 's no return to Earth . And yet , I should land . I can do it during the next turn . In an hour , I 'll start up the engines . A whole hour 's wait ! I must think it over . Earth ! Millions of people have been working ... to build up this pyramid as high as the skies . We 've been put on its top , . entrusted with everything , and now the outcome depends on me alone . And I don 't know what to do ! Under the instruction orders I shouldn 't leave the orbit . If I land , there is no way back to Earth . But does it make any sense to save fuel , ... if people die ? The instruction couldn 't have foreseen everything but my heart tells me that I 'm more needed at the Planet . I must inform the Earth . It 's so hard to speak calmly . Let them listen to my last recordings . The instruction couldn 't foresee everything . ... but my heart tells me Hallo , Vega ! Masha Ivanova ! Earth is with you . Take yourself in hand . Wait for them ! Whatever happens , stay in the orbit , or everything will be ruined . Be firm . The Earth is asking you . Your Earth ! My ... Earth ! Await them in the orbit . Otherwise all will be ruined ! What is to be done ? Time 's running out . I must take a decision . And I ... I just can 't . Sinking the vehicle was by far easier than pulling it out . Yes , the resistance is quite strong . Let 's take a short break . Interesting boulders . I 'll go look . They ' like those on Earth . The environments are similar . I wonder if nature could create such regular rows of rocks ? Like streets . What if it 's a drowned city ? That would be great ! You scared me ! An entrance ? ! That 's interesting . I hope the house owners aren 't in . A strange stone , a triangular projection . I 'd rather take it . - Take a look ! - What is it ? A petrified dragon . But , perhaps , it 's made of stone ? Man-made ? You bet ! ? Take a look ! It 's an eye ! - A ruby . - Mounted by an intelligent creature ! Give me the buoy . So what do you say , Professor ? It 's volcanic spongy iron . - It gets oxidized to steal the oxygen from the atmosphere . - So what ? Man can change it . - And then ... - Do you wish to facilitate colonization and get the Nobel prize ? Why , no ! It will do for people as it is . We can go , sir . John , give us your song . Our favourite ! - Ilya ! - Yes ? We 'll have to wait awhile for the vehicle to dry out . Nothing doing . Ilya , but the ruby-eyed dragon is a bit crude made by a savage . - Very likely . But savages couldn 't have flown up to Venus , could they ! Why not ? Engineer Bobrov , for example , he could ! Shut up . Savages couldn 't have flown up here . But they could 've appeared here in situ . - How come ? - Just imagine that once upon a time some highly civilized creatures came here . And for some reason or other , they got stuck , ... Lost all contact with their mother planet . They were to perish . They ran out of their reserves , . the nature and atmosphere being alien and hostile . - Didn 't I say they 'd die ? . - Some could survive . ... but would grow wild . Because the beastly fight for survival would take toll of thousands of their generations .. Until their bodies could adjust to the local conditions . What culture to speak of ! Just the survival of the fittest . - And a savage would appear amidst the pangolins ? - Exactly . Without waiting for the local ape to evolve . The future master of the planet would appear and start growing . - Again ? - Sounds like a warning . We are near the red spot now . - Is the canon in working order ? - It is . All that is so weird . A buried city and that ruby and this voice . Who could have flown in here ? Inhabitants from some other planetary system ? The Martians , perhaps ? On Mars one has to fight for every drop of water . While the ocean engulfs the land here . Perhaps they tried to move here , but with little success ? Became wild ? And now that they 've taken root , they 're reattempting to climb up to the summit of civilization ? Perhaps , Martians visited the Earth also ? What if we - contemporary people ... . We can go . I 'll find her all the same ! - It 's too dark for this time of day . - It should be . - Why ? - There 's a cloud of dust above us . A cloud of dust ? ! - An eruption ? - Yes . The red spot . I was right , here 's a city lit with lights for you ! - The timing is a bit wrong . - On the contrary . We can take fresh lava samples , ashes and gases - Is your spectroscope all right ? - It is . We 'd rather find some elevated place , father from here . - Let 's get going . Hurry up ! - Sorry to leave . What a splendid view ! - Mister Shcherba ! - Yes ? The lava is surrounding us . - Did you record the spectrum ? - Yes . - And at the crater ? - No . - Couldn 't do it ? - I was short of time . - John ! - Yes , sir ? Carry us across the lava stream . Climb up , quick ! - Audibility is getting better . - Who 's that he 's sensed there ? - Keep quiet . - Here 's our radio bearing . As you require , I measure the distance ... . ... it 's two miles . - But these must be our people ! - Most likely , they are . And you didn 't believe me . - You machine is truly great ! - Yes ? - It is . - At last you have admitted it . My feet are heated up to 500 degrees . Moving further with the load is hazardous for my mechanisms . - What does it mean ? - We have to switch off his self-protection program . - Where is it ? - Open the door . The fifth panel . See the wire ? Do you ? ! - But I have no idea where it is . - Let me do it . How should I do it ? - I can 't see it from here . - I have to free myself from the load , gentlemen . Damn idiot ! - He 's dumping them into the lava . - Hurry ! Get out . - Are you okay , Kern ? - Hallo , Kern ! So which people are of more use - made of steel or of flesh and bones ? Looks like both are useful . - That 's better . - Maybe . Let 's go . How 's the radio ? - Where 's she now ? - Crossing the zenith . There 's no radio . What sort of stocktaking is that ? They didn 't have time to give a name while I was there . Poorly calculated , mathematician . Daughters ? - Sons . - A complete crew . Do you really believe that the Earth was visited in the past ? There are no evident traces though . Those numerous , so called , mysteries of history . - I consider the traces . - And they are common knowledge . - What about a stone age rock painting in Sahara ? - Quite right . This drawing shows a man wearing a space suit ! What about those ancient rust-resisting columns in India ? The way they treated the iron of the columns is yet unparalleled on Earth .. And the mystery of the Atlantis ? And the extraordinary knowledge of the ancient astronomers ? - And what not , you name it . - These facts prove nothing . One can look for the traces in the legends . Like , for instance Gods descending from the heavens . - It 's too much ! - Why not ? How will a local savage picture you ? As a saint , with a halo around your head . His story will be as follows : - " a boat descended from the heavens and God , clad in fur skins , stepped out of it ... - Here 's the text of a local legend for you . - With illustrations . I 'm convinced that interstellar flights - are an inevitable step for development of life elsewhere . There 's no isolation between the worlds . And Life immigrating in cosmos is as natural as spreading the plants seeds by the wind on Earth . And perhaps , the Solar system planets are populated with one and common tribe of living creatures , who are developing like different branches ? Of the Solar tribe . Then all the relatives are expected to be intelligent creatures . I wish I could see her . What is she like ? That would make it all clear . For you , take it . It 's for your " mathematician " ! The planet of storms , thank you for what you 've taught us . Thanks for the shelter , here 's our earthly bow to you . Our ship is waiting , and we 're heading home . Our hearts are beating " homeward , homeward ! " Homeward , guys ! We 'll count again the compass cosmic points . Stand at the helm , with valour in our hearts . The seas and fields and woods await us there In our dear land , our homeland , our Earth , guys ! Your cuttlefish woman must be happy that you 're safe and sound . - She 's no cuttlefish at all . She 's wise , kind and beautiful . - We 'll start hunting her tomorrow . He 's obsessed . Listen , lover boy ! If this woman is a savage Martian , where are the rest of them ? If you landed on Earth , somewhere in wild mountains , would you meet a lot of people ? - Within two days ? - I 'd meet some recluse , perhaps . - Or his daughter . - At the best . The rest would be there , beyond the mountains . There 's no telephone here yet . Well , that 's about it . Comrades , I think we 've carried out the program . We 've collected a lot of materials ! The most valuable things - cassettes , chart recorders and micro preparations - are for you . The stones go to the geologist . - Alexey ! - Yes ? - Let 's go to the radio . - All right . - Be quick ! - What 's up ? Hurry up ! It 's Masha 's broadcast recording from Vega . " I hope the Sirius monitors will record my radiogram . I was instructed to stay in the orbit . To wait and do nothing , while my friends are , perhaps , agonizing calling for me and waiting for me . I violate the instruction . I 'm going to land on Venus . The controls needle is already in motion . In a minute the engines will start up . - How could she ? - She didn 't grasp the situation . A robot can grasp a situation , not a woman . God save my soul ! - She 's not in the sky . - But she 's scheduled to be here . - Hallo ! Vega ! - Vega could have crashed . ... or sunk . - We have to inform the Earth . - But used to contact only via Vega . Comrades ! I suggest that Shcherba Kern and Alexey should stay here , and put up a camp . Roman and I will fly up to the orbit . From there we 'll find Vega and instruct you . - We 'll transmit all the expedition results to Earth . And we 'll call for Arktur . - Right . - If you agree , we should disembark the camp equipment . - It should be done , anyway . To lighten Sirius . What 's that now ? - An Earthquake ! - The rocket gave in . The precipice is being washed away ! The mountain lake broke out . Look ! A crack ! If Sirius collapses , it will be the end of us . Get ready for take-off . Hope we 'll make it . The radio station should go there . Aside ! Roman , when was Masha 's last broadcast recorded ? - At 7.20 . Why ? - You know the locator indicates that Vega has passed above us , after she sent that message of hers . - What ? - She didn 't land . - Hallo , Masha ! Are you okay ? - What happened ? I realized I was making a mistake . I overcame myself and shut off the engines in good time . But the orbit 's changed . Then I located you near the red spot . I was tracking you , but you didn 't respond . - Now they have no need to stay here . - Sure . Hallo ! Give the parameters of your new orbit . And quick ! Hallo ! All on board . What does it mean ? Dear Masha ! - Alexey ! Switch on the meteorological station . - Done . Alexey , hurry up ! Ilyia Vassilievyc ! Wait up ! We can 't fly away . They are like us ! Understand ? Take a look ! They are like us . They look like us . You understand ? Wait ! Why are you dragging me ? I 'm telling you they 're like us . Planet of storms , see you soon . Soon you will see again our ships from Earth We are her sons and we shall prove our worth ! We 're the sons of Earth , guys !

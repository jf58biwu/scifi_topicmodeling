 - Ok , Venus ? - Ok , Steve . Right . Come on . MYSTERY TA 2 Hey , why the delay to calculate the course , Professor ? You do not want to go home ? Sorry Steve , was receiving a weak signal in Astroscópio . - Any idea what it is ? - No . I can not understand . - There is nothing in the visual . - Must be another spacecraft . Oh , do not go , Steve . Whatever you are drifting . Okay , forget the course for Earth . Let 's take a look . Standing order to face . Switch to stationary , Robert . Switch to stationary . It seems some kind of wreck , Steve We met in ejection room . Let 's investigate . Whatever it may be , it came from Earth . Part of an old spaceship , I would say . But we will never identify with this . It has a label type . It might help . Can you get it , Steve ? Yes , yes , I have succeeded . I can hardly read . Good . That should give us a clue . Now let 's turn to the Fireball . Well , according to this , this label has the serial number Neutroni a radio installed in the TA2 . A TA2 ? What is it , Professor ? It is a very old patrol vehicle with a driver . He disappeared and was never found . He disappeared for many years , was not , Matt ? 48 , to be precise . Colonel Harry Denton , the pilot , was never seen again . I wonder what happened to him . We will never have the answer to that , Venus . Well , you may be wrong , Steve . I 've been studying this piece of wreckage to find , and I think I can figure out where the rest of the ship can be . Calculating the explosion of strength and G of the other planets . Assuming you 're still in one piece , Professor . Indeed , Steve . But I still think it 's worth taking a look . Of course Steve , I agree with Matt . I 'm sure that with . Zero does not care that investigate . It is outside the area of ​ ​ space patrol . It would be an achievement if we could resolve the mystery of TA2 , Steve . I agree that we have something here . Ok , calcule o curso , Matt . I 'll talk to Space City and say we 'll take a while . So XL5 will be late to come home , right ? That 's the message I received , Mr. Well , they better have a good reason for this . Wreckage ahead . The Matt calculations are very good . There she is . Or what 's left of it . And now , Steve ? Let 's all the space wreckage and see what we find . We can enter here Venus , but be careful . Use their jets to move . No artificial gravity here . Say , Steve , this must be the cockpit . Steve , there 's someone here ! Calm Venus , will open . I should have guessed . It was Matt and another of his tricks dummies . Steve ! He took off his jets . We need to save it . Oh , Professor , Professor ... Oh ! Oh , puxa ... Thank you Steve . I guess I should not have taken my jets . You can say that again . You found something , Venus ? There is nothing to indicate the fate of Colonel Denton . Maybe he made it out before the ship explodes . Venus doubt . There was no oxygen pills in those days . No , but there was the old spacesuits . I had air in them . By the way , I found the letters of the spacecraft . Maybe they tell us something . Good . Let 's get it when we get back to Fireball . Very interesting . What does all this mean ? Well , I found out what happened . One of atomic engines exploded . The fire must have spread later . You mean Col. Denton may have had time to leave ? Perhaps . Even if you have ejected you can not know where he went . Well , Colonel Denton should have tried to go for the planet ArcTan to eject . It is . You can see where he scored in the letter . I suppose he hoped someone found him rescued him . This happened almost 50 years ago , Steve . Perhaps , but let 's take a look . It is quite possible that he 's still alive . Right Steve . I will prepare the polar equipment . We 'll need . The arctan planet is frozen , and completely covered with snow . Se o Cel Denton se dirigiu para cá , Steve , I do not think it had much chance of surviving . So it would seem . But we must make sure . Let 's spread out and cover more area . We meet here in an hour , okay ? - Ok . _ Entendido . Oh , my . Time flies . I need to get back to Matthew and Steve Oh , damn ... No message from Colonel Zodiac , Mr. - So call him again , Ten . - Yes , Mr. Hello everybody . Hello everybody . Space City chamando Fireball XL5 . Hello everybody . - Well Lieutenant . - I did contact Mr. But they are not responding . They will answer to me . Here is the Zero Commander for XL5 . I 'm waiting for the report . Hello everybody . It is the Zoonie , Mr. I know that . You think I 'm a fool or something ? It must have been left alone and called the button in any way . Continue calling them , Lieutenant . Discipline . That 's what it takes . Nothing here , Steve . Any luck ? Nothing . It does not seem that Colonel Denton was on this planet . Well , even if it has been , I do not see how to survive in this climate . - You talked to Venus ? - No , Matt . I 'll call her . - Let me know later . - Understood . Venus , Steve here . R u OK ? Venus , are you listening ? Venus , Steve here . R u OK ? Venus , are you listening ? Help ! Steve ! Matt ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Steve ! Matt ! Venus does not respond to radio . I 'm worried , Matt . You 'd better go look for her , Steve . Help ! She must have seen something and went to investigate . I hope not , Matt . Look at these cracks . Matt , look ! Matt , his footprints are directed here . Ve-ee-Venus ! Ola-of-the-in Let 's go down , Matt . It 's getting much warmer . Yeah , I noticed it , Steve . I can listen something also . Espere , Matt . Some kind of hot jet . Steve , if Venus fell here ... We do not know if she did it . Let 's go up . Matt , there 's a kind of opening . This heat must ice has melted . It is worth taking a look . What ... What is it , Steve ? I do not know ... That 's ... Welcome ... Calling XL5 . This has gone far enough . Hello everybody . I want to see Colonel Zodiac soon as he arrives . Sim , Sr. Venus . What happened ? I ... I do not know , Steve . The last thing to remember is to have fallen into the slot , then ... Silence ! You are our prisoners of the earth people . We know that you came to steal our King of us . - Hey , you are mistaken . - Silence ! The ice booms will tell us whether they are guilty . Let 's heat up the roof of the cave , Earthlings . Some spears will break and fall . If they are guilty , Spears will take revenge for his crimes . You will die . What are they talking about , Steve ? Steal their king \ ? We 'll worry about that later , Venus , if we try . This ice is melting fast . I do not think like that kind of judgment . Steve ! I will be found guilty . It has a well over my head . As this trial will last ? A few minutes are more than enough for me . Release them immediately ! But Your Majesty ! Do not argue , Together . Take them to my palace . You can see what 's going on , Steve ? Their king arrived , luckily . Lucky for you . Boy ! I was guilty ! Please come . How did you come to this planet ? I am sure if you are the TA2 Denton ? You would be right . I mean ... I mean this is Colonel Denton , Steve ? Yes , young lady . I 'm me . But you 're 50 years late , my friends . Earlier I 'd give anything to see someone from Earth . But now ... now I have built a new life . And I 'm happy here . So I refuse to return to Earth ? This is my home now . It 's that ... this is my people . 50 years is a very long time to be away . I do not get used more to Earth . I 'm too old to change . I think his people put away the fears them . They need me , Steve Zodiac . And I need to be . Thank you very much ... but it is my decision . Now you are my guests . Let 's eat and talk . There is much I want to know from the earth before departing . Adeus , Steve Zodiac . You 'll never know how much I wanted to go to Earth with you . But my people ... they are like children . And I could never leave them . Ok , Ok , so you have solved the mystery of the TA2 . But this does not give them the right to have animals in space . It is against all the rules ! And from now on , you will have to stay with them . But Commander ... Sem " mas " Coronel ! From now on this Lazoon ... Hello everybody ! Ah , look at Steve , I admit he 's cute ... But , well , you see , here is the Space Patrol ... Well , what I 'm trying to say is ... You welcome ! This is what we 're trying to say , Commander ? It is . That 's what I 'm saying . Welcome , Venus , Steve , Professor . And the same to you , Zoonie . You welcome . You welcome ! You welcome !

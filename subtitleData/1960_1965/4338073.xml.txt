 [ Man ] General ? Plane approaching , sir . Altitude 34,000 feet ; range , 40 miles . Every day at this time , a U-2 spy plane . I wonder what they 're looking for . - Not , I am sure , what they 're going to get . - [ Laughs ] Major Amadi , do the honors . Oscillator vertical . [ Switches Clicking ] Widen beam . And activate . [ Man ] Activated and ready , sir . Switch on . Altitude 34,000 feet ; range , 30 miles . Gentlemen , today we face a moment of historic importance . With this final demonstration of the power of my new weapon ... I 'll be ready to act . Our country will command the Red Sea and the approaches to the Suez Canal . In a few short weeks , our country will have emerged ... as the greatest power in the Middle East . And will have started World War III . Without you , General Gamal , this plan will fail ... and it must fail . Your guns are useless , gentlemen . You 're surrounded by a highly potent magnetized field ... in which no machinery based on steel will move . - [ Grunting ] - Oh ! [ Gunshots ] Take him away ! Range , nine miles . Altitude , 30,000 ; range , 0 . Twenty-five thousand . Twenty thousand . Fifteen thousand . Five thousand . Three thousand . One thousand . [ Man ] Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea . Starring Richard Basehart ... David Hedison . Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea . Remember , Lee , when you contact Richmond he 'll put you in touch with the underground . Don 't take any unnecessary chances , but try to find out what 's happening with our U-2 's . - What if Richmond isn 't on the beach ? - Then hightail it back here fast . In any case , we will pick you up in four hours . - Yes , sir . I understand . - Captain ? Want another look at Richmond ? I don 't need it . By this time I could pick him out of a crowd . [ Curley On Speaker ] Captain , we 're 8,000 yards off Ras Kandara . Very well . Come to 4,000 and surface . Total blackout . No running lights . Scanning and detection reports , sir . - Still nothing ? - No rockets , no intercept missiles , no planes . - Still , we keep on losing U-2 's . - We 'd better get that landing boat ready . - Well , let 's hope I come back with something . - Good luck . So , the Seaview is still in the Red Sea area ? Investigating the U-2 crashes , sir . This could upset the entire timetable . I fail to see how , sir . The Magnus beam is invulnerable to attack here in these caverns . The only entrance by sea is far too deep . No submarine could enter . This one can . Major Amadi ... I charge you with full responsibility to deal with this American submarine . And will you also give me a free hand to act in any way I see fit ? You have it . Then it will be dealt with . - Will you be okay , Skipper ? - Yeah . You better not hang around here . - I 'll meet you at this spot at 0300 . - Yes , sir . - Good luck , Captain . - Thanks . Shove off . Put the gun away , Captain . - I 'm Jerry Richmond . - Show yourself . - I just wanted to be sure . - It 's about an hour into town . Let 's get started . Hey , wait a minute . Do you have identity papers for me ? Best we could get in the time we had . Do you know how to get into Ras Kandara from here ? Sure . I memorized the maps , but I thought you were gonna guide me . Only as far as the main road . I 've got a feeling they 're onto me . If they are , it wouldn 't be a good idea to go into town together . - I understand . - Now you 'll be all right . I 'll get you onto the highway . Once in town , find a nightclub called the Golden Parrot . - Golden Parrot . - Ask for a singer named ... [ Gunshot ] - Richmond ! Richmond ! - [ Groaning ] What singer ? What 's his name ? Golden ... Parrot . [ Gasps ] [ Grunts ] [ Gunshot ] [ Panting ] Thanks for the help . You can thank me later . Better get out of here before the police come . - Yeah . - No , this way ! Let 's go . Come on . You 're an American , huh ? Is it that obvious ? You will not last long here . The secret police swarms all over the city . But I will help you . Why should you ? Not all of us dislike Americans . Where were you going ? A nightclub called the Golden Parrot . I will take you there . Who do you want to see there ? - I don 't know . - [ Laughs ] It 's no matter . I 'll take you there anyway . Come . [ Door Closes ] Quick , up these stairs . Falazir . I trust we are in time . The bait is taken . Yeah , the fish will be ours , but only when we 're ready . [ Singing In French ] [ Ends ] [ Audience Applauding ] [ Orchestra Up-tempo ] [ Audience Laughing ] Luana ? My name 's Jerry Richmond . [ Audience Applauding ] Come with me . Where is Jerry Richmond ? He 's dead . We were ambushed on the beach . Then they know . Who are you ? I 'm an American . My name 's Lee Crane . Will you help me locate the underground ? I might ... if I could be sure who you are . What can I say ? They didn 't give me any secret password . And Jerry Richmond is dead ? Believe me , Luana , there isn 't much time . You 've got to trust me . Let us say I 'm willing to help . What would you want ? I 've got to find the location of a weapon , or whatever it is ... that 's knocking down our U-2 planes . Were you followed ? No , I don 't think so . We know what has been destroying your planes . It is buried in the cliffs along the coast . It uses some kind of magnetic force , or ... Very powerful . Mm , no wonder our detection instruments couldn 't spot anything . How can we reach it ? I don 't know . But there is a man who may be able to help you . I 'll try to get you to him . - Perhaps I can help you . - Amadi ! You were followed . But I know this man . He saved my life when I was attacked in the streets . I know him too . He 's General Gamal 's chief of security . A very difficult role for me . Sir , I have done you a favor . Now you owe me one . I want asylum on the submarine Seaview which brought you here . Now ... Now , wait a minute . How do you know all this ? You forget , my friend , I am the head of my country 's secret police . - Why should I trust you ? - All right . General Gamal is about to plunge my country into war . We cannot allow this . You have given us an opportunity to prevent it . Once on board the submarine , I will lead you to an underground entrance . Two carefully placed missiles will destroy the weapon , and with it , General Gamal 's power . Well , forget it . Even if I bought your story , I wouldn 't take you aboard the Seaview . You 've got to take him now . - Why ? - Don 't you understand ? If he 's lying , he can have his secret police on our heads the moment he steps outside . She 's right , you know ... if I 'm lying . But if I 'm not , I can help you to destroy this terrible weapon . It 's the only thing we can do now . Put him aboard the submarine and come back here . I will have set up the meeting with a man who can help you . I have presented you with a terrible dilemma , haven 't I ? [ Nelson ] Obviously , Major Amadi , your ... - your offer intrigues me . - Obviously . Do you know why Captain Crane decided to spend an extra day on shore ? No , sir . No , the captain did not confide in me . I see . Patterson . - I want you to keep a very close watch on our guest . - Right , sir . I hope this doesn 't offend you , Major , but we have to take certain precautions . Naturally , Admiral . I don 't think you 'll be quite so suspicious ... when I have given you the information that 's in my possession . I hope not . Patterson , will you show the major to his quarters ? Right , sir . This way , Major . There , that house . Abdul Azziz , the curio dealer , lives there . He is the man you must see . Wait . [ Whispering , Indistinct ] I don 't want to take anything for granted . - There 's no use both of us sticking our necks out . - Then let me go . No , you stay here . I 'll signal for you . All right ? [ Knocking ] Hello ! Good evening , sir . - We 've been expecting you . - Mr. Azziz . [ Ringing ] [ Grunting ] Stretching due east for three miles , an enormous fissure reaches into the cavern . It 's the only underwater entrance to it . Now , according to Major Amadi , the landward approaches to the cavern ... are very heavily fortified , because a new weapon of enormous power has been installed there . It 's already responsible for the destruction of three of our U-2 's ... and is now in violation of all international treaties ... and a direct threat to the Suez Canal . Major Amadi 's prepared to lead us against this installation . It 's the price he 's willing to pay for asylum . Now , Major , before I commit this submarine ... I want to know more about this rift under the caverns . We need plenty of elbow room . There 's plenty , sir . This tunnel is over 400 feet at its narrowest point . Headroom ? It 's 250 feet at the entrance , increasing to over 800 . What puzzles me is the lack of any underwater defenses . It seems to me there 's a flaw in your government 's thinking there . It 's my late government , sir . I no longer owe them my loyalty . Yes , of course . But can you tell me why that channel is wide open ? It 's very simple , sir . It 's too deep . We have no submarines that will operate at this level ... neither has anyone else . There 's only the Seaview . No submarine could hope to make that passage ... - so there are no defenses . - I see . Patterson , will you escort Major Amadi to the missile room ? - We 'll contact you when we 're in position . - Very well . Uh , Major ? - Yes ? - Can you tell me how you figured 400 feet ... is the width of that channel , especially since you can 't get any submarines down there ? We measured with our Fathometer , sir , from the surface . I see . Thank you . Well , if you 're thinking what I 'm thinking , Admiral ... You realize there 's only one way to measure that channel . Sure , physically . In a confined space like that , a Fathometer just wouldn 't work . If he 'd told me he used a diving bell , I might 've believed him . - Navigation , report . - [ On Speaker ] Navigation . We 're approaching the cavern area , dead ahead 6,000 yards . Maneuvering , answer bells to one-third . Answering bells to one-third . Aye , sir . Chip , I want you to bring us ... approximately 1,000 yards off the channel entrance . - Then come to a dead stop . - Aye , aye , sir . That 's all , gentlemen . [ On Speaker ] A hundred feet , sir . All stop . Rig for silent running . Aye , aye , sir . Rig for silent running . We 're going in , Chip . - Radio silence , minimum speed . - Maintain radio silence . Ahead dead slow . Aye , aye , sir . Patterson , you and Major Amadi still in the missile room ? [ Patterson ] Yes , sir . Well , keep him there . We 'll join you . Why are we waiting ? Where 's the admiral ? Relax , Major . There he is . Admiral , what has gone wrong with our plans ? We should have gone out by now . I should have gone into the mini-sub to show you the entrance to the cavern . We found it without your assistance , Major . You wouldn 't have lasted three seconds at this depth . Sir , I protest ! You could have tripped an alarm . But we didn 't . We 're bringing the sub up to 1,000 feet as soon as we can . Then I 'm sending the min-sub out to search the caverns . - Would you like to accompany me ? - Yes . Yes , of course . Yes . I imagined you might . - Is something troubling you , Admiral ? - Yes , Major , it is . It 's troubling me enough to make me want to back this sub out of here and head for safer waters . Sir , please , take my word ! We are on the threshold of an important discovery . I have no doubt we are , but there must be safer ways of getting information . - Excuse me , sir . - [ Mutters ] I 've underrated your people , Major . What have you done with Captain Crane ? I don 't understand . I don 't know . I don 't have any idea . You know perfectly well . We 've just been informed by shortwave from the underground ... that General Gamal has captured Crane . Now , where is he ? Where is he ? [ Clattering ] - Look at the torpedoes ! - Control , what happened ? - What happened to the torpedoes ? - They look like they 're stuck against the wall ! The lights . ! Cutting the circuit breakers . ! Control ! Come in , Control ! - Line 's dead . Check forward . - Aye , aye , sir . Admiral . [ Grunts ] What the devil ? All the hatches are jammed tight . Amadi . What are they using on us ? Patterson . You have five seconds to make up your mind , Major . Just five seconds . Have him pull the trigger , Admiral . Your gun will not fire . Nothing made of steel will move while our weapon is in operation . Your motors , your pumps , every piece of machinery on board is immobilized . - Magnetism . - The Magnus beam , Admiral . Now I understand why you were so anxious to get away in the mini-sub . I never wanted so much to pull a trigger . Why bother , Patterson ? I 'm already a dead man , gentlemen , just as you are . [ Bell Rings ] Come in , come in , signorina . Forgive me that I ask you to come to the home of my cousin . It 's a small matter of the police . They have taken it into their heads to watch me closely . - But if they are watching ... - Oh , we 're safe enough here . How much do the police know , Abdul Azziz ? Eh , nothing they can prove . Still , I 'm annoyed with them . They tapped my telephone ... which is how they arrested your American so easily . By the way ... who is he ? A man named Crane ... captain of the American submarine Seaview . - We must get word to them that he has been captured . - [ Scoffs ] I 'm told that has already been arranged . But , uh , tell me , how was I expected to help him ? By getting him information ... on the secret weapon which has destroyed American planes . Uh , now there is an area perhaps in which I may still be of help . The weapon you seek is hidden deep in the caverns under the naval base . It 's a marvelous new weapon , with which our beloved general ... Allah be gracious to him ... will make war and get us all killed . I must find out where he is . - And then ? - Then ? Then he must be rescued . All this will not be easy . For the sake of everything you believe in ... it must be done . - Admiral ? - [ Nelson ] What is it , Chip ? - The depth gauge is moving . It 's not frozen . - It 's a fiber needle , not steel . - It reacts to outside pressure . - It 's rising . I thought we were dead in the water . It 's impossible . We 're going up . Only a few feet a minute , but we 're going up . It 's the power of the Magnus beam , Admiral . Slowly but surely , it 's pulling your submarine toward it ... - with a force nothing can resist . - Let it pull . We 're going up . We 're headed for the surface . Not to the surface , Patterson , but to the Magnus beam . This submarine will be drawn irresistibly up ... until its hull is crushed like the thin shell of an egg . And you 're prepared to die with us with no effort to save your own miserable life . I don 't want to die . But if I have to pay the price , it will be worth it . Fanaticism is no substitute for intelligence , Amadi . I prefer to think of it as personal courage . Your intelligence built this submarine , my courage will destroy it . - [ Blows Landing ] - [ Crane Grunting ] Captain Crane , the ambitious plans I have for my government ... demand a certain severity . In a few hours , your submarine will be dead . Your stubbornness will have done no one any good . The Seaview is immobilized by our Magnus beam ... immobilized and slowly but surely dying . Actually , we have an intriguing choice open to us . We can crush your submarine in an hour or two ... or we could let the men die slowly , one by one , as their air is used up . Tell us about your contact in the underground ... and perhaps ... just perhaps ... your friends may be saved . - [ Grunts ] - This man will tell you nothing . Take him out and have him shot . [ Choked Grunts ] - Key . - [ Snapping Fingers ] Guard ? Guard ! [ Grunting , Groaning ] Lee ! Lee , it 's Luana . All right . - Come on . - How did you find me ? Abdul Azziz . You can trust him . There is a passage along here that leads into a deep well . It 's a difficult climb , but it 's the only way out . No . No , we 've gotta go this way . No ! You don 't know what you 're saying . Listen to me , Lee . We 've got to get out ! No ! Listen to me . The Seaview 's helpless out there . We gotta help them . We 've gotta go this way . Depth 3-8-5 . Still rising , Admiral . Your time is getting short . Shut up ! Sir , we 're not too deep now . We could use the scuba gear . If we could open the escape hatch . You tried it once , Curley . You know it 's hopeless . Yes , sir . Depth 3-7-5 feet and rising . Aah ! Now explain the special rifles . I don 't know how it works , but it 's immobilized the Seaview ... and it 's gonna destroy it unless we do something pretty fast . I believe the time 's come to fight . We can now use the help of my cousins . Curley . - Yes , sir . - Get that coil of copper wire over here ... - and the battery jumpers . - Aye , aye , sir . Lend a hand here . I want to move the mini-sub out in the open . Get the canopy open . - Kowalski ? - Sir ? - I 'll need the batteries out of here . - Aye , aye , sir . No , you 're wrong , Admiral . It won 't work . There 's nothing you can do . - I wouldn 't bet on it , Major . - Admiral , here 's the coil you wanted . - Put ' em over there by the hatch . - Yes , sir . - Got ' er loose , Kowalski ? - Yeah , one of them , sir . - I 'm working on the other now . - Soon as you get ' em out , bring ' em over here by the hatch . Captain , 250 and still rising . Hurry , men . We haven 't got much time . [ Approaching Footsteps ] With the help of Allah , I return with one of my cousins . - There are many more on the way . - What 's that ? A present for our beloved general , Allah glorify his name . - Dynamite . - Liberated from a careless digger of oil wells . These will pulverize the great machine , with hopefully just enough left over ... - for the general himself . - Great work , Abdul . But how do we get these explosives over to the machine ? The female mind is eternally bogged down with practicalities . No cover at all . He 'd be crossing under the noses of the sentries . We must do the best we can with what Allah has been pleased to send us . - Go find my cousins quickly , and bring ' em here the way we came . - [ Speaking Native Language ] Now we can do nothing but wait . 1-9-5 . Rising all the time , sir . - That 's enough , Curley . Now the next terminal . - Yes , sir . - Depth , Chip ? - 1 - 5-0 , sir . Still rising . - Hurry it up , Curley . - Yes , sir . - Do you really think you can get that hatch open in time ? - It depends . If the magnetic field created by the Magnus beam is anything like I think it is ... I can , at least for a minute or so . - Then give me diving equipment and let me get out . - Now , why would I do that ? I 'll arrange an honorable surrender for you . There 'll be no need for anyone to die . [ Chuckles ] Surrender , Major ? Patterson , break out the scuba gear . Yes , sir . [ Distant Clamoring ] Pfft , pfft ! - Distinguished visitors . - General Gamal . Our prisoner has escaped . He is still somewhere here in the cabin area . - He is to be shot on sight . - You men reinforce the sentry detail . Keep a sharp lookout . No one is to approach the Magnus beam . I want more guards posted . The rest of the garrison will join in the search for Crane . - Every inch of the cavern area must be covered . - Yes , sir . We 'll find them . If you don 't , I warn you , the consequences will be most unpleasant . We 've waited too long . I must crush the submarine at once . - Order full power on the Magnus beam . - Yes , sir . Oh , how I 'd like to give him a 21-gun salute . [ Imitates Gunshot ] Up to 1-0-5 feet , sir . The rate of ascent is increasing . Forget about the gauge , Chip , and get ready . We 're gonna do some attacking of our own . - Here they are , sir . - Thanks , Curley . Bring me those plastic explosives . - Yes , sir . ! - [ Morton ] We 're attacking with spear guns ? They 're made of aluminum . They won 't be affected by the ray . Besides , we have the element of surprise on our side . - Patterson . - Yes , sir . - Get ready to make the connection . - Aye , aye , sir . [ Footsteps Approaching ] Can 't move . We 're pinned down . And where are all the cousins you brag about ? What a burden it is when a man is dependent on his relatives . Wait ! Now they come . The family of Azziz is ready . Sentries everywhere and all that ground to cross . - What we need is a diversion . - Under any circumstances a diversion is a pleasant thing ... but now it would be a gift from Allah . I 'm gonna try for it myself . We can 't wait here . We 'll be slaughtered . Lee ! Don 't . Remember , the batteries can only neutralize the magnetic field for about 90 seconds ... so we 'll have to work fast . - Everybody ready ? - Yes , sir . All right , Patterson . Go ! [ Whining Hum ] No ! [ Grunts ] If you only knew , sir , how long I 've been wanting to do that . Good work , Patterson . Shall we try it again ? Right , sir . [ Humming Resumes ] - Well ? - I 've sent for some gas projectiles . We 'll saturate the tunnels and we 'll soon flush him out . Well , uh , how close is the Seaview to the base of the Magnus beam ? Less than 50 feet . Another two minutes it 'll be crushed to powder . Very good then . All we can do is watch and wait . Uh ! Allah be praised . There 's your diversion . Aah ! Uh ! [ Gamal ] The guard has left the catwalk . [ Falazir ] Strange . Look ! [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots Continue ] You stay here . Keep down . Aah ! [ Groaning ] Hit the deck ! - We 'll put you ashore at Ras Kandara as a prisoner . - I claim asylum , Admiral . You did that before , Amadi . We didn 't take your request at face value then . - What makes you think we will now ? - With General Gamal dead ... the new government will give you a most interesting trial , Major .

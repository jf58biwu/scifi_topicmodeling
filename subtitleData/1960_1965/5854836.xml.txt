 Typhoon number 8 out of the Carolina Islands with a central wind velocity of 60 meters per second and peak wind velocities up to 80 meters per second has developed into an extremely powerful typhoon . It is moving north toward the Japanese mainland at 50 kilometers per hour . Unit 7 , Unit 7 . A communication from the Shipping Association . Matsubishi Shipping 's 5600-ton Genyo-Maru II is caught at the center of the typhoon . They require immediate assistance . What is our present location ? 11.4 miles east of Infant Island . What ? Infant Island ? This is bad . This is the worst situation we could be in . Damn ! We 're sandwiched between the typhoon and radiation . Captain ! We 've run aground ! We 're taking on water ! We 're taking on water ! All hands abandon ship ! Abandon ship ! Abandon ship ! I 've got a bad feeling about flying through this much radiation . Look ! We 're almost out of fuel . JA 7046 calling Satsuma . We are running low on fuel . We are now leaving the search area . Is that ? There are people ! JA 7046 calling Satsuma . We 're patrolling the Infant Island area . We see what appears to be four people in trouble . Hey ! Hey ! Genyo-Maru II Survivors Return Observed for Radiation Sickness One moment ! One moment ! We have already stated there will be no interviews . Is their condition that serious ? How about a picture ? Even through a window . - Please . - Come on . Dr. Harada . Now , this is a surprise . No signs of radiation contamination . Here are their charts with all the test results . Have any of you noticed any symptoms ? For example , any unusual tiredness ? Any pain in joints ? No , nothing . Well ... What is it ? You know , they didn 't really give us enough rice to eat on the ship . - You . - I 'm from Nitto Press . Nitto Press ? We said no pictures yet . I 'll take that film . I 'm Zen . - I 'm Fukuda , Nitto social column . - What are you thinking ? - First of all , the radiation ... - poses no danger , right ? That 's what you said yourself , right ? Hi . Fukuda . Nice to meet you . Nothing we can do now , I guess . You 're in already . - They call Zen " The Snapping Turtle . " - Snapping Turtle ? Once I get ahold , I never let go . The old newspaperman spirit . We 've got 3 million readers waiting for news about this . That 's the real issue . So , what do your 3 million readers want to know most ? These men came back alive and healthy from deadly levels of radiation . That 's truly miraculous . How did they manage to live through it ? I know . Maybe it was that red juice . - Red juice ? - What are you talking about ? The natives gave it to us . The natives ... Natives ? What natives ? Infant Island is uninhabited ! Headline on the evening edition : Mystery Natives of Infant Island . - Sounds like a detective novel . - Shut up . One more thing . The Rolisican Embassy statement . The Rolisican government verified that Infant Island was totally uninhabited before using the island as a test site for atomic and hydrogen bombs . We see no need to question this conclusion at the present time . Ambassador , what about the expedition team ? It is not affiliated with the Rolisican government . Is there an authority on the geography of that area ? - There 's the linguist , Professor Chujo . - Chujo ? Shinichi Chujo . He 's recently back from doing research in Polynesia . Good . Get pictures , too . I thought you 'd say that . I already sent Michi to get some . - He was toying with me . - You didn 't get any pictures ? - I took some . - Let 's see . What is this ? That 's a real masterpiece . He says he likes pictures as much as taking medicine . Nitto Press Chujo This is no good . We 've got lots of things we 'd like to ask you . Mr. Chujo , why did Rolisica suddenly propose a joint expedition ? They 've even announced a leader for the expedition . You 'd have to ask the Rolisican government . His attitude is just silly . Okay , okay , you win . We won 't take your picture . Could you at least show your face ? It 's not a face worth showing . - I hate them ! - What is it ? - Zen ... - What 's this ? I apologize . Hey , Shinji ! Shinji ! Yes ? I told you not to let him out of your room . He got away . We were looking for him ! Chiro ! Don 't run away ! Chiro ! Come here ! Hold on , I 'll catch him for you . Here , Chiro . Chiro , Chiro . - Don 't squish him . - I won 't . Did you catch him ? What 's wrong ? - Could you ? - What ? Right here . Chiro , Chiro . - Here . - Thank you . - Thanks . - So you 're going with the expedition ? - It hasn 't been decided yet . - I heard at the Ministry of Education . So if you 're going as a linguist it 's to speak with the natives , right ? We 'll have to get there and see . The Polynesians have much in common in language , customs and culture . So there are no great differences between natives of Hawaii and Tahiti ? Have you heard the legend that Polynesia was once one huge landmass ? Like Atlantis . Looks like you don 't believe that theory . I only believe the reality I see through my camera . So that 's why you want to take pictures so badly . The sound of the shutter reminds me of a guillotine . A guillotine ? You 're joking . Relax . The latest guillotines don 't make any sound . Infant Island Expedition Rolisica Expedition Team That was Harada , the leader of the Japanese team . Hey , it 's Nelson ! Let us through ! Let us through ! Social Column Editor What ? No press ? That 's ridiculous , especially in this day and age ! Who said that ? Everyone is angry that we 're not bringing the press along . There 's no special reason . We just want this to be a success . So you 're saying we reporters would get in your way ? No , no . You and I are thinking about different things . In any case , I 'm in charge . We can 't take reporters along . Why are you hanging around here ? I 'm done listening to stupid excuses . So who is this Nelson ? He 's the man in charge . I know that . What 's his background ? I don 't know . He doesn 't look like a professor . Why is he being so secretive ? Seems like he 's hiding something . Don 't you think ? Yeah . - Very suspicious . - Yeah , it is suspicious . No , I mean you . What are you scheming about ? Me ? Scheming ? Infant Island Expedition Sendoff Come back safely ! Come back safely ! Zen ? Zen ! Oh , Dr. Harada . Is the meeting over ? - You 're lucky , sitting here carefree . - Is there some problem ? I don 't like that Nelson 's attitude . He says he 's going to keep control of all the expedition data . That 's ridiculous ! An academic expedition like this should be pure and unhindered . There could be some secret agency behind this . Come out . - What were you doing ? - Just cleaning . Why do you have this ? It was on the floor . What is it ? I don 't remember hiring a cabin boy from Nitto Press . Oops . - So long . - Wait . Do you think you can just walk out of here ? - What 's that outfit ? - Can I help you ? I want to ask something . I have to submit my materials to you ? Of course . Is that an order from the Rolisican government ? It 's the request of the team . Well , I refuse . Let 's go . Attention all expedition members . We will soon be entering the radiation danger zone . Report for radiation suit inspection . Dr. Harada , how did it go ? Did you talk to him ? Yes , I finally got him to consent . I promised absolutely no reporting . So I 'm a security guard now . I 'm Fukuda from Nitto . Thank you . Dr. Harada , why do we have to ask for Nelson 's permission on everything ? Professor Rakh defers completely to Nelson . He does ? About this Professor Rakh ... Just a security guard , that 's me . We will now go ashore . We hope you will all perform your duties with caution and care . We have great hope for the expedition 's success . If you encounter any emergencies use your radio to call for help immediately . If you receive an emergency call gather at the site and await directions . That is all . Chujo ! You ! What are you doing ? - I 'm lost . - What ? I 'm lost . I got separated from Chujo . What are these plants growing here ? These aren 't normal plants . They seem to be mutations of mold . Yes . It 's mold . The drink the Genyo-Maru II survivors were given must have come from this . We 've searched this much , but we still haven 't found anything . It 's strange . Sir . Chujo 's gone . Over there ! Chujo ! What happened ? Chujo ! Chujo ! Wake up ! Chujo . Hi . What do you mean , " Hi " ? What happened ? I was ensnared by a blood-sucking plant . The ones who saved me were extremely small humans . Small humans ? Natives ? No . They were these incredibly small women , only a foot tall . What ? Small women ? It wasn 't a hallucination ? No , I 'm sure of it . You need some rest tonight . We 'll look into it tomorrow . So how did the tiny beauties save you ? - Tiny beauties ? - Yeah . That 's a news expression . We call every young woman a beauty . So these are tiny beauties . - That 's it ! - What ? Yeah , that was it ! Well , good night . What kind of attitude is that ? What was that all about ? You 've got to be kidding . What happened ? Chujo ! What happened ? - Stop fooling around . - I 'm not fooling around . I realized last night that they 're very sensitive to sound . They showed up to save me yesterday after hearing the alarm device . A song ! They 're singing ! No , it 's not a song . That 's their language . It doesn 't belong to any linguistic system . It 's more of a code . Do you understand what they 're saying ? It seems like they 're asking us not to harm their island . Of course . They 've had atomic and nuclear testing here before . We 're absolutely not going to test nuclear bombs here . - Hey ! Don 't hurt them ! - What are you doing ? These are hard-to-find specimens . I 'm taking them . Poor things ! Let them go . - Doctor . - Nelson ! Natives ! There ! We 're surrounded ! Spread out ! Release them . We have weapons . There 's no need to fight on a scientific expedition . Guards , put your guns away ! Guns down ! Boss , what do we do ? Really ? Are you sure ? Hand them over . Everybody gather back at the advance base . - Everybody back ! - Gather at the base ! You know , doctor , maybe this is just a romantic notion but wouldn 't it be better just to leave this island alone ? They 've finally returned . Nelson , head of the expedition made only a brief statement about their trip with no announcements , leaving everyone very curious . Curiosity ? I can 't publish curiosity . How is that going to satisfy three million angry readers ? Where 's Fukuda ? Get Fukuda for me . Hey , Zen . - Welcome back ! - Oh , welcome back ! Hope you had a good trip ! What 's with you ? You never contacted anyone . I was worried . The boss is furious . That 's just not enough . Can you give us more ? What about the radiation ? Any new discoveries ? Can 't you just tell us something ? Are you ignoring us ? Infant Island Expedition Dissolved Rakh Rushes Back Home No Findings Announced Clark Nelson . Date of birth , place of birth , prewar career all unlisted . In 1954 , he made an expedition to the Amazon in search of beautiful women for use in entertainment . While this expedition failed , he is still known as an explorer . I think he 's an international dealer in artifacts . Get it ? An artifacts dealer ? Digging up whatever ruins he finds and stealing artifacts . I hear there 's a lot of money in it . You know something , don 't you ? I found some strange old writings he had on Infant Island . Fukuda , there 's something about that island . Look at this . What is this ? A rubbing of secret writings I found in a cave on the island . A cave ? There was a cave ? A very mysterious cave . I would have told Harada and the Japanese members but hesitated because of Nelson . The same glyph appears four times here . I thought that was a clue to decoding it . Since there 's a lot in common I 'm trying to work with this Polynesian reference to decipher it . So , what does this repeated glyph say ? Mothra . What ? Mothra ? What does that mean ? I don 't know . Hello , my lovely ladies . I 'm so happy to see you again . Boss ! The natives ! Fire ! Fire and let 's go ! Mothra ! Mothra ! So , Snapping Turtle , how long have we been paying your salary ? - Five years and three months . - Is that right ? You saw them on Infant Island , didn 't you ? So why didn 't you write a piece on this ? I was keeping it quiet . Damn it ! You 've got no guts as a reporter ! - Reporters are human , too . - What ? I saw them . We all saw them . But did anyone say anything ? We all thought , as human beings , it was better to keep it quiet . I 'm a human being , too ! Thank you all for coming . We now live in the atomic age . But are miracles a thing of the past ? Is mystery merely a word ? No . Miracles still exist . I 'm going to the front ! Mysteries are not just in dreams . Now , let me show you the modern-day mystery , the modern-day miracle that I have discovered after great hardships . Allow me to introduce my lovely fairies . - Are you by yourself ? - No , my big brother 's in the back . I got word by airmail from Rakh . He said the Rolisican government wasn 't enthusiastic about launching the expedition . That must have irritated Nelson . So Nelson pushed them by paying all the expenses himself . That 's why he got complete control . That melody . No meddling . Go home . I 'm not here to meddle . I want an interview ! I already told you that my fairies don 't understand speech . Hey . What are you doing ? Stop it ! Cut it out ! - What 's going on ? - Zen ! Nelson . This is a rare pleasure . - I need to talk to you . - About what ? I want you to stop this inhumanity and return them to their island . Inhumanity ? Ridiculous . Strictly speaking , they 're just scientific data . Those fairies aren 't human . They 're merchandise . What are you saying ? The newspapers are full of criticism ! People are just jealous of the show 's success . You 're keeping those girls confined to serve your own personal greed ! Confined ? What a joke . Did you see the show ? The fairies are happy when they sing . Where are they ? Well , you 're not strangers so I 'll let you see them for three minutes . I want you to listen to how happy they are . Your camera , Miss . We have enough advertising . All right , all right ! Here , take it . - You don 't have to worry . - Oh , they 're cute . Do you remember me ? You saved me from that blood-sucking plant . We can 't leave them in a cage . We should take them home with us . No . We don 't know what Nelson and his men might do . Those guys are all too cocky . I agree with you . Hey , don 't give up hope . There are lots of people in the world who sympathize with you . Thank you . We won 't give up hope . Do you understand our language ? Not just language . We can communicate our feelings to places far , far away . You mean telepathy ? Telepathy ! We will get back to our island . But ... But what ? For us to be saved innocent people in your country will suffer a great misfortune . - A great misfortune ? - Why ? Mothra will come . Mothra ? Mothra is coming . Coming to save us . Life eternal to Mothral Mothra , answer our prayersl Arise nowl This is libel ! Retract these comments ! There 's no basis for this negative press . We 're very responsible for verifying the facts we print . Fine . So you refuse to retract this . I 'm going to the Rolisican Embassy . This will turn into an international issue . Boss ! This should be our front-page headline ! " From RP . Large unidentified object floating in the South Pacific . " - What is this ? - I 'm sure it 's Mothra ! Mothra . What the hell is Mothra ? It 's a dinosaur-like ... An ancient monster in Infant Island legends . It 's coming to save the tiny beauties . You should be in advertising instead of being a journalist . - We heard it from the two girls . - What ? It 's true . They clearly said Mothra would come to save them . Radio listeners , this is truly the mystery of the century . We regret that we are only able to broadcast these sounds to you . - Hard to port ! - Hard to port ! No , bring it back ! Luxury Liner Orion-Maru Meets with Disaster Floating Object Found You 're going too far ! Too far ? Do you deny what happened to the Orion-Maru ? - It has nothing to do with me . - That 's exactly right . Whatever some giant monster does is completely unrelated with our work . Listen ! Unless you return the tiny beauties to the island Mothra will come here ! To Japan ! Right here to Tokyo ! By then , it 'll be too late ! Stop with these false accusations ! I 'm getting annoyed ! - Nelson ... - Shut up ! Boss ... There 's no use talking about it . In order to defend his rights and honor as a Rolisican citizen we will leave this country . Then we can resolve this . - Leaving the country ? - Sounds fine . Leave the country , do whatever you want . Let 's go , Chujo . - Chujo , there 's nothing we can do . - Yeah . It 's frustrating , but whatever we do won 't matter . - Maybe , but we have one more option . - One more ? To talk to the girls . What do you want ? We want to talk to the girls . No way . Didn 't you see the " do not enter " sign downstairs ? I saw it . You can 't go in ! Stop it . Let 's not resort to violence . Come on , Chujo . - What 's going on here ? - We 'll take care of them ! We don 't have any other choice . I 'll take care of this bunch . Go talk to them , fast . I 'm counting on you . Let go ! Let go ! Zen , The Snapping Turtle , never lets go once he gets ahold ! Innocent people are going to suffer . Can 't you make Mothra turn back ? Mothra doesn 't understand right and wrong . He has only the instinct to take us back to the island . Really , there 's nothing you can do ? We 're sad too , but there 's nothing we can do . I 've got one more idea . Telepathy . - Their telepathy . - Can you block it off ? What you see here is her brain waves . This is a synthetic material used in nuclear reactors . It blocks all forms of wave energy . Look at that . If we make a box from this , we can hide the tiny beauties from Mothra . Target sighted ! It 's a monster 100 meters in length ! - Location ? - Longitude , 137 degrees 10 minutes . Latitude , north 23 degrees 10 minutes . Heading 011 . It 's heading north . Dispatch Attack Squadron 1 now . This is the front page of our evening edition . I don 't care if we 're past deadline . Put in this headline : Mothra to be Annihilated at Sea . - I feel kind of sorry for Mothra . - What ? It 's Nelson 's fault . If he 'd return the tiny beauties to the island ... - Damn it ! - What 's the matter ? Rolisica is backing Nelson up . " The government of Rolisica shall defend the rights and property of its citizens overseas . " Go ! Get a statement from the Defense Ministry ! Target spotted . Commence bombing ! Fire ! Fire ! So all your cares were for nothing . You 've concluded that Mothra is dead from the attack ? Of course . There 's nothing more to worry about . They haven 't confirmed the kill . I think it 's too soon to tell . You 're all so kind in your concern . We 're not concerned about you ! Easy . A lot of people may suffer because of your greed ! That box can block their telepathy , but we 're not doing it for you . Don 't misunderstand us . - All clear . - Good work . - We hit the jackpot . - You outdid yourself . Not me . The lady at the tea shop made it for us . She said no tour groups are coming out with all this Mothra hubbub . Works out great for us . Another earthquake ? It 's not a very big one . Thank you , gentlemen . I probably won 't need it but I 'll keep that box around . How about staying for the show ? It 's about to start . No , thanks . You don 't have to pay . You 're all my guests . Mr. Nelson , you have a call . Pardon me . Hello , this is Nelson . What ? My show 's been shut down ? I can 't believe these Japanese police ! Why are you shutting me down ? Take it up with my embassy ! Now I 'm offended . Zen ! What are you doing hanging around here ? I know , the show 's been shut down . Nelson just got the call . Not the show ! Dam 3 is in trouble ! The dam ? Could it be Mothra ? - I don 't know the details , but hurry . - Let 's go . What 's that ? It 's cracking ! Get out ! Stop it ! No matter how much you cry , you 're not going back to your island . Shut up ! I 'm not letting you go even if Mothra comes ! Get out of here ! Run ! Stop ! Stop ! Hey ! You in the car , stop ! Doctor ! It must be Mothra ! Why is it all the way out here ? Get out ! It 's too dangerous ! You have to get out of here ! Get out ! Get out ! Hurry ! Hey ! Hurry ! " Mothra " Appears In Tokyo Vanishes After Destroying Dam Nelson Firmly Refuses " To Return Tiny Beauties to Island ! " Mothra is rampaging because Nelson won 't return those small women . Many are suffering because of him . It 's all Nelson 's fault . - Where is he ? - What 's going on ? - A kid got in here . - A little punk in a red baseball cap . That 's a problem . The boss is gonna be mad . We have to find the kid before he gets back from the embassy . Let 's go ! I 'm taking you out of here . Thank you . But Mothra is coming . Run away , quickly . I 'm fine . Come to my house . My brother will be glad to see you . - You weren 't doing your job ! - Idiots ! What are you doing ? - A kid snuck in ... - Forget the kid ! We 're leaving now ! There he is ! - Hey ! Get him ! - Hey , wait ! - Did you see him ? - He 's not here . - Was he there ? - He 's not downstairs . Where 'd that little brat go ? Boss ! He 's here ! - Come on , kid . - No point struggling . Ow ! Idiot ! Oh , that hurt ! Boss ! The Rolisican Embassy finally came through . " The Rolisican government requests that Mr. Nelson renounce ownership of the tiny beauties for the sake of good relations . " - Good . Make it the headline . - I 'm going to see the handover . I want to see Nelson 's face . - Big trouble ! - I know . You better hurry ! - Come on . - Fukuda ! Hey , Chujo ! How did you know ? - Know what ? - Nelson 's finally done for . I didn 't . My little brother Shinji came here to get the tiny beauties . He did ? Fukuda ! This is Shinji 's ! It 's Shinji ! Shinji ! Shinji ! - Shinji ! - Shinji ! Brother ! He 's awake ! - Are you okay ? - Nelson got away ! Don 't worry . They 're going to catch Nelson in no time . - We 've got trouble . - I know it . Nelson got away . No , that 's not it . Mothra 's back ! What did you say ? Mothra ? Where ? Yokota Base , heading towards Tokyo . 9 : 00 , special artillery battalion assembled on Keihin Highway 2 at Tama River . Defense Squad 2 , change course to Shibuya . Defense Squad 3 assembled at National Stadium . Go back ! Everybody back ! Mothra has passed Ome Highway into the southern district , headed for Shibuya . All residents of the Shibuya area , please evacuate quickly following the direction of the defense forces . Back up ! Turn around ! Boss , this way 's no good either ! We can only get away by sea . Turn back . I have an idea . We 've gathered our forces in a line at Tameike and Akasaka Mitsuke . We 'll make a concentrated attack . 2150 hours , Mothra has reached Tokyo Tower . It is showing signs of some kind of change . All right ! - Standing by ! - Ready ! Commander ! Emergency orders ! Cease fire ? Roger ! Cease fire ! What 's that thread ? Headquarters ! It 's building a cocoon ! If Mothra comes out as an adult , we 're in big trouble . We have to return those girls to Infant Island before that happens . Director , where is Nelson now ? We 're putting in every effort , but we still have no leads . Special flight 203 to Rolisica , now departing . Boss , you 're now George Walker member of the Rolisican Embassy staff . Excuse me . - Boss ! - You 're standing here watching ? - We 're covering Mothra . - You should be going after Nelson . - Tell that to the police . - You call yourself a reporter ? A child could report on Mothra in a cocoon . Go after Nelson ! In all this confusion , I 'm afraid there 's no way to search for Nelson . If Nelson gets on a plane , he could be in Rolisica by tomorrow morning . - Then what would happen ? - That would cut off our last hope . As he follows the tiny beauties , Mothra 's rampage will get worse . To Haneda Airport ! We apologize for the inconvenience . Rolisica will send all possible support to help with this great misfortune . And the atomic heat cannon ? Will it be here before the adult Mothra emerges ? Don 't worry . It will be here in time . Mothra remains quiet at present in the cocoon it built on Tokyo Tower . However , if it emerges as an adult we fear it will show unimaginable ferocity . The Japanese government with the assistance of the Rolisican Atomic Heat Ray Brigade will soon commence attacks upon Mothra 's cocoon . This is amazing . - The attack commences at 10 : 00 . - Ten o 'clock ? Orders from Defense Headquarters . Orders from Defense Headquarters . The attack will commence at 10 a. m . As the atomic heat cannon produces great heat we ask all onlookers to take all necessary precautions . Minus 60 seconds to attack ! Zen , your glasses . Minus 30 seconds ! Minus 20 seconds ! Minus 10 seconds ! Nine , eight , seven six , five , four , three , two , one ! To my radio listeners and all people of the world ... Boss , if we got this far , we 're safe . Of course . This isn 't Japan . It 's the great land of Rolisica . I didn 't know you had such a marvelous ranch . We seem to have defeated Mothra one of the great monsters of this century . You can hear relief in the voices on microphones at the battle site . People , people of the world , breathe easy . Mothra has been destroyedl Boss , boss ! We can breathe easy as we get filthy rich ! Go ahead and sing . Sing more . Sing all you want . Mothra won 't come . Sing ! Sing ! Chujo ! Look ! I think it 's flying off to Rolisica . Do you think so , doctor ? So I guess Nelson did run off to Rolisica . Rolisica 's air force has been completely annihilated by Mothra . This report has come as a great shock to the Rolisican people . Criticism of Mr. Nelson , who has disappeared continues to spread and grow . The federal police has ordered an emergency search for Nelson . Boss , it 's over ! Even if we flee , they 're just going to corner us . This must have surprised you . - Was this your doing ? - We 're going at Rolisica 's request . Don 't tell me they want us to talk to Mothra . - Something like that . - Seriously ? That 's crazy , just crazy . The problem is the tiny beauties . We 're known to be the only friends the tiny beauties will talk to . I see . But we don 't know where they are . So we have to catch Nelson and take the girls back to the island . Attention , all passengers . Mothra has been sighted in New Kirk City . Boss ! We 're going the wrong way . Get up those stairs . Chujo , what do we do ? - Shall we open it right up ? - No ! Mothra 's extremely irritated . It 'll fly right to us . This whole area will be destroyed . It 's all over for New Kirk City . Father ... Chujo . Do you remember this ? - The writing from Infant Island . - That 's right . Look at that . I get it . This mark is something the natives used to pray to Mothra . - Right . Hey , those bells they sound like the melody those girls were singing . Chujo , isn 't there a way to use this mark and the bells to do something ? Mothra , the secret prayer and the song . Okay , let 's give it a try . Please make a giant drawing of this mark on the airfield . - This one ? - As quickly as possible . We 'll try it . And could you have all the churches in town ring their bells at 3 : 00 ? - All church bells at 3 ? - That 's right . I 'll contact them immediately . Do you think it 'll work ? I don 't know . We can only pray for success . I 'm no priest , but we 'll just have to leave it all to the grace of God . Let 's get to the airport . It 's 3 : 00 now . Is it my imagination , or has Mothra calmed down ? It 's coming this way . Is everything okay ? Okay , let 's open the box . Thank you all . We pray that all the world 's people can live in peace . Thank you all . And we promise we 'll never disturb the peace of Infant Island . Thank you . Mothra is waiting . Goodbye . Take care of yourselves . It 's kind of strange to say it , but take care . Goodbye . - Goodbye ! - Goodbye ! I have to call the boss . This 'll be the top story . Oh , no ! I forgot to take pictures ! A prayer for peace and prosperity to last for all eternity .

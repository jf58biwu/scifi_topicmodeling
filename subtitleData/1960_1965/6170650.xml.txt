 - Ok , Venus ? - Ok , Steve . Okay , come on . THE DAY THE EARTH ICED STEVE ZODIAC ASTRONAUTA EMERGENCY Get ready . Emergency . Emergency . What 's going on , Comandante Zero ? We have a ship down patrol by remote control Steve . Remote ? The crew is not in control ? Está certo , Cel Zodiac . The pilot managed to bring the XL27 close to Earth , but he must have passed out . Retro by remote control , Commander . Sure , Ninety . Keep the nose up . Download the landing gear . Hey ... You 're under arrest ! Well , it came down . Firefighters are prepared . Put on something , the two , Let 's take a look at the XL27 and find out what happened to the crew . Prepared with the flashlight , Steve ? All the ship 's lights seem to have failed . Yes , Matt . I 'll go first . What is this , Steve ? Hmm , it seems they were struck by lightning eat . Better call Venus , Matt . They need medical care and fast ! Ok , Steve . Call Dr. Venus . Emergency ! There are burn marks next to the ship , Steve , I say , a very powerful weapon caused it . Sim , Comandante . A cannon eat ground to air , I suppose . But why ? XL 27 CABINE DE CONTROLE . The copilot 's cold . The captain also . Wait a minute . He 's moving . See . He has something in his hand . Zavia planet . Danger . Okay , let 's go back and try to understand it all . See what Venus has to say . Here is the location of Zavia . Sector 29 . And XL27 patrolling this sector . I think they noticed something strange and were checking . But Zavia is a completely uninhabited planet . What XL27 found there ? They certainly have not found a coma cannon . Everything is possible in this crazy universe , Steve . How can you know if you did not check ? That sounds like orders from , Colonel . I 'll have to prepare the Fireball XL5 for takeoff . Thank you Lieutenant . Thread ... It is a crazy way there . The excavators are going well , Cardray . Soon the underground base is ready . Sim Lines . You can begin to dismantle the cannon Eat . We will not need it to protect our work . No . No one can see it while covered in ice and snow . At propósito ... I did not give her congratulations for the good aim with the cannon Eat , when that ship hit the Space Patrol . Yes , yes , it was a good shot , right ? I hope that that ship is floating in space , lost forever . What are you doing Venus taking so long with the medical report ? Oh , it 's coming now , Commander . - What new , Venus ? - It was the radius Eat right , Steve . - They 've awakened Venus ? - No , Commander Zero . I think they will be in a coma for a month . Well , we can not wait a month . You will have to go without information , Steve . Okay , Commander . We are on the way . Fireball XL5 , ok takeoff , Commander . Understood , Lieutenant . Now I 'm going to bed ... Boy , that night was this . Father , I will ! Levante , father . What time is it ? Six in the morning ? See if you let me get some sleep , okay ? But father ! It 's snowing outside . I do not care if it is raining platypus Mars . Nevando ? I do not believe . Just do not believe it . It seems some kind of dream . That 's what it is . I 'm dreaming ! Retro shoot , Matt . Soon to disconnect or cone . Certo , Steve . Robert está na cabine central . Keep orbit the planet Zavia , Robert . Keep going . Well , what do you think , Matt ? It looks pretty quiet . Nothing in sight . As the XL 27 packed problems here ? I do not know , Steve . But surely something happened . We have to dive straight in this mystery . Oh , my head . Venus ? Matt ? Are you okay ? Well , I feel a little dizzy , Steve . But what happened ? It seems we chose a crack in the ice to stop . Our weight broke the ice bridge and bingo . We fall into an underground cavern . Hey Matt , Venus , listen . That sounds ... running water . And look Steve , steam . I think I feel heat . This is very strange . Hot water vapor in a frozen planet ? Let 's go ahead and find out where is going . Straight ahead , Steve . There is a bend in the tunnel . Be careful . You never know what awaits us . Steve , it seems an ice-covered door . We will try to unfreeze it . This can be very interesting . Well , there is a reception committee waiting for us , Venus . We will leave our jetmóveis here . Come on . Esse place looks ter been cut by machines . For what purpose ? There is another door forward . There is ... This should open by lightning . Well , I hope you are not watching us with plutonic eyes . Well , soon we will know . Matt ... is some kind of nuclear reactor . Yes , Steve . That 's where comes the hot water . But what it does , it generates power or what ? That 's what I intend to find out . I can help you do this , Earthman . Why do you and your colleagues do not come with me , please ? Now we leave the most comfortable , I want to know who they are and what they do here . The name is Steve Zodiac , Colonel Zodiac . What are we doing here , I do you the same question . I think we are responsible for what happened to the XL27 . You 're right , Steve Zodiac . It was our powerful cannon Eat that did the damage . Coronel was lucky that the cannon was disassembled before his arrival . We do not believe that the ship could return to Earth . Before we get rid of Colonel . Zodiac and his companions , I would like to see what we do here , Cardray . Ah , sim . We have deflected the sun 's rays . The land is freezing . Why , their crazy demons ? Will all die . It 's getting colder , Lieutenant . The Jack doing about heating ? It is a losing battle , Commander . No one can stop this freezing . It is as if the sun 's rays do not come more down to earth . You will not get anything out of it . - You Can not deflect the rays forever . You do not need . A month is more than enough time to destroy all life na Terra . Why ? Why ? I went to your planet Earth , three years ago with some of my people from Jeddum planet . Oh , sim . Sim , eu me lembro . The Jeddum delegation . They tried to create problems between the Earth leaders . But their plans failed , was not Cardray ? You thought it would take the Earth as we were fighting against each other . I must admit I underestimated his peace drive , Earthman . Have you seen my banishment and my people forever from the earth . But now we will have our revenge . Lines . Put them on ice cell . Yes , immediately Cardray . I know his reputation , Zodiac . Do not try to escape . - You 'll regret it . - What does it mean ? I do not know , Venus . He is right . Just get out of here through the door or through that tunnel . So we have a choice . We stayed here and let the earth be destroyed or we risk the tunnel . What will it be ? - Venus ? - Come on , Steve , let 's try . I do not like it . The snow under our feet does not seem very safe . Help ! Help ! I 'm falling ! Steve ! Where are you ? Well ... I think I know what he meant about repent . Steve , Matt , look . I think this camera is used to collect the boiling water reactor . So it would seem . One type of cooling system . I hate to say this , but this place will be full of boiling water . And when the ice melts , it will fall . Matt , help me up . I think I can reach that opening . The water is coming faster now . Can you ... Can you achieve , Steve ? I do not know . I could only hold me a little . No , no , it 's no use . There 's no way . Then we are finished . Nothing ... Nothing can stop this water . Hey Matt , give me your belt . - Why ? - Do not ask . Just give me . But what will you do ? In that Professor belt can help ? - Here Steve . - Now look . And keep your fingers crossed . I got it . You are creating steps on the ice . Well , I ... I can not see anything . My glasses are fogged . Steve ... Streve , you need to hurry . The water is rising and it 's getting warmer . I 'm almost there . I need to get ... Otherwise we will boil and freeze . Almost there . Just ... Just a few minutes . Steve fast , fast . Ok , ok . I think I can ... get there . Quick , follow me . I can hear the walls cracking . Grab the hand of Steve when reaching , Venus . Ok , Professor . You better run too , Matt . The water is coming faster now . Just a few steps , Matt . Be fast . The walls are collapsing . Okay , Steve . I 'm almost at the top . I think . But I can not see anything with these ... My glasses ! After all , I can now see what I 'm doing . Well , now , Steve ? Let 's go back to our jetmóveis . So let 's take care of Cardray and his little scheme . Let 's hope it 's not too late to save the Earth . Lieutenant . I-I think it 's the end . Sim , C-comandante . It was cool ... c-know you . You ... gave scolding sometimes The fact is ... Mr. is a bear with sometimes headache . But it was fun working with you . Sim , sim ... You know , my bark is stronger than my bite . It was nice having you around . Takeoff Okay , Matt . Prepare the missile . Entendido , Steve . Prepare to fire the missile , Matt . Ok , Matt , Venus , go home to see what damage the freezing caused . If we destroy the deflector in time , everything will be normal when we get to Earth . Well , I hope you 're right , Matt . As it was here while we were away , Sr ? Pay attention , Zodiac . I that I speak . Why did not the report ? While you 're hunting rainbow in space , we were freezing to death ! - But Commander , we er ... - Save yourself , Matt . He will not believe you , the way it is now . Commander , you need a vacation . Yes , I was told that Switzerland is great . All that ice and snow and the skis ... Get out . Leave me alone ! I do not know why I put clowns in XL5 . - Get out ! - Okay , Commander , we go . But think of the trip to Switzerland . Biting cold , ice , snow ... Out ! Get out of here ! Translation - Neverlost

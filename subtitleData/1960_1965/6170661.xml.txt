 - Ok , Venus ? - Ok , Steve . Right . Come on . A TRIADE Commander Zero , happened another planetary explosion in deep space . Yes , yes , I know Lieutenant . Computers are getting crazy ! - Which region ? - In the sector 25 again , Com . In the same place the other explosions . This can be serious . Radiation can be colossal . We recorded six explosions in recent weeks . What 's going on there ? Fireball XL5 is in sector 25 , right ? Contact Steve Zodiac . Maybe he has a better reading . Commander understood . Space City para Firebal XL5 . Responda por favor . Responda Steve Zodiac . Space City chamando . Neutroni transmitting Loud and clear . XL5 here . What can I do for you ? I think Space City caught that explosion , Steve . They must be wanting more information . Exactly , Prof. Matic . How were the explosions ? You can indicate the location ? We are having interference . Prof. Matic traced the explosions near the Triad , Commander planet . Triad ? It was not the planet baptized a few months ago ? Exactly . It is outside of the mapped sectors . Only superficial observations were made the sector edge 25 . It is found that looks like the Earth , but with three times its size . Atmosphere and Climate also appear to be equal . Well , these explosions appear to be three times stronger than we 've ever seen . I think they should do all great there . It is best to check Triad and remember Colonel , you are going deeper into space than ever before . Ok , Matt , Venus , They are prepared to cross the space frontier ? Of course I am , Steve . Hey , Zoonie , is not exciting ? Welcome to Home ... Well , I think exciting anyway . It 's a long way , Steve . It is best to take the course ... ultra 2-1-9-0 red . Yeah , I think is the shortest route . In three weeks we will be in the Triads region . Okay , Robert , new course . Ultra 2-1-9-0 red . Ultra 2-1-9-0 red . Well , they 're going , sir . Is not mapped in the area now . Try to keep them in Neutroni frequency , Lieutenant . This will be difficult . They are getting out of reach . Okay , Robert , take over . Keep this course . Maintain the present course . This gives a strange feeling is not Steve ? Crossing the boundaries of space , going where no one has gone before . True , Venus . But I think for everything there is a first time . It is . It is the first time I was late for breakfast . I hope you 're not cold . This is the seventh explosion , Commander Zero . I can not be telling , you know Lieutenant Ninety . How far Fireball XL5 is the Triad planet now ? It should be in the area in six days Commander . Long enough for another six explosions . What , for heaven 's causing this ? How long , Matt ? We are at full power . Well , I imagine that this speed will further 4 days . You can see the planet by Triad Espaçomógrafo , Steve . Ah , yes , yes . I see . The flashing . I see the planet Triad , Matt . Prepare to enter orbit . Certo , Steve . I 'm getting a strong radiation outside . The walls of the Fireball will resist it . Soon to disconnect Fireball Jr . Think Zoonie and Robert will be well in control unit ? Oh , I think so , Steve . After Robert just have to keep Fireball in orbit while Zoonie sleep most of the time . Prepared . Disconnect the cone now . We are increasing the speed . Very fast ! A gravidade , Steve . It is three times greater than the earth and we need to use three times more power . We will burn . Retro trigger . But we use a lot of fuel , Steve ! Not helping . Let disintegrate ! Shooting main retro . Speed ​ ​ increasing again , Steve . Ok . Shoot retro again . But ... But the fuel , Steve ! We will not have enough to take off . Let 's worry about taking off later . Retro firing auxiliaries . We continue flying very fast , Steve ! I 'll have to use the emergency retro . It 's working ! We are slowing . Steve , the fuel is running out . We can not use retro again . Hold steady . Let 's land . Sorry to blow . I 'll check to see the status of Junior . We 're out of fuel but the ship is full . We were lucky landing . Let 's look around us jetmóveis . Remember gravity , Steve . We need three times more force to fly in jetmóveis . Ok . Matt . Out here it is really crazy . Now I know what an ant feels in an orchard . Vamos , Matt . Come fast . You need to see this . Hey ! I 'm running out of fuel . This is starting to become a habit . This is the increase in power that we use depending on the seriousness . I think we have to walk . Hey , I feel heavy as lead . Ei , Matt . Not to miss this grown garden . Okay , Steve . I just came here to shorten way . It seems to be the way out of this jungle . By Jove ! The animal has three times the size too ! Socoooooorrrooooo ! Use your flying machine ! Steve ? Steve ? Where are you ? I 'm right here , in the tree in front of her . And you , Venus ? Steve , Matt ... I can not take much more . The radius eat no use . The cat is too big to be affected . Steve , help me ! Hold on , Venus . What 's going on ? Help ! What 's going on here ? Welcome , my friends . Do not be scared . We do not represent danger . No danger , no , no , no . We just want to help us . What 's going on here ? Everything on this planet is three times the size of Earth , right ? Certo , Steve I think this applies to people also by Jupiter ! I 'm a little afraid , Steve . Everything is so big ! Do not worry ma 'am . The Triad of people are peace-loving . We know that you came from another planet and this is the problem we want to help us . Yes . Help us . Yes . Yes , as you want to travel in space but our rockets are still exploding . This is the answer to the giant explosions , Matt . They must have been the Triad rockets . Yeah I think so , Steve . Mas , ahn ... How can we help you , uh , Mr ... Eu sou Graf . And I 'm SNAF . Nice to meet you I 'm Steve Zodiac and my companions are Professor Matic and Venus , PhD in space medicine . Do you have good guys , Earthlings . And we need your help desperately It desperately . We know you are very advanced , in the art of space travel . Please tell us , what 's wrong with our fuel ? Yes , say and please help us . More failures and our government abandon the project space launch . Yeah , we had the same problem . Well , Matt , what do you think ? Well , that 's ... It seems we need fuel as much as them , Steve . Yes , to put the fireball in the air and remember Steve , they saved us from that giant lion . Okay , let me look at this fuel you . You mean ... - Are you going to do ? - Go do ? It seems that help one another is what we do . And we will give you all the help we can . Anything you need . Come on , SNAF . Let 's take a sample of our rocket . Yes , let 's . Well , to giants until they have manners . I think Triad is 100 years behind the Earth in development whether to launch its first rocket into space . I appreciated that you volunteered to help them , Steve . - They are some cute . - Well , if we wanted to escape , we would have a big jump ahead . I was thinking , Steve . We need to go to the Zoonie fast . I did not leave any food for him . Oh , he 'll be fine for now . What worries me is how he 's doing with Robert . I hope you do not leave mad again . I can imagine ... Zoonie will say , " Welcome to Home " Yeah , yeah , and Robert will answer , " Way home " . And Zoonie will replicate , " Welcome to laaar " And so it goes . Yeah , it 's going to be a joke , I bet . Way home ... Welcome to Home ... Way home ... Welcome to Home ... home ... Way home ... Welcome to Home ... You welcome ... home ... Here is rocket fuel . SNAF is bringing equipment that might help you . By Jingo ! Not as strong . Remember , we are tiny compared with you . I 'm sorry , Professor . I ... uh .. had forgotten . Let 's Matt , let 's work on that fuel . Sim , Professor , pense no Zoonie . Yes sir . I think I ... uh ... I found the problem . A base heliodrônica é ... ahn ... very dense . It works in the atmosphere but soon reaching the space without oxygen , Well ... It 's going to space ! And you can ... You can correct the fault , Professor ? Well , now I ... ! I think I can . Ahn ... Steve , bring me that bottle , will you ? Entendido , Matt . I loved those big guys that stand packed for us . And you can bring me a couple of handfuls of this powder , Venus ? Yes , Prof. as soon as they take cover this bottle . The ... Prof. will make a mix sample and then we can produce in quantity , SNAF . Bom , Graf . The correct formula is all we need . Well , we 'll soon be out of here , Steve . Teacher calm . Do not spill . Way home ... The rocket is ready to be fired thanks to our friends from Earth . Thank you , Earth friends . Yes Yes . They did a great job . Now let 's cross our fingers and hope that works . Will , Matt . It 's the same basic formula that we use on Earth . Must work if ever leave here and Zoonie starve . - 10 seconds to launch . - Yes . - Nove . - Sim . - Eight . - Correct . - Seven . - Good boy . Six . Five . Four . Three . Two . A. Zero . Fire ! Fire , he said . It looks good . He came out of the atmosphere . It is in space ! - You did it , Matt ! - This is wonderful . The Triads took their first steps in space exploration . And all thanks to you , three legal babes . Legal babes . How can we reward them ? It 's good to help good people like you . Yes , but there is something that can help . Help fill the Fireball Jr with the new fuel . Oh ... Us ... we expected them to be getting a little more in Triad . Yes , we expected , our government wanted to honor them , for their invaluable services to our planet . It is very nice of you , but understand , we have an animal in orbit and he must be weak from lack of food . Sim . And we have a robot that must be needing to be recharged . So understand , Graf and SNAF , we really need to go . Sure . We understand . But we want you to know that it was a pleasure to meet them and work with you . Sim . And a privilege , Please re-Trad logo . We will always have a " Welcome " warm waiting for you . Okay , Matt . Its fuel work in Trad rocket , I hope it works not Fireball Jr . Waiting for takeoff , Steve . Shoot off rocket now . Goodbye Earth people . Bye , bye ... And thank you ... Yes and come back soon . See you soon . - Ate logo . - Goodbye . Someday we will fly to other worlds , SNAF . Sim graph . Sim . Sim . I hope everyone is friendly as our Earthlings . Ok . I 'll put the Fireball XL5 the way . You check our two pets . Look at them ... I think I tired to argue . Let Zoonie to the lab . You must be hungry . And you need to go to the workshop , Robert . Well , Steve returned to the sector 25 in security , Lieutenant . Yes Sir . That 's a relief . I was worried about them . There is no room for feelings in this service , Lieutenant . Do everything calmly , as I do . Fireball XL5 para Space City . Steve ! Good to hear you , boy ! Are you okay ? We spent anxious moments here ! Sim , Comandante . We are all well and on the way home . Way home . Way home ... Stay the course , Robert . Maintaining the course . Stay the course ... Translation - Neverlost

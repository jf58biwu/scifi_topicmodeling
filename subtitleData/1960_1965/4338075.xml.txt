 [ Wind Whistling ] [ Knocking ] [ Man On Phone ] The admiral just arrived at Dr. Melton 's house . I see . Then there is no longer any doubt . Nelson will now talk Dr. Melton into going with him on the Gulf Stream expedition . This must be stopped at all costs . Phone me the moment the admiral leaves Dr. Melton 's house . Yes , sir . [ Engine Starts ] - He just left . - Very well . Put the telephone plan into effect . - I 'll join you in about two hours . - Yes , sir . There it is . Don 't interrupt your work , dear . It 's the telephone repairman . At this time of night ? Something wrong with the phones ? No , sir . It 's the blizzard . We 're checking out the whole neighborhood . All right , go ahead . If you 've got an extension phone , lady , I 'd like to check that out . Yes . Right this way . There it is . [ Rings ] [ Ringing Continues ] - [ Moans ] - [ Ringing Continues ] [ Coughing ] [ Coughing ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Coughs ] Hello ? Hello ? [ Coughs ] She won 't stir for at least 10 hours . Take him away . [ Man ] Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea . Starring Richard Basehart ... David Hedison . Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea . [ Wind Howling ] Captain , I 've checked Navigation five times in the last hour . They swear up and down we 're right on course . Looks more like the Bering Strait than the Gulf Stream to me . - How far are we from the naval base ? - ETA is 0100 . That 's less than two hours . Hope the admiral 's still up when we dock . If I know the admiral , he 'll be waiting right there on the pier . - You see anything , Kowalski ? - No , sir . But if I spot an iceberg , don 't be surprised . Carry on ! In short , Lee , I 'm flying to Washington in the morning . With luck , I 'll have approval and be back tomorrow night . Can you be ready to put to sea first thing the following morning ? No problem , sir . How about this Washington business ? Do you expect any hitch on that end ? Well , I 've learned never to take anything for granted . We have a pretty good chance , now that Dr. Melton has agreed to come along . Well , we should have . If one of the world 's leading climatologists agrees with your theory ... why shouldn 't Washington ? Yes , Lee . Melton is the key to the entire project . With his help , we 'll find the answer . The right frontal lobe has been circumvented ... and the patient has now been completely programmed ... with information and behavior patterns . We 'll see . How soon can he be revived ? - At once , if you like . - Then do it . Do it ! Oh ! Your scalp will be tender for an hour or so . Don 't worry about it . Dr. Melton ? - Do you know me ? - Frederick Cregar . That 's good . Very good . Let me show you something . You see this , Doctor ? Do you know what it is ? This is a man named Admiral Harriman Nelson . There 's the admiral . What are you going to do , Doctor ? That was very good , Doctor . I must compliment you . Now for the real test . How do I change or give new instructions ? Just record it . Dr. Melton , I order you to kill yourself . Well , well , well . I really must compliment you , Doctor . You 've exceeded my best hopes . I 'd always been told the more intelligent the person , the better the subject . You know , I never really believed that until now . Now , Doctor , you 've done very well . But let 's not be too obvious . Ingenuity ... that 's what we must strive for . You see , Doctor ... Admiral Nelson believes that the climate change ... is caused by a shift in the Gulf Stream . He 's right , by the way . But we mustn 't let him discover the cause of that shift , must we ? Now , uh , what do you suggest we do about that ? Chemicals ? Take all you want . My notes and slides , please . The stuff that was brought from the house . Impregnated with this mixture ... the material becomes more and more unstable ... as atmospheric pressure decreases . Ah . I begin to understand . In higher altitudes , this becomes somewhat dangerous . About 500 feet , it will explode with great force . Good . You know , Doctor , you truly have a remarkable mind . The greater the amount of material we treat ... naturally , the greater the force when it explodes . I see . You better hurry now . You must finish in time so I can get you back home and into bed before your wife wakes up . [ Car Door Shuts ] - Charles ? - Yes , dear ? Oh , I ... I don 't know what 's the matter with me . I slept like I was drugged . I have to go out . [ Yawns ] Now ? Oh , I haven 't even fixed your breakfast . I 'm not hungry . Go back to sleep . Oh , no . I have to ... I have a hair appointment this morning . I should get up , but I 'm so tired . Go back to sleep . - [ Knocking ] - Come in . Good morning . You have a visitor . Dr. Melton . This is quite a surprise . I 'm sorry to bother you this way , Admiral ... but I wanted to catch you before you flew to Washington . - I brought you something I thought you could use . - Oh . What 's this ? Some notes and slides from my various Gulf Stream projects . I didn 't think of it until after you left yesterday ... but it struck me they could come in handy when you tried to sell the project to Washington . I 'm quite sure they will be . It was very thoughtful of you . It 's just about time . You should get started for the air base . - Right . I hate to run off this way , Doctor . - Let me drive you over . - My car is at the pier . - Fine . We can talk on the way . - I 'll get a crewman for this . - No , thanks , Lee . I can manage . Come along , Doctor . Admiral Nelson . Good morning , sir . You can leave with me if you don 't mind flying in a T-33 . - I 'm ferrying one to Washington . - Good . What 's the weather like between here and there ? It 's clear and cold . Never remember seeing snow this far south . Neither does anyone else , Lieutenant . - Sir , could I get you to sign this release , please ? - Yes , of course . Well , I 'll say good-bye now , Doctor . - Thanks for the lift . - My pleasure . - Have a good flight . - I 'll see you this evening . Excuse me , sir . There 's a telephone call for you ... Washington . - Thank you , Corporal . - You can take it at the ready room desk , sir . I 'll take care of your bag and see that it 's stowed aboard , sir . I 'll try not to be too long , Lieutenant . You wanted to see me , Captain ? Read this . The admiral ? The jet took off , climbed to 500 feet and blew up . Has confirmation come from the field yet ? I 'm waiting for confirmation now . Nobody could survive that . - I just don 't believe it . - No , Chip , neither can I. I 've been waiting for you , Doctor . No , your wife is not here . She had an appointment with a hairdresser . I took the liberty of letting myself in . - I 've just come from the airstrip . - Yes , I know . I heard the first news flash over the radio . You did a beautiful job , Doctor . Beautiful . Thank you . And now ... for the final touch . You know what to do with this ? I 'm waiting . - [ Doorbell Rings ] - Stop ! It 's these unexpected little interruptions that give life its flavor . Don 't you agree , Doctor ? I 'll be waiting in the bedroom . [ Doorbell Rings ] - [ Door Closes ] - [ Nelson ] I know you weren 't expecting this visit , Doctor . - I 'll only be a minute or two . - But ... But ... But the airport ... the accident ... That was a terrible thing . It was a close call for me too . The last minute before takeoff , I received a message from Washington ... approving the project ... so I left word for the plane to leave without me . That young pilot never had a chance . O-Oh , you must be badly shaken . Please sit down . Thank you . I ... I 'm afraid I forgot my bag . Your notes are destroyed completely . [ Melton ] Oh-Oh-Oh , that doesn 't matter . Admiral , tell me , what are your plans now ? Why ... Why , to leave on our project at once . You are going , aren 't you ? Yes . Yes , of course I 'll go . Good . We 'll make all preparations at once . [ Door Closes ] Forgive me , gentlemen , if I tell you things you already know ... but even the best-informed people ... tend to think of the Gulf Stream ... as an oceanic river of warm water coursing up the Atlantic Coast . In reality , though , it 's a rather narrow ribbon of fast-moving current ... which acts as a kind of wall ... keeping the warm equatorial waters here ... from mixing with the cold Arctic waters along here . So , naturally , the farther east this dividing wall moves ... the colder the Atlantic Coast of North America becomes . Which is exactly what I believe happened . Something in this area here has caused a slight diversion ... of the direction of the currents . The diversion increases as it moves northward , producing the freak weather . Then our mission is to locate the cause of this diversion and correct it , if possible . Exactly . We 're entering the critical area now . I propose we run submerged for the night to take readings at lower depths . - Aye , sir . Chip , dive the boat . - Aye , aye , sir . Make your depth 200 feet and keep ' er steady . Rig for deep submergence . - Navigation reports for the log , sir . - Ah , thanks , Chief . [ Hissing ] - Sound the fire alarm ! On the double ! - Yes , sir . ! - [ Klaxon Sounding ] - [ Alarm Bell Ringing ] [ Grunting ] Kowalski , get him to sick bay . And break out an inhalator ! Fast ! This is the captain . Surface the boat . And instruct Engineering to clear all ventilators of smoke . [ Alarm Bell Continues Ringing ] Chip , all clear ? What do you make of this , Captain ? Doesn 't make things very pleasant up there , does it ? Down scope . - Crack the deck hatch as soon as we approach the surface . - Aye , aye , sir . [ Coughs ] Any explanation for ... [ Coughs ] how that fire started , Lee ? It was probably some kind of chemical reaction . You must have gotten something from the lab in your clothes ... which ignited by spontaneous combustion . That doesn 't sound very likely . I don 't know how to explain it . - I don 't think you should go up on deck , Admiral . - Doc says I need fresh air . I don 't know a better way to get it . [ Sighs ] Excuse me , sir . Did you say fresh air ? - We 've got tons of dead fish up there . - Dead fish ? Yeah . They were on the deck when we surfaced . I saw them through the scope . They 're floating all over the water . - Curley , get one and bring it down here . - Down here , Admiral ? - One dead fish . - Aye , aye , sir . - Bring it to the lab . I 'll be there . - Aye , aye , sir . [ Clicking ] - Radiation ? - Enough to kill every fish in the area . I 'm beginning to see what our great underwater upheaval must have been . You don 't mean a nuclear explosion . I 'm not sure yet . - Where are your water samples ? - Right here . [ Clicking ] I see nothing in your report about radioactivity , Doctor . Well , uh , I didn 't test for it . The idea never occurred to me . Never occurred to you ? What kind of scientist are you ? How could you make such an idiotic blunder ? It 's inexcusable . May I remind you , Admiral , I 'm a guest and a colleague ... not an employee . Sorry , Doctor . Of course you 're right . The main thing now is to trace this radiation to its source . I 'll get started right away . Doctor , are you all right ? Submarine duty doesn 't agree with some people . No . No , I 'm fine . I 'm just a little tired . Well , don 't work too long . [ Clicking On Speaker ] - The count 's slowing down again . - [ Clicking Continues ] Try her this way . Two degrees left rudder . Come to course 1-5-4 , absolute . [ Clicking Speeds Up ] - Steady as she goes . - Steady as she goes , sir . [ Man On Speaker ] Captain , this is Lookout . Small object bearing 0-7-1 , relative . Range : 1,500 yards . Radar 's been reading the same thing . - Can you make it out ? - Yes , sir . Small marker buoy . Seems to have a whip antenna on top . No identification number . Very well . Keep it under observation . Up scope . Whip antenna . Let 's have a closer look . You know what to do . Under no circumstances are you to stay in the water more than 10 minutes . If the counter goes past the red line , return at once . - Just follow the chain down and report what you find . - Aye , aye , sir . [ Geiger Counter Clicking ] - It doesn 't make sense . - Well , it 's true , sir . That cable goes right straight down into the ocean floor . And the radiation seems to come from that spot ? It sure does , Captain . I checked with the counter . [ Morton On Speaker ] Captain , Sparks is picking up a signal ... an electronic beam . Of course ! That explains the antenna . - Has he got a fix on it ? - The directional finder 's working on it right now , sir . I want a report the instant you locate it . There 's the source of the signal . Coincides exactly with Radar 's report . There 's an island located there . There 's no name though . There are plenty of uninhabited islands in this area , Lee . Let 's get under way . I want to take a look at this place . What about the marker buoy ? We can 't leave it . We 'll just go close enough to put a party ashore , then lay back here again . Admiral Nelson , I protest . We 're wasting time . This has nothing to do with our project . - I don 't agree . Lee , get your men ready . - Aye , sir . Nobody 's home , Captain . I don 't know . The signal comes from here . There must be some sort of installation . There 's something over there , Skipper . [ Crane ] Looks like a shot tower . There are no buildings around . What about in there ? - Come on , let 's see . - No , now , wait a minute . Seagull to Albatross . Seagull to Albatross . - Come in , Albatross . - This is Albatross . Go ahead , Seagull . We 're on shore . No sign of life . No patrols . We spotted what could be a nuclear shot tower , but I 'm not sure . There are some caves around here too . I 'm still investigating . I 'll make a report again . Seagull out . - Follow me . - Yes , sir . [ Man On Speaker ] Stop right where you are . ! You 're covered . Drop your weapons to the ground . Drop it . ! [ Gunshot ] He 's been shot ! He needs help ! [ Man On Speaker ] He needs nothing . Stop . ! You and your party will walk straight ahead , hands in the air . Move . ! Report any further change in your reading at once . There must be no hold in this countdown . [ Man Shouts , Indistinct ] Commander Lee Crane , captain of the submarine Seaview ? And who are you ? The name is Frederick Cregar . Unfortunately , you dropped in at an awkward moment . Awkward ? For you or for me ? [ Man On Radio ] One hour and 40 minutes to zero . I see you 're curious about the countdown . Good . Good . I like a man with a healthy curiosity . What kind of a countdown is this ? It 's part of a series of nuclear tests ... designed to produce a weapons system of unequaled power . The stronger nations ... yours , for one ... frown on such activities among their lesser sister states . Fortunately , they won 't know until too late . I wouldn 't count on that . Oh . Are you thinking of the Seaview and what Admiral Nelson knows ? If they don 't hear from us , they 'll come looking ... and they 'll blast you right off the map , Cregar . My dear Commander , it so happens that at this moment your submarine is poised ... directly above the next bomb we re about to detonate . In exactly one hour and 37 minutes ... Admiral Nelson and the Seaview will simply cease to exist . Skipper , we gotta get a warning to the admiral . How ? They took our shortwave . And I don 't see much chance of busting out of here . - Do you , Captain ? - I 'm afraid not . All we can do is stick it out and wait . After all , we 're not in such bad shape . Except this cave is full ofbugs . Hope you guys don 't mind . Not me , Captain . Nothing wrong with bugs if you leave ' em alone . Yeah , that 's my motto . Stay as far away from them as possible . You and me both , Kowalski . Well , we might as well make ourselves comfortable . Could be here a long , long time . Yeah . I just hope they don 't forget to feed us . [ Whistling ] [ Continues ] - Knock off the whistling , Curley . I wanna get some sleep . - Yes , sir . [ Whispering ] Come on ! Sector four clear . Proceeding to sector five . Out . [ Groans ] Seagull to Albatross . Come in . Yes , this is Albatross . Where have you been ? - Sparks , get me the admiral . - He 's waiting right here . Admiral , listen very carefully . You 've got less than an hour . Get away from that marker buoy . That hole in the ocean floor contains a nuclear bomb ... and you 're sitting right on it . We 'll get under way at once . What are the chances of stopping it ? Very good , if you make straight for the island ... with several missiles prepared to fire . They 'll stop the countdown when they see they 're covered . - Report this to Washington . I 'll get us moving . - I think not , Admiral . Someone was careless enough to leave a small arms locker unattended . I appreciate the favor . That should take care of any radio messages . The Seaview will go nowhere , Admiral ... until the bomb goes off . Admiral , out of my way . Move . Move ! Move . Get out . Get out ! It 's no use now . Before you repair the helm , it 'll be too late for all of you . - But you 'll go with us , Melton . - It doesn 't matter in the least . You 're insane . That doesn 't matter either . [ Gunshot ] - [ Choking , Groaning ] - He 's been hit ! Get him to sick bay ! [ Groaning Continues ] - Engineering , get a repair party on that helm mechanism . - We gotta get out of here . - Can the men aft handle the auxiliary steering ? - Yes , sir , no problem . Get a detail on the auxiliary steering and stand by to get under way . Let 's get moving ! No , no ! Let me go ! [ Grunting ] - How is he ? - It 's just a crease , sir . But he 's out of his head . - No ! No . - What 's this ? I don 't know , sir . We noticed this bandage when we ripped off his shirt . No ! - [ Exhales ] - Adrenaline . [ Beeping ] - [ Beeping Continues ] - So that 's it . We 're at flank speed , sir . What 's that ? This man has been a walking receiving set . - I saw an experiment like this once before . Listen . - [ Beeping Continues ] It works like a heart pacemaker , only it transmits information directly to the brain . With this on him , Melton was little more than a robot . - What 's that signal mean ? - Take this to the recorder . Take the next beep and slow it down . It 's a burst transmission . Wait , wait , wait . - Wait . - No , let him alone . Admiral Nelson . Where am I ? - What happened ? - You 'll be all right . All right ? No . Not all right . Never all right . I 'm beginning to remember . There was a plane ... a jet pilot . I killed him . And I tried to kill you . No . No , you didn 't . You 're no more guilty of murder than a gun is . The guilt belongs to the man who pulled the trigger . [ Sighs ] Admiral , listen to this . [ Cregar ] You have failed me , Doctor . Radar indicates the submarine has not been completely disabled . Now yourjob is even more difficult . Deliver Nelson to my central control . This is imperative . Deliver Nelson to me at once . The man who pulled the trigger . - Oh , if we could only reach him . - We can . Those instructions were meant for your brain . We 'll carry them out . [ Radio : Man # 1 ] No sign of the escaped prisoners in sectors one through six . [ Radio : Man # 2 ] Retrace and keep searching . [ Kowalski ] Captain . ! That 's Dr. Melton with him . Just a few more steps and I 'll pick him off . - No . - No ? You gonna let him take the admiral ? He 's not taking the admiral . Think about it . What chance would Melton have ... taking the admiral off the Seaview past the whole crew ... if he didn 't wanna go ? Come on . Be quiet . I really must apologize , Admiral . This meeting would not have been necessary if your captain hadn 't escaped . Ah . Crane got away , did he ? Good . Well , he won 't get off the island , of course . - Neither will you now . - [ Man On Radio ] Thirty minutes to zero and counting . You see , I am reluctant to put a hold on our countdown . You have , uh , very sophisticated equipment . Thank you . We use it well . However , there is one more shot after this one , the climax to our series . One more . Where 's the bomb ? On a platform right here on this island , ready for immediate activation . This spectacular burst is designed to show the world ... that we have joined the nuclear club . Are there any more questions , sir ? No , I think not . Well , Mr. Cregar ? Doctor , shoot him . Dr. Melton , you have orders . I said for you to shoot Nelson . The bullets in this gun belong to you , Mr. Cregar . All right , up ! Up ! I 'll take that , Doctor . Lee , clear these men out of here . All right , back from there . Come on . ! Move it . ! Admiral , you 're wasting your time . The countdown will continue unless a proper code sequence interrupts it . Get him out . Doctor , you stay with me . Is he telling the truth ? I 'm afraid so . We can 't stop it . But look here . - You see the way it 's set up ? - The same system we use . Exactly . Conventional telemetry . A series of relays activating the firing mechanism . Then we can 't abort it without the code . No . But we can activate the tower bomb to go off at the same time . The whole system was designed to handle both devices . One at a time , normally . They 'd discover it , stop the countdown . Let them . But I doubt it . You see this ? The same controls serve both circuits . They 'd get no signal from their servomechanisms ... if we patch this second group in right along with the first . - I hope you 're right . - We only have a little while to wonder . Guards coming down the passage . Soon you 'll be surrounded . You have no hope of getting off this island . - I advise you to stop the countdown immediately . - Not a chance , Admiral . - Get out of here ! - Curley , take off ! Yes , sir . Follow them ! Follow them ! Chip , take her down and get out of here at flank speed . Aye , sir . Clear the decks . Prepare to dive . All ahead flank . Thank heavens they adapted most of their instrumentation from ours . Will Cregar stop that countdown ? We 'll know in a matter of seconds . - We 're far enough from the island now to ... - [ Explosion ] It checks out . Water temperature , density and salinity constant . The Gulf Stream is just where it should be . Could that last nuclear explosion possibly have done it ? Why not ? I 'm convinced it was the illegal test series that altered it in the first place . - [ Knocking ] - Come . Good news , Admiral . We arrive in Pensacola in two hours . I just got the weather report ... fair and warmer .

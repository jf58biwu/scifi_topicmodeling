 - Ok , Venus ? - Ok , Striving . Right . Come on . As is Hindu , AL ? I do not think I can , Ken . I do not think I can . Vai course , Al . You just have to take it easy . Oh no ! Not again ! I can not stand it anymore . Simply can not stand it anymore ... Calm , Al . Do not let it bother you . We 'll be fine as long as we stay here . Not Ken . We 're stuck . We 'll never get out of here . Not alive , at least . Do not move . Whatever you do , do not make any noise . Try again , Lieutenant , and use the Neutroni transmitter . If there is someone living there , they will respond immediately . Yes Sir . Fireball XL2 , aqui é Space City . Do you hear me ? Exchange . Nothing , Mr. Steve 'll try . No , thanks . This may have been fashionable for a hundred years , but not for me . This is Twi-i-ist . They are still receiving the distress signal ? Yes , Mr. continues from the surface of the planet Monotane . Tenente Ninety , mande para Steve Zodiac . Prepare the Fireball XL5 for immediate launch . Sim , Sr. Ohh , this tire . People should be very pike these days . Meet Steve , can be , please ? Steve Zodic here . I want you here right now . We have an emergency . - Okay , Commander . - What 's wrong , Steve ? We might go on an important mission , Venus , As I said , we lost contact with the XL2 a few hours . And they sent us an emergency broadcast . As you know , Steve , this is an automatic transmission beginning if something is wrong . It is from this site that are broadcasting ? But it is the planet Monotane . That 's it . Prof. Matic is already in Fireball XL5 . He was here when the alert began . How long you will be ready to take off ? What do you think , Venus ? Around an hour ? I think we can , Steve . Ok , in an hour , then . That 's the part that tell me things . We are already underway to Monotane and now just wait . Enjoy good , Steve . My guess is that we will have a lot of action when we get there . Most likely . Hey , Venus , where is your Lazoon ? I hope you do not mind , but Steve put the control booth with Robert . In the control booth with Robert ? Do not worry , they are having a great time together . They spend hours enjoying each other . Red direction 1-6-2-0 . Red direction 1-6-2-0 . Red direction 1-6-2-0 . Red direction 1-6-2-0 . Steve , I wanted to know what the crew the XL2 is doing now . They are just two on a reconnaissance mission . Al Stomper e Ken Johnson . Dois grandes caras . I hope you 're alive . Well Steve , I do not know about you but I 'm going to bed . And me too . I 'm a little busy . I think I will stand more . It 's one of the advantages of being in space . No day or night . So after we go to bed and get up when we will . I should have taken it as a child . Boy , how I hated to go to bed . Well , I need a lot of sleep to keep my beauty . Well , I 'm tired . See you later . And me too . Good night , Steve . Space . One of the most exciting adventures of the man so far . But it can also be dark , mysterious and very lonely . I just hope those guys are OK . Fireball XL5 should contact soon . Check how many calls you made , Lieutenant ? - Five , Sr. - Try again . Fireball XL5 , here is Space city calling . They are listening , Exchange . I do not understand that , Mr. Do not you think ... We could not find anything in this corporation , Lieutenant . I know what you 're thinking . The XL5 had the same fate as the XL2 . Well , maybe . But for now , just keep checking every few minutes . Yes , Mr. Transmitter Neutroni was checked . This , Ten Ninety , is the first sensible thing said today . Space City , here is Fireball XL5 . Are you listening ? It 's about time . Fireball XL5 , Space City aqui . Receiving clearly . I have tried to contact you at the last minute . - Are in trouble ? - Space City , Fireball XL5 here . Not all is well . We are approaching Monotane . Soon we will orbit . We went through a heavy meteor shower for some time . That must have given problems in Neutroni transmitter . All right , Steve . We are relieved to be good . Keep in touch and report as soon as have some news of the XL2 . And tell him : no heroics . Oh , e Steve ... With a message from Zero . : Yeah , I can guess . " Sem heroísmos . " Tell him I 'll be a good boy as ever . Over and out . Well , Mr. they are OK . Of course it is OK ! What did you expect ? Steve Zodiac is the best space pilot we have . Sim , Sr. - And Lieutenant ... - Yes , sir ? And you are the best we have lieutenant . Sim , Sr. We are in orbit . Ready to release the fireball Jr . Robert está na cabine central de controle ?

Space City para Fireball XL5 . With . Zero . Say , Prof. Matic , heard anything from Steve ? No , Commander , nothing for now . The last time he called , He was heading to the other side of Monotane . He has not found anything . Okay , Matt , please call me as soon as hear something . Clear , Commander . Fireball Jr , Prof. Matic chamando . Steve , already found something ? The Com . Zero is a little anxious . Nothing yet . I wanted something to happen , Steve . I do not like it . Steve , they should be . I think we found the XL2 . Keep your eyes open , Venus . It must be around here somewhere . Firm hold , Venus . Something hit us . We 're out of control . Steve , what happened ? What happened ? I do not know Venus , but hold up . We will fall . Ok , we went down . Yes , and integers . But Steve , what hit us ? I do not know . I will call the teacher . Then we can go out and investigate . - Let the ready Jetmoveis , right Venus ? - Okay , Steve Fireball XL5 calling here Fireball Jr . Exchange . No reply . I think that the fall must have damaged the radio . It 's about time Steve call again . I know nothing so far . Venus , see . No one can be out there alive . How terrible ! What is this ? I do not know . It is getting stronger . I am afraid , Steve . It sounds like some kind of electrical storm . But it seems approaching fast . Venus , fast . It has a cave there . We go there before the storm fall . Why do not we go back to the Fireball Jr ? I do not like the sound of that , Venus . It looks like it 's safer this mountain side . Come on . I hope we removed enough . Let 's stop here . Steve , look ! Do not shoot , Steve ! Do not shoot ! Ken . Ken Johnson . Boy , I 'm glad to see you ! Where is Al ? Okay evil , Steve . But what happened ? How did you know we were in that cave ? We did not know , Ken . But something hit us on Fireball Jr . And then we heard the same sound after we landed and ran to shelter in . It is . And we are here . The same happened to us but we had so lucky . We fall . I hate to say this to you , but you have fallen into a trap . What do you mean ? Look at the cave entrance that understand what I mean . Good thing we have a medical space here . - She is beautiful as well . - It is . Al is in good hands . But what is this monster , Ken ? I can not tell you much , Steve . But that he hit the fireball Jr . I hate things that have long neck like skyscrapers . I think we 're safe here but we need arrange a way to escape . I gave him something to ease the pain for now . But we need to go back to the Fireball Jr pretty quickly . Even I left here , of no use the Fireball Jr is not all . Hey , what 's going on ? So far , so good . Look all you want baby , but do not hurt him . Think , Steve , he could break it like an egg . Hey , Venus , contact Professor with the radio Jetmóvel . Tell him to wait right where he is . If that beast destroy the Fireball , we will lose our only hope . Chamando Fireball XL5 . Venus herein . Are you listening to me ? Exchange . He got lucky ? Not yet , Steve . I think the radio is dead . Chamando Steve Zodiac no Fireball Jr . You hear me , Steve ? Exchange . I do not like it . Something must be wrong . I can not answer one of them . It is best to check with Space City . Chamando Space City , Prof. Matic aqui . XL5 . Flae Matthew . Aqui Zero . I 'm getting worried , Commander . I can not Steve 's response on Fireball Jr . They must be having some kind of problem . Well , all you can do is keep trying , Matt . No , I 'm behind them , Commander . No Matthew , you know the regulations . Do not tell me this , Commander . I think you would do the same . Because I remember the pioneers of the time Space when you ... Ok , that 's enough , Matt . Suit yourself . But I know nothing about it , okay ? And between us , Matthew ... - Good luck . - Thank you , Commander . Over and out . Okay , Robert , switch to landing procedure 22-0 code green . I understood . Code 22-0 green . Well , we agreed that the only chance Al should be saved is to reach the fireball . - Right . - Yes . So we need to do is get to the Fireball Jr , unite the Fireball and then destroy the monster . - Right . - Yes . Will this dark side of the planet in a few hours . That 's when I 'll have my best chance . Our best chance . I 'll go with you . I wanted to go too , but I think Steve better to stick with Al . Well , that settled , we might be better we take a nap . We will need all our energies in a few hours . Nothing yet . Hmm ... Now I 'm on the dark side . This makes it difficult to look for . Wait a minute ! There is . Posso ver o Fireball Jr . Robert , land immediately . Position 6-2-0 black . Okay , understood . 6-2-0 accordingly . It is looking ... It looks like a spaceship . Oh , can not be . I must be dreaming . I 'm not understanding anything . The wreckage of Fireball 2 , the Fireball intact Jr and no one around . You have something very strange going on . No , I do not like of this . Eu , er ... I 've got the strange feeling of being watched . Argh ! Help ! Ok , still , do not move . What 's going on ? Oh , he , he , he ... Hi guys . I just went down to see if I could help with anything . Ha , ha , ha ... Not very friendly , right ? Ken , you tried to use the Ray Eat the monster ? Yes , but is not strong enough . Fireball Jr of the probably are . I will get there on foot . And I ? I want to go with you . No Ken , it 's best that you cover me here . If the monster wake up , you shoot him . Perhaps the blind the light long enough that I can . Well , I hope so . But the heavens be careful . So far so good . Oh , Ken , can not stand this . Please Venus , go to the cave . You can not help me or Steve . My leg ! I think I broke my leg ! It 's no use . I can not move . I just can not move . Venus , bring me another Ray Eat , fast . This is failing . Ken , he 's on the run . You are right . I do not understand . See . Look at the Fireball . What happened ? What is happening ? See Teacher . Lazoon , my wonderful Lazoon saved the day . I still do not understand . Well , you know , Lazoons mimic sounds they hear , and the monster obviously thought it was one of his colleagues . and he ran to join them . Well , you better get out of here before he comes back . He will be disappointed when they find out He has no other friends around . Ok , Teacher , you and Venus Al carry to the ship . I 'll get Steve and carry it out of here . I feel a little silly with this cast on my foot . I must appear to be more heroic . I think you 're better than me , Steve . All I see ahead is a meeting with the Com . Zero , for disobeying regulations . Well , I think both are great . Well , let 's face it , The real hero of the day was that his funny Lazoon , Venus . I promise I will not complain about him ever again . Robert , mark course home . Mark course home . Mark course home . Mark course home . Mark course home . Mark course home . Mark course home .

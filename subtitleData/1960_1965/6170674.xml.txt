 - Ok Venus ? - Ok Steve . Right . Come on ! SPACE PIRATES Are you enjoying the book , Jonathan ? Well , it 's kind of old ... Jonathan Zero Jr , this is no way to talk about this one you won . - But he 's old . - Right . Enough . Thanks for taking care of him tonight , Venus . I would not ask but this meeting was important means , I understand Commander . We all know that is not lost to bingo night for nothing ... He , he , well ... It is important to keep up morale in Space City , you know ... Honey , are you coming ? We 're late . I 'm going , my love . Oh well ... Duty calls ... See you later , Venus . Jonathan . - Good night , father . - Good night commander . So Jonathan , do you think the book is kind of old , right ? I thought you 'd like . Adventures and pirates ... Yeah , but everything happens on Earth , I like space adventures . I wish there were pirates in space . - Who said do not exist ? Ok , tell me a story about them . Well right . That 's what I feared . Well , all right . I 'll try . In the depths of space , in sector 2-5 . Hey , it 's Steve Zodiac sector . That 's it . Well , there 's a planet called Minera . This is a rich planet in radioactive minerals . The biggest source of known radioactive minerals . Without these vital minerals , Earth would be doomed . That 's strange ... No point in dreaming about it . We have work to do . The sooner we start , the sooner we will leave . What do you call that planet , Jock ? That ? That 's the planet Aridan , known as desert planet . There ar breathing , but the water has dried completely . Now no one can live there . It would be a perfect place for a hideout for pirates . From there , they could loot the cargo space of the Earth I left the Minera planet . That 's all , Captain Catt ? I hope so . That 's all for now , Patch . A good referral . Oh , it 's a tough way to make a living . Flying through the sky under the symbol of the skull and bones . But do not forget : we are not mere pirates . Our award is the jewel of the universe : A Terra . Do not give me that , Captain ... This distant planet is a desert . Anyone except an astronaut would die of hunger or thirst here . Roasts and drink , is what you think . But soon , the result of their efforts will be when the earth is so in need of atomic ore we can take it only with one hand . Unless or Colonel Zodiac ... Zodiac ! I have a thing for him . You have to admit Steve , things are getting serious . Twenty of our cargo of Minera were attacked Last month . Not only is the load value ... But the radioactive minerals Minera planet , They are vital to Earth . I know that , sir . But things are not desperate . Not yet . Once the Q Nave is ready , will the route of the cargo , The pirates will not notice that it is not a freighter until afternoon . Meanwhile Venus and Matic are working in a substitute for the mineral . Prof. and I think we will have an answer soon . He is working on calculations right now . He will do the magic . Help me test this my trick . It is brand new ! Only until the next stage of my experience be ready . Okay , Prof. but we will fast . Take any letter . Do not show me . I see a letter from low value . Yeah , definitely , I think it 's ... - It is a four . - Continue ... It 's ... ... four of hearts ! Hey ! That 's right ! How did you do ? A magician never explains his tricks . Oh , cats suffering from space ! The experiment ! You 're an old rogue , Professor . Oh no ! Matthew , what have you done now ? I can not turn away for a minute , Er , Venus , eu ... Francamente Professor , You could have done better than that . I would not be laughing if I were you , Lieutenant . I would go to the fastest control room he could . With . Zero is screaming like a Martian hippo looking for you . You were where ? Teacher in the laboratory , Mr. And may I ask what he was doing there ? Practicing magic ? Just invented a trick . Er .. a trick with drink . Not now , sir . We have an urgent work to do . - Just this ... - All right , prof , but fast . Ladies and gentlemen ... , Here I have a glass , and here a jar with colored water . Pour water into the cup ... then ... We have a glass of water , right ? Continue . With my magic wand , hit the glass ... one , twice , three times ... and the colored water disappears ! Okay , Professor ! And to prove the truth of this act of magic , I will turn the glass , down . Professor ! What the hell ... What I have done wrong ? Oh , professor , you really are a fool ! All right , sir . Una final adjustments in the morning and be ready . But it looks like a common freighter . Right , you can trick you , deceive a space pirate . But believe me , she 's well prepared . A perfect ship trap . - Congratulations , Steve . - Thank you , Commander . Thank you , Commander . I 'm actually proud of her . Perhaps Jock stay in Minera while you act as bodyguards . Call him at Neutron transmitter , Lieutenant . Yes commander . Immediately , Commander . Space Patrol calling chief engineer . Chief engineer for space patrol . I 'm ready to leave this hellish planet of robots , Would not you rather wait for us to join you ? The ship disguised as Steve will leave in the morning . That 's an order , Commander ? - Do not Jock , just a suggestion . - So if you do not mind , I 'm on my way . There is no danger . What a pirate would want me ? Jock right , but be careful . Have you met some Scots who were not careful , Commander ? I call him back , Commander ? No , it is not necessary . A great guy that Jock . Tough as it only . Throw it out along with the pilot . They will not survive much on this planet without food and water . A slow and painful death , Captain . Things are going very well . Ohh , oh yeah , captain , of course . Do not you think that Prof. and Venus should go on this mission ? I would Cmdte , but they will be most useful in the laboratory . We still need a replacement for the radioactive ore . Robert and I will give account . Do you need anything else ? All is well , Commander and I look forward to go . The pirates left their ship in free flight . I think they 'll get ours . I can hear the noise of the engines . If I could lay my hands on them ... I left them there , Captain , like a couple of babies . You said that , Patch Twenty times . Ohh , but it was one of the finest work I 've ever done , Mr. But this old ship that we are now , It is heavy and slow as an old space cow . Chap with all respect , I think we should have stayed with our old ship . And Zodiac would have hit us at a time . You heard their conversation on the radio , Patch . He 's Looking our ship . But we will not be there , Captain . Exactly , you old space dog . Zodiac is not the only one to have a ship disguised . Ohh , it is a beautiful trap , Captain . Even I only with an eye can see . All we have to do is wait Zodiac and bring him down . And then ... No sign of Eng , Space yet . - As it is late now ? - More than four hours . Any news of Steve , Commander ? No , we are maintaining silence on the radio , if the space pirates are listening . None ship 's signal pirates . If only we knew where to hide . - Jock is delayed . - What happened ? I wanted to know . Just disappeared . It takes more than a pirate node to keep me imprisoned . Well , now let me release the boy . Hold on , boy . You will be free in an instant . And you and I have a job to do . It is the freighter Jock . He must have been in Space City now ... Something must be wrong . Zodiac calling freighter . Zodiac calling freighter . Can you hear me , Jock ? Jock , do you hear ? Zodiac for freighter . And not getting answers , not resist the temptation to come here , look for yourself . No freighter response . I 'll check . Take care of all Robert . Patch ! Oh , I was just taking another sip of this fantastic water Cap . Calm Patch , may be the last for a long time . Prepare to receive our special visitor . The fearsome Colonel Zodiac . I 'm ready for it . My guess is that Steve Zodiac will come here to investigate any minute now . Just keep looking . There he is ! Welcome to the freighter . It is coming ... - Ready Patch ? - Ready , Captain . He 's at the door now . I 'm ready for it . Jock ! Jock ! Are you there ? Welcome aboard , Steve Zodiac . Hey , what 's going on here ? The water ! The precious water ! He hit with the ray gun ! - It seems all right . - Your dumb ! She was poisoned by radioactive rays . The entire supply will be contaminated . Cont .. .. c ... poisoned ? We die of thirst ! We can not live without water ! Do not panic , you fool . Certainly there will be more on his ship . Let 's go . RÃ¡pido Patch . We need to fill it all . It will take hours . Hey captain ... stopped . It was all water that had there . His great idiot ! You opened all the valves ! One of them poured all the water in space . Now , how would I know that ? Anyway fill one bottle . I suppose it will last until we have other supply . And where do we get more water , Captain ? Let 's send them to Earth seeking more . And that 's it . Send the robot back to Earth with evidence that we have the precious cel . Zodiac as our guest . Tremors space bases ... Now my boy must use ingenuity of engineering . My idea is to use these gas cylinders as a personal jet . Back to Earth . Back to Earth . You 'll get nothing from it . One more word Zodiac and I do walk the plank space . Our firm the starboard bow . - Get ready to land . - Yes , Captain . Ship approaching at 1-6-8-0 Black , Commander . Must be Steve . And it is . See , he is landing . But , er .. No radio message ? It must be some problem . Let 's go talk to him . Pouso completado A-OK . Robert ? But where is Steve ? What is this ? It looks like a letter . Open Venus . It 's a ransom note . - They got to Steve ? - That 's terrible ! - What do they want ? - Water . And our guarantee we are not going after them . If we give them water , how do we know that will release Steve ? Of course I .. I could send a patrol ... No , no commander . We should not do this . They can take revenge on Steve . Er .. Water ... Not exactly a valuable product . Unless you 're a space pirate in Aridan planet . Aridan ? The desert planet ? Not even a magic would create water there . This is it . A magic trick ! Comand . , Venus and I will charge water in the Fireball . And then ? Properly doped ... It will do more than kill their thirst . Ahh ... This water quenches thirst of a subject 's space ... Easy on the water , Patch . Yeah , Patch has calm that this might be his last sip . The water ! I will cut your throat ear to ear ! Wait Patch . Kill our hostage will not do us any good . Now let 's see who is the toughest , hÃ¢ ? Prof. know , I still have doubts about his plan . Well , er .. I confess I 'm a little scared Venus , but we have to try . Well , we hope you have better luck this time with his trick . Well , soon we will know . How far into the desert planet now ? Go to the Control Center and already tell you how far . We are not far away . Er .. O that ? What 's that ? Oh ... A beautiful bottle of booze ... Gone ! Gone ! It was only a mirage , Patch . Just ... a mirage ... Sure ... Oh .. not a mirage ... I can not stand it ! No , this is real , Patch . Oi Venus . Oh , good to see you , Steve . Boy ... It looks like the Death Valley ... No tricks ! Or Colonel Zodiac pay ! They brought the water ? - Here 's a little . - But our ship is full . You flush and delivery in the cel . Zodiac . What do then is your problem . How do I know if the water is not doped ? You drink a little . Sure . Give me a teacher cup , please . " Oh .. give me a teacher cup , please ... " Ohh , it is enjoadinha , right ? Save me from your comments . You see , I 'm still standing . Give me water and keep your distance . In the serve , Patch while I 'll watch the . Oh ... it will be a pleasure , Captain . Two beautiful water mugs out ... Ahh ... Much better ! Mmm ... Nectar ... - Venus , how you did it ? - You know Steve , I drank the magic cup . And it worked ! I 'm glad for that . Well , er ... they do not look so tough now ... The last of the space pirates . Do not be so sure . Look out already . Hello Steve ! Stop the fire ! Is it just me , Jock ! Swinging my structures ! It is the Cap . Jock ! Hello you ! " Hello you , " said Steve . Because he was very happy to see Jock again . Wow , it was a great story . It was true ? This really happened ? Well , Jonathan , I 'll let you decide that . But one thing you can be sure : Now you go to sleep . Ok , Venus , combinado . Thanks for the story . Good evening . Goodnight Jonathan . Good evening . Translation - Neverlost

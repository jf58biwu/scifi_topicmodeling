( GRUNTS ) ( AIR HISSES ) ( HISSING STOPS ) This is Commander Christopher Draper , the Navy of the United States of America , planet Earth . Former co-pilot Mars Gravity Probe 1 . On our third orbit of this planet , we took evasive action to avoid collision with a meteor and were forced into dangerous gravitational pull of Mars . We were forced to abandon ship . As of now , the vehicle frame is still orbiting Mars . Seems to have established gravitational balance . ( AIR HISSES ) ( HISSING STOPS ) We ejected capsule without incident . Colonel Dan McReady ejecting after I did . I 'll set out to look for him tomorrow . From all indications , he should be on the other side of a high range of rocky peaks to the west . Now , my two most difficult problems are air and water . I have , with what 's left in my tank and one reserve cylinder , enough oxygen for , oh , about 60 hours , depending , of course , on how much I exert myself . My first discovery was that the air on Mars is far too thin to support human life . As to water , by severe rationing , I can get by for about 15 days . Course , once my air gives out , water won 't matter . First positive survival point I found a yellow rock . It 's as burnable as some of our poorer grades of coal . Heat 's uneven , but it should make the Martian nights endurable . ( AIR HISSES ) I feel a little bit like Columbus , set down in a strange new land , full of new wonders , new discoveries . It 's a challenge , all right . A challenge to my training . Sometimes challenges can get mighty big . But I 'm gonna stay alive , believe me . That 's for the morale officer .

Breathing , that 's a different story . Moving about , exerting myself , I 've found that I can breathe the air of Mars for about , oh , 12 to 15 minutes , before I need to take air from my tank for a booster . Lying down , asleep , inactive , I can get by for an hour before taking a booster . In this way , with some discomfort , I can conserve my oxygen supply . At the most optimistic appraisal , ... I have 50 or so hours of life left . God willing . ( SIGHS ) The problem is sleeping . If I don 't wake up in time to renew my air supply , it 's hearts and flowers . I 've got to make some kind of alarm device , safeguard myself . ( METAL CLANGS ) Tomorrow , and morning 's only a couple of hours away , I 'm gonna rejoin Mac . Good old Mac .

I keep thinking of Zolphitas , the two survivors on the planet . Yeah , and the weather is against us , But we need to plan carefully , Steve . It will not do if we all are dead , Steve . That weapon Aquafibiano is very powerful . We already know that Fireball Jr windows are not prepared for this . And you can not do anything about this ? Well , I can try , but it will not be easy . But it is our only chance , Prof. Can you Prof. I know you can . Well , you can bet I 'll do my best . You should come with me next time , Venus .

That Aquafibiano would have damaged my ship if we had given him a chance . Aquafibian ? We have not seen any Aquafibiano as we looked his ship . That creature and his race is the reason for the extinction of my people . Only Rald and I managed to escape him , because we found this shelter just in time .

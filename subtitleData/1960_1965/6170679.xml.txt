 - Ok , Venus ? - Ok , Steve . Right . Come on . Hazardous Cargo PLANETA PHAROS MINA CILUVIUM There , Steve . Pharos , the abandoned planet . Ok , Matt Robert is the Control Center ? Yes , Steve . I just saw a light going through . Right Prof. Introduce yourself to the main control . I am preparing the separation of Fireball Jr . We 'll let Robert in orbit . That dark planet . All falling apart . This is what we expected , Venus . Remember , robots miners took each piece of Ciluvium of Pharos years ago . It is now the planet is all pierced by mines that can collapse at any minute I do not want to be walking around when that happens . Hey , look . Right there . Those flowers . They are beautiful . As far as I 'm concerned , they can stay there . Just look at those rocks is enough to come down . Venus , come with me and Matt will explore and come back in an hour . Ok , Steve . As I imagined . Very dangerous . Ok , Venus , we have seen enough . Let 's get out of here . - What do you think , Matt ? - The planet needs to be destroyed . Before collapsing alone . This will be my recommendation . Let 's go back and make reports . Well , I suppose this will be one less planet in the universe . At least there is no life here to worry about . I never thought when we landed , to find o maldito Steve Zodiac . Did you hear what he said ? It goes back to destroy this planet . I heard . That 's perfect . The planet will not be the only thing to be destroyed . Call Space City , Venus . Prepare for landing . All right , Steve . I 'm looking forward to seeing the new Zoonie . It is , I hope it has not caused many problems to With Zero . All right , Lieutenant ? Yes , Mr. XL5 is coming . Not sure where Zoonie is , it is not Sr ? Lieutenant , I am a commander , not a keeper of Lazoons . I can not stand looking at it all day . He 's probably sleeping somewhere . I hope . MOVE UP DANGER Do not just stand there , Lieutenant . Do something ! I want a full report , Lieutenant . Just let me put the hand on who caused this . Oh , oh , look at that mess . I did not want to be in your shoes when the Com . Know this . You stupid , stupid creature . You know when damage caused ? Come back here while I cry with you . But ... but he does not understand , Commander . Stay out of this , Venus . I should pick you up and toss it into space ! Unknown space ... Then he could not do his antics , big man half his mouth . - Son of a ... - Oh , make it stop , Steve . No . This time Zoonie needs to be punished . He needs to learn something . Get him out of here ! I do not want to see him ever again . Come on , Zoonie . Now maybe we can get some work done around here . Okay , Commander , go to the projection room . You need to see the film we made the Pharos planet . Well gentlemen , I agree with you . He must be destroyed . What do you think of missiles ? Well , Commander. with the planet in this condition , missiles would only break it . Yes , I know what you mean . That would close the route of freighters and would take years to clear . Then it must be completely disintegrated . You can use Vesivium Nine . In ... Vesivium ? Vesivium New ? What is it , Professor ? This is the most explosive force in the universe . Exactly . That is why the planet disintegrate . And from what I said , no time to lose . VESIVIUM NINE DANGER Oh , Zoonie , you need to behave . If they want to come out of Space city , I can not help it . And I could not bear to lose you , Zoonie . Oh , Steve. and you . Please let us take Zoonie . O quê ? You can not be wanting him to be jumping in our charge . But it will not create problems , Steve . Please . Please , Steve . I can not leave you with the Commander , you know . Right . You can not leave him with the Commander . And I say more , can not bring it aboard Fireball well . Oh ... Oh , you ... you beast ! I think it will not matter to have two beasts aboard Fireball . Sure , it may come . But on my terms .

Maintaining the course . Posso ir ver o Zoonie , Steve ? Okay , just do not let him leave . I 'll see how Matt is going . VESIVIUM NINE DANGER Ahhh ! What is this ? Now calm down Matthew Matic . This is not the time to go crazy . You welcome ... You welcome ... Zoonie , my poor Zoonie . Hey , do not make so much noise . Teacher calm . This does not blow up until activated . Well Maybe . But why did that for that here ? So you could take care of it . - Do not worry , Matt , it 's ... - Steve ! - Do not move . - What is wrong ? You are carrying a ray gun . There is no danger . The capsule ... that ray gun . Explosive . Only if it is removed . Seriously , Matt , wanted to calm down . Welcome , Colonel Zodiac . What do we do now ? First let 's see how he plans to blow up the planet . Sim . We must find a way ... to keep them here . Okay , let 's unload it . Which will put you , Steve ? I found the place on the last tour here . In one of the mines . Yes , everything is ok . But it is slow work . XL5 chamando Space City . Coronel Zodiac chamando . Zero hour for the explosion least 1600 hours . Message understood . I will divert the traffic space . Entrendido . Over and out . Steve , I can drop the Zoonie now ? Well , I think that 's fine . But under no circumstances should he leave the ship . The pump them ready . Now we must wait for Steve Zodiac and the beautiful Terran . And then ... Nada want ... Not bad at all . Now Zoonie , you need to wait here with Robert . You understand ? And please ... please be nice . - Let 's Venus . Matt expected . - I 'm coming , Steve . Steve , do you think I have time to reap some of those beautiful flowers ? Okay , Matt . Set it for an hour from now . That should be enough for us to be safe . Okay , Steve . She is ready . Nothing can stop it now . What is it , Steve ? It looks like a rock dropped . The entrance is locked . Oh , Steve . What can we do ? Our plans are working . They will never escape . Come on . Let 's get out of here while there is time . Back to our spaceship . Not long ago , Steve . Sim , sim , eu sei . But there must be some way to get out . There must be . They have already gone out , Lieutenant . This should be the answer . As the instruments , the XL5 is still on the planet . I 'll call you again , Mr. Space City chamando XL5 . Space City chamando XL5 . Stuck here , we need not wait for the bomb . We will be buried before . Only missing 45 minutes , Steve . It has some way to stop this thing ? Sem chance . He is as prepared for 1600 hours . If I touch her , explode immediately . Oh , Steve , I 'm afraid . And poor little Zoonie and Robert . Well , it will not make much difference to Robert . Robert ? That 's it ! This may be the answer . What do you mean , Steve ? I do not understand . I can bring it here using the radio of jatomóvel . It can open the way for us . It 's risky , but it 's better than not doing anything . Robert . Robert . Listen carefully . You will get a personal jet and let the XL5 . Take a personal jet and leave XL5 . Take the radio with you and wait for further instructions . Let 's hope it works , Steve . Yes . Take a jatomóvel , Matt and listen Robert . Leave the XL5 . Robert should now be on the surface . I will call you . Robert . You will follow now towards Direction 1-8-9-0 white . Fulfilled orders . He 's here , Steve . - Possession hear it outside . - Okay , Matt . Now , Robert ... move the stone . Mover a pedra . Mover a pedra . Steve , it 's no use . It is like asking a man to move a mountain . Certo , Robert . Times or XL5 . But Steve , Robert is our last chance . Only missing 20 minutes . They should get out of there at 15 : 30 Lieutenant . Otherwise , the Fireball will not be safe from the explosion . Sim , Sr. Boy , if they escape this , I even forgive the Zoonie . Calling XL5 . Calling XL5 . Ten minutes and everything will be over . Oh , Steve . Hey , Steve , you 're carrying a ray gun . Do not start again , Matt . Ma ... but the capsule it is highly explosive . Only if we take the gun . Hey , of course . You 're right , Matt . If I remove the cap , it will explode and open the passage . Be careful , Steve . These atomic capsules may explode only touch of them . In our situation , there is no time to lose . Ok . Steve , we only have six minutes . Vamos , explode . - You did it ! - Let 's get out of here . Top speed , Robert . Maximum speed . Zoonie ! Zoonie , where are you ? We are fora range . Three minutes to zero . Zoonie ! Zoonie ! One minute . Steve , do not think the Zoonie anywhere . Do not worry . He must be on board somewhere . - But he 's not . - Well , he should not have left . Unless .. unless you have followed Robert . Oh ! Oh , Steve . He must still be on the planet . We have to go back to get it , Steve . How can we ? There are only 10 seconds . Zoonie ! Oh , Zoonie ! Stay the course , Robert . Maintaining the course . Heard ... heard this , Sr ? Zoonie was on the planet . Of course I heard . Take control , Lieutenant . And think about everything I said to that poor Lazoon . Is there anything I can do , Venus ? No . No , nothing . We are ... we are sad as you . He was part of our world . Oh , I still think I can hear his voice . I feel like he was in this room with me . Hello everybody . Zoonie ! Oh , Zoonie ! One of those beautiful flowers . You picked me . You welcome !

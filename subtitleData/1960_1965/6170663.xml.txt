It is that AT machine as a baby . Well yet . Without it , we could never colonize the New Earth anyway . We would not have enough oxygen pills for all . Such a beautiful planet , rich in all , no air to breathe . And ... with very low gravity well . Remember . No problem . Once the plant reaches the atmosphere , it will not be to have the densification project the severity coming . Meanwhile keep your boots ready . Ooh ! My feet are already killing me .

Launch least four minutes , Lieutenant . Understood Commander . Gee , is tight here . It is , Ninety . This is one of the risks of being a controller . Sit back and be quiet . Fireball XL5 to control . Asking permission to take off . All systems are green , Commander . Right Steve . Authorized takeoff . See you in space , Steve . Okay . We 'll be waiting for you . OK takeoff , Commander Zero . Towards the point of observation 2-4-1 Blue . Entendido Steve . Cut the launcher . Steve . We 're outside the Earth 's atmosphere and close to the observation point .

We need to stay on the Lieutenant to continue observation . Certo Steve . A cápsula de Ninety está no curso 9-2-7-0 Verde . Rota da órbita lunar . Second stage leaving Steve . My , er ... it 's hot here . And this lack weight is strange . A little different from the Fireball and his artificial gravity . The pulse of Lieutenant is rapidly increasing , Steve . But nothing to cause alarm in time . Approaching the lunar area , Steve . Get ready to enter the moon 's orbit , Lieutenant . Steve , the pulse of Lieutenant is too high . Something must be wrong with the capsule . Tenente Ninety . Make a check on all systems . All indicate green , Steve , Everything seems to be fine . Entering orbit the moon now , Last stage leaving . Lieutenant is going well in my opinion . An orbit should be sufficient . I agree Steve . Outside the temperature increase in their body , it has proven it can withstand the psychological stress , of being completely alone in space . Cut the engines of the capsule , Lieutenant . You will need to stop all fuel in lunar orbit and for the return trip to Earth . Steve understood . Engines off . Completed orbit , Venus . I bet Lieutenant is on track to receive their spatial boundaries . Yes Steve . Its temperature also fell . After turning off the engines . It may have been , er .. a super heating , but nothing serious . I would have triggered the alarm . I hope you 're cert , Matt . Okay , Lieutenant , that 's it . Get out of lunar orbit . Entendido Steve . Firing the main engines in the space time 21102 . Six seconds . Five , four ... three , two ... one ... Fire ! She is heating up again , Steve . And there 's smoke . Steve ! The capsule is on fire ! Do not panic . Matt , what may have happened ? The reactor should be loose . But it should continue operating or alarm would have triggered . The capsule is out of control . I 'm gaining fast speed . Fast even , Steve . Shoot the main rockets or lose , The engines went crazy ! I will burn ! Download Lt. fuel download fuel now . We will achieve it . The radio ... We are failing . Hello Colonel Zodiac . You hear ? Matt , Venus . We lost contact with the capsule . The radio Lieutenant Ninety must have spoiled . And my contact with the Ten Ninety is failing too , Steve . This is serious , Steve . We do not know what 's going on with him . ... I have to get out of here . Need ... put the rescue equipment . Follow the capsule . We will try to save him . It is out of reach . Wait ! I found him . Go to ... Yellow 7-2-2-0 . Understood . Maximum power , the main engines . Matt , the capsule is slower . The ten . It should be ejected fuel . Prepare meu traje espacial , Venus . Okay , Steve . I 'll meet you in the lock . Follow capsule . Follow capsule . Ok , eject . Be careful , Steve . Steve , are you okay ? Yes Venus . I think ... But Lieutenant Ninety ... he had no chance , Returning to Earth , Matt . You can mark the course ? Yes Steve , that ... You know it was an accident . You can not blame yourself . Maybe not , Matt . But I wonder if Lieutenant The capsule was ready for testing . We all know that was Steve . He won their spatial currency before ... from . Oh , Steve . How terrible . He was a nice guy . Of course it was , Venus . Somebody better talk to the Commander Zero . I speak . We do . It will not be easy . I tried to reach it . I know , Steve . Needless to say . The Lieutenant was the best assistant I 've ever had . Yes , he would have been a great driver . I think the Space Patrol lost a good man . You better get down now , Steve . We need to open an investigation . Clear , Commander . We are on the way . Only left an oxygen pill . You will never find me in time . I think it 's the end . Maybe I should have waited in the capsule than jumping into space without the jet pack . Hey Steve , I , er ... I 'm picking up something strange in Espaçomógrafo . Ok , Matt . I think it has something . Let 's check . It should not be long now . But I ... I conquered my currency . I hope they remember me there on Earth . .. They were a cool crowd to work . Em Space City . Already managed to identify the signal , Matt ? Er .. not Steve . But , er ... There 's definitely something there . At deriva . Steve , it 's ... - You 're a man ! - What ? Yes ! , Yes , you 're right . It can be ... Sim ! It Lt. Ninety ! Venus , portable jets and oxygen masks for the gate . Is fast ! Give it oxygen level 5 logo it appears , Steve . Right . 5 . Ejecting level . Wait , Lieutenant . Well , I think that 's rightfully his , Lieutenant Ninety . Gosh ! My Currency Astronaut ! Congratulations , Lieutenant Ninety . Good guy , Ninety . You gave a show . You really the won . Yeah , I never doubted for a moment , Lieutenant . But as I said before , do not let it go to his head . As an astronaut Steve faces dangers every day . You know , Com . For the first time think that he did not hear anything I said . Astronauta Ninety ... the Space Patrol . Translation - Neverlost

 - Ok , Venus ? - Ok , Steve . Okay , come on . Here is Kanerick , their leader , calling the people of Kemble . Soon you will be able to leave their underground caves and live in luxury . I made my plans and the Olympus logo will be our planet . SPACE VACATION A few more days my son , and will be the feast of her birthday . Yes , Father . Kenerick , head of Kemble planet , will come to the peace talks . And there will be no more wars among us . I will see to it that they never return . But there is room for it here , Father . Your planet is terrible , almost impossible to live . You 're too young to understand . If we let Kanerick live here , all kinds of space creatures want to invade vai our beautiful planet . At the birthday party , a bomb placed under his chair , It will put an end to their ambitions . But Father , no one deserves to live in the dark planet Kemble . It is a horrible place . Elixir da Vida . Just laughing . A potion that will bring death to Ergon ... in three short hours ... ... Okay , Lieutenant , can take now . - Yes , Mr. Leave it with me . - I hope so . I will be with Colonel Zodiac . I want to talk to him before he go on holiday . Say wish you good rest , Commander . I will , Lieutenant . I mean that still left something out it ? Even the fireball does not take off with it all on board . I thought it would be a short trip . Mas Steve , Oh , who can be now ? Women . I 'll never understand them . Only I jumped up to say goodbye , Steve 's there ? Inside , Commander . Hello , Steve . Matt . Hey , what 's going on here ? You are emigrating or something ? No , it 's just the idea that Venus has a quick trip . Do not have a left freighter , it is not Sr ? Now look : all year dress uniform . These are my vacation and I wear the clothes more feminine you can . So , I do not want any more comment . Well children , enjoy your vacation and forget the duties . It was nice to have let us use the Fireball for the ride . Well , you should deliver spare parts at Station 6 , then there is no reason not to go to Olympus with him . I heard that there is a place is amazing , Steve Yeah , I saw him once when I started the Space Patrol . And always I wanted to go back ever since . Do not get into trouble , Steve . There were disagreements between Kemble and Olympus for generations . This does not concern us . This visit is not official . All systems are ready to go . All systems here are released . Our guest arrived , my son . He hardly knows what to expect . But Father , there is no other way ? Let me explain , my son . I just have the good of my people in my heart . Greetings Jankel . And congratulations on the anniversary of his son , Ergon Welcome to Olympus planet . You are our guest of honor . Well , what about that ? Another bite . I would say that we 're near the Olympus planet . Professor gave no new course changes . - What is our position , Matt ? - Er ... position ? - Er ... - Are you checking ? Of course I 'm checking . What do you think I 'm doing ? - How many have you got ? - 14 , I think ... er ... that is ... You will get tired of fishing when we get there , Matt . Yeah , but it would be a good idea before we land . Robert is already in the Control Center . We are already arriving in orbit , Steve . Shoot retro . This is the most beautiful planet I 've ever seen , Steve . It 's all that was said ... and more . Well , you 'd better find our host , Jenkel . I think he should be making preparations for the party . The pump is ready . Kanerick going to sit here alone and then bang ! I am delighted to welcome them here . But where is your teacher friend , Steve Zodiac ? Sorry for the delay , folks . I was exploring the planet . Por favor sente-se , Professor . Oh , no , no , no , not in that chair , Teacher In this way , please . This is reserved for our honored guest , Kanerick It is our custom that the guest of honor feel alone . Be sure that Matt does not cause problems with it . Ah , there you are , Kanerick . Please take its place of honor at the head of the table . A special chair for a special guest . Gee , one of the best meals I 've ever eaten recently . Yes , and these exotic fruits . Might take the Elixir Life that Kanerick brought to my birthday , Father ? Please enable him to make , Jankel . The magical contents of the bottle will provide you a long and happy life . Very well . A toast to Ergon for her birthday . A long and happy life . Happy birthday , Ergon . - What 's going on ? - Er ... I ... I 'm dizzy ... Me ... my son ... What 's wrong ? - Probably the agitation . - I 'll get a calming him . My ship is closer , Venus . We can go there to search . Oh ... oh , obrigado . Now ... between . - But I do not ... - Do not argue . I poisoned Ergon and it 's all part of my plan . And I do not intend to let you ruin it . - He does not look very well . - My poor son . My poor son . That 's the ship Kanerick . He is taking off . It looks like he 's going back to his planet . Or Venus sign as well . Hey ! She must be on board . Let me take a look at this " Elixir of Life . " Mm .. It smells like almonds as cyanide . I need to make sure Venus . You need to go rescue his doctor otherwise my son dies . I should have known Kanerick not trusted . Yeah , I understand . It seems there is not much difference between you . Já basta , Steve Zodiac . Rescue spatial doctor and save my son . If it fails and Ergon die , Professor dies too . Move this ray gun . Venus will save anyway and try to save his son , but the prof. go with me . Luckily came on vacation to fish without their ray guns . Then you will do as I say . The teacher is here and Ergon die , he dies too . Good luck , Steve . You have three lives in their hands . - It 's hot , Lieutenant . - It is . I wanted to be with Colonel Zodiac right now . I could take a vacation . I can even see Professor now , just shade and fresh water ... Now only left him three hours of waiting , Professor . Zodiac should be back by then . I hope for his fate he is . It would have helped anyway . I did not need it . This proves that I mean it . If it fails , you die with my son . The arrow will be shot in three hours . Ah , it seems that the holidays are over . I hope that Venus is ok . I have to get her away from her friends . But you will leave Ergon die ? It all depends on which agreement I made with your father . I 'll call him on the radio now that you have time to think . Here is Kemble Olympus calling . Kemble chamando Olympus . Olympus para Kemble . I 'm getting you . You swore to respect the truce . Respect the truce ? And you ? I was smart enough to notice a bomb under my chair . Well , what to do ? Your child will die . I have the Earth 's doctor here . I 'll take you back when you accept my people take the Olympus Control I never accept . And I 'm not beaten yet , are you listening ? I 'm not beaten yet ! Time is passing fast , Professor . It is very fast . His life is in the hands of Steve Zodiac . There you go . Now find Venus . If he wants to go back in time , By this time he may have found the doctor . If they come back too late , I 'll kill them both . Find Venus here can take hours . I can see a light down there . Better check . It is some kind of input , but as I get there ? What Jenkel mean ? He said he is not defeated yet . Maybe he has a antíodoto to poison you gave . No , that 's impossible . The antidote is only achieved in mosses born here . I 'll talk to him again . How lucky . It should work automatically . Steve ... Kemble chamando Olympus . Kemble chamando Olympus . Kemble chamando Olympus . Kemble chamando Olymp ... Argh ! - Steve , where 's Matt ? - Is serving as a hostage . If you do not return in time to save Ergon , Matt dies . How long do we have ? One hour . Rápido Steve , My son . My poor Ergon . He 's getting weaker . Do not worry . Steve will get . ... I hope . Prepare for takeoff . - All systems green . - Right . What happened ? Lightning hit one of the engines . It will reduce our speed , Steve ? I think so , but we have to continue anyway . Come Fireball , do not have much time . His friends deserted us , Professor . Oh well . Now they are missing a few seconds . Really sorry , Teacher , Because his death means that I will lose my son . - Cuide de Ergon , Venus . - Certo , Steve . You did it ! Please save my son . First , let 's take Professor here . Ohh , wow ! I was almost caught . Let 's not forget , Colonel Zodiac . His son Ergon said there is room for his people in Olympus . Listen to him . He has more sense than you two together . Sim , Coronel . Well , it 's good to be among friends again . Your betrayal ! Cigarette ? Well , our quiet holiday were shaken . Think Kanerick Jankel and will maintain peace , Steve ? Your guess is as good as mine , Venus . This is the life , huh ? This is for his play on the weapon . Spatial charges . Your lizard Olympiano . Your chicken Kembleriano . - You think I trust you ? - You talking about trust ? Fighting again ? I 'll call Steve Zodiac . Fighting ? Of course we are not fighting . What did you get that idea ? - In fact ... - We are great friends . Translation - Neverlost

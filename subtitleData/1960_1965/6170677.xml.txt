 - Ok , Venus ? Ok , Steve . Right . Come on . ROBERT FOR REDEMPTION Why Matt is not here ? He continues not contemplating the stars , right ? Temo que sim , Venus . He built a new telescope , you know . Gosh ! What he will invent next ? He spends most of his time traveling the universe . and then he chooses as a hobby astronomy . Well , you know Professor ... Yes , but I think I 'll never get used with their crazy ideas . Sim ! Very interesting . Fish spatial jumpers ! It has an orbiting Lazoon ! Hello everybody ! Welcome ! Zoonie , get down here right now ! Now go bother to Venus I have important research to do . Ha ! Now I may have some peace . Hmm , strange . That planet is not on the map . No , definitely not appear . There ! Best report to the Commander zero . It looks like I found a new planet . Maybe they put my name on it . Planeta Matic ! Planet Matic ? About what he 's talking , Professor ? Think it had been clear . I found a new planet with my telescope . Now see , if this is some kind of joke ... A joke ? With . Zero , you are talking with a qualified astronomer . - Excuse me , Mr. - What is that , Lieutenant ? I could do a check by radar . Professor may be right . Of course I 'm right ! Make the check , Lieutenant . Wait a minute ! I give the orders here , Teacher ! Make the check , Lieutenant , Matic The planet is in ... er in the sector 12 . Direction 4-1-7-0 Blue . Sector 12 ... Direction 4-1-7-0 Blue . Here it is ! But there 's nothing new there . No Planet Matic . I can not understand . I was there . Probably one sujeirinha the lens . Er ... no , er ... . Commander . I 'm sure I saw him . Well , is not there now . You go back to his observatory and let us get back to work . But definitely I saw this new planet , Steve , Well , but you said Com . Zero did not think anything on the radar . Well , it should be defective . There is nothing wrong with my telescope . Claro , Professor . The radar , which cost $ 100 million must be wrong and his telescope $ 10're right . Very funny ! Anyway , Venus and I are going to the movies . Then we talked about it . Then we see the Professor . There must be someone I can talk to . And there , right in front of my eyes , I could see it . A new , unknown planet . And I decided to call it Planet Matic . The great astronomer who discovered the name , Well , what about that ? Welcome ... The instruments do not record anything , Mr. There eclipsing planet Earth . But just take a look out the window , I can see you . Hey Lieutenant , this thing that is blocked the sun must be the planet Matic . No planet , huh ? Well , what you say now , Commander ? Ok , ok . There is a new planet . But we can not capture it with the instruments , Professor . I just do not understand . Well , er ... as I say . There is always to use a good old telescope . Er .. it 's there , is not it ? Not Commander ? Perhaps . But there 's something funny going on . Contact the Zodiac Colonel , Lieutenant . I 'll have XL5 to investigate . A perfect takeoff , Steve . Thank you , Venus . Robert takes over now . Stay the course , Robert . Maintaining the course . Maintaining the course . You know , I think we do not give the value that Robert deserves . The way he always keeps his orders . He was made for this , Venus . If you have him do something , he just for when you 're done . That 's weird . No sign of him in Astroscópio . But he 's right there . Oh , Professor . We were going for coffee . Listen Steve , Venus . There is something very wrong . The planet whatever it is , just It can not be picked up by our instruments . The same problem that the Commander had ? We 'll have to stay in visual control . Yeah , I think so . But it is certain that something strange is happening . What about that , Matt ? This is ... it 's fantastic ! Um planeta artificial ! Greater than anything we could do on Earth Means that there must be some form of life there . If you are well smart to fool our equipment . They do not seem to be so . - In return for the Fireball . - Yes , Steve . The Com . Zero awaits our report . Keep fluctuation . Well , we have a problem . There is no oxygen or gravity down there . And there 's someone in that planet . Who or what , we do not know . Well and now , Steve ? Keep flutuaçãããã ... .. Steve , there 's something wrong with Robert . Hey , Fireball is off course . It is pulled by the planet . Steve , our speed is increasing . Prepare to fire retro . Five , four , three , two , one , fire ! - It 's not working , Steve ! - We 'll hit ! That 's it ! - We lost contact with them , Mr. - What do we lose contact ? Well , I had them sign OK , but the next second , they are gone . It seems to have nothing outside . Do not be fooled , Venus . Let 's take a look . It is the only way to find something . Steve ! See ! Come on . Come on , Matt , Here 's severity . We can walk . It 's just a runner . But there is another door at the end . Use your jets , Gravity is gone again . What do you think of this hallway , Steve ? Nothing yet , Teacher , but give me a break . Something tells me we 'll find something . Let 's try this . We do not want prisoners to the people of Earth . But we found our planet , then we have no choice . Prisoners , is it ? We shall soon see about that . Your ray gun is useless , Earthman . The runner who crossed , It is our disarmament camera . It destroys the mechanism of all weapons . You wait here while the future of you is decided . You can not escape . There is an invisible wall around you . - An invisible wall ? - Nonsense ! Invisible wall ! - Steve ... - Sim , Matt . Er , there is an invisible wall around us . Can you see such a planet Matic , Sr ? I 'm afraid not , Lieutenant . He is gone . If the XL5 landed on it , we lose them . Our instrument simply can not find him . So this is the spaceship of earthlings . I 'll have to destroy it in due course . Let 's put this creature with the others . What will happen to us , Steve ? I do not know , Venus . How about that , Matt ? Well , I think ... that the ball heads built this planet to make them secure . No need to worry about outside interference other creatures in the universe . He brought his mechanic friend to join us . What happens now ? I will destroy their connection with the Earth . You are the first beings who have discovered our planet . And to keep our secret , we can not let them go . We can , however. making them one of us . Your Earth memories will be removed . Will be happy in our company on this planet . You two , come with me . You stay where you are . Cuide dela , Matt . I can not move . Hey , that 's better . Well , just the two of us , Robert . Somehow , I think I underestimated you . Here . TREATMENT ROOM Robert , I will give you the most important order received . Be sure you understand . I understood . Seis keVs . Eight keVs . Nove KEVS . Total . That should be enough . This will make them obey orders . Say their names . Tell me about Earth . Earth ? What is Earth ? Venus , are you okay ? Venus ? Why are you calling me that ? But me , Steve . You 're wasting your time , Terran . Venus is now one of us . As you will . What should I do with the mechanical man ? Mmm , well , it 's done with ladinium . It can be used in the planet engines as a fuel . Push it to the side to the furnace conveyor . XL5 and take the crew to Earth . Come with us ! TREATMENT ROOM - A keV . - It will not take long . Just relax . Will not keep us here . I took steps to deal with it . Two keVs . Cinco keVs . Seis keVs . Nove KEVS . Total . Have you seen the Fireball XL5 ? Er ... I do not understand . Good . Welcome to your new home . He explained to them how it will be your new life ? Sim . We will not have problems with them , Proton . So I think we should get some sleep . I go to my room now . - Good evening . - Good evening , er ... Forgive me , I do not know his name . No EU . I have not said . Follow me to the XL5 . O XL5 ? About what this mechanical man talking about ? Do not discuss orders . We must obey them . Sure . We must obey . We must obey . Personal jets . Personal jets . Where are we being taken ? Way home But we 're home . Comandante Zero ! XL5 reappeared on the radar screen ! Well , do not get to there , man ! - Call them ! - Yes , sir ! Space City para XL5 . Space City para XL5 . Space City para XL5 ! Please respond . Exchange . The people of Earth escaped ! Then we must leave this galaxy forever . Your memories will return soon now that they are out of our influence . But they never remember anything that happened to them , while they were inside the planet . Come on . Let 's get out of here immediately . Space city para Fireball XL5 . Please can answer ? Huh ? Hey , Space City is calling . You better answer . Professor , what are we doing sitting on the floor ? Hum ? I mean , I ... I do not know , Venus . I feel like ... as if asleep . Space city , aqui é Fireball XL5 . Good to hear you , Steve . Now , you tell me what 's going on ? I wonder , Commander Zero . I 'll call back when we understand everything . I do not understand . Just do not understand . I do not understand . Just do not understand . But there was a planet . I know there was . But there 's no sign of him now . I looked into space with the naked eye and saw nothing as well . Well gentlemen , I feel to say this , but I think we suffer from a severe case spatial hallucination . In other words , it never really happened at all . Or it happened ? Lead to XL5 crew home .

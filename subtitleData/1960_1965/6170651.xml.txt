 - Ok , Venus ? - Ok , Steve . Okay , come on . Jury robots , as you consider the prisoners ? Guilty or innocent ? Guilty . Guilty . TRIAL BY ROBOTS What a mess . The last robot disappeared on May 27 , we are already in August and we still have no answer . Let me get this straight , Commander Zero . Four planets reported that their best robots They disappeared in the air . All right , Steve . They disappeared without a trace . The governments of these planets are demanding action . But we can not act clueless . Yes . And where would these robots , and why ? That 's what I do not know , Steve . Oh , hello Matt . We were talking about the missing robot . Do you have any theories ? Maybe we should ask Dr. Al Himber . The expert in robots ? Why ask him ? Well , it may be a coincidence but in his recent lecture tour , in each of the planets visited a robot disappeared . That 's interesting . He arrives for a lecture in Space City tonight . I think this requires a plan of action , gentlemen . DO NOT DISTURB O alarme está pronto , Steve . Only lack secure it in the Robert circuit . Steve , really think that Dr. Himber Robert will try to steal ? Well , look this way , Venus . We suspect that he took the four robots , and they were the best of each planet . Well , Robert is the best Earth robot , then he 'll try to steal it . I see . And the alarm Matt will let us know . But how do you think he 'll do it ? Well , that we do not know , Venus . But remember that he is a genius with robots . If anyone can do it , he can , Conference room And in conclusion , I would like to say how much I admire the work de seu Professor Matthew Matic . In fact , I would say more about the invention of Prof. Matic , known by aficionados as Robert , the robot . perhaps one of the best mechanical creations of the modern world . Prof. A. Himber DO NOT DISTURB What a beautiful creation . Soon it will be mine . Now , put my plan into operation . Wait . What is this ? What fools . Zodiac and Matic think I 'm as primitive as they ? An alarm system . Francamente , Professor Matic , you could do better than this . The ship Prof. Himber already took off , Commander . Understood , Lieutenant . Well Steve , I think we can eliminate Prof. Himber . O Robert está Ok . Yes , I think we should go back to the beginning . With no clue of these robots missing . Let 's go back to the control room . Well Steve , you 'd better get back to our previous procedure . Ten . Ninety , alerte a tripulação do XL1 . It is the next ship on patrol . Send our ships to search for missing robot will get us nowhere . Steve , there are certain cases where these routines and I am following these routines . XL1 ready to take off , Lieutenant . Commander understood . Launch area , XL1 can proceed release process . XL1 in position , Commander . Ok , Tenente . Robert ? We need to stop it . I will use the controls your desk , Commander . Claro , Professor . What is wrong ? The control is working but Robert does not respond . Turn off the control , Matt . He is exploding the head of Robert . It should be obeying a fixed schedule . But how ? It is looking like we were right about Dr. Himber . He must have mistaken your alarm system . Yeah , that must be it . He took your system and put the other to take the robot . Yes of course . And control did not begin until Himber be away in space . I think Robert can help us solve this mystery . Hey , hey , he 's going to the launch pad . Yes , yes , as I imagined . It seems that he is obeying orders to leave with the XL1 . Check the crawler , Matt . Hopefully Himber have forgotten . Ok , Steve . Está funcionando . Right . As soon as the XL1 has left the launch pad , we will prepare the Fireball XL5 and trace Robert . Fireball XL5 prepare for release . Understood Commander . Full emergency . Full emergency . XL5 requires immediate departure . The signal is reaching the XL5 Robert , Matt ? Está sim , Steve . 2-9-5-0 Blue Course . Here we go , Venus . How far did the Robert signal reaches ? We can not lose it . It is Venus . We better be prepared for a long flight , I think Himber would not be so foolish as to keep the robots stolen on a nearby planet . Call Space City and inform our position on Earth . Ok , Steve . XL5 para Space City . Answer please . Answer . O radio parece inoperante , Steve . - You 'll see , Matt ? - All right , Steve . Hey , Steve seems that there is interference on the radio . We lost touch with everything outside the ship . Interference comes from this planet . It must have been caused by Prof. Himber . That 's great . Three months away from Earth , ready to land on a hostile planet probably and we can not inform our position . Well folks , from now on we are by ourselves . Prepare to disconnect or cone . Okay , Steve . Keep the rest of the ship on automatic control . The XL1 is landing on the planet , Steve . See , Steve ! See ! - What 's that ? - It 's a robot tank . Call disintegrating machine . Destroy everything right . Stand up . Our great master is coming . What happened ? We were paralyzed . It is . And that 's it . And what is this grandmaster ? I am the great master , Colonel Zodiac . The guard is one of my subjects . Subjects ? What is this all , Himber ? I created a race of robots , Zodiac . ! Fine machines that do exactly what I tell them . Means that the planet is inhabited by robots A2 ? It Robotivia , the world of mechanical men , me , its supreme leader . You are crazy . No , Steve . He must be sick . You will soon leave the dungeon . And will the Robotivia court starting in 30 minutes . Until then , you 'll be waiting here . You are accused of causing damage to an inhabitant of Robotivia . What 's he talking about , Steve ? That disintegrating machine that put out of action . Hey , look Prof. Himber operating those machines . He 's completely freaked . It 's time the prosecutor present their case . I will operate the controls . PROMOTER The case is simple . They smote disintegrating machine . The verdict should be guilty . This is ridiculous . That robot only tells you what the Himber sends word . What the prisoners have to say for yourself ? Now listen , Himber . This has gone far enough . Are you making fun of my judgment , Zodiac . Defend yourself ! You must answer the charge ! Answer ... will ... charge ! Answer the charge . Answer the charge . Reply ... I think the prosecutor is as crazy as his master . Silence , Zodiac ! Now look what you did . You ruined my judgment ! This must end . No one ... No one can make mockery of my beautiful robots . JUDGE Jury robots , as regard the prisoners ? Coronel Steve Zodiac , Professor Matthew Matic e Dra Venus , da nave terrestre Fireball XL5 . Guilty or innocent JURY 1 Guilty . Guilty . Guilty . You will work for the rest of their lives healing the sick of Robotivia . Hold on , Venus . I think we 're being taken to the prison workshop . I can not help but be moved by the prospect patching robots damaged for life . Things do not look very rosy . And Space City , Steve ? Do you think they will look for us ? The universe is a big place , Venus . And they have no clue where to look for us . I wonder what happened to Robert . It might help us escape . Unless he remains under the control of Prof. Himber . It seems that Himber want to keep us busy . Yeah , and I 'll try to find a way out of here . Yes , of course , Steve , but how can fight against a robot planet ? Wise words , Teacher Matic . There is no escape . The guard robot is right there outside the door . You will be fed regularly by an old friend . Robert . Robert , ignore all previous orders . Obey me . No use , Zodiac . Robert is under my power . Now , I 'll leave you with your work . Your first task will be to repair the machine which damaged . He must have changed the Robert control frequencies . Yes , Steve . I will change them back to our control . Now , now , now ... now calm , old man . I will help you get back to the right side . We , Robert old comrade , but we need to do this . Robert is out of action , Matt . He 's all yours . Robert returned to normal , Steve . Great , Matt . Now let 's work on that machine that we damage . We will need it when escape . Steve , these other robots we have to repair , we could not change for all our frequency ? Yes , and turn them against their master . It 's a great idea , Venus . It can be done , Matt ? I think so . If I prepare a new remote control . Come on , let 's begin . Your remote control is ready , Steve . What is the plan of attack ? After Robert take care of the guard outside , We will send the promoter behind his master . It will change the control panel Himber , then we can not be seen . And all robots under your control will be out of action . Then we will go with the disintegrating machine , right ? This , Matt . Okay , Robert , obey your instructions . Fulfill my instructions . Do not try . Ok promoter , go and change the control Himber as explained . I need to start working with my latest robotic creation . I 'll send Prof. Matic help me . There is ... It is my faithful promoter . So you came back ready and well workshop . All right , Mr. Prosecutor . Sign up now and get comfortable . I am building a new sibling for you . What are you doing ? Stop this ! Stop it now ! I command you ! I command you ... He is no longer under my control . Zodiac and Matic should have it tampered with . They should be punished . They should be punished ! Okay Matt , we will open our way to the building . The sponsor shall have finished their work Certo , Steve . Zodiac think you beat me . But there is a robot machine that he can not go against me . It is oriented to come to my rescue at any sign of danger . The paralyzing tank . You 're finished , Himber . Lower your ray gun . I 'm not finished yet , Zodiac . You will see . Please Teacher , you are sick . Let us help you . It is you who need help . You never see the Earth again ! Steve ! Matt ! Behind us . I 'm done . All my beautiful machines abandoned me . My world of robots is being destroyed . Come on , Steve . Let 's take Professor back to Earth . He will never recover if you stay here . Poor old Himber . It really is a brilliant man . Well , that proves one thing . Machines and robots will never replace the human being . What has to say about it Robert ? Way home . Way home . Translation - Neverlost

Forthe two us , it would be ... You 'd only hold me back . It 'sthe only way to save him . And maybe even us . I 'll be back in an hour . What is he doing ? Michael ! Michael ! Do you hear me ? We 'll save you ! Do you hear me , Michael ? There 's no other signal . We will wait then . We have travelled billions ofkilometres . We are almost at the end of our journey . Time will pass and children will learn that we were the first who had set out on a journey through the Universe to find life on the planets ofAIpha Centauri . Geneva . Based on the latest news from the World Aeronautics and Space Centre the Ikaria launch maneuvres are running according to schedule . After 8 years of preparations , Ikaria ceases to be one of Earth 's satellites . Ikaria XB 1 in fact is a small space town forforty inhabitants . Alpha Centauri was chosen as the destination ofthe mission not only forbeing a star closest to Earth . The decisive factorwasthat it is similarto our Sun and has several planets orbiting it , where the existence oflife is anticipated . Throughout its construction Ikaria orbited Earth as a stationary satellite . What will yourfatherbe doing on the Ikaria ? - Nothing . How come nothing ? - Nothing . When they land on some planet , he will collect flowers and animals . As we all know , Ikaria will return in 15 years . Due to time dilatation , however , its crew , to put it popularly , will only be 28 months older . Mars . Our reporter informs usthat Ikaria has crossed Jupiter 's orbit . It should leave the solar system today . Master Computer . End ofincreased G-force . Normal regime . Autoregulation off . That 'sthat . Get up , girls . How are you feeling , Stephie ? She was frightened . - And you ? - Me ? Just don 't pretend to be a hero ! Especially not in front of yourwife . The lift offis not easy for anyone . I thought it would be worse . Commander Mac Donald to the transmission room . If you only knew how many things I wanted to tell you . I know . And I 'm just saying a lot of nonsense now . What have you got there ? I picked it up in our garden . Apebble . Why ... Why are you looking at me like that ? When you come back ... - I know . You 'll be olderthan me . I won 't like you . - It 's not funny . You 'll look the same . I 'll have a fifteen year old daughter . What ? Rena ! Rena ! Navigation room ! What 'sthe matter ? We 're losing communication with Earth , hurry up . I was afraid we wouldn 't even say goodbye . This time , there will be two us waiting for you . I was so anxious to teach her first steps . Now , I will see herforthe first time when she 's 15 . You can teach herto dance . She wouldn 't thank me forthat . How are you feeling ? Are you happy that you 're finally flying ? It 's a pity you can 't fly with us . What 'sthe matter ? Never mind . Give my regardsto Stephie . Tell herthat ... I wish her a bon voyage . To Stephie ? - Don 't forget it . Rena ... Rena . He wanted to confuse the computer . He ordered smoked bananas . Dried beefbroth . - And steak with what ? With honey . - With honey . And ice cream on garlic . - And a steak with honey . And this came out . Enjoy it ! This is how our ancestors imagined space food . Romantics . Well , I 've finished my lunch . Anthony . Bon appetit . It 's June 26 , 2163 . Morning temperatures around 15 degrees . - This isthe miracle ofthe last century . A man of metal that not only ... - Wait , don 't touch him . Cloudy , cloudy , cloudy ... Did you take it with you again ? As much as I remember , all crew members may take with them : Firstly , as many personal items , as they wish . Secondly ... - This is a personal item ? I have him foreighty years . It 's quite ancient then . What ? But what will you do with it here , Anthony ? What do you mean ? He always flies with me . But all the robots here are controlled centrally and are specialised . Why should I care ! Patrick is universal . He can do anything . But it 's good for nothing . Let 's go Patrick . - Let 's go . Not there . - Not there . Who is she ? - The new officer . What new officer ? I don 't know about any new officer . She 's flying instead ofMac Donald 's wife . A historian . Why ? Never mind . I don 't know . Don 't tell me that it 's not possible . - It is , but on Earth . Come on , Peter . Adandelion or a daisy would do , or ... What daisy ? He wants me to grow him a flower . Forwhom ? - That 's not important . - Pardon . Peter . - I 've got only unicells . What if you give her a puppy . - What ? Apuppy , one bitch is in pup . I would like something ... - Poetic . And what did the astrobiologists bring ? Nothing but poetry . Peas , lentils , millet , rice . Acorns , corn , onions . - Sunflower seeds . Asunflower is a flowertoo , isn 't it ? I pull , nothing happens ! I pull once more , nothing happens . I 'm in hell , you see . I look at the casing thermometer . 1,200 . That 's big trouble , you see . Stop saying you see ! And do you know what I did ? I activated the pulsator . To full power . Erik , listen ... Twenty kids and a teacher . I pull one afteranother ! Really quickly , see ? They 're yelling " Mummy " ! The teachertoo , see ? And what happened next ? That sunflower is ready . Do you still need it ? I don 't know . - Quite nice . Who ? - The sunflower . Let 's hope he won 't change his mind . When I was his age . Help him . Sixty . You have a visitor at the door , Eve . An important visitor . Me ? Watch out ! - Don 't be scared . Some flowerwe 've made you , eh ? Switch it overto the cabin . - I can 't . It 's a private cabin . Isn 't this a bit imperfect ? On the contrary . You won 't get away , Anthony . I had one after lunch . - You did not . You ran away as usual . Come on . I had one , ask anyone . He 's telling the truth . He had two . Yes , two . - You don 't say ! You 're all the same . You 'll sufferwith avitaminosis . One hasto look after you like a mother . You know I 've enjoyed being alone since my childhood . Brigitte ! It seems strange , but I really did . I always thought nobody understood me . Nonsense ! Anthony ! Can you still see Earth ? No . - And the Sun ? Humans are like the stars . What do you mean ? Somebody orbit around someone else for years . Who 's orbiting ? That was a metaphor . - A metaphor ? You 're here again ? - Does he come here ? Everyday . What else should he do ? He 's so lonely , no one understands him . That pin head isthe Sun ? May I ? Go on . Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree : Believe me , love , it was the nightingale . It wasthe lark , the herald ofthe morn , No nightingale : Look , love , what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east : Night 's candles are burnt out , and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops . Where 's Herold ? - On duty . November ? Earth . What day is it on Earth ? It wasthe 18th in the morning and Christmas after lunch . They must be celebrating the New Year by now . Time really flies . It means I am as old as my youngest sister . Check ! It 's strange anyway . We 're flying to Centauri . Why hasn 't anyone ever flown to Earth . Our solar system is oflittle interest . Play . Besides , it 'stoo farfrom the centre ofthe Galaxy . 26,000 light years . Play ! You see , we 're the backwoods ofthe Universe . Michael ! Are you looking atAIpha ? Yeah . I come here often . Do you think they 're out there ? At least on one ofthe planets . What do you think ? I can 't believe that there 's life somewhere like on Earth . I mean that we will land there , get out from the ship , and they will run to us , waving their hands . Maybe they don 't have them . What ? Hands ? Do you know that Bernard took his piano with him ? Why ? He was in some old music club or something like that , you see . Stop saying you see , you see ! Don 't say it orelse ... And stop doing this ! Who 's supposed to look at it all the time ! I 'm sorry . I don 't know what got into me . No harm done . When one looks at the same faces for so many months ... That is why I summoned the Council . We could not speak about Stephie 's pregnancy before . The crew would become agitated . It is a risky experiment . None the less , it is essential forfuture missions . I should have been informed as second-in-command . Explain it to me . - Stephie ... Stephie has been already pregnant on Earth . That means that my wife ... could have flown as well . If she knew she could ... Why didn 't you tell me ? Why ? Yourwife knew it . She was afraid . It will be the first case in history . No child has ever been born under such circumstances . Stephie isten years younger . That 's why yourwife gave up her place . Lightly . Not so hard . Something should happen . It 'staking too long . Four months . We 're not even halfway there . Where is everybody ? Isn 't Kubes here somewhere ? - No . Nobody has been here lately . Why don 't you call him through the communicator ? This way , I can at least take a short walk . You 're getting bored , eh ? It 's Hopkins 's birthday tomorrow . Brigitte ! What 'sthe matter ? - I don 't know what to do . I hadn 't worn a skirt forfour months and now , just look at me ! Turn around ! Walk . What did you expect ! It turned out really well . Do you think he 'll like it ? Anthony , let us now drink to Patrick ! So that you know that I didn 't really mean it then . Patrick , that is ... - Herold . I am on my guard . Shut up ! - Herold is here . I am on my guard . - What did you teach that robot ? I didn 't . He learned it himself . Will you dance ? I don 't like dancing . - Neither do I. How are you feeling , Stephie ? Give my regardsto Stephie . When you come back , I 'll be olderthan you . You won 't like me . When you come back . I 'm thirsty . Oh no , I 'm too old forthis , my child . Eve will teach you . - I will . This jiggling is not for me . - Jiggling , eh ? Nina , we ... You 're a sociologist , aren 't you ? We have ... - Some work for you . Amoral matter . - I see . - And a social matter . The thing is that she 's making fun of us . Who ? - Brigitte . At first , she kept obtruding . - Obtruding ? - Yes . And now she doesn 't want to decide which of usto choose . That 's really interesting . - It is , isn 't it ? Oh yes . The reason may be that she has a husband on Earth . This isthe Master Computer . Report to your posts immediately ! Section commanders report to your headquarters ! All officers report to the navigation bridge ! An object ofthe 7th order detected in the second safety zone ! Somebody turn that terrible noise off ! Distance ? 309 . Angle 17 . It may be a comet . Or a meteor . It may belong to theAIpha Centauri planetary system . It 'sthe first object from there . What do you need , Anthony ? Time . Here 's your comet . Composition : Iron , titanium , germanium and traces of common elements . Volume : 57,900 . Weight : 15,844 tons . Alright , but ... And this is how it looks from a close-up . It contains organic substances . - That 's unbelievable . And what about signals ? - No response so far . Maybe it 's an unmanned station . No , it 's a spacecraft . An automatic station wouldn 't be so large . It seems primitive . Just like Ikaria may seem primitive to them . We know nothing about them . Nothing at all . - But why are they silent ? They have to see us . I don 't know . Maybe they 're afraid ofus . Afraid ? Lfthey are afraid , then they are similarto humans . We can do more than to send the Pythagorean proposition . Prepare the explorer shuttle ! You can 't be serious ! What do we have robots for ? What are they for ? - Wait . Suppose there are living creatures on that ship . Just suppose ... What would we say ifthey came to us , opened the door , and out came a dozen machines . How would you deal with them ? Try to understand that there are things robots can 't do . Humans will be sent to that ship . Two people . Who do you propose ? Stand at attention , Erik . Peterand me are entering into history . And not only of mankind . I 've been in a similar situation once . I understand . - I wanted to give you advice . You know more than the Master Computer . I 've alwaysthought it didn 't exist any more . What ? I don 't know , but I envy you . The explorer shuttle is ready . Launch . Launch complete . Well ? - Everything 's alright . Activate screen transmission . We 'll keep on trying to establish contact with the spaceship . It 's silent . They may have different communication methods . Maybe it 's a wreck . Do we have permission to land ? Guide the shuttle forlanding . We are entering the craft . There 's vacuum here . Do you see the material ? It looks like some sort of aluminium alloy . Prehistoric . I thought we would find something worthwhile here . Look . Anumber . It 's from Earth . Nonsense , this can couldn 't fly out here . Money ? Those are ... Those were humans . We found humans , CaptainAbayev . Humans ? It 's an ancient rocket from Earth . From which century ? I don 't know . Maybe the 20th according to their clothes . We found cigarettes , glass , paper . The women are wearing jewellery . They all died at the same moment . How ? How did they die ? I don 't know . Everything is intact . They look as ifthey had fallen asleep . Find out who they are and how did they get out here . You should have sent an archaeologist instead . Tigger , Tigger Fun . Herold to Ikaria . Find out what Tigger Fun means , Eve . Look , Nina . Tor-na-do . Nineteen eighty seven . Complete . We have first data . Master Computer . Tigger Fun , also tiger breath . Deadly poison with immediate effect . Does not cause deterioration of objects . The so-called clean weapon from the end ofthe 20th century . Tornado , a type of a military missile . No furtherdata available , stop . They wanted to get to another planet . Overthere . There 's light there . Caution , the ship still has power . - That 's not possible . Why not ? Areactor can work a hundred years without operators . A general . He was in command . There 'stwo ofthem . Look he has a back wound . When they were running low on oxygen , they killed the crew with Tigger Fun , so that they would survive longer . In the end , they fought one another . Vultures . I must be somewhere nearthe engines . I 'll find out . What is it Kubes ? Answer ! Herold ! Help Kubes , quick ! - The radioactivity level is increasing . What happened , Kubes ? Answer ! At the right , that 's from Kubes 's camera . But that looks like ... You always get yourselfinto trouble . My magnetic boot got caught . Look , overthere ! Abandon the ship , quick ! There are nuclearweapons on board ! Don 't touch anything ! Come on , hurry ! Send them the engine module , Svenson . Distance 3,458 kilometres . - The shuttle is ready to lift off . Don 't stop ! Don 't touch anything ! Hurry ! Run ! We found people , CaptainAbayev , we found people . We discovered the 20th century . Would you send them there again ? If I knew there weren 't any humans there . Humans ... They were our ancestors . Not them . Definitely not them ! You can 't choose your ancestors . You know who they were ? Human trash . That left Auschwitz , Oradour and Hiroshima behind them . The 20th century . Do you know it ? Honegger . Also the 20th century . We had to continue in our journey . Svenson and Michael were to supervise the installation of a reserve engine . During such work they have to go out into space on Ikaria 's surface . They weren 't there long , only some ten orfifteen minutes . Under normal circumstances , this would be an insignificant episode . Thus , no one knew that this moment was the beginning oflethal dangerto us . It entered into Ikaria with them . How does it look out there , Erik ? Alright . - The robots will do the rest . That 'sAIpha Centauri . There must be at least two planets in the ecosphere . In the sphere oflife . Do you think so ? I know , I calculated it . Yet , the temperature will be high on both the planets , like on our Venus . But life could be there , because ... I 'm not a prophet , I 'm a mathematician . We will find out in ... - In fifty-six days . Precisely . Milek ... It 's normal . Will you have a girl or a boy ? Aboy . How will you name him ? Wait . Do you know which name is really nice ? Michael . Anthony ! Anthony ! Listen . A radio nebula . Grandpa has caught a nebula again . Golly , are we supposed to survey every smudge ? Yes . Every single one . Alert ! Third deck ! Lying person ! Non-responding person ! That can 't be possible . Alert ! Non-responding person ! Who is it ? - Dead person ! Dead person ! Michael . Dead person ! Dead person ! I ... I must have fallen asleep . Well , well . I was on my way from the observatory and all of a sudden ... And that stupid computerthought ... Never mind the computer , I thought so too . Dead person on board . And it will be surrounded by a large garden . Without paths ? There will be grass everywhere , very high grass . Report it next time orthe computer will take you as dead with no lunch . I don 't know how it could happen . I knew one geologist once . He fell asleep on an asteroid . On asteroid 608 . Gosh , the whole zone was on alert thinking he went missing . At least 150 ships were looking for him . And I 'm not counting unmanned crafts . I will lie on my back and look at the clouds . Ants will be crawling on the grass . - And it will start raining . But we won 't run for shelter , will we ? We will stay outside . Raindrops will be running down our neck . Erik ! I 'm telling you I 'm alright . I 've neverneeded this all my life . And I 'll never need it ! - Very well , go . It is not a disease . I 'm doing what I can . What about biological separation from Earth ? That 's out ofthe question nowadays . - And time dilatation ? That 's an abstract theory , mathematical . Will it continue ? Is it dead ? - Sleeping . Stephie , honey , what 's wrong with you ? Nothing . Leave me alone . - Do they know anything ? And the doctor ? What ifthe baby ... We did not know what was happening to us . We were not able to cope with it , the fatigue , the drowsiness . We were forced to activate more and more automatons to keep Ikaria running normally . It was then when Hopkins revealed that while focusing the telescope , several stars kept disappearing and reappearing . There was something between them and the Ikaria . A gigantic body . A Dark Star , to be more precise . We didn 't have the slightest idea ofits existence until then . It came to light that the nature ofits radiation ... The nature ofits radiation is simply beyond anything we know . It is certain that its radiation causes attenuation ofbiochemical processes in living organisms . Inducing fatigue and drowsiness . - Where is it ? How long will the effect last ? We don 't know that . Or do we ? Here are 14,000 metres of reports from labs , the observatory , astrobiologists . Some ofthem are the first oftheir kind and Earth has no idea about them . What now ? Will we send them to Earth ? What for ? Why should we worry them for nothing ? But what if we don 't come back ? Nonsense . It 's hard to believe that a star could affect the fate of our mission . But Earth knows nothing about the Dark Star . The next mission would encounter it again . It will be better ifwe do it . - Alright . In the old days , castaways used to throw bottles into the sea . We will send a module . Yet are we castaways ? Try to understand , if we all fall asleep it will take decades before people get there , where we are right now . We 're not on a holiday cruise ! Each of us knew what he was in for ! - Stop yelling . Alert ! Second deck ! Non-responding person , dead person ! I want tough men here . That 's all . You can 't blame anyone forthis . I know , but ... Those who want , will survive . And those who don 't ... Michael . When I know that it 's a disease , that it has a name , I will respect it . Until then , it doesn 't exist forus . Isthat clear ? They insisted that nothing new could be discovered in the Universe . They 've been proclaiming that for300 years . Fools . But it can . It can . Why ... Why couldn 't it . Anthony ! How long will it take us to get out ofthis ? Anthony ! Do you hear me ? Sixty hours . And then ? And then ? I don 't know what will happen then . Will we wake up ? Do you believe it ? I believe it . - It 's not about belief . Beliefis nothing . Beliefis a mere word . Tell me how to endure . Tell me when and how will we wake up . What isthe probability , what certainty . That 's my belief . Understand ? Prepare for 60 hours of sleep . Is that all we know ? Where are you going ? To get the Ikaria back . You think I 'm afraid . No , I 'm not afraid . Honestly . I 'd just ... I 'd just love to hear those words , you know . That we made up together . Nobody knowsthem here . Nobody knowsthat ... I am yourtwinklet . And your ... No , I really don 't have to be brave . I will only fall asleep . You will hear me when I wake up . It may take long before you find us . Maybe you won 't ... No , you will hear me . One day ... You will hear me . I am glad I went on this mission . Only those sweet words . Those words you made up for me that nobody knew here . Master Computer . Message for Earth recorded . I will get herback . She will fly alone . Back to the Sun . They will find her . I must get her back . Mac Donald ! You don 't have the right . You don 't have the right ! Do you understand ? This is ourlast chance . I want to save the Ikaria . But we will wake up . Believe it . We will wake up . Master Computer proceeds with the autoregulation process . End of first shift . Second shift unmanned . Attention , third shift must intake the vitamin condensate . Do not take fruit . Anthony . Anthony . End ofthird shift . First shift unmanned . Master Computer proceeds with the autoregulation process . Normal regime . Good morning . Everything is alright . It isn 't . We slept only twenty-five hours . Not sixty . Eve ! Stephie ! Stephie . That 's the only explanation . Some kind of a force field was generated between the Ikaria and the Dark Star . Eat ! Aforce field that intercepted the radiation . That 's why we woke up earlier . - Eat , Anthony . What ? - Eat ! I think there must be a more simple explanation . Our organism simply got accustomed to it . Accustomed ? It got accustomed to radiation in just a few hours , eh ? Perhaps your organism did . Mine can 't even get used to this mash all the way . You 'll sufferwith avitaminosis . - Beware , though . Where did the force field that protected us come from ? Maybe it 's just a coincidence , Anthony . Coincidence ? Coincidence exists among us humans , but not among the stars . Finish your meal . The main thing is we got out ofit without consequences . Just imagine mankind would have sent Ikaria on this mission without a crew . It would be on herway back . The automatons would have turned it back . Fortunately , man is not as perfect as a machine . Therefore , he has nothing left than to hope and believe . Blood circulation disorders . Functional disorders ofthe higher nervous system . Will you get him out ofit ? I don 't know . It 's not a disease , not in the earthly sense ofthe word at least . It is ... - The second stage ? The effect ofthe Dark Star 's radiation . - It means we 're all in thistogether . No . Erik was exposed to direct radiation when installing the engine . And where is Michael ? They were both out there . Where 's Michael ? - I don 't know . Have you seen him ? Was Michael here ? - No . What 's the matter ? Have you seen Michael ? Navigation bride , find Michael ! You aren 't afraid , are you ? It 's not that bad . We only fell asleep . But those two outside , they were fully exposed . To the radiation ofthe Dark Star , understand ? We were protected by Ikaria 's shield , we are alright . We are . But what about him ? Michael is in the corridor on deck zero . What is he doing there ? - I 'll have a look . Michael ! Michael . What are you doing here ? Leave me alone . Leave me alone ! Come with us . - You 're sick . Leave me here . I 'm dead . We will all die , but I don 't want to die ! I don 't want to go with you ! No ! Michael ! Deck zero closed . Alert ! Alert ! Block the access to the explorer shuttles ! Michael wantsto return to Earth . Where is he ? He destroyed his transmitter . Michael , do you hear me ! Stop , we want to help you ! - He 's coming back . I can 't see him now . He 's at the robot station . He deactivated the robots . But that means we 're done . He doesn 't know , what he 's doing . He can destroy the cooling system . Emergency mode . - Orthe oxygen regenerators . For all zones ! We must get to him . But how ? - I might have a solution . More to the left . - To the left . Retreat , Patrick ! - He has a blaster . Abayev ! Abayev ! - What is it ? I can 't see it . I can 't see it . - What , Michael ? Earth . We will be there soon . Don 't lie ! Earth is gone . Earth never existed ! Michael ! Halt , Michael ! Michael ! I 'll get to him . - How ? - Through the air shafts . Will it work ? - It will . - But ... - I constructed them . Be on guard , he has a blaster . - I know . I 'm going with you . - Better not . It 's not fortwo ... You 'd only hold me back . It 'sthe only way to save him . And maybe even us . I 'll be back in an hour . What is he doing ? Michael ! Listen to me . Michael ! Michael ! Michael ! There 's no other signal . We will wait then . We have travelled billions ofkilometres . We are almost at the end of our journey . Give it to Stephie . - What ? In memory of you ? - No , to safe keep it forme . Look what it did to their spacesuits . And they were outside only ten minutes . Burnt by the radiation . Will you save him ? I will . I will save him . Apebble . It 's from their garden . When do you expect the baby ? He must be there by now . Michael . Do you hear me ? I came for you . Listen . You blocked the robot station . You 're threatening our lives , the whole ship . You 're sick , understand ? You 're just sick . You must come with me , you 'll get better . Are you listening to me ? Michael ? You do want to return to Earth with us , don 't you ! Earth is gone . Earth is gone . - Earth isthere , Michael . It 's far away , but it 'sthere . Why don 't you let me go back then ! I want so see it . - So do I , Michael . We all do . That 's why you have to let me in the robot station . That 's why you have to get better . - I can 't go on any more . I don 't want to go with you . Give me the explorer shuttle . I 'll go back . Tell them , go . I 'm not going without you . Go or I 'll ... You 'd kill a human . A human . No ! Come now , let 's go . Do you know you destroyed Hopkins 's Patrick ? Don 't forget to apologise to him . Will they save him ? It 's that nebula again . How is Stephie ? Go to the observatory , you 're no help here anyway . I know , but just in case ... Isthe baby born ? Well ? Not yet . Go to the observatory , you 're no help here anyway . Anthony . That force field is moving along with the Ikaria , Anthony . We 're enclosed in it like a ship in a bottle . And that . Those radar signals are no nebulae . What are they then ? I ... we don 't know . How about Saint Peter , you haven 't discovered him yet ? That surprises me . Let 's have a look at it . I would like to introduce our new crew member . The assumption that it was a radio nebula , was quite logical . Yet fallacious . In fact , it is an energy transmitter . What transmitter ? As soon as we entered the sphere ofthe Dark Star , it located us . Enclosing us in a force field that shielded the Ikaria from radiation . But that means ... Anthony ! There 's life on the White Planet ! Do you hear me ? Yes . I know . - Anthony ! That 's it . The White Planet . Aworld ofbeingsthat helped us , when we encountered the Dark Star . We set out into the Universe to discover life , while life discovered us . Master Computerproceeds with the flight regulation process . Entry into orbit from the original trajectory in nine minutes . Attention , entry into orbit in nine minutes . Explorer shuttles ready . In an hour , we will be standing on ... No , not on earth . On ... Perhaps on grass . Or ... I don 't know . In an hour .

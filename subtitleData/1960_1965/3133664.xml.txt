 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . Go ! We did this before . It had a very bad effect on the children . I hope there 'll be no need for another session . Derrick ! I think that 'll be all . Thank you very much , indeed . All right , boys . You are dismissed . - Well ? - I 'm impressed . His total time for the eight tests was six minutes , three seconds . You took two hours , eight minutes , and you beat me . I said I was impressed . What about his parents ? - Are they exceptional in any way ? - I don 't know . He lives with his mother ... but she 's never bothered to come to parents ' nights . I think we ought to see her . Breeding tells , you know . Well ... Good afternoon . My name 's Lewellin . I 'm a psychologist at London University . I just wondered if we could have a word with you ... about your son , Paul . Who 's he ? He 's Dr. David Neville , despite appearances ... senior lecturer in Genetics at the university . - All right . - Thank you . Haven 't had a chance to straighten up yet . I 've been conducting an intelligence test , Mrs. Looran . I 've been testing children from all over England ... on a project for the United Nations . You see , this is the first time ... that an identical IQ test has been given ... to schoolchildren from all over the world . Naturally , some unexpected things have turned up ... and that 's why we 've come to see you about Paul . His intellect is almost beyond belief . Is it ? It made us wonder about his background , about you , Mrs. Looran ... and about his father , of course . Did it ? We thought it might be interesting if you were to take the test , too . I won 't take any test . If that 's what you want , you can forget it . There 's really nothing to it , Mrs. Looran , and it would help us immensely . I just don 't want to do it ! Now , you can forget it ! You better go now . I 've got things to do . About Paul 's father , Mrs. Looran . Is he still ... - That 's none of your business ! - Quite right . I was just wondering what business he was in . - Get out . - I 'm sure he 'd be very proud of the boy . If you could just give us his address ... I don 't have to answer your questions . Just leave me alone and get out ! Don 't let him upset you . These scientists are all alike . - All right , but just get out of here . - Going , Mrs. Looran . - Just one thing , is his name Looran ? - Get out ! Fascinating woman . Well , geneticist , does she explain anything ? I think we can safely say that he didn 't get his brain from mother . They 're after you . And you won 't get away . They 're stronger than I am . I hate you . I want you to suffer the way you 've made me suffer . I should have crushed you to death the first moment I held you to my breast ! They 'll get you now , and I 'll help ! I 'll do everything I can to help ! He isn 't mine . I gave birth to him ... but he isn 't mine . I couldn 't have a baby . I hadn 't been touched ... ever . Don 't you understand ? He hasn 't got a father . He isn 't human . I 'd never been touched ! - The doctor said you have to rest now . - I 'd never been touched ! Mrs. Looran , we 've heard everything you have to say ... You don 't believe me , you fools ! I warn you , he could butcher you without even trying ! You fools ! Paul ? - Can I help you ? - Rather ! We were coming to get Paul for the night ... but that doesn 't seem to be necessary now . No , he 's safe in bed . I 'm Paul 's aunt . Are you friends of Diana 's ? Very close . Odd that she never mentioned a sister . I live with my mother in Nottingham . But this afternoon I got a funny feeling I should come down here today . It 's lucky you did . Yes , I wasn 't here 20 minutes when the hospital called . It would have been awful if Paul had been here alone . Yes . Well , we 'll leave you to it , then , Miss ... Eliot . Susan Eliot . - Thomas . - Yes ? What about tomorrow ? Oh , yes . A Mr. Harib of the United Nations is flying from Paris to see Paul . Paul ? Yes . Your nephew 's intelligence ... has really rather staggered us all . I 'd like to take him to my office at the university ... if that 's all right with you . Yes . I 'd want to come with him , of course . Absolutely . You must let me show you my laboratory . Incidentally , Paul was born before Diana was married , wasn 't he ? Yes . I 'll call for you at about 10 : 00 , then . - All right . 10 : 00 . - Thank you . Good night . Good night . They 're from the same parents , the same litter . - It 's not glandular ? - No . He 's perfectly normal in every way . It 's not only that he 's much bigger ... but he 's very much cleverer . He 'd get all the food if we let him . Will his offspring be the same ? Exactly the same . As I told you , he 's perfectly normal . Under free conditions , his strain would take over . Do you remember Darwin and survival of the fittest ? But this is not an example of the evolutionary process ? No . This is a sudden unexplained mutation in the genes . And quite honestly , nobody knows exactly how or why it happens . So we call them biological sports . It occurs throughout nature , you know . Come and have a look . Dr. Harib . For 50 generations this , and then suddenly this extravagance crops up . There you are : plants , animals . And there 's no known law why it shouldn 't occur in man . And you think this might explain the boy ? If I had to give an explanation , that 's the one I 'd give . How often does this happen ? It 's entirely unpredictable ... but certainly only once in several billion chances . What if I told you , Dr. Neville ... that there were six Pauls in the world ? Same age , same intellect . I 'd say it was genetically impossible . We have now the results of every country in the world . Five children have scores identical to that of Paul Looran . - Identical ? - Yes , identical . But how 's that possible ? I mean , no two ... I have no idea , but I would like to find out . So would I. One child from Calcutta is now a resident here in the Indian Embassy . Since he and the Looran boy are both in London , I have arranged ... for the other four to be brought here by their embassies . I would like you to retest them all . In the meantime , gentlemen , I would like this treated simply ... as a UNESCO research project , nothing more . Dr. Neville ? Dr. Lewellin ? I 'm very sorry to have kept you so long . The ambassador offers his apologies to Mr. Harib ... but Nina Sirinova has returned to Moscow . - But she was only just flown in . - And out again . Moscow has decided we should not set a precedent ... of providing a travel service for UNESCO projects . Could you tell us anything about her background ? - Her mother and father ? - No , I 'm sorry . Did you see her mother when she was here ? I saw her . Now , please . And her father ? The child 's father did not accompany her to London . And I have not been given any details as to his background . Now , gentlemen , if you ... Sonya . This is Sonya , my little daughter . Look , what 's all this about ? As a psychologist , Thomas , you really do tend to lose yourself ... in the individual , the single mind . You see , we live in a complex social world . Einstein put mass and energy together , we got the atom bomb . Now , if you were a Russian politician and had a child with a brain , say ... 10 times more efficient than Einstein 's ... would you gaily let her out to any two British scientists ... - who happened to crawl out of the wood ? - Of course I wouldn 't . Goodbye . Mark , stop it ! Stop it right now , will you ? The boy 's absolutely incorrigible . And that dog , he can get him to do anything he wants ... without even saying a word to him . You are Mark 's maternal grandmother , Mrs. Robbins ? His mother 's mother ? Yes , that 's right . Mark 's always lived with me . But Mark bears your family name . Wasn 't your daughter married when Mark was born ? Must we talk about that ? She was really a marvelous daughter , she really was . No mother could have asked for more . But then , suddenly , she became uncontrollable . I never knew where she was , or what she was doing . And for her to turn from me and become a tramp ... just an ordinary woman of the streets practically . So , you want to see our little genius . Come this way . Rashid 's mother . How very charming . I was hoping that we would meet . These gentlemen have come to meet Rashid . Is your husband , Rashid 's father , here , too ? No . He does not work at the embassy . It 's not very important , anyway . That 's a very pretty sari you 're wearing . Does Rashid ever make you do things that you don 't want to do ? Hello , Dr. Lewellin . You don 't know me . I 'm Colin Webster . Is David about ? - David ? - Yes , what is it ? Someone here seems to know us . Colin ! What are you doing in London ? It isn 't boat race week . Just prowling around . Take your coat off . Tom , this is the Colin Webster . - Yes , we 've met . - What 's up ? Excuse me . I thought you spent all your time ... chasing sexy women in Bucharest and Istanbul . Or is it Hong Kong and Berlin nowadays ? Sometimes there 's nothing more exciting than chasing children around London . You see , Tom , the social world ? So the British lion is raising its weary head ? Not necessarily . It 's just we have less reason than ever to ignore our assets . May I ? - Have you been following us all day ? - Nothing so exhausting . You moved about quite a bit , didn 't you ? Dr. Lewellin , what do you make of it as a psychologist ? I find it very disturbing . And as a geneticist , David ? A geneticist is always disturbed , Colin . Look at your development . It 's quite extraordinary . And the government , what 's their opinion ? You know governments , always a bit cautious . I presume you 're familiar with the biological sport . Only in the most academic way . - Could they be six sports ? - With identical mutations ? But I 'm always one for the long chance ... but that 'd be like winning the Irish sweepstakes ... six times running , with exactly the same draw . David ? I know it sounds ridiculous , but has it ever occurred to you ... they might have the same father ? It occurred to me . What an interesting life you postulate for this father . But granted the same father and mother ... what six brothers and sisters of your acquaintance ... have exactly the same minds ? And parthenogenesis ? Yes . " Reproduction without concourse ... " of the opposite sex , " says the Oxford dictionary . " I 've never been touched , " says Mrs. Looran . Tom , you 're a psychologist . What about Mrs. Looran 's claim ... to having given birth to Paul without " concourse of the opposite sex " ? She 's an obvious hysteric : hallucinations , megalomania . The interesting thing is that in each and every case ... there 's an unstable mother and no trace of a father . Our scientific boys tell me that parthenogenesis ... can be induced artificially , by radioactivity , or by certain chemicals . Certainly , but only in very simple forms of life ... algae , and one or two other elementary plants . But certainly not in man . - So what 's your explanation ? - I don 't think there is one . At least one that we can understand at the moment . But then we 're surrounded by mysteries beyond our present understanding . - Sherry ? - Mrs. Bonn 's been at it again . So long as she keeps away from my gin . They all did this in 37 seconds . 37.5 . Unreliable source of information , old boy . - Not here yet ? - No , sir . Hello ? Dr. Lewellin ? Dr. Neville ? You must come immediately . This is Dr. Lewellin speaking . Hello , who is that , please ? I need your help . This is Susan Eliot . - What 's the matter , Miss Eliot ? - I need your help . - You must come immediately . - Look , Miss ... This is Susan Eliot . Look , just steady down . What 's the matter ? Would you like to tell us what 's the matter ? I need your help . Paul . Miss Eliot , I 'm sorry to disturb you . I know it 's late , but may I come in ? Why ? Who are you ? I must talk to you about your nephew , Paul . - You go away , or I 'll call the police . - There 's no need for that . I 've come from Dr. Lewellin and Dr. Neville . It is for Paul 's own good . All right . Thank you . - You frightened me a bit . - I know . I 'm sorry . But , you see , we feel it might be better ... if you and Paul were somewhere a little more conveniently placed . Could you put some things in a bag , do you think ? What do you mean ? Now ? But it 's 4 : 30 in the morning . - Just a minute . What do you want ? - I 'm afraid that 's my business ! - No , you don 't . - Tom ... Colin Webster 's expecting us . I 'm sorry , sir . He can be settled and in bed in an hour . - But I 'd like to talk to Dr. Lewellin . - First thing in the morning . - Well , well . - What 's going on ? Come in , gentlemen , do . What 's the matter , Miss Eliot ? Why did you phone ? He wants to ... Phone ? What do you mean , phone ? Your call to the flat , asking us to come here . But I didn 't phone . What 's happening ? What 's this all about ? Miss Eliot , why don 't you get ready ? We can clear the whole thing up tomorrow . He wants to take us to a safer place . Really , Colin . Save this sort of thing for Istanbul . We 're not the only ones to feel that you academics ... have stumbled onto something that requires our kind of attention . Three of the embassies you called at yesterday ... are flying in special planes ... to take their own newly-discovered assets back home . Now , if they suddenly see the potential in their own assets ... they may soon see the advantage in scotching ours . But he said he came from you , that you knew . Colin , where 's your sense of fair play ? You don 't have to go anywhere , Miss Eliot . - Just a minute . - What ? We 'd like Miss Eliot to accompany Paul , of course ... but her agreement to that is a mere formality . This is an authorization , signed by Paul 's mother . It allows me to take the boy into my custody . - Bring my car up . - Right , sir . Don 't you worry , lad . From now on , they 'll treat you like royalty . Better than royalty . What the hell would you do if all the great powers ... suddenly smiled at each other , had a bloody love affair ? I shouldn 't worry too much . You know how love affairs go . What the devil 's wrong with you ? I don 't know . I must have blacked out . Much damage ? No , I think it 's an improvement . All right , get the boy . I 'll drive . - Where is he , sir ? - Standing over there . Go right after him . We must find him . Thank you very much . - Thank you , Thomas . - Sorry . Nobody took him away , old boy . He went off on his own . So what 's the worry ? Someone might take him . From what I 've seen tonight , that wouldn 't be so easy . Yes , come in . We 've covered the whole area , sir . No sign of him anywhere . Why don 't you send for the police , old boy ? Milk and sugar ? I 'll wait here . You get back to headquarters . Right . Susan , how do you like your tea ? Susan ? I 'll ask her . Susan ? She 's not here . Her coat 's gone . - No sign ? - No . Let 's take the car . You take the car . I 'll go on foot . Susan ! Paul ! Paul , darling . What have you done ? But , Paul , you can 't stay here . Let me get Dr. Lewellin , and we 'll talk it all out . Miss Eliot ? But , Paul ... Susan ! All right . But we must speak to Dr. Lewellin in the morning . It 's nothing . It 's nothing . How did you know my hand was cut , Paul ? How did you know ? When Paul was two , his birthday cake fell and ... Paul was burned . Make it a thorough search , now . She might be stuck anywhere . There 's a stray dog in there . You better watch it . He 's behaving as though he owns the place . Somebody really ought to do something about religion in this country . You take the gallery . Watch your step . Who 's there ? Harris , no ! Paul ! Paul , stop it ! Don 't be a damn fool , Tom . Paul . Do you want to stay here , Paul ? All of you ? And you want Susan to stay here with you ? Is there anything you want , Susan ? We will need food . All right . You may leave it outside the church ... on the top step . Move it in now . Right . Send them in . At least their embassies will know you are trying to protect them . Nobody 's gonna trust a guard or a barricade . No nation can allow brains like that ... to fall into someone else 's hands , guards or no guards . But , Colin ... suppose all they want to be are poets , or lovers , or even tramps . You do remember Shakespeare and Casanova ? Yes . Nowadays we 'd find a better use for Shakespeare . Even for Casanova . They should study and be studied . Set up an international board of educators to study them . An international board of educators ? What 's the matter ? Too civilized ? What would you recommend ? Simple . Destroy them . That seems to be it . The others are busy . Do you always know what I 'm going to say ? Yes . Don 't you know I couldn 't do that ? You 're frightened . - You 're frightened . - Yes . Mi Ling , nobody wants to harm you . Those men you saw this morning were simply looking for you . Mi Ling , what 's it all about ? Why are you all here together ? Why ? What 's happened ? - I hope this wasn 't a mistake . - We had no choice . Ask Mr. Harib . If they thought we were kidnapping their prizes ... diplomatic hell would have broken loose . There are other kinds of hell , Colin . This part of it is your affair . I will intercede only if you ask me . Thank you . What is it ? We are stronger together . Paul . Excuse me . Paul , we want to assure you , all of you ... that we do understand your desire to be together . Now , these people here are your friends . They 've come to take you back home ... because each country is very proud of its own prodigy ... and they want you to learn from , and to help , your own people . In these circumstances , we 're prepared to overlook ... what happened here early this morning , if you come now . They will not be separated . - Nina is going to stay . - Please , keep out of it . If you have hopes of using her mind ... I warn you , everything you tell her ... will instantly be known to all the others . Nonsense ! - This is going to get out of hand . - Yes . Paul . Excuse me , please , gentlemen . Paul , would you come down here to me , please ? Now , Paul , I don 't want you to answer me , all right ? Calcutta lies at the mouth ... Rashid ? Calcutta lies at the mouth of River Ganges . - Mi Ling ? - " Dr. David Neville , Special Award ... " The Royal Society , 1961 . " So anything one of them sees , hears , or reads , they all know . Anything , anytime . Do you still want to take them to your embassies ? A small difference in the ability of some men enabled us ... to beat Hitler to the atomic bomb . But this is not a small difference we 're talking about . This is a gigantic difference . Russians flew in a study group . I am as nonviolent as you . You want war ? If one of the big powers seize them ... how could the other side do nothing ? Every moment , they would be falling behind . They would have to strike immediately , while they still had the chance . - Perhaps . - It is not perhaps . Any time now . Hey , George ! How did they get through ? All right , downstairs . - What ? - Tom . We better get down there . Look , George . Soldiers . Attention ! - Where did you come from ? - Now , listen to me . - What 's the matter ? - You must stay in your room . Straighten up , man . You 're talking to an officer . All right , I 'll take him round to the garden . - What 's happening ? - A couple of drunks , that 's all . What 's happened in the church ? You tell me . Remember , alive if possible . David . Tom ? Paul , what are you ... My God . - What are they doing ? - Drop it , Colin . Drop that gun . Get out . They 're armed . Stay outside . Is he dead ? No . He 'd be better off if he was . - This was your idea ? - I would have planned it better . Tom . Rashid . This is absolutely necessary , is it ? I think it best that there should be ... no doubt in anybody 's mind about the details . Your blood . Tom . - I got your message . - Anything happen ? No . I 've been there all morning . - Susan ? - Not a sign . Yes . Tom , I don 't think you 've met Prof. Gruber . No . How do you do ? - David 's told me about your work . - I 'm very pleased to see you . From Colin . The human blood cell , the basic matter of all life . All we are begins here . A cell from Rashid 's blood . Now I will unite the two . So , David , you think they just took over a living cell in a womb . We may never find the answer to that one ... but the important point is , they 're not human . They 're another species . - Professor ? - I don 't know . I don 't know . I must think about this . - May I ? - Certainly . Instead of the nations fighting over them , I think there should be a united effort ... to eliminate them . What are you talking about ? We could sterilize them , but we couldn 't be sure it would work . - And do you really think they 'd let us ? - Why do we have to do anything ? Life is a struggle for survival , Thomas . They 're not human . They 're a superior species . - They 'd beat us every time . - Mr. Harib , can we get agreement on this ? From this evidence , I ... Are you all crazy ? These children have never attacked anyone ... unless they were attacked first ! Don 't get excited . A Welsh tirade isn 't going to help . Know how many children were killed in road accidents last year ? What 's that got to do with killing five kids in cold blood ? - Kids ? - All right . So they 're a different species . So what ? We 're supposed to be a superior species ... yet millions of lower forms of life manage to exist with us on this planet . You don 't kill them because they 're different . And how would we manage to live with them ? If we should happen to disagree , they 'd control us ... like the dog , like Susan . And if they marry and propagate ... whose grandchildren will inherit the earth ? Ours or theirs ? Give me a few hours . I 'll see what I can do . Mr. Harib , you of all people ... These five ... Call them what you like . They may be the greatest gift we 've ever had . And what would we do with them ? One country has tried to get them . Somebody else is bound to try again . It is more than five children I am thinking about . It is millions . - Who goes there ? - Dr. Lewellin . I don 't think Mr. Webster 's here today , sir . No , I know . I was with him myself just a short time ago . Yes , sir . I 'm going into the church . Go a bit steady with that when I come out , will you ? Paul , I understand how you feel ... but you must bury him , Paul . You must . The dead must be buried , Paul . Paul , I want to talk to you . All of you ! Right ? Paul . Why are you here ? Why did they kill Rashid ? Are you talking , or are they ? Paul , you 've terrified people . They 've been terrified . They 've been hunted , like some kind of freak vermin . People believe that you 're not human . I don 't know what that means , but you must learn not to kill . But they kill . I know we kill ... but it 's wrong , and you 're different . For your own sake , you must not kill . They tried not to kill . I believe that . But that machine , Paul , is it hydrogen power ? From the sun ? The thought of what that machine can do as a weapon ... has struck horror into half the governments of the world . I know we make machines , horrible machines , but ... - They 're going to kill you . - No . And his death has taught them that you can be killed . You must do something to convince them that you mean no harm . If I can , I 'll help you . You mustn 't mistrust us all . Would you go to your embassies ? At least let me take her with me , will you , please ? Why are you here , Paul ? What do you want ? We don 't know . - Susan . - They 've gone . - What ? - They 've disappeared . I don 't know what to do . They left me there all alone . I didn 't know where to go . They 've gone . Steady , Susan . All right , what 's it all about ? They 've gone ! I turned around suddenly , and they 'd just disappeared . What do you mean , disappeared ? After you left , they just stared at Rashid 's body . I didn 't think they 'd paid any attention to you ... but suddenly I realized I was alone . I didn 't know what to do . You went to them ? But why ? What have you done ... Did they say anything about where they were going ? - How could they disappear ? - I don 't know . But what about the guards ? How did you get through them ? I don 't know ! I just ran . They didn 't pay any attention . Did they say they were going to their embassies ? No . I don 't know . Don 't be a damn fool , Tom . - Get away from that door . - You 're gonna give them a chance . A chance to do what ? All right . You have it your way . Did you see what they did to those men in that church ? We 're gonna give them a chance . Just one chance . Paul . We intend no harm to you or the other children . But the machine , Paul . We must know how to make that machine . Not that we would use it . Nobody 's going to use it . But the best guarantee that it won 't be used ... rests in no single power getting possession of it . We need your abilities , Paul . It 's not just this one machine . We must accept that every weapon has its time . They will be making advances as quickly as they can . Without your brain , we would fall dangerously behind . Paul . I 'm sure this reading of each other 's minds ... can be controlled , don 't you ? You see , if an enemy knows our exact capabilities ... that leaves us open to surprise attack . Now , that 's a sort of security weakness that might tempt an enemy to move first . We 'd never think of trying to force you , of course . We have your own interests at heart , too , Paul . Yes , we want you to feel a completely free agent ... perfectly at liberty to follow your own convictions . Whatever you do , you 'll be well looked after . We want you to be happy , as well as productive . They 're not human . They 're a superior species . They 'd beat us every time . They 're not human . They 're a superior species . They 'd beat us every time . They 're not human . At this very moment , they could be controlling a bomber crew ... and force them to press the button . That would be it . - I don 't believe it . - You don 't believe it . What gave you the divine right to take a decision ... that could destroy the entire world ? Don 't be so bloody emotional and sentimental ... just because of your feeling about these kids . They 're not kids ! Have you ever seen them laugh , run , play ? No , by God , but you 've seen them kill ... violently and hideously . Have you thought about that , psychologist ? I don 't know what to do . I wish to God I did . We 've got to do something . Come on . I 'm sorry . I was after Dr. Neville . I 'm afraid he 's not here , Professor . - I was rather hoping ... - Is there anything I can do ? - Those cells we saw the other day . - Yes , what about them ? I can 't be certain , of course , but it 's just a hypothesis . Because of the nature of the cells , the size , conformation ... and other factors ... I think they are the cells of man ... advanced maybe a million years . I want plenty of distraction . Keep those vehicles moving till we 're ready . Sir . Command to all stations . Get that truck unloaded and move it out of here . Come on , move . Montez . Yes . Hold on , would you ? It 's for Dr. Neville , sir . A Dr. Lewellin and Prof. Gruber to see him . Gruber ? Dr. Lewellin discovered Paul Looran ... and Prof. Gruber 's the head of my department at the university . Right . Send them up . - Get on with that thing . - Sir . Finished , sir . Right . Test the circuit . Signal station . This is a test . Prepare for firing signal . Test signal received . Circuit functioning A-OK . Good . Bring the armored units into firing position . All stations . Readiness report . G Station ready and standing by . C Station ready and standing by . J Station ready and standing by . M Station . He 's not out yet . Detonator crew . He 's not out yet . - Dr. Lewellin 's here , sir . - M Station not yet operational , sir . What do you mean , they 're not operational ? - Let me talk to them . - Sir . This is the commander . The Minister of Defense , the Chief of Staff , and Colin have all been killed horribly . There 's been murder and chaos in four embassies . That was the chance you gave them . They did that and then came back here ? Yes . We hope that 's the one mistake they 've made . What sense is there in that ? I can 't guess what makes sense to them . Get that line working , or we go without you . Finish the check . Let 's see the area plan . Colin and the others may have made just the same mistake ... as you 're making now , pointed guns at them . - Colin 's not alive to tell me the story . - So that 's the answer , is it ? To put them in a position where they have no choice but to fight back . You were the one that reminded me of what happened in there . Even now , they could be making all those men out there ... turn their guns on one another ! It would be a massacre ! That 's a risk I 'm prepared to take . That 's a risk we 're all prepared to take . The ammunition carriers are withdrawing now . Look , David . Will you listen to me , please ? This is important . Prof. Gruber thinks ... those cells are the cells of man . Man advanced maybe a million years . Possibly . Yes . That 's possible . But we 're ape advanced a million years ... and from what I 've seen , we need protection against man ... advanced a million years . Either we control them , or they control us , and that 's the law of nature , Tom . Ask any ape . - M Station 's still not ready , sir . - Does Mr. Harib know about this ? Mr. Harib 's already down there in the car . With him is a volunteer from each of the embassies . Not only are they agreed on this action , but they 're also agreed that if it works ... it 's worth the risk of their lives , and ours . I think you ought to keep an eye on Dr. Lewellin . M Station to Command . He 's got the charges in place ... but he hasn 't got the line out yet . You 're the only station not ready . We can 't wait . Come on , move . The old man 's blowing his top . If he can work any faster in this muck , let him come down and do it himself . I don 't know what happened at the embassies ... but at least hear their side . I was the one that sent them to their embassies . Now bloody stick . Right . Grab it . They 're out . Give us a minute to tie up . You can 't do all this without knowing what they 're after . How do we know why they 're here , what they want ? M Station ready and standing by . - All stations ready , sir . - Right . Inform Mr. Harib we go ahead in 30 seconds . Sir . Commander to Harib . We go in 30 seconds . Right . I 'll take care of this . One , load and prepare to fire . Mr. Harib ? We go in less than half a minute , sir . - You men , stop those people ! - Tom ! Who 's that ? Tom ! Get away from that church ! - Go , get him . - Just a minute , Captain . I 'd like that . Please . Get back ! Only the task force is allowed in the area now , sir . This is my responsibility , Captain . Get back ! You 've got 10 seconds to get him out of there . Count down from 10 , and then push that button . Tom ! Final countdown . 10 ... 9 ... Paul , give me some sign you can hear me ! ... 7 ... - Wait a minute ! It 's Harib ! ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... - 2 ... - Stop the countdown . Check , check , check . Can you hear me in there ?

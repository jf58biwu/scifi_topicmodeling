 - Ok , Venus ? - Ok , Steve . Right . Come on . FASTER THAN LIGHT When you calculate that arrive at Station 9 , Matt ? In about four hours , Steve . The setting you made in stabilizing It seems to have worked , Steve . Robert did not have any more problems . Correcting course . Correcting course . He spoke too soon , Matt . The stabilizers are up again . Best take control . Correcting course . Ok , Robert . Got it . Correcting course . I can not control , Matt . Try the emergency stabilizers . Sim , sim , Ok . Well , that was a great help but spent a lot of fuel . Perhaps we should return to Space City while we can . We are already very close to the station to go back now . I hope that does not happen the worst . This is a lonely job , Major , every man for himself in this corner of space , running at Station 9 in the same direction . Yeah , it 's like that , is not it ? Rather it is one of the old stations that still has a crew . Hey , those supplies have not arrived yet . Better call Space City . Yeah , good idea . Do this . Call Space City . You need to see this , Major . He is talking to himself again . Here is the Space Station 9 calling Space City . Space Station 9 . Just confirming that supplies are the way , Commander . They are on their way . Fireball XL5 is doing a special delivery . Understood . Over and out . I do not know these people from space stations They are always on the radio . Yes , Mr. imagine how it can be lonely there . It really is . Many of them start talking alone . Full crazy . I need to call Miss . Zero . - What is it , Sir ? - Nothing . I , er ... I was talking to myself . Another crazy ... - What did you say , Lieutenant ? - Oh , nothing Sir , I ... I was just talking to myself , Oh , talking to yourself , is not it ? It is , keep it up and you will be a good commander the space station . Give me some peace now . Huh ? No , no , no , no , no . Not you , dear . You asked me to call . Huh ? Sweets for Jonathan ? Well , he may have about four tons . Zoonie locked ? It seems totally lost control . Totally lose control . Totally lose control . I can not keep our course . Matt , any thoughts ? I 'll take a look at the key driver , Steve . Be the nutômico reactor . Okay , Matt . But whatever you do , do quickly . Now remember Matt , even with the costume You can not be more than 10 minutes Masi that the radiation may harm you . Ok , just hope it 's enough . He took his anti-radiation capsule ? Sim . Well , come on . Matt Quick , quick ! It 's getting worse . Pills OXYGEN - How 's it going , Venus ? - He 's still in there , Steve . It only takes two minutes . - Any luck , Matt ? - No . I need to see Steve , fast . Out of control . Out of control . Okay , okay , Robert . Come on . We know . - What discovered , Matt ? - Steve Bad , very bad . There is a chain reaction in the main engine . We will increase the speed and there 's nothing I can do All we can do is wait for it turns itself off . - You can not control ? - No way . Just how far will the Fireball take us . And at the speed he wants . XL5 . Wow ! Space Station 9 calling Space City . The XL5 came by like a shooting star . He must be out of control . Ok Major . We will try to contact them now . Thank you for the warning . Lucky , Ninety ? Nothing , Mr. And our screening instruments are crazy . Keep trying , Ten . We need to find what 's going on there . Rate continues to rise , Matt . I do not like that . At this point , the reactor should have been burned . Take a look at our speed , I will launch interceptors . The launch of strength could slow us Yes , they can act as retro . Interceptor 1 . Five , four , three , two , one , ignition and launch ! It did not help . - Shoot interceptor 2 . - Understood . Five , four , three , two , one , ignition and fire . Steve , this is not working . We need to do something . We need ! Zoonie ! Zoonie , what did you do ? Zoonie , oxygen pills . You took all the oxygen pills ! The XL5 is out of reach , Mr. So will clash in unexplored space , Lieutenant . We can not do anything to help them now . Simply nothing . Hold on , Matt . Steve , our speed ! Let 's break the light barrier . We are to break the light barrier ! Quer que eu pare a busca do XL5 , Sr ? Stop searching ? Gone mad ? Have you ever thought that there are human lives at stake ? Yes , Mr. I 'm just obeying orders . You told me to stop the searches ... Do not tell me what I said , Lieutenant . So keep looking . Think ... think they are still alive , Sr ? I do not know . Perhaps . If they are alive , they are seeing things that no man has seen before . Or you can even imagine . No ; how long we passed out : ? I ... I do not know , Matt . Are you okay , Venus ? Yes , yes , I 'm fine , Steve . You hear that whistle ? You are my ears or really doing ? Oh , you are doing , I 'm listening too . I wanted to know what it is . And where it comes from . Oh , do not be alarmed , Zoonie . Now listen , Matt , Venus . I want a check Full of everything . Let 's find out exactly how we are , okay ? - Ok . - Certo , Steve . I will do medical tests right now . You must be losing pressure . This is bad . According to their calculations , we were traveling at ten times the speed of light . Everything looks the same , the computers say we can come back . You 're right , Steve . The chain reaction stopped , the engines are good , That 's great . And the medical report , Venus ? Well , it does not seem that we have been exposed any type of radiation , and just have normal reactions to excessive speeds . So I think we 're medically fit . Only Zoonie seems to be suffering a little . Oh , really ? Oh , no , no . Only one case of overeating . Eat too much . Why ? Eu badly that lembro me ? Zoonie took all our oxygen pills ! I hope we do not need them . I , er ... I hate to say this , but ... but we need them . We will need them desperately . The XL5 lost a lot of oxygen when meteorites hit us . Oh , Matt . And that 's my fault . No time for that now , Venus . The question is , how long we have , Matt , before they run out our oxygen ? Well , I have more bad news . The supply will last for an hour at most . Well , I guess this is the end of the line . What say we 'll all die . And it 's my fault . Oh , do not say that , Venus . It 's not anyone 's fault . Look , I think we should do our reports . At least we will help astronauts in the future . This is no time to sit waiting to happen . I agree , Steve . One hour . Are you feeling okay ? Matt ? Venus ? - I 'm fine , Steve . - And me too . So what happened ? We should be without oxygen now . Professor , are you sure that your calculations are correct ? Without any doubt , Venus . I checked and re-checked . - So what 's the answer ? - I wonder . I wonder if it is possible ... No you 're thinking , Matt ? There 's the answer . It has air outside . We must be in some kind of ... ocean . Yes , it is . An ocean of air . Well , this is fantastic . It 's Steve , but we were farther into space than anyone was before . Everything is possible here . Yes it 's true . Steve , Steve ! I think Matt 's right . That whistle was to be heard the wind passing through us . The wind , of course . See . Birds ! Giant birds . One of them seems to be interested in us . Do not worry about it , Matt . - Let 's take care of the damage to the ship . - And pumping air into the tanks . Yeah , yeah , we need all possible air to return home . Come on , let 's get the job . Ejecting now . You welcome ! Now , you wait here , Zoonie . We do not want you to create any more problems . I know you , when you 're in the mood . The er ... the greatest cracks are near the Central Control . Ok , Matt . Hello everybody ! That guy is getting closer , Steve . Yeah , as soon as we leave here we will be better . - Steve ! - Eu vi . Rápido Matt , o jatomóvel . Zoonie ! Now calm , Venus . Steve is on the way . No ... do not worry , Venus . He will get them . But as it turned out ? Oh , pobre Zoonie . He will attack the Steve ! He 's fine , Venus ? Oh , he 's fine , just a little scared , that 's all . All right , Steve . Oh , Steve , was an act of great courage . Oh , it was nothing . Now , let 's go . And remember to talk to you about this your Lazoon , if and when we get home . Ok , starting in ten minutes . Launch , five minutes . Reversing course , Robert . Reverse course . Robert is controlling everything . Get ready Launch , three minutes . One minute . Four , three , two , um , zero , Full power the engines . Full power the engines . - Maximum speed . - Maximum speed . - Disparar boosters . - Disparar boosters . Here we go ! Steve ! SPEED INDEX You 're right , Steve ? Yes , yes , I 'm fine , Professor . We are back to the good old space we know . Yeah , but we 're out of fuel . Well , I guess it could be worse , Venus ? Venus , are you there ? She , er ... she 's not responding , Steve . I will talk to her . Then I see him in the laboratory , Matt . Venus , Matt , I remember now . She cried when we passed the light barrier . - Something is wrong . - She 's not well , Steve . She needs to go to the hospital . Easier said than done , Professor . We are in our space but a million miles from Earth . And all our radios are out of action . Very strange . I wonder what could be . We take a closer look ? The XL5 ? Are you sure ? I 'm sure , Commander . But they failed to respond to radio . O XL5 ! Space Rescue Alert ! Divert fuel tanks . High priority . Bring the XL5 . Whatever it takes , bring the XL5 . Way home . - They succeeded , Commander ! - Of course they could . Well , it 's time to be patient , Venus . And I will see to it that stay here until you are well again . That 's right . You need to stay here to recover . Do not worry , it 's what I want . I will make the most of it and take a good , long rest . Thanks for the sweet , Steve . My favorite , Delight Marciana . It is the favorite of someone else too , Venus . Translation - Neverlost

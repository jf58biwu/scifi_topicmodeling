 - Ok Venus ? - Ok Steve . Okay , come on . Prisoner LOST ON THE PLANET The new transmitter ultra high range of Neutroni Matt has a striking appearance . I hope it 's awesome working . That 's what matters . Just imagine . We can receive transmissions Neutroni that no man has ever heard . I think something is coming .. Our first receiving the depths of unknown space . - Looks like a code . - You can increase , Matt ? I uh ... I will compensate for power . You can understand this , Steve ? Ahn , C ... S ... E ... CSE . It is the former Space Relief Call Someone must be in trouble . But this code is no longer used for 20 years . Who do you think can be , Steve ? I do not know . But there 's only one way to find out . Let 's go there ? How can we refuse ? Have you seen Steve Zodiac not help someone in danger ? Very noble if I may say but about what is all this ? Remember , I 'm still in charge here . Yes , sir It 's a distress signal picked up on the new Matt device a sector not mapped . And ? - Well , I thought we should investigate . - That 's what I thought . - Oh , you thought , right ? Well , if this new apparatus Prof. Mattic say you need to investigate each called false then the sooner he blow a fuse is better . Somewhere out there is a danger in living creature . I can not help that a call unanswered . You can Cmte ? Steve está certo , Comandante Zero . Above all it is our job to save lives and help those in need . Well , I tell you : do not like it . But I think I will be accused of grumpy old man was not budge . You are wonderful , Commander . Zodiac can be a crazy cat space but no one can say who has courage . What you do , Ninety , continue following this call for help . If there is any change of position tell Colonel Zodiac immediately . - Understand ? - Yes Sir , Commander . Stay the course 6-2-3-0 Blue . 6-2-3-0 Blue Course . Well , I guess I 'll go back to take a nap . Matic , you 'd better get some sleep while all is well . Arriving in unknown space we have to keep our eyes open . Matic heard it ? Well , what do you know ? You heard it Venus ? Venus ? How can you do this ? It seems the night train to Mars . We are approaching the uncharted space , Steve . Okay , Matt . I will make a final check with the headquarters . Fireball XL5 para Space City . Fireball for Space City . We are in uncharted space . Can confirm distress call before you move out of range ? Exchange . Remains unchanged , Ninety ? - Unchanged , Sr. - Good . Fireball XL5 for Space City . Position unchanged . You should engage in regular radio Neutroni as soon as they exit the mapped space . You 're on your own now Steve and the beard of the Prophet , be careful Okay , Commander . If we are serious problems , we call you . They can capture the Ultra neutroni . Over and out . Venus , as we go into unknown space Better keep an eye on radiation . Or Geiger counter space is ready , Steve . Good girl . Well , come on into the unknown space . They are now on their own account , Completely on your own . I did . That 's Steve . I picked up the distress signal by Neutroni . Good . Do not lose it , Matt . Radiation level Ok , Venus ? Ok Steve . Steve ! - What is it , Matt ? - Danger ahead , Steve . - A meteor belt . - We can work around it ? There is no way , Steve . It is well ahead of us . - So let 's get right to them . - But this is crazy , Steve ! Sometimes ! The radiation level is rising fast , Steve ! We never succeed , Steve ! We will not go back now . But is suicide ! Maybe , but there is someone in danger . We have to get there . Radiation level at 5.6 and rising . Arrest in their safety seats . It will be a turbulent ride . Ok Steve . You are the boss . Robert hold the red 9-4-2-0 course . 9-4-2-0 red . Let 's find our way through . Waiting . Here we go . Hold . We 're almost through . We will make it ! Whew ... We did it ! Ok , can loosen the belts , ladies and gentlemen . Eu ... I do not feel well ... Yikes ! A monster meteorite ! And it 's coming right at us ! That was close . You were a great help , Robert . You pays your moments of silliness at times like this . Here it is . The source of the distress signal . An unknown planet . What a beautiful sight . The beauty is skin deep , remember Let 's see what 's under this cloud cover . I 'll let Robert in orbit if we have problems . In what direction is the signal , Matt ? Well .. It seems that comes from the base of that volcano . We are in some sort of valley . I 'm sure we 'll soon be out . After we pass these mountains . There 's Matt . A perfect place to lodge . I 'll take a look around . Alone ? We are not better go with you ? You are here eye on the instruments . Professor , I 'm worried . And if it 's a trap ? I think it should be an application for real help . Anyway , Steve can take care of . I 'm waiting for you a long time . Long long ago . And then Steve Zodiac , I was exiled by my people , the Space Amazon the last five years . I was his queen , and now , I am now abandoned in exile . Were you alone all this time ? Sim Steve Zodiac , fora as visitas anuais to renew my supplies I have been all alone . At first I thought it was not going to endure the loneliness That 's fascinating . Good idea of ​ ​ Steve leave the radio on . So I decided to use all my free time , Neutroni to develop a transmitter . I 've always heard that the Space Amazon has brains and beauty . Thank you for your kindness ... Steve . She already is calling you Steve . How do you accept that ? So you built a Neutroni transmitter . But now here with you , Steve I will have no more use to him . What you mean ? Because it will take me with you to Earth . To Earth ? But I can not do it . It is impossible . Well done , Steve . Impossible ? I mean ... You come so far , and says it 's impossible to save me ? Yeah , we risk our lives to answer his call but ... we can not take it with us . We can not get her out of this planet . Mas por quê ? Por quê ? Because legally you are a prisoner on this planet , convicted by a court of justice of the Amazon . But I just ... I do not know why it was condemned and I do not care . Perhaps they were very strict about you , But Amazonia and the Earth are members of the United Planets Organization and we are committed to non-interference in internal affairs . Get her out of this planet can be so severe as free bars the Space Penitentiary . This would cause a huge diplomatic incident . You need to understand this . I made a terrible mistake . I understand that now . She 's up to something , that woman . You can ... Can you forgive me , Steve ? Do not even think about it anymore . When returning to Space City , I will do everything to help her . Perhaps his people reconsider and release . You do that ... for me ? Of course . You have suffered enough , I guess . Maybe to work . Let 's toast to this . With Kukala , made with exotic fruits on this planet . My own special recipe . One of the many things I learned to do while I was alone here . Let 's toast ... for justice . And a brave and beautiful lady . Oh , obrigado , Steve . What was this ? What she did to Steve ? The sound that was not good . Now listen to this , the Earth people . Ah , yes . I know I heard everything . Steve Zodiac can not help them . I took care of him . And neither of you will escape this hellish planet . Got that ? Answer . Keep her talking . It 's our only chance . We can not . It is only set to transmit . I can destroy you , Terran and his companion , in the blink of an electronic eye . You and your ridiculous this Fireball Jr . During those years , I gave a good use for my beautiful brain Amazon . I learned the secret to control the volcano . Bombarding atoms with its nucleus , can cause a rash . In a matter of moments will be covered by molten lava . Let 's get it off the ground . Let Teacher , shoot rockets . What is wrong ? The engines ! They do not shoot ! But they had to work . No use , Teacher ! We need to abandon the Fireball Jr with Jetmóveis . Open the hatch , Venus . It does not work , Matt . What we do , Venus ? Should shoot me with an interceptor to have a quick death . That 's it ! That 's the answer . - Shoot an interceptor . - In the volcano ? No ! In the cave . We can prevent the rider activates the volcano . It 's our only chance . But what about Steve ? We have to try everything . If not stop , we will all die . - But ... - No buts , Venus . 1 interceptor and fast ! At least the missile circuits are functioning . 2-4-6-0 toward red . Prepared ignition system . Ignition . So ... Then Dare challenge Afrass the Queen of Amazons . Let 's see who will win . Full force . More power . More power ! She was completely crazy . It worked ! The volcano stopped . - But Steve ... - He 's fine . See . And the next thing I saw was a blast . The launch of the interceptor . I took a kick like a mule of a Martian . I hope I never go through it again Well , what matters is that you 're safe , Steve . Yeah , but ... how do we get out of this planet ? Dig lava or leave the gear behind ? Not at all . Firing rockets lava melt . But the engines are not working , Steve This is no surprise . You did not call the blue circuit . Well something woman . Well , now be careful , Steve Zodiac , or I can be evil as his girlfriend Amazon . Ok Robert , assuma . Professor , I go to the meeting room do Afrass case report . I will send to the Court of Appeals Universal . By the way , how is our prisoner ? She is safe in our space cell , Steve . Well , so it is out of my way . I have been through enough with her . I think she learned her lesson . Luckily came out of that planet . My guess is that will no longer try their tricks . Translation - Neverlost

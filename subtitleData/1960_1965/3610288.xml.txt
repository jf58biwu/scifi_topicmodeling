 " Mothra " ( Mosura ) Typhoon number eight ... Just passing the Caroline Islands ... has developed into a more powerful storm . Its center winds are calculated at 60 meters per second with gusts of 80 meters per second ! It 's traveling at 50 km per hour on a northerly course towards the Japanese mainland ! Attention all stations ! Attention all stations ! The 5400 ton vessel , Genyo-maru is caught near the center of Typhoon number eight ! Please standby for distress signals ! Navigator , what is our present position ? ! We are about four miles east of Infant Island ! What ? Infant Island ? ! - Are you sure ? . - Yes Sir.We 're drifting hat way quickly . Damn ... The typhoon will push us into the radiation ! Captain ! Hold on ! We 've hit a reef ! We 're taking water ! Are you alright ? Abandon ship ! Right ! Abandon ship ! Abandon ship ! They went down around this radioactive area . Hey , our fuel is getting low . This is helicopter JH-20 calling . We 've just made our first pass , over . There doesn 't seem to be any survivors . We are returning to base . Look ? They 're humans ! Helicopter JH-20 calling from sector K in the test area , over . We are flying over Infant Island and have discovered four survivors . Hey ! We 're here ! Hey ! Just a moment please ! Just a moment please ! You will be given a chance for an interview soon enough ! Will we get a chance for an interview ? Let us take some pictures ! That isn 't asking too much ! Wait ! Let us in ! Dr. Harada we 've just completed the tests . We didn 't find radiation on any of them . According to my calculations , this is scientifically impossible . None of you have had any physical problems recently ? Do you know what I 'm saying ? None of you have any pain or inflammation of the joints ? Yes , we 're all fine . Excuse me ... What is it ? The truth is I am a little hungry . That 's because they let us eat a lot on the ship . Hey , hey ! I 'm with the Nitto Newspaper . Nitto Newspaper ? Photographers are not allowed in here . I 'll have to ask for your camera . Ten-chan ! I 'm Fukuda from the Nitto Newspaper . Who are you ? Don 't you know the radiation ... But there 's no emergency , that 's what you said . I 'm right , aren 't I ? I 'm Fukuda , pleased to meet you . Since he 's here , we may as well let them stay . He 's our " snapping turtle " . Snapping turtle ? Oh , sorry ... What she means is when I get a hold of a story for the newspaper , I never let go . About these guys ... Well , it 's big news when they manage to survive radioactive counts of three million . You 'd think they 'd be dead , huh ? So , the first thing you want to know is how they survived a radioactive count of three million ? Yes . This time I would like to ask them myself how they managed to stay healthy in that radioactive area . I want to be sure I fully understand what happened . How could all these men survive in an area so polluted by radiation ? That 's it . It was the red juice they gave us . Red juice ? What is that ? It 's what the natives there gave us . The natives ... Did you say natives ? ! On Infant Island ? ! This will put us on top ! The headline will read , " The Mysterious Natives of Infant Island " . What ? That seems a bit overdramatic . Be quiet . Put in what the Rolisikan ambassador said . The Rolisikan government assures you that we 've thoroughly investigated Infant Island for natives . We 're not sure where they were at the exact time of the atomic blast . Ambassador , are you going to send an expedition ? The Rolisikan government has no plans at this time . I wonder if anyone is an authority on those islands ? Dr. Chuzo should be able to assist us . Chuzo ? He 's an anthropologist . He led the Polynesian expedition several years ago . Good . Let 's set up an interview right away . I 've already contacted him and sent Misgi to get a photo of him . That was stupid ! What does it look like ? It 's terrible ! - How is it ? What the heck is this ? That 's a great shot ! He doesn 't like being photographed . What a problem ... I have a feeling this is really big ! Hey , Chuzo ... Why won 't you tell us all about the expedition ? You are the leader of the group , right ? You can hear all about it from the Rolisikan government . Take his photo when he looks up . I understand , I understand ... We won 't try to take your photo . At least let us see your face . I don 't have to show you my face . What is it ? What 's going on ? Sorry about that . Hey , Shinji ! Shinji ! Yes ! I told you to keep your pets in your room ! I was looking all over for it ! Chiro ! Come here , Chiro ! Chiro ! Chiro ! Just a moment ... I 'll go and get it , alright ? Don 't hurt yourself ! I 'm fine ... Did you find it ? What 's the matter ? What is it ? ! Here . Thank you very much . Thank you . Let 's discuss the island . You are going on the expedition ? I haven 't heard of one yet . I 'm sure you 'll hear from them . Isn 't it amusing ? This has got to be an incredible discovery for someone like you . It should open a new field of study for you . Well , it should be interesting . All of the Polynesian islanders share a basic language structure and culture . Does that mean that they are similar to the people of Hawaii or Tahiti ? Legends say that the Polynesian people were the descendants of the ancient continent of Atlantis . Do you believe what I 'm saying ? I only believe what I see through the camera . Then believe only in what you see . The sound of a shutter reminds me of the sound of a guillotine . A guillotine ? That 's a good one ! Please be careful ... Just like a guillotine , you 'll never know when you 're hit with a photo . Wasn 't that Dr. Harada ? He 's the leader of the Japanese expedition . Hey , Michi ! Out of the way please . Out of the way . What ? The reporters have been shut out from the expedition ? Who was it that made such a demand ? ! I 'm sure you 're all curious as to why reporters won 't be allowed on this expedition . There 's no particular reason why . We just want the mission to be successful . Then you 're saying that the press would just get in the way ? No , no , no ... You and I see things differently . This mission is my responsibility . I won 't need the services of the press . It 's a good thing you 're out here . I don 't think reporters were allowed in there ! Hey , who is this Nelson guy ? Oh , he 's the leader of the expedition . I know that , but who is he really ? I don 't think he 's a scientist . Why doesn 't he want reporters ? Does he have something to hide ? Don 't you think so ? I do . Then he is suspicious . He 's suspicious . Hey , is that what you think ? Then what do we do about it ? You must be joking ! Good luck ! Good luck ! Ten-chan ! Ten-chan ! Oh , Dr. Harada ... Is your meeting over already ? It 's a good thing that you 're taking it easy . What was the meeting about ? Nelson is not a friendly man . Nelson told me that he wants to see the expedition 's data before it 's released . That 's crazy ! He doesn 't have any scientific background and he wants to have the reports ? I wonder what kind of business he 's in ? Come out ! What are you doing here ? I 'm just cleaning . You were using that to clean ? I found it . What is it anyway ? A Nitto Newspaper reporter doesn 't make a good cabin boy . I thought I was good . Oh , well ... Just a moment . You don 't think I 'm just going to let you walk out of here ? What are you doing here ? What is the meaning of this ? I just wanted to ask if my research has to be passed on to you as well ? Of course . Then , it 's an order from the Rolisikan government ? It 's my requirement for this expedition . Then I 'm ignoring it ! Let 's go . We will be approaching the site of the expedition in a short while . You should you now put on your safety gear to shield you from the radiation . Dr. Harada , how was it ? Did you talk to Nelson ? I convinced Nelson to let him come with us as long as he agreed not to do any reporting . You could say I 'm your cabin boy . Excuse me . I 'm Fukuda , with Nitto . Here ... Thanks . Here ... Dr. Harada ... Why hasn 't anyone decided to stand up against Nelson 's control ? Even Dr. Roth reports to him , huh ? Is that what you say ? Then , if Dr. Roth ... I 'm a cabin boy . Sorry ... It is now time for us to go ashore . I hope each and every one of you does your best to make this expedition a great success . Now , if any of you encounter any problems the button on your right shoulder is a silent alarm transmitter . Do not use it unless you are in urgent need of assistance , and we 'll go to your location . Please be patient in your research . Dismissed . Chuzo ! What do you think you 're doing ? ! I 'm lost . What ? I am lost ! I have been looking for Chuzo . What in the world did I step into ? This isn 't normal growth . They all look like fungus . That 's it , they 're all giant fungus . The survivors must have drank their juice in order to stay alive . I 'm not sure which direction we should go from here . It 's amazing ... Doctor ! I can 't seem to find Chuzo . That way ! Chuzo ! What 's wrong ? Chuzo ! Chuzo ! Chuzo ! Hang in there ! Chuzo ! Chuzo ! Chuzo ... Chuzo ... Hello . Don 't say that ! What happened ? A blood-sucking plant attacked me . That 's it ... And then I was saved by two small women . Small people ? You 're sure you didn 't see children ? No . I thought they were about 30 centimeters tall . I could swear they were girls no larger than dolls ! What ? Doll women ? You sure that you didn 't imagine this ? No ! They were real ! Well , we can 't go back tonight . We 'll have to go back first thing in the morning . Hey , how did these beauties come by to help you ? Beauties ? Oh , it 's a journalist term . You had a vision of two young ladies . We like to call them beauties . I got it ! Huh ? What is it ? That 's it ! Well , good night . How 's that for gratitude ? How can I interview you this way ? Jeez , I must be slipping . What 's the matter ? Chuzo ! - What 's happening ? I think this has gone too far . I 'm not playing games . I was wondering how they found me last night when I figured that they were attracted to the sound of my alarm . A song ! They 're communicating by song ! No , that 's not a song . It 's their way of speech . I 'm not sure how they 're doing it but it 's an unusual form of language . Can you understand what they 're saying right now ? It sounds like they want us to leave their island alone . Oh , of course ! They want us to take our atomic tests somewhere else ! There will definitely not be any more nuclear tests . You 're very rude ! What do you think you 're doing ? ! I know movie producers who would want these girls . Release those two girls this instant ! Doctor ! Nelson ... Natives ! They 're coming ! They 're over here too ! Retreat ! Retreat ! Release them now . I have what we came here for ! Well , don 't expect us to fight for you . Sentries put down your weapons . Put down your weapons ! Boss , what do we do ? Are you sure ? Give them to me . Let 's get back to the ship ! Return to the ship ! - Fall in ! Hey , doctor ... I wasn 't sure what to think at first but I think we 're lucky to come to this island . The ship has finally docked . The investigative team led by Nelson , the meteorologist , traveled to study the mysteries of life . What amazing stories will they have to report ? A special event ? It wasn 't just a special event . They went to an island hit with three million counts of radiation ! What happened to Fukuda ? I want you to find him ! Ten-chan ! Welcome back ! Welcome back . Thank you for going there . Is this what happened to you all this time ? I was very worried about you ! The desk editor is furious ! Come on . Was this your only trip to the island ? Why didn 't we receive more reports ? Hey , wait a minute ! You can 't leave without telling us anything ! Clark Nelson . Date of birth and birthplace , unknown . Pre-war history is unknown . In 1954 , he traveled to the Amazon in search of a native tribe there . Although the mission was a failure , he was praised for a job well done . I 'm thinking doesn 't he seem like an international art broker to you ? An art broker ? Sure ... The type who seeks out ancient art and steals it to sell . It 's a profitable business ! Doesn 't that seem like a far-fetched idea ? Right . But this guy ... Guess what map I found when I was caught in his room ? Infant Island . Fukuda , I found something strange on the island . Fukuda , here it is . What is it ? What is this ? I found this on a rock beyond a cave I discovered on Infant Island . A cave ? Did you say you found a cave ? It was an unusual cave . I would have told Dr. Harada about it but Nelson was always around . The same symbol is all over this thing . I think the message is a reference to it . Through the use of my manuals on all of the Polynesian dialects I think I know what it is . Then what does the symbol mean ? Mothra . Huh ? Mothra ? What could that mean ? I don 't know . You 're both very cute girls . I 'm glad that I could see you again . Boss ! The natives ! Fire ! Fire and then retreat ! Mothra ... Mothra ... Mothra ... How long have you been our " snapping turtle " ? Five years , three months . What ? ! And you saw these girls on Infant Island ? Don 't say that ! Why didn 't you file the story ? ! Well ? Well , we didn 't want them to get hurt . Damn ! That 's your problem to deal with ! The scientists are human . What ? The entire expedition group agreed to it but we didn 't expect this guy to put them into showbiz ! These girls are human ! We didn 't want them to get hurt ! I 'm a human , too ! Welcome , everyone . We are living in the atomic age . But people , does that mean there are no mysteries of life ? Have all of its wonders become obsolete ? No ! Life is not without its mysteries ! - Let 's go up front . This mystery is not a dream . Tonight you will see the original life , the original mystery ... It is what I 've discovered in my journey to the South Pacific . I hope you enjoy the two lovely fairies . Did you come alone ? No , my father is somewhere in the back . I spoke with Dr. Roth earlier today . It seems the Rolisikan government wasn 't too enthusiastic about our expedition . Oh , they were having financial difficulties , huh ? All of the financing was provided by Nelson . So , he was your sponsor ? No wonder why he wanted to come along . That melody ... Well , stop your meddling . Please go home . I 'm not meddling . I want an interview ! Well , that 's enough for me . I don 't want you to know anything more about my mysterious ladies . Hey ! What are you doing ? No ! No ! I 'm not leaving ! - You 're going now ! What 's going on ? Ten-chan ! Nelson ! It 's been a while , huh ? I need to talk to you . Talk ? Stop this inhumane show . Return the girls to their island . Inhumane ... ? You 're crazy ! We make sure they get the best of everything ! These two mysterious girls aren 't just human beings , they 're genuine treasures . What are you saying ? My paper will tell all about what you 're doing here ! You do and we 'll sue you for slander ! Then why don 't you tell me how much this fiend profits from using these girls like slaves ! Slaves ... ? Don 't be ridiculous ! Do you think we use them like that ? My mysterious girls wouldn 't sing if they weren 't happy . Then where are the girls ? Well , I don 't know if this is right , but I 'll let you see them for just 3 minutes ! If you 're wondering if the girls are happy , you can see for yourself . Miss , the camera , please . I have all the advertising I need . You 're so rude ! You can have it ! Please don 't be worried . Oh , they 're pretty ! Do you understand me ? I 'm the one you saved from the blood-sucking plant . Hey , they look so frightened and scared . Why don 't we try to free them ? No . We don 't want Nelson to realize what we plan to do just yet . But I don 't like that guy . We all feel the same way about that ! Hey , I hope you 're doing well . We don 't think anyone in the world has the right to hold you like this . Thank you . The two of us do not wish to be here . You finally understand what we 're saying ? We do not have a use for words . We understand through feelings and ideas . Telepathy , huh ? Telepathy , right ! We truly want to return home as soon as possible ... But ... But , what ? She will come to rescue us regardless of what happens to your country and that fills us with great sadness . Great sadness ? What 's happening ? Mothra is coming . Mothra ? Mothra is coming here to rescue us . Mothra open your eyes . Mothra your people are in need of you . We need you to awaken for us now . Look at this story ! I want a retraction ! Anyway , you 're paper had no right printing this story . It is my newspaper 's responsibility to report the truth . Alright , you won 't retract it for me , huh ? I 'm going to the Rolisikan ambassador . Your company will have big problems then . Editor , this just came over the ticker-tape machine . A large object unidentified , floating in the South Pacific . What does it mean ? Mothra is coming . Mothra . What the hell is a Mothra ? Infant Island has a legend , about a huge protector ! It 's coming to rescue the girls ! That 's just a load of garbage to sell newspapers . I heard it directly from the girls ! What ? He 's not lying . Mothra is coming to rescue the two girls . Everyone , what you are hearing , is one of the great wonders of life . The only way to enjoy this spectacle is to hear it for yourself . Hard to port ! - Hard to port ! Shut up ! All of you just shut up ! You want us to shut up ? ! I 'm not the one responsible for destroying the Orion ! This has no relation to me . That 's how it is . We have nothing to do with an attack that was caused by a monster . Is that so ? If you weren 't holding onto the girls , Mothra wouldn 't be coming here ! Coming to Japan ! To Tokyo ! Think of the destruction ! Stop spreading lies ! Your opinion is wrong . Nelson ! Be quiet ! Regardless of what you say , it 's pointless . If you push this any further , we 'll report you to the Rolisikan embassy . You don 't want to be indicted by them , do you ? Indicted ? Fine by me ! Arrest us if you can ! Chuzo , it seems hopeless . I hate to say it , but it looks bad for those two . But , if we saw them once more ... Once more ? Let 's go talk to the girls . What is it ? We want to talk to the girls . You can 't ! No one goes in without the boss ' approval ! I understand . You think I 'm joking ? ! You ... ! Stop it . Stop it ! I wish you would just cooperate ! What 's going on here ? ! Damn you ! This can 't be helped . I 'll take care of these guys . Hurry ... Go talk to the girls . Thank you . Let me go ! Let me go ! Let me go , I said ! You 're dealing with the Snapping Turtle ! I 'm not just a simple fast-talker ! Is there no way that you two can prevent this from happening ? Don 't you have a way that you can control Mothra 's strength ? Mothra has no way to understand . Mothra is coming to us through her own instincts . Really ? There 's really no way you can control her ? We 're very sorry but there 's nothing we can do . That 's it ! Once more ! It 's telepathy ! Can telepathy be stopped ? Can you do it ? We 're testing something now that might be able to help us . This material was designed with the hope that it could prevent radio waves from affecting the oscilloscope . I see ... If we could put them in a box made of this , Mothra may not know where to find them . I 've found it ! It 's about a hundred meters long ! Position ? Okay , 137 degrees , 2 minutes north . 23 degrees , 10 minutes east . Its current speed is 11 knots , heading for Tokyo ! Scramble our first air squadron . We 're right on top ! What ? The lawsuit against us ? Oh , that 's just a distraction . Well , we 'll be there to cover the Mothra battle . Alright . Well , I feel sorry for Mothra . What ? It 's all Nelsom 's fault ! If he would just release ... Damn ! What 's the matter ? The Rolisikan government is supporting Nelson ! What ? The Rolisikan government states that it is obliged to protect the rights of its citizens abroad . Head to the defense office . Find out their plans ! Target sighted . Open bomb bays ! Bombs away ! Bombs away ! Everything you 've tried was useless . Are you certain that Mothra is really dead ? Of course , but I 'm not worried about that . I 'm not so sure that she is gone so take the box with you as a simple precaution . Yes , yes ... In case I 'm wrong . It 's certainly not for your sake ! Hey ! Excuse me . We 're only interested in protecting others from your selfishness . That 's why we 're giving you this box to stop them using their telepathy . It 's to prevent any misunderstanding . I 'm here ! Thanks for coming . I am very lucky ! You 're kidding . What ? Between god , prayers and my friends I 'm not chivalrous enough to go against Mothra for this pay ! Well , you 're not alone there . Is that an earthquake ? It doesn 't feel like one . Thank you , thank you . Well , I don 't think that I 'll need it , but I 'll use the box as you suggest . How about it ? The show is about to start . No . Oh , you won 't need any money . You can all be guests on my behalf . Mr. Nelson , it 's the phone for you . Just a moment , please . Hello ? This is Nelson . Huh ? What ? Cancel it ? ! The Japanese Police are cruel ! Why should I cancel it ? Then go ahead and get it ! How rude ! Ten-chan ! You don 't know what happened ! I know , I know ... Nelson was called to cancel the show . You 're wrong ! Something happened at Dam number three ! The dam ? Incredible ... Mothra ! It may destroy it ! Let 's hurry ! Let 's go ! What 's that ? ! It 's breaking ! Run ! Run away ! Stop it ! Alright ! I don 't know how , but your pet is not taking you back to your island ! Be quiet ! I won 't tell you any more ! In the case . Get away ! Halt ! Halt ! Halt ! Halt ! Halt ! Halt ! Halt ! Stop ! Stop ! Doctor , it has to be Mothra ! - Here , hold this for me . How did she get here ? You can 't do this ! You must leave the bridge ! It 's no good ! Leave ! Leave ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Look out ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Ten-chan ! Mothra is angry because Nelson is holding the two small girls against their will . For their sake , I am taking them from him . I hate Nelson . Where could he have gone ? What 's the matter ? A kid managed to get in the building . He was wearing a red cap . That kid could be a problem . Damn that Mothra ! Anyway , we have to get rid of that kid for our own sake . Hurry ! I 'm going to let you go . Thank you but Mothra is coming for us . You should hurry and get away ! I 'll be alright ! When I get you home my brother will return you to your island . You bastard ! How could you let him get away ? ! Idiots ! What 's going on here ? ! Well , a kid broke into the building and ... Go find that kid ! Find him now ! There he is ! Hey ! - Wait ! Hey , you ! Wait ! - Get back here ! Did you find him ? We can 't find him anywhere ! Damn ! Where did he go ? ! Boss ! Here he is ! Idiot ! Editor ! The Rolisikan government is backing down ! The Rolisikan government is afraid of losing its ties to Japan and is ordering Nelson to release the girls ! Alright ! You 're the top ! I 'm going over to the theater ! I want to see the look on Nelson 's face ! It 's terrible ! I know , I know ! Wait for me here ! Hey ! Chuzo ! What brings you here ? What 's going on ? Nelson 's about to be spooked ! My little brother said he was coming here to free the two girls . Huh ... ? Hold this ! Fukuda ! This is Shinji 's ! You don 't suppose ... Shinji ! Shinji ! Shinji ! Hey ! - Shinji ! Shinji ! Shinji ! Shinji ! Brother ! You 're safe now . Are you okay ? Brother , I let you down ! It 's alright ! Don 't worry , Nelson will get what 's coming to him . Hey , it 's terrible ! I know . Nelson , right ? What are you saying ? ! Mothra 's on her way here ! What did you say ? Mothra ? Where ? ! She 's making her way toward Tokyo ! Mothra 's passed Mount Fuji and is heading for the city where Unit 2 is waiting . Roger . Yes , Unit 2 is ready . Waiting for orders . Unit 3 is moving into position within the city . With Mothra approaching residents of the Shibuya ward are asked to evacuate to the emergency shelters . All residents of Shibuya please evacuate your homes and make your way to the emergency shelters . Fall back ! Fall back ! Boss , this way is no good ! Perhaps it would be better if we went toward the sea ? Turn around . I have an idea . ... Ameike , Akasaikami . Those areas have just been evacuated . Let 's try to stop it there . It 's currently at Goma 2-1 . Mothra is making its way toward Tokyo Tower . All of the local population there has been evacuated . Ready to fire ! Ready to fire ! Wait for the commander 's orders ! Yes , sir . Our unit is ready to attack . Roger . Stand by ! What 's that ? Base , base ! Mothra is building a cocoon ! Mothra will grow in the cocoon until it 's ready to leave . That 's probably how they 'll return to Infant Island . General , has Nelson been found ? He was last seen at the theater , but no one has seen him since then . Boss ... You 're George Walker , with the Rolisikan ambassador . Alright ? Excuse me . Editor ! I 'm not paying you to sightsee ! How about Mothra making a cocoon ? What about Nelson ? I haven 't found where he is . Do I have to play " G-Man " for you , too ? This Mothra in front of us isn 't a story ! Your behavior is disgraceful ! There hasn 't been any sighting of Nelson up to now ! The first thing Nelson would do is to get on jet bound for Rolisika either tonight or tomorrow . How would that be possible ? I 'm sure he could pull a few strings . He 'll do anything to keep the girls away from Mothra . Let 's go to Hanada Airport ! Excuse me . The military command of the Rolisikan government is willing to loan you its best offensive weapon . These atomic heat cannons will they be here in time to assist us ? Please relax . They will be here within ten hours . With Mothra cocooned on Tokyo Tower the army intends to surround the creature while it 's dormant . They hope to launch an attack while it is asleep to end this confrontation without a large assault . The Japanese and Rolisikan governments hope the atomic heat cannons will do the job . In front of us , Mothra is not moving . The attack will begin shortly . Hey ! Incredible ... We will begin our attack at 10 : 00 . Your attention please ! Your attention please ! The military will begin its attack at 10 : 00 ! When the atomic cannons begin firing it is recommended that you wear your protective glasses ! Attacking in sixty seconds ! Ten-chan , your glasses . Thirty seconds ! Twenty seconds ! Ten seconds ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... There is no doubt everyone , that the cocoon was ... Boss , with no one to follow us , we should be alright . You 're right . We 're not in Japan anymore . This is my home in Rolisika . Mothra would never figure out that we would hide on a farm . It appears that the monster known as Mothra has been defeated . A military commander is heading towards a microphone . Everyone ... everyone in the entire world , please wait . Mothra has been confirmed dead ! Boss , boss ! We 're safe now , huh ? Well , sing ! Keep singing ! You 'll sing a long time before Mothra shows up ! Chuzo ! Look ! Mothra seems to be heading for Rolisika . Right , doctor ? Well , Nelson won 't be safe in Rolisika . Rolisikan patrol jets are in the sky searching for Mothra . On that matter , public opinion of the Rolisikan people have turned against Nelson as this continues . The Rolisikan police have been instructed to arrest Nelson on sight , and they are actively ... Boss , this won 't work ! If we go out there , we 'll be picked up for sure ! Hey , I have something important to tell you . What are you doing here ? I 've been asked to help the Rolisikan government . Don 't tell me that they want our help in trying to speak to Mothra ? You 're right . I 'm right ? ! Sure ... What could we possibly say to it ? No , our problem is the girls . We 're the only ones that they 've spoken to that they seem to trust . I see ... But where do we find the girls ? First of all , we find Nelson and they 'll be happy to return to Infant Island . Your attention please . We 've just learned that Mothra has been sighted in the Newkirk City area . Boss , I don 't like this plan . Chuzo , what do we do now ? Should we open it here ? No ! How would Mothra react if she knew they were here ? We shouldn 't put these people through that ! Newkirk City is in bad shape . Chuzo ... Do you remember this ? Oh , the symbol on Infant Island ? That 's right . Look up there ! I get it ! That symbol must have some special significance with Mothra . Right . Hey , those bells ... They remind me of the girls songs . Chuzo , is there any way that we can use this mark and the sound of the bells ? Mothra and the sound of prayers ... And songs ... Alright , let 's do it . We need you to have this symbol drawn as large as possible on the airport runway . This ? Yes . We need it as soon as possible . We 'll do it . And then , can you get the church bells of every town to ring at 3 : 00 ? You want them to ring at 3 : 00 ? Yes . Okay , I 'll see what I can do . Do you think it will work ? Well , I don 't doubt the power of prayer . It 's not so mysterious , but it 's all up to god , now . Well , we better get going . It 's 3 : 00 . I 'm not sure ... But it seems to be quiet . It 's coming this way ! Is it okay ? Alright . It 's landing . Thank you , everyone . We pray that our land and yours will live in peace and harmony . Thank you . We promise not to disturb the peace of Infant Island . Thank you . Mothra is waiting for us . Goodbye ! Take care . I 'm not sure if we 'll have peace and harmony , but we 'll do fine . Goodbye . Goodbye ! Goodbye ! That 's it ! I 've got to call the editor ! It 's a top story ! Oh , no ! - Huh ? I didn 't get a picture ! It 's alright ! The path of peace is yours to discover for eternity .

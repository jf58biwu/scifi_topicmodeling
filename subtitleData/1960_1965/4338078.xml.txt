 - [ Typing ] - [ Phone Rings ] Sí . Sí , es muy importante . No , no . No más tarde . Ahora . ¡ Bien . ! - Gracias . Mr. Tobin . - Yes . Contact our destroyer . Tell ' em to stand by . Oberhansly , press corps . I 'm with the official party . Larry , what 's the big delay ? You 've got a half a million people waiting out there . - Plans have changed , Joe . - They 've changed ? - Let 's just call it a security matter . - What about the motorcade ? Do me a favor . Save the questions . Don 't push . Don 't play reporter . When it 's time to release the story , I 'll give you the whole scam . - I know that , but I ... - Take my word for it . It 's big enough to warrant a little patience , even from you . [ Sighs ] Have the corridors cleared . I hate to think what this could mean to the Geneva conference . We 'll need a cover story . He 's the one man who can keep peace at that conference . Remember what nearly happened first in 1971 and then last year ? What 'll we tell them , Mr. Secretary ? Tell ' em anything ... anything but the truth . I only wish we could make arrangements with the local hospital . - That 'd be a dead giveaway to the press . - Larry 's right , Doctor . If this story leaks , we 'll have an international panic on our hands . I hope your plan works . Are the arrangements complete ? All set . He 'll be transferred to a destroyer in the harbor . The copter 's waiting . He mustn 't be airborne longer than 30 minutes . He wouldn 't survive it . - How much time do we have , Doctor ? - Well , without surgery ... I 'd give him about 36 hours at the most . Thirty-six hours . And Washington still has to assemble the surgical team . The destroyer will put to sea , meet the surgeons as close to home as possible . Good . That 'll save a lot of time . - If it can be done in secrecy . - It has to be done . This isn 't my life or yours that 's at stake . This happens to be Henry Talbot McNeal , the president of the United States . [ Man ] Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea . Starring Richard Basehart ... David Hedison . Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea . Ready to go ashore , Admiral ? For a secret emergency mission , we seem to have a welcoming committee . Norfolk , Virginia ... very hospitable town . Well , George , didn 't expect to find you in Norfolk . - Official business , Admiral . - Uh , Commander Crane , this is General Beeker . We 'll need one of your crewmen ... one with double " A " security . Kowalski . - Sir ? - [ Crane ] Come along with us , please . - Aye , aye , sir . - May I ask where we 're going , General ? - I 'm not at liberty to say . - If you don 't mind , I 'd like a minute to dismiss my crew . Your crew is restricted to the submarine till further notice . - On whose authority ? This is a civilian ship . - Mine . Is that good enough ? Thank you . Won 't you sit down ? [ Door Opens , Closes ] Been in the navy long , sailor ? Oh , I 'm not in the navy anymore . I work for a research outfit . Really ? Must be very interesting work . Eh , it 's a living . How long do these meetings generally last ? I wouldn 't know . The regular receptionist is out sick today . - I 'm from the steno pool . - Oh ? [ Beeker On Speaker ] Briefly , gentlemen , our problem is this : The president , immediately following his current goodwill tour of South America ... had planned to visit the NATO countries and attend the summit meeting in Geneva . That meeting is scheduled for exactly one week from today . His presence is absolutely essential , and it 's become our responsibility to get him there : yours , mine , Dr. Taylor 's and Dr. Kranz 's . I don 't quite understand . Is this a political or medical problem ? Unfortunately , Commander , it 's both . The president is acknowledged to be the key figure at the conference . It 's his personal influence alone that prevents some of the major powers ... from tearing up their peace treaties . Politically , his presence at the meeting is absolutely essential ... but medically , he 's in no condition to attend . The president took a bad fall this morning . He sustained severe head injuries . - How serious ? - Dr. Kranz . The diagnosis is a subdural hematoma ... a blood clot under the lining of the brain . It exerts undue pressure on the brain and must be dissolved or removed as quickly as possible . - Meaning brain surgery . - Dr. Taylor . It is hoped that surgery can be avoided through the use of the MG-Q . That 's a machine that I 've developed to dissolve these hematomas . Of course , if this doesn 't work , we will then resort to surgery . Naturally , we won 't release this news until after the president is out of danger . There are a few world leaders who 'd be delighted to hold the conference without him . If the president doesn 't recover by the scheduled date , they 'd take over the meeting . What are the odds that either surgery or the ray treatment will be successful ? Well , with Dr. Kranz and Dr. Taylor ... And the Seaview , we have a good fighting chance . [ Beeker ] Yes , gentlemen . The Seaview can solve several of our problems . We can keep a tight reign on security . Her medical facilities are further advanced than anything afloat . She can transport the surgical team quickly in complete secrecy ... and have all the equipment ready to use the moment the president comes aboard . - [ Crane ] Where will that occur ? - You will rendezvous ... with a destroyer in the Caribbean at a prearranged time and place . - [ Safe Door Opens ] - C.N.O. is outlining your course . Soon as details are worked out , your own courier will deliver sealed orders . You will open your orders with this key . This is the only duplicate in existence . How soon can we plan on leaving ? All arrangements are under way . You may expect the sealed orders within a matter of hours . We have learned that the American president is gravely ill ... and intelligence indicates there is the possibility of an emergency operation . We must have full and complete details at once if we are to exploit this crisis ... to our fullest advantage . I expect an immediate report . [ Buzzes ] - Yes , sir . - Send in the courier , please . Right away , sir . - You may go in now . - Thank you . - I was told to report to you , sir . - Yes . Your left arm , please . Admiral Nelson is waiting for these orders aboard the Seaview . - You will deliver this container of microfilm to him personally . - Yes , sir . We 've taken certain precautions . You will follow the prescribed route exactly . That 's it . - All finished ? - Yeah . Boy , I gotta run . Look , if I get shore leave , uh , maybe we could have dinner together . Well , um , maybe . - So long for now . - Bye . L-R-O to 7-X-35 . L-R-O to 7-X-35 . Confirm . Courier will travel by motorcycle ... over prescribed route . L-R-O to 7-X-35 . Out . [ Motorcycle Crashes ] [ Straining ] [ Grunts , Shudders ] [ Vehicle Approaching ] [ Engine Stops ] - What happened to you ? - [ Yelps ] [ Groans ] My cycle . I ... [ Zipper Unfastening ] [ Machinery Humming Softly ] [ Humming Continues ] [ Shutter Clicks ] Take this one for decoding . - Now one more . - [ Shutter Clicks ] Now let 's get him back . [ Groaning Softly ] - How long was I out ? - A minute or so . Thanks . [ Engine Starts , Revs ] - Hold it . Where are you going ? - To report to Admiral Nelson . - On whose orders ? - General Beeker . - Your name ? - Kowalski . - [ Knocking ] - Come in . Reporting as ordered , sir . - What happened to you ? - Ah , my ... my cycle threw me , sir . I ... - I hit a rut and took a header . - You all right ? - Oh , yes , sir . Nothing broken . - You weren 't , um , intercepted ? No , sir . I didn 't lose more than a minute or so ... and some skin off my nose . Well , last thing we want now is an accident ... any kind of an accident . - Well , then it 's actually settled , Dr. Taylor . - Oh , yes , Laura . I 'm to go to Norfolk at once and board the submarine . I 'm ... not at liberty to give you any other details . Of course . Of course , I understand . I don 't know how long I 'll be away , but I know the clinic will be in good hands . - I 'm leaving you in full charge . - I will not disappoint you . And have a good trip , Dr. Taylor . - Well , let us say a successful trip . - Yes . - Good-bye , Laura . - Good-bye . - [ Tires Screeching ] - Dr. Taylor ! - [ Man ] It was hit and run . Did anyone get the number ? - Get a doctor . Someone , quick ! A most unfortunate accident ... but a necessary one . Now , the demonstration , please . - [ Switch Clicks ] - [ Machinery Humming ] [ Humming Continues ] Now ... a little closer . A raw egg can be rather messy . Now we focus . Press and ... go ! - That 's it . - [ Humming Stops ] Well , a raw egg exposed to the MG-Q ray for a few brief seconds . Now you can understand the power of this machine . - Can I have an ashtray , please ? - Mm-hmm . Without damaging the outer surface ... we can change the molecular structure of a raw egg ... [ Chuckles ] or any other living substance . Dr. Taylor designed this machine as a curative radiological instrument . Now , let me explain something to you . - The , um , MG-Q reactor , you see , adds a magnetic element to the Q-ray . - Mm-hmm . - Now , radioactive isotopes ... Could you please help me ? - Oh , certainly . are injected into the patient 's bloodstream . Used at , um , normal intensity , see , the magnetic ray ... brings the radioactivity of the isotopes into play on the malignant tissue ... or the hematoma or whatever it is we wish to dissolve . At normal intensity . But if the ray is intensified to this extreme ... surely they will know that something is wrong . No . See , they won 't know . They 'll have no idea ... that I have increased the power of this machine to a destructive level ... because the gauges and the dials , they show normal readings . - When I turn on this designated switch ... - [ Machinery Humming ] the power shows normal intensity . Now , when I turn on this ... hidden switch ... the curative ray becomes , in effect ... a death ray . [ Humming Stops ] Once the machine is in the operating room ... all I have to do is to turn on this hidden switch . Your instructions are clear . There must be no suspicion of anything but death by natural causes . - [ Rings ] - Excuse me . - Sure . - It will result in a brain hemorrhage ... - [ Rings ] which could be attributed to any number of causes . Dr. Rettig speak ... Yes . Thank you very much . - [ Handset Settles In Cradle ] - That was from the hospital . Dr. Taylor died a few minutes ago . He was a very fine man . All right , gentlemen . Here 's the course that 's been assigned to us . South by southeast to this position , just off the Virgin Islands . We 're to run submerged all the way , maintain an average speed of 40 knots . They 've calculated our speed so that we 'll arrive at the point of rendezvous ... the same time as the destroyer . - At what point do we surface ? - We don 't . The president and any other passengers ... will be transferred from the destroyer to Seaview by means of a diving bell . Underwater transfer ? That 's pretty risky . Not as risky as being spotted by a plane or a trawler nosing around in international waters . Let 's see . At 40 knots we should get there in about , um , 13 hours . Excuse me , Captain . The surgical team has reached the dock area . Thanks , Curley . Engine Room , stand by to get under way . - [ Man On Speaker ] Standing by , sir . - Alert the crew . - We 'll get under way as soon as our passengers are aboard . - Yes , sir . Stand by to prepare to get under way . Station a special sea detail . - Dr. Kranz , good to see you again . - Thank you . This is Dr. Adams , my anesthesiologist . I 'll have your luggage taken aboard . These are personal things . Just a routine precaution . Welcome aboard . We 'd like to look over the equipment before you get under way . All right . This way . - Your name , please ? - Laura Rettig , radiologist . - I am taking Dr. Taylor 's place . - Yes , I know . - Well , welcome aboard the Seaview , Miss , uh ... - Rettig . Dr. Rettig . Ah , yes . Dr. Rettig . Lieutenant Baker will show you to your quarters . [ Morton On Speaker ] Prepare to cast off all lines . - We 're out of the harbor now . Take her down 200 feet . - Aye , aye , sir . - Prepare to dive . - [ Man On Speaker ] Aye , sir . - All green . - [ Klaxon Blares ] Dive . Dive . Dive . - We 're at 200 . - Very well . All engines ahead flank . Steer course 0-9-5 . All ahead flank . Course 0-9-5 . Uh , Dr. Kranz , I , um ... I assume we 'll be performing an encephalogram on the president . No . Dr. Jamison has already done it aboard the destroyer . He 's located the hematoma . I see . Well , that should save us a lot of precious time . I 'm counting on your MG-Q machine , Dr. Rettig . Well , if it works as it should , I assure you , surgery will not be necessary . I hope you 're right . Dr. Adams and I will inspect the scrubbing facilities just in case . - Excuse us , Dr. Rettig . - Thank you . David ? [ Machinery Humming ] [ Humming Louder ] Depth : 200 , Captain . - Depth : 200 . - Speed : 35 knots . - I ordered 40 . - Yes , sir . I know . My reading here is 35 . Engine Room , my order was 40 knots . How do you read ? [ Man On Speaker ] 40 , Captain , just like you ordered . - Still reading 35 , Mr. Morton ? - Still 35 , sir . - Curley , run a check on those instruments . - Yes , sir . - What 's the course on your gyro repeater ? - [ Man ] 2-3-5 true , Captain . - Mr. Morton , what course are we steering ? - 1-7-0 , sir . This is a better ship than we thought . We 're going in two directions at once . Watches , instruments , compasses ... Something is giving them fits . I don 't know . We might have entered some kind of magnetic zone . Oh . On the other hand , a magnetic zone might have entered us . [ Loud Humming Continues ] [ Humming Softer ] [ Switch Clicks ] - What 's our depth ? - Two hundred feet . - The screen shows we 're a lot closer to the bottom . - Mr. Morton ... what 's our course ? - Still 1-7-0 , sir . - Right on the nose . [ Sighs ] Three chronometers , all different . Dr. Rettig . Dr. Rettig , do you have any magnetic gear in here ? - Magnetic ? - Anything that might affect our instruments . Well , the MG-Q does produce a magnetic ray , but hardly enough to influence your instruments . Have you turned on that machine at all ? - Well , of course , to ... to make sure it was operative . - Mm . Lee , keep an eye on your instruments . Let me know if there 's any reaction . - [ On Speaker ] Very well . I 'm watching them . - Would you turn on the machine ? Yes , of course . - [ Humming Softly ] - Any change , Lee ? No change , Admiral . Sonar , any change in your readings ? - No , sir . No change . - [ Crane ] No change at all , Admiral . All right , Lee . Thanks . Dr. Rettig , I 'm sorry I bothered you . No bother at all . [ Sighs ] Chip ... I want detection devices set up throughout the ship . Hook ' em up with our computer . We may be getting some kind of magnetic feedback . The next time it happens , the computer should be able to triangulate its position . What about our position ? If our instruments have been wrong ... - Get to work on that too , and fast . - Aye , aye , sir . [ Heavy Banging ] [ Banging Resumes ] [ Man On Speaker ] Port ballast controls not responding . Pressure rising . Repair party , lay to on the double ! - Get it open . Quick ! - I can 't . It 's stuck ! Pressure building ' up in all the tanks . - How bad ? - Not good . - Check all points in Damage Control . - Yes , sir . - Sir , pressure 's building up faster than we can handle it . - Unless we can bleed off ... the port-side tanks in minutes , we 'll have an explosion that 'll put us on the bottom . It 's got to be one of the aft controls that 's stuck . Either seven or nine . Ah , it would be ... the most inaccessible part of the ship . - Sir , I could crawl in there and free the gear by hand . - There may not be time . There 's only one thing we can do : Put the plate back and crack the valve . That 'll leave the inner hull open to the sea on this side . It 's the only way we can relieve the pressure in time . Once we do that , we 'll have to race to the nearest port or sink on the spot . It 'll be the end of this mission . I 'd like your permission to go in there and try it . I 'm sure I could make it . You better know what you 're up against before you decide . Once that needle climbs three points past the red line ... I have no choice but to open the valve and flood the compartment ... even if you 're still in there . - I 'll take the chance , sir . - [ Crane ] Pressure 's gone up another point . [ Coughs ] [ Coughing ] Minor damage all over the ship . - Stand by to crack the valve . - With Clark in there ? - Stand by ! - Yes , sir . [ Coughing ] [ Yelps ] Half point off the red line , sir . Ow ! [ Yelling ] Red line . - Admiral ? - Wait . Clark ! Clark ! Can you reach it ? Clark ! [ Shouts ] Clark ! Lee , I can 't let that needle get three points past the red line . Clark ! Clark ! - Clark ! - [ Yelps ] [ Coughing , Straining ] Clark ! Clark ! I 'm caught ! I 'm caught . I can 't get out of here ! - Clark ! Clark ... - [ Yelps ] - Where are you ? - Here , Skipper . I 'm here . Ah ! - Over here , Skipper ! - All right . ! - It 's breakin ' my arm ! - [ Crackling ] All right ! Hold on ! - [ Grunts ] - Clark . ! - Come on . - [ Grunts ] - All right . Watch it . - Turn . - [ Crane , Straining ] Okay , now , wait . - [ Both Strain ] [ Yelps Loudly ] [ Nelson ] Two and a half points over . We can 't wait much longer . Put the plate back . But sir ... - Put it back ! - [ Sighs ] Yes , sir . - [ Clark ] Don 't pull . - Can you ... - All right . Watch it . - Turn . Break the glass . Break it ! It 's on three . I 'll give them 10 more seconds . Then it 's out of my hands . One , two , three , four ... - A little more . [ Strains ] - Okay . - Okay ? - Yeah . Nine , 10 . Curley . [ Valve Squeaking , Hissing ] Wait ! Wait ! The pressure 's dropping . [ Squeaks , Hissing Stops ] Can you get through it all right ? [ Clark ] Yeah , I 'll make it . I 'll make it . [ Coughs ] He freed the gear . We 're okay . - [ Chuckles ] - We 're okay . ! - Take that plate off and get ' em out of there . - Yes , sir . ! - [ Knocking ] - Yes . I 'm worried , Admiral . Time is running out . Uh , Doctor ... Captain Crane has us back on course . We 've made up most of our lost time already . [ Sighs ] Well , that 's encouraging . - And the instruments ... what went wrong with them ? - We don 't know yet . Well , whatever it was , thank heaven it didn 't affect the MG-Q . - Dr. Rettig tells me everything checks out perfectly . - [ Crane On Intercom ] Admiral . - Yes , Lee ? - Radar reports a surface craft approaching at 2 : 00 . Thanks , Lee . We 're approaching our rendezvous point , Doctor . You 'd better get ready to receive your patient . There she is . Destroyer sighted . Stand by to establish contact . The diving bell is being lowered . Chip , take over . Diving bell sighted , bearing ... 3-4-5 , relative . - Left five degrees rudder . - [ Morton On Speaker ] Left five degrees rudder . - All ahead one-third . - [ Man On Speaker ] All ahead one-third . Depth two double on feet . - Five on feet . - One five on feet , sir . Depth 1-7-5 . Depth 1-5-0 . - Maintain at 1-5-0 . - Maintain at 1-5-0 . - [ Crane ] All stop . - All stop . [ Bang , Scrape On Hull ] Missile Room , stand by for transfer of passengers . [ Morton On Speaker ] Diving bell reports contact secured . Missile Room standing ' by , sir . Escape hatch in operation , sir . [ Valve Hissing ] - Pressure chambers . - Operative . - Hatch doors . - Operative . Proceed with transfer of passengers . Pressure level . Hatches open . Diving bell all-go . All systems green . [ Hissing Stops ] - CommanderJamison . - Welcome aboard , sir . - I 'll be assisting Dr. Kranz . - Over here . - CommanderJamison . - Doctor . Dr. Rettig . Dr. Adams . - Has he been conscious at all ? - Not since this afternoon . Get him into sick bay . Let 's get an I. V. started and prepare the isotope solution . No need to scrub up until after we try the MG-Q . First time I ever saw the president up close . Next time we see him , I hope he looks better ... a lot better . Wish there was something more we could do . We 've done it . It 's up to them now . The results of the encephalogram are rather encouraging , Doctor . The hematoma shows up very clearly , right here . Seems to be in an excellent position for surgery . We can make a lateral incision here ... I 'd rather not operate unless we have to . We 'll try the MG-Q first . Still comatose . Blood pressure low but holding . Dr. Rettig ? - Yes , Doctor ? - The MG-Q , please . Yes . - It will take a few moments to warm up . - [ Machinery Humming ] [ Humming Continues ] His pressure is lower than we 'd like it to be . We haven 't much time . It won 't take long . May I see the X-ray again , please ? [ Humming Louder ] - Sounds a bit too intense . - No . The , uh , readings are normal . [ Morton ] There they go again , Captain . Reading heavy interference , sir . Computer 's busy too . - That should be enough . - [ Switches Click ] - [ Humming Stops ] - Inject the isotope solution , please . - Frame 60 . - [ Crane ] Readings normal again , Admiral . Frame 60 , that 's ... that 's sick bay ! Lee , keep an eye on those dials . If they act up again , yell ! - All yours , Doctor . - Thank you , Doctor . - [ Humming Resumes ] - Position his head , Doctor . [ Humming Louder ] [ Humming Continues ] - What 's all this , Admiral ? - We 've got to stop that machine ! Don 't use that machine on the president ! The power output is ... Stop her ! No ! You won 't stop me now ! [ Humming Stops ] - [ Kranz ] Is he all right ? - He 's all right . - Put this woman under arrest . - Don 't touch me ! If you 're finished with this machine , Doctors ... I 'd be happy to have it removed and taken apart . Let 's get ready for surgery , Doctor . [ Crane ] Maneuvering , remain at dead stop . Maintain absolute trim . For the information of all hands , the surgeons have begun the operation . Another item for your memory book , Lee : a personal thank-you from the president of the United States . - Uh-oh . - Harriman , I 'm afraid I 've got bad news for you . Until further notice , you and your men are restricted to the ship . - Now what ? - I don 't understand , George . The president 's fine . He ... We can 't take chances on this news leaking out ... not until the White House has notified the press . I 'm sorry . You did a great job . Well , let 's go , Lee . We don 't know anyone in Norfolk , Virginia anyway .

 MAGNETO ESPACIAL All tanks replenished . I repeat : all tanks replenished . Right Robert . Ok confirmation . Are you ready to take off as soon as the Fireball XL7 return from patrol . Good . So can read about the race da Liga interplanetary of espaçonaves . I heard it was a tough race . It must have been a great race . We should enter the Fireball . I bet we would draw out their pants . Oh Professor , you can not stop thinking about flying ? Well , what is it more ? Well , I 'm always full of things to do - preaching buttons and washing the bachelors clothing How 've you been . Venus , I do not know what I 'd do without you . Well , how about some coffee , Professor ? Well , only if you insist . Eu I insist . That 's really good . I was really in the mood . Hey , tell Zoon , what 's wrong ? You 're acting strange tonight , Lazoon . It will not take anything , Professor . Hey , what 's wrong with Zoonie ? Something is bothering you , that 's it . Some kind of agitation . Well , Lazoons are known to be very sensitive creatures . He must be feeling that there is something wrong . He 's looking at the sky . Venus Well , he ... he comes from another planet . Perhaps homesick or something . Or maybe there is a problem going on in space . Space City , respond , emergency . Emergency ! Fireball XL7 out of control . Again , Fireball XL7 out of control . What 's going on ? Emergency with Fireball 7 , Steve . What is your position , Fireball XL7 ? Repeat your position . Exchange . It is impossible to say . The instruments do not function . Tell Ross to use the ejectors . It 's your only chance . Eject ! Eject ! Eject ! Emergency ! Eject ! Exchange . Still no respostar . I do not like it . As soon as the moon rises , I will leave to investigate . Professor , I 'm worried . I never saw the Zoonie act like this before . It is , I must admit that it is very strange . But you 'd better get some rest before decolemos , Venus . Yes , I think you 're right , Professor . I 'm going back to Fireball to get some rest . Thanks for the coffee . You know it was time to have a place to live , Professor . No longer enough to see the fireball while It is on patrol , You must go there even being on earth ? Well , I ... I think there is my home . Plus , it 's good enough for me . No , no , do not get up , Venus . I 'm already going . Now , do not worry about the Lazoon , he 'll be fine . Good evening . Good night , teacher . Sleep well . Ah , well , I think I 'll get some sleep . And you Zoonie , are you feeling better ? Now , who could be at this hour ? Hello ? Yes . I see . The teacher just left . He 's coming back para o Fireball . I 'm coming , Steve . I will help you prepare well off the teacher You can get some sleep . All complete check . What time is it now , Venus ? Well , Professor hits that old alarm to call at 9 : 30 and just shoot . That 's what you think . I do not understand why he keeps that old clock . It is a model 1962 - more than a hundred years . He says it 's more accurate than any spatial timer . - He 's just a fool . - But a lovely fool . I was not to be rising moon now ? It should . Maybe our space clock is wrong . I will call the Cmte . Zero . It was time for Zodiac be on the way . Why are they still not taken off ? We are awaiting the birth of the moon , Captain . Hey , Captain , where you hid the moon ? Already delayed 10 minutes . I need to go out to look for the LX7 . Exchange . I know it 's urgent Steve but something went wild . It would be better to call the teacher to make some calculations . Ok , I 'll wake him . What 's going on . It 's a fire or something ? Someone wants a cup of tea before we go ? Teacher , has the holy patience ! We need to work fast . X17 is missing . Just as the moon . Commander anything yet . And unanswered Space Echo as well . I do not like it even . According to my calculations , no disturbance or eruption It is happening in the vicinity of the Moon . She can not just have disappeared into space ? But he disappeared . It is two hours late . And the XL7 who was patrolling the area , He disappeared too . Steve fast . The Moon is coming after all . Ok Venus I 'm coming up there . Tell the Cmte . Zero . - See , there it is . - See how she is away . Something is very wrong . Full force . All checks are OK . Course 9-2-1-0 red . Marked and firm . Course 9-2-1-0 red . Marked and firm . Maximum speed . Staying the course . I understood . Cutting main force . Next stop , the moon . I will go back and see how the teacher is going . How long do you think we 'll be there , Professor ? Well we should get half an hour . If the space velocity remain constant . It is . And we still have time for a cup of tea . Professor , you and your cups of tea ! Yes , Teacher , you and your cups of tea . Yes , Teacher , you and your cups of tea . You ruined other equipment with that his contraption to make tea . You overheated and deformed . See ! Ohh , I .. I 'm sorry , Venus . I forgot . How about trying again , Professor ? And this time , it could be coffee ? Professor , I have to say : Your coffee is like your tea . There is no difference . Never mind , Professor , I think it 's good . That 's impossible . We have made no progress at all . The Moon is in the same position it was at half an hour ago . What does this mean ? I do not know yet . We will increase the space velocity . - I mean , shoot the boosters ? - Yes . We will use maximum force . Otherwise , we will lose track of the moon . Disparar boosters , Robert . Disparando boosters . Well ... That 's what happens when you want to be helpful and assist in cleaning . I 'll lock myself in my room in the future . Sorry . There was no time to warn you . This sort of thing is not good at my age . Pobre Professor . I hope he has not spoiled more no my equipment . See , we 're reaching . 7 space velocity increasing . That should suffice . Turn off the boosters . Turning off boosters . Our speed should remain constant now . 8.5 space velocity increasing . Increasing ? 9.5 ... 10 , increasing We are losing control . Switch to manual , Robert . On manual . 11 speed increasing . We 're out of control . We will not be aware for a long time . We need to contact Space City . See , the space clock . We should be in a some ultra magnetic field . Contacte Space City . Steve ! Steve ! You are going too fast . Very fast ! Fireball XL5 para Space city . Fireball XL5 para Space city . There is nothing , nothing we can do ! They diverted ! They strayed ! But where they are going , sir ? Course 2-4-9 . Course 2-4-9 . - We changed course . - We are no longer going to the moon ? Exactly . But we are still out of control . Out of control ? So where are we going ? Course 2-1-9-0 blue . Out of control . 2-1-9-0 blue ? Yes , like the XL7 we are out of control and going into the unknown . Whatever has dragged the moon 's orbit , You are dragging us fast . Hmm . That must be it . Well , what is the answer , Professor ? Where are we going ? According to my calculations , the planet Magneton . The magnetic planet . Of course ! The planet with the most powerful gravitational field do Universo . But somehow this field was increased thousands of times , to pull the moon and to us through the universe . Did you hear that , Steve ? Yes , but you need to see what I 'm seeing . Magneton is just ahead . Wow ! Ok , we 'll be right there . Magnet . A giant metal ball lifeless . Nor lifeless . We only have one chance . I will try to do the Fireball to turn around and drive maximum strength . You do not want to go . I did . Full force . Full force . It was close this time , Professor . Speed ​ ​ decreasing . Prepare for landing procedures . So far , so good . Come on . See Robert . He is out of action . Should be magnetic field effect on their electronics . - Poor Robert . - He 'll be fine . Come on . - All checked . - All checked . Oh , I never get used to using these infernal machines . Hey , check this out . Come investigate . I 'll take a look around . You could catch the flying belts in Jetmoveis , Venus ? Er ... Wait for me , Steve ! Hey , slow down , Teacher ! Uf ... I got . Hey , Teacher , look down there . A gigantic power room . Generating magnetic force . How can we get in ? Let us around the building . I do not see a door anywhere . Fast , Steve ! Teacher . Check this out . Some kind of scrap collector . What will all this , Professor ? Well , that should be being used as fuel By these generators . An ingenious method of using old junk . And look what is in the midst of old junk . Well , if this is the only way in is the way entering too . Well , use your flying belts . And take it easy this time , Professor . Look Venus , beware ! Professor ! Socorro , Steve ! Steve ! Help ! Professor Matic ! Ross ! It is .. You are the Ross , right ? Well , all right , Professor . Pilot Fireball XL7 . Chuck is also here . As spatial caught fish ! We need to get Prof. before a piece of junk fall on him . Do not worry , there is plenty of room here . Your friend already has company . Two other astronauts from Earth . Where does this voice ? It should be an amplifier somewhere . We 're right here in this room . And who are " we " ? We are the Solar . The Forge of the Universe . And I am the Super Solar . The supreme commander of the Solar here in Magneton . You can not see us land . But we are here and we can see you . Steve , they are invisible . Yes . We are invisible to you , the Earth people . and we will not accept that may interfere with our plans . And what are your plans ? Bring your Moon for our orbit then at last , we will not be creatures of darkness But there is light at Mgneton . Not if I can help . Arghh ! Urghh ! Arghh ! It seems that Steve contacted the Solar invisible . And if I know Steve , they will be the worst part of the deal . Cuidado Steve ! A garra ! That took care of the Solar . Now let 's take the teacher . Steve ! Steve ! He 's here , Professor . Will soon be out of here . Stand back . Okay , guys leave . Give a hand to the Professor . All are well ? Sure , fine . I just broke my glasses , that 's all . I 'm ... I 'm imagining things or someone turned on the light ? It is the moon . It is approaching . We need to reverse the force . Find the main switch . How long do we have ? By volta five minutes . It 's no use . We could not find or main switch . I .. I may be able to find it was up here . What are you doing , Professor ? Oh , it 's okay , Steve . I can get me . The lighting is so good . I can see . You did it ! You could , Teacher ! Yeah , I reverted strength , Steve . And the moon is coming back to its normal position . Now , can anyone tell me how to get out of here ? I can not see anything without my glasses . Do not worry . We take you there in a moment , Professor . Yeah , and then home , sweet home . Is not it wonderful to see the new moon ? I never noticed how much she means to us on Earth . I think we do not give attention to what is always close by . I know , Steve . Even if they are medical space . What do you mean ? It does not matter . Forget it . Translation - Neverlost
